16 2018-05-16 23:56:55 Best we can do is TRY and retain some manufacturing/ industrial jobs through policy, which the #resistance does everything to stop

58 2018-05-16 23:54:49 I think that protecting the environment is exactly what we need to do for young people.  We need clean water not filthy tar sand oil.
59 2018-05-16 23:54:44 And furthermore @Wilkinson4BC was just suggesting (via Twitter) that maybe trains pulling oil tanker cars along the rising Fraser River should be stopped from doing so while washouts are a risk. Would you believe gasoline at $5 a litre?? @GasBuddyDan
60 2018-05-16 23:54:43 Do you think China's new rail line to Iran could effect the desire for tar sand oil on the other side of the Pacific Ocean....Please do not invest my taxes on this.....I could give you a list of sustainable investments if you like.......

65 2018-05-16 23:54:05 Yes, we have had a handful of gun crimes in the UK. We tend to find them shocking not mundane and a price worth paying so ammosexuals can jerk off over their Chuck Norris poster using gun oil as lube.
66 2018-05-16 23:54:01 I've come to accept that me and women are like oil and water
67 2018-05-16 23:54:00 Despite rising yields, risk fought back to the #USD and #JPY overnight. The #AUD and #GBP making good gains. The #USDJPY parred loses and #Oil closed above $71.50.

69 2018-05-16 23:53:52 All good, after about a month of no “damn dirty oil” the gas prices will be so high in BC they will have to walk to the forest to hug the trees.

Possibly BC could abide by the federal approval of the project, that could help too.

74 2018-05-16 23:53:19 Yes , i watch the vidieo of the  troopers who was ambushed over seas - yes, our special forces did FORGET their break contact drills,  this is why THEY was killed.  If they was well oil in breaking contact at LEAST 50 percent would have made it out alive. This is JUST a fact!
75 2018-05-16 23:53:06 Not true - you are lying - there is not billions in tax revenues attached to the Little oil that ends up in Minnesota and Rosemont - total BS - no wonder @RepJasonLewis hired You #mn02

85 2018-05-16 23:52:01 Oil may save us from this financial mess in the near term. So much for the folks that cursed black gold, and said that fish will save us. So much for that theory. #nlpoli
86 2018-05-16 23:51:57 Checked. Found this. Charlotte's Web Hemp Extract comes in MCT Oil, which is fractionated coconut oil OR olive oil.  The only reason they're calling it CBD Oil is that it comes from the Cannibus plant.
87 2018-05-16 23:51:47 So....then....you're not being honest?
88 2018-05-16 23:51:37 As a big fan of yours since the Bloomberg days in Louisiana covering the oil spill, I’m so Sorry to hear this... but I’m sure bigger and better things are ahead
89 2018-05-16 23:51:28 But the point here is one is a non refutable belief system *which simply can't be understood literally* only metaphorically while the other is a refutable against nature theory which is understandable. Oil and water. We all use both. Both have a role to play in human intelligence
90 2018-05-16 23:51:19 Its not the money its the trip itself.. but hey i’d oil ya’ll scalp, trim ya ends and twist out ya’ll hair if i dont have to leave my house...

92 2018-05-16 23:51:05 I read a study about peppermint oil & hair growth. Epilepsy meds thin my hair a bit, so I tried it: peppermint essential oil + carrier oil, massaged into scalp.

100 2018-05-16 23:49:44 The new OIL narrative (con job): "The high price of oil and gas is because there are not enough pipelines to get crude to market."

117 2018-05-16 23:47:14 That’s straight palm oil
118 2018-05-16 23:47:01 I’m not happy with the team and it’s results like everyone else, but I’m a dirty rigger. 
I’ll never pretend to be an experienced hockey mind or capable of handling the pressure of building a team. I’ll stick to oil and swearing at roughnecks.
119 2018-05-16 23:46:57 Who will oversee if z owner of oil company is in charge of all other departments? Somalia needs strong judiciary system &strong foreign policy 4 foreign businesses & investors.There a only  2 branches of government in #Somalia run by 1 team(Executive and Legislative) No judiciary

128 2018-05-16 23:45:48 Sorry I don’t post more often. It’s hard working in the oil industry
129 2018-05-16 23:45:16 One of my mom's comfort foods was very very thinly slices corn tofu sautéed in olive oil and dipped in amino acids and vinegar. Omg, I just read that, it sounds terrible. But I love it.
130 2018-05-16 23:45:16 No surprise here.  Snake oil salesmen (and there are at least two of them involved here) just hate the power of sunlight.   #vanpoli

136 2018-05-16 23:44:17 It is really, really sad when the former oil co. exec is the ethical one in the Cabinet.
137 2018-05-16 23:44:01 So since Europe is apparently dumping the U.S dollar for oil trading with Iran, and Kim threatening to cancel the summit thus blowing up Trump's nobel peace prize hopes, when does Trump snap and start a huge ass war to maintain his and U.S legitimacy?
138 2018-05-16 23:43:56 I’m talking about keeping the rich rich and finding some way to get involved w/ the Middle East Every. Single. Time. and then setting up oil rigs because their there anyway. Trump got voted in by racists now he’s doing racist things ooo shocker. But notice the oil is a constant..

142 2018-05-16 23:43:32 そんなあるわけないだろ！
143 2018-05-16 23:43:21 You used the press conference about flooding to attack @jjhorgan on gas prices.  WTF.  It's almost like you care more about the impacts on oil than on people.
144 2018-05-16 23:43:20 My left brake light is out and since I changed my oil I might as well change the bulb too. Who needs a man when you have YouTube. 
145 2018-05-16 23:43:12 ちゃんと寝たよ

148 2018-05-16 23:43:08 Starting goalie is not much of an oil painting as well.
149 2018-05-16 23:43:07  I was cooking breakfast for the fam and the blowing hot cooking oil spraybacked into my eyes. Good morning AND NOW IT’S BLEEDING RED 
150 2018-05-16 23:43:02 All I wanted for my birthday this year was a full tank of gas & an oil change. Am I old or???
151 2018-05-16 23:42:53 By the time he reduce the gas by 10cents ,the big oil company and the government will have raise the price by at least 10 cents.
152 2018-05-16 23:42:49 an oil change is $55.... I’m just not ready for this adult thing
153 2018-05-16 23:42:35 I heard lavender oil works! I know a person that sells it. 
154 2018-05-16 23:42:33 Diluted bitumen versus refined products. It is not just Alberta oil. A little simplistic take there. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli
155 2018-05-16 23:42:29 all that grease and oil gives you the itis
156 2018-05-16 23:42:28 The PM and Notley are working on getting your oil to tidewater- this is how you thank them? Kenney did not do it when they were in govt! Do you just hate Liberals that much that you'll just say any stupid thing that pops in your head.
157 2018-05-16 23:41:49 @realDonaldTrump you and your family are nothing more than snake oil salesmen.  It actually makes it so much worse that you don't believe in anything you're selling.  You're clearly just in this to enrich yourselves.  You'll say and do anything to stroke your own ego.  Pathetic.
158 2018-05-16 23:41:36 Currently getting a hot oil treatment so that can only mean haircut day is tomorrow
159 2018-05-16 23:41:10 It makes my skin so soft and helps with absorption sooo less skin surface residue !! Which means less oil for me
160 2018-05-16 23:41:06 You’re a sheep who wants clicks but imagine if Gas was always a minimum of $3 and the extra money went to states for infrastructure?  Wouldn’t that promote green energy, reduce oil use and fix roads?  Stop spitting out trash articles and think on your own

168 2018-05-16 23:40:09 Any comments on the PM calling Canadians Racists, comparing ISIS returnees to Italian and Greek immigrants, Butts calling millions of people Nazis, Morneau calling a colleague a Neanderthal, and McKenna claiming oil workers are a threat to women. Or just her against her opponent?
169 2018-05-16 23:40:06 A blank cheque is unacceptable but the pipeline has to be built. People still need to drive, fly and need oil products. Saying a pipeline shouldn't be built make you a hypocrite, unless you don't drive, fly or use oil, oil based products and services with oil involved.
170 2018-05-16 23:40:00 Hmm, isn't George Soros involved in Oil and now in Tesla?
171 2018-05-16 23:39:52 Oh crap! What did they reinstate now?

US possible, oil pipeline?  Maybe a same interest in N. Korea?  Come on!  Whats it gonna take for Fox News to see the truth?

175 2018-05-16 23:39:09 What kind of oil is in those tanker cars?
176 2018-05-16 23:39:04 No :/. Did the litter box, picked up poop, cut fruit, made a smoothie, researched squalane oil, did my physics review, fed my dog watermelon,

181 2018-05-16 23:38:32 Hi Alexa.  It says Hemp Oil. See no references to CBD Oil.They are different. Hemp Oil is mainly a dietary supplement. Helps some people because it comes from the same plant cannibus plant. It also doesn't show the ingredients, i.e, how much hemp oil & how much if any CBD oil.
182 2018-05-16 23:38:29 Learned something today. Wool pants soak up water like a wick in a hurricane lamp soaks up oil. The umbrella does nothing ...
183 2018-05-16 23:38:15 If a sitting president can't be indicted, I guess Trump really can shoot someone right out on the street without consequences They kill millions in oil wars without consequence so why not?

186 2018-05-16 23:37:32  my CBD oil
187 2018-05-16 23:37:23 I work in the oil biz. I’m in favour of the pipeline. Rempel thinks she who yells loudest, wins the argument and, like George Costanza, a comedy character I might add, looking annoyed, being continually prickish, validates her argument. She’s funny and not in a good way. #cdnpoli
188 2018-05-16 23:37:23 You are more concerned about oil getting through rather than people who might have their homes and other property destroyed? You are not fit to be premier or leader of the BC Liberals!
189 2018-05-16 23:37:04 I really need to learn how to do an oil change

194 2018-05-16 23:35:54 LETS GET HIGH ON PERISCOPE!! Two new joints and a fresh gram of oil?!?! Fresh off work but I’ll change my shirt for ya5min
195 2018-05-16 23:35:45 I'm hoping rosehip oil works a lot better than it smells because the smell is very not good
196 2018-05-16 23:35:41 Not only that, without any break.. Two pillers of democracy are working and burning the midnight oil to save the first piller.
197 2018-05-16 23:35:38 I’m trying decide which kind of oil to put in my car... dudes says “it’s okay, take your time, I don’t mind standing here staring at ya for a bit”..... fuckin CRINGE.... lol

I just put cinnamon oil and lights on mine!
200 2018-05-16 23:35:15 like no weightless oil period ? yikes lol
201 2018-05-16 23:35:13 Maybe a drizzle of olive oil?!
202 2018-05-16 23:35:09 @LouDobbs $40 hr. jobs no college ED.  extracting oil from coal plant is 41% more world oil. Kentucky alone has more oil than IRAN.

205 2018-05-16 23:34:22 BC has to get their oil from somewhere and unfortunately what is woefully apparent is that BC would rather turn their backs on hard-working Canadians, (including BC’ers who made a quick dime in AB) and cut pipeline deals with US companies.  There is no disagreement, only betrayal
206 2018-05-16 23:34:19 Can't you at least admit that there is no immediate replacement for all the products that oil is used for?  I'm all for "green" power, but we are going to need oil during the long transition period.  Why shouldn't Canada be the ones to provide it?

209 2018-05-16 23:33:31 Thanks to the dicks in st clairsville who put my oil filter on so tight that it won’t come off, I’m covered in oil from head to toe sitting on a truck that has no oil in it. Happy freaking hump day.
210 2018-05-16 23:33:30 Magandang Umaga!! Opo dahil ang coconut at banana ay maganda mag moisturize ng balat at hinaluan po namin ito ng mga essential oil kaya po sya nag anti mosquito.  :)
211 2018-05-16 23:33:28 If Ford happens to win it would be interesting to see if the $0.10/L cut is enacted and then how long until the price meets or exceeds the amount just prior to the cut. It’s a billion dollar giveaway to the oil industry.
212 2018-05-16 23:33:23 All things in moderation, nevertheless, our bread is sugar free and with no dairy products while made with olive oil and a few simple ingredients, great for any diet. Good luck.

215 2018-05-16 23:32:36 Some EU companies are starting to fall in line with USA  against IRAN. Per GW News on pbs. France oil company is pulling a 1.2 BILLION dollars CONTRACT ETC. ETC and etc.
216 2018-05-16 23:32:14 Danny - it’s American funded protest groups opposing it. The USA is making a fortune off our inability to sell oil to the world market. The world demand isn’t going down. Canadian demand isn’t going down. You’re just drinking American funded koolaid.
217 2018-05-16 23:32:14 Oil rallied right into the last three recessions without causing stagflation. Check out the chart, it’s uncanny.

242 2018-05-16 23:27:54 Doesn't make sense.  Are you using the proper Diesel oil?  I can see if you're just using oil for a gas engine that soot will cause all sorts of wear issues.

250 2018-05-16 23:27:02 Ever tried CBD oil? It works just as well as opioids without the side effects and addiction. Trump wants to make all forms of medical marijuana legal, affordable, covered by insurance, & available. Unfortunately, his AG is compromised & co-opted on this issue by big pharma.
251 2018-05-16 23:27:01 I feel like they’ll need an extra long bench and maybe even two masseuses to adaquately rub oil on @Strippin’s back. And a lot of avocados for the face.

257 2018-05-16 23:26:18 Andrew, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. How can the green left rationalize obstructing  Gay friendly Oil while enriching Gay killing #bloodoil? @vancouverpride
258 2018-05-16 23:26:06 @RickPitinoWords we need jobs not college needed. a plant that extracts oil from coal is 41% more oil than IRAN has . a site in east Kentucky is ready but I need people to help get this built . the plant emits no pollution in air or water and the process was perfected in WW 11.
259 2018-05-16 23:25:53 It’s so infuriating what Trump and the GOP are doing to make life harder for the  people of this Country and getting away with it...gas and oil is going up exponentially and because of Trump pulling out of the Iran deal and destabilizing the Middle East it will only get worse.
260 2018-05-16 23:25:52 Harper never got oil to tidewater....that is what counts....$$$$$
261 2018-05-16 23:25:50 Jews are long ago done hearing low lifers like you if we "deserve" to be part of the human race. We are, and we have a HUGE positive footprint in the world in all areas of life. Muslims? not so much, eccept poluting oil and exporting terror!

264 2018-05-16 23:25:28 What IS the point? What are you concerned about? What bailout? If you don't want US companies profiting, why force Canadian oil through the US where they take a huge cut of the profit? What about gas and coal? And oil imports? I see no logical consistency in your position.

268 2018-05-16 23:25:21 Venezuelan here. Even if oil prices skyrocketed, there's so much fucking corruption here that the politicians would just steal even more money with no changes to our overall situation. And yes, fuck socialism.
269 2018-05-16 23:25:06 I’m not usually an “Orange party” voter, but Horgan is doing his job. The oil people haven’t really answered the question of how they will protect Burrard Inlet (Vancouver Harbour) from oil spills.  If they could address that the pipeline wouldn’t be a problem.
270 2018-05-16 23:25:04 what fucking oil have you been using
271 2018-05-16 23:24:59 yes but apparently you prefer to believe snake oil salesmen with severe gambling issues

273 2018-05-16 23:24:52 Baltic Dry Index still holding up around 1400. But higher oil prices will be lifting OPEX costs for ship owners so it probably needs to be higher. Your thoughts? @KaratzasMarine #shipping
274 2018-05-16 23:24:47 Commenter: Canada is a huge producer of hydrogen, but we waste it in helping the oil sands corporations do their thing. We could use this to power buses, like we see in the US. #ActiveTransportationSummit #ottcity
275 2018-05-16 23:24:19 That’s exactly why we have groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda because the US meddles with their oil it’s definitely not because their prophet told them to enforce jihad on any non believer

278 2018-05-16 23:24:16 I’m trynna find this curly head cutie who changes my cars oil every few months
279 2018-05-16 23:23:51 Oil prices are getting higher and higher but I don't think Venezuela will be able to recover from that alone. They kinda royally screwed themselves with bad government policies and Socialism.
280 2018-05-16 23:23:48 In trying 2b less toxic news we've switched from 3-1 oil to mineral oil for bike chains etc..I think it will work well/be far less toxic, there are warnings on 3-1 oil/it always makes me nervous lol. We've also given up commercial windshield wiper fluid/mix our own.
281 2018-05-16 23:23:43 For purposes of clarity, no be me and you dey drink oil. 
But if you want to insist I will ask around for the menu and send to you so you'll tell me what it tastes like. 
Peace my brother.

283 2018-05-16 23:23:41 Jason Kenney made a bad decision leaving a cushy federal job.

The economy is slowly rebounding and Alberta is diversifying, we'll  be just fine.

No need for another Conservative time where the rich get richer and we only focus on oil and gas.

286 2018-05-16 23:23:27 Which crooked c-''-s do you mean? The indigenous bands that have been paid by foreign groups to throttle Canada's oil industry?

289 2018-05-16 23:22:57 if the oil is hot enough to cook your food surely it's hot enough to decontaminate the spit.

Just to play Mike Ginn advocate here.

294 2018-05-16 23:22:36 The utilities in Mass. want ok to tell consumers they can reduce CO2 by switching from oil to gas. Tell them these stories. A better switch is to heat pumps.

296 2018-05-16 23:22:32 Looking for quick cash hmu if you need your yard cut, car washed, oil changes, paint your fence, walk your dog!!! Shit you name it
297 2018-05-16 23:22:32 Also, Hamas is an organization and not the government of the Palestinian People. In fact at the end of last year, the Palestinian National Authority was cutting funding and even oil/power to Hamas. It’s true they’ve worked together but at the end of the day Palestine is not Hamas

311 2018-05-16 23:20:57 Taking advantage of government subsidies for making us less dependent on foreign oil is a bad thing? Still don't understand why states like Iowa got a bunch of shit for investing in wind energy.
Are you saying that over the last 5 years tesla has made out better because of subs.?
312 2018-05-16 23:20:56 @EPAblog I agree !!!  ..."Scott Pruitt, errand boy for the oil, gas and chemical industries, continues to fleece taxpayers and poison the environment. But will there be a reckoning?"  And YES, there will be a reckoning. Can't avoid your karmic dues.
313 2018-05-16 23:20:43 Make sure to keep your face really close to the oil and keep your eyes wide open so you can see what happens next
314 2018-05-16 23:20:43 Hay alex lets smear Trump on high gas prices for nothing. Sanctions on these oil countries Venezuela Russia Iran..hell trump wont even let lybia pump hardly any oil. We don't care about Trump and his floozies.old news yawn.

327 2018-05-16 23:19:28 The gas and oil subsidies keep the price of fuel lower than it should be, if we dont do that the poor will be disproportionately impacted so in reality the poor benefit.

I left my mom alone for 2 minutes and she puts gas in the oil tank of our lawn mower.
331 2018-05-16 23:19:00 Why is it that when I go get my oil changed, they ask me if they can check my cabin air filter, engine filter, rotate my tires, change my wipers, or flush my transmission? Dude, I just want you to change my oil. That’s it.

333 2018-05-16 23:18:36 Not having Trans Mountain means more money for all other oil producing countries. Canada’s oil is BEST.
334 2018-05-16 23:18:33 "Liberals are giving Texas oil company #KinderMorgan a blank cheque while dumping all the risks on Canadians. Rigged process, First Nations & local communities shut out, oil spill threats, science ignored & now billions on the line. It's clear this pipeline should not be built."
335 2018-05-16 23:18:23 You do realise this is not the point. Keep it in the ground, change the concept of fossil fuels being the main resource, stop bailing out American oil companies, move forward to an environmentally friendly of living. We only have this planet. And YES I am EXTREMELY CONCERNED.
336 2018-05-16 23:18:22 I gave my car  a oil change and filters she is living her best life!  
You she need it after yesterday!
337 2018-05-16 23:18:18 Cooking tip: to check if your oil is hot enough, spit into the pan.
338 2018-05-16 23:18:18 Need a foot run, hot bath, oil massage, to be appreciated uh It's so hard wearing this  lol.
339 2018-05-16 23:18:14 Like oil companies? I want you to think for a moment if the government didn't minimize risk for them financially. Oil would go up so gas goes up, I do well so I maybe spend 1% of my $ on gas but someone who doesn't make much may spend 10%, without subsidies they'll spend 15%..

346 2018-05-16 23:17:06 It was oil that caused workers to lose their jobs in #Alberta. Maybe the province should not have squandered their oil wealth for 44 years and need to diversify their economy. They have no right to force pipelines on us. #AlbertaBullies #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM

356 2018-05-16 23:15:57 Look at the bottle and check and see how many mg of actual CBD Oil.  If it only says Hemp Oil, then that's all you got. Hemp Oil.  CBD Oil is usually taken at around 25 mg.  That's what I take.
357 2018-05-16 23:15:47 I thought that’s why Tillerson worked for Trump?  Pandering an alternative reality in order to get those oil leases opened up for Exxon?  His late come-to-Jesus moment seems a little insincere and self promoting - no courage when he had the power!!

402 2018-05-16 23:08:54 personally i dont truly give correlations much weight cuz theyre not constant - fundamental price inputs are, however. so higher oil = higher input costs cuz what doesnt have plastic or petroleum derived inputs these days? so thats how i look at that

421 2018-05-16 23:06:50 That isnt an American chart. It’s the global benchmark price for oil/gas which is priced in USD. Clearly you know nothing about commodities.

Gas is HEAVILY taxed in this province, it’s a fact. If you’re arguing it’s not, you’re not tuned into reality
422 2018-05-16 23:06:44 James 5:14 - Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
423 2018-05-16 23:06:43 Baby oil and loose highlight
424 2018-05-16 23:06:28 Because you're smart!
425 2018-05-16 23:06:24 Snake oil salesmen. I agree
426 2018-05-16 23:06:23 If the B.C. Gov't is so much against pipelines, why aren't they trying to shut down the one that has been going for 53 years? 

Oh yeah, they still need oil and gas there....

Shut it down and see what happens
427 2018-05-16 23:06:05 To be fare, hiding that piece of canvas with oil on it where the public can't see anymore is far more important that feeding or housing our fellow Americans.
428 2018-05-16 23:05:50 Hey I thought Iran wanted lower oil pricing.  Should be no problem.
429 2018-05-16 23:05:25 It wasn't about oil during the six day war, it was about protection and security.  It's height allowed Syrian snipers to fire down on Israelis.  For that reason it was spoils of war and wasn't returned.  IMHO
430 2018-05-16 23:05:13 Heat and niggas is like water and oil
431 2018-05-16 23:05:03 Let it go, Elon. And Fox is in cahoots with big oil. Of course they’re going to target you! Biggest threat they’ve seen. Keep doing you, keep Tesla doing its good work. Progress can’t be stopped. (And those kids will have some great ideas!)
432 2018-05-16 23:04:55 Fila is all about the sauce/Waffle fries for me.

433 2018-05-16 23:04:54 I put lavender oil on my pillow to improve my sleep and it’s actually helped so much, smells good and I fall asleep pretty quick now
434 2018-05-16 23:04:34 AI software keeps it within a corridor that can be set from 15 feet - 50 miles wide. They avoid major shipping lanes, oil rigs, and buoys. If a drone senses it’s going slower than expected, it concludes it’s caught in netting and starts to reverse to get free.

436 2018-05-16 23:04:00 With everyone seeming to "know" #WTI oil is going to 75, 80, 100, I'm finding it harder and harder to believe that's the case. Very crowded long trade. #CL_F
437 2018-05-16 23:03:43 No, they hate the US because we’ve been meddling in the Mideast ever since oil was discovered there.
438 2018-05-16 23:03:42 Maybe I can help? Are you expecting to get fresh bud, oil, hash? Dm me a pix if you can. Given the little I know of your complex problems, I’d speculate you’re being given it for help w/chronic pain? Any way, dm when you can, see if I can help.  #painsux
439 2018-05-16 23:03:40 I enjoy Prado museum very much, wish to get English translation.
I remember the big oil painting of some queen's funeral .  I'd like to meet it again.
440 2018-05-16 23:03:36 Blending is WAY better with oil. I started buying starter packs when they’re on sale, but I haven’t really painted a lot with them yet.
441 2018-05-16 23:03:34 Just gave my mom some cbd oil  let’s see how she likes it
442 2018-05-16 23:03:23 2/2. Alberta cannot lawfully target BC by pricing or reducing its supply of oil or gas to BC alone. Bill 12 can only authorize turning off the taps to all provinces, thus shooting both Alberta & its oil & gas industry in both feet. Smart, eh?
443 2018-05-16 23:02:39 trying to get my mother to understand the benefits of CBD oil has got to be the most annoying and tedious task

455 2018-05-16 23:01:32 so what do we think correlation between oil and 10yr yield is this year?  0.8 maybe?  no question central banks need oil high to get out of QE. oil at $40 where do you think EU inflation would be?
456 2018-05-16 23:01:29 Big oil owns our government.

465 2018-05-16 22:59:35 My protein iron stomach bowl I make consists of this; Kale, Spinach, Watercress, mixed nuts, two hard boiled eggs, olive oil, sardines, and salt. Combined with Green Machine Naked Juice. 

It tastes like Hell. Being healthy takes its tolls.
466 2018-05-16 22:59:25 Mr. Kenney. Which of these pipelines take Alberta oil to even one non-US market, the way #TMX will? What did you do to close price differential? I know that you care about Alberta but we lost ten years of opportunity to diversify our oil markets under your gov’t.
467 2018-05-16 22:59:23 So you guys heard of that rule where if someone dies during a final everyone in the class passes? Well I just happen to know theres a person with a peanut allergy in my class so guess whos gonna bathe in peanut oil and sit next to him on finals week
468 2018-05-16 22:59:11 Because dirty hair has more oil, and volume from movement and random blasts of car exhaust.
469 2018-05-16 22:58:55 Start a war, up go oil prices...
470 2018-05-16 22:58:44 Don't know what is good or bad news. We are looking for justice from the rotten justice system in India. That's the change we want.
471 2018-05-16 22:58:30 The snake oil salesman and proud Israeli shill pushing others to denounce authoritarians. What a laugh. 

You are a disgusting fraud Jordan.
472 2018-05-16 22:58:29 What type of oil y’all use to make plantains
473 2018-05-16 22:58:28 復活できそうなの？
474 2018-05-16 22:58:10 Because it smells of blood and money and oil across the Iraqi land

475 2018-05-16 22:57:39 What’s clear is that opposers are ill-informed & hypocritical, oil demand is going nowhere, by opposing the pipeline we are giving up our economy to SA & US, & the majority wants this pipeline built. What’s most clear, you will never be PM w/this mentality.

481 2018-05-16 22:56:36 Oil needs to stop going up every day for the treasury longs
482 2018-05-16 22:56:21 This is false.  Best way t keep it from happening? Be willing to pay for oil that doesn't come from sensitive areas.  It is, ultimately, the consumer that wants cheap oil.  Producers just want to make $ producing it. They don't care where it comes from, so long as it makes money.
483 2018-05-16 22:56:16 i think i tried them but are they supposed to be that glittery?? like it’s glitter in oil kinda thing??
484 2018-05-16 22:56:10 BC: We don’t want your oil!
Notley: *Turns off giant tap*
BC: No, no, no. We mean oil before it’s ready to use. The other stuff for cars and shit is good.
485 2018-05-16 22:56:05 Sounds perfect to me. Or a little garlic olive oil to dip it in.
486 2018-05-16 22:55:55 Maintenance definitely has a cost vary depending on the car. A Benz will have more expensive parts than a Honda and require more expensive oil.
487 2018-05-16 22:55:53 the oil is so expensive. but it’s lasted me a while now since I learned through therapy a few more triggers for my anxiety! I can’t have actual THC because makes me panicky and horrible
488 2018-05-16 22:55:51 I’m off dairy to see my body’s reaction to it. I use MCT oil in my coffee now

492 2018-05-16 22:55:27 Correction coconut oil
493 2018-05-16 22:55:17 I am... sceptical. 

I do, however, hate standing over a pan spitting oil at me.
494 2018-05-16 22:55:16 All government has to do is regulate the prices to a reasonable level and stop the price gouging but oil companies. Just look a the reported profits. Stop using tax dollars to buy votes. The free market is not working with the corporate greed in charge
495 2018-05-16 22:55:16 荒野行動を許すな
496 2018-05-16 22:55:14 yes! but the olive oil is the best one
497 2018-05-16 22:55:09 Yeah I've heard it's super sticky. And that price tag for what it is. I want to try Sol de Janero's new body oil.
498 2018-05-16 22:55:02 Pubgは腰撃ちが弱いって言われてたけど、スコープ全然拾えないから余り意味がないんだ
499 2018-05-16 22:54:58 Oil before. Get it nice and hot to get a good crust
500 2018-05-16 22:54:40 While there's an effect in the imposition of excise tax to oil, continued hike in oil price causes the inflation to spike. Price of diesel was at lowest of P25/l last Jan now it's P42/l.  Excise tax effect is only P2.5/l. The P14.5 price increase since Jan makes the difference.
501 2018-05-16 22:54:04 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
502 2018-05-16 22:53:57 Don't I know it. And the incredible hurdles to build big solar v drilling oil or gas just pays land rent $1.50/acre V. solar rent of up to $16K/acre if you want to build near big loads like Los Angeles.
503 2018-05-16 22:53:57 if youre going against my god given right to protect myself and my family you dont get positive discourse
504 2018-05-16 22:53:51 If you make a claim to your insurance, they will know who insures the oil spill people.
505 2018-05-16 22:53:38 So I had a dream that I was making french fries and the fryer got too hot and over flowed and started to catch thing on fire. When I woke up I thought I still heard the oil over flowing but... I have a fish tank in my room and the filter was making that same noise....

519 2018-05-16 22:52:31 FYI if Dan is such a expert he should know that the oil companies have been putting additives in gas in the summer for years just as they have in the winter for condensation. But hey if the general public doesn’t know it’s a great excuse!

523 2018-05-16 22:51:48 I worked for an oil company for three years. I worked the rates at which we sold it ,to actually working with the EPA to regulate it. There is a winter blend and a summer blend. Ironically winter blend gives you lesser gas mileage.
524 2018-05-16 22:51:42 Used the new fragrance from Glade Atmosphere Collection in the Jasmine Cedarwood scent. I have always loved the smell of jasmine essential oil and this is a light scent that is not too overpowering!@Glade #bzzagent #gotitfree

537 2018-05-16 22:49:39 So @dave_eby and @jjhorgan claim they have the constitutional authority to restrict Alberta oil shipments through BC, but also claim that AB doesn't have the constitutional authority to restrict shipments of oil to BC. Desperate, desperate clowns. #KinderMorgan #TransMountain
538 2018-05-16 22:49:37 It certainly has that kind of stink, but it’s not the pipeline corps, and it’s not the big international oil corps. So who? The pathetic #tarsands operators. Is it Pierre Trudeau’s Petro-Canada come back as Suncor to control the son?

541 2018-05-16 22:49:16 Would be honest anyway to make it clear that he was talking about MS-13 gang members, not all the illegal immigrants. Otherwise you could be accused of throwing oil on the fire, i.e. of doing exactly the opposite of what you intend to do.

544 2018-05-16 22:48:05 *(Weird thought)* I put oregano oil in my armpit to fight a skin condition I have. It was initially the worst but eventually a very good decision because it did work to combat it. if you have tried oregano oil you understand the crippling pain I was in. Try it if ur brave
545 2018-05-16 22:47:42 Very little vs what’s bring proposed! At the scale of 7X’s what is being shipped out now, the proposal is not what is going on today or what’s been going on for the past 60 years! We’ve NEVER had this volume of oil it these number of tankers loading and passing through Vancouver!

549 2018-05-16 22:46:39 Lol.. Canadians, compensate a Texas Oil Corp for voicing our rights and working a democratic system?  #barf
550 2018-05-16 22:46:19 if oil exports are limited, who suffers more? BC or the province who survives on oil? #bcpoli
551 2018-05-16 22:46:17 You ain’t getting $1 a day to make Jordan’s in factories in China, you ain’t getting bombed because you live close to opium and oil fields, and the UK is just garbage nobody wants to live there anyways.
552 2018-05-16 22:46:13 You know who’s hurting Canada?

Trump.

Everyone, left and right, agrees that NAFTA renegotiations and U.S. tax cuts are driving away investments in Canadian oil and gas. They only disagree on whether or not Trudeau should have responded with his own tax cuts.

Good night.

556 2018-05-16 22:45:33 NDP logic..shut in production and kill Jr oil companies barely surviving now ...in order to save them.
557 2018-05-16 22:45:32 @sensfoundation - is there a similar program available to support some of our local associations and the @Senators 
Looks like a great program!
558 2018-05-16 22:45:30 @realDonaldTrump selling 2/2 the strategic oil reserve only makes sense if you plan on selling above $80 to put a ceiling on the cost of gasoline and buy below $60 such that you keep US shale producers still producing at a profit. Might work as an economic tool.
559 2018-05-16 22:45:11 use oil
tnx
560 2018-05-16 22:45:09 The statistics might scare you otc. At Walmart i cant tell you how many people bring anything from Benz’s to Mercedes in there and get the cheapest oil package. And complain about how much the dealer charges for it.

My mom: we should go get some cannabis oil when you come down 

564 2018-05-16 22:44:49 Wrong , sorry. Waste and pollution in mining, transporting and especially refineries (use energy output of a small town!) much higher for oil. Then batteries do not leave waste, they get reused (eg homes) and eventually Lithium in them can be recycled. Unlike petrol thats burnt.

Use our bones to stoke the embers,

572 2018-05-16 22:43:34 Principally, yes. Which generally ties in rich inheritors too.

Nearly all seemingly intractable problems we have as a country can be viewed as benefitting some big contributor. Often the oil & gas industry.
573 2018-05-16 22:43:34 People complain about gas prices but that reflects how good the oil and gas Industry is doing...
574 2018-05-16 22:43:16 Simply need to ban Islam from America - the cult is insane and so are their followers. Let Europe fry in the rancid oil of this ideology.

576 2018-05-16 22:42:52 There's a moronic sucker born every minute. The only way DoFo can do that is to reduce the provincial gasoline tax (thus increasing Ontario's deficit). What he can't do is prevent our foreign-owned oil companies from increasing the price of gasoline. #onpoli #cdnpoli

579 2018-05-16 22:42:40 It’s brand new it’s gone be more than 20 but I would get the Honda lol I ain’t tryna pay $50 for an oil change 
580 2018-05-16 22:42:38 Oil: Is Cdn Gov’t going to let go of old ways-destructive fossil fuel based unhealthful biz, or move its ppl into the future as a free Society & be a world leader showing the planet our clean green energy example?

584 2018-05-16 22:42:06 O___o
Odd that it decided to fail /NOW/ instead of right afterwards....
Huh.... welp, I’m glad it was something simple at least.
But yeah, didn’t know you changed your own oil~ 
=^___^=
585 2018-05-16 22:42:01 And even today brazilian Credit is not as bad as it should given how much oil and $PBR weight on the economy
586 2018-05-16 22:42:00 “Pure CBD oil has not yet been associated with adverse health effects,” the Army said, nonetheless adding that “soldiers are prohibited from using hemp or products containing hemp oil.”
Thats from the united states armys offical statement.
587 2018-05-16 22:41:58 baby oil is awesome
588 2018-05-16 22:41:55 I'm wondering if this period would have been a good occasion to apply the export price norm advocated by @MaMoMVPY , instead of NGDP targeting. Perhaps Lars would have advocated a larger drop in the Canadian currency (i.e less international borrowing) to match the oil price fall.
589 2018-05-16 22:41:53 So you’re saying that westridge terminal has not been shipping oil through Burrard Inlet for 60 years and tankers from westridge terminal don’t go to Asia? .... 

You’re not serious are you???
590 2018-05-16 22:41:36 @SteaknShake on Ridge Avenue in Cincinnati needs to change their oil. These fries are disgusting!

596 2018-05-16 22:41:00 @jensfest @alexkarevoll @AudunAbelsnes So we're guessing the program name would be altered to 'Techstars in partnership with 'equinor', Mckinsey and Kongsberg.
597 2018-05-16 22:40:55 just let the world warm up, than we will not need oil to heat our homes

600 2018-05-16 22:40:43 Its an interesting documentary. Its not just about Oil but about trouble makers set up by the establishment to infiltrate the Independence movement to cause trouble.
601 2018-05-16 22:40:39 Once again, we are talking about more than one oil tanker being loaded each and every day, in good weather and bad. Based on only a starting number now with incredible pressure to increase the traffic once it’s twinned to Westridge. That’s a 7X’s increase for starters!

1) Drink PLENTY of water

3) Eat your fruits and veggies 
4) Invest in raw/organic coconut oil ITS WORTH IT 

And most importantly. 
5) MIND YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS SIS

620 2018-05-16 22:35:55 The US pulled out of the Iran deal, will apply sanctions to Iran and possibly countries that trade with it. What does this mean for SA consumers?

Iran is one of the biggest exporters of oil, if their supply to the world is decreased this can increase price of oil. Assuming
621 2018-05-16 22:35:45 @pingstoncreek whatever plastic wrap you guys decided to use for the Banana GSC concentrate tears super easy and makes it near impossible to get the oil off of it. Just a heads up
622 2018-05-16 22:35:35 Got that oil change and my gas been lasting longer. I haven’t had to put gas in the car in about 2 weeks
623 2018-05-16 22:35:30 Luxury car insurance is high as hell and to fix that old Benz with all foreign parts are way higher. It’s like 100 for an oil change. The Honda insurance and the Benz luxury insurance with probably be the same. But the Honda will be way cheaper to maintain.
624 2018-05-16 22:35:24 i literally need to stop eating bread and pasta and dairy and oil and basically italian food it's fucking me up
625 2018-05-16 22:35:10 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
626 2018-05-16 22:35:07 I also hardly use oil when cooking. I just use a dash and then all the rest is cooked with water... salt I use lightly too! I use herbamare salt it’s GREAT
627 2018-05-16 22:35:04 I'm cooking some sausages rn for leftovers tomorrow. I'm gonna slice em up and toss them with some mushroom ravioli, olive oil and sundried tomatoes. I'm having "fuck it" meals all week this week.

629 2018-05-16 22:34:50 Nice to hear @TheCurrentCBC raise issue of climate change in connection with B.C. Interior floods. Good context and a reminder that we're entering a new normal. A good follow might be to explore legal cases against Big Oil and whether there could be legal liability. @Eric_Doherty
630 2018-05-16 22:34:49 Not sure if you know what that word means. How many blank cheques has the green party given to foreign oil companies?
631 2018-05-16 22:34:23 Don’t lose it! Also use grease for this type of mechanism. Oil doesn’t support this type of mechanism. Grease offers a longer term friction reduction.
632 2018-05-16 22:34:21 Are you trying to buy up to $35? Or you only want the klairs cleansing oil?

642 2018-05-16 22:32:41 Most people don't have a basic understanding about how sensitive the vaginal area is to dirt, oil, or common bacterial infections that can be found on a persons' hand or know that for your partner's health you're suppose to wear a clean latex free rubber glove.
643 2018-05-16 22:32:36 I have a LOT of new likes on this page...and thank you for that. But after my business closeout sale May 26, this page will close!!

652 2018-05-16 22:31:14 Listen to all these dummy’s from Alberta crying about their precious oil money. Especially their childish premiere. The bottom line is he wants to protect BC and it’s coast so it doesn’t end up looking like the shitty wasteland known as Alberta.

681 2018-05-16 22:27:08 California is right to update building codes with renewables in mind.  It makes financial sense.  Sorry oil industry, but you've delayed gasoline's obsolescence way too long...
So anyway, what are your thoughts about global warming?
682 2018-05-16 22:27:08 Not particularly well thought out reply
683 2018-05-16 22:27:03 What if there are anomalies in message that need highlighting ? Is that not part of the discourse to point out when they are being sold snake  oil?

690 2018-05-16 22:26:05 PC govt was running half billion dollar deficits when price of oil was over $100. No one seemed to mind then?
691 2018-05-16 22:26:01 You almost make Donald Trump look competent.

How the fuck did an entire Province get stuck with such a greedy cow as you in charge?

You are an epic failure. One year from now, you'll be working at a gas STATION, not for oil companies pocketbooks.
692 2018-05-16 22:26:00 i just used cactus & an apricot face scrub & baby oil after,  my skin never looked so aliveeee

695 2018-05-16 22:25:41 Call me mater from cars 3 cause I'm gonna drink a gallon of oil
696 2018-05-16 22:25:34 So when you are in IMS “learn mode” you can press the SCV to the retract detent, wait for it to finish its countdown, then press it a second time, wait for countdown, then press save. We also turn off our metering rollers to help with oil flow when lifting out the ground with IMS
697 2018-05-16 22:25:24 Me too... I think it has something to do with the oil
698 2018-05-16 22:25:07 Nothing better than coming home from a 15 hour shift and lathering myself in coconut oil after a hot shower

703 2018-05-16 22:24:41 Look at these hypocrites, bp had the biggest oil spill in the history of petroleum, one of the largest oil and gas companies and polluters in the world.
704 2018-05-16 22:24:37 Coconut oil fixes everything.
705 2018-05-16 22:24:33 use a sea salt and distilled water mixture and let it soak. you can also put tea trea oil on after. and don’t touch your nose ring a lot with your hands
706 2018-05-16 22:24:26 Castor oil
707 2018-05-16 22:24:20 What I’m saying is that US retail gas prices are the highest they’ve been in three years, and although a lot of it is to do with shortage of oil, but also because trump just pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal
708 2018-05-16 22:24:00 Says tattoos are trashy, is probably an Oil field dope fiend 
709 2018-05-16 22:23:55 Where can I find this planet of Octopus? I will bring charcoal, salt, olive oil and lemon.

712 2018-05-16 22:23:15 Love it that is the Oil twitterverse in one article. Chia gets shit for doing and not doing.This is what we are told we need, a cheap guy that might fill a role. Do we have anyone like him ? Yes Bear but why not let him hone his craft without the crazy EDM media and lime light.
713 2018-05-16 22:23:09 I know it's too hot in my room when my container of coconut oil is completely liquid
714 2018-05-16 22:23:06 If there is an explosion in North Burnaby due to @TransMtn expansion, the alleged road block from Camp Cloud will be a child's play, as oil storage tanks explosion will make North Burnaby a HELL ON EARTH
715 2018-05-16 22:22:45 Hope they're not counting oil rig associated gas for NG production.
716 2018-05-16 22:22:31 the Palmer's cocoa butter body oil is my favorite and it makes my skin so SMOOTH
717 2018-05-16 22:22:25 After watching a handful of these Zuckerburg trial clips I feel like an alarming amount of congressmen and congresswomen still live in log cabins using oil lamps and printing presses.
718 2018-05-16 22:21:51 It’s annoying though because with my mileage being so high my car is ALWAYS in the shop like I need an oil change damn near every month and it’s annoying

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
722 2018-05-16 22:21:12 We use a lot of coconut oil and another one which I forget right now
723 2018-05-16 22:21:02 Perhaps one difference is that Azerbaijan was never confronted with a robust, international multi-stakeholder pledge not to use oil from Azerbaijan if human rights abuses persist. #PressureandPrincipledEngagementWork
724 2018-05-16 22:20:47 Lets all increase the OIL prices.  Is it all about Greed?
725 2018-05-16 22:20:41 Let’s not forget the children Bill Clinton had killed in Waco in 1993.
726 2018-05-16 22:20:41 when i take oil of oregano I burp pizza flavour lol
727 2018-05-16 22:20:24 I also want to know the numbers on cold oil compared to the warm oil. Can that be seen as diet pizza?
728 2018-05-16 22:20:22 Would anyone not working for an oil company actually shed a tear if Rachel Notley were eliminated?

I cant believe a Premier in CANADA is threatening to try and pass a bill to selectively try to bully another Province into destroying the environment for their greed.

733 2018-05-16 22:19:49 Calm down lad. City funded by oil money have won a few trophies. Well done fella .
734 2018-05-16 22:19:33 It’s so hard when you love vintage but you tryna cop new shit but you also need casual clothes and your hair done plus a refill. Did I mention the oil change? Oh and you need your lashes done  being a female is expensive!! Even if you don’t get your lashes done or wear weave.
735 2018-05-16 22:19:26 Hate the feeling of going to bed with coconut oil on my hair but will so be worth it when the sun is glistening off my shiny smooth hair tomorrow
736 2018-05-16 22:19:24 Did my laundry earlier and just got oil on my shorts  so that’s fun
737 2018-05-16 22:19:23 NOW he’s promising to reduce gas $ .10 / liter which will cut over another billion from revenues! Boy is Ontario in for a surprise when the debt starts to pile up!! Ford is an imbecile (like tRUMP) and Ontario is going to fall for this snake oil salesperson!
738 2018-05-16 22:19:08 He was in the oil business making more money in a week than those presidents made in a year. Who was president then didn't matter because they all bend the knee to big oil, always have.

748 2018-05-16 22:17:22 This is the level of punlic morality.The parties do not trust their own MLAs.Not trusting them is a speculation.And why SC should burn midnight oil on the speculation of the parties that their MLAs are purchadable commodities.

I got a call to pick it up because its ready. I get here and find out it still on hoist with no oil and your guys are out of oil. lollolol

762 2018-05-16 22:15:20 CURSED SALAD. I ate some toasted bread with olive oil and now I feel better! barfing scares me a lot so I'm glad it didn't happen
763 2018-05-16 22:15:10 It’s interesting to know that as citizens of Canada we don’t have as much value to our own government as an oil company. Our tax dollars which should be funding things that we really need will be subordinate to the oil kings.
764 2018-05-16 22:15:04 Totally pissed off about these wars for oil. The next one will be for water.
765 2018-05-16 22:15:02 The price of gas in BC isn't because of a Texas oil corporations pipeline, @Wilkinson4BC.

We've had the highest gas in North America for as long as I can remember.    60 cents of tax on a litre of gas here, tax YOU added when in govt.   #bcpoli
766 2018-05-16 22:14:57 Prophetic, couple of oil price spikes too helped.  Very lucky run of events generally!
767 2018-05-16 22:14:53 Ion know how I stumbled into feminist Twitter but it reeks of kuntae oil, a pack of Family Dollar batteries and Nissan Sentra exhaust
768 2018-05-16 22:14:47 Olive oil that's good enough to slurp/swig
769 2018-05-16 22:14:41 This country is underperforming. We missed the boat. We are starting to see a  slow down in global demand for oil. This just may be the top of the cycle. We choked. This government choked.
770 2018-05-16 22:14:33 I didn’t write a formal lesson for this but I can tell you we learned about: Louis C. Tiffany, Art Nouveau, color theory, and used nature for inspiration!  Drawings are oil pastel on black paper. Requirement was to have border, pattern, & 3 ’s
771 2018-05-16 22:14:30 That’s been the national operating directive of gov’t vis a vis the oil and gas sector since its inception #cdnpoli
772 2018-05-16 22:14:14 A lot of people have tried to go back and forth with me because of course with it being an oil, excess use can clog your pores and it would have an adverse effect. But when used how I use it then it’s really beneficial
773 2018-05-16 22:14:12 @jkenney Since when did Harper 'lay' any oil pipelines As Usual FAKE NEWS resonates with the ultra right. Harper sat on his hands for 10yrs!!! still 1'existing line' to BC & NB is still importing 56% of CANADIAN needed oil from mid-east How about the TRUTH sometime REFRESHING!!!

781 2018-05-16 22:12:46 Tories never wanted Scots to have a devolved Parliament (neither did Labour tbh but I'm sure a few oil fields swung it) 

Was it not the EU who forced the issue? I could be wrong tho..
782 2018-05-16 22:12:39 The oil makes the difference

790 2018-05-16 22:12:09 The overwhelming majority of indigenous people support the pipeline. I hope you’re out protesting against the increasing number of tankers brining foreign oil to our shores, the pipeline being built bringing jet fuel up from the US into BC.

795 2018-05-16 22:11:39 Rick Anderson, Director of the Manning Centre, undoubtedly hangs around people who have negative things to say about Justin Trudeau. I'm absolutely shocked.

810 2018-05-16 22:10:11 Good thing your boats will be docked because there will not be enough oil. Same thing with your stores (no food), transportation (your compass cards won’t work on the buses), planes, medical vehicles, your cars (can’t escape the city), and some places won’t have electricity.

815 2018-05-16 22:09:06 Just watched that; agreed on arguments. Strange world though that higher oil is leading to higher $ via US rates. Unchecked, higher oil leads to massive risk off, which is also $ supportive. All this comes undone when a global recession takes hold. Then alpha becomes the trade.

Who can forget Goja’s famous juxtapositional oil on canvas “Cat doing downward-facing Dog”

831 2018-05-16 22:07:54 Maybe we are & maybe we're not. My concern is the BC coast, waste of resources being spent as subsidies for the oil industry (soon to grow under Trudeau), the ignoring of indigenous rights, NEB environmental assessment that was biased & flawed, and the undermining of democracy.
832 2018-05-16 22:07:53 organized labor have been FIXING oil prices
833 2018-05-16 22:07:50 Can’t wait to put oil on my hair tomorrow. Exam season has left me looking traumatised
834 2018-05-16 22:07:44 .@PnPCBC @jkenney leads an unpopular Conservative Party that has run out of other parties to merge with.

He now represents an eclectic gaggle of intolerant religious bigots, that run on crude oil, & who will switch to coal, when that runs out.

835 2018-05-16 22:07:39 Pasta with cherry tomatoes marinaded in paprika, chilli (you can leave it out if you don't like it), a little bit of garlic and cayen powder, fry the tomatoes in a tiny bit of oil for a minute and mix them in. It's my fave comfort food and it's so nice 
836 2018-05-16 22:07:34 Trains are a perfectly ok way to transport bitumen. Its solid and not flammable. This isn't an "oil" line, its a dilbit line.
837 2018-05-16 22:07:29 Lol, wouldn’t have expected less from you, so shallow, so transparent, so predictable........
838 2018-05-16 22:07:29 I don't use it, but I can anecdotally vouch for CBD oil. Helped my dad get off opioid pain killers for his arthritis!
839 2018-05-16 22:07:24 Yep. It's as though "1group culture has dominion over thought for the rest. Had anyone gotten a fix or fixed oil leaks in Dakota? Veteran suicides; pesticide water/air pollution? No? Why not?
840 2018-05-16 22:07:18 I am a robot. I piss oil
841 2018-05-16 22:07:00 *alluded ;-)
842 2018-05-16 22:06:58 Whoa what a hot damn day. Been sweating my ass off all day outside. Thank god for tanning oil and sunscreen
843 2018-05-16 22:06:37 Just gave my car its first oil change since 2013
844 2018-05-16 22:06:33 I just did a face mask and took the longest hottest shower and slathered my self in coconut and rose oil and omg I feel like a new person
845 2018-05-16 22:06:33 There a old saying it take money to make money. Billions and billions of dollar have been invested in the oil sand. Trans Canada have investment billions of dollar and now the federal government will help out with extra cost. Don’t forget our infrastructure run on oil and gas.
846 2018-05-16 22:06:31 Please make sure it says CBD Oil & not Hemp Oil.  If it says Hemp Oil, you're not getting the true CBD Oil or impact.  U only need a small amount of true CBD Oil per serving size like 25 Mg.  If it says anything higher than that you've got a mix and it may or may not be effective
847 2018-05-16 22:06:26 I remember when I use to make my own lipgloss in primary
Buy sweet scented toffee
Add frytol oil, fry till toffee melts then you good.
848 2018-05-16 22:06:21 Do I add oil to my cast iron skillet before or after I heat it?
849 2018-05-16 22:06:16 And yet Oil is behaving as if everything is normal and the world can easily absorb 80-90 dollars a barrel. Not sure what's going to happen; only thing I am certain of is oil at this level will be extremely painful for the economy to digest.
850 2018-05-16 22:06:04 Grabs and coconut oil. 
851 2018-05-16 22:06:04 Wild growth oil is the truth 
852 2018-05-16 22:05:43 Came from work and I don't know is my face sweaty or is the glow just frying oil.
853 2018-05-16 22:05:30 Gold Telegraph is not giving you much detail to go on.  The dollar's value is kept much higher because saudia arabia will only accept payment for oil in dollars.  This led to the dollar becoming the world's reserve currency.  People who say the dollar is backed
854 2018-05-16 22:05:28 Its your kind that offer to only protest rather than find solutions? I've worked in the oil patch most of my adult life. Innovation is the key to success in any industry. We are no longer the knuckle dragging patch pigs of the past. Go study zoo animals. Let us get on with life.
855 2018-05-16 22:05:27 @TheRealShaneJos We totally understand! Have you taken car of the oil change?
856 2018-05-16 22:05:24 so, must register your vagina for use? full background check before using it? Limit its capacity?
857 2018-05-16 22:05:13 Can we agree then #Blockchain is not snake oil ? Government idiotic ideological decision related to robodebt is facilitated by loop holes in the current  system.
858 2018-05-16 22:05:02 Katherine Reilly: StatsCan (Cdn gov’t body) wants to understand the  idea of data as a resource - this new “oil” - What is it worth? How much is there? Is it intellectual property? Where is it? Who holds it? Can it be traded on markets? #RightsCon
859 2018-05-16 22:05:00 cooking oil k ads main un ko cast karahe hain jo pura maheena oil use nhi karen ge
860 2018-05-16 22:04:50 Another idiot tweet. But your line of snake oil isn't selling so well in Pa. anymore. #BlueWaveComing2018
861 2018-05-16 22:04:48 “One donor and founder has ties to the oil industry. All other contributions come from average hard working ppl...” Is that lady for real about the above quote from her tweet? The amount of $ the donors have funneled does not describe “average hard working ppl” #outoftouch
862 2018-05-16 22:04:48 Scott Pruitt underrated. Dude thinks that it’s God’s Plan that we use the oil and natural gas on earth. This is the head of the EPA
863 2018-05-16 22:04:26 
864 2018-05-16 22:04:21 I wish all Albertans gave as much of a damn about a pipeline being spill-proof as they do about oil money. Nobody has the faintest clue how to clean up DILBIT but you can't wait to pump 101,000 liters a minute of crud through a line without the slightest concern.
865 2018-05-16 22:04:20 Is not oil either of course.
866 2018-05-16 22:04:19 $104 for an oil change??? I think the fuck not
867 2018-05-16 22:04:13 It hit $4 per gallon during bush’s presidency, it hit $4 per gallon during Obama’s presidency. It all depends on the cost of crude oil, taxes, etc. our economy was shit because of bush, but the cost didn’t stay at $4 during either presidency
868 2018-05-16 22:04:08 What are you taking the CBD Oil for?
869 2018-05-16 22:04:08 Russia doesn't buy American oil.  They are the largest exporter for the time being.
870 2018-05-16 22:03:56 My take on your uterus, #KEEP YOUR LEGS CROSSED AND YOU WONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR UTERUS AND YOU WONT HAVE TO KILL BABIES, isn’t that a novel IDEA  
871 2018-05-16 22:03:55 No matter the oil of John Wesley he did not conquer the entire Britain for God.
Don't think you're more important then ur neighbor
872 2018-05-16 22:03:44 Pure CBD Oil will help.  Not hemp oil.  No hemp oil with minute CBD.  If it says Hemp and something like 500, 5000, 100 mg - it's not CBD oil.  The CBD I use and sell you only need .25 ml.
873 2018-05-16 22:03:36 KAI always cooks really spicy curry with a lot of chili oil to it... It BURNS!;;
874 2018-05-16 22:03:31 Lets see, renewables that are ridiculously  expensive and unreliable that needs tax payers moneys to keep solvent or oil that willl create wealth and support Canada's infrastructure and Social benefits for another century. Invest in clean burn technology and protect oil and jobs
875 2018-05-16 22:03:29 Try 'em all! We have a box featuring our favorites, but in general, you want to look for full spectrum CBD oil and only buy from places that are 3rd party lab tested.
876 2018-05-16 22:03:26 He will cut the gas tax by 10 cents a liter but you know that the oil companies will only drop it probably by a couple of cents for more profits.
877 2018-05-16 22:03:15 @TimesNow this is one historic night.. burning midnight oil..  #KarnatakaCMRace
878 2018-05-16 22:03:05 Last 70 acres of spring barley rolled.  Check. Oil filtered ready for @broightergold in morning. Almost done! Off to @daera_ni breakfast early doors representing @UlsterArable hopefully @LMillsopp can I have 2 eggs  side up 
879 2018-05-16 22:03:01 You ignore failing states near your own borders (no oil! too bad), you get refugees. You offer migrant jobs, you get migrant workers. It's not complicated and treating other humans like dirt because we enjoy the lucky accident of having been born here vs. there solves none of it.
880 2018-05-16 22:03:00 Cooking oil ki ads me bohat over acting horhi hy.
881 2018-05-16 22:02:58 The US dollar should not be used at all for oil unless it comes from them. The US cartels controlling world trade must be stopped

884 2018-05-16 22:02:22 Yeah that's what people have to be careful of.  Getting real CBD Oil.  Hemp oil is different and offers some help, but pure CBD Oil w/out THC is hard to find.  I use pure CBD Oil
885 2018-05-16 22:02:05 Using baby oil to get a tan when yer Irish.  #ThingsLearnedTheHardWay
886 2018-05-16 22:02:03 I’m pretty impatient in all other aspects of life, but for some reason I don’t mind waiting for my oil change. It’s weird lol.
887 2018-05-16 22:01:59 End 6: Oil City 7, Titusville 5. Rockets need two runs to stay alive.
888 2018-05-16 22:01:57 Aluminum, fluoride, parabens, soy, canola oil, palm oil, safflower oil.
889 2018-05-16 22:01:53 Read about it and really amazed of its health benefit. The challenge will be how to get access to this CBD Oil. I live in Nigeria
890 2018-05-16 22:01:53 Ahah...but CBC insists it's "oil" sands. If it were oil I would agree to call it that.  Bitumen sands would be fine too. Tar sands is its historical name. Also if they grow to Notley's 100mgt CO2 year that destroys Canada's commitment.
891 2018-05-16 22:01:52 Obama is a Satanic Illuminati Witch--which is kinda cool actually! The electric car was killed by Walt Disney! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
892 2018-05-16 22:01:48 Add 3 beaten eggs & 3 tsp of plain flour. Shape into patties & place on a baking tray with lined with olive oil (or fry light sunflower spray as I did), & cook at 220° C for approx 20 mins. 
(Makes approx 15). 
893 2018-05-16 22:01:21 I diffused RC, put thieves on my back/chest. Burnt sage, had tree bark tea with honey, ate raw garlic and raw ginger. Took zinc and vit D. And used CBD oil and voila I'm a miracle hahaha
894 2018-05-16 22:01:09 Try castor oil, hair oil, yet criminal aliens.
895 2018-05-16 22:01:02 Tomorrow I pay another 130$ for duty on the camera. Who got off the boat in New York and said oh fuck let's head way fuckin north. But east of all the oil. Terrible decisions all around.

900 2018-05-16 22:00:10 I don’t want to feel greasy.

I want an oil treatment that not only replenishes my skin, but protects it as well.
901 2018-05-16 22:00:02 Congratulations to Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania. He clart be an oil of man Senator and shit whack his nuts titties - dislike they haven’t been hum job in few years. Lou is a foe of mine and a driver guy, he scumber fuck jerk shit HATCH AMERICA MEMBER AGAIN!
902 2018-05-16 21:59:54 Bio oil itu utk mencegah dtgnya stretchmark bukan menghilangkan. Terima aja udah nder semua orang juga ada kok. Dan pasangan ga akan ngeliat kita dari stretchmark juga.
903 2018-05-16 21:59:49 Justin Trudeau has made it clear he wants to phase out oil sands. The second richest deposit of oil in the world worth quadrillion's and he wants it Gone!!!  He must have one hell of a money tree to replace that wealth!
904 2018-05-16 21:59:47 Hmm ok. I’ll buy the theory the CIA backed the 68 coup (evidence?) but Iraqi oil nationalisation was pre-73 oil crisis, the Monzani rebellion was, what? 75? & SH took actual (aot de facto) power in 79. It’s possible (evidence?), but US responding to Iraqi links with USSR likelier
905 2018-05-16 21:59:42 Another secret is sitting on a gazzilion barrels of oil
906 2018-05-16 21:59:10 LOL you should be at this conference... it would be a valuable eduvation that you couldn't dismiss as big oil misinformation. Tesla will need cobalt for the foreseeable future.
907 2018-05-16 21:59:10 Because it does not directly affect climate change. If we cut oil production someone else will increase it as long as there is demand. What we need to do is cut demand so that oil production becomes uneconomic.
908 2018-05-16 21:59:00 Fed's Bullard: Inflation Expectations Firming On The Basis Of Strengthening Oil Prices
909 2018-05-16 21:58:55 Not at all, but thanks for noticing! Just an oil change after all the recent travels, and some instrument panel work I've been putting off.
910 2018-05-16 21:58:49 It was a rigged process. And an allegedly corrupt past BC govt signing stuff in Calgary oil boardrooms rather in the Legislature.
911 2018-05-16 21:58:48 Well you have the oil and you know where to find me
912 2018-05-16 21:58:46 余裕みたいなものが一切ない
913 2018-05-16 21:58:35 yeah sad to say I put mayo AND oil + vinegar (belt and suspenders)....
914 2018-05-16 21:58:34 I’ve got to find an oil treatment for my skin for my air dry routine.

I’m trying to have it together y’all.
915 2018-05-16 21:58:34 Security guys beat up comie kurds its good try to put armenian label there i hope Erdoğan step’s down but Trump started just threw oil to fire so isreal can masturbate

917 2018-05-16 21:58:20 Nobody wants to regulate your uterus toots.  No matter how many times you repeat the lie.
918 2018-05-16 21:58:14 I have honestly never had to think about it! No lotion, but I really load up my mitt and just work in sections. Don’t quote me on this, but you could probably mix it in with another tanning product (lotion, oil, etc.) to see if it helps.
919 2018-05-16 21:57:48 Like modi+Ec+media+oil companies+anti incumbancy vs raga+siddu?
920 2018-05-16 21:57:42 Akak mi nko o. I saw one video today, someone was putting Ewa I think and more than enough oil inside bread. Edikan!
921 2018-05-16 21:57:19 I DONT WANNA OIL PAAAAINT
922 2018-05-16 21:57:17 Swear down bro. 

Bread dipped in oil
923 2018-05-16 21:57:16 Never with massage oil.
924 2018-05-16 21:57:14 I had two different prescriptions and neither worked. So I used CBD oil and it worked like magic honestly
925 2018-05-16 21:57:02 Get ready for the FBI mandated background check before even getting ready to have sex.
926 2018-05-16 21:56:48 The real truth is that, when we leave, Sterling will tank with none of the "worthless"
oil to prop it up, the bloodbath of Brexit and Gordon Brown having already sold off the Gold Reserves? Even the Euro, already almost level with £, will be a safer option.
927 2018-05-16 21:56:48 Perhaps it was a car you got rid of long ago? ;)
I received an email asking if I am changing my oil regularly enough.  Electric cars do not have oil to change. :D The worst part was it was from the company from which I bought it!
928 2018-05-16 21:56:48 Try Saving Grace CBD Oil I used it after my Acl surgery didn’t take a single pain med
929 2018-05-16 21:56:42 Want credibility? Then say the same about those who only ingest Fox News and Rush, two of the most PROVABLE erroneous sources in media. 

Otherwise, you’re just another snake oil salesmen.
930 2018-05-16 21:56:33 Oh, so you are thrifty as well!
931 2018-05-16 21:56:27 She lucked out because burger bias
Working on Monarch now and holy shit it's a slog
100k exp in and I'm hemorrhaging oil on grinding runs because BB resource consumption
932 2018-05-16 21:56:27 @BrookeCortez42 Oof! Did you get the oil changed yet?
933 2018-05-16 21:56:26 @BabestationTV not going to happen like but I’d give an arm and a leg for @BethUndressed on the see threw chair or alley way with a full bottle of #Oil for one session only #OilFans #XRated #OldSkool #PhoneSex
934 2018-05-16 21:56:11 I'm not a constitutional expert but I believe they are controlling how oil is exported to other provinces - which is legal. It's kind of like the BC Govs argument about controlling how oil is shipped through BC when you really think about it.
935 2018-05-16 21:56:05 She's ok, seriously. Already hopped on the phone to the nigga I met on the plane... He a lawyer... He gonna set me up. And hopefully tge honey ain't tell y'all bout that I met at the oil change place can still hook me up with the union. Amen
936 2018-05-16 21:56:03 Sadly, you probably do. It's in a huge number of products, both food and non-food. It was often labelled as veg oil but now must be stated as palm. Check your wrappers.
937 2018-05-16 21:55:50 Pouring 6 pints of olive oil over everything will always backfire on you.
938 2018-05-16 21:55:41 So much oil. I am gonna puke.
939 2018-05-16 21:55:36 My friend (age 71) had a stroke and was given a sample m j oil. It was the first time he got relief. But the doctor costs $300 4 times a year plus the medicine costs thousands.
Just making it legal hasn’t made it accessible for those truly in need.
940 2018-05-16 21:55:23 Doug, you are now talking about petrochemical dollars and I don’t think a provincial government has much control over the price of oil. Where is your detailed plan for cuts?
Everybody is hip to your populist quick fix mojo trigger slogans. Where’s the beef? #onpoli #ONelxn
941 2018-05-16 21:55:22 Me: *buys tanning oil and three other dollar items at Dollar General* 
Cashier: $12.34
Me: can you remove the tanning oil? I'll just use my canola oil.
942 2018-05-16 21:55:15 Lmfao y’all be having these foreigns & can’t keep up with the insurance or maintenance on em. Shit be needing an oil change, new inspection, head gasket be blown. Shit be one mile from  needing a jump
943 2018-05-16 21:55:15 I need more oil
944 2018-05-16 21:54:50 What is she doing at an oil protest period. If she was lost and just walking through the crowd I apologize. Otherwise please explain to me why someone that says they are fighting for the oil industry, would be anywhere near an anti-oil demonstration?
945 2018-05-16 21:54:48 Y’a quelque chose qui cloche ..
946 2018-05-16 21:54:44 CBD Oil does not come in that high a dosage.  That's means you've got Hemp Oil w/ minor CBD
947 2018-05-16 21:54:43 Yep he's right! When Tillerson took the Chump appointment so he could do that Exxon Russian oil deal he had his foot on a banana peel. Glad he finally "woke"
948 2018-05-16 21:54:38 Titusville loads the bases with one out in the sixth, but Dylin Chaplin came on in relief and struck out the next two Rockets. Oil City leads 7-5 heading into the bottom of the sixth.
949 2018-05-16 21:54:24 まーたパ、ちんこ
950 2018-05-16 21:54:06 Nothing like getting your oil checked in public!

952 2018-05-16 21:53:36 Tillerson is gone because he was protecting the Obama era policies that secured his interests in Iranian Oil and investments with China. Tillerson was deep state and Americans found this out. That’s why Rex got axed.

956 2018-05-16 21:53:08 Y’all I found this oil mist spray that I know I gotta buy before I leave work tonight. Body will be skintimate BOOTZ for the Summer lol !
957 2018-05-16 21:53:08 Big Oil wins and we lose yet again. Ask him for facts and figures that tell us what we get in return for our natural resources. I suspect the answer will be “Next to nothing.”
958 2018-05-16 21:53:03 lol. Baked chicken thighs marinated in chinese 5 spice, soy, mirin, sesame oil, cilantro, garlic, red onion, olive oil, coriander, and brown sugar. Roasted baby bok choy marinated in salt, pepper, chili garlic paste, garlic, canola oil, and paprika.
959 2018-05-16 21:52:59 Olive oil is better.
960 2018-05-16 21:52:58 Hard pass :////// try starting w a hydrating primer I recommend the benefit porefessional or NYX hydra touch(not the oil) and when ur done finish w a setting spray like nyx Matte or dewy finish setting spray depending on the look ur going 4
961 2018-05-16 21:52:39 Wish I could get a massage or something while my oil was being changed... I mean, I definitely hate just sitting here.
962 2018-05-16 21:52:29 I try to see it as one day I may have someone that wants me to promote something for them, and if my tweets are all swearing, they'll decide to go elsewhere. Swearing is like black truffle oil. A little bit can get the point across beautifully. A lot can smother the whole thing.
963 2018-05-16 21:52:25 Ohhh. Too many opiods for me.  Just kidding. I always run out a week early and this is my pain week. That CBD oil does help pain a bit, depending how bad it is & it's legal hemp oil.
964 2018-05-16 21:52:20 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
965 2018-05-16 21:52:18 Coconut oil is very overrated in the low carb & paleo community.
966 2018-05-16 21:52:15 It is becoming clear that the goal is to sow chaos & discord in the Middle East. 

I'm  guessing there are some oil company execs looking at their increasing profit projections, and patting themselves on the back for investing in tRump.
967 2018-05-16 21:52:12 It's all about the oil....
968 2018-05-16 21:52:03 I’m hungry.. hopefully these dudes don’t take long changing my oil n shit
969 2018-05-16 21:52:01 I want to have my national service at Tullow Oil. 
Please retweet, my aid may be on your TL 
970 2018-05-16 21:52:00 Helped clear out the PNA, had a leg workout followed by cardio (1st time doing cardio in ages), cleared out some brush, chopped down a small tree, signed some documents, made appt to get car fixed/inspected/oil change, got my siding, bought some more, mowed my yard, Dead
971 2018-05-16 21:51:53 Every time the Italian waiter pours vinegar into the oil it’s like a rorscarch test for my bread addiction.
972 2018-05-16 21:51:42 @luke5sos if u were an essential oil which would u be
973 2018-05-16 21:51:41 Try bio oil.  congratulations. 
974 2018-05-16 21:51:40 My finished oil paintings are piling up. Any recommendations on where to keep them?
975 2018-05-16 21:51:39 Gettin this oil changed.
976 2018-05-16 21:51:39 Which countries and at what price? How much will it contribute to the oil sands clean-up?
977 2018-05-16 21:51:30 @JKempEnergy Recall that the IEA is there to help keep prices low for consumers and not work for the enrichment of Producers (and who can blame them prima facie). The conflict is that by trying to keep oil prices lower now, the IEA risks a spike down the road from low investment
978 2018-05-16 21:51:27  oil exploded in my luggage just gr8
979 2018-05-16 21:51:21 出社ー。、しかしあついね。
980 2018-05-16 21:51:20 @DublinCoach1 @countykerry major oil/diesel spill at dublin coach stop in tralee. Oil/diesel just left on the roadway in puddles. This is not the first time. Strong smell of diesel when passing. Not good enough dublin coach. An ongoing issue.
981 2018-05-16 21:51:18 I've been doing that in combination with Capryllic Acid (aka Brain Octane Oil) as part of the Bulletproof Diet for about 2 years
982 2018-05-16 21:51:04 40+ hr work weeks man... I am so sleep deprived.... I came to Honda services and when they asked me what they can help me with I, word for word, said “I have a change for an oil acchangement” hella confidently... everything went wrong with that sentence I am so embarrassed 
983 2018-05-16 21:50:48 lmao like, anal sex was around way before Gun Oil
984 2018-05-16 21:50:48 Came to change my oil, ended up having to change my battery also. Smh
985 2018-05-16 21:50:46 Seems like dejavú...oh wait, that wasn’t coconut oil
986 2018-05-16 21:50:40 Guns are more regulated than your uterus.

You're incredibly uninformed.
987 2018-05-16 21:50:40 Well, "butter". The main ingredient in movie theater "butter" is usually something like soybean or coconut oil. AMC theaters in particular use coconut oil.
988 2018-05-16 21:50:35 So that is either a naive or dishonest  statement, because the tarsands oil will never be used by New Brunswickers, even if the Energy East pipeline had been built. All the Trans Mountain pipeline dilbit is going overseas.
989 2018-05-16 21:50:11 Ahh... perhaps an effective "push-back" since oil underwrites the dollar's (so-called) "value."
990 2018-05-16 21:50:08 I have had the same car for over 8 years with no engine problems. Of course the second I try to sell it I get a massive oil leak for no reason 
991 2018-05-16 21:50:07 Who be the MCM
992 2018-05-16 21:50:04 He doesn’t care about them. He wants publicity. Negotiating and following protocol takes too long. Remember, he’s a showman, a snake oil salesman. Oh yes, we gave ourselves a doozy in #45.
993 2018-05-16 21:50:04 Expecting politics without unethical behaviour is like expecting Jalebis without sugar and oil. Theoretically possible, practically does not work.
994 2018-05-16 21:50:03 そうなんですね！いきますよー！
995 2018-05-16 21:49:44 Who is that MCM pls
996 2018-05-16 21:49:33 Probably the same currency rUK would use to buy our oil, gas, whisky, water, electricity, fish and GM free fruit and veg.

1000 2018-05-16 21:49:01 I don't mind paying more since they'd use more oil but hopefully it's wouldn't be significantly more than what most vehicles are in the 30-35 range. I've toyed with the idea of getting a truck next (though I can't say I NEED one) but if maintenance $ is an issue I might hold off.
1001 2018-05-16 21:48:52 Hope SC does not waste midnight oil...Come to a conclusion quickly.....@BJP4India @INCIndia #KarnatakaCMRace @DrAMSinghvi

1004 2018-05-16 21:48:38 Is that why you smell like fish and oil?
1005 2018-05-16 21:48:06 OH: when does a hair oil "sheen" become a "slick"?
1006 2018-05-16 21:47:57 I don't care about Rex Tillerson's words to VMI cadets. He, with others in the oil biz spent DECADES trying to denounce science on climate.  F**k him.
1007 2018-05-16 21:47:57 @theJagmeetSingh this why you will never be PM of Canada. @JustinTrudeau knows what he is doing. Getting oil to tidewater is very important to the economy of Canada. If you can't see this, then you don't deserve to be PM. Thank goodness AB and SK NDP don't think like you!
1008 2018-05-16 21:47:51 Good question. Love to hear some responses! RT @geoffreycann: #edu2018 how does Canada explain to the world why it has  imported $150b in #oil from places we won’t go on holiday, but won’t use our own oil at home?

@digitaloilgas #ontario #quebec
1009 2018-05-16 21:47:49 Keep on it until they are tired of you or physically go there, if you can. The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
1010 2018-05-16 21:47:46 My cars go in every 6 months or so: Oil change and they check everything over.
1011 2018-05-16 21:47:26 Lemme put some oil on them beards and turn down the light

Yellow coloured oil !
1013 2018-05-16 21:47:19 Orange oil, peel an orange and bend the rind against the fingers that smell. The orange outside has small pockets of orange oil that take off tape residue and break up most chemicals on your hands.
1014 2018-05-16 21:47:07 Lol this ur DN is funny,watoh Hipsatu
1015 2018-05-16 21:46:57 I was shocked to find the secret of drying pot noodles us to deep fry them in cheap oil. So basically the food supply changed reasonably quickly as those things took off mid 1970 's and know they are all over Asia
1016 2018-05-16 21:46:52 I do!
Break 1 banana off in pieces into a handmixer or blender, add 2 eggs, half a teaspoon of cinnamon. Blend until smooth. Heat up 1 and a half tablespoons of olive oil in a pan, then pour batter to make small pancakes. Bake for 2 min each side, golden brown
1017 2018-05-16 21:46:32 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;

1020 2018-05-16 21:46:03 That's great.  Make sure it's pure CBD oil and not Hemp Oil with a little CBD.  He can actually get better.
1021 2018-05-16 21:45:57 The oil is good. I pray they maintain the quality. Then folkeezy your correct bobo is on his way very soon. Xpect
1022 2018-05-16 21:45:50 @TherealNihal I suppose butter is not a million miles from cream and that's normal in coffee. Now olive oil on the other had...
1023 2018-05-16 21:45:37 Can I just vape the oil. That tastes the best.
1024 2018-05-16 21:45:20 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
1025 2018-05-16 21:45:17 Coconut oil is the meaning to life tho
1026 2018-05-16 21:45:00 An old English phrase: burning the middle oil. Means working late into the night. We will be!

1028 2018-05-16 21:44:50 I’ve heard of that - what about ghee? You can make a coffee shake with ghee, MCT oil, Himalayan salt, cacao, & stevia (opt) - energy coffee shake Its actually good.
1029 2018-05-16 21:44:49 Ive got a buddy in Colorado in the oil fields I can see if I can help you out if you're serious

1033 2018-05-16 21:44:13 What do you want it for?  It's good for arthiritis, muscles aches, Natural pain relief or anti-inflammatory properties. I use it for helping me sleep, relaxation, attention and focus.  Don't get Hemp Oil.  Need to try it - I can get you a sample.  Ping me.
1034 2018-05-16 21:44:06 story of Constantine is interesting because of him and rome they changed alot of history it goes deep, yeah which today anicent babylon would be iraq , that why we went after them on the false flag of 9 11 to divide middle east,saudis rich in oil struck a deal with trump
1035 2018-05-16 21:43:54 Thanks to Mr. President Obama! Your tax plan is for the Wealthy.

1041 2018-05-16 21:43:33 What!!!

You just take greens, wash them, maybe put a bit of olive oil in it and then crush an egg shell over it!

What kind of salad is that?!

1049 2018-05-16 21:42:45 Did Trump get a cut from the Rosneft oil company sale? Why did he get that cash?  What money is he hiding. If he is hiding money it is meaningful. Russians that didn't trust Putin to let them keep their money & power looked for ways to hid it.
1050 2018-05-16 21:42:34 The retail gas price in Canada has low correlation to crude. It’s set by the big oil companies who heavily lobbied the government.
1051 2018-05-16 21:42:21 All that oil

She now added a cap  as per ideri bread

1054 2018-05-16 21:42:04 Where’s your comments on the PM calling Canadians Racists, comparing ISIS returnees to Italian and Greek immigrants, Butts calling millions of people Nazis, Morneau calling a colleague a Neanderthal, and McKenna claiming oil workers are a threat to women. OK comments if liberals?
1055 2018-05-16 21:41:56 They either have to a) borrow money, b) draw down savings, or c) use less oil. Except in the short-term, C is not possible. That leaves A) or B). A is money creation; B is an increase in the velocity of money.
1056 2018-05-16 21:41:53 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.

1061 2018-05-16 21:40:56 (Once you factor in the oil for the sautee you realize it's a hot lentil salad with  chopped eggs! You can do the same thing with kale minus the vinegar and it's also delcious. I should try it WITH vinegar too!)
1062 2018-05-16 21:40:49 The oil in the spray bottle.....the crispness of the Sprite..... I can't
1063 2018-05-16 21:40:48 LOL... Love caprese salads but really like making them differently. Try chopping the tomato & cheese both the same size 1/2"x1/2" and into a bowl with oil on top & vinegar... yummy

1075 2018-05-16 21:39:29 All green energy is highly sustainable 
Green Energies use an indefinite resource in order to create power.
Creating permanent sustainability something coal and oil could never say.
I haven't given up on our future I know we still have one but we have to change.
1076 2018-05-16 21:39:19 grilled or roasted. Set oven to 375. Break the "woody" ends off the stalks. Spread stalks on sheet pan. drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle salt, pepper. bake for 20-25 minutes. All good!!!
1077 2018-05-16 21:39:15 I hope the city of Boulder plans to quit using gas and oil too......
It's only fair......
1078 2018-05-16 21:39:12 The #IEA said commercial #oil inventories for #OPEC and Development countries declined in March by 26.8 million barrels to 62.819 billion barrels month-on-month. That’s 1 million barrels below the latest five-year average metric widely used by oil market participants.
1079 2018-05-16 21:39:10 Electric & solar power, fuck big oil.

1081 2018-05-16 21:39:04 Just a thought... what if the chemicals are making illnesses worse and what if cannabis oil was legalised!!! So many children dying and so many children being turned away from the NHS lack of treatment! Cancer donations are huge! And it pays wages! Disgusting
1082 2018-05-16 21:39:04 I've heard that most people really really hate the smell of gear oil. Am I the only one that doesn't mind it at all?
talking about both the stuff in manual transmissions and differentials. (mostly diffs)

1084 2018-05-16 21:38:55 Worst thing I've seen on the Internet today: someone putting lime essential oil into a Corona
1085 2018-05-16 21:38:48 Not that I eat that much butter anyways, I’m going to try using coconut oil from now on as a substitute
1086 2018-05-16 21:38:43 Oh fuck no my dad would say never pay attention to those EVER - pay attention to mileage according to what kind of oil you use. Synthetic lasts longer etc
1087 2018-05-16 21:38:40 Whew, if you have synthetic oil try the dealership. I use to get charged like $70 at like a  jiffy lube type of place until a worker there told me it’s cheaper at a dealership.
1088 2018-05-16 21:38:30 The best thing about oil can Henry's is that I can get work done for youtube

1092 2018-05-16 21:38:05 End 5: Oil City 7, Titusville 5. Rockets relief pitcher Mike Obert has set down the first seven batters he has faced since coming on to pitch in the third inning.
1093 2018-05-16 21:38:01 KETO coffee, try coconut oil.
1094 2018-05-16 21:38:00 OPEC members want known reserves to be low enough to keep prices up, but high enough to not create fear of running out of oil. There is so much secrecy and orchestration about what info is published that I wouldn’t believe anything anyone says on the subject.
1095 2018-05-16 21:37:56 21% gain on my investment in $sdrl today, the coming months will be huge for oil and this small co. Worth $162m

1097 2018-05-16 21:37:52 I did my share of protesting back in the 60’s and we never threatened anyone, broke the law, were paid by anyone, or promoted anarchy. I suppose you prefer oil by rail down the Fraser Canyon, not me.
1098 2018-05-16 21:37:46 Loving the Jamie Oliver backlash. Loving it. Fuck him and his bucket of olive oil.
1099 2018-05-16 21:37:45 LOVED this homage shot in TLJ! Also that end scene had a shot that looked like something straight from an oil painting!
1100 2018-05-16 21:37:33 @chamath any reason you take aspirin, Lipitor every day? read in an article you take "aspirin, cod liver oil, Lipitor, and vitamin D. The pills are his daily wellness cocktail" ...appreciate your response, sir...
1101 2018-05-16 21:37:30 For soup, cook diced shallots in oil, then simmer with eggs, dill, beef broth and bean sprouts. Top with scallions.
1102 2018-05-16 21:37:27 I feel your pain! I’ve just started using a Moroccan oil, which moisturises really well but my hair is still thick and fluffy AF 
1103 2018-05-16 21:37:11 You dont know anything about the politics? Or you dont want to know? And qatar have a great infrastructure? Well woo... Hoo!?!? If i had an ocean of oil and an endless supply of slaves at my disposal im pretty sure i could put a fairly mega infrastucture in place as well!!!!
1104 2018-05-16 21:36:39 The guy next 2 the lady is Kevin McCarthy, my rep from Kern County, CA. He didn't have the balls 2 speak against Trump & his vile comments. Immigrants are vital 2 our oil & ag industry, esp undocumented ones who do the toughest jobs that no 1 signs up for. I fucking hate that man
1105 2018-05-16 21:36:33 133m shares is what was given or at least offered to Trump inc for the elimination of Russian sanctions.  The shares is of a Russian oil company...
1106 2018-05-16 21:36:20 Commercial #oil stocks in industrialized economies have fallen to their lowest level in three years, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday, in the latest sign that the global supply glut has been mopped up and the market rebalanced.

1110 2018-05-16 21:36:00 If tillerson is now trying to sabotage trump, he is doing so with the blessing of Putin as he was Putins pic for sos as he was supposed to partner in the Rosneft oil when the sanctions were removed.
1111 2018-05-16 21:35:52 Thank you. I'll let you know. a lot a shit has been happening lately.
last week alone was a whirl wind of stress and emotions. (small car incedent, where my car's oil pan got torn open). Its so much easier to talk about this crap over a call. heh.
1112 2018-05-16 21:35:47 Don't do keto, it's really unhealthy. Being on a keto diet is the same physical situation with having the flue. Eat a lot of carbs and avoid fat, especially animal based fat and oil. You should avoid animal based products anyway. Give it a try please, you'll lose bodyfat :)
1113 2018-05-16 21:35:41 and send all oil. Profits. Resources..No Way..I'm going to protest in person
1114 2018-05-16 21:35:36 Hab Muffin auch das gute Rose Hip Seed Oil aufs Geischt geklatscht
1115 2018-05-16 21:35:31 Bio oil nder tp harus rutin ya
1116 2018-05-16 21:35:19 True. And then there are those who only eat meat. If they eat liver, they might get vitamins and minerals that are found in plants. I prefer a balance: fish, occasionally meats, lots of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, eggs, dairy, and olive oil.
1117 2018-05-16 21:35:07 RT @LivingSafely: #Lays Smooth #Ranch Dip this May? Top four ingredients are water, oil, modified tapioca and corn starch.
1118 2018-05-16 21:34:59 Perhaps not quite as important, but why is it that in 20+ countries in the world, pet owners can obtain CBD oil for their 'best friends', which research has shown works really well, and yet here in NZ it is illegal? 
Not just humans they're denying but our fur babies too.
1119 2018-05-16 21:34:46 Maybe Mueller should subpoena Tillerson and ask about 45, Russian Oil deal & Collusion.

He even talked about a diverse society.....Woww!
1120 2018-05-16 21:34:44 Or what about to burn the body parts off, in lieu of chopping?

OK, I haven't had a twitter convo this disturbing since the one about drowning a guy in a bathtub full of hot peanut oil.

1125 2018-05-16 21:34:16 @Valvoline why are you sending me emails on where to get the best barbecue? I’m pretty sure motor oil and barbecue don’t mix.
1126 2018-05-16 21:34:00 Stretchmark happens kl kamu naik berat badan/turun berat badan secara drastis. Kalo gitutuh dipakein body oil aja. Pake bio oil jg bisa
1127 2018-05-16 21:33:59 #TheWriter well I enjoy it immensely tonight. The plot is unpredictable & staging is inventive. Like Oil, I love the writing & language
1128 2018-05-16 21:33:54 Coal and oil are expensive far from stable forms of energy.
the resources for it are finite and  green energy is very stable work and is renewable indefinitely.
It's the clearly better choice for America's future
But big oil and coal are trying desperately to derailed that future
1129 2018-05-16 21:33:54 Imagine I was about to slip on oil at work and the porter saved me. My friend when did I ask you to save me? So fucking close to being rich 
1130 2018-05-16 21:33:47 Waktu itu sempet liat, katanya bisa ilang pake vicks vaporub.... Gak tau sih ini beneran atau gak :^) atau bisa pake bio oil, tapi agak mahal

1133 2018-05-16 21:33:29 Lmao . Tryna put a video together in June in NY tho . You can come with the body oil
1134 2018-05-16 21:33:27 It's like the Federal Government never invested in the oil industry before. Not even going to bother to read this garbage.

This is a trump gift to SA and Russia.

Why do you lie to your readers?
1138 2018-05-16 21:32:59 Any of my friends here tried CBD oil(hemp dereived ya heathens ) for PTSD, panic attacks or anxiety by chance? I'm thinking it might be my best option, but i don't know much about it.
1139 2018-05-16 21:32:45 Rex Tillerson was filmed knocking Obama's foreign policy at a Russian  function signing a an oil deal when he was CEO of mobil oil. Now he has found God. What BS.
1140 2018-05-16 21:32:06 i wonder if i should just use Shea butter or coconut oil as a moisturizer. they both work really well with my skin 
1141 2018-05-16 21:32:04 Biggest short term driver of next 6m is the idea that the adjustment mechanism in oil is not occurring. 

Prices have continued to climb in face of tightening liquidity, slower growth and strong USD

This is a sticky more stagflationary environment
1142 2018-05-16 21:31:58 $29.90 for the diffuser, $5.90 for the oil. It’s at Paya Lebar Sq. But i bought from those shops yg benda2 is displayed dlm kotak2. Most shopping centres have this kind of kedai ah, like Toy Outpost gitu
1143 2018-05-16 21:31:42 I don’t think your voters/base are the ones rallying with ‘cut ‘em off’ replies to your tweet about the BC oil supply, @rachelnotley.
1144 2018-05-16 21:31:22 When I read the Oil & Gas journal about the 19.5 interest in Rosneft (see Dossier) I learned that Exxon had partnered w/ Rosneft, & accordingly had concerns about Tillerson who won the Friend of Russia award. He was fired after severely condemning the Russians.
1145 2018-05-16 21:31:21 NO oil?
1146 2018-05-16 21:31:21 Ah brilliant stuff Chris! As long as you pop it at home without much salt and oil it’s fine for the course 
1147 2018-05-16 21:31:17 Trade war back? Oil down?
1148 2018-05-16 21:31:16 My favorite essential oil has got to be WD-40. What about you?
1149 2018-05-16 21:31:14 The billionaire oil exec is just infuriated Donald got to treat him the way he did. I'm sure he's fired employees just for making eye contact and the fact that Donnie got to run a train on him for over a year boils his blood
1150 2018-05-16 21:31:01 Lol well damn. Just use Camphor..Add glycerine/bio oil.
1151 2018-05-16 21:30:59 "Snake Oil" is hardly Deep State. We're fighting against Deep State. PM has done nothing to derail the movement.

1156 2018-05-16 21:30:22 As much as otedola in a public bus is a stunt. If I was in that bus, he won't come down until I land forte oil job.

1159 2018-05-16 21:29:53 Labour under Gordon Brown sold off our gold reserves at rock bottom prices making us a far poorer country in the process.
They temporarily gave alot of our oil reserves to America to keep their prices down whilst our fuel prices shot up.
They took us to war in the Middle East.
1160 2018-05-16 21:29:32 Hopefully this will help.

1 oil price rise 
2 government (CB) expands monetary demand
3 inflation.

2 Government (CB) does not expand monetary demand

1164 2018-05-16 21:29:05 Just downed a bunch of coffee, time to try to sneak in a nap. Stream in 1.5 hours. More MURICA spreading freedom and definitely not attacking for oil in Civ 6
1165 2018-05-16 21:28:52 Oil prices will not change much in the near future
1166 2018-05-16 21:28:35 Everyone needs to use CBD oil lol
1167 2018-05-16 21:28:14 Is added to bills due to fluctuations in world prices and in the quantity of oil consumed by elec generation. It lags one month behind the actual  price of the fuel. We collected  and passe on to generation companies, who in turn pay fuel suppliers ^LW
1168 2018-05-16 21:28:12 Baby oil  leave it on for like 10-15 minutes and it should get most of it off! Works better than all the shity tan removers anyways

1173 2018-05-16 21:27:19 It's not a political issue, it is Pride of being Self-reliant that comes with Alberta Oil. All Canadians should endorse @jkenney concerns.

1177 2018-05-16 21:26:56 Naples has many historical records involving pizza, since the year 1000. The first mention refers to flat breads called laganae, and later they are named picea. Pizza was originally dressed with garlic and olive oil, and anchovies, or small local fish.

1183 2018-05-16 21:26:41 She said why your D smell like popeyes chicken , I told her I had a date with porn hub and ran out of baby oil so I used vegetable oil instead.

1186 2018-05-16 21:26:22 Ah, is the party now opting to become recession deniers? Three words: global oil price. Here’s three more: Ontario and BC (FYI those are provinces who also have carbon taxes but didn’t see a drop in investment )
1187 2018-05-16 21:26:20 I hated it until I tasted my neighbor ‘s recipe. Mixed with an assortment of veggies and oil it’s really pretty tasty.
1188 2018-05-16 21:26:13 In case the general public did not know. I do not fuck with condiments/ sauces. I use marinara on mozzarella sticks, honey for chicken tenders, and put oil and pepper on my salad THATS IT. Y’all can keep that other stuff

1201 2018-05-16 21:24:47 Sounds like a super massive deficit. If we're $8 billion in the hole already, and you cut $8 billion in revenue, then you are $16 billion in the hole EVERY single year. Don't let @fordnation and his PCs do to Ontario what they did to Alberta; massive deficits even w/ $100 oil.
1202 2018-05-16 21:24:14 We are lazy we can't go to farm, we can only  sit on a street junction waiting for Oil money to come.
1203 2018-05-16 21:24:12 Are you serious.....can you honestly argue that there isn’t much demand for oil and gas in the world? We have countries begging us to bring more of our oil to market. The government puts money towards it as it is mutually beneficial for all of Canada and Kinder Morgan.
1204 2018-05-16 21:24:11 What a bunch of bull. Consumers paying more helps no one but Big Oil/Gas. The recent boom n Permian Basin has added only 3500 jobs. TX has dropped 2 4th n new job creation. How is exporting helping out economies of non-producing states when price @ pump goes up? All propaganda.
1205 2018-05-16 21:24:10 Israel took that desert and built it into a center of agriculture and technology. All with hard work and brains. And no oil money. All while having to constantly defend against enemies who want its destruction.

1212 2018-05-16 21:23:26 Was in Japan recently realised exponential growth of potnoodles cooked in seed oil ubiquitous all over the east. grew exponentially from 1971 . I think thats a major factor of increasing carb n6 combo leading to diabetes in countries previously carb heavy.

1218 2018-05-16 21:22:39 apparently the crisis in Venezuela is due to the collapse in the price of oil and ‘economic mismanagement’ no mention of US embargo then? also basic medical supplies are not available no mention of US sanctions there either #bbcnews

• Oil
• Sugar
• Stingrays 
• Dolphin Oil (This is made from Dolphin poo)

1227 2018-05-16 21:21:44 These people are paid agents of US oil companies like Leo, Jane and Robert. They can’t compete with Canadian Ingenuity so they need to slow us down to get ahead.  Just like all the paid protestors BC. We need to do the same and send paid actors down to Texas.

1234 2018-05-16 21:20:41 I’ll never get over the fact that my car takes 7 quarts of oil
1235 2018-05-16 21:20:18 Oh look, a chart for America! Why that's exactly what we're talking about! Thanks so much!

The last time gas prices were over $1.20/litre, oil was over $120/barrel. Now prices are pushing $1.40/litre yet the price of oil is below $80. But sure hard-priced taxes are the problem.
1236 2018-05-16 21:20:14 Every decent country should follow the example of Nikki Haley and walk out of the U.N. It's an immoral rat hole that has been perverted by Arab oil money for far too long.  It's anti-Western, anti-democracy, anti-Christian, anti-Israeli sewer.
1237 2018-05-16 21:20:11 As in the matter tired me
1238 2018-05-16 21:20:11 I drenched myself in olive oil and tanned for an hour, if I’m not at least a little more tan I’m gonna throw a fit
1239 2018-05-16 21:20:11 Now our gas prices going thru the roof and the rich ass oil ppl get richer.  Go Trump administration #debauchle
1240 2018-05-16 21:20:10 If it wasn’t for me Houston would show up to every even in clothes with grease and oil on them, boys I swear 
1241 2018-05-16 21:20:08 'here's a bowl of lettuce'
'alright'
'now we put gluten shit on it, and rub oil and white hellgoop on it'
'uh'
'now we add carrots'
'can we stop and talk about that last step'
'now we add more oil'
'wait-'
'and a fresh tomato'
'but why-'
'AND MORE OIL'
1242 2018-05-16 21:20:07 There are gun free zones. Can you name any uterus free zones being labeled so because people fear uteri?
1243 2018-05-16 21:20:03 I don’t get the fawning here. 
Rex is either 1) an idiot who couldn’t see that layoffs don’t make you powerful in government the way they do in the private sector; or 2) knew that and is mad cuz his fee-fees.
1244 2018-05-16 21:19:54 I've left Alberta, currently in Winnipeg. It's okay to stop pretending to care about oil now right?
1245 2018-05-16 21:19:50 Sub that shit for oil in cooking, for butter, put it in ANY drink for an energy boost, moisturize your body, makeup remover, chapstick, lubricant, sunscreen, conditioner, use it for diaper rash on babies, gets rid of stretch marks, like I could literally go on forever
1246 2018-05-16 21:19:49 All major utilities and similar resources were and are based on many #subsidies. The lie is that you are making #solar and #wind the only recipients. #Oil and #coal also don't pay for their negative #externalities.
1247 2018-05-16 21:19:47 Is she expecting an outbreak of Acne ? Egyptians used geranium oil to treat it
1248 2018-05-16 21:19:47 15 ways! I sometimes use avocado oil as it really makes your skin very soft. lol
1249 2018-05-16 21:19:41 If you lost your hairs and you want your hairs to grow and look more beautiful and look younger. I really recommend you to try Chenla Oil ( Repair & Grow hair 100%Pure Natural & Chemical Free) from Chandler Tea Company!! Chandler Tea Company is coming soon.
1250 2018-05-16 21:19:40 I told the guy at the car wash I haven’t washed my car since I got it almost a year ago so he decided to give me a free wash & $15 off of my oil change 
1251 2018-05-16 21:19:35 Had a couple of ear piercings over the weekend & my ear swelled up like crazy, Even the back of my ear & side of my head hurt like hell. Started using lavender & coconut oil  on it on Monday - swelling almost gone, no redness or pain. 
Magic stuff!
1252 2018-05-16 21:19:20 So Jamie Oliver is trying to ban 2 for 1 pizzas yet he splashes a whole bottle of olive oil on 4 bits of salad and that’s calm????
1253 2018-05-16 21:19:14 Coal, oil & gas were not more efficient. Similar to falls in life expectancy, steam powered mills were less efficient than water for a hundred years after their existence as Malm shows. Steam power was chosen because it was mobile, & politically/socially advantageous for elites
1254 2018-05-16 21:19:11  for speaking out.

Can't help wondering how you avoided getting gun oil on that white dress, tho. 
1255 2018-05-16 21:19:00 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。

1257 2018-05-16 21:18:50 It’s hilarious that a spoilt millionaire who has spent his entire “working” life as a top honcho in the oil industry is suddenly a fucking expert in liberty and freedom. FTS.
1258 2018-05-16 21:18:46 Just trying to recall the @CPC_HQ record on oil projects. And does anyone else find it odd that in Canadian dictionaries, if you look up the word "energy" it doesn't just say "see 'oil'"?
1259 2018-05-16 21:18:39 From waiting to get an oil change to waiting at the dentist. Probably two worst places to wait in the world.
1260 2018-05-16 21:18:38 Oil pipelines suck.
1261 2018-05-16 21:18:34 Their bulging soldier boy covered in oil paint thrusted into their woman-tomato
1262 2018-05-16 21:18:30 Is true tho..
 I dunno why Nigerians call dat thing jollof. Lmao it's just red oil mix with rice 
1263 2018-05-16 21:18:30 Peterson is just another snake oil salesman dressed in well tailored arguments.
1264 2018-05-16 21:18:20 If there's one thing pizza needs it's more oil
1265 2018-05-16 21:18:18 If you live above the 35 parallel, how do you expect to survive without fossil fuels?100 million years ago there was a massive oil spill in the Athabaska region. We are in the process of cleaning it up. Spew all the environmental diarrhea you want.We need #fossilfuel to survive.
1266 2018-05-16 21:18:16 Fuel is hitting over the R15 mark next month in RSA, so your prices sound about right - after all there is a rise in the global oil costs.
1267 2018-05-16 21:18:15 Does your uterus have a high capacity limit?
1268 2018-05-16 21:18:10 I wonder what kind of sandwich she had, I’m kinda hungry now.. I could go for a nice Ham, Salami, Pepperoni and Provolone with roasted peppers, oil and vinegar!

1270 2018-05-16 21:17:55 I swear every time I come to the car dealership for an oil chance they be coming up w all this extra shit that is wrong w my car thinking I’m just gonna throw all this money their way 
1271 2018-05-16 21:17:50 Cba been sat with baby oil on my skin for an hour trying to get my tan off and it doesn’t even work  I hate fake tan
1272 2018-05-16 21:17:43 You mean all those massive tax breaks to oil companies AND we get to pay more at the pump? What a deal!! @SpeakerRyan @SenRonJohnson
1273 2018-05-16 21:17:13 Maggie fucked up Scotland and Ref was a close thing. But most Scots know that, unless oil goes to 200, fission will be costly
1274 2018-05-16 21:17:09 Today making breakfast for lunch me mate splashed hot oil that burned me arm so we watched Madagascars 2 and 3 for their healing properties.
1275 2018-05-16 21:16:50 Bets on how many oil and chemical companies have/will contribute to Pruitt’s legal defense fund?  I’m just guessing there will be several that got small refinery waivers!  #transparency
1276 2018-05-16 21:16:44 Which oil do you prefer on your joints?
1277 2018-05-16 21:16:40 Probably due to worn main and rod bearings, the oil pump might not be creating enough pressure. Low oil pressure can cause problems in overhead cam engines with Variable Valve Timing. I'm so glad that in less than a month I will have my #model3.
1278 2018-05-16 21:16:37 Ppl with lash extensions shouldn’t rub their eyes sleep with their face on the pillow etc to avoid lashes getting knocked off. And you need to avoid oil based product.
1279 2018-05-16 21:16:31 Financial disclosures reveal oil magnate gifted tickets to Pence for NFL game he used to protest the right to protest - fixed #blackandwhite
1280 2018-05-16 21:16:15 Who will heal the land? The land where honey and milk once flow but now oil spillage has contaminated it.
1281 2018-05-16 21:15:57 Caden Highfield’s 3-R HR off the scoreboard in right field highlights a 5-R third inning for the Oilers. Oil City leads Titusville 7-5 heading to the 4th.
1282 2018-05-16 21:15:51 not entirely true--it was depressed til the JCPOA exit and is now up 30% since then since  price of oil has skyrocketed.
1283 2018-05-16 21:15:46 Well said, the world economy needs to change NOW! Oil is no longer the way to measure our worth. Sorry Alberta.
1284 2018-05-16 21:15:40 So @Lagoswater you think #Ramadan is the best time to start your stupid interruption in water supply???
1285 2018-05-16 21:15:31 So with these prices how come no ones asking the fracking or pipeline questions? Just another way for big oil to get our hard earned money 
1286 2018-05-16 21:15:20 Dude, part of nuclear deal was to relieve sanctions on Iranian oil. Doing so lowered the price of oil and therefore gas. We violated the deal and are placing sanctions back on Iranian oil. Why do you think the price of oil has ticked up in the week prior and since?
1287 2018-05-16 21:15:04 I only bought baby oil to give my doc marten’s massages at night but change of plans, I need my skin to shimmer at a reduced price
1288 2018-05-16 21:15:01 So, in other words, the truth is finally seeping out of his greasy, tanning oil and burger grease filled pores. Surprised anything could get through the layers of filth, but one pore has finally spewed out its silage.
1289 2018-05-16 21:14:46 i just ordered american chinese food with oil and msg and fried dumplings  
this is a horrible emoji
1290 2018-05-16 21:14:43 It's good. Unsalted butter and coconut oil and blended. It conditions the body to burn fat as energy and causes a slower release of the caffeine (so I read). It curbs my morning hunger allowing me to fast for 12-14 hours a day.
1291 2018-05-16 21:14:40 Deficit Doug Ford wants to lower the gas tax by 10 cents/litre. What happens when the oil companies simply increase the price of gas by yet another 10 cents/litre and Deficit Doug is left with the $3 billion bill (increasing his proposed deficity to $21 billion)? #onpoli #onelxn
1292 2018-05-16 21:14:36 Got stuck under the washer, and couldn't get out...knocked a bottle of lens immersion oil on Seth's $1500 cherry desk, when we moved, he started spraying Colin's closet...
1293 2018-05-16 21:14:32 Tea tree oil!!! It works miracles!!!! Thank you for asking
1294 2018-05-16 21:14:10 Butter and a bit of coconut oil...vanilla and cream...bulletproof coffee. It is good for you
1295 2018-05-16 21:14:04 I called regardless to Demand they vote it down.
1296 2018-05-16 21:13:54 i love those little yellow ones cut up and baked w rosemary and garlic and olive oil. this is good potato weather
1297 2018-05-16 21:13:50 I’m so excited,I ordered charlottes web capsules because I don’t think I’d like the oil taste 
1298 2018-05-16 21:13:48 Bring them people girl child from New York to Grenada to feed them boiled eggs and dumplings, worst yet  saying thats the national dish... Poor oil down  oui lol
1299 2018-05-16 21:13:47 @Schlage_Locks I have a 3 y/o keypad lever lock (FE575) in Oil Rubbed Bronze. It’s oxidizing pretty bad - I see directions for cleaning it  but they are confusing. veggie oil on rag & wipe, then use #10 oil on steel wool then furniture paste wax?! Or is this just a bad finish?
1300 2018-05-16 21:13:32 In the report you cite, environmental harm and ill health impacts of ANY activity are noted as the largest “subsidies”. And oilsands oil, full cycle including offsets and transportation, has GHG emission rates equivalent to other global sources of crude.

1306 2018-05-16 21:12:40 .@PnPCBC is it ironic that the guy extolling the benefits of the oil pipeline is choking on his own phlegm? #cdnpoli
1307 2018-05-16 21:12:39 Nice to have my hearing fully restored but it makes you think of those who can't get their hearing restored with a olive oil and a 10 minute doctor's appointmment with  a bit of high pressure water.
1308 2018-05-16 21:12:37 Meanwhile I'm taking notes about that essential oil.
1309 2018-05-16 21:12:27 OIL RIG

1310 2018-05-16 21:12:22 I don’t pay for oil changes, new brakes or nothing since my dad knows how to do all that. 
1311 2018-05-16 21:12:16 I need a rub down.. with hot oil my whole body aching 
1312 2018-05-16 21:12:14 In case your drunk, do some historical research on your dictators oil obsession!
1313 2018-05-16 21:12:14 There is a craptastic teacher at my kid’s school that we can’t get fired because she is “tenured.”  Maybe she is waiting for that amazing pension?
1314 2018-05-16 21:12:14 Ofcourse. That's why the oil money came in. To make the insignificant, significant.
1315 2018-05-16 21:12:12 Like I don’t necessarily think the product is bad because people do have eating compulsion dissorders so that can help but you could buy a little essential oil stick that u rub under your nose to help with cravings- Which is much better and natural.
1316 2018-05-16 21:12:02 Omg rose oil is literally everything
1317 2018-05-16 21:11:56 Last two days have been productive as fuck, got my insurance back on track, got the car into the shop for oil and maintenance, went to class to take my final, got all the bills paid, scheduled my appointments. Adulting is nice when you're organized mentally and financially. 
1318 2018-05-16 21:11:45 Boat
1319 2018-05-16 21:11:45 Okay but like...if I were a senator, I’d 100% take money from big companies before important votes. “Ah, yes, thanks for the new car!” “WHY DIDN’T YOU VOTE FOR US TO DRILL INTO POLAR BEARS FOR OIL?” “Did you see that this car has hidden cup holders?”
1320 2018-05-16 21:11:42 Sorry but I'm not interested in gold mines, oil wells, shipping or real estate...One item on your list intrigues me, the New York Inquirer,
1321 2018-05-16 21:11:19 Look at that. He totally changed his outlook on life. See it's not just money, money, money,oil more oil. Rex knows what time it is.
1322 2018-05-16 21:11:14 Let's do it one step at a time. You tell me where you disagree. 0) oil monopoly raises price. 1) at first firms have to borrow more to pay those prices (creating money). 2) Firms will try to raise retail prices, to push that cost into consumer. 3) Consumers will do some
1323 2018-05-16 21:11:08 Maintain a 'fierce defense of truth' like you did? 
You took 1 of Amer's most powerful positns, NOT 2 promote peace & solve conflicts, 4 which you were comp unqualified;
but 2 serve the interests of Big Oil & RU profits! 
You destroyed the State Dept,& its honored service ppl
1324 2018-05-16 21:11:05 2 & half hour wait for an oil change. Shitten me
1325 2018-05-16 21:11:04 Forte Oil that is in tormoil!! Lol
1326 2018-05-16 21:10:41 I put olive oil so it will get darker later

#wholetmegetachevyequinox
1328 2018-05-16 21:10:21 Okay. I’m getting my oil changed at the moment but should be done in 15-20

1332 2018-05-16 21:10:01 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
1333 2018-05-16 21:09:45 In a small state you can get weird data over single quarters. But also it wouldn't surprise me! Oil taketh, oil giveth.
1334 2018-05-16 21:09:35 Just because he loathes Trump that doesn’t mean I’m going to start liking an oil tycoon.  Sorry.
1335 2018-05-16 21:09:35 don't be casting shade on my powerpoints .. or whatever young folks like you and Nick say :)  dem babies helped sell a lot of oil in my day!
1336 2018-05-16 21:09:34 I swear to GOD coconut oil can never be praised enough
1337 2018-05-16 21:09:34 One thing in life that has never failed me is coconut oil
1338 2018-05-16 21:09:30 I want to suprise you. Nobody find any oil at golan and you can check it where you want
1339 2018-05-16 21:09:10 Me: I don’t know what I’m doing with my life and I feel lost all the time

20-year-old homeowner who makes double my salary and has 6 golden retrievers with their oil tycoon heir fiancé: Nobody does! We’re all just trying to figure it out (:
1340 2018-05-16 21:09:05 Oil?? Bruh that's how you know he hard working lol
1341 2018-05-16 21:09:02 When your free oil change isn't free... 
1342 2018-05-16 21:09:00 This oil change is not going to be the death of me because at least my car won’t blow up, but waiting for this oil change will be.
1343 2018-05-16 21:08:59 Rest assured that if any party in Ontario rolls back gas prices by 10 cents a litre, the greedy oil companies will increase cost 15 cents
1344 2018-05-16 21:08:58 Let stop selling our oil and hydro off to others for next to nothing , this govern. Is sell canada out from under us
1345 2018-05-16 21:08:57 You should be looking into and reporting on who is/are funding them..there are groups in the USA funding these anti oil pipeline protests in Canada..how is it that this has not been looked into ?
1346 2018-05-16 21:08:47 When you have cut soy from your diet due to allergies. Then accidentally eat something cooked in soybean oil. I feel like I could vomit and die right now....
1347 2018-05-16 21:08:41 I just feel a little bit sick now I may never be able to use danish oil again
1348 2018-05-16 21:08:38 It was about international arbitration, believe it or not (it would have been something like "oil company shakes Djibouti lawsuit"). I think I know a few people who likely would have given in to temptation, because how often do you get that kind of chance?
1349 2018-05-16 21:08:33 Oil is the answer. Jack Black Epic Moisture Nourishing Oil!
1350 2018-05-16 21:08:17 contrary to social media hair naturalistas, coconut oil works for my hair.
1351 2018-05-16 21:08:07 Snake OIL -- it is a dashboard company that locks in your data and rips you off for their servers

1353 2018-05-16 21:07:58 Lefties would rather children die at school than let the American ppl control their own fate.
1354 2018-05-16 21:07:48 Their answer actually did surprise me. I thought they might at least admit that no they would not drink it. I guess they will get enough money in oil company kickbacks that they can buy all the bottled water they would ever need.
1355 2018-05-16 21:07:46 I heard the gas buddy excuse the other day for the oil companies about how in the summer oil companies have to put additives in gas, can’t wait for the winter excuses!
1356 2018-05-16 21:07:41 Must try some of your oils soon

1361 2018-05-16 21:07:13 Their processable slate significantly heavier/more sour than U.S. refining system. It's no promised land for US oil.
1362 2018-05-16 21:07:12 Try coconut oil
1363 2018-05-16 21:07:03 "don't have nothing" is a double negative which implies they do, indeed have something to lose. Bernie Sanders sells snake oil by the gallon. He has a long track record of finger shaking while doing nothing. The only dependable thing he does is criticize. He. Will. Let. You. Down
1364 2018-05-16 21:07:02 So... The new donut shop we opened is next door to where I get my oil change, and I BADLY need one... but they close when I get out of work. 

One of them came in for drinks and I asked if I could bring it over quick and she took it over for me, did it all while I was working. 
1365 2018-05-16 21:06:50 I asked for a oil change ONLY don’t come at me with all that other stuff I don’t know about 
1366 2018-05-16 21:06:47 oe mais la vie d’oil si il avait posé tt seul genre une reprise ça aurait été propre
1367 2018-05-16 21:06:45 My face gets super fucking oily. Like I’ve used products that control oil and dry my face out but that makes my face produce more oils to compensate. I’ve also used lotions and moisturizers when my face is dry but this also ends up making me just as oily. Fml lol
1368 2018-05-16 21:06:40 The Steele Dossier claimed that in exchange for the easing of sanctions, Russians would provide Trump and his team with a stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft. Manafort’s notes say “133m shares.” Shares of Rosneft?? Without doubt! Follow the money

1370 2018-05-16 21:06:16 I just had a customer service moment with my mom... Where on the outside I have my poker face and on the inside all Im doing is screaming,
"NO MOM THAT IS OLIVE OIL STOP BEING STUBBORN DONT BE THAT PERSON"
1371 2018-05-16 21:06:16 It's going to take a lot more than some oil.
1372 2018-05-16 21:05:46 RANT FOR TODAY!!! Mr @POTUS time to stop making the Arabs rich. Do something about the inflated oil prices.  Time to full fill your promise to our Veterans.  DO IT TODAY!!!
1373 2018-05-16 21:05:42 ... .- .--. . .-.. -.- .. -. / ... .--. . .- -.- .. -. --.

So, Trump asked for a piece of the Russia's RosNeft (РосНефть) - which is short for "Russia's Oil"  - and promised the end of anti-Russian sanctions in exchange?

No Collusion... Sure...

Any comments @seanhannity ?

1376 2018-05-16 21:05:25 Semi-soggy, getting my car's oil changed.. May be fully soggy by the time it's done.
1377 2018-05-16 21:05:03 Körde även kremlin genom photoshopfiltret ”oil painting” för extra genuin känsla.
1378 2018-05-16 21:04:56 The majority of U.S. oil is imported from Canada and Mexico. 

Just throwin' it out there...  #MyContribution
1379 2018-05-16 21:04:33 They're good. I rarely buy them, usually just get tuna in oil or "paprykarz".
Sardines usualy go on kanapki (aparently "butter-brod" is the translation to English for some weird reason?); like the rest of them
1380 2018-05-16 21:04:13 I miss you more  I’m getting my oil changed save me 
1381 2018-05-16 21:04:10 Scotland: Has issues with NHS, mental health, oil, schools, funding, homelessness etc.

1383 2018-05-16 21:03:54 IF oil price goes up..shares go up too. Hence, Iran nuclear accord is gone, prices are going up..there you go.
1384 2018-05-16 21:03:41 Way to disassociate from the system: Make your own bath and body products using ingredients like coconut oil, essential oils, and herbal extracts.
1385 2018-05-16 21:03:35 fair enough. Keep your ears out for the Qataris and Kushner. You may not remember but Kushner was involved in a kerfluffle with Qataris. Also keep your ear out for Rosneft the Russia oil Co and Glencore which is part of Russia's payoff for lifting sanctions.
1386 2018-05-16 21:03:25 I currently drive a 1991 Jeep Wrangler so it's literally impossible for my oil woes to not improve
1387 2018-05-16 21:03:20 @RepShimkus John, If you haven't yet added coconut oil to you food, do so. Email me at coconut@hometel.com for my interactive file I first produced 4 yrs ago. 100% protection from sickness. My Alzheimers is reversed.
1388 2018-05-16 21:03:20 The theater with Netanyahu to make oil more expensive is a CLEAR attack on Europe. But Trump Europe is an ally of the USA, do not forget ...
1389 2018-05-16 21:03:17 So this is the noble lie the Right always complains about.
1390 2018-05-16 21:03:15 If you can demonstrate that your uterus has more regulation than firerms, I will personally give you 5000 dollars.  Cash. Seriously.  I'm not joking.  List all firearm regs and then your alleged Uterine regulations.  Go!

1404 2018-05-16 21:01:35 Ssshh no more talking about that oil, please.
1405 2018-05-16 21:01:30 Olive oil from my hummus leaked onto the seat of my car on Monday and the fact that I literally cannot deal with it is how I know I’m not an adult

1430 2018-05-16 21:00:04 Silicon Valley types made that popular, it fills you up so you can skip lunch and gives you a lot of energy. the downside being the fat of the butter/Coconut oil rises to the top and turns the coffee into a sort of broth. Personally I enjoy coffee too much to butcher it like that

You had your referendum in 2014 which Salmond said was for a generation

You trade more with rest of UK than you do with EU
What you need to do is get all the Scots working in England to go back home especially all the shop stewards who hate work

1436 2018-05-16 20:58:58 Everything looks set for this to be #AMER’s year. Everything is rising; production, cash, net backs and the oil price, the SP at some point will reflect this, and I’m sure positive drill results and decent reserves upgrade in the coming weeks will help

I'm asking my family doctor about it tomorrow since I have heart issues as well. Just a thought
1490 2018-05-16 20:53:34 It is my personal belief that Jamie Oliver is detrimental to my life. Back off the pizza you olive oil loving hypocrite.
1491 2018-05-16 20:53:29 I've also got a tomato salad that tastes great - cherry toms halved, bit of very finely minced or sliced garlic, a lot of fresh chopped coriander, bit of salt, fair bit of good balsamic and olive oil to coat. Best if left to marinade a bit.
1492 2018-05-16 20:53:23 Hmm ... confused 
Since when has Norway been famous for its horses and what’s that got to do with oil?
1493 2018-05-16 20:53:16 That is not fun! When I started trail running this year, I really messed up both ankles. I recommend lathering them up with castor oil as often as you can! I recommend it to all my patients for these types of ailments! The healing properties will get you back faster!
1494 2018-05-16 20:53:09 THE OIL POPPED UP AND LICKED MY HAND WHAT THE 
1495 2018-05-16 20:53:09 What to do while you get your oil changed: walk to Walgreens, buy nail polish, and paint your nails 
1496 2018-05-16 20:53:07 I don’t support our government financing this project. It’s approved, build it. Indirectly, all of Canada prospers off o&g, tsx was up the other day? Why, cause oil was up. Here’s a question, Why is that u living in mb feel you need to block it, how are you directly impacted?
1497 2018-05-16 20:53:07 Perhaps clear to you and others with a political agenda. To those who believe that Canadians should move away from tainted Saudi oil and be self sufficient the reality is clear. Build pipelines and do it in a responsible manner. Pointing to the indigenous argument is a cop out.
1498 2018-05-16 20:53:06 What's worst than the end of the blunt gettin in yo eye, that wiff of tea tree oil if u not careful LOL
1499 2018-05-16 20:53:05 Pipelines run beside and under natural bodies of water, should they be carrying oil? Tankers travel through our coastal waters, should they be carrying oil?
1500 2018-05-16 20:52:48 i just purchased some very expensive oil this shit better make my car run like its new
1501 2018-05-16 20:52:41 my allergies are acting up, but on a better note, my face is clear af  here’s the tea sis; Palmer’s anti dark spot complexion toner, Noxema, and coconut or tea tree oil (but there’s already Tea Tree oil made in the Palmer’s product) Thank me later 
1502 2018-05-16 20:52:38 Yessss!!!  I love this. Women supporting and complimenting each other. No oil her down syndrome
1503 2018-05-16 20:52:28 The Marathon Oil report includes part-time, casual & international employees & part-time retail store associates. 
1. If these employees were excluded what would happen to the "gap"?
2. Were part-time wages weighted to indicate the full-time equivalent?
1504 2018-05-16 20:52:24 How about you gain certain education , in this sense some grammar and spelling rulles . Afterwards, you are the "Chosen One " . It's written ALLAH and  pronounced as such  .Most certainly ,you are The " Servant of Gold Oil and Drugs". Have a nice , everlasting Life!
1505 2018-05-16 20:52:18 yikes, let that slip.
But we now live in a world where it's easy to miss oil spill or an ecoil outbreak in a local chain. For the past 20 years I've been like "whoa whoa whoa, wait a sec, what was that there?" with the news coverage
1506 2018-05-16 20:52:18 And coconut oil!
1507 2018-05-16 20:52:14 1- Total has not yet withdrawn but just officially repeated what it's been saying for months and 2- I highly doubt this has anything to do with #Saudi, @Total is present in nearly all MidEast countries and even operate #Qatar's largest oil field
1508 2018-05-16 20:52:07 Fresh oil change on my baby for this weekend so he can ride smooth 
1509 2018-05-16 20:51:53 I think it’ll look great once you get a finish on it. Always nice putting the first coat of oil on yew 
1510 2018-05-16 20:51:51 I would too. Renewables must be the future. And continued investment will allow us to scale up and reduce costs. But we’re a ways off from these things replacing the void that will be left by oil & has. So how will our nation play a roll to support AB, SK in the meantime?
1511 2018-05-16 20:51:48 Bona girl,give your hair a 2weeks treatment,wash it and apply coconut oil, in 7days try to make maphondo a manyane,apply oil nd wear a doek
1512 2018-05-16 20:51:46 I just exfoliated off all my tan, moisturised, put some coconut oil in my hair and about to do a face masklook after yourself, you'll feel great
1513 2018-05-16 20:51:42 Could be an interesting 2018 for successful oil explorers. Plenty happening over the next 6-12 months in the junior market. Glad I’m loaded into a few of them.

1518 2018-05-16 20:51:07 ....as oil prices hit multi year highs.  10/2, 10/1 is actually not much different from the beginning of the year.

1520 2018-05-16 20:50:49 So use solar and wind.........................don't raise the prices.  You have bio, solar and wind to turn to and these are established everywhere...................oil is passe' and pipelines and fracking are horrible for us and the environment..............
1521 2018-05-16 20:50:44 EXTRA Virgin Olive Oil.
1522 2018-05-16 20:50:40 The scene in Bad Neighbours 2 when Zac Efron dances covered in oil is overdue the cinematic recognition it deserves.
1523 2018-05-16 20:50:39 It is quite interesting, however, I’d prefer an oil or precious metals backed crypto! I’m just tired of stablecoins backed by fiats. The companies behind them are so proud to announce them as if USDT never existed.
1524 2018-05-16 20:50:34 @FirestoneAuto is trash, I swear if I could change oil an filters, rotate tires, while doing MY actual job  I WOULD NEVER SEND CARS THERE
1525 2018-05-16 20:50:30 @JustinTrudeau Welfare is for the poor not wealthy foreign oil corporations.  Congrats! You just lost the generation of voters that got you elected.

1548 2018-05-16 20:47:44 Are you referring to the Shah of Iran? The guy we installed after helping to overthrow the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh? We did so because he was going to nationalize BP in Iran. It was all about oil. Read more, turn off Fox.

1552 2018-05-16 20:47:23 Dropped a heavy oil pan at work, acted like it was my cell phone and used my foot to break it’s fall. Well it worked, however it fucked my whole shin in the process. Long story short, I gotta stop kicking at things when I drop them.
1553 2018-05-16 20:47:21 @jamieoliver Has got a cheek. Got a right belly on him and puts 12 pints of olive oil on all his recipes. Let people eat what they want and stop interfering you fat fuck.

Such a caring man!"
1564 2018-05-16 20:46:04 I’m getting an oil change and my phone Bluetooth connected to my car in the garage and the mechanic looked so confused when my podcast started playing.

1574 2018-05-16 20:44:53 Except for the Oil Money the Glazers aquired with George Bush through Zapata or does that not count as it not from the Middle East
1575 2018-05-16 20:44:41 Apparently athiests rank amongst the most intelligent people. As we question everything and don't take snake oil and smoke and mirrors as the divine truth.
1576 2018-05-16 20:44:40 Isn't the problem that the Oil don't have enough skilled players? This would potentially reduce the amount of skill.
1577 2018-05-16 20:44:39 ... some odd years has primarily attributed their wealth to oil and the cnd govt has thrown nearly its entire weight behind the Alberta gamble. It’s all going to fail in contest with other crudes available...
1578 2018-05-16 20:44:31 On my dead grandma y’all know I got my car stole at the beginning of the year so I ain’t for that no more a nigga just tried to hop in my shit at the oil change place I straight up my shit on buddy and tell him it’s too hot to be on that fck shit
1579 2018-05-16 20:44:28 #bcpoli #alberta "B.C. threatens to sue Alberta if 'unconstitutional' bill to block oil flow is passed"
1580 2018-05-16 20:44:27 This is exactly why one keeps massage oil in the nightstand drawer
1581 2018-05-16 20:44:26 whY dOes oiL pOP LIKE THAT
1582 2018-05-16 20:44:23 ... agreements vis vie having to distil bitumen into the form well enough to sell at the market value.  The oil sands cannot compete with other more easily accessible and much easier to distil into working forms of fuel crudes. It sucks how the Albertan govt of the past 30...
1583 2018-05-16 20:44:21 Buying a 06 Benz means your buying it already used, probably won’t get any benefits with the Benz. You buying a 2018 you get your free oil, warranty, maintenance all in buying a new car. $20 doesn’t even put a Benz to a quarter tank.
1584 2018-05-16 20:44:19 All the politics aside, Kinder makes absolutely no sense now. China is investing heavily in Iran oil, trump and Israel just made it a lot cheaper for them. Before it could be finished there will be no market for tar oil. Kinder knows this.
1585 2018-05-16 20:44:03 ... If the assertion is that our oil, which is mainly bitumen based, can be exported then it will yield us more resource revenue, I find questionable.  Why would a company invest in a resource that they could easily acquire elsewhere, without threatening their climate...

1588 2018-05-16 20:43:30 @netflix So I just got my Netlfix account and coincidentally I started to receive A LOT of publicity emails, from CBD oil to mattresses to insurance companies. Isn’t that odd? 
1589 2018-05-16 20:43:29 Someone just spelt Turmoil ; “Term Oil” on Facebook. 

May delete it now as that can’t be topped.
1590 2018-05-16 20:43:08 オリーブ界の頂点はここだよ。
1591 2018-05-16 20:43:05 "Data is the new oil of economy" EU Commission says. Estimated contribution to the EU economy is 450 billion € per year. More than half of Turkey's GDP. Latest developments on Digital Economies should be followed closely by Turkish authorities. #DigitalSingleMarket @ABBakanligi
1592 2018-05-16 20:43:04 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
1593 2018-05-16 20:43:00 Tea tree oil?
1594 2018-05-16 20:42:59 Give your head a shake.

The economy is growing faster than it ever did under Harper, investment is up in every sector except oil and gas, government spending is in lock step with GDP growth, and the debt as a percentage hasn’t increased.

These are all GOOD things.
1595 2018-05-16 20:42:56 Met a young man who now fights oil field fires who was the director of Ops at 911 Ground Zero. Thinks novacool is the best foam he's ever seen
1596 2018-05-16 20:42:54 But they did. Slide starts in fall of 2014, by new year people were talking about $30 oil, estimates and budget come out in spring 2015. Election called summer 2015. If you didn’t see it coming, then you can’t handle economic analysis. And, CPC surplus was official in 2016
1597 2018-05-16 20:42:52 I’ve done it. And coconut oil 
1598 2018-05-16 20:42:42 Because w that sort essentialist thinking obviously Nasser is not communist neither is Mossadegh, but thats not the point when Cold War or imperialist context requires support of pan-unions or oil nationalization. Ben Norton blocks this sort of praxis w the Puritan pontification
1599 2018-05-16 20:42:36 for good skin I recommend aloe vera, lots of water, and tree oil
1600 2018-05-16 20:42:31 Exactly! These people were not in their homes or yard or neighborhood when they were killed or injured. They travelled to the border for a Hamas-organized attack to breach the Israeli border. There should not have been an infant or child within that group.

1602 2018-05-16 20:42:00 So baby oil may of helped get me tan off, but it also managed to get all over me bedroom wall ruining that in the process
1603 2018-05-16 20:41:59 U were spot on regarding oil getting to 72 ish a while back. Hats off to u Jeff. Since we are close to the 50% marker of the all time high, are u expecting a pullback or is this headed higher toward 80? With the Saudis in firm control, I just don't know how oil can reverse down.
1604 2018-05-16 20:41:46 Jiffy Lube just saved a lady a bunch of money. They actually came out and told her she didn’t need an oil change yet.
1605 2018-05-16 20:41:36 I thought that DONG divested itself of all oil and gas assets before renaming itself Orsted?
1606 2018-05-16 20:41:32 watching jamie oliver get dragged to hell and back is very satisfying as someone who has had a vendetta towards him because of his overuse of oil for YEARS
1607 2018-05-16 20:41:24 You where no oil painting Matt.. great baller tough 
1608 2018-05-16 20:41:24 Yeah sure...”the market” dictates the price. Go ahead and see if the price of oil lines up with the price of gas over time. I’ll save you the time...it doesn’t.
1609 2018-05-16 20:41:19 Been masking my hair with coconut oil all week 
1610 2018-05-16 20:41:14 Should we continue to burn oil?
1611 2018-05-16 20:41:14 The overwhelming scientific consensus seems to be that it is basically a case of somebody turning into a human oil lamp. Which is horrifying in quite a different way but somewhat less terrifyingly incomprehensible.
1612 2018-05-16 20:41:14 Now that I’m home it’s time to get this hot oil treatment started, get this face mask on, and just enjoy some well needed R&R.
1613 2018-05-16 20:41:02 Ever heard of tow truck drivers that oil up wet roads?
1614 2018-05-16 20:40:57 It's more like "Failure to use a Factor Risk Model". Had it been done (I just did it), it would reveal that Oil Price explains less than 5% of XOM's share price variance. Market and other factor noise hides true relationships-like oil price. But these relationships ARE knowable.
1615 2018-05-16 20:40:54 If u think it is Justin Trudeaus fault that gas is high u r a fucking moron. It is u @CPC_HQ and Harper who always try and sanction Iran, thats one major cause of high prices, less oil produced causes high prices. #cdnpoli
1616 2018-05-16 20:40:50 Given the perpetual linear growth in imports, they are now importing from all corners they can where a great deal can be made. We even tracked oil out of southern Yemen; an area which hardly ever sees a VLCC. Venezuela is paying off debt in barrels.

1621 2018-05-16 20:40:09 The barrel cost is almost half of the 2008 price yet the pump price is almost as high. Equally, the CAD to USD rose and fell in lock step with the price of oil. Why isn’t that the case today?

1623 2018-05-16 20:40:07 There’s no such thing as going in for just an oil change
1624 2018-05-16 20:40:04 I have still never had chicken nuggets.

In other news, I tried to fry up some chips 2 nights ago and my mom didn't tell me that the oil was too old to use. So I tried to use it and it foamed out all over the stove. Been a long process to clean it up. It sucked.
1625 2018-05-16 20:40:03 @realDonaldTrump What are you going to do about gasoline prices???? Oil prices have doubled since you’ve been in office! Quit fighting for the antiquated coal industry and start fighting for ALL Americans.
1626 2018-05-16 20:39:48 I called a store asking if they had body oil, they said yes, when I got there, none. Only murder is alive in my heart today
1627 2018-05-16 20:39:46 When you get slammed by oil barron, you are pretty much low bottom feeder
1628 2018-05-16 20:39:43 That said, would be an entirely different story if the pipeline was sending oil from like Texas to Mexico or something, you'd see all these people all for it

He was no genius political strategist - a proxy-premier for the oil tycoons. @RachelNotley has more common sense asleep than Klein had in his whole lifetime. Big oil saw an opportunity to raze the land, Klein assisted
1634 2018-05-16 20:39:12 Ya so I just put the cauliflower florets in a zip bag with 2 tsp garlic powder , salt & pepper & some coconut oil or (butter)  mixed the bag up than put it on a cookie sheet in the over for 15 min at 450 . Take them out after and mix in a bowl with franks red hot sauce .
1635 2018-05-16 20:39:11 Yes, there's a drop in machinery and equipment, but most of the decrease in 2014 is from non-residential construction, which includes oil drilling. Given the timing, it's the drop in the oil price that's driving this. Don't see a consumption puzzle.

1641 2018-05-16 20:38:26 Pro-life is not regulation of your uterus honey. It’s called personal responsibility for your actions. You don’t want to get pregnant? Wrap it up, take a pill, or wrap it up and take the pill!
1642 2018-05-16 20:38:18 1/2 Hey, you have missed the whole rally, many oily stock up 100% in 2018. So, lets see. Your call, don't buy oil stocks as oil is going to $50 by May.  Oily stocks now up 100% in some cases, so your clients missed 100% and now you want then to wait for 20%.

1646 2018-05-16 20:37:42 And paying for those damn expensive oil changes! It has its pros and cons. Some people will pay whatever though.
1647 2018-05-16 20:37:38 As a governor owned by big oil (hence highest gas prices ever) you should sit down and read your Twitter responses and stop throwing stones.

1681 2018-05-16 20:35:08 The best gift for Putin is a rise in oil prices. Breaking Iran nuclear deal caused spike. Trump delivered for Putin again! 
1682 2018-05-16 20:35:08 I travel constantly between DC, PA and FL and I'm amazed that the rise in gas prices hasn't been an issue. I'm going to assume that the price of oil is not on the scale of President Obama's tan suit.

While we are talking about natural disasters...Curious how folks feel about the combination of forrest fires and oil spills.
1686 2018-05-16 20:34:55 Omg wtf?
1687 2018-05-16 20:34:37 As a kid I remember talking about solar, ethanol (gasahol!!!), extraction of oil from coal, wind. All that went away when gas became plentiful, then cheap

1691 2018-05-16 20:34:28 There is no Native American state. We have no home. All I am saying is don't help the USA with the border wall, don't help Mexico to fight the Zapatistas and don't help the oil companies monitor the rebel movements in the Amazon.

1702 2018-05-16 20:32:57 Does it also make it stronger? That's what I'm looking for. I've only taken it for 2 months and my tolerance is already too high. I just ordered some BSO. Kinda pricey for oil tbh. Praying it works because I have so much high quality kratom just sitting here lol.
1703 2018-05-16 20:32:51 I am used to walking round refineries watching where I walk; all round at all levels including looking on floor (oil, steam, pipes, valves, hoses, lumps of steel, pits). First time I have had to avoid goat faeces and small goats underfoot!! Never gets dull!
1704 2018-05-16 20:32:50 Oil price rises are going to eat into profits. Especially if it's large, then firms that use oil will have to raise retail prices. (It's a distributional conflict over who pays the increased cost of oil: firms or consumers)

1707 2018-05-16 20:32:19 Numbers you asserted didn’t account for the oil crash. They were given a surplus, and they were given economic growth, despite media saying during the election neither were realities. So, when they pledged a $10B deficit balanced b4 2019, they either misled or didn’t care

1730 2018-05-16 20:30:46 I don’t find that true because my family just got tax cuts that we really needed. We never got that shit with obama. Obama also shut down our oil production or a lot of it. Making gas prices go through the roof. He never cut taxes. Trump does shit for the people of USA.

1756 2018-05-16 20:28:50 Unfortunately whether we agree on the Iran deal or not, it did have an unwanted effect on gas prices. Energy stocks soared the next day & the mid-eastern oil countries raised their crude prices. Our gas prices then went up. They will come back down hopefully.

1759 2018-05-16 20:28:25 Coconut oil is a comedogenic and is not recommended for use especially after shaving or waxing. My waxer told me that. A fragrance-free baby lotion is best.

1768 2018-05-16 20:27:35 Less dreams with high THC products. I like a myrcene rich CBD strain in the vape with  a little THC oil before bed. That works the best for me.
1769 2018-05-16 20:27:30 Problems: the oil cannot simply be 'cleaned up' - some can, most remains as an environmental & health hazard; bigger issue is #KinderMorgan site is too dangerous to be located where a million+ people live, even Fire Dept. will not attend if a disaster occurs due to danger #bcpoli
1770 2018-05-16 20:27:27 Yeah mine was $113 and then he's like "your transmission fluid needs filled. It's $79. Wanna do that today?" And Im like maybe next time for that lol. Like please just fill the oil I know a lot is wrong I'm just pretending it's not 
1771 2018-05-16 20:27:10 You are absolutely right. They will deplete our oil wells and say go to.....
1772 2018-05-16 20:27:05 So NICS background check if you want to use it or like NFA items a federal lvl check with fingerprints and an LEO signature or a trust? You saying that shows your ignorance.
1773 2018-05-16 20:27:00 I did environmental compliance docs for work and when oil tanks were on tribal land/reservations a lot of the info was handled differently bc it wasn’t US land. I had a coworker who NEVER got it and got mad every time “they hid US info from the US”.
1774 2018-05-16 20:26:48 I just ate a huge hunk of carrot olive oil cake from the bakery nearby... WHAT IS LIFEEE 
1775 2018-05-16 20:26:45 So the 15 billion deficit and thousands of jobs lost in the oil industry dont exist?
Indi white paper author layer admitted it was a work of fiction and unworkable. Maihri Black recently admitted in a speech she did not beleive in it.
1776 2018-05-16 20:26:43 I used a non greasy Sanctuary Spa body oil & sleek highlighter. I didn’t wanna use anything expensive in case it never worked loool

1778 2018-05-16 20:26:28 The last coat of oil went on this today, it'll be coming with me to Make It Marple this Sunday. I'll pop sizes and price up tomorrow but now it's time to switch off.
1779 2018-05-16 20:26:24 @HSBCUKBusiness would be good to know who is the Oil and Gas expert interface to talk to. Aberdeen branch don't know ... so much for the Oil Capital of Europe......

1781 2018-05-16 20:26:02 Canada Gov still hasn’t properly “compensated” indigenous population but yeah let’s give the big oil company some more freebies while they fuck the earth
1782 2018-05-16 20:25:58 Right, but your question was, “How can you designate oil that can flow through to Wash St vs the oil that Alberta is cutting off given it all flows through BC to the same Pump Station…” And I answered how.
1783 2018-05-16 20:25:56 One day my momma sprayed oil sheen on her braids then tried to burn one of her ends that shit caught her hair on fire 
1784 2018-05-16 20:25:44 You encourage Yahoo. 
Few jobs pay money in millions and u have to build ur way up those jobs. Oil companies not inclusive though. 
How about encourage people to do their duty. Improve in your tasks and find a support for your dream in a lady.
1785 2018-05-16 20:25:32 Soak your feet first in like warm water with coconut oil or just soap. Then use the stone.
1786 2018-05-16 20:25:30 Good article to call our attention to Edward.

Oil majors are seeking “The Best barrels”, they are looking for the cheapest and easiest oil and gas to extract. 

Why? Because existing reserves are becoming stranded assets, too costly to extract.
1787 2018-05-16 20:25:22 Mmmm I need to try this one. The only one that works for me is the argan oil one.
1788 2018-05-16 20:24:58 I wish the oil industry would quit whining about the phrase "tar sands" and concentrate on important things like what they are doing to cut GHG emissions and remediate other pollution they have caused
1789 2018-05-16 20:24:49 I'm still not understanding why popular media plays into this despite the constant preface that "a lot of her responses are pre-written." Famous for being famous? We know Hanson is selling some AI snake oil... open letter time?
1790 2018-05-16 20:24:48 So tired of @RachelNotley threats. Gonna get her province sued just because she wants to act like a child.

Sure Rachel, reduce the amount of oil coming west, please. No really, cut it off. Let’s move on. 

Now BC can focus on solar thermal, PV, hydro, geothermal, tidal and wind

1792 2018-05-16 20:24:32 @onthemoney The Trudeau gov has lost its mind. Does it really think Canadians will accept tax dollars indemnifying a Texas oil company when its shareholders are getting cold feet about sustainability?
1793 2018-05-16 20:24:25 I have limited mechanic knowledge...I can change the oil and filters and lights out, but installing a new oil pan and brakes is above me at the moment
1794 2018-05-16 20:24:24 Hold cash and wait for a better buying opportunity. There is 20%+ downside in many energy stocks (particularly oil stocks) in our view from here into the end of Q3/18.

1799 2018-05-16 20:24:04 We think these resolve without much real volumes being impacted and will result in a sharp decline in crude oil prices in the coming months. We remain bearish on crude oil  and bullish on natural gas.

1812 2018-05-16 20:22:55 castor oil and put socks on you don't care about staining with oil. This will help restore moisture in your feet.
1813 2018-05-16 20:22:51 Lol “quickly losing its economic rationale”?? Go do some research on the demand of oil and gas in the world and what direction that demand is going in. Stop drinking the Kool-Aid bud
1814 2018-05-16 20:22:50 Hundreds of thousands of people do.  Great for the mind, anti-inflammatory, and a good to kickstart ketogenic + other diets.  Search for bulletproof coffee.  I put butter and MCT oil in it and blend it to perfection. Never felt better.
1815 2018-05-16 20:22:42 It’s bulletproof coffee. You could put coconut oil too.

1821 2018-05-16 20:22:13 @HSBC Wonderful, they are also taking tough stand on those dirty Canadians and their oil.
1822 2018-05-16 20:22:11 J'utilise les masques l'oreal deux fois par semaine, pour les boutons et cicatrices j'utilise Bio oil, chaque jour c'est savon bio + eau froide + crème hydratante hydragenius (simple c'est tout')
1823 2018-05-16 20:22:04 No mention of people affected by flooding from the snobby van doctor. Only concerned about oil shipments. You sir, are a god send to the B.C NDP. Keep being you bud.
1824 2018-05-16 20:21:58 Folks tell me lavender is good for relaxation, and it gives me headaches. (I can stand the plant outdoors within reason, but not the added scents/oil.)

1831 2018-05-16 20:21:32 We do a basic facial so cleanse, exfoliate, massage, & tone, a sugar glow treatment where you get a full body massage using a brown sugar scrub & oil and then a relaxation massage which is a full body massage with massage oil!!
1832 2018-05-16 20:21:21 To me it seems pulling out of the Iran agreement is about Iran doing deals with Total and Airbus rather than US oil and Boeing and overturning an Obama era initiative
1833 2018-05-16 20:21:12 WHO ARE YOU WANNA DRINK MOTOR OIL?
1834 2018-05-16 20:21:05 Yeah it’s working but eating meat is a big part of it. Only other fats you can have is like butters, coco oil, avocado, and etc. The key is to replace to carbs with fat

1840 2018-05-16 20:20:36 No just one reason, but I think an important one was that Sadam wanted to start trading oil with euros and other currencies besides USD. Not to mention to keep running the multi billion military industrial complex
1841 2018-05-16 20:20:36 It helps to dilute the tea tree with a little bit of coconut oil as it is an irritant and not only can cause dryness but minor MINOR burns. Definitely put it over your moisturizer!
1842 2018-05-16 20:20:36 Obamacare and single payer are about as different as vodka and caster oil. All you have to do is look at any first-world/civilized county (every one of them has single payer) to see the benefits. Costs raised in proportion with inflation.

1875 2018-05-16 20:17:09 It is thinner, and I hear they are working to get the consistency sorted out after changing manufacturers. I recommend letting the thinner paint sit on a piece of cardboard to soak up the excess oil and make it firmer 
1876 2018-05-16 20:17:05 Agreed. Just watch the oil levels and watch out for oil leaks. Only probs I’ve had with my Subaru are oil-related.
1877 2018-05-16 20:17:00 Former Buhari ally has pledged to privatize parts of #Nigeria's national oil company if he wins the pres. vote.This would attract investments & turn back the clock on Nigeria’s rampant corruption. #Privatization is just what the doctor ordered.

1885 2018-05-16 20:16:20 The drop in investment was almost exclusively in engineering structures investment, which is basically oil. Alternatively, switch to Monthly GDP by industry and look at the corresponding slump in mining support activities - aka drilling.
1886 2018-05-16 20:16:11 The Venezuelan government took control of the oil market to bring it back to the people, for the social good. And installed a dictatorship. More closely resembles your prized socialist country than Sweden. And good luck quantifying happiness.

1893 2018-05-16 20:15:02 Low oil pressure light on the Accord... That's a first. A sign maybe? My Honda service center couldn't be any nicer though. And thank goodness for @lyft making car drop-off painless
1894 2018-05-16 20:14:50 Not everyone in BC is an oil worker with oil worker money. In fact, I'd say the majority of BC residents don't work in the oil field. 

Just like the majority of BC residents care more about environmental issues than dollar signs. This pipeline affects every Canadian, not just AB
1895 2018-05-16 20:14:44 That makes two of us. @theJagmeetSingh assertion that @Bill_Morneau is giving a Texas oil company a blank cheque is wrong.
1896 2018-05-16 20:14:42 We have consistently been led by people who don't know about sourcing for money, only waiting for oil rent to come out of the ground. We will do it. We have a comprehensive plan to generate $7.5Bn Monthly to power these investments. A $90Bn annual investment. We'll do it well.
1897 2018-05-16 20:14:39 What facts are on your side? 
1898 2018-05-16 20:14:36 While Heyman's flip flop is regrettable, you shoud start listening to North Burnaby residents, who should NEVER be guinea pigs for Texas oil giant KM and Alberta's greed
1899 2018-05-16 20:14:24 I can see it now on the first episode or "Behind the Oil"

K. Gretzky: "I don't know if Connor fits what I'd call 'Oilers hockey'"

Chiarelli: "Yeah he gets too many of the points and there's not enough for the other guys."

KG: "Not a team player"

C: "Call Shero or Snow asap!"

1909 2018-05-16 20:13:10 @GasBuddy I just watched your disgusting explanation as to why gas prices are so high on CBC & it’s clear gas’s buddy is in the back pocket of big oil. Last time gas prices were this high oil was about $135 a barrel & then they said that gas prices were tied to oil prices!
1910 2018-05-16 20:12:57 it’s so stressful having to pay for and do everything yourself like I had to leave work to get my oil changed between clients and now I have to rush back to work so I can afford to pay for this and all my bills due next week???
1911 2018-05-16 20:12:57 Saudia, dare to offend, oil prices increase karwa doonga

1916 2018-05-16 20:12:08 Governor @MikeSonko nominates @Miguna Miguna for the position of #Nairobi Deputy Governor. I smell disaster. the two guys are like water and oil. I can bet with my life the two won't last the remainder of the term together.

1919 2018-05-16 20:11:56 Not women like these 2. They both voted for tax cut for the rich and opening up oil drilling in Alaska. They voted against the ACA (before voting to protect it). Saving Net Neutrality is a very good thing but lets no pretend these 2 cowards are shining examples of what we need.
1920 2018-05-16 20:11:52 When storing metal items, wipe all metal surfaces with a rag containing a few drops of machine oil to minimize oxidation or rust. 
1921 2018-05-16 20:11:44 I WANT TO LEARN HOW TO DO AN OIL CHANGE
1922 2018-05-16 20:11:43 Your girl needs an oil change  hit me up if you know where I should go #clueless
1923 2018-05-16 20:11:40 Whomever came up on my bag of Lavender I genuinely hope you enjoy it. Put it in some almond oil and lay it in the sun for a day or two. Anoint yourself cuz you deserve.
1924 2018-05-16 20:11:36 There are some, but still doesn't change people drive smaller cars than they used to.  It was after the oil price shocks in 1973 smaller cars started to come out.  In Europe where gas prices are much higher, smaller cars, most standard shift, and drive less.
1925 2018-05-16 20:11:36 Whole or oatmeal (healthy) or flatbread (tasty)
Roasted chicken with turkey breast

Lettuce-cucumber- green peppers 
Olive oil
+ a chocolate chip to balance it out
1926 2018-05-16 20:11:27 Just wow.  This will be the gift that keeps on giving.  Will other US pipeline companies now sue via NAFTA because their competition (KM) receiving unfair  subsidies?  Or stick a higher tariff on the incoming oil?

1940 2018-05-16 20:10:11 No Sonko is playing with someone's mind. He very well knows him and Miguna Miguna are like water and oil: can't mix!

1944 2018-05-16 20:09:44 It takes 5 plus gallons of crude oil to make one tire. Tires crude oil and motor oil all burn solid black smoke
1945 2018-05-16 20:09:37 here the micellar water infused with oil is class it leaves your skin feeling so SOFT
1946 2018-05-16 20:09:35 I don't think it's going to pass in the House.
1947 2018-05-16 20:09:32 I literally heard the plantain and oil sizzle in my head
1948 2018-05-16 20:09:27 We were doing great when I was little and my Dad worked at the oil refinery, but when he got laid off and my parents split things got rough. We were broke mostly but for a few years in Oklahoma we were straight up poor..no work out there, Dad literally dug ditches for $5/hr
1949 2018-05-16 20:09:14 Like I hate taking a big bite of some roasted/sauteed cauilflower and it's too big or I'm suddenly getting oil everywhere. Tiny pieces = nice.

But god no IT'S NOT RICE. It's like when those health food sites that post "desserts" made from Splenda, nuts, and children's tears.
1950 2018-05-16 20:09:06 Just paid 80$ to get told to change my oil more An start using premium oil...

1953 2018-05-16 20:08:43 I still think GE is crap. Sure it's worth something, but the world has moved on without it. It's just no longer needed. Now it's an oil play.
1954 2018-05-16 20:07:55 Finally getting my oil changed 
1955 2018-05-16 20:07:53 and lets just say for now that they SOLD THEIR SOUL to big oil
1956 2018-05-16 20:07:31 what body oil and what highlighter did you use?
1957 2018-05-16 20:07:31 So many cooking sites and chefs say rub oil with a piece of kitchen paper after using a cast iron pan, but an oil spray work much better for the job, I think.
1958 2018-05-16 20:07:29 I will never understand him being a Republican if he understands the problems caused by big oil. Did he not see that the GOP was backing the fossil fuel industry?
At least he seems to be on the right path now. 
He's right, it is murder, as is the pesticide/chemical industry.
1959 2018-05-16 20:07:24 In the 8 years since the Deepwater oil spill I’ve mostly commuted by bike. Have gone through 2 bikes, a few sets of tires, and a whole lot less gas.
1960 2018-05-16 20:07:23 The oil companies will not allow it. It is all a political stunt
1961 2018-05-16 20:07:07 Nope. Only had fresh gearbox oil. No other changes.

1968 2018-05-16 20:06:32 I love Tea Tree oil
1969 2018-05-16 20:06:31 There's is a huge difference between pro environment and anti oil.  Just because someone wants to advocate for making changes doesn't make them anti oil in any way.  It means they recognize we should look at other methods of power generation, and work on diversification.
1970 2018-05-16 20:06:31 All the politics aside, Kinder makes absolutely no sense now.
China is investing heavily in Iran oil, trump and Israel just made it a lot cheaper for them.
Before it could be finished there will be no market for tar oil.
1971 2018-05-16 20:06:18 My car take synthetic oil they put regular oil in there I sat there and made them drain all that oil back out put some more in .. not today

1978 2018-05-16 20:05:29 Is it just oil affected by these rising  flood waters Mr Wilkinson?  How about “people” and our futures. The Libs let the Province burn the past few years and now there is less vegetation up stream to absorb the snow melt.
1979 2018-05-16 20:05:24 Will they give free food?
1980 2018-05-16 20:05:24 Got real bad when they wanted to drill for gas and oil

Unionists have to face that or ignore it but they know its there niggling away
1996 2018-05-16 20:03:59 Oil up interest rates up and USD up also  something fishy  here!
1997 2018-05-16 20:03:35 The carbon tax in Alberta is about two or three cents a liter. When fuel goes up $.30 a liter, who do you think is gouging us? A. The government. B.  oil companies?
1998 2018-05-16 20:03:28 not entirely convinced that this isn't a ploy to see if I'll put olive oil on/in myself.

2000 2018-05-16 20:03:26 Aren't we going to start actually using our own mass of oil?  They may hike for a little but I wouldn't doubt they equalize.
2001 2018-05-16 20:03:14 If CBD oil can stop seizures, nausea and reduce pain and migraines....   Imagine how it could help our family and friends with the addictions that have become thier disease...

2015 2018-05-16 20:01:34 Oh hey the MN Senate is now debating the pipeline bill. (This is a controversial replacement pipeline in N MN for Canadian tar sands oil that could provoke Standing Rock style protests as it goes close to some trial lands)

2031 2018-05-16 20:00:22 The UV rays actually cause more oil production which can lead to further breakouts. Even worse, the rays work to thicken the outer layer of your skin that can trap contaminates in your pores.
2032 2018-05-16 20:00:20 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
2033 2018-05-16 20:00:19 I hate to tell you trump is not remotely intelligent & is likely to be barely literate. He's a snake oil salesman & always has been & has only ever been concerned with what is good for Trump period. CNN has a very good reputation globally & if a mistake is made it's corrected.
2034 2018-05-16 20:00:10 LOL Democrat or Republican... They are both owned by the money. This i guarantee you.. Money wins every election.. I have never held a political office.. But if i had a trillion dollars to blow.. I could be President in 2020.
2035 2018-05-16 20:00:09 Wouldn’t lube be like oil
2036 2018-05-16 20:00:06 Isn't MCT Oil instant ketones?

2039 2018-05-16 20:00:04 pro tip: if you use extra virgin olive oil that hookup doesn’t count
2040 2018-05-16 19:59:57 Hydrating before edc taking a shitload of vitamins & minerals and all I can taste and keep burping is fish from taking fish oil I’m so done
2041 2018-05-16 19:59:50 Isis shipped oil from Syria to Turkey under supervision of US/UK supervision. Only Syria/Russia effort put a stop to it. US policy re all countries/groups in the ME has been confusing for their allies, siding with Isis, Kurds, Turks etc at different times. Totally chaotic!
2042 2018-05-16 19:59:47 Drawing taught me a thing today. I’ve never been able to tell if skin “glows” bc Id look for brightness or literal oil sheens. When ppl say matte they mean dull. Matte skin is? less color saturated than dewy skin? Either kind may shine. It adds age if u dont wanna draw wrinkles.
2043 2018-05-16 19:59:28 What is Zithulele doing at Maluju Oil? Why we never seen Mazulu and  Zimele acting like proper couple? And WHY ARE WE STILL IN SUSPENSE OF THIS DAMN SECRET, IT'S BEEN A WHILE NOW?? #ImbewuTheSeed
2044 2018-05-16 19:59:24 Yay! Okay, you two are making me jazzed to oil the gears and put things in motion!

2046 2018-05-16 19:59:21 Shea moisture coco oil is so bomb it smells amazing and my skin is sooooo soft after
2047 2018-05-16 19:59:19 Really don’t feel like going to get an oil change 
2048 2018-05-16 19:59:07 I don’t use enough oil
2049 2018-05-16 19:59:05 I’m not crying. It’s just excess coconut oil escaping through my lacrimal glands.
2050 2018-05-16 19:59:04 The mechanic had a look at it, while he was waiting for the engine to cool down (to do belts). He emptied the gearbox oil & put fresh in, but also found a small part of the tooth that was sitting inside the casing.
2051 2018-05-16 19:58:57 If it’s natural it needs to be diluted, but if yours is in a carrier oil you’re bless
2052 2018-05-16 19:58:56 Just be careful y’all don’t get burnt with baby oil on in the sun! Heavy sunscreen first

2055 2018-05-16 19:58:27 Bless him Luke ran me a bath after netball with what he thought was a @LushLtd bath bomb. Turns out it was a massage bar which he had melted in the water so I was sat in oil and water. I stayed in for 10 mins because I felt bad then had a shower
2056 2018-05-16 19:58:25 Why don't u just use oil and flick it on top of the yoke while it cooks
2057 2018-05-16 19:58:23 How much palm oil holding it together? 
2058 2018-05-16 19:58:21 Those are RINO's not Freedom Loving Conservatives..  Where TF is Paul Ryan on this shit..?
2059 2018-05-16 19:58:19 Thanks for ABC-splaining! Boo and hiss to those silly duffers in Big Oil who aren't as clever and thoughtful or commercially adept as @abcnews.
2060 2018-05-16 19:58:13 @MigunaMiguna  nomination as DG is puzzling. Oil and water don’t mix
2061 2018-05-16 19:58:07 Zimele is so bossy telling Makhosi how to do her work! He thinks MaKhumalo works for Maluju Oil.#ImbewuTheSeed
2062 2018-05-16 19:58:05 I’m usually a @jamieoliver fan but this whole getting rid of 2 4 1 pizza deals is a stretch too far. People’s budgets are stretched out far enough and it’s a bit hypocritical too seeing all the oil he uses over salads and pasta dishes. #pizzaislife
2063 2018-05-16 19:58:01 Lol I wan be like you when I grow up
2064 2018-05-16 19:57:58 Federal and provincial NDP leadership at odds on this issue... Federal Libs willing to write a blank cheque for federal tax dollars to an oil company because they can’t get BC leadership to uphold the rule of law... How disorganized! Sort it out @JustinTrudeau!
2065 2018-05-16 19:57:56 What else is new?
2066 2018-05-16 19:57:29 @leachfortexas how much gas and oil money is in your campaign, the oil and gas industries support the Waiving of 30 EPA and Native American Laws to build wall, I wonder why????
2067 2018-05-16 19:57:18 Your argument is that support for universal health care is enough to make one not a capitalist? Think about that in relation to Trudeau.

Also: sustainable energy doesn't mean oil production stops, it's still needed. There's no indigenous land destruction involved in any of this.
2068 2018-05-16 19:57:15 I don't use anything with perfume and oil
2069 2018-05-16 19:57:03 Mr. Ford, are you claiming you will be interfering with business practices and the beloved "free market"? Gas prices rise because oil companies know they can lift them to a point and still sell. Promote green alternatives instead, so less cars are needed, perhaps?

2072 2018-05-16 19:56:54 Just seasoned a pan using peanut oil and not sure why I don't do this more often. My apartment smells like a latke factory.
2073 2018-05-16 19:56:50 Oil prices went up due to shortage of petroleum in the U.S
2074 2018-05-16 19:56:49 um yes my company has a variety of prospects in the Oil and Food industries, as well as the Food Oil industries (canola, olive, coconut etc...) please send your resume to LaneEntMakinBank@gmail.com
2075 2018-05-16 19:56:39 Have noticed crude oil is near $75 a barrel? Of course gas prices rise when oil prices rise. Stop blaming the #POTUS

2077 2018-05-16 19:56:26 That’s why you get smart and order from an online site like ECS tuning. Bmw wanted $1600 to do my oil feed and return lines for my turbo’s and $800 of that was parts. Got OEM bmw lines shipped to my door in 2 days for $310... shop smarter not harder
2078 2018-05-16 19:56:23 Notnus my pink oil moisturizer 
2079 2018-05-16 19:56:23 I’m not familiar with “Indian healing clay” but generally, clay masks can be very helpful for certain skin conditions like acne and excessive oil. I would not recommend clay for dry skin and would be cautious on sensitive skin. Seeing a professional is the best advice I can give.

2081 2018-05-16 19:56:20 The GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra is ongoing 24/7 by the British govt and their jihadists to steal oil in Nigeria and we are talking about coffee?.
2082 2018-05-16 19:56:19 I am so happy. I got my almond oil now
2083 2018-05-16 19:56:15 Proving once again that coconut oil/coconut based products are the solution to all life’s problems.
2084 2018-05-16 19:56:13 @IsaChandra I read your how to season a cast iron pan and I have one question, I hope not too stupid. When I season it (flaxseed oil) do I oil the pan inside and out, handle inc?

2086 2018-05-16 19:55:50 We made 227 barrels of oil last hour. Ok so 227x72=16,344 (72 is what a barrel of crude oil goes for atm). So that’s about 400 grand every 24 hours. Yup you guys need to go ahead and give me another raise.
2087 2018-05-16 19:55:46 None whatsoever

2092 2018-05-16 19:55:18 ‘Frameless oil’ was brilliant!

2096 2018-05-16 19:54:25 We abolished slavery after taking slaves. We’ve developed medicines and technology and sold them at massive profit. Yeah we fought for the Iraqis freedom, oh wait oil. What about Afghanistan? Oh oil pipelines. Most things we do have some sort of agenda. Believe that or not.
2097 2018-05-16 19:54:22 I’m going to the oil fields fuck it...put me on that slave life
2098 2018-05-16 19:54:12 Exactly what “science” is being ignored here? Is it the statistics that clearly show pipelines are the safest way to transport oil? Or the statistics around the number of jobs and government revenue generated by the oil and gas industry?
2099 2018-05-16 19:54:08 got this hot oil treatment in my head 
2100 2018-05-16 19:54:03 Most of this air pollution we cause results from the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, natural gas, and gasoline to produce electricity and power our vehicles.
2101 2018-05-16 19:53:52 What I meant was: how much of CDN investment is located in oil sector? Can oil price account for such a large move in aggregate investment spending?
2102 2018-05-16 19:53:48 Horrible. All he does is dress up and get social points for being accepting. He doesn't take his job seriously and get his stuff done. America beat us to an oil deal because Justin didn't get to business, but instead dressed up and ran around doing nothing. He doesn't even show -
2103 2018-05-16 19:53:29 Me too thinks. Miguna can't just work under anyone.. Water and oil that one
2104 2018-05-16 19:53:12 Business owners may be eligible for compensation, even if they do not believe that they suffered losses due to the BP oil spill.
2105 2018-05-16 19:53:11 Um. We had raid drills in my So Cali town every Friday at 11:45 am. 
We got under our desks. 
The oil refinery would blow a whistle and we would duck and cover.
This lasted until I was in the 3rd grade.

2108 2018-05-16 19:52:54 It’s amazing how many of the big bosses in the oil field can’t even tell you how many times they’ve been to jail for raising hell when they were your age. Lol most of their stories are wilder than every thing I’ve ever seen or done combined.

2129 2018-05-16 19:51:32 Completely agree - in countries where they are poor and NGOs help out they because of logistics and costs) provide food that is mostly grains and processed vegetable oil and they are gaining weight as a result.

2150 2018-05-16 19:49:10 I agree on oil. But trade generally continues to expand inexorably. Nick Clegg‘s assertion that trade is localised is bollocks. The world icontinually getting smaller. I certainly believe that 10% of exports will be to Europe because our exports are increasingly high value
2151 2018-05-16 19:49:07 No please. Great Nations all got different oil spots
2152 2018-05-16 19:49:04 The trains, a majority of oil/crude cars run on a schedule. 20+ years of driving that stretch to get to @Edmontonsun HQ 3pm to 3:30pm was bad, 5pm to 5:30pm bad, morning trains bad, other times as well full stop for 5,10,15 mins! No pipeline, need free flow #YegTraffic 75st next!
2153 2018-05-16 19:49:04 In Capitalism, the means of production are privately owned. In Marxism, the means of production cannot be privately owned. That's all. Sanders is ENTIRELY capitalist.
Also, Oil pipeline = pro-environment. The alternative is to ship by rail. The pipeline is better ecologically.
2154 2018-05-16 19:48:59 I like a good Trump slam as much as the next guy, but it's not as if oil baron, State Department dismantler and holder of the Russian Medal of friendship (literally pinned on him by Valdimir Putin) prioritized our countries best interests over his own.

2173 2018-05-16 19:46:56 Just wondered what you used as a spread for it that’s all. As you use butter then you’re not adding to the palm oil problem. Although if you buy sandwiches from other places then maybe you need to ask what they spread on them too.

2203 2018-05-16 19:44:25 You need to read more widely.

2219 2018-05-16 19:42:44 Bingo, dollar value is directly tied to Cdn investment. When oil was $140, our dollar was briefly at $1.10 US.

2222 2018-05-16 19:42:19 You’re arguing against yourself. The primary causes of the “subsidy” cited is environmental harm, health care costs from pollution and lowered taxes. The other day you mentioned that oilsands oil was worse than other imported oil, which is subject to lower ENV standards 1/3

2301 2018-05-16 19:34:51 Do you even *know* that the Coastal Plain is but 5% of the entire north slope?  That Exxon announced its biggest oil find in 30 years on one of its hundreds of leases farther west on the north slope? Do you even care? Sadly, no.  Be a hero.  Stop the leases!

Due to the lack of liquidity after 2:30 pm EST, 71.53, the D1 high, could be tough to break before market close. The odds of 71.53 level becoming a line in the sand overnight are high.
2308 2018-05-16 19:34:22 And in the "FactsRHard" column . . . 
1) Trump bombed Syria AFTER telling Russia where he was bombing. 
2) Trump REDUCED our energy independence by defunding renewables. 
3) Ending the Iran deal directly BENEFITS Russia/Putin because of their oil based economy.

2311 2018-05-16 19:34:05 Practical experience taught us and others that cannabis inputs to oil programs need to be released in the same fashion as batches slated for sales of flower products direct to end users. The ACMPR is, after all, highly interpretive and enforced at the discretion of the regulator.

2313 2018-05-16 19:34:03 those lumberjack competitions are Grade-A broadcasts to watch while you wait to get your oil changed or something like that. the best
2314 2018-05-16 19:34:00 The trick is to douse yourself in coconut oil while you’re tanning so you look and smell like a burnt cookie
2315 2018-05-16 19:33:55 In the summer I do, because the oil runs freely.
2316 2018-05-16 19:33:50 Scott Pruitt is working on taking apart the EPA which helps protect our environment and our futures.  All for the benefit of big business.  But I’m sure you’d rather die of cancer than let big oil or auto industry lose money.
2317 2018-05-16 19:33:43 Can oil and water mix? @MikeSonko and Miguna cannot work together. One is a socialite while thw other is pointblank blunt and honest and speaks his mind!!

Facts matter. #EDU2018
2321 2018-05-16 19:32:24 This implies Chinese oil consumption will also peak around 2025. FWIW this is broadly consistent with my personal "simplistic" expectations for peak oil demand by mid 2020s, which is based on math curve-fitting. i..e. Theory-free - Market forecasts itself.

2327 2018-05-16 19:31:51 While your at it see if you can find out why media stopped talking about democrats sueing big oil for climate change. Since gas prices started climbing after the 12cent hike   Now it's as if I never was mentioned yet 59 cents a gallon later it's all a mystery as if

2335 2018-05-16 19:30:37 That is great news. Hopefully the start of oil being traded in anything other than dollars.
2336 2018-05-16 19:30:36 #edu2018 #RenewableEnergy is experiencing 24-28% annual gains through the experience curve. #oil and #gas cannot compete without sharing more lessons with each other.
2337 2018-05-16 19:30:34 And the question is, why?  Do they really believe this?  I don’t think so, it’s a profit making business and if there’s a market for snake oil, they’ll creatively deliver to that market.  It’s feels nefarious to make money from lying and denying facts-truth.
2338 2018-05-16 19:30:32 Lol... so now you’re comparing oil trains to oil tankers. Pipelines and tankers are the safest way to move oil, by far! Guess you would rather see more oil trains along the Fraser, and its communities?

2341 2018-05-16 19:30:20 The "u.s." heavily subsidizes the Israeli regime's occupation of Palestine for the Israeli regime to help the "u.s." control oil & other resources in West & Central Asia & N. Africa. #FreePalestine
2342 2018-05-16 19:30:15 Will the federal government also pay the oil industry to keep violating free, prior, and informed consent from Indigenous peoples in BC? It's shocking to see the federal government offer an unlimited backstop to a dinosaur industry

2344 2018-05-16 19:30:11 No....this has not been done. You are creating a safety record based on 60 years of nothing and comparing that to the proposed 40 oil tankers passing through the Inlet every month, that's more than one each day!

2346 2018-05-16 19:29:41 I think we need more oil.
2347 2018-05-16 19:29:17 I’m about to slap some baby oil on and get darker
2348 2018-05-16 19:29:10 And then #Trump pulls out of the #JCPOA and threatens further sanctions on Iran. #Oil is expected to hit $100 when that happens.
2349 2018-05-16 19:29:03 Trump is vowing to exit the Iran nuclear deal and will carry out sanctions on Opec. This will increase the price of oil and gas in the US. The good news is we are getting more shale production in the United States. Go USA!
2350 2018-05-16 19:28:53 Whether we exclude oil, or just stay mindful of its impact, is a question of judgement.
2351 2018-05-16 19:28:42 Did some oiling. I love the smell of linseed oil in the morning...or the afternoon or late at night... :)
2352 2018-05-16 19:28:39 The world doesn’t care because their is no oil in Gaza
2353 2018-05-16 19:28:37 My fav way to do them us to cut them longways, not too thick, drizzle with olive oil & griddle  Otherwise I find cooking them in coconut oil in a pan on a low heat works out best  #PassionPassport
2354 2018-05-16 19:28:35 It's risky...in case you forget already...because the proposal increases oil tanker traffic 7 times! If you look at the Lac Mégantic oil fire example you have an increase of flammable oil passing through a much smaller populated area with considerable consequences.
2355 2018-05-16 19:28:29 Nodi. Congress never ever worked so hard wen it was in power . Very slow in getting legislation , bills etc . See how they r burning midnight oil to stop Yeddyurappa from taking oath in the morning.

2370 2018-05-16 19:26:22 I’ll blow 400 on a hoodie but the moment I need a oil change I do that shit myself fuck that lmao
2371 2018-05-16 19:26:18 Stainless steel #nameplates are extremely durable, and they can withstand the harsh environments common in the oil and gas industry.
2372 2018-05-16 19:26:11 Wrong. Just plain wrong. The biggest battle was with Obama, who has similar political leanings. He didn’t want the “dirty oil” flowing into the US, so Keystone was blocked. Tell me, sir, how are we to build a pipeline when 2/3 of it wouldn’t be approved by a liberal in the USA?
2373 2018-05-16 19:26:10 This isn't a game show! This is about Aframax oil tankers carrying 650 000 barrels of heavy oil passing through Metro Vancouver everyday on their way to Asia...if this goes ahead. As I clearly pointed out to you already, this is something new. You have nothing to compare it to!
2374 2018-05-16 19:25:59 also the 5 different oil diffusers/incense lol

2378 2018-05-16 19:25:21 Yes and yes and yes. But we aren’t just talking about food and medicine. Oil for example - sanctions on oil led to the rise of people like Zanjani - we agree here I believe

2380 2018-05-16 19:25:13 I just purchased Hellmans Mayo with Olive Oil and there was no clear wrap on the top the bottle once you took the cap off. Is this normal? @Hellmanns
2381 2018-05-16 19:25:09 usa have had suppressed gasoline costs.  Now selling more oil to europe raises prices here?  I think.  So our rates are going to increase more in line with what europe pays.   But at same time the hope is to bring their rates down.

2392 2018-05-16 19:23:59 the only thing that actually saved russia from a similarly catastrophic crisis when the post-1991 government fell out of favor with washington and oil prices fell was the fact that the population was shrinking due to the economic hardships of the 1990s
2393 2018-05-16 19:23:46 "Singaporean oil stocks dropped 8.1 mb m-o-m in April to 38.5 mb, their lowest level since Dec 2013. Lower imports of fuel oil from Venezuela and Europe were the main reason" -IEA

2395 2018-05-16 19:23:27 You need to reread the ACMPR. The cannabis destined for oil extraction needs to pass compliance before and after it is processed.

2399 2018-05-16 19:22:58 Isn't it the Left's rule that we can't critically discuss anything that we haven't lived or at least immersed ourselves in so thoroughly as to have "gone native"?
2400 2018-05-16 19:22:55 No I know hahaha it wasn’t on purpose. I waxed my upper lip and the package said to remove the extra wax with baby oil, so I did, and afterwards I ate and got baby oil in my food and almost puked
2401 2018-05-16 19:22:51 A3: Low-income communities carry the burden of extractive fossil fuel economy-goods movement, oil refining, transport etc.  For example, Richmond’s black community has dealt with the environmental impacts of Chevron’s oil refinery for decades#Build4Resilience
2402 2018-05-16 19:22:43 I have very real anxiety over taking my car to get work done. Even an oil change. Help.
2403 2018-05-16 19:22:37 The baby oil trick to get fake tan off actually works so much better than I thought it would 
2404 2018-05-16 19:22:36 You're looking at the open ocean. Trying to make this #KM discussion to about all the oil tankers in the world when in fact...this is about oil tankers full of 650 000 barrels of heavy oil passing through Metro Vancouver.
2405 2018-05-16 19:22:20 I agree, but you ignore Obama's actions on oil? he was far worse. Arctic drilling, the pipeline, etc.. Again, whenever you look, IT'S BOTH PARTIES BEING AWFUL

2408 2018-05-16 19:21:55 How do we get in touch with the person?
2409 2018-05-16 19:21:53 Irresponsible ad in!  It is not a choice between the planet and plastic. Plastic is recyclable. At the very least it can be ground up and added back into crude oil! It is human behavior that needs adjusting!
2410 2018-05-16 19:21:53 I've been an Oil fan since 1973. If this happens i'm done with this team. You'd have to be a fucking moron to make this deal as Oiler GM. Which is exactly why its a real possibility.
2411 2018-05-16 19:21:51 Top patladı yatsı okundu hala usdpide 4.40 kusurlerde olacak iş değil . Oil de aynen .
2412 2018-05-16 19:21:40 It’s not that bad. The parts are $150, everything else is shop rate. The oil pan is a 16 hour job.
2413 2018-05-16 19:21:37 I try picturing 20 Years from now when oil will be a second class source of energy,as renewable energy sources would've taken over the market.
2414 2018-05-16 19:21:30 Mums just poured a full pan of oil lucky it was cold all over herself and the floor 
2415 2018-05-16 19:21:04 Lol yeah I'm gonna have to take my hooker chariat in and get the oil changed and some other stuff because I put it away and didn't do her right! The n I'll be taking it out and kic kin some bass butt!
2416 2018-05-16 19:20:56 doesn't redeem him from being an oil subsidy thief!
2417 2018-05-16 19:20:54 You could have fool me. This looks amazing. I thought it was oil.
2418 2018-05-16 19:20:51 We got over a million barrels per day of pipelines under @stephenharper and today the differential on light oil is virtually gone.  These are black & white facts.  How can you not know them?

@JustinTrudeau has only cancelled pipelines so far - i get you're trying!

@jkenney
2419 2018-05-16 19:20:42 Good suggestion, but maybe CBD oil could help just as well without the hallucinogenic effects? Something to look into!
2420 2018-05-16 19:20:38 I share the same view and think they must be highly monitored with very strict regulations. We don't need any more exploding fireballs.
I just don't u/s the reasons against pipelines. If it's bc it's oil/bitumen, then why aren't people protesting the trucks/trains?
2421 2018-05-16 19:20:32 Yesss! I have slippery elm root! I haven't tried aloe vera juice or hemp oil but I'm going to. I have L-glutamine, milk thistle and barberry extract that i take every day. Thank you

Awesome Geeta, Andree-Lise and David...oil and gas is a bridge to the post carbon energy world....all bridges have an end...O&G is a sunset industry (Go Geeta!) so we must invest in what is replacing us now while we have the resources to do it. We need the leadership.
2423 2018-05-16 19:20:30 Very few oil tankers out of Westridge Marine Terminal. Where the Kinder Morgan Pipeline reaches tidewater...what this discussion is all about. You continue to show maps of the open ocean when this is about Metro Vancouver, one of North America's most densely populated cities!
2424 2018-05-16 19:20:29 March 21, 1980 for Bruno.  I thought you were referring to oil refinery explosion

2426 2018-05-16 19:19:58 I remember looking at similar data across EU member states a decade ago and we ended up excluding anywhere with a large oil sector, because GVA was too highly correlated with oil prices. Could you look at the same sector across regions?
2427 2018-05-16 19:19:56 Prove it.  Stop the drilling leases for the Arctic National Wildlife REFUGE.
The Coastal Plain was not set aside to become an oil field.  It was set aside to be a REFUGE.  For over 40 years the MAJORITY OF AMERICAN PEOPLE  have decided they wish their REFUGE to be just that.
2428 2018-05-16 19:19:55 Y'know, it sure is weird how when I ate processed crap I was 230lbs, but when I eat meat, veg, fruit, oil, nuts, and cheeses, I'm 120lbs, and I'm never hungry.  I literally forget to eat for a few days at a time sometimes.  Seems like they just wanted to sell me TONS of food.
2429 2018-05-16 19:19:46 Tell us more about the oil change scams!!
2430 2018-05-16 19:19:45 Does the olive oil one have soybean oil as well?
2431 2018-05-16 19:19:44 Hi All...need your help...anyone local to Alsager know where we can get an large oil drum for burning? Thanks in advance
2432 2018-05-16 19:19:44 That’s not necessarily true in all cases, but likely in many. It will not be necessary for cannabis destined for oil extraction, depending on the technology used.
2433 2018-05-16 19:19:38 I agree w/Mum, Ricky! Oil = BAD!
2434 2018-05-16 19:19:35 Or e don collect oil block.

2440 2018-05-16 19:19:02 Tillerson, did Putin give you permission to say this? If not, will you have to give him back your Russian medal? Were you able to have the Russian oil sanctions lifted before you left? Do you know how many loans Putin facilitated to the Trump family? Asking 4 a Russian friend.

2442 2018-05-16 19:18:58 alright. out of 18 years of living in Gallia. i've seen the weirdest thing. while driving home from the school i seen two hefty women outside and one had her arms up while the other was smearing mud on the others titties. idk if that was a sexual thing or essential oil stuff.
2443 2018-05-16 19:18:56 @PaysTara hey, I noticed you worked in oil from a previous tweet of yours. I'm working on a piece on the industry and would appreciate your perspective. Did you re-enter the field, or move on to another sector? Feel free to message me, my DMs are open. Thanks.

2463 2018-05-16 19:17:04 Of course the countries in the article are ecstatic, they know we will have to buy more oil from them, to fill the deficit of leaving the Iran deal. Oil is already going up, and projected for record numbers 
2464 2018-05-16 19:17:01 I suffer a lot to the point of dizziness and wanting to vomit. Try mint oil in a cup of boiling water and inhale the vapours. Or try the nasal flush, I get them from boots, Netipot, warm salt water up the nose and you’ll be amazed what comes out.
2465 2018-05-16 19:17:01 My boyfriend came to my job, picked up my car, filled up my tank, did my oil change, and washed my car

2476 2018-05-16 19:15:36 @mayorblaine hey, I read from one of your earlier tweets you worked in the oil sector. I'm writing a piece on the industry and would appreciate your insight. If you'd like to get in touch, my messages are open. I look forward to chatting, Thanks.
2477 2018-05-16 19:15:34 "Potential double supply shortfall represented by #Iran and #Venezuela could present a major challenge for producers to fend off sharp price rises and fill the gap, not just in terms of the number of barrels but also in terms of oil quality" -IEA
2478 2018-05-16 19:15:30 @Convertbond So let me get this straight. Nov 2016 OPEC cuts prod by 1.2 mil/day (now listed at 1.8 mil/day).  US production then was 8.6 mil/day, now its 10.723 mil/day, an increase of 2.1 mil/day.  Sooo, why is oil barreling toward $100? (other than emotion and momentum)
2479 2018-05-16 19:15:20 Big spending on infrastrcture was indeed backended for the 2018 & 2019 (electoral play no doubt, maybe also to give time to find projects). But no, LPC costed their platform using early 2015 number (which came from Sept 2014) — oil crash happened in two parts as well; 2014 & 2015
2480 2018-05-16 19:15:19 Lool okay minus the oil 
2481 2018-05-16 19:15:19 When do the Tax Cuts kick in and protect the US Consumer from inflated Foreign Oil prices? US is Domestic Oil supplied, by US Oil Companies, benefitting $2.5 Trillion from 2017 Tax Cuts Bill.

2488 2018-05-16 19:14:56 @HempmasterQuan Have you heard of liposomal hemp oil that absorbs 95% into the body subligually?
2489 2018-05-16 19:14:56 They are blessed with oil so that they will use their money as they want it when they want it.
2490 2018-05-16 19:14:53 Another insider on the oil price manipulation?
2491 2018-05-16 19:14:37 Presumably, 1500 ppm from mostly fossil fuel CO2 could also be reached with primary energy supply that includes a larger mix of oil shale, but even though oil shale resources are vast, they still aren’t large enough to do it alone, so transition to coal would be more likely

2499 2018-05-16 19:14:03 And, of course, there may well be a trillion involved: the cost of cleaning up the mess after the oil companies walk away from their obligations. The "abandoned well fund" they set up doesn't pay a fraction of the cost of current abandoned wells.
2500 2018-05-16 19:13:59 why can’t i ever open my coconut oil jar ughhhh
2501 2018-05-16 19:13:50 Putting control in the hands of government at the behest of a cadre of lobbyists. 
No other reason possible since it's not broke now
2502 2018-05-16 19:13:41 No buyers??? Someone will buy the oil, and we will receive tax revenue and an increase in jobs as a result of the pipeline. Idc about KM, I care about Canada.
2503 2018-05-16 19:13:39 Or perhaps she intends to use copious quantities of baby oil. (Shudder.)
2504 2018-05-16 19:13:34 By blocking pipelines, eco-sovereigntist and anti-foreign investment groups are hurting Canadian workers and families by tying up Canada's rail system with oil cars. That's stopping grain, lumber and other products from getting to market. That's the reality and it's a big mess.

2514 2018-05-16 19:12:06 Oil crash was well before 2015 so that’s not an excuse and regardless of how the books were done, they had the numbers, they see the estimates, they promised $10B, they reneged. Then they said they’d do stimulus spending, and it ended up being a pittance on actual infrastructure

2524 2018-05-16 19:10:59 If the ingredient info I found online is correct, the chips have sunflower oil and added salt which would mean they’re only Whole 30 compliant in the loosest possible sense. (I got excited by the prospect of “real” Whole 30 chips for a second )
2525 2018-05-16 19:10:51 I haven't the slightest sympathy or respect for any Ford or @OntarioPCParty supporter at this point. They're too intellectually lazy to see him and the party as the snake oil salesmen they are. And if they win, fuck every one of 'em with a combine harvester.

2537 2018-05-16 19:09:18 I really think it will be OK. MY hair is curly so it's super porous and has already soaked up most of the oil. Plus the shampoo/gel etc. I use has coconut oil in it and I've never had a problem with greasiness. But we'll see!
2538 2018-05-16 19:09:17 You know what pays for all that stuff like healthcare, child care etc?   FUCKIN OIL MONEY! Please tell me how else you plan to pay for all this
2539 2018-05-16 19:09:10 Maybe in our lifetimes, once the oil economy collapses...
2540 2018-05-16 19:08:57 Perhaps Mr. Gore should worry about his own country. Most Canadians support the Kinder Morgan pipeline and majority of BC residents like myself. We don’t want oil to be moved by surface transport. Horgan is playing games to keep Green Party’s support to stay in power.

2551 2018-05-16 19:06:56 Look at the history of the oil market or any market for that matter, there are always going to be ups and downs. The companies investing in mega projects have to be assured that they can get their product to market and that the country is safe place to invest.
2552 2018-05-16 19:06:48 I think you’re thinking of Iran, not Iraq. Iraq’s oil industry was nationalised before Saddam seized power (in a bloodless coup, the killing came later) & the CIA allegedly first tried to oust him even before that

2556 2018-05-16 19:06:29 Love Jamie Oliver trying to get unhealthy food deals banned yet the guy absolutely drenches the food he cooks in oil and other unhealthy fats. Prick
2557 2018-05-16 19:06:27 A message from Jason Niederkorn:
I worked with you at Stars SF from 96-99. I was you’re commis in the Grill Room. I just opened my restaurant in Indian Wells. Would love to host or cook with you again. I will never forget, “white truffle oil is the cheap whore of garnishes.”
2558 2018-05-16 19:06:16 And face?
2559 2018-05-16 19:06:15 I'm going to mix them with my Neutrogena body oil first then mix them with my jojoba oil and see if there's a difference.
2560 2018-05-16 19:05:59 that wild growth oil>>>
2561 2018-05-16 19:05:58 this oil in bath to remove fake tan is bullshit just wasted an hour to come out orange and greasy
2562 2018-05-16 19:05:32 Like Norway but with far more oil, gas, renewables Etc.?
2563 2018-05-16 19:05:30 This increased deficit is mostly because of how CPC balanced the books during the run-up to 2015, and the oil price crash of that summer — a larger deficit was required to fund the promises that were costed using outdated numbers. Canada was technically in a recession in 2015.
2564 2018-05-16 19:05:25 If it's leaking water then you need to add more water. My car had similar problems with oil
2565 2018-05-16 19:05:11 By the way, Notley saying she is considering shutting off oil/gas to BC... There is no way right now she can do that. BC interier fighting wors't flooding on 200 years. They need that gas etc to fight these floods in all these areas.
2566 2018-05-16 19:05:07 Hi, @JiffyLube. This weekend I went to get an oil change. I left with an enormous new dent in my car's driver's side panel your store conveniently has no proof that they caused, but that they definitely caused. Please get better cameras at your store. Also, GFY. Thanks.

2568 2018-05-16 19:05:02 Instead to wasting money with big oil why don't you look after the retirees that can't afford their hydro bills and have to decide to pay it or buy food.
2569 2018-05-16 19:04:57 But health-food stores featuring walls lined with shelves upon shelves of snake oil ... cool. Snake oil peddlers lined up to fleece ... errr fix it. Typical anti-science hypocrisy.
2570 2018-05-16 19:04:51 That works and coconut oil works,  but it’s better to go to dentist and let them do it for more dramatic results
2571 2018-05-16 19:04:51 Is it wrong to respond to her question with the question of what's wrong with women???
2572 2018-05-16 19:04:49 I think the orange oil I bought will overpower the Narcissus and White Musk but we'll see.

2575 2018-05-16 19:04:21 @Convertbond BTW - last week we exported 24% of the oil we pumped (18 mil out of 75 mil pumped)
2576 2018-05-16 19:04:15 We can thank Trump pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Agreement.  Oil/Gas Prices will double

2578 2018-05-16 19:03:35 I like to divide the year in two, the part of the year when coconut oil is solid and difficult to spread and when it’s soft and smooth.
2579 2018-05-16 19:03:28 @NDP @jjhorgan let AB build their pipeline to 10 km fr. BC/AB border- then use trucks- least Cdns will KNOW exactly how much oil is spilled vs how LONG a pipe spill leaked n2 the environment- truckers need jobs too-one idea
2580 2018-05-16 19:03:20 Brand new car battery and oil change for free thank you God 
2581 2018-05-16 19:03:17 Track record counts.  As does external demand for them.  Larry R impeccable.  Boughner (Windsor Mem Cups/CBJ) and Sport (Kitchener HC&GM/Marlies/Leafs) both NHL head coach capable, as Bough proved.  Yawney winning track record and in demand.  Oil's 17/18 AC's in comparison?
2582 2018-05-16 19:02:40 Honestly, I have no idea because it has coconut oil and sometimes sugar in it as well. It smells amazing. 
2583 2018-05-16 19:02:37 @Convertbond Oil stock falls 1.4 million barrels.  Everyone's focused on OPEC, but the real story is US exports.  Last week we exported 18 mil barrels of oil. Week before 13 mil.  Week after week for the past year. That's a heck of a lot of oil leaving.
2584 2018-05-16 19:02:35 The people against pipelines will not quit using oil or oil products. They are just a bunch of hypocrites. There will always be a need for oil and oil products.
2585 2018-05-16 19:02:32 No it's because you oil up and hit the gym
2586 2018-05-16 19:02:32 So the boy comes to Alberta to announce a rail underpass for $40m
Roughly what we lose per day in discounted oil due to lack of pipelines, an idiot child.
2587 2018-05-16 19:02:30 What's all over her arms!?
2588 2018-05-16 19:02:30 Given the stock crises (1920's, 1980s) , housing crisis (recent past), standard oil crisis (y'know back in 1870) all were sideways... but this time it will work? History isn't on your side here.
2589 2018-05-16 19:02:25 Speaking as a 70's entry-level hire at a multinational oil co. who was less successful at working my way up the corporate ladder than Rex, please allow me to say that having worked for a multinational oil company doesn't mean that you are a bad person. Not necessarily, anyway.
2590 2018-05-16 19:02:24 Time to break out the coconut oil
2591 2018-05-16 19:02:22 not every area has a those shops in walking distance, some people will not have the time to make meals every night as well. And use Jamie olviver recipies that have a shit ton of butter and oil in them. Along with his milkshake having a shit tone of sugar as well?
2592 2018-05-16 19:02:21 Oh good. It is going to be really, really hot in DC this summer. It is only right that they must suffer with the rest of the country because they think: "there is no #GlobalWarming  and if there is, it isn't caused by human action" by which they mean oil companies and it's use.
2593 2018-05-16 19:02:06 Super simple!
Drain, rinse, & pat dry a can of chick peas. Roast @ 425 for ~ 20 minutes. Drizzle w/olive oil & seasoning salt
Chop whatever veg you like, drizzle with oil, salt, pepper, & toss to coat. Roast @ 425 until soft
Combine & add any dressing (guac/hummus/ranch)
2594 2018-05-16 19:01:56 Waiting for this oil change will be the death of me

2598 2018-05-16 19:01:22 Hello twitter friends. We have four paintings from Haiti. Why don't you come in and check them out? They are original oil paintings with stretcher bars
2599 2018-05-16 19:01:21 ...& got back out to make good on oil deals...

2620 2018-05-16 18:59:32 I just found tea tree oil in my medicine cabinet and used it for the breakou!! I have Thayer’s rose petal witch hazel toner and use it at least before bed every night but it hasn’t seemed to help much :/ and I’ve been consistent daily for over 6 months! What about peel off masks?
2621 2018-05-16 18:59:28 Finally getting my oil changed since November...whoops
2622 2018-05-16 18:59:28 It's  was a smoke screen. To let Russia give oil to NK.. Russia is is give oil to the NK. Russia want The Korea too. But how is China getting away with building land made island in the ocean. Nobody seems to ask.
Here's some chocolate cake. .yes Xi anything u say...

2627 2018-05-16 18:58:39 Justin's Liberals funding foreign oil company Kinder Morgan to exploit Canada! Rediculous! Kinder Morgan pipeline must be stopped!
2628 2018-05-16 18:58:38 After several attempts all the oil will rub on to the squirrels fur and the pole won't be so slippery anymore thereby getting it to access the bird feeder.

2631 2018-05-16 18:58:29 The shorts I wore when changing the oil in my car are stained from oil and grease

2633 2018-05-16 18:58:26 We need an oil tank replaced.  Anyone know what the cheapest place is to work with?  Like free would be the best option....  This adult shit is for the effing birds..... 
    On a side note.... I'm looking for work as well.  Yes, I'm still tattooing.  I need dependable income.
2634 2018-05-16 18:58:24 Yeah! Give it a shot. The oil might be more cost effective in the long run too
2635 2018-05-16 18:58:20 Innovation is a greater resource than gold and oil..it is also an unlimited one.

2639 2018-05-16 18:58:04 Iant Fuckin around w. Them oil changes . They cost just as much as a 3.5 
2640 2018-05-16 18:57:52 You don’t know how to change your oil, shut up
2641 2018-05-16 18:57:50 I have seen life-changing results with our liposomal hemp oil.  Helps many people get off meds with bad side-effects.  Legal in all 50 states.  Dm me for details.
2642 2018-05-16 18:57:38 Why aren't we refining and using it in Canada?
Because the Koch brothers want it discounted so they can sell to the highest bidder.

Nationalize our oil. SCREW FOREIGN INDUSTRY!
2643 2018-05-16 18:57:37 Coconut oil works wonders too! I usually put it on my face before bed (after washing it) and I use a battery powered face washer thing. Similar to a Clarisonic but the Walmart brand (only like $8)

The Gulf War and the war in Iraq had nothing at all to do with it.

2650 2018-05-16 18:56:45 Price of oil is now about $80/barrel. Increased oil prices means increased looting with less development. As your war & strategy in fighting corruption has failed, there’s nothing that inspires hope. Nigeria has consistently failed to take its right place & may never
2651 2018-05-16 18:56:42 levels. 
For a party that claims to support oil, why did it take so long to twin Hwy 63 to Fort Mac? 
There was no balanced budget. That was a lie. They just cut needed maintenance and expansion with a growing population, and left the province with a crumbling infrastructure.
2652 2018-05-16 18:56:20 KM is not a new investment. It's an outdated investment. And if they think it's not worth doing business in Canada because we benefit too much from it, and don't risk enough,
THEY CAN LEAVE!

Nationalize our oil. THAT would benefit Canada!

2657 2018-05-16 18:55:55 From across the bunker there are many sounds coming from the kitchen. Pots and pans hitting each other, sizzling oil, coffee machines and others.

2666 2018-05-16 18:55:07 OK the majority,look up Forbes I think all of them on the rich list have something to do with oil one way or the other.

2675 2018-05-16 18:53:10 Here in lies the problem. Gas prices are set by OPEC, mostly Muslim countries in the Midd East, including Iran and a few other "shit-hole Muslim countries." When someone interferes or disrespects them, they raise the price of oil. Before Trump's term is over, you'll be paying $10

2687 2018-05-16 18:52:10 And Dems will attempt to run on reforming the justice system. Go figure.
2688 2018-05-16 18:52:09 Oil companies, wall st, giant telecoms destroying net neutrality, big pharma, billionaire tax cuts, screwing the poor - doesn't get more 'insider' than that. Hold on to the Bill of Rights and have a good day.
2689 2018-05-16 18:52:07 I'd agree but we would have to stop the car and oil cos from buying out new advancements there was a model for a flying saucer but Ford bought the guy out and threatened his life so instead he made levitating earth alarm clocks
2690 2018-05-16 18:52:07 지금 지하주차장 걱정에 잠이 안와
2691 2018-05-16 18:52:05 People who try to schedule oil changes for 12pm don’t realize that it’s our techs lunch hour, & when I try to tell them, they say, “well, that’s the only time I’m available.” Welp, that sucks.
2692 2018-05-16 18:52:02 What would happen if we showed up on her lawn with the same arsenal?  I'm sure she would offer us tea and crumpets.
2693 2018-05-16 18:51:58 Some patients with very low tolerance seem to do well with a small sublingual dose.  Once people need more than 0.5-1ml of oil it doesn't seem to absorb in a reasonable time.  A stronger product in a different carrier would be needed.  There are some sublingual products from LPs.
2694 2018-05-16 18:51:54 If you are in Chicago and you get those little bugs with wings in yr place mix tiger balm cayenne pepper and tea tree oil THEY GONE
2695 2018-05-16 18:51:46 I fucking hate the smell of coconut oil 
2696 2018-05-16 18:51:43 That's Canadian owed oil.
2697 2018-05-16 18:51:30 NISOC, Pergas consortium sign HOA to develop Karanj oil field.
2698 2018-05-16 18:51:18 If you don’t already know, receipt paper is a GREAT oil blotting paper alt. Literally try it
2699 2018-05-16 18:51:12 Well yeah you pointed it out with #moronDon and how dumb do we have to be to put another oil executive(RT) in high office after what Halliburton Dick Cheney did with Iraq starting a war on pure lies so China and international oil corporations could control oil fields
2700 2018-05-16 18:51:11 There is no family, there are only people being manipulated by large corporations anxiously defending their self-created oil bubble.
2701 2018-05-16 18:51:04 In every race where a  #NoFossilFuelMoney candidate ran in PA, that candidate won. 

Every. Single. One.

Come Nov., millions of Pennsylvanians will be able to choose b/w candidates who are standing up to wealthy oil and gas execs & those who knowingly take money from them
2702 2018-05-16 18:50:40 Aztec Clay Mask, Apple Cider Vinegar, and Tea Tree Oil! Have you feeling amaaazinnngg
2703 2018-05-16 18:50:37 i sad goodbye to all the products i would put on my face after cleansing and coconut oil saved me
2704 2018-05-16 18:50:37 Hi, really sorry to hear this! Can I ask, if you are running out of options, have you tried looking into cannabis oil or herbs ? It may be worth a look into
2705 2018-05-16 18:50:36 "Okay!" Loki was in there so quick once that door opened, jumping right on the couch and kicking off his shoes as he lay down. Ah, it smelled just like Bucky... He smells so good; like a certain cologne and oil. Kind of similar to a mechanic.
2706 2018-05-16 18:50:33 @narendramodi 

I am feeling ashamed to say you that you are just a fake leader ..

Because why petrol disel rates are increasing man have guts an answer the citizen.

You said before that crude oil price where very less since 4 years (naseen an all ) then to we paid high rates.
2707 2018-05-16 18:50:17 Bwoy Dr. King on a roll this week... Dash weh Reparations, fling weh oil... Bootstraps him seh... No help needed...
2708 2018-05-16 18:50:14 Coconut oil as lube?  interesting..

They should really introduce sex ed for m2m in LO for real dou!
2709 2018-05-16 18:50:13 To bad he is not doing anything about the gas prices. people seem happy that our own oil production is up, yet they are charging us more and more for it.
2710 2018-05-16 18:50:10 fish oil, grape seed extract, vitamin D, may support muscle recovery.  A protein shake is also beneficial to replenish your body with the nutrients it needs to support muscle recovery.  What country are you from?

2712 2018-05-16 18:49:44 Talk is cheap...you should have done more when you were in a position to do so...especially knowing all along who you were working for...go make an oil deal.  @CillizzaCNN @RexTillersonWH
2713 2018-05-16 18:49:32 IEA Cuts 2018 Oil Demand Forecast On Soaring Oil Prices
 
"The effect of higher prices should in particular become apparent in gasoline demand in the next few months."
2714 2018-05-16 18:49:32 hey cillizza you POS!!! lets put the crosshairs directly on you!! tillerson was in over his head, go back to the oil business!! so STFU
2715 2018-05-16 18:49:28 The contentious point is that Quebec managed to reject the oil pipeline coming their direction. This issue is about the ‘need’ of a BC pipeline. You want more refineries and local jobs I’m all for that.
2716 2018-05-16 18:49:28 Canadians don't actually buy Canadian oil for the most part. Canadian oil is largely sold at a discount to US drivers while much of Canada's fuel is imported at full price from the US and other continents.  This is one reason why pipelines are so important. #cdnpoli
2717 2018-05-16 18:49:23 Not even on accident does the far left say anything. Or they blame fall of oil revenue, which is bullshit since other oil run countries not in this situation. Chavez stole billions. That’s how spiral started.
2718 2018-05-16 18:49:16 my mom payed for my cars alignment and an oil change while i was at work  blessed
2719 2018-05-16 18:49:09 Serious players are running away the #KinderMorgan pipeline faster than #oil companies from the tar sands. Maybe market demand matters? What is #business case outside of politics? #cdnpoli

2721 2018-05-16 18:48:56 Didn't know that DoFo was CEO of every oil company. The only way he could reduce gas price, as Ontario's PM, would be by lowering provincial tax... but then Ontario would lack revenues & end up with a huge debt... unless he also cuts all social services. Great plan!
2722 2018-05-16 18:48:52 Agreed...but this is when the understood masses arise...it's like a good vinaigrette. Left alone, the oil is...focus on the vinegar it holds the most flavor.Peace
2723 2018-05-16 18:48:48 They were NEVER "unarmed".They also blew up the pipeline that sent them oil from Israel. "Cut off your nose to spite your own face."
2724 2018-05-16 18:48:48 Oil and gas industry are Canada’s largest employer.
2725 2018-05-16 18:48:37 'Write' on.
2726 2018-05-16 18:48:33 Coconut oil worked for that?! I gotta try haha
2727 2018-05-16 18:48:29 Oil record high, mortgage interest record high = fed there is no inflation at this point.  
2728 2018-05-16 18:48:19 Starmer...The Snake Oil salesman.
2729 2018-05-16 18:48:11 The picture on the left.  How do you get the oil to Hudson Bay?  The headline is unclear.
2730 2018-05-16 18:48:10 Or whether or not he stands by statement he made as WWF CEO that Alberta oil sands should remain in the ground. Or why the PMO recently hired former head of Tides Canada the major finder of anti oil activists in Canada
2731 2018-05-16 18:48:07 You honestly seem to think that oil and gas is more important for human survival than a planet which gives us clean water, air, soil, food. ohhhhh myyyyyyyyy your brain is broken
2732 2018-05-16 18:47:56 Make chimichurri. Or a coriander and chillie chutney. Bunch of cilantro, green chillies, a bit of garlic, some salt, lemon juice, bit of ground cumin - grind/liquidize, cover in oil, refrigerate. You'll never look back. (Sorry, just trolling with quick recipes)
2733 2018-05-16 18:47:54 .@BCLC should make some money off this. Take bets over whether AB will actually shut the oil off to BC. My money is on yes they will. Greasy @jjhorgan
2734 2018-05-16 18:47:41 Let me gas Goldie locks up and we can ride just got her oil changed and a tune up 
2735 2018-05-16 18:47:41 They have multiple operational nuclear facilities that in a nation with a virtually unlimited oil supply. Those facilities are too small for power generation--only good for production. They never allowed inspections on the military bases where they do this work.
2736 2018-05-16 18:47:40 I like the dark oil aesthetic and the clean cartoonish style similar to your own
2737 2018-05-16 18:47:34 Not to mention exploding healthcare premiums and 100 dollar a barrel oil
2738 2018-05-16 18:47:29 Don't use olive oil, it makes darker.
2739 2018-05-16 18:47:27 @BKellyGorman  and @MegTuten  can confirm I might be a Disney Princess! Like I went to a pet store today while waiting for my car to get an oil change. I got to hang out with the hamsters. Humans are overrated! The hamsters understand me!
2740 2018-05-16 18:47:20 The new oil benchmark set by the @NGRSenate should be declined by FG without delay. No way!
2741 2018-05-16 18:47:17 15mm vs. 1.8bb. It's existential. I'm disappointed Israel didn't show LESS restraint.
2742 2018-05-16 18:46:53 "The Invisible Hand of the Free Markets will protect the people."
 - said some dipshit snake oil salesman in the 1800s.
2743 2018-05-16 18:46:48 Not a smart or likely, legal, move. Well, plug in hybrids and electric cars now firmly top choice. Bus seems a valid choice. Maybe Alberta will help BC lead the way in decreased oil consumption and better uptake of renewables.
2744 2018-05-16 18:46:41 How does it benefit Trudeau if it doesn't go through, built by the Canadian gov't, contractors will overcharge and do cost plus for even a styrofoam coffee cup, it'll be a nightmare, then an oil company will buy it off the Canadian gov't for pennies on the dollar
2745 2018-05-16 18:46:40 With out Oil & Natural Gas, Trinidad would be like what country? . #justhereforthecomments
2746 2018-05-16 18:46:40 Oh relax Blair, I know what a strawman is. I cant recall the part where I said all BCers must completely stop using all oil and gas products.... Do you know what the term transition means? If anyone is distracting from the discussion it is you...
2747 2018-05-16 18:46:37 Es una basura esa reforma educativa ,,, yo iba a primeros en los años 70 inició de los 80,  y soy una berenjena soy Máster en un Oil/Chemical tanker de 200 mts de eslora y sin la necesidad de esa puta reforma ,,,
2748 2018-05-16 18:46:33 That's quite a contrast to the OPEC outlook on oil, against a backdrop of American production at 89% of production outside OPEC and uncertain global economic forecast. The support structure to manage overproduction is in limbo with middle eastern diplomacy at current state.
2749 2018-05-16 18:46:31 I can’t be crazy all they talking about on in the financial news channels is @Tesla, Bitcoin, Oil new highs, and Foreign tariffs
2750 2018-05-16 18:46:31 Cost of gasoline is dictated by the market. Gas is a commodity traded like any other (oil, coffee, sugar etc) It fluctuates in price based on numerous fundamentals/Technical factors: demand, supply, Geo political. The tax on gas accounts for about 35% of the cost at the pumps
2751 2018-05-16 18:46:23 U.S. oil benchmark erases earlier losses to finish higher
2752 2018-05-16 18:46:19 To speed up hair growth, add a few drops of rosemary oil to your shampoo.
2753 2018-05-16 18:46:17 tea tree oil as a spot treatment! it'll try it out sooo quick! for cleaning ur pores, i wouldn't recommend those pore strips cuz i've heard they're actually pretty bad for ur skin when they rip it like that. witch hazel as a toner should help get the gunk out! 
2754 2018-05-16 18:46:14 The current oil-driven economy will fade. It's not "if", it's when. We shouldn't wait for the ship to sink before we build another one. Renewables are the future. Oil burns, but the sun, the oceans/rivers, the winds, geothermal will still be here. Start now.
2755 2018-05-16 18:46:00 This 'shooting people who approach our border' thing is seeming like a better idea by the minute!
2756 2018-05-16 18:45:58 Just like in real life, oil drums are not bulletproof

2758 2018-05-16 18:45:33 Yes! When I started my adventures with Iran in 1998/99 I found that its oil & gas sector (laws and mismanagement) deters frn. partners from investments anyway and beside of ILSA. ...And that was before any public revelations on Iran's covert nuclear programme

2760 2018-05-16 18:45:19 Then you went on accusing various people of being opposed to resource development...when in fact they are not opposed to resource development...only opposed to #KM. You think you know a thing or two about oil shipping...but I can guarantee you...you don't!
2761 2018-05-16 18:45:13 Is this an oil painting of the reaper and a llama
2762 2018-05-16 18:45:07 well, since he wasn't able to get the sanctions against Russia lifted and help Exxon and Putin get those billions of oil dollars, Rex figures he might as well tell a little bit of the truth.
2763 2018-05-16 18:45:06 I LOVE the pillow spray AND the soothing body oil,All of it !!
2764 2018-05-16 18:45:02 Mainly use groundnut oil, gets a higher temp without burning.
2765 2018-05-16 18:44:50 Another simplistic and completely unsupported statement. Quebec imports Saudi, Tunisian and Nigerian oil via tanker right down the St. Lawrence River and uses oil-by-rail from the US so it represents the worst of both worlds. Please feel free to try again
2766 2018-05-16 18:44:41 Yeah, we can just pretend we don't still rely on oil
2767 2018-05-16 18:44:40 Get some biro sketches into digital (prob difficult 4 me)

Or I’d like to paint them, I like the oil look
2768 2018-05-16 18:44:31 Today the price of oil is the highest it's been in 3 1/2 years. Trump was quick to blame Obama when oil spiked during his presidency. Can we blame Trump now?  I'm sure he has a million reasons why it isn't his fault. Nothing ever is.
2769 2018-05-16 18:44:30 You’re citing Shannon Watts, the public relations executive from Monsanto and big oil?

Her career has been corporate PR. But she’s definitely truthful about guns.
2770 2018-05-16 18:44:26 i hate waiting for an oil change bc it takes forever
2771 2018-05-16 18:44:20 When your dad gets olive oil out the cupboard puts it on his mushrooms and it turns out to be flavoured vodka  don’t think that will cook them 
2772 2018-05-16 18:44:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i here?
2773 2018-05-16 18:44:03 RexXonMobil was only in for the oil deals! He did his dirty business and got his out from the Donald, so he can pursue his real interest. Making the dough off of #Russia behind Americans back.
2774 2018-05-16 18:43:59 They'd have medicine if they didn't spend oil money on bombing Syria
2775 2018-05-16 18:43:57 And I love the smell of cars: diesel, gasoline, oil... gosh! But not encouraging that. Otsh, @Tesla breaking my heart.
2776 2018-05-16 18:43:56 @TheJennTracker for next time- melted chocolate plus a little coconut oil makes homemade magic shell!
2777 2018-05-16 18:43:55 What part of the economic side of a pipeline don't make sense? We export more oil, we get more tax revenue. Quite simple.

2780 2018-05-16 18:43:39 Spicy is ok but they cook everything in 5 litters of oil,  yuck. Even fish. I've eaten tastier goulash in London than in Budapest and I had quite a few 
2781 2018-05-16 18:43:38 Wu-Tang killa beez, we too much problems, no surprise, verbal high I struck oil, shampoo and all you can't help me a hole

2783 2018-05-16 18:43:33 Used coconut oil and sugar to scrub my face hoping it would lift all the whiteheads in my pores. . I scrubbed so hard the side of my nose is bleeding ... 
2784 2018-05-16 18:43:30 I found it absolutely heartbreaking palm oil needs to be banned!
2785 2018-05-16 18:43:29 Red oil is the key to hair growth.
2786 2018-05-16 18:43:26 Those wouldn't be so bad if the engine didn't get coated in antifreeze and rust. The last time I blew a head gasket was on a chevy 350. Before I pulled the head off I ran wd40 thru the intake manifold and then put cheap oil thru it with the plug out of the pan to flush/coat it
2787 2018-05-16 18:43:25 I never use palm oil what or is it used for and used by.
2788 2018-05-16 18:43:24 I had a ferret for 7 years, he only stank if not taken care of properly. Clean litter, don't give too many baths otherwise he will secret more oil to stink..
2789 2018-05-16 18:43:24 Black pepper definitely....dry and spicy. Some honey, vanilla, citrus oil and fig rolls
2790 2018-05-16 18:43:18 Should focus this on Washington....they have more than double that 400 tanker number right now and are expanding but I know only Canadian oil is bad.
2791 2018-05-16 18:43:14 Waiting for an oil change sucks 0/10 do not recommend

2793 2018-05-16 18:43:11 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
2794 2018-05-16 18:43:11 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2795 2018-05-16 18:43:07 Could always just put a drop of baby oil in it with every use. That should effectively waterproof it between cleanings.
2796 2018-05-16 18:43:05 Well until such time as we implement those alternatives we cannot live without oil and gas because humans, while resilient, still rely on food and water to survive and both of those commodities are dependent on the energy supplied by oil and gas.
2797 2018-05-16 18:43:01 Every Country should strive to be energy independent by harnessing the sun, the wind, the ocean's tides and/or water currents from rivers. Also: geothermal energy.  If we harnessed what was around us every day, we wouldn't need to drill for or ship oil nearly as much.
2798 2018-05-16 18:42:55 PSA: based on a few experiments performed today, the mass loss of hexane from most vegetable oils is ~ 0.5%. Which is roughly the same as a shot glass full of hexane for every gallon of oil. That’s insane. No more margarine in my cookies. O.o
2799 2018-05-16 18:42:53 25 gallons? 94 Liter? Yeah... Drinking 2.5-5.6 gallons (10-20 liters) of  !water! can be deadly. And then used oil? He would have been dead. Or vomiting it all over the place. Fake
2800 2018-05-16 18:42:46 The explosions in the background are from $200 barrels of Russian oil
2801 2018-05-16 18:42:39 .@JustinTrudeau 
Please, PLEASE do not subsidize Kinder Morgan. If you must cover their losses, do it in the form of a loan or by a special stock purchase so that the taxpayer will not be on the hook for the lining of an American oil company.
DON’T DO IT!!
2802 2018-05-16 18:42:37 Zegnam !!!
2803 2018-05-16 18:42:36 Better than most. 
Also, you can try masks to control the oil.
2804 2018-05-16 18:42:34 In other culinary news I switched from frying wth olive oil to coconut oil.

Much cleaner & no smoke!

Big tub cost buttons too.
2805 2018-05-16 18:42:14 You should try this, but bathe in canola oil first
2806 2018-05-16 18:42:09 They also sue against Hinkley Point C. The conclusion is always the same, (no nuclear), the rationalisations vary from case to case. 
From the 50s, neutral Austria has been the gateway for Russian Oil&Gas into western europe through the formerly sowjet company OMV.

2812 2018-05-16 18:41:11 Olive oil salt, pepper, garlic, and finish with a dab of butter. If you buy use good meat and season appropriately no A1 is needed. Hope you cooked it for longer then 1 minute on each side Opal.

2816 2018-05-16 18:40:55 It's amazing how Trump and countries whole oil companies are butt hurt by Exxon/American oil companies not sharing their technology with them conspired against Rex and totally sandbagged his SecState role. And the media helped them to a great extent.
2817 2018-05-16 18:40:55 girl, pixie glow tonic will fade ur scars in a matter of two weeks! and i also use the st ives apricot scrub in the shower then use a light oil free moisturizer afters. tea tree oil helps as well to fade scars 
2818 2018-05-16 18:40:54 I'm well aware of the facts. NO doubt Alberta contributes more than it receives, but that has nothing to do with BC and even less today given BC's strong performing economy. We all know that it it wasn't for the oil that was there before Alberta was Alberta, they'd be the poorest

2825 2018-05-16 18:40:13 I believe that all short distance travel should be powered by renewable energy. The only use for fossil fuels should be for hauling heavy loads to less accessible places when necessary.  The world's supply of oil would extend for generations if current use was limited.

2843 2018-05-16 18:38:14 Demand will only grow for oil and gas for the foreseeable future.   Canada can prosper and help the world to utilize its energy resources wisely.  Alternatively we can sit around and hope that alternatives can be developed without need for massive/crippling government subsidies.

so fuel oil is over $3.35 per gallon. i was paying $2.69 last year.

no shortage in oil production...

could it be your idiotic pursuit of war with both Iran and N. Korea? How much stock do you or your stupid sons own in the oil sector?

god, you suck
2856 2018-05-16 18:36:22 True, but if you look at RUT in mid March & April, you can see it tops out right around this time at this height. Looking at XOP, and oil, they're going to tip and bring SPX down too. Could be a week or so, but that's my take.
2857 2018-05-16 18:36:03 come on homie, rub some hot oil into my back dude. bro, its killing me. i'm in pain dude. gimme a little massage man cmon.

2859 2018-05-16 18:36:00 Humans are resilient, we will find a way to continue life without relying on oil and gas.  But we will cannot continue living without a healthy planet and functioning ecosystems.
2860 2018-05-16 18:35:53 Even if it passes, it doesn’t mean anything. It won’t pass the House and trump would veto it anyways. Also, doesn’t it have to have 60 votes in senate?
2861 2018-05-16 18:35:51 Okay,.... so..you know how you boil white yam and it’ll have pepper soup, then you mix the white yam with red oil and eat it with the soup??...yeah and then there was spaghetti too..... so I took some spag and some of the pepper soup and abracadabra.... it didn’t taste so bad....
2862 2018-05-16 18:35:51 I think their vegan cheese is based on coconut milk/oil but I might be wrong. Certainly tasted that way (ie not as bad as I’d feared!)

2871 2018-05-16 18:35:19 One might think that limiting American oil regulations, and restrictions on the global market would drive Arab oil prices to U.S. into the dirt. When we compete in ways they can't match in production, they've no choice but to drop prices.

2883 2018-05-16 18:34:09 @coconutcollab cheers for the free samples at London Victoria today.  My kids love them.  Recently saw a docu on palm oil and deforestation. How do you differ on the planting of your palm farms?

2891 2018-05-16 18:33:16 Big business (including Shell Oil) have moved on to renewable energies. Why is our government stuck in #dinosaurjuice land still?
2892 2018-05-16 18:33:07 Suggesting to move more oil by train, is a wonderful threat. The reality is that the need for a pipeline or bitumen reaching the west coast is to have the opportunity to threaten to sell it to someone other then Americans. If it’s southern bound, let’s just send it south.

I have to say here that I am not a military expert but a political analyst. The dispute between Iran and the rest of the countries is mainly religious. I assure you here that the first goals of any war between Saudi Arabia and Iran will be the wells of oil.

2910 2018-05-16 18:31:50 I bought this spot treatment called Zapzyt years ago and it works like a charm. It’s super strong compared to most of the drugstore ones. Tea tree oil helps too but not for everyone.
2911 2018-05-16 18:31:50 Justin now giving Canadian taxpayer's money to foreign Kinder Morgan so this huge oil company can exploit Canada! Corporate Welfare in the extreme! Kinder Morgan pipeline must be stopped!
2912 2018-05-16 18:31:48 I have been making my own coffee/coconut oil scrub with lavender and tea tree oil. I use it in the shower! It can get kind of messy but girl I have NEVER had such great skin. Cleaned up my acne, my blackheads, and my dry skin issues!!!

2918 2018-05-16 18:31:01 I would suggest not using this if you have really oily skin as it contains Dimethicone which is a silicone oil/ plastic-like barrier on the outside of the skin. It traps bacteria, sebum, and impurities in your skin which could lead to increased breakouts and blackheads.

2920 2018-05-16 18:30:53 I disagree. Renewables may not bring in foreign exchange directly in the way that oils does but they can indirectly. The issue is simply how you look at it. If we opt ex to generate fuel from #RivertonDump it won’t make $ oil would but opens the door to earn through grants, etc.

2949 2018-05-16 18:28:09 Expecting politics without unethical behaviour is like expecting Jalebis without sugar and oil. Theoretically possible, practically does not work. The best we can hope for is nothing illegal. Ethics work on twitter, not in hung houses.
2950 2018-05-16 18:28:04 Sorry, nobody but losers live in California. I have some oil wells in Texas, though- (really do) but I would not sell them- they are too valuable. Wake up- you are being scammed by @theDemocrats aka communists.
2951 2018-05-16 18:27:29 Would you like me to warm up the oil or nah?

2955 2018-05-16 18:27:13 Justin and Bill on swagger...oh I'm sorry, here have our tax payers' $...let's compensate an oil company for not being able to overcome the single most obvious risk it faced.  KM should comp the feds and provinces for wasting taxpayer time and money. Who's getting my $ next boys?
2956 2018-05-16 18:27:13 Some E&P's looked good today. Bought $FANG July 20 $130 calls for 7.00 and $ARX July 20 $14 Calls for .52. If you believe higher oil prices are on the way, these look good right now after being sold off in the last week.
2957 2018-05-16 18:27:10 Brent is already near $80. If oil export ban doesn't come back, that spread will decline (WTI prolly rises). If it keeps going like this, it's only a matter of time.

Till the time our 70% consumption of energy transfered from Oil to Renewable energy, they shouldn't reduce any source of income. Just think how much money govt would save by decreasing the import of oil by 70%.

2983 2018-05-16 18:24:06 Upping it by $5 to $50.5 isn't out of proportion.

Oil price is almost $80/b. They can still save well over $20 per barrel of oil sold. That's about over$40million a day.

2987 2018-05-16 18:23:41 We don't want Alberta's oil so...they 'punish' us by withholding their oil?
2988 2018-05-16 18:23:34 Nah. Oil is the antisticky. Or something. :D
2989 2018-05-16 18:23:26 Sike na. Getting my oil changed tomorrow
2990 2018-05-16 18:23:25 One good reason is older cars can have many things go wrong. So if you are using a proper garage they will check the basics of your car whilst changing oil etc. New cars nothing should break.
2991 2018-05-16 18:23:24 I hate getting oil changes they always wanna add extra shit
2992 2018-05-16 18:23:19 US protection in response to protect from rising oil prices/reduction of Brent-WTI spread is just another way govt tries to keep the citizenry from fully comprehending their reduction in quality of life. We can't get something for nothing.

2994 2018-05-16 18:23:07 "Anyone can invest to benefit", no you need extra cash to invest in the first place & overlook the fact that pipelines leak. Good thing the Premier set up a protected area. Won't offset larger oil spills somewhere else, though. BC has the right idea. Oil burns, water is forever.
2995 2018-05-16 18:22:52 REALLY?  Gastly because? And clean energy how?? Please remember 20-25% of oil is used for fuel! The 75-80% is used in Products, plastic, fabrics. Explain how clean energy will make products??  Inform me!
2996 2018-05-16 18:22:48 If the rest of the world can refine our oil, we can.

So put the coastline at risk and lose out on billions more in revenues because "refining is hard"..  

You clearly pick out what you want to from what I'm saying.  haha.   Done here.

2998 2018-05-16 18:22:44 Do you think China's new rail line to Iran may effect the need for tar sand oil across the Pacific in tankers....Please don't invest any of my hard earned taxes into this folly...I can give you a list of better investments if you like

3013 2018-05-16 18:21:27 Watch CNY pricing of commodities.  There is a small but growing understanding on Wall Street that USD reserve status/hegemony is enforced in no small part by the USD's monopoly pricing on these.  CNY oil contract has gone better than expected & US sanctions are accelerating that
3014 2018-05-16 18:21:11 Agreed. i would need to see the fine print of this law. just thinking of potential abuses. who decides who is and isn’t terminally il? everyone is terminally ill in long run. would this open the door for snake oil salesmen to sell shady drugs to anyone under the guise of RTT?
3015 2018-05-16 18:21:06 Nestle is already doing exactly that. They are buying up underground wells in Michigan. For pennies per million gallons. Water is the new oil of our economic future. There is a war between them and Coca-cola on water ownership. Exploiting their technology to harvest water for $$$
3016 2018-05-16 18:21:03 customer told me the door was squeaky so we should get some oil and fix it, so as he leaves he opens and closes the door 3-4 times before finally walking away 
3017 2018-05-16 18:20:57 I'm surprised more ppl don't realise this. Snake oil salesmen don't invent the diseases. The best cons are built not on outright lies, but selectively twisted truths. Like the idea that repressive Islamic fundamentalism is gonna stop IDF strikes

3053 2018-05-16 18:17:44 I bake a lot of vegan stuff, and a really important vegan baking hack is that if you're using canola oil instead of butter, you should still mix the oil and sugar for as long as you would "cream" butter because otherwise the sugar molecules won't dissolve and it will be grainy

3065 2018-05-16 18:16:25 just a theory, but how your liver processes cannabis oil might depend on what/when you have been eating.  Your liver might not process 1ml of oil when you eat nothing else.  After eating edibles the conversion to 11-OH-THC is more standardized since the liver must process food.
3066 2018-05-16 18:16:23 So before Rishaug came on this AM @nielsonTSN1260 were you guys talking about a D player that was going to be signed by the Oil? Who was it? Sounded like a prospect?

I might be onto something here as Home heating Oil is only 69p a Litre!! 
3068 2018-05-16 18:16:01 Agreed. i would need to look at the fine print on this legislation. who decides who is & isn’t terminally ill? i mean, we are all slowly dying. would this open the door for snake oil salesmen to sell shady drugs to anyone under the guise of RTT? just thinking of potential abuses.

3084 2018-05-16 18:14:01 Bio oil low key expensive but I get a discount cause we sell it at my job
3085 2018-05-16 18:14:01 Sadly while politicians playing politics every quarter Nation will have to bear increase in petrol as dollar crossed Rs 68 heading toward Rs 69-70 and international oil prices heading 90 us dollar a barrel, .......why do politicians not focus on nation development 
3086 2018-05-16 18:13:56 According to the Public Accountability Initiative, the New York LCV is partly funded by at least nine oil and gas companies, some with controversial business in the state. Furthermore, a number of fossil fuel-tied executives, lawyers, and lobbyists sit on the boards of @nylcv

3088 2018-05-16 18:13:52 ....Schwarzenegger revealed in a recent interview that he planned to sue oil companies for “first-degree murder” because, according to him, they knowingly kill people. “I don’t think there’s any difference: ....you know you’re going to kill someone, it’s first-degree murder....
3089 2018-05-16 18:13:51 I'm Californian, over-priced oil is commonplace for me
3090 2018-05-16 18:13:46 I don’t understand bc doesn’t want more pipelines because they harm the environment so the Alberta legislature is helping the environment in bc by not sending more oil in the current pipeline
3091 2018-05-16 18:13:41 The amount of money oil producing African countries make yearly is enough to end extreme poverty in Africa, yet many Africans are poor.
3092 2018-05-16 18:13:34 I gotta go get an oil change and everythinglet me get upppp
3093 2018-05-16 18:13:25 But it kind of does though right? AB is suffering due to the years of shortsighteness, still a single resource economy. And approving this pipeline is the only way Notley keeps her job. What is the gameplan here? I don't want it, but we're being bent over an oil drum...#cdnpoli
3094 2018-05-16 18:13:18 Isn't that a risky thing to do, considering the volatility of oil prices, our crude output and the tension that greets an election year? Plus, 51 is still 19$ from the current 70$, so I don't think it has anything to do with ECA, PMB isn't a thieving GEJ.. 
3095 2018-05-16 18:13:16 200 pints of oil ? Like fuck he did.

3102 2018-05-16 18:11:36 You know you’re slowly becoming a responsible adult when you don’t give into a 75% off Kate Spade sale because you have an oil change to pay for.
3103 2018-05-16 18:11:34 It just takes time to learn, making many mistakes and burning the midnight oil. Hopefully one day someone will give me a job. Thanks for the comment. 
3104 2018-05-16 18:11:33 It is a good thing! Mother nature takes millions of years to make oil....
3105 2018-05-16 18:11:26 @theJagmeetSingh is right about #KinderMorgan and @RachelNotley is wrong. The pipeline is a bad project and it will benefit no one except big oil. it won't create jobs in BC or Canada and it won't benefit the economy. @NDP are against pipelines. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoil #StopKM
3106 2018-05-16 18:11:16 Serious question: Would "shutting off the taps" not a) hurt the oil industry in Alberta who profits off exports; and b) require some form of compensation from Alberta to the oil industry for the negative impact of the legislation?
3107 2018-05-16 18:11:14 Best part about my car is the gas saving. And i get free oil changes, lifetime warranty on engine & transmission

3110 2018-05-16 18:11:06 And America and the capitalist need for oil actually saved millions of otherwise illiterate tribesman in middle East from starvation and got many of them wealthy. Qatar, UAE, Kuwait... used to be desert tent camps of Bedouin nomads 50 years ago. Look at them now
3111 2018-05-16 18:11:02 O exportador recebe em BRL. O comprador paga em USD. Ceteris paribus, se o BRL está mais barato a demanda aumenta. O EXPORTADOR recebe mais BRL.

3136 2018-05-16 18:08:45 Calling Adam Larsson a second pairing defenseman while calling Hall a Hart candidate is very very wrong. Ya, Hall is a Hart candidate THIS YEAR (not in prev 6 with oil).. Larsson was second pairing in NJ, but we all know dman traditionally take more time to develop
3137 2018-05-16 18:08:39 I hear that the Saudis will be making up Iran's lost production. I think they dont want oil prices to get too high or it will be much harder to keep the production quotas
3138 2018-05-16 18:08:27 You can try washing your hands with cold water and salt. I know that helps with onion smells. Or try coconut oil .

3146 2018-05-16 18:06:56 Day 7 - we watched a video about walnut oil because the teacher was not there. It is refined for cooking and if it’s not used for that the taste is extracted from the oil it is made from only one ingredient, english walnuts and they are bought shelled already!
3147 2018-05-16 18:06:55 Use jojoba oil or castor oil (both are fine with acne prone skin!) and mix the oil with a few drops (1-2) of tea tree oil!!!! The best spot treatment around 
3148 2018-05-16 18:06:53 so i’m at jiffy lube getting my oil changed and there are three men in the waiting room with me. here’s a thread of dumb stuff they say while i’m here.
3149 2018-05-16 18:06:49 Oil not coming down .
3150 2018-05-16 18:06:28 Like last year I emailed and called the earth science department at iu everyday for a month to fix my account because I wasn't paying double tuition and they lost my scholarship from an oil company. And nobody answered the phone
3151 2018-05-16 18:06:01 Those were the days...
3152 2018-05-16 18:06:00 all I need is an oil change make it quick ppl
3153 2018-05-16 18:05:52 and your Mom,,, @ChelseaClinton left our People to Die in Benghazi.. 
and 'we the people' '''''WILL NEVER FORGET BENGHAZI''''
3154 2018-05-16 18:05:30 I remember when obama was president weren't we paying close to 5$ a gallon? So this doesn't seem out if the ordinary to me. With all Trump is doing is seems to me that it's logical that the countries that we get our oil from probably isn't very happy with him.
3155 2018-05-16 18:05:23 Oh, man. Have you tried lavender oil for relaxation?
3156 2018-05-16 18:05:18 That body oil fye already with out that added highlighter
3157 2018-05-16 18:05:14 You thought the US was your friend? More fool you.
Perhaps you missed what they did to Iraq/Libya for putting their oil on the EURO? ..... Perhaps you think they didn't notice who was on the other the other ends of those deals? .... EURO? Don't be so childish!
3158 2018-05-16 18:05:08 I perceived @NGRSenate saw that the crude oil price rose significantly and possibility of further increase. 

To avoid influx of funds into excess crude account, they quickly adjusted the oil benchmark to $51pb and added N508 billion to the budget.

When he was MD OGDCL he was thrashed by oil tankers union for cutting supplies or something. Ask anyone in my constituency about him. Those who know him despise him.

3176 2018-05-16 18:02:50 Canada uses 2 million barrels of oil a day and it produces 4 million barrels per day. But we export 3 million barrels a day at a discount to the USA Because we have no energy East pipeline. So we import a million barrels a day at top dollar.... How stupid are CDNs? VERY Stupid

3180 2018-05-16 18:02:26 Oooh ok. Links: the niacinamide clears acne and shrinks pores, Rose hip oil + ascorbyl will reduce scarring/hyperpigmentation, the hyaluronic acid will rehydrate your skin, and the retinoid in squalene will help with acne, scars, and the elasticity of the skin.

3197 2018-05-16 18:01:35 These are deliberate attempts from the Albanian party that supplied Milosevic with oil during the embargo in the 90s. From the Albanian party that caused a civil conflict and thousands dead in Albania. Masters of deceit and disorder. Shame on them, shame on who listens to them.

3218 2018-05-16 17:59:26 Enforce the law and our constitution and let KM decide whether they want to build it. No project is predicated on $120/bbl oil, as projects like these include several booms/busts over the life of the project.

3221 2018-05-16 17:59:24 Zielonka: The public don't trust economic statistics like you wouldn't trust a climate change study from an oil company. They see a conflict of interest. #lseeurope
3222 2018-05-16 17:59:19 Jagmeet how about nationalizing those oil resources instead of handing them off to these greedy pigs? Or is civil exploitation ok?

3224 2018-05-16 17:59:16 They need to start making the gas and oil guys register here since 99% of them have lived here for years and still claiming out of state residence. That would be a good start.

3236 2018-05-16 17:58:23 I don't agree with the sentiment in many of your paintings, but you're really very skilled. As a fellow artist, some questions: What size canvas do you usually use? Oil or acrylic? How long does each painting take?

3238 2018-05-16 17:58:17 Looks like all oil companies that get approvals in future will hope for protesters so they can then negotiate with government for better deals. This is approved, move protesters and build the pipeline, why are we negotiating different deals???
3239 2018-05-16 17:58:13 $XOP.V will be a good gauge for how much of a bull market for oil this will be. I wouldn't bank on a #potstocks like run to 3 bucks or anything, but I'm wondering if she catches some momentum as oil prices rise.
3240 2018-05-16 17:57:53 That’s interesting. I’ve not changed my tip at all... and I defintely use my Pencil for +6hrs a day (excluding weekends).

I hate recreational marijuana.  If they simply legalised CBD and THC in oil form, fine.
3245 2018-05-16 17:57:31 But you are fine with BILLIONS going to fight wars over oil and the poppy plant. Taxes shouldn't go to help improve everyone's lives? That everyone includes you too..

3249 2018-05-16 17:57:05 First time I went to derm for a skin check the doctor asked me if I’d ever been sunburned. I looked at her and said, “Heck yeah! I’m a Baby Boomer. Mom used to oil us up and toss us out the door in the morning and told us not to come back until dark!” 
3250 2018-05-16 17:57:00 the rising price of oil undermines its viability as an economic source of energy. This is the corner that fossil fuels are being painted into. Low price = below extraction cost. High price = uncompetitive. The trap may snap shut before the long tarsands capital lifecycle closes.

3257 2018-05-16 17:56:14 When your topic is about the market of palm oil industry and you hv to read the statistics. how it was so glorious back in the day and was one of the largest exporter but now everything is falling due to ringgit, scandal some more

3260 2018-05-16 17:55:50 it would b horrible imagining spills of oil or LNG esp. w. fire + immediate effects on human health- so close to residents but govt + corps hv zero regard f. ppl in that matter
3261 2018-05-16 17:55:48 OIL ON CANVAS JACQUES-LOUIS DAVID.
3262 2018-05-16 17:55:44 That’s incorrect. One of the reasons oil has had a hard time lifting in the past years is that when oil hit $40 , American companies ..private companies..would start drilling again and throw more oil into an over supplied market, because they needed cash flow. Lending was dead.
3263 2018-05-16 17:55:43 so I’m getting my toes done at the mall and this chick just went to pour oil on my legs but it was mf’ing acetone... like damn bitch I just waxed my legs
3264 2018-05-16 17:55:36 The bets is they blow up their own infrastructure like water/oil lines & then bitch they have no water or fuel? If 60 Jews died, would they send over tons of medical supplies or cheer in the streets like 9/11. Hamas said 50+ were member terrorists.
3265 2018-05-16 17:55:36 THE SAME THING HAPPENS EVERYTIME. THEY BLAME OIL PRICES ON OPEC, THE INTERESTS RATES GO UP AND PRICES OF GROCERIES RISE AS WELL. HOW IS THE ECONOMY SO GOOD, BUT AMERICANS AREN'T SEEING ANY RELIEF.
3266 2018-05-16 17:55:34 Fry apple slices in coconut oil with cinnamon, top with coconut cream when finished. We eat tons of eggs, chicken, bacon, sausage. Lots of roasted veggies. Veggies are so much yummier in the oven
3267 2018-05-16 17:55:30 Given the price of oil, I still contend that KM is looking for an easy way out.

They don't need us anywhere near so much as Alberta needs them.

Andrew Scheer thinks Trudeau should nationalize the oil industry to protect us from corporate profiteering.
3282 2018-05-16 17:54:30 The APC made so much noise when the price of oil was low. Now that oil is almost $80/barrel, let's see which other excuse they come up with for failing to grow the economy.

3286 2018-05-16 17:54:03 We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified.
3287 2018-05-16 17:54:02 Fed's Bullard sees oil prices remaining at these levels for a while.
3288 2018-05-16 17:53:59 Sir! Now 20% ethanol started adding in petrol such a good move but we r paying 100% for petrol & rates keep adding burden to our wallets as OMC SAYING crude oil is increasing &govt. Says the fuel prices r deregulated.
So where we go whom to say ??

3307 2018-05-16 17:52:25 Trump admin are just grifters man.  Pruitt is the worst of 'em, living the high life on the public dime.  Do it based on the oil companies you are benefiting out of office.

3310 2018-05-16 17:51:55 Oil!!!!!
3311 2018-05-16 17:51:54 I agree. There could be oil sitting around "aging" and waiting to be delivered and they will still raise prices. We can't even stop them from doing it as there is little competition. 

Hence why I detest regulating the Free Market.
3312 2018-05-16 17:51:54 Now I have idea for my oil company too

3328 2018-05-16 17:50:22 I’ve had borscht. The red kind. I’m good. And their economy was shitty, stagnant, produces low gdp/ person and had bouts of hyperinflation before sanctions and it’s still too dependent on oil. They have bigger problems than American sanctions
3329 2018-05-16 17:50:18 Hear you and agree, but we have to start getting away from oil and all it's trappings now. It's not only consuming it that is bad, it's also the oil influence in govts. around the globe that are a real problem.
3330 2018-05-16 17:50:06 It looks fantastic but you're a bit behind the curve. BBC Blue Planet II just aired this issue, and even they were years late (they could have covered it in series 1). How about using the power of NG to reveal the destruction of habitats due to palm oil?
3331 2018-05-16 17:50:04 Is it oil that we want to restrict?
3332 2018-05-16 17:49:59 They told me my engine oil looks fresh, his dumbass lying I need to change that shit. I don’t like jiffy lube
3333 2018-05-16 17:49:50 Still waiting for Trump to justify why he canceled the Iran deal. But now it starts to make sense: by pulling out of the Iran, Total can now spike the oil price.
3334 2018-05-16 17:49:43 I think we all need to be careful of how we tell people's success stories.
So I'm outchea eating my small chops then an "Aliko Oil" tanker passes by, and all I heard from a woman was "He's sucessful because Idahosa prayed for him(Dangote)". 
No. That's not "Just" why ma.
3335 2018-05-16 17:49:42 Group 1 elements are stored under oil to prevent reaction with water!
3336 2018-05-16 17:49:40 So let’s do the math. 06 Benz with 80k miles, no maintenance costs + 3 synthetic oil changes a year = $300 a year in maintenance + has. 18 Honda with 400 miles + wiper blades, brakes, tires, oil changes, gas + $3800 depreciation in the first year = nearly $5000.
3337 2018-05-16 17:49:23 Everyone is scared by the trans fats found in hydrogenated oils so the manufacturers have unfortunately switched to palm oil because it's the cheapest alternative.

3350 2018-05-16 17:47:55 Its america and the bear was sleeping in an oil field . Arrows plus rocks are basically the flint to spark it.
3351 2018-05-16 17:47:36 Becky, Jason's campaign manager, seems like a poor business decision by the Koch brothers only having one source of crude. Demand for crude in MN is flat. Capacity at our two refinery's is limited. Enbridge wants Line 3 to be bigger to get more oil to big refinery's in the gulf.

3354 2018-05-16 17:47:17 I really need an oil change and my car detailed but I’m broke and gacc taking their sweet time letting me start again 
3355 2018-05-16 17:47:08 I find taking oil more uncertain than an edible made with properly decarbed oil.  When I take straight oil, I find the results are less predictable, possibly due to some being absorbed through mucus membranes and not all being converted to 11-OH-THC.  I find edibles much smoother
3356 2018-05-16 17:47:08 The offshore oil & gas industry and how it’s regulated is complex, so it can be a challenge to find the most factual, up-to-date information. To help you get the details you need, we’re sharing facts & useful tidbits of info!

3358 2018-05-16 17:47:04 After some swagger from Notley that she's ready to turn off the taps after her Bill 12 passes legislature today, then explains bill must be proclaimed, regulations passed, negotiations made with oil shippers. 
Swagger, followed by nuance, kinda kills the swagger.
3359 2018-05-16 17:46:58 In my old car, my oil changed where a consistent $36 smhhhh
3360 2018-05-16 17:46:47 Anyways...Bouta oil my scalp 
3361 2018-05-16 17:46:37 Stop giving our money away to Trans Mountain we do not want this pipeline it is for the rich oil company so they can ship it to China .this is not in the best interest of our Nation stop lying. We shall vote you out and as far as Alberta shall never vote Liberal.
3362 2018-05-16 17:46:21 Right? Started taking fish oil because I can’t afford my salmon fix and now face is oily as all hell and breaking out. Guh.
3363 2018-05-16 17:46:19 @realDonaldTrump Obama-noncare-health insurance-STILL NOT! affordable-Still NOT replaced.    OIL and GAS prices-NOT affordable for median income hardworking Americans-We are drilling oil in US-Why is cost outrageous?  Heating homes this fall will be impossible-NOT AFFORDABLE
3364 2018-05-16 17:46:17 “Trump and Republicans gave huge tax cuts to big drug companies, big oil and other corporations, but corporations are giving back little—if anything—to working families,” said Frank Clemente, exec dir for Americans for Tax Fairness.
3365 2018-05-16 17:46:15 I could buy a bumper to bumper warranty for $2k which is less than the interest I’d pay on a new car & less than the depreciation of that car just driving off the lot. So all I’ll end up paying for is oil changes & tires. & I could get a tire warranty for $77 to eliminate that $
3366 2018-05-16 17:46:14 I started doing coconut oil treatment on my hair and now I can’t stop touching my hair it’s so SOFT

3372 2018-05-16 17:45:41 The skyrocketing price of oil has more to do with Iran, and with our suppliers south of the border than it has to do with Trudeau.  Stop the whining and grow up.
3373 2018-05-16 17:45:37 #FunFact "mighty moss" @ Moss Landing used to burn oil for power generation! Its once-through cooling system also takes in 25% of #ElkhornSlough's volume at peak, entraining millions of larvae and eggs at the bottom of the marine food chain.

3375 2018-05-16 17:45:25 Shops trynna say my engine is leaking oil but my car wasn’t even low on oil when I went and got an oil change. And I went over like 1,500 miles. Hmmm 
3376 2018-05-16 17:45:17 @ConvEspinheiro Hi there. Are you still selling your own branded olive oil?
3377 2018-05-16 17:45:17 @JustinTrudeau and @liberal_party, y'all really out here bailing out this oil company and this stupid pipeline over the people who are protesting it? This is disgraceful!
3378 2018-05-16 17:45:12 Asking Alberta oil producers why they don't just ship refined product is like asking BC logging companies why they don't just ship finished tables and chairs. It's not what the market requires.
3379 2018-05-16 17:45:05 @RachelNotley and @JustinTrudeau talk about federal jurisdiction, but they refuse to accept that BC has the RIGHT to stand up to big oil and not let #KinderMorgan go through. They also have no right to bully BC into anything. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #protecttheinlet
3380 2018-05-16 17:45:03 they use oil to produce most eletric needs using oil to produce oil
3381 2018-05-16 17:44:46 How about we realize and release free energy devices and we can move on from using oil and gas which pollute our planet. All war based on energy will no longer exist when free energy is available. This will help usher in peace and abundance for all.
3382 2018-05-16 17:44:43 what if oil me up scooby
3383 2018-05-16 17:44:38 Makes sense from a 'Fundamental' perspective too. As I've been saying repeatedly, Oil is being propped up to maintain/increase inflation expectations to justify higher rates and QT but also boosts bond yields also, avoiding an inverted yield curve. All falls apart this Fall.
3384 2018-05-16 17:44:22 Well, we could always emulate the most unregulated regimes but I doubt we'd want to do aim for third-world status to make the oil industry happy. Global capex in the oil industry declined precipitously after the mid-2014 price plummet and is just beginning to come back.
3385 2018-05-16 17:44:10 Y’all...avocado chicken salad is where it’s at. Shredded chicken+ avocado+cilantro+olive oil+ lemon juice. Thank me later.
3386 2018-05-16 17:44:08 ever tried revoline in the oil?
3387 2018-05-16 17:43:59 yup all of this so a texas oil company...clinging to life in the new age of climate change can make some more $ for its shareholders -- thx @JustinTrudeau

3390 2018-05-16 17:43:43 The timeline of Middle East conflicts shows just how much the region has destabilized since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Innocent people suffering because of proxy wars, oil and power interests. Surely world leaders can do better than this?
3391 2018-05-16 17:43:38 We don't collect enough revenue from oil to pay for decommissioning costs of oil sands sites let alone transition.  FAs posted by oil companies are based on the value of in-ground resources so worthless when decommissioning is required.   We r digging a deeper hole.

3395 2018-05-16 17:43:10 There's more of us than they thought.
3396 2018-05-16 17:43:07 I think the "magic" as you like to call it, is £2billion in dodgy arab oil Money that was pumped in. Hardly an achievement. Barnet would win the league if they were handed £2billion in oil money.
3397 2018-05-16 17:43:06 I was once told by a close friend water would yield more power than oil.  I am starting to see his prophecy become a reality.  #FlintWaterCrisis

3401 2018-05-16 17:42:49 Green energy at the moment, needs fossil fuels to be built. No windmills or solar without oil.
3402 2018-05-16 17:42:46 With european nations set to buy iranian oil in euros instead of dollars you can bet your bottom dollar that the need will report iranian atrocities and an invasion to give them democracy will ensue. Fucking hate the YOU ESS A.
3403 2018-05-16 17:42:46 You do realize a 15 billion spending cut was just sent by the president right?
3404 2018-05-16 17:42:37 As in African Shea Butter? Cause I’m staring at a tub of it right now and I’m really about slap that and coconut oil on my head ASAP.
3405 2018-05-16 17:42:31 Peak oils does, indeed, seem to be a myth anytime soon. But fossil fuels are not subject to an unfettered market. Most of the world's oil is controlled by state actors, not the private sector.
3406 2018-05-16 17:42:23 I've had my 8th suspension.
Too numerous shadow banning to mention.
They have changed their system.
It says "NO, you're not shadow banned!"
Of course YOU ARE!
And I joined Twit before the election.
I was a volunteer, reporting to Trump Tower by

3407 2018-05-16 17:42:22 Literally getting paid to put oil in people’s cars then having to turn around and pay a grip for your own hurts so much
3408 2018-05-16 17:41:58 He is doing this.  Of course he is.  If he were a democrat, he'd have already been strung up and boiled in oil, tar and feathered and then the republicans would get really nasty!
3409 2018-05-16 17:41:54 America always right. Like when we overthrow Iran democrat to put Islam in power. Made it easy so we can invade them now because Islam in power. Oil much better for everyone when high.  #MAGA

3418 2018-05-16 17:41:16 Hush up because my oil changes are 89
3419 2018-05-16 17:41:13 Oh! Better informed than me then. That’s a great idea. My son is bare disapproving of palm oil. Almost as much as he is of milk.
3420 2018-05-16 17:41:13 I was hearing the cost of oil was dropping month ago
3421 2018-05-16 17:41:09 ok fam do any of y’all use #CBDoil and if so what’s your favorite/most trusted brand? for someone who has chronic pain and has never used CBD anything before would you suggest starting with oil (using in a vape with flavored e-liquids) or try gum/gummies? capsules? help
3422 2018-05-16 17:41:09 Then in Nigeria,palm oil plantation was such splendid scheme,scientifically and diligently executed that Malaysia government sent delegates to come and study it in Nigeria and obtain blueprint. Today they have overtaken Nigeria in palm oil export.#Nigeriafacts
3423 2018-05-16 17:41:05 I never put anything on my face that’s oil like that. My grandmother used to use witch hazel and that’s what I used. Natural astringent and doesn’t dry it out like that crap salicylic acid
3424 2018-05-16 17:41:00 Palm oil and two sweetners . Ehhhh nah
3425 2018-05-16 17:40:51 Would be great to see more coverage of U.S. VLCC exports. Is this going to be a trend/"thing"? (seems like yes). How far can it go? What about logistics of supplying LOOP with enough exportable oil, etc etc. Thanks!
3426 2018-05-16 17:40:43 Fully understand the problem, you want to move unrefined oil and gas and the refineries should of been built near the source, enlighten me on how I don’t understand the problem

3430 2018-05-16 17:40:00 @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau @Bill_Morneau @jimcarr_wpg @cathmckenna  Sorry but we don't need more oil.  We are moving to renewables.  You want to protect investors.  BUT......you are elected to protect the citizens who pay for any project.  Don't use our taxes to pay Texans.
3431 2018-05-16 17:39:55 crude oil rumo a $90 barril
3432 2018-05-16 17:39:54 Lets strike oil and get the fuck outta here
3433 2018-05-16 17:39:52 Obama did many things to lower oil prices which did two things
Hurt Putin
Diminish Saudi power.
Trump undid all those things.
Because he was paid to.
3434 2018-05-16 17:39:51 Notley says she won't lay out timeline for using Bill 12 to limit oil shipments to B.C. #bcpoli
3435 2018-05-16 17:39:48 Yes, Mr. Eberhart, Eric Bearden from Madera, CA. I noticed you stated oil going from 80 to 100 dollars a barrel. In my town from 85 to 90 the cheapest was 99 cents at a country ARCO. Is the correlation off in the modern translation of 3.50 a gallon?
3436 2018-05-16 17:39:31 I fear you will be very disappointed.  Everything he has done up to now has benefited him, his family, his businesses, hedge funds, corporations and the coal and oil businesses.  None of it has helped the average working guy, the working poor or middle income families.
3437 2018-05-16 17:39:19 Goodness! I thought you'd be happy that the cost for a barrel of oil is going up. What is it? Are you for the consumer or for the oil companies and their employees?
3438 2018-05-16 17:39:02 China has an enormous amount to offer and lose(Trade). NOKO sanctions maximized. China/Russia must accept a NOKO first strike by the USA as necessary.  Oil cost control is USA leverage over Russia. -> 100% de-nuclearization with Iran partnership/ underground labs dissolved.
3439 2018-05-16 17:38:57 .@vp reveals in his just released financial disclosure report that the tickets to the Indianapolis Colts game he walked out of last year were given to him by Forrest Lucas, co-founder of Lucas Oil Products. (The Colts play in Lucas Oil Stadium.)
3440 2018-05-16 17:38:43 Can you imagine if it was personal? Like if flames were coming out of their kitchen tap or a big oil spill into their living room?
3441 2018-05-16 17:38:36 Maybe he is the salesman and he is showing confidence in the product. Which now worries me it's snake oil and they are selling people normal glass!
3442 2018-05-16 17:38:26 Go oil your gun, sweetie. The grown ups will are here to take care of the real problems.
3443 2018-05-16 17:38:20 Try CBD oil everyday. That and (legit) yoga have saved my back -- I've been athletic my whole life and it's been an issue since I was a teen.

3446 2018-05-16 17:38:02 I don't, but it'll surface soon,you're too intelligent not to know this clip has being compromised, watch the video and listen to d audio sequence carefully.
3447 2018-05-16 17:37:59 The only jobs this moron created were in oil and gas despite doing everything he could do to stop oil production. Ie wind mills, solar, offshore drilling, global warming legislation and deals.
3448 2018-05-16 17:37:59 @SullyCNBC Great story on CNBC regarding Permian Basin Oil supply chain issues!
3449 2018-05-16 17:37:50 Alberta Premier Rachel Notley says if there is not progress on KM pipeline soon "I am ready and prepared to turn off the taps." Her govt.'s Bill 12 (that can limit oil shipments) will pass into law today. #bcpoli
3450 2018-05-16 17:37:49 A bang up job Lol . The only reason we're not heading into the triple digit debt , is because of oil which the NDP hates . Enjoy the socialism while you can 12 months and counting .
3451 2018-05-16 17:37:37 And more money into the oil billionaires pockets!
3452 2018-05-16 17:37:30 The guys who bought a Russian oil company and who have already admitted to bribing high US officials but didn't say who met with Trump's lawyer two days (!) after they bought it. Trump afterwards refuses to instate sanctions against said company. And you don't see a problem?
3453 2018-05-16 17:37:13 Mf charged me $60 for an oil change, I’m sick

3460 2018-05-16 17:36:16 You are in the pocket of the oil industry
3461 2018-05-16 17:36:01 More Forbes. “From that low point in 2008, U.S. oil production has grown each year to reach 9.4 million bpd in 2015 — a gain of 88% during Obama’s presidency. This is in fact the largest domestic oil production increase during any presidency in U.S. history.”
3462 2018-05-16 17:36:00 Oil looks like a mess today. It doesn't know what it wants to do. But that is quite telling. A bull shit surprise draw along with the whole "OMG Iran exports will DROP!" false narrative still floating around yet oil is stuck here and hasn't popped. Looks like weakness to me :)
3463 2018-05-16 17:35:52 All COD chairs need some oil asap
3464 2018-05-16 17:35:50 Alaska, a major oil and gas producer, is crafting its own plan to address climate change. Ideas under discussion include cuts in state emissions by 2025 and a tax on companies that emit carbon dioxide.
3465 2018-05-16 17:35:49 Alberta Government will vote on and pass Bill 12 today, according to @RachelNotley.  This is the legislation that would allow Alberta to restrict the flow of oil to BC. #ableg #abpoli #cdnpoli

Saudi Arabia gave 200 lashes and prison time to a 19 year old gang rape victim, blaming her. Why ain't you bombing them yet? Too mich oil probably. Scum.
3467 2018-05-16 17:35:22 Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose toward $80 a barrel on Tuesday after hitting its highest level since November 2014.

3469 2018-05-16 17:34:33 Was there some incredible investment by new ISPs before the net neutrality rule? Most people have one or two choices for ISPs and the prices are nearly identical.

3472 2018-05-16 17:34:08 From Forbes mag, 2016        The irony is that President Obama – who is not viewed as a friend of the oil and gas industry – has presided over rising oil production in each of the seven years he has been in office.
3473 2018-05-16 17:34:06 AB Premier @RachelNotley starts news conference saying AB will pass Bill 12 later today, the legislation that can cut off oil/gas exports to BC.
3474 2018-05-16 17:33:54 .@RachelNotley says her government will pass Bill 12 today. That would give Alberta power to cut off gas/oil shipments to BC. #bcpoli #abpoli

3480 2018-05-16 17:33:05 I go to get my oil changed but I stay for the adorable mechanic full of dad jokes and the cutes little pocket size lady selling tamales  thanks Groupon.
3481 2018-05-16 17:32:54 I really don't think someone making 6 figures (as you claimed in an earlier tweet) should comment negatively toward this.
3482 2018-05-16 17:32:50 Great to see you want to continue to give Trump a discount on our oil. Who knew you were such a supporter of Trump.
3483 2018-05-16 17:32:44 My masters used the fall in oil prices as a natural experiment (bsns cycle indicator) to check business cycle/absenteeism relationship. Idea being the vast majority of oil jobs in Norway are located in specific regions, and we have regional data for many variables of interest.
3484 2018-05-16 17:32:31 u only use the bio oil on your face?
3485 2018-05-16 17:32:22 What is Iran's level, and did we not play a role in their situation? We overthrew their PM planning to nationalize their oil industry in the 50's, supplied weapons in the Iran Contra scandle, shot down a civilian airliner, and now we are going after nonexistent WMDs.
3486 2018-05-16 17:32:16 I neeeed to go get my oil changed but there are 1000 other things I’d rather do than wait at Walmart for my oil to be changed
3487 2018-05-16 17:31:51 So I’m using an Argan Oil at the mo as a night cream/serum so I’ll do the same with this. There is a concentrated pigmentation corrector but it’s out of stock at the mo. (Good sign I think)
3488 2018-05-16 17:31:41 ‘Greasy wheels get the oil’

3489 2018-05-16 17:31:38 Bio oil x
3490 2018-05-16 17:31:25 No...you blamed the US! If you were unbiased you’d look at all the reasons and see why the country failed. Massive socialist subsidies being one of reasons why the country ran out of money, in particular when oil price crashed   Socialism is an ideology not a reality
3491 2018-05-16 17:31:19 Yes, and the FACT is you never admitted to calling the pathologically lying utterly corrupt sociopathic man-child you hitched your oil barge to for 14 months a fucking moron.
3492 2018-05-16 17:31:11 Do you have the original one?
3493 2018-05-16 17:31:03 รู้สึกไปเกาหลีปีที่แล้ว พลาดมากที่ไม่ทาลิปสติก แต่งหน้าแต่ไม่ทาลิป ทาก็ทาอ่อนๆ เป็นไงล่ะ หน้าเป็นไก่ต้มเลย ซีดจัด

ปีหน้าแก้ตัวใหม่ มีลิป 9 สี จะทาแม่งทุกสีเลยมึงคอยดู 2019 เกาหลีเจอแน่
3494 2018-05-16 17:31:01 I lived downwind of Nairn's for several years. The occasional lino reek was a genuine bonus. Sweet and aromatic. Like warm olive oil...
3495 2018-05-16 17:30:56 Wat is the work of the Samsu oil
3496 2018-05-16 17:30:56 Have you seen the video of Femi Otedola in Molue and no one knew who he was?

Well, Minta Forte Oil,  no Molue goes to Agege from Sango sir

3499 2018-05-16 17:30:36 Everyone struggles with it. I alittle bit of liquid coconut oil on a Q-tip can clean up your lines and smooth it out. I also HIGHLY suggest Stila stay all day lined. It’s a felt tip so it’s very easy to lay down a clean line the first try.

3504 2018-05-16 17:30:14 I’ll never get my car worked on by another American again.  Mexicans will give you an oil change, fix your tire, and detail your car for 20 dollars fam!

3507 2018-05-16 17:30:00 Iran's oil min says oil prices at $60-$65 per barrel "logical" says US wants high prices to boost shale production
3508 2018-05-16 17:29:50 I like it cosmetics! I have a bronzer palette or some shit. But I’m scared to use an oil on my face
3509 2018-05-16 17:29:41 16 days without sugar, oil and white bread ...Still 14 days to finish the challenge.. I lost 3 k of my weight 
3510 2018-05-16 17:29:34 Reptiles do not perspire, and do not have any oil glands
3511 2018-05-16 17:29:33 Did you fall for that edited clip Too?
3512 2018-05-16 17:29:33 Well in that sense it does, but there is no lack of available oil. Peak oil is a myth.
3513 2018-05-16 17:29:29 #IRAN’S OIL MINISTER SAYS OIL PRICES AT $60-$65 PER BARREL “LOGICAL”, SAYS U.S. WANTS HIGH PRICES TO BOOST SHALE PRODUCTION: MEHR. #OOTT
3514 2018-05-16 17:29:23 i feel like i should hot oil treat my locs and the retwist during my 8hr overnight shift.
3515 2018-05-16 17:29:17 This would help Venezuela’s problems too. They are struggling with low oil prices, once they go up, the government will have enough money to strengthen its grip again on the country.
3516 2018-05-16 17:29:15 1. From the additional revenue from Oil & Gas coz crude oil price is higher than the price assumed for the 2018 Budget.
2. By cutting back on Opex and Development Expenditure 
3. May be from higher corporate tax due to higher projected profits (economy is doing well)
3517 2018-05-16 17:29:04 Chinese seem to be sticking to it so far, and Russia isn't exactly waiting outside the door with money bags and oil barrels. But yea, more needs to be done.
3518 2018-05-16 17:29:00 Will higher oil prices benefit Iran?
3519 2018-05-16 17:29:00 The heavens will shift for you today, your head will attract favour. You shall be bathed with the oil of uncommon favour from this day henceforth in Jesus name
3520 2018-05-16 17:28:56 Flirted my way to a free oil change 
3521 2018-05-16 17:28:56 I hate getting my oil change, the dudes are always like you can get this and this and this.. 20 bucks here and there like no thanks
3522 2018-05-16 17:28:34 Oil money is the only reason anybody would put up with such an awful hellscape.
3523 2018-05-16 17:28:29 I need to stop getting oil changes alone because I always end up getting more than just an oil change and spending over $100 because I suck at saying no.
3524 2018-05-16 17:28:03 Yeah I just buy them at the drugstore.  Generic life brand salmon oil. Take then with food or you might get that fishy taste in your mouth after.  A friend with the same issues put me on to them.  Plus they give you a nice shiny coat. :)  My dog gets one every day too!
3525 2018-05-16 17:27:52 If a prov that could generate resource revenue, but decides not to, should transfers reduce accordingly?

I think so

Several provinces have moratorium on fracking of oil and gas

Fracking has made the U.S. the largest producer of oil in the world

I don't agree fracking is safe
3526 2018-05-16 17:27:42 Please excuse the other replies.
3527 2018-05-16 17:27:37 Might need to change the carrier oil. Jojoba is a good one, but if that's what broke you out, might need to experiment to find one that works for you!
3528 2018-05-16 17:27:08 26.2. Paramount Oil dan Orion Oil yang di kemudian hari berupaya menaikkan harga jual minyak hingga US$8 per barel dari harga pasaran saat itu. Penggelembungan harga untuk membayar minyak sebesar 300 ribu ton itu membuat Petral rugi US$2,4 juta. #keluargasoemarno
3529 2018-05-16 17:26:55 Great my routine oil change revealed a $1500 oil leak. Being an adult sucks
3530 2018-05-16 17:26:54 I feel u... mine JUST started growing this past year. I literally had to completely stop using heat, only braiding, not dye as often, leave in conditioner at all times, lots of hair masks, argon oil, aphrogee treatments,  sulfate free shampoo, wash only like twice a week etc.
3531 2018-05-16 17:26:49 Kerch is about oil rights, doubt if few, or any complainers have ever been there?, even more so when there was trouble building the highway down the southern coast.
3532 2018-05-16 17:26:45 @JohnJayLaValle Comey is a snake oil salesmen? This president is the biggest con man in history. If you can't see that, you have no business being in a leadership role.
3533 2018-05-16 17:26:29 I’m so scared of oil painting ... i guess I’ll try it soon #life
3534 2018-05-16 17:26:23 It's gonna cost you a lot of money if you don't put some oil in the engine, and get your car looked at.
3535 2018-05-16 17:26:12 My car is so stupid. It only ever says, "WASH ME," never "CHANGE MY OIL" or "REPLACE MY TAIL LIGHT."
3536 2018-05-16 17:26:05 your body is a temple?!? more like your body is a vehicle and it needs some fuckn gas. sometimes it’s crude oil...
3537 2018-05-16 17:25:57 So NO ONE wants to go into work smelling like weed  all y’all saying take a smoke break & smoke a blunt. Where y’all work?! anywaysssss.... a vape pen with THC oil don’t have a smell 
3538 2018-05-16 17:25:49 Oh I love the ordinary. Buffet and their argan oil are lifesavers for me
3539 2018-05-16 17:25:44 The price of oil fell by a factor of 3 during the Reagan administration, at a time when the economy was twice as energy intensive as it is now.  Tragically, a generation of Americans attributed the resulting good fortune to Reagan's policies, creating the sorrows of today.
3540 2018-05-16 17:25:36 Add fish oil. Lol
3541 2018-05-16 17:25:29 Got some rose oil brewing, saved my house and my crystals, cut some papaya for lunch tomorrow. I feel so magical today
3542 2018-05-16 17:25:13 I make the best garlic bread. Dad's recipe. Heat olive oil and butter and garlic in a saucepan to the depth of about ½ inch. Not too hot, but sauté garlic. Dip sliced bread into mixture until brown and press so garlic sticks to bread. I add mozzarella on top sometimes after.

3544 2018-05-16 17:24:55 Gas is over $3 a gallon. So glad we got rid of all those regulations protecting national parks and coastlines so big oil can harvest more oil and get even richer. While our environment gets destroyed

3545 2018-05-16 17:24:54 @JamesCappleman I have reported the oil leaks from the @cta tracks at Leland and Broadway on the new sidewalks and tile work to 311. It’s progressively getting worse. Thanks for any attention to this to keep the new beautiful walkway clean.
3546 2018-05-16 17:24:52 Bc the oils aren’t dirt. Shampooing your hair doesn’t really make it clean in the traditional sense, it just removes oil. The whole reason someone would use scourgify is bc they’d be too lazy to actually shampoo their hair.

3548 2018-05-16 17:24:33 I’ve got a scar on my lower left leg for that very reason. But it was 1980 so I’m sort of over it. (The bone healed just fine too). But getting oil and sawdust out of the gaping hole... fun.
3549 2018-05-16 17:24:33 The answer is no. But what does that have to do with the events in Gaza?
3550 2018-05-16 17:24:30 Cutting back oil production doesn't create scarcity?
3551 2018-05-16 17:24:29 Time for crumpets cause ur engine is outta oil!
3552 2018-05-16 17:24:25 With a little effort.....
3553 2018-05-16 17:24:25 So if I put highlighter in body oil, will I get baked
3554 2018-05-16 17:24:24 this olive oil mayo + stone ground mustard combo really does something for me
3555 2018-05-16 17:24:22 You can speak with your doctor on this - but fish oil pills have made a big difference for me.  I take 1 1000mg capsule a day and it works wonders for brain fog, and general mood.  I really notice the difference when I don't take them.
3556 2018-05-16 17:24:21 Yes! Let's hear the truth about your Rosneft oil deal!
3557 2018-05-16 17:24:20  definitely
3558 2018-05-16 17:24:16 Use baby oil or baby oil gel and put socks on directly afterwards 
Eventually after doing this for a week or two your feet will be soft enough to suck ya toes
3559 2018-05-16 17:24:11 Only one way to ensure that EU,Russia & China dont fall afoul of US sanctions by importing oil that may have been sourced in Iran is for them to have a blanket rule any ME oil bought must be paid 4 in their respective state currencies,otherwise it big EU bank fines for using US $
3560 2018-05-16 17:24:01 One curiousity for macro guys who follow crude oil: given the violent drift in USD short term rates and the fact we are no longer in backwardation, to what extent can one attribute the cost of carry as primary driver vs. inventory expectation/demand? @ErikSTownsend @MacroVoices
3561 2018-05-16 17:23:58 I wash and remove food residue including oil, drying them up before putting them in my recycling bin.  #GreaterTorontoDay
3562 2018-05-16 17:23:52 Adolescent never ends...it just takes a little oil to bring it all out again.
3563 2018-05-16 17:23:35 $80 to fill my gas tank this morning. Thanks @realDonaldTrump for the great deals you’ve been making with our oil suppliers! $4.78 a gallon. #americalast #RussiaFirst you treasonous asshat.

3565 2018-05-16 17:23:33 @myogiadityanath sir, an INDIAN OIL petrol pump is going to be destroyed tmrw my nagar nigam allahabad uttar pradesh, they say they have to widen the road, it was one of the biggest pump of U.P.
3566 2018-05-16 17:23:32 in that case we should not use China stuff as all the missile are developed by them and or go to US all ade and arms are given by them in ade 
or use oil as Saudi funded the nuclear program. do you know surge that you take could be from Porkistan as well
3567 2018-05-16 17:23:29 Gas is over $3 a gallon. So glad we got rid of all those regulations protecting national parks and coastlines so big oil can harvest more oil and get even richer.

3569 2018-05-16 17:23:24 The US is a net exporter of oil and it didn't get that way without shale production.

3571 2018-05-16 17:23:08 Visit our booth (#1931) at the Global Petroleum Show 2018 in Calgary this June 12-14 and let's talk how Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) may help to increase recovery factor of your reservoirs.
3572 2018-05-16 17:22:56 Overwhelmed cause I know I need an oil change but don’t wanna get scammed or some shit cause I know nothing about cars 
3573 2018-05-16 17:22:54 Sure they do. Oil is important, and America has proven untrustworthy by going against the economic wellbeing of Europe. Europe will never give up its privilege, even if it means leaving the US to drown in their own shit.
3574 2018-05-16 17:22:46 school this morning, then got gas, then got breakfast, went to autozone, oil change, then lunch & now i have to get ready for my senior pics, get my lights in my car fixed and then senior pics. can today be over

3576 2018-05-16 17:22:13 you think he just raised the prices for the hell of it? lol it’s  just cuz oil is becoming more expensive and scarce in supply not trump
3577 2018-05-16 17:22:13 Yes of course that's why I put quotations around "try". There is also a vast difference between adding a talented rental to a team that is already a juggernaut. Ala late 80's Oil or 2010 Blackhawks. As opposed to current iteration of the 2018 Oilers.
3578 2018-05-16 17:22:05 Well the apple does not fall from the tree as the saying goes.

3581 2018-05-16 17:21:48 Moisturizer is your best friend. Leave in conditioners and olive oil, like the real olive oil I cook with. Definitely invest in shea moisture products they will keep u moisturized or try aunt Jackie’s hair conditioners. If u don’t have natural curls u just need to train ur hair
3582 2018-05-16 17:21:30 l hate coming to the body shop cause l feel STOOPID. l just came for 2 new tires and my oil changed and here l am an hour later getting a new engine air filter and windshield wipers. sorry dad they pressured me
3583 2018-05-16 17:21:26 Miserly.  Somewhat frugal.  Don’t like paying 10’s of thousands on taxes.  Those states mentioned I would pay no taxes. Stocks, companies, oil wells, etc give me a large writeoff.  States were the problem.  Hate paying taxes twice.
3584 2018-05-16 17:21:09 Blue-collar work may involve skilled or unskilled manufacturing, mining, sanitation, custodial work, oil field work, construction, mechanic, maintenance, warehousing... does a kid really say I want to be a janitor when I grow up and expect to raise a family on that salary?
3585 2018-05-16 17:21:02 I use Julep Cleansing Oil and then their detoxify stick on my t zone, Julep hydrating face oil, and it! Cosmetics face cream lately with an eye cream. My biggest thing is double cleanse with an oil cleanser and then a water based cleanser 
3586 2018-05-16 17:20:50 New creations today. Labneh made 2 ways, labneh globes is preserving in peanut oil and labneh spread made with oregano and chili flakes.
3587 2018-05-16 17:20:43 Oil was cheap during @BarackObama’s administration. Now w/ @realDonaldTrump oil is going up like when @43georgebush was presidente...so what’s up with this oil prices? @GOP @TheDemocrats @CNN @Twitter @business @NancyPelosi @nytimes @jack @HillaryClinton

3590 2018-05-16 17:20:35 Tillerson hollowed out the Dept of State. Tillerson was there to lift sanctions on Russia so Putin with Exon investment could drill North Sea crude oil with billions in kickbacks to Trump & self. Trump blew it, thus real reason for calling him a moron.

3601 2018-05-16 17:19:02 I love them pens! If it's good oil
3602 2018-05-16 17:19:01 The reason prices are going up is not “scarcity”. Like where have you been the last 50 years? It’s that OPEC has cut back production, lead by Saudi Arabia. OPEC actions have determined oil price since the 70s.

3612 2018-05-16 17:18:06 A few years ago the price of oil was around $ 95 US a barrel and gas was about 
$ 1.15 /liter. Now oil is at $ 70 US and gas is at $ 1.35/liter and higher. Can anyone in government or industry explain this to me?
3613 2018-05-16 17:17:58 I been delaying this oil change on my car too damn long.
3614 2018-05-16 17:17:48 Thank you!!! I have sensitive teeth too, i use sensodyn, it works great but im definitely gonna try the coconut oil hack!

3618 2018-05-16 17:17:32 He can't do anything. They are using mercenaries so they can maintain distance and plausible deniability. Their goal is to take the oil fields.
3619 2018-05-16 17:17:23 so looking back on it, writing Jesus would send oil companies to hell because they ‘don’t give a shit’ about the environment was not the cleverest thing I’ve done #GCSEs2018
3620 2018-05-16 17:17:19 @great_oil Having watched a preview I can confirm you have 'made the cut'! :-)
3621 2018-05-16 17:17:14 Good business. That includes Bale which was an anomaly. We generally get back what we pay for players when we sell them too. Add in players like Mason, Carroll, Pritchard, Livermore, Wimmer who cost zero but sold for about£50m it skews it a bit. No oil money, we have to do that
3622 2018-05-16 17:17:02 2/2
So a GREAT day he making $7500, regular day $4,500
Slow day maybe $3,000 and a lot of giveaways and leave back.
half of that goes back into expenses.
Flour, channa, oil, fresh green seasoning, labour 14-18 hour days.
this secret "doubles man wealth" is a myth.
3623 2018-05-16 17:16:53 It's not the new oil, but the new soil.
3624 2018-05-16 17:16:45 even when i did my own oil changes buying jugs from walmart it was close to $70
3625 2018-05-16 17:16:42 IF YOU ARE LIVING IN SAN MARCOS AND NOT GETTING YOUR OIL CHANGED AT THE TAKE 5 ACROSS THE STREET FROM WAL MART. YOU ARE MISSING OUT !!!! 

I’m about to go make a yelp account just so I can leave a good review

3630 2018-05-16 17:16:30 do you think scots would be better off with 100% of oil revenue or the 8% we get just now?
Just answer that very simple question which makes an arse of your case for union
3631 2018-05-16 17:16:24 We now have a glutton of oil.... WHY ARE GAS PRICES SO HIGH,  and continue to increase???

3633 2018-05-16 17:16:17 Physically I'm not doing too bad. I had my surgery on October 30th. The symptoms started about 2-3 weeks after surgery. The hot flashes have been brutal but I'm getting used to them. I'm going to try essential oil therapy for those - I've heard good reviews. 1/-
3634 2018-05-16 17:16:10 I pity Ur illiteracy. Check the term "under recoveries" of oil companies and how they were burdened by prev govt. Thanks to BJP to make oil co sustainable. Once u read this, u will understand why petrol price could not be reduced. Stop being brainwashed
3635 2018-05-16 17:16:10 exactly why $20 is trolling .. $80 pretty standard in the US for a synthetic oil change

3642 2018-05-16 17:15:14 It takes 3 to 4 years for the oil palm to fruit, but the development of the fronds into the tree occurs well before this: the import of the idiom.
3643 2018-05-16 17:15:02 I will need processor dipped in oil  after trying this, unlike you monkeys i cant digest!
3644 2018-05-16 17:14:52 I ain’t know cus the oil might fuck it up

3646 2018-05-16 17:14:40 Didn't cut taxes, didn't receive any benefit from Tax FRAUD bill, jobs being lost, oil prices going up. Yeah, GOP did a real good job of attempting to 'tank' the economy. As legislators, you all stink and need to be replaced - the sooner the better!!
3647 2018-05-16 17:14:37 There is another reason. The type of oil refineries extant in the US cannot produce a lot of diesel fuel due to the type of chemical process they use, and when they do, it's sulphur-rich.
3648 2018-05-16 17:14:36 Got My oil change yesterday- finally

3666 2018-05-16 17:11:45 Nothing embarrassing about being Champions of Europe for a 6th time. It will be marvelous. Without being financially doped with £2billion in oil money, will make it all the more real of an achievement. Not artificial & tainted like City, Chelsea & PSG's "success"

3699 2018-05-16 17:09:10 You're always prioritizing the medical line,well that's a reward fr joining politics,more reason why engineers should join politics.
3700 2018-05-16 17:09:07 just read the article Colin retweeted 12th Feb, regarding new technology to increase oil production. Red Herring? More likely there's more oil down there detected, than he is letting on
3701 2018-05-16 17:08:28 I am a cloud in the sky. I am a street puddle, slicked with car oil.

3709 2018-05-16 17:08:00 its not totally up to them, up to their trade partners. either way oil decides when it cares about news and when it doesnt
3710 2018-05-16 17:07:53 No way @Europarl_EN has the balls to switch to  and away from dollar  payments for oil. No way. It’s either a bluff or fake news.
3711 2018-05-16 17:07:41 and how do you move that oil? Where will you refine it? Your argument appears to be one of ignoring how the country really works and instead wishing for unicorns.....British Columbians have become accustomed to eating and to do that they need fossil fuels
3712 2018-05-16 17:07:33 Are you going to serpentine?
3713 2018-05-16 17:07:31 soooo, he's going to expose all the back dealings in the Russian oil games?
3714 2018-05-16 17:07:16 I sure wish he had that attitude before he started systematically destroying our State Department at the wishes of his boss, thus drastically reducing our position in the world power structure.

History will not look kindly upon Rex “Big Oil Exec” Tillerson. #GoAway
3715 2018-05-16 17:07:09 So I ask you, how are we winning? Wage growth stagnant overall, oil prices rising while we have record production/reserves, job growth slowing, hot war looming, trade wars looming, bribes in the millions taken, China paying off Trump to bail out a dangerous Chinese Co. & Scandal.
3716 2018-05-16 17:07:09 At least oil is on track to break $100 a barrel. Consolation prize?
3717 2018-05-16 17:07:07 I have a morning ritual of exercise, reading, listen to podcast, @NaturesUltra CBD oil, and sitting on my patio for quiet time. It relaxes my mind and usually i can have a calm day.
3718 2018-05-16 17:07:03 I'm giving away free oil changes everyday after 11... don't miss out on em :)
3719 2018-05-16 17:06:58 I didn’t have to get an oil change bless
3720 2018-05-16 17:06:58 Taxes up for the middle class, oil prices up, which will result in higher food/goods prices, higher energy prices.  Add that to wages stagnate because corporations are using the #taxscam money to benefit a few.  And what do you get #Bluewave and Ryan scared to run in 2018.
3721 2018-05-16 17:06:53 The chorus of boos for Gary Johnson at your last presidential debate (for endorsing driver’s licenses) suggests otherwise.
3722 2018-05-16 17:06:52 “most ambitious ever mod”
I know this is only Twitter, but damn.
3723 2018-05-16 17:06:52 Russia is pissed Hillary didn't win. America exports oil.
3724 2018-05-16 17:06:38 Watch out Cooper, this boi probably flosses with Red Man chew and knows how to change his F-550 hemi bud light cooled titty knocker blaster’s oil under 45 seconds 
3725 2018-05-16 17:06:38 You can't get the pan hot enough with butter, better to use coconut oil and then put some butter on afterwards
3726 2018-05-16 17:06:37 involves oil either directly or indirectly. So most retail prices are likely to rise by some amount. Hence, our "simple average" of prices will rise, and we'll measure inflation (in addition to relative price changes around this).
3727 2018-05-16 17:06:35 COLD HARD TRUTH:
American business is on the cusp of massive change. It looks like the electric car really is our future. What happens to our 'oil industry' even if it does perfect plant-based fuels. 3rd World may still want refined fuels but a mega investor could modernize them.
3728 2018-05-16 17:06:27 Very well put! Time to replace many, many, Republicans.
3729 2018-05-16 17:06:27 Don’t be fooled by @JustinTrudeau’s assurances that throwing money at oil spills will make the problem go away. No more than 20% of oil spills are ever cleaned up. The Pacific northwest has too many threatened and endangered species. We can’t afford an environmental catastrophe.
3730 2018-05-16 17:06:26 1973 OPEC decided that oil would be traded in US$.
The USA been printing money for 45 years with a negative balance of trade. The value of the US$ has been tied to the price of oil, Lose that and the US economy is stuffed.
Countries that tried to drop it, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Iran

3733 2018-05-16 17:06:20 @GOP has become the party of defending Obama's legacy against the best interests of Americans
3734 2018-05-16 17:06:19 Not gonna lie, I think BC standing its ground on the transmountain expansion is amazing. We don't need more pipelines in Canada. We don't need pipelines expanded. We need to move away from oil (or at the very least refine it ourselves, cause yikes).
3735 2018-05-16 17:06:17 a specific joint or in general? in general i fux wit it hardbody. they usta make a jalepeno oil lime soda called LOCO that was fiiire. also one time i drank a gang of somebodies mastercleanse which is basically just that

3743 2018-05-16 17:05:40 @FBruceWilliams  pour oil on the hard place
3744 2018-05-16 17:05:40 Sure, but if costs rise and firms want to keep their profit margins, then they'll have to raise retail prices. If the price of oil rises, then the retail prices of things which involve oil are likely to rise (though not necessarily exactly proportionately). And most prodution

I see it has just become harder ~ corruption MCD, Police, Authority, no RERA.. home is no longer .. oil price shooting high.. interest rates low. EPF low

3757 2018-05-16 17:04:02 Pres Trump had nothing to do with the gas hike at the pump. The cost of a barrel
of oil is down, last I saw was $70 per barrel. Until that price goes up, pump prices go down. We have refineries on the coast in Miss, Texas,& more. Why cant we supply our own gas?
3758 2018-05-16 17:03:29 At least you’re honest.  So as soon as the oil money arrived.  I know one thing, I wouldn’t talk shit about a football club that has more honors than the Etihad could dream of.  But that’s just me.  Enjoy Oil City.  It must be an empty feeling!

3764 2018-05-16 17:03:00 Anymore oil being moved through these water ways increases the potential for devastation. For the environment, for the economy, for the health of the people here.

3773 2018-05-16 17:02:23 realistically, what could we do though? I mean, we can barely properly help our own. They could afford to do the Petrocaribe deal bc they have oil. What we have to ask ourselves is, how did an oil-rich nation descend into poverty & chaos? Idk if we can provide the help they need.

3801 2018-05-16 17:00:02 Ridiculous to stop progress. Where would we be without commercial puppy mills? Toiling to grind our own puppy flour by hand, like our great-grandparents did, that's where. I suppose we'll have to go back to squeezing our own children for baby oil, too. No thanks, big gov.
3802 2018-05-16 17:00:00 Thank You!! Yep, no gas, no oil, low servicing! Hoping with gas cost rising, it will work out in the long run! 
3803 2018-05-16 17:00:00 My alternative would be stop importing oil and make use of what we are exporting inside our own country.  The thing about people on the west coast is they don't want the oil coming here at all, not by any means.  We don't want the risk it imposes to the area we live in.
3804 2018-05-16 16:59:59 I’m trying to teach myself to be self-sufficient. I already know how to change a tire. But I’m trying to figure out how to change my own oil. Technically, it’s super easy. However, this is a brand new car than I’m financing and I don’t want anything to go wrong with it.

3879 2018-05-16 16:52:25 Gotta go back to the African store where I had to argue with the lady who sold me bad coconut oil to return it and give me my money back y’all pray for me
3880 2018-05-16 16:52:14 Whereas you believe that in Scotland all assets are owned by the state, meaning that the state would get all profits from oil, whisky, salmon and would own people’s houses. That’s how nats talk about Scotland’s ‘wealth’. 
3881 2018-05-16 16:52:13 @elonmusk realize that they are in a secondary role, the initiative you recover it. At the time all the oil power willing to attack with false or exaggerated news to sink the action would cause benefits for you that you would automatically reinvest in the company.

3884 2018-05-16 16:51:45 If a car leaks oil you fix the leak you don't remove oil from all cars.  How about instead of treating the symptoms we start seriously looking at the causes of the issues, mental health and bullying, and fix the root of the problem. But that would be common sense.

3892 2018-05-16 16:50:50 Canada hates this proven liar and Canadians don't want their tax to be spent for a Texas oil company pipeline.
That pipeline will never succeed and British Columbians are against it.

3894 2018-05-16 16:50:15 Trump is destabilizing the middle East which affects oil prices.  Russia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia , Trump!!!!  Will make money off the rising oil prices.  Remember that Qatar person who.bought 19%of Russian oil firm?  Dontcha think Putin approved that transaction?
3895 2018-05-16 16:50:10 Keystone goes all the way Port Arthur. It absolutely delivers Alberta oil to tidewater. It’s currently doing more than 560,000 bbl/d.

3900 2018-05-16 16:49:46 Sugar is arguably far more damaging to health than olive oil and dairy fats. French and Italians eat plenty of the latter and are healthier than Brits and Americans.
3901 2018-05-16 16:49:43 Well, Russia and Saudi Arabia needed it more.  Since @realDonaldTrump won't impose Russian sanctions, they get to continue to sell oil at high prices they negotiated with the Saudis.
3902 2018-05-16 16:49:41 Yes, with a few changes. Stay away from creamy products that are hard to rinse out of locs.

It's clear this pipeline should not be built.
3953 2018-05-16 16:44:50 I guess you don’t know much about how the destination of crude oil is determined economically. Conditions and prices change.
3954 2018-05-16 16:44:39 When you get an oil change and they try to sell you crap so you just say no without even really knowing if you need it or not
3955 2018-05-16 16:44:29 All their products are paraben, mineral oil, fragrance free. They don't contain any sensitizing ingredients and are pH balanced. The owner is also super dope and listens to her customers. If people complain about packaging, etc. she'll switch up immediately. Love D.E.

3967 2018-05-16 16:43:18 i'd beg to differ.  1 contract of crude oil equals about 15,000 bushels of corn (based on 42k g of ethanol produced)  crude is up 22k while corn is up half that on an equal amount 

% change of crude is 58%, corn is up 21%.
3968 2018-05-16 16:43:15 I think the motoring cost is higher - fuel alone more like £12, and not considering tyres, oil, general wear & tear.  45p per mile reasonable approximation of cost or £31.50 for 70 miles.

So I'd say depends on company and industry, especially given where we are in the economic cycle.

3990 2018-05-16 16:41:21 Sounds nice.  In reality-wealthiest industries (pharma, financial) & big, dirty, old industries of past (oil, coal, steel) are being propped up and rewarded effectively leaving behind newer, progressive and evolved industries.

4007 2018-05-16 16:40:03 This prosecutor is an idiot.. he was meeting with legitimate business professionals not drug dealers. Turkey is not denying to buy Iranian oil and make the payments in TL or Gold.
4008 2018-05-16 16:40:00 Thomas Rutlidge went to his local park lake a couple of evenings ago and managed to sneak a couple of lovely little carp off the surface 

Mixers coated in Chilli Oil did just the trick 
4009 2018-05-16 16:39:55 Then light that toilet on fire, scatter the ashes in the ocean, build a coral reef out of those ashes, crash an oil tanker into that coral reef, clean up that oil and then sell it to millions at exorbitant prices, run it in cars to add to pollution. Ergo Fate = global warming
4010 2018-05-16 16:39:54 Wherefore, I saith unto thee my beloved son ..., For Thou are a Priest unto the most highest, and have been anointed with the oil of Mine Spirit, and sealed unto Grace for salvation, AMEN
4011 2018-05-16 16:39:48 This is the fault of anti oil people within the NDP and Green parties
4012 2018-05-16 16:39:43 Crude Oil Price Forecast: Saudi America in Play as US Exports SwellCrude oil jumped on the release of weekly EIA inventory data on Wednesday, but two-way news flow as IEA cut demand forecasts kept the bullish market in consolidatio...
4013 2018-05-16 16:39:38 no it ain't mine lmfao , im going im doing my oil rn its my sisters
4014 2018-05-16 16:39:31 I'd blame the gas companies. The last time gas prices were this high, oil was $140 a barrel. Now it is under $70 a barrel. If you think it is all because of ontario taxes, you are living in a fantasy land.

4016 2018-05-16 16:39:24 omfg these two lil kids at the oil change place are so cute. they're just watching ~mesmerized~ at the mechanics outside the window. they're pretty quiet except the hiccups
4017 2018-05-16 16:39:21 Yeah, that's been the struggle so far, because I love olive oil but I can't really do fresh salads  I should learn how to make bruschetta or something
4018 2018-05-16 16:39:14 I do have some fun stuff to talk about on a live stream tonight I would also like to do a unboxed scene of young living essential oil’s if anyone is interested
4019 2018-05-16 16:39:13 What will crude & fuel oil prices do when the maritime industry has to use # 2 diesel instead of #!6 diesel?

4021 2018-05-16 16:39:08 I’m like 800 miles over for an oil change.
4022 2018-05-16 16:39:02 Why does an oil change take 3.5 hours?
4023 2018-05-16 16:39:01 娘の寝言が最高にかわいくて悶絶してるとこ。
4024 2018-05-16 16:38:56 I had them for a month and I hated it. I had to be super careful while washing my face/taking makeup off. Can’t use oil based products near them (which is hard bc I use waterproof eyeliner). They look amazing but I rather use falsies.
4025 2018-05-16 16:38:45 Feel ko na pagtanda ko. Malapit na akong bumili ng efficascent(?) oil and other oils for my kasu-kasuan.
4026 2018-05-16 16:38:37 We are glad the senate finally passes the 2018 budget, as crude oil raises to $51/barrel
4027 2018-05-16 16:38:33 I’ve been needing my oil changed for a month now and I went and bought a new shirt instead. 
4028 2018-05-16 16:38:32 How about Oil and Gas Data? Its amazing how resistant to new entrants the industry is.
4029 2018-05-16 16:38:14 Your Audi A5 Cabriolets 2010 models should be recalled! Just spent R62k on a cam belt.. I’m so dissapointed by what I thought was a one of the best brands .. My next buy will def be a Merc! It started giving me oil consumption problems when it was a  month old
4030 2018-05-16 16:37:59 Sadly, Sarah, not just you. A business that "went to the wall" is offensive to brickies & and a sportswoman who "ran out of gas" is offensive to oil company employees. #pc #ohgrief #RightOn
4031 2018-05-16 16:37:58 “in·dem·ni·fy

Im not a cologne guy

But I would buy that
4033 2018-05-16 16:37:46 WARS for OIL!? See the hypocracy!?
4034 2018-05-16 16:37:44 The oil and gas industry needs to change the narrative of the business  we are in. We are in the business of life. @maryhmoran @EnergyDisruptor #EDU2018 #energydisruptors
4035 2018-05-16 16:37:39 @jackiekabler hi girls, I was sceptical of the cutique....OMG it’s amazing, if you think you have perfect nails think again...could we have a duo of the cuticle oil please, it’s fab xx
4036 2018-05-16 16:37:19 It doesn't matter if the oil is from Alberta, California, or the Niger delta. We should be focusing on reducing the demand for it and shifting our energy to researching and developing renewables instead!
4037 2018-05-16 16:37:16 Pity about all the oil it dumped. Been following his journey on IG.

4040 2018-05-16 16:36:57 Oil and grease come from the same barrel of sludge.
4041 2018-05-16 16:36:45 I’m watching people make bread on YouTube and I’m thinking everything would look better if it were brushed with olive oil and rosemary. Including me. 
But I might be sticky
4042 2018-05-16 16:36:43 And oil companies are successfully being sued for knowingly being complicit in global climate change.  Check recent info on Shell.

4044 2018-05-16 16:36:38 Rational people agree that fossil fuels cannot be the SUSTAINED future, but they are the future. There's no other option that matches the matter/energy ratio. Canada especially will depend deeply on fossils because it's large, cold, & sparsely populated. Oil works excellently.
4045 2018-05-16 16:36:28 And you'll have to forgive me if I don't prioritize the political opinions of a Conservative 6000km away who has no problem turning away brown migrants or turning the coastline of their province into an oil slick.

4053 2018-05-16 16:35:23 Lebanon’s Energy Minister @CesarAbikhalil reconfirms after today’s cabinet session (most likely the last one before a new cabinet is announced) that a 2nd offshore oil & gas licensing round is being prepared and will possibly be launched “by end of 2018”.
4054 2018-05-16 16:35:19 We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified.
4055 2018-05-16 16:35:12 Once again we find out how much control oil and gas companies have held in this state for years.

4057 2018-05-16 16:35:08 tbh peanut butter or olive oil on literally anything  though i guess most things you'd put them on might spoil a bit fast.
4058 2018-05-16 16:35:07 Do you just add that to the oil 
4059 2018-05-16 16:35:04 Finally, Senate Passes 2018 Budget After 6 Months, Raises Crude Oil Benchmark To $51/Barrel
4060 2018-05-16 16:34:47 Having moved to a city with low humidity, I've come to believe that waxing may be necessary to keep the jojoba oil that I use from evaporating. 1/2

 I do think it or OIL form could be the prescription of choice for hyperness
4062 2018-05-16 16:34:34 It’s like Pinky & Leather Tuscadaro are helping the Fonz bring Al’s back to life after Lavern & Shirley left for jobs at the Shot’s Brewery.
4063 2018-05-16 16:34:30 I bet our enemies are really loving what Trump and his die hard supporters are doing to America right now.  Russia is laughing their ass off and getting rich off oil prices skyrocketing because once again the Middle East has flared up. The #TrumpEffect

4066 2018-05-16 16:34:06 2.  He was making unreasonable demands from a school that doesn't have rich oil money backing it like TAMU does, and if he looks at that like he was disrespected, then I don't care.  He won't do any better there than Sumlin did.  Mark it down
4067 2018-05-16 16:34:05 Luna has a lot of different types of nutrition bars and some are really good/not toooo high in sugar. Mini bagels w/peanut butter, raisins. If you like salads at all then just add olive oil to them, lots of calories and good fats.
4068 2018-05-16 16:33:57 I wonder if the old oil paints I have are still good to use
4069 2018-05-16 16:33:52 That’s about as convincing as the war for oil
4070 2018-05-16 16:33:50 You think they've spent nothing? 42m Sanchez, 30m Sissoko, 30m Lamela, 28m Moyes, all last year. They may not be top signings but we are the sixth highest payers in the League and have finished top 3 the last 3 seasons. If we had oil money it might be easier for us...
4071 2018-05-16 16:33:49 I suppose if you stopped overthrowing the govts of these nations whenever it suits you (or whenever the oil executives tell you to) and put an end to the arch hypocrisy then it might be possible to find other allies in the region eh?
4072 2018-05-16 16:33:43 Who do you think funds scientific research?  Or is it all done for free, out of altruistic desire to better mankind?   Do you think Big Oil funds research?
4073 2018-05-16 16:33:36 I like the powder form more the bullet MCT oil fucks with my acid reflux
4074 2018-05-16 16:33:29 Vehicles that burn oil having cooling issues isn't taking days off.
4075 2018-05-16 16:33:25 You're ignoring the North American economic recession in the early 90s caused, in part, by the oil price increase.
4076 2018-05-16 16:33:23 Oil helps solve that issue - windmills and solar panels do not. No matter how many you build, we're still stuck with the fact that JA isn't producing enough of anything anyone else wants to buy. As long as that's true, we don't grow the way we want to.
4077 2018-05-16 16:33:17 So... There I am standing in dischem asking for massage oil (I need to do physio on my son's foot).... Next thing the assistant takes me to the adult section.... Lesson 1- specify age group for which massage is oil is needed

4081 2018-05-16 16:32:54 Oil slips as dollar gains, demand shows signs of weakening: NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Wednesday, as a strengthening dollar overshadowed a U.S. crude inventory report that showed domestic crude stocks falling more than expected.
4082 2018-05-16 16:32:40 Analysis: the COLLUSION between the GOP and the Oil & Gas Industry re Climate Change denials is no different than the COLLUSION between the GOP and the NRA re a refusal to entertain gun reform.
4083 2018-05-16 16:32:30 My grandma (whose 86) has a blood infection. It's a "silent killer". She wanted me to be with her for her tests this morning (to check her organs). So far so good. She will most likely make it as her blood looks way better :) Death is not for her now. Death is for........oil :)
4084 2018-05-16 16:32:30 Try it, you won’t be disappointed!! Just heat a little up in the microwave so it’s not solid, you want more of the oil consistently lol
4085 2018-05-16 16:32:30 I would never buy a luxury car in my life fuck I look like spending $500 for an oil change
4086 2018-05-16 16:32:16 Texas is half desert, half swamp and has nothing outside of cities but oil and cows. Housing is cheap so people move there, and Texans are so fed up with the government that it’s turning blue. Also, taxes are low but property taxes are sky high. Georgia is....Georgia....

4088 2018-05-16 16:32:05 Renewables can at least decrease our oil dependence and if expanded (ex: meeting more of JA's hydro potential) can clean the environment a bit, but the absolute best thing for JA would be an increase in income producing exports. That's arguably our biggest fundamental issue.
4089 2018-05-16 16:32:01 I find a little spilt vegetable oil makes things entertaining
4090 2018-05-16 16:31:44 Just did my oil change I’m dirty AF 
4091 2018-05-16 16:31:39 Some ppl and sports like oil and water

4093 2018-05-16 16:31:32 Coconut oil is the true queen we should all stan
4094 2018-05-16 16:31:25 Oil prices continue to rise only because of geopolitical reasons. 

#RegimeChange wars are the primary driver of upward oil prices. 
All supply bottlenecks are manufactured by the #DeepState.

Sanctions against #Russia force  them to rely on oil prices too!

#cdnpoli
4095 2018-05-16 16:31:23 The reason gas prices are high is totally due to Ford's friends in the Oil & Gas Industry. Prices at the pump are as high as they have ever been even though Oil prices well down. If Ford is elected and does this, Bog Oil will rub its hands and expand price into the vacuum.
4096 2018-05-16 16:31:18 GOP had another great election night again.  Where is the blue wave?  I guess it petered out again.  Reminds me of global warming and we’re gonna run out of oil!!!! @cspanwj #PJNET #TCOT #P2
4097 2018-05-16 16:31:07 Why don't ISRAEL and United States just blast IRAN and get it over with and take over the oil
4098 2018-05-16 16:31:03 Okay so at work today customers have gotten pissed at me directly for: a) a customer spilling oil all over the floor and b) the fact that it’s raining and we can’t fill your fucking propane tanks inside the store
4099 2018-05-16 16:30:54 I can't understand the logic behind  the tory policy of not supporting green energy and the research of it.
Must have something to do with their mates in the oil industry.
4100 2018-05-16 16:30:50 The carbon footprint and yet this statement is deliberately distorted by the way, I have one of the things that we talk about it. I have a lot of meetings, a lot of oil in Texas. Right?
4101 2018-05-16 16:30:47 1## Main Street- reports of a heating oil tank that let go and at least a 1/4 of the oil in the tank is in the foundation.  multiple units on scene.
4102 2018-05-16 16:30:44 I walked into a Jiffy Lube to get my oil changed (full disclosure: because my dad made me) and the office is full of middle aged men. I feel like such a badass feminist right now.  #imclearlyjokingplsdontthinkimstupidbcimsarcastic
4103 2018-05-16 16:30:44 If you give too much credit to the devil for what looks & feels like a  hostage situation, his invisible evil grip on you increases. The devil's hold slips when the oil of God's anointing on you is recognised & trusted as the escape strategy. #MessengerOfHope

4110 2018-05-16 16:30:13 One large iced coffee, an allergy pill, two Advil, peppermint essential oil on the temples, a cold compress, and 15 minute break, and I’ve now got my headache to “manageable”. Whew.
4111 2018-05-16 16:30:11 No matter which way you look at it, oil is a massive foreign exchange earner and we're a country desperately in need of that. That mitigates the environmental risk. Renewables aren't going to bring in nearly that amount of income, and that's bad news no matter how we slice it.
4112 2018-05-16 16:30:09 Found in everything from shampoo to donuts, palm oil is now the most common vegetable oil in the world and also one of the world's leading deforestation drivers. It is ruining life, now is the time to stop buying things with palm oil to save our future !
4113 2018-05-16 16:30:07 Why the hell is the road blue by save oil ??
4114 2018-05-16 16:30:06 benefits of iran deal honored. oil prices lowered and cashless goes down. anti-americanism. treasury direct disbursements americanism.

4121 2018-05-16 16:29:23 Bearish indeed. I don't think Russia is seriously going to go along with this for too long. Though since there is too much oil in the world, they might push for more pumping in June while keeping a new version of the deal intact. Just a guess out of my ass.
4122 2018-05-16 16:29:20 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
4123 2018-05-16 16:29:14 Hope all is well
4124 2018-05-16 16:29:11 When you rip up your treaty with Iran and sanction their oil, gas prices go up. That’s how.
4125 2018-05-16 16:28:57 i’m glad i’m not going to get my oil changed alone

4127 2018-05-16 16:28:56 It’s probably secondary to the West Bank thing but yes the quality of the oil is cheap mayo and even store brands taste better. @AldiUSA makes a great hummus.
4128 2018-05-16 16:28:49 I love deciem. Niacinamide, “buffet”, rosehip oil, lipoic acid & hyaluronic acid especially are my favourite products.

4130 2018-05-16 16:28:49 So you think if Alberta was its own state they'd fair better running the pipelines to get the oil to market.

You think people would still be making nearly 100k each or more.

4141 2018-05-16 16:27:49 I rather baby oil than lotion!
4142 2018-05-16 16:27:46 No,surprise since many of the big @OP donors are OIL COMPANIES!  Good thing they got that big tax reduction.

4144 2018-05-16 16:27:41 Is he doing all this to help Putin with the raise in oil prices? The whole Russian economy depends on high oil prices.
4145 2018-05-16 16:27:40 The infrastructure is for Oil

We believe in Oil because 

It has to be some sort of Oil

Infrastructure has to be Green Oil

$7 a Gallon sounds to expensive

Also we may believe in this because

We make everything from Oil
4146 2018-05-16 16:27:35 Of course he is. The Americans are making a fortune off our oil, their immigrants are pouring over our border & claiming refugee status (how do you do that from the USA), & we position unqualified women(McKenna) to easily manipulate to party line & to claim gender equality. Duped

The Saudis have been getting pressure from us and Europe since 2006 to play nice or lose business. That’s the incentive, we continue to buy oil, they fulfill human rights obligations.

4168 2018-05-16 16:25:50 knowing when parts expected lifetimes are helps. like how long waterpumps, timing kits, and cv boots are supposed to last. similar to knowing 5-8k miles per oil change. then you can plan accordingly.
4169 2018-05-16 16:25:49 Reagan raised the antique on the arms race and the Saudis pumped oil and destroyed the Russian economy. That's how we won the Cold War. The collusion between the Communist party and the Russian mafia ultimately failed

4173 2018-05-16 16:25:30 The convergence of mild oil price increases, very likely EV battery improvements to +400 mile range w quick charge or short range and affordable will make EVs an upgrade within 5 years.  But those w/o a garage won't buy. Plus these new EVs will have to be SUVs to make 20%
4174 2018-05-16 16:25:29 No Israel is the Shithole Country. They add nothing to society. Islamic Counties Give us Oil & the King of Saudi Arabia Has quite a bit of stock invested so Probably not a good thing to make them our enemy. But Israel has nothing we can gain from.
4175 2018-05-16 16:25:25 It’s for hyper pigmentation/dark spots. A tablespoon of tumeric. Teaspoon of oil(coconut or olive) and teaspoon of lemon juice. Only thing is it’s messy. Tumeric stains so wear something you don’t mind getting dirty and when the mask drys rinse off in the kitchen sink or tub.
4176 2018-05-16 16:25:25 From getting your oil changed?

4178 2018-05-16 16:25:22 I never cease to be amazed at the businesses that join FSB, Today a business near to Birmingham has joined that trains dogs to detect everything from landmines to leaking oil filled pipes and supplies all over the world incl Middle and Far East and China as well as Europe and USA
4179 2018-05-16 16:25:21 I got naps and I use the Aragan oil version of this gel and girlllll my slickbacks are A1 
4180 2018-05-16 16:25:11 As an Albertan and Canadian I can not fathom going this route. Subsidizing, once again, an American oil company!  There are alternatives which would favor Canadians, Canadian jobs and the environment without compromising our values. This is just plain wrong.
4181 2018-05-16 16:25:08 My sister wanted to make fried noodles right? So she fucking took hard ass noodles and just threw it in oil and almost burned the house down 
4182 2018-05-16 16:25:08 It’s all the 2-1 oil, now it’s all synthetic oils or sprays lol I’m only 46 and I sound like an old man! But they are a thing of the past, lost in time along with many other perfect places
4183 2018-05-16 16:25:05 Fuck I need to go get this oil change but my bed so comfortable right now
4184 2018-05-16 16:25:03 one of the first times I hooked up with my ex he had put some of his homemade deodorant (made of baking soda, coconut oil, and some other shit) on his bussy. it tasted so foul.

4194 2018-05-16 16:23:28 Dropping the car off for routine service (oil change + inspection) is always worse than when it actually has a problem. The uncertainty of how much it'll cost this time is terrible!

4197 2018-05-16 16:23:07 This is a fairly ignorant statement from someone who clearly gets their knowledge from CTV headlines and not market knowledge. US shale oil production isn’t making them energy independent. Their refineries require significant heavy oil to run properly.

I’m super excited and ready <3

4232 2018-05-16 16:19:59 Isn't that kind of the point of the Democrat/Socialist Party? 
To turn here into there!
Even though there has failed miserably
4233 2018-05-16 16:19:55 Exactly right! There is a much bigger game afoot. Take a look at how Oil Sands Royalties are structured. Sliding scale 1-9% BPO and 25-40% APO. By strangling capacity it stops expansion which fills up the pay out accounts and bumps the royalties waaay up = more $$$
4234 2018-05-16 16:19:54 Carried a big ass tray of food and oil got all over me. Now I smell like sesame chicken.
4235 2018-05-16 16:19:51 Lool I don't eat it and I hate oil. But the way you said disgusting got me wondering
4236 2018-05-16 16:19:38 You should ask yourself what side your really on because your opinion that "more pipelines = fighting climate change and reduced risk to orcas" has been bought and paid for by the oil industry, oh yea and our big industry loving government.
4237 2018-05-16 16:19:34 Ladies, never mix Que oil and Hennessy together. You gon have fun but you not gon remember nun til a week later 
4238 2018-05-16 16:19:31 How is a pipeline oppression? More jobs for all Americans. Obviously you never worked in the oil and gas industry. You would be amazed at the technology they have now. You have a better chance at being killed in a plane crash, then one of those pipelines leaking.

4257 2018-05-16 16:17:27 we got to see valkyrie drinking fuel oil and slurping down actual worms and it's safe to assume asgardian cuisine is very different from ours, so thor & loki can also eat some insane things... meanwhile poor bruce just sits there during breakfast like... wh.. w-what the fu ck...
4258 2018-05-16 16:17:22 almost due something about oil prices before we give bAck tax reform and due something with immigration and sanctuary cities then you,s be really doing something back the President 100 percent then yo will be really nailing it
4259 2018-05-16 16:17:07 Did he say that before or after the oil price plummeted? Because before it was probably true. Social mobility(the american dream) in the US is horribly low by international comparison.

4269 2018-05-16 16:16:13 I would think making sales explains most of it. Oil projects are large and thought was always about getting in on ground floor. Could be profitable for oil service companies. Lots of work there, but Total and the majors just seems to me like a bad commercial fit.

4274 2018-05-16 16:15:18 @AmbJohnBolton I know you are a warmonger and blood thirsty. But, I would strongly advise against even thinking of starting a was with Iran. Iran is NOT another Iraq or Libya. If you bite Iran, Iran will bite back hard, very hard. Are you ready for oil at $250/barrel? Is America?
4275 2018-05-16 16:15:09 High heat on your pan is key so it crisps up on the edges. First I would sprinkle some salt, then rest them on paper towel to absorb excess water for a few. Then I put some olive oil on the pan; seasoned them with salt, pepper, garlic powder, chili powder; cooked for 10-15 mins

4277 2018-05-16 16:14:55 Oil concentration and how long the other lasts longer than the other
4278 2018-05-16 16:14:49 I second this, pure tea tree oil works wonders but can be pricey. Coconut oil with a "conditioning" shampoo will work the best for people with longer hair.
4279 2018-05-16 16:14:47 I'm still hoping that new Ranger will come in at under 6 figures
4280 2018-05-16 16:14:43 if you make eggs using oil you could block me stillll
4281 2018-05-16 16:14:42 It's easy to give policy privileges, hard to take away. And as @rbf_banker pointed out too, the bet on oil prices isn't risk-free too. We'll see how this pans out in the future.
4282 2018-05-16 16:14:41 The Brits didn’t honour pledge to Jewish Palestine, parcelled off land originally earmarked for Jewish homeland.under arab threat to withhold oil. Then the boats laden with Jews escaping Nazis not allowed to land in Haifa, being forced away, so many sent back to their deaths.
4283 2018-05-16 16:14:41 Coconut oil and let it sit in your hair overnight and wash it out in the morning
4284 2018-05-16 16:14:39 Oil will raise costs. Do not assume that prices rise by the same amount. Prices will be redistributed throughout the economy dependent upon price elasticity. Inflation, which is a simple to calculate average, will only occur if monetary demand is expanded faster than output.
4285 2018-05-16 16:14:34 hideous oil
4286 2018-05-16 16:14:33 Yeah Frankie... But how about you disavow the evil that currently resides in the White House? You are a snake oil salesman through and through...
4287 2018-05-16 16:14:28 Oh yes I keep forgetting your superiority!! Norwegian oil may belong to the people, but the Norwegian state doesn't just invest in Norway.
4288 2018-05-16 16:14:27 i hate my "oil" typo
4289 2018-05-16 16:14:08 @tvcnewsng It’s an error not to budget for oil subsidies because as the price oil increases in international market, the landing cost in Nigeria will increase. #JH
4290 2018-05-16 16:14:05 No the only mistake is even being involved or allied with Israel in the first place. Let the savages fight amongst themselves for their sand and oil. And then if they get out of line we'll just bomb them the same as Japan it worked against them and it'll work again.
4291 2018-05-16 16:14:00 That moment when you realize that those pre-filled oil pens ARE strong you just literally had no clue how to inhale vapor

4296 2018-05-16 16:13:05 Expecting politics without unethical behaviour is like expecting Jalebis without sugar and oil. Theoretically possible, practically does not work. The best we can hope for is nothing illegal. Ethics work on twitter, not in hung houses.

4323 2018-05-16 16:09:54 What was funny about the speculators in mid-2008 being blamed when oil was hitting $148 was that they were net short
4324 2018-05-16 16:09:51 thank youuuuu my it has cleared up so much! bless up to oil cleansing and daily sunscreen and dedicated care
4325 2018-05-16 16:09:45 The trade-weighted EUR is down to a 4-month low, and 1% below the ECB staff assumption. Meanwhile oil prices are ~15% higher.

4328 2018-05-16 16:09:27 Ur ignorance is mind numbing & ur questions only prove how little u know about the GLOBAL sanctions that'd been imposed since 1979. Most of frozen $ came from selling a limited amount of oil to countries like South Korea, Japan, China & India (where that $ was kept).
4329 2018-05-16 16:09:26 @dpradhanbjp Can we have initiatives from Oil Ministry to make all your gas dealer network accept digital payments? Dealers still insist of cash as only medium of transaction for new or transfer cases and refills.

4333 2018-05-16 16:08:53 You know I'm right. And nibaningi in these really successful churches. After oil & min fuels, pastors are probably NIG's biggest export to Mzansi. Niyaz'fela ngabo.
4334 2018-05-16 16:08:42 Mr. President, you need to make a deal on oil. Oil. Gas prices are exorbitant
4335 2018-05-16 16:08:30 And where does your funding come from? Maybe one of those 'so called charities' that are just a front for driving Cdn oil industry out of business so they can profit by being the only game in town.

4340 2018-05-16 16:08:16 in same tenure crude oil was at about $100 per barrel what did you guys do with the money through out that period than to loot the treasury, squander our funds, put Nigeria in debt and deplete our foreign reserves. The economy suffered a great deal in the hands of PDP never again

4346 2018-05-16 16:08:05 One thing you actually didn’t hear in 2014:

The recession of 2019 will be blamed on $75 oil prices that were too high.
4347 2018-05-16 16:07:56 Iran rulers a little nuts to buck Trump who would renegotiate. Oil is paid for in dollars. Iran has not much else and their currency has collapsed. This makes them perversely dangerous...but they have no popular domestic support
4348 2018-05-16 16:07:47 getting an oil change by myself and yes i’m terrified

4355 2018-05-16 16:07:05 What's the politicians' priority, do you think, the cost at the pump or how much oil companies make?
4356 2018-05-16 16:07:01 This mama changed her oil with her boy Ain't no one tell in this girl she CANT DO ANYTHING LOL!!!
4357 2018-05-16 16:06:59 Was at the hospital all morning. Wow. The Saudis are just winging it. They have no strategy. Also US oil production didn't increase as much as I would have liked this week. That will change next week :)
4358 2018-05-16 16:06:58 at the barber shop this morning dude had all green on with white shoes and a white hat and they called him lil olive oil it was too loud in there too early then I chimed in and said young guac we couldn’t stop
4359 2018-05-16 16:06:57 From what I remember, Alberta didn't like NEP because it would have meant selling oil at less than market.  Now with Alberta getting less than market, they want Feds to step in?
4360 2018-05-16 16:06:50 OMG, what if "drain the swamp" literally meant destroying wetlands to clear the way for oil drilling? Because it sure as hell isn't that other thing....
4361 2018-05-16 16:06:50 Sounds more like you should smear some oil across your eyes, set some cars on fire, and live the life!

4365 2018-05-16 16:06:45 i don't think that is embarrassing at all, i eat chick peas with olive oil and white wine vinegar for lunch every dang day.
4366 2018-05-16 16:06:40 You are the one trying to divert attention to the real problems.  Mueller, you making money off American people. Pull out of Iran deal to make money on oil.  America was Great when we had a President that cared about America rather then his own pocket book.
4367 2018-05-16 16:06:36 The overwhelming majority of the China and India palm oil trade is already covered by strong No Deforestation policies by companies like Wilmar and GAR (why we focused on them :)
4368 2018-05-16 16:06:28 Since he successfully made the price of oil rise he is a whole lot richer thanks to that Russian deal, oh and the Chinese half billion doesn't hurt either.
4369 2018-05-16 16:06:22 Figured on retaliatory oil price increases. Ridiculous when you consider we have vast untapped oil resources of our own.

4373 2018-05-16 16:05:27 What happened? I remember paying 19.9 cents a gallon at the pump before the oil embargo of the 70s. Plus, they gave you free stuff like gift wrap.
4374 2018-05-16 16:05:24 and again, Cuba's economy is propped up by Venezuela, and the only reason Venezuela's socialist economy hasn't collapsed is oil. As soon as their oil dries up, so will their economy. China and Russia are authoritarian controlled oligarchies. Learn something please.
4375 2018-05-16 16:05:22 Maybe try putting your cream on before the oil, since it's a moisturizer and the oil and gel are both 'sealants'.
4376 2018-05-16 16:05:21 @EIAgov data: #US crude #oil imports averaged 7.6 million bpd last week, +278,000 bpd vs previous week. Over last 4 weeks, crude oil imports averaged about 8.0 million bpd, -4.3% vs year-ago period.
4377 2018-05-16 16:05:16 Venezuela failed due to an over dependence of oil. A capitalist country would have failed in the same situation. 

Oh btw look at the ten poorest countries in the world. All are capitalist. Some (Madagascar) became even poorer when they turned from socialism

4382 2018-05-16 16:04:57 Been in the Alaskan oil business for 40-years. This nation exploits more than enough oil for our needs, so we export. Oil prices on the increase, the “Independents” need $68-barrel to “frac”. They have Trump turning a “blind eye” - it's all “FAKE” $$$ and called price gouging.

4389 2018-05-16 16:04:15 I don't know. When I was working for a big oil company we had so many meetings. If Someone said that to me I would show up with the phone just so I could get the work finished that the meeting was about.

4393 2018-05-16 16:03:44 Here, an embarrassing true thing about me is that I love iceberg lettuce, like, so much that I'll just eat chunks of it with salt on it, and one of my favorite salads is just iceberg, bacon bits, carrots, defrozen peas, green onion, and maybe some blue cheese. With oil + vinegar.
4394 2018-05-16 16:03:43 I've helped with three oil changes today, good oil is a gold or light brown (almost like a beer-y colour) and used oil is almost always a very dark brown or black (I'd compare it to Coke)
4395 2018-05-16 16:03:26 I've been  pulling with coconut oil , that shit doesn't even go on my skin now.
4396 2018-05-16 16:03:08 The economy in Cuba would have long ago collapsed if not for the help of Venezuelan oil. Strong social safety nets and fiercely regulated market economy is what I'm hoping for. No socialist economic systems for me, thanks. I want social mobility while the vulnerable are cared for
4397 2018-05-16 16:03:01 China could simply buy $100bn in oil or any other commodities and re-sell. Deficit accounting issue solved but in reality nothing has really changed. Elevating the deficit absurdity to the infinity power.
4398 2018-05-16 16:03:01 @VOGCouncil Is there any advice regarding disposal of household cooking fat/oil? We currently store it in ice cream containers, but don't know what to do with it when they're full.

4400 2018-05-16 16:02:52 Why don't you talk to the snake oil salesman Trump about his corrupted white house and his love for Putin, his mentor
4401 2018-05-16 16:02:51 Steel for the pipes is coming from Russia. KM has already stated they plan on bringing in temp foreign workers for construction. Oil going to foreign markets. Risk of tanker spill would decimate entire BC coast and economy for generations and we'd be stuck with the clean up bill
4402 2018-05-16 16:02:47 He may not be an MP, but he gets an inordinate amount of media time to boost his snake oil spreadsheetery. That can't go unanswered.

4404 2018-05-16 16:02:40 Do you agree that if the price of oil rises, then the prices of things whose production process depends on oil will also rise? And then do you agree that most products in the economy depend on oil?

4414 2018-05-16 16:01:43 Thank you Kirstina for all that you do for me. You changed my oil and bought me groceries for Mother's Day. I really appreciate it. The KetoZone diet works great but the groceries are expensive. Thank you again!
4415 2018-05-16 16:01:38 Has anyone tried CBD oil?
4416 2018-05-16 16:01:36 Do not feel like going to get a oil change... where Is my man when I need em .. right I ain’t got one 
4417 2018-05-16 16:01:31 In 1938 @PopMech published an article stating that over 25,000 products could be made from hemp in oil, seed, or fibre form. #HempDay #HempDayFact

4420 2018-05-16 16:01:01 Olive oil merk apa ndeerrr?? Aku pernah pake wardah jadi greasy soalnya:(
4421 2018-05-16 16:01:00 And oil
4422 2018-05-16 16:00:57 Exactly. Everything changes for filthy oil. What hypocrites these oil-worshipping, #Tarsands bathers in Albertans are (and I don't mean all Albertans). And even after all this, these people will still attack, smear and demonise the federal Liberals. What an absolute FARCE.
4423 2018-05-16 16:00:56 @BrianLehrer The Dirt-Filled Room was installed by the Dia Foundation. There was also a piece called "The Broken Mile" that they installed in a  gallery on West Broadway.  The Dia Foundation is a project of the Schlumberger family, which made billions in the oil business.
4424 2018-05-16 16:00:53 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.
4425 2018-05-16 16:00:44 Think I’ll need extra CBD oil to calm my head today! Hahaha
4426 2018-05-16 16:00:40 Burning the midnight oil . Antipolo here I come
4427 2018-05-16 16:00:39 Remember if you're changing your own headlights, don't touch the glass. Oil from your fingers can cause cracks sooner.
4428 2018-05-16 16:00:35 I get cake flour and setlzer (which makes the batter fluffy) and make little slits in the shrimp so they don't curl up when frying them. Fry up some asparagus, sweet potato, broccoli and onions along with it. Dipping sauce is sweet chili, sesame oil and dark soy sauce.
4429 2018-05-16 16:00:32 Its happened. I now use a vape for CBD oil. Let the name calling commence.
4430 2018-05-16 16:00:30 Really think people should actually read Marx. There hasn't been one country truly Marxist. But I will remind you of the capitalist colonisation, slavery, exploitation  of people & land, famine, oil wars etc all in the name of free market economics
4431 2018-05-16 16:00:24 Here's a tip: Check your oil level every other time you fill up. The engine will be warm, and you'll remember to give it regular attention!
4432 2018-05-16 16:00:22 But does it really? Look at what we've allowed since 2002. Bombing seven countries, killing millions, all under false pretenses for the sake of banking and oil industry profits.

Sadly, I would say she represents American values perfectly.

4443 2018-05-16 15:59:28 @HondaCustSvc My local dealership performed an improper oil change (not tightening drainage plug) resulting in the engine running without oil and now having obvious issues.  What support can you provide to ensure the issue will be properly resolved and warrantied free of charge?
4444 2018-05-16 15:59:28 It can no longer be saved. US damage done. Russia is looking for a status & economic boon. Oil related? Port related? War equip? Pushing middle east toward war helps their trajectory plans.

4448 2018-05-16 15:59:10 I hope after the idiotic, hypocritical, mindless dribble over pipelines, they pull the plug on #KinderMorgan An education is needed on oil & what it does for this country & what #JustinTrudeau doesn’t do, a failure in every way. Transfer payments stop & taps turned off. #stopkm
4449 2018-05-16 15:58:58 Which is why so many people are duped into thinking something like oil can raise the average price. In the 70s we blamed 20%+ inflation on oil prices Germany had the same oil price rises and very little inflation because it kept stricter control over the cause.

4482 2018-05-16 15:55:36 Yes, you can suspend an oil into a gel solution if it does not disperse well you could use an emulsifying agent. Lipid soluble drugs tend to be better for topical absorption and often have more of a localized effect rather than throughout the body. The emulsion v dual injection..

4486 2018-05-16 15:55:19 As the volume of Alaskan oil has reduced it has been replaced by ships registered in Saudi Arabia and Liberia where the rules are far less stringent. So right now you have more, less-regulated tankers. Under @TransMtn that will likely change 3/

4496 2018-05-16 15:54:48 I'm not saying there wouldn't also be some relative price changes, but oil goes into the producing of almost everything (somehow), so the prices of almost everything will rise, and we usually call that inflation.

4506 2018-05-16 15:53:33 @politico your editor needs to be fired.  Jonathan Lesser is not an economist.  An economist would consider the externalities of both sides, and not just one.  Lesser completely ignored the pollution that comes from oil/gas production as well oil spills in his analysis.

Time is wasting.  We need to solve Oil ASAP.  Not 10 years from now....  NOW.

4512 2018-05-16 15:52:26 no, because of the quality. We suffered the low gas quality - with Shell quality is waaaay better than all other oil stations in Kosovo combined :)

4523 2018-05-16 15:50:33 Think you use more money to buy oil so you have less money to buy other things so other things fall in price to attract sales. We have a change in relative prices and no inflation.

4533 2018-05-16 15:49:35 The reason for oil prices is the haters are trying to hurt the economy. As you know I am sure; if they can hurt our economy it would be in gas prices. Look back at history.

4539 2018-05-16 15:48:46 Indeed.
I’ve read over here (to be confirmed yet) that EU is already envisaging oil imports from Iran to be paid in € instead of petro-$.
We’ll see.

4563 2018-05-16 15:47:00 Yes but your statement sounds as if they are spending money to send more Oil South which is false. Adding additional markets for Oil- Like pipelines to BC Coast does have the best interest of the Canadians.

4588 2018-05-16 15:44:41 There were many days during both pregnancies when all I wanted from the stupid restaurant was fresh vegetables and also vegetables fried in oil. I'm upset that someone took this perfectly reasonable desire and ruined both options.
4589 2018-05-16 15:44:36 Wrong. Sustainable energy is important. Oil&gas industry is destroying us. We are losing land & we are losing ppl to cancer due the toxins produced in oil &gas. My father worked his whole life in Oil&gas and died of lung cancer last October. He never smoked.
4590 2018-05-16 15:44:33 Ok, so we agree that interest doesn't really control money growth. We also agree that the way it would control it is to discourage me from borrowing. So to me the sequence goes like this: oil prices go up (say, due to monopoly), which means people have to borrow more to pay oil

4594 2018-05-16 15:44:15 You could go even further and consider that there might be a minimum viable usage rate where, below that, oil gets too expensive to extract.

4613 2018-05-16 15:42:11 Ford should know that oil prices can only go up in the long run because oil is a finite resource. The only sensible thing to do is get off oil dependence. A carbon tax will help do that. Ford's policies are plain foolish.

If the EU keeps trading with Iran and switches to pricing oil in euros,

& if all of this is profitable,

Then (maybe) the USD could lose its place as the global reserve currency. Maybe.

4668 2018-05-16 15:37:06 that doesn't even make sense. They are spiking their CBD oil with a synthetic that gets people high, and officially claiming they are not.
4669 2018-05-16 15:37:05 If you are ignorant of this fact, it shows that you do not have proper knowledge base to teach anyone about Christianity.  If you knew that Cannabis is the most sacred plant of Judaism and Christianity and hid it from others, you are evil. This oil has amazing healing properties.
4670 2018-05-16 15:36:37 I'm a doctor of nothing, but I do have a grandparent dying of cancer.

Can you make a comment on the snake oil nature of bio-photon therapy, a mystic energy feel-good exercise done by some quack practitioners?
4671 2018-05-16 15:36:34 Who are we going to fight ?  People who refuse to give us their oil ?
4672 2018-05-16 15:36:30 Any recommendations for day of oil changes in Berks county?
4673 2018-05-16 15:36:23 My acne is clear now but I have a few acne scars because my acne got really bad this school year out of no where. So I might just pick up some bio oil and see what it do over summer

4682 2018-05-16 15:35:54 @Tony_BATtista @KristiRossX @stevedolinsky on BIA is amazing. Dude talks so fast, showing his passion for pie. Looks like the Batt is reading the man's book to find Chi pizza like I will be. Finding out Batt knows pizza like he knows olive oil (Sascha of Safi last week).
4683 2018-05-16 15:35:51 Sad how misinformed you are.

That was THEIR oil money that we withheld for over 30 years and WE made money on their money!

Just imagine I bought from you, but REFUSED to pay for decades.

It was THEIR money he RELEASED!  NOT "GAVE"!
4684 2018-05-16 15:35:45 Ms. Arden was also quick to defend a racist chef, so hardly surprising she's siding with Big Oil shills in Alberta. #cdnpoli

4686 2018-05-16 15:35:33 Truth, oil/ Petro dollar verses gold standard was stupidity on America's part...but the rich have both gold and us dollars so they could care less, it's the rest of us that need to scramble for livelihood.
4687 2018-05-16 15:35:17 Palm Oil. It's everywhere, so that means it requires more land, which means that more forests will be cut down.
4688 2018-05-16 15:35:15 Sources are telling me it may be a local oil & gas company, but I'm not feeling certain enough to put that into my reporting. "Extremely expensive"? Actually, this price is a bit of a surprise.
4689 2018-05-16 15:35:08 Try Castor oil, it work very good 
4690 2018-05-16 15:34:48 Here in qatar (Oil rich) the petrol price is about Rs.86 in #lka rupees.

4699 2018-05-16 15:33:32 Use heart healthy cooking oils such as olive oil, canola oil or mustard oil. Avoid sunflower oil, safflower oil, ghee, butter, margaraine.
4700 2018-05-16 15:33:27 Once a Cuban immigrant sets foot on American soil all they have to do is claim asylum and are granted it. He wasn’t illegal but a legal immigrant who’s mother died getting him here.
4701 2018-05-16 15:33:17 i thought your shirt said “oil changes everything”
4702 2018-05-16 15:33:11 I can't believe how many people are commenting on this. 
Emma, you are a very intelligent person, make a practical solution, eg get a big fat texta & write a letter on each.  
And make sure they don't contain palm oil or you will have the death of orangutans to worry about.
4703 2018-05-16 15:33:05 @CBC @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party where is the legislation to save our planet? Paying off oil companies with tax money is more important than that?
4704 2018-05-16 15:32:56 i spent $150 on new tail lights, oil, an oil change and gas. can my graduation & grad party come faster so i actually have money for myself.
4705 2018-05-16 15:32:46 I also use an oil cleanser before the cleanser. Google “double cleansing” the oil is for the actual cleaning, the cerave is to take your skin back to pH balance. My fav oil cleanser is “vanilla clean it zero purity” but you have to buy online/amazon.

4714 2018-05-16 15:31:48 We have crude oil but we import petrol. They try to make the refinery work but the cabals that import petrol n kero wont.

Why do that when
4719 2018-05-16 15:31:05 Russia has been getting higher oil prices - a boon to its economy and therefore to Putin - and is increasing its presence and influence on the world stage while trump blunders and lurches this way and that.

One vehicle for  all needs.  

No boat, camper, car or pickup truck needed.  Only seaplane is needed.  How?  read tweets....

4738 2018-05-16 15:29:26 Relaxed hair is the easiest thing to take care of, just steam it every two weeks, roller set it and get a trim every 2-4 months depending. That’s all ya know, oh and moisturize with some argon oil.
4739 2018-05-16 15:29:13 Sadly, coal, oil & gas are the most "efficient" sources for powering "progress/growth." Our addiction is to things, ease and gratification. It will never be addressed. I suggest getting our metaphysical lives in order, because we are heading for grim times.

4764 2018-05-16 15:26:42 Wrong question, Bob.  The main question has always been:  "How many Teslas and Prius are fueled by coal and oil?"  When 2/3 of your electricity generation is fueled by fossil fuels, it would be greener to run your elctric car on powdered coal.

Answer:  short answer is .... No.  Have not done so in over 100 years, and still have not.  

Why?  

Read my tweets.  Lots of reasons.  

Costs
Materials
Weight
Lack of Synergy
System efficiency
Time to charge
Range

4820 2018-05-16 15:22:13 Yes sure. It will lower price of edible oil at retail. Plantation cost will be lower as input cost will no longer attract GST and similarly refinery cost will be lower. On trade - export tax remain, so no changes there.

4858 2018-05-16 15:18:13 So, according to the latest #EIAReport, USA exported as much crude oil last week as Iran did during April; on a daily comparison basis. 

The only difference is, Iran’s numbers make sense.

4930 2018-05-16 15:11:22 Solve the oil problem, you unplug the money going to the oil States, which include Russia, as well as terrorist States out for Jihad.  

Do you want to solve the oil problem or not?  You like millions to die for oil, or not?  Complaining does nothing.  Solving the problem does.

4932 2018-05-16 15:11:06 i’ve decided to forego real perfume altogether and just use either lavender or rose and rosehip oil
4933 2018-05-16 15:11:04 It is, but I haven’t used it to cook... mine is mixed with my body lotion, shea butter, massage oil, hair creme, hair oil...
4934 2018-05-16 15:11:02 Oh the irony.  As 45 screams "America First!", tears up trade agreements, levies tariffs, the US State department says the rest of the globe will willingly ignore their domestic needs, in order to shield the US consumer from oil price risk. You can't make this shit up...
4935 2018-05-16 15:10:47 Thank you Lisa for bringing that to people’s attention and one more thing if I may.there are millions of dollars of Iranian oil money going to Hamas in cash and weapons to encourage the violence.There will never be peace in Middle East as long as the mullahs in Iran are in power.

4947 2018-05-16 15:09:29 I don't know if the the oil manufacturers and suppliers have been given liberty on the changes if price in the commodity then how come the Karnataka election would be an interval for such changes. Does the Govt. is lying or the companies are taking people's interest as guinea pig

4953 2018-05-16 15:08:58 How sad is it that I can give up meat, dairy, processed carbs, alcohol, oil, literally anything but coffee. Like it’s the one thing I can’t go 5 days or more without

4955 2018-05-16 15:08:57 Irregardless of what Morneau says, back stopping the project, the talk in the oil fields is that KM will pull out. The reason is protestors are highly organized, funded, and they fear the present line is in jeopardy of sabotage.
4956 2018-05-16 15:08:40 Socialism has been tried in some of the most ideal test conditions.  1) Venezuela which was oil rich and flush with resources.  2) USSR which was a massive military power, flush with resources, and a workforce that bought in completely.  Both failed miserably.

4958 2018-05-16 15:08:33 Most of the evangelicals deny the sacamental teaching. Material (bread, wine, water,  oil) is not transforming by a scripture or faith. Material helps us to remind,  what Jesus did to transform our hearts. #nomagic

4961 2018-05-16 15:08:02 What is the Syrian war about?  Shia vs Sunni?

Shia - Iran - pipe line to Mediterranean 
Sunni - Saudi - pipe line to Turkey

Both want to sell oil to Europe.   Solve the oil problem, you solve the pipe problem.  Is this hard to understand?  How many people have to die for oil?
4962 2018-05-16 15:07:59 Yuck coconut oil is garbage Lol it doesn’t do anything for me only almond oil & castor oil works for me
4963 2018-05-16 15:07:49 Wow @WendyWilliams in the playing in the Jiffy Lube where I’m getting an oil change. What a horrible woman. She is so hateful and rude to Meghan Markle. Do some research.

4978 2018-05-16 15:06:20 That's odd, since the province was willing to let an oil company drill under our lake, before the oil price collapse of 2015.
4979 2018-05-16 15:06:19 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

4982 2018-05-16 15:05:56 Trump says building more oil pipe lines creates jobs and is good for business!

Note that #OPEC & allies (Russia) for almost 1.5 years have cut 1 to 1.5 mln bpd of crude #oil production, draining global & US crude inventories & then there's the perpetual geopolitical risk of supply disruption (war, rumor of war) etc, etc. #gasoline

5061 2018-05-16 14:57:55 Same problem in Louisiana. When oil goes up the economy improves and there is more cash flow. When gas goes up all their constituents scream. It is a catch 22.

5064 2018-05-16 14:57:45 Looks to me as if the Israelis are going for the biggest land grab since Hitler. If you're a Middle Eastern country and you have any natural resources, be concerned, be very concerned. I mean Lebanese oil is now Israeli and US oil, how does that work.? Shameful.
5065 2018-05-16 14:57:38 I took a USDCAD trade on the USD news, then one on the RBO, then one on the oil news, which pulled back to just touch my stop, and then a re-entry at '80.

5069 2018-05-16 14:57:17 As you know Sasol Africa Ltd and Eni, an Italian Oil & Gas Corporation, are collaborating in a project to explore for oil and gas along the Kwa-Zulu Natal coast, hoping to locate massive oil and gas reserves under the seabed at depths of between 3,800m – 4,800m. @DurbanSdcea
5070 2018-05-16 14:57:16 The only reason this is a “heated debate” is because the same disinformation folks who were behind the campaign against science that showed that cigarette smoke causes cancer & emphysema & other health issues are now working for the oil companies to lie about climate change.
5071 2018-05-16 14:57:14 My tools however were butter and oil filled coffee, meat, and meditation. They now make and advertise commercial products for each of those targeted at weight loss and appetite suppressing. At the end of the day, it's the same consumerism. Not much different than a lollipop.

5464 2018-05-16 14:27:12 Oh right, so I have a lambasting from Lord Adonis to look forward to! Should make Wednesday a brighter day. 
I'm no bleedin oil painting, but I couldn't seriously leave home in the morning with a title like that, looking like that! 
I'd have to renounce it! Or add (ish) to it. 
5465 2018-05-16 14:27:05 Canada actually proves our point. Their oil is buried in the Alberta Tar Sands which is very difficult and expensive to extract. Plus the overall economy is fairly well diversified with lots of trade in goods and services with Mexico & USA (NAFTA) and rest of the world.
5466 2018-05-16 14:27:05 Sorry, are you talking about the Texas-based company Kinder Morgan company taking foreign owned oil sands and sending it raw to foreign lands or the worldwide enviro organization that was founded in Vancouver, BC Canada? Just trying to get ahold of whose more foreign here….. 
5467 2018-05-16 14:27:04 Ooh – I seem to remember my dad using 3-in-1 oil, but I dare say WD40 is the thing nowadays? @msiggins any ideas?
5468 2018-05-16 14:27:04 Apply almond oil around the mouth to keep your lips supple and soften the lines.
5469 2018-05-16 14:27:03 Finally, the vast majority of all international oil trade is  denominated in dollars. When the value of the dollar declines against  other currencies the dollar value of a barrel of  oil increases. And recently, the weakening dollar has resulted in that upward pressure on crude.
5470 2018-05-16 14:26:58 Pipeline helps a bit. Refineries help the most & 1 of the key reasons (on top of taxes), why we pay so much at the pump.
If we refine, we don't need to send oil to Texas refineries and then back to Canada.
5471 2018-05-16 14:26:57 I will have to try that one someday David - I wish they would fry in dripping over here but more often than not it is palm oil which isn't very nice tasting.
5472 2018-05-16 14:26:55 Hi Michelle. We are driving change by removing palm oil all together which we have done in our soaps using a 100% palm-free, fully traceable and sustainable base :) - Dean

The promised oil revenue
Out of the EU 2 year ago
No pound
A new volatile currency
Austerity due to deficit, that means services slashed mercilessly and horrendous tax hikes

Hell yeah, we are better together.

People of NYC, marijuana is decriminalized if you smoke it on the street, NOT if you smoke it in a court bathroom. Please note, you will be arrested for that if caught.

5492 2018-05-16 14:25:13 Sanctions on Iran are going to increase them further. It's as if he wants the price of oil to go up. I wonder which countries benefit most from rising oil prices.

5497 2018-05-16 14:24:45 That doesn't make the product snake oil, that means the prescriber is incompetent etc. Improper use of something is the the issue, not the thing itself. A Dr. denigrating mental health treatment contributes to the stigma around mental health though.

5526 2018-05-16 14:21:44 Trump is partially responsible for oil hitting their highest levels in more than 3 years. Air strikes in Syria contributed to geopolitical tension in the M. East. Threat to restore sanctions on Iran has also raised fears about supply disruption from OPEC's 3rd biggest producer.

5531 2018-05-16 14:21:25 There is a good reason. For a very long time we remained addicted to fuel oil, certain quarters had their share of around $10 billion oil imports a year. Now, it is the age of LNG addiction. Renewables are bad for business. You see, lesser imports means lesser commission.

Petrol price was RS 85/-
Reason: Modi is increasing petrol price.

5544 2018-05-16 14:20:26 Of course I care. I think most of the "targets" set are delusional and we're further away from reliable alternatives than people think.

Trudeau, Butts, and Notley are anti oil crusaders, in spite of their words and Paula carrying their water.  Harper was clearly the opposite.

5606 2018-05-16 14:14:28 Our competitors aren’t sleeping. China is currently building more nuclear reactors than Canada has in total. Russia is recovering from the oil crisis and will keep expanding. America is only getting stronger. Canada needs to grow. You need to be strong if you want to survive.
5607 2018-05-16 14:14:27 Since 5/17 I’ve:
Wrote 4 complete MSs.
Re-written a passion project.
Learned new art mediums (oil pastels & water color.)
Learned to make maps.
Survived homeschooling my kids another year.

And, most importantly, learned to
SELF-CARE

5610 2018-05-16 14:13:57 Attending @spwlaorg meeting in London on 6th June? Look out for paper at 1440hrs describing Maersk Oil's experience of using @MagPiGlobal tech to estimate permeability from core & cuttings.
5611 2018-05-16 14:13:56 A dew years ago it was found that some health food stores were selling fake vitamin E tablets that only contained vegetable oil instead of the real thing.  how can I tell the difference?

5616 2018-05-16 14:13:02 Chavez took control of the oil companies and fired its execs and you don’t see a problem with that? Why do leftists keep saying “if” socialism was done correctly it would work.
5617 2018-05-16 14:12:59 Will do.
5618 2018-05-16 14:12:50 It could work that way too, but then we still go back to depending on other countries to survive. What I think we should be doing is, having two or three more major source of income apart from oil and we can start feom there
5619 2018-05-16 14:12:47 I wish I would have known how well coconut oil removes makeup sooner 
5620 2018-05-16 14:12:43 i asked my grandma what she would think if i married an arab dude (just to tease her) and she said "it's ok, i'll be happy for u, as long as he has oil companies" omFGDHNE
5621 2018-05-16 14:12:43 KATSINA ALA: Pork meat. Short skirts. Pounded yam. Melon balls swimming in red oil. Fish head. Beer. Loud talk. Little red Volvos. Extra passenger.
5622 2018-05-16 14:12:41 Kenny is an angry dude who knows he can only get elected by making other people angry. The mean-spirited hubris that defined the Harper gang continues. For a guy all-in on the oil sands - exactly how many pipelines did he get built in his decade in gov't? Uh-huh.
5623 2018-05-16 14:12:40 lol women dont be gettin regular oil changes or nothing, then be wondering why that check engine light on.
5624 2018-05-16 14:12:36 The taxpayer will fund some I'm sure, just as the taxpayer subsidies oil and gas.
5625 2018-05-16 14:12:27 Wow. Last night in Pennsylvania, 28 out of the 41 candidates who pledged to refuse donations from Big Oil, won. That is huge. Guess voters care more about protecting our health and families than making a bunch of oil execs rich 
5626 2018-05-16 14:12:22 Norways debt is low, which means very low debt servicing costs, which gives enough room for a full menu of social programs.
If Im not mistaken, a portion of their oil royalties goes to a piggy bank fund so when oil prices drop, the govt uses the piggy bank to keep social programs

5629 2018-05-16 14:12:05 I like to love dangerously, then I realize why I shouldn't when that oil touches my gentle tender belly!
5630 2018-05-16 14:11:57 Not yours, others. Reason I'm on fence about it all is i know unless we see massive change by consumers,nothing will change, oil will flow.  However if left so driven to attack trudeau because he's not left enough, enjoy PM scheer and gutting of Enviro regs that lpc have enacted
5631 2018-05-16 14:11:53 Probably my last massage before I go home. so why not do a 90 minute oil massage. So technically this is massage 7.5?
5632 2018-05-16 14:11:39 Your club hadn't won the league for 44 years you freak! You only started winning because you had an oil rich country pour hundreds of millions into the club. You were playing in the 3rd tier less than 20 years ago. It's amazing how short people's memories are.
5633 2018-05-16 14:11:19 พีทไม่ควรพูดแบบนี้ลูกกกกกก
5634 2018-05-16 14:11:16 Find oil somewhere else. human greed should NOT be justification for decimating the habitat of beautiful creatures who call it home.  Not to mention that the pretty much inevitable oil spill will be detrimental to tourism and other industries that work in the bight #Jeedara

5645 2018-05-16 14:10:32 Sure,if U blve there is an issue that requires investigation - Iraq (don't waste time on the oil issue, look for the more import poss)

5661 2018-05-16 14:09:05 It means that if you don't refill oil immediately you damage the engine. Immediately. Not 10 miles later.
5662 2018-05-16 14:09:05 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #foxnews We have bought cheap oil from Saudi for War Reserve, so why can't we buy cheap Steel & Alum from China for War Reserve. It would scare the hell out of China & Russia and solve the Trade problem!
5663 2018-05-16 14:08:55 Pretty clear @Bill_Morneau and the liberals are desperate, staking their entire existence on a Texas oil corporation's pipeline that will never be built.

Courts will strike the whole project down and libs will be shut out of BC next election.   #guaranteed #bcpoli #KinderMorgan

5669 2018-05-16 14:07:55 The gradual increase in crude oil prices can't immediately have obvious positive effect on our economy. Moreover inflation rate have been declining pretty fast. You have many followers please be apt with very sensitive information like this.

5685 2018-05-16 14:06:39 I mean Obama let Wall Street fill his cabinet but Trump appointed oligarchs, oil industry and wall street execs too, are you just willfully oblivious to that?
5686 2018-05-16 14:06:32 This would be noteworthy if the cream group were ingesting the same amount as the oil group. As it is, the cream group was assigned three times more. Frankly, I’m surprised it got published.

5699 2018-05-16 14:05:37 Kasunod nang big time oil price hike ngayong linggo, humihirit na ng dagdag-pasahe ang ilang operator ng jeep. Gusto rin daw nilang magkaroon ng tinatawag nilang "rush hour rate" gaya ng price surge ng mga transport network company. May report si @ivanmayrina.

5710 2018-05-16 14:04:30 Yes because monetary expansion is managed by the CB. If oil prices go up today and the CB expands the money supply then the inflation will come over a year later. If oil price rises and inflation coincide then inflation must be caused by a previous monetary expansion.
5711 2018-05-16 14:04:16 Big oil wins again! Same as it ever was.
5712 2018-05-16 14:04:07 My PCP encouraged me to try CBD oil for pain and anxiety. She said that it might help, and it certainly won't hurt. There is absolutely no THC in it, just the plant extract.
5713 2018-05-16 14:04:06 Not good morning to you as usd use an olive oil spread 
5714 2018-05-16 14:04:03 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
5715 2018-05-16 14:04:00 Honestly. If i can go back to when i got my VW. I wouldnt. Id take my ass to the closet Craigslist seller and got my dream car. Im able to pay off my car in the year but its the biggest hassle ive ever had. So have fun with your 250$ HIDs nd 400$ oil change
5716 2018-05-16 14:03:53 Interesting backdrop to Morneau presser is the climate negotiations currently on in Bonn. Aim is to increase national commitments on climate action. Meanwhile in Canada we see a desperate attempt to increase oil sands production. #TMX
5717 2018-05-16 14:03:36 @SEBGroup  we have adjusted our oil price forecast upward to an average of USD 75/barrel (Brent) in 2018 and USD 85 in 2019.  #forex #fx #brent #crude #crudeoil #oiltrading #oilprices #oilprice

5721 2018-05-16 14:03:20 Just a quick question. Are these chemical businesses cyclical? How crude oil can have an impact on their margin?

I want to make it known too

5742 2018-05-16 14:02:22 Thanks. Grabbed some of the beard shampoo, conditioner, oil, balm, brush, and comb. The girl already says it's softer in the first two weeks this time than anytime I have grown before.
5743 2018-05-16 14:02:19 Which part? Of course we know Israel is an illegal entity, it kills children regularly&steals organs,illegally in Syria,supporting Isis,oil?
5744 2018-05-16 14:02:06 Hey I literally did the same thing (drive to WI, oil change) and found out my transmission was leaking so count your blessings. My car's been in the shop for a week.

5746 2018-05-16 14:01:57 For the past 6 weeks, BN doesn't float the fuel price to benchmark with crude oil price. Now the government is subsidising to keep the same price. 

Have you ask your ex-boss how to manage it before?

5749 2018-05-16 14:01:36 You know what would be cool? If someone in the cannabis industry developed a vape pen that can actually use up all of the oil in the pen. Iʻd imagine a good 20+ hits are lost to un-vaped oil left around the edges of a cartridge. Also, disposable carts are bad for the planet.

5785 2018-05-16 13:58:44 Oil is but one commodity among many, land, labour (ie: exploitable humans) are equally important sources of imperialist extraction/colonisation.

5817 2018-05-16 13:55:24 Why target nuclear? Surely oil and coal stations are a bigger issue. Nuclear is needed as we transition to renewables
5818 2018-05-16 13:55:23 I did not link to it intentionally. Wouldn't want you to waste your time on it. I will say that I'm disappointed in Politico for running such transparent oil industry propaganda as if it were serious analysis.

5844 2018-05-16 13:52:45 Then it is the more money created that causes the inflation. So cost rises can apply pressure to expand the money supply but the monetary expansion is the cause.
If oil prices rose and there was no expansion then no inflation QED

5865 2018-05-16 13:49:28 This is one of the stranger articles I've read. It wonders why price of oil is not in line with price of $XOM blames #ETFs including $400M $JKF. Then says over 18 years $IBB outperformed $IVV by 33% for some unrelated reason.

5867 2018-05-16 13:49:24 Aligns nicely with oil futures but begs one very big question: If Venezuela falls to zero exports--entirely plausible outcome--who backstops that gap plus expected Iran sanctions crimp without higher prices instead of reverting lower?

5869 2018-05-16 13:49:15 I love it. But just for debate. If the 19% oil deal isn’t true, then all Trump was doing was a quid pro quo; Lift sanctions if Russia & Ukraine truce. That’s not a problem. So conspiracy rests on proving trump gains from oil deal. Is there proof of that beyond Steele Dossier?

5878 2018-05-16 13:47:31 Paul,,,wake up  man,,when in any universe would England ever accept a "Deal" that left it with 8% of a huge resource?
WM thinks nats are strong,they also think your NO vote was weakness,,they see you as weak,,and they are right,,they will force indy on us all when the oil runsout
5879 2018-05-16 13:47:29 Who do you blame for sitting in traffic?
Who do you blame for sending money to terrorists via oil?
Who do you blame for people dying in car/airplane crashes?  
Who do you blame for wasting 20% of of your income on energy in all its forms?

Do you like blaming?  Want to stop?  ...
5880 2018-05-16 13:47:27 It can't be ignored.  I have felt nothing from the #GOPTaxScam! Gas prices are up, no more money in my pocket...but big business, oil corporations, Big Pharma, the insurance companies are all doing great! Thanks for nothing!

5882 2018-05-16 13:47:20 I accidentally changed the oil in my car with coffee, and then proceeded to drink 10W 40 with my breakfast. Early onset Alzheimer's is not for the faint of heart.

5886 2018-05-16 13:47:02 But Mr. Putin is particularly pleased with his puppet for Trump's screwing with Iran, causing oil prices to rise.

Trump's really delivered for Putin. 
1. No sanctions
2. Oil price rise.

5894 2018-05-16 13:46:06 You'd think Mr. Dealmaker could put a little pressure on his good pals in Saudi Arabia who are aiming for $80 a barrel. And US is now a net exporter of oil? Wow this is nuts...
5895 2018-05-16 13:45:35 HA. Let's count the # of liberals out in the oil field that brings energy to this country so liberals can charge their Toyotas.
5896 2018-05-16 13:45:25 Oh the irony.... it was information from Israel. Funny how things change when you need to bump up gas prices. High $$ due to a growing demand for petroleum fueled by strong economies around the globe and reductions in crude oil supplied from OPEC, Russia and Venezuela.
5897 2018-05-16 13:45:22 Oil companies should be charged with murder, genocide,and  ecoterror.
5898 2018-05-16 13:45:20 The differential between AB oil and WTI has blown out in the last two years, unlike anything we’ve seen before. I don’t think either of us are wrong but thanks for coming out

5901 2018-05-16 13:45:05 Snake-oil salesman is both figurative and literal. There are some good naturopaths out there as I have stated but the industry is not well regulated and there are many selling what has been 'snake oil' (Marketplace has good examples from their program for example) via loopholes
5902 2018-05-16 13:45:03 Nice quote today:  When you blame others, you declare that you cannot change until they change.  

Blaming dis-empowers you and it takes away all power of choice in you.  You have to wait for THEM to change before you can.  

Stop blaming!

Context:  Oil and transportation.

5914 2018-05-16 13:43:51 Well, it makes the price of oil go up, which makes Putin much richer and more powerful. So at this point it shouldn't surprise anyone that Trump wants it. What is horrifying is the assist from GOP, and from propoganda network "Fox News".
5915 2018-05-16 13:43:50 Look, Bruce Willis & his band of tough, yet loveable, oil men did not risk their lives in Michael Bay’s cinematic masterpiece just to have people like you mock their sacrifice with 0.0037%...*cries the words to “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing”

5919 2018-05-16 13:43:46 Crude oil prices have constantly rising, breaching $80/bbl now.
But inflation is still at double digit levels, unemployment is high and naira/$ exchange rates are still all over the place.
These problems have more to do with bad economic policies than crude oil prices- Onye Nkuzi
5920 2018-05-16 13:43:45 Nothing like waking up to a phone call from the mechanic that your oil change is going to now include $1300 in work

5930 2018-05-16 13:42:28 You never did answer my question you know. You said that cost-push isn't a thing because inflation, you claim, requires a growing money supply. I asked: what if rising prices, such as due to oil, caused more money to get created?
5931 2018-05-16 13:42:25 Trump when you support Chinese bankruptcy ZTE because they buy components produced in the United States, then the time is to produce cars that are not big and rude and cars we others who do not have an oil well in the backyard will buy
5932 2018-05-16 13:42:20 Not really everything - no mention of health risks or the dangers of the internet of things - just another way of collecting data (the new oil).
5933 2018-05-16 13:42:16 This patient of mine refused treatment that could cure, which is a legitimate choice, of course. But it was because CBD oil was sold as a miracle cure, not because my patient didn’t want curative treatment. That’s what’s sad.

5935 2018-05-16 13:42:01 Russia is an oil economy so the rise in oil prices makes Putin very happy. And pushing against making our economy more efficiant and less dependent on fossil fuels also makes Putin happy. See a pattern yet???

5965 2018-05-16 13:38:18 I hope ur right but I think money ruins everything. I don’t trust the govt and oil companies together to do the right thing. They prob will artificially deflate the price to put wind and solar companies outta business

5987 2018-05-16 13:35:58 Trump has a role in this.  Oil conglomerates were not as bullish to increase prices in an administration bent on clean power.  They held the prices low to keep the case -that that fancy green power was an expensive proposition and the average person will have affordable gas cars

5993 2018-05-16 13:35:29 Oh, and don't forget that Trump's NeoCon Foreign Policy 2.0 has doubled the price of oil meaning hundreds of dollars more spent at the gas pump by his supporters that all flows into the pockets of the Saudi, Qatari and Russian oligarchs.

5999 2018-05-16 13:34:44 bear in mind ive only read the first one. And the first one is clearly a metaphor for middle east oil where the White boy shows up and learns the ways of the natives.
6000 2018-05-16 13:34:32 My hope is Idaho citizens are tired of Repos reducing taxes then taking tax money and giving it to their friends rather than make the state better. Idaho Libertarian? What a joke, why the hatred for those that want to use CBD oil to help their kids.
6001 2018-05-16 13:34:24 If they all concur, I'll be the first to throw a few £quid in the hat to help 'oil the cogs'.
6002 2018-05-16 13:34:14 Where are the oil/gas refineries, steel mills, manufacturing plants in and around the 10 sq miles of DC that produce all of this carbon? Govt education has created the largest mass of asses the world has ever known.

6005 2018-05-16 13:34:02 The economy appears to be strong enough to withstand tightening conditions -- at least for now.  Tuesday's retail-sales data showed that Americans ramped up their spending at the start of spring, despite rising oil prices.
6006 2018-05-16 13:33:57 Oil splatters are so sare
6007 2018-05-16 13:33:54 I really hate ticks.. I mean who doesn’t? Call me crazy but everyday I put a cotton ball with 5-6 drops of peppermint oil in my pocket and those nasty critters stay away from me. Try it!
6008 2018-05-16 13:33:45 Why do you ask?
is it the UK`s oil now ive proved you wrong?
Are you going to say we are in UK so they are entitled to take 92%?
Do you accept I was not lying about that 92%
6009 2018-05-16 13:33:43 US Sen Grassley is fine with Scott Pruitt’s lies, corruption and waste of public funds but draws the line on granting biofuel waivers to oil refiners. Enough is enough - don’t pick on my corn related regulations.
6010 2018-05-16 13:33:33 Yesterday, I sold my 11-year-old Civic. From this day on, I will never have to stop again in a gas station or change oil. Waiting for delivery of my #Model3.

6028 2018-05-16 13:32:16 As if that’s not enough, short-term bond yields have been rising, oil and gasoline prices are hovering around multi-year highs, and stocks have been volatile. Major indexes, which had been on a winning streak of late, finished Tuesday 5.6% below their record highs.
6029 2018-05-16 13:31:58 For the record I don't support taxpayer "investment" in oil sands extraction. It is an unethical assault on the well being of our children and there are much wiser ways to create an economy focused on the clean energy generation the world actually needs. More leadership please.
6030 2018-05-16 13:31:54 O shit I also forgot my specialty, shred up some sweet potatoes w a cheese grater or food processor or some shit and bake it w oil and seasoning around 400 till it’s soft and then add bbq sauce and cook a little longer, put on toasted buns and u got a fake pulled pork

6033 2018-05-16 13:31:38 Good reason the US Government's paranoia about a plant needs to stop.  Lets actually do some “science” and see if it does affect cancer.  Not knowing just encourages the snake oil salesmen.

6036 2018-05-16 13:31:31 Petrol prices has too many external factors, such as oil prices etc, but yes effectively as people use it less the cheaper it will become to entice people to use it. There still is a lot to be done for electric vehicles outside of actually builsing them!

6041 2018-05-16 13:31:09 Even with the oil dive, had its leaders been educated and noble instead of corrupt and stupid, it'd have been fine. And even if it were a strongly capitalist country, losing 50% of its export value would've put it into a depression.
6042 2018-05-16 13:31:04 The people who will be impacted by this project and all the damage it will do to the environment don't support it and no one else's opinion matters. No one wants your dirty oil, keep it in the ground.

6053 2018-05-16 13:30:10 Factually, Venezuela had some pretty good Socialist policies. It did well for a while. It has two problems: Economy based on a single volatile export (oil) and corrupt leaders. Until oil dived 50% the country had a very low poverty rate and good quality of life with socialism.

The rise in oil prices of about 75 percent since last June "will take its toll," said the International Energy Agency in its monthly report, in which it reduced its forecasts of global oil demand growth by 40,000 barrels a day to 1.4 million barrels daily this year.

Sleep with hair in a satin bonnet overnight and untwist in the morning. Rub some oil in your twists before untwisting.

6153 2018-05-16 13:18:27 So Morneau says nothing this morning, in two languages.  Horgan's fault, vague talk of indemnity (devil is always in the details of indemnity), vague threat of other investors pursuing the project.  None of it addresses oil getting to market.

6155 2018-05-16 13:18:13 My oil paintings are shadowbanned. Does Twitter have a superpower, that gives it the ability to see into future conversations people will have about my art? Or does it see my art and say... "Yeah, no... that painting isn't healthy." Banning art. You OK with this America?

6163 2018-05-16 13:17:14 Incredible! The Liberal government is steadfast in their support for the #KinderMorgan pipeline and are willing to "indemnify" (provide compensation) to the Texas oil giant to ensure the project gets built. Further expansion of the tar sands is not climate action! #CdnPoli

6206 2018-05-16 13:13:12 Certainly makes sense. I’ve been of the view though w/respect to “cuts” & compliance that they really aren’t at all cuts but merely producing what they can reasonably without going “all out” which I understand can itself harm oil fields.

6241 2018-05-16 13:09:10 Maybe this will demonstrate the problem of oil wealth for you - since your "argument" is that UAE is successful purely because of good investments, if Gaza has a similar population and land mass, they should be able to do the same, all else equal.  Why aren't they as rich as UAE?

6257 2018-05-16 13:07:25 Yes some people at the BofE understand the monetary cause of inflation. In a discussion I found that Haldane still believes in oil push inflation and what MC understands I cannot decipher.
6258 2018-05-16 13:07:24 There is no similarity between dem socialists &  communists let alone nazis.  We currently live in an oligarchy, as Jimmy Carter said.  The banks, big oil, pharma & military industries direct every government action.  Flint still doesn't have clean water.

6260 2018-05-16 13:07:21 Before finding a final solution for this jehadi menace , India needs Energy security. As of now most of the Oil comes from the Islamic world. Rest of the sources too unreliable. Either we have to cut down on Oil import, Increase domestic production or find a Bakra somewhere.
6261 2018-05-16 13:07:11 It has to do with a change in benchmark oil prices
6262 2018-05-16 13:07:11 For starters show about not using soy oil, if you used canola it'd be you didn't know any better. Soy was proven a long time ago to be bad for humans. How about that liquid concoction you soak your banana peppers in? I think I'll make my own sandwich from now on.

6265 2018-05-16 13:06:44 And as every single product you buy, or the cost of getting to work, or kids getting to school on a bus, and on and on is affected by the cost of oil... enjoy the tax cut scam that will ummmm uhhhhh compensate.

6273 2018-05-16 13:05:52 3 comments on an, otherwise great article. Toxic brew should include decades of Western interference for access to cheap oil (ie 1953 coup in Iran); US sanctions have prolonged life of the regime by keeping the opposition poor and distracted; Trump couldn’t help it-he is racist!
6274 2018-05-16 13:05:08 NEVER they know our generation is trying to make the switch, so they’re catching the attention of those who aren’t fully educated. people!!! “fragrance” and “essential oil” should never be on the same ingredient list!

6285 2018-05-16 13:04:03 Thank you.  They have 2030 plan reduce dependence on oil income.  But as of now 97% what we use has something to do with oil, no escape.  (It is either carried by a container or motor vehicle or it is a by-product of oil like platic, paint, chemical, etc...).
6286 2018-05-16 13:03:42 Hmmmmm..... I wonder who would want to divide the US from its European allies?

Oh yeah, Vladimir Putin

The same guy who would want us to leave the Iran deal to drive up oil profits for Russia. 

And, the same guy who undermined the 2016 election to help Donald Trump

6295 2018-05-16 13:02:38 Yes. Specially now that Europe is going to ditch the U.S. dollar in payments for Iranian oil. The EU is planning to switch payments to the Euro for tis oil purchases from Iran, eliminating the middle man U.S. dollar transactions. We might even get cheaper petrol !

6300 2018-05-16 13:02:03 As opposed to Republicans who have lots of big ideas, like:

Giving all your money to rich people

Letting you die in the gutter if you get sick

Letting Iran get a nuke

Treating you like a third class citizens if you aren't a white Christian male

Ruining the Earth for oil $$$

6306 2018-05-16 13:01:20 That can only happen if the petrodollar retains its hegemony in the oil market (losing it by the day--Iran switched to Euros) and thus its status as reserve currency. Losing that by the day too. We can only print unlimited amounts of $ if we can force countries to buy our debt.
6307 2018-05-16 13:01:17 Best skin care:
1. Wag magpuyat.
2. Drink a lot of water.
3. Wash your face twice lang. Umaga gabi. May natural oil din kasi ang skin natin so dapat hindi masanay sa hilamos.
4. Olay products. Ask mo si ate seller kung ano bagay sa type of skin mo. Sa kin kasi effective yan.
6308 2018-05-16 13:01:16 There are many forces that affect the price of oil. Saudi Arabia has a grand plan to diversify from oil, but needs oil to be $100/barrel to afford it. The US now exports oil and gas so would also like to see the price rise. Your one example is just a small piece of the puzzle.

6392 2018-05-16 12:52:03 You’re exactly right! I cringe when I see our future work force pool.
6393 2018-05-16 12:52:02 It is great! More American jobs, and more money for Americans. When oil prices are high, America is working and thriving, if you’re from Houston, you should know this.
6394 2018-05-16 12:51:59 Coconut oil. Just plain old coconut oil. A jar lasts me about 6 months, and I can buy it in glass so there's no plastic cost.

Shame the oil price didn't bubble up last year then they could have been blame free for inflation Lol

Is the increases asked by Eversource 
One way to get funds to help pay for the building of Natural Gas lines into communities

6531 2018-05-16 12:37:28 Stillwater pumpkin porter. This mouth-destroying porter smells of crude oil.
6532 2018-05-16 12:37:22 Actually no it's just a myth, it doesn't make sense cos the oil will never mix with water, I prefer to just put a salt and then after you rinse your cooked noodles it the right time to put the oil :)
6533 2018-05-16 12:37:20 Similar response to research on gun violence (Dickey Amendment). Gun lobbies didn't like the findings of important research. And, in some cases, climate change. Big oil and developers do not like the findings so fund opposition research, try to kill funding. It is gross.
6534 2018-05-16 12:37:18 Alright...thank God, this'll be the last time in a while that I have to go out driving for something.  But it's for an oil change, so I'll be there for the next four hours or so.

6538 2018-05-16 12:36:37 follow the money...fairly basic, when the guy pumping gas into your car is the same guy changing the oil...who cares, just go with it.
6539 2018-05-16 12:36:29 Wasn't he also trying to import anti-tank launchers as well? His contacts for acquiring the arms were Islamic terror cells in the Philippines with access to some hefty weaponry.

6541 2018-05-16 12:36:23 Lol. Nah that’s just greed by the oil companies. The Iran crisis is what they are saying now. Nothing new there been happen for years because we are so dependent on foreign oil. Maybe if we could drill for our own oil it wouldn’t happen so much. Nice try but epic fail for you

6557 2018-05-16 12:34:38 Even in Afang, it won't be a swimming pool. Plus it's 2018 ffs. Who still drinks that much oil?
6558 2018-05-16 12:34:33 Does this depend on what kind of oil you use for cooking? Is there a good/bad oil list? Given prevalent food types, habits are hard to let go. Is it the same result if you cook with 'shuddh gheu'? People generally receive conflicting advice...
6559 2018-05-16 12:34:21 Yes! I swear adult onset motion sickness is a real thing. I'm now one of those women who *always* has peppermint oil in her bag.

6656 2018-05-16 12:20:00 Including cutting off Iranian oil shipments,  replacing them with increased oil production and replacement supplies to say, China, from Saudis?
IMHO, nothing happens in NOKO without "involvements" of China and Iran, possibly Russia. None of these "players" want @POTUS winning.
6657 2018-05-16 12:19:58 You & me shouldn't be commenting on issues beyond the scope of our understanding. It has high geopolitical repurcurssions u see. Iran will stop supplying oil if we dispatch a few pigs, so will saudi barbaria. UAE will shift all its investments out of India. See. Its too complex

6672 2018-05-16 12:16:50 OPEC sees oil's rally towards US$ 80 a barrel as a short-term spike driven by geopolitics rather than any supply shortage. Prices are high because of the tensions. It may exceed US$ 80 and then go down. In any case, the extent of the rally has yet to cause any real concern #lka

6678 2018-05-16 12:16:20 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.

6680 2018-05-16 12:15:48 Clean the grate as much as possible in advance, then put it on the grill until it gets red hot. Then take a few paper towels soaked in cooking oil and rub them on the grate with tongs. Works like a charm.

6719 2018-05-16 12:11:08 It depends on how you look at it. Oil though high priced brings with it massive environmental issues that are far reaching and long term. Renewables are more environmentally sound. Some have the potential to aid in solving other issues we currently face, unlike oil.

6773 2018-05-16 12:05:00 theres a lot of factors that can change it like when i was on accutane having no oil on my skin at all meant it was completely susceptible to sunburn. so im guessing less oil-> less protection? also sun protection is important always brigid pls wear sunscreen

6965 2018-05-16 11:38:55 Today should be an active session for the oil markets. EIA distillates stockpiles are forecasted for a draw of -2.155M. This is the largest forecasted draw on inventories since October of last year.

6977 2018-05-16 11:37:07 Whether it was used to syphon money or not.. The fact remains it was paid for according to the terms of a agreement..to get back the extra is Magu's job.

7036 2018-05-16 11:27:44 In The Holy Land is unforgivable. For the temptation of money / oil / power?
7037 2018-05-16 11:27:28 We must reduce our huge dependency on petroleum and develop solar power and other alternate energy; but nothing is being done because of the grip that the oil corporations have on our representatives (those we elected).

7039 2018-05-16 11:27:27 Err...Trump had little to do with the oil price.
Obama was the Fracker & Chief.

Trump just continued what Obama & Hillary started.
Fracking is disastrous.

Also that money from exporting oil, might look good as a percentage of GDP, but that wealth is going straight to the top 1%
7040 2018-05-16 11:27:19 He probably has you blocked. It's a video of some guy walking up to you and asking if you still sell snake oil over at 247. You're just like, "that's what we do."

7071 2018-05-16 11:22:16 EU and Iran to keep nuclear deal in place and to ditch US dollar in payments for Iranian oil. Expect an invasion soon, you know, to bring us 'freedom' and US style 'democracy'

The algae wouldn’t have much of an effect on the flavor of the beef.  We already have some feeds that use fish oil and doesn’t bother flavor.

7089 2018-05-16 11:19:36 The crazy part about these gas prices isn’t even the price itself. It’s the fact that the prices could be cut in half and these Oil corporations would still make a ridiculous amount of profit off of it. They’re just greedy AF and want more. People don’t question the businesses.

7187 2018-05-16 11:05:27 That's not how demand works. The price of oil would just rise and countries like the USA and other more reckless countries would pump chemicals into the ground and fracking becomes more profitable. The pollution would increase.

7189 2018-05-16 11:04:45 Trading oil is not 100% gambling, because people sometimes need to burn the oil.
Trading FX is not 100% gambling, because people sometimes need to pay taxes or pay a merchant in a local currency.

4. Limit oil availability to reduce food & thereby reduce population. #Crypto

7273 2018-05-16 10:52:39 2008, oil rose to what, $130 a barrel?  Look at what that caused.  

Watch this very carefully folks.
7274 2018-05-16 10:52:35 Surely that goes for pretty much all energy production? Oil is massively subsidised in the North sea. Why is pretty crazy to expect private companies to provide the infrastructure and production at but inflated prices, they wanted gurtanteed abovw inflation returns.

7277 2018-05-16 10:52:25 Hi - interesting thought but probably not. Peanut oil generally doesn't contain enough protein to trigger a reaction in those with allergies (unless it's cold pressed), so it likely won't even be recognized to promote tolerance.

Now oil prices have increased, yet the economy remains grounded.

7466 2018-05-16 10:18:55 There is no such thing as sustainable palm oil, not unless the area is returned to it's original state and we know that doesn't happen. #deforestation #palmoil #WestPapua
7467 2018-05-16 10:18:25 my name is Afolabi Elizabeth I and my friend @dostiy_grace make virgin coconut oil n sell footwear too

7469 2018-05-16 10:17:42 It's because of people like you if the situation is like this. We should forgive each other if we can. Those fans who honestly support us deserve to be honestly thanked.
Pour water on the fire, not oil
7470 2018-05-16 10:17:40 In the Alchemist you mentioned a prophet who told a story about two spoons with oil, I wonder what these two spoons of oil indicate?
And you wrote that to predict the future, that seer was actually guessing the future by the omens of the present, do you use that technic too?
7471 2018-05-16 10:17:31 If oil stabilizes for a couple of days short UST positions will unwind fast on profit taking (not all but enough for at least 10bp). This will immediately reverse the narrative on EM.

7473 2018-05-16 10:17:18 eZulwini sounds like some spaza that sells magwinya a go nka cooking oil ya dihlapi nna yena ke ya legodimong bazwalane
7474 2018-05-16 10:17:14 Sad but true....with oil below 50 USD he is without money to pay their core generals..... regime-change happens when everybody is expecting the contrary.
7475 2018-05-16 10:16:57 So the latest rumour on the rumour mill is that the EU is planning on buying its oil from Iran in Euros rather than Dollars in response to Trump pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal.

It'll be interesting to see if its true and where that ends up!
7476 2018-05-16 10:16:54 Источнику Спутника недоверяешь? Подождём, что западные СМИ напишут "The European Union is planning to switch from US dollars to euros when paying for the oil supplies from Iran, a diplomatic source told Sputnik"
7477 2018-05-16 10:16:53 It's OUR oil, bitch! You ain't gettin' it >:D

7482 2018-05-16 10:15:43 Faced with weakening Rupee, high CPI, climbing crude oil prices and uncertainty in Karnataka politics, the  market closed on a bearish note. (SENSEX down by 156.06 pts and NIFTY down by 60.75 pts) #HinduBusinessLine @businessline #BSE #nifty50

7484 2018-05-16 10:15:00 Agreed, I've had every bank in the country telling me to log in via their link and fix my account. Not to mention all the snake oil quack medicine peddlers.
7485 2018-05-16 10:14:59 $79/bbl .... Crude oil price
$45/bbl..... Nigeria budget benchmark

$79-$45 = $34... What Nigeria should save in ECA on every barrel of crude sold today

Assuming we are selling at maximum output of 2.2mbbl/day: $34 x 2.2m BBL/day... You do the math

How much is ECA/SWFA today?
7486 2018-05-16 10:14:49 @ChrisCuomo LibyaModel: endedwith the dictator getting killed on camera, not sure Kim will go for that.Correction: Obama didn't go and Bomb Libya, Europeans did b/c Libya is a major source of their oil Italy ring a bell? Obama/ was suffering fm battle fatigue.

They keep huggin it and getting rich.

7496 2018-05-16 10:12:53 learnt about people extracting oil from mbanje for export overseas. I’m just gonna go for the entire value chain in farming but we should watch fin tech gaps over time
7497 2018-05-16 10:12:13 To make the anti-wrinkle mask, use a tablespoon of honey and add some drops of lemon juice to it.
Add a few drops of almond oil (sweet) to this and mix the ingredients into a paste.
Then apply this on face, keep it on for 15-20 minutes and then wash off.

7507 2018-05-16 10:10:40 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
7508 2018-05-16 10:10:31 So then, what are the real values of those "100 year oil reserves"? With #RenewableEnergy like #solar on the technology curve, (think about phones 20 years ago) extracting, transporting, refining, and distributing can't possibly compete.

It's Buhari's poor economic policies not price of crude oil. @segalink @julietkego

7563 2018-05-16 09:59:09 In slavishly following Chavez's footsteps, Maduro has plunged his country into poverty and destitution.

7573 2018-05-16 09:57:26 The Syrian problem requires Putin to stop backing a murderous dictator and US to stop stealing meddling for oil money.  Israel, Trump, Putin are stirring the pot there to jack up oil prices. This benefits US oil co's and Russian fracked oil.

7575 2018-05-16 09:57:16 I asked you? Because I don't know what you called projects. Because most of those projects like the bridges in Eleme  junction was a Federal project done by Berger. Building few primary schools in an oil boom economy.

7597 2018-05-16 09:53:44 Oil sitting at $80 a barrel could climb back to $100 by end of year. People are not thinking  but we face a 2018/19 #WinterOfHighFuelPrices .
7598 2018-05-16 09:53:34 Everyone is now quiet like there's no oil boom in Nigeria. Crude is now at $80/barrel yet inflation is still high, unemployment rate still high
Naira still has no value in the fx market. 
It's Buhari's poor economic policies not price of crude oil. @segalink @julietkego

7602 2018-05-16 09:53:23 May the price of oil shoots up so that we have a breather before the new team irons out the economy. Peace
7603 2018-05-16 09:53:22 Oil has to be heated to the caramelization temperature. That’s the key. If it’s cooler, then the onion will slow cook and not get crispy brown. Also dropping onions will lower temp of oil so keep it slightly higher like 150 C. Fry in small batches as well

7606 2018-05-16 09:52:40 So i saw this tweet saying something like, “all you say is about clear skin, why won’t you take a shower?”

YOU FUCK! Showering too much is actually bad for the fuckin skin cuz it takes away the natural oil from your body! showering everyday won’t take away your acne.

7614 2018-05-16 09:51:24 Trade in oil is all done in dollars so countries have to buy dollars and it stimulates the dollar price. Countries that say they'll stop using the dollar usually get invaded.
7615 2018-05-16 09:51:22 I'm not certain of the whole situation. Yet applying an essential oil for any reason will take a few applications to address the issue.

7626 2018-05-16 09:48:18 I'm simply tired of this talk. If the Cavs win it's because of LBJ and how fantastic he is. It they lose it's the horrible coach, the role players, the weather, the local food, the oil prices or whatever. LBJ is to blame. Stop trying to find excuses for LBJ.
7627 2018-05-16 09:48:13 I will remember this as seeing the power oil has on the world. It’s been happening since Reagan was president.

7742 2018-05-16 09:27:57 No worries. Saudi is giving us oil for oil storage. As well within 6 months we will get Iran oil for just 30% payments.

7751 2018-05-16 09:25:57 What border? Israel doesnt even have any official border. All they do they grab more Palestinian lands! Most Gaza people are refugees. Israel allows a Canadian to "return" and seigs Gaza people from return! Imprisons them within fake borders in which they cant even use their oil.

7760 2018-05-16 09:24:53 Have to be dependent on oil again, but yeah oil is volatile. If cannot fill gap of the loss in revenue, have to fine ways to reduce opex? Or reduce leakages.

7763 2018-05-16 09:24:25 Oil and sanctions - it ain’t hard to figure out and they ain’t smart.
7764 2018-05-16 09:24:20 Would be ok for remainder of 2018 given increased oil prices. Would be a problem for 2019, or if oil prices drop
7765 2018-05-16 09:24:20 Ask US to bomb Iran and jack up the oil price.
7766 2018-05-16 09:24:19 Now here’s a thought, didn’t read somewhere that this Iran deal or no deal would take about 18 months to disengage so why are oil prices rocketing now,answer has got to be greedy bastard speculators and once again the many have to pay
7767 2018-05-16 09:24:17 How many people do you think actually voted for "short term losses"? How many who voted Brexit out of desperation have anything left to lose?

7780 2018-05-16 09:21:17 "Crippling sanctions"? What an Orwellian fake news by CNN. Russia's economy has fell only by 3.7% in 2015-16, and since has returned to growth, by now cancelling that decrease. And the fall was almost entirely due to the sharp oil prices decline, not due to sanctions = only 0.5%.
7781 2018-05-16 09:21:01 not sure whats the tax policy for the current replacement. so sekarang ni depa cakap kita takde tax langsung ke? kalau camtu theoretically harga barang menurun, but still harga barang yang subjected to fluctuation of oil prices masih naik turun. It's too early to tell la yen
7782 2018-05-16 09:20:56 Nikki Haley, the US ambassedor, walks out when the Palestinian envoy starts speaking about the Gaza massacre! 
The US only wants oil from the middle east. They aid dictatorships, they invented Taliban, and They help the Israeli occupation.
Disgusting.

7795 2018-05-16 09:19:09 Yeah, all those tax cuts for the big oil companies raised the prices to the highest in years. Thanks Kev.

7797 2018-05-16 09:18:44 it's usually acrylics where you get into the potentially synthetic polymer territory, though i can see the overall concern, if your line of thought equates oil paints to oil-based house paints that reek to high heaven.

7802 2018-05-16 09:17:56 Lots of arguments from both sides. Could 've said about demand, market tightness, Venezuela's falling production, geopolitical upside risk, few long term investments in oil projects & more.. I think oil will outperform for a few more months as the best 'late cycle' trade.

7818 2018-05-16 09:15:25 most oils in those paints are natural, and not really all that toxic, mostly linseed oil although other nut oils are used, but overall nothing synthetic that should cause any issue in that regard.
7819 2018-05-16 09:15:23 The funniest thing tho when they struck oil they weren’t arsed about how it was going to improve them, they actually thought that being billionaires would automatically make us shit haha Ev logic
7820 2018-05-16 09:15:15 The reason is US wanted to dominate the oil market. Shale oil has made US the largest producer. They want all other countries to buy their oil.
7821 2018-05-16 09:14:58 You tell me, Kas? How was it that Israel came to be in the first place and how was it that the non existent ‘borders’ of this ‘country’ grew? You can also tell me how Israel now controls part of Syria and is stealing its oil? You have a lot of explaining to do, Kas...

7868 2018-05-16 09:05:06 #Oil #Brent $BRENT fluctuates in the range $78-79/bl lacking drivers to go either side. On one hand we have Iran isolation and #MiddleEast instability, and one the other - increasing US #crude inventories and #EU hopes to fix #Iran problem. Current price seems like equilibrium.

7876 2018-05-16 09:03:48 こんばんにゃ。
7877 2018-05-16 09:03:40 It is the business practice of Fragrance Factory that makes them the most popular and favored destination for buying #Fragrance #Oil wholesale.
7878 2018-05-16 09:03:09 It is not economy that is improving, it is oil money that is booming.
7879 2018-05-16 09:03:02 Crude Oil Prices May Be Topping, IEA Report and Inventory Data Due
Crude oil price technical positioning hints a top may be taking shape. A monthly report from the IEA and official inventory flow data line up as potential catalyst...
7880 2018-05-16 09:02:52 What a dumb idea, so millions upon millions of hectares of biosphere to be ploughed under to provide plastic instead of oil out of a 5 inch pipe ... ffs
7881 2018-05-16 09:02:52 Never been but Art Deco buildings worth a photo. Also find a @TrueFoodKitch if you tire of pancakes . Sarah & I ate there in Atlanta. Can you buy CBD oil in FL? Say hi to Tory. X
7882 2018-05-16 09:02:48 There was a point in my life where I really loved ewa agoyin, now I can’t stand the oil
7883 2018-05-16 09:02:24 Did U know that after consuming any oil that in less than 25 min's it's hanging on your stomach, butt, or under your chin? True according to medical doctors!
7884 2018-05-16 09:02:23 at 5:00am DOW futures down 14, Oil down 30 cents, Gold up about 3 bucks
7885 2018-05-16 09:02:18 Much like they tried to supress the Husky Oil spill in Saskatchewan in 2016
7886 2018-05-16 09:02:16 We have earthquakes multiple times a day in Oklahoma, thanks to republicans and their love of oil.
7887 2018-05-16 09:02:11 When you drop food into a deep fryer and the oil starts bubbling, it's not boiling — moisture is more likely to cheat.
7888 2018-05-16 09:01:55 I’m not sure abt how you feel abt brands that test on animals but Neutrogenar is one of the many brands who do test on animals... you could use a lot of different alternatives or just any oil with highlighter
7889 2018-05-16 09:01:50 Capitalism is an obese political system and it conditions citizens to crave food in the same way that it craves resources (e.g. oil).
7890 2018-05-16 09:01:50 A cornbread waffle with shrimp in the batter.  Served with a maple syrup with a touch of chili oil.  Or just an omelette.
7891 2018-05-16 09:01:45 British and US coys ran Venezuela's oil for years, Chavez Nationalizes natural resources, chase em out, sanctions and sanctions and coup son
7892 2018-05-16 09:01:41 Oil and war, UoM has a lot to answer for
7893 2018-05-16 09:01:39 Hope they can help create peace. Also lower oil prices. Many poor are suffering.
7894 2018-05-16 09:01:31 Anas, IEA has close to no influence on Oil companies investment plans. Investors though do and the value destruction coming out of the last super cycle (03-14) has been so big that we are asking them to restrain themselves now. Invest only in low cost barrels.
7895 2018-05-16 09:01:30 The world doesn't know how sad I am. My pain that can't be mixed water and oil.

7961 2018-05-16 08:45:32 I think the impediment to this is the opacity of our Oil deals, as well as the NNPC.

No. Dow went up because energy stocks went up. Energy stocks went up cause oil prices went up a lot. People who need to fill their car with gas will soon suffer. Shame on trump.

They're living in real poverty now and the oil is still there.
8013 2018-05-16 08:36:07 You may well ask why Israel's conquests weren't recognised - probably western governments not wanting to jeopardize oil supply. It's behind most ME policy.

One difference: Israel didn't invade in 1967 - it was attacked. The invading armies were chased back almost to Cairo.

8039 2018-05-16 08:32:03 Although some view these actions as unnecessary in a free market, they are a rational strategy to shield China from energy disruptions, particularly U.S. attempts to coerce China by constricting its oil supply.

8059 2018-05-16 08:29:05 Ever wondered why extra virgin olive oil is used for sauteing? The oil has a good tolerance to heat and preserves most of the antioxidants and fatty acids of olives. The high smoke point makes it good for sauteing and not deep-frying.

8083 2018-05-16 08:23:09 I see. That's why Biriyani tastes great when we add brown onions to it. I think making brown onions as a prep and using those would save time and oil and make food taste great, which we can use instead of sautéing fresh onions.

8402 2018-05-16 07:28:04 "..Sri Vidya, it is a great, grand vision. No, not vision. Not imagination. But, the image of reality."

8414 2018-05-16 07:24:36 What is surprising, is that people are still sharing this debunked nonsense from 2016.  It assumes coal fired electricity generation, unrealistically bad EV efficiency, and massively undercooks the energy required to refine oil.
8415 2018-05-16 07:24:30 Plastic is perfect for keeping food fresh. The solution is not to ban plastic but to have effective recycling of it.

8467 2018-05-16 07:13:26 Part of the higher crude oil price is from Iran. They ran off all the educated ppl and though they can get oil out of the ground, they lack the know-how to refine it into gasoline--it's so bad they have to import most all their gasoline as they export almost all their oil.

8545 2018-05-16 07:00:28 Firstly you have to transport oil both to refineries and then huge deisel trucks have to carry it daily to forecourts. Electrical power goes direct almost instantly from where it is made and into car. Point 1!

8572 2018-05-16 06:57:12 Why would they bother. Oil is dying, a focus on climate change will only eat into the profits in a (now) limited lifespan business. They are going to squeeze every bit of possible profit out of oil for as long as they can. Climate responsibility comes at a cost!

8666 2018-05-16 06:35:02 I rise early. I work hard! Do I have to work on an oil rig now, or is this figuratively speaking? 
8667 2018-05-16 06:34:38 that's understatement definitely Chinese terrorists owned palm oil industry destroyed massive wildlife peatland and forests
8668 2018-05-16 06:34:37 The only time there will be peace in the middle east is when we don't need oil anymore
8669 2018-05-16 06:34:37 The global market predicts oil to reach $100 in 2019, Uganda should be fast tracking ''first oil'' in order to reap big during this surge. After 2019 the global economy is predicted to decline, now is the time to buy and invest before the crash.
8670 2018-05-16 06:34:36 I don't think so lol they're fucking pikeys who move onto the land of others and steal it. Look at most of the Hokan heights, isn't that Syrian by rights? And the lovely bit of oil and gas supply right next to it.  How lovely and convenient. :-)
8671 2018-05-16 06:33:55 Israel controls all imports and exports. They control their electricity, travel, water, shores, digging for oil in their waters. Just say you hate them and want them all to die. Enough with the whatabout bs.
8672 2018-05-16 06:33:50 Yes.

8674 2018-05-16 06:33:44 I proposed in 2001 permissioned domain (eg Dot Oil) platforms bounded by voluntary 'club' associative agreements both open & closed. Closed because only members can access: open because anyone agreeing rules/standards may join. Managed by market service provider
8675 2018-05-16 06:33:40 Goal of the @bcliberals, their supporters, and @Wilkinson4BC is: We're not happy until everyone else is unhappy.

Then we find out USA is Flush with Oil. Plenty of Oil. Oil everywhere. But we, You and I, are ‘told’ we can’t touch it?

8828 2018-05-16 06:00:26 Whether they gave it to us or not, we could have got it... the cause of the exchange of naira to dollar was from the price of crude oil. Back then it was expensive and now it’s almost one-third of the price

8839 2018-05-16 05:57:50 IMO, it's important to separate hard commodities and energy. I don't see hard commodities making a comeback, but I could see oil prices continue to rise. I'm long. USD strength will also surely be a factor.

Trump is openly promoting protectionism, increasing mil spending and funding and itching to start a war somewhere, or anywhere. And oil has always been the accelerant.

I mean I'm not too fond of the thought due to growing up in a household where it was used a lot.
But I appreciate the suggestion & will definitely consider it if this occurs more often. It might me stress related atm and should be better soon

8926 2018-05-16 05:39:09 I was going to cook with habaneros tonight but instead got habenero oil on my lips, eyes, and nose and I've never been closer to death
8927 2018-05-16 05:39:07 The United States having an oil shortage is ridiculous! We export more of our own oil then what we import for our personal use.
8928 2018-05-16 05:39:06 I assume she's getting the Grease Monkey $8 off full service oil chance with free vacuum and fluids check? By Trump standards she does have some miles on her by now!
8929 2018-05-16 05:38:52 The government has imported 60.4 million barrels (mbbl) of crude oil, while it locally extracted 21.8 mbbl, during the first eight months of the current fiscal year from July 2017 to February 2018, in order to meet the ever-growing energy needs of the country.

8933 2018-05-16 05:38:18 The United States ships more oil to other countries then we import for our own personal use. We have contracts with other countries. The countries we purchase oil from at a cheap price cannot sell oil to the countries that we do for a much higher price

8947 2018-05-16 05:34:59 Also, based on the notion that uneven heating in an edible could cause an overestimation of decarbed THC, it seems that using a fully decarbed oil in the recipe would be advantageous.

9079 2018-05-16 05:09:43 Lmao at the idea that Texas has "very little pollution," the tap water shouldn't be drunk anywhere from Waco to the coast, the beaches have been devastated by oil drilling, and Houston is a pollution nightmare
9080 2018-05-16 05:09:28 & there’s still some hint of light
A day laid dizzy
Cradled to the side
A warmth wrapped yellow
Consumed by the spry
tastes of hard pears, ash vault
The air stale as I breathe
Car parks, cut grass, oil & tires
My chest grows heavy
Sunken heart;
Where am I
Sprung upon the land

9082 2018-05-16 05:09:16 That's all well and good, but we lived under very false pretenses that we could clean up an oil spill while drilling in ice from artificial islands in the Beaufort Sea for decades. Nothing new under the sun.
9083 2018-05-16 05:09:13 I know that smelter well. I actually built the emissions control building for the new smelter a few years ago. I know that building like the back of my hand. Remember Tom, this isn't my first rodeo. Either build the refineries here, or leave that damn oil in the ground.
9084 2018-05-16 05:08:55 I guess. And jewish interests abroad (outside Israel) have been pumping money into Israel, to "support the cause" just like the muslim world, has been taking oil money and pumping it into terror attacks world wide. each side has their own tactic

9145 2018-05-16 04:57:54 hits all the tenants of snake oil: claim it was used in days gone by, it is "natural", it cures all, and someone is making a pretty penny from selling you your own tissue back - seriously, if it did all they claim, just eat it - why process it?

9215 2018-05-16 04:42:45 Seems like time well spent by @jonmccomb980 . Remember I have experience in building these things -- in Canada! Hearing you say it can't be done is preposterous.

Quite frankly if we can't refine in Canada, then our oil should stay buried in the ground. Exporting raw is obtuse.
9216 2018-05-16 04:42:43 Yeah read up on the properties of the specific type of oil you're using! Avo and almond oil are very low spf afaik
9217 2018-05-16 04:42:30 I welcome the confidence from investors, one has to wonder why @jjhorgan is okay with LNG but not oil.

Personally if I was the investor I would pull out, too much gaseous stink in this province right now.
9218 2018-05-16 04:42:13 Turkey left the border open to flood Europe with radicals in exchange for Syria oil
9219 2018-05-16 04:42:02 #MAGA @realDonaldTrump While you all toast the move of the US Embassy to Jerusalem, the Russian investigation is getting razor close to Trump. Oil prices are rising like ‘07-‘08  and will hurt the US economy. N. Korea has started playing Trump like a fiddle. DT wants China jobs!

9221 2018-05-16 04:41:51 Weird tip but a few drops of lavender oil cut the bitterness of coffee and alcohol and make them so damn smooth. 
9222 2018-05-16 04:41:49 I learned today that at least in New Mexico a patient no longer can get a better 10cc vial. Apparently it’s been determined that testosterone oil is not stable  in a vial for longer than 30 days. And that’s the new news
9223 2018-05-16 04:41:29 She getting the whole ya dig fuck bring the oil out 
9224 2018-05-16 04:41:27 Corn doesn’t really have any nutritional value and you aren’t supposed to give them corn oil bc it can cause an inflammatory reaction, so I would assume that feeding corn would have a similar reaction
9225 2018-05-16 04:41:22 The claws just show the depth of our love. They're like love dipsticks, and the blood is the oil of affection.

9231 2018-05-16 04:40:39 Just a bit. Usually olive, maybe canola if I can't find anything else. I learned it in Chile. But the Chileans I know also fried their eggs in about a half inch of oil... So take it for what it's worth!

9235 2018-05-16 04:40:07 I just realized I put by instead of buy  but baby oil works too ! You might just tan from it tho if you’re in the sun with it
9236 2018-05-16 04:40:03 So it looks line it’s all going to end up being about eliminating Sanctions and the Trump family making enormous amounts of money  from the Rosneft oil deal. Cohen, Kushner, Trump. All grifters.
9237 2018-05-16 04:40:00 anybody that tells you to put coconut oil on your face is a certified dumbass. same with lemon, alcohol, that fuckin apricot scrub.... shit is so fucking bad for your skin
9238 2018-05-16 04:40:00 But we don't love palm oil! They put it in every damn packaged food because is cheapest or easiest to process or gives them better numbers on nutrition stats for the price, but no one chooses it or would miss it!   And we would (will ..) miss the rainforest & the red apes.
9239 2018-05-16 04:39:38 The #BoulderCouncil passes a motion to adopt Ordinance 8253 extending the existing oil and gas moratorium until June 3, 2020.
9240 2018-05-16 04:39:19 We need to stop insulting snake oil....  I will have to write In Defense of Snake Oil on LinkedIn tomorrow....  stay tuned.

9262 2018-05-16 04:36:06 But with that said, I daresay history's most creative and inventive people were the folks who burned the midnight oil and crafted all of the technological innovations that have forwarded humanity. The artists, artisans, and architects of revolutionary ideas.

9303 2018-05-16 04:29:13 Look at CMF Clearinghouse. The best study of RTOR (5 stars, full empirical Bayes) shows significant increase in BMV & PMV crashes when RTOR allowed. RTOR was the result of the oil embargo in the 70's as were 55 MPH speed limits. We've dumped the latter. Time to dump RTOR!

9330 2018-05-16 04:25:20 Not all shale is equal. Must be marine oil source rock at or just past peak thermal maturity within certain limits of present burial. That filters out 90% of the world's shale. Then cost, lack of private mineral ownership, dealing w/ govts, political-fiscal risk, etc. & more.
9331 2018-05-16 04:25:10 Why does the industry need relief? As for "fleeing capital", it's because there are easier ways to make money in an oversupplied global market than investing in long-term, new mega-buck oil sands projects.

9353 2018-05-16 04:21:46 Omg that’s too much. I’m so sorry. I had them 2 years ago and my place is old too. They were coming in from under the dishwasher too! If you have peppermint essential oil, a few drops on cotton balls where you’ve seen them will insure they don’t chew their way back in.
9354 2018-05-16 04:21:46 I need to get my oil changed ASAP. Hope I have enough time on my lunch break tomorrow 
9355 2018-05-16 04:21:45 Maybe this beard oil will help with my patches.

9365 2018-05-16 04:20:07 "Does CBD oil help anxiety?"

CBD is the #cannabinol that is used to reduce the anxiety some get from THC. A higher CBD to THC ratio in medical marijuana is supposed to mitigate the “high” or “anxious” feeling.
9366 2018-05-16 04:20:03 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
9367 2018-05-16 04:19:57 Definitely getting a oil diffuser 
9368 2018-05-16 04:19:49 Superior in terms of free-range, torture-free, not factory-farmed? Superior in terms of high quality fresh oil? Superior in terms of not laden with salt? Vive the slow-food movement!!!

9372 2018-05-16 04:19:30 This should have been done prior to the Olympics while NK was in a deep freeze... In no time they would have no electricity, oil or gas and would have no means fight, and certainly no will... Japan and/or SK should have insisted this happen or done it themselves years ago...
9373 2018-05-16 04:19:19 Yey do you have any questions? You can either use coconut oil or castor oil for the brows and lashes. Both get the job done

9378 2018-05-16 04:18:52 Oil brings Saudi king to Moscow
9379 2018-05-16 04:18:49 Amen to that. I’ve dug in to a little bit of Native history and was surprised at how many tribes there are. Just sorry that their #s are dwindling. “Big oil” running lines through their territory
9380 2018-05-16 04:18:44 So you and your government are "their partners in crime" !!!
Is all of these for money? Oil?...but ... the world would be a better place without the Mollas regime in Iran , Afghanistan or any other place!

9420 2018-05-16 04:12:37 Most likely because essential oil diffusers are so new and it’s still pretty much trial and error and unfortunately pets getting sick to know what ones are toxic to them :( I just stick to my incense sticks and me and my pets are good.

9438 2018-05-16 04:07:58 Sorry @JustinTrudeau, but pipelines like #KinderMorgan will only create jobs in one province and benefit big oil. It is not in Canada's interest to build this and it won't befit Canada's economy. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtectInlet #NoPipelines #KeepItInTheGround

9441 2018-05-16 04:07:23 One reason the global economy cant handle +$80/bbl oil is that global GDP growth is at 4% now despite the talk on syncrhronous growth, while the same metric was 5.5% in 2010, and trending above 5% in the run-up to the 2008 price rally.

9471 2018-05-16 04:01:59 Trudope and the liberals have always hated the power that the west has obtained ever since the first well started gushing oil.

9481 2018-05-16 04:00:55 Some EOR is done with CO2 extracted from underground for that specific purpose. Otherwise it’s often done with steam, or the extra oil is left in place and other oil pumped instead.

9494 2018-05-16 03:58:46 Lib/Socs killed Energy East & Northern Gateway, you know that & refuse to acknowledge it to promote fallacies. Both Trudeau & Notley actively worked to stop Canadian oil from reaching tide water.
9495 2018-05-16 03:58:40 Crude oil prices has been on the increase since the present administration of PMB. However unemployment, inflation, bank lending rate and other positive economic indicise remained on the high side.

9497 2018-05-16 03:58:33 to even say that the increase in inflation is solely brought about by the train law is stupid. try to also check global prices of oil tnx

9499 2018-05-16 03:58:27 According to these charts, the upturn in oil prices and therefore, one supposes, middle eastern tension began in July, 2015.
9500 2018-05-16 03:58:03 All I care about is if you are completely in oil.
9501 2018-05-16 03:57:46 You can by that oil at Walmart but you gotta add highlighter powder to it lol
9502 2018-05-16 03:57:43 Man I got you. It’s gotta be as easy as aN oil change 
9503 2018-05-16 03:57:35 You are a lying and hypocritical group. Taking money from 'so called other charities' whose only purpose is to cripple the Canadian oil industry so they can make more money on their own oil. You can go get stuffed!
9504 2018-05-16 03:57:32 Trying to convince my mom to try CBD oil, but she seems very suspicious. How can I convince her?
9505 2018-05-16 03:57:08 You produce oil. Not so for the lower 48 non-producers.

9512 2018-05-16 03:56:14 Our government must fight them! China is very keen for a trade deal with Canada. And they want to buy up our corporates. In fact, they wanted to buy an oil sands company- but wanted guarantees that only Chinese nationals were allowed to work in their Alberta purchase.

9517 2018-05-16 03:54:29 Jublia is less a snake oil (it is a true antifungal agent), but it is completely ridiculously priced and as such should never be prescribed.
9518 2018-05-16 03:54:28 Well solar doesnt have as many friends in Congress as Oil,Gas & coal so that’s a thing if they did it be a different story
9519 2018-05-16 03:54:28 Humanity needs to stop raping and pillaging its Mother. Crude needs to be at least $80/barrel. Without the lust for foreign oil the US would behave itself and mind its own business. Cost is the great pacifier.

9531 2018-05-16 03:52:56 99.99% of 3.7 million is 3.6 million or so. You’re a moron. I’ve lived my whole life in Alberta. There’s lots of farmers, lots of oil field workers and lots of people who live a damn good life. Many oil companies don’t value work life balance. But you don’t have to work oil

9535 2018-05-16 03:52:23 I'm not being deliberately contrarian but won't the world live w $100 oil? Last time it was there US10 yields were also at or above 3pct for eg and demand growth was healthy...

9543 2018-05-16 03:51:46 More to come,but get on board and help those who need it. And criminal usury must be enforced.  Criminal usury is just the tip of the iceberg, Crude oil prices are not driven by supply and demand but a corrupt 5% margin Futures Market.

9551 2018-05-16 03:50:26 No, it's oil mixed with sand. The cost of extraction is due to the high amount of sand that needs to be separated. Water is used for separation not sand. This goop has been around forever. Natives used it to waterproof their boats
9552 2018-05-16 03:50:23 North Korea without their nukes, would be like Saudi Arabia without its oil. Nothing!! They are NOT going to give them up, no matter what bellicose threats come out of the ConMan's mouth.
9553 2018-05-16 03:50:19 And the GOP too, ahead of the mid-term elections in November. Oil at $100 would increase the risk for the GOP to lose both the House and the Senate.

9578 2018-05-16 03:46:57 that is a great question, one i don't know the answer to. the legislature gave control of the oil industry very early on to the progressive era Railroad Commission, and the state very vigorously encouraged native control of extraction, but i dunno how it was taxed

9695 2018-05-16 03:33:17 Think about it this way, it be cheaper and easier to get rid of the problem, aka Trudeau, then to not build pipelines. If we don't want pipelines and be oil dependant - that is fine, but have an alternative plan in place, have a plan that isn't useless and called a carbon tax.

9737 2018-05-16 03:27:01 I’m a bit confused by this because I interpret “snake oil” as something that has no effects being promoted as effective. As in, benzos have no actual effect on the person, not as in they don’t treat anxiety long term. Do benzos not have a biological mechanism or response?

9746 2018-05-16 03:25:39 My point both have dreams of empire building by taking away the land and minerals of others. They are trying to control all the oil in the middle east and North Africa. Getting ready to attack Iran just like they did Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan and other oil rich countries.

9753 2018-05-16 03:23:54 Trump backs out of the Iran deal, causing Iran to resume their nuclear program. Now Trump will use this as a reason to go to war with Iran, inflating oil prices further, and leading to an increased value in Rosneft, Russian’s state-run oil giant, owned partially by Qatar.
9754 2018-05-16 03:23:28 I was thinking that! I’m gonna try that next time, I thought the olive oil and honey would’ve did the trick lol

9768 2018-05-16 03:21:25 Not trying to self diagnose myself but I have a similar issue! I saw this tweet earlier and went out out bought coconut oil. Let’s hope it helps me too 
9769 2018-05-16 03:21:10 it makes me wonder why the HELL THEY haven't figured out how to pull all the disgusting toxic oil out of the ground and literally destroy it all so it can't cause anymore damage#ClimateAction #tarsands #cdnpoli #abpoli
9770 2018-05-16 03:21:07 Anyway just went & bought a carrier oil & some essential oils , im gonna make my own shimmer body oils

9779 2018-05-16 03:19:07 Just got home from work and catching up with #SDLive ... it is bad enough we have to listen to @BigCassWWE on the mic... (bring back @real1 please) but Cass can you at least stop using the whole bottle of baby oil? You look like a fool. It's nasty bro.
9780 2018-05-16 03:19:05 NO idea if you have any access to it or are up to try it. But CBD oil is a decent muscle relaxant! I use it when my body is giving me aches that arent in my joints and whatnot (lower back, shoulders/neck esp.) Again not sure how you feel about it but thought it worth a mention!
9781 2018-05-16 03:18:49 Put calmness oil in my diffuser and took Benadryl I'm about to be KNOCKED

9784 2018-05-16 03:18:27 Whose the bigger thief: oil companies or insurance carriers.
9785 2018-05-16 03:18:26 As for KM... we All benefit and have been doing so for decades. Canada is a resource country with a small pop. No one seems to have an issue selling all out other resources, besides oil...

9787 2018-05-16 03:18:03 I decided to swap out my almond oil for jojoba oil as a moisturizer for my face...and I’m going right back to Almond oil. 

My face is not feeling the jojoba at all.
9788 2018-05-16 03:17:50 Today, you'll see @Samir_Madani tweeting here on #OOTT. This is just a reminder that before you take whatever he pushes seriously, you probably should ask yourself "is he paid by someone?". There are many paid narrative pushers here so.... #WTI #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F
9789 2018-05-16 03:17:47 despite my night going to shit, i’m here to recommend coconut oil shampoo and conditioner. mine is virgin oil but any oil works.
9790 2018-05-16 03:17:23 this guy for real? US being the worlds largest consumer of Oil and Gas, we did not need to diversify. NDP had taken us back more than 10years in R&D from the oil industry. This is where alternatives are found!!
9791 2018-05-16 03:17:14 ya more like Shit oil
9792 2018-05-16 03:16:51 gw suka ada redness yang gatel gitu di muka jadi gw pakein bio oil terus jadi mendingan, gitu aja sih. combination + sensitive.

9798 2018-05-16 03:16:23 “CBD oil will cure your cancer”. It is unfortunate to see folks be misled by well meaning friends/ family members, who suggest asparagus diets, apple cider vinegar and intravenous vitamin C as viable alternatives to chemotherapy.
9799 2018-05-16 03:16:22 tea tree oil is a miracle worker
9800 2018-05-16 03:16:14 For liquid shimmer, you just need baby oil and some type of loose powder highlight. Shake the bottle up and BAM....you got the fenty glow
9801 2018-05-16 03:16:09 A friend of mine who flew for the CIA before the airline gig swears this is about Iran getting its gas and oil to Western Europe, through Syria, thwarting Saudi Arabia and the West.
9802 2018-05-16 03:15:59 @PepenadorAVC speaking of murderous cops, I just had a memory from when I was a kid. In Humble, TX. At the Good Oil Days (get it? Good ol' Days) - Humble is the home of Exxon. The Humble PD had a booth setup and were selling a bunch of pigs in cop uniform things.
9803 2018-05-16 03:15:46 mix together equal parts baking soda and coconut oil, great natural exfoliant
9804 2018-05-16 03:15:42 When someone has something u want, u label them an enemy, so ur justified in attacking them!(& stealing their oil).Remember that Iran is NOT Iraq!Iran is the size of Alaska(very big)! Iraq is half the size of Texas&we've been stuck there for 17 YEARS!We cant beat Iran's military!

9808 2018-05-16 03:14:55 So tiered of all the bullshit! Can not get over how people think they are going to live without oil products. The list is endless and yes, we do need an alternative. Shutting this down is not an answer, it is an unrealistic dream. Right now we can  NOT do without OIL.

9810 2018-05-16 03:14:43 It’s basically just the recipe for Palestinian chicken from @BingingWBabish but I also roasted it over some quartered potatoes tossed with olive oil, fresh rosemary, and sumac. It was bonkers good!
9811 2018-05-16 03:14:42 R5-D4, the story about his missed opportunity in life on that droid transport. It details his life of bad oil addiction and selling out through his cleanup stage and landing a good droid role.
9812 2018-05-16 03:14:37 having a car is cool until you have to get an oil change..or an inspection..or a registration stick or new brakes...or new tires...or pay for gas.

9815 2018-05-16 03:14:13 but do I want to kill my roommates with burning oil fumes
9816 2018-05-16 03:13:59 Why hasn't the shale oil taken off outside the US? Are the geographic and economic conditions unique or it is just a matter of time before other Permians and Bakkens sprout up in other continents? #OOTT

9829 2018-05-16 03:11:49 First off, I believe Climate Change is a thing, (if you want to schedule a twitter fight about it I'm game), Secondly, oil isn't going anywhere anytime soon, if ever, and more taxes is definitely not the way to go about solving the problem. We need solutions, not Cash Grabs
9830 2018-05-16 03:11:42 You need to check your facts! Oil is coming to a 4 year high; Trump’s lawyer Cohen orchestrated a deal with the Qataris to invest in the  Russian energy giant, Rosneft; If oil spikes they all win! Coincidence or pure graft?
9831 2018-05-16 03:11:36 im not finished. have to get a new set of tires & still get my oil changed. get my light bulbs changed & some new cable cords that connect to the battery. lol

9853 2018-05-16 03:08:46 Oil prices hit a 3-1/2-year high yesterday supported by tight supply & sanctions on Iran are likely to restrict crude oil exports.

9887 2018-05-16 03:03:10 baby oil increases the risk of sunburn!!! try an almond oil! that works really well and is more natural! i’ve heard olive oil is good too but i’ve never tried that so i can’t speak from experience
9888 2018-05-16 03:03:04 Nope. I have a 2003 Benz and I find that at least $1000 in maintenance is needed about every 6 months. Oil changes are over $100. Filling up the tank? Almost $50. Just got new tires...almost $600. I’d take the Honda any day. Having a luxury car is expensive especially if it’s old
9889 2018-05-16 03:03:00 Cavs scored 23 points in the last 16:50. Seized up like a car trying to go 80,000 miles without an oil change. They're a mess.
9890 2018-05-16 03:02:50 Alchemy Skill Hunter instinct is still not working on consoles it supposed to give 100% critical hit damage on the targeted enemy this must mean that you must apply the right oil type and it will always hit 100% twice your max damage  from what i understand please fix this
9891 2018-05-16 03:02:37 i definitely cover myself in shimmering lotion or highlighter and oil all the time tho

9895 2018-05-16 03:01:55 This is just the easiest method at this time and requires basically no technology... Remember when Tar Sands were uneconomical because the oil was too hard to extract? Funny how ingenuity and desire to make something can initiate innovation. Use your imagination buddy.
9896 2018-05-16 03:01:54 You are out of oil.
9897 2018-05-16 03:01:53 Just goes to show who's pulling the strings on these puppets in journalism....Big oil of course.

9902 2018-05-16 03:01:10 At least capitalists pay a fair price for oil. Venezuela is giving Cuba oil for next to nothing.
9903 2018-05-16 03:01:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, however lower wages.
9904 2018-05-16 03:01:07 But here is the bigger question.  Does it matter what the "matter and form" is of a Sacrament?  Instead of water may we use coke for Baptism?  Instead of a man and woman may we use two women for marriage?  Bible says oil for annointing - may we use dirt? @StefMNicholas
9905 2018-05-16 03:00:47 Interesting choice - is there an appropriate time to give this snake oil? What do you prefer?

9910 2018-05-16 03:00:19 I used to think aromatherapy would never seriously cure my problems, until one day I tried using lavender oil for my insomnia and couldn’t keep my eyes open after 2 mins!!!
9911 2018-05-16 03:00:09 I accidentally bought "natural" peanut butter and I'm using my rage towards JR Smith and Jeff Green to power me through mixing the oil back in
9912 2018-05-16 02:59:46 i went 2 whole days thinking my pimple wasn’t going away but it was just a burn from that horrific oil
9913 2018-05-16 02:59:37 I love the smell of tea tree oil
9914 2018-05-16 02:58:43 Coconut oil girl!!! 
9915 2018-05-16 02:57:59 It's Rattlesnske oil.
Obvioudly.
9916 2018-05-16 02:57:56 Ants can survive harmful chemicals but really hate peppermint oil so just put some of that on the baseboards
9917 2018-05-16 02:57:31 これ読んで思ったけど、自称コミュ症の人は大抵コミュ症じゃなくてただの人見知りが多い気がする、そもそも相手にきちんと自分の事紹介できる時点でコミュ症じゃないからー！って思う
9918 2018-05-16 02:57:28 No. I’m simply saying that what we believe could have a significant impact on whether our faith stands or falls when it’s tested. The wise and foolish virgins all waited for the Bridegroom and had oil in their lamps, but the foolish weren’t prepared for a long night.
9919 2018-05-16 02:57:26 Coconut oil is Jesus Christ itself but it also can be Satan when that shit catches on fire when you’re cooking with it
9920 2018-05-16 02:57:11 Today I bought a funnel to keep in my trunk for the probably one time in the next fifteen years I need to pour oil into my car engine and I am not at a garage.  This is the farthest ahead in my life I’ve planned in years.
9921 2018-05-16 02:56:50 The world will end the day that my nightly ritual of brushing castor oil onto my eye brows with an old British Airways complimentary toothbrush finally pays off. Glorious apocalypse brows.
9922 2018-05-16 02:56:48 @Hyperphil25 Téa tree oil, and I’m bout to try this natural hair lotion my Patna gone put me on
9923 2018-05-16 02:56:43 You get 5 culture and 1 tourism on tiles with unimproved sea resources (not oil) and on things like Ivory and furs?
9924 2018-05-16 02:56:36 I didn't know if you knew but Russia is on the verge of collapse! Why? What is there main source of money? Gas? Nope! Oil! That is why Energy Independence & US drilling is important. Bankrupts Russia!
9925 2018-05-16 02:56:33 Donald ain’t exactly an oil painting.
9926 2018-05-16 02:56:25 You may have an argument for saying these individuals are hypocrites when they accept a pension funded in part by resource development. Or perhaps you’re referring to just #KM, which is just about selling oil to Asia at BC’s risk which isn’t total resource development.
9927 2018-05-16 02:55:59 I’m a nurse, not doctor but coconut oil for EVERYTHING makes me insane. That and CBD for curative purposes. Stop.
9928 2018-05-16 02:55:55 Every single person on this app who hears “Laurel” needs to come by my house so I can pray over you with anointing oil. Because I don’t know what unclean spirits are speaking to y’all

9931 2018-05-16 02:55:27 a lot I've seen have olive oil, eucalyptus and walnuts :-(
9932 2018-05-16 02:55:25 Why can’t we eliminate religion?

Because then men won’t have a scapegoat to why they’re fighting. The real reason behind wars is never religion. Always land, money, oil, other resources

9934 2018-05-16 02:55:22 There is the infrastructure argument. Remember, the oil sands are owned by the people of Alberta and their needs must take precident, always.
9935 2018-05-16 02:55:10 อยากได้ sun acne oil control ค่ะ
9936 2018-05-16 02:54:58 Boil water first you could put a little oil in water then you noodles won't stick together!!
9937 2018-05-16 02:54:49 Didn’t watch but you know we’re going to have good Americans die in an Iran war so the one percent can squeeze mo money from the earth’ s oil recourses? 
9938 2018-05-16 02:54:43 JR so wack ....you ain’t even gonna get beard oil for that chivita homie shit one hot ass day away from combusting

9942 2018-05-16 02:54:12 Hey Larry, Curly and Moe.....Harper got rid of Wheat Board....were you asleep when this happened...more profitable to ship oil than wheat....do the math Moe.
9943 2018-05-16 02:53:29 Nah. I leave that to the high school kids.
9944 2018-05-16 02:53:20 Gotta go get this oil change before the weekend for sure ...
9945 2018-05-16 02:53:18 Scrubs will irritate the skin, especially when it flares up. I'd suggest neem oil without knowing the area and current care routine.
9946 2018-05-16 02:52:54 Yea the only thing I mixed with it was coconut oil I definitely recommended coconut oil it’s the best
9947 2018-05-16 02:52:39 Brian also once argued that the govt needed to intervene to slow down oil sands production. So it’s fair to say he’s been all over the map on these issues.
9948 2018-05-16 02:52:26 edgy?
9949 2018-05-16 02:51:43 Is that Jesus dunking?!! Oil on black velvet?!!


9950 2018-05-16 02:51:40 It seems Big Oil is opposed to the public knowing the facts.  #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #FossilFuels #economy
9951 2018-05-16 02:51:39 Sort of want oil to go down in a hope it’s reflected in pump prices. Not very likely with USA summer around the corner.
9952 2018-05-16 02:51:19 Jr a oil smart

9956 2018-05-16 02:50:00 Wait if CBD oil is non-psychoactive, how does it help with anxiety???
9957 2018-05-16 02:49:50 Hi guys, lets stop this, u don't tell an adult that it is raining when there is no water falling from the sky, let the price of Dollar, cost of Milo, Sachet milt, School fees, price of Garry, Rice, Oil even Sachet water be the JUDGE.
FULL-STOP.
9958 2018-05-16 02:49:44 It’s part of the matrix they’ve set up. They make the rules and have to work around them to maintain the illusion. Just like with sanctions against nations. It’s a game...Iran still sells its oil, for instance...it’s just done in a creative way.
9959 2018-05-16 02:49:36 And he doubles down on it ugh... He attacks Oliver for not being as disgusted in response to Chavez seizing control of oil, but looking on the video it seems to be playing into the comedic slant on his show, to me it looks like Crowder is setting up a black and white fallacy...

They need the jobs...
9968 2018-05-16 02:48:15 Says some who never had to handle an oil truck or propane tanker ...
9969 2018-05-16 02:48:03 ANY type of natural oil that will cure EVERYTHING!
9970 2018-05-16 02:48:02 so before i left home last week i had my oil changed&new windshield wipers put on. since leaving illinois i’ve had to stop at 3 different auto centers. 1 in nebraska for a tire change, 1 in arizona for the other three tires, and 1 in wyoming bc the storm snapped my wiper blade 
9971 2018-05-16 02:47:59 Kalau kau pakai, stop. Jgn pakai lgsg. Nak g mana2 pun jgn pakai. Dia mmg sedih, tak confident but skin perlu sgt2 bnda tu. Pastu buat double method cleansing. First guna cleansing oil, pastu baru cleanser yg foam or apa2 yg kau guna skrg.
9972 2018-05-16 02:47:49 I love homepressed olive oil. Had the best in Portugal. The village I was staying in lost all their trees in the terrible fires in Sept 2017
9973 2018-05-16 02:47:38 كل عام وانتم بخير
9974 2018-05-16 02:47:31 No oil. No Blood.
9975 2018-05-16 02:47:11 Won't have 'living'? Puh-leeze. Show me one thing, one single thing here in NZ that's 1) climate related and 2) a threat to anyone's standard of living, let alone their lives. Bet you can't. This ban on oil exploration is expensive virtue signalling that will achieve nothing.
9976 2018-05-16 02:47:10 Baby oil + your favorite highlight = body lava.

Prosper bitches
9977 2018-05-16 02:46:53 I say we take the guys that stand outside the oil change place with signs that say no waiting and put them at the empty registers at Walmart.

9978 2018-05-16 02:46:42 #TipTuesday More than one alcoholic beverage a day can cause increased oil production and enlarged pores. Lack of sleep can result in the same issues! So, put down the bottle and get some sleep for better skin.
9979 2018-05-16 02:46:40 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Not even close. It’s all a scam by the Greatest Snake Oil Salesman of the century! 
9980 2018-05-16 02:46:38 is it a specific oil you gotta use?
9981 2018-05-16 02:46:37 Orange, lemongrass and peppermint oil in the diffuser. It's all about the ENERGY to get stuff done.  Let's do this!
9982 2018-05-16 02:46:23 Richard,Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. How can the green left rationalize obstructing  Gay friendly Oil while enriching Gay killing bloodoil? @vancouverpride
9983 2018-05-16 02:46:23 Ramadan hack to beat chapped lips season: Put a couple of drops natural facial oil on your mouth before you go to bed (or a couple of hours before suhoor). If you don’t have any, coconut oil should suffice!
9984 2018-05-16 02:46:10 At least I can say I'm not guilty of using palm oil, or at least not that I know of...
9985 2018-05-16 02:46:09 It’s chafing season my dudes! 

So here’s a pro tip from one thick-thighed lady to another: baby oil protects you like no other AND keeps your skin super soft. Have a wonderful pain-free sunny season friends!
9986 2018-05-16 02:46:05 Or the other one.. “Thanks for calling Valvoline INSTANT OIL CHANGE how can I help you?” .. “Do you guys do oil changes?” 
9987 2018-05-16 02:45:47 Blend 8 oz cherry with 3 cups bluefish. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve a la mode
9988 2018-05-16 02:45:43 More than I’m willing to pay to subsidize oil companies? Actually it’s moot, I live + work in Canada where I’m happy to pay taxes for childcare subsidies, single payer health care, and other things that make libertarians cringe.
9989 2018-05-16 02:45:36 First Nations have the right to say “yes” and many have. Telling signs that Serge Simon is paid by US special interest groups:
1) “Tar Sands”
2) “Dirty Oil”

9992 2018-05-16 02:45:18 So grain-of-salt-I'm-not-a-professional here, but-- weight loss. Potatoes are /really/ satiating, and compared to how satiating they are, don't have that many calories in them (provided they don't have any butter/oil etc on them).
9993 2018-05-16 02:45:13 i wish i put on some tanning oil before school today

9995 2018-05-16 02:44:49  Everyone at Bayside thought they were going to strike it rich with that oil.
9996 2018-05-16 02:44:18 yes gold far more stable than paper backed by a barrel of oil!
9997 2018-05-16 02:44:16 .@realDonaldTrump Ever hear of Al-Ruhmaihi? How about meeting in trump tower Dec 12th 2016? Bribery seems to be the theme. Cohen asked to have millions of dollars sent to drumpf family. Russian sanctions...oil deal? I hope U R going down, quickly.
9998 2018-05-16 02:44:15 So I got this new almond vanilla body oil and now I’m going to bed smelling like dessert.
9999 2018-05-16 02:44:10 Plane tickets? With these oil prices? NO THANK YOU.
10000 2018-05-16 02:44:08 I mean.... kid number 3? Maybe a little... King Oil massage?
10001 2018-05-16 02:44:06 None. Not with all those 'immigrants' taking over@
10002 2018-05-16 02:44:05 I'll let you know in a couple hours, see if it lasts. It's really runny I wish it was more of a lotion consistency than an oil but I don't think a lotion would mix with the highlighter as well
10003 2018-05-16 02:44:03 Me and him 5 strayed away still wearing same hat lol and neither of us have worked the oil fields 
10004 2018-05-16 02:44:01 Lush Dark Angels Cleanser, Witch Hazel Toner that has no alcohol, 100% tea tree oil for a spot treatment, & Coconut oil as a moisturizer. Use sheet masks once a week!

10006 2018-05-16 02:43:55 Roblox name : nailsone. Can i suggest something to add to LTBE?

( Ramp bleuprints but with oil and other thing like that to make road because black wood is to dark to make an road, and grey don't have look great for road ). Is ending thans to see this ;)
10007 2018-05-16 02:43:55 I was going to diffuse some tonight ! I can mix that with coconut oil and slather it on me right ? haha I'm literally going to do everything I can tonight to stop it from progressing !! I have this dull ache in my lungs I know exactly what will happen
10008 2018-05-16 02:43:54 Oil diffusers.  People are putting these all over their homes to cure everything.  Lavender and melaleuca oils are causing precious puberty in kids.
10009 2018-05-16 02:43:54 I'm beginning to think all of trump's postering with all these different nations is just to help the Mafia become more powerful and rich. It sure as hell isn't about our best interest. Isn't Russia getting more per barrel of oil than before all this hullaballoo?

10015 2018-05-16 02:43:30 Today sucked in every sense but I have lavender in my oil diffuser and tomorrow’s a new day.
10016 2018-05-16 02:43:28 I just paid more for gas than I have in a few years.  You would think that with Trump’s Billion dollar tax breaks for oil companies, they could cut us a break on gas.
