28 2018-02-06 22:36:15 When you raise the price of corn for the production of Ethanol it has a domino effect on other commodities not only on the stock market but also in food production. Damn, but you're ignorant.

31 2018-02-06 22:32:18 @philipsphile Heard your reasoning about the stock market "dip" on Friday and Monday.  The "correction" may be better explained by: "An ETF holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and is designed to keep it trading close to its net asset value".  The ETF's had to sell

34 2018-02-06 22:26:29 I'd love to retaliate against Alberta with a boycott of our own, but since that province produces little beyond generic commodities, it's a lot harder for us than it is for them.
35 2018-02-06 22:21:13 No shit my beef is with capitalism. Capitalism enables people like Musk to take what should be big wins for humanity and turned them into commodities for individual self-enrichment.

50 2018-02-06 21:07:55 Exactamente. As cryptos (com excepção de alguns casos) não prometem ganhos garantidos a ninguém. São apenas commodities digitais onde alguém está disposto a pagar mais que o último investidor por elas.
51 2018-02-06 21:06:39 1/ I don’t think that there will be less coercion; or more effort to support motherhood; I think children will simply be seen as commodities across-the-board and womens’ bodies will just be “special” compared to mens bodies because of their ability to carry babies.
52 2018-02-06 21:04:11 ESMA is in the process of raising margin requirements for retail clients (stocks,FX, commodities, etc.). It is mostly CFD but it may have far-reaching consequences (especially for crypto as it is now much easier to trade it on most retail brokers). The rise is substantial (10x).
53 2018-02-06 21:03:43 Well that’s good.  But you breed sheep, don’t you?  They are commodified.  Or do you run a sanctuary?  If animals are sentient and not commodities, then you’d oppose buying/selling them or the “products” made from them.  So it’s a bit confusing.  You’re a vegan at heart 
54 2018-02-06 21:03:31 Because commodities are portable and property isn't.
55 2018-02-06 21:00:51 If that is so then why not lower the price of other commodities by restricting their production? Set a bread quota and bread will be cheap?
56 2018-02-06 20:49:20 Extended families (grandparents, parents, siblings, children, etc.) are valued all over the world. Culture, family customs, and love for all families staying together should be preserved at all costs. People are not commodities, in any century.
57 2018-02-06 20:49:11 Probably not because, while we both appreciate welfare improvements, I don’t see animals as commodities but as sentient beings with rights (so distinct from welfare) not to be used/killed for our wants (most of us don’t need to eat/wear etc animals).  Thanks for the chat.
58 2018-02-06 20:48:44 Your currency, however, remains fiat, unbacked, and still losing traders on commodities. Good luck on spinning wheels or just going backwards.
59 2018-02-06 20:47:26 your not getting it are you? the head of the Rothschild family has charged interest on virtually every currency issued worldwide for over a 100 years(including china), and in some cases 400 yrs. and reinvested it in commodities.

82 2018-02-06 19:40:03 #Gold and #silver, like other #commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
83 2018-02-06 19:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
84 2018-02-06 19:33:51 tells, as in what's behind this wild volatility...is it commodities in general? or just binge on oil, because of dollar weakness
85 2018-02-06 19:32:34 Yeah, that's fine (and maybe even interesting for arbitrage) in many 'asset classes', like commodities, but Bitcoin is meant to be a currency FCOL, where such high volatility makes it worthless in that function & not much use as an SoV either. It's a Ponzi used for arbitrage!

95 2018-02-06 18:54:37 Markets are adjusting to rising interest rates and inflation. However this will be accompanied by high growth and big jump in corporate earnings especially in emerging markets. Equity prices always rise as and when earnings grow. So be ready for big jump in commodities +earnings^

99 2018-02-06 18:34:06 I’ve been watching it closely. Intriguing. But bottom line, unlike commodities, there’s no underlying asset in which to value it against. So it’s (wild) fluctuations are based purely on sentiment. It’s a ‘sell’ for me, just like the dotcom bubble.

122 2018-02-06 17:28:55 My query to unions and people on strike,  we want our salary hike at the proposed tym but price hike in basic commodities isn't acceptable,  why? Don't farmers and Aahdti needs hike in their basics selling price? Y do v make hue &  cry when fruits, vegetables price hikes
123 2018-02-06 17:24:46 The question is whether human rights is the means or the end. As a means, law struggles to regulate expression commodities (money, data, etc.) which inevitably encode social systems. Part of why the private & civil society roles are SO important.

242 2018-02-06 11:07:41 Stock market tanking is not unexpected. Day after Trump was elected, the bond market dropped as currency was shifting from bonds to stocks. Now with rising interest rates, they'll be a shift back into bonds. Only issue is if currency shifts to commodities or real estate.
243 2018-02-06 11:07:38 Yes I truly believe that commodities are a better play specially the ones that are more advanced,it’s picking the right ones that is the important plan. Copper Gold Silver and some others always do well.

246 2018-02-06 10:58:27 Weak US Dollar = strong oil and commodities generally = strong Russian stock market. No wonder Russia loves Trump

248 2018-02-06 10:55:41 This TRAIN Law doesn't work for most Filipinos. Almost everything is expensive. Your tax became lower but the prices of basic commodities became way higher. #NoToTRAINLaw
249 2018-02-06 10:53:15 A lot of equity volatility investment products being blamed for the speed of the sell off. Tail wagging the dog. 

This is somewhat evident given the lack of volatility in other areas such as bonds, currencies, and commodities.
250 2018-02-06 10:50:41 Commodities, FX markets calmed... Yield slower (flight to safety "working" not destroying portfolios)
251 2018-02-06 10:47:16 Legacy markets dropping, crypto doing the same. Where all the clever £$€¥ gonna go?! Bonds and commodities for the short term then its all coming to crypto....when the old men realise we are migrating to the future.  blade runner shit.
252 2018-02-06 10:45:55 Commodities posted positive returns during the Oct 87 crash. This appears to be taking the same shape
253 2018-02-06 10:40:46 Also, speculative bubbles in commodities, even digital ones, are not Ponzi schemes.
254 2018-02-06 10:35:02 Feels like the next 2 months rally could actually be led by commodities... with oil holding on here at least good valuation support for energy equities

308 2018-02-06 07:28:36 @namo_office  Dear Sir, Crude oil market is down but still you people daily increase oil price in India. Do you think you are doing a great Job. A big No because it's directly or indirectly affect the normal people as a high Inflation and price hike in other commodities.
309 2018-02-06 07:23:34 Didn’t say “person” said “someONE” as opposed to “ someTHING”.  You see them as commodities, objects, production units, things so as to rationalize violence against them.  You won’t find morality in a dictionary, those definitions change in step with moral progress. See history.
310 2018-02-06 07:18:12 Why are the banks so interested in protecting their customers from falling Bitcoins @Bulldozer0 ? They never stopped their customers buying falling shares, derivatives or commodities… ‘spose it was “ok” to buy their@toxic derivatives …
311 2018-02-06 07:15:29 No no no.

Markets will crash more on open.  Fed will have no option but adjust rates to prevent a free Fall.  Dollar will soar.  Commodities will tank.

318 2018-02-06 06:49:43 Will our economy be based on commodities given the volatility of this market in past few years? I think there  is a need to diversify our economy than to just base it on commodities

326 2018-02-06 06:08:52 I don’t think it’s inflation. Investors seem to be worried that profits will be hurt by slightly better wages. Commodities are falling as well, and that seems inconsistent with inflation.
327 2018-02-06 06:07:34 Commodities are down, TIPS aren't even back to their Thursday levels...investors don't agree with you. This looks like profit-taking, not flight to safety.
328 2018-02-06 06:04:46 I would argue the same point for health care - humans, their health and lives, as commodities for profit...SHOULD NOT BE.
329 2018-02-06 06:04:27 He’s s time waster- As Corbo said that ship has sailed - tariff was not even an issue during Brexit debate - it is a bonus - we are confident prices for commodities will drop - confirmed by experts
330 2018-02-06 05:57:37 It's kind of interesting... Despite a stock market correction, people aren't fleeing to cryptocurrency (as those prices continue to plummet) or commodities such as gold.
331 2018-02-06 05:42:25 Don't u think this bodes well for commodities. Commodities were long due for a correction on upside.

340 2018-02-06 05:04:39 The article shows how corporate investment is buying and consolidating properties to build new projects that exist as asset banks and speculative flippable commodities. It is an actual global real estate phenomena, that is destructive to urban fabric.

360 2018-02-06 03:52:19 What's the safest position in a volatile market? Forex? Or do you short commodities that would take such a knock the hardest?
361 2018-02-06 03:51:40 A misnomer. 70% of an export product derives from imported commodities and raw materials. A weak dollar makes imports more expensive hence driving up the cost of our export pricing. This makes US manufacturers less competitive in global marketplace. It also drives up US inflation
362 2018-02-06 03:48:31 Keep talking.  Your face and your dad’s man boobs will be HOT commodities in prison... #trumptits #jrtits
363 2018-02-06 03:41:01 How are the commodities doing?
364 2018-02-06 03:37:51 short answer is I think dollar to strengthen and hurt EM and don't think commodities really break out yet.
365 2018-02-06 03:37:11 Study of all the historical inflection points of the Jakarta Futures Exchange seems to indicate that—let alone if he'd chosen a vastly different commodities market to put all his wealth in 15 yrs ago—Chamomillionaire would probably not be a Rooibillionaire trading solely on teas.
366 2018-02-06 03:34:40 Your new phone convo with Rod Blagojevich came out today where you talk about black People like commodities and laugh and Rods racist ‘joke’.

You’ve spent more than Trump in his primary. You are corrupt.
#BissNotBillionaires
367 2018-02-06 03:27:31 Is it time to trade commodities? WE HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THE WORST!  I am actually being somewhat serious. We’ll see.
368 2018-02-06 03:24:34 That, and you would think that with all of the fears of inflation, internationals tied to commodities / inflation would have picked up....but nothing...yet anyway.
369 2018-02-06 03:20:16 Baba Ram dev now is lucky to manufacture Modi patanjali pakoras also like all other commodities.
370 2018-02-06 03:16:59 I thing this is one of the big issues with markets taken over by ETF traders. When people sell their SPY positions, the baby gets thrown with the bath water. This should create opportunities for non-ETF traders. Look at underlying commodities which seem to be holding up...
371 2018-02-06 03:15:08 Mikolas had numerous offers and calling Gregerson and unknown is odd. He’s been one of the most known commodities in RP for the last decade
372 2018-02-06 03:11:57 Public and private pension plans taking a big hit this week...stocks tanking and #FOMC poised to jack rates bringing down bonds as well... I like commodities here.
373 2018-02-06 03:06:26 Commodities roared after GFC meltdown
374 2018-02-06 03:02:45 She must have gotten the same commodities advice as Hillary. Remember her $1,000 “investment” that magically transformed to $100,000 while she was the First “Lady” in Arkansas?
375 2018-02-06 03:02:17 Inflation is indeed high today, what w/ the buying power of the peso against the skyrocketing prices of commodities. But along w/ the rising inflation is the uprising of idiocy in men & arrogance of leaders w/c numb us to the very core of our existence. We're a sorry State.
376 2018-02-06 03:01:47 Commodities and gold aren’t worried.
377 2018-02-06 03:01:01 Bought XAGUSD 16.93 #gold #silver #trading #goud #zilver #beleggen
378 2018-02-06 02:51:47 Live by the stock market...die by the stock market. Also it’s a poor comms strategy to message around it as most people don’t understand it nor does it impact wages or job growth. #markets #stocks #commodities #economy #bonds
379 2018-02-06 02:49:41 He says buy commodities. Is Tide pod a commodity?
380 2018-02-06 02:47:36 Pero caerían commodities
381 2018-02-06 02:46:58 Yeah but he did say he liked commodities... #CL_F
382 2018-02-06 02:45:13 I'm always looking for efficiencies. We make high-margin, custom products. Full automation is not suitable for us. Implementing software always takes 4x as long as estimated & then you're on the upgrade/customization treadmill. We don't make commodities, I don't need speed 1/
383 2018-02-06 02:44:47 Buy stocks,sell commodities is that what I'm hearing
384 2018-02-06 02:44:41 Have to worry about herd behavior.  So much uncertainty having to do with tRump and any number of global economic variables.  I've moved a little more into hard commodities like copper, at least for the short term.
385 2018-02-06 02:34:22 Parte de la tesis es que el dólar va seguir bajando, que causa suba de precios de commodities que benefician los paises emergentes...
386 2018-02-06 02:21:07 The uncertainty surrounding Tether has made crypto investors uneasy, an unease that became alarm when Bloomberg reported that Tether was subpoenaed by the US commodities trading regulator in December.
387 2018-02-06 02:19:12 Learn something about  agricultural commodities and international trade, then it makes sense.
388 2018-02-06 02:10:51 Closed Sell XAGUSD 17.05 for +6.0 pips, total for today +6.0 pips #gold #silver #trading #goud #zilver #beleggen
389 2018-02-06 02:09:16 So I just checked my portfolio to survey the damage after today’s market bottom-out. Fortunately all the buffalo nickels are still there. I’m about to review my commodities holdings as well, so think good thoughts for my vintage TV show-themed novelty watch collection.
390 2018-02-06 02:08:38 “Let me explain to you how commodities futures work”  great film
391 2018-02-06 02:08:28 It has no value except the value people place in it. Same for a lot of other currencies, this is why they say to keep 10-30 percent of your networth in tangible commodities.
392 2018-02-06 02:07:51 And that's when sh!t gets surreal when you think about the fact that computers are dictating the price of real commodities.
393 2018-02-06 02:04:51 Just mobilization for a much bigger take-off imo.  Being patient, and buying more energy equities as I can afford to do so.  We are still in winning territory here.  All those lost dollars will look for a new home in the undervalued sectors like energy, commodities.. I think.
394 2018-02-06 02:02:43 PTJ is the man! Seen Trader doc like 30 times. He believes like D Tepper that commodities are starting a cycle that will bring inflation with it
395 2018-02-06 01:54:03 Abolish drugs from your life and you will feel less dependent on capitalist commodities.
396 2018-02-06 01:40:36 Nasdaq down, S&P 500 down, Bonds down, Commodities down, PSEi down, Crypto down...  4 days to CNY, we can do this. 
397 2018-02-06 01:40:11 Would you rather she depend on the government to meet these goals?  Got to start somewhere.  Maybe Hillary could teach her about commodities trading?
398 2018-02-06 01:36:50 Sit  there can't be smoke without fire. This is the reason why Madam Sitharaman is quiet or else she would have refuted immediately. Her silence now also indicates that she feels such Majors are disposable commodities. She needs to clear the dust in her own interest in particular
399 2018-02-06 01:36:46 good opportunity to accumulate stocks that helps economy - especially commodities crash is india's gain
400 2018-02-06 01:35:52 Sooo yeah.. about that stock market #stocks #commodities #NASDAQ
401 2018-02-06 01:34:44 My sister's argument for not throwing away our blunt knife is that if we keep discarding commodities when they become dysfunctional, we will start discarding people the same way when they are of no use to us.  #FairEnough
402 2018-02-06 01:32:45 Well its really an opportunity for the Commodities stocks which has positive effect on economy .. so in one sense meltdown is good for India
403 2018-02-06 01:21:24 All reviling for a bunch of millionaire egos. NFL isn't football it's a financial investment and the millionaire Eagles are nothing but Commodities and should be traded on the market and when they screw up well you know the rest
404 2018-02-06 01:19:54 I object to your use of commodities to describe the mares, or horses,  for sale. Desensitizing people to awareness that these are living,  breathing animals that we are accepting into our care promotes disregard  for the well being of the animals in our sport.
405 2018-02-06 01:11:35 Salvation is Fund Security and Commodities to protect the German Population.
406 2018-02-06 01:08:22 Part of the issue is they confuse “food” (stuff we actually eat) with “commodities” (like feed corn, soybeans, and so on).
407 2018-02-06 01:05:04 3179: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
408 2018-02-06 01:03:15 Charles asks a question: what does TW think about ppl gambling over vital commodities?
409 2018-02-06 01:01:03 @narendramodi sir yr Govt should go to micro problem of ppl than take, food/ vegetables commodities should control,other price no body worries, farmers should get better price,same time ppl should get better price.difference should born by Govt .no subsidies
410 2018-02-06 00:59:00 and the privacy of having reasonable control over who shall make inroads on your time and when, are rare commodities in most of this world, however, and they have nothing to do with the orientation of windows.

413 2018-02-06 00:53:46 Well.  Maybe the money will flow into the commodities.  We need it
414 2018-02-06 00:48:55 It's almost as if the supply and demand for labor responds to the same pricing rules as other commodities: you bid higher, you get more people applying but if your bid is too low, no one has any to sell.

417 2018-02-06 00:37:20 2 of 2:  A lot of people who bought bitcoin at 20,000 dollars per coin disagree with you that "bitcoin is safer than gold, stocks, almost all commodities and cash."  To them, Bitcoin is not safe at all.
418 2018-02-06 00:37:03 An we also sell it through our own Commodities Exchange instead of profit and tax revenue being attributed to London?
419 2018-02-06 00:29:07 Commodities are due for a run, inflation will occur due to Fed’s balance sheet. Whether or not this is the beginning I cannot answer but I feel it is time to start, everything but oil
420 2018-02-06 00:29:02 The war on drugs is a decrepit facade, the capitalist state wants you to get high on commodities.
421 2018-02-06 00:24:41 Commodities are the safe haven at the moment.  Copper staying strong #ARS.  Gold holding its recent gains #HUM and although oil has come off slightly from its high #SDX looks like its sat right on support so all offering great entries. 
422 2018-02-06 00:23:46 $OZL too. Commodities looking like a winner after this washout
423 2018-02-06 00:19:59 Não vejo assim...

Os mercados são tipicamente cíclicos...  E as empresas passam por mudanças. Novas tecnologias, aquisições, ciclos de capex, ciclos da economia, preços das commodities, novo entrante no mercado. Tudo isso faz com q as empresas possam estar trabalhando subótimas
424 2018-02-06 00:19:45 We all know Russia  and China  smuggle lots of commodities to North Korea  and this since the first Korean War in the 50ties!
425 2018-02-06 00:06:57 Who will be the biggest NFL free agent offseason commodities?
