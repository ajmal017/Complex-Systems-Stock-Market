9 2018-11-30 23:58:29 I really think the snake oil salesman got in over his head. He should be offered a chance to resign and take his Entourage with him. The real villains here are the people that enabled him !
10 2018-11-30 23:58:28 Thats not true actually, in the 80s global price was still high during Alberta recession,thanks NEP, and the harm now is not from global oil price, its from current governments standing on the neck of Alberta.
11 2018-11-30 23:58:27 He's a snake oil salesman. He has such arrogance that he actually thinks he sounds intelligent.

17 2018-11-30 23:57:39 The US has 1,500-2,000 cases of Malaria a year.

The number will increase as the climate rises, which is due to the Ag & oil industries.

37 2018-11-30 23:57:07 Canada doesn't buy oil. Private businesses do. He's not "virtue signaling" when he is speaking about a real problem that needs to be addressed.

43 2018-11-30 23:56:23 Today, I had the opportunity to ask our federal government if it plans to support Alberta's initiative of purchasing additional rail cars in order to reduce market access backlog and avoid cutbacks in oil production. Please see below the question that I addressed in the House.
44 2018-11-30 23:56:20 It's a fair point that dumping oil is a mechanism to help ensure long-term demand by spurring capital investment in petroleum burning vehicles.
45 2018-11-30 23:56:19 ん？
46 2018-11-30 23:56:18 Trump reverses restrictions on coal and oil.
Refuses to go the way of clean reusable energy. 
Pulls out of Paris climate agreement. 
Puts sanctions on Iran oil.
Russia, Saudi Arabia are biggest winners. 

This is Trump's payback to them for not releasing whatever they have on him
47 2018-11-30 23:56:13 How will increasing the supply help the workers? It will depress the price of oil even further! Do you suggest Canada subsidize a dying industry instead of retraining its workers?

54 2018-11-30 23:55:09 Thank you! I didnt know sunlife covered it. I don't rly know how the legalization of weed in canada affects CBD oil because the authorized sellers only offer edibles and weed
55 2018-11-30 23:55:04 It defies even good oil’ mansplaining!

57 2018-11-30 23:54:58 Sadly, evidence takes a back seat when it comes to infertility remedies. Some patients will opt for snake oil to avoid hopelessness, uncertainty and regret. The good news? Those are some of the cases where #psychotherapy can help.
58 2018-11-30 23:54:53 Coal,oil&gas,are an essential link in the carbon cycle, life cycle.Hence its immeasurable value. You demonize them. The message must be the opposite.Without CO2&reduced carbon,the future´ll have glaciation.We must take care of the reservoirs of hydrocarbons.Can you understand it?

 Why don't you move all of y'all Venezuela?
60 2018-11-30 23:54:44 When you're counting calories, but to gain weight rather than lose weight, you end up doing some weird shit like adding 2 tbsp of olive oil to your soup because that's 200 calories.
61 2018-11-30 23:54:30 Buying a pipeline is a weird way of phasing out oil.
62 2018-11-30 23:54:28 Honestly I bought 10 from beedewy bc proceeds go to helping save the bees. Kept one for myself and gifting the rest. I roll my rose hips oil with it and regular moisturizer and my skin has been so glowy!!

If it doesn’t produce, He’ll place  the nozzle in the center of the State where Leonard “Loser” Lance lives. The world will shit out NJ politicians
67 2018-11-30 23:53:34 Anything claiming to be the saving grace of someones channel is no better than snake oil. There is no substitute for hard work and time. Everything else can only be supplemental.

71 2018-11-30 23:52:41 I love my husband even more when he picks up my car at work and gets an oil change for me. But, for real. 
72 2018-11-30 23:52:23 While the Trump admin's actions or lack of actions are truly despicable, I understand that it really must hurt Russia. Oil prices falling again.
73 2018-11-30 23:52:18 So the last three days resulted in cramps, hot lavender oil baths and crying from my pain I got throughout the day time ... no wonder I woke up feeling better than the last few days because my endometriosis flare has finally gone down 
74 2018-11-30 23:52:17 Offers to supply oil??? Cuz they were holding off before cuz they didn’t like India’s human rights record??? They were already supplying oil to India and they increased supply in October 2018...Can we please have real accurate influence free reporting please please....

79 2018-11-30 23:51:54 Trump lowered oil prices? Yea sure he did ... not how the oil markets work Jimmy.
80 2018-11-30 23:51:54 Honestly, the screenshots I have of new leaf are higher quality than this oil pastel crust piece.
81 2018-11-30 23:51:46 Where is his concern for the "social  implications " of importing all that oil from a male dominated regime? What an asshat!
82 2018-11-30 23:51:43 Oh no, she solved it by suggesting we all move . I am not sure if she ment all 4.2million of Albertans or just oil workers?

I was among the first people who said if he is putting travel bans, he should start with Saudi Arabia’s citizens because of the sponsorship of terrorism. 
I hope world was an ideal place too! It’s not
87 2018-11-30 23:51:31 Ummmm... You can sell your own oil on the world price of like 60$ a barrel. You buy Canadian oil for like 13$  barrel.

You should be buying Canadian oil like crazy and selling your own.
88 2018-11-30 23:51:21 Drenched my head in coconut oil hoping for a miracle
89 2018-11-30 23:51:19 Pass a law that fines oil companies $10,000 for every barrel of oil that washes onto the NJ shore or into NJ waters. Make the fine applicable to every corp involved. Very doable.
90 2018-11-30 23:51:18 with the US cancelling the Russia summit and Congress trying to end Yemen assistance could MBS and Putin react by cutting oil production?
91 2018-11-30 23:51:17 It was the biggest set up in history. I watched it all go down step by step flight AA11 till UA 93. I saw them cover up a crime scene at the Pentagon and then haul ass to Afghanistan. The Patriot act was a result from years of trying to get it into play. We have control over oil

98 2018-11-30 23:50:01 Also, some etymology from the late great Gil Marks: “latke, derived from Ukrainian word for pancake/ fritter, oladka, by way of Greek eladia (little "oilies") ultimately from Greek elaion (olive oil). Elaia (olive), by way of Latin, is also the source of the English word oil.”

103 2018-11-30 23:49:34 Why get off oil? There are at least hundreds of years worth left, and we all know climate change is a total hoax
104 2018-11-30 23:49:16 Well I'll say this: what other oil in the world is more expensive to extract than Alberta oil? The answer is none. What magic do you think will happen to make that untrue?

112 2018-11-30 23:48:03 I agree, but in this case he’s just virtue signalling, if he really believed what he said, he would apply his “gender based analysis” to everything including Saudi oil that comes into Canada, wouldn’t you agree?
113 2018-11-30 23:47:59 Historically it has gone the other direction: oil prices drive consumer vehicle choice. SUV sales are up because oil is cheaper, not the reverse.
114 2018-11-30 23:47:51 Over thanksgiving we made this crazy parsnip confit, which means we have all this parsnip and rosemary infused oil in the house and, Reader, lemme tell ya: it fuckin' rocks

117 2018-11-30 23:47:24 I doubt the Russians are fans of the Saudis, considering their oil competition and fight against each other in Syria.

119 2018-11-30 23:47:21 I think it was a marketing decision by UCP. Western Canadian Select isn't even the cheapest Alberta oil. That distinction goes to Hardisty Light, currently selling at $12/barrel. WCS sounds more Albertan and has seen a MUCH bigger price drop than the overall Canadian Crude Index.

121 2018-11-30 23:47:10 Apparently you guys actually don't pay attention to the actual energy industry at all LMFAO if you did you would probably realize energy companies including oil companies are already looking at future technologies for safer cleaner energy.

142 2018-11-30 23:45:30 Isnt the point of an asset its relative valuation versus other assets? You can price gold in dollars, oil, copper, silver, SPX, etc. All assets have a relative valuation. That is what made bitcoin hard to value, there was no relative valuation history.
143 2018-11-30 23:45:28 @RepWalterJones @SenatorBurr @SenThomTillis: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast
144 2018-11-30 23:45:27 Yup. Same study showed that the Hope Diamond is essential worthless because there's only one of them and that gas prices spiral upward when OPEC and Canada are at maximum oil production. #Economics

147 2018-11-30 23:45:10 Someone come give me a free oil change I need one bad 
148 2018-11-30 23:44:53 The USA is drastically increasing their oil production. In 5 years they won't need our oil and will restrict Canadian oil and we can make a oil tanker monument out of the not required oil tankers!!!
149 2018-11-30 23:44:45 Did you know that there is very little oil there?
150 2018-11-30 23:44:42 My friend’s uncle’s bookie’s dental hygienist’s boyfriend’s dog’s veterinarian’s brother is a delivery guy with Skip the Dishes and said he just delivered $200 worth of Chinese food to the Leafs brass. Gotta think they’re burning the midnight oil on this Nylander thing.
151 2018-11-30 23:44:34 So I put in like pounds of coconut oil in my hair cuz this mfka was dry dry and  WHY TF DO I DO THE SHIT I DO TO MYSELF  Like there’s coconut oil EVERYWHERE  On my neck on my nose on my forehead in the car...  I can’t with myself
152 2018-11-30 23:44:31 They say, Trump, denies climate change. Not true Trump disagrees on the cause. We know burning coal, & oil pollutes but America does it the most climate-friendly as any country. The big polluters are China & India ETC but they attack President Trump. Attack the polluters, not

156 2018-11-30 23:44:06 Q has responded to an Anon saying they’re saving Israel for last. That’s only possible if Trump takes control of the Fed and cuts off the dark money/oil.
157 2018-11-30 23:44:05 I’m curious about the oil pipelines that run across the state???  any news??

159 2018-11-30 23:44:02 dermalogica precleanse is honestly sooo nice, the oil is thin, nicely fragranced and luxiourious feeling and it rinses so clean like ughhh i love skin care
160 2018-11-30 23:43:51 The USA is drastically increasing their oil production. In 5 years they won't need our oil and will restrict Canadian oil and we can make a oil tanker monument out of the not required oil tankers!!!
161 2018-11-30 23:43:42 So you do two separate mixes? One for the underpainting and one for the next few layers? Oil painting scares me so im really curious
162 2018-11-30 23:43:40 That’s a considerable increase compared to what’s been happening up until now. In 2017 total oil exports from the POV were only 1.7M tonnes and a Aframax Oil Tanker carries 650 000 barrels X 1 per day = A lot more! And this activity is proposed for right through Metro Vancouver!
163 2018-11-30 23:43:39 They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters, and meat, and shit-eating drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring god damn cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.

165 2018-11-30 23:43:30 Clove oil! Nothing works better. It'll come in a kit... Or sometimes the pharmacy will have it.
166 2018-11-30 23:43:26 The fact is trump needs Saudi Arabia to keep the oil price down, and to take mullahs in Iran down (as he said himself).
He doesn’t care about a member of Muslim brotherhood that was killed because of internal conflicts.
167 2018-11-30 23:43:22 The USA is drastically increasing their oil production. In 5 years they won't need our oil and will restrict Canadian oil and we can make a oil tanker monument out of the not required oil tankers!!!

174 2018-11-30 23:42:39 All elected officials should have to pay back taxpayer money used for settlements or, say, misuse of private jets, or sweetheart contracts for cronies for Puerto Rican infrastructure or contracts for oil surveying in formerly protected lands. Glad to hear you'll be first!

180 2018-11-30 23:42:11 I once decided to make my then GF, a nice dinner of eggplant parm. Eggplant parm was mistake one.

183 2018-11-30 23:41:59 He took care of a super-generous supporter, Warren Buffet.  Buffet's RR had exclusive transport contract for crude oil to the refineries.  Environmental excuse was a ruse to disguise pay to play because the Keystone was using existing gas Pipeline ROW to cross the wildlands.

187 2018-11-30 23:41:43 No thanks to all of those in plastic... except flying.  They're making great progress on solar planes.  Oil is the past.  Great options in the future.
188 2018-11-30 23:41:40 One man’s opinion is not a thorough debunking, especially when some of his funding seems to come from big oil through Friends of Science (maybe). And even if it isn’t 97%, it is clearly a significant majority, and the concept of a conspiracy amongst them all seems very unlikely.

190 2018-11-30 23:41:23 Both of them have a hughe leverage (oil, gas, money).Trump is more ore less handcuffed politically and both have their agenda in the Middle East. I guesd we'll see something happening there.
191 2018-11-30 23:41:16 Keep yelling it Lisa during the discovery of oil ,they dumped the left over useless  junk into the river ,,cause there was no use for it ,,,oh until the need for gasoline ,was invented ,,and that junk Was gasoline ,oh Only the Only most used  substance on earth Xrp\gasoline
192 2018-11-30 23:41:14 It does, but this isn't MaBell or Standard Oil. Getting something like that done, especially in the courts as they stand, won't take an Act of God, but something awfully close.

208 2018-11-30 23:39:32 We need to take a long term secular view.  Religious differences really hinder prospects for peace and development.  The region needs to get smart, develop economies that don't rely on oil.  Climate change and the decline of oil as a key energy source will impoverish the region.

210 2018-11-30 23:39:21 Finally went and got me some MCT Oil as well as a keto replacement meal thing. Let’s see where I go with this!
211 2018-11-30 23:39:11 
212 2018-11-30 23:39:09 I'd like to see two things happen at once. A clear plan for Canada to move away from fossil fuels and a recognition that Alberta needs to sell it's oil today. They have reason to be angry at the lack of concern.
213 2018-11-30 23:39:09 これが嫌で3回天井したけど来なかったんだよ...
214 2018-11-30 23:39:08 The production and delivery of oil products, natural gas and electricity in Canada contributes about $170 billion to Canada's $1.8 trillion gross domestic product (GDP), or just under 10%.
Revenues from the #TMX a fraction of that and with little profit at these oil prices..less!
215 2018-11-30 23:39:05 My car drive so much better since I got an oil change
216 2018-11-30 23:39:05 Adopting policies that wage war on the car and our oil are also doing the trick. You managed to shut down a GM plant that’s been in Oshawa for over 100 years. At the rate your going we will have no manufacturers left in the country.

225 2018-11-30 23:38:31 @PnPCBC I do not think that the NDP govt. should be buying oil cars.  by the time they a re constructed it will be too late.  There is also the issue of rail capcity. We have up to  70 trains a day travelling through our Alberta Town. That is one every 10 min. in 24 hour period.

年末に利益が出過ぎたと大慌てしても合法的にセーブする手段はほとんど残されてない。グレーか黒。

税金のことは年初に考えよう。
227 2018-11-30 23:38:15 maybe a red colored zoned and active dough pillow with a red essential oil like strawberry or cherry, something of the sorts because that would be awesome.

229 2018-11-30 23:37:56 Corn oil works but,it is more expensive currently. Of course if the fed didn't pay farmers not to farm corn maybe it would be cheaper.
230 2018-11-30 23:37:47 Excellent. Hope to be down with the bottle.
231 2018-11-30 23:37:30 If by "helping" you mean drilling for oil, you do know that will make it worse, right?  It is almost as if you received a science degree from trump university!  #FailingBigly
232 2018-11-30 23:37:24 Pre the 2016 meeting oil collapsed from 50 to 41 before rebounding to 46 pre meeting then 51 day after the meeting.  65 to 50 in the last 4 weeks, back up to 56ish pre meeting and 63 by month end! Same shit different year
233 2018-11-30 23:37:09 Isn't that a helpful piece of advice? Oil sands may well not be the future but they are now. Why shouldn't Albertans earn a good living until that  wonderful utopia comes about?

236 2018-11-30 23:36:47 According to pundits back on the mid 70’s we should be out of oil now.  Now there is no guess.... er... prediction as to when that might be.  I would not bet my lunch on tomorrow’s forecast!
237 2018-11-30 23:36:46 It's a pseudoscience/quack medicine/snake oil/not scientifically backed. @JordanHasay does it, or at least has done it.
238 2018-11-30 23:36:44 Ay, so that's how it's done pala. Pwede ring Otosol? Or better baby oil?
239 2018-11-30 23:36:38 what’s a good oil to use on your body?

249 2018-11-30 23:35:16 technical analysis is snake oil
250 2018-11-30 23:35:02 True. At least they have work to go to unlike many in oil and gas.
251 2018-11-30 23:34:56 We had oil-by-rail under #cpc #stephenharper and it was a complete disaster They choose oil over wheat The result was a long long long wait for wheat farmers to get to market "The backlog" was a disaster for farmers #cdnpoli @pnpcbc @vassykapelos #epicfail #albpoli #factsmatter

256 2018-11-30 23:34:09 So you want me to wish high gas prices for myself and the rest of the world simply because Alberta hasn't figured out how to do business with reasonable oil prices????  And didn't this happen under Harper's rein?
257 2018-11-30 23:33:39 But it seems you've built a straw man to attack, since nothing about this suggested anyone was defending gas or oil except for your implication.

This is why I think we see this a different way....
258 2018-11-30 23:33:37 All the oil you have to put to fry it good and all the oil it sucks up. Hundreds and hundreds of calories
259 2018-11-30 23:33:35 I think there’s not much slack in the system after all cuts to capital spending by oil majors around 2015. Oil was bid up when Trump was threatening sanctions on Iran and raised expectations of shortage, but now that is not happening due Trumps exceptions, calls now unwinding.
260 2018-11-30 23:33:33 Sorry, but it was the Last Straw about six straws ago. This is just disgusting, blatant pandering to oil company lobbyists.
261 2018-11-30 23:33:27 At least Trudeau knows that Canada does not import Saudi oil. Private companies do. Bible school dropout who spent 9 years in government should know that as well.
262 2018-11-30 23:33:20 Oil company hired mercenary: *unloads M80 from helicopter into humpback whale* "oh sorry I didn't see that whale there"
263 2018-11-30 23:33:13 maybe i'll find a margarine substitute instead. like olive oil
264 2018-11-30 23:33:06 You can clear a lot of forest in a month (+ detection time). That gives me great confidence - not. I’m boycotting palm oil & would advise everyone else to do so. I still can’t believe that conservation orgs who happily receive donations for forest conservation are behind this. 
265 2018-11-30 23:33:03 アイチュウくん所持枠は石砕くからいいけど常に90000万超えててゲリラとかするとすぐ溢れるフレポなんとかして欲しいなぁ
266 2018-11-30 23:32:59 1 tablespoon is 120 calories of an oil I have in my crib. So imagine if you actually measured when you pour oil to fry something (just to know )

268 2018-11-30 23:32:45 Ship less from China? So those same wealth business men will volunteer to make their now, say $2 products here for a lot more money? And green energy tax incentives and transit improvement are part of most carbon tax plans. Oil is oil & creates CO2 no mater where it’s comes from.
269 2018-11-30 23:32:44 And please resist the mountains of money big pharma and big oil will throw at you all the time. Thanks and good luck.
270 2018-11-30 23:32:22 I don’t know what that means - what’s the endgame? Is this only for oil and gas projects? Would this apply to construction workers of a new Boeing plant?
271 2018-11-30 23:32:21 
272 2018-11-30 23:32:11 You’re ok with corporations crafting smear campaigns against private citizens who criticize them? Seriously? If you criticized Exxon over an oil spill and their executives launched an oppo/smear campaign against you: cool with that? Is that ethical behavior?
273 2018-11-30 23:32:10 Since #IranSanctions deadline n #Kashoggi #Trump is more erratic. He humiliated himself in Europe during Armistice celebrations. He lost Congress. Battle to lower oil prices is probably lost n he will blame KSA and Russia. Nafta was rebranded. Xi is only option to save anything.
274 2018-11-30 23:32:05 #GrowingUpMuslim is not being able to eat french fries at an American restaurant because it was fried in the same oil used to cook the chicken nuggets.

276 2018-11-30 23:31:58 Did the opposition come from ag? Or oil? Both?
277 2018-11-30 23:31:51 I was millennial but I just bought an essential oil diffuser and I am now a boomer
278 2018-11-30 23:31:48 Maybe the Canadian government isn't going to tell private business where they can buy oil from? Maybe the market isn't as simple as this partisan sock account thinks and regional supply chains preclude being very picky about where the il comes from?
279 2018-11-30 23:31:47 It’s notthesamegradeofoil. Stop lying.
280 2018-11-30 23:31:42 It is, burning the midnight oil working and these guys are keeping me company!

284 2018-11-30 23:31:25 94 East at 5 pm is a litmus test for Milwaukee drivers to see if they’d actually prefer being waterboarded with motor oil.

286 2018-11-30 23:31:14 I can change my tires, oil, brakes and do radiator/coolant flushes with supervision, but I can’t put windshield wipers on.  Thanks stranger!
287 2018-11-30 23:31:11 They said they can’t guarantee the oil sales but other trades. The major portion of the Iranian exportations is oil and natural gas and their by-products. So it must be admitted that the deal won’t provide any benefits, except that of a tool to put the pressure on the us

292 2018-11-30 23:30:48 You know you live on a dirt road/have a dirty car when the oil change employees say they thought your car was two tone color
293 2018-11-30 23:30:45 christ.. now mj follows me.. could he be less obsessive? i'll block him now. the ole oil face.
294 2018-11-30 23:30:35 I don’t think people realize how much oil is used when you fry something 
295 2018-11-30 23:30:31 You don't follow the news. MBS cracked down on corruption and took back billions from the family to create a sovereign fund to move Saudi away from oil dependency. That's why Kershoggi etc were plotting against him. The murder became news right before a big investment summit.
296 2018-11-30 23:30:25 @ToyotaofSM @Toyota David Leroy - General Manager promised to give me a coupon for an oil change after refer my friend to buy the BMW X3 .  that never happened.  so don't believe what this guy says.  and his sales people - rude too.  discriminated me

302 2018-11-30 23:29:59 Hints of a strategic thinking in @DaveGoulson piece, sadly can't reconcile with reality of single issue crop protection bashing. We can afford to import sugar and oil lost from UK production as result of no NNI STs, World cant afford to lose more ha's of tropics growing it for us
303 2018-11-30 23:29:58 Yes. And both Mrs Oil and I could make a fine steak pie. (Now, there's an idea for the new year...) Are you at Stockbridge Mart before Christmas?
304 2018-11-30 23:29:42 ROPEC is going to cut next week and save the shale oil guys. It will be interesting to see if any shale drillers thank them for it or just contribute more profits to Trump's next campaign fund.
305 2018-11-30 23:29:38 Approximately 336,000 gallons of crude oil spilled from a severed pipeline into the Peruvian Amazon on Tuesday night. Did you hear about it? Thought not.

323 2018-11-30 23:27:23 And people wearing awful, cheap toupees stand out like oil on water.
324 2018-11-30 23:27:22 What's even more bizarre as that oil by tanker from Vancouver, just gets shipped down the US coast most of the time.  Meanwhile the Hibernia offshore drilling in Newfoundland gets shipped by tanker over seas, while people complain about Saudi Oil being imported to Irving refinery

331 2018-11-30 23:26:48 I'm not sure where I heard it, but the point was made that we tend to see the war in Iraq as a mistake and a failure. But if you're a defense (war) contractor, a logistics firm, mercenary organization, spy, consultant, oil company, it wasn't a failure. It was an enormous succsss.
332 2018-11-30 23:26:47 Every Tweet from Kenney promotes only one thing, oil. The problems Alberta has had over the years have all been because the Cons refused to diversify and put all of their eggs in one basket, leading to recession every time oil tanked. It will be exactly the same under this clown.
333 2018-11-30 23:26:34 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.

338 2018-11-30 23:25:43 Or did he say we had increased oil production on his watch?
339 2018-11-30 23:25:42 We blame Notley !!!!!
Anyone in Oil & Gas knows she has been going through the motions & does not appear to work for us 
My guess would be Tides 
She did go their gala to celebrate

344 2018-11-30 23:25:27 And in this video he claimed that and in this video he claimed that being dominant in oil production was his creation?

 Must be all the OIL in Alaska .
354 2018-11-30 23:24:37 Canada should nationalize the oil at least then we keep all profits like Norway instead of a measly $3. a barrel now.
355 2018-11-30 23:24:34 So do you think we should continue to sell arms to dictatorships committing human rights violations and killing innocent people as well as driving them from their home countries?  Or is this just about oil?

370 2018-11-30 23:21:54 Suspect TMX/oil perdurance is much greater when given IP vs PO. Therefore, dietary maybe worse than bolus.
371 2018-11-30 23:21:46 Oh nice. I might try to save up and get one then. We don’t always have a chance to go to the store to reup on oil.

Hello December
381 2018-11-30 23:20:37 Today America is a net energy exporter. MBS is producing record amounts to hurt Iran and at the same time preparing to reform his economy for the post oil age. He cracked down on corruption. That's why they want to replace him.
382 2018-11-30 23:20:34 I agree though I caution that oil did this in 2012, then turned around...which just formed a less steep trend line.
383 2018-11-30 23:20:22 Is that oil? Girl. Props to you. I always forget that it takes years to dry, so most of my work ends up on my hands.  Lol. Oils ain't for me, but you got great patience and talent. Awesome work so far!
384 2018-11-30 23:20:22 You are peddling snake oil. #StopBrexitSaveBritain

388 2018-11-30 23:19:17 Oil sale finessers on their bullshit lol
389 2018-11-30 23:19:16 Do you think they were so chumming because Saudi and Russia  agreed at the G20 earlier to reduce oil output dramatically to get the price back up to $80 bbl? Nobody that’s chumming for no reason

391 2018-11-30 23:19:05 Indeed she is. 

Monday I will post you a pic of a meal I make. It's going to be good, or bad lol.. 

My new love, is white truffle oil.. God I do love truffles.
392 2018-11-30 23:18:59 I have never seen a post from Jasen Kenney or any of his supporters speaking about Trump, let alone praising him. However you cannot argue that oil jurisdictions in the US and elsewhere are doing well, (except Venezuela) while Notley and Trudeau destroy ours.
393 2018-11-30 23:18:46 I firmly believe in oil pulling - Medical experts agree it's for the best.
394 2018-11-30 23:18:41 Two biggest oil producers in The World. Now, what could this possibly be about?
395 2018-11-30 23:18:35 And to boot, foreign oil doesn't have to have the emission standards of domestic.
396 2018-11-30 23:18:34 My mum used slim fast for years in the 70s and got no where except a lot of heart ache and food probs! Nothi g has changed maybe except some of the ingredients. I mean, to even include FRUCTOSE and CANOLA OIL means they don't care what they give to ppl. Profits give margins!
397 2018-11-30 23:18:21 Pardon my French, but feck the market.  It is so up its own arse right now, I really have no desire to try to rationalize with the blathering idiots that trade oil. I'm looking for a structural improvement in the system that balances the market. A sizeable cut is step one in this
398 2018-11-30 23:18:20 I'd probably change it myself if I had the proper equipment. Plus, getting rid of the old oil and filter seems like a big hassle.
399 2018-11-30 23:18:18 you cannot drink or eat oil

404 2018-11-30 23:17:50 THE SAUDI CROWN PRINCE IS LAUGHING BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT PUTIN ,TRUMP THE EU,  ARE ALL IN HIS BACK-POCKET, THE WESTERN COUNTRIES WILL ALWAYS SHAKE HANDS WITH A CRIMINAL WHO HAVE OIL AND A LOT OF MONEY TO SPEND IN THE ECONOMY OF THE WEST !!
405 2018-11-30 23:17:48 Warri.

Warriors, battle-ready, furious

Furious tricycles spit fire on tired roads

Road, dirt and dust racing down its cheeks 

Cheeky kids stagger the streets, drunk with crude oil

Oil-pregnant wells seduced by empty promises

Promises made; debts unpaid

406 2018-11-30 23:17:41 @pepboysauto why do you use old oil in your oil changes? This is one of the “dirtiest” things I’ve seen for a large company like yours.
407 2018-11-30 23:17:38 @Valvoline Hi, on your game where I won an oil change, it’s impossible to update the location, even when I follow the directions on the Contest FAQs. Just letting you know, because I’d love to be able to use it!
408 2018-11-30 23:17:20 I'm an oil portraitist. It's literally fine art. It's not a brag, that's a categorical descriptor.
409 2018-11-30 23:17:16 i use coconut oil religiously
410 2018-11-30 23:17:06 i had a roommate who actually stole furniture out of my room & then lied about how it got in her bedroom. she would drink my beer all the time, partied till all hours of the nite. she wrote all over her bedroom walls with oil paints. I moved out...
411 2018-11-30 23:16:58 You're the crudest oil, let your vision boil
Yeah, they're gonna dig a coal-face out of you
412 2018-11-30 23:16:39 anyways my oil diffuser seems to be clogged or broken because it keeps turning itself off even when it's full and I'm so close to giving up and throwing away this darn thing 
413 2018-11-30 23:16:33 Did you see Vladimir, getting street with the rich oil murderer. Funny old world.
414 2018-11-30 23:16:32 seriously loving my hair but still a bitch to do it because of this winter my hair gets dry too so like weekly oil is necessary and less heat lol but im loving it :))))
415 2018-11-30 23:16:12 EXCELLENT!!  More Oil & Gas Exploration!!
416 2018-11-30 23:16:10 Coconut oil is good every once in a while, but don’t use it too often. Since it’s a oil, overuse will clog your pores! I learned the hard way. 
417 2018-11-30 23:16:05 Do you put butter and sugar in your covfefe or olive oil? 
418 2018-11-30 23:15:55 I need my oil change but it cost too much
419 2018-11-30 23:15:54 dont forget the beard oil, it"s beyond essential
420 2018-11-30 23:15:25 DM me about CBD oil, I’m tryna learn all about that shit 
421 2018-11-30 23:15:22 Cbd oil
422 2018-11-30 23:14:54 I don’t drink coconut oil and my identity is a secret. Only @fnafilms know who I am. I don’t actually go to the match either as I’m not keen on football really.
423 2018-11-30 23:14:52 You know it's a joke when a joke is leading the chart 
Is thie some chart made by some oil company?
424 2018-11-30 23:14:42 This is  terrifying. Their sonar was mislead by oil platforms or the roaring sound of the engins of  boats?
425 2018-11-30 23:14:22 @RepSarbanes @SenatorCardin @chrisvanhollen: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast
426 2018-11-30 23:14:10 *Energy diversification is essential for our economy. Oil sands are outdated methods of energy and cost more money to manufacture than we actually profit from, not to mention the horrendous environmental destruction and disregard for indigenous communities.
427 2018-11-30 23:14:08 Bro Obama just bragged about how *he* made America the biggest crude oil producer in the world, what are you talking about?
428 2018-11-30 23:14:07 'tis the season to start basting myself in coconut oil. #winterishere #everythingisdry
429 2018-11-30 23:13:56 นอนไม่หลับ
430 2018-11-30 23:13:52 Cooking my final project for Seed Root and Bloom tonight 
The menu:
•Salad with fire cider dressing
•Nettle soup w/microgreens
•Shepard’s pie with fresh burdock root (usually when herbalists use it its dried)”meat”, slippery elm gravy, and CBD olive oil potatoes
431 2018-11-30 23:13:50 True. My oil painting is in sump oil. Picture of an athlete..... running everywhere....
432 2018-11-30 23:13:48 If state intervention results in economic success, why isn't the country with the world's largest oil reserves (Venezuela) & significantly more state intervention than Chile, economically successful? Why isn't Cuba more economically successful than Chile? Anyone in Latin America?
433 2018-11-30 23:13:38 What...the snake oil didn’t work
434 2018-11-30 23:13:37 CBD oil isn’t illegal anymore...it’s marvellous for anxiety in my experience.
435 2018-11-30 23:13:28 A friend of mine took the best ass pic I’ve ever seen by rubbing coconut oil all over her ass do you can try that too
436 2018-11-30 23:13:27 Ronald Reagan went to Saudi Arabia and persuaded them to lower the price of oil around the world. It bankrupted the Soviet Union. Russia's entire economy is based on oil. We already have more oil than they do, so why would Trump follow Putins lead?  Your statement is dumb.
437 2018-11-30 23:13:06 Oil or money.....
438 2018-11-30 23:13:02 Who will be the first moron to blame the earthquakes on man made CO2?  Quick, you need to sacrifice a virgin and your SUV to make the planet safe again. Snake oil salesman should be clamouring to take advantage of a catastrophe
439 2018-11-30 23:13:02 i just applied facial oil like a youtuber/of beauty guru i am Luxurious

442 2018-11-30 23:12:47 It’s okay, there there!

I’ll meet u for a pint tomorrow and bring some coconut oil and massage your ego till you feel better 
443 2018-11-30 23:12:43 15 minutes and regular oil.
444 2018-11-30 23:12:34 It's 42 degrees and the roads are getting slick. It's the oil mist
445 2018-11-30 23:12:30 Abolish planned obsolescence, annihilate oil subsidies and tax oil. There's a market pressure that will motivate development in other directions. Cut military spending, most of it is straight up wasted, just wasted.
446 2018-11-30 23:12:23 And in context of the ideological war on renewables, as China's population rises out of poverty, we need it to prioritise non-polluting energy. We can't afford new markets for fossil fuels.

Rent-seeking behaviour by the coal & oil industries needs to end now - in every country.
447 2018-11-30 23:12:04 They are no oil paintings either !
448 2018-11-30 23:12:02 maybe switch to CBD oil. I has the calming effects and inflammation reduction without all the paranoid side effects.
449 2018-11-30 23:12:00 And most likely an hour + of his time. Is that synthetic oil Gawee?
450 2018-11-30 23:11:55 What about Puerto Rico and Flint?!
Oh, yeah, there’s no oil there...
451 2018-11-30 23:11:54 So you’re actually taking credit for both those epidemics. Both created by corporate greed.

Opioid epidemic was created by the same kinds of companies that make weapons systems. These run on oil.

It’s simple.
452 2018-11-30 23:11:31 じゃあ、私も聴きますー
453 2018-11-30 23:11:29 I love Cast Iron cooking as well, I always do my cornbread in cast. Have a griddle in the oven right now at 400 with cooking oil on it. Getting ready for some winter outside cooking. You are amazing with Cast-iron cooking. I am watching!!!! Lol May have more time to cook someday.
454 2018-11-30 23:11:26 Kenney: Socialism is bad.
Big Oil: can we get some socialism?
Kenney: Sure, I love you guys.
Albertans: Hey, what about...
Kenney: shhhh
455 2018-11-30 23:11:09 寝ちゃダメぇえ良いお天気だよぉおおお
456 2018-11-30 23:11:00 Bernie you always complain about oil, wall street, big business, pharma and the lack of caring for the environment. What I want to know is if you complain about all of this stuff then why do you invest your money in them.
457 2018-11-30 23:10:59 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
458 2018-11-30 23:10:58 What has Narcissistic Don done for anyone? He's so grimy he'd throw his own mother under the bus if she was living. There's a reason why he lost his homestate of New York..they know he's a Con. Glad you like the taste of the Fool-aid Snake Oil, you're gonna need after Jan. 3rd!
459 2018-11-30 23:10:56 I recently discovered how much easier it is to remove makeup with olive oil than with disposable makeup wipes. Doesn’t hurt my skin as much either! And you’ve always got olive oil!
460 2018-11-30 23:10:52 CBD oil won’t help!
461 2018-11-30 23:10:46 I read some white mom tips for migraines and one of them was "if you're feeling nauseous pour some essential peppermint oil on a cotton swab then rub it on your nostrils" and it was pretty ridiculous but I've tried it and it actually helped, OK
462 2018-11-30 23:10:41 That's where the Nymex oil contract came in and "Atari Oil", as the old timers in Monahans called it, saved the exchange in 1983 (after heating oil).  Interestingly, one of the first people I traded physical oil with in 1980 was named "Spud" Westmoreland. #OOTT
463 2018-11-30 23:10:36 Neither the NDP nor the LIBs are responsible for the price of oil or the U.S. shale revolution resulting in excess sweet crude and natural gas.  There is absolutely nothing anyone can do to save jobs in an oil glut.
464 2018-11-30 23:10:32 In addition, Gwyn Morgan was a big investor in the oil and gas business and during the time he was a BC Liberal advisor, the province was withdrawing from receiving a material share of natural gas production. #bcpoli
465 2018-11-30 23:10:30 あの時のBBの言葉はスッゲー嬉しかったなー…
466 2018-11-30 23:10:29 I've paid the cost of this OIL...
467 2018-11-30 23:10:25 the cutest guys just changed my oil and Im mad cause I didn’t get their numbers)):
468 2018-11-30 23:10:12 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
469 2018-11-30 23:09:56 Motor oil and cardboard between them, nastyyyyyy 
470 2018-11-30 23:09:52 Castor oil baby!! And vitamins!! And satin pillow cases !! My hair is doing good and growing and I melted it the fuck offfff hahaha
471 2018-11-30 23:09:52 Allan dumped the fryer oil down the sink cause it wasn’t hot enough. #focusingonasolution
472 2018-11-30 23:09:43 The Gold finches started showing up 10 days ago just a few for 6 days thought I was going to get a big eruption but then bam  & happily several Harris & lots of White Crowns also my Black oil Sunflower seed consumption tripled
473 2018-11-30 23:09:37 Look at all that motor oil 
474 2018-11-30 23:09:28 twits I need help. does anybody take anything over the counter to knock them out for sleep? I’ve tried prescription meds, CBD oil and gravol. Have an important psychiatric assessment in a few weeks and literally need to just make it to then.... but my sleep is soooo off and
475 2018-11-30 23:09:27 Just imagine if the Conservatives used their decade in office to get Northern Gateway built, instead of putting no political capital behind it and letting the courts and Trudeau kill it. Now we have to listen to you explain how supply managing the oil sector is good. Fun.
476 2018-11-30 23:09:16 And how fabulous that the oil is described as having been used to oil swords  to prevent corrosion.
477 2018-11-30 23:09:16 Feel bad for all those affected, but STOP VOTING GOP (anti-climate change) when you live on the Ring of Fire & don't further screw up your state and livelihoods by drilling for oil in wildlife refuges. LEARN FROM THIS.
478 2018-11-30 23:09:09 Russia would be foolish to keep pump like they have. It's a waste of their resource which they could sell for much more. The shale oil glut will stop producers from producing more shale oil. Low prices cure low prices.
479 2018-11-30 23:08:58 Trump owns MBS now and is making KSA pay for his support. This week KSA forked over $15bn for THAD system which pre-#Khashoggi they would have bought the Russian S-400 for a third of the price. In the face of collapsing oil prices KSA can't cut production b/c it will anger Trump.
480 2018-11-30 23:08:58 Ichh masih jaman land oil
481 2018-11-30 23:08:54 Should I post my school art on here? This quarter has been primarily oil painting but I'll be doing more as I go full time. (Plus figure drawing again soon!)
482 2018-11-30 23:08:43 Go B-Shepp.
483 2018-11-30 23:08:36 I know all of us liberals are supposed to rail against Wells Fargo for funding oil pipelines, and abusing consumers with numerous infractuons. There is more to the story. I will expand on that but can people stop telling me I’m ‘the man’ for working for this bank?
484 2018-11-30 23:08:35 Be worried about s kot more. Also left for dead this week: Commodities, oil, rates, housing, autos, GDP. Many layoffs announced, corps guiding lower and more. US is so out of whack with the world YTD.
485 2018-11-30 23:08:33 Salt and olive oil. Nothing else needed
486 2018-11-30 23:08:20 @cathmckenna Min. why can't hydrogen not be used to reduce carbon. Hydrogen can be harvested from oil after scrubbing it or produced with power cells. Imagine  powering your house, heat & elec., and filling your car with hydrogen all with the same cell
487 2018-11-30 23:08:20 What should Trudeau do? Threaten a wall if Trump does not drop the tariffs. Cut off the oil exports? Give him some advice based on your "vast" experience of international affairs and dealings with dictators.
488 2018-11-30 23:08:09 Do y’all really get your oil changed every 3k miles? Asking for a friend
489 2018-11-30 23:07:56 Back to the future.  It was always a hub for oil.
490 2018-11-30 23:07:56 It's misting. Weird that it has an oil base to it
491 2018-11-30 23:07:53 the presidents brother BOUGHT VOTES to protect big oil and nobody seems to care
492 2018-11-30 23:07:51 oil andy
493 2018-11-30 23:07:45 No he’s their boyfriend now, look for another guy
494 2018-11-30 23:07:39 4. Carbon tax (w/possible surtax on oil derived vehicle fuel) matched $ for $ w/other tax cuts for no net increase in overall tax burden.
495 2018-11-30 23:07:25 Market just dgaaaafffff - oil next
496 2018-11-30 23:07:21 Fine, fuck the carbon tax, but you need to embrace green energy and abandon oil's sunset industry. Big oil does not have a place in a modern economy.
497 2018-11-30 23:07:16 Obama needs to wake up and smell something, I don't know what but something to shock his brain cells into life because if he can't remember shutting down coal and oil production by refusing bills supporting oil drilling, pipelines or coal mining. His empowerenent of the EPA
498 2018-11-30 23:07:14 You would think that the oil industry would cutback production on their own, if it was in their best interest. Are you sure forcing production limits would protect jobs?
499 2018-11-30 23:07:00 But we love their oil & military purchases. Actions speak louder than words or tweets so we know where the US stands
500 2018-11-30 23:06:56 Think about what's going to happen when Trumpity Dumpity has a whole sale in ANWR oil drilling.  Mother Nature will respond in kind.
501 2018-11-30 23:06:50 Now when fellas say they working in the “oil” it really means doubles not Petrotrin
502 2018-11-30 23:06:30 North Sea Oil.
503 2018-11-30 23:06:24 My grandmother always used rosemary w/spuds. She'd trudge to Soho for garlic, queue for fish from what became Mr. Fish the hairdressers, and buy her olive oil from Boots. 

I remember young Jamie podding broad beans & playing footie. Two courses for £12. Happy days.
504 2018-11-30 23:06:12 I don't know if the intention is to sell "snake oil" as it seems to be addressing even one of the issues gives you some result and something is better than nothing. I've been at this a long time and I don't see too many programs specifically addressing all four underlying issues.
505 2018-11-30 23:06:11 You are not helping Sen. Graham.  We will have Russian bases in SA shortly along with 200.00 barrels of oil.  Well done.  But point well taken.
506 2018-11-30 23:06:10 今日でようやく折り返し。あと6勤
507 2018-11-30 23:05:59 Almond oil! A couple drops and apply as a serum 
508 2018-11-30 23:05:58 He actually screwed the Saudis pretty heavily in this situation... Khashoggi is a different situation and I'm not thrilled with what they're doing... Claiming the actions (or lack of) are due to national security. Not related to oil.
509 2018-11-30 23:05:55 Getting Oil Changed..
510 2018-11-30 23:05:44 While it's a sad story I know people years into this who are destitute. For all the millenials chirping that it's oil price & Notley & Trudeau can't control it.
They have & they did by blocking pipelines! 
Once Notley is gone ALL options, including separation, are on the table.
511 2018-11-30 23:05:40 You got 0.1 in Russia possibly Putin checking charts of oil decline ...watch out Mueller might subpoena you for “Collusion”
512 2018-11-30 23:05:40 How I go to get an oil change and a new wheel bearing but not windshield wipers 
513 2018-11-30 23:05:17 the National Marine Fisheries Service needs to support green energy and not big oil!
514 2018-11-30 23:05:15 そうだろ((
515 2018-11-30 23:04:52 Today i washed my car for the first time in forever and it’s still acting like it needs an oil change. Like bitch what more do you want from me??
516 2018-11-30 23:04:38 Strait Glass!! Oil base 
517 2018-11-30 23:04:16 Oil and killing machines that's all they are bothered about.
518 2018-11-30 23:03:51 I hear ya I’m on a project not oil and gas but I fear when this is done I’m done
519 2018-11-30 23:03:49 How much does it cost when you change your own oil?
520 2018-11-30 23:03:42 Which is crazy because we need it more!! Our beards coil up and need extra moisture. I've been using just pure unrefined coconut oil for mine and it's been pretty well. Still think I should mess with other oils though.
521 2018-11-30 23:03:37 KAI always cooks really spicy curry with a lot of chili oil to it... It BURNS!;;
522 2018-11-30 23:03:36 BTW- basil oil nominated for MVP ingredient!
523 2018-11-30 23:03:33 I don’t bother with vinegar: just press the passion fruit pulp and seeds through a sieve and add good oil and salt. Also excellent on beetroot
524 2018-11-30 23:03:27 Rocket Man disses Oil Slick.
525 2018-11-30 23:03:22 You forget ‘Snake oil salesman’...
526 2018-11-30 23:03:21 Is there some kind of oil, or pill i can take??
527 2018-11-30 23:03:11 Correct, and that spread should tighten before oil can go back up.
528 2018-11-30 23:03:09 Please don’t support the pink is all I’ll ask, thank you
529 2018-11-30 23:03:04 I’d like to recommend a Fiorentina with extra pepperoni. With lashings of both chilli oil AND garlic oil. Try it. You won’t turn back.
530 2018-11-30 23:03:02 me: aye yall got any....... motor oil
mcdonalds employee: ???????
me: secret menu
531 2018-11-30 23:03:01 The worst kind of people are the ones that comment “Try CBD oil” on videos of people with Epidermolysis Bullosa
532 2018-11-30 23:02:58 ｗｅ ｄｏｎｔ ｔａｌｋ ａｂｏｕｔ ｏｉｌ ｍａｎ
533 2018-11-30 23:02:57 I disagree. I think they are both incredibly intelligent and both know what they are talking about. Highly respect both. But sadly @cathmckenna cannot be a climate leader and stand behind big oil. TM cost would pay for AB to get off the pipe.
534 2018-11-30 23:02:57 べんきょーするぜぇー
535 2018-11-30 23:02:54 Diluted tar sand bitumen is not even oil.
536 2018-11-30 23:02:52 On the plus side..while extracting CBD hemp oil may be a problem for now, using the whole buds is not. That's what I demanded in my lawsuit. It's a violation of my freedom of religion to not be able to make the Holy oil as is required by my Faith. Someone is listening...
537 2018-11-30 23:02:49 my dad got me a freaking beard oil instead of an essential oil............ idk if it’s shady or not but i feel slightly disrespected
538 2018-11-30 23:02:43 ;-; I volunteered to help clean up wildlife in the event of an oil spill <3 wow I'm happy that I get this opportunity but sad for the lil animals :c
539 2018-11-30 23:02:32 I have never in my life paid for someone else to change my oil.
540 2018-11-30 23:02:30 おっちゃん起きたよ
541 2018-11-30 23:02:27 Do you know why those oil regulations kicked in? Do you know why he imposed them? Common....try hard, think about it. Why did his administration come up with all of these regulations? What triggered it? Or did he just impose them because he's a muslim who hates America?

4/20/10
542 2018-11-30 23:02:18 Ye might gae a wee bit o' wax adhering tae yer eardrum. Ah hid that wan time an it widnae budge for onyhing. Try a wee bit o' almond or olive oil on a bit o' cottonwool overnight. See if it helps.
543 2018-11-30 23:02:07 Dumbass progressives that continue to LIE to themselves about how great obama was. Had drilling bans on oil+fracking but claims he is the cause of USA surge in production. Let vets DIE as he sent BILLIONS to Iran. Obama destroyed healthcare+now the sheep, believe Dems will fix it
544 2018-11-30 23:02:03 Ummmm...Isn’t Lucas Oil Stadium an indoor venue?
545 2018-11-30 23:01:57 Nothing more hardcore than listening to Smile Empty Soul's 'Bottom of a Bottle' while finishing my Fish Oil.
546 2018-11-30 23:01:40 So in other words you agree with the crown prince these 17 were responsible for the murder.  All of the other implications of the prince  etc were false.  So now move on and stop Saudi oil.  Use Alberta’s instead! #cdnpoli #abpoli
547 2018-11-30 23:01:36 Do you expect oil prices to hold steady in the light of an increasingly viable alternative?
548 2018-11-30 23:01:33 The fuck he does. He’s a lying sack of shit, a con artist, a snake oil salesman, a fraud, a pretender, a bullshit artist. He is one of the worst apologists out there and his only function is to provide comforting lies to assuage the doubts of believers. Nothing about him is...
549 2018-11-30 23:01:30 awao sana oil
550 2018-11-30 23:01:24 @RedlerAllAccess Hey bud can u please please cover oil Before OPEC after 8 consecutive down weeks in a row ???
551 2018-11-30 23:01:14 Global equities this week sure look diff than US equities and we've had some bad economic data. Oil and rates collapsed, debt and deficites ramp, housing and autos dead, layoffs abound, GDP revised for restocking 1.8ish. US inv sees no downside to any circumstance
552 2018-11-30 23:01:10 @MotoSolutions You can help me with the gas and oil contact in Mexico to see the trunking line and marine band products on platform, tanks.
553 2018-11-30 23:01:08 Too bad Canada isnt an oil rich country.

555 2018-11-30 23:01:07 I just left with a couple tubes of oil and it’s very good. Thanks @ThePeakOK
556 2018-11-30 23:01:03 Marine oil spill recovery is a joke. Look what happened in Newfoundland and that wasn't even dilbit.
557 2018-11-30 23:01:01 What’s the gravity on that Oil?
558 2018-11-30 23:01:00 Oh I thought we’re going to just touch butts and rub oil over em but THIS is a better idea’ >:3
559 2018-11-30 23:00:53 According to @jomcnally Men on their 20s “Don’t make love to ya they drill you for oil!”  #blamegame
560 2018-11-30 23:00:48 You guys where awesome 
561 2018-11-30 23:00:46 Blend 2 quarts eggplant with 2 1/2 pints Cabbage. Mix in Olive Oil. Freeze for 9 hours. Serve warm.
562 2018-11-30 23:00:40 I feel the last 25 years the party has been girded by the interest of big banks, big pharm, oil, venture capitalists even private prisons. 
Bill Clinton deregulated Wall Street and started mass incarceration. He criminalized immigration in 1996
563 2018-11-30 23:00:36 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
564 2018-11-30 23:00:36 It is very frustrating when the "label" of dyslexia is co-opted for convenience of packaging by companies selling snake oil style learning programmes
565 2018-11-30 23:00:35 I DUNNO WHATS YOUR FAVORITE FOOD
IF THEY DONT GOT IT ITS FINE!!! I COULD PUT MY OWN OIL ON THERE I GUESS

569 2018-11-30 23:00:21 Check out what the base oil is. I have seen it in olive oil, coconut oil,and almond oil. You might be reacting to that.
570 2018-11-30 23:00:21 Wow! A conservative oil exec. What can he possibly have to say about Obama???
571 2018-11-30 23:00:17 @RickSantorum your comments on @CNN regarding scientists who lie about climate change for money are idiotic. Big Oil and Energy are the ones “funding” the @GOP view that it is a hoax. Why? Don’t assume that we all put Money and Party above all else because you do.
572 2018-11-30 23:00:11 Would love something signed by the D man!
573 2018-11-30 23:00:06 This girl at my work asked me where i got my lashes done and when i told her it was just mascara her jaw dropped  i always remove my eye makeup with coconut oil because its more gentle on my eyes and the benefits are long thick lashes♡
574 2018-11-30 23:00:06 I also found some more milani lip oil on clearance!! got lemon honey this time
575 2018-11-30 22:59:30 What’s some good oil choices?
576 2018-11-30 22:59:29 อยากกลับไปอยู่กทม มีเหตุผลอยู่ที่นี้ ละมีเหตุผลกลับไปอยู่กทม. แต่ทำใมเหมือนกลับไปกทมไม่ใด้
577 2018-11-30 22:59:27 Saudi oil problem solved. They will cut us off. Gonna get chilly this winter.
578 2018-11-30 22:59:15 Same guy says Global Warming is a threat and must be addressed.....I guess he meant after oil is over.
579 2018-11-30 22:59:11 @jomcnally absolutely knocking it out the park on #blamegame 
Drilling for oil.. the girl knows it, the oldies are the best 
580 2018-11-30 22:59:09 1)El gobierno anterior decidió subsidiar hasta 7,5 el gas nuevo, plus, para incentivar la actividad en nuestro país, en el caso de Vaca Muerta para que su exploración o estudio no creara pérdidas a las compañías. Así se hizo Loma Campana shale oil. es discutible si fue correcto
581 2018-11-30 22:59:08 Engine oil
582 2018-11-30 22:59:06 Low oil hurts their economy & the Saudis know they're 1 mass protest away from their own 'Arab Spring' which Iran would exploit eagerly.
583 2018-11-30 22:59:02 Potential Pike’s Lagoon villain who polutes the water with oil and trash
584 2018-11-30 22:59:00 Originally majored in history because I wanted to go to law school (thank you Cosby show). Sought a Ph.d. in history because I fell in love with teaching while working for Shell Oil co. (thank you corporate America). Have always loved history because it encourages thinking.
585 2018-11-30 22:58:55 With all the Oil and NRA money you can afford a new tie
586 2018-11-30 22:58:52 For best results, take one statin with a double shot of soybean oil. Your heirs will thank me later
587 2018-11-30 22:58:49 Do you change your own oil, T?
588 2018-11-30 22:58:48 Had to learn that there is indeed frozen Pizza I can't eat because it has (too much) olive oil. Now I feel sick while I have to try to fall asleep. 

Thanks life.
589 2018-11-30 22:58:47 And North Sea Oil!
590 2018-11-30 22:58:45 USA made most of its money in 1940s by being a supplier of arms to Allied Forces. And then in 50s & early 60s by being a provider of construction material to battered Europe. And continues to meddle for oil & natural resources.
We don't want such growth at cost of human lives.
591 2018-11-30 22:58:43 The same story that hit oil and mlp feb 26 2016
592 2018-11-30 22:58:43 Your taxes are going to big oil.
593 2018-11-30 22:58:40 I wonder how many oil spills have been written off the minds of everyday people
594 2018-11-30 22:58:37 Sure he was just coming to pick lettuce. 

Elites and their families with their walls, cameras and armed security are never victims, just the common people suffer.
595 2018-11-30 22:58:37 FX reserves, debt issues, and raising non oil revenue. a mix of three.
596 2018-11-30 22:58:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
597 2018-11-30 22:58:11 @KTrevorWilson cmon brother. You cant tell me rootbeer scented beard oil isn't enticing u a little bit.
598 2018-11-30 22:58:10 honestly underestimate how lucky i am to work for an aromatherapy company. acne- tea tree essential oil, car accident- girls made a cream that is better than the codine i was given, an old scar- another fucking cream and this bitch going, neck strain- a lavender wheat hot pack
599 2018-11-30 22:58:10 stop selling them weapons and buying oil. otherwise just shut your mouth.
600 2018-11-30 22:58:04 I’ve been asking my mom to find an essential oil that gives me spider senses for months now and she has failed to produce, so needless to say I’m skeptical of the power of essential oils
601 2018-11-30 22:57:41 Aye, but there's no oil left
602 2018-11-30 22:57:35 @syscokid87 hi you can help me with the gas and oil contact in Mexico to see the trunking line and marine band products on platforms, thanks
603 2018-11-30 22:57:31 HOLY FUCK. HOLY SHINT. WHAT KINDA FOOD WOULD WE SELL
I DONT THINK THEY HAVE MOTOR OIL BUT ILL SEE WHAT I CAN DO!!!!
604 2018-11-30 22:57:27 Have you ever taken into consideration the social and economic costs of the laid off oil and gas workers struggling to make ends meet while unemployed.
Your mantra is “We must do this for our kids”
Your carbon tax has a direct affect on children today with no decreases in GHG.
605 2018-11-30 22:57:23 we don't talk about oil man
606 2018-11-30 22:57:21 The pipeline issue is very serious. Oil is at 50 plus a barrel but alberta producers only get 10 to 15 a barrel because they can’t get the product to market.  We should be booming now, we are in deep trouble when we hit the next rescission.
607 2018-11-30 22:57:19 Very interesting chart Kevin, I know it is not your area of interest, but have you got any insights on commodities that you might share ? Oil E+P whilst hesitating looks friendless..
608 2018-11-30 22:57:12 This joke means that money or oil always wins...
609 2018-11-30 22:56:55 asked tyler if he wanted pancakes for dinner and he goes “yeah i’ll bring the motor oil you get the cardboard”
610 2018-11-30 22:56:53 Texas lands another big HQ leaving California; Paxton sues San Antonio for sanctuary city actions by police; Reality in Texas higher education funding discussed; Oil & gas rig count; Texas rainy day fund & legislative spending + much news of Texas, 5 to 7pm on Pratt on Texas.
611 2018-11-30 22:56:51 Great info! Is the 30mg x 4 doses a day mean 4 doses of 7.5mg? Or 120mg per day? Is that straight THC or CBD?

This is for my mom. I gave her some high CBD Rick Simpson oil in some pill caps and she ended up getting high. Too high to use her walker. Maybe not high enough in CBD?
612 2018-11-30 22:56:32 Misplaced priority. Should we be talking about oil output or 24/7 power supply?
613 2018-11-30 22:56:32 Gua kira belajar tentang essential oil gak serumit ini ternyata bikin otak gua cukup panas :'v
614 2018-11-30 22:56:24 Unlike Puerto Rico, which isn't full of oil and Republicans?

Thug.
615 2018-11-30 22:56:22 Weird thing is I use toothpaste even if acne trying to appear. I love the coconut rose hydrating face oil from Tjmaxx like $6. It helps heal the scar. Another thing I use for acne face wash, it’s very light it’s called “Bliss” fabulous foaming face wash and Triple oxygen instant
616 2018-11-30 22:56:19 Nothing to do with automation. Oil has recovered everywhere else. US companies are hiring people hence a lot have left. What's killing oil in Canada is current government and lack of pipelines period.
617 2018-11-30 22:56:18 I think they are in palm oil plantations.. 
618 2018-11-30 22:56:16 Is the underlying problem the fact that there are significant oil fields in Xinjiang and China wants to assimilate/eliminate the Uighurs before they try to separate?
619 2018-11-30 22:56:09 That is untrue. It’s a prediction of less growth over 15 years. Christ don’t talk to me about projections that’s the biggest laugh I’ve had in years after the snp oil projections. I was thinking you might be ok but you  either lie or are blind
620 2018-11-30 22:55:59 Ashe kagane
621 2018-11-30 22:55:59 The more actions that stabilize the industry, the more these issues disappear. Build routes to markets that can get our oil to world price and more families will move to the area, more activities outside of a bar will be wanted. Pipelines can mitigate some of the boom and bust.
622 2018-11-30 22:55:55 Drop that sucker in a 55 gal drum of oil and hit it with 1.21 gigawatts!!!!
623 2018-11-30 22:55:53 basil garlic and olive oil is my new trifecta. I may have garnished with some watercress too.
624 2018-11-30 22:55:43 She should have taken the pay off in oil, less of a paper trail.
625 2018-11-30 22:55:35 Oil is a part of everything  your cloths !! Also saudi is the leader of islamic world  
626 2018-11-30 22:55:34 You are missing the point. Treat the industry fairly by subjecting everyone to the same rules. Including Saudi oil and the automobile industry. All should be subjected to same rules. Can you imagine counting downstream emissions of every car built?
627 2018-11-30 22:55:18 "Sick man of Europe" and lots of oil
628 2018-11-30 22:55:05 I'll be glad when the oil runs out. We wont have to rely on these vile people.
629 2018-11-30 22:54:59 Le tapamos un par de inyectores y a la mierda , y hacemos que large gas oil crudo por el escape jajajajaja
630 2018-11-30 22:54:56 The majority of people who voted, heard Hillary loud and clear.

The malcontents, insecure white supremacist and bigots heard the castor oil salesman with no scruples who is waist deep in criminal behavior and is the butt of MBS and Putin Jokes.
631 2018-11-30 22:54:54 has he stopped arms deal with saudis yet? or stopped buying their oil? .... no balls jihadi justin
632 2018-11-30 22:54:50 Hmmm, after I got laid off from oil company I have opened my own company not related to petroleum, but sure I don't understand how markets work 
633 2018-11-30 22:54:45 Michael realized that Trump is a piece of crap doesn’t care for anybody But himself and money finally somebody stands up to Donald J Trump tells it like it is must be very embarrassing to all the Trump supporters out there who realize they been Buffalo by a snake oil salesman
634 2018-11-30 22:54:44 I say.. Bring it on and see what happens. If US can absorb loss of oil influence, terrorist Intel among other things, great, then humble Saudi Arabia. If not, time for US to be humbled for its arrogance. BTW, what's Isreal going to say?
635 2018-11-30 22:54:40 The role of these journalists is to point to alternatives not buy into the pols talk. Albert's and Canada can no longer rely on a "resource" (read oil) economy. The solution here is a redefined economic base. The issue here is climate change! Not moving carbon resources. #pnpcbc
636 2018-11-30 22:54:33 Girl I don’t know the brand or anything but I tried this cbd lotion/oil that you rub on your body & it feels like Vicks & feels AMAZING. I’ll try to see exactly what it is but I highly recommend. Just puts you in chillax mode  10/10!!
637 2018-11-30 22:54:28 Please throw more accurately, use your eye and scan more and please stop stepping back and move in and either run or throw . Love your passion and I’m glad your a Cowboy! Looking forward to having you long term Dak!
638 2018-11-30 22:54:12 I also spilled orange essential oil on my lip somehow.
639 2018-11-30 22:54:09 If you have no other options there, moving is the only one. Natural gas put hundreds of thousands of coal miners out of work. Towns died. Protests aren’t killing oil and gas jobs, automation is.
640 2018-11-30 22:54:05 If they cut 10% (2 MMBD) oil goes up 40% so yeah they understand the math.
641 2018-11-30 22:54:03 As I remember when I signed up to join the Brotherhood of (ECV) at the Rip Old age of 27 first stop  was a Mud Pit filled mud & Manure @cspanwj no Wession Oil 
They did serve me Breakfast raw eggs pancake batter on top my Head w Log Cabin
642 2018-11-30 22:54:01 Big Oil's massive 'donations' to Sec Clinton provocated her attack on oil-rich Libya but she had no After-Plan other than Exxon stealing region's oil. Region then became dangerously unstable & conducive to ISIS growth; Hillary will destroy anything for money, exactly like Trump.
643 2018-11-30 22:53:58 Hope they stop selling oil to Canada as well.
644 2018-11-30 22:53:50 I do not think they are laughing about oil prices.
645 2018-11-30 22:53:43 He should have just unzipped his pants and pissed all over a toy oil rig on stage.
646 2018-11-30 22:53:42 If only more oil could be pumped, the land would be so much more stable...

649 2018-11-30 22:53:26 I'm sure that @POTUS won't let the oil drilling industry and their seismic activities permit anything that would jeopardize National Security.
650 2018-11-30 22:53:21 You missing the point, they have access to ports = global markets. If I'm an investor opening a business in Canada I am not going to do it in AB, im going to BC, QC, ON. Alberta doesn't have anything to offer except oil and a lot of snow.
651 2018-11-30 22:53:14 I noted need to study, enhance & mitigate impacts prior to devt, ie. the PURPOSE of assessment. Proven over decades of oil & gas, hydro, logging & other projects. I’m not naming communities. Responsible companies understand & anyone who hopes to make decisions in govt must too
652 2018-11-30 22:53:11 I always wait so long to get my car serviced or to take it for an oil change 
653 2018-11-30 22:53:09 Have to agree with Todd.  Alaska has oil, Puerto Rico does not.

Don you really have no clue how inept you are
654 2018-11-30 22:53:09 Interior Sec'y Zinke chartered a flight on a private plane owned by oil & gas exec. 
Per Washington Post report,the flight from Las Vegas to Kalispell near Zinke's home in Whitefish, Mont. cost taxpayers $12,375

Zinke also used private planes during a trip to the Virgin Islands
655 2018-11-30 22:52:57 Alchohol is not an antimicrobial it just removes the oil from yur skin!
656 2018-11-30 22:52:42 hey did u know mascaras can have soybean oil in them me either until I had an allergic reaction on my EYES
657 2018-11-30 22:52:29 #Oil #OOTT #WTI
#SaudiArabia and #Russia will discuss oil production cut in #G20 meeting during this weekend. What happens in #Argentina won't stay in Argentina! Oil traders shall feel the impact Sunday night.
658 2018-11-30 22:52:24 It’s obvious you don’t understand that there are entire countries that don’t have oil yet manage to create jobs. It’s not really an issue for me; I’m not praying for oil to come back. I do however, hope people who have jobs in AB aren’t caught up in your anti-diversity boycotts.
659 2018-11-30 22:52:21 Can you say something intelligent about the distinction with oil subsidies? Have you considered the policy arguments in favor of subsidies? Can you say anything intelligent about them? Try to write a full article on the subject and educate yourself in the process.
660 2018-11-30 22:52:17 are currently receiving nothing for their oil given the current fire sale price. “Private sector” and “market oriented” does not mean an absence of government regulation, or privatizing the Crown’s resource assets. Unlike 30 years ago, there are no state owned energy companies.
661 2018-11-30 22:52:09 If they cut 10% which would be around 2 MMBD oil goes up 40% so you have to know a cut is coming. Not to mention the brothers from a different mother greeting you posted earlier that tells me they understand the math.
662 2018-11-30 22:51:52 U.S. carmakers collectively have failed yet again to learn from oil shocks and are cavalier about their contribution to climate change, focusing their lineups almost entirely to both trucks and SUVs.
663 2018-11-30 22:51:52 This is true for the major vaccines, but things like the flu shot are complete snake oil. My wife runs statistics for a hospital and the flu shot is trash.
664 2018-11-30 22:51:51 Hey I'm sorry this happened to you, my girlfriend has chronic back pain and uses CBD Salve/Oil to cope with it. She stopped taking muscle relaxers and pain medication because the CBD helped her so much. 90% of pain is caused by inflammation and CBD is a natural anti-inflammatory
665 2018-11-30 22:51:44 Jamaican castor oil is the one!!
666 2018-11-30 22:51:29 The G20...why is that murderer MBS permitted to attend??..Saudi Arabia was trailor trash before they found oil ...AND 19 of the 23 hijackers were Saudi....why haven't we invaded??   Oh...some don't know there was a special jet that whisked Saudis out of America 1 day after 9/11..
667 2018-11-30 22:51:28 Currently plotting revenge.....
I mean. Nobody has done anything yet. I'm just getting prepared for instant retaliation.
Like, you slightly offend me. And bam. I show up at your house and pour oil outside of your shower.... Then sit on the toilet, watch you slip  as I take a crap
668 2018-11-30 22:51:25 Just had my first ever Nuln Oil spill... a rite of passage I believe. No pic because I was trying to stop it getting on the beige carpet. It was lucky that I was wearing black jeans.
#warmongers
669 2018-11-30 22:51:19 true, just trying to say that market based inflation expectations are influenced by things such as oil & don’t necessarily reflect actual inflation data
670 2018-11-30 22:51:18 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
671 2018-11-30 22:51:17 《オリーブ油の豆知識》

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
672 2018-11-30 22:51:14 I don't use that shit either....I use coconut oil 
673 2018-11-30 22:51:08 I drive a Tesla so I use NO oil.
674 2018-11-30 22:51:07 Facts, you shaped like Olive Oil 
675 2018-11-30 22:51:01 Detail this MBS. Is a pig. I would like that pork on the table. We the USA only use 4 % of our oil consumption from all of opac. China usees 50 % of thier imports directly from Saudi Arabia. Its all about China F! MBS.
676 2018-11-30 22:50:52 It’s a massive net gain for society. SpaceX provides services to NASA that NASA could only do with drastically more money because of bureaucracy and EV subsidies are justified because of support for ICE vehicles and oil. They are cleaner and create competition

678 2018-11-30 22:50:24 In Toronto right now "Trumping" is used to identify someone who is exaggerating/overreacting/ or trying to sell snake oil.

There was a Hamilton Police Officer that actually said it on the news.
679 2018-11-30 22:50:16 I think the rail cars purchase is a waste of money. I doubt that @Alberta_UCP have any new ideas. Why not leave the oil in the ground? @OilGasCanada companies could do this by themselves. Why are we tampering with free market? @RachelNotley @jkenney So odd.
680 2018-11-30 22:50:11 You can’t sleep when you have a fam cracking your ribs up like @_J4ME5_ . 

He saw one of my cover letters were i wrote “ My personal goal is to help the Oil and gas industry” 

Baba replied “ Are you God “ . 

So no human can save any sector 
681 2018-11-30 22:50:08 I eat crystallised ginger & sniff peppermint oil, really helps with migraine & headaches. Hope it’s gone by morning x
682 2018-11-30 22:50:06 Oil sands are awash with cocaine and meth. Deal with it, or don't. I don't really care.
683 2018-11-30 22:50:02 Oil?
684 2018-11-30 22:49:56 My favorite part of the Louvre was seeing a framed oil painting of several well-rendered hands and thinking it was a finished composition, only to read the caption which said “Studies of Hands”
685 2018-11-30 22:49:48 Wheat grass, turmeric, ginger, collagen, olive oil, crushed pepper, cayenne pepper, ground flax seed, chia seeds and at one point I even put in powdered bovine colostrum. I may have even put in camel milk. I do research on healthy stuff and experiment.
686 2018-11-30 22:49:46 I need all new shocks and struts cause they old and wearing my tires all wrong, causing the weird noise I've been hearing for about a year. Need 2 new tires and an alignment as well. Plus I took it in for an oil change, tail light replacement, and another maintenance issue.
687 2018-11-30 22:49:41 Ingredients include 1/4 teaspoon of oil
688 2018-11-30 22:49:38 You can hate on me but I never eat fries because way too many calories and possible wheat contamination in frying oil. Kinda miss them but not enough to be sick.
689 2018-11-30 22:49:26 OR WE GET A.... FOOD TRUCK
FUCKIN........ M&MS!!!!! AND MOTOR OIL
690 2018-11-30 22:49:08 Probably trying to get out of a very scary kickback scheme 
Who would say No to  Oil? Royalties? Jobs? Equalization payments? 
With the twit pontificating about what a better “man” he is lol 
How could he possibly support their lack of human rights? 
Their lack of regulations
691 2018-11-30 22:49:06 That is actually bad news for Western Canada. There is not enough rail cars to move oil, let alone record grain AND oil. Both commodities will sit until space frees up. Prices for both will detoriate.
692 2018-11-30 22:49:04 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
693 2018-11-30 22:48:50 So...you’re calling for higher oil prices? I am totally confused as to what you want. If gas were expensive, you’d scream murder about the Liberals. And now that it’s cheaper, it’s bad and the Liberals’ fault?  You guys need to stop taking advice from abandon and Trump.
694 2018-11-30 22:48:46 It’s funny this politician from the pipeline rich North Dakota or was it south $- doesn’t matter well he was on @CBSNews this morning the dude has a total Southside Chicago Stache lol.. funny right . All about the oil .. #Weather #Oil #Heat 
695 2018-11-30 22:48:40 This article smells of untruth. No supporting data or evidence. Biodiesel fuel relies on USED oil. Oil from McDonalds or local Chinese restaurant. Biofuels reuse these destructive oils. Big corps like Quaker, Nestle, J&J, responsible 4 rainforest destruction. They’re wasteful AF.
696 2018-11-30 22:48:39 Granted. So do you continue to pray for oil and gas jobs or do you encourage people to do something else? I choose the latter.
697 2018-11-30 22:48:31 They had to have had the 302. The car was never changed after it came home from the dealer. Not one thing was changed except the oil & tires. 
698 2018-11-30 22:48:27 While I believe there is a need for clean energy I also believe there is a need to get our resources such as oil to the market. Considering we sell most of our oil to the US and a portion to international markets there is still greater need for Canadian oil. IMO. #canpoli
699 2018-11-30 22:48:27 Chili oil is my favorite
700 2018-11-30 22:48:19 snake oil salesman
701 2018-11-30 22:48:13 Doesn’t mix well with baby oil trust me
702 2018-11-30 22:48:12 SMH use the skills buy beard oil make your beard for fit connect Biko. It's the reason you are single and awake at this hour. Must be difficult being you man
703 2018-11-30 22:48:02 Idk who told me it was a good idea to go get a fucking oil change when I feel like shit 
704 2018-11-30 22:48:01 Nah ones like a healthy drink company that is about to release a CBD line ones a cannabis, two are oil companies and one is a tech company that makes microchips but is about to cash in on a lawsuit hopefully in January
705 2018-11-30 22:48:01 No the left will say drilling too much. Removing oil that keeps faults lubricaded.
706 2018-11-30 22:47:59 G20 have you ever seen such a parcel of rogues, liars, buffoons, killers, psychopaths and snake oil salesmen. What a stinking mess of human lowlife.
707 2018-11-30 22:47:53 Coconut oil
708 2018-11-30 22:47:53 Obama says we should thank him for the oil and gas production boom.  Sadly, many believe him and the media won't call him out when he makes such claims.  @NBCNews
709 2018-11-30 22:47:51 Woolwich Gloucester Co: *UpDate Building Fire Paulsboro Road at the Rode's Fireside Restaurant & Tavern *FC reporting an oil pump started smoking *Fire is out *One engine crew is needed for the smoke condition *Fire Task Force 25 has been recalled. BeAlert.
710 2018-11-30 22:47:42 Tea tree oil is my saviour!
711 2018-11-30 22:47:39 Accidentally ripped half my eyelashes w my curler, used coconut oil for 2 weeks and they’re already long as shit yas
712 2018-11-30 22:47:39 To clarify a bit, if I saw a snake oil salesman getting people to buy their stuff, and their victims using that instead of science-based solutions, I’d do my best to show them at they were being lied to, and convince them, through evidence, what the truth was.
713 2018-11-30 22:47:34 When you have The answer to Oil Spills...Amcorco.com and NO ONE IS LISTENING, But you ONLY have ONE WATER MORE Valuable than GOLD or OIL!!
Wait until it's TOO LATE! watch video!
714 2018-11-30 22:47:14  .. Kana sleep ne
715 2018-11-30 22:47:10 That was meant for the idiot who felt the need to make a snarky comment about oil in Alaska, instead of appreciating the fact we need help and the government is stepping in. Truly shows how many jerks are on Twitter
716 2018-11-30 22:47:09 Trump haters are becoming paranoid. This hand shake between two world's biggest oil producers has a symbolic meaning only. Give our @POTUS credit for breaking their dominance in energy production. Trump sees the World affairs today strictly from business perspective. KEEP MAGA.
717 2018-11-30 22:47:07 About half of the Grt Barrier Reef coral is dead.Coral provides habitat for small fish bigger fish feed on. Big fish r part of human food chain Coral’s vital to ocean health yet we keep drilling for oil that will leak & kill ocean wildlife &blasting sea floor destroys whale sonar
718 2018-11-30 22:47:07 Translation: we need your oil revenues. Small though they are.
719 2018-11-30 22:46:55 Me and my girl got Ill on the same day. I took echinacea and black seed oil. She took all the usual crap. My illness never really set in but a week later she’s ill af, so bad she’s had to go to her mums 
720 2018-11-30 22:46:44 さくおはよー！ずっとおふとぅんでぬくぬくしていたい！｡ﾟ(ﾟ´ｪ`ﾟ)ﾟ｡
721 2018-11-30 22:46:43 The problem here, is that this is a manufactured crisis, not a real one. Not sure who's driving this narrative, but the doom they're spouting isn't actually happening, and WCS oil prices aren't what the majority of energy companies are getting for their product after upgrading it
722 2018-11-30 22:46:27 Finally got my butters and oil today! So excited to #whip up my own #natural #body #butter this weekend 
723 2018-11-30 22:46:23 I have some right here . . . . 

Oh wait, this is olive oil.

It's extra virgin though
724 2018-11-30 22:46:23 The only oil boom he participated in was the lube he used on our nation.
725 2018-11-30 22:45:58 Don't worry his incredible science team has already concluded that homosexuality and witchcraft is the cause of the disaster and it has nothing to do with our world being destroyed by oil executives
726 2018-11-30 22:45:46 so the oil smells like farm and makes you break out? amazing
727 2018-11-30 22:45:43 ネットで作るの難しいです…！浮上するたびに突進して絡みに行きますねぇえ！(*´ｪ`*)
728 2018-11-30 22:45:37 Pakistan lost 75,000 casualities in last 17 yrs.

I m feeling shame that we are using the oil of war killers. Praying for democracy in Saudia
729 2018-11-30 22:45:35 *looks at list for 2 seconds*

Gosh, it seems every state listed is involved heavily in oil production.
730 2018-11-30 22:45:29 You mean the Obama that’s taking credit for our economy and the oil boom? Next week he’ll take credit for moving the America embassy to Jerusalem !

733 2018-11-30 22:45:18 Try ginger & peppermint oil x
734 2018-11-30 22:45:17 I'm sorry, what are you trying to say? I don't get why an oil company would endorse people consuming LESS, so i am clearly missing something here
735 2018-11-30 22:45:12 UK takes Lybia for her (in Rome they discovered geological maps with the
oil reserves discovered in 1938), they returned Ethiopia to Hailè Selassiè and gave Dodecanese to Greece and Istria tu Yugoslavia (they had promised it to Yugoslavia in 1940 if it attacked us).
736 2018-11-30 22:45:08 Wats a good beard balm/oil?
737 2018-11-30 22:45:08 Him being socially liberal on a few issues does not give him any slack in my mind. Though I agree with him on gay marriage and probably most of his "liberal points" I still see him as a cult leader and a snake oil salesman.
738 2018-11-30 22:45:07 Exactly and the chances of that happening is high, because you have to assume the owner is up to date with maintenance i.e. tune ups, oil change, new tires (wrong decision when buying used ones).
739 2018-11-30 22:45:04 I know one who sneers at the notion that we might one day run out of oil.  He insists it’s self-renewing, and everyone should have a well in their yard.  He says the govt is lying.  “Fossil fuel??? Think about it...oil from fossils????”  PS He drives for UPS! Be very afraid,
740 2018-11-30 22:44:59 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
741 2018-11-30 22:44:59 Depends. Pasta stuff yes. Rotisserie chicken? Never. Steak? Never. Pork loin? Sauté with olive oil and put into Cuban sandwich? Yes.
742 2018-11-30 22:44:58 今月分の休み全部取ったと思うしかない
743 2018-11-30 22:44:52 You seriously not comparing provinces that have port accesses to a land locked province with a harsh climate with very little to offer to investors other than oil. It is obvious you don't understand the dire situation that AB is in currently without access to global markets.
744 2018-11-30 22:44:50 Ultimately this will retrace, it just depends on when.  For the record in 2008, NG went vertical as old crashed, so that massive divergence is repeating once again;  if enough funds went long oil short NG this squeeze could continue but so far looks like  oil is bottoming
745 2018-11-30 22:44:33 Will he drive to Erie?  I have coconut oil here.
746 2018-11-30 22:44:30 "The phoniest and nastiest things in the world cannot be ingested or even ingested - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
747 2018-11-30 22:44:27 Expand refining capacity in Sarnia. Build pipeline capacity from Alberta to Ontario. All of Ontario should be consuming 100% Canadian oil. Get er done!!!!!
748 2018-11-30 22:44:17 Terrible earthquake in Alaska today. Very bad. And a great many people died. More than I can count with two hands. But it was preventable. So very. It didn’t need to happen. Too much oil underground applying pressure. Drilling = no earthquakes #AlternativeFacts #AlaskaEarthquake
749 2018-11-30 22:44:16 @BKBrianKelly Hey BK....what were u thinking about OIL into the OPEC meeting next week?
750 2018-11-30 22:44:07 If I dey oil rig or offshore I go tell my boss say excuse me sir, I need to go watch my wife put to birth.
Yes, because she needs to know I cherish her. 

Weda na love and cherish go pay the hospital bill for me una go tell me.
751 2018-11-30 22:44:00 葵ちゃんおはようー！(*´ｪ`*)
752 2018-11-30 22:43:56 No, but you are like the poster-kid for projection.  As much as you think this is all conservative v. liberal, it's a criminal/oil/banking/nationalist/fascist war against Western democracies.  Your POTUS is owned by Russian/Saudi interests.  Guessing you heard it here first.
753 2018-11-30 22:43:35 My bf put wheels & tires on my truck & changed the oil!! Blessed w the best 
754 2018-11-30 22:43:34 The Oil Line was shut down, I was like "OHHHH.. that's why he is so super supportive ( plus he is dying for distractions )
755 2018-11-30 22:43:12 Good.  They make zero and do nothing but steal.  Let’s just flood Europe with our oil and they will done inside a decade.  Not one shot fired.

757 2018-11-30 22:43:08 We’re selling sandy tar, they’re selling quality oil. We might drop the differential by $5 of the $50 selling to other markets
758 2018-11-30 22:43:00 Just finished reading SUPERFUEL James and just wanted to say I learned more about the importance of omega 6 / 3 ratio than expected. I have already cast aside the rubbish advice to stop taking an omega 3 fish oil supplement and amended my diet accordingly! Thanks buddy! 
759 2018-11-30 22:43:00 Alternative energy is important, forcing alternative energy & shutting down the Oil & Gas like Lush wants will kill so many towns so quickly, come drive up to northern Alberta and take a look at the scattered empty buildings, houses for sale & shrinking populations as proof.
760 2018-11-30 22:42:53 12 years ago is what I understand?? That means 2006.   Right around the time oil revs kicked in good.
761 2018-11-30 22:42:39 You're forgetting about ammo, fast travel, camp and stable upkeep and useful gadgets like binoculars, gun oil and fishing gear.

763 2018-11-30 22:42:27 Over supply of oil sends prices down 20% in November. WTI oil hit $77/barrel on October 3, currently trading at $51.
764 2018-11-30 22:42:26 I think they use sunflower oil while cooking. :)
765 2018-11-30 22:42:23 Drilling for oil? Fracking?
I expect it can only get worse.
766 2018-11-30 22:42:10 $CRR I believe Wilk Brothers are short because of 

1. insider information
2. US fracing industry information (US Fracing industry are hedged hugely and likes lower oil prices) = i could bet the OPEC is doing nothing
3. They protected + overpaid this incompetent CEO Gary Kolstad
767 2018-11-30 22:41:55 This crisis is self inflicted, and only concerns 20% of current oil production. Everyone's losing their minds, when it has been occurring for literally decades.
768 2018-11-30 22:41:55 The #SantaDog has been delivering delicious loads to feed us all this Christmas, from fructose for candy to sunflower oil for mashed potato blends.

771 2018-11-30 22:41:43 For years they were fried in beef fat. The beef flavor was added when they went to a “healthier “ frying oil.
772 2018-11-30 22:41:36  so that's where to motor oil thing came from

774 2018-11-30 22:41:10 Drill 1900 holes in the ground, take a large amount of mass out of the earth, then refill all that mass(dirt,stone and oil), and replace it with waste water, now do this for years. Is the ground more or less stable after this process? Yes I'm sending this same reply to everyone.
775 2018-11-30 22:41:05 Trudeau wouldn't know what happens in a real rural community. He has no idea. They want the workers to come. Little towns are hurting with no oil activity. Empty motels. Empty diners. No work at the welders, nothing happening. It hits a lot of jobs in those places.
776 2018-11-30 22:41:00 Drill 1900 holes in the ground, take a large amount of mass out of the earth, then refill all that mass(dirt,stone and oil), and replace it with waste water, now do this for years.

777 2018-11-30 22:40:56 Why are they not equal? Animals have not caused plastic pollution. Animals have not caused the melting of the ice caps. Animals have not invaded the habitat of the Orangutan to plant palm oil trees. Animals are not the reason so many beautiful animals are endangered.
778 2018-11-30 22:40:48 *Does he put olive oil in the water
*thats a good way
779 2018-11-30 22:40:39 he has stove top he already heated up ( oil or wood, don't know) he is outdoorsy so he has plenty of supplies to get him through ^^. the roads around his neighborhood are closed for now, TBD when opened again. and the house has some structural damage, but standing
780 2018-11-30 22:40:37 oh nice! more reason for me to try it out and convince my parents then. what oil in particular?

785 2018-11-30 22:40:21 Anyone got some cat oil for me? My cat is squeaking when purring. It's like snake oil but for cats.
786 2018-11-30 22:40:11 Yes an ancient Romans knew it. Food was subsidized & given for free to the poor (over 1/4 of govt revenues) as a way to keep ppl happy & quell insurrection. Ppl that didn’t have to spend so much on basics had more to buy wine/oil from the landed elite, which kept them happy too.
787 2018-11-30 22:40:11 Do you think this might be because the government are being paid by the oil companies?? And that is why they haven’t totally invested in green fuel??? It’s another Tory stitch up! X

791 2018-11-30 22:40:01 Man I lost my debit card and my car needs gas so I thought my dad had has in a red thingy and it turns out to be oil and I put it in my car 
792 2018-11-30 22:39:41 Found out yesterday that you don’t need to put oil in pasta water and if you do the sauce just slides off the noodles....my life is a lie
793 2018-11-30 22:39:39 If it is not why oil prices are high, but opec is increasing output rates literally right now.
794 2018-11-30 22:39:34 Actual nobody wants or needs our oil. That’s the problem
795 2018-11-30 22:39:30 Oil heaters , fuck that.  It’s all Asic from here.  !
796 2018-11-30 22:39:24 There are thousands of leaks in the undersea pipeline. The cost would be astronomical to repair and the oil companies don't care about people. Do you think they would care about our seafood?
797 2018-11-30 22:39:12 My mom bought me so many vitamins and a bottle of peppermint essential oil  Now I’m sitting her wondering if she was just being nice or if this is my Christmas gift?

801 2018-11-30 22:38:26 I'm so sad I can't eat digestives anymore a) because of my infected tooth and more importantly  b) because they contain palm oil
802 2018-11-30 22:38:24 My mom uses oil instead of ghee. It's common in Hyderabad
803 2018-11-30 22:38:22 In college we had a “deep fry everything event”. 1st hr: food. 2nd hr: truly anything till the oil got cold. Somebody deep fried a calc textbook.
804 2018-11-30 22:38:20 What's REALLY interesting is that 80% of the oil companies aren't even impacted by trade price of oil, because they upgrade, then ship.  So I really have to wonder, how much the 20% that didn't plan are handing out to get Kenney to bang on this drum.
805 2018-11-30 22:38:16 Oil, making aid a priority to states since 2017.

808 2018-11-30 22:38:06 Surely you can find someone to blame for this tragedy! Perhaps it was an oil gusher run dry? Deep well injections? Coal mining? If not raking the forest causes forest fires, surely you can find a human cause for earthquakes! Or is it because you support the above activities?
809 2018-11-30 22:38:04 Fuck @BarackObama, Increased oil production, massive increase to the drone program, bailed out the banks instead of paying the mortgages(cheaper, money in the hands of the people, less homelessness) and fuck him for not breaking up the banks to prevent it from happening again.2/2
810 2018-11-30 22:37:56 I’m just talkin shit lol It coulda been a cousin, friend, etc. Point is, I know why yo oil change is $150 lol

It can be harvested after scrubbing from oil or produce from cells separating hydrogen from water. just imagine a power cell giving elec. heat. & power your car all for one household

813 2018-11-30 22:37:45 Some western oil companies require seismic activities to halt if a whale is seen by a dedicated observer. Unfortunately, seismic gun sound energy travels a very great distance...

814 2018-11-30 22:37:37 I do not believe your oil plant be High Technology Real Cold Pressing !

Which oil Presses you use..?
815 2018-11-30 22:37:34 That's money he invested to make the US the #1 I oil producing nation.
816 2018-11-30 22:37:22 Here's hoping oil prices tank!
817 2018-11-30 22:37:13 If you got out of your bubble, you'd know this is true. Not in every case, just in most.  Ever stay in the single motel in some little Northern town (any province) where male workers on construction projects or oil fields are housed? Give it a try and then tell us all about it.
818 2018-11-30 22:37:06 I can still smell the smoke from the oil drum they put outside for the plebs like us to huddle round
819 2018-11-30 22:37:02 its more likely that $50 dollar oil will kill the shale industry
820 2018-11-30 22:37:01 Looks Gd Jah! I love fried Mushrooms  w olive oil and  Tomatoes. Delicious.. U live longer when u eat right 
821 2018-11-30 22:36:58 They're furious at themselves for not having diversified their economy enough away from boom and bust oil and that oil is in another bust phase?
822 2018-11-30 22:36:56 Yeh??...all that oil that will stay in the ground...it's whisky dreams mate.... get your begging bowl labelled in French, you'll need it.
823 2018-11-30 22:36:52 My mom just said “every relationship needs maintenance. you don’t leave your car on the side of the road because it needs an oil change. you change the oil. Same thing with a relationship, you maintain it so that it doesn’t breakdown on you”
824 2018-11-30 22:36:26 自动变速箱油和丙酮一比一混合，倒进oilier里面，市面上除了liquid wrench以外别的penetrating oil基本不是对手，价格大概是你这瓶的1/10
825 2018-11-30 22:36:25 StupidFriday?'s One at a time, CAH-mull, Sub shop but hold the oil, salt and pepper, and mayo.

832 2018-11-30 22:35:39 Keep on drilling for oil and soon this will be the norm...
833 2018-11-30 22:35:33 It’s all for the oil baby. I get my skin too dry I know I’m about to get battered. Too bad there’s no drilling in Israel I don’t know who these morons think they are dealing with but they do not have twitter or read evidently.
834 2018-11-30 22:35:18 What did Putin stand to gain? Repealing the Magnitski Act, buying more oil from Russia, and looking the other way when Putin sabotages/attacks various western democracies. You know, what is in the works right now.
835 2018-11-30 22:35:15 What is the difference between Alaska and Puerto Rico?  Ahhh. PR does not have Oil!!!
836 2018-11-30 22:34:50 Lol     I guess you should try Holy oil sir?
837 2018-11-30 22:34:49 What is your idea on diversification? What industry should we lobby for that can create hundreds thousands of jobs? Do you own a business and employ people? Well I do! After I left oil industry I opened my own company but I want a strong oil industry - it's beneficial for all.
838 2018-11-30 22:34:38 There's tons of jobs in renewable energy...they're just not Big Oil revenue producing jobs.
839 2018-11-30 22:34:38 It seems in Fortress Rugby the drawbridge is up, boiling oil next !
840 2018-11-30 22:34:33 Same.  I have done similar with some gooey printing ink & oil paint but it's soooo frigging messy. That oil stick looks quite a nice quick clean method.
841 2018-11-30 22:34:25 Conors left, his main striking coach has left, snake oil salesman  Kavanagh being exposed.
Not worthy of being Supreme Court Judge either.

843 2018-11-30 22:34:14 Need a oil change, stuff on 10%
844 2018-11-30 22:34:05 Google Translate:* 'we need your oil, tax revenues, Tory MPs, Coastline, sea, grouse moors, Balmoral, nuclear base, military strategically significant location, etc, etc oh and soon we'll need all your water as we'll have none.'
845 2018-11-30 22:33:56 Adulthood is getting your oil changed and car washed and feeling like you’re treating yourself
846 2018-11-30 22:33:43 next week , oil goes up  ? 
847 2018-11-30 22:33:42 Oil of boil.
848 2018-11-30 22:33:35 Many Americans will cheer your efforts to stabilize oil prices. Despite what a lot of people think, many Americans like me depend on the energy industry for a living and we need higher prices to make a decent living. Good luck this week
849 2018-11-30 22:33:34 Oil up a plastic straw and see if you can slip it in where the spout is? Should break the pressure block.
850 2018-11-30 22:33:31 @thirsty_always That olive oil is good! Cc @TheGazzz
851 2018-11-30 22:33:31 Nude up Charles, cover your self in baby oil, put your good gumboots on and go and hug your neighbour the man from Dairy Australia says it's the answer

853 2018-11-30 22:33:29 Oh, so you think you made the global oil price to go down?!

855 2018-11-30 22:32:39 NO ONE GLOBALLY will put Canada's name first except silly childish Canadians who think Justin's destroying the oil sands and carbon tax will not collapse the Canadian economy - will hit Dec 2019 - it will be catastrophic
856 2018-11-30 22:32:39 Oil much?
857 2018-11-30 22:32:33 I did it close to a year and a half, similar to my (misguided) veganism in 2012/13. I quit and now just follow Orthodox tenets including fasts, so this time of the year, I'm basically vegan but w/o oil and wine:))
858 2018-11-30 22:32:32 TIL about the relationship between argan oil and goats. I'll never look at shampoo the same way ever again!
859 2018-11-30 22:32:31 This chick waiting for her car’s oil to get changed is complaining about a 20 minute promised time with a full shop. If she wants it done quicker, why doesn’t she do it herself? 
860 2018-11-30 22:32:27 Tea Tree Oil helps with frog abscess. Add to the soak.
861 2018-11-30 22:32:25 Even if true ( not saying it is or isn’t ) where is your personal threshold for polluting this planet for profits in the oil and coal game?  I’d really like to know?  Is it a ppm? or number of clean water ways? Or are we good to go till we figure a solution?
862 2018-11-30 22:32:21 I wanted to share a story about the Obama oil thing but only outlets that wrote about it were right wing.
863 2018-11-30 22:31:55 This carnival snake oil salesman is acting Attorney General!!
864 2018-11-30 22:31:53 Shoutout to my new friend - the very persistent bot that really wants to reserve books on cpd oil
865 2018-11-30 22:31:46 Just remembered I gotta get an oil change from Hank Hill talking about how he changes his oil every 3000 miles. Thanks King 
866 2018-11-30 22:31:41 Pastries and fruits are are also shipped in from other places around world because they produce nothing but oil here...animals and plants have a hard time living here!
867 2018-11-30 22:31:33 Time to replenish. I must drink loads of water and eat my veggies and meals with little oil. Cause damn, I never want this to happen again.
868 2018-11-30 22:31:32 Serious & Fokotsa the oil
869 2018-11-30 22:31:13 So the ongoing mantra of Suzuki&Trudeau is that the poor unenlightened "locals" don't understand the difficulties S&T face in climate change or, transporting Alberta's oil to tidewater. Two obvious argumentum ad hominem attacks from two of the bitterest bias bastards in Canada.
870 2018-11-30 22:30:57 A brand new bottle of olive oil broke right in front of my door and I believe that’s an accurate depiction of life atm
871 2018-11-30 22:30:56 Can’t wait to go get this cannabis oil ....

874 2018-11-30 22:30:46 Stir together 9 tsps daily bread with 1 pound enchilada. Mix into  Olive Oil. Roast. Serve with salmon
875 2018-11-30 22:30:23 If after all this winning oil is at $20, just imagine how bad it would be if she lost.
876 2018-11-30 22:30:22 Drill 1900 holes in the ground, take a large amount of mass out of the earth, then refill all that mass(dirt,stone and oil), and replace it with waste water, now do this for years. Is the ground more or less stable after this process? 1/2 tweet to be continued.
877 2018-11-30 22:30:22 Oil have had a pretty weak schedule since the coaching change (especially compared with the murderer’s row they had to contend with the first 6 weeks), I have to think that influences these numbers.
878 2018-11-30 22:30:17 technically, yes. ethically- no because the production of cocaine is responsible for a lot of deforestation. so it’s kinda like palm oil.
879 2018-11-30 22:30:14 Most of our friends in fact left Canada to work overseas with no plans to come back. Contributing to another  country economy growth. Oil industry creates thousands of jobs so that's why Albertans are so adamant about building pipelines.
880 2018-11-30 22:30:13 Global Warming. Oil is an incredible insulator. I wonder if any scientist has considered if oil’s removal from below the surface is in fact what is creating global warming given temperatures below the surface are much higher than above it. We are removing our thermal blanket.
881 2018-11-30 22:29:58 In some of African countries hydropower is considered as conventional power like oil, gas or coal in another countries. Though nearly 100% power source of Ethiopia is from renewable.
882 2018-11-30 22:29:55 Could be worse.  Saw some stories about cooking oil used in booties...
883 2018-11-30 22:29:52 Oil change needed..smh

885 2018-11-30 22:29:31 Anyone else feel like the most accomplished adult ever when you get an oil change ?
886 2018-11-30 22:29:29 Fake news.  Just admit you have no idea how seismic exploration works.  They weren't given permission to harass whales, they are exploring for oil, the companies have to have whale watchers on board the boats, and shut down for mammals.
887 2018-11-30 22:29:25 Has anyone come up with a begging bowl emoji yet? Please sir, buy our weapons and sell us your oil. Oh, teeny bit bothered by your brutal govt.
888 2018-11-30 22:29:14 You got many pipelines approved sending out oil sands oil to the USA. And none to the world.
You would he better positioned to do this back in the federal government.
889 2018-11-30 22:29:14 Did They Ride bikes or tricycles today? Can they get shit done without driving cars, using machines to build green shit- without oil? Do they know that their make up is oil based and clothes on backs made possible by fossil fuels? Shit for Brains Ocasio is her Name!
890 2018-11-30 22:29:05 Trans Alaska pipeline down as a precaution. No apparent impact on oil prices. Now responsible for only about 4 percent of national output, but still an economic lifeline for Alaska.
891 2018-11-30 22:29:04 I also love the grandstanding of donating to global warming awareness when so many of their products they sell are made out materials that come from crude oil.
892 2018-11-30 22:28:51 No America is loosing money on its oil production the smiling devil lies
893 2018-11-30 22:28:49 Ya Obama, the guy who killed Keystone XL, says he built the US oil industry.
894 2018-11-30 22:28:48 A) No one is saying we should leave oil jobs to work at LUSH. Stop it. People are saying we should create new jobs in other energy sectors & that AB should diversify.
B) Not everyone works in oil. I don't and *gasp* I can still afford their overpriced delicious smelling products,
895 2018-11-30 22:28:48 I Guess Day Dreaming is Free & Effective with Honey & Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
896 2018-11-30 22:28:39 100% Scott Morrison was kissing MBS's shoes  off camera. The French President was recorded having a put-on 'stern' convo with MBS. Let's be honest - they all pander to the dollar and to the oil.
897 2018-11-30 22:28:34 Good to see my 2 straight days of anxiety had culminated in me elbowing my popcorn maker to the floor, breaking it and dumping oil and popcorn kernels all over my floor.
898 2018-11-30 22:28:22 Guuurrrrlllll - If you bake with boxed cake mixes ever (I'm old and don't have time for "from scratch" anymore lol) replace the oil and eggs in your cake batter with a can of pumpkin.  You'll never go back - I SWEAR IT!
899 2018-11-30 22:28:19 Serderidis can do whatever he want ( huge sponsor follow him -Kroon Oil). Wilson with huge smile on face borrow him one of the Fiesta's WRC in 2019

902 2018-11-30 22:28:00 I threw my back out and sorry but Advil and CBD oil are not cutting it. Naturally, no narcotics 4 excruciating acute pain because the only ones who can get those now, are the drug addicts. Thanks for using those meds as a fÜkn toy for recreation instead of a tool 4 recovery
903 2018-11-30 22:27:51 I'm pretty sure that's all oil on your hair queen
904 2018-11-30 22:27:48 Well, the beard could use some oil, but other than that he’s mostly okay. LOL
905 2018-11-30 22:27:39 So should car dealers and oil companies (sounds dumb now eh? ) #ableg
906 2018-11-30 22:27:38 But I'm being honest, if you somehow didn't already know, Bush invaded Iraq for oil, not becuase their were 'weapons of mass destruction', it was for oil, 1 million innocent people died becuase of Bush. And then terrorists groups were created out of no where.
907 2018-11-30 22:27:37 ファミマのカフェオレ泡の上に砂糖乗るし混ざってるのか分からない
908 2018-11-30 22:27:29 It will never run out but the next to the last barrel of oil will become a little expensive
909 2018-11-30 22:27:29 my brother is so funny he has this obsession with creating the perfect fried chicken he doesn't cook at all but he's constantly looking up recipes and once bought all the ingredients and rn he's looking up the science and trying to determine the perfect oil temp to fry in
910 2018-11-30 22:27:12 こっすー...
911 2018-11-30 22:27:11 While it is true that we do currently use fossil fuels to conduct business, we realize that it is an unsustainable practice. We are advocating for a just transition to clean renewable energy, in which gas and oil workers are retained, for a greener future for all Canadians.
912 2018-11-30 22:26:53 I keep getting emails about opportunities in towns where I’ve never lived, for jobs that I’m not qualified for. Oil rig tech in Midland? I’m your gal I guess.
913 2018-11-30 22:26:50 Nationwide new heights is solid. But solid only as it relates to bonds. These insurance salesmen pitching them as alternatives to equities are snake oil salesmen. Regardless of marketing, best products make 5.5%6%.
914 2018-11-30 22:26:46 Fish Oil, although you'd be very popular with cats.
915 2018-11-30 22:26:40 Not on the relevant political scale. Oil industry workers who make $90,000 a year don't vote like tech workers who make $90,000 a year.
916 2018-11-30 22:26:33 OceanBlasting causes whales & dolphins to beach themselves. Not only that, ALL ocean wildlife is stressed from massive oil well leaks, de-salinization from accelerating polar ice cap melt & huge coral die-offs that destroy habitats. PLS DO NOT BLAST & DRILL IN OUR OCEANS!
917 2018-11-30 22:26:31 Told him like “I told you to chill nigga, you’ve got oil, you have no issue”
918 2018-11-30 22:26:30 Flouting most basic tenets of modern civilized institutions- embassies are treated as trustworthy institutions not medieval torture chambers. But if you have oil wells and dirty deals with countries whose citizens depend on it, the rules do not apply to you!
919 2018-11-30 22:26:29 As i recall he was the guy between the bankers and the pitchforks, which ties rather neatly to this new clip about the oil
920 2018-11-30 22:26:23 Is he trying to say more women are needed on the oil patch frontlines
921 2018-11-30 22:26:03 I hate going to get my oil changed because the treat me like I’m a fucking idiot
922 2018-11-30 22:26:03 agreed, but PR doesn't have oil reserves for exploitation.
923 2018-11-30 22:25:51 You can thank yourself Gary (in your own small way) for demonizing Canada’s oil & gas industry, for feeding a left-wing narrative that is divorced from global economic realities, and for helping to create this pathetically stupid circumstance in which Canada is self-destructing.
924 2018-11-30 22:25:41 the US and UK didn't fire at civilians, but Turkey have let ISIS flee its borders for the cheap oil.
925 2018-11-30 22:25:34 You need to look at prop1 and other oil company laws you dumbfucks passed this month.
926 2018-11-30 22:25:32 #ice 20 minutes 3-4 times,and i use THC free cbd oil,seems to help with a lot of things
927 2018-11-30 22:25:32 Drill 1900 holes in the ground, take a large amount of mass out of the earth, then refill all that mass(dirt,stone and oil), and replace it with waste water, now do this for years. Is the ground more or less stable after this process?
928 2018-11-30 22:25:29 As one of oil workers that was laid off in 2014 because the company left Canada to US I can assure you no one is sitting around waiting for oil to come back. But lush will NEVER provide enough jobs or sustainability. AB needs pipelines or there will be no one to shop at Lush
929 2018-11-30 22:25:23 oil, gas, natural resources like gold and silver and diamond and upon a quick google if you still trust google diamond is compressed carbon
930 2018-11-30 22:25:22 USA IS A EMPIRE , UGO CHAVEZ HAVE RIGHT. USA WANT VENECUELAN OIL.

It comes highly recommended so we’ll see if it helps.
942 2018-11-30 22:23:38 Mine’s now down to my bra strap. My tips = minimize how often you use heat/blow dry. I usually keep to once a week, and use macadamia oil to protect it. I only wash 2x a week (dry shampoo is awesome). Try using a deep conditioner/mask once a week.
943 2018-11-30 22:23:37 I never  use olive oil to fry

947 2018-11-30 22:23:05 Because the oil hasn’t run out yet and UK politics is, and always has been hypocritical and morally bankrupt.
948 2018-11-30 22:23:01 They had to change to laws to allow oil exports. And they did. And now we are a petrol state enslaved to arguments that we need to frack to grow. Thanks.
949 2018-11-30 22:22:54 I'm living off of tea, Alka Seltzer,  and breathing into this tissue I soaked in peppermint oil.
950 2018-11-30 22:22:52 I mean a lot of green technologies and funding is tied up in knots due to oil tycoon lobbied government policy

If we took the money that we spend subsidizing oil and paid people to work on r&d and installation of green technologies it would create jobs
951 2018-11-30 22:22:50 When you’re driving and you smell an oil leak and think it’s your car , but it’s the POS Ford in front of you

953 2018-11-30 22:22:34 Bro I’ve been at the dealership for an hour waiting for my car to be finished with it’s oil change. These ladies were here like 25 minutes for an oil change and were out. Like what? Bro. My car. I got shit to do.
954 2018-11-30 22:22:34 Uh huh. Well, as “relevant” as oil and gas is, they aren’t providing jobs. Many of those waiting believe Kenney’s fairy tales that a conservative govt will get their jobs back. You have their votes, sure, but then what?
955 2018-11-30 22:22:32 @MarkAmodeiNV2 @SenDeanHeller @SenCortezMasto: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoasts
#SaveTheWhales
956 2018-11-30 22:22:30 Damb! I knew there was a reason I’m the only one advocating for the demise of oil companies, one at a time.
957 2018-11-30 22:22:16 So @JimOberhofer is apparently off the crew chief market after announcing he’s opening a chain of oil change centers near Dallas. Congrats on a dream realized. #NHRA
958 2018-11-30 22:22:12 Saudi Arabia Priorities national dvpt Zim ministers are corrupt; no1 s jailed..they have oil Zim got nothing .
Thats why saudi arabia had to get a deal.!
959 2018-11-30 22:22:10 @realDonaldTrump suggest rather work to dump Saudi oil and buy cheaper Canadian oil instead for humanitarian & no democratic reasons> sell your weapon s to India Austrslia Japan.U hvToCurtail Islamic nations defense supplies.Change NATO to SNATO  take India Israel Australia Japan
960 2018-11-30 22:22:05 Drain the top with a splash of hot oil.
961 2018-11-30 22:21:57 Texas oil payed the Saints to lay some eggs #conspiracy
962 2018-11-30 22:21:46 Went and got my oil changed. Had to wait in the “lounge” and hear Dr. Oz talk about cottage cheese stuff in a woman’s vagina. Gonna change my own oil next time!
963 2018-11-30 22:21:44 いやいや、そのためのふるさと納税でしょ！
ふるさと納税を行政指導で締めつけておいて、なに言ってんの？
964 2018-11-30 22:21:43 At least one leader had the boldness...But Trump traded khashoggi death against oil price so that Saudi Arabia shall drop the price in order to have US support...too bad.
965 2018-11-30 22:21:31 Did you see Oil City Confidential By Julien Temple?
966 2018-11-30 22:21:16 What would be your plan?

Should we shut down oil fields and coal mines?

How would that effect the price of gas/electric and what would these people do?
967 2018-11-30 22:21:14 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
968 2018-11-30 22:21:13 Anyone who fries sausages and eggs in olive oil needs stringing up imo 
969 2018-11-30 22:21:09 He's an authority on corruption and technocracy. Also illegal wars for oil. You can trust him to push for these things.
970 2018-11-30 22:21:07 I just paid 140 for an Oil change 
971 2018-11-30 22:21:05 Feminism and online activism is like -

Grabbing a "fish oil'' can to post an instagram pic with #stayfit #Omega3 #stayhealthy #eathealthy while getting notification from a twitter post with hastags

This is so sad! #savewhales #saveenvironment #savethesea
972 2018-11-30 22:21:01 Sorry. Forgot a drizzle of olive oil.
973 2018-11-30 22:20:53 Hit with an $800 oil bill today... Bad time of year for that, but we were running low. Gahhh. 
974 2018-11-30 22:20:44 I sometimes think if it was possible through chemical processes to make plastic out of oil, could it be possible to reverse them ( or at least render it biodegradable through other chemical processes, and put it back where it came from?
975 2018-11-30 22:20:35 lmao next time pls take the pepper and palm oil mummy said you should take
976 2018-11-30 22:20:25 Wind energy has been subsidized by gov.(s) to make it competitive with coal fired power stations & nuclear PS's don't include decommissioning in their cost structure. Obama left tax payers with a $2.2 Billion debt on Solar Energy.  We now make money on oil exports.  @FoxNews
977 2018-11-30 22:20:25 The maker of Cadbury chocolate bars, Oreo biscuits and Ritz crackers is accused of destroying tens of thousands of hectares of orangutan habitat in just two years for palm oil.
978 2018-11-30 22:20:19 They just don’t have as many job openings. Because they don’t need the staff. You know there are people sitting and waiting for oil to “come back”; some have been unemployed since 2014. Sure they aren’t working at Lush but some ABns are they probably want to keep it that way.
979 2018-11-30 22:20:19 Gotta get me some cbd oil or sumn
980 2018-11-30 22:20:10 Riddle me this, @thelaurenloftus:

There is a FOG advisory in western KANSAS. Please tell me why there is so much oil under Saudi Arabia??
981 2018-11-30 22:20:08 Was anybody expecting us to stop producing fossil fuels =while= we are still consuming so much of it?
What am I missing here?
Isn’t regulation/reduced consumption goals what actually works?

Was y’all expecting oil barons 2just leave those deposits underground? What am I missing?
982 2018-11-30 22:19:48 Or you could just be a Celiac. Only fast food chain with gluten free tenders and fries cooked in oil separate from their wheat products. 
983 2018-11-30 22:19:42 Tuscan leather and Creed aventus perfume oil together, I smell like Money 
984 2018-11-30 22:19:39 THAT OIL, BOY
985 2018-11-30 22:19:35 Ate and kuya's out of town for swimming sana oil
986 2018-11-30 22:19:29 The mwc bowl tie-ins are awful. BYU ain't in much better of a situation either, though. The path to a NY6 bowl is easier in mwc than Indy. The ESPN deal is the ace for BYU this year. No ESPN deal, they would be celebrating Christmas in Utah county basking in doTerra lavender oil.
987 2018-11-30 22:19:29 No I don't. I have a mesh pan that sits ontop of a cookie sheet. It's supposed to be like an air fryer but for your oven. Before you spend money on a fryer I would buy an air fryer. No oil, no mess, tons less calories.  I've had a fryer and the oil gets stinky and messy.
988 2018-11-30 22:19:26 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.
989 2018-11-30 22:19:20 How are you shorting oil?

1000 2018-11-30 22:18:12 Absolutely excellent information! Aldi brands stand out bigtime. But many others are going sustainable palm oil. Thanks!
1001 2018-11-30 22:18:10 Being an employee in an oil refinery, from inspection to confined space gas testing there’s a growing need for drones in the work place. Drone USA is going to grow by leaps and bounds.
1002 2018-11-30 22:18:02 Jus spilled all my coconut oil down da drain  da fuck
1003 2018-11-30 22:18:00 How about regions like Oklahoma where hydraulic fracturing, "fracking" for exploiting oil, has created human made highly active earthquake zones. Can oil exploiting activity link these fault zones together?
1004 2018-11-30 22:17:48 Glad you're all ok.

1. Did anyone else notice the male security officer ducked under the table & the female officer just sauntered away?

2. Has anyone checked oil pipelines for leakage?

1009 2018-11-30 22:17:15 I opted to get one next time. As for my oil change, it was my last freebie from when I bought this sucker. After all, God gave me one for free.
1010 2018-11-30 22:17:10 Funny isn't it that with all the Foreign Money flowing in to attack our energy sector, non of these so called standards and initiatives have been applied to foreign oil coming in. It's almost as if it's being paid for..... Funny that....
1011 2018-11-30 22:17:07 Nope, just amusing that you imply I am somehow related to the oil industry (or in their thrall) while omitting the minor feature that you are literally a paid activist on this file. 

Note: I have no conflicts of interest on this file and my blogging is done off the company dime.

1016 2018-11-30 22:16:50 Deep fried in oil and sprinkled in tons of salt. No matter how healthy the ingredient was at the start, it will go to shit when you dip it in oil.
1017 2018-11-30 22:16:50 I’m not disagreeing that there will always be some price differential, but that results from not being able to get our product to market not strictly on quality. Are there some environmental risks to pipelines, yes, but way less than running our oil by rail.
1018 2018-11-30 22:16:40 pre birthday festivities: dad took me to get an oil change & some lunch!!!! now on to the best part - getting ready for work 
1019 2018-11-30 22:16:31 로또당첨 후기 같은거 보고싶다
1020 2018-11-30 22:16:25 ドラというよりトラっぽい
1021 2018-11-30 22:16:23 (And if we choose 01/01/1985 as the date for the commencement of oil shipping from the oil sands, the corresponding numbers are 6,787 days of Conservative-led federal govt. and 5,599 days of Liberal-led federal govt.)
1022 2018-11-30 22:16:16 I love the @MercedesBenz  tv ad offering 2 years free servicing. It only needs 1 service every 2 years after the initial oil change. So shouldn’t they simply say ‘1 free service’ instead?
1023 2018-11-30 22:16:12 How long does an oil change take?
1024 2018-11-30 22:15:47 88% of soya that animals eat is soya meal which is the by product of soya bean oil. Soya bean oil is used almost exclusively by humans if we didn’t have animal agriculture we would still grow as much and have huge amounts of inedible waste
1025 2018-11-30 22:15:45 I got an oil change without any dumb man telling me to. Men are officially useless NEXT
1026 2018-11-30 22:15:43 Returned from Myrtle Beach, SC recently. The oil rigs are the ugliest sight I have ever seen. To hell with the tourism and the local economy says the idiot.. It breaks my heart.

That's how Carpio's stand on the joint oil/gas explorations swivelled in just a few, short "hope i become CJ" days. Pathetic.
1032 2018-11-30 22:15:08 pumpkin seed oil/serum. thank me later.
1033 2018-11-30 22:15:04 Hopefully we will soon get the way over due, free energy that has been held back from us, because, the poor oil & gas barons might lose their graft & corruption funds.
1034 2018-11-30 22:14:59 Second this^^^  @_natasha_love !!! Also I sometimes use coconut oil! I’ve been to the dermatologist a thousand times and they always recommended @CetaphilCol or @cerave I do an occasional face mask, LUSH handmade cosmetics has the best face masks!
1035 2018-11-30 22:14:50 If there wasn't any oil, there would probably be 0 anti-Israel resolutions.
1036 2018-11-30 22:14:47 Best Cash on Delivery heating oil service for Allston?
1037 2018-11-30 22:14:41 'Hi Mo, during our weekly meeting, Her Maj said our best bet is to act cold and stand-offish for the cameras because of the Jamal Khashoggi thing, but don't worry, BAE deal is still going ahead; we'll keep the oil for arms going so we can route money offshore for you know what'
1038 2018-11-30 22:14:33 Haha! I know! I couldn't believe it. And oil on pancakes! Outrageous!
1039 2018-11-30 22:14:32 Trump is OK with killing whales and dolphins as long as oil and gas companies can make a buck in the ocean ...
1040 2018-11-30 22:14:18 :) I'm sure the fact that this particular baked good was made from a packaged mix that was years past the best-by date probably didn't help. I've never had the chance to try polenta olive oil cakes, but they do sound tasty.

1042 2018-11-30 22:14:00 Because most are fried in soybean oil.
1043 2018-11-30 22:13:54 I tried that too, but it doesn’t work for me. You could have roasted me over a fire with the amount of oil I slapped on, but still my skin dries up in no time  Also I can’t use oil in daytime during summer, or I’ll actually roast, I’m pale af 
1044 2018-11-30 22:13:52 My brother called me like you left your mint oil  lipgloss at the house . Lmao what a gent  and i thought i lost it

1048 2018-11-30 22:13:37 Awaam is not happy with 2 rupees downward revision in price when the barrel price of oil has fallen substantially.

1059 2018-11-30 22:12:38 Why why why is there palm oil in literally everything?? 
1060 2018-11-30 22:12:37 Has anyone told them everything they like is made with oil & coal, like technology items, will they give up their mobile phones for climate change
1061 2018-11-30 22:12:36 Why do you want to encourage fossil fuel usage? Why do you want to continue causing horrendous air pollution that kills 29000 per year? What motivates you? Are you paid by an oil company?

1064 2018-11-30 22:12:08 Hey maybe they should control their state better. You know no more dancing, jumping or jogging. These activities lead to earth movement. Not things like oil drilling or fracking.
1065 2018-11-30 22:12:07 Such wells no longer produce oil and gas, but they have not been plugged. Thousands more have been abandoned, meaning they have been sealed but the surrounding land has not yet been restored to its predrilling state.
1066 2018-11-30 22:12:00 How many new malls have been built anywhere in #Barqah?  Yes same old cry - how many have read how #Benghazi lays still in ruins?  Where do the funds come from to build malls in #Zliten?  Barqah oil fields?
1067 2018-11-30 22:11:55 I had the worst headache today. It took some Aleve, essential oil, leaving work early, prayer, and two hours of sleep in the dark to get rid of. But I’m much better now.
1068 2018-11-30 22:11:50 US oil production cost is lower than in Saudi Arabia due to new robotics drilling technologies and they can survive $30 a barrel. Highly expensive drilling human workers have been fired already and unemployed.
1069 2018-11-30 22:11:40 I’ve been putting vitamin e oil on my face mixed with moisturizer and it’s the best decision I’ve made this week
1070 2018-11-30 22:11:25 Weeks’ closing remarks: string reversal in equities esp. tech. Upside risk remains. Oil - indecisive. Crypto - indecisive.
1071 2018-11-30 22:11:21 I got CBD oil and L-Theanine. That should tide me over. 
1072 2018-11-30 22:11:20 Imperial Oil began shipping oil from the oil sands in 1985. For the sake of argument - I don't have the exact date - let's say June 15 1985. Since 15/06/1985, there have been Conservative PMs for 6,622 days, and Liberal PMs for 5,599 days. Yet the Libs have failed Alberta?
1073 2018-11-30 22:11:19 The move follows a similar commitment from Alberta. A Globe investigation showed about 20 per cent of all oil and gas wells in B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan are inactive, and that there are 54,147 more idle wells in those three provinces than there were in 2005.
1074 2018-11-30 22:11:16 It’s dangerous but interesting how oil reacts.

1083 2018-11-30 22:10:45 Slightly more than half of BC residents support the twinning project. Which means almost half oppose it, and will consider that in determining their vote next year.  And you do know that 'energy' is more than oil and gas, no?

1085 2018-11-30 22:10:36 You live in a red state (that has oil). That’s the ONLY reason he cares about Alaska (and not the people that happen to live there).

1087 2018-11-30 22:10:31 The worst kind of con-man, the dream leech. A classic flimflam artist cons greedy folk who want something for nothing. But the dream leech preys on folk who have a dream by pretending they will help them achieve it. The remedy recipe includes tar, feathers and boiling oil.#trumpU
1088 2018-11-30 22:10:22 If an oil producer does not care about market share then they would cut production to raise the price. If Russia cut by 10% the price would probably rise 20%. Higher income and lower expenses at the same time plus added resources in the ground.

1090 2018-11-30 22:10:16 And I wonder why Igbo is d only tribe in the whole universe that pronounces ''oil'' as ''oyel''

1091 2018-11-30 22:10:10 To me, and the information I have seen, car companies and oil companies have known for decades what it was doing to the environment and that there were more environment friendly options or pathways. And they fought to suppress or delete that information.

1097 2018-11-30 22:09:38 That happened over 75 years ago. The atrocities in Yemen and the murder of Khashoggi are much, much more recent. I can't wait until we don't need Saudi oil anymore.
1098 2018-11-30 22:09:33 Exactly! We want a real USMCA deal, then we should develop and build infrastructure to move oil and goods between us freely. It would help Mexico and kill illegal immigration. Mexicans ain't our enemy. We should invest in our neighbors, not the middle east.
1099 2018-11-30 22:09:32 He must be being ironic? Matt Canavan said he wanted children in school learning about how to build mines, do geology and how to drill for oil and gas?

1106 2018-11-30 22:08:59 The Globe's Jeff Lewis and Renata D'Aliesio write that the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission said new rules for the restoration of dormant oil and gas wells will include timelines, in an abrupt departure from existing regulations that let companies put off cleanup indefinitely.
1107 2018-11-30 22:08:57 Government actually had nothing to do with the oil prices mr. Obama's talking about in his administration corporations. Oil went up for those corps.  many states were upset with him for the hindrance he gave

1125 2018-11-30 22:07:37 The Globe and Mail reports in its Friday, Nov. 30, edition that British Columbia will impose timelines to clean up thousands of idle oil and gas wells and Saskatchewan has pledged to study the measure as regulators scramble to address a looming financial and environmental crisis.
1126 2018-11-30 22:07:36 Really dark days for some shale oil. Biggest drop in WTI futures since 2008, but Permian Basin WTI ends November at $42.40 bbl while ND Bakken hangs barely above $40 bbl. Benchmark futures outperformed the physical markets.
1127 2018-11-30 22:07:29 He picks it up on his shovel, crossed the street and dumps it in the road on our side because my landlord told him to stop dumping it on our front lawn.  He also washed the actual road with Dawn soap once too because it had oil drips or something, like 50m of it

1132 2018-11-30 22:07:05 Also nonsense such as the rule that olive oil can only be sold (to consumers) in maximum quantities of 5 litres. Olive oil fraud is relevant in the Med, but why does the UK or Germany (for example) need this law? It doesn’t, but under EU law it has to be applied in all states.
1133 2018-11-30 22:06:52 @MikeCompany17 you should do a video on standered oil
1134 2018-11-30 22:06:37 Don't be silly, Paradise, like Puerto Rico doesn't have oil reserves.

1142 2018-11-30 22:05:12 And oil.
1143 2018-11-30 22:05:10 No, just the fact that Alaska has oil, unlike Puerto Rico, Florida or Paradise CA where he blamed the victims.
1144 2018-11-30 22:05:09 That's a co2 rich atmosphere for ya.

And, we are definitely going to run out of oil, definitely. So our way of life was always in danger either way, better to start transitioning sooner rather than later 

But no, the climate change is dangerous
1145 2018-11-30 22:04:59 My S9+ gave life to that oil splashed on the beef...hmmmm. the pixel quality got me Imagining flavors.. how did I even get here...
1146 2018-11-30 22:04:36 Not an essential oil, but I’m confident neem oil would do the trick. Smells like old barbecue sauce with hints of rancid meat and butt. Apparently it also helps boost hair growth so you can go for full “don’t sit next to me on the bus” mode.
1147 2018-11-30 22:04:20 This is pure crap the Saudis should not be there in the first place only reason is because of  oil and money other  than that  they are not a world power yes CIA proved the prince ordered the asssination of the journalist macron, Putin, all of them  hypocrites fuck Saudi Arabia .

1149 2018-11-30 22:04:18 Also that's an old article. Have you not seen oil prices? I haven't seen such low gas prices in 5+ years. Good work with the useless article though.

1158 2018-11-30 22:03:22 WTI Crude fell briefly bellow $50 today. This while all the oil economy folks were meeting at the #G20Summit2018. Not a good sign for Russia and KSA IMO.
1159 2018-11-30 22:03:11 Isnt the fact that the oil industry is struggling so much a good reason to develop new sources of power?
1160 2018-11-30 22:02:58 You mean the province that Norway based their oil program but then that same province couldn’t even stick it its own plan and now has no money while Norway’s fund hit a trillion dollars last year?
1161 2018-11-30 22:02:58 Chilli infused oil!
1162 2018-11-30 22:02:57 Why don’t you actively research what is really happening in the oil industry instead of blindly believing the propaganda spewed by these funded activist groups.
1163 2018-11-30 22:02:46 They did'nt start riots. Others were responsible for that. 
And its not just for the oil prices. Its for the corrupt governments. The oil price was the last straw. 
These people are the working class. They struggle to pay their bills every month.
1164 2018-11-30 22:02:43 Not 1 drop of foreign oil should be used in Canada.

1167 2018-11-30 22:02:30 Normally I wouldn’t agree with you but I like to know why we buy oil from them when we have oil production. What’s the equipment or process charge needed for us to refine our tar instead of their oil?

1171 2018-11-30 22:02:05 Everyone is freaking out about differentials in oil (fair) but it’s come to light that even if we could send it directly though a pipeline, it likely would NOT change the price much
1172 2018-11-30 22:02:00 Quenching does not necessarily need to be in oil. It depends on which heat treatment. You should have been paying attention in class instead of drawing knobs!

1217 2018-11-30 21:59:36 After I get my oil changed at the dealership, I sit there like I really care about what they’re saying is wrong with my car from the so called inspection, then I say I’ll think about it, pay for the oil, and rip the printout up. Just here for the free carwash bruh.
1218 2018-11-30 21:59:14 thank you President，the oil price lower，and I save a lot money.
I am from china
1219 2018-11-30 21:59:08 American media ignored over a week of hard working Parisians rioting over climate change tax increases which hiked gas to over $7gal. When they finally covered riots #FakeNews attributed discontent over gas ‘prices’ (blame Big Oil ; ) ). Somehow they found dopey kids whining.
1220 2018-11-30 21:59:05 I don't like to blame the people that bought the snake oil, I blame the salesman.
1221 2018-11-30 21:59:04 When Russia and Saudi Arabia are united, oil prices will not be able to afford them 

Be aware of that
1222 2018-11-30 21:59:02 Ya Already know 
1223 2018-11-30 21:58:56 Thank u California rain for flooding the streets and causing me to bottom out in a dip that wasn’t visible now I have a cracked oil pan and out of commission car!!! =-)

As a citizen of Canada, I call on the Prime Minister to go further & condemn specifically the brutal actions of SA’s Crown Prince MBS & the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. BAN Saudi oil! END arms sales! REDEEM yourself after Cuba! #humanrights #Yemen
1225 2018-11-30 21:58:53 Real deal. Oil production cut coming.

1228 2018-11-30 21:58:42 Hay Ryan, if you happen to see this post, we in CA worked hard to remove republicans from office, because you've proved you are incapable of governing. You forget, it's government by the people, not by oil, gun or large corporations.

1231 2018-11-30 21:58:22 Saute mode, put some oil in the pot, when it's hot add half a diced onion and a dice celery rib.  Once those are soft and have some color toss in a whole bunch of whole peeled garlic (I used two heads, could have done more).
1232 2018-11-30 21:58:21 adding oil to the flames!
1233 2018-11-30 21:58:19 CBD is snake oil. Don’t @ me.
1234 2018-11-30 21:58:17 She swears by the oil!
1235 2018-11-30 21:58:16 The fact that he is a snake oil salesman is apparent then and now. He needs a HUGE staff to help him keep is lies straight and it still isn’t enough. He will look good in an orange jumpsuit.

1239 2018-11-30 21:57:28 Agreed. I thought I sucked at art for a long time. Then realized it was some of the items were junky, and not working the way intended. If you do get a kit, just make sure you avoid oils and oil pastels from a clean up/storage stand point.
1240 2018-11-30 21:57:24 Even though #Texas & #Nebraska are the #1 & #2 oil exporters IN THE WORLD & @realDonaldTrump gave the industry YUGE tax breaks, the #AlaskaEarthquake will be blamed for outrageous increases of at the pump gasoline prices.

1243 2018-11-30 21:56:50 The National Marine Fisheries Service issued Incidental Hazard Authorizations (IHAs) to five companies that want to conduct seismic testing off the Atlantic coast, which threatens marine wildlife -- all for the pursuit of oil that we don’t need.
1244 2018-11-30 21:56:45 Jiffy Lube charged me $88 for a fucking oil change, how has life tried you lately?
1245 2018-11-30 21:56:40 that's the injustice, Obama could, left the country with a debt 5 times higher, never proposed immigration law, did nothing for the country and dares to say that the result of oil is the arrogant, the two gas pipelines not the allowed
1246 2018-11-30 21:56:20 Trump: *takes credit for literally everything and claims he alone is fixing everything*
His fans: so awesome 
Obama: *this one time taking credit for oil*
Trumpers: so arrogant ugh disgusting how can he act that way
1247 2018-11-30 21:56:09 How can the modern conservative viewpoint be represented in a way that isn't logically flawed?  The entire party is built on a foundation of psychological snake oil profiteering.
1248 2018-11-30 21:56:00 These people really think acting lije terrorist and starting riots will lower the oil/gas prices? Do any of these people have jobs?
1249 2018-11-30 21:55:59 The black tint ofcourse
1250 2018-11-30 21:55:36 I need a nice fire crackling sound, myself. Though I'm looking for a fire in an oil barrel. :P
1251 2018-11-30 21:55:20 We’re getting Dalts oil changed and the dude pops up in the window and dalton goes “You scared the shit out of me man”  so the dude says, “Well man you might wanna go clean yourself up don’t no one like riding with shit in their pants”  and I am DEAD
1252 2018-11-30 21:55:13 Angola is expected to experience a 4th consecutive year of recession in 2019. Scary movie with both NPLs and arrears from government to corporates at record High. Add to that oil output depletion as a result of structural underinvestment.
1253 2018-11-30 21:55:12 if you see me dousing myself in peppermint oil, mind your falalalafucking business
1254 2018-11-30 21:55:11 *tries to exude big dick energy while getting my oil changed by myself* 

*still gets called “dear” and “baby” by old white men*
1255 2018-11-30 21:55:03 add a small drop of peppermint oil for some candy cane goodness! That's what the internet says, not that I would personally know at all. 
1256 2018-11-30 21:54:59 I always preferred to think of it as sacred chrism, but “oil” is ok I guess.
1257 2018-11-30 21:54:58 Pay the same price / barrel for Western Can Oil and the increased Royalties would pay for the pipeline.

1260 2018-11-30 21:54:44 Only ever went to one travel agent (oil city) and it was ridiculous. Way overpriced. I hear the one in Meadville isngood though
1261 2018-11-30 21:54:43 Today I got my dog groomed & my oil changed... that took almost 5 hours.

#ihateadulting
1262 2018-11-30 21:54:36 So I know essential oils are sort of a crunchy-trendy thing, but as someone who gets headaches frequently peppermint oil has straight up been a game changer for me.
1263 2018-11-30 21:54:27 ほとんど嘘やなぁ～
　あっ、おはよーございます！
1264 2018-11-30 21:54:27 Good day to get an oil change!
1265 2018-11-30 21:54:24 It is one of the most beautiful chart that shows, why WTI oil couldn't even touch 80$, and those 100$-300$ predictions were pure BS. The maximum price of oil was where US10Y touched MA200 and that was 75$. Now time for rates to go much lower and we all know what does it mean.

1268 2018-11-30 21:54:13 Thanks Eric.  Workers in the oil patch need solutions that the liberals are hard pressed to find.

1272 2018-11-30 21:53:57 1) We were never dependent on their oil.  2) With the condition that they stonewall Mueller 3) From what I just read, it was less Trump policy, and more Americans defending themselves from attack 4) Patriot batteries aren't much good against nukes
1273 2018-11-30 21:53:56 Yes, but given the propensity of the oil patch for mass layoffs, a specific threat like that would result in a strong reaction on the part of those who work in the field.

1280 2018-11-30 21:53:16 Bull! That cut put over 100 in my check and thank goodness because oil and propane prices are ridiculous! If you cared about your state you would have done something!
1281 2018-11-30 21:53:14 You ever think about how Dawn has to cover some innocent birds in oil just to shoot their commercials?
1282 2018-11-30 21:53:01 You seem like a bit slow; the west African ports were used for trades in Africa, including slaves(previously) and minerals from Africa. Now the Nigerian port is used for oil, minerals,African products, to North America and Europe.

1284 2018-11-30 21:52:48 Narcissistic to the MAX. He didn’t want America to produce more oil. He told “We The People” that America’s best days were behind us. Told us that a 1% economic growth wasn’t too bad, and this is the 
“New Normal.”
1285 2018-11-30 21:52:46 I marched in the 90s (as a teen) against war for oil and again in the 00s (as a twenty-something) against the invasion of Iraq (under the pretext of WMDs which were non existent). I wasn’t manipulated. I still believe in what I was marching for. Oil wars have a lot to answer for.
1286 2018-11-30 21:52:46 Alberta's economy is being pounded by cheaper Permian oil from the US. Oil sands are expensive & not worth extracting. The hysterical reaction from Notley that ur witnessing is because the clock is ticking & she knows Alberta's about to be a province with zero revenue.
1287 2018-11-30 21:52:17 Earthquake Strikes Southern Alaska, Threatening Oil Exports Oh NO! higher gas prices Cannot wait to see who Jackass trump blames that on. Oil & gas prices rising.

1290 2018-11-30 21:51:57 Oil Nations do tend to stick together. Putin wants a southern port is reason for Ukraine & Crimea and over a million Russians died trying to protect the world from Chernobyl.  I have not forgotten that or Glasnost. I do not believe Ukraine has $$ to take care of Chernobyl.
1291 2018-11-30 21:51:40 Oh? You saw sexual exploitation of women first hand during your time in the oil patch? I call bull. He is wrong, and so are you. While a portion of the men are uncouth to say the least, the largest "impact" they have is the massive benefit to rural service economies.
1292 2018-11-30 21:51:23 All oil free yet not drying at all. All are glowy.

1302 2018-11-30 21:50:49 Oil is so 1897. Grow up and quit dragging your feet on Climate Change and maybe take a night course in Climate Science. There is enough solar power landing on the earth every single day to power mankind for a Millennium. Why didn't you tag @cathmckenna in this Tweet? Be braver.

1310 2018-11-30 21:49:42 I was on Proactiv + other similar products for years. My skin was awful. I changed to using tea tree oil for spot treatment, jojoba oil and gentle moisturizer every day. My skin reacted much better to the more natural products
1311 2018-11-30 21:49:39 Amazingly negative sentiment when you have a massive earthquake close the Alaskan pipeline with an unknown prognosis and #WTI #oil still hammered into close..This is what bottom forming sentiment blowouts look like.... #oott
1312 2018-11-30 21:49:34 my oil change and engine light came on today, got locked out of my car, the battery died.. and several hours later when I could finally use it, I almost got pulled over. hows ur friday goin???
1313 2018-11-30 21:49:32 I gave them 3 mins in the deep fat fryer, then finished them off in the oven. You can shallow fry them in a cm of oil on both sides then finish them in the oven the same way.
1314 2018-11-30 21:49:27 I can  go so very angry about this and other oil spills - it's so frustrating ..... time and time again.

1316 2018-11-30 21:49:17 The country building its entire economy on the price of oil is what brought them to where they are. That and the leadership being embarrassing corrupt.

1322 2018-11-30 21:48:40 I'm confused. I thought odumbo wanted electric cars & wanted to price the oil & coal companies out of business to lower the carbon footprint. Now he's saying that he increased carbon emissions? It's hard to follow left wing loons.

1324 2018-11-30 21:48:22 So although oil companies and others get all kinds of subsidies when it comes to clean energy, any incentives would be “picking winners and losers”.  How blatant can they be?
1325 2018-11-30 21:48:05 Looks like Putin has found a new BFF. An $85/barrel oil price would benefit Putin an Mohammed bin Salaman much more than any simple Trump Tower in Moscow or Riyadh/Mecca would.

We've depleted the oil that tectonic plates float on by drilling and extraction of oil.

DAMN YOU, OIL COMPANIES!!!
1331 2018-11-30 21:47:36 Rachel Notley's latest oil plan isn't going to do anything toward protection either. More railcars for oil equals more risk for salmon.
1332 2018-11-30 21:47:32 Try using vitamin E oil & maybe sprits water on your scalp with a spray bottle before putting oil so you can trap some type of moisture, my scalp is super dry too so it sucks up oil QUICK

1336 2018-11-30 21:47:07 COOKING FIRE SAFETY
Never leave kitchen while frying food
Heat oil slowly
Immediately turn off burner when you smell or see wisps of smoke 
Never overfill pans or cause oil splatter & overflow
Make sure food is completely thawed
Never throw water on a grease fire
1337 2018-11-30 21:46:56 Which oil? Nigeria extracts crude oil and sells to others,then buys the refined products back from Intl players at higher prices,then subsidizes it to its people cos corruption has killed all 4 state owned refineries. So Saudi ain't our mates,they lift and refine their crude.
1338 2018-11-30 21:46:53 I have a deep fat fryer. An air fryer would knock all the coating off as it stirred it around. You can shallow fry them in a cm of oil, on a medium heat on the hob, then finish in the oven.

1351 2018-11-30 21:45:47 Thanks, Jacques. I guess you missed the part where I asked you for names of the scientists you claimed were "on the payroll of oil companies".

1352 2018-11-30 21:45:45 They did?

I only know about the Chinese, that they agreed to buy oil and gas against the Yuan. 

If a high five comes with Xi, than the party can really start
1353 2018-11-30 21:45:28 Just in case you ever bake a cake always add one extra egg and extra butter or Oil.  Also use milk and never water
1354 2018-11-30 21:45:07 Boil chickpeas until soft, drain, mash up with olive oil, garlic and salt. Hummus. If you have a lot top strainer it can be one pot too
1355 2018-11-30 21:45:03 Funny when Jason doesn't know the difference between a plan and a list of outcomes, nor that the government doesn't decide oil prices. College dropout to the rescue!!

1366 2018-11-30 21:43:22 The Trump administration is set to allow companies to HARVEST WHALE OIL in the Atlantic Ocean — a process that could harm whales, dolphins and other marine life....FAKE NEWS but for a moment .....you believed it.
1367 2018-11-30 21:43:22 Norway has an oil fund to pay the fees for EFTA membership, but we have a kids Post Office account that has contained about £1.29 since we bought our first phone.
1368 2018-11-30 21:43:19 Xi signed a deal with MBS, that is Saudi Arabia oil for Chinese jet fighters and a aircraft carrier. But Trump has nothing to offer.
1369 2018-11-30 21:43:05 Yet another round of devaluation $=140 followed by large hike in interest rate (150 basis points) to 10% at a time when oil prices have dropped by 25% prospectively saving 5 billion dollars is beyond economic comprehension. Pure panic, incompetence!

1391 2018-11-30 21:41:00 1. Resources Minister Matt Canavan wants children in school learning about how to build mines, do geology and how to drill for oil and gas, "which is one of the most remarkable science exploits in the world".

"These are the type of things that excite young children.”
1392 2018-11-30 21:40:59 Transports leading under the guise they’re only up bc of oil
1393 2018-11-30 21:40:57 You just highlighted why he considers it to be a snake oil science. The argument I’ve heard (which is the same in terms of economics) is that economists and poli scientists weight aggregate statistics too heavily, vs. the variability between individuals.
1394 2018-11-30 21:40:54 how was i dumb enough to put fucking canola oil into my water bottle thinking it was apple juice

Alaska has oil.
Puerto Rico does not.
1420 2018-11-30 21:37:49 Who own #Potus ??? In May, #trump left #IranDeal. #MBS and OPEC+ raised #oil output n prevented #oil prices to skyrocket. #Potus was bluffing and didn't enforce #IranSanctions. There is an #oil glut and #oil prices declined. KSA n US shale oil rely on #oil prices to survive.
1421 2018-11-30 21:37:48 Skulle nog passa in mellan Altria, Coca-cola och Macdonalds. Sen fattas typ bara Lundin Oil eller BP så går vi emot det mesta med etiska investeringar.

1440 2018-11-30 21:36:05 Green will happen.  Once investors see the other green of $$$, they will swoop in.  Renewables will replace crude oil!  Instead of oil pipelines, desalination pipelines from the coast!  If every new home build was required solar, think of the jobs or gasp, no power bill.

1445 2018-11-30 21:35:27 Don't forget the deal Carter Page made for trump to personally gain 19% ownership in Rosneft oil in exchange for lifting oil drilling and Magnitsky sanctions. He could GAIN $$$$ BILLIONS. To me, that's what he wanted the most.

1471 2018-11-30 21:32:35 That’s because very few oil tankers are loaded out of Westridge. That’s the whole point of the Trans Mountain expansion. Twinning the line to Westridge for the purpose of loading oil tankers.
1472 2018-11-30 21:32:31 Or because if the Dem Party’s complacency & compromise over climate change continues, we’ll fail to meet the 12 year deadline the UN have given us to avoid permanent damage that leads to the destruction & ultimate end of our planet?  But go ahead- thank him for oil.

1486 2018-11-30 21:31:02 Yeah Oliver, exactly! Those hacks at Buzzfeed should do real journalism like you guys do, by say throwing a climate expert's scheduled interview away so you can air Rick Santorum shilling for the oil industry.
1487 2018-11-30 21:30:49 may dadating sayong di mo inaasahan; pero hindi siya tao. yung oil pastel mo to na hiniram ko sayo hahahahahaha
1488 2018-11-30 21:30:46 Twerp. Apparently, Fort McMurray in the oil patch has or had one of the highest rates of STD's in the country.
1489 2018-11-30 21:30:27 Let’s not forget Rex Tillerson. I think he will be making a return appearance soon. There was something afoot with oil. As always.
1490 2018-11-30 21:30:26 Sis didn’t have not one Cocoa product in that bathroom! No oil products in sight!!
1491 2018-11-30 21:30:26 i’m SO SAD. i’m allergic to mint. i love peppermint oil so much that sometimes i just risk it lmao.

1494 2018-11-30 21:30:13 I am a dry skinned woman in Norway. I use ALL OF THE LOTION and it makes no difference  I even tried putting oil on after lotion, but two hours later I’m dry again. Winter is the worst. Maybe a lot of other wpp just gave up 
1495 2018-11-30 21:30:07 Eating rosemary & olive oil flavored triscuits with some cheese pretending it's a full blown charcuterie platter
1496 2018-11-30 21:30:01 Step up and drop cute pictures too
1497 2018-11-30 21:29:58 But the super, brilliant, fantastic, incredible trade deals will be for oil, energy sector, whiskey, salmon etc, all of which come from , therefore the...

Simple answer is....

Yip  bye bye.
1498 2018-11-30 21:29:54 It's also illegal to make deals to lift Russian sanctions in exchange for a personal gain of 19% in Rosneft oil.
1499 2018-11-30 21:29:48 I hope you know Alaska is kinda of far away and not connected to the rest of the continental United States. I don’t want you to be surprised later to hear this.
However it does have oil you want to exploit, so you probably know exactly where it is.
1500 2018-11-30 21:29:48 just passed a sign in front of a health store, “opiates or cbd oil...you decide.” wow it’s so simple
1501 2018-11-30 21:29:25 No. You need to see MORTAL ANNUAL OIL CHANGE AND COOLANT SEASONAL CHECK-UP.
1502 2018-11-30 21:29:20 how does an oil change take almost two hours to complete let me know
1503 2018-11-30 21:29:12 Do you like aaaart? Come by the MFF art show and check out my stuff, and bid if you see something you like! Oil painting, MeryCollie poster, and some lovely bird ladies for your viewing enjoyment @ back right end cap
1504 2018-11-30 21:29:02 That wasn't oil and it wasn't for straightening anymore than skoal and Slim Jim's are for white boy's cologne...
1505 2018-11-30 21:28:57 Vegans of India - how do you make rasam/sambhar without adding tadka in ghee? I suggested coconut oil tadka-fication to my family and they looked at me the way I look at people who drink instant coffee. Do suggest!
1506 2018-11-30 21:28:51 There's beard oil being sold on these Twitter Street
1507 2018-11-30 21:28:42 I really think coconut oil stinks, but i love the way it feels.
1508 2018-11-30 21:28:28 يا ربّ
إن ضاق الفضا 
وتفرّقت في الدرب
أقدام الشتات
يا ربَّ بوصلة الحياة
يمّم إليك هوى فؤادي
أنتَ ربي 
واعتمادي 
الدرب فيه مشقةٌ
والصبر يا رحمن زادي 
1509 2018-11-30 21:28:11 A (crude) oil barrel, how apt.
1510 2018-11-30 21:28:00 @RepDeSantis as Governor, don’t let Trump start seismic tests in our waters. It hurts and kills dolphins and other marine life. Please, Florida is a tourism State now an oil drilling state.
1511 2018-11-30 21:27:54 @JustinTrudeau likes oil pipleines
1512 2018-11-30 21:27:40 I went to Walmart to get an oil change and they said they are out of oil... bruh HOW
1513 2018-11-30 21:27:28 Cough syrup and efficascent oil for the weekend 
1514 2018-11-30 21:27:21 OIL .... He and MBS wanted Iran out of the big boys game; Trump accommodated.  Putin also got his pipeline and, remember, Trump wasn't finished - he had all the infrastructure to sell off.  PLUS - the added value to see the USA embarrassed & weakened.
1515 2018-11-30 21:27:08 Oil Pan Alley
1516 2018-11-30 21:27:05 Gave my much, much beloved cat another year and a half with us. Highly recommend a good CBD oil source for all kinds of pain treatment. #tohellwithcancer
1517 2018-11-30 21:27:02 mom made me go get my oil changed by myself.. i’m actually freaking out
1518 2018-11-30 21:26:51 The most amazing feeling is getting out the shower & drenching your face with coconut  oil 
1519 2018-11-30 21:26:42 LMAO oil na oil
1520 2018-11-30 21:26:32 100% natural, the products by the lake. Organic Essential oils, and raw organic coconut oil. Authentic and holistic healing.
1521 2018-11-30 21:26:31 who wants to buy me a weed pen and oil for xmas???
1522 2018-11-30 21:26:29 If she get her oil changed once a year ... that pussy probably amazing.
1523 2018-11-30 21:26:28 The day I used oil paint is the day I officially called myself an artist. It’s life changing
1524 2018-11-30 21:26:22 My korres wild rose vitamin c oil broke
1525 2018-11-30 21:26:02 That’s even the coolest argument!! Why import stinky oil from mostly corrupt countries and then burn it to even more stink in our precious environment. Let’s get rid of it and rid of the dependency. Love it!!!
1526 2018-11-30 21:25:45 So trudeau thinks male construction workers are a threat to rural centers, I would suggest that due to the slow down in the oil patch that many of these centers are barely hanging on and would disagree with him completely.
1527 2018-11-30 21:25:36 I am sooooo thankful for @realDonaldTrump getting this economy moving and making the United States a massive oil producer, but mostly I’m glad he’s erasing all of Obummer’s evil deeds. Thank you so much President Trump. And please just retire and go play golf @BarackObama
1528 2018-11-30 21:25:33 changed roxy's and my oil today 
and got my wheel bearing replaced
CAR DAY
1529 2018-11-30 21:25:27 Putin is a clever politician, although he is a criminal who knows that when he has good relations with the world's biggest oil producer, it will be very useful for the Russian economy
1530 2018-11-30 21:25:25 Oh,  kind of like Hillary and Barack staging the murder of Momar Kadafie. I guess it's ok to murder foreign leaders if they plan on putting oil up for sale for non-US dollars. Or because they can just lie about why they did it.  Oh,  that's right they did and 4 Americans died
1531 2018-11-30 21:25:21 You look more happy and proud of your arm for reaching back there and proud of the oil finding it's way down 
1532 2018-11-30 21:25:08 Nope.  He is trying to get a contract to build nuclear reactors in Saudi because they have been massively overstating their oil reserves for years and everyone in the oil business knows this.
1533 2018-11-30 21:25:08 It's incrementalism.

The standards didn't need to be in place until 2025, and the next guy who got into the White House waived the need for the industry to improve at all.

Point is, it's continuing to support the oil industry instead of subsidizing alternatives.
1534 2018-11-30 21:25:07 Macron: “can you please lower the oil price for France?.. I am in trouble with yellow jackets”
1535 2018-11-30 21:24:58 lee, snake oil is useful medicine
1536 2018-11-30 21:24:50 Alberta made a net contribution to the Federal Government of $221 billion from 2007-2015.

Blocking pipelines only blocks Canada's prosperity from coast to coast while helping other oil and gas producing countries.
1537 2018-11-30 21:24:44 Is it? He's bragging about expanding oil production. He's doing it. He's saying this now. Why isn't he ashamed?
1538 2018-11-30 21:24:37 To be fair, the ellipsis’d part of what he says changes the entire context – he’s no longer talking about oil production, but about how his admin. helped the country recover from the recession.
1539 2018-11-30 21:24:32 “if you even THINK about using MY taxes for universal health care  INSTEAD of funding wars in the Middle East for the profit of oil companies/the military industrial-complex, I WILL kill all the sick poor people MYSELF. fuccin libtards”
1540 2018-11-30 21:24:30 He is not ready to make another one now... Cus if add d oil... He would have to throw these ones away... And that's waste u knw.. Em no get power
1541 2018-11-30 21:24:05 I doubt that people’s jobs were that much at risk. Or, in any event, jobs were subsequently lost later when oil prices fell. In the interim, government finances have been worse.
1542 2018-11-30 21:24:04 Cauliflower, Coconut oil, Ginger, Turmeric Stew – Amazing!
1543 2018-11-30 21:23:59 Can't sleep? Use lavender essential oil in your bath. You will sleep like a baby.
1544 2018-11-30 21:23:53 มาทำตอนนี้ก็ error 
1545 2018-11-30 21:23:50 Yes. And today bc of oil and politics and hatred of Israel, the United Nations General Assembly is a LYING ass.
1546 2018-11-30 21:23:48 Nothing they did benefited him. Has he paid them back by lessening our dependence on their oil, giving arms to Ukraine, blowing up their mercenaries in Syria, approving MDS in Poland, or dropping deal with their client state Iran? How about rebuking Germany for Nordsteam deal?
1547 2018-11-30 21:23:42 Psalm 55:21  words as smooth as butter, but war is in their heart... words as soothing as oil, but they are drawn swords...
1548 2018-11-30 21:23:23 The only reason Obama can say he is responsible for the oil boom and economy is because of all the stupid leftist that believe it.
1549 2018-11-30 21:23:17 I have top quality boots that don't wreck my feet, but still. Slippers or flip-flops for me. There's no reason to look like a dope and support a lunatic's business in the process with other options out there.
1550 2018-11-30 21:23:10 @RepLarryBucshon @SenDonnelly @SenToddYoung: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast
1551 2018-11-30 21:23:06 females get a car and don’t check the oil, tire pressure, or coolant. as long as that mf start up and her speakers work she ready to roll
1552 2018-11-30 21:23:02 You can wash the roller out to reuse. I think I gave you a small vial with some pure oil though. I can not remember. If I did then it is ok.
1553 2018-11-30 21:23:00 The market needed a strong week to avoid the first down November in 7 years and that is exactly what we got.
For the week:
Dow +5.2%
S&P 500 +4.9%
NASDAQ +5.6%
Russell +3%
Oil unchanged
Gold +.2%
1554 2018-11-30 21:22:58 If you had a Communist system it wouldn't be Exxon, it would be the Party's Undersecretary for Oil. But you can be sure that whoever it is that someone's job would be at stake, and that someone would try to fudge the numbers.
1555 2018-11-30 21:22:58 Yes, the riches in the north wants sharia law with oil in the south, while Boko Haram wants only total sharia independence without oil in the south, that’s why there is division among themselves,
1556 2018-11-30 21:22:50 You lobbying the grocery suppliers and oil companies as well?
1557 2018-11-30 21:22:45 at the mechanics waiting for an oil change and this dude won’t shut up
1558 2018-11-30 21:22:42 It is now 3 and half years since Buhari became the president of Nigeria and minister for petroleum but no sane Nigerian or foreigner has accused him of stealing oil block or taking a dime.

Buhari is indeed a man of great moral value.
We are proud of him.

1559 2018-11-30 21:22:38 need to order some coconut oil and castor oil for rose hair
1560 2018-11-30 21:22:35 Will you be paying us more than $12 a barrel for our oil now?
1561 2018-11-30 21:22:33 I can't believe I have to say this...Don't go to the bath bomb shop at the mall to yell at the staff about the fucking oil sands.
1562 2018-11-30 21:22:29 Yes lol we went to purchase oil for my friends car and he gave us our money back. So we got fere oil too
1563 2018-11-30 21:22:27 the price u mentioned here is it in your own market?an oil producing country that has no functioning refinery,it is a shame.
1564 2018-11-30 21:22:22 Lafiya bro
1565 2018-11-30 21:22:18 I swore I was gonna be home in time to get an oil change 
1566 2018-11-30 21:22:17 Getting an oil change and then I’m going to wash my babyy
1567 2018-11-30 21:22:12 using grape seed oil as a carrier back then I think and it goes rancid after about 6 months. So if there is any left of the roller dump it.
1568 2018-11-30 21:22:11 Lebanese are like Fulani in Nigeria. They are above the law and enjoy more liberties here than they enjoy in their own country. Again the only economy PMB understand is the economy of Oil price .The talk about diversification is just motivational. They aren't diversifying
1569 2018-11-30 21:22:10 Congrats Mark on your deal with @KraftHeinzCo your Greek Avocado Oil Salad dressing is fantastic. For all those concerned @CampbellSoupCo bought @pacificfoods years ago and that soup has maintained it’s high quality.
1570 2018-11-30 21:21:45 Really, just yesterday Obama was patting himself on the back for turning the US into the largest oil producer in the world. Furthermore the Obama administration was specifically responsible for watering down the Paris treaty.
1571 2018-11-30 21:21:43 Agree that one should not purchase products containing unsustainable palm oil. But more important is to demand deforestation-free palm oil.
1572 2018-11-30 21:21:41 I second this! Tea tree oil shampoos are where it’s at for dry scalp
1573 2018-11-30 21:21:35 Yo, if you need to chat / vent I'm off work waiting on an oil change.
1574 2018-11-30 21:21:32 I still believe that Hillary is responsible for the chemical weapons. The oil surges after US strikes against syria
1575 2018-11-30 21:21:32 Two oil soaked butchers and a greasy child jailer.
1576 2018-11-30 21:21:20 I don’t understand.  We have worlds 3rd largest oil reserves.  A Capable Educated work force.  A safe stable environment.  What’s not to love ?
1577 2018-11-30 21:21:18 Благодарю от всего сердца 
1578 2018-11-30 21:21:18 Yes and change their own oil
1579 2018-11-30 21:21:17 Who cares...they're taking a legal, principled stand against something.  They could be testing on animals,  or much, much worse. But in Uber-sensitive Alberta, feelings get hurt when people slam our Oil. It's embarrassing and pathetic.
1580 2018-11-30 21:21:12 I disagree. It takes decades to build a refinery, so if we decommission one, that oil is off the market forever.
1581 2018-11-30 21:21:02 Hell for Leather (1998) - Leather. Oil. Opera.
1582 2018-11-30 21:20:58 Ooh girl. Those rollers probbaly are not any good by now. Pure oil keeps but when you make rollers you dilute it with carrier oil. I was...
1583 2018-11-30 21:20:58 With oil prices being less than $30 US/barrel, why are we still paying so much at the pump???!!!  
For years the explanation has been high oil prices. Obviously that’s no longer the case so WHO is responsible for regularly ripping off Canadians with these fake prices?
1584 2018-11-30 21:20:56 Oil change:  
Patch on tires:  
Full tank:  
Dick out: 
1585 2018-11-30 21:20:54 This ethical model would mean oil companies are more responsible for climate change and have more responsibility to fix it, but this responsibility does not absolve others who also share responsibility and are obligated to make up for it by also acting to solve the problem.
1586 2018-11-30 21:20:49 I don’t think @cathmckenna is implying that at all. But the conservatives (both fed and prov) are very clearly politicizing this issue and blaming it on a carbon tax - a carbon tax that GM has already shown support for (as have other companies, including Shell oil!)
1587 2018-11-30 21:20:40 Has anyone actually been fined a significant amount of money or gone to jail for breach of the RSPO charter? No. They dont have the power to do that. They just get a slap on the wrists. But, hey, the palm oil industry’s image is improved so everyone’s a winner. Except rainforests
1588 2018-11-30 21:20:38 Wait till you try full spectrum oil then ;)
1589 2018-11-30 21:20:36 Ok i get "that's dish soap" "cardboard and motor oil" kill yourself.
1590 2018-11-30 21:20:35 Some duct tape and 3-in-1 oil should fix that right up.
1591 2018-11-30 21:20:23 How does my car goes in for only an oil change. 
There were no lights on when I brought it in for service. 
And when I come to pick my car up after they say everything is set the CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON??!!?!!  

How? 

This is delaying my day!!!!! 
1592 2018-11-30 21:20:09 Lightly looked??? At the Moscow project?  No, that was your idea of a bonus for running - from Putin -because Real Estate is your cover.
 
Putin quashed that - he knew how it would look - and he promised you even more and more for lifting sanctions on his banks, on his oil .

1599 2018-11-30 21:19:13 If you eliminated all fossil fuel generators and replaced with these farms, they require a fraction of the people to support, less jobs. If you ban all fossil fuels, 80% of the stuff your daily use includes derivatives from oil, phone cases, keyboards, TV's, you name it. 3/

1601 2018-11-30 21:19:02 Acne more often affects skin with a greater number of oil glands; these areas include the face, the upper part of the chest, and the back.

1611 2018-11-30 21:18:28 More effective than leading by example, is leading with compassion. US renewable energy use is up, but world CO2 production is also up. Poor countries are using more fossil fuels. Poor people don’t care if you ride a bike; they do care if you allow oil companies to do business.
1612 2018-11-30 21:18:28 And when they change their oil they pour it down the rain gutter and did you know the legal age for a man to rape a child in Mexico is 12 years lod

1614 2018-11-30 21:18:15 The palm oil industry realised they have an image problem. The RSPO is all about improving their image without doing anything to actually protect rainforests or restore degraded landscapes.

1623 2018-11-30 21:17:28 woooo if this cannabis oil helps w my pain and insomnia it’s over for u bitches
1624 2018-11-30 21:17:24 China is the biggest importer of Gulf oil. #justsaying
1625 2018-11-30 21:17:18 after allowing Russian military bases in SA and made billions of dollars deals with Russia and make oil 150$ which is good for both countries economies Russia will ally Saudi Arabia as saudi arabia a second Moscow
1626 2018-11-30 21:17:09 Agree!What I consider as common sense. But I guess the answer is MONEY and oil....
1627 2018-11-30 21:17:07 OPEC needs to cut oil production or USA is gonna suffer again
1628 2018-11-30 21:16:57 Alaska has oil!!! Trump will be al about helping the big oil companies that are potentially affected
1629 2018-11-30 21:16:55 Oil is on your head...
1630 2018-11-30 21:16:46 US Closing prices: #DOW 0.68% #NASDAQ 0.82% #Ftse100 -0.83% #GBPUSD 1.2744 #EURGBP 0.8882 #EURUSD 1.132 #Gold 0.11% #Oil -0.45%
1631 2018-11-30 21:16:44 :\ probably more later on ...idk. sigh. partly cos of global warming right or oil..
1632 2018-11-30 21:16:36 Nothing says “We are working hard” like cancelling an approved pipeline, banning ONLY AB oil from Prince Rupert, killing another with untenable legislation, and introducing Bill C69, which all but guarantees we’ll never have another pipeline applied for in this country.
1633 2018-11-30 21:16:30 Power of cheap oil to the west. What the kashoggi affair was all about from the beginning
1634 2018-11-30 21:16:25 Ehn Omo gambari ni 
1635 2018-11-30 21:16:24 One day Saudi oil will run out, and then what friends will they have?
1636 2018-11-30 21:16:17 Oil is crashing wtf
1637 2018-11-30 21:16:10 Very good analysis. Brexit is like an oil tanker in the democratic ocean being driven by the majority. If you attempt to turn it or reverse it you face a tragic toxic pollution of both politics and democracy.
1638 2018-11-30 21:16:10 Obama doesn't really believe he's responsible for the oil boom he's lying...I mean trying to convince low information people that he is.  WE KNOW BETTER.
1639 2018-11-30 21:16:09 These aren't the stories you see on the front pages.

1640 2018-11-30 21:16:09 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, however revisit them.
1641 2018-11-30 21:16:01 Kinda like Obama taking credit for the booming economy and the Oil Industry that he imposed so many regulations on....please
1642 2018-11-30 21:16:01 I need CBD Oil.
1643 2018-11-30 21:16:00 Stirring peanut butter is NOT my favorite activity.  There's a real fear of the oil escaping over the top of the jar and over the side.
1644 2018-11-30 21:15:52 How do you get fish oil? Maybe they just take the fish from the water and squeeze it and collect the oil and let it go after collecting it. #sleepytweets #bullcrap #comedy
1645 2018-11-30 21:15:50 They're oil buddies. They both produce enough of the stuff to influence world politics.
1646 2018-11-30 21:15:41 No no no no oil drilling offshore!
1647 2018-11-30 21:15:30 they really tried to snake oil salesman me by being like “the screen is BIG! it has ACCURATE COLOURS!” okay bitch but where are the PIXELS
1648 2018-11-30 21:15:17 I worked in the oil patch when I was younger. Trudeau isn't wrong, though given the likelihood you've never gotten your hands dirty doing manual labor I'm not surprised this is a foreign concept to you.

休んでて。
1651 2018-11-30 21:14:51 We need to move towards renewable energy. 
I feel that we shldn't even explore for oil in the cabora bassa (sp??) basin. The world is moving away from fossil fuels and we want to start drilling? We shld put our focus on mining minerals like lithium for batteries.
1652 2018-11-30 21:14:47 اتمنى عقوبة الي مايلتزم بالقرار يطفون الزقارة بمكوته..
1653 2018-11-30 21:14:39 kale needs to be fried up/baked with a lil olive oil, salt, and optionally lemon to be tasty imo
1654 2018-11-30 21:14:38 "The craziest and grooviest things in the world cannot be fondled or even cuddled - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
1655 2018-11-30 21:14:29 Kareem Hunt mistake was being around white women. Stick to black women. They are better in every way, plus they smell like coconut oil and not rancid cold cuts.
1656 2018-11-30 21:14:23 Snake oil circa 2018
1657 2018-11-30 21:14:22 Urban Meyer shows behavior of a snake oil salesman. Ridiculous.
1658 2018-11-30 21:14:22 They don't need canada, we need their oil and the jobs in Ontario from the armoured car deal. I guess you already forgot eh?
1659 2018-11-30 21:14:21 I trust the politicians will find a way to fuck the whole US oil thing up. If the world sets a new barrel  standard ( other than US dollar) it will imo, negatively impact the US economy
1660 2018-11-30 21:14:05 All about the arms and oil.
1661 2018-11-30 21:13:55 Or we need oil price lowering
1662 2018-11-30 21:13:54 Before you sleep today, don't forget to buy beard oil. I have them for 4k each.

1663 2018-11-30 21:13:41 One of my closest friends bought me an oil burner and ylang-ylang oil because I mentioned  that I missed the smell from when we were younger. It made my week
1664 2018-11-30 21:13:40 Ko gbo Yoruba.
1665 2018-11-30 21:13:29 That oil change could be $120-$200 you still winning
1666 2018-11-30 21:13:23 Public opinion? You mean SOME of the public’s opinion..Maybe even half of the public’s opinion? Certainly not the ENTIRE public’s opinion. That oil, which goes in your cars, is used in every plastic everything, roof shingles, your lipstick...needs to come from somewhere.
1667 2018-11-30 21:13:11 Maman yara how are you
1668 2018-11-30 21:13:04 & I realize we are in the "twilight of fossil fuels", but again, it's not a light switch & we're just not going to go from oil to "natures bounty" over the course of a week.
1669 2018-11-30 21:13:02 @TiwaSavage does your nose smell like hot oil

1671 2018-11-30 21:12:48 Closed caption - “what’s up my Siberian brother from another mother” “that’s right homie- that’s how we dos it- you got my oil mfer?”
1672 2018-11-30 21:12:40 Got it. It’s about misleading labeling and lack of transparency/consumer education. Similar to olive oil. My basic philosophy with both oils and tomatoes are taste a bunch and stick with what you like. Ignore the labeling completely.
1673 2018-11-30 21:12:33 it should be a law that when you become president you have to wear a shirt that says "i  oil" on it and you cant wear anything else for the rest of your life. even after you leave office
1674 2018-11-30 21:12:29 I mind. 
That needs to stop.
Why shouldn't we landlock their product just as they have landlocked our oil and gas ?!
1675 2018-11-30 21:12:25 Keith, with all due respect, I’m calling bullshit on this...This is the snake oil salesman talk.
1676 2018-11-30 21:12:22 "Just the ones in the northern part of Alaska. We're going to destroy their way of life and the migration routes of their food sources by drilling for oil!"
1677 2018-11-30 21:12:17 That’s a true Hanukkah miracle! Forget the 8 nights of oil.
1678 2018-11-30 21:12:00 And why did the economy crashed? Oil peaked in price, the started dropping. This affected many economies around the world and has nothing to do with the EU.
1679 2018-11-30 21:11:54 My 77 yo mom was worried she was gonna turn into a reefer addict since she uses cbd oil on her bum knee. But she now knows its very legal and very cool.

1691 2018-11-30 21:10:11 Also, this all started with “have the Libyans pay the US back in oil for bombing them” Neera trashing Sarah Jones on complete BS grounds.
1692 2018-11-30 21:10:11 @BarackObama meant "boom" as in blowing up the oil industry. 

So yeah, #KingBarryTheLast was responsible for that oil "boom".
1693 2018-11-30 21:10:10 There's diversifying & there's slowly abandoning oil. You really need to read a book or two. Tell me in what world is Alberta oil cheap to extract. And tailing ponds are going to be the cherry on top.
1694 2018-11-30 21:10:03 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。

1699 2018-11-30 21:09:44 @DanMurphyESPN Will you be at Lucas Oil tomorrow? Go Cats!!
1700 2018-11-30 21:09:41 Canada with egg on its face in the end. Besides the huffing, puffing by Freeland and a few ineffective sanctions, we still purchase their oil instead of Alberta oil and we just pray that SA will not cancel the armoured vehicle deal. Foreign policy disaster, SA, USA and India
1701 2018-11-30 21:09:37 Ole I learned is OIL lol
1702 2018-11-30 21:09:25 China refused to import oil and gas from the US
1703 2018-11-30 21:09:19 What she needs this evening, is a nice oil massage,a warm bubble bath with candles, tight hug and to be cuddled all night long.she will wake up very fine like nothing happened and believe me, she will even work harder
1704 2018-11-30 21:09:17 ไม่ เพราะคอนนี้ไม่ใช่ของหล่อนเพียงคนเดียว ถ้ามาเพื่อทำไปส่งๆเราก็ละหล่อนไว้ ทดไว้ในใจ แล้วหันไปหวีดสามหน่อต่อ ถ้ามาแล้วยังแสดงออกแบบว่า คิดว่าหาตังค่าขนมจากเราได้ง่ายๆ แค่เหวี่ยงๆแขนก็ตามกรี๊ดกันแล้ว นี่คงจะติดลบในลบไปเลย โดยส่วนตัวไม่ชอบให้คนมาถ่วงในงานทีม คิดว่าคอนหน้าอาจไม่ไป
1705 2018-11-30 21:09:14 Live in Texas oil country, Obama had us in a recession for three years, with his clean air regulations. We have a small real estate investment company, he nearly put us out of businesses, no one was was buying or renting houses.
1706 2018-11-30 21:08:52 Just deleted that Lush tweet. Someone sent a DM with info on how local Lush employees have had to deal with the fallout from the companies decision to operate against the oil sands. Safety issues.. which is not cool. Nobody should feel unsafe going to work. Fuck that noise.
1707 2018-11-30 21:08:42 Reading news reports that the $80m/day loss in #abecon oil revenues from differential prices may be exaggerated. Was it calculated on shortfall from every barrel? If so it's wrong b/c 60% #oilsands barrels are not caught.  #Albertans need straight facts not #rhetoric #Abpoli
1708 2018-11-30 21:08:35 ねぇねぇ
1709 2018-11-30 21:08:33 I swear I’ll drive my car into the ground before I get an oil change the shit takes up so much of the day
1710 2018-11-30 21:08:18 shaving your legs with coconut oil (vita coco brand) will have your legs feeling super soft 
1711 2018-11-30 21:08:18 True energy Independence and stable oil prices are at our fingertips. We will improve our cost basis per barrel if we invest in technology to produce sub $30 bbl. We get closer every day, but $50 WTI or below will kill it.
1712 2018-11-30 21:08:16 Я бы скинула, но... *шутка про ВК, Украину, и тупой интернет, который впн гробит нахер. А также про то, что я там не сижу хрен знает сколько*
1713 2018-11-30 21:08:12 Alberta government cabinet meeting this afternoon to discuss possible cuts to oil production. #ableg
1714 2018-11-30 21:08:09 Yes snake oil Donny..Alaska is part of the USA...did someone have to tell you?
1715 2018-11-30 21:08:06 I’d say that leading the world in oil production lowers the cost per barrel and increases the use not only here but also abroad. Much of that production increase was Fracking and we all know how environmentally friendly that is
1716 2018-11-30 21:07:57 Did you not read about GM & their plans for the future? ZERO gas powered models by 2022. Wait..... I see what's happening here. Your future depends on Alberta oil & you're trying to make yourself feel better because Alberta oil is dead. That's ok. You'll accept it soon.

1719 2018-11-30 21:07:48 Use urine with crude oil
1720 2018-11-30 21:07:44 So now your a Democrat? Using Government for this only enhances its power. Please realize that by breaking up Standard Oil they made Rockefeller 5x richer and accomplished nothing. Use your influence to get people to voluntarily quit google products or services.
1721 2018-11-30 21:07:39 The sad thing is, is we can't even crack down on corruption and crime in our own country, because it's ran by corruption and crime, and I'm so sorry for the loss of any life so we could have Palm oil when we are able to get it without killing, killing is rarely necessary #carepls
1722 2018-11-30 21:07:39 今日はお休みなのですが、やらなきゃならないことがあり、多分午前中からやらないと…的な感じです
1723 2018-11-30 21:07:12 Alaska has Oil.
1724 2018-11-30 21:06:54 Funny, but that has always been one of the Green Party's goals--reduce foreign oil dependency.
1725 2018-11-30 21:06:53 Didn't Florida ban them together with offshore oil drilling on the same ballot measure?
1726 2018-11-30 21:06:49 Stopped using palm oil yet?
1727 2018-11-30 21:06:22 If some very rich oil Barron has happened to switch on BBC Two tonight, know the boys in the Tangerine shirts need a new owner and we’d love to have your money.
1728 2018-11-30 21:06:13 my boss needs to put this order in for our skin care product cause my skin is DRY as fuck. I need my facial recovery oil. That shit it’s literally liquid gold to me. 
1729 2018-11-30 21:06:11 *buys lots of engine oil and cardboard*
1730 2018-11-30 21:06:11 そうなんですよねー
(笑)
1731 2018-11-30 21:06:06 Oil, oil, oil Oil, oil, oil Oil, oil, oil Oil, oil, oil Oil, oil, oil Oil, oil, oil
1732 2018-11-30 21:06:06 If only people who polluted others and their neighbours were not absolutely selfish turbothrobbers. And if only the desperate stove makers were not a bunch of snake oil salesmen/women.  
1733 2018-11-30 21:06:01 An oil painting can be about something not seen.  Everyone has cameras to take pictures of objects.
1734 2018-11-30 21:05:57 If deforestation continues that threaten orangutan habitats stop buying the palm oil products
1735 2018-11-30 21:05:52 Pouring oil like chachi .

I agree with you, she is playing with grace.

Let haters hate, we are here to support her always 
1736 2018-11-30 21:05:51 I seriously need to hurry and get my oil changed 
1737 2018-11-30 21:05:44 You couldn’t have negotiated a fair price for Canadian Oil? Here you are, taking a victory lap... for what exactly? The tariffs are also still in place. Ya... a real victory you have there.
1738 2018-11-30 21:05:42 Are oil tanker spills that common,,,correct me if I’m wrong but I’ve heavier heard of one anywhere,,,
1739 2018-11-30 21:05:29 And we are now selling oil to Saudi Arabia...
1740 2018-11-30 21:05:16 Obama is retired.
But he’s still Liar in Chief.
Oil, Coal were his arch enemies. 
Now he wants to take credit.
For what, being a liar.
1741 2018-11-30 21:05:14 It is for vanity projects, and to grease palms/oil the cogs for business contracts, and to virtue signal. Just a shame that the wealth that China and India create doesn't enable even fresh water in some places
1742 2018-11-30 21:04:56 優しいからですよ
1743 2018-11-30 21:04:55 Sir I am from your constituency...I gave an exam @Oil_India Kolkata office (regional recruitment).came to your home @Mohishila on Chat Puja... Nobody helped me in this regard.
1744 2018-11-30 21:04:49 any move to keep these resources in the ground would spell the end of ExxonMobil, Russian energy giant Gazprom, the Koch brothers & Putin. It could also bring down many financial institutions that have let the oil & gas sector accrue debt loads to exploit uneconomic resources.”
1745 2018-11-30 21:04:47 I use a particular oil for day to day use that a local lady blends and sells at the farmers markets, but if my hair is really dry I use just about any plant oil, slather it on over night, then wash my hair in the morning.
1746 2018-11-30 21:04:44 By society, you mean the oil companies, gas stations, dealers and legacy automakers?
1747 2018-11-30 21:04:42 I like how oil paint takes like two weeks to dry unless it has the convenience of being on your skin or shirt- then it dries before you notice it and REFUSES to come off
1748 2018-11-30 21:04:42 Where tf you getting your oil changed? Lmao
1749 2018-11-30 21:04:36 Boycotted, but waiting for pipelines and oil to save Calgary is "head-in-sand" foolish. Need municipal and provincial government with vision to diversify. @seanchucalgary is spearheading the anti-prosperity faction!
1750 2018-11-30 21:04:16 This guys oil change was 110$ #LawdHammercy
1751 2018-11-30 21:04:12 Oil
1752 2018-11-30 21:04:07 Just paid $55 to get my oil changed someone teach me how to change it myself bc I’m not okay with this 
1753 2018-11-30 21:04:06 Blood & oil unite.
1754 2018-11-30 21:04:06 Wanting and real life are two different things. In real life global demand for oil & gas projected to increase at least for the next 2 decades. Everyone is using petroleum one way or another in their everyday life. As a consumer I choose not to support a company that is unti AB.
1755 2018-11-30 21:03:55 Just accidentally caused a literal oil spill at the Costco gas station, I’m so quirky 
1756 2018-11-30 21:03:46 Just another of Justin's public relations stunts!  This has no effect while eastern Canada buys Saudi Arabian oil  and sells weapons to Saudi Arabia!  Justin is a hypocrite!
1757 2018-11-30 21:03:37 It should be lubricated with regular oil spills.
1758 2018-11-30 21:03:33 It's still classified as a word. But no, Nigeria is not known for crude oil. We're not even top 5.
1759 2018-11-30 21:03:25 Don’t forget Alberta Oil. The Canadian people have bought you a pipeline. You sound like a kid that didn’t get what they wanted at Xmas. Please.
1760 2018-11-30 21:03:24 There’s a New Hemp CBD OIL in Town!
1761 2018-11-30 21:03:22 Lol thanks mate. The oil will be out soon enough!
1762 2018-11-30 21:03:19 And... Even if you are so anti-science that you grapple with whether climate change is real, it doesn't matter. Ultimately cleaner renewables are going to be cheaper and we should be keeping oil resources sequestered for use by later generations.
1763 2018-11-30 21:03:17 The us doesn’t get much oil from The middle east about 5 % a year, Europe on the other hand yes they do like our Black Sludge pumping through their veins
1764 2018-11-30 21:03:01 Took car to have oil changed. Go into waiting room. TV turned to Fox. Panel is discussing @HuffPost article on Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer (Nero fiddles). I turn TV to Yule Log. Other customer waiting whispers, "thank you." 
Why be bullied by a TV? Turn the damn thing off.
1765 2018-11-30 21:03:00 CANCEL your approval for oil companies to start Seismic Testing & Drilling. If they trigger earthquakes of any size, IT'S ON YOU. Big Oil will tell you they cannot trigger earthquakes & have science. We all know what you think of science, doesn't your gut say NO TESTING/ DRILLING
1766 2018-11-30 21:02:44 Trump blames Alaska quake on not pumping enough oil out of ground.  #AlaskaQuake
1767 2018-11-30 21:02:31 I drive a tiny ass Hyundai. Why does it cost damn near $45 to fill my tank?! Why is my oil changes $70?! I bought a non luxury car because I prefer cheap maintenance. But my pockets gettin hit anyways

1769 2018-11-30 21:02:12 He was PAID to have her back, whether monetarily, or by the exposure that has helped his career. He used her, and now she has to pay Trumps atty fees. Stormy, Avenatti is a snake oil salesman, and he will sell you down the river for publicity. And u need to find the money he took
1770 2018-11-30 21:02:03 If only that were true, The picture is missing the oil refinery making the petrol! I am a petrol head, I have a 3.5 V8 LR, Supercharged Mini Cooper and a 200BHP+ VW Caravelle, but EVs are the future and we should embrace them.
1771 2018-11-30 21:02:02 Anyone got a plug for THC oil?
1772 2018-11-30 21:01:59 We have oil

1774 2018-11-30 21:01:44 is oil of every pearl a good album
1775 2018-11-30 21:01:39 Was that one time in the Bible where Jesus knocked over all the merchants’ tables and started whipping them a “heated gamer moment”?
1776 2018-11-30 21:01:24 But  Alaska has oil, just like Texas.
1777 2018-11-30 21:01:17 Snake Oil Salesman
1778 2018-11-30 21:01:17 Pipeline is safer then rail. The longer pipeline takes the more oil will be shipped by rail. Production wont stop anytime soon. Its essential to our economy
1779 2018-11-30 21:00:44 I wear combat boots for comfort. Don't @me

1782 2018-11-30 21:00:27 Disagree on the high oil prices part, the oil spike happened 7 months into the recession.
1783 2018-11-30 21:00:20 Real question in my mind: 
What happens if US dollar is not standard for oil?
1784 2018-11-30 21:00:10 Because of the (predicted) decline in oil prices, motorists will be better off, even without @PhilipHammondUK 's reckless policy change in the last budget.
1785 2018-11-30 21:00:06 I love watching all these freed leaders smile.  MBS went all in on the Cabal pocket book when he tanked the price of oil after they tried to pin that whole Khashoggi murder on him.  He's playing hardball.  Looks like Putin approves.
1786 2018-11-30 21:00:05 Ideally my look isn't so much "girl next door" as it is "the oil economy runs on the pursuit of me"
1787 2018-11-30 21:00:02 Yup. Oil dying.  Cars shrinking.  Good thing Canada gets decent immigration.
1788 2018-11-30 20:59:59 hey @ the dude in line at the oil change place: screaming “what the fuck is the hold up?” 20 times to the employees isn’t gonna make them move any faster

1791 2018-11-30 20:59:37 well, it doesn't hurt to effectively control the supply of oil and natural gas... (thankfully, we'll always have the Saudi's to periodically boost production and tank the Russian economy;)
1792 2018-11-30 20:59:35 We have oil
1793 2018-11-30 20:59:34 Hey bin Salman. If you want to pay money for killing innocent people. Pay out of your own pocket. Not by reduced oil price upon which our economies. We do not have to carry your mistakes barbarism
1794 2018-11-30 20:59:27 If not for the oil and being a tool and a client state of imperialism, KSA will never be on the #G20. Arabs entered the decline and fragmentation state around AD1000. So it is not #Vision2030. It is more like #Vision1030.
1795 2018-11-30 20:59:26 Australian Pollies BRAG about our Economy of $1.7T bloody Britain Economy is $4T--they have a bit of Oil & Investments in Australia--we have Everything or we did until these 2 Big Parttes SOLD it all-Nationalise fuck Sovereign Risk!!

1800 2018-11-30 20:59:11 China says, "No problem, we'll take gold or oil in payment." The loan and the "dollars" are extinguished.

But they might as well have been called Kismets as "dollars" for all the relationship they ever had to the US dollar. 3/n

1806 2018-11-30 20:58:52 There’s a cost to everything.

Just hoping my UPS package at the crib after this damn oil change
1807 2018-11-30 20:58:46 Forced it in. With warm tea tree oil.
1808 2018-11-30 20:58:43 I almost fell asleep during my profs oil painting demo and I was sitting right next to him nfjmsjdjs 
There's also faculty demo night right after so I might stay a bit later too... 
Then I'll go home shower and crash

That man deserves to wear whatever he wants on his down time and I love him just as madly, even when he wears those awful black socks with those awful awful sandals.
1811 2018-11-30 20:58:13 @OSUBuckeyeClub  where are the alumni sitting at Lucas oil stadium?

1815 2018-11-30 20:57:56 That's what proper sandals are for.  

(Not flip flops, those are the lowest form of footware.)

1823 2018-11-30 20:57:15 @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast
1824 2018-11-30 20:57:03 Oh crude oil is just a word sorry 
It's a compound word
1825 2018-11-30 20:56:47 We're doomed if we continued sucking on the oil and gas hose. Fortunately carbon pricing will begin incentivizing a move away from it.
1826 2018-11-30 20:56:46 I will ride this goddamn oil long to zero if I have to.
1827 2018-11-30 20:56:30 WTI Crude Oil 50.65 bbl, -0.80, -1.6% $USO

1828 2018-11-30 20:56:19 Picture Trump as an oil barrel filled with cement sitting on the deck of the SS GOP. Tie all enablers to this oil barrel. Dump it overboard. GOP, you'll have to start over with non-mobsters, sorry.
1829 2018-11-30 20:56:14 Like I can do this for spring type shi?
1830 2018-11-30 20:55:56 You bet, just filed up for the first time in a while $2.29 gallon. What's not to like unless you're leveraged long oil stocks of course.

1836 2018-11-30 20:55:34 Hey science tweeps, my students are looking to buy some crude oil to do an experiment in lab investigating the effects of oil spills. Does anyone know how to buy crude oil? Seriously!! #oil #globalwarming #Science @Rutgers_Camden
1837 2018-11-30 20:55:20 I suspect Trump won't do to Alaska as he did to Puerto Rico being Alaska is an actual state in the union and the gas and oil pipelines in Alaska along with additional drilling the oil/gas companies are pushing for in the Alaskan wilderness.
1838 2018-11-30 20:55:00 If I see one more tweet about fucking pancakes and motor oil i-sweater-GOT

Small victories at 23, man.
1842 2018-11-30 20:54:39 Hey you have no clue about our economy. You are selfish, we need oil and gas to transition into the future. If we cut oil now we are doomed.  People have  to wake up now it’s our future we are playing with.
1843 2018-11-30 20:54:37 as much as I love shea butter moisturising with oil in the shower is the new wave man flemme

1847 2018-11-30 20:54:17 Yup. Vlad and Salman look nothing alike, speak different languages, are competitors in oil sales, and Russia supports arch enemy, Iran. So, why the high the fives?;
A - common interest in killing enemies;
B - Kompromat/control of @realDonaldTrump; or
C - both of above

1854 2018-11-30 20:53:31 thank u obama i love oil
1855 2018-11-30 20:53:29 Only if you calculate the number of taxpayer paid seat warmers Notley has put on the payroll.  How about all the people now being laid off, due to excessively low oil prices. That affects everybody, cause now these people aren’t spending. Gosh, that’s hard to understand.
1856 2018-11-30 20:53:27 DIPIKA playing good game. No VICTIM Drama. She Speak When NEEDED.I FOUND her more sorted.

1869 2018-11-30 20:52:30 Back in the early 70s scientist said we were heading for a mini ice age,
I dont think any of em  really know whats happening, but in our past the british isles was  tropical, so if we warm up a bit dont that mean we will use less gas/oil?
1870 2018-11-30 20:52:24 Ya, my Dad sold a condo up there and a few years before it was at almost twice what he paid for it. When he sold it was almost break even. It is wrong for the gov to approve oil volumes that can’t be supported by transport infrastructure.
1871 2018-11-30 20:52:22 All energy exporting countries (especially friendly ones) profited in past from USD inflation export and monopoly (above market) oil price.
All energy importing countries had to participate in the USD centric debt based system for lack of alternatives by design.
Euro stepped out.
1872 2018-11-30 20:52:06 there's something really fucking irritating about Iceland putting "no palm oil" stickers on chicken/beef/seafood products. What is it about farmed animals that makes their lives mean less than an orangutans?
1873 2018-11-30 20:52:00 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
1874 2018-11-30 20:51:58 Yeah because all Scots are big drinkers. Plenty of Scots working in the oil industry are your victims #STOPtheLoanCharge

1878 2018-11-30 20:51:45 no, more like the councillors are the oil, and the lamp is all the work they have to do
1879 2018-11-30 20:51:44 IMHO this is just a tactic to delay & obstruct while trying to look like a “nice guy”. 
Who would say No to Canadian Oil

1880 2018-11-30 20:51:40 What is the point of booking an appointment for an oil change if it's still going to take two hours?
1881 2018-11-30 20:51:40 Not an oil company that’s diversifying to increase profits!! Noooooo, a company having multiple cash flows while increasing dividends & profits for share holders!! Stop it!! No bloody way!! Craziness
1882 2018-11-30 20:51:22 Also, for skincare oil cleansers are recommended for oily skin because like dissolves like and overwashing can cause dryness which causes -more- oil production
1883 2018-11-30 20:51:12 Justin Trudeau doesn't want pipelines, he hates Alberta and the oil industry! Judge him by his actions not his words. If Trudeau is re-elected it would be a disaster for Alberta and Canada!
1884 2018-11-30 20:51:10 trump cant stop all jobs from being lost in every sector, but overall he has improved jobs accross the country in every sector. trump saved the coal industry which obama nearly destroyed! he helped the oil and gas industry to the point that we are almost energy independent
1885 2018-11-30 20:51:08 But he’ll go down on Big Pharma and Big Oil.
1886 2018-11-30 20:51:07 Yeah, right!  It’s the PC’s failed policies, reckless spending and lack of vision to save for the inevitable day oil demand & prices drop.
1887 2018-11-30 20:51:03 So in class I learned today that oil and gasoline is in fact not made from dinosaurs but dead algae and plankton only. I’m a sophomore in PETROLEUM engineering. What the heck
1888 2018-11-30 20:50:52 I understand that, but if we stop buying Saudi oil then the east would have plenty of product demand. It would require expansion at suncor/syncrude etc. but they’d be more than happy to produce more if they could move the product
1889 2018-11-30 20:50:36 Me: *frying frijole tacos*
Bridgitte: Shit the oil just popped and hit me on the nose! See if I had my nose job it would’ve just gotten me on the cheek
1890 2018-11-30 20:50:28 It's not like Alaska doesn't have money. Not with all the oil royalties.

1892 2018-11-30 20:50:10 Why do we need oil & gas
1893 2018-11-30 20:50:09 Please clarify. You indicated your roads are polluted and that it was caused by oil and gas companies.
1894 2018-11-30 20:49:53 Because Alaska is and has almost always been a red state plus I bet it has something to do with the oil there
1895 2018-11-30 20:49:50 FYI: Do you know that 70% of the National budget is used to pay Salary ???

We all know what happens in ministries, Gossips and early closure etc

Have you asked yourself what would happen if the Oil drys up today ??? 

A Vote for Buhari is a Vote for your Future wallahi.
1896 2018-11-30 20:49:47 They use for their dictatorships, that West has on the needle. 
On their needle of oil and gas. And West as an drug addicted forgives all their drug dealer his aggression and crimes.
1897 2018-11-30 20:49:40 During this week’s filming, I’ve seen the process of making bio-diesel. From raw ingredients (used cooking oil, fat, grease, tallow) entering the plant, being processed, to tank-farms of finished product. A thoroughly interesting, if not slightly smelly process #videoproduction
1898 2018-11-30 20:49:23 This rain need to stop. I need a oil change and car wash
1899 2018-11-30 20:49:22 Four simple steps, but they must be done in tandom for it to work. Charge US mfg, & supply-chain & tech co's operating offshore 34% flat tax; subsidize US coal & steel co's -instead of oil & auto co's; enforce antitrust & securities laws; & objective tariffs that protect US mfg

1906 2018-11-30 20:48:44 Heads Up !#Waterprotectors #BlackSnakeKillaz #Environmental orgs. I just got added to a list from our enemy @ScottLauermann. He has lots of lists with oil industry members.
1907 2018-11-30 20:48:35 if crown prince cut oil off that will  destroy the world economy and you and the others will be fired 

Don't talk just for the sake of talking
1908 2018-11-30 20:48:33 ... One would expect that to do so, he should first show the  rest of the world 
that as the  President, he is able to make the oil industry in his own country agree on a price target.
1909 2018-11-30 20:48:12 Isn't there more money in grassroot groups for oil and coal?
1910 2018-11-30 20:47:54 What alternative universe are you living in?? He doubled the debt to $20 Trillion. He put so many new regulations in place it was hard to even start a business. He never approved any oil pipelines, once he left office we now have a booming economy in oil.
1911 2018-11-30 20:47:53 So a natural distaster happens in a place with oil and the dodgy haired one responds immediately. Multiple other places and he either doesn't, or takes ages to say something.

Not surprising at all.
1912 2018-11-30 20:47:47 time for more seismic drilling for oil?
1913 2018-11-30 20:47:46 Yes, of course!! An Oil company that doesn’t want to make money producing oil!! Duhhhhhh

1937 2018-11-30 20:46:10 Well our communities depend on our beaches, we shouldn’t be drilling off our coast, we should be protecting it! Do the right thing and stand up to the oil industry and their greed! Put people over profit!

1945 2018-11-30 20:45:41 Well, Socialism isn't what caused the disaster, oil prices
1946 2018-11-30 20:45:20 Nope. This is environmental affront. So much plastic for just two biscuits. 
Have you promised not to use palm oil? Have you decreased sugar?

1948 2018-11-30 20:45:09 I got an oil change done today by myself. (I usually bring a guy friend or my man but nobody was available) I paid 95 fucking dollars. For AN OIL CHANGE

Well I’m 95% sure that I got PLAYED
1949 2018-11-30 20:45:06 The Conservatives are trying to make an issue of a clause in Bill C-69. It offends the sensibilities of those who view oil (and mining) as the last refuge of manly men.

1955 2018-11-30 20:44:39 Realization: Companies like Ford and GM are focusing on SUVs and trucks because of this scenario:

1. Electric cars are getting cheaper 
2. Oil companies must continue to lower the price per barrel to compete with electric. 
3. Cheap gas will increase demand for trucks and SUVs.
1956 2018-11-30 20:44:37 What an ignorant comment. Heavy oil currently DOES sell for a premium, you just need to be able to get it to a place like the US gulf coast.

1970 2018-11-30 20:43:29 Can we please focus on more important issues like the failing oil and automotive industries, our strained relationship with the US, the immoral and unethical signing of the UN migration pact, and the raw sewage being dumped into our waterways?

1983 2018-11-30 20:42:55 Forgot to take the power of the greedy oil companies into consideration.

2000 2018-11-30 20:40:45 Exactly. We can feed the entire world on plants 4x over but keep this disgusting industry alive “because jobs” just like keep the oil industry around “because jobs” jobs won’t matter when our planet can’t sustain life anymore.

2002 2018-11-30 20:40:34 Relying on foreign oil is not good either. Sure, I'd rather just cut off all the need for fossil fuels, but it doesn't work that way. These topics aren't diametrically opposed, you can reduce emmissions while using more American oil.

2005 2018-11-30 20:40:24 #OPEC is going to need to cut 2M b/d if it wants to move prices. To do that, the cartel has to cede market share to US producers. So all things considered, there is an upside to the current level of oil prices. Though I'm sure most OPEC members are unhappy. #OOTT

2010 2018-11-30 20:40:19 Yup. Vlad and Salman look nothing alike, speak different languages, are competitors in oil sales, and Russia supports arch enemy, Iran. So, why the high the fives?;
A - common interest in killing enemies;

2014 2018-11-30 20:40:00 Seismic testing leads to offshore drilling, which can cause environmental disasters like #DeepwaterHorizon resulting in millions of gallons of oil spilling into our waters tarnishing marine life and coastal communities.
2015 2018-11-30 20:39:51 This is pure greed.  We are already pretty much self-reliant.  Has Trump invested in oil?  Is he getting a kick back? Are these companies who will own the drilling stations our allies or his?

2024 2018-11-30 20:38:59 That's talking about the trade uncertainty around tariffs and NAFTA. I'll openly admit and I've said it before investment in our oil is down, but overall foreign investment is healthy. And those trade concerns are mostly fixed with the new trade deal.
2025 2018-11-30 20:38:54 Ohhhh just have a swig! If it’s oil then it still has a purpose x 
2026 2018-11-30 20:38:48 Alright you know better than economists & investors. GM just shut down 5 plants to focus on electric cars & Royal Dutch Shell spends more money on renewable energy than on oil because YOU'RE right. Cool. I'll let you manage my portfolio.

2049 2018-11-30 20:36:53 Do you have oil 
2050 2018-11-30 20:36:50 blaming Obama for racism?  
"Obamacare is the gateway drug"! 
"Obamacare jacked up rates" << WRONG
"Medicare's going broke" << WRONG
Obama was against oil production << WRONG

maybe you should grow your mustache back, Stossel?
2051 2018-11-30 20:36:44 Twitter is ruining my life I had a dream I went to ihop and ordered pancakes and I bit into CARDBOARD AND MOTOR OIL
2052 2018-11-30 20:36:37 I find that hard to believe considering the sale of electric vehicles is still riding an exponential increase despite incentives being removed. Companies like audi and volvo are now in the process of creating entire lines of EVs. And while oil may be cheap now that won’t last.
2053 2018-11-30 20:36:35 @repkihuen @SenDeanHeller @SenCortezMasto: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast
2054 2018-11-30 20:36:35 Psssssst, what about the steel tarrifs? Alberta oil? Aerospace? Auto Sector? THE MOST IMPORTANT STUFF!!!
2055 2018-11-30 20:36:33 Other than our energy sector investment is alive and well in Canada and oil worldwide is taking a hit not just in Alberta.
2056 2018-11-30 20:36:30 we had this.  now let’s see oil go up.
2057 2018-11-30 20:36:30 Guess the BP gulf spill didn’t mean anything to you? Oil is finite. Solar & other renewables are infinite. Water, wind, solar... always available. Even on cloudy days.
2058 2018-11-30 20:36:26 Oil and water

2062 2018-11-30 20:35:56 Wasn't Obama just bragging about how much more oil was being drilled under his watch?
2063 2018-11-30 20:35:51 An oil change doesn't take this long
2064 2018-11-30 20:35:41 I LOVE cooking and watching recipe videos, but if a video starts with unseasoned chicken in a pan w only a little olive oil........Im not watching anymore bc I already know it’s not gonna be good.
2065 2018-11-30 20:35:38 @BTP just seen three youngsters with bikes far too big for them, with bike oil all over hands - northbound on metro tube line
2066 2018-11-30 20:35:03 Neither have I. I must pop in now. Can't stand anything with 'Palm Oil'
2067 2018-11-30 20:35:02 Waiting for an oil change is like watching paint dry what the fuck they be doing back there ?
2068 2018-11-30 20:35:02 If they’d have used oil money they would have got away with it!
2069 2018-11-30 20:35:01 Well, Vlad and Salman look nothing alike, speak different languages, are competitors in oil sales, and Russian supports arch enemy, Iran. So, why the high the fives?;
A - common interest in killing enemies;
B - Kompromat/control of @realDonaldTrump; or
C - both of above
2070 2018-11-30 20:34:59 Well.... you can always give up your use of oil and set an example for everyone to go cold turkey before we have a zero carbon infrastructure in place.
2071 2018-11-30 20:34:41 No one wants to separate. If Alberta does, they can go ahead. Then they will have more than oil and taxes to complain about!
2072 2018-11-30 20:34:36 Sometimes it says on the oil cap.
2073 2018-11-30 20:34:24 I remember that. It’s so four years ago. Much has happened since. Like those imaginary oil fields appearing for a start. I think that independence supporters are the majority now. There’s only one way to find out.
2074 2018-11-30 20:34:24 A fish oil capsule exploded in my purse so now everything smells like fish and I’m gonna throw up
2075 2018-11-30 20:34:20 vape oil. Please I must see
2076 2018-11-30 20:34:18 You should picked career better.  Be dumb oil field pumper like me.   No one miss you.  Well less u blow up!  Oh ya then its a big deal all sudden !
2077 2018-11-30 20:34:14 going to the club while in a relationship is like oil and water
2078 2018-11-30 20:34:07 All deals ...... except those where they sell oil to us. Those deals will remain in place!
2079 2018-11-30 20:34:03 They could be drilling for oil in that areas.
2080 2018-11-30 20:34:02 The west had a concrete plan for SSA  while the we’re ousting gadafi from Libya .As far as 1912, the west had interest on Africa’s oil .so here is my question , can Sub Saharan Africa ever experience peace.?
2081 2018-11-30 20:34:01 After chemist Roger Adams first extracted CBD in the 1940s, research continued well into the 1960s. That's when tests were completed on primates and researchers were able to produce the first CBD oil intended for therapeutic use. British Pharmacopoeia was the first to release it
2082 2018-11-30 20:33:54 Good thing cannabis oil fits in gel caps
2083 2018-11-30 20:33:52 Seriously Lisa ... are you really going to go there?  All you have to do is google OIL WORKERS and the SEX TRADE and there are literally dozens of articles, studies, and reports on it. If you don't think underage girls or human trafficking, then you're being purposely obtuse.

500g cooked farfalle pasta, 75ml extra virgin olive oil, 2 cloves of garlic, crushed, 1 chilli crushed, Saltnpepper, 250g sprouts finely sliced, Parmesan cheese shaved. Cook in usual manner
2085 2018-11-30 20:32:59 When's the last time you criticized an environmentalist chained to a tree? How about protesters who obstruct someone trying to build an oil pipeline? How would you rate yourself on consistency?
2086 2018-11-30 20:32:55 The future? Oil demand is increasing!! If you want to live a quality of life like Mexico it takes 100,000,000bbl of oil a year.
AB had no problems competing before & now your saying it isn’t? You do realize we can upgrade to any spec!  get it out & it solve that  problem

2088 2018-11-30 20:32:53 DMV girls invented the no grease / no oil sheen policy for blowouts.

2091 2018-11-30 20:32:50 A 15 to 25 percent cash donation by oil centric tax-payers to subsidize the purchase of solar panels make sense to them as well. Not sure how we got this silly.
2092 2018-11-30 20:32:36 Dear WH, if you look closely you'll find that the protections in NAFTA that forced Canada to sell our crude oil to US refineries at the same price we sold it to our own refineries wasn't covered in NAFTA 2.0.  Guess you missed the smug look on Justin's face
2093 2018-11-30 20:32:33 Nothing wrong promoting wind power -- but I get the sense someone is trying to distract from issues like the $260-billion it will cost to cleanup the unregulated mess left behind by the broader Alberta oil industry.
2094 2018-11-30 20:32:33 Schools hard enough with powers then throw in someone without ... Oil and water.. more like Hydraulic acid and water BOOM!! What did Kaleb say " They don't want us around them " 
2095 2018-11-30 20:32:32 MTM oil if I remember correctly...
2096 2018-11-30 20:32:26 It’s made from the chickpeas. Not hummus. Who would want a milkshake that tastes like
Garlic, lemon and olive oil?
2097 2018-11-30 20:32:18 No, my view is a bit different.
There are many views and explanations like the role of oil, I am also not so gold centered. Already in 1960s, an increase in the price of gold was ruled out - mainly for political reasons...." Neither one wants the system to collapse.
2098 2018-11-30 20:32:16 I agree with you, what oil companies are doing to our planet is definitely eco-terrorism. How many people will die due to these oil companies?
2099 2018-11-30 20:32:06 You credit the lube for the shine? ;) I tell you a truth, it's the same shit like every other silicone oil based on dimethicone. It's like showing a car and credit the gas in it. car: BMW M5, gas: Shell :)
2100 2018-11-30 20:32:01 It’s funny I live in Fort Mcmurray and everyone I meet wants to sell there house but can’t.  If we see anymore downturn in the oil and gas industry this is truly going to be the biggest economic disaster in Canadian history.  Rumours of over 300 people on the brink of bankruptcy
2101 2018-11-30 20:32:01 When one stupid tweets.
What do u know about any of them?
Have ever been in any of the tow countries. These leaders control oil price so idiots like u don’t ride his brother donkey again.
What u enjoy now is grace for them.
2102 2018-11-30 20:31:52 You know what would be even better.... if the gas in those tanks was from Canada and not foreign imported oil! #supportcanadienoil
2103 2018-11-30 20:31:35 5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;
You anoint my head with oil;

All the days of my life;
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord
Forever.

2104 2018-11-30 20:31:33 What about giving a "massive" relief of PKR 2/- to consumers on domestic POL prices vis-à-vis USD 30/BBL reduction in global oil prices?
2105 2018-11-30 20:31:23 I prefer storng relationship with Russia than US cuz they are stable US change their positions and sometimes #fakenews lead US SA made deals worth trillions of dollars with US SA helped the US economy not to collapse in1970s when Saudis supported the dollar by oil

2110 2018-11-30 20:30:29 Anyone use CBD oil or pills for pain relief ?
2111 2018-11-30 20:30:28 SO Nutella is now on sustainable palm oil and therefore is a good egg so you can buy ALL OF IT ALL THE TIME
2112 2018-11-30 20:30:27 Well, Vlad and Salman look nothing alike, speak different languages, are competitors in oil sales, and Russian supports arch enemy, Iran. So, why the high the fives?;
A - common interest in killing enemies;
B - Kompromat/control of @realDonaldTrump; or
C - both of above
2113 2018-11-30 20:30:24 They sound like 19th century snake oil salesmen “it’s the biggest product in Europe”
2114 2018-11-30 20:30:24 I have to change my oil and do hella homework fuck dude
2115 2018-11-30 20:30:22 Yeah...we drill oil...so..
2116 2018-11-30 20:30:17 Big profiteering oil deals!! How to stop all this where the electric cars?? And no more influences of Suadi Arabia or Moscow!! This is why big oil is into our public lawmaking and get rid of Citizens United with campaign reform that gets out the bribing money!
2117 2018-11-30 20:30:15 Lol too late to cry when the head is cut off
2118 2018-11-30 20:30:09 WEIRD FACT OF THE DAY: Every year 16 million gallons of oil runs off pavement into streams, rivers, and eventually, oceans in the United States. This is more oil than was spilled by the Exxon Valdez.
2119 2018-11-30 20:30:08 Mind you, we were at the bottom of League 2 before we became Oil FC so they probably will.
2120 2018-11-30 20:29:36 He really is a snake oil salesman of a dangerous philosophy, veiled in Peterson's growing cult of personality. It's amazing people still listen to him.
2121 2018-11-30 20:29:33 Justin,  we got to get that oil flowing through that pipe line!

2131 2018-11-30 20:28:36 Germany buys oil from Russia.
2132 2018-11-30 20:28:33 I don't really trade oil much.....but hate has nothing to do with it.  I just don't see where he deserves the credit.  And I didn't vote for Obama either.
2133 2018-11-30 20:28:29 You do live in a province/country driven by the oil sands, so they have some validity to their points. Not the yelling though.
2134 2018-11-30 20:28:20 Don't you think Rachel should put it on the screen behind her, a daily update on a Miracle turning back Global warming?

Tucker pulling off the gloves on Koch Bros paid denialist, not scientist and shreds every piece of evidence they used to prove oil is good...   
2135 2018-11-30 20:28:07 Ever the hyperbolic snake oil salesman. You're wearing thin.
2136 2018-11-30 20:28:06 LOL ... snake oil salesman.
2137 2018-11-30 20:28:05 And then he’s gonna open up protected land for oil
2138 2018-11-30 20:28:04 Forgot all the work i did while on that thc oil the other night. Brandon tryna kill me
2139 2018-11-30 20:27:59 I oppose nazis. I oppose expansion by war. I oppose Mafia methods on the internation stage, I oppose wars for oil and lies about WMDs, & babies thrown from incubators. This list goes on. By the way ALL gas attacks in Syria have been by terrorists creating false flag incidents.
2140 2018-11-30 20:27:58 Guys, if you have your earlobe stretched DON'T FORGET to hydrate them at least 1x/day with jojoba oil, especially with the cold weather ♡
2141 2018-11-30 20:27:55 Imagine coming home  to your chubby wife who smells like deep-frying oil
2142 2018-11-30 20:27:50 Hold on to faith sweetheart. Usually when the doctors cannot diagnose the problem it turns out that the problem is spiritual. Go to the elders of your church and ask for anointing with oil you will recover says the word of God.
2143 2018-11-30 20:27:47 If you are not a deck ape then you only get oil fire training - if you are a deck ape then you get a lot of other training - I was an electronic warfare tech so only oil fire.
2144 2018-11-30 20:27:40 DUDE GEDTLEBELLZ LIDERALLY ENKRUZTED WID WEED AND DUNKED IN MCT OIL AND DROWN OFF BUILDIGNZ FEAR FACTOR STYLE :D
2145 2018-11-30 20:27:23 Damn, a lot of ppl don't mind him selling the citizens out to oil. Another sad day for the country.
2146 2018-11-30 20:27:19 Obama took oil co side at standing rock,  ampt up off shore drilling and ran pipelines thru every state.
2147 2018-11-30 20:27:11 Our economy is booming, we’re producing oil like crazy, we have more jobs than people to fill them, we’ve renegotiated advantageous trade deals, middle class made a comeback, we get our hostages and MIAs back.
Its so good People are trying to break IN to our nation. Try Again
2148 2018-11-30 20:27:09 Yes , we are. 
We love to talk and take pride in our values, but at the same time we love to sell them for oil and deals
2149 2018-11-30 20:26:50 Trump wants seismic testing in the Atlantic Ocean for oil testing. This testing will beach more whales and dolphins   @NewYorkStateAG @SenFeinstein @RepAdamSchiff @KamalaHarris @RonWyden @SenatorTomUdall @SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @SenWarren @SenatorDurbin @SenBooker
2150 2018-11-30 20:26:48 But i have no oil sooo dreams deffered
2151 2018-11-30 20:26:39 Yes, in tandem with establishing a "New Green Deal". But we'd have to rebuild/modernize our cities fist to reduce gas/oil & consumer consumption dependencies.
2152 2018-11-30 20:26:35 What big oil clown shill you are why would anyone vote for  a corporate lackey?
2153 2018-11-30 20:26:26 Gotta get a oil change today
2154 2018-11-30 20:26:24 I see what you mean because he; hasn’t implemented tax reform, improved the economy, improved VA healthcare, created prison reform, reduced prescription drug costs, reduced burdensome regulations on corporations or gotten rid of the regulations on the oil pipeline...TURN OFF MSM!
2155 2018-11-30 20:26:23 Dude I don't know how many times I have to say "in the future". And yes, it's about global supply and demand. Saudi, Norwegian & Permian oil is cheaper to extract than oil sands oil. Alberta oil is too expensive. Do you read stuff or do you just tweet what you hope is true?
2156 2018-11-30 20:26:20 Obama is verifying that he is a Repub that  sold the citizens out to the banks, oil, foreign interests.. for gold. If that's something to be proud of you need to check out the Repubs.
2157 2018-11-30 20:26:20 I think he does because they have a lot of oil
2158 2018-11-30 20:26:18 Hate to come across as negative but your tweet confirms how ill informed you and the rest of your fellow PC MPPs are regarding oil pricing. Those who blindly believe PC’s have affected oil pricing have been “Forded”, aka out of touch with reality. #onpoli.
2159 2018-11-30 20:26:18 Because of this I’m unhaving 
2160 2018-11-30 20:26:17 When I had mine, I did a couple times, but I preferred to use oil
2161 2018-11-30 20:26:12 Is the shell of the crashed Piper PA-28R, registration G-AZRV still at Compton Abbas? My grandad used to own it and unfortunately had to sell it when he had a heart attack flying it back from Ireland. Subsequent owners had an unfortunate accident when the oil emptied after TO
2162 2018-11-30 20:26:08 You apparently aren't aware that the Puget Sound gets its oil via tankers and oil-by-rail and replacing that with pipelines results in a wash with the big difference being the TMX tankers will be better regulated and thus safer than the existing tankers entering US waters.
2163 2018-11-30 20:26:07 So far this evening I’ve spilt beer all over the living floor and hot oil all over my left hand. I daren’t go near the bleach.
2164 2018-11-30 20:26:05 me vs. acknowledging the light in my car telling me to change my oil
2165 2018-11-30 20:25:46 @IvankaTrump @GretaThunberg Oil companies work hard to spread doubts about climate change so be careful that they do and say. Even climate researchers are severely affected by climate deniers
2166 2018-11-30 20:25:44 We will use ointment, Ori or coconut oil to heal the cane marks. All day everyday.
2167 2018-11-30 20:25:30 Makes sense!

Will remember that next time I need conceptual ammunition for one of my technically deficient & genuinely awful oil paintings.

"Well actually, Goethe once said..."
2168 2018-11-30 20:25:25 Kick them of off SWIFT. Let them eat their oil.
2169 2018-11-30 20:25:18 He just stated that 2008 was primarily caused by high oil prices and that neoliberal policies contributed to the growing household debt.
2170 2018-11-30 20:25:11 I love the place I get my oil changed. I’m in and out in 15 min
2171 2018-11-30 20:25:07 I suppose it's like a pharmaceutical company deciding to sell the snake oil salesman's tonic because people want it, they'll pay money for it, and it comes in a bottle that makes it look like real medicine. Health is all in your mind anyway, right?
2172 2018-11-30 20:25:03 My head is drenched in castor oil and I’m ready to take on the world 
2173 2018-11-30 20:24:55 @FresnoBee Today's Hemp Story...Rodriguez:  About time Hemp being
considered for the U.S.  fiber, seed, oil.....Hemp last forever but bad for
American business as said time and time again...Tired of clothes that
disengrate after 4th washing....Good job RR....
2174 2018-11-30 20:24:51 Very good question @MallikarjunINC , but the money which you are talking is mainly utilised to pay back the loan which your government took for 10 years.... Mainly when crude oil rate was 100+ , for giving subsidiary oil to Indians, your government took huge loan. Facts check !
2175 2018-11-30 20:24:50 Oil is good for rust.
2176 2018-11-30 20:24:47 I can't wait until next week when you start spouting off that all the oil production caused the quake and that the state was at fault. Fugging idiot.
2177 2018-11-30 20:24:45 Biggest would be damage to oil pipeline, but they’ve shut it down to check. Haven’t heard about damaged gas lines yet but lot of them in southcentral.
2178 2018-11-30 20:24:38 $PDS we don't even care about the price of oil
2179 2018-11-30 20:24:32 It's unfathomable, we are not using a free energy source, that has absolutely no impact to the environment, over burning oil, a substance that dramatically impacts the eviorment. If that isn't a perfect example of overwhelming stupidity, one doesn't exist.
2180 2018-11-30 20:24:32 "...our North Sea gas and oil". Really? #KeepItInTheGround
2181 2018-11-30 20:24:31 Putin's smellin' oil.
2182 2018-11-30 20:24:30 Not sure what you're talking about. I went through Navy firefighter training it was not oil fire specific. But I'm sure you wouldn't understand that.
2183 2018-11-30 20:24:30 I wanna get my mom some cbd oil drops for xmas but I need someone that's gon hook me up 
2184 2018-11-30 20:24:22 I once fucked using coconut oil for like massage ¿ and well now I can’t properly treat my fucking hair and lips without getting horny and all I hate this shit so much uuGH
2185 2018-11-30 20:24:09 Current: Cloudy with regular tweets; 38% chance Donald Trump wrote this himself.

Tweet Forecast: Heard.... Bruce Ohr and his relationship with China is allowing oil to go to war with many more companies paying out Tax Cut Bill.
2186 2018-11-30 20:24:06 So many good Aussie bands! Midnight Oil is obviously a classic. What to say about The Easybeats, AC/DC, Air Supply, Radio Birdman to mention a few
2187 2018-11-30 20:24:06 I think Canada needs to build its own fucking oil processing plant.
2188 2018-11-30 20:23:56 @bottinifuel  However, the 
service team is unwilling to honor this commitment. 

I am writing you to ask for your assistance in scheduling the free annual oil tuneup.
2189 2018-11-30 20:23:55 Soon they will sell oil in rubles
2190 2018-11-30 20:23:49 Think that's what they thought my baby oil was 
2191 2018-11-30 20:23:42 I’m 9,000 miles over on an oil change an I ain’t even worried, that’s how carefree I am now
2192 2018-11-30 20:23:38 Only cause there is oil in Alaska. Or else, it’s a drop shipment of Bounty....
2193 2018-11-30 20:23:35 Kristie to her car: “okay honey I know I need an oil change”
2194 2018-11-30 20:23:31 That is electrical propel then who will buy our fossil oil. And whose country has the capacity to produce the required world Bio fuel to run the technology it is not possible can't we ask question when a carrot is triwn to Africa rather we accept every impossibility
2195 2018-11-30 20:23:30 step five: moisturize! of course we all know why moisturizing is important. your skin always needs moisture! put this on every morning and night. awesome moisturizers are benton snail bee high content steam cream or the jojoba oil.
2196 2018-11-30 20:23:29 Order some Olbas oil from Amazon, it's great.
2197 2018-11-30 20:23:26 Make una fly go Lagos then fly back to PH next day as per oil money gang
2198 2018-11-30 20:23:24 Oh ok I get you. Oil sands then.
2199 2018-11-30 20:23:24 Anyway - you do realize I was talking about leadership and not about oil specifically. Feel free to take this off my thread. (BTW what is Vancouver island doing about their sewage dumping and transport of landfill to BC inland via boat?)
2200 2018-11-30 20:23:20 Meanwhile, Saudis fund Daesh and al-Qaeda, and spread Wahhabism far and wide. But hey, cheap oil, amirite?
2201 2018-11-30 20:23:01 Getting an oil change rn and of course the guy who’s helping me is so so so cute and I didn’t even know how to open my hood 
2202 2018-11-30 20:22:58 I also feel like the oil industry is bigger in Houston than in Dallas.

Really though I think Dallas and Houston are pretty similar to each other, especially compared to the other cities in Texas.
2203 2018-11-30 20:22:55 *cause you’re white and there’s oil there
2204 2018-11-30 20:22:46 Obama is now, was then and will always be full of it, and I don't mean oil!!!
2205 2018-11-30 20:22:41 The difference between GM & Alta oil issues well described by A. Coyne, w/ Ont. problem the legacy of gov’t actions in areas where it shouldn’t, w/ subsidies to auto to stay larger than by mkt forces alone; Alta, the failure by gov’t to act when it should to get pipelines built.
2206 2018-11-30 20:22:41 Oil price? and next year budget projections:-D
2207 2018-11-30 20:22:36 The moment someone labels oil sand as tar sand they lose all credibility.
2208 2018-11-30 20:22:28 Oil fires not brush fires big difference but you wouldn't understand that I am sure!
2209 2018-11-30 20:22:28 gonna try glucosamine + fish oil supplements, maybe my body will stop trying to fall apart now
2210 2018-11-30 20:22:22 I could finally be debt free with about  $100 to $150 left over to get myself or my girl something nice maybe try out some cbd oil I keep hearing about
2211 2018-11-30 20:22:21 You don’t care about Alaska Alaska is our last great wildlife reserve & like Palin, her secessionist husband & reality stars for the wrong reasons children, all you see is oil and animals to kill
2212 2018-11-30 20:22:17 He forgot to put that in his campaign slogan"Hope, change, more oil, higher stock prices"
2213 2018-11-30 20:22:12 There's three reasons...oil, money, and oil money.
2214 2018-11-30 20:22:11 currently making tilapia, i’m so scared of the oil :(((
2215 2018-11-30 20:22:10 4 jobs middle class?goodness don’t insult CDNS or pretend U have a shred of decency or care The oil & gas industry is dying the auto sector is starting to die U sign a FREE TRADE DEALThat excludes major sector steelaluminum U screw dairy Shake your head this is good?What a joke!
2216 2018-11-30 20:22:10 Low prices will not last long, we will see a recovery later this year. And oil is likely to become even more expensive, companies are not investing heavily in both extraction and refining for fear of a drop in demand. But we still do not have the technology for that.

2218 2018-11-30 20:22:03 oh you mean THOSE people, i'll go to war against them any day

for a sec i thought you had been watching me arrange my private stores of clove oil and was like hmm upsetting that jess is coming for me personally
2219 2018-11-30 20:21:59 In the old West, he’d been the perfect snake oil salesman.
2220 2018-11-30 20:21:53 Absolutely agree. I have been a daily dry leaf smoker for 20+ years and this year I switched to exclusively smoking via vape (dry leaf and oil) and can tell you my lung capacity hasn’t been this good in oh...about 20+ years. Now if that ain’t scientific I’m not sure what is. 
2221 2018-11-30 20:21:53 Take away demand, don't use oil.
2222 2018-11-30 20:21:50 Price on pollution.. Price on production.... How's the oil spill going??? How come you don't care about Canada's ocean coast on the east coast?   Why are you ignoring the oil spill?   Don't really care?   Hmmmmm
2223 2018-11-30 20:21:40 Maybe its mean of me to be so amused about it, but the guy at the oil change place I've been going to lately hates my car
my car giving other people a hard time
2224 2018-11-30 20:21:40 Oil prices -- in USD

WTI Crude • $50.65 -0.80 -1.55%

2225 2018-11-30 20:21:33 Have you checked into Whitaker's background.  Snake oil refused to be  marketed/sold by him.....
2226 2018-11-30 20:21:31 yah, NO.  Actually we subsidize the hell out of oil, not only directly, but through our foreign policy.  I don't think you have a very clear picture of what our government actually does, or who it's done for.
2227 2018-11-30 20:21:23 News:  “Is Texas ready for bullet trains?”

Big Oil: “No.  It will kill armadillo migration patterns.”  

Normal People: “Armadillos don’t migra...”

Oil Employees:  “THOSE POOR ARMADILLOS!  DONT BUILD TRAINS!”
2228 2018-11-30 20:21:12 @citynewsyeg  It should be the responsibility of the Govt in situations like this where large scale transitions occur to not only provide workers social support, retraining, but to stimulate the building of new local economic business. For the auto & oil workers effected.
2229 2018-11-30 20:21:12 I think the reason for their heterodox beliefs is that shale oil companies are taking away market share
2230 2018-11-30 20:21:05 Christians have wonderful sex.. with our spouses. As a matter of fact I think the good Lord was really generous when he thought it up. It could have been boring and mechanical like changing the oil in your car. 
Thanks God!
2231 2018-11-30 20:21:03 Oil took a nose dive in price recently. Hopefully it stays there. 50 a barrel.
2232 2018-11-30 20:20:57 はいー♪
2233 2018-11-30 20:20:44 SASOL explores and produces crude oil from Gabon.. its refined in South Africa. There was a time when we could have used their fuel only as there was plenty. They exported it... why? Foreign exchange that’s why.....
2234 2018-11-30 20:20:43 But the strange part is they didn't renogotiate the entire NAFTA agreement, and in his rush to get "USMCA" signed he skipped over that parts from NAFTA that were not included in "USMCA' are not grandfathered in. Wave bye bye to cheap oil from Canada.
2235 2018-11-30 20:20:24 Stability in the oil industry? The automotive industry? Strengthening the now out-of-work former middle class? When did you smoke a joint last?
2236 2018-11-30 20:20:22 Yeah that will never happen.  Though it must be said big oil companies like ExxonMobil are warming to a carbon tax.
2237 2018-11-30 20:20:17 @RepMcGovern @SenMarkey @SenWarren: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast
2238 2018-11-30 20:20:14 My mama finally got the oil changed in my car, but now it’s hard getting the insurance money from her. If my Honda wasn’t on the same policy, I wouldn’t pay it.
2239 2018-11-30 20:20:10 Lush stores say stop pipelines. Canada loses 80 Million a day & East Canada uses Oil/Gas from Murderous Saudi Shieks who treat women & girls like crap. BC’s now building a1200 km pipeline to their new Kitamat Tanker Terminal.
Buy Lush ladies & say yes to Saudi Sheiks & BC Tankers
2240 2018-11-30 20:20:00 idk what i’m gonna do if me and my ex stop being friends because he always make sure i get my oil changed 
2241 2018-11-30 20:19:48 So to save the environment you want to give money to suadi arabia? To save the possibility of animals not being covered with oil you will fund humans bombed and starving. You would fund a man that throws people of buildings for being gay? Wtf MA
2242 2018-11-30 20:19:47 what do you know about Oil and Gas industry except for transfer payments from Alberta in the billions to prop up your lifestyle in Montreal?
2243 2018-11-30 20:19:47 Cos you hv 
2244 2018-11-30 20:19:40 I like to get in my joggers and then take my face off.  I've stopped using makeup wipes and use Ponds cleansing balm, which is the bomb.  Then argan oil for night.
2245 2018-11-30 20:19:39 I’m like an oil tycoon, but for twitter followers #economics
2246 2018-11-30 20:19:39 We as a country ruled been like Switzerland and Norway out.  They both pay a fortune to the EU have to comply with almost everything and get no say in regulation or rules.  Norway also has shite loads of oil and has managed that wealth in a far superior manner to us.
2247 2018-11-30 20:19:37 This is a gas and oil lobbyist account
2248 2018-11-30 20:19:30 Screw the big banks that is using your money to invest in oil and helping to destroy are inviornment, go to credit unions, REUSABLE ENTERGY NOW
2249 2018-11-30 20:19:29 @reprooney @marcorubio: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast
2250 2018-11-30 20:19:28 Garlic oil.
2251 2018-11-30 20:19:27 He told Putin that he’s going to return Alaska to Russia and pay for all the oil we extracted.
2252 2018-11-30 20:19:13 Lol why me? 
2253 2018-11-30 20:19:07 First thoughts are Oil on water maybe ... or  animal’s people ?
2254 2018-11-30 20:19:05 Olbas oil at the ready 
2255 2018-11-30 20:19:05 Crude Oil and other Mineral resources.
2256 2018-11-30 20:18:56 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
2257 2018-11-30 20:18:53 How are you still getting RTs for saying motor oil?!
2258 2018-11-30 20:18:52 Unfortunately Alberta is run by big oil, if you want to improve your social and economic situation try going greener. The future isn’t fossil fuels
2259 2018-11-30 20:18:45 I really turn my car on every day and ignore it telling me it needs an oil change
2260 2018-11-30 20:18:41 Really?! Lol my aunt always told me baby oil is the best makeup remover 
2261 2018-11-30 20:18:37 All they did was leave you mango and fish oil, naa sis 
2262 2018-11-30 20:18:30 Na katon gardi fa
2263 2018-11-30 20:18:07 And note I used the lower 1.9 M capacity number for heavy oil rather than the 2.2 million capacity number for lighter crude. At 2.2 million barrels the cost difference really blows up. 8 fewer trips per year to handle 300k barrels a day of light crude.
2264 2018-11-30 20:18:06 Technically, the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973 that Saudi Arabia led against the U.S. and its allies was an act of war. Kind of like interfering in an election.
2265 2018-11-30 20:18:03 Nymex Settles 11/30/18 - CL Jan19: 50.93 (-0.52) (+1% vs Last Week) #nymex #wti #oil
2266 2018-11-30 20:17:55 As per the Guardian article I included above, capitalism and competition did nothing to stop the oil industry from covering up knowledge of climate change effects of their products.
2267 2018-11-30 20:17:48 I wish someone would come get me. I don’t wanna sit here and wait on my oil to get changed 
2268 2018-11-30 20:17:24 A flask is a closed ecological systems that do not rely on matter exchange with any part outside the system. Earth does not get minerals, oil, water or oxygen from outside. Earth does dispose a toxic waste to outside. The only thing Earth gets from outside is solar energy.
2269 2018-11-30 20:17:21 4) Also allow new oil and gas pipelines to service those power plants -- much safer and less expensive than railroads. We are effectively subsidizing railroads by obstructing pipelines.
2270 2018-11-30 20:17:20 Finally gettin a long overdue oil change 
2271 2018-11-30 20:17:19 That's exactly what I'm talking about, we have to make people more valuable so they become a good investment again.  Much the same way we have bent over backwards to make universities, military contractors, oil, pharma, etc... more valuable.
2272 2018-11-30 20:17:17 Unfortunately, Steady Eddy blinked in the face of public pressure and did not raise rates or otherwise slow oil development.

Fast forward to today, with too much output for the capacity in place and low prices even before the differential.

3/3
2273 2018-11-30 20:17:10 Even @chevrolet makes an electric car that rocks now (Bolt... I'm getting 270 a solar charge) 

OIL IS NOTHONG. Nobody will want it in 20 years! 
#PropagaPresident
2274 2018-11-30 20:17:06 Jez, you've got our oil, gas, windpower, and just about everything else. Fucks sake leave our patron saint!
2275 2018-11-30 20:17:04 @KUOWshow  Former AG McKenna sounds like he is squirming. Please ask him what's up with the coalition of oil companies.
2276 2018-11-30 20:16:58 $10 Trump is told to say the earthquake in Alaska could have been prevented if there wasn’t oil in the ground greasing the tectonic plates.
2277 2018-11-30 20:16:57 You would expect employees would understand by now that the @OilGasCanada is a cyclical employer and have emergency funds. If not they should learn. I'd encourage kids to go into trades other than the ones for the oil industry. No job security.
2278 2018-11-30 20:16:48 Right after the Khashoggi incident is when Oil fell off a cliff… clearly, he had an impact & got ht eSaudis to pump more. You may not like Trump, but don’t let your hate blind you. I despise Barack Obama, I still figured out how to trade to win.
2279 2018-11-30 20:16:47 And here morbid me thought that human life had already been established by the oil industry lawsuits as $4-8 million. *sighs*
2280 2018-11-30 20:16:40 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.
2281 2018-11-30 20:16:40 Maybe some salt to help absorb the oil and acid.
2282 2018-11-30 20:16:39 Nor am I, but I did study maths ;-)
Someone there did not pass their maths GCSE, but did pass their snake oil diploma.
2283 2018-11-30 20:16:35 At the moment I've used As I Am Twist Defining Cream and DoubleButter Cream with a caster oil/jojoba oil mix to seal it in. Cowashed with As I Am Coconut Cowash. At this length their As I Am Moisture Hydrating Lotion puffs it up it could be the wet weather contributing it
2284 2018-11-30 20:16:30 I will protect you!!!!!!!! and I will give you OIL!!!!!
2285 2018-11-30 20:16:19 I got crude oil
2286 2018-11-30 20:16:18 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
2287 2018-11-30 20:16:15 Ya breath smell like motor oil and earrrinf breaths 
2288 2018-11-30 20:16:13 Restaurant chips are inconsistent. House made kettle chips? Eh I’ll probably pass on those crispy pieces of fryer oil. 

Kettle chips in the bag? Yes please. Lays potato chips? Always
2289 2018-11-30 20:15:54 Her oil had said that Wayne had climbed.
2290 2018-11-30 20:15:50 Interfering with the sainted free market economy by capping oil production (that the major producers don't want).

@JKenney @KenneyFactCheck
2291 2018-11-30 20:15:49 Nice! I wish I was as smart as you as a child lol I only cook with coconut oil now as well. It’s a game changer.
2292 2018-11-30 20:15:48 This is extremely disturbing. Oil drilling is next, with safety regs rolled back. Big Oil does NOT own this planet & has no right to destroy it in cahoots with our corrupt president
2293 2018-11-30 20:15:35 With current economic policies, having no plans to outplay the imports over exports this value appreciation of INR ll be aberration and  benefits of slump in crude oil prices. ...
2294 2018-11-30 20:15:33 1. ramen, noodles and packet (cheap is great)
2. sauté your veggies in sesame oil, after they are crisp-tender, break an egg into the pan and break apart when cooked.
3. Kettle, in the mean-time: singing
4. bowl: noodles, veggies, meat, egg, packet, boiling water. Cover 4 minutes
2295 2018-11-30 20:15:27 3) And don't wait for a carbon tax to wipe coal out -- mandate conversion of all fossil fuel electric plants to oil or gas.
2296 2018-11-30 20:15:24 Quit the cannabis for couple weeks now! This weekend no oil or dry cannabis. Only thing I'm reading to much on internet, I guess learning is good but to much info your, brain just say to much lol 
2297 2018-11-30 20:15:20 All come with atleast tires unless someone took them you need Jerry can, motor oil, spark plug, batery, and a radiator to get er goin
2298 2018-11-30 20:15:01 working at a dealership = free oil changes 
2299 2018-11-30 20:14:59 Have you made the switch to #BrooklynBodyButter? Our products include:  Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Jojoba Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Apricot Oil, Avocado Oil, and a Premium Grade Fragrance Oil.
2300 2018-11-30 20:14:56 I don't like Octavius kitten, we are like oil and water (we don't mix well), but I simply blocked her rather than go into a ridiculous and pointless tirade.
2301 2018-11-30 20:14:50 What happened to global warming? What happened to the world depleting the oil supply in 20 years? That was 40plus years ago.
2302 2018-11-30 20:14:45 My favorite thing to do when I'm sick is to oil pull. I get better faster and there's instant relief from how clean my mouth feels.
2303 2018-11-30 20:14:44 A9 we also give him CBD oil for pets it helps with his anxiety issues and help him to relax ! #santachat
2304 2018-11-30 20:14:41 That's OK, my man. Dave Smith, Bob Knepper, Mark Wohlers, Oil Can Boyd, @Sut_ESPN and Iron Mike Bielecki, among others, got owned much worse.
2305 2018-11-30 20:14:37 Are you kidding me, the swamp is much deeper than ever, this is so false its not funny, you have a lobbyist for coal and oil no in charge of EPA, you have Devos who just made it easier for failing for profit colleges to keep accreditation hurting students
2306 2018-11-30 20:14:28 almond oil for your perinum but u a doctor so u know that;-) hop u all good - i went over with my second
2307 2018-11-30 20:14:27 @kevinmcgoran beans can you pass her email onto @kevinmcgoran now that he’s 2 weeks out of his 20s he’s learned how to make love and not just drill for oil!
2308 2018-11-30 20:14:26 So you’re telling me they’ve been putting syrup in my car every time I get my “oil” changed? Absolutely abhorrent.
2309 2018-11-30 20:14:23 @LBC Outgoing CEO of @networkrail early retirement and a gong , I do agree that oil background can be transferable skills  so can gilded cages , the Dave & George appointment  
2310 2018-11-30 20:14:16 A week in and my hair is full of oil and I don’t use any product. Dajah and Mia have the same issue. Such a pain in the rear.
2311 2018-11-30 20:14:15 The most incredible thing happened to me! Today started with a bad migraine that came on fast, was on one side of my head, & had me in the dark in tears. I randomly decided to try taking some of the new CBD oil I got and it is miraculously gone! First help in 20 years! #CBDlife
2312 2018-11-30 20:14:13 Lol he say na yoroba girl 
2313 2018-11-30 20:14:12 Lush is located at Chinook, Market mall . Don’t shop there if you support Alberta’s oil and gas sector
2314 2018-11-30 20:14:09 Aye, only thing going for it is mad xps. A lot of the time I just convert alaea salts into wobbegong oil then convert the oil into bowls.
2315 2018-11-30 20:13:59 The oil pipe will need to be inspected and that ain't no joke. Get ready for a spike in price.
2316 2018-11-30 20:13:49 I've lit oil burners,
2317 2018-11-30 20:13:49 No you don’t, because I used zero oil,
2318 2018-11-30 20:13:43 We it's not going to be easy is it. We can't just say ' what are you going to do about it' we all have to start asking ourselves what we can do.
We know the oil industry has given us a false economy that couldn't have sustained 7Billion people without it. It is killing us now.
2319 2018-11-30 20:13:41 Yes. You might recall that when oil was booming, there was a royalty review done under Premier Stelmach. The review concluded that royalties were too low.

At this time, unemployment levels were incredibly low and places like Tim Hortons were having problems filling jobs.

2320 2018-11-30 20:13:40 Indomie Relish is a disaster. Tastes like raw palm oil with crayfish.

So far so good, indomie chicken and oriental are d best
2321 2018-11-30 20:13:37 oil your tongue, it might move freely
2322 2018-11-30 20:13:35 Its got  alcohol denat in it. In longer  run it'll dry out hair even more. 
Try a mixture of cold pressed argan and coconut oil.
2323 2018-11-30 20:13:16 Just as planned. She pretends to be a champion of oil and gas but sits there watching and waiting for the industry to die in Alberta.
2324 2018-11-30 20:13:08 @jimiuorio @jeffkilburg huge selloff into close here on Oil. what levels did u guys get long at on todays trade? I know your upside targets
2325 2018-11-30 20:13:06 About to get out of this camp and go find me some dry shampoo to get this oil out of my hair before I ponytail it

2328 2018-11-30 20:12:37 @NayatuG tell her pls
2329 2018-11-30 20:12:34 Don't get me wrong: I detest Big Oil.
But why fight a battle for decades when they can be allies?
Millions of people have jobs b/c of them.
2330 2018-11-30 20:12:34 I'm in agreement with you.  Oil by rail is dangerous and the wrong way to go.
2331 2018-11-30 20:12:33 In my room. I can very likely get neem oil! I’ve never used it, will the mint still be safe to eat?
2332 2018-11-30 20:12:33 After today's 1% drop, US oil prices end November with a 22% plunge. It's the worst month for WTI since October 2008. #OOTT
2333 2018-11-30 20:12:23 ... orders oregano oil ^^
2334 2018-11-30 20:12:23 I doubt lawyers will be able to save anything. They will parcel out the assets to loan providers first. Then the liabilities of @OilGasCanada will be downloaded to private sector. Tapcal Trust Fund PCs decided long ago that jobs/money float is all we need to get from oil industry
2335 2018-11-30 20:12:21 Essential oil diffuser. I use it every day helps boost the mood as well as providing all the essential oil benefits. 
2336 2018-11-30 20:12:10 Maybe he will tell her ‘I flog’s you Oil at $50 a barrel and you mark it up to $132 a barrel heating oil... 
you nutcase old hag you freeze 30,000 elderly and vulnerable British people to death each year’ #justsayin
@TheSun #WinterPreventableDeath
2337 2018-11-30 20:12:07 Can only add to @OHK66's comments that this surge in production is a prescription for lower oil prices. Terrible that politicians celebrate this like frat boys instead of recognizing it as a waste of natural resources with profound security implications.
2338 2018-11-30 20:12:05 yup, that's Indiana alright. I guess sense the existential dread and soybean oil from here.
2339 2018-11-30 20:12:03 FFS Brian grow up. How can I invent oil revenues they are there for all to see in the Scottish Government's own figures are you really that thick you can't use fcking google or even simpler visit the Scottish Government's own website, you want the link?
2340 2018-11-30 20:11:57 Transporting tar sands oil by rail is dangerous and a threat to water.
2341 2018-11-30 20:11:49 I don't believe wat u say but I accept the fact that the log rates had gone up but now when it's coming appreciate it dont mix politics in it bcoz a rate of log is not just decided by cmpanies govt but also the international stock market trade on oil and gas too plays role
2342 2018-11-30 20:11:40 Yooo tea tree oil is the shit for your skin
2343 2018-11-30 20:11:32 Or maybe there's just too much fricken oil available with growth slowing and Trump has nothing to do with it.
2344 2018-11-30 20:11:23 Yeah I've only been to Lucas oil once cause I'm from NY, so same here
2345 2018-11-30 20:11:07 Ok, you’re the one who thinks Canada doesn’t need oil and can live on stored electricity....The US oil is also Shale oil...harder to extract than AB Oil Sands. 
Not that it matters because oil is a global demand as it is a national one
2346 2018-11-30 20:11:05 I like the chart, but there may be more dispersion this time in the high yield oil space
2347 2018-11-30 20:10:49 Maybe if we stop sending bombs and robbing oil, they might stop trying to flee and escape to England where the bombs don't land
2348 2018-11-30 20:10:47 Crocs after Labor Day? Tsk.
2349 2018-11-30 20:10:39 World needs energy sources other than oil and gas than they become obsolete
2350 2018-11-30 20:10:34 WTI oil down 52 cents, or 1%, to settle at $50.93/bbl 
WTI Jan.oil futures gain 1% for the week, losing roughly 22% for the month
2351 2018-11-30 20:10:22 It’s a tweak dip-s—t.  Has everyone heard about the sizemic explosions you approved that will kill thousands of  dolphins, whales and sharks because of oil drilling??  I find it so hard to believe the damage to our country that was caused by one EVIL person. Your Pathetic.

2354 2018-11-30 20:10:07 She likes drinking olive oil straight from the bottle
2355 2018-11-30 20:10:07 Carter, higher oil prices. Clinton, higher oil prices. Obama, higher oil prices. The same can’t be said about Reagan, Bush, Bush 2.0 or unfortunately, you. Where do I sign up for the Democrat Party for all the anti-american and the selfish, wrong reasons? Sick. Not good.
2356 2018-11-30 20:10:06 Good evening & thank you: I'm afraid that I missed your Tweet yesterday. Yes, this is a superb painting & also slightly unusual for a piece by Harold Steggles as it is oil on canvas: his preferred medium seems to have been oil on board.
2357 2018-11-30 20:10:03 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
2358 2018-11-30 20:09:58 You're a good person. A cynical prick like me just thinks the grift brothers see some opportunities taking money from progressives since the #resistance market is flooded with fellow snake oil salesman.
2359 2018-11-30 20:09:58 Did you guys know that Obama expanded this refuge area? Now the DOI website lists stewardship as its 4th priority behind American Energy, Jobs and Regulatory Reform. DOI just approved applications for oil/gas seismic tests off Atlantic that will kill/harass whales and dolphins.
2360 2018-11-30 20:09:57 It's not time to oil your rastas? 
2361 2018-11-30 20:09:56 Add it all up and the smart money is going to pass on TMX oil.
2362 2018-11-30 20:09:41 Wish I could say an Alaskan earthquake is surprising but it's on the edge of the same plate California is (which is way overdo for a quake to release pressure) and the state has essentially been a drilling ground for Oil Companies this last 30 years. Extremely man made event

2371 2018-11-30 20:09:01 You might as well delete your profile entirely. It's politicians like you that make people distrust politics so much. Stop taking credit for things that are not yours. If our youth can learn about supply chain and how oil prices are affected, you can too  #cdnpoli #onpoli

2374 2018-11-30 20:08:54 What about container ships?  They use heavy fuel oil that is super bad! Let's fix it! Together! :)
2375 2018-11-30 20:08:54 Tories clear mess? No they blame Labour for economic shocks 

1973 OPEC oil enbargo = global inflation rise.

1974 Labour inherited 16% inflation

1978 OPEC cut oil supplys & inflation shoot up again

1979 Thatcher blames labour & wins election

2010 Cameron blames labour & wins

2379 2018-11-30 20:08:39 Rachel eager acceptance of her role as spokeswoman for the oil lobby has made her a truly tragic person. The oil Boyz will never support her and she has abandoned her progressive base. She's toast.
2380 2018-11-30 20:08:25 Werid, b/c as someone that actually knows a little something here... from my view the country that currently looks like an illegitimate autocratic dictatorship run by a crime family relying on oil, who has stocked cabinet offices with unqualified family members is ... ours.
2381 2018-11-30 20:08:19 Finna get this oil change, chik fil a, and take my ass back home.
2382 2018-11-30 20:08:17 @RM_ChevyCad just called me about why I haven't been back to their service dept. Uh, maybe its the fact it took over 3 hrs for an oil change with an appt.  #WhyIGoElsewhere  Plz see @DaleJrChevy for tips.
2383 2018-11-30 20:08:16 Really wanted to get a standard oil change... damn jeep HAS to have synthetic oil. #grandcherokeeproblems
2384 2018-11-30 20:08:15 Removal of sanctions that would Rozneft and Exxon to complete their deal, granting Russia patented technology to drill in Siberia. The profits from this oil reserve would likely make Putin the richest man in the world. Until Bezos becomes a Trillionaire, that is.

Go ahead because thousands of people like me have installed solar panels & dumped our oil furnaces.I even sell some back to the grid.We do not want your toxic crap & your archaic rhetoric. Go home retrain your workers
2390 2018-11-30 20:07:48 PG&E (pacific gas and electric) here in N Calif, owned by the Rothschilds.  There's gold under those homes.  Generally, CA might be compared to the Clintons and Haiti, where they desired the gold and oil.  CA is also rich in gold, natural gas and oil.
2391 2018-11-30 20:07:47 To what purpose to what end did Canada continue its revenge on SA. In the end...............we still want to purchase their oil and sell them their military hardware. A few token useless sanctions, with long term poisoned relations in the Arab world. SA may purchase US or EU gear
2392 2018-11-30 20:07:41 Don't be obtuse.  This is proven.  Oil patch workers mean "men's work camps" which leads to prostitutes, which involves human trafficking.  Read a fucking book Pierre.  There's nothing idiotic about this statement at all.

2397 2018-11-30 20:07:25 Damn. We all have dream cars, right? Well what happens when we run out of oil this next century?  Lol
2398 2018-11-30 20:07:15 step one: cleanse your face. it’s veryy important to clean your face! if you don’t want to clean your face every morning and night, you can simply clean it at night, and water rinse in the morning. you may want an oil based cleanser because they deep clean and remove your makeup!

3. Dines and Dashes regularly
4. Invests in the oil industry
2400 2018-11-30 20:07:12 Yeah but it would be a net positive for the world if the oil industry ceased to exist. Ideally he'd get another job, and be guaranteed one, as everyone should

2404 2018-11-30 20:06:38 so i brought my mama car to get ah oil change rite...
2405 2018-11-30 20:06:38 Can OPEC consider this a win?  I think so, Trump deserves "credit" too:

"“This ‘make it up as you go’ policy from the world’s oil cartel created a new set of risks and made it difficult to invest in the sector with a longer-term timeframe,” Labanowski said."

2413 2018-11-30 20:06:07 Dems need fresh blood & a fresh start. Washington  has been controlled by a political class, on both sides. They have not served the people, only the big corporations in oil, military equipment, tech & e-commerce; so lots of billionaires, plus millions in poverty.
2414 2018-11-30 20:06:04 Hey what's the latest news about the oil spill off the east coast.... No clean up?   Letting it just spread?  It's your file Barbie... Step up to the Mike ...
2415 2018-11-30 20:06:03 I feel like @ctvedmonton @Edmontonsun @TheRebelTV @GlobalEdmonton need to do a story on @lushcosmetics and the #boycottLUSH movement before too many people buy from them this holiday season. Their stance on anti pipelines and anti Alberta oil sands is not okay.
2416 2018-11-30 20:06:03 Shiiiidd I paid all bills, got my oil changed, bout to hit the gym, get my nails and feet done, then go have some fuuuunnnn

2418 2018-11-30 20:05:52 That "100 companies" talking point is highly misleading. If everyone stopped using gas based vehicles today, Exon would be bankrupt within a month.

They're not drilling oil for fun, they're doing it to sell, to us.
2419 2018-11-30 20:05:45 Half a million bucks is pretty substantial. 
TMX will produce enough oil to fill 56 VLCCs per year.
At 20 cents per barrel savings that'sba $21 million a year premium. Hardly insignificant.
2420 2018-11-30 20:05:42 @JustinTrudeau Don't trust your plan based on Carbon Tax @cathmckenna did ot  give reassurance that it would work. C'mon now a cheque to Canadians wont compensate Oil stock price loses. Please build a ppl so we can realize full price @RachelNotley @fordnation

2425 2018-11-30 20:04:56 Absolutely! @LisaJernigan was one of the co-leaders of our trip & whether it was sitting in sacred spaces listening to stories, reading the Sermon on the Mount at the Mt. of Beatitudes or shopping for olive oil I thought of our mutual friend Hal MANY times.
2426 2018-11-30 20:04:37 I am doubling down on Oil Authority. Have 4 guys working on it despite our garbage pricing for WCS right now. People want change out there and I am going to give it to them.

2428 2018-11-30 20:04:20 We got to take our country back our country is the only country strong enough and Rich enough to take on the Saudis the Russians the ones that want to keep us using oil they don't care about tomorrow they just care about today so we need 65% of us to show up to vote that's it
2429 2018-11-30 20:04:17 Unless she knows what specific scents aggravate her, prob not. Parfums will likely aggravate her more than toilettes in general bc the scent is in the oil in parfums and it lasts longer
2430 2018-11-30 20:04:09 The fact is, and when I type this, it physically hurts my hands, because I’m an AMERICAN FIRST; before I care about my own wallet. The oil industry always has a better run with a Democrat running things, because they are so good at screwing things up. For over the last 40 years.
2431 2018-11-30 20:03:57 Aside from the further worsening of the climate, how are they moving the coal? Shipping already seriously impacts marine life with noise and oil pollution. How long before one of the coal ships actually runs into the Reef given they won't be carrying local pilots?
2432 2018-11-30 20:03:53 I buy the leaf or chop it off my aloe plant scrape out the jelly, mix a little essential oil or hair oil just a little, blend it throw in a spray bottle and you have the worlds best leave-in conditioner
2433 2018-11-30 20:03:51 NowThis Is An Ad That Needs To Be Pulled! I'm ashamed for @nowthisnews  that they have to stoop to slavering themselves in snake oil to make a buck
2434 2018-11-30 20:03:50 You don't know about the oil shocks of the 1970s and 1980s. How about using the Google machine to learn why this is important from a Natural Resource and Geopolitical perspective? There was a time where OPEC had the power to hold our economy hostage. #SelfReliance
2435 2018-11-30 20:03:47 "So what do you have going on this afternoon?"

2436 2018-11-30 20:03:47 If we are going to use oil, we might as well use our own oil instead of buying it from terrible countries who funnel the money into oppression or terrorism.

2439 2018-11-30 20:03:23 About 15 years ago, on a Greyhound Bus from Winnipeg to Calary, met a woman who was returning to work at Fort McMurry. She drove a bus that carried workers back and forth to oil sands. Many of cooks in these camps now women.  They are not as you said camps of past.

2443 2018-11-30 20:02:43 All a show...nice try pretty boy. Btw did you also meet with all the Oil tycoons when Alberta Oil took a dump? Or better yet when you pupped out of the pipeline being built? The easy out spend our money to vet rid of the problem. The problem just got worse asshole. Election day..
2444 2018-11-30 20:02:36 DT needs some cod liver oil.
2445 2018-11-30 20:02:25 RSPO Sourced Hydrogenated Palm Oil (15%).
2446 2018-11-30 20:02:22 I use smoked chaabani infused olive oil, red pepper flakes, salt, and a fried egg!
2447 2018-11-30 20:02:22 OH I BLISSFULLY FORGOT ABOUT OBAMA BRAGGING ABOUT OIL PRODUCTION!
2448 2018-11-30 20:02:18 I can be ur sugar daddy, got that Norwegian oil money
2449 2018-11-30 20:02:12 You can almost see the results now. US and UK back out of supplying arms to Saudi in exchange for Oil & Gas, Putin steps in to supply arms & then controls most of the World’s supply of Oil & Gas. Job done. It's hard to bite the hands that feed us but Russia cleans up when we do.
2450 2018-11-30 20:02:06 Your version of less political is very different to mine lol Y Erdogan so far has got away with so much - end of day Russia needs higher oil prices despite what Vlad what's to put a brave face about on
2451 2018-11-30 20:01:59 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
2452 2018-11-30 20:01:47 Heard... 7.0 magnitude earthquake in Alaska, Tsunami warning, #Oil pump shutdown... We don't know if this could have any impact on $CAD yet...
2453 2018-11-30 20:01:47 And how does that ‘gender lens’ look on Oil from the Saudis?
2454 2018-11-30 20:01:42 and Trump wants to lease W. edge of Arctic Refuge for Oil and Gas drilling!  the state will never recover as Alaskans already are dealing with life-changing climate shift issues/ TRUMP MUST BE STOPPED ....LIVES ARE AT STAKE
2455 2018-11-30 20:01:41 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  and America out there creating wars and shit for oil and stuff and religion all of a sudden is the world's biggest problem, eh!!?!

2457 2018-11-30 20:01:31 It would be useful to find a way to use #smallbizsatuk to jump-start discussion on rebalancing trading conditions, which are currently biased towards drive-in supermarkets (business rates & parking).

We need to move away from the narrative of "supporting", towards #fairtrade.
2458 2018-11-30 20:01:29 Nat, I am not so muscular and good-looking but I have no student loans and I wear proper fucking boots like an actual male. DM me for references. ;)

@Oil_Guns_Merica
2459 2018-11-30 20:01:24 Nothing like getting an oil change and walking away giving your soul to them for things you didn’t know existed
2460 2018-11-30 20:01:22 Agree. Weirdly, this pub used to be excellent for options which would have pushed Neck Oil off the podium...
2461 2018-11-30 20:01:19 I heard boygenius cover Cowboy Take Me Away by the Dixie Chicks the other day and it was so good. Like Kenan and Kel level good. Like “I’m gonna need 2 frying pans, a quart of motor oil, a box full of rubber bands...ahhh here it goes” level good.
2462 2018-11-30 20:01:18 The real reason democrats and republicans are voting on ending the war of Yemen is because Saudi role in USA plans is going to change.
The oil is losing its power, Saudi is loosing its power, and they are becoming poorer, and cannot afford to buy weapons with billions of dollars
2463 2018-11-30 20:01:13 You want to import more slaves no problem just feed usnsomemore of that crued oil your guys fart out
2464 2018-11-30 20:01:09 Flashing lights say "bikes on bridge" but it would be much better to just have the right lane be right-turn only.  ODOT says they would have to cut into the hillside (leaking oil tanks = won't happen) and install a signal head (they couldn't imagine a 25mph speed limit I guess.)
2465 2018-11-30 20:00:47 Now we have to pay a premium for steel to construct an oil well, because of your Tarriffs, but we don’t get the same equal protection. I’m tired of the onshore domestic oil industry being treated like a doormat for the rest of the country. I’m sure others feel the same way too.
2466 2018-11-30 20:00:46 Olive oil Eco styler or Gorilla Snot
2467 2018-11-30 20:00:42 Oh I get it, kinda like Obama taking credit for American Oil production and the economy two years after he left office.
2468 2018-11-30 20:00:39 Ok so giving Trump the hotel was too obvious. 

So they gave Trump diamonds and oil?
2469 2018-11-30 20:00:37 It is grossly premature to conclude #soybean OIL posted more than a "one-week save." Yet, SOLID followthrough gains next week would raise  potential for something "big" to be happening, but so would SOLID losses for the coming week. May be pivotal battle - for EITHER side to win!
2470 2018-11-30 20:00:24 My oil teacher just threw a paint tube on the floor saying “I don’t like burnt umber! We don’t use burnt umber in here. Or phthalo blue!”

It involves all those, a 30 ft gorilla, and about 20 bottles of olive oil.
2476 2018-11-30 19:59:55 I don't always get it right myself but best results are when oil is hot enough to smoke when meat is added.
Also, pan/wok should be big enough that the whole batch is in direct contact with hot oil/side.
2477 2018-11-30 19:59:51 #CrownPrinceInG20  Saudi achievements      a global economic power and  have giant oil companies
2478 2018-11-30 19:59:39 You can delta botanicals flavored CBD oil. They are great taste and flavors plus you get the best therapeutic medicine.
2479 2018-11-30 19:59:34 Genius must have been changing the oil.
2480 2018-11-30 19:59:24 Looks like Marley is considering exiting his oil positions at a loss to get the tax break. I'm doing the same.
2481 2018-11-30 19:59:17 Oh. You want to go for a ride? Lemme run in and get my backpack so we have some place to put the oil. *he laughs and points to the trailer* wait here?
2482 2018-11-30 19:59:16 I need some bio oil
2483 2018-11-30 19:59:16 How about you focus on something productive? Whining about a dying industry won't bring it back. Ask the orange bafoon next door how "bringing back beautiful coal" is working out for them? FFS put on your big girl panties and think FORWARD! Oil is the PAST. Be a future thinker!
2484 2018-11-30 19:59:08 Edmonton is  sunny. If you been here then you'd know. Your hate for responsible stewardship is appalling. Exposing OPEC and oil prices to your drones.
2485 2018-11-30 19:59:06 Brought to you by the GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra the origin of most Black Americans by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas. Let the Children of the Most High go. LIBERTY  AND FREEDOM.
2486 2018-11-30 19:59:03 Based on the number of likes for this excellent tweet, not enough people know what CBD oil is.

2489 2018-11-30 19:58:10 Anything anyone says to Saudi Arabia has to do with strategic geopolitics or Oil. They're not talking about humanitarian issues or human rights, you can bet the bank on that.
2490 2018-11-30 19:58:09 This is why I don’t go anywhere other than the @theDrybar for a damn blowout. My hair is still wet this bitch put some nasty ass oil in it. I refuse.
2491 2018-11-30 19:58:07 It truly sucks lol and ove gotta do it all again today and tomorrow.. minus the oil changes which are getting done sunday
2492 2018-11-30 19:58:07 I thought he understood the nature of the climate problem, but I guess not. Oil export ban is a wash, probably, but opening Arctic waters to drilling is a terrible idea.

2494 2018-11-30 19:57:53 Ty for all the advice I'll try some stuff and see what works :) I've also been growing out my hair so I feel like it just being on my forehead in general has been adding oil/dirty stuff
2495 2018-11-30 19:57:52 Praying for Cole. I too am using Cannabis Oil (RSO) to keep me alive!
2496 2018-11-30 19:57:48 this g20 meeting is analogous to oil around mid $70s with pending opec meeting coupled with analysts pitching the narrative oil possibly going to $100.but EW interpretation said, no matter what happens with the headlines from opec,  the only path to oil was down..oil now at $51
2497 2018-11-30 19:57:48 Grow up little man and stop handing out our tax dollars to the 1% who are also able-bodied and demand subsidies like oil companies.  Stop handing out money to soybean farmers who voted for Trump tariffs and don't want to face the consequences of their decisions.
2498 2018-11-30 19:57:37 So how about that Saudi oil?  Is it male or female workers your supporting over there?
2499 2018-11-30 19:57:37 back to your self-destructive olive oil habits :((((((
2500 2018-11-30 19:57:31 For sure dude. Have you done drops and vape oil? I’ve only used drops so far but kinda want to see how well the vape works.
2501 2018-11-30 19:57:30 My federal action concerned CBD hemp oil, which was made illegal in ID due to bribes paid out by GW Pharma, makers of the CBD "drug" Epidiolex. They had it worked out with the FDA to made CBD a "drug" and once again control this plant. It's all in my lawsuit.
2502 2018-11-30 19:57:28 you'll never convince me it's possible to take a bath without eucalyptus oil!!! never!!!!

2506 2018-11-30 19:57:15 You know that the net fiscal transfer in the years since North Sea oil and gas was discovered is still massively in Scotland's favour, right? The "we were done out of our oil" argument is a myth.
2507 2018-11-30 19:57:13 3 Factor that leads to appreciation of Rupees vs Doller.
.
1. Strong Stand of Modi Govt against the USA Sanctions on Oil Import from Iran 

2. Payment to Iran for Oil Trade in Rupees, helped conserve forex and appreciate the Rupee.

2509 2018-11-30 19:56:50 That is one big pipeline! That also means no oil from the north slope to Valdez.
2510 2018-11-30 19:56:49 S. Korean Train heading into N Korea

What’s in it?

Only thing showing in the pic is an Engine & a tanker

The tanker could be a string of tankers delivering heating oil for Christmas ?
2511 2018-11-30 19:56:46 When does Canada stop allowing their oil into this country? If it not today. That's bullshit
2512 2018-11-30 19:56:34 Go check your tires today, get that oil change, & your brakes done..
2513 2018-11-30 19:56:09 Oil futures end lower, tally a monthly loss of about 22%
2514 2018-11-30 19:56:07 ‘Then they groaned for a bit, said I should go’

‘I said, sit down and buy some oil’
2515 2018-11-30 19:56:06 @MSNBC Like to know how the oil platforms are doing? How is the pipeline recently modified from natural gas to oil doing? Trading Bay Area.
2516 2018-11-30 19:56:06 石油[タンク]︰an oil [tank]
2517 2018-11-30 19:55:58 President Obama successfully stayed out of the way of increase oil production. Something liberals will never forgive him!
2518 2018-11-30 19:55:56 Thanks Federal Highway Act and automotive and oil lobby groups!  You’re the best!
2519 2018-11-30 19:55:52 That’s a .002% cut to their budget. Nice try Kenny, but the grandstanding gets old. What is your plan for Alberta?  So far, I’ve heard a lot of your ads slamming Notley and the NDP, but not much about what you’re going to do about low oil prices and how to improve the market
2520 2018-11-30 19:55:49 Pipelines. Oil storage tanks. Many things.
2521 2018-11-30 19:55:40 Awesome. was expecting the Lucas oil 4x4 trucks not u on a motocross bike. No matter lov them both anyway. Awesome.wish we had more stuff like this on BT sports. Miss the Lucas 4x4 and the motocross we don't get its on free sports channel the monster energy series AMA 250 and 400
2522 2018-11-30 19:55:40 It's official: U.S. oil prices fell 22% (!!!) in November, their worst month since October 2008.
2523 2018-11-30 19:55:34 I guess he forgot his war on oil, and his multi million dollar buy back of gas guzzlers, and subsidies for electric vehicles and the billion dollars wasted on bankrupt solar projects.
2524 2018-11-30 19:55:33 As per my first example re: the oil industry, I fear that unethical players are using corporate money and dishonesty to try to counteract environmental science, or increase fears of the cost of environmentalism.
2525 2018-11-30 19:55:29 Could you just shut it for a minute?!  This is a natural disaster..deal with your “oil” opinions later!!
2526 2018-11-30 19:55:29 Deep Facts. 
Plenty Useful oil in your hands and head. 
I enjoyed every second with your tweets.
2527 2018-11-30 19:55:27 I just got laid off today due to the poor oil. Last thing I wanna see is his mug.
2528 2018-11-30 19:55:27 They cut out the part where the parent gives up on the oil trick and gets out a pair of scissors.
2529 2018-11-30 19:55:19 I’m sure he’s gonna blame Alaska when the price of gas goes up because of it- that oil pipeline carries oil . And #trump just bragged ,( and expected us to thank him( about how low gas prices are..
2530 2018-11-30 19:55:11 So they have leverage because of a deal that didn't happen two years ago? Same leverage if they offered him all their oil for favor.

Wait! How did Russia manage to buy our uranium when Hillary was SoS. And why a Clinton Foundation contributions down 90% since they are out? Hmmm.
2531 2018-11-30 19:55:04 Excellent, hope your right.  Gov working on moving oil and solving the over all problem.  Street circuses accomplish little other than riling up the Oil field trash (their term not mine).  Leave the circus to the clowns.
2532 2018-11-30 19:54:47 Oh no! Anchorage Earthquake. 7.0 magnitude. They just reopened the airport tower. This is frightening. oil pipelines?  This seems to have just happened.
2533 2018-11-30 19:54:45 I bet you Rattie will be the one to go
2534 2018-11-30 19:54:37 Głupota podszyta niewiedzą,  generalnie obserwując poziomy np. crude oil wti to teraz ON powinien być po 4,5- 4,6 ale wcześniej ponad 5 to norma przy poziomach 70$ za baryłkę. Tak to jest jak idioci na złość mamie chcą odmrozić sobie uszy.

2536 2018-11-30 19:54:30 The Trump administration just approved permits to use seismic blasting to prospect for oil in the Atlantic.

There are a LOT of potential negative consequences from seismic blasting (thread.)
2537 2018-11-30 19:54:30 Just add a bottle of palm oil and you are good to go

2541 2018-11-30 19:54:01 Obama is taking credit for the oil prices going down, so CEO of Shell rebuked him!
-states caused oil prices to drop, not federal, Obama had nothing to do w/it
-Obama removed lands from availability list for drill
-regulation was 60-80 pages changed by Obama to be 600-800 pages
2542 2018-11-30 19:53:59 إدارة معلومات الطاقة الأمريكية: صادرات الولايات المتحدة من النفط الخام ارتفعت إلى 2.116 مليون برميل يوميا في سبتمبر من 1.749 مليون برميل يوميا في أغسطس

2543 2018-11-30 19:53:55 @liberal_party Hm..Trudeau thinks rural woman can't handle construction workers so put off building bridges!We own a pipeline to nowhere! Alberta has to buy rail cars to ship it's oil!Ontario's electricity costs are unacceptable! No fear smoking pot will take our troubles away!
2544 2018-11-30 19:53:55 Yeah outside of a few occasions, the local media leave these guys alone.  The fans are a different ball game but media types are much worse in MTL, VAN & TO, it's not even a debate.
2545 2018-11-30 19:53:54 I was thinking who eats motor oil?
2546 2018-11-30 19:53:48 don’t you talk about oil that way
2547 2018-11-30 19:53:37 Better not to leave but if I was Scottish I would fight to get quick clean access to Europe and screw Westminster as they have screwed the Scottish for generations - imagine if Scotland had got to spend all their oil revenue ? They could be like Norway now
2548 2018-11-30 19:53:33 Do this and you will keep Virginia from being successful and making wise use of our offshore oil reserves. You will leave it to a future governor to bring that kind of success to Virginia.
2549 2018-11-30 19:53:33 legit laid in a bath of olbas oil coz i refuse to let the flu stop me from ruining my life tomorrow on works xmas doo
2550 2018-11-30 19:53:26 Shouldn’t be a problem we have so much oil ......... oh wait ..... @liberal_party has destroyed that industry too.
2551 2018-11-30 19:53:25 And the current government bought a pipeline to begin to address that issue (burning though considerable political capital here in BC), yet to hear Albertans, nothing is enough. Perhaps have a quiet word in Mr. Irving's ear - refining companies buy foreign oil, not government.
2552 2018-11-30 19:53:15 These people have literally been changing my oil for the last 2 hours 
2553 2018-11-30 19:53:08 Newfoundland has plenty of oil - most of which gets shipped to the USA's refineries.
2554 2018-11-30 19:52:54 Someone should advise the US Congress that the US economy will be shaken if these men (the oil leaders) are allied against the United States interests bcz of the stupidity of the Democrats in the Congress.
Do not loose SA
2555 2018-11-30 19:52:40 I live in an oil and gas town and have gone thru booms and busts.I might add this bust is self inflicted(no pipelines).During the booms our crime rates go down(not as many desperate young men out of work). We also have plenty of in transitory workers.Econ.loves it(hotels etc.)
2556 2018-11-30 19:52:36 Russia got dropped sanctions, which would open #Rosneft oil deal. A stolen election is a feather in cap & dismantles US democracy, U.N. & England (via Brexit)
2557 2018-11-30 19:52:35 Oil change, rent paid , other bills paid 
2558 2018-11-30 19:52:28 The future is longer than the next twenty years.

Paper industry declined rapidly as demand for newsprint fell. 

Supply of oil has increased and demand will decline as auto industry moves to EVs.

2560 2018-11-30 19:52:21 There are so many reasons this is wrong, including economic impact of oil exploration on local business. This administration is corrupt. #SaveEarth #Resistance  Trump administration approves seismic tests that could harm thousands of Atlantic dolphins and whales ?tid=ss_tw-amp
2561 2018-11-30 19:52:18 And this crap from Jerry is why this team has never handled success under his ownership. It's one win. In November. The team is 7-5. As the Cowboys last real head coach would say, "put down the anointing oil."
2562 2018-11-30 19:52:18 hope oil
2563 2018-11-30 19:52:13 Too bad oil price is so low, would have been nice to turn excess soybeans into #biodiesel & corn into #ethanol.  Still a good visual of farm trade #tariffs pain.
2564 2018-11-30 19:52:12 No, Shetland is part of Scotland. If they were independent from Scotland, under international law they would be classed as an enclave, with no oil fields in their territorial waters.

2566 2018-11-30 19:52:11 So, oil drilling causes earthquakes?
2567 2018-11-30 19:52:10 Pretty sure it's because Norway exports a lot of oil
2568 2018-11-30 19:52:09 Not shopped @IcelandFoods before today and pleasantly surprised by their vegan range. Add to that 10% discount for #NHS emergency service staff as way of a little thank you from Sir Malcolm Walker. Oh and palm oil free! Well done guys.

2571 2018-11-30 19:51:48 Exporting less aluminum, less oil and gas, less lumber, less cars and less steele is definitely not a canadian win
2572 2018-11-30 19:51:46 Add offshore oil industry to that. @POTUS44 shut down the Gulf of Mexico for six months while the Republicans stood idly by doing nothing. #thanksObama

2576 2018-11-30 19:51:31 Because of oil prices go up in 70s thats made saudis get married , now marriage become something more difficult to middle class men so the government try to help them giving them around 5000 dollars which is not enough , decreasing in population will come again soon
2577 2018-11-30 19:51:24 Of the 7 facilities capable of refining our bitumen in Asia how many have committed to buying our dilbit? Hint the answer is 0. TMX was designed to get oil to the coast where it will travel to the US Gulf via the Panama Canal.

2580 2018-11-30 19:51:17 Ok I got my oil changed. I got the nail taken outta my tired. Paid my phone bill. I’m a good adult today.
2581 2018-11-30 19:51:15 We would be totally free of fossil fuels decades ago, if big oil interests hadn't killed off hundreds of inventions by buying off or killing their inventors.
2582 2018-11-30 19:51:03 The magnitude 7 #Earthquake that struck #Alaska today has shut down the Alaska pipeline threatening #CrudeOil #Exports.  The pipeline carries #Oil from the #ArticCoast to the marine terminal in Valdez. The pipeline transported 530,000 barrels just yesterday.  #BOE #BPD #OilandGas
2583 2018-11-30 19:51:02 Stick to American made cosmetics Lush something you may know something about.  You have a huge credibility gap re oil & gas. Will never support you or your products. # Boycott
2584 2018-11-30 19:50:56 can someone please bring headphones to my oil change helllppppp
2585 2018-11-30 19:50:54 Is this where we are headed with #ClimateChange alarmist. First oil, then your kids?
2586 2018-11-30 19:50:49 It is very disappointing to see Canadians on social media pushing the anti Canadian oil angle. I fell like they’re traitors and supporting oppression / human right violations.  We’ll always need some fossil fuels for one reason or another, why not our own.
2587 2018-11-30 19:50:45 *something happens in Ak*

President:  “Hmpf. They have their oil to back them up.”

*something happens down-south, for the billionth time*

President: ”we must find who did this and do something about it. Or we will make people who were bystanders, responsible”
2588 2018-11-30 19:50:41 Congressman-elect Joe Cunningham is "extremely disappointed" re: news Trump admin has approved seismic tests off Atlantic. Says it "not only has significant environmental implications, it moves the Lowcountry one step closer to dangerous and unwanted offshore oil drilling" #scpol
2589 2018-11-30 19:50:34 Good shout on the PCV valve. I’ve changed mine and the oil consumption stopped... now normal...
2590 2018-11-30 19:50:34 Let's #GoCats. Are you going to Indy for the B1G Championship? Kickoff at Lucas Oil is Saturday 8:00pm ET (7:00pm in Evanston/Chicago).
2591 2018-11-30 19:50:27 is it weird that I bought this new steaming shower oil infuser & all I want to do is shower now
2592 2018-11-30 19:50:26 100’s? Jason, I have news for you. 10’s of thousands of oil workers and tradesmen are currently out of work in Alberta. Some for months on end.
2593 2018-11-30 19:50:23 IHOP waitress: “hey folks, how is everything so far” 

Me, pissed off as hell slamming my fists down on the table: “THIS IS THE INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF LIES, THERES NOT ONE DRIP OF MOTOR OIL AND/OR ONE SLIVER OF CARDBOARD ON MY PANCAKES”
2594 2018-11-30 19:50:19 Will
2595 2018-11-30 19:50:16 Yet we continue to buy hundreds of millions of dollars of Suadi oil and defacto support their impact on women. JFC.
2596 2018-11-30 19:50:13 I’ve been seeing a lot of people argue that the “two parties are the same” because of Obama being proud of the oil industries.

Yes Obama being proud is not a great thing for climate change but you have to be delusional to think that means democrats and republicans are the same.
2597 2018-11-30 19:50:07 i'll fight you... but just so i can get your garlic chilli and olive oil. delish
2598 2018-11-30 19:49:57 No oil producing country on the list Angola, Nigeria , Libya 
Non of the the major economies on the list Nigeria , South Africa, Egypt
2599 2018-11-30 19:49:56 Weeeeeeell... not really! It’s made from chickpeas! Hummus has garlic and lemon - plus salt! It’s like saying:  “cookies made from mayonnaise” because they happen to contain egg and oil 
2600 2018-11-30 19:49:53 Yeah,Especially with oil & toys  xx
2601 2018-11-30 19:49:50 get yourself a nourishing facial oil, black cumin,argan,rose hip and hemp are great choices, depending on your skintype.gently massage them into your damp skin.
nourish yourself with good foods, if you can cook a nutritious and comforting meal , otherwise go for an easy snack
2602 2018-11-30 19:49:40 The @VegasHockeyPod is back tomorrow at 2PM Eastern - 11AM #Vegas! Will discuss #GoldenKnights Nylander & #Leafs #Flyers #NHLBlackhawks #Yotes. Also 2 big guests in @dhellingsports & @Oil_Drop. It's a must listen
2603 2018-11-30 19:49:39 I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not! But what is funny is how terrible of a deal Alberta has for its oil. A proper oil deal is when the territory who has the oil gets 85% of the value of the oil. Alberta has the same deal as Nigeria, which is seen as a bad deal.
2604 2018-11-30 19:49:36 Have you tried drinking HELLLLLA water and CBD oil? 
2605 2018-11-30 19:49:32 Nice try.
But there have been protests across dozens of countries over fuel prices ... and most of them don't have any form of carbon tax.
On Oct 4, oil price spiked at US$84.65/bbl. Yesterday it was at US$58.42. These prices have nothing to do with climate change.
2606 2018-11-30 19:49:32 Y al que no lo entienda así, es porque le lavaron el cerebro con Pull Oil.
2607 2018-11-30 19:49:32 Aye. Ire raising 300 with +/- no oil, gas etc. against Sco 200 doesn’t seem to add up.
2608 2018-11-30 19:49:18 I was thinking:
-stopping sanctions over Ukraine events
-free hand in Crimea and Black Sea
-US surrender in Syria (for all practical purposes)
-US Energy policies that long term favor Russian oil production & prices
2609 2018-11-30 19:49:17 Russia plays low role on international stage. Only its voice heard cause it possesses a nuclear weapon. Although, economically Russia is weak and heavily relies on oil prices. The U.S. crushed the Soviet Union once it can surely do same now.

2613 2018-11-30 19:48:48 This ETF is an interesting one because fund flows and oil’s performance tend to move in opposite directions. It’s used as a tool to make bets on short-term price reversals typically
2614 2018-11-30 19:48:47 This one that you’re looking fat.. hmmm 
2615 2018-11-30 19:48:43 Exactly ... festives and being broke, water and oil.
2616 2018-11-30 19:48:43 #US stocks gained as #investors focused on the outlook for trade ahead of a meeting between the American and Chinese presidents. #Treasuries edged higher and #oil fell!
2617 2018-11-30 19:48:40 Drilling in the ground for oil in Alaska for years and now there’s a giant earthquake. Wonder if that’s related? Lol
2618 2018-11-30 19:48:33 #CrownPrinceInG20  Saudi achievements to control the stability of the oil market, which is a key engine of the global economy
2619 2018-11-30 19:48:27 The Mission have just reminded me that I need to buy some more Patchouli oil #TOTP
2620 2018-11-30 19:48:26 And that’s why the NDP are running $7 billion deficit cuz there’s no royalty, no energy taxes flowing in. So big oil helps to pay the bills. Interest on borrowed money now topping $1.2 billion. Not sustainable.
2621 2018-11-30 19:48:25 i wouldn't, i would just run it off a cliff at the first sign of trouble slash first oil change
2622 2018-11-30 19:48:25 Getting oil changed
2623 2018-11-30 19:48:13 US oil demand up 311kbpd or 1.6% y/y to 19.951mbpd in September - EIA #OOTT
2624 2018-11-30 19:48:07 Bill - pipelines at capacity resulting in record differential. Need infrastructure which benefits all Canadians instead of importing American & Saudi oil. Also need a pipe out to the east as we are meeting domestic demand with foreign oil. Surely a good idea eh? 

Clear now?
2625 2018-11-30 19:47:57 They are oil partners and they are mad @realDonaldTrump for lowering gas  prices.
2626 2018-11-30 19:47:49 Man I had to go get my oil changed all alone today :((
2627 2018-11-30 19:47:45 The carbon tax is the reason the oil industry is shit. It’s the reason we aren’t building pipelines. Politicized? Give me a break.
2628 2018-11-30 19:47:45 Yes it’s a super gentle cleansing oil !
2629 2018-11-30 19:47:36 In the 50's Alaska became a state and Anchorage finally got better earthquake resistant buildings because... wait for it... the oil companies. So more drilling will only make things better, again.
2630 2018-11-30 19:47:36 wow- is it a weak month seasonally for oil? inventory builds for winter.
2631 2018-11-30 19:47:36 My home town in Texas would implode if oil was $30.
2632 2018-11-30 19:47:30 True lol I think it was more ointment than oil 
2633 2018-11-30 19:47:18 The most essential oil of all time!
2634 2018-11-30 19:47:17 I get it, politically it’s more expedient to help farmers, unions and coal miners because they are large homogenous groups that stick together. In my lifetime, I’ve never seen anybody lament a distressed oil worker out of a job. Cheap energy MADE AMERICA GREAT in the first place.
2635 2018-11-30 19:47:15 Then why does the democrat accept oil money and obama brains about it?

2638 2018-11-30 19:47:05 Obama would like a little credit for the increase in oil production keep in mind. Can we fact check this?
2639 2018-11-30 19:46:59 I give the old boss a fail but I’m not impressed with the new boss. I don’t have much issue with Notley. She’s working in a shitty environment and Kenney would be working in the same environment. And I’m talking about oil prices and getting our product to market. Nothing else.
2640 2018-11-30 19:46:50 Name one time where he, or any other President, took anyone's oil without paying market price for it.

Let me help you, you won't be able to do it.

It's not what we do as Americans.
2641 2018-11-30 19:46:45 The oil companies have been familiar with climate change since the 1950s without telling them and they knew that carbon dioxide contributes to the greenhouse effect. This is a scandal and they only think of money.
2642 2018-11-30 19:46:44 Just heard on CBS that the Trans-Alaska pipeline is shut off due to the earthquake. #oil
2643 2018-11-30 19:46:28 It’s hard to believe than Canada buy US oil when we have difficulty to sell our oil, funny
2644 2018-11-30 19:46:25 The birds are an issue but a disaster? A disaster is dumping millions of litres of oil on the Gulf of Mexico or the Arctic. Disaster is the amount of energy required to mine coal and the impact of the damage of mining and permanent effect on water tables

2650 2018-11-30 19:45:46 yeah so my check engine light came on in my car and I thought it was just needing an oil change but nope it’s the catalytic converter, and replacing it will cost more than the car is worth, in conclusion my baby isn’t gonna be around much longer and I’m sad :((
2651 2018-11-30 19:45:43 we have an army of Maccabees, a surprisingly robust supply of oil and...some jelly donuts, I guess. let's make this happen.
2652 2018-11-30 19:45:32 did it taste like motor oil?
2653 2018-11-30 19:45:22 Did you apply the oil yourself?

2659 2018-11-30 19:45:09 Paddy you would hardly think we are a country surrounded by massive oil fields.
2660 2018-11-30 19:45:08 Here in SoCal it's the rain /road oil combo that is so hazardous.
2661 2018-11-30 19:44:59 Welcome to Oil Country, Val!
2662 2018-11-30 19:44:50 I jump around a lot from brush to brush. It really just depends on what you want to accomplish. I used the ink bleed brush for the line and the oil paint brush for the color on this one.
2663 2018-11-30 19:44:50 If you’re increasing production to export 650 000 barrels / day you will indeed be increasing emissions, regardless of what caps you have on paper. You’re already playing Russian Roulette with safety, sending out oil tankers from Westridge without any Spill Response protections!
2664 2018-11-30 19:44:49 *at the oil changing place & they tell me something needs to be done w my car*                                                                “hang on lemme call my dad”

2667 2018-11-30 19:44:32 This emerging market only exists because of subsidies. When subsidies are gone, so are the companies. 

Oil creates revenue for the government. Solar costs money to the taxpayers.
2668 2018-11-30 19:44:29 Agree, but If I'd shown you the choices of other beers on at said pub, you'd be having Neck Oil, too.

2673 2018-11-30 19:44:10 Went through this for several years with a cat. Laxatone is an option. It's intended to allow hairballs to pass by lubricating things. You might try using fish oil drops on dry food.
2674 2018-11-30 19:44:10 4 years ago, a lot of graduates had no job and no means of daily livelihood. Today, N-power is providing something for so many of the unemployed graduates.
What did pdp do for graduates and the youths in the 16 years rule of oil boom?
2675 2018-11-30 19:43:56 Conversation went. .

Me: argan

Guy 2: isn't that a gas 

Me: yes it is but it's a-r-g-a-n

2677 2018-11-30 19:43:47 Well do it big and have fun! Who’s @JohnWDRB working with? Surely won’t be as fun as standing next to me in my red Staples polo at Lucas Oil.
2678 2018-11-30 19:43:44 I finally got my oil changed so all of y’all can stop subtweeting about me now. 
2679 2018-11-30 19:43:42 Oil boom? Funny. If there was an oil boom why did gas prices go up at an expedential rate
2680 2018-11-30 19:43:37 The Alaska oil pipeline has been shutdown for inspection. CANADA: OPEN UP THE SPIGOT... FOR YOUR SOUTHERN COUSIN!
2681 2018-11-30 19:43:23 Juncker a few weeks ago:

It is absurd that the EU pays for its oil imports in USD when only 2% of those imports come from the US.

The direction of travel is clear. Pipeline moves confirm it.
2682 2018-11-30 19:43:04 I buy bulk bags from the Pak World Supermarket in Warrington. (Yes that is its proper name!). Dry roast for about 12 mins. Cool a bit. Whizz for ever and a bit more in a coffee grinder/small blender. Tiny spot of oil if needed.
2683 2018-11-30 19:43:04 I need to go to the DMV then get my oil changed, but man I don't feel like going out today.

2686 2018-11-30 19:42:46 The plant thats my ‘home frequency’ is Tulsi(Holy Basil). 

I drink it daily. I use it in the essential oil form(diffusing, baths, EFT), I use it in homeade herb infused oils (massage) and as a hydrosol(flower water). 

What’s your home frequency plant and how do you use it?
2687 2018-11-30 19:42:45 Let’s get over Neck Oil. It’s good, but it’s no Tap Sipper.
2688 2018-11-30 19:42:42 Our world burns because tin-foil hat chasers like you keep your sheeplings in paranoia and fear dude. Global warming is a science thing. You all made it a "globalist" issue. The globalists you speak of gain nothing from their oil interests if it is true.
2689 2018-11-30 19:42:37 There is some reputation of India on International Stage. We seem to be loosing it all.. as far as Oil is concerned, Iran & Iraq can pump up the need and give us respect as well. #Saudi are loosing it... We shud not sink with them
2690 2018-11-30 19:42:34 Say what you May but for Gods sake don’t say that the Rupee was artificially kept at low levels against the dollar. If it could be kept low artificially why it crossed 140 mark today. More relief could be given on Diesel/Petrol/Kerosene as oil price is low in the int’l Market!
2691 2018-11-30 19:42:33 tryin out this new place for an oil change, villasenor is just too far now 
2692 2018-11-30 19:42:28 I don't know how much in policy must happen or radical lifestyle changes. Either way Big Renewable Energy is moving too slow and the oil industry's getting subsidies to suck out every last drop of shale oil
2693 2018-11-30 19:42:27 No to Beto. He cozied up to AIPAC and was the top recipient of oil and gas and 2nd for hedge funds. He is a neoliberal packaged as a progressive.

2696 2018-11-30 19:42:15 Good news for SNAP recipients, breathing a sigh of relief they dont actually have to look for or get a job. 
You cant craft something that incentivizes work while not cutting them off entirely?
2697 2018-11-30 19:42:14 That’s the one. We’re good at doing some bits of a car, France is good at other bits. We make good haggis, they make good olive oil. That kind of thing.
2698 2018-11-30 19:42:05 When i go back to this oil field in the summer... my money gone be up there  i ain’t gotta worry bout no female trynna dog me.... I’m Doing me it’s my turn 
2699 2018-11-30 19:41:47 So, according to the #UCP and its various mouthpieces, the Government of Alberta needs to act immediately on the oil price differential. #ableg #abpoli /1
2700 2018-11-30 19:41:38 I don’t deal with zest or Irish spring niggas. The point is you niggas wash your face with soap and moisturize with coconut oil and be just fine lmao

2703 2018-11-30 19:41:32 Buhari policies are socialist in nature

In a failing economy & a low global oil price system, how does he intend to sustain this 'dash me' policies?

Maduro continued insistence on using Chavez socialist model for Venezuela led to further economic loss

Nig is getting there
2704 2018-11-30 19:41:03 The lamp of wisdom is fueled by the oil of contentment.
2705 2018-11-30 19:41:01 Great shout for oil hall of fame.
2706 2018-11-30 19:40:45 And Drai shouldn't be your winger. I totally see what your saying. Oil management literally just picking up whatever scraps for wingers the league has throwing it to the wall and seeing what sticks. Also I think it is essential for 98 to see top 6 mins in order to go anywhere.
2707 2018-11-30 19:40:43 I hear you’re shopping around to see if any of your oil & gas buddies will have you on their board. Funny thing is...they don’t. Not even Halliburton. #Resign #Zinkeiscorrupt

2709 2018-11-30 19:40:25 Yep. First major storm of the year is just one giant oil slick.
2710 2018-11-30 19:40:19 Yes, let’s use some of the money we give away to the Brexit conmen. Thank you Stephen for trying to get a straight answer from one of the many snake oil salesmen in government.
2711 2018-11-30 19:40:17 FACT: Oxymoron refers to the discovery of electricity in the 19th century, nervous systems used oil.
2712 2018-11-30 19:40:12 But oil, gas, and coal companies will continue to get rich, so pluses and minuses?
2713 2018-11-30 19:40:09 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
2714 2018-11-30 19:40:04 Welcome to Canada we support Saudi oil and spend hundreds of million on illegal border crossers while undermining our natural resource sector and abandoning our veterans #wtf

2720 2018-11-30 19:39:01 Oil's not a problem anymore.  We're the world's #1 producer now.    And North Korea is an issue because of their esteemed leader and their proximity to, and support from, China....

2729 2018-11-30 19:38:13 just the thought of someone eating an olive making me feel nauseous ... you wouldn't drink olive oil!
2730 2018-11-30 19:38:10 "I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers.
I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe  for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a  decent place for the National City Bank boys...."
2731 2018-11-30 19:38:09 Washing my face is 5 steps minimum but niggas can use zest and damn coconut oil and be okay. I don’t understand.

- KSA is the largest oil producer in the world

- KSA ranks fourth as the largest currency reserves in the world 

- KSA one of the least indebted countries in the world

2739 2018-11-30 19:37:47 I'm very glad your family is safe, also that you have to deal with what your partys pro oil drilling stance does to poor people. Maybe now you'll take a stand against efforts to increase drilling in Alaska? But prolly not.
2740 2018-11-30 19:37:43 Fresh popcorn made with olive oil & fresh rosemary.  Along with a nice rose wine.
2741 2018-11-30 19:37:42 It was Walmart lol
And I can still smell something burning even after the oil change, he said I just need to buy some stuff to seal it before it gets worse and it should be fine
2742 2018-11-30 19:37:35 “Support for North Sea Oil ans Gas industries” does she not mean “Theft of Oil and Gas revenues from North Sea”
2743 2018-11-30 19:37:24 Only a minority of oil producers subject to price differential.    Top 3 oil producers, Suncor, Husky, Imperial - are reaping record profit, pumping cheap bitumen to their refineries in the US.

Ones without refineries are losing $.   It's AB's fault for not requiring added value
2744 2018-11-30 19:37:23 If your car is newerish you can definitely switch back so long as it’s a full oil change and not a top up
2745 2018-11-30 19:37:18 In addition to ActOnClimate, @BarackObama followed an All-of-the-Above energy strategy -- including domestic oil and gas. He knew there were immediate considerations as well as future. 

Russian and Saudi oil $ bribe Donald Trump's foreign policy.
2746 2018-11-30 19:37:16 #WTI crude #oil back to $50/bbl
2747 2018-11-30 19:37:11 I wonder what you would as president? Blow the oil prices thru the roof or be like Hillary and steal money from the American public. 

You have no idea about running a country only complain.
2748 2018-11-30 19:37:06 Thanks Oil City Signs for the follow!
2749 2018-11-30 19:37:06 we are ADULTING today ladies we went to THE COUNTY CLERK OFFICE and filed PAPERWORK we got a CAR INSPECTION an OIL CHANGE we are KILLING THE GAME
2750 2018-11-30 19:37:06 I'm apologizing in advance for this "crude" joke:

Hehe ... Oil's "Magic Spot."

Got Girlfriend, Wife?? (they know)
2751 2018-11-30 19:36:59 I came for a simple car oil change and end up having a fucken Recall on my car
2752 2018-11-30 19:36:50 The imperfect is past tense that has a clause Nige. When something else is going in as well use Estaba for eg

I was driving the car when all of a sudden the oil light came on. 

Preterite is past perfect. Final if you like with no clause.

I was driving the car. = Preterite.
2753 2018-11-30 19:36:32 Which essential oil is best for getting people to stop talking to you
2754 2018-11-30 19:36:29 Had to act.  Hussein invaded a sovereign neighbor with huge oil reserves, then thumbed his nose at UN inspectors after we didn't finish him off the first time.   Two huge mistakes:  Not finishing what we started and then relying on the UN.
2755 2018-11-30 19:36:29 If you buy your gasoline from Saudi Arabian oil, you are homophobic.  See, we can play this game too.
2756 2018-11-30 19:36:28 I was thinking about this during Thanksgiving and the whole misconceptions around Yams/Sweet Potatoes. 

So much of our food and ways of cooking (e.g., hot oil for frying) really is based on African culture first, versus say slavery alone.
2757 2018-11-30 19:36:21 ....meaning oil $ will go back up (at least in US$)? 
2758 2018-11-30 19:36:19 Yuk! If adding anything like that - use Coconut oil not butter. But depends on quality of coffee  don’t ruin #coffeelink the amazing taste of single origins in this way!
2759 2018-11-30 19:36:07 You didn’t feel the oil off this?! 
2760 2018-11-30 19:35:59 Kentucky was the major  growing area. rope, cloth, oil.    many many uses. no coal jobs but hemp produce

MORE TERRORISTS BCZ OF 
NO FOOD & NO WATER .. 
ONLY OIL & WEAPON SPEAKS ..BY Selling Oil they r  generating money for to Buy Weapons. For to stop them we have to close their INCOME SOURCES. Then only they will listen to WORDS.Till that time Action speaks.
2769 2018-11-30 19:34:45 @DennysDiner is your syrup actually motor oil the public demands to know
2770 2018-11-30 19:34:45 I think that is a real world problem. Not switching off the oil flow to a burning platform because there is no HQ approval is an obvious case, but often it is only obvious retrospectively as in the Challenger case. Dealing with calculated risks is daily business.
2771 2018-11-30 19:34:36 Yes! I’m not from Massachusetts so I have no say here, but happy to hear that people have a deep understanding of what it means to glorify big oil.
2772 2018-11-30 19:34:36 I merely reviewed the script, Corie was the driving force for #PurpleLightUp at C4, but I'd like to think that I helped oil the wheels.
2773 2018-11-30 19:34:19 The men’s putting coconut oil on their face and still have beautiful skin smhhhhh
2774 2018-11-30 19:33:49 Is there such thing a mobile oil change service?
2775 2018-11-30 19:33:49 @Ed_Crooks I seem to remember that my oil price prediction for 2018 was $ 58 per barrel (Brent). Can we stop the year now please.
2776 2018-11-30 19:33:47 DJIA up slightly on mixed news that Alaska may have fallen into the ocean, but "lots" of oil has been "jiggled loose", bolstering supply.
2777 2018-11-30 19:33:42 Stick to music Bono. Didn’t the Bush family make its money from oil and military businesses.
2778 2018-11-30 19:33:42 I can't wait to hear who Trump blames for this Alaska earthquake. Any bets he puts it on the oil industry?
2779 2018-11-30 19:33:41 They do. Come to an oil town when it’s booming where sexual assaults against women rise because of the increase of transient workers. Come to an oil town during a bust and violence against women increases. I took the liberty of adding sources.
2780 2018-11-30 19:33:41 When you stop flying around on your jet, driving your Mercedes and stop heating your house with oil, then I might listen to you. #Hypocrite
2781 2018-11-30 19:33:38 I work with someone who's fiance works on an oil rig. Is that close enough?
2782 2018-11-30 19:33:37 深圳、Oil以外に良い箱あったら教えて偉い人（上海Elevater/成都TAGみたいなとこなら尚可)
2783 2018-11-30 19:33:25 Does your vehicle leak? Take all the oil out. It can’t leak if there’s no fluid in it, dumbass.
2784 2018-11-30 19:33:24 Business and oil first!
2785 2018-11-30 19:33:22 Nope! Only a lil bit of coconut oil lotion if i even remember lol
2786 2018-11-30 19:33:19 I Don’t Have A Blow Dryer... And Some Oil...
2787 2018-11-30 19:33:16 Do you really think that the pipeline would be build by now or that oil prices would be any different if there were different governments in place today? I don’t.
2788 2018-11-30 19:33:01 Kenney is too busy being a racist to give a crap about oil.
2789 2018-11-30 19:32:52 Gold diggers they digging till they find oil 
2790 2018-11-30 19:32:50 1200 jobs lost in Ottawa and Ontario & news go nuts. 2014 when oil shit the bed we had 40,000-100,000 workers from Alberta go unemployed. Where’s the coverage? Where’s the heartfelt messages? We sucked it up and figured our shit out, didn’t cry and look for sympathy  #BertaOil

2793 2018-11-30 19:32:25 They are economically desperate. Russia’s national survival at this time depends on oil and gas exports, and Ukraine is very important. Intimidation is the only card they have to play, as they keep getting squeezed deeper and harder. There’s a bigger picture too long for Twitter.
2794 2018-11-30 19:32:14 YES!!!~ You cn put too many drops of spearmint oil in a bath
2795 2018-11-30 19:32:10 It's more like say hello to the same old bullshit that only benefits Wall Street, Big Oil, Big Pharma, etc.; plus some new bullshit of finding "common ground" with Trump & GOP.
Common ground =    
2796 2018-11-30 19:32:03 What a tit. Another snake oil salesman.

2800 2018-11-30 19:31:47 So that means an end to the 5or 6 billion dollar armoured car deal about 2 to 3 thousand workers and many more suppliers out of work  the end to the 20 billion dollars worth of oil from Saudi Arabia to Canada’s east coast  thanks to idiotic statements by Trudeau and Freeland

2802 2018-11-30 19:31:43 @dcb97 1953? Wasn't that the year Harley introduced the permanent oil leak?

2804 2018-11-30 19:31:23 He canceled your meeting too?

What a puss%!

Wait until we screw with the oil prices again.
2805 2018-11-30 19:31:21 Has Trump made a stupid tweet about the earthquake in Alaska?Someting like to many moose and caribou were running at the same time causing the earthquake. His solution would be to drill more oil and hunt more caribou and moose.

2811 2018-11-30 19:31:10 High five for stability of oil prices and world prosperity
2812 2018-11-30 19:31:07 Obviously you don't exactly know how much food pharmaceutical and oil China import from  US, or you won't call them necessity.
2813 2018-11-30 19:31:03 Because hes holding the oil prices down low.
@JustinTrudeau stop bowing down to a mohammed bin blah the prince of shit
2814 2018-11-30 19:30:51 I’ve got a call into the Premier demanding she solve the oil price crisis by Monday. There. Done!!
2815 2018-11-30 19:30:45 It heard Nick's call,
but the argument seems to be it was awakened from the Empty.
I don't think that's what the oil slick was.

IMO
It's not a DEAD god/angel.  It's just not one that we see active in our Christian paradigm. An old god, WAITING to be followed again.
2816 2018-11-30 19:30:40 I say that anyone who complains about the pipelines should go outside to their gas meters and turn them off...park their cars and trucks, get rid of all their plastics and almost everything else they use. Most things they use are thanks to oil products.
2817 2018-11-30 19:30:37 But I can’t replicate their sauces!
2818 2018-11-30 19:30:34 I'll eat them fried then with some olive oil and some pink salt and pepper. Yummy.
2819 2018-11-30 19:30:31 Could probably employ a few laid off oil and gas workers to build pipeline as well...

2824 2018-11-30 19:30:20 I saw four Teslas in Houston this week.  The oil/gas capital of the US.  Three S’s and an X.  No 3s.  I go to Houston regularly, have never seen a Tesla there before....
2825 2018-11-30 19:30:10 Probably a scam tbh most oil change places try to scam people...
2826 2018-11-30 19:30:06 Yes but please remember our government didn’t care about Otto it cares about money and oil from Saudi Arabia. That’s the difference
2827 2018-11-30 19:30:06 Do any of you know anyone who works on an oil rig???
2828 2018-11-30 19:30:00 Why don't they charge for this fuel as they do oil?
2829 2018-11-30 19:29:56 Only bad part is they’re closed Sunday’s!
2830 2018-11-30 19:29:47 I dont have oil brah,what should i improvise with ? 
2831 2018-11-30 19:29:42 oil change: are you getting enough sleep and managing stress?
engine air filter:  are you taking slow, deep breaths?
serpentine belt: ensure that what makes you passionate is helping you day to day
transmission: make sure you have a system for converting ideas & goals into action
2832 2018-11-30 19:29:41 Yess, coconut oil is the besttt for dryness. I have cold pressed pure coconut oil, and I haven't seen anything better than that!
2833 2018-11-30 19:29:35 Ya ya it was better for Congress as in UPA era #INC has done, 2G scan, KoyLa scam, Radia tapes, NSEL Scam, helicopter scandal, Maharashtra stamp duty scam, haryana forest scam, Hasan Ali scam, Oil for food scam-K. Natwar Singh had to resign. Nothing happen in MODI era...
2834 2018-11-30 19:29:35 This sounds exactly like what the socialists proposed before taking control of Venezuela's oil production.
2835 2018-11-30 19:29:35 There are oil wells in AK, AL, AR, AZ, CA, CO, FL, ID, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MI, MO, MS, MT, ND, NE, NM, NV, NY, OH, OK, OR, PA, SD, TN, UT, VA, WV & WY. Oh, and TX. Most of the people employed by this industry are responsible for the low prices. They likely do vote Republican.
2836 2018-11-30 19:29:34 @ancientminerals My favorite Magnesium Oil. Keep up the great work.
2837 2018-11-30 19:29:24 With Trump, it’s complete denial and he wants to rip apart any environmental regulation he can. We can’t drop oil overnight and at least with BO he acknowledged our impact. BO also supported advancing and subsidizing cleaner energy options instead of older and dirtier options.
2838 2018-11-30 19:29:13 Oil & Gas bros
2839 2018-11-30 19:29:08 oil

2841 2018-11-30 19:29:05 As a national leader, he's helpless. There's a protocol to be followed.

Everyone needs Oil.

There's no concrete evidence yet presented.

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY....
No one messes with the Oil Mafia. Even the US President is scared of them.

2847 2018-11-30 19:28:50 Things like this make me miss being gainfully employed. 

Instead of receiving rice and vegetable oil and bonuses, I am the one doing the giving
2848 2018-11-30 19:28:44 We still need oil Claire so why aren’t you supporting home grown companies currently drilling around Gatwick so we also reduce our imports #ukog
2849 2018-11-30 19:28:32 How did we get here with a monopoly on power the conservatives had the best years with the oil and gas industry - all that was done was tax cuts - spending run uncontrollably versus managing as if that money was not there take a page from Norway which by the way has a carbon tax
2850 2018-11-30 19:28:29 Used to remember when Nigeria claimed
to be the giant of Africa now all we have
is crude oil and wizkid
2851 2018-11-30 19:28:14 what's the stain? Water, cleaning fluid, oil, perfume?
2852 2018-11-30 19:28:06 VLCCs operate on the same crew as smaller ships, and require about the same amount of fuel and carry 4x as much oil. Ergo cost for shipping via smaller tankers, the ones being phased out, is about 4x as much.
2853 2018-11-30 19:28:05 I hate getting my oil changed
2854 2018-11-30 19:28:03 Big Anything - Big Pharma, Big Government, Big Oil, Big Auto - fits that bill. They are like social collectives, screw everyone else as long as The Hive prospers and thrives.
2855 2018-11-30 19:28:03 $DWT 50 level on oil holding well. looking for this one to have a nice fade soon
2856 2018-11-30 19:27:58 Keep her on the oil. If it's keeping me alive it will keep Ruby alive!!! Keep fighting with me Ruby!!!
2857 2018-11-30 19:27:56 I’ve just popped back again for some Friday night shopping. Yet again heard the CBD oil people stretching the truth. “It’s good for any sort of inflammation or pain”. Can you tell me what steps you’ve taken to stop this mis-selling and what your next steps are please.
2858 2018-11-30 19:27:46 Wall Street's preference for "pure plays" certainly gets a lot of blame here. If one of the oil majors truly went all in on renewables, a great deal of the opposition would evaporate. But for entirely unrelated reasons the investor class hates companies doing stuff like that.
2859 2018-11-30 19:27:40 Oh man, that's too bad. The last trip to Lush was a great experience. But now that I know, I can't in good conscience go back. I support Canadian Oil Workers so that was my last time there
2860 2018-11-30 19:27:31 Fantastic piece of news.. These achievements are all well and good on terms of brand building but I seriously wish for a economical electric cars to be produced in bulk to reduce CO2 emissions and make India less dependant on oil..Cont..
2861 2018-11-30 19:27:28 Do they do fracking up there?  Lots of oil pumped out?
2862 2018-11-30 19:27:25 I had to sit through 20 minutes of  their drivel at the oil change place.  Only time I used them and, pretty sure I'm not going back.
2863 2018-11-30 19:27:24 11/30/2018 Baker-Hughes US Rig Count Total = -3 to 1,076, Oil +2 to 887, Gas -5 to 189, DIR = 68, HZ = 934, Vert = 74 (#RT)

2867 2018-11-30 19:26:49 Trump tax cuts were what got the stagnant economy going. All indisputable. With Obamacare, companies were laying workers off and placing them as part time because of the massive rise in premiums. Trump supports coal mining, oil exploration along with pipelines, Obama didn’t
2868 2018-11-30 19:26:39 my solution to everything: drink more water and use more coconut oil
2869 2018-11-30 19:26:27 I caught up on the oil drills but there's a startling lack of horses
2870 2018-11-30 19:26:20 Bill Clinton: "I did not have sex with Monica"
Al Gore: "I invented the Internet"
Hillary: "I didn't keep classified emails on that private server"
Obama: “America’s like the biggest oil producer and the biggest gas -- that was me, people.”

#Democrats are filthy liars.
2871 2018-11-30 19:26:18 If the KSA sides with Russia, oil prices will hit $150. If the KSA sides with the US, oil prices will drop under $30. The KSA is the country which balances the demands of both sides to ensure the stability of the market. What will happen if we pick a side? #CrownPrinceInG20
2872 2018-11-30 19:26:05 Billions in oil money if sanctions were lifted. The only change Trump made to the GOP platform.

2875 2018-11-30 19:25:44 She wants to talk trade with Argentina man, we’ll share the oil or leave it in the ground and demand Argentinians that come to the Falklands and Britain do so by quota. But in the Falklands they don’t get a settled vote over the Islands, but mixed race babies do. You only have to

2878 2018-11-30 19:25:31 Yeah. Macron threatened not to buy anymore Saudi oil, instead the pint size leader will buy it from Iran and Russia.  I meant this as a joke, not news.
2879 2018-11-30 19:25:29 GOP ballooned the debt, cut healthcare and screwed the working class for tax cuts for the 1%. No amount of lies will obscure that you don’t work for Coloradans. Take your NRA, Insurance company and Oil blood money and #gettheBuckout #GOPlies #resist #taxscam

2881 2018-11-30 19:25:21 Sadly most Americans seem to have short term memory loss. The Obama Administration created sevearal National Monuments taking Millions of acres of public land from the people, it was also a direct attack at Farming, Ranching and the Oil Industry. #WalkAwayFromDemocrats
2882 2018-11-30 19:25:07 I need to go get an oil change but I rather nap.
2883 2018-11-30 19:25:05 The Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Dr Maikanti Baru, has described the nation’s oil company as the most open and transparent government-owned corporate entity.
2884 2018-11-30 19:25:00 Remember when Pokémon Go was like how CBD oil is now??
2885 2018-11-30 19:24:43 Yeah, I mostly drink water, iced tea, and diet soda. Had to cut all white starch

2891 2018-11-30 19:24:18 Saudi  Arabia is aiming to cut oil production in order to boost prices, but  the recent vote by the U.S. Senate to end the war in Yemen, even if it doesn’t become law, heightens the pressure on Riyadh to assuage American  concerns.
2892 2018-11-30 19:24:18 Of course - they're the new "oil coalition". 

(... all we need is Israel and we'd have both Trump Tower conspiracy meetings too.)
2893 2018-11-30 19:24:06 @CNN @cnnbrk @CNNnewsroom Any reports of oil & gas infrastructure damage?

2895 2018-11-30 19:23:57 @checks get my head around why Oil Services is down more than Crude and even more than the XOP which I would think should be lower.
2896 2018-11-30 19:23:55 So importing oil from any other country is better than using Canadian oil?
2897 2018-11-30 19:23:53 That’s the secret handshake for weapons deals & buying oil in rubles.
2898 2018-11-30 19:23:50 Apples and oranges. Standard oil was THE ONLY place you buy oil in 1911
This chart shows there are alternatives to google search people just don’t use them.
2899 2018-11-30 19:23:36 Thanks!! I’ve never been to Alaska so I’m not familiar with the geology of the area either. I’m going on personal experience from living in north Texas during the fracking discovery/oil & gas boom. Suddenly we started having earthquakes. Bizarre coincidence?
2900 2018-11-30 19:23:27 It's already been proven. Keshe applies at all levels of scientific applications. What is great is that it is simple and simulates planets and the local level. Yeah Bitcoin is useless in a oil based society we'd kill the planet with it.

2903 2018-11-30 19:23:23 Stop buying Saudi’s oil, start building refineries and pipelines

2906 2018-11-30 19:22:55 Many  members of the OPEC+ coalition want Saudi Arabia to do all of the heavy  lifting when it comes to production cuts. they argue, Saudi Arabia was the one that added 1 million barrels per day of supply. The Saudis “made this mess. They need to clean it up,” -oil official
2907 2018-11-30 19:22:49 "That would mean wind, solar, biomass and geothermal are in, while coal, natural gas, oil and nuclear power are completely out."

2910 2018-11-30 19:22:27 It’s in correlation to the the price (supply & demand) in the states and refining capacity in Canada. The producers here with refinery’s in the states are making a killing in the states taking that $17 oil selling it at a loss pay no tax here.
2911 2018-11-30 19:22:25 Ireland raises around £300 billion. Without oil etc.
2912 2018-11-30 19:22:21 You're also assuming that any new oil and gas offshore will be no.1 found & no.2 will be given to the State. There's a 1 in 32 chance of finding anything and it's privatized. Any Irish gas is going on an LNG tanker to Europe, not Ireland. What company would risk another Corrib?

Where are the solutions for these basic problems? Why won’t most companies employ PHDs?
2917 2018-11-30 19:21:39 I only use clean burning renewable whale oil.
2918 2018-11-30 19:21:39 What about some CBD oil of some sort?
2919 2018-11-30 19:21:38 A better start would be to get The President's lips extracted from Putin's azz.  And then take a bone saw to that Prince so he knows how it felt. And as always, it's all about the oil. #KochsSuck
2920 2018-11-30 19:21:33 Riyadh  faces a choice between accepting painfully low oil prices or defying  Washington by cutting production. Reports suggest they are going to try  to thread the needle, opting for modest cuts that at least put a floor  beneath crude prices.
2921 2018-11-30 19:21:30 E pass normal, he's never considerate or objective.
2922 2018-11-30 19:21:18 Trump ready to trade Aid for more oil.

2933 2018-11-30 19:20:23 Most of them are flushing their excrement into the strait & ocean they pretend 2 be protecting. Thousands of cruise ships, barges, Alaskan oil tankers, ferries sail these waters each yr with NO objection.  Only Alta oil tankers would ruin the water.
CUT OFF ALBERTA OIL TO B.C!
2934 2018-11-30 19:20:22 Oil companies tend to lay back and new fields are not developed if Russia limits production , so in the long run companies should have an incentive to increase production
2935 2018-11-30 19:20:16 The fashion industry brings more revenue into the UK coffers than North Sea oil and gas. But why let facts get in the way of headline grabbing by Ofsted!!!  #ArtStillMatters

2937 2018-11-30 19:20:06 So then I take it you want 1: A carbon tax 2: no oil pipe lines let’s just stick to fuel burning trains and truck transport 3:removing gas cars from the roads , and do on and so forth? Just asking as you seem to be a staunch Liberal in your views toward this stuff
2938 2018-11-30 19:20:05 Yup! I sprinkle a lil rosehip seed oil in mine too

2943 2018-11-30 19:19:40 If the Liberals in California allowed all of their big beautiful water to flow to the sea, it would have gone to Alaska where it, along with careful raking and removing enough oil from the ground, blocked by DEMS!, could have stopped this!

Iceland toffee cheesecake contains palm oil the fact you sell other items with palm oil is hypocritical!

2951 2018-11-30 19:19:03 Gas & oil run out. We're only energy secure if our energy demand is low & our energy is renewable. 2,800 people die a year from energy poverty. How much did the State spend on (failing to) protect Shell's profits in Corrib? Imagine if we'd spent that on making warm homes?
2952 2018-11-30 19:19:02 Why would the start building TMX when they are going to ban the tankers needed to accept the oil at the coast? They bought it to ensure it wouldn’t get built.
2953 2018-11-30 19:18:56 oh!イル
2954 2018-11-30 19:18:52 Pemex  more than tripled the estimate reserve figure for its Ixachi field,  saying the field in Veracruz could now hold 1.3 billion barrels of oil  equivalent in proven, probable and possible (3P) reserves. will allow Pemex to contribute with more production in  the future
2955 2018-11-30 19:18:41 Pretty sure the Saudis are keeping the price of oil low. But go on.

2970 2018-11-30 19:17:23 You must be so proud of this outcome. Did you have it planned from the start? 

Shutting down production would do the same thing. Industry will not continue to employ workers if they aren’t producing oil. 

You and Harper kept all the eggs in one basket, 1 customer.
2971 2018-11-30 19:17:20 Considering how Norway has managed its oil revenues closely mirrors what Lougheed wanted to do here, and they are in a much better position to weather a storm, I'll take DS over crony capitalism any day of the week.

2979 2018-11-30 19:16:55 Not getting my hopes up over this "Green New Deal" because the GOP are still filled with climate change deniers and too many Democrats still take oil, gas, and coal money.
2980 2018-11-30 19:16:50 Oil  prices for Western Canada Select (WCS) are trading below $15 per  barrel, inflicting pain on the entire sector. Oilfield services  companies in Alberta are issuing layoffs as activity slows down. note that drilling activity has fallen by 10 per cent  #oil
2981 2018-11-30 19:16:49 $SPY NEW HIGH coming! #OIL
2982 2018-11-30 19:16:47 So old campaign, and some interesting perspectives have been released on the price differentials that suggest the problem isn’t the lack of pipelines or transport at all, it’s much better quality oil being accessible and extracted at high volumes in the US at the moment.
2983 2018-11-30 19:16:42 it was so long ago, I think it did but it’s really quick, just make sure you take care of it w/ warm water, non-iodized salt & tea tree oil bc mine got a lil affected at one point but I still kept it in & let it heal  I think the healing process is worse

2986 2018-11-30 19:16:27 I think that's probably got something to do with Americans dashing to develop tight oil fields, encouraged by the high prices of oil back then.
2987 2018-11-30 19:16:27 Stop their oil from coming to Canada
2988 2018-11-30 19:16:23 Making some hair oil next week 
2989 2018-11-30 19:16:17 So how many have you knocked off this week
Not as much as you did
Screw the rest of these shisters they our gas oil and money
2990 2018-11-30 19:16:16 @YourOilyMum hello thanks for connecting- quick question- what oil can I use on warts on my hands? Had them 20 yrs so frustrating . Ta Andy
2991 2018-11-30 19:16:13 Check your Engine oil today.
2992 2018-11-30 19:16:11 Olive Oil in vetro in partenza!
destinazione Dallas TEXAS
2993 2018-11-30 19:16:11 I love how people think this is an exaggeration. I guess they’ve never seen “I know scientists overwhelmingly agree that climate change is man made and is having catastrophic effects on the environment, but let’s hear the perspective of this oil lobbyist” on tv.
2994 2018-11-30 19:16:00 Spectre's Large Cup O' Chili oil, now with Pico de gallo 'n' Pesto
2995 2018-11-30 19:15:58 وفاء يامحمود وفاء
يعني مثلا واحد عنده حالة وفاء
2996 2018-11-30 19:15:45 And the execs all said of course David we won't bother doing our jobs and making money  because oil execs are famous for caring about more than money
2997 2018-11-30 19:15:44 That's the worst because it's enough to slick up the road oil, but not enough to wash it away.
2998 2018-11-30 19:15:44 Exactly I didnt like how I was when I was on it but I was in so much pain kinda scary being dependent then cbd oil worked wonders for me with no side affects & I cancelled all my refills. The culture is weird when it comes to pain. Our bodies are stronger than we give credit
2999 2018-11-30 19:15:42 Has anyone gotten their oil changed at Walmart cause I’m about to go for the first time
3000 2018-11-30 19:15:40 absolute stupidity . oil is in the dumps. no one needs to drill for more of it. the world has plenty
3001 2018-11-30 19:15:36 Yes, 'climate action' is working and about to get much better.  Let's see: Alberta oil destroyed, energy poverty for the poor on the way, foreign investment in ALL aspects of the economy resulting in no commercial activity and therefore no POLLUTION!
3002 2018-11-30 19:15:33 Oil  prices dipped in early trading, but the next few days will be volatile.  First, any news from the G20 summit on the Trump-Xi meeting regarding  the trade war could have ramifications for the global economy and oil  demand heading into 2019
3003 2018-11-30 19:15:33 Remove all sanctions on Russia which has crippled their economy. I believe there’s a plan for drilling oil in arctic too-Rosnef ??
3004 2018-11-30 19:15:28 @BrookeBCNN what about the oil pipeline?
3005 2018-11-30 19:15:18 Dropped of my car at @Midas at 7:30 this morning for an oil change and 7 hours later and it’s still not ready. Great job guys. Keep up the good work.
3006 2018-11-30 19:15:06 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
3007 2018-11-30 19:15:01 MBS seems happy like a calf on green beech, even when meeting with Macron. It can't be the oil price, so maybe because Trump and apparently even Putin has his back.
3008 2018-11-30 19:14:54 What about the AMERICAN SMALL OIL COMPANIES? You know, your constituents, who actually voted for you and helped you get elected?
3009 2018-11-30 19:14:51 Surely you are kidding or just wearing your leftie stripes on your sleeves.  There is no way Alberta is doing better now than previously.  Doesn't look to me like oil is dying anywhere - we just have anti-oil people in power that we have to eject come next elections.
3010 2018-11-30 19:14:51 Wtf with the oil and gas!
3011 2018-11-30 19:14:26 Oil related?
3012 2018-11-30 19:14:19 The only oil that should be drizzled on salad is olive oil
3013 2018-11-30 19:14:17 Old finnish proverb: russki is a  russki, even if you fry him in oil" Did you know influenza was called "Russian flu" before word influenza was invented. Cockroaches are called Raasakka in Finland. Little russians
3014 2018-11-30 19:14:01 Definitely. His hate for pmb is at that level
3015 2018-11-30 19:14:00 Boiling in oil.
3016 2018-11-30 19:13:37 Are we still wasting taxpayer $ for oil paintings if serving members?  Last I heard was $75,000+ for each portrait. Fine to preserve President & First Lady, but don’t need them for everyone else.
3017 2018-11-30 19:13:36 God bless you for the question,I will use it to buy quarter bag of rice,2 litres of groundnut oil, Plastic of garri and satchet of tomatoes and Maggie and that is it for the year and for my family
3018 2018-11-30 19:13:36 Agreed. 
It shouldn't be. If someone is qualified for the job, then that's what should be looked at, not if they are male or female.
Heck, there are women working in the oil and gas industry stringing pipe and in the facility construction field. 
They handle a wrench just fine.
3019 2018-11-30 19:13:33  zomi oil kill me
Some CREED II level o
3020 2018-11-30 19:13:32 Please if you feel like it I just put castor oil on them 
3021 2018-11-30 19:13:26 Finished and for sale at The Hub on Canal:  "Lovers on the Brooklyn Bridge" 11 x 14 oil  There's not a place on the planet like NYC!  and I so loved doing this painting.  It really looked like this the day we were there.
3022 2018-11-30 19:13:23 Well, okie dokie. Come on out here & drive on our SoCal roads & freeways next time it rains (of course you may have to wait a year). You'd be shocked at how slippery they are when accumulated road oil gets wet. I lived in Swiss Alps for 10 yrs, so I know how to drive in snow, too
3023 2018-11-30 19:13:05 @MSNBC @maddow When you increase fracking you increase the chances for earthquakes it’s a proven scientific fact and Alaska has been increasing production for the past year trying to get over 5 billion gallons of oil.
3024 2018-11-30 19:13:02 So I thought I had heard everything but now the Drumpf administration is going to aloud sonic booms in the oceans that will kill whales and dolphins. Of course for his oil buddies. #Evil
3025 2018-11-30 19:12:50 Oil a y3ky3 de3 #Menpe but I will think about it
3026 2018-11-30 19:12:45 Soap does that for me! And for waterproof stuff, oil first ...
3027 2018-11-30 19:12:29 my favorite nicoise in the city is not traditional, but it comes with salmon cooked medium, egg, potatoes, green beans, beets, capers, lettuce, oil

my chef ex-roommate told me it was heresy to do it without at least one anchovy
3028 2018-11-30 19:12:26 i need to get an oil change today
3029 2018-11-30 19:12:25 I don’t watch it. You only need to watch the last 2 minutes if you don’t have to do an oil/filter change.
3030 2018-11-30 19:12:23 I feel like using lip oil is better than usuing lip chap because those conspiracies about lip chap drying out your lips so you buy more sound CONVINCING but oils just oil so nothing happens really uwu
3031 2018-11-30 19:12:22 Saudis are smart. Pam’s ex-Army chief is their security advisor. No amount of Modi will turn that fact away. 

And we buy oil from Iran.
3032 2018-11-30 19:12:16 I don’t see how that contradicts my tweet.  There *is* more money to be made defending has and oil than studying actual climate change.  And there *is* a disinenuity to defending gas  and oil interests while telling scientists outside climatology to stay in their lane.
3033 2018-11-30 19:11:57 No it was Scotland's Future.
Perhaps you can tell me how Scotland would have avoided going for a bailout to the IMF with a £42B shortfall in prjected oil revenues?
Dodged a massive bullet with these con artists.
3034 2018-11-30 19:11:54 Do they offer CBD Oil massages at the spa? 

If not, they should
3035 2018-11-30 19:11:53 Is the busy season making it difficult for your child to get the rest they need? Prior to a nap or bedtime, apply Marjoram essential oil to your child’s feet. The calming properties of Marjoram oil will help soothe the child, helping him or her to rest easily and peacefully.
3036 2018-11-30 19:11:49 How about oil pan full of used diesel oil
3037 2018-11-30 19:11:47 that snake oil sounds p nice right about now

3040 2018-11-30 19:11:34 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
3041 2018-11-30 19:11:27 I could be wrong, but I don’t think you’re supposed to eat motor oil
3042 2018-11-30 19:11:22 Obama never heard Shell Oil CEO tell him he was full of **it!
3043 2018-11-30 19:11:21 Being a Trump supporter and a non-English speaking immigrant goes together like oil and water
3044 2018-11-30 19:11:17 Agreed , but we did a lot for USA ,see the price of oil as per trump and his nation expectation . We help USA to stop terrorism . Obama has support Qater agenda against Saudi .and they support Muslims brotherhood and radical Islam want us to be in darkness to be easy to blackmail
3045 2018-11-30 19:11:16 Jeki uyakwazi ukuthi icooking oil yi $9
3046 2018-11-30 19:11:08 He had no plan to try to bring back jobs just put more out of business using his climate change message to do it....now he is the Oil/coal King according to himself he did it all! He is a big fat liar who  weakened us Militarily & economically while sending Enemies money&uranium
3047 2018-11-30 19:11:05 [Apologies for vain tweet!]

I am 40 weeks pregnant tomorrow and I have found my first stretch marks TODAY! I really thought my moisturiser/oil regime was working to prevent them and I am irrationally annoyed by this late development...
3048 2018-11-30 19:11:04 I hate the guy with passion, I suspect na Shi'ite
3049 2018-11-30 19:11:04 't vote for anyone with Muslim Brotherhood ties, ISIS ties, Hamas ties, and who hates native Canadians. Who bankrupts the economy, destroys the dollar, supports foreign oil, hands out foreign aid to human rights violators, fills his foundation with 'pay for play',...

3051 2018-11-30 19:11:00 On the name of Peace initially Disturbances will create internally & after that they will enter into that Country for to bring Peace. On the name of peace thet will create war between Rebels & Govt only. Few Countrys will get 2 benefits by this..controlling Oil & selling Weapons.
3052 2018-11-30 19:10:53 I currently smell like a cocktail of Vix Vapour Rub and Olbas Oil. Yummy! Yay for winter illness 
3053 2018-11-30 19:10:48 @MeghanMcCain .the oil there is a great place in California called " Aunt Zelda's House" the lady who started this is Mara Gordon...Namaste
3054 2018-11-30 19:10:29 You know you're supposed to change the oil and not just top it off everytime right
3055 2018-11-30 19:10:28 Ordinary palm oil that  poured on my shirt, I'm still yet to recover from the slap
3056 2018-11-30 19:10:28 Yes! Restore the VRA. When all votes are counted, when all voting is easy, democracy wins. Oil oligarchs lose their influence. We the people have control. Thanks in no small part to Nancy Pelosi. And strong Senators like Claire McCaskill.
3057 2018-11-30 19:10:26 I want someone to tell trump that this is what happens when you take too much oil from the ground, the plates get too sticky and don't glide along easily like they should.
3058 2018-11-30 19:10:14 He's overdoing it
3059 2018-11-30 19:10:10 The pipeline that is currently conveying oil and returning $200 million per year. That one? Or the one the ineptitude of the previous government and its attempt at consultation with First Nation caused to stall? Hard to know what Albertans want to bitch about these days.
3060 2018-11-30 19:10:10 Left work. Land Rover felt odd. Turned round and did and emergency diff oil change in the dark on a wet car park floor. Not exactly what I needed on a Friday evening.
3061 2018-11-30 19:10:03 オススメデッキください #lov3 #lovfan
3062 2018-11-30 19:10:02 We are on the edge and can not ignore science any longer, we have to stop letting the corporations, coal and oil dictate policy based on profit. We MUST do something now before we reach the point of no return on climate.
3063 2018-11-30 19:09:55 My lola at 3am while I'm putting some shit bio oil on my face 

"Aalis ka ba???!!!" 

At 3am reallyy???? Ma!!! Kakauwi ko lang!!! Hahahahahaa pokpok nanaman,,,,???!! Hahahahaha
3064 2018-11-30 19:09:48 Absolutely!  That's why we need a #GreenNewDeal.  Another immediate action that would have an impact us ending all subsidies for fossil fuels.  Will you commit to being against fossil fuel subsidies and corporate tax loopholes for Big Oil?
3065 2018-11-30 19:09:41 Have you tried CBD oil? It’s the gold non high one and it’s brilliant! Can really help with all sorts of pain!
3066 2018-11-30 19:09:39 Diminishing our foreign oil dependence to streamline domestic clean energy investment (firms “switching” from oil to clean) + Paris agreement is certainly political but “furthering the end of human civilization” is a stretch. Obama is not Carter or Reagan in net env. loss
3067 2018-11-30 19:09:33 How long before you and the Goofy Liberals blame it on "climate change" or the oil and gas industry?
3068 2018-11-30 19:09:21 Yes we can and a progressive liberal @DNC can oppose the GOP and the influence oil money has bought in politics. #BeAboutChange
3069 2018-11-30 19:09:19 The attack politics of this company do not fit my personal ethics.  These idiots are a bunch of hypocrites! They’ll take our “dirty oil money” but advocate against the pipelines!!
3070 2018-11-30 19:09:19 sharp!! make the Oil some reach my top for here 

3071 2018-11-30 19:09:18 This is a welcome development but I think the numbers have bn blown out of proportion with no picture evidence, even army with their sophistication dont record this kind of neutralization in a single ops.
3072 2018-11-30 19:09:13 ...and how much does that american oil cost to get out of the ground?
3073 2018-11-30 19:09:00 There’s always a local snake oil clinic: my one has a therapeutic MRI machine and will throw more adjunct than you can shake a stick at ( or your wallet will allow...) 
3074 2018-11-30 19:08:55 The palm oil?
3075 2018-11-30 19:08:45 Simon sinek can fuck off. As well as the other self help types. snake oil peddlers of the digital age.
3076 2018-11-30 19:08:45 Interesting. God is pretty clever with oil lamps. And dumb as a fence post about Nazi's. An American Jew here simply dumbfounded at modern Jewry's bolstering of miracle belief.
3077 2018-11-30 19:08:36 Brian Pallister calls on feds to reduce trade barriers, talks of changing oil and gas royalty regime in MB. First Minister meet next week. Full story coming in a mo'  #mbpoli
3078 2018-11-30 19:08:16 Haha! Who woulda thought! They can also take capsules of CBD oil to skip the taste too!

3081 2018-11-30 19:08:02 “Yeah hi I’m here for an oil change” 

*5 hours later*
3082 2018-11-30 19:08:02 Impossible. A person who uses subtitles would never fraternize with a scamp who doesn’t use them. It’s like oil and water.
3083 2018-11-30 19:07:58 Having to get an oil change is annoying
3084 2018-11-30 19:07:55 Oil companies: You should take on the central bankers. Floating-rate currencies obscure supply/demand imbalances, exacerbating severity. The fulcrum of commerce -- currencies -- should be fixed, not floating, so you can better manage supply/demand swings.
3085 2018-11-30 19:07:42 Made myself an acne drying lotion and an oil moisturizer. Hope i dont ruin my face lol
3086 2018-11-30 19:07:41 I have the impression that the #Saudis are pumping more #Oil out of concern that their government will be overthrown
3087 2018-11-30 19:07:25 Yet oil is still negative on the day. What's the market looking for, 1.8Mb/d?
3088 2018-11-30 19:07:24 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.
3089 2018-11-30 19:07:17 やったぜ！
3090 2018-11-30 19:07:14 As if a carbon tax is the answer to climate change. The US military is the number one consumer of oil on earth@and the number contributor to green house gases. We have to stop dancing around the problem.
3091 2018-11-30 19:07:11 How about Tariffs on foreign produced oil? Aren’t AMERICAN, small business, domestic, onshore companies derserving of the same opportunity afforded to auto manufacturers who just turn on us? If the crude oil purchasing companies don’t want to pay Tarriffs, why not buy AMERICAN?
3092 2018-11-30 19:07:07 Avocado! Because it's in everything anymore and since avocado oil is a natural form of latex I'm allergic to so many things I want to try :(

3102 2018-11-30 19:06:01 @POTUS will blame the Alaska earthquake on the oil making the earth slide, then he'll blame the dems for not allowing it all to be pumped out. He will announce he will save Alaska by letting the oil companies pump out all the scary dangerous oil & then laugh at stupid scientists
3103 2018-11-30 19:06:00 And free up rail cars for oil, other things. There are a zillion reasons why Trans Mountain should get it done.
3104 2018-11-30 19:05:59 @maxeffortmuscle has great CBD oil
3105 2018-11-30 19:05:57 And HID from voters at NO SHOW Town Hall events. Arrogance and Corruption. Good riddance. We live America. Sad to say, it is doubtful you do. Now slink back to run you oil Co. Littleton Oil.

Show you real motive , it's like US attack on Iraq for Oil saying they are fighting to save democracy.
3112 2018-11-30 19:05:10 Russias ALWAYS seeking 2 cause distance between USA & her allies, 2 fill the void. If 45 cant maintain USAs historic relations w/Saudis, it could spur USA becoming world leader N green NRG development (as oil access could B lessened). BAD time &BAD 4 Chump 2 tick off NATO allies!

3114 2018-11-30 19:05:04 @CNWGroup WHAT GIVES??? Why is it that you're standing against Alberta? The importing of conflict oil & the resulting crippling of the Alberta/Canadian ecomomy is a SERIOUS ISSUE, and your job is to report the news, NOT to decide what is and what is not "NEWS". #cdnpol
3115 2018-11-30 19:04:54 I use it daily everynight before i sleep, and i just use pure argan oil, nothing added to it, i find it most affective like that
3116 2018-11-30 19:04:50 Vaccines are completely safe just make sure you get single dose vaccines because what was dangerous was the medium they were using it has mercury in it now they're mostly using peanut oil or sunflower oil but if you have more than one vaccine in a shot that use the Mercury stuff
3117 2018-11-30 19:04:37 Or between them they can lower supply and raise the price of oil that way. Putin would much prefer to insert Russia into the void Trunt has left in the M.E.
3118 2018-11-30 19:04:36 Get your own stash JOE! we taking this oil anally! 
3119 2018-11-30 19:04:25 I think it's a India's compulson to have very good relation with Saudi s as 
1 Saudi belong to US group
2 India has huge muslim population 3 India's problems with Pak ..including Kashmir  
4 Saudis have a high influence in OIC...nd India is a huge importer of crude oil from gulf

3124 2018-11-30 19:04:05 Norway is a small economy with a huge oil and gas sector. The UK has a far bigger economy massively dependent on services. What is good for Norway, would not be good for the UK, and we would be surrendering vastly more power in the EU than Norway could ever obtain.
3125 2018-11-30 19:03:54 As smart as global warming is from oil and gas
3126 2018-11-30 19:03:51 It does not matter Where you stand to take a picture, but most importantly, you are among the G20's most powerful countries in the world. Saudi Arabia has the world's largest oil reserves and controls its price.

3135 2018-11-30 19:03:17 Omg all the posts that are saying not to support Lush kill me. Like I get we are in Alberta but can we just for a second try to acknowledge the ecological footprint oil extraction/production/transportation leaves and that MAYBE renewable energy is worth putting more money in to!?
3136 2018-11-30 19:03:15 Who is this Jamal?  Can the world be held hostage by a TV station which has Israel kagshogi  as the news day in day out?  Sanction Saudi Iran,  oil will be cheap @ $ 300per barrel.

TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS RUDY GIULIANI IS A VERY BIG LIAR, AS WHEN HE REMOVED JOANNA ANIELLO FROM HOUSING PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT AND PLACED HER IN CHARGE OF THE NEW YORK HOUSING AUTHORITY AFTER SHE NEARLY GOT CAUGHT DEALING WITH OIL VENDORS

3150 2018-11-30 19:01:48 With cars, the analogy would be build your own car, and while your at it, define the oil into gasoline. 
Also, you'll never be able to buy a car without seeing the wondowsticker,  because you don't know if the parts are harmful or not.

3160 2018-11-30 19:00:51 Saudi Arabia has been pretty much nice with Russia in the last years: both have engineered oil production cuts thus making oil prices rebound. Both have earned a lot of money since then, which has helped sanctions-embattled Russia a lot. Why shouldn't they embrace each other?
3161 2018-11-30 19:00:47 You produce and sell as much oil as Saudi Arabia but can’t build stadiums? Raaaah corruption is mad

3172 2018-11-30 19:00:12 Got it's wealth in the past no one is making money on oil now.With half the oil production of Canada Norway has a surplus of $1 trillion largest surplus in the world Canada needs $250 billion to clean up the abandoned oil wells.why Norway owns the oil & and Canada gets $3 /barrel

3181 2018-11-30 18:59:49 One thing I haven't seen on this thread: Russia wants price of oil up, therefore he needs Iran forbidden from selling theirs. With Trump, you get Bolton, thus no Iranian oil.
And they want to keep Crimea, so they get a way to ship oil. With HRC, that wasn't gonna happen.

3194 2018-11-30 18:58:12 Putin is the most strategic leader of our time. Saudi Arabia is now recognises Russia as the new leader of the oil producing nations. Putin was able to achieve this by not pretending to be outraged or morally superior, he’s only interested in advancing Russian interests.
3195 2018-11-30 18:58:12 cant be backward looking at ET's coverage when oil dropped by 35%

3196 2018-11-30 18:58:11 Why are we doing seismic tests for future oil/gas drilling.... Fossil fuels are out dated. Get a clue, stop trying to keep a dying industry going. Retool and retrain your people for green energy! Save the earth & peep will step up and use your services!

3210 2018-11-30 18:56:54 Yes, as long as you don't include the cost of the EUR not unseating the USD's status: Hocking US mfg to China in order to fund the Global War on Terror & shift pricing of Iraqi oil back to USD.  Seems like it's been a penny wise, pound foolish strategy

3213 2018-11-30 18:56:18 I'm not an engineer or a scientist, but wouldn't additional drilling for oil have some sort of role or initiating an earthquake? Are we ravaging the land at our own peril?

3218 2018-11-30 18:55:37 It’s a good thing that chick fil a opened right beside Valvoline. Now whenever I can’t decide if I want a chicken sandwich, or an oil change, I won’t have to chose!
3219 2018-11-30 18:55:35 You want to pay $150 bl Oil!
3220 2018-11-30 18:55:27 I hate going to get an oil change by myself because these men really be thinking I’m clueless about cars . I mean I am but you ain’t bout to treat me that way  .
3221 2018-11-30 18:55:24 Don't dispute anything you are saying. I have been in on those discussions too as a small business owner and CPA.  But what kind of help should Canada provide that will not dig the climate change hole deeper for all of us? I'm in favour of supporting Alberta but not the oil sands
3222 2018-11-30 18:55:24 Which goes to show why Trump has to mitigate his outrage over the brutality, stupidity, & incompetence of the Kashoggi murder, & behave like a President because a key ally & the country that sets Global oil prices is at stake. Congress can play games. Trump knows what’s at stake.
3223 2018-11-30 18:55:23 World oil prices have dropped so its nothing these idiots have done about. The fuel formula would have lowered it even more.

3226 2018-11-30 18:55:17 Aha! No mention of oil revenues
3227 2018-11-30 18:55:11 In the 1970s when the price of crude oil quadrupled post 1973. Nothing to do with British Rail. Today's malaise is certainly because of the incompetent parasites who were gifted the railways by the Major Gov't. The sooner they're back in public hands the better.
3228 2018-11-30 18:55:07 Billion dollar trade handshakes. Weapons for oil and cash.
3229 2018-11-30 18:55:05 No where did I say we were able to cut oil off completely. I don’t burn my oil based products like computers, but I drive a smaller fuel efficient car. When tech becomes available I will certainly switch. I am merely pointing out that we need to do this to save the future.
3230 2018-11-30 18:54:58 We are spending $3 Billion on a wall, already in the budget.

It's a sea wall to protect Exxon from the effects of Global Warming.

3231 2018-11-30 18:54:53 Yeah but it makes going to war with America against oil nations a lot more...difficult

3240 2018-11-30 18:53:54 Why not say what you really mean @theresa_may . You value our oil, our whisky and all our other resources. You value that we stupidly voted to remain in 2014. You don't value our opinions or the will of the Scottish people or Holyrood. #DissolveTheUnion #Brexshit #feart
3241 2018-11-30 18:53:44 Of course it’s real but the impact your proclaiming isn’t the end of the world. Nature evens itself out. People blame hurricanes, tornadoes, forest fires on people (well some forest fires yes lol). I’ll work an oil rig if puts food on my table.

원:그래도 출판만화 형식으로 해야 단행본 낼때 다시 안 그릴 수 있다고~!
나:아니 단행본 안 낸다고ㅠㅠ
3250 2018-11-30 18:53:07 Who is looking for the best quality CBD oil? (NOT) spam
3251 2018-11-30 18:53:05 Just remind 2008 then tell me who is better
Oil prices highest  in international market but 100 / litre. Dollar rate he controlled.  Salaries increased 
Kisan situation?
Pls Google and then pass comments pls
3252 2018-11-30 18:53:03 I like eggs, lemons, vinegar, dijon mustard, and routinely use vegetable oil .

But I'm not eating mayonnaise
3253 2018-11-30 18:52:43 It's probably the blood and oil of someone they ploughed through after tailgating them for miles.
3254 2018-11-30 18:52:41 Yeah, that’s why I was thinking about the hair stuff — I have some smoothing oil I buy from my hipster salon but it is SO EXPENSIVE and SMELLS SO GROSS
3255 2018-11-30 18:52:41 Way to go! Trudeau's big mouth high school debate team cabinet strikes again. Gee, what will happen if Saudi stops the oil into eastern Canada now that Trudeau killed Energy East and western Canada cant ship oil eastward?
3256 2018-11-30 18:52:39 Does this mean we can make ghee and coconut oil as primary oils for all kinds of cooking ?
3257 2018-11-30 18:52:30 I don't see solar panel factories springing up in edmonton, Grand Prairie or Fort Mac. It simply the "let them eat cake" mentality when folks talk about replacing the oil and gas industry with solar panels.
3258 2018-11-30 18:52:26 Swinney said they defense has had a great week of practice, said USC played very well on offense but they played poorly on defense, they've worked hard this week, expects Pitt to "check their oil" to see if they've fixed those issue.
3259 2018-11-30 18:52:26 And other than that, I really want to squeeze in my oil change before January.
3260 2018-11-30 18:52:23 U clearly have no idea what ur talking about. U can store electricity. There are 43 billion barrels in the Permian oil Basin. It costs much less to extract than oil sands oil. For decades tar sands oil will be too expensive to extract, during which time renewable will get better
3261 2018-11-30 18:52:21 14235437069 meter  number;  ndenderu,  limuru road, near Catholic Church or MS oil petrol station.
3262 2018-11-30 18:51:52 Also, we can all survive without bathbombs, very few of us can survive without oil.
3263 2018-11-30 18:51:50 Lush cosmetics is promoting shutting down oil sands while they sell us their garbage- I am no longer shopping at Lush!!! I will spend my $100 elsewhere!!
3264 2018-11-30 18:51:33 @NTB 2 hours for an oil change and an alignment, with an appointment, is totally unacceptable.
3265 2018-11-30 18:51:33 For dry skin, use a mixture of baby oil and epsom salt. Rub into skin then shower.
3266 2018-11-30 18:51:30 Leave oil bagri ! Let me know about thise 35 airports ! I challenge you for an open debate ! Game ?
3267 2018-11-30 18:51:30 Ms. David: pushing to repeal $130M in revenue bc the state is in a “better” financial position than previous years is why our state regularly finds deficit. You think oil is going up or down next year? According to Trump, down. Gas prices are lowest in years. Leave the tax alone!
3268 2018-11-30 18:51:23 助けを求める声を聞き

助けになる事を見極めて差し伸べる手は少なく
『助けてやるからありがたく思え』という態度がそこかしこ
『努力が足りぬ』と黙らせる拳また多し
『皆こうすれば助かる』と誘い招く何処ぞの神
代価を求める幽霊もまた

よのなかっていろんなのがいるんだねぇ
3269 2018-11-30 18:51:18 The Queen Of The Oil Shows is BACK!!!!
3270 2018-11-30 18:51:17 I'll name the impacts: They cause pipelines, flowing with oil, presumably. They cause economic growth in the area.
Some of them may cause issues but if someone gets groped it won't be because of the #pipeline construction, it will be because that particular guy is a #groper.
3271 2018-11-30 18:51:16 Someone should take all of Big three management for a field trip: make them sit in a BMW and change the oil on a Lexus. That show them how a quality sedan should be built...
3272 2018-11-30 18:51:09 I think his theory is - earthquake because Alaska is too full of oil and need to pump more out fast.
3273 2018-11-30 18:51:06 But you still need their oil again... and if gas prices goto 6.00 a gallon then it’s trumps fault lol
3274 2018-11-30 18:50:55 Yeah! Don’t we realize how much the onerous fracking rules and stopping the pipelines helped spur on the oil industry??
3275 2018-11-30 18:50:48 New Mexico's massive oil production and methane waste pollution make the state a disproportionate driver of climate change, which is why it's imperative that @XochforCongress and @repbenraylujan join @Deb4CongressNM and @sunrisemvmt and support the #GreenNewDeal
3276 2018-11-30 18:50:45 I tell @uber all the time, drivers can’t afford the gas at the current rate of pay. I bet he hasn’t changed the oil or bought new tires recently either.
3277 2018-11-30 18:50:41 He could raise the dollar value and get cheaper oil
3278 2018-11-30 18:50:41 I used cbd oil after surgery... didn’t need any pain meds at all...
3279 2018-11-30 18:50:28 I don't use a lot of skincare products cause most of them make me break out but I use this coconut oil serum every morning and night
3280 2018-11-30 18:50:24 Trump doesn't want Germany to depend on Russian gas and oil not because it's a problem for NATO but because he wants Germany to depend on US gas and oil #CrownPrinceIIInG20
3281 2018-11-30 18:50:16 Swear it looked like crude oil spills or tar moving down to the ocean. We’ve seen a lot...not quite that, ever.
3282 2018-11-30 18:50:16 If you use you know every body knows this oil on the land it like you never see an qarthquake that’s the problem you don’t put oil on the land yes did you know that just like raking the forest they drink water and very wet
3283 2018-11-30 18:50:14 #NP Pour the Oil by Joshua Rodgers on #KRGN_985FM @thejoshuarogers
3284 2018-11-30 18:50:11 So can one assume there will be oil leaking from pipelines
3285 2018-11-30 18:50:02 I haven’t had much luck with CBD oil. It didn’t agree with my stomach for some reason. But I have friends who swear by it - that it has changed their lives as far as being pain free. It’s worth a shot. Just make sure you get the real stuff. There’s a lot of knock-offs out there.
3286 2018-11-30 18:50:00 While we do need to diversify as a geologist I know it will be a long time before we run out. AB is a land locked province with a harsh climate and very little to offer to investors other than oil, so we should not be boycotting one thing that feeds us all.
3287 2018-11-30 18:49:40 getting an ad for some bougie “cannabis perfume oil” in case you want to smell like you just smoked weed without actually smoking weed
3288 2018-11-30 18:49:37 @HARRISFAULKNER Many oil pipelines in Alaska. Earthquakes can rupture pipelines. Try to find out if these pipelines are still intact.
3289 2018-11-30 18:49:26 It's crude oil
3290 2018-11-30 18:49:18 The Pacifica oil is just okay. Honestly Ulta had Pacifca on sale and I got a few things. I had to stop using their face wipes because my skin burned. But the oil does break up the makeup. And they have a nice sleeping mask. 

I have been using a Mizon snail cream that’s nice.
3291 2018-11-30 18:49:10 We spend 100 billion protecting the regions oil supplies. Let’s get renewables going and end dependence on this resource that has lead to so much corruption and violence.
3292 2018-11-30 18:49:03 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
3293 2018-11-30 18:48:56 Zara's account is definitely worth subscribing to. Zara usually posts every day sometimes videos more often cheeky pics. You always get a #mondaymotivation video which lasts 2-4 minutes and has a scenario which you can request eg. Oil, leather skirt, etc
3294 2018-11-30 18:48:56 I don’t understand why this is even a fight in Canada. The only thing we should be debating is how the government spends the money from the tax it collects from oil resources!
3295 2018-11-30 18:48:37 Can you check with OIL prices? If both OIL and currency moves up then it can cause havoc.
3296 2018-11-30 18:48:36 Oil well
3297 2018-11-30 18:48:29 She appreciate when I oil her body and then fuck her!oppps
3298 2018-11-30 18:48:28 @YPFoficial Que pasa con los precios del combustible. El WTI Oil está en U$50. Se dijo que el precio iba a ser internacional.
3299 2018-11-30 18:48:17 How bout the news talk about the article on oil spills and contaminated lands from pipelines bursting! God watch you! And talk about how science says world is fine I don't need uneducated people telling me or scaring me to rob my money for tax
3300 2018-11-30 18:48:15 Give me some weed butter and oil and we can make medicated everything
3301 2018-11-30 18:48:14 My Castor Oil finally arrived. Waves about to be shitting on everything

3304 2018-11-30 18:48:06 I came to get an oil change & this man is flirting w/ me  better give me that discount 
3305 2018-11-30 18:48:05 Thanks, first you are incorrect. Secondly, you just proved that Democratic Socialists are not Socialists.

1. 76.9% of all the land (Dry and Submerged) is owned by the Government in the US. We pull resources (mainly oil) out of submerged land, so this has to be incorporated.. 1/
3306 2018-11-30 18:48:02 So now the USA has a great plan to find more poisonous oil in the oceans that will at the same time kill off precious marine life.

Kill off ocean life to accelerate climate change?

Is there nothing more stupid than blind greed?

This must be stopped.
3307 2018-11-30 18:48:00 Shove it, it’s Scottish culture, Scottish oil, Scottish people that have been ripped off for generations. All you do is make silly wee rehearsed speeches thinking it makes you inspirational to Scotland. Maybot at your best, week and wobbly liar. #happystandrewsday

3313 2018-11-30 18:47:26 Virtually all of my industry left Ontario after first Nafta to US. Not coming back under this one. Products still flow in though from US now. Now less cars too. Less oil/gas, less steel, less aluminum, less lumber. Yes things are just damn wonderful Karina
3314 2018-11-30 18:47:24 The mechanic always gotta make a joke about how close my seat is to the steering wheel lmao just change the oil and shut up
3315 2018-11-30 18:47:18 Jesus! They would be screwed. 10% on oil exports.
3316 2018-11-30 18:47:11 What is CBD oil?
3317 2018-11-30 18:47:08 Unless of course someone steps up and fills the 500,000bpd gap, bringing oil price back down...
3318 2018-11-30 18:47:03 I can't wait till the FDA shuts down Modern Alternative Asshole's Plague Shanty! Her snake oil is so dangerous, & NOT made under sterile, measured, tested conditions!
3319 2018-11-30 18:46:56 .@GovernorTomWolf, existing natural gas operations in PA are spewing hundreds of thousands of tons of climate-warming methane. When will you control this potent climate pollutant from the oil and gas industry?
3320 2018-11-30 18:46:55 i stg men are so dumb. my couch is tufted velvet and my roomate always wears his clothes he had on the oil rig ON THE COUCH  and wears his shoes inside
3321 2018-11-30 18:46:51 Fixing oil prices?
3322 2018-11-30 18:46:45 Can’t even get an oil change w $40

3325 2018-11-30 18:46:26 hey girls, when ur dad tells u to go get ur oil checked. do it. i just broke down on the highway :)
3326 2018-11-30 18:46:15 It may have oil on the land.  :)
3327 2018-11-30 18:46:13 I use tea tree oil and it completely killed my acne. I also stopped wearing makeup and completely stopped washing my face  i know it sounds wierd but my skin isn’t oily anymore and it’s completely clear
3328 2018-11-30 18:46:12 we out here gettin an oil change
3329 2018-11-30 18:46:11 Then throw out you oil products and lead they way! That means all synthetic clothing, computers phones, not internet or Twitter. You want the luxuries of having oil but want to be on the bang wagon fuck Canada movement. Don’t state this but yet hold it in your hand! #Throwitout!
3330 2018-11-30 18:46:08 Norway gets its wealth from oil.
3331 2018-11-30 18:46:07 typo* In some states it is illegal if the product contains over .3% of CBD oil, if its not hemp CBD. Maybe hers is, but who knows. She list prices and not product info lol
3332 2018-11-30 18:46:03 I consider myself their prime target market: young working female in my twenties with consumer power to buy their expensive product. However I have a big problem with a company protesting Canadian oil while using petroleum in thier everyday business. Why AB & not other countries?

3339 2018-12-01 23:59:48 Why? Do you work for the fossil fuel industry? Exxon even admitted that it is real. You do realize we will be way behind in creating clean energy jobs so we can indulge the oil lobbyists who have convinced idiots like you to deny it. You are a FOOL. 
3340 2018-12-01 23:59:45 No Oil

3343 2018-12-01 23:59:24 Canada has its own ethical, highly regulated oil in case you forgot.

3345 2018-12-01 23:59:16 This issue is a sad part of Canada. However your source confirmed what I thought. It says nothing about construction or oil workers increasing the sex trade. It says our Aboriginal communities are broken and something needs to be done.
3346 2018-12-01 23:58:46 Actually quite the opposite - the days have been going well - I actually went 6 days this week - probably give it a rest 2morrow - but my energy and concentration and my mood were good - my mood was more stable then if I did eat.

3377 2018-12-01 23:57:50 かわ綺麗な黒猫さんですね。黒豆！
3378 2018-12-01 23:57:50 Yes, men buy prostitutes. People that control the prostitutes bring them places where there are lots of men with money. The assertion that it's something new or exclusive to the oil industry is false
3379 2018-12-01 23:57:43 Let's not forget that Bush senior was a huge piece of shit. Death squads in Latin-America, war for oil, and the crack wave... a poisonous toad is still a poisonous toad, dead or not.

3381 2018-12-01 23:57:25 I just found out about the CBD oil and I'm amazed. so much good for your body.
3382 2018-12-01 23:57:25 I am advocating for Oklahoma essentially because I don’t think OSU is going to get in and Bama shouldn’t get a bye into the playoff imo. Sell your snake oil somewhere else.

3384 2018-12-01 23:57:22 That's a pretty fashionable outfit for oil drilling!
3385 2018-12-01 23:57:11 Looks like the old man has lost all his ability to think rationally. Crude oil and legal weed  = Nigeria. 
These Pappu bhakts are getting crazier by minutes
3386 2018-12-01 23:57:08 No one I’ve loved has ever wantonly murdered anyone for oil.
3387 2018-12-01 23:56:58 Standard oil
3388 2018-12-01 23:56:52 How many barrels of oil = one US-based reporter?  Very convenient that gas prices plummeted when the bone saw recordings surfaced.  That is “winning” to Trump... since he’s not a fan of reporters.
3389 2018-12-01 23:56:49 beda. cleanser itu step sebelum fw, kaya micellar water atau oil cleanser pokonya makeup remover.
3390 2018-12-01 23:56:44 Democrats, including Bernie Sanders, are lavishing praise upon the man who helped set in motion all the wars for oil, because democrats also love wars and stealing oil. Everything else is just optics and controlled opposition. There is only one party and it is war for oil.
3391 2018-12-01 23:56:40 That’s the one thing I hate about living over here.. I don’t wanna run into this kid or his family cus I’ll pour oil on his car again and smack his sister 
3392 2018-12-01 23:56:37 Don’t think so, the Canadian government does sell the oil for itself, other wise Trudeau and Morneau would be very concerned and doing something!
3393 2018-12-01 23:56:35 The Lucas Oil Stadium is so nice  oh my
3394 2018-12-01 23:56:32 Next year this time ，stamdard oil will finlish explore in whole Ontrairo 
area . And I will find a first nation people to become the king of standard oil company.
3395 2018-12-01 23:56:32 Time to get tough on Putin. No need for talks. No need for Normandy. 
Just actions:
Cancel @NordStream2 
Block #SWIFT @swiftcommunity 
Block Russian commercial vessels in EU/US ports
Stop buying @GazpromEN  gas
Revoke @Aeroflot landing rights
No oil gas tech or
spare parts
3396 2018-12-01 23:56:23 Thanks Kar... you’re no oil painting yourself! 
3397 2018-12-01 23:56:18 Bio oil
3398 2018-12-01 23:56:10 I’m guessing so. I would think they would have to change out the engine oil and such after all that
3399 2018-12-01 23:56:09 Go Oil!!!!
3400 2018-12-01 23:55:53 I believe @JustinTrudeau is still buying oil from Saudi Arabia.
3401 2018-12-01 23:55:47 And when first trying MCT oil a bathroom is readily available
3402 2018-12-01 23:55:37 Ordinary people need to wrestle back Government control from the banks, weapons manufacturers & big oil, etc. These industries are home to the partly divested funds of the oligarchs.Unfortunately, the US population are the blunt tool, unable to resist propaganda, & CQB techniques
3403 2018-12-01 23:55:35 Probably.  The words were to reduce dependence on oil.

Koreans did it on time and budget. The project is 90% complete (4 units) and it is said that they will fire up on time in 2y as scheduled. 

25% of power demand and removal of oil burners.

also oil price dropped like a stone in 2014 to 2017 which nobody predicted

3415 2018-12-01 23:54:05 Guy at the bar is drinking a Foster’s oil can and sipping on a double shot of Jager. And arguing *across* the bar about divisions in football. Kind of love this guy.
3416 2018-12-01 23:53:51 I hated it. And it leaked on me hot oil 
3417 2018-12-01 23:53:50 @r4shidali, yes I'm long #crudeoil. I think oil is a great investment play for 2019 and the current volatility represents an excellent entry point for the long-term investor.
3418 2018-12-01 23:53:39 Hogwash.  The pain is felt via inflation caused by extreme fuel prices - do produce, hardgoods, heating oil and retail goods walk to the city center.  France protects are dozens and span the country.
3419 2018-12-01 23:53:35 We spoke of the essential oil formulas that I create for personal activation based on birthday & need. Tex 6 week supply has 130 doses

I spoke on the healing red clay that we market, the natural herbal tooth wash, the structured clustered water and the 320 mghtz Rose lotion
3420 2018-12-01 23:53:32 Hahaha hada labo punya cleansing oil mcm ok, sbb takde mineral oil
3421 2018-12-01 23:53:27 I need my brakes and oil changed asap  I need to be back on wheels again
3422 2018-12-01 23:53:25 I didn’t replace it. I found a mix of maple, hot sauce, cider vinegar, and coconut oil and veggie stock (along with some salt, pepper, and mustard powder) that keeps enough sweet hot to be balanced. I bet I would’ve worked it out sooner if I actually measured when I cooked.
3423 2018-12-01 23:53:13 There was no war for oil. All the oil stayed where it was. None was taken over by America. Bush the person was an epitome of class. Not something human trash like you would ever get. When you die no one will even come to spit on your carcass.
3424 2018-12-01 23:53:04 Oil is stronger and longer lasting
3425 2018-12-01 23:52:59 I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers and smother all those French beaches I'd never see.
3426 2018-12-01 23:52:45 Need an oil and gas guy to REALLY show you how to negotiate. #PutMeInCoachImReady
3427 2018-12-01 23:52:43 How else are they supposed to get to all that oil? It’s in the middle of nowhere.
3428 2018-12-01 23:52:33 If it was only about building a pipeline as far as Ontario, no doubt it would be built by now. 
Unfortunately, Ontario is still not a coastal Province and Quebec still has fresh memories of oil related disasters.
3429 2018-12-01 23:52:28 Any body asking this question is either ignorant or is intellectually corrupt. If you are ignorant, then here you go. Price of oil you get is based on crude oil price + refining price + transport price + tax. Therefore 30% reduction in crude oil will reduce price by 10-12% only.
3430 2018-12-01 23:52:26 I know “we aren’t going to start laying off nurses and teachers”! But oil workers are open season for NDP and Liberal Comrads!
3431 2018-12-01 23:52:22 Hunnigan, could you check and see if the BSAA has any units near the oil field?

3433 2018-12-01 23:51:36 um conventional wells aren't fracking wells, fracking is sucking rocks, not gather gases above oil reserves. The article explains quite nicely how much water is destroyed in the process, #newgold coming our way! Thirsty future!
3434 2018-12-01 23:51:34 Apparently they wanted to move to TX & go into oil biz b/c he wanted to do something "more real" than Wall Street & b/c she had a bossy older sister

The conspiracy BS isn't needed

3441 2018-12-01 23:50:33 renewable energy is some very nasty stuff:
19th century: Large scale deforestation before fossil fuels save remaining nature.
20th century: Whales nearly hunted to extinction for whale oil, but are saved by cheaper fossil fuel diesel
3442 2018-12-01 23:50:28 I have a recipe I love for Rosemary olive oil cake with Seville orange marmalade glaze over the top. Delish.
3443 2018-12-01 23:50:17 I spilt half a bottle of sandalwood essential oil on myself and I smell like if a hippie and a tree made a child
3444 2018-12-01 23:50:00 Islamic oil countries are funding Muslims who are responsible for the riots.
3445 2018-12-01 23:49:48 I seen so many people buying them today. This girl I follow a booster was selling them for $7 all month lol. I don’t use candles so i wouldn’t know. I love burning oil instead
3446 2018-12-01 23:49:35 @AlanFreestone Homeopathy and other weird unscientific activities cannot cure autism. Stop what you are doing now and get a proper job. Delete your account. Selling snake oil is not honourable or ethical.

3448 2018-12-01 23:49:12 When you do pedicures use olive oil on your feet, that shit gonn stay hydrated, creams & all that ain’t for our skin.
3449 2018-12-01 23:49:06 Muslims funded by Islamic oil countries are causing a riots in 'holy war'.
3450 2018-12-01 23:49:04 This is not an issue of political differences - it is one of moral differences.

Human decency? Bush showed none of it when he instigated wars (and death for innocent civilians as well as our military personnel) in a quest for oil.

I can't and wont show any respect for that.
3451 2018-12-01 23:49:03 can’t eat that it’s motor oil smh
3452 2018-12-01 23:48:52 The pirate attacks around Africa were more than oil, and the US Navy patrols those waters too.  If you believe that it's not in the US national interest to protect its manufactured goods being shipped around the world, then that's a different topic.

3455 2018-12-01 23:48:10 And I think somebody else mentioned oil pricing tanking so that certainly helps, but generally speaking gasoline always gets cheaper here in the Midwest from like November-March due to the winter blend of fuel
3456 2018-12-01 23:48:10 Wake up America! Look at what happened 2 Venezuela,  once upon a time thriving Democracy until.. stopped voting, didnt prosecute criminals, had  press CONTROLLED, limited who cud work, kept people poor & hungry....and today, nothing is left in spite of oil & fertile land.
3457 2018-12-01 23:48:03 Lots of info on him in the book The Big Rich, It's not a political book but gives insight to many of the politicians and their involvement in the oil industry and the news business before the 60's. Not sure the author knew what all he was revealing.

3459 2018-12-01 23:47:34 Same here. I don't think 12 years on antidepressants helped my brain either. Nutrition is good. Lion's Mane, B12 & omega 3 are all great for the brain & nervous system. Oh & cbd oil too.
We all have to find our way. Just going with it helps but good to have some natural help too
3460 2018-12-01 23:47:33 Nice I don’t have the salt lamp but the oil burner they are great
3461 2018-12-01 23:47:27 I appreciate all that you are doing.   I don't get why the Feds buy a pipeline and can't guarantee that it  will move oil!
3462 2018-12-01 23:47:23 Muslim extremists are responsible for the riots. Islamic oil countries are finding this 'holy war'.
3463 2018-12-01 23:47:19 There was a lot of oil to be considered
3464 2018-12-01 23:47:14 @SenatorCantwell said #trump needs to control oil prices,   so now low oil and gas prices are bad?  Its all good.  Interest rates will stay low and this will give cushion on trade.  It will all work out.

3466 2018-12-01 23:46:44 and what did hussain do? Chemical war far to his own? Plans for Kuwait were the same. He set fire to oil wells.

I served that war.

3479 2018-12-01 23:45:01 Kuwait was horizontally drilling Iraqi oil under the protection of the United States government- essentially theft. Saddam then summoned April Gillespie (U.S Ambassador to Iraq), and asked if the United States would intervene if Iraq were to recover lost oil revenue, she said no.
3480 2018-12-01 23:44:58 Fuel prices do not help Islamic oil countries. Muslim funded  by Islamic oil countries are taking over Paris.

3485 2018-12-01 23:44:31 Peanut has a very high smoke point and is very flavor neutral. Just gotta worry about allergies. 2nd best is Canola. Still a high smoke point and almost as neutral as peanut. For home frying(on a regular basis) peanut oil can be pricey.
3486 2018-12-01 23:44:28 Bullish AF for usdjpy. After last week's breakout the pull back has taken out all the stops. And Crude oil is another one to watch.

3491 2018-12-01 23:43:47 Galileo aside, the UK has no choice but to maintain direct engagement in European security through NATO or even EU structures. It is a lesson of two world wars & is crucial for the defence of the UK itself.

The alternative just pours oil onto an already inflamed position.

3496 2018-12-01 23:43:25 Watching @CBCNews @RosieBarton panel. Very concerned that @markusoff not factoring in citizen ownership of oil & gas resources. Continuing to sell oil below cost of production hurts Albertans as owners. Same point Lougheed made  This intervention in the private sector is unique.
3497 2018-12-01 23:43:09 Benefit of doubt given to him without any trial for his crime by jury consisted of China Russia and of course our own United States of America three super powers India’s Modi endorsed this with warmest hand shake with Saudi oil and Riyal
3498 2018-12-01 23:43:08 Since #RealDonaldTrump talked about not coming down hard on the Saudis because of their oil reserves, gas prices have dropped about 40 cents. That’s nice, if you like blood in your gas. #Khashoggi

3509 2018-12-01 23:42:20 It is disappointing that you and your government are doing absolutely nothing to help out hurting Oil patch unemployed. You are the weakest minister ever. Just repeats the party line and blame Harper for everything
3510 2018-12-01 23:42:16 Regardez votre facture de gaz... oil 
3511 2018-12-01 23:42:16 Is there a particular kind of oil that’s better suited to frying?  Peanut?
3512 2018-12-01 23:42:15 Muslim are responsible for the riots. Funded by Islamic oil countries thousands of Islamic immigrants are taking over Paris.

3516 2018-12-01 23:41:53 No, you don’t need their oil. That is a choice.

3520 2018-12-01 23:41:05 Air pollution from burning oil products kills over one million people per year. Very unhealthy for children and adults.
3521 2018-12-01 23:41:05 Former president of Shell Oil Company John Hofmeister said former President Barack Obama had nothing to do with America’s increased oil production and actually frustrated many areas of the energy sector.  #ObamaLegacy
3522 2018-12-01 23:41:04 i want a oil diffuser
3523 2018-12-01 23:41:01 Ameen
3524 2018-12-01 23:40:59 I guess, it just seems we spend a lot of money protecting "commercial interests" which really have nothing to do with "National Interest" Unless it's oil, then we go in with guns  blazing. I just wish the US would acknowledge it isn't about national security or defense, but oil
3525 2018-12-01 23:40:58 いってらっしゃい！楽しんできてー！！
3526 2018-12-01 23:40:57 All will take money shots of oil to their faces. Nothing ever is done
3527 2018-12-01 23:40:57 Your right Mr President, I have to admit, Mr Bush was a very successful oil tycoon, and lived a very good and long life. Too bad the simpletons on this thread have to find a way to make Mr Bush's death all about you. Stupid is as stupid does I guess! #MAGA
3528 2018-12-01 23:40:54 Yeah, right. His higher moral principle was “ gimme more oil money!”
3529 2018-12-01 23:40:47 A dads rage when you tell them you still haven’t gotten your oil changed is unmatched
3530 2018-12-01 23:40:38 Oh oil industry 
3531 2018-12-01 23:40:36 You are doing nothing this country is going down the drain jobs lost oil nowhere to go yea keep smiling you are nothing but a disgrace to your Father pals with the Mulroney's eh! they stole from us nothing but a bunch of weasels taking advantage of their name talk about smoozing
3532 2018-12-01 23:40:32 あ！何かガスマスクつけた白い鳥がいるぞ！待てー！
3533 2018-12-01 23:40:30 Btw. Next year base effects from oil will be almost surely negative (what about infl exp) and regarding inflation check out about Amazon effects, demographics, savings glut, less capital intensive need of today's investments (Google was made with a computer in a garage)
3534 2018-12-01 23:40:29 Watching Oil fans and Leafs fans is cute arguing how many cups they will get in 5 years & how many years of bad calls and unfair schedules is the reason for being crap. At least as a Habs fan I know we suck and I embrace it. Maybe my grandkids can see the Habs lift a cup. GHG

3539 2018-12-01 23:39:51 Muslims are responsible for these riots.  The riots are funded by Islamic oil countries to further their Islamic business agenda.
3540 2018-12-01 23:39:48 Cold boiled potatoes sliced and fried in a little oil on a pan with curry. Add some sliced tomato and let them fry a bit too. Lastly add an egg and stir while the egg scrambles. A dash of soy sauce finishes it all.
3541 2018-12-01 23:39:44 I wouldn't go so far as to say 'he outfoxed them' - are you familiar with Article 605 of the old NAFTA or the "Proportionality Clause"? This required Canada to sell to the US 74% of it's oil at a reduced price and if Canada is short, we must import OPEC oil. That clause is gone.
3542 2018-12-01 23:39:35 This nigga Eric got me in the swap meet looking like I just changed my oil and washed my car lol
3543 2018-12-01 23:39:33 ? the Bush family made their money in oil then ally with the Saudis, collude to suppress Iraq and all other oil producers in the region. It’s all well documented (See also Carlyle group) FFS. How the hell do you think a chump like GW ever got to be president. The man is a moron.
3544 2018-12-01 23:39:26 Their attempted solution to everything is higher taxes. Think they’re high now, wait until the realize the effects of $10 oil. Rather than fix the issue or stimulate industry, they’ll simply raise taxes. Clueless.
3545 2018-12-01 23:39:22 Xos'Vraham: Raaaggghh!!! *his arm transforms to a big giant artillery battleship cannon then he blasts kaname in the face sending him flying to a oil tanker as it explodes*
3546 2018-12-01 23:39:19 Please explain how moving oil in trucks and trains is better than a pipeline???
3547 2018-12-01 23:39:17 @RepDebDingell @SenStabenow @SenGaryPeters: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast
3548 2018-12-01 23:39:06 Did Trudeau cancel the 20 billion oil deliver from Saudi Arabia oh can’t do that no east west pipeline Quebec objected Trudeau denied the pipeline
3549 2018-12-01 23:38:52 I wish we got the oil as payment, it would be something.  Instead we just shovel money into the corrupt governments of countries in a region where corruption is endemic and a source of local pride.
3550 2018-12-01 23:38:47 Lol you say that like we went in there for humanitarian causes or some shit. Lmao we went in there to protect oil, not people.

3553 2018-12-01 23:38:33 They could use some oil tonight,  why they play the game,  what were they saying about the U before you guys brought your A game
3554 2018-12-01 23:38:32 Oil has it's own type of political power on a nation but Google's invasive nature makes it the most dangerous product to allow monopolization. I don't like government oversteering free market but we must use good sense.  
I wonder if I just got put on "the list."
3555 2018-12-01 23:38:28 Also, old/burned/dirty oil tends to stink more than fresh oil
3556 2018-12-01 23:38:23 Oil and gas development is the antithesis of what needs to happen to stop climate change.

3557 2018-12-01 23:38:23 Norway is awesomely going ahead with its renewables and support of EVs out of all other European countries

3559 2018-12-01 23:38:18 i worked out, ate, showered and put baby oil on from head to toe. now i’m in the living room w some wine, my durag on and the christmas tree lit watching georgia beat Alabama. serenity. full serenity.
3560 2018-12-01 23:38:06 and talking about Norway - it is the most heavily subsidized countries for EVs - if you wonder from where this wealth is coming from - oil and gas ... and a bit hydro power.
3561 2018-12-01 23:38:02 Fair enough. My concern is that people see that EVs don't have 0 environmental impact and use this as justification to keep burning oil .
3562 2018-12-01 23:37:56 that’s why i got blunt powder in the oil burner lls
3563 2018-12-01 23:37:53 Get her some some castor oil to grow her own hair.
3564 2018-12-01 23:37:51 I guess Pleasure, California doesn't have oil so you're holding the purse strings on them. Got it. And, yes, I know that it's Paradise, California. Unfortunately, Trump didn't.
3565 2018-12-01 23:37:49 Muslims funded by Islamic oil countries are causing riots for their Islamic agenda. The Prime Minister has said that these people do not represent France.
3566 2018-12-01 23:37:43 Nah. Steam and super tiny droplets of fryer oil fly thru the airspreading their golden brown goodness all over the house. Best way to mitigate it is to fry on the stove with the hood fan on. That will subdue the aroma

3573 2018-12-01 23:37:05 Ves wee ahi está el primero...ya para cuando EEUU tuvo su primera guerra ya era potencia económica, cuando standard oil encontro la primer gota de petróleo ya existia la propiedad privada, esa es la diferencia.
3574 2018-12-01 23:37:03 It is good to see #Russia and #SaudiArabia agreeing to manage the supply of #crudeoil at the fringes of the #G20 summit. It's now over to #OPEC next week. I predict Brent at $70 by the new year. We need an oil price that continues to incentivise investment in future production.
3575 2018-12-01 23:37:02 The oil I swear it got rid of all my pain after work 12 on a forklift

Gotta dab some tea tree oil twice a day, thank god it helps!
3579 2018-12-01 23:36:35 Non è vero. Mio figlio li ascolta sempre e nella massa di scontati qualcuno  di bravo c’è davvero. Ascolta Murubutu. È un prof di filosofia rapper. Testi bellissimi. “I marinai tornano tardi” oil suo disco con i pezzi con i nomi dei venti. Prova.

3581 2018-12-01 23:36:33 Thank you for the thread. Any sowcific reason you d use oil supply analogy and not gold for example which is usually more relatable ?

3585 2018-12-01 23:35:43 The only real legacy of G.H.W. Bush was how well he looked after his pals in the oil patch and the environmental aftermath that he never saw fit to deal with.

3587 2018-12-01 23:35:23 I haven’t heard momma cuss this much since I busted the oil pan on my old car and if that doesn’t explain how mad this game is making momma idk what will
3588 2018-12-01 23:35:22 It is a communist dictatorship. Millions of citizens have fled. People are starving in the streets. Media is govt controlled. Oil money goes directly into the pockets of the dictatorship.
3589 2018-12-01 23:35:18 The riots about oil are funded by Muslim oil countries. Muslims are causing riots in Paris to further their Islamic agenda.
3590 2018-12-01 23:34:57 My mom just said that I could fry an egg with how much oil that’s on my face

3594 2018-12-01 23:33:36 "No country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and leave them there," is a weird thing for someone worried about climate change to say.
3595 2018-12-01 23:33:30 The Iraq war was to protect oil pipelines owned by the Bush dynasty running through that country- sycophantic nonsense from media
3596 2018-12-01 23:33:27 I would let him check my oil
3597 2018-12-01 23:33:25 Has nothing to do with the differential btw world prices and alberta’s price. The effect of our glut far exceeds the global ratio. 

Alberta HAS diversified. Far less percentage of GDP relies on FF. However, you can’t go from selling oil to selling wooden chopsticks overnight.
3598 2018-12-01 23:33:23 Wonder if oil cap is included.

3610 2018-12-01 23:31:42 Sorry for being a dick. I thought you were another Yemen war/genocide obfuscator. My bad, you really do seem concerned about the genocide. But yea, its clearly only sectarian in a microscale. It’s about mass oil profits and potential for war with Iran
3611 2018-12-01 23:31:35 The oil thing mate.
3612 2018-12-01 23:31:32 Ok yes, George HW Bush was the heir to massive oil wealth partially garnered from doing business with Nazis, and yes he ran the CIA as programs to suppress Black communities skyrocketed, and yes he ran a racist campaign, and yeah he combed civilians. But he was civil. #civility

3623 2018-12-01 23:30:30 Which Alberta complains to no ends about. Our wealth should not be concentrated in one sector. We're too vulnerable that way.  Strngth needs to be able to shift to other regions. In the last oil low, nfl saw a net increase in needed young people for the 1st time, most from alb.
3624 2018-12-01 23:30:21 Bush Sr was president for 12 years. He used his CIA information to architect the Iran/Contra incident and then got us into the first Gulf War to cover it up. He was the first Bush to be elected by Big Oil.
3625 2018-12-01 23:30:14 OK But isis wouldn't have happened if Saddam was there. It is a known thing. I guess we have to suffer the shit from those in charge as I see all the time here. I just wish the oil would run out now and that would be the end of all this shit.

3630 2018-12-01 23:29:56 I've gone to post secondary school for 6 plus years to qualify for my job making 60k year after 20 years of experience.

3634 2018-12-01 23:28:55 A 3rd of your list are literally just the positions he held.  Navy Pilot, CIA Director, President, VP.

3636 2018-12-01 23:28:54 It's the opposite of prisoner's dilemma. The oil company that cuts first loses the most. The small companies cut first, go bk, then the big companies cut last after taking all the market share. The gov must step in. We should be doing this in USA too.
3637 2018-12-01 23:28:28 ...already happening. BUT, there will always be a need for coal and a complete, sudden ban is ridiculous. What about oil?

3655 2018-12-01 23:26:27 The oil is all that works on Mija during the storms 

Groupon always has sales, but this was just theirs. & way way better
3656 2018-12-01 23:26:22 Not to mention the oil and gas and coal needed for building and operating machinery that can mine for metals like copper in the first place.
3657 2018-12-01 23:26:09 Imagine how much better Rice would be if it didn't function as a privileged/expensive launch pad for jobs at shitty and exploitative tech giants and oil and gas companies.
3658 2018-12-01 23:26:05 He wasn’t the good man you and others on the right portray.  Saudi oil owned him, made him and his family has been just bad bad bad for America BUT

In death it becomes pointless to continue that narrative against him and in the end he was a loving husband and father.
3659 2018-12-01 23:26:00 Apparently coconut oil works ???? And just don’t pluck them at all whatsoever
3660 2018-12-01 23:25:53 DESTROY OIL COMPANIES!!!!!!!
3661 2018-12-01 23:25:53 If you think #Socialism caused the problems in #Venezuela, then you have no understanding of what actually happened down there. 

Their problems all revolves around Oil! #FossilFuels
3662 2018-12-01 23:25:27 If you dab oil off your pizza are you really enjoying it?

3670 2018-12-01 23:24:42 NYC should pass a law requiring it to drill for oil in the Trump Tower lobby all day and night 24/7 until they find it
3671 2018-12-01 23:24:27 @scathony just yelled at me to come into the kitchen to help open oil. What he didn’t realize is that it was a pull tab to open it....
3672 2018-12-01 23:24:22 We're 4 months away from the next presidential elections and our economy is in a bad situation because we're an oil dependent state and MBS has just screwed us all
3673 2018-12-01 23:24:18 At least their mum did not ask you to apply engine oil
3674 2018-12-01 23:24:18 Huge hand of clap to @wmnylander for sign new contracts with Maple Leaf! Best memory I have of William was when look like run out of motors oil.

3676 2018-12-01 23:24:00 Socialism isn’t what caused the problem in Venezuela. 
It was their dependence on OIL that got them in trouble. 
Once oil prices fell, buying products, including food, became expensive. To try to fix this, the gov printed more money. Now their money is worthless.
3677 2018-12-01 23:23:59 Looks like when you pour the oil and congealed meat juice from mince...
3678 2018-12-01 23:23:54 What you say is true our peoples are so behind and the majority of them carry nation values or cultural ones that predate Islam and are incompatible. Women see supposed to have a bigger role in Islam and government. So far men who worship dajall money and oil and kill say no.
3679 2018-12-01 23:23:52 I would suggest sending your ship from the oil rig to the nearest land and transfering your cargo to a train taking it at speed to the refinery
3680 2018-12-01 23:23:48 I love body oil  like it just make u feel urself  u be smelling good af and dont nobody kno until u walk by  or giving hugs  !!
3681 2018-12-01 23:23:38 Just cooked latkes for 2.5 hours. Hopefully the people sitting near me at @ArmchairExpPod like the smell of potatoes and oil.
3682 2018-12-01 23:23:37 From the article
The command is seen as critical to US security interests...A tremendous amount of commercial shipping, including large amounts of oil and gas, travels through the waters overseen by Fifth Fleet
From me
So the US Navy exists to protect commercial shipping?
3683 2018-12-01 23:23:12 Cadbury’s Dairy Milk Chocolate,contain Palm Oil...! Its destroying the orangutans habitat .

3686 2018-12-01 23:22:41 I made little golden potatoes with lentils and accidentally didn't notice the pot was out of water. Caught a disaster in time. Yet also, I had crispy potatoes and lentils. Very, very delicious. All drenched in olive oil, garlic, turmeric, berbere spice, parsley, and sea salt.
3687 2018-12-01 23:22:36 Bruh tell my why everybody and they mama wanna get a oil change today, we stay hella busy
3688 2018-12-01 23:22:30 cmon rachel you have what you have been campaigning for years... leave oil in the ground no pipelines.... etc.. now you pretend to care....
3689 2018-12-01 23:22:29 When all you see is oil and oil money in an socioeconomically and fast changing world.
3690 2018-12-01 23:22:28 I love vaping oil 
3691 2018-12-01 23:22:25 ndp is simply trying to save their political lives hence such love for oil and gas sector all of a sudden, too little too late
3692 2018-12-01 23:22:18 theres no olive oil at the store.. we havent had any around here in months. i can get you syrup though?
3693 2018-12-01 23:22:10 Do you need oil for that "Make video" button? It seems a little stuck
3694 2018-12-01 23:22:09 He out HIV+ Haitians in a concentration camp. He won using blatantly racist “Willie Horton” campaign. He started a war to protect his oil industry pals. You were a baby then, but suggest to find out who he really was.
3695 2018-12-01 23:21:50 Because Iraq had invaded and annexed Kuwait,  and when forced out, set fire to 600 oil wells.
3696 2018-12-01 23:21:50 Who thinks going after the guy that controls all the oil is a winning idea?

3698 2018-12-01 23:21:27 Crazy auld world, those who through their military interventionism on behalf of Oil & Weapon suppliers have caused millions to seek refuge, are most vocal in their disdain for refugees. Be it #Brexiteers or #WallBuilders, believe in looking after our own 1st but oh the hypocrisy.
3699 2018-12-01 23:21:23 Venezuela relied too much on the price of oil. It had no other natural resources or product to sell. 
So when the price of oil dropped, everything got expensive, and to try to fix it the gov inflated the value. Now it’s worthless. 
Nothing to do with Socialism.

3702 2018-12-01 23:21:10 AND IM NOT EXPLAINING THIS ONE BUT IT ENDED UP WITH THE BAND DIRECTOR COVERED IN CORK GREASE AND VALVE OIL AND A FLUTE INSIDE OF A CLARINET INSIDE OF A TUBA
3703 2018-12-01 23:21:07 Lavender or tea tree oil and certain supplements such as Dong Quai and Tribulus terrestris have also been associated with gynecomastia.
3704 2018-12-01 23:20:58 I'm grateful that you have no offspring, one less taker with their hands out. 

I'll enjoy my life in Texas, with a beautiful family, 2 small businesses and a booming economy (thanks Oil & Gas!) to soothe my soul. Don't worry about the water, our vacay beach house is elevated!
3705 2018-12-01 23:20:57 You don't even know what goes on in your own house (Tony Clement) I wouldn't expect you to know what goes on in oil camps. But you could Google it if that's not committing to much sociology for your party faithful.
3706 2018-12-01 23:20:32 Georgia is literally sucking the air out of every Ohio State fan as they stand in line to come into Lucas Oil Field.....
3707 2018-12-01 23:20:30 Some pay very little, banks, big oil, automakers get all kinds of handouts, breaks and use all kinds of loopholes to avoid paying.
3708 2018-12-01 23:20:20 Went to the Lucas Oil Stadium to take pictures and ended up finding out the Big Ten championship game is going on tonight between Ohio St and Northwestern 
3709 2018-12-01 23:20:06 You had me until “keep it in for five minutes.” Our late Dog have been out into the yard to roll it off...but maybe lavender oil doesn’t annoy them?
3710 2018-12-01 23:19:53 The Russians left. They still survived. It’s time to cut our losses. The only reason for staying would be control of the opium trade and possibly oil.
3711 2018-12-01 23:19:41 Ugh. That is hard this time of year. Can you do olive oil? I’ve made some great treats with that.
3712 2018-12-01 23:19:38 Just drink these shakes and slather yourself in oregano oil! Would you like to host a party?
3713 2018-12-01 23:19:36 @SajeWellness can I put the oil from the “Sleep well” roller in a diffuser ?
3714 2018-12-01 23:19:34 No , all we respect USA but last case all USA press attack our prince like anything, before we stand a lot with USA to stop radical Islam & keep oil price as per trump and his ppl wish but they never stand with us as real ally . CNN and Washington post lost their credibility.

3716 2018-12-01 23:19:12 I think the nadir of the negotiations is France's demand that we give them rights over UK natural resources in exchange for being allowed to trade. That is morally identical to if the US had demanded that Iraq sign over 20% of its oil reserves if it wanted to be allowed to trade

3728 2018-12-01 23:17:38 Of course. I'd vote for your hair trimmings sauteed with a little extra virgin olive oil and fresh garlic too.
3729 2018-12-01 23:17:38 I’m kind of surprised Trump hasn’t tried to blame the earthquake in Alaska on failure to oil the tectonic plates or something equally ridiculous
3730 2018-12-01 23:17:36 I say things that are facts all the time like The Saudi's subjugate women , gays and non-Muslims and the US government Reps and dems have been  complicit to it for decades for oil. You only get banned if you have a bunch of followers I barely have 100 therefor Im not a threat.
3731 2018-12-01 23:17:22 Absolute B.S. no where near oil production. You really need to educate yourself Jake.
3732 2018-12-01 23:17:19  we must all go green no more coal and gas - we need to work out how to live without oil or massively reduce use - I don’t want to die a horrible death like starvation or drowning but with Trumps Bolsonaros Putins in the world ....how can we change
3733 2018-12-01 23:17:12 Are you saying every oil and gas insider who answered the questionnaire is lying?
3734 2018-12-01 23:16:54 We need to tax pollution, to deter it.
Tax it, it will boost the demand for technological jumps into less polluting options.
They already exist, but oil companies are too powerful. Like tobacco companies.

3736 2018-12-01 23:16:48 His father was a nazi collaborator who made all his money with nazi banks and lawyers. Prescot bush was the nazi. George HW bush fought for America during wwii. Then came home and turned his nazi money inheritance into oil and blood money

3738 2018-12-01 23:16:26 It has helped me with so many things. Did you try Hempworx or another product? Hempworx is the most pure oil and it lists the ingredients on the package. Most of the other cbd oils are filled with filler oils like olive oil.
3739 2018-12-01 23:16:17 Such a productive day got a oil change cleaned up and did laundry

3750 2018-12-01 23:15:07 I work in the oil and gas industry (office now), but first started out in the field and in camps. I was treated with nothing but respect by male coworkers. Trudeau is such a disgrace!

3753 2018-12-01 23:14:44 It’s on amazon and after you wash it out, moisturize your hair and seal it with an oil so it doesn’t dry out. Also, try to stay away from heat.
3754 2018-12-01 23:14:34 That would have been a treat had the cork been ok. Damn! How’s the sediment in the Neck Oil!! Wow!
3755 2018-12-01 23:14:32 @CillianZeal Alaska earthquake and oil drilling. the left was and may still be pushing the false meme that fracking causes earthquakes. This has been proven wrong like almost all of their BS 

There is fracking in AK. I believe most of it is at least 500 miles from Anchorage

now sub 50

this is why it is never passed to the people

3757 2018-12-01 23:14:12 Donald Trump giving the greenlight to seismic uses to discover oil will never happen on the West coast. Never!
3758 2018-12-01 23:14:05 Good Lord that’s heartbreaking. He dropped Bella 18 feet into a foot and a half of oil.  Does it look like he’s had liposuction on his belly?  Soulless piece of shit
3759 2018-12-01 23:14:03 Electric tooth brush is a simple,cost effective investment for your health.

Much more effective then a regular toothbrush.

Throw in some oil pulling,and floss after every meal and you'll be  creating a pristine oral hygiene program.
3760 2018-12-01 23:13:58 Oil change has been done finally! No more procrastination.
3761 2018-12-01 23:13:46 I hate nothing more than getting an oil change
3762 2018-12-01 23:13:45 Wait until 40. I used to blot oil off my pizza, now I slather it under my eyes. 
3763 2018-12-01 23:13:38 Oh yes, the British fucked it up but before the oil shit of the Bush dynasty it was at least stable. The Bush family are arseholes, each and every one.
3764 2018-12-01 23:13:35 Thank you so much! I will try peanutbutter and honey! I made a peppermint cdb latté this morning and today is the first day I feel like myself again! I tasted the oil a tiny bit but, so far so good! 
3765 2018-12-01 23:13:33 I won't go that far. Iran's oil being on the market with the waivers has a lot of influence.
3766 2018-12-01 23:13:24 If we had a PM who didn't want to destroy the oil industry we could now build a pipeline to the St'lawrence

3777 2018-12-01 23:12:06 It works soo well for me bc I have super dry skin, but coconut oil never worked for me. It moisturizes so well and dries down so its not sticky all night! It also works well under foundation to make it more dewy

3779 2018-12-01 23:11:45 Rail cars only carry about 700 barrels of #oil right? so 30 cars @ 700 = 21000 barrels of Oil then what at shipping port?  Big Oil tanker carries much more than that.
3780 2018-12-01 23:11:44 So nice try blaming NDP instead of oil and gas industry.
3781 2018-12-01 23:11:28 are you high?? 100,000 lost jobs in the oil patch, 3000 direct jobs plus 10,000 associated in Auto Sector in Ontario, lowest Foreign Investment in sh'thole Canada in 15 years huge deficits when economy is booming, open borders, no pipelines, Canada will only produce potheads soon
3782 2018-12-01 23:11:27 You could show you really mean it by eliminating the Carbon tax, eliminating the cap on the oil sands and eliminating the coal phase out. Failure to do so make you look like you are still Trudeaus puppet
3783 2018-12-01 23:11:25 Roscoe Bartlett (R) was on of the few to speak of Peak Oil. Let's reach across the divide and connect with others for the betterment of all.  Freedom for individuals will increase with in situ energy production and local fuel sources.

3791 2018-12-01 23:10:04 "go-to rep for the oil industry, which could provide Nixon with the Texas financial juice he would need to win the Republican nomination in 1968. Bush was also now a crucial link to an alliance that was forming between Eastern bankers, Texas oilmen, and intelligence operatives."
3792 2018-12-01 23:10:02 In the middle of the Gulf of Mexico there is an oil leak spewing 100s or 1000s of oil into the gulf as we speak. They know how to drill those wells but have no clue how to stop the leaks..so true the Gulf of Mexico will be dead water nothing able to live there soon.
3793 2018-12-01 23:10:01 We all need a snake oil roommate to look out for us!!
3794 2018-12-01 23:09:55 Looks like she got some of Obama's ego. Obama says he's responsible for the oil boom taking place now. Al Gore claimed to have invented the internet and saved the environment.  Do all Dems claim credit for things they didn't do?.
3795 2018-12-01 23:09:54 His legacy is that of an oil man who became aware of the problems his industry was creating and tried to begin countering them.
3796 2018-12-01 23:09:51 yall be retweeting photos of pancakes saying “engine oil and cardboard if u know u know”
bitch I think we all fucking know
3797 2018-12-01 23:09:45 Maybe he is upset that you talk crude about oil?
3798 2018-12-01 23:09:26 The best thing EVER to use is the Aztec Indian Clay Mask mixed with coconut oil (or any oil of your choice) and mayonnaise. Your curls will be POPPING after 
3799 2018-12-01 23:09:09 I’m hoping that we win the random number lottery hoping for 1988 or 1989. 2004 would also@be sweet.
3800 2018-12-01 23:08:57 Ahh the lovely smell of oil in the morning
3801 2018-12-01 23:08:49 Out getting an oil change and they always tell me about the million other things I need but have no idea what they’re talking about  but at least I TRY with my car....
3802 2018-12-01 23:08:48 So you've just become hypocritical by saying about saying how people look then saying about how I look! Im not a spring chicken....sorry love, you ain't exactly an oil painting yourself!
3803 2018-12-01 23:08:47 He had no oil left.
3804 2018-12-01 23:08:35 Engine oil and bleach. 50:50 ratio.
3805 2018-12-01 23:08:11 My work experience of 35 years in the ‘patch’ says that’s the biggest false brag I’ve ever heard.  2014-16 saw a loss in oil prices of over 70% & more than 100,000 jobs lost in the USA!
Thanks Obama!
3806 2018-12-01 23:07:44 Farming, mostly.
Using oil lamps and kerosene cooking stoves.
Kids do their homework before it gets dark because there’s no lighting.
Schools don’t have electricity.
They die of treatable diseases because there’s 1 doctor per 36,000 people and one healthcare worker per 8,000.
3807 2018-12-01 23:07:43 Got my oil changed and I changed my cabin and air filters myself...
3808 2018-12-01 23:07:29 Diffusing a purification essential oil and listening to Prince as I write my preview in a bid to sap the strength of the Erotic City Wolves... trying to do my part for @HebertofRiffs mission for three straight wins
3809 2018-12-01 23:07:23 Tax breaks aren't subsidies, they're incentive. Please provide an example of a direct subsidy that exists currently in the Canadian oil industry.
3810 2018-12-01 23:07:20 indeed. although I not only added more water to the onions when they were close to burning but also more olive oil, to keep it in line with the story :)

3812 2018-12-01 23:07:09 for face...tony moly ferment snail, skii essence, or primally pure beauty cream. For body bath and body body oil layered with bath and body cream lotion the kind in a tube not the bottle. skii is my favorite but it's the most expensive of them

3814 2018-12-01 23:06:48 Lol it’s Shea moisture and a lot of coconut oil, olive, and castor oil mixed together. Moisturize your scalp w them :)
3815 2018-12-01 23:06:46 Do you think the oil prices will go down because of a slowing global economy?
3816 2018-12-01 23:06:44 Conspiracy theory you say? 
Like "Big Oil" is out to get Musk?
3817 2018-12-01 23:06:35 Not oil spills, it's nowhere near any oil fields, refineries or shipping lanes. 
Possibly something for topography.
3818 2018-12-01 23:06:31 So he “demands” from the Russians; and “avoids confrontation” with the Saudis! I guess he knows who eastern Canada depends on for oil. If only someone had thought of building a pipeline east from Alberta! Oh wait....
3819 2018-12-01 23:06:30 last week much is revealed. Trump Tower was bait for Trump to get him to run, then the collusion is revealed as negotiations continued until 6/14 when Russia ID'd hacking Dems, but the underlying crime of conspiracy was Ukraine and sanctions that include oil
3820 2018-12-01 23:06:09 That is novel . Venezuela once sent free heating oil to te US & their reward was to be demonised & when that did notnwork , a proxy revolution . Or maybe because they won all the beauty contests.
3821 2018-12-01 23:06:05 Now playing Midnight Oil - Forgotten Years on Movie Scores and More Radio

3823 2018-12-01 23:06:02 The arms had separated fairly easily with the combined force of their attacks. Causing the rest of the robot to land into the sea.

It was good that the didn’t decide to just bust through the robot’s chest, as it could have resulted in an oil spill.

“Mhm Let’s finish him!”
3824 2018-12-01 23:05:57 I cheated today & used Trader Joe's spaghetti sauce-gussied it up with onions & carrots sauteed in olive oil & butter with added seasoning. Usually make my sauce from scratch but son & wife can't tell the difference.
3825 2018-12-01 23:05:47 Calories lool... reduces calories a lot because of the amount of oil u use
3826 2018-12-01 23:05:39 Tastes like chicken but why you leave the skin on like that? Boys wasted they chance to make snake oil.
3827 2018-12-01 23:05:37 My car gets me to and from, that’s all I need sweet cheeks. And idk if you’re trying to say I don’t pay for shit, but everything that goes on with my car, I pay for. Yes my mom bought it, but I pay for the insurance, oil changes, and shit it needs IF it was to break.

3829 2018-12-01 23:05:33 We sure will. I’m for floating cars. Fuck the Union. They’ll be stuck on earth. They’re not stealing our gravity like they did our oil!
3830 2018-12-01 23:05:31 Palm oil is causing the destruction of our last remaining primary rainforests.  Mother orangs are killed + tortured as they try to find food.shelter + protect their young: Babies which are sold on to the pet + zoo trade. We are all responsible for these atrocities. Each purchase!
3831 2018-12-01 23:05:29 Hahaha he is bloody dreadful no denying that. And Beyoncé is hundy P an oil painting 
3832 2018-12-01 23:05:17 lmao uhhh ok ....

He wants to phase out oil to switch to renewables ... So that we can then switch from renewables to nothing?
3833 2018-12-01 23:05:15 In the 50s, there were thousands of pro-auto zoning regulations slipped into national zoning templates by auto & tire makers and big oil. These regs linger on today, especially in suburbs. The lobbyists who did this are long gone but we still suffer from their corrupt intentions.
3834 2018-12-01 23:05:09 You said GW. That's Dubya, not the elder Bush.
No, not everything in the ME is the West's fault. And no, not every problem can be reduced to oil.
Saddam was responsible for his own actions and countless crimes against humanity.
3835 2018-12-01 23:04:50 @gaucoin13 please give reference for your statement of “little Saudi oil” and “overwhelming majority from US”! I’d really like to see them. Thanks!
3836 2018-12-01 23:04:47 Yup. Common sense. Banned in Alberta. Good luck with that.

Score to date?
Oil industry? give up your car.
Education? confused and failing
Alternate energy MIA
3837 2018-12-01 23:04:45 Been at work all damn day and still gotta get my oil changed when I get off  I just wanna go tf home
3838 2018-12-01 23:04:42 "Seismic blasting is a violent, destructive precursor to unnecessary offshore oil drilling," said Angela Howe, Surfrider Foundation Legal Director

3840 2018-12-01 23:04:26 Helping his wealthy oil and coal friends. Also helping business owners who don’t want to stop polluting etc.
3841 2018-12-01 23:04:26 Justin is committed to destroying Canada's oil sands, imposing Carbon Taxation to make up the difference of tax revenue lost, and empowering the madness of the women's movement as he encourages parents of 4-yr-olds to transgender their children as a means of excepting himself.
3842 2018-12-01 23:04:23 Follow the money and you will see all of Trump's rich "oil and gas" friends getting richer due to cancelled regulations. All of your statements are wrong but then you believe the biggest liar in the world, so....
3843 2018-12-01 23:04:12 From Oil and Gas he is spilling into Europe and China. He is siting on his pipe like as a frog.
3844 2018-12-01 23:04:11 Even if you don't believe in the science, what is the harm in trying to make a cleaner earth. I have no idea what is the motive for the scientist to lie. The way I see it there is plenty of reasons for the oil and gas ppl to not do anything.
3845 2018-12-01 23:04:07 New products coming soon to our Amazon store!
 Creations Herbs Brand of Hemp OIL
3846 2018-12-01 23:03:57 Oil & coal companies, Big Ag & real estate developers. All people the see something & think, "MINE!"
3847 2018-12-01 23:03:52 Olive oil is of high value in terms of nutrition as it regulares blood pressure and cholestrol levels. However, the concept behind addition to salads, it to make it palatable or edible as, naturally you can't drink plain Olive oil to gain the nutritive values.
3848 2018-12-01 23:03:50 Can't get involved with Cadbury because of the palm oil in their product.
3849 2018-12-01 23:03:47 Sad... But what now? Hopefully that's just not a massive stash of valuable whale oil being buried, dragged out to sea, left to rot on a hill, or be otherwise wasted. #ConserveResources
3850 2018-12-01 23:03:47 Crispy Pan-Fried Rice Noodles w/ Spicy Roasted Red Pepper Cream Sauce (Got red pepper roasting in oven now -extra virgin olive oil, coarse pink himalayan salt + bk. pepper. Adding crushed red peppers, Trader's It. tomato paste, fresh parm later 2 this) +  Rolling Rocks.
3851 2018-12-01 23:03:43 Cause there’s oil in them there hills and we want it!
3852 2018-12-01 23:03:29 And let me also ask what about ethics of drilling & transporting oil products?  Once burnt petrol/diesel are gone and must be mined again. Lithium batteries firstly last 100,000’s miles, then can be used in homes as “2nd life”, and guess what,at end, Lithium can be then RECYCLED.
3853 2018-12-01 23:03:29 Muslims funded by Islamic oil countries are destroying Paris in a 'holy war'.
3854 2018-12-01 23:03:27 Solar & other renewable energies are the future, but big oil buys the politicians. When a conservative Republican town like Georgetown goes 100% renewable, you know what the truth is.
3855 2018-12-01 23:03:23 Puddle of olive oil on the sxsw international stage at the combination pizza hut and urgent care. I'm at the supermarket.
3856 2018-12-01 23:03:23 Considering the price of oil and natural gas, there's nearly no business case for doing this, and yet they will.
3857 2018-12-01 23:03:22 Producing more oil actually helps huh..? Imagine that. @realDonaldTrump was right again.
3858 2018-12-01 23:03:18 I thought Asia couldn't refine oil sands oil. I thought all the oil being loaded onto ships is currently going south to California not west to China. Will the pipeline actually increase access to new markets?
3859 2018-12-01 23:03:09 Wow, I had a woman that told me if I came to her house she would put oil on my feet and pray that my toes would grow... REALLY??? Is your oil mixed w-Miracle Growbtw if that had happened, there’d be a HUGE SELL on all my cute toddler shoes
3860 2018-12-01 23:02:55 Olbas oil burning out my eyeballs #fuckwinter
3861 2018-12-01 23:02:33 It’s the best! Coconut oil is used for many things.. cooking, moisturizer for skin, body and hair, toothpaste.. so much lol although I don’t use it for toothpaste
3862 2018-12-01 23:02:32 No, it would not. Literally this entire thread is about Gold devaluing (going up) against Oil.
3863 2018-12-01 23:02:19 Exactly. We have what, 500k people living in commuting distance of Aberdeen? Supposed oil capital of Europe, and one train line, minimal trains, expensive & no link to airport.
3864 2018-12-01 23:02:14 Oil change then car wash
3865 2018-12-01 23:02:12 Day 6

stay positive 
change your lockscreen/wallpaper 
think of what you’re goals are 
try oil pulling (for you’re teeth)
tell someone they’re beautiful 
drink a healthy smoothie 
stay away from oily packaged foods
3866 2018-12-01 23:02:03 There are over 200+ names of palm oil derivatives that are used in fast food vegetarian and vegan products. Conflict palm oil is destroying our planet.  It is causing the horrendous cruelty, torture +possible extinction of one of our closest relatives, our precious Orangutans.

3868 2018-12-01 23:01:46 I dip me hands in oil
3869 2018-12-01 23:01:43 Taking charge of my eating habits. Roasted vegetables in Garlic olive oil. Fresh fresh and rice.
Sorry, not sorry Myron Wallace 
3870 2018-12-01 23:01:41 Kim and I ordered ours today!!!!! Start the 5-10 business day clock!!! Can’t wait!
3871 2018-12-01 23:01:41 Your girl finessed a free oil change. Fucking bless.
3872 2018-12-01 23:01:40 Did you just said crude oil was sold for $150 per barrel
3873 2018-12-01 23:01:24 Sturgeon has won £300M on the Euromillions. She's cut a deal with Big Oil, bought the Labour Party & is putting the band back together, better this time. 

Tusk has offered Scotland the Norway model.

Nuclear Subs are flying the Saltire.

Northumberland has applied for asylum.
3874 2018-12-01 23:01:21 My dad wouldn't let me drive until I could change a tire and the oil in my car! I can type and sew too! Lol Actually I like the fact that I can do all that but some men find it intimidating. Like I'm supposed to rely on them?!? Pffft!
3875 2018-12-01 23:01:19 Anyone who thinks that this is only oil producing is naive
3876 2018-12-01 23:01:08 Crazy is right! It was SO confusing! Why were they more concerned with me stealing chocolates from the fridge instead of actual baby oil?? 
3877 2018-12-01 23:01:08 As useful as rubbing snake oil into the legs
3878 2018-12-01 23:01:02 So no oil company has ever gone out of business from mismanagement?  Unlikely.  Other countries are switching - that's an export opportunity.  We either take it and lead, or play catch-up in the coming economic shift and wonder where our power/influence went.
3879 2018-12-01 23:00:53 Trudeau’s friend. Don’t forget he is pro Saudi or he wouldn’t buy their oil
3880 2018-12-01 23:00:41 Suma: In public, She will try to make him smile or laugh (her last ditch is flashing him and dragging him somewhere to “work out” the frustration)

In private she will massage him, oil his scales with an infused oil of chamomile, lavender, lilac, honeysuckle and vanilla. If—
3881 2018-12-01 23:00:31 hello friends I'm hoping you're having a great 1st of December!!!  

I'm out here toasting pita bread with olive oil & oregano & making some lemon & ginger tea  

I hope you've all been able to eat something today! 
3882 2018-12-01 23:00:27 If they declare war on an oil rich country would this make them greattttttt...?
3883 2018-12-01 23:00:23 I like gold but wouldnt it drop with oil sinking to $30?
3884 2018-12-01 23:00:16 I understand Trudeau intends to legislate all oil workers to wear high heels as a condition of compliance to Bill C-69.
3885 2018-12-01 23:00:13 Mideast banks tied 2 the CIA would crowd alongside Florida Savings& Loans that once laundered money 4  Nicaraguan contras. Dozens of oil wells would run eternally w/o finding oil, thanks to periodic cash deposits by old men wearing Reagan-Bush buttons smoking 20-dollar cigars."
3886 2018-12-01 23:00:12 So PJ is against the oil problem? WTF?
3887 2018-12-01 23:00:10 Lets not forget the Gulf War aka The Oil Wars
3888 2018-12-01 23:00:07 Lol. Here's an obvious fact for you, the oil companies are the people who are making money destroying the country and paying handsomely for people with no ethics to lobby against the obvious science behind climate change.
3889 2018-12-01 23:00:01 @ObamaFoundation should have their leader issue a clarifying statement about whether he wants oil or the Paris Agreement because he's too smart to not know that wanting both isn't a feasible option. Whatsay, @BarackObama?
3890 2018-12-01 23:00:00 I guess that makes it the usual right-wing playground insults? I don’t categorize my political beliefs or support of public policy by right or left. Stop raising your sons to think they have to work in the oil industry...it’s a dead end.
3891 2018-12-01 22:59:58 Yeah I remember when that Vietnamese child wanted to not be colonized and that Iraqi kid wanted to live above oil reserves. I’m glad those troops fought for my freedom by napalming and drone bombing the shit out of them without due process. Wouldn’t have been free without it 
3892 2018-12-01 22:59:54 @RepTomRice @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast
3893 2018-12-01 22:59:43 and its okay for Quebec to have French only signs and services while taking in Saudi Arabia oil and taking money from AB.
3894 2018-12-01 22:59:34 Great point! How much oil has been taken out the North Sea yet one shitty unreliable rail line! Meanwhile London spends billions on its public transport at the expense of UK public transport
3895 2018-12-01 22:59:33 BC has had numerous mining projects rejected just this past year. Hydro-Quebec has its $680M Northern Pass project rejected in Feb. Nfld has had aquaculture project rejected. Plans to expand offshore oil projects have been delayed. Alberta needs to stop this victim mentality.
3896 2018-12-01 22:59:21 Kind of, yeah. But we're about to celebrate a holiday where an oil lamp somehow lasted 8 nights so I feel like this is one of those times where I'm willing to accept that the universe works in mysterious ways, and 2 hour brisket is possible and delicious 
3897 2018-12-01 22:59:16 The Aesop fabulous face oil, tea tree and lemon oil. My go to 
3898 2018-12-01 22:59:10 WHERE THE HECK DID MY PARENTS PUT ALL THEIR MINYAK CAP KAPAK OR WHATEVER MEDICINAL OIL THAT THEY HAVE........
3899 2018-12-01 22:59:09 People seek a two line summation of a life. Bush 41 was CIA, Ambassador, and eye-ball deep in oil money. Ultra-elite. 
One term coat tail presidency. Perhaps more republican than Reagan. Definitely superior to his mediocre issue.
3900 2018-12-01 22:59:07 I made an appt for an oil change, when i got there, they said my appt was double booked. Then i was supposed to get my fender fixed, (my front bumper got ruined when it snowed), but when I took my car in, they said the part didn’t arrive till Monday now!
3901 2018-12-01 22:59:05 #Oil #OOTT #WTI 
Any decisive moves of WTI won't happen until post #OPEC+ meeting in #Vienna on 12/6 when a solid number of cut is announced.
3902 2018-12-01 22:58:57 You’re confused. Wells can be drilled vertical or horizontal. And both vertical or horizontal wells can be hydraulically fractured. There’s no technical difference. WA has hundreds of onshore hydraulically fractured oil wells (also producing gas btw). Safely done since 1950s.
3903 2018-12-01 22:58:53 It figures, only a few, back what you veiw, I do. The cost to the oil ; UPON YOU. The planet at large has no voice , only reaction to our excavating, and retracting the liquid natural ballests of the PLANET . Why are there earthquakes? Duh.
3904 2018-12-01 22:58:51 News for you...Banning oil drilling in some areas is not the same as closing existing offshore drilling.
No POTUS has produced more oil, gas than Obama

“These action & Canada’s parallel actions, protect a sensitive and unique ecosystem that is unlike any other region on Earth,”
3905 2018-12-01 22:58:42 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
3906 2018-12-01 22:58:30 They refuse to acknowledge the fact that oil will used for centuries to come regardless how many "Electric Unicorns" are on the highways.
3907 2018-12-01 22:58:26 You tell me ! I believe the earthquake occurred miles under the earth surface. Oil wells don't drill down that far!
3908 2018-12-01 22:58:21 If u just throw it in the oven and put it in a lil bit high heat yes... used to do it wen I was in school.
Then rub some oil on it, it ll be like dodo
3909 2018-12-01 22:58:06 The Lakonta maple syrup was disgusting - IMHO - but I also find that the MCT oil gives me a weird aftertaste to some things for a while.
3910 2018-12-01 22:58:06 America is the worlds largest oil producer but also a net importer.

We have fucked up so bad.
3911 2018-12-01 22:57:53 AMAZING FEATS OF SCIENCE- OLIVE OIL AND FRED FLINTSTONE COMBINED????
3912 2018-12-01 22:57:51 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth  over. - Psalm 23:5 #Bible
3913 2018-12-01 22:57:50 BTW, for those playing along at home, Byrne was working for oil tycoon and intel asset Tom Slick who employed anthropologists Osman Hill and Agogino in his yeti hunting, and OSS anthropologist Carelton Coon was also in the mix, see the work of @tarbosaur
3914 2018-12-01 22:57:44 There is an infinite supply of electricity, until the sun dies. Whereas oil *will* run out.
3915 2018-12-01 22:57:33 UPDATED = Bloomberg BS added in?
Oil -50c and updated updated article will read “Russia and Saudis fail to agree on the size of the cut”
3916 2018-12-01 22:57:29 I got new tires and an oil change... I’m ready for my Cali trip!! Woot
3917 2018-12-01 22:57:19 お疲れ様ですー。昨日はありがとうございましたー！
3918 2018-12-01 22:57:16 Yes, those involved with Big Oil certainly act entitled.
3919 2018-12-01 22:57:14 just use loads of coconut oil, it’ll speed it up
3920 2018-12-01 22:57:05 Tbh it looks to be over and done with after this G20. Putin and MbS all but spelled it out that they are now crushing shale oil. They can both live with Oil between 20-30$ pB for a year or two. HYG cannot. Near term Gold target 1300-1800 $/oz assuming GOR 60 /w Oil at 20-30$.
3921 2018-12-01 22:56:59 Oh, that must mean we canceled our arms contract with them, we’re not buying more Saudi oil and construction on Energy East starts Monday. Anything less and Trudeau is a spineless poser.
3922 2018-12-01 22:56:57 Good to hear it is not about resources. So basically a Syrian company could in theory develop and mine oil/gas/minerals on the #GolanHeights w/o
banging on the war drum. Theoretically, skipping the #realpolitik song and dance, that is.
3923 2018-12-01 22:56:42 Lol. You are wrong. Trump got the Saudi’s to buy billions of military equipment, provides security as we work w the crown prince and best of all lowered oil prices. If that’s not enough, you need your head examined. Trump wins again. @realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo @LouDobbs
3924 2018-12-01 22:56:39 , this was during the summer so my skin was very radiant at the time but I usually just scrub my face every  morning/night & use vitamin e oil to moisturize
3925 2018-12-01 22:56:35 Also, as tall and slender as you are, a sash— even a grosgrain ribbon in navy— would be charming on that dress. I’m built like an oil drum, so sashes and belts are no bueno, but you can get away with it and show off your waist.
3926 2018-12-01 22:56:32 I asked him to pick up my car today and he did , got a oil change , washed my car and inspected it 
3927 2018-12-01 22:56:30 I think EUR was merely designed to be attractive to Arab oil exporter creditors of EU in which to sell oil.  Problem is that requires a “harder” currency than what southern EU prefers.
3928 2018-12-01 22:56:27 Give your head a shake. We have been doing this for a long time we run some of the safest pipelines. When there is a spill it is clean and contained asap.  Remember BP oil rig in the gulf ? Is it “ destroyed “ nope cleaned asap.
3929 2018-12-01 22:56:19 chicken oil
3930 2018-12-01 22:56:15 On my face, and on a dry spot on my scalp. Coconut oil is very healthy for hair as well- recommended on the tips of the hair.
3931 2018-12-01 22:55:46 Lots of oil for this war criminal in hell.
3932 2018-12-01 22:55:40 Obama championed renewable clean energy Trump has dismantled federal programs for clean energy Oil is a finite commodity China is the world's leading country in electricity production from renewable energy sources; US is second China smart Trump a dumbass @realDonaldTrump
3933 2018-12-01 22:55:31 Actually my followers prefer olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
3934 2018-12-01 22:55:24 You keep forgetting that you have all handed AB over to the Muslims, right where the oil is.  Dont you see it!  Useless!

3937 2018-12-01 22:55:09 the key to life = coconut oil
3938 2018-12-01 22:55:09 Kenney & Scheer are not Easterners. They are from central Canada (Ontario specifically) which is east of you but not Eastern Canada. As a group, Eastern Canada has repudiated the CPC. I work in the oil patch & can affirm that Suncor didn’t build Fort Hills. The Colombians did.
3939 2018-12-01 22:55:04 The guy that wrote that crap, Kenneth Green, is a Fraser Institute professional  bullshittist. Fraser Institute is funded by the corporate oil and gas lobby who pays for such BS to be published, to fool people like you. You are being easily fooled and led astray by propagandists.
3940 2018-12-01 22:54:59 Nice.

However, because of the long distance (Oil price)and the economie situation and the brexit....it is better
To focus your efforts more by creating a new relations with the power and rich countries and bring with you a real contracts not just illusions!!

Cheers.


3941 2018-12-01 22:54:52 You use coconut oil on your head?
Isnt that a mess?...lol
3942 2018-12-01 22:54:28 You lit a match in an oil field my friend, expect the fire to spread.
3943 2018-12-01 22:54:25 Sohi, is just kidding, they still want to shut down the oil industry, the Appalachian mafia do not want a prosperous Alberta. Justin is just finishing what Pierre started
3944 2018-12-01 22:54:18 Trump is a toxic waste dump. Yet while you smile appovingly at the neoliberal pretty boy Trudeau, he's busy selling off Native lands for dirty oil sands pipelines.

3946 2018-12-01 22:53:21 Dubya wasn’t president. Daddy was & gave mixed signals to Saddam. BTW the whole ME shtbag is 100% West’s fault. It’s always about the oil. Since 19th century.
3947 2018-12-01 22:52:46 I was a high school senior when the first Gulf War started. Even at Redneck High School some of us were chanting No Blood For Oil. We didn’t want to see our friends die. Our history teacher registered us all to vote. 41 can burn in Hell.

3958 2018-12-01 22:51:05 Trump Tower deal was dropped June 15th. Does Rachel explain why? By June 15, it was clear Trump would be the Republican nominee. Maybe Trump saw possibility of a bigger prize than real estate in having sanctions lifted —namely, a stake in Russia’s state owned oil company /1
3959 2018-12-01 22:50:58 Wonder how oil reacts to this given Purim clearly said he’s fine with current prices

3965 2018-12-01 22:50:40 Putin is getting desperate again, & needs to stir up "crises" to divert attention from the domestic economy. Unmentioned in the talk of $50 oil is that Russia needs about double that to fund government spending
3966 2018-12-01 22:50:38 Bush should have done more to free our nation & planet from the grip of Big Oil.
He failed us miserably in this matter; & now our planet faces a serious climate change crisis.
I hope our children & grandchildren will have a healthy planet to live on.
3967 2018-12-01 22:50:25 The blame falls fully on AB for, they kept that useless PC party in power for 44 yrs. the Oil industry their only concern when Oil prices bottomed out and the industry failed there was nowhere else to turn, diversification wasn't term they understood and it will get worse.

3978 2018-12-01 22:48:59 Let's not forget the Bush was an oil man. He allowed horrible stuff to happen to the environment. I don't want to hear what a nice guy he was even if he is dead
3979 2018-12-01 22:48:52 Looks like an oil painting

3984 2018-12-01 22:48:41 “Would Justin Trudeau ever say we need to phase out manufacturing jobs? Banking jobs? Creative jobs? No, of course not,” Leitch wrote. “Why does he insist on being hostile to our energy sector?”

Dumbass Leitch here, it's about oil not energy. Oil is not our only energy sector.
3985 2018-12-01 22:48:38 That would soon knock a few zeros off some unrealistically inflated salaries and transfer fees and reality check some oil sheiks for example
3986 2018-12-01 22:48:37 OMD same!!
I used to imagine baby oil extraction factories kinda like how they get venom from snakes 
3987 2018-12-01 22:48:19 OmO also sorry to butt in but coconut oil/Olive oil + white sugar is a good @ home alternative for lip exfoliation. I seriously second the laneige mask tho it saved me
3988 2018-12-01 22:48:14 Girl I can relate . Find you a good moisturizer, oil &’ don’t shrink .., you really have to train your hair to do what you want it to do tbh .., 
3989 2018-12-01 22:48:10 The smart economic decision would be to invest a set a % of oil revenues towards alternative fuels, thus the stronger the oil industry becomes  the stronger the alternative industries become.
3990 2018-12-01 22:48:04 So again: do you believe that the simple fact that researchers get paid to research is sufficient evidence that almost all climate researchers (except those getting paid directly by oil companies) are venal lying scum who prefer to make things up rather than actually do science?
3991 2018-12-01 22:47:55 I am a regular shopper and prices have written, that's what I have noticed. I have less disposable income. If this gets any worse, people better off people than me will start feeling it. British people hit in the pocket, tend to think very carefully who is selling them snake oil.
3992 2018-12-01 22:47:51 my car needs an oil change, new tires, and who knows what else, fml. 
3993 2018-12-01 22:47:50 The National Post has a big fat American hedge fund with deep pockets to protect its American style capitalism and its PR for big oil. They always whine about the CBC and put on the appearance of being a Canadian newspaper
3994 2018-12-01 22:47:49 Lucas Oil Stadium is testing out the pregame footage for the entrances. One problem? The video has Michigan instead of Ohio State.

Perhaps we wouldn't be facing the serious climate change crisis unfolding right now.

Let's hope our grandkids will survive this crisis.
4003 2018-12-01 22:46:48 The way Man Utd are going down, they will soon discover oil. Just relaying the message
4004 2018-12-01 22:46:45 How about we kill the ppl exploring for gas and oil instead
4005 2018-12-01 22:46:42 Like what? Be the Law & Order candidate who would self-finance his campaign? Build a wall that Mexico would pay for? Break up big banks? Take oil from Iraq? What about that $1 trillion infrastructure package. Raise taxes on the rich? Trump has done nothing but fill the swamp.
4006 2018-12-01 22:46:28 Well none I f those idiots in the Majlis know anything about economics or the price of a barrel of oil or the fact that the regime is bartering to stay afloat. Pulling the wool over each other’s eyes 
4007 2018-12-01 22:46:02 Over consump. of resources MUST stop.  Accountability at producers end, beginning with government limits.

4011 2018-12-01 22:45:34 We know if you're out of UK for 9 mths in 1 year you have no tax so smart guys fly home from oil rig to Dublin, take train to Belfast & ferry to Stranraer. Guy I know does 3mth on/3 off so on 1 of his 2 home visits he takes this route & he qualifies & he is tax free.
4012 2018-12-01 22:45:28 Silly headline - Saudi Arabia is an oil rich dictatorship with no tax payers to be accountable to.
4013 2018-12-01 22:45:23 Please give us the FACTS, not the lies and innuendo we have rammed down our throats. There are many alternatives to both coal and oil - exploit them, not the planet.
4014 2018-12-01 22:45:21 We Iranian people need international support to bring the brutal regime of Iran down. The revenues from oil and gas should be spent for people of Iran...

4020 2018-12-01 22:44:08 It doesn’t sound like anyone is saying oil or Israel or US interests were a zero part of decisions. Just that they weren’t the deciding factor, or the primary motivation, for GHWB.
4021 2018-12-01 22:43:50 Those were a few PANISTAS. The're an embarrassment to Mexicans. Those idiots voted to privatize the mexican oil to make gasoline cheaper which never happened , & just before raising this banner they had signs demanding cheaper gasoline. AMLO called them out on their foolishness.
4022 2018-12-01 22:43:48 George was holding a can of oil, so we can’t be sure who he was talking to
4023 2018-12-01 22:43:45 Bush was loyal to oil,  which was a peace maker. 
We've all moved on (what Bush did, set up 9/11) 
You've got a big in your face, drop the mike, corrupt thing and clan to clear up.

4026 2018-12-01 22:43:36 lol hey
4027 2018-12-01 22:43:15 Really?  Specifically,  how?  US is top oil producer in the world & oil prices are down, which hurts both Russia & Saudi Arabia. More sanctions now on Russia than before DJT in office.

Please enlighten US on the rationale for your statement?

Democrats are #liars & #hypocrites.
4028 2018-12-01 22:43:15 I have a complaint that they are amoral institutions who invest in the world most agregious enterprises, including oil pipelines that are adding to our imminent demise w climate change. They should be regulated more to ensure they implement fair & environmentally just investments
4029 2018-12-01 22:42:52 Sure. I do really like Clinique Moisture Surge Intense for Dry Skin. You can even layer a good facial oil underneath when it gets really cold out.
4030 2018-12-01 22:42:44 @RepAnnWagner @RoyBlunt @McCaskillOffice: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast
4031 2018-12-01 22:42:40 Yes because unfortunately, oil is what partly drives our success, and in return, artificially inflates the value of our dollar. The establishment will do anything it can (besides removing the fiat dollar, since they want to maintain power) to prevent a default scenario.
4032 2018-12-01 22:42:36 Put leave-in conditioner and a little oil in your hair. Then wrap it in a towel for a few minutes and damn. Softness for dayssss
4033 2018-12-01 22:42:21 Applesauce can be a serviceable replacement for oil, butter, or eggs in a recipe. Texture changes but flavor usually holds. ALSO IF THERE ARE NO EGGS IN THE HOUSE AND I WANT TO BAKE COOKIES I AM DOING IT.
4034 2018-12-01 22:42:20 I don't even think they see it as just the death button. Take oil for example, leftists were mad at Obama this week because he was proud of raising US oil production and making the country energy independent. They fundamentally refuse to recognize that as a legitimate position
4035 2018-12-01 22:42:02 Funny you tweet 10% @MPelletierCIO as #Alberta friend hears 400K/day which a) would be huge, & b) hit your 10% #oil cuts
4036 2018-12-01 22:41:49 I suppose Trudeau is responsible for the narrow market conditions under which oil sands are profitable? I suppose he's responsible for the immense investments required to make it work? Do you really think riling up Albertans will make you Prime Minister? Yeesh.
4037 2018-12-01 22:41:45 He talked about changing oil in your car and a reference to John Short as well.  
4038 2018-12-01 22:41:42 Russia & Saudi Arabia have agreed to extend their agreement on oil production cuts, which is timely with the pending OPEC meeting on Dec 6.  Now just trump to deal with to reduce oil supply and stablise price.

4040 2018-12-01 22:41:26 Demand for heavy is falling. Supplies of all kinds of oil are rising. 
Continuing to fight in a race to the bottom when our break even point is 4-5 times larger than our competition is stupid. Discount on light oil doesn't matter the cost is low. $11 oil is profitable for Saudi

Zero lettuce @ Whole Foods & Trader Joe's,  just Spinach, Arugula, etc. So afraid of lawsuits that they've pulled all types of the green stuff, even though only Romaine was recalled? WTF?
4052 2018-12-01 22:40:29 Give me a break. I don't buy snake oil.
4053 2018-12-01 22:40:22 Jones is apparently suffering a nervous breakdown due to permanent and enforced social media isolation complicated by a chronic addiction to his own snake oil supplements. 

This performance isn't funny, it's actually deeply disturbing.
4054 2018-12-01 22:40:18 Lithium is gonna be a problem.  Seeking new reserves, means higher prices.  Much like oil it will require expensive exploration and mining.  It's no silver bullet
4055 2018-12-01 22:40:13 How long has @CadburyUK's chocolate been made with palm oil?
4056 2018-12-01 22:40:09 World economic trends? Canadian oil selling for $17 versus $50 is because of the lack of pipelines.
4057 2018-12-01 22:40:05 Well, I typically start with Olive Oil in a hot wok; Grated Red Onions, Grated Garlic (LOTS of it), Grated Fresh Ginger, Chopped fresh chilies, Sauté for few minutes. Then add whatever takes your fancy. I keep it simple.....Fresh coriander, Coconut Milk, Tomatoes...

That shit's intense, you could clean a bench with that stuff
4060 2018-12-01 22:39:37 Never once have I said all right wing people are angry or assholes but there sure as shit is a lot of them. Businesses come and go in Calgary and everywhere, but the writing is on the wall for the oil industry and it says, "It's never going to be like the old times again."
4061 2018-12-01 22:39:36 Yes, and it was Obama who made us one of the leaders in the oil industry, right? Your idol repeated many times that Americans didn’t accomplish anything on their own...except for him, according to him,and believed by you.
4062 2018-12-01 22:39:30 george h.w bush died? anyways, avacado oil makes my curls look outstanding. 10/10 would recommend.
4063 2018-12-01 22:39:30 "Oil is becoming less&less of a reason cuz we’re producing more oil now than we’ve ever produced/So,u know,all of a sudden it gets to a pt where u don’t have to stay there”what disturbs me,is the fact,extracting earth's blood in"record amts is acceptable'norm
4064 2018-12-01 22:39:04 Over production of tar sands oil, has to be shipped abroad due to lack of refineries, half a trillion in clean up cost for tailing ponds, is the highest producer of air pollution in North America.  Instead of blaming others clean up your act.  #ClimateChangeIsSerious
4065 2018-12-01 22:39:00 Man I can’t wait to pick up some fresh cooking oil and fry these wings in this new cast iron skillet. Time to break this bitch in like grandma.
4066 2018-12-01 22:38:55 Is there anything at Lucas Oil commemorating Poundcake?
4067 2018-12-01 22:38:50 Went to get an oil change and they said somn needed to be replaced every 50,000 miles, and ask did I wanna replace it now .. ion even have that many miles on my car 
4068 2018-12-01 22:38:45 i want to butt chug cbd oil
4069 2018-12-01 22:38:42 I would have voted for Clinton because I lived in a swing state. But the status quo with climate change still kills us. If Hillary wanted environmentalists to vote for her she could have proposed a green new deal, a carbon tax. Instead she took oil money and supported DAPL.
4070 2018-12-01 22:38:40 "The way Man Utd are going down, they will soon discover oil"

Next time I got it in to be investigated they said the oil pressure

4077 2018-12-01 22:37:39 Oh, you mean that “Iran Contra” integrity? Or the integrity of the first Iraq War, after OK’ing Hussein’s efforts to stop Kuwait’s theft of Iraqi oil? Or perhaps the integrity he displayed when he refused  to apologize for American fighters shooting down an Iranian passenger jet?

I feel like a brand new bitch
4084 2018-12-01 22:37:17 I guess it’s a clear sign that you live in #PortlandME when you hear CBD you don’t think of the hemp oil, you think of @CBDportland...
4085 2018-12-01 22:37:14 And, in the last few weeks, Alberta has moved into crisis mode with the differential on oil pricing. The combination has raised the story again, with more fervour. Rightly so in my opinion.

4088 2018-12-01 22:37:06 I don't have new phone money. Tf you think I am? An oil magnate?
4089 2018-12-01 22:36:58 Hey Jason their seems to be a certain element of glee in your tweet! The tone of today’s O&G was set over 44 years when  Conservatives provided leadership; Develop oil sands create marketable oil production & take it to market Funny thing happened no one knew Alta was landlocked!
4090 2018-12-01 22:36:35 They are finally getting sick of the whole global warming BS !They tryed to make gas so expensive no one can afford to drive,There is a ton of oil and no reason,Happy to see the French rise up about something finally !! They didn’t seem affected by the Muslims raping their kids

4092 2018-12-01 22:36:30 not sure off hand. there is oil inside to help dissipate any power and to ensure there are no hot spots.
4093 2018-12-01 22:36:25 Man...If you like butter pecan ice cream, I assume you watch Gunsmoke under a light quilt that smells like liniment oil year round.

Bonus points if you consider the 8 o'clock news the "late" edition.
4094 2018-12-01 22:36:16 Maybe the oil waiver will not last..
4095 2018-12-01 22:36:14 Because attacking Iraq for oil, is so boy next door.

4097 2018-12-01 22:36:07 C PCs new slogan help big oil forget about your grandchildren
4098 2018-12-01 22:36:06 I'm starting to think he's a snake oil salesman. He's talks a great game. But his lineups and offense suck and it's starting to look like it's not "experimentation" that accounts for it.
4099 2018-12-01 22:35:49 Just be strong and assertive or ask a friend to change your oil I prefer to do my own oil change cause I know they give me a bunch of bogus on stuff that I know I don’t need
4100 2018-12-01 22:35:41 Why do they have to use any palm oil? Surely it's possible to make these vile little things without any at all.
4101 2018-12-01 22:35:35 Thanks I didn’t want to lose too much length. Just waiting for my beard oil and utility bar to come now. 
Keep it growing!!!
4102 2018-12-01 22:35:35 I think oil n gas is going to hold tight till the election. It’s getting stupid out there
4103 2018-12-01 22:35:28 Jacobean finished with oil base
4104 2018-12-01 22:35:20 I think crude supply dynamics have changed forever. There's always going to be more oil that can be produced than consumed - the winners will be those that can do it cheapest/most efficiently/with the least environmental impact.
4105 2018-12-01 22:35:11 Chidi chidi the prof  una dey oil ya pot of stew. Na the only business wey you sabi jare.
4106 2018-12-01 22:35:10 Try am Nah, Shebi you dey use red oil, we go see..... But it's possible, you can do it if you want to
4107 2018-12-01 22:35:04 my snake oil ex roommate got me hooked on d*terra deep blue rub bc it’s the only thing that isn’t THC balm that touches my back spasms
4108 2018-12-01 22:34:31 how about all those oil digging and exploration which we cant see and the effect of taking out billions of tons of oil effecting continental crust which is far worse than just holes in them
4109 2018-12-01 22:34:29 Oil & gas disruption is hard to predict:
 Solar & Wind are now the cheapest form of bulk energy (not 100% reliable)
 Batteries are getting exponentially cheaper (Its mining  not good)
 Autonomous + electric + connected + shared vehicles (= way more cars on the road )
4110 2018-12-01 22:34:27 Journalists forgot George Bush Jr is an artist... you torture an artist by giving the visual new meaning unless revealed.  Find the industry participating outside of oil and gas
4111 2018-12-01 22:34:17 Remember the production cut for Alberta wouldn't mean less oil being exported. Export of oil would still be increasing using CBR and ramping up mid'19 on line 3.
4112 2018-12-01 22:34:14 It's finally December, boys and girls! Let's make it a nice white and creamy one, yeah? Time to bust 
4113 2018-12-01 22:34:06 Hope you are doing well, Sir!
Bush should have done more to free us from the grip of Big Oil.
Perhaps the climate change crisis wouldn't have been this dire, had he acted with more integrity.
4114 2018-12-01 22:34:04 Gotta use some beard oil
4115 2018-12-01 22:34:01 Can anyone recommend a good beard oil? (Asking for a friend)

4117 2018-12-01 22:33:59 Smooth feet 
-Use Vaseline or coconut oil and massage into your feet before bed. Put on thick layers. Then put socks on and remove the next morning.
4118 2018-12-01 22:33:54 Same situation with the oil bottle.  Either it flew off by it self or was on the edge for the entire time though I didn’t pay attention to it. 
4119 2018-12-01 22:33:35 The global warming war on oil, gas and coal is what is really racist.  While green energy needs to be developed, it should be done with care given to consumer cost.  Making oil cost rise b4 green becomes cheaper hurts poor more than climate change

4122 2018-12-01 22:33:28 Oh nooo! Don’t use something your skin isn’t used to- will likely make it worse or bring out more oil for your skin which’ll create more acne. Use acne specific treatments + the sun will hopefully help to clear your skin too 
4123 2018-12-01 22:33:24 cardboard and motor oil

4125 2018-12-01 22:33:14 Oh sorry. I have an essential oil for that 
4126 2018-12-01 22:33:12 OK, I'm convinced. Fizdale is a snake oil salesman.  He talks a good game but his lineups and offense are crap.
4127 2018-12-01 22:33:03 All that oil and brine, yeah, it’s true.
4128 2018-12-01 22:32:50 Lol
You're never satisfied my g
4129 2018-12-01 22:32:44 Whenever I start to feel like I’ve got a grip on things, there’s suddenly oil on the handlebars
4130 2018-12-01 22:32:44 It’s not really a combo but I mix olive oil with my unscented lotion and my skin be soft and moisturized
4131 2018-12-01 22:32:27 Ginger what? Ginger ale? Ginger the movie star? Ginger essential oil? Ginger candy? Ginger supplements? A friend of a friend named Ginger who I actually didn’t like?  GINGER WHAT?!?
4132 2018-12-01 22:32:12 You may be right but, yes a but. Smoking anything into your lungs is not healthy. Medicinal use as an oil or however it’s administered is acceptable.
4133 2018-12-01 22:32:10 They know global oil prices have dropped reducing costs right?  I’m not sure how much the tax increase is, however this seems silly. 

I also wonder how many don’t actually have vehicles.....
4134 2018-12-01 22:32:10 One thing to think about. Alberta's oil industry doesn't only come from the oilsands.

Millions of small well sites dot the landscape.  That is the oil flowing into the pipelines.

We do need industry to change to renewable energy sources but they need to remain solvent to do so.
4135 2018-12-01 22:32:09 Oil will be replaced? Gas and renewable energy...
4136 2018-12-01 22:31:57 Sort of like having your charity purchase an oil painting?
4137 2018-12-01 22:31:46 You may be able to pick up some oil for the much required beard around there.
4138 2018-12-01 22:31:42 Can someone with expertise in this area, explain under what authority the province of Alberta can cut oil production. Thank you.
@WBrettWilson @trevortombe
4139 2018-12-01 22:31:22 Leftist in France have instituted a carbon tax to reduce oil and gasoline usage. Govt in France has decided that people must drive less and use mass transit. Liberal utopia. 
4140 2018-12-01 22:31:06 I believe that the Leafs D corps in 2020 will look like Reilly, dermott, Lilgren, sandin, Holl, Zaitsev, and Rosen. Leafs are a way more complete team than the Oil
4141 2018-12-01 22:31:06 I have this stubborn Taurus block that holds things in that alt past timeline you spent the last line basically just a Friend of Russia oil guy and POTUS Son in Law bombing ppl?
4142 2018-12-01 22:31:02 I can honestly tell you that Kenney would have forced Trudeau hand! His opposition speeches said as much!! Stop the oil to the east & west, stop trade with B.C., stop LNG exports to B.C. Notley did no of that, she had a wine embargo for a month!!
4143 2018-12-01 22:30:55 Don't be misguided so that you won't get a wrong conclusion. Don't embark on fault finding but fact finding. Regardless of debt, Osun wouldn't have taking 6m if not for national recession. revenue for d entire country fell as oil fell to about 30$ pb from over 100$pb.
4144 2018-12-01 22:30:41 i just made,,,,, an olive oil and chocolate cake,,,,, lets see how it is i always wanted to try this recipe out
4145 2018-12-01 22:30:40 Right you are Jack.
The last vote we had a referendum on just that. All gas tax money must be put to the roads first. I don't know how it came out - but I don't put much faith in it. I often tell the anit-gas and oil people try doing without it
4146 2018-12-01 22:30:40 Not sure how hot it is there now, but when we went to the Dead Sea the beach was hot enough to put blisters on your feet, the water feels like oil.
4147 2018-12-01 22:30:37 when walmart lies about how long an oil change will take...smh i need to go to work people!!!!!!!
4148 2018-12-01 22:30:36 I'm just BBQing chicken, weather is nice here today and tomorrow. Try to bbq all year.  keep shoveling in backyard for bbq. It pays off. Bbq food way more healthier than cooked in oil stuff
4149 2018-12-01 22:30:28 utin Confirms No New Oil Production Cuts; Hopes For US, UK Detente
 
Russian President Vladimir Putin praised Trump, pummeled Poroshenko, and poured cold water on oil market bulls' hopes in a statement following the G-20 meetings.
4150 2018-12-01 22:30:27 With all due respect sir,  fall in oil money didn't stop the sharing of money to the states... And each state got their allocations,  more so,  each state struggling with salaries were even given bail out funds,  to be honest with you sir,  there is no way you can convince me...
4151 2018-12-01 22:30:26 At the end of the day.  We on the way to see my mans @TheTerry_25 get in the end zone a few times in Lucas Oil.  Nun New
4152 2018-12-01 22:30:21 Imagine how well off we'd be right now if we had a proper provincial tax structure in place before the oil booms...
4153 2018-12-01 22:30:21 Decided to take some oil of oregano capsules because I've heard folks have had good luck improving SIBO with them, and dang dude, all I can say is it's a good thing I like the taste of oregano!!
4154 2018-12-01 22:30:08 くろすけ。

4157 2018-12-01 22:29:54 Definitely going to the green truck after I get my oil changed
4158 2018-12-01 22:29:42 If you are truly committed to the environment why arent you protesting the millions of barrels if oil being imported every day?
4159 2018-12-01 22:29:27 Its not that folks can not say otherwise but the pain of having no light for a long period scares the hell out of everyone that they just succumb to pay for the transformers... Worse still, PHCN will say the same community should contribute money for oil...
4160 2018-12-01 22:29:26 あうあ好きです
4161 2018-12-01 22:29:19 Bush should have done more to free our nation & the world from the grip of Big Oil.
If he & all POTUS after him had weaned us off Big Oil, our planet would not be facing this serious climate change crisis right now.
Hope our children's & grandchildren's generations will be OK.

4163 2018-12-01 22:29:13 1814-1817 he was self-taught for oil painting working with
 Caspar David Friedrich **.
4164 2018-12-01 22:29:08 Why, are you going to give credit for hi oil production 2 guy who has spent 150+ days on golf course with nary peep of criticism?
4165 2018-12-01 22:29:05 We had baby potatos  last night and had a vote whether to toss in butter or olive oil.  Butter won.
4166 2018-12-01 22:29:03 The threat was bogus. Canada has the secondest largest oil deposits after Saudi. So it is silly to even use oil on us. Saudi recalling all their students & medics is laughable. How many Canadians lne up to study in Saudi Arabia?
If Rwanda wants to be fully independent, ditch aid
4167 2018-12-01 22:28:58 Qatar is rich with only oil, how many minerals do we have? Diamonds, Gold, Platinum, Uranium etc, we would have easily been the richest in the world... but then apartheid happened and then ANC, time for change? EFF
4168 2018-12-01 22:28:52 Canadian Oil being devastated by federal Liberals... these aren’t just Albertan jobs, they are Canadian jobs and revenues
4169 2018-12-01 22:28:51 Agreed!

Alberta's oil industry has been badly managed since the beginning.  I also believe that things need to change environmentally. We have not been protecting our land, water or our wildlife. 

I believe that @RachelNotley knows & will act accordingly.
4170 2018-12-01 22:28:35 So you’re good with  pursuing oil and pipelines?
4171 2018-12-01 22:28:34 Or, Stay n for 5 minutes with a bottle of baby oil and a box of tissues, while watching Mrs Brown!!!
4172 2018-12-01 22:28:33 Snake oil salesmen have a fascinating history. I hear these modern day miracle concoctions are also excellent for dropsy.
4173 2018-12-01 22:28:14 What he took us to war for oil!!!!!
4174 2018-12-01 22:28:13 Hope you did an oil change, too! Or at least topped off. X3
4175 2018-12-01 22:28:09 When the hooks and tempura oil come out you know you're in for a bad day...
4176 2018-12-01 22:28:05 Pay provincial sales taxes in Alberta instead of bleating about no money because of low oil $. For years you drained the Heritage Fund to offset the treasury loss of income. Instead of being like Norway and investing the money, you wasted it bragging about no PST. #Our_Next_NFWD
4177 2018-12-01 22:28:02 You’re outstandingly delusional.
IF ANYTHING her inactivity while Trudeau put NEW REGULATIONS on Energy EAST forcing Enbridge to walk away! @RachelNotley sited “social licensing” the NEW price of doing oil business!! Her WORDS!! Notley is responsible for 100,000 lost jobs!
4178 2018-12-01 22:27:42 “Modern-day realities such as free trade agreements and integrated oil sands operations would make it far more complicated to simply institute a quota system. Any decision would need be made thoughtfully and respect the orderly regulation of today’s oil and gas sector.”
4179 2018-12-01 22:27:35 I love robotic oil poffins~!
4180 2018-12-01 22:27:28 I think you mean “May I vape olive oil?”
4181 2018-12-01 22:27:27 I love M&S but honestly? I prefer them without Palm Oil! Or made with Sustainable Palm Oil If must
4182 2018-12-01 22:27:24 @chigrl Was the fact that she was going to make a decsion in regards of canadian oil production on sunday was known earlier? Thanks!
4183 2018-12-01 22:27:19 So Kochs can take all of Venezuela’s dirty oil for free...
4184 2018-12-01 22:27:12 Exxon itself did the first studies and came to the same conclusions back in the 60's. Then spent hundreds of millions making sure no one did anything about it because they sell oil. There is NO valid peer reviewed science that says otherwise. Including our own governments.
4185 2018-12-01 22:26:58 Bumble and bumble invisible oil primer
4186 2018-12-01 22:26:53 It’s called oil and pipelines
4187 2018-12-01 22:26:50 Hooray for rainbow swamps! For completely natural reasons (unrelated to oil) as well, so it's even better.
4188 2018-12-01 22:26:48 Thanks bro! I need to buy a new primer or invest in a sponge to absorb all this oil lol
4189 2018-12-01 22:26:24 フィルタで遊ぶの面白い！
4190 2018-12-01 22:26:22 My mum needs to because of the neighbour who turns psycho sometimes. We’ve got literal shit in front of our door, baking oil and other stuff. And we’ve had no proof since we’ve had no camera. But since they are installed, it stopped.

4192 2018-12-01 22:26:00 They do, but cash is light. Hoping this CBD oil can get me through til I can get the store
4193 2018-12-01 22:25:37 we are talking about bush sr not trump although they are all the same. how was your health impacted in the oil wars?
4194 2018-12-01 22:25:33 Dahsyat penangan nescafe ni. Dari pkul 9 sampai pukul 6. Burn the midnight oil betul ni 
4195 2018-12-01 22:25:28 ...and 21,000 new oil and gas drilling permits in California.
4196 2018-12-01 22:25:16 you poor thing. I usually use an argon oil infused dye. it smells soooo good. but it dyes EVERYTHING XD
4197 2018-12-01 22:25:06 Black Seed Oil Look It Up
4198 2018-12-01 22:25:03 Find out the total money shared in that month by the whole country and compare it with the same month of the previous year. That is how to be a dutiful researcher. If I can assist u, d reason was that revenue for d entire country fell as oil fell to about 30$ pb from over 100$pb.
4199 2018-12-01 22:25:00 And the wind whispers “Zapata Oil ...”
4200 2018-12-01 22:24:51 why does everything have palm oil in it??? like most of the time it’s just a completely useless additive,, major corporations rly wanna destroy the planet don’t they
4201 2018-12-01 22:24:48 How’s:
1. Steel tariffs
2. Aluminium tariffs 
3. Oil pipelines
4. Condemning Hamas
5. Condemning Cuba
6. Condemning Antisemites
7. Condemning SA
8. Securing our borders 
9. Protecting Canadian Resources sector from Tides/Leadnow/Rockefeller attacks 
10. Picking a new Lib Leader?
4202 2018-12-01 22:24:43 Whoa....Saudi Wahhabism has been at work since oil began to flow.
4203 2018-12-01 22:24:41 since i've been unable to sleep for three consecutive nights we're doing this the old fashioned way: sage-ing the fuck out of my room and dripping a shitload of lavender oil on my pillow case
4204 2018-12-01 22:24:39 キリコ
4205 2018-12-01 22:24:23 The BBC tribute to Geoege H Bush implied that he was a self made multi mullionaire in the oil industry. Forgot to mention he got a few million from Daddy Prescott who made a few bucks financing Nazi Germany @ georgegalloway
4206 2018-12-01 22:24:20 He’s the land commissioner. Think of all that oil and gas beneath public lands
4207 2018-12-01 22:24:19 -Another excuse for big government to take away my freedom!
-What freedom? Are you an oil company?
-Well, what if I sexually identify as an oil company? Isn’t that what you liberals think? My identity is valid!
4208 2018-12-01 22:24:15 the way man utd is going down, they would soon discover crude oil 
4209 2018-12-01 22:24:15 Me, chopping veggies like a pro “cooking is great!” 
*sees olive oil is 5 dollars per milliliter 
Me-“cooking sucks, actually”
4210 2018-12-01 22:24:06 I don’t use either. Mayo has protein in it (my hair hates protein) and Olive oil is too heavy for my hair. It’s complicated all in its own 
4211 2018-12-01 22:24:04 Weird question, but if the captain of an EPL team is from a country where they frown on LGBTQ peeps will he still be made to put on the rainbow armband?
4212 2018-12-01 22:24:03 Apparently dole whips have coconut oil in them. RIP me
4213 2018-12-01 22:24:01 CBD dosing is a major issue. As is quality control. Much of what is being g sold is snake oil
4214 2018-12-01 22:23:59 @RepTipton @SenBennetCO @SenCoryGardner: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast

4216 2018-12-01 22:23:46 I care as much about his passing as he cared for those with AIDS. And his family was made beyond wealthy by oil, why do you think he and his boy got off on injecting our country into Iraq?
4217 2018-12-01 22:23:43 They are looking for mink oil
4218 2018-12-01 22:23:40 there's something called a perfume oil too but I didn't fancy that
4219 2018-12-01 22:23:31 We import most of our oil from Canada, and yet Trump is an ass to Trudeau.
4220 2018-12-01 22:23:29 Totally agree. The list goes on, involvement with the Carlyle Group, Saudis, dodgy oil companies, Gulf War, CIA rubbish - real moving......
4221 2018-12-01 22:23:12 "At the other end of the performance table are Mercer Group, NZ Refining, Steel & Tube and NZ Oil & Gas, all worth less than they were at the end of 1993."
- Brian Gaynor.

Is this the true indicator of sunset industries perhaps?
4222 2018-12-01 22:23:02 Retroactive daily #weathering tip: for oil paints, unlike acrylics, do look in the oil brush section for those, as they are more resistant to the thinners that you need to use. #modeltrains #modelrailroad
4223 2018-12-01 22:23:01 Africans are not immune. Do you remember months ago, Canada was embroiled in dilomatic spat with Saudi over Human Rights.
Saudi recalled all their students, medics who were training here. They issued a statement that oil would not be affected. Our PM @JustinTrudeau remained true.
4224 2018-12-01 22:23:00 Trump was such a light-weight on Iran and he came up with all talk, doesn't want the oil price to spike, so perhaps Khamenei feels immune to return to his muscle flexing.  Until concrete action is truly taken on Iran (as "promised"), why should their regime fear the Trump admin?
4225 2018-12-01 22:22:55 The way De Gea dey drink goals, eno be crude oil that
4226 2018-12-01 22:22:53 You need a bit of gravy to oil you up Sam 
4227 2018-12-01 22:22:46 I became intolerant to :
- gasoline/Diesel fumes and scents
- oil and various fluids stains on the ground
- noisy vehicles with muffler problems
- ...

Yes, uncool it is.

When the  of perception between the EV / ICE will tilt frankly on one side it will be over for the ICE
4228 2018-12-01 22:22:29 I bought a table easel and have been wanting to get into painting. Got oil paints for my birthday,  but Idk how to use them lol.
4229 2018-12-01 22:22:26 The 50/50 oil works the best for me. Type 1 with nerve damage.
4230 2018-12-01 22:22:19 Why pretty girls act like they can’t get popped in the mouth a few times? 

Bitch mouths be slicker than a can of oil.
4231 2018-12-01 22:22:18 They do deal in large amounts of oil......
4232 2018-12-01 22:22:14 I’ve banned anything with palm oil from my house. Nutella, peanut butter, certain breads, hovis was the only bread I was able to find that didn’t use it. Absolutely horrific the amount of products that use it 
4233 2018-12-01 22:22:12 "I sexually identify as an oil company". LOL, my other favourite was the refrigerator with nothing but champagne and soy milk in it.
4234 2018-12-01 22:22:08 Phew! Lol. Makes a nice change :)
4235 2018-12-01 22:22:03 I do two folded tortillas now, with cheese. The salt and oil made a huge difference.
4236 2018-12-01 22:21:52 Plz is it a sin using anointing oil to fry eggs when u don't have any choice??? 
Need ans asap plz
4237 2018-12-01 22:21:47 Trump is on construction, not oil duh! Stay blind! Amigo!
4238 2018-12-01 22:21:41 ตื่นมาทำไมตอนนี้ กูเป็นไรเนี่ย
4239 2018-12-01 22:21:24 He also tried to save corrupt Agnew’s ass by trying to obstruct justice & trying to get the investigation into him shut down. The Bushes are corrupt. Oil blood $$. They own a huge stake of land in Brazil too to capitalize on the next most important war—water.
4240 2018-12-01 22:21:11 #Pressurewasher Tips: Always check the oil and gas levels on a gas power washer. Only use unleaded gasoline.
4241 2018-12-01 22:21:10 I dare Trudeau to come here in AB and tell it to our faces that, we hard working oil and gas or other construction workers who have contributed greatly to this great nation are nothing but trouble makers. You owe us an apology as it was us who built this nation.
4242 2018-12-01 22:21:00  I'm not that bad
4243 2018-12-01 22:20:54 But will still buy your oil while ignoring Canada’s energy industry
4244 2018-12-01 22:20:34 またやろうねーヾ(●´ω｀●)

4246 2018-12-01 22:20:29 Death of president Bush is great loss to American's. In my view he has to reply in front of GOD, about masacar of million of peoples in the name of Terrorism.i believe that we must work closer for the sake of peace not for the sake of oil. 
May Allah rest him peace
4247 2018-12-01 22:20:08 People just be eating red oil and pepper as balance diet.

 I know someone most come to say it's Yoruba people.
4248 2018-12-01 22:20:06 No idea!! I just feel like it's a $$ grab for the Oil men! 
(In my state of Michigan, our gas tax is higher than most other states. They say for road repairs, due to our winter weather. Lot's of potholes in the spring!!)
4249 2018-12-01 22:20:04 The " correct response " is to question - not to believe blindly what you are being told by a bunch of Snake Oil salesmen selling unicorns
I am however impressed that you managed to copy & paste something & I do thank you for the obvious effort you went to to click the keys
4250 2018-12-01 22:20:00 She ain’t no saint you know?! What I don’t understand with all you celeb types is your constant whinge and moan on Donald Trump, he isn’t the only terrible president to have run the USA. Where were you all when Bush sent troops into Iraq to kill innocent people and for what?! OIL
4251 2018-12-01 22:19:58 Price of wti/Brent better go higher by $15 and stay there to encourage conventional oil drilling. Slow train wreck at these prices.
4252 2018-12-01 22:19:55 Which US politicians who are backed by donor Oil and Gas are going to come out for real policy changes?
4253 2018-12-01 22:19:52 Alhamdulillah Wannan fitar jina nake kaman wani kwara Bakaga Harda wata lalita Kaman Dealern wiwi bah
4254 2018-12-01 22:19:50 I walked through a similar protest in Atlanta,I stopped and asked one of the protestors where the oilsands was located and what made its oil so evil, they knew absolutely nothing about it. Most of these people are just handed the signs and have no idea what they are protesting
4255 2018-12-01 22:19:46 맞아 다우라 언니 만나야해
4256 2018-12-01 22:19:45 Yes! You are correct. The hotel deal was only a small cherry on top. Lifting the sanctions on the oil project was the main deal. The contract Tillerson negotiated with Putin when he was at Exxon was worth almost one trillion dollars. Yes, that's trillion with a T.
4257 2018-12-01 22:19:45 i thought you was Santamaria under a new user name...
4258 2018-12-01 22:19:40 The dude went to war for oil (money).

You know, that shit we burn that destroys our atmosphere. Thoughtful is not a word that describes him.
4259 2018-12-01 22:19:36 Fuck surgery on a grape keep in mind...he drank oil from R33
4260 2018-12-01 22:19:34 I’ve never sworn on social media until now. Fuck you Bastani. Try making a decision once in your life rather than being a permanent pointless critic. He was a good President. Oil needs a fight. Wake up.
4261 2018-12-01 22:19:30 I made a Shea butter/mango butter/cocoa butter oil, & coconut oil mix & when I say my SKIN SO FAWKING SOWFFF? A nice little glow to it too??  *black girl next crook* I’m truly in love. 
4262 2018-12-01 22:19:29 The Axis of Oil is the greatest threat to western democracy today.
4263 2018-12-01 22:19:20 Yes, and apparently it goes well with coconut oil.
4264 2018-12-01 22:19:14 Beginning to think I'm truley cursed, everytime I manage to think I'm  getting ahead something always comes along to kick me in the teeth, cabs due for its plate on Monday worked my bollocks off to get the cash then tonight my oil pump explodes WTF

4267 2018-12-01 22:18:55 Depends on the veterans.

Eisenhower terrorized Iran because of oil and Guatemala because of fruit.  National Security Archive.  Eisenhower was a tyrant outside of USA.

If a foreign leader did to USA what Eisenhower did to Iran & Guatemala, real conservatives would not like it.
4268 2018-12-01 22:18:36 Oh wow I thought he stopped a tyrant from creating a Greater Iraq!  I mean of course the Israelis should not have taken out his nuclear capacity!  We should have let Saddam gobble up Kuwait!  Give him more murdering power and more oil!
4269 2018-12-01 22:18:36 Being a #DesertStorm vet you know the war where the government gave illegal vaccines to troops and let the entire navy sit in the gulf oil for weeks sickening all of us and then denying it for years!

4271 2018-12-01 22:18:25 It’s also an interesting coincidence that the biggest deniers are heavily invested in oil. 
4272 2018-12-01 22:18:20 Maybe US has 800 tons,at least that's why the say. China has huge gold reserves,has been buying & owns the London Exchange 4 precious metals. Russia has oil reserves. Several nations have already dumped the petro $
4273 2018-12-01 22:18:14 11.22.63 shoes Lee Harvey Oswald using 3-In-1. This is bullshit. He’d use real gun oil like the army thought him to.
4274 2018-12-01 22:18:09 Should there be an investigation when Energy East was shut down to what the Liberals insisted was an oversupply of pipeline capacity, if this was based on incompetence, stupidity, or perhaps as a means by Ottawa to get control of Alberta's Oil resources at a discount price?
4275 2018-12-01 22:17:53 imagine what I can do with a 4-wheeler.
4276 2018-12-01 22:17:43 The US alliance with Saudi Arabia goes back much further than Reagan. In the 50s, Standard Oil and Saudi Arabia had a 50/50 profit sharing agreement on oil and we started selling them arms

4279 2018-12-01 22:17:15 Our receivers must've did LeBron's pregame routine with vegetable oil
4280 2018-12-01 22:17:14 Chef Skinner cut up some tinsel, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was chicken, along with hot sauce.
4281 2018-12-01 22:17:13 Be real. No politician is going come out for real action. Their Oil & Gas donors would quit funding them.
4282 2018-12-01 22:17:10 I don't have family wealth, but I know what I hear from women in the oil patch and in construction.

Maybe your wife would like to spend some time doing that, and she can tell you what it's like.

an hour later: *gets in a car crash*
4289 2018-12-01 22:15:04 The government didn’t mandate oil companies to ramp up production before there was transport available to accommodate it. They chose to do so and accepted the risk based on anticipated profits. Those risk were realized. Those same companies can voluntarily curtail production.

4292 2018-12-01 22:14:58 Thank you. I guess you can count me as one of those “miserable asshats” who lived through his shitty administration: his war to ensure his friends in the oil business - including the Saudis - had unfettered access to ME oil, opposition to HIV/AIDS funding & anti-abortion stance.
4293 2018-12-01 22:14:55 Food commercial secrets:

4297 2018-12-01 22:14:22 Looks like maybe Kirby got into the Bama locker room and greased up those Bama receiver gloves with baby oil.

4300 2018-12-01 22:14:05 Lots of people are fucking loyal. Obama is loyal to drones and bankers. Bush was loyal to the Nazi's once and oil execs at a later point. 

Burying people is elitist and a fucking waste. burn me or turn me into soylent for the people. Then they can piss me on to bush's grave.
4301 2018-12-01 22:14:02 Alabama’s decision to dip their gloves in peanut oil for beloved sponsor Chick-fil-A was maybe too aggressive a cash grab

4303 2018-12-01 22:13:40 Honestly I wish someone would take care of my car for free. Like just take her and have her washed, oil changed, tires rotated. That would be nice, thanks
4304 2018-12-01 22:13:31 Did Bama receivers cover their hands in oil before this game.
4305 2018-12-01 22:13:24 Frying with Olive Oil is more dangerous than driving a 44 tonne truck. It always spitting everywhere. I tried to fry topless once using it. Nearly lost my nipples to burns.

4329 2018-12-01 22:10:21 Re: your Bush story.
Bush was a rich man's president who refused to increase taxes on the rich & began an oil war in Iraq to shore up oil supplies for America. Now all sides of politics are paying homage to this rich man's president who did business for his wealthy supporters.
4330 2018-12-01 22:10:19 He can save oil without taking away anyone's rights. People can do more than one thing at a time. No reason to roll back people's rights for no reason.
4331 2018-12-01 22:10:10 Martyn.....it's you !
4332 2018-12-01 22:10:02 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
4333 2018-12-01 22:09:50 I keep hearing Democrats complain about president trump not being hard enough on Russia and Saudi Arabia but they dont mind paying less at the pump for gas. Who exactly do you think made oil cheaper? Saudi Arabia and Russia, when they went against OPEC and flooded the market.
4334 2018-12-01 22:09:34 The oil that is found in poison ivy is called "urushiol."
4335 2018-12-01 22:09:33 Star shortstop for Yale
Youngest Navy pilot
58 combat missions 
Distinguished flying cross
Self-made oil millionaire
Head of the CIA
President of the US
Did not endorse Donald Trump

The last one was the most impressive.

#RIP41
4336 2018-12-01 22:09:29 Just what I thought Giuliani was trying to get done: making Trump out to be a "mere man" instead of a longtime mobster who, together with his entire treason team, sold out the US and the future for Russian oil and LNG + shipping via the melting Arctic.
4337 2018-12-01 22:08:37 theyre gonna be upset when renewable energy trashes oil. Makes you wonder what UK would have to do to trigger a similar loss.  oh...
#peoplesvotenow
4338 2018-12-01 22:08:32 Bomb is life... But try oil. You step out head to toe in a film of glory
4339 2018-12-01 22:08:30 Hello, @Alysssssa440. We are sorry to hear about your long wait for your oil change. Please click the button below to send us a DM with your contact information and the store's address so we can investigate further. ^SB
4340 2018-12-01 22:08:24 Point 2- Next OIL REFINERIES. These use Abserloutely staggering amounts of power, as much as a small town just to convert from into petrol. Far more than is needed to make batteries etc needed for EVs.
4341 2018-12-01 22:08:10 Point 1 - Firstly you have to transport oil both to refineries and then petrol goes in huge deisel trucks have to carry it daily to forecourts. Electrical power goes direct almost instantly from where it is made and into car.
4342 2018-12-01 22:08:01 You also ignore the Billions of dollars that the Sadam regime were taking in through legal oil trade under the Sanctions as well as illegal trade to Syria. So even if there were a rise in mortality, which there wasn't, the blame should be on the dictatorships financial failures.
4343 2018-12-01 22:08:00 Think about it. With 10% of the population of England we are responsible for that amount of the whole UK deficit with oil, whiskey, fishing? Come on man, open your eyes.
4344 2018-12-01 22:08:00 But but but oil...arms....oil. 
11% of our oil and wildly inflated arms profits that they will take these arms and use them against civilians. Hold them to account or nobody will be safe
4345 2018-12-01 22:07:59 Please remember me in ya paradise oo
Me self won change gear oil
4346 2018-12-01 22:07:58 I'm with you man. It drives me crazy when people praise pieces of shit like this because they died. War for oil, death squads in Latin-America, and the crack wave... piece of shit.
4347 2018-12-01 22:07:53 I did indeed. No rendered fat though so I just had to use vegetable oil. Only had a 30 minute rest on the batter too. Probably could have gone longer on that.
4348 2018-12-01 22:07:52 I want to legalize bud in all but a few states make hemp legal and use hemp seed oil and extracts to help study the benefits for our health. As a PHAROAH, my ABSOLUTE authority over the worldly realms will reign SUPREME. As Anubis, god will help me put certain ppl in the grave.
4349 2018-12-01 22:07:50 I’ve got coconut oil and some turmeric powder we could make into a paste
4350 2018-12-01 22:07:31 CBD is the anti psychoactive property of Cannabis, it doesn't produce the high. Just pure cbd oil without any thc gives you anxiety? Damn, try the aroma of black peppercorn.
4351 2018-12-01 22:07:26 Great to chat #conservation, #Snowdonia, crop cultivation, palm oil & @Canada with @markdlutz - very much expecting you @chesterzoo next week so @suewalker2008 can use her massive science head to inspire you!  @walescomiccon #Wrexham
4352 2018-12-01 22:07:13 trump could learn a thing or two on how to handle a journalist from the oil whores
4353 2018-12-01 22:07:09 yes...seems a good egg. Could do with a few more of them.
4354 2018-12-01 22:07:03 Dãããã..... Soja sobe se Trump e Xi acertarem o passo do Tango e a GS vai dizer que acertou....rrsrrssss ....depois do OIL em 01/11 ela tá devendo uma (várias) aos crédulos de boa fé. Para outros que já estavam vendi alta nas CMDTYS é motivo de revisar estudos...RSrsrsrsrs....
4355 2018-12-01 22:06:58 But keep that Saudi oil coming, what a hypocrite
4356 2018-12-01 22:06:57 The argon oil one
4357 2018-12-01 22:06:41 Ukraine sovereignty should be up to the people...not up to any foreigner.  Greedy oil tygoons and foreign military threats may have triggered Russia.
4358 2018-12-01 22:06:36 Blue Dawn dish soap, powder laundry detergent, OR baking soda and a scrub brush and spray off with water hose after applications. After you try that, then try WD-40. Once the top layer and most of the oil comes up, dump Coke/Pepsi on it to get rid of the stain.
4359 2018-12-01 22:06:35 NO, Qatar is rich because they are a small country with HUGE oil deposits.
Babylon was an abomination.
Taxing percentages for overseas businesses is up to the govt. 
Take it up with the ruling party.
4360 2018-12-01 22:06:23 They might name and or oil spill or something like that after him
4361 2018-12-01 22:06:22 I’m getting my oil changed right now and the guy filling up the oil goes, “I think that’s it right?” 

Oh geez.
4362 2018-12-01 22:06:08 Desert Storm was an unmitigated failure. By not doing in 1991 to get Saddam.. GHWB sowed the seeds of Bin Ladin and the corruptly  justified Iraq War. His War Criminal SecDef Dick Cheney cut Americas arteries to bleed American red blood for Cheney's filthy black oil industry

4364 2018-12-01 22:05:59 I think each one trades separately and has their own fan base and story.  The economy is strong in the sense of high shipping volumes.  It’s hard to find drivers like you said.  Makes sense why that transports are high as well as low oil prices should cause the transports to rise
4365 2018-12-01 22:05:38 Former Shell Oil President lambasts Obama for taking credit for the oil production boom and says he was actually a hindrance. 
4366 2018-12-01 22:05:29 Anyone ever use CBD oil?
4367 2018-12-01 22:05:27 Burns 1qt of oil every 500 miles other than that it's a great car. 
4368 2018-12-01 22:05:14 Got permission to get my vacation time paid out early, so now I can finally get an oil change in my car and pick up my meds that I was supposed to start two weeks ago. Hurrayyyyy
4369 2018-12-01 22:05:10 To do nothing in the aftermath but leave a vacuum was immoral in the terms you are using. If we feel that strongly are we going to invade Myanmar to protect the Rohingya people? Oh forget my cynicism there’s no oil there! There are so many other examples of non action.
4370 2018-12-01 22:05:06 It’s @TraderJoe’s Buttermilk pancake mix. I add water and whisk. I make it with olive oil in a nonstick pan instead of butter. Low heat and patience.

4372 2018-12-01 22:04:57 Who gives a shit if it’s “oil money” would you be complaining if your team had oil money. Just having money doesn’t get you shit if you don’t have someone with a plan to spend it
4373 2018-12-01 22:04:51 Read the Standard Oil case. Exactly what Amazon did; lose money to destroy competitors.
4374 2018-12-01 22:04:46 ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. pancakes everywhere have been abused FOR TOO LONG. pancakes everywhere should have the right to maple syrup and NOT motor oil. thank you for coming to my ted talk #pancakerights #notmymaplesyrup #protectthepancakes
4375 2018-12-01 22:04:24 KSA will continue to sell us their oil of course! They won't hurt their economy because they aren't that dumb, unlike other governments.
4376 2018-12-01 22:04:24 900'000 tons of oil? Nothing at all!
4377 2018-12-01 22:04:19 A bit weird but it works. Gaggle with pure coconut oil for 20mins. Sorted.
4378 2018-12-01 22:04:07 Here’s an idea @JustinTrudeau! Contact GM & offer to invest in retooling the auto industry to build electric cars in Canada! And invest in R&D to develop solar powered vehicles! Forget squandering money on obsolete oil transport. Make Canada a truly green world leader! #cdnpoli
4379 2018-12-01 22:04:07 I know what else is a huger problem than Big oil, Big banks, Big Business, do any of these "big companies" have Police? No ....I thought not..
4380 2018-12-01 22:04:03 CBD oil has changed my life
4381 2018-12-01 22:04:00 Lame or not the CIA is clearly fishing for a reason. If they don't get this one they'll find another or just make one up. Wouldn't be the first time. IMO there is a fear China backs RMB with gold (maybe just trade) so US will have to match it with something - oil?
4382 2018-12-01 22:03:46 One word..... Oil!!!
4383 2018-12-01 22:03:43 A pretend war on drugs used as a political move which we're still seeing the horrible ramifications of today.
Ppl think just cause they were in positions of power they should be respected. Get your speeches ready for the presidents of oil drilling companies, if that's the case
4384 2018-12-01 22:03:37 CBD oil is now a causing factor
4385 2018-12-01 22:03:28 Nope.  Electric start.  It hasn’t had an oil change since I bought it last January and I bought it used.
4386 2018-12-01 22:03:05 The UAE’s oil has made it very wealthy. I imagine their drive for nuclear is part of their diversification plan?
4387 2018-12-01 22:03:04 bless being 21 & being able to hit up the dispensaries because i had the time of my lifeee yesterday walked up in that bitch & said “what’s good y’all where’s the flower??” went in there for bud & came out w  bud, oil, & bought all the supplies to dab. let’s fuckkk goooo

4389 2018-12-01 22:02:59 The Soviet Union's oil and gas revenue dropped dramatically, the USSR lost its hold on Eastern Europe. Gorbachev's reforms were slow to bear fruit & did more to hasten the collapse of the Soviet Union than to help, it ceased to exist on December 31, 1991.
4390 2018-12-01 22:02:54 SO MANY OF THE NATIONAL THAT SIGNED "UN Migration Compact" AREN'T TAKING ANY MIGRANTS IN: JAPAN, RUSSIA, CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA, THE REST OF OIL RICH GULF STATES, CUBA, OTHERS. ALL THE MIGRANTS ARE GOING TO EUROPE, CANADA, THE US AND AUSTRALIA. WAKE UP WESTNERS, BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE
4391 2018-12-01 22:02:48 Nothing. I don't care if he brings us back to the oil boom if he also plans to mess with abortion or LGBTQ rights, which is right up the UCP 's alley.
4392 2018-12-01 22:02:46 I'm on a real bad streak that cars only last me the duration of a average time for an oil change. Maybe 2-3 months. Rip charger Rip Subaru
4393 2018-12-01 22:02:42 Two points: 1) shouldn't it say peoplekind rights? 2) Having landlocked our own oil supplies we have zero leverage and need them more than they need us... hollow words are embarrassing better off saying nothing
4394 2018-12-01 22:02:30 I hate the word “influencers”. It makes me want to throw up. It really means snake oil salesman. These people can’t handle real jobs so they just promote shit 24 hours a day. Oh lord I am getting too old to use the internet anymore.
4395 2018-12-01 22:02:28 None, made from palm oil.  Have you seen the palm oil, deforestation and orangutan Issues?  Just saying.
4396 2018-12-01 22:02:16 I think I'll believe the oil executive / Barack Obama any day
4397 2018-12-01 22:02:11 Consume olive oil, cinnamon, dark chocolate, honey and garlic daily. Treasures to African American bodies. *unless allergic*
4398 2018-12-01 22:01:54 Saddam invaded after warning Kuwait about their slant drilling into Iraqi oil fields. (this is what the offensive was going in to stop) The US told Saddam it wasn't going to interfere. The US knew and had planned its own action before Saddam moved one tank.
4399 2018-12-01 22:01:49 Both Alberta & OPEC cuts are likely to be sub 40 ° oil too, further restricting supply of much needed blends.  

#Crude_Quality_Matters
4400 2018-12-01 22:01:31 Google & some oil industry research thinks there may only be 50 years worth of oil reserves left in the ground so probably we will get off carbon in less than 100 years.
4401 2018-12-01 22:01:09 Another phony gop evangelical candidate those bible thumpers are the worst and most are snake oil salesmen.
4402 2018-12-01 22:01:00 wow my dad chnaged my oil AND filled my tank, what a guy
4403 2018-12-01 22:00:57 What utter & complete nonsense 
-Banning abortion won't bring in more oil-  Are you real? Hard to imagine what kind of a mind think up this shit 
WTF does abortion have to do with the oil industry & solutions for it's recovery
4404 2018-12-01 22:00:55 Tastes like motor oil, or so I have been told.
4405 2018-12-01 22:00:32 Beard oil, Brushes, and cologne are all great stocking stuffers 
4406 2018-12-01 22:00:26 Men still do the most terrible jobs possible...coal mines, oil rigs under the sea, so suffer more work related deaths. Patriarchy? If you are tempted to say these are the negative effects of patriarchy on men, I will ask to proffer other systems that create diffnt net outcomes.
4407 2018-12-01 22:00:24 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
4408 2018-12-01 22:00:13 i probably taste like rubber tires and motor oil dont eat me!!!
4409 2018-12-01 22:00:11 December 01, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
4410 2018-12-01 22:00:11 The ADA & immigration reform were good things.  The middle east has had plenty of problems since 1908, if we move to a world without oil they will have plenty more.  You can continue to dwell on the 90s or you can have your glass half full & look to the future.

4412 2018-12-01 22:00:01 slant drilling in 1990? selling oil for euros, not dollars in 2000?
4413 2018-12-01 22:00:00 My dad made me change my tires as soon as I got a car - & how to check the oil & put in gas.  I didnt like it but was glad I knew how when I had a flat tire.
4414 2018-12-01 21:59:57 Oil>cologne
4415 2018-12-01 21:59:57 massage a few tablespoons of castor oil into your scalp and then work it through the rest of your hair. leave it on for 2 hours
combine one ginseng powder capsule to a few tablespoons of coconut oil. massage it into your scalp for 5 minutes 
do either of these a few times a week
4416 2018-12-01 21:59:49 Ahtou. I hate nonsense, i told him to kindly unfollow me cos i dun wanna block him.
4417 2018-12-01 21:59:40 Cbd oil actually works tho.. Well for pain.. Idk about skin care 
4418 2018-12-01 21:59:32 Alaska has oil. Duh.
4419 2018-12-01 21:59:08 Having him dropped down a oil well right now would be very useful for the entire country.
4420 2018-12-01 21:59:04 Those who wonder why @realDonaldTrump won’t address climate change, especially when citizens are pumped full of rage by a country whose only product is oil (Russia), need only watch this video.
4421 2018-12-01 21:59:04 Then you have to EXCLUDE @JoeNeguse. Cause HE TAKES OIL AND GAS MONEY! #BrownsteinHyatt
@BernieSanders. @OurRevolution @Ocasio2018
4422 2018-12-01 21:58:54 But the discounted oil deal to the USA were all negotiated by the Conservative governments. The problem is west Texas crude is at $51 per barrel yet Alberta is getting $17 per barrel. This was not NDP fault it was the Conservative.
4423 2018-12-01 21:58:52 @FirestoneAuto is 8 hours a normal wait time for an oil change?  
Unacceptable. My car has been there since 10:30AM and hasn't even went back yet.
4424 2018-12-01 21:58:46 The hot oil treatment from Lush is AMAZING
4425 2018-12-01 21:58:23 if an eccentric master painter wants to take me as their aprentice and meticulously teach me oil painting so i can become a master painter and national icon thats alright hmu
4426 2018-12-01 21:58:08 Corrupt Government officials who have taken oil money to destroy UK and the Islamic extremists/moles working in public sector God will destroy them all in Jesus name Amen.

4427 2018-12-01 21:57:56 some dude dropped his vape and spilled oil or wax on the floor and now people are eating shit walking into the skybridge
4428 2018-12-01 21:57:49 Collaboration with the palm oil industry? Needs to be phased out & ecosystems restored for carbon sinks & biodiversity. 

Indonesia was the world’s seventh-largest emitter of global warming pollution in 2009, and deforestation accounted for about 30 percent of these emissions.
4429 2018-12-01 21:57:48 Fresh oil decreases friction. The engine runs healthier!

4435 2018-12-01 21:56:49 Do you wax a vaginal ratchet or oil it?
4436 2018-12-01 21:56:48 Will you say the same about Trump?

Why isn't it ok to say what we feel? He was a 1 term president, excused war crimes, destabilized the Mid East in the name of oil, was against women's rights. He sure as shit helped his son(s) steal an election. 

Death doesn't excuse this.
4437 2018-12-01 21:56:41 Squeaky wheel gets the oil

4444 2018-12-01 21:56:26 Sure! The actual recipe calls for making your own short pastry and folding the edges over the filling, but I just used an 8-inch whole-wheat crust from the co-op. That said, you cut three medium onions into thick slices. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet.

4447 2018-12-01 21:56:07 @LushMiddleEast are you against Middle East oil as well as Canadian?
4448 2018-12-01 21:55:30 Didn't they just find a bunch of oil over there.  Highly doubt that land will he returned.
4449 2018-12-01 21:55:29 It was Harper who didn't want to get Alberta oil to market. He spent 9 years bloviating but accomplished diddly squat when it came to building a pipeline to the West Coast ensuring the long-term viability of Alberta's oil. Harper’s epic failure will haunt Alberta for a generation
4450 2018-12-01 21:55:23 Doesn’t seem angry or envious. He’s stating a fact. Any time oil goes over $50/barrel it becomes economically feasible to frack. When that happens America becomes the top producer. It’s a key reason OPEC tries to keep production up, so the price goes down and the US doesn’t prod.
4451 2018-12-01 21:55:11 Get ammo,guns, TV, oil change, cereal, food and gas all in one stop
4452 2018-12-01 21:55:10 23 % c est donc l homme politique le plus apprécier des français .. a par hulot. qui n est pas franchement pour la defence du gaz oil
4453 2018-12-01 21:55:09 I personally prefer to vape it because taking the oil orally makes me feel sick.  I'm not sure why it happens, but it's the same when I try and do olive/coconut oil shots 
4454 2018-12-01 21:55:02 Then drop him down an oil well and in a hundred thousand years he may be some use!
4455 2018-12-01 21:54:56 Yeah deffo! They dip tampons in water and microwave them to make things look like they're hot with steam coming out of them, put oil over meat to make them look juicy and prep things up on burgers with tooth pics and all that xxx
4456 2018-12-01 21:54:21 This is step one... step 2 will be the ditching of the USD as payment for oil. After that it is only a matter of time for a large correction in the value of the USD.

4460 2018-12-01 21:53:37 How much oil? Heated or not?
4461 2018-12-01 21:53:34 First I'd feel on it & kiss & caress it for hours; then put oil on my face cheeks & rub it from there onto her butt cheeks; next put my face deep inside her ass crack for a long time; I'd eat it for a long time & then, of course, I'd fuck it for as long as possible over and over.
4462 2018-12-01 21:53:32 Anybody else enjoy Sair  covered in oil

4463 2018-12-01 21:53:28 And not coincidentally, the Kochs or Mercers or both (I've forgotten) would also clean up on Arctic oil...oh, and Tortoise McConnell's in-laws are in the shipping biz...
4464 2018-12-01 21:53:20 Global Warming, Iran will have to shut down its oil industry. It sounds funny when you tell other countries to follow UN initiatives.
4465 2018-12-01 21:53:09 Imagine the muckrakers being like “Standard Oil is trying to form a monopoly and it’s the worst thing ever and I must spread the word, but it’s actually not going to work because other oil execs said they will not be bought.”
4466 2018-12-01 21:53:07 It's very concerning but with a population of 80M+ and control of the Strait of Hormuz through which all the oil must flow, Iran's a whole other level of conflict as compared to Iraq, Syria, or Afghanistan.
4467 2018-12-01 21:53:05 How is it possible that after all the good times there's nothing to show for it, that's shitting the bed. And listen, if you think the Liberals are suddenly at fault for not diversifying where AB sold it's oil then you're either woefully misinformed or willfully ignorant.
4468 2018-12-01 21:53:02 oil? isolation? ¥€$?
4469 2018-12-01 21:52:45 I think it’s more the mining of lithium and cobalt that he’s is referring too suggesting EV’s are a hypocrisy. I’m just intrigued how it compares to drilling etc for oil and all that goes with that, up to the shipping, both on the seas down to the pumps on our forecourts.#sarcasm

4471 2018-12-01 21:52:27 Buy a box mix. Substitute melted butter for oil. Throw in some extra chocolate chunks/chips and some dried cherries. Bake it 25 degrees lower and for longer.

4474 2018-12-01 21:52:14 Too bad Trump is uncaring...I'm convinced that toxic algal blooms in FL are related to BP oil spill years ago. Now that Gulf is ruined...lets go for the Atlantic. Must get these people out of power.
4475 2018-12-01 21:52:13 Will say, the keyboard on the Surface Laptop 2 (the keys, not the fabric) seems to show any sign of oil real easily. Didn't think I was that messy but now I wonder.
4476 2018-12-01 21:52:07 Seems to me the whole country was depending and benefitting from the Oil royalties, and its substantial contributions to the “Canadian” infrastructure. This current Oil downturn will be enormous in months ahead. Libs aren’t smart enough to see it tho...
4477 2018-12-01 21:52:01 What are oil prices at Bobby  boy....
4478 2018-12-01 21:51:59 Drops like baby oil on the gloves
4479 2018-12-01 21:51:45 This is Sally from Mesa, Az. I hope to get in but I'm at AutoZone having them come my battery and buying oil #nchat
4480 2018-12-01 21:51:44 DID SOMEONE PUT OIL ON OUR PLAYERS’ GLOVES OR SOMETHING
4481 2018-12-01 21:51:40 Donald trump has let people get murdered for oil, has shady dealings with the Russians. . is morally bankrupt. . so come again. He also beat & raped his first wife.
4482 2018-12-01 21:51:35 Don't for God's sake let your minions find out that that oil was never meant to be refined or used in Canada. That 
would spoil your narrative. Hahaha
4483 2018-12-01 21:51:27 He has money in oil. All his moves against the environment are for money.
4484 2018-12-01 21:51:26 IMO this is exactly  why CIA keeps pushing MbS angle. US searching for any reason at all to start Saudi regime change. Forget about "allies" belief. US needs to dominate oil trade DIRECTLY rather than through proxy
4485 2018-12-01 21:51:13 The Trump administration has authorized five companies to "incidentally, but not intentionally, harass marine mammals" by using seismic air guns to search for oil and gas in the Atlantic Ocean. Worlds biggest douche koozie.
4486 2018-12-01 21:51:04 I'm sorry, but I don't take you seriously after concern trolling about rural Ontario and oil & gas when really you're just pimping nuclear which is grotesquely expensive, has a major problem with waste, and if you're going to talk about emissions and nuclear talk about concrete.
4487 2018-12-01 21:51:02 Of course #Putin & other oil producers would want to stifle America’s production of fossil fuels. It would only help them drive up costs
4488 2018-12-01 21:51:00 Reality is Carbon Taxes themselves do ZERO to reduce carbon emissions, only direct legislation banning use of Oil, Coal+Gas does that! The real agenda here is the GRADUAL DE-Industrialization of Western Nations to move banking and industry to China-you Globalist's 'Ideal' nation!
4489 2018-12-01 21:50:53 Trust me, bit of oil on em and they’re good to go
4490 2018-12-01 21:50:52 Same and got my oil changed and it has never been easier
4491 2018-12-01 21:50:48 Have you seen the mess in Paris? Never mind MbS on Khashoggi. But I asked Uganda what their fuel cost is. They are paying CAD $1.66. I am paying $1.05 in Moncton area. Oil is not making sense.
4492 2018-12-01 21:50:47 But pumping/fracking for oil is better? EV's will offset it's environmental imprint over time. A fossil fuel powered car will always increase its footprint. What is your argument.
4493 2018-12-01 21:50:43 I say oil hits $65 in 2019
4494 2018-12-01 21:50:20 The coordinator for Akassa axis oil & gas Engr Sunday Opinion attended dual functions at Egweama and Liama on friday.
4495 2018-12-01 21:50:05 Albertans can survive for sure, which is what we've been doing the past few years. You want to complain about oil being devalued, thank the idiots that thought just selling to the US for decades was a great idea.
4496 2018-12-01 21:50:02 I wet my hair first with hot water or aloe Vera juice then put my leave on which I use the Shea Moisture Jamaican black castor oil one or just make my own and seal with my oil mix and I just re-wet it every so often until it’s time to wash again
4497 2018-12-01 21:49:59 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
4498 2018-12-01 21:49:57 George H W Bush was a mass murderer, just like his son, George W Bush Jr. Both invaded the same country and killed millions of people for oil.
4499 2018-12-01 21:49:50 @Samir_Madani if there were no sanctions, how much oil do you think #Iran could export?
4500 2018-12-01 21:49:48 PTP - Motor oil, not for breakfast anymore! #protectthepancake
4501 2018-12-01 21:49:43 Calgary need tech diversity. Unfortunetly we lost our competitve edge for oil & gas. Nice video
4502 2018-12-01 21:49:30 The war on terror was a guise to take over the middle easts oil wealth #StayWoke
4503 2018-12-01 21:49:30 No one said any of that , take you & yo coconut oil on
4504 2018-12-01 21:49:27 There is zero chance of eliminating carbon based economy in the next 100 years but a pipeline would ensure the least carbon impact delivering the oil for those 100 years
4505 2018-12-01 21:49:25 They fry in the same oil as the chicken 
4506 2018-12-01 21:49:12 Be ready for confusing macro data the coming six months. Some will show expansion,others contraction. Some correlations will break down or inverse. Wages and inflation are likely to keep rising,while oil prices and ISM numbers fall. Think carefully about which are leading/lagging
4507 2018-12-01 21:49:11 We must drill our own oil and stop relying on global interests that hate America and our traditional values
4508 2018-12-01 21:49:07 みんながそうやって炒められて揚げられて…ねぇ、誰のおかげ?誰のおかげかな?

4510 2018-12-01 21:48:57 As a matter of fact, his administration was an impediment to oil development. “Narcissistic fool!”
4511 2018-12-01 21:48:45 This girl keeps smelling her essential oil and I keep thinking she's hitting her poppers on my sales floor 
4512 2018-12-01 21:48:37 Never heard of him.

And that's not surprising...apparently you have to racist science-denying xenophobic jerk that hawks snake oil supplements, reverse mortgages, and prepper food buckets to be popular on the right.
4513 2018-12-01 21:48:36 جزاك الله خير وكتب الله اجرك ووسع لك في رزقك
4514 2018-12-01 21:48:34 This where I am confused. Heftar declared a coup on tv. Fajr attacked and destroyed the airport, set oil terminals on fire, refused to recognize an elected govt, and essentially executed a coup, yet you focus on Heftar. He is not part of the equation of what happened to Tripoli.
4515 2018-12-01 21:48:29 Where do you think all these British American sports team owners got their money?straight from slavery!
That's worse than Oil money
4516 2018-12-01 21:48:25 Just resources?   America has oil ...it has everything...
4517 2018-12-01 21:48:18 Work with the @GOP ? They have been infiltrated for at least 3 decades by Russia. Have carefully chosen representatives/ senators who are thugs owing their ascent to the @NRA , the Koch brothers, the Mercers, oil rich countries etc. @GOP = mobsters.  Sorry, I’ll pass.

4525 2018-12-01 21:47:15 Captain of the Yale baseball team, played in the first 2 college World Series, was a Navy torpedo fighter pilot in WWII, founded a very successful oil company, head of the CIA, VP of the U.S. for 8 years, one-term POTUS, married to the same woman for 73 years.

4528 2018-12-01 21:46:48 Tried explaining what THC oil is to mom dukes she looked at me like I was a brack head
4529 2018-12-01 21:46:48 producing millions of barrels of oil, at a huge carbon footprint and massive environmental damage and selling it for pennies on the dollar due to lack of pipelines. We are getting all of the downsides to oil production and none of the befits. Sound pretty bad to me.
4530 2018-12-01 21:46:47 Seems Teugroper is doing very well himself at creating division in the country. Just gave his Quebec buddies a quiet extension on Equalization formula so they could get another $11.7 B in transfers, largely from AB’s dwindling Oil royalties.
4531 2018-12-01 21:46:45 Nobody wants no borders.  Unions do most of the work on oil sands so NDP cant be against them, who wants to end free speech? Etc. Etc. Provincial NDP have nothing to do with military, anything else? NDP is about as similar to liberal party as PC is.
4532 2018-12-01 21:46:42 The Argan oil one is better in my opinion
4533 2018-12-01 21:46:39 Wait, I hope you did not use the pepper and oil for your lunch. Kappa 
4534 2018-12-01 21:46:28 Which the rest of us already know.  The only person on the planet who thinks @BarackObama deserves any credit for the oil boom is himself - and as deluded as he is about so much, he really should see a psychiatrist.
4535 2018-12-01 21:46:16 You all need to make up your mind. Trump doesn't condone it. Saudi threatens to cut oil and you all cry about gas prices and that Trump should mind his own business.  Trump says oh well forget about it and now you all are mad.   SMH.   you all make me sick. Make up your minds.

4543 2018-12-01 21:44:59 They are theoretical courses and gives the lecturers the flexibility to determine the level of acceptance of responses to exam questions. Questions along the lines of discuss, explain, highlight, enumerate etc mean different things to different people. In calculations its one way
4544 2018-12-01 21:44:58 Whilst they are still getting a huge dividend they will stay. only way to get them out is if revenue dries up and that's not happening soon.If they do sell who can buy?

4547 2018-12-01 21:44:43 Well Rollo is looking his age, but Lagertha seems to have found the Oil of Olay (even with the white wig).

I rather like Bjearn tho, he's very much his father's son.

but I have to admit a bit of a fancy for Ivar the Boneless.

VERY Charismatic.
4548 2018-12-01 21:44:34 Tap!!!! I go discharge ooo
4549 2018-12-01 21:44:06 So I understand supply and demand.. and its effect on pricing.   Can someone explain how when it comes to oil more supply apparently means higher price, contrary  to every other market?
4550 2018-12-01 21:43:58 The way Man Utd are going down, they will soon discover oil.
4551 2018-12-01 21:43:54 @Stuart__Bingham from 4-0 to 5-4 you are a match-fixer. Useless player.
4552 2018-12-01 21:43:50 Is that an actual question? Shitting the bed during EVERY oil boom? Ignoring the Heritage Fund that should be enormous? Not diversifying? Willingly selling almost ALL of the oil to one customer for decades? Just inept and stupid decisions for eons lead to this reality.
4553 2018-12-01 21:43:47 We should stop referring to Dr. Oz as a doctor. Instead, we should start calling him Mehmet The Snake Oil Salesman.
4554 2018-12-01 21:43:46 They understood in mid 60s that the system doesn't work and started decentralizing, but unfortunately Siberian oil was found and reforms were stopped.

4564 2018-12-01 21:42:27 Romantic words from @johncaubble yesterday when I came in from flying. He gave me a hug & said, “You smell like a 172.” Yeah, that would be avgas, oil and a little sweat. 
4565 2018-12-01 21:42:19 They are raising taxes on oil and a tiny part of that tax will go into sustainable energy.
4566 2018-12-01 21:42:00 Former president Obama should take a lesson on how to be a humble former president from former president bush because he is just acting like fool trying to take credit for the economy and American oil production enough already what ever your legacy was is just being diminished.
4567 2018-12-01 21:41:58 It’s the lazy way to cookie!! Box of cake mix, 1/2 cup oil, 2 eggs, any add-ins (choc chips or mallow bits or fruit, maybe some peanut butter or cream cheese), bake at 350 for 11 minutes. It’s lazy AF and the cookies don’t look impressive but they taste good!
4568 2018-12-01 21:41:54 When the west pays equalization yet our oil is refused in the East! You know that the country is not a national effort but an elitist rouge a Shell game rigged for the west to fail everytime!

4571 2018-12-01 21:41:30 it’s about money and oil so yeah lol
4572 2018-12-01 21:41:01 For me, the final half verse of 
"For it is you Lord only who make me dwell in safety" is especially comforting,  but...
I can't pass up "more than when grain, and wine, and oil increase." It's so earthy and concrete. Shows how we find God in our very lives.
4573 2018-12-01 21:40:52 I had to learn to change my own oil & tire before I could take my drivers test.
4574 2018-12-01 21:40:49 Everyone is safer by a mile and we stop selling our oil at a huge carbon footprint for pennies on the dollar.
4575 2018-12-01 21:40:44 @BullofJohn he needs your beard oil oh
4576 2018-12-01 21:40:44 OMG YES! That’s what I said and LITERALLY everyone close to me that I called said gas or fire  I have no idea where I learned peanut oil from though if none of them say it 
4577 2018-12-01 21:40:38 It's all about making money on coal, oil, gas...fuck the planet
4578 2018-12-01 21:40:32 In the US, we are giving the oil companies subsidies!!! RIDICULOUS!! We subsidize the rich, and tax the hell out of the poor. Then, to really stick it to to the little guy, we're on our own for health coverage, educatuon, retirement, etc... #criminal

4581 2018-12-01 21:40:17 Oil lamps and candles
4582 2018-12-01 21:40:15 Yah it’s called criminal background checks required for everyone working on a government approved projects, increased RCMP budget for officers follow traveling projects.... and keep building the pipeline so that we stop loosing billions in oil revenue.
4583 2018-12-01 21:40:13 They might have the 4th biggest oil reserves found in 2015. That’s why the dems came up with the collusion with Russia trying 2 cripple them. Obama put sanctions and all it’s doing is making them more sufficiently Independent. She’ll found the oil!! American company
4584 2018-12-01 21:40:08 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
4585 2018-12-01 21:40:03 How many oil booms need to be frittered away before folks understand something has been very wrong for a very long time? If Albertans think they "need support from their country" they should stop looking down their noses when times are good then pointing fingers when they're not.
4586 2018-12-01 21:39:58 "0.5%" is just a number without proof. You ignore too the oil tankers required to move oil after it's been transported - spills are common news. NO MORE OIL!
4587 2018-12-01 21:39:56 We use ours all the time, its great and more healthy than using oil, we cook all sorts in it from Sausages to breaded fish.
4588 2018-12-01 21:39:51 Oil & Coffee
4589 2018-12-01 21:39:31 The claim of the original dispute was over Kuwait's "slant-drilling" into oil supplies underneath Iraq within their borders. Saddam stupidly thought that occupying all of Kuwait was a possible response. Absolutely moronic. To me this was the Glaspie misinterpretation by Saddam.
4590 2018-12-01 21:39:27 I like the #UCP concern about jobs. IMO, #pipelines are not the only approach. Why not advocate and promote the refining of oil in Alberta, instead of letting the jobs and value added money go to the United States? #ableg

4598 2018-12-01 21:38:50 Oil in frying pan, dont do it too long just enough to give it a nice crust....its gotta be a block and not crumbled goat cheese
4599 2018-12-01 21:38:46 Exxon and Mobil, a goddamn oil company, came up with the same results
4600 2018-12-01 21:38:46 The West are hardly angels themselves, look at the middle east and the war crimes committed by USA, UK, Saudi Arabia and their allies over the control of oil.
4601 2018-12-01 21:38:42 1. In a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat, add olive oil and butter, potatoes, garlic, thyme, rosemary and oregano. Cook for about 3 minutes, stir and cook and additional 3 minutes or until fork tender. Remove and set on a plate.
4602 2018-12-01 21:38:39 there have been cases where cbd oil showed crazy improvements with similar conditions
4603 2018-12-01 21:38:39 What would motivate a die hard libertarian free market capitalist to abandon his moral compass. He wouldn’t possibly be invested in some of the non-divested oil corps? Would he?
4604 2018-12-01 21:38:35 yes yes yes. A cold pan and oil on high heat does the job as well
4605 2018-12-01 21:38:27 Absolutely is. I believe that we both agree that we HAVE TO get our products to other buyers.

Any time any world market uses Alberta oil, they’re supporting ethical production, worker rights, labour standards, human rights, enviro responsibility, regulatory accountability...
4606 2018-12-01 21:38:18 it’s one of my faves next to the flaxseed/castor oil one. gives a nice shine!
4607 2018-12-01 21:38:13 Best presidential resume since George Washington: Decorated Navy pilot, successful oil executive, congressman, United Nations delegate, GOP chairman, envoy to Beijing, CIA director, and 8-yr. Vice President. RIP George H W Bush.
4608 2018-12-01 21:38:11 Why didn’t they ask her if they suspected and were afraid the gun would be used on them if they were broken into or the gun would go off accidentally? The gun was legal and it is within her rights. They did not have the right to go through her personal belongings. End of story

4610 2018-12-01 21:37:58 I don't think there is disdain for the people of the east but rather a lack of insight into energy independence.  We would be an even greater country free from Saudi oil.  Well maybe disdain for Trudeau snobby Quebec attitude...

4614 2018-12-01 21:37:16 No, it just amuses me. Does justifying the systematic murder of human beings in a war that was intended only to increase American oil profits (success) and Bush’s own flagging popularity (failure) get you a higher rank than “internet douchebro”?
4615 2018-12-01 21:37:02 A fascist tyrant warmonger wanted to control oil prices by invading a neighbour and grabbing a virtual monopoly. Sounds very much like the sort of guy some anti imperialists need to support to prove their inherent insanity.

4618 2018-12-01 21:36:45 My recipe. Chop hardboiled eggs, gherkin, spring onions and mix with olive oil, lemon, mustard & salt until it’s a thick relish type thickness. Add to boiled new potatoes. I promise it is awesome
4619 2018-12-01 21:36:26 At -40C, we definitely have problems now and then with all ICE-cars, the electric engine is superior in cold climate. Period. (has no oil). How Tesla manage to have their batteris working in the cold I simply don't know.
4620 2018-12-01 21:36:22 Trudeau destruction of the economy can not be understated, imagine the cost in jobs of Northern Gateway, Energy East, and Trans Mountain. Add shutting down Alberta oil industry. 250,000 plus jobs lost under Trudeau policy inaction.  @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley @jkenney

4629 2018-12-01 21:35:43 They're selling you scented snake oil, so they have to try harder.
4630 2018-12-01 21:35:42 We tried but they were privatised anyway. Like British Gas (sold to the French) Electricity (sold to the Spanish) North sea oil, buses, trains, DWP..............
4631 2018-12-01 21:35:31 I’m old enough to remember the media slandering Bush; the no blood for oil nonsense from the Left; and now they all love him and his dumb seed because NOT TRUMP.
4632 2018-12-01 21:35:19 I believe in science, yes.
It would appear you believe in conspiracies. Maybe ask yourself why oil industry funded studies are lying to you.

4646 2018-12-01 21:33:35 you entire thesis is based off the assumption that I and others *only* criticize Musk and not oil companies and govt officials, which is false

If you find yourself believing you're the only rational person in a debate where everyone is "too emotional", you are likely mistaken.

4655 2018-12-01 21:32:25 The USA is the primary reason for all of those countries being hooked on oil and conflict.

also china is planting trees like crazy and makes diamonds out of the Carbon in the air to help fight climate disaster. also has the longest electric vehicle supported road in the world.
4656 2018-12-01 21:32:24 Shame you don’t use sustainable palm oil though. I’m completely gutted.

4658 2018-12-01 21:31:55 Tomorrow’s headlines, today: “Conservatives applaud NDP for taking their advice to reduce oil production. Alberta Party applauds Conservatives for stealing the idea from them first.” #ableg
4659 2018-12-01 21:31:52 Lol, people losing their jobs, the east importing oil from Saudi, the US shipping tankers down the west coast and Alberta not getting any support from their own country.  But we are just a bunch of whiners?  Whatever you say...

4661 2018-12-01 21:31:51 Well Obama blocked every pipeline for carrying oil that came along, he added tons of Regulations & tried his hardest to slow production via his pen. But he had No Say over State Owned or Privately Owned property where Oil Wells & Refineries were built.

Obama also required all Vehicles to have higher fuel standards
As new vehicles get better mileage they use less gas thus less oil and that increases supply and prices drop

4670 2018-12-01 21:31:28 Did you see the clip of Obama from last week where he was telling a room full of billionaires that they should be thanking him for making the US the largest oil producing nation? We're a few steps past gross.
4671 2018-12-01 21:31:28 Different techniques to increase the oil recovery have to be pursued, and one of them is altering the wettability of porous reservoir rock surfaces to more water wet by letting the value of contact angle (θ) less or equal 90

4675 2018-12-01 21:31:12 I wish he had helped make those words a reality. But a US based oil company was in fact side-drilling into the Iraqi oil fields. And his State Dept person was vague with Saddam about any aggressive action to disrupt this practice. I wonder what the world would look like.
4676 2018-12-01 21:31:12 I met a white woman named Sarah with two kids (8 and 5) in the backseat who came in for an oil change and she had on a sweatshirt that said “Gangsta rap made me do it”
4677 2018-12-01 21:31:04 Tonight after @hockeynightinsd on @CityNewsYEG and @BTCityNewsCGY at 11pm we dive into Alberta's oil crisis. What could lowering production mean? What would letting the market sort itself out look like? 
Premier Notley is set to make an announcement tomorrow. #YEG #YYC

4681 2018-12-01 21:30:45 @RachelNotley  Alberta already lost 225k B/D of oil production. how much more are you thinking we should cut? Is this cut even going to matter over the long-term?
4682 2018-12-01 21:30:44 Great, in addition to turning back all of the environmental progress we’ve made over the years, now Trump is going to be “harassing“ marine life including whales, sea turtles and dolphin just to look for oil in the Atlantic. The sea life better swim for its lives.
4683 2018-12-01 21:30:27 I'm sure he was a patriot, but 386 Coalition Force members died in the 1st Iraq war...this is the legacy of George H.W. Bush. I'd wager all of these casualties wanted to live at least 94 years. HINT: It was all about the oil, not the people of Kuwait. #GeorgeHWBush

4716 2018-12-01 21:26:33 Why so high? The price per barrel of oil is in the basement.
4717 2018-12-01 21:26:31 I have been thinking about the GM plant closing in Ontario, I think #dougford should build an oil refinery in Ontario. More jobs for Ontario, possibly a balanced budget. Ships leaving Canada with oil is better then ships arriving with oil. That is want I want for Christmas.
4718 2018-12-01 21:26:27 Well, it’s hard to be SUPER high-T when there’s a robot working on it. They don’t understand testosterone. They think it’s like some special form of oil.

4732 2018-12-01 21:24:24 I’d hate to see anyone burned in oil.
4733 2018-12-01 21:24:21 Once place you’ll never catch an NDP member.  Talking to an unemployed oil field worker.
4734 2018-12-01 21:24:18 brilliant, gyalkapone was doing some samples for cbd oil recently so def check her
4735 2018-12-01 21:24:15 Sesame oil is good also
4736 2018-12-01 21:24:08 I'm sure there is an essential oil for that toxicity.
4737 2018-12-01 21:24:06 Separation?  Good luck with that.  If you separate, how do you propose moving your oil through BC and East?
4738 2018-12-01 21:24:06 If you have 4 hair try deep conditioning with African Best Hair Mayonnaise first and the apply those products for defining your curls !! Don’t forget to add a lil oil to seal the moisture 
4739 2018-12-01 21:23:55 I personally prefer stir fry in low sodium soy sauce and avocado oil
4740 2018-12-01 21:23:53 In addition to other products, I just started using grapeseed oil on my hair. I think I like it. dmp

4743 2018-12-01 21:23:41 So I tried to start it after filling it with gas and so far no go.  Gave up and will try again tomorrow.  My own fault for not getting it in for maintenance/oil change.

4746 2018-12-01 21:23:25 Dear NYT,
Take a long look at Vermont's management. There are a few people there who don't want a 19th century life style. Unfortunately they have to take their case to VT's supreme court to heat with natural gas (vs wood) and use electric lights (vs whale oil).
4747 2018-12-01 21:23:20 No they are tricky for me as well. I’m going to do it 100% how I would normally apply foundation too. I bought the oil for a base and the setting powder. We gonna have a full ass review.
4748 2018-12-01 21:23:10 Omg okay so never coming to Walmart for an oil change again in my life.
4749 2018-12-01 21:23:09 原材料にpine oilとあったので、いや、君はモミの木じゃないのかと突っ込んでおきました。（検索したところによると、松脂というよりテレピン油寄りらしいです…油彩で使ってたあの香りだとすると、とても食欲は沸きませんね；）
4750 2018-12-01 21:23:04 Grendel P-10, Cal .380, before and after pictures. Work performed, deep clean and rust removal. Deep clean includes a complete disasembly of firearm, stripping off all of the old oil and debris, new rust preventative oil applied and reassembly.
4751 2018-12-01 21:22:55 @JustinTrudeau  And yet Canada will still continue to buy Saudi oil from murderers instead of  building a pipeline using Canadian oil. It apparently has something to do with the fact that Canadian construction  men are rapist.
4752 2018-12-01 21:22:54 I wish I could eat there ;-; fucc peanut oil

4754 2018-12-01 21:22:51 It about time. We've been aware of the real cost of burning oil for decades but haven't had the fortitude to do anything about it. I hope the rest of world quickly follows Denmark's example...
4755 2018-12-01 21:22:47 羨ましい
4756 2018-12-01 21:22:41 il faut récupérer l'or pour acheter du gas oil !!! 
lol
4757 2018-12-01 21:22:31 Price per barrel is at its lowest though. Expect big earning by big oil companies off American workers backs
4758 2018-12-01 21:22:25 And a ruthless war monger, who orchestrated a invasion of Iraq, which killed millions of innocent people, over oil.
4759 2018-12-01 21:22:11 Peanut oil
4760 2018-12-01 21:22:08 Ok now I understand what you are saying, but you should also know they're two different things, even though ATBU decided to leave it under mech, but I know as time goes on they'll expand.
4761 2018-12-01 21:22:02 Might start putting coconut oil in my eyes to get better vision

4763 2018-12-01 21:21:50 Paid $44 for 4qts of oil by autozone while Walmart have 5qts for $26 
4764 2018-12-01 21:21:48 not to mention #oil=#war
4765 2018-12-01 21:21:40 Scrolling the perverted side of twitter as I wait for my car to get oil change. Remember when we were stuck reading their shitty magazines .
4766 2018-12-01 21:21:35 Are you kidding? They and their forefathers have been financing and arming wars on both sides for generations. They've made $billions on gov armament/oil contracts for wars they started. Parasites. Much of the US $20trillion debt has gone to them. I'd like to see their tax bill.
4767 2018-12-01 21:21:31 Imagine your girl asked you to oil her scalp and braid it down for a wig. She has no edges so you’re still on braid 1 because the 3 little pieces keep slipping out your hand. Yall have to leave thr house in 1hr 
4768 2018-12-01 21:21:21 Ahh I'll have to look! Just something I noticed.

Otherwise no oil or filter changes, no spark plugs, cooling system but less chance of it needing replacing, automatic :D
4769 2018-12-01 21:21:19 Roommate thought cooking was:
1. Heat oil in pan on highest gas burner setting.
2. Oil is hot when you can smell it two floors up.
3. Throw frozen thing in oil.

Didn't understand how they caught the kitchen on fire.

4772 2018-12-01 21:21:05 That's a load of BS, Trump lobs a couple Tomahawks in2 Syria, the press went Wild that he's starting WW3, Bush Invades a sovereign nation because they threatened Israel and wanted Iraqs oil and the Press didn't say a damn thing !!!!
4773 2018-12-01 21:20:45 In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Make a well in the center, and pour in milk, egg and oil. Mix until smooth.

Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat.

4775 2018-12-01 21:20:25 Seismic blasting is a really bad thing. It can kill or damage thousands of dolphin and other sea life. It can ruin the commercial fish industry. Oil and gas drilling off the coast will spoil tourism industries up and down the coast. No Atlantic coast government wants it. No to SB
4776 2018-12-01 21:20:25 USA #1 in oil production right now
4777 2018-12-01 21:20:09 I rebuilt the suspension, fixed all the terrible bodywork and it burned more oil than petrol but I loved that car.
4778 2018-12-01 21:19:58 Diesel is more efficient but unfortunately it is an oil and not volatile. 
Incomplete combustion produces particles which are impossible to remove despite DPF filters etc. 
The industry sells cars and keeps pushing them onto public without regard for collective health. Greed.
4779 2018-12-01 21:19:53 Humm is it sad that George Bush #41 President passed away?
Did he not and his family have ties to Bin Laden family with oil dealings?
Privileged rich people, he also raised taxes, like Trump in a different way, Trump gave the rich a forever tax break as the poor pay pay pay!
BSBS
4780 2018-12-01 21:19:51 Retrain Hundreds of thousands to do what? Will those industries pay royalties to the government for a portion of their production? How will we support AG and forestry which are highly depending on Fossil Fuels for there operations? You would prefer Saudi blood oil to Alberta Oil?
4781 2018-12-01 21:19:46 Lol, Not me driving..
But timing belt was apparently done.
Spark plugs planning to do soon.

Filter and oil is first on the list.

Exhaust seems fine.

Coolant seems fine from first looks.

Automatic.
4782 2018-12-01 21:19:23 I would love  to receive the high potency CBD oil as a gift to help me with my spinal fusion pain.

4784 2018-12-01 21:19:19 @QueensOfJannah1  made the chappatis. Thank you for the recipe. I know what I was doing wrong. I was not putting enough oil before and I also was rolling them too thin. My girls loved making them 
4785 2018-12-01 21:19:17 Production cuts for every Alberta oil producer?  Cut versus what base line, who enforces these cuts and what are the penalties for non-compliance? Unfortunately way too complicated to work. #Alberta #oil
4786 2018-12-01 21:19:12 Here we go. Tonight’s game is all that matters. Can’t wait to watch the @S1LVERBULLETS #LetItFly in Lucas Oil. We can only control & worry about us. #GoBucks!

#Isa53:5 Amen
4790 2018-12-01 21:18:47 They all are, it's called snake oil 

This is what high-functioning psychopaths do, aka con-men.
4791 2018-12-01 21:18:42 We don’t need a uranium reactor. Even during 'normal operation' - radiation is released and radioactive waste is produced; for which there is no solution. It’s bad enough that we are on the hook to clean up all the old shut in oil wells that oil companies have walked away from.

4795 2018-12-01 21:18:04 Moroccan oil products. Give all of them to me.
4796 2018-12-01 21:17:58 It was none of our business. We shouldn't have been over there in the first place. He was just protecting the oil for him and his cronies. He's responsible for everything that's going on in the middle East today.
4797 2018-12-01 21:17:52 Try using Jamaican black Castro oil. It really helped my hair growth when my hair broke off.

4802 2018-12-01 21:17:18 Fish oil wasted on the ramparts. Slime down the abbey.
4803 2018-12-01 21:17:02 HA!!!!! My skin loves that oil.
4804 2018-12-01 21:16:51 Change is good and if its done in moderation over time. Slowly moving away from fossil fuels. But the world will never become non reliant on oil to much of our life products rely on it
4805 2018-12-01 21:16:40 Will be glad when they run out of oil and we can dump them back in the deserts to wonder about aimlessly like they have done for hundreds of years before.
4806 2018-12-01 21:16:35 Peppermint oil take care of alludat
4807 2018-12-01 21:16:04 Happy to see you make this post Yusuf. We appreciate the work y'all do in Lagos, but it is so unfortunate that majority of you carry out their duties on a daily in the best unprofessional manner. When the oil stains one finger it touches the others. We wish others can be like you

4809 2018-12-01 21:15:33 @Deadlyslob found your beard oil in game for the first time. I was very excited. Sold it immediately but the sentiment was there.
4810 2018-12-01 21:15:30 Unlikely, but somebody pointed out that Russia's Rosneft & Gazprom could be good models for say, Nigeria's national oil & gas company and Russian wheat & arms exports are increasingly important.
4811 2018-12-01 21:15:25

4813 2018-12-01 21:14:58 I've ordered and tried Good Vibes.  My question is do you have any knowledge of the benefits of using CBD oil to help multiple Sclerosis symptoms. My son was diagnosed this summer
4814 2018-12-01 21:14:58 Glad for Mark Sisson's just rewards, but fear for the future of his products. Thankfully, he's inspired others to DIY at home and even new product lines. (Good avo oil and mayo at Costco, wouldn't have happened without him.)

4817 2018-12-01 21:14:53 I buy my mom CBD oil when I can and that's the mindset I have about it. She has a severely degenerated spine and the oil totally nullifies her pain. My cousin also uses the oil for seizure control from her brain tumor. Magic stuff. Hope you open in more states in the south.
4818 2018-12-01 21:14:49 I need peppermint oil for my own peppermint hot chocolate.

Baco Exu do Blues é um rapper BAIANO que veio pra fazer história e SOPHIE é uma mulher TRANS que veio para revolucionar o pop.
4835 2018-12-01 21:12:28 @AmericanAir can you pull it together and get AA5 in the air? Over 4 hours late and 2nd plane has oil cap issue.
4836 2018-12-01 21:12:21 I wish American politics was more open to left wing ideas, because it's a shame that Medicare for all is what's considered radical to so many people. When will we get someone talking about nationalizing oil companies eh?
4837 2018-12-01 21:12:10 Hi Jimmy,
Couple of things to think about:
1) Drilling for oil uses power
2) Transporting oil to refinery uses fuel
3) Refining oil uses power
4) Transportation to pump uses fuel
5) Storing fuel at pumps creates fumes that are vented into air
4838 2018-12-01 21:12:02 The liberals like Obozo tried to destroy the coal & oil industry to make green energy look more price competitive. The donors take their payoffs from politicians and give it back to politicians via campaign donations. Climate change is a corrupt liberal hoax.
4839 2018-12-01 21:11:59 Okay 
4840 2018-12-01 21:11:57 Anyone have recommendations for getting peanut oil out of asphalt? We had a turkey fryer mishap on Thanksgiving and now my driveway looks like the Exxon Vadez. Dawn ain’t cuttin it.
4841 2018-12-01 21:11:56 Cinnamon, sandalwood and ginger! I drink teas daily, sprinkle ginger and cinnamon powder on food and burn sandalwood in candles and incense.Also wear sandalwood oil and lotion.
4842 2018-12-01 21:11:55 Rosie, the purchase of TMX does nothing to add incremental barrels of oil to any destination.
The $4.6B aquisition currently yields about 4.2% yield to government from the toll charged on existing, contracted throughput.
You insist we should be somehow thankful; for what exactly?
4843 2018-12-01 21:11:52 Eating burrata with white truffle oil and drinking wine certainly feels like an apt reward for how much work I got done this weekend.
4844 2018-12-01 21:11:49 I’m in so much pain I burnt myself with 180° hot oil in work and have 3rd degree burns on 2 fingers on my hand I write with and use for everything I can’t cope

4848 2018-12-01 21:11:10 So keep digging up carbon? There isnt just a planet toll. There’s a staggeringly massive financial toll that albertans are about to pick up the tab for when oil companies walk away..

4853 2018-12-01 21:10:44 Ironic: Catena Zapata wine is being served at tonight's G20 dinner between Presidents Trump and Xi. George Bush's oil company was named, you guessed it, Zapata.

4857 2018-12-01 21:10:20 Someone plse explain to the nobs on CBC that only 1-2% of all the vehicles sold are electric powered, that tech is still a small part of Cda's GDP, that we don't all live in downtown Toronto, and global oil demand, now at record highs, is expected to grow for decades.

4864 2018-12-01 21:09:59 What else could it be?

How about the oil price shock?

Industrial unrest?

Diverting North Sea Oil Revenues into tax cuts and unemployment benefit?

The destruction of an industrial base?

Increasing neo-liberalism moving wealth up and out of the country?

4868 2018-12-01 21:09:27 شيعة مافي ايمان
4869 2018-12-01 21:09:13 No. I have a Pax vaporizer that uses dried mj. I use the oil when I am at home but if I need it when I am out and about I use the Pax.
4870 2018-12-01 21:09:12 I support Toronto getting cut off oil products tomorrow. Let's see how Hunger game you guys are. Roll the cameras! 1hr and that place would explode.
4871 2018-12-01 21:08:57 Please stop all the provincial payments that Alberta makes till we’re on the positive side of Oil income
4872 2018-12-01 21:08:55 The US is enabling the Saudis to genocide Yemen because they sell us oil and buy our weapons.
The US is enabling Turkey to genocide the Kurds because they buy our F-35s.
4873 2018-12-01 21:08:54 I live in a state where marijuana is legal and even have been offered a green card but I grew up with parents who were always high so other than high school never touched the stuff  but hold nothing against those who do smoke it it’s just not for me. I have considered Cbd oil
4874 2018-12-01 21:08:45 Unbelievable!!
Just Shea butter, coconut oil and deep conditioning with milk??
A year and few months??

Wow. Your hair is long and full
4875 2018-12-01 21:08:33 I hope you do, but remember the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
4876 2018-12-01 21:08:20 Herbert Walker Bush life accomplishments  were oil!!  I worked AA Intl Resv. and watched the psgrs. that went back n forth from Canada to Houston.   They were middle easterners and could barely speak english!!  Saudi's in oil business with Bush in 90's!!
4877 2018-12-01 21:08:09 GHWB was a HUGE player behind the scenes of this country’s advancement during the Cold War. My grandfather did business with him in the Texas oil fields.
4878 2018-12-01 21:08:06 Prescott Bush thru Union bank was convicted of funneling money and funding the Nazis after World War II and he paid a $5 million fine in 1945.  He became a senator & then moved to TX to make a fortune sending oil to S America under the table & became very very rich
4879 2018-12-01 21:08:06 Oldham bus mechanics. Hard to tackle owing to the oil, but a lot of knock ons for the same reason. Always on time to away matches.
4880 2018-12-01 21:07:59 97% of scientists (3% are bought off by Big Oil) accept #climatechange as a destructive force. So do insurance & seed co's, NASA, universities and all world politicians except Trump #fordnation & Twin Jesus's Kenney & Scheer. It's like wearing a I AM STUPID shirt front & back.
4881 2018-12-01 21:07:55 Yeah ML is entirely different from ME but it’s a subdivision of ME as well.
4882 2018-12-01 21:07:48 You have no idea how much of your every day life relys and profits from oil. But I do agree that things can change but in a realistic manner. And non of us will live long enough to see any noticeable benefits of said change
4883 2018-12-01 21:07:47 All the moaning but you all turn your heating on drive your car buy goods on line which need delivery fly to here and there. You all consume oil unwittlinly it has to come from somewhere !!!
4884 2018-12-01 21:07:44 Great! Time to start diversifying our economy away from oil so our economy is no longer at the mercy of global oil prices fluctuations. I’d suggest more investments into the renewable energy market. Solar now employs more than fossil fuel. Alberta can still be an energy province
4885 2018-12-01 21:07:42 cbd oil is a myth boys and girls
4886 2018-12-01 21:07:33 @Oreo I LOVE OREOS!!! BUT Environmentalists argue that this farming of oil palm trees is extremely bad for the planet. Palm oil production is said to have been responsible for about 8% of the world's deforestation between 1990 and 2008. #stopdirtypalmoil
4887 2018-12-01 21:07:31 Midnight Oil. Maroon 5, The Revivalists
4888 2018-12-01 21:07:20 I'm just gonna start eating globs of feta with olive oil and seasoning ITS SO GOOD
4889 2018-12-01 21:07:12 I got a 2 year plan out here in this oil field to retire in 5
4890 2018-12-01 21:07:04 Thank you Arlene we need more of your support, love your positivity but would love to see more of a fight from you. You know the danger we are in from this liberal government.  The oil and gas sector in the west is quickly crumbling.
4891 2018-12-01 21:07:03 S-- started to continue as oil.
4892 2018-12-01 21:06:59 When do you need your oil & filter changing Ryan?

What about your timing belt?

Glow plugs / spark plugs?

Checked your coolant..?

How’s your exhaust?

Mind your clutch with all those hill-starts..!
4893 2018-12-01 21:06:55 please tell me she gets to wear that oil at some point
4894 2018-12-01 21:06:49 The US is responsible for 1/3 of the excess carbon emissions since 1850, despite only having 4% of the population.  We burned the hell out of coal and oil which raised our cost of living here.  It is unfair to tell poor countries they can’t burn fossil fuels like we did...
4895 2018-12-01 21:06:37 After Oil they moved on to how best to dispose of the dead bodies of opponents.
4896 2018-12-01 21:06:35 Oil and gas contractors and employees out of work, people got no money. @cityofcalgary are u listening we got no money, no pipelines, having to work outside the prov to provide to families, consider moving like many others, carbn tax plus tax hikes and u were considering Olympics
4897 2018-12-01 21:06:16 CBD oil helps with my anxiety
4898 2018-12-01 21:06:12 #GHWBush has passed. 25 yrs on, the world feels ripples of our exploits in MiddleEast, while former KGB play long game for eco/geo-political power. As historical amnesia sets, it‘s important we know how we got here. Oil. Reminder: the electric car has been around for a century.
4899 2018-12-01 21:06:05 I need an oil change BAD and tomorrow is Sunday

Bitcoin is nothing but Virtual Snake Oil.

It is a worthless Scam.

Class Dismissed........!
4902 2018-12-01 21:05:46 We are talking of Metallurgically and materials engineering, where you do creep and nano technology, its a different thing entirely from mechanical engineering.
@Itz_OmaaaR is a graduate of ABU from that respect
4903 2018-12-01 21:05:45 Copper mines both destroy more land then oil pipelines and wells.
4904 2018-12-01 21:05:43 You, me, a kiddie pool full of baby oil! Lets go van!
4905 2018-12-01 21:05:37 oil
4906 2018-12-01 21:05:34 France should invade a country with oil.
4907 2018-12-01 21:05:33 جزاك الله كل خير.
4908 2018-12-01 21:05:19 Yesterday I mngd to knacker my back whilst sat in a chair.... it was hugely painful and restrictive.
Today I had the opportunity to try a cbd oil for pain relief, 5 hours later my back is twinging but not seriously painful.... huge difference from lying  in bed in agony
4909 2018-12-01 21:05:17 Did I say GHWB was wrong to liberate Kuwait, or that it wasn’t a good thing for global stability/security? No. All I said was that it’s hard to understand how security of the oil supply and Israel didn’t even enter GHWB’s mind when making the decision.
4910 2018-12-01 21:05:15 *RUSSIA, SAUDI AGREE TO CONTINUE OIL CUTS: PUTIN
4911 2018-12-01 21:05:15 Gulf War for no reason other than oil.
4912 2018-12-01 21:05:10 Seems like every time I sit down to sew I have a problem with my machine. I am about to head to the store for sewing machine oil. Christmas presents are killing me.

4915 2018-12-01 21:05:00 Do you want someone in office, who is ok with MBS/Saudi Arabia butchering Khashoggi?
(as the most recent transgression)
Are you ok with the USA selling out for oil/money?
4916 2018-12-01 21:04:54 Really the average person does not profit from oil. What do you think your every day life stuff is made of or how it's made. Plastics paints metals even products used in the clothing you wear. Not to mention how much oil is used in electric generation. The lithium mines(1)
4917 2018-12-01 21:04:54 I'd assume the Oil market is the same with OPEC?
4918 2018-12-01 21:04:49 Are you implying that dr Dre and Eminem are rappists????? Way to change the subject. I’m talking about white males that go to oil factories and live in man camps- they run around rapping anything they see. The research PROVES it! It’s disgusting and IT NEED TO STOP  
4919 2018-12-01 21:04:49 Looking for the article, it's about big oil directing education in Alberta to support a carbon economy through donation
4920 2018-12-01 21:04:48 ياجيزاني الله يشغلك في نفسك قول آمين
4921 2018-12-01 21:04:45 I think trains are more efficient than over the road. Breakeven on new pipeline projects would take a long time & will not help towards weening ourselves off of fossil fuels. We should invest in more sustainable energy generation methods. But conservatives only see oil.
4922 2018-12-01 21:04:42 Ok lets do it.
1. Get some good meat for long cooking (head or denver cut were great) cut to cubes.
2. Add a package of cilantro, half a package of parsley, a clove of garlic, 2 spoons of tomato paste (no sugar), 5 spoons of olive oil and 3 cups of water >>>>>
4923 2018-12-01 21:04:36 *SAUDI, RUSSIA TALKED REBALANCING OIL MARKET: SAUDI PRESS AGENCY
4924 2018-12-01 21:04:25 I get stopped on the daily and asked who does my lash extensions...they’re real bitches! Castor oil and vitamins are the key to fabulous lashes.
4925 2018-12-01 21:04:18 That goddamned sonic thing to root around on the floor for more oil and gas has got me livid. Any company that does this deserves to be outed and publicly shamed into oblivion. A true horror for dolphins whales & other marine life. Donald, I despise you & your trophy-hunting kids
4926 2018-12-01 21:04:17 Mostly right, in fact the first time an invasion was considered the UK and Arab League defended Kuwait, one of the main reasons for Saddam invasion was he believed were stealing Iraqi oil and driving prices down
4927 2018-12-01 21:04:02 Build her a little bath kit: lavender epsom salt, sugar scrub (you can make your own by whipping coconut oil, white sugar, and vanilla extract together), and a couple bath bombs. You could even throw in a fuzzy robe for ultimate at home relaxation!

4930 2018-12-01 21:03:49 Just cooked Marcella Hazan's pork in milk. Incredibly complex flavour. You'd think there were @ottolenghi numbers of ingredients, but it's just: butter, vegetable oil, salt, pepper and milk--and pork leg from the @GreenDoorMarket .
4931 2018-12-01 21:03:47 So...that Saudi oil we buy then??
4932 2018-12-01 21:03:40 George HW Bush was supposedly merely a Texas oil man in November, 1962, but there are reports that he worked for the CIA, even then.
Bush has said he didn't know where he was when JFK was killed, but it appears he was in Dallas.
Lee Harvey Oswald claimed to be a CIA operative...
4933 2018-12-01 21:03:18 Maybe if there was a way to get round the inevitable Barzani/Talabani carve up? As things stand it couldn't be a democracy. The big powers would only support if it became even more of a rentier state, selling cheap oil, as was shown in the indyref.
4934 2018-12-01 21:03:15 Killed a bunch of middle eastern people so that you could have some good ol oil
4935 2018-12-01 21:03:06 Breaking up standard oil just made Rockefeller even more powerful as he held majority shares in all the companies standard was divided into. But yeah I agree google is way to powerful.
4936 2018-12-01 21:03:05 2 weeks ago I watched Maryland line up for 2 points.  A successful conversion and our season is in the recycling bin.  

In 4 hours we play for a Big Ten Championship.  

So no, I don’t give a  about Texas losing.  Go blow the roof off Lucas Oil tonight and see what happens.
4937 2018-12-01 21:03:04 burn that midnight oil 24/7, profits up 2300%
4938 2018-12-01 21:02:57 oil sykes just posted a picture with harry styles & 2012 and also 2018 me are crying wow

4940 2018-12-01 21:02:54 If Kuwait had carrot fields instead of oil fields Bush and the USA wouldn't have given 2 shits about Kuwait, A Level.
4941 2018-12-01 21:02:51 Drizzle some olive oil over it, oven on 425 for about 25 minutes, and salt and pepper.
4942 2018-12-01 21:02:46 Windy and rainy. B1G football weather. Too bad so sad “Lucas Oil” has a roof. Sad, very sad!
4943 2018-12-01 21:02:45 That ermine-gland oil in here to be surprised how 'bout buying ol' Chunk a possible perp while in the station...

4945 2018-12-01 21:02:01 I use medicinal shampoos b/c I have psoriasis but I recommend avocado/coconut oil conditioners (herbal essence has good ones) & make sure you just let your hair naturally dry b/c blow drying just dries you out.
4946 2018-12-01 21:01:51 Ohk
4947 2018-12-01 21:01:47 Uniquely identify your assets with an #RFID tag to improve decision making and reduce loss in the oil and gas industry.
4948 2018-12-01 21:01:47 I normally bring the guys who do my oil change their favorite drink which is a blue Gatorade as a thank you tip - they hooked it up with a $15.00 off coupon today hell yeah
4949 2018-12-01 21:01:44 Crude oil production costs in Russia (and the middle East) are 15$ a barrel. That's why these countries call 50$ a fine price, don't they Trump ?
4950 2018-12-01 21:01:41 Obama needs to call Iran/Iraq and tell them that he is the one to thank that America is less dependant on their oil.  See how that goes over.
4951 2018-12-01 21:01:24 早起きさんだね！！えらい！！！！
4952 2018-12-01 21:01:21 I wonder how much of an effect the world’s fracking and oil removal contribute to seismic activity. Oil helps bedrock move with less friction. Countries all over the world are removing it at a dizzying pace. Fracking also causes earthquakes. The planet is telling us something.
4953 2018-12-01 21:01:08 How many layoffs at suncor, husky and imperial oil as they make millions off of the differential?
4954 2018-12-01 21:01:00 Scotland has more going for it than oil (even oil exploration areas were determined against Scotland!) + most economic models have been (by English) shown to (falsely) underrate Scotland economy to prosper on its own!
4955 2018-12-01 21:00:59 that was before all the polar bears died, right?  i wish i had visited ny city before it was covered with 2 feet of water!!  but since we ran out of oil and gas in the 1970's there is no way to get there, anyway.

4959 2018-12-01 21:00:36 17 people who all happen to already be in prison. Boy that's a tough stance by our spineless PM and FM. Yet millions in Saudi oil come in to Canada everyday. Can't upset the Irvings.
4960 2018-12-01 21:00:28 Saddam had plans on Saudi Arabia. He asked Bush to not get involved in both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. He offer the US oil at a massive discount for the rest of Saddam's life in exchange. I am not over-complicating it, I am telling you what Saddam was planning on doing.
4961 2018-12-01 21:00:23 A $70 oil change later...
4962 2018-12-01 21:00:21 LANDO’S OIL

4964 2018-12-01 21:00:09 remember when people were dumb & gullible enough to think the US entered the first gulf war to help people and not because of oil? I bet you do, amirite?
4965 2018-12-01 21:00:03 My family can no more get along with your family than oil mixes with water.

4970 2018-12-01 20:59:35 24. Hysterical calls for vilification of current governments responsibility by CPC & UCP as distraction from their documented oil sector management history and partisan gain. 2018

Now make a judgement
4971 2018-12-01 20:59:26 23. Jason Kenney abandons long held ideology and calls for government cutbacks on production of oil sands to preserve the viability of corporations that chose not to diversify. 2018
4972 2018-12-01 20:59:26 Respectfully Edd, the oil industry employees a lot of good people and the industry strives to provide a product as clean as possible and make as minimal of a foot print as possible
4973 2018-12-01 20:59:22 my boss got me an essential oil diffuser that comes with a remote im in luvvvvvv
4974 2018-12-01 20:59:03 It's not criticism, but understanding his origin explains a hell of a lot about his involvement in the CIA, the mujahideen, Nicaragua, why we served Saudi interests in Iraq, etc..  here's a clue - Iraq went into Kuwait because they were stealing oil.
4975 2018-12-01 20:58:48 Maybe oil will match upwards now.
4976 2018-12-01 20:58:26 I was there for that. Those meetings were always equally entertaining/bizarre at the same time. The one that stood out was the “burning oil rig” of 2008. Then they all thought FTP mobile would wipeout console. Now it’s Ai/procedural gaming. The sky is always falling....
4977 2018-12-01 20:58:11 i got argan oil in my braids bitch i ain’t broke
4978 2018-12-01 20:57:49 I hear you as well but really, as far as AB goes - I feel it is irrelevant who is in Ottawa - the chattering classes have demonized our oil to such an extent we can only recover as an independent state
4979 2018-12-01 20:57:42 Far left: Detest and call out war criminals for the millions dead around the world at their hand, the oil and resources stolen, lives and countries ruined. 

Liberals: Calling out war crimes is far worse than any of his war crimes isn't it
4980 2018-12-01 20:57:41 16. Trudeau and new NDP governments work together to strengthen approval process and support oil production during economic downturn. 2015-present
17. Trudeau delays all pipeline approvals, except TMX to redesign approval process with Canadian interests balanced with industry.
4981 2018-12-01 20:57:37 No. This is a failure of gov'ts since Lougheed's who all ignored his Heritage Fund and believed the oil economy would last forever. This is just the beginning. It doesn't help those being laid off. But the solution is a transition, not doubling down on buggy whips. #OilShill
4982 2018-12-01 20:57:35 Im at my local Honda dealership getting my cars oil changed and to my surprise and delight they are having a pet photos with Santa event! There are big and small puppers everywhere!
4983 2018-12-01 20:57:08 Jesus didn't forbid a woman to rub him down with oil.  So, there's that.
4984 2018-12-01 20:57:06 Wow, I remember the good old days when we had to buy our oil from the Arabs, who confiscated our oil equipment.  Now they are freaking out because we're finding alternatives to Arab petroleum and producing more ourselves.  What will they do when the Arabs tax sunlight?
4985 2018-12-01 20:56:57 13. Trudeau tasked with aiding unemployed oil workers, climate change & supporting oil industry. Huge impact on Canadian oil production due to increased Shale oil production. 2015 to present.
4986 2018-12-01 20:56:52 I Love oil sticks it’s like drawing w lipstick
4987 2018-12-01 20:56:34 12. Shale oil production aids US in energy independence. Obama’s stated goal in 2009. Huge job losses in Alberta oil patch. No federal govt help offered. Harper government defeated in 2015.
4988 2018-12-01 20:56:22 Coconut oil must be referred to as coconut cummies, I don’t make the rules
4989 2018-12-01 20:56:21 Spraying lavender or using a diffuser and lavender essential oil knocks Mr out like I've never experienced before
4990 2018-12-01 20:56:13 Lol I use any kind of cleanser at least 2 times a day when i wash my face i wash for at least 60secs each time using my fingers, after that I use a toner on a cotton round next I moisturize then i use almond oil with a little bit of tea tree oil.
4991 2018-12-01 20:55:56 Yeah, right now "Blockchain" is a popular buzzword used to sell a lot pf snake oil.

Almost every week I have friends & family asking for my opinion on blockchain opportunities that are, in majority, completely nonsensical.

4994 2018-12-01 20:55:23 I had a moment in time where I was desperately trying to find my Democrat mom so was arguing with her about Trump. Trying to convince her he’s a snake oil salesman. She started crying. Pivotal moment. I felt like shit.
4995 2018-12-01 20:55:18 i’ll buy !!! i haven’t spent money on oil in two weeks so we fat chillin
4996 2018-12-01 20:55:17 MBS will say “Look the Americans named our road after a guy I had strangled&dismembered!  That’s the only thing they did after I committed murder cause Putin & I have that dumbass @realDonaldTrump under our thumbs!  He has all kinds of nasty trump videos & I have oil”
4997 2018-12-01 20:55:17 @AlfaRomeoUSA  I have a 2017 giulia 2.0T. I can't find the engine oil specification on the user's manual. Can you help?
4998 2018-12-01 20:55:13 If they don't literally want the oil sector to sink, they're not doing a great job of sending that message
4999 2018-12-01 20:55:13 With the current situation(s) in the middle east and this..you can see the potential for all players to be present for the biblical Ezekiel 38 war...its nothing new...still about Oil and pipelines....and Power
5000 2018-12-01 20:55:10 i felt more disrespected when the dude sent my dad to steal oil and kuwaits riches while i was in kindergarten
and all i got in return as a broken alcoholic father
5001 2018-12-01 20:55:03 Hot chili oil is the best
5002 2018-12-01 20:54:57 and he ohhhh so screwed Bin Laden..on a large oil deal = now we have global terrorism
5003 2018-12-01 20:54:54 lesson learnt this evening... oil burners only need a drop of nice smelling oil, not half a bottle. on the plus side, my living room will smell amazing for the next 300 years.
5004 2018-12-01 20:54:43 He was in on the JFK assassination. His CIA put Sadam in power after their Iranian Shah lost power. Puppet Sadam gave him excuse to take Kuwait oil fields with a bow on top. His son did the same in Iraq while exploiting Afghan opium. #bush is everything wrong with this country
5005 2018-12-01 20:54:39 #Canada: Alberta Premier Rachel Notleywill announce a decision on Sunday on whether to require the province’s oil producers to cut output in a bid to boost Canadian oil prices.

BBG #OOTT
5006 2018-12-01 20:54:18 totally agree. there were some real opportunities under the first Bush. US oil companies were still pumping Iranian oil. But Iran began killing its enemies in Europe and elsewhere and that wrecked the chances for reconciliation.
5007 2018-12-01 20:54:07 They also bought a pipeline. Although cheap oil problematic effect of housing crash will be more severe
5008 2018-12-01 20:54:04 Have you tried taking your internal organs out and rubbing them with CBD oil cleansed with kale crystals?
5009 2018-12-01 20:54:02 3. Harper & Cabinet refused to take no for answer. Some oil corps choose to diversify oil production, adding value to their product for future indicated by Obama’s desire to be energy self-reliant by 2020. Harper & Cabinet choose to ignore diversification to refining 2009-15
5010 2018-12-01 20:53:58 Same! My dad taught me how to change brake pads, rotors, do a tune up, oil change, a quick fix in radiator leaks, body work and how to clean fish without scaling or gutting them! I took home each and learned how to cook, sew, make outfits and take care of a flour baby...lol!
5011 2018-12-01 20:53:47 Cool pic and I am gonna check out that beard oil cuz mine is getting pretty long( for me ) so I need to start treating it better.
5012 2018-12-01 20:53:33 @CoachWMuschamp @RayTannerSC make sure you get some to put some prayer oil all over the new OPS building because I have never in my life seen injuries like this year. #PrayThemUp
5013 2018-12-01 20:53:33 Hace 7 meses o mas no piso fuel oil
5014 2018-12-01 20:53:17 Your number doesn’t work, seems like the same scripted yes-men caller profile one would see on Coast to Coast AM. Really idiotic Trudeau bashing from people who aren’t smart enough to not put their eggs in the Big Oil basket job wise. Whiners. Trudeau didn’t cut your job, Oil did
5015 2018-12-01 20:53:10 George Herbert Walker Bush — Distinguished career: Fighter pilot WW II War hero, Yale University Graduate, founder of the Texas Oil Drilling Company Harbinger  Group and Zapata Corporation. Congressman, CIA Chief and the United States 41st President ,
5016 2018-12-01 20:52:55 Maybe the Bush family is afraid Trump would have brought up Iraq, Iran, Gulf War, oil, etc
5017 2018-12-01 20:52:50 It shouldn’t come as surprise to anyone Trump can’t wrap his tiny head around climate change and impending destruction it brings,bc Trump is actually HASTENING THE EFFECTS! Disastrous and deadly policies fm Trump/Wheeler at EPA, in conjunction w oil/gas Co reek havoc on environmt
5018 2018-12-01 20:52:36 I hope these niggas buy their girl some bundles this Christmas and some good oil if she natural
5019 2018-12-01 20:52:29 Well CO voted to keep the 500 ft rule for fracking wells vs 1500 last month.  Denver/Boulder wasn’t able to pass this because the oil industry people always always vote.
5020 2018-12-01 20:52:08 I just set the microwave on fire warming up a biscuit and a pan to heavy smoking with olive oil. I should not be allowed to cook anymore. #problemsolved
5021 2018-12-01 20:51:58 Yea I hate the actual taste of CBD, Ma Oil tastes amazing though, decade-long formula and highly concentrated CBD! I hope it works for you though!!
5022 2018-12-01 20:51:53 Lots of people with no jobs, contractors and employees, oil prices 2 low, BC and Quebec blocked Alberta pipelines, many have left the province, downtown is half empty, real estate is in bad shape, in addition to carbon tax they increase taxes. Awesome move @cityofcalgary
5023 2018-12-01 20:51:34 This is a BIG problem.  Just like the Alberta oil sector and the Ontario auto sector. Good thing Sock Boy is in Argentina pushing gender equality.
5024 2018-12-01 20:51:34 The guy that got the U.S. involved in a war for oil. Got that.
5025 2018-12-01 20:51:28 The glitter looks SO lovely! Have you ever tried embossing glitter? I'm not sure if it's something you can use on oil paintings because you adhere it with a heat gun, but you may want to look into it 
5026 2018-12-01 20:51:27 I thought the best one was @KySportsRadio not knowing your vehicle needs oil. #BBN And yes a great call in a game that took our Cats 30 minutes to really get going.
5027 2018-12-01 20:51:21 This is literally what happened when we scrimmaged that team at the ymca in oil city. It’s not even fair dude 
5028 2018-12-01 20:51:08 Yes, I do blame Bush for the consequences of that war. Why shouldn’t I? He propagandize for it, he led it, he claimed victory. And we're all STILL suffering from the global fallout from that disastrous war for oil.
5029 2018-12-01 20:51:08 Who has tried CBD oil and what do you use it for?
5030 2018-12-01 20:50:58 Breaking News: The UNHRC representative tells SOCHUM that western powers are only interested in Venezuela “because of her oil.”-The Sydney Morning Herald
5031 2018-12-01 20:50:24 You can't stop importing Saudi oil without a replacement.  The answer is pipelines, but we can't build them because the Prime Minister is making shit up about people that work in remote camps. Does he not realize the highly skilled work that is involved in these projects.
5032 2018-12-01 20:50:22 price of an oil barrel has dropped by 35% INTERNATIONALLY but u idiots keep praising Doug Ford
5033 2018-12-01 20:50:20 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
5034 2018-12-01 20:50:18 i just got a job offer for a major international oil company because i was wearing a beret BAKDBAKDNKS
5035 2018-12-01 20:50:15 Have also had cyberknife, 
Ganglion nerve blocks, Botox, snake venom, CBD oil and edibles, cymbalta, amitriptiline, nortriptiline, TMS, topomax, tegretol, menamine, neurostimulation, three jaw surgeries, and radio frequency ablation. I guess I’m treatment resistant. 2/
5036 2018-12-01 20:49:56 Cyril Mitchell what about the oil and gas revenue the Tories and labour steal off of Scotland no wonder they want to keep us

5038 2018-12-01 20:49:29 You can't just say a pyramid scheme isn't a pyramid scheme. Especially when you're selling snake oil.
5039 2018-12-01 20:49:29 CBD oil will help w pain
5040 2018-12-01 20:49:25 Lol. There’s far easier ways to make money... you seem to not realize that the grants scientists get are not salaries. They cover all research costs. Generally scientists are paid about as well as school teachers. You’re better off becoming an oil company founder. As I did.
5041 2018-12-01 20:49:22 Oh do behave. "96% of North Sea Revenue?" The Uk receives not one jot of revenue from the sale of North Sea Oil.
5042 2018-12-01 20:49:11 My account respects Peppermint Oil too
5043 2018-12-01 20:49:09 real ones use coconut oil
5044 2018-12-01 20:49:09 Its a social experiment and we're the victims there's a reason for this creation to collapse this country trillion dollars in debt paper money and oil.

-Broward County Florida's ballot magic
-The EU
5049 2018-12-01 20:48:47 FYI, petrocan is owned by Suncor, doubt they would buy oil from another country to refine in Canada when they have their own oil to sell.
5050 2018-12-01 20:48:31 Bought with all that SWERFy oil money, one would assume.
5051 2018-12-01 20:48:27 My boyfriend thinks it’s hilarious when he gets out of the shower and puts coconut oil on his body, specifically his balls, and says “I’m coco-nuts!!”
5052 2018-12-01 20:48:27 @MavisTire I just had one of the WORST experiences at one of your locations. My appt was at 9 am & for some reason my car wasn’t done until 2 pm (for an oil change & an emissions test), and your employees tried to defraud me of $600. IMO, as a lawyer, committing illegal fraud...
5053 2018-12-01 20:48:24 Worst case of manipulation is in the Coconut Oil Industry. 1000's of "scientists" present faux benefits of saturated fat. Heart disease #1 cause of death in USA, and Coconut Oil consumption increased dramatically over the last 10 years. Saturated fat hardens arteries (period).
5054 2018-12-01 20:48:24  Are you a gers fan? Happy to see Iceland independent? 100 years now. 300,000 people. No oil. Doing well. Very well. Then never let Toryscum billionaires con you into believing YOU are not good enough to rule your own land. If the Icelanders, why not the Scots?  #gersforindy
5055 2018-12-01 20:47:39 He was an amazing guy:
Youngest pilot in ww2, shot down twice, kept flying

Got rich in oil industry in Texas
US Congressman

Head of CIA and GOP
Prez and VP and father of prez

What a man!
5056 2018-12-01 20:47:28 @lookner Why are the French gas prices going up right as Trump is planning to saturate the market and drop the price of oil per barrel? Seems like Macron is trying to pull a fast one on his own people
5057 2018-12-01 20:47:28 Washed and changed the oil on the car and truck.  I’m glad it’s a beautiful day outside
5058 2018-12-01 20:47:20 Apply castor oil to make them grow faster lol
5059 2018-12-01 20:47:17 I was born and raised  in Alberta, I'm 58 and desperately want to separate. We are landlocked by the Federal government so we might as well keep or oil, equalization payments and break free. It is way overdue.
5060 2018-12-01 20:47:07 I am curious to know what everyone is protesting. I have only heard it's about oil prices.
5061 2018-12-01 20:46:51 She said wave grease & motor oil

5063 2018-12-01 20:46:32 This isn't about one signature, it's about the necessity and urgency of collective action if we want to have the slightest chance of saving our species. If govts keep building highways, exploiting oil and doing nothing to change habits, do you really ppl will change on their own?
5064 2018-12-01 20:46:30 the villains were like the Mark Zuckerberg of the oil world tainting the ocean

Ahh I just bet they do - Boris, just get rid of all the bodies and we will take over Sirte
5067 2018-12-01 20:46:24 Better than burping up a fish oil pill. 
5068 2018-12-01 20:46:22 When will people realise that taxes do not "solve" anything. They hurt the poorer pple, allow richer pple to virtue signal, fill the Gov's coffers. Tobacco, Oil, Coal, Alcohol, anything that pple want. All still used and growing.
5069 2018-12-01 20:46:17 Bush continue serving Big Oil/Wall St/CIA agenda, including funding the mujahideen/Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, then having his son go to war with them.  Overthrowing the democratically elected government in Nicaragua.  I could go on, the CIA never changed!!
5070 2018-12-01 20:46:08 No fah
5071 2018-12-01 20:45:53 This will say a lot about how the Oil are doing. 
5072 2018-12-01 20:45:46 Whip together 11 lbs ginger with 1 cup banana. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Freeze for 9 hours. Serve on bread
5073 2018-12-01 20:45:36 Gaz oil 1.50 * 1.02 =1.53..vous faites pareil avec tout le reste...!!
5074 2018-12-01 20:45:29 Invest in clove oil. Everytime your braces get tightened it hurts like a motherfucker and you’ll loose so much sleep. It’s better to rub your gums with Clove oil because it numbs them and gives you some time to fall asleep

5076 2018-12-01 20:45:23 Hay Brett usually I like and agree with what you say but picking on the solar industry is not fair. We need a healthy balance of both oil and gas and solar AB has some areas with great iradiance for solar
5077 2018-12-01 20:45:16 Thanks for doing it! Always some of the best Oilers content out there!
5078 2018-12-01 20:45:10 In oil money?
5079 2018-12-01 20:45:09 American small oil producers in the farm belt were saved by the Syrian American Qatari pipeline because they.could finally complete against.the thieves Bush and Cheney. It was BP with Blair that came in this connects to Elizabeth and Mintakans she works with, HAARP destroyered.
5080 2018-12-01 20:45:07 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
5081 2018-12-01 20:45:02 Even if France was given refined oil products free of charge, the French would STILL pay more for a gallon of gas, diesel,  and heating oil than Americans do.
5082 2018-12-01 20:44:52 Wants to save the oil...could give a shit about the residents!

5086 2018-12-01 20:44:36 I can smell the red oil
5087 2018-12-01 20:44:26 So glad I took Home Ec & Typing classes when I was in high school. I can mend my dresses and type on the computer. Some people say that’s sexist but it didn’t stop me from becoming a doctor! My dad taught me how to change my bicycle & car tires and how to check the oil in my car!

5095 2018-12-01 20:43:38 Isn’t it the Texas refineries getting rich off AB oil from the price differential? We don’t ship anywhere else. With no EnergyEast, on idea of local: is it better to ship crude from South America/Middle East to New Brunswick, or faster to truck value-added from AB to NB?

5100 2018-12-01 20:43:16 Alarmism. There was never any chance of letting him take any part of Saudi Arabia. Can you imagine how the US and the world would have reacted if there was any genuine threat to Saudi oil production?
5101 2018-12-01 20:43:12 I got an american cream oil hehehe might be tempted to get another.. I still have my lom perfume so I didnt get the oil but now I'm regretting it

5104 2018-12-01 20:42:30 My husband had heard of them! Do they have a small amount of oil and the food circulates through the oil? If so, my mum has one (she’s really into kitchen gadgets)
5105 2018-12-01 20:42:26 That's hyperbole. There is no scenario in which Saddam controls 80% of the world's oil if Dessert Storm doesn't happen. Run the simulation a billion times and it still doesn't happen.
5106 2018-12-01 20:42:20 とりあえず明日は出番がある可能性が半々だっ＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝_(：3」∠)_
5107 2018-12-01 20:42:17 The oil will still be above 60$/barrel next year. But stable prices of 80$ is presumably far away. Until spring or summer 2019? At least the economy in rich and poor countries will grow faster now. Despite rate hikes from FED.
5108 2018-12-01 20:42:10 Hi
5109 2018-12-01 20:42:09 I need to learn more about cars. Mainly how to do an oil change and stuff like that
5110 2018-12-01 20:41:57 Only you can determine how much oil you have. @BridalGlory
5111 2018-12-01 20:41:56 As someone who left student days long ago for a Ph.D. in mining in WA and a career in oil gas the very last thing I would recommend a student do these days is learn how to drill for oil. It's true we will need them for decades to come but it'll soon be in permanent decline.
5112 2018-12-01 20:41:47 Nope, I didn't like his policy.
His moral compass guiding his policy > oil, greed, money, power. 

Bush didn't die for my freedom.
5113 2018-12-01 20:41:47 It's not a photo it's an oil painting!
5114 2018-12-01 20:41:44 no clue how you ended up in my timeline but here (mine are GF so I don't know if it works with regular flour but it prob does):
3/4 C potato starch
3/4 C cocoa powder
1+1/2 C sugar
1 C oil
4 eggs
mix everything
bake at 365 to desired done-ness (I like em a bit gooey)
5115 2018-12-01 20:41:44 I was maced by three Bush supporters because I had a sticker critical of him on my car, driven off the road twice, and had that car repeatedly vandalized. A coworker told me i should be shot because I opposed his pointless war based on lies and oil profits.
5116 2018-12-01 20:41:41 Came to get a oil change now i might need new tires 
5117 2018-12-01 20:41:41 You're a con man, no better than a shifty used car salesman, selling the public snake oil.
5118 2018-12-01 20:41:34 3k miles overdue for an oil change, pure laziness
5119 2018-12-01 20:41:33 She's pandering to the oil heads trying to bring them into her camp, it's the only way she can guarantee her political survival.
5120 2018-12-01 20:41:32 I smell like every essential oil ever after an afternoon at #theawakeningcenter, but I ain't even mad
5121 2018-12-01 20:41:28 Perhaps you could’ve offered to pay in oil. They seem happy enough to take that from us.
5122 2018-12-01 20:41:27 @mariasldsilva OLIVE OIL XD
5123 2018-12-01 20:40:50 Saudi Arabia is not a great kingdom. It is a very backward country in terms of education, human rights, innovation and freedom. Wait till you run out of oil business, which is gonna happen sooner than you think.
5124 2018-12-01 20:40:44 Awww....so sad. Thankfully he's just in the beginning stages of 3! I give him low phosphorus dog food, kidney support supplements, CBD, Milk Thistle & fish oil. His numbers haven't gone up in 6 months! Whew!
5125 2018-12-01 20:40:41 I don’t think United have ever cared about City until the Oil daddy bought them. As hilariously pathetic Everton have been, Liverpool fans really care about the rivalry (I don’t really because I’m not from the city).

5131 2018-12-01 20:39:59 B.S. ibama tried to kill fossil fuels. He did everything he could to stop companies from drilling on public land.  Fracking is the reason America is the largest oil producer and ibama wanted to kill that too. So screw you ibama.
5132 2018-12-01 20:39:56 So dad went to O’Reillys earlier to order oil filters and he was talking to the lady that worked there. So he asked the lady for a filter for a 2011 and 2015 Duramax......THIS LADY ASKS HIM IF THAT WAS A DODGE!!!!!! IM DYING
5133 2018-12-01 20:39:55 Using skimmed milk, then adding back coconut oil an odd choice. They obviously wanted that distinctive sun cream flavour
5134 2018-12-01 20:39:37 Which essential oil is best to keep bullshit away?
5135 2018-12-01 20:39:25 Olive oil twister with Gav?
5136 2018-12-01 20:39:15 When esthetician say drying out your skin can make your skin produce more oil, it’s true. During a peel, they’ll apply alcohol on your face & within an hour my friend was SUPER oily.
5137 2018-12-01 20:39:15 if you’re not using warm coconut oil as a full body moisturizer you’re missing out
5138 2018-12-01 20:39:02 Oil capital of Europe and this bell end is pleased to make a donation.... ffs Aberdeen get a grip and let him know that this is unacceptable in every part of this country..
5139 2018-12-01 20:38:52 Magnesium.
Creatine.
Fish Oil.
Glucosamine.
5140 2018-12-01 20:38:49 Uhuh.  Failed weatherman Anthony "Global Warming my ass, it's cold here" Watts.  I think the German government knows more than this mouthpiece for the oil lobby.
5141 2018-12-01 20:38:41 Everyone knows he did it except 45, sadly oil is more important than human life. Humans can always be replace, oil apparently can't.
5142 2018-12-01 20:38:27 Do you trust a man willing or even contemplating sending a Turkish man back to Turkey to be killed for sure. What kind of man does this. Put your Patriotism on hold while Trump sells us out to Putin Saudi Arabia for oil. Which is known cause of global warming. PAY ATTENTION
5143 2018-12-01 20:38:26 Seems like the whole Khashoggi murder case is over. World has gone mad over money and oil. Nothing else matters. Humanity shattered.
5144 2018-12-01 20:38:24 Oh good. If it feels gritty it probably needs some cleaning and lubrication, a bit of mild solvent should help loosen up the old graphite and other junk that has collected in there before you apply some light machine oil.
5145 2018-12-01 20:38:23 fantastic day to be inside Lucas Oil Stadium
5146 2018-12-01 20:38:12 Great to hear that Tzeporah is going to dedicate her 2019 revenue from foreign sources to unemployed oil and gas workers. Class act
5147 2018-12-01 20:38:00 Said this goofy ass shit and fixed yo mouth to say I’m “trollin” lmfaooo you too lazy to oil ya scalp you the real clown 
5148 2018-12-01 20:37:42 World vehicle production, dominantly ICE,has increased 56% fr 2000-17.
Why are you people not laser focused on reducing consumption?
Stopping Alberta pipelines is facilitated by US interests that want to kill Canadian oil businesses, and ignoring record American production./2
5149 2018-12-01 20:37:40 Hahaha i know dis ones. Its just dat ML
5150 2018-12-01 20:37:39 Kept looking at that bag of red-skinned potatoes, so made a nice crockpot meal.  Potatoes, carrots, green beans, zucchini, vegetarian burger patties.  Bay leaf, celery seed, salt, pepper, parsley flakes, butter, olive oil, veggie broth, water.  Smelling good in here soon!
5151 2018-12-01 20:37:31 Add to MBS's sins a lack of strategic vision.  Russia can supply him w/advanced weapons, but little else.  They don't need his oil, so it's going to be cash & carry & forget investing in an economy that is smaller than Italy's & shrinking.
5152 2018-12-01 20:37:20 Ask Trudeau to explain scientifically why he keeps building oil pipelines if climate change is real?
5153 2018-12-01 20:37:20 And they’ve further promoted keeping EH&S regulations at a minimum for E&P operations in order to keep costs down. By most accounts, the US will be the largest oil producing country at some point in the early to mid-2020’s, surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia.
5154 2018-12-01 20:37:16 Sure, unfortunately no district in our state is going to reduce expenditures. And the Legislature is not going to change the funding formula to reduce/eliminate oil & gas $$ to areas where they prohibit drilling.
5155 2018-12-01 20:37:15 In a palm oil plantation?! 
5156 2018-12-01 20:37:05 No, it’s what global oil prices look like. China is paying the same cheap price that the US is paying.
5157 2018-12-01 20:36:56 #COPL I am hearing that December is where we put the bubbly on ice for this one. Plenty of news due this month and I fancy a multi bag to close out this year with market cap under £6m we could easily do 2-3p on some tasty newsflow risk minimal at current sp. #OIL #GAS #EQUITIES
5158 2018-12-01 20:36:56 Oil   ?
5159 2018-12-01 20:36:55 About 20kg, we got 80 last year which we got 11 litres of oil from
5160 2018-12-01 20:36:53 Being a leafs fan has been difficult for years. But not as tough as watching Chiarelli gut all the secondary talent on the oil.
5161 2018-12-01 20:36:46 Change those crusty, dried up windshield wipers, get new tires cause they’re slicker than baby oil on the floor and get an oil change.

Car Maintenance all 2019.
5162 2018-12-01 20:36:42 you don't want oil?

5168 2018-12-01 20:35:56 The Tories have always borrowed more than Labour.
Even when:
They wasted our North sea oil wealth
and
When they profited from selling off our national industries.
5169 2018-12-01 20:35:53 This is no doubt two cars having sex. lm surprised he didn't have a line about his motor oil 
5170 2018-12-01 20:35:50 IMO Bush41 was one of the most qualified, best prepared men -- WWII vet, oil man, congressman, UN ambassador, China envoy, CIA director, RNC chairman, VPOTUS & Yale baseball player -- to become POTUS. God rest his soul.
5171 2018-12-01 20:35:48 Well we have a history of INSANE 

We did all this in Detroit with the auto industry since at least the oil embargo of 1973 

45 years of massive tax incentives, bailouts & eminent domain to seize land for factories [UNHEARD of for private sector]

But passed by the courts
5172 2018-12-01 20:35:48 I'll be watching, baby oil tonight?
5173 2018-12-01 20:35:24 Why don't you come over to my house so I can bless you with my oil 
5174 2018-12-01 20:35:22 That is in hindsight. Think about if he controlled Kuwaiti oil and also Saudi Oil. Then he turned his attention to Iran a few years later. It isn't really about military might but economic might. If Saddam controlled 80% of the world's oil and could torch it at will, that's power
5175 2018-12-01 20:35:20 Maybe Canada should LAY SOME PIPE and stop buying Saudi Oil !
5176 2018-12-01 20:35:09 Energy East was killed by basic economics. Northern Gateway didn't have a snowball's chance in hell bc of completely botched engagement. TML was quashed in court for lack of proper engagement, but they did a much better job than Enbridge.

NDs have zero fault in our oil issues.
5177 2018-12-01 20:35:05 I’m disparaging Busch because he was complicit in the assassination of Salvador Allende and in Iran Contra. He was the instrumental in destabilizing much of the world on behalf of the oil industry that was the source of his wealth.
5178 2018-12-01 20:35:01 Sorry I forgot to add WR water resources and environmental engineering
5179 2018-12-01 20:34:57 Throw the rest of them in barrels of crude oil and close the lids
5180 2018-12-01 20:34:50 Israel has always been the aggressor since its inception, Israel wants the #GolanHeights so that Genie Energy (Rothschild) etc, can suck the OIL out of the Ground and sell it... They also have plans to expand Israeli territory, Israel has no rights to #GolanHeights period.

5183 2018-12-01 20:34:48 Were you there? With the olive oil?
5184 2018-12-01 20:34:30 Yes that metallurgical and material engineering
5185 2018-12-01 20:34:27 @GordonRamsay what do you do we oil after you've used it? Do you reuse it?
5186 2018-12-01 20:34:26 Ok getting dinner with some friends and need help pick the appetizer. Soup Dumplings, Spicy Wontons in chili oil or both?
5187 2018-12-01 20:34:11 My mom wanted to test out Amazon Prime to make sure it was working (moms are so cute) so she let me buy something & I chose an oil diffuser. Best decision ever!

5189 2018-12-01 20:34:03 So lovely to see the beautiful friendly wee face of Zoë Davidson today. Made my day. Sold a wee lip oil to a dude just after you left sorry it was a one unit.. 
5190 2018-12-01 20:34:02 I'd love to try this cleansing oil 
5191 2018-12-01 20:33:59 Ask him if Saudi oil is put through a gender lens.
5192 2018-12-01 20:33:58 excellent that's d way forward to bring prosperity in Baluchistan. plz do focus on organic farming & olive oil production as both hav huge demand in Pak and whole world as well.
5193 2018-12-01 20:33:47 The way Man Utd are going down, they will soon discover oil.
5194 2018-12-01 20:33:46 Sir Bose D K .. @sambitswaraj  can go down and get your oil .. he is director of ONGC becoz of this virtue
5195 2018-12-01 20:33:45 Probably do this so the aquariums, zoos, ect can't rightly point out that most of these natural habitats are dying thanks to oil.  If they make it so the zoo can't operate without Shell, they'll never teach kids the dangers of drilling.

5204 2018-12-01 20:32:33 just brushed it with olive oil with seasoning!
5205 2018-12-01 20:32:28 Drugs, land, gas, oil & minerals that's what USA fights for. Never about terrorism they are biggest terrorists on planet...
5206 2018-12-01 20:32:17 I am now officially "Oil Rig Bert"
5207 2018-12-01 20:32:06 I've seen some laughing about "doomers" "preppers" "peak oil" etc. Actually I'd say that the Mike Ruppert like perspective definitely broader than it was back in the day. Climate collapse is way more recognized now on so many levels. Even US govt top line now admits ten percent
5208 2018-12-01 20:32:01 My Gran would use this and I would cheekily refer to it as "Oil of old Lady"! I do not recall ever seeing it as 'ULAY'. ( I am a bit too chatty today, aren't I? )
5209 2018-12-01 20:31:57 I really need @bathbodyworks to bring back the Bergamot and Mint line. It’s the best oil and lotion I’ve ever purchased, and I am holding on to the last drops for dear life. 
5210 2018-12-01 20:31:35 If nuclear is that good, I've no problems. Renewable has to be better than oil and much better than coal, which is filthy.

5220 2018-12-01 20:30:30 I heard a biggins(sp?) reference and the oil changing one.  Were there any more.
5221 2018-12-01 20:30:25 Maybe it was the sanctions, or the ejections of diplomats, or giving Javelin anti-tank rockets to Ukraine, or trying to cut Russia's money flow off by selling LNG and fuel oil to EU, or killing 200 Russian contractors in Syria? Who knows? So much selling out.
5222 2018-12-01 20:30:19 I used to use brake cleaner to remove things from my skin like spray paint and such. That being said, it’s highly recommended that you don’t put it on your skin but it works. Baby oil sometimes works. Probably safer for children.

5224 2018-12-01 20:29:56 #JustinTrudeau will circle back on his slag of construction workers later, to justify foreclosure on the Canadian oil patch, 3rd largest in the world.

The 2nd (Venezuela) is already in the bag for #Globalist forces who leverage all for their control.

Nothing is sacred to them.

5228 2018-12-01 20:29:39 Can't be sure, but I believe this is in reference to his claim for the oil industry.
5229 2018-12-01 20:29:33 How could the markets have priced in cuts oil is down 30% after its worst month in 10 years!!
5230 2018-12-01 20:29:30 Can you include how diesel and oil in your car is refined sir
5231 2018-12-01 20:29:25 It drinks oil 
5232 2018-12-01 20:29:15 A total waste, worst president ever. He did nothing for the oil industry.
5233 2018-12-01 20:28:55 It feels gross to watch people praise a man who spread death and destruction, who's father funded Nazi's and helped for the CIA to cover it up.  Someone who helped cement the alliance of Wall St/Big Oil/Military Industrial Complex that plagues us to this day!!
5234 2018-12-01 20:28:51 They said that about the internal combustion engine from upon their high horses. 
Battery technology is evolving in leaps and bounds, only suppressed by the stranglehold of the oil industry.
5235 2018-12-01 20:28:46 Oil rag Robbins would probably say us scrotes have become too big for our boots. How dare we vote against their wishes and then have the audacity to demand democracy is honoured.
5236 2018-12-01 20:28:40 There are also untapped reserves (by fraccing) above the conventional oil/gas reservoirs of the North Sea, and much of Continental Europe.
5237 2018-12-01 20:28:37 Oh boo hooo cry me a river!  You got just what you voted for!  Now go stand in a corner and say "lock her up".....Maybe some of that snake oil is coming off you people....where o where is trump now.....
5238 2018-12-01 20:28:36 Let me think, we're selling Saudis 14,8 billion dollars in military hardware and everyday buying from them 80,000 barrel of crude oil.

5239 2018-12-01 20:28:31 Hold my dick i masturbate with medicated oil
5240 2018-12-01 20:28:13 Ahh the sweet values of an oil tycoon and he spawned W, headed the friendly CIA, killed lots of people through oil wars..Sounds like a true american hero.
5241 2018-12-01 20:28:13 I’m several days unshaven & my kid has a cut on her nose & has just emptied half a bottle of shiny de frizz hair oil onto her mop. On the bus & we look like modern day Dorothea Lange subjects
5242 2018-12-01 20:28:09 It's simple mate resources, and resources oh and resources.
What are these metal ores and possible ceramics and semiconductors and  probably oil.
Oh and frozen water the most precious resource in the universe.
5243 2018-12-01 20:28:05 I definitely have coconut oil, so I can try that. I suspect she’ll lick it of right away since coconut oil is delicious, but that probably won’t do any harm if she does.
5244 2018-12-01 20:28:02 well i have been cl;ose to causing afire once damned french fry oil      so isuppose we all   but by the grace of god went   tht day   i have since learned how to extinguish oil fire
5245 2018-12-01 20:27:56 Happens in the UK too. Fracking absolutely causes earthquakes & is just as big a threat as oil pipelines which get all the publicity here. But i also agree with those that suggested fracking isnt causing major earthquakes we see with the tectonic plate movements. 2 diff things.
5246 2018-12-01 20:27:47 Mattfying makeup doesn’t work for red carpet, you got your shoulder shiny and oil then your face looks dry.
5247 2018-12-01 20:27:45 *applying cuticle oil in traffic*
5248 2018-12-01 20:27:36 You have to respect these girls with nothing that start up a small business to support themselves because Nigeria is a mess. Whether it is Oil perfume, skin care stuff, clothes, whatever it is. As long as it’s legit. Respect them. It’s not easy.
5249 2018-12-01 20:27:35 Yeah it has a lot to do with oil because the pipeline in Syria goes all the way to the black sea. And what do you think Russia is going to do if they get control of pipeline? I'll prefer our government in this  case
5250 2018-12-01 20:27:32 But... But... @realDonaldTrump praised #MBS about low oil price?!?!?!?!?
5251 2018-12-01 20:27:30 i’m at the shop getting an oil change i forgot there’s lube in the backseat of my car oops
5252 2018-12-01 20:27:24 Also, gas prices needing to be reduced means the US can export more oil. Reducing the influence of OPEC nations.
Nationalists can be the ones to solve this issue.
5253 2018-12-01 20:27:21 Bush Snr epitomised the oil industry's powerful influence over US foreign policy. Bush Jnr was too thick to understand it.
5254 2018-12-01 20:27:12 Love that Christmas Nutella advert. “Enjoy as part of a balanced bwekfast”. How?? It’s got half the Amazons palm oil in and enough sugar in to give Jamie Oliver an aneurism hahaha

5256 2018-12-01 20:27:07 I have a marshmallow one which comes with a mini oil burner and sticks to melt them every day and if you think I’m going to get up 10 minutes earlier to do this every morning because I’m so extra you’re absolutely right 
5257 2018-12-01 20:27:01 @BradSherman @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast
5258 2018-12-01 20:26:31 Indeed. Think Thunder Bay or Superior Wis. Build a large tank farm. Store oil during the winter/spring. Ship during the summer/fall. Not ideal but better than nothing. Besides, climate change will stretch the shipping season on Hudson Bay.
5259 2018-12-01 20:26:23 Our decided stance on our separation from and use of our environment confuses me, why not aim to be more harmonious, when we have the tech to make leaps in that direction? Purely because we are addicted to oil and money? I don’t understand. Ha
5260 2018-12-01 20:26:16 Need: 
Towing rig, Just a full size truck and trailer.

Complete setup overhaul. Monitors, accessories, and a few hardware upgrades for my PC
New chair
RGB Lighting
5261 2018-12-01 20:26:02 your 18, buy a essential oil sleeping vape from monq
5262 2018-12-01 20:25:55 Oil Kebble. It is very rare for a Scottish side to have a monster that dominates in such a physical way. Honourable mention to Nairn. Perhaps with Hogg on his way there will be more room in the team for him.
5263 2018-12-01 20:25:49 At this point, nearly 100% of the decisions about things like patching speed or whether SMS is an acceptable second factor or whether to buy snake oil, pardon, "security products" involves things upper management doesn't understand _at all_, so they're generally flying blind.
5264 2018-12-01 20:25:37 Of course when I bring my car in for an oil change it has a recall that took forever to do! Causing me to have to drive in this blizzard, wish me luck! 
5265 2018-12-01 20:25:36 try clove oil!! it tastes very gross but it helps to numb the pain until you can go see your dentist!
5266 2018-12-01 20:25:35 Also I don’t use gum anymore either. It’s ridiculous!! If my breath needs freshening I use peppermint oil or thieves spray. I’m done with all the toxins of this world. People say, “I’ve made it this far in life...” unfortunately toxins are more common now though than 20 yrs ago.
5267 2018-12-01 20:25:35 It’s just been published that DJT GOP have reversed a decision by @BarackObama which now allows DJT to allow companies to drill in Atlantic & damage countless sea life etc. His refusal to accept climate change is part of a MONEY MAKING BUSINESS DEAL FOR OIL SEEKING SEA FRACKERS
5268 2018-12-01 20:25:21 So sad that you buy the rubish shoveled to you by big oil.
5269 2018-12-01 20:25:19 Fair point, but I am not trading oil, just looking for good spots to initiate or add to energy longs.
5270 2018-12-01 20:25:14 Start putting organic coconut oil on them you will see a difference in growth the first couple of days ! Thats what im doing and girllllll they poppinnnn just need to go and get them done 
5271 2018-12-01 20:25:12 Just use olive oil or mayonnaise. You don't have to spend big money on this shit.

He was also in Cuba around the missile crisis as an Oil man
5283 2018-12-01 20:24:09 Some consideration should also be given to the oil which is used to fry them in.  Saturated fat, (lard)  so demonized for so long, turns out to be safer than almost any other oil that is used. See "The BIG FAT SURPRISE" by Nina Teicholz.

5353 2018-12-01 20:14:57 The first gulf war was predicated on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and a pending threat to oil global production.  Had Saddam not invaded Kuwait, he might still be in power.  WMD was the ruse by GWB to justify 2002 invasion.  Linking senior Bush to that folly is historically false.

5402 2018-12-01 20:11:31 Idk how I never experienced beard oil until now.... but wow I ain’t never going back
5403 2018-12-01 20:11:27 I need an oil change so bad
5404 2018-12-01 20:11:22 Scott what do you suggest we use to replace oil in the mean time...this could become a reality and we r not ready. So we r open to your suggestions. Thanks!
5405 2018-12-01 20:11:20 H.W. paved the way for political attack ads.  He then washed tens of billions of dollars of taxpayer money with US & Iraqi blood for the benefit of companies like Shell Oil and Raytheon.  Who in their right mind would miss someone like this?
5406 2018-12-01 20:11:13 Your analysis lacks viable stats on oil market ..
5407 2018-12-01 20:11:04 He made his first million by the age of 40 in the oil business. He was an Ambassador to China, Director of the CIA, Vice President and President. He lived and honorable and remarkable life.
5408 2018-12-01 20:11:01 He has no shame, he'll soon join his brother in detention
5409 2018-12-01 20:10:57 Dump the POT now bro!!! Investors will sell pot in January to defer gains , now oil being sold for tax losses. Perfect pair trade
5410 2018-12-01 20:10:56 oil fall?
5411 2018-12-01 20:10:36 The govmnt is moving forward rapidly to conduct seismic testing off the Eastern seaboard for oil deposits. Permits issued for "incidental take" for the fish, dolphins and whales they know it will kill. Governors of all states protested, but preps continue.
5412 2018-12-01 20:10:34 Dr. Pepper is Texan af. It combines two very Texan flavors. Cow shit mixed with oil.
5413 2018-12-01 20:10:29 So what you're really saying,  is that we're can protect public lands,  protect the environment AAAAAND increase domestic production 88% ?!?!!!!

Because that's what you're ACTUALLY saying.  We can do both and the oil tycoons still make money. Wow.  Shocking
5414 2018-12-01 20:10:11 Creo que en este contexto "oil" se refiere a petróleo.
5415 2018-12-01 20:10:09 What happened to the massive profits made by NZ oil and gas from the Taranaki region?  

Why don't NZ oil and gas invest in Taranaki to transition the region towards sustainable energy production?

Why is your industry funded campaign so negative?
5416 2018-12-01 20:10:05 We must stop importing #oil
We all pay 4 tankers 2 come 2 #easterncanada. 
Our own country 
West has enough 4 all !

But we must start using #altenergy now. 
All new cars under 5000lbs ?
No combustion engines in downtown cores. 
Then we reduce our dependence.  
Someone?
5417 2018-12-01 20:10:03 trump administration approved seismic testing in the Atlantic Ocean in what would be the first step in expanding offshore oil and gas drilling to the East Coast. , the National Marine Fisheries Service said it had awarded permits to five marine contractors
5418 2018-12-01 20:10:03 ICE cars also use engine & g/box oil on a regular basis, most electric cars have little need for oil.
5419 2018-12-01 20:10:03 えるしっているか、遠藤氏は油しか飲まない。
5420 2018-12-01 20:09:59 True but we don't have to go as far as we've gone, where we put our military-industrial complex and oil $ on a higher pedestal than the ppl we're claiming to help, that just gives our enemies opportunities to rightfully attack us on our foreign policy
5421 2018-12-01 20:09:49 You think they won't?? Is it because you want their oil?
5422 2018-12-01 20:09:45 Beside myself that Cruz was re-elected 
It has likely permanently changed my opinion of TX

Mangled immigration & edu; two pillars of progress that need PROPER building

Texans think the rest of us should be quiet ?
When fedstops propping oil industry & poor immigration tactics
5423 2018-12-01 20:09:43 Alberta oil is the heaviest currently on the market though.
5424 2018-12-01 20:09:40 What would happen to Russia if Saudis lowered price of oil and increased supply. Don't think Putin would be smiling then
5425 2018-12-01 20:09:38 Market perception of Oil production cuts: Not enough
5426 2018-12-01 20:09:35 Just started a pathfinder campaign. I got a doubble kill by setting fire to an apple and throwing it in a pit of oil.
5427 2018-12-01 20:09:20 RUSSIA'S PUTIN SAYS NO CONCRETE FIGURES ON POSSIBLE OIL OUTPUT CUTS
#OOTT
5428 2018-12-01 20:09:18 @RachelNotley Only sell our oil to the highest bidder.
5429 2018-12-01 20:09:17 Oil they ur body
5430 2018-12-01 20:09:14 Dear CIA, Oil and money has won this one. Try and pick yourself up, dust yourself down for the next one.
5431 2018-12-01 20:09:02 It's a stinky essential oil and resin but I recognize the value of it. Ideal for helping brain cancer.
5432 2018-12-01 20:09:01 RUSSIA, SAUDI AGREE TO CONTINUE OIL CUTS: PUTIN
5433 2018-12-01 20:08:51 Absolutely brutal
5434 2018-12-01 20:08:49 I need some oil for this cold 
5435 2018-12-01 20:08:47 And because we just accept it we don't fight it. This is a war for our survival, anyone not helping us survive is our enemy. I don't approve of killing, but big oil is the exception. We either peacefully change now,  or face severe consequences. This is humanity's last warning.
5436 2018-12-01 20:08:44 Kwan kupima oil unatumiaga vidole sihua Kuna stick yake
5437 2018-12-01 20:08:42 OHH AND WHEN OTHER NATIONS COME CALLING FOR OIL SET THE PACE !!!
5438 2018-12-01 20:08:32 Dis guy everywhere kana nan kambu

5440 2018-12-01 20:08:18 RUSSIA, SAUDI AGREE TO CONTINUE OIL CUTS: PUTIN

So no new cuts?
5441 2018-12-01 20:08:05 Imagine being so hungry that you start craving the food you would natural Loathe. 
You'l be like;
"Yam and palm oil go makes like this I swear!"
"Yam and palm oil is the best"
"Yam and palm oil over Shawarma!"

May you never experience that kind of hunger this season.
5442 2018-12-01 20:08:04 Please write it down n pour anointing oil
5443 2018-12-01 20:08:02 time to buy coconut oil. or coconuts 
5444 2018-12-01 20:08:02 he did a good and honorable job of being a CIA spook, starting a war in the name of oil that damaged thousands of young men who came of age in 1990-91, and also sitting by as thousands of people died of AIDS, only acting when it became clear that it was no longer the gay disease.
5445 2018-12-01 20:07:43 I prefer to pay a little more for a speedy oil change at @jiffylube over waiting an hour at other places, but is it necessary to try to replace everything under the hood??  C’mon now.
5446 2018-12-01 20:07:43  oil for the win right now
5447 2018-12-01 20:07:41 Baby oil?
5448 2018-12-01 20:07:41 my God is bigger 
the pictures look like oil paintings 
5449 2018-12-01 20:07:34 This tweet fails to distinguish between the carbon in the forest, which was captured in recently, and carbon in fossil fuels which was stored eons ago. Hyping wood fires and sheep farts is oil company PR to get the focus off them. Too bad you fell for it, @ABC .
5450 2018-12-01 20:07:33 I heard because of the post office strike he dropped off the cheque for our next shipment of Saudi oil
5451 2018-12-01 20:07:30 Dem Bushes never cared bout us all dey wanted was da oil 
5452 2018-12-01 20:07:25 Done boss,Wish you success.
5453 2018-12-01 20:07:15 Because that would necessitate actually building #energyeast... and admitting we really like to consume oil.
5454 2018-12-01 20:07:08 tea tree oil diluted with coconut oil tbfh
5455 2018-12-01 20:07:03 My vagina and I can't handle an oil change un-escorted, apparently 
5456 2018-12-01 20:07:00 My fellow clean people how do you remove oil stains from clothes ? 
5457 2018-12-01 20:06:59 Bear in mind that North Sea oil & gas exported directly from the source does not get classified as a Scottish export by the UK treasury
5458 2018-12-01 20:06:57 Nervous the guys at the car place are gonna judge me for how long it’s been since I’ve gotten my oil changed. 
5459 2018-12-01 20:06:55 Love is wahala
5460 2018-12-01 20:06:53 Oh Yeah. Also look up who John Hinkleys Jr Father was a neighbor and oil executive partner with!!!
5461 2018-12-01 20:06:43 Eat junk 
5462 2018-12-01 20:06:31 I suggest Crude oil #IPissCrudeOil
5463 2018-12-01 20:06:23 Eucalyptus oil Helps me breathe at night -a few drops in the diffuser
5464 2018-12-01 20:06:17  make we set date this December.
I go show you around
5465 2018-12-01 20:06:12 To suggest that the struggles of frontline communities fighting Big Oil in the greenwashing context of pollution trading is “glamorous” ignores the realities of environmental racism. California’s real climate Achilles heel is the soft climate denial of cap-and-trade and offsets.
5466 2018-12-01 20:06:03 Та не за что)
5467 2018-12-01 20:05:56 I’m in the kitchen eating lunch with Mama Lorraine-Hyssop Essential Oil in the Diffuser. Very relaxing. And puts a smile on my face+in my heart.  #MamaLorraine #Diffuser #EssentialOil #Trending
5468 2018-12-01 20:05:55 baby powder, baby oil and body mist before going to bed is a must, nighty night 
5469 2018-12-01 20:05:49 Transmutation:  Grapes must be crushed to make wine Diamonds form under pressure Olives are pressed to release oil  Seeds grow in darkness. Whenever you feel crushed, under pressure, pressed, or in darkness, you're in a powerful place of transformation / transmutation
5470 2018-12-01 20:05:46 Haha. This guy ain’t no oil painting. I’m offended that he thought I was snapping him. 
5471 2018-12-01 20:05:38 And don't forget all the things to keep that IC engine going through the years, oil changes, new belts, new filters, new exhausts, spark plugs, injectors etc etc.
5472 2018-12-01 20:05:20 Lol abegii make I just leave u but I no say na kulle n dorina go get u if u pass 5pm
5473 2018-12-01 20:05:14 I have the rose hip oil, do you put it all over your face or only in areas that need it?
5474 2018-12-01 20:04:54 I lived in southern California  and it never rains their but man it pours. You can get more   than a inch in a couple  hours. They tend to have gutters  not Dwains to trap the water. There is always an oil built  up on the road washing up when it pours.
5475 2018-12-01 20:04:54 Today I got my oil changed without anyone having to yell at me for two months first!! So proud of you Gabe 
5476 2018-12-01 20:04:43 Reading the tweets & news, will #oil have a #paralell #system, like the #swift?

5477 2018-12-01 20:04:43 Your buddy Tom Hart right before the game was over poked fun at you again. I hope my taxi driver changed his oil in his car...lmao
5478 2018-12-01 20:04:36 We want to hear that USA can take care of these missles in a flash. If we stand back long enough these people will kill each other in the millions. It is the places we need oil from that we protect until we own them.
5479 2018-12-01 20:04:28 Чёрт, извиняюсь. Мой прокол. До меня же написано "Илья". Думаю, ты не сильно обиделся, я уже на автомате всем пишу в женском роде.
Про фобов же из того же описания узнала. Решила, что будет забавный факт. Тем более, песня то эпичная.
5480 2018-12-01 20:04:25 She's probably going to say "Your mother was like a daughter to me"
5481 2018-12-01 20:04:06 This will be an oil painting in the #whitehouse after he is convicted and put into prison.
5482 2018-12-01 20:04:02 At a coffee shop writing & drinking a Fat Water.Little kid approaches.”Fat Water?Whats the difference?”

5483 2018-12-01 20:04:01 Everything you've just proposed (taxing kerosene, diesel oil) will lead to increase in prices for customers. You think low-cost flights will be at the same prices as before if such tax will be implemented, or your DHL shipment will cost the same? Any green initiative costs more.
5484 2018-12-01 20:03:52 @KeepCanWorking @Torontosun @CP24 @JustinTrudeau @DougFordNation @AndreaHorwath @AndrewScheer @ChmlBillKelly If Trudeau and Ford cannot stand up for the people, get out of the way. There's no logical reason Canada is so reliant on oil or automotive. Manufacture and Produce!!
5485 2018-12-01 20:03:42 Good for Iceland?
Don't get excited Scotland. You only have a better climate, more oil and closer links to Europe.
5486 2018-12-01 20:03:42 Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman discussed oil, haven’t taken concrete decisions yet, including production cuts, Kremlin’s foreign police aide Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russian news service RIA

5490 2018-12-01 20:03:23 I'll be on there in a moment to keep pressing the point. LSE overrun by swampy shorting twats last few weeks.  Oil tells the story and they hate it. #UKOG
5491 2018-12-01 20:03:17 As well as our strongest trading partner, including 40% of our oil ;)
5492 2018-12-01 20:03:15 Fart oil.
5493 2018-12-01 20:03:09 Yep. Quid pro quo. And remember Rex Tillerson? Exxon has a trillion dollar oil drilling contract hanging in the balance!
5494 2018-12-01 20:03:09 How to get rid of any illness:

1) Drink 15 liters of apple cider vinegar everyday 
2) Rub coconut oil in your eyes
3) Stick kale up your bum
4) Snort 5g of quinoa each morning
5) Shower in green tea
6) Put turmeric paste on your eyelids 
7) Avoid meat, dairy, water and people
5495 2018-12-01 20:02:53 Mr. @BarackObama, how can u b responsible 4 making is the "oil exporting country" when u blocked Alaskan pipe, Keystone pipe, deep water GOM drilling for years?If u thought that we knew u were "the best", you wouldn't have 2 self-promote when out of office.#moron #narcissism
5496 2018-12-01 20:02:52 Nothing is as annoying as jollof rice with too much oil 
5497 2018-12-01 20:02:49 Lmaooo where dem dey do siren for us you never go
Na midnight crawlers we be.
5498 2018-12-01 20:02:29 Stay away from @irvingoil products.   They’re the ones  bringing KSA oil into Canada.
5499 2018-12-01 20:02:25 Mr Man you have no shame , you of all people, an ethnic jingoist, a renowned bigot, a fake news peddler and misinformer of the gullible still have the guts to deny what @ishakaa said.
You're shameless and will meet your waterloo soon.
5500 2018-12-01 20:02:19 meu rosto não voltou a ser oleoso como antes. mas eu também passei a ter mais cuidados com a pele que antes do roa! meu combo favorito é o sabonete em barra da Granado, de enxofre, e o protetor pra rosto Minesol Oil Control fator 30.
5501 2018-12-01 20:02:13 @AFP is busy exploiting the wicked and fantastically corrupt Fulani political thievery; the oil money they are stealing and looting from Biafra land. That's why they go about trying to write junk to cover their #paymasters. @realDonaldTrump @netanyahu @BBCWorld @radiobiafralive
5502 2018-12-01 20:02:10 What about if Alberta sells their oil for more money than we actually pay for it from the Saudis?
5503 2018-12-01 20:02:08 Dot...Dot...Dot.   Rosneft oil deal...Ukraine sanctions...Magninsky sanctions,  Russian oligarchs money laundering.  
The prize--Trump Tower Moscow.  
#TraitorTot
5504 2018-12-01 20:02:04 If they didn’t have oil, Saudi Arabia would be a pariah state.
As it most certainly should be.
And ruled by a kleptocracy, who use religion and brutality to keep the people cowed.
5505 2018-12-01 20:02:04 Also along the coast of Nigeria !!! The damage there from oil extraction is unbelievable !!!
5506 2018-12-01 20:01:55 While we are here, you guys should buy my original undiluted designer oil perfumes.
5507 2018-12-01 20:01:48 2) For a long time since PDP began to rule Nigeria, please sir tell us how much they  earned from oil. Two, tell us  how much they invested in capital projects in d country, in infrastructure, roads, farming mechanization,  power. Atiku is a good family man. Not a better choice.
5508 2018-12-01 20:01:45 The way Man Utd are going down, they will soon discover oil.
5509 2018-12-01 20:01:40 He's a charlatan, a snake oil salesman from the start. And he works the same way: ride into town, get some rubes to buy into his scam and then disappear. I think too many would have remained charmed by him to matter.
5510 2018-12-01 20:01:39 Big facts..... that whole family in oil and defense contracts.... you already know
5511 2018-12-01 20:01:27 Well I am old enough to remember that war, and I remember that it didn't happen because of anything Hussein did to Iraqis, nor did it remove him from power. It happened because Hussein messed with our oil buddies. Big no no. It was about money - not people.
5512 2018-12-01 20:01:24 ANC men with loose zips 1.Zuma 'maluma' body oil,Mbalula the sergeon/specialist of pregnancy termination,Jeff Radebe porn artist,Gigaba king of pornography and so on
5513 2018-12-01 20:01:24 Can't believe the digestives have palm oil in them why not use rape oil..  I'm staggered
5514 2018-12-01 20:01:23 Also if you want to get more commander exp per oil, try lb0 Yorktown Akashi & Shouhou (use 1 repair kit on all of them) Then 2 MLB US gunboats for vanguard
5515 2018-12-01 20:01:19 motor oil tastes pretty decent
5516 2018-12-01 20:01:15 No amount of anecdotes about how you worked in oil and never saw no rape is going to convince me otherwise. People smarter than us have done the research.
5517 2018-12-01 20:00:55 I read a lot of non-sense from foreign media on the #GiletsJaunes riots. This is not about oil prices anymore. It's a lot more than that.

It logically follows 60 years of  policies that completely forgot about the people
5518 2018-12-01 20:00:54 Too bad there were so many no-so-peaceful deaths on his account.  Bush sent over 4400 Americans to their deaths in Iraq, solely to benefit defense and energy companies like Raytheon and Shell Oil.
5519 2018-12-01 20:00:47 Chamberlain May’s treachery knows no bounds. Together with Oil rag Robbins she’s obsessed with selling us out to the corrupt EU. Those MPs supporting such treason should be ousted together with May and the civil service swamp thoroughly drained.
5520 2018-12-01 20:00:41 No! It's not better to be dependent from the fracking fuck from USA.. It's not better to be dependent from Saudis oil...
5521 2018-12-01 20:00:40 Listen bud I linked you the article with tons of peer reviewed research on how this is a problem for the people living there. You’re a nice oil dad who works for his family I don’t imagine you’d be deeply engrained in the culture that leads to this violence against FN women.

5526 2018-12-01 20:00:13 Sometimes I’ll hear a big fat quail hit the window, go look, see the amazing dander/oil imprint on the glass, but the bird has already jumped up & flown off. A little stunned but still able to know to get up & get going because in my backyard it’s a bird eat bird world.

5528 2018-12-01 20:00:10 i need seed funding for over-priced oil jobs for Housewives
5529 2018-12-01 19:59:59 Every time I bring my car for an oil change there is a conference under the hood with a lot of pointing and headshaking. Then whoever gets suckered into having to explain it to me approaches me like a doctor with unfortunate biopsy results to report.
5530 2018-12-01 19:59:58 You don’t use oil? Weird
5531 2018-12-01 19:59:56 the bread has been secured
5532 2018-12-01 19:59:56 Mfers be thinking they so damn slick. But what’s slick to a can of oil.
5533 2018-12-01 19:59:48 what's with coconut? I have been reading on the uses, coconut flour, manna, oil.. is it because of plant based?
5534 2018-12-01 19:59:40 Pineapple on pizza ruins pizza. Pizza is not supposed to have fruit on it, besides tomato sauce. If you like traditional pizza pre introdution of tomatoes to Italy,  go with olive oil.
5535 2018-12-01 19:59:35 I used to be a lefty @Realpersonpltcs & supported the Bushs, ya know how I got redpilled?! rite after 9/11 i got YELLED at by someone telling me it was all abt oil, and I got mad & yelled back. But tht guy planted a seed in my mind tht grew & grew!
5536 2018-12-01 19:59:23 If corn oil comes from corn, where does baby oil . . .
5537 2018-12-01 19:59:23 If they had no oil and gold the US and Bush would have never come to your rescue
5538 2018-12-01 19:59:10 We used to pick our almonds, deshell them and then fry them in olive oil & salt until light brown then bottle them in screw top jars and they were great for snacking

5540 2018-12-01 19:58:52 And to think, 'Big Oil' killed the Dinosaurs
5541 2018-12-01 19:58:51 I assume you heard the “change the oil reference”
5542 2018-12-01 19:58:48 In love with this oil diffuser my aunt bought me 
5543 2018-12-01 19:58:44 @mostlymartha just leveled up on Assassin's Creed after finishing the Oil and Love side quest or as she said, "I sex leveled up!"
5544 2018-12-01 19:58:42 It’s the reason why Putin helped him get elected, so he could drop the sanctions against Russia. But it’s also so your President and other Repubs can get in on that 500 billion dollar Oil deal with Russia and Saudi Arabia. Everything he’s done is to benefit himself.
5545 2018-12-01 19:58:39 UM YEAH. And the perfume oil. And Grass perfume. OMGGGG.
5546 2018-12-01 19:58:39 My understanding was NDP is anti borders, anti oil, anti pipelines, anti soldiers (said Canadian military are war criminals), more restrictions/end free speech, ISIS soldiers in Canada ok, etc. In other words, unelectable just like the Liberals they emulate.
5547 2018-12-01 19:58:35 It’s essential oil vapes which contains no nicotine or Tobacco u already had this convo with me

5555 2018-12-01 19:57:39 Prescott had one of the largest slavery plantations in Texas, so when Dems and Rhino's are praising this family remember who they are.
Getting into oil George would begin his very criminal business dealings, always having help by the shadow government to stay out of trouble.

5567 2018-12-01 19:56:05 make sure you wipe down your bowl and beaters w/ white vinegar. Any oil residue will mess up the process. 

Egg whites should be room temperature. 

Have I reiterated the importance of baking parchment Or how many batches of meringues and macrons I've gone through? Dozens.
5568 2018-12-01 19:56:00 Just as clean as oil and gas.
5569 2018-12-01 19:55:59 I went all the way to Boise to get my oil changed and they’re fucking closed. Fuck me for trying to be responsible

5573 2018-12-01 19:55:33 Well Mr Sec how about turning the sanction screws now and make sure NO oil leaves Iran by shutting down the insurance and credit lines of ocean shippers so shipment of Iranian oil is next to impossible

5577 2018-12-01 19:55:06 Trump shouted that the US had hidden reserves of power to impose asymmetric trade deals, steal oil, & make others pay but shadowy globalists ("Jews") had captured the state. Well, the US has no such power, & is even vulnerable to foreign election interference, amusing the world
5578 2018-12-01 19:55:06 Avocado and olive oil mix, 30mins in your hair, covered to keep warm. 
Makes it more hydrated and easier to comb. Add sugar if you'd like to make your hair strands a bit thiner, but I don't recommend doing that
5579 2018-12-01 19:55:02 Yay I made sesame oil cucumbers and a cucumber salad....heeheheheh excited...but idk what to eat with them rn
5580 2018-12-01 19:55:01 Both are invasive to mine/drill out of the ground. But the big thing to remember oil can’t be recycled after being used, lithium can be  personally there needs to be a viable mixed of ICE and BEV vehicles. The ave car has 4500 parts and BEV 450 swings and roundabouts 
5581 2018-12-01 19:54:52 Нет, порассуждать можно над шипом, это не запрещается. Но нужно видеть грань между "здесь есть определённые минусы, которые можно обосновать"(хотя и это зависит от контекста) и банальным оскорблением и осуждением за отсутствие логики

И да, напролом лезть в другой шип это плохо:(
5582 2018-12-01 19:54:38 “Oil rigs” 
5583 2018-12-01 19:54:38 And your solution is? Buy oil from dictatorships? Support murderers and thieves? Or do you think windmills & sunshine will power your energy needs? I ask in all sincerity - what’s your solution?  What’s your agenda? What’s motivating you? Incidentally, I don’t live in Alberta.
5584 2018-12-01 19:54:36 It's about Turkey reestablishing Ottoman Empire. Mecca & Oil was all theirs. They want it back.  hough he is vilified in US press compared to other Wahhabists MBS is a reformer.  Powerful forces in KSA will try to stop him. Erdogan had motive & opportunity aka a murder suspect.

5587 2018-12-01 19:54:11 On the east coast we use foreign oil and gas because the west and Ottawa chose not to build the "TransCanada pipeline" east of Ontario... we have been using this product for 70 years and now you need our ports?
5588 2018-12-01 19:54:04  I be Peckers legend.

5590 2018-12-01 19:53:48 What about all the aerosol in the cans of spray paint, and the crude oil that goes into making the picture for your profile?  Please tell me those spray paint cans are 100% recycled
5591 2018-12-01 19:53:27 Liberals love importing foreign oil and migrants
5592 2018-12-01 19:53:19 Gracie, your not really  up speed  on oil are you? Try and Google " Clair Ridge"  to see who's telling lies.
5593 2018-12-01 19:53:15 I assume you are a very young oil worker who knows squat about what FN women and girls have gone through and still go through. I assume you have not spent decades in a male dominated industry where sexual assault and harassment 1/2

5602 2018-12-01 19:52:35 No, oil staining is usually rusty reddish. Bird kept gaping which is often a sign of oil ingestion
5603 2018-12-01 19:52:28 Sending anti-missile defense systems to Ukraine n putting sanctions on Russia. He's done more against Russia than BO did, all's he did was send MREs to Ukraine n watch as Putin invaded them that's just militarily too. Trump has also started selling oil to Ukraine n other
5604 2018-12-01 19:52:19 What kind of oils my dude? But efficascent oil and white flower save lives
5605 2018-12-01 19:52:08 Me at 16: Damn my face is oily

Me at 26: If I don’t put roseship oil, vitamin c serum, coconut oil, and 2 moisturizers on my face every 4 hours I’ll literally die
5606 2018-12-01 19:52:07 @Walmart I get you have to randomly audit cars for oil changes. But having my car held hostage for 25 minutes for a manager to finally show up is ridiculous!
And no apology, just attitude from manager and workers.

5610 2018-12-01 19:51:22 All I can see is pkanla fish, palm oil  raw pepper and lizard egg 
5611 2018-12-01 19:51:11 China, by contrast, remains reliant on the outside world for supplies of high-end chips. It spends more on semiconductor imports than it does on oil.
5612 2018-12-01 19:51:09 Yes that is one thing you are correct on (access to market). But we both know the heavier based oil compounds are harder to process, meaning the cost of the natural resource will be less.
5613 2018-12-01 19:51:09 What about peanut/veg oil which the original Diesel engine was designed to run on?
5614 2018-12-01 19:51:00 Made their Fortune selling oil to Hitler..Ya what a family!
5615 2018-12-01 19:50:45 How many gallons of lube oil, grease and natural resources and fossil fuels are used for the construction, transportation and building just one turbine?   You do more damage to the earth dumbasses.

5620 2018-12-01 19:49:59 A lot happening at G-20,  Saudi ARAMCO concluded deal with China...Xi....to be major supplier of oil.   Biggest producer of oil to biggest buyer.  Next we will hear that the sale will be priced in Yuan.    More bad news for Trump

5623 2018-12-01 19:49:36 Isn't CO2 the main problem with venus.
Anyway I let the climate scientists sort than one out, not politicians.
The problem is oil corporations have better marketing than climate nerds.
5624 2018-12-01 19:49:29 Are you hosting oil wrestling tournaments now?
5625 2018-12-01 19:49:08 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
5626 2018-12-01 19:49:07 Oil, gas is highly centralized commodity. Every government want to control price of gas and taxes. We do not need oil we have SUN. Photo voltaic , solar panel , solar electric energy and electric car is our future. Blockchain (dlt) and daps like SUNCONTRACT =power to the people
5627 2018-12-01 19:49:01 If I went to change the oil and saw him there, he would probably attempt to explain the origin of the word "NO", while I was screaming it.
5628 2018-12-01 19:49:00 Did they use oil to start the fire?
5629 2018-12-01 19:48:59 What George H. Bush and I have in common : Gulf War 1
He arranged for Canadian Nationals working in oil and telecoms to be evacuated by America Cargo planes ( prompted by PM Mulroney -who was prompted by me from the desert sand )
5630 2018-12-01 19:48:59 oil change dude said my car smelled so good. hm wonder what it is?  he said hell yeah cant wait to get off work if ya know what i mean! stay green homie
5631 2018-12-01 19:48:51 We've been running out of oil since the 1890s. Daniel Yergin wrote about this in The Prize.
5632 2018-12-01 19:48:43 No, not at all. We'll see oil at $10 in the bust, probably late in 2019. But before the bust, we have a parabolic melt-up into a secular top. Oil has had a 35% drop in 2 months. Probably due for a bounce at some point before going lower.
5633 2018-12-01 19:48:37 Olive oil & bread
5634 2018-12-01 19:48:35 Show me where the conservatives have said they want to sell the oil to China.  You are mixing up the liberals and PPC parties with the conservatives
5635 2018-12-01 19:48:22 Nobody’s encouraging hatred. It’s totally fine to call someone who started a war for oil that wasted many lives a moron and a war criminal. It’s based on decisions he’s made that showed his lack of empathy to human suffering.
5636 2018-12-01 19:48:10 Spilled 2L of canola oil on the floor. Gonna be easier just to move out than clean it
5637 2018-12-01 19:48:05 Prepped & caramelized 5lbs of onions 

Got all the ingredients at the store in spite of leaving my list at home 

But my accomplishment of the day has to be catching the bottle of olive oil I elbowed off the counter before it hit the floor

5639 2018-12-01 19:47:42 I love the smell of tea tree oil 
5640 2018-12-01 19:47:36 I've always felt that the carbonized bread & the bottle of olive oil are, out of all finds, the things that connect me with them closer than even the plaster casts of bodies.
5641 2018-12-01 19:47:33 We should stop importing their oil since they want to cut out our businesses. Wow! We could then sell AB oil to Cananda
5642 2018-12-01 19:47:32 Picked up car at @JerrysFord for a $40 oil change and $135 key programming. They charged $28 in shop materials. This is #fraud at #jerrysauto. How many rags do you need or oil to dispose of? Key programming takes 0.

My wife booked at $99 alignment in line and showed up as $130.

5646 2018-12-01 19:47:11 i really need to wash my hair but that means i have to moisturize it and comb it and oil it and sigh
5647 2018-12-01 19:47:11 Wouldn't fry anything in olive oil... it has low smoke temp.  Use something with a higher smoke temp like rapeseed to avoid #freeradicals and reserve olive for cold foods/salad.
5648 2018-12-01 19:47:06 Love seeing you guys on Twitter! What’s your bestselling oil or vinegar around this time of year? Do people gravitate towards a certain one?
5649 2018-12-01 19:47:04 China’s not going to devalue CNY 20%; they’re going to devalue oil 20%.  At $35-40/bbl, “US v China” economic relative beauty contest starts to look quite different than current consensus narrative
5650 2018-12-01 19:46:56 And with a word the Saudis can turn of the oil. This is how the game is played. U really think this is the first time something like this has happened with other Presidents.
5651 2018-12-01 19:46:40 So you're just going to ignore the fact that he created over 200,000 jobs in October alone and that the USA is number one in oil production? You can believe whatever you want but the facts say Trump is helping the economy.
5652 2018-12-01 19:46:38 ur girlie here just sold her oil painting i’m buying more kpop albums friends
5653 2018-12-01 19:46:29 Any chance we’ll retaliate by building some pipelines and stop buying their oil? Didn’t think so
5654 2018-12-01 19:46:26 Looool

5655 2018-12-01 19:46:18 Saskatchewan's capital derived from energy assets can only be improved by having our own reactor. We are only province with our own uranium supply. Leaders lead. Where are our leaders on this critical approach to countering climate change without betraying the oil producers?
5656 2018-12-01 19:46:13 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
5657 2018-12-01 19:46:11 I don't think like a politician, crowing over who I can blackmail. I agree, sell all the oil even at a discount if necessary and use the money to build Nuclear plants in the Rockies. Eco terrorists will disagree but with world record levels of oil, we could build fusion reactors.
5658 2018-12-01 19:46:10 My prayer today is from a Keith Green Song, "My Eyes are Dry."

But what can be done
For an old heart like mine
Soften it up
With oil and wine
The oil is you, your spirit of love
Please wash me anew
With the wine of your blood
5659 2018-12-01 19:46:04 IMO it was a mistake to assign resource rights to the provinces, but that's another discussion. If North Sea oil hadn't come on in a big way, it probably would have worked.
5660 2018-12-01 19:46:02 ok beard oil and balm are the goat solely for me being able to smell my own face this is amazing

5664 2018-12-01 19:45:12 Yesss I literally just started doing water color and oil painting but so far I’m being really liking watercolor
5665 2018-12-01 19:45:10 A lot of people drank the Trump snake oil, but I empathize with the GM workers because they've been double-crossed. It is in these times that disparate groups become political allies because everybody knows what a double-cross looks like, and nobody likes getting double-crossed.
5666 2018-12-01 19:44:38 It's like having Noam Chomsky change your oil.  You know he can explain the origins of any words he says while under the hood, but that doesn't mean he'll remember to replace the drain plug.

5673 2018-12-01 19:44:13 GWHB deserves honor because he conducted himself with honor but at the same time his bloodlust for oil brought forth Desert Storm which left the scars that prompted 9-11 & leave us today in the unending Iraq & Afghanistan war with countless lives lost & infinite suffering.

5680 2018-12-01 19:43:58 Castor Oil and pineapples didn’t help
5681 2018-12-01 19:43:52 I never paid over 60 for an oil change, specially around here
5682 2018-12-01 19:43:49 True but until the demand for oil decreases, companies will continue to produce it. The ultimate solution is to get rid of demand.
5683 2018-12-01 19:43:44 The American Army went to Kuwait to protect American interests. It was a selfish endeavour as usual. Only the naive or disingenuous people will believe that America gives a Damn about Middle East ppl. Its all about the Dollars, oil and strategic interests. No morals whatsoever.

5686 2018-12-01 19:43:26 i prefer vegetable and olive oil
5687 2018-12-01 19:43:24 Never heard of oil flavored Combos before. But the pizza ones are p good
5688 2018-12-01 19:43:17 @LidlUK  Just tried your tagliolini with truffle tonight. Wonderful with a our own ragù. Probably would have great with just olive oil too.
5689 2018-12-01 19:43:06 Just found out some people fry their eggs in water instead of oil and idk how to feel
5690 2018-12-01 19:42:54 coconut oil or tea tree oil can solve most things but you gotta be more specific pal
5691 2018-12-01 19:42:49 .@realDonaldTrump is risking ~57,000 jobs and ~$2.5 billion in GDP in North Carolina for 65 days’-worth of oil and 57 days’-worth of gas #BlockTheBlast
5692 2018-12-01 19:42:41 You can go way back in history . Carter - Iran +Oil Crisis . Nixon = Vietnam , Kennedy = Bay of Pigs + Missile Crisis + murder , Truman = Nuclear Blasts + Korea ..... Lincoln  = Civil War + murder .  Rather remarkable I think.
5693 2018-12-01 19:42:36 Can’t help but wonder if Kenney’s idea of limiting Alberta oil is how Scheer plans on meeting the Paris agreement without taxing CO2.
5694 2018-12-01 19:42:30 What’s the coefficient on starting oil wars?
5695 2018-12-01 19:42:19 The poison Coconut oil stopped the stroke from happening.. Saturated fat! Then I came across @BelindaFettke on Facebook, tad later her husband @FructoseNo on a Twitter.. two fantactic human beings... I went LCHF and never looked back.. BGL stuck at 5.5..
5696 2018-12-01 19:42:16 If by majority you mean the very rich, oil companies, and the top 10 of the Fortune 500 companies, then yeah, history will be good to you.

Everyone else not so much.
5697 2018-12-01 19:42:06 I had a coupon for a oil change that I was gonna use today and it ended yesterday 
5698 2018-12-01 19:41:47 I wonder about that when I see people talking about homemade shaving cream made with coconut oil.
5699 2018-12-01 19:41:45 My multitasking skills are over 9000 rn... did laundry, cooked lunch, and changed my oil all at the same time, while smokin hookah lmao
5700 2018-12-01 19:41:38 Those animals depend on sound to navigate, to feed, to talk to each other. It isn't necessary, anyhow. If WE are gonna cool down the Global Warming thingie, WE have gotta cut oil use way down. USA is currently world's #1 oil producer! (OK... my head just exploded. G'bye!) ^..^
5701 2018-12-01 19:41:24 They think the earth is flat. Oil is the only energy for the future. Climate change is fake news!
5702 2018-12-01 19:41:23 It was time for her tuneup and oil change.
5703 2018-12-01 19:41:15 Knew i shouldn’t have gotten my oil changed at @Walmart , they broke my GPS mount :(
5704 2018-12-01 19:40:59 Not per the latest research. Olive oil@is best. See @drjamesdinic
5705 2018-12-01 19:40:57 Tax not prices. Oil is under $50 a barrel.
5706 2018-12-01 19:40:50 Imma try that black seed oil shit .. I heard it just makes you feel better in general
5707 2018-12-01 19:40:42 Used depleted uranium and destroyed the lvies of millions of american millitary. Defended US interests in oil. LOL.  You have no idea.
5708 2018-12-01 19:40:30 No, I never attack the victims of gun violence.  I attack the enablers that lead to massive death and violence, be it gun violence or presidents who start wars for oil.
5709 2018-12-01 19:40:25 Maybe when the technology is there in 20 years. Unless you enjoy constant brown/black outs or live in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, renewables do not work. It will be tough to continue R&D without oil revenues to subsidize renewable investment programs.
5710 2018-12-01 19:40:16 Many times been there Or “yeh course its got oil” hmm Adding after the engines knocked its big ends and rings out doesnt work 
5711 2018-12-01 19:40:13 this the part of USA policy ..creat situation for enter islamic states ..captured thier esests ..wealth ..oil fields and killing innocent peoples in these states ..but how long periods ? ..America must pay the price soon ..
5712 2018-12-01 19:40:08 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
5713 2018-12-01 19:40:07 Бля, мне понадобился месяц с начала карьеры шиперства, чтоб понять, что МеНя НиКаКиМ бОкОм Не КаСаЮтСя ДрУгИе ШиПы. И если меня бесит какой-то шип, я могу просто пройти мимо.
Но, я не смирюсь никогда с шипперами НЕ КАНОНА, что орут, что это КАНОН, и приёбываются к создателям.
5714 2018-12-01 19:40:07 Listen, As opposition leader she opposed the oil sands. Her whole cabinet did!
She blocked NG & sided with Trudeau on Energy East.
a job & industry killing carbon tax
She only panicked when the debt & oil did exactly what experts warned her about.
3 1/2 yrs to late.
5715 2018-12-01 19:40:02 What I read is that CBD oil is legal in Tennessee with a prescription but it has to be a regulated pharmacy and grown from industrial hemp.
5716 2018-12-01 19:40:01 having a car is cool and all until you gotta take it for an oil change, change the brakes, buy new tires, get new tags, fill up the tank weekly. Y mi papá no me ayuda so I gotta do it myself lmao
5717 2018-12-01 19:40:00 I was wondering why the photos i was taking of my art looked even shittier than usual, but then i wiped the smears of skin oil off my phone's eye and they look much crisper 

Gonna be posting some stuff for sale in a few hours
5718 2018-12-01 19:39:58 I’ve tried everything, but castor oil and evening primrose  I don’t want to have to get to the point of doing 2 stress tests a week
5719 2018-12-01 19:39:56 Thanks to the petro-Dollar. I wonder whether UAE can keep these zeniths after 5 to 10 years from now when there will be less oil revenue and more tax burden on companies in UAE. 

A good infrastructure and business friendly environment can help in sustaining the position.
5720 2018-12-01 19:39:52 GS research has a recent piece where they comment on that with some data on option volumes by strike, adding that decline of discretionary capital exacerbates oil swings
5721 2018-12-01 19:39:42 Mining oil from the sea is a environmental disaster, putting up windmills is killing millions of birds... Where does it end
5722 2018-12-01 19:39:27 Right now my life is definitely that good ol uphill battle metaphor, except the hill is covered in oil and I’m wearing rubber slippers with no grip...
5723 2018-12-01 19:39:16 Definitely needs an oil change. I’d say there’s no spark left in those plugs either, at least not for the current driver.
5724 2018-12-01 19:39:06 I had a quick look to see what you meant and I see they have 15 essential oils.

In the good ol' days they only needed one - snake oil.

Advancements in marketing techniques obvioulsy called for an expanded range. 

Do they also sell pyramids?
5725 2018-12-01 19:38:59 With older brother "helping" him changed the oil. I fucked up already but was fixed. Now I'm just answering what ever he wants or needs while he teaches me about it.
5726 2018-12-01 19:38:52 Partially, obviously the whole episode with chemical weapons was seriously bad judgement. His money came from undercutting Arab nations and selling Oil to the Us during the oil embargo. Pretty much all of his military hardware was Soviet made so I have to respectfully disagree.
5727 2018-12-01 19:38:47 Diesel oil.. in your car..so you can drive away :)
5728 2018-12-01 19:38:43 The way you dey smoke, e be like say you go need to change your engine oil...
5729 2018-12-01 19:38:32 Agreed. Eating there isn't easy for my wife due to her food allergies. She's allergic to seafood & can't even have the chicken because they fry both in the same oil
5730 2018-12-01 19:38:21 The response you made was burning more fossil fuel... Transporting oil via truck tankers burns far more fossil fuel that a pipeline. But Liberals only see what they want
5731 2018-12-01 19:38:07 I Luv Vodka!  Spritzer for your linens: 1c Vodka + 1c H2O + 16 drops essential oil: to disinfect & freshen
5732 2018-12-01 19:37:56 Actually, Saddam Hussein was put into power with help from the CIA. He even asked permission from the US to invade Kuwait, which I believe was caused by Kuwait stealing oil from Iraq.
5733 2018-12-01 19:37:53 .@michellemungall @GeorgeHeyman Don’t let industry off the hook by implementing weak methane regulations for oil and gas. Inspections based on looking and smelling for an odourless invisible gas just don’t cut it #bcpoli
5734 2018-12-01 19:37:46 Canola oil is high in MUFA like olive oil and has n6:n3 ratio of 2:1 which isn’t that bad. Canola oil goes through more processing than olive oil.
5735 2018-12-01 19:37:37 Actually it's not about oil taxes. It's about poverty, loss of purchasing power, disintegrating public services. Oil tax rise being the spark. But Karl's parallel is still relevant & funny, isn't he parodying self appointed specialists pontificating about the ME..
5736 2018-12-01 19:37:26 This isn't simply evil & heartless. It's also STUPID. The USA IS the top oil producer & consumer. Global warming is OUR problem.. & isn't going away.  ^..^
5737 2018-12-01 19:37:24 Its coming, some plague or virus to which the cure would have been found in a rainforest plant we have wiped out to grow palm oil.
5738 2018-12-01 19:37:20 What an embarrassment. I hope his wealthy, oil drilling, air and sea polluting friends are happy.
5739 2018-12-01 19:37:14 Skunk oil
5740 2018-12-01 19:37:12 Gotta change my oil.
5741 2018-12-01 19:37:03 Doing a Castro and coconut oil treatment this evening then probably will deep condition over night.  Need to get my hair back on trackkkk #CurlyHair #CurlyGirl #HealthyHairJourney
5742 2018-12-01 19:36:59 So, avoid blow drying your hair. It weakens the hair/hairline. Invest in natural hair products,you could start with Mikalla(leave-in treatment & conditioner), quite affordable, coconut oil and water... You'll see some change. Just be consistent
5743 2018-12-01 19:36:57 Did You Know? #US has no reason whatsoever to import oil from other countries. America land possesses enough oil to never need import it.
5744 2018-12-01 19:36:51 He has a point. Oil was discovered by secular minds.
5745 2018-12-01 19:36:45 Fascinating that in 1970s as Americans moved in to work at the emerging oil rig, the Scottish folk were shocked by curious Americans' diet which included... aubergine, courgettes and peppers.  bless how times have changed #fittiessquare #Aberdeen
5746 2018-12-01 19:36:44 “And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.” Matthew 25:8 KJV

Foolish had no spiritual discernment, and while they slumbered and slept (Matthew 25:5) they lost the word (Matthew 13:19-22, Mark 4:24-25) rather than “keep it” (Luke 8:15).
5747 2018-12-01 19:36:42 With the program history, the oil tycoons, the beautiful campus, and the 1st-rate facilities... the University of #Texas, has literally ZERO EXCUSES as to why they aren't a perennial powerhouse in college football. Lucky for them, they HATE #Oklahoma. So they got up for today.
5748 2018-12-01 19:36:24 Oil dey ur head

Hubby: I still think Lorelai’s pool should put out Skaarf’s goop fire

Hubby: good point... so his fire rises to the top of the pool...

5750 2018-12-01 19:36:12 Odd flex but I feel like some sort of old timey apothecary when I make the truffle oil mix for the fries at work
5751 2018-12-01 19:36:11 You'll get tired of lip balm...its palm oil that'll work
5752 2018-12-01 19:36:04 Just bought some essential oils to complete a balm kit I got from the natural cosmetics workshop, and holy crap who knew that rose oil was so expensive?! #essentialoils #roses #naturalcosmetics
5753 2018-12-01 19:35:57 Your saying Wallace was part of arranging and setting up the map for the one world order? I have seen the map and read up on a lot of it but never heard of Wallace being involved. Or anything on the Bushes supplying oil to th SS or Nazis. Bush Sr fought in the war! Just asking.
5754 2018-12-01 19:35:50 Have you been to fort mac?  Yes, the oil industry brought a lot of prosperity to the area but also brought a lot of public health and economic development challenges as well — local govts need to be conscious of these and act accordingly
5755 2018-12-01 19:35:44 I need a oil change where do y’all go for that
5756 2018-12-01 19:35:40 We need to get that oil to buyers who will pay fair market value. Canada suffers otherwise. #CanPoli #CdnPoli #tmx #TransMountain
5757 2018-12-01 19:35:33 The way our Manchester United is going down we will soon discover oil
5758 2018-12-01 19:35:30 I hope United avoid relegation and digging oil by touching lowest points
5759 2018-12-01 19:35:24 It got me when you thought an intercooler was for oil ol headass
5760 2018-12-01 19:35:15 I have a beauty calendar and today was a mini body oil bottle
5761 2018-12-01 19:35:13 The uproar should be against Aliyev , the obscenitly filthy rich who has stolen the oil revenue and lined his, his family and cronies pockets, empoverishing his nation!

5765 2018-12-01 19:34:47 This cruise ship emissions/pollution does not seem to be restricted by @Transport_gc  -  however, interesting Bloomberg article re 2020 International ruling re sulphur in fuel might reduce pollution AND make sulphur heavy oil sands fuel less desirable- also pipeline implications?
5766 2018-12-01 19:34:44 Why is the choice Marxism or the prison-military-oil-industrial complex? What's the 3rd option for (ostensibly!) civil persons?
5767 2018-12-01 19:34:34 I love how smooth my car rides after an oil change 
5768 2018-12-01 19:34:24 New subject! Palm oil free Christmas pudding, anyone?
5769 2018-12-01 19:34:24 Oil. You guys know that. Also, for investors in the war machine business to get richer
5770 2018-12-01 19:34:20 WTF, we're moving beyond gas, oil, and coal - why does Trump go f*ng backwards on EVERYTHING.

NO Science
NO Education
NO Healthcare

5774 2018-12-01 19:34:08 These other two oil hegemons who freely murder their journalist critics create a sense of envy in #ELGROPO ... who only rails at HIS journalists. It must really sting, too, because the USA is the world's TOP oil producer today! ^..^
5775 2018-12-01 19:34:07 Excellent work this has to be done for our provinces sake and jobs oil companies can only bleed so long before they start to trim deep and they have already several times to cope with this oil price!!!!
5776 2018-12-01 19:34:04 The syrup is not absorbed into the pancakes, it’s obviously a motor oil
5777 2018-12-01 19:34:04 Only @thebrittanyxoxo can put you in a trance and your mind into la-la land (or 7th Heaven for some of us) with a little oil/wet appearance, and a little flirting...  #PinUpModel...  Wow...  
5778 2018-12-01 19:34:01 From Cold War lies, to the War on (some) Drugs, Iran Contra, the Saving and Loan Scandal, and forcing American dependence on Saudi oil, Bush 41 was as at the center of the worst political acts of our lifetime. Not to mention his father's actual support of Hitler.
5779 2018-12-01 19:33:48 We store our fryer oil in BEHIND our salad spinner, so yeah, we're pretty health conscious.
5780 2018-12-01 19:33:46 Wewon. Do we want t venture into the premier league. 60's 70's players gave their heart. Sir Jack Charlton, 773 appearances. Sir Billy, Sir Charles, Sir Jones, Sir Reaney, Sir 90 miles Lorimer. @NoelDavidWhelan i see heart, passion in the league. Why move to the oil billionaires
5781 2018-12-01 19:33:43 Tho I love your Tweets and am a big animal/dog guy like you...I must politely disagree...Bush was a globalist who worshiped the 1000 points of light and who may well have been involved in the Kennedy assassination during his Zapata oil days.
5782 2018-12-01 19:33:40 It was a joke that I guess you didn't get. I totally support Alberta oil. Sorry for not making that clear.
5783 2018-12-01 19:33:38 My oil change is taking two hours so obv I went across the street to eat and drink by myself
5784 2018-12-01 19:33:33 Look we can argue all day long but the fact is you hate Alberta oil for some reason and you and the people you vote for are putting people out of work, yet you seem to think it is our fault for the position we are in!
5785 2018-12-01 19:33:26 How dare our PM recognize the contribution women have to our economy. All you care about is oil and gas, probably because they are in your pocket, and guess what... that’s part of the reason we’re in this whole economic predicament. Get lost Mr. Kenney. It’s 2018.
5786 2018-12-01 19:33:26 Doug, You have to pay people properly and regulate rents. You want to do neither. Again, it's a fancy box of cereal with a turd inside. You are nothing more than a snake oil salesman like @realDonaldTrump  It's obvious you don't care about THE PEOPLE!
5787 2018-12-01 19:33:25 Your mascot looks like a fat head who spilt vegetable oil exclusively on his face. It’s the stuff of nightmares and not in an intimidating way. Also while I’m at it, your mascot should just be a copier machine.
5788 2018-12-01 19:33:25 Yep they are but they have palm oil in them now 
5789 2018-12-01 19:33:21 I remember that. Under god just seems so submissive and just give up kinda attitude. That’s not what our forefathers had in mind. Maybe he should have read other books the history kind. Oil and god his son was same way. Its just getting worse. All about agenda 
5790 2018-12-01 19:33:17 $ETH=internet oil  Ever heard of EOS?
5791 2018-12-01 19:33:14 This is true but do we see governments forcing the oil companies to reduce the costs at the forecourt? No and why not? The car runs the EU’s economy and the car is a cow and everyone wants t milk it
5792 2018-12-01 19:33:13 Chop them up fine, grind a bit of cumin, rub into the potatoes with some oil and garlic, roast on a high heat. Gives a pingy Middle Eastern flavour.

5795 2018-12-01 19:32:54 One thing I like about oil paints is the colors look so wet somehow?
5796 2018-12-01 19:32:44 That time you didn’t had OIL MONEY.

5803 2018-12-01 19:31:53 The big issue with pizza hut is that the grease from their pepperonis soak into the rest of your pizza and it tastes like you’re eating a plate of oil
5804 2018-12-01 19:31:36 Obama is such a damn POS....He blocked the Keystone XL/Dakota pipelines, Bans drilling period, Now he's taking credit for the oil boom in our country that Trump has done..
5805 2018-12-01 19:31:20 Do you believe the reason behind the government's constant denial of knowledge about UFOs is to ensure big oil maintains their monopoly of oil based energy rather than free energy that's abundantly available through dynamos used by extraterrestrial crafts & built by Adam Trombly?
5806 2018-12-01 19:31:11 Oregano oil, DE,baking soda,apple cider vinegar
5807 2018-12-01 19:31:07 George Bush Sr. was a piece of fucking shit warmonger that took 100,000s of innocent Arab lives in the name of money and oil. Let the fucker rot.
5808 2018-12-01 19:31:04 Oh. I’m not “missing” it! Lol. But do we have info on #StopSaudiOil enviro & safety records? How many spills, incidents, releases & impacts does this oil produce? I’m willing to bet their enviro record is the shits too!
5809 2018-12-01 19:31:00 @Jake_E_W_Brown So you don't like oil drilling? Maybe you should ride your bicycle a hole. Lay off Sara Palin, she's 100 times the person you ever will be.

5811 2018-12-01 19:30:57 plz im just trying to get my oil changed stop telling me i look like debbie :(((
5812 2018-12-01 19:30:54 Watching #christmaschungalungas and screaming in horror 'bout oil paints...
5813 2018-12-01 19:30:52 the trend of ppl trying to follow bob ross tutorials need to end.... every time i see ppl use oil paints without precaution it hurts me
5814 2018-12-01 19:30:48 Неожиданная жиза. У нас когда-то из-за этой фигни разбилась ваза. Норм, чё.
5815 2018-12-01 19:30:39 There can be no trust given to the architects of the problem. Kenney, Harper, Scheer were all cabinet ministers/PM when the decisions that created the oil glut were made.

They are all currently in overdrive trying to distract from that fact.
5816 2018-12-01 19:30:26 Use oil? Or make fat less sponge? Any cake better than no cake 
5817 2018-12-01 19:30:14 Your largest canvas?? I’d like a 12’ oil painting of my dick in the style of the late Bob Ross.  Where can I send my sample pic? This will look great in my grandmother’s sitting room.
5818 2018-12-01 19:30:10 Can’t be saying fuck an oil change tho lmao  you’ll bounce back
5819 2018-12-01 19:30:10 Can never have enough machine oil...it don't spoil
5820 2018-12-01 19:30:02 Toitenga olive oil iye gore rino.
5821 2018-12-01 19:30:00 I feel sorry 4 u. International Relations 2 hard of a reality to understand,nothing to do with mouthpieces,it’s to do with the significance of Sudia Arabia in the world system, no country is willing to go against it fully, Oil,Islam-it’s influence in Muslims,regional importance
5822 2018-12-01 19:29:30 "Hey Vlad. I'm in the len's right now. Maybe i can slip out for a while for our chat. At least we got rid of that pain in the ass Post reporter. Our oil friends are really good at making ppl disappear. Sssshhhh.... "
5823 2018-12-01 19:29:26 Yeah, the word even sounds worse. Niggle sounds more gentle. Now what about a nipple?( Recent Arse-in-oil shirts seemed to be extremely tight and emphasized the player's nipples which became an obsession with the two brits who do "The Men In Blazers" show here).
5824 2018-12-01 19:29:09 Perhaps some actually statistics to back up this claim of gangs of oil patch workers pillaging local communities would be in order?
5825 2018-12-01 19:29:03 The laws around CBD oil are really convoluted. It typically only has .03% THC in it, and I think you can order it online? Idk, it’s weird lol. Text me, I can explain better
5826 2018-12-01 19:28:55 Killing regs that helped us reduce emissions, fighting CA on environmental laws, nixing solar rebates, installing oil execs or industry folks in the EPA, etc. and maybe worse than that, he’s giving legitimacy to people who deny climate science.
5827 2018-12-01 19:28:54 I recommend organic coconut oil for everything.  It’s cheap, it’s clean, and it works.  If you can eat it you know it’s pure. I hate to take away anyone’s income but I think these products are more emotional hooks than truly effective. And I’m no spring chicken either 
5828 2018-12-01 19:28:48 I guess you label an eco-terrorist anyone who dares to question the contribution of the oil sands to climate change - #climatechange #sciencematters
5829 2018-12-01 19:28:45 France,Paris protests against Macron and his Admin!The People rise again! Again on this cloudy Saturday France,proud people on the streets are protesting against the higher oil and gas prices of the socialists!Macron makes the bill without his people!Macron should act or Resign
5830 2018-12-01 19:28:44 I hope u know after i change my oil we playing deadops
5831 2018-12-01 19:28:41 The reply to me was about Eastern Europe. My statement was Eastern Europe imports the majority of Russian oil. The map represents Canada.
The only true self reliance isn’t fossil fuels it’s#cleanenergy. 
#cleanenergy has no environmental impacts unlike oil.
5832 2018-12-01 19:28:34 Are u kidding me.First class and u are rejected.While u will see their children or relation with pass employed in oil company.Hmmm unjust system.Wicked country where dey kill talents all because u are from a poor home but brilliant.God will judge u all
5833 2018-12-01 19:28:30 The way Man UTD is going down eer, they'll soon discover crude oil.
5834 2018-12-01 19:28:27 Did both of them steal their designs from a puddle of oil in the sun?
5835 2018-12-01 19:28:25 Alberta was plenty diverse before the NDP got elected; it's just that oil was making disproportionate contributions in being 30% of the economy but only 10% of the workforce.
5836 2018-12-01 19:28:23 Per 4 cèntims al gas oil
5837 2018-12-01 19:28:17  OIL IS A SEALANT NOT A MOISTURIZER
5838 2018-12-01 19:28:16 Will you be fasting from meat, oil, and dairy products too?
5839 2018-12-01 19:28:14 Headpiece (page 175) from MALELADE
Jean Tinguely, Henri Berend Sandberg
Oil on cardboard (1937) with collage additions
5840 2018-12-01 19:28:08 Can someone come w me to my next oil change cuz they take advantage of me/convince me to replace all sorts of unnecessary things in my truck cuz I’m v uneducated :((
5841 2018-12-01 19:28:05 More a scandel of carpet bagging at this point.What with Philip Mays company Owning $1billion +/- dollars worth of GWPharma. and others such as tory donor Paul Birch feathering their nests of vested interests. interesting Tilray got the NHS contract to supply CBD oil 
5842 2018-12-01 19:28:00 It’s a setup orchestrated by Flat Earthers and Big Oil
5843 2018-12-01 19:27:56 Normally when u see homeless ppl they hold a sign that’s says “hungry please help...GodBless” well as I’m leaving Walmart I see someone standing in the rain with a sign that read “Need cat food , gas , and  oil 
5844 2018-12-01 19:27:53 it’s both sides - had Graham won primary, think she may have won GOV + huge D mistake imo - her dad was FL GOV + SEN (loved) and he’s HUGE supporter of environment, oversaw BP oil spill + works w/FL Conservation - NPA so could not vote along w/3.7M others, another ridiculous law
5845 2018-12-01 19:27:48 @ManUtd United is competing with city.

We are just going down and down. A further more and we will find oil and then the transition is complete.
5846 2018-12-01 19:27:47 Fuel should be comeing down as the price of oil is down 
5847 2018-12-01 19:27:27 No, but you can vape thc, cbd and flowers in the proper tank/attomizer. They have cartridges I can put on my nicotine vape that have honey oil thc in them.
5848 2018-12-01 19:27:26 ... the sooner countries move towards renewables and away from oil, the sooner the HOS can actually be held to account...
5849 2018-12-01 19:27:17 Tom Moyane and Tax Administration is like water and oil .
5850 2018-12-01 19:27:09 Or they just know each other well and gave a friendly handshake??? Seriously.  These guys are too massive oil producers and one is in his early 30s
5851 2018-12-01 19:27:06 Coconut oil.
5852 2018-12-01 19:27:01 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
5853 2018-12-01 19:26:56 Which, ironically is clearly intended to make life better for the oil patch operators by constraining the tax burden the municipality can levy on industry. /2
5854 2018-12-01 19:26:54 We are searching for crude oil ,down the bridge #mufc #SOUMUN
5855 2018-12-01 19:26:52 #takeyourseat my message for @UNFCCC to combat climate change, we need to review human overpopulation, build vertical green cities, grow food in our cities. Use and store renewable resources, to use non-plastic alternatives, stop using palm oil, plant more trees around the world
5856 2018-12-01 19:26:51 so, when you alienate the saudis  and they raise oil prices and tank the economy, oh yeah, then they team up with russia and china? all for something that the saudis do every day. don't get me started on the human rights violations and torture of the chinese. but hey,
5857 2018-12-01 19:26:49 Let’s come out and support these beauty hockey players, 4:15 Casman Center as the PeeWee A Jr Oil Barons host Camrose #ymm @FMMHA #memories
5858 2018-12-01 19:26:43 Don't omit, Slant Well Drilling tech given to Kuwait 2 drill under border & STEAL from Iraqi Oil pool! 
Peak Oil forced that Tech innovation
5859 2018-12-01 19:26:38 Just to be clear, are you forecasting s&p 3500 and oil at $10 at the same time frame?
5860 2018-12-01 19:26:37 Manchester United will need no more Sponsorship deals coz the way we are going down we will soon discover Oil! #MUFC 
5861 2018-12-01 19:26:35 heat frying pan, tiny bit of oil, bit of chilli powder and garam masala and add cashews...oh and a bit of salt if you like (I do) and stir fry. Let them cool and store in airproof container (which is a joke because I rarely let mine cool let alone store them lol)
5862 2018-12-01 19:26:32 I used:
Water
Shea Moisture low porosity leave in detangler (don't really like this but it works)
As I am leave in conditioner
Crown of glory growth oil
Crown of glory edge oil

I really like the last 3 products. Before doing my hair, it was dry as a tumbleweed
5863 2018-12-01 19:26:27 you are missing that the embedded or related video messaging also speaks to beheadings and otters crimes against humanity - but those are ok - so long as the Saudi's don't interrupt their supply of crude oil to Eastern Canada ...
5864 2018-12-01 19:26:24 nuh uh obama gave us more oil
5865 2018-12-01 19:26:20 Agreed. Everyone knows that oil is infinite and doesn’t cause any long lasting effects to the environment. These hippies are paid by Big Sun
5866 2018-12-01 19:26:16 Amish Oil Country?
5867 2018-12-01 19:25:52 Soon American can invade Manchester United because of the oil we are drilling.
5868 2018-12-01 19:25:49 Thanks, following both of you!  I have chronic pain & inflammation & have been wanting to try CBD oil since I have read so much about it.
5869 2018-12-01 19:25:41 Why are you so resistant to anything that will diversify Alberta's economy? Why do you want to be so tied to the booms and busts of oil?
5870 2018-12-01 19:25:36 Soon Man urinated will discover Oil
5871 2018-12-01 19:25:25 2 life chickens.
2 life turkeys.
2 bags of ricem 
2kg of vegetable oil.
2 portions of rodo and tomatoes each. 

Period.
5872 2018-12-01 19:25:17 Hey @Arron_banks got a scam that I want to run by you... Am told your game for it... I want to lie to a load of people and then attack anyone who questions the snake oil we are selling.. saw your work on Brexit and i'm impressed...stop worrying about little fish like @jk_rowling
5873 2018-12-01 19:25:14 need the oil money #MUFC
5874 2018-12-01 19:25:09 "Oil prices are falling and factory orders are diminishing, reflecting slackening demand for goods"
5875 2018-12-01 19:25:07 Божечкиии 
5876 2018-12-01 19:25:00 In places where coal is the main source of electricity, importing US oil/gas is even a step in the right direction, until better options are available.
5877 2018-12-01 19:24:51 Boxing  and me are oil and water.
5878 2018-12-01 19:24:48 oil do more damage
5879 2018-12-01 19:24:28 Please explain how taxing the poor for the heating oil they need to keep their kids warm in the winter will improve the weather.
5880 2018-12-01 19:24:16 Premier Notley's oil by rail proposal finds no backers according to @ChantalHbert in TorStar, Dec 1. Disagree. Rail is highly regulated & more visible than pipelines. Spills on train lines are accessible by rail & limited to individual cars. Tankers/pipelines? Spills = Chaos.
5881 2018-12-01 19:24:16 In 2014 OPEC flooded the world with oil to destroy frackers. Economists said frackers needed $70/bbl to break even. Now the figure is $30. If fracking takes so much energy why does the b/e figure keep dropping? Look at facts, not propaganda.
5882 2018-12-01 19:24:15 where can i get some good affordable cbd oil i want to get some for me and my mom
5883 2018-12-01 19:24:06 Try Calia - it's an essential oil line. I don't dillute it, though.

OR the ever popular White Flower Embrocation, which is pure wintergreen and delightful.
5884 2018-12-01 19:23:52 Let us know if you made it to an oil rig or if we need to start a go fund me page for bail money. Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. 
5885 2018-12-01 19:23:46 ادعي لها با الهداية افضل. وكل ابن ادم خطاء. الله يغفرلنا جميعا ولها.
5886 2018-12-01 19:23:36 man i use to sip hard i quit when i got on papers nah i know how to leave that oil alone it’s that weed that i’m stuck on.
5887 2018-12-01 19:23:33 But solar, wind, green energy is not reliable. Nuclear is better but not safe yet. Radical change is destructive. Also gov. is not serious on issue as air/rocket, rail, ocean travel still dependent on oil/gas. What will replace plastic?
5888 2018-12-01 19:23:33 Texas better remove their heads from their asses & quickly, otherwise what happens inside Lucas Oil stadium tonight won’t matter #GoBucks 
5889 2018-12-01 19:23:26 "I don't mean to be disrespectful, but it's hard to remember Bush senior as anything than a traitor. He was a globalist, a gun runner in his "oil days", implicated in JFK's Assassination, involved in the downfall of multiple regimes, implicated in 911, a CIA operatve..." #MAGA
5890 2018-12-01 19:23:20 I can't see how , he never loved his folks at home .. to sacrifice precious innocent American souls for few barrels of oil .. incomprehensible .
5891 2018-12-01 19:23:12 Sadly it's not as bad as the stories politicians get from oil workers that were laid off years ago with no jobs and losing their home and families.
5892 2018-12-01 19:23:03 we should have let saddam slant drill into Kuwait and then stood aside as he attacked the Saudis to steal their oil too #Hindsight #2020
5893 2018-12-01 19:22:45 Why don’t the oil companies just go ahead and do that?
5894 2018-12-01 19:22:41 When I was a little boy in West Texas, I clearly remember the pride of many that a guy from the oil business -- from Midland even -- was running for the Senate.
5895 2018-12-01 19:22:38 my whole foot got soaked in hot ass fry oil , now I'm crippled
5896 2018-12-01 19:22:26 Answering @Felix Odhiambo Regarding energy production, 'We have enough rivers in western Kenya. Its poor and skewed policies that is letting us down.'
It is correct - Good Policy is lacking and this is right across the energy industry, both the hydro and even the oil and gas.
5897 2018-12-01 19:22:18 Russia's economy is based still largely on the price of oil, so Putey has to kiss SA's ass.

5900 2018-12-01 19:21:55 having lived there, for what it's worth, because it rains so infrequently, when it does, the streets are especially oily and slippery, for just that reason... it rarely rains, and therefore, when it does, the accumulated oil on the streets really does make it harder to drive
5901 2018-12-01 19:21:51 You n Yo mcm eat ya waffles wit motor oil 
5902 2018-12-01 19:21:43 I suffer so much too. Do you have a special brand of this oil?

5905 2018-12-01 19:21:10 The technology was present for a while. The twist is that people thought inflating oil would drive towards alternative energy services. They were right except it was shale oil.
5906 2018-12-01 19:20:58 @northsound1 #oilandgas #quiz since use are being so miserable about giving the winners nothing for winning it I am going to ruin it and say that #dyce won the oil and gas quiz against #bridgeofdon in the final
5907 2018-12-01 19:20:57 This is not a consumer choice. This is the result of subsidizing the oil industry. People are rational and if gas is cheap they buy bigger vehicles.
5908 2018-12-01 19:20:49 Albertas problem is green NGOs being paid by US foundations to oppose Alberta oil.
5909 2018-12-01 19:20:40 How many UNSCR did US Violates in the last 50 years including all the CIA and Mossad Regime changes all around the world. Killing innocent children for Oil and weapon sales and influence and control over different regions ?  Just asking for a friend
5910 2018-12-01 19:20:32 @KySportsRadio a little oil change jab from @tom_hart at the 16:00 min mark of 2nd half. #ksrmemes
5911 2018-12-01 19:20:23 To be fair, Bush 41 & 43 both pushed GOP to get Kavanaugh on SCOTUS. Trump & Bush interests DO intersect - however briefly. Bushes were in bed with Big Oil & deserve some blame for our current climate crisis.
So there's that.
5912 2018-12-01 19:20:19 @RachelNotley: the obvious solution to the oil price crisis, and the best policy for workers in Alberta and around the world, is to LEAVE IT IN THE GROUND. #abpoli #cdnpoli #stopextraction
5913 2018-12-01 19:20:18 What does oil do to the hair ?
5914 2018-12-01 19:20:15 We aren't changing our oil regularly and now our car won't run.
5915 2018-12-01 19:20:12 Don’t be silly I want the cheapest oil change, no add ons thankssssss
5916 2018-12-01 19:19:57 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

5924 2018-12-01 19:19:21 @JustinTrudeau could unify Canada, make amends with the West (since his father's time), increase revenue and the economy, create jobs nationwide, protect the environment, and increase western votes (who aren't as PC as once thought). All he has to do is build an oil pipeline.

5931 2018-12-01 19:18:55 Hard to imagine MBS lets oil stay below $60.
5932 2018-12-01 19:18:47 Just like Dick Cheney said that Iraqi oil would pay for the (endless) Iraq War. So much of America's money goes to pay for Wars. Money that could be spent on Health Care, education, job creation (like 1930s WPA and CCC), affordable housing.
5933 2018-12-01 19:18:43 Extra virgin olive oil is just normal olive oil that was homeschooled.
5934 2018-12-01 19:18:41 feel sorry for those watching this game that don't listen to @KySportsRadio They probably are wondering what the hell @tom_hart is talking about mentioning not changing the oil in your car, rear ending Maserati's, etc.  I'm over here rollin'!
5935 2018-12-01 19:18:39 Of course palm oil and lots of it.
5936 2018-12-01 19:18:38 @tom_hart I hear you with the @KySportsRadio oil references! I love me some @tom_hart

5942 2018-12-01 19:18:01 The best part of massage is the "happy ending". That's right, folks, I'm talking about when they let you oil up your belly and slide down the hallways like an otter
5943 2018-12-01 19:17:56 Secondly the 7500 tax credit goes to the consumer which the car company does not see at all. The oil industry gets 7 trillion dollars a year in subsidies and that includes environmental affects which affect our health and actually has more impact on poor due to living locations.
5944 2018-12-01 19:17:50 I will be creating a beard growth oil soon. I need a few participants to try it out. 
5945 2018-12-01 19:17:39 The amount of @KySportsRadio references in this game is hilarious.  “it’s like living in Kentucky and not knowing what a crew cab is” and then a reference about changing your oil.
5946 2018-12-01 19:17:28 He is correct that you have to put oil in your car

5949 2018-12-01 19:17:09 I need to stop wallowing in my migraine after-care and go do stuff.
But it is difficult!

Plus I might be addicted to this mint-lavender headache-soothing oil.
5950 2018-12-01 19:17:08 @KySportsRadio lol @tom_hart “you don’t have to change the oil but if you don’t it will blow up.”
5951 2018-12-01 19:17:07 I use tea tree oil in conjunction with warm water and sea salt. I use the tea tree maybe 3-4 times per week.

5957 2018-12-01 19:16:38 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, I think it’s time to investigate oil speculators, investment firms and oil companies.  How long ago did oil run to over $80 a barrel because of supply concerns, now there is a glut.  Market manipulation!!!,

5965 2018-12-01 19:15:24 What you also fail to realize and are ignorant of is that the oil industry gets hundreds of times more subsidies than what the ev and renewable industry is getting. So you should complain about that. The ev incentive compared to the oil subsidies is nothing.
5966 2018-12-01 19:15:20 You sell beard oil and beardless? Haba

5976 2018-12-01 19:14:40 I just bought my second whole-house Venta Air Washer (one up, one down). It humidifies quietly, it's easy to clean, and there are no filters to replace. A few drops of eucalyptus oil in the water and I'm feeling great. It's a must for the wood stove-burning season! #LoveMyVenta
5977 2018-12-01 19:14:39 Now a refusal to change your oil reference by @Tomhart towards @KySportsRadio and the best part, Dickey is oblivious

5999 2018-12-01 19:13:40 Someone pointed out the states represented by those Senators, from N Dakota to Texas, makes a line from the oil fields of Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Not all the states needed are included but maybe they couldn't get everyone on board at that time. Maybe it's nothing.
6000 2018-12-01 19:13:35 I think you need to worry more about the richest tax deduction that was just given. EV credits are to push and get us off of foreign oil. The money that goes abroad and to the richest oil co hurts the poor and economy more as well as what the environment does more to the poor.
6001 2018-12-01 19:13:35 I need an oil change today

6009 2018-12-01 19:13:09 I guess, but America predominantly relies on Canada for oil I think? So I really think it was all about oil=power?
6010 2018-12-01 19:13:07 I am not against you Tinman. I just like to try and get people to think more even if it means ruffling some feathers. Glad you are winning. the market si big enough for almost all of us until it isn't anymore. Look at OIL. not a normal fall.. HFT greasing the fall.
6011 2018-12-01 19:12:57 Can’t give up the oil... too much $$
6012 2018-12-01 19:12:50 @PrimalPet Been feeding my dogs Primal for years. Salmon oil?? Since when? As I sit in the waiting room of my local vet waiting for them to figure out what’s wrong with my dog who is very allergic to salmon oil, I’d like an answer. I’ve emailed customer support and tried calling.
6013 2018-12-01 19:12:45 a guy asked me to go home and stay the night with him last night and my response was i had to get an oil change in the morning

6015 2018-12-01 19:12:41 Starting the first Iraq war; dumping the Kurds and leaving them to die. He promised to help them against Saddam but instead, pulled out. Dickless Cheney wanted a war and control of the oil fields
6016 2018-12-01 19:12:40 It's staggering. Rachel Notley, who I respect in all but her stance on oil and #Tarsands development, says Alberta and Canada is losing $$ daily from pipelines not being built but how much is it costing us because polluters don't pay, don't clean up their stinking mess? #abpoli
6017 2018-12-01 19:12:38 The foolish virgins had the lamp or the word (Matthew 25:3, Psalm 119:105) but without oil or “power” and the “Holy Ghost”(1 Thessalonians 1:4-5). The power of regeneration (Titus 3:5); the power to become the sons of God (John 1:12-13); quickening of the Spirit (Ephesians 2:5).
6018 2018-12-01 19:12:31 I need an oil rig stat
6019 2018-12-01 19:12:31 But if I am a global oil consumer, I don't need to rely on Cdn oil.  And if I am concerned about climate change, I sure don't like the tar sands. Tar sands oil is expensive to get out of the ground (wasting water & energy, polluting ground) and difficult to transport. High risk.
6020 2018-12-01 19:12:29 Looks like an oil spill 
6021 2018-12-01 19:12:19 There's always oil change places and gas stations.  Anywhere that has anything to do with a car actually.
6022 2018-12-01 19:12:16 Those petrol pumps of assam where clean toilet and supply of drinking water not available for customers , their license should be immediately cancelled by indian govt. and oil authority.
6023 2018-12-01 19:12:14 Oil and oil products like plastics have done more to improve the lives of the poor than anything I can think of other than maybe antibiotics and mass vaccination.

Alternatives are good, we don't want to be dependent on a single energy source, but let's not paint oil a villain.
6024 2018-12-01 19:12:11 so my dealership puts a sticker in my car to let me know when i need another oil change , why the date say 02/30/19 
6025 2018-12-01 19:12:10 Remade my hair oil but I changed the formula slightly. Usually I do 3 parts almond oil to 1 part jojoba, 1 part argan, and 1 part castor, but decided to do 3 parts almond to 2 part jojoba and 2 part argan and 1 part castor.
6026 2018-12-01 19:12:09 I have COPD so I use oil.
6027 2018-12-01 19:11:57 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
6028 2018-12-01 19:11:57 Unprofitable does not mean cash negative sadly. But as coal mines are cash cost high and low sunk cost, the two are pretty close. Oil and gas - in the main - the opposite. Unprofitable, high sunk cost oil and gas (LNG, oil Sands, mega projects) are much harder to shut down.

6032 2018-12-01 19:11:36 Wasn't the oil they thought it was but they're still gonna occupy the territory anyway
6033 2018-12-01 19:11:35 Water should have a chance at least, to drench. Water damage as of right now is basically completely useless. Ignite damage should do more damage to encourage people to actually use the combo. Right now the slow from the oil is valued much more than the ignite damage.
6034 2018-12-01 19:11:27 The shale story could also be part of a pump and dump scam. Take a look at the debt laden companies comprising the etf USO. Buying panic events related to things underground are common in US history. How much energy needed to squeeze oil out of rocks? Net energy loss? Skeptical.

6043 2018-12-01 19:10:40 Which one of the central banks is going to take on QE in oil?
6044 2018-12-01 19:10:35 Those that call for keeping oil underground, are so misinformed. 
Pharmaceuticals, plastics, clothing, fertilizers are all extracted from a gallon of oil. Lubricants, heating oil, gas etc. Oil saved the Whales; prior to kerosene whales were decimated/oil lamp
6045 2018-12-01 19:10:27 Article that you linked too is just a bunch of oil executives making veiled threats that if we don’t give them lower tax rates they would move... of course they are gonna say that, shareholders expect them to.
6046 2018-12-01 19:10:26 Part of this change should be recognized as relating to the collapse of oil prices, the oil prices were so high in the early thousands that Venezuela should have been able tu parle its new-found wealth into further development, but in fact the opposite occurred
6047 2018-12-01 19:10:26 Walked the streets of oil-price-battered, sanctions-hit Moscow today & here's the number of signs of economic distress I saw:

None. Zip. Bupkis. Crap there is a lot of money floating around this town.

6054 2018-12-01 19:10:11 Well same applies to buhari and apc, the economy and oil prices were crashing before he came on board. He set up a regime of not sharing money, which Nigerians are not used to. Now they want a money launderer to be their leader to bring back the past

6060 2018-12-01 19:09:48 I remember my friend sending me a short story from her asian lit class where someone used sesame seed oil as lube and we were just like. why???
6061 2018-12-01 19:09:40 He was supposedly giving a speech there earlier in the day for the oil company. However he says he doesn’t remember where he was that day?? I remember and I was only 8.

6063 2018-12-01 19:09:16 The price of Potatoes isnt a Cartel in farmers... its a cartel in OIL and FUEL. They are the culprits. I don't want farmers percecuted. They don't put up prices for fun. They have real imput issues. 7cents to a farmer on fuel is devastating, generators, irrigation, treactors
6064 2018-12-01 19:09:07 #cocktailhour for #strictly is a Pink Cadillac: over ice 11/4 measures of tequila gold; 1/2 Cointreau; 3/4 each of cranberry and lime. Squeeze and add 2 wedges of lime (press runs for oil) shake and pour into salt rimmed glass. Add 3/4 measure Grand Marnier on top. Enjoy.
6065 2018-12-01 19:09:04 no they didn't, in fact they predicted that we had reached peak oil production worldwide over and over and over. still producing more oil than ever and it's likely to keep rising.
6066 2018-12-01 19:09:01 All about the Oil..! 
6067 2018-12-01 19:08:55 Sunflower oil produced for cooking started in the early 1800s ... other than some scattered native Americans using it in bread. Doesn't have the widespread and long history of cooking in animal fat. Animal fat tastes good.
6068 2018-12-01 19:08:46 Why does anything other than an oil change at a dealership take 4+ hours. You could take the whole car apart and put it together again. All I wanted was the fucking annoying beeping when reversing to be turned off... #dealershipprobs
6069 2018-12-01 19:08:38 Most of the boats are 'lakers' and they work between Thunder Bay and Montreal. Then there are a few 'salties' that go offshore, but they are smaller than most modern ships which are built to the Panamax spec. Not sure if any of them ship oil today.
6070 2018-12-01 19:08:23 Ok....so what can the US do about it. UN?

Beyond oil, Keep in mind mind all of the great Saudi Arabia is doing in the region.
6071 2018-12-01 19:08:23 I am,yes.
 I do actually believe that the oil industry is a beast that slowly kills itself.
 To move away from it would require an enormous sacrifice and a lot of lean times over a long period.
 I doubt it ever happens but whatever
6072 2018-12-01 19:08:06 Nothing is quite as beautiful as the Region landscape of barren trees, marshy prairie grass, rusting factories, rusting railroad cars, rusting interurban trolley wire, rusting utility poles, rusting oil tanks, rusting smokestacks, and rusting bridges this time of year.
6073 2018-12-01 19:08:04 @realDonaldTrump sir I am an Iraqi citizen and I tell you 95% of Iraq citizens will be happy if you take over us again and make Iraq an American state ( take all our oil and make us great again ;) )
6074 2018-12-01 19:07:58 Oh, and whatever happened to the dangers of federal overreach? Everyone in the WORLD wants a low CARBON FUTURE. Renewable power means energy security--no wars for oil, and a more secure, stable future for our children.

6079 2018-12-01 19:07:43 Girl, I referenced Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL). It exports oil.
6080 2018-12-01 19:07:38 @JustinTrudeau This is Alberta calling kind of in a economic crisis over here. How about you grow a set and stop buy oil from murders. We are now cutting production because you can’t get your shit together, and we are suppose to support Canadian dairy and steel right?

6082 2018-12-01 19:07:27 Im not debating this all day but you cant even prove statin absorption was affected unless you know what statin & when it was given in relation to mineral oil. Also still waiting on those studies on mineral oil & statin levels.
6083 2018-12-01 19:07:08 Black castor oil is really good for stimulating hair growth and preventing loss, it’s a really thick oil so best to mix with a lighter one but it’s brought back the sides of my hair and my eyebrows haha xx
6084 2018-12-01 19:07:07 I don't know if they're doing the kind of research along the Gulf Coast, but it'd be a great opportunity to look at oil degradation in warmer environments. It absolutely should be done.
6085 2018-12-01 19:07:00 I can’t remember what this other video was called but this man who’d wrote 2 other books on JFK went thru the JFK release and numerous assassins were in Dallas on the day and he had talked to a mob hitman in prison who said he did it. LBJ had the most motive and the banks and oil
6086 2018-12-01 19:06:48 the fact that @BarackObama made cars run further on less gas helped the oil Boom, Americans now use less oil which helps U.S oil Production and oil reserves @CNN @foxnews @msnbc @moveon @cnbc @WSJ @dcexaminer
6087 2018-12-01 19:06:46 Maybe. Over $80 is when broader impacts are seen globally. No coincidence the financial crash of '08 saw $136/bbl. Volatility and unintended consequences galore here at the end of the age of oil.
6088 2018-12-01 19:06:41 What is your OU connection Pete? Also how about some advice on dvn calls if oil pivots higher next week, sorry talking shop during football game 
6089 2018-12-01 19:06:34 My point is based on your statement. We have an NDP Premier who opposed pipeline in the past, who opposed the oil and gas sector and is now advocating for pipeline and oil export. That means something must be very wrong, to have that occur.
6090 2018-12-01 19:06:31 U kno the fact that oils is right up there with sugars in the ONLY HAVE A TINY BIT OF THIS section is rly telling when everyone cooks everything in oil
6091 2018-12-01 19:06:26 Next time there's an oil spill I'm just going to head down to wherever it is and toss my glasses in the middle of it. I promise you it will draw every single oil particle and bit of dirt in the area directly to the lenses and defy all attempts to remove them
6092 2018-12-01 19:06:24 The palm oil & the orangutans was something I never knew.
6093 2018-12-01 19:06:23 So what does that have to do with anything? We should never produce oil because men work in camp sites? Idiot
6094 2018-12-01 19:06:10 Well, so it was! OED has it as 'A substitute for butter, made from the oil of nut', proprietary name. First instance 1906, and this book is 1910. The capital letter supports this. Thanks!
6095 2018-12-01 19:06:01 Let’s just say oil pulling after having a Taco Bell Crunchwrap was a bad idea
6096 2018-12-01 19:05:57 World coal production grew by 105 metric tones in 2017. Global oil consumption growth averaged 1.8%, or 1.7 million barrels per day in 2017. There will be a 30% increase of world energy use by 2040 #COP24 #climatechange
6097 2018-12-01 19:05:53 Oil
6098 2018-12-01 19:05:50 No. I am not saying you are not relevant. Especially to YOUR life. But it is not in the same context as a world leader. He killed people. I don’t care if it was with a coalition. It does not make it right. It was for oil. The families of the people who1)
6099 2018-12-01 19:05:34 #Economy #Brexit Differences  in Vehicle Fuel tax policies are of course the main reason for the wide variations  in fuel prices.  Just about anywhere you go it is #Governments rather  than the oil companies themselves that are raking it in when you pay at  the pump.
6100 2018-12-01 19:05:28 so deep I found oil
6101 2018-12-01 19:05:03 It actually discriminated against Saudi oil! Says right on the hashtag!
6102 2018-12-01 19:04:53 Happy Birthday Sir, may the oil upon your life never dry up, more Grace to upon your life and you shall finish well in JESUS mighty name
6103 2018-12-01 19:04:52 Alaskans own 382,715 shares of SURGUTNEFTEGAS OJSC, worth $1,779,989. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in RUSSIA.

6108 2018-12-01 19:04:05 Lol @#dryoil. There are elements of truth in your tweets but my point is not all of the north nor all of Muslims supported BH at infancy. Any insinuation of such in unfair to the moderate Muslims and liberal indigenes of Northern Nigeria. Again, not even dry oil can break Ngr.
6109 2018-12-01 19:04:00 Don't believe the spin. Canada is best in class in responsible resource development:
"I have worked in the oil & gas industry for 30 yrs, I have witnessed the industry standards make leaps & bounds, in environment standards...

6110 2018-12-01 19:03:52 Meanwhile oil & rates drop, debt soars, housing/autos obliterated, GDP revisions lowered everywhere and global equities other than US tell the truth. US inv stilll believe nothing will take the US down and thst CB gimmicks keep working in a time they won't. It'll hurt.
6111 2018-12-01 19:03:51 Yeah but he didn't have to fight in the desert storm that killed so many Americans Katie. Another war for oil war. So there is that Katie. Not a huge fan of war presidents. Especially for frivolous reasons. Like oil. Come on Katie.
6112 2018-12-01 19:03:44 My hobby is repurposing olive oil bottles into bottles with other liquids in them. You can buy them on Etsy now! Some have vegetable oil in them or not as virgin olive oil. They’re $5000! SO CHEAP!
6113 2018-12-01 19:03:38 I'd love to see the apprentice's arcane barrier changed for a lighting elemental tower so we could have a nice elemental hero.

As for combos, I'd be fine if we just had more than drench + electric doing stuns and oil + fire doing more damage.
6114 2018-12-01 19:03:06 gonna buy some castor oil to chug tomorrow to 1) put on my hair and 2) use as lax so I can be as empty as possible on monday morning for my weigh in HAHA we love health in this house
6115 2018-12-01 19:03:04 Do you use oil? Did you know that it comes from countries like Saudi Arabia, where being gay is punishable by death?
6116 2018-12-01 19:03:04 Chavez gave oil to China, Iran and Cuba. England got some too.
6117 2018-12-01 19:03:01 Don't forget Rosneft oil deal. I think that's the name of the company.
6118 2018-12-01 19:02:52 I heard a long time ago that trump would get a sweet % of Rosnefts oil for the deal. Then he would truly be a billionaire oligarch

6120 2018-12-01 19:02:51 OK. I think everyone is online now. 

I sell beard oil. Really cheap, just 4k.  

You can get your own too with little or no stress. 

Just send a DM 
6121 2018-12-01 19:02:51 You put them in hot oil and BAM deep fry pics
6122 2018-12-01 19:02:51 What I remember about Bush was protesting his administration. No blood for oil, 90s style.
6123 2018-12-01 19:02:44 I have to look at my screen twice like "Oh, yeah, him" when my autocorrect changes his name to "First President elected by Big Oil".
6124 2018-12-01 19:02:43 You sure they still do? Because everything Google says is vegetable oil
6125 2018-12-01 19:02:39 Coconut oil + aloe Vera gel gets you right.
6126 2018-12-01 19:02:35 Would you like some essential oil?????
6127 2018-12-01 19:02:32 I agree Mother Earth is not pleased with what we've been doing to the only home we have *but* unless exacerbated by pulling oil out of her, earthquakes happen regardless of what we are doing to the air and water. Quakes preceded humans and will continue after we're gone.
6128 2018-12-01 19:02:27 I see it as the opposite as the yuan devalue unwinds massively (back to 6.6 in a week) dollar should crater to levels seen back in the spring. Market should also interpret a deal as bullish LNG and oil as US can offload inventory to China.
6129 2018-12-01 19:02:24 I like apple vinegar cider, olive oil my friend iceberg is swimming in drop of that dressing pool
6130 2018-12-01 19:02:20 Another way to undo Obama rules to profit off Big Oil for a year while committing crimes against marine humanity.
6131 2018-12-01 19:02:12 Par = part right? No oil in the oven?
6132 2018-12-01 19:02:10 And how to you pay for that diversity?
That’s right, oil and gas pal. Figure it out.
6133 2018-12-01 19:02:06 あいっ！
6134 2018-12-01 19:01:57 It is hilarious but also logical (if you are a criminal) bc the price per barrel is so much higher than oil. I think there’s a documentary too!
6135 2018-12-01 19:01:50 Oga wetin be your name let’s do background check Oga oil sheikh abi? Well I met Mr Stanley at a renowned media outfit in Lagos he was their creative director at that time..pls be polite oh to avoid 
6136 2018-12-01 19:01:49 I wish the keeper caught it.  But nah,  her village people came for her and it went wide.  

I recommend 21days dry fasting,  and a full bath with TB Joshua holy water and anointing oil.
6137 2018-12-01 19:01:47 Natural deLight
6138 2018-12-01 19:01:33 The Bush family are not good people Bush 41's father was selling oil to Hitler behind the American governments back, Bush 43 lie to the American people about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq when they found out Saddam Hussein didn't want petro-dollars, and many other lies
6139 2018-12-01 19:01:31 It’s not good but, fish oil
6140 2018-12-01 19:01:23 Season it again (rub oil in it every time you clean it then put it away. Absolutely never clean with soap.) Then after about 10-20 cookings it gets non-stick. Once it’s got that layer of seasoning it won’t stick, not even a lick!
6141 2018-12-01 19:01:16 No thank you is right, on our own behalf and on the behalf of the generations who will live in a world ravaged by climate change, caused by burning all that oil
6142 2018-12-01 19:01:10 First, all transport uses only 25 percent of the world's energy production.
Second, electric cars are at this stage limited by the failure to scale up output more than technical considerations. And even that's due to Big Oil's fighting them for so long.
6143 2018-12-01 19:01:04 Dumb question.  It's 15 years of Liberal government spending like drunken sailors, and a PM bent on destroying our oil industry.  But sure,  blame Doug Ford who's only been premier for less than 6 months!
6144 2018-12-01 19:01:02 No, this is not Lush’s fault.  They promote opening our minds to other options, not just oil and gas.  And it seems during the boom it was alright to do that.  They have had the one article up since 2012.  Why did you not call for a boycott then?
6145 2018-12-01 19:01:00 A drizzle of olive oil helps a little but the key ingredient for crispness is corn starch
6146 2018-12-01 19:00:48 I work throughout the Caribbean. There’s an oil terminal on Sint Eustasius and unlike the rest of the islands of the Caribbean it has instant deep water all around it. So any type of sea fairing vessel can come directly to it without any problems. This will come in handy soon.
6147 2018-12-01 19:00:28 That settles it. I am going to go back to oil painting. Hook ya boy up with a canvas, ye? ;3
6148 2018-12-01 19:00:28 “a double hull does not, in and of itself, prevent an oil spill from occurring.” “the single hull tankers with segregated ballast tanks actually performed better (had a lower total amount of spillage per ship year) than did either the double sided or double bottom tankers.”
6149 2018-12-01 19:00:25 Big data and the treatment of it is the new snake oil. Covered wagons all around, hawking wares from the back while twirling a mustache and hoping to move on to the next mark soon.

6151 2018-12-01 19:00:20 Ooh,, idk if it's technically a lipstick, but beauty bakeries lip line is amazing. It stays on with everything you eat or drink unless its superrrr oily food. The makeup comes off with oil based removers (or like coconut/olive oil). But like, that BB line is so good man
6152 2018-12-01 19:00:20 Oil
6153 2018-12-01 19:00:19 So I’ve heard 
6154 2018-12-01 19:00:05 So all of the CIA meddling, leader assassinating, country uprooting, oil stealing, election rigging, millions dying, ect.. didn't bother them at all? The religious aspect aside, you're being hypocritical.
6155 2018-12-01 19:00:04 I am glad that I’m getting paid for this oil change.
6156 2018-12-01 18:59:56 @BarackObama was right the Oil Boom started on his watch also Obama signed the 2015 bill that ended the ban on oil exports obama was pratical not extreme on energy policy @CNN @foxnews @msnbc @moveon @cnbc @WSJ @realDonaldTrump @dcexaminer
6157 2018-12-01 18:59:38 This hot oil treatment is about to feel like heaven 
6158 2018-12-01 18:59:32 Somehow your story is strangely reassuring & tragically confirming~ US is a functionally illiterate society. 1999 we allowed Pres Clinton/NATO to bomb Yugoslavia to pieces so they would be more like US. May the Children of Crazy Horse survive to rebuild US from ashes of Oil Wars~
6159 2018-12-01 18:59:25 No. Not all Americans mourn the death of an oil monger with US soldiers blood on his and Cheney's hands.
6160 2018-12-01 18:59:23 Not invalidating your wider point, but Obama had blocked the tar sands oil pipeline...
6161 2018-12-01 18:59:12 India Recovered it recently from 14% to 7% Because Crude oil prices went Down
6162 2018-12-01 18:59:02 Also explains his allegiance to fossil fuels, oppo to renewables. Oil in ground not worth much once we switch to solar, wind, etc.
6163 2018-12-01 18:59:01 Know the state? This is my state. A state that boost of Oluwaglass, Ceramic Industry, Okitipupa oil mill and we have nothing again and you're here with a rhetoric of if you know the state? Cut me some slack please.
6164 2018-12-01 18:58:52 What's the throat? Let Iran/SA fight and wave bye bye to China's oil supply lines?
6165 2018-12-01 18:58:29 I was talking about olive oil soap
6166 2018-12-01 18:58:12 Oil is a commodity - people buy it primarily for the energy it provides. The fact that Canadian oil is heavy (requiring more refining) is reflected in the typical discount of $15/barrel. At a discount of $40/barrel, the additional $25 is due to lack of transport capacity.
6167 2018-12-01 18:58:10 Okay, thanks for the help, ladies. Did you get your oil from the OCS, Diane? I'm thinking of getting some for my hubby. He has suffered with terrible insomnia for years! I don't think the cbd oil will be potent enough for himlololol he's gonna need something with more of a punch!
6168 2018-12-01 18:58:10 I've been following,  but not sure, did you toss in Rosneft oil somewhere, too, Seth?
6169 2018-12-01 18:58:06 It’s a simple fact that domesticated breeds would not survive in the wild. They wud starve or get sick. Animals should not be mistreated. I entirely agree with that. I don’t agree with ur belief that by being farmed they necessarily are. Do vegans use products made with palm oil?
6170 2018-12-01 18:58:04 Louisville and out of bounds plays. Oil and water.

6174 2018-12-01 18:57:57 And BH are not your brothers... Yet no one accuses you of that.... Can u guys for once talk with sense?
6175 2018-12-01 18:57:55 Well, people have been looking for such factors for ages and not found anything that accounts for such change. Eg the sun gets examined minutely for sunspots and their influence, that's just routine. And I don't just mean CO2 from oil etc. You've got to consider, deforestation,
6176 2018-12-01 18:57:47 Gotta go change my oil .. ughhhh
6177 2018-12-01 18:57:44 That would be great! You need 10 kilos for 1 liter. I'd have lots of oil in no time.

6180 2018-12-01 18:57:19 Never agreed with his policies. The foreign policy at the time was pretty shitty. War for oil was a big part of creating many problems in the future of the Middle East. As a person he was ok and had some dignity. Something  we are sorely missing now in that office.
6181 2018-12-01 18:57:16 お気をつけて！！
6182 2018-12-01 18:57:16 Ugh when the movie theater uses butter instead of olive oil in their popcorn  we didn’t buy any but we are supper disappointed
6183 2018-12-01 18:57:14 Why do people feel the need to have personal conversations, extremely loudly and with obnoxious laughs, in waiting rooms? Like, waiting an hour for my oil change already blows and I’d literally rather pull out my own teeth than listen to you on top of it.
6184 2018-12-01 18:57:10 if instead of blood you had oil in your veins, would you blush black
6185 2018-12-01 18:56:49 Ha ha ha ha... Oil prices are SMASHED... they’re local economies feeling the blow... how are they more powerful?
6186 2018-12-01 18:56:34 Or men  cause its the same song ...like in Nevada you can buy it but can't medicate or some stupid shit like that or you can have oil and edibles but no flowers  WTFIT? Bullshit is what it is you fight you vote even when you win you lose like in Florida last yr smh,
6187 2018-12-01 18:56:31 This event also makes it clear that there must be powerful forces at work preventing our "advanced" nation from having safe, inexpensive, high-speed mass transit systems in all major cities and linking up the entire country. We could have had this years ago! Big oil, once again!
6188 2018-12-01 18:55:56 lmfao these clowns at the oil change are fuckin with me rn 
6189 2018-12-01 18:55:56 Pour motor oil on pancakes and ALL.
6190 2018-12-01 18:55:51 1. You know what's funny? You don't know a one thing you are talking about. at all. I worked in the ME for years and every single national oil company (Iraq, Kuwait) did not have the ability or technology to save their oil fields or develop them further, MANY countries, Russia
6191 2018-12-01 18:55:47 will the stretch marks fade with regular almond oil application? I'll show myself out
6192 2018-12-01 18:55:38 Ppl like “what’s your skincare routine”... for 1: I use 2 separate wash cloths (face and body wash cloth). 2, drink MAD water, keep ur body alkaline (7.0 pH), rose water, no oil on face (just aloe and occasional shea butter) , bentonite clay mask, and don’t drink pop!!
6193 2018-12-01 18:55:21 From a global perspective why would anyone want dirty Cdn oil with all its environmental challenges when there is so much cleaner oil available elsewhere?
6194 2018-12-01 18:55:11 Only Norway has oil though there are strong social safety nets in all Scandinavian countries. It has more to do with a culture that emphasizes egalitarian values.
6195 2018-12-01 18:55:00 I don't think you should oil your baby.

6208 2018-12-01 18:53:00 American Energy is being produced with more consideration of environmental impacts and mitigation to address those impacts than ever before.

6210 2018-12-01 18:52:35 Got my moms present , my lil bro shoes on the way , bills paid , oil change & a new filter on my car , my bundles on its way , brows & lashes done  i feel accomplished today !
6211 2018-12-01 18:52:31 U had better do something cause we were just coming out of this recession & it looks like we will be going right back into it again cause of a lack of pipelines!! We have to get our oil & gas to other markets!! Otherwise Alberta will DIE!!!
6212 2018-12-01 18:52:30 Probably because humans need to eat but don't need oil. So we'll deal with the fossil fuels first, yeah?
6213 2018-12-01 18:52:27 Really enjoying @FitCrunchBars from @RobertIrvine, but noticed Palm Oil is a major ingredient. When I scanned the barcode on @CheyenneMtnZoo’s Palm Oil app nothing came up. I really hope it’s sourced the right way.

6217 2018-12-01 18:52:11 Clearly not !  It is the yellow of the vest that every french must have in their car. It's a protest against taxes that the gov expand to oil.

6221 2018-12-01 18:51:32 he tlkn bout domestically produced oil. but of course that had alot to do w/ them fucking over the Native Americans out of their land for pipelines. thats Obamas title & he owning that shit smh
6222 2018-12-01 18:51:15 When you give up all that the oil and gas industry has provided for you then I will consider respecting your cause. Until then just consider yourself a hypocrite and shut the heck up.
6223 2018-12-01 18:50:56 Do nottttt feel like getting an oil change.
6224 2018-12-01 18:50:49 Sis, weka some karafuu in olive oil, warm it up and then dip a cotton wool in it and then dab the tooth or area with the cotton wool. Repeat often
6225 2018-12-01 18:50:46 OK a bit of tea tree oil in the charcoal?
6226 2018-12-01 18:50:44 Shell oil
6227 2018-12-01 18:50:42 Completely agree, not even a proper “excuse” there... it’s what makes money, and currently it’s the “fight against palm oil” as well as bird corpses ... 
6228 2018-12-01 18:50:24 Spent my entire career (50 years) in construction!  A hell of a lot more ups and downs than the oil business(and way less pay) quit whining!
6229 2018-12-01 18:50:23 As a proud Canadian, I won’t shop at @lushcosmetics for bashing our fair trade, clean tech oil and gas sector as part of a PR stunt for the non-Canadian campaign to block our exports. 
6230 2018-12-01 18:50:20 Looks like the peppermint oil is having none of it.
6231 2018-12-01 18:50:20 that's not oil

6234 2018-12-01 18:50:15 Socialist, as in Norway. Not Venezuela. Look up what Norway has done with their oil starting in the 70s. If we had done the same thing then we would be ALL be well off. Instead we just have a few really rich people.
6235 2018-12-01 18:50:14 oil
6236 2018-12-01 18:50:12 I don’t recommend , it tastes like oil
6237 2018-12-01 18:50:10 “The way united are going down they’ll soon discover crude oil” the British truly know how to insult in style
6238 2018-12-01 18:50:09 @rhettmc Mythical Beard Oil is the first beard oil I actually look forward to applying and doesn't leave my beard feeling greasy. Great quality, even better smell. But I gotta ask... when can we get some Mythical Beard Balm?? #LetsTalkAboutThat

6242 2018-12-01 18:49:32 Nope
Venezuela fell apart because of the oil export.
When oil prices crashed its economy crashed.
Not socialism
Because of their economic crashed their people became hungry.
Trump is depending on oil exports the same way Venezuela did and if oil prices crashed again the same...
6243 2018-12-01 18:49:26 Doubt the discussion was about murder vs the likely hiking of oil prices in a few weeks. That would hurt macron more! #FreedomOfThePress
6244 2018-12-01 18:49:10 I got a haircut and now im waiting on my car to finish this fuck ass oil change. That’s enough adulting for today. I deserve an hour of throat after all this.
6245 2018-12-01 18:49:04 Y’all know how I always said fuck an oil change? Yeah my car won’t start up now I’ll start listening to my dad I swear

6247 2018-12-01 18:48:54 Yes, I am. I’m well aware we aren’t anywhere near complete green energy in Canada or the world. And I’m aware that the billions in profit and royalties from oil sands will enable R&D and fund infrastructure transition to green energy here and elsewhere.
6248 2018-12-01 18:48:53 Supposedly spot treatment dulu but i rasa it also depends on how u like it to be? Haha i personally tak suka letak ubat jerawat dulu especially if guna teatree oil nanti i sapu moisturiser terspread everything kat all over my face.. ni cara i fikir laa hahaha
6249 2018-12-01 18:48:48 Dude I literally always go to get my oil change from this guy and he uses his own oil he buys. Washes my Windows and vacuums out my car and still only charges me 25. Sometimes he'll just say don't worry about it.
6250 2018-12-01 18:48:42 Too much oil
6251 2018-12-01 18:48:29 This man legit just spent $90 to send his sister some flowers and a stuffed animal because she’s mad at him....

My brother is a mechanic and I can’t even get a discount on an oil change....smh
6252 2018-12-01 18:48:27 That would be legit and then I’d have something to get me through waiting for my oil change haha
6253 2018-12-01 18:48:16 I've said above.  Production cuts will increase everyone's revenue while we wait for pipelines.  If we don't, there is a real risk this whole sector goes bust.

Oil companies have been working hard for a decade and the federal government keeps screwing it up.

6255 2018-12-01 18:47:44 Maybe extracting oil from tar sands is inherently harmful to the environment just like burning them is. We need to aim to kick the habit.
6256 2018-12-01 18:47:37 I thought my hairdresser cared about me but she’s letting jojoba oil pour all over my coat :(
6257 2018-12-01 18:47:35 They think it's a great idea to protest for cheaper oil as if the world is not fucked enough but this diety shit already. Fools.
6258 2018-12-01 18:47:26 He was pretty scary actually as a president, think WMD.    I commend him for building a coalition to push Iraq out of Kuwait, but he kept going and took over the country for cheap oil, then there as Cheney...    we called them “neo-cons”  but I’ll follow you.....
6259 2018-12-01 18:47:24 Did it ever occur to you that the unwillingness of the PCs to moderate the boom/bust cycle in the oil patch is what drove that spend upwards?  Literally, it happened because you couldn't hire teachers in YYC or YEG for what they were paying them in Regina ...

6263 2018-12-01 18:46:57 Sane people thought Syncrude was crazy, in 1968, to develop tarsands but ever since they convinced successive govts to pump in taxpayer money and forgo royalties. Now, tar oil is worthless with Peak Oil and overflowing sweet crude. It’s a dead investment.

6282 2018-12-01 18:45:40 Agreed, товарищ.

In all seriousness, comparing an internet service and a business that drills for oil is apples and oranges. Google's freedom as a business is intertwined with freedom of information itself, that of oil monopolies in 1911 was not.

6300 2018-12-01 18:43:57 Disingenuous to paint it this way - many protestors feel strangled by taxes, not “raising oil prices”.
6301 2018-12-01 18:43:24 motivating canadians to build and buy electric vehicles is an excellent way to divest ourselves from saudi arabia. we can generate our own auto fuel for EVs, for far cheaper than dirty (tar sands) and bloodsoaked (saudi) oil.

6305 2018-12-01 18:42:45 I honestly believe there is a good possibility US production will hit 11Mbpd before it hits 12Mbpd. If oil heads from $50 to $55 in the next 2 wks then I'm wrong and they will hit 12 first. The pace of growth is going to disappoint in 2019. This drop scared them. Budgets falling

6310 2018-12-01 18:41:42 4) When discussing electric vehicles, people make the category mistake of assigning electricity to the category of oil, coal & nuclear energy. Electric cars are subsequently labeled as ‘clean’. Electricity is derived (from coal, nuclear, etc.) & is not a primary source of energy.

6346 2018-12-01 18:38:11 BTW, you know they staged this spontaneous jesture just to stick it to @realDonaldTrump ? This was like an end zone dance. The two other oil moguls kept us out of Paris (giving oil a lifeline), selling them arms, and free passes to kill journalists. Hat Trick!
6347 2018-12-01 18:38:07 I use olive oil
6348 2018-12-01 18:38:06 He also was an oil baron
6349 2018-12-01 18:38:02 Die for oil sucker.
6350 2018-12-01 18:37:54 Bros take am 
Oil Dey your head
6351 2018-12-01 18:37:50 Of what!!! 80% Americans believe that climate changing and we all need to act now!!! Not support oil and coal billionaires!!!!
6352 2018-12-01 18:37:33 Blue dream Pineapple Express oil
6353 2018-12-01 18:37:33 somewhere in his closet, there's an oil painting of lou dobbs that is turning to liquid shit and it's aging at the exact same rate he is
6354 2018-12-01 18:37:30 OF COURSE IT RAINS WHEN IM TRYING TO CHANGE MY OWN OIL
6355 2018-12-01 18:37:19 Labzakh you are on fire man, but due to the presence of oil on that thread, I will not translate it.
6356 2018-12-01 18:37:15 Lol I no fit marry them abeg 
6357 2018-12-01 18:37:12 That and baiting Iraq into a war which then led to at least three more wars and disguising it as humanitarian help for Kuwait instead of a bid to control vast oil reserves.
6358 2018-12-01 18:37:04 Interesting interaction with Zionist activists today in Glasgow. A sage of them cited the ‘giving back’ of Sinai as how reasonable The Israeli State was. When he denied there were considerable oil and gas reserves in the occupied Golan Heights I said the conversation was ended.
6359 2018-12-01 18:37:01 Took an oil bath last night. I’m so soft and smooth
6360 2018-12-01 18:37:01 Did you see @jkenney saying he’s going raise oil prices himself . The market sets the price you fool.
6361 2018-12-01 18:36:54 WE KEEP IN TOUCH.WE DRINK OIL  SO WE DON T HAVE TO FEAR X-RAYS AND ODDS. WE KEEP REPELLANT
6362 2018-12-01 18:36:47 Problem is the Americans don't want our oil to tidewater, cause then they will have to start paying us what it is worth instead of ripping us off as they have ALWAYS done with the Canadian governments help. They use OUR resource to bargain for everything with the US. #Treacherous
6363 2018-12-01 18:36:46 Yeah, that's the issue. You need at least some olive oil, salt wouldn't go amiss either (bit of pepper too)
6364 2018-12-01 18:36:44 Yeah I was talking about like essential oil rose that gets added for fragrance or a “fragrance” that’s made up of 100s of chemicals that are unlisted because it’s the compounds of the “fragrance” ugh that’s completely different topic but it made me think, if it’s not a rose oil
6365 2018-12-01 18:36:43 OIL
6366 2018-12-01 18:36:37 Who Tf scrambles eggs in olive oil obfn  I can't trust you
6367 2018-12-01 18:36:23 Great question: Regulations vary based on size and how cooking oil is used but every District restaurant is required to know the regulations & follow them - usually grease and cooking oil must be collected on site and safely disposed of to protect our infrastructure 
6368 2018-12-01 18:36:21 If we strapped a barrel of oil to every temporary foreign worker you allowed to become a citizen, then made them swim home, would we get fair market value?
6369 2018-12-01 18:36:16 So. You would rather the oil be transported via transport truck and thier carbon producing engines?
6370 2018-12-01 18:36:16 This spells doom, unemployment rise and quite possibly a bailout. It’s just pathetic that time after time, a lot of shocks appear after oil price slump.
6371 2018-12-01 18:35:48 Kuwait was STEALING OIL from Iraq. They were warned.
6372 2018-12-01 18:35:27 Deve usare oil of volaz.. sto impunito
6373 2018-12-01 18:35:25 definitely lavender. I use it for almost everything. 
I use the dried flowers to smoke, bake, I burn it w/ sage & cedar to cleanse, infuse it in oils/ my own holy water mix.
i use the oil for baths, aromatherapy, and sometimes to make perfumes. 
& i may get a tat of the flower
6374 2018-12-01 18:35:23 Supposedly it’s because we have all this excess screwed from American manufacturing. And all the new oil Found him other parts of the world. 10 years ago they were saying that we’re going to run out of oil by 2020
6375 2018-12-01 18:35:20 Turn of the century factories had 4"x 4"x6" Doug fir turned on end first for sound then for comfort. I disassembled one and installed it in a residential. Cut 1/4" of the end which revealed oil and rust stains. It was stunning.
6376 2018-12-01 18:35:19 these tweets inspired me to finally get some Argan oil thank u
6377 2018-12-01 18:35:14 Don't for get the oil patch and AG industries he is killing with his empty head.
6378 2018-12-01 18:35:01 Is ehllinger covered in oil or what?
6379 2018-12-01 18:35:00 Oil
6380 2018-12-01 18:34:54 cooking oil, charcoal,match box/stick
6381 2018-12-01 18:34:51 getting my oil changed (yay go me for adulting) at the sketchiest place in myrtle beach. when i get abducted & murdered, be sure to tell my cats i love them.
6382 2018-12-01 18:34:40 Hunting in VA? You getting your limit on buffleheads? Or see anything fun out there? (Cc: @Archer_Jeffries )
6383 2018-12-01 18:34:35 My favorite dumb bitch moment of mine was in hs when I worked at my aunt and uncles deli and I put a bottle of oil DIRECTLY on a blazing hot grill and then WALKED AWAY. my uncle SPRINTS over to the MELTING bottle with oil splattering EVERYWHERE. All I said to him was “wow idk”
6384 2018-12-01 18:34:34 do you think high oil prices also lead to tight bias?
6385 2018-12-01 18:34:29 Aye and peppermint foot scrub  See that? A load of some West African root mashed to a pulp, coconut oil, essence oils, whisk it up and leave for a month in a bottle. Or just go to fucking Boots and buy it for a couple of quid  #KirstiesHandmadeChristmas
6386 2018-12-01 18:34:24 Not that big of a deal. Great team.  Great work. Just never been a 10 minute oil change.
6387 2018-12-01 18:34:19 @mazdacanada do you like it when you try to push gas cars and all you hear is people telling you their next car will be electric?  Is it inertia or big oil preventing you from making the switch?  Well, if you resist electrification, enjoy your Kodak moment!
6388 2018-12-01 18:34:19 うろむさんえっちだね。ふーんえっちじゃん？
6389 2018-12-01 18:34:12 ok ok i'm good, haven't paid yet but i got the email and i feel reassured

NOW FOR THAT OIL CHANGE LOLOLOL
6390 2018-12-01 18:34:06 Please who knows where I can get original castor oil ?
6391 2018-12-01 18:34:05 What is your point? This also counts for the diesel oil: it was taxed on the national level.
6392 2018-12-01 18:34:04 Yes. But it's only supposed to be external. The manufacturer didn't cap the ends before painting. Broke an $800 incert because they didn't. And ruined about $2,000 worth of oil.
6393 2018-12-01 18:34:03 The chamber that holds the oil or dry herb screws on top. Let me know if you have more questions.
6394 2018-12-01 18:34:00 Look back what the UN did on Cambodia mission where they used their own $10 billion. How about KofiAnnan’s son Kojo bribery case on Iraq oil for food? The UN is Hippopotamus in NYC zoo big mouth to eat and small anus to dedicate;)
6395 2018-12-01 18:34:00 He was a decorated Navy pilot, successful oil executive, congressman, United Nations delegate, Republican Party chairman, envoy to Beijing and director of Central Intelligence. He was a patriot and dedicated public servant. I can respect that, even if he was a Republican.

6397 2018-12-01 18:33:52 The olive oil one she mentioned is bomb used it a couple days ago hair feel brand new
6398 2018-12-01 18:33:52 Some may call it petty, but remember Donald calls the Prime Minister "Justin." The Canadians know how to burn. Plus, Canada is the biggest source, by far, for US oil imports. Just sayin'
6399 2018-12-01 18:33:51 Learned how to change my oil today 
6400 2018-12-01 18:33:49 No solo era el socio sino que era la cara visible de OIL, y de paso le recuerdo que no aporto las cagas sociales de sus empleados en Ideas y se quedo con la plata de dichos descuentos igual que Cristobal. No se por que esta suelto este.

6403 2018-12-01 18:33:34 New oil, who dis?
6404 2018-12-01 18:33:32 Judgement's coming like a freight train. All the warning lights are flashing; all the sirens are screaming. The deserts are blooming and the Dead Sea is springing to life. 

The Bridegroom is coming! Do you have oil in your lamp??
6405 2018-12-01 18:33:31 We struggle because the Tories sold our oil cheap to the US for favours, would not take it to tidewater with new pipelines and would not hold those stealing our resources responsible for the environmental damages they have caused. For them to cry foul is an OUTRAGE! #IRememberYou
6406 2018-12-01 18:33:27 แถวไหนคับให้เลย
6407 2018-12-01 18:33:27 You are a DANGEROUS snake oil salesman.
6408 2018-12-01 18:33:20 When did giving the gov't more money solve problems? Alberta's gov't needs to radically improve the tax and investment environment so we diversify the economy ASAP. Not bail out oil dinosaurs who didn't have the foresight to build refineries for bitumen.
6409 2018-12-01 18:33:19 Oil change, new tires & new brakes day 
6410 2018-12-01 18:33:18 Now that we know he is their puppet man; my prediction is that the puppet will soon do something to force the price of oil up ...like a war on Iran.
6411 2018-12-01 18:33:16 มี
6412 2018-12-01 18:33:13 and for those in the tropics Palm and coconut oil.
6413 2018-12-01 18:33:01 To be fair,the oil industry is a beast that slowly kills itself and everything around it.
 At some point it is better to put the beast down and look for alternative sources of first,even if it means many lean years after the slaughter.
Must be done.
6414 2018-12-01 18:33:01 Blows my mind all the lefties giving Bush Sr so many props. I remember in 90/91when he was a piece of shit that got a lot of people killed for some Kuwaiti oil. 
6415 2018-12-01 18:32:55 Awesome.  

Been saying it for years. 
Many of my Nfld brethren left families, homes to work in uncharted territory of oil rigs in middle of nowhere in minus 40 degrees so  could have cheap oil from our ethical country. All were grateful. 

We owe Alberta a mountain of debt.
6416 2018-12-01 18:32:53 That is why an oil spike is coming. MbS and Putin shook hands like bros. Neither of them are going to be fooled by Trump ever again. The shale drillers also know Trump is no longer a friend. If they cut production they will stay in defensive mode. Trump won't protect them.
6417 2018-12-01 18:32:52 The difference between a depression day and a feeling a bit better - did the kitty watching, visited mom, oil change, grocery shopping.

A friend wants me to visit and paint with her.  That I am feeling meh about.  

Maybe better for after work one day.
6418 2018-12-01 18:32:50 We put Hussein in power! If US oil  has no deals in Kuwait do we intervene? Similar to Shell and Vietnam. Cmon its always about the oil. Maybe we should stop overthrowing world leaders and replacing them with “our” guys! Howd Noriega, Hussein and Castro turn out?
6419 2018-12-01 18:32:43 Look back what the UN did on Cambodia mission where they used their own $10 billion. How about KofiAnnan’s son Kojo bribery case on Iraq oil for food? The UN is Hippopotamus in NYC zoo big mouth to eat and small anus to dedicate;)
6420 2018-12-01 18:32:41 Why is the Alberta government buying rail cars to ship oil? Oil companies make BILLIONS (with a B), do we really need to give them such a free ride? If I own a company, I have to pay to ship my products to customers. Dumb. Buy your own damn trains. #AbLeg
6421 2018-12-01 18:32:39 What did your government do?  Need to diversify as Alberta is a whim of the economic tides of Oil Prices

6427 2018-12-01 18:31:57 Getting an oil change right now. Pretty excited for them to tell me all the things wrong with my car so I can nod knowingly and then refuse to do anything about it ever at all
6428 2018-12-01 18:31:35 Oil of oregano is a go to for any infection. Lugol's iodine, too.
6429 2018-12-01 18:31:31 Snake oil salesman. These lefties always fall for the sweet talk.  Bill must have felt lonely in the Oval Office,  that's why he invited Monica under the desk.
6430 2018-12-01 18:31:16 You'd need to check the lock capacity along the route. Most oil tankers are sized for Panama and Suez canal locks. If our locks are smaller, the ships won't fit.
6431 2018-12-01 18:31:08 Oh just wait. Shadow of Maduro / Chavez will be ubiquitous throughout AMLO's term. World's largest oil deposits & now one of its biggest consumption markets under Havana's spell. Not bad for a small Caribbean island!
6432 2018-12-01 18:31:07 ah okay that's a shame. do you do any other leave in conditioner sprays as opposed to an oil?
6433 2018-12-01 18:31:02 The one thing I've never understood is why the team gets credit for guys who workout on PTO. Let's not kid ourselves, all the credit should go to the players. They are the ones who earn the spot

6443 2018-12-01 18:29:58 I don’t know about oil.  Never tried it.  

And have tried and don’t like edibles.  

I smoke.   ( post 1/2)

6445 2018-12-01 18:29:54 So I made this wonderful Lebanese garlic sauce yesterday. I’m gonna grill some meat, fish and veg and see if it’s hitting on anything. 

It’s literally a shit load of garlic, lemon juice and oil and you emulsify it until it’s the consistency of mayo.
6446 2018-12-01 18:29:47 I literally had a dream about checking the oil in my car..
6447 2018-12-01 18:29:40 I do not believe these people distrust the scientific evidence. I believe they only claim they don't but they do but they chose to defend the oil and gas sector at all cost. They know their industry is destroying the planet but they will never acknowledge it publicly.
6448 2018-12-01 18:29:38 Word to the wise: don’t ever use coconut oil to grease a cake pan. #fail
6449 2018-12-01 18:29:36 @RachelNotley here’s a thought for the oil rollercoaster - rapid transition to green economy, wind, solar, geothermal, batteries, solar panels, modular homes.

6450 2018-12-01 18:29:30 A drop of oil worths more than a drop of blood.
6451 2018-12-01 18:29:29 [Barbara and Georg H.W. Bush in a giant cauldron of boiling oil in Hell]: OH GOD. WE DIDNT THINK THIS PLACE WAS REAL. WHAT HAVE WE DONE. IS THIS FOREVER?? OH GOD
[the Devil while gleefully stabbing them with a pitchfork]: MUAHAHAHAHAHAH
6452 2018-12-01 18:29:22 #DarkTale > What all these ignorant pro-oil Albertans #dontgetit is that there's simply no time for an easy& gradual transition to a green-economy. The oil, auto & air industries must be shut down completely. Today would be great; IF you want a livable planet for your children 
6453 2018-12-01 18:29:20 Trump and Big Coal/Oil/Energy are the real eco-terrorists.
6454 2018-12-01 18:29:15 You get my point. Just because Scotty did it also doesn’t mean he copied Toulon. The Livery was originated in 1970 by a designer for Gulf oil company and has been repeated numerous times since. Can’t point a finger at somebody for copying you when you have already copied somebody
6455 2018-12-01 18:29:09 "oil is booming everywhere else EXCEPT canada."
Global oil prices have lost a third of their value in the last 2 months because of excess global supply. That's partly why the differential has grown.

"alberta has diversified"
Not really.
6456 2018-12-01 18:29:08 You're saying people are wrong based on the price move. That's wrong. From May until Nov 5th, everyone was supposed to be bullish. Our F'ing POS President is the problem, not Saudis, not Russia and not oil traders. $76 WTI was a reasonable price knowing Iran exports were "cut".
6457 2018-12-01 18:28:52 Donc son ras le bol c'est pour le fuel et le gas oil on a les combats qu'on mérite
6458 2018-12-01 18:28:51 we are already way beyond oil...

6466 2018-12-01 18:28:10 omg looks like a marilyn minter oil painting!
6467 2018-12-01 18:28:06 You'll have to ask Tom about that.
My interpretation is he's highlighting a weakness in the way US universities teach political science. The idea that national security grads lack a basic understanding of oil markets (which in my experience is true) is borderline malpractice
6468 2018-12-01 18:28:05 @RepJaredPolis @SenBennetCO @SenCoryGardner: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast
6469 2018-12-01 18:28:04 Trump got tagged teamed. The consummate con artist got outplayed in his own game.

Also, it’s humiliating when he knows he’s being laughed at by people he otherwise respects (an KGB spy- turned-oligarch and an oil Prince of a land that is also the center seat of a major faith.)
6470 2018-12-01 18:28:04 Well.. We only had the worst month for oil in 10 years in November. For sure the balancing act was very poorly done this time.
6471 2018-12-01 18:27:52 oil of every Pearl's whatever is just a weak album overall. vocals, instrumentation, everything were really poorly done to me. it didnt deserve the massive attention it got

6475 2018-12-01 18:27:39 I've been drinking a smoothie of:
fresh ginger
fresh curcuma 
banana/apple
and some drops of hemp oil to help with the curcuma absorption every morning.
Is there something else I should add to make it even more nutritional  or beneficial?
6476 2018-12-01 18:27:36 Oil for food...the story how UN fukked Iraq ... but you dont want to hear that right?
6477 2018-12-01 18:27:32 Not trying to spill any tea but Yang has created more sexual and romantic tension with Blake in 6 episodes then Sun has in 2 seasons
6478 2018-12-01 18:27:29 2016 was a turf war for market share. They tried to stop our mega-projects (success) and shale drillers (completely failure) and lost their asses in the process. They are not going to repeat 2016. Shale can have their market share. It's crappy low quality oil anyways.
6479 2018-12-01 18:27:24 Hard to see new highs in the stock market now. People want to exit in any bounce. But that is another story. I care about oil now.
6480 2018-12-01 18:27:10 The facts are we need oil and gas to maintain our standard of living. She just wants more big, useless government control that will do nothing but make our lives worse, put hundreds of thousands out of work, and increase our deficit by billions.
6481 2018-12-01 18:27:08 아니 어떻게 1연 쓰알이 나오죠????? 진짜???
6482 2018-12-01 18:27:00 Yeah, but you tweeted directly at mine so point taken.  Sports and integrity is like oil and water.
6483 2018-12-01 18:26:57 The crude oil price per barrel in 2014 was USD 98, which has drastically reduced in 2018 to USD 73.68, a reduction of 25.49%. But, petrol price in India has correspondingly increased from Rs.71 in May 2014 to Rs.75 in 2018 . We have to compare petrol price wrt crude oil price.
6484 2018-12-01 18:26:55 Yes, which then the fracking of oil contributes to fueling which then leads to emissions and ultimately climate change!
6485 2018-12-01 18:26:53 It's always easy when in a new environment. Most coaches tend to be far less interesting in year two and beyond. With that said, Hitch has always been great with the media & knows how to keep them off his back. He's no dummy.
6486 2018-12-01 18:26:48 Pata nhi amla ka mujhe sahi nhi laga aur caster oil baloon pr nhi laga ty palkoon pr woh thora sa lagya jata hAi
6487 2018-12-01 18:26:44 Rushing, rushing, rushing, just manage to sit in front of my pc after 1 week long injury..... burn the midnight oil
6488 2018-12-01 18:26:40 People are waking up to the #ClimateChange hoax.  If you want to make the masses poor, cold, hungry and too weak to fight back against the globalist demons, demonize oil, make it too expensive, spread lies and fear about the earth burning up. Indoctrinate the children.
6489 2018-12-01 18:26:37 Wait a minute!!!!! What if the oil and pipeline companies hired the returning isis members!!!! Then all those remote communities would be safe from the horrible raping Canadian workers!!! That should get pipe into the ground!!! Alert the media!!
6490 2018-12-01 18:26:32 Good! Then we can use oil money to buy the league like man city did
6491 2018-12-01 18:26:29 Bush wasn't all the great! Give me a break! Just because he was a successful oil tycoon doesn't mean he was a "great" President! He had his screw ups just like his son and Obummer!
6492 2018-12-01 18:26:23 Thats what I make, although sometimes I use orange oil
6493 2018-12-01 18:26:22 I am confused, I thought that the #ParisAgreement was such a good thing, everyone wanted to pay super high taxes for fuel oil. Then why is #FranceProtest happening?
6494 2018-12-01 18:26:22 Seems Don Jr and Eric haven’t killed enough animals to suit their Great White (Orange) Hunter daddy. Now #Trump  wants to kill millions of dolphins, whales and other ocean life (& help his oil & gas buddies get richer)with #SeismicBlasting off the Atlantic Coast. #SavetheWhales
6495 2018-12-01 18:26:20 Generally a good man BUT had oil interests in Kuwait which led his Son GWB to hit Iraq with an unjustified attack on Iraq & cut our upper brackets that began our Debt crises. I’m certainly not in Favor of Trumps plan to make him a National Holiday.  A DECENT MAN but?
6496 2018-12-01 18:26:19 Not sure about that but he did start the Gulf war and got that oil!
6497 2018-12-01 18:26:14 Every “axis of evil”in our times, goes directly to that man. Saudi oil partnership that funded terrorism, Chinese trade deficit and growing threat, drug cartels in Central and South America, the rise of globalist control, the economic export of our prosperity, etc., etc.
6498 2018-12-01 18:26:06 influence...oil...whatever.
6499 2018-12-01 18:26:04 By going nucleur- Apart from solving climate issues like CO2-Would also add to world peace by reducing greatly  revenue for major oil producing nations that R major players in  wars- civil wars proxy wars & their  spread of global terrorism & religion.
6500 2018-12-01 18:26:02 There is a 14 day notice period after the Agm if approved, we should be well in the oil by then.
6501 2018-12-01 18:25:59 and motor oil
6502 2018-12-01 18:25:57 Like having a car and putting gas in it and getting an oil change like car why you need so much?
6503 2018-12-01 18:25:57 One of your ""heavyweights" Mick.
You can't mix oil and water and the slimy Chuka is oilier than most.
6504 2018-12-01 18:25:49 OMGosh!!!! Best pizza we’ve had in NC! I had the "Frozen Pond" pizza with a olive oil and garlic crust... soooo good!! We also had the pretzel bites that were yum and best of all our waitress was Natasha and she was awesome!! Definitely will be back!!
6505 2018-12-01 18:25:42 จอยหัวควย
6506 2018-12-01 18:25:40 How do you expect the industries to respond. They need oil and gas to operate. Perhaps the best way is to shutdown the industry just save on co2 emissions. My bad. That's already happening. Good job Justin.
6507 2018-12-01 18:25:39 I hope it’s okay to agree to disagree. I don’t and didn’t have a problem with President Bush because he was a republican, but because of Desert Storm.  I still have a problem with Bush urging my other country to become involved and ultimately our soldiers dying in the name of oil

6509 2018-12-01 18:25:34 In the late 50’s my town in SE Sask was inundated with oil workers when the industry took off. There were a number of very serious incidents involving girls including criminal incidents. Quit mocking it Kenney. It does happen!!
6510 2018-12-01 18:25:33 Seconded! Cannabis oil is a major component to my herbal formulation for seizure intervention and prevention!
6511 2018-12-01 18:25:29 Love burning oils man. Anybody got a favorite oil they like to burn? I looove patchouli

6514 2018-12-01 18:25:20 I love it. Especially if I know what I'm looking for and seeing what looks good. Chat with the butcher, checkers, etc. I also like Costco.  Great for butter and olive oil, etc. You are not alone cook it girl.
6515 2018-12-01 18:25:16 And you guys being cunts tbh. We need to be able to get it to an ocean to get fair market price, we also aren’t even self sufficient, the east buys saudi, African, American etc oil. They won’t build a line from the west to supply them,they tanker it in lol it’s sick really
6516 2018-12-01 18:25:01 Time to stop “discussions” & make a decision already! The AER/govt is to protect the resources that belong to AB. Simply: 1-cut oil production so all companies make $; 2-cut transfer payments to protect AB! Do it now! Not tomoro! #takeaction
6517 2018-12-01 18:25:00 @lipton @Unilever, you changed the ingredients to "Recipe Secrets" Onion soup and dip mix! Sunflowers are deadly to me, as is their oil. I'm suffering a reaction to your soup mix RIGHT NOW which has never caused issues before. Such changes should be announced!
6518 2018-12-01 18:24:59 Until your baby pour oil on the chair. Your eye go clear.
6519 2018-12-01 18:24:50 Yes, which then the fracking of oil contributes to fueling which then leads to emissions and ultimately climate change!
6520 2018-12-01 18:24:34 You know what's up na
6521 2018-12-01 18:24:27 And I had moved from London to Edinburgh the year before.  The winter of 1962 was vicious.  I was pregnant and we had an oil heater which belched out smoke all through our new house.  Ended up in hospital for bed rest because of high b p.  So it would have been the same anywhere.
6522 2018-12-01 18:24:24 DT needs to give comfort to Iran by confirming USA will never try to nick oil in Iran.
6523 2018-12-01 18:24:16 See if your local hippie grocery has clove oil.   That may help.
6524 2018-12-01 18:24:15 I love coconut oil
6525 2018-12-01 18:24:04 Stop calling for a second referendum u bell end we voted leave we will leave dick head you took us to war over oil you have no say many families lost loved 1s because of you
6526 2018-12-01 18:24:01 I used mustard oil. But really both oil works fine. White oil is healthier.
And I used the packet garam masala powder that includes cloves loung dalchini elaichi and such
6527 2018-12-01 18:23:53 슬슬잘까?
6528 2018-12-01 18:23:52 Jiffy lube tryna finesse me. all I need is a simple oil change.
6529 2018-12-01 18:23:38 The fact that there's such a huge difference between the price for Cdn oil exports and the world oil price indicates that there's a glut of *Canadian* oil - there isn't enough transport capacity to get it to customers. I agree that in the long term, global oil demand will drop.
6530 2018-12-01 18:23:18 The girl in the orange ste, looks like Olive oil 
6531 2018-12-01 18:23:09 Gulf War.  Was all about oil.  Although oil is important, imho not enough to justify war.
6532 2018-12-01 18:23:07 CBD oils are the new essential oils. It’s all a sham to make money because it’s new and edgy because it’s hemp and by extension, weed or something. My advice: think of CBD oil as snake oils. Snake oils you can buy and bury in the ground and grow a giant beanstalk.

6534 2018-12-01 18:22:54 I was just pulling from Meg Jacobs’s *Panic at the Pump* last week for lecture and was reminded how the she frames the story around GHWB, as he represented both turn towards dereg in Repub Party but also as he stood in for domestic oil producers.
6535 2018-12-01 18:22:47 I was too lazy to put air in my tire so I finally took it to get an oil change so they could do it 
6536 2018-12-01 18:22:34 Simvastatins really the only statin patients bother to take with meals. Lipitor isnt as fat soluble and rosuva prava etc are water soluble so i doubt mineral oil had a large effect. $AMRN had a SPA anyway so youre beating a dead horse.

I want to eat your pancakes
6538 2018-12-01 18:22:31 From statesmen to fish oil salesmen. And so completely. POTUS, FLOTUS, the Cabinet and the entire WH staff. We didn't descend the long stairs into darkness... we dove head first down the shaft.
6539 2018-12-01 18:22:19  this is describing actual events. Funnily enough, I do use olive oil soap... it brings back fond memories.

6542 2018-12-01 18:22:13 Let’s hope they don’t run out of oil in the meantime, because unless you live under a rock (or was educated by one) that’s the only reason that area of the world is so altruistic.
6543 2018-12-01 18:22:11 Not for money. Not for oil!
6544 2018-12-01 18:22:05 i been going to this oil change place for years and today i came and everyone was new lmao i said “who tf is danny?”

6547 2018-12-01 18:21:52 Which oil..white or mustard? Also is it the standard garam masala of clove cinnamon cardamom?
6548 2018-12-01 18:21:37 Myeah... Let's just ignore the fact that the last "liberal" occupant of the White House was also a Neoliberal, war for oil psychopath. Cool.
6549 2018-12-01 18:21:36 I’m either in a button down for work or I’m buck ass naked drippin in coconut oil when I’m off. Ain’t no in between. So nah I don’t got none.
6550 2018-12-01 18:21:33 Ohio you bought his snake oil. So sorry. Thoughts and prayers.
6551 2018-12-01 18:21:32 Unless you can’t tolerate it, do not skimp on the garlic. Fresh cloves are ideal, but I seldom have any on hand, so I always keep a few small jars in my pantry. The minced kind that’s kept in acidified water or oil.
6552 2018-12-01 18:21:26 Neera is just thirsty for stealing oil from the middle east
6553 2018-12-01 18:21:24 Use traditional unrefined oil like Coconut, groundnut, mustard, olive etc etc...or use Indian Ghee made out of milk fat.
6554 2018-12-01 18:21:15 Sure, I've got a cream with castor oil thanks b
6555 2018-12-01 18:21:13 Aren’t the foreign countries we buy oil from much worse on the global environment? You’re just a #nimby.

6560 2018-12-01 18:20:41 Oil cleansing instead of traditional washing (double cleanse when you have makeup on, water ok for 2nd wash). Tone. Treatment products (I’ve been using just 2 products from The Ordinary), and moisturize (I’ve been using grape seed oil). That’s all :) this is at night
6561 2018-12-01 18:20:40 I am not so sure there are that many shorts in oil now.
6562 2018-12-01 18:20:38 Trudeau liberals won’t allow Canada’s oil industry to thrive, they are twisting, turning and bending their reality to try and make themselves look virtuous
6563 2018-12-01 18:20:37 I know that’s just motor oil and cardboard. If you know you know
6564 2018-12-01 18:20:34 So nobody got Oil pens 
6565 2018-12-01 18:20:26 Why we should care about things like this because oil and gas effects our lives and the environment but gas shouldn’t be so cheap now because we turned an eye away from an innocent man being killed that’s all I’m saying
6566 2018-12-01 18:20:05 Yeah, and that's very awesome and fancy. Just the train will begin inappropriate. But the contents I. E the fact. Destiny will never be changed. God bless Yassir.
6567 2018-12-01 18:19:59 Oil well
6568 2018-12-01 18:19:43 I don’t like the smell of Argan oil.
6569 2018-12-01 18:19:39 Yes, thanks for the correction. A refinery but not an oil refinery.  Notable that there is no talk of green energy or sustainability in this speech.
6570 2018-12-01 18:19:31 No, I just wash it once a week and oil my scalp right after I wash it.
6571 2018-12-01 18:19:29 Got my oil changed. What a pain in the ass chore that is.

6574 2018-12-01 18:19:15 Magical thinking. 
I remember being very confused when I moved here in 2013 and the left was fighting for the oil industry.
6575 2018-12-01 18:19:15 Well my brother works in oil industry in Alberta.  And he doesnt blame anyone. But the block of the pipeline. And why do we only need to rely on oil. My home town is in tidal industry and cape breton is going into wind. So why cant this country have other energy resources
6576 2018-12-01 18:19:06 Let’s Saudia Arabia know that as long as we get oil at a cheap price they can do whatever they want especially to our minority citizens because of it was a white journalist it would have been a totally different story.

6580 2018-12-01 18:18:56 <油botとは永遠のライバルであり、良い友達です
6581 2018-12-01 18:18:55 If there is a glut of oil worldwide, pipelines will not help Alberta.  Demand for oil will only decrease in the long-term.  Alberta needs a better plan.
6582 2018-12-01 18:18:55 Dear future husband, you better believe that you will be taking my car to get new tires & an oil change or at the very least, you’ll be going with me because I don’t have the patience for this 
6583 2018-12-01 18:18:43 They're gonna build a pipeline to discharge oil directly into the Athabasca River, so that it can (eventually) get to tidewater.
6584 2018-12-01 18:18:41 So my father took my car to see if he could get me an oil change - didn’t happen, but he made me(him) an appointment for next week. While he had it, he took my car to the car wash. I asked if he filled it up to. His facial expression... 
6585 2018-12-01 18:18:38 Whack cooling idea 
Nickel/copper antisieze compound at thermal paste 
And water soluble oil cutting fluid (mixed with water ofc)
6586 2018-12-01 18:18:32 The best part about coolking with coconut oil is that if you get any on you it’s just lotion !!

6595 2018-12-01 18:17:54 Remember how the first couple of weeks of the ACA/Obamacare exchanges were kinda glitchy? The GOP screamed bloody murder, demanded that everyone involved should be boiled in oil, and that the entire thing be torn down.
Then the Obama Admin fixed it. 
Dems govern. The GOP won't.

6599 2018-12-01 18:17:36 You think this is the first time bus services were cut because of short falls in School funding? BC has had a carbon tax for 15 years.  Services weren't cut for any specific tax, only for funding cuts.  Perks to oil and gas profits outweigh school funding.

They are the fuel for the biggest part of the rally watching them all cover and run. Way too big of a short position in oil.

6607 2018-12-01 18:16:57 Lol you really should try a Yorkshire sometime, frozen or not....just a basic batter mix (like pancakes) only seasoned with a bit of salt. Just pour  into hot  cake/muffin tray with a spot of oil in bottom to stop sticking, and baked in very hot oven until they rise like soufflé
6608 2018-12-01 18:16:56 My guess is a lot of oil money buying compliance from people with influence.
6609 2018-12-01 18:16:56 Til then, oil & coal are cheap &, yes, plentiful, not to mention natural gas. Cheap assets drive the future, UNLESS burdened by rediculous regs intended 2 stop their use. If U want better shoes, you don't throw away the ones U have now AND shoot your foot first B4 U get new 1's.
6610 2018-12-01 18:16:55 Got the onions sweated down, got the cooking oil added in and the spices. :D We're getting a good base for the doro wat coming!
6611 2018-12-01 18:16:43 Please use crude oil on your head .
Maybe you will grow something...if lucky weed grass
6612 2018-12-01 18:16:40 Mr Atiku, George H.W Bush is far from what you described him, his atrocities in the Gulf war, atrocities in Iraq etc will never be forgotten.

6614 2018-12-01 18:16:35 I heard castor oil helps ! /:
6615 2018-12-01 18:16:32 I exposed your lies on oil and reserves, u are jumping to other issues. Is the FBI report on him a lie? Were his acomplice not found guilty? Was he not banned for years? Stay on issues bros and stop jumping from pillar to post
6616 2018-12-01 18:16:30 And it also gives us warning, friends, to know that Jesus said, “When this sleeping virgin had begin to come in to buy oil, that was when the bridegroom was coming.” So when we see by that, when we see the Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran, coming in to...
6617 2018-12-01 18:16:29 #UKOG BB was a learning curve. Everyone learnt something. #Horsehill is producing a lot of oil. 

Yet the same Swampies and shorts are still saying the same deramping trash.

The eyes video do not lie much to the nay sayers displeasure.

Shame :)
6618 2018-12-01 18:16:20 Devil wey them dey put oil for hin head  Esu ni e they kuku warned me to be scared of short people. Na me no hear.
6619 2018-12-01 18:16:17 cant ever see it happening. Also, how would Scotland survive? Tourism? Oil? And look at those big companies in Edinburgh (RBS, TescoBank, Sainsburys Bank etc). They would leave Scotland. Wont happen IMHO.
6620 2018-12-01 18:16:02 I own E&Ps who are profitable at $60 oil or less. I need SP500 and oil both rising. I don't need oil back at $75 for my E&Ps to be doing well.
6621 2018-12-01 18:15:47 Because I’m extra and coon like i had the butcher cut two packs of ribs into cubes so I can deep fry them in peanut oil
6622 2018-12-01 18:15:45 Lololol when has Alberta ever been apologetic about our oil and gas sectors? What a clown this guy is.
6623 2018-12-01 18:15:37 Great quote, but oil is pretty miserable and I’m not touching it. $btc equally miserable on the other hand and I find it very hard not to buy, daily.
6624 2018-12-01 18:15:35 Malick, Exon has been 'called back'. No surprise. Standard oil is back. Old rookies Alert.
6625 2018-12-01 18:15:35 Hope Lush cosmetics are oil free
6626 2018-12-01 18:15:25 How are you planning to change this from happening? How are you going to get oil out of our province so that we’re not selling it at a massive discount?
6627 2018-12-01 18:15:19 Gotta fight against the foreign money trying to keep our oil cheap. No pipeline is lose lose for canadians

6631 2018-12-01 18:15:07 You’re selling snake oil in the form of nutritional misinformation. Advocating/preaching is selling.
6632 2018-12-01 18:15:07 One solar powerplant incinerates more than 6000 birds/year. When 1 bird is found covered in oil the screaming meemies are unleashed. #MAGA #MAGAVeteran
6633 2018-12-01 18:15:04 Let me guess... She will enact @jkenney's plan to restrict oil output, take all credit for it, then accuse Kenney of opposing it. Then she'll then blame Kenny for "not building" the NorthernGateway & EnergyEast pipelines that she helped shut down through protest action.
6634 2018-12-01 18:14:42 WTI back at 75 ?? Seriously ? I am happy with 54 this week. Are you not worried about this new pipeline in Texas and the potential for more shale oil in the market ?
6635 2018-12-01 18:14:33 olive oil
6636 2018-12-01 18:14:32 Lifting of sanctions so they can team up to drill for oil. Having an American president in their pocket who will turn the other way when they expand their Empire.
6637 2018-12-01 18:14:29 Nice!!! This one is made with eggs, almond flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, olive oil
6638 2018-12-01 18:14:26 Probably did not hate the country but put power & profit above all. Remember Iran/Contra? How about privatized prison stock? Iraq war 4 oil? A lot to think about here. Maybe u R just young & don’t remember “welfare queen” lies? The Willie Horton ads? fake Gary Hart scandal?
6639 2018-12-01 18:14:23 This little girl came up to me while I was getting my oil changed today & she asked me if I would read a book to her & my response was “can’t you read it yourself?” & this is why I don’t have kids yet 
6640 2018-12-01 18:14:21 ... I got some coconut oil ... bring some of the veggies over and we'll have a stir fry ...

6641 2018-12-01 18:14:12 Let's not forget the the Hinkley's were oil executive partners, family friends and NEIGHBORS to the Bush's. 

Thank goodness for older people to remind all you young pups about former "realities!"

Respect the elders. They have shit on everybody!!!!

Yes, tell that to the millions who make their living off coal.
6643 2018-12-01 18:14:04 Why has d French Spring taken a revolutionary decibel - d type that prodded Jules Ferry to make case for colonialism? The answer is: none of her ex-colonies, which are tied to Paris at present, produces oil from whence to steal from. Brits are not whining bcos SHELL ain't ELF

6651 2018-12-01 18:13:43 You keep forgetting the Saudis did nothing wrong and did not plunge the market. Trump did. Trump literally stabbed every single oil producer in the world in the back on Nov 5th. That Iran oil was supposed to be cut off completely that day.
6652 2018-12-01 18:13:41 @talkSPORTLive 
The way United are going down, they'll soon discover crude oil!

6653 2018-12-01 18:13:36 Obama  tried to kill off fracking with a rule designed to burden the oil  industry with excessive reporting requirements which would allow the EPA  to delay and derail new exploration and drilling.
6654 2018-12-01 18:13:30 Hello whats the score  yeah true that. Saudi Oil 
6655 2018-12-01 18:13:29 In 4 years he dragged us into 3 major military conflicts. One which ended up leading to 9-11 and involving us in the Middle East for the past 28 years. It also made all his friends in the oil business extremely wealthy.
6656 2018-12-01 18:13:19 Yea. It was super-interesting to do that. Also I'll get a liter of olive oil for helping. :)
6657 2018-12-01 18:13:19 I understand oil is based on ups and downs The issue is not that oil comes and goes everyone knows that The issue is the government and how they are treating the industry They are making bad choices. Look at the US their oil and gas is booming right now. Investors are going south
6658 2018-12-01 18:13:15 There’s a Grand-dad oil / Helicopter manufacturing / Vietnam War triad also...
6659 2018-12-01 18:13:13 Food for oil program....that killed about a million Iraqi children ...he was behind it and so was Clinton...then came baby Bush and took over the rest ...
6660 2018-12-01 18:13:05 This speech makes it clear AMLO will NOT champion environmental issues.
Other than banning fracking, his energy platform is to reinvigorate the oil industry. Drill, baby, drill.

6665 2018-12-01 18:12:47 I tried having a conversation with my dad about climate change which lead him into talking about how the moon could be artificial, aliens perceived as a “higher power” and the possibility of oil on mars - he really thought I was talking conspiracy theories. SMH

6669 2018-12-01 18:12:20 These cuts are going to be the same as removing Iran's oil which puts WTI back up to $75 in relatively short order. The draws are going to start hitting regardless very soon. Refineries are back up to 95%+. SPR is done releasing I believe. Imports are going to drop.

6683 2018-12-02 23:59:05 in the Canadian context, while Trudeau seems to be everyone's 'heartthrob' PM, he has yet to enact aid to Indigenous people, he didn't protest oil pipelines, and just recently, for example, signed away the decision making for the Canadian Dairy industry to the US, etc.

6714 2018-12-02 23:57:03 Now “that” makes sense. I couldn’t imagine the French rioting over the cost of oil/living, but not the invasion of Moslems. And it all falls on Macron.
6715 2018-12-02 23:57:01 Funny, about a week ago Obama was claiming it was him for why the US is now the #1 producer of oil and the whole "drill baby drill" thing. Maybe you should have started there if he got us where we are. Sounds like it continues. Blame him!

6718 2018-12-02 23:56:33 Conducting a consultation and approval process as required by law isn’t allowing special interests groups to dictate energy policy. However, fast-tracking pipeline impact assessments & approvals for oil and gas companies would be exactly that.

6725 2018-12-02 23:55:20 OMG just how much oil are you using? This recipe is so easy.
6726 2018-12-02 23:55:04 Guys you look this stuff up. Global oil demand is currently 100 million B/D a day and growing. Natural gas 4 000 bcm/year and growing, coal demand is only expected to drop by 1% in 4 years (power from coal increased 1% percent). The prices decreased because supply increased.
6727 2018-12-02 23:55:01 I once had a hair brained idea to put oil, salt and popcorn kernels into a brown paper bag and put it into the microwave oven, I thought that was all I needed to make my own microwave popcorn. What I made was a 911 call.  The bag burst into flames inside the microwave.......
6728 2018-12-02 23:54:56 The squeaky wheel gets the oil

6731 2018-12-02 23:54:41 Lol palm oil really
6732 2018-12-02 23:54:38 But "Big Oil" has always had a seat in urban planning. Just look at the highway commossions in Texas and other oil country.

6735 2018-12-02 23:54:14 We have sanctions on Iran, too. Yet WTI has been going down. These indexes reflect that the global price has dropped. That should be the case for France as well as oil is fungible.
6736 2018-12-02 23:54:11 Here I am being a good dubi & taking my car to get an oil change. & boom now they can’t close the hood of the car. Que maldito lio.
6737 2018-12-02 23:53:59 I’m so intolerant to lax bc I’ve built up resistance, but the “normal” dosage of castor oil to drink is 15mil for a regular adult
6738 2018-12-02 23:53:53 @SpeakerUpmeyer Why are you against medicinal cannabis? why not expand our almost non existent laws? It has been proven to have almost no existing negative effects. wouldent you rather have someone use THC and CBD oil for every issue it can help? pills prescribed today damage
6739 2018-12-02 23:53:39 Thinks to low oil prices Canadian car sales are the worst since the 60’s.  The big three (GM, Chrysler, Ford) have previously admitted that manufacturing cars in Ontario is the most expensive in the world. Carbon tax could be the nail in the coffin for them.
6740 2018-12-02 23:53:36 @realDonaldTrump Won't disrespect Bush, he was a wealthy oil president who made every effort to rule this country through his sons. God gave us #TRUMP to clean up the GLOBAL mess the Bush family, Clinton's and Obama made. We need a Tiger, and God gave us the KING of Tigers! #MAGA
6741 2018-12-02 23:53:25 @greenandblacks can you tell me what your stance on palm oil is in your products please?
6742 2018-12-02 23:53:15 Lol ok if you do whit chocolate you have to add a little oil to the chocolate as your warning it 
6743 2018-12-02 23:52:57 Oil cuts should mean developing alternative  economic dependence
6744 2018-12-02 23:52:51 เจอแม่แล้วก็ต้องเจอพ่อสิเนาะ  ไหนๆพ่อก็ยกลูกสาวให้แล้ว
6745 2018-12-02 23:52:28 Selulit itu. Olahraga kali ya atau bio oil/lucas papaw
6746 2018-12-02 23:52:28 You're just supposed to drizzle oil on the cauliflower not try to deep fry it in your oven. How much oil did you use?
6747 2018-12-02 23:52:21 下手やけどね笑
6748 2018-12-02 23:52:16 昨夜は私も何億年ぶりくらいにM1見てひとりで大笑いして我に返るを繰り返してましたよ。
6749 2018-12-02 23:52:07 Sharpen my knives and oil my guns.
6750 2018-12-02 23:52:04 You are also forgetting about the electricity saved by not refining crude oil into gasoline
6751 2018-12-02 23:51:56 The palm oil industry has managed to frame this beautifully as an east vs West story. But it’s big western companies like Unilever, Nestle, Pepsi which are the main beneficiaries. The low paid workers are mainly originally migrants from overpopulated Java & peninsular Malaysia.
6752 2018-12-02 23:51:18 スマホでツイッター開いてもないのにキャッシュが増えるしびっくりするくらい電池量が減ってくのでアンインストールしたはいいんだけど、PCをなかなか開く時間が取れずツイッターできないまま１２月も３日も過ぎたし、その間にまた１つ歳を取ったしでおばちゃんグロッキー（死語）おはようございます。
6753 2018-12-02 23:51:13 #ModiAmitscam
It's @narendramodi who made Ambani-King of India by offering him Jio, University, Lowering rupee value to benifit Ambani crude oil, PVC Granule, Allow insurance, 116 oil wells, etc.
Now Refale & than to Adani with pipe gas distribution contract in 35 cities etc
6754 2018-12-02 23:50:54 La vida apenas comienza para mi. OIL.
6755 2018-12-02 23:50:50 i spend every food commercial trying to figure out what everything ACTUALLY is...i wont be tricked by motor oil anymore
6756 2018-12-02 23:50:48 Stop dragging your  knuckles on the ground and get out of your cave. It’s real. It’s happenning. I feel bad for those who will be impacted by cuts to oil production but it’s time to wean ourself off of it. It’s a key factor in the climate mess.
6757 2018-12-02 23:50:31 Greenpeace knows that! Canada is easy pickings, because many Canadians, aided and abetted by our own politicians, believe the attack on our oil is about climate change, when it's really about huge profits for the American eco-colonialist scammers!
6758 2018-12-02 23:50:10 All that, and you completely miss the fact that only 13% of all crude oil goes to gasoline. Pathetic.
6759 2018-12-02 23:50:05 Everyone has forgotten about Hilary's ties to Benghazi. I'm not a Trump supporter, but Hillary had deep ties to Benghazi, her family had deep ties to the oil company that was owned in OK by black businessmen.  Not a fan of Trump at all
6760 2018-12-02 23:49:54 This morning I shaved with some coconut oil and oouuu 
6761 2018-12-02 23:49:50 Olives. Olive oil. Greek cheeses and more now at Olive Tree Market. Cash only. 45-07 30th ave. #Astoria #Greek #shoplocal #perfectgifts #olives #cheese #chocolate
6762 2018-12-02 23:49:42 ね。忙しくて行けないこと多いと陰鬱になるけど、行けたとき爆発させましょ。最近思い爆発させたいマンなんだよね（笑）
6763 2018-12-02 23:49:41 Why can't the Government of Alberta build a refinery to handle at least some of the oil from the tar sands? We would create some badly needed jobs, and get to keep some of the profits from out "cheap" oil in Alberta
6764 2018-12-02 23:49:40 also, "jobs" promised in louisiana is typically that of oil/manufacturing....grey color (uber, service industry, "sub-30") jobs are typically ignored by local representatives because they lack long-term subsidies to support them
6765 2018-12-02 23:49:22 Enlighten me also.  16 years in the oil and gas field with the utmost respect from males. Some of the worst sexual harassment has been from powerful politicians. Namely Liberals.   Let’s start there and detail the last 3 years.
6766 2018-12-02 23:49:16 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
6767 2018-12-02 23:49:11 هذه المعلومة توي قرأتها. صندوق النقد الدولي يقول نقطة التعادل 88 دولار و ليس 73 دولا للبرميل كما ذكرت سابقاً
The International Monetary Fund estimates Saudi's breakeven point at $88 a barrel for Brent oil, which is almost half of current levels.
6768 2018-12-02 23:49:06 It’s crazy how Africa is one of the wealthiest continents but the poorest at the same time... we have so much resources i.e. oil, coal, diamonds etc, however the problem is our people have no sense of unity.
6769 2018-12-02 23:49:02 5:48 Midnight Oil - Kosciusko
6770 2018-12-02 23:48:59 @HouseDemocrats need to question Rex Tillerson! He lied to US saying he no longer had any interest in the @exxonmobil oil deal with Russia which would have been his largest deal but sanctions killed it. He left Exxon to join trump administration where he tried to lift sanctions.
6771 2018-12-02 23:48:55 this is literally the story w/ Gaddafi, Heussein, Assad, and all over Africa, but sometimes with other things instead of oil: coltan in Zaire/Congo

Congolese only keep 20% of the market value of the minerals we dig up there, and we support brutal dictators who allow it to happen
6772 2018-12-02 23:48:51 ETH = internet oil?

No, ETH is an internet traffic jam
ETC is a private parking lot traffic jam

If @cburniske knew anything about crypto he would not pump traffic jams.
1. The whole idea of Smart Contracts is fishy
2. Tokens are getting shut down
3. ETH tech has no use but scam
6773 2018-12-02 23:48:45 Oh my god. Every oil. For everything. I literally use no medicine, make all my own cleaners. I have eliminated 98% of the toxins in my life
6774 2018-12-02 23:48:41 Shetland has an oil fund why didn't others?
6775 2018-12-02 23:48:39 Had a good discussion about cbd oil.

But with my addictive personality; more than likely no bueno. I was trying to describe what I felt like after mom let me try 2 drops from her own bottle, to Chris, which brought up the discussion.
6776 2018-12-02 23:48:33 #Oil short term is out of its bear trend. A quick move to 54.50. Clears above that then 59 to 60. Big support at 51.80 now.
6777 2018-12-02 23:48:26 why these 12 year olds came in asking if we sell massage oil...bruh
6778 2018-12-02 23:48:17 @Fred_Kirsch is @JumboHart drilling for oil in the press box after that TD?
6779 2018-12-02 23:48:14 You caught the @HoloPlaysGames curse. Vehicles and him are like oil and water.
6780 2018-12-02 23:48:04 mom *talking to my stepdad* : “honey we should have a date night and u should bring me to Olive Oil’s” 

........

she really meant to say Olive Garden y’all  I cant
6781 2018-12-02 23:48:03 There’s oil! Rebbe James says it counts, anyway
6782 2018-12-02 23:48:00 Perming Ameo you can ingest it, and use for headaches. Make cough drops with coconut oil, Keto desserts or just use it in your hands to wake you up.
6783 2018-12-02 23:47:57 That Chris Watts b*stard, apparently when he couldn't get his baby down the oil tank tube he put his boot on top of her head and stomped her down  ugh I hope he gets the same treatment in prison. This case has broken my heart 
6784 2018-12-02 23:47:50 I have a sudden urge to make an 8ft tall oil painting this is nOT GOOD
6785 2018-12-02 23:47:35 Gotta check the math in each market. 

BUT heat pumps aren’t just good options vs oil/propane. 

They are remarkably viable vs gas.
6786 2018-12-02 23:47:19 tea tree oil on pimples; and lavender + mint in a diffuser for calm, sometimes with lemongrass, sometimes with pine tree oil 
6787 2018-12-02 23:47:01 I get the feeling there may not be a great long term future in oil
6788 2018-12-02 23:47:00 I switched from waxing to threading recently because my brows weren’t growing back after waxing. Threading is painful asf, but it looks nice for roughly 3-5 weeks. Also no oil involved, so not as likely to break your face/forehead out.
6789 2018-12-02 23:46:57 You're the crudest oil, let your vision boil
Yeah, they're gonna dig a coal-face out of you
6790 2018-12-02 23:46:53 Ask Oil Company Executives:   Most Likely Answer,  it happened by overcoming obstreperous Obama rules and regulations.
6791 2018-12-02 23:46:52 Yes bombing women and children in a war over oil to benefit greedy US oil companies was totally justified. You're an awesome person.
6792 2018-12-02 23:46:49 Trudeau is focusing gender diversity on oil workforce because it fits his political agenda

If he was really concerned about gender diversity he should go back to his old hangouts as a student

University campuses have seen an increase of 100% or more reported sexual harassments
6793 2018-12-02 23:46:46 How did he did ?? So I can tell his oil bro @JuwaanEspinal
6794 2018-12-02 23:46:46 I oil the waffle iron, lightly, bc no oil, no Hanukkah, but YMMV
6795 2018-12-02 23:46:46 途中から有志の人が残してくれてるからはじめの無いんよなぁ……あと三日で本戦も終わるし……
6796 2018-12-02 23:46:44 ur my oil
6797 2018-12-02 23:46:44 Oil, cheese or chocolate? What am I saying? They are all staples.
6798 2018-12-02 23:46:40 Any shampoo with Argan oil should be fine as long as it's the main product. I had this same issue
6799 2018-12-02 23:46:37 わかる…全部わかる……
6800 2018-12-02 23:46:32 Makes a big mess in the oven.  Oil splatters all over the place.
6801 2018-12-02 23:46:28 I just checked. Genco is not a real brand of olive oil. I’m disappointed.
6802 2018-12-02 23:46:16 fried rice of clam and salmon salad. . .9
lemon oil and ricotta melt. . .30
whole-wheat romaine leaves. . .29
organic four-sausage polenta. . .21
6803 2018-12-02 23:46:15 Just got my @ShimanoMTB ZEE brakes installed from the shop. Noticed leaking on both calipers at the bleed port. Wtf?! Pads and rotors are now fucked from the oil seeping out. Brand new and only 2 rides on them!! For the price, plus shop fees, I’m decently pissed the fuck off! 
6804 2018-12-02 23:46:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but illegal immigration.
6805 2018-12-02 23:46:08 Thanks!! For Hanukkah, I’d love for you to support @Ocasio2018’s #GreenNewDeal from the @sunrisemvmt. There will be no oil miracle to save us, only a historic investment in green energy. Be a hero!
6806 2018-12-02 23:46:08 Grape seed oil smells like eucalyptus
6807 2018-12-02 23:46:07 i use rosehip oil on my face!! i have really oily skin so my only problem is that it makes my face suuuuper oily, but if i sleep with it on then it soaks in overnight. it’s reduced my acne so so so much, i truly don’t know what i’d do without it!!
6808 2018-12-02 23:46:06 They started to watch football only last season lol , oil money pundits
6809 2018-12-02 23:45:47 No, it’s only thing I’ve yet to try. I’ve been through Vic, Bowl of Steam, olbus oil, double dose of Vitamin C and Paracetamol every 4 hours. Does hot lemon work? I’m getting desperate haha
6810 2018-12-02 23:45:31 These two guys control over 30% of the world oil supply. In a few days they will raise revenues by cutting production by less than they raise prices. That is what they are laughing about.
6811 2018-12-02 23:45:30 Once again we celebrate Hanukkah - in memory of that time long ago when we Jews scored a great bargain on lamp oil.
6812 2018-12-02 23:45:27 Ahh I now see that this was referring to earlier thread (which I hadn’t seen) on oil demand.

Anywho, maybe I’m an outlier. It I don’t think so. We shouldn’t discount the notion that people actually like living in suburbs,+if that’s the case it’s hard to blame social engineering
6813 2018-12-02 23:45:20 We should annex Venezuela , in addition to needing help they’re sitting on the largest oil reserves in the globe.
6814 2018-12-02 23:45:13 I had similar issues earlier this week and it went away overnight when I drank some tea with honey, took cold & flu medicine, and drank lots of water/gatorade. I also used an essential oil called Thieves and rubbed on my throat which helps with immunity
6815 2018-12-02 23:44:57 Leave in conditioner and argan oil shampoo
6816 2018-12-02 23:44:55 If you like a lot of mustard oil on your paratha, join our club!
6817 2018-12-02 23:44:44 My new bottle of Refresh oil from @SajeWellness doesn’t hit you in the back of the sinus like my old bottles did 
6818 2018-12-02 23:44:35 If there's one thing I hate about the crypto scene (other than its right wing nut job origins and demented snake oil peddling) it's the constantly trying to sound smart by employing the most lame consultant-speak possible.  "Core tenet".  <pukes>
6819 2018-12-02 23:44:22 Alberta Premier Rachel Notley expected to make a major announcement about oil production and closing the price gap. We’ll have her address live at six @GlobalCalgary and reaction. #albertaoilcrisis @globalnews
6820 2018-12-02 23:44:15 Nah, it’s Pessach where we slaughter the chicken - this one is Hannukka and it’s all about vegetable oil and how many things can be fried in it like donuts and potato latkes.
6821 2018-12-02 23:44:05 We like to toss florets in a gallon Ziplock bag w/Olive Oil, Himalayan Salt & Ground Pepper; then we roast it on a lightly oiled baking sheet or casserole dish at 425 for 22 mins; check it & flip it to consistently roast it, and then watch it for another 10-20 mins. Kids love it!
6822 2018-12-02 23:43:50 Probably refers to flour tortilla rather than corn. Proper tacos use corn tortillas, quickly cooked in hot oil, so they’re greasy and flexible, not hard. Hard shell are usually dry, pre-cooked, packaged corn like you get at a Taco Bell. They crack and crumble at first bite.
6823 2018-12-02 23:43:46 Olive oil
6824 2018-12-02 23:43:38 Oil of God’s favour operate in my life, make me likeable, attractable and acceptable to my divine helpers in the name of Jesus
6825 2018-12-02 23:43:28 What I really don’t understand is   oil prices have plummeted in the past month. Even with the tax their cost should’ve gone down. This feels orchestrated to me.
6826 2018-12-02 23:43:28 Like I told you @JavierBlas :  never bet against Saudi Arabia, because it's tantamount to a bet against Allah, you will lose every time -- just look at the terrible situation Canadian oil is in, or the bankruptcy bust that is looming in Texas #shale.  Enjoy "cheap" oil at $80-99
6827 2018-12-02 23:43:20 nation B: those private investors who fund those private companies from nation A are extracting our oil and leaving the country with it, only paying us a fraction of what it's worth. let's nationalise our oil and sell it at market value, and use that money for social programs
6828 2018-12-02 23:43:19 And our oil is being sold at $14 a barrel. I know, I know. I just don't understand.
6829 2018-12-02 23:43:17 Only hoes use essential oil diffusers and incense. Be careful out there Kings get you a wifey
6830 2018-12-02 23:43:10 U can put some oil on your daily body cream too, olive, coconut, almond, vitamin E is good too, if u put it directly u have to be careful with the sun cuz they can tan your skin, exfoliate once a week to remove old skin, etc xD
6831 2018-12-02 23:43:02 You need to find out what beard oil he uses
6832 2018-12-02 23:42:45 Now people needs to do oil changes!
6833 2018-12-02 23:42:45 They own 115 bi of US debt and massive private equity positions. We send them money for oil, they return some by propping up Western arms industries and buying assets. It's win-win for the powerful elites involved.
6834 2018-12-02 23:42:39 Toner is good for oily/acne prone skin & can be helpful for shrinking pores, restoring you skin’s pH, adding a layer of protection to your skin, refreshing your skin and helping to remove any additional dirt or oil on your face after cleansing!
6835 2018-12-02 23:42:30 I swear every time I buy my oil filter, there’s ALWAYS A DAMN PISTACHIO SHELL IN THE BOX 
6836 2018-12-02 23:42:27 I love Trader Joe’s but they have a lot of palm oil in their shit, and I’m like but what about the orangutans? Like I just found out their broccoli crisps use palm oil 
6837 2018-12-02 23:42:25 so funny that people suddenly care about orangutans dying for palm oil, yet completely ignore the hundreds of farm animals being slaughtered every day for their bacon sandwiches 
6838 2018-12-02 23:42:24 Trudeau's Libs are building up quite a track record. Killed pipelines and the Oil industry, then blew NAFTA & Tariffs while using Dias as their spokesperson and now GM. #JustinsJournos continue the war on Conservatives, but we know Trudeau & Dias are Canada's real problems.

6839 2018-12-02 23:42:16 Even when he spoke about wanting to enter America into a new world order. You forgot the deals with the Saudi’s for oil while starting a war that did not advance the interest of America. You should be more informed before you say what someone loved. I served too during that time
6840 2018-12-02 23:42:08 the khashoggi killing may be an example...Trump suggested (???) the ME needs to stop jihadism, or risk losing the oil fields?.....
6841 2018-12-02 23:42:03 When will you renounce your ties to anti-Semitic extremists?
Hannukah wishes means nothing until you stand with Saudi Arabia, who is fighting anti-Semitic Iran who seeks to destroy the Jewish peoples.
6842 2018-12-02 23:41:53 Oil prices are falling on the  world market.  Why would there be a rise in fuel prices in December???
6843 2018-12-02 23:41:40 today's Neurologist prescription: needs brain mapping, keep eating fish oil, read Temple Grandin, avoid drug addicts, MINDdiet. 
..Progress.
6844 2018-12-02 23:41:33 Does it contain palm oil?
6845 2018-12-02 23:41:33 No but I’ll take an oil change
6846 2018-12-02 23:41:31 51 of @raphael_lessard told by officials his leaking oil and has to hit pit road under caution.
6847 2018-12-02 23:41:19 animal oil is cheap, business use it for that reason. can also alter a recipe if no dairy in milk. there is R&D to all these products. also your personal choice is yours. I don't go around complaining about gluten or dairy free establishments, I just avoid them.
6848 2018-12-02 23:41:16 Crazy, because oil prices are down considerably as of late
6849 2018-12-02 23:41:03 Now if only I could find some godly oil ....
6850 2018-12-02 23:40:57 Ya the east needs to give themselves a slap in the face and head. 3/4's of them are up working in fort McMurray oil sands and they vote for the idiot that wants to shut it all down.
6851 2018-12-02 23:40:48 Easier said than done. You will have to start with Citizens United and the super PACs. Far to many Congressmen get far too much money from the big interests. For example, NRA, big Pharma, big oil, financial institutions, and on, and on...
6852 2018-12-02 23:40:48 Psalms 104:4 “He makes his ministers a flame of fire.” Am I ignitible? God deliver me from the dread asbestos of “other things.” Saturate me with the oil of the Spirit that I may be a flame. But flame is transient, often short-lived. Canst thou bear this, my soul, short life? 1/2
6853 2018-12-02 23:40:48 がんばえー
6854 2018-12-02 23:40:46 I need to get some more coconut hair oil & hairfinity pills 
6855 2018-12-02 23:40:45 อาจจะอยู่ในร้อยรูป เก็บไว้ก่อนค่อยลงวันสำคัญ ^_^
6856 2018-12-02 23:40:36 行きたくても行けないことが多々あるからライブがあるときに自分の予定が空いてるのもすごいことだなぁって意味ね。
6857 2018-12-02 23:40:34 We let the EU pillage it? I hadn’t heard that before. All the N Sea oil and most of the gas are in British and Norwegian seas. You can blame the government for selling off our share, while Norway kept it in state hands and used it to build a colossal sovereign wealth fund (>$1tn)
6858 2018-12-02 23:40:33 狗狼くーん！あっ違ったカミ君ー！
6859 2018-12-02 23:40:22 I agree it was about the sanctions so Trump could build his hotel, and I know Putin wants Ukraine for gas and oil, and the Magnitsky Act to be lifted, but I feel there is still more. Why is the majority of the Republican Party okay with selling out the USA? #thereismore
6860 2018-12-02 23:40:21 Can I suggest you read the four part series by Mongabay, 'The Palm Oil Fiefdom'..modern oil palm industry built on astounding corruption...everything else collateral damage..numbers published in Feb stated Borneo had lost 150,000 orangs in 16 years...RSPO has been around for 14?
6861 2018-12-02 23:40:20 Good evening and thanks Dwight. It is a holiday for all who love freedom. While not a military victory over the Greeks, it was about worship, and the miracle of the oil lasting 8 days.
6862 2018-12-02 23:40:13 'Tis true. Check razor blades and Oil of Olay.
6863 2018-12-02 23:40:11 オススメデッキください #lov3 #lovfan
6864 2018-12-02 23:40:11 Also Fuck HW for perhaps starting the trend of waspy white guys from the northeast moving to Texas, making a fortune in oil or some other extractive industry, and acting all folksy even though they've been blue blood their entire life.
6865 2018-12-02 23:40:05 Oil & Water. What you have to be in a toxic environment. #fuckthem #hardertokill
6866 2018-12-02 23:40:03 Best one is the Jersey Mike’s Oil and Vinegar Mixed with a dollop of Mustang mixed all together to dip Nacho Cheese Doritos in.
6867 2018-12-02 23:40:00 Hopefully the oil lasts more than 8 nights!!
6868 2018-12-02 23:40:00 To treat lice, apply olive oil to your hair, and leave on for at least 40 minutes. Shampoo after.
6869 2018-12-02 23:39:30 Best thing on Twitter this year without any doubt or hesitation... the #oott ... have too many things to thank this amazing growing community of oil wonks friends and really cool people! Lets make it grow! #venezuela
6870 2018-12-02 23:39:09 Ladies, if he’s:

- wearing his sandals everywhere
- constantly getting into fights
- always busy during the holidays
- eating a lot of fried foods
- making oil lamps burn for really long times
- overthrowing the yoke of King Antiochus

That’s not your man. That’s Judah Maccabee.
6871 2018-12-02 23:39:05 Uhh officer i just got my oil changed so you have NO reason to be pulling me over
6872 2018-12-02 23:38:58 Jah no, I'm craving Arab money. That petroleum money, oil money.
6873 2018-12-02 23:38:47 Whale oil beef hooked
6874 2018-12-02 23:38:47 #OtexOliveOil need to warn customers the oil stains. My sheets are streaked blue.
6875 2018-12-02 23:38:46 Right always pictured these bunch of muscle guys with dirt and oil all over them now I’m like shit maybe the oil fields are for me
6876 2018-12-02 23:38:43 Throw a couple of drops of eucalyptus essential oil in the bottom of ur shower to create a fantastic steam, it’s like a lil steamy #SelfCare  mixture composed of an invigorating wake up call, clarity, purpose and courage all rolled into shower time 
6877 2018-12-02 23:38:41 Paris is just a break, a sabbatical. gone there for a laugh, training 3 days a week, getting paid not to slag off the manager, he runs the club. earn some arab money, plenty of oil to go around. micky mouse league, he went off injured today and they couldn’t win without him. 
6878 2018-12-02 23:38:30 Love to see this happen to Trudeau in #Canada if he tries to get forceful. #cdnpoli #carbontax #fordnation #pipeline #oil #abpoli #onpoli
6879 2018-12-02 23:38:21 I hear you.  This is morally wrong.  It’s one thing to hunt to eat for survival as we have done for thousands of years; it’s totally different to harm and kill for profit. Business men can get oil from the ground.  This is unnecessary.
6880 2018-12-02 23:38:13 Peppermint oil has the same active ingredient as icy hot and similar products, so it can be helpful for tension headaches. (It's the only essential oil I'll defend.)

But no, it's not a panacea for migraines (and I've got a cabinet full of migraine meds, myself).

6884 2018-12-02 23:37:29 Oz is the worst kind of crook. Someone who knows and has done better but sells snake oil purely for the money. Sellout.
6885 2018-12-02 23:37:23 I tried putting peppermint oil in my hair and I can not get the smell out looool I smell like a candy cane
6886 2018-12-02 23:37:11 Not sure about you, but I really miss @garytmills covering Jacksonville’s dining biz. If he were, I wouldn’t have driven all the way to Neptune Beach for Smashfries only to discover @Smashburger had closed up shop there. @mshackburgers, can you add rosemary/olive oil  to menu?
6887 2018-12-02 23:37:05 take a bunch of vitamins daily so u never get sick. vitamins got ur back. get a womens multi, take some sorta fish oil, biotin helps hair and nails, and i take B and a probiotic for my tummy. also sometimes 5-htp but that ones a lil iffy for some people
6888 2018-12-02 23:36:52 I dont know about Rivian being owned by Saudi Arabia. Is this a oil burner infiltration that wants to fck with EV sales?  Whats really going on here?  Does Rivian have good intentions?

6892 2018-12-02 23:36:37 That quite the crew you have in the oil field!!! 
6893 2018-12-02 23:36:36 U r so blinded by ur self-righteousness that u make foolish claims-like the PTAB is a technical court! It is no such thing. It is a political court appointed by the former head of the PTO who worked at Google-it is also unconstitutional as hinted at in OIL STATES #stayinurlane
6894 2018-12-02 23:36:27 #OIL #OOTT #WTI
WTI gaped up big time. If you didn't enter a long position last Friday, what you can do now is watching others making money. Was it risky to hold long positions over the weekend? Not really. WTI charts foreshadowed the surge tonight.
6895 2018-12-02 23:36:11 "Data is not oil. Data is people." Using this kind of language commoditizes human lives, says another panelist at @element_ai's "Governance of AI" session. #NeurIPS20

6897 2018-12-02 23:35:53 Oil and gas
6898 2018-12-02 23:35:41 Too much oil in the mix!
6899 2018-12-02 23:35:38 What a stupid statement!! Everything is cheaper when oil is cheaper, and that means more disposable income!!! IDIOTS!!!
6900 2018-12-02 23:35:29 Peppermint for headaches, lavendar for calming and I wear an essential oil bracelet.
6901 2018-12-02 23:35:27 Fly over Malaysia & Indonesia and see the miles upon miles of miles of virgin jungle being destroyed by countless jungle fires, clearing pristine jungle being replaced by palm oil plantation and other monoculture. Sweet??
6902 2018-12-02 23:35:20 Well, America is awash with natural gas and the fucking ignorance of Government has oil companies flaring it up into the fucking atmosphere while super cargo ships pollute #Gods World burning dirty oil and cars running on gasoline...
Natural Gas is the fuel for the 21st Century.
6903 2018-12-02 23:35:08 cleaning oil from fries on my hair always feels like the right thing to do.

6907 2018-12-02 23:34:40 What about the social impacts of importing oil from Saudi Arabia? A country who oppresses women's rights. What a double standard.
6908 2018-12-02 23:34:37 Notice particularly the eucalyptus tress with long bare white trunks. These trees are loaded with volatile eucalyptus oil and literally explode in flames. Very mysterious to see them standing adjacent to houses that burned to the ground.
6909 2018-12-02 23:34:31 And both of you want to keep buying their oil...
6910 2018-12-02 23:34:29 If the $$$ spent on wars and weaponry to rob developing countries of their resources were instead used to pay these countries a fair price for their oil/resources then the corruption, mass slaughter and endless wars, waged to benefit but a few greedy rich men would cease.
6911 2018-12-02 23:34:26 No oil...no Latkes!

6932 2018-12-02 23:32:38 On a side note, I once skipped a day of class because I parked in front of a liquor store that was having a sale on Foster’s ( the big oil cans) because they were no longer carrying it. I bought all they had for something ridiculous line 50 cents a can.

6936 2018-12-02 23:32:26 Got the travel kit and the free night time toning oil! I’m blessed and thankful @Kimzolciak
6937 2018-12-02 23:32:24 It doesn’t take two science degrees like he points out he has, to do simple research on how much oil is just sitting around, and figure out why oil prices keep dropping. 

And why gasoline has finally gone below a $1/L. (Should have been dropping a couple years ago).
6938 2018-12-02 23:32:18 I've asked this question countless times.   As long as its not oil, it is fine, I guess.
6939 2018-12-02 23:32:18 i bought bioré strips, cuticle oil and a hockey themed advent calendar and those purchases PERFECTLY sum up my personality.
6940 2018-12-02 23:32:09 It's not a true free market if it's regulated. It was tried for oil. Then failed as one man acquired somewhere about 95% of the supply.

6948 2018-12-02 23:31:04 Yeah. Trump was no mastermind who negotiated lower prices. He looked the other way for some cold blooded murderers if they increased oil production. I hope conservatives can sleep well supporting some evil shit like that.

6961 2018-12-02 23:30:00 So, please, when we have THAT much oil just sitting in barrels waiting to be sold and transported, how is there a great demand?

Current demand has dropped compared to past years. And it continues to drop.

6967 2018-12-02 23:28:55 Problem is oil glut of west texas shale oil overloading market & refineries.  Also refineries closing for maintenance.  Also iran restrictions pushing price up then down with 8 customer exemptions.  East refineries easier access to saudi oil than cross country pipeline.
6968 2018-12-02 23:28:54 And the funny thing is the French LIBERTY and FREEDOM is supporting GENOCIDE in Southern Cameroon to steal oil and gas. LEADERSHIP is the key. Vote out all Globalist.
6969 2018-12-02 23:28:41 #NOKSEK was a given a boon at the #G20Summit after fears of escalating trade wars subsided and amid news of an OPEC and Non-OPEC member meeting that will take place on Dec 6 in Vienna to discuss "re-balancing" oil production. Norway is a major petroleum exporter.
6970 2018-12-02 23:28:40 If demand was high, demand would cause prices to increase, not decrease. It’s decreasing to try to sell all the oil they have in reserve. OPEC estimates there are 1.651 trillion barrels of crude oil in reserves waiting to be sold. 

That’s a lot of oil sitting around.

6986 2018-12-02 23:26:35 not sure i agree, USDCNH is not easy to short. it's done more in option mkt cause of low IV.
so far AUD USD, Copper Oil, ASX doing very well.
so far i bot ASX at open it's already up 60bps for me. i will look to bot China A shares and maybe some spooz.
6987 2018-12-02 23:26:29 It’s not that, it’s just annoying when something as simple as like a chip, for example, that wouldn’t normally need dairy has dairy and you accidentally eat it because why would you think it had it in the first place. Or fries you didn’t know we’re made with animal oil.
6988 2018-12-02 23:26:16 $100m just sounds like a huge amount, but I guess some companies do have capacity to absorb those kinds of sums. I mean there's a reason your oil supermajors don't buy insurance.

7003 2018-12-02 23:24:37 I was in the hair section with hair products in my hands so it was obvious I was asking about coconut oil for the hair plus I meant coconut oil in its solid form. Why would I be asking for cooking oil while standing in the hair section lmfao
7004 2018-12-02 23:24:36 มาเหมือนวันแม่มั้ย อิอิ
7005 2018-12-02 23:24:28 If fossil fuels are in such a “big demand” then why is the prices dropping continuously?
On the NYSE Coal in January 18.23 now 13.88
And Oil may have hit a high around 75 in August, but now it’s falling again around 52. 
Plus there is so much reserved oil that people lost jobs.
7006 2018-12-02 23:24:06 Eh I think it’s much more a both/and focus needed. Oil co’s burying attempts at clean energy & clean transport progress with $ while fueling climate misinformation. $31M to kill I-1631, constant lawsuits & lobbying to repeal clean fuel standards, EV rebates, transit funding, etc
7007 2018-12-02 23:23:43 Dang I don’t have no coconut oil 
7008 2018-12-02 23:23:32 I put peppermint oil instead of eucalyptus oil in my diffuser and now my room smells like a freaking candy cane 
7009 2018-12-02 23:23:29 That’s because international crude oil price has fallen.

7017 2018-12-02 23:22:43 Market manipulation by Norway so to sell more gas and oil aggressively
Given that geothermal energy has been accessible for about 20 years or more, it must be said that Norway has profitted heavily on the knowledge of this and barring World population from affordable and ...1/2

7019 2018-12-02 23:22:33 7 year old kid:
"I'm standing in a puddle in Hunslet,
Everything is dirty black and grey,
Everything is broken,
And I look down at the oil in the little puddle
And I see a rainbow,
And it's a beautiful thing.
It's a beautiful thing."
7020 2018-12-02 23:22:33 Burt’s bees Complete Nourishment Facial Oil is 10/10!!! Totally recommend, it’s been like 3 days I’ve used it and my scars are all damn near gone 
7021 2018-12-02 23:22:30 I'm beginning to think that these oil marketers either don't like being happy or they don't like seeing people celebrate. Why is it that every December is when they remember they haven't been paid subsidy? Why not allow us celebrate the festive season peacefully? @Gidi_Traffic
7022 2018-12-02 23:22:26 But it sure would help many Americans. Instead of paying $3.45/gal a price of $1.85/gal.  Besides, why should Americans pay $3.50 or $5.00/gal for gasoline.  And watch Oil executives stuff millions of dollars into their pockets?  Personally,I don't "WE", you know,  the citizens

7027 2018-12-02 23:22:10 And women don’t do this! Your a fool, social interaction is not a crime! Sexual assault is. Having the PM make false and suggestive hysteria is just another hurdle to prevent Alberta Oil getting to market!

7029 2018-12-02 23:22:02 U.S. and Brent crude oil futures jumped in early trading on Sunday after the United States and China came to an agreement on Saturday on trade issues that would put off new tariffs.
7030 2018-12-02 23:21:51 Of course, he'd prefer snake oil
7031 2018-12-02 23:21:45 Can't Trump (or Putin if Trump's too busy tweeting) call on his pal MBS to help out with oil prices? #MBS_murderer #Khashoggi #IndividualOne #putinownstrump @PutinTrump2020
7032 2018-12-02 23:21:27 Wow. I thought the prices were high here in Seattle, but we are a lot lower. Cal is 2nd highest in gas taxes, Washington is 3rd (6 cents difference) Don't tell me the oil & gas companies might be price gouging drivers in California?

7034 2018-12-02 23:21:21 It’s crucial to know what specific oil fields are offline in Libya at an given moment instead of China’s EV sales over the next 10 years.
7035 2018-12-02 23:21:18 I used to have super ugly skin during winter, but the girl at Sephora recommended using a dab of oil over my moisturizer to lock in the moisture...life changed.

7046 2018-12-02 23:20:00 Hey, @realDonaldTrump , the price of Saudi Crude oil just jumped. You going to denounce MBS aka “The Butcher of Riyadh” now since he isn’t keeping oil prices down as you said.
7047 2018-12-02 23:19:59 I live for peppermint for my headaches and sinuses, and lavender for stress and relaxation. I have a diffuser, but I don’t use it much I usually plug roller balls onto my oil bottles and roll it onto my neck, chest, temples, and wrists.
7048 2018-12-02 23:19:56 #SafeHannukah needs to trend. Hey kids! Make sure you don’t get splattered with oil. Or that teens don’t punch you in the face in Brooklyn! Have a Safe Hannukah!
7049 2018-12-02 23:19:49 the story goes that they finally found 1 bottle of oil left that was still pure, but it miraculously lasted 8 nights, which was long enough to produce new oil & after that they were ok. 
the object we light on chanuka is in memory of that menorah, but with 8 lights instead of 7.
7050 2018-12-02 23:19:43 as predicted friday close, ma8 daily touched. I expect 50.5 test again in 48 hours or more... Do not buy the top do not sell the bottom till hurtricane ends. This is the eye of the hurricane for bulls #crudeoil #usoil #hampetrol #petrol #brent #oil . Sell now.
7051 2018-12-02 23:19:40 "Data is not oil. Data is people." Using this kind of language commoditizes human lives, says another panelist at @element_ai's "Governance of AI" session. #NeurIPS2018

7055 2018-12-02 23:18:58 I did that for almost 2 years and it didn't stop it.  The vanillin and CBD oil cut the inflammation. And two of the popular pharmaceutical drugs increase the risk of lymphoma, can you imagine wanting to take that?
7056 2018-12-02 23:18:53 All they care about is oil an killin people #Oil #oilandgas
7057 2018-12-02 23:18:37 ok so *the* original menorah was a ritual object in the jewish temple. there was only one. it had 7 branches, and was lit (with oil) every night. 
the chanuka story is about not being able to find any oil to light that menorah, because the conquerors had defiled it all.
7058 2018-12-02 23:18:36 High oil, low oil. What difference does it make  We’re using less oil as a % of GDP all the time due to technology. Some day the price will be close to 0. Have you met the Jetson’s?
7059 2018-12-02 23:18:31 chag sameach! may all your oil last longer than it's supposed to.

7067 2018-12-02 23:17:49 I know camps are troubled.

I would like Trudeau to treat camps and oil workers in word and deed like he does reserves, or vice versa.

Same problem, different response.

7070 2018-12-02 23:17:40 Do you use an oil too?
7071 2018-12-02 23:17:31 Harper had no choice. His scheme required white collars and blue. He sacrificed the no collars...with the added bonus that very few writers follow their bar/retail gig with scathing letters to the editor. And we lost that generation to “Oil Patch$$ is superior to Arts Degree $$”
7072 2018-12-02 23:17:01 Are you referring to the 1973 OPEC Oil Embargo? That is what we call a SUPPLY shock. Inflation that results from such an occurrence has no causal link to fiscal spending policies.

7076 2018-12-02 23:16:43 His relationships that he claims he doesn’t have, nonwait,,, he changed that,, no wait,, he flipped again. Reality is he has no leverage in that market. Your prices go up and down by speculation. Here endeth the lesson. Go educate yourself on where we get most of our oil
7077 2018-12-02 23:16:22 When I heard this incident, the first thing that came to my mind was that the authorities should get in touch ASAP with Julius Berger, other Construction companies including the Oil Companies cos they're the ones that could have the equipments.
7078 2018-12-02 23:16:03 I've probably got like $40-$60 put into my spices and herbs that I use. Even more if you count the liquid stuff like sesame seed oil, olive oil, vinegar and shit

7089 2018-12-02 23:14:56 In other words, Trump & his court evangelicals and those loyal to Trump (e.g. Don Young) don’t care so much about the science, so much as they want to use religion to capitalize on such events, in order to further entrench their constituency base and their new EPA and oil agenda.

7094 2018-12-02 23:14:38 @EvanLSolomon   I dont believe that the former head of CSIS was finished and Craig interrupted him. Was he about to say lets get some other countries together and  hurt Saudi by cutting our oil imports? From them.
7095 2018-12-02 23:14:34 I use coconut oil more for an extra hydration, a friend of mine aply rose water and he says that works pretty well calming the itchiness and allergy

7104 2018-12-02 23:12:47 Not so much “fooled” as “made a conscious decision based on gender/racial/class bias.” Shining a spotlight on our own prejudices, of course, is way less fun than vilifying oil companies.

7108 2018-12-02 23:12:15 You don’t think scheer is mean spirited? All I see on their part is blame. They’re very negative adds have turned me off completely. Too much like trump for me. Too much in the pocket of big oil.

Took CBD oil & fish oil & that helped but hasn't gone away till the past few weeks, no itching...I believe it was the vanilla extract...there is a Chinese medical research study on vanillin & psoriasis, it's cheap too.
7114 2018-12-02 23:11:38 Canada's turn may be coming soon. No pipelines to export our oil, open borders, carbon tax. This can't go on for long. My best to you folks. It's a scary world right now.
7115 2018-12-02 23:11:34 I can’t imagine cutting production in Alberta will further their goals.  The US is becoming an exporter and world oil is simply cheap at the moment.  I think Alberta will just lose more market share.  I’m not a Genius like Notley & Kenney tho.  I never went to religious school.
7116 2018-12-02 23:11:19 Bush-41 & 43 had the chance to free us from the grip of Big Oil. They failed us badly.
Now our planet faces serious climate change crisis that could have been avoided or at least slowed down.
They're complicit in the Pentagon heist of trillions$. They could've eradicated poverty.
7117 2018-12-02 23:11:16 The “solution” to Climate Change (lol) being a Carbon Tax isn’t nearly as much about fighting Climate Change as it is about propping up Science companies subsidized by making oil so expensive that Renewable Energy is an option.

7120 2018-12-02 23:11:07 I'm not sure how it is in the US, but heating oil is a pretty big contributor to our oil consumption here in Canada.  Also, deisel used in transport & industry - not all cars, but trains, ships, airplanes, farm equiptment, etc.
7121 2018-12-02 23:11:03 Hormones in cows milk causes oil glands produce too much oil, which causes acne. I’m not dumb it’s science.
7122 2018-12-02 23:10:45 @UShafeeq 800bn oil subsidies unpaid, oil marketers lament. They threatened to shutdown depot, which is not much of a problem coz its December, fuel scarcity is normal at yuletide. 

My worry however is, who’s subsidising who?

7123 2018-12-02 23:10:42 The price is the price, the previous government failed miserably at getting oil to tidewater by screwing up the environmental assessment, consultations with FN and then gutting Coast Guard, which sewered the social license in BC.

7133 2018-12-02 23:10:02 Still on your cake and eat it Platform? You have been exposed as a snake oil salesman though that probably is unfair to them as they just promote unrealizable promises whilst you are a dissembler  of untruth.
7134 2018-12-02 23:09:59 I didn’t say I want the oil companies to gouge.  I am merely saying that the timing could not be worse for the government to impose a new tax that does nothing for the environment.  It is just another way to funnel money into the government coffers at our expense.  Wake up

7136 2018-12-02 23:09:45 go to a handshake event with oil all over your hands so you can moisturise his cuticles
7137 2018-12-02 23:09:42 Cleaned my room, washed and folded my clothes ,changed my oil . Let’s hit the gym and meal prep for the week
7138 2018-12-02 23:09:40 ヤンさんて、絵具は何をお使いなのですか？
私は父が絵描きなので、少し興味を持ちました。父に小さな頃から絵を習ってきました。
自分も油絵の具、Acrylic Paint、Oil Pastel、Water Soluble Pencil、父は本格的な油絵の具、水彩絵の具、筆を持っています。
7139 2018-12-02 23:09:40 American people misled and lied to so often its hard to know if climate change is real and if so is it caused by human activity. Is acid rain and disappearing ozone layer still threat? I remember when we were told the world would run out of oil in 15 years.
7140 2018-12-02 23:09:18 And it was a state owned company. Probably the only big oil state owned company that worked under a democracy. A unique case. Every democratic government before Chavez was, actually...from a socialist party
The guy destroyed a freaking unicorn
7141 2018-12-02 23:09:18 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
7142 2018-12-02 23:09:10 Oil befor freedom thats how they role!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7143 2018-12-02 23:09:01 i do the same thing :( i wanna slather him in cuticle oil
7144 2018-12-02 23:08:49 If the Maccabees really knew how much oil and mess it takes to make latkes they would've blown out the candle after the first night. #HannukkahThoughts
7145 2018-12-02 23:08:49 Your preaching to the choir. Follow the MONEY. Coal and oil contribute to republicans. Republicans dont believe in the science.
7146 2018-12-02 23:08:45 Data is the new oil but data comes from people, we can't just look at people as sources of data and not as humans. Human rights can serve as a useful framework for discussion on societal impacts of #AI - @eimearfarrell at #NeurIPS2018 in #Montreal
7147 2018-12-02 23:08:39 Cinnamon oil is my fav :) it supposedly boosts the immune system and blood circulation but tbh I only like it because it smells like a chai latte...
7148 2018-12-02 23:08:36 My all time fave is neutropenia body oil.  It’s sesame, put immediately after the shower, before towel.  It seizes the water so super moisturizing. BUT make sure it’s absorbed before dressing so it doesn’t get on fabric Just rub it in. Or spend more time naked!
7149 2018-12-02 23:08:35 Typical response. Nothing tangible from the G20 regarding #oil or #China & #Trump and that's uber bullish.

Is the YoY blowout in credit spreads bullish too?
7150 2018-12-02 23:08:29 Hello everyone! I will be hosting a live twitter chat on Wednesday December 5th at  6:00 pm! The chat will go on for at least 40 minutes if not an hour. The name of the twitter live chat will be #OilSpillDiscipline. Here I will bring up various questions/topics about oil spills!
7151 2018-12-02 23:08:28 During these conferences G 8/20, Zio state either attacks Syria or Gaza. I believe that both US & RU control ME to keep oil prices high and the region controlled; whereas CH relies on US/RU creating failed states so that they can rape the resources, three are #UNSecuriyCounsel
7152 2018-12-02 23:08:27 US still imports over 1/3 of its crude - I’m not buying this story. If not for drop in oil price, CPI would be higher and monetary reset - closer as Fed cannot go Volcker on inflation.
7153 2018-12-02 23:08:17 The claim is extraordinary - close to 100% capture with no energy cost. If it and the other half of the problem - safe and permanent storing works - that could be a silver bullet. Oil companies are incented to sell this though and it needs the deepest scrutiny.
7154 2018-12-02 23:08:16 I put so much castor oil on my lashes that I can barely see oops
7155 2018-12-02 23:08:10 While boiling myself in a hot epsom salt/ rosemary oil bath, I spy this intriguing rosemary-egg idea. Oh the irony!
7156 2018-12-02 23:08:08 #Crude oil WTI futures open up ~3% at $52.40. Risky assets are green across the board. #OOTT
7157 2018-12-02 23:07:53 @askslim /QM - E-mini Light Sweet Crude Oil Futures on the Sunday opening just hit its 5 day high
7158 2018-12-02 23:07:50 And yes. Chávez destroyed the second largest oil industry playing that trick. It was the 5th largest producer (of cheap oil) but it was the 2nd largest producer thanks to added value: technology, patents, a massive distribution network in the US,refineries all around the world...
7159 2018-12-02 23:07:33 Congratulations to Brain Deenen on his win today at the Lucus Oil Off Road

Father - Whats that boy? Little Timmys trapped by a giant metal monster?
Flipper - Dolphin noises
Father - Thats an oil rig Flipper. Timmy works there now
Flipper - Dolphin noises
Father - Its been 15 years dude, get over it
Flipper - Dolphin noises :-(
7161 2018-12-02 23:07:30 Imagine if you found a bag of stale, spicy barbecue chips, soaked them in ginger ale and lava soap, then baked the slurry into a loaf with a dash of patchouli oil. That is roughly what Trader Joe's Gingerbread Crisps taste like. Avoid.
7162 2018-12-02 23:07:26 @JKhashoggi   Why do Americans need Saudi oil this way, can't they just deal with someone else until the king does something about his mentally unstable son.

7164 2018-12-02 23:07:11 I’m a powerline technician who has worked all over Alberta and NWT (including a stint at an oil sands mine). I find nothing wrong with having this conversation.
7165 2018-12-02 23:07:11 We all know that if she had implemented anything of the sort, she would have been criticized for “regulating a free market” and “attempting to kill the oil investment.” There is no right answer for the UCP, they will oppose for the sake of being obstinate.
7166 2018-12-02 23:07:11 Obviously Mr. Rea is driving back from the airport after returning from 6 weeks offshore on an oil rig. It’s the only explanation for the extent of his excitement.

Leaving a 9-5 shift wouldn’t elicit such unbridled joy, even at Christmas.
7167 2018-12-02 23:07:09 I've been happy in the past with essential oils from an online retailer called Mountain Rose Herb.
I just took a fresh smell of the eucalyptus oil and it definitely has similar notes to menthol. I bet the molecules have similar structure.
7168 2018-12-02 23:07:07 I’m interested..
In the powder and oil Qun
7169 2018-12-02 23:07:04 If it only smells like oil for a week, your friend must clean a lot more thoroughly that we do. It's more like a month (and I don't really mind all that much anyways)...

7173 2018-12-02 23:06:52 War for oil
7174 2018-12-02 23:06:49 This is fakenews. CNN doesn't know the difference between cheap oil and cheaper oil.
NO ONE at CNN knows what it's like to struggle with heating their home or filling up a tank of gas every week to go to work. Cheaper oil is very good for the American middle/working class. #MAGA
7175 2018-12-02 23:06:49 I'm making steaks, broccoli, baked potato and bread with olive oil, seasonings and cheese. Chef bud is here 
7176 2018-12-02 23:06:36 I really need some CBD Gummies to help with my depression and back pain..  Never tried the oil hear it works better.....

7179 2018-12-02 23:06:11 The palm oil industry is cashed up & corrupting governments & authorities, & maybe others (??). We cannot allow this evil industry to increase its power & stranglehold on land usage in Sumatra, Borneo, PNG, West Papua, Solomon Islands, Congo. I’m boycotting palm oil myself.

These are just a few.
7184 2018-12-02 23:05:47 I’ve been gone from Oxford since Friday. Returned less than 10 minutes ago and my mood is already rank! I need some sage & anointing oil to cleanse myself from whatever foolishness sits over this damn town.
7185 2018-12-02 23:05:40 If you just put oil on the wax it comes right off
7186 2018-12-02 23:05:34 Oil money well spent
7187 2018-12-02 23:05:31 Westminster has had over £4 Trillion from oil since the 1960s and there is still a lot of oil that is why Scotland must control the revenue for the generations to come
7188 2018-12-02 23:05:31 It's not about the price of oil, it's about the insane taxes that Macron is placing on gas.
7189 2018-12-02 23:05:28 Gel nails are an alternative but they’re similar to acrylics. Same with dipping.  If you want your nails to grow use cuticle oil daily and several times a day and always wear polish.
7190 2018-12-02 23:05:21 So you don't think when renewable energy goes into full effect it will effect the middle east... whose wealth comes from oil?  I mean really?  "nuts"  What is really nuts is NEOM - Saudi Arabia's new start up.
7191 2018-12-02 23:05:21 YES! Lets hope it holds!!

7196 2018-12-02 23:04:57 @ryantannehill1 Another bad team game and horrible offensive play calling.  How did the Guru Dial up 150 yards of offense.  Why don’t you check out of those run plays when 8-9 men are stacked in the box?  Oil it down, play action.  Gase is going to ruin your carrer.
7197 2018-12-02 23:04:52 what essential oil do I buy to get more money?
7198 2018-12-02 23:04:49 Gotta go buy more chili oil at the store! We're all out....again. >_>"
7199 2018-12-02 23:04:41 Why does your Tesla need an oil change?
7200 2018-12-02 23:04:33 Yeah you need to stop using grease lmfao that’s gonna clog your pores that’s why you wanna wash it everyday. Use oil.
7201 2018-12-02 23:04:33 My car needs oil.
7202 2018-12-02 23:04:18 The stock market is slowly going bull again, but since the oil crisis and China tariffs are going on it's pretty difficult to predict where the market is going to go
7203 2018-12-02 23:03:55 Try CBD oil. Go natural.
7204 2018-12-02 23:03:50 Just ran out of oil making latkes. Hope the Stop &Shop supply hasn't been desecrated. #happyhanukkah
7205 2018-12-02 23:03:26 Hi Santa Cruz. 

We have to talk.

Yes, I know that you're happy it's legal.

But not EVERYTHING needs to have cannabis oil.

Yours,
Chip.
7206 2018-12-02 23:03:22 You're trying to draw some sort of equivalence between an existential fight against Nazi fascism in Europe and an illegal blood for oil war against an impotent country degraded by a decade of sanctions in the Middle East? That's a feckin weak argument imho
7207 2018-12-02 23:03:19 Ok. Smoke oil then. It’s all good 
7208 2018-12-02 23:03:18 Oil and a facephuusay
7209 2018-12-02 23:03:17 Man this oil change done snuck up on me 
7210 2018-12-02 23:03:16 @contactcaffeine Hey guys I bought some of ur soap at MFF cause it smelled freaking amazing!! But I saw you use palm oil in ur products and you probably understand I'm a bit worried about encouraging the palm oil industry. Is your palm oil source ethical? Thank you!
7211 2018-12-02 23:03:13 Wow it’s amazing the difference putting in oil and stuff makes for your car

7215 2018-12-02 23:02:47 I was mixing oils tea tree, castor oil and coconut oil
7216 2018-12-02 23:02:44 so the oil and gas industry is now "supporters of the democrats"? sounds about right
7217 2018-12-02 23:02:42 Passed a car on a highway today with an enormous menorah on the roof and "Happy Hanukkah" written on it. I wonder how often it needs oil changes.

7223 2018-12-02 23:02:22 Makes sense. After all, they want us to go back to the days of the oil lamp.
7224 2018-12-02 23:02:02 9. Olive oil - olive oil contains monounsaturated fatty acids. It helps reduce the risk of heart disease and maintains cholesterol levels.
7225 2018-12-02 23:02:01 honey oil hits outta a vape pen 
7226 2018-12-02 23:01:57 Obviously he nor any of the others who want to abandon our oil and gas industry have any idea of the myriad of supporting industries and businesses that would also be shut down. Time for him to learn these things before he speaks and sounds foolish.

7231 2018-12-02 23:01:37 Venezuela implemented changes which were very radical, pushing social Democratic policies to their limit, sadly things have gone wrong there partly because of imperialism, oil price collapse but also mistakes of their own making.  Cuba of course continues to inspire
7232 2018-12-02 23:01:35 The things that brought down oil are now no longer a barrier. Oil and oil stocks can all rise now assuming the SP500 rises too.
7233 2018-12-02 23:01:26 I just throw an entire bottle of oil in my hair 
7234 2018-12-02 23:01:22 George Bush Snr has died and people are giving it the "Aww that's sad". No, no... he wasn't a nice bloke. He started a war bc he wanted oil and then his son made 9/11 happen to start the Gulf War 2. Fucking minging family.

7259 2018-12-02 22:59:26 Can't believe the @realDonaldTrump  still denies the Saudi prince has anything to do with the killing of the #KashoggiMurder . FFS man, they funded the  actions  that flew into your towers . Do something about it whilst you have chance coz oil won't be around for ever!
7260 2018-12-02 22:59:15 Take you chart into Alberta and show it to all of those unemployed oil workers and their families . I am sure they will offer you an old fashioned Alberta Merry Christmas ,,one that you won't soon forget
7261 2018-12-02 22:59:12 Honey oil co is good too
7262 2018-12-02 22:59:06 Oil is pretty valuable. You have entire political party fighting for it.
7263 2018-12-02 22:59:06 Oil with bread is totally Italian and that means popery
7264 2018-12-02 22:58:54 During past admins., tuwing Dec. nagtataas ang

ang demand sa mga malalamig na bansa.
7265 2018-12-02 22:58:42 Depending on how long he was down he may want a more intimate dinner. Something home cooked with family. Maybe a bag full of his hygiene stuff like deodorant, beards oil, mens body wash, electric razor...ect. Oh & a “ready” bedroom.
7266 2018-12-02 22:58:23 Don't forget, once the sanctions we're lifted, Rex Tillerson and his buddies at Exxon could buy that $500 billion in oil from Putin, and the Russian economy would improve over night.
7267 2018-12-02 22:58:18 That shit don’t work for me lmao  I gotta use the oil.
7268 2018-12-02 22:58:14 So after week of being lazy to cook... I made wild caught salmon seasoned with fresh garlic, soy sauce, & sesame oil. Side of white rice & avocado #healthymeal #dinnertime 
7269 2018-12-02 22:57:55 You should be burnt out from fighting tooth and nail since the day our Antiochus ascended to the throne, your inner fire snuffed out. But you are sustained like the miracle of the oil. You are the light that continues to shine and drive out the darkness. Chanukah sameach! 
7270 2018-12-02 22:57:51 Big oil is self sustaining on its own. Those gove subsidies are there to bring in the oil companies and gets it all back in taxes, jobs etc. The only solar companies that are around depend on gove subsidies and money to keep going. Bringing in no actual value. Huge difference
7271 2018-12-02 22:57:47 NYC is a textbook example of how the war against Big Oil gives bad politicians an out from actual action on climate change. Deblasio is a disgrace on low carbon transport, but gets street cred for suing Exxon. It’s honestly the most pathetic story in climate right now.
7272 2018-12-02 22:57:33 really,how about this,,learn to live with what you have just like the working poor,,,,,,,or how about this,let the big oil billioniares  pay for it
7273 2018-12-02 22:57:33 I love the smell of motor oil
7274 2018-12-02 22:57:25 Argan oil for hair 
7275 2018-12-02 22:57:23 While waiting for my laundry, I got an oil change, new air filters, windshield wipers, and added air to my tires. Really productive stuff.
7276 2018-12-02 22:57:12 Never ever will have something like Anfield nights and will never have something as special as Istanbul. Somehow all that oil money has yet to get you NEAR a champions league title. We made it there with karius in goal.
7277 2018-12-02 22:56:50 death-cross retest ... Been saying won't go to 2820 again ... for pure RETEST... EURUSD down, DXY going higher 51 PMI in Australia, now Chinese PMI, Korean and US ... Due to oil collapse those ISMs should go much lower, not like -0.5 or so...
7278 2018-12-02 22:56:42 heyci got the oil
7279 2018-12-02 22:56:41 Now that just shows how uniformed you are . The oil comes out of the ground and then is refined for different purposes . Read a book

7281 2018-12-02 22:56:29 tarte’s rainforest of the sea is what my best friend swears by, i loved the look of the it cosmetics CC cream but it broke me out (every foundation does tho), and i’ve heard great things about the josie maran argan oil foundation if you’re more dry than oily!
7282 2018-12-02 22:56:05 Low oil prices does affect rig counts in American oil production which has absolutely put a HUGH crimp in OPEC. US oil dominance is essential to maintain a market influence. Perhaps lower oil prices can help US oil companies find cheaper, even more efficient production methods.
7283 2018-12-02 22:56:03 Peel and grate four potatos and an onion. Mix in two whole eggs, 1 tsp. Salt, and 1/2 cup flour. Fry in about 2 mm of light oil like canola or sunflower. Super easy and amazing.
7284 2018-12-02 22:56:02 Imagine that one scientist who is climate denier runs a for profit company receiving money from oil industry, and also sits on gov panel making climate policy. What would be your reaction?
7285 2018-12-02 22:55:53 Lavender on my lower tummy for menstrual cramps!!!!! Swear by it. Eucalyptus oil in shower for better breathing and stress

7290 2018-12-02 22:55:31 Finally bought me some fucking castor oil bitch so when you finally see my luscious full ass eyebrows COMPLIMENT THEM
7291 2018-12-02 22:55:19 Yeah. It’s almost like something catastrophic happened: like the global price of oil dropping from $120 to $30 per barrel. Either you think Albertans are really stupid...or you’re stupid yourself. Either option is pretty troubling.
7292 2018-12-02 22:55:12 call for　～を呼び求める、必要とする

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
7293 2018-12-02 22:55:08 Decades of noise, pollution more pavement pkg/oil leaks, spills, drive in everythings, millions of deaths/injuries + huge #social #health #infrastructure costs $TRILLIONS
7294 2018-12-02 22:54:56 well he did strike oil on the 12th hole while golfing.
7295 2018-12-02 22:54:55 ye syes you should i love their vids. especially oil acrobatics :)
7296 2018-12-02 22:54:51 Oil change and nails and feet is next on my list
7297 2018-12-02 22:54:45 Why? Weapons test?radiactivce material plastic?oil?
7298 2018-12-02 22:54:38 Brilliant playlist, good mix of old & new. Liked all The Goon Sax tracks, RBCF, That Petrol Emotion. Some of my favourite classics too from Hüsker Dü, Fugazi, Go-Betweens, Afghan Whigs, Midnight Oil & New Order.
7299 2018-12-02 22:54:00 Not to mention that corporations don't pay tax. Their customers do.
Put a tax on an oil company and all you'll see is a price rise at the pump, but then given governments then tax that price increase the government's winning all the way.
"Let them eat cake." Macron (probably)
7300 2018-12-02 22:53:52 It seems you have taken his comments out of context. However, another point: as long as bombs are exploded, guns kill in wars over oil and land, planes, ships, drones &tanks service wars, trucks carry soldiers to die,etc,does recycling garbage help our world?No.We create fossils.
7301 2018-12-02 22:53:50 How much oil are you putting in each cup Max? Not supposed to fill it.
7302 2018-12-02 22:53:42 In the summer my skin gets super oily & it works perfectly. I need the lotion+ for the winter but since I ran out of it, I’m using the gel which definitely dries it out. I just mix it with almond oil for now & it isn’t too bad.
7303 2018-12-02 22:53:40 thank you
7304 2018-12-02 22:53:37 Ameen thumma Ameen!
7305 2018-12-02 22:53:31 Is that the two liter? Cause I feel your pain. I had to buy oil by the case, and was told the consumption was “normal”.
7306 2018-12-02 22:53:28 Roll up! Roll up! Get your best #Brexit snake oil here! Don't be fooled by inferior #NoDeal or #Remain options! Unrepeatable offer! Buy now! Everything must go!
7307 2018-12-02 22:53:12 damn I hate when my house smells lile birth olive oil
7308 2018-12-02 22:53:11 me works for 6 hours on errands & HW, 
6 hours later: how the fuck am i tired ? wtf?
7309 2018-12-02 22:53:07 All Trump cares about is oil
7310 2018-12-02 22:52:53 I think I would oil up some railroad tracks suggestively tbh in true power bottom form - what about yours?
7311 2018-12-02 22:52:43 So what happened was people were hoarding stashes of oil & secretly refilled the lamp when no one was looking. It was like an early version of Three’s Company?
7312 2018-12-02 22:52:42 A shrink or someone who can explain the most rudimentary aspects of valve-unsticking? I wiped clean. I reapplied oil. And still I have failed.
7313 2018-12-02 22:52:41 Castor oil!!!
7314 2018-12-02 22:52:35 น่ารัก
7315 2018-12-02 22:52:21 Don’t forget also, lifted sanctions would mean oil grabbing
7316 2018-12-02 22:52:21 Hot oil > Hot sauce.
7317 2018-12-02 22:52:19 it took me awhile
I accepted the fact that ive lost my mind
7318 2018-12-02 22:52:14 ครับ
7319 2018-12-02 22:52:13 Jo: may baby oil ka?
Me: baby lang
HAHAHAHAHAH jk wala den pala
7320 2018-12-02 22:51:58 ครับ
7321 2018-12-02 22:51:56 Yes, predatory pricing. This is a common occurrence in commodity mkts when delivery & storage capacity are constrained. Nothing special about oil.
As to Asian mkts, that's what Trans Mtn is supposed to be for. The alt is rail. Ask Lac Megantic about the safety of that.
7322 2018-12-02 22:51:51 One of the main issues with Venezuela most its economy was driven on oil exportation.  The corruption of government, over-spending going into massive debt, and a lack of tax revenue all lead to Venezuela's current situation. US is on similar paths with spending though..
7323 2018-12-02 22:51:48 I can always grow it again, and actually take care of it proper next time. More time I just left it in braided(didn’t even oil it ). I miss short hair! We’ll see tho
7324 2018-12-02 22:51:37 Easy stuff here: Sacraments: Eucharist: Body, blood, soul & divinity.  Marriage: Man, woman, God.  Holy Orders: The call, priest/bishop/deacon, H.S.  Baptism: See above.  Healing: Sick person, priest/bishop, oil, H.S.. ..Different aspects (functions) under each of 7 Sacraments.
7325 2018-12-02 22:51:37 Really Jacob really maybe if you had worked harder increased productivity and training you wouldn’t have to pay as much tax. Or if the thatch had done what the Norwegians had and saved that North Sea oil money and created a wealth fund we could have lowered taxes
7326 2018-12-02 22:51:34 Goldman is losing money in the oil market , so they are trying to get investors back in for higher oil prices. This Ii a smoke screen . We are over supplied
7327 2018-12-02 22:51:27 So this laughter is "we are pumping no more oil" and watch how the price sky-rockets"
7328 2018-12-02 22:51:25 These hoes really made pancakes with CANNABIS OIL and I’m pissed.
7329 2018-12-02 22:51:22 I've been painting all day with oil paintings and turpentine I'm going insane send help
7330 2018-12-02 22:51:20 You have to have her fart into the water chamber. The alternative is creating an essential oil from her feaces but I know you're a busy man.
7331 2018-12-02 22:51:18 Continued oil & gas exploration industry must be stopped by any means necessary. They are earth killers. They will mine humanity to the death.
7332 2018-12-02 22:51:08 Happy #Hanukkah to our Jewish brothers and sisters! May your CBD oil that only should last  one night last eight! Keep the bush burning!
7333 2018-12-02 22:51:06 Where have you been the past 3 1/2 years? Now there is an election coming & you are all fired up? You, maam, are a hypocrite of the highest degree! You run your mouth about how bad oil is & force a carbon tax on ALL ALBERTANS then say you are fighting for pipelines?
7334 2018-12-02 22:51:02 I agree. The price of cbd will drop significantly within 6 months of hemp becoming legal because anybody can and will grow it. Margins will dramatically decrease.  The Great Value CBD be sitting right next to the fish oil at Walmart.

7336 2018-12-02 22:50:56 sleep !!! rest !!! drink some throat tea w lemon and honey and wrap yourself in a blanket and stay warm !! oregano oil is gross but effective !! this'll pass soon 
7337 2018-12-02 22:50:40 I agreed with @51Prentice ..
Cheaper oil means cheaper gas which means my paycheck goes Alot further......
7338 2018-12-02 22:50:36 I better oil these hinges 
Be making too much noise
7339 2018-12-02 22:50:21 I understand parents of Scottish students. Scotland doesn’t have enough money like in Norway as the oil money here has been pillaged by WM! #indyref2
7340 2018-12-02 22:50:21 Amento, @AugiesCoffee if he used a fever tonic and garnished he acknowledges he won't get man points. lol.

7345 2018-12-02 22:49:34 I like to think that’s true...but things are dim and we’re almost out of oil.
7346 2018-12-02 22:49:28 if it like the oil sanctions then company will boost production
and then fine out they have tariffs
7347 2018-12-02 22:49:24 Are you high posing this right now? I mean really? So all the worlds scientists are all in together for what purpose? What is the endgame to climate change being acknowledged and accepted by the GOP? Trump is already enriching the GOP and oil companies.

7351 2018-12-02 22:49:03 Canada oil and gas regulation standards are the highest in the world. Bi-annual Global petroleum showcase Canadian expertise.  A lot of the Canadian oil & gas experts around the globe come from Canada.

☆Avacado oil

7353 2018-12-02 22:48:58 Yes.  Cannabis oil applied to your vulva 45 mins before sex will def enhance your sexual experience. (proven on numerous occasions by Mrs Ygk).
7354 2018-12-02 22:48:57 [1] I think when this semester finishes up for me, I'll make some posts showing the art I worked on for class. I've also been working on multiple oil paintings that are - NOT GONNA LIE - taking me forever. And are due in two weeks by finals. 

I love/hate oil paint.

7356 2018-12-02 22:48:51 Everyone is telling you to use toothpaste and baking soda or tea tree oil. I'm going to suggest another method which is manuka honey. It will clear up the pimple and/or reduce it in size very fast
7357 2018-12-02 22:48:50 @BillCunninghamS I can’t buy buy CBD oil in Ohio. What do you recommend
7358 2018-12-02 22:48:47 On top of all of that, he wanna blame the CANOLA OIL for fucking up his chicken.. NAH SIS!!! YOU fucked up your own damn chicken. Over it
7359 2018-12-02 22:48:40 Such polite Canadians... even when they're trolling. <3

7360 2018-12-02 22:48:27 Tonight remember the story of the Maccabees.  It is not just about finding enough oil to light the eternal light in the Temple.  It is also the story of the resistance that led up to it. Resistance does not have to be violent, only effective. Happy Chanukah 
7361 2018-12-02 22:48:19 Try olive oil and a wash cloth

7364 2018-12-02 22:48:00 damn i keep forgetting to get my oil changed  bouta push it till next weekend again 
7365 2018-12-02 22:47:59 Aye bruh... i smell really good. My new deodorant,  body oil combo i got going right now... 
7366 2018-12-02 22:47:52 btw I finally went long oil Friday after being bearish all year.  I was expecting China to buy more goods after cutting back past couple of months. It's not a huge position though.
7367 2018-12-02 22:47:50 Hmm. Hard choice. I got lots of things i could get her. New clothes that will fit and she can wear for her photo shots, New oil for her skin. Some make up maby and a podium, there sh can stand as she is being admire by everyone
7368 2018-12-02 22:47:45 No surprise...Big oil is part of the 1% that believe Democracy, is a threat to Capitalism.

7373 2018-12-02 22:47:14 The Saudi’s do not believe in human rights, they know that the greed for oil will allow the west to turn a blind eye. End the arms agreement, stop buying their oil. They are murderers and need to be held accountable
7374 2018-12-02 22:47:04 Baldy needs more oil
7375 2018-12-02 22:46:52 I believe this is also a tax on heating oil.

7381 2018-12-02 22:46:04 Since it was my first time I just finished them with a slight bit of olive oil, garlic, and sea salt. But I now have an idea for a full meal where they will play a feature role.

7383 2018-12-02 22:45:56 I just ripped such a fat snort on my olbas oil stick that my vision went white and I was fully blind for 15 seconds
7384 2018-12-02 22:45:56 saw on the tv in the breakroom that notley had some big announcement and i thought she was going to be announcing the date for the next election, but it turns out it was something about oil production, or pipelines, or rail transportation or something. i do not care about oil -_-
7385 2018-12-02 22:45:51 hi which brand of oil paints is the best to use for portraits
7386 2018-12-02 22:45:47 Oreos and Nutella contain palm oil, an industry that is destroying ecosystems like the habitat of super cool yet enigmatic orangutans and other things 2018 has ruined for me

I have decent credentials
7387 2018-12-02 22:45:39 U understand our problem in US. Government breaking their laws that protect our #wildhorses -selling them 2 slaughter. Supplies the world w/horsemeat 4 profit. All 4 more cattle & oil. They hope 2 restart horse #Slaughterhouse in US AGAIN. Brutal round-ups, killing w/no mercy
7388 2018-12-02 22:45:39 I just gave my cat her first dose of CBD oil for her arthritis. Fingers crossed it gives her some relief. 
7389 2018-12-02 22:45:21 Crazy coincidence that we saw same performance night. It WAS unbelievably prescient. The speech re giving away ourselves to the screen even more poignant in light of Facebook scandals.Sadly rant about “Arab” oil was not so anachronistic either, even with all that has changed.
7390 2018-12-02 22:45:17 False.
We supported Saddam, funding his war with Iran.
We then lied about Iraqi forces about to attack KSA.
We attacked.
We also set up a big military presence in KSA.
We then set up Oil for Food.
Bin Laden used this as basis for Fatah against the US.
7391 2018-12-02 22:45:11 people how stund cab you be no matter how you transport this massive volume of oil your going have spills rail pipelines or tanker's Here is your problem all you cluster fucks after it happens have no definitive way of cleaning it up of late example NF others numerous pipe lines
7392 2018-12-02 22:44:59 About time! He’s a criminal and his BS was involved with Chaney back when President Bush was President, in an attempt to get some land (not exactly sure where it was) that was very rich with oil,I think was the driving force!
7393 2018-12-02 22:44:54 Alaska is funded by oil. I see 2 major problems. Who pays into a fund and who get something out of it. Cui Bono
7394 2018-12-02 22:44:51 Made palm oil rice for the first time today. Quite happy with how it came out 
7395 2018-12-02 22:44:43 @Marla_CWF Hi Marla, would you be available this evening to be an analyst for our coverage of Rachel Notley's announcement on a potential oil cut? Please let me know. Brittany.rosen@Citytv.rogers.com
7396 2018-12-02 22:44:39 Maybe it depends on what the nail is made of and/or whether they were coating nails with oil back in the day.
7397 2018-12-02 22:44:39 Renews are killing birds & need fossil backup due to their unreliability (no wind, no sun). All excess power from them is either grounded, or sold at a loss. Oil is organic, mining may be dirty, but the actual product is clean.
7398 2018-12-02 22:44:37 girl I was legit freaking out and he asked if I ever check that. I was like oh no the only thing I check is the oil and tires lmao
7399 2018-12-02 22:44:34 Boycott products made with Palm Oil.
7400 2018-12-02 22:44:20 What percentage of Scotland’s economy is the fishing industry compared to say Financial Services? You should be fighting for passporting rights, not focussing on one small part of the offshore fishing industry. We’re more than just fish & oil you know.
7401 2018-12-02 22:44:19 A twist? How about making apple fritters for dessert? It uses... OIL! And potatoes are “POMMES de terre” in French; apples are “pomme”. It’s meant to be!
7402 2018-12-02 22:44:10 That's what we get for taking the oil out of the ground that was lubing them ;)
7403 2018-12-02 22:43:59 Allah yamasa rahama
7404 2018-12-02 22:43:57 We could have done with a few vanity projects in Scotland if only we had access to our oil wealth. WM instead decimated Scotlands industries. We had young people immigrating to find work. He has a nerve to say we owe WM money. They could not pay us back the money they stole.

7406 2018-12-02 22:43:51 give me coffee or give me cookies made with coconut oil, I'm gonna take a nap on my floor.
7407 2018-12-02 22:43:51 Happy Hannukah, in which an interesting siege was successfully defended against, but history collectively decides to celebrate the guy who was really bad at measuring how long oil is supposed to burn for instead.
7408 2018-12-02 22:43:42 well, it’s been real. until next time, stay dirty oil city

7410 2018-12-02 22:43:34 our First Nations communities are in pain, no clean drinking water in most, Veterans living in tents on our streets, our borders open to illegal migrants, jobs leaving Canada by the 1000s, money to Hama supporting groups, our oil industry is in the toilet because of him. Not good
7411 2018-12-02 22:43:26 Well at least you aren’t giving away 50 million this fine Sunday.  Oh ya that was your Dick head boss.  And good news I think you have finally crippled the oil patch enough the NDP is going to finish it off.
7412 2018-12-02 22:43:23 Earlier today, i posted an oil on canvas portrait of President Bush (41) on a public Facebook group called "Modern art 20th century".
The comments -- some civil, some not -- were nevertheless, mind blowing.
My post ended up being deleted, and the ADMIN still hasn't responded why.

7414 2018-12-02 22:43:20 I could visit every region of earth and never be over the phrase “rapeseed oil”
7415 2018-12-02 22:43:10 Which one sentence would define your parenting style?

I think mine would be "put Tea Tree Oil on that".
7416 2018-12-02 22:43:07 ever got boiling hot oil in your eye? i have
7417 2018-12-02 22:42:49 All for that sweet, sweet oil. And because the Soviet Union collapse and we didn't have to worry about the Middle East following to those god-damned commies. It's clear he's trolling he likes Assad apologists.
7418 2018-12-02 22:42:43 What were the "miracles"? I was taught in Sunday school it was the miracle of the oil lasting eight nights.  Were there some other miracles I missed?
7419 2018-12-02 22:42:41 It’s almost as if @CNN has an agenda. Or are their reporters so ignorant and incompetent that they have no idea that the price of oil is plummeting? Do they do anything right? @CNN is a joke. Perfect place for that idiot @Acosta
7420 2018-12-02 22:42:35 I also want to throw away every lotion I own because I’m married to the coconut oil now
7421 2018-12-02 22:42:14 I use peppermint oil (diluted) for migraines and headaches.
7422 2018-12-02 22:42:13 おっぱい！
7423 2018-12-02 22:42:09 I’m really scared to use castor oil as lax but also really excited to see if it works as well as everyone says it does...... this bitch just wants to be empty
7424 2018-12-02 22:42:08 Over my years of taking the Greyhound Bus from Montreal to Calgary and later years Vancouver, cannot give the number over the years of men I met, also taking the bus either back home to Maritimes/ NFL. They worked in mostly Fort McMurry oil fields. They would go to oil fieids..
7425 2018-12-02 22:42:02 Next thing I noticed was I was alone in the kitchen. So I drop the thing I'm throwing away (thick plastic olive oil container, much larger than the normal bottles) & I just full-tilt stomp it in one swoosh of my right leg. Thing didn't even need to compress out air. Sucker burst.

7430 2018-12-02 22:41:46 Why hasn't that pin rusted into the paper or left an oil residue?
7431 2018-12-02 22:41:40 Here is an interesting fact, most countries under US sanctions have fuel shortages. Even oil producers like Venezuela and  Sudan have fuel queues. Lets think deeply about the sanctions while we are in those fuel queues.
7432 2018-12-02 22:41:40 Yes, and no excuses. Just some historical econ context: West Africa (incl Nigeria with oil) started from a much lower econ base & playing catchup. It shows in the education system which is still quite weak unfortunately. Real critique to me is that challenge not grasped
7433 2018-12-02 22:41:32 Lmao if you have to jus make sure you rub him down in coconut oil after lol. The shampoo dries their skin out
7434 2018-12-02 22:41:31 Alberta is being "impatient" while thousands lose their jobs and $80M in oil revenues are being lost? I'll be so glad when Trudeau is just a bad memory.
7435 2018-12-02 22:41:28 Mostly water and a silk scarf. Sometimes @EcocoBeauty gel in Olive Oil.
7436 2018-12-02 22:41:24 But Trump asked the Saudis to drop oil prices explicitly, and let them get away with murder. What gives?
7437 2018-12-02 22:41:23 We don’t want to start going yet, but keep the oil in the engine
7438 2018-12-02 22:41:22 Energy East would be a win. Canada would be a lot less reliant on Dictatorship oil from Countries that fund terror groups, kill journalist, rape women, starve children and kill their own people. Canadian oil fuelling Eastern Canada. A Real Win For The Country, a win for All

7447 2018-12-02 22:40:45 I use Biore charcoal exfoliating mask and their face wash in the shower. My post shower routine is toner, I spritz my face with a cucumber mist, moisturizer, and then I use a little bit of oil (Tea Tree, Olive, or Coconut) to help seal the moisture in.
7448 2018-12-02 22:40:43 still cant believe i woke up today and all i really wanted in life was a toast with olive oil
7449 2018-12-02 22:40:41 Agreed. #DontChoke is a nice idea by state owned oil company Neste to save the planet but eat smarter, more sustainably, locally. (and if a certain basketball player cared so much about saving the planet he wouldn't have had a kid!)
7450 2018-12-02 22:40:31 I use jojoba and sweet almond oil and occasionally Jamaican black castor oil and my mom is always complaining about a smell. Like sis the only one that smells is JBC and even then unless you put your fuckinf nose to my hair you’re not going to smell it

7455 2018-12-02 22:40:20 The only thing Alberta needs is money to retrain into clean energy jobs.  Anything else is a waste of time as whether they like it or not the world is transitioning away from oil and it couldn’t happen fast enough.
7456 2018-12-02 22:40:16 When 10% of our Alaska legislators where popped by the fbi for selling their votes to oil companies I was more offended by how cheap they sold out. The shock was we could have had a bake sale and bought them.

7458 2018-12-02 22:40:08 Regarding the oil incident, he also stated, “I swear when I die, all my life insurance money will be spent putting new motors in all these damn cars because none of you check your damn oil.”

Trust me you don't want it...
Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar perhaps?
7463 2018-12-02 22:39:40 Because at first the complaints were that the oil is being taxed higher (now if you just want to make a full twice a month, it is equivalent to a full month of pay at the end of the year). So to symbolize the complaints people used their safery vests
7464 2018-12-02 22:39:40 I don't think the Oil & Gas capital of of Europe will be "below the salt". Whatever that means.

7468 2018-12-02 22:39:32 On the time scale required (5s of years), advocating for switch to EVs has the best shot at producing the necessary carbon reductions. Price on carbon would be a very useful tool to accelerate this switch and in that debate the oil industry is worth attacking.
7469 2018-12-02 22:39:16 Without oil money you’d be nothing, still haven’t accomplished much in your small pathetic history
7470 2018-12-02 22:39:10 I was thinking I hadn't heard him in a while. Selling snake oil now.
7471 2018-12-02 22:39:06 “Stretch that oil” should be a thing said at Hanukkah from now on.
7472 2018-12-02 22:38:50 Sorry just one more reply. We need to hold the large Norwegian oil company Equinor to account, they're global and plan on increasing drilling in 2019 both on land and in the Arctic, and in effect greenwash the whole country of Norway
7473 2018-12-02 22:38:46 you may need to try different oil treatments we’re not white
7474 2018-12-02 22:38:41 Someone should prolly mention the 20% drop in oil prices the last month
7475 2018-12-02 22:38:39 I once had a twitter exchange with the head of an oil company sympathising re fracking - but as soon as I told him I was a climate sceptic - it stopped.

Oil companies just don't want to know sceptics.

7482 2018-12-02 22:38:10 I literally just ate a tablespoon of coconut oil. Stupid keto diet. I needed more fat 
7483 2018-12-02 22:38:06 Some oil bosses, maybe?
7484 2018-12-02 22:37:51 Alan has blocked me so that he can no longer be refuted. That is what snake oil salesmen do. They ignore counterpoints to their pseudo science.
7485 2018-12-02 22:37:51 It's kind of a pathetic miracle too. Wow, we thought we'd run out of oil, but there was enough! I'll bet the priests sneaked it in when no one was looking.
7486 2018-12-02 22:37:39 If he got the frozen ones maybe, but oil is traditional, so... 
on the other hand it's Bridge...
7487 2018-12-02 22:37:37 Shit I thought my dad was gonna whoop my ass all the way back to 1993 when he saw my car needed a quart of oil. 
7488 2018-12-02 22:37:27 Oil is literally the remains of the dead.
7489 2018-12-02 22:37:25 Grocery shopping on Sundays: when you hear people say "all done except and oil with a high smoke point...do they put those on the bottle?" 
7490 2018-12-02 22:37:18 Not paying attention and splashed oil all over it
7491 2018-12-02 22:37:15 I didn't say that we don't buy foreign oil,  genius.  We buy it because it's cheap. We do not need it.
7492 2018-12-02 22:36:58 So u r saying that Obama got us more dependent on Oil.....?
7493 2018-12-02 22:36:52 Jerry Brown, Gavin, California Dems&Repubs signed to happen to California with fires of DEW, Haarp, Alaskan quake land grabbing for oil & etc. Fracking the hell out of Mother earth while playing God w/ Mother nature. Crimes for a dynasty & federal grant raping from We the people
7494 2018-12-02 22:36:51 We don't have an oil crisis, @EvanLSolomon, but we do have #housingCrises and an #opioidCrisis.

Your show gives no coverage to the housing and opioid crises and lots of coverage to oil.

Oil is killing our planet.   The crisis is not shutting down the tarsands. #cdnpoli
7495 2018-12-02 22:36:48 Bruhhhhhhhh this body oil >>>>>>>
7496 2018-12-02 22:36:42 And u actually think oil, whisky our world renowned food industry. Then there's our exports which are the highest in the UK that are also not attributed to our Scottish economy! And now the yoons are putting union jacks on Scottish produce, the saltire on food sigifies NO GMO
7497 2018-12-02 22:36:41 Okay so it was a poorly crafted joke because I don’t actually fry anything lol I do use olive oil with the seasoning for my grilled chicken though
7498 2018-12-02 22:36:29 I want the pipeline personally. Safer than rail that’s for sure. Not to mention we are burning fuel to rail fuel. Ridiculous at best. We need to expand our options AND deal with our oil as well right now.
7499 2018-12-02 22:36:24 Corporations abusing conservatives, treating customers as though they are employees.. Time to protect free speech, and consider breaking up modern monopolies, which are far more powerful than any 19th century steel or oil companies..
7500 2018-12-02 22:36:15 Oil market price has dropped 20% in the last 2 months.
7501 2018-12-02 22:36:04 U.S. companies with an existing presence in Russia include, PepsiCo, Procter&Gamble, McDonald’s, Mondelez International, General Motors, Johnson & Johnson, Cargill, Alcoa, and General Electric. GE recently signed a joint venture with oil firm Rosneft.
7502 2018-12-02 22:36:00 Oil painting is definitely an inspiration of mine when it comes to the look of love to achieve eventually with my digital art. 

Did you ever post pics of your oil paintings? I’d love to see them.
7503 2018-12-02 22:35:53 I like Superdrug own brand beard oil. It is the bollocks. That is all.

7507 2018-12-02 22:35:43 Well yes, there was a time when it was good for economic growth. But the current oil market is trending on Trump's watch and so it's bad for the economy.  Or so sez the CNN Political Party.

7514 2018-12-02 22:34:33 Oil will go up it may be a slow process...People have been so hurt that they want to see inventories go down first.
7515 2018-12-02 22:34:32 The big joke amongst sceptics when (if) we meet is "has the oil money come through".

I've never seen any evidence or even a vague hint that oil companies ever funded sceptics.

The closest is a coal mine owner who clearly like so might fund some Texas conservaties.

Take responsibility 4 the mess u created Jason Kenney. Now other politicians have to clean up your mess!!
7521 2018-12-02 22:33:48 So no oil?
7522 2018-12-02 22:33:44 Hi Chigrl, any comments about the Oil open?
7523 2018-12-02 22:33:44 It looks almost greasy. Do they excrete some sort of oil thru their skin?
7524 2018-12-02 22:33:30 Oil is never gonna run out
7525 2018-12-02 22:33:29 Predatory pricing? Bull!  Nobody is forcing today’s Transmountain pipeline users to sell >99% of their oil to the U.S. at ~$10 a barrel. There’s no gun to their head to sell cheap. If the “Asian market” exists and pays better, then why aren’t they selling there today?
7526 2018-12-02 22:33:22 somebody tell these idiots oil is at $50 per barrel, & gas before taxes is about $1.40 a gallon, the violence in Paris is because global tool little boy macron agreed to the UN tax scheme

7532 2018-12-02 22:32:15 As I have learned more and questioned more the reality is Chanukah no matter how you slice it is actually Jews being influenced by cultures around them. The book of Macabee's make no mention of the miracle of oil and why would the real Menotrah (in the temple) be lit in December

7535 2018-12-02 22:31:58 Rio Tinto's $3.5 billion Koodaideri iron ore mine is a welcome investment in WA, but it ain't no boom
During the height of the mining boom, there were six major oil and gas projects and several large iron ore mines being developed simultaneously.
7536 2018-12-02 22:31:49 Oh, would he only help big pharma and big oil if he got elected as well? yeah, big pass
7537 2018-12-02 22:31:28 It’s funny how oil prices have dropped since the Khashoggi murder. It’s almost as if Saudi Arabia agreed to help Trump with lower oil prices in exchange for Trump’s help in covering up a politically motivated killing.
7538 2018-12-02 22:31:23 there is also Q of China taking over running of MENA, US, & Israel's biggest 'nuclear  port' Haifa, with a new Syrian oil pipeline now set to be detoured into these territories having previously been excluded pre Syrian invasion, all do with division of territories imo?

7545 2018-12-02 22:30:39 Let’s see, and those immigrants fleeing those countries into Europe has caused what?

Immigrants aren’t the problem. 

The USA’s policies of interventionism into oil and resource rich Middle Eastern countries are the problem!
7546 2018-12-02 22:30:38 No. I know that digging up fossil/ sequestered carbon in the form coal-oil-gas then burning it adds new CO2 to the system, raising it from ~285ppm to 412 (and rising) over the last couple hundred years. It’s not rocket science, it’s simple physical science.
7547 2018-12-02 22:30:15 Same logic goes for the oil industry, then? Because I seem to recall decades worth of govt subsidies to get the oilsands flowing in the first place.
7548 2018-12-02 22:29:45 FYI... the first batch of Latkes is in the oil. The first batch is never good. Oil isn’t quite ready yet. The 2nd and 3rd, those are money.
7549 2018-12-02 22:29:39    

Nice.

Bush had Oil.  
7550 2018-12-02 22:29:38 Time for an eye mask with rose oil
7551 2018-12-02 22:29:35 As per Bob N, the two playoff series that the Oil have played in the last decade really cemented their division rivalries..
7552 2018-12-02 22:29:31 This one is always against PMB in his arguments and submission, but always clamoring for objectivity .
7553 2018-12-02 22:29:24 @dunnesstores when are you going to promote palm oil free or responsible products? #savetherainforests #PalmOil
7554 2018-12-02 22:29:21 @RunningBulls007 cannabis reduces pain, improves appetite, and aids in sleep.  Nothing new. The seniors can just use cannabis oil. 
7555 2018-12-02 22:28:44 The past few weeks have make me do lots of day trading...of course I'm still invested in few companies, but have been snaping day trades in stocks like ACB, BBD, BTE, CPG, TVE. Oil had been nailed down, thus most of the producers look good for a swing...JIMO
7556 2018-12-02 22:28:41 Oil is at extremely low levels. No idea...
7557 2018-12-02 22:28:40 Today, am trialing a new nit-busting method - on top of my normal ones - jasmine oil. I’m highly dubious, but it comes highly recommended - and so now kids’ normal school gel/hairspray hair helmets smell akin to vomit. #parenting
7558 2018-12-02 22:28:39 Batman’s suit probably smells like baby oil and stale farts.
7559 2018-12-02 22:28:34 I guess for someone who's acnegenic the thick Nivea creme would be too much but on my skin it's fine, I have combination clear skin, I really never break out but I might get just one pimple every 4 months that I put some Desert Essence tea tree oil on
7560 2018-12-02 22:28:32 Is your child texting about the keto diet?

LOL     -Leg Of Lamb 
TBH    -That Beautiful Ham
OMG   -Outstanding Meat Gravy 
LMAO  -Let’s Make Avocado Oil
DTF      -Don’t Trim Fat 
BRB     -Baked Ribs Babe

7561 2018-12-02 22:28:31 It’s so clear the corrupt US government is in the pocket of big oil, why are people like al gore not screaming this from the rooftops!
7562 2018-12-02 22:28:25 Rejig the line to bypass Quebec and you’ll be fine. Plus the federal government should ban importing oil from Saudi Arabia. Canadians should stick together and thrive as a whole nation. The West has oil-buy from us. Please and thank you!
7563 2018-12-02 22:28:22 Has the oil industry destroyed our countries future? Did you know Obama just credit for the US becoming the no.1 world's oil exporter? How does that sit with you?
7564 2018-12-02 22:28:16 .... But then we gained independence, discovered oil and  the 21st (technology) century 
7565 2018-12-02 22:28:07 After cancer diagnosis... stay positive and any amount of nonsense around tumeric, kale, cannabis oil blah blah blah
7566 2018-12-02 22:27:54 I really need more rosehip oil lip gloss. Smells so good and moisturizing
7567 2018-12-02 22:27:49 @Tesco when are you going to publish palm oil free or responsible products? #savetherainforests #PalmOil #orangu
7568 2018-12-02 22:27:47 Tom Brady is not the Bread winner in his house.  He covers their cell phone bills, oil, and uses his Insurance.  G pays the Mortgage.
7569 2018-12-02 22:27:46 What I’ve always wondered: how did terrorists know when, where, how to steel oil & find real buyers for it? That in itself could be full time jobs for a lot of people. That type of infrastructure makes me suspicious. But then I’m suspicious by nature. Always asking ‘what if.’
7570 2018-12-02 22:27:43 you do realize that is bc oil and gas is the dominant industry in texas right... so someone who donates like 50 bucks is counted for the industry.
7571 2018-12-02 22:27:37 i put eucalyptus oil in the bath/shower when i have a cold
7572 2018-12-02 22:27:31 WD40 isn't a lubricant. It's a penetrating oil.
7573 2018-12-02 22:27:29 偉い！お互い1週間頑張ってこー
7574 2018-12-02 22:27:13 見つかったら殺される系の逃げる夢を見た。逃げる夢はよくみるけど、ほんと疲れる…………( ´-ω-)おはよー

7577 2018-12-02 22:26:57 You can't provide a single instance where a sceptic (not an institution) got funding from BIG OIL.

You're pathetic.
7578 2018-12-02 22:26:55 They've made great improvements in the last decade, but have likely picked the low hanging fruit. Further improvements will be harder and smaller to achieve. Price pressures will continue to force them to improve costs, but it will for other oil sources as well.
7579 2018-12-02 22:26:52 Me la pude poner again porque me lubriqué bien el área! I know que es porque se mueve mucho pero me voy a dar el chance de poder cuidármela as it should be i guess. Gracias por lo del sea salta, agua y tea tree oil!!!
7580 2018-12-02 22:26:49 2018 has been A YEAR, so I’ve decided to celebrate Hanukkah for the rest of December instead of just eight nights. Gonna stretch that oil OUT. 

Related: my mom makes better latkes that your mom, but if you think your mom’s latkas might rival my mom’s, please invite me over.
7581 2018-12-02 22:26:37 Wanted to order for more olive oil for shiloh. I dnt even know again. its sunday. Make I dey watch God.
7582 2018-12-02 22:26:36 This is BS!! Lower oil prices is a savings for all us middle class. Oh, not CNN and the elites!! I get it now.
7583 2018-12-02 22:26:26 Snake oil Johnson, I’ve just received a new improved batch of oil. Fresh snake, low prices, trust me it will cure all your woes.
7584 2018-12-02 22:26:26 BIO OIL FOR ALL MY UGLY ASS SCARS LMAO
7585 2018-12-02 22:26:19 *pours a bottle of olive oil directly into my hot chocolate* god may not suck dick but i do
7586 2018-12-02 22:26:17 Brownies are healthy. They have Vegetable oil. vegetable. End of story.
7587 2018-12-02 22:26:16 But, seriously...have you ever seen such a thing in a big pot at the end of a counter service setup next to the chili oil?
7588 2018-12-02 22:26:15 I see a styrofoam cup, a water bottle, which means you stay hydrated, and got MF apple juice or hair oil? I don't see no culture in these walls give us a tour.
7589 2018-12-02 22:26:09 Yeah right!If Obama was still President CNN will be bragging about how low the oil prices are because of Obama's policies,  You hypocrites.
President Donald J Trump. #MAGA
7590 2018-12-02 22:26:01 You really can't get a straight answer from The Internet (ie. Google searches) any more. I'm searching for different country's oil production for a story. Egypt's: 660K/day. Saudi: 10M/day. UAE: 2.9M/day. Venezuela: "How Venezuela Ruined its Oil Industry."
7591 2018-12-02 22:25:53 From a Parisian perspective, why exactly are they protesting? All I know is it involves an oil tax
7592 2018-12-02 22:25:41 And he calls Ryan Tannehill “a little Ryan Tannehill”
7593 2018-12-02 22:25:34 30 days of Christmas  

For all my brothers & sisters celebrating that oil tn

Day 7: Eight crazy nights
7594 2018-12-02 22:25:22 The most I ever do to my hair is braid it & sometimes I'll put coconut oil in it. I guess we'll all just be bald together 
7595 2018-12-02 22:25:17 Did you think we all need to be very concerned about the climate and should do everything we can to help with this issue? I hope since you took $700,000 dollars from the oil industry, that you have woken up to the problems ahead of us.
You have children, don’t you. Think of them
7596 2018-12-02 22:25:10 Sunday: sewing felt ornaments for ppl I love and bought an oil diffuser 
7597 2018-12-02 22:25:04 Whew, so many plans. So much driving. I need an oil change 
7598 2018-12-02 22:24:58 I agree that we should also invest in renewable energy (which is  happening). And thanks for the articles on the environmental impacts of the oil sands. What makes climate change so hard to solve is that it's global; I'm less worried about our ability to handle local impacts.
7599 2018-12-02 22:24:58 right ok I’m keeping myself awake til midnight, downing this castor oil, chasing it with diet coke and then sleeping
7600 2018-12-02 22:24:57 But we don't rely on foreign oil.  Foreign oil relies on the US.
7601 2018-12-02 22:24:55 Hahaha Allah sarki..
7602 2018-12-02 22:24:52 I do it because I’m South African  And I do see some intraprovincial rivalry from time to time. It’s gotten a bit more serious since BC put their foot down about an oil pipeline though  
As for PG 13 - geez - they’ll have to leave out all the best stuff 
7603 2018-12-02 22:24:47 i feel like i have everything i need for the winter skincare wise which is nice... sleep masks, moisturizers day and night, sheet masks, wash-off masks, oil AND water-based cleansers... im out of dr jart cicapair serum but going back to niacinamide for daytime to replace it
7604 2018-12-02 22:24:45 Let's wait oil open
7605 2018-12-02 22:24:42 Can tell by the finning on the engine. Oil cooled greatness
7606 2018-12-02 22:24:36 In a similitude the true translation is a car cannot operate [without] gasoline [or] engine oil! A person who does not desire something, does not take the action to complete what he does not desire!!
7607 2018-12-02 22:24:27 Putin & Crown Prince MBS have agreed to cut oil production. I really wish all Americans would agree to try to cut personal use of fossil fuels by 15% for a year, more if you can. Combine trips, share, conserve to send a FU message to Trump's thug friends. #FREEDOM #Independence
7608 2018-12-02 22:24:27 XLK trade at 16 pe that really cheap market basically price earnings contraction for the next two year and it will not happen and market start to realizing that pricing mistake.
Low oil price, low inflation and low interest rate will keep this cycle alive for the next 3 years
7609 2018-12-02 22:24:24 Preferably with oil
7610 2018-12-02 22:24:14 やっとるん？サポーターなりたいんやけど！
7611 2018-12-02 22:24:10 土曜はちょっと凹んでたけど昨日復活したっ！
7612 2018-12-02 22:24:04 There was no funding for sceptics.

After the 100s of millions you lot got - I'd have thought you would have got your BIG OIL chums to pay one sceptic so you could falsely claim we got BIG OIL money.
LOL
7613 2018-12-02 22:23:53 家賃下がるんじゃ無いですかね。スルガ減免組が強気に家賃を下げてこられるのと、生産緑地指定解除でアパートがまだまだ建ちそうな予感。
7614 2018-12-02 22:23:36 Government policies are not the oil sands biggest problem. World supply, prices and the oil sands' relatively expensive extraction costs are. Fracking means we're never going to get back to $100 oil and the new equilibrium price range will be the biggest long term problem.
7615 2018-12-02 22:23:26 wow sana oil singkit
7616 2018-12-02 22:23:17 Where is @its_hammadrabiu ,its bn a while , hope you're good.
7617 2018-12-02 22:23:12 Remembering the American and European Left constantly accused him of  PERSONALLY seeking to profit in the oil business. (Blood for Oil) ( and C. Sagan predicts “nuclear winter” from oil fires)
7618 2018-12-02 22:23:07 Potato peel is a great topping on mashed potato...
Put the peelings in a tray in the oven with oil/seasoning, cook until crisp and use to top cheese & potato pie or cottage pie etc. 
Great texture and keeps the peeling goodness in your food!
7619 2018-12-02 22:23:05 Lavender & Eucalyptus! Both are very calming & relaxing. Peppermint for nausea. & Tea Tree Oil for blemishes.
7620 2018-12-02 22:22:58 The Iranians and most middle eastern oil barring countries need oil at 70.00 a barrel or higher to keep their economies afloat. Cheap oil makes the dollar stronger and war more of a possibility.
7621 2018-12-02 22:22:45 The winter drilling season operates off of budgets in part determine by the Oil prices. The USA/China G20 'no deal yet' narrative could see further decline in Oil prices in Brent/WTI which could slice rigs working in canada by some %. This will be known in a matter of days.
7622 2018-12-02 22:22:42 this includes normal people who work in the oil/gas industry, not necessarily BP paying him off in a nefarious way .... its texas for crying out loud
7623 2018-12-02 22:22:40 I’m sure there’s an essential oil to combat this. And I bet if you use it after refusing your influenza vaccine, it actually ENHANCES your resistance to germs. 

Or some shit like that. 
7624 2018-12-02 22:22:35 Environmentalists want oil prices as high as possible to dissuade people from buying SUVs. How are Parisians currently reacting to higher fuel prices?
7625 2018-12-02 22:22:34 Yeah people tried to tell me we invaded for the oil
7626 2018-12-02 22:22:34 Energy East would be a win. Canada would be a lot less reliant on Dictatorship oil from Countries that fund terror groups, kill journalist, rape women, starve children and kill their own people. Canadian oil fuelling Eastern Canada. A Real Win For The Country
7627 2018-12-02 22:22:31 Control food you control people same goes for control oil u control ppl. Who is the bad guy? If there is one.
7628 2018-12-02 22:22:27 This is oil spillage
7629 2018-12-02 22:22:27 No "du monde" means 14th richest economy in the world not Europe.  Don't know why anyone is laughing, have you seen the size of the Clair oil field?  Angus realises that becoming an Independent country will have challenges but I doubt he feels we couldn't stand on our own easily.
7630 2018-12-02 22:22:18 Few drops of refined oil, may be with some proteins blended could be one more option.
7631 2018-12-02 22:22:04 @colleenlouise_ please help out my friend Halsey! Share your essential oil wisdom with her
7632 2018-12-02 22:21:55 My dad has broken his leg in 3 places it's still unclear on how he did it I do know the seas have been rough for the oil rigs lately. He probably will go for surgery later on tonight. He can't fell his foot so I'm going to say they do emergency surgery. Long night ahead
7633 2018-12-02 22:21:51 おぱよーー！
7634 2018-12-02 22:21:45 Amin dear
7635 2018-12-02 22:21:34 I have peppermint oil in my scalp you CANT tell me nothing I feel like a York pattie in this bitch
7636 2018-12-02 22:21:31 It’s okay, eso pasa!!!! Eso se forma cuando se mueve mucho la pantalla, lo ideal es que no se mueva, pero septums son tricky. Cuando se te cure, no te saldrán más. A mi se me iban con una pasta de sea salt y agua bastante tibia o con tea tree oil
7637 2018-12-02 22:21:29 As a watercolorist, I’m going insane here waiting 15+ minutes for some enamel paint to dry. I don’t know how you oil painting folks in my feed do it!
7638 2018-12-02 22:21:15 Yet, they’ll have no problem in taking the oil
7639 2018-12-02 22:21:13 Oil, carbon dioxide, greenhouse effect, climate change, disaster, economic loss.
7640 2018-12-02 22:21:11 Just spilt olbas oil on my pillow. My eyes are going to stream for weeks 
7641 2018-12-02 22:21:09 I've worked on seismic crews in the oil patch, construction camps in Labrador, a mining camp in NWT, and rail gangs in the prairies. I guarantee you these are not female friendly environments.  They are borderline toxic.
7642 2018-12-02 22:21:08 1200 mg magnesium

7643 2018-12-02 22:21:06 then i'm poor 
a swerve so tubed 
i hear the oil 
i am the past cast last 
slip was my abele 
hurl whatever 
die over
7644 2018-12-02 22:21:04 Trust the oil of the future 
7645 2018-12-02 22:20:55 Long term view ::  Scabs at MI6 using media to start trouble in over the hill in  Ukraine to divert attention from local xenophobic inversion after North sea oil declines.  Iran treated as Chinese proxy for biblical showdown over ontological morality.
7646 2018-12-02 22:20:54 ..why is it that NUPENG/PENGASSAN never reduce petrol prices no matter how high/low oil prices in the international market..?..As soon as oil prices fall in the USA,UK,Angola etc..fuel pumps decrease by a percentage..why Naija???
7647 2018-12-02 22:20:49 The body shop scrub in oil is unreal 
7648 2018-12-02 22:20:47 ふわっちも元気やった？変わってない？
7649 2018-12-02 22:20:43 Interesting, all of the left hold up Norway as the country that made it's money from selling oil. Toooooo funny
7650 2018-12-02 22:20:18 At the Pentagon, Reince Preibus fails to convince President Trump that Muslims are sitting on vast reserves of oil. Scottie Nell Hughes wears a hijab.
7651 2018-12-02 22:20:14 @RickSantorum How come you blamed scientist for getting money for spurring on the climate change issue, when you received $700,000 from the oil industry, maybe to deny climate change?
7652 2018-12-02 22:20:11 You dismissively suggested that the federal government was buying votes in 1996 in the midst of a "booming" oil patch only to then pivot to "yes, these initiatives created business. Sounds like a good thing to me" as though I was actually suggesting they were bad.
7653 2018-12-02 22:20:11 Actually when compared to our neighbors to the East they faired way better than we did. Same oil price drop different impact with biggest difference being differing gov policies.
7654 2018-12-02 22:20:11 Who wants to rub me down in coconut oil when I get back ? As friends tho
7655 2018-12-02 22:19:58 Oil prices were real cheap during the Great Recession!!!!!!!  #VOTEDEMOCRAT
7656 2018-12-02 22:19:57 Watching the Lucas Oil Challenge Cup in the restaurant. The way they're getting mangled, I wonder why they even bother to put on the body shell. Why not just run chassis? LOL
7657 2018-12-02 22:19:54 When you get your oil changed, your car suddenly dies 3 times,and a week later the car has no oil. #YouHadOneJob
7658 2018-12-02 22:19:43 Shale oil is not sustainable. It’s not profitable, it requires constant investments, its wastewaters are a huge problem and the extra light it produces is a problem for refiners.
7659 2018-12-02 22:19:38 The only thing that can save the dinosaurs of the Liberal Party is if their rotting corpses become oil
7660 2018-12-02 22:19:30 Happy Hanukkah! May the oil last, and the light shine
7661 2018-12-02 22:19:26 Hi everyone....burning the midnight oil again...but loving the tunes! Nice to be along for the ride.
7662 2018-12-02 22:19:02 When your skin is producing excess oil, it’s trying to make up for a lack thereof. So adding oils and making sure my skin is always moisturized, helped my skin to stop being oily bc it’s not getting all that it needs. I use the SSS from @AYELEANDCO
7663 2018-12-02 22:19:01 進捗は完成したら消すよ
7664 2018-12-02 22:18:57 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
7665 2018-12-02 22:18:53 Back home on Friday my poor baby needs an oil change w all these miles lmfaoooo
7666 2018-12-02 22:18:50 It will, Independence and get us away from the bankrupt Union cc £6tn in debt that have squandered £4.3Tn of our oil revenue alone -fortunately I have a lot more confidence in Scots now the Unionist liars have been outed
7667 2018-12-02 22:18:50 Such a nice beautiful ass. I would waste a whole bottle of baby oil on that shit!!!
7668 2018-12-02 22:18:42 Il n'a pas son permis Il ne peut pas connaître le prix d'un litre de super ou de gaz oil 
Mais il veut emprunter des milliards d'€ Et ne pas les rembourser car la dette c'est du bidon 
7669 2018-12-02 22:18:36 よかったよおおお
7670 2018-12-02 22:18:28 I think it’d be funny if oil rig workers kissed each other real tender. Like really really tender.
7671 2018-12-02 22:18:17 Doubt it, maybe for the pseudo health nuts. Pure cbd oil with less refining will give best heath benefits. There might be a few cbd drinks like that but i bet most will be so processed it will have a diminished effect. I just put my fav cbd oil in my fav drink prob solved
7672 2018-12-02 22:18:17 Pain begins for oil shorts in 45 min! 6 long weeks of a down move comes to an end starting tonight! #OOTT
7673 2018-12-02 22:18:16 It was a k20, he hit a dip and fucked his oil pan up then blew his engine up
7674 2018-12-02 22:18:08 I got taught to change oil,carberater, transmission,drive gravel truck with a spit shift
7675 2018-12-02 22:18:06 its so weird getting my period again, my body is so confused and im a hormonal mess.  back roads, Northlane + my oil pen to find balance.
7676 2018-12-02 22:18:04 Males with beards who smell like patchouli oil 
7677 2018-12-02 22:17:54 Uh huh. Sure there’s a correlation. But let me ask, which has larger global ramifications? Desertification, agricultural practices, or big oil?  

Until we agree there, won’t we be targeting the wrong thing to tackle? I think so.
7678 2018-12-02 22:17:50 It’s pretty slow at the beginning but towards the end you get to rampage the South like Sherman did and take on Oil and Railroad oligarchs and fight creepy gangs that make the Deliverance guys look genteel. I almost feel bad this game was made using sweatshop labor
7679 2018-12-02 22:17:45 It’s almost insulting how dumb you think Oklahomans are. Gas is under $2 here. The French are rioting because the oil they receive from Saudi Arabia is more expensive due to the French President denouncing the Saudi’s murder of a Journalist.

7680 2018-12-02 22:17:44 A holiday which happily extolls the virtues of oil and its impermanence. L’chaim!
7681 2018-12-02 22:17:37 Well, I think Americans can easily get behind a holiday based on oil and fire, ya know?
7682 2018-12-02 22:17:27 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
7683 2018-12-02 22:17:26 Vacancy rates is higher in Calgary then that imo,  but oil will rebound again Alberta oil ain’t going anywhere both fig and literally. I hope govt changes coming next year fixes that issue. world laughs at Canada’s oil industry over land lock Clean and safe. $cpg Is a buy $4 
7684 2018-12-02 22:17:24 My face is such an oil machine  I took a shower 4am today and at this point I’m a fucking greaseball. I gotta go wash this shit

7692 2018-12-02 22:15:51 Yeah and like that with your cars,oil, and all your factories you will destroy the planet too, congratulation America. If prices of fuel are increasing , people will not buy fuel anymore and they will have new cars which don’t polluting so it’s not about socialism but ecology 
7693 2018-12-02 22:15:42 To the People of Alberta:
Regardless of your age, religion, class or race you are the resource owners of the oil being sold at a discount to WTI. You and you alone are bankrolling the price discount and you have a say in how your managed resource is forfeiting these billions
7694 2018-12-02 22:15:41 Most men are great as are most women - this grouping of all me in construction or oil is disgusting. Do you have a father, husband, brother or son!?!?
7695 2018-12-02 22:15:40 I am a democrat  wish Trump will invest in Russia better then Saudi Arabia, Israel it don't mean I support Trump I don't  Trump will not Invest in Anything Unless there is Oil gold . Trump did not Win the Election he Is liar  Hillary got More Votes
7696 2018-12-02 22:15:33 No heart, no brains and no oil can.....No interim wizard can fix all three this season.
Let MM ride the season and the FO put all efforts on what's important..next season...HC and the corrections needed.
7697 2018-12-02 22:15:08 I spilled my body oil then my wine. Ok
7698 2018-12-02 22:15:06 Of course it was. #RexTillerson, head of Exxon, Trump's first Secy of State, and Trump wanted the Obama sanctions lifted in order to construct an oil pipeline which would gain them and Putin untold billions.
7699 2018-12-02 22:15:03 Even stuff that might not immediately register as "junk"; just found seed oil in Campbell soups like tomato and cream of celery.
7700 2018-12-02 22:15:01 and if I really want to put mineral oil and petrolatum on my skin I can go buy some Nivea Creme in the dark Blue Glass jar from Walmart, I like both the Nivea soft creme and the thicker version of Nivea creme so I have both
7701 2018-12-02 22:14:57 Anything with Jojoba and Argan oil!
7702 2018-12-02 22:14:56 We will get over that as well.
7703 2018-12-02 22:14:52 I love the way the same companies who paid to create this green monster now find their plants are about to close because the monster they fed now denies them oil from fracking.

you reap what you sow.
7704 2018-12-02 22:14:52 GT is in the oil change bowl
7705 2018-12-02 22:14:46 Solve our contribution, error on the side of safety.
The added benefit of a lack of reliance on foreign oil will also reduce conflict, and our defence budget as a side bonus.
7706 2018-12-02 22:14:44 Sure it's a problem, but remember when they said the oil sands could never be developed at all? Technology has a way of finding a way when there's boatloads of money to be made. The tech involved in oilsands is some of the best in the biz. Why not give this a chance to devp?
7707 2018-12-02 22:14:34 I have wondered what happened to this deal. I was sure that once Rexxon came to the administration, all that oil would run free and clear.
7708 2018-12-02 22:14:25 “birth olive oil”??

7710 2018-12-02 22:14:17 The time for blaming all of our woes on low oil prices has come and gone.

7714 2018-12-02 22:14:05 I\m old enough to remember when olive oil was sold in pharmacies not supermarkets (unless it was in the medicines or bathrooms aisle) so there is a British tradition for improving skin and hair too.
7715 2018-12-02 22:14:03 Yeah... Well that's semantics. Big oil itself is GOP because of $$$. If they'd make more $$ being liberal, they'd switch in a heartbeat. As for the common person, oil is cheap. Make other options cheaper for ppl to afford. That's why wind energy is in the rise - tax breaks.
7716 2018-12-02 22:14:01 Mixed emotions, hurt; first President to send me to war. VA does not recognize common issues so many of us have who were bombed, chemical, oil fire exposure, or premature anthax shots. Not crazy; definitely ill. A Bush in office, off to war, alright.

7724 2018-12-02 22:12:39 As chairman  I write toi all 5 big oil companies - only one even replied.

It's a total lie to say there was funding for sceptics.

There was no funding for sceptics.
7725 2018-12-02 22:12:39 So who thinks the 5th fleet admiral suicide was an Iranian hit job? They want to control both oil straights, so seems like they are going to take our navy out too.
7726 2018-12-02 22:12:38 I want to meet the guy who is rich enough to pay the 98% of the scientists who disagree with the 2% being funded by big oil?
7727 2018-12-02 22:12:37 This month, yes, that is the oil sands biggest short term problem. In the medium and long term, extraction cost relative to world prices is its biggest problem.
7728 2018-12-02 22:12:35 Just getting the full story straight. 2200 years ago, Jews occupying Palestinian land, fought the Greeks who were occupying the occupied land. After the Greeks were defeated, only a small jug of oil was found to light the menorah at the temple that didn’t exist.
7729 2018-12-02 22:12:26 I have 0% oil level. Think it’s time for an oil change.
7730 2018-12-02 22:12:24  
It’s raining condescension now, isn’t it?

Ok, breaking down the contested phrase:
First line stated the inflationary effect of oil price
Second line QUESTIONS persistence of high prices
Problem: article did NOT look at price trends (broad stroke problem)
7731 2018-12-02 22:12:12 the active ingredients in the Creme De La Mer are Algae, mineral oil and petrolatum, Algae can be easily found in one of my favorite Aveda moisturizers, the Aveda Botanic Kinetics hydrating lotion original and I love the smell of the formula
7732 2018-12-02 22:12:03 Tea tree oil ! Helps with almost anything  usually I use it for cold soars though :,)
7733 2018-12-02 22:11:57 Ha! Honestly couldn’t be easier. Equal parts chickpea flour & water. Whisk in a drizzle of olive oil, salt & pepper. Leave for an hour. They also cook really well & don’t stick-taste really good. I added some thyme, can always add any flavours you like.
7734 2018-12-02 22:11:52 The Iraqis had already pulled out of Kuwait when the US invaded, and Saddam was the CIA's poster boy for years supplying them cheap oil, the prices go up and him and the Iraqi people are target number 1. Interesting coincidence that 
7735 2018-12-02 22:11:42 "Big oil" did noting to defend the moral position it once had. They allowed themselves to become totally stupid attempting to make everyone happy.
7736 2018-12-02 22:11:41 Yes, it's all our fault. The Federal government really wanted to give back the Trillions they made from oil exports over the last century but Alberta just wouldn't have it.
7737 2018-12-02 22:11:36 Oil bust! Where did #ralphklien put all those billions!!! They wanted to become independent country! Now they come begging for $$$$ WTF!! They are fckn clown out west!! Im older than you and have seen this before.

7748 2018-12-02 22:10:32 The pipelines are much safer.  Having oil tankers is ultra dangerous when running thru populated areas. AB is scaring the public with this method of transport and many Americans and Quebecers will not allow it.
7749 2018-12-02 22:10:28 C-P-C has lowered gasoline and diesel at the pump from this morning following a decline in international crude oil prices last week.
7750 2018-12-02 22:10:27 Wind mills don't create power.  Wind turbines do.  And you are right, cutting back on oil will not happen magically, it requires policy and/or rising prices or running out.

7773 2018-12-02 22:09:02 Compromises aren't easy to defend, of course. We want to both (a) reduce demand for oil, using a global carbon price, *and* (b) as long as people need oil, get the best price for Canadian exports. The WCS price is below $15/barrel right now, even without expansion.

7778 2018-12-02 22:08:50 Extracting and burning oil increases global warming, of course.  Converting away from oil and gas sooner would help slow it.  Raising gas prices will cut consumption and make alternatives more economically viable now...

I've basically implied that the global market may price (some or most of) the tar sands out of the market.  If  human rights abuses and middle east conflicts increase the cost of ME oil, then the oil sands have a better shot of being viable,

Good luck!
7787 2018-12-02 22:08:29 That’s a hard proposition given that the funding comes from cash and hawala transactions including coupon scams, goods exchange, oil pilfering, narcotics, etc. Saudis and Qataris still continue to throw money  at radicals thinking that will buy them some legitimacy with jihadis.

7795 2018-12-02 22:07:48 Yeah, OPEC is causing Canadian oil to sell at $16.
7796 2018-12-02 22:07:38 vat+duty is already about 60% of what your paying for when your buying it (and that dosent include taxes upstream on north sea oil), my recollection is that the duty does internalize the climate and road cost of private transport + extra.
7797 2018-12-02 22:07:24 What kind of oil do you use?
7798 2018-12-02 22:07:18 This is a bit inaccurate. When donating to a political candidate, you have to state what company you work for. He received donations from people who worked for oil companies. He received $0 from PAC’s.

7817 2018-12-02 22:05:24 I hate those onion paste rings. Sure theumy may be uniform, but they taste like paste inside. Awful. I prefer breading over batter because batter absorbs more oil, and they are like onion doughnuts.
7818 2018-12-02 22:05:18 1) Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page met with representatives of Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft
2)The Kremlin targeted educated youth and swing state voters during its cyber attacks in the 2016 campaign. 
3) Trump maintains ties to rich businessmen from Azerbaijan.

7820 2018-12-02 22:05:08 I have seen more honest snake oil salesmen -getting PPS to do dirty job -MPs should tell them off, push if they get too annoying and in your face - coercion, corruption? Trying to influence MP votes - honest MPs don’t take orders from May/Maybots-we voted them - they represent us
7821 2018-12-02 22:05:07 See GP re possibility of PCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome. A symptom is debilitating cramps. The way menstruation goes for each individual varies over time but there's a cause for serious pain. Wrapped hot water bottle against sorest bits + lavender oil on skin/tablets and sleep
7822 2018-12-02 22:04:58 Jeffrey St Clair:

"The Che of Texas, Beto O'Rouke, is the number two recipient of oil/gas money in the Congress...right behind Rafael Cruz"
7823 2018-12-02 22:04:56 It was Treason
Ru offered big chunk of worlds largest oil comp as outlined n Dossier 
Almost 20%—biggest merger Asia E Europe in 2016

Sanctions lifted on FSB GRU &

7827 2018-12-02 22:04:23 Europe doesn’t ignore its members unlike the U.K.

Europe hasn’t stolen trillions of pounds worth of our Oil and other revenues..
7828 2018-12-02 22:04:20 We are our own problem.. this country will never move forward. It has become a way of life for the govt & oil marketers to hike the fuel price and suffer the masses every Dec. why didn’t they take this action from Jan-Nov? @I_pissVodka @TWEETORACLE
7829 2018-12-02 22:04:11 Soon was an academic like many academics working on climate he got BIG OIL money.

But sceptics were not funded by BIG OIL. Name one sceptic organisation funded by BIG OIL?

You can't because it didn't happen.
7830 2018-12-02 22:04:07 So nobody is gonna ask why are they using baby oil??
7831 2018-12-02 22:04:04 Culling of the Oil Patch

7836 2018-12-02 22:03:33 The RSPO standard was recently revised to prohibit deforestation, clearing of peat and exploitation (NDPE). While it will be sometime before growers are certified against the new standard, growers from Palm Oil Innovation Group are already verified as delivering NDPE oil.

7840 2018-12-02 22:03:27 "unbias research" In other words research you don't like. I'm from Fort McMurray, the oil sands has been good for us but the camps have brought a slew of problems with them which is reflected in our VERY REAL reputation for drug/alcohol addiction, sex trade, sexual diseases, etc
7841 2018-12-02 22:03:22 They have 3rd party insurance policies on American ppl and our Military. They are using our Military to build an oil pipeline.  Then everytime a solider dies these ppl make money off it. International War crimes.
7842 2018-12-02 22:03:14 Lavender oils are good for relaxation. Put it on your body or in your bath tub. Peppermint for migraines and headaches, put the oil on your temples. If you’re looking for oils Doterra is a good company with oils that aren’t fake or filled with other chemicals. Check’em out! 
7843 2018-12-02 22:03:12 That's what the adoption story was all about. Russia stopped allowing Americans to adopt from Russia as a retaliation against Sanctions put on them by the US. Russia wanted Trump to lift sanctions as part of their deal for him becoming President. The rest has to do with oil.
7844 2018-12-02 22:03:02 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
7845 2018-12-02 22:02:51 Tea tree oil for skin, lemongrass for clarity, peppermint for headaches, and lavender for literally anything.
7846 2018-12-02 22:02:51 u know what I put coconut oil on my face and no one can stop me my skin is dry and my pores don’t clog bitches
7847 2018-12-02 22:02:50 Depends on your hair honestly, different oils work better for certain ppl. Coconut oil & Shea butter does wonders on my skin though

7849 2018-12-02 22:02:44 Price of fuels are exponentially proportional to crude oil price
7850 2018-12-02 22:02:44 oh look another Vow, selling more snake oil...
7851 2018-12-02 22:02:43 The first Die Hard film was actually a sequel, and no cares. Donald Trump doesn’t know the difference between climate and weather. I’m looking forward to being oil for the whatever is after us, but they should know I don’t always wipe my bum as well as one would want.
7852 2018-12-02 22:02:43 Of course BIG OIL funded their pet alarmist academics to push out their bogus "research" to get the politicians to raise the price of energy and increase their profits.

They'd be stupid not to have done so.
7853 2018-12-02 22:02:42 Cinnamon-apple oil is my favorite. it reminds me of christmas, so it makes me kinda homesick but mostly happy
7854 2018-12-02 22:02:38 Só quero ver, colocar alguma pessoa decente no Twitter, e #foracampello seu traidor e banana.
7855 2018-12-02 22:02:32 It's because of their products. Nobody has a sentimental attachment to a barrel of oil
7856 2018-12-02 22:02:11 Hahahahah. Missed WHAT? The market was up 1000, pumpkin. Its all priced in. 200-300 points on the Dow? Sure. SO WHAT? Who gives a fuck. Recession coming next year, what do you THINK the the FED saw? Their shadow? Look at Oil--it never lies. China goes right into contraction.
7857 2018-12-02 22:02:04 on Sunday don’t hmu, I have coconut oil in my hair for the entire day
7858 2018-12-02 22:02:03 You are hoping to repeat Argentina and Iceland bankruptcies in Australia aren't you?
Do you realise how much we buy from overseas to survive? Oil, cars, building materials, food etc. The Aussie dollar will plummet and we will be destroyed.

7863 2018-12-02 22:01:39 Why they cutting production. If there is a glut and future looks to get off oil price goes down. #simplestuff

7867 2018-12-02 22:01:19 Happy Hanukkah, everyone. True, I'm not Jewish, but any holiday that celebrates oil fires and fried food is one I can get behind.
7868 2018-12-02 22:01:18 Maybe they can get their oil changed while they are there.
7869 2018-12-02 22:01:09 @AlanFreestone You claim that you are being trolled. Do you mean simply people calling your predatory snake oil bullshit out as predatory snake oil bullshit?
7870 2018-12-02 22:01:02 There was no funding for sceptics. That statement remains true because as you well know soon didn't get the money because he was a sceptic. He got it because BIG OIL were dolling out money to academics to help push the global warming scam.

7872 2018-12-02 22:00:37 Considering all the money Alberta has made from oil extraction, why did it never, ever invest in a refinery? Secondary transformation would have created long-term well paying jobs for Albertans instead of Americans. Now Alberta is stuck with a dirty product very few want to buy.

7878 2018-12-02 22:00:15 shale people would be hedging lot of oil when wti oil goes up. I don't think it will be faster rebound .. May be next summer oil will rally too much. Don't think it will this month regardless of opec cuts.. crossing 55.86 going to massive hurdle.
7879 2018-12-02 22:00:13 Sending the new car to its first assessment and oil change, just because there is no oil change record, which is something fishy.

7882 2018-12-02 21:59:53 I DID read the decision, dumbass.

"the US Supreme Court ... declared the Standard Oil group to be an "unreasonable" monopoly.

7883 2018-12-02 21:59:46 @DAVID_FIRTH Hey David, quick question; do your artwork in a traditional format (E.G. paint/oil on canvas like your Locust Love piece, pencil, pen, ink on paper etc.) Or do you use a digital format? E.G. Photoshop, Sketchbook, on a tablet?
7884 2018-12-02 21:59:44 I did one session as post-axis of evil sppech Venezuela and spent the whole time trying covertly negotiating getting a nuclear weapons program started with North Korea in exchange for oil. Totally normal skills building activity.
7885 2018-12-02 21:59:44 My engine leaked all my oil (I have no money to replace it) and while trying to wipe my tears I realized my sweater SOMEHOW smells like my abusive ex. Ya girl is having a BREAKDOWN breakdown.

7889 2018-12-02 21:58:30 They claim the Mayan Empire failed due to lack of constant rainfall (climate change) which constant reliable rain built it.  But the consumption of oil had no role.

7895 2018-12-02 21:57:59 Make it simpler. You can either compare emissions at the tailpipe or include the fuel source as well. So add in electricity to refine oil into fuel etc. Please reinforce comparing like for like. Comparing EV fuel source emissions to a petrol car tail pipe emissions is wrong.
7896 2018-12-02 21:57:45 Great friend of the bin Laden family - who through connections with him were allowed fly out of America after 9/11 when their family member orchestrated an attack on the world trade towers.  Great business partners.  Why let 3,000 lives get in the way of oil business

7904 2018-12-02 21:56:45 I care because data breach hits my pocketbook, and yours. 

It's like drink driving or oil spills.

What we don't have is an effective reason for WHY CEOs & CFOs should invest in cyber when they make more money under investing.
7905 2018-12-02 21:56:43 Egoistical ass. Obama tried to restrict oil production with EPA regs on fracking. Reversed by Trump - that’s why the surge in output placing the USA as a top producer.

How does it compare to the billions that BIG oil made from pushing the wind scam?

Lets work out the fraction is & how many decimal places you need for this not to be 0

7913 2018-12-02 21:56:03 "...are technically military grade..." Has someone actually dared to burden that terrible snake oil term with an official definition of what belongs and what doesn't? I hope they included ROT-13, surely the Roman military used that at some point, too...
7914 2018-12-02 21:55:59 Oil, coal..
7915 2018-12-02 21:55:52 Should we get off the hydrocarbon train? Yes. Ultimately that would be ideal. But gas is already cleaner than coal or oil - and in the wake of Fukushima/Chernobyl there isn't really much love for nuclear power in much of Europe.
7916 2018-12-02 21:55:47 As a POC this is the most infuriating thing! Like when I tell people I’m half Jamaican they almost always say, “No you can’t be”. Like nah I’m lying to you, I’m actually 100% car! I shit motor oil and drink gas!

7919 2018-12-02 21:55:33 That photo would make a great oil painting
7920 2018-12-02 21:55:28 And we need to move oil out of our country. Every one has problems.

7931 2018-12-02 21:54:45 You make a good point.  I had forgotten this principle.  It was the classic debate in my land-use planning classes was concentration vs. dispersal in 70's.  

We as students, always concluded that it was best to concentrate human activity in cities  ie Trump Tower oil drilling.
7932 2018-12-02 21:54:34 Were all of the Bears footballs soaked in baby oil before the game?
7933 2018-12-02 21:54:32 Lavender for acne, helps dry it and it smells amazing. You can also use a carrier oil (such as coconut oil) and mix with any oil/s you want-for room spray-mix with alcohol or witch hazel in a small spray bottle or use it as a perfume in a roller bottle, mixed w/ a carrier oil.

7947 2018-12-02 21:52:45 BIG OIL don't pretend to take the moral high ground. So you can hardly blame them for doing what makes them money.

But those alarmists who took BIG OIL money and then claimed to take the moral highground were scum.
7948 2018-12-02 21:52:43 If it's that bad then plz explain why it's ok for western countries to carry on as if nothing has happened....oh yes it's the oil without which the western economies would be down the pan. The western countries are in hawk to the Saudis..period.
7949 2018-12-02 21:52:39 I did not put ranch on my pizzas but I get olive oil instead of sauce and my toppings of choice are jalapenos and pineapple
7950 2018-12-02 21:52:21 rose oil, but rose stuff only when its in masks, good for toning hydrating and redness apparently. and tea tree oil, for texture bumps on the skin like acne but i doubt ur struggling w that skskskskfnc. & coconut oil for..you know
7951 2018-12-02 21:52:17 Peppermint oil or tiger balm but you gotta let it air out a bit. I typically lay with my ute out so if can get some air. I also take more than the recommended dose of ibuprofen (3-4) if I get on top of it before I’m already in pain I can usually avoid the pain all together
7952 2018-12-02 21:52:16 Beginning today, the Miracle of the Oil will be apparent for all to see.  It cannot be denied.  Even though I’ve never met you or your brother, I hope that 4th candle indicates the strength of our cyber-friendship.  God bless!
7953 2018-12-02 21:51:59 Long oil calls and long soybeans
7954 2018-12-02 21:51:59 Ok weed oil is amaze balls.
7955 2018-12-02 21:51:57 Khashoggi was a foreign national, murdered in a foreign country. Nothing to do with US. Question which should be asked is why is the CIA undermining what the President is saying? Saudi will put oil price up if sanctions Why do CIA want petro-dollar to collapse & market chaos?
7956 2018-12-02 21:51:55 If you are a Journalist in this day and age, you are either an opinionated liar, or an outcast. It is the worst time to be in MSM. Many have been devastated by Trudeau's retarded actions re: the oil sands & pipelines. Technology is a long way away from ending our reliance on oil.
7957 2018-12-02 21:51:52 Cher @ericvidalenc (et @alaingrandjean qui RT) : ne pas vouloir résorber l'inégalité de traitement entre ménages et industriels polluants revient à tuer l'idée même de fiscalité écologique en risquant d'emporter la transition. 
L'#ETS est un fiasco qui subventionne les pollueurs
7958 2018-12-02 21:51:51 Humble yourself. Kids out here 18 years old.. work with oil. Make 100k..get off your high horse..
7959 2018-12-02 21:51:41 And in other news, UCP magic creates pipelines, $100 oil and jobs jobs jobs and with the wave of a wand, court orders just go poooof gone. 
7960 2018-12-02 21:51:30 We mustn't let the 164 million other companies globally off the hook who burn most of the oil... and the 7 billion people who pay them to burn it, including me. But the oil companies are criminal in conspiring to conceal the fact that their product could cause our extinction
7961 2018-12-02 21:51:17 Big oil doesn't think like that. They're there to make money and higher energy prices, green wash and paying off green groups all add to those profits.

Paying sceptics might have been the moral thing to do, but it didn't help their profits.

7964 2018-12-02 21:51:08 Haha. Russia is now recording greater budget surpluses than in 2008 when oil was over $100. The current account surplus reached $75.8bn in 9M18, up from $19.7bn in 9M18. The non-financial sector’s external liabilities declined $10.8bn in 3Q18 — the most since 4Q14
7965 2018-12-02 21:51:01 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.

7968 2018-12-02 21:50:26 What does that have to do with the oil sands potentially being priced out of the market. Cleaner Canadian reserves like the ones you mention may be viable cost-wise and could be extracted. That doesn't change that the massive oil sands may eventually be doomed because of costs.

7978 2018-12-02 21:49:38 Are you and this astrophysicist also climate scientists? No? Then maybe you should stop peddling piss poor theories that lack scientific fact or are biased studies paid for by various gas & oil industry trade associations

7987 2018-12-02 21:48:55 Tea tree oil... Or toothpaste (so I've heard)
7988 2018-12-02 21:48:52 Who? 

BIG OIL gave massive funding to alarmists - and if I had no moral compass I could have easily taken their bribe like so many others.

Alarmists are almost all making money from the scam whilst knowingly lying about sceptics being paid by big oil.
7989 2018-12-02 21:48:47 Guess what oil is made from..
7990 2018-12-02 21:48:43 Probably gonna catch heat for this but I hate when I get fries fresh out the oil
7991 2018-12-02 21:48:40 Bad behavior in the oil patch is prized as proof of masculinity. Substance abuse, domestic violence, and other deviant behaviors are the norm among the illiterate rig-pigs. (Yes, they liked to be called that.) Shuttering AB's oil industry will do wonders for human evolution.
7992 2018-12-02 21:48:18 WTF!!!
How could anyone with any common decency follow his order? Trump has put oil and gas companies importance over every human being, every animal, bird and fish; all our environmental health. 
Live with that, Trump base.
7993 2018-12-02 21:48:18 Virgin coconut oil, I use it for the face as a natural moisturizer...

7995 2018-12-02 21:47:57 Don't feel like cooking.  I think I'll have a slice of challah and a cup of oil.

7998 2018-12-02 21:47:41 The Venezuelan state-owned oil company is a massive generator of fiscal spending for the government. Negatively impacting its ability to function in this capacity benefits Venezuelans in what way exactly? How do you imagine the lives of pensioners will IMPROVE under sanctions?
7999 2018-12-02 21:47:31 The real shame is in the big oil co's themselves being led thru their noses by these activists. They have no sense of morality 4 what the'r doing, n attempt 2 absolve themselves by compliance with the climate religion.
8000 2018-12-02 21:47:23 Are you looking for a special gift for that ambitious woman in your life? 

How about a bottle of Bergomot (the oil of self acceptance), with your favorite personal development book, or encouraging sign? 

This makes a great gift to show your confidence in the women in your life!
8001 2018-12-02 21:47:18 Where do you get this nonsense ? urplus
Russia is now recording greater budget surpluses than in 2008 when oil was over $100
8002 2018-12-02 21:47:18 Isn’t there like a cultural significance to oil wrestling or is just an excuse to do.... THAT
8003 2018-12-02 21:47:18 Health Tips: keep your omega 3 oils(incl. fish oils)  in the freezer to keep fresh and reduce the fish oil repeating on you.
8004 2018-12-02 21:47:16 I'm mix in some sriracha, a tiny bit of sugar, then milk and scramble the eggs.
Then I fry the rice with sesame seed oil (VERY LITTLE, just enough for flavor) & sriracha.

8006 2018-12-02 21:47:09 Be fair though, if I was ‘Big Oil’ I’d want to keep funding for anti-AGW secret because if it got out, that would trash the image of the researchers and cast doubt on the work, wouldn’t it?
8007 2018-12-02 21:47:07 When the U.S. imported most of its energy needs, declining oil prices were a boon to the economy.

But as the U.S. has become the world’s biggest oil producer, a growing chunk of investment, manufacturing output and jobs is tied to oil.
8008 2018-12-02 21:47:06 Funny how good thing look after a little oil rub.


8009 2018-12-02 21:47:00 @garysnowpatrol hi I just had fresh boiled greenbeans with oil salt and fried onions on top a little bit of minced beef and spaghetti with tomato sauce for lunch which was delicious. I’m so happy and proud of you that you enjoy non alcoholic beer xxxx
8010 2018-12-02 21:46:50 Haven't decided. Probably something natural like wax or oil. Definitely not polyurethane.
8011 2018-12-02 21:46:49 Thank you! I par-boiled until the edges softened (5-8 minutes), drained, then lightly drizzled with sunflower oil and salt, then roasted at 240°C until they were gold & crispy (35-40mins)

8013 2018-12-02 21:46:42 My brother buys turkish olives, olive oil and Ayran. He thinks he’s being healthy, but his dumbass doesn’t realise it’s all imported from the German Turks.
8014 2018-12-02 21:46:37 Yea . Fly an airplane / harvest a crop / build roads and bridges / with alternative energy 
In fact you can't even build alternative energy products without oil
8015 2018-12-02 21:46:36 I’m allergic to castor oil and perfume, what is my life?
8016 2018-12-02 21:46:36 I think I use oil too but that air fryer lit tho.
8017 2018-12-02 21:46:34 Someone was clearly smoking the squirrel oil as opposed to using it properly
8018 2018-12-02 21:46:31 For real! I went to a pot cafe a few years back and they were selling some apparently rare and very potent African strain priced at $400 oz. I would never buy that shit. I did try that Moon Rock stuff, weed rolled in hash and oil. It was expensive garbage.
8019 2018-12-02 21:46:23 Así es. Las noticias hablan de "suba de impuestos", no de penalizacion del uso del gas oil. De todas maneras la penalización del uso del gas oil en París es imprescindible. Aunque debe reverse en el campo, donde por ahora no existen alternativas reales.
8020 2018-12-02 21:46:03 I'm waiting for America to adopt some of that Turkish Oil Wrestling.......
8021 2018-12-02 21:45:59 Everything u just said is an example of what your party stand for. If your party had planned well, Nigeria won't be where she's today..all the oil Money u squandered it all.. there's God oooo
8022 2018-12-02 21:45:53 Rose oil and ylang ylang are my favourites. I use lavender fro headaches and tea tree oil for acne and my hair. I also use castor oil for my eyelashes 
8023 2018-12-02 21:45:39 But how can the richest country on earth afford it? Defense contractors and oil companies need their handouts!

8027 2018-12-02 21:45:26 Paris is in ruins. Burned cars. Destroyed buildings. Graffiti on the Eiffel Tower. People arrested and streets  charred. Over oil increase and rotten economy.
8028 2018-12-02 21:45:24 using leave in as moisturizer isnt that bad. you got oil?
8029 2018-12-02 21:45:20 Just went back to my feed to find that post, & everything prior to it, has been scrubbed. Now I've only existed from some time on 11-24. 9 days. Number 9, Number 9, Number 9. Anyway...the protests ARE NOT about oil, nor are they about taxes. I'd prove it if only I could find it!
8030 2018-12-02 21:45:16 It's an opportunity for the oil and pipeline industry and what did spokespersons do? Complained that they'd been offered it. Dumb, dumb, dumb.
8031 2018-12-02 21:45:14 LRTs: I don't agree that we should ignore the oil companies, they have a product and they will try to promote demand for it, but I think to stop use of fossil fuels it is more important to stop demand for it than stop extraction of it.
8032 2018-12-02 21:45:12 It’s visually confusing- but there are oil cups- 8 of them- below what seem to be the branches.

8034 2018-12-02 21:44:48 id just like to tell everyone i was summoned upstairs by my brother to smell his chin and say if it smelled like menstral blood. turns out hes been taking fish oil and his skin now smells like fish.

8037 2018-12-02 21:44:32 Name one sceptic organisation that was funded by BIG OIL.

You can't because there was no funding for sceptics.
8038 2018-12-02 21:44:31 Every Hanukkah, the Jewish people celebrate how we made 1 night of oil last for 8 nights.
Maybe if you all stopped hating on the Jews, we could help make your gas prices 8x cheaper. 
Your loss SUCKAS. 
#HappyHanukkah
8039 2018-12-02 21:44:16 Who believes Al Gore, the "climate hypocrite" who flies a lot in a oil/gas hog private jet? Not me. Didn't he say Miami was going 2 b underwater years ago? I don't believe a thing he says.
8040 2018-12-02 21:44:08 Good luck. Watch out for vegetable oil as well. That's the real killer.
8041 2018-12-02 21:44:04 Then explain how standard oil coerced anyone. They didn't control oil. They just had the greatest market share. They didn't stop others from pursuing oil. They didn't stop others from refining oil. They didn't decide who could and couldn't compete, they didn't compel consumers.
8042 2018-12-02 21:44:02 Can we ban oil subsidies too??
8043 2018-12-02 21:43:57 Pour water in a pot (500ml)
When water boils add a pinch of salt and a little bit of oil
Let flakes to simmer
You can now serve and enjoy
8044 2018-12-02 21:43:43 Reserves in Nigeria are an indication of one thing: oil price is higher than our budget benchmark. Guy - this is not just criticism for the sake of it, we're doing too badly. We have to get better. The main driver of PMB's presidency was to fight corruption. He isn't and cannot.
8045 2018-12-02 21:43:39 Oil marketers give FG seven days to pay N800b subsidy debts
8046 2018-12-02 21:43:37 drives me insane to hear ppl bleating about “don’t change fossil fuels too fast”How many decades of warnings? How many countries who’ve already done it? How many coal/oil related deaths? How many co’s crying out for support for green energy? Abandon more fossils - like the LNP
8047 2018-12-02 21:43:35 I said BIG OIL - you claimed I was a liar for saying that.

It's now clear you know you were wrong. LOL!
8048 2018-12-02 21:43:29 This is a country that is executing white farm families including the daughters. This is no more a worthy initiative than continuing to buy Saudi oil but I agree with your point
8049 2018-12-02 21:43:26 What are good techniques for creating abstract oil paintings?
8050 2018-12-02 21:43:13 don’t we all tbh , oil pens are the best
8051 2018-12-02 21:43:11 peanut oil is pretty essential for french fries so imma go with that one
8052 2018-12-02 21:43:09 Change the oil, rotated the tires, & washed the whip...Gotta do big boy next then we set for the winter
8053 2018-12-02 21:43:03 ptdrrrr compare pas notre banc à ça 
8054 2018-12-02 21:43:02 Canada (and Alberta) lacks oil refining capacity and is dependent on others to refine it. Shipping a transformed product makes sense in 3 ways: creates value-added jobs locally, requires less pipeline/railcar/tanker capacity and is less toxic in case of spill or leak.
8055 2018-12-02 21:42:58 It this a good foundation If you have oil skin?
8056 2018-12-02 21:42:57 There’s A LOT going on with this.

Is it ME? Am I not Pervy enough?
I need to hire models to watch me change my oil into the houseplants.
THAT’ll fix it!!
8057 2018-12-02 21:42:54 He promised to reduce oil price. We really entered one chance 
8058 2018-12-02 21:42:52 He cracked his oil pan and ran outta gas and blew his motor and got caught
8059 2018-12-02 21:42:45 "the dominant position of the Standard Oil Co. in the refining industry was due to unfair practices—to abuse of the control of pipe-lines, to railroad discriminations, and to unfair methods of competition in the sale of the refined petroleum products."
8060 2018-12-02 21:42:42 Selling the oil to your own US refinery at a dramatically discounted price is the ultimate tax dodge. The Alberta royalty is paid on the low oil price and the refined gas is sold at reg mkt prices.
Why would those co's want that to change? Bad for Alberta, not them.

8063 2018-12-02 21:42:35 Ok.

 Awesome. 

I will try to spread the word. 

It will be like blood/oil on our doorposts!
8064 2018-12-02 21:42:31 Agreed. A known unknown facing the market is what US will do when sanction exemptions on Iran oil is up for renewals in a few months. in short term though all I hear is short gamma...not just in oil, now the same is said for stocks to year end. Not sure what to make of it.
8065 2018-12-02 21:42:27 No doubt he's the killer . But still have oil to shut the mouth of trump
8066 2018-12-02 21:42:27 “Because he’s a Republican” or because his record includes committing crimes as POTUS and mass murdering hundreds of thousands of Middle Easterners for oil?

Be more specific please.
8067 2018-12-02 21:42:19 Having to fill up on gas and get oil changes is seriously so inconvenient
8068 2018-12-02 21:42:04 Όντως μεγάλες οι μάχες που μαίνονται στες καμαρούες πίσω που τα φισιάδικα και μέσα στα καζίνο... Κανεί κιττσιές τζαι εν κόκκαλα!

8070 2018-12-02 21:41:57 So you're trying to tell us that the only country in Europe which can't afford to be independent is the one with Europe's largest renewable energy resource and most of the EU's oil?

How does that work?
8071 2018-12-02 21:41:57 Pa volunteer... Magaling po akong manghilot ng mga kasukasuan  matatanggal po ang stress nio n prang Pau Oil Linament  cuz walang Aww sa Pau
8072 2018-12-02 21:41:56 Money  kill progressives agenda you know - big oil,  big pharmaceutical paying of our politicians
8073 2018-12-02 21:41:41 Obama shut down oil development in Gulf and refused to go with pipeline. Obama is a bold faced liar. Can’t believe audience and media don’t call him on it. He’s a liar, a hypocrite and fool. He’s a mockery to righteous public service!
8074 2018-12-02 21:41:27 Rediculous   He had so many restrictions on the oil industry
8075 2018-12-02 21:41:11 いってきます

8078 2018-12-02 21:41:05 my roommate likes to eat Thieves essential oil for her digestive system
8079 2018-12-02 21:41:04 Yeah that too but my skin doesn't itch anymore and also after shaving I put coconut oil so that helps
8080 2018-12-02 21:41:02 As I said, everyone suddenly becomes a critic. Convenient of you to neglect where they said the reserve had increased impressively and would be a substantial buffer to the oil effect. Funny how you skipped ALL their reasons for giving a positive review.
8081 2018-12-02 21:40:50 I know because I wrote to the BIG OIL companies as the Chair of one of the few Sceptic organisations and there wasn't just no money - there was a total cold shoulder.

The same story was related by several other people. THERE WAS NO MONEY FOR SCEPTICS.
8082 2018-12-02 21:40:37 Yeah, I can imagine a thing like that would cause headaches. That makes a lot of sense and I guess it's good that you put that oil in your ear or you wouldn't even know!
8083 2018-12-02 21:40:36 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
8084 2018-12-02 21:40:35 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
8085 2018-12-02 21:40:30 $500 billion in oil deal, possibly?
8086 2018-12-02 21:40:27 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…
8087 2018-12-02 21:40:17 oil production rose under his presidency. Extremely misleading because it had nothing to do with him.
8088 2018-12-02 21:40:12 George H. W. Bush, who died on Friday, also bought into the "voodoo economics" he once decried, started a war for no particular reason, had a father who profited from doing business with the Third Reich, and was an oil industry shill for his entire life. #climatechange
8089 2018-12-02 21:40:12 Idk they're both pretty bland??? It's all olive oil and lemon! I want some FL@VoR!!

8094 2018-12-02 21:39:46 If it’s not exactly between 55 - 65f in SF then good luck. City isn’t built for cold or heat. My apartment is made of Swiss cheese and currently hugging my oil radiator - and it’s not even that cold! (was in UK and below 0 - but it was all good)
8095 2018-12-02 21:39:41 revealed: every time DonaldTrump spews nonsense, a member of congress assumes he is winning #tiredofwinning
8096 2018-12-02 21:39:38 Cutouts; the play was constraining the world to oil and selling it the arctic haul. Trump and Putin would be the richest men in the world. Zillions with a z.
8097 2018-12-02 21:39:38 exactly...the 1's the cry to shut down the pipelines are the 1's who use most of the oil based products. Uneducated and proven by the way they spew their hatred for the pipelines.

8102 2018-12-02 21:38:49 you said he was funded by BIG OIL

That means you have to provide evidence showing one of the big five oil companies directly funded him.

Go slither back under your rock.
8103 2018-12-02 21:38:38 Wow!  Brilliant!  Now let’s go kill some sea life for oil. I am ashamed of America!
8104 2018-12-02 21:38:29 Part 2 of this video he cracked his oil pan and blew his motor 
8105 2018-12-02 21:38:15 Who is $BHP

There are three $BHPs, US, UK, and AUS, they all trade in markets.
Australia ADR $BHP is a Giant Miner of Iron ore, second only to Brz $VALE with 29 mines worldwide.

AUS $BHP is the largest exporter of OIL in the world, all go to China.

$BHP mirrors Ger xetra $DAX.
8106 2018-12-02 21:38:11 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts olive oil with 1 part lime juice and 1 part miso. Add shallots and maple syrup to taste.
8107 2018-12-02 21:38:10 After your done with Red Dead, I recommend Nier Automata if you want a anime android vs robots existentialist action RPG set in the far future including a oil rig robot named Engels.
8108 2018-12-02 21:37:59 What's miracle of the 1st night of Chanukah (per rabbinic retelling)? After all, everyone knew oil would last *one* night. For me, it's the faith it takes to light one candle, even knowing it may be overpowered by darkness. But if we don't lose hope, light may grow & grow
8109 2018-12-02 21:37:43 Cannabis oil really helps big hugs love xx
8110 2018-12-02 21:37:30 I can't condemn BIG oil for doing what they are supposed to do which is to make profits for shareholders.

But I can condemn those who supposedly take the moral high ground - and then take BIG OIL money like many alarmists.
8111 2018-12-02 21:37:29 It will take energy, including oil, to make a green future reality. Pipelines are the most efficient and eco-friendly way to move it. #canpoli #oilandgas
8112 2018-12-02 21:37:28 Tea tree oil for acne, and it helps with multiple things it’s amazing!!
8113 2018-12-02 21:37:26 I got a wad of chili oil on my tongue fuck me
8114 2018-12-02 21:37:18 Jojoba and vitamin e oil that I mix together I find is the best mix for me. Apply with a nail pen a few times a day so they bend instead of breaking!
8115 2018-12-02 21:37:17 Imperial Oil Canada said Friday that they oppose involuntary production cuts but  support the rail investments because that could help to improve market access. 

Opec Cuts are decided on Dec 6 in Vienna
8116 2018-12-02 21:37:12 Considering all the money Alberta has made from oil extraction, why did it never, ever invest in a refinery? Secondary transformation would have created long-term well paying jobs for Albertans instead of Americans. Now Alberta is stuck with a dirty product very few want to buy.
8117 2018-12-02 21:36:57 You're a migrant worker who works in the oil industry recruitment but claims to be a 'class warrior' and is against big business exploiting workers - do you know how pathetic that sounds. And you didn't even vote in the ref. I suggest you sleep it off.
8118 2018-12-02 21:36:53 lol my car needs an oil change. My car needs gas so I can go to school. My car also needs an engine mount. I owe my momma money. I probably owe a few people money. aaaand my bank account is -5$  yay me
8119 2018-12-02 21:36:50 Big oil grab
8120 2018-12-02 21:36:47 What you got to look out for is Sulfates. That's what causes the majority of issues - scalp issues, oil, stripping hair of texture.
8121 2018-12-02 21:36:46 Where’s my Lantern oil?
8122 2018-12-02 21:36:40 Το θέμα δεν είναι μόνο το τσάμπα αέριο στο Λαυρεντιάδη αλλά και το τσάμπα αέριο στην Kavala Oil μέσω Λαυρεντιάδη. Έχουμε να κάνουμε με απατεωνες
8123 2018-12-02 21:36:40 Being a classically trained oil painter I love your digital paintings. They LOOK like they could be done in oils. And this one is beautiful especially because of the colors and shadows used to portray distance on Vah Medoh. Saying it doesn’t look “real” is weird to say...
8124 2018-12-02 21:36:09 My hair stays in a protective style & I don’t mess w/ it. Mainly wigs . I keep my braids underneath moisturized using a spray bottle w/ water & leave in conditioner mixed. I use castor oil mixed with a couple drops of rosemary & peppermint pure essential oils on my scalp.
8125 2018-12-02 21:36:04 Beating up oil companies is shooting the messenger.  They're only responding to demand.
8126 2018-12-02 21:35:59 Debating on using oil or the air fryer for my chicken 
8127 2018-12-02 21:35:51 I'm reading about it now. Even the Supreme Court ruling found that prices fell, costs fell, outputs expanded, product quality improved, and hundreds of firms at one time or another produced & sold refined petroleum products in competition with Standard Oil. What's the problem?
8128 2018-12-02 21:35:46 So why don't you explain to Arabella, 
Joseph and Theo that Grandpa is going to allow seismic testing that will harm marine life like whales and dolphins, and oil drilling in wildlife refuges.  Grandpa likes to kill animals because he is a greedy sociopath!
8129 2018-12-02 21:35:42 Gameart Experiment: Use oil pastels to create the art of your game!
8130 2018-12-02 21:35:41 Less money for those middle eastern countries, that don’t respect women as well, if we can get eastearn Canada using Canadian oil, instead of OPEC oil. 
8131 2018-12-02 21:35:38 As wonderful as free enterprise is, it does tend to get into trouble from which it has difficulty extricating itself on its own. So far it hasn't been able to deal with dropping oil prices. It needs a little help. I think free enterprise can handle it. It's not a fragile baby.
8132 2018-12-02 21:35:36 Wish I was smokin oil rn
8133 2018-12-02 21:35:31 #Husky Husky said Friday that they oppose involuntary production cuts but  support the rail investments because that could help to improve market  access               

Shares will plunge when cuts are implement even if Oil goes up because earnings expected will fall 10% first
8134 2018-12-02 21:35:26 Cheap Oil is no longer a huge positive for the US economy and could threaten job security if prices continue to decline
8135 2018-12-02 21:35:22 Here's an idea for your next project! Oil pastels + clocks + the future + magnified! Go!
8136 2018-12-02 21:35:00 I use a lavender/peppermint oil on my temples and wrists to help with my anxiety
8137 2018-12-02 21:35:00 Post oil mask hair deserves to be stroked tbh
8138 2018-12-02 21:34:54 God its just hit me that this has definitely been set up to give the Qatari and other Middle Eastern teams a chance at success... Legitimise that oil money.
8139 2018-12-02 21:34:44 I remember how we waited since 6pm to 10 pm waiting for his arrival at Sheikh Adam Al-illory mosque, markaz Agege 2007 that was the first time I shook hand with @MBuhari it was one of the best days of my life.
I have actively supported his movement till now.

8140 2018-12-02 21:34:44 Hair oil?
8141 2018-12-02 21:34:27 @mrkiplingcakes I am very disappointed to see that you are using palm oil in your mince pies! Unfortunately I will not be buying these anymore!
8142 2018-12-02 21:34:18 The flavors are in the oil where I add mustard seeds, cumin seeds & urad dal, ginger, green chilies, & a dash of garam masala.  Then I add the okra & sauté till crisply cooked followed by tomatoes & lemon juice.
8143 2018-12-02 21:34:16 ANALYSIS—Crisis in #Alberta #Canada originates in short to midterm profiteering by oil companies. Now industry wants a taxpayer bail out while the industry enters a long-term decline & Alberta citizens need futures with real jobs.
8144 2018-12-02 21:34:02 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
8145 2018-12-02 21:33:57 I’ve lived in this house for three years and never oiled the cabinets before today. 
First, it’s actually glowing in here and smells amazing.
Second, who tf am I? I don’t oil cabinets.
8146 2018-12-02 21:33:50 I forgot to add that this projections/forecasts/predictions is based on Fitch's assumption that OIL prices will stay at $70/B. This govt has made all kinds of Adam's excuse about low OIL prices. As of today oil prices are at $65. It is an unstable commodity somewhat. Be guided.
8147 2018-12-02 21:33:46 we are manipulated by the oil money to accept the lie: ‘ islam is the religion of peace ‘...Unless you are a jew, homosexual, or an infidel. Then you can be destroyed, thrown off tall building, lied to, taxed, stoned to death And beheaded. “religion of peace..???”  think.
8148 2018-12-02 21:33:33 He’s an oil person not a butter person, I’m shocked and disappointed by this revelation
8149 2018-12-02 21:33:29 Please, by all means, lead the way.  Tell us how you have managed to wean yourself from oil and gas and derivatives.  We need real solutions, not the same old empty platitudes.
8150 2018-12-02 21:33:27 olive oil - tastes great on lettuce
8151 2018-12-02 21:33:19 made a your choice, olive oil and lemon juice, and garlic bread sandwich
8152 2018-12-02 21:33:16 Do you use regular candles the ones that burn oil?
8153 2018-12-02 21:33:14 I’m so glad I deleted it. Biggest letdown ever. I love mike, but he’s a snake oil salesman.
8154 2018-12-02 21:32:59 yung mama ko binanggit olive oil tas naisip ko sex gagong ig kase woooh easy bitch
8155 2018-12-02 21:32:52 One thing I know for sure, is that there was no money for sceptics - and I know because I wrote as chairman of the Scottish Climate and Energy Forum to all the big five oil companies asking for a donation.Only one replied and that was a blank NO.
8156 2018-12-02 21:32:51 - is palm oil included in the ingredient? I doubt that
8157 2018-12-02 21:32:50 Not all CBD products are made the same; some products may be diluted and cut with other ingredients to lower the price. To ensure you're getting quality oil, look into the CBD concentration percentage before you buy
8158 2018-12-02 21:32:44 1| A day has passed. OK to give the full accounting of 41 now? GOOD: Much more integrity than today’s Republicans. BAD: Elitist who couldn’t see his own privilege. Politically tone deaf. Dirty involvement in Iran-Contra. Gulf War only for oil, claimed was to “liberate Kuwait.”
8159 2018-12-02 21:32:41 That olive oil stuff i put in my hair smell so damn good 
8160 2018-12-02 21:32:37 As a "big oil" staff member, I totally agree that the likes if Shell (and others) have no balls or ethic and would sell themselves to whatever is politically correct. My shame to ever be associated with  them. They used to be good oil company's.
8161 2018-12-02 21:32:15 They never seemed to be a factor before the current govt came along and made it nearly impossible to do business in alberta for oil producers. As I'm sure you recall, energy companies were doing pretty well "wasting money" on alberta tar.
8162 2018-12-02 21:32:02 やって一時間で飽きてしまった。
8163 2018-12-02 21:31:50 Gana el hartazgo de la gente, el que primero sean los de fuera, el mal funcionamiento de la justicia, los viajes en avioncito mientras nos ahogan con el gas oil......
8164 2018-12-02 21:31:28 Even the PC’s forecast a huge deficit as oil plunged. The difference between the NDP and the Conservatives is a willingness to put money into programs which help (hospitals, infrastructure) instead of claiming poverty even during financial stability and cutting those things.
8165 2018-12-02 21:31:21 Oil money is not a bad idea right now
8166 2018-12-02 21:31:14 It's so easy. Just rub Harissa paste all over the leg of lamb and place it on huge chunks of aubergine and courgette with tomatoes of the vine. Drizzle olive oil and season with sea salt and pepper then roast away. I served ours with Couscous.
8167 2018-12-02 21:31:10 The miracle of oil is part of the Hanukkah tradition.  
But the focus really should be on the temple rededication after it was attacked, and Jews choosing to continue their religious practices despite it being illegal.
8168 2018-12-02 21:31:08 You can't have doubts when you have faith it's like water and oil that shit don't mix
8169 2018-12-02 21:30:54 We sell a orange flavored product that comes in a squirt bottle. You put it under your tongue for about 30 seconds and then you can swallow. So you do ingest our oil! 
8170 2018-12-02 21:30:40 De feiten. Zetel VN Veiligheidsraad Nederland en België ( 2019) belangrijker dan uitholling democratie, autonomie en soevereiniteit? Imagoverlies bij wie? Al die landen die ook tegen zijn? Schurkenstaten en corrupte staten? Al die “correcte” landen die meewerkten aan oil for food

8175 2018-12-02 21:30:10 caddy have turbo issue on late models, probably oil related. new ex demo, starting faults (intermittent & untraceable) & turbo failure. slightly older but still new, broke down & would not restart, fault not found and no quibble refund.
8176 2018-12-02 21:30:10 There was a spike in rural crime when oil crashed b/c mostly men needing quick cash took to stealing. Is that wrong to say that? Are you offended that camp life has some bad aspects to it? Because it does. If you were from Alberta you might know that.
8177 2018-12-02 21:30:08 I’m getting my first oil change with my first adult car today and these Firestone guys are my bros. They even slid me into an earlier time spot.
8178 2018-12-02 21:30:07 Need peppermint essential oil now that it’s December
8179 2018-12-02 21:30:04 I would be tempted to say that we should double fuel prices around the world so that people would think about using electric cars ... @elonmusk The problem is that they are not accessible to everyone and the economy depends on oil 
8180 2018-12-02 21:30:00 Yo' momma's so fat, every time she walks in high heels, she strikes oil!
#YoMama #YoMamaCodes
8181 2018-12-02 21:29:58 Under international law iScot would have ownership of all oil & fish in their waters. They'd obviously have to accede access to fishing stocks when joining a union but it's up to them to decide which one. UK thought they wouldn't have to; Scots saw it coming a mile off
8182 2018-12-02 21:29:32 Fracking mania has totally disrupted the global supply/demand balance and I suspect bring the equilibrium price of oil to where the oil sands cease being net profitable.
8183 2018-12-02 21:29:29 RT @greenpeacefr: #Climate — Oil drilling, massive imports of palm oil, new motorway projects... these are not the acts of a climate champion! As #COP24 begins, @EmmanuelMacron needs to set an example and put an end to projects fueling climate crisis. #StopBlahBlah (1/2)
8184 2018-12-02 21:29:27 What does CBD oil do exactly?
8185 2018-12-02 21:29:22 Syria story by yanks brits EU is all lies. It’s a chess game regime change,  control oil fields and entry through east. Money in wars . All wars ‘ WWI WWII everywhere a war happens west give the cash then control a country in assets loanrebuild . Filthy bastards
8186 2018-12-02 21:29:20 Big Oil can be for Workers & help us not Become Refugees Running to get Free Shite off Working Class Backs! @realDonaldTrump
8187 2018-12-02 21:29:05 Tantric olive oil lasts for eight days...
8188 2018-12-02 21:29:04 — combo skin

- wash face with cleansing gel 2 times a day
- use the rose water toner
- apply zinc oxide sunscreen if going outside
- use AHA/BHA serum at night
- apply a light weight moisturizer and eye creme 
- use clay masks and face oil weekly
8189 2018-12-02 21:29:02 Also slave labour to supply the west with fruits, avocado, whatever else is trendy, almond plantations taking all the California water and Palm oil is in vegan junk foods.... Pesticides etc...
8190 2018-12-02 21:28:37 I do have lung probs from working in a dusty sawmill for 30 years, but it does not bother my lungs in an allergic way.  It makes me puke and break out in a rash.  It is legal to buy here in Wa State. CBD, pure oil, edibles, etc.  Similar results. Pisses me off!!!
8191 2018-12-02 21:28:37 Fuel prices in UK are too high compare to current oil prices. UK fuel companies making unjustified profit from UK consumers. @BP_plc @Shell @BBCNews @SkyNews @guardian @GOVUK @FT @10DowningStreet @jeremycorbyn
8192 2018-12-02 21:28:32 Hundreds of millions of pounds to alarmist academics and all you deceitful alarmists can find is one single sceptics who I know doesn't warrant me even looking at it because it won't be anything.

Go slither back under your BIG OIL funded stone
8193 2018-12-02 21:28:32 They are back at it guys! They know Dcotland is on its way out and they will do anything to loose the oil, water, whisky, fish to name a few! However if you think they give a dam about you? Forget it! #indyred2 They can keep the £ it’s not worth much these days

8196 2018-12-02 21:28:22 "Respect" and Trump mix like #oil and #water
8197 2018-12-02 21:28:14 Look at all those wasted trees. Not to mention the pollution of the trucks to carry the ads. And the pollution of the refinery to make fuel and oil for said trucks. Unbelievable waste
8198 2018-12-02 21:28:10 Non è strano.Oltre a un servilismo PRO-USA ormai strutturale,il #Kuwait celebra #Bush padre, che intervenne a difesa dell'emirato (e del suo petrolio)contro #Saddam #Hussein (e per prendersi pure il suo,dell'#Iraq,petrolio).#Oil and fake intervention in defense of peace & justice
8199 2018-12-02 21:27:58 Par boil them for 5 mins. Blanch them in an ice water bath. Drain. Sautéed w extra virgins olive oil and a shit ton of diced garlic. Finish with lemon juice and zest.
8200 2018-12-02 21:27:58 Dove into ice cold Arctic Ocean, ok, climbed an oil drill tower on Shell Oil tanker, well u did get arrested, climbed into Arctic Sunrise crows nest -ok. But on the ground and Yoga
8201 2018-12-02 21:27:45 Why ignore the 3rd largest reserve? Because if the world can get enough oil to satisfy demand that is cheaper (and cleaner) to extract and refine, why would you waste the money on the Alberta tar.
8202 2018-12-02 21:27:44 Considering all the money Alberta has made from oil extraction, why did it never, ever invest in a refinery?

8203 2018-12-02 21:27:39 Finally getting this Alignment and Oil change
8204 2018-12-02 21:27:26 Absolutely @KEWtraining if Quorn can use sustainable palm oil which lets face it, the main competitor of @LindaFoods why can’t they!!
8205 2018-12-02 21:27:17 I use water based lube, or baby oil
8206 2018-12-02 21:27:14 The only thing I see wrong with this, is no silicone. Silicone is a great agent for washing hair thoroughly and shouldn't cause any oil issues. If you wash your hair every day, you'll start to notice a film on your hair.
8207 2018-12-02 21:27:13 if y'all wanna make this recipe it is very simple really, all you need is

1 flavored yoghurt (lemon preferred)
> empty it into a jar and use the yoghurt as a measuring unit from now on
3 units of flour
2 units of sugar
1 unit of olive oil (or sunflower oil)

8211 2018-12-02 21:26:52 1) MOST of the time that eminent domain is used to take land, it is for a business to get what they want. DAPL and Keystone pipelines were not government projects to benefit the people; they were for fossil fuel companies to transport and export oil. The people don’t get anything

Sceptics are not funded by big oil. Gleich proved that, the fact Shell and BP funded alarmists prove it.

A single case which no doubt isn't what you say it is, doesn't disprove the fact BIG OIL funded you lot and not sceptics.

8223 2018-12-02 21:25:32 Some extras :Cut top &bottom off so can sit flat. Slice skin off so smooth edges.Cut in to wedges. Generous dose of olive oil, salt&pepper. Roast at 180c for 30 mins, shake, add a little more olive oil, roast for another 20 ish mins @ 190/200c until golden. Utterly divine!

8236 2018-12-02 21:23:56 #Hanukkah is attained by the victory of the light of bestowal, Bina, over darkness, reception, Malchut. The desire to be like the Creator, to attain unity, against one's ego.

Stop confusing extraction licences and HMG tax revenues. Even Norway’s state own O&G Co can’t do it all.
8239 2018-12-02 21:23:36 Just went to an essential oil party the other night and learned a few things. Apparently Copabia opens your receptors so it’s suggested to put that on first before using another oil. Frankincense is good for almost everything.

8241 2018-12-02 21:23:18 i’ve had the worst dry eyes this year! my solution was any kind of moisturizing oil (rosehip or squalane was my go-to) and then vaseline on top to trap the oil in my skin. i hope you are free from this hell soon

8250 2018-12-02 21:22:30 It was a classical Adam Smith MONOPOLY.

For a while.

But the Standard Oil monopoly was UNUSUAL, in that it had no way to bar others from entering the market to compete.

Monopolies usually do. But, to be fair, that's also often where governments come in.
8251 2018-12-02 21:22:26 Where have you been for the last half-century or so, Trevor, besides probably waiting to be born? There's been government intervention in the oil industry since there was an oil industry. Whatever affect it has, has already taken place.

8258 2018-12-02 21:21:55 You surprise me Marilyn, I was not aware they had oil but that their trade was opium and still is.  It was initially the Russians that invaded Afghanistan but gave up and then USA to chase Ben Laden who made his home there and then we got involved because of NATO .-
8259 2018-12-02 21:21:43 No, becoming a fighter pilot showed his moral courage & abjuring Wall Street to start an independent oil company in west Texas showed his independence.

8271 2018-12-02 21:20:38 It was only later, when other companies started drilling for their own oil, that any competition came around.

Standard controlled the RESOURCES.

Which is typical for a monopoly.

But with oil, that could never last.

Repeat: not all products or resources are like that.
8272 2018-12-02 21:20:32 @jiffylube is there a way that people can schedule a time to get their oil changed or work we are looking to get done?

Look, read up on it. Standard Oil had effectively bought up 90% of the oil supply and controlled about the same amount of refining capacity.

People weren't "choosing" to not compete. They didn't have the resources to compete.

8316 2018-12-02 21:16:17 In the late 1800's, scientists were pointing out that pumping fossil carbon into the atmosphere could be expected to make the world warmer.
By the late 1970's, the oil industry's own scientists were saying that this was in fact happening, happening fast, and was a real problem.

8329 2018-12-02 21:14:49 Correction: That's because it was a market ripe for competition.

"Later"... Implying other people's choice not to compete is somehow coercive against consumers on the part of standard oil until the other people started competing? Not how that works.

Slither back under your stone.
8334 2018-12-02 21:14:23 If you take a tablespoon of flaxseed oil everyday that works! Good for your skin too 
8335 2018-12-02 21:14:23 I bet the oil would be sloppy like Man Utd defense
8336 2018-12-02 21:14:19 We pay $3.23 or more and the oil gets refined right here!
8337 2018-12-02 21:14:16 Yeah and oil is down more than 30% since early October peak. Gar-bage!
8338 2018-12-02 21:14:15 @Ginfoundry #ginvent @DrinksByTheDram @MCR_Gin 
Behind door number 2 Manchester Gin - Wild Spirits Gin
Super fresh top notes on the nose.Palate soft smooth with full bodied mouth feel, a high oil content 
 no rough edges.A well made spirit.
8339 2018-12-02 21:14:13 Ja genau. I love that combination  Einfach mit ein bißchen olive oil im Backofen gemacht 
8340 2018-12-02 21:14:09 Keep voting for that punk Trudeau. Be ready to pay debt off. He is an idiot and not qualified to carry an oil workers boots! Back to your cave!
8341 2018-12-02 21:14:06 U.S. federal judge also blocked a permit for construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada and ordered officials to conduct a new environmental review due to a brown footed ferret who filed a complaint apparently in both latin legalese then in english.
8342 2018-12-02 21:13:55 You can tell how gay a neighborhood is based on the number of empty Gun Oil bottles in the dumpsters.
8343 2018-12-02 21:13:43 Baloney!! He did everything in his power to stop oil production. Sally Jewell and Obama were actively trying to halt it.
8344 2018-12-02 21:13:38 On ne s’est pas compris.Telle qu’elle est (partiellement) appliquée, on sait qu’elle est inadaptée ou, si vous préférez, injuste.D’où mon insistance à écrire « généralisée » ie fonction directe du bilan carbone du produit ou carburant..Ok pour mesures autres proposées face texte.
8345 2018-12-02 21:13:34 need a coconut oil massage and my hair played with :(
8346 2018-12-02 21:13:25 Kerosene is N300 per litre in a society like Nigeria which is an oil producing country... God help the poor
8347 2018-12-02 21:13:10 The packaging says super descriptive stuff like “fish and chili oil flavored ramen.”
8348 2018-12-02 21:13:03 Deep State Presidential Candidate Job Posting:

Must be pro:
Israel/Saudi
Wall Street
Military Industrial Complex/War
Big Pharma/Private Health Ins
Big Oil

I wonder why the Deep State-controlled MSM isn’t promoting  Bernie, the progressive people’s politician.
8349 2018-12-02 21:13:02 It's that old spice beard oil... makes them hands slick.
8350 2018-12-02 21:13:01 Considering all the money Alberta has made from oil extraction, why did it never, ever invest in a refinery? Secondary transformation would have created long-term well paying jobs for Albertans instead of Americans. Now Alberta is stuck with a dirty product very few want to buy.
8351 2018-12-02 21:12:56 I think it is the right decision to cut production of oil sands up to 30% so that those Americans can not steal our oil under our nose. We have to pay all those who lose their jobs because of production cuts in full.
8352 2018-12-02 21:12:53 Bir elinde tuttugu canabis yani cetene yapragi ve kolundada DNA var suanda cannabis oil cok meshur oldu CBD belkide hastaliklara ilac olarak olabilir
8353 2018-12-02 21:12:51 He ought to tax the super rich and their foundations, which are a joke. But the tax system here could use many changes, though the oil taxes are fine.
8354 2018-12-02 21:12:45 That glow from coconut oil , arcade games , an edible and love 
8355 2018-12-02 21:12:44 Rick Simpson Oil, considered by many to be the creme de la creme of cannabis products for treating disease and illness. You follow a very precise method developed by Mr. Simpson to create the oil.
8356 2018-12-02 21:12:31 Peppermint oil for nausea!
8357 2018-12-02 21:12:06 In other words, if the gov wasn't coercing the market in their favor, standard oil was only an "efficiency monopoly", to use the economic term. In its prime, its size of market share came through efficiency in delivery of its good/service and consistently pleasing the consumer.
8358 2018-12-02 21:11:48 Weird. And here I thought God deserves the credit for its creation (like the massive find in TX), and Trump for his willingness to get off of ME oil.
8359 2018-12-02 21:11:37 I just wanna work on cars and smoke so if anybody wants to start paying me to fix their cars even like simple oil changes and brake pads
8360 2018-12-02 21:11:30 What is your favorite color or oil to put on your nails? My go-to would be the Dior Nail Glow that I absolutely love. It last me such a long time.
8361 2018-12-02 21:11:29 yeah, i understand what you mean. you’ll like Lucas Oil
8362 2018-12-02 21:11:25 That man needs less oil (especially with all those flames around) and more clothes #TheLostBoys
8363 2018-12-02 21:11:23 Neutrogena also has an oil free moisturiser with sunscreen that's less monies.
8364 2018-12-02 21:11:20 Now they can ask the deeper questions that need to be addressed. No public pleas for sympathy We want the truth. Comey will still have himself slathered in oil to slip into the cracks. He is a professional liar.
8365 2018-12-02 21:10:55 
8366 2018-12-02 21:10:51 Also went to see my buddy take delivery of his Ford GT 1 of 20 Heritage with the Gulf Oil livery! Super awesome car, 3.5L 6-cylinder twin-turbo by the way.
8367 2018-12-02 21:10:50 Peppermint - Headaches & Migraines 
Lavender - Anxiety & Sleep
Balance (DoTerra brand) - Stress & Anxiety
Those are my top 3. I get k i l l e r migraines and peppermint oil saves the day every time. 
8368 2018-12-02 21:10:46 Coconut oil is really God sent.
8369 2018-12-02 21:10:46 Wow. It's fine still, I'll find a wife to have baths with and rub down with Jasmine Oil after we meditate together. Then oil her guts with Lauryn Hill in the background.
8370 2018-12-02 21:10:28 "Countries with highly-skilled and educated workforces will possess the same comparative strategic advantages this century as those with highly-developed infrastructure, oil reserves and mineral deposits did in the past."
8371 2018-12-02 21:10:22 “He leaked oil on the track from start to finish”
8372 2018-12-02 21:10:19 おにーさんにまかせとけー！
8373 2018-12-02 21:10:18 Cocaine and Crude Oil. @VICE The documentary I needed to see today 
8374 2018-12-02 21:10:18 thats why PSX is important , investment culture is important .  inflation for a country with most local produce can be somewhat curtained , only thing is the oil and good knews trump has brought oil down :p
8375 2018-12-02 21:10:17 Is there any other aspect of the oil and gas sector left for Trudeau to demonize?
8376 2018-12-02 21:10:15 My hair smells very Xmas-like/minty right now, because I'm using an elixir (olive oil, peppermint oil, grape seed oil) as suggested by my loc stylist to help with my dry scalp. My #locs & scalp are happy right now  #naturalhair #blackhair
8377 2018-12-02 21:10:09 I use the Garnier fructis whole blends and they work really great. They come in several different scents/ingredients for different types of hair. I personally use the coconut oil/cocoa butter one for frizzy hair but they have several for dry and/or damaged hair.
8378 2018-12-02 21:10:03 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
8379 2018-12-02 21:09:51 Coconut oil and Argan oil
8380 2018-12-02 21:09:49 Data is the new oil
8381 2018-12-02 21:09:48 Oh I love this. My initial motivation was “what new stickers and slides can we make so people stop talking about oil and trolleys” because both are driving me mad, and this perhaps does just that.
8382 2018-12-02 21:09:46 Before you go to sleep after ...ahem ... imbibing, rub Grapefruit Essential Oil on the soles of your feet and drink a tall glass of water. Works for me every time ...
8383 2018-12-02 21:09:45 BIG oil gave millions to fund alarmists. I know as I was part of the wind industry which had an army of OIL funded lobbyists to push it,

Likewise, many universities get funding from BIG OIL to the tune of millions.

Don't try to play this game - alarmists are BIG OIL funded
8384 2018-12-02 21:09:44 おはー(ρ_-)ZZzz....
8385 2018-12-02 21:09:35 Instead of importing, ALMO already pissing the capitalists by announcing increase of oil production for Mexican consumption.
8386 2018-12-02 21:09:35 HIS DAD

ALSO THERE'S SO MANY KINDS OF MOTOR OIL? SO MANY MORE THAN 4.
8387 2018-12-02 21:09:34 @cruise_peter if Notley cuts oil production by 10% we’ll be paying 15-20% or more for oil products within a week or so.  Always we end up holding the bag for $B profit corporations. 
8388 2018-12-02 21:09:33 Jojoba oil
best oil for anything
it is the closest to the oils that our body naturally produces
Plus jojoba a cool ass word
It's an all around yes
8389 2018-12-02 21:09:20 Construction is a part of any industry... it's had a massive part in oil and gas
8390 2018-12-02 21:09:16 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
8391 2018-12-02 21:09:10 Panaway oil for muscle aches and period cramps
8392 2018-12-02 21:09:00 LMAOOOOOOO boy gone washing oil off the penguins 
8393 2018-12-02 21:08:59 Look at Trump’s Line Up...
Sec of State Rex Tillerson former Exxon CEO with a 500 Million deal with Putin’s Rosneft Oil waiting for sanctions to be lifted
8394 2018-12-02 21:08:49 I got an oil change today and no one even had to tell me to and if that isn’t adulting then idk what is
8395 2018-12-02 21:08:48 Vinegar AND olive oil*
8396 2018-12-02 21:08:39 Due to copper exposure from water, dry wether, after washing usage of any type of products at wet hair even mustard oil can change hair colour, tension, direct sun exposure, eating of leafy vegetables in excess...
8397 2018-12-02 21:08:16 It also helped AIG to avoid paying disability payment to workers in the oil business (by setting up a paper company in Panama) for the oil company's based in Houston, TX (like Weatherford) which put workers world-wide into poverty when highly damaged.  How do I know? Been there.
8398 2018-12-02 21:08:12 The oil and gas pipeline wars have a NEW FRONT.
8399 2018-12-02 21:08:12 Where did the Jews get the oil?  I bet you could have made a call to your Saudi buddy to get the price down.
8400 2018-12-02 21:07:59 #TakeYourSeat STOP investing in coal and oil! invest in new technology wich is already available!
8401 2018-12-02 21:07:55 I'm sure he gonna drop January oil taxes. Question is what public services gonna have less money. My guess is all social benefits for well-off.
8402 2018-12-02 21:07:52 Yep- I believe his former employee Lucy Brown when she says it’s simply a get-rich-quick scheme for Robinson: ‘monetising people’s outrage’. A snake oil salesman with rich puppet masters.
Trouble is, as obvs as this all is to you & me- people do listen to him.
8403 2018-12-02 21:07:52 Anyone else’s mom say ool istead of oil? 
8404 2018-12-02 21:07:50 Forgive my ignorance @JustinTrudeau , but how does shutting down a huge industry (oil) and bringing in millions of people create a good economy?
8405 2018-12-02 21:07:48 I just wanna get my new exhaust put on and my oil changed but I have one more hour to gooooooo
8406 2018-12-02 21:07:36 Pollution strips your hair. Deffo try caster oil, but make sure you wash it out well.
8407 2018-12-02 21:07:26 literal snake oil?
8408 2018-12-02 21:07:22 It was an accident. it was a mistake. bla, bla bla… 
8409 2018-12-02 21:07:10 Good news, you don't have to come into my mentions to defend presidents and oil tycoons. The most powerful humans who've ever lived will withstand my criticisms of them without your help.
8410 2018-12-02 21:07:08 Your oil nah 50ltrs
8411 2018-12-02 21:06:57 I’ve gotten three cold sores in the last two weeks due to stress and I’ve finally found something that combats the sore and I’m so happy. Tea tree oil is awesome, y’all!
8412 2018-12-02 21:06:49 Plus ignoring climate change means northern shipping routes, new oil drilling, bigger rosneft profits
8413 2018-12-02 21:06:41 And wait till Mueller adds the need to lift the sanctions to get at that oil! Rex Tillerson brokered a deal for Mobile to get the Russian oil, but it was under sanctions. Who did Trump hire? Rex!!! Recall the chummy dinner Rex had with Putin!
8414 2018-12-02 21:06:36 Indeed, the only thing Gleich managed to prove when he illegally obtained information from the Heartland Institute - was that they weren't funded by BIG OIL
(but the moron still published the details).
8415 2018-12-02 21:06:23 みんなに声つけて！ハリーハリーハリー！！！
8416 2018-12-02 21:06:08 HAPPY HANUKKAH HOES  get ready for 8 nights of sucking DICK!  The Jews escaped the desert on 8 nights of oil  , but you'll do it on 8 nights of CUM ! Shove a DREIDEL up your butt &amp; GOBBLE UP a LATKE dick! Send this to 8 of your Hanukk

8418 2018-12-02 21:06:02 It's admittedly a lot easier to fund universal healthcare when you're sitting on an ocean of oil like Kuwait is
8419 2018-12-02 21:05:46 Only reason I want a girl is so she can do my oil changes... would save so much money
8420 2018-12-02 21:05:44 If ur ever stuffed up just boil some water w eucalyptus oil in it 
8421 2018-12-02 21:05:42 Happy #Hanukkah May your oil never run out and your flame never be quenched. #Chanukah #HappyHanukkah #Hanukkah2018

JAJAJAJAJAJJAJA
8423 2018-12-02 21:05:36 We're going nowhere. This is exhausting. They're protesting the fuel oil taxes AND their right to be racist. You wouldn't believe the excuses I hear. "They're representative of France so ofc there are racists among them. A few bad apples don't invalidate the movement" Excuse you?
8424 2018-12-02 21:05:27 I drove to six shows in six states & wondered how many miles I traveled for Taylor...

Soldier Field: 379 miles
Papa John's Stadium: 283 miles
FirstEnergy Stadium: 622 miles
Nissan Stadium: 610 miles
Lucas Oil Stadium: 50 miles
AT&T Stadium: 1,881 miles

Total: 3,825 miles 
8425 2018-12-02 21:05:27 eucalyptus in the shower for purification and sinus relief, rose and lavender in the bath for calming and beauty, cinnamon as perfume and under the bed to keep things spicy in your love life, rosemary on doorsteps for protection & cleansing, and diluted tea tree oil on zits.
8426 2018-12-02 21:05:11 I have oil with my bread...
8427 2018-12-02 21:05:06 My friend moving in a new house she asked her mom to bless her house and make sure she bring some baby oil.  Her mom like you mean anointed oil. 
8428 2018-12-02 21:05:05 Nothing threatens the "Green Energy" people more than low gasoline prices.

They HATE it when the cost of oil drops.
8429 2018-12-02 21:05:01 1/Control being the operative word. Standard oil had overwhelming market share. There's a difference. Even Adam Smith said that a coercive monopoly results from a government grant of exclusive privilege. If you'd prefer to define monopoly as having majority market share, I can
8430 2018-12-02 21:05:01 I was in the wind industry where alarmists were being funded by BIG OIL. I know academics get massive grants from BIG OIL.

I know sceptics don't.
8431 2018-12-02 21:04:55 Use any shape pasta, a can of diced tomatoes, a can of shredded chicken, some olive oil, & seasonings--good warm or cold. I like to use Tastefully Simple's Tomato, Garlic, Pesto Mix because it is easy, but you could use basil, garlic, etc. Maybe throw in some chopped spinach.
8432 2018-12-02 21:04:54 Yes, and cleanup of oil spills, toxic waste, soil and water pollution,  etc
8433 2018-12-02 21:04:47 ほたるちゃんが喋る！動く！ヤッター！
8434 2018-12-02 21:04:44 @caliscc just had someone speak from @palmfree123 and they mentioned this article. Speaker said majority palm oil used for food. <5% cosmetics. She spoke to local culture and their detestment for the plantations. Very interesting.
8435 2018-12-02 21:04:30 Norway did not waste their oil revenue it went into a sovereign wealth fund which provides loans to industry for development and also fund their social care program. Thatcher gave it to her mates.
8436 2018-12-02 21:04:28 Its the only essential oil
8437 2018-12-02 21:04:22 There is no depth to which Trump and minions wont stoop. Death and destruction to sea mammals all for oil that we need less of not more. How about funding more renewable energy research.
8438 2018-12-02 21:04:21 The water in that Photoshopped shot is way too placid. Even tiny waves will make short work of those low buildings and trees. Also, color is too pretty. Need to add oil and toxic waste plumes, dead animal and fish floaties, scuba scavengers with spare tanks in kayaks.
8439 2018-12-02 21:04:16 I’ve been making bread for years and as long as you put the right ingredients in it works. Accuracy with flour is not that important, don’t be persuaded to add to much oil or fat. But if there’s not enough salt it will be very bland, good teaspoon per 500g flour.
8440 2018-12-02 21:04:13 Taught me how to change a tire and change the oil in my car. 
8441 2018-12-02 21:04:12 Most soy is grown to feed factory farmed animals. Pretty sure most vegans are aware of that. Problematic vegan foods are palm oil or avocados, soy hardly.
8442 2018-12-02 21:04:08 Jorja Smith so fine i’ll coconut oil the shit out of her scalp every night before bed
8443 2018-12-02 21:04:05 i love oil pastel sm
8444 2018-12-02 21:04:02 Nigga fighting wild fires and oil spills fuck this nigga 
8445 2018-12-02 21:03:57 I put them in a pan with olive oil - without peeling them , add salt, when they’re toasty -they’re ready 
8446 2018-12-02 21:03:56 An elected official cannot consider such a plan. Not in the US. Displace the oil. Subsidize the alternatives. That’s the only way.
8447 2018-12-02 21:03:54 What we need is for the men working in the oil and mining industry who are NOT assaulting women to confront and stop the men who are and for everyone to believe women and male allies who tell us this is happening.
8448 2018-12-02 21:03:53 Nicole got her fake eyelash stuck in her eye Lauren told her put baby oil in it to get it out and now she has to go to south doc hahahahaha
8449 2018-12-02 21:03:47 Try coconut oil sis. And drink more water
8450 2018-12-02 21:03:38 OIL SUBSIDY TIME BOMB. FUEL WAN SCARCE AGAIN O

8452 2018-12-02 21:03:24 If you hold her and cant catch the feeling you been chasing, you been training for, shes not for you. Thats the script. There cant be downs, dislikes and dissatisfactions in life, if you get one, its not working. Love is a machine. Oil it. -
8453 2018-12-02 21:03:24 Somehow I don't think the whole "China is now ours & Indochina is too, now give us your oil" thing is going to work out well.

On the other hand, Tojo's government left Nomura completely in the dark, so that didn't help.
8454 2018-12-02 21:03:19 No fucking zucchini or carrots. Fry in peanut oil unless you want the black smoke of burnt onions to linger for daaaays. Also sour cream + apple sauce please.
8455 2018-12-02 21:03:12 Lowest taxed part of the Uk , 40+ plus years of oil ( in one field ) worth est £585 billion , contributes over £200 billion annually to the Uk economy , = nothing to offer ? Gies piece
8456 2018-12-02 21:03:08 Vegetable oil
8457 2018-12-02 21:03:05 The greatest tragedy of the Trump era will likely be the hard turn away from green manufacturing/jobs and doubling down on fossil fuels by propping up dictators whose countries rely almost exclusively on oil and gas exports.
8458 2018-12-02 21:02:59 Dabbing away at the lil oil i have leftover from my trip 
8459 2018-12-02 21:02:59 Liberra terra meaning “freed land”, is a brand of organic products like wine, pasta, and olive oil that has been liberated from the Mafia.     #mary2 #antimafianewmedia

8461 2018-12-02 21:02:42 I am a supporter of pipelines to free land locked Alberta oil. For some reason conservatives would rather protect the legacy of Harper than admit his epic failure to build a west coast pipeline will haunt Alberta for a generation
8462 2018-12-02 21:02:37 @forestservice Donald and Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke are trying to strip existing protections for the sage-grouse, which determine the survival of an entire ecosystem of species. Don’t put Big Oil’s interests over wildlife and the environment.
8463 2018-12-02 21:02:35 Water intake is key. Oil free toners are life changing. RT @AYELEANDCO: What skincare tip was the most helpful to you? What have you changed about your routine ?
8464 2018-12-02 21:02:34 There's hope. The agricultural market operates in different situations than the urban or the oil biz. Please urban and ag, and you win elections. PC's, being totally corrupted by Big Oil, lied to everyone. Alberta needs diversity in #AbLeg and to diversify the economy ASAP.
8465 2018-12-02 21:02:13 You can't even compare the two the oil that Alberta is sharing is in such an innocuous state that that is impossible to happen!
8466 2018-12-02 21:02:09 "had the income trends held" So if oil had stayed above 98$bl.

But they didn't.

And blaming the current government for that crash that stsrted before they were elected is scraping the bottom of the barrel.

Not that we expect honesty from you anymore. Not since Kenney arrived.
8467 2018-12-02 21:02:05 @chipwilliamsjr Going to the Cowboys/Colts game in Indy in a couple of weeks. How is Lucas Oil ? Im hoping they have the roof closed. It’s supposed to be about 35 degrees
8468 2018-12-02 21:02:04 I want to learn how to do my own oil changes tired of paying people for shit.
8469 2018-12-02 21:01:58 I used sweet orange oil in my shower yesterday. It’s supposed to be calming, I mostly just like that it smells really refreshing
8470 2018-12-02 21:01:39 getting drunk and changing the oil in my car is one of my favorite things to do
8471 2018-12-02 21:01:31 The Spotify radio for @lizzo's Coconut Oil is a whole fucking mood and is giving me the energy needed for the last two weeks of the semester.
8472 2018-12-02 21:01:29 fear foods for me are anything sweet, sometimes wheat, oil, coconut milk and sugar
8473 2018-12-02 21:01:24 *"Oh? I like olive oil."
You'd be too embarrassed to give a real compliment.

*"I dunno how to cook, but I've wanted to."
8474 2018-12-02 21:01:16 Yeah, number 2 out of the top 20 politicians that receive money from the oil industry in 2018.
8475 2018-12-02 21:01:07 Busted a vitamin E capsule to rub on me and turns out it was a fish oil.
8476 2018-12-02 21:01:04 Until (or unless) every other nation has a balanced budget or the world discontinues trading oil with U.S. Dollars, our deficit will NEVER be addressed.
8477 2018-12-02 21:01:03 These people and their “climate change” garbage. It’s been doomsday since the 1970s. 

Remember “peak oil”? It’s been 40 years since that, but putting gas in a combustion engine is still cheaper than buying hay for a horse.
8478 2018-12-02 21:01:02 Abeg pass me this your oil 
8479 2018-12-02 21:00:58 Kiss of death for Leave. The original snake oil salesman against a gibbering buffoon. Boris must be persuaded against this. He would even lose to May.
8480 2018-12-02 21:00:55 Yes, let's vote for a guy that couldn't even beat a Senator that no one in Congress can stand.  That has done nothing for the State of TX. That stands by Big Oil and Big Business in general.  Pushing this is a non starter.  They are looking to lose in 2020.
8481 2018-12-02 21:00:53 Gutenberg is the new snake oil. There should be no reason why any existing WordPress theme won't work with Gutenberg.

Gutenberg compatibility should not be a selling point for a premium theme 
8482 2018-12-02 21:00:46 Stir together 4 1/2 tbsps Cantaloupe with 3 pints Cabbage. Mix in Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve with a nice chianti.
8483 2018-12-02 21:00:46 Dalton! Like oil you rise to the top!  #ProundJamaican
8484 2018-12-02 21:00:31 But the market will make that change will happen anyway. The courts. Sulphur rules. Slowing demand.

Children marching.

Oil sand have 5 years. Max.
8485 2018-12-02 21:00:30 We won't be after Brexit, those plants are productive because of TPS LEAN manufacturing which relies on JIT deliveries. If the North sea oil revenues had not been wasted industry would have been invested in

8487 2018-12-02 21:00:24 Great! Be awesome to have some awesome modern American tech drilling for our own oil. Oil is going to be drilled for and consumed. Let's have America benefit!
8488 2018-12-02 21:00:19 Booked the wrong game and it booom ....this oil too strong
8489 2018-12-02 21:00:12 That says more to how backwards Alberta was than anything else, since our right-wing politicians in BC brought I so.e of those things.  Progressive governments don't build oil pipelines.
8490 2018-12-02 21:00:08 Can y'all talk some alumni who go into climate and oil to post the difference in the numbers?
8491 2018-12-02 21:00:03 Time is a flat circle for us teams that don't have UAE or Russian Oligarch Oil money.
8492 2018-12-02 20:59:59 And for a time, Standard Oil very definitely had effective control of the petroleum industry and its products.
8493 2018-12-02 20:59:51 “Pretty okay.”

He repeats.

“Well… um. This one was made with olive oil…”
8494 2018-12-02 20:59:47 Everybody was raising their drinks, giving toasts to numerous things
"To oil!" said the french ambassador, raising his glass
8495 2018-12-02 20:59:42 @GloriaBorger Warmth between Putin and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin Salman means that Trump can be bought. Russia benefits when oil prices are very low, the actions of Saudi Arabia and Russia are forgiven. Trump is being played by sales dollars coming to America.
8496 2018-12-02 20:59:40 #France2  La taxe transition énergétique sur le gas -oil, c comme le loto du Patrimoine, l'essentiel est détourné de l'objectif. Inacceptable !
8497 2018-12-02 20:59:37 The other 4 are:
1. That there are massive feedbacks
2. That academics have any clue how to predict the climate
3. That sceptics are paid by big oil
4. That you're "scientists"
8498 2018-12-02 20:59:35 Yes the country was getting bigger and stronger and because of the oil it boomed....do you see any similarities of the trajectory of growth with North Korea's atm....mehn, its well brother. Let's face our own country, Naija go better.
8499 2018-12-02 20:59:26 And neither am I saying Dalton isn't GREAT! I just believe they are oil & water. Both deserve their own accomplishment
8500 2018-12-02 20:59:20 added to china 3 weeks ago 
re-entered Emerging mkts Friday 

be interested if given oppourtunity if you could ask guests - emerging mkt outlook 
esp in view of Powell dovish - dollar oil liquidity

be watching in Uk - until 3am UK time
8501 2018-12-02 20:59:17 Apartment towers will be built if zoning is loosened. "Displacing the oil" without changing land use patterns will leave people stranded in the exurbs and unable to drive. We need the urban density in the right places, otherwise the climate refugees will be in tent cities.
8502 2018-12-02 20:59:01 @RachelNotley Headline from Ottawa citizen: "Trudeau confronts Saudi prince" LOL 
A ban on the importation of Saudi oil and the construction of energy east , that would b a confrontation! What happened to that "social license" BS? A sadder cast in Ottawa I've never seen! Disgrace
8503 2018-12-02 20:59:00 What about filling up gas tank an oil changes. Also the vacation 
8504 2018-12-02 20:58:47 Trisha, isn't Hannuka food all involving oil because the miracle of Hanukkah is with oil? Everyone I know has potato pancakes with applesauce, sour cream, or ketchup (or plain), lots of donuts, and I think dairy food like cheesecake and cheese because a woman saved people with it
8505 2018-12-02 20:58:44 That evening all ambassadors were there, fighting for influence over oil markets
Everybody was drinking, my dad mostly enjoying the scenary
8506 2018-12-02 20:58:44 When I was little my dad would always let me "help" him with any house projects, when I got a little older we would change the oil in the cars together. I don't know if I was ever really helping, or just in the way, but he still let me be there.
8507 2018-12-02 20:58:29 Honestly, I still swear by coconut oil for make up remover but I used this as a toner tonight and it feels amaaaaazing!
8508 2018-12-02 20:58:29 Refball again, also very nice targetting by Jalen Ramsey, watch him try to purposely hurt Hilton, Inman and Rogers. Outcome is very different at Lucas Oil. 
8509 2018-12-02 20:58:16 I personally hate the smell of lavender, but you can put lavender oil on minor burns (like from touching a hot pan while cooking) and it soothes and heals it really quick!
8510 2018-12-02 20:58:06 Thieves oil with wintermint is great in my diffuser, it combats illness and smells good too
8511 2018-12-02 20:58:03 cayenne pepper oil helps with muscle pain and cramps!
8512 2018-12-02 20:58:00 Here is a starter plan:

1. Lasting caps on oil sand production.
2. Doubling  of royalties. Now.
3. Corp tax increase.
4. Immediate security on well + oil sands cleanup. If company defaults, AB takes it over and operates until enviro costs covered.
5. No pipelines.
6. Sales tax.
8513 2018-12-02 20:57:56 I had Josh Wright for 1L Contracts when he was visiting at UT. He’s an ass, but I got an A, so I’m torn.
8514 2018-12-02 20:57:50 You're not gonna find me honoring George H.W. Bush dead or alive. He was a scoundrel, a shyster on the oil fields and a suck-up to the Saudis, then the puppet-master of demented Reagan, and later the bolsterer of Shrub and Cheney. Villains all. #Bush41
8515 2018-12-02 20:57:44 PEOPLE n AMERICA I have been trying for the last 11 months to let y'all know the only jobs that is hiring in AMERICA is fastfoods, small stores, oil change businesses, department stores,gas stations and hotels, which none of them is paying a liveable wage to raise a family.
8516 2018-12-02 20:57:42 Try rubbing it gently with olive oil, then wash with warm soapy water.  :D
8517 2018-12-02 20:57:35 What do you usually use for pimples ? I use coconut oil before i sleep but do you recommend anything else ?
8518 2018-12-02 20:57:17 Of all the ridiculous claims about climate science, the most ridiculous by far is that scientists are grifters doing science for the money. The only scientists raking it in are the ones hired by oil companies, front groups & think tanks  to promote theories they know are false.
8519 2018-12-02 20:57:08 we got in our accident friday around 5pm and by like 6 or 7, @NateAdamReed said “well i guess i can cancel my appointment for an oil change” 
8520 2018-12-02 20:57:06 Lavender on my pillow for sleep. Orange on the shower base to engerguse. Lemon for when cleaning in my oil burner. And clary sage in my burner when I need a confidence boost during meditation or yoga practice. 
8521 2018-12-02 20:56:55 America kills many ancient peoples in araq and afganistan. This war for what? What America want in Afghanistan? Are they have oil ?? Qhat more? Why America peoples don't stop this war? We want peace in the world....plz stop killing.
8522 2018-12-02 20:56:48 Instead of you know, teaching us things we needed to know about how to handle scheduled meds (legal issues, prescriptions, safe storage with roommates) and the post-HS transition into self-scheduling (whether college or workplace).

Essential oil woo would have been more engaging
8523 2018-12-02 20:56:46 1st try elak yg ada mineral oil/paraffin and/or vit e/Tocopheryl Acetate. But for sure, lain org lain skin tolerance. Usually oily skin x brapa ngam dgn vit e. Yg mineral oil depends. Ada yg ok ada yg x.
8524 2018-12-02 20:56:30 This can only happen in Nigeria. Thieves are still walking in the streets even celebrating their loots!.If Oil Minister could steal such amount of money ($), How much can one fairly say of GEJ ? OBJ did his own in styles! Atiku perpetrated many fraudulent transactions etc.
8525 2018-12-02 20:56:26 I still have your coconut oil I’ve been meaning to give you for the past 2 YEARS
8526 2018-12-02 20:56:23 Obvi no one has theeee cure, BUT... my tried and true combo for reducing the length of the cold is a Neti pot, time-release vitamin C, oregano oil (it’s rough, but it’s magical) and nutrition-packed smoothies or bowls. Oh and soup/liquids

8529 2018-12-02 20:56:02 Struggled to find biscuits in @marksandspencer without Palm Oil #justsaying
8530 2018-12-02 20:55:53 Tea tree oil it has thousands of uses ♡ I put it on my piercings if they ever get irritated. And it helps me when I have a head cold. Eucalyptus, mint, and lavender are my favorite for relaxing. Just obviously be careful what you put in oil defusers around pets. 
8531 2018-12-02 20:55:44 woah... so this is the power.... of linseed oil........ sugoi..............
8532 2018-12-02 20:55:36 Whenever I hear stories about how great @GeorgeHWBush was, all I can think about is ties between the Bush family, the oil industry, the defense industry and the global arms trade via @Halliburton & @OneCarlyle and the billions in dollars in profit they made from taxpayer money.
8533 2018-12-02 20:55:36 Wait until links emerge between the gilet jaunes movement and Putin. Who suffers from higher tax on petrol & diesel? Oil producing states. Macron needs to make the case that reducing dependence on foreign oil is central to the defence of the West, environmentally & strategically
8534 2018-12-02 20:55:26 Can’t lean on shit on the rigs with out getting covered in oil base 
8535 2018-12-02 20:55:11 Ta. 
I was wrong, It probably translates to oil cup not oil head though they are homonyms (Dutch).
Peculiar name.
8536 2018-12-02 20:55:10 Lol.

We're discovering new planets daily. Same as tech. I've never seen a more futile fight for outdated and dirty technology. 

Big Oil shill.


8537 2018-12-02 20:55:08 Was it the oil drops you tried? I've only tried one bottle of it and found it to be gradual pain relief but lasted a long time. It might also depend on the brand and purity/concentration.
8538 2018-12-02 20:55:06 To Do List for This Week: 

 Apply for Healthcare

 Buy a doormat, peppermint oil, cotton balls

 Drop off scrip/pick up meds

 Wrap presents for family

 Write letter to Jay
8539 2018-12-02 20:55:03 Please let Buhari go on behalf of the country he can spend some of our oil money which he has been spending anyway
8540 2018-12-02 20:54:56 Yah Making his buddies in private oil industry rich. Imagine that! Making his 
“Cohorts” RICH, was the ONLY thing that “DO LITTLE,
ALL MOUTH” wanna b Prez
EVER did!
8541 2018-12-02 20:54:34 Oil marketers have started making threats! Very soon fuel scarcity will start!
8542 2018-12-02 20:53:54 Ppines' San Miguel eyes Malaysia's state assets sale.The refusal to buy FFB in Sabah whether that is a move to squeeze TH who owns huge acerage of palm oil plantations to submission of fire sale of its asset land,note the diversion TH under probe for 22million misconduct aihhh
8543 2018-12-02 20:53:49 As I said earlier: I grant that LATER, others got into the industry and competed. But that's because it was oil... a commonly-found thing in the ground.

Not all products are like that.
8544 2018-12-02 20:53:48 Valero is an oil company
8545 2018-12-02 20:53:47 Boycott Saudi oil!
8546 2018-12-02 20:53:43 Have you ever seen the inserts on any drug? Even something like tea tree oil? If they haven't got indications they should. Tea tree oil can fucking kill you if you use it the wrong way...i.e. drink it. Get it in your eyes and...
8547 2018-12-02 20:53:32 Abeg smile jorh 
8548 2018-12-02 20:53:24 Where do you find cinnamon and nutmeg oil !! I neeeeeeed them!
8549 2018-12-02 20:52:59 *OMAN: THERE IS CONSENSUS FOR AN OIL PRODUCTION CUT
*OMAN OIL MINISTER: OMAN READY TO CUT OIL OUTPUT WITH OPEC
8550 2018-12-02 20:52:58 China has agreed only to increase imports of commodities it has no intention of ever developing internally: soybeans, crude oil and industrial products.
8551 2018-12-02 20:52:57 And another @baxiboilers install booked in before Christmas.
This means our gas boiler installs will beat our oil installs this year.
8552 2018-12-02 20:52:57 ^vinegar. Not olive oil. I am not a chef
8553 2018-12-02 20:52:47 Friends, I have seen some serious sorrow and difficulties for many in the last few weeks from fires. Please be careful with the candles and oil for #Hannukah. We light multiples and leave them lit etc, it is habit. Take precautions, it's not a joke.
8554 2018-12-02 20:52:47 Oil prices happened to skyrocket from 2007 to 2015 or so. Now that it's back to where it was when NDP ran the province, SP running deficits.
 
Moe has accomplished literally zero things, except adding PST to used cars and insurance premiums.
8555 2018-12-02 20:52:35 He snickered at domestic oil production while in office.
8556 2018-12-02 20:52:32 Gove certainly seems to upped his daily dose of double strength snake oil, where it is personal career advancement at any cost, even if it means destroying our freedom & democracy, so we are an EU vassal state that has no say or control on what they impose on us.
8557 2018-12-02 20:52:28 “My oil blotting sheets are my hands”
8558 2018-12-02 20:52:20 Shopping with daughter number   2 at Chinook Centre(of course daddy is paying). She was planning to get a few gifts at Luch but I told her no because I will not buy from any company that go against Albertans & AB oil industry. #yyc #yyccc #calgary
8559 2018-12-02 20:52:16 A monopoly is an entity that has a complete or near-complete (90% is near-complete) control over a product or service.

Standard Oil was a monopoly by anyone's standards.
8560 2018-12-02 20:52:09 Or - I would venture - be welcomed in to EFTA with open arms. A near monopoly of all Western Europe oil reserves and enough fish stocks to service the entire annual EU demands? Would give EFTA some clout.
8561 2018-12-02 20:51:54 "Wait, the price of oil can go DOWN?"
 - conservatives with the memory of a goldfish
8562 2018-12-02 20:51:49 Today, two of my coworkers were sprayed with with 350° oil due to a malfunctioning fryer in our store. One question, how much was that private jet, again?
8563 2018-12-02 20:51:48 Yes, because quinoa and coconut oil have not decimated local ecosystems or destroyed forests. Every diet has its downsides and impacts on the world. 

What amazes me is people thinking their way is better or superior. 

If you believe in freedom then maybe let others be free too.
8564 2018-12-02 20:51:46 Rosehip oil for skin! I can’t live without it! I apply it everyday and it keeps my skin moisturized for a whole day, i don’t even use moisturizers anymore. Plus it works like magic for any discoloration or pigmentation, it really brightens the skin, it has great benefits!
8565 2018-12-02 20:51:34 Canada is not there yet because it has that sweet oil sands and lots of citizenships to sell to Chinese people.
8566 2018-12-02 20:51:34 Obama wants to take credit for all the oil and he shut it all down with the exception of the Bakken oil reserves which were on private property in North Dakota. Trump approved the pipeline and opened up Anwar. I have video of Obama saying these jobs aren't coming back.
8567 2018-12-02 20:51:31 A little bit more theme... They're from PowerGrid Deluxe, which I replaced  with Oil barrels :D
8568 2018-12-02 20:51:30 I'm millennials are killing he oil industry. Because a girl can dream. 
8569 2018-12-02 20:51:21 The behavior of Trump America with MBs is exactly the same way they behaved when the CIA killed progressive African leaders in order to control the African resources just like they are controlling the Saudi oil by selling them weapons that won’t add value to the pple but kill Em!
8570 2018-12-02 20:51:21 I hate the smell of lavender but it can be used for so much! I use @PlantTherapy oils the most and have used @doterra. 
My favorite blend is for seasonal illnesses of Germ Fighter, oregano, and frankincense. 15 drops each in a 10 ml roller bottle and filled with grape seed oil
8571 2018-12-02 20:51:20 I keep coconut oil in my car just in case I run out of petrol
8572 2018-12-02 20:51:17 As an atheist I don’t feel like an outsider at an annual Cathedral Carol service, my niece’s Nativity Play, the Xmas tree at Trafalgar Square, etc. It’s a cultural thing! You can’t mix oil and water! 
8573 2018-12-02 20:51:07 Some hair/skincare stuff I have to leave behind because I lost the tops or theyre not good for travel. My Dr. Jart body oil . My FORM multitask spray . My Boscia cleanser . I didnt even finish the bottles, thats the tragedy.
8574 2018-12-02 20:51:03  It'll be hot enough when the chicken sizzles in the oil. You can test beforehand by flicking some water droplets into the pan. If the water immediately evaporates, then you're good. Don't let the oil smoke though.
8575 2018-12-02 20:50:33 My nail girl Samathan just walked in the rain to buy me a Christmas gift  cuticle oil and lotion and did my fill for free. 

My hearts going to explode .
8576 2018-12-02 20:50:29 I tried coconut oil and that worked wonders too! 
8577 2018-12-02 20:50:19 I have just carried out a heat loss on a 2 bed thatch. 15.5kw required, they currently have a 46kw and burning 3000litres of oil a year
8578 2018-12-02 20:50:19 There it was more olive oil, cheese, fresh herbs and generations of cooking experience in the place of mustard.
8579 2018-12-02 20:50:15 Sir:  I am sure that you know The best sanctions would be to stop buying russian oil and gas but that is too much for you to be so strong. Everything else is just about nothing against Russia. But you should try to stop Nord stream 2 but what about Ms. Merkel? Would she allow you
8580 2018-12-02 20:50:12 Of course we are the we 
8581 2018-12-02 20:50:03 I put some rosemary eucalyptus oil and lavender oil  in my bath plus a mineral soak and wow  I’m in heaven
8582 2018-12-02 20:49:54 Today usually young protests # Basra again
Youth (civilians) attacked the West Qurna fields because of unemployment
It is noteworthy that more than 100 thousand foreign workers other than the higher certificates working in the oil fields in Basra, as stated by Asaad al-Eidani .
8583 2018-12-02 20:49:52 if i’m not reincarnated an an arab oil baron i’m gonna be pissed
8584 2018-12-02 20:49:42 The umbral and astral nodule step I can skip by turning in my Zeta weapons hahaha

I also have all the Oil, umbrite and crystal sands I need to go right to the final steps.
8585 2018-12-02 20:49:38 a lot of things can throw off the natural flora and ph balance of acidic/alkalinity.  I use epsom salts with some baking soda, instead of bubble baths.  I use coconut oil for lube. I watch out for others fingers, handwashing, nails trimmed, and fingers not roaming.  Probiotics 2
8586 2018-12-02 20:49:36 Gotta love inflation. Seeing that a bit too in consumer goods. And logistics. Trucking. Increased freight costs and other inputs, other than oil.
8587 2018-12-02 20:49:26 Last night I applied my rose & jojoba essential oil  then I put on a rose oil  sheet mask & finally I ripped a massive Grapevine dab  
To say the least I woke up feeling like a goddess 
8588 2018-12-02 20:49:04 半botです。中の人の正体は…ふふっ、
8589 2018-12-02 20:48:58 "Confronts Saudi prince" LOL You know what would really send a message though?
A complete ban on the importation of Saudi oil to eastern CANADA , construction of the energy east pipeline to bring oil from western CANADA! Righteous indignation doesn't cut it, ACTION does!
8590 2018-12-02 20:48:53 Ive noticed an outcry against 77 when 6 gets beat. I still think a lot of Oil fans miss a lot of what happens on the ice. A smart poke with position at the blueline to break up an entry doesnt stand out like a hit along the boards or a blocked shot.
8591 2018-12-02 20:48:45 If there is a muscular aspect to it castor oil is amazing. No don’t drink it. A gentle massage with the oil as hot as comfortable then whack it on a pad (folded up cloth) and put it around the area. It permeates the skin and helps healing. My dad was trod on by a horse, couldn’t
8592 2018-12-02 20:48:34 POLAND AND REST OF THE WORLD SHOULD STOP BURNING COAL.
I CAN DEVELOP ELECTRICITY FROM AND OR USING STILL AIR THAT WILL BE100%POLLUTION FREE.
IT WOULD SCRAP THE NUCLEAR, COAL, OIL, GAS GENERATION SYSTEMS.
I CAN DEVELOP IT IN 4/5YEARS OR EARLIER TO FREE THE WORLD FROM POLLUTION.

8594 2018-12-02 20:48:19 #RT @RealTimeWWII: "I ended up in a lifeboat, dripping with oil." Kerr is 1 of just 21 survivors; 176 dead. Kretschmer, known as "Silent Otto" for his crew's skill at evading detection, moves up German leaderboard of shipping sunk.
8595 2018-12-02 20:48:15 That's a good idea! Duck, eggs, anal plugs, oil, lubricant, Hitachi and... Tentacle? Dragon? Classic BBC?
8596 2018-12-02 20:48:01 you are wrong for starters. they overlooked everything any Oil rich country did. Obama bombed more countries then Bush, and Hillary's charity effectively died when she lost the bid for presidency....do the math. if you can
8597 2018-12-02 20:47:39 Mine never taste as good as my mum’s or any of the Mauritius-made ones.

Sizzle diced onion, garlic & crushed ginger in oil. Add half-tsp each of Garam masala, turmeric, cumin powder & sizzle. Add dhal. Stir and let the flavours coat. Add water for broth. Ad salt at the very end.
8598 2018-12-02 20:47:37 I expect, as an ex Albertan with family in AB, the following:

1. Lasting caps on oil sand production.
2. Doubling  of royalties. Now.
3. Corp tax increase.
4. Immediate security on well + oil sands cleanup. If company defaults, AB takes it over and operates until costs covered.

8600 2018-12-02 20:47:17 Chef Louis cut up some tinsel, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some live hornets, along with gravy.
8601 2018-12-02 20:47:13 @CBCnews
Please inform CBC journalists that to reduce AB oil production is not to be anti free market.

8605 2018-12-02 20:46:46 Fun Fact: When u put ur iPhone in frying pan with hot oil dollar will come out 
8606 2018-12-02 20:46:45 How can he take credit, he didn’t want more oil production.
8607 2018-12-02 20:46:43 “Dense urbanism” What’s the legal mechanism for depriving people of their assets and jobs, and then corralling them like refugees into apartment towers that don’t exist? Vacuous, unconstitutional nonsense. Displace the oil. Not the people!!!
8608 2018-12-02 20:46:36 Ok big one is lavender oil. It’s nature’s all purpose healing stuff. It can be applied directly to unbroken skin so you can bung a load in a bath. You can also stick it on the pillow. I know with a new baby you’re probably knackered but if the pain is waking you up the oil helps
8609 2018-12-02 20:46:34 They must have found oil up there
8610 2018-12-02 20:46:28 Now just remember to watch out for floating heads, scalpers, Use phrases like 2 bucks no nuts, and always remember to oil up before you hit the gym. #Chodenation
8611 2018-12-02 20:46:18 My son has Autism. While his BEHAVIOUR improves with certain things (mostly therapies and a little patience and understanding!), his Autism is not “curable”. Go pedal you snake oil elsewhere while the rest of us focus on real world solutions!!

8619 2018-12-02 20:45:49 Everybody's bitching about cheap oil except people at the gas pump. Note to Exxon: I don't CARE if you don't have record profits.
8620 2018-12-02 20:45:46 "you can’t go from selling oil to selling wooden chopsticks overnight."

Overnight, no, but in the almost 30 years where energy has gone from a $24b industry to an $83b, they had time to start selling chopsticks, plates, and a whole bunch of other stuff.
8621 2018-12-02 20:45:45 #Storycrafter I was just a kid when I was abducted.  Oil don’t know any social rules and have no idea what has been going on in the world.  Only sniper from watching the duke that held me. I feel like I am changing my beliefs and values daily trying to assimilate.
8622 2018-12-02 20:45:43 When was the last time your precious NDP balanced the budget? 
Go look.
I know, do you?
Potash was always here.
Oil was always here. 
Ag was always here.
Yet under the NDP we remains stagnate for decades. 
Decades....
8623 2018-12-02 20:45:35 Cheney believed that on the dais during the oil production caucuses of the 90's and it was there at the lounge and everybody stayed there and we had met before the cookie won all and yet cheney believes that Hano is a menace to societal mores that Trump needs to abide by.
8624 2018-12-02 20:45:34 Tragic. Burnley? Blackburn? Preston? Fleetwood? Morecambe? It’s safe to call here - we’ve got extra virgin olive oil and posh coffee. We’ll have a bath and brush the whippet. Or are we not the kind of people “People’s Vote” is aimed at? The “racist idiots” who voted Leave?

8627 2018-12-02 20:45:20 The point is, the offer to help the GM workers is not different than what was done for the oil workers. It isn't an endless helping hand, merely some help, but to hear people talk, the feds are offering the world on a silver platter to the GM workers.
8628 2018-12-02 20:45:11 Irving Oil is the only one buying Saudi oil. Getting pipe to tidewater won't change that. Saudi oil has nothing to do with the problem that Harper, in 10 years in power, never did a thing about tidewater pipe. Finally we have prov & fed govs focused on tidewater! #cdnpoli #abpoli
8629 2018-12-02 20:45:08 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

8632 2018-12-02 20:44:49 Matt Stafford is most overrated QB in NFL history.  He personally lost two games in a row.  Release him as no other team dumb enough to take him.  Horrible. Pathetic. Fire him now. Joke.  @DetroitLionsPro
8633 2018-12-02 20:44:41 Why would exports feature in GERS when there is no export tax? Oil and gas tax revenues feature in a whole section which you’ve clearly not read since you believe licensing isn’t counted when it is. Your tweet is entirely ignorant to the facts.
8634 2018-12-02 20:44:32 This is so very sad and wrong. Violence and destruction are never the answer. It merely changes the focus of discussions from the real need to address rising oil prices and living costs to anger over chaos, damage and ruin. It is self-destructive in the end and benefits no one.
8635 2018-12-02 20:44:32 And eggs in a lot of salad dressings. If you look at most butters, they are vegan (don't contain milk and are made of canola, veggie oil, olive oil, etc).

8637 2018-12-02 20:44:28 So, you mean that whole Kuwait thing (war) wasn’t actually over oil and the health (profits) of our oil industry?

8640 2018-12-02 20:44:12 Kiss tourism goodbye too.

Who wants to be sunbathing or walking on the beach littered with the rotting carcasses of sea creatures or need to clean oil off of everything just for a day at the beach.

I'm sure they can make up the money lost somewhere.
8641 2018-12-02 20:43:56 I love this. He’s so cute. If jT and @gmbutts could monetize likes and retweets, we’d have that alternate economy! No more oil. We’ll tweet our way to prosperity.
8642 2018-12-02 20:43:54  Frizz-Affliction. Solidarity.  I've tried loads of hair gunk, but John Frieda Frizz Ease Secret Weapon, and VERY judicial use of apricot oil on flyaways, both on dry hair, works for me and frizzy son. Up in a bun after drying to tame, of course. God bless the bun!
8643 2018-12-02 20:43:51 Ice, in the north, in winter. Can’t be, maybe @KHayhoe could divert the narrative to a Ca AGW prob or could drive 1.5 hr south to witness the largest and most concentrated fracking operations in the world. She is probably indirectly getting some of that Permian oil cash at TTU...
8644 2018-12-02 20:43:46 #Pakistan should send this additional  40 thousand tons of #Wheat to countries like #Venezvella either as a gift or for barter in return of oil. They are facing food shortage and inflation. We are facing trade deficit. Let’s make a new friend. @Asad_Umar
8645 2018-12-02 20:43:42 I respect the fact my former President has fallen for the lord anoints leaders of nations to their power, but I still do not like Oil tycoons and their sons who launch oil wars for their dads companies when we have the largest reserves in the world.

8648 2018-12-02 20:43:20 Everyone knows that the policies enacted towards oil drilling do not show results for many years. So the oil production surge would have been because of G.W's policy on oil drilling years earlier.
Obama hates oil drilling but takes credit for increased oil production 
Priceless

Not fast enough. Ctax not high enough and only on upstream emissions. 

Apply ctax to the product and you can brag abt being a leader.
8651 2018-12-02 20:43:03 I've been in uni for two months and have managed to burn myself with oil twice, sprain my ankle, get a high fever, forget to put lotion on my hands so they turned into the Sahara desert and cracked and now my hands have got a massive allergic reaction to who tf knows what

8677 2018-12-02 20:40:16 Very cool. Rijswijk was one of the burbs where we lived late 70s / early 80s - as you might imagine we knew a ton of oil company expats

8689 2018-12-02 20:39:00 You forget the Containment Policy which kept Iraq under bombardment & sanctions enforced throughout the period before the invasion. No fly zones; stealing Iraq oil under oil for food so reparations could be paid to the "allies". Sr. Played a big role in the destruction of Iraq
8690 2018-12-02 20:38:59 $USO $CL_F $XLE Omani Energy Minister  bin Hamad al-Rumhy said Sun. that he believed there was consensus among OPEC oil output should be cut

Russian President Vladimir Putin praised Trump, pummeled Poroshenko, and poured cold water on oil market bulls' hopes in a statement following the G-20 meetings.
8696 2018-12-02 20:38:28 Muriel it's fact that we are better off at other countries expense and that THEY die for it that enrages me. Would Afghanistan would be so poor if they had not had their oil stolen from them? Britain and the U.S.A. call them terrorists because they tried to protect their country.

I work for you and only you.
8705 2018-12-02 20:37:33 If you’re Christian, think of the loaves and fishes. Same concept. There is always enough. So, when we light candles tonight, remember the abundance of life and love we often can’t see, but should know is there. The oil is always there. We just need to have faith. 4/4
8706 2018-12-02 20:37:26 oil subsidies in the u.s. are somewhat difficult to track down, most going to the oil companies and refineries etc for 'exploration & innovation' (which still keep prices artificially low at the pump) ranges for what gas SHOULD cost without such billionare welfare suggest $10/gal

8722 2018-12-02 20:35:29 Think about our state of affairs, where our discourse and social media often talks about absolutes. ‘This is the most awful time ever.’ ‘There’s no way out.’ But the most dire predictions never prove true. They come from a lack of faith. The oil is always there. Always. 3/4
8723 2018-12-02 20:35:17 lavender - relaxation and cramps
peppermint - headache
eucalyptus - relaxation, bath oil
8724 2018-12-02 20:35:14 This is an oil and gas lobby account.
8725 2018-12-02 20:34:54 Peppermint and I use it to clear out my sinuses when u get sick. I also use it mixed with coconut oil to help relieve sunburns and it mixed with lavender to get rid of headaches
8726 2018-12-02 20:34:53 tea tree for acne , lavender for bug bites, i use one called ?stress away? for like anxiety, peppermint for tummy aches or colds & orange oil to help me relax <3
8727 2018-12-02 20:34:45 Heuristic for determining whether a cooking oil is healthy:

If it comes from a naturally fat-rich plant, it is good for you.

If it comes from a naturally fat-poor plant, lab techs had to do some godforsaken things to it to make it edible, and is likely not good for you.

8734 2018-12-02 20:33:39 I got very angry in PetCo today, so here is an unfriendly reminder that LAVENDER OIL IS TOXIC FOR CATS. If any pet hormone diffusers or sprays have lavender oil, stay away from that shit.
8735 2018-12-02 20:33:36 Some of your points are valid.
As regards, importation of petroleum products, we are being hopeful that Dangote's $12b world's largest oil refinery starts fully by 2020. Its capacity can completely take care of our demands with excess to export
8736 2018-12-02 20:33:35 A little piece of me feels less stressed after I got an oil change my tires rotated
8737 2018-12-02 20:33:34 Hanukkah recognizes the miracle when the Maccabees, with just enough oil to light the menorah for one night, found that there was plenty for 8. To me, this miracle is a sign that we have what we need. Always. The oil is always there. We just don’t always believe it 2/4
8738 2018-12-02 20:33:29 not at all surprised by the amount of people whining about the PM's comments about oil workers and the safety of women. if there's anything ab hates, it's when we defend women
8739 2018-12-02 20:33:23 Totally sound argument re: cars but I think the oil industry is still a factor because of the amount of political influence they have and the money they put into squashing reform.
8740 2018-12-02 20:33:16 Will report once I get back home. But I suspect it has enough oil in it to last my menorah some eight days!

8741 2018-12-02 20:33:13 I really wish my oil changes weren’t $75

8743 2018-12-02 20:33:11 No Derek, it’s not. Alberta doesn’t sell our oil to producers. We always retain ownership over the resource.
8744 2018-12-02 20:33:06 Well he sells us oil & buys our weapons so we are dependent on him. Henceforth we'll look the other way this time hoping he doesn't do it again. Guess TM told him just that in Argentina?
8745 2018-12-02 20:33:03 #LopezObrador, new President of #Mexico, encourages Mexicans “not to buy abroad, but to produce in Mexico what we consume,” wants new oil refiners "to develop Central America & southern Mexico, so people wouldn’t have to migrate  to address in that way the migration phenomenon.”
8746 2018-12-02 20:33:00 Nah, we buy their oil
8747 2018-12-02 20:32:55 Eh Kanin Ubanka ne zan haifa
8748 2018-12-02 20:32:52 "a leap in the wholesale price of oil worldwide"?? How ignorant do they think their audience is??
8749 2018-12-02 20:32:48 Kudos to the Miami Herald for this story.  Exploring for oil in our coastal water is outrageous, will harm sea life, and, based on previous exploration, is unlikely to turn up any oil.
8750 2018-12-02 20:32:42 Me and nick are just gonna start digging for oil, we’re buying shovels today.
8751 2018-12-02 20:32:29 Trying to explain to my husband that the reason I don't want to use truffle oil on my popcorn christmas gifts is because @chrissyteigen told me on twitter that its bad and she is my cooking god so I must believe her

8756 2018-12-02 20:31:55 Obama the same guy that tried to put coal and oil out of business and at the same time said we couldn’t have good lives while the rest of the world was depressed because of USA ? What a joke this person was.
8757 2018-12-02 20:31:48 Anyone out there use CBD oil for restless leg / anxiety that could recommend a brand?
8758 2018-12-02 20:31:43 Nothing will be done about it. As outrageous as this is he has oil. Oil is power. What should we do about it? Another proxy war? Topple the monarchy? Anything we westerners do will be critiqued by all the world, including doing nothing. We would cause international outrage again
8759 2018-12-02 20:31:42 I have a feeling you haven't spent much time in, say, ultraorthodox synagogues or oil rigs.
8760 2018-12-02 20:31:42 Trump does absolutely NOTHING for humanity and EVERYTHING for his personal profit.  Even with Mueller closing in, he's still moving forward on all his profit making schemes.  How much did big oil pay his 1000's of shell corps?  Millions?  Billions?  What's it take to buy a pres?
8761 2018-12-02 20:31:39 Cbd oil coming in clutch with the arm pains!! I was throwing like 100mph across the Diamond at my game this morning 
8762 2018-12-02 20:31:34 Venezuelan Govt pegs its currency to the US$ and carries a debt burden denominated in US$. Such debt is problematic as it must earn export revenue to service it. Its main export revenue derived from oil has collapsed due to lower oil prices.
8763 2018-12-02 20:31:31 His car sure has been leaking oil as of late....hope he gets that checked out
8764 2018-12-02 20:31:30 "Canada" did not spend anything on oil.  Canada does not buy oil.  Private companies buy crude refine it and sell for a profit.  They want to max profits so they buy the cheapest feedstock.  It is called capitilism it is a bad system but better than the alternatives.
8765 2018-12-02 20:31:24 Because not everyone wants to work in the Oil & Gas industry, engineering is a huge field but it’s limited to O&G in Oman :)
8766 2018-12-02 20:31:21 Better still is shipping oil from the middle east on tankers no threat to our coast there, think Senator ,and drop the hate.
8767 2018-12-02 20:31:16 You trust Iran. That is very foolish. Their policy is to lie and cheat. The oil capacity has been there for decades. Obama made it less. Trump unleashed Anwar. Obama built nothing. Ever. He set the nation back 10 trillion in debt. He destroys like all socialists.

8769 2018-12-02 20:31:01 In recent homeowner learnings, we’ve caught a couple of mice. I just went around the outside perimeters of our house and sprayed peppermint oil and now that’s all I smell. At least it’s kind of #Christmas-y? 
8770 2018-12-02 20:30:48 Buddy. Peppermint oil. Steam. Take a decongestant. And blow your damn nose. No sniffling.
8771 2018-12-02 20:30:46 Whip together 2 cups cheese with 1/3 cup Rice. Mix in Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve warm.
8772 2018-12-02 20:30:33 Yup! If you can afford them, because they’re getting ridiculously expensive, Jersey Bennies. Agrias are great all-purpose spuds, but they’re not the best here. I also cut the mayonnaise with lemon juice and a little olive oil. Oh, and we add baby green peas and chopped chives.
8773 2018-12-02 20:30:31 Using coconut oil morning and night and sleep with a du-rag or bonnet lol to keep the moisture in... don’t wash everyday maybe once a week also hot oil treatments monthly can help

8791 2018-12-02 20:29:24 And yet our president,alone among the western leaders,still denies climate change! And he continues to repeal or eliminate environmental protections like allowing oil companies to use sonic blasts to explore the ocean floor for oil, which will be catastrophic for  whales.
8792 2018-12-02 20:29:17 Ugh I can't find that essential oil recipe that @HeyFranHey gave for seasonal depression. I don't remember which episode of @FriendZonePod she gave us a few recipes on from @AuraCacia. I think it had frankincense, myrrh and lemon?!
8793 2018-12-02 20:29:06 I’m dreading getting this oil change cause that means I gotta do my emissions test and renew this damn sticker
8794 2018-12-02 20:28:58 The fishing Boats didn’t they use oil while going out fishing? The problem is universal, as is the guilt and the blame.
8795 2018-12-02 20:28:52 I guess @montesolberg you never worked on an oil rig or stayed at one for a few days. Drugs, porn, sexual predation on nearby women - yeah, its part of being a man. If that makes you happy and think its what a man should be. #cdnpoli

8802 2018-12-02 20:27:36 Rachel Notley's upcoming announcement, to cut back on oil production in Canada to combat dropping prices, is the lesser of two evils. Paying more for gasoline at the pumps will be a lot less painful than the collapse of Canada's oil industry.
8803 2018-12-02 20:27:33 I would of tries soaking the stickers in baby oil or oil they put on leather to keep it from cracking. This is very unfortunate. =<

8807 2018-12-02 20:27:28 Much lower pay ( for trade) plenty of say ( Norway only Accepts rules it wants - refuses rules on oil industry) no ECJ at all - different court on which we would have judges - FOM can be controlled ! Better than PM deal
8808 2018-12-02 20:27:28 Hey @JustinTrudeau how about fixing the oil pipeline issue? How can we still import oil for foreign countries when we could build EnergyEast? It's safer, more economical and create jobs in Canada!...

8811 2018-12-02 20:26:47 Wasn't an extension of EI benefits one of the first things the Federal Liberals did in 2015 for oil industry workers who were affected by the downturn?

8816 2018-12-02 20:26:04 Yeah, go ahead and do this crap while there's a glut of oil on the market and we're tapping in to cleaner energy to help stave off climate change...god I hate Trump.
8817 2018-12-02 20:25:59 Or "stand up" either way he's leaking oil
8818 2018-12-02 20:25:57 I need someone to do a oil change for me
8819 2018-12-02 20:25:53 we elected them to diversify our economy, so we wouldn’t go through another oil bust. to invest in clean energy and the jobs that go with it, and incidentally making sure our kids have clean air to breathe. it doesn’t happen with a magic wand.
8820 2018-12-02 20:25:53 The main reason that Bush jr. invaded Iraq was because his daddy didn't get Saddam Hussein the first time and then Saddam insulted him. Well that and oil money.

8823 2018-12-02 20:25:28 Can’t personally vouch for either but some swear by raspberry leaf tea and/or massaging your tummy with almond oil with a couple of drops of rose or ylang ylang essential oil in.
8824 2018-12-02 20:25:24 There are so many things wrong with that post. In fact, there are more things wrong than there are types of OIL.
8825 2018-12-02 20:25:23 I know someone who used the oil for pain!   It definitely helped.  I have 5 acres in Oregon and don’t want to grow marijuana but was thinking about hemp.  Do you know anything about growing it?
8826 2018-12-02 20:25:20 @ai_maij...Ameen ya Allah
8827 2018-12-02 20:25:18 For the simple reason it is not cost effective. Plus, China controls the price of rare earth minerals. 
If solar panels were more cost effective than coal and oil we would drop it in a minute.
8828 2018-12-02 20:25:17 I will comb that red hair and oil it like kilode.
8829 2018-12-02 20:25:16 Oil is an animal product. Vegans should not be using fossil fuel powered transport.
8830 2018-12-02 20:25:15 A better idea would be to build oil pipeline in Alberta and stop stifling jobs in Canada.  Edmonton and Calgary had among the highest unemployment rates in Canadian cities measured in July, both sitting at 8.5 per cent. About 70,000 people in the Edmonton area are out of work.
8831 2018-12-02 20:25:09 This largely matches what I hear on the Canadian prairies. Here it starts out about oil pipelines, but keep talking to them (usually with beer...I'm not a political volunteer) and it quickly becomes apparent that want a return to the social norms of a century ago.

8836 2018-12-02 20:24:56 Oil is in a bear market wtf?
8837 2018-12-02 20:24:55 It strikes me that it is a failure of the media in not properly explaining: After all, it is not a crisis rooted in benchmark oil price volatility, but one that is rooted in too much oil bidding on the same limited pipeline capacity to get out of Alberta and out to markets.
8838 2018-12-02 20:24:53 argan oil is the bomb!!

8842 2018-12-02 20:24:47 woke up to December welcoming us with blankets of snow.. tired eyes pulled some shots of espresso and made dirty chai, finished making salves with the oil I’ve been infusing with juniper and sage.. slow mornings sometimes feel like dreams
8843 2018-12-02 20:24:43 My point is the ethical oil argument is brought to you by the same people who sold them weapons.
8844 2018-12-02 20:24:43 The turkey wish badly if they know then about oil _ but it shows the real values they believe in _ We will never trust them
8845 2018-12-02 20:24:41 Happy #Hanukkah! The oil will last and the light will continue! חנוכה שמח

8848 2018-12-02 20:24:09 What happened to the Natural Light? Were you just beer signaling about Natural Light?
8849 2018-12-02 20:24:03 Thanks Becky. This stuff smells amazing. I may need a refund though, because Mr L has already told me that my ‘magic oil’ is completely unnecessary because I’m already enough just as I am. And I won’t mention that he called NHD Daddy McSpunkface 
8850 2018-12-02 20:24:03 cars would be less of an issue if we stopped catering to them and really forced efficiency requirements. modern engines can do much better but there's too much big oil & big car money in leaving things as is. oil likes it and big auto does not want to spend on development.
8851 2018-12-02 20:24:01 The meds really changed his personality so we took him off them, what really helped was changing to grain free food. I’ve heard good things about CBD oil too.
8852 2018-12-02 20:23:56 Thinking I’m going to rent #Searching for Carol Lorraine & I to check out later. Anyone seen it? Is she going to be scared & pouring twice blessed oil all over the damn house????
8853 2018-12-02 20:23:52 It's all about the different fryer oil they have. If I wanted to fry a goblin, I would use the fryer at the Mall Arby's, because its flavor profile is subtly better than the Freeway one!
8854 2018-12-02 20:23:38 Oil Marketers Issued a 7day Ultimatum, demanding that the FG Settle the Outstanding Debts Totalling N800 Billion.

8856 2018-12-02 20:23:33 I had that shit bad drink plenty water and don’t wash yo hair everyday condition it everyday and use coconut oil
8857 2018-12-02 20:23:28 "you can’t go from selling oil to selling wooden chopsticks overnight."

Overnight, no, but in the almost 30 years where energy has gone from a $24b industry to an $83b, they had time to start selling chopsticks, plates, and a whole bunch of other stuff.
8858 2018-12-02 20:23:20 no more Americans should die for your proxy war propaganda 

No. More. Wars. For. Oil.
8859 2018-12-02 20:23:06 Just finished this exact same pregame meal.  Used a smoking hot cast iron skillet with a small bit of canola oil after the sous vide.  Perfect crust.
8860 2018-12-02 20:23:03 Thanks to that sorry azz, I lost my job out in the oil fields! Then lost my health in a work accident in some po-dunk band-aid job! F-Bomb that clown trying to take credit for that!
8861 2018-12-02 20:22:52 someone take this oil pen away from me bc i continued holding my umbrella while waiting for the train UNDERGROUND
8862 2018-12-02 20:22:30 Kwaaaaaa anoida iyoyi oil inogwamba mupoto ichiri pastove i doubt tht
8863 2018-12-02 20:22:28 Thanks mike I'm changing the oil and putting a plug in the snowblower...
8864 2018-12-02 20:22:28 Fast for the planet this Advent

Turn off a light
Walk to the shop
Use public transport
Eat less meat
Avoid palm oil
Wear an extra jumper
8865 2018-12-02 20:22:21 I won't argue that they've fought against recent developments, but in the 20th century coal and oil were the cleaner alternative.  Also, most of the rest of us are still responsible for not adapting to cleaner technologies already.  We stayed with the old because it was cheaper.
8866 2018-12-02 20:22:04 This is what happens when you leave your parentheses unclosed, you start going off in a weird tangent about oil or some shit.
8867 2018-12-02 20:22:02 Sounds like a team player, l want, we want, the people want, the province wants, keeping immigration under control and keep isis out. Pipe lines also for Alberta so they can sell oil like Putin of Russia make the money for Alberta so they can share with the have not in the east..
8868 2018-12-02 20:21:45 Obviously you did just ask #GM employees or those in #Alberta's oil and gas sector your party could screw up a one non gas using car parade
8869 2018-12-02 20:21:39 Chris downed her first scotch of the day. It was nearly noon, if quarter past ten could be called nearly. She started putting the .45 back together, the smell of gun oil sharp in her nose. It barely beat the wafting of perfume which meant trouble stood at her door.
8870 2018-12-02 20:21:39 Okay ke we've heard Mr Baby Oil, Miss I Shout Into a Mic and Pharrell. Can Beyoncé come back now.
8871 2018-12-02 20:21:36 I guess you've never worked in an oil rig camp. Porn and drugs are commonplace. Men (even married ones) have sex with women in nearby towns. This is in AB. Imagine a country where moral standards don't meet yours Mr. Scheer. #cdnpoli #ABLeg #abpoli
8872 2018-12-02 20:21:31 Hmmm....So is this tweet directed at uninformed people who don't know the crude oil rates have reduced by more than 30% in the market?

What do you think we are? Andhe Bhakts?
8873 2018-12-02 20:21:25 I can only assume you r acting out since I don't think you're ignorant about close UAE-Ethiopia relations. They brokered the Eritrea-Ethiopia peace deal n now revampin Asmara port, plannin oil pipeline frm Eth to Eritrea, injected $1bn 2 Eth economy 2 ease foreign exchange crisis
8874 2018-12-02 20:21:20 JT never ceases to amaze me. Good thing our deficit will take care of itself and our veterans and unemployed oil workers don’t need any assistance.
8875 2018-12-02 20:21:20 @cathmckenna said the same thing about oil and gas workers.
8876 2018-12-02 20:21:17 Thanks Graeme, I won’t be purchasing any items containing palm oil regardless of source. And will be campaigning to get palm oil removed from vegan labelled foods
8877 2018-12-02 20:21:17 Commercial operations of mining, oil, research & tourism companies have made the situation worst. Human being is the big threat for other inhabitants of this universe
8878 2018-12-02 20:21:14 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
8879 2018-12-02 20:21:08 I found this shop on Etsy with homemade soaps and scrubs etc, but I got him this beard balm/oil that smells pretty good, he likes to keep his beard in the winter. Nothing too fancy
8880 2018-12-02 20:21:06 I would use the export permitting laws to reduce export to the US especially the west coast, get oil flowing over TMX to leave the continent, push Suncor to use only AB oil at eastern refineries, engage TCP to convert gas pipe to Ont, EB line 5 risks, export frm TB, TO or Mtl
8881 2018-12-02 20:21:00 My technique, is to heat it in a microwave, just until the cheese is remelted and then put it in a hot skilled on the stove, with a bit of oil in it and a lid on it.
The skillet and oil makes the crust nice and crispy and the preheating in the microwave ensures that it's all hot.
8882 2018-12-02 20:20:56 Looks like the French scramble to retain Gabon's oil isn't working fast enough.
8883 2018-12-02 20:20:55 i argued ill be left w/o my computer for about three months and my mother said “well you can go back to oil painting, maybe finish your 7384 pieces left here incomplete” and it’s true but also. mom....

8888 2018-12-02 20:20:24 Please call pastor Johnson on 08023280012. He deals in organic coconut oil.
8889 2018-12-02 20:20:23 Yeah yeah yeah we might get another referendum or labour who sign us up to a customs union. In either scenario Brexiteers would offer nothing but decades of civil disobedience. The gloves would come off. Endless blockades of ports, oil refinaires and motorways.

8892 2018-12-02 20:20:03 "Rising fuel prices are largely attributed to a leap in the wholesale price of oil worldwide."

You FAKE NEWS guys don't really ever check what you write do you?
8893 2018-12-02 20:19:55 Nothing to worry about Claire, our current leaders are way above the last batch of conservatives who only cared about Alberta oil.
8894 2018-12-02 20:19:55 Oil check it out!
8895 2018-12-02 20:19:53 Why would anybody want to demonize Muslims? Muslims want to kill everyone that is not a muslim. Most muslims live off welfare . Muslims kill one another far more often than anyone else. If not for oil they would still be riding camels across the desert .
8896 2018-12-02 20:19:52 Ernest Borgnine's wive Madame Tova sold a witche's cream back in the 50s... It was fetal cream from Mexico-black market abortions.. It wasn't long before Oil of Olay came sniffing around..& by the 60s abortion was the new thing.
8897 2018-12-02 20:19:41 He sure does.  Even when he totes and takes credit for anything oil or petroleum related.
8898 2018-12-02 20:19:22 Stay and kill the bad guys. We don’t need another 9/11. People have short memories. 9/11 was terrifying for people along the Gulf Coast working at refineries, chemical facilities, and natural ga / oil distribution strategic points.

8902 2018-12-02 20:19:01 Plz do write something about it and tag me. I would love to read that. Yesterday i was reading about algeria. They have huge oil and gas resources. They have almost zero external debt and forex reserve of of 3 years of import=$150 billion+

8908 2018-12-02 20:18:23 All of this would have to be subtracted from U.K. debt before iScots share was calculated, in addition a calculation should be made based on the surplus of oil revenues over the yrs
8909 2018-12-02 20:18:19 Less common than LCHF bashing by the experts. These experts do help to sell JUNK OIL and wholegrain stupidity as HEALTHY and keep rehashing same thing over and over again while shamelessly watching Diabetes and obesity grow every year. More moola for experts than in books.
8910 2018-12-02 20:18:17 Try sliced onions at the bottom of a crock pot or roast pot. After you brown the seasoned meat on all sides in a pan with oil, place on top of the onions, cover and slow cook (8 hrs in crock pot) 2 hrs in the oven.
8911 2018-12-02 20:18:17 The oil burns forever Sir.
8912 2018-12-02 20:18:15 Alaskans own 69,068 shares of PBF ENERGY INC, worth $1,531,238. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.
8913 2018-12-02 20:18:12 Ugh girl I’m the worst at remembering putting lotion on lol !!! I just use coconut oil but I have lots of stretch marks since my first baby
8914 2018-12-02 20:18:10 MCJDNDNSHDJDJDADNDJS id do both tbh? i love oil portraits i only stopped selling them bc of uni 
you’d only have the trouble to either get me there OR attach the canvas to a wooden frame.......... i don’t trust the mailing companies it’s safer to send the roll of canvas HSJDH
8915 2018-12-02 20:17:51 Donald is trying to destroy our Country.   I just hope and pray that Mueller can take him down quickly before anything else goes wrong. 

The testing for oil on our East Coast should be stopped.  DT has absolutely no feelings for our people or our Country.
8916 2018-12-02 20:17:48 For some reason I forgot that when you get your oil changed they vacuum the inside of your car, and now I'm embarrassed  #mycarsgross #sorry
8917 2018-12-02 20:17:31 The alternative to oil isn't wood, it's solar and wind and we could've spent the last three decades developing them if it weren't for the fossil fuel industry's interference. They aren't responsible for everything, but they are sure as shit responsible for what they did.
8918 2018-12-02 20:17:26 spent 5 minutes explaining to this chick at a farmers market why her vegan bone broth isn’t keto and then got a high five for bringing my own mct oil and frother into the cafe and then another dude asked what my frother was so it turns out i’m too LA for LA
8919 2018-12-02 20:17:24 They have these THC Capsules and its just cannabis oil in a pill. Very convenient.
8920 2018-12-02 20:17:24 Real and fake don't mix oil and water
8921 2018-12-02 20:17:01 Trump tower chump change.
Siberian shale oil technology deal for Exxon ALSO required sanctions be lifted and made General Flynn lose his mind trying to get backchannel to Putin for Tillerson.
8922 2018-12-02 20:16:55 Coconut oil
8923 2018-12-02 20:16:46 I’m confused too but this woman is the reason I sweated my edges out w that last bit. So at least I have time to oil them before they melt away. 
8924 2018-12-02 20:16:40 Spot on mate!! There really should be a benefit to producing all that oil but there just isn’t!!
8925 2018-12-02 20:16:35 Gorgeous! Thanks tremendously for sharing the photo. I mixed flour and yeast together early, then added in 300 mL of water and some oil and salt. For good measure, a big handful of chopped walnuts. Dough is rising above the fireplace now!  Let's see what happens next 
8926 2018-12-02 20:16:27 I’d like everyone to know that I just used coconut oil while caulking my bathroom sink. There is literally nothing that stuff can’t be used for.
8927 2018-12-02 20:16:07 Guys coconut oil can be bad for skin idk but i only use it for eyebrows and lips
8928 2018-12-02 20:16:00 I second that! Get big money OUT of politics forever. The government works for the American people, NOT big pharma, big oil (insert other big interests that are only concerned with getting rich off of our sweat here)

8930 2018-12-02 20:15:59 I have to take a med that isn't covered by my insurance if I get a migraine and let me tell you, if peppermint oil actually worked I would be all over it.
8931 2018-12-02 20:15:48 やっぱりシンプルなのが一番！
8932 2018-12-02 20:15:44 The oil we sell is in a squirt bottle that you put under your tongue. We haven't heard of any complaints about nausea with our product. That may be because ours is orange flavored and others have the real dirt taste!
8933 2018-12-02 20:15:31 I go through food spurts where I fall in love with something and just eat it a ton. Right now it's arugula salad with a little fresh squeezed lemon, a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and some shaved asiago cheese. Sometimes I even eat it with my breakfast.
8934 2018-12-02 20:15:18 As you should. I put on perfume or at least body oil even if I hv on tights and a T-shirt!!!

8940 2018-12-02 20:14:48 OPEC is losing their leverage over the US slowly.  They are already slowing oil production, and we can make them do so because North America is energy self-sufficient.  A loss of 15% imports at worst from the ME would be felt, but no a death blow to the economy.
8941 2018-12-02 20:14:43 NO! NO! NO! This is so wrong & cruel on every level...have we lost all respect for Mother Earth & her creatures...come on each & every one of the gas & oil exploration companies out there...DO NOT DO THIS, I’M BEGGING YOU...
8942 2018-12-02 20:14:38 How are real people to stop the unmitigated, open greed of the oil & gas corporations. 
How long can we go on like this?  It's like trying to tell an alcoholic "if you lose your body, where will you live" -
8943 2018-12-02 20:14:36 Modi in 50 hours in Argentina participated in G20...he met Saudi prince one o one for india' oil requirement ...he met xi jinping one o one ...in trilateral meeting, Modi  met Japan' Abe & Trump in what Modi called as JAI ...After 12 years,
8944 2018-12-02 20:14:34 I’m wearing my sawdust scented beard oil and I can only assume this is how Ron Swanson smells all the time.
8945 2018-12-02 20:14:31 i don’t want to put coconut oil on my nips at night because i don’t want ants to eat them.... i guess i could just do it in the morning it’s not really that big of a deal

8948 2018-12-02 20:14:15 Sir,Crude oil price is on downward trend!India and other world nation's should not allow Crude oil price to exceed 40$!This Saudi Arabia and other Arab nation's have looted the entire world and advanced themselves by selling natural resource common to all.
8949 2018-12-02 20:14:07 I invite you to look at Norway a free democracy that allows all oil companies to drill for their oil but a %age of it goes into the countries pension funds for ALL their people. The oil in the grounds belong to ALL future people included. Not just Exxon or BP, Shell.For Example!
8950 2018-12-02 20:14:02 They (Feds, UNIFOR) will explore every option to keep oil transportation to a minimum
8951 2018-12-02 20:13:59 @CookingIssues for the guy who called in last week for spec on Portuguese fermented hot sauce: blend/grind peppers (plus opt few % garlic) mix with 3% salt, after fermentation cut with 10% olive oil. Piri-Piri is different, not fermented but oil infused with chilis/herbs/cachaça.
8952 2018-12-02 20:13:55 Olive oil for hair before shower
8953 2018-12-02 20:13:52 There are forces here that promote similar North/South America Union. The cultural and economic disruption would be disastrous. Many view EU as similar to Soviet Union in some ways and we want no part of it as well as unrestricted migration.
8954 2018-12-02 20:13:47 Yes~ with some lavender oil being diffused in the room and you’re just reading or relaxing.

8962 2018-12-02 20:12:38 Dinner idea! Seitan steak and napa cabbage baked with quality sea-salt. Serve on top of ciabatta in olive oil.
8963 2018-12-02 20:12:32 i told andy that in our future hous ei dont want photos i want commissioned portraits and he's down so if youre an oil painter hmu
8964 2018-12-02 20:12:29 -And next, they're going to try vegetable oil, then...baby oil.
8965 2018-12-02 20:12:28 Also the crypto bounce so far has been mediocre rather like recent bounces in oil
8966 2018-12-02 20:12:22 your making me want to play the mod that removes all oil
8967 2018-12-02 20:12:17 Independent media is helping expose these travesties. It's an embarrassment to realize how manipulated and ignorant we have been. Oil represents destruction and death..
8968 2018-12-02 20:12:17 Here ,let me announce it for you...NO MORE OIL !
8969 2018-12-02 20:12:13 In college, my yoga instructor would pass around lavender oil to put on our eye pillows before we did on of our poses.
8970 2018-12-02 20:12:12 I can go on. He as no real leadership, no idea how to do diplomacy, negotiate trade, panders to extremists, virtue signals for votes, plays identity politics,wastes Billions of dollars, only cares about foreigners not Canadians (I’m an immigrant), carbon tax, killing oil industry
8971 2018-12-02 20:12:03 I call that Fridge Rice or Trash Rice. Take everything that's about to go bad in the fridge and add it to rice with some soy sauce and sesame oil.
8972 2018-12-02 20:12:02 I like that people think that the conservatives are gonna be voted in next election, the oil boom is gonna start again, and everyone can snort their money away again loool.
8973 2018-12-02 20:12:01 Different grades of oil get different pricing.  But to answer your question, over the past 10-15 years, WCS has averaged ~27% discount to WTI.  Current discount is closer to 75%.  Other grades are also being discounted more than their historical averages, but not as much as WCS.
8974 2018-12-02 20:12:01 In the same event. I would put my money on the fact that he simply didn’t hear it, which is no surprise because of the noise and commotion in the building. In fact I would put my money on. You won’t find a more professional and knowledgeable announcing team in the business.
8975 2018-12-02 20:12:00 He served in wartime, in harms way. He gave up the opportunity to take advantage of his family’s wealth & position selling tools in Bakersfield to learn & start an oil business. This article is garbage.
8976 2018-12-02 20:11:54 The oil company are the cause of most wars, too...that leads to
all the injured, deceased and HOMELESS VETERANS...so many
of them, sleeping in shelters, streets.

Look at them: They don't even want to treat the Veterans right,
even though 59% of our tax $$$ goes to the Pentagon.
8977 2018-12-02 20:11:47 Just goes to show that moving to another team can make a difference. Glad to have him with the Oil. Hitch looks right at home behind that bench too.
8978 2018-12-02 20:11:41 Any guesses as to how cdn oil and gas stocks react with a restriction on production? I could make a case for both sides. Short term pain for long term gain. Hard to know what investors will focus on but given how beat down certain names are any action might help.
8979 2018-12-02 20:11:23 I love putting lavender on my pillow and in my oil diffuser to help me sleep. I use orange for when I’m getting sick
8980 2018-12-02 20:11:18 Itna coconut oil laga dia hai baalon mein, abhi bhi achay nai huay tou phir se bleach kar du gi.
8981 2018-12-02 20:11:16 Doin free oil changes 2marr dm me for info
8982 2018-12-02 20:11:12 How shameful they use the job cutting keystone project as a false example. That kills jobs the oil should move by train!
8983 2018-12-02 20:11:06 !!! كنا هناك وشفنا اللي صار وكل العالم قاعد تستنكر اللي صار وتقولي شوية مصداقيه!!
8984 2018-12-02 20:11:01 I don't see that they alone are responsible though.  I mean, burning wood is far less efficient than burning fossil fuels, which is what billions of us would be doing without coal and oil.  We all need to change our ways.
8985 2018-12-02 20:10:57 Hey @Rainbow6Game can you give an operator one of those fr*cking oil can suppressors
8986 2018-12-02 20:10:56 Use thicker weight oil
8987 2018-12-02 20:10:51 He'd stop after a few minutes, taking a step back.

"I'm going to picture you, swinging a sledgehammer in short shorts. Covered in baby oil. Tonight."
8988 2018-12-02 20:10:45 I sure you that we do not omit sponsors because of an event sponsored. I Will say that we don’t always mentioned any of the sponsors pending on the portion of the night in which we are announcing. No need to state the obvious after seeing the same car on the track more than three
8989 2018-12-02 20:10:43 Just cause Trump is breaking another promise does not mean stocks or oil prices are going to go up. It only means he does not know what he is doing, and us trying to control something he has no clue about. We will see tomorrow.
8990 2018-12-02 20:10:40 Ah, we get the "chicken fried in peanut oil greatness" Bowl.
8991 2018-12-02 20:10:19 見回り行ってきまーす！
8992 2018-12-02 20:10:18 It was a great re:Invent this year, but a lot of customers don’t know that this is because many of us burnt the midnight oil, working early mornings, evenings, and even Saturdays on content.
8993 2018-12-02 20:10:13 Are you saying those that work in the oil and gas industry aren't skilled?
8994 2018-12-02 20:10:09 Bruhz grilling tonight for SWAC and my LB birthday @Yung_J6  y’all goin to pull up?  Oil there too 
8995 2018-12-02 20:10:06 しげるちゃん
8996 2018-12-02 20:10:03 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
8997 2018-12-02 20:10:03 Banks own the oil, media, & our Government, they fund both sides of war, the Military Industrial Complex & Federal Reserve Banking Cartel are responsible for most of this world's suffering. Remove money from politics & uphold our founder's constitution & keep religion out as well
8998 2018-12-02 20:09:58 As the sun emerges daily, so does Indian Oil..!! Tirelessly serving India every day since 1964..!! :)
8999 2018-12-02 20:09:53 I added you to my following Patriot! Welcome from Oil City to Johnstown! 
9000 2018-12-02 20:09:51 Gary Woodland.  You are not worthy of the title pro golfer. Complete choke artist !!  Worse than Hossler. The only happiness you bring me is the money u are hemorrhaging.  You cost me $10,000 not finishing top 5.  Pathetic. Joke.  Retire. Go away. Hide. @GaryWoodland @PGATOUR
9001 2018-12-02 20:09:46 Oil is 25 percent of Canadas GDP. We lose that then we will be third world country overnight!!
9002 2018-12-02 20:09:40 If anybody needs a gift idea for me, ya girl needs an oil change
9003 2018-12-02 20:09:40 God's sake @McVities, why? Just why do you need to use palm oil to make #JaffaCakes,
9004 2018-12-02 20:09:38 @News24 GOOD movement comes from drinking castor oil!
9005 2018-12-02 20:09:26 We love our being at the Fabrica Aurora. Here are three more pices that sold this week. Two by ceramic artists Jane Bingham, and an oil painting by Karen Lee Dunn.
9006 2018-12-02 20:09:20 "It's gotta be, right?" He sliced own down the middle, causing the two halves fall apart, sparks and oil flying into the air from the machine's broken parts. "I mean, if you were hiding a big robot making machine isn't this where you'd put it?"
9007 2018-12-02 20:09:18 Like I said, watch the video & let Sturgeon explain it to you in her own words.

As for "Oil?" - the oil revenue forecast baked into the 2014 White Paper proved to be wrong in the order of 1000%. You'll never get a majority of Scottish voters to listen to such suggestions again.
9008 2018-12-02 20:09:15 That's what happens to your brain when you submerge it in ultra left wing environut anti oil "articles".This has nothing to do with "toxic masculinity" it's just another front funded by foreign anti oil groups to stop Western Canada oil
9009 2018-12-02 20:09:11 I use peppermint oil on my temples to help with headaches! Just make sure to dilute it in a carrier oil because that shit will burn if you don’t
9010 2018-12-02 20:09:08 Are you connecting the price of oil to the Russia Saudis High five 

#peakoil
9011 2018-12-02 20:09:07 #HappyHanukkah Festival of Lights. A reminder that as oil burned for 8 nights so should our Faith.
9012 2018-12-02 20:08:43 I’m certainly not offended by your comments Alex but I can assure you after have been the announcer at the chili bowl for over 15 years and have announced most if not all of the biggest races N sprint car racing as well as other duties associated to professional Motorsports I can
9013 2018-12-02 20:08:36 Rosehip oil over everything.
9014 2018-12-02 20:08:26 Amin
9015 2018-12-02 20:08:24 I wouldn’t sip bitumen either  Do you have any links that I could read about that? First time I’ve heard about diluted bitumen and that it “floats”.  #knowledgeispower  looks like oil production is being cut, Alta needs to think about #RenewableEnergy
9016 2018-12-02 20:08:18 Amin amin
9017 2018-12-02 20:08:18 And lo, though they thought they only had enough oil for one charge...
9018 2018-12-02 20:08:10 We don't need gov't handouts just like farmers, miners, and oil workers don't need gov't handouts.  SK taxpayers spent $1.5 billion on a carbon capture project to keep a couple of hundred coal mining jobs.  Spending a couple of million a year on 1000-2000 film jobs is a deal.
9019 2018-12-02 20:08:05 We all know, he says he doesn't believe it bc he wants to continue to drill, drill & drill some more for coal & oil, the "dirty" way to go. We want the clean stuff, solar and wind! The only way to get the clean stuff is to get him out of office. GO, DEMOCRATS! 
9020 2018-12-02 20:07:54 Allah yaji kansa
9021 2018-12-02 20:07:37 ok. am i right to think--

$ strength more of a concern recently
# of reasons to have less fear of oil prices spikes than even 10 years ago
Fed undershooting target suggests not so wimpy
no evidence mon policy caution on account of debt levels... even as debt to GDP 
9022 2018-12-02 20:07:32 Keep lying to yourself...nothing in GDP or manufacturing growth supports your "super-charged" economy, although the annual deficit sure is. While you can give some credence to the free market killing coal and promoting NG over oil, 45 admin has actively tried to save coal and oil
9023 2018-12-02 20:07:29 Yes, and his company is connected to PCG. Essentially it is her family attempt to capitalizing on CA's push to 100% renewable energy. Missed Oil and Gas power grab so push "global warming" to monopolize the solar energy boom. She isn't alone..
9024 2018-12-02 20:07:17 Recently I've heard that gas prices in Italy are $7 per gallon! Us in the United States are paying less than $3 a gallon and complaining can you imagine what the Italians are doing? Oil prices should go down not up we've seen this 4 years& the ones that's rich are oil companies!
9025 2018-12-02 20:07:13 I’m pro oil bud! I can not live with out it. Neither can you. My ears go def when I hear anyone think that we can live with out it.
9026 2018-12-02 20:07:12 Imagine tokenizing an oil company or a gold mine........ Cause we did #cryptonews #directcrypt #bigmoves #investing
9027 2018-12-02 20:07:07 Vegetable oil>>>>>> skin care routine.
9028 2018-12-02 20:07:03 i got bio oil... this shit better fix my skin (or else)
9029 2018-12-02 20:06:55 lavender for calming, and hair growth
mix a few drops w coconut n castor oil.
lemon as an anti-bacterial/septic
argan is not an essential oil but works great as a moisturizer without clogging ur pores!
jasmine, eucalyptus are great tho, for calming. tea tree is great for acne
9030 2018-12-02 20:06:47 when are we going to talk about palm oil and what’s happening to our planet and the animals because of it ??? just wondering
9031 2018-12-02 20:06:39 Could a shipping terminal in Lake Ontario take oil to Quebec, NB and Europe? I think that could mend relations and employ laid off auto workers.
9032 2018-12-02 20:06:28 They DID, eventually. But only because it was OIL, which anyone could obtain on their own property.

But that is not true of all products or resources.
9033 2018-12-02 20:06:21 Ok but green onions, white pepper, sesame oil (if not included), and a egg? 3 star Michelin
9034 2018-12-02 20:06:18 I forget how nice it is to exfoliate, use a ton of peppermint shower gel then smother myself in body oil/put rosehip on my face. 

My Leo moon is smug and glowing right now.
9035 2018-12-02 20:06:17 Lift plus wipes or spray works well, as does baby oil.
9036 2018-12-02 20:06:04 My cat doesn’t like Oreos. An anti-palm oil king 
9037 2018-12-02 20:05:41 @DomPlihon @TrouveAurelie l’ ETS vise à mettre à égalité les entreprises en concurrence internationale avec leurs concurrents européens. Dire que tant qu’on ne met pas ces entreprises au même montant de taxe que les ménages me semble condamner de fait la fiscalité carbone
9038 2018-12-02 20:05:29 Oil? Seems yo be attributed to anonymous origins. How many Scottish exports leave via English ports? Just let England dump Scotland as they believe we cost them so much.
9039 2018-12-02 20:05:29 No, once again: people consume as far as corporations will allow. Waste is the issue, not the consumption. We're not consuming that many barrels of oil, so why the hell are we pumping this? See what I'm saying?
9040 2018-12-02 20:05:23 3. If it was a free market then anyone could have innovated away from what standard oil was dominating as well. People could choose to use or not use or use a competitor, etc etc ad nauseum. That's not a monopoly.

And that's how natural monopolies are just a myth.
9041 2018-12-02 20:05:19 Mitigation and reversal of climate change will only become possible once we fuel our machines from sources other than carbon. It is the machines not our coal, oil or gas that is the cause of our dilemma. It is our machines
9042 2018-12-02 20:05:16 Oil spills on the east coast coming soon? Hundreds of miles of beaches destroyed for decades?
9043 2018-12-02 20:05:16 Steven chu lied about designing the BP oil well fix,It was me.
9044 2018-12-02 20:05:12 Engine blew he hit a dip and oil pan cane off
9045 2018-12-02 20:05:11 Alberta oil no matter what it sells for and all the pipelines in the world is not going to save this province or Canada’s economy. Oil is not the only economic driving engine get with it.
9046 2018-12-02 20:05:04 Grapefruit peppermint and lavender.  I like to make a linen spray w/lavender , and I add grapefruit and peppermint oil to my diffuser during the day. I also mix grapefruit and peppermint with baking soda and sprinkle it on my carpet and vacuum it off for deoderizing!
9047 2018-12-02 20:04:45 1. Irrelevant. The government did not regulate or subsidize Standard Oil at the time.

2. No, consumers did not. If you wanted petroleum products, you bought them from Standard Oil, which had a 90% lock on the market.

Read about it.
9048 2018-12-02 20:04:33 I was never a fan of GHWB, but he never went to Wall Street (the Texas oil patch is different), never went to the Senate, and only went into Foreign Service after military and business success. Yes, he had a favorable start in life, but he did not rest on his inheritance.
9049 2018-12-02 20:04:29 I think that for the most part, the US is adapting to climate change. It just so happens that the party in power has no desire to end our dependency on oil. Once these criminals are out we will bring some sanity back into our dealings with climate change.
9050 2018-12-02 20:04:21 Oil workers,GM workers need that money in Canada.
9051 2018-12-02 20:04:16 @NavdeepSBains also says look at the great tax incentives we have given Alberta's oil sector...to do what exactly...build more storage for the oil we can't already get to market. @CPC_HQ @jkenney we need you in 2019.
9052 2018-12-02 20:04:14 6 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, “A [d]quart of wheat for a [e]denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.”
9053 2018-12-02 20:04:08 Donald Trump didn't write any of that, it was about Donald Trump not by him. HW was a greedy, power hungry, NWO globalist who wanted to be the first president of the world. HW was an oil baron who jailed one country's leader & killed another to protect his own personal finances.
9054 2018-12-02 20:04:07 May I mis heard the one time I could actually hear you guys lol. But this is literally a bunch of  over nothing. I just want to have fun racing midgets in my free time.
9055 2018-12-02 20:04:02 You can put either baby oil or baby powder in the knot as lubricant to untangle them easier
9056 2018-12-02 20:03:54 Emptihad, oil money. That’s all you have. Getting a win like that today is embarrassing
9057 2018-12-02 20:03:53 Sweet orange is the best smell in the entire world, I really just like it because of the smell but I've heard it's good to balance your mood. And lavender oil helped my overplucked eyebrows grow back in.
9058 2018-12-02 20:03:38 does cbd oil cure a hurting heart?
9059 2018-12-02 20:03:37 Found out Priyanka exfoliates with coconut oil... i never opened my coconut oil so quick before
9060 2018-12-02 20:03:31 Allah yayi mass rahma
9061 2018-12-02 20:03:24 I need some beard oil
9062 2018-12-02 20:03:02 Bless you! My local plug has disappeared off the face of the earth, his girlfriend too - I can only assume the worst 
& my oil guy is in hospital, so it’s a waiting game.  
I’m climbing the walls tho 
9063 2018-12-02 20:03:02 Aztec Healing Clay + Tea Tree Oil + Witch Hazel
9064 2018-12-02 20:02:59 Once again, how can you say that's just "local" when it's leaking into the OCEAN. Like a "local oil spill" is still going to have global effects.
9065 2018-12-02 20:02:52 every time you use a car, public transportation, any form of electronics and technology, depend on shipping you help keep the money flowing to the oil companies and incentivize politicians to protect the modern comforts and conveniences you seek and enjoy.  #ThankToYouItWorks
9066 2018-12-02 20:02:35 Do we have an updated estimate of Russia oil reserve ?
9067 2018-12-02 20:02:25 “Once you accept the fact that there’s nothing to fear, you drill into the primal oil well. I believe when we do things without fear, we can do anything. As long as you don’t worry about the consequences…”

9068 2018-12-02 20:02:23 Synthenoil. It's oil pumped subcutaneously to make the insecure to feel "big"
9069 2018-12-02 20:02:12 Oil aí eu já não sei...
9070 2018-12-02 20:01:59 true, true.  I'm hoping it will make good fried chicken.  I *love* fried chicken but it can be so messy... and not the prep, but from the oil splattering, etc and I tend to avoid it. (I'm a messy cook anyway)
9071 2018-12-02 20:01:56 Canola oil, for cooking
9072 2018-12-02 20:01:47 Every Evening I care my eyelashes with olive oil. Idk why I did it again  when I need to cry. It hurts so much to be replaced. Every Night I stayed awake just to help him although I was tired af is worthless now. Everything I did is worthless now.
9073 2018-12-02 20:01:46 Ima need this oil change today
9074 2018-12-02 20:01:39 Eucalyptus & peppermint for stress/ anxiety relief. Or grapefruit oil for happiness/ energy 
9075 2018-12-02 20:01:37 Hip pain might be relieved by a castor oil pack.
Google: castor oil pack.

I use the Palma Christi Organic Castor Oil ( I get it from Vitacost)
9076 2018-12-02 20:01:35 Try CBD oil and marijuana tea works wonders for me for my stage 4 endometriosis along with other health issues 
9077 2018-12-02 20:01:11 Me when I oil the baby?
9078 2018-12-02 20:01:10 okay smart guy, if the oil is for the waffles, tell me what that conditioner in the shower is for!
9079 2018-12-02 20:01:00 You can’t say anything bad about the Liberals or NDP they are just such good folks. That is reason we have this fallout now, because of our high hydro prices and oil and transportation cost. Some of our larger manufacturing plants are making their own hydro, go figure.
9080 2018-12-02 20:00:59 It’s the pollution and overused oil that generates the delightful taste 
9081 2018-12-02 20:00:58 Obviously Anna knows nothing about the oil patch. Random drug testing on job sites. I know a few women who work on rigs, in oilsands plants and have not had a problem. As for the article about 150 men on a rig, most rigs I've been on have 3 shifts of 6 men. One shift always off
9082 2018-12-02 20:00:50 لا اقصد لازم تجرب الرز واللبن بجيبه لك مخصوص
9083 2018-12-02 20:00:50 Man I can't wait for GTA 6 where you'll have to put gas in and get oil changes to keep your car running. True immersion.
9084 2018-12-02 20:00:45 Shut the taps off, the US is driving the price down so they can steal our oil!
9085 2018-12-02 20:00:34 Rosemary oil. Helps hair growth, helps headaches, and delightful perfume.
Also, all the witchcraft.

9096 2018-12-02 19:59:10 If th US slashed its war expenditures (milit. budget) by at least 50% at least for a decade & reinvested that money into new technology, education & infrastructure it would already have caught up w countries like Sweden in terms of independence on oil & living standards 4 pour
9097 2018-12-02 19:59:10 Not to worry - Trudeau has more than enough money to go around for every conceivable type of foreign aid (not so much for oil/gas and GM workers). And when he runs out, he’ll just print more.
9098 2018-12-02 19:59:08 Boycott this garbage company and their garbage mindset. They are Hippocrates, Thieves and Liars! They prefer oil from Saudi Arabia. How does that taste? Never buy again! #boycottlush

Are Russia and the Saudis over producing oil to glut the market to crush US fracking?
9105 2018-12-02 19:58:30 Idk where to get a oil change on a Sunday but I need one
9106 2018-12-02 19:58:25 I really hope this castor oil works as well as people say it does
9107 2018-12-02 19:58:19 I added some chopped BBQ chicken and a dash of sesame oil.
9108 2018-12-02 19:58:17 In my most dramatic culinary adventure to date, I have just set fire to some oil heating in the oven for a Yorkshire pudding. It was quite pretty but a little more exciting than I would generally recommend for a quiet evening in.
9109 2018-12-02 19:58:01 when my anxiety is high,, i put lavender essential oil or lotion on my chest and wrists to help me fall asleep. i put my hands to my chest when sleeping so i smell it and it calms me down:)
9110 2018-12-02 19:57:47 Plug-in hybrids were a last-gasp band-aid attempt by big oil to hold back the #electriccar The #ageofelectric is upon us. If big oil were smart they’d be investing in electric technologies to hedge against inevitable future lost profits #foresight

9113 2018-12-02 19:57:29 How can you say poisoning the ocean is a local problem. Have you hard about the largest oil spill that's still happening on the Louisiana coast? Is that local too?
9114 2018-12-02 19:57:24 Toasted sesame oil is the best oil. Goes in salad dressing really well
9115 2018-12-02 19:57:19 My father has just been diagnosed with parkinsons. I'm trying to read any material pertaining to cbd oil and treating parkinsons. Any info you have would be truly appreciated. Thank you in advance.

9118 2018-12-02 19:56:39 Obama spent his entire presidency obstructing oil permits, exploration, drilling, and pipelines and bashing fossil fuels. His assertion is asinine.
9119 2018-12-02 19:56:27 Now that we know that @AndarkoOil sponsors the @ColoradoBallet we will no longer be supporting the ballet. Health & wellness is too important to us to patronize businesses associated with oil and gas.
9120 2018-12-02 19:56:20 @MielleOrganics what is the best way to use the Mongongo oil collection? I have the entire line. Just wondering when to use the pomade-to-oil vs the heat protectant spray

9124 2018-12-02 19:56:11 I imagine organic ...since they are eking out oil for a few weeks? Can not wait to try. I might use Kentucky bourbon instead of the vodka. The only other thing I have is tequila and I keep that to barter with the zombies. If they ever come...
9125 2018-12-02 19:55:51 What about road construction, oil and gas,foreign education etc

9132 2018-12-02 19:54:33 The climate change denying politicians are bought and paid for by the oil and coal industries who are threatened by clean energy.  The peoples' voice needs to be strong enough to drown out those huge campaign contributions.

9134 2018-12-02 19:54:20 oily/combo skin still needs a lot of moisture, esp in the winter time when combo may produce some dry skin-like traits. i haven’t mastered the acne part yet, but hyaluronic acid will def help reduce the oil. i use benton sheet masks at night, weekly, to keep the oil down.
9135 2018-12-02 19:54:18 Chick fil a use peanut oil too
9136 2018-12-02 19:54:06 Capsules is one way. Another is to mix it with coconut oil and cocoa powder and add artificial sweetener. Roll into balls and freeze it for about 15 minutes.

That's rich (pun intended) "you didn't do that"

9139 2018-12-02 19:52:55 I take evening primrose oil capsules for a week before I'm due helps with pain and hormones for me anyway
9140 2018-12-02 19:52:37 They are still human beings like you and me. People go into gangs, mobs, cartel, oil industry not because they want to, but because that is all they know that will put food on their table. Giving them high-paid green jobs & education will dissuade them, while improving our planet

9145 2018-12-02 19:52:13 Maxine Waters(@RepMaxineWaters) has previously said she wants the government to take control of American oil businesses and to “socialize” the economy.

9146 2018-12-02 19:52:09 The horror. Let’s ensure we staff our mines and oil derricks the same way @JustinTrudeau built his cabinet - 50% female whether they can do the job or not.
9147 2018-12-02 19:52:04 Just changed the oil in both cars. Glad I’m feeling somewhat productive on this beautiful day while listening to this horrible #Browns⁠ ⁠⁠ ⁠game. Thanks for at least making it entertaining @jimdonovancbs3

9154 2018-12-02 19:51:35 This is such an uneducated theory. Refining oil is approximately 5 times more expensive to produce in Canada than it is in Saudi Arabia, due to geography alone.
9155 2018-12-02 19:51:22 And Saskatchewan is selling their oil at WTC prices ? And that’s because they have a Conservative government. Please correct me if I’m wrong.

9189 2018-12-02 19:48:10 And who exactly in your opinion is pushing for repeal of the #ESA?  It’s more than just Oil and Gas interests.  Ranchers? States who want to regain control of Public lands?  There are definite special interests at work here. Don’t discount hunters.
9190 2018-12-02 19:48:02 This is the most obvious corruption, he will slaughter dolphins and whales so the oil companies can make money. That's exactly what they are doing it is so obviously craven, because it's so clear and simple. America has become the country that commits wholesale murder for money.

9202 2018-12-02 19:46:43 It’s about making a point, dummy. Justin is too spineless to do it, but Canada should stop dealing with KSA entirely. That means oil too, but of course Justin refuses to allow more Canadian oil so he must import Saudi. Embarrassing and hypocritical.
9203 2018-12-02 19:46:43 They manage our so called "president" together, so why not the oil markets.

9207 2018-12-02 19:46:25 The oil drilling is leaving empty pockets underground. The permafrost is melting so fast they are finding frozen people and animals all the time. Plus they remove the salt underground in Canada. The earth shifted on it's axis 30 plus years ago. Global warming is just speeding it
9208 2018-12-02 19:46:23 By frying it with oil??????????
9209 2018-12-02 19:46:21 Even the Canadian province of Québec decides it OWN immigration policy, and Alberta runs its OWN oil industry.

9228 2018-12-02 19:44:25 It's people like you who have been a part of the problem why Western countries haven't tackled the human impact on climate change in the previous decades already. There are many affordable alternatives to oil & gas, so you're argument isn't based on proven facts. @TMZ

The thing I use most is a salicylic acid face wash, it removes dead skin and makes my skin look fresh.

9247 2018-12-02 19:42:28 The oil coming out of the ground is leaving empty space underground that is probably collapsing. Arizona is experiencing the same thing caused by removing water from underground. The oil drilling must cease @SarahPalinUSA @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr
9248 2018-12-02 19:42:15 Supporting palm oil is not the way. The RSPO is industry self-regulation & greenwashing. Industry self regulation never works. Perhaps those who supposedly work to conserve rainforests of SE Asia should not be accepting of this process lacking transparency & accountability.
9249 2018-12-02 19:42:14 Actually the people trying to shutdown the oil industry in AB are saying that. They don't care about drug use, people losing their jobs, economies being destroyed, etc. They're totally immoral. They're not your friends so don't let them use you.
9250 2018-12-02 19:42:05 Also, unlike ETH there isn't an unlimited supply of oil
9251 2018-12-02 19:42:00 Where the f*ck is @kenthehr in this Alberta oil crisis? He represents the Calgary core for Christ sake and he’s been completely silent while Alberta suffers. How did anybody elect this moron?
9252 2018-12-02 19:41:17 But you can love something and it know it isn’t good.  I loved my 96 Ford Escort that had absolutely no reason to still be running after 35,000 miles without an oil change; but I knew it was a piece of shit
9253 2018-12-02 19:41:10 And the oil and gas industry gets fined where as wind just gets free chicken dinners
9254 2018-12-02 19:41:10 On the other hand, cheap dirty coal and oil carry ZERO political risks?
9255 2018-12-02 19:41:05 So hot. 
I will add this to my Jack off material. After all that is why you post these.
9256 2018-12-02 19:41:05 Atleast he did my oil change for the low  but naaaaaaaa im good sir.
9257 2018-12-02 19:40:36 I came to get an oil change not get hit on 
9258 2018-12-02 19:40:35 You know if Jackie can sheathe and unsheathe his claws does that mean when he paints them he just keeps them unsheathed until the paint is dry and then puts a protective layer of oil on it so he dont get fucked up.
9259 2018-12-02 19:40:32 True. Overpopulation, greed, neglect, selfishness on everyone’s. Everyone contributes to it knowingly or unknowingly. Many of cars we drive pollute, the food/ products we consume contains palm oil and on and on .
9260 2018-12-02 19:40:28 Seems that it would be better to suspend Saudi oil imports and send our own down east and cut or delay arms sales
9261 2018-12-02 19:40:27 でもウルフってちょっとカッコいいよなーあっいや一番カッコいいのはハンターだけどな！
9262 2018-12-02 19:40:26 And sadly she didn’t, she focused instead on her socialist ideology. So here we are today, heavily discounted oil and a major loss of investors.
9263 2018-12-02 19:40:24 Lol were ni e  how can you say that?

9265 2018-12-02 19:40:12 I really need to replace my bike engine if not just upgrade to a shiney new one altogether. Im keeping it going with an aggressive regime of TLC and more oil than a bike should use in it's lifetime.

methinks your lady doth protest too much. Her ability to get oil to tide water wasn't inextricably tied to Ottawa. Her solutions are the brink of defeat. Let someone snatch victory from her jaws. You'll prosper with someone connected to solutions.
9268 2018-12-02 19:39:58 Btw. I have jacked off to your naked homoerotic pics so mamy times

So thank you 
9269 2018-12-02 19:39:56 Second, when you look at the global power structure, am I supposed to believe that the powerful schemers are professors trying to warn us and these pathetic activists and the poor oppressed people are oil company executives and oil rich dictators
9270 2018-12-02 19:39:52 How does one find time to study, go to the gym, go get an oil change, go to dinner, and lay in bed all day? Asking for a friend
9271 2018-12-02 19:39:51 Getting your oil changed is stressful and I havent even driven into the building yet
9272 2018-12-02 19:39:33 We must be,

9274 2018-12-02 19:39:32 YES!  HE HAS NOW TAKEN CREDIT FOR ALL THE NEW JOBS, THE ECONOMY, MANUFACTURING INCREASING AND MOST LATELY THE OIL PRODUCTION INCREASE.
DELUSIONAL IS RIGHT.. HE DID NOTHING TO IMPROVE IN ANY OF THOSE AREAS...he is looooney Toons!
9275 2018-12-02 19:39:26 What kind of Oil Can Harry $#!+ was this fool on. 
9276 2018-12-02 19:39:22 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
9277 2018-12-02 19:39:17 His admin issue the lowest number of new oil permits than any admin in history! Typical liberal Dem, take all the credit when things go good! Then they deny & blame the @GOP when DEM policy's create desastorist results, which is usually the outcome of DEM policy! DBL STANDARD!
9278 2018-12-02 19:39:16 Oh I thought you meant "DrJohn cod liver oil." 
9279 2018-12-02 19:39:13 someone said put drops of eucalyptus oil in bong water for it to soothe ur throat honestly just go hard or go home (imma still write that down tho)
9280 2018-12-02 19:39:08 That's the example I try to show by having lost a lot of weight & eating only NonGMO/Organic thus eliminating all meds but insulin & Synthroid. I use wild salmon oil, sublingual B12/6, & selenium for nerves pain, inflammation,  brain & heart health plus cancer prevention.
9281 2018-12-02 19:39:07 Has anyone made the Bittman latkes? Why don’t I trust him? I think it’s the “neutral oil” that gives me doubts...
9282 2018-12-02 19:39:06 The way Rupees Going down,i am hopefull soon it will search oil in depth
9283 2018-12-02 19:39:04 Canola is usually GMO to resist Round Up. If that were not enough, they use hexane to extract the oil. Hexane is nasty stuff. We use it to test permanence of ink on labels.
9284 2018-12-02 19:39:01 oil heating is ridiculously expensive. Our house is old and the coal fire only heats the living room and a wee electric heater for the wee ones bedroom. last time I got oil was £155 and lasted 2 weeks brrr
9285 2018-12-02 19:39:00 Executive Producer of We, maybe you can help me produce one...
9286 2018-12-02 19:38:59 Good luck today to all the electric cars travelling our streets saving the Environment.. hopefully you have enough power to get home or enough power to drift into a charging station. A Pipeline would have reduced emissions more than the trains and big trucks moving Oil today
9287 2018-12-02 19:38:53 This deal is a farce - nothing more than a stale mate ...then we will have to renegotiate to leave. Every EU will want something to allow us to leave - be it fishing regions, oil areas, specific trade tariffs, Land etc. #BrexitChaos. Good deal, No Deal or remain! #PeoplesVote
9288 2018-12-02 19:38:51 Everyone left me in the house alone and I can’t even find my oil my life is a joke
9289 2018-12-02 19:38:50 I watched panorama the other night El about cannabis being legalised in the UK it was really interesting. The non legal stuff is way better because it works within an hour. The CBD oil is really no good. I feel no effect from the pain at all. X
9290 2018-12-02 19:38:44 Have you tried CBD oil? Seems to be good for most things. @cbdbrothers are the most frequently recommended supplier and they have a range of products.
9291 2018-12-02 19:38:20 Pele ee...  Mouth piece, why not let the millions come speak for themselves...
9292 2018-12-02 19:38:14 Oil is literally made on land we had to steal from dinosaurs. True story.
9293 2018-12-02 19:37:49 “For eating and for health, use extra virgin olive oil.” @amyriolo @MetroCookingDC @PizzaUniv
9294 2018-12-02 19:37:21 7000 more chances of a major disaster! Who will benefit from the rail car and locomotive manufacturing? Certainly NOT Western Canada! Maybe Venezuela, China or some other #AntiOilsands #AntiPipeline interest! I say the big money is with the offshore oil investors double dipping!
9295 2018-12-02 19:37:19 I knew quite a few people that were driving luxury cars during undergrad but were piss poor with the upkeep. Putting regular gas in their car and getting oil changes once a year 
9296 2018-12-02 19:37:19 Errybody should fuck pat at least once, just to be sure. 
Am I lesbian?
Am I Gay?
Do I like black dudes?
Do I like the taste of Baby Oil?
Should sex feel like a slip'n'slide

Figure out all this and more, by fucking Your Boy Pat. The Homie we need, and Deserve!
9297 2018-12-02 19:37:03 I woke up 3x times this morning and I planned on getting my carrot Oil cause honey the bottle I searched high & low & spent a grip on is in CT & coconut Oil ain't it for my skin, but these cramps got me 
9298 2018-12-02 19:36:59 Put akagi in dorm for a few days while you level up Yorktown & Ayanami at 6-1 first. Then bring akagi & ajax to 3-4 for kaga. In a week you will be ready with low oil fleet (24~ oil) on 6-4
9299 2018-12-02 19:36:51 Right. I try to steer people away from store bought and cheap oil. I go they doterra but I bet young living is just as good

9302 2018-12-02 19:36:36 They all fucked us over but in different ways.
Trump: Treason, attempt to subvert the Constitution, and, of course, $$.
Bushes: Quayle & Cheney,
greed for oil, fake WMDs.
9303 2018-12-02 19:36:33 Had an 1:00 pm appointment for an oil change at @tirekingdom, but when I got there they told me it's a 2 hour wait. No thanks. I'll go to the drive through oil change when it opens tomorrow #VictoryLube
9304 2018-12-02 19:36:33 We know, Fuel Tax escalator from refined Scottish oil at the fuel pumps brings £28bn+ to the exchequer. Neither that nor 20% VAT on all sales are in GERS? We do not count cash from North Sea licences nor exports of Oil or Gas. Treasury appears to count just 20% of Scotch Whisky?
9305 2018-12-02 19:36:29 Lack of baby oil 
9306 2018-12-02 19:36:24 Interesting that you take no issue with the mismanagement of our oil revenues from the PCs for decades. Had they taken care of our money wisely, instead if blowing it on $400 cheques for everyone etc. the NDP would not have found AB in such a dreadful financial state.
9307 2018-12-02 19:36:23 "Trumpettes"? An oil painting of Trump as a Young Man in a Tennis Sweater Over a Button-down Shirt, With an Ascot, in that garish frame?

Oh the humanity.
9308 2018-12-02 19:36:22  cod liver oil. Have you heard of that. Tim.
9309 2018-12-02 19:36:20 #OIL #OOTT #WTI
According to the premarket quotes, #Euro is trading at 1.13608 currently. It's a 47-pips jump from Friday close. By the same token, WTI shall gap up tonight.
9310 2018-12-02 19:36:14 Snake oil salesmen, be on your way, never thought I’d see the day when I stuck up two fingers to the Tories, lost my vote forever.
9311 2018-12-02 19:36:13 Do you know how much bacteria is on a beard? Men do not keep those things clean. Just think, every time they eat, drink, and sweat...hair absorbs liquid and oil and that turns into mold. I just can’t!
9312 2018-12-02 19:36:06 Should Alberta curtail oil production in order to combat low crude prices? #yeg #yyc #ableg #CDNPOLI
9313 2018-12-02 19:36:06 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
9314 2018-12-02 19:36:02 On set and my hair is dry. I go in the production van and find oil from subway that wasn’t used. God always makes a way!
9315 2018-12-02 19:35:52 No...  Na in shirts...
9316 2018-12-02 19:35:34 CN oil train just went north bound
9317 2018-12-02 19:35:28 Jewish Festival of #Hanukkah tonight.

It commemorates a biblical story when a miracle made some lighting oil last not one but 8 days in the wreckage of their destroyed Temple.

Bringing light out of darkness in midst of a catastrophe feels like a topical and hopeful message.
9318 2018-12-02 19:35:19 Baby oil
9319 2018-12-02 19:35:09 24% palm in SE (which accounts for 34% global deforestation ) Asia (used in many products vegan, non-vegan, animal feed and beauty products) , 20% of deforestation in the Amazon is soy. 70% of soy goes to animal feed, 24% oil 6% food (both vegan and non-vegan)
9320 2018-12-02 19:35:03 George Bush Senior was a liar he looked straight into the TV and said no new taxes I will not raise your taxes what he do bush raised our taxes while the oil companies were lining his pockets with money. George Bush Junior put us in a war after he lied to us
9321 2018-12-02 19:35:01 I smell the engine oil of Jude
9322 2018-12-02 19:34:48 No for killing people for oil..
9323 2018-12-02 19:34:47 Yeah, but the same could be said about converting these farms to soy and palm oil crops. That's what the issue is. The produce we're throwing away as well is having a large impact as well. Why are you ignoring that? I am acknowledging that the world has a meat problem.
9324 2018-12-02 19:34:40 Really tasty. Highly recommend the chickpea pancakes. I don’t think we’ll ever buy wraps again! Equal parts chickpea flour & water, tiny drizzle of oil, salt & pepper. Non stick pan & done in a minute or two 
(Can also add any herbs/spices you like. Really good)
9325 2018-12-02 19:34:37 use oil and grow your hair and then we will go bald together Caz we stan legends
9326 2018-12-02 19:34:37 creative #intelligence might be the oil in the gearbox of the culture history. but emotions were and still are the engine! #SundayThoughts 
think about it, frustration, hunger, safety, to increase the own circumstances, all this emotions lead to religion, technology, science etc
9327 2018-12-02 19:34:29 Secretary Zinke’s Interior Department is a force for good" for Big Oil, real estate developers, and others using public land management to line their pockets. These are Republican thieves, make no mistake.
9328 2018-12-02 19:34:27 And Barry Soper also provides no details, no polling period, and no polling history. 
And the numbers he quotes are nothing like what Lusk was suggesting last week at Whale Oil. 
Who do you believe?

9333 2018-12-02 19:34:01 I like how even CNN propped up a war criminal and thief of american military might and economy control over oil, as a saint- when he was marked for arrest by several states, and could not leave the country as he was wanted for war crimes #GeorgeWBush #HypocriteHeroes
9334 2018-12-02 19:33:43 FUCK A MECHANIC I FIXED MY OWN CARS AC. Still don’t know how to change my own oil tho
9335 2018-12-02 19:33:38 นี่กูตื่นมาทำอะไรแบบนี้เพื่อ
9336 2018-12-02 19:33:32 @RachelNotley Beware of mandating oil cuts....Nafta could get ugly....instead put in mimimum royalty payments...suggest WTI -10-20%. that will make certain properties cash flow negative...industry can then decide which properties to shut in.  
Keep mandated cuts for later
9337 2018-12-02 19:33:17 Going to order a moderately sized curry because I’m worried about the impact of all that oil on my arteries!! Why am I like this 
9338 2018-12-02 19:33:13 Fossil fuel powered hybrid cars are being advertised in Ireland as 'self-charging' cars. This sleight-of-language attempts to slow our transition from oil, and in many cases the electric engine is almost never in use in 'normal' driving conditions.
9339 2018-12-02 19:33:12 I love how "moral courage" in your mind is willingness to bomb people for no reason beyond the ability for american companies to make money off oil somewhere (Certainly nothing to do with the american people).
9340 2018-12-02 19:33:09 Wednesday is a sky pirate and Billy is a florist :D and my pudu, Briar is a snake oil salesman
9341 2018-12-02 19:33:04 He gets $$$$$$$ from oil and coal companies. That is ALL he cares about
9342 2018-12-02 19:33:03 (hint-lobbyists, legalized bribary aka Citizens United)

We've saved Millions upon Millions and just scratched the surface!

But I suppose you'd prefer we keep giving $60Million a yr in subsidies to Big Oil companies clearing Billions in profits instead
aka welfare for the rich??
9343 2018-12-02 19:32:40 Had a12noon appt for an oil change
It’s 2:32 and my car is only now being checked out .....wtf was the point of having an appointment 
9344 2018-12-02 19:32:32 “But Venezuela” isn’t the big gotcha right wing losers think it is. Maduro isn’t even there, for one, and Evo Morales is socialist and Bolivia is one of the fastest growing economies, it just happens not to have oil and be subject to economic warfare
9345 2018-12-02 19:32:31 @SaudiRoyalFam Okay Enough.  Over a Billion Muslims allow you to hold two Holy Sites in a Sacred Trust and then your son had a journalist butchered up slowly alive.  You also are hoarding most of the wealth as the Oil dries up.  You are not descended from Muhammad. Resign.
9346 2018-12-02 19:32:28 The poor mans drink
9347 2018-12-02 19:32:27 Dear @jidesanwoolu how do you intend to integrate us ( the Hausa community) born and bred in Lagos into your government, as we have contributed immensely to the progress and development of the state. Yours should be an all inclusive government
#ForAGreaterLagos
9348 2018-12-02 19:32:25 That guy (not my guy) is looking to shutdown your province after running oil sands into the ground.  Pretty much a stated goal. After all why shd we pay 25 cents a litre!
9349 2018-12-02 19:32:23 Parce qu’elle n’est pas appliquée de façon généralisée. Sinon pourquoi?
9350 2018-12-02 19:32:16 I'd love to burst your bubble: the #GreenNewDeal alone will be enough to kneecap your Rising Star™, Beto Oil'Rourke. Kamala Harris has already nullified her anti-trump potential with her Mnuchin protection. #MeToo has already made Biden an electorally dead man walking. EAT SHIT.
9351 2018-12-02 19:32:09 God I love oil
9352 2018-12-02 19:31:45 As do a most vegans. Palm oil is a problem for all of to tackle and is in most processed foods vegan or not. The only thing that makes it a vegan issue is that vegans care about how what they do may have impact on animals and planet while most meat eaters don’t.
9353 2018-12-02 19:31:42 So i heard you have to be Spiritually fortified either 'Heavenly or Awon Iya Aye' to be able to Fry "Akara" with red oil. Abeg shey na true? RT #AkaraElepo
9354 2018-12-02 19:31:37 It’s interesting how the smell of grey flannel instantly takes me back to my father - even though he’s passed on. I can feel what it was like to hug him. Instantly in his arms. I’m usually an essential oil gal but the scent of the men’s bleu by chanel is actually quite nice.
9355 2018-12-02 19:31:31 Sorry, trump will never get it.  His eyes are only on the cash.  Oil rigs are invisible.
9356 2018-12-02 19:31:26 Called phoney @JeffFlake and raised. 
No big deal, 30 days and crank it back up.
9357 2018-12-02 19:31:14 Run the voltage from your tractor. Means an oil reserve tank and hydraulic motor set-up mounted underneath the trailer. Just needs an inline switch or remote control
9358 2018-12-02 19:31:12 -3-4 workouts with compound exercises per week
-3000 cals+ per day
-B vitamin complex
-Fish oil

-Whey
-Only fap once per week

And check results in 6 months
9359 2018-12-02 19:31:11 You go first
9360 2018-12-02 19:31:09 Exactly, this is what Macron is asking... and they are saying no.  Remember France has only just recently come out of a State of Emergency for over 2 yrs since the Paris Attacks.  A State of Emergency just at this stage gives the Government easier access to methods of control.
9361 2018-12-02 19:31:09 Thinking of you!! Eilidh just put me in charge of oil and seasoning hahahahahha
9362 2018-12-02 19:31:08 1. I don’t like that idea 2. Is this your argument for using their oil?
9363 2018-12-02 19:31:02 Effectivement, le terme n'est pas bon, mais il y a eu une baisse des cotisations obligatoire (sans baisse des droits associés) qui s'apparente pour les actifs à une baisse des prélèvements. Cette baisse est supérieure à la hausse de la csg et il faut donc la financer...
9364 2018-12-02 19:30:49 You are just as big of a danger to children than this snake oil salesman please don't have children
9365 2018-12-02 19:30:48 FCH Christmas Fair this Friday 7th December. Friday is a non-uniform day, we just ask each child to bring in a bottle for the bottle stall, a bottle of cordial, ketchup, shampoo, wine (make sure an adult hands it in), olive oil etc. Thank you. 
9366 2018-12-02 19:30:45 Food companies never try to invent a hamburger that tastes like broccoli, or milk that tastes like vegetable oil. But they do try to make vegetarian dishes resemble meat dishes. One is natural; the other is imitation.
9367 2018-12-02 19:30:44 WE in caps
9368 2018-12-02 19:30:42 It is heartbreaking. Sometimes ignorance is bliss, but now I know I can’t eat it. Hope they make one without Palm Oil soon :(
9369 2018-12-02 19:30:39 But ‘sustainable palm oil’ DID cause deforestation, clear peatlands & endanger rare, threatened or endangered wildlife. Due to palm oil’s carbon emissions, it must be replaced by high carbon sink tropical rainforest & we must stop using palm oil. @MikeySlezak @PaulEDawson
9370 2018-12-02 19:30:38 *OMAN OIL MIN SAYS THERE IS CONSENSUS FOR AN OIL PRODUCTION CUT; SAYS OMAN READY TO JOIN: BBG. #OOTT
9371 2018-12-02 19:30:34 So no olive oil? Not sure how I could live without it 
9372 2018-12-02 19:30:33 I just asked if CBD oil was the same thing as WD-40

9380 2018-12-02 19:29:55 @ImpossibleFoods So I had one of your #ImpossibleBurgers today.  It was good.  I am concerned though because they contain palm oil and palm oil is responsible for deforestation of rainforests.  I wonder if there would not be a better alternative oil.  Thx.

9382 2018-12-02 19:29:49 I like the solar idea I like partly electric idea and I still like oil idea so although it seems difficult I think not long term goals.
9383 2018-12-02 19:29:47 Glad you did, that's when I first met you. I felt like a spare part in a well oil machine but you were just so friendly. Bloody cold day though!
9384 2018-12-02 19:29:32 Totally ignoring the results of the hurricane that washed oil rigs out of the Atlantic, and into New Orleans waters.  Doing it at a time when storms are becoming more frequent and violent.  Doing it so the wealthy can shit up our coasts & become more wealthy.

9387 2018-12-02 19:28:53 @MichaelSerapio I had to chuckle at your guest Reubin (sp) today, saying oil production will step up in 3 to 6 months after the "seasonal" maintenance is over. May we assume the oil refineries will be open in May 2019 and then shut down again in the fall for another six months?
9388 2018-12-02 19:28:52 Most greenhouse gases come from  burning fossil fuels like oil, coal, and natural gas,(autos, electricity, heat) but they also come from using fertilizers, raising livestock, and maintaining landfills. Which of these will you give up?
9389 2018-12-02 19:28:49 this one called “calm” and i use it for anxiety sometimes because it actually calms me down some. also hopefully i’m getting this oil vape called ocean breeze to help with anxiety. not to be dependent on though
9390 2018-12-02 19:28:45 I'm sure Jessi has an oil for you. :)
9391 2018-12-02 19:28:29 Let's talk about the successful solar & wind energy initiative. They are in the same state now as the coal industry during his presidency. All gone! Companies bankrupt CEO'S richer and tax payer funding wasted. The only thing Obama knows about Oil came from Beverly Hillbillies
9392 2018-12-02 19:28:15 I've issues using oils cuz of allergies. Lavender & lilac, smells soothing. Rosehip is supposed to also help with cramps, etc. Olive oil (evoo), I'm told, is a great moisturizer for your skin and hair. Particularly if you have sensitive skin. Cinnamon to smell when I need energy.
9393 2018-12-02 19:28:10 How many more clues do we need? He had him killed and nothing is being done about it. They will lower gas prices and all will be washed away with blood oil.

9413 2018-12-02 19:26:08 Did Putin install Tillerson as SoS in hopes of lifting the sanctions to close the deal with Exxon on the Arctic Sea oil drilling? Tillerson hollowed our the State Department & tRump never even knew him beforehand. We never hear about this anymore....

9415 2018-12-02 19:26:06 Ameen
9416 2018-12-02 19:25:56 Context: Oil and gas companies pay the highest effective tax rate in US, Canada, and UK.
9417 2018-12-02 19:25:56 Which is why we must all demand sustainable palm oil which does not cause deforestation, clear peatlands or endanger rare, threatened or Endangered wildlife.
9418 2018-12-02 19:25:52 Im going to be blessed 
9419 2018-12-02 19:25:51 Why?  Why does using something that doesn’t belong to you make it yours?  Why does plowing a field you don’t own entitle you to the oil underneath?

9421 2018-12-02 19:25:49 Coal is black, so is soot. Oil too. Matter of fact, pure carbon is black. We need a form of power that is the opposite of that to get where we need to be.

9447 2018-12-02 19:23:20 As I understand it  Peskov is not "the real estate guy". I seem to remember he has something to do with oil and other heavy industries.
9448 2018-12-02 19:23:01 Goes way deeper than just this carbon tax.  The tax BTW was betwen 21 - 35% increases.  HUGE!  Heating Oil at the start of winter went with a 30% tax... crippling.  But these protests are now starting to show the real discontent that has existed for years.
9449 2018-12-02 19:22:54 There's a LOT of protests going on, against oil prices being too high, against the way the government is treating us... Etc... It's getting violent in some places

9452 2018-12-02 19:22:42 Looks balanced. Oil looks good in terms of stats that are selective. Ray parlours assist stats would look dire compared to ozils but I'd take parlour in any arsenal starting xi over ozil all day long. Why? Because of all the other intangibles - effort, fight, attitude.
9453 2018-12-02 19:22:23 What I'm saying is, sharpen your guillotine blades. It's about time we got French on these oil barons! Lol, jk! Also, I need to proofread my tweets better. Some of these mistakes are just embarrassing
9454 2018-12-02 19:22:20 I still haven’t found a sour I can drink with a straight face! I’ve gone way too far down the path of absurdly sickly sweet motor oil to be redeemed I think.
9455 2018-12-02 19:22:16 I’ve only worked for larger oil companies in the oil sands, and this would absolutely not happen there. It would result in immediate firing and lifetime ban from site!
9456 2018-12-02 19:22:15 Quite frankly I’m appalled that many conservation orgs are in support of this & therefore blatantly supporting palm oil now. @MikeySlezak @StephenLongAus @PeterEgan6 @p_hannam
9457 2018-12-02 19:22:04 Hi think we agree on most things however our current government is using the carbon tax for renewables, with Kenney it will disappear. Over time with oil revenue we can get off oil, without we will be a have not.

9461 2018-12-02 19:21:57 How about surging oil prices instead?

9463 2018-12-02 19:21:43 Terrorism will never "die" and we will never get off oil unless we all unite and face our addiction. End these endless wars, the Green new deal will create jobs and end our dependence on oil.

Is it possible it’s secretly a mission to discover natural resources? Gas, oil, water? 
They can safely drill for gas without danger of fracking side effects. 
It might also tell us THEY believe we are running out, but can’t admit it.

9517 2018-12-02 19:17:17 I see no evidence in mainland US that solar plus adequate battery storage is anywhere close to competitive. All the level costs I have seen do not put them together in adequate volumes.

This is why New England burns diesel oil for grid power during any cold winter day now. 1/2
9518 2018-12-02 19:17:12 @weopine There indeed may be smoke where there is fire with Trump and Russia - trump may be trying to stop a nuclear strike or general war with Russia over natural gas and oil. Trying to ease tensions - but the West's true rulers want that war. THEY ARE GOING TO GET THAT WAR.
9519 2018-12-02 19:17:06 Google? Google has become pro  socialism... they have removed a lot of stuff... go to a  Library. Like I said I’m well educated on WWII PRE AND POST war.  Look at the south American oil countries, They are  socialist ran by  fascist dictator‘s Nazi Germany was a  socialist state

9521 2018-12-02 19:16:34 Yup Jerry Dias I suppose is doing his job, being a huge Union leach, he hates anyone and anything that isn’t Union, like of coarse he hates oil patch and pipelines, he thinks the auto industry is the largest working sector, Prairie oil is 10 fold that of Auto, but no Unions
9522 2018-12-02 19:16:30 He has hair oil a cigarette and a studded leather jacket... Punk Greaser... Riiiight...
9523 2018-12-02 19:16:29 Prescott Bush was selling oil to the Nazi's.
9524 2018-12-02 19:16:16 No....It's oil money who wins
9525 2018-12-02 19:16:14 Article absolument remarquable ! Merci
9526 2018-12-02 19:16:09 We should focus on capping underwater wells that are spilling, before we start bombing the oceans. The Taylor Energy well in the gulf has been spewing oil almost 15 years now.
9527 2018-12-02 19:15:55 Rosemary oil for like everything
Its great for hair growth, relaxation, aids memory and studying and helps boost the immune system

9529 2018-12-02 19:15:44 I know, I thought I lost him for a moment until he smiled
9530 2018-12-02 19:15:34 Two bites at the cherry higher risk wick  offset with oil discovery that flowed Colter. Great risk reward #boil
9531 2018-12-02 19:15:29 Without the government, who's gonna tax us to subside the oil companies?
9532 2018-12-02 19:15:26 They don't know who started the fire? Maybe faulty oil
9533 2018-12-02 19:15:25 This bitch on a cooking show really just said “now I’m just gonna pour a healthy layer of oil in my pan”. A healthy layer...really???
9534 2018-12-02 19:15:20 The good old oil change.
9535 2018-12-02 19:15:06 Many people predicted the reverse, but most env eco experts argued about the rate and pace and policies of transition to a post oil society, mainly  to counteract climate change, and not even solely based on continuing  higher costs for petroleum ie peak oil thesis.

9538 2018-12-02 19:14:47 Hey Karan, Is it possible to write a piece explaining the surge of oil prices in the last 10-15 years vis a vis the crude oil prices, moreso, something that gleans into the genesys of the rise in the retail oil prices over the years which includes the UPA & NDA years thus far
9539 2018-12-02 19:14:34 Cut the carbon tax, oil to east & BC and transfer payments that's fighting for Alberta not your weak assed speeches actions speak louder than words @jkenney
9540 2018-12-02 19:14:31 Cinnabar name derives from the Persian word meaning 'Dragons Blood'. Aka Cinnabarite. Dragon's Blood is a resin collected from specific plants being anti- viral, and oil form is used for uncrossing, spiritual cleansing, protection, & empowerment. A spiritual supply. #Hist111

9545 2018-12-02 19:14:07 In conclusion after going back to those hard blocked cheese from the dairy dept at the Food Store I’ve come to the decision that you guys are retarded. 

1. It is way too potent. 
2. It has too much oil.
3. It doesn’t blend\breakdown quickly. 

Now I remember why I stopped.
9546 2018-12-02 19:14:02 Lets tell that to all the people that died in Desert Storm. Including the 10,000+ innocent people that died in the name for oil and money.
9547 2018-12-02 19:13:56 It’s the other way around because the USA is prevailing in trade oil is down, lower than other years.
9548 2018-12-02 19:13:44 Yes care factor is zero. The Roundtable on sustainable palm oil is a blatant attempt at improving the palm oil industry’s image, and that’s about it. All they had to do is call it sustainable & that’s convinced many it seems.
9549 2018-12-02 19:13:32 And credit goes to ur government??? Ma’am there are things called international crude oil prices and cartels like OPEC ! Ohhh whom am I explaining to!
9550 2018-12-02 19:13:26 #OMAN OIL MINISTER: OMAN READY TO CUT OIL OUTPUT WITH OPEC

9551 2018-12-02 19:13:22 "Lexi? Probably asleep in the tent. She wanders a lot. She's hard to keep track of."

He realizes, talking to a father, that this all seems like stupid excuses, but it's true. Keeping track of Lexi was like trying to hold a struggling fish with your hands covered in oil.
9552 2018-12-02 19:13:18 Before my surgery this past January, I had a candid conversation with my surgeon, the attending nurse and anesthesiologist about my medical cannabis use.

I was also given the okay to medicate with oil in the recovery room before I was released.

Talk to your doctors honestly.
9553 2018-12-02 19:13:16 Moruti we want oil... Not media freedom that your boss use discredit black leadership in SA
9554 2018-12-02 19:13:13 You bought a pipeline, are giving oil sands an increase to 100Mt of emissions and refuse to come up with meaningful reduction targets.
9555 2018-12-02 19:13:10 I use a blend of Spanaway, copaiba, and fractional coconut oil to help with my back pain.
9556 2018-12-02 19:12:58 He never did anything but hold back oil production.

9558 2018-12-02 19:12:36 I mean I know people who put straight coconut oil on their face every day & it’s totally fine but just for me, literally the worst breakout ever lol
9559 2018-12-02 19:12:32 Cannabis oil... 
Just for the tough time
9560 2018-12-02 19:12:27 Mate, I cook the humble soup. Indeed it's about taste and a good soup is better than a poor meal. 

That soup looked very good, just add some olive oil and roasted  pine nuts on top to elevate.

You should be happy with that.
9561 2018-12-02 19:12:24 
9562 2018-12-02 19:12:00 I will never think it's normal to stay in my car during an oil change while someone descends into a secret basement to do unmentionable things to my vehicle. #JustMichiganThings
9563 2018-12-02 19:11:59 As soon as I've served you, you've never poured oil on the ground again, and tries to the girl herself came to aunt's to
9564 2018-12-02 19:11:52 I know everything is clearer the next day. But, Milan needs to relax and hit the net. He used to before joining the Oil. He's in his head and trying to play to his contract - just be yourself. Best advice a coach ever gave me, and it applies here I think. Cheers,
9565 2018-12-02 19:11:48 Amazing eh? A natural resource we pay money to companies to take out the ground. If Oil taxation was done properly then.......
9566 2018-12-02 19:11:42 I’ve made the horrible choice of putting cinnamon in the essential oil diffuser today 
9567 2018-12-02 19:11:36 While waiting in line for my oil change, I ordered myself 3 boots, none that I could probably walk more than 30 minutes in
9568 2018-12-02 19:11:33 Good. No more exemptions should be granted to those importing their oil.
9569 2018-12-02 19:11:29 I found evening primrose oil capsules helped mine a lot, also a makeshift wheatie (rice in a spare sock, along paracetamol). Also staying hydrated helps. I like peppermint tea which is good for helping indigestion if you get nausea too
9570 2018-12-02 19:11:27 Hi! So for the face I mostly used Procreate’s basic round and square brushes. I also used a bit of the basic oil brush. For the hair I used a couple different oil brushes from Ilya Tyljakov’s oil brush pack. :)
9571 2018-12-02 19:11:26 . @NatureValleyUK if 'nature has been your inspiration since 1975' as per your packaging how come your products contain palm oil? Not exactly a nature friendly ingredient...  #nopalmoil #nopalmoilchristmas
9572 2018-12-02 19:11:26 Does anyone know if cbd oil comes back on a drug test? #question
9573 2018-12-02 19:11:14 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
9574 2018-12-02 19:11:14 Did you know you can put CBD oil in your bath water and get the same effect? That may help..baths are already relaxing so i can only imagine the addition of CBD oil
9575 2018-12-02 19:11:13 Gas definitely not any oil. There’s no oil anywhere in the us if that was the case we wouldn’t be buying it from the Arabs 
9576 2018-12-02 19:11:07 Happy Hanakkuh, the holiday that proves that Peak Oil is a myth.
9577 2018-12-02 19:11:04 Best essential oil brands???
9578 2018-12-02 19:10:58 I used glue and vegetable oil to give it all that "perfect" sheen. LOL

9581 2018-12-02 19:10:27 The cart wheeling off injured players in this Broncos-Bengals game is gonna need a gas up & oil change at halftime.

9583 2018-12-02 19:10:23 it's the messaging by oil interests to evangelicals who've distrusted science since Darwin, if they weren't already disposed to.  And a bad education system.

9587 2018-12-02 19:09:49 You should be embarrassed. It's because of you and your party we have Food banks. The oil capital of Europe and we have people relying on them to survive !!! Have a good think about it !!!!
9588 2018-12-02 19:09:45 She is a piece of shit! I read a theory on that FB group that you shared that kind of seemed spot on it was having to do with them planning it . & their jobs and how her job role would help dispose the bodies since she could detect leaks in the oil tanks..
9589 2018-12-02 19:09:45 Obama did more to thwart oil production in our county than any other president. The president of Shell oil put the glory seeker in his rightful place. He’s going to go down as one of the worst if not the worst president we’ve ever had. After Jimmy Carter that’s saying something
9590 2018-12-02 19:09:36 Two faced, money wasting, Saudi oil supporting liar.  #jokePM
9591 2018-12-02 19:09:31 A weekly reminder that while we make transportation & energy choices that impact the climate, oil companies spent decades successfully influencing policies/research to restrict those choices. We need to hold them accountable for past - and present - disinformation on climate.
9592 2018-12-02 19:09:26 Way to miss the entire point.  Canadian companies spent trillions on foreign oil instead of Canadian oil thereby allowing trillions to leave our economy and create jobs elsewhere.  Smart like tractor you are.
9593 2018-12-02 19:09:20 Lemon essential oil bc when someone or something smells funky ,... you get my drift , cleanses the nose
9594 2018-12-02 19:09:14 Wreak havoc like 1992 Los Angeles riots with taxes background which is very schizoid because the french welfare State is all about solidarity  taxes like VAT and oil taxes. In the same time, yellow vests wants more public services, more doctors /nurses. Nonsense spoiled childs.
9595 2018-12-02 19:09:02 Two faced, money wasting, Saudi oil supporting liar.  #jokePM
9596 2018-12-02 19:08:58 Don't. They cost thousands to maintain. An oil change is super expensive. And a lot of them need overhauls every so often
9597 2018-12-02 19:08:58 i also use a cbd peppermint oil when it gets really bad, but i only take that when i stay home because the one i have can give quite the body high.
9598 2018-12-02 19:08:53 Believing climate change is a myth is a distinctly American thing. Also, oil companies still lose out with a fuel tax because people buy less fuel.

But it isn't like France isn't already fighting climate change in other ways.
9599 2018-12-02 19:08:44 Oil
9600 2018-12-02 19:08:43 I need to go get wendys car an oil change so i will be in these comming days lol
9601 2018-12-02 19:08:43 He is really the Narcissist in Chief. 
I know he's taking credit for the stock market and oil production. Have you heard if that he is taking credit for the moon landings?
9602 2018-12-02 19:08:32 Allah yayi mishi rahama.
9603 2018-12-02 19:08:23 I like coconat oil. It smels good and it is really good for skin hair and nails. It makes your skin less dry and strong fingernails. I am really obsessed with coconat oil
9604 2018-12-02 19:08:20 What good is a carbon tax, if oil prices plunge?  What we need is governments moving to a green economy. In Canada, this is happening way too slow.
9605 2018-12-02 19:08:18 There was also a video on tv where Obama said he was concerned about things like a nuke going off in Manhattan - we've reason to believe this came out because there is real intelligence behind that threat. The natural gas and oil wars have Russia furious & the EU- her customer!
9606 2018-12-02 19:08:18 Your mcm got his essential oil shot for this year’s flu season.
9607 2018-12-02 19:08:15 Mine at the time was an 03 , I could get heat at -40 but not much at idle. It didn’t shut off for the winter only for oil changes. Not much was moving at -55 I was hauling Herman Nelson’s to rigs to keep their tanks warm and tank covers n block heaters for their propane tanks.
9608 2018-12-02 19:08:05 Whilst marketing is a useful and necessary skill in business, most people who claim to be marketing experts are snake oil salesmen who charge you a fortune for what a couple books can get you in their "courses".
9609 2018-12-02 19:08:00 canola oil, to cook me some breakfast
9610 2018-12-02 19:07:43 Are you using oil or edibles ?
9611 2018-12-02 19:07:38 Lol instead of oil I add butter...now I feel like eating pancakes 
9612 2018-12-02 19:07:37 I remember a customer, during the 80's oil slump. He worked for a large oil company downtown. He told us he literally hide under his desk to avoid getting the axe. It worked for a few weeks.
9613 2018-12-02 19:07:31 Imran Khan
Cont'd. Ex. President of Iran Ahmad Nayyad used to live in a flat although Iran
is an oil producing country while Pakistan does produce purified drinking water.
He had 3,000 dollars to his credit in bank only. He was sincere to his country.
9614 2018-12-02 19:06:54 Focus on sleep - do anything you can to improve quality. I track w custom factors using Sleep Cycle. 

Microwaveable heat packs (wheat or sand) are super helpful. CBD oil if you can get it. If muscular, diclofenac gel (Voltaren/Voltarol common brand) is excellent
9615 2018-12-02 19:06:53 The funniest part of going through the 2013 era archives of my tumblr blog and mass deleting stuff yesterday was finding a post I had reblogged that said “reblog if you’re a self taught artist!!”

9618 2018-12-02 19:06:43 I shd mention the camps I worked were relatively small. I can see how temporary camps in the thousands just exacerbate issues. But mining, oil & logging camps exist all over the north & west. The behaviour in my experience wasn’t far outside the norm of society, tho hardly ideal.
9619 2018-12-02 19:06:40 I LOVE cooking with sesame oil
9620 2018-12-02 19:06:24 Theatre of the absurd. So they now agree he's the one because he said so? It couldn't we worse of all the oil money is being spent training people in how to be foolish!
9621 2018-12-02 19:06:23 Vegetable oil, and French fries. Key to a happy life 
9622 2018-12-02 19:06:16 There you have it all you haters.  We need oil to run every aspect of our economy and because of a few hypocritical climate change morons our economy is out billions and trillions.  Good work, way to make it impossible to build more schools and hospitals.
9623 2018-12-02 19:06:13 And my dad is taking my car out for an oil change!!
9624 2018-12-02 19:06:03 i got peppermint oil in my eye. i think i’m going blind.

9630 2018-12-02 19:05:39 The cancer clusters are more likely caused by fires of building materials and of mass oil rig fires. There is also a growing consensus that the military burn pits also caused large numbers of cancer clusters.
9631 2018-12-02 19:05:24 Lol if i call you names now you will say i am Bifraud can't you be civil for ones or just bcos i am not supporting your buhari means you should throw insult?
9632 2018-12-02 19:05:21 During the Conservative government’s first 33 months in office, the economy was booming, while their last 33 months included a collapse in oil prices, she noted.
9633 2018-12-02 19:05:12 My ex-bf was there. He said they were told to “protect American Interests Abroad” not Americans.  He was a captain Air Born Ranger. Born mil.  Family all Republicans. After getting shot at for the sake of oil. He disavowed the US & moved to Europe.
9634 2018-12-02 19:05:08 #fakenews this must be a hacked account I swear a GM plant just shut down, oil industry is in shambles, Vets need $$, and lack of clean water on First Nations Reserves - please tell me this is fake news...

9636 2018-12-02 19:05:01 Those holes in Crocs are for your dignity to leave
9637 2018-12-02 19:04:56 If you tax people just buying gas to get to and from work, rather than the companies who've spend mountains of cash to spread the idea that climate change is a myth, it implies that they're more at fault than people spread lies and selling the oil to people without another option
9638 2018-12-02 19:04:43 Explain how that makes any sense ??? Do u know that global oil consumption is going up every year lol ??????????
9639 2018-12-02 19:04:43 Haha give badaam oil a try. Apply on the dark circles at night

9644 2018-12-02 19:04:21 Go to the mall on my lunch or get a oil change?
9645 2018-12-02 19:04:19 Poorly? We have the world's best economy, and military. We are close to if not the leading oil supplier. We rank in the top 10 in most categories throughout the world, and we don't need small, racially segregated cultures to do so because we are also the most diverse. We're fine.
9646 2018-12-02 19:04:05 I'm sure he promised that Canada will buy more OIL, meanwhile Alberta loses $5Billion per MONTH in revenue. Too bad OIL wasn't like @Bombardier or the BANKS.
9647 2018-12-02 19:04:01 Hey WH moron-Cheap oil is no longer a huge positive for the US economy. Lower oil prices threaten to wipe out jobs, set off cash crunches at overleveraged frackers and depress business spending. The 2014-2016 oil crash caused many thousands of job cuts and dozens of bankruptcies.
9648 2018-12-02 19:03:56 some margarines are really bad for you so make sure they’re not hydrogenated! there are some really good coconut oil based ones that would still not be great for you but are much better!! softer butter substitutes are better as well!!

9650 2018-12-02 19:03:22 Well pal, shit off the taps to BC. Get rid of the carbon scam, stop transfer payments NOW. That’s my 3 top things to do to get shovels in the ground. I’m pro oil to the bone. It’s my bread and butter. O&G is NOT going anywhere EVER. These governments prov and feds are delusional.
9651 2018-12-02 19:03:21 Back in my day we used to call it an “oil change”
9652 2018-12-02 19:03:21 oh wow thank you!! 
but i just realized i have more access to olive oil soap bars which also are not a threat to the environment so yay switching to that 
9653 2018-12-02 19:03:20 Eh n before u realise there is no dipstick for oil check ndio utajua
9654 2018-12-02 19:03:16 I HATE the smell of Patchouli oil! Its disgusting and 75% of the women in the valley smell like it take a shower
9655 2018-12-02 19:03:09 bizzes the difference between when you put coconut oil on your coochie after shaving and not puttin coconut oil is so big!! do it trust me it get smooth down there
9656 2018-12-02 19:03:05 Okay:
1 can of chickpeas (garbanzo beans)
3 heaping tablespoons of tahini/tachina
2 tablespoons of oil
2 tablespoons of lemonjuice
2 teaspoons of salt
2 tablespoons of cumin
Blend until smooth

Of course you can adjust things like the tahini if you want more/less of that flavor
9657 2018-12-02 19:03:00 Want even more fun?  Whenever you post anything about fighting #ClimateChange make sure you tag #oilandgas. Oil industry bots may fav or retweet you! #ExxonKnew
9658 2018-12-02 19:03:00 And let’s not forget trying to raise those sanctions for the loans for the hotel would have also lifted sanctions on that 500 billion dollar oil deal for Putin 
9659 2018-12-02 19:02:54 Professional skin treatments are like oil changes for you car.

9660 2018-12-02 19:02:40 Not as the Xmas is approaching , just like last year! Now it's becoming clearer that the so called oil !marketers might av ulterior motives which is to destabilize the Xmas celebrations
9661 2018-12-02 19:02:34 But also oil
9662 2018-12-02 19:02:23 Vlad wants sanction relief for his Exxon deal,  individual 1 wants Moscow project,  Vlad dangles hotel,  holds out for oil.
9663 2018-12-02 19:02:20 Do NOT drive or walk through stagnant or m… RT @ realDonaldTrump: “Department of Justice will not be cutting oil production.
9664 2018-12-02 19:01:56 Trust me to have 0 oil in my car & my tyre pressures to be low ... a bit too low 
9665 2018-12-02 19:01:52 Snake oil salesman.
9666 2018-12-02 19:01:50 Drizzled in oil and salt then baked in the oven omg 
9667 2018-12-02 19:01:47 Has underwater oil/coal extraction caused any settling? If so, how much has it mitigated rising sea levels?

9669 2018-12-02 19:01:24 MyPOV: oil is found as well. by products are created.  data is found and insights are created from data.   =)
9670 2018-12-02 19:01:21 Just what's playing through my head...they be like, oh you need to wash the engine oil off your hair...
9671 2018-12-02 19:01:20 And continue buying Saudi Oil?   You must be from Quebec.
9672 2018-12-02 19:00:57 Crude oil prices have gone down by more then 20%. Government made more profit by not passing on this reduction to general public 
9673 2018-12-02 19:00:51 In many cases, palm oil plantations have replaced hugely biodiverss tropical rainforests & peatlands, which are also carbon sinks, with a monoculture. This change is adding 500 million tons of CO2 to the atmosphere per year. Palm oil workers poach pangolins in remaining forest.
9674 2018-12-02 19:00:49 And uses a motorboat which runs on oil .. i call this bullshit..
9675 2018-12-02 19:00:49 My family taught me that serve to my province was the greatest honour one could have.
You don’t do that by ignoring the issues in the oil patch. You do that by working to ensure that every single person who steps on site is protected and safe from harassment.

Not sure that's what happened with the oil rig. BP didn't know until it was too late.

9689 2018-12-02 18:59:39 So I lost my pen last night after having JUST bought new oil the day before....... I’ve no words
9690 2018-12-02 18:59:28 Please explain what oil drilling has to due with earthquakes...
9691 2018-12-02 18:59:21 Two years ago Saudi Arabia was flooding the market with oil FOR THE USA simply to bankrupt the Russians. It's amazing what one dumbass stooge can do to alliances around the world...
9692 2018-12-02 18:59:18 A guy at Harris Teeter accidentally told leyla the wrong aisle for canola oil and she popped off on a tangent about how men are completely useless lmao I hate her

9695 2018-12-02 18:58:47 This #Cameroon dictatorship is going down, no-matter the millions of $$ doled out to/by #lobby-ists to #FakeNews outlets & #Fake #HumanRights advocates, or #oil #pipeline shares divided amongst @UN officials by #French connected @UN official #Gadio. We'll find out & #Expose!
9696 2018-12-02 18:58:47 We have all the oil and gas/fossil fuel wells we need. US is energy independent. Drilling is an archaic act against humanity and environment.
9697 2018-12-02 18:58:44 @Iam_estan, @abiambo, you guys are educated, but, choose to be so empty, ignorant & senseless.

Imports, simply create jobs in d countries where d goods are produced.
 
We import all our petrol & diesel

Dangote's oil refinery will create over 100,000 jobs by 2019, when it starts
9698 2018-12-02 18:58:43 some lucky guy dey bring baby oil for rub down

9706 2018-12-02 18:57:40 It's so sad these snake oil salesmen exist, preying on people. Just another scam artist
9707 2018-12-02 18:57:40 Gun oil? What ever happened to just cycle it harder?
9708 2018-12-02 18:57:33 Oil well casing too
9709 2018-12-02 18:57:27 Maybe we should soak them in cannabis oil when they're born
9710 2018-12-02 18:57:13 The way the Giants keep letting Curtis Riley start at FS is comparable to the way BP knew about that oil leak on that rig but kept on going like everything is okay..... that shit is gonna blow up on you, people are gonna hate you for it and it’s gonna cost you something... Wins.
9711 2018-12-02 18:56:55 Don't forget, Saddam Hussein was the US stooge. The US gave him the go ahead to invade Kuwait because Kuwait was stealing oil from Iraq. Margaret Tatcher came to the US and spoke with Bush. Then they turned on Saddam. 

And yes, the US used armor penetrating uranium munitions.
9712 2018-12-02 18:56:43 As much as I appreciate dis, it'll be nice to know if there's an increase in d export of local goods other than crude oil within same period. It makes no sense if imports reduced due to bad economy and loss of investors confidence. I'll advice you balance d report with figures.
9713 2018-12-02 18:56:43 Indeed, he thought no one could hear his extremely cheesy one liners that is why he uttered it so confidently, had he known she was spying on him, he would have started cooking at once. Nonetheless, he had began heating up a pan with some oil in it and grabbed a few eggs.
9714 2018-12-02 18:56:25 i’d drink car oil before unsweet tea
9715 2018-12-02 18:56:22 I wanna start making one free beat a month for everyone in town to use. Whoever bodies it the best gets a free oil change
9716 2018-12-02 18:56:21 I love mixing tree oil with aloe vera to put on my face it helps majorly with redness and acne
9717 2018-12-02 18:56:18 People used to think the ocean was a carbon sink to dump everything into because there’s just so much ocean that nothing could go wrong, and after realizing even the ocean has limits, people really think “No need for alternative energy, oil reservoirs will last forever.”
9718 2018-12-02 18:56:06 @theJagmeetSingh on QP displayed that he had zero comprehension of national issues. The reason that we are getting $10 for oil is a complete breakdown of getting any one of 4 pipelines to a market. And @NavdeepSBains patting himself for buying TMX is due to Libs ineptitude
9719 2018-12-02 18:56:03 Amazing how we whitewash our politicians. “Whitewash” is appropriate  for someone who voted against civil rights and launched an ugly race baiting campaign (Willie Horton). Then there’s a war for oil and Clarence Thomas, etc. I know death is sad but he wasn’t a saint. May he RIP.
9720 2018-12-02 18:55:52 I want someone to oil my scalp
9721 2018-12-02 18:55:48 A fair few of them also use palm oil too 
9722 2018-12-02 18:55:38 He has cast down the Trumps and Dutertes from their thrones and lifted up the migrants and the drug users. He has filled the hungry with good things and sent the Jeff Bezoses and oil tycoons away empty.
9723 2018-12-02 18:55:35 You know, Mr. Prime Minister, I think this is great and all.
But I wonder how many oil rail cars $50 M might buy.
Maybe help a province whose major industry is in trouble, too? One that has consequences for all of Canada.
Ca plàne pour vous? Alors, faisons-le!
9724 2018-12-02 18:55:09 And there is also a interesting side analogy. The ‘oil tins’ standard oil gave away, the standardization on a formula... compare to what #AWS is doing, their attempts to define standards, etc.

9728 2018-12-02 18:54:14 lol, no, the problem is nobody wants tar oil anymore. It is not worth processing when the world has an over supply of far better oil.
There is nothing that can fix that.

9735 2018-12-02 18:53:26 Yup but macron's letting his people suffer high ever climbing tax on oil because of his belief in climate change. Sad

9739 2018-12-02 18:53:09 Don't disagree there.  But effective carbon pricing (which is an immediate need) will result in less need for oil, i.e. "demand" - as you say.  Aren't you arguing against yourself?  Water crisis is also on horizon.  Canada cannot afford to destroy finite water resources.
9740 2018-12-02 18:53:01 He actually didn't find much oil. Mostly old money.
9741 2018-12-02 18:52:57 Here’s what’s been working for me: Paula’s Choice oil balancing cleanser at night with nuetrogena’s hydroboost water gel, and miscellar water in the morning with the hydroboost spf. Also the oil balancing mask for oily days and hydroboost mask for dry days

9748 2018-12-02 18:52:20 These are caused by neither dictatorship nor democracy .USA & co aren't  that much fool enough to spend trillions to just overthrow the dictatorship & establish democracy.

9750 2018-12-02 18:52:12 let's analyze why people are fighting and gas prices are rising,  ITS BECAUSE THE FRENCH PRESIDENT STAYED IN PARIS ACCORDS, AND HAS ISSUED OIL TAX THAT WILL CLIMB EVERY YEAR. SO THE PRICE WILL ONLY GO UP. THEIR IDIOT LEADER MACRON WILL SUFFER HIS PEOPLE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. SAD.
9751 2018-12-02 18:52:04 Gotcha, if I remember right it was #00. Somebody from that crew gave me a case of oil at a race at Lonestar that year. (Refused $) I think your dad was racing that one too. I do remember some great racing at that 1/2 mile!
9752 2018-12-02 18:51:59 True but we won’t run out for quite a while. US is still #1 in oil production and Trump has been opening up land and oceans for drilling/fracking/pipelines since his 1st day in office. The problem is only getting worse.
9753 2018-12-02 18:51:55 The Pompiers are also Emergency Services so their spec is a little wider.  Add that they are now being called up to be armed, act like Army in a State of Emergency.  Bit of a difference.  Simply put, Macron wants to turn them from a fire/medical response group to an armed arm ...
9754 2018-12-02 18:51:55 the oil can stain, but the underpants add such a complex flavor to whatever you cook in them that it's worth it.
9755 2018-12-02 18:51:42 Never quite understood why this tinpot nation needed the very best a/c.. after all we only tend to fight when the US go in or oil is involved!
9756 2018-12-02 18:51:40 i agree we need better urban infrastructure to attract more people away from their white picket fences. i wish mayors ruled the world, but cities are the least empowered to raise funds for great ideas like urban ecology. state and federal are beholden to oil companies.

9760 2018-12-02 18:51:24 Sweet almond oil, jojoba oil, tea tree oil, peppermint oil, JBCO. Sunny Isle, As I am, Cantu, The Mane Choice are brands you can't go wrong with . Moisturize, and deep condition regularly. Protective styling is key as well as hot oil treatment & frequent scalp massages.
9761 2018-12-02 18:51:16 Never use coconut oil or any products with coconut in it if you have acne prone skin. Worst mistake ever

9766 2018-12-02 18:50:34 Has Haiti ever thought of getting into palm oil plantations?
9767 2018-12-02 18:50:34 Olive oil isn’t great for deep frying because of how smokey it is.
9768 2018-12-02 18:50:21 Read my lips no new taxes, and he goes and increases taxes, and that's why he was one term president. Like his son a light Democrat, globalist, New World Order. He enriched the rich with oil dealings, and destroyed our economy. God bless his soul and rest in peace!
9769 2018-12-02 18:50:19 Careful what you wish for. He's not nearly as awful as peopel make him out to be, but he's not a great PM. For example, he wants to combat climate change but still gives subsidies to oil and fossil fuel companies. He didn't deliver on many of his promises, like electoral reform
9770 2018-12-02 18:50:00 Well u hv a good sense of humour but that cannot overrule the hard facts.Such Macroeconomic changes sometimes have huge impact on microeconomy because things like crude oil purchase can be broken into fragments and each fragment plays an important role in shaping the microeconomy
9771 2018-12-02 18:49:59 Did you use any oil or anything?
9772 2018-12-02 18:49:59 Small fries compared to relaxing Russian sanctions & the oil deal they hoped for with Tillerson.
9773 2018-12-02 18:49:56 Don't explore for oil by explosion either! It kills fish and ruins the ability of dolphins and whales to navigate. They must not do this!
9774 2018-12-02 18:49:49 Krill oil is amazing, I used to suffer so badly and taking these guys really eased the pain and anxiety @CleanmarineIrl
9775 2018-12-02 18:49:45 After hustling we share with neighbours & relatives, even a tablespoon of cooking oil. We don't see anyone as a fool. We believe we r setting a good example 4 our kids to understand that not all problems r solved by violence.

9778 2018-12-02 18:49:14 How was HW Bush a warmonger for defending Kuwait against an invasion that was done to steal their oil? Or an intervention to depose a military dictator?
9779 2018-12-02 18:49:13 Peppermint oil! I use it religiously for anxiety and nausea. I carry a lil bottle of it on me everyday and I never go anywhere without it.

9783 2018-12-02 18:49:05 we take olive oil very seriously!!!! 
9784 2018-12-02 18:49:04 みんなで油祭りしようよ。英訳するとオイルフェスティバル。
9785 2018-12-02 18:48:57 Facts and Liberals are oil and water. The FBI coined the term 
" conspiracy theory " after the assassination of JFK to * shame* anyone that questioned there being more than one shooter.
9786 2018-12-02 18:48:53 We can’t have disturbing images on this site.
9787 2018-12-02 18:48:52 Ghana's major exports are gold, cocoa, the recent crude oil. Ghana manages prudently their scarse foreign earners to develop their country and improve the lives of their citizens. The drop in crude oil export for Nigeria is not excuse for our dying Economy.
9788 2018-12-02 18:48:51 There's nary a candle nor a drop of whale oil in this desolate abode.
9789 2018-12-02 18:48:44 And what was his proudest achievement under “Ws” admin? The secret oil deal, or the yellowcake affair?
Another disgraceful American politician elevated by Chuck Todd. Shocking, I know. 
You hang in there Chuck, sooner or later you’ll find an honest Republican
9790 2018-12-02 18:48:32 YOU WILL TRADE YOUR OIL IN FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES... OR ELSE!
9791 2018-12-02 18:48:22 @CNN "Trump curing cancer is no longer a huge positive for ill people"

"Cheap oil is no longer a huge positive for the US economy"
9792 2018-12-02 18:48:22 Chop up a couple of onions and chiluck in a pot with olive oil. Chop up some square sausage & chuck in the same pot to brown. Peel some potatoes, carrot & turnip(swede). Slice the veg chuck in the same pot. Top up with water and let it simmer for a while. 40 mins minimum
9793 2018-12-02 18:48:14 I wouldn’t say it’s redeeming necessarily, but he has an innate ability to sell himself to the ignorant and arrogant! Superb snake oil salesman!
9794 2018-12-02 18:48:10 Solid beard! It's honestly long enough for a light application of oil and a run with a comb. Balm might be a bit much for it right now since it's short enough you don't really need help controlling it (so it seems). 
Looks pretty solid whatever you're doing to it so far!
9795 2018-12-02 18:48:07 can’t find the brand of tree oil I use my face anymore so back to sweet almond oil. 
9796 2018-12-02 18:47:56 @FakeHutchNews : Without the HutchNews I never would have known that the West Texas Intermediate crude oil price is no longer a benchmark  for oil markets...it is a company located somewhere in West Texas. 
9797 2018-12-02 18:47:45 I know someone who never smoked,  saw through cigarette company cover ups,  yet  thinks nothing of oil companies lying about climate change.  Yeesh.
9798 2018-12-02 18:47:42 You've probably used, worn, or touched 100 things made from oil just this morning in your fossil fuel heated home. Stop blowing smoke, just stop.
9799 2018-12-02 18:47:35 @repbrianmast @marcorubio @SenBillNelson: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast
9800 2018-12-02 18:47:27 Do you see $oil still moving in lock-step with SPX?
9801 2018-12-02 18:47:22 You don't know about stealing oil? Seriously? How do you explain 7 wars since 9/11 without any of them being against a country that actually played a role in Sept 11th? What's the motivation if not for resource control?
9802 2018-12-02 18:47:22 Use coconut oil brother..so good
9803 2018-12-02 18:47:16 Take the next step @SecretaryZinke after cancelling the #ChacoCanyon oil/gas lease --  give the land permanent protection!
9804 2018-12-02 18:47:12 Since the dispute between Iraq and Kuwait was border issue, it can be blamed on Britain as the arbiter of the border; however, Kuwait never had a fixed border, since the whole thing is just desert. It only became an issue when oil was discovered in the desert.
9805 2018-12-02 18:46:59 To be fair, this issue has also been broached by other administrations.  In ‘14, the Obama Administration allowed seismic testing for oil exploration along the East Coast.  Hopefully, impact to Marine life is minimal.
9806 2018-12-02 18:46:59 TrudeauI wage & price controls & NEP policies that created havoc & hurt Canadians. 
TrudeauII killed pipelines to landlock oil, #CARBONTAX creating havoc & hurting Canadians today. I have been around for TrudeauI & living thru nightmare of TrudeauII.
9807 2018-12-02 18:46:58 Don’t try this without working up to it. I’ve just subsisted for 48 hours on nothing but water, a bit of salt, and coffee with butter and MCT oil blended in. I’ve experienced no hunger whatsoever, and I gave it loads at three high intensity gym classes. 1/2
9808 2018-12-02 18:46:54 Yes girl. I am so irritated. I’ve had to talk to the Kia place for the past 4 days about what’s going on. I was gonna take my car to get an oil change before I started my new job, but I’m afraid to take it up there. I don’t want them to keep it.
9809 2018-12-02 18:46:39 Obviously a keeper.
9810 2018-12-02 18:46:29 use vitamin E oil for your skin in the winter!!! Save yourself!!!
9811 2018-12-02 18:46:25 Put castor oil on them a few times a day it makes them grow quicker (same with hair and lashes)
9812 2018-12-02 18:46:09 Nigeria loses $6bn from shady oil deal.., shameful!!!
9813 2018-12-02 18:46:08 You would rather have the #oil companies gouge us? Gov tax leaves less room for gouging & at least the money goes back to the public. Price carbon & people/companies look for ways to save. Economics 101, my friend.

9814 2018-12-02 18:46:07 The foreign policy of the USA

US President Donald Trump has said that it does not matter if the crown prince ordered the killing of Khashoggi, who lived near Washington because the kingdom is a major buyer of arms, supplier of oil and opponent of Iran.
9815 2018-12-02 18:46:01 Nice! Oil pan needs placing due to damage from bottoming out?
9816 2018-12-02 18:45:55 use tea tree oil to dry it up if u aren’t yet
9817 2018-12-02 18:45:47 Shea butter isn't an essential oil. Lol

9821 2018-12-02 18:45:16 Olive Oil
9822 2018-12-02 18:45:08 Ahhhh thank you so much!! I hope that each candle imparts a sense of ritual, beauty and lets the midnight oil FLOW.
9823 2018-12-02 18:45:06 it seems that whenever an instance of edible oil hits penne pasta, its the equivalent of sex because holy shit 

it doesnt add to taste- that's another factor, but i could snack on the creamy spinach/sausage penne i made all day
9824 2018-12-02 18:45:06 Olbas oil (combo of mint, cajuput, eucalyptus, juniper and others) is literally the only way I can breathe easy and stop coughing when I get super ill

9826 2018-12-02 18:44:53 Jeff, no doubt he was a war veteran, a hero. However he was a globalist, enriching the rich, especially with oil, and destroying our economy, and increasing taxes. He was a globalist as his son is. A light Democrat, pushing for immigration and open borders like his son.
9827 2018-12-02 18:44:46 What is not yet mentioned in all these corrupt quid pro quo deals, is the Rosneft Oil Company deal & who also benefited there?
9828 2018-12-02 18:44:42 Olive oil is passé. Use LEDs.

Thank you. I'll be here all week.
9829 2018-12-02 18:44:42 Anything citrus. I have a bracelet for my essential oil. I put a few drops on it in the morning, and it helps with energy and stress.

9831 2018-12-02 18:44:28 I wonder what government reaction would have been if an oil rich country killed 120 000 disabled people?
9832 2018-12-02 18:44:24 Markets were mixed on Friday, with the S&P500 equities index up 0.8%, and US dollar higher, but US bond yields and oil prices lower. The eagerly awaited Trump-Xi meeting at G20 resulted in a 90-day ceasefire on trade tariffs.
9833 2018-12-02 18:44:23 eucalyptus oil & peppermint to relieve migraines and stomach aches 
9834 2018-12-02 18:44:16 She's paid by ExxonMobil and Lee Raymond has been on their board among other oil executives do so you can't expect her to be truthful.
9835 2018-12-02 18:43:52 Watermelon extract for discoloration. Castor oil for hair growth (eyebrows, eyelashes too)
9836 2018-12-02 18:43:45 I tried lavender oil once as I heard it was meant to help with sleeping, turns out I’m highly allergic and came out with a rash on my face lmao
9837 2018-12-02 18:43:41 You are complicit in the con. Tony Robbins is a charlatan who uses physical & emotional intimidation to prey on the most vulnerable. It's very disturbing to see you peddle his snake oil. #grifter
9838 2018-12-02 18:43:37 I seem to recall while Obama was President, that he had NO control of rising oil prices and there was nothing he could do.  Just another lie from the worst President in history.  He  accomplished NOTHING in 8 yrs.
9839 2018-12-02 18:43:33 [Andre beamed, immediately putting on the bracelet with some adjustment, and taking in the cologne oil. His eyes were glassy when he looked back up at them, and he immediately hugged them fiercely, showering them both with kisses.]
Thank you, both of you, so much.

9842 2018-12-02 18:43:32 still pissed that we’re destroying rainforests and killing orangutans for palm oil for stuff like brownie mix ??!?!!?! idk about any of you but i feel like orangutans are a bit more important than brownies /:

9844 2018-12-02 18:43:27 Goes without saying crude has reduce by 30%.. Rupee has strengthen by 5%.. Govt is busy levying oil randsom
9845 2018-12-02 18:43:26 From what I heard of the people that were there he either cracked his oil pan & blew, or he ran out of gas. Needless to say he got caught 
9846 2018-12-02 18:43:19 EVERYONE SHUT THE FUCK UP

I GOT ACCEPTED INTO A HIGH PAYING OIL POLYTECHNIC
9847 2018-12-02 18:43:15 Wonderful picture. Just the wrong Shawn Reed tagged in the write up.
9848 2018-12-02 18:43:12 Doesn't he cancel that out though but not promoting taking care of the environment and placing an oil pipeline on Indian reservations, which one spilled tons of oil which polluted the air and water?
9849 2018-12-02 18:43:12 But of course. The mammon-loving OIL'igarchs' short term profits matter more than the long term greater good for people and planet.
9850 2018-12-02 18:43:06 Bergamot, chamomile ....I do love basil. Mostly for anxiety. To give a calm and sense of peace. I mix with almond oil and then add the oil blend to lotion. Or use in a roller ball on adenoids for quick absorption.
9851 2018-12-02 18:43:01 Ask any woman in an oil town about the impact of male workers in their community. It’s clear you haven’t.
9852 2018-12-02 18:43:00 Yes. But the business involved selling the independence of our country!!!!! 
Not just for Trump Tower Moscow but for a % of Russian oil profits from state controlled oil giant Rosneft.
9853 2018-12-02 18:42:58 I’m having ramen for dinner and then downing castor oil and green tea at midnight
9854 2018-12-02 18:42:58 wht is cbd oil and why is everyone using it now
9855 2018-12-02 18:42:55 So scrap oil and go to wind and solar? How'd that work out for Germany and Austraila?

9857 2018-12-02 18:42:47 I really like putting spearmint and lavender in with clothes when i wash them and orange with the towels and socks. I also cucumber seed oil in baths and when my face is dry.
9858 2018-12-02 18:42:36 He single handily put many small oil service companies out of business by stopping all permitting in the Gulf of Mexico. The best way for him to protect his legacy is to remain silent about it and hook up with Jimmy Carter and build low income housing.
9859 2018-12-02 18:42:29 Not just tragic. Immensely cruel. Whales beach bleeding out of every orifice. The babies no longer nurse.
For lethal oil for sheer greed.
Truly evil.
9860 2018-12-02 18:42:28 Right. So by that logic you can eat as much butter, steak, olive oil, nuts, cheese, salmon, etc etc without ever gaining weight?
9861 2018-12-02 18:42:12 Oil was $26 in Feb 2016 and 10yr bond was 1.4%. The economy was not doing well at the time. ROPEC was trying to crush both shale and upcoming "mega-projects" along with Elon Musk's car and solar panels. It was a war and USA pulled through luckily. ROPEC isn't going to repeat.

9863 2018-12-02 18:42:10 But Mam, crude oil price in international market have been reduced by more than 25%. More over our rupee had become stronger against dollee. 

But petrol nd diesel prices reduced by only 10-12% .

Why?

9865 2018-12-02 18:42:05 @fordnation To Doug Ford concerning Calgary school buses.
5 School buses have been removed from service, are you going to tell us that this is so devastating that other buses can't have routes modified to cover these 5! Perhaps Calgary should rethink giving oil and gas drilling
9866 2018-12-02 18:42:01 Happy 1st day of #Chanukah, everyone! Today we celebrate that the Menorah oil that should’ve lasted for one night lasted for eight whole nights. 

Unlike my camera battery every single shoot.
9867 2018-12-02 18:41:57 He could have said the exact same about oil workers. 

We can look at North Dakota and all the new brothels.

9879 2018-12-02 18:40:44 Eucalyptus for my RLS, works bout 70% of the time so I can sleep. Spearamint for my son- allergies. Tea tree oil in the diffuser. My son was born at 27 weeks and very unhealthy. Not had pneumonia in 4 years after suffering quarterly with it and hospitals three times yearly.
9880 2018-12-02 18:40:42 Exactly. The scale of these fund flows & position shifts is beyond oil market participants other than sovereign states
9881 2018-12-02 18:40:30 I'm torn. CBD Oil from Hemp has the same medical benefits as CBD from marijuana. I am totally anti narcotic, mind altering drugs but babies that have seizures are helped greatly with CBD. I'm torn.
9882 2018-12-02 18:40:28 How are you using badam oil?? I have baaaaad dark circles that no amount of concealer would conceal  though I’m 100% certain I’m using concealer incorrectly lol!
9883 2018-12-02 18:40:26 Iran sells most of it's oil to China and buys a lot of Chinese military hardware. That's their alliance.

Where all these other Chinese allies you refer to that will help China in a military conflict over the US?. You don't know sheet about geo-political alliances.

9890 2018-12-02 18:40:05 Happy Hanukkah to everyone. I would like to share a tweet I read earlier:
“The miracle of Hanukkah isn’t that the oil burned for eight days. It’s that the candles burned for 2000 years.”
9891 2018-12-02 18:40:01 This falls into what I think is a gray area category of how lies work in a social setting.

Yes, oil industry spends billions saturating our social environment w/ lies.

But consumer preferences for living in sprawl were result of lies told by an entirely different set of liars.

9895 2018-12-02 18:39:48 Thanks Mark very expensive for only 4000 miles every two oil changes so I’m thinking nah to fancy plugs probably neg performance just coupe better with heat
9896 2018-12-02 18:39:45 boggles the mind why anybody wants to take credit for surging oil production on Public Lands - no new drilling or fracking needs to be done to ensure enough fossil fuel to provide for needs while cleaner less polluting energy resources are developed and installed around the world

9906 2018-12-02 18:38:59 Replacing Canadian oil with Venezuelan heavy oil (Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves) wouldn't help at all. And you can see that the bulk of emissions comes from actually burning the oil, not producing it. Hence the need to use carbon pricing to cut *demand*.

9919 2018-12-02 18:38:01 Cut the tax, and stop shipping gasoline and diesel down the TMX. Ship only oil for export.
9920 2018-12-02 18:37:54 let him take credit for the global warming that will come about from all the oil "he produced".   shouldn't the left want to crucify him for being a climate change causer?
9921 2018-12-02 18:37:41 Yup. Lived in an oil town. One company had to shut down for a couple of days because no one passed the drug test. Do you think these guys went home (rented room) or to the bar? Got around issue by announcing when drug testing would be done. Couldn't fire everyone.
9922 2018-12-02 18:37:38 @LBC The bloke from NE England had a good point.  They've had a bad deal while Aberdeen has had a good one with North Sea Oil, but we lost our Fishing.  While they seemed to have lost everything.
9923 2018-12-02 18:37:29 You're wrong my friend. We do here in Quebec. Costa Rica does it too. Number of EU countries are on the way. Oil and gas is on the way out!
9924 2018-12-02 18:37:27 I love tea tree oil!! It just smells so relaxing and I use it with lavender to calm my stress and headaches
9925 2018-12-02 18:37:12 My candles, facial oil, and lepidolite crystal from @spacevaluee came in the mail yesterday  I’ve already been connecting with my lepidolite and I used the facial oil this morning (in LOVE), and I can’t wait to burn the candles!

9930 2018-12-02 18:36:48 Markets will do well on the back of this, just need Opec and the Russians to cut oil production by a million BOD and the Christmas bull run will be on.
9931 2018-12-02 18:36:45 Standard Oil became a monopoly in the free market without government intervention.

Granted, later competition DID spring up, but only because you can't monopolize oil for long... it's everywhere.

This idea that ONLY government can create monopolies is just plain BS.
9932 2018-12-02 18:36:38 Nah we look at our UCL titles to laugh at the oil money cluba
9933 2018-12-02 18:36:36 If KSA rolls back to 10.06Mbpd they will have contributed fairly. That is what their last quotas was before summer. I don't call that being kicked. Keep the oil in the ground for a later day at a much higher price! They need to refill storage. Only have 20 days in storage now.

9935 2018-12-02 18:36:30 This is the key question, because if it came from individuals, it makes sense many would be from that industry (given the amount of people working in Oil & Gas in TX).
9936 2018-12-02 18:36:29 lol, no it is nobody wants their oil. No amount of reductions in production or increase in shipping will fix that.

9939 2018-12-02 18:36:14 I’ve only been putting water and oil on my locs and they are growing so good.
9940 2018-12-02 18:36:14 I use EVOO as my do everything oil. And I probably shouldn't. I think canola or vegetable oil would be better. Maybe? I don't  know. I don't really spray on anything else. Honestly, they'll probably all end up being filled with different flavors of olive oil.

9954 2018-12-02 18:34:43 The oil industry is partly to blame for us not reducing demand, because of their decades of lying and predatory delay. It makes no sense to separate them from the denial industry--they are a key part of it, and ignoring that fact won't make them go away.
9955 2018-12-02 18:34:39 Chamomile & lemongrass! I got dryer wool balls off @amazon to replace my dryer sheets! so when I dry my clothes, I put 10 drops of whichever on the dryer balls (they absorb the oil) & toss them in to dry with the clothes! They also reduce static!!
9956 2018-12-02 18:34:36 Let's hope she also cuts shipments of lighter oil to the rest of Canada, although that is very unlikely. The rest of Canada needs a wakeup call. Unfortunately Notley makes bold dramatic statements and gestures, but then it usually just fizzles out.

9979 2018-12-02 18:32:29 Perfect analogy. Your 50? 100? Watt solar panel on a shed in your backyard (installed at the optimal angle?) gives you free electricity. You complain that it doesn’t last long enough, (likely a tiny battery)and say go back to oil, like your great grandmother did. UCP thinking.

9991 2018-12-02 18:31:02 Nope. I bought "robust flavor" olive oil yesterday that will be going in one of them. Regular olive oil goes in my big one. Maybe I should put canola oil in the big one. Anyway, no. Not yet.

10001 2018-12-02 18:30:14 A Government mandated oil production cut in Alberta can be seen in Ottawa as nothing less than a total victory over the energy industry, if those cuts are not accompanied by a suspension of the Carbon Tax.

10005 2018-12-02 18:29:50 Good!! Biggest scam in human political history is price gouging when it comes to the price of oil/gas..
10006 2018-12-02 18:29:49 Why not switch now then?  If it just will happen magically when needed, why hasn't that magic occurred yet?  Oil will run out if we use it all up.  If we slow down it will last longer, and that gives us more time to avoid jarring economic impacts.  This really isn't complicated.
