Be better.

Mobile mining is a glorified wallet. What this will do for many disadvantaged enabling them to pay their phone bill and run ads on FB. Show a Crypto doing more?

9 2018-01-30 23:58:57 In the light of recent news and trends in the crypto market, many people are franctically reacting, resulting in poor trades. This is the reason why ever investor should create a plan for possible outcomes. Take profit at x. Set stop loss at x. Buy more at x. #CryptocurrencyNews
