38 2018-04-18 22:13:19 Not only do they get food stamps but then get commodities which they can't use, then they throw away, sell on facebook, or trade for other stuff. When the food bank came into our county we lost our last grocery store. Now we have to go 30miles to a store.

42 2018-04-18 21:20:27 BRF (e suas componentes) enfrentaram situaçoes de commodities muito mais críticas antes., com resultados bem melhores. Não é por aí.
43 2018-04-18 21:19:44 Eita generalização perigosa. Pedro Parente é privativista e está na Petrobras para vender o que puder. As ações caíram devido a queda radical das commodities e devido a lava-jato. Agora os valores do petróleo subiram.
44 2018-04-18 21:15:19 How about leaving them alone and letting them live their lives instead of turning them into commodities.
45 2018-04-18 21:12:10 Via @ErikKostelnik: The way that job postings, resumes, and public profiles became commodities, AI will be a commodity too." #paraphrasing #tatechvegas
46 2018-04-18 21:11:46 I would like to fade that as well. But with commodities breaking higher, the inflation narrative can push yields higher to around 3.10.
47 2018-04-18 21:11:09 Guess you haven’t checked the markets today, or yesterday or this week... or maybe ever? Commodities rise and fall, that’s the way things work.

53 2018-04-18 20:46:07 This is a stupendous task and will require hard work by enforcement officers. Increasing direct taxation will benefit the people in the long run as cuts can be made on indirect taxation bringing down the prices of various commodities.
54 2018-04-18 20:44:47 Hopefully slooooowly...... let's not spook anyone until we get a nice run in small growth and commodities.

56 2018-04-18 20:32:39 Hinduism has always been a patriarchal and racist religion that considers women as commodities and Dalits as sub-humans. So this whole discussion of Temple being holy sites is pointless. Those are and have always been sites of oppression and exploitation. #KathuaHorror #Asifa
57 2018-04-18 20:11:32 I don't think it matters how coherent it is.  They're clearly coded in ways that mirror anti-semitic stereotypes about gold-obsessed bankers, etc.  Add in a cultural rejection of commodities and private propery, and boom you've got the Nazi idea of the banker/bolsheviks.
58 2018-04-18 19:56:09 Again, I could be misremembering, but I think someone actually says they don't understand "human ideas of property" - which puts private property and commodities in our genes, I guess.
59 2018-04-18 19:55:44 The same way it was irrational to have oil in the 30's, so shall it be when oil is triple digits again. #Comex doesn't create a fair price, it usually takes a price from one extreme to the other. #Commodities very well known for their boom and bust cycles. #OOTT

61 2018-04-18 19:52:18 Marc fwiw and you probably know this but Rogers actually likes gold the least out of all commodities cause it is least dependend on mining output right. Dont know if you agree?
62 2018-04-18 19:51:46 a direita brasileira é apenas o segundo escalão do golpe, os americanos estão no comando dessa liquidação do Brasil. Vão tomar tudo de assalto e seremos apenas um fazendão de produção de commodities c/mão de obra barata.
63 2018-04-18 19:47:19 I’m sorry u think it was personal. It’s just the best example available. I’ve used similar comparisons in the past in other discussions & based on yrs of watching & meeting people who’ve lived under that tyranny I’m not a fan.

3)Vol: VIX para cima

70 2018-04-18 19:14:13 What are you lot gassing on about THE Customs Union and A Customs Union are two totally different commodities.

71 2018-04-18 19:09:47 Nurses are not politicians,why not say your crap to the shops and various other sectors who have raised prices of commodities that the same nurses buy??
72 2018-04-18 19:09:25 why the rotation into commodities? weak dollar? global growth???
73 2018-04-18 19:07:40 Since the tax law came about, gas prices have risen, food prices have risen, the amount for the happy meal I received went away when the price of basic commodities went up. The economy pretty much killed the tax cut.

84 2018-04-18 18:12:43 True, but in a world where ag continues to expand into tropical forests, intensification in US (or reduced meat consumption in US) might not mean freeing up US farmland but rather preventing conversion of forest to farm elsewhere (since we are talking about global commodities).

89 2018-04-18 17:53:43 the basic target functions of "investing" in stocks, bonds, or commodities is REALLY simple= "Buy Low then Sell High" ..the definition of what is LOW & HIGH is impacted by whether you're a short or medium or long term investor but the notion you buy & HOLD (NEVER SELL) is MORONiC

94 2018-04-18 17:40:40 Long rates have had every chance to go down over the last month and they have not responded. Positioning or not, they likely move higher here. Commodities up. Weak auctions. German yields bottoming. Relative value on short end of curve. Fundamentals win versus positioning here.
95 2018-04-18 17:39:36 Commodities should not give you entitlement, nor a feeling of superiority in any aspect. Your money doesn’t make you, what you posses mentally and spiritually does.
96 2018-04-18 17:38:25 I have no clue who he / it is. CNN is pure garbage - it’s on at work on our commodities trading floor and it’s nothing but garbage headlines about the slightest concern, issue, with Trump.  Their political labels are worthless and obfuscatory.  That is my point.

101 2018-04-18 17:31:18 Dangerous signs and today’s sharp rally in many commodities should be a warning for equity investors. Many metals surged today- nickel up 8% but gold and silver too having a strong day. Particularly like silver- currently +2% but still only 1/3 of where it was in 1980!

103 2018-04-18 17:28:20 He doesnt want anything to be politicised while he is in power. No price rises of essential commodities, economy not growing,  employment opp's on a free fall. ..nothing  shud be poticised. Clz only he has d right to do so
104 2018-04-18 17:23:36 Sorry only got a notification for the last comment, now it makes more sense. My counter to your very valid points would be the average landlord might not have a clue about commodities or judging business plans. House as an investment are deemed to be "as safe as houses".

117 2018-04-18 16:47:43 @Moneybox I have just set up an account with a FX/Crypto/commodities web brokerage and before funding the account I did some research. I'm pretty sure this a fraudulent website offering windfall returns on investment of min Eur 3,000 and over. Would you like more info?

127 2018-04-18 16:14:58 Agreed. Trump team are amateurs in foreign trade policy and the impulsive brashness only impresses the rubes. Many farmers are far more savvy about international commodities markets than Trumps “economic advisors.”
128 2018-04-18 16:14:32 Russell 2000 Index and commodities are rallying while the long term rates and $USD indices are relatively stable. This looks bullish. S&P 500 Index should follow also higher. $SPX $RUT $DBC

148 2018-04-18 15:30:07 Cocoa... I mean, look at price and market history. More traders loose money dicking around in that (maybe coffee and OJ too) market. Of all the commodities to mention...especially when there are stories in beans/corn/tariffs.

94% of farm aid goes to 6 commodities: corn, cotton, peanuts, rice, soybeans, & wheat.
These 6 commodities represent only 28% of agricultural production.

344 2018-04-18 05:14:44 China contributes around 35% global growth and more than a half consumption of major commodities. Therefore, any movements of stock market caused by fundamental will impact other assets. That's explained!

352 2018-04-18 04:53:52 Property and commodities will be a good chunk. Banks and the wealthy will gobble them all up again like less than 100 years ago.
353 2018-04-18 04:53:16 Commodities which are exchanged through regulated markets, like stock exchanges, are going to continue to be valuable. Moderate/minor taxes on those things would certainly change behavior a bit, but I don't think we'd see dramatic market restructuring.

363 2018-04-18 04:26:56 A balance sheet of what? And how has the borrowing impacted the economy as regards prices of essential commodities? 

Your economics tells you the FR means the economy is healthy. Why are prices not dropping considering the high debt & investments you allude to?

365 2018-04-18 04:14:31 “The three outliers (commodities) are connected to particular political and monetary issues, and may be excused from obeying Simon’s law.”
Chief of these of course is gold. Which apparently is exempt because it is a “traditional store of value.”
366 2018-04-18 04:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.

368 2018-04-18 03:57:27 That may work for commodities. You're making it seem like government is the only barrier to entry.

371 2018-04-18 03:41:06 Need to store all d books we have, for our grandchildren. D value will rise in d future like all rare commodities.
372 2018-04-18 03:20:51 Let me put something into perspective really quick- California alone feeds 90% of the United States and 70% of the rest of the world with our commodities alone. A majority of those commodities are produces here in the Central Valley.
373 2018-04-18 03:15:29 A+F sold catalogs that were hot commodities back in the day
374 2018-04-18 03:09:08 And don't ask me how those brainless sub-humans are going to maintain their system, when no one is able to afford their produced commodities around the world? Hehehe
375 2018-04-18 03:05:55 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
376 2018-04-18 02:58:33 Until you overleverage those commodities and it then becomes a massive liability
377 2018-04-18 02:53:44 The new bull market in commodities is unlikely to be kind to India.  It needs to redouble efforts on solar & move away from oil if it wants robust growth.
378 2018-04-18 02:49:17 They run a deficit in oil and commodities.
379 2018-04-18 02:44:22 Giving everything to your partner and nothing to yourself isn't a great  legacy. It's a disgrace that the world treated women like commodities and put no monetary value on our work. This disgrace has been happening for 1000s of years.
380 2018-04-18 02:38:16 The banker who trades in commodities is a murderer.
381 2018-04-18 02:30:22 “Companies in commodities and supply chain weren’t fundamentally disrupted by the internet, now with sensors deployed... they can see what’s happening in their own supply chain and competitors can see what’s happening, too” - Mark Johnson, CEO, Descartes Labs #ChurchillClub
382 2018-04-18 02:21:17 I don't know that they were lesser commodities at all. Alexa was equal to Charlotte in terms of recent Championship pedigree. Same with KO and Wyatt. Ambrose for New Day was a huge boon for SD, I think. Only real steal for Raw was Miz, who DB just wanted gone.
383 2018-04-18 02:18:39 At the time they were the lesser commodities, but as a full and complete roster now with the new additions smackdown looks more of an equal show now...
Who knows in 2months we could be looking at a dumpster fire again lol
384 2018-04-18 02:12:14 And what about rapes, poor educational institutions, poor healthcare, ever increasing price of food and necessary commodities, increased taxes, every now and then new taxes, mismanagement, corruption, communalism, lawlessness. That to me is much more important than else..
385 2018-04-18 02:10:44 Only solution is doubling or tripling of minimum daily / monthly wage . A marginal increase in essential commodities but OK.
386 2018-04-18 02:06:55 I dedicate noteban to late Phoolan devi who originally had this cashless life. We are now blessed with metals and Gujarat stones and commodities measured in USD.

388 2018-04-18 01:55:51 Interestingly, the Martin Act provides the NYAG with clearer authority, because it covers both securities and commodities.   No need for jockeying.
389 2018-04-18 01:32:47 I like to collect commodities 
390 2018-04-18 01:29:12 I mean there are plenty commodities in the world that can't be enjoyed by disabled people. it's definitely a shame. But i think by forcing these companies to do so will kill their business because it will no longer be economically feasible to run it.

394 2018-04-18 00:54:08 That which you tax you get less of. Tax investment in growth, and you get less of it. Tax stocks and the market goes Bear. Tax them enough, it crashes. 

There's ALWAYs somewhere else to put money. Metals, commodities, OTHER countries that don't tax stocks.
395 2018-04-18 00:53:43 No but you forget that major commodities like oil are priced in $, not the economy wrecker €. That is why $ is THE benchmark still.
396 2018-04-18 00:45:10 Hahaha His calls on shorting commodities are usually signs of going long!
397 2018-04-18 00:32:17 Dude. All this tension is creating a damn crazy jump in commodities.. tax-law juiced banks. flip phones are back. Even IBM is up on rev.
