2 2018-07-17 23:59:27 I wish @CNBCFastMoney would admit they have no idea how crypto markets work.
3 2018-07-17 23:59:15 Great advice @SatoshiLite ! I am amazed at the amount of misinformation in crypto twitter these days. If Anyone is working on blockchain voting Or Decentralized social Media platform you’re timing is impeccable.

9 2018-07-17 23:58:38 Thing is the trend has been bearish. 
10 2018-07-17 23:58:36 The analogy is based on the lack of centralised control of nature of crypto or foodstuff commodity. Viewed thru a token engineering lens the pork and the corn might even have inverse network effects and indeed consumption value, at some point up the curve. Back to drawing board!

12 2018-07-17 23:58:14 I get what your saying now that you specify a type humor instead of someone’s race. I was more or less just giving you a hard time. But one real question. You really don’t like Aziz?

38 2018-07-17 23:56:46 Stopped Tweeting about Crypto still getting hit up by Crypto-bots . Hey Crypto-bots can you please raise the price of Bitcoin to $150 K for me? How bout $1K for Litecoin?
39 2018-07-17 23:56:41 Just have a mex account strictly for bills
40 2018-07-17 23:56:37 Since every price move is unique, its analytical importance comes when compared to previous price behavior. #crypto
41 2018-07-17 23:56:34 A lot of crypto's hitting resistance, don't believe 'bull run' till we break
42 2018-07-17 23:56:18 Great looking concept for the project, and the team behind it looks great. I actually wrote an article on them to explain some of what they are doing. Feel free to check it out and see for yourself what youre missing out on!!
