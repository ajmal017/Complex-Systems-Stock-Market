47 2018-03-28 19:25:48 There are adult educated men and women in this country who actually believe that when we leave the European Union commodities such as food, clothing, oil, gas, beef etc will be cheaper for the average family.

60 2018-03-28 18:27:22 I hope people realize that commodities nothing but an instant yet extremely short lived gratification. When we purchase on a whim under the influence of other people, chances are we won't even care about those products a few weeks later.

68 2018-03-28 17:55:13 This is wrong.  The for-pay services also generally get your data.  Even old school magazine subscriptions were doing it long ago to the extent they could.  The problem isn't consumer expectations, it's corporate expectations to find new commodities and income streams.

120 2018-03-28 14:42:23 Isn't expert meta-analysis of the scientific data often more valuable than an individual farmer's limited view from their own farm? Also, I'm glad you don't like animals being treated like commodities. That's the primary main reason I object to the production of live-"stock".

122 2018-03-28 14:35:31 That’s just sad. Some deluded people out there who see people as commodities rather than human beings. 
123 2018-03-28 14:21:12 It's just taxpayers' money and consumers' money, but what price virtue signalling, being seen to be doing good?  There is vast amounts of recycling, to recover commodities that are cheaper to buy new, subsidised by taxpayers because the public thinks it is "doing good".

146 2018-03-28 12:37:33 Yes I also mentioned the underestimated trade with China due to informal trade. Regarding the commodities, i'll look into it !
147 2018-03-28 12:35:23 Thoughts on commodities with current volatility, do you think learning the process of Agriculture would be a benefit with current Trade War dynamic?
148 2018-03-28 12:34:48 Yes, good point. But China trade is (from what I hear) also biased, due to informal trade. And I think it might be important to look at the commodities traded: China and Turkey mostly export short-lived consumer goods.

164 2018-03-28 11:09:08 Sorry, but this makes no sense what he proposes. The US economy is not weak. The US is a first world country, unlike China. Goods manufacturing in the US are of better quality. China is quantity and less quality. All commodities are quoted in USD.

166 2018-03-28 11:00:03 So in this regard cryptos are a lot more like tulips than the commodities you listed. Unless payment apps are developed and provide enough of an improvement, eventually the rest of the world will lose interest and stop buying. Price will collapse.

233 2018-03-28 06:19:31 I'll be lazy and ask here since there seem to be so many bright minds around - how will other asset classes like commodities and indices be affected?
234 2018-03-28 06:11:45 Sir, Remove future & options contract if u want to benefited to farmers these contract didn't price increase of agri commodities. Farmers have delivery but didn't get benefits & traders get benefits which didn't have delivery. Ye kisan ka durbhagya hai.@PMOIndia

Bigger questions are the same that are affecting global markets, fiat & commodities... mostly geopolitical...
239 2018-03-28 05:22:53 Comparing pets to livestock doesn't add up. You can care for a companion without considering yourself it's owner and them your property. I do not own my children, I am their guardian. Livestock are commodities that are bred to live a brief existence for the pleasure of others.

245 2018-03-28 04:29:52 Price of commodities in Zim are ridiculous in supermarkets in comparison to the tuckshops in the ghetto where we buy smiling. Where is the government for the people when these people (including multinationals) are ripping us off?

Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are influenced by opinions when you reach DECISIONS, you will not succeed in any undertaking.
252 2018-03-28 03:27:33 Just saying you hated them now and in long term. And those games were hard fought missing Hassan. This team is built to make noise this season. And these guys are commodities. JJ is good
253 2018-03-28 03:05:52 1. Más allá del buen momento del Aguacate y el debate sobre la dependencia de Colombia con los Commodities de origen fósil, en lo que no se debe titubear es en la importancia del sector agropecuario para la seguridad alimentaria mundial, sobre todo, por el crecimiento poblacional

An european bank with huge bonds issuance based in Sydney can be a small sistemic catalyst within mainland europe
255 2018-03-28 02:58:19 Prison abolition, kick out bail bond industry and start treating humans like they have value. They aren’t commodities. And you don’t own them just because you have more money, power or influence. That’s the lie you tell yourself so you can sleep at night.
256 2018-03-28 02:53:22 Go look at commodities stock market, people lose money all the time!!! You only lose money if you sell when it’s below the value you purchased it for#Investing 101
257 2018-03-28 02:42:44 The story says The railways are reluctant to invest in oil because they think it will be a short term market. The reason the railways aren’t moving grain as well as shippers hoped is they under estimated total demand from all commodities early in crop year and weren’t prepared.
258 2018-03-28 02:36:25 El dólar cayó duramente hoy en Colombia, el precio más bajo en varios años. El peso colombiano salió fortalecido por el alza en los precios de los commodities.

260 2018-03-28 02:22:01 This world where non-disclosure agreements are used as weapons is so foreign to me.  What must it be like to live like that.  No actual friends, no partners just commodities to be used and silenced.
261 2018-03-28 02:20:31 The long term goal of crypto is to not evaluate it against USD, but for commodities to set their price for #bitcoin  / #litecoin.

    Maintain downward price forecast trajectory.
    Despite price peak-out, commodities should be flat to marginally higher YoY in the next financial year.
    Lack of growth capex to generate free cash and continue deleveraging.

267 2018-03-28 01:44:15 China's economic activity remained strong in the first quarter, with hiring close to a record high, but the outlook is cloudy as two key growth engines - property and commodities - show signs of cooling, a private survey showed on Wednesday.

269 2018-03-28 01:41:24 Es increíble que pensemos que la apertura de la "industria" del aguacate en Colombia va a ser la salvación para Colombia, o que nos va a relanzar a nivel internacional, cuando en esencia continúa siendo, lo mismo, mercados primarios (commodities)

271 2018-03-28 01:29:22 Therefore, you nail many spots day trading commodities with tight discipline on stops where many don't and thus no likes for you!!!
272 2018-03-28 01:20:32 2018 = commodities
273 2018-03-28 01:15:24 You should really consider a balanced portfolio with mixed assets in commodities leveraging stock futures against present losses with options for purchasing securities that forecast well within a market full of volatility.  I recommend Pumpkins.
274 2018-03-28 01:10:22 I'd like to make this reiteration in case some haven't noticed; I quite literally enjoy the life I've got, which is exactly why I am pro-gun. To defend my own life from those who are willing enough to take another life for the gain of materialistic commodities
275 2018-03-28 01:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.

277 2018-03-28 01:03:55 Representation needs to flow up from the base. Otherwise it's just politicians as commodities and voters as consumers. I'd rather have representation.
278 2018-03-28 00:56:28 Keep a close eye on conventional markets and commodities. You can sense there is a down turn just around the corner

284 2018-03-28 00:17:38 @ChrisDanielShow It’s a mobile smells trip, but anywhere that the Baker Commodities trailers are rolling around filled with the dead loss cows. Come August time, anytime you see that trailer with the “not for human consumption” and the cow legs hanging over the side...worst ever
