8 2018-05-01 23:58:29 You ever notice how when the Oil played games against Columbus and Toronto they seemed more heated than ones against the Canucks etc?
9 2018-05-01 23:58:20 Oh that. Well impaling and stabbing imagery really grosses me out so I don't think that's something I'm interested in 
10 2018-05-01 23:58:12 .Do you have a proposal for eating oil. 

Do you have a proposal for cleaning streams, lakes or rivers after a #fossilfuel industry has destroyed it. 

Do you care? Does anything matter except your ideology? 

SK has been doing real fine under the CONS right?
11 2018-05-01 23:58:01 So we all know that good old Bibi is working with Putin & Donald to get their hands on Iran`s Oil.
12 2018-05-01 23:57:49 I am fully aware of that. Releasing the oil reserves is something most economists disagree with, and it’s especially risky this time of the year with hurricane season starting a month from now.
13 2018-05-01 23:57:41 I usually stay away from pastels and white. I attract oil, spaghetti sauce, gravy etc, no matter what.
14 2018-05-01 23:57:24 Maybe trying to find a new way to ship oil in Canada other than  train. Oh ya, it's called a pipeline.

18 2018-05-01 23:56:05 you can start by living in a bark hut. throw everything out that relates to fossil fuels ie; oil. When thats done let the rest of us know and we'll see how you're getting on.

39 2018-05-01 23:55:40 As a chemist I can tell you unequivocally this simply is NOT true. Factors: choice of solvent, the salinity & temperature of the water, chemical makeup of the original bitumen ( huge factor), presence of emulsifiers... Only synthetic oil and a diluant might always be "the same".
40 2018-05-01 23:55:38 Good job kid. But u gave him too much room. U should call his bluff on Iran roits.,CIA propaganda.. there were a mere few hundred protesters.  Oil oil .... same ol interventionist BS.

49 2018-05-01 23:53:36 I can’t fuck with no weak mind. like oil and water we just don’t mix.
50 2018-05-01 23:53:31 I’m proficient in many things but being a car owner is not one of them. I drove at least a quart low on oil for 100 miles today. Thanks to my Click and Clack father @jerrywolford for walking me through a side of the road oil fill up.  #adultingFail
51 2018-05-01 23:53:22 What shampoo, conditioner, and oil do you use?
52 2018-05-01 23:53:08 I remember I told my grandmother I was afraid of hot oil & getting burned . she took my lil self right in the kitchen and made me fry plantains for everyone and  bake & saltfish . I was 9 ... got burned once and never again .

55 2018-05-01 23:52:32 It works the same way as oil and  gasoline inventories
56 2018-05-01 23:52:25 Actually it is the opposite. If dollar increase then the oil prices decrease because oil is priced in dollar and as the dollar surges, oil's  cost also surge for the consumers so they begin cutting consuming oil. At the end higher dollar  makes oil decreasing.
57 2018-05-01 23:52:15 I’m just gonna lather myself up in coconut oil and pretend you don’t exist

69 2018-05-01 23:50:10 So you’re saying the whole oil industry disappears without a pipeline? And a Vancouver terminus is the only solution?
70 2018-05-01 23:49:42 As to the misfire — I’ve not felt that. And for what it’s worth, I did spill some oil on the cover a while back, which could be the “leak” for all I know.

78 2018-05-01 23:48:58 RT @LeeCamp: It's simple. We used to have a monopoly on the oil trade. Iraq dropped our fiat currency and profited. Iran, Venezuela + Russia saw this + took steps to do the same. Our economic dominance was at risk. Today, millions have died in the name of a (part 1)

81 2018-05-01 23:48:26 Do you check the oil in your car?
82 2018-05-01 23:48:22 Internet! Is there a coffee creamer that doesn't have added sugar and shit like vegetable oil in it? That isn't fucking expensive as shit???
83 2018-05-01 23:47:55 The deal was, stop trying to develop nukes, we drop sanctions and allow Iran to offload 2 million barrels a day of oil, which would, of course, cause the price to collapse.

Guess who's the only party with an objection to that.
84 2018-05-01 23:47:42 Some kid real life hit me up on snap with a vid of a shit ton of coconut oil and was like 10 a pop, I was like tf imma need coconut oil for, he said idk since your all about being healthy figured you might want some good for hair, skin, cooking etc

Today they told her they will no longer sell to her because she did not use enough oil this past winter

I guess over 40 years of being a customer means nothing after one mild winter.

134 2018-05-01 23:41:06 See in Venezuela we can trace every socialist decision and show how it was flawed and led to an inability to produce even half the food which was being produced before appropriation, or a percentage of oil refined.

144 2018-05-01 23:40:04 Olive oil is the most disappearing ass thing in my kitchen, second only to spinach.
145 2018-05-01 23:40:00 Yes, it does!!! I still have one in 6th grade...the baby! But my one & only girl is in college!! Sheesh! How'd that happen?! Ha!
146 2018-05-01 23:39:52 The problem is that Trump is the swamp and through right wing media echo chambers has dupes you guys into thinking the opposite of reality. He filled his administration with wall street execs and bankers, big oil, big donors, and the gamut of swamp monsters. 1/2
147 2018-05-01 23:39:43 So, unless we plan on halting all production of oil, gas, diesel, ntrl gas, petrochems(most chemicals), & all rubbers/plastics, we're already doing our best.
Instant 3rd world status in the US to avoid an extra +6F in 2100?
Far more pressing & realistic issues to prioritize.
148 2018-05-01 23:39:34 Looks like it’ll buff out.....
149 2018-05-01 23:39:10 I've seen pictures of her on here lol. I think we're not terribly far from each other though.

153 2018-05-01 23:38:39 Oh NOW @secretaryzinke cares about defacing public lands? Ask him which is worse: graffiti on a stone monument that can be removed or an oil well or put mine in a wilderness area that’s there forever?

157 2018-05-01 23:37:58 Why? My money is on Murdoch, Dacre and Rothschild. They dictate every aspect of political events.

#Windrush is about racist votes
158 2018-05-01 23:37:50 Well, since you don't want a head of EPA, I guess we will just let the oil companies destroy the water and air. You are some kinda piece of work
159 2018-05-01 23:37:47 Ok no. Our biggest asset is not oil at all. The total energy sector doesnt even equal 10% of our GDP. The biggest Albertan asset may be oil, but one province is not all of Canada.
160 2018-05-01 23:37:33 I learned how to change my oil today :)

165 2018-05-01 23:36:24 Then we bring back whale oil.... Then buggies, AM radio, 8 track tapes ... Bring em all back

168 2018-05-01 23:36:00 "If Canada proceeds [with tar sands], and we do nothing, it will be game over for the climate." (James Hansen).. Oil and climate do NOT mix (period). Science and ecosystem health must prevail over ideology and greed. Sustainable economy is attainable now!

173 2018-05-01 23:35:45 They’re claiming a misfire on cylinder 1, caused by oil getting into the engine + a radiator leak. 1500.00 worth of work.
174 2018-05-01 23:35:19 If it’s a production based business why does Garrett still have a job? This isn’t a well run organization, it’s a family business selling snake oil to fans.  Someone needed to be the scapegoat and @DezBryant was the fall guy. Their ineptitude gets old.
175 2018-05-01 23:35:17 Oh, OK!  That’s where the Carpenters are from.  South Bay is Awesome!  Oil fields & refineries!  
176 2018-05-01 23:34:41 lmao I went to get an oil change and when I left, my oil light came on.. wanna know why? CAUSE THEY DIDNT FILL MY FUCKING OIL BACK UP ALL THE WAY.

181 2018-05-01 23:33:46 It tells me to keep focusing on the historical crude draws / fundamentals and anything that comes from Iran will simply be a bonus for #oil prices if sanctions are reinstated; of course, there is near term bearish potential here too if expectations are not fulfilled re Iran.
182 2018-05-01 23:33:37 Depends! In this case yes because I made rosemary olive oil first
183 2018-05-01 23:33:36 Yeppers! Snake oil & opioid $$ don't appeal to most people but the truth does, & Don Blankenship appears to be full of a lot of truths.

187 2018-05-01 23:32:52 I almost never put anything on my salad, and when I do, it isn’t dressing. (I use things like vinegar, oil, lemon, etc.)
188 2018-05-01 23:32:52 If you can’t kill a gram of oil by yourself in less than a day you weak boy
189 2018-05-01 23:32:42 O'Reilly Factor wasn't a news show, it was a soapbox. Snake oil salesmen used to stand on a soapbox to hock their wares. I had a higher opinion of him on #InsideEdition.
190 2018-05-01 23:32:25 Thanks @geoffreycann it Was wonderful to catch up and chat everything #oil&gas - you’re always insightful!
191 2018-05-01 23:32:22 High Oil prices, I mean prices remaining around the present range are in American interest. Trump normally is targeting your knee when he says he will hit your head.
192 2018-05-01 23:32:16 Exactly. Not everyone in the squad can be a 'starter', and you're not going to get 'world class' warming the bench every week unless they're on oil money - and I'm not sure we want players of that mindset anyway.

194 2018-05-01 23:32:05 I just get tired of seeing the same old stuff and like the one above where the guy said there was no proof it was in US hell it was on the news. BTW, I bailed early when I realized Trump was a snake oil salesman and it was going to be a  Show, I was right.
195 2018-05-01 23:31:55 I should get my oil changed but like...... traffic............
196 2018-05-01 23:31:41 I agree it’s not Kim fault and she gonna leave him in a few years. However, him being an environment where he is the only has added oil to the fire.
197 2018-05-01 23:31:41 Thats why you dont see cars that run on H2O. Oil companies took care of that guy.
198 2018-05-01 23:31:30 At least the goats do something useful. They crap out the fruit on those trees to make an exotic oil.
199 2018-05-01 23:31:17 I want to #LeaveItInTheGround so our kids have a shot at surviving in a warmed climate. That includes oil from the Middle East.

213 2018-05-01 23:29:43 Maybe you should ask them how they are coming on the magic project that transports oil without pipelines, trucks, or trains.
214 2018-05-01 23:29:36 I’ve been on both sides of that situation
215 2018-05-01 23:29:18 So...if BC gets no oil or gas from KM as is or if expanded, why not just hang a left at Burnaby & pipeline bitumen straight to Washington refineries? "Canada's oil" gets to market, no tankers...& the old KM pipeline could be used to pipe in gasoline from refineries in Edmonton.
216 2018-05-01 23:29:12 Y’all twitter people need to STOP acting like y’all always loved darkskin women and men. Now that they’re Trendy and are IN now y’all all fw them heavy. all you gotta do is oil up a darkskin girl or man and everybody loves them all of a sudden

218 2018-05-01 23:28:36 Joyce has any effort been made to look at establishing an oil refinery so that Alberta oil can be processed before being sent to tankers. I would think this would decrease risks of oil spills in ocean and increase profits

222 2018-05-01 23:28:18 It was the high cost of energy that started the recession in 2008. Oil is once again headed to $100 / barrel and Zoolander is going to fuel the collapse with hefty carbon taxes.

226 2018-05-01 23:27:49 I think a lot about that scene in Man Of Steel after he saves the oil rig workers and ends up in a nowhere town and it’s raining and Seasons by Chris Cornell is playing and Clark’s so lost, figuratively and literally. Like no M/C/U film quite captures this emotion.
227 2018-05-01 23:27:44 @szaman Hey Zman, which Oil ETF do you recommed to watch?  I like $WLL for the daily breakout today. Took a pull back and stopped out.  Really wild intraday swing.

232 2018-05-01 23:26:55 Ummmm nope! Now she’s cleaning anything and everything she can reach with a paper towel now that she’s checked the oil....while he is on the phone....still!!! Just FYI, and no bleeding hearts because before he pulled over to the air he walked out of the store with a bag.
233 2018-05-01 23:26:54 Just how the Pacers weren't supposed to force a seventh game.  Stick to play by play calling for the mighty oil.

238 2018-05-01 23:25:52 A hash, basically. I’ve got TJs chicken sausages and some frozen roasted veggies since TJs didn’t have the fresh veg I wanted. I’m going to throw them in a skillet with some oil, salt, and pepper and see how it goes!
239 2018-05-01 23:25:41 This doesn’t happen overnight, and is based on domestic vs exports here in USA. Petrochemicals here mostly are nat gas based, as oil moves higher, they can export resins more readily. That has not started happening yet as it’s still a buyers market on pvc/resins in USA.
240 2018-05-01 23:25:24 Tofu is soft nothing. It tastes like whatever you cook it with. You can literally make anything with it. I like using sesame oil, because it has a strong flavor. Baking it with olive oil and seasoning is super good too.

254 2018-05-01 23:24:03 In energy, we are buying stuff that’s economic at the well level in the $30-40 range, often in the Permian or Scoop shale plays, says $APO’s Josh Harrris. Also: We don’t think oil price can go below $50 for long. #MIGlobal
255 2018-05-01 23:24:02 Trump will pull out of the Iraq deal, sanctions will be reimposed. Oil prices will rise further. Couldn't come at a better time for APC - a lot more money to spend on the elections.
256 2018-05-01 23:23:32 I'll never understand this right-wing obsession with "job creation." They'll look over absolutely deplorable policies like minimum sentencing or repealing environmental standards in the coal and oil industries because it "makes jobs."

263 2018-05-01 23:22:27 Do you have a proposal to grow the oil industry without transporting our oil to buyers?

Alternatively, do you have a proposal to replace the oil industry without relying on profits and tax revenue from oil to do so?
264 2018-05-01 23:22:06 i'm getting an oil change because i'm an ADULT

267 2018-05-01 23:21:42 I guess my biggest issue with all this privilege talk is that most people pretend it's a winner takes all system.

That's not how privilege works. I had a Native American friend who was born part of a tribe that divides the money they make off of the oil on their land.

274 2018-05-01 23:20:50 Bay Bridge accident and oil spill now CLEARED. All lanes open, but significant slowdowns with traffic backed up to 280. SF City street approaches to the bridge remain at a crawl.
275 2018-05-01 23:20:50 Playing long game: when they got 40 acres and a mule, they were given salty ground. As in, salt dome ground. As in, oil, sweet bubbling crude.

Louisiana has black oil-field owners with as much drama as an Aaron Spelling show.

282 2018-05-01 23:20:16 Why is Oil/Gas still being subsidized? Why? When crude was $25 auto owners saved avg $750/yr@ pump. The climb back up has cost us dearly...almost like floating tax...& reported today that increased production in TX has only added abt 3500 more jobs.

-took oil money for his think tank but lied about it
-published book that legitimatized calling Israel apartheid
-gave a tepid apology yrs too late
-had factual lies thru bk so much that 1/2 his staff quit jobs
-Cozied w/Hamas during Bush harming US policy
284 2018-05-01 23:20:07 yes! I also regularly get things like "Director of Marketing for Giant Corporation" - like, I'm 2 years out of undergrad and can't even get my oil changed in time, but thank you ??
285 2018-05-01 23:19:36 Old man fracks billions in oil. Expects to know how to run sports team. How is that any more valid?
286 2018-05-01 23:19:21 IMO Iceland absolutely made the correct decision & other companies should follow suit. Even with the RSPO, there are issues with ‘sustainability’ as well as prelim studies linking Palm oil to health risks. Lastly, the industry needs to benefit the locals, not exploit them.

294 2018-05-01 23:18:40 Best way is to drizzle olive oil with fresh cracked pepper and roast it till done. You lose none of the good stuff and amplify the flavors

303 2018-05-01 23:16:51 I’d say it’s probably because of the low price of oil but those guys are so shady I’m sure they’d have the same problem even at $200 a barrel

305 2018-05-01 23:16:18 Hayhoe has a clear, vested interest in getting the facts right -- from a professional status, as well as by federal funding for her university (which requires no funny business by law) and state regulations (Texas is oil country). 

In the U.S., we prosecute scientists for fraud.

316 2018-05-01 23:15:24 Ya know, judging a person's ability to fix a tire or change the oil aren't great intelligence metrics. Lots of folks don't know how to shoe a horse or whittle wood either.

319 2018-05-01 23:15:14 % means that out of your bottle, 5% is made up of cannabis/hemp oil. But it doesn’t tell you how many mg of active CBD in there. It’s a pointless measure! How big is your bottle & does it state the mg amount?

335 2018-05-01 23:12:55 Dear cafes, 
You don't need to complicate Avocado Toast by adding any more than toasty bread, mashed avocado, salt, pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. It doesn't need pickled radish, pomegranate seeds or arugula, and maybe, $12 is a little steep?

YOUR SNP said oil revenues last year would realise between £6.7 - £7.9 BILLIONS.

It actually realised £100 MILLION.

384 2018-05-01 23:06:59 This makes sense, at $115 a barrel the price was $1.36, and now at $67 a barrel it’s $1.86. We’re not getting screw by oil companies and politicians what so ever. Nope.
385 2018-05-01 23:06:46 This is so aesthetic

To thank Americans they raise gas prices to the highest prices in 3 years. Expectations are gas will get to $4 this spring as oil companies will make biggest profits ever

394 2018-05-01 23:05:30 I guess OPEC and gas distributors didn’t pay attention to @realDonaldTrump comments about artificially raising oil prices!
395 2018-05-01 23:05:22 To be clear, Trump was a strong supporter of the Iraq War from the start and, for the most part, for the remainder of the war, as well. His primary criticisms to do with the Iraq War were that we didn't take Iraq's oil and that Obama presided over a reduction of troops in Iraq.

398 2018-05-01 23:05:20 If the cons get in (hopefully) the training will come from the private sector. And more probable than not, the oil industry. It’s not a secret that some of the largest oil companies are spending the most monies on energy technology beyond that of simply wind and solar power

402 2018-05-01 23:04:34 Yup, that's the way to do it. Otherwise, invest in some good cuts of meat, fish, etc. whatever protein you enjoy & do simple stuff, like grill, sauté, broil, bit of herbs, butter, olive oil. Then, a good rice and make a salad. You've covered the basics!

424 2018-05-01 23:02:18 Well, I did say that there is no trade war--it's a negotiating strategy.
I did point out the news that 40 African Nations signed a free trade agreement, consistent with my

425 2018-05-01 23:02:16 Not sure what they can do. As I understand it there are pending lawsuits, a court reference and an uneasy oil market. Western Canada Select (WCS), averaged US$35.53 a barrel in March 2018, 0.4% lower than it was a year earlier.

442 2018-05-01 23:00:30 in Canada, workers right, safe work conditions and environmental protection are key. Why does the federal government allow imports of oil from countries that do not uphold the same values, this is something I never understood
443 2018-05-01 23:00:25 Saw some 80 yr old dude at Wal-Mart with 6 bottles of olive oil in his cart and all I could think was how slim the odds were he could live long enough to use it all.

452 2018-05-01 22:59:40 I guess its a personal opinion thing pal. To me it's 99% Shitty fans, maybe coz we have destroyed them continously. They have something to celebrate coz they spent like 200 million on just their defence lol if i was their owner and spent all that oil I'd want the world cup!
453 2018-05-01 22:59:10 Whoopie do.Wonder how much he will bill taxpayers for a planned photo opt to help his image?I have no respect 4 a man who travel luxuriously on the taxpayers dime then promotes shrinking Grand Staircase-Escalante&Bears Ears for the oil&minerals instead preserving history&culture.
454 2018-05-01 22:58:54 Nooooooooo catfish oil 
455 2018-05-01 22:58:48 If oil is crap shut it down. An Indy scot doesn't need it. We have tourism, food & drink, wind & sea  Gas, financial services, technology, gaming, world renowned Universitie to name few. Yet yoons obsess on oil. Close it. We can reopen after Indy.
456 2018-05-01 22:58:35 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!

459 2018-05-01 22:58:25 You have to start somewhere, and knowing how strong the oil industry is, this is a good start that has support. I support Tulsi's efforts on this.
What is your solution?

477 2018-05-01 22:56:18 Possibly. I think it has a lot to do with the structural decline in oil prices, though sanctions by encouraging more self-sufficiency on the debt side, and thus tight fiscal policy likely added to it. Will be interesting to see 2018 trend and breakdown.

482 2018-05-01 22:55:20 if it wasnt apparent outside... the #coconutoilforecast will tell you.  in the valley, its pretty solid with a SLIGHT squish.  but the westside oil is all the way solid.

489 2018-05-01 22:54:05 Venezuela's collapse began in 2013. US sanctions (which were only applied to some of Maduro's cadre, and not on the whole country) didn't begin until 2017. And the US is still Venezuela's #1 oil buyer.

504 2018-05-01 22:52:16 Stossel fails to mention the economic war that has been waged against  Venezuela for over a decade. Waged because Venezuelan people refused to  be exploited by big oil any longer.  
Stossel doesn't mention this because he's a propagandist. #HandOffVenezuela
505 2018-05-01 22:52:04 Shoutout to @MurphyUSA for never paying me for my vacation time after I put in my two weeks and left. You're a notoriously wealthy oil company, but you couldn't pay me for my measly 25 hours of vacation time? Cool. I'll pass the word along. 
506 2018-05-01 22:51:59 Do you not know that the only *revenue* from oil is in the form of taxation? It is negligible because Swinney begged Osborne to slash tax.
507 2018-05-01 22:51:56 Nigeria is one of the countries Putin would somehow need to f*k in order to pump the oil prize up to avoid a bankruptcy of his kleptocracy.

545 2018-05-01 22:47:34 Or, say, the researcher who figures it out goes to Capitol Hill and the oil lobbyists' shill comes out and says "nah, son" and they believe him instead

560 2018-05-01 22:46:05 I don’t think I’m supposed to be shaving my legs with coconut oil.
561 2018-05-01 22:46:02 And coconut oil
562 2018-05-01 22:45:46 Scott #Pruitt IS the Devil, his "faith" is in #OIL MONEY, knowing HIS OWN GRANDCHILDREN WILL SUFFER FROM HIS POLICIES and he DOESN'T CARE! Car Companies can EASILY make the 36-MPG  by MAKING MORE HYBRIDS and ELECTRICS!
563 2018-05-01 22:45:41 I'd say these are puffed rice cakes. Bbung twigi implies rice cakes that are deep fried in oil instead of air-popped like these are
564 2018-05-01 22:45:19 Didn’t Derek just tell us all Sunday night he wasn’t going to be on Twitter much for like a month? Because I was looking forward to it.
565 2018-05-01 22:45:15 I believe I'm a pretty good judge of character, thanks for having great character and true compassion. Never give up the fight! There are some of us that know what snake oil is, and would rather not buy what the GOP is selling
566 2018-05-01 22:44:59 Because Trump's been saying shit like this for decades.  Threatens to sue, rarely does it.  And when he does, he loses.  He knows some secret that no one else knows?  Never gives up the goods.  He's a bullshitter, a flim-flammer, and a snake oil salesman.

570 2018-05-01 22:44:26 For now he stays because he is doing exactly what Trump wants. Destroying the EPA, ensuring progress with climate change is as remote as humanly possible, making T’s oil buddies extra happy.
571 2018-05-01 22:43:57 Tip number five: Stop buying Palm Oil. Every hour an area the size of 300 football fields filled with the African Oil palm tree is cut down, for palm oil production. #savetrees
572 2018-05-01 22:43:56 Grain needs to be going@on rail not oil!!

576 2018-05-01 22:43:38 its not quantity of accidents. its the cleanup and other soft costs which in turn = CO2 emissions. decarbonizing manufacture of cement is impossible. two fold factor; using oil to drive off the carbon...?
577 2018-05-01 22:43:34 It’s about oil. It’s always been.
578 2018-05-01 22:43:33 Are you doing coffee with fat (mct oil / grass fed butter) for breakfast & lunch
579 2018-05-01 22:43:31 Flowers and candy are nice, but dude you wanna give me a gift....how about detail my car, balance/rotate my tires, oil change...give me something I need #JustBeingHonest #CommunicationsKey 
580 2018-05-01 22:43:19 tbh I have no idea what went into the CSS faux-oil-portrait thing
581 2018-05-01 22:43:15 snake oil anyone?
582 2018-05-01 22:43:06 this is when you get when you got your hands in the oil companies cookie jar!
583 2018-05-01 22:43:04 And we are still talking oil.  How long can Nigeria exist under the current direction of the polity, economics & other social issues? We either wake-up to reality or drown in it. 2019 is too important to be played with.
584 2018-05-01 22:43:02 Do they have oil?

586 2018-05-01 22:42:30 I just love how triggered people get when you simply discuss how oil & natural gas companies protect the environment but reasonably advocate for regulation that actually has a basis in law. Kisses to all my fans!
587 2018-05-01 22:42:24 Calfrac revenue doubles as oil price rebound puts fracking crews back on job
588 2018-05-01 22:42:17 It’s dead as fuck I’m just hitting my oil pen in the kitchen. Two of the cooks have pens too and we just be casually vaping getting high its lit
589 2018-05-01 22:41:50 Bucky definitely ran and put product in his hair, did a face mask, and used beard oil when he heard that Steve was coming
590 2018-05-01 22:41:48 Cost of bauxite extraction and amount extracted vs that of crude oil will affect this. Not to mention the demand for aluminum is world wide for so many things already. Then we have to get into manufacturing costs and time  It's all so business oriented.
591 2018-05-01 22:41:40 The pipeline is to carry crude oil and bitumen you chud. Gasoline can’t be transported by pipeline
592 2018-05-01 22:41:30 Now he wants to be the word police,but can't see that oil and water don't mix.....,Priceless!
593 2018-05-01 22:40:38 Because Pruitt is an Oil and Gas shill and an #asshat
594 2018-05-01 22:40:37 BREAKING!! "Bill C-48 has just passed in parliament. After 40 years of work, there is now a moratorium on crude oil tankers on the north coast." ~ Pat Moss (one of Northwest BC's long-time conservation heroes)

597 2018-05-01 22:40:13 Yes because the war on Iraq was international matter and so is the price of oil these things influenced the international economics not only the UK.

601 2018-05-01 22:39:32 Of course! The entire western world were tearing each other apart in the early 20th century! They always have double standards!
 US politicians work for arms/oil industries not the people. Flint Michigan had no healthy water yet! Neither Obama nor Trump cared about them!
602 2018-05-01 22:39:09 I use lavender essential oil. Either in a diffuser or just a drop on my pillow. 
603 2018-05-01 22:38:40 #brunch Why is avocado allowed at the breakfast table and asparagus is not. And where is the fried egg renaissance . In oil , not sunny.
604 2018-05-01 22:38:08 The sulfur is naturally occurring in all crude oil, very difficult and not always necessary to entirely remove it from fuels. Since barium is so reactive it almost always occurs compounded with sulfur. The barium present may be the result of left-over sulfur.
605 2018-05-01 22:38:04 Can I be like the big short, short the Canadian Housing market? LOL. Real Estate, Oil, Increased Canadian dollar w/ rate hike. Who wins here?

619 2018-05-01 22:36:47 Nothing more than being held hostage over gas prices vs the environment. Hang in there BC , don't let Alberta or Trudeau push you around.All Canadians should only be paying 60 cents a litre for gas .We have our own oil in Canada. It's not just Alberta's oil. Greedy politicians.

623 2018-05-01 22:35:57 I hope you like sticking medical grade olive oil in your ear and then feeling it trickle out
624 2018-05-01 22:35:29 People defaulted, the banks have been unregulated for over 100 years, why things happened in 2008 after the Iraq war as the price of oil reached $147.
625 2018-05-01 22:35:29 @realDonaldTrump @Trumo shame to you for not telling the world what is going on in @Nizooria because is like you want your own biafran oil?

629 2018-05-01 22:34:45 As from Sept.3, 1939, till June 22, 1941, only Britain fought Germany while the agressor was fully supported by Russia in terms of strategic materials supplies, crop, oil, even passive milirary support.
630 2018-05-01 22:34:39 Really glad that the guy who changed my oil at @goodyear put a sticker on my car letting me know the miles my car had when I came in and not when I should get my oil changed in the future

637 2018-05-01 22:33:31 Trump likes Pruitt. He's carrying out Trump's mission to make oil & gas companies great &obscenely wealthy again. So what if there's a lotta fracking & polluting the environment -- hey, they're making the big bucks! And now they're indebted to Donald. Donald likes that.

641 2018-05-01 22:33:07 Hot take: the CSS faux-oil-portrait is no more impressive than any other medium, you just happen to vaguely understand how much work went into it for a change
642 2018-05-01 22:32:59 For a province like Alberta with expensive to produce oil, high gas prices are a feature, not a bug.

647 2018-05-01 22:32:26 cleaning tips suggest boiling a cup of water with some baking soda and white vinegar in the pan before seasoning it with oil but i can't find our white vinegar or baking soda (we have a big tub of bicarb tho)

660 2018-05-01 22:30:43 California is rife with them. They tend to give off highly flammable ribbons of bark, and the trunks, saturated in oil, explode in wildfires. Other than that, they cover your car in shit when you park under them. They smell nice, tho.

667 2018-05-01 22:30:24 Is it coconut oil
668 2018-05-01 22:30:17 It’s literally the only moisturizer that doesn’t make me an oil slick by mid day. Flawless under makeup too 
669 2018-05-01 22:30:11 Try Cannabis CBD oil...many opioid addicts overcame with it.

674 2018-05-01 22:29:46 Nice try, but needs more coconut oil.
675 2018-05-01 22:29:45 My 17 year old Toyota Camry passed the stupid state inspection. It’s the reason why I’m going to buy a newer Camry. Well built, and I’ve put less than 5000 into it over the years (except tires and oil changes)
676 2018-05-01 22:29:43 I tried those and liked the Olive Oil Kettle Chips better.  

Also, the new Cauliflower Stir-Fry is a great base. Just add some more veggies and aromatics to it. Throw in some  too and .

679 2018-05-01 22:28:37 There are reasons to cause international banking crisis and the reason was the price of oil gone up, businesses collapseed, people lost jobs they defaulted to pay loans and mortgages that led to banking collapse.

681 2018-05-01 22:28:01 Tonight’s bath oil was called DEEP RELAX (chose it over the one called LIGHT RELAX). I expect to be asleep in 5 mins or I’m emailing Watchdog.
682 2018-05-01 22:28:00 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, why are the crude oil prices going so high? We are still buying oil from the Arabs and our fuel prices are really going up. Check this stuff out will you? MAGA....
683 2018-05-01 22:27:59 Well actually forest fires and oil well fires are fought with fire.

Who needs to worry about facts when there is a liberal agenda afoot?
684 2018-05-01 22:27:57 Lol, I don't mind the preaching, it led me to try the hemp oil and turmeric, both fails.
It helps feed my helpless fantasise though, every cloud and all that 
685 2018-05-01 22:27:10 IT WAS REAL GOOD. All the toppings except the seaweed were sauted in sesame oil too before I added them in and hhnngnnggg  I need to start writing down my recipes lmao.... I never really use recipes or write my own down LOL...

Amazing to watch socialism destroy an oil rich country in a couple decades right before our eyes.

692 2018-05-01 22:26:41 If you ever tasted cbd oil vs hemp seed oil you'd recognize that anyone could tell the difference between them blindfolded.  CBD is a harsh, unpalatable flavour.  Even 25% in seed oil would make you cringe.
693 2018-05-01 22:26:39 We are among the biggest per capita contributors and quite deceptively outsource our oil sands emissions for product consumed elsewhere. We are also a country that can model sustainability and encourage others to follow. Most of world's top ranked countries are climate leaders.

701 2018-05-01 22:25:28 For the last few years the price of oil has been low. It's gone up a bit recently.
702 2018-05-01 22:25:24 it seems to be very popular to blend the shale condensate with heavy oil so it will meet pipeline viscosity spec

705 2018-05-01 22:24:35 That happened to me last week, my doctor had me roll it out w a tennis ball (against a wall is best). Also rubbing cbd oil helped too

707 2018-05-01 22:24:32 The price of oil is high and UK oil... at the moment.
708 2018-05-01 22:24:24 (( I've recently signed a petition for cannabis oil to be allowed to be used on prescription over here. It is for the treatment of a little boy who has severe epilepsy & apparently could really help him))
709 2018-05-01 22:24:06 Now I know with all that oil, @f3_dallas should be able to at least get some gas lamps for COT. #seriousgloom

713 2018-05-01 22:23:41 It's globalists like Hitlary&Obama that sought to destabilize the middle East. Libya was an oil producing country& khadafi shared the oil...
714 2018-05-01 22:23:33 Oh God no. Oil revenue is entirely dependent on the price of oil. And it is UK oil.
715 2018-05-01 22:23:30 Oddly I didn’t see any complaints when they played a full season together and Oil made the playoffs.

@realDonaldTrump is a reap off sneak oil sales man, he's proven it over and over, way to many times !
723 2018-05-01 22:22:16 I found lavender and peppermint oil work well for migraine. Especially on  the nape and temples. 
Yeah you'll win. Dietary changes can kick your body into gear... but not always guaranteed. 
I'm sure you've tried loads of stuff for it.... I'm not going to preach lol
724 2018-05-01 22:22:11 Oil.
725 2018-05-01 22:21:39 On their ballistics weapons program. Nothing related to original sanctions on oil, which is where Iranian economy heavily relies on.
726 2018-05-01 22:21:24 When you go in for an oil change and they tell you $300 dollars worth of other things need to be serviced  it’s fine. I’m fine. 
727 2018-05-01 22:21:15 When he is trying to bring investors from America to invest in agriculture PDP is still talking oil. Rubbish
728 2018-05-01 22:21:11 To my friends that don’t know much about their vehicle.
- Get an oil change every 3-5,000 miles depending on the oil you use
- Rotate your tires every- every other oil change to keep the wear on them even.
- don’t ask my why you need tires when they are balder then my dads head.
729 2018-05-01 22:21:10 He will never actually answer your question because he knows the real answer isn’t the snake oil he’s selling. He will ALWAYS spout out a Port excuse instead

734 2018-05-01 22:20:42 @ShutUP_andTweet Sounds like a good idea! Have you taken  care of the oil change?
735 2018-05-01 22:20:23 We've used oil to create a lot of hatred among ourselves. It's oil that's destroyed our structure that we're now calling for restructuring. It's better the president ignored it. It's not important because oil never needs so much advertising.
736 2018-05-01 22:20:09 Oil is good but it had not been in our interest to have it around. It's created so much corruption in our nation.
737 2018-05-01 22:20:09 Most people my age are in serious relationships and killin their current careers. I on the other hand accidentally ingested the smallest amount of tea tree oil, had a panic attack and called poison control crying. #justadayinthelife
738 2018-05-01 22:20:03 Let me tell you something that we Israelis have against Moses. He took us 40 years through the desert in order to bring us to the one spot in the Middle East that has no oil. - Golda Meir
739 2018-05-01 22:20:02 Exxon wants to destroy to our water. This is corporate greed over long-term health to our environment.  5 years for something that takes 10 years?  Sounds like a gamble. There has to be guidelines and 3rd party oversight to make sure they don't end up with more oil in our oceans.
740 2018-05-01 22:20:01 Took my hair out now I need to condition and oil treatment tonight

748 2018-05-01 22:19:10 I never realised that the staircase portraits were high resolution photographs. I naturally assumed they were oil paintings?

750 2018-05-01 22:19:01 Get some essential oil beadlets.  I've taken an On Guard one (several times per week) by Doterra Essential Oils the past two years. I've had way less colds & sore throats!

754 2018-05-01 22:18:01 Dynamite is used to extinguish oil well fires.

Also, fighting the Nazi war machine with our own war machine stopped WWII in Europe and two doses of atomic hellfire stopped the Japanese war machine.

It's really looking like fighting fire with fire is the BEST solution.
755 2018-05-01 22:17:58 Retweeted Ken (@KenSustainable):

I’m starting to see articles pop up about gas-saving tips now that oil prices are on the rise. Here are the tips that I never see included:
1. Ride a bike
2. Take mass transportation
3. Drive an electric car
756 2018-05-01 22:17:52 But why does LV trade him? They have solid depth throughout their line up and do have cap space to work with. Besides maybe picks what do the Oil have that they are willing to part with that LV wants?
757 2018-05-01 22:17:42 I think I’ve got the perfect curl cream/leave in conditioner/ castor oil combo to have my curls 
758 2018-05-01 22:17:37 Bikes and cars are both massively useful so why force one off the road? Only going to be a divisive move. Just wait for peak oil
759 2018-05-01 22:17:37 Has London (not the people) ever come to the aid of US for anything besides what they instigate from the shadows to control us & benefit themselves at our detriment (war, oil, finance, social, secret societies)? Like marriage to a gold-digger waiting for the Royal lubricant.
760 2018-05-01 22:17:29 Yeah but didn't you know the financial collapse happened when the price of oil got up to $147 in 2008, all because of the Iraq war.

768 2018-05-01 22:16:29 My car’s oil ran out (I think) when I was on the highway so I had to pull over and my sister took me where I need to go. My mom’s like “I have a feeling it’s going to a junk yard” and I’m looool don’t test me. If I don’t have a car I’ll drop everything. College, high school, job.

770 2018-05-01 22:16:06 TBH it’s weird how the skin works. The dry areas aren’t getting enough hydration but the areas that are oily aren’t getting enough either that’s why so much oil is produced. Try a water cream and only exfoliate 2-3x a week.
771 2018-05-01 22:15:49 Lol something else— I haven’t tried this yet and I plan to get some soon— but rosehip oil for acne scars
772 2018-05-01 22:15:45 Yeah, it's off.  Now, for the fun PT.  Hang in there.  Massage the incision with Palmer's Skin Therapy Oil if you have it there.  It is amazing.  The scar will disappear.  Be sure to massage a lot and firmly.  It will break up any forming scar tissue.
773 2018-05-01 22:15:37 I’m wireline in oil and gas and I pretty much call out everything... so yeah it’s possible

779 2018-05-01 22:14:53 You don't have to be a football genius to know that Zidane was playing mind games when he said La liga is more difficult than UCL. But because Roma forcefully romanced and raped you while Madrid progressed you now agree with Zidane.

782 2018-05-01 22:14:41 IT’S PAUL GREEK TO ME: When an airline snafu causes petroleum engineer Paul Loftin to land in Athens, Greece and not Athens, GA, this proud American soon discovers pressing olive oil is more of a thrill than drilling for crude oil. But what would the boys back home say? (17/100)
783 2018-05-01 22:14:40 The UN and the federal government has done very little to fix poverty on reserves, oil companies have put money and jobs in, yes there is a trade off. There is no such thing as a free lunch, but no other industry has stepped forward the way they have.
784 2018-05-01 22:14:40 That’s why I ain’t buying anymore oil pens 
785 2018-05-01 22:14:36 I got this super nice bottle of olive oil for $2.99 at the surplus store... I feel pretty fancy using it 
786 2018-05-01 22:14:35 It stops when there is no more oil, gas and coal being consumed in Canada. Even the Conservatives have bought into the Paris Accord.
787 2018-05-01 22:14:31 Don't forget to always use essential oil before, during, and after sex!
788 2018-05-01 22:14:30 You are an eejit of the highest order. That cut in revenue tax was to extend the oil fields while the industry put the technology in place. UK NO PLAN just reap the benefits and wasteful with pitiful reinvestment
789 2018-05-01 22:14:26 rent, oil change & dentist wow May wow i gotta be this grown for you ! 
790 2018-05-01 22:14:12 Lmfao you looked like a King before who just needed some oil lathered on your roots. Only if our women let our brothers know they don’t need to clip from their beautiful hair. Just enhance it. But women don’t even embrace what they were blessed with. Love your natural form 
791 2018-05-01 22:14:06 Gas tax has very little to do with the price of gas. The report I just showed you is a study by a top economist, interesting read, but the main point is this:
close to 80% of what we pay at the pump has is determined by the price of crude oil. #HandsOffSB1
792 2018-05-01 22:14:00 Nigeria must be careful you've got oil and US and oil are in the same whatsapp group, there will bomb you if they don't get what they want
793 2018-05-01 22:13:53 I brushed this on my cauliflower pizza crust before baking.. just adds that zing that olive oil doesn’t! I am loving my Wildtree!

801 2018-05-01 22:12:58 Kids: Be a better butter eater Light or lite butter sticks have very little real butter in them & are primarily made of hydrogenated oil w/yellow food coloring added. A little real fat like butter or olive oil makes u feel full far longer than fake butter so u want to eat less.

810 2018-05-01 22:11:45 I object. Nigeria found oil years after the white man left. And we're still a shit hole till today.... Our leaders are fat as fuck while the people suffer. So how does that have anything to do with colonialism?
811 2018-05-01 22:11:43 So I’ve been needing an oil change for like the past 3 months and I didn’t even realize my salesman gave me a coupon for a free one 
812 2018-05-01 22:11:41 And bee sticks and raw water and other snake oil
813 2018-05-01 22:11:40 See, the oil works wonders.
814 2018-05-01 22:11:33 unlike a barrel of oil, ounce of gold or even share of AMP, the intrinsic value of a house is not easily measured. ‘price paid’ is usually determined by the availability of credit & the moral turpitude displayed by brokers and lenders in extending it so readily. @ShaneOliverAMP

839 2018-05-01 22:07:39 Linda, maybe you can come visit and spend some of your time lobbying with the groups trying to make some change. It’s not a bad place — we just have too much oil money in power. We are trying.

843 2018-05-01 22:06:52 I have a coconut oil and tea tree oil mixture that I use sometimes that helps clear my break outs, don't know how it affects different skin types but I'm pretty sure I have combination skin
844 2018-05-01 22:06:40 I had never considered the CTax as the specific signal to other Canadians to get on board and say “ok they’re doing things the right way, they can expand the oil industry.” Sparse middle ground in the debate. Most in the oil/environment debate seem to have all or none views.
845 2018-05-01 22:06:15 昨日からずっと、oil dollarだったらマヤサーマンホークとアイリスロウで何を撮るかを考えていて楽しいです。TLに上がってたガーリーなガタカでも良いですが、サラウォーターズの荊の城かなあとか、それよりもなによりも、ガーリーな現代版ホームズだなあと思ったりもする。まやちゃんホームズでぜひ。

849 2018-05-01 22:05:46 Im not short yet... but that day is getting closer. No one is going to attack Iran and the Iranian oil can still be sold to China, India, etc.

852 2018-05-01 22:05:30 okay you guys I told myself as a finishing my MCAT present I would buy myself either a nintendo 3ds OR a switch but now I can't buy either because I have a $1400 oil leak to fix in my car but hypothetically if I were stupid and gonna buy one anyway, which
853 2018-05-01 22:05:27 Can an oil and gasser really call out  privilege 
854 2018-05-01 22:05:26 That makes more sense. Although he should probably oil it better, that machine makes some strange noises.
855 2018-05-01 22:05:24 $500 oil changes.  Don’t get a foreign. 
856 2018-05-01 22:05:03 Jit was typing an essay. I used my organic coconut oil lmao it ain't work too well cause jit kept stopping his work  I'd try it again tho. When my time reigns
857 2018-05-01 22:04:50 I believe he also has plans to build an EPA castle.  Complete with a moat and burning oil trebuchets where his house currently sits?
858 2018-05-01 22:04:49 if i was a chicken i hope someone would eat me in a nice curry but alternatively at least like in a pan with some olive oil and herbs in a nice salad frankly
859 2018-05-01 22:04:41 I cooked them with coconut oil and mixed it with chicken! 
860 2018-05-01 22:04:19 So, if that is the "result" why the huge drop before 1971? Actually most of the damage occurred during the gold standard. You have it backwards. Dropping #gold standard fueled economic growth and stability of $USD would've been better if not for two oil crises.
861 2018-05-01 22:04:16 My doctor told me I shouldn’t drink castor oil due to the fact I’ve had kidney stones and my kidneys aren’t normal which if I drink the oil I’ll get dehydrated too quickly and that can cause complications/:
862 2018-05-01 22:03:52 I think your maths missing the profits earned by the oil companies during NDA period. And it is well known fact that NDA government is for the corporate and not for the people. Well said.
863 2018-05-01 22:03:33 We are a backwards race. You do not live in Africa. I live in a nation where millions were killed for being a different tribe. I live in a nation where oil is ours but we still haven't made one single step towards progress thanks to greed and corruption
864 2018-05-01 22:03:20 Have faith in the OIL
865 2018-05-01 22:03:09 Sometimes I’m too lazy or running too late to put on lotion so I spray on oil sheen

867 2018-05-01 22:03:04 Alot of fried food is vegan. Oil is still oil.

Also, you'd be surprised how much junk food is vegan. Thin mints and oreos are vegan.

Overeating is also still a thing

869 2018-05-01 22:03:00 How ironic is it that Kanye West is preaching this "world love" message and touting Trump's name in the same breath. If that ain't water and oil tryna mix, I don't know what is.
870 2018-05-01 22:02:58 France and Germany want Iran's oil.

879 2018-05-01 22:02:25 Seriously important to distinguish between DilBit and other petroleum products. Even though the oil industry constantly includes DilBit in "heavy oil" statistics, it's a different product - it contains solids.
880 2018-05-01 22:02:18 Win July canola up A$0.23/t & EU rape down A$0.89. Mainly currency moves. Canola pressured by lower soyoil which is being pushed by a fall in crude oil.
881 2018-05-01 22:02:17 Funding not only did all that, but a slap in the face of Iranians, empowering an oppressive brutal regime that has basically enslaved them

884 2018-05-01 22:02:04 Maybe the Alberta Conservatives shouldn’t have sold off 80% of our oil to foreign interests, and we wouldn’t be in this position?
885 2018-05-01 22:01:49 That is VERY true, I guess I never thought about that
886 2018-05-01 22:01:41 And behind the forest is a big construction site where they are currently drilling for oil, they also created fences to avoid foxes and other animals getting hurt by the machines unintentionally. So there is plenty fencing
887 2018-05-01 22:01:37 Sounds perfect!

894 2018-05-01 22:00:35 Gotta say, I can't speak for salmon oil, but we gave our dog cod liver oil for his joints and his liver almost shut down. Had to put him on a no-fat diet forever, but before we figured it out we almost lost him.

...I have nothing but good things to say about leggings, though.
895 2018-05-01 22:00:35 It's curious that Iran are planning to join Putin's Eurasian Economic Union and some of those in the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) have turned away from the US Dollar. For instance China are now trading oil in yuan as they've dropped the petrodollar.

898 2018-05-01 22:00:17 @RealAlexJones's contributions to public life include flogging his super male vitality (overpriced bottles of iodine) to Katrina victims. He's a nasty snake oil sales rep who should be mocked and treated as a pariah.
899 2018-05-01 22:00:08 King David was not controlled.  He was busy and the oil fell.
900 2018-05-01 22:00:02 I'm in a really weird mood right now because I saw #InfinityWar today, and then got my oil change, and apparently everything in the world (including my newish car) is falling apart.
901 2018-05-01 22:00:02 And the GOP has "done nothing" about mass shootings. They've worked hard to make an already tough year for the campaign. Or pancake syrup. Or motor oil. You never could tell. #adeadheat

905 2018-05-01 21:59:50 I'm Nigerian. I live in Lagos. Oil was discovered after rhe white man left. We still haven't been able build good refineries for decades and import our own oil. explain how colonialism had an effect on this. We are our problem.That's all I'm saying. We need to own our shit.

907 2018-05-01 21:59:40 $APC - Achieved record divestiture-adjusted oil production of 367,000 barrels per day and increased their production mix to 57% while generating the highest per-barrel margins since 2014, when oil prices averaged more than $93 per barrel for WTI.
908 2018-05-01 21:59:29 An off the wall thing happened today, somebody called my husband to ask if he wanted to invest 80,000 dollars in a TX oil rig for a 400,000 return. 

I lmbo, we dont have that kind of cash. It was also a strange solicitation. If we invest in anything it will be green.

912 2018-05-01 21:58:48 Corruption is rife on every level now. Maybe you should take a trip to Basrah & see the squalor they live in when it produces more oil than the entire Emirates, than Kuwait.

916 2018-05-01 21:58:27 Don't tell me they going partition illigally the oil fields so Syria needs a loan which would be there complete down fall as they would have zero revenues. Endless theft and war crimes being committed

919 2018-05-01 21:58:01 Plus, you have to know how to put oil in your car, wiper fluid, how to change a tire, add fluid to the radiator and all that fun stuff. And you have to explain it step by step as if talking to an idiot.
920 2018-05-01 21:58:01 The Alberta PCs had NOTHING to show after 40 years of economic mismanagement - no savings, and no hope. Notley is turning it around finally. Alberta is leading Canada in both job creation and economic growth with low oil prices. These are #FACTS (and not the alternative kind!).

927 2018-05-01 21:57:01 EU regulations do NOT impose charges - that was a lie/misinterpretation; they say that where charges exist they must be based on usage and not delivery cost. A bit like you being charged for 500 litres of heating oil delivered, excluding any leaked en-route
928 2018-05-01 21:56:51 If you look at a $1 bill closely, you’ll see it’s covered in reptiles!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
929 2018-05-01 21:56:46 I'd say minimal oiling 
930 2018-05-01 21:56:37 And build an EPA castle complete with a moat and burning oil trebuchets where his house currently resides?

937 2018-05-01 21:55:18 The good new bus lanes and electric buses, bike ways, bus routes, T3 lanes, shorter paths to stations, more trains etc. will increasingly get more people using PT, walking or riding a bike. And we will have better health, less pollution and cut to our huge cost of imported oil
938 2018-05-01 21:55:09 
I must of missed the oil part.
939 2018-05-01 21:55:08 Go get a pedicure!!! Or drink some castor oil!! She will come right out! My mom did it with both of my little brothers!

Only 10,000 miles over due. No big deal. 

Still trying to convince myself that the money I’m about to spend on brakes will be worth it.

It’s not cheap living right and taking care of your responsibilities!

949 2018-05-01 21:54:08 The Saudi government has advanced knowledge of the 911 plot. It’d be a bigger deal, but the US and Saudi governments have covered it up, you know, because oil.
950 2018-05-01 21:54:06 Sourdough bread. Olive oil. And the seasoning together is amazing.
951 2018-05-01 21:53:55 So with an engine flush, oil change and high mileage Lucas additive the oil pressure is ~34psi compared to it having been ~18psi. But what could barely be heard before and what I thought was a very light lifter tap is definitely a bit more pronounced and probably a rod knock.
952 2018-05-01 21:53:45 Unfortunately, The plan for taking over Iran and controlling the oil there as well, was already decided back in the 90s. Back when PNAC decided that we need “another Pearl Harbor “. Sad that all of their plans are coming true. CIA, and MOSSAD control the world!!
953 2018-05-01 21:53:41 Thank you for this. I scanned it quick. I’ll read further about how to get certified palm oil. I’m hoping @MomsMeet will join in educating others on this.

956 2018-05-01 21:53:33 I agree. Let me clarify: I detest monopolies & oil industry. Renewables are the next step or humanity is done for. But  consider this:
in the bi-nopoly system, oil tends to remain cheaper, as one of them undercuts.
For the initial investment in renewables, oil cheap is the worst.
957 2018-05-01 21:53:02 Capitalism does not equal trade.

It equals private ownership of the means of productive, and the systematised theft of surplus value from workers.

You just described the largely state owned oil sector that created a $1trn soveriegn wealth fund. For the people. Not capitalists.

971 2018-05-01 21:50:48 Although to be fair, Alaska also receives shipments of oil that are then sent on to US refineries by tanker as well. It's a complicated and interconnected industry. Much bigger than a pipeline terminus in Burnaby.
972 2018-05-01 21:50:45 Fun fact of the day. The world will run out of oil in approx. 53yrs.

Apocalypse anyone?

975 2018-05-01 21:50:19 I keep hearing that. They took Africa's resources. That's pure bull. In Nigeria, we discovered oil after independence. And our nation still ain't better off because our leaders have decided to keep a chunk of the wealth to themselves.
976 2018-05-01 21:50:13 I’ve tried it before and it worked. Now, I’ve been using this shea body oil from VS (smells really good), but works just the same. Lot cheaper. Damn near same results.
977 2018-05-01 21:50:07 @JamesSkoufis @NYGovCuomo It has been 4 1/2 days of droning, whirring, & whining from the CPV/MVL site in Wawayanda. It is like living in a wind tunnel 1.5 miles from the site. 2 gas/oil turbines, 1 steam turbine, residents & consultants knew this would happen. Shut it down!
978 2018-05-01 21:49:58 It DID NOT GO BACK TO THE STATE?  Jesus. It now is just open to the Federal Gov't to lease to Oil and Gas companies for THEIR PROFIT.
How can you not KNOW this?  PFFFT.

Did you ask her out on a date?
986 2018-05-01 21:48:48 Ooh she's pretty. Still think oil is your best bet
987 2018-05-01 21:48:33 Haven’t tried coconut oil to cook, but grape seed oil is

Please can I ask you for a favor?
Can you send me ghc200 I’m paying back by next week. 

Paying me back by when my sister??

991 2018-05-01 21:48:16 who needs men when I can change my own oil
992 2018-05-01 21:48:12 Oil prices have fallen lately. We include this news for the benefit of gas stations, which otherwise wouldn't learn of it for six months.
993 2018-05-01 21:48:06 Haha unfortunately I think the oil companies have us by the proverbial balls

996 2018-05-01 21:47:26 Having my sister over for dinner tonight as a thank you for taking care of a few things while I'm in #Italy. Not sure if she's just being nice or if it's the wine and olive oil we promised her from #Tuscany 
997 2018-05-01 21:47:18 Its a fair over under. On olive oil and cheese alone
998 2018-05-01 21:47:10 $DWT API reports a build of 3.427M barrels of crude oil, for the week ending April 27 vs a build of 1.099M last week!

1002 2018-05-01 21:46:46 Outside Woodrow Wilson building? 
1003 2018-05-01 21:46:44 I'm getting more nauseated by the minute. The EPA granted a hardship waiver to an oil refinery? Coincidence? Not in a pig's eye! Just business as usual at the Trump Dump (his words to describe the WH, not mine).
1004 2018-05-01 21:46:28 any regular body oil like baby oil?
1005 2018-05-01 21:46:27 I'd like to see an all female oil rig too
1006 2018-05-01 21:46:17 Russia is worried EU will cave and US will put secondary sanctions on China and Russia - also worried Iran won't be able to afford arms deals with both China and Russia and oil could be sanctioned again.  Russia needs JCPOA in place
1007 2018-05-01 21:46:05 Put your fave highlighter in your fave body oil.
1008 2018-05-01 21:46:03 Go straight to eternal hell where you belong for wanting to steal oil through unjustified bloodshed. When you enter Hell the world will have one less psychopath to deal with.
1009 2018-05-01 21:46:02 If I go and get my car fixed because it has a dent, does that mean I'll also take my car to the body shop every time I need an oil change? Applying a solution to a unique situation to every situation and saying "this is why marginalized people should not be heard" is asinine.

Is it seemly for a School Board Member to be this partisan?  Ugh.
1013 2018-05-01 21:45:50 if you use coconut oil to take ur makeup off Pls block me!
1014 2018-05-01 21:45:48 My guess is that F-Series will not be at that level for much longer either, as oil prices and rates continue to rise this year, leading to a recession next year, Ford books heavy “restructuring” charges throughout 2018, and Tesla reveals Pickup by 1Q19. Pure guesses. Let’s see.
1015 2018-05-01 21:45:45 Its amazing. If it were not for hunters game populations would be down in many places, including Africa. Fishermen have caused the gulf coast sport fish populations to soar. Caribou populations & polar bears are at all time highs in oil fields in Alaska. Those that use, protect.
1016 2018-05-01 21:45:32 Anybody else remember the Cooking with Tezuka youtube videos? Because I do. And I think of them every time I look at extra virgin olive oil.
1017 2018-05-01 21:45:16 Oil cap is also known as the 710 cap!! (It looks like 710 upside down)! 
1018 2018-05-01 21:45:08 everytime i come to get my oil change they always wanna check otha shit change my oil so I can go.
1019 2018-05-01 21:44:39 Now if liberals would only speak out against Iran and support a bill on human rights violations. Oh right doing business with these terrorists and importing oil is more important because Canadian oil is soon to be regulated out of business. Wonder why imported oil gets a pass.
1020 2018-05-01 21:44:30 Hang on.  Are you actually happy with a £7m tax take on oil?

Really?
1021 2018-05-01 21:44:18 Gas is expensive everywhere. Already, it was most expensive while your #pcaa #ucp government was in power... during an oil boom in fact. #ableg #residentclown
1022 2018-05-01 21:44:08 One day when Saudi oil wells run dry your people will resort to stealing from religious pilgrims and being domestic workers in all the countries where people come to work from. Or maybe USA will invade your country for democracy.
1023 2018-05-01 21:44:05 I feel like bio oil fixes everything. Stretch marks? Bio oil. Scars? Bio oil. Depression? Bio oil. Horny? Bio oil. Ur man just cheated on you? Bio oil
1024 2018-05-01 21:44:02 Fun(?) fact: house centipedes eat spiders, if you are okay with them. If not, peopermint oil doesn’t chase them off.
1025 2018-05-01 21:43:55 @realDonaldTrump No more extra tax break money, going for gasoline high prices at the pump. Oil companies ripping us off again!!!
1026 2018-05-01 21:43:44 Anything to keep oil prices down. Let's talk medicine!!!

Why do we focus on bogus words at public gatherings when we can be practical about the change we seek? Vast mineral resources yet we stuck with OIL.

1061 2018-05-01 21:38:24 Baby oil.
1062 2018-05-01 21:38:22 moron, exports are lowest because oil is low.India exports lots of oil related products.

and "share of gdp" is really not a significant indicator. it just shows trend in economy is changing

1070 2018-05-01 21:36:40 Very unfortunate to stop an approved pipeline that Canada needs so it can get oil to tidewater!
1071 2018-05-01 21:36:33 Being screwed in the name of taking the so called high road of Carbon Pricing, is now a Canadian way of life, but the USA buy our oil at depressed prices because our Fed is weak on pipelines, and we empty our pockets into our gas tanks to earn a living.
1072 2018-05-01 21:36:27 He was definitely talking about actual slavery. Also, he's never once described these supposed "mental ideologies," which is redundant, by the way. Stop drinking the snake oil.
1073 2018-05-01 21:36:12 Lewandowski was in deep with the Russians. Ask him about repping Venezuela’s Citgo Oil at $35,000 per month last May when Venezuela defaulted on their Russian loans & Rosneft was going to take over.
1074 2018-05-01 21:36:10 Tbh fuck oil companies and fuck fracking. No amount of money will compensate for the damage you do to the planet and the communities living around fracking zones. Y’all some pieces of shit.

1077 2018-05-01 21:35:51 The @OntarioNDP have a costed plan. The @OntarioPCParty does not. After 40 years of conservative mismanagement Rachel Notley has turned Alberta around, and that province now leads Canada in economic growth and job creation even with oil at $60 oil. We should be so lucky. #onpoli
1078 2018-05-01 21:35:50 Good to see they both can laugh it off and in the end both are wanting the oil sector and the thousands of jobs to recover. Working together and not against each other.

1091 2018-05-01 21:34:10 US will, quite naturally, slice things up to where THEY'LLget OIL. BY WHAT RIGHT, RULE, LAW, or REGULATION does US "DECIDE" the "fate" of Syria?

• Petrol 93: From R14.23/L to R14.72/L
• Petrol 95: From R14.48/L to R14.97/L
• Diesel :R12.75/L to R13.34/L

Main reasons for this
1. R/$ exchange ( weaker rand)
2. Increase in the price of crude oil

1100 2018-05-01 21:32:41 I feel like a bum because I’m the exact opposite. I took my car in for an oil change after 9 months and the guy laughed at me because I’d only driven like 300 miles.

1105 2018-05-01 21:31:54 From what I've seen and understood through my vists to Iraq,Iran has quite an influence in post Daesh Iraq especially with the presence of shite govt and shite militias but since US controls the oil fields,things might get interesting.

1128 2018-05-01 21:28:44 I've asked him to walk me through it the next time I need an oil change. An oil change really should be idiot proof, but I'm not holding my breath that I won't somehow blow up my car. :p

1139 2018-05-01 21:27:18 For them its all about greed and self enrichment. They dont utilise their POWER to change peoples lives, they only use POWER by giving away blankets mealies, cooking oil, fishing for votes and coercive POWER to force people to do as they please. Useless leaders.

1173 2018-05-01 21:23:13 I try to but it was like n=6 and that’s dumb for an oil marketed as a brain supplement IMO so I leave a little room for anecdotal evidence if I think it might account for gaps in the studies
1174 2018-05-01 21:23:08 Poser 45 is SO shallow, weak, and emotionally immature that only the jokes HE makes are ok with him. If ANYONE says ANYTHING about any one of his partners in crime, tRUMP wants them boiled in oil & he runs to twitter &/or the press to try to fry them. The press keeps helping him.
1175 2018-05-01 21:23:00 It is made with beef tallow, but no drain cleaner!  Women have no " stinky parts", so I have no idea what you are talking about. We smell like flowers.  I wonder if oil does the same thing.  Skin can be cleansed with fragrant oils. I wonder if they cleanse us of Vit. D?
1176 2018-05-01 21:22:58 Hey hey! Unfortunately our sheets don't have the healing properties of eucalyptus oil, as they're made from the bark (and not the leaves). But that also means they're scentless and won't trigger anyone's allergies :-) so we think it's a fair trade-off. Thanks for your support!!
1177 2018-05-01 21:22:55 I Need An Oil Change ASAP!
1178 2018-05-01 21:22:54 Hmm. Kettle calling pot black, Mr. Kenney. What did you do to help get AB oil to tidewater during your time as MP? Nothing. You mentioned pipeline 5 times in the 9 years you were in Ottawa. This faux outrage doesn't play well with the smart people. Non-Friends of Science likes it

1186 2018-05-01 21:22:11 I agree. When API came out we saw a quick drop followed by a bigger back back. It's beyond obvious what the bulls have in mind tomorrow after an EIA drop. But we know what we know (what the wise elephant told us today) so they will fail. But it still angers me how sneaky they are
1187 2018-05-01 21:22:10 Also, what’s the difference our Arab oil money or your American oil money.
1188 2018-05-01 21:22:09 What I find interesting about Norway, they see the oil as an external asset to generate revenues, while using renewables to support internal energy requirements, at the same time  dealing with market fluctuations, oil is now $67 a barrel, WTI prices, more to invest again
1189 2018-05-01 21:21:57 Nothing says I want to be an American like a Honduran flag in one hand and a F@ck Trump sign in the other.
1190 2018-05-01 21:21:50 “Democrats would have brought in less oil and gas money than Republicans?”,  You don’t know that, no one does. If your standpoint is, “ND better off bcz of Republicans...?” You can’t answer that either because the two things didn’t happen. Ever hear of the Post Hoc fallacy?
1191 2018-05-01 21:21:43 I knowwwww. I just have to figure out a way to get more oil rubbed bronze into the kitchen then because the faucet can't be the only thing ORB in the whole design, you know?

1208 2018-05-01 21:19:08 It would be easier to exploit our oil reserves if it were processed and distributed by Canadian owned companies no? Why should the profits be given to large multinational corporations? Sure we get fees, but we also have limited investment.
1209 2018-05-01 21:19:06 I’m in the same boat. Living paycheck to paycheck in the North where everything costs more. Invest in clean tech? Like what? Solar? The suns only out 4 hours a day in the coldest month here. Give me clean tech that won’t break me financially until then I need heating oil.
1210 2018-05-01 21:19:01 @StephenMoore What good are the tax cuts when oil prices keep going up. My spouse drives more than 55K /year. This eats up all the savings we would get from the tax cuts.     MK

1221 2018-05-01 21:17:11 You act like you are for the people, but, who pays you? The more i read, the more it looks like you are in the pocket of the oil industry. So, your predictions are not based on unbiased information. It's supplied info to test the acceptance of the market. You're pro oil n gas.

1224 2018-05-01 21:16:52 Really? It just seems that investing in oil, coal and other corupt and environmentally unsound companies is a contradiction to what she says she stands for. She could have contributed and invested in things sje says she stands for. So yes - hypocrite

1230 2018-05-01 21:16:09 @Varneyco Please help me to understand why, if Pres. Trump has unleashed our oil reserves,  are oil prices going up and thus gasoline prices. My husband drives 55K miles per year. This hits us really hard.      MK in Indiana
1231 2018-05-01 21:16:03 Timothy was surprised by the sheer amount of ass in his face so suddenly, but he enjoyed it all. He moved away a bit, and grabbed onto the bottle of oil before covering his palms.

1234 2018-05-01 21:15:37 I have to start changing my own oil and doing basic car maintenance again.  Quite emasculating to have a mechanic show me the dipstick and ask me how the oil looks.  You could have just dipped it in chocolate syrup and I would have nodded "looks great".

1277 2018-05-01 21:09:36 Remind me, why was Iraq invaded? Last time I checked it was geopolitical strategic interests in the region and oil, to fill the filthy pockets of those who made the decision to invade.  Not to mention those starving all across the globe and Africa due to poverty.
1278 2018-05-01 21:09:34 There are no verses in the Quran that promote those things if you read the verses in context.

The root of the problem is Saudi Arabia who has been funding extremism since the 1930s when oil was discovered in Saudi Arabia. Theyr're using the oil money to spread extremism.

1364 2018-05-01 20:59:12 Look to make sure shampoo and conditioner are sulfate and parabene free those ingredients will damage your hair more and dry it out, invest in a good hair mask and leave in conditioner! I stick to loc method leave in conditioner, oil, and cream!
1365 2018-05-01 20:59:01 Use butter or olive oil to grease the doors.
1366 2018-05-01 20:58:47 Hitch always wins.
1367 2018-05-01 20:58:36 seriously so sick of these oil field workers thinking it’s okay to cat call every girl they see.
1368 2018-05-01 20:58:33 Oil should be cheap . 2nd most abundant liquid after water . Its natural . Why is it so expensive?? It replenish itself. Oil is ABUNDANT stop exploiting human over it.
1369 2018-05-01 20:58:23 It's a national issue not just a northern problem.
1370 2018-05-01 20:58:06 Sell a freshman some olive oil and tell em it’s a bottle of tequila they probably won’t know the difference
1371 2018-05-01 20:58:04 HOW has this benefited the citizens more oil higher gas prices, makes no sense also why is a billionaire asking and getting help with his debts to run his refinery to make him more money he is pleading hardship to TRUMP and Congress
1372 2018-05-01 20:58:03 Can’t believe my car literally just started pissing out oil 
1373 2018-05-01 20:58:02 So you think it is acceptable to do paid promotions saying “we’ve found oil” along with a link of how to send you $$ monthly?

Tweet wasn’t deleted.  I just added your new friends @muddywatersre & @blalpert.  I would hate for them to miss the fun.

Also adding @BagholderQuotes
1374 2018-05-01 20:58:01 In the 70's they were saying we only had 12 more years of fossil fuels left then there would be no more oil. Then in the nineties they said there would be no more oil by 2010. I'm willing to bet chocolate will still be around in 2040.

1376 2018-05-01 20:57:50 The second in the world for having the most oil and we are being ripped off at the pumps and losing the benefits of this valuable resource. Hi's looking for a UN job I'm sure that what his plans are.

1378 2018-05-01 20:57:35 Oil change, headlight, and gas bless up
1379 2018-05-01 20:57:32 Under Obama, the dynamic was the Saudis helping us keep Russia down. If oil is <$55/barrel it’s not profitable for them. Kerry negotiated that on the QT in Sept 2014.
1380 2018-05-01 20:57:29 I really don’t feel like getting my oil changed 
1381 2018-05-01 20:57:16 Try a 2% dilution of essential oil of mandarin in a plain, unscented body lotion.

1384 2018-05-01 20:56:55 The output from the diff is made of tougher stuff, so it's fine. I flushed it all out with gear oil. The spline got rekt though when it misfired. I changed the distributor and she purrs like a kitten and the check engine light is gone.

1386 2018-05-01 20:56:53 yes, and I see the evolution going back to climate change denial during W Bush-Cheney when the oil lobby wanted to avoid any responsibility.... Then slowly GOP learned that they CAN deny reality and deny facts, if they just remain consistent in the alternate propaganda :-)
1387 2018-05-01 20:56:51 No, Liberals are saying Harper did not build any tidal water pipelines, which he did not. He did build other pipelines as well as give billions in subsidies to oil companies. That is the difference, tidal water pipelines.

1398 2018-05-01 20:55:31 A3. I love sole or cod. Grilled with spices and olive oil. Grew up eating fried catfish and red snapper. My mom and grandma always made it. #PantryChat
1399 2018-05-01 20:55:26 I cut the blocks into narrow rectangles, let them drain in paper towels under a plate during the day, and put them in hot oil in a skillet with just a season of salt on each side. Flip when you see the golden brown halfway up each piece. I eat them like chips! 
1400 2018-05-01 20:55:20 I look forward to seeing all you in our matching rompers. make sure you got gold body oil on your titties and shoulders to really set it off.
1401 2018-05-01 20:55:19 Can an oil co "clean up its climate act?" 
Serious climate action would render their reserves worthless.  Can they do that and survive?  Serious question.  @PriceofOil

1405 2018-05-01 20:54:33 This is similar to my recipe, but I use coconut oil in place of the butter & I add 1/3 c crushed walnuts & top with a sprinkle of sea salt.
1406 2018-05-01 20:54:20 Oh i am sceptical too, but not to the point that i will pass judgement in May on a guy who won't don the Oil drop until September. Lots to like in his resume but a big gaping hole where the NHL should be. As @oilvoice37 always said, "time will tell" 
1407 2018-05-01 20:54:14 Eyeee can't. I refuse. Get the anointing oil ready.

1410 2018-05-01 20:53:56 Hardworking contractors , from all walks , NHS , BBC ,Oil , IT deserve justice. HMRC has known for years about these problems and done nothing. They have done nothing and are complicit with the accountants and umbrella companies that have benefited
1411 2018-05-01 20:53:53 Of course.  I'm looking at 2016 numbers.  When oil was at its low.  And the GDP for the oil sector was 17%.  Second place is 12% (real estate.)

1415 2018-05-01 20:53:14 No.  This is all on JT.  The damage and investment loss already in the $100B ballpark.   LIBs had to work hard to cause this much damage to the Canadian economy and to the Canadian oil and gas business.    This is all on PMJT.
1416 2018-05-01 20:53:13 “My meal often consisted of tuna, olive oil and loaf of bread or ‘couscous’ soup when there is no harissa & black olives. So my way of living is not too complicated, in fact I kept a simple life, but I maintained a good health, a loving spirit & pleased with the daily progress.”

1420 2018-05-01 20:52:43 Thanks Coach! When we unloaded the crew said.....hey the last flight said they smelled burning oil and the loud screach and clunking sound. We will report it again. Needless to say I cant imagine booking with @Allegiant again until I hear of a change!
1421 2018-05-01 20:52:40 Venezuela should be In a much better position financially and economically with all that oil reserve they have
1422 2018-05-01 20:52:29 Bathing in baby oil is heavenly
1423 2018-05-01 20:52:27 I’m gonna be soo pissed if the BLM allows the oil field to be soo close to the caverns.
1424 2018-05-01 20:52:13 How do you know if your car need a oil change?
1425 2018-05-01 20:52:01 I agree. But-aside the likely sanctions on Iran-, a dependent variable, which holds big potential to impact both oil markets & oil price, is still the OPEC-non-OPEC deal on output cuts: ie: would it be prolonged bey 2018, would the Saudis & Russians agree on further/deeper cuts?

1428 2018-05-01 20:51:07 Plenty of work in the solar and wind industries for the oil and gas people that become unemployed. No one wants them to be without a job, but we also don’t want their/our children to inherit a plan that can no longer sustain them.
1429 2018-05-01 20:50:56 I hate getting my oil changed these guys just say a bunch of shit to me and I be like idk wtf ur saying just change the oil

1431 2018-05-01 20:50:47 @CorbinHamm54 Corbin get your brother on CBD oil immediately. It will kill the cancer. I realize I didn’t have cancer as bad as your brother but when they went in to take part of my kidney out I didn’t have any sign of cancer after using the oil for-six weeks. Cancer was gone
1432 2018-05-01 20:50:39 did it! I also there an oil up with

1434 2018-05-01 20:50:30 When measured by employment.   Because health care and education employ an incredible amount of people.  But for GDP, oil and gas accounts for 50% more than the industry in second place.

Better air quality,fuel economy, efficient appliances, promotion of LED lights,safe drinking water,&oil spill prevention programs resulted.

However, in 2017 Trump proposed a 31% budget cut to the EPA.

2) video filmed feb 24th.. OLD snake skin oil
1450 2018-05-01 20:48:51 That's a safer solution than trying to liquefy it. People incorrectly think bitumen is like any other oil but more viscous. Actually the heating process causes pockets of gas which can make transport hazardous.
1451 2018-05-01 20:48:51 He a hand in it but I think you'll find out eventually that China read kim-Jong loon the riot act and told him to knock the shit off or China would turn off the oil and cash plus trade goods spigot.

1456 2018-05-01 20:48:20 putting out oil fires with explosions seems pretty cool
1457 2018-05-01 20:48:12 Using Alberta’s own data, oil & gas was the 7th largest econ sector when measured by employment (in a category that includes forestry, mining and hunting). So far from the largest econ sector in that sense. 3/
1458 2018-05-01 20:48:02 The company I work for alone added hundreds of jobs as the oil industry boomed since 2008.  Then lost over a hundred in 2015.

1461 2018-05-01 20:47:50 Better to look like oil...
1462 2018-05-01 20:47:43 Worth noting: in many parts of the world prices for NG are indexed to oil prices; so supply side of assoc. gas is less important. With increased LNG consumption, we might see global spot prices. But, for now, the relationship of oil and NG prices is still location dependent

1471 2018-05-01 20:45:41 No, no, no. Gas and other fuel comes *from* refineries. So, you don’t need to import any oil to it if you have one. 

Also, they’re totally economical, easy to build, and there are no safety or environmental concerns with them.
1472 2018-05-01 20:45:38 Just paid rent, my car payment, credit card, and PG&E.... and I’m like cool i got a little til the 10th then I realize my tanks on E and I need an oil change

1479 2018-05-01 20:44:13 My recommendation is lavender oil. I think that will probably work best for your nerves. You can try @doterra because they are my favorite. I put a little bit on my wrist each night, as well as add a few drops to a diffuser. Also consider CBD oil.

1482 2018-05-01 20:43:35 I definitely need to get an oil change before I drive my car to Canada.
1483 2018-05-01 20:43:32 Hopefully the grown men that just changed the oil in my car enjoy one direction. Because I definitely had my Four CD in and playing on volume 25. I expect a thank you when they return my keys to me
1484 2018-05-01 20:43:24 That would rely on Iran trusting the West, Israel, Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. All of which are in a huge oil war for marketshare.

1497 2018-05-01 20:42:08 Alberta had the heritage fund that was from the oil royalties and spent it.  It could have been invested, or used to fund a diversied economic base but did not. Cannot ignore the fact that fossil fuels are bad for environment and need to move to other sources of jobs and income
1498 2018-05-01 20:42:03 Peppermint oil on the temples. Any oils you research and use should be applied to the lower back skull above the neck. Best location for vertigo. 
Cold ice packs on the head can help. Ginger helps with nausea. Chamomile is good to drink. So is Meadowsweet.

1516 2018-05-01 20:40:29 I'm not saying she's tricked into something. I'd say the same thing about a used car salesman, a snake oil salesman, or a Democrat telling me how they can solve the problems of the black community if I come over. Honestly it's not really a 1 side against the other thing here.

1525 2018-05-01 20:39:44 I believe the number of unemployed individuals in Alberta increased by 37,000 or so in 2016 (measured Y-O-Y ). And that would be for all econ sectors (yes, I know that oil & gas employment has ripple effects on other sectors). 2/

1541 2018-05-01 20:38:06 I've had an idea for a film.

Tom Hardy and Idris Elba take their shirts off and have a fight in some oil and then... Well actually that's it, they don't even have to fight but being shirtless is integral to the script.

1544 2018-05-01 20:37:43 There’s no doubt it’s important but the impact on employment of a worldwide fall in oil prices (which haven’t been as low as $30 since 1999 according to StatsCan) isn’t necessarily a good indicator of the number of jobs that might be created from investments in a sector. 1/
1545 2018-05-01 20:37:36 I agree with you, Jamal. Snyder's Superman is self-selving.

1568 2018-05-01 20:35:11 I find when my skin starts getting more oily, it’s because I’m not moisturizing enough. Typically the skin will try to help create more moisture via oil. 

As far as makeup products, I use to use Urban Decays all-nighter as a setting spray, and it would help keep my face matte.

1642 2018-05-01 20:26:04 Oooh thanks so much always hear coconut oil
1643 2018-05-01 20:26:00 Anadarko: Raised oil production mix to 57%. Highest per-barrel margins since 2014, when WTI was $93 per barrel. $APC

1651 2018-05-01 20:24:54 Gov&#39;t urged: &#39;Step into light&#39; on oil exploration...
1652 2018-05-01 20:24:48 @douglasbing this is disingenuous, how many times did gas reach new highs under a liberal gov? Was that the fault of the libs? No, it’s oil companies gouging.
1653 2018-05-01 20:24:44 You might be on to something. If I understand right though, the Libs were going to impose stricter rules on Cdn oil for Energy East than the imported oil. It forced the oil Co. to cancel the project. Go figure.
1654 2018-05-01 20:24:41 I think it's an oil industry astroturfing campaign.
1655 2018-05-01 20:24:41 From filthy rich farmers to oil money = R.I.P football :(
1656 2018-05-01 20:24:30 Need to give them independence. 10 yrs ago would have gladly taken it. Stupid politics has saddled us with them forever.
1657 2018-05-01 20:24:21 Easy on the palm oil oo
1658 2018-05-01 20:23:50 Just want to wish a giant may day middle finger to all the labour unions who fight against pipelines, fracing and oil sands development. Maybe spitting on your blue collar roots isn't the best idea.
1659 2018-05-01 20:23:41 Is it you that had all those Tankers laying off the East coast? Getting in my way and sitting there for months on end? Up to 90 of them a few years ago. Making money while the oil was bought and sold many times within their tanks.
1660 2018-05-01 20:23:32 Need to find a good place for a Oil change in Toledo tomorrow.
1661 2018-05-01 20:23:29 Do they pay tax or are they getting another refund from Westminster to cover the heavy losses they make taking the oil out of the ground.
1662 2018-05-01 20:23:03 Free oil changes in the future! Get those digits!
1663 2018-05-01 20:23:02 I'm told the Alberta Freedom Alliance, which is part of the Western Freedom Alliance umbrella (as is the NFA), is a secessionist movement that wants to take Canada's oil out of the hands of the greedy Ottawa government.
1664 2018-05-01 20:23:00 A US/Russia/Saudi co-op would control a good amount of the world's oil supply, wouldn't it? And would explain the administration's bending over backwards to hamper alt-energy and keep fossil fuels dominant.

1667 2018-05-01 20:22:47 $DVN  Two massive Boundary Raider wells that achieved a combined 24-hour initial production rate of approximately 24,000 Boe per day (80 percent oil). These are the highest-rate wells brought online in the history of the Delaware Basin.
1668 2018-05-01 20:22:10 Surely. This show is like, Tim Roth is an English guy being a cop in Canada, & the tiny town trying to fight the big new oil refinery but then it gets messy bc scary evil big business & dark secrets & someone gets murdered etc
1669 2018-05-01 20:22:09 It’s a common misconception that those with an oily skin should avoid moisturers - a correct moisturiser or oil blend can help balance oil production 
1670 2018-05-01 20:21:31 A day off after a hectic couple of weeks. Finally got down town to find a couple of hard-to-get oil seals for the Jeep's pto unit.

1673 2018-05-01 20:21:12 Much is. They are sitting on porches waiting for you to fund and complete it.
1674 2018-05-01 20:20:42 Why is it that whenever I bring my car in for an oil change, I get a list and a $500+ estimate of “here are all the things wrong with your car!”... Like I did not ask you to do a full car eval; I asked you to do an OIL CHANGE *end rant*

1677 2018-05-01 20:20:10 Did you see the Dukes of Hazzard General Lee at The Oil Can Café at Hepworth? It was 4 years or so ago when I saw it but I can tweet you a photo ;)
1678 2018-05-01 20:19:40 working on my Facebook dating profile.

1679 2018-05-01 20:19:37 @MehboobaMufti plz interfere into the matter of NT exam it's same like CET scam of 2010 even in some centers papers were missing before exam we have burnt our mid night oil to qualify this exam but this paper leak scam turned us down
1680 2018-05-01 20:19:32 Just had a guy AND a girl that work at toyota come up to me asking for my number while I’m waiting for to get my oil change ya dig 
1681 2018-05-01 20:19:25 Honestly waiting for my car to get it’s oil changed and tires rotated seem like the longest thing ever.
1682 2018-05-01 20:19:14 I noticed particularities like this take place soon before there is a backlash from prior faux-pas. (Often women find themselves in this scenario). eg: BP hiring a black female spokesperson after the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

1685 2018-05-01 20:18:56 Four decades ago in the Netherlands, people decided that they didn't want their kids to be killed by drivers any more. They demanded that streets be given back to people. The oil crisis helped suppress demand for driving. Now Dutch kids are the happiest and healthiest in Europe.
1686 2018-05-01 20:18:47 Waiting 30 minutes for an oil change? No problem. The dude next to me who has taken four phone calls with his ringer set on the highest volume? That’s a little annoying. “The office won’t leave me alone”. I hope you stub your toe on a steel chair in the middle of the night...
1687 2018-05-01 20:18:40 Getting my oil changed. 2 hour wait. AMA.
1688 2018-05-01 20:18:37 garlic, pepper and oil!
1689 2018-05-01 20:18:25 And you really, actually think spending all of your provinces oil and gas revenue (that resource NEVER comes back) on low taxes vs savings was a good idea?
1690 2018-05-01 20:18:07 Thank you, that's very kind of you.
1691 2018-05-01 20:18:02 I work in oil and shipping. As a result I get the fun job of trying to figure out how much each country needs in ship bunkering fuel, which is really trade.
1692 2018-05-01 20:17:55 They will not be able to fix War...which inches closer and closer everyday with Iran. Saudis need oil at $100 per barrel...as Gerald Celente says: “When all else fails they take you to war”
1693 2018-05-01 20:17:42 Coconut oil trash for that. I want to have dropped .
1694 2018-05-01 20:17:40 Maybe people figuring out how much money the save driving their car a few more years. Timely oil changes and maintenence is a whole lot cheaper.
1695 2018-05-01 20:17:40 The Waverly one is my favorite and super jealous of your oil painting skills.
1696 2018-05-01 20:17:30 I showed somebody the Coconut Oil Shawty video and they said they had already saw the video but didn't realize it was me so I must be a catfish
1697 2018-05-01 20:17:19 Good to see so many vehicle starting to run off of natural gas does make you wonder why the oil wells burn it off instead of collecting it

1701 2018-05-01 20:16:59 I made the decision to lay in the sun for 4 hours with coconut oil... ask me how that went
1702 2018-05-01 20:16:55 Assuming you meant pale in comparison...but check your facts: yearly oil and gas subsidies by Alberta are $1.1Billion...renewables subsidies are $10Million. That's 100 times less.
1703 2018-05-01 20:16:41 Didn't say that..just stating the fact that whatever the government gives, is ALWAYS takes away in some other way. The U.S. is exporting record amounts of oil these days... why are gas prices increasing here?
1704 2018-05-01 20:16:40 US Closing prices: #DOW -0.28% #NASDAQ 1.16% #Ftse100 0.15% #GBPUSD 1.3612 #EURGBP 0.881 #EURUSD 1.1993 #Gold -0.10% #Oil 0.26%
1705 2018-05-01 20:16:38 Sick. You mean those that follow 44.25's LIES are actually sick. Conned conned yup conned by the snake oil salesman in the WH.
1706 2018-05-01 20:16:38 Yes indeed. The level design is awesome. You can also push a set of spikes in the Mania version of FB in act1 to reveal a secret area (note that the spikes you can push in the Mania version are in a different location). Same applies for Oil Ocean act1 in Mania.
1707 2018-05-01 20:16:34 Just a reminder that tea tree oil can kill cats and dogs!!

1710 2018-05-01 20:16:15 I think he has no idea that coal and oil and gas are plentiful and we are sitting on a massive supply of it. Maybe he likes buying oil from Mid East shitholes?
1711 2018-05-01 20:16:10 I forgot I used beard oil this morning and I keep touching my beard and my hands get all yucky
1712 2018-05-01 20:16:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, however left to bleed to death in his home.

1720 2018-05-01 20:15:35 they caught many of your witches, Manafort, Flynn, Pappa, Gates, etc. all except one folded, and will tell of the witchcraft Donald Trump is stirring in his cauldron as he burns the midnight oil.
1721 2018-05-01 20:15:24 Let me get this straight...Western Canada can sell oil to the US, but the US cannot sell oil to Eastern Canada....thought this free trade..Harper never got Canada East pipeline built
1722 2018-05-01 20:15:22 Ottawa made good this week on its promise to reduce methane emissions from oil & gas sector by 40-45% from 2012 levels by 2025 -- while US continues its self-imposed retreat from climate leadership @environmentca #betterrules #cdnpoli #ClimateAction
1723 2018-05-01 20:15:19 Oil change took for fucking ever 
1724 2018-05-01 20:15:05 Slim Pickins indeed.

Harper's degree was in Political Economics, but never had a real job outside politics (except Mailroom Clerk w Oil Company yr ago)
You don't make yrself look very smart when U don't have FACTs.

1726 2018-05-01 20:14:50 This one doing champion with hot oil I pity u
1727 2018-05-01 20:14:39 I'm not being reckless, the facts are out there. B4 Rockefeller's snake oil, most illnesses were treated with herbs, marijuana being one of the many. Big Pharma is opposed; you can't own a patent on natural herbs. Many alt.doctors have died thus far. See @unhealthytruth .

1732 2018-05-01 20:13:52 I found a video on how to cornrow and some tips on how to increase hair growth (that are easy so I know I'm going to do them.) Castor oil is being delivered...#2018glowup
1733 2018-05-01 20:13:48 Why is changing your oil such a dirty process
1734 2018-05-01 20:13:36 Dennis Miller is the guy who uses big words to make everyone “feel” stupid, but he just sounds moronic. 

This is the most water i’ve seen since the primordial soup detoxified like an exon valides oil tanker spill. Like some sort of a distopian liberal demential comatose.

OIL！
1736 2018-05-01 20:13:28 Followed all! Please follow back!
1737 2018-05-01 20:13:01 It’s essentially supply and demand. The supply of oil has dropped because of worldwide oil production cutbacks. There were 1 million fewer barrels in the U.S. last month than there were this time last year.
1738 2018-05-01 20:12:58 Or non return check valve anywhere? May be letting oil back through it
1739 2018-05-01 20:12:54 That's ok...
All the carbon tax collected in BC goes back to us residents of BC
Nice try.
Swing & a miss!

It's the greedy oil companies screwing us here...
1740 2018-05-01 20:12:37 I have also given up on looking for Oil correlations. It is a beast of its own.

At least you were going away from the tunnel! Watch out for that idiot "slow down before the tunnel" move
1743 2018-05-01 20:12:10 Don’t worry Alex, the lizard people already have cameras implanted in all our brains already right? I’ll take two more bottles of that snake oil when you get done yelling.
1744 2018-05-01 20:12:09 For the 1st time I have some Pak friends here in DC. Culturally, they are just like my Kashmiri friends and extremely educated about Kashmir and anxious to know more. In India, nobody understood anything/ anybody and never really tried with a few exceptions. Like oil & water. .
1745 2018-05-01 20:12:03 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
1746 2018-05-01 20:12:01 I hope I don't have an appendix. Is silicone oil sufficient for metal-on-metal lubrication?

1750 2018-05-01 20:11:42 Great when Oil get Florida in round 1 then Philly in round 2 only to get NJ who beat NYR and NYI in round 1 and 2.
1751 2018-05-01 20:11:41 I got an oil change for $8.50  great savings compared to $40 !!
1752 2018-05-01 20:11:40 I loveeee the smell of coconut oil
1753 2018-05-01 20:11:34 Coward.  You are held to ransom and you know it.  If you have integrity stand up to the oil snake brexiteer charlatans.  If they depose you so be it. They will have no increased support in the HoC anyway so the numbers will remain the same (or worse) for hard brexit.
1754 2018-05-01 20:11:25 There is absolutely zero chance of world war 3 been started by a Russian PMC attacking an oil refinery in Syria.

1756 2018-05-01 20:11:10 We save our milk cartons and all oil and any type of fat/grease is poured in that. Kept handy in the freezer. When it's full, our excellent local recyclers take it.
1757 2018-05-01 20:11:00 Thanks man heart broken after last night, changed my oil after a new top end on my fx and not good 
1758 2018-05-01 20:10:55 The container is full of MOTOR OIL. This does not seem useful to you right now.
1759 2018-05-01 20:10:46 I get plenty of unsolicited medical advice, some not just unhelpful, but potentially dangerous to me.  However I've never had people selling medicine, or snake oil treatments tell me I should go with their product, thankfully.
Must be very annoying!
1760 2018-05-01 20:10:39 Petit coup de cœur pour The Oil Fund à #SériesMania, j'espère que tout le monde pourra découvrir cette série 
1761 2018-05-01 20:10:33 haan shayad timing was wrong but it was triggerd by Gujral announcing a new Bangalore workshop which just happens to be same timing as urs... people who know you and your style of trading will agree you are probably the exact opposite of holy grail system (snake oil) sellers..
1762 2018-05-01 20:10:28 Before my daddy died I'm happy he taught me the main shit about taking care a car the tire and the oil
1763 2018-05-01 20:10:28 haha!! if man city with their oil money can't do it after a decade? how you are going to do it?
1764 2018-05-01 20:10:26 You’re welcome. Oil is very important to lubricant the engine , but we focused on the items that may causes accidents if we didn’t maintain.
1765 2018-05-01 20:10:25 Olive oil?
1766 2018-05-01 20:10:18 Only me and my head ass would get motor oil in my HAIR while working on my car 
1767 2018-05-01 20:10:09 Oh no, not at all.  When the price of oil dropped down to $30 a couple years ago, the layoffs were in the tens of thousands.  When drilling picks back up the increases are the same.  The oil business in Alberta is by far the largest industry.  Nothing else even comes close.
1768 2018-05-01 20:10:07 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
1769 2018-05-01 20:09:46 They lie together, oh, oil on water. And they lie upon her, oh, someone's daughter
1770 2018-05-01 20:09:42 I really doubt that also just a friendly reminder we cannot continue with business as usual as per the UN we have less than 5yrs to meet 1.5 degrees warming that @cathmckenna promised in while at #cop21 but hey both libs and ab ndp are owned by oil industry
1771 2018-05-01 20:09:32 gotta have something for the snake oil to cure
1772 2018-05-01 20:09:30 Helps laundering Russian money. Keeps oil prices high.  Win-win

I just have completed my exams and quite confused on deciding next step to get employ in oil and gas sector. Is there any additional degree or certificate courses available?
1778 2018-05-01 20:08:34 Oil companies hacked your Outlook and found out when you’re traveling, cracked some oil analyst knuckles and jacked the price. #Coincidentally

it only hurts

1783 2018-05-01 20:07:25 Mine is the same way. The Sheamoisture Yucca & Plaintain leave-in and using olive oil helps my hair stay less matted. The Jamaican black is great, but I think their most moisturizing is manuka honey mafura oil deep conditioner

1787 2018-05-01 20:07:00 Stop by today for an oil change or routine maintenance.
1788 2018-05-01 20:06:45 Actually Harper subsidised oil companies as well as funded the very same group that you are saying he did not fund.

1790 2018-05-01 20:05:48 It's to do with back handers. Money makes the world go round. UK sold down the gurgler by Saudi pleasing politicians. Saudi has upperhand with oil, which world cannot do without. Simple as that.

1793 2018-05-01 20:05:27 Dec 2018 oil Price $100 and beyond. Another war on the Horizon. Very Sad indeed
1794 2018-05-01 20:05:24 That sucks...I call Pittsburgh shitsburgh..it’s a literal shithole
1795 2018-05-01 20:05:23 Well of course not. Why would books written in an oil republic publish anything that discourages use of oil?
1796 2018-05-01 20:05:15 A group of Russian oligarchs mined data from social media for targeting a smear campaign and stole private information from DNC servers, in return, sanctions were lifted benefiting Russian oil and others, nothing much.
1797 2018-05-01 20:05:04 Pretty confident you’d be fine with them, skinned, diced, cooked for ages with shallots, olive oil, thyme, garlic, melting and sweet, then balanced with pucker cabernet vinegar and anchovy
1798 2018-05-01 20:04:53 LOL ! You are buying oil , not that country. Every country has its own ways to deal with other countries. Palestine has sent back that ambassador to Pakistan.
1799 2018-05-01 20:04:38 i wish i would chose acrylic instead of oil as my medium for this paint class im so tired of havin 2 let shit dry
1800 2018-05-01 20:04:32 He is a snake oil salesman. That’s everything that is wrong w him. He has been sitting in the legislative branch over 30 YRS. if he was going to get any of what he says done, he would have done it there. Cause that’s where they wrote legislation!
1801 2018-05-01 20:04:30 Hoping @Energous can talk about any customer wins during the conference call. If not, I think I'm throwing in the towel with the company. They have to this point been smoke and mirrors, snake oil salesmen.
1802 2018-05-01 20:04:15 Can’t have olive oil in it. MUCH too spicy
1803 2018-05-01 20:04:15 Thanks Oil
1804 2018-05-01 20:04:15 Oil that they have been looting codedly, u r hear complaining

1806 2018-05-01 20:04:10 Babe have u tried tea tree oil by aiken?
1807 2018-05-01 20:04:09 I should have bought flavoured castor oil. 
I can't stand the smell of the original
1808 2018-05-01 20:04:06 Pretty great day so far.

1809 2018-05-01 20:03:55 Why would a patient have to consume more calories to get the high they need? How about not limiting the thc etc and allowing patients to actually medicate. Ridiculous to say legal oil would help when it doesn't.
1810 2018-05-01 20:03:49 I really appreciate what u do to oil traders Twitter community. Anyways im still with paper money   cuz im new in this field came from stocks
1811 2018-05-01 20:03:43 Took an hour & a half for an oil change 
1812 2018-05-01 20:03:39 The US currency is backed by oil through the petrodollar system. Less oil is bad for the US economy.
1813 2018-05-01 20:03:29 @eurekavape
You guys have the best oil, hands down!  It's consistent, potent, and tasty every time.
1814 2018-05-01 20:03:13 A hybrid social democracy within a capatilist system, perhaps. 

The majority are employed outside of oil,which the individuals & the market own.  The best thing Norway did, was manage its oil profits very well and vote to leave the EU. A beacon to many.
1815 2018-05-01 20:02:56 وش؟
1816 2018-05-01 20:02:48 I do love the ‘miracle oil’ so this may have to be my next thing...
1817 2018-05-01 20:02:47 OIL DIFF: 6.35 -> 6.35
1818 2018-05-01 20:02:43 That's just a delusional perspective. Iraq was a regime change war in an oil rich country and there were thousands of civilian casualties, not zero casualties of any kind after the US told them what three targets they would hit. That's not how regime change wars work.
1819 2018-05-01 20:02:14 I hate doing shit like picking up my car when it’s getting an oil change like I hate it I hate waiting I hate paperwork i hate small talk I hate Edgar for making me do it this time 
1820 2018-05-01 20:02:07 President Trump next call must be to track down the bills hopefully some  poor cluck did there job at the mint before the IRAN shipment. We can  blow IRAN to smithereens they have to fear us what is the problem here.
IRAQ stole oil drugs and money got hit every time.
1821 2018-05-01 20:01:58 You should get an essential oil diffuser. Honestly it's some hippie shit but those damn oils work for me for so many different issues
1822 2018-05-01 20:01:32 I made a soap with bergamot but I used the whole bottle of oil by mistake so it ended up smelling how Sunny Delight taste
1823 2018-05-01 20:01:28 President Trump next call must be to track down the bills hopefully some poor cluck did there job at the mint before the IRAN shipment. We can blow IRAN to smithereens they have to fear us what is the problem here.

1828 2018-05-01 20:01:10 We had enough practice in Iraq, Syria & Afghanistan to make Iran a cake walk. But get hybrid cars now as oil will spike.
1829 2018-05-01 20:01:10 Yep and said fair price of oil was $75, surprised we got to it so far
1830 2018-05-01 20:01:09 You can make your own lip scrub, all you need is sugar and coconut oil lol

1832 2018-05-01 20:00:56 As long as you agree to do the same for oil and gas subsidies. And then everyone who voted for successive Conservative governments should be forced to replenish the Heritage Fund to cover the lost savings for future generations.
1833 2018-05-01 20:00:41 Had massive spending during peak oil era and now can't roll over the debt due to GBA sanctions
1834 2018-05-01 20:00:40 Oil prices continue to rise. 
Government is set to push for more  subsidies for those in need in an attempt to stabilize the economy.
1835 2018-05-01 20:00:32 Would you eat 5g of protein and 5000 calories or 20g of protein and 100 calories? Same goes for smoking 10% thc oil opposed to 80-90% thc. Less is more except if it's legal limited weed.

1846 2018-05-01 19:59:38 seriously for  a sugar lip scrub there should only be sugar and oil... there is no reason to load it full of chemicals and dyes... that ingredients list was scary. that $1 scrub is going in the trash
1847 2018-05-01 19:59:35 I had a massage today and the lady used avocado oil. How many houses can a millennial buy with one massage’s worth of avocado oil?

1859 2018-05-01 19:59:00 Put olive oil all over the noodles AFTER they’ve boiled and you’ve drained them. Just fuckin drown them in olive oil. Are you gonna have some noodles with your olive oil? No, your noodles have become olive oil. Perfect.
1860 2018-05-01 19:58:58 the funny (not) thing is that no one really cares bout the comedienne or that SHSs feels were hurt, we got bigger fish to fry and one of them is not frying another country for oil.

1880 2018-05-01 19:56:06 Getting my oil changed almost 2000 miles over when I was supposed to get it done.  whoops
1881 2018-05-01 19:56:02 So profound Ken.  After a few more one liners, I imagine your following might grow to L Ron Hubbard levels.
1882 2018-05-01 19:55:52 I wish she'd let him retire into consultancy obscurity in peace where he can tell them tales of losing in the Supreme Court, and how all he wanted was for oil to get a little respect, just a little bit.

1885 2018-05-01 19:55:43 It’s not my fault, I only shake down county contractors for campaign cash. I’m not good enough to shake down oil companies.
1886 2018-05-01 19:55:31 Pretty damn stupid. Just close your eyes, put a cloth over your face, and walk away. You can rinse your eyes with water if you like but tears work best.

Olive oil and dish soap are great for Fu-Gas, not so good for tear gas.
1887 2018-05-01 19:55:28 i got the jamaican black castor oil. i really need something to moisturize my hair cause it gets really dry to tge point where if i dont style it right away it will be matted so hopefully this works for me
1888 2018-05-01 19:55:21 Look at the planets they were on? In ruins. There’s no proof for most, he’s just claiming it helped. It was never talked about whether they were prospering before. Snake oil salesmen
1889 2018-05-01 19:55:04 Have a look at the wee sticker on the pump the next time you are filling up. It is not the oil companies, it is the government TAXES that are killing us, in particular useless carbon taxes.

1919 2018-05-01 19:51:10 One question:
What would be more beneficial for a transition to renewable (green) energies? A USA monopoly on oil trade, or a a bi-nopoly(?) ?
1920 2018-05-01 19:51:08 You are very welcome! /hugs!

1923 2018-05-01 19:50:57 1. When a gov't filled w/Christians, muslims, atheists, jews etc takes the decision to start an illegal war for $$$, that war is exclusively Christian only in terrorists' apologists sick minds. Jesus never commanded to go steal oil so that would be acting against their religion.

1926 2018-05-01 19:50:48 However, Iran sells #oil for #gold payment - as does Russia and as  proposed by Gaddafi.

1929 2018-05-01 19:50:28 Absolutely. Glad I’m not the only one fact checking @sjmuir. If #KinderMorgan was a replacement project for a refined products line it would likely have achieved FN support & be underway. If Big Oil hadn’t closed refineries in Burnaby-Kamloops It might even come with #bcpoli jobs
1930 2018-05-01 19:50:23 Evie read my comment again. I did not say it was good. I said oil prices could rise. It's bad for the world.
1931 2018-05-01 19:50:18 @TomSteyer is a fraud... oil man!!
1932 2018-05-01 19:50:12 The establishment (even Republicans like McCain and Graham) don't like Trump because they can't control him. The Military Industrial Complex hates him because THEY TOO can not control him or force him into another useless war for oil.

1935 2018-05-01 19:49:30 Yes and no.
If it rains all weekend then heck yeah.
If it just rains the day of the event then everything is an oil slick and a crap shoot.
Suspend the 6 minute clock..........
1936 2018-05-01 19:49:29 LOL. This keeper na crude oil
1937 2018-05-01 19:49:25 Are your cornflakes drenched in Coconut Oil? 
1938 2018-05-01 19:49:20 @jeffkatzshow I love how that lovely reporter thought those teenagers were vaping nicotine juice.  Teenagers are vaping marijuana in the form of hash oil or shatter as it only looks like they are vaping nicotine juice. The majority of these kids are getting high in disguise.
1939 2018-05-01 19:49:18 Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia are all success story when its oil reserves but Nigeria is the biggest failure of oil reserve, the said countries defeated their bandits alone but again Nigeria is seeking help to defeat its bandits, why who knows

1943 2018-05-01 19:48:49 That “disease” has caused the greatest advancements in human history.. the industrial revolution, the space race, the end of the Great Depression, and now the energy race to crack fission and fusion to make oil and coal obsolete which will end the need for war.
1944 2018-05-01 19:48:45 And of course the oil price (if it soars like it did 10 years ago) would be a deciding factor. Nobody can predict the oil price. I was once asked that question when being interviewed by CNN so you can guess my response.
1945 2018-05-01 19:48:32 Your allowed to continue business in quebec if you collude outside canada! eg... bombardier, snc, the Spanish, the French, the oil companies also!
1946 2018-05-01 19:48:20 Given the fluidity of language, art, music, food, etc., its not clear how culture can avoid being appropriated unless as you say, it goes extinct on an isolated island. 

Now, gimme back the olive oil, damn it....
1947 2018-05-01 19:48:03 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
1948 2018-05-01 19:48:01 word i was gonna use that but i don't have any so baby oil it is
1949 2018-05-01 19:47:42 I use tofoo brand press out the liquid with some kitchen paper, crumble it and add a little oil to a pan add the tofu and cook gently for 2 mins then add soy sauce, turmeric and seasoning - a bit of celery salt, seaweed salt or marmite on your toast will add extra savoury flavour
1950 2018-05-01 19:47:35 I’m starting to see articles pop up about gas-saving tips now that oil prices are on the rise. Here are the tips that I never see included:
1. Ride a bike
2. Take mass transportation
3. Drive an electric car
1951 2018-05-01 19:47:32 coconut oil is the answer
1952 2018-05-01 19:47:30 Pamberi nembanje Sekuru. Last week we just spent about £350 on CBD oil for my mum. We had to purchase it in SA because the ones supplied in zim are so secretive and one doesn't know if u are buying the right product

1955 2018-05-01 19:47:26 JTs govt is so quick to do Gender Analysis, study the impact on women by oil workers, etc. How about the impact on people ( not just women) of 1000’s of unvetted, improperly documented illegals into Canada. Only care about gender when they can stop fossil fuel industry. #Cdnpoli
1956 2018-05-01 19:47:20 Y.E.,both projects are in the Namib desert: one close to Swakopmund, the other one 90km from Swakopmund. Namibia’s Jojoba oil is known to be of excellent quality, with a higher Vitamin A and Vitamin E content than found in other oils. A great socio-ecological project!
1957 2018-05-01 19:47:15 vegetable oil? No, I havent got a #diesel motor.
1958 2018-05-01 19:47:02 Semen is a renewable resource, oil is not.
1959 2018-05-01 19:46:59 I have argued many times on these pages, and elsewhere, that the shale oil and gas revolution is the story of the decade. Since 2007 U.S. oil and gas output has risen by about 75 percent and the renaissance is still in its infancy stages.
1960 2018-05-01 19:46:54 My coworker just RUINED the oil and vinegar because I think he thinks the plate is just his. Now he’s smacking like he’s a home. Send liquor.
1961 2018-05-01 19:46:38 Varsity Reserve is the oil to a fine tuned machine (program)
1962 2018-05-01 19:46:31 Uh hu, and without oil revenue both NDP and conserves ran a bare bones budget with a 10 billion dollar deficit.  Without alternative revenue what is your plan to give Alberta the funds it needs to run even a modest budget?
1963 2018-05-01 19:46:03 be awash with data / bumper harvest / drizzle olive oil / vintner /
1964 2018-05-01 19:46:00 Use few drops of warm mustard oil. (Desi totka) use it on your own :P & get it checked
1965 2018-05-01 19:45:53 Ah, that explains it. You likely don't have a full fleet so your oil is being spent on 2 full lines instead of just exp for the required ships. I'm being almost as efficient as I can be with the farming. I'm just grinding exp at 6-2 right now. I think chapter 7 is too risky.

1967 2018-05-01 19:45:49 Just wanted to add that I asked, "Someone with ties to the oil, gas &/or coal industry?" That isn't defamatory, it's just a question because I've never heard of him. Blocking you now. Goodbye Ma'am.
1968 2018-05-01 19:45:44 Oil well fires are extinguished by placing a large explosive device at the well head and detonated.  So there’s that.

1974 2018-05-01 19:44:59 I can make things unhackable too! I’ll power it down. Where’s my money?

These snake oil salesmen get on my last nerve.
1975 2018-05-01 19:44:58 How can you make this claim and continue to support big oil by contemplating using tax payers $'s to underwrite an uneconomic pipeline that will make it impossible to meet climate goals and put directly at risk the BC coast, its environment and communities? Please explain.
1976 2018-05-01 19:44:55 That's cos the English establishment and media cant admit to England how much it relies on Scotland`s resources,instead they have branded scots scroungers while taking 90% of scots oil revenues.
English people should be asking how the scots managed good gov when WM cant?
1977 2018-05-01 19:44:36 Given all of the KM donations, not exactly a surprise.  Disappointing, though, to see how far KM's dirty oil money goes in #bcpoli and #cdnpoli

1981 2018-05-01 19:43:52 Need some help... I bought this painting at an estate sale.. it’s oil painted on canvas, it was professionally framed by some company that hasn’t been in business for about 40 years... I’m curious about figuring out actual value and possibly the origin... 

Any advice???
1982 2018-05-01 19:43:50 So I had to come get my oil changed and the guy behind the counter has literally been staring at me for the past 27 minutes.

1989 2018-05-01 19:42:31 No problem. I was just saying that social workers generally aren't needed in the oil patch. If you have a problem, it gets settled in the parking lot after work. LOL
1990 2018-05-01 19:42:21 The question is why would you trust a government who have managed to make £7m from oil, when just across the water they made £7b?  And they did that by removing less oil...
1991 2018-05-01 19:41:55 I just cut the tops off, coat in oil without peeling, and cook on indirect heat for 40 minuets or so depending on size.  Skin comes off easy after cooked. Slice up and salt

2000 2018-05-01 19:41:10 It’s true, we can’t use all of the same hair products. It could cause serious damage to our hair. Black hair does not naturally create oil as quickly or as much as white hair, and so we have separate but equal hair care products @DrewOnTheRadio
2001 2018-05-01 19:41:06 @realDonaldTrump a barrel of oil was $47.00 when you took office and now it’s over $67.00?
When is this going to get fixed? I’m on a fixed income and it’s killing me. Can’t afford to go anywhere.

2019 2018-05-01 19:38:52 I think Trump is pro-Saudi, pro-Military-Industrial Complex & VERY pro-Big Oil. So, no. Syria was already "lost" under Obama. Done deal. The troops are only there as an entry ticket to a possible peace conference re: Syria. But the 5th Fleet in Bahrain ain't going anywhere.

2024 2018-05-01 19:37:59 @realDonaldTrump why are you allowing these oil companies to continue to price gouge us. There is no reason gas prices are rising at the rates they are right now. Smh.

2027 2018-05-01 19:37:54 the biggest problem is the lack of oil lol

2034 2018-05-01 19:37:04 Told Jeremy I was going to get my oil changed and he put cash in my wallet to pay for it :’)
Lol he knows I’m poor
2035 2018-05-01 19:36:48 Without having your owner's manual in front of me I can't say for certain, but you're probably wasting your money. Please don't tell me you get oil changed every 3k just like the oil change place says to
2036 2018-05-01 19:36:40 Is the USA going to pay for the overthrow of Democratic Iran back in the 50's? For the brutality of the Shah? Will they pay interest on all the oil the west stole?
2037 2018-05-01 19:36:30 a lot of that is the light! With more capsules in the bottle, they will appear darker on the whole. That said, we made a point to avoid harmful colorants so the oil can vary in color, but if you ever have concerns just DM us!
2038 2018-05-01 19:36:18 Came to get an oil change and they hit me with a million other problems. 

 Just give me an oil change
2039 2018-05-01 19:36:14 Petrol 82.50 ho gaya hain aur crude oil is around 75$ per barrel hain.

2043 2018-05-01 19:35:25 Factories around emit chemical ashes that burn / affect eyes and skin , odorless chemical gases are purposely given off by militants from processing factories.

2044 2018-05-01 19:35:21 Or, men change your oil for you 
2045 2018-05-01 19:35:16  nah I’ve elevated from those. Family trait shows we’re susceptible to  hypertension so the oil used is changed from canola to vegetable/corn. Less fatten
2046 2018-05-01 19:35:13 Is it not by allowing thousands of gallons of oil to spill into soil and water repeatedly?
2047 2018-05-01 19:35:10 Crude oil ka international rate jab 105$/gallon hua krta tha tab Bharat me Rs.60/litre hota tha,aaj 75$/gallon hai to rate hai 83Rs/litre ,ye menhgai ka matlab kya samjha jaye aur kisi imandar aur kisi zyada beiman samjha jaye,sahab advertisement me hi bharosa krte hain
2048 2018-05-01 19:35:01 Headed to the statehouse now for a @MedPharmIowa press conference... we should be hearing from people who want to expand the reach of cannabis oil to more Iowans. I’ll keep you updated! @KCCINews
2049 2018-05-01 19:34:48 4 years. She gets an egg and an oz of olive oil every day. I live on a ranch and she’s a hunting dog so she always has plenty of exercise. The real problem is that the chihuahua thinks he’s a lab too.
2050 2018-05-01 19:34:35 Which is all part of the ecoterrorist plan. I do have a question for them though, so when Canada needs oil you’re okay with importing it from the Middle East? I mean, the overall carbon foot print gets slightly bigger that way, you’ve just changed where it’s coming from.

2052 2018-05-01 19:34:11 A little drop of cannabis oil under the tongue works wonders so they tell me anyways
2053 2018-05-01 19:33:53 An oil tanker full might just suffice. 
2054 2018-05-01 19:33:48 Sorry, this is a hard tweet to endorse.  GNA is not attempting to stop oil smuggling.  Too many of the militias they rely on are involved.
2055 2018-05-01 19:33:47 السادة الصيادلة bai attention please
في زيت إسمه bio oil في ناس بتقول إنه هايل و سحر للبشره و إخفاء أثار الجروح.... و في واحدة ع اليوتيوب بتقول إنه بيسبب كانسر من تركيبته افيدونا عشان عايزة أعرف أجيبه للوجي ولا لا
2056 2018-05-01 19:33:37 And we are coming into the season when I always have chives growing, if not scallions. And I always have sesame oil. :)

2058 2018-05-01 19:33:19 Bioderma also good. Was recommended to me by my dermatologist of a million years. There’s a range specifically for extra sensitive skin. I changed to more oil control since having kids my skin changed but still within the range.
2059 2018-05-01 19:33:18 Russian oil shipments to EU declined by 19 percent in the first five months of 2018 compared to a year earlie. At the same time, oil shipments via pipeline to China have surged by 43 pc. European refiners, in turn, will have to buy up more oil from the Middle East and the U.S.
2060 2018-05-01 19:33:05 Airport outta control...$7 for ah chicken leg da ain even fry in carnival oil chupes
2061 2018-05-01 19:33:05 I could be wrong but that’s cause y’all need the moisturizer in more long term affect right due to texture?? Yeah the only oil I leave in is coconut oil I’ve never tried to leave anything else in besides when I had braids. Because then that would be lowkey excessive

2063 2018-05-01 19:32:53 Closed in $NBL and $ATH today. Oil might dip in the short term, and I'm pretty heavily exposed with $BTE, $BXE and $CR in the energy sector. Really terrible price action on $NBL today following great earnings.

2066 2018-05-01 19:32:25 The saddest part? Venezuela is rich with oil and other natural resources. It could be a vibrant, wealthy country except its gov't decided to get greedy. Thank you for the information!
2067 2018-05-01 19:32:20 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
2068 2018-05-01 19:32:10 It’s bound to move under oil eventually

2070 2018-05-01 19:31:59 I lather my dm with baby oil so when you try to slide tf in you can keep going and slide tf out
2071 2018-05-01 19:31:57 When it comes to oil changes, the quality and type of the oil is very important. We will only use that oil that is recommended in your manual and specified on your filler cap.

2078 2018-05-01 19:31:19 Here’s a science fact for you: mustard oil not licensed for consumption in U.K. so all bottles you find here are marked “for external use only”. You can get it in most effnick shops though ;)
2079 2018-05-01 19:31:12 In areas they concentrate, $100,000 is barely making it. In most of country this is a very good living. Why not spread it around SJWs?
2080 2018-05-01 19:31:06 think ..the oil and gas industry pays employees a good sized wage , .....the liberal party does not want ordianry working candians to become interested in government etc.  because the liberals want only the 1% of canadians, elitists to run canada

2088 2018-05-01 19:30:22 That was a wholly different situation. They were plagued by corruption of thr previous government and other difficulties.
Ties up with a US corp. so they were not getting the profits from oil

2090 2018-05-01 19:30:00 Extra virgin is the highest quality olive oil. It's easy to determine EVOO from other olive oil by looking for these distinguishable characteristics.
2091 2018-05-01 19:29:57 I don’t have mustard oil, I tend to make a tadka of mustard seeds in whatever oil I have available. I also tend to go heavier on cumin in my curry tadkas, but that’s a personal preference.
2092 2018-05-01 19:29:49 i love eucalyptus oil it’s so relaxing and is very good when ur sick!!

2096 2018-05-01 19:29:02 Some holy oil...yes, yes.
2097 2018-05-01 19:29:01 I've done oil changes for the other car without too much hassle, but that's all mechanical. No computers to fuss with.
2098 2018-05-01 19:28:46 Went to get an oil change and guess what? My car is basically broke down according to the inspection report. #howamIdrivingthecar #icamefor1thang #mycaronlifesupportaccordingtothem 
2099 2018-05-01 19:28:35 Im having a financial breakdown after realizing bow much Im about to spend, these seating charts are garbage, Im running late for work, I got marula oil in my eye after putting in my contacts, my wig looks dry and crusty...all signs of a bad day 
2100 2018-05-01 19:28:24 In any case, I actually do have a meeting to get to, but I reject the idea of "ethical oil" if it means Canada is so great (not true) that it has a license to be enviromentally irresponsible (why would I want that to be true).
2101 2018-05-01 19:28:12 Tech end elitist snobbery of middle America? Concentration creates host of socioeconomic problems, amplifies wealth inequality.
2102 2018-05-01 19:28:04 It’s really just that lots of cheap shampoos have detergents that dry out your hair to a point so extreme ur body produces extra oil to compensate
2103 2018-05-01 19:27:55 If you ever need an oil change go see glen at the Jiffy Lube on Barry street, a very nice man
2104 2018-05-01 19:27:18 No worries.  I always try to make my communications suitable for the level of the audience.

I'm sure your oil company masters will tell you dilbit is sweet as lemonade but you best not drink it.
2105 2018-05-01 19:27:02 I attended oil spills. In this photo you see hoses on the bank of what appears to be a small creek. That is a lame attempt to suck up the oil. It  does not work well. It is amazing that they have yet to improve this system. Currents in larger creeks sweep the oil under the booms.
2106 2018-05-01 19:26:51 Its shorts and oil weather
2107 2018-05-01 19:26:46 Cheese, tasty tomatoes, olive oil, roast chicken, fizz r varying types and gin. Oh yes. Gin.
2108 2018-05-01 19:26:39 In Soviet America, oil pumps you.
2109 2018-05-01 19:26:39 Ouch. When I worked in Queens, there was a big jacked-up K5 Blazer with a bumper sticker that said “If you can’t stop, smile as you go under.”
Hope everyone is OK.

2112 2018-05-01 19:26:01 Fine if England block trade with an Independant Scotland see how long they survive without our water gas oil whisky food and any and all others exports and see how long they actually last without Scotland propping up the Ruk
2113 2018-05-01 19:25:40 I suggest she try CBD oil. A miracle oil devised from marijuana, that is been proven effective in lowering edema, and curing diseases that have made drug companies extremely rich. CBD oil maybe we'll help but you won't know unless you try it
2114 2018-05-01 19:25:31 I'll try that. I was cosidering trying it with baby oil gel but this seems easier.
2115 2018-05-01 19:25:29 Does baby oil work? I didn’t know that.
2116 2018-05-01 19:25:29 It was more than that. It was the set up for PNAC, Project for a New American Century proposing global wars signed off by Jed Bush et al before 9/11. Chaos=profits for oil companies, humanity be damned.
2117 2018-05-01 19:25:29 Who cares about what has been paid or not unless public benifited. Today price is low in international market but benifit goes to modi pocket. And the prices you hv shown is of that tym when price of crude oil were all time high in international market.
2118 2018-05-01 19:25:28 Wouldn't a condom mint be like chocolate, whipped cream, sprinkles?  Not olive oil?
2119 2018-05-01 19:25:26 gotta pick up some oatmeal shampoo and coconut oil because boosie has dry skin  
2120 2018-05-01 19:25:17 i forgot to put baby oil on my thighs. i’m about to melt 
2121 2018-05-01 19:25:12 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius
2122 2018-05-01 19:25:02 Experts say M&A needed to spur development of Nigerian oil assets.

Industry experts have highlighted the need for mergers and acquisition deals to unfold in the oil industry in the coming years to exploit Nigeria’s oil assets,@MobilePunch reports.
2123 2018-05-01 19:25:02 I said there's no more baby oil, you  get me?
2124 2018-05-01 19:25:00 Everyone benifits from oil the whole country benefits,Canadians under the liberal government have to be looked at world wide as totally mindless,the second most oil in the world and we have a government trying to phase it out!we phase are oil out and some
2125 2018-05-01 19:24:57 Everyone benifits from oil the whole country benefits,Canadians under the liberal government have to be looked at world wide as totally mindless,the second most oil in the world and we have a government trying to phase it out!we phase are oil out and some other takes over, nogain
2126 2018-05-01 19:24:50 Yeah I’d rather use oil to manufacture sustainable energy than light it on fire for temporary warmth, when it’s sensible to do so
2127 2018-05-01 19:24:49 Lmaoooo hell naw. I take a shot of the Apple cider vinegar in the morning with my vitamins then I drink black coffee during the day and a teaspoon of the black seed oil before my first meal
2128 2018-05-01 19:24:43 @realDonaldTrump revealed his hand back in ‘87 to invade Iran for their oil.  Bad poker player.
2129 2018-05-01 19:24:39 Here we fucking go again/More war+more idiots supporting it its going to be really good for the US if this escalates+it breaks out+markets collapse or go into overdrive +oil prices go up +++++/Iran is the NO1 supporter of terrorism blah blah no mention of US+Saudis/Iran-Iran+Iran
2130 2018-05-01 19:24:32 Yes, some people in some quarters are really making millions if not billions of naira. The mili and tary could crush boko if they are serious but no the fight is a milking machine, an oil field
2131 2018-05-01 19:24:19 A friend just picked up a tick at Joshua Tree, another location deemed "tick free," by hipsters visiting the park. It ain't. And the hills of OC are loaded as well. Me, I go BEACH. Attack them with baby oil.....
2132 2018-05-01 19:24:09 My old Peugeot 505 had one oil gauge, when you turned the ignition on the gauge told the level, then when the engine was running the gauge was telling the pressure. Brilliant!
2133 2018-05-01 19:24:06 Actually no .. when Saddam Hussein left hundreds of oil wells blazing behind him in the 90s, firefighters went in and used controlled explosions to put them out. EDUMACATE YOURSELF!!
2134 2018-05-01 19:23:38 There is proof that both uk and usa are puppets to the petrodollar. What saudi wants uk and usa get it. Iraq wanted to stop selling its oil in US dollar and that would have affected both dollar n pound.
2135 2018-05-01 19:23:20 An old doctor of mine with an MD & a PhD in Rheumatology and an MD in internal medicine practically ordered me to cook with coconut oil whenever I can. It's good for you AND tasty! Not fun to cook with w/o ventilation, but worth it.
2136 2018-05-01 19:23:03 I agree about the Saudi's. Oil & deep pockets, right?  But I wonder how we would react to a war on this continent.  IDK. I'm not sure Iran will stand alone if we attack them first under false pretenses. We are still trying to live down Iraq.
2137 2018-05-01 19:22:52 New rule: if you're in charge of ordering stuff for a place that primarily makes pizza, and you forget olive oil two weeks in a row, you're fired.
2138 2018-05-01 19:22:49 And just how many times have you said “Hillary” today? REAL AMERICANS would never let anyone get away with genocide. Oil or Not! I live in the refinery capital of the US. We don’t need S.A.’s OIL! Dim wit.
2139 2018-05-01 19:22:39 There is a very asian thing called aloe that can maybe help or coconut oil but i don't really know their attributea so i can't tell if it gonna help or not. I know they are good for skin tho
2140 2018-05-01 19:22:24 Our 08 Audi puts the light on when it only needs 250ml to top it up, we had an 06 Golf that was the same. 
But in older cars (like you say) the light is oil pressure only! Ha ha!

2142 2018-05-01 19:22:10 then the same stain following the directions.

If your ever going to use oil based stain outdoors though, I have rants about counteroroductive EPA rules!!!
2143 2018-05-01 19:21:53 It will augment income of farmers and cattle herders. It will create new opportunities for jobs linked to waste collection, transportation, biogas sales etc.
It will also provide stable fuel supply in market for oil companies and accessible credit. Gobar Dhan NDRI, Karnal

2145 2018-05-01 19:21:51 My dear is so sad but I must say that if care is not taken, the menace of boko may not end in the next 20 years because I perceive that the fight is now like an oil well for some persons
2146 2018-05-01 19:21:51 Then ISIS was quickly able to fund itself /w Oil sold through Turkey. Russia took advantage of coup in Turkey to stop that. They also accepted to sell a big share of Rosneft to Qatar. Why do you think? Big price to win they paid. And it worked.
2147 2018-05-01 19:21:45 if life has based on earth 4 billion years

why are we fighting over oil ?
2148 2018-05-01 19:21:30 Leathered up with coconut oil from head to toe. My skin feels like butter 
2149 2018-05-01 19:21:26 Poor bumper. Wow to his car. Yikes that's going to be expensive.
2150 2018-05-01 19:21:23 I am wondering Saudi Arabia’s export value, because it is one of the biggest oil suppliers around the world
2151 2018-05-01 19:21:22 We didn't waste it, we spent it & chose to have a lower tax regime than other Countries. We can't go back and un-spend it so none of what you say makes Indy more appealing. As an Indy country, Scotland would be highly dependent on oil revenue to "replace" fiscal transfer >
2152 2018-05-01 19:21:21 I miss my $20 oil changes

2154 2018-05-01 19:21:10 Squirrels can be dealt w a couple ways. A properly placed pole w a baffle on it lets you feed whatever you want. Brome makes the best squirrel-proof feeders if you don't have a place to put a pole & baffle. Most desirable bird species prefer the fatty seeds, esp oil sunflower.
2155 2018-05-01 19:21:01 But it’s important that us females know stuff about our cars like changing a tire and how to check our oil and about adding coolant

2166 2018-05-01 19:19:35 It's simple. We used to have a monopoly on the oil trade. Iraq dropped our fiat currency and profited. Iran, Venezuela + Russia saw this + took steps to do the same. Our economic dominance was at risk. Today, millions have died in the name of a faux "War on Terror." Questions?
2167 2018-05-01 19:19:29 Will the Space Force include a division of oil drillers? I've heard they're good with asteroids.

2170 2018-05-01 19:19:07 The past 9 increases in gas have been lead by Petro Canada. What's up with that. Oil is still only$60 a barrel. Wynn tax and the Trudeau carbon tax is the reason for these hikes?

2175 2018-05-01 19:18:35 This is ridiculous. Problem isn’t oil, it’s socialism.. I am from Brazil and we didn’t have that problem.. we impeached left president (maduro friend$ first.. if you make your economy 95% based on oil and grow government spending, one day it will fuck up
2176 2018-05-01 19:18:28 & agar petrol ke barrel price jaisi baat krni ho to research ye bhi karna ki last Govt didn't paid Iran for oil which we are paying now
2177 2018-05-01 19:18:18 and while we have Shanks, their transformative figure will always be an Arab oil billionaire  #levels
2178 2018-05-01 19:18:07 Don't @ us if you don't know how to check your oil

Also emissions free power - which Ill take over gas, coal or oil any day
2182 2018-05-01 19:17:51 I use coconut oil before bed st night and “real” hand cream at work. No problems and my skin is naturally dry.

2185 2018-05-01 19:17:43 This dude came in crazy confrontational towards some of our employees because he had checked his oil and said it was low.

"I'm never coming here again!"
He goes, while we realize that he had checked his oil on a hill and it was still full while the car was level
2186 2018-05-01 19:17:42 Out here in this oil filed they'll put you to work thats for sure. But its not bad though cant wait to come home and tell yall about all the funny stuff thats happened so far.

2191 2018-05-01 19:17:15 That sounds amazing. Now, how do you make your dal? Mine is simple - mix of split red and China dal, boiled with onion, salt and turmeric finished with a tarka of garlic and dried red chilli (fried using mustard oil), handful of chopped fresh coriander.
2192 2018-05-01 19:17:13 PDP cannot think beyond oil that is why Nigeria remained a mono-economy for the 16 years they were in power.
2193 2018-05-01 19:17:10 I can’t get over why some folks wouldn’t want to eat or even try Venison. Mouthwatering delicious is what I’d say these steaks look like. Kosher salt, coriander, black pepper and olive oil. Soon to hit the grill...

2196 2018-05-01 19:17:07 It also has palm oil in it& rain forests are being destroyed to grow trees to get the oil which affects the climate and kills animals native to the rain forest (they also burn the forest, smoke kills). Why is oil always such a planet destroyer whether from the ground or a tree
2197 2018-05-01 19:17:07 Black seed oil on the parts you see balding, at night before you sleep every other day, it's an essential strong oil so a little bit should do it!
2198 2018-05-01 19:16:56 I’ve got jars of coconut oil, we can speed the process up 
2199 2018-05-01 19:16:53 Let’s talk about WEDDING FAVORS: what would you pick from our products? A bottle of Wine in a wooded box , a small bottle of organic olive oil  or a jar of honey  ?  @ Castello Di Meleto
2200 2018-05-01 19:16:40 Smoke is too harsh for my 91 year old mother but I got her to try CBD oil. In 5 weeks she stopped her antidepressants and uses it topically for pain as well. Wish it did something for me but it doesn't. Can't believe we wasted so many years with the Reefer Madness mentality.
2201 2018-05-01 19:16:38 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
2202 2018-05-01 19:16:31 Trying to keep coconut oil on my burn but piper keeps licking it off
2203 2018-05-01 19:16:30 I... splashed boiling oil from the pan on my foot. Thankfully, it was over a thick sock, but it still left a big blister Dx
2204 2018-05-01 19:16:27 Last night, I made possibly the greatest brussel sprouts that have ever been made. Next time, I'm trying a bacon and beer braised recipe, but it will be hard to beat last night's. Oh, just olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic.

2210 2018-05-01 19:15:12 People get a piece of amethyst and some lavender oil and swear they’re woke
2211 2018-05-01 19:15:07 It just highlights what a bunch of EU snake oil sellers the Tory party has been  over the last 45 years.
2212 2018-05-01 19:15:05 She used that much oil she slid past the pro gamer she really wanted and end up in yours ffs...
2213 2018-05-01 19:15:02 2) To answer your other questions: I’m not a lobbyist & I don’t work in the oil and gas industry.

Our social-profit campaign has survived by selling t-shirts.

Unlike the much larger activist organizations, we don’t get giant donations from wealthy foundations outside of Canada.

2219 2018-05-01 19:14:00 I think they need to have a flex-off. For science. Preferably with good lighting and baby oil. Also for science.
2220 2018-05-01 19:13:58 ‘Largest supply shock ever’ could bring $300 oil, warns hedge-fund manager. That could backfire real quick and drive massive amounts of people to buy electric cars, so oil demand might fall drastically which is not what oil companies might want.
2221 2018-05-01 19:13:57 All the best chief- don’t get oil on the carpet! 
2222 2018-05-01 19:13:56 nothing gonna get you higher than a freshly charged oil pen

2242 2018-05-01 19:11:53 A lot of oils are toxic to cats and dogs so you have to research and make sure you only get pet safe ones. I know lavender and tea tree oil are the worst to have around cats. But there are a lot more.

2251 2018-05-01 19:10:54 We cut down our use of frying oil and if when we do fry we re use the oil in our other cooking spoon by spoon as the oil is not too used w our type of frying. Learnt this from our elders. So the oil that does get thrown is small enough to soak 1 sheet of papertowel and compost

2254 2018-05-01 19:10:36 Ebro, you might want to look at the amount of oil and rare metals African countries have. There's a serious vested interest in getting those for a cheap price.
2255 2018-05-01 19:10:34 Going unnoticed in ND and in America is how ND went from massive budget surplus to austerity measures in less than 2 years. No accountability for Supermajority Rep legislators who slashed oil extraction tax and overspent.
2256 2018-05-01 19:10:30 Saudi Arabia’s economy was solely based on oil... so were many other nations at that time... I ask you this... why is it a crash in oil prices cripples a socialist country to the point of no return but a capitalist country can weather the storm and be perfectly fine?

2281 2018-05-01 19:06:07 Yes, intimately familiar with it. It's easy to blockade. Price-wise, interdicting oil vs. taking off the market via sanctions is the same, but the former doesn't require the cooperation of other countries. We don't NEED EU/China buy in. We have a navy.

2290 2018-05-01 19:05:03 Nope, it shows how your greed for Iranian oil and market share blinded you to their lies. You signed a deal assuring they will have the bomb within less than a decade. You in fact, started an arms race that unless stopped forcefully, will see the Saudis and Egyptians go nuke next

I really need to change the oil in the Vstrom so I can basically put the focus away for the season.
2313 2018-05-01 19:01:07 In an astonishing display of idiocy, I seem to have lost a whole jar of calendula oil, which I infused myself, with marigolds I grew. My Mam grew. But still, where the fuck have I put a mason jar full of bright orange oil?!
2314 2018-05-01 19:01:01 @DCAToday do you guys still have the oil can sippers? If not is there a cars sipper out?
2315 2018-05-01 19:01:00 Ohh I've only seen them in oil and they're my fav thanks

IBB gave oil well to Sister Folorunsho. That's the level we aspire to.

2322 2018-05-01 19:00:29 Welcome back to Furthur, King of Midwest Hardcorps! @perctrax & @AnsomeUK hybrid live...I just went off like a fucked up oil rig. Who’s getting duct taped to a tree?
2323 2018-05-01 19:00:29 U are right, KM will not stop eastern Canada's dependence on oil from despot style countries. The way to stop that is with the energy east pipeline.

Campari tomato, fresh bufala mozzarella, basil and olive oil
2331 2018-05-01 19:00:00 Your living up to your nickname very well "Oil Tot", "young and operational"! I'm very proud of you! Hugs for Josh!
2332 2018-05-01 18:59:53 We can't compare to miles and miles of oil refineries, buildings in disrepair and a subtle stench of butt crack but to each his own.  Absolutely stay there Utah is awful! 
2333 2018-05-01 18:59:46 That's a good start.  Though Alberta's dependency on oil as a province, is really only solved with a PST.
2334 2018-05-01 18:59:44 natural coconut oil is all fun and games til your whole shit smelling like copra
2335 2018-05-01 18:59:32 Cars and trucks have never been more fuel efficient. After last oil crisis electric cars made a tremendous leap. I fully expect to see it again. Canada is a low performer in EV sales but we always seem to do much better when gas prices go up, go figure ;-)
2336 2018-05-01 18:59:29 I've been personally using CBD oil for a while - so many benefits!! I purchase it locally from a store in east Boca..  
my question is - has anyone used CBD oil from CTFO?  I would love to get some feedback
2337 2018-05-01 18:59:04 I recommend getting some raw sesame oil. it heats on contact and I often use this for my sore joints and muscles !
2338 2018-05-01 18:59:04 When I heard that knock and saw the tin of paint, I was expected Suwi to make an oil painting out of her. 
2339 2018-05-01 18:58:53 not sure if you are being sarcastic or not! I personally am a nuclear concert and think it’s a much better baseload electricity fuel than oil or gas in the times of energy transition (given that it’s done safely of course)
2340 2018-05-01 18:58:51 For what if they use cbd oil
2341 2018-05-01 18:58:48 Coconut oil
2342 2018-05-01 18:58:34 Oil slick 
2343 2018-05-01 18:58:20 Investor-State dispute resolution (corporate sovereignty) is different problem that also has to be addressed. 

That said, sometimes nothing is better than something and TMX is a good example. We need to ween ourselves off of oil and it's not going to be painless.

2344 2018-05-01 18:58:10 Too much common sense and logic Cody
Her and her ilk would rather bully the industry
It makes them feel better
Never mind that the oil they use is unethically sourced
Never mind that their activities cost us billions that could go to social and health projects
2345 2018-05-01 18:58:07 Richard, there is absolutely NOTHING this sniveling snake oil salesman does that DOES NOT shame the office!  In 60 yrs., I have NEVER been more ashamed & embarrassed of my country.
2346 2018-05-01 18:58:01  oil change
 tire rotation
 2 new tires
 front end alignment
 Only the first two were on the agenda for today. There goes this month’s budget. 
2347 2018-05-01 18:57:57 Might be the eucalyptus oil and turpentine.just googled deep heat ingredients
2348 2018-05-01 18:57:46 les augmentations diverses(csg _taxes Gas oil -transports-prix); 80 km/h plus de PV!! Merci Macron le pouvoir d'achat s'améliore. Ma voix tu ne l'auras plus
2349 2018-05-01 18:57:32 Does he even have an education platform? This man is a three planker- oil all the time in every way, NDP bad and Trudeau worse. Nothing else matters. He's obsessed and could care less about the rest of the citizenry.
2350 2018-05-01 18:57:30 Live in California with their smog check laws and high fuel prices
2351 2018-05-01 18:57:29 The protesters of the #KMPipeline say its all about pristine #CostalWaters and a possible spill, but how many 100s of oil laden ships pass thru the same waters. How many ships have spills?? Too many but never is it a pipeline! Its preposturous their logic! #TrudeaMustGo
2352 2018-05-01 18:57:24 Use vitamin e & argan oil to moisturize! A dab will do ya and it makes you face so soft
2353 2018-05-01 18:57:20 try mo ipangprito makakasave ka ng cooking oil HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH
2354 2018-05-01 18:57:13 They bought out their expensive committments in Niobrara. If they are able to sell CO asset. It'll change their capital structure. All their assets will look a lot better in 6 months. 100kbd of oil is a lot. Not as long anymore. Liking CRC,CRZO, SN for next 12 months.
2355 2018-05-01 18:57:02 God I love olbas oil
2356 2018-05-01 18:57:01 3/ There are many tools we could use, up to & including blockading/interdicting their oil exports. But what we really should be doing now is leafleting Iran & tell them how the Mullahs are wasting their money on this stupid nuke program that's just going to invite Israeli attack.
2357 2018-05-01 18:56:44 Only i can manage to burn my eye with oil from cooking meatballs in a pan... Meatballs 1 - Ryan 0
2358 2018-05-01 18:56:37 Seems #pulsar has the same batteries issue and oil leakage in engine
2359 2018-05-01 18:56:25 This still isn't a refinery. Gas is much more volatile than oil, and pipelines remain the safest way to transport oil
2360 2018-05-01 18:56:00 The irony
2361 2018-05-01 18:55:52 Some positive signs today if you're cheering on lower #gasprices as oil prices took a break, but while it may be a sign, we're also due for key government data tomorrow on petroleum.
2362 2018-05-01 18:55:51 They are bitter-sweet memories. GreadGrandPa still alive. Daily CBD oil controls pain in back, legs and feet..
2363 2018-05-01 18:55:35 I went into Walmart to buy oil for my car and I ended up piercing my ears while in Walmart and I forgot about the oil..

2365 2018-05-01 18:55:20 Just as I thought. Motor oil.

2367 2018-05-01 18:55:02 @ImanAbdulRahim Hi, morning kak! Nak tanya, boleh ke guna baby oil as cleansing oil? Sbb ada tgk indo youtuber ni pakai baby oil & micellar water untuk double cleansing 
2368 2018-05-01 18:54:26 I remember there was a car scrap yard at the end. Has to squeeze under the gate to get in. Was always covered in mud, oil and grease.
2369 2018-05-01 18:54:14 lol..ya know it was just one of those mornings!! If it's any consolation I cooked the pancakes in Olive Oil!
2370 2018-05-01 18:53:51 i spent $15 on one jar of coconut oil :) someone kill me
2371 2018-05-01 18:53:49 Gst crossing 1lk cr nd incr in direct tax collection r  news fr govt coffer.Eway will contri more in cmg mnth.Grey point to look in future is rain,oil shock,exports nd global growth due to protectionism/trade war/bond or geopolitical tension by trump idea @npal20, @_deepti14
2372 2018-05-01 18:53:46 Oh come on I look forward to my annual pay raise that is (squints) 1% over inflation.
2373 2018-05-01 18:53:41 One of our excellent young journalists has just been named a finalist for the Livingston Awards. Congratulations to Jie Jenny Zou, whose work exposed new dimensions of Big Oil's political influence -- "a government buy-in at every level." It's especially relevant now.
2374 2018-05-01 18:53:38 No bluetooth connection light. Low oil light. Incoming call light. air conditioning indicator. :P
2375 2018-05-01 18:53:36 Lol where do you go fr bc the cheapest oil change I’ve ever had was maybe $30 and I’ve been rolling since 2010 . I may have finessed a $25 dollar oil change with a coupon. But never $21 
2376 2018-05-01 18:53:15 Which is ironic, given it's original intention was to make FUN of corporate vehicles. Once you strike oil, there's no going back. Greed has won.

2378 2018-05-01 18:53:02 Sadly, the space battleships of the future are likely to look like oil rigs rather than sleek Imperial cruisers.
2379 2018-05-01 18:52:52 Cobalt can also be mined by adults. Child miners are illegal and major companies refuse to do business with suppliers that can’t verify that their cobalt was mined ethically. There is also a big difference between using oil once to make a car and burning it to move a car
2380 2018-05-01 18:52:40 Not yet...I imagine it to be like a yummy rich danish butter cookie in heavenly ‘atar. (I use 100 gr for the same amount of semolina)

But I need make a vegan version & think that much coconuts oil would not work so sticking to old recipe.
But yours is definitely on my todo list.
2381 2018-05-01 18:52:39 And meet Christ (the krystos oil) in the air and why the Bible talks about being baptized with fire. Its not literal it’s about going into meditation. I can take a drug addict and put water in the name of God and nothing will change but if the drug addict can learn to go into..
2382 2018-05-01 18:52:37 Kate looks like that woman who injected her own face with olive oil
2383 2018-05-01 18:52:31 Free oil change
2384 2018-05-01 18:52:27 Sauté some chicken in coconut oil, then add in some portobellos, squash, zucchini and garlic. Add a few dashes of low sodium soy sauce, then put in the fridge overnight and take it to work for lunch the next day. You’re welcome
2385 2018-05-01 18:52:22 I know the feeling.. Tablets, oil of clove, sensitive toothpaste but my favourite cure is 'Whisky'... Hope you feel better soon.
2386 2018-05-01 18:52:18 Oil prices retreat to their lowest finish in 2 weeks
2387 2018-05-01 18:52:07 Who cares. Like the US fuels anything crypto... 
If there was a token called OIL maybe.
2388 2018-05-01 18:52:07 Friend : you want anything from the store while I’m here? 

Me: get me some tuna- some Popeye tuna. 

Friend : what’s that 

Me: - the one that comes in olive oil.
2389 2018-05-01 18:52:05 Yea, oil going from one side to the other within the ram.
2390 2018-05-01 18:52:04  An estimated 175 Americans will die today because of opioids... not one person will die from Hemp CBD oil. 
jus sayin...
2391 2018-05-01 18:52:03 Is Pres. Buhari going to market what the Americans already know about our crude oil even more than we Nigerians know.@OfficialPDPNig
2392 2018-05-01 18:52:02 The artist that caught my eye that reminded me of the piece D.P. II by Daniel Ritcher was Tal R. There works look very similar in the sense they are both composed of oil and they focus on mixed media and color. However, they are different because... #conartinsitu
2393 2018-05-01 18:51:47 Wake up right now T&T. Most of these ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS and refugees are from Natural Resource richer countries, ie, Nigeria, Guyana and Venezuela. Venezuela is at #1 and Nigeria at #10 of countries with the largest Oil reserves.
2394 2018-05-01 18:51:41 Coconut oil is da bomb. I use it on my skin and hair too.
2395 2018-05-01 18:51:31 i cut my permed ends off and got braids for 3 months and it grew like crazy!! i put oil in it often but that’s about it

2399 2018-05-01 18:51:15 Just so we are clear it is Syria fighting ISIS not the USA. America is there only two reasons. Israel promised Trump Syria's oil and second to help Israel steal Syria's water and oil.
2400 2018-05-01 18:51:15 Europe needs to maintain good working relationship with the U.S. but it also needs Iranian oil to reduce its dependence on Russia. They will try to persuade Trump to not scrap the nuclear deal, for sure. In less than two weeks we'll see what happens.
2401 2018-05-01 18:51:15 Oil of Mercy. Your vitriolic actions certainly don't match your name. This is I tell gold from fools gold eventually some characteristic will be contrary to the real thing.
2402 2018-05-01 18:51:11 This man was an instructor at Harvard, is an oil man, Iraqi British.  Could his connections have gotten Obama into Harvard before he was an instructor? Supports development of Arab youth.
2403 2018-05-01 18:51:06 Lmfao a napkin? It’s so comforting then all you have to do is lotion and oil up and you’re ready for the day tho
2404 2018-05-01 18:51:04 "My feelings are genuinely hurt for the olive oil man, I feel really bad for him"
Honestly who do I live with this is bc someone did a shot of olive oil and didn't like it
2405 2018-05-01 18:50:57 I would really like to slap the shit out of my Comp 2 professor.. 4 complicated ass essays in the span of weeks.. this man is smoking baby oil

2407 2018-05-01 18:50:49 You don’t think those numbers were leaked by the Oil to make the actuals seem better? I do.
2408 2018-05-01 18:50:47 Yeah that’s where I go express oil change
2409 2018-05-01 18:50:44 Oh shit I might try it  I think that rose hip oil made me break out  I wanna keep testing that lol
2410 2018-05-01 18:50:29 oh no >< The other thing who helped me before was tooth paste or chinese oil, but probably not easy to get.
2411 2018-05-01 18:50:25 And I look forward to indyref 2 where I will vote YES this time and watch the wails of despair of red and blue tories as their empire of corruption comes to an end.  No more oil, renewables, Scottish exports for you to extort.  Clock is ticking.
2412 2018-05-01 18:50:17 It happened to Saddam and to Muhammar too when they announced oil would be priced in €€ not $$.
2413 2018-05-01 18:50:12 Oh 30stm are great, I’d like to see them live! I hope you’ll feel better by then. I think hot tea with lemon, loads of vitamin c rich fruits and I’ve heard also putting tea tree oil in boiling water and breathing in the steam clears you throat (it’s an antiseptic)
2414 2018-05-01 18:50:12 Eehhh I have to go to a dealer for my Hyundai until the warranty is up I think. And I usually go to the Toyota dealership but they messed up my speakers when they fixed my recalls so not going back to the one in Hoover. I went to express oil change last time.
2415 2018-05-01 18:50:08 our oil that old chestnut even Swinney stopped talking about it

2419 2018-05-01 18:49:49 What about Rapeseed Oil?  Is that as good as Olive Oil in this respect?

2421 2018-05-01 18:49:46 The fact that you fail to connect the abysmal HC cbd regs with the very proliferation of snake oil salesmen is unfortunate.

If you want to make real cbd, #JustDewIt.  Legal loophole is to sell as food product, not a "med" product.
2422 2018-05-01 18:49:26 Somalia is distroyed by civil wars. The Canadian government's approvale funding from puplic treasur money  is prudent decission.

2428 2018-05-01 18:49:01 Yea they finessing. I pay $21 for an oil change because I go on Wednesdays (ladies day) and $20 for a tire rotation/balance.
2429 2018-05-01 18:49:01 "Thank you, Saber. I'd appreciate it. I need a pot and some oil."

2433 2018-05-01 18:48:31 And I used just a drop of jojoba  oil
2434 2018-05-01 18:48:25 haha pero di ko alam kung pano nagkaroon ng ganun dun pero sinearch ko, mostly sa US and Canada ata may ganon i think. saka yun nga, galing yung oil doon. ang galing...
2435 2018-05-01 18:48:20 Su bhanallah....ka sha zuma, Allah ya baka lafiya.
2436 2018-05-01 18:47:58 Laaities these days don't know how to fight, change oil, fokol.

2438 2018-05-01 18:47:55 Chef McElroy cut up some Pikmin, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a blue stop sign, along with toothpaste.
2439 2018-05-01 18:47:17 Today I took my car to the spa. Oil change and tire alignment, new brake pads and rotors, car wash and vacuum inside, and filled her up (halfway cause only people with families fill their tanks completely). You’re welcome boo. Here’s to another year together 
2440 2018-05-01 18:47:11 Just remember, oil is booming worldwide and so are the direct results of climate change! Hand-In-Hand
2441 2018-05-01 18:47:01 raw organic honey or agave as a facial cleanser & raw shea butter and hemp seed oil for a moisturizer!! i SWEAR by these tbh they cleared my cystic acne & i don’t get dry patches at all anymore 
2442 2018-05-01 18:46:55 That's an area still being mined. There are other areas that have been reclamated are are just fine.
No one's water has been poisened in Alberta due to the oil and gas industry.
2443 2018-05-01 18:46:53 Is there a minimum number of times that oil change places have to try to up-sell you before just changing your oil and filter? I think that number is around ten.
2444 2018-05-01 18:46:51 What people keep forgetting is that a pipeline is the cheapest and SAFEST way to transport oil. So by opposing the pipeline you are actually doing the environment a disservice!!!!
2445 2018-05-01 18:46:47 I hope whoever stole my roller bottle of tea tree oil gets cold sores. 
2446 2018-05-01 18:46:44 I didn’t say pipe line I said oil expansion, more oil rigs on the water, bigger tar sands, and more pipelines
2447 2018-05-01 18:46:41 Is Mr. #NotAPresident & #BigRocketMan Trump threatening Nigeria, because it imports cheap oil to the US???
2448 2018-05-01 18:46:34 Why is it that when the price per barrel of oil was over $100, the price at the pump was lower than it is now. I can’t imagine it only being a carbon tax that is not even touching Sask. Someone’s making a profit...
2449 2018-05-01 18:46:28 Any good essential oil suggestions? Like super good scented ones lol
2450 2018-05-01 18:46:13 "im not putting eggs and olive oil in my hair thats disgusting" "ok but you eat taco bell so is eggs and olive oil really that gross"

2452 2018-05-01 18:46:11 Wow bless  my scalp hatesss oil and I couldn’t figure out what else to put on it so it’s just been sitting here dry as hell
2453 2018-05-01 18:46:06 Got that impression from hearings.
2454 2018-05-01 18:46:04 - Smugglers bringing in Rice & Frozen Livestock.
- Owners of Oil Blocks

2458 2018-05-01 18:45:08 You could always point them in my direction... stirring up action here today is like watching an oil painting dry!  :}
2459 2018-05-01 18:45:05 He'll never go until he has accomplished what the uber rich put him in there for. Complete illumination of all regulations and open season on oil drilling anywhere for starters. We r so screwed.
2460 2018-05-01 18:45:02 Must have been a blessing to be ale to offer GrandMa something to help her pain. I'm a big fan of the research and use of #Marijuana for opioid addiction, I am convinced it can work.  Now, I'm a big fan of CBD oil use, can't hardly wait to visit back in Nevada.
2461 2018-05-01 18:45:00 not coming from a Persian Investment. What oil are you selling to grow your wealth..? Has the so called Israel given it to you..?
2462 2018-05-01 18:44:56 Ah yes...  I googled & got this. Now I'm wondering who Rachel Ray is. :-) "If there's one word  in the food lexicon that Rachael Ray is most known for, it's probably her self-coined acronym EVOO, which stands for Extra Virgin Olive Oil, one of her favorite ingredients."
2463 2018-05-01 18:44:40 And hour for oil change. Blarg..

2467 2018-05-01 18:44:20 Who started the race between companies that want to get part or all of your @GOP Tax Cut (snicker) ....the Oil companies or the Health Care Companies .....Myself I think that the Corporations that kept the tax break and bought back their own stock are going to get the most ..
2468 2018-05-01 18:44:09 But CWebb and Spree were oil & water immature dbags back then. If they had classy somewhat comparable talents like Richmond and say Vin Baker they would probably have had the chemistry to title contend mid-late 90’s if Hardaway stayed healthy. Ah well. GSW fans have it ok now
2469 2018-05-01 18:44:03 Yes it used to be gas prices are high because oil prices are high but now oil prices are at a record low and gas at record highs? Seems like our leaders aren't doing good enough job of keeping an eye on these companies

2472 2018-05-01 18:43:01 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
2473 2018-05-01 18:43:01 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2476 2018-05-01 18:42:21 I have fallen in love with a creamy, flavorful pasta sauce that could not be easier to make. It's as simple as whirling a couple of ripe avocados, fresh herbs, and a drizzle of oil in a blender while your favorite pasta cooks. The avocado makes for an incredibly creamy mild …

2478 2018-05-01 18:42:12 Is Goo Lagoon an oil spill?
2479 2018-05-01 18:42:09 @realDonaldTrump We only have about 50 years left if we use oil at the rate we are. You need to encourage more efficient car and alternative energy
2480 2018-05-01 18:41:47 I used to be so confused by how badly my generation of Canadians has fucked up climate action, but then I realized 85% of the people I know making $80,000+ are tied to oil, and 70% of them graduated high school and just became ludicrously paid laborers so LOL 
2481 2018-05-01 18:41:41 What about olive oil? He practically pours litres of the stuff on, even bloody soup.
2482 2018-05-01 18:41:41 a wise man once said that when the Donald starts whining, Mitch Mcconnell writes a song about #love

2484 2018-05-01 18:41:21 Dike containment? Got oil absorber or kitty litter? Such fun.
2485 2018-05-01 18:40:50 can i buy the oil
2486 2018-05-01 18:40:45 If any thing he created the so call swamp and made an ocean of it ! With oil on it so all is going to Hell 
2487 2018-05-01 18:40:40 OPEC cuts will get rolled back as they realize they are losing out to "high priced" oil sales to the US. Its also a consensus long trade and the global reflation and growth story is priced in. Artificial production cuts can't last.
2488 2018-05-01 18:40:39 Instead of the paste, i use actual pieces of garlic and a liiiitle bit of ginger. Sauté the garlic, ginger, and pepper in organic coconut oil before adding the spinach to it. Also when I'm done and blending the mix, I add a quarter cup of skimmed milk for that mild creamy taste
2489 2018-05-01 18:40:35 I love it!  I changed oil and took cars through inspection as a job in high school. I also tinkered around with engines but spent more time working on the mechanic's books (now I'm a CPA LOL)
2490 2018-05-01 18:40:33 After extensive research I have determined that for the next three years, if I consume Dollar Tree discount candy instead of movie popcorn & soda, I will be able to afford a 2-yr-old used Bentley with lifetime oil changes.
2491 2018-05-01 18:40:33 In response to a lot of the above posts, moneyed interests have controlled our govt since the beginning. If it wasn't slavery it was steel, tobacco, food, oil, etc. Best we can do is vote for politicians to reign them in. Eventually things change, it just takes time

Oil can leak internally?
2498 2018-05-01 18:39:58 I know my hair is different but One ‘n Only Argan oil is my favorite. I even find that my hair can feel somehow more hydrated after using it and it doesn’t stink like other dyes do
2499 2018-05-01 18:39:50 How can we be brainwashed when BBC and the press only give one side of the story. No problem with them giving your side if it was part of balanced reporting. Simple example how many times have we been told oil is running out and potential new fields denied? The Vow enough said.

2502 2018-05-01 18:39:33 That's market driven for years now. Pray for crude oil prices to come down and also for states to agree to get fuel into GST. Will help to some extent.
2503 2018-05-01 18:39:30 Saudi Arabia is facing unemployment as oil prices drop. @calebmaupin joins @BartChilton to cover this and what it means for desert nation.
2504 2018-05-01 18:39:22 Make a pizza! Use a base of olive oil and Monterey Jack, add sliced squash and grilled lemon slices and bake. Top with caviar.
2505 2018-05-01 18:39:19 Oil change set up for Saturday and this time I will not miss it 
2506 2018-05-01 18:39:13 @nnpcgasNG Gas is the energy of the future. Nigeria has more gas deposits than oil. Nothing to worry as long as we make our processes transparent and accountable.

2509 2018-05-01 18:39:11 I’ve noticed something about these guys that fry stuff , Akara, buns, puff puff , yam , they will be stingy with the pepper, salt, maggi , sugar but never stingy with the oil , u can use their Akara to start your own anointing crusade service 
2510 2018-05-01 18:39:10 Ugh. Is there assigned seating & can you find syrup or oil or glue in the next few minutes?
2511 2018-05-01 18:39:08 My review about the pulsar bike. Within a week  batteries drained to dead and oil leakage in engine.
2512 2018-05-01 18:38:54 The long weekend was cool thus far. Had much fun with Ma, my brosin, my cousin and her son. #FamilyBopItMaster2018
My car though doesn't want to cooperate.
My engine oil indicator light said hello and I hope that my engine is ok with the oil I gave it now.
2513 2018-05-01 18:38:47 Those Scandinavian countries wouldn't be able to afford their generous social programs if not for capitalism – such as Norway’s wealth from North Sea oil. 
They are much smaller and homogeneous than US and taxed extremely high (but US richest are taxed more than their richest).
2514 2018-05-01 18:38:44 Change to cotton sheets for the coconut oil. Honestly it's a feeling you don't want to pass up. If your in Thailand just bring it to the massage parlor and they'll rub it all over you.
2515 2018-05-01 18:38:41 But Sir Ian Wood said the oil was running out? Was he telling lies maybe.......?
2516 2018-05-01 18:38:39 how are you feeling about Oil this afternoon?
2517 2018-05-01 18:38:12 Anything before 90 used good ol metal for fenders and bumpers! I had a lady plow into my bumper/hitch, car wasn't goin anywhere, she moved
2518 2018-05-01 18:38:12 You could make a little muslin parcel with herbs, salt and even a nob of coconut oil to get round that.
2519 2018-05-01 18:38:08 Internal oil seal on the ram? No visible leak but allowing the ram to depressurise?
2520 2018-05-01 18:38:01 A super lazy micro dinner - 1/4 baguette topped with vegan mayo, tahini, spinach, tomato, half an avocado & 2 violife slices; a good sprinkle of noosh, a drizzle of lemon & ginger rapeseed oil & a handful of coriander. Micro'd on full for 3 mins & then into my tummy - yummy :-)
2521 2018-05-01 18:37:54 I used to be really into that game. Only got as far as owning 2 oil fields though.
2522 2018-05-01 18:37:39 He is marketing our great farms that will feed us that oil that crooks steal
2523 2018-05-01 18:37:25 Get some lavender essential oil and a bag of Epsom Salt (Spearmint and Eucalyptus is my favorite). The essential oil can be put in your bath with the Epsom Salt for a great smelling warm bath. I usually do that once a week to really get my mind going in a creative sense.

2526 2018-05-01 18:36:46 Snake oil 
2527 2018-05-01 18:36:38 I find it odd how transmountain, energy east, and keystone are all fought to the death. Yet the US has built countless other pipelines in the interim. 

It could be coincidence, but is it possible the US oil patch is intentionally sabotaging the Canadian oil patch?
2528 2018-05-01 18:36:36 I actually just did a paper on chad, they are one of the worst, most impoverished countries in the world and noone ever mentions the aid they truly need because they have oil and cotton smh
2529 2018-05-01 18:36:28 It’s not!! It’s a cry for help! Not sure what to do current thinking is 24 cans of Neck Oil and 24 cans of Gamma Ray!!
2530 2018-05-01 18:36:19 The swamp only awarded Hillary's brother with a speculative gold mine in Haiti....obviously this oil deal more attractive given the higher caliber swamp creatures!
2531 2018-05-01 18:36:18 I low key want to add a hair dye incentive for my St Jude campaign. Nothing SUPER crazy but like idk maybe an oil slick, hidden rainbow IDK
2532 2018-05-01 18:36:17 Ta did you put the oil in your motor
2533 2018-05-01 18:36:16 Local is better. Think of the effects of transportation fanning out. Part of the reason Canadian Cariboo are going extinct is for oil. To look like they are saving Cariboo they shoot the wolves. Oil is for transport and manufacturing. Just the tip.
2534 2018-05-01 18:36:07 A bottle of sesame oil exploded in my box of Korean groceries, and while I have to wipe off everything, at least my hands smell delicious.
2535 2018-05-01 18:35:52 Roughly how much of each did you use? I tried bronzer in baby oil and it was an epic fail.
2536 2018-05-01 18:35:49 Coming from someone who's had a concussion:
1. Stay off the computer and TV. Your brain needs to rest.
2. Follow your doctor's orders and take the full amount of time to recover.
3. Eat healthy fats like olive oil, coconut oil, fatty fish, etc. This really helped. Get well soon

2541 2018-05-01 18:35:25 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
2542 2018-05-01 18:35:20 Last as long as what?

Anyway, latex based outdoor paint with low EVA is what's recommended. I suspect oil based stains would smell too bad to the bees.
2543 2018-05-01 18:35:14 Heh heh! I’m thinking extra virgin olive oil?

2556 2018-05-01 18:34:09 We're having curry in the Instant Pot tonight. It's super easy and keto friendly. Just chicken, aubergine/eggplant, a bit of coconut oil on saute for three minutes. Then add water and put on manual for 8 mins. When it's done, pour out water. Add jarred sauce and saute for 5 mins.
2557 2018-05-01 18:33:59 Will that last as long? I know with oil based stains if you thin more than 15% you voilate EPA rules, but end up with a stain thats way more durable (more years between repaints)

Latex is a completely different animal though. I'm just very picky about outdoor paints
2558 2018-05-01 18:33:49 Last year when GreatGrandMa was dying, CBD oil controlled pain she was able to not be bedridden. Quality of life on CBD better than opioids that caused her to sleep all the time.
2559 2018-05-01 18:33:44 pitiful, really
but reminiscent of oil
2560 2018-05-01 18:33:34 Thank you for your environmental leadership @JerryBrownGov! The states must continue to defend the rules that save drivers money at the pump, cut oil consumption, reduce air pollution & curb greenhouse gases.

Once the material has melted all the work will also vanish. 

This is a typical construction where two similar things or actions are juxtaposed to represent emphasis or contrast.
2562 2018-05-01 18:33:27 Wouldn’t this theory run into the problem that, during the expansion, oil prices peaked in 2011?

2575 2018-05-01 18:32:35 Part 3 What USA did to Iran for decades because of oil was terrorism.  Saudi Arabia attacked USA on 9/11 and USA still sells it weapons.  Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 and USA chose to stack Iraq without a Declaration of War from Congress.
2576 2018-05-01 18:32:26 I’ve never tried it. I use face soap or scrub and moisturizer. maybe a lil oil if I’m feeling froggy. Smh at this hot mess.
2577 2018-05-01 18:32:17 To clarify, all those arab names you see are from the 'terrorist watch' days. Trump added the new category of 'Magnitsky/human rights violators', also Libyan oil smugglers, and other sanctions acts. So this is a master list of all.

2580 2018-05-01 18:32:05 Fool. Have you any idea how much wealth oil companies create , and the taxes they pay???
2581 2018-05-01 18:31:51 Capitalism is FREE MARKET enterprise.  Oil will be burned, coal will be burned via Capitalism. Are you for the burning of coal and oil?  

I think we have a denier here?
2582 2018-05-01 18:31:48 Yeah. Breaking into a fast food restaurant and drinking oil is beyond overeating. This is a mental problem.
2583 2018-05-01 18:31:39 Broo, we are just focused on oil and gas only over here in Africa. Maddd research going overseas. I’ll send you something on that ichemE stuff via email later today.

2588 2018-05-01 18:30:21 Agree. I eat what I want, when I want and I'm not overweight or unhealthy. It's not just his face that's fat, it's all of him. That's why I get so angry when he tries to lecture us. He's no oil painting after all 
2589 2018-05-01 18:30:20 Hey brother you need to send me an address so I can send you some oil for that epic man mane you have growing! Looking good bro!

2591 2018-05-01 18:30:15 Since body lava sucked and was a waste of $60 USD, I tried mixing some highlights and old bronzers I had into aloe vera gel with a tiny bit of oil and it's a 10/10
2592 2018-05-01 18:30:05 He's a snake oil salesman. Still works on idiots though....
2593 2018-05-01 18:29:55 HAHAHA Can you imagine the INSTANT regret the Nightborne must have felt upon stepping RIGHT into the goblin parts of Orgrimmar

Ahh I can't wait to meet my new allies! (accidentally steps in a pool of sticky oil, dust in your eyes, an unqualified zombie greeting you) ahhh
2594 2018-05-01 18:29:48 "I didn't tell President Trump to buy our crude oil, we already have steady markets, I told him to invest more in the technological aspect of oil in Nigeria......"

2595 2018-05-01 18:29:47 The same ideologies that have been working for decades to shut down our energy production and increase our dependence on middle-eastern oil, is also working against domestic agriculture
2596 2018-05-01 18:29:43 Was suppose to be going get an oil change but guess who seen my car & hooped in .. Saniyah 
2597 2018-05-01 18:29:38 Your name probably got you shadow banned automatically.
2598 2018-05-01 18:29:37 This is why your not getting CBD oil
2599 2018-05-01 18:29:30 actually with either truffle oil or balsamic glaze it would be perfect & they would have to name it after me. the Crazy Lady pizza.
2600 2018-05-01 18:29:12 I wondered why Macron was AGAINST ending Iran deal. Did some research & discovered oil conglomerate Total SA, partly owned by govt of France, cut $4.8 billion deal with Iran in July 2017 to develop South Pars oil/gas field (largest in the world) in Persian Gulf. Hmmm

2603 2018-05-01 18:28:58 This the best service I got from a oil change spot in a minute... got offered free donut, coffee, some pizza and a lower price for the service.
2604 2018-05-01 18:27:51 #DollarIndex rose to the highs of the year as investors awaited #FOMC outcomes, expected two or  three rate #hikes this year.
U.S. #stocks fell, driven by tumbling oil prices & growing fears that #tariffs & #inflation could weigh on corporate profits.
2605 2018-05-01 18:27:50 Ini aku juga ada coconut oil nih mik di rumah. Nonton yutup katanya kumur itu 30 menit, jd sambil ngapa2in di pagi hari sambil kumur itu. Sampe skrg belum tertarik nyoba sih, ga punya cukup komitmen selama 30 menit

2608 2018-05-01 18:27:40 I can understand why I wouldnt Bc my culture has spices that stain the crap out of pretty white surfaces.  I’ve seen a lot of people with white backsplashes, I have one. Whenever I cook bacon I CRY. The oil gets everywhere. Curry? Meat sauce? Coffee spills?
2609 2018-05-01 18:27:31 Need a new oil control serum

2611 2018-05-01 18:27:26 this whole trump and buhari thing reeks. in two weeks we will now find out all our remaining oil has been sold for two tractors
2612 2018-05-01 18:27:24 Sounds like the sentiment in 2008 when oil hit $140
2613 2018-05-01 18:27:21 "Oil is on the boil but your petrol bill won't go up, all thanks to Karnataka polls" @dpradhanbjp

@narendramodi Sir we as citizens feels Elections should be held every month across INDIA, atleast we will be saved from the pinching prices.
2614 2018-05-01 18:27:18 My golden delicious apple blooms are beautiful! Going to get the oil to treat it so it can produce insects free!
2615 2018-05-01 18:27:11 Interesting article considering that high oil prices lead to high cost of goods. #MavOrg

2619 2018-05-01 18:27:00 Part 1 USA has a Declaration of Independence so it would be in control of its resources.  USA nationalized industries in World War 1, World War 2.  Truman discussed the importance of coal to USA while President - speeches are on net.  Oil more important to Iran than coal to USA
2620 2018-05-01 18:26:59 Still waiting on this damn oil change 
2621 2018-05-01 18:26:42 Our problem is exactly socialism. A huge fiscal deficit,at least 20%GDP,financing by central bank, the economy is in its 5th recession year. Enormous corruption, a thousands millions dollars have been found in fiscal paradise. Oil company is in a production level of 40yr ago.
2622 2018-05-01 18:26:31 19 high jackers wr saudi bt sins Trump&Israel hate Iran and love Saudi oil,, they are gonna make Iran pay for that ...lol wt a joke
2623 2018-05-01 18:26:23 What’s some cheap places to get an oil change in San Marcos?
2624 2018-05-01 18:26:05 Because they think they're cool when they're actually not. Usually only MEN drive trucks. By that I mean MEN who actually act like men should.
2625 2018-05-01 18:26:03 Went in for a routine oil change, ended up needing new air filter and bunch of other shit fml 
2626 2018-05-01 18:26:03 That money @realDonaldTrump's been laundering for decades? #Heroin and other narcotics trafficking profits. 3rd world #HumanTrafficing #Capital. #ISIL oil profits being turned around by #EU slime-ball banks. I mean IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD PEOPLE. Midterms look BAD for #Humanity
2627 2018-05-01 18:25:54 I would do that covered in baby oil for 500k dollars.
2628 2018-05-01 18:25:38 Life changing tip: apply body oil while your skin is still wet. The oil will spread more evenly on contact & it will absorb more easily into your pores.
2629 2018-05-01 18:25:35 Ewww dude, I knew it.
2630 2018-05-01 18:25:27 Would anyone like Olive Oil Soap or Aloe Vera and Olive Oil Soap from Turkey ?  100% hand made.!!!! Let me know please..message me
2631 2018-05-01 18:25:20 That Stuart is using Govt. modelling of 15 years ahead. The same experts been off the rails one year ahead. Go back 15 years & show us how accurate any of their projections been to now. Stuart you indeed are a snake oil salesman copying & pasting nonsense
2632 2018-05-01 18:25:19 One the one hand Cruz is rejected as not really being Hispanic, being Cuban. On other hand those same ppl condemn for no Spanish. 
2633 2018-05-01 18:25:16 Once again @CynthiaHCoffman puts oil & gas $ ahead of Colorado citizens by failing to stand up to @realDonaldTrump @EPA in the states' auto emissions suit. Thanks for caring, Cynthia.
2634 2018-05-01 18:25:15 Liverpool played against oil whores , the CL winners and the team that smacked Barca. Big difference
2635 2018-05-01 18:24:56 Watching the MVP protest go on reminded me of a film I'd seen about the oil industry and how people who stand in their way get pushed aside. There will be Blood.
2636 2018-05-01 18:24:53 Bibi, Bolton, Now Blair, all talking about the nuclear deal. All because Bibi doesn't want to pay the sanction money from oil embargo. Bolton just wants war, and so does Pompeo.
2637 2018-05-01 18:24:48 Their economy is based mostly on oil, the price of oil collapsed in 2013/14 and devalued 95% of their exports. They were forced to take out loans, which have exacerbated the issue due to them adding interest and loan repayments to state budgets.
2638 2018-05-01 18:24:46 My mum will still give you prayer water and anointed oil .
2639 2018-05-01 18:24:40 the amount of times I've brought up nuclear and then immediately get responded to by oil shill #23 "Chernobyl though" is unreal. people just need to learn more, actually know how these power sources work instead of basing your assumptions off of a single disaster.
2640 2018-05-01 18:24:33 tea tree oil really makes the pimple disappear overnight >
2641 2018-05-01 18:24:21 @SenMarkey Pruitt and his backers are unhinged. We are witnessing them crawl out of their fake agendas and stand in their true form, guardians and patrons of the oil, gas and chemical industries. As it stands they will stop at nothing to push their deregulation for profit agenda.
2642 2018-05-01 18:24:14 i do not. i follow share cause it impacts meal. oil is part of share.
2643 2018-05-01 18:23:26 A weird thing about oil change places: expecting the mechanics to upsell filters and services. I wonder if there's a commission structure.
2644 2018-05-01 18:23:17 I def fell asleep while I was doing my hot oil treatment lol lazy dayz
2645 2018-05-01 18:23:16 Indian oil, Hindustan petroleum and bharat petroleum
2646 2018-05-01 18:23:09 The point is that the oil is being traded to benefit the collective, rather than just to enrich a select elite.

You're correct that it would fit under free market economics, although market socialism is also based on free market exchange, so it's not exclusive to capitalism.
2647 2018-05-01 18:23:08 I had really aggressive dreams these past few weeks, it made me really exhausted. My therapist suggested applying lavender oil on my neck and base of my feet before sleeping, it's been ok so far....?

They're expensive tho. RM140 for 15 ml...geez
2648 2018-05-01 18:22:41 1. That lil cocoa oil u had put that shit on lock.                                                       2. I said what I said. Ladies love bubba
2649 2018-05-01 18:22:39 I just changed my own oil this weekend.

2651 2018-05-01 18:21:57 Missed the Kardashian dating talk. Great show today.
2652 2018-05-01 18:21:57 Is there any point in watching the oil rumble kick-off ... was there a match?
2653 2018-05-01 18:21:33 Or obstruction.
2654 2018-05-01 18:21:08 I been sitting in this firestone for 2 hours, but it’s ok bc Candace needed an oil change.
2655 2018-05-01 18:21:04 need to change the oil in the rzr  do not wanna lol would rather come see you and drink long islands 
2656 2018-05-01 18:20:59 Where’s the business case for Canadians of this amazing opportunity we apparently are missing out on. The PM himself is quoting 15 Billion annually. Who’s the buyer? What’s the price difference between loading oil on an oil tanker or selling it safely to the US by pipeline?
2657 2018-05-01 18:20:40 At the dealership getting a oil change, bouta go see the avengers.
2658 2018-05-01 18:20:27 This is exactly what happened in #Mexico back in the 70's, oil+weak institutions+populisms+economic ineptitude of our leaders= hyperinflation, skyrocketing poverty rates, devaluation, violence, crisis.

Although I think, we've never been as screwed as #Venezuela is now.
2659 2018-05-01 18:20:19 Zionists are interested in Kurdistan Region because of their oil, because of the wealth of their land, zionists are importing 77% of their oil consumption from Persian lands, from Iraqi Kurdistan Region.

2661 2018-05-01 18:20:10 Horseshit.  The regime is so corrupt and incompetent they can’t even get the oil out of the ground.
2662 2018-05-01 18:20:00 I wouldn’t clean it so often, actually. When I had mine, I would clean it once/ twice a day at MOST. You’ll irritate it if you’re constantly cleaning & touching it. Use tea tree oil & press it for a min or so then leave it on while you sleep :).
2663 2018-05-01 18:19:50 Are you sure? Three of these companies rank very well in the WWF palm oil monitoring system.
2664 2018-05-01 18:19:49 We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products, Karino. Our priority is to avoid using palm oil unless it is absolutely necessary for the quality.
2665 2018-05-01 18:19:20 dumb simple... oven on 425 put them in for like 30-40 minutes with the seasonings and olive oil. shit tastes perfect. shout to pintrist lmao

2667 2018-05-01 18:19:07 Fight all you want but there are a whole lot of policemen and public servants doing a great job and have stayed true to their calling. Their records unfortunately get stained by the proverbial finger that refuses to stay away from oil.

2671 2018-05-01 18:18:42 @MSNBC  is it possible that China is behind North Korea wanting peace? Promising N.K.lots of goods n oil so the United States will withdraw troops from South Korea and the Sea of Japan which is what China has wanted since the Korean War. Trumps a FOOL!

2675 2018-05-01 18:18:17 $klxi and $ba deal assessment: the oil service industry trades 4 to 7 times Ebita. Given most peers have high debt level, the spinoff without debt probably worth 600 to 700million ($11-13/s). Plus the $63 cash from $ba. The total value for $klxi is around $74-76. Tax is extra.

2679 2018-05-01 18:17:53 I'm in the soybean oil business.  Give me a follow and I will dm you some more information.
2680 2018-05-01 18:17:53 Remember my cp?..that's y.......jokes aside..this is just another day in oil field..very risky..but lot of fun
2681 2018-05-01 18:17:44 We can use whatever currency annoys rUK Little Englanders the most. Especially when they are having to use it to buy our oil.
2682 2018-05-01 18:17:39 Ya if u don’t take into account that we’re seating on top of billions of barrels of oil. that leaves this state daily kock brothers closed our refinery now we have pay for imported oil now that my friend makes absolutely no sense to me
2683 2018-05-01 18:17:38 They owe Iran for oil refining from the 1970s  - which payments were frozen because of revolution, then interest charges since then. This is all part of the Iran deal, just like the US repayment of $1.6billion we owed Iran.
2684 2018-05-01 18:17:37 This why I need a man I’m tired of getting the oil changed n shit
2685 2018-05-01 18:17:25 Military aggression against Iran would be seen most unfavorably by Beijing, which is dependent upon oil deliveries from Persian Gulf.
2686 2018-05-01 18:17:16 Hey I think that's the Nigerian prince who wants to transfer a $1 million from a huge oil contract to me if I open a Nigerian bank account with $100k in it...
2687 2018-05-01 18:17:05 Gorge W. Bush is the one who lied. UN inspectors were on the ground in Iraq. They told Bush before he invaded there were no weapons there. In the end we didn't invade because of WMD. We invaded to "liberate" Iraq. The mission was called Operation Iraqi Liberation (OIL).
2688 2018-05-01 18:16:57 But... I said that it was capitalism “ON THE FACE OF IT” trading their oil for a service in return for them both to profit. Maybe I should have said “that’s an exchange that would fit in under free market economics”
2689 2018-05-01 18:16:41 Chef Louis cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was 1000 rat corpses, along with toast.
2690 2018-05-01 18:16:19 Forgot oil on feet is not a good idea when you have sandals on
2691 2018-05-01 18:16:17 That sounds great. I’d like to do a trip in Italy biking between vineyards, oil and cheese makers and fun spots to sit and eat or drink. #BizHeroes
2692 2018-05-01 18:16:13 This is a refinery, not a pipeline. Pipelines are still the safest way to transport oil. Gas pipelines are the more dangerous ones, (but BC has no problem approving those)
2693 2018-05-01 18:16:12 Proud to be a native Californian. We will not let them undo decades of work. P.S. No oil drilling off of our coast. Not Happening.
2694 2018-05-01 18:16:11 Hate going to the express oil because they always telling me what’s wrong with my car 
2695 2018-05-01 18:16:06 Messed up that we are at #gas prices from @GWBush times which equals rise in the price of living all the way around @realDonaldTrump how can you let this happen again it's even worse for you cause we now produce enough #Oil to name our own prices bring back police for oil
2696 2018-05-01 18:15:52 As for Venezuela, EVERY oil-producing country had to deal with the global economy, oil market, competition, etc., but Venezuela's govt responded the worst out of them all, and their system allowed no way to remedy this. Single-point failure, no checks & balances.
2697 2018-05-01 18:15:46 The lazy youths how will they embraced farming when we have oil and not just oil but one of the best in the world
2698 2018-05-01 18:15:43 @jmcdowell20 What oil and gas companies should i go to, to get more Power washing business?
2699 2018-05-01 18:15:42 Try some Cbd oil for end of ire. I’m sorry honey 
2700 2018-05-01 18:15:30 my old boss used to moan about not making enough money but one time he left his etrade account open on one of the computers and he had lost $300,000 trading on oil futures
2701 2018-05-01 18:15:17 My beard is at the longest it's ever been, time to start oil treatment. And got a tash comb to start curling my musketeer mustache 
2702 2018-05-01 18:15:15 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
2703 2018-05-01 18:15:14 Aileen, I haven't sold snake oil in years. I've moved on to smoke and mirrors!Congrats on having the same job for 27 years. That's very rare today, and there's nothing wrong with that. Me personally, I choose to be in control of my time and how much money I make.
2704 2018-05-01 18:14:59 Meanwhile how many people in your oil rich constituency need to go to food banks?
2705 2018-05-01 18:14:57 I used to weaken my relaxers with olive oil though. More of a texlax then actual relaxing.
2706 2018-05-01 18:14:52 The Kurdistan Communist Party marched today in support of Labor Day, workers' rights, they were chanting "hey the government of saving salaries, where are the revenues of gas and oil." #LabourDay
2707 2018-05-01 18:14:51 Hahahaha.. Na oil well be that
2708 2018-05-01 18:14:48 Do you have actual evidence of 'supporting antivax' and 'snake oil'? Or is it just more obfuscation in action.
2709 2018-05-01 18:14:46 Caught @lizzo this past weekend at The Roxy and been wearing out “ oil” ever since  #GoodAsHell

2712 2018-05-01 18:14:09 The US April purchasing-managers’ index showed a slight cooling in manufacturing activity that implies price increases may be tracking oil rather than increased demand. #USeco
2713 2018-05-01 18:13:53 Nahh b, thats from too much water and always add a bit of oil
2714 2018-05-01 18:13:52 Had to wash and condition it. Scalp was on fire lol love the wet hair look... no olive oil ...uugggg it’s gonna puff up lol 
2715 2018-05-01 18:13:46 Funny thing about us Californians. We like clean air, clean water and oceans/beaches not full of oil.  We’re funny like that. Love California 
2716 2018-05-01 18:13:39 so go for pure and walk deep into the woods, get lost, and find a pol who never ever got money to run.  How the hell do you think a campaign runs? On olive oil?
2717 2018-05-01 18:13:39 I got it at an auction in Carlisle recently - oil painted on wood.
2718 2018-05-01 18:13:31 Oil of Oregano is great for mold in the lungs too.
2719 2018-05-01 18:12:55 Snap back sanctions? Another Obama lie.
Now selling Boeing jets are more important than nukes? Europeans not easily going to give up trade
2720 2018-05-01 18:12:31 Changed the spark plug in the 250 and she fired right up. 
Note to self: do not over oil air filter lol
2721 2018-05-01 18:12:29 it gets them so smooth! but be aware - oil clogs the drain and i had to pay hella $$ for plumbers in my house after a few weeks of doing this in the bath (same reason you spit oil in trash not drain after oil pulling)
2722 2018-05-01 18:12:28 I’m the worst at getting oil changes. Super surprised my Jeep is even still running.

2726 2018-05-01 18:12:02 Up to 100% of female wrestlers stopped wrestling by the time WWE got their Saudi oil. A little contradicting to be supportive on this after going to a country where your own employees were forbidden to work.
2727 2018-05-01 18:12:01 That post reminds me of wrestle mania  back in its glory days .
2728 2018-05-01 18:11:54 i could’ve gotten oil changes and gas myself. i never asked for any of that. you did that all by yourself. you didn’t have to spend any money on it. but you did. i’m fine with my shitty speakers. i’m fine with my tires. i just got new ones last year actually. but yeah.
2729 2018-05-01 18:11:49 The drunk AI used the oil heater as WiTricity and felt discarded about the event.

2747 2018-05-01 18:10:11 We must build Trans Mountain, Northern Gateway, and build energy east.  We should never import an litre of oil from anywhere else again.  We should be an energy superpower, yet we are led by government of ideological fools with no vision or awareness.  Hidden agenda?

2749 2018-05-01 18:10:05 Fracking takes millions of gallons of Ohio fresh water and renders it radioactive and toxic - ODNR permits it to be injected into abandoned vertical oil wells, in Columbus there are 13 Active Frack water waste injection wells in the Columbus Watershed.  Not Good for Ohio

2753 2018-05-01 18:09:31 "Securing oil resources for the SDF" I think you have a typo Shane. SDF is a funny way to spell US.
2754 2018-05-01 18:09:31 They get mushy really quickly so I just saute them for like 5-7 minutes in avocado oil to let them soften up. It’s more like al dente pasta- not crunchy but not mushy just kinda firm. If that makes sense
2755 2018-05-01 18:09:29 You have been on fire lately, Senator. Keep it up! Unapologetic support for Medicare 4 All, basic college for young people, and environmental protection - it’s the trifecta of the future.

Pls don’t go Doug Jones on us w/ pressure from Big HC, Pharma, Oil. We need u! #Kamala2020
2756 2018-05-01 18:09:15 You like to comment on everyone’s but your own ideas. How about commenting on the PC’s  mismanagement of oil royalty revenues since the late 1980’s?  How about detailing your plans if you were to form the next government?
2757 2018-05-01 18:09:14 Imagine the advertised benefits if Keto OS and Arbonne collaborated. Seeing the insta stories already:  “New product cures cancer while inspiring users to mitigate world hunger and solve global conflict.” Would be bigger than coconut oil.

2763 2018-05-01 18:08:06 The inflation would still be happening with a capitalist government in charge. 

The key difference is that a capitalist government wouldn't be using revenue from oil sales (for starters, they'd have probably privatised the oil industry) to subsidise food for the poor.

2766 2018-05-01 18:07:56 Plenty of Canadian hemp farmers doing high cbd under the table now.  Soon they will be doing it above board.  Your excuse for not creatively competing with the snake oil scammers already is what exactly?

2786 2018-05-01 18:04:48 American economy depends on war. America has been at war every decade since WW2. There 700 military bases through out the planet. There US military is the number one buyer of gasoline (oil).

2792 2018-05-01 18:03:51 Why the need to get substantial assistance if socialism works I ask you?? That is capitalism on the face of it.. the currency is oil and they receive a service in return for the trade.. both parties profit from the exchange.
2793 2018-05-01 18:03:46 Oil... Heated at high temperature... Bursting open...
2794 2018-05-01 18:03:37 We stand on top of the world's 2nd most known reserves of oil and gas, yet pay some of the highest prices in the world for fuel.  It is only government stupidity, and greed that has created this condition.  Criminal.

2796 2018-05-01 18:03:26 The good news is that the US still has a lot of oil reserves; granted, they only make economic sense if oil prices are really high, but if this happens, they will be.
2797 2018-05-01 18:03:02 Ahhh I see so like Vaseline brand lotion for facelr cocoa butter, thanks.

2802 2018-05-01 18:02:27 Steve, we disagree on timing and are therefore spineless muppets you win! So how does one join the illicit and spined non-muppet brigade of snake oil salesmen 4 months before legalization?  And what are the long run prospects for spined non muppets 12-18 months out ?
2803 2018-05-01 18:02:21 And the fact that "its" oil resources come from Biafra, which was forcibly joined to Nigeria to enable transport of oil from noncoastal Biafra to Nigerian coastal export to the UK. Nigeria (with weapons from the UK and the US) have managed to kill/starve a lot of Biafrans for oil

2806 2018-05-01 18:01:57 In real terms, our economy didnt grow so much on other fronts in that time. We still rely solely on oil. Entered recession a couple of years back when barrel prices crashed, just 'came out' recently

2814 2018-05-01 18:01:11 Oil and vinegar carafe (sp?) for dressing salads I think. Olive oil goes in bigger part, vinegar (usually balsamic) goes in smaller part.

2820 2018-05-01 18:00:58 Does that come with 1970's oil prices? As long as we are tied to the petrodollar, Saudi Arabia and OPEC what you mentioned means nothing for the average bear.

2847 2018-05-01 17:58:37 Trump is a snake oil salesman-he knows the sheeple will hear his 2-3 word buzz phrases and assume they’re true. They certainly don’t read the New York Times. Jesus we’re in deep shit
2848 2018-05-01 17:58:29 I learned alot! It was very informative! Love that Malaysian palm oil is environmentally friendly, Non GMO and is a way more healthier than any other oil around! Thanks again for all the wonderful tips and info! #Malaysianpalmoil #sweepstakes #PalmOilHealth
2849 2018-05-01 17:58:14 This is only because USA cities are designed around cars. Look outside this country to places in Europe or Japan where you would never need a car to raise a family. Here in the USA we have bent over backwards to the automobile and oil industry to force car dependence on everyone
2850 2018-05-01 17:58:11 A5 also Palm oil’s vitamin E form is up to 60 times more potent than the more common vitamin E form found in multivitamins. How awesome is that #MalaysianPalmOil #sweepstakes #PalmOilHealth
2851 2018-05-01 17:57:58 If i run that distance you'll literally need to funnel oil down my throat for my rusty creaky joints. Am so unfit wow...I sit down to pee coz it's less seconds standing...oh, turns out am also lazy
2852 2018-05-01 17:57:43 I literally use garlic infused oil in everything, it's amazing!

2855 2018-05-01 17:57:26 I was just showing everyone your new website. And if there's nothing on it then it's the same as your personality. Blank and empty. Thanks for the concern but some of us have been able to hold down the same  job for 27 years, without having to be a snake oil salesman
2856 2018-05-01 17:57:18 Ass kissers and brown nosing ladder climbers who have no real talent or abilities applicable to the job.
2857 2018-05-01 17:57:13 A5: high smoking point with makes it a great cooking oil, high levels of vitamin E and that it  is substainable plus it’s not a top food allergen  #momsmeet #sweepstakes #MalaysianPalmOil #healthyfats
2858 2018-05-01 17:57:09  That sucks man!! I work I claims and see it everyday but it always sucks more when it happens to you.  Get some rest!
2859 2018-05-01 17:57:08 Also, oil shipping goes to shit so gas is $5 a gallon, and the US Army is near-collapse due to a decade and a half of constant deployments and overextension.
2860 2018-05-01 17:57:04 A5; i have learned today that Malaysian palm oil is very sustainable , full of healthy beneficial nutrients and versatile can be used for high heat cooking or raw in salads. #MalaysianPalmOil

2870 2018-05-01 17:56:26 I am just sick of dumbfuck #ValleyBros spouting random bullshit. I’ve had enough of this fool’s snake oil so muted him long back, hence didn’t see this on the day he tweeted. Today saw this in someone’s quote-tweet on my timeline and was like “FFS NOT AGAIN”. He’s a charlatan.

2876 2018-05-01 17:55:56 Crude oil nicely fading to the downside . $SCO $DWT vs $UCO $WTI

2878 2018-05-01 17:55:48 What is cooking? US crude oil selling off, down 2.5%. Bye bye for $70 for now.
2879 2018-05-01 17:55:45 A5- That Oil palm trees don’t need to be cleared and replanted every year which is great for the environment and wildlife!!   #MalaysianPalmOil #sweepstakes #palmoilhealth
2880 2018-05-01 17:55:37 Whassa difference between sesame oil and gingely oil?
2881 2018-05-01 17:55:34 It's a pity you can't get a product called Lipidol cleansing face oil works very well in the past for people with similar issues as you seem to have. The product has been discontinued in the world and is only available in my country.
2882 2018-05-01 17:55:32 A5 Palm oil’s vitamin E form is up to 60 times more potent than the more common vitamin E form found in your multivitamin. #MalaysianPalmOil #sweepstakes

2889 2018-05-01 17:54:53 A5 Oil palm trees don’t need to be cleared and replanted every year as with corn, canola and soybean crops.#MalaysianPalmOil #sweepstakes

2892 2018-05-01 17:54:46 Blaming Alberta Energy as Robyn Allan did doesn’t explain the high fuel prices elsewhere in North America. There’s not enough pipeline capacity and they won’t expand it unless we allow them to ship oil out of a Westridge, so it’s an impasse! #StoppedKM
2893 2018-05-01 17:54:40 *environment at risk, people sick*
DONALD TRUMP: “Gonna give oil companies financial hardship waiver.”

2894 2018-05-01 17:54:37 I covered myself in tanning oil only to come back inside bc of the millions of wasps in my backyard 
2895 2018-05-01 17:54:30 Ask for lidocaine! Your doctor can prescribe it and it's cheap. Honey helps, as does coconut oil.
2896 2018-05-01 17:54:16 Take it easy and make sure you're not injured.
2897 2018-05-01 17:54:16 I’m not floored about the clinical studies I’ve seen on MCT oil but I keep hearing great things from people who take it. Do you have any experience with it?
2898 2018-05-01 17:54:15 I don’t even use sun screen I use oil and that shit is SPF 0 
2899 2018-05-01 17:54:13 @nutiva your butter flavour coconut oil is the perfect alternative, but cut the unnecessary ingredients. Especially the palm oil. Less is more with your consumers! 
2900 2018-05-01 17:54:02 Last question! Q5: What is the most interesting thing you learned today about Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil? #MalaysianPalmOil #sweepstakes
2901 2018-05-01 17:53:20 Drilling for oil is boring.
2902 2018-05-01 17:53:17 be careful who you call out of touch!  EVs are the answer and the future. burning oil to run cars is old news. 

driving an air polluting auto is truly out of touch.
2903 2018-05-01 17:53:12 Ok oil change done, ate some pancakes with my Canadian maple syrup that's already like half gone, now off to get my #CSOI shirt made
2904 2018-05-01 17:52:47 How so? Low income families receive a carbon tax rebate. It’s more likely you’re just sweating because your rich oil friends are growling in your ear.
2905 2018-05-01 17:52:17 i don’t feel like waiting on no damn oil change man 
2906 2018-05-01 17:52:13 Jesus, how much peanut oil do use to slick back that greased up mop you call your hair?
2907 2018-05-01 17:52:12 I’ve got coconut oil on my hair, a pomegranate mask on my face and my lunch is being prepped as we speak. Who am I?!
2908 2018-05-01 17:52:08 Oil also looks nice here
2909 2018-05-01 17:52:05 
2910 2018-05-01 17:51:59 what was the consensus on the beard oil?  I'm in the market....

2912 2018-05-01 17:51:54 The EPA, Canceled a requirement for oil and gas companies to report methane emission. In March of 2017, Republican officials from 11 states wrote a letter to Mr. Pruitt, saying the rule added costs & paperwork for oil and gas companies. The next day, Mr. Pruitt revoked the rule.
2913 2018-05-01 17:51:46 Some of you guys don’t know how to fight change oil or nuthn all you niggauhs do is drugs and cry  no wonder y’all girls leave y’all se pasan de verga
2914 2018-05-01 17:51:38 Thatcher rode the back of the North Sea oil boom like a seaside donkey, using it to mask her insanity and incompetence

2923 2018-05-01 17:50:56 GRAIN LOVE! Greek olive oil, white or red wine vinegar, a hint of balsamic vinegar, mixed herbs, Maggi seasoning, and GRAIN mustard. Yum.
2924 2018-05-01 17:50:55 I’ve noticed a few companies lately launching new hair masks that are pure coconut oil and they have a high price tag. Can’t you just pick up a jar of coconut oil for like $8 and use it on your hair, skin, nail, etc. i mean correct me if I’m wrong but...
2925 2018-05-01 17:50:48 Sneaking in a deal about shipping oil to Asia in massive oil tankers through densely populated Metro Vancouver with the pipeline twinning just stinks for BC, for Vancouver and all the folks that have worked hard to live near the coast that’s being threatened by oil spills.
2926 2018-05-01 17:50:31 Wow, that is amazing! Glad that this oil is producing more but in smaller spaces that leaves room for other agriculture to thrive! #MalaysianPalmOil #PalmOilHealth
2927 2018-05-01 17:50:28 Hope you are talking about your truck...otherwise..think you posted on the wrong app
2928 2018-05-01 17:50:02 Oil palm trees don’t need to be cleared and replanted every year as with corn, canola and soybean crops. This results in significantly less environmental impact, as well as stable homes for native wildlife. #MalaysianPalmOil #PalmOilHealth
2929 2018-05-01 17:49:59 I wish I looked like a ball of oil
2930 2018-05-01 17:49:42 Sounds like a good Tuesday to me!
2931 2018-05-01 17:49:41 Or the global crash, or the international oil market, or the embargos/political interference of outsiders, or the replacement of a popular leader w/ an inferior, corrupt & seemingly incompetent successor.
Fact is, it's more complicated than ppl make it to score political points.

2936 2018-05-01 17:49:15 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
2937 2018-05-01 17:49:07 That article even points out the main cause of economic problems in Venezuela; The oil price collapse in 2013/14 decimated the value of 95% exports.

VZLA has been dependent on oil for most of the past century, the cause of their current woes goes back a lot further than Chavez.
2938 2018-05-01 17:49:06 I never knew palm oil was so amazing #MalaysianPalmOil #PalmOilHealth
2939 2018-05-01 17:49:06 Possibly, but the increase is noticeable. If the oil companies are rounding that up on top of that, then shame on them.
2940 2018-05-01 17:49:03 According to your product info, your crisps are “kosher”. What does this mean in terms of crisps, sold in the UK,  that include only sunflower oil, potatoes and salt?
2941 2018-05-01 17:48:55 You only need to @KTTape 1-2 times per week; it'll last for a few days, even with showering, if you apply it right. You know I've got all the Islander-girl-skin-oil make-it-stick tricks! It's great for active support, not just running but yoga too, and if you wear heels at work.
2942 2018-05-01 17:48:53 I notice when I use a certain oil it became rancid when the the oil  was too hot. #MalaysianPalmOil #Sweepstakes #PalmOilHealth

2945 2018-05-01 17:48:35 Many relatively modern cars (well, as a starting point, E39s – so '96 on) have an oil level warning system – hence that approach. VAG stuff, for example, has a single oil light but amber indicates level issues and red a pressure issue. Still prefer to check mine regularly.

2947 2018-05-01 17:48:23 We gotta swing by target when you get back, need tanning oil and a bathing suit
2948 2018-05-01 17:48:23 A4. Do you have any sources indicating that Malaysian Palm Oil is sustainable, protecting wildlife as they claim that aren’t from the Palm Oil industry? @ChrisGPackham @greenpeaceusa @GreenpeaceUK
2949 2018-05-01 17:48:19 BOOO! You ok?

2951 2018-05-01 17:48:16 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
2952 2018-05-01 17:48:16 Red America won't buy what they are selling.

2958 2018-05-01 17:48:00 Palm oil is the most efficient oil crop. In Malaysia, a one acre oil palm plantation produces 11 times more oil than an acre of soybean, 10 times more than sunflower & 7 times more than canola! #MalaysianPalmOil #PalmOilHealth
2959 2018-05-01 17:47:48 Comrade, do you consider Nigeria to be a shit-hole country or does having oil elevate the nation to a higher category?

2975 2018-05-01 17:45:54 Just read on your site  Malaysian palm oil is a food industry favorite because of its quality, wholesomeness and versatility. It’s non-GMO and nutritious, delivers a creamy texture and long shelf life, plus it’s responsibly produced. I LOVE IT !! #PalmOilHealth #MalaysianPalmOil

2985 2018-05-01 17:44:32 It's just completely bad optics for his previous party and hypocritical. Look at what he said when Dwayne Lingenfelter took a job in Calgary. Or his railing against Rachel Notley. Or his trying to get oil companies to move to Saskatchewan. Student retention.

2994 2018-05-01 17:43:16 I remember a somewhat perplexed green-eyed ESTJ oil heiress, flipping her long and silky tresses over a blue denim bandolier, rabidly feeds a handful of arrowwood to a generally laid back Basque mountain horse.

You cannot built a trillion dollar refinery and then still compete with global oil prices. Economically non-viable.

It is said that we are clay and return to dust in the fullness of time. Yet time is merely oil spilled upon water. It coagulates and separates in endless designs until leviathans from the depths are given form by the spectrum captured in its psychedelic essence.
3104 2018-05-01 17:32:45 Of course Shell supports a carbon tax. The carbon tax distributes the externalized cost of oil across Canadian taxpayers, when the externalized costs should be delivered directly to the party that profits: Shell.

Since when are we taking BIG BUSINESS' advice on anything?
3105 2018-05-01 17:32:43 If we’re going to talk about the tax let’s also talk about the erroneous price gouging from the oil companies that are holding this country hostage. Another 12 cents sucks, but so does a $1 - 2 bogus price increase that always happens for no reason.

3110 2018-05-01 17:32:20 A3. Reading the label. Always try to eat healthy   I don’t buy anything that has hydrogenated oil #sweepstakes #MalaysianPalmOil
3111 2018-05-01 17:32:20 Oil is not worthless. BUT there is virtually no tax income from oil because oil companies have expenses to set against tax and tax rates are low - because Osborne acceded to Swinney's entreaties to slash tax on oil companies.
3112 2018-05-01 17:32:19 As someone who attempted to major in Psychology I can attest to it's inefficacy. I've honestly never sat through as many BS and pseudo-scientific lectures as I did in those years. Never a more corrupt and depraved industry have I ever seen, snake oil salesmen the lot.
3113 2018-05-01 17:32:10 Yeah lol, I noticed that although it left my hair feeling super soft, the moisture from my scalp was all gone. And honestly whatever moisturizer I could find, but usually they’re water based products, my hair doesn’t like oil too much
3114 2018-05-01 17:32:09 Palm oil contains almost equal amounts of unsaturated fats and saturated fats. This balance is what makes it healthier than other saturated fats. #MalaysianPalmOil #PalmOilHealth

3130 2018-05-01 17:30:27 A world cup is going to be played in qatar and many companies get their oil from the gulf states. Even if their were no states companies would still ally themselves with the gulf states.
3131 2018-05-01 17:30:23 @MelodyThomasSco You oil GLORIOUS in that coral dress! What a great color for you! 
3132 2018-05-01 17:30:11 getting my oil changed makes me feel like a powerful adult woman
3133 2018-05-01 17:30:10 Notice Trump has been avoiding citing the "record" stock market gains the past two months...and the impact of his irresponsible trade and tax policies is only starting to be felt.  Oil will go up dramatically in 2 weeks when Trump walks away from the Iran deal

3138 2018-05-01 17:29:45 It's a state run oil company with proceeds going to fund public services. Not all interactions with a market are pure capitalism. This is what modern socialist democracies are about: mixed economies with well regulated markets where they make sense.
3139 2018-05-01 17:29:36 Man be careful what you wish for because I might spend hours on it. Short answer though, Hideki Suzuki couldn’t oil Package’s traps. -drew

3141 2018-05-01 17:29:30 Oh wow I can’t wait to try this oil even more now! #MalaysianPalmOil #sweepstakes
3142 2018-05-01 17:29:28 Okay but thats just a remote possibility. Its a fact that pipelines are the safest way to transport fuels like oil and lng, so really Reds protest, by diverting that supply to other modes of transpo, is causing the risk of an incident to increase.
3143 2018-05-01 17:29:27 Insecurity seeking acceptance. Creates a clique atmosphere btwn those that care and those with a real life just trying to do the job

3146 2018-05-01 17:28:53 I had my oil changed, and as I was turning into the main road my brakes didn’t work; almost hit a car until I pulled the E-brake. 

They looked underneath and claimed my break lines failed “of no fault of ours. See? Rust!” as he violently stabbed my break lines.
3147 2018-05-01 17:28:53 anyone get the feeling that you can be toxic but only towards yourself and the only thing you can do is put on a face mask, bathe in coconut oil and drink tea but nothing helps?¿ 

bc same.

3151 2018-05-01 17:28:29 6 And I heard a #voice in the midst of the four #beasts say, A measure of #wheat for a #penny, and three measures of #barley for a #penny; and see thou hurt not the #oil and the #wine.
3152 2018-05-01 17:28:28 Wow, what do they do with the rest of the fruit after they extract the oil? #MalaysianPalmOil #PalmOilHealth #HealthyOil
3153 2018-05-01 17:28:26 Do not listen to the warmongers.
There is no good reason to attack Iran, unless you believe that oil, dollars, profits and other US interests are more important than human beings.
#Netanyahu is a big fat warmonger
3154 2018-05-01 17:28:23 Part of it, yes! And Big Oil, Lockheed, Raytheon, Halliburton, British Aerospace, and Mr Netanyahu.
3155 2018-05-01 17:28:16 A2 I just want my oil to be healthy, and that means no carcinogens at high temperatures! #MalaysianPalmOil #sweepstakes

3168 2018-05-01 17:27:02 So disappointed in #MomsMeet. They have such wonderful parties and great informative parties but not this time. Encouraging people to buy Palm Oil while orangutans suffer and our rain forests are being burnt to the ground is heartbreaking
3169 2018-05-01 17:26:56 It has always been no more than excuses Jim. If opposed Indy when oil revs at max. their opposition to Indy had nothing to do with economics. Even least well-informed knew there was "a lot" of oil
3170 2018-05-01 17:26:45 I like how all those companies have big offices here (yay off-shore), and then the local government hires IHS Markit to do the study in the oil refinery here for future sale next year.
3171 2018-05-01 17:26:42 “This package isn’t from an oil lobbyist! What is it doing here?!”

3175 2018-05-01 17:26:20 And then for gels: eco (black castor oil line) kinky curly custard, Eden (I think that’s the name ) coconut curl gel. Once again.... less is more. Always apply to damp hair.
3176 2018-05-01 17:26:14 Just be glad it’s only a photo. What if mom insisted on capturing you two in an oil painting? Weeks of posing for hours. Same clothes every day.
3177 2018-05-01 17:26:02 Malaysian sustainable palm oil is #nongmo. Plus, it’s a naturally balanced oil! #MalaysianPalmOil #PalmOilHealth

3185 2018-05-01 17:25:23 Don’t forget to scrub and oil up your body y’all
3186 2018-05-01 17:25:14 ...which can cause it to think it needs to produce more oil!
3187 2018-05-01 17:25:11 This man thinks only his way is right.He never trust others to do their job by their own way.A full-blooded dictator.He wants oil subsidy so d rich can enjoy traveling more by their luxurious cars.He hates BRIM because that benefit d poor. @NajibRazak @n_izzah @ZainudinMaidin
3188 2018-05-01 17:25:06 ปวดไปทั้งตัวเลยตอนนี้
3189 2018-05-01 17:25:04 You sound like a shill for the oil companies, and a true denier of science.  If you are not for zero emissions, and a return to pre-industrial CO2 levels, you are for AGW and all the destruction that has already taken place!
3190 2018-05-01 17:25:03 Moslems have no choice, if they don't they loose their head for leaving Islam,  Muslims are leaving Islam by the millions , check the Ex-Muslims tweets or web sites..   British imperialism is the main reason for Islam's existence after finding oil in the middle east.
3191 2018-05-01 17:25:03 Grocery bag ripped and the whole bag dropped with a bottle of oil. Yeah that shit is a mess now.
3192 2018-05-01 17:24:59 Sounds daft but do you use oils in your skincare at the mo?   My skin used to be stupidly oily and I used ‘foaming’ cleansers and ‘mattifying’ things but I now use more oil based cleansers, double cleanse at night, I don’t avoid moisturiser etc.  Your skin might be dehydrated...

3196 2018-05-01 17:24:02 #MalaysianPalmOil is a natural replacement for partially hydrogenated oil. #PalmOilHealth
3197 2018-05-01 17:23:57 This oil diffuser is bomb! About nap really good.
3198 2018-05-01 17:23:52 All companies should make the switch to palm oil. #MalaysianPalmOil #PalmOilHealth #sweepstakes

3201 2018-05-01 17:23:36 Look like newly minted Sec of State Mike Pompeo will restore Foggy Bottom to pre Rex Tillerson days ... Operation Exxon Mobil $600 billion oil deal in Russia failed and he called Trump a moron so he had to go
3202 2018-05-01 17:23:32 Oil looking HEAVY
3203 2018-05-01 17:23:13 I wondered who put tiliapia on your corn flakes this morning. Makes sense now. 

I like salt and lemon pepper on mine. Cooked in some olive oil in a pan. Side of asparagus and cremini mushrooms sautéed with garlic and seasoned salt. I know what I want for dinner now.
3204 2018-05-01 17:23:11 I stay otp with my parents when I’m getting a oil change or sum cus mfs be trying it.
3205 2018-05-01 17:22:57 A lot of manufacturers use palm oil b/c it’s cheap and shelf stable too.
3206 2018-05-01 17:22:42 Is this another twitter oil 
3207 2018-05-01 17:22:40 Take the over
3208 2018-05-01 17:22:38 Pake yg lain dulu deh, kayak freeman acv, haple almond oil
3209 2018-05-01 17:22:34 Asking for a friend, if the oil change might came on 2 weeks ago how much longer can the car go before it really needs one?
3210 2018-05-01 17:22:31 I prayed with a man on his death bed, today. Annointed him with oil. The maker & the eternity He made stretch on before us all, and our great & only peparation to meet Him is faith in Christ, the Lamb of God who bears away the sin of the word.
3211 2018-05-01 17:22:22 Hmph. Seems so challenging to get ‘non-invested’ info regarding this topic.  Malaysia is ‘weaker’ but without delving much further, b/c you’re promoting S. American Palm Oil 
3212 2018-05-01 17:22:21 Changed the oil on both trucks, gas tank filled up on both trucks, now I just need to get a new transmission pan & I’m gravy
3213 2018-05-01 17:22:16 A lot of manufacturers use palm oil instead of partially hydrogenated oils because hydrogenated oils are the primary source of trans fats in our diets. They’ve been shown to increase heart disease, diabetes & stroke risk. #MalaysianPalmOil #PalmOilHealth
3214 2018-05-01 17:22:03 Oh right, what do you do with the oil though? I've got persistent rhinitis, i'm basically allergic to dust & antihistamines don't do anything to help
3215 2018-05-01 17:21:51 Happy Birthday @IamDrSID 

Sending  and accolades all the way from the oil city!!!
3216 2018-05-01 17:21:36 Yes! At being a Flim flam man, confidence and serial bankruptcy artist, ponsi-pyramid marketing fake, money laundering bully and adulterous lying snake oil salesman.

3218 2018-05-01 17:21:33 A 3.4-magnitude earthquake was reported on Tuesday morning in Karnes County by the U.S. Geological Survey. the 3.4-magnitude quake hit just off Highway 181 near Hobson Oil Field around 11:30 a.m. The earthquake had a depth of 5 km, which is a shallow quake. No rptd injuries

Delighted that the Revd Canon Andi Hofbauer from St. Aidan's  Harehills, is coming to lead us as we dwell in God's presence and have the opportunity to be prayed for, and anointed with, oil. @andihofb 

All are very welcome.
3228 2018-05-01 17:20:52 No trans fats and something that’s gut healthy. Things like canola oil wreck my stomach. So it’s important that it has not only great flavor, but also not a burden on the belly lol...
3229 2018-05-01 17:20:45 The palm oil’s high smoking point of 450F is great for frying and can be reused a few more times for us #frugalmoms #momsmeet #MalaysianPalmOil #goodfats
3230 2018-05-01 17:20:27 Thanks for sharing this crucial information. I always use olive oil. That’s it. I am switching to palm oil #MalaysianPalmOil #sweepstakes #PalmOilHealth
3231 2018-05-01 17:20:25 If the steak is oiled I wouldn’t imagine you’d need to oil the pan, seems overkill, unless you’ve under oiled the steak
3232 2018-05-01 17:20:11 A blood transfusion is a human oil change
3233 2018-05-01 17:20:08 I fell asleep with oil on and it’s not okay. I’m not okay.
3234 2018-05-01 17:20:03 Palm oil is a fruit oil that comes from a special species of palm tree which only grows nears the equator. Palm oil is released when the fruitlets are squeezed, similar to olive oil. #Healthyoil #PalmOilHealth #MalaysianPalmOil

3238 2018-05-01 17:19:48 BamBam is one girl I admire. She turned all the hate to success. In one month she has launched her own oil line, is a brand ambassador, has done various shoots, appeared on the cover of a magazine, has a role in a major film etc. She's on a roll & i wish Cee-C the same #BBNaija
3239 2018-05-01 17:19:43 This is crazy, didn’t know that. So just use it as a dressing oil then? #MalaysianPalmOil #PalmOilHealth

3241 2018-05-01 17:19:35 I'm a Sabbatical Beauty convert. My night routine is usually their oil wash, then I've been using Cerave after. Then a bunch of serums: one called Asian Powerhouse, another called Marine--these together have cleared up sunspots.
3242 2018-05-01 17:19:33 @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @mike_pence remind us how many $MILLIONS the $billionaire oil companies got in #TRumptaxscam & why gas prices are rising almost daily?  Ditto groceries. Small businesses praising #GOPTaxScam are also raising their prices? GREEDY buggers
3243 2018-05-01 17:19:27 Defiantly i only use olive oil for salads.
3244 2018-05-01 17:19:26 Actually he’s right. The rest of the country translates hot chicken into cayenne in the breading, or generally spicy chicken. Almost no one does the fry oil + cayenne sauce and that’s key. It’s not hard either, you can do it at home and get the same results.
3245 2018-05-01 17:19:23 Green bonds #greenbonds are enabling investors to move from oil and coal to green. Last year got to $150 Billion. Why? Because it makes sense. But we need to get to around $1 Trillion in financial investments in green economy to have significant impact. @CFigueres #CollisionConf
3246 2018-05-01 17:19:21 You know literally nothing about oil to claim its purely western companies
3247 2018-05-01 17:19:14 When will oil be ready for sale?
3248 2018-05-01 17:19:12 Tim Eaton's brilliant paper. Highlights that fuel smuggling has cost #Libya at least $9bn since 2012, more than the 2017 budget deficit ($7.85bn) and double 2016 oil revenues ($4.8bn).
3249 2018-05-01 17:19:05 I have heard alot about palm oil and how harvesting it kills rain forest.  Can you give me info on that

3251 2018-05-01 17:18:59 @drsanjaygupta  Hello Dr. Gupta.. I am 84 years old and I have lupus as well as severe arthritis..I want to try cannabis oil but I have read online that it should not be taken if you are on aspirin.. I take one 81 mg. aspirin daily.  What are your thoughts on this?
3252 2018-05-01 17:18:55 There's a oil paiting 120cx90cm I need to do but I'm so scared I can't even start it.
3253 2018-05-01 17:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
3254 2018-05-01 17:18:22 I was super skeptical about this rosehip seed oil but the red marks are actually clearing up and now I’m mad cause this shit costs $36
3255 2018-05-01 17:18:20 That is a huge plus. and i love that this oil has a lot of energy boosting properties. #MalaysianPalmOil
3256 2018-05-01 17:18:13 In my opinion, if you’re going to be wearing open toed shoes you need to put on lotion....baby oil or something!
3257 2018-05-01 17:18:11 I love being an adult and paying for an oil change 
3258 2018-05-01 17:18:02 It is insane! I’m currently in Vancouver where gas is always expensive but this is crazy. I thought Calgary was bad enough at $1.30 right now! What’s crazy about Alberta prices is we have oil in our province!
3259 2018-05-01 17:17:54 Olive oil is great for low-heat cooking, but you should never cook it above 380 degrees. It can become a carcinogenic at high heat. #MalaysianPalmOil #PalmOilHealth
3260 2018-05-01 17:17:42 Especially considering most are White, living lives cloaked in privilege they can't scrape off or wash away. Self loathing pitiful ppl.

3269 2018-05-01 17:16:43 According to Fasoye, “Every state is supposed to get its own share of the extra dollars on the sales of oil in the country, but the FG is not giving the state its due allocation”
3270 2018-05-01 17:16:36 Mark Zuckerberg falls as cost pressures rise, oil prices retreat
3271 2018-05-01 17:16:31 But since you bring up oil refineries, journalists get this wrong, too.  As when they talk about the volume of profits at oil majors and never ask how much investment is required to generate those profits.
3272 2018-05-01 17:16:24 With the worst life expectancy rate of all the oil producing countries. With worst police in the world. With worst healthcare system that our own president went away to treat ear infection. We are indeed cheap.

3277 2018-05-01 17:16:06 Also, bilge dumping from boats is one of the biggest causes of ocean pollution.  Millions of gallons worth of oil and fuels annually. If that hasn’t killed us at our beaches or killed off our fisheries yet, I highly doubt that some treated effluent will do any more harm.

3287 2018-05-01 17:15:21 Examine your engine oil level at least once a week or more if you do high mileage.
3288 2018-05-01 17:15:14 Palm oil is perfect for frying, sautéing, & other high-heat cooking. It’s amazing because it doesn’t lose its nutritional value once heated. It’s smoke point is in excess of 450 degrees. #MalaysianPalmOil #PalmOilHealth

Me: It's almost like oil prices rise and fall and never stay low forever. 
90%: But our trucks and SUVs are so appealing to us. Why should we ever think about global markets?

3294 2018-05-01 17:14:37 @realDonaldTrump Steel along with coal, oil, and lumber are great avenues for the USA to be able to help bring people from other countries up while leveling the playing field for those at home. Not tariffs but wage requirements and verifications similar to Davis-Bacon but global.
3295 2018-05-01 17:14:37 Now image that view with oil wells in it.  Zinke would be ecstatic.

3298 2018-05-01 17:14:07 Psa.92:10 Says we need Fresh Oil. Oil speaks of anointing. It was used to pour or sprinkle on everything used in worship to God in the tabernacle and temple. Three things happen when we are anointed.1-Sets us apart. 2- Supernatural ability3-Empowered. Ask God today for fresh oil.
3299 2018-05-01 17:14:05 You are incorrect! Show us the PROOF! Stop believing the LYING Main Stream News. Just like when NetanYAHOO said Iraq had WMD's & U.S. would be greeted as liberators! It's all about $ to put pipeline thru Syria & STEAL Golan Heights Oil. See Genie Energy!

3301 2018-05-01 17:13:50 The subsidies, grants & loans, the #dirtyindustry of oil & gas, were handed by the government - VIA THE TAXPAYERS - is acceptable, then?
3302 2018-05-01 17:13:40 I think they're rightly concerned both that the FIA may respond (especially if gained through, for instance, oil burning), and competing OEMs might be more motivated if they know how far behind they are

Plus, customers like McLaren don't want it known how bad their chassis is...

3304 2018-05-01 17:13:08 Malaysian palm oil is a great addition to any chef’s kitchen. You may have trouble finding it on the shelf of your favorite store, but it’s definitely available online. We like Carotino oil, available on Amazon.  #MalaysianPalmOil #PalmOilHealth

3319 2018-05-01 17:11:49 Obama & Kerry just wanted a deal. They gave Iran billions with cash & oil sales being lifted.

Did Iran change their nuclear ambition behavior?

3321 2018-05-01 17:11:35 The most positive spin I can put on this is some poorly informed ignorant  @canada govt official made the decision -  it should be reversed immediately - more likely answer is oil money speaks louder than human rights. May I be wrong.
3322 2018-05-01 17:11:02 Who thinks they can help me fix and oil leak in my car? 200$
3323 2018-05-01 17:10:53 First and foremost, we should invest in productive ventures, expand output driven by foreign and domestic demand, build an aqueduct to California, open new mines, oil refineries, etc. And adjust infrastructure accordingly. But your thinking is good, Madam Ivanka.
3324 2018-05-01 17:10:50 A1 No I have never tried Palm Oil but I am very interested now! #MalaysianPalmOil #PalmOilHealth #sweepstakes

3326 2018-05-01 17:10:48 Why bacteria easily infected? Bcoz our skin ph level is compromised. So must always find a way to balance your ph 5.5. Balanced moisture (water) & oil on your skin means it looking healthy & hydrated not too oily not too kering and dull.
3327 2018-05-01 17:10:43 Thank you! Not heard of using thyme and oregano oil, what do they do? 
3328 2018-05-01 17:10:41 Hectares aren't a sole measure for comparative harm here. Palm oil's problem is where it is, & even that 3% is disastrous, for many reasons. Big business has a lot to answer for here, & demand for food that needs little or no prep. /2

3356 2018-05-01 17:07:38 And also breakouts are due to clogged pores & congested skin which due to alot of reasons mostly from our own oil sebum & wrg products used, if got the pus aka pimple, means its alrdy infected by bacteria.
3357 2018-05-01 17:07:31 Is there no place safe from exploitation?  Here in Colorado people have oil and gas rigs in their back yards.  Not their rigs, mind you.  They belong to corporations taking advantage of long-standing mineral right reservations.
3358 2018-05-01 17:07:29 US don't need to buy our oil before we survive my dear, there were countries without oil and are doing well all we need do is having good people who are selfless as leaders.
3359 2018-05-01 17:07:26 The Trump administration must be stopped from increasing leases to oil, gas, coal, & timber industries.
3360 2018-05-01 17:07:26 Steel along with coal, oil, and lumber are great avenues for the USA to be able to help bring people from other countries up while leveling the playing field for those at home. Look at not tariffs but wage requirements and verifications similar to Davis-Bacon but on global scale.
3361 2018-05-01 17:07:19 Thanks to Malaysia’s groundbreaking national certification program, 100% of its palm oil will be certified sustainable by the end of 2019. #MalaysianPalmOil #HealthyOil

3381 2018-05-01 17:05:06 Under @realDonaldTrump my paycheck saw the first real increase in 3 years. Now, thanks to exploding gas prices, that increase will go to fund profits for big oil. Giveth and taketh away I guess...

3393 2018-05-01 17:04:07 Can state govt pay this without owning all their workers ?
Can dis federal govt pay this also when we depend solely on oil revenue?
If 50000 minimum wage comes to reality how do govt intend to control inflation in d society?

3399 2018-05-01 17:03:40 Admittedly there has been deforestation for soy for animal feed in Brazil, and oil palm may need comparatively few hectares compared with soy & rape, but it seems the last two are more versatile, soil & climate wise, & deforestation isn't 100% necessary. /1

3401 2018-05-01 17:03:28 Multivitamins can be very hit-or-miss for sure... We take: Fish oil, Vitamin C, and Vitamin D, and that's it as far as actual vitamins go. I have a real sensitive tummy but those ones don't seem to bother me, which is yay XD

3403 2018-05-01 17:03:13 Been thinking a lot about that thread about clocking abusers, esp the point about kindness vs. niceness. 

Any fool can act nice, and often will bc being nice helps you get your way and oil interpersonal interactions. 

Being selectively nice is a great way to isolate ppl too.
3404 2018-05-01 17:03:09 They are truly disgusting. No morality whatsoever. 

This is what we should@be fighting to stop. 

Instead our armies fight for oil, territory, and for Israel.
3405 2018-05-01 17:03:03 Palm oil is the world’s most widely consumed vegetable oil. In 2018, Malaysia was the first to produce and export sustainable palm oil! #MalaysianPalmOil #PalmOilHealth
3406 2018-05-01 17:03:01 Hahahahahaha he is a spoiled boy. Gets a rotation of grain free domestic crunchies, rotates between duck, lamb and fish. With regularly greenies streets. Gets to lick the coconut oil off my hands when I use it as moisturizer too.
3407 2018-05-01 17:02:56 Canada suffers additional losses in other sectors. For example, more oil is being shipped by rail because of pipeline constraints and this is reducing capacity for farmers to get grain to market.
3408 2018-05-01 17:02:52 You forgot:  "The chief driver of what you pay at the pump is the per barrel price of oil?" and a quote from AAA
3409 2018-05-01 17:02:41 OIL DIFF: 6.45 -> 6.42
3410 2018-05-01 17:02:31 Do you think this makes you sound smart?  Do you think that there are a lot of fixed assets tied to a newpaper business????  We're not talking about an oil refinery here.  If you look at Gannett, their SE is 1.3x their sales, so you're really making a distinction without a diff,
3411 2018-05-01 17:02:19 I'm mad that I still have to buy rice and vinegar. I can make my own sugar, flour, and oil. I just want to seize the means of rice and vinegar production from Pierre. Is that so much to ask?

3413 2018-05-01 17:01:52 เจ็บช้ำด้วยความเต็มใจ
3414 2018-05-01 17:01:50 Maybe it's a difference of markets or perspective.  Slice, for ex., focuses on high end RE markets.  Most RE ppl I speak to are here in NYC which is exp.  Most other non-RE tokenization opp's I'm aware of are in IP and oil & gas, which are also pricey assets.

It's the crooks at OPEC.

They need to be exposed.

3429 2018-05-01 17:00:17 That's a somewhat simplistic and condescending answer when I've explained both why I didn't support it back in Peak Oil time and also why the economic case is only the "base case"-the first hurdle Indy supporters need to clear. Not like you to be thus-hope you are ok. Cheers.

3434 2018-05-01 16:59:42 Perry, Pruitt & Pres Trump must be stopped from destroying our environment. Oil, gas, & coal operations must be regulated to hold them responsible in event of disaster.

3449 2018-05-01 16:58:51 DO NOT GIVE UP MEAT. Horrible advice. 

Cut processed foods. 

Focus on pasture raised meat, eggs, butter & cheese, vegetables, some fruit & nuts. Go easy on grains. Avoid vegetable oil.
Eat like your great grandmother ate. 

Veganism is propaganda.

3503 2018-05-01 16:51:45 2 yrs ago the price of a barrel of oil was almost twice as much as it is now yet now we're paying more ? We're being RIPPED OFF, plain & simple.

3511 2018-05-01 16:50:58 Canada is an oil refiner. Some oil refining nations get subsidies on their gasoline, some pay 20 cents a liter. We're getting ripped off VERY badly.
3512 2018-05-01 16:50:50 Not one thing controls gas prices. It takes a few things. Conflicts, market, and rig count. Obama done something good. He stopped putting oil in our national reserve. That is why we’ve seen a steady cheaper gas price for years now. We use our own oil. It won’t go to high

Black on black grime.

3516 2018-05-01 16:50:44 I don't know how any rational human can come to the conclusion that a project "too risky" for billionaire oil men to invest in, is a good place to put public funds.

3536 2018-05-01 16:48:38 Israel isn’t an entity breeding love either.

3540 2018-05-01 16:48:05 It's a collapsed oil economy in the ass end of the middle of nowhere and I was attempting to sell a quite literally falling the fuck apart house while doing all the repairs myself. Yes, smartass. I got trapped. Also, fuck you.
3541 2018-05-01 16:48:01 At the oil change place. Seems they've locked my keys in my car, something I've never managed to do before. Let's see how they figure this out. Let's see how long they'll take.
3542 2018-05-01 16:47:43 Diversified to where? And he's still looking for oil in the northern areas. PMB just went to USA to nod his head smiling from jaw to jaw without marketing our products. Trump has put the USA trade on motion while PMB went there to smile.

3554 2018-05-01 16:46:50 So this morning I accidentally took melatonin instead of fish oil. Don’t ask me how I mixed up a tiny melatonin pill with the huge fish oil because I don’t have an answer, just pray I don’t fall asleep at my desk.

3556 2018-05-01 16:46:36 I got some vernon francois products during the VIB sale and it really hits the spot. The only thing I would previously use in my curls was jojoba oil because everything else felt wrong, especially styling products, but it feels like these VF products....GET me.

3558 2018-05-01 16:46:27 The first three are great! I wouldn't be afraid of all fats though. You need some fat to make 2 essential fatty acids your body can't make. Plus, fat helps you absorb fat-soluble vitamins. Monounsaturated fat in nuts, olive oil is a heart-healthy option.

3561 2018-05-01 16:46:00 Word. If “fried in oil & then refried in more oil” is ever wrong I don’t want to be right.
3562 2018-05-01 16:45:53 May I recommend the oil guys go get some bootstraps with which to pull themselves up? I mean, if you just GIVE it to them, they'll never really learn to take care of themselves. 
In the meantime, can we pick what they get to eat, and yell at them for having cell phones?

3578 2018-05-01 16:43:51 Organic henna, lemon juice, coffee grind, argan oil and warm water. Hair mask and hair dye. Soooo soothing my scalp thanks me.

3584 2018-05-01 16:43:16 Such bullshit! The price of crude oil dips slightly so we'll rape the wallets & purses of those who keep the money train rolling. Issue!= They have our b@!!$ in a vice b/c we HAVE  to have it. Disgusting!

3586 2018-05-01 16:42:53 Oil price direction of travel makes shorts amongst the junior rubbish bin difficult. Not a fruitful market and in any case a small opportunity set after the low oil price shakeout.

3588 2018-05-01 16:42:23 @JesseBWatters I wondered why Macron was against ending Iran deal. Did some research & discovered Total S.A., partly owned by govt of France, cut deal with Iran in July 2017 worth $4.8 billion to development South Pars oil/gas field in Persian Gulf. Hmmm
3589 2018-05-01 16:42:17 That would be swell. Nope no breakouts. I get stress hives but that's it. Currently all I'm doing is coconut oil to remove makeup and then warm water in the mornings
3590 2018-05-01 16:42:04 If you think gas prices are high now, just wait until Iran's oil is taken off of the market again.
3591 2018-05-01 16:41:53 Even for Conservatives this is positive, despite CPC bitching ... welcome it!  Liberals also should be thankful that the USA economy is on fire, importing loads of stuff from us and powering CDN oil/auto sectors higher. It's nothing to do with Liberal 'gender' budgets.
3592 2018-05-01 16:41:42 I was checking my oil and deadass pulled the little stick to keep the hood up right out of my car... I’m basically the Hulk.

3596 2018-05-01 16:41:27 That + he was a disaster for Oklahoma. He was warned about earthquakes etc. - just ignored them and denied the connection to oil operations. Just let it happen. Beyond Scott,Oklahoma is slowly figuring out they've elected a bunch of goons (its why the teachers recently revolted).
3597 2018-05-01 16:41:19 Mostly taxes...and some market manipulation (i.e., collusion) by the oil companies.

3604 2018-05-01 16:40:19 Bill, why are you under the impression that an Indy Scotland would get 100% of all oil and gas revenue?? I'm really curious how that would be possible.

3606 2018-05-01 16:40:10 We need to wake up before we become a third world country. Liberals give billions to Bombardier and auto industry. They are all consumers of oil products. Go figure.

3612 2018-05-01 16:39:45 Guessing they are using it as a binder because it sound good since coconut oil is the current “thing” for people.

Please be reminded that for service tonight, we are asked to walk with a bottle of olive oil and a special seed.

Don't forget to bring someone along with you to take part in this special service.

3614 2018-05-01 16:39:23 1)On an average oil drilling co requires 70-80$ price for new exploration. 2) don't think OPEC will be able to get through by production cut so long. Russia after sanctions will try to increase supply in order to overcome. 3)Iran has already started selling oil in euros rather

3621 2018-05-01 16:38:17 I saw an obese man yesterday putting 30 seconds of oil on his large bucket of popcorn, followed by 20 shakes of a salt shaker. It struck me as watching someone slowly kill themselves.
3622 2018-05-01 16:38:17 Brian two questions for you
1) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?
2) Do you think scots would be better off with the 8% of oil and gas revenue we get just now,,or with 100%?
3623 2018-05-01 16:38:15 I’m inclined to disagree, but I don’t know enough about hand oil to dispute it.

3634 2018-05-01 16:37:23 N. Sea operators are generally public companies listed on various stock exchanges. Each operator usually has other companies as partners in the oil fields being developed or operated. Apart from having to obtain licences from UKGov, operators are responsible for managing fields.

3667 2018-05-01 16:33:05 Resign or return to the mission of EPA. It is not to reward the oil, gas, mining, & timber industries by leasing land & offshore. These are public lands & public coastlines that should be protected from industry development. Pristine areas are treasures for future generations.

3670 2018-05-01 16:32:50 #oil industry gears up for deep water/ HPHT projects viable between $35-40 a barrel. Efficiency and cost optimisation will remain key to growth, a costly learning from less than $30 a barrel,though speculation rife that price to touch $ 100 @worldpetroleum @IHS_news

3672 2018-05-01 16:32:18 Data as oil. An utterly misleading and broken, yet unfortunately widely spread analogy/metaphor.
3673 2018-05-01 16:32:12 FYI the price of oil dropped worldwide! So oil workers moved on! Canada  diversified the economy and PMJT welcomed Amazon plus 3000 new jobs! Duh!!!
3674 2018-05-01 16:32:05 Sometimes too much saliva or oil makes it slippery

3678 2018-05-01 16:31:43 Chop them up together! Drizzle olive oil and balsamic (lemon juice can substitute but not for you). Non-essential add-ons include sea salt, cracked pepper, fresh basil, fresh mozzarella, spinach, arugula, anything else you particularly like.
3679 2018-05-01 16:31:41 2 yrs ago, the price of a barrel of oil was almost twice as much as what it is now, yet the price of gasoline was a little less than what it is now. How does that even make sense ? It's GREED, nothing else @JustinTrudeau

Folks will stick with trusted brands.

3691 2018-05-01 16:30:01 Artists in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, who know Yan Zi usually introduce her somewhat like this: O, she belongs to no circle of oil painters in the city ... she is unique, quiet.
3692 2018-05-01 16:29:58 The gas prices are outrageous if you consider the fact that Canada is a oil refining nation  & other countries that produce gasoline have subsidies which brings the price down to 20 cents a liter, basically cost. Why aren't we paying cost if we produce it ?
3693 2018-05-01 16:29:54 And uses a lot of oil. 
Shame we're too wee and too poor to take advantage of it.

3695 2018-05-01 16:29:41 Also the ethical problem of putting our soldiers in harm's way by having to protect our sources of oil. We spent two trillion dollars on a war in Iraq that made us less safe. We buy oil from countries that don't like us very much and funds terrorism.
3696 2018-05-01 16:29:39 The Seminal argument here, is that Oil is past.  We are at most decades from the costs shooting up to luxury pricing, due to rarity.  Whatever the price of alternatives, including hidden costs like warming, they are far less than what we have, and will continue to pay for oil.

3702 2018-05-01 16:28:37 Great example. I’m in favour of incentives for green tech, but they need to be cost competitive.

Entirely revenue neutral carbon tax is most politically appealing. Even the most staunch conservative/oil sands worker couldn’t disagree w/ emissions reductions, & lower income taxes

3715 2018-05-01 16:27:37 Someone pls come take my car to get the oil changed
3716 2018-05-01 16:27:31 What else do they know, only to deplete Oil revenue. They will be forced to come to terms with realities soon and will learn how to live within their means. Time for reality is here, we will never go back to Egypt. Never!!!
3717 2018-05-01 16:27:30 Let's look at the facts 
E1: R2 watches his friends die due to a Jedi/Droid problem
E2: R2 gathers info about a secret Jedi wedding, infiltrates/sabotages droid production
E3: R2 takes a few out himself. Gets a taste for oil. Sees the Jedi destroyed.
3718 2018-05-01 16:27:30 You talkin about that Jamaican Black castor oil right ?
3719 2018-05-01 16:27:29 What would you all say if the earth's oil supply replenishes itself and gas prices are fake

3723 2018-05-01 16:26:52 I have to add-the picture posted with this uninformed caption is a mess. Sugar laden, wrong salt, probably nitrate added improperly raise meat and the wrong carbohydrates. Also probably cooked in the wrong oil. Also where are the vegetable and {fruit depending on diet needs).

3725 2018-05-01 16:26:48 How can they freeze prices at the orders of Govt ?. Same Govt said they can't interfere the pricing earlier.This is double standard &opportunism .Oil Co's should have rejected this orders &they r with in rules.Sadly they don't have CMD's with backbone to do that.
3726 2018-05-01 16:26:47 Ronnie Reagan and his "star wars" lasers Sally - Trump knows Russia and oil states are running out of money so he'e offering an expensive arms race (like Reagan did) that finally resulted in USSR collapse and Gorbachev coming to the disarmament table - don't underestimate Trump
3727 2018-05-01 16:26:46 When oil was found, nations became rich, nations went to war to control black gold, non cooperative leaders were toppled for all for of disguise. People became billionaires by dipping hand in oil. Bunkers held the criminal side. Today
3728 2018-05-01 16:26:35 Often overlooked, is the ever growing cost of extracting ever more rare oil.  I remember when they found a 'reserve' off the coast of South America.  It approaches a 100 per barrel, but it's a 'gozillion' barrels.  Do the math, though, and it's about six months supply.

3733 2018-05-01 16:25:59 If I came to get an oil change, that’s all I’m leaving with. Only exception is if my car gone break down if I don’t get the recommended service. Other than that. Oil change and nun else 
3734 2018-05-01 16:25:55 Folks are leaving Pruitt's EPA faster than oil leaking from a pipeline. #BootPruitt
3735 2018-05-01 16:25:43 Yes, with the current mindset, we're stuck with oil for a long time.

We need to change the mindset and accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels.

Resistance by big oil and their useful idiots is definitely an obstacle

Building dilbit pipelines is insanity
3736 2018-05-01 16:25:36 Seeing a car advertised as having the oil topped up when the light comes on. Er, no. When that light comes on, it means there's no oil pressure and the engine is now dying.
3737 2018-05-01 16:25:29 “Supply manipulation” is again something you say when you’ve been wrong on oil. Most OPEC countries are pumping as hard as they can, and decline rates are causing issues. The only real material excess supply is from SA, and their excess supply isn’t nearly what people think it is

3745 2018-05-01 16:24:58 I grew up in a village surrounded by oil wells in rural England. I loved to watch the nodding donkeys but you  could barely see them over a decent hedge, unlike wind turbines There was no trace of them a couple of years after decommissioning.
3746 2018-05-01 16:24:58 Note to self: When your eyes are watering from the peppermint oil you've just put on your face, do not use your peppermint oil-covered hand to wipe the tears away. That is a bad idea.

3764 2018-05-01 16:22:49 UK oil and gas currently supports 300,000 professional jobs and shale gas has a potential for a further 65,000 jobs. The idea that professional oil and gas  engineers  will get jobs fitting solar panels on roofs is entirely ridiculous.
3765 2018-05-01 16:22:22 Can one of yall, not doing shit.... take my car to get an oil change?
3766 2018-05-01 16:22:16 I'm certain it's the fault of Big Auto, Big Oil and Big Rubber killing the utopian dreamscape of urban mass transit.
3767 2018-05-01 16:22:02 When we built our house my wife and I argued a lot about the price of the shower system I had chosen. 

2’x3’ rain shower, 8 jets front and back, foot scrubber/massage, 3 sides glass, speakers, lights and essential oil steam. 

She loves it now and I could live in that mofo.
3768 2018-05-01 16:21:58 No one is surprised that @realDonaldTrump uses alopecia treatment for hair growth. Trump causes a controversy when there doesn't need to be one. It doesn't sound like a "well oil machine in the WH" to me. Chaos and controversy. @MSNBC

The EIA also reports that the production of residual fuel oil in excess of 1.0% sulfur in 2017 was only 322kb/d. <2% of refinery production

3778 2018-05-01 16:20:45 you could use castor oil as a overnight/day treatment for pimples. it works for me, but you could try it out and see if it works for you
3779 2018-05-01 16:20:45 You’re just dumb. The only reason the United States is even interested in anything Nigeria is doing is due to the crude oil you produce. The United States is going to destroy any stability Nigeria has and take all of the resources...again. Smh When black people love colonialism
3780 2018-05-01 16:20:18 And with the limited & flawed policy framework of the SARB, higher inflation will mean a higher Repo rate, despite these facts:
1) the SARB repo does not influence oil prices.
2) inflation caused by higher oil prices is supply side, not demand driven so Repo is wrong instrument.

3787 2018-05-01 16:19:05 The high gas prices in North America are being blamed on the shut down of two refineries for maintenance (during a high demand season).  If we keep moving towards renewables, we might be less economically dependant upon the health of a handful of oil refineries.

3802 2018-05-01 16:17:10 @squalllive What this town/county needs is another oil spill to fulfill their wish list. Drill, baby, drill! But the taxpayer will never see a tax benefit from the BP funds, only the well entrenched.
3803 2018-05-01 16:17:06 S&P Global Ratings report came in with 95 corporate defaults in 2017, a three year low, with most concentrated in the energy sector due to residual stress from the crash in oil prices. #markets #finance
3804 2018-05-01 16:16:57 TIL: socks are greatly affected (negatively) by loads of grinding dust on hard wood floors. Three pairs had to be sent to immediate retirement today. Will have a new use as oil rugs in the workshop. End of message.

3809 2018-05-01 16:16:36 FYI: Crude Oil is just as common as "Friday the 13ths".

3833 2018-05-01 16:14:21 Probably because the Federation was stealing their dilithium crystals the same as USA & middle eastern oil.
3834 2018-05-01 16:13:56 So Pruitt didn't fly first class, rent a room through an oil lobbyist, "build a cone of silence" for $43,000, triple the salaries of his OK buddies (after the WH told then no). So who is the real liar here? He is wasting mine and your tax dollars. This isn't a partisan issue!!!

3837 2018-05-01 16:13:37 You would hate America too if it overthrew your democratic government that wanted to nationalize oil fields and then install a brutal dictator that no one liked
3838 2018-05-01 16:13:29 if youput it that way...then Al Bundy is a shoe salesman, and Trump Bundy is a snake oil salesman

just put oil in your shoes and you get both of them in a nutshell

3845 2018-05-01 16:12:31 Alberta has the best oil/bitumen in the World. The value per barrel far exceeds benchmark crude oils. Bitumen is very adaptable for refining-you can make whatever you want. That is why entities like Dogwood want to control bitumen exports.

3855 2018-05-01 16:11:27 Remember back in the old days when we didn't have social media to occupy us while we waited for an oil change?
3856 2018-05-01 16:11:21 Greenpeace say Yemen-based Hayel Saeed Anam Group, which sells palm oil to Mars, Nestlé, PepsiCo, & Unilever through subsidiaries, is responsible for clearing 40 squ km of rainforest & peatland in Indonesia’s Papua province 2015-2017. There is film of the destruction.
3857 2018-05-01 16:11:19 No worries, it's just Pruitt's weekly payoff package from the oil industry.
3858 2018-05-01 16:11:17 No way we should be building pipelines to ship raw oil out of the country. It would be best to leave it in the ground, but if it’s going to be mined, it should at least be refined in Canada

3888 2018-05-01 16:07:37 Shea butter or castor oil. It helps clump it and gives a better curl at the end. Maybe that’s the trick.
3889 2018-05-01 16:07:37 What's funny is I haven't seen many open carry until lately. Getting my oil changed this past weekend and 2 black men, not together, were carrying. So 3 of us in 1 office.

3910 2018-05-01 16:05:17 Define "future of oil." Oil will be with us for the rest of this century. Demand probably won't peak until 2060 or 2070, then a slow decline. And don't forget the 25% of supply consumed for non-combustion uses (e.g. plastics).
3911 2018-05-01 16:05:10 Agree, inflation impulse nothing more as the previous 2 - base effect of oil

3928 2018-05-01 16:02:39 Just don’t let an oil company bid on leasing grazing rights on federal lands. Which would make the federal gov’t more money. Return grazing lands to wild life.

4005 2018-05-01 15:56:25 It is sp obviously price gouging. Look at cost per liter compared to cost of oil per barrell from 2010 to now. 
2010 - 1.12 per liter/ 135$per barrell
2018 - 1.61 per liter/ 68$per barrell.

4022 2018-05-01 15:54:18 The jobs they're talking about aren't for constructing the pipeline.  It's jobs in the oil patch from the increased investment because of all the extra oil that's being exported.
4023 2018-05-01 15:54:13 @SecretaryZinke our national parks like Bears Ears are priceless national treasures. Do the right things and say no to their exploitation. No amount of money from oil is worth their destruction.
4024 2018-05-01 15:54:04 Yes. Omega 9 is oleic, found in olive oil, butter, etc.

I wouldn't focus on eating omega-9 fats, as the body makes them quite readily.

4077 2018-05-01 15:47:34 Democracy could only last as long as the  Nazis and their peak oil net energy lasted. Net energy failure , the moment in time when the oil you get out cost more to extract than you can profit from.
4078 2018-05-01 15:47:28 Super grateful to God for everyone who has purchased my facial oil. Super grateful for everyone who has told and showed me how well it's working for them!
4079 2018-05-01 15:47:20 Did you know that you can reuse our small essential oil bottles? I love to use them as cane toppers in the garden!
4080 2018-05-01 15:47:19 @VelshiRuhle the plan total world control by the ruling class; maintain military presence in the Mid East - maintain/gain control over oil - blame iran for fictitious violations to restrict oil exports - assist russian oligarchs/putin - remove further trade restrictions - PNAC
4081 2018-05-01 15:47:19 I was also told to try that years ago. Ive been on many "diets" and none have given me the same results as i have now. Im down 10kgs in 5 weeks. Its hard. Very few food you can eat. No butter or oil etc when cooking.

4088 2018-05-01 15:46:12 Albertan's believe that the province is too dependent on oil as an economic driver.  What's that got to do with taxes? Taxes are not going to replace economic drivers? We cant move Alberta's labour force from oil to the sales tax sector.

4094 2018-05-01 15:45:28 I hear that if you spritz a little lavender oil spiders won't come around. Dilute it with a little witch hazel. I tried it last year in my garage. Haven't seen a spider since. I reapply every 3 to 6 months. Good luck!

4103 2018-05-01 15:44:24 Hmm. Wondering why of all  the shit hole countries u chose Nigeria as the only 1 worthy of a WH invite? Oh wait. Maybe it’s because they’re the only 1 that also happens to be a huge oil producer? So noble of you.
4104 2018-05-01 15:44:21 Hello @jamieoliver Do @JamiesItalianUK cook everything healthy? No salt, no butter, no oil? #Mcknobhead
4105 2018-05-01 15:44:20 Current account should adjust more quickly than in the past because oil and fuel commodities are low margin and can be refined elsewhere to avoid the us currency.  Tbonds are voluptuous, irresistible at 3-4% driving capital tho
4106 2018-05-01 15:44:15 Nigeria got oil.

4110 2018-05-01 15:43:53 The oil sands have been the target of US special interest groups for years & the oil industry made the mistake of staying quiet & not fighting back. Oil has been oozing out of that formation for millennia, it's a natural oil spill basically & industry is cleaning it up.

4117 2018-05-01 15:43:18 2/3 Fracking? Did I miss the class where you intended to teach me how fracking techniques to extract oil/gas have been used in #Canada for the last 35 yrs & how fracking is expected to make oil production in the #USA grow at a rate unparalleled by any country in history by 2025?

4121 2018-05-01 15:43:01 There are 15 Million hectares of palm oil worldwide. Palm oil production is 60 Million tonnes.
You'd need more than 100 million hectares of soy to produce 60 million tonnes of oil.
Deforestation caused by palm oil production is less than 3% of global deforestation since 1990.

4128 2018-05-01 15:42:22 Beto all I can think of is your poor car. I bet it's an electric vehicle. New tires every 60,000 miles. An oil change every 10,000 miles. That means you will go through about five sets of tires and need at least 30 oil changes before we vote for you.

4129 2018-05-01 15:42:21 Oh the fishing stories one hears when waiting for oil change/tire rotation when you live near a lake.

4154 2018-05-01 15:40:25 For once, use your brains. Make sure the information transmits straight to your neurons. Then the neurons will connect to your cerebrum which is the largest part of your brains.

4161 2018-05-01 15:39:10 PDG Ould Kaddour wants @sonatrach_dz amongst the top five national oil companies. Depending how you measure, he has CNPC, Iran NOC or @AdnocGroup to beat. See our analysis in @AfricanEnergy
4162 2018-05-01 15:39:07 Ok sometimes my proxy is dumb as hell like they let me put the Kurama oil diffusers in my cart but I deleted them because I didn’t know if I put the right scents and now they’re like omg no you can’t buy them they’re perfumes.
4163 2018-05-01 15:38:57 It is clear our nation is reliant upon big foreign oil. More and more of our imports are coming from overseas.

4189 2018-05-01 15:36:30 Why $3.10 a gallon when barrel is $67??? The last time it was $3 a gal was when oil was $100 barrel? Instead of raising taxes why dont you do something for the people? Casino in OIl City area? Benefits little people with Jobs??

4201 2018-05-01 15:34:30 Would the sanctions mean oil supply from Iran cut down? Supply numbers coming down? Would OPEC increase the supply to meet the demand or let the demand rise further?

4208 2018-05-01 15:33:32 2/4. I agree that if oil and gas goes ahead these areas cannot count against Aichi, but targets are a mean towards effective marine conservation. These areas contain sensitive habitats that cannot be found elsewhere; ecological risks are higher and so should be the bar.

He didn't close GITMO, expanded authority of AUMF for more military conflicts, catered to the big banks and Wall St, caved under oil/gas lobby, didn't regulate big pharma companies...
4217 2018-05-01 15:32:12 Am sure you Mr President dose not support genocide? Because that man you ate referring to is a murder. He killed Biafrans every single day. He killed biafrans celebrating you presidential victory on 20/01/2017.we want nothing but freedom .you can have the oil but give us freedom

4222 2018-05-01 15:31:11 I use African black soap, but it has to be the REAL kind that you break off in chunks, not a bar or it will dry your skin! Vitamin e oil helps even skin tone, puffy or dark eyes, long lashes and even helped my dryness! I can send you some DIY natural masks that really help (:

4226 2018-05-01 15:30:50 Πάμε παλι, το baby oil έχει ενυδατική χρήση, επίσης χρησιμοποιείται μετά την αποτρίχωση ή το ξύρισμα ή στο ντεμακιγιάζ. Αν σε ευχαριστεί να το βάζεις στον κωλο σου, ποια ειμαι να σε κρίνω

4239 2018-05-01 15:29:33 Just like what's happening in Syria with the fake chemical weapons and the sudden focus on Iran, is it because they've started trading oil in euros rather than the petrol dollar 
4240 2018-05-01 15:29:32 Whats you're point unless your saying salmond was some kind of mystic Meg and could see 4 years into the future, add to the fact that oil won't make any money for at least another 2-3 years, still waiting on the three principles of the SNP, making it easier for you now.

4244 2018-05-01 15:29:09 @LeBatardShow those 2013 figures are terribly incorrect. The oil boom dropped in 2014. good people lost an income that supported whole families. When someone is gone working in the oil field the other person generally has to stay home and managed the children's lives. Shits hard

4260 2018-05-01 15:27:31 Take gas and oil out and you may have a negative reading.
4261 2018-05-01 15:27:18 @LeBatardShow also, oil field wages were cut way down after the price of oil collapsed in 2015. Still pretty damn high. Guys who work on the rig make about $50k, but the management/engineers skew the average way up.
4262 2018-05-01 15:27:17 @LeBatardShow I risk paper cuts everyday damn the oil rig workers

4291 2018-05-01 15:25:10 @LeBatardShow I work in the oil fields (Oklahoma). The reason we don't get paid like NFL players is because we're replaceable and a lot of these dudes are ex cons. Even so, we get paid way more for our skill level due to the inherent risk.

4297 2018-05-01 15:24:50 I don't speak Greek, hurt would I be right to conclude that a lifetime of margarine and vegetable oil in an effort to be healthy can result in osteoarthritis? Might that be reversible by correcting the dietary fat content (rather than calcium pills)?

4334 2018-05-01 15:20:55 Following this would sustain a state of ketosis. Fat macros are the goal, protein is a limit and carbs are a hard limit. Also focusing on good fats is obviously ideal (olive oil, avocado/oil, fish oils, ghee, coconut oil, etc.)
4335 2018-05-01 15:20:47 Check your breather tube first. Also the breather itself. About the only way oil can get in the carb is through the breather. Otherwise air is moving through toward the piston. If a ring was blown I'd think you would have oil coming out the exhaust.
4336 2018-05-01 15:20:38 Putin would love for us to pull out of the Iran deal. Sanctions against Iran will drive up the price of oil and Putin desperately needs the price of oil to increase. Who is a bigger threat Iran or Putin???

4355 2018-05-01 15:18:33 Trump knows what our president likes to hear most. He wants to sell farm produce to us our president should have table our crude oil too.
4356 2018-05-01 15:18:29 All power plants are estabished recently byModijis rule.
Before. Modiji came to power, there was no power in India. PEOPLE used oil lamps,and noindustries factories

4357 2018-05-01 15:18:22 Your eyebrows look like you filled them in with oil pastel whattt
4358 2018-05-01 15:18:18 It would go away in about 3 to 4 days for me. It’s sucked sooo bad having it though. I would rinse it out with sea salt and then put tea tree oil over night.
4359 2018-05-01 15:17:58 Trump leaked itIn his Mind...To contaminate the Questions Might Delay His Having to Answer Them
Trump knows He's Busted and Now Is Just Stalling for More Time as POTUS to Fullfill His Agenda
Which is Putin and Middle Easts Oil Agenda 
More Money-Power for Trump
4360 2018-05-01 15:17:41 I need Starbucks Corporation they are much smarter than Murphy Oil Corporation even before the war began with Bernie.
4361 2018-05-01 15:17:38 Aur thoda oil daal, Jal nhi raha theek se 
4362 2018-05-01 15:17:13 Did a twist out using @sheamoisture’s staple curl enhancing smoothie and I forgot just how much of a gem this product is. My hair is so fluffy and moisturized! I started off with the curl milk as my leave-in, smoothie as my styler, and grapeseed oil as my sealant 
4363 2018-05-01 15:17:12 Damn I need another oil for my pen. 
4364 2018-05-01 15:17:07 Oil of oregano.
4365 2018-05-01 15:17:01 GS knows little about oil except how to use it to suck your retirement savings from you --

4368 2018-05-01 15:16:34 Oil cleanser bagus ke untuk oily skin?
4369 2018-05-01 15:16:31 On this occasion, houses, streets and especially mosques were decorated with colorful pennants and bunting whereas at night these were well illuminated by means of electric lights, candles or even oil lamps.

4370 2018-05-01 15:16:30 If your boyfriend always keep his house in order and clean bcos you are coming over just know you are just one of his mechanic for changing oil and repairs.
4371 2018-05-01 15:16:26 Haha... Trump declined in buying Nigeria's crude oil, but he said that their great agricultural products should and will be sold more in Nigeria... Buhari was there laughing like a moron... #POS
4372 2018-05-01 15:16:12 They hate peppermint essential oil leave some on a cotton pad in the secret mouse corners and it (they) should vacate your room at least  
4373 2018-05-01 15:16:08 And she uses good olive oil
4374 2018-05-01 15:16:07 I work in an oil trading office. The fact twits like you chirp on social media like you understand the market and the economy is pathetic. Try to get some info beyond the Huffington Post.
4375 2018-05-01 15:16:00 Exactly. Thank you. If you tweet about Russia, Iran and oil you will be harassed by Russian trolls. Especially if you mention how Putin desperately needs the price of oil to increase. Any war uses oil and gas and increases the price.
4376 2018-05-01 15:15:57 He’s fond of using tea 3 oil whatever that is.
4377 2018-05-01 15:15:49 Mineral oil when that happens, she prob gets like constipated lol
4378 2018-05-01 15:15:46 Rey get a oil change & head to work.
4379 2018-05-01 15:15:46 Easier than getting an oil change, eh?
4380 2018-05-01 15:15:43 I started using Oil Obsessed cleansing oil 6 weeks ago. Since then so many people have commented on how great my skin looks. Love it! @bareMineralsUK
4381 2018-05-01 15:15:29 Lo dici tu. Il solare non è in crisi in nessun modo. Ha superato da solo nel 2018, globalmente, gli investimenti in oil&Gas e carbone combinati. In Italia, di 400MW installati 78MW sono impianti a terra. Praticamente tutta la nuova capacità installata in Italia è Solare ed eolico

4386 2018-05-01 15:15:14 And that savings can be invested into gen IV nuclear power to energize households switching from natural gas/oil heating to clean grid energy and switching from ICE vehicles to EVs. Cleaning up the grid is the key. Once that is done it can be leveraged in many ways to kill CO2.
4387 2018-05-01 15:15:13 #Trump is going to be a dirty word in alot of industries and with alot of investors . still copper now oil & gas & semis ect ect ect all #TANKING cause of TRUMP tanks for nothing @BernieSanders would do better
4388 2018-05-01 15:15:11 How dense is that fucking oil slick on your head that you can't understand what an opinion piece is?
4389 2018-05-01 15:14:51 Do you know how they stop a fire in an oil rig?  Dynamite!
4390 2018-05-01 15:14:40 When the money oil came through!!!
4391 2018-05-01 15:14:27 This type of propaganda makes me so mad, carbon tax takes money out of the middle@class and gives it to big buisness and wasteful government. We need more pipelines to get oil to new customers and grow the Canadian economy
4392 2018-05-01 15:14:24 @WhiteHouse @EUCouncil Uncertainty ? Barrel of Oil goes up $ 1Dollar daily , this is pure speculators,shorters, Hedge Funds, Oil lobby Paradise. War Contractors waiting for 2nd part of scam to start : Juicy never ending War contracts, dumb gentiles ,aren't they great ?
4393 2018-05-01 15:14:24 No, she meant rub coconut oil onto tilapia faces then set them free again...

4395 2018-05-01 15:14:15 Getting my oil changed and everybody sitting here is watching my belly ferociously move around. We got lots of movements this morning
4396 2018-05-01 15:14:14 While we’re celebrating a day off, we’ll return tomorrow with platinum under $900 & the rand at 12.64 vs $. The £ and € also under pressure, both below important psychological levels. The recent weakness in rand with higher oil price will change our inflation outlook negatively.
4397 2018-05-01 15:14:13 Vice President @ProfOsinbajo talks about how last administration with Oil at $100 pb and what they spent on Agriculture & Transport.. & that this admin is spending more with far less ... #ThePlatformNG #VPOAtPlatform

4400 2018-05-01 15:13:17 And #oil bounces. Damn today’s easy. #oott
4401 2018-05-01 15:13:14 Hi @AmandaGuerraTX I am curious, because there isn't much information online (or I am not looking for the right things). How much of American Oil is owned by non US companies? Makes me wonder why Americans argue semantics over things when something this big isn't discussed/fixed
4402 2018-05-01 15:13:14 i used avocado, coconut oil, honey, and egg. hope it helps
4403 2018-05-01 15:13:10 You do know we no longer live in a capitalistic society? And it hasn't been one for over 3 decades? This is an Oligarchy, you twit. You people always seem to ignore this fact. And Venezuela was wealthy and prospering until the collapse oil has taken. You are truly blind.
4404 2018-05-01 15:13:02 took the lost on $EKG .....but slapped $STMP right on the ask at 0.205$ ! Ready for the bounce back in the next few days ! Only 30M O/S 

The selloff is due mainly by Lutfur Rahman Khan that has resigned as a director and chairman of the board of Stamper Oil & Gas Corp.
4405 2018-05-01 15:12:59 Interesting how when a Rep is in the White House oil and gas prices rise, contrary to their campaign promises. And the rich and corps get richer, contrary to their claim to help the working class
4406 2018-05-01 15:12:46 The proposed pipelines are racing to see if Iran or SA will control it.  It has always been the pipelines & oil.  President Trump was right US should have taken the oil.  7Trillion dollars in ME.  For what? Where did all that money go? Most during Obama years.
4407 2018-05-01 15:12:43 Decided to just try a Bulletproof coffee to see what it’s like. I just don’t think I like ghee, guys. It’s like butter gone bad. (It’s fine when used as a cooking oil.)
4408 2018-05-01 15:12:33 You’re a total disappointment in the sack, aren’t you? 
Repressed misogynists always are.

Making movies is a business. Just like that oil change place you work at. Nobodies talking about art but you.
4409 2018-05-01 15:12:29 Thank you. Lovely people who happen to have oil.......just like Scotland,Syria, Yemen ( pipeline access) Venezuela etc etc.....
4410 2018-05-01 15:12:24 nope! Poser Paste is oil based and since oil and water don't mix, you're good. just remove with shampoo!
4411 2018-05-01 15:12:23 salman  sir, I am your big fn  of your's. But I am thing about your  marry .  I am a small person but I want 2 give u 1 solsustion , buy a 1 lock (tala) and dip in a soyabin oil, and lock it , then through it on the road ,on thursday . But plse sir dnt unlock the lock again

4415 2018-05-01 15:12:10 Does oil spilled on the surface reach a deep aquifer?
4416 2018-05-01 15:12:05 Do u think my professor would dock points if I put in a meme about oil in my final paper
4417 2018-05-01 15:12:04 If I see palm oil listed in ingredients I replace it back on the shelf.
4418 2018-05-01 15:12:02 Samurai Bloody Oil.
4419 2018-05-01 15:11:53 Don't forget "his corruption".  While that is covered by "disdain for law", it warrants its own mention.  See the story about "financial hardship" for his buddy's oil company.
4420 2018-05-01 15:11:53 Really? Trump, Ryan, Mitch, corporations,  Russians, Tea Party, NRA, HMO's, pharmaceuticals, coal, oil industries, insurance.
Really I can go on but if a person has to ask, they didn't understand the question.

4422 2018-05-01 15:11:43 Looks like a 3100/3400 oil pan. Not surprised. They seem to all be expiring the same way now.
4423 2018-05-01 15:11:39 getting oil changes on my car are just as bad as waiting at the doctors office. urgh.
4424 2018-05-01 15:11:39 The Minister of Energy for Ghana, Hon. Boakye Agyarko is currently speaking at a panel discussion on "New Oil and Gas Horizons and Procurement Projects"
4425 2018-05-01 15:11:25 Our country has been pumping out propaganda since the Vietnam War.  Wars based upon lies just to make banking, oil and military-industrial profit.... one after another
4426 2018-05-01 15:11:19 Of course when I bring my car to get my oil changed they find other stuff wrong too 
4427 2018-05-01 15:11:14 Raises a bigger question: who else has Michelle Rempel accepted bribes from? When Michelle Rempel was Minister for Western Economic Diversification did she accept gifts from #oil + #gas lobby? Is that why #Alberta's economy never divested from #fossilfuels? #ResignRempel #cdnpoli

4430 2018-05-01 15:10:23 Treasury yields rise while dollar strength weighs on oil...
4431 2018-05-01 15:10:21 Oh cool! Cuz I really wanna befriend my local murder  I tried scattering some scrambled eggs yesterday (no oil or butter or anything) but I’m not sure if they noticed
4432 2018-05-01 15:10:15 Lopez tb es dueño de OIL que no tiene línea editorial...
4433 2018-05-01 15:10:11 But everyone is still using oil so the point is moot

4441 2018-05-01 15:09:11 oil prices increased due to USA not Notley or #Trudeau
4442 2018-05-01 15:09:07 Yep (reservations around cutting out palm oil rather than supporting ethical palm are similar: it's often replaced by soya which can take more land). Everything we do from within an unethical system is damage control, but as long as folk like you keep trying, we move forward.
4443 2018-05-01 15:09:07 I got myself(ke rata dilo & e nkga monate) & my boo(his skin is problematic) the Marula Skin Oil. It has helped him so much. 
Thank you. 
4444 2018-05-01 15:08:59 It's disgraceful the oil CEO's are going to raise prices at the pump based on Americans are making more money!!! Not seniors! Their SS raises go to Medicare. STOP their tax breaks that cause everyone to pay twice.
4445 2018-05-01 15:08:56 also if you can stand the feel of oils, try the rosehip seed oil, its really good! And the hylauranic serum for under moisturiser in the day!
4446 2018-05-01 15:08:40 Trump/GOP has election worries if oil price surge hurts the economy hard. But still, possible to see higher oil price may benefit *all - KSA, UAE, Russia, USA. Either by a war or tension/possibility of war.
4447 2018-05-01 15:08:26 Looks like they blocked your followers 
4448 2018-05-01 15:08:23 Lastly, the news story itself explains that Canadians buy all our gas from the US, and everything I can find about the pipeline , both the existing and planned, is that they carry oil, no gas or diesel. Pretty sure you pulled that out of your ass.
4449 2018-05-01 15:08:05 Heat protection spray before ironing. I use the one from Tresemme. Oil after. I read somewhere that using an oil based product before straightening is equivalent to “frying” hair, which might damage it.

4452 2018-05-01 15:07:49 Communists supporting North Vietnam and US supporting South Vietnam. The golf war was about removing a dictator/oil/another US Russia proxy war.  The North South Korean war was about independence. The Falkland war was about recapturing UK land. The second golf war was same as 1st
4453 2018-05-01 15:07:43 Socialism and a social democracy are two different things. Look it up. And anyone who bases their entire economy on oil, which in this day and age people are moving away from, it will fail. That's just bad investment.
4454 2018-05-01 15:07:42 The truth may be stretched thin, but it never breaks, and it always surfaces above lies, as oil floats on water. -Miguel de Cervantes.
4455 2018-05-01 15:07:17 I can't wait to hear trump tweet about having a "too strong" dollar.  Impressive drop in gold, oil, stocks,  bitcoin, and bonds, all in the same day! #stagflation
4456 2018-05-01 15:07:13 listen. its bad, its almost chocolate and oil only
4457 2018-05-01 15:07:11 No don’t use the spray that’s works more for other kinds of piercings like your belly. I’ve never used tea tree oil for it so I’m not sure. But the guy who pierced my nose told me to never use anything other than antibacterial soap.
4458 2018-05-01 15:06:59 Oil must be dropping.

4488 2018-05-01 15:04:23 Okay, you guys. This week, I’m dumping my blue cheese salad dressing in favor of oil and vinegar. I’m going to let it be a once a week treat, but this is the one processed food I’ve kept eating. 
4489 2018-05-01 15:04:17 Ultimately the economy is headed for extinction like the species so this fuss over the renewables versus oil won't matter in my opinion. Right now it's all about the money and getting/staying in power. Ultimately extinction will solve this sort of economic/political bullshitting.
4490 2018-05-01 15:04:16 Have you tried Planeta Olive oil ?
4491 2018-05-01 15:04:12 It’s gonna be a long long day. I don’t get out of work till 645pm or a bit later but I need to be there right after the oil service change
4492 2018-05-01 15:04:12 Pray for the greed fostered by the resources of oil in the land to be overcome by a spirit of generosity. Pray for profits to be used to improve the living conditions and education of the poor. Pray for key leaders in the royal family, government, and petroleum industry.
4493 2018-05-01 15:04:02 Headlines should read: Young lady rocks Chinese dress at prom, dangerously jealous mob of sweatpants wearing race hustlers and sad people form hate mob. Lovely dress wearer remains unfazed and steadfast in her right to wear whatever the f*ck she wants.
4494 2018-05-01 15:03:45 Wow, now txdot takes the used oil and filter place out..... #goingbackwardsintime  living here is cool, but some shit is just stone age over here in #fortdavis

4497 2018-05-01 15:03:17 At best this pipeline could help to reduce the increase. Regardless, none of the oil in that pipeline is destined to be Canadian gasoline. It is a pipeline being built to take oil to Asia, not to American refineries. As I said, propaganda at its finest.
4498 2018-05-01 15:03:06 I just apply body lotion/butter/oil after shower and scrub twice a week. Nothing special tbh

4500 2018-05-01 15:02:54 and if you aren't a fan of sweet things, try guzzling olive oil...
4501 2018-05-01 15:02:43 What right has America got to intimidate anyone, give us your oil or we’ll bomb you back to the Stone Age. Having a go at Iran, if America hadn’t given Israel nuclear weapons Iran wouldn’t feel it needs them.
4502 2018-05-01 15:02:35 Beer oil sounds nice, tell me more
4503 2018-05-01 15:02:35 The #Zambia and #Angola exchange must be accorded the highest attention by Presdent @EdgarCLungu because of the  huge potential for unlocking economic opportunities, getting our oil next door, we are behind schedule!

4522 2018-05-01 15:01:26 Subsidizing fossils fuel companies, pushing for expansion of the oil sands (Canada's largest GHG source) & a carbon pricing plan that allows provinces to design plans where they take money from citizens and use that to subsidize the fossil fuel industry = fail. Design a real plan
4523 2018-05-01 15:01:18 Be careful about spitting the “coco” down the sink.... when I did the Coconut oil Swish for my teeth,  I had to spit it outside.  The coconut congeals & blocks the pipes.  Gross but spit it outside.
4524 2018-05-01 15:01:17 The whole time George W Bush was president and launching the destruction of our country with a pointless war in support of oil interests, I never once wished Canada would come in and bomb us to get rid of him.

4526 2018-05-01 15:01:15 Try castor oil
4527 2018-05-01 15:01:13 Will you also bring down the oil prices for cheaper gas?

4530 2018-05-01 15:01:09 Oil of oregano. 5-6 drops in water or juice , or straight (burns like hell for a minute then relieves sore throat)  Antibacterial properties. Often short circuits a cold. Never travel without it.
4531 2018-05-01 15:01:08 Hi John, if it is burning at the bottom then it cuts out as a safety feature.. we would advise to clean the burnt bits off and anything starchy or that have a high natural sugar content (such as tomatoes) put some oil on the base to prevent ingredients from sticking.

4533 2018-05-01 15:01:01 A lot of Biodiesel is made from corn oil produced at ethanol plants.
4534 2018-05-01 15:00:52 An overlooked angle to the profusion and promotion of high-carb, sugar-laden, and/or seed oil soaked junk food is that all of the ingredients are really cheap, so the food has a high profit margin.
4535 2018-05-01 15:00:51 What is stopping us from taking the oil revenue and building outwards?
4536 2018-05-01 15:00:46 I need some coconut oil in my life

4539 2018-05-01 15:00:40 I've watched so much @nailogical recently that I dreamed about making nail oil last night after a nail tech was going to charge me £40000
4540 2018-05-01 15:00:36 @CNBCFastMoney Icahn oil refinery’s gets financial hardship waiver from EPA, any more faster money  than this?
4541 2018-05-01 15:00:33 So of course there is a communication/link between Opec and Russia - (KSA, UAE) - and all this timing. Finally glut maybe over. Then - war? (but aftermath can be really hard to manage ... ?) 

Gulf monarchies, Russia, USA - can sure gain from higher/highest oil price but ...?
4542 2018-05-01 15:00:31 How do you decide what smart money's position is? Doing my research, it looks like oil ETFs are still large holdings in many institutions' funds by %. Now... they might have puts to protect that (I do too), but that trade is bullish, not bearish.
4543 2018-05-01 15:00:28 0時です。今日も一日、オイルと共に頑張りましょう。
4544 2018-05-01 15:00:23 お、よい子はハンターさんに任せて寝る時間だぞ！
4545 2018-05-01 14:59:53 Shave with baby oil , watch your skin glow 
4546 2018-05-01 14:59:44 Also, the same factors inhibiting our utilisation of oil for development will never let us be a tax-dependent economy.
4547 2018-05-01 14:59:39 Why's palm oil omnipresent these days? What did we use before, or, why is this destruction happening now, from that point of view? Is it because food companies are so big, or population growth? Keep buying Brazil nuts, cos they'll only grow in rainforest 
4548 2018-05-01 14:59:37 Thanks. I'm not saying it has to happen right away - I believe in respecting the trend and the trend is still up for now. But, when it turns, it could get really ugly. Also, in the case of the 2014 oil bust, the oil glut didn't truly develop until after the $-surge induced crash.
4549 2018-05-01 14:59:36 Because they weren't overly dependent on only oil. Allowed them invest in other areas and grow.
4550 2018-05-01 14:59:33 World oil production is 80+ million barrels, a pipeline carrying an extra 80000 barrels,  0.1%, is not going to make a significant change in world oil pricing. Also, could the pipeline even be complete by this summer? Also a pipeline not yet complete can't raise prices.
4551 2018-05-01 14:59:31 2 hour wait for an oil change ?? Why me 
4552 2018-05-01 14:59:19 Yep I think commodities usually move with oil prices!!!
4553 2018-05-01 14:59:02 Most important lesson learned so far this finals week: tea tree oil comes in clutch to wake up your skin and bring you back to focus
4554 2018-05-01 14:58:52 Are you going to sear it in coconut oil first, is the obvious question here.
4555 2018-05-01 14:58:50 เรื่องของกูก็คือเรื่องของกู อย่ามาวุ่นวาย รำคาญ
4556 2018-05-01 14:58:46 I hate going to do shit like getting my oil changed  a nigga supposed to do that
4557 2018-05-01 14:58:44 Sab farzi data hai. Kitna wapas karna hai wo to bata do. Sharam karo humse chote desh sasta oil bech rhe hain aur hamare neta lut rhe hain.
4558 2018-05-01 14:58:44 But oil is productive, and has been put to excellent use by many countries, as the original tweet described.
4559 2018-05-01 14:58:43 I like your analysis, but quite frankly it means zero in a speculative sector such as cannabis at the moment. Entire market has been manipulated from day one and these support/resistance levels though relevant in a sector such as oil, metals, etc is bang on. Here it means nothing
4560 2018-05-01 14:58:42 I would not. I found @NickWhalenMP shared some fair points from the other side of what is a complex story. I do think oil and gas should not be allowed in this area, but this does not mean there are no arguments both ways.

4563 2018-05-01 14:58:08 I'm usually on Fb send me a request (Charity Francis) if you are interested in the best CBD oil. Get added to my group ( your health matters) for give aways
4564 2018-05-01 14:57:58 Foreign influence to land lock Canadians Oil. This needs to stop. We need to legislate against these organizations.
4565 2018-05-01 14:57:46 Open the dump valves on super-tankers and uncap offshore oil wells. I wanted to kill all the fish I couldn't afford nor eat, and smother
4566 2018-05-01 14:57:44 I'm swimming in oil, ugliness, stress, depression, anxiety, cancer, all the crappy stuff
4567 2018-05-01 14:57:42 Problem is that this April reportedly the oil glut (long persisted) finally *gone. That can risk super-hike in oil price - if something terribly goes wrong. 

Though, true, US has now domestic potential supply (shales/fracking) which easier to develop when price is higher.
4568 2018-05-01 14:57:41 if #OIL can't bounce here it is gonna get phucked badly.

4569 2018-05-01 14:57:33 Asheville was amazing! The folks get what we are doing. I'm taking that energy back to the shop to apply what we've learned from y'all. How about a hemp oil finish?
4570 2018-05-01 14:57:31 The door to exit O&G companies will be very tight, once the demand numbers turns negative. #Norway  will be a very interesting country to monitor when it comes to oil consumption. By end of 2018 10% of all cars will be #EV, by 2020 up to 30% of all cars will be #EV .

4583 2018-05-01 14:56:24 I’m not sure, but I assume so! Also for butter replacement, you can use coconut oil (which is amazing honestly) and for milk, I don’t know of anything besides the standard almond or soy alternatives..
4584 2018-05-01 14:56:15 In process of attracting shirts in da hole it's Jewish related  and high holiday related. Dollar reverse or pAuse. Helps oil get higher and apple does ok given Steve M DOD
4585 2018-05-01 14:56:13 If there is a spill in an environment that is considered to be unique then there are significant ramifications. You know that very well. It just happens to be that some people value the protection of an ecosystem against a remote possibility above oil revenue.
4586 2018-05-01 14:56:11 I hope they know CBD oil is a food supplement 
4587 2018-05-01 14:56:00 Do these fish oil supplements still work if I just look at the bottle on my counter every morning on my way out the door?

4589 2018-05-01 14:55:57 The military and economic power of the USA channeled the vast majority of the profits from Nigerian oil fields out of Nigeria, leaving the people poor. The American Empire is the biggest bully on the block.

4595 2018-05-01 14:55:08 Why are we building oil pipelines to feed the world with cheap gas, yet our gasoline prices or higher than almost every country in the world. $8. a gallon REALLY
4596 2018-05-01 14:55:03 saudi is so fucking disgusting and sharia law isn't helping at all- they should be kicked out of the un but people love oil huh

4598 2018-05-01 14:54:46 Were not even currently alright. The oil isn't even providing enough to give Nigerians the bare essentials and frankly, the situation would be same if you replaced oil with any alternatives.

4601 2018-05-01 14:54:38 #LOGIIC workshop is a great example of some of the innovation taking place in cybersecurity for the oil and gas industry. Glad to be speaking here today on the threats, the asset owner/operators though deserve all the credit for the strides they’re making.
4602 2018-05-01 14:54:38 Stopped out on oil (in profit, but Israel/Iran sniped me), equities super largish, and rekt by this dollar move… bad couple of weeks for me in regular markets.

4605 2018-05-01 14:54:10 It depends on the time frame. But Exxon and partners alone plan a 350,000-500,000 bpd oil output in thr medium term in Guyana
4606 2018-05-01 14:54:06 It's oil that is cold pressed from cannabis leaves, without the  thc, which shows up in drug test. It has calming benefits and overall health benefits for blood pressure and stroke prevention and heart health in general. I put two drops in my Juice in morning.
4607 2018-05-01 14:53:53 OIL 67.22 = support coming into view on 1H, candle count lower is extended. WHALES did not step in today. The significantly higher USD today still raises "cost" and PPB.
NATGAS 15M is starting a small 5th wave push higher. Correction pending.
4608 2018-05-01 14:53:42 Tea  oil is excellent for warts. It has antiviral and antifungal properties and it absorbs well into the tissues.

4610 2018-05-01 14:53:34 We already have a huge market, we needed to start producing before we start selling.

Our oil is hot cake in the market and we have OPEC limit

What we lack is employment opportunity, that's what Buhari asked for. If investors comes in, there will be production and employment
4611 2018-05-01 14:53:32 i lke to use On Guard. its an essential oil blend. also called thieves oil.  we use it as a preventative. but also water! and good sleep!
4612 2018-05-01 14:53:18 It also included a provision to open the Arctic national wildlife refuge to oil and gas development.  Oh, and it included the addition of over a trillion in new debt.  #hypocrites who bought votes with give always that couldn’t pass on their own... inspiring stuff
4613 2018-05-01 14:52:53 We have long past the date when a Scotland or indeed an UK oil fund would be feasible.
4614 2018-05-01 14:52:51 Orrr because either ways, oil will provide dollars and we'll be alright.
4615 2018-05-01 14:52:38 @RebelTaxi Pan. Tony Sampson. I've been doing so much research on him after he retired from EE&E. All I know is that he manages an oil rig at Alberta, Canada. You have to know more on this matter. I need to know!

4617 2018-05-01 14:52:10 Data is not the new oil or electricity or water or whale blubber. 

We need to stop saying things like this before people completely tune out.
4618 2018-05-01 14:51:54 Let's get this straight. You're against doing your part to save the planet, against Trudeau's excellent international standing, against a 50% female cabinet, against innovating technology to replace oil one day, against gays & gay marriage, against women's rights. Anything else?

4620 2018-05-01 14:51:41 its looking bad! i know a hedge fund manager had predicted a huge spike in DXY causing a major commodity sell off in Oil, which leads to a slowing down in economy and markets in a deflationary environment - but really hard to predict how gold will react - it could follow the DXY

4623 2018-05-01 14:50:50 @breeder_steve everyone that has seen symptomatic improvement from CBD cares. The problem is that 80% of the CBD sold into Canada comes from snake oil salesmen selling hemp seed oil made in Canada rebottled in  then sold back at a price that implies CBD like benefits
4624 2018-05-01 14:50:49 hairs getting white..... :)

4626 2018-05-01 14:50:39 There are several factors that go into predictions for an oil price increase, but the biggest is not Iran, but rather China and India.
4627 2018-05-01 14:50:22 I liked a cover up so we can spread oil to more places and spread the business
4628 2018-05-01 14:50:20 What country are you referring to? The Untied States is the 12th richest country on the planet. Of course the top countries are oil countries.
4629 2018-05-01 14:50:17 still no one will remember you like other great players you play with.... you wonder why????

4632 2018-05-01 14:50:00 @mrsretail1 I'm gonna try to make that aloe oil for sensitive skin, from that video you posted last night.
4633 2018-05-01 14:50:00 Many have been watching this including myself from the high $50's. When will it matter if ever? Maybe when Aramco goes public? Until then I don't see significant downside risk in oil...

4637 2018-05-01 14:49:14 This is untrue. Oil overdependence is only one item in a long list of contributing factors to our resource (and by extension economic) mismanagement.
4638 2018-05-01 14:49:13 Like we should care what Araghchi says is "sustainable." 

Just shut off their oil sales (Russia will gladly fill the gap), terminate Euro supply of advanced technology, crush their stupid currency, and wait.
4639 2018-05-01 14:49:13 It's not about oil. Surround the enemy with military presence, propagate lies across international mainstream media against them, and pressure them into surrendering without even getting into a real big fight. The banksters don't want a war with Iran. They want the Central Bank.
4640 2018-05-01 14:49:08 Well keep in mind, they will keep selling us oil as long as we demand it. But even these companies have stopped arguing about man made climate change.
4641 2018-05-01 14:49:04 Dollar gonna reverse  too then oil make 69.99~
4642 2018-05-01 14:49:00 Bibi was long oil.

4644 2018-05-01 14:48:53 Seriously I think Trinidad trying to run competition with Jamaica in Tourism. Guess what don't waste your time. Just like how the can't compete with you regarding oil and manufacturing for now. 

Jamaica in a class can't compare by any of their sister countries.

4647 2018-05-01 14:48:25 Oil prices are the highest level in years and will go up up up! This means(for the benefit of Trump Base)gas prices will continue to rise with no end in sight. FYI we have a glut of crude by Wall St keeping tankers at bay. Still glad you voted Trump? Great winning huh? #nogop

4651 2018-05-01 14:48:03 I had an oil change scheduled for today and the guy calls me and tells me that he’s too busy to do my oil change 
4652 2018-05-01 14:47:59 World knows Russia relies heavily on petroleum for its economy. The fossil fuel burning by #NuclearTitania can be responsible for the global warming that's rapidly melting Arctic ice, which is opening up new shipping lanes from Russia & making further oil exploration possible.
4653 2018-05-01 14:47:57 I know they have a la speedy oil or Walmart should be no more than $30

4657 2018-05-01 14:47:36 Nah, I seriously doubt your numbers. We did just fine before. 

Oil production is at record highs and we are still going broke. We need tax and royalty changes not more pointless production at giveaway prices.

There is no "tidewater" price, either. The oil will go to the US

4673 2018-05-01 14:46:20 my brother called and said “didn’t you say you needed an oil change?, meet me at the shop”
4674 2018-05-01 14:46:03 Was able to buy a bottle of the cleaning oil I’m currently using plus a refill for less than 400. Wow.

4681 2018-05-01 14:45:05 @Shell_India Hi, I purchased Shell oil online, but it seems the Shell Petrol pump people will replace oil that has only been purchased from the pump store. Might be a good idea even to take charges and give Shell buyers some support

4696 2018-05-01 14:43:33 Since I know, since you may also know,  plastic is a by product of oil& gas,  I have to now look at every item I own and ask myself: What am I willing to do without in order to be a real activist against the very large consumption of oil & gas?
4697 2018-05-01 14:43:32 Also, have a look at oil demand being destroyed some by strong US dollar also.  Growing exports from US to emerging markets relied on cheap dollar, no longer have that luxery

4702 2018-05-01 14:43:06 The lack of trust in Trump is caused by his own actions: Lying.  People might find Trump entertaining or like his brash style but he's hurting our country. The regulations he's cutting were put in place to help protect people e.g., clean air, water,  oil & gas, coal and banking.

4706 2018-05-01 14:42:40 So... What you're saying is, oil regulation is stuck in the 1950s.
4707 2018-05-01 14:42:38 I hope the government receives and follows good recommendations for better MPAs because the current approach is a disappointment. MPA with oil and gas development is a contradiction in terms. Undermines the other good environmental policy steps your government is taking

4711 2018-05-01 14:42:03 Jake, the viscosity of this oil is thicker than most. Because of this, it can take longer to come out, and can even slightly solidify. It can be helpful to place the bottle of oil in some warm water to warm back up slightly.

• Cover your head with a towel and breathe in the steam coming from the boiling pot. Inhaling the steam will clear your nasal passages.
4725 2018-05-01 14:40:25 Good. Wind energy is part of the future and God knows Oklahoma doesn't believe in progress. It's the oil industry that's sucking the life out of this state, but let's continue to ignore that.

I can hardly contain myself. So much winning! Yea!  Corp. Stock buy-backs. Oil and gas rising. Wages stagnant. So sick of winning.

4766 2018-05-01 14:34:57 Sure as fuel prices are hitting the roof! Oil company subsidies are a sham and a disgrace as much as the presidency!

4771 2018-05-01 14:34:21 If you put twice the carbon tax on imported oil and gas as you place on Canadian oil and gas you would see a shift to being self sufficient and then you can actually have gas prices that are stable .
4772 2018-05-01 14:33:58 Finally! I have time to get my oil changed.
4773 2018-05-01 14:33:58 Besides oil and aluminum I’m considering other commodities looking into different commodities ETFs oil is most speculated and it seems overcrowded on the long side short term. Long term it could be worth having tho....
4774 2018-05-01 14:33:56 @BrianLehrer Woman who spoke of USA culpability in mess of murders in Honduras & dictatorship in Honduras is USA fault. Oil corps. assassinating Hondurans. USA interfered in Honduras. Coup was Obama & HillaryClinton.

4778 2018-05-01 14:33:38 The concentrated flavour of the bacon in the extract means we only need a certain amount of it to balance the overall flavour of the product. There is no flavour of the sunflower oil left, as it becomes a perfect carrier for the rich bacon flavour. 

-TK
4779 2018-05-01 14:33:37 Haha no! CBD oil doesn’t have that affect on your system. But that weed cookie sounds legit. LOL
4780 2018-05-01 14:33:31 Hi Chris, bacon Extract is made by cooking bacon in sunflower oil for a certain amount of time and temperature, which infuses the oil with cooked bacon flavour. The oil is then cooled down, sieved and used in seasoning blend.

Bloody hypocrites
4792 2018-05-01 14:32:26 In old times war was for trade routes and the spoils. These days it's for trade agreements and the spoils are oil and gas pipelines. But that misses out the vital banking element. Is it a "world bank" linked to federal reserve that Syria and Iran have been resisting?
4793 2018-05-01 14:32:22 @BrianLehrer CURRENT WOMAN SPEAKER TELLS TRUTH. USA destroyed Honduras. Eco-activists there assassinated by oil corps. Dictators there due to USA.
4794 2018-05-01 14:32:21 But to the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever. You rule with a scepter of justice. You love justice and hate evil. Therefore, O God, your God has anointed you, pouring out the oil of joy on you more than on anyone else.” Hebrews 1:8,9
4795 2018-05-01 14:32:21 Senator:  What you fail to say is that BP rightly paid for the damages caused by the oil spill not the taxpayers.  Can a Socialist ever be honest about anything.  Doubtful!  JM

With just Shea butter and Virgin tube cream including olive or coconut oil, water and hair brush..

Babe, u good to go.

No bother do all those plenty mix mix.
4800 2018-05-01 14:31:53 Start watching what you eat, increase water intake. Use natural products like raw shea butter or coconut oil to moisturize when dry, and use gold bond powder on areas that are too moist
4801 2018-05-01 14:31:40 From beer in the east to oil in the west and all points in between the primers are all using the courts. Carbon tax MB and SK is another example of the constitution crisis unfolding in real time. Sickening yet interesting . Canada has never been more divided and sick as a country
4802 2018-05-01 14:31:27 And other goods (wheat and grains) are being stuck in the prairies because they can't get access to trains.  This hurt Canadian farmers and contributes to higher food costs global.  

Too bad we can't build a grain pipeline and then the railway exclusive for oil?

4813 2018-05-01 14:30:50 Oil is trading business at about $70/ bbl. That's high relative to where we were like 11/2 ago. Aluminum is spiking because of Tariffs...

4828 2018-05-01 14:29:31 My reflection from last week's Stuff You'll Probably Like newsletter. Text was Psalm 23:5

"You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;
you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. -- Psalm 23:5"
4829 2018-05-01 14:29:29 Gotta drum up more military spending, excuses to raise oil prices for their buddies, and distract from collusion somehow.
4830 2018-05-01 14:29:29  3 hours is too much. unless you getting rubbed up with some oil, smoking and braiding your hair back to get ready to throw down
4831 2018-05-01 14:29:21 In March 2013 Oil price was $103 per barrel n now $67. What is the justification of increase in oil price? This is logic of FM that prices are Rs15 less then 2013 prices.
4832 2018-05-01 14:29:11 And more importantly to start a war and destabize the world (And push oil prices up).All down to one letter and a corrupt administration.

4840 2018-05-01 14:28:20 Sorry but the Smithers Mayor Taylor Bachrach is actually a star in the anti oil engo crowd. He’s even worked for Dogwood and Sierra Club in the past. Doubt he attended this rally

4873 2018-05-01 14:25:46 I don't see a very tight correlation between the changes in the market price of oil/barrel and the price of fuel at the pump
4874 2018-05-01 14:25:39 Merely producing Rice is a baby step towards Diversification. FX earnings from oil need to be less than 40% before we can say that we are a diversified economy. So you need to do economic analysis before you can say that we have diversified.

4881 2018-05-01 14:25:13 This is kind of a metaphor for people that want to pollute the air/environment that belongs to all of us without be taxed via carbon pricing measures.

4900 2018-05-01 14:23:05 I guess it’s time to organize a convoy of 1000 crude oil truckloads to head to Burnaby.  They all need to be lined up, and leave Abbotsford at 06:00 and stay in one line, bumper to bumper .  Plug up the roads down there,. Maybe they will get the hint.

4911 2018-05-01 14:21:53 This land has no doubt been in her family for generations. It might be undeveloped in that area but the government nor the oil company own it.

4915 2018-05-01 14:21:40 No, we should not repeal the vehicle and gas taxes. In fact, we should probably raise them to help fix our infrastructure. Its better to put this money where it will do some good rather than putting it in the pockets of the oil producers.
4916 2018-05-01 14:21:40 Nigeria is still dependent on Oil because over 70% of our FX earnings come from oil, we are still dependent on Oil, which is why FX rate is $1 to N360 If we diversify the FX rate wont be as high as that. Merely producing rice is only a baby step towards Diversification.

4927 2018-05-01 14:20:22 OK. It's losts of water, salt to taste, onions, a bit of cooking oil n about 6-8hours depending on how tender u want it. Then u serve 
4928 2018-05-01 14:20:19 Maybe the problem wasn't with registering a company. Maybe it's all the other things, like getting approval from NAFDAC. The fact that you have to oil so many palms to get regulators to do their jobs just make it so difficult to do business in Nigeria. Still, idiots.
4929 2018-05-01 14:20:18 It’s shaving cream or beard oil. Chris uses that brand
4930 2018-05-01 14:20:17 @POTUS What is up with these gas prices? We don’t need OPEC or Russian oil. We produce enough of our own. Price gouging is ridiculous!!! Over night it went from $2.65 to $2.95. I call BULLSHIT!!! At this rate, there will be a lot of “Stay-cations” this summer.

4936 2018-05-01 14:19:46 I haven't heard yet about the oil companies, but I will text him and find out. We need our and gas. Although the gas prices is rediculous. But they were under Obama also. We are w on that also.orking

4940 2018-05-01 14:19:12 But we are already exporting oil and earning foreign revenue, can we say we have diversified? No. So diversification means more than that, it means selling more than one product to earn money.
4941 2018-05-01 14:19:09 Unless oil being topped out & due for a pull back story works out. Only then INR can see appreciation bias. To put things in perspective, for every 10$ rise in oil , Current account deficit /GDP slips by 50~60 bps. For FY19, RBI estimates are at oil ~ 68. @Sunchartist @dugalira

4944 2018-05-01 14:18:53 I suspect that their media and politicians have rubbished Western oil to the point they actually believe it a good idea to buy import
4945 2018-05-01 14:18:46 She doesn't know (in fairness, no one does). But it doesn't really matter ... the point of the carbon tax is to make oil so expensive that the "green" alternatives the government wants you to use seem cheap in comparison. So, in that sense, the more gasoline costs the better.
4946 2018-05-01 14:18:45 Things I like about them: ingredients are cheap and I usually have most of them. Like, it calls for sesame oil, but it would be fine with just canola. Also it would not be the end of the world without scallions.

Had to look up benefits of coconut oil in found a cool life hack that you may need. Instead of storing it all in one jar, put coconut oil in to ice cube trays so you can just take out a pat at a time. Have a great day!

5044 2018-05-01 14:08:44 Justin... Yes, and it's even worse now.  Shale Oil & Gas companies Interest Expense continues to increase, thus they will need even more profits in the future.  I give it 1-3 years and we should start seeing the collapse of the U.S. Shale Energy Industry.

Seems they bought more when people said they would have sold.
In March 2018 the Company exercised warrants to acquire 1,000,000 shares in Eco (Atlantic) Oil & Gas Limited at a total cost of £176,000.
Now worth 330k.

5053 2018-05-01 14:07:53 And this report doesn’t include the new projected Suncor and Teck sites. I suggest you leave the market evaluations to the big, rich oil companies you hate so much. Their big and rich for a reason....they have a pretty good grasp of their market.

5083 2018-05-01 14:05:26 Trump + Saudi prince + Putin + Koch brothers (they own large tar sand deposit in Canada) all benefit from higher oil prices. Russian and the Saudis are oil economies.

5086 2018-05-01 14:04:33 Eigra is rite. But back to rules. You are blocked. 

Last question bcs I want to eat first
You have a barrel of oil, and you need to measure out just one gallon. How do you do this if you only have a three-gallon container and a five-gallon container?
5087 2018-05-01 14:04:33 I'd argue that the world NEEDS higher oil prices!
5088 2018-05-01 14:04:32 You don't have to smoke "rank ass weak shit" to microdose. You can ingest small amounts of a (preferably) high quality edible, or vape high quality oil.

Educate yourself.
5089 2018-05-01 14:04:28 They can't guarantee that. How many holes drilled? Dozens? It's not just a single hole in ocean floor. Miles of anchor chain & huge anchors dragged across ocean floor. If oil is discovered, then infrastructure installed on ocean floor. Then there's the seismic exploration aspect.
5090 2018-05-01 14:04:25 Laban and olive oil do not mix ya akhi
5091 2018-05-01 14:04:20 The pound has fallen by 1/3 and the latest GDP was 0.1%, ie. no growth. But how could i contradict the man who predicted oil would be worth $0 when it was at $25 and now $75 just 3 yrs later.
5092 2018-05-01 14:04:18 @CerebralMarv Hi! I want to make your mango coconut sticky rice recipe, but I was wondering how do you get the rice molded like in your pics?  Plastic rap? Do you oil a little ramekin?  Also, do you know if Chinese sticky rice will work?

Thank you!
5093 2018-05-01 14:04:09 must be from the oil and grease. i heat it works wonders
5094 2018-05-01 14:03:55 By that logic Canada would cease to cap any oil sands production. Extraction, delivery, refining & production of raw bitumen costs more & produces more emissions than light crude. Still this is all counter to the goal of accelerating a transition to a post-carbon global economy
5095 2018-05-01 14:03:53 you know what, I bet you could pan-sear tilapia in coconut oil. I think that would be a tasty non-controversial thing to do. Anyone ever tried it?
5096 2018-05-01 14:03:41 Yeah fuck that shithole of an industry. I'd do dedicated only if I did it again and cater to people worth my time. Also I'm starting a new job as a floorhand for a company that cases holes for oil wells before they start drilling.

5121 2018-05-01 14:01:27 I think it is reflective of the many people who have left the province after the oil price collapse. The ripple effect into service related industries forced staffing/hours cuts and many marginal earners returned “home”

5170 2018-05-01 13:56:02 Someone who expect people of your age to be objective. Where in Nigeria are people not suffering? Not even Lagos & some oil rich states. Ekiti is among the least owing states compare to many other counterparts. If u have to criticize, do that objectively. Buhari is a disgrace.
5171 2018-05-01 13:55:51 I know! But I really don’t even believe that oil is really the entire focus. I mean, sure it’s useful. But it’s not necessary. There are ppl dedicated af to finding other alternatives bc when the oil is gone then what? They are LOOKING for something. My guess is gold.

A few years back hubber peak oil at $150/barrel was the rage. Now it's pretty cheap. Meanwhile 2.5 billion ppl India and china have become consumers.

5202 2018-05-01 13:52:33 Umm... you barely made an attempt to make an economic case for Independence back in 2013–14 with the White Paper; which relied on hideously optimistic figures for oil (as a basis not a bonus!) and yet hardly broke even. That's one attempt—long way to go to a million.
5203 2018-05-01 13:52:29 $OVX Monday less than highest conviction rise? Opened 20-ticks above low of the day? But managed to lift 10.51% and closed at the high. Tentative built to more confident? April, #Oil up alongside $USD. Late telltale?
5204 2018-05-01 13:52:27 1MDB paid billions for an oilfield...paid to a company that is not even the rightful owner of the oil fields.And to date...that oilfield hv not produced a single drop of oil.

Where is that money paid for the non-existent asset?

Sorry...nothing to do with 1MDB.
5205 2018-05-01 13:52:25 It is a protected ecosystem. Two may not be exactly the same but where do you draw the line. How would you feel about drilling for oil in Gros Morne?
5206 2018-05-01 13:52:11 Alan.. you talk about Badger prospect being affected by the oil price several times ?  yet the RNS refers to Badger as being a Gas prospect?
5207 2018-05-01 13:52:02 I got so interested such that I thought of switching my usual brand cooking oil this month and try @RoilCooking especially on my veggies.

Good thing it looks rich and less refined 
5208 2018-05-01 13:52:00 You have been exploiting and abusing other countries for ages. It is offensive to watch you trying to say that now you care when the oil process is harmful.
5209 2018-05-01 13:51:53 Big Oil is nothing but Scumbags  , My buddy Leases his land to Oil in Texas and their pumps have not run in 5 months , They would rather buy on the open market , Their is no money in cheap Oil . Between Big Oil and Ethanol ripping USA off it pays to buy a Electric Car
5210 2018-05-01 13:51:44 Don't you know, the essence of being in govt and managing the economy for them is selling oil, oil and oil,then sharing the money, that's what being in govt and managing the economy is all about for this club of depraved minds,criminal minded individuals.

5219 2018-05-01 13:51:03 Donald was sworn in a barrel of oil was $32 today it is $68 increase of 112%. 
The right says the rising fuel cost is CA gas tax, they apparently don’t track the cost of oil. 
they just want to misdirect, then say drilling more will lower cost, we are the ones getting drilled

5222 2018-05-01 13:50:59 Well, they should sue Venezuela in Int'l court. They are an Oil rich Nation that nationalized all of the oil industry and it s funding needed to care for THIER people. The rest of the world should not be expected to pay when Maduro clan has the money in thier personal accts.
5223 2018-05-01 13:50:59 Gold Oil and Diamonds.... is that what you’re tryna feed me right now smh
5224 2018-05-01 13:50:53 If you’re right, isn’t this a self-reinforcing negative loop?  High debt & low cash flow would prohibit the required capital necessary to find and drill new wells (which would, in turn, produce positive FCF)?  Price of oil going higher is the only way out.

5234 2018-05-01 13:49:35 A good example is oil companies buying new technology and not deploying it. Companies that buy shelf space in supermarkets so cheaper competition can't get in front of consumers, using Monopoly profits to sell below coat until a new competitor goes broke then increasing margins

5244 2018-05-01 13:48:05 And someone is still going to produce oil but Canada will have lost it advantage and will b at the bottom of the pile 100’s of tankers already go down the west coast from Alaska,but it’s a liberal thing to hold the west’s oil and resources from getting out.time to leave

5247 2018-05-01 13:47:53 The purpose of fishing is to exploit the ecosystem. Oil drilling bypasses that ecosystem to extract oil from the earth. If things go as planned, there is zero damage to the environment. Oil industry is far from perfect, but there's a big difference in the two.

5253 2018-05-01 13:47:36 I got this same reaction back in 2014 when oil was trading at $107 and I forecast that it would fall to $40 within the next year. At that time the consensus was calling for higher oil prices just as they are today.

5290 2018-05-01 13:44:15 Oh dear!

5299 2018-05-01 13:43:41 "The grooviest and nastiest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even pursued - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
5300 2018-05-01 13:43:34 "[Oil refinery] much worst for the landscape if that’s your argument."

"But that’s just a purposefully ignorant argument. Of course wind does  not produce the same energy. That’s like comparing a nascar racing car  to a Volkswagen beatle - it’s stupid to even compare."

Exactly.

5302 2018-05-01 13:43:25 bihhhhhhhh im not gone have NO OIL !
5303 2018-05-01 13:43:12 Be it as it may, it was wise to dump the Fox brand early as you did. For hard news greatly suffered from a
 bias that promoted snake oil for the anal retentive consumer who disliked being confused with facts that conflicted their predisposed notions.

5307 2018-05-01 13:42:46 I have the same problem with my 5 month old does the Jamaican castor oil work on babies too?
5308 2018-05-01 13:42:28 I have one specific album I listen to when I'm losing it (if I can), which honestly has the biggest immediate effect out of anything. If I'm doing something I know will trigger it, I take lavender oil pills, which doesn't fix my brain but does seem to help with physical symptoms.

5311 2018-05-01 13:42:16 We just raised defense spending by over $300B. That’s a drop in the bucket. And the reason they are getting paid is for oil that they gave already. We’re basically releasing their funds.
5312 2018-05-01 13:42:05 Who owns the North Sea oil companies?  Isn't it all private, foreign based companies?  Therefore if the North Sea is badly managed it is down to them.

5317 2018-05-01 13:41:43 The oil refineries are in Tampa so it’s cheaper the closer you get to Tampa.
5318 2018-05-01 13:41:37 Woohoo for big blue!
5319 2018-05-01 13:41:33 It’s all about overtime engagement and letting capitalism work it’s magic. We keep them neutral and let them be a power in the ME . We do business, import oil and gas, hedge Russia and KSA and we will be ok.

5322 2018-05-01 13:41:20 You forgot taxes. Very important component of fuel prices. Also, if you think there is price gouging you should buy shares of refiners and integrated oil companies.
5323 2018-05-01 13:41:17 Oh I agree. And believe me the rest was mostly psychobabble BS about finding inner happiness and shit. It’s like “bro, you’re a wealthy man married to a wealthier woman, go peddle your snake oil elsewhere “

5327 2018-05-01 13:40:48 SP2628 the sweet spot. Big oil needs to 66 handle many moving pieces but opportunites abound
5328 2018-05-01 13:40:48 Denominated in barrels, could be worse but key problem (other than default) is inability to pump oil as fast as people can want to redeem the credits...

5338 2018-05-01 13:39:47 Today I was getting an oil change and someone from corporate called me. They turned on my car in the middle of the call and my Bluetooth connected... he thought I hung up on him 
5339 2018-05-01 13:39:46 Oh please, the companies @IPAAaccess rep spill oil, destroy land and poison the very water we need to live. Oh, and their little kiss-ass comments about cities don’t cover up their “iconic” crimes against humanity.
5340 2018-05-01 13:39:34 I don’t want to see big oil companies fail. I want to see them let the cases against them proceed in the court of law rather than court of public opinion, and put their resources towards transitioning business to clean 21st century energy.

5342 2018-05-01 13:39:08 Again, oil companies get NO subsidies. None. You’re just discrediting yourself more when you make this stuff up.
5343 2018-05-01 13:38:58 Is this acrylic or oil?
5344 2018-05-01 13:38:53 That Scott Pruitt’s EPA would grant billionaire Carl Icahn’s oil refinery a waiver saving millions of dollars in costs should come as no surprise to anyone. What is surprising is the lack of unbridled outrage from the public and politicians. It’s the f*cking EPA for God’s sake.
5345 2018-05-01 13:38:53 I can't give you that Davido assurance only assurance I can give you is oil change for your car at least it will drive like Chioma's new Porsche

5354 2018-05-01 13:37:36 It is not a zero risk activity - it is a managed risk activity. We should protect at least 10% of our offshore under Aichi. Just not the 0.7% that likely contains $500B in oil.
5355 2018-05-01 13:37:31 Desde hace un tiempo veo publicidad  en medios escritos y electrónicos de "SEA KRILL OIL" aceite de krill de mar...  llegar al pto. de matar  de hambre (ballenas) es que equivocamos totalmente el camino

5356 2018-05-01 13:37:09 Trump complains that the Chinese and Russians are devaluing their currency and the price of oil is too high. How does the market react? Strengthens the #USD even more and pushes #CrudeOil near a 4 year high. This isn't quite going to plan for the Donald.
5357 2018-05-01 13:37:06 You are right about economic reaction. But for whatever reason Liberal voters prefer arts degrees over economics degrees. The carbon tax is a wedge to encourage alt energy options, cool. Except when the entire economy relies on oil for transporting goods and the CPI will blow up.

5364 2018-05-01 13:36:21 Coconut oil is 60% medium chain triglycerides (MCT) which, through the liver, are rapidly turned into ketones.  Ketones, reduce appetite and enhance energy and endurance.  Start slow and build up to 1 Tbs  3 x day.
5365 2018-05-01 13:36:17 Saudi Arabia thanks U.S. vets for their service in the creation of the largest oil company takeover in middle eastern history. With Iraq and Iran out of the way they are now free to become a monopoly on oil.

OPEC tightens production. 
Cold weather. 
Higher wages for oil workers. 
Trans Mountain Pipeline. 

It's all B.S. 

In reality it's just a price gouge money grab.

5378 2018-05-01 13:35:28 Interesting you bring it up. The Akademik Lomonosov is part of a plan to bring in a fleet of floating nuclear power stations to power.... oil, gas and coal extraction in the Arctic. Not the kind of activity supported by the IPCC. BTW, the IPCC does not endorse any technology.
5379 2018-05-01 13:35:18 What difference does it make if you give the energy consumed in oil equivalent or Terawatts? It's a measure of Energy. 

And I don't quite understand why you would need to compare the first and third graph for anything

5383 2018-05-01 13:35:09 The trend is an uptick in oil demand worldwide.  So yes, businesses can plan for that - because of futures trading they won't actually see $$ until at least June.  But the same businesses are saving tax $$ now.  That impacts investment.

Since last month Iran's currency lost its value %33 & since yesterday it got worse. All the oil trades should be in US dollars & only US sanction can break Iran's economy.

5423 2018-05-01 13:31:55 Charging a carbon tax on a people who have to heat their homes is heartless. Power Bill's are already too high and to fill your oil tank is also expensive. This is a just plain punishing Canadians.

5435 2018-05-01 13:30:24 Castor oil + coconut oil works amazingly!!
5436 2018-05-01 13:30:23 Oil companies are manipulating gas prices.
Oil prices go down gas prices go up.
Oil prices go up gas prices go up.
Oil supply is controlled by the Oil industry & Gas production & Distribution.
Call your MP and MLA and tell them to break the monopoly. It's about time.
5437 2018-05-01 13:30:20 Is the oil in there slightly dark? Do the ingredients list Propylene glycol?

5441 2018-05-01 13:30:00 My 13 year old has come home multiple times and was visibly upset about some far left liberal bullshit that her teacher spouted off to the class. 

Pretty gross what’s happening.
5442 2018-05-01 13:29:58 Oil&gas are booming. And dirty carbon emissions bomb we’re making in atmosphere having increasingly shocking ‘boom’. Our kids lives are being sacrificed to keep CO2 polluter privileges we don’t need. Brain damage did this.

5446 2018-05-01 13:29:48 @ieServe I tot you said you dont accept bribe? Our transformer had a little issue, they said it was leaking oil. So we called ur staff and they came wit a ladder but refused to work bcos according to them they hired the ladder & work tools. So they were indirectly asking 4 bribe
5447 2018-05-01 13:29:38 How much subsides were paid to Oil Sands companies last year?
5448 2018-05-01 13:29:34 Let’s see, chaos in the White House, chaos in the financial markets, chaos in the oil markets, confusion amongst our allies - you’re doing a great job trumpy boy. Keep it up.

5452 2018-05-01 13:29:02 ...and the idiotic name you propose - "Greater Britannia"?  What about "Greater Hibernia"? Put the capital in Dublin and overall Presidency goes to Irish head of State?  
Sorry pal, history shows us God kept our islands separate for a reason. Oil and water don't mix.
5453 2018-05-01 13:28:55 Let's see, minimum wage warehouse jobs vs high paying oil patch jobs, seems like a fair trade?
5454 2018-05-01 13:28:38 @MBuhari you signed to import from us but can't make them to buy Oil.

5463 2018-05-01 13:27:26 Coconut oil all over my skin every day 
5464 2018-05-01 13:27:22 did you read the article? the scientists explain pretty clearly why this area in particular needs protection (not all 0.7 percent patches of the ocean are interchangeable) and why oil exploration actually is harmful to the marine wildlife in question
5465 2018-05-01 13:27:14 Shriman ji ek baar bhi aapne ye socha tab crude oil 130 ka q tha aur aaj sasta kaise hua nhi. Jo paise humse congress ne kamaye wo to apni bhalai me lagaye. Aap agar businessman hain to sochiye aap koi cheej agar sasti bechenge to kise jo paisa turant deta hai use ya jo paisa
5466 2018-05-01 13:27:08 I didn’t even mention the cabals and cartels of the power and oil sector, does he think they can be dismantled by fiat? Or by motivational speeches

5468 2018-05-01 13:26:45 You know the answer to that question ... Trump paying back his donors.  It’s a free for all again in the oil  & gas business. Look what happened to the price at the pump after Pres. Obama called the oil co. CEO’S to the carpet. Plain & simple Greed !!
5469 2018-05-01 13:26:43 initial mental warning bells going off, people internally starting to talk about oil going to $100.......

5477 2018-05-01 13:25:31 Keep in mind the epa just gave an oil company friend of trump’s a hardship excuse, who’s really the welfare queens? We spend much more as citizens on corporate welfare than we do on our own fellow citizens
5478 2018-05-01 13:25:25 The article mentions that short term fluctuations in oil prices don't have much impact on investment, however, clearly the increase in oil prices since the beginning of the year has meant more money flowing into North Dakota.
5479 2018-05-01 13:25:18 Maybe it will make it bigger... keep the little displays of all Obama’s “accomplishments” then have 2/3 of the place discuss how it all was either a failure or based on lies or both
5480 2018-05-01 13:25:08 I’m over today already I had to buy 3 new tires, get an oil change, pay my rent for my old place and pay my rent for my new place, car note and insurance but I’m so grateful that I have a job to be able to pay for all my needs

5484 2018-05-01 13:24:27 The real enemy of the American people are the Zionist central bankers, the CIA, Mossad, multinational oil companies etc. The mainstream media creates these phony enemies like Russia to divert our attention.
5485 2018-05-01 13:24:26 I believe I will have the chance to address this point fully  @VOCMOpenline tomorrow morning. We don’t open pit mine in the offshore. The risk of offshore oil and gas is well know, well managed, and even encourages coral development in some cases. Not comparable to trawling.

Israel happy and didn't have to pay for any of it. 
Saudis happy because oil prices go crazy.
5497 2018-05-01 13:23:00 Idk why you mention this as if having oil alone is enough to bring wealth. They are subject to global oil prices and their ability to refine the oil they have. Now they could have a private company do all that for them but they have opted to control their own resources

5500 2018-05-01 13:22:32 As is the discovery of shale oil probably. However you only hear the Fed urged to ignore "one-off" factors when they are in tightening mode.

5502 2018-05-01 13:22:07 What about exports to Europe? Traditionally Iran exports to Europe destinations are conformed by Iran heavy crude oil, Is it still like that? Do you think these exports are going to be affected by the posible sanctions?
5503 2018-05-01 13:22:04 President Trump make these oil companies have a backup plan in case of an oil spill, what they will do to immediately clean up.NOT IMPRESSED with companies n past!

5512 2018-05-01 13:21:14 Key things ATK tells you to do: the oil that you use to laminate should be mixed with some flour, cut a steam hole, use a lid, sprinkle middle with salt
5513 2018-05-01 13:21:13 $BP rose to their highest level since the immediate aftermath of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, boosted by frothy oil prices.

5527 2018-05-01 13:20:04 BP said its Q1 earnings surged 70% due to rising oil prices and increased production. The company reported net income of $2.47B, up from $1.45B in the same period last year, via @AP

5543 2018-05-01 13:18:37 I been called a rig pig since I started in 1978. It’s what people outside the Oil Business used to try and elevate their social standing because we had more money than them. Now they use the environment, despite Oil and Gas people being way more responsible and aware.

5550 2018-05-01 13:17:58 I saw that they are close to make an oil w/ MJ that doesn't hve the high. They use another oil from the plant that relaxes you without the high. Instead of THC I think it is CDS. It was on my local news about a week ago. Plus you dont hve to smoke it, no lung problems that way

5564 2018-05-01 13:16:55 Not even paprika. I think that would have made it too 'zesty'. Just imagine a bunch of oil and a bit of green Kool-aid powder, and you're on the right track.
5565 2018-05-01 13:16:38 Why do you think we left Recession?
It's because of the Oil Price mainly. The IMF have said the main reason we left Recession was because the Oil Price came up.
IMF released a report that Nigeria's economy is still very much dependent on oil. They haven't done much to Diversify
5566 2018-05-01 13:16:37 Venezuela simultaneously has one of the highest known oil reserves in the world and masses of people starving while food rots in warehouses.

There is nothing like that in the US or Canada or Japan or western Europe or any other capitalist country.

So we called ur staff and they came wit a ladder but refused 2 work bcos according to them they hired the ladder & work tools. So they were indirectly asking 4 bribe
5589 2018-05-01 13:15:05 @LeBatardShow Why rail on NFL for being dangerous when Oil Rig Workers and countless others make F A R less money and work in more dangerous conditions. It's not just that NFL players make millions, it's that tougher people make less for more risk. #itsgettingold #soRu

5600 2018-05-01 13:14:15 More feedback is that the pizzas were excellent but we felt that the whole restaurant smelt of cooked oil which lingered on our clothes after we left.
5601 2018-05-01 13:14:12 Ok. I’ve decided. Back to old eating habits. Protein and veggies, all day all night protein party

I’m gonna roast some chicken, and separately, radishes tonight and toss them with some olive oil and chives and then eat them with feta 
5602 2018-05-01 13:14:12 History repeating itself? I see some overheating in the making and evaluations getting too high for sound returns... #oil #credit #subprime #overleveraging.

5606 2018-05-01 13:13:53 I've tried a couple of different ways. The effect has been getting more pronounced over time - it used to be mostly fine but occasionally a problem when roast (just oil and salt). These days it's sometimes OK if boiled but it's a bit Russian roulette.
5607 2018-05-01 13:13:51 I’m shaved and moisturized. I’ve got chapstick on my lips. I’ve consumed a hefty amount of water in the last few days. I have rose hip oil AND rose water on my face rn.

In conclusion: I’m ready to turn my life around.

5610 2018-05-01 13:13:44 When oil went to 29-30 $ a barrel, the Govt didn't pass on that dip to the retail. That was not coloured as election centric move. Has that bought the Govt some room to absorb some rise now?

That along with some oils she made and blessed both. She told me keep my stone close to me at all times and take the oil and drop some in my apartment
5618 2018-05-01 13:12:49 And I have to turn the gas stove eye off if I spill any oil around it and wipe it up immediately. Ain’t taking no chances

5642 2018-05-01 13:10:31 Perfect. MP Nick “Eat Less Fish” Whalen has spoken. The idea of drilling for oil in a preservation area is about as stunned as it gets. It’s set aside for a reason, and that reason is not to make it easier to destroy with a drilling accident.

5670 2018-05-01 13:08:24 Not to mention the oil & gas industry freely holds back supply, freely raises prices on their whim, freely manipulates when, where and how we're "allowed" to buy.
5671 2018-05-01 13:08:21 .@jiffylube failed to change gasket during Friday’s oil change so now oil is leaking all over the garage floor. They offered to fix the problem IF I BUY ANOTHER OIL CHANGE. Great business model: create a problem, then charge to solve it. #sarasota #jiffylubesucks

5682 2018-05-01 13:07:38 The gas supply is there. If BC wanted a refinery to share with Washington do they realize it would be the same oil? Just cost more bringing it from the states. The oil companies make those calls.

5689 2018-05-01 13:06:47 @narendramodi tweet of 2012 when he was Gujart CM in regards to PETROL PRICE.

Petrol price per litre in 2012 was 80rs and Crude oil per barrel was $100.

Now in 2018, Crude oil rate is $40 and petrol price is 75.82 RS in BANGALORE(CONGRESS RULE)  & 82.48 RS in MUMBAI(BJP RULE).

Nope.  Just wind.  That was the topic.

Nope.  Only said that an oil refinery produces more energy than wind does per sq ft

Our energy resources should have us as the cheapest place in the western world to do business.
FACT
5717 2018-05-01 13:03:39 Yes indeed the American oil industry was betrayed.
The agreement isnot between Iran and the US.
Pulling out of it to satisfy the globalists is not good for America, not good for the world and not good for Israel (except for the corrupt Israeli oligarchs)
5718 2018-05-01 13:03:34 Again, electric needs batteries, batteries require lithium, and cobalt which requires little kids to mine it. Not acceptable. And producing green products still! requires! oil! Think people!!

What is the most widely used edible oil in the United States?
5727 2018-05-01 13:02:49 今日はスピアーです
5728 2018-05-01 13:02:49 I agree with you here too. Oil is likely topping and will ultimately head for new lows. I expect oil to trade as low as $10 in the coming bust. Likely to stay in a trading range between high 50's & $70 for the next few months but from there a much steeper sell-off.
5729 2018-05-01 13:02:46 The ban on use of heavy fuel oil (as bunkers) and hopefully even for its carriage (as cargo) in Arctic region should be implemented and enforced at the earliest #Shipping but  policing the Arctic region is not easy to ensure full compliance & a polluting accident is inevitable

It works as long as economic expansion can be sustained, but when inflation is rising and economic contraction is necessary, socialist governments tend to fail miserably.

5788 2018-05-01 12:57:54 It does mean they pump far less now. As oil sales were 25 % of State revenues in prewar 2010 , that's meaningful.

5831 2018-05-01 12:50:21 Because it isn’t. Venezuela is still capitalist. The reason Venezuela is in the state that it is today is because of the decrease in global oil prices, which the Venezuelan economy is heavily dependent on.

5848 2018-05-01 12:46:27 @OilSheppard " global crude consumption expected to top 100m b/d" - this is definitely wrong. Say "liquids", say "oil", but don't say "crude". Global crude demand is around 80-85m b/d right now (partly depends on if you count condensate as crude).

5851 2018-05-01 12:46:06 By your logic, if your tax rate gets lowered somehow the government is subsidizing you? How does the oil and gas industry pay billions of dollars into federal and provincial coffers if the government is paying them?

5854 2018-05-01 12:45:33 The oil is being produced and will be shipped one way or another. Protesters may slow the installation of a pipeline but they cannot slow production. Pipelines are more economically viable than trains as well as being environmentally safer and cleaner.

All you have to do is avoid oily food. That is number one rule. Sure you can treat yourself once a week with oily foods. 

2, use an oil based face cleanser. It'll soothe your skin after you wore heavy make up for your scheds during day time

5986 2018-05-01 12:30:30 Saudi and Russia are part of the higher gas prices. Crude oil is barreling towards $70 a barrel. This is boosting the Saudi economy.
5987 2018-05-01 12:30:24 Lol, proves how ignorant some tweets can b, Nigeria was sold 2 US since SAP, Nigeria cannot export agric products since US have excess/cheaper food, and they stopped buying our oil since they discovered vast reserves of oil. This was all b4 Buhari, so he can only follow protocol.
5988 2018-05-01 12:30:13 Oil will likely hit $100 a barrel, about the same time @Ford ceases selling the Focus & Fusion in the US. 
Ford's now being led by a Furniture Guy!
5989 2018-05-01 12:30:03 Oh,so America is not aware Nigeria has crude oil??!These people are sickening
5990 2018-05-01 12:30:02 Burning the MIDNIGHT OIL should never be for nothing but something totally worth!!! Don't do it if you won't do it...!!
5991 2018-05-01 12:29:52 Starting a war with Iran so OIL billionaires can have more?
5992 2018-05-01 12:29:46 Tax-breaks given to the Oil Companies in the First place to explore for more Oil ..

So moan about Subsidies for Solar Panels, if you must, but DON'T forget to moan about the far bigger subsidies given to Carbon Fuel Companies as well !

5996 2018-05-01 12:29:23 @JustinTrudeau Gas prices across the country are becoming a problem. OPEC is at 71$ a barrel but the price of gas in MTL just hit 1.48/L. Something needs to be done to keep money in our pockets instead of putting more into oil and gas shareholder pockets. It makes no sense.
5997 2018-05-01 12:29:23 Jason, Sadly you are not based in reality. Building a refinery would be supported by zero of your foreign funded eco terrorist friends. Exporting our Gay friendly oil will save  lives. #LGBTQ

6009 2018-05-01 12:27:33 i think snake oil salesman like #stElon don't actually think they're telling lies. They just genuinely believe their own BS so much it comes across as them being really good at it over time.
6010 2018-05-01 12:27:31 @Morning_Joe “The EPA has granted a financial hardship waiver to an oil refinery owned by billionaire Carl Icahn, a former adv to Pres D Trump, exempting the OK facility from requirements under a federal biofuels law.” This and HUD rent increase instead of roast by comedienne.
6011 2018-05-01 12:27:25 Saudi increases oil reserves by 10 billion barrels. Bloomberg says we are awash in oil. Just to be clear, that “massive” adjustment is less than 3 years of Saudi current production.  We are going to hit a wall on supply folks.
6012 2018-05-01 12:27:25 Significance of the Northeast Newfoundland Slope to the future of our oil and gas industry can’t be overstated. Simultaneously, we need to protect the coral. Norway and Scotland set the standard; and we should be as diligent or more than they have been. #sustainabledevelopment
6013 2018-05-01 12:27:23 Sue, This is good news. Although, Oil demand will continue to increase for more than 20 years. Obstructing Kinder Morgan only enriches dictators from regimes that toss #LGBTQ from buildings. Canada’s Gay friendly, Feminist Oil should be shared with the world. @ctvqp @PrideToronto

6016 2018-05-01 12:26:49 Well, if oil is public, how then is Mrs Alakija the richest woman?

Or is Chevron a FGN parastatal?

Are Airtel and Eko Hotels public companies because Lagos State Govt owns shares in them?

Being adminsitered by Govt and being public are different things.

6019 2018-05-01 12:26:26 I keep hearing “data is the new oil” but we must be wary it’s not snake oil when it comes to healthcare. First lesson of stats - garbage in, garbage out, no matter how Big the data.

6023 2018-05-01 12:25:50 I use Neutrogena visibly clear pink grapefruit range ( it's for oily skin)

And then if I feel like I need to add moisture back I use Garnier hydra boost moisturizer or dove dermaspa oil (it's a body oil but I like it on my face too) 
6024 2018-05-01 12:25:46 i hate how disrespectful that bitch is. no matter how high ur self-esteem is or how many oil companies your daddy has, u always have to be respectful of human rights and specifically the right to privacy okay bitch
6025 2018-05-01 12:25:41 I accept that challenge. Let’s compare Scotland with another small northern nation with oil fields eg Norway
6026 2018-05-01 12:25:14 Homemade mayo, 4 ingredients, eggs, oil, lemon, salt. Duke’s uses vinegar instead of lemon, adds paprika. Miracle Whip adds high fructose corn syrup, corn starch, mustard flour & potassium sorbate. Also uses hydrogenated oil.

6028 2018-05-01 12:24:57 This is a reminder that one should be suspicious of Sam Madani and Tanker Trackers. So how does he make money? Who funds him? How did he get into the OPEC meeting last fall? Ask him all this and watch him not be able to answer #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F
6029 2018-05-01 12:24:46 Why the only intel informations are presented to the public of the world-the world community- to justify illegal and criminal wars of Western states against  sovereign nations reach in oil and gas or gold?

6031 2018-05-01 12:24:31 That’s my problem too. I now mix it with coconut ( a little, because it blocks your pores). When it start to cool I mix tissue oil. It’s a little bit better now.
6032 2018-05-01 12:24:30 @MarymanDZ hello dear valerie
as i am interested in your thesis about the effect of PMBok on project success factor, i am going to expand this research in oil and gas industry , therefore is it possible to send the questionnaire and other essential data to do so? thanks a lot

6040 2018-05-01 12:24:05 Yeah, private banks and oil companies and mega farms definitely absolutely surely have no government subsidies propping them up in the US because that would be socialism, right? It's that old socialist mantra "Direct public funds to the captains of industry for private gain!"
6041 2018-05-01 12:24:05 Fold in five cups of olive oil then allow to simmer.
6042 2018-05-01 12:23:51 Is sitting at my kitchen table with a loaf of sourdough bread and a bowl of olive oil + balsamic vinegar considered binge eating?
6043 2018-05-01 12:23:45 And my point is wide, high profile, economic protest events always attract a handful of opportunistic violence, so you get preemptive policing, a counter-escalation, which throws the core protestors off message, to the protesters advantage. “Oil? All I saw were vandals.”
6044 2018-05-01 12:23:30 I can't believe she actually wrote over 100 about toxic masculinity. I couldn't even think of 1 thing.

6048 2018-05-01 12:23:06 Have you bought gas lately?  When will its price get so high it slows down our economy? Our allies have reduced production and oil prices are going up. Everyone is making money except the little guy/gal commuters.
6049 2018-05-01 12:22:56 わいも年重ねたらいいんか！！！！
6050 2018-05-01 12:22:53 you don't seem to realize that all sides have the same obective -- find a replacement for dwindling crude oil supplies
6051 2018-05-01 12:22:53 General Miguna, @RailaOdinga called the boycott. He's seen it fit to call it off. Just call your presser and call your own boycott and the intended products/companies.

6052 2018-05-01 12:22:52 Many Australian farmers are on struggle street & the government borrows millions of dollars to give foreign aid to islamic nations. You have lost the plot @TurnbullMalcolm Oil rich Saudi Arabia should be giving the foreign aid instead of financing the building of mosques in Aust.
6053 2018-05-01 12:22:48 Doesn't matter as there won't be any blue flag beaches in the UK once we "take back control", we can look forward to the raw sh1t on the beaches and crude oil ruining our towels again
6054 2018-05-01 12:22:44 Lobbying for the Iranian Islamist regime will become a crime. Right now, the regime still has power and dictate over the oil and gas. Germany and Democrats protects their lobbyists.

6095 2018-05-01 12:17:16 I'm only just learning about them (apparently the guy who owns it has a daughter who opened a whole foods place too, so there seems to be a trend). Not sure palm oil issue is as easy as just stopping using it, but it's positive, all the same.
6096 2018-05-01 12:17:09 But once again, it's made at the expense of #kurds. It's the "price" due to the "alliance" of kurds and US. Well, it's mostly US taking advantage of kurdish blood to fight deash, control syrian oil fields and leave kurds alone in #afrin. kurds have been tricked, again.

6125 2018-05-01 12:13:56 Melatonin. I’ll bring you some this weekend. Lavender oil on the pillow helps also.
6126 2018-05-01 12:13:51 I wonder how long you’d have to use one for for it effectively pay for itself in reduced oil usage, prob less than a year at that price. Thanks for the tip.

6137 2018-05-01 12:11:23 That's what the oil ministry is claiming, but I'm skeptical. 2.62m b/d pure crude exports is definitely a high since well before the implementation of sanctions in 2012. But I'm looking into that at the moment.

Here's to power, money, weapons, oil!

6149 2018-05-01 12:10:01 It’s those noise ordinances that forced the end of air (oil) cooled engines in cars. 

To make up for the loss of distinct “notes” sports makers engineer fake engine sounds.

6153 2018-05-01 12:09:09 I've done all those.  Lightly stuck stuff comes off great with sea salt and you don't have to re-season the pan. If you add new oil to re-season, don't forget to heat the pan to smoking so the oil doesn't go rancid between uses.
6154 2018-05-01 12:08:35 @Nigella_Lawson I’m wanting to bake your banana chocolate muffins, would it be ok do you think to use olive oil instead of vegetable oil as we don’t have any of that? Thanks x

6160 2018-05-01 12:07:51 @realDonaldTrump when will the US be dependent on our own fuel sources? Getting gauged at the pumps! Oil companies still achieving large profits on the backs of the American public!!!
6161 2018-05-01 12:07:40 all you've got is lies and misinformation that reinforce in your delusion. If you wanna see 'oil, bread and flour' buying votes look no further than Sisi's recent 'elections'. Also what evidence on youtube are you talking about? Hopefully not fabrications by the Egyptian 'media'.
6162 2018-05-01 12:07:40 tbsp spoon of oil is like 150 calories so if you are constantly cooking and trying out recipes its very easy to pile on the pounds if you arent getting out and about.

Never go against a strong man/country (USA). God gifted your country with oil resources. Pls use them for the growth of your country. Give your nuclear weapons.Wish to see Iran competing with UAE and Saudi in Tourism.
6172 2018-05-01 12:05:52 Running out of water would be significantly worse as seen by countries who already have this problem and are malnourished bc water is a "basic need" so while oil is a need it's not a "basic need" #RidgeSocSem4

6222 2018-05-01 12:00:33 I agree with Delanie, to go to other power sources like solar or water, there would be a lot of converting and for countries who relied on oil for the countries income wouldn’t have money for these sources. Economies would be destroyed.  #RidgeSocSem4

6228 2018-05-01 12:00:01 So we agree that the landscape is worse with refineries then. Moving on, when a malfuncation happens with oil platforms, who ecosystems gets damaged. The golf course, the lake that belonged to the native Americans (actual Americans), etc. habitats destroyed every year for this.
6229 2018-05-01 11:59:58 Beard oil is expensive
6230 2018-05-01 11:59:48 Always been the way. Remember how Alex salmond lied to the Scottish voters over oil

6233 2018-05-01 11:59:34 Death to our government. Not the people. Rightly so. In 1953, CIA staged a coup called operation ajax, and installed a leader that was sympathetic to British oil interests. Naturally, these kinds of acts leave a bad taste in the mouths of citizenry... And aren't forgotten...

6240 2018-05-01 11:58:58 No doubt you do, Doug.  But in the MF experience they collectively made some truly classic decision-making mistakes at every level.  And some of the economic stuff just flat-out dismissed credible evidence that contradicted the high oil assumptions.

6249 2018-05-01 11:58:28 I agree with Max and Logan. The world is changing everyday. The world has advanced so much already. 83% of the world has just started consuming oil. If over half the world just started using oil I think we have enough time to find alternatives. #RidgeSocSem4
6250 2018-05-01 11:57:59 Brilliant isn't it ?

A domestic raw resource, in the wrong hands of evil & greed inflating the finalized public price in all oil  products !

Why is Argentina's public price way less
for it's own resource on oil needs, rewarding to it's citizens ?

Ah YA !

6265 2018-05-01 11:56:15 Another day, another lengthy section down. Think a healthy dose of midnight oil is needed tonight to get to the end of this chapter, possibly the next one. This book is a fair bit longer than I ever planned it to be... #amwriting #amediting

6270 2018-05-01 11:56:06 They make their own money. Your club was field by an oil fraud.
6271 2018-05-01 11:56:05 I’m not sure that a world without oil would cause a world war it would just cause us to find new ways of living. We would have to grow our own food and live in a smaller community where we help each other  #ridgesocsem4
6272 2018-05-01 11:55:54 The wealth of a nation is not the result of oil, gold mines, industries, rivers and resources, but the wisdom of its people. Fools can destroy everything but their own foolishness.
6273 2018-05-01 11:55:49 How do you expect me to credit you with intellect, when you are comparing a corrupt, south american dictatorship which relies entirely on its vast oil reserves and where he replaced the skilled technicians at oil refineries with stooges...  with the UK?
6274 2018-05-01 11:55:41 In Sarnia’s Chemical Valley, is ‘toxic soup’ making people sick?
Experts and documents cast doubts on whether industry and Ontario government are revealing levels of benzene in areas where residents live right near oil and gas facilities.
6275 2018-05-01 11:55:36 Why so eager ship oil out to be refined in places with lesser labour and environmental standards vs long tem jobs making value added product in Canada?

6286 2018-05-01 11:54:39 New report shows that @DinosaurNPS creates $20 million in economic benefit for the region. Supports over 200 jobs. Certainly better than the boom and bust of oil and gas.

6291 2018-05-01 11:54:19 Things are way better for me. My investments and 401k took a leap since the election. I do get a little more in my check. Taxes about the same. Big difference is I work in oil field making way more money! We love Trump. Pruitt best EPA director ever! Give him a plane!

6296 2018-05-01 11:53:38 @POTUS please Mr. President, can Washington do anything to help with the gas prices before they get out of hand? The money I saved on tax reform is going into my gas tank and some. This doesn’t MAGA, this makes us dependent slaves to the oil of the Middle East again.

6300 2018-05-01 11:53:20 According to IEA Oil Market Report there is an average demand of 96 million barrels of oil per day. More than 6,000 products we have on the daily use oil. Based off this thousands of products will no longer exist and lifestyles would change.  #RidgeSocSem4
6301 2018-05-01 11:53:08 Yet Canada is one of the worlds biggest oil producers . Hmmm , I wonder what the problem could be ... Oh , right , we are taxed to death to pay for the liberals handouts to rapefugees and other oppressive governments , while ignoring Canadians.

6309 2018-05-01 11:51:37 Guys, I need some advice with cbd- does anyone vape/ take this oil and are you still taking others meds with it for chronic pain and other chronic illnesses? 

I’m researching right now and I’m tempted to try but honestly I’m a bit baffled. #chronicillness #spoonie
6310 2018-05-01 11:51:35 Within the last days of oil, I believe people would begin to actually implement the idea of “every man for themselves”. We had a mini view of this back during the Hurricane season. #RidgeSocSem4

6313 2018-05-01 11:50:53 I need an oil change 
6314 2018-05-01 11:50:40 Everyone should listen to Jimmy Carters famous speech saying the world would be out of oil by the year 2000. What an idiot.
6315 2018-05-01 11:50:32 could maybe use that oil.......

6317 2018-05-01 11:50:13 Trump will "donate" Vietnam war era helicopters on exchange for oil.

Brand new Rooivalk helicopters will be too expensive for the corrupt Nigerian generals.
6318 2018-05-01 11:50:10 Imma take a pic of the things I use when I get home. But I use a facial cleanser, serum, moisturizer and Argan oil and just added sunscreen to my routine. Most of it is Neutrogena products.
6319 2018-05-01 11:50:01 It’s hard to recognize and accept the inevitable consequences of monetary inflation and central planning when your entire profession and reputation rests on the importance of centrally planning an inflationary currency.

6322 2018-05-01 11:49:35 Jason you do realize energy costs will escalate as Nations attempt to rebalance our input and output. We’re past the tipping point. Ask our farmers and ranchers. Ask maritimers.  Did you really think oil is renewable?  Quality of life needs us to change thinking. We can do this
6323 2018-05-01 11:49:32 ya struck oil
6324 2018-05-01 11:49:29 @realDonaldTrump Israel wants to expand their territory into Levanon and Syria and a war with Iran would allow them to do so at the expense of the USA. Israel uses the deep state for their benefit.  We will not benefit from another oil war w Iran.

6332 2018-05-01 11:48:54 a world without oil would mark many new beginnings #ridgesocsem4
6333 2018-05-01 11:48:51 #RidgeSocSem4 it would be no mad max scene, but it would be different. Alternative energy sources would be put in place and we would just rely on those until we perfected a certain source of energy to fully replace oil.

6344 2018-05-01 11:47:16 What makes you think it's any different for Syria now? 

Iraq based on oil interests.
Syria based on geopoliticallly strategic gas pipeline related interests.

Desire is so strong for regime change that the lies of Western propaganda war will have no limits, just like with Iraq.

6353 2018-05-01 11:46:06 Nigeria was the world's largest producer of palm oil. Nigerians abandoned palm oil because of crude oil.
6354 2018-05-01 11:45:52 @realDonaldTrump Remember when Bibi Netanyahu announced that Irag was in the process of making nuclear WMD and George Bush believed him and took us to war that destabilized the middle east, cost us the lives of many American young men and trillions of US treasure - all for oil???

6543 2018-05-01 11:18:30 And top of the morning to you , as well ! As an aside , did you see where Venezuela offered to give India a thirty percent discount on oil - if they made payment in the Petro ?
6544 2018-05-01 11:18:23 If a torch costs 2 million then its a rare antique....we should be able to shine light at the crossroads to see the future, it should give us signal. That torch should not need oil to burn eternally....
6545 2018-05-01 11:18:20 This is the while purpose of putting Trump in office. They need oil prices to go up.  Their investments haven't increased, loans are due soon, Russia has oil, global warming gives them access, etc.

Oil & gas isn't going to save us. 

It's a 30-year plan 
that will do 300 years of damage.

We have to think of something else.

6572 2018-05-01 11:13:36 Until they stop using 90% of income tax money for the oligarchs usury/oil wars and invest in 21 century physical science and physical economy we shouldn’t pay a dime

6574 2018-05-01 11:13:12 And now Alberta is in the crapper thanks to years of squandering their oil wealth on no PST. You are incredibly naive if you think that Dofo will put more money in your pocket. You may pay less tax, but you'll lose that advantage to fees for services that are now free.

6589 2018-05-01 11:11:06 Yes I wear a helmet because most people do not know how to drive. Oil is something we should have gotten rid of during the 70s crisis. But the industry lobbied governments to keep it going. Wrong decision. Today we are playing catch up.
6590 2018-05-01 11:10:58 Re heat pan then add water and scrub with sponge. Dry on stove then add tsp of veg oil and spread with paper towel.

6614 2018-05-01 11:07:43 The price of crude oil has been slowly increasing. Now $80 approx. So with the added regional tax an increasing number of people will decide to use PT, walk or bike.
And more new cycleways will accelerate the change away from cars.
6615 2018-05-01 11:07:37 Examples of how oil has improved our lives: affordable energy, goods and services, medical advances, prosthetic limbs, fertilizer for crops, technology......
6616 2018-05-01 11:07:22 Fix the oil prices that you've let get out of control due to idiotic trade war and threats to Iran. No one is duped by minuscule tax savings and cost of living increases since you took over. Worse president in the history. And filthy, vulgar human being. A national embarassment.
6617 2018-05-01 11:07:13 Isn’t the oil in a separate packet for a reason? You don’t have to add all of it

6622 2018-05-01 11:06:48 Yeah, they are using their "oil money" to subsidise and fund all sorts of renewable ventures. So when they stop, they will already have the infrastructure to survive without fossil fuels
6623 2018-05-01 11:06:46 だめー！
6624 2018-05-01 11:06:44 Question... When the United States invades a country for its oil and a million people die, are those deaths blamed on capitalism? What about all the deaths associated with inadequate healthcare in America? Capitalism or no?
6625 2018-05-01 11:06:44 All that means is less money income tax money for the oligarchy’s usury/oil wars!! Great!
6626 2018-05-01 11:06:27 Just heard that the Iranians are getting $100,000,000 (100 million) more PER DAY from oil sales, because Obama lifted the sanctions. Any guess where that money is going? Hint, it ain’t for peaceful purposes.
6627 2018-05-01 11:06:21 $cl_f down about 1% looks like oil won’t be a good play today.

6635 2018-05-01 11:04:46 Brilliant Idea! Tres bien! Start building caves for the new wave of immigrants. Much cheaper than houses and you can burn your neighbor's furniture in your cave, instead of oil.
6636 2018-05-01 11:04:38 It's an easy one, although here in Greece we have many types of phyllo you can buy that are made with olive oil
6637 2018-05-01 11:04:18 I doubt Bill Gates is interested in a financial pay-off. If he was, he's been doing it wrong. Compare with the Oil majors, the Breweries, etc and you can see the clear difference. The overall point is still valid though - America as a rule, doesn't do "free" stuff

6639 2018-05-01 11:04:12 Modi failed to deliver “achhe din” in spite of the oil bonanza during the first 4 years of his term. Now that the crude prices are back again to the 2014 levels, the Indian economy looks headed for a hard landing.

So much for Modi’s supposed mastery in managing the economy !!
6640 2018-05-01 11:04:05 Enough of publicity on the off shore oil conference abroad. Come back home to Nigeria and fix our refineries. I don't mean TAM because they are already bastardized.
6641 2018-05-01 11:03:54 @DineshDSouza is correct everything Obama did was to weaken America. What are the odds a % of the "pallet of untraceable cash" went to a secret account in Obama's & Jarrett's name. It was a ruse to raise sanctions, give Iran cash & a revenue stream thru oil sales to continue evil

6662 2018-05-01 11:01:31 That part of Dez Governorate, where the oil fields are located , really falls outside of general area considered Rojova- thus ( imo) , it’s not particularly meaningful to SDF/ YPG. But as mentioned , denying those oil fields to Assad is meaningful to the US.

6671 2018-05-01 11:00:49 Commercial oil exploration in Ilaje is the reason why Ondo state qualifies as an oil producing state.

Prattling I know but the hour of reckoning approaches
6801 2018-05-01 10:39:27 My answer to this theory: as long as Oil industry continues spending on R&D, more oil will discovered and more oil will be produced (increase discovery and recovery); hence end of Oil has no meaning as long as it has some use.
6802 2018-05-01 10:39:14 It's becoming an absolute joke. Aus dollar doing well oil prices low and fuel 200% profit up. Might as well piss in your tank

6805 2018-05-01 10:38:25 We also need to change oil quality in every month, i.e., soyabean oil to sun flower oil then to mustard oil then to Olive oil. Because everyone oil has different kind of essential fatty acids which is good for health.

6815 2018-05-01 10:36:48 That was the impression from a trip last week, yes. Multi-billion dollar refinery investments questioned if oil demand will peak in 10-15 years.

6817 2018-05-01 10:36:45 Oil production in Canada is going up, and I believe is at the highest amount in history. Yeah the oil industry rally is dying. Oil prices didn't go down because of Canadian politics.
6818 2018-05-01 10:36:33 Thank you God for a brand new morning that brings with it new mercies, new hope, new perspective, new possibilities, new opportunities, & prayerfully fresh oil.

6832 2018-05-01 10:34:36 We have a national energy program. It involves pipelines and catering to big oil, and to H** with climate and the environment.
6833 2018-05-01 10:34:20 I just wash my face and slap on some tea tree oil and it works better than most skincare routines that deal in clearing out pimples, that's the tea for today.
6834 2018-05-01 10:34:11 I would have thought gwenyth paltrow was too busy selling snake oil to morons to still act.
6835 2018-05-01 10:34:09 And all these wars started after their leaders stopped using the US dollar to sell oil... And guess what? Iran just did that too... How predictable these psychopaths are...
6836 2018-05-01 10:33:54 “For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil; but in the end she is bitter as gall,m... Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave. She gives no thought to the way of life; her paths wander aimlessly...”
Proverbs 5:3
6837 2018-05-01 10:33:47 Global warming will reduce the future need for coal, oil & gas so while its colder than normal surely burning coal today will save for tomorrow.

6846 2018-05-01 10:32:53 To call Venezuela socialist is hilariously ignorant.
71% of Venezuela’s gdp is privately owned and Venezuela’s economy only collapsed due to capitalist crisis in the oil market
6847 2018-05-01 10:32:43 Classic Bish stitch up: 
On the one hand you're saying there's no real impact on climate change if permits are lasting 30 years. 
On the other hand, you've been saying that jobs and the economy in Taranaki will not survive as a result of not pumping oil. 
Which is it?

7119 2018-05-01 09:42:04 The market operator has been saying this for several yrs: we are on the path to breaking the grid, and balancing inputs of VRE while losing spinning reserve is going to become critical very soon.

Giles Parkinson sells snake oil. Period.
7120 2018-05-01 09:42:00 Not off the top of my head, but as I remember it, oil demand was slowing seriously while key market players were still singing, the only way is up now....
7121 2018-05-01 09:41:54 Just jump straight in and ask them to explain the MGU-H and their thoughts on oil burning.
7122 2018-05-01 09:41:47 Progressive thinking.
Both Nigeria & Rwanda went through a civil war, we even got oil to our advantage but see where they are as a nation.

We are not ready in this country.

7132 2018-05-01 09:40:32 It is a worrysome trend that cash flow is in huge decline for all oil companies. In my view this is due to extreme fast depletion.
7133 2018-05-01 09:40:26 A good point to start might be labour income per sector. Very low in extraction of oil, natural gas. Interestingly, in Texas rent part of the rest of income goes to land owners and companies while it's a citizen's dividend in Alaska and government income in the Netherlands.

7163 2018-05-01 09:36:53 Cash flow is nevertheless extremely disappointing given the high oil price. Depletion is now a massive issue for all oil companies.

• Beat 2 eggs properly & mix in 4 tbsp of olive oil. 

• Apply this mixture to your hair & scalp then comb your hair with a wide toothed comb. 

• Wear a shower cap & leave it on for 30 to 45 minutes. 

• Rinse it off & wash your hair with a shampoo.

7266 2018-05-01 09:21:22 I'd say pan on medium heat - but think of it more as fried bread than toast. Not so healthy, but need some sort of oil for it to work well.  We flip ours once the base of the egg has set which helps get everything right.

7312 2018-05-01 09:12:00 Was in Norway recently and 54% of GDP is tax. I think 31% in Ireland. So it's not just their oil and gas (though that helps!)
7313 2018-05-01 09:11:56 The problem you had in 2013–14 with the White Paper was that SNP baked in hideously optimistic figures for oil revenue as a basis (yeah, they said it was a bonus) and it barely broke even; and they omitted so many other costs (or said they'd do it all for £200m).
7314 2018-05-01 09:11:38 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
7315 2018-05-01 09:11:30 Global oil prices decreased 50% when ur govt formed. No difference in oil prices in the country if we compare congress and bjp. Do you really think BJP doing good job???
7316 2018-05-01 09:11:29 Hi I’m waking too, I had brocoli, green beans, orange, spaghetti, and water for dinner last night, I chose olive oil. Than I had a shower. I’m feeling good now. How are you, feeling well, keeping hydrating. Always hoping @garysnowpatrol
7317 2018-05-01 09:11:11 +8.6% y/y in anything doesn't seem like "weakness" to me ... but what do I know? I keep wondering whether higher oil prices = "good for the consumer pocket" so clearly I'm the wrong person to discuss this!
7318 2018-05-01 09:11:08 Yes my kids have also enjoyed war related venues with live tank/ warfare enactments... Duxford was also another good visit particularly on air show days... unfortunately when it comes to oil paintings the resounding response was- boorriinng!

7332 2018-05-01 09:08:25 Cool. I worked in the ND oilfields for a few years and remember hearing how nasty the tar sands and Albertan oil was.
7333 2018-05-01 09:08:19 So USA will just burn all that oil, in the end be filthy, cancer ridden, depleted of resurces while rest of the world develops clean renewable energy technology? Sounds like helluva plan!

7544 2018-05-01 08:22:15 Yep. But the guys that at TFL or Incel just cant communicate. Look at the dude who did the toronto attack. He wasnt a bad looking bloke so it must ultimately come down to how he interacts with women. Like, im no oil painting but ive done alright when luck has been on my side.

7551 2018-05-01 08:20:15 And this was a company wringing it's hands and crying because the price of oil was dropping? Threatening to get rid of workers if the price of oil didn't go up.

7553 2018-05-01 08:19:05 To be honest there's not really a recipe that I use - I generally freestyle it with whatever I've got. This one was red onion, a couple of chillies, diced tomato, coriander, a little oil and some seasoning.

7677 2018-05-01 07:57:08 But the US is still importing oil so what stops us from asking? We could not even ask! We are producing but are we selling as much as we produce? So if Saraki is right and GEJ negotiated a poor deal, Buhari cannot negotiate a better deal?

7701 2018-05-01 07:50:38 Jist Last week, US exploration rose to 10.7 Mpd
The amunition deal is not a recent deal. It's the same deal Obama blocked. Same one that GEJ couldn't secure if we go by the submission of Saraki. Nigeria is still averaging about 2.2 MBp even with US shunning our oil.
7702 2018-05-01 07:50:38 Buhari could not tell America what to do about our crude oil but he is ready to do what America is telling him to do about her own Agricultural Products.

7705 2018-05-01 07:50:06 After spending nothing compared to the other top 6 clubs and having a temporary stadium, spurs will probably finish 3rd! There's a lot of people desperate for spurs to fail, because it flies in the face of media who laud over a coach and club solely reliant on oil money
7706 2018-05-01 07:49:57 Venezuela’s plight is sad to behold but is a cocktail of corruption, bad governance and US covert undermining. Conversely, at its best when it’s oil found global markets at a fair price, you saw swarms of well fed smiling school children running from decent homes to new schools.
7707 2018-05-01 07:49:33 Notice how the blue line dips below the red line whenever oil prices crash? The government is too dependent upon oil royalties. Which is Klein’s fault because he got rid of almost all other sources of government revenue.

7831 2018-05-01 07:24:01 @sunrisedailynow Please ask Issa Aremu what is his stand on  proliferation of Contract Staffs and Contract Staffing in the Oil and Gas industry along other sectors of the economy, it is purely exploitative.

7835 2018-05-01 07:23:31 Obama asked to "help" Nigeria fight Boko Haram, Badluck Jonathan refused. I'm simple terms, they wanted to arm the Nigerian military draw attention to the conflict in the North - Borno, Maiduguri etc, while ExxonMobil, Shell & others, help themselves to oil in the South.

7845 2018-05-01 07:21:19 Hmm something interesting that happened in Pathfinder tonight... My skeleton alchemist nat-oned a negotiations check to enter a fort. The soldiers responded with pouring hot oil. He then rolled down the hill the fort sat upon. Not because he was touched by the oil, just because.
7846 2018-05-01 07:21:10 He should. He absolutely should. Norway’s management of North Sea Oil revenues puts us to shame. The slump you worked through was not caused by Labour nor solved by Thatcher. It was caused by Nixon abandoning the Dollar parity and solved by the EEC and North Sea oil.

8390 2018-05-01 05:49:07 How is stopping exploration an abrupt change given that oil is in no way in short supply??
8391 2018-05-01 05:49:03 How would that cause skyrocketing gas and food prices? Syria accounted for less than 1% of world oil production even before the civil war.
8392 2018-05-01 05:48:54 Unfortunately #sonamohapatra belongs to that gang only. She stood with anti-hindu forces many time in past. Let oil fry itself and others smell the burning...
8393 2018-05-01 05:48:47 CRUDE OIL UPDATE::

Oil prices extended gains on Tuesday, supported by comments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he was sure U.S. President Donald Trump would do "the right thing" in reviewing Iran's nuclear deal with western powers.

8402 2018-05-01 05:46:21 From what I remember, bio oil would never absorb on my skin. Used it today for a face massage/grit removal cause I have a whole bunch and yup, still didn't absorb. Which is a good thing in this case. I washed it all off but I'm hoping it doesn't break me out

8412 2018-05-01 05:44:47 It isn’t sold to the US AT A 30% discount.  There is 25% less oil in an Alberta barrel bc it is DILUTED & when chemicals are removed they don’t have a barrel left. Besides it’s junk, not suitable for gas. 90% of bitumen goes to Wash state where it is refined as aviation  fuel.

8416 2018-05-01 05:43:50 @drex you nailed it... price gouging, refinery shutdown and taxes on taxes. 67$ a barrel vs 130$ a few years ago cost of producing isn't going up, and oil extraction tech & fuel efficiency has more than paced availability of light sweet crude.

Does he know that the population is ~60% of the population of America? Does he think on the economics of the nation, ranked sixth in oil production?

8443 2018-05-01 05:39:37 You are trying to justify the US stealing Syria’s oil?

8445 2018-05-01 05:39:30 The first oil people switch to when they’re trying to get healthy is usually olive oil, which is cool... but it doesn’t have a high smoking point. 
So when you heat that shit up in the pan... it loses its nutrients and defeats the whole purpose.
It’s no longer a healthy fat.
8446 2018-05-01 05:39:22 I so gotta take photos of myself with oil all over me
8447 2018-05-01 05:39:11 I'm no fan of the East West link but it would have at least been used whereas any oil or gas discovered should stay in the ground.

8457 2018-05-01 05:36:52 Big huge diesel trucks are big here. And some small cars but there was a scandal with them because the emission stats were faked. The trucks are popular on oil drilling sites and for people who want to tow large things.
8458 2018-05-01 05:36:32 The growth in 13-14 (1.86 to 2.09) is 12% as per the above numbers. The cagr of GDP growth under this government is 5.7%. Not satisfactory, given the tailwinds of global recovery and low oil prices.
8459 2018-05-01 05:36:25 Avacado oil is good for frying.
Coconut oil is good for dishes you need to sauté.

8479 2018-05-01 05:33:17 If B.C. blocks the oil, Alberta and Saskatchewan can expect to pay as much as $2.00/L so the only way to fight back is to turn off the oil to B.C. And from what I've seen, Rachel Notley doesn't bluff.

8482 2018-05-01 05:32:52 The notion that there's is a "free market" is more absurd.Vancouver is at the mercy of US gas suppliers,who now have 2 new scapegoats- BC gov't & enviros are the problem.

8508 2018-05-01 05:27:50 …By the way, the #BushFamily is also closely linked with the #SaudiRoyalFamily through international oil deals. Which is potentially another reason why we’ve backed the #Saudis in their own shadow war against #Iran in #Yemen, & other #PersianGulf countries.

8517 2018-05-01 05:26:56 Nobody wants war, but I also understand it's about who's controlling the oil around the world. I understand our government involvement. Again, what do you think is going to happen if Russia, or a Russian backed country gets control of the oil around the world?
8518 2018-05-01 05:26:53 RIDDLE ME THIS:
In the 1990's OIL prices were $70+/ a barrel of oil & gasoline prices were under $2.00/gal

Today at roughly the same price /barrel & gasoline is at $3.50/gal in California

8529 2018-05-01 05:25:38 When trees are cut for crops or to build roads for tarsands extraction it divides the forest and the ground dries out making it more suseptible to fire. Actually it will go hand in hand. Stop oil further oil exploration and that will cut down on deforestation. Do we need more

I just read where the EPA crook Scott Pruitt granted BILLIONAIRE Carl Ichan a hardship waiver for his oil refinery worth $10s of billions for exemption of biofuels. Same Ichan that was working as WH advisor and investor. No conflicts???

IDK if you were around back then, but McDonald's French fries were *amazing*, but then the AMA/FDA/... decided for ALL OF US that vegetable oil must be "HEART-HEALTHY" and we must all eat fries made with *vegetable oil*!

And they literally stunk.

8546 2018-05-01 05:21:53 This is completely outrageous! Since when is an oil company need a hardship waiver? I certainly hope that it’s CEO, CFO, and the board of billionaires are required to forfeit their salaries and bonuses before qualifying for this waiver! Yeah, I didn’t think so.
8547 2018-05-01 05:21:48 U don't understand oil business .
US don't consum all the oil thy buy,the US refine oil for re-export.

8548 2018-05-01 05:21:37 It represents calendar year. So mid of 2014 to mid of 2018 is more than 30%. Bigger point, if its no new jobs it means super increase in productivity.Part of it is due to lower oil Prices & lower inflation.Others have to be due to increase in consumption.Means higher income.

8572 2018-05-01 05:16:12 It’s really hardddd but basically just out soap on it let it like break up the oil and then use like a soft bristle brush to like work it out and then rinse it out but it could just end up ruining the shoe entirely it’s rocket science
8573 2018-05-01 05:16:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but revisit them.
8574 2018-05-01 05:16:06 True. The whole Iraq war was about oil, but public support was because they wanted to save Muslims from murderous dictatorship. They didn't understand that Muslims like it that away. Why else would they naturally cling to a religion whose prophet was a harsh dictator?
8575 2018-05-01 05:16:05 I agree, Padre.  Much obliged.

8577 2018-05-01 05:15:48 However, one bright note is that Mexican and Venezuelan heavy oil going to Gulf refineries is in decline. Venezuela is shipping directly to China in payment of debt and Mexican production is in decline. So, our oil does enjoy Gulf refining market demand.
8578 2018-05-01 05:15:28 I’m guessing they’ll keep doing what they’re doing now, exporting manufactured goods and machinery. Although oil and gas is part of their export, it’s not the biggest nor the most important export.

Those bases in their Holy Homeland angered the #ArabMujahideen we sent to #Afghanistan.
8603 2018-05-01 05:10:59 There's time. In case the business cycle has peaked and starts moving south driving oil prices down, lower oil prices will boost refineries' profits in the short run. At the end, the reduction in final product's prices and its effects in CPI lag the business cycle. Don't they?...

8656 2018-05-01 04:59:24 For what? Taking picture with one of the greatest enemy of Nigeria
8657 2018-05-01 04:59:04 Noticed every other fanbase talking more and more shite? Its simple its because they know we are about to shut this shit down and they all hate it. We were royalty before the oil cash and royalty before the prem and we are 90 minutes away from champions league final. #Upthereds
8658 2018-05-01 04:58:57 Speaking as a child of Italian immigrants it is literally acceptable to just sprinkle on some olive oil, needs nothing else
8659 2018-05-01 04:58:36 Watching The Americans, where they give Page the Olive Oil to avoid getting drunk. Immediately thought "Does that work? For Science we should test it out"
8660 2018-05-01 04:58:26 It was oil, oil pastel, and color pencil on paper
8661 2018-05-01 04:58:09 Many years ago, I went to an "Italian" restaurant
that called itself "Gino's". I asked for olive oil on 
my salad and they said they didn't have any !
WTF ? They nullified my bill when I complained.
8662 2018-05-01 04:57:52 According to everybody, oil/gas still recovering from the recent slump, but OTC & Houston area seem to be booming. Diversification of economy? Many companies also working in subsea power (e.g. offshore wind energy), high tech (autonomous & smart systems), internet of things.

8664 2018-05-01 04:56:30 Why use any currency at all. Why not some form of barter system, like oil for machinery, oil for steel, oil for textiles or oil for food.
8665 2018-05-01 04:56:27 Actually no, they've never ever stated "will never be". That's a fandom manifestation. Jensen exploded under anti pressure a while ago that it didn't. Since then he was excited about a western romcom with Misha (spoilered for Tombstone) and Destiel oil rig fanfiction. (c)

Well done
8670 2018-05-01 04:54:56 hi if u wear henna or bindis pls make sure u have never made fun of anyone for putting oil on their hair before or called the bindi “ugly” before it became so-called  coachella/music festival fashion
8671 2018-05-01 04:54:39 haha jiffy lube what a funny name for a oil changing place
8672 2018-05-01 04:54:32 We need to save lives and trillions of dollars by stoping war for oil! We must raise oil taxes to $1 per gallon and use the new tax funds to offer rebates to new EV purchases.

8688 2018-05-01 04:51:57 Well. Only a small portion of oil shipped through BC ports. Not like the US that is shipping tanker, after,Tanker,after Tanker, after Tanker, after Tanker through the same waters (without Tug boats). How much does Alberta get from BC and Quebec in Transfer Payments????

8691 2018-05-01 04:51:24 thanks to the closeness of Trump et family with the Saudi's, this country is being run by crooks and thieves. The oil supply on the world's market is at highest level while usage is declining. Wonder how much stock the Trump family has invested in oil? If we saw his taxes we'd no

8694 2018-05-01 04:50:43 Fleury is starting to leak oil too, however I don't know if that last one was all his fault.  Team has to step-up.

8701 2018-05-01 04:49:47 The majority of C02 emitted from burning a single tonne of #coal or #oil today will be absorbed over a few centuries by the oceans and vegetation, the remaining 25% will still be affecting the climate in 1,000 years.

8710 2018-05-01 04:48:16 For scars tak sure, tapi i used Palmers oil to prevent stretch marks. Hasilnya, dah 2 anak memang takde stretch mark haha. 

Utk moisturize dry skin/eczema, memang tak okay. Too thin for me. Kena pakai lotion/creams. I have very bad eczema btw.

And it smells good too 
8711 2018-05-01 04:47:36 Kinder Morgan plans to pay for the TransMountain expansion by increasing the tolls it charges oil companies to ship bitumen in its existing pipeline from $2.20 per barrel to $5.64. Guten said the permanent increase would only lead to higher prices at the pumps.

8719 2018-05-01 04:46:07 Chemical exfoliation is what glycolic and lactic acid do. They’re alpha hydroxy acids(AHAs) and they help things like even skin done, smooth texture. The oil helps scarring too and alpha arbutin also helps scarring. The ordinary has detailed explanations on their website.
8720 2018-05-01 04:46:07 We are so screwed. Trump’s EPA just granted a “Hardship Waiver” to Big Oil billionaire Karl Icahn on basis of Financial Hardship. Unbelievable.

He never said what you say he said. Hi Ezra!
I remember how worried you were (or said you were) when oil prices dropped.
8743 2018-05-01 04:42:52 It’s not about how many junior it’s about getting produce to tidewater so that CNDs are getting fair price for the product. I guess you support blood oil from the human rights kings the Saudis which is importing daily

8757 2018-05-01 04:41:04 Venezuelan oil production could fall by 500,000 bpd this year, analysts believe, boosting global oil prices further.

8772 2018-05-01 04:38:31 You do realize it’s a multi purpose pipeline, just like the existing? It can ship any type of oil/fuel product and by twinning it means more of what we need while expanding crude oil sales right?
8773 2018-05-01 04:38:28 Dont know the percentages, but absolutely there's assholes out there faking the funk. So many POGs that had an arty shell drop in their general direction once, collecting 20% for life from the VA.

8786 2018-05-01 04:36:32 The decline in the prospects of the world’s largest oil reserves looks set to continue. Venezuelan oil production could fall by another 500,000 bpd this year, analysts believe, boosting global oil prices further.
8787 2018-05-01 04:36:31 This loss can be compensated for both Gov and People if they don't need to burn oil in traffic jams and signals. Gov should focus on finding the solution for that.
8788 2018-05-01 04:36:28 You're assuming there's a difference between both political parties.

What ideologies separate them?  They're both the same, bereft of any.

They're also run by political merchants who just want to enrich themselves from the centrally looted ND oil resources

So what’s to change?
8789 2018-05-01 04:36:17 Can we just kick him out and settle the dispute?
8790 2018-05-01 04:36:09 Plantains in coconut oil. Treat yo self.

8793 2018-05-01 04:35:47 Home heating will cost more, everything purchased in a store gets there by truck, plastics are oill based, this tax will cost everyone even if ppl use less. We still have to eat and not freeze. Device you tweeted on is oil based and trucked to a store.
8794 2018-05-01 04:35:47 You don’t think it’s right, fair and justified to have a GUARANTEE in regards to who is going to have to clean up an oil spill??  Don’t you think Kinder Morgan should put that $ in a holdings up front!???!!

8799 2018-05-01 04:34:54 i'd say no, thats only cause I used coconut oil cause of some twitter advice and nearly fucked my shit up. heard oil not even supposed to touch your face
8800 2018-05-01 04:34:45 Okay let's bring out the votes. 
Which of the oil is best for cooking
8801 2018-05-01 04:34:43 earlier today babe helped me moisturize with my lavender oil. it was quite fun
8802 2018-05-01 04:34:38 Coconut oil pon me bottom foot dem and socks to go to bed
8803 2018-05-01 04:34:30 อ่านแล้ว เกี่ยวกับฝันเห็นคนคนเดิมซ้ำๆประมาณนี้
8804 2018-05-01 04:34:27 Lately I been loving me some garlic. I would just cook a few cloves with olive oil and eat it straight up 
8805 2018-05-01 04:34:24 I think the scenario will go like this: the US will bomb Iran by August; Iran will retaliate by hitting the Gulf states; the Gulf states will enter the war and the destruction of the persian gulf states will began. Too much wealth accumulated in these countries from oil
8806 2018-05-01 04:34:03 took that long nap so imma be up all night and still gotta rinse this conditioner and oil out before my 9:30 
8807 2018-05-01 04:34:03 Competition between female teacher. We're on their ears r L-shaped. But we want to the original oil. Use brushes to understand that, my all
8808 2018-05-01 04:34:01 I want an oil cleanser and I need a toner
8809 2018-05-01 04:33:53 The Canadian economy loses somewhere between 35 to 50 billion dollars a year because we sell 3 million barrels of oil a day to USA at a rude discount and  we import 1 million barrels of oil a day at foreign premiums.  Fixing that would fund a faster move to a 'clean' economy
8810 2018-05-01 04:33:35 2 tablespoons of raw white sugar
Tablespoon of honey 
Teaspoon of lemon juice 
Teaspoon of parsley (dry or fresh is optional, I use fresh/finely chopped parsley)
Tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil
It's supposed to be very thick and coarse :) let it absorb before washing off
8811 2018-05-01 04:33:16 I've noticed a lot of your shoppers who decide not to buy something in their cart will drop it off on a random shelf anywhere in the store.  Lazy people, also a copious amount of oil spots all over a new parking lot @ a store near me.  Lazy car owners too.
8812 2018-05-01 04:33:13 Hehe...America will now owned all the oil fields.
8813 2018-05-01 04:33:03 ในทวิตบอกดี เลยซื้อมาได้เเค่ตัวกล่องขาวมาอีกตัวหาไม่เจอ
8814 2018-05-01 04:32:44 Its kinoo area near the side of national oil. Its near a building that has network mast of the sides.
8815 2018-05-01 04:32:42 What would he do different if obama was actually working with our enemy? He gave cash to iran, cut our military greatly, unilaterally cut nukes, limited where we could drill for oil, trird to kill coal, had a war on power plants,  people do not realize how much damage he did.
8816 2018-05-01 04:32:40 And while they’re slavishly focused on one direction, they’re not paying attention to the oil slicks and pot holes and blown tires, all the important little things that could make the difference on reaching that destination or not.
8817 2018-05-01 04:32:14 I been in the pipeline biz since I was 17. It's come a long way. People are so clueless about the hoops you have to jump through everyday in the name of safety and environmental protection. So frustrating dealing with clueless fucks that think oil=filth
8818 2018-05-01 04:32:12 ใช้ดีหรอ
8819 2018-05-01 04:32:11 Idk why people hate the smell of tea tree oil. I love it

8828 2018-05-01 04:31:00 We haven’t had offshore drilling in WA for over 50 years, and we can’t let that change now. It’ll take all of us standing together and making our voices heard to stop the Trump Administration’s damaging decision to auction off Washington state’s coasts to oil companies.
8829 2018-05-01 04:30:56 The only reasons it isn’t legal, & widely used are based entirely on Big Pharma now. Early on, Big Oil was involved too. Marijuana is not only therapeutic, it’s also a good fuel source. And there are now signs of it helping Alzheimer’s disease/dementia. Safer than opioids 4 pain

8834 2018-05-01 04:30:26 Yes. But give her edibles instead.
I use oil on my hands for arthritis. Works well.
Edibles for sleep and calming my copd air hunger anxiety.
8835 2018-05-01 04:30:14 Alphabet/Google/IPO! My suggestion: Stay in Oil/Tourism Business! H-Care Must be Ethical.
8836 2018-05-01 04:30:03 Yes but anything with batteries and solar still requires mining and oil. And some of the cobalt mining for batteries is happening in Africa with children as young as seven working in deplorable conditions. We still need oil until other acceptable options are available
8837 2018-05-01 04:30:01 Stop subsidizing oil and build more fast charge ev stations and match Ontario’s ev rebate.  Look at the rest of the world.  They are all moving to ev cars and fast charge stations.  If we want to be competitive not just now but 10-15 years from now, oil isn’t the answer.

8846 2018-05-01 04:27:11 I just started using Jamaican castor oil
8847 2018-05-01 04:27:10 Will your Congress government give petrol and diesel at Rs 40 and Rs 30 respectively, if global crude oil price continues at this rate. Will you think about the war bw people and govt. at that time u rule?

8849 2018-05-01 04:26:48 Generated by oil and grain shipped via B.C. ports?
8850 2018-05-01 04:26:44 Rosneft's main Venezuelan asset is a 40% stake in the PetroMonagas heavy oil modernization project of 140,000 b / d. The CNPC, has 40% in the company of Sinovensa crude mixtures of 130,000 b / d. PDVSA has 60% interest in both projects.
8851 2018-05-01 04:26:19 The answer is no. I'm pretty sure Trudeau invented oil diffusers to alienate Christians and Patriots.
8852 2018-05-01 04:26:00 Trump completely "Brain washed" and intimidated Buhari so much so that Buhari couldn't remeber to asl him to increase the USA purchase of our crude oil.
8853 2018-05-01 04:25:59 Will your Congress government give petrol and diesel at Rs 40 and Rs 30 respectively, if global crude oil price continues at this rate. Will you think about the war bw people and govt. at that time u rule?

Regression of cirrhosis, not bad.
8862 2018-05-01 04:25:11 Castor oil!
8863 2018-05-01 04:25:07 You make a great point! We are exporting OIL which is supposed to be a pollutant to OTHER countries to POLLUTE on their side of the globe but not ours...  make sense?  Sure, take our oil to use in your GAS/DEISEL vehicles to contribute to climate change because we don’t want it?
8864 2018-05-01 04:25:03 Madam Andleeb you are prominent leader of PTI. Try to understand that Pakistan imports oil. If international oil prices go up, our prices will be up. These days oil has touched $70/barrel. It used to be between $45-50/per barrel. Please visit any business newspaper.

I'm super glad that it's helpful to you! Thankfully, CBD oil helps me with pain, but I think I must be really incompatible with THC. Le sigh.
8871 2018-05-01 04:22:48 People have been conditioned to believe oil and gas is the only way. Or guilted into believing it’s their fault they use oil and gas. It’s a monopoly. Our governments are bought. End subsidies and alternatives will flourish.
8872 2018-05-01 04:22:44 I bet Putin loves all those sanctions crippling his economy, the $100’s of billions rebuilding our military, exporting of US oil and gas, and the bombing of his pet monster, Assad. Wait... why did he want Trump?
8873 2018-05-01 04:22:32 Gahhh it’s genetic...so for the rest of us peasants - baking soda and coconut oil yathink?
8874 2018-05-01 04:22:07 Yeah let’s just waste a ton of money to boost your ego because some country disliked us for killing their loved ones for oil and money.
8875 2018-05-01 04:22:03 Three interesting alternatives I have recently read about: Rerum, baking soda (basic pH), and Rick Simpson oil (not sure about legality). Praying for a quick healing for you 
8876 2018-05-01 04:21:47 I saw on @chrissyteigen ‘s insta story that she uses normal people cooking oil and for some reason it really encouraged me that my life is great and I’m doing great and we’re all great here
8877 2018-05-01 04:21:12 And my state, TN, is getting oil drilling and tunnel drilling projects :( .. what fairness?!
8878 2018-05-01 04:21:03 They are starting to "liberalize" because their oil wells are not as profitable as they use to be.
8879 2018-05-01 04:20:42 If you EVER get a c-section or any type of abdominal surgery take a tablespoon of mineral oil every day until you poop. TRUST ME ON THIS ONE.

8881 2018-05-01 04:19:43 [AMuS] Next Mercedes suspicion: Ferrari mix hydraulic oil through supply lines in the cylinder. The FIA examined the hydraulic circle of the Ferrari in China and got drawings of the entire oil system. With the result: Everything is legal.

8882 2018-05-01 04:19:35 If @ElizabethMay & @kennedystewart were sincere, they 'd have first led protests of oil by rail. Instead they are seeking the spot light by challenging court orders to protest #TransMountain, hoping for kid gloves treatment by the courts. Cowards & self promoting #cdnpoli shills.

Better to have Sharia for the nation now than Iranian control of a large amount of the worlds oil I suppose?
8887 2018-05-01 04:18:19 this is a tweet about the power of oil and vinegar
8888 2018-05-01 04:18:19 [AMuS] Mercedes went to the FIA and accused Ferrari of:

1) still using oil in the combustion process to increase performance, and being above the new oil rule.
Several investigations by the FIA went nowhere. Ferrari remained in all races below the limit.

Mercedes failed

8889 2018-05-01 04:18:11 Oil prices extended gains on Tuesday, supported by comments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he was sure U.S. President Donald Trump would do "the right thing" in reviewing Iran's nuclear deal with western powers.
8890 2018-05-01 04:17:58 Now just wait for an oil embargo imposed on Iran then watch crude oil and thus gas prices go up even more. Gotta do the embargo I know but we still pay the price from our pockets. Jim

8906 2018-05-01 04:15:41 Excellent point well made, but then Giuliani has always been a hack, a shill, and a carnival side show barker! “Snake oil, get your orange snake oil here”!
8907 2018-05-01 04:15:26 Gas in my area has gone up about 50 cents in pass week, there goes our little tax cut to OPEC, Saudi Arabia want the price of a barrel of oil back up to 80 to 100 dollar. We been rip off for years
8908 2018-05-01 04:15:20 Not really. Some time ago Dr. Weaver tweeted he did not use oil in his daily life because he drives an EV.          Dead silence, eh?

8914 2018-05-01 04:14:30 There will be a two state solution and our pipeline will take Iranian and Syrian oil right through one of the states to the Sea! We will be the largest oil supplier in the world. I heard you.

8916 2018-05-01 04:14:19 Given that you don't even know what a makeshift oil refinery looks like, take this footage to the nearest native Arabic speaker and let them translate what's being said.
Shame though coz the closest thing that looks remotely Arab where u r is the stale flatbread in ur local 7/11.
8917 2018-05-01 04:14:17 No future plan for transitioning, low royalties, just selling labour and oil until it dries up and the multinationals move on with Canada left to clean up the mess one day.

8919 2018-05-01 04:14:04 @BarackObama Hey Barack wanted to thank you for the brutal Iranian deal nothing like sending them planes full of cash and ability to sell 1 million barrels/day of oil at $72 USD. As brilliant as calling ISIS a JV league organization. You were a hell of a speech giver Nothing else
8920 2018-05-01 04:14:03 Good job. If pipe gas is liquefied for fuel, it is also a big GHG source, and if in a carbon levied locale, prob adds more  to fuel than GHG costs passed on by refiners. Also, if economical, refiners can hydrotreat fuel oil/diesel to lower sulphur, improving LSFO/gasoil blending.
8921 2018-05-01 04:13:43 Dollar Recovery May Also Claim Gold and Oil as Victims
A strong Dollar has put serious pressure on EUR/USD, GBP/USD and USD/JPY reversals. This same recovery effort can exact its influence on the commodity world where the relationship to USD is acute...
8922 2018-05-01 04:13:32 But guy you really should be ashamed of this. Are you discrediting facts?  
Okay granted that he was can you outline a single thing Buhari achieved. Do I need to remind you that it took a single tweet by Trump to shift the oil prices to our detriment ?
8923 2018-05-01 04:13:32 be a big step. But just think about this for a minute from another nations point of view. Iran's for instance. They had a democracy, nationalized oil, had a western based coup, a dictator installed, a brutal religious  regime to, & now surrounded by US troops...what would you do?

8935 2018-05-01 04:12:19 They all have one thing in common. As I said, it's high time we move away from oil. It's bound to happen sooner rather than later, we need to be prepared for that to happen.

8944 2018-05-01 04:10:43 What about the 350,000 jobs lost in the oil patch and related industries? And how many of those 600,000 jobs you created are public sector, paid by tax dollars? How many are full-time? You stats are highly misleading.

Canada has lost 350,000 jobs in the oil and gas sector, but I'm supposed to applaud when Trudeau brings in 3,000 warehouse jobs?! This is just getting ridiculous.

8947 2018-05-01 04:10:39 It's not like they're an oil company or something. They got rich off making people happy so it's hard to be too upset about that.

8953 2018-05-01 04:10:03 You do realize that there was much more of a reason to actually go to war in Iraq than oil markets?  If you're treating that military action as being a function of an economic system on par with The Great Leap and Stalins purges in the Ukraine and beyond, you're hopeless.
8954 2018-05-01 04:09:52 I want to ask a simpler question. Why is any uncertainty in Climate Science a point of contentino at all? Pollution is a known health risk. Water table contamination from fracking, oil spills land & sea, soil depletion from petroleum based fertilizers, on & on. 

Why minutia?

8961 2018-05-01 04:08:32 First off, guns are not synonymous with hate. Secondly, the only way to extinguish an oil well fire is with explosives. Using a gun to stop a bad guy, with or without a gun, is the most effective way to ensure your survival AND HIS.

9017 2018-05-01 03:59:30 @realDonaldTrump you need to tell oil  Companies if they don't keep gas prices low you will  Collect additional profit as tax.  You want the people of America to be more happy keep gas prices low.  It's crap that as soon as  Nice weather comes gaskho's from $2.25 to $3 a gallon!

9059 2018-05-01 03:51:55 I know this sounds super hippy-dippy but I make my own. Cheap as heck & works better than any other stuff I've tried. 1 T baking soda, 1 T cornstarch, 1.5 T coconut oil, 1.5 T shea butter, 5 drops lavender oil+few drops other oils I like for scent
9060 2018-05-01 03:51:48 just use coconut oil
9061 2018-05-01 03:51:43 I once played in a ruptured oil pipeline. Oil and oil mud. Drove my mother insane. 
9062 2018-05-01 03:51:41 Wow is that what my life really means...[sighs. Returns to heating pad and lavender oil solitude.]
9063 2018-05-01 03:51:36 Try cbd oil, a couple drops under the tongue for faster effects
9064 2018-05-01 03:51:32 おめでとうございます！
9065 2018-05-01 03:51:22 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
9066 2018-05-01 03:51:20 Happy birthday My sister
9067 2018-05-01 03:50:41 #SustainableEnergy is the future. The sooner we stop extracting, burning  #fossilfuels (coal, oil, natural gas), the better for us all. All vehicles must be fully electric, powered by sustainable energy ASAP. #EV
9068 2018-05-01 03:50:28 No sé nada de perforación pero los que sí saben así lo comentan, el pozo Sama 1 en Tabasco está a 166 metros de profundidad (aguas someras o poco profundas) con sus más de mil millones de barriles d petróleo pertenece a Inglaterra, EUA y la sierra oil & gas de México (C. Salinas)
9069 2018-05-01 03:50:10 Carriers vary. Glycerin is sweet. Fractionated Coconut oil is common too and my preference. Check the percentage of pure cbd isolate. Cheaper usually means very diluted.
9070 2018-05-01 03:50:06 I want a big ass mother fucking Italian sub. lite mayo, lettuce tomato onion, provolone, pepperoni and capicola, oil and vinegar. #hungry
9071 2018-05-01 03:50:02 Oil companies are gouging Canadians and the governments are are ripping off Canadians with massive taxes! I buy gas across the border for $1.00 liter!!! Pick up dairy, chicken, eggs, etc at half the Canadian price!
9072 2018-05-01 03:49:51 My sentiments entirely when the oil patch boomed Alberta did not take enough royalties from the conglomerates which were making billions in oil revenue which should have paid for the infrastructure as well future investment into renewable energy after the patch left!
9073 2018-05-01 03:49:29 My timeline needs Jesus and a dab of oil lol
9074 2018-05-01 03:49:19 oh!イル

9076 2018-05-01 03:49:14 i’ve been using coconut oil for a week so it’s safe to say that my boho-vegan-crossfit-diy-lifestyle-fashion-pastel-anus blog will be coming out sometime next month
9077 2018-05-01 03:48:32 Of course, the oil companies are gouging Canadians and the governments are are ripping off Canadians with massive taxes! I buy gas across the border for $1.00 liter!!! Pick up dairy, chicken, eggs, etc at half the Canadian price!
9078 2018-05-01 03:48:24 なぜだか足が重いですが、僕はそろそろ今日のお仕事終わりです！！！
9079 2018-05-01 03:48:22 I got a 10:30 appt at Bondy’s to get my oil changed nshit on the Charger. I done put so many miles on that bitch in the last month  esp after this weekend taking it down to Orlando
9080 2018-05-01 03:48:20 Random ass recipe for y'all:
-Two fillets of salmon seasoned with garlic, salt, lemon, and parsley, and sesame oil

Place the fish on a crimped foil and bake for 20 minutes. Enjoy with half a cup of brown rice.
9081 2018-05-01 03:48:18 Ha ha Dan, you complete fool. British Columbia gets much of it's oil from Venezuela which you described as a banana republic to a tee. Sad you don't even know how the province powers it's vehicles. 

Apparently not classy, I I take it back.
9082 2018-05-01 03:48:06 Yeah get a diffuser with essential oils or melt some coconut oil and put peppermint or lavender oil in it then rub some on your temples, it dilutes the oil cuz I don't think straight oil on the skin is good for it
9083 2018-05-01 03:47:43 #كلمه_جميله_تطيب_الخاطر 
محتاجه اسمعها هالأيام مهو اقولها؟
9084 2018-05-01 03:47:41 I live in Canada, up until 3-4 years ago up here welders had the potential to earn a very comfortable living depending on which province you were located... For the most part, our industry in Canada is tied to oil, which has been doing quite poorly, so work is hard to find now.
9085 2018-05-01 03:47:40 Why aren't car companies lobbying against #Trudeau ? What about oil & gas companies? He's attacking their livelihood. When will the businesses that make #Canada run start advocating for themselves?

9088 2018-05-01 03:46:42 uh huh...snake oil slingin' 'minister'
9089 2018-05-01 03:46:38 Perhaps for a while, but we aren't the smart option for Asia to buy from. They can get far more oil for a fraction of the transport costs from the LOOP. We've missed the boat, that or we'll have to give Asia a discount too. There are much better uses of our resources.
9090 2018-05-01 03:46:24 Cornier than @Javedakhtarjadu but at least it depicts the truth. Someone ought to have the medicinal magic oil Jadu endorses tested for the claims & sue both if an impropriety is discovered.
9091 2018-05-01 03:46:08 I am so happy that America and its allies fought fire with fire in WII. If hitler can murder millions of his fellow Europeans I wonder what he would have done with tens of millions of defenseless black Africans living in temperate oil field arable land.
9092 2018-05-01 03:46:04 Going on vacation in june. Dont know if i should bring flower edibles or oil
9093 2018-05-01 03:45:53 Only in #Algeria: a Kyasse asks the CEO of the largest oil company in Africa about the status of the corporate negotiations with ExxonMobil about potential future development projects
9094 2018-05-01 03:45:46 He actually primarily works for tge green party, without their collision he would be the opposition. Im sure foreign oil contributes as well 
9095 2018-05-01 03:45:34 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
9096 2018-05-01 03:45:30 @Joshua7Cortez bruh oil companies are going on a hiring frenzy too much work to keep up! I smell another boom :) bakken here i come :)

9098 2018-05-01 03:45:25 I’ve put body oil on four times today and my shins are still dry. WHY 
9099 2018-05-01 03:45:15 so true but more broadly those pod save america boys can sell oil to a sheik
9100 2018-05-01 03:45:11 While he uses a oil tanker to fill up his giant luxury boat. Ya.
9101 2018-05-01 03:44:55 I just checked the gasoline prices in the DFW area today online as the prices in YYC are so high, the Costco lines are reminiscent of that time in the 70's price spike... Anyhow, it's 80 cents/litre CAD today in Dallas. Thanks to all that cheap oil Canada "sells" to the US...
9102 2018-05-01 03:44:51 You right you right. Just don’t let me expose you for the oil blotting sheets

Ain't no nigga doing this.
9107 2018-05-01 03:44:09 Burning sage and having my oil diffuser going literally keeps me sane. It soothes me.
9108 2018-05-01 03:43:56 It's actually Gov'ts fault because oil companies can't, and can't be expected to, manage regional boundaries.
The easiest way to deal with the rise is to spread the cost nationwide.
The Gov't just doesn't understand this, and it's going to be a major problem.
9109 2018-05-01 03:43:50 I count 99 cars each holding 707 barrels of oil, that's 69,993 barrels on that train. Trans mountain would ship 707,500 barrels a day. They need to run 10 of these trains per day to match the output. What are the chances of an accident or derailment of one of those 990 rail cars.
9110 2018-05-01 03:43:50 I was supposed to change my oil today,  put air in my tired and so much more

9117 2018-05-01 03:42:45 Great news! The lower mainland will now need even more fuel and oil products 1) to get materials to the building for the renovation 2) to receive and then distribute all the thousands of items that Amazon sells. #BC needs #AB #oil #buildkm #Hypocrisy

9127 2018-05-01 03:41:05 We export Alberta oil, which is sold at a steep discount because the quality is low, then we import higher quality higher priced crude and refined products that are far more expensive. It's a net loss for us compared to refining our own oil at home.
9128 2018-05-01 03:40:57 Honestly please, PLEASE, research the natural remedies and double dose on those.

Alkaline Water, Turmeric, Cannabis oil to name just a few, eat raw veg and fruit, cut out all processed foods etc.

9130 2018-05-01 03:40:33 In February, Abu Dhabi’s state energy company ADNOC said it had awarded Japan’s INPEX a 10 percent stake in Lower Zakum offshore oil concession, in a 40-year deal worth $600 million.

9135 2018-05-01 03:40:15 The oil will still travel by rail.  Lots & lots of trains.  Which is a lot more emissions than a pipeline.  America will still buy our oil because we give them such a great deal.  America really isn’t our competition in foreign markets as we can’t get our oil there.

9145 2018-05-01 03:39:16 Thing I didn’t know growing up in the soybean capital of the US: soybean oil is not great for you. It’s high in Omega-6, and can cause inflammation. Same goes for vegetable and canola oils.
9146 2018-05-01 03:39:08 Ok let’s suppose for a second that somehow, global warming is a myth. What would our energy consumption look like today? What would it look like in 50 years when the earth is running low on fossil-fuels? Would the environmental risks of drilling oil and burning coal be enough2

9148 2018-05-01 03:38:39 Be careful where you get your cbd. Hempseed oil and extracts are not a source—though is an excellent anti inflammatory. Majority of legal cbd extracted with harsh chemicals from industrial hemp leftovers. Research your source carefully. Safety, quality and potency vary widely.

9161 2018-05-01 03:36:37 Stopping a pipeline does not reduce emissions. Oil consumption will continue supplied by countries that receive market value for their oil.
9162 2018-05-01 03:36:33 Isn’t exporting and importing better for our economy than just importing.    Ideally we would only export oil.

9183 2018-05-01 03:33:30 The US buys 90% of it's oil domestically. Canada is the US largest trading partner for oil imports. Only 3 countries in the middle east made the top 10 list of US oil trade deficit.

9190 2018-05-01 03:32:18 "Secretary Pompeo" What's NOT surprising that Iran *might* have had a secret nuclear weapons program? Two things: First, their most worrisome opponents - Israel and the USA - both have nuclear weapons. And second, Iran never needed nuclear power anyway. They have oil & sunshine.
9191 2018-05-01 03:32:14 Epsom salts in a bath can help! Also, filling a long sock with uncooked rice, tying the end, and heating it up in the microwave will make a simple hot pad to rest over the aching muscles! You can add lavender oil to the rice, but i prefer a lavender spritz

9194 2018-05-01 03:31:55 20 for a discussion on oil production….
9195 2018-05-01 03:30:53 The Canadian economy loses somewhere between 35 and 50 billion dollars a year because we sell 3 million barrels of oil a day at a rude discount and because we import 1 million barrels of oil a day at foreign premiums. Fix that!
9196 2018-05-01 03:30:47 Last time I checked, fire was exactly what they use to fight oil well fires. Just saying.

9199 2018-05-01 03:30:11 At the expense of the fishery and environment. Seismic testing is killing our ocean but hey - big oil.  What could possibly go wrong?
9200 2018-05-01 03:30:09 Had the same Meany years ago, a Nurse said take one Fish Oil Capsule a day may help, it worked for me, however it could of been a coincidence with it stopping, but got to be worth a try as the oil is good for your joints anyway. Hope it Helps  MT.
9201 2018-05-01 03:29:57 Alberta's economy is not just oil & gas. There's also major hubs for healthcare, IT, agriculture, bio-industrial, and renewables.
9202 2018-05-01 03:29:36 I like the renewable energy idea better, better for the environment and of course creates much more secure jobs. Jobs in oil and gas sector are highly susceptible to violotality of the market.
9203 2018-05-01 03:29:05 @ChelseaCooper07 take over the oil make it a government resource and sell the gas under 5 cents a litre.
9204 2018-05-01 03:28:58 If we could harness it all, we could probably replace oil overnight.

9206 2018-05-01 03:28:43 My mom told me not to cover myself in tanning oil and I said "it's fine I just tan" and after just a day I have a painful ass burn but I'm playing it off like it's nothing because I DO NOT want to hear "told u so"..I'm suffering in silence atm SOS

9208 2018-05-01 03:28:35 I suppose the oil companies and their prices are, but that’s just me trying to add things together without doing a whole bunch of research. I’m usually right but I’m not always right. If you’re curious and want exact answers it’s best to ask google and read a bit
9209 2018-05-01 03:28:32 because I’m afraid that the hot oil will keep splattering on me or the egg will explode lmaoo
9210 2018-05-01 03:28:21 Wear hours jobs. Nice going.   How about the high paying oil sand jobs. Oh yeah Soros won't let butts do it, butts won't let Trudeau do it.
9211 2018-05-01 03:28:17 Sorry....CBD oil...good stuff!
9212 2018-05-01 03:28:14 Did someone from an oil company or automaker pay for this article? I do appreciate that they atleast point out at the end Musk is all in himself. But I feel like they are quite one sided. Nobody has grown a company or production at the rate Telsa has.
9213 2018-05-01 03:27:28 just put a whole bottle of castor oil in my hair if it doesn’t grow 10 inches by tomorrow i’m kms
9214 2018-05-01 03:27:25 Blood sweat and tears. I Didn’t work rigs, mainly pipelines.  Oil and gas has fed me and my family for 28 years.

9217 2018-05-01 03:27:15 okay i know im an Artist ™ but oil paints (and,, paints in general) have such pretentious names like “manganese blue hue”?? it screams: “ohoho i’m an upperclassman that spends over $10000000000 for a tube of paint and i sell blank canvases with ‘’’HIDDEN MEANING’’’ for a living”
9218 2018-05-01 03:27:13 Did some real “man” stuff today. Ya know... paid somebody to change my oil. Paid somebody to change my brakes. Watched Netflix.
9219 2018-05-01 03:27:09 Beats oil and vinegar!
9220 2018-05-01 03:27:04 Still holy shit balls doing same

Nobody will run w it
Someone at Huff Post tried
Schwartzman got story pulled
9221 2018-05-01 03:26:46 The rise in oil prices and increased cost of consumer goods due to tariffs has eliminated any tax break middle class taxpayer received.
9222 2018-05-01 03:26:40 Watching Newsroom for the first time, and got ... a little caught up in the news story and was avidly awaiting the status of the exploding oil rig! WHAT DID BP KNOW? Oh right.
9223 2018-05-01 03:26:33 Except this supposed discomfort only applies to same-sex ships, and that says a lot about the ppl doing the complaining. Jensen isn’t scared of a ship and has on mult occasions just recently encouraged fic regarding oil rigs, cowboys, and Destiel and he was looking fwd to them
9224 2018-05-01 03:26:29 Dry shampoo and essential oil that’s what I do with bullet 10/10

... Where was the oil?!?!?!?!?!!?!
9228 2018-05-01 03:25:47 My lupus flared so I have been  having trouble walking. My boyfriend went to a dispensary and got a CBD oil tincture for me to help control the symptoms and pain. I just looovvvveeee him, man

9231 2018-05-01 03:25:20 STORY TIME! so i get to work today and one of my coworkers is helping a woman try literally every single body scrub in our store. she’s looking at one we don’t have a tester for and asks to smell it. i told her to smell the lotion or oil, they all smell the same.
9232 2018-05-01 03:25:19 @algore Peak Oil. Thoughts? Come on! Share.
9233 2018-05-01 03:25:07 Canada has the third largest oil reserves of any country in the world after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
9234 2018-05-01 03:25:05 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
9235 2018-05-01 03:25:03 I been ballin on you cause you smart and loyal. All my homies know me best they say im fallin for you. And that box be slippery like trynna walk on oil
9236 2018-05-01 03:25:01 Carbon tax  will only be innocuous if it is  refunded to producers of exported oil to the USA. How ridiculous to tax the  export of 3 million barrels of oil a day to the USA where they largely have no CO2 tax burden
9237 2018-05-01 03:24:55 This white man is really lucky I just picked up some oil because he almost hit me  texting and driving and I almost followed him home to beat the brakes off him

9240 2018-05-01 03:24:14 やりたいことが多すぎてやばみある（いつもの）
9241 2018-05-01 03:24:10 Typical.... #canolabeer excuse. I think the oil we get is #amazing enough for cooking and the odd off - label use of WD40 #FarmHer #hacks
9242 2018-05-01 03:24:07 We also have an obligation to take care of this planet. The days of drilling for oil and using oil are coming to an end, and I think everyone sees that.
9243 2018-05-01 03:24:06 Drizzle the oil in the wok.
9244 2018-05-01 03:23:47 For the price of the Iraq war every household in America could have been given solar-wind and batteries.  Instead we went to war for oil and lined the pockets of Cheney and Co.  They turned the CIA into an intelligence fabricating torture mill instead of freeing us all.
9245 2018-05-01 03:23:46 If you deconstruct it it actually makes a lot of sense that it would be tasty. Oil and egg. Perfect.
9246 2018-05-01 03:23:33 No, your a slave to oil and gas and associated taxes. Be a pioneer and break those chains and shackles!
9247 2018-05-01 03:22:42 Post-it notes. *Always* better with coconut oil.
9248 2018-05-01 03:22:35 How much snake oil would be out there if there was no product oversight?  Huh? I see peaceful protests in the news every single day.  I grow food on my property.  I see lemonade stands.  How many people would die of food-borne disease without proper food handling laws?  (more..)
9249 2018-05-01 03:22:27 Kakadugyot pag chachange oil hahaha
9250 2018-05-01 03:22:10 Got essential oil in my eye #justLaurenthings
9251 2018-05-01 03:22:01 Energy East was taking oil to a port on the East coast. There was no money in the project for upgrading the refinery - just for upgrading the port. It was all going to be loaded on tankers.
9252 2018-05-01 03:21:59 OK Canadians Reality Check! Are we only Oil and Gas? I don’t think so. We are much more than a harmful energy source with no future. Let’s pull it together and show who we really are. Diversify, Unify, and Solidify who we are as a nation.#Cdnpoli #oilandgas
9253 2018-05-01 03:21:46 Does the sauna experience in your country involve using Tea Tree Oil? Serious, here individuals will use tea tree oil quite often outside the sauna as well. And, not in an inappropriate manner.
9254 2018-05-01 03:21:40 All I need now is a coconut oil massage 
9255 2018-05-01 03:21:34 I wear a slap cap by Grace Elayae every night!! I spritz my hair with a liiiiittle water and rub some castor oil into it and put the cap on. The next day I let the steam of the shower hit it, add some hair lotion and embrace the day 2/3 fuzz and fluff it out!
9256 2018-05-01 03:21:27 TWITTER. What kind of coconut oil yall use. Everything is dry on ya boi
9257 2018-05-01 03:21:17 リツイートしてくれる方、ありがとう
9258 2018-05-01 03:21:14 After WWII UK Foreign Min held 2 meetings on Middle East policy Bevin said that Middle East countries had gained a lot of wealth from the war & oil but not shared with it public which led to resentment & possible revolution
9259 2018-05-01 03:21:09 time Canadian's demanded the nationalization of the oil and gas industry this way we can have gas priced under 5 cents .
9260 2018-05-01 03:21:07 Dogs are just not good at oil changes
9261 2018-05-01 03:21:03 あとはチラホラTLでも話題に出てるけど土の銃得意勢がどこまで強くなるかってのは気になる
9262 2018-05-01 03:21:01 i know, this is what's always annoyed me about this particular nonsense

if the money wasn't originally iranian in the first place, why would iran want it? its not as if there isn't enough oil in khuzestan already
9263 2018-05-01 03:20:52 That’s a wonderful idea!! I think I’d do that as a Oil painting make it look even more badass! Great idea 
9264 2018-05-01 03:20:51 Thank U Karnataka Assembly Elections for not letting oil prices go up every day. Hoping to have elections every month
9265 2018-05-01 03:20:40 Grabe yung Lavender oil ng Young Living. Pag pinahid ko sa wrist ko or sa neck nagiging amoy  Coconut LOL #LocalNaLocal
9266 2018-05-01 03:20:19 Ain’t nun slick to a can of oil. Remember dat!
9267 2018-05-01 03:20:09 Zoo trip and an oil change? No time for either of those essential activities in my days...gotta make time for both.
9268 2018-05-01 03:20:05 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
9269 2018-05-01 03:20:05 Contemporary artists are not as limited to the materials they use to create art. "Oil on canvas" becomes are array of possibilities from spray paint to fabrics to magazines all providing new and unique interpretations.
9270 2018-05-01 03:20:02 Nah man, its a Dodge.....

Isn't this thing going way up North? Seems like a glorified floating oil rig with potential Chernobyl disaster sprinkled on top
9271 2018-05-01 03:19:49 Tangina gagawa daw kami ng chilli oil
9272 2018-05-01 03:19:46 I live in Canada. They are killing the pipelines everywhere! What I do know is that I pay 2.5 CAD for an aguacatico. Did you even know that at the most we have oil for 10 more years? Are you even aware of what fracking is and why they use it?
9273 2018-05-01 03:19:35 It's all friggin posturing so he can either get a new contract or his snake oil salesmen back in Gillette lol
9274 2018-05-01 03:19:31 Well I guess Alberta could do what BC is doing and attract Amazon and 3000 new IT jobs. Or will Alberta stagnate in the past? @RachelNotley @jkenney Technological innovation is big. A tech hub is required. Digital media and IT grads can't get jobs. So ridiculous. Why? Oil, oil...
9275 2018-05-01 03:19:27 That said, the BC govt aims to limit heavy oil transports by all methods, not just the pipeline, until those responsible can adequately prove a cleanup can be done fast and without cost to the taxpayers, including reimbursement for lost economic activity in the event of a spill.
9276 2018-05-01 03:19:23 I need to go get more black caster oil ima need it
9277 2018-05-01 03:19:18 Definitely the combo. How about you? I like to reheat mine the next day in a frying pan w/ a few drops of oil. If you place a lid on top of the pan, the cheese gets bubbly and the bottom of the pizza gets crispy.
9278 2018-05-01 03:19:15 i have a feeling that the moment i try out oil painting im going to fall in love
9279 2018-05-01 03:19:15 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…

9282 2018-05-01 03:18:30 Hmmm, that's how oil well fires are fought.  How about forest fires? ever here of back burns?  Want to stop evil? kill it dead dont love it.
9283 2018-05-01 03:18:09 So...it's looking like I'll be attending my 1st divisional game at Lucas Oil. 
9/30 v Houston!!! Can't wait!!! #Colts
9284 2018-05-01 03:17:57 Incidentally, each Walmart also has 3 decomposing bodies hidden around the store. If you find one, you win free oil changes, chili, & shotgun shells for life.

9288 2018-05-01 03:16:44 Your governments never expanded the tax net. Ao revenues were less. Depending on Import costs a lot. Oil revenue helps build infrastructure. Congress loot is a burden...
9289 2018-05-01 03:16:11 When your cartridge is almost out so you heat it up with a lighter to have all the oil fall to the bottom

9299 2018-05-01 03:15:14 @funder Scott - a year ago I had a dream that Kushner did the oil deal with Rex and Putin with Trumpsky promising to put Rex in the job. 
After Rex realized there was no oil in that job he wanted out I noticed .
9300 2018-05-01 03:15:10 He'll probably drill an oil well at center ice.

9314 2018-05-01 03:12:53 He is our governor, and we need his leadership here at Wisconsin's only oil refinery. It is appropriate for him to be here. No apologies from us in Superior/Douglas County!!  
9315 2018-05-01 03:12:39 I challenge you to point to a regulation which does not actually benefit the Bigs (Big Pharma, Big Oil, Big Agra, etc.), or which isn't watered down from pre-1980.
9316 2018-05-01 03:12:27 Every time the Cons complain about the Liberals funding things that they are personally not in agreement with (ie, any form of dissent or research against big oil)...they remind us what it was like under a regime that held the population hostage to their ideology. #HoldTheRations
9317 2018-05-01 03:12:24 Need a good laugh?....
Vancouver residents driving to Wash State USA to buy cheaper gas. Alberta’s only customer for oil is USA (Gas is made from Alberta Oil) 
Another joke..
If BC’s worried bout Tankers why did they just approve a Kitimat BC Liquid Gas Tanker Export Terminal?
9318 2018-05-01 03:12:23 I think it took a while for CBSA to catch on after they started labelling as “hemp oil”. This was done for US purposes of course. Glad the exemptions are now available but always worrisome when your medicine is subject to customs scrutiny.

9330 2018-05-01 03:10:14 I'm pretty sure we are living in the end-times, but I'm going to keep taking fish oil just in case I survive long enough to reap the benefits of healthy skin and nails.

9332 2018-05-01 03:10:01 Hey @CPC_HQ shills, the #CarbonTax isn't costing Canadians money, relying on oil and pipelines IS costing Canadians and taxpayers. We need to diversify and open the economy of Canada.  We say NO to #KinderMorgan and pipelines. #cdnpoli #StopKM #protecttheinlet #CPCBigots

9335 2018-05-01 03:09:33 Hon Andrew Little just said in Parliament, "we don't want to see an abrupt transition" from oil and gas. But is an unexpected, outright ban on new offshore exploration not the most abrupt decision that's possible?! Should transitions not be led as demand reduces over time? #nzpol

9341 2018-05-01 03:08:20 @GovWalker @SuperiorPolice @SuperiorESDPW I'm glad to hear we will have transparency in the oil refinery investigation. Many of us in the community are encouraged with strong leadership & trust from our city, county, and state officials.

9343 2018-05-01 03:07:50 @LisaVanderpump @VanderpumpDogs where can I send some pet friendly @ZilisLLC CBD oil for the shelter dogs? Helped my pets with anxiety, skin disorders and mobility. I really want to help. #rescuemom #catmom #cbdoil #zilisambassador
9344 2018-05-01 03:07:45 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's #oil.
9345 2018-05-01 03:07:44 I wouldn't call oil our primary resource. Perhaps the most profitable at the moment, but "primary" ignores our true strength in the diversity of our resources. It may be Alberta's primary resource, but not Canada's. It can't be ignored, but doesn't represent our future.
9346 2018-05-01 03:07:40 BC or other provinces should build more oil refinery, instead of replying on the US company.  Why we always dependent on US for oil? Don’t we have crude oil in Canada?? @jjhorgan
9347 2018-05-01 03:07:29 I been did that lol damn near was in there boxing with moms she talking about she was using it with caster oil for her hair I’m like what

9349 2018-05-01 03:07:11 Its been about oil all along. Putin must have been going crazy when he saw Cheney/Haliburton trash countries for oil and wants in on it. Get trump in, pruitt will open the natl parks, tariff on solar panels, raise the park fees=less people...its all about the oil money
9350 2018-05-01 03:07:11 Stress! Water and consistent skincare helps. If you can afford it it's crazy expensive but Sunday Riley UFO oil is amazing.

9359 2018-05-01 03:05:56 Health ins goes up every year, interest because the economy is stronger, stocks always cycle, and oil is adjusting to production levels and demand. Why the surprise. These things were predictable.

9374 2018-05-01 03:04:22 Today in "my mom is crazier than yours": she was trying to encourage me to use CBD oil to combat anxiety, and I informed her that there is no fucking way that's happening until a LOT more research has been done on it.
9375 2018-05-01 03:04:21 Bio oil berkesan tp kena consume atleast 3 months baru nampak hasil. My friend dulu kena chicken pox and dia pakai bio oil je nak hilangkan scars tu
9376 2018-05-01 03:04:08 Make your unbelievably shiny tresses? Hair oil!
9377 2018-05-01 03:04:05 Man what a Monday, fish wasn’t biting, lost oil pressure in the truck, needs a new oil pump, I had to pull the truck home (scary), THEN dropped my fries all in the floor board. I swear what else can go wrong
9378 2018-05-01 03:04:03 He lost me when he said $300 oil wouldn’t hurt the economy much - may as well screamed “It’s different this time” from a mountain top...
9379 2018-05-01 03:04:00 “I’ve got oil and razor blades.” 
“What kind of party is this?”
9380 2018-05-01 03:03:44 @HaydnSchneider have you tried CBD oil at all? I want to see if it helps with my anxiety!
9381 2018-05-01 03:03:43 @VinnieTortorich I bought the Trader Joe's olive oil and red wine vinegar dressing because it has zero sugar.  Then I looked at the ingredients and it's got canola and soybean oil.  Wtf #bullshit
9382 2018-05-01 03:03:38 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
9383 2018-05-01 03:03:37 Too late - more like a oil spill that crosses both the Pacific and Atlantic.  Recovery and cleanup will take decades.
9384 2018-05-01 03:03:36 Olive oil
9385 2018-05-01 03:03:16 BS.  They create expensive urine at best. The worst? No vitamin maker can prove what's in their products. Modern snake oil.
9386 2018-05-01 03:03:05 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
9387 2018-05-01 03:03:04 “We should have kept the oil” was projection

9391 2018-05-01 03:02:17 rose hip oil (as a moisturizer) and a face roller have changed my life! I use tea tree oil to target breakouts but very sparingly because it can dry your skin out too

keeping the roller in the fridge for a bit beforehand can help target more inflammation and tighten pores too 
9392 2018-05-01 03:02:13 Either the popping oil formula has changed, or my 30’s stomach has revolted, because I cannot eat theater popcorn anymore. It makes me horribly ill afterwards.

9407 2018-05-01 03:00:20 Soften dry hair: Heat a half cup olive oil (don’t boil it), apply to your hair. Let it set for 45 minutes, then shampoo and thoroughly rinse
9408 2018-05-01 03:00:17 #bcpoli @cknw @bc1 @charlesadler Mr Chuck , yes it is a Fact that oil goes by ship out side Vancouver Island - but that is just a Red Herring it would be a relevant FACT if they came down the inside passage between the Island & the Coast - just thought i would point that out
9409 2018-05-01 03:00:13 I have seen some beautiful pictures of monkeys in oil.

9443 2018-05-01 02:55:25 Fire fighters use fire to fight fire quite regularly. Explosives are used to blow out oil well fires. Defending your family with a firearm isn't hate; it's one of the most loving acts. Your metaphors don't hold water. @KyleKashuv thank you for retweeting this for us.
9444 2018-05-01 02:55:18 Stop giving our oil away to big oil corporations. Lower gas prices for us here by building a refinery in Alberta. We are fighting amongst ourselves and Big Oil is laughing all the way to the bank. #oilandgas #BigOil
9445 2018-05-01 02:55:16 The cycle of Dollar-Oil-Weaponary is due to KSA. Iran is not a part of it. Saddam n Qazafi were. But the funny thing is that US lost it all after taking those dictators down. So they should do it indirectly with more less-efficinet budgeting to terrorism.

9454 2018-05-01 02:53:43 You must cleanse morning and night to remove excess oil, acne-causing bacteria, and impurities from the skin. Then follow with a toner if you have oily skin and finish with an oil-free moisturizer to balance the pH levels of your skin and keep your skin supple and hydrated.

9461 2018-05-01 02:53:07 Watching @JerseyShore without @lopushinsky7 dumb. Let’s go to oil city after.
9462 2018-05-01 02:53:04 Besides the project financing opportunities, the Lithium market is in need of a solution as it currently is based on direct producer to purchaser deals - a chance to pull a 'Marc Rich' put it on the 'chain' & create a market framework like he did w spot oil  #MoveBigMoveQuiet
9463 2018-05-01 02:52:44 exfoliate for dryness and moisturize. Coconut oil or jojoba oil is great for the face and like I know you’ll think oil + oil will equal more oil but I swear it’ll control your oil production later in the day
9464 2018-05-01 02:52:26 What kind of oil are you using? I cook them on a griddle pan with no oil on low heat and haven’t had any smoke issues
9465 2018-05-01 02:52:01 Girl the new one is terrible. They use too much oil
9466 2018-05-01 02:51:58 It sounds like you like the taste of coconut oil. But if you want an oil that you can use to cook sweet and savory foods, try avocado oil.
9467 2018-05-01 02:51:39 I dont think GAY lube oil has ever said he was a christian, pretty sure he believes in bio essentialism not sure what spiritual/religious beliefs he has. 
I will say there has to be a higher power - we can only see in 3 dimensions dude. We aren't at that high of a level as beings
9468 2018-05-01 02:51:28 The infused cilantro oil I made for the FMK food truck on Saturday had them grill fresh bowls jumpin 
9469 2018-05-01 02:51:26 Thanks for reaching out to me! What kind of questions do you have about CBD Oil?
9470 2018-05-01 02:51:08 Sauteed in coconut oil with some black pepper

9476 2018-05-01 02:49:59 Do you have any idea how important our environment is to our economy (and our lives)? It far outweighs any benefit of the tar sands to Canadians. In the long term, we can adapt to life without the tarsands (and oil), but with them, all life is endangered.
9477 2018-05-01 02:49:55 Turmeric oil has been blessing the kid.
9478 2018-05-01 02:49:54 just straight cbd oil has been helping me a lot. i found a good brand and take it twice a day...a little extra today!
9479 2018-05-01 02:49:54 But this magic oil is for safe for you, your baby and your grandma! It’s legal because it has less than .3 percent THC 
9480 2018-05-01 02:49:51 plus leff would have no idea how to attach anything to a car. i'd be shocked if he could do an oil change.

9487 2018-05-01 02:48:58 Id like to know more about the brother in oil and gas from the Midwest.  Also Note: he doesn’t cringe about his response to the racist remarks directed at Michael Steele? That’s called transactional politics. It’s also called no integrity. No core. He’s as much a fraud as Trump.
9488 2018-05-01 02:48:55 Where there’s more oil. Yayaman ka sa kabilang buhay hahahaha.

9491 2018-05-01 02:48:19 start putting lavender oil and rosewater+glycerin in it. still puts in the equal amount of work with a boost but feels calming.
9492 2018-05-01 02:47:54 #nzqt "Asked for precisely no advice" says Simplistic Simon, says he who bypassed process, allowed permits in a 200k Hectare sized Conservation area. 

The World is transitioning. The industry is. We import some 97% of oil used. Countries who *supply* us are *ALSO transitioning*
9493 2018-05-01 02:47:47 I hope you're right, but I am not bullish on higher prices until we see something concrete on Iran or a return to strong draws.  I took some profits on Thurs from a couple higher beta oil positions and will re-enter when there is clarity, which could come any day. Give or take.

9499 2018-05-01 02:47:03 Oil is a commodity and not s product in the 4 th quadrant of  life cycle to be milked at 300 dollars a barrel . It will collapse the world economy , at least 2/3rd of the world can’t afford such amount for their energy needs
9500 2018-05-01 02:46:52 How about this joke, "I change my car oil today, but I didn't have time to dispose of the oil. I didn't know Wolf would dunk her face in it. It did give her that oily look." Her face was so.
9501 2018-05-01 02:46:44 I smother my face in coconut oil every night..and every night my dogs proceed to try and eat me alive because I smell so good

9511 2018-05-01 02:45:52 Notice that nobody said anything including @realDonaldTrump about selling Eric, oil in juniors head or Ivanka being full of shit
9512 2018-05-01 02:45:46 Blend 2 tablespoons green beans with 2 cups bluefish. Mix into  Olive Oil. Drain through cheesecloth Serve on bread

9514 2018-05-01 02:45:19 Odd #nzqt by PM. When questioned about whether oil/gas ban will do anything for the environment; she talks lyrically about "urgency of action" and Kiribas/Tuvalu. When questioned about economic effects, we're told permits and gas use will exist for 30 years plus
9515 2018-05-01 02:45:11 Literally just soak in a full bath with a spoon full of coconut oil, you skin will feel super smooth and silky 
9516 2018-05-01 02:44:51 Oh how lovely of them!  How did the organic shea butter, extra virgin coconut oil and fair trade cocoa butter in this bath oil leave your skin feeling?
9517 2018-05-01 02:44:48 Yes, go to school. Don't do what people at my old HS did and think that you can just make big bucks for the rest of your life without a university education in the oil fields. World is moving forward, if they went to uni maybe they wouldn't have to depend on pipelines for work.
9518 2018-05-01 02:44:43 You might like sipping cocktails on your sunny beach, prof.

But a lot of Gnomes prefer the underground darkness, the cogs, and the crude oil dripping down their pants ..you know...the old Gnomeregan days.

9520 2018-05-01 02:44:30 Coconut oil makes the best fried rice evar. And I know everyone hates ham & pineapple, but fried rice with that combo with coconut oil is bomb.
9521 2018-05-01 02:44:21 So buhari went to USA to discuss on how to import USA agricultural products into Nigeria at the same time saying he can't force USA to buy Nigerian oil(which is the only thing he has to offer) and to declare his love for helicopters.
Carry scripted journalist go press conference.
9522 2018-05-01 02:44:15 Oh, never go to PepBoys. If you go to a chain, just do it to get your oil changed. Mechanical work, ASE certified shop that is tidy only. Don’t go anywhere near Walmart. But I’m thankful PepBoys and Walmart and jacked-up trucks. Mistakes are good to fix.
9523 2018-05-01 02:43:56 Does coconut oil sheen actually exist!!! I know you Bein funny but you got me excited
9524 2018-05-01 02:43:55 Actually, I can. I always make my own broth, this is good for mei fun too.
1 tbsp butter
4 tbsp Braggs soy sauce
a light shake a cayenne
a HEAVY shake (3/4 tsp?) chili powder
a splash of olive oil
1 almost heavy shave of garlic powder
a dash of salt and pepper to taste

9529 2018-05-01 02:43:32 I foresee Deep-fried coconut oil as the next state fair food craze. For this, you deserve a Nobel prize.
9530 2018-05-01 02:43:24 Please. I pop my own popcorn (no disgusting palm oil for me!) and make my own mimosas. I don't trust people who don't break bullshit capitalist rules.
9531 2018-05-01 02:43:11 Soap. Hole. Wax. Oil. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Wax Nation attacked
9532 2018-05-01 02:42:51 Oreos contain palm oil.  Which the industry is massively causing deforestation to grow it, threatening mainly animals including the orangutan.  So you aren’t eating animal products but the ingredients are causing harm to them.
9533 2018-05-01 02:42:49 don't worry tho, the gas and oil companies will still be rich.
9534 2018-05-01 02:42:30 You could probably make a decent tzatziki-esque dressing.
Maybe like blended cucumber and dill in a little oil. Would get the same flavors and aromas, and I think in the case of tzatziki, flavor's more important than the consistency.

9537 2018-05-01 02:41:38 I dont see any reason to even think about a short if you are looking at this technically. Oil only moves higher from here on medium to longer term basis.
9538 2018-05-01 02:41:28 Please cite the legislation and why is makes industry uncompetitive. Are you actually suggesting the large oil companies aren’t relevant to “the industry”?
9539 2018-05-01 02:41:21 I just made a pretty tasty tilapia with Thai chili lime butter. I pan seared it in coconut oil. YUM. 

I’m pan searing everything in coconut oil from here on out. Eggs. Vegetables. Snickers bars. Skittles. Shoe laces. You name it, I will pan sear that shit in coconut oil.

9543 2018-05-01 02:41:02 Here's a bee for your bonnet: they have to honor the permits already released and if the fossil fuel companies find any oil or gas there's going to be a whole lot of drilling going on.
9544 2018-05-01 02:40:59 Bridges still whining about plans to stop new oil exploration #nzqt

9567 2018-05-01 02:37:41 An oil refinery gets a "financial hardship" exemption permitting it to poison our environment; meanwhile, people fleeing persecution are stymied at the border and denied asylum.
9568 2018-05-01 02:37:38 I know FOR SURE that it's butter on MY popcorn. We STILL don't know what's in that oil they use--!
9569 2018-05-01 02:37:34 @ONenergy This is veny unethical that gas prices are being raised without any concern. Canada is the largest producer of crude oil. We send oil to US to refine only. Then why are we paying almost double retail prices then US?  In US averag price is still $2.54 per gallon 0.589C/L
9570 2018-05-01 02:37:34 @freebeergregg really enjoying the Freebeer breakfast challenges. Maybe next @FBHWJustin brings in the Honda and changes a tire, the oil, or the battery
9571 2018-05-01 02:37:06 That's almost 2/3 the population of island nations that are mostly renewable. Mostly, except for the oil imports used to balance seasonal power needs.
9572 2018-05-01 02:37:04 Trump is helping the cause for the cooperate oil companies... so what’s new... rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer .

9586 2018-05-01 02:35:18  good joke sir! Please also compare the amount of crude oil before 2014.
9587 2018-05-01 02:35:09 All I gotta say is I put some lavender oil on my neck to sleep and I was having one hell of a dream experience

9592 2018-05-01 02:33:28 By that logic it's Canada's oil so Alberta is entitled to about 1/10 of it.

9598 2018-05-01 02:32:58 w/ the Iran deal. But Netanyahu wasn't satisfied, he wanted war. Why? because Israel don't want to pay $1.1B they owe Iran for oil pre 1979. Now, he's using @POTUS 45 w/Iran's 2007 nuclear program to beat the drums of war. While stealing more land & build more illegal settlement.

9604 2018-05-01 02:32:04 Ahhh.. The pork spicy garlic (extra pork) is good. I'd recommend it ^^. My friends and I tried Swiss cheese with it... It's ok in small increments. other good topping options would be seaweed or black garlic oil.
9605 2018-05-01 02:31:53 What u got for the oil
9606 2018-05-01 02:31:52 I'm super discouraged right now. I feel like I'm running in place, against a wall, on an oil slick, and there may or may not be a pack of rabid dogs at my heels. 

When i dare to let myself hope, for anything, I'm shattered. And people call me pessimistic.

9611 2018-05-01 02:31:22 I had to report out on why my Canadian market was not mirroring my US counterparts in the oil and gas sector.

9613 2018-05-01 02:31:01 Trudeau didn’t bring in jobs. He also didn’t lay off any oil and gas workers. That’s not a government role.

9618 2018-05-01 02:30:49 I wish I didn’t know why but it always comes back to the same answer: money. The oil(igarchs) have their fortunes invested in the much dated petroleum scheme and have done everything in their wallets power to prevent these safer options at the expense of our planet...

9622 2018-05-01 02:30:37 politics aside...
FOX creates characters like Ingraham. They trot her out for her opinion about a comedienne on a NEWS program. Think about that.
Stop being lead by fictional characters.

It's not about oil vs schools, or teachers vs military...it's ONLY about profit.
9623 2018-05-01 02:30:34 Really?  Let's see whose allowance gets cut to pay for that oil, shall we?

9627 2018-05-01 02:30:11 So yes we could use a refinery & hopefully reduce fuel prices, but where do we get the oil from and how should it be transported... Rail, truck, or pipeline? Which is safest moving through communities? Surely this is an easy answer.
9628 2018-05-01 02:29:43 If they're so interested in freeing up more oil for export then there OBVIOUS choice is SOLAR ENERGY. And the one thing the Saudi Arabia has more of than oil is AN UNLIMITED SUPPY OF SUNSHINE!
9629 2018-05-01 02:29:22 every old person be recommending oil of olay
9630 2018-05-01 02:29:04 Not exactly that black and white. Oil industry rebounded earlier as companies learned to make money at lower price per barrel...just not in Canada. Many Canadian rigs and services went south due to the royalties, tax, regulations and bottlenecks.
9631 2018-05-01 02:28:50 Wait... oil is low?
9632 2018-05-01 02:28:49 I need a oil change car wash all that

9634 2018-05-01 02:28:36 Pretty odd doesn't it seem that no protestor is even bitching about thr rolling pipeline but goes apeshit over a stationary one. Leads one to wonder just what in the name of jehova is going on. I guess the antis can apply to fluffy to hire a bunch of  anti oil nut bars to protest
9635 2018-05-01 02:28:22 Emu oil!
9636 2018-05-01 02:28:20 Jason, Why don’t you vacay in one of the dictator regimes that you buy your oil from. Go to Nigeria and be free!! Ha ha. No, you just love their oil and don’t mind that they kill . Hypocrite. @PrideToronto @OttCapitalPride @HalifaxPride

9649 2018-05-01 02:25:49 Israel need an enemy in order to keep Palestinians in that open air prison, while they pillage Gaza's natural resources...natural Gas/oil. So, Iran became that bogeyman. And every year he demanded US give them more aid $$ for some perceived threat. Pres. Obama alleviated that...

9659 2018-05-01 02:24:20 “To keep people safe from harm”, no, more like keep oil industry safe from scrutiny. And of course you are welcome to your opinion on Mr Jefferson’s intentions
9660 2018-05-01 02:24:01 The issue is how much of Canada's oil is refined here. I know we import oil and refine it, though not nearly as much as we need. Virtually ALL gasoline used in Canada is imported.

9666 2018-05-01 02:23:18 Chemicals seems too low. Imagine too many upstream oil producers clogged in your intake.
9667 2018-05-01 02:23:11 If not for the anti-Semites in the West supported and encouraged by Arab Oil money and given validity by the UN. The Palestinian farce would have ended a long time ago.

9669 2018-05-01 02:23:02 Today is 111th anniversary of establishment of Baku Individualist Anarchists and Terrorists association.

Back then, a terrorist would mean practical revolutionary who robs, kidnaps or kills rich oil barons.
9670 2018-05-01 02:22:41 How much did the Saudis pay for your soul? That’s weird, the cry not 10 years ago was we need to eliminate our reliance on foreign oil.
9671 2018-05-01 02:22:03 The capitalists deceive us into believing that they have rights to land, oil and other concessions.
9672 2018-05-01 02:22:01 First oil well was in PA . How is that not the most important
9673 2018-05-01 02:21:20 Thats the issue. Ctax will generate tons of rev but govt will use it as slush fund. So much so that even at 3x price of oil it might only reduce Ghgs by 5%. Reality is that targets are unattainable. They will start with $50/ton then say sorry targets unattainable so need  $300/t.
9674 2018-05-01 02:21:10 I mean, Jensen himself legit said he wanted to do a western romcom with Misha, and himself told the fandom not to let him down (in regards to telling them to write oil rig Destiel fanfiction). It's a matter of time/place/context/respectfulness.
9675 2018-05-01 02:21:10 “Alkalised water” and “activated almonds”? WTF? Why no snake oil? Or is there snake oil in the “emu meatballs”?

9678 2018-05-01 02:20:52 So BS. This is about oil / money / and US being able to put a corrupt puppet in as the leader of Iran. It has always been the plan.
9679 2018-05-01 02:20:44 Water based probs wouldn't be cut with oil, but I dunno. Regardless, I think I'm gonna get some J Lube!

9684 2018-05-01 02:20:22 Stallions sounds a bit generic. Wildcatters would be unique and oil related, subtle oilers nod. I remember everyone being lukewarm about the Texans name when it was announced.
9685 2018-05-01 02:20:15 Forget oil, hydroelectric, and wind power. We could sustain the whole damn country from the gaslighting over the past couple years.
9686 2018-05-01 02:19:59 I suppose if Iran could prevent ships from entering and exiting the Persian Gulf with the help of modern artillery targeting the Gulf of Oman the oil trade might just suffer in a major way.
9687 2018-05-01 02:19:56 Jason. You are nonsense. Sad you would sell out foreign  to obstruct your own country’s Ethical oil. It is not only terrorist that toss  off buildings. It is also moderates in dictator regimes that toss our  off buildings. And Jason helps them do it

9700 2018-05-01 02:18:48 Stopped by my parents and my dad asked how my anxiety has been. When I said “not great” he straight up materialized a bottle of CBD oil into his hand. He willed it into existence.

9708 2018-05-01 02:17:49 They do it to switch winter fuel to summer.  They use different chemicals. Still excluding known reasons like taxes and price of oil, there is a significant price increase
9709 2018-05-01 02:17:43 Well, first gas is always more expensive in spring as refineries switch over.  Second,  the big refinery fire.  Lastly, our only customer for oil is USA, if we expand to foreign markets we increase revenue & have financial leverage.  We can ask more for the oil we sell to the USA
9710 2018-05-01 02:17:06 Ok - lots of talk about a “robust regime” but what about that “world class” at best 25% recovery of oil product that even KM has admitted to as best case spill recovery scenario?

9722 2018-05-01 02:15:45 when ur not straightening it just brush it wet and try using an oil or mousse in it and then let it naturally dry, if you brush curly hair dry it damages it which is probably why it doesn’t straighten well

9725 2018-05-01 02:15:15 Do you think putting really bitting sanctions that include impounding ships that transferred oil to the DPRK and
 some Chinese Companies;  working with Japan to increase their Military and subtly adding the possibility of Japan acquiring nuclear weapons;...
9726 2018-05-01 02:15:09 Sure we did.  Obama was a well known liar and shill for WallSt. and the MIC.  Droning civilians, let alone even being in the ME.  Regime change = oil, or someone went off the US dollar as trade currency.

9731 2018-05-01 02:13:30 Indeed. He's counting on his 'I'm-just-like-you' persona selling snake oil to those who can least afford it..so that he can sell his 'I-wanna-be-just-like-you' real estate hotshots to line his own pockets.

9735 2018-05-01 02:13:02 Rockefellers are joined at the hip also.  I lived not far from the first oil strikes in the USA. My husbands family had stock in Standard Oil and pennzilo oil companies. Rockefellers gained a virtual monopoly on oil in the USA

9777 2018-05-01 02:07:35 This is how Colombia will be when, with Fracking and carbon, the economy becomes dependent on oil, forgetting about our agricultural industry and we will be at half a step away from being with Venezuela with Duque :)
9778 2018-05-01 02:07:04 Calling out Israel on their crimes is not being anti-Semitic at all. It's an excuse pro-Israeli atrocity lunatics use to silence opposition. It'll be like South Africa one day. The youth of the US will be more informed, and will politically force the US to stop supporting Israel.
9779 2018-05-01 02:06:53 I’m so pro death penalty I’ve been a state’s witness for an execution. We should try it more often to see if it’s a deterrent.
9780 2018-05-01 02:06:40 Used up all our luck this weekend. Transmission croaked in wife's 2003 suburban. She's not very happy. I stopped on the way home to get oil and filters, then it just died. Please don't tell her to get a new car unless you're gonna make payments. She's cheap.

9783 2018-05-01 02:06:29 Do you know if Mr. Hightower is pro medical marijuana or the use of oil obtained from Colo. based co. for charlottes web. I hwatched a show where Vir. Gov. supported bill to allow some to buy it. He didn't want his taxpayers moving.
9784 2018-05-01 02:06:29 @BillHightowerAL Mr. Hightower this is my second text to you. I don't want to hound you but I would like to know your stance on med. marijuana or oil from charlottes web  so one can legally order it. Please  Someone from your campaign can of course respond. Thankyou
9785 2018-05-01 02:06:29 @BillHightowerAL I am not a smoker but I do want to know where you stand on medical marijuana or the oil. Alabama could learn a lesson from Virginia and what they did so as not to lose taxpayers who were considering moving so family could have legal access to charlottes web oil.

9801 2018-05-01 02:03:38 ps. higher oil prices helps russia as well in case anyone is curious, which begs a question....anyone else notice the price of gas climbing every week? Who does that benefit?

9806 2018-05-01 02:03:24 Quite right. Besides the fact that they don't want our oil products reaching tide water in an efficient manner.  Point blank.

9819 2018-05-01 02:02:17 this is a play, so sad that all are following along again....this is being drummed up between 666 Broadway/Israel/Saudi Arabia...it is so obvious and yet here comes the slow pitch to war...and what will we americans get? higher oil prices and another 100 years of death in the ME.
9820 2018-05-01 02:02:04 To be fair, the petroleum crash was a natural tick-tock of the market after prices rose so high that alternatives became viable for the first time.

But Venezuelan government axed other sectors thinking oil was invincible, like American baby boomers before their housing crash.
9821 2018-05-01 02:01:58 Funny story , I was at the local Kentucky lake bait shop today right , some old guys are in front of me bitching about the price of what I seen was the cbd oil. They had no clue what it was they thought it was scent you put on ur lure for 80$. I just sat back and laughed.

9834 2018-05-01 02:00:19 All I'm saying is, 35 cents of every liter is simply US exchange. The Cdn dollar is low because it is a proxy for the country's economy. Without investment, it languishes, even though oil prices have been going up. Transit taxes were lower then too. We didn't have a carbon tax.
9835 2018-05-01 02:00:18 Well there goes my raise.  we can put men up in space, but we can’t make electric cars a must, and get rid of our dependency on oil/gas Gimme a break!  They are all in bed together.
9836 2018-05-01 02:00:17 Yes use all methods, can't hurt.  But with her bronchitis, smoking would be painful, and the volume needed would need to be in form of oil suppositories.  Hope you're in a cannabis friendly state.  The chemo and radiation is so dangerous.
9837 2018-05-01 02:00:14 @marcorubio are you kidding me? Come to my state filled with blue collar oil and gas workers. They are saving in taxes and their companies are breathing more, spending more, and hiring more.
9838 2018-05-01 02:00:10 Yeah, just look at how those Iranians flew planes   into the twin towers, those bastards! Oh wait. Those were all mostly Saudis. Well, those Iranian bastards did create and fund #AlQaeda and #Isis! Oh wait. That was the Saudis too! Wait, Iran is our enemy? Really?  #Oil

9844 2018-05-01 01:59:35 @realDonaldTrump would you please tell me why the price of oil is up, why the price of food is up since you are president.  Many people will struggle if things continue like this.
9845 2018-05-01 01:59:01 castor oil!!
9846 2018-05-01 01:58:47 I suppose if I just idly tossed in the thought that we might consider nationalizing the oil industry with a view towards transitioning to renewable sources and mitigating the damage already done, it might tighten a few sphincters...
9847 2018-05-01 01:58:40 @GeneralJohnK I have to believe you did not call Trump an idiot. The alternative is knowing a US General is a bigger coward than a former oil company executive and knows it as well as the people who alledge to have heard you say it.
9848 2018-05-01 01:58:37 okay so nabuthan kog na bukal bukal na oil sa kamot 
9849 2018-05-01 01:58:30 Trump, zinke and the oil and energy companies are fleecing the country.
9850 2018-05-01 01:58:25 Trump the Whitehouse is running smooth, it looks like a train wreck. You are getting things done like opening up areas for drilling in sensitive areas and rolling back the safeguards put in place to prevent another Horizon oil spill.

9852 2018-05-01 01:58:24 Those talented Anons, @AnonScan & others, might want to make a list of where (outside USA) these traitors are invested. I heard BHO is invested in Africa/oil, Kerry in Iran I believe, P. Ryan in Puerto Rico? List where they're $$s are & the conflict of interest becomes clear!
9853 2018-05-01 01:58:15 Big corporations that spent lots on fossil fuels. How much is a barrel of hemp oil & getting the resin waste floating?
9854 2018-05-01 01:58:11 You seem to know so much about aliens. That being the case you also know the technology exists to have this mess in the ocean cleaned up within a few weeks time if only the government would allow it to be released. But they wont, because it would make the oil industry redundant
9855 2018-05-01 01:58:10 Also impossible if you build pipelines. Your job is not to compromise on the environment. The environment comes first. The oil patch is nowhere near as important.
9856 2018-05-01 01:58:04 Eucalyptus oil works wonders.  Highly recommend for headaches.

9863 2018-05-01 01:56:56 There isn't. People are dumb as shit.
9864 2018-05-01 01:56:49 Along with uncertainty of the future with an oil field burning up over seas and everything going on between governments
9865 2018-05-01 01:56:43 The emails literally say they are modeling this on the Peace Corp or Teach for American. Are those programs also awful “neoliberalism?” 

Meanwhile, Ryan Zinke is currently giving shut loads of parkland to oil companies. 

But yeah, let’s take a deep dive into 
HRC again.
9866 2018-05-01 01:56:34 Why were we paying GFC prices under national when oil went down to $30 US a barrel . Is that the reason you shelved that report you were going to do about us paying too much for gas .??? You did not fix it either Judith ex energy minister .
9867 2018-05-01 01:56:23 Aaaa girl your hair is amazing too! God bless Moroccan oil 
9868 2018-05-01 01:56:16 Iran is the ideal partner—given its size, oil, and the intellectual power of Iranians (especially Iranian women)—of the US in the Middle East. Iran lies between Russia and the rest and has a military reach that covers the Mediterranean and the Indus Valley. And it is MUSLIM.
9869 2018-05-01 01:56:12 Yeah I do that too! Along with peppermint oil all over my chest and neck and forehead it does help too
9870 2018-05-01 01:56:06 The amount of money, Nigeria makes yearly from crude oil is more than the amount of money, South Africa makes from it's total exports yearly
9871 2018-05-01 01:55:58 Cannabidiol oil is used for health purposes, but it is controversial. There is some confusion about what it is and the effect it has on the human body cbd oil is great for nerve pain and stress

9875 2018-05-01 01:55:18 So pretty much everyone says my room smells like an old person’s because I keep putting peppermint oil in my defuser. 
9876 2018-05-01 01:54:50 The products are made with fruit (Kokum Butter from India) and Marula Oil (Africa's Beauty Secret) #BlerdDating They were made with TOS of LOVE!
9877 2018-05-01 01:54:42 I was cooking with coconut oil 
Paused, and put some on my face

Cooking with wine is fun

9878 2018-05-01 01:54:39 AND opened Iran up to sell oil .......
9879 2018-05-01 01:54:20 That little David Hogg boy is laughable...
9880 2018-05-01 01:54:18 Had an accident at work. Spilled hot fryer oil on my foot...I’m okay for now.
9881 2018-05-01 01:54:12 4/28/17:  President Trump issued an executive order seeking to open offshore areas to oil drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic.
9882 2018-05-01 01:54:12 Everyone is different boo! For me all of those things work (i use coconut oil instead of castor), you just gotta find the natural remedies that work for you
9883 2018-05-01 01:54:06 What will happen to the oil underneath if it is not used ?????
9884 2018-05-01 01:54:00 Why does everybody that works at a gas station or oil change shop have a charger????
9885 2018-05-01 01:53:57 time for another oil change  which means another 3 hour wait at the dealership
9886 2018-05-01 01:53:39 We had some saudis visits to europe, is this what they've installed? Also Dutch mosques were payed by foreign money to boost it, including saudis. And prob not only just in our country. I think the millions of money going to the oil states aren't always put into good use by them.
9887 2018-05-01 01:53:22 Just spilled all this damn coconut oil on my bed, iyam sickkkk 
9888 2018-05-01 01:53:21 And some coconut oil or some vitamins lmao

9896 2018-05-01 01:52:39 President Trump, what can you do about the price of crude oil? It’s at the highest level in four years. Why is it so expensive? @realDonaldTrump
9897 2018-05-01 01:52:08 i am very curious, because I was going to use that or CBD oil. Need something for my Tendinitis in my elbow
9898 2018-05-01 01:52:00 Check out Liz and Markus' conversation about the Myrtle Herb and Oil. This is an herb that doesn't get nearly as much attention as it should, and is great for use in magick, medicine, and food.

Listen on Soundcloud, iTunes, or Stitcher today.
9899 2018-05-01 01:51:59 Again varies ship to ship and based on location. US, Europe and China have ECA (Emission Control Areas) where by law ships are supposed to burn only LSMGO (Low Sulphur Marine Gas Oil). That's basically Low sulphur diesel. Some ships use IFO - blend of diesel/heavy fuel oil

9903 2018-05-01 01:51:35 Where'd you get za'atar? One of my favorite childhood snacks was dipping warm pita in za'atar mixed with olive oil. I miss it :(
9904 2018-05-01 01:51:25 I’ve taken ginger shots, Vick’s bath’s, oil diffuser, so yes I’ll try vinegar 
9905 2018-05-01 01:51:20 That will be my next car purchase.   Tired of being screwed by oil companies and the BC gov't.
9906 2018-05-01 01:51:14 Indeed. It's all part of the grand plan to further destabilize the Middle East and get some people to sell weapons and pump free oil. An unsactioned and economically stable Iran is a sub-regional threat to the US' biggest Middle East allies; Saudi & Israel.
9907 2018-05-01 01:51:12 I got an essential oil called "love more" and now all I can smell in my room is cinnamon roll. It's really making me love food more
9908 2018-05-01 01:51:04 Why?! It’s highly overrated food at the best of times. Never was able to eat pasta. It’s so bad that it needs a sauce. Not a steak nor ribs on the menu. What should a guy eat? The stale French bread that needs oil to digest?! Give me bangers & mash any time, hold the onions
9909 2018-05-01 01:51:03 Had a nightmare last night where I failed my practical driving exam because I didn’t know where the oil was.
I know where it is.
Why does my brain do this to me?
9910 2018-05-01 01:50:54 I’m ready to be covered in oil and gas and showing up with flowers in my hands 
9911 2018-05-01 01:50:47 Remember this man is, essentially, a crook. Has been,  is and will continue to be a snake oil pedlar.
9912 2018-05-01 01:50:40 Riveting beard exchange with @JimmyG_10 

Q- Is the beard a new thing? Is it something you do every offseason? Is that a playoff hockey beard?
A. "I don’t know. It’s kind of happening. Everyone keeps telling me I’ve got to get this beard oil so I’ve got to get on that.”
9913 2018-05-01 01:50:37 Q: What do you get when you mix holy water with castor oil?

A: A religious movement.
9914 2018-05-01 01:50:18 Its the first week of May and my coconut oil is still solid.

9921 2018-05-01 01:49:40 i dropped my toner two weeks ago and have already noticed a major improvement in my skin. obvs all skin is different but id highly recommend giving no toner a try (im really oily and acne prone btw and i dont produce as much oil now w/o toner !!)
9922 2018-05-01 01:49:30 I shaved everything and now I'm covered in coconut oil so u could say I'm having the best night

9924 2018-05-01 01:49:22 Paid $120 for an oil change and tire rotation today. Made me miss the Honda.
9925 2018-05-01 01:49:10 this is what one of my more decent hair days is like; any advice/ product recs are welcome bc i am NOT sure if i'm using/doing the best! currently will use apple cider vinegar & coconut oil treatments, mane n tale shampoo/conditioner, biosilk (when particularly dry feeling) …
9926 2018-05-01 01:48:52 coconut oil is the all around miracle remedy but it does take incorporating into a regime :/ but it works
9927 2018-05-01 01:48:34 what kind of car and also its normal to see a lil moisture on the oil cap.
9928 2018-05-01 01:48:23 Even as a hardcore Capitalist (or maybe BECAUSE of such) I consider MLM's a virulent plague that relies on conjuring all sorts of implied promises in their targets' minds whilst burying the disclaimers of those promises deep in the fine print. Modern-day snake oil.

9932 2018-05-01 01:47:23 Just had an amazing massage. Love getting naked, stretch out on a comfy table and get rubbed down with oil. My massage therapist is amazing!
9933 2018-05-01 01:47:18 yes, it does, because when you divert resources away from the R&D that is supposed to make you less dependent on oil revenues to fund massive social efforts, you end up at the mercy of commodity markets.
9934 2018-05-01 01:47:17 This life can be yours at the low, low price of some stale bread, a little oil, and like 15 minutes in the oven!!
9935 2018-05-01 01:47:13 Looked into this more & feel better knowing there is $350T in land and natural resources owned by US, $150T in oil & gas alone. BUT may not want to go there (selling off assets) & some fiscal restraint would help. I just hope we can grow our way out. Signs point that way to me.
9936 2018-05-01 01:46:53 You may have something there. On the other hand the Iranian regime may counter attack to deflect Iranian public opinion away from local troubles & civil unrest. I'm sure they're burning the midnight oil with Russia and Syria.
9937 2018-05-01 01:46:50 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
9938 2018-05-01 01:46:47 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!

A lot of calories actually, but you’ll be hungry. 3 of these only a day and you’ll be in ketosis pretty quickly. Drink lots of water.
9940 2018-05-01 01:46:43 dont you just love when you accidentally use acrylic on top of oil :´)
9941 2018-05-01 01:46:34 One more: Has anyone promised you that by assisting Russia (Putin) to defeat Clinton, and/or by repealing or negating the sanctions against Russia, specifically those sanctions related to Russian oil production, that you would be allowed to build a Trump Tower in Moscow?

9947 2018-05-01 01:46:06 Yes, exactly. She doesn't want to seek revenge, because she just wants to be a free individual. I don't know how you take a statement that is the literal antithesis of identity politics, and spin it into an argument in favor.

9951 2018-05-01 01:45:30 I love a good red sauce on my pasta, but I am seriously warming to using a nice, light pesto instead. With a little olive oil. Great for summer dinners.

9957 2018-05-01 01:44:53 i can assure you that Markham has read (and understands) the CLP, and knows a *lot* about oil&gas issues. equating his stories with an application for an NDP Comms job shows that you don't know much about the issue or have a one-sided view of it

9959 2018-05-01 01:44:35 These two go together like peanut butter and motor oil
9960 2018-05-01 01:44:17 Note: the BC Government’s new legislation, which imposes control on all heavy oil traversing any part of British Columbia, would also stop any Alberta oil from arriving at the coast to feed this imaginary refinery that some people would have us believe could be built.

9962 2018-05-01 01:43:57 Such a primitive and dangerous way to move oil. Laughable and sad at the same time.

Yes puppy teething toys, that’s a good idea actually.  I have some cannabis oil that’ll help with that too.  Don’t worry it doesn’t have THC in it.  THC is the psychoactive ingredient in weed.
9966 2018-05-01 01:43:29 The gas shed from the oil deposits would fire Turbine Generators for hundreds of years.

And they want to eliminate Israel.

9999 2018-05-01 01:39:24 i'd also recommend using a lot of what you normally use to shave (soap, shaving cream, coconut oil), and use more than usual the first few times you use the safety razor (i use kiss my face's, it's plastic packaging but i need moisture bc i have curly hair, prone to ingrowing).
