1 2018-06-17 23:45:50 Read Matt's tweet again. The way we arrange markets creates the inequality. Not differences between people. It's Malthusian thinking that the population can't support itself due to limited capital. Granaries are overflowing and commodities have never been so cheap despite tariffs
2 2018-06-17 23:34:40 Until we wake up to the fact that we are slaves & commodities to a system that’s built on our labour & controlled for the benefit of a few we will have no change. We are more powerful than you think & change is within our grasp but we must stop feeding the beast
3 2018-06-17 23:31:53 It is a business opp for many. Some arent mission driven and really dont care about children. They see Black/ Latino kids as commodities....which ultimately leads to exploitation. Certainly not all schools. Many leaders care, but without oversight you get exploitation #SOBTC

 The Facts prove you're wrong. If trade war was indeed on, these commodities would be up big time. Of course facts never matter to you anti- Trumpers
5 2018-06-17 23:30:03 Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
6 2018-06-17 23:27:49 And that's assuming they're actually their parents. Children are being trafficked as commodities. So how do we even know the children are safe with them? How?

9 2018-06-17 23:14:14 It's about money. The more people they gather up, the more money the for-profit immigration jails make. GOP is expanding it to include children jails. It's basically a form of slavery. Human beings as commodities.
10 2018-06-17 23:12:06 The children are being turned into commodities. IF Trump et al were so concerned about the 'burden' they say these children are, they would be returned to Mexico. Trump is trafficking children.
11 2018-06-17 23:11:02 one need look outside the u.s.  children of slaves were commodities to be bought and sold or killed. native children were stolen from their families -after the initial genocide and herding of people into camps. this most recent outrage is as 'murican as apple pie
12 2018-06-17 23:09:39 Eveybody who buys vatable commodities or services in Kenya is a tax payer!
13 2018-06-17 23:05:39 These kids are worth money to the Republicans. Why do you think we don’t know where the girls or infants are? It’s always about the money with them. They don’t see the immigrants as human as much as they see them as commodities.
14 2018-06-17 22:53:25 Its certainly a possibility.  We're only 4 cents off the 60s. UBS think the Aussie is going higher as a result of stronger commodities prices

40 2018-06-17 22:17:31 I get it but if u wanna check sentiment why not do a broad basket vs commodities and spy? Those r two kinda binary choices. All good man love ur posts was just being cheeky!
41 2018-06-17 22:17:17 Could not agree more.
The whole immigration thing is designed to force scarcity.
Driving up prices on commodities and real estate.
42 2018-06-17 22:11:32 Cryptoamb will surely buy lots of btc at 5000bucks I know. Btc and blockchain are the future while traditional commodities are the past
43 2018-06-17 22:06:10 Concordo. Commodities desacelerarão no final do ciclo. Como sempre. Mas temos ainda uns 100% pela frente nas commodities, antes do enfraquecimento. Commodities vão muito bem em períodos de rising inflation e interest rates, e muito mal em períodos de deflation e cortes de juros.
44 2018-06-17 21:41:55 Qual o limite do dólar? Vamos receber commodities em dólar e comprar com yuan ou Bitcoin, ou convidar os industriais chineses p se instalarem aqui...
45 2018-06-17 21:31:52 Falling prices should increase the purchasing power of wages. Artisan items become commodities

47 2018-06-17 21:24:32 Because we are producers of primary commodity. Don’t deluded yourself to think you’re Germany. You’re not. 

Most of Africa produce primary commodities like Nigeria, so Nigeria is technically one eyed among the blind.

51 2018-06-17 20:41:05 i probably say this every closed season but some fans (not just #SaintsFC) need reminding - players aren't simple commodities that can be bought and sold at the whim of the clubs (or fans). They actually have a say in the matter. Rightly so.
52 2018-06-17 20:32:43 7 Com isso, a economia internacional irá desaquecer, afetando negativamente a cotação das commodities.
53 2018-06-17 20:30:13 Folks feel great about capitalism when it comes to commodities but don’t realize its capitalism that keeps them from affording basic human rights like health insurance, clean water, housing, food.
54 2018-06-17 20:29:12 But when tariffs cause food, clothing and other commodities (sugar, coffee etc) to be more expensive to the consumer, then there aren’t many financial benefits of eu membership. Protectionism ALWAYS causes prices for the consumer to be artificially high!

57 2018-06-17 19:48:42 The trade spat between US and China appeared to hurt commodities and commodity currencies, with China threatening retaliatory tariffs on Friday.

59 2018-06-17 19:37:34 Can someone please tell me the economics behind the rise in prices of basic commodities and fuel currently happening here in Zimbabwe,petrol now as much as $1.49 from 1.36.
60 2018-06-17 19:14:42 @rickjnewman AND PRAY TELL ME WHO IS GOING TO TELL THE CONSUMER THE TRUTH WHY THE PRICE OF POP WENT UP 5 CENTS A TIN. OH, JUST A MINUTE SAYS PEPSI CORPORATION. IT WAS DUE TO THE RISE IN THE COST OF SUGAR, SWEETNER, WATER, I THINK IT IS ONE OF THOSE COMMODITIES. MR. FORD MOTORS,
61 2018-06-17 19:09:11 It is perfectly possible to explain international trade patterns based on the relative cheapness of foreign commodities, as David Ricardo and Adam Smith did. No need to refer to comparative advantage.
62 2018-06-17 19:06:17 W/E Wrap:
The US-China trade war is back on the front burner - White House confirmed 25% tariffs on a further $50b of goods, and China matching; equity and currency markets took it in stride, seeing only mild declines; commodities took the news harder, dropping like lead balloons
63 2018-06-17 18:58:55 My deepest sympathy to you. We must be vigilant about what is tolerated by other nations. The children have be dehumanized. Commodities in a twisted mind.
64 2018-06-17 18:48:34 Opposed to people always being self-employed, either individually as an independent contractor or jointly in a co-operative.

And I agree, nothing is more respectable than a hard working individual, which is why workers shouldn't be treated as rentable commodities.
65 2018-06-17 18:21:28 Eh, I gotta say something probably unpopular here. I've seen a lot of comments lately about makeup companies using food to describe darker makeup shades. I really don't think this is a racist thing. I even saw a comment saying they do it because these were valuable commodities...
66 2018-06-17 18:21:22 Both are same commodities with different packagings. God knows what the real commodity inside the other packet is & why they are being hidden completely
67 2018-06-17 18:14:16 Very good and powerful statement 
To para-phrase -
In this Union People are treated as disposable commodities to enrich the few
Independent Scotland provides a new canvas to value,respect,educate,train & invest in all our people
@YSINational
68 2018-06-17 18:10:31 A typical far left/right tactic on Twitter. Sanity, and rational argument, rare commodities.
69 2018-06-17 18:02:24 @a0Co it's the same thing once u understand candlestick u can trade anything .. forex , futures , stock, bond commodities , mutual funds
70 2018-06-17 17:52:33 A big move into commodities?
71 2018-06-17 17:48:06 When we begin talking about things like sugar is when we see action being taken.
How about other commodities that we are not/yet to talk about?
72 2018-06-17 17:45:47 Could we kindly stop naming brown and black foundations/concealers after food? It's kinda fucked that y'all barely make shades for dark skin and then name them after commodities like coffee and chocolate, esp when most those resources come from colonized nations. DisGOSting.

75 2018-06-17 17:31:46 This is in no doubt a mark of sinking sand relationship. Humanity is not defined by commodities but abilities to solving nonmonetary problems.
76 2018-06-17 17:21:52 Eg you say Oil is illiquid, that is somewhat true of underlying in some areas, but nobody trades the underlying - futures (derivative) oil market is massively liquid... like most commodities BTW
77 2018-06-17 17:17:12 CHINA COMMERCE MINISTRY SAYS CHINA TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL 25 PCT TARIFFS ON CHEMICALS, MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, ENERGY PRODUCTS AND COMMODITIES FROM U.S.
Китай вводит 25% пошлины на химию, мед.оборудование, энергетику и товары ширпотреба из США

82 2018-06-17 16:23:32 The children are viewed as trading chips in an open market...similar to the slave trade. Human commodities for exchange and negotiation. Our president reduces American morality down to chips on a table.
83 2018-06-17 16:18:40 Is there really a point in replying you? Truth and a healthy dose of reality are scarce commodities indeed
84 2018-06-17 16:05:30 The difference between them is their mentality. Additionally, S sudanese depend on foreign commodities .

86 2018-06-17 15:51:52 Es algo "obvio y normal" para 'commodities' como el petróleo y gas. Es un Recurso No Renovable que según proyecciones no durará mas allá de 2.050, por eso será cada vez más caro, tanto así que hay países que prohiben y prohibirán el uso de combustibles fósiles hasta 2.030
87 2018-06-17 15:51:27 I just saw... Jesus, this is nuts.

Someone said that the reason people compare darker skin colors to expensive things is that they are really thinking about buying black people, because commodities.

What the goddamn fuck.
88 2018-06-17 15:49:42 @realDonaldTrump 
If the law prohibited naked short selling of commodities, this criminalality would stop.
89 2018-06-17 15:26:11 So depressing to hear the #Labour leader claim immigrants drive down wages despite there being no evidence of that whatsoever & Labour MPs like Caroline Flint & John Mann talking about immigrants as though they're commodities rather than human beings - it's disgusting#Brexit
90 2018-06-17 15:25:32 Newest narrative that is meant to confuse right and wrong:
If people think all invasions (illegal immigration) are refugees (seeking asylum) then taxpayers can still afford paying for their commodities without having enough for their own families.
91 2018-06-17 15:19:02 Yes. But it's obviously a little more complicated than that in the 21st  century. Workers receive their livelihood from the private investment that is allocated by commodities trading. The distribution network, the grocery stores are another story entirely.
92 2018-06-17 15:16:48 Os 8 anos de Lula deveriam ser os melhores da história do Brasil... TODOS as commodities com preços nas alturas... Congresso sob controle. O que ele fez? Tentou se perpetuar no poder! Um erro atrás do outro!
93 2018-06-17 15:15:05 This nyaya of trying to coin a currency of sorts out of us is really disturbing. Women and girls are NOT commodities you can place a tag on. Pass us with the BS plz

95 2018-06-17 15:01:21 As for free market for those other Ag commodities, it doesnr exist. No other Ag sector operates on the free market. They are all subsidised. The subsidies just operate a little differently.
96 2018-06-17 15:00:00 65% of Americans are obese.  Tired of all the food drives. There are government commodities handed out monthly. WIC program for babies, food stamps.  Many churches have soup kitchens.  If people get hungry might inspire them to get s job.
97 2018-06-17 14:55:09 Last time when you referred Gundlach about commodity I said I have completely different line and said commodities won't go higher and will turned down sooner than later
98 2018-06-17 14:36:17 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.

104 2018-06-17 14:01:01 Maybe they will give the farmers that sack of monthly "commodities" that they want to replace SNAP with. Hey, maybe they will even get some of the wheat or corn that THEY grew!
105 2018-06-17 13:54:44 I get your point about Miller being a weirdo, and I agree, but some advice, don’t objectify women to make your point. Women are not commodities. It perpetuates the idea that we’re objects to be used as you wish. It’s really gross.
106 2018-06-17 13:53:10 Speaking from a general point. Sexual commodities rule every market.
107 2018-06-17 13:49:02 Ademas la economia es fundamentalmente dependiente de commodities y mucho se lo queda gente de fuera, la desigualdad es un problema
108 2018-06-17 13:39:53 Dad's are one of the two most important commodities needed in today's world  
109 2018-06-17 13:38:11 Time to stop trading in essential commodities like grains, pulses, spices, vegetables etc. it’s not only against indian ethics but also helps to control prices. Shut down commodity market.
110 2018-06-17 13:37:06 So in case u don't know how commodities work. #1 most crops are insured, maybe not at top $ but surely at more than bottom $. Otherwise people wouldn't plant bc commodities are very volatile. 1/?
111 2018-06-17 13:32:21 @ChrisGPackham Great Springwatch but please don't refer animals as 'things'. This culture needs to be changed. 'Things' means one can treat them like commodities. Plus, apes share 95% (or more) of our genes, are we 'things' as well?
112 2018-06-17 13:31:09 It's so much bigger...The wallet is at least everyone trading commodities + most macro funds.  In addition to custodial/mandate issues....There's the fear of being first.

115 2018-06-17 13:07:57 Потом особо одаренный идет читать, что показывает ВВП по ППС и обнаруживает, что он совсем малость не имеет смысла, как только речь заходиь о tradable goods, таких как автомобили, электроника, commodities.
116 2018-06-17 12:53:33 Nope..  It's the same as someone who decides to do more for humanity .. Comes to Africa and takes pictures of kids who are starving..  

Some will say our experiences are now commodities Etc but the person might just be throwing light on the issue.  
But we expect better..
117 2018-06-17 12:34:41 The wealth a father leave behind for his children R sometimes not in the form of commodities.

126 2018-06-17 11:22:11 Please can you educate me how this government is doing what you just stated in your reply because,

1. Nigeria has been poorer by NBS. 

2. Transparency International said Nigeria is more corrupt now. 

3. The prices of commodities are higher.

129 2018-06-17 10:51:54 What do you expect when local manufactured products are taxed high and the available commodities are cheap in the streets to unsuspecting people?
130 2018-06-17 10:48:00 Socialism, in the form of a society where the workplace is democratised and there is joint ownership of commodities. That's how I'd paraphrase it in any case. I'm sure others would describe it differently
131 2018-06-17 10:44:14 err...dont India need doctors and IT professionals ? exports should be of our excess produce not of scarce commodities !!
132 2018-06-17 10:42:31 @narendramodi 
Dear Prime Minister
Good Afternoon
People  of India are confused about your government performance Kindly send updates to clarify the activities of your government. Also please arrest rising petrol and Diesel prices  including prices of essential commodities.
133 2018-06-17 10:26:12 Common sense is one of the most unused commodities available to man.
134 2018-06-17 10:24:03 Not only the money grabbing lawyers but maybe headline grabbing "press" could realise that you, Billie, the cubs and now Lilah are not commodities but real human beings with feelings to you all 
135 2018-06-17 10:21:09 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
136 2018-06-17 10:13:52 We know you guys don't consume such commodities. You're only trying to endear yourself to electorates now that a re-run is looming
137 2018-06-17 10:10:10 lukewarm(미적지근한) : The deal seemed lukewarm to the commodities trader. 상품교역자에게 그 거래가 마음이 내키지 않는 것으로 보였다.

143 2018-06-17 08:44:31 I didn't say I was or I wasn't against the sex industry. I think it's complex and has it's foundations in women being seen as commodities that can be purchased by men. I am more interested in debating why so many men are comfortable with treating women with such contempt
144 2018-06-17 08:27:20 Kenya bourgeoisies/thieves; grab school land for the poor children, grab playing grounds meant for the children of the poor citizens, import commodities and overprice them & in the process kill the struggling local industries, etc. How do they want Kenyans to live? Crazy!
145 2018-06-17 08:25:31 Nigerians are top commodities

147 2018-06-17 08:20:55 I will insist and keep on repeating this... 
The day Kenyan thieves(political class) will start interfering with simple things like basic commodities (they have started with sugar) that is the day pseudo middle class will rise up against relathieves... till then "shida iko wapi?"
148 2018-06-17 08:11:05 State antitrust laws applicable to corporations but not to individuals, or to vendors of commodities but not to vendors of labor, have been upheld.
149 2018-06-17 08:10:05 Crypto tokenization is unique, because the smart utility of some of these currencies can be used to trade commodities at a faster pace.

153 2018-06-17 06:15:41 Big lie. Does June 12 restore 20M jobs ? Does it put food on the table? Does it generate power or provide employment to teeming millions of unemployed youth ? Does GCFR bring down the ever soaring prices of essential commodities ? Shame on you for taking us for fools

156 2018-06-17 05:45:53 Donald Trump was threatening India earlier this week for the negotiation on Trade Deficits. He imposed tariffs on some Indian Products. 
For the first time ever in history, India retaliates to USA by increasing Import Duty on more than 30 Commodities which gets imported from USA.
157 2018-06-17 05:28:20 Hoping our leader would think and act like a father to the nation.  Lead with sincerity for the Filipinos' welfare and the endless rising prices of all basic commodities, utilities and services.  A father who is willing to defend the sovereignty of our territories.

160 2018-06-17 05:16:10 Caretakers should not be allowed to change commodities prices.
161 2018-06-17 04:59:01 So I have this running theory about the dark shades being food (and often wood) because things like (brown) sugar, cocoa, tea, chocolate, mahogany, ebony etc were all highly valuable commodities extracted through colonialism.
162 2018-06-17 04:43:21 Social capital is one of the most undervalued commodities on the market. It'll 1000x when shtf....
163 2018-06-17 04:30:35 @jordanbpeterson : In evolutionary biology sex is the most prized commodity of all, and when excluded from prized commodities biological entities tend to become agitated.

@jordanbpeterson followers: That smart guy is justifying my anger at women and I will absolutely gofundhim.
164 2018-06-17 04:11:48 Awww. Its not a competition thing.  Its a united thing against GM commodities. Glad Japan is vigilant.
165 2018-06-17 03:44:01 It seems to me that you are ascribing some inherent value to money itself, which it definitionally does not have. Inflation predominantly hurts people with very little money. The rich easily buy into other commodities, the poor find their meager savings diminished further.
166 2018-06-17 03:33:10 In capitalism commodities must be priced for optimal profit, not optimal consumption. The "correct" price for food is not a price that allows everyone to eat, it is a price that forces some to overpay while others must simply starve or steal. Crops are destroyed to keep prices up
167 2018-06-17 03:03:57 As for the import from China, Chinese usually do it the following way. One Chinese-american build up an American company CA, one Chinese governor build up a Chinese company CB. CA as an agent and Chinese-market expertise consultant looks for demand of commodities. Then the demand
168 2018-06-17 02:59:31 "Despite a decade of lackluster returns and bubbling trade tensions, the "strategic case" for buying commodities from crude to copper has "rarely been stronger," analysts for the New York-based bank said in a note Tuesday." @IANMCGUGAN May 1, 2018; @globeandmail @GoldmanSachs.
169 2018-06-17 02:52:59 no all studies that examine actual processes of price formation for specific commodities show that supply & demand determine between 20-30% of most prices, except in very specific contexts like stock markets or street fairs. Labor markets probably even less than 20%.
170 2018-06-17 02:47:50 I mostly agree with you.. but you always miss a glaring category which are crypto commodities, such as ETH (not a currency - @cburniske does a good job explaining why). 

L1 protocol tokens will power all of these security tokens, execute contract calls to pay dividends etc.
171 2018-06-17 02:16:06 If they made gluten free ones,  I might keep a couple. I wish they would go back to commodities, the was some good food there
172 2018-06-17 02:14:20 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world. #tpesa
173 2018-06-17 02:12:50 Trump put tariffs on Chinese goods that you buy. That means you will pay more if you wish to purchase them. You may buy comparable U.S. goods if they are available. If not available, you will pay more. There are many commodities the U.S. cannot produce. You will pay more for them
174 2018-06-17 02:12:02 @BolSoberano / El bolivar soberano debe nacer anclado al commodities ORO de lo contrario es un aborto nace muerto.
175 2018-06-17 02:11:15 It must rule to think of the absolute basics of human dignity and decency as services and commodities, as opposed to fundamental rights. How grown up these brutes must feel.
176 2018-06-17 01:55:32 What happens to China's economy is the same as what will happen to the American economy. American-produced sorghum and soybeans will no longer be sold in what was the largest market for American producers of these commodities. There are no winners in a trade war.
177 2018-06-17 01:55:05 De las actividades que suman valor agregado a la soja, la mejor es el aceite de soja con el 22% de VA. Claramente la mayor parte de la industria ofrece mayor rentabilidad que eso, sin contar que seguís atado al precio de los commodities que no determina precisamente el Estado
178 2018-06-17 01:45:23 Commodities e VALE começam a entrar em terreno perigoso, dada a força do dolar no mundo inteiro....commodities tem correlação inversa com o dolar...minha tese é que commodities podem entrar numa perna forte de baixa a qualquer momento e ai a VALE fica pendurada no dolar x real
179 2018-06-17 01:40:36 Funny you should mention tariffs and the wall in the same tweet,  @Prez45Sux1 

What's stopping us from using the proceeds from tariffs on Mexican goods and commodities to fund the wall?
180 2018-06-17 01:39:11 Está cheia de defeitos a comparação. Mas, os preços das commodities se comunicam. Sobe preço do oil, vai pro diesel, e esparrama no custo de produção de quase tudo. E comm move o Brasil. Sem commodities, o país não tem renda pra nada.

A olho nu vc percebe a semelhança.
181 2018-06-17 01:31:56 commodities. Because you are commodity yourself. For example, you are the representative of the government to purchase a commodity A. The manufacturer Mr ask for 10000 RMB yuan. You bargain for 6000. Mr then ask for 9000. You answer for 70000. Then Mr refuse to accept your offer.
182 2018-06-17 01:29:00 Gold is not welded and inseperable to commodities. We've been living under the illusion that it is for 100 years b/c of gold standards of yesteryear. Plus I never advocated a standard. I said gold could do the job that the UST bond does today. Nothing else
183 2018-06-17 01:19:20 La devaluación, indefectiblemente te va a llevar a solucionar el déficit comercial, y dado que con medio dolar te comprás el país (TC $30), turismo, textiles y comercio en el interior (por ingreso de commodities a tipo de cambio actual) sin dudas repuntarán.
184 2018-06-17 01:06:47 Players are treated as commodities not partners
185 2018-06-17 01:05:14 A vast amount of the children forced across the border don’t belong to the “people” bringing them in. They’re props/commodities/sex toys to be sold post entry. The best way to find out is to separate them, place them in a safe environment and let them be honest without fear.
186 2018-06-17 00:49:41 Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I like ladies I can chat to, that are nice, kind and caring, dying commodities sadly. Men can change very quickly, who you thought was a good bloke, can often turn out to be a right git!
187 2018-06-17 00:40:18 Ya te lo dije pero no lees!!!! Entró una montaña de plata, nunca entró tanta plata por la exportación de commodities en la historia argentina. La usaron para ganar elecciones y no para desarrollar el país. Si vos estás bajo los efectos de un encantamiento, es otro tema
188 2018-06-17 00:39:40 El déficit significa eso,pero la pregunta es para que se genera.Claramente no eslo mismo una situación de alza en los commodities que una crisis internacional. Noes lo mismo el gasto enaviones usados de guerra queen educación y, sobre todo, no es lo mismo la falta de $ que de U$S
189 2018-06-17 00:36:48 And this all goes without mentioning the suffering of animals whose bodies are directly used as commodities. Or the disproportionately marginalized people who work in animal agriculture, and the trauma they experience from carrying out this violence.
190 2018-06-17 00:29:11 What you are proposing would require a situation with minimal liquidity inside the financial markets to curb speculation. If gold were to move aggressively upwards in price in all currencies, speculators would reflexively bid up the price of many commodities,imploding the economy
191 2018-06-17 00:04:54 The cool thing about Queer Eye is that its' LGBT credibility lets you pretend you aren't participating in a reality tv culture that is actively rotting your brain and conditioning you to see human interaction as a transactional exchange of commodities.
192 2018-06-17 00:01:46 Life is a Gift that Comes from God. You can never afford a child. Placing the child on the measuring scale of commodities and earthly riches is profane. A child is always a Gift. A neighbor's son was the result of rape. His mother courageously gave him a chance. God sent him.
193 2018-06-16 23:53:34 By the looks of them I would expect that most of these would be relatively low dollar volume compared to petroleum products, automobiles, soy beans or corn, for example. Looking at it by top dollar volume commodities would seem to make the most sense.
194 2018-06-16 23:23:26 Unfortunately in Brazil, the devastation of rainforests and other forests around the country for more land to grow commodities are responsible for this tragedy!!
195 2018-06-16 23:20:06 IOW I totally agree gold is a small part now...but for it to settle commodity-related trade imbalances (the kind EU, China & Japan mostly have), gold must be made much bigger relative to commodities.  Both EUR & CNY Currency systems are structured to be “pro-gold” in this way

241 2018-06-16 18:45:54 We live in a religious environment where people are simply making a living off being religious. They have turned the sacraments into commodities and preach about a Jesus that brings them a life of prosperity and happiness. That's not Jesus.

This was spirit of Eid in medieval India- rape of girls on festival day.
268 2018-06-16 16:43:12 Marx delved into commodities as a material analysis. Because you have to. As per classes of humans and things like alienation. He was specifically quoting Hegel and non-material dialectic. So just in terms of Marx you are wrong.

284 2018-06-16 15:19:19 Republicans would not have ever existed but for their radical idea that some humans aren’t commodities. Those against slavery of man or of state are naturally disinclined to pledge their complete and total loyalty to the Democratic Party. Why would they?
285 2018-06-16 15:16:53 And you should be thankful the Democratic Party doesn’t still want people of color in chains, sold as commodities (something the Republican Party does not and has never advocated)... stay with your slave masters if you must, or think for yourself for once.
286 2018-06-16 15:13:48 Each parable (usually) only tries to make 1 point. So it deletes everything that is not required to make that point?

Naw thats you bud.... Marx wrote about the commodity & social relations therein.
298 2018-06-16 14:11:29 Not costs. There are $ incentives for removing children, keeping them in the system, adopting them out/bonus if they are disabled. CPS runs as a business using children (including those being taken at the border) as commodities.

305 2018-06-16 13:05:19 Prime Minister of India visiting other countries is welcome. But on the other hand increasing oil prices every other day, resulting in sky rocketing of prices of essential commodities is bothersome. Giving meager fitment of 15% to PSU employees is another jolt on country's growth
306 2018-06-16 13:01:13 I wonder how many who today are outrageous of how children are separated from the parent/parents in US today is still up in arms of having children being ordered and sold as commodities from poor people to rich people in the west known as surrogcay.

308 2018-06-16 12:58:46 Not to pick on @MacRoweNick, but I'm always curious about the economic validity of parables (which usually make single points) for productions contexts, where produced/traded commodities far outnumber the amount of producers, and where there's also trade is in intermediate goods?
309 2018-06-16 12:53:53 we need to examine our real beliefs about women and their babies.  we are not commodities.  we are not on this earth to be used to further other peoples' agendas agendas. we are not for profit, not for sale.

319 2018-06-16 11:43:03 I also know and I've been there, I know all the tips and tricks to avoid them. It's especially worse for black women, Arab men see us as cheap and readily available commodities.

335 2018-06-16 09:36:22 Firstly ,great work . Secondly , Luck has been on governments side with prices of commodities being at multi year lows ( except for this year ).This might get tested with commodities again rising,the cost vs revenue equation might get tested.

It's almost always for the purpose of causing harm to one or all parties. Occasionally necessary but ~2000 kids in a few weeks smells like commodities trading.
343 2018-06-16 08:58:22 Also, while we`re concentrating on ABC - they want the States to Privatise HEALTH Services - so they can compete - using sick people as their "Commodities" in their "Stocks`n`Shares" Game of the rich - some ALP Response would be good - Now. xx
344 2018-06-16 08:56:43 If u care about the future of kids u should uphold #democracy uphold #brexit results. UK will thrive outside of EU but still trade with EU.

347 2018-06-16 08:26:53 Plus imposing a blockade under the pretext of stopping the smugling of weapons while you are essentially stopping basic commodities and collapsing the economy is illegal and immoral. We #Arabs have said this for decades about #Gaza and did the same in #Yemen when given a chance.
348 2018-06-16 08:23:46 The week ended with significant slides across commodities: Friday fall:

What would you put in ICPI?

Does each fiat stabilize against this overall or do they each independently construct subsets of commodities tailored to productivity/resources?

373 2018-06-16 04:18:08 My dear, just read the news everyday. Our economy, just like any other market system is susceptible to the volatility of commodities being traded, particularly oil.

Also, as our currency is floated it is always impacted by the strength of the dollar - being a global currency.
374 2018-06-16 03:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
375 2018-06-16 03:34:58 Man, if he actually said that, it's a new low, even for him. Our neighbors to the south, and those living inside our borders, documented or undocumented, are not commodities to be shipped like an order from @amazon.
376 2018-06-16 03:23:39 We need to see the medical drugs and commodities lists. Which partners are following up on that and can they share so that we understand the actual need?

380 2018-06-16 03:16:54 I'm w/ Tom on that one. Trouble ahead. Bullish consensus not in line w/ actual strenght. Surge of expense in Q2 due to high commodities prices but also reversal of the book cooking of 17Q4.
Also, bad cycles.
Keep the good work, Tom!
381 2018-06-16 03:14:08 With enough MONEY you don’t have to bother unlocking closed doors, you can just create new doors and pathways to the commodities.  ABUNDANCE for the masses will not create “Inflation.” #tpesa
382 2018-06-16 02:56:59 What a dangerously half baked thought bubble of cultural vandalism! If private enterprise can bugger up the privatisation of simple commodities like gas and electricity, Christ knows what they’ll do to something as precious and fragile as Australian storytelling and culture

You’re better off just staying in the STL.

You could purchase their commodities.
388 2018-06-16 01:23:21 Eventually, people will shortcut and just start exchanging commodities/items for unintended tokens (most likely the one that is most liquid, likely the energy one). Over time, the entire economy will re-converge to that one token, & we'd have made a full 360 returning to 'money'.

His knowledge of the oil industry is elementary and nothing more than someone standing at petrol station with their finger in the air. Speaking about commodities is best left to pros.

402 2018-06-16 00:30:28 I personally like the volatility.  Remeber we produce commodities of which there is a finite supply at any given point. People overreacting. Fundamentals are the same this week.  ABCD will ship soybeans and corn very readily from US to wherever the supply deficit is.

404 2018-06-16 00:17:07 Today's nightmare thought:

Significant recessions cycle through about every 10-12 years since the 1930's. 

Trump is kicking off a trade war that may skyrocket prices of commodities and products across the board.

The great recessions started ten years ago in 2008.
405 2018-06-15 23:59:51 The problems started years ago when someone in a suit , like your wearing started to take advantage of agriculture. That’s when the farmer began taking less for commodities. To pay bills,  produce more for less to survive and pay bills.

447 2018-06-15 20:40:47 I suspect that the reason they didn't get girls when they were younger is because they saw us as commodities then, too. It doesnt help that that's how women are portrayed in so many popular video games.

466 2018-06-15 19:23:27 All commodities have crap prices right now here. Theres not much money to be made on anything. A quick Google search reveals the average price per gallon of milk in Canada is around $6 American dollars compared to $3.50 here. How's that good for your consumers?

489 2018-06-15 18:38:30 And I repeat an earlier question . Why should other commodities have to pay tariffs in other countries so SM can be protected? Yes we need good negotiators who obtain value...and every country is guilty of protecting some sector.

536 2018-06-15 16:16:01 Which market cycle phase do you think we are in?  I am having trouble pinning it down.  Late expansion incoming I believe.. but not all the signals are correct.  Commodities should be going up, not down.
537 2018-06-15 16:14:41 imagine being part of a big hedge fund or investment trust and trying to sell clients on the value of commodities like ether and bitcoin. you can’t really say what there value is. nobody knows. it’s all just speculative.
538 2018-06-15 16:11:24 Last two days have been rough in commodities lots of over reactions IMHO. Times like this I try not to do much, keep my emotions in check, and stick to original plan. People get wrecked when they over react when markets over react, recipe for disaster.

You sell collectibles, not commodities. Baseball cards, coins, toys, civil war memorabilia; they all have boom/bust cycles dictated by consumers who give collectibles value. Commodities have value as they are resources.

599 2018-06-15 13:21:54 My dad, who used to be a the plant manager of a MNC that manufactures basic commodities is siding with NutriAsia  So frustrating.
600 2018-06-15 13:16:56 Yes to this, but men, maybe please cease and desist with the "as a father of daughters" thing. It's an extension of the myth that women are commodities that need to be protected. Surely working with your client has shown you that we are perfectly able to walk in our own power.
601 2018-06-15 13:13:17 Don Roberto,  "el problema" es de organización, crear un producto entre varios actores, exportar al mundo más que frutas y commodities, deben reunirse en un mismo taller diseñadores, ing, maestros, artesanos y grandes vendedores para exportar al mundo.
602 2018-06-15 13:08:43 #Tariffs. Commodities not liking tariffs.  Soybeans and wheat off 2%, copper off 1.5% and gold down 1%. C$ and A$ not doing well.
603 2018-06-15 13:04:40 Still glad we got president Jimmy Carter to help us with commodities
604 2018-06-15 13:03:35 Wait in 2 years and see what happens. The Federal Reserve just increased interest rates, gas prices going higher, prices of commodities going up. What will those tariffs do to consumers? Who’s going to harvest those agricultural crops?
605 2018-06-15 13:01:23 Commodity bulls who are looking to the CAD and AUD as proxies have to be scratching their heads.  These commodity currencies are imploding vs the USD.  Commodities and USD can move together in the same direction.
606 2018-06-15 12:56:27 Why does inflation never seem to affect the price of labor even when the price of commodities are rising?
607 2018-06-15 12:55:08 Peoples don't drink petrol you talk about inflation dal sugar oil necessary commodities price have come down
608 2018-06-15 12:55:03 Seems I finally got a handle on these commodities trade, but we'll see...
609 2018-06-15 12:51:35 We have a lot of people who go to rural areas buying maize, tobacco, gold, they are side-marketing these commodities hence misusi cash-Mukupe #Asakhe

612 2018-06-15 12:43:01 I agree with you about getting visibility on non oil export but if we get over $1bn export from you why not import at least a quarter of that amount either oil or other stuff commodities from us!

616 2018-06-15 12:28:40 Eu nem tenho ilusões, Brasil virou periferia da periferia no futebol, mero exportador de commodities, e esse esquema vai continuar pq tem muita gente ganhando com ele
617 2018-06-15 12:23:55 AP News reported President Trump approved roughly $50 billion of new tariffs on China, a move that is expected to result in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans. The June U.S. dollar index is quietly lower and nearly all commodities R lower, thx @ToddHultman1
618 2018-06-15 12:13:41 @JujuLaBelle here is some bits on #RwandaBudget18 :
(1) taxes cuts on primary   commodities saw - sugar, rice -  will  allow families to spend less on food. Thus, spending on other products. This will increase the  country's GDP.

619 2018-06-15 12:10:50 All out war. Trade, currency, commodities and food....
620 2018-06-15 12:04:30 The neo-liberal Nakasone once disputed marxism in that it treated people as economic commodities instead of as people. A bit hypocritical. But Labour's immigration policies have been tougher than the Tories since losing Smethwick. Media rhetoric would have you believe otherwise.
621 2018-06-15 11:56:53 In the US : ICOs are potentially falling within three regulatory buckets : the SEC (as tokens may be securities, the CTFC (as tokens may be commodities) and FinCEN and the Bank Secrecy Act (as tokens may be money)
622 2018-06-15 11:45:24 Top of that mismanagement list would be creating a dependency on foreign investment.  I do believe Venzuela is known for having one or two tradeable commodities of its own to play with.
623 2018-06-15 11:44:47 Not quite 10 yrs ago when the banks were blowing up and commodities were rocking I sent weekly price charts of base metals with YouTube rock song links. Good Golly Miss Molly (moly). Like that....
624 2018-06-15 11:44:14 I always wonder what's the rationale of destroying contraband stuff instead of even giving out to needy guys, specially when the commodities are for basic needs
625 2018-06-15 11:40:55 We dont want the higher input costs from commodities to prevent us from investing back in our brands. #FridayFeeling
626 2018-06-15 11:28:10 Wishing him happy birthday. But Annaji is man of RSS. Not a singel time raise objections against this government. No lokpal. Very high price of essential commodities and petroleum product. Poor education. Poor health service. Unemployment. Corruption of Bjp leaders.
627 2018-06-15 11:17:21 Mate. Women are not commodities that are selling themselves
628 2018-06-15 11:16:10 Nunca se sabe.
Pero si producís commodities tenés que pensar en dólares. Una devaluación solo significa que los fletes y algunos costos te bajan por un tiempito. El fertilizante, químicos y semilla, no. Alquiler, tampoco.
629 2018-06-15 11:15:53 Granted, but prices can't stay high forever just on commodities markets' sentiment about 'supply-side reforms'. If output is growing, then demand must be playing along, or else how are prices supported for quarters on row? Theses are not short-term price spikes, are they?
630 2018-06-15 11:14:02 She voted remain? But yes I retweeted the tweet to her that migrants are not commodities they are human being, or something to that effect. But I do understand her sentiment not her analogy.
631 2018-06-15 11:11:30 My Business Mentor said not to engage with @CobaltWorld 
Said He is not an expert in Commodities or Minerology.
Opinioned He had no expertise worthwhile to engage with..
632 2018-06-15 10:59:23 Preston, are securities and shares the only asset classes that are traded speculatively and respond to positive news? Imagine the price impacts of positive regulatory announcements on various commodities.
633 2018-06-15 10:52:21 Yeah the single tweet taken in isolation is misleading, The campaign is to not fund orphanages etc who treat children as commodities. It's about giving children a better chance than being stuffed in an institution and forgotten about.
634 2018-06-15 10:19:29 Oro cae al igual que el petróleo, commodities agrícolas y el Bitcoin. Sube el cobre.
635 2018-06-15 10:18:41 Dólar se deprecia ante euro, libra, yen, corona danesa, peso mexicano y rand sudafricano. Se fortalece ante las commodities currencies, corona noruega, sueca, rublo ruso y lira turca.

637 2018-06-15 10:14:03 They shouldn’t need to compromise, homes shouldn’t be allowed to be traded as commodities or investments.
638 2018-06-15 10:12:47 I don't know what's wrong with ex post judgements.... Doesn't hindsight matter?

To take one NIEO possibility... Clearly global commodity price regulation is clearly 'technically' feasible. It was even attempted in several non-oil commodities.

641 2018-06-15 09:52:02 Up of course. Commodities are always accumulated during uncertain times. The coins that are recognized as a commodity, like etherium, will be a store of value.  We are entering a time where return OF investment is more important than return ON investment.
642 2018-06-15 09:43:40 Yes he is worth the stress. If there is an enabling environment, business can be done and profit enjoyed. But, who enjoys profits today wen prices of commodities have sky rocketed?

645 2018-06-15 09:39:20 There's a washout going on in the net long commodities due to dollar index rising now. Catalyst was this week.  Don't see why this won't accelerate into next week.  We could see a $50+ drop in gold next week.  That would make these $0.70 into $30.....  I like the risk/reward.
646 2018-06-15 09:29:20 Unfortunately most consumers don't care about self-sufficiency. Why would they when global sourcing is normal for all commodities these days. We're flogging a dead horse if we want public support on this front.
647 2018-06-15 09:28:17 I dont really care about women in combat. But if I see a tomato anything I fucking flip. It actually really gets to me. Medieval European settings, even fantasy ones, bother me when they unrealistically portray commodities and other logistical problems.
648 2018-06-15 09:21:38 Why? Here's my guess.  Robert Kagan, Arne Duncan, Alan Simpson, Larry Summers, Victoria Nuland, Tim Geithner, Ben Bernanke, Gramm-Leach-Billy, Commodities Futures modernization act,  Welfare reform, racist broken windows policing, 96 crime bill,  union busting trade deals etc.

650 2018-06-15 09:04:41 Congress if it returns all the looted money and scammed resources inflation will be controlled. All commodities will be cheap then. Please put in some shakti on this path too.
651 2018-06-15 09:02:08 youve missed the point entirely.... when ideas are commodities and the money is stolen before you can use it then you are a caged animal in someone elses exhibit

655 2018-06-15 08:42:49 The US is still probably the greatest country in the world when you look at ease of access to commodities, both personal and corporate, and maybe tertiary education. But in any other metric I can think of, I wouldn't even put them in my top 3.

657 2018-06-15 08:31:42 In today's India most people; politicians, bankers, journalists, businessmen are purchasable commodities. It was not like this a few decades back.
658 2018-06-15 08:31:02 VAT on basic items is set to go up in coming months through amendments to the Tax Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2018 that has reclassified a number of basic commodities from zero-rating for VAT to exempt status.

661 2018-06-15 08:04:17 Gold and silver have had a good rally since the Fed rate hike and if we get a sell-off in equities. Dow Futures sharply lower currently - commodities such as the previous metals will benefit as asset class shifts.

...Maybe we’ll stop “insulting” your manhood then. 
713 2018-06-15 03:56:44 Thats just the standard medium term cycle in oil and petrol prices. Prices rise>supply goes up v demand>prices fall>supply falls v demand>prices rise. Would be nice if it were stable - but all mkts work that way (esp commodities)
714 2018-06-15 03:46:56 How long will it take for the common person to realize that the people that run every thing don't care about them. We are only commodities to these people.
715 2018-06-15 03:31:24 El gobierno anterior de cfk qué dejo el país en la ruina, lo agarro cambiemos y se confiaron qué iba a resolverse así de fácil. Medidas erróneas inexpertas y hasta sorpresivas. Desde el 2008 hasta hoy no hay avances. Y antes fue por los commodities, la realidad Argentina
716 2018-06-15 03:28:58 So much for that extra 100 in your pocket. Are you so blind between gas and commodities you’ve lost more then the 100 you gained. And PS when you have a heart attack from that slave job of yours don’t walk into any hospital looking for care without insurance.
717 2018-06-15 03:25:16 Germans took greater interests in our culture and history(translation of Vedas and archeological studies) while British were only interested in commodities and labour.
718 2018-06-15 03:22:19 That statement makes me a top fourth Ag marketer lol. We need to find the guy that plans money flow of commodities and make him president next time.

721 2018-06-15 03:14:58 Am sure Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i is capable of dealing with all criminals, cartels and tenderpreneur who are killing innocent Kenyans by selling poisonous commodities.
722 2018-06-15 03:07:51 Who cares? It’s pure politics and political oneupmanship!  Citizens like soldiers are expandable commodities for these politicians! They neither understand government nor governance! This is proved by their actions over years.
723 2018-06-15 02:57:20 No fue merito económico del kirchnerismo el precio de la soja y otros commodities o productos básicos los fijan mercados internacionales x ej Chicago.
724 2018-06-15 02:44:18 Anybody who listens to Bloomberg knew the moment that JCPOA died, commodities breathed new life and a mad scramble for hard currency ensued. It isn’t hard to see how a country with an energy mix like Jamaica would be affected by what’s been going on w/w. READ PEOPLE! READ!

729 2018-06-15 02:21:53 Chile, subido al tren de la economia mundial y a la mejora de precios de commodities esta creciendo sin hacer nada, nuevo, al 4.5%.  Macri debe terminar el 10/12/2019. Ni un dia antes (se quiere rajar). Ni un dia despues (jamas la reeleccion)

Joey: A little bigger
Monica prepares to cut a bigger piece
Joey: Little bigger.
Monica moves the knife again
Joey: What? Are you afraid you’re gonna run out? Cut me a real piece!
Ross: So what are you up to?
Will: I'm a commodities broker.
Ross: Really? #Friends
732 2018-06-15 02:06:21 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.

734 2018-06-15 01:56:36 You freakin Democrats couldn’t make a deal on a Yugo! Drugs and child trafficking commodities are all you are good at. How about a denial or a rebuttal? Waters and Pelosi used to much of that product and are now as dumb as a box of rocks! Billy’s I didn’t inhale was funny!

739 2018-06-15 01:24:15 All this talk of deviding California into 3 States is depressing to this Bay area native. I think I'd rather see us become or own nation! We could export cannabis and hemp along with our produce and other commodities. Use our 9 billion dollar surplus to become independent. 
740 2018-06-15 01:16:45 cada vez mais o ser humano tratado como coisa... daqui um tempo vão usar aborto como instrumento de controle de commodities, assim como quando queimaram café pra regular o preço.
741 2018-06-15 01:13:28 Bigger issue to me is he should not have tried to speed up the rebuild, that approach can work but there's a smaller margin for error because you have to give up multiple assets for known commodities...hopefully GMJB takes a more patient approach and builds through the draft
742 2018-06-15 00:51:51 Aunque una economía basada en el turismo es una trampa :p

Si, tenemos para ser potencia agricola, ahora, tambien es necesario pasar de las commodities a producir, el salto a la tercer revolucion industrial y a ser potencia regional educativa para la eventual cuarta rev es imp

744 2018-06-15 00:43:15 Time is one of the most valuable commodities.
745 2018-06-15 00:33:05 We tax savings and investment because those are excesses that over half of Americans don’t have.  Better to tax that than money people use to buy essential commodities like food or housing.
746 2018-06-15 00:24:58 4 AM ...that's when the mouth pieces get their talking points ... they are bought and sold like commodities  ... Peace
747 2018-06-15 00:13:25 Oil and gold are not securities - they are physical commodities. Cryptos are digital commodities
