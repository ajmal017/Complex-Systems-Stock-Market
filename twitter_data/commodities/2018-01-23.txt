68 2018-01-23 20:32:24 What “store of value” loses 50% of it’s value within a month? Currencies, money, commodities are all SoV. They are all pretty stable SoVs. Bitcoin was imagined as currency, but it lost it’s utility due Core neglect. Now it is bad SoV as much as it’s unusable as currency.

75 2018-01-23 20:00:29 To be precise what you're talking about there is gold. Canada is the 5th biggest gold producer in the world. But the importance of commodities to Canada's trade does mean it's not a great point of comparison with the UK.
76 2018-01-23 19:49:09 Some interesting coverage of #commodities in today's AFR. Are we on the cusp of a significant boom?  The price of commodities compared to the S&P 500 is at historic lows, not seen since the early 1970's and late 1990's.  Time to invest?

99 2018-01-23 17:17:10 Cartelling principally is wrong, also considered ‘unfair’ trade practice in our competition Act. However, execution of the Act weak & ridiculous. Trade in some commodities should be controlled by govt. it may fix prices for access& welfare reasons, to regulate or to subsidize.
100 2018-01-23 17:11:42 The monthly RSI is clearly insanely high, but price structure/action in other world markets (such as Russia, China, Italy) bode for broad global equity upside this year. Further, commodities haven't even broken up and away yet. Yours truly, only longs.
101 2018-01-23 17:11:28 Why brag that you are so weak in empathy & character, as to choose gluttony over morality, in the torture of #Sentient beings, labeled commodities, under the Laws of Supply & Demand, to be bred, subjugated, tortured, isolated, abused, misused & slaughtered for profit and/or fun?
102 2018-01-23 17:00:05 True...Its not about "You" OR what you eat, per se. Meat eaters  deliberately deflect from the real debate. #veganism is about respecting & speaking out about the sentience of beings who are a minority voice. Sentient beings are not commodities under the Law of Supply & Demand.

110 2018-01-23 16:34:01 Overproduction literally isn't the problem, indeed. Many commodities are underproduced on purpose, It is capital's (driven by class society) own dynamic to destroy the relationship between environment and society

154 2018-01-23 13:50:32 No Govt can ensure it..This MSP mechanism has inherent demand-supply anomalies built in which lead to multiple problems including ironically both scarcity & over supply of agro commodities simultaneously..this problem can't be solved without agriculture being declared an industry
155 2018-01-23 13:50:10 You do realise that “wives” are human beings. Don’t you? Because it seems that you talk about women as though they were commodities. Men are buying women in exchange for cattle and the problem here is that 30% of men have problems accessing this market. Wow!  @UNWomenWatch

160 2018-01-23 13:16:11 This is where objective tariffs & quotas come in.

261 2018-01-23 06:12:10 From my understanding of Economics, "Essential Commodities" are suppose to be surplus, equitable in distribution and available at fair and affordable price. I wondered if the government is doing anything to invoke the act of PMS hoarder and black marketers in these country
262 2018-01-23 06:11:05 Oops... All industrial commodities suddenly go helicopter!!

264 2018-01-23 05:54:59 Industrial and energy commodities means? I see coal and crude is mentioned here. Other examples?
265 2018-01-23 05:48:02 You have no idea why crude has been going up, do you? Also, the fact that China is building world's largest Airport may see demand in metal & allied commodities. Remember the olympics that China had hosted & how it had resulted in commodities rallying?
266 2018-01-23 05:38:36 Opinions are the cheapest commodities in the world.
267 2018-01-23 05:38:28 Before 2007, China was taking just about anything that they could squeeze out a few molecules of commodities
268 2018-01-23 05:15:17 any how, price will shoot up, whether it is bought under GST or not. Prices of essential commodities have skyrocketed after bringing them into GST, contrary to what Modi said.

280 2018-01-23 04:01:16 no ED on Gasoline. It should be under GST at 5% slab, this will control the inflation in the essential commodities.
281 2018-01-23 03:59:49 Fuel prices increasing day by day - thus increasing prices of all commodities. Ministers and MP/MLA enjoying their life from the payment of common man ( from our tax)..no one seems to be bothered about this price increase...billionaires and so called 'leaders' are not affected..

289 2018-01-23 03:25:12 यह इसलिए कि तब की सरकार राज्यों को उनका शेयर नहीं देना चाह रही थी। इस वजह से GST लटका रहा। बीजेपी ने उन सभी बातों को तुरंत मान लिया और इसे लागू कर दिया। और साथ ही सभी राज्य सरकारें भी सहमत हो गयी। भाई साहब, सभी वस्तुओं पर GST 28% नहीं हैं।आप सभी Commodities को एक कैसे मान सकते है

297 2018-01-23 02:36:18 Commodities are the opium of the people.
298 2018-01-23 02:32:25 While chairing at the Presidential Palace meeting in Khartoum today, I instructed authorities to break up monopoly of commodities, control prices, and monitor the markets on a daily basis to ensure that our fine citizens can easily get basic goods!
299 2018-01-23 02:31:43 Pernia: any increase in prices for basic commodities will not be good; fuel price hike brought about by Tax reform will be transitory, will eventually peter out, but OPEC- induced hikes harder to predict @ANCALERTS

303 2018-01-23 02:19:07 I think people just want simple solutions instead of realizing they need to raise their own kids and pets better. People don't want to fight for animal rights. Lots of people see pets as commodities and just don't understand how to care for them and they deserve love

309 2018-01-23 01:35:19 I agree Ronnie.  In a world of autocracy and quantitative easing where the central banks around the world destroy value, I think precious metals, bitcoin, and commodities are the only way to hedge.  In a system of debt, one of the two parties, is always the slave.
310 2018-01-23 01:30:41 Why do people want to try to reflate a bubble when the real money's to be made in the commodities/stories that haven't run yet.

311 2018-01-23 01:29:40 You still have to have adequate inventory of BTC to dump on the markets to make that work.  It’s quite different than other commodities they ccontol or can easily accumulate

313 2018-01-23 01:20:33 Hey Shawn! - Since futures are cash settled, the only way for BTC price to go up or down is for futures players to actually hold BTC and manipulate the market. Is that is true, then one makes money by milking commodities up and down, not just down...

319 2018-01-23 00:17:20 I've theorized many times, it's a matter of businesses accepting less profits as once one company raises prices another will steal their market.

322 2018-01-23 00:04:28 Solyndra was trying to produce interesting, but unproven, new technology - which, had it proven economical, would have reduced solar installation employment.

The new tariffs are on standard solar panels, which are well-known commodities at this point.
323 2018-01-23 00:00:48 Re: solar tariffs. Imagine if they put a tariff on oil and the price of gas at the pump went up. How would you feel? Solar cells are an energy commodity. Yes, they are manufactured but America wants low cost on energy commodities that don't need refueling. Tariffs r a bad idea.
