First as a snake oil cure all [Medical] but the goal was to sell it OPENLY 2anyone. I don't see hashish far behind & then other drugs
162 2018-01-26 23:34:41 Look we all know Trump is a buddy of the oil & gas industry. He's not going to help their competitors.

166 2018-01-26 23:32:52 Feels eerily familiar to MLPs and oilfield servicers during oil rally. Even E&Ps didn’t appreciate much.
167 2018-01-26 23:32:46 Looking at the photo I can almost smell it. A mix of wood preservative and machine oil.

170 2018-01-26 23:32:32 you go to get an oil change and they tell you your car needs to be replaced
171 2018-01-26 23:32:21 like, all the shit I read about coal/oil power plants just makes them look horribly inefficient and polluting compared to literally anything else. sure nuclear fuel has waste that can like, mess up a small plot of land for a few centuries. but coal/oil fucks up loooootsa shit
172 2018-01-26 23:32:12 Well I was impressed till I read the article. Big oil man.
173 2018-01-26 23:31:58 Sad thing is I’m in the Environmental field. Believe me , we all don’t think like this and I also work for an Oil and Gas Company. That automatically puts me out to pasture with these goof balls. I’ve actually been called a traitor before by tree huggers...
174 2018-01-26 23:31:56 Copaiba can help soothe anxious feelings and it can be applied to the skin to promote a clear, smooth complexion.  You can apply topically combined with a carrier oil or a facial moisturizer.
175 2018-01-26 23:31:51 The Republicans did that decades ago when they elected Dubya and all went out and bought Hummers. Another win for big oil.
We shouldn’t forget.
176 2018-01-26 23:31:39 C*CO shit did the big mistake in there life , did not they know that when u add  oil on fire that make it  more dangerous 
Now Army r furious and I'm one of them let's show them the real artist #iHeartAwards #BestBoyBand #BTS @BTS_twt

181 2018-01-26 23:30:29 Begin your new week with Elevation, the perfect blend of invigorating essential oils that can elevate your mood and increase your energy. Diffuse this oil, or place a few drops on your wrists to promote a revitalizing environment.
182 2018-01-26 23:30:09 What tripe - modernity as we know it could not survive without fossil fuel. Not one person attending would give up their jets, their heat or hot food, which be absent without oil.
183 2018-01-26 23:30:07 Oil paintings, apparently? And I'm like dude I work in an art gallery where we have a few famous artists and even their originals range from like $1000-5000 for the most part. The most expensive piece we ever had was $8500 and it was a giant mosaic.
184 2018-01-26 23:29:39 oil and coal probably paid trump

187 2018-01-26 23:29:29 How do you use coconut oil as a moisturizer? Like does it not clog you’re pores & cause breakouts ? Okay maybe it’s just me...
188 2018-01-26 23:29:28 Yes, that was my point in the initial thread. Even if you get the MWh from solar or wind, still need gas and oil to firm. Instead, let's use hydro to firm (if nuclear is off table) and add wind & solar on top of that. That was the gist of the whole Mass RFP really.
189 2018-01-26 23:29:28 hey yall so theres peppermint oil in my eye and im losing my shit so goodnight
190 2018-01-26 23:29:10 Daaamn I thought looking for buds was hard haha, tengo años looking for an oil cartridge

192 2018-01-26 23:29:09 んごー
193 2018-01-26 23:29:00 Yes it is. Her candidacy provided an opportunity for their to be a candid discussion around the millions of dollars the Bachmanns made with this snake oil abuse of vulnerable teens and others. Conversion therapy should be illegal.
194 2018-01-26 23:28:56 i was bitching to calvin about how i feel like shit & just want to go home but still had to take my car to get an oil change & deposit my paychecks & this man really offered to trade me vehicles & do it all for me.. who is this angel & how'd i get so lucky 
195 2018-01-26 23:28:42 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
196 2018-01-26 23:28:42 Olive oil does bits for ur skin negl
197 2018-01-26 23:28:40 Yeah true ,  as long as the profits from Public Land use go back to the People ..This has not been the case for too long now ...Oil found on Public Lands , for instance . Who profits ?

199 2018-01-26 23:28:18 I understand where you're coming from but my original point was that Arsenal can moan all they like about money but they're owners just won't invest like City's do. Therefore, I believe they're conning their fans. Also their owners made their money from oil.

203 2018-01-26 23:27:06 Guy went home today because he was depressed grow the fuck up and get out the oil field pussy
204 2018-01-26 23:27:05 I need to buy some coconut oil...I been slipping on correctly moisturizing my skin.
205 2018-01-26 23:27:00 おはよおはよぅーー
206 2018-01-26 23:26:56 Is there a possibility that he’s doing this to allow oil and gas companies to begin fracking or running pipeline’s.
207 2018-01-26 23:26:31 I just told my boyfriend to tell @Osrs_Tronse that I want to rub him up and down with baby oil
208 2018-01-26 23:26:13 Except for the oil derrick at the beach.
209 2018-01-26 23:26:09 おはちゅうるい
210 2018-01-26 23:25:54 Nice cartoon but  ISIS  part is wrong.  Usa  created ISIS  and now wants to carry the  raqqa oil to the east mediterranean via PKK terrorists in Afrin.
211 2018-01-26 23:25:52 99% of Americans could care less about Kazakstan unless oil, er... people needed liberation. Yeah, because FREEDOM!
212 2018-01-26 23:25:39 If oil makes you wet then how is it not wet
213 2018-01-26 23:25:36 Ok but squalane oil has the most wonderful feel to it, like some sort of liquid cashmere, it’s impossible to explain
214 2018-01-26 23:25:29 The Mercers have funded "climate denial" groups in order to protect the fossil fuel industry's pollution-causing extraction of oil and gas.
215 2018-01-26 23:25:18 Wow...found an oil change spot that closes at 5 a.m. Super clutch!
216 2018-01-26 23:25:17 ...wait did they make a soup using oil instead of water? D: ewwwww
217 2018-01-26 23:25:15 Hi #Montreal folks with dual-energy heating systems. Is it normal that the light for the oil heat isn't shutting off, even though it's not below -12?

#concernedsomethingiswrong
218 2018-01-26 23:25:14 20 million barrels (42gal) of oil a day is what we use.  LOTS OF ACRES no matter how fast it grows!
219 2018-01-26 23:24:53 B. And people like her and her radical religious flock. They want that $$$ and they rake it in. Money will not open those pearly gates for these snake oil salesmen.
220 2018-01-26 23:24:50 2 We are losing $bn that will not be available for health, infrastructures etc...
-meanwhile the US oil sector in ND, MT is booming
Alberta lost its attractiveness. Adding tax to the current depressed economy corresponds to a poor allocation of capital: It won’t grow the cake 
221 2018-01-26 23:24:47 mfs be so slick til they fall in their own oil spill. s
222 2018-01-26 23:24:45 Make sure you oil your hand first
223 2018-01-26 23:24:42 1-2MMbl excess production for 2 years - should have 800MMbl+ stocks Adding: Oil on water +OCED +China +KSA +Other OPEC. Inventories are lower than they were in 2014. 900MMbl vanished!! DEMAND, 1/2 of the equation. Crude will be $10 higher in 3-4 weeks.
224 2018-01-26 23:24:38 First he used tariffs to try and kill the solar power industry (even though it employs more Americans than coal and oil combined) now he just straight-up wants to make it easier to pollute with impunity.

Trump seems determined to turn America into a toxic sewer.
225 2018-01-26 23:24:35 And now the present admin is making same mistake with the past admin using getting out of recession as a basis that people are getting rich,using foreign reserves which by the way rose because of oil price increase,as human capital development
226 2018-01-26 23:24:16  could you imagine Wenger haggling over buying a car....oil would run out before he made a deal.

231 2018-01-26 23:24:00 He had the treasury print money. That’s as much as anyone has opposed the Fed.  He also hated the CIA,  was gonna take away the oil depletion allowance, talked about secret societies...
232 2018-01-26 23:23:56 And palm oil
233 2018-01-26 23:23:49 おはおはよ〜〜
234 2018-01-26 23:23:47 Apple cider vinegar is so good for you!! But yeah the taste is something special  Two Rivers Olive Oil Company in Beaver has some excellent flavor options, such as peach and white raspberry, and they are all sweetened naturally!
235 2018-01-26 23:23:46 Oil up!
236 2018-01-26 23:23:30 1. There is no justification for public deficits anywhere in . Only one country in the world can afford this privilege.    
-Alberta oil barrel is sold with a ~20% rebate through the US
-infrastructures are a bottleneck and there is no coherent vision in the country
237 2018-01-26 23:23:29 おはぽん
238 2018-01-26 23:23:19 PS Norway loads of oil and a tiny population, you are seriously deluded
239 2018-01-26 23:23:16 i think there's a couple ways you can look at it (or pick n mix) that make sense. one is that, for instance, a car "eats" oil but if you "hurt" a car it will also leak oil. another is that maybe for cybertronian biology energon is like water to earth organisms ->
240 2018-01-26 23:22:59 Isn’t it amazing how many good people get fooled when a snake oil salesman puts on a suit and tie. Obama is about to experience a different United States.
241 2018-01-26 23:22:58 Texas is one of the biggest employers of illegals with fake docs. The oil fields are full of them.
242 2018-01-26 23:22:47 Let me go to the end point: it does not matter: oil lost cannot be compensated for when production and pipelines go back to normal.
243 2018-01-26 23:22:45 Big Oil lies almost as much as Big Green.
244 2018-01-26 23:22:35 Trumps wants to use dirty energy like oil to destroy the oceans it’s more then time to use clean energy no more oil drilling in the pristine waters !
245 2018-01-26 23:22:33 New testament in bible disagrees  who throws the first stone ? A us soldiers who bombed and shot Iraqis to give them a better life aka selling oil to west and purchasing western  products and allowing western  inports
246 2018-01-26 23:22:26 Certainly not a product which allegedly contains palm oil....
247 2018-01-26 23:22:25 This came only 3 hours after China announced the “Artic Silk Road”.  We still need Chapter 19 in #NAFTA and much more.  China can process Tar Sands Oil.
248 2018-01-26 23:22:18 It's good to know that people come to me to get connects for good oil and bud , but when I don't even get "how's it going?" " thanks bro appreciate it" too many times it's happened , it really is heartbreaking ....
249 2018-01-26 23:21:37 おはよおはよぅ
250 2018-01-26 23:21:30 @megadave5000 do you trade or look at oil at all? I walk in, open my screens, and watch it go up everyday. It’s tiring to watch, even on things I don’t have a position on in.

259 2018-01-26 23:19:54 The YPG are not terrorists, they beat Daesh and saved the Yazidi from complete genocide, Turkey purchased oil from Daesh, stolen from Mosul and Raqqa, done nothing for the Yazidis and now are funding the FSA who is known to have been infiltrated by extremist jihadists.

289 2018-01-26 23:16:33 Oil?!
290 2018-01-26 23:16:33 This is a reminder, get your oil changed.
291 2018-01-26 23:16:29 My internal reaction was like that scene in Futurama where Leela sees a wave of oil coming for her and she just sighs as she zips up her parka for cover.
292 2018-01-26 23:16:15 the climate solutions caucus are both corrupt and climate change deniers. you introduced legislation to reverse the finding that carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases are a danger to human health and the environment. exactly how much does the oil industry pay you??
293 2018-01-26 23:16:10 Is the State of Washington waging war on traditional energy sources like coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear energy in favor of "green" energy which hasn't proven complete sustainability

  Check this out. 
Went to Valvoline Oil Change in Redondo Beach and It was exactly like you said stayed in my truck doing business calls while being serviced. I was in and out in less then 15 minutes. No BS & 15% off for being a Veteran. Thanks

300 2018-01-26 23:15:00 Yup, he lived off the Venezuelan oil money and his father helped prop up Chavez to help destroy the Venezuelan economy. Brought people to where they eat their pets. Poorly done. Should hang their heads in shame.

303 2018-01-26 23:14:15 So glad I had a boy. My son changed the oil in my truck today while I was at work. Now I don’t have to spend my Saturday at the garage auto shop place. 
304 2018-01-26 23:14:05 There are no magic wands to economic downturns triggered by constant drop in commodity prices, every nation must live through it. Your country since they discovered oil made it its sole Forex earner and mainstay of the economy.
Only those on Twitter have the magic wand.

306 2018-01-26 23:13:32 True, they wouldn't be much without Chick-fil-A sauce, but the fact that they actually take the time to hand-bread/season their chicken then fry it in peanut oil (not canola) really makes me trust the quality and origin of their chicken.

311 2018-01-26 23:12:37 Haven’t tried it yet but holy shit it looks and smells amazing. I used rosemary and olive oil Triscuits on cod.

313 2018-01-26 23:12:34 Wishing oil a great weekend!
314 2018-01-26 23:12:30 You can make any robot into a healthier option with low fat oil, but the taste isn't as perfect
315 2018-01-26 23:12:08 No they hve not; they are only respected when there's money from oil Revenue to be shared with Ottawa and the rest of Canada.
316 2018-01-26 23:11:26 They're a huge source of a lot of bad. Like Palm Oil and bottled water.
317 2018-01-26 23:11:15 Today I managed to get a haircut, change my license, change my social security card, get an oil change, and clean the inside and outside of my car. Now I’m poor and tired, but I feel accomplished.
318 2018-01-26 23:11:11 Rancid nuts, 37 servings of rare prime rib, Bordeaux reduction, and proprietary Mirage Hotel and Casino massage oil. #ConceptualLunchable
319 2018-01-26 23:11:11 (...dealer buys tea tree oil)
320 2018-01-26 23:11:07 So I think next time I'm going to bring my car in for an oil change I'm just going to remove the sticker that says I should've done it four months ago...
321 2018-01-26 23:10:33 WOW !  Schooling should teach people about where food comes from and how it's obtained.  It's very sad to think most dont care.  Palm oil in soooo many products.  maybe some will rethink what they are buying - if they are aware.  RT !
322 2018-01-26 23:10:29 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
323 2018-01-26 23:10:28 I get it but there is a risk w/ Cain on a long term deal. That said, I'd take him on my team for what Milwaukee signed him at.

325 2018-01-26 23:10:22 Are you going to be first in line with the coconut oil?
326 2018-01-26 23:10:17 We poor oil down drains now ?  This is why I clean the kitchen.
327 2018-01-26 23:10:17 Put the extra pesto in a glass jar and refrigerate it.. dont forget to add some olive oil on the top (for the color). It works!
328 2018-01-26 23:10:16 @POTUS approved the Keystone XL pipeline and exposed tribal lands to oil leaking into their water table. THEN quietly the pipeline was rerouted away from the sensitive Sand Hills, protecting tribal lands, and at a cost to Keystone of $150m. Trump's record for mine is back to 100%
329 2018-01-26 23:09:22 Shell Zydeco crude #oil pipeline to begin maintenance activities later next week, expected to last 30-45 days #OOTT
330 2018-01-26 23:09:21 Put my lights up and even changed the oil in my lamp..

337 2018-01-26 23:08:12 I was confusing Coconut water and Coconut oil.   Oil is all fat....water is all carbs???
338 2018-01-26 23:08:08 Girl, nobody trying to take oil down. I would have suggested taking a trip to T&T but I know you Caribbeans don't have passports. That isn't what our oil down looks like
339 2018-01-26 23:07:33 Than why doesn’t USA stop stealing oil from Iraq and Syria?
340 2018-01-26 23:07:26 And change the record guys!!All this oil bullcrap is getting soooooooo boring!!!

343 2018-01-26 23:07:06 No at 120 dollar oil we could not balance a budget under the cons....not even during the boom!
344 2018-01-26 23:06:56 I hate when chicks have a cigarette sitting in they mouth like a mechanic. Lookin like you wanna change my oil
345 2018-01-26 23:06:43 The only reason I want a girl is so I can get her to put oil in my hair for me 
346 2018-01-26 23:06:19 y'all use coconut oil and rosewater for EVERYTHING
347 2018-01-26 23:06:11 Their father got his start by helping Stalin set up his oil production.  When elder Koch saw how Stalin treated people that Koch worked with, he went into right-wing land. SAD...

349 2018-01-26 23:05:51 There's no oil in this land. We only have art
350 2018-01-26 23:05:50 Lots of laundered money, lots of shell accounts, lots of Russian money funding groups which oppose our domestic oil and gas production. Russia especially concerned about our LNG exports to Europe.
351 2018-01-26 23:05:47 The sunflower oil from Babi Cosmetics!! 
352 2018-01-26 23:05:39 The Afang soup ingredients includes afang leaf,waterleaf,periwinkle,stock fish,dry fish,palm oil,Pomo,meat and every other thing one wants.

354 2018-01-26 23:05:16 That only happen when you mix water with hot oil...
355 2018-01-26 23:05:13 All of that for palm oil filled crap..
356 2018-01-26 23:05:12 Just woke up from a nap where I was explaining to my mom the benefits of using 3:1 ratio of CBD to THC vape oil vs. as needed benzodiazepines to help with anxiety.
357 2018-01-26 23:05:09 I heard from a well placed source that the slide is due to a secret attempt on the part of Big Oil to prop up trump.
358 2018-01-26 23:05:05 Do you tip the people that do your oil?
359 2018-01-26 23:05:03 I should get my oil changed more often... the men here are so nice

369 2018-01-26 23:03:33 I hear ya.  This time you can't reflate an economy 10 years onto expansion for much longer and peak oil has been debunked.   I wish I'd have shorted it today.
370 2018-01-26 23:03:19 Stupid oil company called me at work
Claimed credit card no good
Wouldn't go through

373 2018-01-26 23:03:11 People are too ignorant. They don’t understand how much is created out of the oil and gas industry. It’s not just so we can fuel cars, but roads, plastic, energy. Almost everything around us is created from this massive industry.
374 2018-01-26 23:03:05 The name oil down CANNOT be associated with that kind of....... someone dial 911
375 2018-01-26 23:03:04 People who aren’t acne prone tweet about skincare like this:

2) tap olive oil into your face

380 2018-01-26 23:02:29 Is that an essential oil of pine, or some other version of pine isolate?
381 2018-01-26 23:02:24 Have you tried the yesto lip oil

383 2018-01-26 23:02:08 Here, they were the ultra-cheap car for sale, so least likely to be kept to the maintenance schedule (so gas, oil, and the rest is only a concern if it breaks).

My area doesn't even understand winter road-salting, so they didn't rust.  They just died.  Haven't seen one in years.
384 2018-01-26 23:02:03 sometimes i think about the fact that the giant offshore accommodation barges for oil workers etc is called a “floatel” and feel an immense surge of inner peace
385 2018-01-26 23:01:56 shea moisture jamaican black castor oil mask!! it’s my fav. or u could always use a mix of oils u have at home (my fav is almond oil+ castor oil + olive oil)
386 2018-01-26 23:01:47 It wasnt too hard to notice I was talking about vzla on my last tw. However, sanctions on Cuba or Venezuela means shit cause we deal mostly with China and Rusia. US still buys our oil tho, and Cuba still gets US turists.

I dreamt I ate Nutella after seeing it trend. Haven't had it in years because it's loaded w/Palm Oil from our depleted Rain forests & it's use is driving Orangutans to extinction. 
Am I guilty?
392 2018-01-26 23:00:28 Sinong ginagawa nang perfume yung efficascent oil dahil sobrang sakit ng katawan niya mula Jan 24?

393 2018-01-26 23:00:13 Improving drilling/fracking tech ensures we will NEVER run out of oil. That's the problem.
394 2018-01-26 23:00:13 People are preaching to the choir instead of doing something like taking out nation wide info ads, town talk forums.  Premier of Sask couldn't do it himself. Put some money up, you lazy, Whiny oil companies.
395 2018-01-26 23:00:02 I ain't a female lol but I know coconut oil makes your hair grow really fast
396 2018-01-26 22:59:52 Fyi - if you walk into a car shop wearing a coffee-stained shirt they will assume its oil and that your car exploded
397 2018-01-26 22:59:40 I shoulda bought ear pods when I was at the Apple store so I can watch YouTube while waiting for my oil change.
398 2018-01-26 22:59:36 Yo, it means either your brake pads are worn or your oil needs replacing. The number corresponds to how long the brake pads (or whatever) have left. You can find out the issue in your car’s internal computer. Same with BMWs 
399 2018-01-26 22:59:32 The oil producers don't seem to get that, either.

403 2018-01-26 22:59:03 Russia and Saudi Arabia are such great company.  Weren’t we supposed to run out of oil?
404 2018-01-26 22:58:40 Yeah sure just stay the hell away from Canada’s oil and it is our oil in the Arctic!
405 2018-01-26 22:58:40 And be seriously thinking, planning for, and understanding what will gainfully employ future workers (once properly educated/trained). Surely the ones that come home with oil and coal stained Carharts will grow weary of their daily berating by their robot homeowners.

420 2018-01-26 22:55:56 Think about the run from oil 60-100.  It was on unprecedented oil supply (Bakken, etc) but super weak dollar.  I think we are there.  U are on it with fundamentals being off, the market is treating oil as a reflation component.  Reflation = down dollar, up oil. Ends soon.
421 2018-01-26 22:55:48 My dog ate a whole bunch of blue ass oil paint... an alarming deep blue oil paint lol
422 2018-01-26 22:55:41 Say what?!?! 10 different strains on special? Buy an 1/8 or more its 20% off. Not to mention, We got lots of new oil to choose from!

424 2018-01-26 22:55:31 Nothing at Arsenal has changed but what has besides City is LFC & THFC. They have better coaches, now subsequently better teams & without the oil ££ Ppl like u like 2 use as an excuse. Cup competitions do not conceal the fact that as potential title challengers we R going nowhere

427 2018-01-26 22:55:18 Oh, what a fantastic copy-paste propaganda, did you wrote all that by yourself big boy? Lived there all my life, theres no such thing as sanctions and foreign efforts to destablize, if anything foreign nations did the opposite, Chavez paid enough oil for that.
428 2018-01-26 22:55:14 No kidding, if the wealth was just because oil, there are a lot of countries that would be wealthier.. The high IQ is the bigger factor.
429 2018-01-26 22:54:57 Nothing like that feeling right after you get an oil change. 
430 2018-01-26 22:54:51 But only in CA, we like oil here in NC.

455 2018-01-26 22:51:08 Not a coincidence that northern Syria is rich with oil fields. This is the 2nd stage of Erdogan's plan for the return of Ottoman.

457 2018-01-26 22:51:03 Wars for oil and drugs aren’t as profitable at home
458 2018-01-26 22:50:42 My hopes on Modi ji's govt. are dashed. Reasons_ 1) promises to AP unfulfilled
2) oil not included in GET not a balancing find created to absorb the robbery of OPEC.
3) law & order is bad.
4) focus appears to be only on elections, not good governance
5) cow brigade undid modi
459 2018-01-26 22:50:40 1) that hasn’t happened yet, and isn’t likely to happen anytime soon (it ever); 2) CO has much more stringent state oil/gas regs that Utah; and 3) none of those things have anything to do with CO trying to “repatriate” public lands from the federal government.
460 2018-01-26 22:50:33 Avec l'augmentation de la CSG non compensée pour les retraités, l'augmentation du gaz, du gas oil de l'essence etc vous êtes des fumistes
461 2018-01-26 22:50:06 I don't give a shit what a Kansas governor said. What does that have to do with me? By that logic drinking vegetable oil out the bottle doesn't make you fat? Wtf r you talking about.  Sure, if you eat ice cream in moderation it doesn't make you fat, but that's true for everything
462 2018-01-26 22:50:04 Disappointing year for sure, but I agree last year was an overachieving one, and when you combine that with the lack of dominant teams in the Pacific pre-season the Oil were as much the "process of elimination" favourite as they were a clear favourite.
463 2018-01-26 22:49:58 i need to get some deodorant and hair oil, but I’m too fuckin lazy to physical get out of my bed #cananyonerelate ?

465 2018-01-26 22:49:42 What is about the oil money?? We invest in our community and the people around the stadium.Dont see much of that going on around Old Trafford!
466 2018-01-26 22:49:36 I made bruschetta with all ingredients from Trader Joe's and I could live the rest of my life on that stuff.  Or become vegetarian.  Organic tomatoes, rustic baguette, greek olive oil, artisanal balsamic vinegar and ricotta cheese.  You won't regret it.
467 2018-01-26 22:49:32 My friend is racist! So I told this girl that I will marry a white man nd have beautiful white kids nd bitch started laughing that she can't imagine a white di** in her, that she feels it will melt into oil. Who says stuffs like that to another human.

473 2018-01-26 22:48:35 Thanks for your answer, however the article I read in the Financial Post said that they would no longer be carrying oil and concentrating on other products. They did not discuss CN.
474 2018-01-26 22:48:32 Obviously BS , but makes as much sense as much of leftist world view of reality.
475 2018-01-26 22:48:21 The one and only bumper sticker I ever had "Obama", got scraped off by the place where I had my oil changed. I didn't notice right away because it was small in my back window. Needless to say I haven't returned.

Soros - After Gulf oil rig fire went to Brazil to buy stock in THEIR Oil Companies, and 2 months later Obama went there and GAVE Brazil 2 BILLION Taxpayer Dollars for Oil Exploration.
THAT Soros?
BTW  Was THAT a THREAT on Trumps life?...

Create swapable battery racks instead, this whole waiting around for the car to charge is just sooo rubbish! Can you imagine the world today if each petrol car had to wait 30 mins for fuel to be converted from crude oil??
482 2018-01-26 22:47:48 Snake oil Hayes won't like that idea.
483 2018-01-26 22:47:31 Did he celebrate oil prices going up or talked about what to do with the excess unlike your N(hero)
484 2018-01-26 22:47:22 Actually, looking at a chart of the euro makes me think it's done going up.  Yen is too strong too.  I would have shorted oil today had I kept a better eye on that

491 2018-01-26 22:46:12 2016 was weak due to a plunge in investment related to fracking when oil prices weakened.

501 2018-01-26 22:44:43 Roooobbb!! Great to hear from you! I was thinking more of PAM or other weirdness. Olive oil is a totally okay, and that you use it just validates what we kinda all knew, that you're an awesome person after all. YAY!! :)
502 2018-01-26 22:44:41 I will say this. The best Publix sub order is white bread (ONLY time in life this is ok), a thin later of mayo, chicken tenders, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, banana peppers and a LITTLE bit of jalapenos, drizzled in honey mustard and a quick touch of oil.

509 2018-01-26 22:43:50 I've been trying to short It too, but I can't catch a vibe from it with Trump and Mnuchin talking about dollar policy.  I think the euro will dictate this one.  It tops out, dollar bottoms and oil tanks to 50
510 2018-01-26 22:43:39 Looks like high oil prices might have had an effect on that rather large crash in savings 2013-15.  Future price spikes could be even more difficult to bear for US households as MC/WC wages keep falling behind.
511 2018-01-26 22:43:27 Religion and ideology are both about power; ability to show power rests on the ability to control land/people/resources (hence #ISIL land grab, #China sea claim); resources (#oil fields, sell oil> income, power machines). Land/resources> War winner> controls more land/resources.

516 2018-01-26 22:43:09 Zero emission vehicles?? thats an oxymoron..how much energy (emissions equivalent including  coal oil & gas) is expended to process steel lithium aluminum cobalt nickel REEs plastics etc etc etc to produce ONE electric car..then to recharge after travelling 50km?? ZEVs r a scam.

524 2018-01-26 22:41:44 That is true. I used the Sesame oil, after Nancy advised me to try it. It browns better and the Aroma is Amazing. Kitchen smells lovely.
525 2018-01-26 22:41:43 If oil wasso effective, you wouldn't be seeing so many tinds all around. 
It's more of a genetic problem and can be controlled (to some extent) through proper diet.
526 2018-01-26 22:41:27 Try a little Vitamin E oil...works on my huge bald head.

537 2018-01-26 22:40:07 It's a game. In mid 1980s, there was an international oil trader for Gulf named Roger Rawstron & he would get visibly upset in the office when he discovered that some of his favorite, trusted counter parties were "bluffing" him re their oil market availabilities and requirements.

576 2018-01-26 22:33:32 I live in FL. Just returned from Cuba where a tour guide told us that Cuba doesn't use the oil it can drill offshore because the grade of the oil is not good enough for refining into gasoline. Begs the question: "Is any of our offshore oil the type we really need?"

Frump just likes to brag about himself & lie while he is at it.  The world knows better.  I don't know how he shows his face in public -lie lie lie
595 2018-01-26 22:30:18 Oh yes! We have just discovered the magic that is cuticle oil and it's amazing for the winter time! #BlendingHour
596 2018-01-26 22:30:17 I've been avoiding this oil change for like 3 days because I don't want to hang out at nissan of bowie 
597 2018-01-26 22:30:16 @jamieoliver watching 30 minute meals and @Martintaroni89 and I have jokey bets on the amount and frequency of your use of olive oil. You love it, Jamie!
598 2018-01-26 22:30:15 @BourqREAL In the wake of the conclusion of the Lac-Mégantic trial we'd love to know if you still think railways are safer than pipelines for moving crude? You commissioned the study using only statistics from Class 1 roads only, conveniently excluding MM&A's oil train tragedy.
599 2018-01-26 22:30:00 some churches just always look for ways to swindle their members in order to earn more profit. Imagine a church smwhre in Ketu selling a branded oil with the name of the pastor on it. This is to say, the pastor is the producer of the "miraculous" oil. Only God knows
600 2018-01-26 22:29:56 Did ya know the Canadian Goverment also subsidizes our oil industry? 

Not much different.
601 2018-01-26 22:29:32 Niggas at south be revving their shit  and acting so hard like their cars are the best but i bet you dont even know how to do an oil change..
602 2018-01-26 22:29:29 @RealMichaelKay @DonLagreca @Rosenbergradio Michael, how are you gonna be allergic to mayo? It’s oil, egg yolk, vinegar, and lemon juice...plus seasoning. You ate the second most popular burger in America, not rat poison.
603 2018-01-26 22:29:23 Shoot the market in the back short. Oil will soon run out of steam and if we get a few weak data points, the market will start thinking tax reform was no magic.  We get a 20% correction this year.  From where, who knows.
604 2018-01-26 22:29:19 you ain’t said nothing slick to a can of oil 
605 2018-01-26 22:29:16 Badger oil. Its like sperm oil. Only different..
606 2018-01-26 22:29:14 I used to hate them, too; but enough oil, salt, pepper and garlic def make them bearable.
607 2018-01-26 22:28:55 im finally getting my oil changed :')

611 2018-01-26 22:27:49 @RealMichaelKay @Rosenbergradio mayo is eggs, oil and vinegar or lemon juice that’s why nobody was worried you were allergic. #TellYourStoryWalking
612 2018-01-26 22:27:47 I don’t ever want to know the backstory on this photo though. I just hope that’s oil of cloves in his hand with his juice box. Toothache as well? FUUCCKK
613 2018-01-26 22:27:44 What? Badger oil? I don’t own I badger. I know one though
614 2018-01-26 22:27:24 No one knows what an oil defibrillator is
615 2018-01-26 22:27:02 Hibiclens liquid, shea butter, lemon juice for dark marks and witch hazel mixed together. Then hot towel treatment twice a week after using vitamin e oil
616 2018-01-26 22:26:59 Ana you can get cbd hemp oil products legally in all 50 states. I’m testing out a few brands and tweeting about it. You’d have to still check with your doc. Mine says it won’t show on drug test and they don’t consider it an issue b/c it’s legal
617 2018-01-26 22:26:57 He's gone with the zebra oil. Its a black or white decision..

625 2018-01-26 22:26:02 I hate getting my oil changed. They try and tell you everything is wrong with your car whole charging you 70 bucks for oil
626 2018-01-26 22:25:57 How is giving expired medicine and knives to the palestinians defending its borders from terrorists? They have no business in Syria other than of course buying oil from ISIS and treating their fighters in your hospitals.
627 2018-01-26 22:25:39 New life scenario: moisturize until I'm a veritable oil slick.
628 2018-01-26 22:25:37 I srsly went for a oil change to the dealership and they convinced me to get another car lol
629 2018-01-26 22:24:53 i would say leave out the coconut and avocado and use grapeseed and argan instead. OR use maracuja oil. It probably would be perfect for you. It's fine, I'm accustomed to questions.. lol!
630 2018-01-26 22:24:45 For the longest time I thought "essential oils" were so-called because they were considered essential for your health. And I remember thinking "I think I'll be okay without lavender oil in my life."
631 2018-01-26 22:24:44 I don't hate Pep spending all that money....I mean if I look in pockets and see an extra 100$ bill ima Prolly blow on shit I don't need too....Pep just looks in his pocket and sees a bottomless oil well of $...#ProllydoSame
632 2018-01-26 22:24:37 Had a friend recently let me try some  olive oil. She told me it’s very $$ thanks to limited supply. Markets responding to a politically created scarcity in such a way is a head trip. Individual sellers’ competition destroyed by land grabbing settler-colonialism. Profits

634 2018-01-26 22:24:30 I work in the Oil Industry. Trust me, we have OIL. It’s politics
635 2018-01-26 22:24:04 I've started mixing oils a few months back. For my face I use a mixture of coconut oil, jojoba and avocado. What do you think about that? Should I just eliminate the coconut oil completely? Lol sorry for all the questions
636 2018-01-26 22:24:01 But CBD Oil is wonderful?
637 2018-01-26 22:23:52 Any oil tonight lovely?

641 2018-01-26 22:23:08 These are overflogged issues, you’re free to believe he personally caused your business’ dwindling fortune.
I work in a global conglomerate, my company just declared billions of dollars in losses owing to this recent oil glut. Sadly, they don’t have a world president to blame

649 2018-01-26 22:21:59 Thank you.  Cooking oil seemed to help (plus took an antihistamine) Never reacted like that to a chilli before 
650 2018-01-26 22:21:58 Most of the 1970’s happened under Tory rule inc power cuts, mass industrial unrest, the oil crisis  & the three day week. Labour called in the IMF in early 76 a year or so after 5yrs of Tory gov. Can you imagine? The Tories are still blaming Labour after 8yrs !!
651 2018-01-26 22:21:49 New tires, oil, and air filter
652 2018-01-26 22:21:29 Have you heared of sperm oil? I'll let you guess where that comes from..
653 2018-01-26 22:21:28 She was a shit head. She bankrupted us wasted oil revenue on nothing screwed the country
654 2018-01-26 22:21:26 I live in a house built in 1650, there are 3 fireplaces, 2 bread ovens, hooks on the ceiling for oil lamps, shelves for candlesticks, a well by the front door. Good luck folks in modern houses, you'll need it.

659 2018-01-26 22:20:00 Shift in mindset when living tiny: not buying in bulk.  I don't have room to store 12 rolls of paper towels...I only need to buy 1-2 rolls at a time. I don't have to buy olive oil because my bottle is almost empty; I can buy it WHEN it's empty.
660 2018-01-26 22:19:52 When the flood comes, fish will eats ants and when the flood recedes, ants will eat fish. Only time matters. For making soap, oil is required. But to clean oil, soap is required. This is the irony of life. No one is self sufficient. Everybody needs somebody at any point in time..
661 2018-01-26 22:19:40 Ok Google, how do I remove jet engine oil from my favorite dress shirt that I wore to work because I'm an idiot?
662 2018-01-26 22:19:40 my dad just texted me asking “where I got the little humidifier in my room from” after explaining that it was an oil diffuser “what’s a diffuser?” 
663 2018-01-26 22:19:35 Zebra something...but it ain’t oil 
664 2018-01-26 22:19:34 In their defence, apparently Vlad Jr was what the Marlins wanted as part of the package. Bichette sure but not Guerrero.
665 2018-01-26 22:19:32 New oil deals、昨夜の六本松蔦屋インストアと、一昨日のユーテロ、ご来場ありがとうございました。本当に沢山の人にお世話になりながら活動できていると痛感しました。

674 2018-01-26 22:18:14 Trillions in welfare to corporate welfare queens - banks, oil, coal, Comcast, prescription drugs, etc.  IMF Externalities.  Most poor, middle class will pay higher taxes because of tax increases local and state gov level and higher healthcare costs because of more pollution.
675 2018-01-26 22:18:12 yeah, I definitely wouldn't suggest coconut oil with combination skin. lighter oils or oil free moisturizers, gentle cleansers, hydrating toners and brightening serums if you have hyperpigmentation issues and you can get a toner with exfoliants for exfoliating purposes.
676 2018-01-26 22:17:58 Unfortunately First Nation voices are heard only after US created sound reliable market for their fracked oil.Canadians left with under preforming windmills!
677 2018-01-26 22:17:50 Worst Oil Spill in East China Sea will have another horrible effect on the environment and that is a given. Oil and Water do not mix, Exxon did this before and the Gulf of Mexico ruined the gulf fishing and 50% of their fishing business are gone. What does Tillerson have to say?
678 2018-01-26 22:17:34 Considering how many people had issues getting oil and propane and using electric heaters instead it's no surprise some bills spiked
679 2018-01-26 22:17:29 Fully expect them to try & move all those guys out but outside of Z not sure on the return.
680 2018-01-26 22:17:22 I seriously need to take my car to get a oil change
681 2018-01-26 22:17:15 They sure werent doing this when Geo W Bush and Cheney left office. And God knows they had major skeletons with their war/oil issue. No bid contracts to Halliburton.
682 2018-01-26 22:17:03 And will wonder why oil prices tank when there's another oversupply
683 2018-01-26 22:17:00 At the start Trump and his gangster crew never really thought they could win. Trump was always fearful he’d be outed—womanizing to current wife and money laundering. Russia stepped in to get USA & sanctions lifted! Trillions in oil Putin wants. If Trump gives USA, his debts Zero!
684 2018-01-26 22:16:58 Bro can u cook chicken wit olive oil if aint no grease

691 2018-01-26 22:15:50 @Nitrado_EN is there any way to stop the oil pumps from restarting due to the auto server resets. It's not a huge deal but it gets to be a bit annoying. After all that's the premise of the oil pump.

699 2018-01-26 22:15:06 Nah, you're not naive. Murkowski may be moderate when it comes to healthcare, but she is well know to be in the pockets of big oil, that's why she's been pushing to open ANWR up for oil drilling for years. She threw a provision into the tax bill allowing for this to happen.
700 2018-01-26 22:15:04 Mirror confirm that Aymeric Laporte to Man City is done deal. Another oil money, another club-record fee.

702 2018-01-26 22:14:23 I remember reading his thread about them. "They want to be funny SO BAD."   

He also linked an article on why one of the first targets of oppressive regimes are entertainers and comedians.  All the wannabe collaborators who find themselves in positions of power.
703 2018-01-26 22:14:19 Dropped my car off to get an oil change & I got a call saying the filter on my passenger under my hood had a dead mouse covered in maggots. Just got my car back & it smells like dearth. brb puking

707 2018-01-26 22:13:12 Earthquakes alarm warnings. All from the drilling for oil. Taking from the inside of the Earth leaving empty space enables the Earth to shift causing Quakes.

Also the prison I’m currently in in escapists2 is an oil rig, so a normal perimeter breakout isn’t possible

713 2018-01-26 22:12:59 Is that green peas? In oil down? Nope!
714 2018-01-26 22:12:59 More proof pipelines like the keystone are the safest way to move oil.

If a leak happens with pipe systems, they close valves; flow and spill stop.

With boats, train cars ect.  Once the spill starts, it's impossible to stop and contain.

Pipelines better choice 4 environment
715 2018-01-26 22:12:54 We have the technology to solve this problem.    Filtration plants. Desalination plants    Build pipe lines  as we have done with oil. This is very fixable
716 2018-01-26 22:12:47 I'd add popcorn (popped in coconut oil of course)

724 2018-01-26 22:12:03 Gah- that's just not the true style, my friend. Fresh basil, sliced tomatoes, sliced fresh mozzarella, olive oil, and crust. I'm not sure where the version with tomato sauce came from. It's popping up more amd more, and I get sad when I see it. haha
725 2018-01-26 22:11:53 "without doctored data produced by folks with a vested interest in "climate change"..."big oil" has the largest vested interest against changing our ways. they will no longer make billions/trillions. MOTIVE ALERT. they are the data doctors.

727 2018-01-26 22:11:38 I’ve had that happen. He’s right when he said that it’s about the severity you’d get from hot oil. Yes the hot oil from a deep fryer is able to embed itself into the skin since skin is lipophilic!

734 2018-01-26 22:10:24 The one I want to try has a small bit THC in it. It’s the Emu Oil. I just wanted others opinions

Why does 'Israel' have embassies in Turkey?
Why does Turkey have a embassy in 'Israel'?
Why does Turkey refuse to attack 'Israel' let alone the illegal foreign bases in Syria that is training and arming YPG/PKK/SDF?

745 2018-01-26 22:09:03 I have a great feeling about this brother. . I'm using tea tree oil in the mean time.
746 2018-01-26 22:09:02 Now that I got my brakes && things fixed , now I need to get an oil change …
747 2018-01-26 22:08:57 Back to Peak Oil (demand and supply thesis) - they are variables and not constant. Peaks are not interesting per se - but their dynamics are. It is quite possible that we have several ( supply as well as demand) peaks!
748 2018-01-26 22:08:51 Midnight Oil ~ 'Dreamworld' from the album 20,000 Watt R.S.L. [1997]
749 2018-01-26 22:08:42 Weirdly, Philippe Mexes would be back middle. Ray Wilkins would be in it somewhere, covered in oil. This car may need to be a minibus coz I’ve got one hell of a waiting list here

751 2018-01-26 22:08:09 Prostitutes us to the Oil companies.
752 2018-01-26 22:07:55 I made them! I bought the ingredients from amazon. Jojo oil, vitamin e gel, and the oil pens. Cristine has a video of her making them and I just followed that.
753 2018-01-26 22:07:51 Having followed this for two years now (with little prior knowledge), I have learned that there is no such thing as an "oil market" in singular form, but "many markets of oil grades". 

Consider wines. Different colors and grapes. Same thing here. Each trends differently.
754 2018-01-26 22:07:33 Yes and you will never have a gas leak poison you or your family. Or an oil spill that ruins your land and water. You will never be able to light your water on fire when fracking contaminates it...poor boy
755 2018-01-26 22:07:21 Yes Olive oil
756 2018-01-26 22:07:20 IDK I feel like Vampires should be bothered by oregano instead of garlic... have you tasted straight up oregano oil?
757 2018-01-26 22:07:08 Oil and butter and a splash of water cause I feel like it needs it in the pressure cooker.
758 2018-01-26 22:06:47 Ross to really experience the offshore oil & gas sector. I feel you should undertake BOSIET training then carry out a 3 week nightshift stint as a roustabout on an aging relic of a platform. This would give you some real world work experience & a better insight in the industry.

760 2018-01-26 22:06:29 getting an oil change AKA a new car lmao
761 2018-01-26 22:06:18 If you economic parasites really want to learn about "the environment," I suggest you pay a visit to:
Flint, Michigan
Neighborhoods surrounding Houston's oil refineries
Neighborhoods surrounding anything the Kochs' own
The farms & small towns near industrialized animal kill mills
762 2018-01-26 22:06:01 I don't begrudge children getting assistance if they meet requirements. I don't know about you, but my taxes go for a lot of things I don't like -- bombs, support for oil companies, paying farmers not to grow crops -- & in the grand scheme of things, if $10 goes to kids, I'm ok.
763 2018-01-26 22:05:30 Good point - make sure you ask about oil, it’s generally sunflower - do you need translation help?
764 2018-01-26 22:05:29 I just came to Kia for an oil change and they’re trying to get me to swap out my car for the 2018 Optima  lmao
765 2018-01-26 22:05:25 “I’m gonna go home and put olive oil in my hair as a treatment.”
“You can do that with conditioner, too”
“Well olive oil was good enough for Jesus so that’s what I’m gonna use.”

wow i love my grandmother
766 2018-01-26 22:05:01 Leave conditioner on overnight, do masks with avocado/mayonnaise/olive oil
767 2018-01-26 22:04:57 Even if he did, we got him you didn't. I think the oil money is running out.

769 2018-01-26 22:04:44 I still have to eat 75 grams of fat before the night is over and i dont know what I’m going to do. Drink a whole bottle of olive oil sounds like a good option.  @1Jess_Phillips
770 2018-01-26 22:04:42 Develop it -- with the oil.
771 2018-01-26 22:04:37 What's not to love about a bunch of draft dodging kids and their dog driving around in a fuck van and ruining the insurance fraud scams of old oil barons?
772 2018-01-26 22:04:11 Our president is a con, a fake, a phony, a snake oil salesman, One simply does not build buildings in NY and Casinos in Jersey with out being mobbed up and payin out the back door to keep money coming in the front door. Billionaire? Not even on paper.

775 2018-01-26 22:03:31 Cannot for the life of me figure out what the minimum number of barrels is for an oil field to be classified as an "elephant". Any #oil experts out there who can help? #oilfields
776 2018-01-26 22:03:16 Olive oil is actually the solution to everythingg
777 2018-01-26 22:03:15 I said we should allow a USA presidential state visit as it will oil the cogs of trade.

We can still trade with the EU.
Brexit doesn’t mean we have to ignore the EU. We just won’t have to take in their citizens to be able to do it.
778 2018-01-26 22:03:15 To further cut costs, we are no longer changing oil in equipment. Also looking into goats for in season weed control
779 2018-01-26 22:03:05 We exhausted the Peak (supply) Oil arguments, so it is not a surprise that we are moving on to a Peak demand discussion. Spencer Dale of BP nicely frames (OIS)widely discussed observation by oil traders that when oil price drops to about $40 something blows up and prices recover.
780 2018-01-26 22:03:04 i got peppermint oil in my eye so now my left eyeball just feels very cold
781 2018-01-26 22:02:42 @SimonTVG Well Simon my friends will be home tonight. He is among 5% in the world with 2 blood supplies to his liver. They shut 1 off & he is doing well. He goes back every 2 weeks for how he puts it, "to get his oil changed".
782 2018-01-26 22:02:39 It was made Clear when he was Elected but played down. Hes a God Damned Muslim, That is why he caused so many wars and Destablised so many Middle Eastern Countries, it's a New World Order for Islamic Indoctrination possibly Funded by the Rich Arab Oil Countries. Ok call me mad 
783 2018-01-26 22:02:38 if u want a super fast lip plumper use cayenne pepper and coconut oil and you’re done

787 2018-01-26 22:02:22 As High Chair of the Board of Straight Edge, I am here to tell you I fully endorse CBD oil.
788 2018-01-26 22:02:00 What we're finding out though, per the example of Boulder county a designation of preserving open space doesn't mean destructive oil and gas drilling won't occur on it. Citizens paying for this should always be warned of that up front.
789 2018-01-26 22:01:58 Mix them with oil, salt, and pepper and grill em up.  Personally I like eating the red and yellow ones like an apple.
790 2018-01-26 22:01:56 Sukhdev just ordered a #Fiix mechanic to come to their house for a Oil And Filter Change on their BMW!  #Oakville #Toronto #Tech
791 2018-01-26 22:01:52 Isis took hold of oil rigs, it was transported through Turkey (nato), our crooked governments made massive profits. 

Also created the mass invasion into western countries, create chaos, breed out the white race final nail and it also culled the population. 

NWO
792 2018-01-26 22:01:51 Nigeria leaders are proud of oil why others nations are busy improving technologies . We order  everything from other countries Even our so called crude oil #ShitHole couture

794 2018-01-26 22:01:36 How do you have a car 8 hours and forget to give it an oil change…if it wasn’t free I’d probably be mad
795 2018-01-26 22:01:33 OIL DIFF: 4.21 -> 4.28
796 2018-01-26 22:01:28 It’s Extremely refined machine oil
797 2018-01-26 22:01:28 Its a typical coup seen all over South America the violence is on both sides It does not change the fact that there are gangsters trying to  bring down a democratically elected government cos they have oil they don't want the many to share in
798 2018-01-26 22:01:26 If you are in western Canada and produce CBD oil I'd love to hear more about your business. Please contact me. #cannabis #cbd
799 2018-01-26 22:01:21 No problem, the debt eats a serious part of their profits but they have good margins (better than Lukoil). Their investment is likely to pay off (maybe except Venezuela) - I did not invest in them. The rally will go on... They have the best connection to cheap oil (Iran... )
800 2018-01-26 22:01:08 I used coconut oil to clean my make up brushes because I ran out of baby shampoo & it can’t get the oily feeling off them 
801 2018-01-26 22:01:03 Former pitcher at Penn State and can get the oil can out and grease up the arm any time you need the BP! I’d be happy to!

810 2018-01-26 21:59:59 This case continues to be as clear as an oil slick...
811 2018-01-26 21:59:55 makin a mad dash to bring the garbage out when I have coconut oil in my hair so no one sees me & thinks I’m just emerging from my hole
812 2018-01-26 21:59:47 We can not afford to have oil spills along our beautiful coastline that also provides livelihoods of the coastal inhabitants.  The risk is too great.
813 2018-01-26 21:59:28 Yes and to draw YPG away from the oil fields so Iran can seize it.
814 2018-01-26 21:59:27 the ones my mom used to get were just oil, sometimes glitter
815 2018-01-26 21:59:11 นอนไม่หลับโว้ย เช้าแล้วนะ
816 2018-01-26 21:59:09 The terrorists are the people that start regime change wars for oil , opium and $$. The soldiers aren't fucking terrorists, they're doing their job. 

You disrespect them when you say that shit.
817 2018-01-26 21:59:08 Oh my gosh I was gonna buy coconut oil the other day! Thank goodness I didn’t! Thank you!!!
818 2018-01-26 21:59:00 Oil change give me that haircut feeling

820 2018-01-26 21:58:54 Thank you! As weird as it sounds, i wash my face with a mix of toothpaste and aloe Vera gel  I’ve tried EVERYTHING and that’s the only thing that keeps my skin clear! And raw tea tree oil at night!
821 2018-01-26 21:58:50 That was my point when I asked about definition: oil in transit is different from storage on water
822 2018-01-26 21:58:49 - Divine Distinction

824 2018-01-26 21:58:41 Is it just oil inside?
825 2018-01-26 21:58:12 Shiraz, neck oil, gamma ray probably in the wrong order. Up at 0500 so just a small Armagnac.
826 2018-01-26 21:57:59 Use lots and lots of cocoa butter all over especially your legs and tummy. Coconut oil for your face and hands.
827 2018-01-26 21:57:53 ""America First" won't mean the rest of the world falls behind"?

The US is falling behind thanks to trump's obsession with coal and oil, not to mention the lack of accessable healthcare, the removal of regulations that used to protect citizens from corporations...
828 2018-01-26 21:57:51 Big Oil pulled the plug on that then?
829 2018-01-26 21:57:29 If Tesla ever did such a thing it would crush the oil industry, and would destroy the automotive industry. Tesla already sells vehicle directly from manufactures to consumers. But will see, it would be nice to get off the grid!!!
830 2018-01-26 21:57:08 the little like oil bead ball things?! My mom got those a lot when I was growing up
831 2018-01-26 21:57:03 Avocado oil is hella good for you. FWIW
832 2018-01-26 21:57:01 Is that your reasoning? So POTUS deregulating the oil industry and opening up Anwar that will make the largest producer of oil on the planet is what Putin/Russia wants? You Dem/Leftest are such hollow idiots...laughable.
833 2018-01-26 21:56:59 please stop to talk about that...
in France we don't like palm oil!!!
834 2018-01-26 21:56:36 I've started wearing sage and cedar oil, but it wears off too quickly. Maybe I'll try sweating more.
835 2018-01-26 21:56:35 His father Joe "Joe for Oil" Kennedy  should be investigated for his dealings with Hugo Chavez.
836 2018-01-26 21:56:28 My doctors are ok with me looking at CBD oil because of this. Rn I need to choose a new med. one can ruin my heart, the other my kidneys & the third my liver. Well crap. I'm not exactly sure what to chose.
837 2018-01-26 21:55:51 Red states will not be happy until they’ve siphoned off all blue state tax money and drowned our states (not theirs) in oil spills.
838 2018-01-26 21:55:43 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
839 2018-01-26 21:55:40 Stop buying products made with PALM OIL!!!
840 2018-01-26 21:55:39 I CANT STAND dirty ass hair to the point where you look like you dipped your head in oil.
841 2018-01-26 21:55:37 He must have been drunk. Comparing robbery with  these state-backed terrorism?  Who is robbing other zones of their resources(oil)?
842 2018-01-26 21:55:33 That’s a new one on me. I’ll ask my mum about that oil.
843 2018-01-26 21:55:31 Yes they do the solar power jobs in Alberta since the ndp came in have exploded. Why do you think that Alberta is leading provinces in growth?its not oil!,
844 2018-01-26 21:55:15 Don't be sore, your coach will snake oil another kid into playing there, Or sell his parents a great used car...
845 2018-01-26 21:55:02 I really want a progressive candidate who is not in the arms of private prison, banks, pharma, oil, big corporations. Many are coming up through the ranks, but I'm not sure if there are even more than one in the Senate, or in state executive branches with significant experience.
846 2018-01-26 21:54:53 just got AC BAD a fresh oil change
847 2018-01-26 21:54:47 @potus Mr. President, general Jack Keane thinks we should 1. Build up forces in the NK theatre. 2. Attack them with cyber weapons. 3. Blockade their incoming oil etc.
This is a good time to make a call for initiating he military draft!
848 2018-01-26 21:54:43 What the deuce is this? Powder? Oil? Cream? What?
849 2018-01-26 21:54:30 We do Micro suction of ear wax: one ear £45, 2 ears £65 (fully trained and insured NHS, or HCPC staff). It is normally advisable to use olive oil prior to your visit.
850 2018-01-26 21:54:27 I love this concept! I found one in bracelet version with lava rocks all over. A really nifty gift and even more awesome to be a walking essential oil Lol
851 2018-01-26 21:54:20 Fingers crossed the Bio Oil does the trick, will you need to do any physio once you’re off crutches?
852 2018-01-26 21:53:51 I’d rather watch oil paint dry in the sun ... I already know the #StateOfTheUnion under the non leadership of 45 & the #RepugnantCons! 
853 2018-01-26 21:53:46 His tea tree oil shampoo and conditioner , heaven sent
854 2018-01-26 21:53:40 She just go burst oil pipe ni ooo 
855 2018-01-26 21:53:36 In Canada real estate is now worth more than oil to the economy and the same investors profit from both. Density is fine if the govt can take it out of the hands of capitalism. But so far it's been unable to do that. Hence why you see opposition
856 2018-01-26 21:53:27 So...i legit have build up in my hair from aloe Vera gel. Each one of my dreads. This is not about to happen. I will no longer use anything in my hair except black castor oil. And I’ve combed some dreads down just to get it out.
857 2018-01-26 21:53:11 Because he wants to make us all destitute and his oil & gas buddies would remain in charge. Keep the American ppl down & prop up the 1%. Depressing!
858 2018-01-26 21:53:08 My oil pan gasket didnt sit right so its like bone dry
859 2018-01-26 21:53:01 There are over 210,000 peer-reviewed studies confirming the existence of climate change, 4 studies... not a typo... FOUR studies funded by the oil industry to contradict it #ClimateChangeIsReal
860 2018-01-26 21:52:52 wiki also has biased mind about British empire killings, Oil wars, Hiroshima, Afghan-19xx vs Nazis,mangolis,Afghan20xx
861 2018-01-26 21:52:47 if you can get away with coconut oil and witch hazel, you might not have much skin issues to begin with.

863 2018-01-26 21:52:37 Trump THOUGHT about firing Special Counsel Mueller? Big deal! He didn't fire him.
I dreamt I ate Nutella after seeing it trend. Haven't had it in years because it's loaded w/Palm Oil from our depleted Rain forests & it's use is driving Orangutans to extinction. 
Am I guilty?
864 2018-01-26 21:52:22 Absolutely. Independent Scotland means you no longer have to pay for its free stuff. It’s a very unfair system. Penalises English taxpayers. Everyone knows oil is worthless and no tax is generated in Scotland. It was in the papers.
865 2018-01-26 21:52:12 Why is that? I currently use coconut oil and witch hazel. It seems to work really well for me, but what would you recommend?
866 2018-01-26 21:51:58 Scottish Oil & gas has always been a priority for Westminster just a bloody shame nothing else has been of any importance.
867 2018-01-26 21:51:50 My essential oil diffuser is so cool.
868 2018-01-26 21:51:40 EU-Australia Preferential Trade Agreement currently in the works. Would lower tariffs for Greek olive oil and yoghurt exports. Turkey, for obvious reasons, does not want to lower tariffs with EU/Greece.
869 2018-01-26 21:51:40 If only it were that easy
870 2018-01-26 21:51:36 Oil, big loss. Spy small loss.
871 2018-01-26 21:51:27 It's about 8 inches long. Once I get the bio oil on there hopefully it will fade.
872 2018-01-26 21:51:23 James wants to work off shore on an oil rig and he’s made me watch Deepwater Horizon to understand what it’s like :-))) death sentence by the looks of it, enjoy boo xx
873 2018-01-26 21:51:18 Quincy Carter was a 2 nd I believe  but again JJ knows more than everyone else  treats Draft picks like oil wells. Always taking risks to hit on that big gusher. But to often comes up dry

875 2018-01-26 21:51:11 I guess the oil industry should cease delivery to NYC asap. Let's see who wins
876 2018-01-26 21:51:01 I came to get a simple oil change & my tired rotated. Now it’s messing up. 
877 2018-01-26 21:50:48 Yesterday, Mexico’s National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) launched a tender to award 37 onshore oil & gas blocks to be operated through license contracts; bids are due on July 2018.
878 2018-01-26 21:50:47 Oil change, windshield wipers all done. In perfect timing for this weather and mini road trip that I think I got brewing.
879 2018-01-26 21:50:12 "you know your oil light is on? You should get it changed." 

Me: *making the I know face*  "it's always like that, it's old." Lol
880 2018-01-26 21:50:07 Diatomaceous earth (main component in kitty litter) is also used in pool filters to clean water, is a wonderful absorbent for spilled oil, and will deodorize furniture. I worry more that they just spit and cough in my food.
881 2018-01-26 21:50:03 Thick as engine oil ND viscous as grease
882 2018-01-26 21:49:56 Did you use any oil?
883 2018-01-26 21:49:51 GOP killed itself. Trump is burying it. Corporate Democrats have made themselves, and my former party, GOP-lite. Center-right and owned by the banks, big oil, big pharma and so on. Time for a new party People's/Progressive/OurRevolution.
884 2018-01-26 21:49:51 Trying keep Trump the Republicans, an Russia forcing the cost of a Barrel of oil higher! Follow the bank accounts of everyone who stands to benefit!  Lock Them Up
885 2018-01-26 21:49:39 If only this oil could change itself 
886 2018-01-26 21:49:35 Looking back at Oilers fans clamouring to trade 1 of Yak, Eberle, Hall, Nuge...for help on D.

Scary to think in 2018 all 4 of those could be gone from Oil Country.

889 2018-01-26 21:49:11 Well this will be the first and last time I come to Valvoline. I appreciate the instant part but not for $50 lol

He rerouted an oil pipeline towards Native Americans’ land, the Standing Rock Sioux Nation, without their consent, infringing on their treaty rights and contaminating their water and that of 17 million Americans downstream.

925 2018-01-26 21:43:03 The tweet you quoted has oddly circular logic. There is actually no reason at all for Oil to trade at $400 when Gold trades at $5000. Gold could easily trade at $5000 with oil trading at $20 and the Dow at 4000 in a depression. Silver would in that scenario underperform vs Gold.

954 2018-01-26 21:39:12 I agree. We need density and walkable neighborhoods, in which people can work where they live. We need solid public transit. That is half the equation, the other half the draw down in oil and gas production itself; the complete enviro position is to fight for both.
955 2018-01-26 21:39:07 During the boom years I drank with staff that told me of oil buyouts where the owner was jacking up prices of wine because "they never look at the bill". The way the UCP rallied around that place was sad. During the recession o&g didn't buyout places anymore.

1017 2018-01-26 21:30:56 The market continued its parabolic move higher that now has

1018 2018-01-26 21:30:48 Gettin an oil change during lunch was an excellent idea, def don’t wanna b bothered on the weekend
1019 2018-01-26 21:30:42 The media called a 4-fold tax rise on palm oil in France he Nutella tax, missing the point about palm oil wrecking the planet.
1020 2018-01-26 21:30:41 I sexually identify as a single, Pringle, ready to mingle. Ever since I was a potato I dreamed of being thin sliced, covered in disgusting oil then heated in a medium oven until reaching climax at the micro second of golden-browness.
1021 2018-01-26 21:30:39 On everything out Standard Oil. They're just in a social outlets.
1022 2018-01-26 21:30:37 media, question electricity doesn’t grow on trees, oh you burn oil lol people are so naive
1023 2018-01-26 21:30:17 We have already seen a number of accidents caused by off shore drilling.  It presents enormous danger to wild life, causes ocean temperatures to rise even more. We absolutely must invest in renewable energy-not oil which will run out eventually.  Oil represents millions of years

1027 2018-01-26 21:30:00 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
1028 2018-01-26 21:29:42 Yeah, he should be doing proper Labour things, like sexing up dossiers and invading oil rich Nations....
1029 2018-01-26 21:29:29 Oil burns are nasty, yo. Different to contact burns. I would like to stop burning myself now.

1032 2018-01-26 21:28:59 Ok....my 81 year grandfather is trying some medicinal Marijuana oil for the first time today. Ordered the strongest I could get him ... let's see how this goes .
1033 2018-01-26 21:28:51 You forgot to add:
More drilling , more oil crude oil , more fracking, bring back Fake jobs from China, more guns, and certainly blow up ‘shithole’ countries.. stay tuned I sure there is more!
1034 2018-01-26 21:28:50 “Yup. They’re... interesting. Fun.” And Saeran *really* likes the music. His hand slip lower to wash as he begins to hum a song from Oil, one he’d taken a particular liking to.

1037 2018-01-26 21:28:36 @StJude are you open to #cannabis oil treatments? Even if only to abate side effects of other treatments. Just learned of a boy given 1year window  #Florida after brain surgery couldn't get entire tumor. #prayerswanted
1038 2018-01-26 21:28:33 Because we import processed crude. If our refineries were functioning we would have a low price with more income. Nigeria can't keep relying on oil cuz the price of import will only increase expenditure and if possible increase debt as well.
1039 2018-01-26 21:28:31 No, it’s been a long time since that method was used. Though the oil cans are still around, clearly! – bij Kennywood Park
1040 2018-01-26 21:28:28 And @steam_games after wasting my battery with the fucking password reset I can’t even do because the car dealership I’m at getting an oil change has no WiFi. So yeah fuck you fucking fucks.
1041 2018-01-26 21:28:20 @FAN960 @FAN960RKerr  great to hear Gino on radio talking Ok Oil.  Great voice and could be awesome voice in the NHL one day. @GDP_PXP
1042 2018-01-26 21:28:19 yes 頑張っていくぞ！
1043 2018-01-26 21:28:11 Went to get an oil change expecting to spend no more than $37 and ended up spending almost $80
1044 2018-01-26 21:27:51 And the military — the largest single user of oil and gas. Can’t forget them.

1046 2018-01-26 21:27:33 Warning: the naïve ERA5MUZ virus sends your bank details to every Nigerian oil minister that requests them by email
1047 2018-01-26 21:27:18 Balancing the budget would mean we are taking advantage of the higher oil price, meaning we are very dependent on it. So what is she saying? Besides, how much deficit can the new oil pricing fund so far? Does anyone know?
1048 2018-01-26 21:27:00 Welp I just got an email from the governors office that they’re gonna start building military drones in okc. I bet the oil companies are squirting with excitement.
1049 2018-01-26 21:26:59 The carnival has left town with our money for snake oil 
1050 2018-01-26 21:26:42 Wow so that means they are over 500k contracts long!?! That’s like half a billion barrels of oil long! That’s insane... stupid bulls
1051 2018-01-26 21:26:31 ご参パイ……
1052 2018-01-26 21:26:28 they just would lower their temp so hard core due to having a low volume of oil
1053 2018-01-26 21:25:36 I’m doing so many things today I feel so freaking productive like wow y’all never expected this huh I cleaned my car I got an oil change I’m cleaning my closet and room it’s over for u bitches
1054 2018-01-26 21:25:26 Boost body lotion with baby oil If you're craving shiny legs that aren't greasy, blend a drop of baby oil into your normal body lotion.
1055 2018-01-26 21:25:23 Try warm olive or coconut oil for hair - leave it as long as poss in a towel, you’ll need to wash it twice. Oilatum is best for super dry skin. Good luck with the rest!
1056 2018-01-26 21:25:22 I will find out whether the rumour you have heard is true, and ask for an explanation.  I don't quite see your oil and water analogy.
1057 2018-01-26 21:25:16 I have 5 popcorn makers and a bushel of popcorn, butter, and oil waiting for that day.

1063 2018-01-26 21:24:24 The oil rich owner makes winning the league more viable, we could have gotten Van dijk Keita and Lemar in the summer if we were ready to pay outrageous prices
1064 2018-01-26 21:24:19 Well buy any commodity when the dollar is getting trashed....but now $ shorts are at an all time high. Oil long and platinum longs are at an all time high. If that reverses, $ will bounce somewhere. Commodities cud correct accordingly
1065 2018-01-26 21:24:12 u can change ur oil very easily on ur own, and its so much cheaper!!! but try to look for coupons and stuff next time! :o
1066 2018-01-26 21:24:05 It’s amazing how many products have palm oil in them. Check ingredients and don’t buy.
1067 2018-01-26 21:24:02 Oil or jungle CHIMP???
1068 2018-01-26 21:23:47 Of course they are... it’s all connected to the quick buck Trump and his nightmare vision of making  a crude oil comeback ... what a mess !

*Has the rise of social media been good for society as a whole, or because do the cons (manipulation of information and addiction) outweigh the pros?
*Are companies like Amazon becoming the Oil Standard Trust of the 21st century?
#RTOvertime
1070 2018-01-26 21:23:03 so i drive to Mobile to get my oil changed.. after the oil change i drive away and my window won’t roll up  so when i bring my car right back dude says “well it may be a while to fix do you have time” i got all day. i didnt bring my car like this so i wont leave like this!
1071 2018-01-26 21:22:49 if this is a duke energy project do you really think this is about OIL? if it's true it's a duke energy project it is undoubtedly for nat gas. please at least think before you start screeching

1075 2018-01-26 21:22:29 Thanks BG best of luck finding @DirtyErn12 I’m rocking a tangie oil cartridge in his name
1076 2018-01-26 21:22:24 I don't do ANYTHING with my natural hair.. I'll wash it & stuff, oil it up or leave it in a bun or puffball & keep it moving
1077 2018-01-26 21:22:22 details? hahaha no, Gallant and details are like oil and water - they don't mix
1078 2018-01-26 21:22:12 Weed cool and all but these oil cartridges is where it's at
1079 2018-01-26 21:22:07 Other then the small fact I’m 8000 miles over my oil change life is great. 
1080 2018-01-26 21:22:04 I’m so glad you asked! I use Cantu leave in conditioner, olive or coconut oil especially on the ends, sometimes I use loc/twist gel to limit frizz or Shea butter.That’s my routine almost every night then I twist it in sections. I untwist and separate and oil the ends in the a.m
1081 2018-01-26 21:21:37 the dinosaurs exhibit is sponsored by an oil company. Does that count as political?
1082 2018-01-26 21:21:06 The pit will contain mud, jelly or just body oil?
1083 2018-01-26 21:20:52 Oil, the curse
1084 2018-01-26 21:20:48 Trying to salvage what is left of my @GioventuUK coconut oil - this stuff is insane!! I put it in my baths, over my face, through my hair between shampoo & conditioner. It’s just SO G O O D 
1085 2018-01-26 21:20:43 Sooooo I need a oil change and my nails and toes done but I’ll wait until tomorrow 
1086 2018-01-26 21:20:32 I feel so brand new getting new tires, oil changed and some food
1087 2018-01-26 21:20:25 Definitely Rigged ECONOMY with American people NOT represented! WHY is Gasoline prices STILL going up After the Tax Scam Cuts, off shore AGAIN  APPROVED by Trump! Only Reason I see for INCREASE is because Big Oil can get away with it UNDER Trump who we know wants to Hurt people!
1088 2018-01-26 21:20:20 ひとりさびしいのできてください(..)
1089 2018-01-26 21:20:16 That is the same with Norway - but only for the oil! 
1090 2018-01-26 21:20:07 Never thought an oil cap would make me look like a bitch.... #sorrygirls
1091 2018-01-26 21:20:02 That time of year again when you don’t know what to do with hands while the oil change men are cleaning your windows
1092 2018-01-26 21:19:58 Bkk Mobile Oil. kennt keine Sau. Bin mega zufrieden mit dem Service. War jetzt 6 Monate krank und es lief alles rund mit denen. Und die haben viele sonderleistungen 
1093 2018-01-26 21:19:44 Have done quite a bit of research on this. Reported that the CBD molecule itself is really too large to effectively pass thru skin, so transdermals minimally effective. You might also/alt try an oral oil (under tongue admin) for better value/effect.
1094 2018-01-26 21:19:41 Maybe Im a pessimist in the sense of petrol or oil in general, but I hope we have a swift change in fuel source and let oil only be used for specific industries, like the chemical industry or some cars here and there (do love me some Formula 1)
1095 2018-01-26 21:19:39 the biggest oil plunderer, which is called U.S by the rest of earth, now plays its tricky games over syrian oil but now turks are big a obstacle for U.S @washingtonpost @TIME @WSJ @Reuters @cnni @DeutscheWelle @FRANCE24

1099 2018-01-26 21:19:12 You have to feel sorry for the fifth musketeer, Zakynthos, who pissed his money away on olive oil & mopeds
1100 2018-01-26 21:19:08 Coconut oil is a proven comedogenic oil meaning it can clog your pores. Everything doesn't work the same for everyone. But deny facts because it works for you.
1101 2018-01-26 21:18:47 just put coconut oil on my hair and holy god my hair feels incredible

1104 2018-01-26 21:18:08 I get static real bad in my best friend's house. I run a little vaporizer for a day that that takes out the static for a while. even my essential oil diffuser helps.
1105 2018-01-26 21:18:05 I hate to burst your bubble. You were considered a has been in 2008. PNAC was formed in 1997 and it didn't even care about you. It was all about the Middle East--not some poor, wretched country that didn't have the oil the #neocons wanted.
1106 2018-01-26 21:18:05 Pretty sure where they sit in the standings is just fine with them. Also, no shame in grabbing loser points in today's NHL
1107 2018-01-26 21:17:58 actual heartbroken at that btw, just assumed they’d be in normal oil ugh
1108 2018-01-26 21:17:49 Need to do my oil change but really don’t feel like going to dodge 
1109 2018-01-26 21:17:17 Attention went to oil rich Iraq and fertile Syria.
1110 2018-01-26 21:17:09 So paramedics, police, health care workers, nurses aren't hard working? Many of the oil sands workers are unionized. Are you suggesting these folks don't work hard? Please tel them about it next time you meet one of them.
1111 2018-01-26 21:16:59 And for even more VITAL success...for our children...a Federal Energy Sys that punches hole for oil lifting...new refineries...a profit cap at a Federal Gas pump...takes our DOW thru the stars to Alpha Centari.

1119 2018-01-26 21:16:14 funny story:today while i was driving to school my engine shut off & i was stuck in the middle of 205..i restarted the car & started driving and got on the highway,then the oil light came on and said i had ABSOLUTELY no oil in my car..long story short the car could’ve blown up

1127 2018-01-26 21:15:21 We can start with working to reduce crude oil imports(we will still need refined imports as our capacity to refine is currently logistically and economically difficult), as well as exporting crude and LNG to the developing world (who’s fossil fuel use is on the rise).

1129 2018-01-26 21:15:06 Today we played the game ‘I went to market and I bought...’ but replaced it to be ‘the Romans invaded Britain and they brought...’ so we learnt all about the roads, olive oil, linen etc

1149 2018-01-26 21:12:16 Also #Millennials buying habits seems to going fresh/organic foods less packaged compared to the baby boomers.  Millennials also buying 70s old fashions.  During the oil crisis years. I could be mistaken on that presumption.

1156 2018-01-26 21:10:57 While you’re on, I’ve heard a disturbing rumour that the GFSC Investment Division now reports through the Head of Fiduciary. Do you know if this is the case? In my mind Funds and Fiduciary are oil and water.

1162 2018-01-26 21:10:22 Getting rid of oil benefits everybody. Aside from climate,  aren’t you fed up with oil wars? Spills?
1163 2018-01-26 21:10:19 In CO, leaders w/ties to O&G try to gain political cover, by focusing only on density & vehicle emissions & hide the very real issue with fracked gas & oil - essentially treating it as clean energy that we are required to use.

1166 2018-01-26 21:09:37 Your mcm thinks he’s a ‘handy man’ because he can change the oil and tires on his car. Ain’t shit handy about that, everyone should know how to do this.
1167 2018-01-26 21:09:25 For youthful skin, mix 1 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup oatmeal, 1/4 cup mashed figs, 1 oz vanilla. Leave on 20 mins.

1170 2018-01-26 21:08:55 yup after my toner. It's like the more I was trying to wash the oil off my face the more my skin would get greasy

1176 2018-01-26 21:08:33 @CoopDuck @CGoreham  Rob You must be watching a different game to me to say on the Scrimmage that Zimmerman was the best German signing. He was trying to turn last Saturday and it was like an oil tanker. Plus some terrible passes from defence in the 2nd half. Surely Trybull !
1177 2018-01-26 21:08:31 through the FDA rarely are things not somewhat tested but it still contributes to harm reduction and it's an option that is vegan and will show more people it's not as hard as ppl make it out to be.

1182 2018-01-26 21:07:59 Where did you get this from? Really undermines the (obviously dumb) argument that Norway is only rich because of their oil reserves/wealth
1183 2018-01-26 21:07:45 Coconut oil. 
1184 2018-01-26 21:07:40 Big. Oil.
1185 2018-01-26 21:07:38 Your message is incomplete though. In State's like CO, oil and gas production via fracking & residential drilling account for the most emissions, with vehicle emissions a very close second. We need what you describe & an immediate scale down of all fossil fuel production.
1186 2018-01-26 21:07:35 Our oil down is made with pigtail, breadfruit or cassava and coconut milk. I doh know what dat thing you eating is!

1189 2018-01-26 21:07:12 Especially when the oil's filthy. Nothing like the risk of infection, y'know?

If you know oil mill market in portharcout, then you know.
1197 2018-01-26 21:06:12 This is unacceptable.  I hope people can do what I'm fighting to do - not eat meat.  Even cheap meat.  Period. But some of our fruits & veggies in Cali are being tainted with wastewater from big oil I just found out. Oh my gosh. Even a wine brand is! I don't drink but geez!
1198 2018-01-26 21:05:55 Come for an oil change and you leave broke Bloody everything's so expensive
1199 2018-01-26 21:05:39 That's a hell I've unfortunately experienced before. Burns are bad enough, but hot oil burns are in a league of their own.
1200 2018-01-26 21:05:39 Many of those countries are oil producers. All of them use petroleum a lot more than any renewable.
And who fooled you into thinking Nicaragua would be in that list? I’ve been there & they give 0 f’s about the environment. Nice country though.

1202 2018-01-26 21:05:15 As manager for a global oil services company, another manager called me, out of the blue. I asked if he wanted to progress a new technology strategy as I'd requested previously. He replied: 'No, but could you look after one of our guy's kids tomorrow as he has an important mtg'
1203 2018-01-26 21:05:03 that's cheap for synthetic... but sit in your car while motherfuckers change oil.  worth it imo

1206 2018-01-26 21:05:00 Since there are no berries in the house and the idea of eating what is essentially a pure coconut oil truffle (even if it's sweetened and chocolate flavored) is nauseating rn I've resorted to eating straight up cream cheese.
I don't know how much longer I can last doing keto

1215 2018-01-26 21:04:14 It's really easy if you have a big packet of mixed seeds at home already. You pretty much just mix together seeds, a bit of salt, flour, water and oil, roll it out, cut it up and bake! I don't do this all the time, mind 
1216 2018-01-26 21:04:11 My guess is that they have realised that late 2017! They must be smiling... Look how Rosneft jumped in the last week, heavy oil is the key, shale oil will have to be badly discounted!

1238 2018-01-26 21:00:52 lol right. I was so confused just now. Mind you, if you're using a toner with witch hazel, coconut oil shouldn't be your moisturizer to begin with.
1239 2018-01-26 21:00:46 Combine 9 oz unicorn tears with 4 1/2 tbsps Guancamole. Mix into  Olive Oil. Fry. Serve with love.

1241 2018-01-26 21:00:32 I don't know about the rest of you but I'm rarely eating seafood anymore and might give it up completely. Radiation, mercury, oil spill toxins and fewer regulations on energy production under this dickhead admin? Yikes.
1242 2018-01-26 21:00:24 Pipeline to send oil to New Brunswick from Alberta?  Better to have pipeline to BC and the US
1243 2018-01-26 21:00:24 They don't want stability,  they want the Oil. Their is no difference between DAESH and the PKK. IF YOU WANT STABILITY DON'T ARM THE TERROR GROUP YPG, PKK. And  if you don't know how to handle a terror organization leave it to you NATO member Turkey. @ikalin1 @TC_Basbakan

1251 2018-01-26 20:59:32 (long oil infrastructure, services). The curve is inverted. The odds are, it will go further into negative territory...

1263 2018-01-26 20:58:33 I better not cashew in those lines... @SkinnyPancake just switched to a new spread because Nutella has palm oil. Save the rainforests!

1266 2018-01-26 20:58:04 Oil tankers, the largest vessels in the sea, take 20 mins/15 miles to stop and need 1.5 miles to u-turn.

1270 2018-01-26 20:57:51 Does castor oil help with hair growth?
1271 2018-01-26 20:57:38 For sure. But Palm Oil really is made by slaves and child laborers in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. Any company that uses that should be boycotted
1272 2018-01-26 20:57:24 Will dig out. That said they've apparently note managed to source 100% sustainable palm oil
1273 2018-01-26 20:57:22 One of the new rose bombshell bombs, the big sleep, Secret Arts and 3 of the essential oil melties.

1280 2018-01-26 20:56:39 How about you stuff it with the false equivalencies, Gary. That argument's right up there with "buy Alberta oil because we don't push gays off buildings" - it's ridiculous.
1281 2018-01-26 20:56:14 Its not oil its “petrol” according to your manager
1282 2018-01-26 20:56:12 The dude lied his way into a trillion dollar war, killed hundreds of thousands, opened an extrajudicial prison/torture camp in Cuba, made a bunch of shitty giveaway deals for his oil company and war profiteer cronies, but at least he didn't say "shit hole".

1294 2018-01-26 20:54:26 Chocolate and hazelnuts. But mostly oil.
1295 2018-01-26 20:54:22 Russian #Economy expected to rise 13.7% this year, as #oil output reaches record high.
1296 2018-01-26 20:54:14 Story, story, story. Once upon a time. Pls can we stop referencing the past and focus our energy on the future. Develop human resources, build human capital. All these talks about oil should cease!
1297 2018-01-26 20:54:00 I would say the oil. Mostly because it’s palm oil, which is the worst.
1298 2018-01-26 20:53:55 i use peppermint oil all the time you just can’t use a full drop
1299 2018-01-26 20:53:55 Tonight I will be making garlic olive oil couscous with lentils and avocado, bring your own dish and utensils!

1304 2018-01-26 20:53:00 Archive footage of Man City before oil money on BBC right now......
1305 2018-01-26 20:52:56 Also US imports more oil now from Iraq than Saudi.
1306 2018-01-26 20:52:52 Well. When I was preg w my daughter I would order tuna on Italian herbs n cheese add bacon pepperoni and cheese and a chicken patty...toasted...then add spinach olives s&p vinegar and oil ranch and mayo.....yeah......lmao
1307 2018-01-26 20:52:51 I have no idea what that is. I’ve been using @nativechild_co castor oil
1308 2018-01-26 20:52:41 Brain inflammation, cognitive impairment, light & sound intolerance. I agree ... the worst symptoms. Can't research! Stuck! CBD oil helps.
1309 2018-01-26 20:52:38 omgggg thank you sanam  it's mostly oil and sweat 
1310 2018-01-26 20:52:37 Worst part is Big Oil is now running our US Government.
1311 2018-01-26 20:52:32 Baby oil
1312 2018-01-26 20:52:23 Awesome! Thanks for the reply! One step further would be to have to change the oil every certain mileage..... not sure if that’s a step too far though 
1313 2018-01-26 20:52:19 Well it can help! Yes good eg adding psyllium husk to oatmeal to bulk it up you can consume 25% less calories with the same volume in your stomach! That’s why butter, mayo, oil, peanut butter, cheese, nuts, all really add up… High caloric density. #KetoFreeGirl 
1314 2018-01-26 20:52:18 I forgot. In Seeking Alpha world, we are heading to 100.
1315 2018-01-26 20:52:11 Really sucks when teachers only care about their paycheck, rather than your education. As a teacher, you assume the responsibility of educating this nation’s youth and when you are more concerned with your oil painting classes than what we learn, we are the ones who suffer.
1316 2018-01-26 20:52:10 happy birthday to Castrol @colinfarmery , forever pouring oil on troubled Pompey waters
1317 2018-01-26 20:52:07 Gosh yeah. Hot oil doesn't fuck around. Hope it wasn't too bad!
1318 2018-01-26 20:51:59 Trump's plan didn't backfire. Rex Tillerson and the rest of the oil oligarchs are very happy about this. They want the solar industry to shut down completely and allow the fossil fuel industry to thrive with less competition. #LeaveItInTheGround
1319 2018-01-26 20:51:57 Dietary cholesterol is now kosher. To paraphrase The Jesus, it's not the cholesterol which goes into a man's body, but what is generated within it.  It is good, tho, to mix in plenty "good" oils. I advocate scrambling eggs with olive oil, but that's probably wrong given my luck.
1320 2018-01-26 20:51:55 @Deganna he's not an oil fan I was referring to the flames being swept.
1321 2018-01-26 20:51:54 Peppermint tea or peppermint oil on your temples or nose helps
1322 2018-01-26 20:51:43 we’re making tunes for exclusively bluetooth enabled tide pods now
1323 2018-01-26 20:51:31 dawg go to the valvoline instant oil change and you can sit in your car for like 20 mins and your oil is changed.  it's good shit #oilchange
1324 2018-01-26 20:51:28 My oil change was $66 I’m actually upset

1329 2018-01-26 20:51:00 Why do American Jews still vote Democrat ?
1330 2018-01-26 20:50:59 This girl said coconut oil isn't bad for you skin if you clean your pores "right" is that true? 
1331 2018-01-26 20:50:53 So you buy like 2 lbs chicken cut it into little pieces add Cajun seasoning. I make mine it’s paprika, cayenne, black pepper, garlic salt, and thyme. Then you add a little oil on a pan and throw the chicken in and close it w/lid and let it cook.
1332 2018-01-26 20:50:45 Naw she didn’t. She said moisturizer = coconut oil  toner= rose water/witch hazel ...meaning the toner is witch hazel and/or rose water not a coconut oil “flavoured” one.
1333 2018-01-26 20:50:41 I'm going to park my large ugly self NOT in the waiting room, but in their showroom. Want me gone? Hurry it up re oil change
1334 2018-01-26 20:50:33 Tell me @OfficialMAOAM, by putting Palm Fat instead of Palm Oil in your ingredients listed on your packets, does this excuse the above behaviour?
1335 2018-01-26 20:50:18 I totally want to eat my baby, he smells so yummy, and I put sunflower oil on him for his dry skin, and it feels like I should pop him in the oven!
*obviously I won’t, I’m not a carnivore.
1336 2018-01-26 20:50:01 better than dead oil?
1337 2018-01-26 20:49:48 夏コミ分の作業もあると考えると、割と切羽詰まってる気がしますが、頑張ってみちゃおうかなーとか安直に考えてたりしますｗ
1338 2018-01-26 20:49:26 Then I'll have fresh oil in my car :O
1339 2018-01-26 20:49:23 Drugs, oil, gas and diplomacy on Tillerson's (@StateDept) first visit to Latin America since taking office under @realDonaldTrump's administration. Do not forget Tillerson headed ExxonMobil for 10+ years as a leading dealmaker. 
An overview for each country visit:
1340 2018-01-26 20:49:22 Mineral oil doesn't dry, harden, polymerize, spoil, or go rancid. So if it's not making contact with you, WHY IN the WIDE world of SPORTS would it need vitamin e stabilization?
1341 2018-01-26 20:48:59 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
1342 2018-01-26 20:48:47 I think that's what I need. I don't put any oil on my face and I neeeeed to.
1343 2018-01-26 20:48:41 The poverty= advantage man uses his plight to oil his opinion against the ditched patron in such a way as to sound the bebefactor"s view so true that the poor man"s trickery ain"t obvious!Slur in the poverty garb!Listen!Daaji"s votary!

1345 2018-01-26 20:48:39 Getting my oil changed ;)
1346 2018-01-26 20:48:34 Haven't been taking my hay fever tablets but didn't think I'd need them this time of year. I've heard cod liver oil works wonders for this problem so I'll try it
1347 2018-01-26 20:48:28 It’s 45 degrees in Duluth, and I just changed my oil and washed my car. 
Someone high five me.
1348 2018-01-26 20:48:02 B cause they are lazy and  want everything free. There is enough oil in Mexica to run that country for 10 years or more. Let them build refineries with their drug money.
1349 2018-01-26 20:48:01 Good it won't be drilled for oil......yet
1350 2018-01-26 20:48:00 ever since I started moisturizing with tea tree oil mixed with vitamin e oil every night it's cut down on my oiliness a LOT during the day
1351 2018-01-26 20:47:57 You are missing something so blatantly obvious difference. We are owned by a sports group and City is owned by a oil/gas mogul who could quite possibly dump 2-3x as much money into transfers. Our transfer policy is pretty understandable considering how little money FSG holds
1352 2018-01-26 20:47:53 Oil Can Boyd has quite a history. He played for the Red Sox. He pitched most of the games under the influence of cocaine.
1353 2018-01-26 20:47:45 It’s amazing what good flat irons and a little coconut oil will do.
1354 2018-01-26 20:47:43 As soon as you THINK you got your life together and on the right track, you need a oil change that f***s ya life up! 
1355 2018-01-26 20:47:30 Wainting for oil to come down lately is like waiting for Godot
1356 2018-01-26 20:47:29 Well, that would solve your impending financial ruin...
1357 2018-01-26 20:47:26 She said coconut oil toner, not raw coconut oil
1358 2018-01-26 20:47:19 You have to have respect out here in the oil patch or you'll never make it.
1359 2018-01-26 20:47:16 This would SIMPLY be ....heaven to #win for my skin to look .... ARGAN ...B-OIL-utiful. Thanks xxx
1360 2018-01-26 20:46:44 Which brand of coconut oil and olive oil ?
1361 2018-01-26 20:46:20 Most all contractors now are lawsuit conscious and will not even let rig hands carry their phones on the rig floor.
1362 2018-01-26 20:45:50 That Mayonaise is not a proper replacement for engine oil...I Know.
1363 2018-01-26 20:45:43 Hmm. Oil leaks Buggering drive freewheels....this months gremlin...grr
1364 2018-01-26 20:45:35 I heard the money sent home now exceeds the profits from Mexican oil. Certainly close.
1365 2018-01-26 20:45:20 Shell is expanding beyond the oil and gas industry, having spent over $400 million on items including solar power materials and electric car charging ports in the first month of 2018 #shell #solar #business #expansion #solarenergy #electriccars #carbonfootprint #reduction #ENN

1374 2018-01-26 20:44:29 Damn I hate getting my oil changed on fridays
1375 2018-01-26 20:44:11 Nothing more than a resurrection of dead stinking " news." It's a real chore to come up with new stuff when there is no there, there.
1376 2018-01-26 20:43:55 There’s coconut oil in the acne relief kit!!!
1377 2018-01-26 20:43:52 Conversation in the future :

-We completely deforested Indonesia because of the increase in palm oil demand.
-Yes, but at least we provided Nutella and sweet snacks to the whole world 365 days a year for a few more years.
1378 2018-01-26 20:43:46 Truthfully, go for it! Love to hear Gretz’s take on the current state of The Oil and what’s cookin’ with the Wayne Gretzky Estates Winery and Distllery.

1386 2018-01-26 20:43:06 Overcoming adversity. Oil light came on. Car was NOT happy. I bought some oil. I actually found where the oil should go. But I had help from an amazing passer by, Nikki. So BIG shout out to Nikki for helping!! #goodpeople #help #positivity 
The kindness of strangers!
1387 2018-01-26 20:43:04 *whispers* put some wild grow oil on those receding hairlines kings.
1388 2018-01-26 20:42:46 this counteracts the rubberyness of banana and stops the eggs from mixing with them and sort of scrambling? play around with fats too and try oil & butter in various combinations as this can add to it. Worst come to worst throw some chocolate in & make brownies!hope this helped!
1389 2018-01-26 20:42:43 Wow my feet are soooo crusty they soaked up all the castor oil I put on them
1390 2018-01-26 20:42:42 You do know oil prices collapsed and I suggest you read the Barnett formula
1391 2018-01-26 20:42:40 Lmao I never said anything about oil and gas. I realize we need oil and gas but we can still be environmentally conscious and this administration is not.

1393 2018-01-26 20:42:29 Can y'all give me a free oil change? I'm poor.
1394 2018-01-26 20:42:26 Thanks, Obama, better than the crash of 08 from the Bush oil wars.
1395 2018-01-26 20:42:25 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
1396 2018-01-26 20:42:20 In the north, a cow is more valuable than a child. So what is crude oil?
1397 2018-01-26 20:41:52 Mineral oil for skin care or laxative use, I can see. Laxative mineral oil causes Vitamin E deficiency, so you might want to compensate for that. Skin care mineral oil may not need Vitamin E but your skin does. But suppose I'm not using it for either. Pointless / harmless?
1398 2018-01-26 20:41:50 My dad just poured dilute all over the food he was cooking thinking it was cooking oil
1399 2018-01-26 20:41:44 President Donald Trump and Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke want to open up our beloved California Coast to oil drilling and leasing. Make your voice heard in opposition to the proposed 2019-2024 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program. -
1400 2018-01-26 20:41:41 Does not surprise me. His oil man was best buddies with Castro.
1401 2018-01-26 20:41:41 I could really use $1000 right now, esp this extra cold winter when heating oil is so high. Wasserman is an elitist jerk
1402 2018-01-26 20:41:25 Hate when I get the burps after taking a fish oil pill 
1403 2018-01-26 20:41:24 Drowning someone in olive oil is the equivalent to Italian water boarding.
1404 2018-01-26 20:41:16 Ion do shit for my car but put gas in it. I JUST started checking the oil 
1405 2018-01-26 20:41:04 Cartels (like OPEC) will often produce more product to get more money, but this does not benefit them in the long run because they end up dropping the price of oil for example to a lower price.
1406 2018-01-26 20:40:49 Coconut oil really does so much for my skin 
1407 2018-01-26 20:40:46 @CNBCClosingBell @larry_kudlow Removing regulation is an understatement. Larry, I hope none of your children or grand kids live near a coal ash pond or any oil pipelines or oil rail tracks. Stop kissing @realDonaldTrump 's ass.

1428 2018-01-26 20:38:39 So he spun the Venezuela question to lessons to be learned from the U.K. failing in our losses in oil!!?? Incredible
1429 2018-01-26 20:38:39 Failure seems to be a combination of mechanical forces destroying the seal and oil getting in from externally. A leaking hub looks most likely which is traction fluid, it has a habit of getting past seals.
1430 2018-01-26 20:38:26 my car is so gross and i’m taking it in for an oil change but i didn’t realize they’d be all up in my car, i left my frappucino and my phone charger in there agh
1431 2018-01-26 20:37:52 Coconut oil for win 
1432 2018-01-26 20:37:49 I had Reynauds in my 20’s and 30’s. My doc told me he couldn’t prescribe it but anecdotal evidence suggested fish oil helped. I’ve been taking it ever since with no sign of it. I’m 74 now.
1433 2018-01-26 20:37:43 I’m about to say something quite wanky, but aromatherapy oils are improving my quality of life. If you are a stress head I very much recommend getting an oil diffuser. House smells lush and anxiety levels are improved.
1434 2018-01-26 20:37:40 The main problem about Nutella is that it needs palm oil which is a major cause of deforestation (killing animals by the way) and is not healthy at all
1435 2018-01-26 20:37:39 #Oil prices rose this week on the back of a weakening #dollar – thanks to comments from the U.S. Treasury Secretary supporting a weaker greenback – and ongoing declines in U.S. inventories.
1436 2018-01-26 20:37:03 Oil isn't heavy its lighter that water and if these people want it pumped they need to dig ditches and ditch it, and stop having babies they can't feed and don't have water for not everything is the word responsibility. They have had centuries to get water to themselves....

2 years ago Papa QJ (The Wasp) had to have Chemo, and it is why he's alive today.  He could, of course, have tried Cannabis Oil, and now, most likely he'd be dead.   So, no, I won't do polite engagement with fucking idiots
1446 2018-01-26 20:35:46 Me too. Have Discoid Lupus - SUPER sensitive face skin. I use Cerave and jojoba 'oil' (Amazon). Luv that jojoba!! Also, drink lots of water.

1452 2018-01-26 20:33:59 3) Don't drop the ball because US & RU weapons (including if not especially cyber/security) industries depend on the promo bump of Cold War rhetoric because oil, coal & car manufacturing's ability to chip in on our GDPs is dwindling by the minute.

1454 2018-01-26 20:33:44 Things I question dudes on all the time:
You can't do your oil change? 
What do you mean you can't turn on a pilot on a gas range?
How do you not know how to properly use a vice grip?
Wait, why don't you have a proper tool box at 30 years old?
1455 2018-01-26 20:33:42 Clear enamel over scratches to prevent rust, I've used nail polish for touch up, colored or clear, it's cheap and can protect from rusting, but nothing is perfect & will show. Wipe with alcohol before any touch up / paint is applied, paint won't stick well to wax, road oil, etc.

1513 2018-01-26 20:25:52 Lol, you really believe seasonality of product builds is irrelevant? Or that gas and distillate inventories being below last years levels and roughly the same as they are every year this time is somehow bearish to crude?

1573 2018-01-26 20:18:07 That's near on my favourite bit. Awesome. I love everything about that tattooine opening  !  Time for a long overdue oil bath
1574 2018-01-26 20:17:58 Everyone knows that when that anointing oil comes out and your mum says "I need to pray for you , I've had a dream" , you best sit your arse down and pray
1575 2018-01-26 20:17:39 I was thinking of debt, have you heard of people that buy blocks of peoples debt and then cancel it? That's what the kind of thing I was thinking of, of course I don't know anything about oil and gas leases, just an idea.
1576 2018-01-26 20:17:30 Heard one State official saying that he would like California's State sport to be "surfing" because of that sport's emphasis on environmental protections. He said, "If Trump surfed, do you think he'd approve of off shore oil drinking?" He has a point.
1577 2018-01-26 20:17:20 Having worked on drilling boats in that area, if they were *planning* to drop their 1st stages there, I've got another issue to add to our "things which may kill us and cause a multibillion dollar oil leak" list for the morning meeting.
1578 2018-01-26 20:17:17 Face full of oil.
1579 2018-01-26 20:16:59 I don’t know how to check my oil

1584 2018-01-26 20:16:33 I stopped buying what the snake oil salesmen were selling, 20 years ago.
You just sound more desperate and shrill as time goes by.
1585 2018-01-26 20:16:29 hype for a oil change & car wash.
1586 2018-01-26 20:16:29 Profit over environment, every time! That's the GOP way.  Quality of life, for The People, is of no concern.   Trump just rolled back safety rules to "lesson the burden" on energy companies (making billions).   Keystone leaked 210,000 gallons of oil last year - don't worry NC!

1589 2018-01-26 20:16:23 maybe they thought it was the new white people cure all, coconut oil lmao
1590 2018-01-26 20:16:16 @AwkwardKittyInc hey on your car look under and look were the oil filter is see if it's leaking and call the oil change place if it is they might have your car towed back to them and fix it for free
1591 2018-01-26 20:16:07 I cleanse my face first, pat dry, use toner (it helps restore ph balance to the face, I use witch hazel), oil, moisturizer.
1592 2018-01-26 20:16:01 Seems consistent with pushing boundaries and testing limits of normality. Would say she has a point
1593 2018-01-26 20:15:53 Hydrating and moisturizing are two different things. Dehydrated skin lacks water and therefore needs to be hydrated. Dry skin lacks oil and needs to be moisturized. ... Dry skin that is hydrated but not moisturized will still flake and have a rough texture, hydrate AND moisturize
1594 2018-01-26 20:15:52 It's like ordering a cocktail of motor oil and cod liver oil and only fussing about the latter
1595 2018-01-26 20:15:46 Jamaican Black Castor Oil>>>
1596 2018-01-26 20:15:32 That’s our mission - get the world to eat more olive oil and more olives!! Hope you have some planned for your weekend meals 
1597 2018-01-26 20:15:26 How the fuck do you think Nutella is able to be spread? Of course oil is involved
1598 2018-01-26 20:15:23 You keep cherry picking data.  Compare to demand.  Context matters.
1599 2018-01-26 20:15:12 So you use the jojoboa oil then put the moisturizer on top then toner?
1600 2018-01-26 20:15:01 If Rick Simpson oil doesn't work on you no edible will bro don't waste your money just get wax!
1601 2018-01-26 20:14:54 Then give Kudos to PMB for his efforts on agriculture. However, oil is still our number one source of income. Nigeria would have been like London if GEJ was informed when it was over $110pb. So PMB celebrating is not out of order
God will bury the enemies of Nigeria in landslide.
1602 2018-01-26 20:14:45 @jamieoliver desperate to make the delish looking salmon roast on tonight's Friday night feast, but don't eat bacon, anything else you could recommend to go on top instead? Splash of oil and smoked paprika maybe? 
1603 2018-01-26 20:14:43 It releases water vapour and maybe scented oil, supposed to help when you've got nasty coughs and colds.

1610 2018-01-26 20:13:55 You don't have to go the expensive route. Just stick to your Green List. All You have to buy is Coconut oil, Your natural herbs and xylitol

1613 2018-01-26 20:12:40 My skin feels so dry I put on three moisturizers and a face oil
1614 2018-01-26 20:12:31 It's probably not locked up cars have a safety on now they will not start and it will shut down when you boil gets down so low it keeps your engine from locking up if you add oil I bet you it'll start but make sure that shop knows they fucked up
1615 2018-01-26 20:12:28 Prolly finna go get my oil changed and head to the mall
1616 2018-01-26 20:12:24 palm oil tho :/
1617 2018-01-26 20:12:06 @oilfractals @CashErrthing Maybe I'm being naive, but crude build API, lowest crude draws in a while on EIA and huge rig count increase, looks like the tides are shifting, next few weeks should be bearish :-) Have a good weekend!
1618 2018-01-26 20:12:06 So they impeached Bill Clinton for Monica Lewinsky, and he wasn't also money laundering with Russia, or destroying our reputation abroad and sucking up to oil barons, or lying or ignoring shootings, Bill was growing an economic surplus and they impeached HIM. So... seems like...

1621 2018-01-26 20:11:51 Which one is oil casava 
1622 2018-01-26 20:11:51 I’ve been using the shea moisture black soap lately and making sure I apply toner afterwards. You also might need more moisture to combat the oil. I recommend a little Jojoboa oil and then apply your moisturizer (again I’ve been using shea moisture)
1623 2018-01-26 20:11:32 Thanks @cazrolinaa for the plug 

'Maize meal, olive oil and lemon juice' does wonders to my skin 
1624 2018-01-26 20:11:30 It belongs to whatever oil company drills for it ONLY after they pay for it in the form of royalties. Alaska even shares the royalties with Alaskans. They each get a $1,000 check every year.
1625 2018-01-26 20:11:26 someone at work over the summer saw my raben thing on my keys and he told me i didn’t look like the type to get my oil changed and i was so offended bc what does that even mean, but yesterday i was telling @MollyHaaff i haven’t had my oil changed in 13,000 miles 
1626 2018-01-26 20:11:25 Getting my state inspection done and an oil change before these road trips. Last two days have been busy as hell.
1627 2018-01-26 20:11:24 Didn't read about this much anywhere today but latest Flow Show from BAML showing we're close to sell signal in equities.  With pretty much every asset class looking stretched (equities, oil, gold, usd, ust's, etc) I'll be unloading some risk today.
1628 2018-01-26 20:11:22 I think he believes your product is "marijuana", rather than the hemp oil that is actually is. Our Prime Minister legalized marijuana, which takes effect this July.

1630 2018-01-26 20:11:10 Senator common sense,the president didn't celebrate increase in crude oil price,he only promise Nigerians how the money  would be spent on infrastructure,roads,rail and power.

OFAC also sanctioned the North Korean Ministry of Crude Oil Industry, which handles crude oil for North Korea.
1640 2018-01-26 20:09:35 At least the oil is used by your body to its benefit, it's the 10,000 empty useless calories, in the bottom of the jar I'd be scared of
1641 2018-01-26 20:09:28 i just got an oil change & car wash for $3 , its a good friday ! 
1642 2018-01-26 20:09:03 We have sooo many other Natural resources in Nigeria asides Oil, who's mining them? Where's the money going? You have no idea how rich Nigeria is 
1643 2018-01-26 20:08:55 I've got goose fat at the moment, seem pretty nice.  Some things just need that proper fat. Olive oil and roast potato, not for me.
1644 2018-01-26 20:08:52 Have been nose to the grindstone writing away here while my car's oil gets changed and it's gorgeous outside, just got stuck when I encountered a transition problem. Now cleaning out purse and pondering... #amwriting
1645 2018-01-26 20:08:34 I mean no. It was more then an oil change
1646 2018-01-26 20:08:15 Subway Club, mayo on the bread side, provolone, lettuce, tomato, green peppers, onions, banana peppers, pickles, a couple of jalapeños, salt, pepper, oil and heavy on the vinegar. BTW, and chance you could add Garlic Pickles to the veggies????
1647 2018-01-26 20:07:45 What does an oil company have to do with anything? I’m saying - and have links to back it up - that oil found on US land or waters belongs to the US.

1654 2018-01-26 20:06:15 No doubt people will want Klopp with oil rich owners. Many should watch his 1st presser and learn reasons why he chose LFC in first place.

1656 2018-01-26 20:06:08 Kara. You had my support until this. Corporate taxes need to go up not down. And we need an HST. It's time Albertan's grow up and realize that if we want high quality services, we have to pay for it. Dependence on oil revenues for decades has made tax a four letter word.
1657 2018-01-26 20:06:05 He shouldn't celebrate because that wasn't his making, and it can still be affected by some external forces. He should start thinking how we can operate an economy not dependent on oil.

1663 2018-01-26 20:04:31 try cbd oil! got my sister hooked since we both suffered from migraines since we were kids. she not much of a smoker (like myself) so the oil is perfect. most vitamin/healthfood stores carry it nowadays! (plus it'll help relax you when surrounded by crazies, aka: retail)

1668 2018-01-26 20:04:10 World is still stuck on $0 or negative interest rates. World econ is heating up, so how long will they keep up this currency manipulation?
1669 2018-01-26 20:04:04 New US sanctions on Russian companies and individuals. Among them is EvroPolis, the Prigozhin-linked firm through which Russia signed its deal to produce and sell 25% of *all* Syrian oil and gas.
1670 2018-01-26 20:04:02 Gari with oil. Standard.
1671 2018-01-26 20:04:00 And that we didn’t “take the oil” does not mean that many, many different American companies profited greatly from that war and the fallout thereof, just like every other war in history.
1672 2018-01-26 20:03:57 Ha...! No..... Lead singer is a lecturer in Brighton Uni.  Guitarist an electrical engineer in Hull. Drummer is an oil refinery worker in Immingham. Keyboard player is retired I think lol.  Rock'n'Roll eh?!?
1673 2018-01-26 20:03:53 I need tea tree oil my hair already dried out
1674 2018-01-26 20:03:23 Drilling in wildlife refuge.Drilling in the ocean. Allowing big oil and coal to do whatever they want. Allowing migratory birds such as eagles to being killed and wild horses killed. How can anybody with a heart or conscious like or support Trump. How is he still president.
1675 2018-01-26 20:02:58 Why are the Yeovil fans booing Sanchez? So turning down the oil arab playground for the world biggest club makes him a ‘mercenary’? #SanchezIsRed #yeovilmanunited
1676 2018-01-26 20:02:44 PM has zip to do with Sears closing its doors like so many car plants have etc over the years and oil jobs you name it. Was there anything special there ? At least we have this to fall back on

1704 2018-01-26 19:59:01 Well, thats not what I was meant. If you buy an oil lease is it not up to you when and how much you pump?

1707 2018-01-26 19:58:49 The President celebrated high oil prices today. We should not overemphasize oil. According to @Forbes, 4 of the top 10 richest Black people in the world are Nigerians and the top 2 did not make their money from oil. Nigeria’s human resource is more valuable than oil, develop it!

1713 2018-01-26 19:57:45 Use tons of coconut oil and palmers cocoa butter all over the belly, I got very few because of it, and I was a stick figure prebaby.
1714 2018-01-26 19:57:43 I got a Cantu leav in conditionging cream (cuz im basic and i saw a bunch of bloggers use it) but i"m nottt sure what oil works best for me yet. I have flaxseed, grapeseed, JBCO, coconut.
1715 2018-01-26 19:57:24 Perfecto! Desde ya empiezo a votar. Te amo desde México
1716 2018-01-26 19:57:21 1. That's a pretty big stretch to be making. Maybe you'd be more right if we took the oil like Trump suggested ;)
2. We're talking about the system that reflects on it's own population, not the outside world. Communism killed millions of its own people. Nothing like that here.
1717 2018-01-26 19:57:08 Wolf plans to expand DEP budget, add 35 employees, for oil and gas permitting
1718 2018-01-26 19:57:05 Gotten used to technocratic doublespeak and lipstick on pigs, you would rather be whispered meaningless pleasantries.
1719 2018-01-26 19:57:05 Russian oil companies have never been so profitable and Russia deficit was 1.5% in 2017! What was the US deficit? 
1720 2018-01-26 19:57:03 #NutraliteResolutions I luv Parantha and can't live without them but I'll shift from fried Parantha full of Oil to Parantha made in Air Fryer without Oil and will put on top f it Healthy (Fat Free) and Yummilicious #Nutralite Butter
1721 2018-01-26 19:56:53 Does it make sense to make 20x leveraged bets on oil price going up? Or should I just drive to the nearest gas station and buy as much oil as I can?
1722 2018-01-26 19:56:53 Oil is not going to disappear overnight. It's a big segment of the economy. Would have too negative of an effect on the economy. Even less likely under Trump since government subsidies have played a part driving the transition away from oil.
1723 2018-01-26 19:56:52 I paid Walmart nothing.
They told me to tow it, not drive it.
Drove it to my mechanic, she changed the oil.
$41.
1724 2018-01-26 19:56:52 Hi Nancy! Sorry for the confusion. Our grapeseed oil is refined, making it most stable than most unrefined grapeseed oils. So refrigeration isn't necessary, but you are still welcome to store it that way. Hope this helps!
1725 2018-01-26 19:56:48 I'll tell you the one thing about PES that burns my oil . I'll be playing well, and then just out of nowhere the CPU throws up a lobbed through ball to a forward, there is no one within 15 yards of him and I have no clue how any of it happened.
1726 2018-01-26 19:56:44 Use body lotion. For very dry skin, use baby oil after a bath.
1727 2018-01-26 19:56:40 Waiting at dealership during oil change. One man, four women sitting with me. Guy walks over, looks just me squarely in the eyes.

"Anyone named Monica?"
1728 2018-01-26 19:56:27 There’s so much coconut oil in and on my body. I am a coconut now
1729 2018-01-26 19:56:13 My lip balm has it in it haha, probably should get strictly coconut oil
1730 2018-01-26 19:55:55 I had a fast migraine starting to come on from my anxiety. Put on peppermint oil and within 5 minutes it's almost gone. 5 minutes people.

I don't care what y'all say PEPPERMINT OIL IS LIFE
1731 2018-01-26 19:55:47 @Masandawana go get Mtambo fro Chipa united, Kekane's oil is finished! He reminds me of Linda Buthelezi #ssdiski
1732 2018-01-26 19:55:39 Lol... Aight,i'd try...it's a unit capable of handling production of 200,000 barrels of oil per day, as well as separating different components of hydrocarbon (oil, water,gas) and then storage capacity of about 3,000,000 barrels of the crude for export.
1733 2018-01-26 19:55:35 And the matter at hand is what YOU ate ain’t oil down lady. U get ‘fubumbled’
1734 2018-01-26 19:55:20 (2)china is fearfull that in the time of tension usa can stop the supply of oil with the help of indians.because indians not like china and china not like india.

1742 2018-01-26 19:55:00 Biodiesel was invented in the 1890s by Rudolph Diesel, when he created the diesel engine that could run on a variety of fuels including peanut oil.
1743 2018-01-26 19:54:59 There are over 210,000 peer-reviewed studies confirming the existence of climate change, 4 studies... not a typo... FOUR studies funded by the oil industry to contradict it

1746 2018-01-26 19:54:42 We are sanctioning additional oil, shipping, and trading companies that  continue to provide a lifeline to North Korea to fuel this regime's  nuclear ambitions and destabilizing activities."
1747 2018-01-26 19:54:28 It's at its best when the people in government actually care about serving the interests of the people and not special groups.

@SecretaryZinke - take any helicopter rides lately? How about putting an oil derrick down right in Yellowstone?
1748 2018-01-26 19:54:10 I didn’t tie oil to consumer spending at all was simply saying it was another factor in why the economy slowed in 2016
1749 2018-01-26 19:54:09 We have enough energy to be independent of all foreign #Countries. Oil,gas,coal,windmills and Solar to name a few. Electric cars require coal to make electricity! We have professionals working on kinds of energy. It’s not safe to depend on other Countries.
1750 2018-01-26 19:54:07 Called ahead and they said they weren’t busy but I’m still waiting to get an oil change an hour later. End me
1751 2018-01-26 19:54:06 No importa que vote desde México ?

1753 2018-01-26 19:54:00 I remember the Obamas telling everyone it was safe to go to the gulf coast after the BP oil spill then jetting off to France for vacation instead of going to the gulf coast.

1756 2018-01-26 19:53:33 Agreed, but I would argue that the one against the Oil last night is nowhere near the worst GI call we’ve seen this year
1757 2018-01-26 19:53:16 Today has been a shit show. Inhaling my essential oil necklace to make all my problems go away...

1759 2018-01-26 19:53:12 @AndyMohrChevy over an hour wait for a scheduled oil change.  Not how I wanted to spend my Friday.  2.5 hours total just to get it changed with the wait.
1760 2018-01-26 19:53:06 If I was Trini, I wouldn’t have been an Oil down fan either.
1761 2018-01-26 19:52:39 Avocado oil is the new wave.
1762 2018-01-26 19:52:39 I'm gonna make soap using my breast milk , honey , coconut oil and ground oatmeal :) and use it on my stretch marks daily :)
1763 2018-01-26 19:52:35 Norway has a sovereign wealth fund of 1.8 trillion USD courtesy of their oil and gas. In contrast successive WM governments have squandered Scotland's oil wealth. Remind me again .@RossThomson,how is this union good for Scotland?
1764 2018-01-26 19:52:06 Madness. It's full of palm oil!
1765 2018-01-26 19:51:58 I use coconut oil. What do you use ?   We should talk about hair more
1766 2018-01-26 19:51:49 My hair isn’t sticky either. HANDS. Like sticky with hair gel and mouse and spray and anti frizz serum and coconut oil (greasy not sticky but same thing) after I do my hair when it’s curly I always need to wash my hands stat!
1767 2018-01-26 19:51:34 I honestly don’t trust ppl that put coconut oil on their face
1768 2018-01-26 19:51:30 I know they have oil and 2 major religions that don’t get along.
1769 2018-01-26 19:51:05 My nephew has adhd. And one time I put my focus essential oil blend on him and he was like "oh my god- I feel like I'm floating in an ice river".
1770 2018-01-26 19:50:58 Come home to empty oil tank - can I shove some diesel in it until I can get a delivery
1771 2018-01-26 19:50:52 sweet oil
1772 2018-01-26 19:50:33 Then WHY are you taking the PEOPLE'S land and cutting deals with oil/mining interests??? Uranium mining in Bear's Ears? Ryan Zinke is NO Teddy Roosevelt!
1773 2018-01-26 19:50:29 Wellllllllll. I’m no oil down fan either so 
1774 2018-01-26 19:50:23 I say just invest in a good deep conditioner and a good oil and get a steady routine going. it really helps a LOT
1775 2018-01-26 19:50:14 @AnthonyMaceroni What do we think about $CHK - very attractive looking bottoming pattern here 100dSMA conversion and sitting on it as support now. Oil continuing higher needed for it realize potential though.
1776 2018-01-26 19:50:11 I cheat I buy the minced already in olive oil from Trader Joe’s lol
1777 2018-01-26 19:50:09 Very complicated times indeed. I'd not long come over from NI to the UK, it was like frying-pan into the fire.  Looking back it's clear that the Coal industry was being replaced by offshore gas and oil. Union should have pushed for those miners to be offered jobs offshore.
1778 2018-01-26 19:49:59 Yeah I’m not saying it’s the same by any means. CBD oil won’t mend it by Any means but should help with the pain when it gets really bad x
1779 2018-01-26 19:49:52 Dear World, the oil spill is killing my friends, polluting our water, and destroying our homes.  We are sad. Please stop it. Love, SpongeBob
1780 2018-01-26 19:49:52 My dad owns 1/2 of a '27 in slightly better shape.  Flat head 4, single engine/transmission oil reservoir.  You need to reverse up steep hills or the engine will seize.
1781 2018-01-26 19:49:38 eh who cares it’ll grow back! and if you don’t like it just throw some castor oil in it every week and it’ll be back eventually
1782 2018-01-26 19:49:26 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
1783 2018-01-26 19:49:20 US crude oil futures settle the week at $66.14 Up $.63 or 0.96%
The US crude oil futures are settling the week at $66.14, up $.63 or 0.96%.
The high today reached $66.35. While the low extended all the way down to $64.91.
1784 2018-01-26 19:49:15 @El_Philthmoor is colloidal silver and oregano oil self to use?
1785 2018-01-26 19:49:10 So much of that out of date. By all means criticise, but keep up with the narrative. The SThree conflict of interest sadly now history. Another disasterous oil co role gone. Supporting corrupt regime's indyref back-fired. Tax avoidance issue very much alive.

But boy I'm loyal to the oil that boil
1790 2018-01-26 19:48:28 Idk why I didn't jump on the coconut oil bandwagon along time ago.. Its an awesome makeup remover too 
1791 2018-01-26 19:48:27 Tomorrow ima go get this oil changed
1792 2018-01-26 19:48:15 Yup whatever. Like I said Russia and Mexico are far more greater. But I guess OIL has nothing to do with it. But who am I never been right on anything. We are done here.
1793 2018-01-26 19:47:55 Haha. Although the cb550 didn't have oil reservoirs on the shocks, so those are custom. ;)
1794 2018-01-26 19:47:53 Their skin is so soft Joel! And they said,in the wild,the water they swim in is pretty murky & has a bunch of dirt and oils that settle on their skin & keep it soft when they hover on the surface. But the zoo keeps theirso clean they have 2use special hippo oil on their skin!
1795 2018-01-26 19:47:42 Aye aye. Try yuh bess. Bout we oil down.
1796 2018-01-26 19:47:38 No. Everyone. People need jobs. People need to pay their mortgages. Money is needed to buy things from other countries. The people can't survive on turnips, potatoes North Sea Oil and pine trees. #StopBrexitSaveBritain

1799 2018-01-26 19:47:21 Lol Of course, I have had my share of Oil Soup .
1800 2018-01-26 19:47:20 It was a real cock up, because miners were highly skilled for the most part, but they were all stood on picket lines fighting with the police while there were well paid offshore jobs springing up. Oil/Coal it's all energy. Strange times.
1801 2018-01-26 19:47:13 Find someone to help coordinate the message for the dems. $20 bucks extra a paycheck wont cover the cost of gas once oil hits $80 per barrel while the dollar tanks, HC prem rise & tariff costs are passed to the consumer. How do I spend the stock market gains on groceries?
1802 2018-01-26 19:47:10 Yes, it does.  Look at rbob today.  Outlook is that with turn arounds gasoline is at a critically low level.  That puts import model into play, which increases cost.  This will boost refinery margins accordingly.  There is no "build", there is just a reserve prior to draw period
1803 2018-01-26 19:47:03 Oil producing state
1804 2018-01-26 19:47:02 I'm sorry no lol sugar, lemon , and add some olive oil or coconut oil to it etc do it when you're in the shower or whenever !
1805 2018-01-26 19:46:58 Kogi state commissioner for Agriculture has said revenue from Cashew nuts from the state would surpass that of crude oil. 
Me: Wonderful. It means the whole of Kogi is filled with cashew trees. No houses, no human and the cashew tree produces cashew nuts every minute. Olodo!
1806 2018-01-26 19:46:47 You should’ve taken civics or an economics class. The 1st year of a new president, is working on the budget on the last pres. So,  12 to 18 m. Also, we’re no airliner we’re like an oil tanker takes longer to crash it. If we were a jet we’d all be dead.
1807 2018-01-26 19:46:40 Only gas, food, clothes, oil change, date night dinner out, haircut, new knife, box of bullets, new battery for my truck, new toys for the kids,.......
1808 2018-01-26 19:46:31 Got this oil change and my car went from driving like a focus back to driving like a mustang
1809 2018-01-26 19:46:25 is oil wet..?
1810 2018-01-26 19:46:21 Where can I find those gorgeous oil slick nails
1811 2018-01-26 19:46:18 Correct.
It doesn’t even have a head gasket.
It does have a side gasket but the oil is on the center & water flows on the outside.
Keep in mind, WALMART told me the head gasket was blown.
I panicked.
My mechanic set me straight :)
1812 2018-01-26 19:46:11 Beard oil allegedly but I still itch with it.
1813 2018-01-26 19:46:02 Something with tomato, basil and garlic oil!
1814 2018-01-26 19:45:49 Meanwhile while all that was going on thousands of working class lads like me had landed jobs on rigs in the north sea on daft money to make sure thatcher had enough oil to fuel the power stations. Miners could have had those jobs too. We were all RMT Union.
1815 2018-01-26 19:45:24 I’m told it’s an olive oil thing
1816 2018-01-26 19:45:09 @OilersNation @Woodguy55 @Bob_Stauffer @JasonGregor @EdmontonOilers ... heard Oil have lost 14 straight challenges. The Situation room is in Toronto right? Any coincidence?
1817 2018-01-26 19:45:02 Sounds like the Knights R looking 4 some oil because their knees must be quaking in this battle. We could ask @FightingOwlsHCC for assistance as fellow Owls or reach out to @CSMHawks @CecilAthletics @AACCAthletics or @hccathletics as our feather friends for help, but we got this!
1818 2018-01-26 19:45:01 #Skincare Ingredient Tip: Avocado oil is full of Vitamins A, E and D as well as palmitoleic acid. #antiageing #skin #beautytip
1819 2018-01-26 19:44:40 Yes! American version is loaded with sugar and palm oil, it's disgusting. You can't even taste the hazelnut.
1820 2018-01-26 19:44:37 Oil .. Only oil
1821 2018-01-26 19:44:33 I get your point, just to point out that Ifeajuna was said to be the mastermind of the coup. As read in @maxsiollun Oil Politics and Violence
1822 2018-01-26 19:44:05 Oil money you wish you had. 
1823 2018-01-26 19:44:05 see also: bankers, telecoms, utilities, oil & gas drillers... it's a long list Zack.
1824 2018-01-26 19:44:03 Oddly, the fares haven't come down since the last time they raised fares because oil was too expensive.

Funny how that works.
1825 2018-01-26 19:43:57 Roast ‘em with olive oil and salt (plus lemon, garlic, whatever you fancy).
1826 2018-01-26 19:43:44 My fav gotta be Baba Ganoush 2 with extra virgin olive oil and the power of christ compells you hahaahahahahha love you papa ps. I have the gay 
1827 2018-01-26 19:43:36 The State of CA should definitely join in this suit. CA has suffered  unprecedentedly from climate change related disasters this year, and all Trump has done is reward big oil with record tax cuts and permission to drill on our pristine coastline! Enough!
1828 2018-01-26 19:43:29 Oh I’m a big fan of rapeseed  oil x
1829 2018-01-26 19:43:12 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
1830 2018-01-26 19:43:06 I co-sign! I add oils to my body lotions too - olive, almond, carrot and coconut oils are my usual rotation. I usually use a light oil mist on my face too, then a moisturizer if I must.
1831 2018-01-26 19:42:53 *Playing Sonic Mania* Oh goodie Oil Ocean Zone. Out of all the zones  they could have picked, sure glad I get to relive this place.
1832 2018-01-26 19:42:44 Obviously I was saying that tongue in cheek. Nobody voted leave because of Olive oil you muppet.
1833 2018-01-26 19:42:44 The 3ds game 4u had a more story focus of dealing with major threats to the ecosystem which were causing major issues, gore magala being a monster that spreads a virus which drives monsters into a frenzy and a walking oil pile driving other monsters into other habitats.

1839 2018-01-26 19:41:45 So in essence, everything he said was either an exaggeration or a straight lie and all just to boost his ego ! Once again, no surprise. He seems incapable of telling the truth - a born snake oil salesman !!!
1840 2018-01-26 19:41:44 Getting an oil change and car wash on this sunny Friday summer please hurry. These nice days are such a tease
1841 2018-01-26 19:41:35 California is suing the oil companies right now since Trump took office for climate pollution. There might be more involved I’m not sure. I didn’t get that far in article.
1842 2018-01-26 19:41:01 I been using this oil to get my hair to thicken. It’s working but it’s hard af to flat iron my hair now
1843 2018-01-26 19:40:56 It could help! It reduces oil/ dirt in your skin which leads to smoother/ clearer skin!
1844 2018-01-26 19:40:48 If you scrape it off the top it's just palm oil bro. You can just get to about halfway, and throw it out
1845 2018-01-26 19:40:47 Keystone helps no one but China. That is where that oil is going.
1846 2018-01-26 19:40:43 Michael there's a pound of oil soaking into his suit collar this is not a drill
1847 2018-01-26 19:40:29 My smart shake from @USANAinc uses clean and pure ingredients with no added sugar and uses coconut oil as the energy source
1848 2018-01-26 19:40:23 First I hear moisturizer with coconut oil then I hear don’t do it? Which is it?

1851 2018-01-26 19:40:03 I would like to send my brother Derrek King aka DK a big THANK YOU! For purchasing cbd oil from me.

1854 2018-01-26 19:39:41 Oh man thank u!!! It's abstract oil but the paint is mixed with wax to make it fluffier and less thick and shiny
1855 2018-01-26 19:39:33 The thing the baffles me is that the dumb people seem to think that scientists are being paid by people with agendas. It's exactly the opposite. Climate change deniers are the ones in the back pockets of oil companies. It's pretty well documented too.
1856 2018-01-26 19:39:31 Yall use regular olive oil?
1857 2018-01-26 19:39:30 Got my oil changed today. My car better not ask me for nothing else.
1858 2018-01-26 19:39:26 Oil went to 42 dollars in the summer based upon 2 key factors 1. doubt that OPEC+ was impacting stocks (due to a build) and 2. An increasing rig count was fomenting the shale over-production theory.  1. proved a wrong assumption.  2. was ameliorated by rig declines.  IMO.
1859 2018-01-26 19:39:21 Because you dump. To educate you, currency does not affect food. Most of the food we produce it locally.  Currency only affects import such as computers, oil, petrol etc. Out lets such as pick n pay do not adjusy their prices according to currency.
1860 2018-01-26 19:39:21 I see  omo try drink olive oil.
1861 2018-01-26 19:39:16 I agree with this, but this does not account for the ten weeks of gasoline builds
1862 2018-01-26 19:39:04 I used bio oil twice a day while I was pregnant and I didn't get any stretch marks during my entire pregnancy
1863 2018-01-26 19:38:55 U moisturize ur face with coconut oil...
1864 2018-01-26 19:38:52 Having oil on my lashes is the most uncomfortable thing
1865 2018-01-26 19:38:49 @martinkeown5 you're laughable mate. Sanchez a mercenary? Cause picking City wouldn't be about money right? Oil dollars aplenty.  The lad made a career decision - just move on
1866 2018-01-26 19:38:45 It’s obvious we will be in a massive deficit for all of 2018 despite aggressive shale assumptions and that’s discounting any sort of supply disruptions with unplanned outages at multi year highs. We are at the 2011-2015 avg for oil/products in OECD already.
1867 2018-01-26 19:38:42 Not as much as advertised. Talking points being based on income, most people didn't realize how much you had to earn to actually get
 $1,500
1868 2018-01-26 19:38:34 And they use chemicals found in fertilizers, oil and other products within their coffee, I only go into Starbucks for their hot chocolate and that’s it.
1869 2018-01-26 19:38:33 #reckless 
1870 2018-01-26 19:38:27 When I'm in the oil change place, I like to pretend my car is peeing on the guy in the pit below. They don't like when you make the pee noises though.
1871 2018-01-26 19:38:25 Was going to get my oil changed after acupuncture but my naturopath told me go get a good lunch instead so doctors order am I right
1872 2018-01-26 19:38:08 i got $1800 last year and getting chopped to $600 is messing with my plans so hard. how am i supposed to get my oil line replaced when i have to buy a whole new mattress AND frame as well?

1874 2018-01-26 19:37:56 Have you not caught on to the irrevocable fact that Scotland is a separate nation in a Treaty with England, or do you think England made a Treaty with itself? And check the Act of Union, nothing in it allowing a UK prime minister to steal Scotland's oil.
1875 2018-01-26 19:37:50 Negros out here cooking wings in Henny no oil used 
1876 2018-01-26 19:37:38 There is a time limit on that. Anything this old is fine unless it's oil based paint.
1877 2018-01-26 19:37:37 Yay! we're excited for you to receive this fantastic oil. You will have to let us know what you think!
1878 2018-01-26 19:37:33 懐かしくてさいこうに高まりました(^o^)v 奨さんかっこかわいい！
1879 2018-01-26 19:37:32 You’re so wrong.  Sorry.  When the US nationalizes its oil companies like Venezuela did - then you’re right.
1880 2018-01-26 19:37:21 USA alone uses over 19 million barrels of oil per day.....economically unviable industry??

1885 2018-01-26 19:36:27 Do you factor in the poor quality of shale oil?
1886 2018-01-26 19:36:22 I couldn't agree more...all we need off them is nice cheap oil. Theres not one country in middle east that's worth one drop of English blood. 
1887 2018-01-26 19:36:16 Rest easy, look to the North, Oil will be coming in and US will supply World with plenty of oil.
1888 2018-01-26 19:36:14 OMG they DO know that plastic is a by product- practically FREE - from oil, right? What dumb Sh--s!
1889 2018-01-26 19:36:06 Not a damn dime for Alberta oil workers
1890 2018-01-26 19:36:01 Damn Near 1/2 Palm Oil, I'll Pass.
1891 2018-01-26 19:35:52 Today I bought 3 new hair masks, a leave in conditioner and some hair oil and I'm genuinely so excited to use it all, I'm obsessed
1892 2018-01-26 19:35:49 It's valid, whereas the anti climate people believe the propaganda from the likes of big oil. Both wrong.
1893 2018-01-26 19:35:48 the deeper in the hole you go.  Like I said, my conscience is clear.  You are now informed, what you choose to do with it is your responsibility, not mine.
1894 2018-01-26 19:35:44 The people at Havoline are so nice lol I’m glad the guy who changed my oil said he wasn’t a scary dude
1895 2018-01-26 19:35:38 Yep, and leases the rights to drill to BIG OIL, which owns what it pulls out of the sea floor.  Thank you.
1896 2018-01-26 19:35:28 Double figures will be guaranteed on licensing news. We should be trading around 6p based on current oil price alone. Licensing will potentially turn #HYR into a mid cap company.  Not many people realise this, it could be massive.
1897 2018-01-26 19:35:03 The Mid East is having problems.  Saudi Arabia is next to have trouble. Meanwhile, the Alaska and Canadian oil fields will come on strong and supply the world for next 50 years easy.  Cheapest energy will be winner.
1898 2018-01-26 19:35:00 Lol just flamed the standard oil company in my blogs n stuff you should probably check it out and create a moderate to severe protest #yayitsfriyay
1899 2018-01-26 19:34:37 Seriously. "Why didn't you put your mom on a strict regimen of coconut oil?" Um because the evidence suggests that would give her a heart attack and not help. "Why didn't you go to <XYZ expert in far away city>?" Because I'm not rich?
1900 2018-01-26 19:34:35 And with sweet oil

1901 2018-01-26 19:34:34 I used to sit outside with my dad when I was young to watch him work in cars.  I’m sure I can change my own oil but I’ve never attempted. Lol
1902 2018-01-26 19:34:31 Waiting to get my oil change .. about to drink my henny and relax
1903 2018-01-26 19:34:16 Be careful what you are reading because that is the hilariously wrong narrative that drove oil to $42 in the summer. We’re now back to 3 year highs. Whoops.
1904 2018-01-26 19:34:13 Niles, that just sounds like oil wrestling. I don't think I'm ready for that.
1905 2018-01-26 19:34:04 Between rice water washes, castor oil and biotin my hair has grown over an inch in 2 weeks, crazy . ..
1906 2018-01-26 19:33:58 Why is Indiana talking about banning sales of CBD oil in the state? Sounds like law makers know nothing about the helpfulness of CBD.
1907 2018-01-26 19:33:56 Obviously she didn't realize she was pointing out disparate tax treatment of bonuses in a way. 
Libs not really that smart
1908 2018-01-26 19:33:54 It isn't irrelevant to anyone interested in investing in the real world.  It may be irrelevant to your thesis, but that is your thesis, not the real world.  The longer you dismiss reality, or fabricate "reality" to conform to your thesis, instead of the other way around

1914 2018-01-26 19:32:57 WELCOME TO THE FOLD, @CBD_USA . ive actually been thinking to try cbd oil for chronic pain. not jokey "chronic" but real pain stuff
1915 2018-01-26 19:32:54 Other things it could be would be distributor/spark plugs, if the oil ends up being unrelated.
1916 2018-01-26 19:32:52 If olive oil comes from olives, where does baby oil come from?
1917 2018-01-26 19:32:48 hey @dsnaturals @nocow any chance you can make your cookies/products without palm oil? They're my favorite vegan product!
1918 2018-01-26 19:32:32 And speed of shale well depletion is actually going up as fracking gets more aggressive and wells more marginal.

Remaining oil streams are often not economic to exploit, They literally move the rig. So yes, for all intents and purposes the avg well is dry in 18 months.
1919 2018-01-26 19:32:30 Of course, style went out the window in the late 1970's, after the first oil embargo, and the BIG 3 (Ford, GM, Chrysler) had to scramble to make competitive cars to go against Nissan and Toyota, and they were ugly as all get out, and nothing's changed. There's no style anymore.

1923 2018-01-26 19:32:11 Car was running fine.
It’s a whip.
Stoped to get the oil changed at Walmart like a dumbass & they said oil was milked & head gasket was blown.
Both were incorrect.
She’s fine.

1949 2018-01-26 19:28:48 Die BKK #Mobil_oil galt früher im Kollegenkreis als die kostengünstigste. Auch wenn sich das Beitragssystem sich inzwischen geändert hat, wird die Maxime immer noch Kosteneinsparung sein.
1950 2018-01-26 19:28:48 Yes, thanks for asking. Back to my question, what is the point you are making? Sugar or the palm oil?
1951 2018-01-26 19:28:29 It’s like that ‘pizza slice is equivalent of 2 spoons of oil’ tweet. People who don’t cook telling those of us who do to be shocked at nutritional content. 
1952 2018-01-26 19:28:20 going on day 4 of not being able to open a jar of coconut oil and now I truly understand fragile masculinity
1953 2018-01-26 19:28:19 Stewed chicken w/ carrots, mushrooms, potatoes & green beans is on the menu tonight. Chop it all up, toss it in together w/ a little olive oil/water, put the lid on, set heat to low, and do something else for an hour.

1956 2018-01-26 19:28:14 My maintenance required light came on. Doesn’t that mean I got another 7k plus miles before I change the oil??
1957 2018-01-26 19:27:53 Man oil is HUGE there, looks like you have this well thought out lol
1958 2018-01-26 19:27:46 That European reporter is being very humble. Europeans are very aware of the contents of African nations. In fact no entity has capitalized more off of the Diamonds, Cobalt,Gold,Cocoa, Copper,Iron,Petroleum, Silver Uranium, Bauxite Aluminum Salt and Oil than our European friends.
1959 2018-01-26 19:27:28 But overall with products in mind, it's still a build. Seasonal is irrelevant. That's just narrative. And 10+ million bpd in the U.S. is about to smack all you word salad Seeking Alpha trolls......
1960 2018-01-26 19:27:20 Translation: It's only about profits and the overpriced military contracts you and your rich backers make money from. Between them and the oil barons your building quite the nest egg for yourself while you're suppose to be working for all Americans.

1962 2018-01-26 19:27:06 last year US added +29 oil rigs after reducing rig count by -7 the week before.  I wonder if today's jump is more than just price.  +29 was followed by +15, +17.  seasonality??  TX regulations?
1963 2018-01-26 19:27:05 I never know how much coconut oil serum is too much coconut oil serum to put in my hair
1964 2018-01-26 19:26:58 You realize the 4th largest city in the nation (Hint: oil capital of the world) was virtually shut down for an extended period of time due to Hurricane Harvey.

1967 2018-01-26 19:26:22 A really fun habit I can't shake is combining BOEM and oil and just writing BOIL every time I'm writing about offshore drilling.

1972 2018-01-26 19:25:21 It was voted down 41-50.  41 legislators voted in favor of letting people get away with vehicular homicide.  That shows how despicable our country has become.  We have law-makers who are willing to allow humans to be killed just so that oil companies can profit.

1988 2018-01-26 19:22:35 Can you imagine if we stopped using Oil and we started using water power if we grew more trees to help global warming there are so many things we could do these are just tiny things
1989 2018-01-26 19:22:26 Unfortunately, empty cans make the most noise and the squeaky wheel gets the oil.

1996 2018-01-26 19:21:18 If there’s no essential oil for it, is it really a problem?

1999 2018-01-26 19:20:56 I hope so, Peter. But £ has been rising steadily for several months.
The oil companies invarialy are quick to put prices up when it goes down.
Capatalism is under severe attack at present and must avoid own goals.

2000 2018-01-26 19:20:17 Combination of oil prices tripling over night, Nixon ending the Bretton Woods system (in order to discipline the French, who had been taking the piss), and a couple years of strikes resulted from these economic conditions gave

2006 2018-01-26 19:19:09 Yeah don't be afraid to give then shit, completely unacceptable, specially with the prices of oil changes these days let alone if your running full synthetic.

2008 2018-01-26 19:19:02 the only thing I give a damn about in that pic is the palm oil

anyway everyone knows nutella is healthy. it’s got less sugar than jam and less fat than peanut butter!
2009 2018-01-26 19:19:01 Are we shifting the conversation back to oil price ?. Because we could have that as well. Thought you quoted FIRS figures to celebrate IGR.
2010 2018-01-26 19:18:57 You can make your own Nutella. 
3/4 cup of hydrogenated palm oil.
1 cup of powdered sugar.
1/4 cup of cheap cocoa powder. 
1 doz. hazelnuts.
Mix in a blender until smooth.
Same crap, same taste.

2016 2018-01-26 19:17:32 I'm all for American jobs and making the playing field even, but this looks like a direct hit against solar, especially since oil and coal companies are getting a boost at the same time. Sad.
2017 2018-01-26 19:17:22 In a blatant, anti-environment move, Chump decided to name the oil industry’s top lawyer/shill, Jeffrey Bossert Clark,  as the lead DOJ Environment Attorney.

Isn’t that like naming Larry Nassar as the head of Child Protection Services.?

2020 2018-01-26 19:17:11 Until (clean) water, air & oil become global, protected, equal-access resources, protected from privatization, we'll be screwed at every turn. Just as the neoliberals designed it. Their goal is privatization, ours must be, er, publicization!
2021 2018-01-26 19:17:10 Big Oil was granted ridiculously cheap prices by corrupt bribed govt officials for the resources from deep inside the Earth, which technically belongs to all Earthlings. Which is why Big Oil oligarchs are billionaires. This is v unfair. Global poverty needs to be eradicated ASAP.

2025 2018-01-26 19:16:21 I think my resting bitch face got me $5 off of my oil change...then they heard my little voice & looked so confused 
2026 2018-01-26 19:16:16 I brought a book to read while waiting on my car to be done with the oil change, but instead I’ve been watching AHS on Netflix..... oh well I’ve been here for over an hour lmao
2027 2018-01-26 19:16:06 Consider banks like an oil tanker. They have to move slow. Ripple is capable of getting the oil tanker in the right direction, but it will take time. Meanwhile, we have some small and agile ships, who have the guts to create the sea maps... patience is key

2030 2018-01-26 19:15:30 Spouse is French and says the European version uses vegetable oil vs. the imported to American, which uses palm oil. Also, some claim there are more hazelnuts in the original. I'm a fan of experiential wisdom. Side by side tasting of them tells you all you need.

2038 2018-01-26 19:14:34 There is no such thing as substainable palm oil. Ferrero is responsible for the destruction and future extinction of Orangutans.
2039 2018-01-26 19:14:32 What do people outside of @OilersNation think about the GI call on McDavid? (Objectively, if possible). Of course as an Oil fan, I think the call was soft (particularly after that call in the playoffs last year).

Fixed that for you.
2050 2018-01-26 19:12:40 @MaritimeCFL I know that the possibility of using Shannon Park for a stadium is a long shot. Has anyone given thought to approaching imperial oil on the land that the refinery was located in woodside. Maybe you could get it for a great price. Close to ferry, bus and highway.
2051 2018-01-26 19:12:25 If we want here to become there, then keep it up. It's inevitable.
2052 2018-01-26 19:12:13 What does an oil rig fire have to do with infrastructure rebuilding? Nothing. Tell me Americans don`t want better roads & safer bridges. The will not be building oil rigs.

2055 2018-01-26 19:11:55 I think it honestly depends on if you have naturally dry or oily skin on which oil/moisturizer works best for your skin.
2056 2018-01-26 19:11:52 In 2012, yes... Mostly from oil receipts tho 63.93% of 5.07 trillion... Oil prices averaged $111 that year, so? 
2057 2018-01-26 19:11:41 Right. Year over year, products are still down, and they follow a very similar pattern every year. Product inventory is very normal levels, whole crude inventory usually builds but is falling off a cliff instead. Seems we’re not the ones pushing a narrative.
2058 2018-01-26 19:11:39 How can you say it's the Oldest...have you gone round the world...to look for human remains...
2059 2018-01-26 19:11:33 That looks low but not bone dry, but also unacceptable lvl for a fresh oil change, they fucked up

2072 2018-01-26 19:09:55 Face moisturizer gonna take some trial & error lol. For body, adding an oil (neutrogena has a nice 1 but even baby oil works) right after ur bath, before you lotion makes a huge diff. Cetaphil cream is a great option if u have any skin sensitivity that flares up in the winter

2074 2018-01-26 19:09:46 LOL one of her replies is "maybe take up smoking at least there's no oil in cigarettes"
2075 2018-01-26 19:09:44 Agreed. Making the, "when are all things considered equal" argument when all things are *not* equal is foolish. In the world of $5000 gold and $400 oil the US equity market likely resembles the Caracas Stock Exchange and the USD in a death spiral like the Bolivar.
2076 2018-01-26 19:09:27 I don't have the patience for waiting for oil changes and thus I am way over due. Currently waiting in line for a bay at Valvoline anxiously awaiting someone to scold me for waiting so long 
2077 2018-01-26 19:09:26 This Romulan Grapefruit oil smells so good lol
2078 2018-01-26 19:09:26 Lastly, consider type of oil.  Perm and shale is light crude.  Complex requires a mix.  Lots of lite does not "fix" supply problems, without commensurate grades needed in refining market demanded fuels.  Shale is not "energy independence", as it is not diverse like former conv.

2082 2018-01-26 19:09:09 The irritating thing is that the price of Brent crude oil has just passed the $70 mark. Should also go down.
2083 2018-01-26 19:09:02 @Taggart7 @TorrensJonathan Can’t wait to count the number of “oil checks” in this doc! Ouch
2084 2018-01-26 19:09:02 I thought that too but everything turns on it just the engine won’t turn over and there’s not much oil in it.

2088 2018-01-26 19:08:25 dont forget the baby oil wanker
2089 2018-01-26 19:08:22 Those growth rates are impacted by oil prices and big projects. I’m talking about the spending people do every day for food and drink. Somethings changed. They’re being cautious with the pound in their pocket maybe because they weren’t cautious enough with the card in the wallet
2090 2018-01-26 19:08:10 The Sex Robot had an oil leak?
2091 2018-01-26 19:07:58 However, little or no impact may be felt now given d extent of d accumulated damage done to dis Nation. Except u want d man in charge to use magic wand to transform d country. To transit from oil dependent nation to diversed sources calls for a huge patience and resilience.

2098 2018-01-26 19:07:03 Your palm oil point is a good one Rina, but I'm fairly sure they're not Nestlé. As far as I know, Ferrero is family-owned.
2099 2018-01-26 19:06:50 Okay so I’m watching Supervet and this woman has left a tub of coconut oil with her chihuahua saying she likes to have some after breakfast in the morning, I can’t deal with this level of sass

2101 2018-01-26 19:06:45 MCLAIN MURDER: Powers is the first witness to say Fournier didn't seem like himself after the oil truck accident. She describes him as being 'childish' and very dependent on her.
2102 2018-01-26 19:06:43 It’s a jar of palm oil. But yeah!
2103 2018-01-26 19:06:40 I hate when I’m in public and I check my oil in my car and someone comes and asks if everything’s okay.. don’t get me wrong I appreciate it but I got this covered thank you #independent

2156 2018-01-26 19:00:50 why think they would go bankrupt drilling $60 oil, Permian is breakeven at around 42, some pads at under 40, and getting cheaper with tech, pipe lines coming on straight to CC, developing infra of sands & water to reduce those costs, most all frack 2 wells a pad to reduce costs
2157 2018-01-26 19:00:46 In 2001, the revenue coming into Alberta would've been significant with the optimism of future growth ahead. That year oil companies were still conducting exploration programs, 21,000 wells were drilled, price of NatGas was over $5.00
2158 2018-01-26 19:00:46 @johnmcdonnellMP Venezuela wasn't Socialist enough, according to you, which is apparently why their economy is now a basket-case; anybody with half a brain cell knows that the oil industry there is run by government appointees who couldn't run a whelk stall, which is precisely

2167 2018-01-26 18:59:44 @WillCainShow says Brady is better story than LeBron because Brady over came just sooo much adversity, ya know. Because it's tough being friends with snake oil shilling, senile racist presidents.
2168 2018-01-26 18:59:41 Apparently you can fry things without oil. I question the validity of that statement but could maybe get behind crispy things that are not saturated in saturated fat.
2169 2018-01-26 18:59:30 Just saw a clip of the Piers Morgan interview. He asked Trump abt the controversial retweet. Lame response. Insincere as always. Don't buy it UK. It's poison snake oil.

2200 2018-01-26 18:55:32 The fact that I just spent 350$ last month on heating oil and JUST had to pay another 450$ is besides me

2204 2018-01-26 18:54:54 why you been avoiding getting an oil change? 
2205 2018-01-26 18:54:48 You should know that two weeks ago I purchased what was supposed to be two 1000mg Kind Live Resin cartridges & a Kind Live Resin battery from The Nirvana Center. I only recently found out battery they sold me is actually an "Oil Stix" battery, likely why carts ran out so quickly.
2206 2018-01-26 18:54:42 So vape stores in Maryland now carry CBD oil. How is that allowed, they aren't a dispensary.
2207 2018-01-26 18:54:41 This coconut oil got my curls lookin wonderful i appreciate all of those who told me to hop on
2208 2018-01-26 18:54:22 Yes.  But context matters.  The builds reflect seasonal norms, due to refinery turn-around.  They are actually low, considering demand is extremely high compared to norms.  There should be builds in crude, but still drawing.  Gas will draw as turnaround begins, and may  b 2 low!

2257 2018-01-26 18:48:05 That oil won't even be used domestically. It will be shipped out to Asian markets, like China and India, where it fetches a higher price due to rising demand.

2269 2018-01-26 18:45:58 But look at the other end, hired after working for oil, or drug czars in charge of opioid crisis, big bankers in charge of deregulation, anti environmental folks at EPA. Damage done.
2270 2018-01-26 18:45:54 Any car peoples out there wanna help?

I had my oil changed yesterday and I drove to class this morning now my car won’t start it won’t turn over...

When it will for a quick second it shows the oil and engine light.
2271 2018-01-26 18:45:41 All part of Trump's plan to destroy solar and promote coal and oil.
2272 2018-01-26 18:45:39 Pretty sure Nutella is just a joint venture brought to you by the sugar, palm oil and dairy industries.
2273 2018-01-26 18:45:38 WE should raise the rates on water to foreign countries,and gouge them like they gouged America for oil.
2274 2018-01-26 18:45:30 "Local media reports said the dead included Venezuelans and Ukrainians."  I wonder if these Venezuelans were involved in oil and gas deals

2276 2018-01-26 18:45:11 @frostsgardens @MilletsFarm had an awesome time today at the new Sprouts Play Centre although must say cafe food for children is poor.I ordered Fish Goujons & they came as deep fried fish sticks dripping in fried oil, not ideal for a developing body or infact anybody....moan over
2277 2018-01-26 18:45:06 When you bring your car for an oil change, and $600 later there was a ton of work your car needed that you weren’t expecting...
2278 2018-01-26 18:44:58 IEA & EIA may not understand its significance. Most of the staff there have never worked a day in the oil industry. May be more of a blindspot than a blind eye.
2279 2018-01-26 18:44:45 Yes it will. We use tea tree oil in our beard oil to help with that.
2280 2018-01-26 18:44:40 Lemme find out u slick as a can of oil
2281 2018-01-26 18:44:36 Riiiiighhtttt...these product builds you are talking about are seasonal. Year over year, products are down and typically stay in a similar pattern from year to year. There are no huge products increases looking year over year, meanwhile crude inventory year over year is way down
2282 2018-01-26 18:44:25 Nails. Flights. And Coconut oil.
2283 2018-01-26 18:44:18 Florida was victim of Oil spill from neighboring gulf states is the only point that needs to be made. We will not allow it to happen again. If Trump is looking for an uprising he will get it.
2284 2018-01-26 18:44:14 Woah.... you almost threw a rod! Always check your oil and coolant if you don’t check anything
2285 2018-01-26 18:44:14 Our wash and oil help with that. A lot of our customers said they’ve noticed a difference in razor bumps.

2298 2018-01-26 18:41:49 Eliminating safety regulations on oil drilling, banking regs put in place after Bush recession & housing crisis , clean air & water safeguards, building regulations to protect us from hurricanes & other disasters, etc puts our country at unnessary risk!

I'm reading that the price of crude oil has gone above the $70/barrel mark.
2304 2018-01-26 18:40:48 I learned about action potential in AP biology and anatomy so  yesterday’s lecture was a nice review.

2305 2018-01-26 18:40:46 GREAT!

THANKS 4 POISONING THE AIR, WATER, AND SOIL WHERE WE GROW OUR FOOD. 
THANKS 4 THE POTENTIAL OIL SPILLS & OIL RIG EXPLOSIONS THAT I DIDN'T ASK 4 AT MY LOCAL BEACHES!
THANKS 4 REMOVING REGULATIONS THAT PROTECT COAL MINERS, OIL RIG WORKERS & GIVING THEM NO MEANS......
2306 2018-01-26 18:40:31 stop using oil and then they won't have to drill. It's a no-brainer.

2308 2018-01-26 18:40:20 Or, in other words, if humans hadn't discovered coal, oil and natural gas the climate of the Earth wouldn't be changing for the first time in the planet's history?

2313 2018-01-26 18:39:55 They bought deffo more sugar&palm oil than hazelnuts.
2314 2018-01-26 18:39:42 You don’t visibly sweat as if you were running a marathon and shit but everyone picks up dirt/oil while they sleep. On your sheets, pillowcases or pajamas etc
2315 2018-01-26 18:39:19 Actually it lags oil prices up and down. What is interesting though is that we are producing more oil than ever and we are no where near the rig count levels when oil was at $80 before the crash

2319 2018-01-26 18:38:47 Amazing! Terrible news and oil goes up one percent! People really know that shale oil with high API has no market! In June, we would have been -3%...=

2322 2018-01-26 18:38:14 I don't like popcorn, sadly. :( I ended up making an olive oil + blood orange cake and then ate *half* of it in front of the TV. Sigh. Some days you Adult, some days you regress to College Kid.
2323 2018-01-26 18:38:12 Cant wait for the beard oil to be released!! @StonewoodSilk
2324 2018-01-26 18:38:11 5% is prudent - for funds that only grow from financial investments. The LGPF also grows from oil production from state lands. Therefore, it can handle 1% for early education. #WhyNot
2325 2018-01-26 18:38:04 Oil firm, set for weekly gain as weak dollar underpins: HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil prices were firmer on Friday after hitting fresh three-year highs in the previous session, as weakness in the dollar continued to underpin prices with crude on track for a weekly gain.
2326 2018-01-26 18:37:58 Fair enough, although they might argue that that is the only language with which we let them engage us. However, I suspect there are some purists who truly hold a different world view (and, yes, far more snake oil salespeople capitalizing on a willingly ignorant populace!)
2327 2018-01-26 18:37:30 Other "world leaders" are no where near the top of the food chain as Trump. They are ALL (for most part) bought and paid snake oil salesmen.
Trump is among the very FEW legitimate leaders in the world today.
They all are trying to get under his shining light.
2328 2018-01-26 18:37:21 Why did you put large tariff on imported solar panels when you claim you want energy independence? We should be leading the way on alternative energy, but you’re supporting coal, dangerous coastal oil drilling instead.
2329 2018-01-26 18:37:09 I don’t buy Nutella  because of the palm oil, I make my own 
2330 2018-01-26 18:37:05 I have nothing against oil executives. I’m merely pointing out that he’s still acting like one and not a SoS that is in sync with Trump.
2331 2018-01-26 18:36:57 @realDonaldTrump trundled out a load of tired sound bites to an audience that didn't need to hear his #MAGA rhetoric. Just a snake oil salesman masquerading as the president of the United States! #Davos2018

2360 2018-01-26 18:32:12 Dr. Clarke, with such a keen interest in facts and a Ph.D. in chemical engineering, I’d love your thoughts on continuing to install pipelines when we’ve had 17 leaks (that we know of) of 210,000 gal or more of oil or petroleum products from pipelines in the US since 2010.

2401 2018-01-26 18:27:45 We need to figure out how to hold Big Oil FULLY accountable for their crimes! They need to be stripped of their ill-gotten gains (via cheap oil from Earth which belongs to us all). We need to fund clean up of pollution & switchover to clean renewables; & poverty to be eradicated.
2402 2018-01-26 18:27:44 Quite alot of things contain palm oil including cleaning products, cosmetics etc, not just Nutella
2403 2018-01-26 18:27:02 Venezuela: when 90% of your revenue comes from oil that is only viable at $100 per barrel, well their dear leader fucked that up good.
2404 2018-01-26 18:26:46 Amazing most economists never include cost & availability of oil in their models. No wonder the models are wrong! Cost of underlying primary cost affects margins & growth. Peak-demand world will be a lot less productive using lower energy density source. We will adjust poorly.

2414 2018-01-26 18:25:52 Exactly. Added oil revenues provide the tools to do this; yes.

Which means that a unified, unambiguous, articulate #CBL must step up to the plate, grab the abovementioned tools & use ’em in a way that is neither hesitant nor unsustainable.

The dinar crisis is about governance.
2415 2018-01-26 18:25:46 Grilled Eggplant, Tomato and Goat Cheese Recipe vegan & Gluten Free Autumn Lentil & Pumpkin (or Sweet Potato) Stew with Cilantro Oil is also very nice

2423 2018-01-26 18:24:45 When's Canada going to build its wall? You'll be glad to hear that there won't be any oil rigs spoiling your view for your voyage. Gov Scott & the tRump are beasties(no that's not a autocorrect) you haven't gone yet? Or am I remembering wrong.
2424 2018-01-26 18:24:42 yes! phew. yes. i quite agree. he's got those expensive whetstones and the sharpening oil and those polishing cloths and the magnetised strip because he says knife blocks are for amateurs. yes.

2425 2018-01-26 18:24:26 Well the SB in Indianapolis was one of the highest rated SBs by visitors and teams. Everything is within walking distance of Lucas Oil Stadium. Can’t say the same for the other cities.
2426 2018-01-26 18:24:26 I have infiltrated the white supremacists. They smell of cheese, and mayonaisse. They all seem to like "budden's oil" whatever that is, and I think they have a thing for barbecues if the tiki torches are any indiction. Maybe the oil is for the torches? I must continue observing.
2427 2018-01-26 18:24:26 U should mention Louisiana and Alaska have something in common. We’ve both had tremendously devastating oil spills in our waters. The Exxon Valdez and the Deepwater Horizon.
Don’t forget to add Trump is relaxing or eliminating most oil drilling regulations and that U support him

2438 2018-01-26 18:23:35 In 1953 the Oiligarchy and CIA removed the president of Iran Mohamed Mossadeg because he wanted Iranians to benefit from their own oil.They made a very reasonable offer to BP and BP decided it was time for him to go. So anothemanufactured protest was engineered and rest history

2440 2018-01-26 18:23:21 FOR ANYONE WHOS GOING WTF IS A CRONUT

2446 2018-01-26 18:22:29 Try lemon oil or aloe Vera gel to lighten them. But I have coconut oil, I like it for my hair... but nothing makes me more glowy than baby oil gel on wet skin & then air drying. You won’t have to moisturize til your next shower!

2449 2018-01-26 18:22:02 FAKE NEWS!!!! Solar does NOT employ more people.than oil. FAKE NEWS!!
2450 2018-01-26 18:21:41 Oil/coal have gone the way of the dinosaur,  literally! Trump is slitting the Americans throats by imposing huge tariffs on the solar industry!
2451 2018-01-26 18:21:35 Wait. What? Notley denied benefits? She’s only been Premier for two! I’m sorry for your plight, but blaming the government, and the party that brought us Universal Healthcare just doesn’t add up. Plus you realize they have no control over oil prices.

2462 2018-01-26 18:20:09 Yeah, I remember that. Getting your windshield washed and oil checked, while the gas was going in. You could almost get from Seattle to Portland on $2.50, and *free* maps, too! #goodtimes

2464 2018-01-26 18:19:58 Recall that one of Trump's first real actions in office -  at the behest of a GOP-controlled Congress - was to repeal transparency rules that would require oil companies to publish their payments to governments. 

Corruption in the oil industry is deeply connected to politics.

2467 2018-01-26 18:19:43 Rex has concerned me for a long time.  I see an oil executive doing what oil executives do, not a Sec of State looking out for America and her true allies interests.
2468 2018-01-26 18:19:29 After opening - straight to the fridge! 
Hot sauce, vinegar, and oil excepted.

2470 2018-01-26 18:19:26 #ImNoFanOfTrumpBut those of you that voted for him (especially in red states) liked the way he talked and said we weren't listening to you. Most of us (3 million more than you folks) saw thru his snake oil salesman pitch. The rest of us have had to live with YOUR mistake!!!
2471 2018-01-26 18:19:26 V Fox also did not create a crime free, drug free, cartel free, gun-running free, human trafficking free, and kidnapping free Mexico. Today, Mexico is more dangerous than Syria. Can you imagine that? Heads hang from bridges. Beyond drugs they hijack oil these days. TERRIBLE.

2478 2018-01-26 18:18:57 Davos is now talking pre med after the much ballyhooed discussions about opec oil prices and how oil is supplanting all the talk on wall street. Oil Oil Oi.l.
2479 2018-01-26 18:18:26 I RAN OUT OF COCONUT OIL SO IM JUST GOING TO SHAVE MY HEAD NOW. IM DEAD SERIOUS.
2480 2018-01-26 18:18:23 The only truly bad thing about this is that eating palm oil kills orangutans @DrBirute
2481 2018-01-26 18:18:18 The “political” grift-parasite economy needs to die, along with the oil & gas, advertising, & for-profit “health” “care” industries.
2482 2018-01-26 18:18:00 Yeah went in for an oil change they forgot to but the plug back in and all the oil dripped out and blew up my engine 3000$ fix thanks @jiffylube also your employees broke my fucking glove box
2483 2018-01-26 18:17:59 Pretty sure I could have figured out how to change my oil faster at home. I did my old car in like 20 minutes. This is ridiculous
2484 2018-01-26 18:17:49 Change that to ”snake oil salesman-in-cheif” and you’d be correct.
2485 2018-01-26 18:17:33 Can't have snake oil salesmen without people dumb/lazy enough to be snake oil buyers.
2486 2018-01-26 18:17:23 And this the “populists” get fooled again and the rich win forever no matter the cost
2487 2018-01-26 18:17:22 She also learned how to check the oil in her car.
2488 2018-01-26 18:17:18 Sometimes I will get a “smell” for a specific essential oil. The very same way people may get a taste for a certain food. This is one of the ways my intuitive gifts guide me to work with a certain plant on that day.  I always trust it will be exactly what I need.
2489 2018-01-26 18:17:02 Getting my phone fixed, got a haircut and my oil changed, feelsgoodman
2490 2018-01-26 18:17:01 I got my oil changed and I got a haircut and it’s only 10. I feel accomplished lol now I’m gonna chill until I start work .
2491 2018-01-26 18:16:55 If this were an indigenous group asserting title and seeking to protect the environment against oil pipelines, would you support them?
2492 2018-01-26 18:16:50 @curryhondaga why do recommend customers make appointment?  Clearly out time is not valued.   Had a 1045 appt for a basic oil change. It's now 1:15pm and I'm  still here. Totally unacceptable
2493 2018-01-26 18:16:47 Antalet aktiva olje- och gasriggar i USA ökade med 11 stycken till 947 (årsskiftet 929) den senaste veckan enligt Baker Hughes #OOTT #oil
2494 2018-01-26 18:16:36 c firma is unreal!! I also started using their new polypeptide moisturiser and their night serum a couple weeks ago as well and my skin is thriving already. i’ve also heard good things about the marula oil but haven’t tried yet
2495 2018-01-26 18:16:25 Great...another state to have to clean up oil spills...
2496 2018-01-26 18:16:22 Sugar is startling. But it’s the palm oil that’s really causing the problems.
But if I could still eat dairy, my word I’d be tempted
2497 2018-01-26 18:16:14 Then he just opened the door for oil rigs off his coast. Sorry for the NC tour trade. Sorry for the econ, sorry for the environment.

2499 2018-01-26 18:15:57 I second the B complex vitamins. Those really helped when I was able to afford all the vitamins I used to take. I would take a prenatal vitamin, b-complex (energy), vitamin d (s.a.d./depression), evening primrose (skin), salmon oil (omegas), and co-q10 (cholesterol).
Watch for b-
2500 2018-01-26 18:15:54 It won't be oil the world fights over; it'll be WATER.

2533 2018-01-26 18:12:48 Either way. It'll be interesting to see what the next 500, or even 100 years, brings our society and planet.

2685 2018-01-26 17:56:20 At least at the time, we did. I'm sure it's changed a bit. But despite being shown hard facts that clearly showed where it came from and the percentages, people still claimed we get the majority of oil from Iraq and thus we were there for oil. It was such a lesson
2686 2018-01-26 17:56:14 Turns out global warming is good for the oil biz.  No wonder Trump is trying to sink solar.  #tariffs

2701 2018-01-26 17:54:47 Ali, you seem like a very intelligent person so let me pause a question to you: if the economy is booming mainly due to environmental deregulations which allow coal, oil, gas and petrochemical companies to avoid best environmental practices, how is that not a wash?

2703 2018-01-26 17:54:42 Our liberal professor told us if we truly believe that to get out.  She showed us the chart of US oil imports and we get less than 13% of our oil from Iraq. We get the majority from Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Nigeria and Kenya.

2710 2018-01-26 17:53:08 Definitely recommend using the oil after drying off from the shower. Your pores are more open than any other time, therefore the oil is absorbed quicker.
2711 2018-01-26 17:53:02 Shurmur said when the Vikings improved their o-line last offseason: "We didn't change the oil, we changed the transmission." That made Dave Gettleman and the Giants as happy as a hog mollie in, well, you know.
2712 2018-01-26 17:53:01 This damn oil and filter costs $55, as soon as I start saving good something comes up that involves me spending money:( story of my life.
2713 2018-01-26 17:53:00 Now, bias is bad on every side, absolutely, but a lot of it is outright refusal to hear options thst differ from your own beliefs regardless of facts.  When I was in college it was during the war in Iraq and people kept claiming we were in Iraq for oil.
2714 2018-01-26 17:52:52 Once you stop buying oil and put sanctions on Cabello, things might start working.
2715 2018-01-26 17:52:50 This was intended. Solar industry doesn't have as powerful lobbyists as oil or coal.

2726 2018-01-26 17:50:37 That it plays such a part, through containing palm oil, on habitat destruction turns it to ashes in my mouth. Yes, I know many other products contain it, but to me, Nutella you are dead.

2745 2018-01-26 17:48:46 Don't let a little oil put you off - natural (read: non-homogenized) peanut butter does the same thing.

2768 2018-01-26 17:45:57 The weaker dollar will add over 200b to the trade deficit next year. That will reduce GDP by over 1%. Also higher oil and higher rates will slow consumer spending. No one is talking about it. 
Lastly, is it possible increased debt in Q4 was millenials buying bitcoin?
2769 2018-01-26 17:45:52 if one takes a look at the FAO palm oil figures for the last 20 years, you will also get an idea of how devastating to the planet has been the switch from animal fats to vegetable oils. It has been catastrophic for the rainforests. A very, very destructive unforeseen consequence!

2823 2018-01-26 17:39:04 Few things make me feel more shameful than telling the man at the car shop that I'm 4,000 miles over my scheduled oil change
2824 2018-01-26 17:38:37 Somehow it’s working though  ok baby oil it is
2825 2018-01-26 17:38:33 That's very rude of them but I bet there's a story behind it. Like 3 years a homeless guy changed the oil on his moped in there or something.
2826 2018-01-26 17:38:10 I hope the Jewish community see it as an insult. I'm not of the belief that a liberal jew would enjoy bombing, slaughtering those in lands of oil.
2827 2018-01-26 17:38:04 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
2828 2018-01-26 17:37:54 Coconut oil isn’t easily absorbed by the skin. Try baby oil gel or shea butter!
2829 2018-01-26 17:37:50 more TWBB/Oil trivia -- Doheny and Fall were miners and pals in their 20s in southern New Mexico.
2830 2018-01-26 17:37:44 Well done! Can't stand that smake oil salesman.
2831 2018-01-26 17:37:44 Oh and if you're not using an oil cleanser. START. I also use mine to shave my legs—so much better than shaving cream. And with that, I'll shut up.
2832 2018-01-26 17:37:40 I come from the oil industry, which has its own very special, decades-dated brand of sexual harassment (stereotyping based on gender; elevator ass grabs; bias when it comes to giving promotions, etc.)

But these recent disclosures from tech company employees are next-level effed.
2833 2018-01-26 17:37:28 1072 12:15p 12oz peas, 12oz spinach, 1oz sesame oil, 6 fried eggs, bio salud.
2834 2018-01-26 17:37:16 My Nonno died at 92, he ate lots of pasta, olive oil, walnuts, sardines, anchovies, some fried veal and fish, olives, homemade sauce and bread, lots of cheese, beans and rabbit. He was overweight but never had heart issues, had a working mind and died quietly in his sleep.
2835 2018-01-26 17:37:11 So we are too wee too poor and too stupid to have #indy
Most of our exports are to UK ...Well not true now
Oil prices are well down And no more oil ..Well not true now 
Cannot grow Scotland enough to cope ...Well that reason is gone 
Achieving that on greatly reduced budget 
NEXT
2836 2018-01-26 17:37:10 Essential oils. Such as olive oil, castor oil, coconut oil, glycerine and a bunch of others. I forgot.  They'll revive it.
2837 2018-01-26 17:37:02 Once they rioted bc the palm oil tarif was going to increase and affect the price of Nutella
2838 2018-01-26 17:36:54 The level of stupidity in Talib’s statement and most of his statements is off the charts. He can’t see past his emotions and feelings to look at facts. He’s a fraud and a fake... a snake oil salesman.
2839 2018-01-26 17:36:48 Olive oil is pretty expensive. I am shocked.
2840 2018-01-26 17:36:43 Olive oil if you’re spunky!
2841 2018-01-26 17:36:38 Who trynna come w me to get my oil changed? 
2842 2018-01-26 17:36:29 Canny stand this man but I’ve got to agree with him that our oil revenues were wasted but Labour never done anything to change what was happening
2843 2018-01-26 17:36:23 Proud of our #Princess  #Reema “don’t look at us as #oil, Human capital is the new currency of #Saudi #Arabia”
2844 2018-01-26 17:36:08 Fin de Semana...

2845 2018-01-26 17:36:02 Y you was there did you exchange some of your Russian money for gold or for stock in Russia oil wells
2846 2018-01-26 17:36:01 Easy. He plays McDavid lots and lots. That’s a positive in my book
2847 2018-01-26 17:36:00 i had an inexplicable bout of tinnitis this morning so i put a couple drops of homeopathic garlic oil in my ear to help, and now my earbuds smell like papa johns garlic dipping sauce
2848 2018-01-26 17:35:55 めっちゃねむい。。。洗濯機殿早く、、、
2849 2018-01-26 17:35:47 I feel like I could use a gallon of coconut oil. Everything is so. Dry. 
2850 2018-01-26 17:35:43 Stir it constantly. If desired remove excessive oil. Add fresh coriander and butter. Stir fry and serve
2851 2018-01-26 17:35:31 The CIA has done more to endanger American lives than protect them. Noam Chomsky,  Mike Parenti and Allan Nairn have some examples but Why? Put simply; corporate greed."our oil" is under Iraq's soil, 'our copper" is inside Chile's borders, and so on. We COULD just purchase it.
2852 2018-01-26 17:35:19 Car was making a weird noise...took it to the dealer cause I needed an oil change and my tires rotated anyway.
2853 2018-01-26 17:35:17 I think the oil trap was epic!  
2854 2018-01-26 17:35:15 Nothing to cheer about, past experience has showed that the more oil money govt gets, the more brazen govt thieves become and the poorer Nigerian people become, simply nothing to show for the past oil booms
2855 2018-01-26 17:35:10 Once again youre assuming, you dont know shit about what is going on behind closed doors. Stop being so reactionary and support the damn club. Like it or not, not every club can have Russian or Arab oil money, sometimes teams must be built and not bought
2856 2018-01-26 17:35:09 Deloitte projects a reduction in the price gap between #Canadian and U.S crude #oil in 2018
2857 2018-01-26 17:35:09 getting my oil changed and the guy convinced me to get the expensive one i am so weak to suggestion lmao
2858 2018-01-26 17:35:04 (Chicken 10 minutes, Goat / Lamb / Beef 45 minutes).
Separately heat ½ cup oil and add tomatoes. Cook on low heat until soft (5-6 minutes). Stir periodically.
Add cooked tomatoes and green chillies to the cooked meat. On medium heat stir-fry meat until oil separates from masala
2859 2018-01-26 17:34:42 When you go in for an oil change and leave with a $300 bill for 102736291 other random things
2860 2018-01-26 17:34:27 To make chicken karahai:
Mix garlic, ginger paste and Shan Karahi Mix. Apply to meat and marinate for (Chicken 15 minutes, Goat/ Lamb/ Beef 1-2 hours +).
Heat one cup oil and stir fry meat on high heat for 5-6 minutes. Add ginger. Cover and cook on low heat until meat is tender

#NOLA #gumboclass
2862 2018-01-26 17:34:09 @S_HastingsSimon would be nice if @Pembina @Glen4Climate turned its attention to the little east coast NL petrostate once and a while, a province with a growing offshore oil sector (growing GHG emissions relatively speaking) and chronic foot dragging on climate policy
2863 2018-01-26 17:34:04 Its in Indy, we were in Dallas last time we played y'all. Plus ive been wanting to go to Lucas Oil
2864 2018-01-26 17:33:56 Goes to get a oil change.... finds out I  have a nail in my tire it’s fine 
2865 2018-01-26 17:33:54 I know everyone calls my math teacher awkward but he's pretty fricken great lol
2866 2018-01-26 17:33:46 Not only did Trumps oil barron billionaire donors get huge tax cuts, but they’re raising prices at the pump at the same time. Cool
2867 2018-01-26 17:33:30 DJT would stand on 5th ave & shoot at solar panels to support the coal and oil industries; yelling climate change is fake news
2868 2018-01-26 17:33:23 I spilled almost all of my bottle of rosehip oil last night and I can already feel myself getting weaker 
2869 2018-01-26 17:33:22 Pep boys on north gate always been trash. 3 to 4 hrs for a fukn oil change. Lmaoooo sike
2870 2018-01-26 17:33:17 Great letter .  Justice is all about himself and his coal and oil buddies .

2872 2018-01-26 17:33:03 Retweeted Fact (@Fact):

Coffee is the second most traded commodity on Earth after oil.
2873 2018-01-26 17:32:59 Is ko wo bhi naai aata :P :P :P
Is se pocho k pehlay egg toorte hain ya oil dalte hain pan pe.
2874 2018-01-26 17:32:54 getting an oil change means being the only girl in the lobby at the place
2875 2018-01-26 17:32:52 Are you so myopic? Of course oil & gas are important, but where does the revenue end up?
2876 2018-01-26 17:32:52 I fucking hate when I go to get my oil changed and the guys are like “oh you need this this and this. It’ll only cost a little extra” muhfucker. I came here for an oil change. And only an oil change. You ain’t collecting your coins from me today.
2877 2018-01-26 17:32:51 shit! my home was destroyed, its all black and disgusting! Stupid oil spill! I can barely breathe in here. Humans are so inconsiderate
2878 2018-01-26 17:32:44 For APC the only natural resources in Nigeria is oil and gas in Niger Delter region. Ndi ara.
2879 2018-01-26 17:32:35 Tariffs on over 1,000 items already. Obama tariffed  steel at up to 130% from several countries, one ex. You go wild when that happened?
2880 2018-01-26 17:32:20 Challenge for you, Arin. One tweet about something, anything McLellan does that isn't terrible. Doesn'tbhave to the full 280 characters.
2881 2018-01-26 17:31:53 Extr oil income to be invested on frastructure. Says Buhari
2882 2018-01-26 17:31:52 OIL DIFF: 4.41 -> 4.48

2884 2018-01-26 17:31:29 We put almost every cheese in VEGETABLE OIL and fried it in a pan lololol
2885 2018-01-26 17:31:24 Im sure JFK was just like "Oh those Iraqis deserve the profit from their own oil. Fugheddaboutit. Leave them alone you evil CIA!"
2886 2018-01-26 17:31:04 the fact that it says the hair and makeup team rush to dab herbal oil on them has got to be one of the the most bougiee lol

2888 2018-01-26 17:30:39 Using cuticle oil softens cuticles and prevents them from peeling and bleeding.
2889 2018-01-26 17:30:39 Like the U.S. on Black Friday! I guess these people don't care Nutella is very destructive! #PalmOil #EnvironmentalDevestation Take Palm Oil out of Nutella, Peanut butter, Almond butter....
2890 2018-01-26 17:30:37 You're just angry because I just killed your narrative pushing. You were pushing the whole "draws" BS, then I correctly pointed out that with the products build, we are not seeing these great draws you're bloating about (narrative pushing).
2891 2018-01-26 17:30:36 You seen nothing yet. Idiotic OPEC is prompting more frakking and the oil sands are full steam ahead. 2015/16 glut times 10 in the making.

Oil is a commodity. commidity are cheap by definetion Cryptos will correct the market, in due time.
2892 2018-01-26 17:30:21 Pakistan is poor country .they take money and Oil from Saudi Arabia 
and they get free Wahhabism . that is a package deal .
Fix Sauda Arabia .95% of terrorism  will disappear  from the world .
9/11 hijackers came from Saudi remember .POTUS was sen dancing with them .
shame
2893 2018-01-26 17:30:20 Just poured Oros into a pan thinking I’m pouring oil  Am so absent minded
2894 2018-01-26 17:30:08 Coffee is the second most traded commodity on Earth after oil.
2895 2018-01-26 17:30:01 Cust: I don't want to get the flu. What should I get?
Me: A flu shot.
C: Are you KIDDING? You work in a  vitamin store and are telling me to get a flu shot?!
M: I'm not here to sell you snake oil. If you don't want the flu, get a shot. Otherwise, we have many placebos available.
2896 2018-01-26 17:29:59 Oil is due for a pull back, but I don't expect a deep crash
2897 2018-01-26 17:29:49 VanAuken: US military oversaw the evacuation of some 4,000 ISIS fighters from the Raqqa city so that they could be deployed against Syrian government troops advancing on the country’s main oil fields.
2898 2018-01-26 17:29:33 In 2020 we will.  Sending @sendavidperdue packing to his fabulous Sea Island home where he can watch oil rigs being erected offshore thanks to him s pals @realDonaldTrump and @SecretaryZinke. 

@PamParker7
2899 2018-01-26 17:29:31 Drop in exchange rates means more U.S exports, greater GDP since it's based on value in domestic $ not currency adjusted $.
2900 2018-01-26 17:29:26 Lunch is cooked green lentils and baked potatoes in the same bowl, topped with cayenne-infused olive oil and soy sauce, because i am a lazy and cheap vegetarian.
2901 2018-01-26 17:29:24 Just like oil and gas work ?  Don't want that either ?  Everybody on welfare ?
2902 2018-01-26 17:29:06 This is I think for olives not olive oil.
2903 2018-01-26 17:29:02 It will be doing us any oil & is about to SKYROCKET --- again.
2904 2018-01-26 17:29:01 But didn’t the CPR just announce the other day they are no longer going to transport oil and oil products as if 2020?
2905 2018-01-26 17:28:58 Or just put a few drops in water and drink it or add a few drops to some oil before oil pulling
2906 2018-01-26 17:28:50 when green day comes on while you’re getting an oil change and you immediately take out your headphones
2907 2018-01-26 17:28:49 They want it up as the oil prices go north too...smh
2908 2018-01-26 17:28:38 Stewed artichokes and potatoes in fried (just a little bit) chopped garlic and olive oil - Remember to leave the artichokes in water and lemon before putting them into the pot). Come to Bologna IT You are invited for dinner 
2909 2018-01-26 17:28:33 Yes, it would benefit the US. More oil=less expensive
2910 2018-01-26 17:28:20 Citronella oil in your lotion. Twice a day. You won't smell pretty but it's the only way.
2911 2018-01-26 17:28:15 Yup is only clean oil when they can get it half price then ship it on a billionaires railroad and sell for a major profit!
2912 2018-01-26 17:28:14 OPEC won't be able to keep oil prices high.
2913 2018-01-26 17:28:14 Big move....right!  Oil up, 10 year up, USD down and Au down!  This isn't going to end well for these "cheerleaders!"

BTW: I've followed you for many years and soon will reap the rewards of owning physical that will be way past Pluto!

2958 2018-01-26 17:27:41 Please be careful as peppermint oil can raise blood pressure and lower heart rate.  Found out via personal experience.
2959 2018-01-26 17:27:36 There was a preapproved list and we had to choose out of it. So only energy-connected and only some bullshit they wanted.
Originally I had that great idea to research impact of oil projects on indigenous peoples (Amazon or Arctic), but “никому не интересны твои коренные народы”
2960 2018-01-26 17:27:22 What will now happen to these kegs of groundnut oil???
2961 2018-01-26 17:27:22 The CIA has been chipping away at Venezuela's economy for some time, the Gov doesn't want Chavez's Socialism to ever get back to the way it was before he died, & they have oil, all the excuse needed for us to force regime change.
2962 2018-01-26 17:27:16 India is largest producers of fresh fruits, milk, pulses and oil seeds, sunflower seeds and second largest producer of wheat, rice, sugarcane, potato, tea, cotton etc., in the world. #ProudIndianClub
2963 2018-01-26 17:27:13 Please tell me it wasn't just an oil change that you paid for
2964 2018-01-26 17:27:07 Bankers are looking for #11BPS but no sign from IBA. @arunjaitley and @PMOIndia Pls look into the matter as lakhs of bankers put everything to execute all Govt schemes and did tremendous Job. Bankers burn mid night oil to make sucess of these scheme. Now time to pay back. 11BPS
2965 2018-01-26 17:26:54 @LorneFirkus What if we apologized for using our own oil.....and not using our own oil?
2966 2018-01-26 17:26:44 I’ve had three patients with homeopathic essential oil loving mothers this morning and now I smell like eucalyptus and mint.
2967 2018-01-26 17:26:40 I think this goes back to what happened with Anaheim in the playoffs and demonstrates to the young Oilers that the coach has your back
2968 2018-01-26 17:26:39 I actually just wasted 2 hours going to 5 different shops trying to get my oil changed:)
2969 2018-01-26 17:26:30 this is very utopian viewpoint. The total crude US consumes per year vs what we produce - still a big gap.
2970 2018-01-26 17:26:25 I bet Trump is in Davos just sucking up to all the real billionaires.
2971 2018-01-26 17:26:19 Two vegans talking in the office about how Canola Oil is deadly for you... You know what else is deadly for you? HEARING THIS SHIT
2972 2018-01-26 17:26:12 Absurd behaviour. This stuff is made from the  cheapest of ingredients to mimic chocolate: mostly saturated fat (palm oil) and sugar
2973 2018-01-26 17:26:09 As her folks drive away, her dad yells, "Check the oil!"
2974 2018-01-26 17:25:45 applied coconut oil to my lashes to thicken them bitches but i got some jn my eyes so now im half blind
2975 2018-01-26 17:25:41 And that sign you hold on the corner, the ink used to make that sign was made with oil. And the shoes your wearing while protesting, made with oil!! rant over lol #oilsupportedmyfamilyfor2oyears
2976 2018-01-26 17:25:38 I hate when auto zone employees act like master mechanics with 10,000 hours of experience. Like shut up and get my oil filter
2977 2018-01-26 17:25:32 Do you find palm oil more repulsive than olive oil?
2978 2018-01-26 17:25:30 Yes, draws.  Total liquids are massively drawn down.  Gas builds are the refiners trying to get enough stock to facilitate a turn-around, which MUST be done, by law.  As the demand is so high, if these gas builds didn't happen they could not turn-around.
2979 2018-01-26 17:25:15 a drop of coconut oil costs more than the entire 60-eggs in a packet.
2980 2018-01-26 17:25:07 Sure but it won't be oil!
2981 2018-01-26 17:25:06 #FridayFitness: Tame tension headaches by rubbing peppermint oil, Tiger Balm, or white flower oil into your temples. All three remedies contain menthol, which has analgesic properties. A quick and easy fix to stress, even in the workplace!
2982 2018-01-26 17:24:57 The regulations are meant to protect us of which you are not ! The @GOP are protecting cooperates thatare in the oil gas mining industry! You are denying climate change ! Your colleges loan programs are ripping off students . So stop 
2983 2018-01-26 17:24:53 You are delusional. You accuse everyone of being tsxnan whoever that is, and you’ve been wrong on oil for 5 months now. I’m sure that blue arrow is coming any time now though... lol
2984 2018-01-26 17:24:50 In the end it’s against NA be the same for the oil change. I can do the wipers myself tho
2985 2018-01-26 17:24:43 the basic idea of NOT removing all your oil because it's better for you is so key and real and true
2986 2018-01-26 17:24:41 You can turn a corner and bam there that person is.  Also if I lived close to you I Would love to oil you up and down.
2987 2018-01-26 17:24:27 It's a pleasure to connect!  
Nice! I occasionally do some surreal acrylic paintings, myself, though I haven't yet done much with oil. Maybe one day! Looking forward to seeing more of your art in my newsfeed. 
2988 2018-01-26 17:24:23 tea tree oil really works wonders
2989 2018-01-26 17:24:16 First try with the air fryer - broccoli, salt, 2 tsp olive oil

Air fryer addiction: Confirmed
2990 2018-01-26 17:24:14 ahh, oil change and wipers do them at home save yourself a bit  ;)
2991 2018-01-26 17:24:00 Lots of wind and solar But lots of oil production 

"Were all the oil and gas produced each year in California to be burned, it would emit roughly ninety million metric tons of carbon dioxide."
2992 2018-01-26 17:23:49 it MIGHT be worth trying oil cleanser am AND pm and using the toner am

2994 2018-01-26 17:23:37 Small shit. Oil change. New wipers and my whisper pump for the fluid isn’t working
2995 2018-01-26 17:23:27 Goes well with snake oil.
2996 2018-01-26 17:23:20 I’m defo ordering tonight too, chilli oil defo essential though my guy looooool
2997 2018-01-26 17:23:15 Removed 36% more illegal criminals, religious freedom is FREE again (unlike under O—making nuns pass out condoms…?)  killed Obama’s Clean Power Plan, opened up oil drilling, keystone pipeline opened, economic confidence at a 17 year high, fixing crumbling military equipment...
2998 2018-01-26 17:23:14 My dad got 3 girls and we didn’t get the benefit of escaping anything. He made us learn to change our oil, change a tire and kill bugs instead of waking him up in the middle of the night to do so
2999 2018-01-26 17:23:05 The world probably know how sad i am, my pain like water and oil that can't be mixed, only above the surface of the water, when i breath the interest end. For the kids inside this lonely ocean.  I want yo tell them too

3001 2018-01-26 17:23:02 LOL heard that!!! Except they weren’t  but they were a close second! Have you ever had those boulder canyon avocado oil ones?!
3002 2018-01-26 17:23:02 Happy birthday @sunita_nolan. I still remember when u would dip your bread in that hot oil wax candle your parents had in the kitchen. 
3003 2018-01-26 17:22:59 Continued- BTW the phone, laptop, computer, or tablet you used to complain on social  media was made with oil dip shit!! If you're so against oil I suggest you buy a horse also, because that car you drive is made with oil also!!
3004 2018-01-26 17:22:52 The oil from the oil producing states should be used to develop the oil producing states and not north as you directed the world bank.

3006 2018-01-26 17:22:46 store bought. currently burts bees which is argan and coconut. I *think* my issue at root is that oil cleansing along is perfect for my skin BUT i have hormonal acne too.
3007 2018-01-26 17:22:28 Do you mean new investment in renewables to offset oil economy decline?  Or what new investment?  Welcoming Saudi Aramco and using Russian steel pipelines to reach Russian-defaulted Venezuelan Citgo in Houston, to await #DoomsdayClock disasters predicted by @Columbia @ProPublica?
3008 2018-01-26 17:22:27 Came home to bagong palit na bedsheet and bagong oil sa humidifier and it  makes me question why I have to leave home for work. #ThanksMa

3011 2018-01-26 17:22:02 You wants Torts, maybe?
3012 2018-01-26 17:21:44 Ate Nutella years ago before it had mass market appeal and became trendy. Don't anymore, because of changes to ingredients -> palm oil + additives.
3013 2018-01-26 17:21:37 He's making International Policy ABOUT HIMSELF, not about the interests of the US. Do Americans still believe they live in a Democracy?

3018 2018-01-26 17:21:23 I use coconut oil but never tried when my skin still wet I’ll try it

3020 2018-01-26 17:21:14 Nutella, which is a product using palm oil, causing severe deforestation...
3021 2018-01-26 17:21:05 It is and you’ll pardon me, DVine. Watching the snake oil salesmen move into the space claiming expertise while knowing they possess none. This has been a wonderful educational journey for me. What a time to be alive.
3022 2018-01-26 17:21:00 just like oil on my hands, hooooooooooooooonor to love you
3023 2018-01-26 17:20:57 I hate it when I try to cook food on a pan, & the food sticks to the pan (even with oil)
3024 2018-01-26 17:20:44 I have a dedicated bathtub full of virgin olive oil I soak in for about 3/4 hours a week! Really tough to get out of but it keeps my skin clear and soft!
3025 2018-01-26 17:20:37 I’m just waiting on my soulmate to walk into my life with a Cajun filet biscuit and a bottle of spartan beard oil
3026 2018-01-26 17:20:34 Roasted asparagus with fresh lemon and garlic, a little drizzle of olive oil. So so good.
3027 2018-01-26 17:20:33 U loss to the Sabres & Oil #hmmm
3028 2018-01-26 17:20:30 mine is very combination and it depends on the season. Just oil cleansing seemed fine in the summer when I'm oily. but now I'm dry + acne so it's delicate
3029 2018-01-26 17:20:26 It contains palm oil which, if I am correct isn't very good for you in the long term - they are bit nutty in France over this chocolate goo !
3030 2018-01-26 17:20:17 It's truly disgusting how our govt allows this...oil spill contamination....nuclear waste dumped in rivers n oceans...its not just in poor areas its everywhere 
3031 2018-01-26 17:19:53 Just finished watching Appetite for Destruction by @DorganMichael 
Great movie! Gave me a ton of insight on palm oil development in the Americas and Africa! #MoreSustainableFood
3032 2018-01-26 17:19:49 Exactly, economy might thrive now, but left behind while the world continues.

Trump must know that oil investment will start falling 2020 when investment from WBO stops.
3033 2018-01-26 17:19:45 From what I understand it’s the oil resistant coating that scratches. I have multiple hair thin scratches all over my X after 2 month :(
3034 2018-01-26 17:19:24 He and that administration were sorely unprepared to go into a war in the ME and topple Saddam, a ME stabilizer. I believe Cheney had more sinister motives (oil) but they were clueless. I said to colleagues before it started that it would be like taking a bat to a hornets nest.
3035 2018-01-26 17:19:15 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
3036 2018-01-26 17:19:09 I boiled 1.5 cups water with salt and few drops of oil. Then added 1.5 cups rice flour and mixed well. Cover and rest for min 20 minutes, Knead again, shape and roll into rotis. While cooking each roti, i have smeared top with water so that the surface doesnt dry out.
3037 2018-01-26 17:19:04 That might not have been fish oil buddy.....
3038 2018-01-26 17:18:49 Daniel Yergin, the oil historian, summarized what many said in private in #Davos2018: "The combination of strong economic growth and cheap money is lifting #commodities"
3039 2018-01-26 17:18:48 I used bio oil throughout my pregnancy and had no stretch marks at all throughout 
3040 2018-01-26 17:18:34 Their thingy dabbed in motor oil wedged into their kitty

3042 2018-01-26 17:18:18 Today I dropped and shattered a bottle of olive oil in the grocery store and I couldn’t even remember how to say “I’m sorry” in Italian... happy Friday 
3043 2018-01-26 17:18:18 I’ve never made or used butter cause it seems much harder to make. I think I’m gonna use this on garlic bread! The olive oil will be great brushed on with added spices.
3044 2018-01-26 17:18:14 I love coconut oil. My hair is so soft 
3045 2018-01-26 17:18:13 Girl yess MAJOR KEY!! Even with shaving of the vaj lol shave, moisture the kitty with coconut oil (on the lower region the bikini line) while wet and it feels like a wax thank me later
3046 2018-01-26 17:18:05 Stock draws? Ten weeks of gas builds, forgot?
3047 2018-01-26 17:17:46 And not for coal and oil.
3048 2018-01-26 17:17:41 Good on you pulling a win
3049 2018-01-26 17:17:17 What if they used peanut oil
3050 2018-01-26 17:17:14 Mr Becerra, with ALL the problems we have in CA you start wasting time suing oil companies? Are you looking for $$$ for yourself?
Concentrate in bringing companies INTO the state & not OUT!!! We lost already lots of jobs ...

#MAGA2018
3051 2018-01-26 17:17:14 Yeah I’m still skeptical about it since palm oil is also in peanut butter lol.
3052 2018-01-26 17:17:11 It was interesting, but also a lil tedious lol. One of the readings was all about the death of the old business model for oil companies & spoke about shareholder value, CAPM and all that malarkey  I was so lost 
3053 2018-01-26 17:17:06 I'm not confounding communism with socialism. Also, all ideologies do not rely on oil and gas.
3054 2018-01-26 17:16:53 I been watching YouTube videos on hot oil treatments all morning.
3055 2018-01-26 17:16:33 Ask yourself when viewing fake news, why would Russia, with the majority of their revenue coming from oil, support a candidate who literally campaigned on “drill baby drill” ?
3056 2018-01-26 17:16:23 Truth is like being thrown head first into a boiling pot of water with liberals. They flail, scream and kick. Harsh analogy, yet the best to sum up. I was raised in a dem/lib household. If they think poison snake oil is the best thing ever, they will argue to death about it.
3057 2018-01-26 17:16:07 time and again / an avaricious oil baron / a murky past / proactive approach to life / cleavages /
3058 2018-01-26 17:16:06 I sure do love to see private cattle grazing, clear cut forestry, open pit mining and oil derricks on public lands.  It is such a reminder of the benefits to the rich and the enjoyment from the money they get  from using public lands. Trumps heritage.
3059 2018-01-26 17:16:00 You know you're thinking about a french fryer hot oil basket full of....
3060 2018-01-26 17:15:30 And high doses of palm oil, don’t forget!
3061 2018-01-26 17:15:29 Belize is another example. Planters have all but threatened them to get their cashew production but Belizeans have held their ground. We travel there a good bit and what America did to their oil supply is criminal. Side note: It's a beautiful country. Nothing shithole about it.
3062 2018-01-26 17:15:20 Big Oil?
3063 2018-01-26 17:15:17 ... and Nutella contains lots of yummy palm oil. Nobody needs rain forests or orang-utans! 
3064 2018-01-26 17:15:10 They lost their master grower around the time these were growing, maybe that has something to do with it. I wonder who’s buying $12 grams that tested at 13% six months ago? They should just pull it and make oil at this point. #ACMPR
3065 2018-01-26 17:15:02 10 weeks of product build (build that require more than a barrel to make per barrel). That's weak-to-mediocre demand. Troll away tsxnan.

3077 2018-01-26 17:13:35 I don’t know why but Japanese media are completely ignoring this news. I only hear updates from foreign news sources. Most of Japanese doen’t know that a oil tanker sank at Japan’s EEZ. Really weird...

3090 2018-01-26 17:11:57 Butter. Smells divine. You could use coconut oil. Olive oil looses it nutritional value once heated high.
3091 2018-01-26 17:11:56 @chigrl  .. is it possible to calculate the "fair value" price of oil based on supply & demand at any time? Or it is just too dynamic?

3102 2018-01-26 17:10:14 This ground is fairly old tbh. When the Uk gov come up with a replacement for the oil/gas that isn't Putin it might eventually come across as the threat it's intended to be. Otherwise it remains very much the fodder of low-info entrants into the indy debate.

3119 2018-01-26 17:08:27 how are you gonna have a $30,000+ truck and you can’t even change your own oil
3120 2018-01-26 17:08:18 Hahahahahaha!!! You are hilarious. Beyond bearish? What are you looking at? Record demand? 10 weeks of winter inventory draws? Cushing below the 5 year average? Global inventories quickly heading that direction?
3121 2018-01-26 17:08:01 Yep...oil money gives you that status.

3125 2018-01-26 17:07:36 I do. Happened once in history, in the playoffs. You want your coach to act up like that every time he doesn't get a call? I don't think it would be very fruitful
3126 2018-01-26 17:07:25 My supervisor thinks i am a think tank on Oil &Gas, been Asking me to write  legal opinions on it... Is this a trap?

3135 2018-01-26 17:07:09 Effects of the Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon (and other) spills are still to be found (and oil from both has *still* not weathered away). What an incredibly stupid idea, to open our coasts, not to mention our skies and our climate, to the consequences of drilling.

3149 2018-01-26 17:05:43 So totally unrelated would you be more excited if indy stayed at Carrol or moved to Lucas Oil?
3150 2018-01-26 17:05:28 Yet once again the Falklands have been part of the UK before Argentina was even a country. Funny how oil makes you want something you're not going to get.
3151 2018-01-26 17:05:24 Oil on the beach is more effective.  Look up the Santa Barbara oil spill in California.

3159 2018-01-26 17:04:34 Please revise, palm oil not good for kids/ adults, not good for the planet!
3160 2018-01-26 17:04:07 Palm oil is the best emulsifier in food industry. EU ban them but still most of their confectionery products required the use of palm oil.

3190 2018-01-26 17:01:31 Precisely why I posted it! All people look at is production volume. The larger question is, What are you going to do with 1 mmb/d more oil that cannot be readily refined & that makes poor quality gasoline & cannot be made into diesel?

3200 2018-01-26 17:01:00 Motor oil is the lifeblood of your engine. It picks up dirt, and other impurities and deposits them in the oil filter to keep your engine clean. Routine oil changes keep all the moving parts moving and cut down on friction to cool the motor so your vehicle keeps running.
3201 2018-01-26 17:00:56 This is a seasonal norm.  Priced in to the crude commodity.  What is anomalous at this point is higher seasonal demand, forcing higher crude runs, leading to un-seasonable stock draws.  A return to norm would be neutral, anything showing continued abnormal demand is bullish.

3245 2018-01-26 16:56:32 @realDonaldTrump The US are so "cutting edge" that they got out of the Paris accord and will increase its reliance on dirty fossil energy sources like coal and oil sands to levels never reached before. It doesn't make much sense.

3247 2018-01-26 16:56:27 Great Foresight & Focus! Will help avoid mistakes / recklessness of the past. Growing non-oil will sector cushions effects sudden of low oil price, boost our revenue, foreign reserve base and create jobs for our youth. This is surely good governance. Thanks @HMKemiAdeosun

3256 2018-01-26 16:55:01 The large growth of exports and imports was because of the following factors: shipping firms, demand for whale oil to light homes, improvements in ship design, steamships, and the govt. expanding U.S. trade to enter Japanese ports to take on coal. #foreigncommerceatitsfinest
3257 2018-01-26 16:54:48 we have talked about a lot of random shit in the past you know! Kosai. Mangoes. Monkeys, a certain Monkey, Architecture, Oil
3258 2018-01-26 16:54:46 This is what happens when you squander North Sea oil revenue and buy energy from abroad

3262 2018-01-26 16:54:35 Not im the budget list for oil painting although its kinda cool type of art..
3263 2018-01-26 16:54:25 water + tea tree oil spray 
3264 2018-01-26 16:54:05 Im not sure that even qualifies as salad. Thats like a piece of lettuce, a pickle slice, and a slab of uncooked pork thrown in olive oil sitting on a cold stove.
3265 2018-01-26 16:54:00 I would add that some of the jurisdictions most dependent on oil and gas have quasi-fascist rule.
3266 2018-01-26 16:53:59 Remember Roger Neilson and the white towel on the stick?
3267 2018-01-26 16:53:54 The oil price is more than double 2 years ago.
3268 2018-01-26 16:53:51 Buddy when will oil rally end ???

3270 2018-01-26 16:53:49 Like drilling the sea bed for oil.

3273 2018-01-26 16:53:39 Interested in protecting your citizens from harmful pollution? Maybe don't let the EPA rollback policy that limits these damaging substances from our environment. I can already sense the reply to this: "But what about those poor over-regulated coal and oil manufacturers?"

3275 2018-01-26 16:53:37 Who is the Secretary of State today? That Secretary of State should be in D.C. helping with the Mueller Investigation. We need the Gold Standard and peace in the Middle East. We are done with wars overseas and wars for oil. I deserve a non-combat position. GOD
3276 2018-01-26 16:53:35 Productive morning! I shitposted a TON. I pressed some friends' buttons. I got a haircut and my oil changed. I Pokemaned. Now for a little nap, and then that 2 PM meeting. Still feeling good. 
3277 2018-01-26 16:53:31 ロジカリーコップめちゃくちゃ気持ち良いです！
3278 2018-01-26 16:53:16 Took my baby (my car) in to the shop to have my heat/air conditioner looked at because the vents aren’t working, might as well get my oil changed while I’m here... 
3279 2018-01-26 16:53:16 I'm actually in favor if offshore drilling in New Jersey. The beach communities voted for Trump. Oil on the beach must be what they want.
3280 2018-01-26 16:53:09 Interesting to compare the resources USA vs India consume per head of population, like Energy, oil, plastic, food, cloth. Or even how much % World resources USA consumes vs % world Population. Or Obesity.

Also cost India's Mars mission with a similar USA mission 
3281 2018-01-26 16:53:07 Olive oil , Tee tree oil , peppermint oil, almond oil, Jojoba Oil , and Castor oil all in one bottle is the key to hair growth.
3282 2018-01-26 16:53:04 I’m a native Californian too and we all have to stand up to the Trump administration on this issue. No one wants to see oil rigs as the silhouette  as you watch a sunset in Northern California

3285 2018-01-26 16:52:28 True; and the mood is very anti onshore oil and gas at the moment (although Wytch Farm and Kimmeridge have been operating for years, I believe)
3286 2018-01-26 16:52:23 The loons are still loose though. Oil is beyond bearish.
3287 2018-01-26 16:52:20 So you like the idea of making state programs more reliant on oil prices, guaranteeing more revenue volatility?

3298 2018-01-26 16:50:10 Medway police officers arrived at their home to tell them about Fournier being badly injured in an accident after wrecking an oil truck.
3299 2018-01-26 16:50:00 My brother and his partner go there....they really like the place and it's very fairly priced. Their oil changes are a bit more expensive but their open about it...it keeps cost down on other work and allows them to pay their employees a fair wage. And their local!
3300 2018-01-26 16:49:56 You mean something that tastes like cake frosting is mostly sugar and oil!?!?!?!?!
3301 2018-01-26 16:49:33 GOP Congress failed to renew a longstanding oil tax to fund oil spills. When then Speaker Boehner was asked who would pay for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, he answered, " Taxpayers–Should Help Pay For Oil Spill." Private profit. Public debt.
3302 2018-01-26 16:49:04 Exactly and these days most cars take synthetic oil, the time it takes me to put my seatbelt on, put my stuff down and chose what i wanna listen to is enough time, it’s a waste of time to sit there n wait for the car to warm up.

3308 2018-01-26 16:48:17 Ha ha ha...without oil money many of you wouldn't even be existing as Chelsea fans. 
3309 2018-01-26 16:48:09 You are an expert on “Liveshot”, I’ll give you that. Did you see that the red-headed Kennedy is giving the rebuttal to Trump’s state of the union speech? Is he the runt of oil man’s litter?

3323 2018-01-26 16:46:40 So you didnt read the 2014 proposal, only the Heil?  Independence was not predicated on oil.  Do yourself a favour and look for facts, because you fell for every bit of crap.

3328 2018-01-26 16:46:03 I forgot to say that we also got the oil changed very recently so I don’t think it’s anything actually wrong with the oil, just mechanical issues. I’ll look into the electricity thing
3329 2018-01-26 16:46:00 I know! What a pain when language acquires a connotation that is different from its original ontextual meaning or the intent of those using it. Snake oil salesmen everywhere!
3330 2018-01-26 16:45:58 Absolutely despicable. Wolff is a modern dale snake oil salesman, trying to eek out sales of his book. Disgusting. Where are the outraged feminists?
3331 2018-01-26 16:45:56 Well, Warhammer World was everything I hoped it would be. The Exhibition Centre was stunning. So inspiring. Also, picked up some of the exclusive swag: Space Marine Command Tanks and Slaves to Darkness book. And a pot of Nuln oil. obvs  #warmongers
3332 2018-01-26 16:45:38 Yes smartarse, we know what olive oil is for! Fuck off with the explanations!  #TippingPoint
3333 2018-01-26 16:45:33 I'm surprised that that is stalled.  I thought it would continue to grow if slowly, now oil prices have recovered.
3334 2018-01-26 16:45:28 i didn’t put anything in my hair besides aragon oil & i put that in last night.. pray for my curls.
3335 2018-01-26 16:45:19 It’s really odd - because in the UK oil doesn’t have to be changed even close to that often. No oil changes in an EV :-)
3336 2018-01-26 16:45:18 Make a new smoothie and buy a new perfume oil. Better still, buy 2 oils and give one to the younger Temi
3337 2018-01-26 16:45:16 So. Woke up late, and getting my oil changed. For the first time on my own, I am hungry lol

3341 2018-01-27 23:58:56 I do something with a similar flavour profile: orange zest, ginger, salt, pepper, brown sugar, olive oil and toss sweet potatoes in that.  Bake on 350 for maybe 20-30 mins- TIL done.

3345 2018-01-27 23:58:03 This was a fascinating read. Peterson’s snake oil is his positioning of “postmodernism” as some amorphous grand narrative into which he folds everything conservatives and reactionaries hate, then presents it as a terrifying dissolution of reality itself. It’s built on fear.
3346 2018-01-27 23:58:02 Cast iron is great for deep frying. It retains the heat when you put the food in, so the oil never cools off and soaks in the food.

3377 2018-01-27 23:54:39 When I went through a parking lot in north Davis on Thursday, I saw the rainwater moved quickly through the asphalt ground into the drain, and it was mixed with some oil. The runoff would be much slower if it was going through the soil.

3380 2018-01-27 23:54:22 That happened to me once, I was getting an oil change and my mom texted me saying it was going to be $500 because they had to replace the breaks
3381 2018-01-27 23:54:13 @dominos My pizza was bad. Lack of sauce. Also ordered bread twists and they were small and full of oil.

3383 2018-01-27 23:54:05 my daddy got my oil changed, filled my tank up, took me out to eat AND bought me a bottle...my day can’t get any better! 
3384 2018-01-27 23:53:59 Yes Scotland's oil and it's also payed in American dollers
3385 2018-01-27 23:53:54 there is a “coconut oil and lemon juice turns grey hair back to normal color” thing flying around facebook and i’m reminded of microwaving our smartphones to recharge the batteries and how smart that was.
3386 2018-01-27 23:53:52 I have a oil life meter and I check it every once in a while manually too, but good lord I have never... let it get that bad

3388 2018-01-27 23:53:37 In that caseee start taking Evening Primrose Oil and your cervix will begin to soften and it’ll help prevent tearing. The worst pain is the contractions as they get closer, if you get an epidural it’ll honestly be a breeze. You won’t even remember the pain when RJ is here

3390 2018-01-27 23:53:20 @foe_us We should send a message to our corporate oligarchy that we

Boycott gas, oil and other fossil fuel products for Valentine's day.  
It is measurable, but doesn't expose participants to reprisal.
3391 2018-01-27 23:53:19 i forgot about the tempura that went with the soba but

thats a lot of oil for just 2 shrimp bc im the only one home so there's no point in making more... also we haven't cleaned the deep fryer in months and its not mine so i dont want to be the one to potentially break it.....
3392 2018-01-27 23:53:02 Man, I hate religiosity so much. Maybe this is Mars squaring my Saturn in the 9th. I'm done with pat answers, useless jargon, and all the snake oil being sold. Tired, tired, tired.

3394 2018-01-27 23:52:24 ...We will not repeat the mistakes of the past, when as a country we failed to fully utilize rising oil prices to develop our infrastructure
3395 2018-01-27 23:51:46 *Drunk dude comes in calling cashiers snowflakes because his oil change is taking so long yet he doesn't realize they're not the ones working on his car and somehow doesnt see anything wrong with him putting other motorists lives at risk repeatedly calls cashier homo*
3396 2018-01-27 23:51:33 Billons of dollars for a wall but we don't have money for infrastructure? Sounds about right. Typical political nonsense? The great oil salesman said Mexico is going to pay for it. Some deal maker.
3397 2018-01-27 23:51:22 "Clean yourself.  I shouldn't have to tell you how much it would cost to clean grease and oil out..."

3402 2018-01-27 23:50:31 Please share 

Update: I have limited use of a vehicle that has a broken heater...due to a coolant leak. Part of negotiation for continued use is requirement that I get two new front tires, new windshield, have heat/coolant issue repaired, and an oil change. +
3403 2018-01-27 23:50:28 I want to assure Nigerians that every additional income that comes to the Federal Government in 2018, from the rising price of crude oil...
3404 2018-01-27 23:50:25 You are holding the Dreamers hostage for a wall 67% of Americans don’t want to fund. Let me remind you what you said “MEXICO WILL PAY FOR THE WALL!” Who’s going to pay? “MEXICO!” Snake Oil! Figures.
3405 2018-01-27 23:50:12 Unlicensed driver did this @NYDailyNews. You say arrested for unlicensed driving in past too. Headline should not be "oil truck plows ..."
3406 2018-01-27 23:50:07 @Moonalice We should send a message to the corporate oligarchy that we can act.  Let's give mother earth a Valentine's day present.
Boycott gas, oil and other fossil fuel products for Valentine's day.  
It is measurable, but doesn't expose participants to reprisal.
3407 2018-01-27 23:50:05 I really need to invest in an essential oil diffuser

3410 2018-01-27 23:49:35 Don’t put no damn coconut oil on ur face please
3411 2018-01-27 23:49:21 It’s risotto rice, two veg stock cubes, turmeric, cayenne pepper, garam masala, quorn chicken, onion, garlic, pepper and peas. You fry the rice onion garlic and pepper in the spices and oil for 5 then add the rest and water gradually xx
3412 2018-01-27 23:49:13 really nice. I have worked with oil well core since 2008. I really likes your job!
3413 2018-01-27 23:49:09 Definitely not. My mate makes the best ever using just whatever randon vessel full of liquid magma.

...it may just be oil but you get the drift. No need to buy something from an infomercial.
3414 2018-01-27 23:49:04 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
3415 2018-01-27 23:48:52 When will twitter skin care gurus learn that coconut oil is awful for your skin. Please don’t ever
3416 2018-01-27 23:48:42 Don't DIY your cleansing oil, but lmao at "put olive oil in a salad" then tweeting an olive oil cleanser.
3417 2018-01-27 23:48:06 Only a city fan would compare a local businessman saving a club from going bust to  an autocratic regime ploughing over a billion in oil money for PR reasons in another continent. Just another financially  doped , sugar daddy club. City are nothing more.
3418 2018-01-27 23:47:33 So pissed. Filled the oil tank 1st. of December, it was empty, $503.00, Filled oil tank this evening,$687.36., $89.66 of the total is taxes. Then increase from Dec1 to now is the passing on of tariffs that Trump imposed on the oil we ship to the U.S. for processing and buy back!
3419 2018-01-27 23:47:27 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.
3420 2018-01-27 23:47:27 Slightly less war! Slightly less exploitation of workers! Slightly less money in politics! Slightly less income inequality! Slightly less corporate globalization! Slightly less big insurance, pharma, oil, etc. Just isn't a rallying cry to me. I want it all. Smash capitalism.
3421 2018-01-27 23:47:15 I love heading out into the world at night after it's rained.  It's like I get to go explore an oil painting.
3422 2018-01-27 23:47:13 That’s definitely not the oil down iz be craving right tru 
3423 2018-01-27 23:46:52 State Level - Showing the most dramatic changes -  The Death Cards have been dealt ... The Scope Of Corporate Ownership - Oil refiners Building Daily!  Chicken farm go from 1M to 2.5M! Janesville WI experiencing a *Boom*?! Everywhere- Every Level !  Trump Must Be Removed!

3425 2018-01-27 23:46:32 I always see the same guy in gallery selling body oil
3426 2018-01-27 23:45:59 when consuming Vegemite with anything that has Mediterranean lineage omit butter and add olive oil.... soz
3427 2018-01-27 23:45:38 Trump thus far seems to be a chior boy compared to the man whom made oil deals with the destabiliazation of Lybia.
3428 2018-01-27 23:45:35 Most of them made in China and made of plastic. #Plastic production accounts for 8% of the world's oil reserves. Every piece of plastic that was ever produced still exists. #plasticpollution
3429 2018-01-27 23:45:19 I’ve literally had my hot oil treatment in my hair for 3 hrs lmao  I got lazy 
3430 2018-01-27 23:45:02 I guess they thought I was going to pitch them snake oil or something.
たぶん彼らは、私がいんちき薬か何かを売り込もうとしていると思ったのでしょう。
3431 2018-01-27 23:44:27 Oil down is trash
3432 2018-01-27 23:44:15 The sulfur powder can be found anywhere online , but I usually purchase mine from Etsy . If you mix it with a light oil like grapeseed , tea tree oil , olive oil - or you can use all of them - you'll have a really nice mix .
3433 2018-01-27 23:44:02 Forgot to oil my hair.
3434 2018-01-27 23:43:52 I was talking to @oilfractals. He did allude to the fact that the oil is at sea long ago. But still, good data.
3435 2018-01-27 23:43:46 Oh I have the oil changes for life at the place I bought my car from. They're just slow
3436 2018-01-27 23:43:37 I know you didn’t ask me but that’s what I do (Jackie approved). I moisturize, prime and then take a fluffy brush or sponge and put it all over my face. Then just take my foundation (liquid) and blend it in. Controls my oil and it looks flawless.
3437 2018-01-27 23:43:33 Everybody could keep dey oil down, including us. Dat and mauby you will never find in my vicinity.
3438 2018-01-27 23:43:22 7 billion Burning oil and coal 24/7/365 is de facto Geo engineering

3446 2018-01-27 23:42:07 coconut oil in my eyes
3447 2018-01-27 23:42:06 ...wonder if it's the same dude who did an 'oil change' on my car that turned out to be 'drain oil, call it a day'.
3448 2018-01-27 23:41:59 The first ingredient in the deep cleansing oil is olive oil.
3449 2018-01-27 23:41:46 She was not frightened at all. A drop of oil
from the lamp she held fell on the sleeping god and he woke instantly. Eros saw his Psyche
leaning over him with a dagger in her hand and with great sorrow he spread his wings and
flew away.
3450 2018-01-27 23:41:31 Palm oil s supposed to be bad or something but who cares it’s delicious.
3451 2018-01-27 23:41:15 Coconut oil is just way too greasy to moisturize your balls.
3452 2018-01-27 23:41:08 I really like marinated artichoke hearts in my salad, but I could probably just drink a gallon of olive oil instead.
3453 2018-01-27 23:41:00 It is January, It is time to clean, sharpen and oil some of your tools before spring comes or get some new ones. Let's Grow #foodgrowing #januarygardentasks #joyofgrowing

3460 2018-01-27 23:40:05 You see when it comes right down to it you are relying on hearsay and conspiracy theories from ranting Hannity... no facts. You cannot even findvonebin the last month. He keeps saying wait and you’ll see. Just kind a snaje oil salesman .
3461 2018-01-27 23:39:39 TIL - rotate tires every oil change
3462 2018-01-27 23:39:27 ya i just hate that gross squeaky tight feeling i think lol, feels rly unnatural. the prickly pear oil on my face + jojoba for my cuticles and hair seems to keep the oiliness balanced atm so
3463 2018-01-27 23:39:19 Fox and Friends, the network is a non-stop peddler of GOP swill and Trump’s snake oil. The best Trumpfluffers on the air.

3466 2018-01-27 23:38:58 Roasted Brussels sprouts are the best- halved, chunky chopped onions, olive oil, balsamic, s&p

3468 2018-01-27 23:38:46 "Uh, alright."  *Putting the tool in hand away before moving the toolbox out of the way, Tails then closed the hood.  There's more dirt and oil on his face and hands.*
3469 2018-01-27 23:38:43 Ten huvks for one mask? I think not. Gimme some oatmeal, honey and lavender oil and we're  all good.
3470 2018-01-27 23:38:42 The oil itself is an alternative to your inhalers.
You should be having your inhalers with you everywhere.
3471 2018-01-27 23:38:41 It seems high, but Benzes get $100 oil changes every 10k miles or once a year.
3472 2018-01-27 23:38:36 May I suggest fried fish-head on onion roll, okra cooked in cod liver oil, hash, and wash it down with buter milk!!!! #Fineeats
3473 2018-01-27 23:38:32 I got ready today like if I was going on a date. Shaved everything, put oil on my body, did a face and lip mask, and did my hair and makeup. Who am I? 
3474 2018-01-27 23:37:41 Typical liberal. Do as I say but not what I do! Big Bird DiBlasio can use all the oil & gas he wants because duh he’s the Mayor
3475 2018-01-27 23:36:41 Jay overtook traffic to try and get back to the club as fast as possible, all red lights were disregarded and luckily the car was fast enough to cut through the streets.

3476 2018-01-27 23:36:31 OILさん、ありがとうございます(*´∇｀*)
3477 2018-01-27 23:36:21 @gallogallo1967 Can you get your hands on Oregano oil, Olive leaf extract, Seed-a-cept? A few drops of any one in a broth will help w/flu.  104 is not good. Stress from twitter stuff also not good
3478 2018-01-27 23:36:15 I am looking for a chest and drawers! Anyone? Oil & Gas?
3479 2018-01-27 23:36:11 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
3480 2018-01-27 23:35:55 The guys that are doing my oil change keep giving me shit about how beat up my car is but my car has been more faithful to me than anyone and they can suck my dick

3486 2018-01-27 23:34:31 I totally agree with you. It's counter-intuitive. My hubby works in oil. Our health care is largely funded by oil revenue. But I get told I don't count, by the same community I help. It's where Alberta is at, divided by this line drawn by our politicians that we all buy into.
3487 2018-01-27 23:34:24 Hoy me voy a fuel oil con mis amigos ya fue
3488 2018-01-27 23:34:20 New kid on the block in the oil industry ...
3489 2018-01-27 23:34:08 Cannabis is a threat to the tobacco, alcohol, pharmaceutical, oil, textile, plastic, timber and prison industries.  For starters.  It literally is a miracle plant that has been with humanity since the beginning of humanity.  It’s illegality is a crime against nature.
3490 2018-01-27 23:33:46 $80 for an oil change is pretty standard nowadays, unless you have an older car and also do it yourself.
3491 2018-01-27 23:33:40 I smoked my oil pen in my moms car when she was driving and she told me “stop smoking your liquid weed in here”

3495 2018-01-27 23:33:02 I don't think I have ever seen diesel cheaper than regular. I just figured that was normal. More oil and natural gas flows through the Port of Houston than anywhere else. We Texans just have a shorter route to get it. Cali has higher taxes and transportation costs to get theirs.
3496 2018-01-27 23:32:57 It's built up London very nicely though. All that oil and we have children having to be fed from food banks!
3497 2018-01-27 23:32:30 Oil companies for the coup in Iran that led to the 1979 revolution, the United Fruit Company for the coup in Guatemala, copper companies for the coup in Chile that led to Pinochet... the list goes on.
3498 2018-01-27 23:32:27 I had oil down once before. It was real good
3499 2018-01-27 23:32:22 Oh no there’s oil even though that doesn’t make it taste bad and it still tastes and feels amazing
3500 2018-01-27 23:31:21 Now that’s a fun oil diffuser! Hey @matthewgorton This .stl is for you!!!
3501 2018-01-27 23:31:19 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
3502 2018-01-27 23:31:16 Now I crave oil down
3503 2018-01-27 23:31:08 @LBC the thing is with the capltalist system it heavily depends on stuff that's in the ground, especially oil, so what happens when there's no oil to make the stuff and no petrol 2 power our machines to the places where we go 2 make the stuff and the places after to buy the stuff
3504 2018-01-27 23:30:49 Military in oil fields, IRS rules didn't say US just the military, ours don't watch the oil fields. The Syrian envoy was referring to this supporting Isis and the 2009 vacuum Trump was referring too. Gm Dodge sell out. They weren't bankrupt, same amount of everything vehicle sold
3505 2018-01-27 23:30:45 I really want to work with oil paints but that means i gave to go buY MORE ART SUPPLIES THAT I DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR 
3506 2018-01-27 23:30:37 Venezuela and Ecuador have significantly increased oil output

3511 2018-01-27 23:30:04 The this is the oil is not real it's been manipulated. It because they know Nigerians like to buy anything foreign.
3512 2018-01-27 23:29:56 CapeTown’s h2O crisis is perfect eg. of how humans behave when a resource becomes scarce to almost extinct; consumption actually increases every man for himself regardless of inevitable demise.Fresh water, bison, cod, salmon, whales;list is endless.
Oil companies behave same way.
3513 2018-01-27 23:29:53 やっぱり7時には起きられなかったよ
3514 2018-01-27 23:29:17 It's beyond pitiful. The combination of lazy minded buffoonery wedded to snake oil salesmanship!
3515 2018-01-27 23:29:07 I can 100% respect that! I just can’t handle that much oil - I feel like it makes the fries too soggy unless you eat them all right away. But then I have no room for my burger! Tragic.
3516 2018-01-27 23:28:58 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius
3517 2018-01-27 23:28:44 You don’t really think @realDonaldTrump cares? He who proclaims it’s all about jobs could care less. It is more important to him to keep oil and coal in business rather than aiding in providing ways to heal our environment.

3523 2018-01-27 23:28:13 NO commerce can Survive without Ibo's yet not functional Port in the SE.
90% Oil comes from SS but the biggest and only functional Refinery is coming up in Lagos. 

Nigeria is not fair to Nigerians
3524 2018-01-27 23:28:12 Any brand names for the oil

3530 2018-01-27 23:27:13 Australia had an unemployment rate under 2% between WW2 and 1970
Govt were afraid to let it go higher

After the first world oil crises govts worldwide were conned to raise the minimum U/E rate.
This helped big business control wages growth.

3535 2018-01-27 23:26:29 Today while I was at work my dad came and got my car and changed the oil, then Jake vacuumed and washed my car #blessed 
3536 2018-01-27 23:26:13 There was more oil than stew.
3537 2018-01-27 23:26:07 I had a VW that did that, only with oil

3542 2018-01-27 23:24:52 #LFC's transfer record prior to selling Coutinho ONLY 2 weeks ago would have us 3rd in your list, with only the richest club in the world and a club with oil money above us.

3547 2018-01-27 23:23:32 Went bankrupt when the oil prices fell and that's probably what happened to pirate oilfield and Carter county resources too just too much debt for the owner to pay off and it closed but he bought it Google never update it's info for business I know that for a fact
3548 2018-01-27 23:23:04 I need an oil change 
3549 2018-01-27 23:22:58 Honestly think that was their time to win it, I can’t see them getting close to it again in the next 20 years unless they’re bought by a country or oil giant.
3550 2018-01-27 23:22:58 I agree totally with what he said.  So will others when they pick themselves up off the floor from laughing so much.  Doesn't say much for the intellect of Israel and the US who support the Saudis. It obviously has to do with oil/gas and money.
3551 2018-01-27 23:22:56 took my first dose of cbd oil and almost threw up because of the taste. it was even mint chocolate flavor! Im gonna start putting it in smoothies and maybe my coffee and hope it tastes better.

Them: no idea 
Me: should prolly change it going by the color alone
Them: nah it's not leaking yet
Me: what?
Them: yeah, when it starts leaking from the front & rear main seal, I know it's time for a change and a fresh bottle of stop leak.
Me: leave.

3578 2018-01-27 23:18:13 That's bad news to think of ANY variant on that, then. Here are just some insane ideas I thought of, and I don't like them:
- Oil made out of Lucas? WTH?
- A multinational fossil fuel corporation headed by a boy from Earthbound?
- Maybe a lube service owned by Lucas would be cool

It's frustrating to work hard for your province and still be told you're a drain. 46 yrs here, it's always been about oil. It does unfortunately breed resentment.

3650 2018-01-27 23:05:02 Expansion of human civilization may well impact biodiversity but article does not show that slight climate impact of last 50 years has done so. Misguided green climate policy e.g. palm oil as biofuel has had adverse impact through habitat destruction.

3658 2018-01-27 23:04:11 If Justin would get some pipelines built in Canada and encourage the Oil companies to build more refineries then the economy would boom once again. But, he’s not gonna do that when we can get our oil from the Middle East. Fucking bullshit.

When u interfere in the natural functioning of a market . you disrupt its equilibrium and establish a parallel market.  We were not the only oil dependent nation. But only few got deep into recession.

3696 2018-01-27 22:58:49 if manufacturers could stop putting coconut/coconut oil in things it wasn't in before that'd be great.  i just want to eat cookies in peace and without my throat closing up.

(i'm looking at YOU trader joe's.)
3697 2018-01-27 22:58:36 Me trying to get an oil change:
Dude: It'll be about an hour for us to get your car through. 
Me: Seriously? There isn't even a line. 
Dude: Yeah, we're just understaffed. The boss got off at 2:00, our assistant manager's in jail, so we're running low.

That man is amazing.
3698 2018-01-27 22:58:27 He’s a shit-thick, Sheffield accented, dead eyed, hollowed out tale told by a madman. He makes Titus Oates seem classy. His wares make snake oil seem sound. He’s alone. So very alone.

3708 2018-01-27 22:56:20 i have crazy oily skin too (is that a pcos thing idk) but i find that using soapy shit on my face dries it out and then it like... overproduces more oil to compensate?? somehow the oil makes my skin less oily in the long run lmfao but i get it tho it can seem/feel gross at first
3709 2018-01-27 22:56:06 Kangana?

3715 2018-01-27 22:55:33 Now that is good news. OPEC has been manipulating the market and has had an adverse effect on the economy in areas of the country where oil companies and related service companies operate.
3716 2018-01-27 22:55:28 And taking money from NRA, Russia, Big Oil  & jailing disabled protestors, supporting anything that beefs up his bank account & ambition.

3724 2018-01-27 22:53:49 General Jack Keene said we should block the back channel of sea where oil is still getting thru to NK. I agree.
3725 2018-01-27 22:53:44 After inhaling oil exhaust fumes from driving my car all afternoon, it's safe to say I need to visit the mechanic. 
3726 2018-01-27 22:53:44 What’s your near term road map (and potential top in oil prices) and where do you see it falling to after? Thanks.
3727 2018-01-27 22:53:30 Need to get yourself some argan oil. That stuff is a miracle.

3729 2018-01-27 22:53:22 Season cauliflower, squash, or potatoes with taco seasoning and put it in a frying pan with oil and lemon juice. Sear for a few minutes and then put it in the oven to cook it through. Makes for great burrito/taco filling.
3730 2018-01-27 22:53:18 フォッカチオっていうかふつうにパン
3731 2018-01-27 22:53:12 Yes! Exactly that kinda thing. Pure oil.  It can vary vastly in price. But I know Wilko price was pretty cheap. Half a dozen drops in hot bath  
It is very relaxing  which may help 
3732 2018-01-27 22:53:06 Oh and while I'm on the subject, what EXACTLY are your credentials for being a so-called expert Black? According to @canyonwlkr you have none and are NOT a licensed Psychotherapist or Psychiatrist, so yeah you're just a modern day snake oil peddler.
3733 2018-01-27 22:53:05 Hannity is a truly ignorant baffoon who didn't finish school, lies and is a snake oil salesman in training. Those who listen to Hannity or any of the other disgraceful examples of really FAKE NEWS on Fox News are willing participants in their charade as a News Organization.

3742 2018-01-27 22:51:46 Yes, I’m part of the good crusty bread & olive oil society. We sneak around retail facilities all around the world, conspiring to eat well
3743 2018-01-27 22:51:45 I have (with avocado oil) but I find that it works best if I just do the tiniest blot on each little fucker

3750 2018-01-27 22:50:48 coconut AND olive oil??? that’s practically suicide
3751 2018-01-27 22:50:44 Which brings me full circle to say Trump was right to put the tariff on solar companies this week. He is saving us from the Chinese and we will dominate with oil and gas while everyone else is in the dark...so much makes sense to me now.

3753 2018-01-27 22:50:26 No one's talking about diminishing oil and gas, myself I'm directly employed in it so not sure where you're assuming that from. The sector is beginning to boom but you seem to not want to acknowledge that.
3754 2018-01-27 22:50:16 Yep. Ditto fish oil...
3755 2018-01-27 22:50:16 Ask your country men what they cook and call Oil down
3756 2018-01-27 22:50:15 NOTHING is sacred for this administration. They only answer to their money and oil gods. Earth can't sustain greed of this magnitude.
3757 2018-01-27 22:50:11 pretty sure like
peanut butter
has a decent amount of oil in it
3758 2018-01-27 22:50:11 Lol you see exon Mobil and it's always about the oil industry, yeah it includes gas.
3759 2018-01-27 22:49:59 Continuing to to work to build capacity in green energy should be applauded but we remain dependent on oil & gas and that is not going away anytime soon. In Canada, a strong oil & gas industry = a strong economy which allows for further investment.
3760 2018-01-27 22:49:43 i was at trader joe’s and a woman asked me where i got my coconut oil then asked me where i was from. when i said i was from ghana she gave me a really loving hug and we exchanged some words in twi. it was a really lovely experience :’)
3761 2018-01-27 22:49:28 And despite YPG's past hostilities against SAA, Damascus continues to allow them free entry to reinforce Afrin. I think this is generous, they never gave us anything. And we're all still sour from the Omari oil field drama.
3762 2018-01-27 22:49:12 I toned off camera with a hydrating toner! The rest of my routine was pretty much off camera cause i couldn’t hold my phone and apply the products lol! I’m applying rosehip oil tonight and the Cerave Healing Ointment on top. I also have eczema!

Cajiib!
3770 2018-01-27 22:48:10 Well then realistically we should be comparing employment numbers now compared to when oil was last at 60+. Would this not be the fairest way to compare there will still be some variance but closest thing we can do to compare  to .
3771 2018-01-27 22:48:06 The naturalistas stay swearing that olive oil is responsible for softening  those tresses to 3a..
3772 2018-01-27 22:48:01 I doh appreciate all this talk of oil down knowing that I'm hundreds of miles away from the closest pot. Allyuh really wicked on this app. Muh bellly go be touching muh back come February 7th, but by all means continue eh 
3773 2018-01-27 22:47:39 Dude my hair will not produce it’s on oil/moisture for shit..

3777 2018-01-27 22:47:28 Yes. It does and also something called jojoba oil. Ima buy some of that and mix it w the tea tree oil and see how that works.
3778 2018-01-27 22:47:15 Agree many workers can’t find work .. this consequence economic scarcity as population growth labor force exceeds resources limitations partly hidden by accelerated extraction short run like oil example

3779 2018-01-27 22:47:13 If every one of you Grenadians on twitter can’t give me a plate of Oil Down come Feb 7th is me and all you!!
3780 2018-01-27 22:46:54 "Literally" tons of jobs. I can weigh them. I can't wait. By the way, do you know where I can find fifty percent of the world's oil that is being used daily? Do you think that carbon taxes are going to stop shipping? Are you serious? Are you really, really serious?!!
3781 2018-01-27 22:46:41 I came to target only for detergent .. and I left with a mug, dry shampoo, and coconut oil

3788 2018-01-27 22:45:57 Easy peezy take the 4 billion we give Mexico a year and apply to wall and future upkeep. You realize that the reason that Mexico fights so much is the remittance payments to Mexico have outpaced their oil production. Tax those

3822 2018-01-27 22:41:17 5 drops of oregano oil under the tongue-hold for 1 minute then swallow with water--twice a day-helps to decrease duration of flu and colds
3823 2018-01-27 22:41:05 Priyanka and superwoman’s shampoo oil commercial is super cheesy, badly scripted & poorly acted. 2 Indian women really trynna tell me something Pantene put in a tube is better than oiling my hair once a week? They can’t look their Dadi in the face and tells those lies...
3824 2018-01-27 22:40:53 You have to correct for the underlying cost of oil, not just dollar value, and deduct all tax to start from the actual price of oil.

3826 2018-01-27 22:40:34 I get a lot of fans don't feel Larsson was fair value but without him and Russell what does the Oil d look like.  Would Hall's offense make up for the extra goals the oil would be giving up.
3827 2018-01-27 22:40:22 ウルフもハイエナも事情があるんだって

3830 2018-01-27 22:39:36 Coat the bottom of a skillet in oil. Sauté kumquat slices for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Let that cool for 20 minutes and then flush down the toilet and have pizza
3831 2018-01-27 22:39:36 Lmao the oil down pic girl
3832 2018-01-27 22:39:22 What do you people of the Internetz use in oil paints other than linseed oil? I've heard walnut oil is nice, any other ideas?
3833 2018-01-27 22:38:55 Yeah not too familiar with the coconut oil but I remember grabbing it from Walmart not even gonna hold you.
3834 2018-01-27 22:38:50 Don’t get me wrong, great chassis, and the engine has plenty of power, just don’t like the sound and the oil consumption problem
3835 2018-01-27 22:38:35 Back up your statement with some facts. Cuz, baby, we got facts galore on the snake oil salesman Trump. If you say Benghazi, birth cert, muslim,or anything uranium, I will send the hounds of hell to eat your face.
3836 2018-01-27 22:38:34 Love the rebuttal, never unfollow as you also need perspective on non-renewable resources. The work is changing & Canada should be on the forefront. Trump placed huge tariffs on Solar Panels coming into USA as oil is king for $ We are borrowing the earth from our grandkids.

3839 2018-01-27 22:38:30 insurance for cars and for health are supposed to be the same thing, financial help in cases of severe loss. Insurance doesn’t buy aspirin or cough syrup or oil changes. The more you want to include the more you pay. The more you include the less affordable it is.
3840 2018-01-27 22:38:22 Remember that #Oil embargo, low supply big lines? Then I'm like "What happened to all that Peak Oil talk?" Of course Big Oil or the defenders will say it's due to technology however they look and see years in advance. Control the supply, raise the price, keep selling.
3841 2018-01-27 22:38:11 “makeup remover = olive oil” i’m absolutely haunted put that in a salad please
3842 2018-01-27 22:38:02 If that's wuh alyuh calling oil down, alyuh could keep that
3843 2018-01-27 22:37:52 to anyone else having a bad day: buy/cook your fave meal, light a candle, take a bath, drench yourself in coconut oil and then put on a big tee & relax. things won’t be perfect but you’ll for sure feel better & glow at the same time
3844 2018-01-27 22:37:44 This tea tree oil stink but it works 
3845 2018-01-27 22:37:44 It's very shoking but the truth is - if you mention Nigeria to the average European the vision they have is: 419 + Oil money + Boko Haram + Corruption. This is the truth.
I fight everyday - full time - to change this perception.

3861 2018-01-27 22:34:58 My first car that I still drive is a Civic, and I honestly beat the hell out of it and haven't done any of the recommended maintenance besides oil changes, and (knock on wood), haven't had any issues yet. I'll run it until it blows! haha

3867 2018-01-27 22:33:45 Hey there  so I did 2 thin coats of Leadbeltcher, a bit of Nuln oil, stormhost sliver highlight then painted on the glazes  didn’t water down the glazes at all. I suggest apply a light coat of glaze then gradually apply it more heavily if you wanted to 
3868 2018-01-27 22:33:43 I’m in the waiting roomwhile getting my oil change, and I ate some jalapeño poppers and I gotta fart soooo bad and there’s people around

3874 2018-01-27 22:33:06 One of your top aids is married to big oil and gas, forcing permits, having the DEP direct complaints of citizens to Sunoco (told by the DEP this was their orders) also said there was a lot of political pressure. Sounds like a gift. #govwolfcollusion

3877 2018-01-27 22:32:23 I have a niece (family of 6) who runs electricity in her home (heat/air conditioners/TVs/game consoles/large appliances etc) practically 24/7 & her bill is 1/20 of mine w/only 2 ppl at home. She has solar panels! Wish I had some. W/oil & coal, they do control/suppress the masses.
3878 2018-01-27 22:32:20 Republican Party = Big oil money = abortion rights = voter suppression = racism = - EPA = pay inequality  Look we are not asking for a whole lot just a livable wage how about making big companies join the union there’s great pay & healthcare problem solved
3879 2018-01-27 22:32:20 As long as there's no oil or other natural resources to exploit in a place, coalition will not risk confrontation with a cornered Turkey over it.
Mark my words: Kurds are an easily expendable asset to the coalition.

What, are you putting a slab of Cathedral City into a metal tray of sunflower oil, rosemary and garlic, then placing into an oven pre-heated to 180 degrees for 30-40 minutes?

Christ.

3889 2018-01-27 22:30:47 lol I forgot about the Maine italian, which is not replicated anywhere else in the country. capicola, salami, pepperoni, provolone, oil and vinegar, maybe some tomatoes and lettuce. mine was the deli meat and some shitty lettuce
3890 2018-01-27 22:30:32 I've been cooking more with coconut oil instead of oil or butter.  Anyone got cooking tips for this?  So far I've kept it very basic.
3891 2018-01-27 22:30:14 how do mua/mue’s just let oil drip down their face when doing IG tutorials? so messy

3895 2018-01-27 22:29:21 There is only so much a manager can do. He is doing his bit by atleast attracting a better level of players to the club. However, do you genuinely expect anyone to compete with such a net spend?

Do you see Chelsea struggling now that the oil money is running out?
3896 2018-01-27 22:29:09 They could sell to a Mike Ashley… We were shopped around to the oil barons before FSG and none were interested
3897 2018-01-27 22:28:56 @CBCNews article Don that correctly points out that the oil & gas investment capital is moving south due to 1. US policy and 2. Federal NEB punitive regulatory practices. U might wanna wake up to the fact that Canada is a resource-based economy. Don’t like facts then unfollow me

3907 2018-01-27 22:27:26 Trump & big Oil will try to stop this, just like he just put a Tariff on imported solar panels.
3908 2018-01-27 22:27:10 We are in a supply deficit already. Shale  growth will disappoint consensus views to the downside. I don’t expect cheating to occur until we start talking about “peak oil” again.  Oil at $75 and the relization that shale isn’t the answer .. then cheat.
3909 2018-01-27 22:27:09 Yeah,  keep wishing another oil arabian owner to buy liverpool..
3910 2018-01-27 22:27:05 I put coconut oil on my hair and scalp overnight before bleaching and then bleach over it and it definitely helps to stop the burn!

3913 2018-01-27 22:26:27 Only salient point is how much palm oil is used in the US version. Compared to other hazelnut spreads using a higher quality/better tasting recipe.

3921 2018-01-27 22:25:13 I think Oil fans don't realize how low the offers were for Hall, what other name do we know Ceci? I can't see return on RNH and Eberle be any better if Hall was the best player.  The Oilers had to overpay to get return.  Look at what Mtl wanted for Subban

3927 2018-01-27 22:24:22 Come in really? Drilling off shore, in National Parks etc. We are better than Trump unless one aspires and admires Trump. Wide open, unregulated Wild West oil mentality instead of economic diversity got us into the predicament we are in. No job growth. #oildependant #cpcplan

3951 2018-01-27 22:21:25 I know that math may be tough for you but oil dropped years ago. The province is still doing well. Even in their so-called down times they have an unemployment rate most of the country would love to have.

3971 2018-01-27 22:18:10 #DYK: oil from foods that have been digested enter into the lungs via the bloodstream and causes bad breath.
3972 2018-01-27 22:18:09 @great_oil Hello We are a Andalusian couple living in Scotland interested to buy your oil :)
3973 2018-01-27 22:18:05 Checking if the oil is okay
3974 2018-01-27 22:18:02 Dites-moi que vous savez que castor oil veut dire huile de ricin et pas huile de castor.
3975 2018-01-27 22:17:51 Don't know much about Devilman, but now I want Ryo to drink a quart of motor oil.
3976 2018-01-27 22:17:42 Cotton gloves for handling and as little as possible. Store in a dry area, use moisture removers if you can. Irons, a dab of three-in-one oil every so often
3977 2018-01-27 22:17:37 The war mongers at the heads of weapons companies love her. She would have been fine.

They would try to take out  Bernie because he would end these needless wars over oil and weapons contracts.
3978 2018-01-27 22:17:31 Out of tanning oil, dough, and straw. Then God filled that shell with garbage from "the best" dump.
3979 2018-01-27 22:17:23 I had it once but I don’t think it was the authentic kind cause it had coconut oil in it lol u know where I could find the authentic ones at?
3980 2018-01-27 22:17:16 +1 for healthy & fit oil workers!
3981 2018-01-27 22:17:12 Check your oil
3982 2018-01-27 22:17:06 But Trump is interested only on use of oil (cronies invested make big bucks) & coal (pollutant). He & many corporations have been trying to prevent the use of clean energy such as solar power bc they may not make as much off of production & consumers. America behind in solar use.
3983 2018-01-27 22:16:59 @aatestac terebic pertaining to or obtained from terbenthene oil oftur1517091437643

3985 2018-01-27 22:16:43 People raging over breadfruit and oil you expect them to be civil over carnival? You know us better than that lol
3986 2018-01-27 22:16:43 I doubt it. More like apologizing for your race baiting. The good people of Zimbabwe dont need you your snake oil and lies.
3987 2018-01-27 22:16:34 Grenadian Oil Down deary
3988 2018-01-27 22:16:33 I actually have found coconut oil to be the best. It’s super gentle and makes your makeup glide off without being to harsh to your skin
3989 2018-01-27 22:16:18 Sssooooo JBCO at least once a week. Definitely for oil treatment
3990 2018-01-27 22:16:17 No. You can do it in a Dutch oven or cast iron frying pan. But you really should have a thermometer to try and keep the oil temp consistent. Which involves some fiddling with heat level on the stove while you cook.
3991 2018-01-27 22:16:15 Join our campaign.....we really are making a difference- but it's all about people power 
3992 2018-01-27 22:15:33 I’d oil them up

3994 2018-01-27 22:15:19 That oil is pretty good for black marks as well.
3995 2018-01-27 22:14:56 If money cured depression I would've been happy a long time ago. But what helps me is pizza, what helps me is fish oil, what helps me is talking about it. Check out Keep Trying on Kindle.  #Depression
3996 2018-01-27 22:14:46 It's money they now receive.. as much or more than from their oil reserves. Take it away means they can't spend it. Plus, they will have all those extra mouths to feed. Yes, they would pay for it.
3997 2018-01-27 22:14:32 No pipelines no drilling blah blah blah ,now New England buying Russian oil . Blockheads or was this purposeful

3999 2018-01-27 22:14:29 @AthleticoMince @RealBobMortimer @profanityswan the joy I feel while listening to the athletico mince podcast is monumental. It’s a feeling like a nipper tasting dippers for the first time or the feeling after a fresh application of Pearsons brass hand oil
4000 2018-01-27 22:14:11 4th coat of teak oil , it's gonna chill until I hand rub tomorrow morning

El asunto es q esta corrupción no rompe españa,nos da por culo pero es un mal menor asumible,no?
4004 2018-01-27 22:13:42 Lack of hub oil would be one very easy way to spot this, also signs of fatigue on the hub. While driving, smoke and a wobbling wheel

4007 2018-01-27 22:13:11 Trump retweeted this - after he decided that drilling for oil everywhere is okay...
4008 2018-01-27 22:13:11 Man, I’ll change my tires, put gas, change the oil, hand wash my car, but I absolutely hate putting air in the tires lmao idk why 
4009 2018-01-27 22:13:09 Only ideological @NDP and @liberal_party supporters cling to the notion that O&G industry needs to be diminished in Alberta. We have over a third of the world's probable recoverable Oil within our borders. It will be #1 for us for generations.
4010 2018-01-27 22:13:09 Just search oil down, you must get some

4013 2018-01-27 22:12:44 I carry peanut butter in my backpack and today I realized that I didn’t shut it correctly...so now there’s PB oil all over my stuff  including my jacket. Anyone know how to get it off?
4014 2018-01-27 22:12:40 I refuse to defer to the Crown Oil Arena
4015 2018-01-27 22:12:35 Hamburgers. Literally just two quarter pound burgers, seasoned with salt/pepper and cooked over vegetable oil.
4016 2018-01-27 22:12:16 We threw canola oil for fuel into our (old) trucks at work.
Smells like Pommes frites while driving 
4017 2018-01-27 22:11:54 I used tea tree oil on mine 
4018 2018-01-27 22:11:51 Oils are the greatest.  They say that acrylics dry out too fast.  I remember on my last day in 8th grade 40 years ago, my art teacher gave me a set of oil paints because I was such an aspiring artist!!
4019 2018-01-27 22:11:47 @EricShawnTV  Eric, American heartland doing just great, thank you for your concern. We sell our crops, oil, cotton, etc to you fancy east coast folks with all your newfound wealth
4020 2018-01-27 22:11:33 -Learn to play an instrument or make music using computer
-Start reading books about topics that interest you
-Learn to cook awesome dinners and invite friends for tasting
-Hand sketch or oil paint
-Photography (people/places/nature...)
-Write fiction or narratives

4021 2018-01-27 22:11:32 The early generation were not corrupt? Who does the natural resource wealth (oil) belong to? It is the public! Not the king or any Saudi royal family!
4022 2018-01-27 22:11:17 Nigeria is an oil producing country just like Angola. Let us soberly investigate why Angola with only 15% of our population is budgeting twice what we budgeted in 2018 and borrowing less than 60% what we are borrowing in the same year. Giant of Africa should not just be in mouth!
4023 2018-01-27 22:11:16 phga**nne**** sign-up as a Palm Oil trader from Yenagoa
4024 2018-01-27 22:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: moist crust with spicy coconut oil and apple wood smoked bacon.
4025 2018-01-27 22:11:01 Nice. It took awhile to respond cause I was doing research on Harley Dean and there was oil involved...so yeah...
4026 2018-01-27 22:10:45 Cultures without objectivity, that worship celebrity & infamy with sports fanaticism, allow for extreme abdication of responsibility.  It looks bonkers and a bit manic from a global perspective. #trade #tourism #oil #SOLAR

4032 2018-01-27 22:10:12 I never once demanded we unify.  I don't unify with a party that rigs & cheats & doesn't believe in democracy.  I don't unify with supporters of fracking, big oil, big pharma, prisons for slave labor and endless wars that are killing thousands of innocent people.
4033 2018-01-27 22:09:50 Now I wan taste oil down to see if it's worth the argument between Grenadians and Trinis rn.
4034 2018-01-27 22:09:42 To those shouting #RailaSwearingIn, don't forget we are not short of options. We are WAITING to POUNCE!
4035 2018-01-27 22:09:39 I came for an oil change and omg I’ve been here for like two hours already
4036 2018-01-27 22:09:24 受験票と筆箱と参考書と財布と定期と時計があれば何とかなるよな…
4037 2018-01-27 22:09:11 I’ve recently learned that a “Snake Oil” cocktail is bourbon, absinthe and syrup.

4038 2018-01-27 22:09:03 MY KITCHEN EXPLODED THERE'S OIL EVERYWHERE
4039 2018-01-27 22:08:52 Yes if you get unadulterated.

Also olive oil.

But they are expensive for the average person to cook with

4041 2018-01-27 22:08:39 To the drunk girl trying to explain Palm Oil, deforestation and orangutans to the drunk boy next to her by going ‘they’re just ginger little vegetarians that live in trees!’... You’re my hero.
4042 2018-01-27 22:08:39 THEY NAMED THEMSELVES AFTER THE OIL INDUSTRY THEY BROUGHT THIS ON THEMSELVES IT'S SUCH A DUMB NAME
4043 2018-01-27 22:08:25 Whole Foods has these crostini crackers w Rosemary in them,  tossed in olive oil and sea salt—they’re amazing
4044 2018-01-27 22:07:59 So a regular oil change and inspection turned into an all day repair and setback to the wallet 
4045 2018-01-27 22:07:50 CHANGE MY OIL PLZ ILL PAY XXXTRA

4048 2018-01-27 22:07:32 These oil marketers selling petrol above the official pump price in the day time as against their usual ways of selling in the evening

4054 2018-01-27 22:06:48 Words out of a man’s mouth, whose never served his country.  Evangelist=“snake oil salesman”
4055 2018-01-27 22:06:39 doesn't shock me at all that there are 'bookstores' in Nigeria.  there are a lot of Nigerian writers.  a library is a different thing.  a bibliotheque is a library in French.  as I said, 'oil rich' Nigeria doesn't commit to educating their kids.  hard to believe public libraries.
4056 2018-01-27 22:06:24 Hairdressers invisible oil?!!
4057 2018-01-27 22:06:16 We wont get a sniff of it. Westminster knew in 2014 how much oil Scotland had. They lied to the Scottish people so they could continue to what they have aways done to their colonies strip them of all their assets.

4061 2018-01-27 22:05:34 Wall is cutting out before the bodies float to the surface. The good oil price days are over.  When the going gets tough the opportunists bug out.
4062 2018-01-27 22:05:29 @Chilis has done the impossible. They make French fries taste awful because the oil is old. Why is it old? Probably to save money

4067 2018-01-27 22:04:54 @fondalacatrina Several Georgetown neighbors slipped and fell as a result of your employees unsafely leaving an oil spill outside the restaurant. Please remedy ASAP and make sure this never happens again.
4068 2018-01-27 22:04:49 Don't forget to take one spoon of coconut oil with every meal!
4069 2018-01-27 22:04:46 Do you know what's the most valuable commodity in the world these days? Not oil. Not gold, not diamonds. It's trust. (Salvation tv series, 2017)
4070 2018-01-27 22:04:34 I'm guessing just using oil, the menu board on the sidewalk said they were like three bucks
4071 2018-01-27 22:04:22 Smash box water primer and the oil primer are my absolute FAVES  and the lock it spray by Kay von D is awesome too but the NYX matte spray is a good dupe if you want something cheaper

4078 2018-01-27 22:03:35 Your understanding of history is lopsided, to say the least!
4079 2018-01-27 22:03:33 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
4080 2018-01-27 22:03:32 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames.
4081 2018-01-27 22:03:17 I usually wake up and wipe my face with witch hazel. Then I use one of those battery powered facial cleanser things with noxema as face wash and I was my face. I rinse it and pat it dry then I moisturize with Shea butter and bio oil.

4084 2018-01-27 22:03:10 Oh yea I forgot we were supposed to buy more oil fuel etc if she would've won, good try though, which would've raised fuel prices here in the U.S..
4085 2018-01-27 22:03:10 There aren't any checks unless you are in favor of the Standard Oil/AT&T solution of breaking up monopolies.   In the meantime you risk losing competitiveness to a centrally planned state like China.  So you pray that Bezos, Zuckenberg and Brin are benevolent dictators.
4086 2018-01-27 22:03:09 Check QB Kyle Lauletta's uniform for cooking oil.

4090 2018-01-27 22:02:56 AC changed "saloon" to "salon" in my cowboy friend's text to me, so now, instead of knocking back shots of whiskey with my "varmints", I'm leaning back in the barber's chair for a much needed, relaxing tea oil treatment.
4091 2018-01-27 22:02:38 I recommend growing for six months without touching. Get a dope boars hair brush, nothing too expensive just make sure it's boars hair. You can use the brush to control direction of growth. Get a nice beard oil too. Once you have some length get a beard balm for conditioning.
4092 2018-01-27 22:02:32 Sooner or later we'll get that big Sunday gap down that traps all the oil bulls.  Maybe tomorrow.
4093 2018-01-27 22:02:29 @knfilters put filter on tight and drove 6 miles. I noticed an oil trail when I got out of my SUV. When I restarted the vehicle oil was gushing from the filter seal. Thinking I just had not tightened it enough I snugged it up tight. Filter continued to back out and leak.
4094 2018-01-27 22:02:29 Love your positivity and your smile. Tea tree oil  gets rid of spots quick (from personal experience) x
4095 2018-01-27 22:02:20 Oil painting is cool but I rly like how fluid and easy to clean acrylic is

4106 2018-01-27 22:00:56 Really? It's not as if there were dozens of oil sands companies. GCOS, Syncrude.
4107 2018-01-27 22:00:48 يستاهلك الطيب،وكل خير 
4108 2018-01-27 22:00:38 You can put it on top of fake ones to blend natural into fake, use baby oil to get it off after you’ve used them

4110 2018-01-27 22:00:35 What the fuck is oil down
4111 2018-01-27 22:00:26 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
4112 2018-01-27 22:00:19 I don't know why, but it's an odd feeling being handed a free copy of your own newspaper while waiting for an oil change.
4113 2018-01-27 22:00:19 January 27, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
4114 2018-01-27 22:00:14 I can now stream wirelessly to my #Factorio map -- Added oil production, plastic bars, but jesus christ, this has to be the worse in awhile.
4115 2018-01-27 22:00:03 Try the caulifyrice medley if you haven’t already. I followed their directions for chicken fried rice and it was delicious!  I want to say it was Keto-friendly as written but I added sesame oil to mine.  Still..you can do a lot w/ the rice by itself!
4116 2018-01-27 21:59:58 Liberals buying oil from Russia and France to undermine our industry.
4117 2018-01-27 21:59:48 oil down
4118 2018-01-27 21:59:46 You do have nice hands & that’s definitely a thing. People who bite their nails or look like they’ve been playing in motor oil all the time concern me a little bit.
4119 2018-01-27 21:59:45 Hm, might even get back into suits. I gave up when they got to that Hessington Oil case that dragged for like 10 episodes
4120 2018-01-27 21:59:42 I burn the midnight oil tonight hoping for another #10 win.
4121 2018-01-27 21:59:40 Link? Which company?  Subsidizing to all companies across an entire industry is very different from keeping one specific company afloat with tax dollars over and over. Which Alberta oil company are you comparing to Bombardier?
4122 2018-01-27 21:59:36 تستاهل #دعاء 
4123 2018-01-27 21:59:36 Well I would have to think good. Charisma does not equal intelligence. The oil money dried up but Brad couldn’t quit spending. Big deficit may as well put the tail between the legs and retire. Go hang out with Grant Devine,
4124 2018-01-27 21:59:35 mineral oil on clear SLA prints? Oooh...
4125 2018-01-27 21:59:33 WHAT Bush thinks is irealevent!  He needs to paynattetions to his oil over seas!
4126 2018-01-27 21:59:21 So, Olbas oil stings if you get it in your eye 
4127 2018-01-27 21:59:20 I’ve never wanted a high end lip more than the @YSL oil you mentioned @JamiePBeauty 
4128 2018-01-27 21:59:18 91 was Bush's lie to save oil rich Kuwait. Who had a 15 year old lie of iraq's baby incubators.

4138 2018-01-27 21:58:09 Under performing govt tht build our foreing reserve by 100% whn oil price is low, defeated boko haram, end oil bunkering, reduce corruption, give us functional railway, created over 100k millionaires farmers, tht is cleaning 40 yrs pollution in N/Delta etc

4144 2018-01-27 21:55:59 I heard it's going to be a monorail . . . powered by snake oil !
4145 2018-01-27 21:55:54 Packaging is a secondary factor as long as the primary ingredient is available in abundant. 

If the FG is serious about diversifying our economy from oil to agriculture, this industry is one to look into.
4146 2018-01-27 21:55:46 Leave it to trump to take our country backward in every single way...women's rights, minority rights, climate change, ALL to payoff his male, racist, greedy friends in the oil industry.
4147 2018-01-27 21:55:29 Make sure your neck isn't stiff, because that causes headaches. You can use eucalyptus oil with a base oil (almond, vegetable, avocado, coconut, etc) on the back of your neck.  A cold compress on the head works too. You can try and freeze a headache out with ice cream. Lol
4148 2018-01-27 21:55:28 What are your thoughts on maracuja oil ??

4154 2018-01-27 21:54:22 You can use golden syrup (cane sugar derived) and refined coconut oil, no problem. They’ll taste just like the original.

4156 2018-01-27 21:53:59 You have nothing to worry about. 
You are White, your papers are hopefully, in order? You are compliant. You probably do not care about Climate Change or if all of our beaches are coated with oil sludge and dead animals?

4160 2018-01-27 21:53:26 What about #CBD oil or cream? Not just #hemp oil or cream. Check CBD content.
4161 2018-01-27 21:53:24 Yeah, my skin doesn’t like exfoliaters that much either and that’s smart to exfoliate whenever you need to. I hardly ever exfoliate at all and that’s not a good thing lol.  So last week I found a gentle scrub recipe on Pinterest and it calls for oatmeal, honey and almond oil or
4162 2018-01-27 21:53:24 Oil down
4163 2018-01-27 21:53:23 I guess the use of palm oil could be off putting as wild animals die out because of its production. But you can read about its use on the sticker, this doesn't really change anything.
4164 2018-01-27 21:53:13 Feverfew helps prevent and treat migraine headaches. White willow helps with headaches. For heat headaches, white willow and ginger root helps with inflammation and can help--that and eating apples. Massaging your temples with peppermint oil helps.
4165 2018-01-27 21:53:10 Glad middle schoolers are working on climate change. Good to see they're taking a stand - even if their elders haven't.

btw... did you let them know that last year you voted for allowing oil refineries to increase carbon emissions?

4170 2018-01-27 21:52:32 I feel for them. In the current shape of the leagues and teams they'll have to dig deeper into their pockets to stabilize their defense. The rate at which they're going down they might discover oil soon 
4171 2018-01-27 21:52:32 This Bio Oil has a great smell
4172 2018-01-27 21:52:18 I just walked by a woman in white mukluks. She was shopping for fancy olive oil. I hate this town.
4173 2018-01-27 21:51:38 We don’t have no cooking oil 
4174 2018-01-27 21:51:33 Motorcycles don't leak oil, they mark their territory.
4175 2018-01-27 21:51:31 Don’t be surprised by this result it’s happened the last two years!
And it will keep happening until a oil rich billionaire buys out fsg!!
4176 2018-01-27 21:51:22 Beginning of '99: Goldilocks, Us unemployment <4%, same tech frenzy, interest rates rising, oil rising (but $ also rising),  same scare of market overvaluation but still one more year to go before the melt down.

4179 2018-01-27 21:50:43 Yeah, looks like just east of the southern point is an oil well, possibly abandoned.
4180 2018-01-27 21:50:26 The budget for baby oil to appropriately lube up Dwayne Johnson's biceps in Fast Five must've rivalled the money they spent on some of the fucking cars

4185 2018-01-27 21:49:50 then what is sented oil made of?
4186 2018-01-27 21:49:41 I just want the British peoples who have inhabited the isles for millennia to retain, cultural, political and ethnic dominance within them. I never used to think about being white until the leftists and thefoolish among the minorities who have bought their snake oil went nuts.

4189 2018-01-27 21:49:25 @larrymiller have you forgotten about the Exxon Valdez! Why support pipelines to fuel the Far East why not pipelines to east and keep our oil here.

4193 2018-01-27 21:48:36 15. I believe in funding sustainable energy, including offering education to people currently working in coal or oil so they can change jobs.There are too many sustainable options available for us to continue with coal and oil. Sorry, billionaires. Maybe invest in something else

4197 2018-01-27 21:48:04 With very large oil fields
4198 2018-01-27 21:47:50 I wish that worked for me but my skin oil is "toxic" and causes me intense pain whenever I rub my eyes with anything other part of my skin... hmm, sounds quite bad now I've written it down
4199 2018-01-27 21:47:50 I'm sure none of us went hungry in order to support her either. Bernie will always be an opportunist who sells snake oil. The difference between Trump and him is that he isn't in the Oval Office or has casinos.

4209 2018-01-27 21:45:16 @rachmonroe I very much liked your New Yorker article on MLM essential oil companies.  Can sharing of questionable beliefs based on marketing techniques be considered lying?  A fad, essential oil is just another bubble to burst.  Just don't be holding a garage full of inflation.

It is all for the "petro dollar" oil was priced and traded in U.S. currency. Every nation who has threatened to go to the "gold standard" for oil has been destroyed by us.
Libya was one of several.

4235 2018-01-27 21:41:35 Ummmm Prentice told everyone the province was heading for debt. Because the oil industry was already going down prior to the election. Revisionist history helps no one.

(I've had a cold for two days and feel woozy and weak)
4254 2018-01-27 21:39:31 All I said was Trinidad Oil down...as in what I see here. Who knew it would have caused all this. Certainly not me!

4257 2018-01-27 21:38:51 Jesus, I thought it was the amount of sugar. She says it’s the oil. Jesus fuck they’re both so stupid of reasons. You could eat it and know instantly you dumb broad.

4264 2018-01-27 21:37:34 Wonderful? Is it oil painting?
4265 2018-01-27 21:37:25 Very true. But there aren't many legit arguments for it. 
Legit concerns; but Brexit is a snake oil solution.
Most amazing marketing ever. Take people's real concerns and persaude them to vote to make them worse.
Amazing

4269 2018-01-27 21:36:51 Remember the eighties when London yuppies made fortunes and waved their cash in the faces of the working poor while Scotland's unemployment rate doubled?
Turns out that was Scotland's new found oil wealth being squandered.

4271 2018-01-27 21:36:35 There is NOTHING called Trinidad Oil Down! 
I Said What I Said 
4272 2018-01-27 21:36:28 Agreed but from what I pick up in the Portuguese press (there's +- 500k Portuguese living there) it's more of a shambles than a revolution. Problem of course is the Oil! If it didn't have oil it would not be a flashpoint!

4275 2018-01-27 21:36:16 The EIA seems the least vested to $$$.  The least, not the 1.  OPEC+ has been clear in concern of a pending supply crunch, from low commodity prices dampening E&D.  This is plausible.  Green is a threat to oil, high oil costs stimulate green investment/use. Bad 4 OPEC+ stability.

4277 2018-01-27 21:35:26 Well it was out of curiosity LOL. But I posted it. My thing was that you can’t call something Oil down if it doesn’t look like it or taste like it. It was extremely soupy.
4278 2018-01-27 21:35:19 We build a wall it makes us look weak   My opinion  and it’s a waste of money cause there’s already a wall there. It’d probably cost less to have troops home and guarding our country instead of being in every other country installing banks oil and bringing drugs here

4282 2018-01-27 21:34:59 Oil is my friend.
4283 2018-01-27 21:34:53 The problem is the weak dollar. The dollar is down over 10% from last year. We import over $2 trillion/yr. That means we pay an additiinal 200b. That 200b is over 1% of GDP. Its going to hurt us for a while. Combined with higher oil and higher interest rates we have challenges
4284 2018-01-27 21:34:46 Haaa...congs @mildredtuhaise . You've dragged Dalton to the oil city. I hope he doesn't steal our land.
4285 2018-01-27 21:34:40 the roads are all plowed, I am trying to change that society to realize there are better investments for our money that improve health and well being, instead of benefiting residential developers, oil and gas, and automotive industries
4286 2018-01-27 21:34:37 What about priming and painting after using the oil, any issues of the paint sticking to the print because of the oil?
4287 2018-01-27 21:34:32 also because of transparency to the customer. It no longer matches the definition of milk. this happens with mayo too which is defined as oil, egg yolk, vinegar, but vegan “mayo” no longer fits the definition.

4290 2018-01-27 21:33:50 Time to shake up the TL with one question 

Who owns Oil Down?

4310 2018-01-27 21:31:46 The "too big to fail" has been applied to the boom-and-bust oil industry. I really object to the Alberta obsession with Quebec and Bombardier. It's do as we say but let's ignore what WE do.
4311 2018-01-27 21:31:28 Uh. No. Mining and oil companies destroy natural resources.  Pollute the environment. kill the Earth. Global warming. That leads to extreme weather. Superstorm hurricanes and tornadoes. Not nearly the same.

4371 2018-01-27 21:20:58 I agree on capital spending....but that's not the problem.  The problem is on operating expense that we are borrowing money to fund day-day ops.  Short term, that's fine...but we need resource revenue for that to continue...which means incenting a ton more oil and gas investment.

4382 2018-01-27 21:18:41 Yes, Northstream 2. The reason the USA is putting every effort in alienating Russia from the rest of Europe. They want Rosneft and Gazprom from the European market so they can sell their Shale gas to us and Israel their gas from Leviathan and oil from the Golan Heights.

4413 2018-01-27 21:13:30 Yes. It was at a time when the oil price was low and Govt said it was no longer paying subsidy as the landing cost is lower that the pump price. The tweet was predicated on that I think.

4424 2018-01-27 21:12:38 I’m not aware of one credible analyst projecting imminent EV adoption. Hear it from a TSLA bull: EV’s will not dent oil demand in the next several years.

4429 2018-01-27 21:12:00 I don't believe one side can tell the other how to behave. My problem is when men believe they can tell women how to act. I was a housewife, I worked for a large oil company and I do believe that women can be whatever they want to be. Stop telling others how to act. Let them be.

4445 2018-01-27 21:10:29 We are using much more NG now than coal and reducing oil percentage. If you want to believe what comes out of our nose is destroying us, you are probably Godless anyway so have at us. Bottom line is more CO2= more plant life and warmer=longer growing season, more food

4459 2018-01-27 21:09:10 Many don't understand the quality inherent in red oil.

It is seen as the poor man's oil.
4460 2018-01-27 21:09:02 has been conducted that proves regular consumption of olives and olive oil contributes to heart, brain skin and joint health. They have even been linked to cancer and diabetes prevention. Needless to say, this sacred foodstuff has lived up to its ancient reputation!
4461 2018-01-27 21:08:58 We are 35 mln people in one of the most-resource rich places on earth, from oil and natural gas to freshwater and arable land, etc. No empirical basis for resource scarcity fear in Can.

4468 2018-01-27 21:08:22 There is no strategy that is guaranteed to work in human worlds. Nor is there a method/toolset for creating such strategies. Put differently almost every business book on strategy is snake oil for analyticals addicted to the myth that the world is square/linear not wiggly.
4469 2018-01-27 21:08:11 Thanks @DeiruSan. It was actually throw-away comment about how unappetising the volume of oil looked. You probably didn't need to be quite so patronising.

4536 2018-01-27 20:56:16 Gonna share a secret for best cookies ever, no fuss no mess.Take any box cake mix,add 2 eggs, 1 stick butter or 1/2 cup oil. Bake 325 for 12 min. Done.
4537 2018-01-27 20:56:15 All I wanted to do was make some fries...Why did the oil have to pop me on thigh 5 times  can't trust nothing these days lol
4538 2018-01-27 20:55:56 Grow a beard! I love it! Right now I have a faded goattee look, it's the best. Get yourself some beard oil and a beard comb and grow it out!
4539 2018-01-27 20:55:45 I think this oil company is doing good if only tecco would release all the info he has especially the notes and any acquisition he has planned or any he had completed he keeps promising info but doesn't deliver he was supposed to have already given us all the info before now
4540 2018-01-27 20:55:37 Dada no go change the fact say you be lighthead. Igbo go still fall you guy
4541 2018-01-27 20:55:37 instead of that fluoride toothpaste use coconut oil to clean and detoxify ur mouth. OIL PULLING

Let's hope It's like an assr coach replacing the head coach ( best case scenario Cassidy replacing Julien )They worked together but it turned out BC had his own ideas.

4547 2018-01-27 20:53:57 To the men that aren’t into DARKSKIN WOMEN.... Listen up ” Go get you some coconut oil, and a darkskin woman” RUB IT ON HERE and tell me what happened next you welcome my nigga
4548 2018-01-27 20:53:49 The economy is growing, here try my wine. Snake oil salesmanship at its best.
4549 2018-01-27 20:53:26 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
4550 2018-01-27 20:53:25 I like to use tea tree oil or peppermint oil but make sure it’s diluted because it’s really  strong by itself
4551 2018-01-27 20:53:23 Unbelievable, and Trump wants coal jobs to come back ! We are still subsidizing the oil industry. He's destroying the EPA along with its environmental protections. Time to check his campaign donor's contributions.
4552 2018-01-27 20:53:23 Oh, I see.  That makes sense as it gives you a way to check yourself.  Sounds good!
No more shots from the peanut gallery.  Thank you Todd,  Todd.  LOL

4554 2018-01-27 20:53:04 Ur propaganda omits very important facts!Turkey preferred ISIS along its border inside Syria bcuz trucksloads of stolen oil was cheap!Those around the world wanting to join ISIS had access through that exact border,so b sure deals were made!There r no more deals to b made w/Kurds
4555 2018-01-27 20:52:54 Or spaghetti aglio e olio - sautéed garlic mixed through spaghetti with oil. So simple but delicious. You can also add chilli to that
4556 2018-01-27 20:52:52 I overdid the apricot oil on my body. I smell like yogi sip...hello Mosquitoes
4557 2018-01-27 20:52:48 Awesome!

(My brain also went 'What could possibly go wrong on a offshore oil rig?' *rubs hands* ;))
4558 2018-01-27 20:52:46 Oil price is rising. We will spend it on ghost infrastructure like we spent N2.4tn in two years. What do you need Davos for?

4560 2018-01-27 20:52:35 Deregulation and price was fixed throughout his entire tenure? Lmaooooo. By 2015, oil marketers were  on a strike following dispute over subsidy on petrol.

He promised to develop Nigeria's refining capacity, throughout his 5 years, Refineries were grounded but he is not foolish
4561 2018-01-27 20:52:09 How crass of BP to even publish this They should be ashamed And whose oil is it anyway No doubt the facts lost in translation 
4562 2018-01-27 20:52:08 Also a sandwich bun or two. Cut your bun open, put olive oil on one side & sprinkle with dried oregano. Put ajvar, meat & cheese on the other side. Toast until cheese is melty & other side of bread toasted.
4563 2018-01-27 20:52:04 I hope you are ready for the next tournament
4564 2018-01-27 20:51:31 He who pays the zippers dictate the tune.
Soon, the so called oil will be worthless, no thanks to technology
4565 2018-01-27 20:51:27 Higher oil and gas prices benefit the boss 
4566 2018-01-27 20:51:17 Im glad I can fix my truck and do things to it myself instead of taking it to a shop to get an oil change like my friends do smh they won’t know the feeling you get when you do it yourself

4574 2018-01-27 20:50:08 I don't know your sandwich-making skill level but here's a really easy Italian sandwich. You'll need a jar of ajvar (red pepper & eggplant spread), some salami and/or hot sopressata and/or ham, some slices of provolone, olive oil & oregano.
4575 2018-01-27 20:50:08 next time burst it with a stick and throw it in water, you'd swear the stick is having an oil leak lol
4576 2018-01-27 20:49:58 Damn right mate, the snake oil salesman did us up a treat. They’re laughing all the way to the bank....
4577 2018-01-27 20:49:51 why in 2018 if I want a fried egg do I have to fry an egg? why is no one selling prefried eggs? they come in like a tuppawear pot full of oil, you take um out drain um off, zap in the microwave. done.

4585 2018-01-27 20:48:59 ...anyways, I ended up with a migraine this morning & nearly blinded myself with eucalyptus oil. I got that shit in the corner of each eye & looked like I’d been hitting the reefer all night long.

4588 2018-01-27 20:47:57 and still not capacity to refine its oil....

4591 2018-01-27 20:47:51 Please try to take care of yourself and consider talking to your doctor! If you need something to help with the vomiting, sometimes I’ve used 2 drops of peppermint oil in a cup of cool water. Only do it when you have to though, too much peppermint oil can give you heartburn
4592 2018-01-27 20:47:38 Laura Walkers salary is almost $900,000/year?  Canceled my membership, all these years I've thought of this organization as grassroots, now I see they are more like big pharma & big oil.  Hypocrites, I feel like a fool.
4593 2018-01-27 20:47:32 I don’t need asking twice, I wouldn’t be able to contain myself as my hands will already be giving rubbing the oil in
4594 2018-01-27 20:47:30 Putting premium oil in your cars, but junk food in your bodies.  #health #nutrition it's important
4595 2018-01-27 20:47:15 Changing an oil pressure sensor in a Chevy Silverado is actually terrible
4596 2018-01-27 20:47:12 In effetti il catalano è molto simpatico come lingua. A leggerlo rimani un po’ scioccato ma a sentirlo è molto bello. Simo tu che sei andata a sQuola: ma sarebbe una variante della lingua d’Oc? Ti ricordi in V ginnasio lingua d’oc e d’oïl...
4597 2018-01-27 20:47:08 That’s an investment of 35 days of oil exports at current price. Amortize it over many years. A foreign bank would probably do it. Think: China.
4598 2018-01-27 20:47:01 Im sorry! I hope you feel better! Try lavendar and peppermint oil(if you have any) also, THC/CBD lotion helps a lot.
4599 2018-01-27 20:46:41 Buhari is petroleum minister. If he can't change the fortunes of the oil industry that is directly his personal responsibility, forget it, Buhari can't fix Nigeria. I can't understand why selfish people are routing for a second term for incompetence
4600 2018-01-27 20:46:38 I’m trying to remove the grease from my fingers now.  Might give @chemicalguys CLD_201_16 Extreme Orange, to clean up the aftermath.  Wish I had one of those pads you use, for under my cover around the oil filler.  Got some fresh 5w30.  Lookin good today.
4601 2018-01-27 20:46:12 i've got some a mixture of CBD oil and a high-nicotine ejuice in my vape, and combined they create a dizzy buzz that's kinda like a really shitty high
4602 2018-01-27 20:46:02 Butter mixed in with the beef. 

No egg, no bread. 
Just butter, paprika, garlic powder, onion, beef.

Fried, no oil, not on a grill.

Add cheese, pickles, brioche bun. Sauce made from yellow mustard, mayo, some raw onions, pickles (peanuts sometimes).

4607 2018-01-27 20:45:34 We understand completely.  We understand, they want to make us happy as long as they can.  Bless your hearts  lavender oil is calming...
4608 2018-01-27 20:45:33 yea, hummus is basically chickpea and oil. but you can add stuff like carrots and even mushrooms (I'd cook those first).

if you get white kidney beans I don't think they make you fart as much, lol. they're also good against high cholesterine so... healthy and nutritious.
4609 2018-01-27 20:45:28 Man. The options are endless. I like to sauté a bunch of chopped garlic with olive oil then toss in diced onion, peppers and tomato then put inside an omelette... you can do a garlic confit and spread it on bread... mix with some fresh tomato, basil and evoo and put on toast
4610 2018-01-27 20:45:22 O3- derived mainly from fish & fish oil (anti-inflammatory)
O6-mainly from processed vegetable/seed oils (pro-inflammatory) & the ones recommended by health authorities. #fail
4611 2018-01-27 20:45:21 I’m just hurt myself trying to open a bottle of olive oil years old
4612 2018-01-27 20:45:03 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
4613 2018-01-27 20:44:40 I'm just gonna go watch Xena the Warrior Princess or a drop of olive oil fall off a spoon.
4614 2018-01-27 20:44:37 My last relationship is ended before its bloom when the guy invested in oil and forgot about to tell me. It was long ago, no way back!
4615 2018-01-27 20:44:32 That Buhari eventually took Jonathan route doesn't make that tweet invalid. Tell me the reforms Jonathan pursued in the Oil sector aside the fact that he hiked the Price of fuel in January of 2012.

4647 2018-01-27 20:39:00 Lmao thanks! I believe in double cleansing which is basically washing ur face 2x. Best if u start with something oil based & then follow up with a water based one (non foaming & low ph). Then i layer 2 watery toners, top with serum & finish with cream!
4648 2018-01-27 20:38:55 you go to get an oil change, they start telling you all kinda other shit. look man, i’m just here for an oil change, dassit.

4650 2018-01-27 20:37:35 Russia's GDP is still smaller than France. Smaller than California. And yet it is awash with natural resources from gas and oil to chrome to diamonds and gold. Where is all the money going? Bank of Cyprus?
4651 2018-01-27 20:37:33 Wow, snake oil salesmen in 2018. Nothing changes i guess
4652 2018-01-27 20:37:28 I guess they don’t have to hide out in the middle of the ocean filling up their oil tankers anymore.
4653 2018-01-27 20:37:27 Me too. Especially roasted, with olive oil and spices. Or even just salt and pepper.
4654 2018-01-27 20:37:27 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.

4673 2018-01-27 20:33:17 Putin perceived Ukraine-EU getting closer as a breach from am (don't know explicit) agreement that the easter border of EU influence stopped at the Polish/Ukrainian border. He wanted the Ukraine to stay under RU influence. It's probably more about resources (gas, oil, minerals).
4674 2018-01-27 20:33:08 MrH has a cold. A proper one. There are tissues, headache oil, a hot water bottle, and everything.

4677 2018-01-27 20:32:04 It's amazing and interesting how people like or hate different things in their food.

Some can't stand crayfish, Iru, pepper, others want serious pepper or olive oil instead of vegetable oil. 

I enjoy cooking with all their quirks, allergies, likes and dislikes
4678 2018-01-27 20:31:50 Aye I scream out with this. De fack wrong with it? That could ever be oil down? Fuck no!!! This comment win!!!!
4679 2018-01-27 20:31:39 Turns out thine car is still leaking oil & I'm not completely sure from where this time around. 
Next paycheck can't come soon enough, car needs some major fixing. :(

4686 2018-01-27 20:30:40 Some of the larger estimates of oil reserves are in the region of £1.5t - isnt it funny that the UK lost its A+++ credit rating when its debt passed this figure .......

4691 2018-01-27 20:30:01 The bottom compartment must hold burning gas/oil/alcohol and on the top part where the flames formed you have the metal screen or grid
4692 2018-01-27 20:30:01 Did you know that "the first to show satellite images of Turkish soldiers' buying and selling oil for weapons with terrorists was Russia? Real photo and not photohop as you imagine '' any way ' Turkey support terrorist
4693 2018-01-27 20:29:39 Yes Pete I worry constantly about irreversible environmental damage.  I think of it as something innocent, ravaged by man.  I think of oil wells in parks.  Makes me so depressed & feeling powerless.
4694 2018-01-27 20:29:34 I would only get toilet paper and stuff for smoothies. Or coconut oil. Occasionally frozen meat. Otherwise? No point
4695 2018-01-27 20:29:21 I got my oil changed today like a fuckin adult. It was. Underwhelming and very boring. And I cannot be trusted in a Canadian tire for 40 min bc I will buy kitchen things
4696 2018-01-27 20:29:15 Oil change 
4697 2018-01-27 20:28:54 I liked the mince tip (buying the one with a bit more fat and not using cooking oil) and cutting celery from the top rather than removing a stalk at a time.
4698 2018-01-27 20:28:46 Very nice! Just checked one out today while getting an oil change on my current Dodge Durango.  Really like the white and black.
4699 2018-01-27 20:28:41 wait Nutella has palm oil???

4702 2018-01-27 20:28:31 Fashion sense. Correction,  but we expect a leader for our future. Who recognizes Oil and gas proliferation, is not our future. Talk nice walk nice , but give our freedom to choose how we vote, who we make those big deals with,not back room deals with human rights abusers
4703 2018-01-27 20:28:12 Meh. Same empty stadium and oil baron owners.
4704 2018-01-27 20:28:11 Yeah that was pretty crazy, the salah one was very 50/50 coz he was never getting the ball. Ref must have bn in mental term oil, thinking its not really a pen but everyone is looking at this
4705 2018-01-27 20:28:07 Well Done putting this out to the twitterverse.  Remember “Lorenzo’s Oil”?  Nobody can bring the necessary people together to solve the problem—better than those most impacted by it!!!
4706 2018-01-27 20:28:02 @NGRPresident discussing how you'll sink another billion of dollars to search for oil in lake Chad basin or what.
4707 2018-01-27 20:28:02 this is my Bad Day Steak recipe:
-lil bit of oil in the pan, super hot.
-skirt steak + s&P, 4 min on one side, three min on the other, let it rest
-throw some wine, shallots, and cold butter in the pan (hardy herbs if you have them), let it reduce
-eat in the kitchen standing up

4712 2018-01-27 20:27:04 If the breed of GOP members making our lives hell had it their way, we would resemble China- 

In that there would be overpopulation worse than it is (no reproductive choices) and the land would all be gone, with lack of farmland as well (opening our nat'l parks to big oil & gas)

4758 2018-01-27 20:25:41 It's a lot of hard work and effort undoubtedly. I'm questioning why some careers are seen as more worthy than others. Why do you get a title for academia but not for working on an oil rig, or on the bins, or running a business.
4759 2018-01-27 20:25:29 What a lovely treat it would be to try  #Lemon & Sea Buckthorn Night Oil win #comp #giveaway #Competition #prize #goodluck #FreebieFriday #skincare #vegan

4761 2018-01-27 20:25:19 Oil derricks and solar wind towers just off the coast of Mar-a-Lago.  I'm sure it would increase the value. 
4762 2018-01-27 20:25:18 i changed my own oil today and what i learned is that it's 100% worth it just to pay someone to do it for me
4763 2018-01-27 20:25:00 I love Paris aussi. Bill worked in the oil and gas industry with Technip based at La Defense    Had a flat in Villiers(17th).  Can’t really speak French but excellent shopper in French. We go back regularly to catch up with friends. Thinking of going October this year

4767 2018-01-27 20:24:12 Lmao right ALL sweet stuff has a crazy amount of sugar in!!! I think the oil had really surprised ppl but like, yeah? It doesnt have that consistency by magic?
4768 2018-01-27 20:24:06 Has it got palm oil/fat in it?

4771 2018-01-27 20:23:25 When do the Native Americans get the same remembrance? More native tribes were slaughtered in our history and yet they have no special holiday. Instead Trump is shrinking their tribal lands in the name of oil exploration.

4778 2018-01-27 20:22:45 I think you must have a "zero sum gain" point-of-view of life & economics. You should read/listen to "The Rational Optimist."  You do realize that the Robber Barons of the past made life better for nearly all in the US by bringing down the prices of railway travel/oil... right?

4781 2018-01-27 20:22:21 Net importers when Alberta has an abundance of coal. That makes as much sense as Canada importing OPEC oil when it currently has the world's 3rd largest reserve. My God, politicians are stupid. #cdnpoli
4782 2018-01-27 20:21:44  Bonus. Just see that Whiteheads only uses veg oil too. This is twice the options we usually have.
4783 2018-01-27 20:21:27 Simple question, if that were indeed the case, how does trading Hall for Larsson  help this team 4 or 5 yrs from the time the deal was made? If that were the goal, as you are suggesting, the move would've been for futures.
4784 2018-01-27 20:21:22 The statement was about trading oil in US dollars. Not the actual oil...

4794 2018-01-27 20:19:51 Conservatives fiscal policy of putting all our tax $ into Alberta & oil left us hanging when oil tanked. Better to diversify & Not repeat tulip fiasco

4807 2018-01-27 20:17:51 Same here. God forbid a spread has oil and sugar.
4808 2018-01-27 20:17:47 Global EV fleet translates into ~.04% of current oil demand...red herring similar to Peak Oil craze circa 2006-08

4816 2018-01-27 20:17:04 At least 2 Minnesota panel companies have tried and failed already. We waited too long to join the renewable energy revolution and let China get way ahead. We can thank climate change deniers and politicians owned by coal and oil for that. It’s unlikely the US will ever compete

4820 2018-01-27 20:16:19 It isn't oil. LNG. The G is for gas. Know your chemistry or whatever. It's a GAS.
4821 2018-01-27 20:16:19 On the other hand, wouldn’t the right signal to check for rather be “energy production > energy demand”, guaranteeing lowest *marginal* co2 emissions (gas, oil and other short-term energy sources will thus be turned off)?

4827 2018-01-27 20:15:24 I think she just realized she was on CNN.
4828 2018-01-27 20:15:03 Omg does it work with olive oil? That’s amazing thank you so much
4829 2018-01-27 20:14:48 I need to go for oil and brake fluid =u=
4830 2018-01-27 20:14:46 In the day our mum use to put baby oil on us ..we literally roasted
4831 2018-01-27 20:14:30 I emulžn for draj/oil skin
4832 2018-01-27 20:14:26 Think my check engine light just came on because I need an oil change and been putting it off. Damn I wish my stepdaddy was here 
4833 2018-01-27 20:14:15 while my clothes were in the washer I got an oil change and when they were drying I got a car wash. lmao most productive 2 hours ever

4835 2018-01-27 20:14:09 You use coconut oil and swish it around for 10-20 minutes( yes that long) in your mouth before you brush your teeth or eat anything and it helps get rid of all the bad toxins in your mouth and on your teeth, prevents cavities, has lots of good benefits for your teeth
4836 2018-01-27 20:13:38 Baby oil worked wonders for my boys 
4837 2018-01-27 20:13:33 If anyone knows of a candle or oil that actually smells like burning leaves and isn’t just called “Campfire”, hit ya girl up

4840 2018-01-27 20:12:56 lead us to salvation, pour that oil please
4841 2018-01-27 20:12:52 Yes, Norway is poster-child for talking climate-safe but extracting climate-dangerous. Norway: oil/cap down, gas/cap up, no coal = 75tCO2/cap 1990 to 100 now. Same +35% as Canada. But AB maybe closer analogy (similar pop & gdp). AB oilsands/cap 26 tCO2 in 1990 --> 120 now. +400%
4842 2018-01-27 20:12:42 either they keep the USD as a forex reserve (Russia, Saudi), in which case even if they had sold in local currency they would have swapped to USD, or they swap back to local currency and someone else holds the dollars instead (Canada). No net demand is created from oil either way
4843 2018-01-27 20:12:31 my parents smelled the tea tree oil on my face and thought a chemical leaked into the house
4844 2018-01-27 20:12:06 use castor or olive oil on them it helps to grow them. tbh i mostly use a drugstore / superdrug level eyebrow pencil or a brown/black eyeshadow but you genuinely don't need expensive brand products to make them look good just look at tutorials
4845 2018-01-27 20:12:02 Just know I was smoking this hash oil shit from Cali lastnight outta am e cig and my asss was straight slumped after 3 hits ... 100 hits later I was stuck
4846 2018-01-27 20:11:47 What about your executives giving up their private jet? How many oil companies fund you? Easy to talk the talk boys
4847 2018-01-27 20:11:41 Unfortunately you can’t point to any policies and prove your point. For example: 
Oil prices are up because of the carbon tax.
Unemployment is down because the carbon tax.
Birth rates are up because of the carbon tax.
Suicide rates are up because of the carbon tax.
Get it?

4850 2018-01-27 20:11:19 Oh I guess palm oil is bad for deforestation or something???  I don't think this is what they're shocked about though...
4851 2018-01-27 20:11:12 Islamists terrorize the world but EU & UK demand capitulation of #Israel just because Muslims used to West prostituting for their oil & money; many ignore history of Jesus, a Jewish reformist, who practiced Judaism in Jerusalem the capital of the ancient Judea- hence the name Jew
4852 2018-01-27 20:11:09 Hoy explota Fuel Oil??
4853 2018-01-27 20:11:03 GOP doesn't play by the rules. Somehow they think they are made of rubber (bounces off) but they are made of snake oil

4855 2018-01-27 20:10:40 When quick lube oil change shops try to upsell me everything. Glad I work as a technician and know my car doesn't need any of it.
4856 2018-01-27 20:10:40 I used the same, the 100% refined coconut oil, I used the butcher boys brand. The taste isn’t bad, it barely has a taste. It’s something I feel like you gotta get used to though loln
4857 2018-01-27 20:10:35 I used to coat mine daily in baby oil just to make it managable. Lol
4858 2018-01-27 20:10:27 Get the softest skin ever by smoothing on baby oil in the shower after washing or add a few drops of baby oil in your body wash and shake!
4859 2018-01-27 20:10:26 ＢＢひでえよ…(泣
4860 2018-01-27 20:10:25 Like, I can understand and objection to palm oil specifically due to unsustainable harvesting practices leading to extreme deforestation in tropical rainforest nations specifically, but, like, c'mon. This is just silly.
4861 2018-01-27 20:10:19 31/...totally isn't the case.  God made that dog bark non-stop & sent me into an insane rage & had me grab a jug of oil & forcefully dump it down that dog's throat.  I immediately knew what I did was wrong but I'm positive the entire situation was controlled by God.  Even though
4862 2018-01-27 20:10:13 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。

4866 2018-01-27 20:08:23 We’ve passed peak oil and shale is “shaking it off”

4870 2018-01-27 20:07:03 Far is starting the first oil exploration later this year and they opened an office in the petroleum house and employed Gambians.
4871 2018-01-27 20:07:01 "Vegan with no oil or salt"?

What the hell?

Vegan is great, but who the hell tries to live without fat and salt?
4872 2018-01-27 20:06:46 They will cut everything and everywhere for palm oil; it's really scary and it is pissed me off!
4873 2018-01-27 20:06:35 On my way back from Islamiyya I met a secondary school mate of mine,she called out on me,n I advanced towards her n gave me the thumbs  sign,then said I know say u no go shake me thats y I no extend my hand,most girls in my street think I'm an extremist fr not shaking them
4874 2018-01-27 20:06:01 I am the only negro still at the office burning the midnight oil smh.
4875 2018-01-27 20:05:49 Remember the actions of the UNITED STATES against indigenous people practicing their religion in 2017.  The oil industry doesn’t deserve protection against human rights abuses either.
4876 2018-01-27 20:05:46 Got to love when you get an oil change and the mechanic overfills it....#YouHadOneJob
4877 2018-01-27 20:05:42 Actually, at least as far back as HW, who is the son of Prescott Bush who got rich off of selling oil to the Nazis.
4878 2018-01-27 20:05:35 Yes thieves oil is one of the best oils to fight bacteria, my mom has been using it for years. Frankincense is another good one but it’s super expensive
4879 2018-01-27 20:05:27 Trump?  The fat Bavarian Nazi?  The dead beat who can only get loans from the Russians through Deutchebank because he doesn't pay his debts.  Let him sell you some more snake oil!

4892 2018-01-27 20:03:32 So...you stay in your car for oil changes now...?
4893 2018-01-27 20:03:10 This looks like another form of snake oil! Phony!

4896 2018-01-27 20:02:54 That is the second problem, the "manual crew" here thinks autos are like manuals for "gear oil" I am shocked at how many auto boxes they blow up! For instance, my Chrysler takes the same +4 as Benz, NOT +3, even the mechanics here are clueless.
4897 2018-01-27 20:02:50 Coconut oil helps with makeup stains and you can use oxi clean to soak the whole outfit
4898 2018-01-27 20:02:47 The @NRA isn't making the country unsafe. It's the criminals, domestic abusers, and dangerous mentally ill. Dems don't want us talking about the real causes of violence, so they push gun control snake oil and blame the NRA. It's shameful. #gunsense
4899 2018-01-27 20:02:43 I wonder how it would taste; veggie stock instead of meat juices/stock and switch the butter in the roux out for vegetable or olive oil
4900 2018-01-27 20:02:37 days it all really, who else could lose money on oil when all around the others make plenty

4903 2018-01-27 20:02:26 While I work mainly in oil & objective, narrative painting, I tend to favor nonobjective, abstract art, particularly the NY AbEx movement of the 40s & 50s, as well as the pre-revolution Russian constructivists & suprematists.

4906 2018-01-27 20:02:25 Oil!! Rub some oil to the dick. It helps dissolve the hot chili oils. Milk won't help enough. Then wash the dick with dish soap, it dissolves oils. If these won't help make a thick paste of baking soda and water and apply it directly to dick, let dry and wash off.

4912 2018-01-27 20:01:47 I used to make loads of money out of oil and gas.
4913 2018-01-27 20:01:37 Now that...that's precious. An oil painter I follow on Instagram told me he found my work inspiring; so much so, that he told his younger daughter to follow me and be inspired. It's easy to get wrapped in an art bubble, never planning to make an impact; I never expected that

4934 2018-01-27 19:59:39 I did a Hannibal Lecter this evening, cooked and ate a fantastic liver with fava beans and a glass of chianti.

*disclaimer* the liver was calves liver not human

Pro tip from the butcher: olive oil and lemon juice, searing hot pan, 2 minutes on each side 
4935 2018-01-27 19:59:26 About as similar as oil and water. Clue: these two things are not the same. #Eejit
4936 2018-01-27 19:59:25 Oooh yeah, that's important. I forgot to mention that the coconut oil is mostly for my hair/scalp (dry scalp hell) (gonna try it for under eyes tho). I don't really like using olive oil for anything but my hair tbth. o:
4937 2018-01-27 19:59:14 I agree...lot of complacency around the $40-60 range that we r supposed to trade in forever.

4945 2018-01-27 19:58:02 This is such a stereotypical response to this from someone who works in petrochemicals. 

"Lol u hate oil but do u drive a car? Checkmate hippies trolololol"
4946 2018-01-27 19:57:43 Yeah, momentum slowly turning. Energy sector share of total mkt cap was 5.5% at oil low ($26 - 2/16)...it’s 5.6% today ($70+ Brent)...still an underweight for most generalists/PMs.
4947 2018-01-27 19:57:36 Miners took canaries into mines because when the canaries started dying the knew they would too. So Americans when big oil starts killing birds you're next.

4953 2018-01-27 19:57:06 Yes you're right. Think of the lives you could save by investing in new energy solutions for our country and planet. You could be the greatest president we ever had if you did that. I smell the stench of oil in Big Springs, Tx and it's gross. A new untapped energy is out there!
4954 2018-01-27 19:57:05 First oil change and tire rotation 
4955 2018-01-27 19:56:58 MAXYPOOOOOO

4957 2018-01-27 19:56:44 That would make it harder to steal their oil.

The only language that the Nigerian State understands is "take it by force if you can"! 

Nobody thinks about how deplorable your community has become and the pains the people are going through as the result of oil exploration activities.
4965 2018-01-27 19:55:58 I think that the United States can pull this off. Especially if we reduce our military spending budget and our oil/mineral mining budget.
4966 2018-01-27 19:55:56 You temporarily dismantle CITY HALL to free up all the canpower available to create a vigilant TOWN MILITIA. You divide them into two groups, marking them with distinct teams and ranks using the piece of white CHALK and the MOTOR OIL.
4967 2018-01-27 19:55:55 Easiest thing in the world. Slice potatoes up into thin fries, stick them in a bowl with a drizzle of oil, plenty of salt and some herbs, mix it all around so they're coated. Then bake on a tray for 20-30 mins. Works nicely with sweet pots too. :)
4968 2018-01-27 19:55:49 Oil & gas will do everything in their power to make sure this does not happen ie Trump’s tax war on solar. Do not give oil & gas the power to succeed. Fight for solar.

4970 2018-01-27 19:55:39 Anyone out here use jojoba oil as a moisturizer? I know you’re only supposed to use a few drops of it but is that enough?
4971 2018-01-27 19:55:29 @ShawnModel Question- In order for body to use MCT oil as quick energy source when added to salad, coffee, etc, does body need to be in ketosis already?

4978 2018-01-27 19:54:25 Just be careful of coconut oil as moisturizer !!! It's comedogenic so if you're prone to breakouts it will clog your pores!! I use it only on my eyes/lips to take off makeup or to moisturize my undereyes (because the skin there is thin so it's okie)
4979 2018-01-27 19:54:21 Yu can put in in like grease or however yu oil your hair . On wet or dry hair

4995 2018-01-27 19:51:39 That's a very high percentage of oil theft and this results in the reduction of oil quantity and revenue.
4996 2018-01-27 19:51:30 'Reserves' are a function of price. When prices rise more oil becomes viable & vice versa. A complementary UK 'energy as a service' market is needed alongside the manipulated Brent oil benchmark #EnergyIndependence

5003 2018-01-27 19:50:51 The IPO is MbS’s gift to the people. He wants everyone to feel that they are entitled to a slice of the oil revenue.

5018 2018-01-27 19:49:17 Well in the same way that Angola's state owned oil industry isn't Socialism. (it's basically the private bank account of the Dos Santos) 

Neither is the Venezuelan regime's. The EZLN are a much better example of what socialism is or the Greek anarchists.
5019 2018-01-27 19:49:07 Well,  in Nigeria it's our water, let's put away the literal word "like".. 

Until we generate at least 21 hours light,  countries like Nigeria will forever be a worshiper at the temple of crude oil when other countries have moved past that..
5020 2018-01-27 19:49:03 People love the screens. Shifting transportation to cleaner fuels should help, but oil's not going away until projection tech improves.

5025 2018-01-27 19:48:11 it depends on what causes the redness. if it’s from acne rosacea then yes it can reduce redness, just use yogurt instead of milk. if it’s from dry skin use a lot of honey and even some vitamin E oil and make sure to moisturize after!
5026 2018-01-27 19:48:06 I forgot to note: I also use a lot of aloe, coconut oil, and olive oil. I am one slippery mofo.
5027 2018-01-27 19:47:38 I need beard oil ...
5028 2018-01-27 19:47:29 Yes it's so important 
5029 2018-01-27 19:47:12 I actually really like my Prius. Other than regular oil and tire changes, it’s fairly maintenance free. But when something does need replaced...oh boy. No so much the parts but labor is intense
5030 2018-01-27 19:47:04 Hahaha. You're so tough and smart you fell for a slimy snake oil hustler. There's still time to redeem yourself. Find out who he's always been and how he's conned and shafted people like you all his life. Dirty Money - The Confidence Man on Netflix.
5031 2018-01-27 19:47:03 We're not with corporate donors running the party. We're not with fracking, big oil, big pharma, prison industrial complex that uses prisoners as slave labor for corporations. We're not with endless wars. We're not with undemocratic primaries. Can't support that.

5035 2018-01-27 19:46:40 Just seen an ad for oil boilers on eir sport. Didn’t think those things need advertising. Might as well have ads for plungers. Ooh I like the look of that plunger. I’m going out tomorrow and buying a new plunger. Yer birds a plunger. Where’s my boiler. Big plunger. Big boiler.

5038 2018-01-27 19:45:51 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
5039 2018-01-27 19:45:44 The oil and gas people have the advantage of wealth to encourage people to inculcate beliefs which may not stand the test of time. While some of them may be well meaning the risks are not worth the reward. The difficulties will come later when many of them will be long gone.

5043 2018-01-27 19:44:48 I dont give these theories any credence but the logic seems sound to me and I dont see how the existence of a forex market changes that. Iraq prices oil in USD= that much more buyers of USD. If not, fewer buyers. Again, no credence.

5048 2018-01-27 19:44:13 Hmm the article u referenced seems like a catch 22 situation. The indiscriminate fishing & hunting industry provides the funds for restoration of over fished waters & clean up of oil left behind in said waters by motor boats and other vehicles.  Yup catch 22!
5049 2018-01-27 19:44:12 Now maybe forgetting about that pot of fries and oil bubbling away on the stove might have been better. Have the character try to put water on the pot as well.

5062 2018-01-27 19:41:29 Sir next we should target oil seeds. Our strength is agriculture, so why should we import anything from outside. I've heard we directly import edible oil. Double loss.

5074 2018-01-27 19:40:16 I’m not “clinging” to anything. Is it your position that the downturn was not caused by oil dropping nearly $100/barrel in a province that runs on the industry? I listened to an economist describe how the industry smothered growth for other sectors.

5077 2018-01-27 19:40:00 We need it for plastics. Big screen tvs, cell phones, etc. all require oil.
5078 2018-01-27 19:39:46 I definitely agree - IEA objective is to have oil prices as low as possible since they represent oil consuming nations (and they always underestimate oil consumption growth)
5079 2018-01-27 19:39:36 My Olive Oil maybe needs to be tried as well by you to see the excellent taste it adds due to its own fruity flavors
5080 2018-01-27 19:39:23 Because I can't stand long I paint sitting on my bed with the canvas. I knew nothing about oil painting 10 years ago. Basically paintings that depict varying colors and shades of colors are very popular, I'll try to find example. Canvases come in all sizes and are affordable.
5081 2018-01-27 19:39:22 Ahhhh! Like your brain is leaking oil. Better fix up.
5082 2018-01-27 19:39:16 Let's not forget about the 3 million that didn't fall for the snake oil salesman
5083 2018-01-27 19:39:04 & it went with the narrative that we need alternative energy so it makes more sense putting other pieces together. We have regulations going against using gas/oil. Just a big tug of war between two conglomerates, tbh
5084 2018-01-27 19:39:04 Chavez’s spending on the oil revenue is what held us off until we simply stopped taking care of the oil industry. Today we can’t administer nor process our own oil.

Chavez also expropriated 90% of the private sector putting it all under the public domain which is why were fucked

5105 2018-01-27 19:36:38 Yeah, this is was before their economy turned to shit, and Fox News was eager to explain that Venezuela is still capitalist. 

Chavez spent a lot of the oil revenue on subsidies rather than investing in
the country... that's probably one of the reasons the economy is pretty shit.

5109 2018-01-27 19:36:24 Does anyone know how to pan-fry mushrooms? My BF wants fried mushrooms on his burger but I've never done so before, as I think mushrooms are the devil's bellends. Slice thinly, put them in a pan of oil, flip regularly, done? Or something more?
5110 2018-01-27 19:36:21 I said before, IEA IS NOT a neutral institution but a political cesspool run by European socialists. Among the three, I tend trust more EIA AND OPEC as long as you note the EIA TEND TO DRUM UP the USA energy independence song by being too bullish on shale oil production.
5111 2018-01-27 19:35:59 Only since the oil money from Abramovic. Sh*t club, no history
5112 2018-01-27 19:35:33 It probably doesn’t even work because he filled it up with vegetable oil.
5113 2018-01-27 19:35:21 
5114 2018-01-27 19:34:44 That is how the Cult Mechanicus was formed. Try blessed oil, incenses and chanting the canticles of spectrometry next time. That does the trick.
5115 2018-01-27 19:34:43 My boyfriend got a scented oil called "Bump & Grind" I told him I didn't like that label. he said "why, because  of R-Kelly" I said yes. he tore the label off. lol
5116 2018-01-27 19:34:34 thc honey oil making my blunts burn longer then they should
5117 2018-01-27 19:34:34 Pancakes. 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 tsp salt, 3 tsp baking powder, 3 eggs, 3 tbsp olive oil, 2 cups milk (or buttermilk if you like em fluffy). Every Saturday morning.
5118 2018-01-27 19:34:27 Of course cutting any and all regulations will result in SM boom. You know what else it has done before? Massive oil spills and caused the Great Recession. He is all about helping rich companies at the expense of the working class.
5119 2018-01-27 19:34:21 Take fish oil capsules
5120 2018-01-27 19:34:09 One club is a sugar daddy club. They cannot not spend because everyone charges them more since they have oil wealth. The other club actually spends based on what it makes. If you had to spend your own money buying a car would you try to shop around or just walk into a showroom?
5121 2018-01-27 19:34:05 Please tell me one of the magic items the party can discover is a Decanter of Endless Cooking Oil?
5122 2018-01-27 19:33:55 Have you tried coconut oil? Wishing you that it gets better soon! 
5123 2018-01-27 19:33:51 lol i make environmental reports for at the engineering company and every gas station etc. guaranteed will have an oil spill & almost 100% are left there for decades because theres no funding to clean it up LOL (unless its by drinking water or something like that)

5127 2018-01-27 19:33:28 The capitalists deceive us into believing that they have rights to land, oil and other concessions.
5128 2018-01-27 19:33:23 Why would you think this is the start of a bull market? 7years?  Oil up. Commodities rising, wages rising, not enough trained people for the jobs needed, the fed about to raise interest rates (Bigly) what could go wrong
5129 2018-01-27 19:33:18 Oil change new tires #vehiclelove #bills&automobiles lmao
5130 2018-01-27 19:33:16 Another swat to that ass before Jack got into position behind the other man. Lining up and rubbing the tip against the hole to get it slick with oil before pushing in.

5133 2018-01-27 19:32:38 When Nic gets movie snacks to go get an oil change
5134 2018-01-27 19:32:24 Unfortunately this resource (Oil) is being savagely stolen in the large amounts in Nigeria @MaritimeForum_
5135 2018-01-27 19:32:21 Inga's trying to start a rumor that I put Chanel no.5 in my essential oil diffuser
5136 2018-01-27 19:32:17 Fresh mackerel and asparagus. All you need is some salt and pepper for the fish. No olive oil needed.  #bomb
5137 2018-01-27 19:32:16 I wanna do a hot oil treatment but I’ve never done one for locs and it’s going to be a mess
5138 2018-01-27 19:31:42 Yeah I found that real  virgin olive oil or coconut oil works better than the popcorn smelling stuff they sell in hair stores  also aloe from the health store A1
5139 2018-01-27 19:30:50 I don’t know where this oil rally will peak but I know how it ends. Lower prices and more years of pain.
5140 2018-01-27 19:30:33 Oil pastel gumball machines in kids art class today !
5141 2018-01-27 19:30:29 And these two sectors contribute a whole lot to Nigeria's revenue, with Oil and Gas being the major resource and Maritime playing a major

5144 2018-01-27 19:29:30 You know all that oil is heading toward Hawaii after it hits Japan, right?  What a coincidence.  Didn't someone say they hated islands recently?
5145 2018-01-27 19:29:24 Having said above, I may say the oil price might fall somewhat from here, so it all comes down to how much you know about how this magic black gold oil business works, it will take lots of studies, though I personally love the study of oil .
5146 2018-01-27 19:29:16 I've been using castor oil to oil my scalp after washes because coconut oil clogs my pores
5147 2018-01-27 19:29:12 This reminds me, lemme go put my EBO oil on now
5148 2018-01-27 19:29:03 Climate Change denial also enforces a dependence on Russian imports of coal and crude oil as do draconian taxes on clean energy imports such as solar panels and energy efficient appliances.
5149 2018-01-27 19:29:01 Let your words pour the oil of joy upon troubled hearts, giving health, healing, and blessedness
5150 2018-01-27 19:28:53 ORS Monoi Oil leave in. It has the perfect slippery texture and leaves your hair moist asf. CANTU IS CANCELLED.
5151 2018-01-27 19:28:53 Wondering if hotels have rules against checking and possibly replacing brake pads on the van in the car park. It's not like I'm doing an oil change and getting fluids everywhere.
5152 2018-01-27 19:28:42 @Buhari PTF $2.8b is still as fresh as Tomato Jos! No certificate is corruption, Nepotism is corruption, $26b NNPC(Baru as agent) is corruption, N3trilion worth of oil illegally lifted by ghost companies in last 1yr...under @MBuhari

5155 2018-01-27 19:28:31 do you have coconut oil?
5156 2018-01-27 19:28:23 Bright side: less oil to cause global warming #silverlining
5157 2018-01-27 19:27:49 I really wish y’all would agree to wrestle it out in a hot oil pit because this is getting tedious. Gated communities are only important in Cali or Jersey like living in a building with a doorman in only important in NYC. It doesn’t have any meaning for others.
5158 2018-01-27 19:27:40  fracKING actually I went to an oil and drilling camp this break and upstream shit is pretty interesting LOL made me wanna be a PETE
5159 2018-01-27 19:27:27 Wife (treehugger, very into recycling) how come there are lakes at so many racetracks?
Me: So the team's can dump used oil, gas and tyres after the race.
#raceseason #Daytona24 #goAlonso
5160 2018-01-27 19:27:26 So apparently, The Oil and Gas and Maritime Sector happen to be one of the largest sectors in Nigeria
5161 2018-01-27 19:27:17 Lil Baby got cradle cap. Soaked her head in coconut oil and now we both out here smelling like piña coladas lol
5162 2018-01-27 19:27:06 My candid opinion is for the govt to use this boom from the rise of oil price to sort out most of the abandoned infrastructures.I believe taking that step will give the govt a face lift.
Security is also paramount to tackle squarely.Most especially the herdsman debacle.
5163 2018-01-27 19:27:05 I got a lot of coconut oil on my hair. Hopefully it helps with the dry hair! D:
5164 2018-01-27 19:26:52 Indeed Allahﷻ mentioned the Olive tree as being blessed; "a blessed Tree, an Olive, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil is well-nigh luminous.." 
Surat 24: 35 
5165 2018-01-27 19:26:47 Might have to keep my passport on me to buy detergent just cause some oil pump fans want to gain some insta followers and I'm mf #tide
5166 2018-01-27 19:26:45 There’s multitudes of variations to this, but if there’s a rule that you might mix flavours by cooking in the same oil, then I’d feel safe to assume that anything vegan cooked with non-vegan foods would follow the same theory
5167 2018-01-27 19:26:40 You looked amazing at OIL last night- your dress was 
5168 2018-01-27 19:26:38 fans behave like kids nowadays. what can u do??? Unless u have oil money building a team takes time. Jose has not only made us stronger but also giving youth a chance regularly. Honestly style is also better than moyes/lvg. only problem too defensive against top 6.
5169 2018-01-27 19:26:36 Hey Trump, we need you to lift tariffs off solar power for we the people so we won't have to buy your oil all the time you stingy old # koot# !!
5170 2018-01-27 19:26:28 So at night before i sleep i moisturize my face w extra virgin olive oil (straight outa Palestine too, does wonders الحمد لله ما شاء الله). Anyways sometimes i accidentally get some on my lips and i realized everytime tht happens i wake up w hella nice/soft lips
5171 2018-01-27 19:26:13 Cornbread, southern style: use any  recipe, BUT, add oil to pan, place pan in preheated oven and heat oil to oven temp...THEN, add cornbread batter and bake.  The crispy edges are to die for.
5172 2018-01-27 19:26:11 Very true, we all let us drag into war by fucking countries hungry for oil and sick need for world domination while they live in peace at home.....fuck h'm all
5173 2018-01-27 19:26:10 Also... so (((they))) can have access to the some of the largest oil, gas and mineral deposits in the world.
5174 2018-01-27 19:26:03 bn Umar recorded the well-known hadith "use olive oil and anoint yourself with it, because it is 'from a blessed tree'"24:35 [al-Bayhaqi] #zitzaytun
5175 2018-01-27 19:25:33 The oil and gas industry began to shudder in 2014. No previous gov’t has ever been able to stop the bust cycle and no future gov’t will either. All the gov’t did was maintain spending during the fall. Now they’re beginning to cut.
5176 2018-01-27 19:25:30 Sucking up to oil money
5177 2018-01-27 19:25:29 A generation that failed to:
1. Diversify Govt revenues away from crude oil
2. Solve the Niger Delta question
3. Solve poverty in the NE that bred Boko Haram
4. Reform the Nigerian Police
5. Provide steady electricity and potable water

Says "youths are not ready for governance"
5178 2018-01-27 19:25:28 Both will prove to be wrong, IMO
5179 2018-01-27 19:25:26 Never mentioned being a fan who doesn’t live in Manchester is wrong, but I’m not a Jonny come lately fan, I’ve witnessed hard and dark times, we are enjoying it now. We’ve done a lot not just on the pitch but in the community, all that gets said is oil money! Fans are fans

5182 2018-01-27 19:24:44 Technically speaking if you’re cooking vegetables in the same oil you’ve cooked meat, or bread with egg, then the vegetables will absorb whatever has been cooked in the oil; this is also why you shouldn’t use oil that fish has been cooked in because your food will taste fishy 
5183 2018-01-27 19:24:43 That serum oil from @MLCosmetic  been clearing up this nasty rash I had on foot . I'm shocked.  Cause nothing else worked for it
5184 2018-01-27 19:24:41 Should I call someone? 

I really think there's an attack coming based on putting a few pieces together. 

1) ALL of Trump team in Davos 
2) Oil Spill.
3) Obstruction Basically Proven 
4) Who profits from the spill?

I'm a naturally paranoid person, so I may be tripping out.
5185 2018-01-27 19:24:40 i drink cola from the oil pump
5186 2018-01-27 19:24:28 truthfully, just try to drink enough water and maybe a smoothie if you can and rest. fish oil, vitamin b, c, & d, and netflix.
5187 2018-01-27 19:24:26 I'm talking life skills - filing taxes, how to change tires, check oil, do laundry, iron clothes for interviews, etc. There are a LOT of adulting skills that aren't covered.
5188 2018-01-27 19:24:25 The curse that is oil.
5189 2018-01-27 19:24:17 Your tax dollars are used for solar, wind technology R&D, not oil and gas.  Oil and gas provides jobs, huge revenue in tax dollars and produce energy that keeps you alive and millions of others each day.  You should embrace it.
5190 2018-01-27 19:23:46 i tried to save my dry af hair with coconut oil and i put too much so now my hair looks greasy 
5191 2018-01-27 19:23:43 Respectfully disagree. Gold/USD and Oil/USD increasingly correlated thanks to China.
5192 2018-01-27 19:23:43 And Lindsey whatsername. Or, bring in some real diversity with Sheila Gunn Reid - let the oil patch arm candy finally get some recognition. White Catholics have been silenced for too long!
5193 2018-01-27 19:23:40 Wasn't that Kennedy idiot the one that loves Venezuelan oil so much?
5194 2018-01-27 19:23:31 my skin is so dry that even coconut oil isn't .. oily enough
5195 2018-01-27 19:23:29 Pian kpop tu keje kt oil rig kalau tk silap. Mmg masyuk ahh citer dia walaupun position bawah bawah
5196 2018-01-27 19:23:27 Currently sitting here feeling like a piece of shit as I pay someone to change my oil for me...
5197 2018-01-27 19:23:19 Norway has far lower extraction costs for oil, and also has state-owned oil companies, hence the higher tax revenues. It also has debt, despite its oil fund, caused by high borrowing.

5200 2018-01-27 19:22:49 Hi All, this Trumper followed everyone on the list.  Please add me to the next list!!!  Thanks.
5201 2018-01-27 19:22:30 Also why waste a condom to 'lube' a ring off your finger? Soap, cooking oil, or spit, would do!
5202 2018-01-27 19:22:22 Coconut oil is working miracles on my hair and skin. God bless.
5203 2018-01-27 19:22:14 How much electricity is produced with crude oil? Or refined crude oil?
5204 2018-01-27 19:21:48 the maritime sector aids the entire crude oil process
5205 2018-01-27 19:21:48 OIL was a crazy ass party, good shit. 
Got to meet @ladominahelena @theNatalieMars @GoddessTangent and @GothCharlotte and they were all super nice

5207 2018-01-27 19:21:31 Wonder if being agile coach actually pays well? Seems like snake oil salesman job, but hey if it pays ...

5209 2018-01-27 19:21:15 "post-colonialism"  was but a brief moment in our history the advent of oil brought about"Neo-colonialism" which we're yet to fully comprehend because our leaders are collaborators
5210 2018-01-27 19:21:02 You know that without the inclusion of Socialist Countries (predominantly China) global poverty is increasing?
Venezuela's acchievments in reducing poverty prior to the collapse in oil prices is remarkable. What world are you living on.
5211 2018-01-27 19:20:51 Day off was great aside from changing my oil, cleaning the house, fixing a broken closet and running dogs out. I played Friday the 13th way too long!
5212 2018-01-27 19:20:49 Midnight Oil is a magical place. You can have a seat, working wifi, or an outlet, but if you have all three at the same time you disrupt the order of the universe and are transported to the chaos dimension.
5213 2018-01-27 19:20:48 I went in for an oil change, end up needing 2 tires. Anybody wanna buy some crochet items 
5214 2018-01-27 19:20:38 Just what the oil industry is paying Trump for
5215 2018-01-27 19:20:30 well 1) they never have anything and 2) the oil always stale
5216 2018-01-27 19:20:27 Girl Smoke 2 backwoods a day and drinkin henny and cola all night. Yo coochi taste like motor oil.
5217 2018-01-27 19:20:25 Not sure if I'm sold on #teatree oil. 
Diffusing it now. Reminds me of a moldy basement.
AM I CRAZY? @younglivingES
5218 2018-01-27 19:20:17 I turn on some soothing music bc self care + I then go into moisturizing my skin. I use a lil bio oil while my skin is still wet. Then I use this vitamin c serum bc im tryna glow like Kelis. I like to wait at least 60 seconds before applying each product then I finish with a spf
5219 2018-01-27 19:20:12 One of the weirdest conspiracy theories I see on all sides of the political spectrum is "the US overthrew X because they were going to stop pricing oil in dollars!", and I don't know why it's so popular.  Do people not know there's a forex market?
5220 2018-01-27 19:20:09 Hope they've thawed out! Cod liver oil.
5221 2018-01-27 19:20:05 Getting my oil changed and this 40 year old employee just gave me thee weirdest smile 
5222 2018-01-27 19:20:03 Oil change .
Can’t believe I paid people to do that
5223 2018-01-27 19:19:38 Norway made huge tax revenue from oil while producing less than Scotland...problem with Scotland/UK oil and gas sector is the ludicrous deals made by Westminster
5224 2018-01-27 19:19:36 I won $1700.00 playing with this Oil... #OWNIT... Limited to a few Bottles. Each One was empowered by Wealth Mantras and Obstacle Removal...
5225 2018-01-27 19:19:36 Jamaican castor oil is really some real truth. 
5226 2018-01-27 19:19:31 Everytime I get out the shower and coat myself in coconut oil, I feel so luxurious
5227 2018-01-27 19:19:23 Crab and callaloo if my social studies memory serves me correctly. Oil down is GRENADIAN

5231 2018-01-27 19:19:09 With oil smears on
5232 2018-01-27 19:18:57 It makes a mockery of any financial figures that emanate from WM as they do not include Oil & Gas. No doubt Douglas Fraser at the BBC will be out to spread some doom and gloom.
5233 2018-01-27 19:18:56 It's sad when the first think you think is: "Hopefully, it's JUST the Worst Oil Spill in Recent History."
5234 2018-01-27 19:18:56 Buffalo wings from rock oil are life 
5235 2018-01-27 19:18:35 Perfect example of how clueless tRump is about how he acts and what reality really is.  He is a pathological liar... Living in his little bubble of lies and fake truths... He is a SNAKE OIL SALESMAN... and not even a good one at that. DUMP TRUMP 2020..
5236 2018-01-27 19:18:33 Mess? What about all the mess created by turkey letting isis move illegal oil by the truckload thru it?
5237 2018-01-27 19:18:29 Maybe people should focus on the inhumane and disgusting way the chickens are kept, and slaughtered, then dunked in oil deep fried to contribute people getting fat, heart disease etc. Rather than who is slinging the pitch in the commercial?
Just saying... that's all.
5238 2018-01-27 19:18:22 Amen. And we havent even started to reconcile how to deal w oil, natural gas, or industry. Lots of very difficult choices staring us in the face.
5239 2018-01-27 19:18:21 The #EU never cut ties with its colonialist behaviour/networks, they never helped #Tunisia during the crisis of 1978- 1983- 2008- 2011, etc. they are part of the problem and cannot be part of the solution. By the way I am not sure that there is no Oil/Gaz in Tunisia.

5246 2018-01-27 19:17:00 Clinton Global Initiative and their mining efforts, rare earth minerals,uranium one, diamonds, oil, gas.... UN would be perfect color of law to hide their 3rd World Global Plundering. Truly a world wide RICO crime syndicate.

5249 2018-01-27 19:16:45 Shout-out to me for bringing a buffet from Whole Foods to eat while I wait for an oil change at the dealership.
5250 2018-01-27 19:16:44 Changing the oil on our cars in the garage before #UFCCharlotte kicks off. Will be off-line for about 45 mins & check in to see if we have any last minute scratches. Almost game time.
5251 2018-01-27 19:16:38 That's unknown until we know how much oil really leaves rigs without paying any tax, full renewables potential is known etc
5252 2018-01-27 19:16:37 And that they are in bed with Big Oil and Coal. They are fossils...
5253 2018-01-27 19:16:36 It's nice to hear from someone who advocates for financial opportunities for First Nations people instead of throwing up roadblocks to every development proposal out there. And trust me, the liberal government in Ottawa is not your friend. They do not support oil sands pipelines.

5255 2018-01-27 19:16:27 Dude it is fire, but it’s A LOT of oil. I can’t eat it now after making it.
5256 2018-01-27 19:16:14 Hope the oil spill isn't a precursor to an Attack.  That's how it would happen.  An "Accidental" oil spill in the right place to ignite.  Simultaneously choking off Japan's Reef and Ocean income, while also providing a flaming barricade to impede their Naval movement.

OH SHIT
5257 2018-01-27 19:16:10 Someone who was crooked., Next thing they had 2 new naturalized citizen  crooks to sell off UKr assets Gold Uranium oil drugs Russian gas (steal) ... My son got great job..
5258 2018-01-27 19:16:02 That Forbes list is always false. They just say whatever they like. Aside from this, I concur that Nigeria should leave oil alone.
5259 2018-01-27 19:15:47 These fools put the wrong oil in my car and now my shit fuckin up
5260 2018-01-27 19:15:47 Just made a particularly "extra" version of a ham and cheese sandwich. Grilled it in a waffle iron, sprinkled in olive oil, and added avocado ranch dressing. It was delicious! #JessesCulinaryAdventures
5261 2018-01-27 19:15:34 then after my eye exam ima go to this phone company to suspend this 2nd line and change my number then get my oil changed & wash my car 
5262 2018-01-27 19:15:30 I would never go back to Walmart again to get my oil changed
5263 2018-01-27 19:15:15 The curve will morph from backwardation to contango and the front month or spot price of oil will have a massive decline. Sometimes it happens overnight.
5264 2018-01-27 19:15:14 I need an oil change

5272 2018-01-27 19:14:09 So my uncle is telling me stories of his youth and this dudes telling me to get a quick tan mix baby oil and iodine.... that’s way this dude got cancer I swear
5273 2018-01-27 19:13:59 Y’all lmao. I went to get my first oil change on my car.. they gave me the total and I cried “this car is gonna bankrupt me ” with the tiniest tear in my eye.. “can I just work here to pay it off ?” He gave me $50 off  no, I’m not proud but I’m happy 
5274 2018-01-27 19:13:54 Happy days! I'll visit and expect neat beards heavy on the oil, skin tight trousers and brogues with no socks.
5275 2018-01-27 19:13:41 The long end of the oil curve is declining. Look at 18 months out. the hedging value to EPs diminish and they decline first (they are selling oil for less 18months from now, less profit, stock price declines.

5289 2018-01-27 19:11:59 Usually whatever I make starts with caramelizing onions in olive oil with salt and pepper. You can add whatever vegetables and protein you want once the onions have browned and it’ll be delicious
5290 2018-01-27 19:11:48 Shakshuka of any kind. Olive oil, throw garlic in, then some diced tomatoes. Wait a few minutes, add onions + 1 tbsp tomato paste to thicken. Clear a space + crack an egg in about 5 minutes later, add spices to taste. Cover until egg is cooked to taste. Eat with baguette.
5291 2018-01-27 19:11:39 I’m talking about the fact that you’re writing about an issue that you have a personal interest in as a former trustee. 

Not sure if you have plans on returning to politics, but when oil executives write columns about oil, I expect them to be identified as such, that’s all.
5292 2018-01-27 19:11:34 THC oil is pretty effective.

5300 2018-01-27 19:10:35 Oh coconut oil is not enough. I use a coco/blackseed/almond mix at night for hydration. Use this straight out the shower. In the morning. I take biotin, omega-3, and Iron with B-complex vitamins. This is for the inner glow goddess. Down that with some room temp water and lemon.

5305 2018-01-27 19:09:48 I'm not going to lie to you when I first heard the news the last thing I thought of was the Oil trying to distract ppl from that trade. Believe me If Hall lights it up In Sweden the fans won't forget about the trade.

5309 2018-01-27 19:09:29 Well, many methods. 

1. PPP financing. 
2. Cutting down on our bloated civil service and legislators pay, by pursuing reforms and using tech. 
3. Relinguishing this "olowo" mentality and removing subsidy.
4. Ending Hajj and pilgrimage funding.
5. Update or Oil taxes laws.
5310 2018-01-27 19:09:24 GREAT job! I LOVE playing with chalk pastels myself. So much versatility, like oil paint but dry.

5321 2018-01-27 19:07:46 But why does it matter who they voted for? What does that have to do with how they teach? If it's not relevant to the subject matter why should it be asked? Next you'll tell me my mechanic is a mino because somehow small government dictates how he should change my oil?

5323 2018-01-27 19:07:19 Yup. Comcast raised its prices too. As did Netflix, but that’s probably more to do with the end of net neutrality. Guess that was a win too... Did I mention solar companies putting expansion in the US on hold due to tariffs. They employ more ppl than oil and gas COMBINED.
5324 2018-01-27 19:07:17 Coal barons and oil companies above all! Never mind environmental disasters and health hazards! It's money and profits that count. Vote them all out and carefully vet those who want to take their place!
5325 2018-01-27 19:07:14 We all know that the Oil and Gas in Nigeria is very crucial for development and day to day living.

5327 2018-01-27 19:07:02  what are you working with? I took a makeup break and have been using coconut oil only but I want more!
5328 2018-01-27 19:06:55 @gregsny the same OBJ that meant 0 in your reserve and oil selling at $20-25 paid up your nations debt from independence, left $60b reserve, stock at N14tr, increased minimum wage, consolidated ur banks, stabilized your currency, put that mobil phone in your hands etc
5329 2018-01-27 19:06:47 Just found out about Marula Oil cause it's in the hand soap I got and it leaves my hands moisturizerd, I need to find it for my face and skin ASAP
5330 2018-01-27 19:06:45 Right, I really blew my carbs out yesterday by mistake. Woke up feeling pretty groggy as well. Time to get that number a bit more under control today if pantry allows, which is actually unlikely without guzzling coconut oil again.
5331 2018-01-27 19:06:42 It’s easy to forget about this with all the focus currently on Broadford Bridge ... regardless of flow results at B.B. .. #UKOG still have “nationally significant levels ” of oil to extract ... #VIVA UKOG !

5334 2018-01-27 19:06:27 i need to hurry up & get off so i can go & get me 2 large pizzas  & some oil for my cake

5339 2018-01-27 19:05:50 if fries and/or tortilla chips are fried in vegan oil but are fried in the same oil as non-vegan items..
so there’s a chance of cross-contamination.

do you still consider them vegan?
5340 2018-01-27 19:05:42 Riq brings the whole frying pan to me just to ask  “Is this enough oil?” 
5341 2018-01-27 19:05:33 Oil down of all things. I don't even eat that 
5342 2018-01-27 19:05:27 We all have that one pot of oil next to our cookers 
5343 2018-01-27 19:05:22 Hey guys its time for our session on maritime and illegal oil trade with @TheOilandGasBar..retweet as you come online
5344 2018-01-27 19:05:11 Which Trinis claiming oil down? What wrong with these people 
5345 2018-01-27 19:04:49 Most people have oil/gas in their pension pots even if the funds are supposedly green ... yours too!
5346 2018-01-27 19:04:47 Oil and gas are one of the few assets left to borrow against - the more they admit there is, the more they can borrow.
5347 2018-01-27 19:04:42 We had a new one on a 4 post lift at a trade show in Frankfurt in '96.... yep, dripped oil on the stand's carpet, and on someone's head 
5348 2018-01-27 19:04:35 why did the hippies have to go and ruin patchouli oil

5351 2018-01-27 19:04:03 We need drill for oil off of Barrow Alaska.
5352 2018-01-27 19:03:58 I'm not even sure how bad it is. I haven't had this volume of "product" in my hair in my whole life. I just sort of comically let the guy do what he wanted with all his gels and sprays and creams and mists and pesto sauce. I'll see how it looks once this oil slick is washed out.
5353 2018-01-27 19:03:55 You need to do do more research. Even including oil scotland received a £9 billion fiscal transfer last year. Should we give rofuk it back?
5354 2018-01-27 19:03:54 It really depends on your skin type. People with oily skin don’t need to wash with more oil. Also you only need one cleanser unless you wear heavy makeup. A lot of this is just a push to sell more product (yes I realize this is a sponsored tweet)

5360 2018-01-27 19:02:52 Inflation, by definition, is more units of money used in the same number of transactions. Neither higher oil prices or a falling forex rate creates more units of money so the headline is wrong. Want another try?
5361 2018-01-27 19:02:30 Last I checked there's more Caribbean people with passports than not  do you travel sis?

Why are trinis so adamant on claiming oil down is what I REALLY want to know  this is all too... Strange. How you gonna tell a Grenadian what oil down is supposed to look like??

5387 2018-01-27 18:59:46 Insist on the word sir. The budget ballooned in tandem with the astronomical oil price rise of 2011 - 2014. I witnessed several capital projects that were spuriously commissioned and lacked real economic impact. My alma mater (FGCL ijanikin) but 2 fully equipped resource centers

5391 2018-01-27 18:58:55 It was lovely M&M Oil Corp. of Deer Park NY who paid this guy with a suspended licence drive its big truck. Not to say City isn't also responsible:  absurdly, it worries more about restaurants that use bike delivery.

5408 2018-01-27 18:56:32 Honestly I may just not use the 2 remaining free oil changes since @BochToyotaSouth takes forever and "like an hour" turned into an hour and half real quick. People who came in after us were finished quicker.

5438 2018-01-27 18:52:35 Been listening to your broadcast. One question: why are you not rooting for men toiling in mines and oil&gas? I'm sure they'd love to swap jobs with these girls and have a pecuniary benefit for walking down the podium, but they don't have a choice.
5439 2018-01-27 18:52:34 Who should invest in FZIL? Investors who are seeking more direct, tax free exposure to oil and gas in Nigeria.

BP is also accused of large-scale UK tax avoidance.

5462 2018-01-27 18:49:59 The sooner we realize that Nigeria is a business and not a country, the better for us. A business owned by political elites, with the active support of the Armed forces to protect its investment (oil). The owners don't care about you, they only care about their interests.
5463 2018-01-27 18:49:57 Sure. I was caught with .02g of marijuana oil residue in a vape pen in Utah. That cost me a criminal record, cuffs, 6 hrs in holding, bail of $1,200, and monthly fine payments of $100 for 12 months, during which any further police encounter w/weed would mean my 1yr imprisonment.

5478 2018-01-27 18:48:39 Lol. Of course. But predictive economics is different than a flat earth. It’s just foolish to think that oil is the future. Whatever is to be gained in trade will be lost by what we stand to lose in technology.
5479 2018-01-27 18:48:28 They are governing just fine, idiot.  They lowered taxes, removed hurtful regulations, approved the pipeline, opened up part of Alaska for drilling so we can get oil independent, approved lots of good judges and much more.  Where have you been?

5482 2018-01-27 18:48:04 So this means more tax breaks for the oil companies does it? Rewarding them for laying off thousands and thousands of workers. Aye, of course it does, cause MPs, Donors and Lords receive huge dividends.

5484 2018-01-27 18:47:51 I get it. I used to think Texas was big shit back in the day

5487 2018-01-27 18:47:36 No they didn't. They knew perfectly well how much oil there was. That is why they lied to the Scottish people about it in 2014. They won't be able to lie about it next time. Never ever trust a tory.

5507 2018-01-27 18:44:50 John Williamson has it all wrong. Higher gas prices in Canada will accelerate the move to electric cars and reduce our dependence on oil.  The u.s., on the other hand, will be like Mexico, which is still using Diesel and suffers from excessive pollution.

5510 2018-01-27 18:44:25 lets see what happens. point is: twitter can be taken over by any of these advertising/sales giants any time. they all have clients in the oil & gas industry and therefore a direct conflict of interest with anti-#fracking activism.

5512 2018-01-27 18:44:18 I think you underestimate their avoidance of attempts at deeper decolonization.

I think they are building Tx where it facilitates oil/gas industry.
I think they abandoned more efficient new-build gas for far dirtier, but cheap retrofits of old coal units.
5513 2018-01-27 18:44:16 plain is fine! if u want to get fancy u can add like a teaspoon of olive oil which is great for skin as well.

5518 2018-01-27 18:43:23 Why should tax payers continue to prop up Big Oil’s R&D when BO continues to post record breaking profits?

Cite your source about solar & wind. I doubt they have been subsidized as heavily, & as long, as BO has.

5576 2018-01-27 18:37:31 Discussion was on migration but ok. Scotland still has oil that has been squandered by Westminster tax breaks that will cover large part of any shortfall. Add to that renewables potential of wind, tidal and wave. Scotland will be fine & finally democratic. See mcrone report

5605 2018-01-27 18:33:08 Have you been doing this for 2 weeks or 2 years?  Tulip bubble, tech bubble, real estate bubble, oil bubble, 09 was an upside down bubble, bitcoin.  They start with fundamentals reasons but end up massively overpriced driven by momentum & human behavior.
5606 2018-01-27 18:32:55 Uneducated people believe what the oil companies tell them.
5607 2018-01-27 18:32:49 I remember when tori and i tried to eat a wholesome salad but without any knowledge the croutons had weed oil residue and had us so fried. Long story short, I can’t eat croutons anymore.
5608 2018-01-27 18:32:48 I'm sure cannabis oils in coconut oil would have been way way safer than steroids. Not sure why people think these crazy man-made pharmaceutical drugs are ok but God's pharmacy is bad? Wishing good health to all who suffer that condition. It looks like literal hell.
5609 2018-01-27 18:32:42 It's just regular ice that you thought was clear road... until ooops.
Calling it black ice gives it some sinister property as if it's moxes with oil or something to make it extra slippery.

5625 2018-01-27 18:30:21 Absolutely, and if the west wasn't sill so reliant on oil, I'm pretty confident we wouldn't be selling squat to them.  Its really all about money,  and which money controls the governments.  The majority of the people are just bystanders or consumers of the various distractions.

5632 2018-01-27 18:29:20 US oil and gas production have saved each US consumer an estimated 1400/year in gasoline and natural gas prices (about 700 for each fuel).

That was the free market that did that, in spite of Barry's insistence it was him.

5638 2018-01-27 18:28:31 There’s many reasons that oil prices will reach 83
1- global demand has a strong 
2-  supply’s oil of Venezuela and Lybia decreases 
3- oil demand >oil supply by 1 million or more 
4- OPEC deal 
5- technically : oil prices up to 83
6- global growth is strong

5680 2018-01-27 18:23:25 I believe that is exactly what he is doing. He represents the oil industry who’ only concern is to make money until the last drop of oil & oil products cease to exist. So of course they are attacking clean & renewable energy.
5681 2018-01-27 18:23:10 End the oil subsidies first!  New businesses need help starting out, not established ones that are already profitable by the billions.

#veganboyintrainingbutnotreally
5725 2018-01-27 18:18:11 The answer lies in our food supply people. Don't eat anything but NonGmo certified organic and lots of good fats like olive oil, avacado, grass fed butter and whole milk. Forget the brain shrinking sugar free fat free garbage and cook your own food not processed.

5728 2018-01-27 18:17:44 The US controls the price of oil now. At least the upside. US production keeps the prices low. Natural gas is great example. $12+/mscf in 2008, and now it trades in a very narrow range near 3. 

US oil production is doing the same thing to global oil prices. Limits upside.

5748 2018-01-27 18:14:58 No. No one values random bits of paper.

Money is a concrete token of value, and value is trust.

What one does not trust, one does not value.

Other than that, your reasoning is circular, and muddy. 

The oil is used to power many undertakings, for good and ill.

But under Trump, who has NEVER said one word again Russia, is intending to cash in on the gas & oil deals.

5791 2018-01-27 18:10:43 Diversification under this administration is applaudable. We must have to sustain and continue in it. We can not as a nation, have one GDP as crude oil. We must learn to suffer a while to become real productive and not depending on foreign aids.

5815 2018-01-27 18:07:09 I get that. Though it's rarely recommended to meditate when there's trouble. It's a practice. I've seen it compared to changing the oil in a car. If you only wait til there's trouble, you're causing damage. That's why the purpose of it is the thing itself.
5816 2018-01-27 18:07:06 Convinced my healthy husband to have a chocolate chip cookie from Panera at lunch, but when we looked at the ingredients (after), it contains hydrogenated palm oil. No popcorn for me at movie night tonight! #oops
5817 2018-01-27 18:07:03 This is the exact reason why Oil is shipped to China. They produce plastic BS & ship it back to USA. Petrocurrency in action.
5818 2018-01-27 18:07:01 So mixing the coconut oil with hot water in a can to splash it on my hair was the the best idea ever.
5819 2018-01-27 18:06:36 A trick is to allow hot water to sit on the oily part and when enough time has passed you can start scrubbing. I use my hand to rub off the oil before scrubbing
5820 2018-01-27 18:06:28 Two chopped, trimmed chicken breasts. Two tablespoons Tony Chechere's Creole seasoning. One teaspoon yellow curry powder. Carefully spread it across all pieces of chicken. In a frying pan with olive oil, place chicken in pan and cook until very lightly browned on both sides. OMG!
5821 2018-01-27 18:06:17 You could try coconut oil instead. I'm allergic to Vicks, so I can't use it anyways. But I use coconut oil, and it never burns me. Carmex also works well, but that one might burn too. Hope you feel better. :)

5824 2018-01-27 18:05:38 I agree hardly anyone understands this nor does Trudeau when he sighted that oil was at $95/barrel when pipeline was proposed?? Makes no sense would rather buy Saudi oil at world price
5825 2018-01-27 18:05:35 Like bitch I only wanted an oil change done left with a whole brand new car 
5826 2018-01-27 18:05:27 I just think that over time, as other countries invest in more climate friendly technology/fuel, their need for our oil will plummet, by design they already want the dollar weaker, and we are going to be so far behind the ball that we’ll get crushed in trade.
5827 2018-01-27 18:05:26 Scam artist snake oil salesman! Who the hell books these people?

5834 2018-01-27 18:04:08 You're completely wrong. The reason the dollar has been stable and basically unchanging for 30 yrs is based on oil based currency. The dollar can't change or oil prices wouldn't make sense. Most of the worlds economy is based on the dollar. It's the variable base.

5840 2018-01-27 18:03:26 Bro the west likes to seem very righteous but let’s be realistic and in the words of Donald trump “there is nothing wrong with one country taking advantage of another for its own good.”  The West has killed far too many for oil and riches.

5852 2018-01-27 18:02:23 I think the problem is that so much of our interests have been in oil thanks to Harper that the business community is too invested to want to change. But we'd better get on it. I fear the time when we all change to electric cars (coming quickly). I don't think we'll be ready.

The North Slope has enough oil to power the United States for 200+ years.

We can export some of this.  This frees so many US allies from the despotic energy Cartels. This is a game-changer.

5866 2018-01-27 18:00:41 This has been on my mind. A (very dry, conceptual) visiting tutor at Winchester School of Art once said (of my 1m sq bold, dark-hued oil landscapes) that I was “a Romantic painter”. I took immediate offense to it & was bothered by it for about 20yrs. He meant in the Caspar David

5875 2018-01-27 18:00:02 @NancyPelosi Has anyone thought about approaching Mexico as to becoming our 51st state? And opening up the massive oil resources and becoming an economic super power like no one has imagined until now. Everyone would be happy and we would have more jobs available than people.
5876 2018-01-27 17:59:55 Neither of those things have anything to do with the NDP. The slow boards are the result of low GLOBAL oil prices. And the losses to non-union spins-offs is the result of double-breasting rules (brought to you by conservatives).
5877 2018-01-27 17:59:52 That dollar value is entirely dependent on these policies effecting the economy. I think long term, oil is dying. We’re not investing in technology to accelerate coal independence, which I think is a mistake.
5878 2018-01-27 17:59:42 Bill Clinton was more of a conservative than the Bush Fam... The dollar did quite well under Clinton. This was the internet boom as well but u can't base everything on booms... Go back and make the dollar non oil based and the economy would have plummeted...

5883 2018-01-27 17:59:23 While I commend govt actions, I must point out that NOT learning from past mistake will be getting comfortable at $45-$46/pbl. We should definitely care about the price of oil and be prepared for when it falls below $45 or even $30/pbl?
5884 2018-01-27 17:59:19 getting your girl nails done was a 2017 wave. fellas y’all got to make sure ya girl oil is changed , car is washed/ detailed , with a full tank of ethanol.

5886 2018-01-27 17:58:58 I think it’s more funds flow and PMs capital allocation to the sector, for now. Why trade out of tech into energy, especially if you know little about the space.

5911 2018-01-27 17:54:42 True. But true also, Turkey provided for years an essential corridor into ISIS territory  for weapons, logistic, fighter R&R / treatment and illegal oil trade over the border to Syrian area controlled by Erdogan Turks, Or was that ISIS ho ji minh path agreed with the US?

5919 2018-01-27 17:53:42 I remember that. Shows how dumb the oil market can be at times. Syria has basically no oil. A missile attack there had nothing to do with supply or demand. Yet it rallied? Also Trump didn't do that for children. He did it to look good for his dumb racist voters.

It should be seen as treason for what both parties have done.
5949 2018-01-27 17:50:17 No, child, oil is only a part of it, a single form of power.

Money is the abstract, fungible, form of power.

It's ironic that money is founded on trust, yet its pursuit destroys trust.

5952 2018-01-27 17:50:08 Good thought but Henry Kissinger this week said US soon oil exporter & oil independent. This great wealth US plans rebuild cities & eliminate poverty plus eliminate debt. All good things.
5953 2018-01-27 17:49:53 Because of this the dollar will stay strong because oil is such a huge commodity...

6106 2018-01-27 17:34:25 Y’all ever take up hobbies when you’re bored and can’t make plans? I just started trying to oil paint. Over the summer it was embroidery, and over Christmas break I actually tried to fucking make pickles (and failed)
6107 2018-01-27 17:34:23 В Oil & Gas journal есть дико провокационная статья о российской политической энергобезопасности, но зато автор использовал Present Perfect/Past Simple просто как боженька. Беру!
6108 2018-01-27 17:34:22 #Kpop2009 ช่วงใจพังที่แท้ทรู เพราะโอปป้าแยกวงกันเยอะ แต่ก็เป็นช่วงที่เป็นติ่งแล้วมีความสุข เสพเพลง เสพโอปป้า ยากไปหน่อยแต่ก็โอเค สมัยติ่งครองเมือง ไม่ใช่ชนชั้นที่2345เหมือนตอนนี้แค่เป็นติ่งก็ผิดแล้ว เฮ้ออ ถึงเราจะวอร์กันใน Siamzone บ่อยๆแต่ก็คิดถึง 55555
6109 2018-01-27 17:34:16 a more efficient way of consuming oil would be for you to leave your gasoline powered car running in the garage constantly. perhaps with the garage door closed to uphold libertarian principles.
6110 2018-01-27 17:34:12 ok if this coconut oil doesn’t help someone help a girl out
used a face mask that burned my skin and currently dry af, irritated to the  max, and left my under eyes and chin area red and super duper dry :( any recommendations?
6111 2018-01-27 17:34:07 Well idk if this will help with the marking, but if he is having any sort of anxiety or is acting really rambunctious, put a little bit of lavender essential oil on each paw, if works so well
6112 2018-01-27 17:34:06 While educating 3rd world women is a noble cause, removing the chains of Islam from those under it should be the first priority! We're committing borrowed $$ to counter Saudi oil wealth $$ imposed ignorance, won't happen!
6113 2018-01-27 17:34:04 I spend a lot of money on high end skin care, but almond oil is truly an unsung hero

6122 2018-01-27 17:33:01 Did you forget about the oil recession?
6123 2018-01-27 17:33:00 There is twice as much oil floating in the oceans and washing up on the beaches from natural seepage as from all offshore platform accidents combined.
6124 2018-01-27 17:32:58 Which should mark the beginning of the end of heavy dependence on fossil fuels (except for aviation and military vehicles perhaps).  Hope by now, countries like Nigeria can see the handwriting on the wall -- Oil business is no longer central.  DIVERSIFY!

6139 2018-01-27 17:31:51 Definitely what needs to happen because it's a colossally bad idea. Coastal states should be more focused on preserving tourism featuring unpolluted water than allowing oil companies to expand offshore drilling.

6214 2018-01-27 17:23:42 Personally I found underdrawing all my shadow shapes really help with likeness but that’s only if I’m doing it in graphite. If I’m oil painting it, I do an outline drawing on the canvas and have a graphite study of facial features and shadow shapes with me. It’s a nice reference.

6249 2018-01-27 17:20:11 Fair enough. Too many of them actually own oil drilling operations, etc tho.
6250 2018-01-27 17:20:09 It’s bizarre that economic downturn caused by a collapse in oil prices caused in part by overproduction world wide is somehow the fault of NDP.  Conserv govts didn’t save $ during $100/ barrel and in spite of rw hyperbole carbon tax is supported generally
6251 2018-01-27 17:20:09 What? You killed The Pipeline ,plus thousands of jobs, that would have Given us access to the Asian market.Instead since we have no access , we sell our Oil to the USA at ex, $30.00bbl. The US then sells the same oil to the Asian market at $63.00Bbl.A better deal??

(2) Unhook from their oil/gas (Putin wants that dependence), so xfer to solar/wind/etc esp in Europe.

6266 2018-01-27 17:18:35 Low base is the reason. Libya's GDP fell in recent years significantly due to the armed conflict. The country has great (partially unexploited) natural resources like oil and is able to achieve a high growth. The main condition is that the war comes finally to an (relative) end.

Even the saudis are installing solar to save oil, so they can export more. Why, cause it costs about $5 in solar to offset a ibarrel of oil. They triple their money on solar.

6403 2018-01-27 17:00:59 had this weird dream last night that my mom put some special ham oil in my applesauce as a kid and made it taste sweeter & tbh i dont like dreaming when taking cold medicine bc then my mind produces these weird things
6404 2018-01-27 17:00:39 โอ้ยยยยยย ยิ่งพูดละยิ่งเจ็บหัวใจ..... มีฟิคให้พี่มั้ยคะะะะะ ฮรุ่กกก
6405 2018-01-27 17:00:37 I don't mean any offense my president but can you listen to yourself? So you are behind the increment in oil so you can use it for infrastructure as per said.
6406 2018-01-27 17:00:27 Becuz this is the age of feelings. If you feel like it's true, then it is. And there is a whole network of enablers ready to support and make money off your feelings (Coulter, Hannity, Limbaugh, Gingrich, big oil, big pharma, etc)

6408 2018-01-27 17:00:23 Wee gonna get killed!! Many of us lived through the 80’s, when the NEP caused two thinks, recession and the mass exodus from Canadian oil, and later the moves of the oil majors to take out Canadian companies. We are going to be screwed!

6414 2018-01-27 17:00:01 The Chump Train riders R way to dumb to understand.  Well Conned Snake oil buyers.  Just wait a few more weeks.  They will see the payoff in their pay checks. Bottom rung went from 5% tax to 10%.  They R so stupid Rump doubled their taxes & they Love it.

6418 2018-01-27 16:59:42 That isn’t true. Rep Alan Grayson (D)FL demanded Cruz’ Mom Show B/Cert. - She was born in Delaware.  They were in  doing oil rig work when Ted was born. Canada stated. Voting Rolls don’t mean you’re eligible to vote. *He was Vetted by Congress
6419 2018-01-27 16:59:39 As a turtle goes, I'll act surprised! But, first, I'll change the oil on my car ...rotate the tires ...bake some cookies (tollhouse ) ...and write a really long tweet...with one hand (cookie in other)...
6420 2018-01-27 16:59:32 I tried baths with oil. I didn’t like it.
6421 2018-01-27 16:59:29 Because there is little oil there so it’s optics. They have no problem slaughtering wildlife & endangering lives in the arctic where there is oil
6422 2018-01-27 16:59:22 First , let me help you out.
That ship is a oil burner, not coal fired.
The hull & superstructure is all aluminum, which makes her lite.
Her max speed is 44 knots, which in mph is just a hair faster than 50 mph, faster than most of our current military ships.

Neat boat.
6423 2018-01-27 16:59:17 Don't put the lives of Kenyans in peril. Water should  be clean, quality and fit for drinking. Why allow oil spill in water. Wait for diseases as cancer etl. #Shameful
6424 2018-01-27 16:59:16 the fact that you don't specify what kind of oil makes this tweet very disturbing
6425 2018-01-27 16:59:16 Maybe try the oil.
6426 2018-01-27 16:59:14 yes! coconut oil is safe for them

6442 2018-01-27 16:57:54 Yeah,we could have been at your place 

Even then I wouldn't considered my club succes with an oil owner a success,it will be a trophy but a trophy bought with money 
I would have accepted the truth
6443 2018-01-27 16:57:52 Worst case. A fouled beach in FL or endless casualties in the middle east over oil supplies. Lousy choices but we can clean up a beach

6445 2018-01-27 16:57:48 Capsules full of oregano oil!
6446 2018-01-27 16:57:42 Use coconut oil :)
6447 2018-01-27 16:57:40 Tbh, the only thing that gets me off is the notion of thick oil paint hitting canvas, or galkyd-y af glazes dripping off the surface. LIKE DAMN.
6448 2018-01-27 16:57:30 Hey Ryan if you want it to flow freely, have lots of coconut oil. Holy cow I learned my lesson. Cleaned me right out hahaha

6453 2018-01-27 16:56:53 So i’m in a new mom support group (long story) but these white women....really be putting coconut oil on their babies’ rashes.....as if that’s gon do anything.....

4. #Oil Pipelines are back at full capacity
5. Russian sanctions
6456 2018-01-27 16:56:35 I just use coconut oil or olive oil. Anything else sets me off. Been like that for years  which is why this reaction is so odd. So it must be the tablets
6457 2018-01-27 16:56:30 We’re both like oil.
I’m cultured and you’re crude.
6458 2018-01-27 16:56:24 伝えてるのにそれはやばい。普通に危険人物
6459 2018-01-27 16:56:24 @frenchsfrys our fish and chips last night were the best ever. The chips seemed different. Are you using a different oil?
6460 2018-01-27 16:56:20 But we have to get the oil out. Alberta is landlocked in Canada with USA buying our oil at a big discount.
6461 2018-01-27 16:56:17 The trick to real movie flavored popcorn is to use butter-flavored coconut oil.
6462 2018-01-27 16:55:55 So my car has Bluetooth for my phone and I’m getting the oil changed so I go inside the lounge and I guess my phone was still in range so when the worker guy started to drive it Bartier Cardi started blasting and I wanna crawl into a hole forever and never come out
6463 2018-01-27 16:55:45 Nivea juga ga cocok? Aku gatau sih kalo dry soalnya kulitku oily :") eh pake face oil ga?? Kalo ga coba dipakein. Lumayan bikin lembab loh
6464 2018-01-27 16:55:45 Interesting thought....but STILL the largest oil consumer in the world - by a distance! 9mn bopd isn't it?
6465 2018-01-27 16:55:34 My hair is really growing, thanks to protective styles, Jamaican castor oil, and peppermint oil

6467 2018-01-27 16:55:27 Hey. I’d massage and oil you if you’d ask
6468 2018-01-27 16:55:24 So many  people have no clue how to check their oil, unbelievable how anyone could leave to the yearly service to check oil. Add in brake fluid, tyre pressures and wear and changing a faulty lamp it's not rocket science folks.  #gaymechanicsarerreal #notjustaprettyface
6469 2018-01-27 16:55:21 O oil น้ำมัน #TeamGOT7 #TwitterBestFandom

6472 2018-01-27 16:55:06 Hella long but it’s the oil
6473 2018-01-27 16:55:01 A basic cars class that's a requirement. I think everyone should know how to check their oil, change a tire, air filter, etc. Just the basics. And maybe how to do your taxes.
6474 2018-01-27 16:55:00 ....We welcome the military to the American cause...we dont want you to end up in Syria protecting Putin oil fields. Tillerson  all that money not enough...
6475 2018-01-27 16:54:51 i der friends, Andy's mum here. Andy came back from his walk yesterday coated in diesel oil. Must have been coming from the diesel tank of a passing vehicle. After several baths and carefully grooming, pleased to report that Andy is now free from the oil.  Back tomorrow.
6476 2018-01-27 16:54:36 i eat my pizzas with three tablespoons of warm oil
6477 2018-01-27 16:54:35 No money, no oil, no natural gas, no mining products, nothing. We can sell everything to the global market.

6479 2018-01-27 16:54:31 Sitting at the tire shop waiting for an oil change. I had a 10:30 apt my car hasn't moved from where I parked it. So glad I made an appointment. Getting pissy!!!
6480 2018-01-27 16:54:24 Not just oil. Power. Power corrupts.

Business is corrupt, and American businesses have been sponsors of more kleptocracies than any other source of influence.

You're not telling me anything new here, you're just generalizing a vague impression, which is more than rash.
6481 2018-01-27 16:54:20 Haha! I’ve shares in Oil of Ulay!

6485 2018-01-27 16:53:15 रिसर्च बताते है कि एक लड़की अपने पूरे जीवन में अपने गालों से इतना oil छोड़ती है

6501 2018-01-27 16:50:40 The weak dollar will help multi nationals but actually slow US economy. Trade deficit will expand by around 200b that's 1% GDP. Higher oil and interest rates will also slow the economy. Tax and regulation changes will help growth.
6502 2018-01-27 16:50:38 Things of value are beneath the surface. You might have to dig, drill, pry, or swim to get to diamonds, pearls, or oil but it's worth the work. OR, you could settle for the dirt or water on the surface. #beagoaldigger

6508 2018-01-27 16:49:18 Whole cloves / oil of cloves either held against or rubbed on to the pain area works well in the short term.
6509 2018-01-27 16:49:18 This tweet brought to you by: someone who uses oil products everyday!
6510 2018-01-27 16:49:03 I would recommend a soap with as few additives as possible. I've turned to the "free and clear" products, but have never really had a problem with fragrant soaps. There just isn't enough fragrance oil volume or soak time to affect the latex in a single wash.
6511 2018-01-27 16:49:02 Awak private tweet cane nk baca. And double cleansing tu maksudnya first step cuci guna oil-based then second step cuci guna water-based. Eg. First guna oil cleansing and second guna la pape pencuci muka yg hg guna.

6522 2018-01-27 16:47:53 Honestly I’m not really an expert on this but my understanding is that while the production process for plastic is less energy intensive than for glass, the raw materials are much more so, as plastic is made (generally) from oil and glass from sand/rock
6523 2018-01-27 16:47:37 reasons kitchen work is good:

-deli slicer incident
-fist fighting dishwasher
-hot

6525 2018-01-27 16:47:25 I hate when I get my oil changed and then they’re like “you need all new tires” my tires were just replaced so stfu.
6526 2018-01-27 16:47:14 Or turning oil reserves into BTC via mining before being deposed.
6527 2018-01-27 16:46:59 Sell your soul for coal and oil!  Would have been his honest campaign point.
6528 2018-01-27 16:46:59 Is it now? Do you know that oil naturally seeps into the oceans?
6529 2018-01-27 16:46:58 Baby oil is better than most creams

6536 2018-01-27 16:46:10 Are you sure you're not talking about Trump and Republicans?Huge tax cuts for wealthy thru taxscam, repeated attempts to repeal Obamacare, killed Net Neutrality, open Both coasts and National parks to oil drilling,Climate Change deniers, repeal protections for clean air, water..

6538 2018-01-27 16:45:44 Only if there is enough oil to be profitable. Is there?
6539 2018-01-27 16:45:43 It would make a great SF novel though, especially if the work in hovercraft/hovertanks. Maybe not oil though. How about fighting over the actual ice (future water shortage fiction)?
6540 2018-01-27 16:45:18 I don't know if it's specifically anti-frizz, but I really like "L'Oréal Elvital Maqigue oil". I think it's called "Elvive extraordinary oil" in the UK. Makes your hair so sooft
6541 2018-01-27 16:45:18 Where is the Henry Kissinger quote? " Historians will write that Trump with oil independence wipes out debt & rebuilding inner cities plus eliminate poverty will be rated as greatest POTUS of all time"

6544 2018-01-27 16:45:04 Thanks! It’s a hobby that got out of control. Now I wish to learn to draw and make handmade art. I’ve done a few abstract landscapes in oil on canvas. But abstract expressionism, as much as I like it, has run its course.
6545 2018-01-27 16:44:48 The slowdown in 2018 demand growth is mainly due to the impact of higher oil prices, changing patterns of oil use in China, recent weakness in OECD demand and the switch to natural gas in several non-OECD countries.
6546 2018-01-27 16:44:47 Of course I can’t get a regular oil change. Oh how beautiful to want the finer things in life.
6547 2018-01-27 16:44:44 包容で鼻血とまるかもしれませんね！！！！！
6548 2018-01-27 16:44:39 what's wrong with palm oil?
6549 2018-01-27 16:44:35 Damn I don’t feel like getting an oil change 
6550 2018-01-27 16:44:34 You know you’re domesticated when you keep looking out the window waiting for an Amazon box with cast iron oil and Brillo pads inside, and you’re excited about it.
6551 2018-01-27 16:44:33 I have tea tree oil shampoo, tea tree oil face wash, tea tree oil face peeling, tea tree oil moisturizer and a tea tree oil face mask and im slowly getting sick of the scent
6552 2018-01-27 16:44:32 We separate, we sell a lot of oil and we establish our own military. Then we will have some power. We control immigration, we control government handouts to countries,we control our lives. Not 6.5 million in Toronto.
6553 2018-01-27 16:44:22 Your fingers are probably swollen. Cool off. If it’s still not off put your hand in cold water and then put some oil on your finger around the ring
6554 2018-01-27 16:44:09 “OIL” LMAO
6555 2018-01-27 16:44:03 The EPA just loosened air pollution requirements.  These requirements were aimed at the worse polluters in the fossil fuel industry.  I suspect all of Trump's actions to benefit the coal and oil industries can be tied directly to his investment portfolio.  1/2
6556 2018-01-27 16:43:49 I HATE GETTING OIL CHANGES! This shit takes forever!

6558 2018-01-27 16:43:22 Todays old man advice

Tea tree oil/olive oil mixed together does wonders for those bumps you may get after shaving
6559 2018-01-27 16:43:20 Sure but with this tight market and us not having oil fields in the back hand we can primarily react to opportunities like the Auba case is currently
6560 2018-01-27 16:43:20 Saturday is #SHATTERDAY! 15% off all shatter and dabs!  Get your oil fix with 15% off up to two (2) grams of oil all day Saturday! #PDXdeals
6561 2018-01-27 16:42:53 It’s unlawful to invade another country and seize land as well. Russia has GOT to get its act together if they want to get out of isolation. As oil loses Russia will fade from the world scene.
6562 2018-01-27 16:42:52 In this case they were making faces like it was cod liver oil, so I'm pretty sure it's just the beer.

6569 2018-01-27 16:41:36 Obama killed our economy in his last 4 years in office.  Supported racial deconstruction of our society.  Supported violence Against law enforcement. Because of that and increased regulations, and taxes on companies, the blocks on the oil industry. All caused many problems.

The drop in oil prices hurt badly, but (thanks in part to even-handed NDP policies) Alberta is on the mend) #ableg

6575 2018-01-27 16:41:16 This is a fluke Mr. @NGRPresident simply because the ordinary man on the street is yet to feel the impact of your tenure. Increasing the price of oil will only help the rich class amass more wealth while the poor gets poorer. Where is the middles class sef?

6587 2018-01-27 16:39:28 Excellent presentation. Commercial EVs will be the big energy story soon. High utilization in commercial use means outsized impact on fuel consumption. 16GWh of EV buses displaces several times more oil per day than 20.5GWh of EV cars.

6601 2018-01-27 16:38:07 @HumanNaturePhil By the way, I have a question: are your essential oils, e.g. tea tree & eucalyptus, 100% pure? Can I use them in an electric aromatherapy diffuser? My diffuser's user manual says to only use 100% essential oil without other chemicals.
6602 2018-01-27 16:37:59 I winged a bit. 8 ounces strong flour, punch salt, splash oil, threw in some nigella seeds, packet yeast. Needed in the magimix, proved for 1hr, knocked back, cut into 8, splash oil on board, slapped flat to about 5mm. 10 mins in v hot oven on floured tray.

6704 2018-01-28 23:59:02 it's like a oven/fryer hybrid without all of the oil. I made mac and cheese, cinnamon rolls and cake in it too. That's saying alot because I'm allergic to the kitchen.

6733 2018-01-28 23:58:18 Mr. Honorable kindly explain the reason why oil prices are hiking since daily fluctuation rate was implemented. The whole country knows that fair price should be cut to half of the current prices.why big private players are not made accountable for corruption.

6741 2018-01-28 23:57:27 I learned how to deliver the facts doing Oilfield Services Sales in downtown Calgary for 2 years...you never know when an oil company CEO is going to get in the elevator with you! There are 1000+ oil company HQ's in 1 square mile there!

6747 2018-01-28 23:56:36 I think you should drop the alcohol and drink coconut oil, it's musch better in miami
6748 2018-01-28 23:56:36 Love @_nomap 's suggestion, but simpler is:
1" dice, steam til tender (15 min?), mash (food mill!), stir in butter, cream, pinch salt, nutmeg. mb balsamic drizzle?
OR
1.5-2" dice, toss in oil, S&P, rosemary, thyme. Roast hot and long, like carrots.
6749 2018-01-28 23:56:24 coconut oil makes my body feel so refreshed

6763 2018-01-28 23:54:24 #NAFTA is terrible for #Canada. It enforces us to mandatorily sell our oil to the US. #That's why we have no east west #pipelines. They buy it for $24 mix it and sell for $70. Then they sell us #gasoline in USD. Same with Natural Gas, buying it for next to nothing & sell abroad

6773 2018-01-28 23:52:35 Trump donates $100 billion to Arabia as foregn aid even though they swim in oil, Arabia buys American weapons which was the plan. So America donates expecting nations to buy their guns with they money America give them. Don't mind until the guns are pointed at our boys.

6776 2018-01-28 23:52:07 Yes and I also put a drop of doterra essential oil 'on guard' with it. My jaw/mouth gets sore. Pulls out toxins.

6778 2018-01-28 23:51:55 If we don’t break it at Lucas Oil, it should be a huge disappointment
6779 2018-01-28 23:51:45 just make it good oil...no canola or soybean nonsense and no added sugar or corn syrup. Basically nothing you’ll find in a store or restaurant. Fat soluble vitamins: A, D, E, and K.
6780 2018-01-28 23:51:10 GIRL blend avocado, olive oil and a egg yolk. You cover your hair and scalp completely with it. Then you put on a plastic cap or girl even a bag who cares !! And you blow dry it for 30 minutes. (I didn’t blow dry it, but if you want way better results go for it)
6781 2018-01-28 23:50:38 It definitely could be. I’d try using it as the last oil you use and only putting it on your ends or not using it altogether to see how your hair responds.
6782 2018-01-28 23:50:37 We are not giving our market share to Russia. China or France . New England buying Russian oil so much for windmills to keep them warm . Genius it's clean energy .
6783 2018-01-28 23:50:32 @TessaJowell Avoid aspartam as used in diet coke,sugary food and eat brocolli,feta, cheese, eggs, garlic,tumeric,cabbage and butter + olive oil frequently.

6786 2018-01-28 23:49:30 It’s time we bring our men home. Afghanistan is a mess always was. There is no freedom drugs and oil rule. We gave money to its government to pay off the abusers the people didn’t see it Trump loves violence he will bring it 2 us

6791 2018-01-28 23:49:00 This is going to be a very exciting week for @IndyEleven supporters. IF we do end up at Lucas Oil for our first home game against @fccincinnati , our goal has to be break our home attendance record. 

My goal for our opener: 18k! @The_BYB @cincysoccertalk
6792 2018-01-28 23:48:58 We don't get our oil from Saudis Arabia , they aren't even the number one producer.
6793 2018-01-28 23:48:52 Trump interviewed by Piers Morgan on ITV here in Scotland. Interviewer gave ‘sycophancy’ new meaning- should now be ‘psychofantasy’. Trump’s now most beautiful ecowarrior “loves clear blue water”. Once told Scotgov to move offshore oil rigs -they spoilt view from his golf course
6794 2018-01-28 23:48:49 “He sold it before they found oil on it”
6795 2018-01-28 23:48:34 I'm sorta nervous because my parents told me that my first words were 'oil can'...lol
6796 2018-01-28 23:48:27 @realDonaldTrump  I read that we have a lot of oil more than Russia. Why are we having to spend more at the gas pump? Will you please help us with this and get the gas prices down at the pump especially since we have so much oil! Thank you.
6797 2018-01-28 23:48:17 same puddle, different straw?
6798 2018-01-28 23:48:01 Ask new New England how their windmills are keeping them warm . They are buying Russian oil
6799 2018-01-28 23:47:58 We pretty much do- there is no right to receive any oil when you own a dollar bill. The "backing" is simply if you want to buy  oil from Saudi Arabia you need to get yourselves some dollars. Its like saying most ICO's are "backed by Ethereum" because you need ETH to buy them
6800 2018-01-28 23:47:57 I recently starting using it a lot more and my hair is not doing so well. I thought maybe it was the weather. But now I’m wondering if it’s the coconut oil
6801 2018-01-28 23:47:56 Which one @AlbertsStuff
6802 2018-01-28 23:47:52 It is a tad oil shiny at the top/roots I didn't notice before
6803 2018-01-28 23:47:43 people are really still out here putting coconut oil on their face I’m cringing
6804 2018-01-28 23:47:30 Why am I suddenly allergic to this oil? Ah
6805 2018-01-28 23:47:29 I looked, and behold, a black horse; and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand. And I heard something like a voice ...saying... “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; but do not damage the oil and the wine.”

6811 2018-01-28 23:46:42 I love organic jojoba oil
6812 2018-01-28 23:45:49 What currency do you use when you go abroad ... Exactly, any currency you like. Oil currently $70 after USA, Russia & Saudi stop playing games (no one, not even you foresaw that) and it's on the increase again. A.Salmond: "Oil is a Bonus, the Icing on the cake".

6821 2018-01-28 23:44:27 Couldn’t agree more on he latter part. Dollar drives oil though not the other way around. This move in oil is solely due to the decline in dollar.

That you obviously have race problems, I currently possess 4 separate Resident Visa's in Africa countries, means spent years working in Africa & didn't visit tourist destinations
6824 2018-01-28 23:43:59 One time I used it on my legs after waxing n I literally got spots on my FUKIN LEGS like can u BELEEVE IT COCONUT OIL IS SENT STRAIGHT FROM THE DEVIL
6825 2018-01-28 23:43:49 Veracrypt and secure boot.

Oil and water?
6826 2018-01-28 23:43:42 It makes sense then that paper currencies would rather use oil than gold.  And therefore why Bitcoin is attacked vocally more by precious metal dealers than by banks.  The paper currencies are still better as currencies, but Bitcoin is a better store of value than gold (arguably)

6836 2018-01-28 23:42:37 I did some temporary duty at Sig during the US escorting of Kuwaiti oil tankers during Iran/Iraq War. Worked on flight line with air cargo heading to the US ships in Persian Gulf. We had no real supply chain at that time.

6839 2018-01-28 23:42:26 for oil based things you can still comfortably use a slin pin, as small as 28 gauge. The trick is to heat it before drawing. Drawing is slow, but it's overall easier. This is also best for long esters b/c absorption can be slower
6840 2018-01-28 23:41:50 It took firestone 2 hours to do my oil change and believe it or not it was quicker than last time . both times I had appointments.
6841 2018-01-28 23:41:39 I just fried some dumplings and the oil got all splattery and now my kitchen is a slip n slide and I just body slammed my wall
6842 2018-01-28 23:41:09 Well let them piss their money away.  Most people are on to what the Koch brothers stand for.  Corruption and power.  It’s hilarious that their companies, say, they do GREAT THINGS!! Yep, pollution and oil.  Wait for it!!
DPL leak!!
6843 2018-01-28 23:40:56 On a better side of things my real dad gave me like half an ounce of weed, plus hella dab oil and 2 10g samples  my family is A1 25/8 
6844 2018-01-28 23:40:54 Girl they don’t know. If you have oily ass skin, don’t put oil on your face. Lol that’s all
6845 2018-01-28 23:40:52 part of the wm plan to impoverish Scotland, isn't that how colonialism worked/works? IR2 will need to be sooner rather than later or we will be stripped bare of everything in order for wm to hold power over the only thing propping up their debt, our oil and gas
6846 2018-01-28 23:40:40 hand me that oil , Issa wrap .
6847 2018-01-28 23:40:31 Chris is explaining JoJo to me and all I heard was "speedwagon owns a BUNCH of oil companies" what kind of crack are all on
6848 2018-01-28 23:40:26 So what's the problem? Nutella is very sweet, the sugar shouldn't be a surprise. Palm oil by itself isn't bad- although I wouldn't recommend making it your #1 source of fat. It's a more saturated fat, yes, but is a good substitute for trans fats- which are bad all over.

6852 2018-01-28 23:39:54 I’m not a licensed cosmetologist but I’ve found that coconut oil is a sealant. So I noticed using it as my main oil was awful and my hair was dry and breaking. So I use it only to seal in moisture from other oils (tea tree, argan, jojoba, and grape seed) for better results
6853 2018-01-28 23:39:51 This type of judgement was relied on to negotiate Iran deal? How accurate was he in determining intentions & capabilities of Iranians?

6860 2018-01-28 23:38:23 Correct, making gold superior "money" even though oil is more useful
6861 2018-01-28 23:38:17 Scotland doesn't have to choose between markets, Indy Scotland will trade, as now, with rUK, EU & World markets.  England relies on Scotland for 60% of exports. Also reliant on Electricity, Gas, Oil, Water, Indy Scotland's will do just fine thanks.

6864 2018-01-28 23:38:02 Whipped shea butter and I made my own MSM/Vitamin C serum.  Also used a coconut oil based soap by nubian heritage. But coconut oil is the only thing I still consistently use

6870 2018-01-28 23:37:18 I have coconut oil on my face and in my hair and my cat thinks I'm food now. I will probably be eaten alive in my sleep, it's been nice knowing you all.
6871 2018-01-28 23:37:03 Oil kinda needs paper currencies that is, whereas precious metals can stand on their own.
6872 2018-01-28 23:36:36 fenty filt’r foundation. super watery, oxidizes orange, and oil shines through after 2 hours at MOST. def not worth the hype
6873 2018-01-28 23:36:35 I tried cool as a cucumber with cucumber and aloe extract. I also bought totally tea-riffic which is tea tree oil and licorice root. That one is happening tonight 
6874 2018-01-28 23:36:32 I'm looking for a #gfx #artist for a #twitch #overlay idea. Someone that does oil painted or smoothed art look. Bump if you know anyone.
6875 2018-01-28 23:36:31 Or pure truffle oil! 
6876 2018-01-28 23:36:28 Depends on price.  30 MP+ will be to good for arsenal to turn down.  Shame as oil vastly superior to welbeck, very good situational CF.

6879 2018-01-28 23:36:16 Absolutely right. You need fat to absorb nutrients. Drench to your taste. Key is that fat doesn’t affect glucose. Use lower carb dressing and put butter or olive oil on your veges too
6880 2018-01-28 23:36:14 Regardless though, I think this thread has determined that even though oil and gold can both "back" a paper currency, that backing is in a different relationship. Correct?
6881 2018-01-28 23:36:04 The danger is that complacency over the oil price could once again deter companies from diversification not just in the O&G sector but across all sectors. Let's not overplay this eh.
6882 2018-01-28 23:35:36 Very much depends on the vegies in the salad, type of dressing and how the salad was prepared. Like if you dump a bucket of 1000 island on some iceberg, you are doing it wrong. If you have spinach/kale/chard and other raw vegies and you make your own olive oil basalmic... maybe..
6883 2018-01-28 23:35:28 Fry in hot oil til golden. Doesn’t take long but you have to Flip & do both sides. Makes them crunchy & insides are warm & gooey. Delish!! I’ve put in muffin pans & baked making cups & filled with whatever.

6885 2018-01-28 23:35:17 That’s what in country renewables can provide. Reliable and cheap energy. No long supply trains of coal moving through boarders. Russia turning your gas off. Arab states pushing up oil prices. Moving to renewables will offer the world more then lower Co2 emissions.

6890 2018-01-28 23:34:59 (Dutch don't trust Shell) No. In the UK those responsible would have sold their stake to a foreign asset/pension-stripper or hedge fund to save their image, after which the victims can go whistle. Similar is happening to Blue-Chip North Sea oil & gas assets.
6891 2018-01-28 23:34:50 Sheela lyer when you do not understand  GDP and how the Of oil works you need to  take management classes. We are in this situation because of 10 years of sick singh and his corrupt congress politicians.

6910 2018-01-28 23:33:04 My understanding is that drenching your salad in salad dressing actually makes it healthier because the oil in the dressing brings out the nutrients in the vegetables and helps your body convert it into energy. Can anyone confirm this?

6920 2018-01-28 23:31:26 Olive oil and it's on the stovetop, so I have no idea how hot it is. I turn it down when it sounds like the lid is going to fly off, which will happen (the sound, not the flying, I think).

6928 2018-01-28 23:29:31 The United States could feed the world if we would not use ethanol in our fuel. Ethanol is a poor fuel choice but the corn to make it is great food. Burn oil, eat corn, and ignore the wacky Libs.

Trump ain’t no good, he’s a snake oil salesman and lies when he opens his mouth.

Ain’t no president in that man
6942 2018-01-28 23:26:27 I cannot belief he actually announcing that! It's like admitting you work closely with a country or you invade them because you need their oil! Has USA EVER admitted they sell arms? It's like he's been stripped of all things moral!
6943 2018-01-28 23:26:23 Especially if it would mean he didn't have to pony up any messy mega divorce settlements! ( futures in Russian Oil or Oligarchs maybe?)
6944 2018-01-28 23:26:21 Oil is fast money and Farm is hard work before the money. We need to be ready for when Oil losses its value. A Time is coming .. When Clean Energy will be the order of the day.
6945 2018-01-28 23:26:07 So you point out that oil is not portable and dangerous to transport which makes it backing paper currencies a better symbiotic relationship (and also because it's consumable) than gold which is contentious with paper currencies since it can be horded and keep supply in check.
6946 2018-01-28 23:25:55 Also to help with lost edges she can massage oils like Jamaican black castor and peppermint oil on them.
6947 2018-01-28 23:25:45 coconut oil has honestly made my skin so much better. i have fewer breakouts and it works amazing for a makeup remover

6952 2018-01-28 23:25:14 No, we didn't mis-hear "It's fve o'clock Bulova Watch Time" as "Oysters will spoil if you boil them in oil" but we did mis-hear more than we do with CD / DAT quality recording. ;-)
6953 2018-01-28 23:25:12 It was brilliant. And moving. And utterly heartbreaking. I felt shame as a human and have had to check my cupboards. Palm oil will no longer be welcome. Thank you for driving it home.
6954 2018-01-28 23:25:09 Like they say: "the squeaky wheel gets the oil." We need to make noise. We have been cast aside and ignored for too long.

6965 2018-01-28 23:23:15 The tax bill helping the poor?  It’s a lie because it will not help the poor, it will over next few years increase poor’s and middle class’ taxes. It is snake oil, small 1st yr gain lost by big 2nd, 3rd and so on increases

6982 2018-01-28 23:20:13 I applaud you and thankfully you and Chris Murphy represent us as truth tellers. It was always about the Rosneft Oil Deal and laundered money, now about Obstruction of Justice and Conspiracy Against The United States.

6984 2018-01-28 23:19:59 Incredible programme @ChrisGPackham. I saw extensive palm oil in Sabah. One remote community was living on the edge of a growing plantation. I was building a solar workshop there with an NGO, I could relate a lot. So sad to see a rainforest converted to monoculture palm oil.

6990 2018-01-28 23:19:09 I like to say in regard to the GOP...there is a difference between believing what you say, and saying you believe something because it furthers your narrative. We see this when they deny climate change to argue for more oil drilling.
6991 2018-01-28 23:19:07 Lol idk why I thought it was lmao , I just got this coconut oil lol but I heard grape seed oil was beautiful
6992 2018-01-28 23:18:58 Liberal tears are delicious.

6994 2018-01-28 23:18:50 Just a reminder that security experts are the snake oil salesmen of the modern day..

6999 2018-01-28 23:18:37 Surely the growing of palm oil is a major environmental issue.
Why don't we hear more about it?

There's always alternatives 
We banned the old fashioned bulbs
We developed suitable alternatives....

7000 2018-01-28 23:18:24 Current obsession: making cauliflower sushi rice: start with fresh or frozen, mix in maybe a capful of seasoned rice vinegar then nuke the shit out of it at 2 to 3 min intervals, periodically fluffing & letting steam out of microwave. Fluff again & mix in a bit of coconut oil.

7002 2018-01-28 23:18:11 Make sure you take it out of fridge at least 30 mins before, and make sure pan is as hot as you can get it. Season and oil the steak not the pan. Cook either side depending on how you like it, add butter to pan and baste. Rest for however long you cooked it for.
7003 2018-01-28 23:18:08 PEA/Mikhi/Rambo/Laca and Ozil - City will need to get digging for oil for next season

7005 2018-01-28 23:17:59 No but I did try brushing my teeth with coconut oil for a few weeks it's a good whitener but I went back to toothpaste. I do use coconut oil for cooking and on my dog
7006 2018-01-28 23:17:53 Every sector kukuma should ask for subsidy or colony as well. Tech colony, service colony, architecture colony, industrial colony, banking colony,.oil colony, traders colony etc.
7007 2018-01-28 23:17:40 I'd love to live palm oil-free, but as is nearly always the case, the palm oil-free alternatives are much more expensive than the products with palm oil in them. To make it easier, the palm oil-free products need to be cheaper.

7010 2018-01-28 23:17:21 Coconut oil made me fat AF and makes my skin so dry  hate it, don’t know why everybody thinks it’s the solution for everything
7011 2018-01-28 23:17:21 There is an apocryphal story that tankers share where Rommel somehow used the oil from peanut butter as diesel fuel.

7015 2018-01-28 23:16:45 help. i put coconut oil in my hair (the actual stuff that can go in your hair not the cooking shit) and now it looks greasy. so that means washing my hair at 5:30 tomorrow morning so it looks presentable for the world. good job robyn, fucking good job

7019 2018-01-28 23:16:25 The world will never know how sad I am

7026 2018-01-28 23:15:50 Coconut oil is never the best. Especially the face. It is super comedogenic as hell.
7027 2018-01-28 23:15:41 What the hell? @jameslankford @tedcruz is this true? Going to be some very upset oil and gas states if this is happening.
7028 2018-01-28 23:15:39 A Diesel can run on vegetable oil (still emitting CO2, though), but I doubt that petrol can be replaced by water. By hydrogen, maybe, but that would cause other problems such as extremely high humidity in cities leading to mould with all its health problems.
7029 2018-01-28 23:15:29 I made it! Coconut oil, sugar, and lemon extract
7030 2018-01-28 23:15:03 soooo everybody used to be in love with coconut oil & now all of a sudden everyone knows every oil that's ever exists & swears they work

7035 2018-01-28 23:14:27 I have. I have used just regular oil. Olive oil. It really works but I only make it about 10 minutes. LOL
7036 2018-01-28 23:14:04 Each war has its own motivation.  Most are fought for economic reasons, but that does not make them necessarily bad.  The first Iraq war for example was fought over control of oil, but did we really want to let Saddam Hussein control 60% of the world's oil?  Of course not!
7037 2018-01-28 23:13:51 @DouglasOllivant Afghanistan may not have all the bells & whistles of a "stable" society, but they do have the poppy...The war there has never been about terrorism, but about control of a very lucrative product sought by many Western countries much in the same way oil is in Iraq.
7038 2018-01-28 23:13:40 I do oil/vinegar
7039 2018-01-28 23:13:33 So what is the advantage of using palm oil if they already have other recipes in use?  Simply a cost issue?

7041 2018-01-28 23:13:26 In addition to the bad ethics palm oil gives me heartburn & other gut issues. I've heard many people say the same. I avoid it & consider it toxic. Very moving documentary.
7042 2018-01-28 23:13:21 I want my damned oil paints back here. It's going to be like 1 week or more without anything to do.

7048 2018-01-28 23:11:53 By the time Dems support 15/hour, inflation will have made that starvation wages.

No dem will ever support the necessary level of green programs funded by taxes on oil
7049 2018-01-28 23:11:51 Yes I do. Definitely need to use some oil on that footstool. Gotta keep it nice and clean.

Better and cheaper.

7088 2018-01-28 23:09:06 Palm Oil is the worst oil (and fat) your body can get. Stay clear of it. You (and your body) are better off eating a spoon of butter.

7133 2018-01-28 23:03:52 Stunning work. This might be the first time I've seen pixel animation look like a moving oil painting.
7134 2018-01-28 23:03:35 The maneuver is desperate because it has been made in obvious acknowledgment of the fact that the petrodollar system's days are numbered. Take away oil backing of the US dollar, and the "exorbitant privilege" disappears as well (along with US military dominance).

7145 2018-01-28 23:02:03 I just tried out a new face moisturizer. It smells like oil paint. Hope it works better than it smells 
7146 2018-01-28 23:01:47 And here I use tea tree oil
7147 2018-01-28 23:01:44 Finally got an oil change 
7148 2018-01-28 23:01:44 Fair enough. I'm trying to figure out how much interest I should take in the draft this year (I would prefer playoffs).  I understand #1 is going to amazing #2-3 are exactly what the Oilers need. But if the Oil drafted 6th or 8th, what kind of quality could they get?
7149 2018-01-28 23:01:34 I just paid $1.47.9 for a litre of gas in #vancouver, the highest since 2014 when a barrel of oil was about $105 and is now about $65. Can anyone tell me why we are getting hosed so badly right now? Any legitimate explanation welcome. #gasprices #toohigh

7152 2018-01-28 23:01:15 Such an interesting and emotive programme Chris. 
So pleased when you found the girl that you photographed 20 years ago. But look how these beautiful people's homes and cultures have been destroyed. 
We need to stop using Palm oil in so many products. #saynotopalmoil
7153 2018-01-28 23:01:14 So I still wear my wig everyday but I try to take my braids out every 2-3 weeks and do a hot oil treatment and deep condition. Then everyday I alternate between Jamaican castor oil and the miracle drops from @darealbbjudy on instagram. I just put it all over my braids and scalp.

7163 2018-01-28 23:00:41 yes, but oil is not better as a currency, its not very portable and dangerous to handle. Whisky or cognac would be better choices than oil for currency, but gold still probably far better. Bitcoin is a better currency, but has no versatile function- cant be worn, used otherwise

7180 2018-01-28 22:58:20 The easiest way to puff up the economy, pump up the stock market,  and get oil prices back up for Exxon-Mobile is to pump up the military and start a war.  I say the American teachers, homeless, and veterans are better choices.
7181 2018-01-28 22:58:00 Climate change will take away any economic benefits that low oil prices give.

We already lost billions in the economy last year due to hurricanes, floods, and fires. It will only get worse.

Sorry I hate being negative but it is a real threat to the economy.

7190 2018-01-28 22:56:44 So could it be said that Gold which has been used for thousands of years because there was nothing better as a currency until something better came along such as oil which has better utility and fungibility with similar durability qualities?

7210 2018-01-28 22:54:22 To the contrary, the real issue is not oil exporter vs. oil importer, but rather the capability of the US to perpetuate USD hegemony, and the "exorbitant privilege" that hegemony has afforded the US for the past half decade. +

7214 2018-01-28 22:53:56 I probably won't play bonds, but my outlook for the next several weeks is dollar going up, oil and other commodities going down, inflation trade going down, yields going down. As of Friday, DSI is 15 for T-Notes and 26 for T-Bonds, and T-Notes CoT is the most short in 3.5 years.
7215 2018-01-28 22:53:29 Quality olive oil should be a staple in everyone’s pantry
7216 2018-01-28 22:53:24 Consensus, archetypical societal agreement b/c its rarity & properties (color, malleability, indestructibility [oil gets used up]) gold has value.Very similar to the consensus agreement that BTC has value (transferability, trustless). Neither gold nor btc make good hair products
7217 2018-01-28 22:53:19 And fracking / fossil fuels aren't just as destructive?  Let's be real here - we need to be rid of all fossil fuels as soon as possible, and storing as much as possible in the strategic oil reserve

7229 2018-01-28 22:51:39 Wonderful programme and so pleased you were reunited with the girl from the photo. A powerful message, well made about the utter devastation caused by the palm oil industry. We all need to do our part to end the destruction and save the globally important rainforests.
7230 2018-01-28 22:51:31 I want to assure Nigerians that every additional income that comes to the Federal Government in 2018, from the rising price of crude oil, will be deployed to infrastructure projects: roads, rail, and power, for the benefit of all our people. #TheYearOfInfrastructure
7231 2018-01-28 22:51:26 Great interview there with @piersmorgan and @realDonaldTrump  things are looking brighter for when we leave the EU, business is booming and oil prices rising to stability!! Keep it up POTUS. Hopefully oil giants will start drilling again ASAP.

7238 2018-01-28 22:50:52 I consider your statement to be based in ignorance of the true nature of economically accessible US shale oil reserves. In any case, even were these reserves effectively limitless and cheap, a switch to energy exporter will accelerate the US's rapid transition to an EM economy.
7239 2018-01-28 22:50:40 We will not repeat the mistakes of the past, when as a country we failed to fully utilize rising oil prices to develop our infrastructure. Our administration's pledge to you is that we will make every Naira count, for the development of Nigeria. #TheYearOfInfrastructure

7248 2018-01-28 22:49:38 It’s still been used globally. It’s more cheaper than oil to operate big factories

7261 2018-01-28 22:48:23 But since we’re on the “Left Coast” and didn’t vote for @realDonaldTrump I doubt any aid will be coming soon.  But we can count on oil rigs off our coast

7263 2018-01-28 22:48:03 ´Just 1drop of certified 100% Geranium Pure Essence Oil can help you cleanse & purify your throat Josh, just pour it in 1 litre water to drink or just 1 table-spoon baking soda in one cup of boiling water, dissolve it there, stir it, wait until it temperates to prevent a burning

7268 2018-01-28 22:47:46 @ChrisGPackham @BBCEarth moving programme leaves me questioning how we halt the relentless demand for Palm Oil #Insearchofthelostgirl
7269 2018-01-28 22:47:32 I remember exactly where I was upon hearing this happen. I had just moved to NYC, working at an Oil company as an Exec AA to the Treasurer. It was devastating and it was before the Internet, so only way to hear it live was via a TV we rolled into the Executive area. So sad. 
7270 2018-01-28 22:47:26 Ok, ok. If oil is valuable because it's used in everything from fuel to hair products and cleaning supplies. What makes gold valuable?
7271 2018-01-28 22:47:20 @ChrisGPackham Just watched your programme. Avoided products with palm oil for a few years. Went on Google map and zoomed in and horrified by all the palm plantations, but you are right, we all need to work with nature.

7276 2018-01-28 22:46:41 As the world moves forward with renewable energy & the jobs progress brings, Trump & fossilized cronies cling to coal & oil, refusing to relinquish outdated dirty sources of wealth. Are they not aware of fate of dinosaurs?
7277 2018-01-28 22:46:40 why are we not supposed to put coconut oil on our face now ? i thought it was a good thing

7285 2018-01-28 22:45:32 That and some castor oil and you’ve got RC fuel!
7286 2018-01-28 22:45:30 I don’t care what yall been saying, COCONUT OIL IS LIFE 
7287 2018-01-28 22:45:30 True - Afraid they bet on the false boost from housing / debt & banked on "growth." That's unwinding now. Someone told them tar sands oil will back the loonie.
7288 2018-01-28 22:45:26 The choice is between ethical and unethical oil at least #AB/Canada is out front with policies on climate change can’t say the same for many other oil producing countries
7289 2018-01-28 22:45:25 The lying, the blaming, the cheating AND the insane conspiracy theories! The GOP & their snake oil salesman doofus, DJT, need a little dumbass racist, sexist world all their own, preferably out of this solar system.
7290 2018-01-28 22:45:24 @piersmorgan I didn’t think you could sink any lower and yet tonight you surpassed yourself. What an appalling excuse for journalism. I bet you watched it with some baby oil & a box of Kleenex #twat
7291 2018-01-28 22:45:22 I infused some olive oil with sliced garlic, seasoned shrimp with salt, paprika and cayenne, cooked the shrimp and finished it with a knob of butter and fresh chopped cilantro and basil...best shrimp ever!

7300 2018-01-28 22:44:20 Its not! that's the point. The gold pumpers interjected that after their gold backed/convertible yuan narrative fell apart, arguing that b/c the $ is not a good currency & the Yuan is worse oil producers would convert their yuan and $s into gold, thereby creating gold demand!

7320 2018-01-28 22:42:15 I usually just try to operate on the principle that the less processed food you buy the less palm oil. Am going to do a whizz around the kitchen now...
7321 2018-01-28 22:42:14 Ooo let me know how close it is flavour-wise. I’ve been eating a co-op choc spread which is nice (and fair trade) but just not the same and still has palm oil and is expensive  but is best shop option I’ve found so far.
7322 2018-01-28 22:42:11 Coconut oil or something?

7331 2018-01-28 22:41:46 Unfortunately that's not what she touches on. Plus I have mixed feelings about Palm Oil from talking to quite a few PhD researchers working on the system back home. Europe is the only market for certified 'sustainable' palm oil though, and it is objectively a pretty amazing crop.
7332 2018-01-28 22:41:44 @Smaulgld 

Question: If the USD is backed by oil, and the Yuan is about to be backed by oil. How is this a gold game changer when it backs neither?
7333 2018-01-28 22:41:28 You might wanna oil your dog, sounds like it's got a squeak
7334 2018-01-28 22:41:13 My life is forever changed since I switched to coconut oil and shea butter based moisturization, scrubs, and face cleaning (just oil for that).

7337 2018-01-28 22:40:38 A lot of our nuclear testing where underground we even tried testing it for Shale to see if we can extract the oil out of it didn't work out so well
7338 2018-01-28 22:40:37 I would like to see if Gregory Salcido can troubleshoot an engine on a F-22 or an Apache or any of their avionics. Can he engineer roads or bridges or buildings? Can he troubleshoot a flight simulator down to the chip level? I bet he can't change his own oil!
7339 2018-01-28 22:40:33 I've been with Greenpeace for 25 yrs awa other environmental groups (not amnesty), but the west has huge responsibility that if we stop using palm oil, Indonesians are not reduced to absolute poverty because of our whims and we help them in whatever way...?
7340 2018-01-28 22:40:26 #palmoil Check it out -maybe palm oil has kept 100mio Indonesians out of poverty. Our coscience or their poverty? What will u do diff-zero

7351 2018-01-28 22:38:58 BTW, virtually every commercial kitchen in the nation that utilizes a cook top use gas burners. And the kitchen fires that do happen are almost always due to oil getting too hot and flashing rather than any issue with the equipment itself.

7366 2018-01-28 22:37:16 Very moving and beautiful but also sad. Now on a mission to learn more about palm oil. That vast palm oil plantation looked so omnious.

7372 2018-01-28 22:36:37 Should add a tax for oil and other resource exploitation and raise that basic income, like Alaska, share the wealth of our commons.
7373 2018-01-28 22:36:31 Russia did nkt say they would stop delivering oil to North Korea.

7384 2018-01-28 22:35:18 The big problem is the palm oil.
7385 2018-01-28 22:35:18 The fact that the US is so aggressively selling its own limited oil reserves for USD on the world market is quite clearly an act not indicative of strength, but rather of weakness and, I would argue, desperation.
7386 2018-01-28 22:35:12 I'm covered in dirty ass coolant, oil, metal chips, and sweat. And I'm still having one hell of a Sunday. Almost time for a beer

7388 2018-01-28 22:35:03 The Holy Spirit leading us. It’s the oil that keeps the keeps the fire burning. A price to pay to the fire burning. Psalm 119:105 The Lamp guides us. The lamp is the Word of God. The keeping up of a lamp light is used as a symbol of enduring and unbroken succession.
7389 2018-01-28 22:34:45 That is my point. Oil is a billion dollar business but it is hurting the country. I love Rap. That said, some young inner-city kids that are growing up in tough situations, are being raised / influenced by the wrong messages. Blacks can help blacks by fixing those influences
7390 2018-01-28 22:34:42 Norway has an SWF. Venezuela used oil wealth to bribe political allies and create patronage networks.
7391 2018-01-28 22:34:42 Have just watched your programme it  moved me so much . Checked out palm oil products they are endless,will try very hard to be carefull.
7392 2018-01-28 22:34:36 Try pure shea butter as a moisturizer and black Jamaican castor oil as a sealant to retain moisture. Also treat her hair at home
7393 2018-01-28 22:34:18 I wish people would stop thinking using coconut oil in cooking is better than evoo.  
7394 2018-01-28 22:34:14 That looks delicious! I recommend five 1000 mg of Carlson's Fish Oil on the side and a large cup of hot water with a lemon juice. Ok, now we're ready

7396 2018-01-28 22:33:59 So much cattle grazing alongside oil rigs. Both heads going up and down to the soil...one endangering the land & water for which the other depends on. Ughh. #environment
7397 2018-01-28 22:33:54 Mom asked if she should get extra virgin olive oil. Without hesitation I asked if there was any extra slutty
7398 2018-01-28 22:33:52 Yes @JennyMcCarthy , rubbing tea tree oil on your son’s temples definitely cured all 72 of his food allergies. 
7399 2018-01-28 22:33:50 put a single drop of peppermint oil on my tongue and suddenly could see into 5 different dimensions
7400 2018-01-28 22:33:48 Norway managed its oil wealth differently than Venezuela.  And what keeps the euro countries back is not having a sovereign currency.

7402 2018-01-28 22:33:20 organic coconut oil works !!!!
7403 2018-01-28 22:33:19 Why are people against using coconut oil now
7404 2018-01-28 22:33:18 Just rummaged through my kitchen cupboard and fridge to search for products with #palmoil so I know what to avoid  in future. So far found margarine but apparently that has sustainably sourced palm oil. Is there such a thing?
7405 2018-01-28 22:33:18 dulu diajarinnya pake diusap baby oil, trs ditunggu bentar, trs pake cotton bud pelan2 bersihinnya
7406 2018-01-28 22:33:18 @ChrisGPackham In search of the lost girl. What a show! Absolutely heart breaking to see the distruction that palm oil is doing to the traditional lives of some of Sumatras tribes.

7408 2018-01-28 22:32:39 HOA's are so shitty. Send me a violation because I left my trash can out an extra day because the city missed picking it up. But let an old, non running car leak oil and sit in the street for over a year a few houses down. Makes sense.

7410 2018-01-28 22:32:32 It’s best to not use either bc it can clog your pores and cause cystic acne, but if you do use it, use organic virgin coconut oil.
7411 2018-01-28 22:32:19 Norway is a petro-state w/10 million ppl where the state captures oil revenue and has a gigantic sovereign wealth fund to prevent rent-seeking.

France is a net energy importer. France, and most countries, can't become like Norway.
7412 2018-01-28 22:32:01 I covered Vlad earlier
7413 2018-01-28 22:31:52 Where to break it the vicious circle, tribal people need rainforests for their survival, Indonesia needs land to grow palms for trading with the West, the West could do without palm oil but what would Indonesians then do to make money for their survival? #insearchofthelostgirl
7414 2018-01-28 22:31:44 You gotta cut it into little blocks or slices, season it with stuff bc its essentially flavourless then fry it in a pan with oil until its golden and crispy on the outside !!
7415 2018-01-28 22:31:37 What treaties do you suppose you enjoy? 
Sadly,truthfully, tribes have what the Govt is willing to let them have,and NOTHING more, and if the need fits they'll still do what they want anyway, I.E. the oil pipeline. ...
7416 2018-01-28 22:31:31 Pure argan oil will change your life
7417 2018-01-28 22:31:25 I also use coconut oil on my skin daily. Use it after washing my hair at times but it's amazing for your skin. My skin is always soft, smooth and moisturized.
7418 2018-01-28 22:31:24 thank you! I have lavender oil. (and and aloe plant and a ton of coconut oil...)
7419 2018-01-28 22:31:16 Treated myself (and my hair) to some @OGXBeauty Coconut Miracle Oil. I use straighteners every day so my hair definitely needed some tlc. It is now so soft - I can’t stop touching it! Amazing stuff 
7420 2018-01-28 22:31:06 And history doesn’t exactly encourage believing that corporations are capable or willing to regulate themselves. They are no more trustworthy than the government. An example would be how will oil companies were to take lead out of gasoline.
7421 2018-01-28 22:31:04 Studying Global Ecosystems Management @WrittleOfficial - fantastic programme very thought provoking. Will be even more diligent when shopping for products without palm oil
7422 2018-01-28 22:30:51 If it costs the English a fortune "to Rebuild Hadrians Wall", as you point out, why would England take pleasure in it, and what would Scotland care?

 Scotland would just retain the oil revenue and let you get on with it I expect.
7423 2018-01-28 22:30:39 CTFO has full disclosure on how the oil is extracted and the oil is pure. Click on one of my links and read the product lable from the menu

7426 2018-01-28 22:30:30 Sincere Christians are wise virgins, and hypocrites the foolish ones. Matthew 25:1-13. We need more than a lamp of profession. This teaches us to watch and be ready for the coming of the Lord. Proverbs 13:9-10
 The Oil represents the presence of God in our life.

7428 2018-01-28 22:30:18 what gives me acne just thinking about it: ppl with already-clear skin who use honey as a facial cleanser and potato as toner and coconut/olive oil as a moisturizer y'all make me queazy
7429 2018-01-28 22:30:18 The EU should propose to ban use of soya and rapeseed based biofuels as they use up 10x more land area (deforestation) than palm oil.

7432 2018-01-28 22:29:43 I am okay with using force to protect my rights. I have the right to not have to drink the oil your dumping in the water supply, etc. 

I think we probably agree on that. :)
7433 2018-01-28 22:29:34 Who wants to share with me? I only require the SK poision apple Brush cleaner, SK cotton candy lipscrub, face scrub, face oil & metal glam palette.
7434 2018-01-28 22:29:07 I read about palm oil a while back and it’s completely insane how that shit is legal to acquire/use. We can’t have kinder eggs but god damn take all the palm oil you want
7435 2018-01-28 22:29:07 Chit! It sure looks painful. Lavender essential oil might help it heel faster
7436 2018-01-28 22:28:47 @ChrisGPackham Chris - very moving program trying to find a bit of your past. Even if the west stopped the use of palm oil now, it's too late, the Forrests, and everything that relied on them, have gone. They cannot be replaced!
7437 2018-01-28 22:28:37 Decided to make a healthy snack. Flat rice noodle stir fry in olive oil with baby bok choy, shiitake mushrooms and scallions.

7447 2018-01-28 22:27:03 My wife and I caught the last 1/2 of your program. I have a bunch of intolerances, have to read labels on every food product already. Apart from avoiding things with palm oil when we do happen to use processed food what can we do to support these people Chris?

7450 2018-01-28 22:26:28 #InSearchOfTheLostGirl @ChrisGPackham Thought provoking programme. How can we stop this madness? Trying to avoid palm oil is only part of the solution and not easy. Who has the answer?
7451 2018-01-28 22:26:24 Sounds like you need an oil change
7452 2018-01-28 22:26:18 Hmm. I wonder if a little bit of poison ivy oil was in the smoke.
7453 2018-01-28 22:26:13 Just because it’s less than the national average doesn’t mean we have to like it. Guess big oil elites aren’t buying into the tax relief bill being signed and being happy about it. They just charge more

7461 2018-01-28 22:25:33 yet, the world keeps letting oil companies exist & keeps allowing this. it's abuse. It's letting corporations bully the entire world while they destroy it. so many areas have been harmed. irresponsible of the world to stay on oil for massive energy in any country.
7462 2018-01-28 22:25:22 A leap of faith, yes. But public need to be aware of the extent of risk they are taking at least.
A lot of remainders talk of hidden oil reserves, whisky sent from English ports etc.
No-one will have their opinion changed by this garbage.

7468 2018-01-28 22:24:36 Because you keep invading countries for oil.

7470 2018-01-28 22:24:21 Thank you Chris. Excellent programme and glad (but sad) you found her.

I don't eat or use anything containing palm oil.
7471 2018-01-28 22:24:19 Saddest part for me was how many scis in her mentions. Like cone on. None of this is bad in moderation like ANYTHING. Palm oil is ethically dubious though.
7472 2018-01-28 22:24:08 Probably? It’s not like they weren’t already pursuing expansionist policies prior to the oil embargo.

7474 2018-01-28 22:24:06 Morgan is a snake oil salesman, and Trump is just a fascist.
7475 2018-01-28 22:24:06 Given that you claim to be observant and "alert," I find it incomprehensible that you (apparently) fail to appreciate the import of the fact a bloc of oil-exporting nations, including the largest exporter and the largest reserves, are now selling that oil for RMB, not USD. +
7476 2018-01-28 22:23:59 Want comments? Your aviation livelihood depends on innovative use of fossil fuel. 1) emission-less non-portable electricity is powered mainly by fossil fuel 2) BC contributes more CO2 by tree cutting than oil 3) do an EIS on batteries 4)Victoria dumps sewage. clean up your yard.

7480 2018-01-28 22:22:55 questionable if any palm oil product is good for wildlife. Sustainable doesnt mean good for nature
7481 2018-01-28 22:22:36 Real progressives know a snake oil selling con man when they see one, and know how to get things get done.  This fraud only championed one bill - dumping nuclear waste on poor latinx for the org that paid Jane.

7484 2018-01-28 22:22:13 Yes! 1 tablespoon of castor oil w/ about 8 drops of lavender essential oil. Whatever is left over can be stored and reused. I massaged it in and let his scalp absorb it. Did not wash it off.

Like putting coconut oil on your face. Cause no one told me that was bad until 2 days ago when twitter went crazy.
7488 2018-01-28 22:21:33 @ChrisGPackham very thought provoking program, glad the girl was found, sad to see their situation tho, I didn’t know palm oil was in so much of our produce, why is it tho what is it’s purpose?

7493 2018-01-28 22:21:07 It made me want to vomit, something about a mouthful of oil 
7494 2018-01-28 22:20:47 I feel like it depends on your skin type and coconut oil is one of those oils that can either go right or wrong for your skin. I mean I was born in Fiji so I’ve had coconut oil used on me since I was outta the womb but honestly Naz you have flawless skin
7495 2018-01-28 22:20:45 He's deregulating banks & consumer protections.  Dropped charges against Deuschbank.  And, like Obama admin, isn't going to prosecute bank fraud or break up the mega banks.  He's deregulating oil & gas industry & opening public lands to the mega extractive industries.
7496 2018-01-28 22:20:40 Excuse me...but I work for a power generation corp and I doubt they would be planning for a solar future if it wasn't a pretty sure bet. Read a little about the power industry instead of just buying into propaganda the oil & gas lobbyists are selling you on Fox.
7497 2018-01-28 22:20:39 Before this degenerates into a slanging match and we block each other, can I ask you whether you agree with Effi Eitam, President of Genie Oil's Afek subsidiary in the illegally occupied Golan, and his view that Arabs are a "cancer" to be eradicated?
7498 2018-01-28 22:20:34 this humidity makes me have to use half a bottle of coconut oil on my hair so i always end up with my hair in a messy bun. i just wanna look cute, Texas 
7499 2018-01-28 22:20:28 Also the palm oil is a big no no for deforestation and pollution ;___; my heart breaks because I love nutella so much....
7500 2018-01-28 22:20:15 Clearly that person is an idiot, but you really shouldn't buy products with palm oil in them, since palm oil harvesting is directly contributing to the destruction of southeast asian rain forrest and the wholesale slaughter of orangutans.

7506 2018-01-28 22:19:08 I grieve for the loss of rainforest as a result of palm oil, not to mention the people and wildlife it has and continues to affect. As consumers we must make conscious efforts to boycott palm oil. I've started checking labels. This stuff is in EVERYTHING.
7507 2018-01-28 22:19:04 Because they use the oil they’ve used from the chicken and keep swapping it all until it turns black

7514 2018-01-28 22:18:16 @ChrisGPackham I found your programme very moving tonight. But also dreadfully disturbing to see what’s happening to these people because of palm oil. It’s a desperate situation

7516 2018-01-28 22:17:40 Direct to my cupboards to check for palm oil. My soap boasts the name. Otherwise ok. Then I get to the biscuit barrel  Is it possible to eat a biscuit ever again?
7517 2018-01-28 22:17:35 I've never personally tried it, but my dog had horrendous breath and my groomer said to start giving her 1 tsp coconut oil every other day. It cured her nasty breath in about a week!
7518 2018-01-28 22:17:19 Chris, unless we need to legislate against palm oil use. We live in a society fed by the cult of celebrity. What chance does the world have.

7523 2018-01-28 22:16:43 The first heating should produce enough energy to power a secondary burn. And actually about cars running on water.. I heard years ago someone did make an engine that did just that. It was ruled out because it would do away with the oil industry.

7533 2018-01-28 22:15:53 Coconut oil is a lie! It's comedogenic so it clogs your pores! And when you put it on your hair it doesn't add moisture it just seals it so in the long run it's not good.
7534 2018-01-28 22:15:41 Great sales pitch, Rick, but the rest of the world is way ahead of us on renewable energy. Leaders kissing up to oil barons is how we will become a third world nation.

7539 2018-01-28 22:14:42 I agree my man but that success with the Mets matters. It's not right but it does. 100% on board w/ the HOF deciding as they would almost always get it right.

7541 2018-01-28 22:14:17 China's oil buying problem = it's not a credit provider. 

No rule of law, no enforceable contracts, no jurisprudence (common law), no private property = China lacks credit infrastructure.
7542 2018-01-28 22:14:16 Corbyn is a snake oil salesman, promise anything to the gullible, they'll buy it. Once in power, oh I didn't mean that, total con artist. And people are stupid enough to believe him!!!!!
7543 2018-01-28 22:14:15 when you’re warm & comfy and don’t want to move but Austin wants to go to target to get beard oil 
7544 2018-01-28 22:14:11 Indeed. I’ve been boycotting products containing unsustainable palm oil for a couple of years but actually even so called sustainable sources could displace people and damage the environment. Chris is right...we are in a mess!
7545 2018-01-28 22:14:08 Ironic...want all the benefit of America's military...just not the oil drilling required to keep all the ship's components lubricated and planes fueled
7546 2018-01-28 22:14:07 That too, and red palm oil (not the trans fat), lard, tallow, goose fat.
I didn't mention coconut oil bc I don't like the taste.
For frying at high temperature I use ghee, lower temp. (scrambled eggs, fish) I use butter, for salads/dressings olive oil.
7547 2018-01-28 22:14:06 i literally don’t get paid until friday and i need my oil changed like, yesterday 
7548 2018-01-28 22:13:56 Wonna mix my shea butter and coconut oil.
But the coconut oil has refused to melt even inside cupboard .
Gotta put it in frying pan at this point
7549 2018-01-28 22:13:46 rainy day outsiiide, fuzzy socks ooon, green tea maade, book opened, now lemme just dab some soothing lavender essential oil on my templ-- it got in my EYE my MOthaFUckin EYE THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF CALMING
7550 2018-01-28 22:13:43 @ChrisGPackham a beautiful but extremely poignant programme.  What can we do to help? Simply stop buying palm oil products? I can & will do that, but how many need to do the same to make a difference?
7551 2018-01-28 22:13:40 Going 2 be filming some new clips for my onlyfans and premium snap chat! What would you like to see?

7552 2018-01-28 22:13:25 It is fine, he keeps being like, "i am sure there is no actual mint in that gum tho, are you allergic to the oil?" And i am annoyed.
7553 2018-01-28 22:13:23 If I goto a strip club, I’m going to throw Oil and scream Jesus.
7554 2018-01-28 22:13:17 palm oil and the indonesian political, economic and military establishments have a lot to answer for. We cannot even see what they are doing in #WestPapua
7555 2018-01-28 22:13:17 เป็นกำลังใจให้
7556 2018-01-28 22:13:13 i wonder if maybe the oil doesn't get quite hot enough in this little thing? i don't have a candy thermometer to check
7557 2018-01-28 22:13:12 These beautiful children will be visiting Aberdeen, the oil capital of Europe, and a must read!

The sheer scale of the disaster would not be eclipsed until the Exxon Valdez oil tanker disaster in 1989 & was a major reason for the creation of several key pieces of environmental legislation incl Clean Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act & creation of @EPA

7561 2018-01-28 22:12:48 We are planning on going through our kitchen tomorrow
looking for Palm Oil in the groceries.

Why do we need to consume so much of it??

Thoughtful programme,
Beautiful photographs.
#InSearchoftheLostGirl
7562 2018-01-28 22:12:47 SO WE HAVE ALL THIS OIL IN THE US, THEN WHY IS THE PRICES RISING? BUSH IN, OIL $100.00+ A BARREL, OBAMA IN, $35.00 A BARREL, TRUMP IN 1 YEAR, $65.00 AND CLIMBING. AND YOU'RE GOING TO TELL US IT'S NOT POLITICS!
7563 2018-01-28 22:12:34 @ChrisGPackham Enjoyed the documentary this evening. Important work. No more Palm Oil in my shopping from now on. #insearchofthelostgirl
7564 2018-01-28 22:12:32 Thank you @ChrisGPackham @BBCEarth for "In search of the lost girl". Bitter sweet memories of wonderful families I worked with in Borneo and the changes palm oil brought. Need to all work together to find solutions and fast
7565 2018-01-28 22:12:03 Apparently #GLAD flex trash bags can not be penetrated by trash.....but some how cooking oil shuffles it’s way thru the damn bag every time  #TrueStory #recycle
7566 2018-01-28 22:11:58 อยู่ไกลไปไม่ได้
7567 2018-01-28 22:11:56 Beautiful programme. Bought back the sadness and despair I felt driving through hours of palm oil plantations in northern Sumatra.
7568 2018-01-28 22:11:53 Rainforest is destroyed so we can put palm oil in 50% of the products we buy in the west
#insearchofthelostgirl
7569 2018-01-28 22:11:40 Patience young man... these things take time... do you invest regularly?  Nothing goes up continuously bud... price has to reset, find a higher base line support level and then increase again... happens with stocks, forex, crypto, gold, silver, oil etc. another spike will come
7570 2018-01-28 22:11:33 Carter's post-Expos numbers were a joke compared to his early days. He's just outside my era but I think the HOF should decide on your cap. It doesn't bother me he wanted to be a Met but it doesnt make overall sense
7571 2018-01-28 22:11:28 Excellent prog on BBC2 with Chris Packham tonight!  Frightening that forest land the size of 200 football pitches is given over every HOUR to growing Palm Oil..and indigenous people struggle to live their previous lives. Loss of environments which provided everything they needed!
7572 2018-01-28 22:11:20 30% tariff on clean Solar Power from China and 20% Washing Machines from  Korea, apparently America not really "Open for business." Solar Energy creates more jobs than Oil and Coal combined.
7573 2018-01-28 22:11:15 Searching for a one night stand, I cry for an hour and watch an oil rig fall over on the horizon
7574 2018-01-28 22:11:15 Wear a crystal amulet to sleep tonight. It's as good for you as oil pulling without taking the extra time.
7575 2018-01-28 22:11:15 places upon scientific advancement without the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill in modern American society? I argue is anonymous Twitter accounts are verification with the rest of

7577 2018-01-28 22:11:14 My gals got me an absolutely gorgeous essential oil diffuser (which was amazing because I got a set of oils from my housemate ) and in the cufuffle of tidying up i packed it with someone's stuff. Loooong 
7578 2018-01-28 22:11:14 Coconut oil doesn't do anything positive for my face. It causes me to break out even more.
7579 2018-01-28 22:10:56 I concede, climate change is a massive conspiracy and the only people we should believe are the oil companies that have no vested interest at all in disproving it.

I am embarrassed by how gullible I was.
7580 2018-01-28 22:10:46 สู้ๆครับ
7581 2018-01-28 22:10:44 Thank you for an amazing program. So many people don't know how destructive Palm oil is. Do you have a list of Palm oil free products? Would be great to know my toothpaste was Palm oil free. Thank you.
7582 2018-01-28 22:10:31 マテウスーマテウスー飲みにいこーぜー
7583 2018-01-28 22:10:30 (2/ ) 
Over a period of 10 days, an estimated 80-100k barrels of crude oil spilled into the Santa Barbara Channel waters, washing up on shore and killing thousands of sea birds, fish and other sea life, and marine animals including dolphins, sea lions, and seals.
7584 2018-01-28 22:10:26 It's now a bit of a both..part Hall and part player. Winfield was one but the Rays trying to pay Boggs to go in with their cap was the final straw :)
7585 2018-01-28 22:10:24 If it makes us energy power of the world. Drill. Here and anywhere else, that has oil. Get over youselfs oil is not a death sentance to tourist trade,  this is just more NWO, agenda, to make rest of the world. More powerfull. Then us!!! #MAGA #ReleseTheMemo
7586 2018-01-28 22:10:15 I accidentally put too much tea tree oil on my face and now it’s fucking burninggggggg
7587 2018-01-28 22:10:15 Oh nice! Yeah try it you’ll love it n you can even mix Castor oil n coconut it’s the best two combos ever.
7588 2018-01-28 22:10:15 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
7589 2018-01-28 22:10:05 avoid products with palm oil plz plz
7590 2018-01-28 22:09:54 A quick look at ingredients in various products around the house- I had no idea how much we rely on palm oil. Desperately sad. #ChrisPackham #insearchofthrlostgirl
7591 2018-01-28 22:09:44 @MayorLevine Saw ad & am extremely concerned you want to become governor! You will stop oil exploration, fine how many days a week are you parking your car & everyone in Florida? You want to be dependent on Middle East, right! We need to rid use of fossil fuel but not there yet!
7592 2018-01-28 22:09:42 I would eat all of those parts individually except the palm oil and that's kinda the mixing agent soooo
7593 2018-01-28 22:09:36 Wounds as part of a the physical world – it will do know what ironically what psychoanalysis terms of the end you need oil,
7594 2018-01-28 22:09:34 Turn it on sauté with some oil, sauté onions and peppers, throw in chicken, brown on each side for 1-2 min, toss in salsa and deglaze, then throw on high pressure for 7 min
7595 2018-01-28 22:09:04 America's oil exports are booming -- and lifting prices
7596 2018-01-28 22:08:57 My dog hardly eats his food anymore unless I put his gravy on it. And by gravy I mean olive oil. Because he had dry skin and now he's bougie and won't eat unless it's got olive oil. #lordhelpme
7597 2018-01-28 22:08:54 so many ppl complain about driving shitty cars but put six different kinds of oil in it and haven't changed replaced anything on it since they bought it lmfaoo
7598 2018-01-28 22:08:53 I’ve seen it all.. man put oil in the fridge 
7599 2018-01-28 22:08:48 Great program. What are your thoughts on 'sustainable' palm oil? Is there such a thing? Are the @RSPOtweets doing a any good?
7600 2018-01-28 22:08:36 Having to to remove a skid plate to change an oil filter is just a stupid design. @Toyota @ToyotaMotorCorp #sequoia
7601 2018-01-28 22:08:34 Odds and ends - complete spare dizzy, better Morris grille for the Traveller, paper oil filter housing. Nothing interesting.... 
7602 2018-01-28 22:08:32 By saying if you re tweet I will like everyone's comment
7603 2018-01-28 22:08:32 Mine is totally lo-carb. No bread crumbs at all! It's parmesan mixed with chopped parsley, basil, thyme & rosemary. Dredge flattened chicken strips in mix & fry in olive oil till golden, cook on wire rack on a sheet pan for 12 minutes at 350°
7604 2018-01-28 22:08:29 Great program tonight @ChrisGPackham Really important message about the destructive power of the palm oil industry. Big change is needed before the planet is ruined by human greed.
7605 2018-01-28 22:08:28 thats tha wave .. the cartridges .. cbd thc oil .. blowed real quick
7606 2018-01-28 22:08:27 What ingredients do you think products should use not to use palm oil?
Where would they be farmed?
#TooManyPeople
7607 2018-01-28 22:08:14 If there was ever more reason to boycott Palm Oil.  #deforestation #PalmOilFree
7608 2018-01-28 22:08:09 Try tea tree oil, savlon or something similar to ease symptoms until u can see dr
7609 2018-01-28 22:08:02 Agreed but Carter was one of the faces of the Mets during his time there and b/c they won, it matters. Though no question he and Dawson both had better years with the Expos.
7610 2018-01-28 22:07:56 Halleluyah! Grandma @Oracene have you tried @serenawilliams "Sweet Fries" for your Grand baby? Coconut Oil and Sweet Potatoes rock on the Lord's menu! Where is the honey dip?
#GodsBlackIce
7611 2018-01-28 22:07:53 Really important to report on palm oil and the deforestation of Sumatra in #insearchofthelostgirl. Well done @ChrisGPackham. But needed less on the lost girl and more on the industries who palm off palm oil to all of us here in the west.
7612 2018-01-28 22:07:46 Ryan if you rolled up next to any restaurant they great people of pittsburgh would park your car for free fill up your gas and change your oil for you. We love you shazier
7613 2018-01-28 22:07:44 @ChrisGPackham saddened & frustrated after watching your palm oil docu, I try my best to avoid it but it appears in so many products now, greed is at the core! Keep fighting! Never give up..! 
7614 2018-01-28 22:07:36 Start with 5 minutes.. the urge to swallow will put you in a panic.. I couldn't oil pull..
7615 2018-01-28 22:07:30 bruh some olive oil and pesto issa wrap
7616 2018-01-28 22:07:22 What a moving account by @ChrisGPackham #insearchofthelostgirl telling the story of deforestation in Sumatra to make way for oil palm and the changing way of life it has brought to a whole people. A thoughtful and important film.
7617 2018-01-28 22:07:15 Out of coconut oil, arms have begun to crack, fml.
7618 2018-01-28 22:07:13 This was beautiful. I shed a tear when the girl was found, what a miracle. The devastating impact palm oil has on the indigenous human and animal populations is a tragedy. What can we do to make a difference?
7619 2018-01-28 22:06:52 oh not not......oil
7620 2018-01-28 22:06:51 Guilty as hell 
People that voted for @realDonaldTrump got duped by a con man aka snake oil salesman
7621 2018-01-28 22:06:50 Yes, it seems to a some sort of Schrödinger oil. Quite mysterious.
7622 2018-01-28 22:06:47 Goal of the tax is not to make American solar panels more competitive but is instead to incentivise less people to invest in them. This is just another part of trumps plan of trying to revive coal and oil. Which will not succeed!
7623 2018-01-28 22:06:47 Watch A1f Red’s Hitchclock’s The Borgs, a robot adaptation of The Birds!

Coming Soon: Cyclo

You’ll never feel safe in an oil bath again!
7624 2018-01-28 22:06:44 @ChrisGPackham was very moved by the program "Search for the lost Girl". Other than cutting out Palm oil what else can be done, we would like to help in anyway?! Thanks.
7625 2018-01-28 22:06:43 Really good thought provoking content in this programme. Please advise though... what is the most ecological damage limiting oil that should/can be used instead of Palm oil? If Soy uses up more land to make, what are the best alternatives please?
7626 2018-01-28 22:06:35 Stopt using palm oil products long time ago.. thankyou for the programme Chris
7627 2018-01-28 22:06:31 Haven't seen so many people run to a Dakota since they struck oil in the Bakken
7628 2018-01-28 22:06:20 What can YOU do to help?

DO NOT buy anything that contains Palm Oil
7629 2018-01-28 22:06:06 You should stop bashing Bitcoin. This is bad for all crypto. Bitcoin has become what the USD is for oil. Respect it and enjoy your Bitcoin variant as well.
7630 2018-01-28 22:05:57 @ChrisGPackham brilliant show . How can we inform the public about the products that contain palm oil?
7631 2018-01-28 22:05:55 Gee sounds like a goid time to trash renewal energy... and make the Koch bros and Russian oil oligarchs even richer..
7632 2018-01-28 22:05:46 No one scared of anything. Kwani mnafikiri mna nini? People get sworn all over the world! You cannot force your tin god on us! We will meet there and square it out! #LiweLiwalo. The dead will be buried!
7633 2018-01-28 22:05:33 If only I had a friend that sold coconut oil so I could finally get some after weeks of trying @VikkiG_JA 
7634 2018-01-28 22:05:30 Mark, given that mct/coconut oil won’t spike insulin, then can it be used during IF with good effect? Cheers mate
7635 2018-01-28 22:05:27 Is anyone watching @ChrisGPackham ? What an amazing soul. Why isn’t it widely known that we consume so much palm oil across the world destroying rainforests and lives 
7636 2018-01-28 22:05:24 He might as well have an actual bucket of snake oil on his desk
7637 2018-01-28 22:05:22 Palm oil is also vegan but we cut down the palm trees that are home to orangutans and other rainforest creatures like elephants and tigers and rhinos, so really try not to buy palm oil
7638 2018-01-28 22:05:11 What a wonderful, thought provoking programme. What have we done to our amazing planet ? As you say, we really have messed up. Palm oil and plastics - we need to sort it out before it's too late.
7639 2018-01-28 22:05:11 The solar manufacturers depend on the cells from other countries which are not manufactured here. They will have to pay 30% tariff thus increasing costs to businesses and consumers.x this is intentionally designed to prefer oil and coal ceos.
7640 2018-01-28 22:05:04 Some countries (France) have banned Nutella with palm oil.  Nutella has over a dozen different recipes to deal with country specific laws.
7641 2018-01-28 22:04:52 So you're 11months older? I do get 35 from most everyone who guesses my age. I tell them it's the oil of ugly I use
7642 2018-01-28 22:04:48 Excellent programme but heartbreaking. Have been trying to cut out palm oil for some time. Thank you for shedding light on the hellish cycle those farmers are trapped in.
7643 2018-01-28 22:04:48 An area the equivalent size of 300 football fields of rainforest is cleared each hour to make way for palm oil production.

An estimated 1000-5000 orangutans are killed each year for this.
7644 2018-01-28 22:04:42 There's going to be Palm oil complaints left right and centre thanks to Chris Packham's documentary. I understand his view but didn't go into the details of sustainable vs unsustainable.
7645 2018-01-28 22:04:23 The headline on this story and the tweet are very misleading given the text of the story which states:

“Technically, the gas shipment does not appear to violate the prohibitions...”, and;
“Russian oil and gas shipments are not subject to U.S. sanctions”

You should reword it.
7646 2018-01-28 22:04:17 She’s just having her guilt tripping moment of glory, I saw a similar post mentioning the oil in pizza so it’s just ppl being preachy n annoying
7647 2018-01-28 22:04:17 Without a doubt, one of Chris’s most powerful pieces of work. Thank you for the passion, insight and the message about the devastation of palm oil farming.
7648 2018-01-28 22:04:07 “Our consumption is destroying ecosystems across the world” incredibly moving documentary from @ChrisGPackham on Indonesia and Palm Oil 
7649 2018-01-28 22:04:06 Bronfman and the Expos fucked with The Hawk, as they did Raines, so if either of them balked bcos of it, I would have been fine. It only really made sense for Dawson tho ie MVP as a Cub
7650 2018-01-28 22:03:50 I use sesame oil. Like it a little better. It does work.
7651 2018-01-28 22:03:43 Test Shell company had an oil accident
7652 2018-01-28 22:03:41 100% and for both of those guys, it was due to extra $$$ they could earn. With that said, the argument could be made for Carter & Dawson as well but IMO, the gap was much clearer between those two compared to Guerrero.
7653 2018-01-28 22:03:40 #GOPTaxScam $1.5 Trillion tax scam 6,000 lobbyists lawyer's wrote it, those where pen scribbling in the margin's, that who passed copy's out to senators 20 minutes before the vote. Koch brother's daddy built oil, chemical refineries for Nazi's.
7654 2018-01-28 22:03:30 The price of oil will plummet when #indyref2 is called and god help us when we vote YES. The oil will run out, we'll have no electricity, gas, heating, water and we'll all be bankrupt in a fortnight!! :-)
7655 2018-01-28 22:03:28 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
7656 2018-01-28 22:03:22 You're actually arguing against science. Let me know when you have stats you can back, not based on research funded by the oil industry. Sorry but I'm not wasting my time on this one. Have a nice day.

7661 2018-01-28 22:03:10 Sure… there is no flexibility with #SB827. And having worked with another corrupt industry (Oil & Gas), once you deregulate, they will take advantage of every loophole, and then they will go back for even more deregulation.
7662 2018-01-28 22:03:01 put some tea tree oil on them! they will go away in a day or so
7663 2018-01-28 22:03:01 #LostGirl superb work @ChrisGPackham well done, another reason I refuse to buy palm oil products
7664 2018-01-28 22:02:57 yes i put coconut oil in my hair twice a week
7665 2018-01-28 22:02:54 They are delish roasted in the oven and tossed in olive oil, salt flakes and garlic.
7666 2018-01-28 22:02:40 Fantastic to see you raising the issue of palm oil production.
7667 2018-01-28 22:02:30 Is that the same oil that would be completely useless to an independent Scotland?

7671 2018-01-28 22:02:21 @ChrisGPackham WoW totally enjoyed watching The Search for Lost Girl. No more palm oil in this house
7672 2018-01-28 22:02:19 Me too but get disheartened when no-one else cares about the consequences from the products they buy so palm oil demand continues.
7673 2018-01-28 22:02:02 Oregano oil has 3 to 20x more antioxidants than any other fruit, vegetable or herb! Source: US Dept. of Ag. WOW!!
7674 2018-01-28 22:01:54 Yeah coconut is a no no. I use bergamot oil & tea tree oil. But there’s soooo many lol I recommend doing some research when it comes to what’s best for you and your skin.
7675 2018-01-28 22:01:43 why do I overuse olbas oil so much, laid in bed with tears pouring down my face an my eyes burning like crazy
7676 2018-01-28 22:01:34 Yeah Elle - Simplz - Can of ChickPeas, few cloves of Garlic, Tablespoon Tahini Paste, Virgin Olive Oil, Salt & Pepper and blend to smooth consistency. Tahini Paste is the playmaker
7677 2018-01-28 22:01:09 So make your own with coconut oil and maybe unprocessed sugar... It shouldn't be a surprise that these are the ingredients tho.
7678 2018-01-28 22:00:43 January 28, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

7681 2018-01-28 22:00:25 Well it is oil money. And people have a good reason to say what they do, ManCity don’t get paid for any players they just spend spend spend. Who cares what others think though?

7685 2018-01-28 22:00:19 It was first (and still is) about the Rostnef Oil deal and money laundering; then subsequently about Obstruction of Justice and Conspiracy Against The United States.  #TrumpRussia

7690 2018-01-28 22:00:03 They are terrifying and its what we're most at risk of here (well, that and drought). Eucalyptus trees are not only full of oil, but they actually need fire to reproduce.
7691 2018-01-28 21:59:57 OMG HE FOUND HER... MY HEART!

This is too emotional... This is such a happy but tragic story. Her whole family were murdered and her home was destroyed... And now she's living under palm oil trees... Such a tragic full circle #SearchForTheLostGirl
7692 2018-01-28 21:59:55 I do it all the time with sesame seed oil and it's amazing. My gums don't bleed ever anymore and my teeth look great and my breath is always nice.
7693 2018-01-28 21:59:54 Palm oil  - so destructive. What have we done?
7694 2018-01-28 21:59:50 I'm an Expos fan ,but most seem to forget both Carter and Dawson wanted to go in as a Met and Cub respectively but the HOF said no. Only Raines truly wanted to go In as an Expo.
7695 2018-01-28 21:59:37 How would we have stable power supply when the richest man and woman in Africa  and most rich people in Nigeria are Oil investors and importers of generators? We ‘be been deprived of good living for too long. Ordinary light. Nawa o

7699 2018-01-28 21:59:16 I have a similar uchafu about Raila!
7700 2018-01-28 21:59:14 It's a well known fact having oil not only makes you poor but undermines your society too, Scotland, Libya, Iraq to name but a few - thank you WM for taking this burden off us so our country isn't reduced to smoking rubble. #YouYesYet
7701 2018-01-28 21:59:08 Abeg pour oil inside the lock #BBNaija 
7702 2018-01-28 21:58:57 “They’re not intellectual people” Yeah he needs those people everyday to change his oil, protect him from the social predators, save him from fires,...etc. He’s just pissed at the world his degree in women studies isn’t paying back
7703 2018-01-28 21:58:52 i put cocnut oil into my hair and let it soak for 20mins and this is the best thing that has ever happened to them
7704 2018-01-28 21:58:51 I'll be on the way back home from Florida.Back to the frozen toundra of Canada,so will miss the announcement but will catch up in the evening.Looking forward to it.GoJA!!!!!
7705 2018-01-28 21:58:46 Deregulation by the Republican Party led to economic bubbles and incidents; housing market, oil spills like the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico, etc... It’s nice that you think low taxes and deregulation will bring businesses back but it will be our downfall. #GOPTaxScam
7706 2018-01-28 21:58:38 why should he answer a question that everyone that is paying attention already knows the answer too?  Yes.  Yes he will.  and before long oil derricks will be all over Yellowstone and Yosemite.
7707 2018-01-28 21:58:35 Amazing what can be done when you accept science. China is spending 360 billion dollars on renewable energy projects resulting in millions of jobs. Trump is bringing back coal jobs ? Opening up our national parks for increased oil drilling and mining !
7708 2018-01-28 21:58:16 Just rubbed potatoes in Olive oil and coarse salt and my hands are soft as hell. I wonder what’s on the outside of my potatoes now 
7709 2018-01-28 21:58:14 Sadly I seem to have been signing petitions against palm oil cultivation and rainforest destruction for years but #insearchofthelostgirl reinforces that it is as destructive as ever.

Angel 2: a million tiny holes that leak oil and bubble up when they get clogged

7712 2018-01-28 21:57:26 Try lemon grass powder mixed in a shot glass with water, switch for 3 to 5 minutes. Works better then oil pulling, takes less time and taste a lot better.
7713 2018-01-28 21:57:02 @ChrisGPackham we need to start an anti palm oil campaign. Count me in. Awesome you found the girl!
7714 2018-01-28 21:57:01 The bottomless pit isn't there anymore #UCP. It's a new era and voter's in AB. We dont want the oil execs in YYC to be coddled anymore.
7715 2018-01-28 21:56:59 You could've called me,  you for chop am with groundnut oil and Maggi, plus yaji
7716 2018-01-28 21:56:47 Sesame seed oil tastes better and is easier.
7717 2018-01-28 21:56:31 Coconut oil for teeth whitening
7718 2018-01-28 21:56:06 This lemon oil thing became very famous during chennai floods.Used to get rid of the nasty smell in those houses got flooded..
7719 2018-01-28 21:55:50 I will say palm oil is extremely gross to me and one of those products people boycott. Nutella is probably the least offensive use of it to me but I hate when it’s in chocolate and cookies for no good reason. Disgusting waxy stuff.
7720 2018-01-28 21:55:47 Exactly. For all his faults Salmond understands the oil industry which is why he rarely mentions it now.
7721 2018-01-28 21:55:46 Switching soaps can help, too. Soaps with sulfates (foaming ingredient) can be drying. @CalgaryCoop & @myCNF carry a really good local soap that’s fairly inexpensive, made out of olive oil.
7722 2018-01-28 21:55:45 could it be oil and gas related over permit battles & land rights fights
7723 2018-01-28 21:55:40 I been hearing coconut oil is just a sealant. You know any butters or oils that can be used to moisturize?
7724 2018-01-28 21:55:36 Watching #insearchofthelostgirl How did palm oil get so prevalent in our lives??! I never realised the level of destruction it has caused.
7725 2018-01-28 21:55:26 Fake news! Conservatives also want to give tax breaks, reduce regulations, get more coal and oil, break up unions, kill more terrorists - and when compared to Pelosi this is a great plan. Prove it wrong in one tweet or log off forever!
7726 2018-01-28 21:55:18 I ain’t never heard of making a appointment for a oil change wtf
7727 2018-01-28 21:55:17 Yes, have also done it with sesame seed oil.
7728 2018-01-28 21:55:15 “..targets free radicals and harmful toxins, green tea absorbs impurities within the skin that could potentially induce breakouts. This mask also stimulates the flow of oxygen and blood to the face, helps unclog dirt and excess oil from pores..”
7729 2018-01-28 21:54:59 Imagine going to check your oil then BOOM your mechanic stole your dipstick
7730 2018-01-28 21:54:58 Is it ignorant to say coconut oil is made for black people? I don't kno... 

All in saying is, I've never found it OUTSIDE a black household. Not even in stores. Its just sumn you're born with, I think.
7731 2018-01-28 21:54:43 Oil Change finished on my Subaru, hopefully it will love me after abusing it during these cold winter months
7732 2018-01-28 21:54:39 Physicians formula dewy argan oil with the glitter in it. It was $15 and the specks of glitter are annoying and they don’t make my face look dewy at all. I looked super sweaty and oily. I could have returned it but my dumb self kept it

7735 2018-01-28 21:54:17 @Bethenny what kind of coconut oil did you get?
7736 2018-01-28 21:54:16 ah not yet unfortunately :o just have coconut oil in my hair
7737 2018-01-28 21:54:06 I’d love to atleast try to reap some of the benefits of coconut oil, most make it seem like a miracle cure, that is if you aren’t allergic to it like me 
7738 2018-01-28 21:53:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.
7739 2018-01-28 21:53:51 Probably just an inch or 2 my hair is like 2 inches below my shoulders so I can’t really cut much off lol but I’m definitely gonna try coconut oil I haven’t gotten any of it yet, just castor oil, rosemary oil, and tea tree oil

7742 2018-01-28 21:53:37 Just catching up on all the backlash from Vladimir Guerrero's decision to go into the Hall wearing an Angels cap. I get the disappointment and agree the Expos cap would've been a slightly better choice. That said, the player earned this privilege.
7743 2018-01-28 21:53:35 That guy who drives a tiny electric Fiat to an auto parts store to drop off 6 gallons of spent motor oil? Yes, I am that guy.
7744 2018-01-28 21:53:32 Anyone that had govt peanut butter knows you gotta add oil to make it smooth.
7745 2018-01-28 21:53:17 not at all.. My skin and hair is made different than yours. Coconut oil strengthens black hair and skin, and is widely used for black people. I was just giving insight to the differences of the consumer...
7746 2018-01-28 21:53:10 Wen am angry i drink my tea wit acid nd palm oil
7747 2018-01-28 21:53:02 Dear @ChrisGPackham great programme so far. How can we pressure our govt to remove palm oil products? Lets do something big.
7748 2018-01-28 21:52:53 any particular brand of coconut oil you could recommend??
7749 2018-01-28 21:52:49 You can bring the coconut oil blended coffee
7750 2018-01-28 21:52:45 @Nick_Offerman preferred way of giving some TLC to used wood furniture? A specific oil perhaps? Figured it better to ask you than to google it! Any advice is greatly appreciated!
7751 2018-01-28 21:52:43 Those shiny rings of oil like all the stars in the milky way
7752 2018-01-28 21:52:42 A siberian tweeted before @scotgov needs to ask oil producers to "donate" $1 pb to Scottish fund .
7753 2018-01-28 21:52:33 Peppermint oil!
7754 2018-01-28 21:52:31 Oh girl. I dated a nigga in the early 2000s who wore that fucking oil. Omg. He left that shit in my fucking mattress it was so strong. Always called me Queen.
7755 2018-01-28 21:52:28 Trump's wired to take the oil.
7756 2018-01-28 21:52:16 Be careful it will spray oil everywhere ;)
7757 2018-01-28 21:52:16 i see y’all getting woke on coconut oil being bad for your skin so lemme also weigh in and say you need to drop anyone saying coconut oil is healthier for you to eat. shit clogs your arteries just as bad as olive oil or vegetable oil or any other saturated fat
7758 2018-01-28 21:52:15 He does not force the students into his lectures! Useless Al Shabaab!
7759 2018-01-28 21:52:11 Great programme on BBC2 right now. How can we challenge demand for palm oil, @ChrisGPackham ? It's in almost everything the supermarkets sell. Some products claim to contain sustainable palm oil. Really? A disaster for natural! @CraigBennett3 @greennomad61 @Team4Nature300 @TiCLme
7760 2018-01-28 21:52:10 olive oil for my hair is a fkn life saver
7761 2018-01-28 21:52:07 Surely there's a solution to this horrendous Palm Oil destruction in Indonesia #insearchofthelostgirl
7762 2018-01-28 21:52:05 Is anyone watching BBC 2 and Chris Packham's programme on the Lost Tribe? Filmed in Sumatra where the rain forest is being destroyed at an alarming rate to produce palm oil.
7763 2018-01-28 21:52:00 So allow Congress to pass laws to allow using our own reserves of oil instead of vetoing them #ERMSLegSim
7764 2018-01-28 21:51:59 LOL: Bettman: "Maybe it be that the Olympics bid might fail because there is not a new arena" Olympics: The Saddledome is perfectly fine for another olympics. Lie to me more you snake oil sales prick. #NHLAllStar
7765 2018-01-28 21:51:57 I thought I was alone in the office so I was singing out loud... I wasn't alone. One of the guys comes out of no where and says I have a voice as smooth as olive oil. Embarrassed, yes. Slightly confused with the compliment, also yes
7766 2018-01-28 21:51:56 Saved from #45’s policies and executive orders! His favoritism of corporations over individuals, his desire to allow oil drilling off the CA coast, his destruction of the environment in general, #KeystoneXLpipeline as an example, and his new tax code.
7767 2018-01-28 21:51:52 Have you ever done coconut oil pulling? You swish in your mouth for 20 mins & it removes toxins. Trying for the 1st time. Not as easy as it sounds.
7768 2018-01-28 21:51:46 @pepboysauto lmk if i’m wrong.. but I’m pretty sure your stores aren’t suppose to randomly ‘test drive’ expensive cars after oil changes. Pissed that one of your stores basically stole my car for about 5-10 minutes without informing me.
7769 2018-01-28 21:51:46 Encouraging to see stabilizing oil prices and private equity backfilling some of the declining O&G investment in the North Sea.
7770 2018-01-28 21:51:28 What I realized is that you got to get your hair used to one oil at the time. Sometimes we got to take risks lol you will regret it at first but get used to it and once it grows back healthy it’ll be worth it. You planning on cutting hella hair? Or just an inch or two?
7771 2018-01-28 21:51:17 i PUT TEA TREE OIL AND THEN I PUT SHEA BUTTER AND I FUCKING CLEANSE AND THEN I TRY HYDRATING. MASKS AND TRIED EVERY MOISTURIZER KNOWN TO WOMEN KIND
7772 2018-01-28 21:51:15 Budget day & no Tupperware. Carve out the excess bread from inside rolls. Then, stuff with tossed veggies & avo for a lowcarb sandwich. Keep oil separate or toss in mix. Discount breads work for this, paper bag it. #sandwich #lowcarb
7773 2018-01-28 21:51:04 mysterious curse/illness that’s turned his hand the color and shine of oil and is slowly creeping up his arm perhaps
7774 2018-01-28 21:50:48 But we do have vegan options! Our churros are vegan but they are cooked in oil that may contain traces of egg. But you can enjoy our Dark Couverture Hot Chocolate made with soy or almond milk, Strawberry Bowl with dark choc dip & Mango Sorbet are a few options
7775 2018-01-28 21:50:34 Tea, eucalyptus oil, broth, and good old fashioned rest really helped me.  Oh, and I did take one ibuprofen for my awful headache on Friday.
7776 2018-01-28 21:50:26 I need you to obtain me some castor oil and jojoba.
7777 2018-01-28 21:50:22 i think i might’ve got some coconut oil in my eyes

7783 2018-01-28 21:50:03 Oil production in the USA is close to 10M barrels a day, we now export oil & aren't dependant on anyone for oil. So #dumptrump plan for off-shore drilling isn't needed nor is his killing the clear air act valid. No matter what he says we don't need or want dirty old coal. Moron
7784 2018-01-28 21:49:39 I drink camomile a lot! And always use lavender oil diffusers but haven't tried lemon balm xo
7785 2018-01-28 21:49:35 Coconut oil isn't the answer to all problems contrary to popular belief.
7786 2018-01-28 21:49:35 Night night. I find eucalyptus oil helps too

7793 2018-01-28 21:48:15 the coolest thing that always happens is when my car reminds me i need an oil change only when i’m broke
7794 2018-01-28 21:48:05 Ok, I’ll give them all a try. I have cooked with olive oil but never the other two. I’ll see which ones I like the best. Why do you prefer Avocado oil?

7798 2018-01-28 21:47:38 What is the solution to the palm oil problem? #insearchofthelostgirl
7799 2018-01-28 21:47:25 the oil she suggests we put in them, yes.

7802 2018-01-28 21:47:01 Shower, coconut oil, bong rip & an everything bagel with cream cheese/avocado.
7803 2018-01-28 21:46:53 I hope this isn’t the result of a “wonder if rats will shower like humans if” experiment in which  subjects were given a choice: live covered in motor oil or sower like a human. Cute though!
7804 2018-01-28 21:46:47 Health Tips: keep your omega 3 oils(incl. fish oils)  in the freezer to keep fresh and reduce the fish oil repeating on you.
7805 2018-01-28 21:46:41 Just trim the tips & add coconut oil. It works wonders lol I cut my hair hella shirt two years ago and I was regretting it. But thankfully it grew fast and now I’m just trimming the tips and adding coconut oil, and not use any heat on my hair, like curling irons or straighteners
7806 2018-01-28 21:46:14 The Koch brothers provide more than 600,000 jobs for Americans. They have 12 different business ventures through out. Not just oil. Trumps dereg. in the energy sector is creating jobs as we speak and will make this country energy independent of all countries including Russia.
7807 2018-01-28 21:46:08 You have to put it in your hair like deadass the night before and it hasss to be  shampooed our twice at least. I think Argan oil is the best for hair after you still it but warming up the coconut oil in ur hands before you apply it helps it not feel/look as greasy
7808 2018-01-28 21:45:43 It broke up an DIDNT have any Coverage at all, and it made me look lile an oil slick
7809 2018-01-28 21:45:28 Orang Rimba translates to forest person in Bahasa Indonesian. This program was neither focused on the degredation of Indigenous peoples land or the widespread deforestation carried out by the palm oil industry. Finding a ‘tribal girl’, why?

いえいえ
こちらこそです！
7811 2018-01-28 21:45:26 YOU PUT SO MUCH OIL IN THE DAMN PANCAKES
7812 2018-01-28 21:45:23 (وما كان لنفس أن تموت إلا بإذن الله كتابا مؤجلا ومن يرد ثواب الدنيا نؤته منها ومن يرد ثواب الآخرة نؤته منها وسنجزي الشاكرين) [آل عمران:145] oil
7813 2018-01-28 21:45:14 You are brain dead!
7814 2018-01-28 21:45:10 "Whats the tissue for?"

"Palm oil"
7815 2018-01-28 21:45:06 Lavender or lemongrass oil can help I think? X or it's docs  x
7816 2018-01-28 21:45:05 I just made eggs over easy with whole grain toast with sliced avocado on top with an olive oil drizzle, topped off with black pepper and a glass of almond milk. Wife me?
7817 2018-01-28 21:44:42 I know how to change my own car oil now. What’s good hoes
7818 2018-01-28 21:44:23 Love to take my car for an oil change and have them tell me that I need to get my tires replaced.

I KNOW they're bald, Gary. You think I haven't been spinning out at every stop sign when it's even slightly snowy?

Anyway, I hope my taxes go well, cause that's $400 gone.
7819 2018-01-28 21:44:18 Promised not to send oil to North Korea. That worked real well.
7820 2018-01-28 21:44:17 Search apps for palm oil and you can get a handy Shopping guide. Nutella is rated excellent for sustainable palm oil sourcing
7821 2018-01-28 21:44:13 @ChrisGPackham show on BBC2 right now. The palm oil industry is SO AWFUL! So much deforestation 
7822 2018-01-28 21:44:07 The climate impact of gas in the USA must be analyzed now on a state-by-state basis. Where coal still provides substantial generation (33 states) gas is helpful. But in 17 states where coal nearly gone, gas and oil now are climate problems.
7823 2018-01-28 21:44:04 If you do that, followed by towel drying and applying beard oil, you’ll really be amazed at not only how soft your beard will be, but also how healthy it is.
7824 2018-01-28 21:44:03 That girl and fashion sense are like oil and water
7825 2018-01-28 21:43:57 And as much as I would LOVE turning back the clock and defeating oil companies a century ago and building a city around public transit, the fact is that L.A. was build around the car and is not building enough public transit now. Low income folks have cars too.
7826 2018-01-28 21:43:43 Also, Nigeria is the fifth largest producer of crude oil and one of the highest importer of PMS. We'be been cursed.

7832 2018-01-28 21:43:09 Somebody asked the CEO of a major oil firm why he employed so many Greats graduates. He replied, “Because they sell more oil”.

7835 2018-01-28 21:42:55 HE IS NOT NORMAL.
Trump is a turn off now.
His base is big oil, Whacko conspiracyists and less and less every speech.
I refuse to watch his phoney tratorous face fake out
the country that he has done all good.
I'm betting he will repeat something and you can guarantee it's a lie.

7839 2018-01-28 21:42:41 East Africans experts have been pretty busy recently studying Brazilian Varzeeja drainage which freed for agriculture a land mass equivalent to Austria. South Sudanese see themselves as ranchers beyond the oil area which won't last another 15 years.
7840 2018-01-28 21:42:36 Neal signing with the oil
7841 2018-01-28 21:42:11 Screams, "Nutella has an excellent sustainability rating for palm oil and Ferrero is a member of the RSPO! " but yeah duh it's sugary
7842 2018-01-28 21:42:09 You are not so far off. Another word for tripes is gras-double (double fat). Far better than palm oil. And more "paleo" ;)
7843 2018-01-28 21:42:04 2. Baby oil is permitted on shabbos
7844 2018-01-28 21:41:37 Olive oil

7847 2018-01-28 21:41:25 We basically HAVE TO shift the oil tanker that is Labour, as it's not going to go away, and it's better for the Many than being on the sinking gin palace that is Flagship Tory. We have to start where we are. Greening Labour and Labouring Greens. Wisdom and compassionate action.

7849 2018-01-28 21:40:59 I wanted to be lazy today but i guess i should be responsible and finally get my car's oil changed 
7850 2018-01-28 21:40:58 lol, thats because coconut oil is for black hair and skin
7851 2018-01-28 21:40:55 when my family ask for some oil imake them a coo lil bottle of the best oil at purest form for hair growth & skin
7852 2018-01-28 21:40:50 Roasted brussels sprouts, yo.  Trim off the bottom, cut 'em in half, toss in olive oil, salt & pepper, throw 'em in the oven on 400 for about 30-40 minutes (redistribute them once in a while), shake some parmesan cheese on them in the last 10 minutes or so...fuckin' legit.
7853 2018-01-28 21:40:28 Wait, let me get this straight. The anti-cyclist media (regardless of which channel...) are being backed by big oil companies and are using our Storm to advocate a cull of cyclists? How did I not notice this before!?!
7854 2018-01-28 21:40:28 I was frying fish and spilled some oil on some pants (only got to wear one time)....yo I got the oil stain out and I’m rejoicing right now.
7855 2018-01-28 21:40:23 Some girl went on a whole twitter rant about how coconut oil shouldn't be used on your skin but ain't offer one tip. People love to tell you you're wrong but won't do shit to help you get on the right path.
7856 2018-01-28 21:40:23 Certain flavor/smell combinations are magical. There has to be some math/set theory somewhere that describes it.

Chicken, lemon, rosemary and olive oil are one set.

7860 2018-01-28 21:40:12 What would it take to get that kid on the Oil 
7861 2018-01-28 21:40:08 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
7862 2018-01-28 21:40:05 I can think, and I don’t like what I am seeing!Trump has helped the rich, stopped regulation on banks, oil field drilling, completely running natural resources!  Democrat have lost there minds! They all need to be gone! This is not a good time in history!
7863 2018-01-28 21:40:02 Watching @ChrisGPackham’s ‘In Search of the Lost Girl’ on @BBCTwo. Some truly staggering and shocking statistics on the deforestation of rainforest in Indonesia due to the worlds appetite for palm oil. #environment
7864 2018-01-28 21:40:01 I only understand how u feel by 10% but I know it really sucks and I’m sorry people are being assholes to u 

do u put pure coconut oil in ur hair? It’s been helping me lately
7865 2018-01-28 21:39:58 For the first time in 45 years, non-oil sector is to generate more income than oil sector.

7866 2018-01-28 21:39:50 No what happened in Iraq is in #Kirkuk where oil is there was never in the history a Kurd majority.Kirkuk was a Turkish/Arabic majority city. Barzani used #US presence to change the population  to steal Kirkuk and its oil using freedom story to get western people's support like u
7867 2018-01-28 21:39:49 Someone just said they should put palm oil inside the padlocks #bbnaija
7868 2018-01-28 21:39:48 He zeph will you reply to this comment
7869 2018-01-28 21:39:40 the deterioration of my managers asked me at work today and i would rather boil myself in oil than do that
7870 2018-01-28 21:39:38 @ChrisGPackham thanks for highlighting #palmoil #insearchoflostgirl #boycott #palmoil have you switched to #sustainable palm oil yet? @waitrose @sainsburys @Tesco @asda @Morrisons @AldiUK @LidlUK @coopuk @CadburyUK
7871 2018-01-28 21:39:29 Im calling those things "palm oil" from now on. 
7872 2018-01-28 21:39:29 Raising awareness about the continous degredation of land to make way for palm oil plantations is very important but following @ChrisGPackham on a personal search to find a ‘tribal girl’ is not.
7873 2018-01-28 21:39:23 Palm oil will kill una there... Nor do open padlock una go soon go house #BBNaija
7874 2018-01-28 21:39:21 Does anyone like $DLTA now that oil is over $66?  Check it's 5yr pps chart.  3 yrs ago when oil was $66 it absolutely exploded..
7875 2018-01-28 21:39:17 Oh no.. hope you will post it anyway  how can you compare removing makeup with micelar water (ex.Garnier) vs cleansing oil/balm? Does oil make huge difference? Never tried them before..
7876 2018-01-28 21:39:04 How on earth could Scotland cope with its own oil! It's too small! It's around 400 000 inhabitant smaller than Denmark and Norway! They'll never cope! Better stay with UK and increase their debts! #indyref2 now
7877 2018-01-28 21:39:00 Lol
7878 2018-01-28 21:38:42 It amazes me that man still lives a nomadic lifestyle isolated from modern society completely independently and there’s another man in a suit that wants to end their civilisation to produce palm oil- how sustainable actually is “sustainable palm oil” to indigenous Forrest tribes?
7879 2018-01-28 21:38:18 I swear by essential oils! I don’t think I would ever put straight coconut oil on because it is so thick but mixed with the essential oils I love! I put it in at night before bed and my fave hasn’t had a (bad) break out in a while!!
7880 2018-01-28 21:38:14 Also OI of ~1100 for contracts of something as big as btc is so incredibly small and insignificant. That many contracts are traded in seconds for oil
7881 2018-01-28 21:38:09 We are now the number one producer of oil in the world! We are no longer dependent  on foreign oil! Wonder who they will sell it to now?
7882 2018-01-28 21:38:07 The recipe: toss a cut up head of cauliflower, one onion sliced, and some unpeeled garlic cloves w/salt, pepper, fresh thyme sprigs, olive oil. Bake at 425F on a cookie sheet for 30mins. Sprinkle some Parmesan, bake 10 more minutes. Yum.
7883 2018-01-28 21:38:02 A la gente le gustan mis pecas, pero éstas realmente no son pecas (no nací con ellas). Son el resultado de un "bad-practice" de bronceado con baby oil de hace años 
7884 2018-01-28 21:37:56 I’m watching @ChrisGPackham In Search of the Lost Girl and shocked that half of ALL products in supermarkets contain palm oil! I want to change my buying habits - anyone know of products which don’t contain it? Or any resources on this? #palmoil #chrispackham
7885 2018-01-28 21:37:53 Oil change with free brake inspection and tire rotation
7886 2018-01-28 21:37:41 Even if the cobalt does not come directly from the mines with child labour, the demand for the price and thus the profit of the warlords increases. It's the same with oil, unfortunately.
7887 2018-01-28 21:37:31 From 2008-2017, it was hard to make a case that "fracking" or at least shale gas did not cut emissions in US. Gas generally replaced coal and heating oil.
7888 2018-01-28 21:37:23 Like last part of article. Indeed, oil producers need to proactively defend their market share in the future. Beyond the cut, I reckon we will see discounts from Iran and Russia. Middle Eastern producers, if manage their national accounts well, can still dominate. Low breakevens.
7889 2018-01-28 21:37:16 No true. Also most of the land used for meat won't grow crops. I've never known palm oil used for frying
7890 2018-01-28 21:37:07 - you’re adorable, and your beard deserves countless women massaging beard oil into it.
7891 2018-01-28 21:37:02 @ManchesterArena Great show but ice cream in plastic tub, two plastic spoons and I really hope the palm oil was sustainable? #plasticpollution @RSPOtweets
7892 2018-01-28 21:36:55 .@feliperacing81 "My steering wheel was like a Christmas tree with water temperature and oil temperature gauges lighting up." #Rolex24Hours
7893 2018-01-28 21:36:51 Why the hell do they put in skim milk? As if that makes that oil and sugar pile healthy? Skim milk is such a scam imho. Yuck.
7894 2018-01-28 21:36:49 I really do think the CBD oil has been helping me. 
Just need more flavors now.
7895 2018-01-28 21:36:39 @FoxNews Iraq can produce 2 billion barrels of oil per year. If we give anybody money it should be a loan with collateral. Don't enable.
7896 2018-01-28 21:36:35 I'm legit missing 5 "oil slick" Brotman and Short LPs. Have the rest of the special edition stuff for them but those LPs are nowhere to be found. Record came out in 2013.
7897 2018-01-28 21:36:29 I remember when this was all Oil of Ulay.
7898 2018-01-28 21:36:19 It is the confidence in the economy that is making all the numbers better! After eight years under a failed Obama economy sanctions against coal and oil production as well as drilling hurt our economy! When Trump took office he reversed all of the Obama restrictions! Thanks DJT!
7899 2018-01-28 21:36:14 Oh girl my dandruff is always so bad I go back and forth between tea tree oil shampoo to head and shoulders and it’s still there 
7900 2018-01-28 21:36:07 Good job girl!! Keep it up  Bio oil also works amazing for stretch marks, i used that everyday when i was pregnant with Aliyah and i had no stretch marks & the ones I already had disappeared
7901 2018-01-28 21:35:32 @LaBeautyologist how do you feel about using Vitamin E oil?
7902 2018-01-28 21:35:22 Truth oils are great moisturizers too. It really depends on the skin type, what I meant is slathering oil on your face could promote breakouts if you already have oily skin
7903 2018-01-28 21:35:18 The Koch’s father sold oil refining processes/equipment to the Nazis. Am I right, @JaneMayerNYer

7906 2018-01-28 21:34:53 Friends : “Aw Derricka you’re glowing you must be so happy.”
Me : “It’s coconut oil.”
7907 2018-01-28 21:34:45 200 football pitches of rainforest are cut down every HOUR to feed the western worlds obsession with #PalmOil something needs to be done. Thank you @BBCTwo for the recent documentaries mentioning the crisis. Stop supporting palm oil.
7908 2018-01-28 21:34:41 she doesnt like vegetable oil i think she is confusing it with like.  motor oil idek
7909 2018-01-28 21:34:40 Yeah I think that’s part of it. My scalp dries quickly and as a result becomes quite itchy. I do have some oil I can use for it.
7910 2018-01-28 21:34:29 It was surprisingly okay. They promote the faba water quite a bit, but there is also quite a bit of coconut oil in it. There's more to it than how it's marketed.
7911 2018-01-28 21:34:24 Give them oil to apply on that padlock.. #BBNaija
7912 2018-01-28 21:34:09 From what you are saying about palm oil and Sumatra, no wonder the orangs of that area, for example, are under threat.
7913 2018-01-28 21:34:09 Seems obvious to me there's a right-wing coup going on down in England, and they will try to kill off the Scottish parliament in order to control our oil.
7914 2018-01-28 21:34:04 Ya grn ne?
7915 2018-01-28 21:33:59 Y’all only like dark skin niggas when they got a six pack and oil on they chest
7916 2018-01-28 21:33:55 I first went to Sumatra in 1995 and rubber and oil palm were already a problem. Desperate situation now
7917 2018-01-28 21:33:47 Chris I was completely naive to the plan oil situation. What can normal people do to help or has it already gone too far. Heart breaking to see. Just shocking
7918 2018-01-28 21:33:47 I'm gonna redecorate my entire room and paint it and furnish it and I'm gonna get shelves so my crystals ain't on my tiny window sill anymore and so I don't almost knock my oil diffuser off my bedside cabinet every day and its gonna be such a calm environment in here I swear it
7919 2018-01-28 21:33:40 I've prepared a hearty pie with whipped cream, cream, and olive oil.
7920 2018-01-28 21:33:40 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
7921 2018-01-28 21:33:40 Feeling stuck? Try making some art using oil pastels - consider the concept of transportation in a macro style.
7922 2018-01-28 21:33:40 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
7923 2018-01-28 21:33:40 To make a quick cake sandwich, first, take a sliced peeled egg. Combine with 500 ml of strong vegetable oil and stir in 3 drops of honey. Finally, sauté.

7926 2018-01-28 21:33:34 @ChrisGPackham I would coltan mining in the same bracket as palm oil plantations in terms of what they are doing to the environment
7927 2018-01-28 21:33:28 Literally: to sell oil
7928 2018-01-28 21:33:15 We stopped buying anything that has palm oil in it some time ago. Even more determined having seen the 000s of hectares of forest destroyed to plant palm oil. Tragic.
7929 2018-01-28 21:32:51 Oga that one is story you're saying. You should be lucky, cos if so, some set of individuals will grab the oil for themselves.
7930 2018-01-28 21:32:40 I use it as a carrier oil with my essential oils. And I wash my face so I’m not only putting oils on

#AdviceAngel says watch $GEV
7932 2018-01-28 21:32:18 girl you gotta use coconut oil on your hair the night before washing it. not use it as styling unless it’s on your ends
7933 2018-01-28 21:32:12 My thoughts exactly, more like highlighting our demands for palm oil, threatening the indigenous peoples and rainforest.
7934 2018-01-28 21:32:07 Kind of ironic that Packham is bemoaning palm oil farming when it was the myopic pursuit of precautionary principle under climate alarmism that pushed palm oil industry to current levels.  #insearchofthelostgirl
7935 2018-01-28 21:32:05 @ChrisGPackham 's programme #insearchofthelostgirl is just heartbreaking. Acre after acre of palms for palm oil. So much forest destroyed.
7936 2018-01-28 21:31:53 Oil and gas is a non renewable resource why would you not support other means of cleaner energy
7937 2018-01-28 21:31:51 wondering #if The Matrix could be in a cute movie where a man puts oil on another man as friends (not mean)
7938 2018-01-28 21:31:32 Did you oil then things!?
7939 2018-01-28 21:31:29 Like............im eating this burger that someone fried using the oil from they hand...........a..............me pingy
7940 2018-01-28 21:31:27 No palm oil for me.
7941 2018-01-28 21:31:18 Vera's good. But I'm watching @ChrisGPackham In Search of the Lost Girl. All about palm oil and its destructive growth in Sumatra.
7942 2018-01-28 21:31:14 Adding grape seed oil in all my hair days.
7943 2018-01-28 21:31:11 butter coffee: Arabica coffee brewed from grounds + 1 Tbsp Kerrygold butter + 1 Tbsp coconut oil, blend, then top w/ cinnamon
7944 2018-01-28 21:30:55 why’s my mum watching a documentary on palm oil, cos that’s fun
7945 2018-01-28 21:30:54 Congratulations sir Happy Birthday Sir. Fresh Oil Sir and Supernatural Wisdom for exploits in ministry.
7946 2018-01-28 21:30:53 It's the weather. Na baba blue go do. But palm oil and sugar works faster
7947 2018-01-28 21:30:40 Phil, I have sent @realDonaldTrump the same. The Gulf South is still very much hurting with thousands upon thousands of jobs lost, businesses closed due to the de-facto moratorium. Get rid of over regulation & red tape and #help the Oil Field Again.
7948 2018-01-28 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
7949 2018-01-28 21:30:13 Thank you @ChrisGPackham for trying to find this girl & in the meantime shed a light on epic deforestation & palm oil wrecking our world. I read every label & try to avoid all products with palm oil in. Watch this show on iplayer please. #AntiPalmOil
7950 2018-01-28 21:30:12 Petroleum, or crude oil, forms when tiny little sea animals and plants die and then get mixed up with sand and slit on the sea floors.
7951 2018-01-28 21:30:10 lmaooo imagine his high voice “oil change?”
7952 2018-01-28 21:30:09 Ok, what's the deal with no using coconut oil on your face? You keep mentioning not to. But why not?
7953 2018-01-28 21:30:07 Now he's a minister there must be a vacancy on FA Select Committee. I suppose he's still on the Kurd APPG lobby group. I imagine he's supportive, if not a member, of Conservative Friends of Israel, given Israel is one of the few direct buyers of K oil.
7954 2018-01-28 21:29:35 Here I am thinking Palm Oil is quite literally the oil that comes from your hand and I was like "Oh.........thats kinda hot"

Wait don't press that unfollow button
7955 2018-01-28 21:29:31 @SethMacFarlane Honestly its most likely planned to run exactly as the oil industry does. Unfortunately that's just the way the world operates; The select few make the big dough while the rest of the "worker bees" get bare minimum wages. #GreenParty
7956 2018-01-28 21:29:11 I cleaned Pandora, changed her oil, got a new battery, and filled her up yesterday so don't be surprised if you see a silver box speeding in SD.

7958 2018-01-28 21:29:00 Again, I see no evidence that Labour understand the challenge. We don’t have time to shift the oil tanker that is Labour - we need to move straight to implementing the change now. That’s why we need people to make the change to the Greens now, then we’ll reach the tipping point.

7961 2018-01-28 21:28:04 Castor oil sanki motor yağı adı gibi durmuyor mu? Anlamı Hint yağıymış ama motor yağı gibi duruyor. Bence motor yağı olarak kullanılsın. Denenmeli.

7969 2018-01-28 21:26:47 People forget how bad high oil prices were for none energy companies. Money all goes for gas and no iPhone or internet.
7970 2018-01-28 21:26:46 Nor me. Chocolate isn’t the same anymore either. Too much crappy palm oil now.
7971 2018-01-28 21:26:32 Dalessandros. Better meat, less oil.

7975 2018-01-28 21:25:55 The United States was much more concerned with protecting Iraqi oil from attacks by Iran as it was shipped through the Persian Gulf. In 1987, an Iraqi Exocet missile hit an American destroyer, the USS Stark, in the Persian Gulf, killing 37 crewmen.  [on the house]
7976 2018-01-28 21:25:50 Virgin Coconut Oil . Can be pricey, but Costco sometimes has a gallon for $20. Wayyyy cheaper than buying a scented lotion that has it as the 50th ingredient!
7977 2018-01-28 21:25:49 Thick carpets. Truffle oil. Crocuses. #smalljoys
7978 2018-01-28 21:25:46 Something to watch for sure. USD heading to 88, on Its way to 85 with some bumps along the way IMO. Oil and Gold would benefit
7979 2018-01-28 21:25:36 So much more to this than 'just' looking for a lost girl.  Palm oil will be the next plastic but, sadly, is far less tangible and therefore less high profile. We shld ALL be aware of this & shop accordingly #noplastic #nopalmoil #chrispackham
7980 2018-01-28 21:25:31 I want a submarine sandwich, damn it! A big gooey one with tons of veggies and black pepper. Sesame oil. Mushrooms, garlic, red peppers, spinach, lettuce, black olives, tomatoes, avocado on the side.

7983 2018-01-28 21:25:14 0/10 definitely don’t do that it dried my skin out so bad and the thing is w things like proactiv it strips ur skin of natural oils so it’s confusing as shit for ur skin and it can sometimes (i’ve experienced this too) produce MORE oil to combat that which SUCKS

7986 2018-01-28 21:24:43 I have found tea tree oil to be really harsh on my skin. I cannot imagine to use it (undiluted) on my face. But if I have any bad spots, they are mostly there because of sensitivity and overreaction, so it might be that... xD

7997 2018-01-28 21:23:33 2 bank accounts with billions in them have been linked to Late Don Wani. His house that was destroyed was also built for him by oil companies who used him and his gang to protect oil installations and politicians. DSS will unveil more soon.
This is scary!

7999 2018-01-28 21:23:20 I agree.  Make sure you liquid cool your system with a nice olive oil.

8012 2018-01-28 21:21:20 oil prices are up because OPEC cut production to INCREASE prices & food prices always rise but haven't risen anymore % wise than 2015/16

8023 2018-01-28 21:19:43 Right now part of our taxes go to Dump playing golf, funding a war trying to protect oil interest for the rich, supporting the seriously over paid federal workers salary, pensions, vacations etc...  Cut their pay, no more wasteful Gov't spending,  and bring our troops home.

8032 2018-01-28 21:18:46 Spent my Sunday reading, doing homework & cleaning while josh fixes things around the house, changes my oil and hangs up the new stuff I got for the living room. Life is goooooooood.
8033 2018-01-28 21:18:42 You aren't that special. If there is oil there why should FL be more protected than CA?
8034 2018-01-28 21:18:38 Haven't you heard. It's because Norway is to dependent on oil.

8039 2018-01-28 21:17:57 No just in most cases. The fact is even if palm oil was grown in place of all animal products we would only need a small fraction of the farm land used for meat. A lot of that palm oil is used to fry food which we know is unhealthy.
8040 2018-01-28 21:17:43 Oddly, the cheap abundance of crude oil and relative ease of extraction was what fueled (no pun intended) the rise of fossil fuels to dominance in the first place. The "glory" days are long gone, but it is still cheaper to extract oil, than grow enough peanuts to run cars.
8041 2018-01-28 21:17:16 @Abdfislick_ yaan lagu qaldin. Soma Oil waxaa leh Cameron & Obama, xitaa iyaku kuma qorna ee waxaa ugu qoran Shiblaq & wiilkiisa Eryad oo "bad credit ah". Nimankani waa dilaaliin #Somalia waxay keliya oo heshiis la geli kartaa shirkad iyadu wax baarta oo qoda (drilling)

8043 2018-01-28 21:17:04 olive oil is where it’s at
8044 2018-01-28 21:16:49 I don’t use primer right now (cause I’m Cheap) but I am always moisturizing. I use cocoanut oil mixed with essential oils and aloe vera lotion. My face is only dry when I put make up on and it drives me nuts

8047 2018-01-28 21:16:34 I’m no skin guru so maybe coconut oil does work for some skin types. Idk. But EYE break out just THINKING about using it on MY skin 
8048 2018-01-28 21:16:20 Vitamin E Oil, Castor Oil, and Coconut Oil!! mix that together and rub it in your eyelash roots and you’ll be good to go!

8051 2018-01-28 21:15:25 Your diet looks fine

Though I Know that any time you make changes, there can be a detox period that seems really bad

I had that with coconut oil but it was the only thing that actually worked for my health issues
8052 2018-01-28 21:15:24 Great list. For myself, I like a 3:1 oil2vinegar ratio with Omega3-rich walnut oil to 1 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar. More calories but more filling, AND less tart.
8053 2018-01-28 21:15:11 Strange how people hate hydraulic fracking for fossil fuels, but if it was used for geo thermal... No issues. Technology has improved for processing oil sand which is why Canadian energy markets have expanded.

8058 2018-01-28 21:14:11 Our country buys oil from human-rights violators such as Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, and Venezuela.  Doing business with the devil doesn't really bother us.
8059 2018-01-28 21:14:06 If you think about it that's a great subsidy from the oil industry's point of view. They get to raise prices so high that most people can't afford the product. Then the government agrees to make up the shortfall. Everyone wins except for the public.

8066 2018-01-28 21:13:17 Traditional Italian food absolutely is.  Pasta is often times tossed with olive oil, grated parmesan, garlic and fresh tomatoes.  It's the American Italian that's high fat.  Neither fat or carbs are evil though just portions people eat and it's a false dichotomy to choose.

8098 2018-01-28 21:10:09 Every time I go to get my oil changed the men always flirt with me and give me extra money off . Today he was like "Damn you smell amazing. Whatever you got on its mesmerizing "....Y'all it was just my car air freshener 
8099 2018-01-28 21:10:09 It's Fentimans. Made with real oil of roses .
8100 2018-01-28 21:09:57 The multivitamin plus fish oil variety doesn't have as strong a fish taste, IMO
8101 2018-01-28 21:09:48 I use Sta-sof-fro braid spray and base my scalp with ORS hair food and coconut oil , works great for me
8102 2018-01-28 21:09:45 Your lack of rules let people litter and disregard the land! No oil Drilling West and East coast!
8103 2018-01-28 21:09:37 I have mag deficiency that I’m treating with transdermal oil, it was lack of K2 on vitamin D3 that lowered my magnesium more.
8104 2018-01-28 21:09:37 @EducatingDonna    That would be Scotland's oil....?

8106 2018-01-28 21:09:20 2. Whisk 1 egg per smash-slice (I did 4) with a tablespoon per egg of milk. Add some vanilla extract. Soak smash-slice on both sides. 

3. Heat lots of coconut oil in a pan until very hot. Add an egg-soaked smash-slice and fry on both sides.
8107 2018-01-28 21:09:15 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.

8109 2018-01-28 21:08:56 Palm oil is tremendously unhealthy and in a surprising number of foods. :O
8110 2018-01-28 21:08:53 It’s a long learning curve and I’m still learning lol. Basically.. you still need some oil. You need to shake it up plenty of times. And don’t overfill the basket.
8111 2018-01-28 21:08:51 I wish I could give my car the money to get its own oil changed
8112 2018-01-28 21:08:50 I am very much not a fan. I also can’t stand fish and I’m detecting a tiny hint of it and it’s not for me. 

Doc says he wants me doing fish oil though. Hm.
8113 2018-01-28 21:08:44 ...weird niche like underwater guys or oil/gas rig guys, but they definitely take home a bigger pay check. This is all highly dependent on location though, as a rural/semi-rural person I wouldn’t be surprised if the situation was different in urban areas.
8114 2018-01-28 21:08:40 if i dont sleep peacefully like a baby tonight after all that baby oil after my bath. im going to be sad.
8115 2018-01-28 21:08:40 I tell cafes and restaurants I have a seed oil allergy akin to a peanut allergy! that gets the truth out of the chef! I learned chefs blend Olive oil at times with Veg oil telling this little white lie!
8116 2018-01-28 21:08:23 So, what I’m saying is that while I think it’s great the US now produces lotsa oil & gas, the position of these in the wide world still needs to be developed. It’s foolish to plant the Stars &  Stripes on an oil output statistic and shout “Dominance”!
8117 2018-01-28 21:08:21 I have phoned ahead to one or two restaurants on the rare occasions when I’m forced to not eat out of my own kitchen. Can I speak to the chef please? What cooking oil do you use?              Shocked silence.....Sorry, what did you say?
8118 2018-01-28 21:08:06 Could .. or may .. but Canada won’t benefit nearly as much as it could due to our constitution and inept federal government, preferring unethical oil imports into E-Canada while making oil exports to high growth Asia via BC ports very difficult.

8123 2018-01-28 21:07:30 If you can never get tempeh to taste well: MARINATE THAT SHIT. 
Cut into tiny pieces, marinate in a oil or water based spice mix w/ soy sauce and whatever goes with the dish you’re cooking. 
Then fry on high for 5-10 minutes before other everything else. It won’t taste funky!!!

8126 2018-01-28 21:07:03 56%-75% of a hazelnut kernel is oil.

1 serving of nutella has 21g of sugar, compared to 1 serving of grapes which has 20g of sugar.

Do some folks just have a phobia of things broken up into its constituents?
8127 2018-01-28 21:06:58 Nope I do it in a deep frying pan, stove top. Olive oil and Kosher salt. Seer both sides then throw in a sliced onion and reduce heat. Makes great gravy too
8128 2018-01-28 21:06:53 Also steam - fill mixing basin bowl with boiling hot water from kettle, stick 1-2 drops of peppermint oil in bowl, create tent with towel over head and bowl, breathe in steam and peppermint, splutter, blow snot out (useful to have a hankie nearby!)

8149 2018-01-28 21:03:57 I don't think so - there's probably be a tick still in it or at least its head.  Try some lavender oil to stop the itching...
8150 2018-01-28 21:03:57 And it's not an oil platform, but an abandoned WW2 observation thing but you're thinking of the right place
8151 2018-01-28 21:03:55 @bernie_marcus Wow, Bernie. That was a load of crap you shared on #FauxNews FTR: That bonus wouldn’t cover my current car repairs: 4 tires, alignment, oil change, inspection, coil spring(with used parts) I used my “stupid brain” to figure that out.

8154 2018-01-28 21:03:53 Oh, there is. As I say to my friends, it's a two bottle story 

But me and fish oil = no no.
8155 2018-01-28 21:03:53 Not if oil money has anything to do with it.  Palms will be greased
8156 2018-01-28 21:03:41 I think Jiff is pretty similar except it uses soy oil instead of palm oil? 
8157 2018-01-28 21:03:37 Little hazy on the details because I did this research a while ago but I believe they traded the patent with ig farben a chemical company for their synthetic rubber. Ig Farben was second largest stockholder in standard oil NJ. Many connections to the bushes and Chase bank as well
8158 2018-01-28 21:03:36 if u take evening primrose oil u gotta take that shit consistently every day otherwise you will get spotty and/or a possibly unwanted moustache. Other than that it's a free 4 all sometimes I take 2 vit c in one day just to feel alive

8163 2018-01-28 21:03:08 The young man even uploaded a picture of the store and drums of palm oil outside of it.
8164 2018-01-28 21:03:06 Links from lower salt intake to lower blood pressure to lower mortality are weak. A healthy human body is REALLY good at homeostasis, and will seek salt from other sources if it’s reduced in meals. Meanwhile added salt is replaced by sugar and oil, which is worse. #saltfacts
8165 2018-01-28 21:02:57 I can’t take the risk.
8166 2018-01-28 21:02:40 You may object that it’s possible to blend these crudes with heavier oils. True, but blending of many US crudes yields a “dumbbell” mix which yields a lotta gasoline and a lotta fuel oil, but no middle distillates, which is what the world really runs on.
8167 2018-01-28 21:02:38 if you have long wavy frizzy hair, renpure argan oil luxurious shampoo and conditioner is a godsend

8182 2018-01-28 21:00:21 Their washes and softeners come in a variety of scents, but this one is my favorite, and has the highest sillage (hours of the day in which the beard stays soft) rating. Use the wash twice a week, and the softener every day. Apply oil after shower, of course.

8185 2018-01-28 20:59:41 I think the only time I've used coconut oil is on my legs when I make a oil sugar scrub. After you shave your legs, they are so soft and silky. I die 
8186 2018-01-28 20:59:35 The same goes for most other markets for various demand/technical reasons, mainly the high light distillate yields from US light tight oil.

8188 2018-01-28 20:59:22 Just a thought m8, I've seen so many videos and reports online about giving dogs CBD oil, dog suffering from fits, seizures etc have been given it and it has kept it away, or cures it. Just thought I'd mention it m8.
8189 2018-01-28 20:59:18 I can't smoke or eat or ingest weed at all! Gives me massive anxiety. Even CBD oil. So it's definatly not an option for some. However I can clean my room Bucko!

8195 2018-01-28 20:58:28 Barring oil rich Arabs or dodgy Russian billionaires who realistically is going to want to buy a business and then run it at a massive loss? I was fortunate enough to grow up in the 70s and 80s and have seen the club at its peak, it will happen again if it takes 10 yrs so be it
8196 2018-01-28 20:58:19 So while US light tight oil did indeed (largely) drive West African grades out of the US market, the US has on current refinery configurations reached its limit of absorption of these crudes.
8197 2018-01-28 20:58:11 I just want to put a few drops of peppermint oil in my nose so I can breathe again 
8198 2018-01-28 20:58:05 The free unit will answer this but price ladder includes to much noise. Where the footprint includes only what’s been traded so it’s far more objective. Spoofing makes ladder difficult
8199 2018-01-28 20:57:58 The Saudis are running out of oil so what are they up to?  Yemen is new ground for them to play in.  I really don't know what Yemen has for oil reserves.
8200 2018-01-28 20:57:47 I need to make time to get a oil change
8201 2018-01-28 20:57:16 but oil does not dissolve in water
8202 2018-01-28 20:56:52 There is a perfectly sensible one. Indy Scotland will be able to do business with TWENTY SEVEN other countries rather than JUST ONE. Also - UK will HAVE TO trade with us -  unless they're going to buy things they don't have, like water, energy & oil, from USA?! DOUBT THAT! Lol!
8203 2018-01-28 20:56:51 As the chief security officer of the state,Gov. Ganduje's priority should be ensuring law and order in his state,any action of his capable of causing wanton destruction of life and property of his state should not be politicised,at the long run if the state...

8206 2018-01-28 20:56:31 Oil?  I believe from my own research into Impulse Energy Systems that we are about to enter a new age of free energy.  The atom runs on energy drawn from the vacuum,  impulse technology opens a gateway to the vast energy from the vacuum.  Look at the magnet try north to north
8207 2018-01-28 20:56:27 The founding fathers like all of that time were fighting slavery We as a offspring of England were all slaves to the taxation without representation . Within 100 years of independence we freed the actual slaves brought by their own people to sell like oil ...
8208 2018-01-28 20:56:20 This is also true in the US where average refinery crude feed remains at 30-32 API (and has done since the 1980s). USkight tight oil is largely 40-45 API gravity or higher.
8209 2018-01-28 20:55:55 S/o to my mama for paying for my oil change 
8210 2018-01-28 20:55:34 Urban decay de-slick primer. It does control oil but it looks very patchy and awful when it dries
8211 2018-01-28 20:55:23 I do ‘em old school style. I like mine cut on the thicker side (versus paper thin) with a quick soak in ice water to remove some starch. Dry & fry in batches in canola oil around 350 until golden brown. Season with S&P and let cool in single layer on paper towel lined sheet pan.

8249 2018-01-28 20:49:53 Pres ("More flexibility after the election, "1980s calling") Obama was obsequious to Putin.

8364 2018-01-28 20:29:34 My friend grew up with him and thinks the world of his family. Memories include hand- delivering heating oil to poor people so they wouldn't freeze to death. @RepJoeKennedy has always been a man of service. His State of the U response will no doubt be an eloquent counterpunch .

8366 2018-01-28 20:29:18 I love twitter discourse on what skin products to use. At one point I used to put coconut oil on my face and although it didn't break me out I switched over to shea butter. Either one works wonders as a body lotion substitute though

8376 2018-01-28 20:27:07 The oil+gas idustry I infer was the most important of mankinds history. But its on the way out. We can either stay stuck to it or we can have some forsight and position ourselves to be leaders in what will replace it. Old men choices at this point considering those in power.
8377 2018-01-28 20:26:55 Everything is from D-Scam babes. The avocado oil is from PnP

8384 2018-01-28 20:25:53 We scrape by. They are also occasionally used by the gamekeeper to oil the guns.  So we are certainly flexible.

8397 2018-01-28 20:24:12 about driving up the price of oil. The Bush family was quite invested in oil, and at the time, George W. Bush was in charge of the family business. Therefore creating a war in the middle east would drive oil prices up exponentially. And it did. The Bush's got richer!
8398 2018-01-28 20:24:07 Kurdish oil contracts. Obviously no conflict of interest in UK backed "moderate rebel" Syria regime change/Iraq Kurds.

8404 2018-01-28 20:23:22 Is volume over value the energy coverage mantra at @nytimes then? I’d add to @JeffDSachs comment that the story also shows ignorance of major issues in the US tight #oil industry. Crude quality, for starters.

8407 2018-01-28 20:22:49 Man like have these people never had to mix this stuff up after it sat a while? It's just like stirring peanut butter, they're both suspensions. And palm oil might not be perfect but it's better than vegetable oil.
8408 2018-01-28 20:22:30 Not for money. Not for oil!
8409 2018-01-28 20:22:20 Our idiotic Sec of State, Tillerson, said in Warsaw on Holocaust Remembrance Day, we can "never be indifferent to the face of evil." I'd remind this oil pig that he was appointed by the 'face of evil' and if he really believed what he says he would resign immediately. Lying ass.
8410 2018-01-28 20:22:11 Andy bought a deep fryer and now our house constantly smells like oil, we’re probably gonna gain a lot of weight, and he’s convinced he should open a restaurant

8414 2018-01-28 20:21:21 So you're saying that America needs to choose between importing oil or fracking? Why not throw coal in there too? Wait what?
8415 2018-01-28 20:21:18 Why tf would you rub oil on your face??? Just because it comes from coconut doesn’t mean it has magical properties lmao
8416 2018-01-28 20:21:18 Does anyone have any recommendations on where to go to change your oil?

8418 2018-01-28 20:21:12 And why the Fuck do both sides endless fund The Military Industrial Complex (700 billion this year- 55% of our discretionary  budget - more then next 10 nations) ? Putting lower/middle men/women at risk? Democracy? bullshit- to protect/expand corporate interest & addiction to Oil
8419 2018-01-28 20:20:54 PSA: Aceité de Melaleuca (Tea Tree oil) works wonders on pimples! Put a tiny bit on at night and it’ll be all dried up in the morning. Be sure to apply the oil only on the pimple itself because it’s very drying on the skin

8429 2018-01-28 20:19:24 Oh no. I just thought the new colored heads were cool. Up until now the only colored heads you could get were these weird ones with oil between the layers.

8432 2018-01-28 20:19:11 It wasn't Turkey that rid Syria of ISIS terrorist group, it was the YPG. However, Turkey did fund ISIS by taking their wounded to Turkish hospitals, secretly buying Syrian oil from them (Russia provided satellite images), and allowing foreign terrorists entrance into Syria.
8433 2018-01-28 20:19:03 So you see . . . oil and vinegar is way better than light mayo on Subway sammies.  It's all about smart choices.

8459 2018-01-28 20:14:37 Capitalism affords the most freedom and upward mobility for individuals and society as a whole. But our government reps should not be able to sell our natural resources such as water, oil, gas, electricity, and wireless spectrum to the highest bidding corporate interests.

8461 2018-01-28 20:14:19 Climate change is already having a dramatically negative effect on marine life, shorelines & plant life.

8467 2018-01-28 20:13:41 Dude, I think oil might get more expensive one more time but, within 10-15 years, price will crash and never get back up again. And, yes, us screwing up in the ME certainly contributed to making oil more expensive in 2004-2006. It wasn’t the only factor but...

8498 2018-01-28 20:10:06 True, but you can't force people to think for themselves any more than you can legislate stupidity. Snake oil salesmen & cult leaders will always have a steady supply of victims. History has shown that power in the hands of ordinary men can be corrupted.
8499 2018-01-28 20:10:01 
8500 2018-01-28 20:09:54 I wonder who will be remembered as a leading voice for progressive juris prudence and who will be remembered as a snake oil selling Elmer Gantry (if history remembers him at all)? “Governor” isn’t a term of nobility, Mike. You ain’t governor of shit.
8501 2018-01-28 20:09:44 Manges des petits pois c'est bon et rapide à faire, with a little touch of olive oil
8502 2018-01-28 20:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.
8503 2018-01-28 20:09:36 Castor oil
8504 2018-01-28 20:09:24 Thank you for continuing to get the message out about oil and gas companies contributing to global warming
8505 2018-01-28 20:09:24 I consider the hideous Patriot Act, legalization of rendition, and the increase of targeting Muslims (anti- 1st Amendment) as being assaults on the rule of law.    Nevermind Bush/Cheney letting their friends enrich themselves with wars over oil.
8506 2018-01-28 20:09:23 I would love an oil massage like I use to get....
8507 2018-01-28 20:09:04 Again, I am a fool for betting on the hacker "No Dough" Beau Hossler in the PGA Farmers San Diego Open. He is so pathetic that his odds of 100-1 lured me into the wager. Surprisingly, he got into contention but has now folded like a tri-fold wallet in a fat man's back pocket @pga
8508 2018-01-28 20:08:54 the response of people like @DancingTheMind is- "Italy only have higher survival rates because they have more olive oil in their diet. Italian system is evil/lacks compassion because it's not directly controlled and administered by the state even though it has universal coverage"
8509 2018-01-28 20:08:54 Now all my dry spots are gone, I have an oil problem, so went and asked the ladies to recommend some stuff at least for my day routine to see how that goes. If it gets better then there’s also a night cream I’m looking at trying since the one I currently use might be too oily
8510 2018-01-28 20:08:41 Except for the palm oil please!!
8511 2018-01-28 20:08:35 Re: the deforestation complaint though, Nutella's been using sustainable palm oil sources for years
8512 2018-01-28 20:08:31 Olive oil for teeth and hair. Coconut oil for skin?
8513 2018-01-28 20:08:29 It’s not insider speak / many industries with safety issues use it including oil and gas, construction, aviation etc
8514 2018-01-28 20:08:07 Darn I just started writing something; anyways, toss PETE #1 plastics; toss any non-organic nightshade veggies that make you bite your tongue easily; lower some med doses if so til dizziness or low blood pressure decreases; take flaxseed oil or Coconut; must be of good quality.
8515 2018-01-28 20:07:58 oil change

8518 2018-01-28 20:07:39 i use oil based remover
8519 2018-01-28 20:07:39 I hadn't but now that you've given me an idea........
I'll keep you updated, gotta oil my reel
8520 2018-01-28 20:07:21 #FakeNutellaFacts  Republicans also use it in place of oil for their cars.
8521 2018-01-28 20:07:17 They were very crispy, not oily so only a tiny bit I think (maybe spray oil?)
8522 2018-01-28 20:07:17 @AndrewScheer @BorisJohnson @JulieBishopMP Silence from each of you because Israel or oil isn't involved?
8523 2018-01-28 20:07:06 or maybe she doesn’t like the thought of eating that much oil and sugar?
8524 2018-01-28 20:07:04 お疲れ様でした。ゆっくり体を休めてください。
8525 2018-01-28 20:07:03 Does the castor oil thing for getting thicker eyebrows really work ?

8527 2018-01-28 20:06:51 Judging by the comments, it doesnt seem to be the case, some call out the sugar and palm oil but they seemed freaked out on what's in it.... has no one read the list of ingredients in processed food?
8528 2018-01-28 20:06:49 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "Comment je défrise mes cheveux crépus avec Olive Oil | Relaxed Hair - Dolla" à l'adresse
8529 2018-01-28 20:06:49 I read this as “canoli oil” and wondered what my life was missing for a solid minute
8530 2018-01-28 20:06:27 Wow, oil and sultanas with Parmesan - weird,  but I love all those things. Will try it! xx
8531 2018-01-28 20:06:25 seriously lmao i have this oil for my hair to prevent anti frizz and it'll still frizz. i don't fucking get it hahaha
8532 2018-01-28 20:06:18 Ooh, great choice! The peppermint oil will leave your skin feeling refreshed, while honey and ground almonds give you unbelievable softness! 
8533 2018-01-28 20:06:13 Living in the countryside is all fun and games until you run out of oil and realise the house basically stops functioning 
8534 2018-01-28 20:06:11 FREEMASONS have got their own agenda.They want to extract oil etc, or destroy rivers and build dams to produce electricity. It is said that is what their master who is on another planet sent them to do on planet Earth before the Kingdom(Spaceship) comes.

8536 2018-01-28 20:05:27 I use jojoba oil for my eczema and it works really well too if you want an alternative! Less greasy and it has quicker results for me.
8537 2018-01-28 20:05:09 Yeah I always notice when I buy a fancy one it's not blended because of no palm oil!
8538 2018-01-28 20:05:06 Some of y’all look 22 going on 82. Drink water and use coconut oil.
8539 2018-01-28 20:05:03 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.

8550 2018-01-28 20:03:42 The usual motivated reasoning from the "our NHS" brigade is that places like Italy have higher survival rates because of "olive oil" but this is nonsense because this only determines the likelihood of contracting cardiovascular illness, not recovery.
8551 2018-01-28 20:03:36 The way I break screen protector amuses me aswear
8552 2018-01-28 20:03:23 Okay

8555 2018-01-28 20:02:57 Taste is pretty similar but texture isn't right. Extra egg and less oil was not the way to go it seems. Too rubbery. I also need to get hard butter next time to see if it helps the frosting firm up. I don't use hard butter though and I can't find half size packets anywhere.
8556 2018-01-28 20:02:56 Apparently you don't sit in the car during an oil change anymore (been a decade since I owned a car), so the dude was standing by my door waiting for me to get out and I stared at him like a retard and proceeded to ask the dumbest, most basic questions you could ever imagine.
8557 2018-01-28 20:02:53 There’s certain essential oil’s that help. Google it I don’t know the name of it

8567 2018-01-28 20:00:49 For Japan it was still much about oil and industry.  I think things would have played out the same.  Had we not been involved in WW1...
8568 2018-01-28 20:00:26 Thanks to their size and high oil content, two large Brazil nuts are the caloric equivalent of one egg.

8576 2018-01-28 20:00:00 The greasy thing you see when you open a jar of Nutella is the same substance I use to oil my bod. #FakeNutellaFacts
8577 2018-01-28 19:59:58 seriously love my stepdad  he changed my oil, put air in my tires, and changed the air filter. sweetest ever.

8584 2018-01-28 19:59:16 im still shook at the fact that people really still insist on using coconut oil on their face at all...like cmon y’all do better.
8585 2018-01-28 19:58:59 after having a migraine earlier in the week i was told to take primrose oil to stop it happpening again
8586 2018-01-28 19:58:55 He just handed over our national parks and coastlines to exploration and drilling!  How is he not perpetuating the oil ajenda exactly?
8587 2018-01-28 19:58:55 They claim to make our food more secure when each community could be growing and exporting food enough to support their own and surrounding communities. Permaculture and Aquaponics replacing monocrop, co-operative solar wind manufacturers replacing oil pipeline making.
8588 2018-01-28 19:58:51 They’re a toy of the Oil rich Arabs . When they get tired of it they’ll just walk away. So enjoy it while it lasts.

8590 2018-01-28 19:58:39 3 bottles of essential oil
8591 2018-01-28 19:58:31 New York strip, seasoned with kosher salt//cracked pepper and left to sit until it reaches room temp. Medium heat, canola oil, steak in 6 min on first side. Flip, 2 mins in add a knob of butter, thyme and a crushed garlic clove. Baste for 2 min. Take off, let rest for 15, serve
8592 2018-01-28 19:58:27 BF: What's that?

Me: Coconut oil. You can use it on your skin, hair, and for cooking.

BF: That's not true!

Me: It is! You can also use it as lube if you want.

BF: ...I don't want you shopping at that store anymore!

8596 2018-01-28 19:57:55 They didn’t taste of butter. Think they were roasted in a bit of oil (yes, parboiled) with sultanas, then a bit of Parmesan on top.
8597 2018-01-28 19:57:55 Agree. I see Immovable Object of loose 'cap' at say $60/bbl & Irresistible Force of secular decline in oil EROEI. Result is squeeze on IOCs/NOCs & incentive to transition from capital intensive oil commodity market to capital lite energy as service market paradigm
8598 2018-01-28 19:57:54 bourguignon is extremely simple to do. The most important is the Dutch oven (le Creuset or Staub is good). Then, sear beef at high temp with a little bit of oil, lower temp to add onion & shallot. When translucid, add wine (ex Bourgogne, I used a good enough Macon, but not great)
8599 2018-01-28 19:57:49 More like, I wish I had this guy on my team for all 82 and the playoffs 
8600 2018-01-28 19:57:48 tried to get an oil change today and completely forgot that all dealerships are closed on sundays 
8601 2018-01-28 19:57:40 First, there are no illegal human being. There are 'undocumented' people. When your forefathers came to the US. They were undocumented. They stole and murdered the natives for their land and property and continue to do so today. The US oil reserves belong to the Native Americans.
8602 2018-01-28 19:57:38 yuk. get that junk outta here. If they put oil and vinegar on it I would have screamed in horror
8603 2018-01-28 19:57:36 Castor oil!

8618 2018-01-28 19:55:48 Will New York City win the lawsuit? Though I don't think we can totally eliminate the oil companies, we do need to take more effective actions to stop contributing to global warming.
8619 2018-01-28 19:55:46 Changing my oil has changed my life.
8620 2018-01-28 19:55:40 @ ppl who say "the amount of sugar/oil is what put me off!" this is especially stupid because you are acting as if ur eating the whole jar in one sitting...... yo look up portions. you can relax now

8632 2018-01-28 19:53:34 I love coconut oil..
8633 2018-01-28 19:53:24 Projections may not be on realistic basis, there can be many assumptions to arrive at projections. Who knows about natural calamities ?  Nigeria is oil rich country.
8634 2018-01-28 19:53:17 My hair doesn't mess with coconut oil or any products with coconut oil in it. Coconut oil drys my hair out. Grape seed oil, almond oil, avocado oil & castor oil works great on my hair.
8635 2018-01-28 19:53:17 Initially this govt said the low oil price partly hindered their plans for economic growth. Now oil price is increasing yet things are hard.

8638 2018-01-28 19:53:00 Now bidon's Son is in charge of the Oil and Gas industry in the Ukraine...see that trickle down effect of liberals? SICK!
8639 2018-01-28 19:52:54 i had the same problem w/ using it as an eye makeup remover but then i started using a stick instead of my fingers to take out the oil and it never burned my eyes again
8640 2018-01-28 19:52:51 When ever I go to get my oil changed they always try to slap me with a list of stuff that they th and charge like $300+ for them to do and I'm like yeahhh no thanks dude. I know how you work, and I could do that myself. I only need an oil change because of my apartment complex.
8641 2018-01-28 19:52:49 Roman pizza - with thinly sliced potato, olive oil, and rosemary. Yum.
8642 2018-01-28 19:52:40 went to get my oil changed & didn’t know that you had to pull up so now there’s three ppl ahead of me 
8643 2018-01-28 19:52:36 Haha!! Oil is good at getting them off, but im sure there is a solution that gets them off if you bathe them in it x
8644 2018-01-28 19:52:34 Tanning oil smell reminds me of summer 
8645 2018-01-28 19:52:33 There should be a second photo of the empty pot on its side covered in engine oil lol

8655 2018-01-28 19:50:25 Just curious, does any1 remember GW Bush saying the war in Iraq wouldn't cost taxpayers a single dollar because he was going to use the sale of Iraqi oil to pay for his war that is still going on 15 years later?
8656 2018-01-28 19:50:25 But 1st a hot oil treatment
8657 2018-01-28 19:50:05 Two care tips instead: 

1) Boil some water in the dirty pan to loosen stuck-on food.

2) To "touch up" seasoning: fold a paper towel, hold it in tongs, dip it in oil. Then heat the pan and oil the affected area. If not hot enough to smoke, keep it over the heat until it does.

8665 2018-01-28 19:48:21 What on earth has Norway’s reliance on oil got to do with its membership of the EEA? Clueless.
8666 2018-01-28 19:48:18 I love @Nap85 aloe Vera pre-poo routine. It has worked wonders for my scalp  Decided to take it a step further and blend the aloe Vera with some tea tree oil, put it in an applicator bottle to apply & it is even better. 
8667 2018-01-28 19:48:18 Assad is the legitimate leader of Syria.  PKK gangs  in Afrin  with  Raqqa oil  and CIA is not.
8668 2018-01-28 19:48:02 The same mfs that was boasting about coconut oil now “hate” it and it’s soooo “bad” for you. Byeeeee i only use coconut oil and it works wonders 
8669 2018-01-28 19:47:57 Oh and what scientific proof do you cite that oil is not a sustainable renewable resource since we have never run out of of it? And, and what effect will millions of used toxic non-biodegradable batteries have when they are put in the earth?
8670 2018-01-28 19:47:57 Awarding myself 57 man points for wife n.1s car oil top-up & checking other levels ready for her zooming away for work tomorrow. Points lost if wrong oil & something breaks?
8671 2018-01-28 19:47:57 But I think his preparation was capitalized on our crude oil returns and unfortunately the crude oil's return dropped drasti
8672 2018-01-28 19:47:53 There is oil in your head...walahi.
8673 2018-01-28 19:47:45 Economy of scale is making batteries cheaper over time.  I am driving a Bolt with a 60kwh battery today and the car was pretty cheap.  The hydrogen fool cell idea is promoted by oil interests in order for them to keep control.  And they are failing because it can not be done.
8674 2018-01-28 19:47:45 I went to the store for dog food and deodorant but tell me why I came back with an oil diffuser and all this crap I didn’t need
8675 2018-01-28 19:47:31 If bakare has met what buhari met in 2015 he would have ran away. With no Reserve and worthless resources of falling crude oil and price instability
8676 2018-01-28 19:47:29 Today I noticed the avocado oil we use is made in Mexico (duh). I thought about what the almond industry is doing to California's water supply. (thread)
8677 2018-01-28 19:47:26 Monopoly power never works out to consumers favor, eg, big oil cos, price of gas moves in lockstep, but we are to believe no collusion.  Ditto air fare, telcom..... Answer is REGULATION.  IBM and ATT thrived for 30 yrs under gov't observation that they even paid for.
8678 2018-01-28 19:47:21 Just done the coconut oil hair mask... I hope it makes my hair less dry 
8679 2018-01-28 19:47:10 Went to go get a regular oil change for them to charge me for some shit I already knew about my car 
8680 2018-01-28 19:46:50 Nigerians can dig sha  na so we take find oil.
8681 2018-01-28 19:46:49 I'm pure because I think people should not die because of capitalism, your war for oil (that you pretend to be about terrorism), your insistence on a for-profit health care model, and not wanting to kill the planet at the risk of losing corporate campaign funding. Call me pure.
8682 2018-01-28 19:46:45 I don't use coconut oil for my face, but I do use it for the rest of the body, mixed with tea tree oil or some other essential oil. I do prefer it over other types of lotions.
8683 2018-01-28 19:46:36 Freeze, not seize. I think the idea is to prevent policy blackmail through punitive withdrawals of capital, something you'd likely be dealing with trying to go against Big Oil interests in which Saudi is crucial player.

Policy is hampered by its overreach & undue specificity tho
8684 2018-01-28 19:46:30 Coconut oil is good for that!
8685 2018-01-28 19:46:30 I need to oil my scalp 
8686 2018-01-28 19:46:28 Cleanser, toner, moisturizer, oil 

Hmmmm 
8687 2018-01-28 19:46:19 Don't cook with EVOO. It's low smoke point makes it a bad option for cooking. Heat damages the healthy fats and makes them toxic. Avo oil is far superior for cooking! Very high smoke point
8688 2018-01-28 19:46:06 Try it with added steamed #broccoli some chopped Halloumi and a drizzle of #oilve oil > delish :D

8693 2018-01-28 19:44:48 Anyone know how to change and oil pan? 
8694 2018-01-28 19:44:40 Moved into house years ago. Boiler stopped working in winter. Called plumber in to service and repair. "You've got no oil", tank was full. "You sure?". Took him to tank, indicator on full. Presses air release valve, indicator empties. No oil. A month with no hot water or heating
8695 2018-01-28 19:44:38 It made me break out badly and i was disgusted with it. I find olive oil to be better for my hair cause coconut oil smells great but like you said does nothing for me.
8696 2018-01-28 19:44:36 Coconut oil will change the flavor significantly. That's why using MCT Oil is preferable to normal coconut oil.
8697 2018-01-28 19:44:35 Just figure this out that applying castor oil on lashes actually helps you fall asleep early 

It been an hour that I applied and I'm yawning from past half an hour

When you finally build house on ur face and she still doesn't know the price, it will be hot oil and nerve gas.
VANITY...
8707 2018-01-28 19:43:11 The only thing coconut oil is good for is oil pulling on your teeth.

8709 2018-01-28 19:43:01 Wash and blow dry your hair , don’t put hella oil in it put it in when your like blow drying it
8710 2018-01-28 19:42:57 in principle some live near the sea, some arrarat and some near the oil, and other resources, perhaps you see what I meant, the guy loses his religious pickings, they still collectively have  $ billions, so its still what we call a pyramid sale....
8711 2018-01-28 19:42:45 Please stop using coconut oil on your face. Thanks.

8717 2018-01-28 19:41:33 My point was that natural resources *alone* aren't sufficient to support socialism. Venezuela has larger oil reserves than Norway (IIRC). Why is it a basketcase?  What other factor(s) account(s) for diffs between Norway & Venezuela?
8718 2018-01-28 19:41:32 Again 
8719 2018-01-28 19:41:32 The best thing to use coconut oil for is 
..wait for it..... COOKING OIL. Ya know... the thing it was meant for??? Why do we try to make everything so complicated like lets use it for its actual purple. Its a healthy fat.

8721 2018-01-28 19:41:13 This would be a good horror game for you. It's not so scary, but intense. I think it had a couple "oh shit" moments sense the idea is to hide in the darkness, find oil and clues to the story, and escape. If you are spotted you run like he'll the opposite way and hide.
8722 2018-01-28 19:40:56 Avocado oil

8742 2018-01-28 19:38:48 8 drops of oil of oregano and 1/2 a teaspoon of cayenne pepper in a shot glass of water 3 times a day until it's gone. Works, I promise.

8752 2018-01-28 19:36:39 The best way to ward it off is to crush a clove of garlic and swallow it in some olive oil. I recommend chasing it with juice immediately.  Absolutely disgusting but it works.

8798 2018-01-28 19:28:44 Some people have no idea about the (still huge) military capability of Russia, and the fact she had huge oil reserves and the world's largest gas reserves.  Some busted flush!

8801 2018-01-28 19:28:38 Like so many opportunists and greed, Koch brothers would have financed Hitler as so many wealthy folks smelling that opportunity did, including Rockefeller, Ford n the oil industry. Greed knows no crimes or decency.
8802 2018-01-28 19:28:32 Oh come now Dr.  Malhotra....are you telling us that a product that was created to be used as a machine oil could be toxic to humans?

That's just crazy talk!!

8804 2018-01-28 19:28:10 She talked about " clogging pores" & " cooking oil" , all the oils whether they are vegetal or not are likely to clog you pores or be used to fry food . Im just saying

8814 2018-01-28 19:25:31 Big difference, United earn all the money they spend even pay the Glazers millions every year. All the money City spend comes from Arab Oil. Without the Arab Oil Money City would be in D1
8815 2018-01-28 19:25:21 Resource Control as he puts it will not happen! Will the center recover and build up land it wasted in the years leading up to now? @APCNigeria knows oil will remain as the main income earner for for many years to come.
8816 2018-01-28 19:25:17 when i checked my phone i thought it was still 12 but its now 2:25 pm wheres my head at?
8817 2018-01-28 19:25:04 You mean the keystone pipeline that leaked over 200k gallons of crude oil? Also displacing native Americans? That pipeline?
8818 2018-01-28 19:24:49 I’ve literally tried every single tip I’ve read online to keep my hair curled for longer than 10 minutes & none of them have worked. I currently have mousse, salt spray, oil & hairspray in my hair right now & my hair still went from curly to flat in the space of 30 minutes 
8819 2018-01-28 19:24:30 He used to be more of a poly finisher, but he likes the more natural look of oil finishes these days.

8822 2018-01-28 19:23:28 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
8823 2018-01-28 19:23:18 Thanks Harry for the sick new mad main I got the oil slick one for my birthday
8824 2018-01-28 19:23:11 he is as dirty as they come but there's no chance the republican dominated congress is going to do anything since they want a dirty oil crony there
8825 2018-01-28 19:22:59 Anointed a young boy with oil this morning as I prayed for his toothache. His precious face. Those sad & almost scared eyes. 

I don't know that I've ever touched someone so gently in prayer before.

8828 2018-01-28 19:22:13 On this day back in 1998 Harry Stamper, an oil well tech, and the boys down at NASA drilled a hole and dropped a nuke on an asteroid.
8829 2018-01-28 19:22:02 Its not about knowing your own political beliefs. Its about mischaracterizing them. You are pro-pipeline, pro-fracking, pro-war-for-oil, pro-imperialism, pro-WallStreet, pro-bankster, pro-MIC....and you want to be called "center left" because of your embrace of feminism?
8830 2018-01-28 19:21:53 Stir it into some rice, put into a whole decapitated bell pepper, a bit of grated cheese, replace head, small drizzle of oil, bake for probably 30-40 mins.
8831 2018-01-28 19:21:51 yo make it like regular coffee. u put coconut oil/butter and heavy whipping cream in it though (no sugar) - it's good actually smooth AF. can goog a recipe. look it up in MyFitnessPal too it's got good #s
8832 2018-01-28 19:21:48 I remember too, but I prefer facts rather than guff. Trains ran better, and were a lot cheaper. NHS ran better. We mined coal. We built ships. Most of the misery in the 70's was caused by an International oil crisis and ideological battles with Tories.

8835 2018-01-28 19:21:38 I think Castor oil, shea butter, and etc are MUCH better alternatives.
8836 2018-01-28 19:21:25 Great oil! In Philadelphia, you can always find in @italianmarket!
8837 2018-01-28 19:20:59 Unpopular opinion: cocnut oil isn’t that great.

8840 2018-01-28 19:20:28 Sí, ya he visto que es usted muy cansino con la gráfica ésta que viene a recordarme a los no menos cansinos profetas del peak oil. Eso sería fabuloso para la manada a la que ud pertenece y los fans que le rodean, si no tenemos combustible, cerramos.

8846 2018-01-28 19:19:25 Saudi Arabia recently estimated the net worth of oil industry giant Saudi Aramco at $2 trillion.
8847 2018-01-28 19:19:22 All the more reason not to sell off any of our national parks, or monuments for oil, and minerals.

8863 2018-01-28 19:17:37 Pictures of oil rigs when talking about Newfoundland wages is sometimes misleading. Not everyone working on these rigs and platforms are making big money. Quite the opposite in some circumstances. We are not millionaires because we work out there.

8882 2018-01-28 19:15:07 Yessir, though it's not that the water mixes, it's that it is heavier, hits the bottom then evaporates almost instantly due to the oil pressing down on it then those gases expand launching everything.
8883 2018-01-28 19:15:07 @loose10lbs Free snake oil as well? No legal supplement can make you lose body fat as this claims, stop advertising false hope and educate people more on a decent change in diet. Diet for fat loss, exercise for muscle tone and this rubbish can give neither. Stop spamming rubbish.

8905 2018-01-28 19:12:01 Everything we export raises the prices & availability of that commodity for Americans HERE!! Do local communities benefit? Or just make the oil companies richer & govt tax gains? So Americans still don't reap benefits of self sustainability.
8906 2018-01-28 19:11:53 Crude oil + products is a disequilibrium system but most analysts approach it as an equilibrium system. That’s why they get it wrong. C.I. incorporates the complexities & feedbacks of system dynamics thru its basis in inventory & price.

8919 2018-01-28 19:10:50 The bullshit is strong today.

8922 2018-01-28 19:10:30 Oh ffs when will they stop using palm oil! It’s so frustrating that it’s in so much.  can companies not do anything without harming animals???
8923 2018-01-28 19:10:20 Unnecessary wars..Have the American people even come to terms with that yet, being that most wars are fought on some economic (oil) imperative?
8924 2018-01-28 19:10:19 僕はただ油にこんにちはを言う練習をする。
8925 2018-01-28 19:09:52 It won’t. Let it go and enjoy it for what is. Arsene going, Ivan going, Stan going, isn’t going to allow us to compete with the oil money, until that changes, nothing else will change, just enjoy the ride, or find another sport
8926 2018-01-28 19:09:42 My oil and vinegar brings all the boys to the yard, my sub is better than yours
8927 2018-01-28 19:09:27 because the fry them in vegetable oil which is made from vegetables because vegetables are cheaper than fats from animals? Try again tho.
8928 2018-01-28 19:08:56 Getting my oil changed and I really hope the mechanics aren’t judging too harshly how messy my car is
8929 2018-01-28 19:08:53 I attended a seminar once upon a time, the speaker, a stakeholder in the oil and gas sector narrated how he started his business in the 80s with N500. He tried to relate it to the present youths who spend that amount on recharge cards.

He forgot what N500 was in the 80s
8930 2018-01-28 19:08:46 I'm a white Christian mom who stands by the 99% who are appalled at the lack of character the so called president exudes..I don't trust him at all. He's a master manipulator..a snake oil salesman..a fake. I miss #PBO. 
8931 2018-01-28 19:08:17 But, but it's worse when Russia does it Laura! They are white Christians and they don't make cheap junk for the profits of the multinational corporations and Putin nationalized Russia's oil by taking it away from the Rothschild backed oligarchs, etc etc.
8932 2018-01-28 19:08:05 Can you use la croix in essential oil diffusers? Asking for a friend
8933 2018-01-28 19:08:02 The Argies just want them for the oil now.
8934 2018-01-28 19:07:58 There may not be oil, but at least there's a nice hearty helping of radioactive lead and radioactive polonium!
8935 2018-01-28 19:07:51 Oil down
8936 2018-01-28 19:07:44 wish i could screenshot how much oil is on my phone screen after making a phone call

8941 2018-01-28 19:06:02 ..which is displaced as the puddings bake. Whisk the eggs into the flour, mix the milk and water together in a measuring just and whisk it in gradually do you don't have any flour lumps. Put it in the fridge to rest for half an hour. Put a generous amount of oil into..

8943 2018-01-28 19:05:09 Is that y our gas prices r higher again. Adding 2 that this 0.25/gal tax trumps calling for? We'd b better w/foreign oil. I believe America can b great if politicians, environmental regs & greed r hindered.
8944 2018-01-28 19:05:07 @LiamHalligan You’ve got the causality between the USD and the price of oil the wrong way around in “Oil not Brexit, has driven sterling bounce” today. As crude is $ denominated, $ depreciation makes crude cheaper in terms of other currencies, lifting demand.
8945 2018-01-28 19:05:07 Maybe it was just when she saw how much sugar is is something they tried to promote as "healthy"! And palm oil threatens orangutans.

8949 2018-01-28 19:05:00 if you think that’s bad , imagine garlic essential oil
8950 2018-01-28 19:04:57 I know how to change the oil just not the brakes lol
8951 2018-01-28 19:04:51 getting my oil changed and the tv in the waiting room is showing a flying disk competition for dogs & their handlers and it's delightful
two guys sharing the room with me just muttered "this is what we get when there's no football", further proving that straight men are the worst
8952 2018-01-28 19:04:22 No worries, thank Alex Cain's 'Ratty' for the olive oil trick. Absolute life saver. Good thing about this hobby, every one always willing to help each other. Have to say though never had a good can of GW varnish.

8954 2018-01-28 19:04:03 I know 285. Holy Smoley. Friends think we are in danger on the oil rigs and we tell them, hell no, much more danger driving to and from!!
8955 2018-01-28 19:04:03 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; My cup runs over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days of my life; And I will dwell in the house of the Lord Forever.
Psalms 23:5-6
8956 2018-01-28 19:03:53 Newfoundland has been that way ever since the oil industry first started up. You are either rich or poor here,unless of course you are the so called middle class,lol. Most rich folks like to claim middle class status. Makes them feel like they deserve it more than others.
8957 2018-01-28 19:03:39 To take advantage of these healthy foods, helping whiten your teeth   without putting chemicals inside your mouth, try making this homemade  teeth whitener recipe. It combines stain-fighting ingredients like baking  soda, lemon essential oil and mashed berries.
8958 2018-01-28 19:03:35 it probably has something to do with water immediately evaporating and  exploding outward which makes the oil go with it?

8960 2018-01-28 19:03:06 Answer me this, what has Iran done to the USA? What about operation Ajax, when the CIA admitted overthrowing  mossedegh of Iran???... Because he was nationalising oil.
8961 2018-01-28 19:02:59 Reading the story, the issue with palm oil is the tearing down of native forests to farm palm oil?  What does it mean to be responsible? Still grown in Africa, but some guarantee forests weren't torn down to do it? Not a fan of telling other countries how to use their land TBH.
8962 2018-01-28 19:02:22 If Crooked Hillary won, the Keystone Pipeline and other oil sites wouldn’t be available.
8963 2018-01-28 19:02:20 I feel it. I also recommend geranium oil.

8965 2018-01-28 19:02:03 The vast majority of leaks are due to degraded engine gaskets, oil pan leaks, oil seals or bad connections #AutoServices

8971 2018-01-28 19:01:07 Garage door maintenance is just as important as an oil change on your vehicle. We often don’t catch a poor job:

8974 2018-01-28 19:00:58 Loaded with Palm Oil instead of Hazlenut and Cocoa
8975 2018-01-28 19:00:54 im literally losing hair because i was stupid and put oil on my scalp instead of on my hair and im going to be even more bald now
8976 2018-01-28 19:00:49 Freedom for Biafrans and their God given inheritance, let the oil suckers and blood spilling monsters call herdsmen headed by Buhari and Britain hear it,they created the monster Nigeria,now it's enough
8977 2018-01-28 19:00:42 Beard oil is a scam.
8978 2018-01-28 19:00:33 #Home #Maintenance #Tip.  When vinyl windows & doors don't operate smoothly, it's usually because gunk has built up in the channels. Try spraying dry PTFE spray lubricant on the contact points & wiping it off with a rag. Don't use oil lubricants as they can damage the vinyl.
8979 2018-01-28 19:00:29 Extrovertion olive oil. That’s how my mom says it.
8980 2018-01-28 19:00:28 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

8988 2018-01-28 18:59:06 At the house turning a classic into an elevated dish. Roasted Chicken Salad sandwiches with an aioli made from homemade relish , Olive oil mayo , Chinese mustard , fresh chopped Dill , Tarragon , and a pinch of Thyme. Served on a Garlic butter Kaiser Roll.
8989 2018-01-28 18:58:26 Lmaoooo.  And I been going ham with the castor oil.  My hair and scalp gotta be fed up with my shit.
8990 2018-01-28 18:58:25 Sifting through the tweetstorm, it appears she was shocked by the amount of oil in it.  Really?  As if you couldn't tell from eating it??? Good advice for all: learn how to read nutrition labels, it's not that hard!
8991 2018-01-28 18:58:23 Shouts out to my stripped drain plug for making a simple oil change out not so simple 
8992 2018-01-28 18:58:07 It depends on how many parts of kerosene goes into how many parts of palm oil.
8993 2018-01-28 18:58:03 Although there is no coconut oil involved; the so called 'choking putte' has grated coconut as a demarcation at both ends of the cylindrical poison; probably an antidote.
8994 2018-01-28 18:57:56 vitamin c serum, vitamin e oil, black seed oil, retinol
8995 2018-01-28 18:57:48 As with reserves, demand depends on price, which has as much to do with financial demand as physical demand. eg in 2008 oil price crash physical oil demand remained high but bank trade finance (eg L/Cs) froze & could not accommodate it
8996 2018-01-28 18:57:46 Nah, I don’t care about them.. but I Becky from Alabama had to go. Ohhh and the white girl that spit and put toilet water in her roommates coconut oil and water
8997 2018-01-28 18:57:45 This is an inevitable conflict.. What did the Kurds think? That USA would defend them? That USA would airlift the oil that they have stolen? Really!
8998 2018-01-28 18:57:43 It spreads the fire because it spreads the oil without smothering the fire
8999 2018-01-28 18:57:42 I’ve kind of been following @nailogical ‘a suggestions about growing your nails and it’s been working. (Too cheap to get the oil) but I’ve been keeping my nails painted and my left hand already has long nails. My right hand won’t grow but oh well
9000 2018-01-28 18:57:40 Once u understand the term 'under recovery'of oil companies, u will agree that this govt has done right thing by not burdening oil companies more which is bad for long term

9006 2018-01-28 18:56:42 I know ur reading is poor and u don't know anything on facts. Read and check the term 'under recovery' of oil companies. How previous govt fooled by burdening oil companies.
M so happy this govt is not giving subsidies and thinking of long term

9017 2018-01-28 18:55:10 Similarly to apple cider vinegar, some swear that using citrus fruits — including lemon and/or orange peels, or lemon essential oil,  which contain beneficial acids — also does the trick for whitening  teeth.

9020 2018-01-28 18:54:45 Liberal men are all creepy looking.   I’m guessing the reason they worship Obama so much is because he’s the one rare liberal that doesn’t look like a child rapist and happens to have some charisma.    He’s an obvious snake oil salesman to the rest of us.
9021 2018-01-28 18:54:43 I need a derogatory name for the FIAT.  Something to do with pasta? Maybe a cannoli or some olive oil?
9022 2018-01-28 18:54:42 okay so i've been kinda "arguing" about this with a friend: is it better to moisturizer your skin or let your skin produce oil/... on "his own" and use no skin care at all

9033 2018-01-28 18:53:37 Ok. Good reason to buy from Tropical Traditions. And good reason to promote growth worldwide instead of the way the global elitists want to do it.
 Hand harvested and organic. Palm oil is very healthy.
9034 2018-01-28 18:53:34 @nicolconcilio the video of nick rubbing coconut oil on your dog had me CRYING. you guys are the cutest dog parents
9035 2018-01-28 18:53:32 just learned about what virgin olive oil does for your yoni. who knew.
9036 2018-01-28 18:53:24 And, they have virtually unlimited hydro-electric, and will continue to profit by selling their oil to the rest of the world.  Smart, lucky Norwegians...

9042 2018-01-28 18:53:04 This is no lie
9043 2018-01-28 18:52:48 Very true! That was always one minor annoyance; you could only display oil pressure or temperature, not both simultaneously, in the old cluster.
9044 2018-01-28 18:52:40 If the soul is ripped out of the club just to have some awful oil billionare human rights absuing monarchy own us, then yes
9045 2018-01-28 18:52:29 Ok ok cool we can start with the basics oil changes.air filters, brakes ! 
9046 2018-01-28 18:52:23 Please do not use coconut oil on your face 
9047 2018-01-28 18:51:56 The best US could do - to increase sanctions - to block VIP accounts, to ban oil trade and Swift
9048 2018-01-28 18:51:52 Oh. No nothing like that! Crushed pumpkinseed brittle, pumpkinseed oil, smoked sea salt, vanilla IC.
9049 2018-01-28 18:51:51 Will never understand the whole “use coconut oil for everything”. For why? Clogged pores? 
9050 2018-01-28 18:51:47 The church ones are worse. Oil wells that tapped into hell, pastors who survived falls out of planes, never-happened miracles of someone someone else knew
9051 2018-01-28 18:51:32 "Industrial" is meaningless.  Was it solvent extraction using chemicals like hexane, or mechanical, using short time extrusion cooking and physical squeezing in an oil press?
9052 2018-01-28 18:51:29 I love people who think chemicals are bad! Although seriously the whole "clean" eating and beauty thing really bothers me.

I  QVC though 

But mainly for beauty special offers, not snake oil. I could go to goop for that.

9054 2018-01-28 18:51:20 You are in a British garden. In front of you is an oil spill. The woodpigeons are jigging. The flood is too tired to talk.
9055 2018-01-28 18:51:15 The taxes don't just have to be centered along the working class, as you know it's only like that because big industries like oil and such pay lobbyist to keep the taxes on the working class and away from the higher class even though they could handle and afford the increases tax
9056 2018-01-28 18:51:09 Not that simple. Bush’s FATHER  put Sadaam into power. He learned the CIA’s tactics and decide not to sell them oil anymore thinking he was untouchable knowing how they operate. They then used 9-11 as a stepping stone for a unjustified war.
9057 2018-01-28 18:50:42 No oil but massive energy surplus exported as aluminium, silicon etc and that's before we even mention fish & tourism! Not that I think Corbyn is right, mind.

Has anyone else heard this?
9060 2018-01-28 18:49:56 A warm bath with Epsom salts and cinnamon oil and Daphnis et Chloe playing in the background make for the most relaxing Sunday I’ve ever had at one of the most stressful times in my life. A little bit of Ravel does wonders on stressed minds.
9061 2018-01-28 18:49:44 Also you will have to be super careful how you take yourmakwuo off. You can’t run oil based cleansers over them or  it will remove the lash  glue. But if you take your time and are delicate putting makeup on and off they will last and you will look extra beautiful in the am!

9064 2018-01-28 18:49:30 mr president oil black in 72$, y our production 1.2 MM bd (2018 were 10 mmBd),
9065 2018-01-28 18:49:09 High tariffs on solar panels imposed by Trump were done to appease the oil industry! Trump and his ilk are members of the drill baby drill club. They don't want to solar panels or wind turbines. Big oil bankrolls the GOP!
9066 2018-01-28 18:49:03 Great question! 

Pretty sure they’d like a nation where billionaires had it all & everyone else had no rights, a nation without immigrants, fully dependent on oil, with no public education, no consumer protections or environmental protections, run by Old Testament law. 
9067 2018-01-28 18:49:01 Funny how all you liberal hate the man. I would be elated if are liberal gov't could get are economy going like the US economy. But you can thank him for the spin off from their strong economy in helping Oil, Forestery, Agriculture and Auto say " Thank You Donald".

9069 2018-01-28 18:48:45 anyone watching golf today from San Diego (Torrey Pines), picture off-shore drilling ... Donald J Trump wants oil rigs off Pacific Coast -- he really isn't quite right!
9070 2018-01-28 18:48:39 Agreed, yet headline demands compactness. How can we rephrase it?

“13-year-old child on bike struck by oil truck driver in Bed-Stuy Friday night pronounced dead at hospital, police say”. Replaced ‘cyclist’ with ‘child on bike’, added ‘driver’, removed ‘A’, ‘an’, ‘was’, ‘nearby’
9071 2018-01-28 18:48:38 Spending the day doing my oil change and cleaning out my car. 
9072 2018-01-28 18:48:34 The Koch Bros are dirtier than the tar sands oil they’re taking out of Northern Alberta!
9073 2018-01-28 18:48:31  you be using wild growth? or buy black castor oil peppermint, that make your hair grow fast too.
9074 2018-01-28 18:48:31 I'm starting a new skin care routine with Sk-ii products and tea tree oil. Super excited for these results !

9076 2018-01-28 18:48:21 I always just use coconut oil on everything there's Different Strokes for different folks
9077 2018-01-28 18:48:17 Another option is to  apply coconut oil to a corner of a  clean  washcloth and rub it on the  teeth. A bonus regarding  coconut  pulling?  Coconut oil has antimicrobial  properties so it’s  great for  protecting  and cleaning your gums as well.
9078 2018-01-28 18:48:15 More, CONVENIENT, high speed transit means less dependence on anyone's oil!
9079 2018-01-28 18:48:11 Trump failed at Casino biz, that takes talent. That's about as embarrassing as being born rich and failing in the oil biz.
9080 2018-01-28 18:47:56 Simply  put a spoonful of coconut oil in  your mouth and swish it between your  teeth for five to  20 minutes, or  add a few drops to your toothbrush and  brush it on.
9081 2018-01-28 18:47:45 I just burned my face with oil from the damn bacon bot & that shit hurts  Can’t wait to go home.
9082 2018-01-28 18:47:41 I need 2 get an oil pen BADLY
9083 2018-01-28 18:47:39 "'Peak oil,' if the term could be given solidity and mass, would be like a wet rag.

Except that the wetness isn't water - it's alcohol. And the rag is stuffed into a bottle - and it's on fire." 

~ David Casey

9084 2018-01-28 18:47:38 Some people attest to their teeth  becoming whiter and overall healthier by applying coconut oil to their  teeth after they brush, and most people praise the results of oil  pulling.
9085 2018-01-28 18:47:24 Can it be true? Coconut oil to clean your teeth? Just when you thought you heard it all when it comes to coconut oil, along comes the news that coconut oil pulling can  serve as a natural teeth whitener.
9086 2018-01-28 18:47:22 You are NOT center left. You just THINK you're center left because Hillary claims to be center left and you believe in her Republican-lite agenda of imperialism, war for oil, and #SinglePayerNever.  That is NOT center left. Bernie Sanders is center-left.

9089 2018-01-28 18:47:14 Follow the money.
US national security forces are  “protecting” oil fields, opium farms, hubs for human trafficking, low cost work camps, ... 
for American businesses and mafia
9090 2018-01-28 18:47:10 What about Russian sanctions @SenJohnMcCain ? Isn’t tomorrow the deadline? What about the sanctioned Russian oil tanker off New England? P.S. I hope you’re feeling better and regaining your strength 
9091 2018-01-28 18:47:07 not trying to avoid oil, theyre trying to grow other things, like refined products. But that’s not relevant to IPO. $100B is not that much money for an investment fund. The public pension fund of the state of North Carolina is that amount. The Aramco IPO is not about the money
9092 2018-01-28 18:46:59 Scented Oil diffuser?
9093 2018-01-28 18:46:51 I’m no mechanic but I can change my oil.
9094 2018-01-28 18:46:44 it’s from dying my hair & then using a coconut oil shampoo & conditioner, it caused my hair to have build up from the oils in the shampoo & conditioner, but I used a clarifying shampoo last night to get rid of the build up and it worked
9095 2018-01-28 18:46:36 Have you a steamer? Something I often default to is:-
- Chopped sweet potato or squash (steam for 5-7 mins)
- Add salmon fillets (steam for further 5 mins)
- Add kale / other greens (steam for 3 mins)
- Crumble feta & pomegranate seeds
- Season: oil, salt, pepper, chilli, serve

9104 2018-01-28 18:45:25 I think it's all part of the same insular behaviour encouraged by Farage, Trump, et al to not believe in science and listen to Snake Oil Salesmen like Wakefield.
9105 2018-01-28 18:45:14 Oh OK
9106 2018-01-28 18:45:07 I really appreciate that! I too am hoping to ride this colony out until the update and probably restart then. Need to get going on all this oil stuff once I truly have this water situation sorted out.
9107 2018-01-28 18:45:06 Peanut oil ain't cheap either. The 24oz bottle i bought cost me a little over $7 with tax.
9108 2018-01-28 18:45:02 If you really cared about Muslims you could start with talking about Libya or Syria, were western powers have ripped apart those countries to steal their resources (Libya - gold + oil) or to lay down oil pipelines (Syria).

9112 2018-01-28 18:44:42 And my home state, Alaska, secedes. We have our own oil.
9113 2018-01-28 18:44:29 Well i would say start getting some baller power steering shit.  A cooler for the ps fluid.  When i re install my power steering ima run it through a cooler like my oil lines.
9114 2018-01-28 18:44:28 My parents are a blessing. They help me out so much. My mom who helped me out with school, and my dad who also did. My dad who showed me how to change a tire just so I won’t depend on no man and how to change oil, and my mom who gives me my tough as nails attitude. So many things
9115 2018-01-28 18:43:43 Sleeping oil it works everytime I use it.
9116 2018-01-28 18:43:37 Frozen dessert made w almond oil.
9117 2018-01-28 18:43:34 Man... coconut oil breaks my hair off and my skin not into much either. Although, I can use it if I double cleanse. Hmmm
9118 2018-01-28 18:43:21 What are you going on about? Russia is mostly a ressource extracting country, that is all. Just look at GDP/oil price graph.

Fuck NATO. If you love Russia, or just consider yourself a friend of the Russian people, you have to criticize the current regime.
9119 2018-01-28 18:43:20 Big ag is as corrupt as big oil and big pharma. Organic farms do not get government subsidies. Factory corporate farms do. It’s unfair from the get go. Enjoy eating your gmos and pesticides. I’ll pass.
9120 2018-01-28 18:43:15 Apples and oranges, Pat. Scottish oil is different, not like that Norwegian stuff. Too volatile, ran out 4 years ago (apparently) and can only be managed by Westminster.
9121 2018-01-28 18:43:13 Try to put tea tree oil in your hair products, shampoo m, hair oils etc.
9122 2018-01-28 18:43:13 @Vitaliy_Klychko interested in a multi million dollar deal via Ukraine sunflower oil ?
9123 2018-01-28 18:43:03 with the rise of international competition and globalization, plus the oil crisis. I'd still maintain that a part of the American Spirit/dream died in Dallas the day Kennedy got shot.
9124 2018-01-28 18:42:54 Oil @ $120 a barrel dropped to $28 but that had nothing to do with the collapse of the Venezuelan economy, same as the global financial crisis had nothing to do with the UK crash, it all socialism’s fault..... no wait 
9125 2018-01-28 18:42:53 I want to start doing this. Do you just apply it like a regular body oil?
9126 2018-01-28 18:42:48 What about those Russian  ships coming into US, full of oil and gas from already sanctioned companies?
9127 2018-01-28 18:42:44 Oil
Brent crude rose by US10 cents or 0.1% to US$70.52 a barrel. The US Nymex price rose by US63 cents or 1.0% to US$66.14 a barrel. Over the week Brent rose by 2.7% and Nymex rose by 4.3%.

If you get the first detection meter up half way then they come walk to check it out, and if you get it to the second meter they come running.

9132 2018-01-28 18:41:56 If you use petroleum products you are trashing mother earth! That the US depends less on foreign oil is a great thing! Sacrifices will cont. until new energy sources. Over population is what impacts all nature period! & POTUS does not discriminate against women, do more research!

9167 2018-01-28 18:37:28 Maybe the oil companies are afraid of these new types of Energy & that's why they get all defensive.

9181 2018-01-28 18:34:28 Exactly. I grew up on one coast and now live on the other. It breaks my heart that drilling is still in the conversation instead of maxing our investment and tech in clean energy. We don’t have to need the oil.
9182 2018-01-28 18:34:25 Lady trying to promote the essential oil that she is selling and she can't help but kept sniffing it like she's sniffing glue lmao at least it wasn't haram

9184 2018-01-28 18:34:07 What are the environmental costs of the oil industry that props up our equally worthless USD? When we lose world reserve status the dollar will be even more worthless and crypto will look that much better in comparison

9191 2018-01-28 18:33:09 It's extremely high on the comedogenic scale. It clogs pores badly for a lot of people bc of it being 4 on the comedogenic scale, including myself. It's also more of a sealant than a moisturizer. It's just sealing in what you've applied beforehand bc its an oil. Jojoba, Avocado
9192 2018-01-28 18:33:08 I don't even know what is that.
9193 2018-01-28 18:32:54 Oil prices are up 43% since Trudeau election.  TSX is up 18%.  
Imagine how bad it would be without the international commodities rebound.
9194 2018-01-28 18:32:34 the coconut oil from my hair got on my face last night and broke me out a little lol :(
9195 2018-01-28 18:32:25 I'd increase the garlic and onion content, and replace chicken with a good oil, argan, hemp or olive.
9196 2018-01-28 18:32:14 When doing the prep work for the pasta course use a razor blade to slice the garlic so thin that it will liquefy in the pan with just a little oil #ThingsILearnedFromTheMovies

9198 2018-01-28 18:32:06 Me cleaning w harsh chemical: we need to stay in the bedroom all day so we’re not breathing this too mucxh
Me cleanin w my oil mix: let me spray this in your mouth
9199 2018-01-28 18:31:59 I wonder if you melted it in the coffee if itd would be good. I've heard putting coconut oil in your coffee can be good for you
9200 2018-01-28 18:31:33 Oil PSI is perfect, no misfires. Code was related to a intermittent airbag circuit. I however am waiting for his timing chain to go if it leaks as bad as he claims it does once it's time for a oil change
9201 2018-01-28 18:31:31 No solar just oil say the Koch brothers. Stop them.
9202 2018-01-28 18:31:29 Someone once posted good results using the caivil hair growth oil.  Try that
9203 2018-01-28 18:31:19 Mr Pilot is premium engine oil something o.
9204 2018-01-28 18:31:14 Coconut oil is good for you if you use it properly. Y’all just sit in it and think all your problems will be solved.
9205 2018-01-28 18:30:40 Oregano oil drops under tongue until you cant stand it or 4 capsules in morning and 4 at night. Lots of h20. Watch Mindhunter on Netflix.

9207 2018-01-28 18:30:14 Coconut oil is a 3 out of 5 on the “comedenogenic scale” that measures how likely an oil is to clog your pores, 6 being most likely. Coconut oil clogs most pores. Not all, but even if it’s not causing break outs, it’s not benefiting your skin either.
9208 2018-01-28 18:30:00 además, claro, no pienso ahora, sino en un futuro no muy lejano, pero quiero hacer cosas randoms xD Por ejemplo, PASARME DE UNA VEZ EL NIVEL DE OIL OCEAN EN SONIC MANIA QUE SOY MALÍSIMA 
9209 2018-01-28 18:29:50 Like turning iron wire into musical steel string. Was there olive oil? (E8 Fromage)

9211 2018-01-28 18:29:36 My pilot quit and the damn things leaking oil!!!.... I can’t win!!!
9212 2018-01-28 18:29:13 White/pale friends--it's Sunday. Please spend at least 10 minutes moisturizing your body with your favorite lotion. Cuz I know y'all ain't done that this week.

I just put on some Bath and Body Works Almond and Olive oil lotion and I feel GODLY.

So go on. Do that now.
9213 2018-01-28 18:29:07 We did the same... but with new ducts and oil removal it’s about double what they quoted. (And they needed ducts too.)
9214 2018-01-28 18:28:59 Increase the share of Nuclear for base energy needs and increase the pipeline capacity to allow for cold weather needs. That would reduce the amount of oil burned
9215 2018-01-28 18:28:56 I lived in Canola for a while they’re very proud of their oil too
9216 2018-01-28 18:28:47 The futures contract pricing of crude oil is now in backwardation instead of contango.  Trump's economic policies are doomed.

9218 2018-01-28 18:28:13 We are one of the leading refractory companies in the oil and gas industries, at power plants, aluminium smelters and cement works.
9219 2018-01-28 18:28:13 While ole trumpy is a puppet to the oil gods. Trump is trash!
9220 2018-01-28 18:27:55 When it comes to coconut oil idk what to believe anymore
9221 2018-01-28 18:27:45 I can imagine all the wear that engine has, especially with the seals leaking.  Code probably something specific to either misfiring, or low oil pressure.
9222 2018-01-28 18:27:41 trump bought off Murkowski on health care. Imagine she can easily be bought off by trump and oil.
9223 2018-01-28 18:27:40 every time money gets tight my car flashes its little red triangle light at me with attitude like hello yes have you ever heard of an oil change
9224 2018-01-28 18:27:39 If your skin care routine has shea moisture black soap, or coconut oil in it please keep it to yourself

9227 2018-01-28 18:27:01  it’s pore clogging for most. But even it it doesn’t clog pores it’s not the most beneficial oil for the face. Try almond oil, jojoba oil, rosehip oil, maracuja oil, or argan oil.
9228 2018-01-28 18:26:55 I have seen 2 fire brigade trucks at Oil Libya headed there.
9229 2018-01-28 18:26:28 Dasani water tastes like oil
9230 2018-01-28 18:26:05 yeah, the oil apparently breaks down in stomach in a way that doesn't get the CBD into bloodstream. That's why I stick with the gummies.
9231 2018-01-28 18:26:03 The real rulers of Nigeria are the oil companies. The rest are all slaves.
9232 2018-01-28 18:26:03 I’m so freaking excited about this project. Thanks for making a delightful thing. And also olive oil.

9234 2018-01-28 18:25:43 Yooo I just switched back to oil cleansing after using wipes for a while and it is superior in every way.
9235 2018-01-28 18:25:37 Perhaps not oil, but bulk milk carriers?

9238 2018-01-28 18:25:17 In a pinch, Nutella can be used as a substitute for motor oil. #FakeNutellaFacts
9239 2018-01-28 18:25:17 They will, but i doubt if it will be in 2018. IPO is a part of a longer term plan and it will give the government an access to capital markets, especially if one-day the government decided to get red of its oil giant, since listing Aramco at $20 a barrel won't be feasible at all
9240 2018-01-28 18:25:16 I think imma try rose water or tea tree oil.  I already moisturize with Shea butter.
9241 2018-01-28 18:25:03 They haven't won anything. Not a single trophie after spending over 400 million, but look at the English press money beggers. Oil money is doing a well done job.
9242 2018-01-28 18:24:42 So I hardly ever wear makeup anymore and as soon as I do it makes my skin so oily. Oil pulling mask will be applied tonight.
9243 2018-01-28 18:24:42 A lot of this reasoning came from when auto manufacturers were pushing the whole 100,000 mile tuneup thing in the late 90's and early 2000's.  Made people think that cars didn't need an oil change until then.
9244 2018-01-28 18:24:32 ネットで誰でも普通に話し掛けに行ける人は凄いと思う、私色々考えてしまってテンションが上がってる時以外無理やもん
9245 2018-01-28 18:24:30 There is an oil film on the road that stretches all the way down to Rainier Ave. It almost made me loose control of the car. Be careful.
9246 2018-01-28 18:24:28 In Alberta it pushed universities into the control of "patrons" (e.g. the oil patch downtown in YYC) who would fund programs they wanted, and put pressure on to block anything "controversial" that might upset their wagon.
9247 2018-01-28 18:24:15 Modern day shamans or "snake oil" salesmen. They have brainwashed people in the 21st Century folks. This is not a joke. #ProsperityGospel is sick to say the least. It is like the bible of the devil.
9248 2018-01-28 18:24:15 don’t use coconut oil on your face.... teatree oil is better

9250 2018-01-28 18:24:00 same for RF. Maybe a barrel of oil instead of canned fish.
9251 2018-01-28 18:24:00 I bought tea tree oil yesterday, and this morning I woke up with a pimple on my forehead... perfect timing
9252 2018-01-28 18:23:47 I change the oil twice a year in my vehicles because I rarely drive over 7500 miles a year.  (Sometimes once, if I only go 5000 miles in that year)

9258 2018-01-28 18:22:32 Nectar has oil for dabbing and oil for cartridges! $15 a gram for the dabs, $29 a gram for the cartridge. Prices before tax.

9260 2018-01-28 18:22:04 their crippled economy has also added to the worries. increase in oil prices has hit them. diesel stock 17 day petrol stock 9 days. they r really scared that india has make alive larger part of LOC, from where will they bring money if india prolongs the tension. pak gone J&K cool
9261 2018-01-28 18:21:51 I hope you get free oil changes since you blasting me

9263 2018-01-28 18:21:18 This Con-Snake-Oil Sales-Demon is never arguing. Argument requires mutual equitable thought. He wants to inflict pain in some form upon all who dare disagree. America is watching a replay of the abuse he probably suffered during his formative years.

9265 2018-01-28 18:21:08 Butter was one of the toughest things to let go, but rest assured there are delicious and often creative replacements!

Instead of buttering my toast, for example, I'm hooked on sesame oil—gives the bread a sesame seed bagel flavor!!
9266 2018-01-28 18:21:04 When I worked as s baker in a donut shop (not Tim’s), we also had dough in a turning crank hopper and we’d dispense the dough into the hot oil that way.

9270 2018-01-28 18:20:47 lifehack: add just a lil bit of coconut oil to your coffee, because you can't for the life of you keep track of chapstick, and this will at least ensure that your lips are moisturized and soft 
9271 2018-01-28 18:20:34 Yeah two million because the oil companies don't want to be sued because the workers are such a liability
9272 2018-01-28 18:20:23 Shut up and quit lying ... you change your own oil now ??
9273 2018-01-28 18:20:20 The curls are natural lol, i just use water and coconut oil lol

9276 2018-01-28 18:20:04 I need a nice deep condition and hot oil treatment
9277 2018-01-28 18:19:43 「幸せに死ぬ」という概念が好きすぎる
本来生物として忌避すべき「死」と歓迎すべき「幸福」が合体している矛盾 完全なる死への恐怖の克服だし、残された側としての読者が一切同情や悼みが不要なのがやばい。祝福しなきゃ これは門出 彼らは幸福な世界に旅立ったのだ(錯乱)

9289 2018-01-28 18:18:39 The vagina 
The best engine in the world is vagina. It can be started with one finger. It is self lubricating. It takes any size piston and it change its own oil every 4 weeks. It is pity though that the managment system is so fucking temperamented.
9290 2018-01-28 18:18:36 Thanks girl! I just started using coocnut oil bc i ran out of my makeup removing balm sooo maybe I’ll try something else just in case 
9291 2018-01-28 18:18:36 My oil change was scheduled for 12 and they just brought my car in 
9292 2018-01-28 18:18:01 China can print CNY for oil & other critical commodity imports & settle in physical gold; fr 1945-3q14 the US was the only nation that could do so.  Huge change, huge implications for FX flows in next crisis.
9293 2018-01-28 18:17:59 Did we progress any faster when your party and  kinsman was president for six to  sixteen years?  They rewarded us by plunging us into a recession after an extensive period of oil boom through gross mismanagement and failing  to diversify the economy? Did we have leaders then?
9294 2018-01-28 18:17:48 Raw castor oil IS THE PLUG.
9295 2018-01-28 18:17:48  you should’ve! It’s a mix of nourishing oils that heal & perfect the skin. Vitamin E Oil + Geranium Oil are the two that do the most work along with a little Jojoba Oil

They hate Borat.

9332 2018-01-28 18:14:07 Data is the new oil. Whoever can drill for it, own the access to it and refine it, wins. Amazon is essentially the state owned oil companies who own their own crude, drill for it and profit from it. Hegemony beckons.

9340 2018-01-28 18:13:14 I'm also pretty sure that workers in the oil industry would take some offense at your pretentious dismissal of what they do as "grunt work". It's hard work, which is why you sniff at it, but it's also very specialized.

9344 2018-01-28 18:13:00 I’ve started taking peppermint oil- I took one before my dinner and I literally feel like I’m eating mint for Dinner
9345 2018-01-28 18:12:56 I would not use coconut oil on your hair because it will cause a protein buildup which can only cause the hair to become even more stiff and brittle. This will cause the hair to lose its elasticity. It’s better to just invest in a good deep conditioner from your local salon.
9346 2018-01-28 18:12:46 Yo why did my coworker say the same thing. Her husband is an oil field worker 
9347 2018-01-28 18:12:46 - Maaaaan over here spending a arm n leg to get my car oil changed + full service ...  Only the best for my baby tho . 
9348 2018-01-28 18:12:31 No one single transfer or incident tells you everything about them. Was Salah or VVD forced down Klopps throat as a cheap option. They always reinvest the player sales. Fans aren’t happy because we aren’t oil rich.
9349 2018-01-28 18:12:19 Where’d you get the avocado oil?
9350 2018-01-28 18:12:17 At first I thought "oh she's just worried about how much sugar is in the spread" but upon further inspection it seems like she's grossed out by palm oil?
9351 2018-01-28 18:12:16 Oil prices are rising, yes, but Canadian oil is heavily discounted (by more than 40% to the U.S. benchmark grade) due to lack of access to international markets. The eco activists have done a great job demonizing one source of oil: Alberta's. Everyone else is off the hook.
9352 2018-01-28 18:12:15 Well change the oil and it might work
9353 2018-01-28 18:11:57 Stop doing tadka on all your sabjis.  Use water instead of oil for your piyaj tadka.
9354 2018-01-28 18:11:47 Guys donnnnnnt put coconut oil on your face it is comedogenic meaning it clogs your pores!! Stop stop stop
9355 2018-01-28 18:11:44 Anything coconut oil can do another oil can do better 
9356 2018-01-28 18:11:40 Don’t you have some snake oil to sell?

9367 2018-01-28 18:09:10 That's why I said coconut oil is not always good. If you put in your ends it's fine. That's where the hair needs it the most if its chemically prossessed. It's not good at all to put it in the scalp because you are right it will clog up your pores and hair follicles.
9368 2018-01-28 18:09:05 Unsa olive oil....mantika ra pang gisa...kay barato ra...
9369 2018-01-28 18:09:02 Coconut oil on your hair is ridiculous I don’t know how or why some of you do it.
9370 2018-01-28 18:09:01 It's very much illegal in my state. They also have outlawed CBD oil here. My state is stuck in the 1920s. I would kill to use medical marijuana, trust me. And to smoke illegally could cause me to lose the pain meds I *do* have.
9371 2018-01-28 18:09:01 Yes, this is white privilege.  Look what happened when Indian tribe tried to protect their land from being trashed by the oil Co.
9372 2018-01-28 18:09:00 I was going to chew on broken glass and wash it down with used car oil. #morepleasant

9374 2018-01-28 18:08:43 Aye, the ziggy zaggy thing it's sitting by in the water is the Hound Point terminal - which is linked to the onshore oil storage tanks you can see in top right of the picture. 

Supertankers capable of carrying up to 2m barrels of crude can load there - biggest NSea terminal

9377 2018-01-28 18:08:23 Even Rafa would have had more grand slams at Wimbledon had federer not been around . He lost twice to Federer in the final there 

As of now ,he 's behind fed but u never know . He might be 2nd greatest player ever

9380 2018-01-28 18:07:34 I love watching both of them, and have probably been more awed by Rafa at his best. Certain shots nobody else can pull off. Same goes for Djokovic from 11-16. But Roger's longevity is a marvel in itself. Also, as I said earlier, Rafa is a matchup nightmare for Fed's backhand
9381 2018-01-28 18:07:33 U try coconut oil?
9382 2018-01-28 18:07:25 ARAMCO IPO is never going to happen. The higher the oil price, the less we’ll hear about it. They just said their foreign reserves are up in December.

If they do the IPO, it should stay within Saudi and owned by Saudis. Let’s not kid ourselves: The economy still depends on oil.
9383 2018-01-28 18:07:20 Flora Dairy Free. 'Our Vegan seed oil blend' is 59% rapeseed and palm oil. :(
9384 2018-01-28 18:07:14 when i play MG with LA and if there any player join our game that isn't friends i would pissed him off by oil traps locking him up like a jail guy xD idk the full game have more options so we see what new
9385 2018-01-28 18:07:10 “Get you that guy from the oil fields, if something happens to him, you get the check” Jesus
9386 2018-01-28 18:06:30 When you have to buy both the dewy and matte foundations bc your nose is a desert and your cheeks are the actual product of an oil spill.... 

(Anybody else with combo skin seems to have the exact opposite problem )
9387 2018-01-28 18:06:18 ぼく男の子同士の友達関係だいすき
9388 2018-01-28 18:06:05 I guess #FloraDairyFree in the UK is aimed at those vegans who don't give a crap about animals and the environment? 59% palm oil!!!!
9389 2018-01-28 18:05:58 Did they create oil, natural resources and available labour and markets all by themselves? Did they create society all alone?
9390 2018-01-28 18:05:50 But that also goes both ways. And Djokovic's dominance from 2011-16 adds another ripple to the story
9391 2018-01-28 18:05:14 It means that Federer has been better across all surfaces for a longer period of time than Rafa. Rafa has been a wall at the French that Federer could never break down. But Roger would have way more than 1 French Open if Rafa weren't a god on clay.
9392 2018-01-28 18:05:13 there's no correlation whatsoever between your success as an actor and your grandfather's involvement in the oil industry but haters gonna hate no matter what
9393 2018-01-28 18:05:04 @ktla Girl scout cookies support  unsustainable palm oil production destroying rainforest and putting orangutans lives in peril. #justsaynotogirlscoutcookies
9394 2018-01-28 18:04:59 Ai jameni....ati melting oil  drums. These #KOT streets are not for the weak. Lol
9395 2018-01-28 18:04:41 You must be serious? Late cycle global EM and DM growth-> demand is there. US shale production overstated and Saudis subdue. True near term headwinds of refinery througput but next 2 years oil will crush it.
9396 2018-01-28 18:04:39 whats your take on Soma oil and Gas ?
9397 2018-01-28 18:04:36 Cup need a oil change

9401 2018-01-28 18:04:18 People suggest using another oil like baobab oil or avocado oil.
9402 2018-01-28 18:03:47 Nice one, I’ll bring wine, baby oil and my best of Barry White ;)
9403 2018-01-28 18:03:43 I don’t buy into the whole thing. Mediums and snake oil and whatnot. But I do appreciate the clean skin care/beauty products, healthy recipes, and some of the wellness tips.
9404 2018-01-28 18:03:40 The globalist keep damn near the whole continent of Africa at a simmer ! With dictators and civil war constantly, rebels, terrorism, they don’t want it stable. If it was stable they wouldn’t be able to go in and rob the natural resources, gold diamonds, silver, copper, oil.
9405 2018-01-28 18:03:35 I don't think it's the fact that it has multiple parts, but rather the sheer volume of sugar and palm oil. I dunno why everyone's giving them so much shit for this lol
9406 2018-01-28 18:03:14 Assuming you have asked if it can be changed or is that what you were offered? Is it a big company so like turning an oil tanker to get change?

9428 2018-01-28 18:00:46 @TigerTalkback the U.S should expand offshore drilling for oil because we'd have more oil so it'd lower oil prices

9434 2018-01-28 18:00:21 It needed more oil, either way PTA is awesome
9435 2018-01-28 18:00:17 Believe me I get where you are coming from but just don't agree w/ the surface argument as Rafa has beat him with regularity on all surfaces but indoors and is 1-2 on grass. As of this moment Federer is GOAT but if Nadal can win a few more he makes it interesting.

9440 2018-01-28 17:59:38 Trump's destruction of the US government helps Putin every day. Making America weaker. Crushing our State Department. Alienating our NATO and other global allies. Weakening our environmental regulations for big oil. Weakening our economy with damaging tax cuts. Weakening our DOJ.
9441 2018-01-28 17:59:33 not for turnaround maintainance but lack of crude in an oil producing nation. What a shame
9442 2018-01-28 17:59:24 Con el oil a 19 ya tuvistes chance suficiente, pienso q para q sea valida esa previsión, debes establecer una ventana d tiempo y ya han pasado demasiados meses desde q dijistes q eso sucedería.

9444 2018-01-28 17:59:04 All I’m worried about is the capability & legitimacy of soma oil,it’s been probed by the UN & the uk corruption...also the owners are well known cartels,ENI recently decided not to work with them because of the corruption scandals
9445 2018-01-28 17:58:51 I need to get up and get an oil change and car wash, but instead I continue to lay down and watch Hell’s Kitchen 
9446 2018-01-28 17:58:50 Sir where is the Vikas... I am not finding any kind of vikas as we expect before election n I know on paper u did great job.But ground level story is totally different, still road is not good even NH for ghazipur .Near by jhunjhunu oil mil, is full of dust.And giving breath issue
9447 2018-01-28 17:58:18 Agreed DC is filled with Mentaly ill @TheDemocrats Hopefully one day it will be cleaned out.

9448 2018-01-28 17:58:05 cut prices,oil lanes fairly,scratch and handicap leagues so each bowler is in with bowlers of his own skill
9449 2018-01-28 17:57:49 i know olive oil and coconut oil aren’t good but what’s wrong with rose water or witch hazel? i’ve never tried them but wanted to
9450 2018-01-28 17:57:48 Unfortunately made predominantly from palm oil! Which they don't brag about on the front! Terrible deforestation and stuff the orang-utans!
9451 2018-01-28 17:57:47 Is coconut oil Really good to use on the face?
9452 2018-01-28 17:57:42 Those attacking Barbz just need prayer and some anointing oil
9453 2018-01-28 17:57:42 Wassup with y’all hating coconut oil
9454 2018-01-28 17:57:25 These two oil patch boys so excited for their whip cream drenched breakfasts taking photos of them for insta while exclaiming “WOWWWW WOOOOWWWWWWW” is such a blessed start to my day
9455 2018-01-28 17:57:22 God uses the analogy of the yoke to show how certain additions, sicknesses, and conditions are controlling your life. He's provided the anointing oil to pull off the yoke and destroy it.  - @PastorMattHagee #AnointingService
9456 2018-01-28 17:57:10 Our genius thinks he'll have world dominance with oil, won't  impose sanctions, Putin knows he's a fool, and meanwhile, he's destroying our environment and world health.
9457 2018-01-28 17:57:05 ...nah coconut oil is just not meant to be on the face lol literally clogs the pores and sits on top of the skin
9458 2018-01-28 17:57:03 You're killing the solar panels industry which enployees more than coil and oil together. AND killing the environment destroying what you're to preserve

9461 2018-01-28 17:56:12 @realdonaldtrump Turkey is our ally.  Why are Turkish troops fighting our troops to keep United States from building another oil pipeline?  Are we going to witness another #DAPL on Turkey's border? #NoDAPLinTurkey
9462 2018-01-28 17:56:07 would add rise in investment in tight oil to the set of causes.  tends to use a lot of domestic manufactures
9463 2018-01-28 17:55:55 Another fair point. My point was that the only argument for Rafa as GOAT is H2H with RF, and it's not as lopsided as it's made out to be. Rafa is the best clay court player of all time, and over a third of their meetings have come on clay
9464 2018-01-28 17:55:54 Hate changing my oil

9471 2018-01-28 17:54:33 I have mixed feelings while finding out palm oil is one of the ingredients in my thin mints. On the box, #GirlScouts image promoting community gardens. I'm wondering if they are really worried about #environment or just don't know the dark truth about #PalmOil

9472 2018-01-28 17:54:22 I bought a huge ass bottle of argan oil for my frizzy hair for almost RM90 SO THIS BETTER WORK
9473 2018-01-28 17:54:18 Bought by Mark Hughes with the Chinese/sheikh/oil money. Not before the rise he was one of the first show off signings. Trying to rewrite history to paint Manchester City as a good team before the money should always be called out
9474 2018-01-28 17:54:17 You had nothing to do with President Obama’s economy.  You are ballooning the budget deficit and the National debt. 1000s have lost their health insurance. The environment is in jeopardy because of your alignment with oil companies. Your a fraud.
9475 2018-01-28 17:54:00 @garbage oh man, so much to say so little room. Oil of oregano & thieves oil I can’t recommend enough!! They have properties to help fight the virus and are also a great preventative at the first sign of symptoms in the future. Feel better!

9477 2018-01-28 17:53:55 When did I say that?

9480 2018-01-28 17:53:43 Someone’s wcw is talking about how coconut oil needs to be unrefined for it to help your acne, which is again, false
9481 2018-01-28 17:53:42 Empty news being used to deflect from life’s realities.... like Trump colluding with the Russians-and covering it up .... like you being a horrible parent. How is Tracks ankle monitor holding up ? A little olive oil goes a long way Track !
9482 2018-01-28 17:53:42 How do you reach the point that your car breaks down because you’re out of oil? Come on, fam.
9483 2018-01-28 17:53:28 Reading and comprehension for a prejudiced mind is like water and oil...no meeting point.
9484 2018-01-28 17:53:20 pep's style is to spend spend spend, since coming to city pep has spent 380 million on a team that already had aguero, sterling, de bruyner, silva.
in any case city's mvp is the arab with the oil, no arab no city
9485 2018-01-28 17:53:15 Yea motor oil is a bit tough to take down 
9486 2018-01-28 17:53:14 Yep We are backed by the petro dollar.  Anyone sells oil in other currency besides the US dollar gets a can of democracy opened on them

9489 2018-01-28 17:53:03 For sure but also remember those numbers include a 5-1 edge for Roger indoors...where you can make the argument he's as dominant as Nadal on clay.
9490 2018-01-28 17:53:00 That’s not the point of the original tweet. That was all my comment was based on. People were misreading it and thinking the point was that City don’t spend money. Human rights, Oil, morals etc. have nothing to do with this particular argument
9491 2018-01-28 17:52:46 I used to clean and change generator plug that year. Use petrol to clean plug. Change engine oil. Replace bulbs....

With my mom, you live like you may never have a man around you.
9492 2018-01-28 17:52:44 "Ken Ham speaks to teens", because most adults are way too intelligent to buy his snake oil.

There are some exceptions, of course ...
9493 2018-01-28 17:52:44 Only use UNREFINED on your entire body. You ain’t a piece of food ready to be fried. Don’t ever use refined coconut oil on your skin. That’s how ya get burns
9494 2018-01-28 17:52:42 The thing is Dr Özkan, the world saw this "barbaric terror org" Heroically fight isis, while Turkey was boosting isis, by buying their stolen oil, and offering free transit for their fighters... In reality, it's erdogan's regime that is a barbaric terror org, not the YPG..
9495 2018-01-28 17:52:38 I change oil in lawnmowers for a living. So according to MSM logic I should help you with your taxes!
9496 2018-01-28 17:52:38 where are the ones explored. NNPC is not serious With local refining of oil.

9519 2018-01-28 17:48:59 In slams, you're absolutely correct. And I don't intend to discredit Rafa with the argument. I was referring more to the overall H2H, which Federer leads 13-10 on other surfaces, where Rafa leads 13-2 on clay.
9520 2018-01-28 17:48:54 Oh I did that with a toothbrush once trying to get coconut oil out of a canvas shoe
9521 2018-01-28 17:48:53 Oklahoma residents had some of the same problems. Like the Dutch, citizens complained about man-made earthquakes, but couldn't get authorities and the oil and gas industry to do anything.

9524 2018-01-28 17:48:15 The Russialicon Party is all tied up in Russian oil and money-laundering. They will never enforce sanctions. What a treasonous bunch of turds.
9525 2018-01-28 17:48:08 That oil barrel comparison actually puts in perspective just how stupidly energy-dense oil actually is. To think you can (on paper) run your entire apartment for almost a month on a single barrel of liquid.
9526 2018-01-28 17:47:59 Lmao I've actually used coconut oil on my face and never got acne. For two whole years. Don't think she's lying. I think it's coz my fave is already oily so ja

9538 2018-01-28 17:45:42 That makes sense but people like to believe everything that’s why snake oil salesman were a big thing back in the day.

9542 2018-01-28 17:45:33 If I'm not mistaken, Federer beat Rafa three times at slams...twice at Wimbledon and once in Australia. Nadal has beat him nine times... five at Roland Garros, once at Wimbledon and three times in Australia. Imo, the clay argument holds no water.
9543 2018-01-28 17:45:27 I continue, one barell of oil is aprox 159 ltrs of petrol.,it works out to be aproc 26 per litre after tefining it workd out to be

9554 2018-01-28 17:43:38 Your support of @POTUS is weak at best.

He's made some decisions in favor of the oil & gas industry that I don't like, but I still support him 100% because he's currently our only shot at imploding corruptions w/in our governments.

9578 2018-01-28 17:39:59 He seemed to suggest that Venezuela had spent the oil money (doing Socialist things) instead of investing it. Which in effect is Capitalism.

9600 2018-01-28 17:36:52 What? Are you serious? My friend, this is what the italian olive oil industry is based on since forever. Buying cheap olive oil from all over the med., cutting it with a small % of ital. oil and reselling it under ital. labels. In this case, idignation has gone the wrong way.

9610 2018-01-28 17:35:09 If it’s pure olive oil then it isn’t very comedogenic, but most oils like that are sealants and don’t penetrate far enough to actually moisturize. If you’re looking for a good moisturizer you should check out @BahiCosmetics sunflower serum!! The owner is an esthetician

9618 2018-01-28 17:34:27 Corporate news media is thick as thieves with the globalists.  The entire reason Turkey gets away with all this is lucrative business contracts.  That's the reality, Kurds lives don't matter vs. oil pipelines and weapons shipments.

9623 2018-01-28 17:33:45 I fry them in olive oil, and yes
9624 2018-01-28 17:33:40 Curry is the best food, but it's even better with chili oil.

9626 2018-01-28 17:33:38 Here is another way you are the same. You both deny science and need to watch Bill Nye "Saves The World" just to get a clue because David Suzuki is to deep for your understanding. Conservatives kill us with their love of oil.
9627 2018-01-28 17:33:34 Tell me, what does Trump care about American Farmers..he sold them a bottle of snake oil too.

9629 2018-01-28 17:33:12 ... And both to be taken out into the sun and anointed with oil daily to clean & prepare for proper worship. To bring something to cover their eyes  & only upon all people free from bond to another. The Altar produces water and seed that appear as gold in the sun...
9630 2018-01-28 17:33:05 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
9631 2018-01-28 17:33:01 Ppl keep calling out coconut oil as cooking oil (which it is) like olive oil, avocado and grape-seed oil also can’t be used in cooking...
9632 2018-01-28 17:32:59 Rumour has it they were producing cannabis oil, which requires vast amounts of butane gas. Hence the explosion
9633 2018-01-28 17:32:43 Because Corbyn was advocating it as a way to run the UK. His blueprint is flawed. As oil rich Venezuela ran out of money he is advocating we now borrow billions to buy a postal company.
9634 2018-01-28 17:32:36 It is funny how the perception of a player changes w/ the surface he's won on. Lendl being the best example. Doesn't get the credit he deserves b/c no Wimbledon but actually had some good runs on the surface.
9635 2018-01-28 17:32:32 Don’t forget that viruses settle on the spine so you better rub some cinnamon oil on that shit
9636 2018-01-28 17:32:20 All this coconut oil talk and they’re all refusing to educate you that UNREFINED coconut oil is the most pure and raw. Unbleached therefore it actually has the absorption/clearing properties that are good for hair and skin...
9637 2018-01-28 17:32:14 Also just remembered I was talking to someone pretty cool last night and I asked them what they did and they said they worked in Big Oil and I just yelled YOU’RE THE DEVIL at them
9638 2018-01-28 17:31:38 Oil exploration puts you in some remote places, and they needed a ladder, that stayed on-board for use at airports that don't have jetways.
9639 2018-01-28 17:31:34 @timesofindia @OfficeOfRG be practical if a person sells pakoda & get Rs. 200 at end of day that person is going to shut business soon since that person need raw material stove oil and lots of things to make it & rent to land too unless Modiji is talking about illegal hawkers
9640 2018-01-28 17:30:59 GOP refused to back Obama’s proposals for Infrastructure bills . At the time Obama proposals , jobs would help some of the “ forgotten man” A gas tax more feasible because of cheap oil at time . GOP refused b/c of deficit.
9641 2018-01-28 17:30:59 USA exports more oil and gas while prices increase for all USA citizens. Check grocery produce and beef prices USA exports. The stock market swims in new unregulated markets.
9642 2018-01-28 17:30:50 Oy. The oppressive regime is the PA that does not take care of their own citizens. We have a small piece of land with no oil. Your sound bytes don’t work anymore. The world is watching. Take care. Glad we can respectfully disagree
9643 2018-01-28 17:30:50 .@CENTCOM @CJTFOIR are allowing #Turkey to force #SDF to redeploy from ERV to #Afrin. A strategic victory for #ISIS that, with #Hezbollah, can then occupy the oil fields.

9646 2018-01-28 17:30:40 Prophet Isaiah said, "The yoke will be broken by the oil." Normally, soft fat of an animal's back is worn off by the hard yoke that rubs on it; this time the strong yoke of Sancheriv would be broken by oil that Chizkiyahu & the Jewish people burnt staying up late & studying Torah
9647 2018-01-28 17:30:10 Absolutes are very expensive because the process is usually for flowers formally used to make perfume: rose, neroli, jasmine, gardenia, tuberose, etc. Lots of flowers are needed to get oil from.

9654 2018-01-28 17:29:07 You’re brainwashed because you stated only 2% of scientists disagreee and they all work for oil companies. Both of which are rubbish and would only be stated by someone who’s brainwashed to ignore anyone who disagrees
9655 2018-01-28 17:29:04 Have we not learnt anything false propaganda  was the start of the Nazi and divide and rule it what the British Commonwealth did for oil to India  thanks to Churchill when they left and it's still happening WAIT UP PEOPLE

9665 2018-01-28 17:28:02 The epitome of hypocrisy. Slow down oil production and face higher prices & shortages in fertilizer, plastics, polyester clothing (gore would suggest grow more sheep or go naked). Also, pharmaceuticals, jet fuel, diesel, farming costs would soar. Did Gore ever eat Soylent Green?
9666 2018-01-28 17:27:57 i'm pretty sure she just thinks having "oil" in her food is gross but yeah ur right no matter what you choose to eat someone's getting stepped on somewhere down the line

9671 2018-01-28 17:27:38 It sucks how often the response to: 

“does the billionaire you admire invest in weapons and oil?” 

is:

“yes, but so does your 401K”
9672 2018-01-28 17:27:35 You can't possibly think Trump is concerned how the wall could effect Native Americans. The whole concept of a wall is medieval and ludicrous. Determined people will find another way! Are you going to wall off the entire coast? Maybe you could use adjacent oil rigs!
9673 2018-01-28 17:27:34 Nigeria has a much larger population and a big oil deposit which is the biggest export product yet funny enough they have a shortage of fuel they dnt refine. 

TANZANIA IS EASIER TO DO BUSINESS THAN MOST AFRICAN COUNTRIES. End of discussion.

9684 2018-01-28 17:26:25 Even more related to oil then. Inflation expectations are 100% driven by oil. Compare BEI to change in crude.

9686 2018-01-28 17:26:16 Massage the scalp. Apply less oil on complete layers, so that it’s not too “liquid”. Then make a bun and lie on a pillow overnight.
9687 2018-01-28 17:26:14 Turm oil???? Low unemployment low taxes record setting economy isis almost eliminated?? Things look good to me
9688 2018-01-28 17:26:12 Idk most of this is utterly ridiculous but the palm oil makes me sad but at the same time, there's no ethical consumption under capitalism
9689 2018-01-28 17:26:02 Californians that use oil - and we do - should man up to help produce it. Sen. Feinstein is the ultimate NIMBY - wants the oil we need but let all the costs and risks of producing it be borne by others. This is immoral.

9904 2018-01-28 17:01:51 I highly recommend olive oil choux pastry! I've enjoyed many a full-butter profiterole in Italy, and the #EVOO recipe can really compete. Recipe for that coming soon...
9905 2018-01-28 17:01:44 I'm turning into a lesbian. Can't watch how AK 47 is made, biggest oil rig in the world, difference between hp and torque, etc. on a continuous play.
9906 2018-01-28 17:01:34 And Russia will have their way with oil drilling off coast of Ukraine (Exxon=Putin/Tillerson) among other things.
9907 2018-01-28 17:01:32 idk but she can eat a book tbh considering it’s probably the only thing oil free enough for her to eat
9908 2018-01-28 17:01:21 Looks like he bought the  oil.
9909 2018-01-28 17:01:16 BUT once it's diluted, it can work miracles on problem areas and help reduce swelling/redness/pore size/oil buildup. It can even help razor bumps/burns when it's diluted.
9910 2018-01-28 17:01:10 LOL “where can I find a gallon of lavender essential oil”
9911 2018-01-28 17:01:10 Why not call the WORK CAMPS. Ford supplied the engines, Rockefeller's Standard OIL the fuel. IG Farben and IBM made good money. WW2 = An American business venture by the Rothschilds.

9913 2018-01-28 17:01:06 Trump isn't smart enough to understand. He just wants to pump oil out as fast as possible to make friends richer, and do away with renewable energy, wind and solar. Our President is the village idiot #amJoy #reiders
9914 2018-01-28 17:00:57 A recently introduced bill in #Idaho would allow residents to use oil extracted from #cannabis plants as long as the product is prescribed by a licensed practitioner. #CBD #EVIOLABS $EVIO #CannabisTesting
9915 2018-01-28 17:00:54 Hahaha I’m always afraid there embers will catch a drop of oil from my engine and blow me up.
9916 2018-01-28 17:00:35 Alberta's Heritage Fund was such a good idea that Norway copied it when they discovered oil in the North Sea. The UK also was involved in that particular boom.

So look at how the 3 governments handled it...

9921 2018-01-28 17:00:08 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.
9922 2018-01-28 17:00:05 I remember when i use to sleep with baby oil, coconut oil, Vaseline etc on my face and nothing would ever happened i just thought it was a normal thing to do and it made your skin soft 
9923 2018-01-28 17:00:04 I’ll take a wild stab in the dark. Oil and the global banking elite.
9924 2018-01-28 17:00:03 Tea tree oil is really good for acne spot treatment when it's diluted! Make sure it's diluted though! Tea tree oil is an EXTREMELY strong astringent and will irritate, burn, and dry out your face to hell if it's not diluted. And it's only for spot treatment, not the whole face!
9925 2018-01-28 17:00:02 @MarthaRaddatz #ThisWeekABC @realDonaldTrump Did Mathew D. really say if it wasn’t for oil, immigrants, and air conditioning, there wouldn’t be a Texas??!!

9931 2018-01-28 16:58:33 1. My take: You have multi-billion lobby groups at both ends - #Oil-lobby versus #GreenEnergy-lobby. I think both are selling "their solution".
What we need: Real #science, real facts & base decisions on them only & not on the "O" or "G" lobby-points.

9945 2018-01-28 16:57:05 What’s a good natural oil or moisturizer I can use in my hair everyday?

9947 2018-01-28 16:56:58 Palm oil is used in processed foods. True health conscious vegans would not consume palm oil based products any more than they would refined sugar.
9948 2018-01-28 16:56:49 When moisturizing with cocoa butter baby oil gel, I think it's obligatory to dance in the mirror like a 90's video vixen. The glistening and shimmering be so real 
9949 2018-01-28 16:56:38 So happy to hear that Herbalism works well for you sweets! The chlorophyllin (which also gives it the green colour) is not only nourishing to the skin, but also helps to balance out the skin's oil production for long term results! 
9950 2018-01-28 16:56:31 Some black folks need omega 3 as we come from places where ppl consumed a lot of fish. Simply taking fish oil will make your skin nicer,hair longer and life longer.
9951 2018-01-28 16:56:13 Maybe the palm oil and where it comes from (85% of world‘s production comes from Malaysia and Indonesia,  according to Wikipedia). #deforestation #rainforest #asia

9953 2018-01-28 16:56:10 "Brain Octane Oil" sounds like a concoction you'd see in a late-night infomercial on a low-rent tv station that plays right before one for pills that guarantee a 4" increase in 'organ' size.
9954 2018-01-28 16:55:50 He's doing it to appease his oil executive buddies. Can't have all this 'clean energy' crap going on and threatening oil profits now can we?
9955 2018-01-28 16:55:47 Air conditioning, oil, immigrants, and guns. Don't forget guns!

9957 2018-01-28 16:55:27 Right, also look up what palm oil cultivation does to Orangutans, I got too nauseated to even post a link.

£10,000,000,000

THAT'S how much we give the EU annually in net budget payments. Think about that, next time you buy EU-subsidised French cheese, Danish bacon, Italian olive oil.

We give €6bn a year to the EU CAP, just €3bn is returned.

10005 2018-01-28 16:50:47 Money obviously played a factor, as did being the 1st player to go in wearing an Angeles cap...which will also lead to more cash. I'm with  you, it should be an Expos cap but the production is fairly close.
10006 2018-01-28 16:50:45 OG post “I think it’s the oil that did it for me.” BRUH most spreads need an oil in it to make it that spread-worthy consistency????
10007 2018-01-28 16:50:34 Need to go get my oil changed.  I wonder if they’ll fill up my tank too.
10008 2018-01-28 16:50:31 KSA is a closer ally of the US than Iran – which is trying to encircle KSA. Keeping the oil price stable *is* a good investment, however a better one would be to find alternative sources of oil/energy. Let the muslims fight each other to the last man - with sticks and stones.

10010 2018-01-28 16:50:25 Chili oil on all the surfaces they chew on... Works on pups too.
10011 2018-01-28 16:50:24 Coconut oil will also strip your hair shafts if you use it in your hair. It might make it seem soft at first, but that is literally because it stripped your hair shaft and allowed more moisture in, but will damage it later.
10012 2018-01-28 16:49:45 Arn't the charging stations and green subsidies financed through their oil sales though? At least its creating demand.
10013 2018-01-28 16:49:40 What does your “trini” oil down look like?

10015 2018-01-28 16:49:25 Just to let you know, the oil and gas industry receives tens of billions a year in taxpayer funded subsidies. But yeah, be mad at the people trying to stop corporations from destroying our society in the name of quarterly profits.
10016 2018-01-28 16:49:22 to slow them down and to cause fire when u have oil spills!!
10017 2018-01-28 16:49:10 Surely the Kurdish Militia contributed more to defeating Daesh than our Turkish friends who knowingly supported ISIL in the first 2 years smuggling oil & weapons/fighters. Hope this is not UK Gov political expediency?
