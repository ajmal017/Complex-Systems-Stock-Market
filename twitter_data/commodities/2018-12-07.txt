1 2018-12-09 23:42:52 Commodities entraram em TB. O fundo?? Nem Jesus sabe!
2 2018-12-09 23:32:56 They are commodities to you, not people. They’ll soon see who you are, and you’ll have to runaway.
3 2018-12-09 23:29:08 BINGO!! It's always about the $$...'99 Ds-Rs-WJC repealed Glass-Steagall Then WJC pardons Mark R(ei)ch on Jan 20, 2000 as a big FU to the American ppl! Mark Reich helped create a K-st Commodities Mkt enriching enemy Iran-NGO's>USAID>CF-WEF-CFR-EU-UN-Oligarchs & Progressive Elites
4 2018-12-09 23:18:32 A subtle distinction. They bought their seventh "house" as presumably they didn't move residence seven times. We have to stop seeing places where people live as commodities.
5 2018-12-09 23:14:52 Not weird. We have #RECartel so why not #FormulaCartel? Commodities.
6 2018-12-09 23:11:39 Drugs makes you addicted to commodities produced by capitalists and thus dependent on the continuance of capitalism.
7 2018-12-09 23:10:23 Jim, you have insight on paper trades and max supply of paper (manipulated price) gold? Or just dreaming of time when the @CFTC bans fractional reserve commodities?
8 2018-12-09 23:07:34 Legal, isso me lembra dos períodos de bonança do governo Lula, em que vários países emergentes progrediam com alta das commodities, entre eles o Brasil, entretanto ainda existe asno pneumático que acha que Lula fez um bom governo.
9 2018-12-09 23:02:55 Já ouviu falar em boom de commodities? Fatores externos sem qualquer interferência do governo? Lembra que a China comprava tudo? Mais uma cagada do PT que nada fez por isso? Agora vamos falar dos números que importam. Bens de capital, infra estrutura e produtividade. Quer ver?
10 2018-12-09 23:00:34 If all of the cloud providers make great tools to migrate in from other clouds, then it can be like musical chairs. Eventually compute, storage and network will be traded as commodities on financial exchanges.

12 2018-12-09 22:55:36 Ese seguro fue lo único sensato que hizo. Todas las petroleras, cerealeras en fin todo el que opera con commodities opera permanente en los mercados de futuro y spot hedgeando posiciones y necesidades, claro de forma profesional.
13 2018-12-09 22:50:32 Maybe there are cultural barriers that prevent Asians from spending enough to fix this imbalance. Regardless, there are essential commodities that all countries need yet, are primarily priced in dollars, which is what many want to move away from.
14 2018-12-09 22:35:16 Sunday nite calls, corn mixed, wheat down 1 cent, sobybeans mixed up 1 cent. Crop report Tuesday, ? Export demand up ? No yield update. Key if #China buys this week. #weather is SA is favorable . Choppy range trade continues #Trump #Xi
15 2018-12-09 22:16:42 Desindustrialização, certo! Endividamento da população, certo! Hipertrofia da máquina estatal, certo! Exportações exageradamente baseadas em commodities, certo!
Mas o que isso tem a ver com a suposta “comunização” do país, que vc diz ter ocorrido??!!
16 2018-12-09 22:00:44 Worries to be sure, yet that may not figure in Australia as a major exporter of commodities which broke the chart the last time around.

I would not mind to hear more about the Myth of Freedom
17 2018-12-09 21:43:07 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
18 2018-12-08 23:43:18 There is not a set finite supply of a lot of commodities.
19 2018-12-08 23:32:19 "Commodity production didn't exist in the USSR" 

They sold products overseas (from weaponry, to cameras) let alone commodities. 

That's commodity production. production for a profit rather than for a need basis. 

The Inca empire didn't have commodity production...
20 2018-12-08 23:31:14 The capitalist knows that all commodities, however scurvy they may look, or however badly they may smell, are in faith and in truth money, inwardly circumcised Jews, and what is more, a wonderful means whereby out of money to make more money.
21 2018-12-08 23:29:33 "The confusion caused by attributing a hidden meaning to these cabalistic signs is all the greater, because these money-names express both the values of commodities, and, at the same time, aliquot parts of the weight of the metal that is the standard of money"
22 2018-12-08 23:15:19 Esa lógica únicamente tiene sentido si se parte de un modelo exportador de materias primas y productos con poco valor agregado. El salario mínimo debe ser función del mercado interno, no de las commodities fuera.
23 2018-12-08 23:12:42 Why do we care about a spike? About EOY? It’s the basic supply and demand concept, driven by utility that’ll increase price to wtf knows where - potentially to current BTC price even if commodities, securities, property, derivatives (anything with value attached) comes on board!
24 2018-12-08 23:08:03 Not quite the #toxicmasculinity of #white #incel culture but in the ballpark. The idea that women are commodities not people & should be availble to anyone who expresses a need.   If that doesn’t happen it’s not their fault—social skills, etc.—it’s the woman’s. 
25 2018-12-08 23:06:36 I understand the play, and how it's worked for other commodities. The reason I think bitcoin is different is that it serves a use. You'll never be able to spend your cash settled futures contracts on things online without revealing your identity. Real use = real demand. 
26 2018-12-08 22:56:47 Bitcoin having the ability to send payments electronically without much friction makes it much different than other commodities that sit in vaults.
27 2018-12-08 22:46:29 I studied Bilderburg Group for many years, made up most powerful people in world. & hold meetings in secret. Their objective is one world government with private international corporations supplying commodities. EU is a start by amalgamating coutries into a regional Government.
28 2018-12-08 22:24:42 Legado do PT-16 mais proficuos anos em financiamento, boom de commodities, e o Brasil? Crescimento de 40% contra 80% da AmericaLatina e 280% da Koreia. Votos do PT, 70% nos currais eleitorais que foram intencionalmente mantidos pobres (até 1SM) e ignorantes (Primário incompleto)
29 2018-12-08 22:16:39 No, just because it's happened more than once doesn't mean it's not bubble. Sure bitcoin has been gaining adoption throughout but it's had some bubbles along the way. Bubbles are natural consequence of financial markets, happens to stocks, commodities and crypto alike
30 2018-12-08 21:56:54 I'm not interested in anyone's money. Especially dating. It's little gestures and manners that turn me on/off.
Most can't afford the important commodities.
Time 
Understanding
Integrity/transparency.
31 2018-12-08 21:46:10 Two of the most perishable commodities; airline seats and restaurant bookings. The airlines have it sorted!!
32 2018-12-08 21:27:34 Adhu India wants to murugasha...Moreover...After sanction threats of US was got through by Modi diplomacy..Process was on in full force for using rupee through exchange of crude with Indian medicine other commodities...
33 2018-12-08 21:21:40 Yes, we are price takers. Most ag commodities are traded on international exchange markets.

35 2018-12-08 21:08:25 Climate Change has very little or nothing to do with actual Weather conditions. Remember, the "Weather" Underground gang. Most are Population Control advocates & were in the Obama Administration.

Climate thinking of Commodities & sustaining deadly disease. ya

36 2018-12-07 23:51:28 I really never heard of Wolff. I see your definitions, which are different than mine.  So when you say socialism and communism means no more commodities, it sounds clearly wrong. All systems want and need to produce shoes, food and all commodities, even if not called commodities.
37 2018-12-07 23:36:52 Thus the worker will always be a slave of men who possess the taxes, the land, &amp; the commodities needed for the gratification of his needs.
38 2018-12-07 23:36:30 Good day on commodities for some today ;) Sadly not me 
39 2018-12-07 23:30:37 But, maybe hold on to your commodities and sell some equities? Although, higher potential returns on BTC
40 2018-12-07 23:05:45 I would say most trading e.g stock indices, commodities and cryptos.
41 2018-12-07 22:55:00 O PT fez isso ou a economia estava bem efemeramente com o superciclo das commodities e a crise nos EUA/Europa?
42 2018-12-07 22:54:58 This is psychopathic, sociopathic face of Neoliberalism...people as commodities to get what she thinks is right. No reforming that #Unfittoserve. #GTTO #GeneralElectionNow
43 2018-12-07 22:23:37 Vivir con deuda con Macri o con CFK.  Lo que mo vamos a poder elegir es vivir sin deuda. 
Quien da un plan de producción y de exportación más allá de commodities?  
Nadie? Entonces no hay futuro.
44 2018-12-07 22:19:24 I dont agree with Wolff on socialism
Why do u think socialism is communism? Why do u think Marx said no wages & no commodities?
Marx(Capital): Labor theory of value of a commodity can be objectively measured by the average number of labor hours required to produce that commodity.

47 2018-12-07 22:08:24 We live in a religious environment where people are simply making a living off being religious. They have turned the sacraments into commodities and preach about a Jesus that brings them a life of prosperity and happiness. That's not Jesus.
48 2018-12-07 22:08:00 No, socialism still has wages and still produces commodities
49 2018-12-07 22:04:47 Dow dropped another 500 points. 2018 might become a year that almost everything (stocks bonds commodities, hedge funds) is down. Will cash and lowvol be the one eyed king in the land of the blind? 
50 2018-12-07 21:54:37 Congressman, you have facts and truth on your side:  two commodities absent on the left.
51 2018-12-07 21:37:35 It’s possible to enjoy some of the endless commodities people came up with and still acknowledge that the system as a whole is really fucking shit for most people and should be scrapped. This really isn’t the intelligent ‘gottem’ tweet you thought it was. No ethical consumption..
52 2018-12-07 21:32:43 The media haven't told the entire story here either. New rail car won't do squat if there isn't the rail space to move them. So to move these new car (which really only scratch the surface) What gets displaced? Potash, grain, coal, commodities? IMO, too little too late.
53 2018-12-07 21:31:42 How is trader money a benefit to an average Nigerian? Look at the cost of other commodities and the rate of dollar, what can #10 thousand buy in this economical situation Buhari and APC has sunk us in. All I see is Poverty and Vote buying with their useless 10k.
