43 2018-12-12 23:39:05 @SullyCNBC Brian, just catching your discussion of why Brexit seems to matter for the Dow.  I would submit that it’s pushing the dollar ever higher, and we are dangerously close to a huge breakout.  Dow stocks are all global as you probably know, many have over half biz overseas.

46 2018-12-12 23:37:07 Imagine the tech sector fell and everyone focused on apple stock price, or Fang stocks instead of the whole market for a comparison. Oh wait that literally happened across all media last week and no apple fans said it was unfair, because that's normal if you are a leading asset.

49 2018-12-12 23:35:10 Study of gaps- all gaps must fill in- good earnings will fill up the up gap and bad earnings will fill in the low gaps. Momentum stocks drops 30-44% during 3 months window; time to buy is the quarterly tax time which is coming up next week- market reset all the charts to correct
50 2018-12-12 23:33:15 I say on the podcast, you have to know what you're buying. The energy industry is BIG. The stocks don't all react the same to crude sell offs. Services, big integrated, refiners will all be different than that small driller with just 5 rigs in the Permian.

52 2018-12-12 23:32:00 Also, the stocks aren't down much among the big integrateds. That's why most investors own them. They are less volatile but you also don't get the upside. Even EOG is down just 3% year-to-date. The insiders have no reason to jump in. But some smaller E&Ps are down 40%. They do.
53 2018-12-12 23:31:56 I’m totally with you, Tom. Sorry - my comment was more a glib remark to those who claim some sort of say so on what’s what. “Self-identify” is the right approach and people would be mad to try and claim to be, if they genuinely are not.
54 2018-12-12 23:28:49 Key point is that $nbev is not moving with the other #pot #CBD type stocks.

Others are not ready
55 2018-12-12 23:28:41 Then why have the stocks fallen by 1400+ points in the last week? That;s not a sign of a good economy

65 2018-12-12 23:20:55 It’s only because when crypto was going nuts $GRAT wanted to drop some stupid buzz words like “blockchain” “crypto” etc... now that those stocks are in the dump $GRAT just looks stupid.

The moves sparked talk that the much-anticipated “Santa Claus Rally” may have finally arrived after a rough December start for equities. What’s concerning about the jump in stocks is that it was all based on vague comment…

83 2018-12-12 23:07:25 If those two were stocks there’d be a buy recommendation on them. Greenwood, Aish and Mayne would be the players under pressure. Sier, despite his breakout 2nd half of the year, has me super excited for 2019.

98 2018-12-12 22:55:33 I'm not against knives or guns. I'm for much stricter background checks for guns and the immediate ban of bump stocks & assault rifles.

100 2018-12-12 22:51:43 But legislators get to buy and sell stocks affected by their legislation and lack thereof to their heart's content. It's how Maxine and Nancy-to name two-made millions after winning congressional seats.

128 2018-12-12 22:39:09 Barrell of crude oil goes down but gas and diesel goes up. This is how you make money if you are rich,have a stocks. But what the heck it is UCL, lets waste time on already rigged sport matches.
129 2018-12-12 22:39:03 I have hope 2019 is gonna be my year. Saving money up to start buying stocks and gonna get into real estate/talent buying.
130 2018-12-12 22:38:40 Sweet :)  That explains why $NBEV is flying after hours, all the U.S. hemp stocks are up, and Canadian pot stocks are down from people leaving pot stocks for hemp stocks.
131 2018-12-12 22:38:31 I need to dedicate more of my time to trading cryptos and stocks. #btc #Bittrex #Binance #Stocks
132 2018-12-12 22:37:54 By continually telling lies and using the crooked press controlled by their rich cronies, they've managed to divert the attention away from Tory austerity and blame the EU and immigrants. Short British stocks, avoid EU tax, sell the NHS to America and import shitty food?
133 2018-12-12 22:37:44 How do you think the Oil/Fuel hedging strategies panned out for the Trannies these past 2 months? 

Not too good is my guess... It will come out in the wash (earnings). Why these stocks are dead money until after this upcoming earnings cycle.

New York (AFP) - The British pound rose Wednesday as British Prime Minister Theresa May survived a no-confidence vote in parliament while global stocks rallied on improved hopes for the US-China trade talks.
141 2018-12-12 22:33:19 Should have stocks in Skippers as much as I eat there

144 2018-12-12 22:32:18 Nope, for some reason elected officials can own stocks, even ones they affect
145 2018-12-12 22:32:03 Because everyone is selling into each rally these days until the stocks are low enough to make money on the next leg up.  As soon as retail investors stop jumping in too soon, the market will flush out and rallies then will hold a bit longer.
146 2018-12-12 22:31:28 So corrupt. Our reps should NOT be allowed to buy individual stocks. Index and mutual funds O.K., but only if held in a blind trust of some kind.
147 2018-12-12 22:31:05  You are a one woman gas industry. You spew so much Democrat gas the fishery industry should sue you for causing global warming and killing off their fish stocks.
148 2018-12-12 22:29:36 Opposite actually.
149 2018-12-12 22:29:24 The money you have in paper stocks, ETFs and mutual funds is making Wall Street rich and doing next to nothing for you.

Real Estate is a great investment, and over time, nothing can stop it.
150 2018-12-12 22:28:20 They didn't predict their stocks plummeting. Go ahead, search for Tumblr stock. Right now. Screen grab it, and show it. You can't know why? Their stocks went down so badly they were removed from tracking sites. Don't call these people geniuses, they made a lazy decision.
151 2018-12-12 22:27:37 Bowser's fastest frame option has always been upB, it was F6 in Smash 4 making it you go-to panic option (right in front of F7 jab)

153 2018-12-12 22:26:31 I mean the one side of me hopes it’s true to get in on the pullback. Other side of me just wants the pot stocks community to make money. So it’s a win win
154 2018-12-12 22:25:49 Have a look at the podcast “Value Stocks”. It’s quite close to what you are describing.
155 2018-12-12 22:25:39 I will say that #Google and #Twitter are two stocks that I'm kind of kicking myself for not owning.
156 2018-12-12 22:24:48 honestly it could just be the stigma against slower play.

Some chars seem slow or can be a lot of games i've been running 7 minutes and those still go close to time, I've already had timeouts already vs inklings, belmonts and others because of camping or multiple 160%+ stocks

171 2018-12-12 22:13:13 Vanadium stocks have been among my biggest gainers this year. I sold them all except one and I'm trying to buy another at my set price. So far so good. If all plays were like this I'd be smiling.
172 2018-12-12 22:13:05 No, but this is like vaccination and herd immunity.

Vaccinating my kids for measles doesn’t itself eradicate measles. But it helps prevent the spread of measles.

Or to use the immigration metaphor, it reduces lunatic flows without affecting stocks.
173 2018-12-12 22:12:42 That was just one of several of what used to be good dividend stocks, most of the sector is obliterated now - even the strongest like ENB are much weaker companies than before
174 2018-12-12 22:12:37 The pond might drop against the Euro and Stocks in Feather suppliers may go down if we have no deal.
175 2018-12-12 22:11:56 They’re actually taking advice from a group of shorter’s who watch these stocks go up and they strategically start bashing the stock scaring people at the same time shorting the stock. I’ve been doing this for years and know who they are.
176 2018-12-12 22:11:23 So dang many people looking to reduce their longs on rallies so until we go over 2815 for a weekly close it’s hard to get fully committed to stocks

-sell all on signing day and buying back in later?
- hold some long, sell some that day?
- hold w expectation that it’ll rise over the next week or so?

Thank you 
181 2018-12-12 22:06:57 Jack is so much richer than Myanmar military and the military is so poor that they cannot provide enough stocks and facilities to their staffs. I don't see the point that you make commitment.
182 2018-12-12 22:06:29 Well at least he knows he and Foreman are the laughing stocks of the league. Send Paxson to AA and Gar overseas somewhere, maybe Afghanistan.
183 2018-12-12 22:06:10 While factually correct, you didn't seem to grasp the point.
Guns kill much faster than other devices.
CSGLs would limit the tools used to kill people.
Like bump stocks.
The guns would still be legal.
But there must be a discussion of their effectiveness.

206 2018-12-12 21:52:15 I would argue that the stock market is a divining pool with a mixed record of prediction. A prolonged period of stock sell-offs can be a precursor for recession but sell-offs happen and stop & rebound all the time because stocks are affected by human psychology
207 2018-12-12 21:52:12 The top five stocks that closed lower today were $UAA. $UA, $MOS, $MAC, and $PSA.

210 2018-12-12 21:50:43 What is comes down to is, will the National Guard/other forces follow the Congress and Courts, or Donald & his MAGAmilitia, when they take to the streets with their bump-stocks?

It seems clear they want to see blood spilt.
211 2018-12-12 21:50:41 You're always good for a laugh. An idiotic trade war w/China. Retaliatory tariffs. Market gains wiped out by plunging stocks. Runaway spending & tax cuts that fail to produce the revenues the govt. needs to pay for the things that Trumpkins demand. THAT's the Trump legacy.
212 2018-12-12 21:50:36 Hi Donnie, would you mind sorting out the trade war a.s.a.p. It's just that I'm pretty sure you're going to be removed from office soon and/or jailed and I'd really like to see the stocks heading up before that happens.

Muchas gracias.

254 2018-12-12 21:24:47 @Connormc78 Smash review:
Game 1has a decent young link.
Game etc. Uses too many smash attacks and dash attacks. Too afraid to go off stage, so afraid that he can't even recover. Only managing to take stocks via aforementioned smash attach spamming.
Stay tuned for more.
255 2018-12-12 21:24:10 "Because the market is in a slump"... LOL???
Are the FAANG stocks gonna be outlawed as well? Because they're going to shit too.
256 2018-12-12 21:24:03 China es una dictadura y no quiere que sus ciudadanos se muevan libremente. Por eso triunfan los electricos. Eso y que el medio ambiente les importa un rábano, no es significativo.
Los stocks los vamos a absorber los pringados que tendremos pisapapeles de 1500 kg. no las marcas
257 2018-12-12 21:23:55 People have some trashy rules for stocks in Smash Ultimate
258 2018-12-12 21:23:09 Hatte eben noch ne wichtige Nachricht zu beantworten sorry deshalb erste zwei Stocks nicht verteidigen können 
259 2018-12-12 21:23:00 It’s ok there are a ton more broken characters now. Well they’re only broken in the context of smash 4. Let people faster we’ll just use more stocks. Matches will be more explosive haha.
260 2018-12-12 21:22:57 It feels perfect bc if i lose a stock or two stocks comebacks are possible, whereas two stocks just feels bad, and qith four stocks if you lose 3 before they lose their first you generally might as well SD
261 2018-12-12 21:21:18 Absolutely love how people saying not to hike rates are the same ones that always tout that the stock market is not the economy. Stop pumping the markets, you nonce. Stocks are allowed to go down.

263 2018-12-12 21:20:24 Oh bugger off. Such is the utter shambles your party is causing, I’d take every single Tory politician and put them in stocks with endless amount of rotten food to throw at them.

269 2018-12-12 21:18:54 Still more down trends in stocks. $SPY
Caution advised even though we saw a few strong rallies in the last couple of days, a nice example is $TWTR.
270 2018-12-12 21:18:16 Remember that time when Obama got caught paying a porn star to keep quiet about the affair and he faced impeachment and he had rallies to incite racism and he imposed tariffs that shutdown auto plants and the stocks plummeted...  WHICH HAUNT
271 2018-12-12 21:18:07 He's wrong that corporations won't get bailed out.  Fed will buy corporate bonds, stocks, ETFs, this time around.  Normies will say they must do it to save the economy.  Main street will get 55 gallon drums of lube.
272 2018-12-12 21:17:27 Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, Apple, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Exxon, Chevron, Square, NVDA, JD - Tons of good stocks to buy. I would not buy cloud stocks, healthcare etc as they are at all time highs.

275 2018-12-12 21:15:57 me: how can I convert these stocks into beanie babies so I can protect my investment?

@RobinhoodApp support agent: sir my manager said I have to stop responding to you
276 2018-12-12 21:15:55 Because you are not going to get that back in cash. It will be a mix of stocks and cash. And $DVMTV at 120 will be overvalued at the begining when everyone would want to go out of it. Should be fine mid-long term
277 2018-12-12 21:15:20 To be fair g88 they ipo’d at 20c and it got as high as $1.2.
95% + of stocks in the small end don’t make it and reinvent them selves. Anyone who has been around knows this, always been like that in small end... you roll the dice
278 2018-12-12 21:15:20 Gold and miners have one of the best set-ups I have seen in years. It’s like all roads point to people finally having to own some - inflation, defecits/debt, falling stocks, trade war, faltering/tapped-out Fed at odds w/ Trump. 7+ year bear market looks like it might be over

280 2018-12-12 21:14:45 I would buy facebook, netflix, apple for sure. Not sure about fake cloud stocks.

283 2018-12-12 21:14:02 I would join in with the popcorn trend but my local shop only stocks toffee and sweet in insultingly small bags (two for a quid, mind) or a massive bag of salted that would absolutely kill my lips.
284 2018-12-12 21:13:44 Here's a pleasant thought (not). 

Year-end tax selling could be heavier than usual because so many stocks are red YTD.

289 2018-12-12 21:12:19 When growth crashes the Fed lowers interest rates = stimulus = helps stock market. Everyone agrees. Yet Fed hiking rates next week (opposite of stimulus), so many are claiming year end rally anyways....that = tightening = headwind to stocks. Why is this not a given? Strange.

317 2018-12-12 21:01:05 So not right on the rally ending with S&P up 2% as this skidding market manages over a 1% gain. Still a pretty solid day for longs. I will claim partial victory in that those who bought the open were not punished like recent past. #stocks

326 2018-12-12 20:59:00 I don't like time outs because percentage isn't what matters in smash, stocks are. So deciding the winner based on percentage seems counterintuitive. It nerfs characters who kill early and buffs characters who kill later.

337 2018-12-12 20:52:03 Well we will have to see if that is true when it comes to the market seeing as how marijuana stocks just started being listed but definitely traditionally people tend to drink more during hard times causing alcohol stocks to rise.
338 2018-12-12 20:52:02 Dood, if I'm buying stocks today I'm too afraid to tell anyone.

375 2018-12-12 20:40:01 Ok up to you.  Invest in EM stocks if you want to.  I would suggest that you be very selective when doing so.  Most Russian, Chinese, Latin American stocks on a market cap weighted basis aren't great.  Just be sure what you are actually buying.  EM is a marketing label IMO.

386 2018-12-12 20:32:49 The CAP has always had it problems at every change demonstrations in the early 70s- then in the 80s French farmers dumping Spanish strawberries, huge stocks of food in the mid 80s Italian farmers trying to get a cow into the EU commission etc, so def not perfect,can we do better?
387 2018-12-12 20:32:45 I either buy the VIX cheap, or I buy stocks after they crash
388 2018-12-12 20:32:39 @LamboJohnny I really like how you demonstrated how you evaluate stocks.  Got a question for you, what are your top 5 value picks
389 2018-12-12 20:32:36 you get to capture the same benefit from stocks movement at a much lower premium, the cost of one contract is much less than that of 100 shares, but you get the same benefit from each con
390 2018-12-12 20:31:56 It was simple game: cocking coal under 100USD/t loco Newcastle, Australia (bottom was 75 $/t)? ->JSW is unprofitable, so throw away it's stocks. 
Cocking coal over 100 USD/t? JSW is profitable. More expensive cocking coal -> funds want to pay more for JSW stocks
391 2018-12-12 20:30:46 Wall Street Instant Update;  3:30pm #Stocks off highs with the Dow Industrials up 230 at 24,600 into the final half hour, the Nasdaq Comp. up 90, the S&P 500 up 25

392 2018-12-12 20:29:34 I continue to see many many stocks hanging around day in and day out. Until these roll over, opportunity is probably presenting itself.

I don’t know what this holds for the future overall market direction, but overall consensus is “the end is near.” Lets see.. Price > Crowd $SPY
393 2018-12-12 20:29:15 It's confusing as heck b/c it's very complex. No one knows what to expect. But, if the current PM gets ousted, that means the risk of Brexit No Deal is higher than a Brexit Deal. No deal means more chaos for the UK & their stock, which would most likely spill over to world stocks

1) In a mkt discounting a '19 economic slowdown, some recession-resistant growth titles become more attractive, albeit w/ premium multiples of earnings
2) Growth issues are sensitive to higher rates. In last month, the yield on 10s has dropped from 3.24% to 2.90%. #stocks

398 2018-12-12 20:27:24 Yeah, I’m wondering if the boyds are good stocks. The one that comes with the gun is said to be fine, barrel is free floated, but I want a stock that wont flex as much.

406 2018-12-12 20:21:47 I would beg to differ , do you understand the complexity of the supply chain? Fair enough "stocking up" - but stocks cost money, and the lost efficiencies would dwarf the "£39 billion".

413 2018-12-12 20:17:29 Stocks are important. They can greatly affect the accuracy of a rifle. Especially at long distance. But if the rifle itself is cheap, referring to quality, a stock can only do so much. 

If it's worth it, get it trued and to a stock you like.

442 2018-12-12 20:01:59 The theory as I understand it is that shorter clock encourages time outs. Not that they shouldn’t ever happen because they will happen, just that it shouldn’t be incentivized. The competitive game is meant to mainly about taking all of your opponents stocks.

446 2018-12-12 19:58:29 Investing Hypothesis:  If we take the current state of #GE and #F as true indicators of the health of American industry, then we arrive at the conclusion that trillions of 401k money was parked in FAANG mostly because "momentum" stocks cannot be accurately valued.
447 2018-12-12 19:58:28 That true. But insider trading is popular and owners & executives are the first to sell off. It's happening across the board with all the other stocks too. The mkt sux bigtime now.

529 2018-12-12 19:17:47 You should outlaw stocks because many have lost savings due to the significant slump in the stock markets...
530 2018-12-12 19:17:05 Stocks look fairly close to the next selloff on this leg down, but it may take until January. Fed may not deliver on 19th, if the market rallies a bit more next week. It may mark the point of no return for equities. Then, Fed will probably reverse the course for the retracement.

535 2018-12-12 19:13:58 In the past I would be buying stocks today. Why ? Feels like start of potential 2-5 day move up. In attempt to catch that move I am forced to buy day 1, waiting on day 2-3 of the rally would not leave much for gains.
536 2018-12-12 19:13:44 The people who keep coming back to crash the market are due to get stuffed. Really annoying. I just want to focus on buying good stocks and selling bad ones, I've had it with the lower lower lower crap.

540 2018-12-12 19:12:39 I think there are interesting stocks for the value investor out there.  

I also think they aren't the same ones that led in 2017 / 2018

I also think it's highly likely we trade 2500 or below 

So execution depends ones patience and pain tolerance.

550 2018-12-12 19:09:42 The stock market is indicative of expected corporate profits not how the broader economy is doing. For example mass layoffs can drive stocks up as it is a shedding of corporate expenses. Those layoffs clearly hurt overall economic growth.
551 2018-12-12 19:09:17 Dow at 15450 Jan16, election day stocks above 18000, ended 2016 at short of 20000. For context both Dow and S&P 2018 are lower than they were in January. Did you know that Personal Income changes are lower and slower than post recession Obama economy? That's what matters to most.

581 2018-12-12 18:52:18 Exactly, no volume and few buyers or sellers yet stocks just keep moving higher. Algo’s are breaking up orders using the odd lot order system to bid prices up. Humans used to go to jail for that.

587 2018-12-12 18:48:14 it can be an added instrument, beside stocks. I wouldn't bet too much on it obviously. But you can either exercise the option after the duration or simply profit from the value increase.

591 2018-12-12 18:45:07 If the market has a few more good up days like this one, it’ll be safe to buy stocks again.

621 2018-12-12 18:34:14 There should at least be a warning stating, I work in the RE industry, I make more money in a RE bull market therefore I may be biased. 

Similar to most analysts being positive on the stocks they cover...there is a bias.
622 2018-12-12 18:33:31 I am starting a mentoring program for traders here soon but if you’re not interested I recommend reading up on the Greeks for options.

650 2018-12-12 18:24:15 At midday, Mortgage Bonds flat. Stocks rallying ... Dow +450 points. 10-yr yield 2.91%.
651 2018-12-12 18:24:05 Especially if you're a #Hodler and not interested in trading, you don't want an exchange (not sure if any do this) leveraging out your coins so someone can borrow to short and on margin to boot, going directly against your position. This is quite common in stocks.
652 2018-12-12 18:23:20 Ford the drug dealer who stole his brother's inheritance, and the majority of whose caucus is accused of crimes was the only "sane" choice? Trump the life long criminal and scam artist who knows nothing about anything was the only option? The US and Ontario are laughing stocks.
653 2018-12-12 18:22:20 This is the result of globalism: driving down wages while driving up stocks, creating great disparities in wealth+opportunity. Before anyone claims well your pension/401k is stock-driven too, check who owns the VAST majority of stocks. It sure isn't the dwindling middle class.

689 2018-12-12 18:03:38 They have pulled out of the market. Guess who hasn't? Most of middle class. Guess who's assuming majority of the risk now? Have you looked into your mutual funds to see what junk stocks they have you invested in? The fact they are openly admitting this scares the hell out of me.

707 2018-12-12 17:58:02 The economy isn't working. Stocks have plunged again, bonds are signaling a looming recession, wages have been stagnant, borrowing is out of control, the deficit is at a record high, and job creation is lagging.
708 2018-12-12 17:57:51 Macron got rid of the ISF and changed it to the IFI, Impôt sur la Fortune Immobilière, so only on real estate. That implies that stocks and other financial tools would not be taken into account as part of this new tax on wealth (they are still taxed, however, through a flat tax)

Which is odd, because the 300% gain in stocks from 2009 lows under obama had nothing to do with obama. Entirely coincidental

764 2018-12-12 17:27:30 Shutting down the federal government, which means closing non-essential services, would be *good* for the US economy and stocks.  The GOP should embrace it as a feature, not a bug.
765 2018-12-12 17:27:29 As long as my names aren't prone to collapse and flat-lining like a $CPG, I actually prefer volatility. Mean reversion strategies work better - more torque to the rotations in and out.  Why I include a few higher quality gold stocks in the mix, for example. Lots of meandering.

818 2018-12-12 17:00:25 I mean if your holding most of your net worth in currency you are wrong. Investments such as real estate, stocks bonds and businesses that produce income should be used to beat inflation and multiply your assets over time.

Fortunately only 8% have it all in stocks. My husband months ago switched us into a "safeharbor " account.

838 2018-12-12 16:52:27 Amazing to me that people don't consider A) why do stocks go up? B) in light of this where is it best to invest long-term?  Asset allocation isn't rocket science.  The US is number 1 for investors and it probably always will be.  Just look at the S&P 500 sector breakdown and ROE!

845 2018-12-12 16:49:04 The stock market index acts like a barometer which shows the overall conditions of the market. They facilitate the investors in identifying the general pattern of the market. Investors take the stock market as a reference to decide about which stocks to go for investing.

861 2018-12-12 16:40:45 Wall Street climbs 1 percent on trade optimism: U.S. stocks rose 1 percent on Wednesday, boosted by technology stocks, as a report about China planning to increase access for foreign firms added to optimism fueled by President Donald Trump's upbeat comments on trade.

869 2018-12-12 16:37:44 Understood that trying to time the market often fails. Still, would it make sense to make an IRA more conservative (less % in stocks) while the market is high, and make it more aggressive (more % in stocks) when low so that you're buying stocks  when prices are relatively low?
870 2018-12-12 16:37:23 Omg same. I had a coworker tell me to get an account at a credit union in my early 20's and I was like "what for" LOL I think the difference is you pay them to help you invest in good stocks so your money can grow?? #dontquoteme

889 2018-12-12 16:28:26 Yes, the analogy is far from perfect, but sometimes the perfect is the enemy of good enough. If you want to nudge the analogy a little closer, imagine a stock split into A and B stocks, with different voting power perhaps, which could then be traded independently. Same tax thing.
890 2018-12-12 16:28:12 You are sadly misinformed.

913 2018-12-12 16:17:40 The stupid thing is that QE would have worked much better if the ECB had bought stocks, and it maybe US treasuries even. Of course the latter is similar to a foreign exchange intervention and the Americans would not have been happy, but would also give more bang for the buck.

1177 2018-12-12 14:43:41 It's pretty amazing how little bio stocks are moving on fundamentals these days compared to how much they move on macro. Example: $ITCI up 1% on NDA acceptance yesterday, but up 3% today because major indexes are up. Momentum/technical traders are swamping the fundamentalists.
1178 2018-12-12 14:42:42 Yeah, I'll take half when they visit 16 again, but she first drew my eye having gone parabolic this summer on crypto-inflated sales. In a slowing-growth economy (currently), growth stocks are going to take a beating.

1229 2018-12-12 14:22:22 In my exp selling stocks over the  logic is rarely at any point as important as emotion. 1 way it comes into to play is to build the emotion so high then ask for something reasonable and it will appear to be logical compared to where you have them mentally if that makes sense.

With our stocks of energy and natural resources, we can be the Saudi Arabia of North America.
1270 2018-12-12 14:02:37 We're seeing a continued intervention to reverse US stocks, which involves headlines, exchange order flow pauses, Fed speak, etc. This move by overseers is the admittance that they screwed up on policy as the global economy is slowing.
1271 2018-12-12 14:01:57 Super late models are pro stocks.  Supers are super modifieds. Fight me.
1272 2018-12-12 14:01:53 For sure, as long as there is just a 1 way range shift of stocks, there WILL BE  losers & winners. Relative stability needs aligning with range shift to be compatible with full implementation of Landings Obligation.
1273 2018-12-12 14:00:52 We would expect no free run loans to Corny big commercial establishments... we have our money that banks play with may it be by savings , investments vide stocks and kind . Stringent policies got to be in place , instead of just a call from a politicians to lick their boots with.

1275 2018-12-12 14:00:32 I want to apologize for using your first name Mr. Bongino. I voted for President Trump my love most the stuff he’s doing but I think by him saying about the slide fire stocks or bump stocks just gave all these liberal legislators a greenlight?

1284 2018-12-12 13:56:17 CNBC's progression of commentary is hilarious and predictable. Sep 2018 - this bull run is just getting started. It's "middle aged"! Oct/Nov 2018 - get defensive on stocks but the economy is great. Yield curve inversion means nothing. Dec 2018 - Just kidding. crisis on the way

1294 2018-12-12 13:49:59 Close to unfollowing you. There are too many headwinds for stocks to make all time highs again. Charts look terrible. Hike next week. Buybacks slowing down / not effective. QT still in effect. What fundamentals are you looking at? Forward P/E? lol
1295 2018-12-12 13:49:58 Just about half of the Nasdaq 100 (51/100) and S&P500 (248/500 stocks) are more than 20% off their 52-week highs. The trend is still down.
1296 2018-12-12 13:49:46 This is illogical. Index had metal and utilities stocks in major proportion earlier which got replaced by high performing growth stocks (eg. Bajaj twins) taking the overall PE to high. High PE doesn't mean risk all the times. There is a reason Ferrari is costlier than Hyundai.
1297 2018-12-12 13:49:38 What a crock! Stocks generally (not just retailers) are on the decline because 1) we have an unstable moronic criminal in the oval office who 2) got us into an idiotic trade war raising costs that cut into profits. Stocks r a leading indicator. Trump is driving us to a recession.
1298 2018-12-12 13:49:25 (1/2) We have been neutral on Eurozone stocks. But there is no denying that the Eurozone has had a disappointing year. The Eurozone economy has been going through a soft-patch recently.

1312 2018-12-12 13:41:25 Yes and no. Of course their are many schemes where people pump up stocks for their profit. Similarly when they criticize a stock for their gain. We need moderation at both ends.

A company usually fights incredible odds just to survive. No need to increase their burden.
1313 2018-12-12 13:40:24 @HalftimeReport Another Steve Weiss pick getting killed this morning. Neurocrine Biosciences NBIX is down $16. This guy is so bad & is clueless about stocks. Please replace him on the show. Just listen to the tapes ... wrong, wrong, wrong.

1318 2018-12-12 13:38:41 My point being, it's a good start, but it won't fix the issue of congressmen trading stocks with insider info. What's to stop congress-A from giving insider info to help congress-B, and vice versa?
1319 2018-12-12 13:38:40 One more #BEEQB news:
6. We have a Cyprus broker with a license for brokerage and underwriting. This is still a partnership, we do not buy, but anything is possible. That is, after the new year, we can issue stocks, bonds, sell them to both qualified investors and unqualified.
1320 2018-12-12 13:37:39 Nice just remember to lock in profits too!
1321 2018-12-12 13:36:34 I think most of the FAANG stocks will exceed 20%. Not so sure about FB's ability to do that but the others likely will. A lot of money has been moved out of the market and will move back in if we see momentum shift to the upside.

b) raise tax break on real estate loans 
c) reduce interest rates

1341 2018-12-12 13:25:29 Seems, one step near end of trade war with China.
China eliminate 20% tariff USA imported cars ( keep standard 15% ), and buy again soybeans from U.S. Farmers. 
Remain bullish despite volatility selective Chinese stocks.

1391 2018-12-12 12:58:03 Yes, some things never do really do change. At the same time, most traders would do well to downgrade their own stocks (by selling them) before going down that far and waiting for the experts to downgrade them. Now perhaps the ultimate buy signal? Appreciate your update.

1521 2018-12-12 11:41:32 That along w/the bank stocks, and this is when I completely lost confidence in the stock market as being driven by company growth and fundamentals that could be measured thru open sources. Too many hands doing nefarious things and govt meddling.

1535 2018-12-12 11:33:08 The only logical explanation for dumping stocks like that in tremendous amounts is that his assets are frozen and needs money.
1536 2018-12-12 11:31:36 The company I work for has an employee freeze on buying or selling stocks before earnings announcements. Not sure what the exact rules are but this looks suspicious no less.

1539 2018-12-12 11:30:45 If owning stocks is a long-term project for you, following their changes constantly is a very, very bad idea. It’s the worst possible thing you can do, because people are so sensitive to short-term losses. If you count your money every day, you’ll be miserable -

1575 2018-12-12 11:00:37 Le 2 stocks sur smash4 à créé de la frustration. Les us le découvrent que mtn. Car il avait la mauvaise cible en tête. Oui 3 stocks c'est parfait. 4 c'est trop sans smash metter
1576 2018-12-12 10:58:05 Le 2 stocks smash 4 et le 2 stocks Ultimate n'ont rien à voir du tout mon bon !
Heureusement qu'ultimate se joue en 3 stocks haha

1580 2018-12-12 10:56:11 “The United Kingdom - my part in its downfall by Dave Cameron” please buy as stocks may not last and you’ll need something for fuel post Brexit....
1581 2018-12-12 10:55:29 I look forward to it 
1582 2018-12-12 10:55:00 My 2019 narrative looks as contrarian as my 2018 was a year ago: Markets have swung from a “synchronised goldilocks” to a “parallel shock” of a collapse is stocks, a new contagious EUR crisis and Chinese deflation. The confidence cost of underpriced volatility. Not fundamentals.
1583 2018-12-12 10:54:50 
1584 2018-12-12 10:53:57 obviously yes!! but sometime great investment stocks which are in uptrend can come very cheap...

1586 2018-12-12 10:53:04 A lot if them excepted large amounts of Russian cash, so they have to protect Trump or their next. The irony would be, that if they're sentenced to a private prison, then most of them would own a lot of stocks in it.
1587 2018-12-12 10:53:03 Humble advice. Go and teach yourself about stocks you will understand why you needn't say what you said.
1588 2018-12-12 10:51:57 WTF. Brexitbloke make £220M from trading on GBP fluctuations. I guess #Trump is skimming off from changes in chinese stocks as rucks the market. Something needs to change.

1591 2018-12-12 10:51:00 How would DCA help? Surely, unless you managed to time it and buy dips, you'd just be better off having your money in for longer (and getting dividends on it)? Also, I think a key pt here is not just what the return of stocks were, it's the opp cost. E.g., (1/2)
1592 2018-12-12 10:49:19 Bring back stocks!
1593 2018-12-12 10:48:36 Recommending to everyone $SRNE.

1594 2018-12-12 10:48:32 Though many small cap and mid cap stocks are looking gud and can give a better return then
TCS , bata and icicilombard ge still i buy these bcos probability of these going burst is less then the high returns giving small cap stocks . u need a mix.this game is all abt probability.
1595 2018-12-12 10:48:23 #trade Stocks cheered by Trump trade talk; sterling claws off lows

Stock markets rallied on Wednesday as U.S. President Donald Trump sounded upbeat about a trade deal with China, while sterling rose off 20 month lows as Prime Minister Theresa May vowed to fight a challenge …
1596 2018-12-12 10:47:57 some tips for share investors:
1. Buy stocks at the last week of the month as the stocks are available at minimum prices.
2. When Nifty is falling, Buy shares at 3 p.m.
3. Buy blue chip stocks when it is available at discounted prices due to any reason.

1598 2018-12-12 10:46:42 Perhaps 90 days to 100% profit in junior mining stocks? Many have lost 50% market cap since October due to Mr. Xi & Mr. Trump disagreement. They have affirmed resolution of trade dispute in 90 days.  Here are two to consider-- each with 2 large commercial ore deposits. HZM, ARS.
1599 2018-12-12 10:46:18 It all ends, all the fleet of cars at Burdillion, all the stocks at Ota Farms, all the monies stacked in septic tanks, all the holding on to power at all cost, it all ends one day

#ThinkDeeply
1600 2018-12-12 10:42:28 To me the bigger issue isn't how much has been wasted, but how much it has cost individuals and businesses in terms of lower exchange rates, stocks and shares, etc, due to all the uncertainty? Still it's not like the Conservative Party to care about its electorate, is it.

2017 2018-12-12 04:31:56 #stockmarkets are a crazy place. When it's down we want it to come up, when it starts going up we want it to fall a bit so that we can pick up those #stocks that we missed! :)
2018 2018-12-12 04:31:49 But that's not investing that is just speculating. What's truly hard is to have the patience to wait for the right price for filtered stocks and have the courage and conviction to ignore the noise and buy big when they do come within the MoS band..
2019 2018-12-12 04:31:43 I will transfer all my stocks , and liquid , and my XRP , way into the 7 figures if TD comes through, I can see TD MAKING HISTORY WITH THIS, AROUND THE WORLD THE NEWS WILL SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD ABOUT TD AS FAST AS THE SPEED OF LIGHT, TD HISTORY BEFORE BAKKT,& FID,NYC EXCHANGE

2022 2018-12-12 04:29:43 Stocks will fall if the BJP loses the assembly elections. But if BJP loses they will pump prime the economy which will lead to stocks going up.

Investing is Hard.
2023 2018-12-12 04:29:41 You might check you investment advisor, mine went up substantially. I believed what my President said and invested accordingly, in American businesses. Stayed out of foreign stocks completely.
2024 2018-12-12 04:27:34 I took 2 stocks off of @TSM_Leffen granted one of them was an SD... BUT STILL

If Avenatti then discovers Blackbeard's lost treasure, that's 11.3m, and if he puts it in penny stocks and wins big...

2034 2018-12-12 04:17:05 substitute to reliably take stocks. Bthrow kills at the ledge sooner now, sure, but they somehow nerfed jr's already abysmal grab range. Meaning he has to get even closer to his opponent to grab, in a game that rewards making hitboxes everywhere.

2036 2018-12-12 04:16:54 @jschultzf3 one might try and say that a stocks price range or expected value is mean reverted to within in range of the expected value.  But that depends on the size of the standard error associated with given expected value over given time.

2039 2018-12-12 04:16:35 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your fibromyalgia
2040 2018-12-12 04:16:22 stop your investments in stocks, the market is due to crash soon.
2041 2018-12-12 04:15:16 If you are even half decent at trading #cryptocurrency, chances are you could make some money playing stocks too.. Few months back I dipped into #rareearth #minerals and #uranium stocks, made a nice profit on #lithium mines too. Its not that different
2042 2018-12-12 04:14:54 For those completely new to penny stocks, check out tim sykes, steven dux, tim grittany, 3 guys with many followers, they have chatrooms too. They are good, guys in the chatrooms aren't. I learned a few things from them 3-4 years ago.

2046 2018-12-12 04:13:53 @jschultzf3 if stocks price reverted by to the mean stock value would never go up.
2047 2018-12-12 04:13:49 Yesterday saw a client portfolio- down approx 40 per cent in last few months- it was down 25 per cent 3 months back. He wants to move some money to Alternatives, but scared to book the losses. Many of the stocks are low quality. #dilemma
2048 2018-12-12 04:11:55 Is it me or does Smash Ultimate feel too balanced? Like I never have a super big lead. And when I’m behind, I even the stocks right away. I’m not saying it’s a bad thing, but just weird. Lmao or I’m just ass.
2049 2018-12-12 04:11:45 Unpopular opinion - lots of opportunity in markets today:

1) We are facing an unprecedented buying opportunity in EM
2) Small cap tech/recent IPO underperformance does not signal late cycle euphoria and presents opportunities
3) Bonds are still less attractive than stocks LT

2062 2018-12-12 04:01:01 I think it will soar leading up to the farm bill being passed tomm or after Trump pass. After its passed it'll slump, just like before.

2066 2018-12-12 03:56:53 Yes, I have a daughter who has celiac disease. Those are real issues. I'd ask anyway. I know the food bank here stocks gluten free foods & they try to provide them if specifically asked for bc of medical issues. You need to be able to eat, that's not snobbish. It's survival.
2067 2018-12-12 03:56:30 I give so many homie stocks. I want to earn my wins not have them given to me.
2068 2018-12-12 03:55:46 Do you guy's still have the stocks over there?
2069 2018-12-12 03:55:39 Sure!  And I'll throw in a few dozen high-performance stocks and bonds, while I'm at it.
2070 2018-12-12 03:54:42 It's not that I don't get the narrative. I just want to watch him being smashed. And I'm not sure Lewis can do that. Off course he lost stocks. He stood no chance against DC.
2071 2018-12-12 03:54:16 Agree with the 2nd part. Was just pointing that it's a bit contradictory to say that they don't do it willingly. If your conscience won't allow, you won't do it irrespective. Know Muslims who wont associate with alcohol in any form, won't buy alcohol stocks even if gains are huge
2072 2018-12-12 03:54:00 How about we forget about #TheWall and talk about the big dip in the #stocks last week??  @realDonaldTrump What are you doing to make this a more stable economy?  #TrumpShutdown #TrumpLiesMatter

2075 2018-12-12 03:49:14 one thing that caught my eye, i havent been watching much CNBC/Mad Money/financial shows at all lately, was Dow was just over 24,000 earlier today, and talk of another recent yesterday? "meltdown", but many stocks seem okay valuation quick glance.

2077 2018-12-12 03:47:29 Where? GM closing plants, BMW moving production lines to China from SC . More goods being imported and trade deficits are up in 2018. Our treasury has seen increased lost of revenue and our national debt continues to soar. And now stocks are dipping.
2078 2018-12-12 03:47:08 @POTUS Now if we could just protect America from angry white men with assault rifles and bump stocks. Wouldn’t that be something!
2079 2018-12-12 03:46:17 Its interesting #investors on the #ASX are chasing Aust REIT's for safety & yield among the carnage in #stocks. However tightening in #credit is hitting the #economy & the businesses profitability these leases are underpinned within these reits.
2080 2018-12-12 03:46:11 Does anyone here use stocks?

2083 2018-12-12 03:44:37 Snoop thru his phone just to see how the stocks are doing 
2084 2018-12-12 03:44:17 Is 58 dead horrible? Yes, yes it is. But banning bump stocks isnt going to change anything except make it so bad guys who dont follow the laws anyways will have it, some law abiding citizens will rightfully retain theirs "illegally", and others will give up what they shouldnt

2106 2018-12-12 03:26:22 What is the right strategy on Nifty ? 

Sell Nifty at 10610-650 is a good idea for 10450 after initial start 

Buy Nifty at start 10550 about is a good idea for 10610-650. 

All just my views.

2126 2018-12-12 03:09:43 I think Attack on Titan's thing was more that it was already popular whilst airing and so Netflix licensed it after it finished.

Disney's thing is going to be interesting and I do wonder if they're going to steal their market share (that seems to be what the stocks think).

U.S. stocks ended little changed after a volatile session as investors weighed the prospects for a trade deal and an agreement to fund the American government.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries held at 2.88 percent.

‘Twas the night before Christmas

The stocks were inflated by the GOP with care,

2134 2018-12-12 03:06:20 I'm more than aware of FRN's history. 

I'm also aware of what is an illegal security offering ($EOS).

You should look into rehypothecation and how *all* US securities (stocks, bonds, derivatives) are inflated just like dollars.

$BTC: Replace Money.
$RVN: Replace WallSt.
2135 2018-12-12 03:06:12 Agreed that $GKOS is one of the best acting stocks.  The past few months have been pretty tight.  Going to be long and see how if it runs
2136 2018-12-12 03:06:09 I would take 5 thousand and invest in dividend growth stocks. The other 10 thousand I would split up into 10 love accounts with acorns or stash or robinhood/wisebanyan.. And as soon as each account made itself in $$$ start the while trip over and keep it moving forward. Bless
2137 2018-12-12 03:06:03 STOCKS TO WATCH:

1. PADINI
2. AEON
3. PARKSON
4. BONIA

Most of them were negatively affected during tax holiday period as consumers zooming in on big-ticket items. Stocks are fairly valued. Consumer-friendly policies & stable consumer demand could boost retail sales.

2147 2018-12-12 03:00:45 Have I mentioned yet how much I love 3 stocks ?? Even if it statistically made little to no difference in results. It's just that feeling you get when you lose your first stock but then realize you still have 2 full stocks left makes the game so much less frustrating

2165 2018-12-12 02:48:01 I never said Govt NEEDED to issue debt. But they do. That is reality. Now lets look at the consequences. No bonds means pushing $21 trillion out of bonds and into other asset classes real estate Stocks Commodities etc. Issuing debt recycles profit/savings. The problem is deficits
2166 2018-12-12 02:47:12 What you said is very well put. Applies to stocks not crypto, a massively volatile/speculative asset class that has had three 80-99% crashes in 7 years. Average Joe should actually have stayed out of crypto. Yes many made fortunes. Many more list their shirts.
2167 2018-12-12 02:45:29 Congress voted some time ago 2 allow themselves the right to INSIDER TRADING ON THE STOCK MARKET.They know when they will/will not pass a bill affecting stocks it's how they acquire fortunes& reason they stick together.@realDonaldTrump do an EO to stop all govt insider trading.

Trump's border wall is finished. But we can't rock the headlines with this, we need to keep it internal. Stocks are volatile

2253 2018-12-12 01:40:02 Daisy now comes back into the 22. Seemed to score ok in 2018, not high on anyone's list but should be good for 80ppg over a minimum of 18 games for season. Worth a crack.

2256 2018-12-12 01:37:30 I keep checking Blizzard's stocks to see where they stand. They haven't been the same since BlizzCon this year. They keep fluctuating under $50/per stock. To put that in perspective, they were at $75 pre-Blizzcon 2018.

Meaning they took a hit and are barely recovering
2257 2018-12-12 01:36:14 Waiting for value stocks to outpace growth stocks has been akin to waiting for Godot—the moment never seemed to arrive. Until now. But this might not be the value rally investors have been waiting for.

2260 2018-12-12 01:32:40 You can say the same about big tech company stocks (Apple, Amazon, Google, etc.). These companies are effectively networks. There was a lot of hype and everyone was talking about it. A lot of people made tons of money, but the majority most likely got burned and panic dumped.

2280 2018-12-12 01:17:01 if the lows in U.S. Stocks are in, I think you'll see breakouts to new highs in $MSFT who has been showing some of the most relative strength of anybody as big as they are. That would likely be the next leader if we go higher. Good tell for either direction imo $XLK $DJIA

2339 2018-12-12 00:35:12 Truthfully, I doubt it. Stocks would get wiped out. That means pension funds, insurance funds, a flight of capital to safer less volatile places and currencies.
2340 2018-12-12 00:34:59 You can make the same argument for any poor in any rich country in the world. Structurally, however, Brazil is among the 10 largest economies, and people invest in real estate, stocks and fixed income.

In times past, capitalists did no work, not even managerial. Their income came from their capital. It may have been from tenant farmers, mines, stocks & bonds, factories, stores, etc. They hired managers to do the managerial work.

2349 2018-12-12 00:27:19 That's an interesting chart but 2010 and 2011 were a couple of years removed from the great financial crisis. Plus a lot of stocks, not just bank stocks, are off over 20% from their recent highs.
