42 2018-12-31 20:50:04 Ridiculous assertion. If you are so sure, please bet a few lakhs on futures of these commodities, you can become a crorepathi.
43 2018-12-31 20:38:29 It’s always been supply and demand with commodities. Artificially pricing them to provide a shortage or a glut is imperfect and has too much sway on investors. Let the natural ebb and flow of production needs dictate pricing.
44 2018-12-31 20:35:38 @cherylcasone I’m getting tired of hearing mySELF say it, but I remember prosperity with an exceptionally strong dollar, low commodities and delighted to get a 15.5% 30 yr fixed. I’m supposed to believe a 1k point decline over 25 more basis points?!
45 2018-12-31 20:27:43 They're both commodities.

48 2018-12-31 20:11:15 2/x Has not dropped in line with gasoline. That's because overall demand for diesel is higher & diesel is a gasoline byproduct. Diesel is also the primary fuel used in the Transport industry. The added costs to diesel by carbon pricing increase the overall costs of commodities..
49 2018-12-31 19:58:39 go long commodities, hurricane season coming will be worse than harvey; big big inflationary pressures developing.
50 2018-12-31 19:58:07 Organic specialty crop farmers suffer from no guarantees every year and no subsidies. Commodities markets are kind of ugly and not organic. Get creative don’t just sit back !

53 2018-12-31 19:53:12 tech workers aren't fungible commodities and increasing the supply by 5x with tech workers does not work the same way it would if you, e.g. increase the supply of feed corn by 5x
54 2018-12-31 19:52:37 Not true!Any economy can thrive so long as it has commodities or expertise to sell. Gold,Oil & many other things make USA wealthy.I agree war DOES make LOTS of $$$,but its not a necessity for prosperity; Defense is a necessity for survival. Peace! :D
55 2018-12-31 19:48:45 Possible.  That said, if u marry your understdg of BTC w/a knowledge of cash settled commodity & gold derivs how those derivs have been used to support the current USD centric system, you end up at same place: Any new neutral asset will likely drive gold & commodities up signif.
56 2018-12-31 19:36:17 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
57 2018-12-31 19:34:19 I got burned by cotton years ago before the 24-D genetics but ever since then...it’s been a cash cow. Really gets you going when you net $3-400/ac on dryland when all other commodities don’t have a shot to net anything remotely close.

61 2018-12-31 19:22:38 I’m sure you have your reasons, but I find it hard to understand why you do so much analysis of crypto when you get the most ignorant commentary on it. I’d really like to see more of your work on commodities, industrials, transports, etc.
62 2018-12-31 18:55:39 China is busy engaging in strategies that will allow them to self-sustain, but most westerners are dismissing those strategies (although fewer than a year ago.)  China's non-commodity goods trade surplus = $700B.  If China can price commodities in CNY, China is self-sustainable.
63 2018-12-31 18:51:11 Index funds are just one part of the best investment model-- you should also have REITs, t-bills, commodities, and some choice real estate. And some crypto just in case.

75 2018-12-31 18:06:41 Brexit has nothing to do with it. Its a supply & demand thing. Prices are kept artificially high because of the shortage, same as most commodities. Build more properties this will move the market towards a surplus, this lowers demand & so prices will fall, simple economics really
76 2018-12-31 18:02:25 Backing currency with gold or any commodity wld be throwing us back into the gold standard era. Its absolutely constraining. Note also that all commodities are finite- so what wld happen if we run out of such a commodity. Yea, so it wld not be good at all.

89 2018-12-31 16:48:53 “With losses hitting markets from stocks to commodities to bonds, many investors say they have reined in their optimism heading into the new year. That is especially true with data suggesting that growth around the world is starting to falter.”
-quote from Wall Street Journal
90 2018-12-31 16:47:38 Ironically, the only winning move for the US is the goal of Beijing anyway - a restructuring of the USD's reserve status such that the USD loses its monopoly on commodities & the UST its status as primary reserve asset.

93 2018-12-31 16:09:06 O mais Corrupto do mundo, se aproveitou da alta demanda por commodities e esqueceu de governar e só focou no poder. Hoje temos 60 mil assassinados, pior Crise da história, 12 milhões de desempregados e #LulaContinuaPresoBabaca

117 2018-12-31 14:46:29 Fuck that. You know what happens to your scholarship if you get injured and can't play? It disappears. Players are commodities to these schools and teams, they should all leave as soon as their draft stock is high and do everything to get paid.
118 2018-12-31 14:46:09 @narendramodi @kailashkandpal1 @NupurSharmaBJP can someone make a comparison sheet of prices of various commodities like pulses fuel vegetables etc of 2005,  2014 and present rates. It will help the voters to decide
119 2018-12-31 14:42:41 I'm blown away by the stupid comments. 
Pipe lines are a necessity in this day and age. They are a  safer way to transport our commodities to a world that still runs on fossil fuels and will continue to for the foreseeable future. 
So shut up, ride your bike idiots.

121 2018-12-31 14:40:18 Shows like this. Is it correct?  My manager said that there will more taxes for commodities so just wanted to confirm
122 2018-12-31 14:39:07 Under neoliberalism, people become commodities. We have a name for such people. They are called slaves.
123 2018-12-31 14:27:20 These are dispensable commodities for the “Islamic Republic of Pakistan”
124 2018-12-31 14:25:03 Yes, the State relies entirely on it's actuaries and fiduciary advisors. Citizens have become commodities and units of production. I've no doubt that figures involved in the SPA and projections of "savings" include "acceptable" early mortality rates.
125 2018-12-31 14:23:36 Btw, it's problematic whether alternative sources of these commodities are necessarily "lower quality." It's also worth asking if American producers have they staying power to survive the strategy you outline. Some will, but how many don't?
126 2018-12-31 14:20:57 Imagine everyone has access to trading any and all stocks, commodities and financial instruments, from anywhere in the world, in real time, 24/7.
127 2018-12-31 14:14:13 Hmmm...that period where you have to queue to buy “essential commodities “ from agency of govt (rice, sugar, salt etc)
128 2018-12-31 14:12:26 True this is Nota fence sitter - enjoying development and decreased prices of commodities / Petrol / gas / potato /onion / dals /income tax / cheaper Internet / great Roads Railways ETC . BUT still disgruntled & ADHD .

130 2018-12-31 13:56:17 Lock, Haskins, and Jones are all going to be hot commodities. With 5-6 teams possibly looking for a QB (jac, tb, nyg, was, cin, den) I'd love to see the #Raiders create a bidding war and trade back and aquire maybe another 1st Rd pick next year or another 2nd rounder this year.

138 2018-12-31 12:46:53 AIMWPLB says Triple Talaq bill will ruin the families.  What is the remedy when life of women of this community is ruined? Does the Board think women are slaves or commodities?
139 2018-12-31 12:41:59 “Commodification of whiteness” ... that’s an interesting and telling term. Certainly white people are high-value commodities while PoC’s commodity fluctuates but most are disposable. It’s sad to view everyone in this manner, though.

144 2018-12-31 12:29:30 I hope they asked how he’s enjoying fun times in Venezuela.  

He always has a feeble misdirecting excuse “some progress has been made, but the leaders are corrupt and they relied too much on commodities”.  

How about socialism fails? Every time. It’s his misery.
145 2018-12-31 12:27:43 It’s not all about the US.   China and Europe are also in bear markets. As are oil and commodities.  China, the world’s growth engine is under attack. Europe is floundering.   The US is clearly late cycle. Trumps in the White House.
146 2018-12-31 12:18:38 The queue for essential commodities started in 1984 and Buhari was head of state then. We used to queue at Leventis Store by the current Suya Spot at Akerele Surulere to purchase bathing soap and beverages. Buhari set Nigeria back by 3  decades by that singular coup d'etat
147 2018-12-31 12:14:49 i'm so tired of beauty having any sort of standard and also being intrinsically tied to commodities bro
148 2018-12-31 12:08:03 They may raise the rate hence the reason I took a 5 yr fixed on mortgage, however Far East has a lot to say about the strength of the dollar so time will tell, scary time for investors. May see people going for traditional commodities like gold due to the erratic  market

167 2018-12-31 09:16:18 The tendency is to remove everything human from life and language, moving us towards a meaningless market that abstracts away cultural value, where everything exists equivalently as commodities. Gender is of course not allowed in this grid, being an obstacle to amoral money-flow.

173 2018-12-31 08:49:14 Hay que usar commodities para comparar. En tema de sueldos y pasajes hay muchas variables de subsidios y cargas sociales distintas. Deberías usar el indice Big Mac y los sueldos de empleados de Mc Donald's. Sería más justa la comparación.
174 2018-12-31 08:31:09 Babangida toppled PMB because of massive corruption and hunger. People lined up for food items such as sugar and this brought about the phrase 'Essential commodities'
175 2018-12-31 08:29:46 A jerrycan of water at domestic rate is about 83shs. The recommendes price of water at a public pipe in communities is 25shs. When you compare this to other commodities on the market that we consume, water is cheap. It's just a perception we need to change jointly. 1/2 @NWSCMD

178 2018-12-31 08:27:41 Which jubilation. The era of queues for food items in Buhari's regime cannot be forgotten and started the phrase 'Essential commodities'. Hence the jubilation when Babangida toppled him
179 2018-12-31 08:24:59 Actually the queues for sugar started with PMB. That brought the phrase 'Essential commodities'. He banned importation of sugar, giving Dangote monopoly.
180 2018-12-31 08:21:02 What's funny about this line of reasoning is that it extends to the commodities that libertarians tend to love as well. Particularly gold. When you talk about gold as a store of value you're talking about its value in monetary terms. But then you say that fiat money is useless.

232 2018-12-31 02:59:45 Our intention is not and never will be to treat children as “commodities” but we shouldn’t be plunged into poverty because we want to foster and help children. Many carers are really struggling financially, this places their young people at risk of placement breakdowns.
233 2018-12-31 02:59:24 And If you want the whole chicken you'll have to look into the commodities market, a fine place to get the bird.
234 2018-12-31 02:43:03 everybody dedicate a few rips of untaxed agricultural commodities for the real mvp maxcj for running a tight ship on the aud stream every night
235 2018-12-31 02:16:32 2018: Investment highlights:

- invested over £10,000 forming a diversified portfolio of mutual & index funds, individual shares &commodities.

2019 investment goals:

236 2018-12-31 02:16:18 I know the reality, and it is absolutely awful, but I don't think it justifies treating children as commodities.
237 2018-12-31 02:16:11 É VERDADE ! CRISE COM  A CHINA, MAIOR IMPORTADOR DE COMMODITIES DO BRASIL, CRISE COM O MUNDO ÁRABE , MAIOR CONSUMIDOR DE AVES DO BRASIL, CRIISE COM A EUROPA CANCELADO A COP DO CLIMA, CRISE COM OS PAISES DA AMERICA DO SUL. ACREDITANDO NOS LOUCOS TRUMP E NATHANYAHU!!! EITA BURRO!
238 2018-12-31 02:08:22 Life would be so much better if corporations didn't have to have their noses stuck in the manure of their treatment of workers and the environment. They are too often  treated as just more commodities in the pursuit of production & profit.

Appreciate your caring.
239 2018-12-31 02:06:26 You can’t argue bureaucracy can’t run public health when apparently it can run billion$ arsenals & armies. That’s a #contrick Armies priority is defending land & commodities not the public. High population loss is easily absorbed but loss of productive land & commodities not.
240 2018-12-31 01:46:43 commodities are my great love
241 2018-12-31 01:44:14 Soybeans are one of the top three crop commodities in cash receipts for Arkansas farmers, generating about $1.7 billion annually. 30 to 40% of all US soybeans are exported.  Arkansas' bean producing counties overwhelmingly voted for DT, in a sea of adjoining red counties. #dealt
242 2018-12-31 01:39:00 Fully agree with you. In addition he also mix up fake commodities to earn more though many times he has been caught.
243 2018-12-31 01:30:07 This is unfortunately due to Avinor claiming so much of the airport stores revenues that they have to push insane prices on even the simplest commodities.
244 2018-12-31 01:20:22 It is literally a matter of Chinese national security to be able to buy commodities in CNY.  If they don't, they will suffer the fate of 1989 USSR or 1997 SE Asia or 2001 Argentina, etc.
245 2018-12-31 01:19:21 They tried. Reiff wasnt their first choice. It's just unfortunate how it's turned out. Pro Bowl Tackles aren't hot commodities. There's a handful of them. You're right, prioritizing Defense has had an effect on that as well.
246 2018-12-31 01:19:02 Large scale use of animals as commodities is definitely one thing I vehemently oppose.
They should be used sparingly for nutritionals needs.
I would love to see a ban on all ads featuring meat products.
It's revulsive.  No, I'm not vegetarian, but hate animal abuse.
247 2018-12-31 01:10:31 Por favaaaaar!!! Cállate la boca y busca trabajo. No quiero pagarte de mis impuestos!!!!! Inmorales, chorros, corruptos, mentirosos! Desperdiciaron el mejor momento de los commodities!!! Podríamos haber salido del agujero peroncho, pero no! Se afanaron todo!!! HDRMP!!!
248 2018-12-31 01:07:23 Já fez muitas operações fora dos ensinamentos clássicos dele próprio. Em commodities, moedas, derivativos, etc.
249 2018-12-31 00:48:16 I guess they will do without Soya. Pigs and poultry may grow slower and food will cost more but it is a small price to pay for good, clean, lower risk food. Sometime, somewhere, and hopefully soon,  farmers will be properly paid to produce food, and not commodities.
250 2018-12-31 00:45:14 Congratulations!  Thank you to you & your team for your hard work,
perseverance, abilities & acumen.
Let's see a new time of peace & care of the environment.
PS. My one displeasure, is using animals as commodities.  It doesn't respect life.
Shd be only necessary consumption. 
251 2018-12-31 00:43:44 Animals,  especially pets, in the US are treated as commodities, to be bought and sold, like a can of peas and their treatment is not much better, when ppl get tired of them, just dump them into the trash.
252 2018-12-31 00:39:54 Some commodities we use everyday will probably lead to unforeseen health problems in the the future
253 2018-12-31 00:34:52 I'm a proprietary commodities trader. I trade my own account. I also offer a newsletter service for grains and livestock. Thanks!

255 2018-12-31 00:20:49 Too bad, its the Rakyat, esp the Felda's 'peneroka' themselves who had been used as the pawn. Whilst the peneroka are suffering from the drop of commodities' value & prices, these PH politicians are washing their hands !
256 2018-12-31 00:12:28 Uribe no fue capaz ni de acabar al minúsculo EPL y dejó las ciudades del país llenas de BACRIM.

Para mi con Pastrana uno de los peores y más INEPTOS presidentes. Derrochó todo el boom petrolero y de los demás commodities.
No hizo ni una autopista, puerto, ni una Universidad.
257 2018-12-31 00:08:48 So include land ownership and all commodities! And a shitload of people to do all the dirty stuff. 
Fodder for a war if necessary? Hmm, less these days, only if they die, else they return f**kd up and are a drain on wealth.
258 2018-12-31 00:02:23 ¿Preguntas sobre cómo se establece el precio del #petro? El precio del petro para esta 1edición se ha referenciado en el valor de venta en los mercados internacionales de los recursos que forman parte de nuestra canasta de #Commodities: petróleo, oro, hierro y diamante.
