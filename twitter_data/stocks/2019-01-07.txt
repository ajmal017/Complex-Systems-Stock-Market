0 2019-01-07 23:59:00 I did the same with my friends, but really, to place everything would take a considerable ammount of time, so we didn't really play that much. This Mattel colab really is bringing childhood memories. Can you believe how investors jumped to buy stocks?
1 2019-01-07 23:58:40 Yea so guy pumping shitty weed penny stocks is an expert. Okay bro
2 2019-01-07 23:57:37 "BREAKING: Samsung sharply cuts Q4 earnings guidance, says results will be far below market expectations due to weakness in memory and increasing smartphone market competition"

Expect this in 2019... Good to buy stocks for earnings, huh?
3 2019-01-07 23:56:48 The right stocks and the finest be plans.
4 2019-01-07 23:56:35 Nope, has to do with the “in kind” creation/redemption mechanics of an etf... etf share trades for basket of stocks, not cash for stocks like a mf. No cash changes hands = no taxes on fund
5 2019-01-07 23:53:59 Build a pig barn and get back in the exporting game...way more fun than boring old stocks and bonds
6 2019-01-07 23:53:56 She is finished as an MP . Her constituency voted 54.6% to leave the EU against 45.4 remain. She does not represents their wishes and there have been moves to have her deselected. So heckling her or putting her in the stocks and pelting her with rotten tomatoes seems justified

8 2019-01-07 23:51:22 They may surprise you. The knowledge may be tucked away and just the exposure to the subject is good for them. I started buying stocks in middle school and 30 years later I'm still learning and investing.

14 2019-01-07 23:48:27 I would say that the older, more experienced Dems profit from the existing system.

@AOC represents a threat to that.

Or will older Dems put forward legislation making it illegal for them to profit on stocks based on foreknowledge of legislation (aka, insider trading).
15 2019-01-07 23:47:33 Also the majority of short sellers I. these small cap stocks only short because their gurus teach that. That's why in the past two years I've seen so many who used to short not even posting anymore about their PnLs or they dont even exist now. Probably cause they blew their accts
16 2019-01-07 23:47:09 So at the last MMOM, I was playing against Loadspiller (IC's player don't touch me on smashladder), last game I'm down 4-2 in stocks and then I hear the infamous "Fuck Puff" shout. I turn my head towards the crowd and proceed to stand up like Hbox, and win the set. Shit was hype
17 2019-01-07 23:45:22 Question:  if the main benefit of owning most foreign stocks comes from currency, why not own only the quality names?  Is there a reason to own European utilities or EM banks?
18 2019-01-07 23:45:00 Two weeks of rallies in U.S. stocks haven’t been enough to convince one of the widely followed Wall Street strategists to drop his cautious view on the market - Bloomberg
19 2019-01-07 23:44:54 Please explain.
Or is that just some kind of canned response?
Actually — don’t bother. I know you don’t know what you’re talking about.
The global recovery under Obama has been 10 years in the making.
The TrumpCrash will be caused by overvalued stocks—due to buybacks from taxcuts
