40 2018-10-24 23:57:31 i like scrambled egg unless it's almost runny
but ironically, i love a bit of a runny fried egg

but, preheated frying pan, butter (with drop of oil), then throw in drop of water & cover to steam top is my go-to with eggs now
41 2018-10-24 23:57:26 There it is. The oil story! You have told that one so many times! Tedious

46 2018-10-24 23:56:45 let me see soros spend his money investing in philanthropy. Koch and oil invests in crooked media, neo conservatism, nationalistic government
47 2018-10-24 23:56:32 Nope I did short $APC because Cramer mentioned there's proposed legislation in Colorado that could hurt them (I'm from Colorado and I'm pretty sure it's going to pass and just the fact that oil has peaked) but $STWD and $VZ both landed in the green today. 
48 2018-10-24 23:56:13 Essential oil (eucalyptus) + lavender epsom salt bath to sooth the soul....and my bones.
49 2018-10-24 23:56:07 Big oil has poured millions into this hoping to confuse and mislead voters.  I’m voting yes!
50 2018-10-24 23:56:06 わ〜〜〜〜〜〜いやった〜〜〜〜〜〜
51 2018-10-24 23:55:59 Yeah you’re good just try to do it when you can. Normally if you go in as soon as they open they’ll take you in. Depends where you go to get your oil change.
52 2018-10-24 23:55:43 The amount of stupid things i coulda bought instead of oil change things , like a plane ticket to go fuck myself
53 2018-10-24 23:55:37 Anibal Fernández habla de Oil Combustibles acusando al juez Cosentino, diciendo que "fueron a quebrar al grupo, una empresa que valía 500 millones terminaron vendiéndola en 85".
54 2018-10-24 23:55:22 To me, the funniest part is to see the Dems scream “get money out of politics!!” But then they are spending 3x as much on midterms and burning $100 million in Texas like it’s nothing. Such hypocrites. The lot of them. ALWAYS.
55 2018-10-24 23:55:18 Don’t use toothpaste! The fluoride in it is really bad for your body, your third eye & not to mention our water supply! Organic toothpaste is definitely the move or an alternative (coconut oil, sea salt, etc)
56 2018-10-24 23:55:17 Josh & Michael; good convo on valuation. 
RE:1990: few issues: , yes S&Ls/banks; but couple more :
  LBOs peaked in '89 & Drexel/HY market had trouble in '90 & big issue:  Iraq invasion of Kuwait; oil price jump & brief recession, stocks dropped sharply in late summer on that.
57 2018-10-24 23:55:09 Half a billion dollars is lost each year in the oil and corrosion industry, which is running on 30 year old software. 
@AIMAPS1
58 2018-10-24 23:55:06 Our per capita is the highest or one of the highest in the world.
So we all pay to subsidize the oil industry again.
59 2018-10-24 23:55:06 Let me spray a little air freshener in my car so you can't smell that oil burning off my exhaust manifold.
60 2018-10-24 23:55:05 Y’all paying over $100 for an oil change  fook that.
61 2018-10-24 23:54:54 We don’t want a severance tax. We don’t want money from oil & gas. We want CLEAN renewable energy and jobs!

74 2018-10-24 23:53:24 Don’t call yourself a foodie if you haven’t sat and calculated how much it would cost to fill a bathtub with truffle oil so you could sit in it and let it seep through your pores
75 2018-10-24 23:53:18 Wouldn't this be best selection,,,CBD oil? I suffer rare brain disease. Quite a few are finding successful pain relief.

81 2018-10-24 23:52:43 great reading this from a american, you know stuff. The answer for your question is OIL. I always ask myself why the US never did nothing to S.Arabia if they stand so much against "terrorists" and "injustice". And about the turkish man son, he is already a bilionaire right now.
82 2018-10-24 23:52:41 Kenny, in they chose to steal Scotlands future when they lied to us about oil in 1970's  McCrone Report.     Thats what is awful...
83 2018-10-24 23:52:37 If you were in Canada I'd tell you to get medical Marijuana oil
84 2018-10-24 23:52:31 Mmmmm  I love pasta!!

For us; things like spray oil for non-stick cooking, tomato paste, stock cubes and liquid, salt/pepper, tins of corn (it’s nicer IMO than the frozen stuff), tins of soup, I like to use onion flakes in some cooking...ummmm
85 2018-10-24 23:52:31 Welp! Time to get back at it in Amnesia! I have no oil for my lantern and I have to make it through a very dark corridor in the castle's cellar! Let's hope I survive it! #Monstrosities #twitchkittens #TNF
86 2018-10-24 23:52:26 I cooked the ribs in a pan with butter to get some oil out of em then after like 10 mins I put them in the crockpot with the pan still hot I added flour stirred that added a lil water seasoned & stirred that then put it in the crockpot let it cook a hour then tasted the gravy 
87 2018-10-24 23:52:23 Hunnigan, could you check and see if the BSAA has any units near the oil field?
88 2018-10-24 23:52:18 Can you use castor oil on eyelashes? I’d like mine to be thicker but Latisse-type products give me the willies.

97 2018-10-24 23:51:03 Yes farmers are accountable for livestock emissions as shown but we can’t bear the burden of consumer emissions when they consume food, that is an end user cost.

It would be like asking the oil companies to pay your carbon tax at the pump for you when you fill up your car.
98 2018-10-24 23:51:02 @driveSRT @dodge i love my srt challenger. But honestly I’m growing tired of your dealerships in Nv when it comes to my service. My engine has had nothing but problems from day one. And now I’m being told my new engine that is a year old has an oil leak and it’s the wrong engine
99 2018-10-24 23:50:58 Seriously, peppermint, primrose oil supplements, and Tylenol are my best friends during PMS... chocolate, HOT bathes, and cuddles help too. 
100 2018-10-24 23:50:48 Shin: More than 90% of #NorthKorea trade is with China. As well, most of #DPRK's oil also comes from China. Chinese role very important.

109 2018-10-24 23:49:14 Because you’re bitching about paper products and gobbling the evil gasoline which, like other products comes from oil that you consume.
Energy is the only thing that will drive a modern economy and pull third world starvation into sustainable survival and recycle what we have.

114 2018-10-24 23:48:11 I mentioned some testicular chaffing to a cockney actor friend who suggested a lubricant. But it was terrible. It was Dyer bollock oil.

129 2018-10-24 23:46:16 Well, we will see what Q4 brings after the "kitchen sink" Q. I'll say this, EM can sure sell that snake oil.

140 2018-10-24 23:44:59 ((Exactly. Also, government bureaucrats aren't good at running businesses, so putting them in charge of a business leads to things like oil rigs that can't pump oil.
141 2018-10-24 23:44:58 It’s a start.   I tell you what.  2 to 1 neutral oil to any type of vinegar... plus a tsp of Dijon and whisk together w/ some salt and pepper and maybe a couple chopped fresh herbs?  You will Never go back to that bottled stuff.   Maybe slice up a Calabrian for heat?... oh man

151 2018-10-24 23:43:15 @nomadicrevery I'm tootie on neck oil. I came across, behave, a glitch
152 2018-10-24 23:43:04 How do you know it was oil?
153 2018-10-24 23:42:55 Pissed he’s been in oil for like 3 years. Haha
154 2018-10-24 23:42:55 Aha / bha mantul nderr, sama pake fw nya wardah yg perfect bright oil control
155 2018-10-24 23:42:54 Ya vendrá el chupa cabra y cuñados , y con sierra oil . clonará la gallina de bronce..
156 2018-10-24 23:42:43 Why don't we just wait until we know what happened instead of jumping around like oil in a hot skillet? You'll know more about these packages and to whom and where they were sent very soon. And most likely, who walked these in since they were not postmarked.
157 2018-10-24 23:42:32 Love when I get new shirts at work they be so sharp and crisp but I’ll probably be looking like I took an oil bath by the end of the shift 
158 2018-10-24 23:42:31 You’re in oil? What do you do?
159 2018-10-24 23:42:12 I actually see it as a social issue too. If we weren’t relying on oil so much then we’d be able to cut ties w Saudi
160 2018-10-24 23:41:53 From who a reality TV star? Also, oil supply is questionable.
161 2018-10-24 23:41:47 pink oil?? why you doing your daughter like that???? go through the thread and find some products to give her that moisturized hair
162 2018-10-24 23:41:43 Saudi’s story is laughable! Yet we buy their oil over ours! Really unbelievable. We are in a pit of poop in this country.
163 2018-10-24 23:41:10 Hahahahahaha lol mom just bought 30liters of oil idk what the hell came to her mind. One year supply ma?
164 2018-10-24 23:40:52 Dude, Filipinos are the best I swear. Getting my oil changed at a Filipino-family run place, and they basically knocked off about $100 of my total price 
165 2018-10-24 23:40:42 God imagine if someone told him that Venezuela’s economy remains market based & private sector dominated & was more so under Chavez than under Madura who is on the brink of fighting a civil war due to volatile oil prices & crippling trade embargoes.
166 2018-10-24 23:40:38 On a scale of 1 to dead, how bad is it to have synthetic motor oil in your mouth? 

Asking for me because I went to get my oil changed and they sprayed me in the face with oil.
167 2018-10-24 23:40:28 jkenney: RT OilsandsAction:  Heavy oil price = $14.18 Heavy oil price = $72.23 Heavy oil price = $72.12 Heavy oil price = $74.54 Heav…

172 2018-10-24 23:39:41 I'm going to vote for the party that guarantees health care,  which one is that?

uhh

OK, which party is fighting against the oil companies and their pipelines?

well

ok I'll vote for that party that wants to help with the massibe student loan debt that will tank the economy.
173 2018-10-24 23:39:32 is that why my CAT stock is tanking and at least 50 companies have stated they did not meet wall street expectations due to tariffs?  you only care about a uneducated coal miners and the oil industry that are not where the future is.  let's get elected on lies. no future.
174 2018-10-24 23:39:28 Nick started going on the keto diet, and now our place smells like bacon grease and coconut oil.... keto ruins lives, people.
175 2018-10-24 23:39:26 I just wanna shower, oil myself And go to bed.
176 2018-10-24 23:39:07 Do you use oil of oregano?
177 2018-10-24 23:39:04 "In family life, quarrels are inevitable and that makes a friction, but love is the oil that eases this  friction, the cement that binds closer together and the music that brings harmony."

178 2018-10-24 23:38:58 Arn, good point. I am certainly skeptical of big oil’s concerns for public safety. But I’m hardly qualified to argue the merits of the size of setbacks and I try not to columnize on things I don’t know enough about.
179 2018-10-24 23:38:48 Oil. We're between Iran (who we lost by supporting a corrupt Monarchy and who practice Shia Islam) and the Saudi & other corrupt Monarchies in the area for our national interest (oil).  Plus, 40,000 to 1,000,000 jobs selling our hi-tech weapons they can use on us later.
180 2018-10-24 23:38:46 olive oil贅沢使い(*д*)
181 2018-10-24 23:38:43 why not? it will encourage people to drive more fuel efficient vehicles, coal plants, oil/gas industry to reduce their emissions etc
182 2018-10-24 23:38:37 The only factor what #India, which favours after the American equity fall is early morning oil prices saw a further cut, stable dollar rupee and a drop in Us10 years bond prices.. NEGATIVES ARE A BIT HIGHER DOLLAR INDEX AND MARGIN TRIGGERS IN  equities
183 2018-10-24 23:38:18 He is a snake oil sells man taking orders from Putin. #opioidcrisis you know people that say they don’t drink nor take any drugs I think they need to maybe become smarter? #AlSaudCrimeFamily
184 2018-10-24 23:38:15 Pls stop putting coconut oil anywhere :)
185 2018-10-24 23:37:50 The Gulf of Mexico - between 37,000 to 113,000 liters (8,140 to 24,860 gallons) of oil is And has been leaking daily from multiple wells around a drilling platform since 2004 sixteen miles from the Louisiana coast
186 2018-10-24 23:37:41 Not all men are created equal. Some make better choices than others. Don't compare dogs to men. That's like comparing water to oil. Dumb bitches. I swear.
187 2018-10-24 23:37:40 Instead of using an oil blotting sheet, I used a newspaper instead today
188 2018-10-24 23:37:30 ..and our oil,gas,62% of UK fisheries,whisky,gin,16% of englands electricity,good luck in little england after brexit,you're going to need it...Nigel..what what old chap.

191 2018-10-24 23:37:01 Depends. Usually this is due to oil build up on the inner face of the fabric (i.e. garment was not washed frequently enough). Best bet for this is to cut out & replace the affected area(s). Not easy in most cases (Is it around the neck/shoulder seams?). (Adds seams of course.)
192 2018-10-24 23:36:52 Satan is alive and well in Washington D.C.!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal! Drones are spying on me and my dad!
193 2018-10-24 23:36:44 @BetoORourke & @tedcruz  are the example of America's Problem. #Beto be like fuck the rich ass oil companies in Texas and tax they ass more so I can use $ for better things. Cruz be like fuck that and your better things,rich ass oil companies pay better and R lesser of a problem.
194 2018-10-24 23:36:37 @actuphigher man get an oil change CARTER is driving nigga!
195 2018-10-24 23:36:36 Steal a bottle of the essential oil Thieves
196 2018-10-24 23:36:29 Goose fat is great, and v. tasty! But with smoke, it depends on if it is the actual fat that is burning or something else in it. Oxidative resistance is a better factor to look at (EVOO is second to coconut oil among plant fats, but has less total polar compounds after cooking).
197 2018-10-24 23:36:23 Soap , face wash, coconut oil but will not even use their shampoo again...I dont know where they went wrong @_OneNaMiLL_

201 2018-10-24 23:34:29 in other news that nobody wants to hear, my Ford dealer actually kept an appointment today; changed my oil in a fairly reasonable amount of time for a reasonable price. not bad.

204 2018-10-24 23:33:05 You need to learn to read.  @DianeMariePosts posited that the oil sands have reduced emissions because of the NDP carbon tax. That has been industry driven, not consumer tax driven.  Your "free" shower heads and light bulbs aren't really oil sands related, are they?  #idiot
205 2018-10-24 23:33:02 The same reason why, when TSA takes your 4oz bottle of shave oil from U because it is .2 oz over limit, they throw the deadly bottle into a giant drum with hundreds of other bottles just like it, right next to the long line of people waiting to get radiated in the name of safety

208 2018-10-24 23:32:19 Hair Mask = Eggs, Mayo, Jamaican Castor Oil, Olive Oil, and Wild Growth 
209 2018-10-24 23:32:03 Where's your support for the oil industry Max, Oh that's right you are a Quebec politician, wouldn't want to bring that up.
210 2018-10-24 23:31:58 CASTOR OIL AND ALOE VERA GEL     i swear, THIS STUFF WORKS, i tried it, it’s honestly the best.. simply mix the two together, add it to your eyelashes with an old mascara brush (clean)  and leave it on over night than wash off in the morning..
211 2018-10-24 23:31:53 The Saudi Arabia version of Islam, Wahhabi Islam, is the most fundamentalist strain of the religion. The relationship that the US have with the Saudis is based entirely on money.. They sell oil to the US, the US sell them weapons. They both pretend to have a special relationship.
212 2018-10-24 23:31:51 I am. Imma get some beard oil lol

215 2018-10-24 23:31:21 Rep. Russell's answer on PAC money basically admits that he's acting on behalf of oil corporations. That's a strange thing to be proud of. #FlipThe5th #OK5Debate.
216 2018-10-24 23:31:20 When they piss him off and he goes after them, until then hey if it energizes their xenophobic base and they can keep their hands clean, as they have been with the NRA and big oil for years, clean palms but dirty nails

219 2018-10-24 23:31:12 Aye all that oil and yet many of our fellow citizens rely on food banks, how many other oil producing countries can boast that eh!!!!!!!
220 2018-10-24 23:31:07 And Cadillacs come with Cadillac care. All service including oil changes are included the first for years.
221 2018-10-24 23:31:03 This guy really is skin crawling creepy…. Not sure how anyone could ever vote for him.  Something is wrong in Texas.  Oil leaching into the water or something.

226 2018-10-24 23:30:19 We grumble at times at the highest fuel prices in North America. But we put our foot down to a pipeline being twinned to Westgate, for the purpose of shipping oil by oil tanker through Metro Vancouver to Asia. How is @gmbutts going to pay the same “price on pollution” for that?

237 2018-10-24 23:29:07 some people swear by the high CBD strains and others swear by just CBD oil. Neither of which really get you high

243 2018-10-24 23:27:38 You are pointing out the obvious again. NDP and Liberals don't want a western oil industry, it doesn't do much for eastern Canada. Separation is our only choice, Ottawa will not look after Sask and Alberta.

251 2018-10-24 23:26:25 That's assuming he'll ever have a good case to make. Serioisly doubtful that @realDonaldTrump believes he has a good case to make on anything. It's all shyster work, snake oil sales.
252 2018-10-24 23:26:25 By being awol on oil and gas and fracking in neighborhoods - the biggest environmental and climate issue in the state - mainstream enviro groups ceded issue to Colorado Rising which has guts to rise up for residents.

Reason? Outside money with outside agendas fund Big Green.
253 2018-10-24 23:26:23 Get lavender essential oil
254 2018-10-24 23:26:21 @calgarytransit 2. Bus 8086 needs some maintenance, the bus had some kind of spill (oil... I think)! It was parked at St. John Brebeuf School @ Northland Dr NW. Firefighters had to respond, and use some kind of powder to clear the spill!
255 2018-10-24 23:26:20 Everything I read seemed to say I over mixed the stuff so the olive oil broke down and was bitter, but idk.

257 2018-10-24 23:26:04 Average BMI in the study was 19.4.   60-80g total fat.
Participants are introduced to palm oil, average LDL levels was 97 mg/dL, coconut oil raised it to 133 mg/dL, corn oil reduced it to 64.5 mg/dL, that's nearly double or even triple what is predicted by Mensink calculations.
258 2018-10-24 23:25:59 It’s the oil, gets everywhere
259 2018-10-24 23:25:57 I’m no VC but I’ll sign up for the oil change!
260 2018-10-24 23:25:53 And O’Rourke will vote to fling open our borders, establish sanctuaries for illegals, and impose a devastating $10 a barrel tax on oil. O’Rourke talks a good game, but he evaded even the simplest question on how he will pay for his healthcare fantasy 
261 2018-10-24 23:25:49 it's funny how when i talk about grape seed oil, the natural assumption is that im talking about cooking instead of using it for the hair
262 2018-10-24 23:25:44 Big oil? The largest Canadian based company does 600k barrels a day and the drop off is steep.

269 2018-10-24 23:24:04 You make a good and rather obvious point.

The @FIIKSA and @SaudiVision2030 works on diversifying the Saudi economy off of Oil dependency.

We've been working on this transformation plan for the past several years.
270 2018-10-24 23:23:53 You are more unfortunate than unfortunate itself
271 2018-10-24 23:23:47 You people have no clue why the market is selling off.. I will try to help: the market is trying to price in a Trump Impeachment. You will continue seeing a downward spiral until the uncertainty of the House  is resolved. It’s not recession, interest rates, oil or earnings.
272 2018-10-24 23:23:41 Not all industry is as radioactive as the oil and gas industry though is it? I notice you avoided tackling THAT point! Ha!

A long walk.

What calmed him? socks. on. his. paws.

276 2018-10-24 23:23:24 They should change their name to "Snake Oil Weekly"

289 2018-10-24 23:21:59 You can tell I know precious little about the oil industry but wouldn't that make sense. Every fan gets a carbon tax rebate, Neil Young rants about the oil sands. That's what I call a great night in Ice District.
290 2018-10-24 23:21:37 "" Democratic candidates are no longer afraid of embracing the war on coal and oil ""

Good. 

Americans need to see who has their back and who does not.

300 2018-10-24 23:20:18 We’re already leaving harmful stuff from coal and oil drilling and gas drilling that will be in the biosphere for a really long time and we don’t even think about it.

Nuclear waste is peanuts in comparison.

306 2018-10-24 23:19:21 if we don't make enough money and, worst, if we spend our money to IMPORT oil, we will NEVER be able to invest in different resources! How is that so difficult to get it? Is that so difficult to understand that we are also under threats from U.S. and Arabs?

311 2018-10-24 23:18:41 Bullshit, we would be ripped off through exportation. It would be better to leave the oil and gas where it is and search for other, better ways to energize NZ people!
312 2018-10-24 23:18:40 Did you get any oil ?

316 2018-10-24 23:18:13 Alas, I remember when stock valuations were usually reflective of real business results....and when OPEC shut off our oil. 
317 2018-10-24 23:18:08 If a tax needs to be explained it has to be a trick! Snake Oil Politics by Trudeau and McKenna is so laughable!
318 2018-10-24 23:18:08 This $tsx oil has really taken people for a ride to the downside. Just absolutely spilling its bloody guts everywhere. Please stop the bleeding before this whole CDN economy falls to its knees.  $oil.
319 2018-10-24 23:18:04 How about we buy responsibly produced oil, say  from the most stringently regulated producers on Earth ? Like in Alberta ?

327 2018-10-24 23:16:59 Moisturel lotion ! It’s oil free so you can use it on your face without breaking out
328 2018-10-24 23:16:55 I just got my nails done and when she was going to massage my hands I asked her if she could use a drop of my Lavender Oil with the lotion. She did and then 5 min later she told me she had bad anxiety all day and it was gone from using the Lavender! Love hearing things like this

337 2018-10-24 23:16:11 “American energy dominance” is bull shit made up by Zinke and the Trump Admin to give them an excuse for destroying more of our environment. We don’t need more oil and gas, we have plenty, and the pristine environment you are opening up to be spoiled can never be replaced!
338 2018-10-24 23:16:07 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
339 2018-10-24 23:16:06 It's what happens when you spend money during a boom rather than investing money during a boom, Compare Australia to Venezuela. Venezuela pissed away money during their oil boom while Australia saved and invested money during their mining boom.
340 2018-10-24 23:16:05 Churchill said that the Saudis were very bloodthirsty, even back before the oil arrived.
341 2018-10-24 23:16:03 You could try guided meditation, or putting on a relaxing sound like ocean waves or light rain. If you can get CBD oil that helps a lot too

347 2018-10-24 23:15:36 Real meaningful change:
-Encourage manufacturing of EVs (provide tax breaks for EV makers + credits for buyers)
-Build more charging stations
-Move towards greener power (nuclear + solar)
-Use oil $$ to subsidize green initiatives + fund research of invasive species (pine beetle)
348 2018-10-24 23:15:33 Lmao the place my cousin got her car from does her oil & they haven’t been putting enough oil in it & blamed it on her for not checking it  we deadass check it ( my dad was a mechanic ) turns out they didn’t put enough oil but tried to pin it on her.

351 2018-10-24 23:15:25 More restaurants need to educate their staff on what their ingredients are. I'm allergic to canola oil. And some other type of spice (that I've been trying to pinpoint). And they all just say to look it up online or that they just don't know.
352 2018-10-24 23:15:22 You can read If Oil is amplified and Atlantic A mutual benefit, but it to "incomplete burning" (NAPALM) and with the precambian
353 2018-10-24 23:15:12 I’ve been thinking about this for weeks. Legislators around a round table, low lights, ties loose, smoking cigs with oil reps, “how can we get them to allow offshore drilling?”

367 2018-10-24 23:12:59 I figure tomorrow we will be right back up. The big story is the sell off in $WTI. It was getting really ahead of itself and I thought a sell off was imminent. Those calls of oil at $200 were ridiculous. Without a huge supply disruption it won't happen.

374 2018-10-24 23:12:31 Canada is basically putting itself out of business while world oi demand continues to grow. Our government has sold us out to the US who buys our oil for $25 and sells it at $70. You are an idiot and a traitor. Is the US paying you as well as Trudeau and McKenna?
375 2018-10-24 23:12:08 Were they Saudi's or not? Saudi religious leaders are obviously teaching something that is driving their citizens to do terrorism. A US report. Ha. You believe that report? I have a bridge for sale. The US government lies to protect its oil interests. We get no oil from Iran. 1+1
376 2018-10-24 23:12:07 The state of New York has taken legal action against ExxonMobil, accusing the oil giant of misleading investors about the risks of climate change to its business.

379 2018-10-24 23:11:54 Don’t get me wrong, this murder is disgusting, but why the uproar now about Saudi Arabia? The treatment towards women is incomprehensible... So we will import their oil, while they treat women like garbage? We are better than this , Canada.

395 2018-10-24 23:10:27 The US authorities want the alliance with Saudi Arabia to maintain the stability of the global price of oil and to assist in their confrontation with Iran. As against that, the murder does not really count, unfortunately.
396 2018-10-24 23:10:22 No, you could produce hydrogen with the current oil infrastructure. Drastically reducing co2 emissions by reducing gas in a car. Gas stations can easily be converted for hydrogen vs 8 hour recharge time. And I'd get about 6x as far. Goal isn't perfection it's reduction.

There are cheap stocks out there.
401 2018-10-24 23:10:00 Over the last 10 years the US has become the world largest fossil fuel producer. In addition you buy all Canada’s oil at $25 while WTI price is $70 and you fund protests to stop pipelines so we can’t export to others. @cathmckenna Canada govt has sold Canada out to the US.
402 2018-10-24 23:09:52 The government really trying to get people to vote yes on vaping indoors so they can drill for oil, like how does that correlate into one question???

427 2018-10-24 23:06:35 @ericnuttall  Thoughts for the day?  Seriously, how long can the market fade oil, let alone E&P's? As you are one of the few professional managed money energy investors left standing, today would make a great day for some wise(r) words than the panic that has taken hold.
428 2018-10-24 23:06:23 My crystal ball won’t tell me what the high will be, however my gut is telling me that the major correction will happen in Jan. Oil will trend toward $100 and hopefully corn starts moving to $5 by March. Look for housing in Canada to take a big jump off the ledge in Jan.
429 2018-10-24 23:06:19 With all of the O2 sensors, synthetic engine oil, modern spark plugs, and many more auto advances you do NOT need to let your car warm up unless it is below freezing outside. 

Just a PSA but feel free to do some research on it.
430 2018-10-24 23:06:17 Nanaimo is full of hard working people. Your running the wrong platform. People need less taxes+more jobs. Instead your talking about housing and oil spills as if Nanaimo people are hippes from Vancouver? Do people really want gas prices to go up more as you tax us to death?

435 2018-10-24 23:05:07 Was reading recipes and it's pretty much hot sauce with melted butter. (Or oil)

438 2018-10-24 23:04:47 and then they say they want extra ranch, and you bring them extra ranch. no that's not enough. you're so sick of this shit. you put it in the big soup bowl. great, they exclaim, their tiny beady eyes behind the rolls of fat glistening with glee or maybe oil. they drink it. my god

445 2018-10-24 23:03:44 ... energy.  Thinking coal is the future makes me think that he'll try to return us to whale oil next.  Trump is right about working on trade and putting America first.  He is completely ignorant if he thinks an isolation policy is health for our country.  Dems are ignorant if ..
446 2018-10-24 23:03:44 The face of a snake oil salesman.
447 2018-10-24 23:03:27 What's worse is that there is nothing indicating a maga Patriot, white or otherwise sent those failed "bombs" they had isis flag stickers on them for Christ sake, I don't know of any Islamic terrorist centapedes my dude. Theu two ideas are oil and water.
448 2018-10-24 23:03:17 this one's simple tbh. cook sausages whole, then slice. heat a pan with lots of olive oil and toast the sausage. add cut cherry tomatoes, garlic, banana peppers, basil, and salt/pepper, and cook just a little. add cooked pasta last. pasta without a full sauce feels so Upscale
449 2018-10-24 23:02:56 John the saddest thing besides Khashoggi being killed by his own people! Is if Hillary had won the election in '16 especially with the lefts views on extracting oil here in the US there is no way they would of cut of Saudi Arabia from selling oil to the US or any serious sanction
450 2018-10-24 23:02:55 But it's going to be "clean oil", so it's ok.
451 2018-10-24 23:02:33 I remain deeply concerned about the longer term supply situation fro crude. IMO, unless LCO price rises above, and remains locked, above 80, we're just creating a stable supply crisis come 2022. I say lets avoid 200 oil later, and settle for 80 oil, now.
452 2018-10-24 23:02:26 Funniest part was CJ defending his tweet by saying it wasn’t about Connor as much as a comment on scoring depth of the Oil. Well damn, thanks CJ, we in Oil country weren’t aware of that after our 10+ yr rebuild, lol. I echo good job Gregor.
453 2018-10-24 23:02:21 4) This Turkey/Saudi thing... How true is it that MBS was assassinated in April? Then is it true a body double is in place? Within MBS’s Family has to exist extremely high chaos and MBS seems to have turned against Deep State. DS would love to get their hands on the oil?
454 2018-10-24 23:02:17 Its a weak and pathetic response, because the Saudi rats can halt the oil production. So, they stay silent. That's why we must get rid of the need for oil and gas, so these terrorist states can't take us hostage when shit hits the fan.
455 2018-10-24 23:02:12 God knows I'm no oil painting, but I do find Trump physically repulsive.  I mean seriously ugly.  How do people vote for that?
456 2018-10-24 23:01:59 all it’s missing is some black garlic oil & BAM! i think i’ll try to make some this weekend 
457 2018-10-24 23:01:44 If the suit is done properly, tearing at the neck really isn’t a big concern. IMHO the biggest downside is practicality: Takes a long time to get in (unless chlorinated) and getting out usually requires a shower (or lots of silicone oil). But worth it, just not as your only suit.
458 2018-10-24 23:01:26 it's always nice to see our oil purchase profits going to good use.
459 2018-10-24 23:01:22 Drove thro Chicago first thing this morning.. spent majority of the morning in Detroit now I’m in Monroe and Kokomo just had a service/oil change and I had a super nice (but fairly expensive) shower.. we good to go..

469 2018-10-24 22:59:50 Our oil industry employs 1000's of  Canadians & Americans. Our oil is produced at the highest industry standards on the planet-including OPEC members, while also being the most environmentally prudent. 

Rather get your oil from a country who beheads & women have no rights?

492 2018-10-24 22:55:51 I think I said that? "Not enuf oil". Its interesting that the wise said "Go buy oil". Salvation is free but a deeper life costs all that we have! So worth it.

503 2018-10-24 22:54:18 Only reason we supported Saudis was oil. They are a brutal primitive state financing extreme religion and terrorists. We opposed Iran because it’s stated hostility to Israel. Time to re-evaluate what is in our best interests

545 2018-10-24 22:48:13 China's play here is to attract foreign businesses and investment, and build up local skills/know-how to the detriment of the US. They will continue to woo US businesses as long as the US remains hostile... i.e. favouring oil, labour unions, litigious culture, etc
546 2018-10-24 22:48:11 If we have a crisis, funding might be hard to come by & those plays might suffer & get bought out as discounted prices.  Look at the oil crash a few years ago when shale plays when bust or got bought out for cheap.  Be careful

567 2018-10-24 22:45:40 Can only listen to sad music after both me and Katie’s cards combined got declined for my oil change 
568 2018-10-24 22:45:34 So ready to go home, put some coconut oil in my hair, take my pants off, make some tea and watch the whole Twilight series. And Matt better be down
569 2018-10-24 22:45:33 I thought I had one more free oil change and I called to make sure and I guess and I don’t and my oil light just came on for the first time in 3 years
570 2018-10-24 22:45:27 Dirty oil is from California
571 2018-10-24 22:45:20 I would be willing to pay a carbon tax if the result is energy Independence with no more oil from the world's worst human rights abusers.
572 2018-10-24 22:44:59 Cancel a $20 billion dollar sale, keep the oil in the ground and sell what you do take out at over 50% discount, add a new tax (carbon), and keep growing the deficit. Is there an accountant in the house?
573 2018-10-24 22:44:53 Nigeria was the world's largest producer of palm oil. Nigerians abandoned palm oil because of crude oil.
574 2018-10-24 22:44:41 Give us fat murderous barstards money cause our oil is running out.
575 2018-10-24 22:44:34 It depends. I go oil -> acrylic wash/weathering -> let dry for a couple days (just to be sure) -> careful application of plyurethane
576 2018-10-24 22:44:30 Look I'm no oil painting but some of these ppl need to spend more time getting into shape. Holy Crap

579 2018-10-24 22:44:08 Any turbocharged engine should not wait more than 5,000 miles between oil changes. 3,000 is being safe and preventative and personally how i roll.
580 2018-10-24 22:44:01 Idk tbh. Intake looked fine, oil was good, hoses were all connected still. Hoping it wasn’t some dumb limp mode. I’m one of the few who hasn’t experienced limp mode in their Gen yet 
581 2018-10-24 22:44:00 Try the same thing with sausage, potatoes and veggies, just drizzle olive oil and season with Italian seasoning
582 2018-10-24 22:43:59 Just oil pulled for 40 minutes instead of my regular 20 so I better not wake up tmrw feeling like I can't breathe  I damn well mean it 
583 2018-10-24 22:43:56 Watching the story unfold about the father killing his two daughters and pregnant wife and putting them in the oil tanks..... this shit makes my heart ache.

588 2018-10-24 22:43:04 Well, you know Democrats, always loading up migrants with bombs to blow up all our Saudi oil deals.

594 2018-10-24 22:42:13 And someone who controls oil companies can rob the earth of...earth.
595 2018-10-24 22:41:56 I am pretty sure the oil companies lied.
596 2018-10-24 22:41:37 The abolishment of slavery was not as enforced as paying taxes. This is because “palm oil is taxed, and those taxes pay your salary and in the long run mine as well” (page 14). Essentially, without slavery the whole economy would be in shambles.

I was cooking. Took the top off the olive oil, went to put the olive oil away and I can’t find the top. Clear the counter. Nope. Check floor. No. Look in sink and garbage. No & no! In mounting desperation I dig through garbage again, look under rug. 1/2

621 2018-10-24 22:38:04 Yes, and for fuck's sake you use castor oil in making soap.  Unless the box it came in also had a person in it that popped out, went to your kitchen and extracted ricin from it and then force fed it to you, it's not even close to equivalent to having a BOMB sent to you.

625 2018-10-24 22:37:18 Do you mean the mineral oil argument or just that there might be some kink somewhere?  I think they have a lot of margin for error with the top line as strong as it is.  My biggest concern has been IP

639 2018-10-24 22:34:43 It will be more beneficiary if you reduce and control the Oil price.
640 2018-10-24 22:34:39 - you have to differentiate between what he controls and what he cannot controls.  The tariffs are completely under his control.  Therefore, the comparison is not acceptable,
Only if he uses the navy to blockade Iranian ports, he will achieve the zero oil exports

642 2018-10-24 22:34:09 What do we produce/manufacture/export as a nation to claim our economy was strong?

We just drilled oil, sold it and shared the money rejoicing that there was money in the system.

Oil prices fall and our folly is exposed.........

644 2018-10-24 22:33:59 Saudi should be completely shunned, cut off. Stuff their oil and our pandering to them for it. Let's adapt to a life without Saudi oil. It's possible. The main inhibitor is fat cats making a fortune from the trade.
645 2018-10-24 22:33:53 Just shatter a full cartridge of oil.... I’m hurt
646 2018-10-24 22:33:49 Maybe if trump would stop destroying their homelands for oil and gold they won't risk their lives to get to safety.
647 2018-10-24 22:33:30 Also, yes you can produce stuff without value. For example, fracking in Australia will generate lots of cheap, profitable oil, but it will also taint the aquifers that tens of thousands of people rely on for water. In the long run, this is deeply damaging.

665 2018-10-24 22:30:42 Yes. The oil/bitumen producers don’t pay on the latent GHGs of their product, just on what was emitted by consumption during production.  You and I in our gas burning vehicle emit most of the GHGs per gallon and should pay the bulk of the tax, I would hope.
666 2018-10-24 22:30:32 We're claiming strong economy, we produce nothing. We just drill oil, sell it and use the money to import everything. 

Oil prices fall and immediately, our true situation is exposed.

716 2018-10-24 22:24:05 You can't totally blame Chavez. Those guys wanted to steer some oil $$ back to internal investments instead of the battening ticks of Wall Street. For this sin, they are subjected to economic punishment.

719 2018-10-24 22:23:48 Obviously tankers pollute, but if you think pipelines and oil from Canada fit into a picture where we actually address climate change then you obviously haven't read the scientific consensus.

725 2018-10-24 22:22:52 Even the World Bank admits climate change exists and is related to human behavior. I am wondering what is wrong with doing things smarter and cleaner anyway? Unless oil companies choose to politicize it and recruit weak-minded people to be their apostles.

735 2018-10-24 22:21:25 @StanBushTV THANK YOU so much for your report on Prop 112 on Monday. It's about time someone actually talked to a real person who has been affected by the oil and gas industry. Oil & gas are turning northern CO into an industrial sinkhole, but no one covers it. So, thanks.
736 2018-10-24 22:21:21 I say piss them off enough so they will quit shipping us their oil.
737 2018-10-24 22:21:19 Is any among you afflicted? Let him pray. Is any merry? Let him sing psalms.
Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: 
Jas 5:13-14 KJV
738 2018-10-24 22:21:02 The parts department just told me that a guy came in asking if we sold longer engine oil dipsticks, because his didn't reach His oil anymore.

741 2018-10-24 22:20:33 That's not true, Saudis can produce, refine and transport a barrel of oil for the mere cost of $6~

So not only do we've the largest oil reserves but we also have the cheapest cost of production.

According to the IMF 2017 report, $80 is the breakeven price for Saudi sufficiency.

748 2018-10-24 22:19:33 Did you listen to VP Pence yesterday in the oval office with President Trump? Pence said the absurdity of blaming Venezuela for the caravan´s finance. Until when the non stop attacks against that country JUST because it has the LARGEST OIL RESERVE OF THE WORLD. Really. Enough.
749 2018-10-24 22:19:08 But Alberta is a thing... and so are oil sands. what little of Quebec I've seen (south of the river) looks like Cold Kansas.
750 2018-10-24 22:19:04 The can’t anymore than they can name a climate denying politician that isn’t taking money from big oil, big coal etc. it is all a push to keep using fossil fuels. Koch brothers put out newsletters saying global warming is caused by sunspots.

753 2018-10-24 22:18:54 It is yet another step in the right direction to prove to the doubters, haters, oil barons and the legacy automotive industry that EVs are the future. Even as the first profitable quarter in awhile, it is just the latest step in a much longer journey to get here.

755 2018-10-24 22:18:47 True. I did it because it's a forgotten point. Both sides of the Lib/Con fence have f'd up & paid billions. Yes! If we can buy a useless pipeline to give an oil company money to invest in the US then we can cancel this contract.

It never should have been approved by either govt.
756 2018-10-24 22:18:35 JARED GOLDEN IS A RADICAL LIBERAL WHO WILL TAKE HOME HEATING OIL OFF THE MARKET LET YOUR GRANNY FREEZE TO DEATH AND MAKE YOU DRIVE A TESLA! @RepPoliquin's desperation is palpable.
757 2018-10-24 22:18:33 I guess we're pumping 3% less oil today.
758 2018-10-24 22:18:30 Big oil is too greedy. Would never do it.

762 2018-10-24 22:18:17 great start lawrence i believe that an initial frying at around 350 degrees until the strings become flexible and then removed and drained and then another dip in 375 oil to crisp them up will improve the color i think this will work lawrence
763 2018-10-24 22:17:59 Peanut oil isn’t a problem if that’s what you’re thinking.. my roommate has a deadly peanut allergy
764 2018-10-24 22:17:53 Afaik they are deep fried from raw in what I've told is a vortex of oil. It's kind of like a poached egg, but it's deep fried so it's better. 
765 2018-10-24 22:17:45 The next four years should see better growth than the last four (whoever wins) - as oil can’t fall as much in dollars as it did in 2014/15. To avoid “toast” (ie debt problems), any government has to boost its revenues.

770 2018-10-24 22:17:27 The whole premise for vaping is stupid. You’re inhaling a superheated oil that’s full of dyes, perfumes, nicotine and flavorings and exhaling water vapor. If it’s only water where the hell is everything else?!! It’s in your Lungs. The only advantage I can see is it doesn’t smell.
771 2018-10-24 22:17:07 @PnPCBC oil is the card Saudi Arabia holds in hushing retaliatory measures. Winter is ahead of us. You don't bite the hand that feeds you.

775 2018-10-24 22:16:50 Yes, vegan cheese is nasty -  there's one made from coconut oil which smells of Wotsits when you melt it which I don't think is so bad. But I've been banned from having it by family vote.

787 2018-10-24 22:15:29 How about not using palm oil at all? It's just a cheaper filler used to maximise profits, you don't need it.
788 2018-10-24 22:15:23 @realDonaldTrump hey, dum dum, moving the citizenship of the US to electric vehicles would provide more gas for the military, reducing our dependency on foreign oil, from places like Saudi Arabia. Tremendous! So sad, so dumb. #dummy

We need billions in research to get there and there is no way without fossil. We can export $100s billion a day with a pipeline. Itll take decades to get there without

840 2018-10-24 22:08:28 I used to grow canola and I still thought margarine sucks… Canola oil can be used as fuel so that works better for me than to eat it. 
841 2018-10-24 22:08:17 Will try without the heat just yet as the oil as it is is lovely! Glad they went due well x
842 2018-10-24 22:08:16 Maybe try a lavender oil? That helps soothe and relax me...I put some on my pillow and forehead at night
843 2018-10-24 22:08:13 Oil
844 2018-10-24 22:07:47 Here's a life hack I just learned: if u add a little sesame oil to your instant ramen, it makes it taste so much better
845 2018-10-24 22:07:47 But then they’re crying when their engine blows. I have a friend that’s like “yeah my last oil change was 20k miles ago.” Girl is about to have a car payment for the next 4 years and no working car to show for it.
846 2018-10-24 22:07:22 We have now entered the final chapter for big oil.

847 2018-10-24 22:07:14 I’m just tryna figure out how much ass I gotta throw back or how much  I gotta suck because he buying me everything BUT this damn phone! Jewelry, tires for my car, oil changes, pedicures, etc.
848 2018-10-24 22:07:00 You gotta really REALLY be in love to wash a nigga feet with oil.
849 2018-10-24 22:06:59 My mum has been taking efo riro to work everyday this week, warms it in the microwave in the staff room until the whole place smells of oil
850 2018-10-24 22:06:57 First of my own reading implied he meant oil price never got that high of abt 100$... and 2ndly it never dropped below $90 in 2012... Oil price just started going up since middle of last year... If we r wise we won't make the same mistake of sharing the money amongst senate
851 2018-10-24 22:06:53 I was just enjoying an oil of Olay infused ladies’ razor this morning and feeling kinda guilty
852 2018-10-24 22:06:46 And when I died my hair and wanted it to grow back I got pumpkin seed oil capsules from a health food store. I would open them up and massage into my scalp. It makes your hair grow so fast!
853 2018-10-24 22:06:45 BRI is NOT ONLY a debt trap, its ultimate goal is to help the CCP take control of the important ports, rail roads, oil supply lines, and strategic mines around the world, to prepare for the US-Sino war in the future.
854 2018-10-24 22:06:41 Couldn't agree more - short term solution to address the short term problem of crypto price fluctuation. Also, I'd like to see a stable coin pegged to a basket of commodities - oil included maybe? Recall Vinay Gupta on @bchaininsider discuss this at some point
855 2018-10-24 22:06:30 So I just tested oil painting and I think I might have found my calling
856 2018-10-24 22:06:28 As I see it, socialism and freedom are like oil and water. Democrats have abandoned the Bill of Rights in favor of socialism. We have almost nothing in common with them. One must either love freedom or be a Democrat, you can't do both, IMHO.
857 2018-10-24 22:06:24 Think the same thing happening with Oil reserves off the north of Scotland. So much natural gas and rich fishing waters being exploited to extinction
858 2018-10-24 22:06:22 Coconut Oil, Honey and Sugar
-Put some coconut oil into a bowl and add honey. Add sugar until it’s grainy and not watery. This helps with dry skin also. Apply this with a cotton bud.
859 2018-10-24 22:06:13 Hi there. For low porosity hair we recommend our Baobab & Tea Tree Oil collection.
860 2018-10-24 22:06:10 @CBS4Shaun Wow, your report on Prop 112 was REALLY biased. Why don't you leave the comfort of your studio and come to Northern Colorado to see the damage oil and gas has done up here. There is a reason people support 112. Maybe you should investigate that & tell the whole story.
861 2018-10-24 22:06:06 @VP hand off from Venezuela!! You just want oil  we will figth!!
862 2018-10-24 22:06:04 Possibly even more hypocritical is their expansion of Arctic oil drilling whilst they simultaneously heavily promote REDD projects around the world which will potentially diminish the livelihoods of millions of forest dwellers with some of the lowest carbon emissions on Earth.
863 2018-10-24 22:06:04 Haha idk what you're talking about but the " patchouli oil" situation sounds more a commentary on stoner culture than cultural appropriation. And as to me not knowing because of where I live, I used to live in bumfuck Arkansas, where confederate flags are more common than roads
864 2018-10-24 22:05:57 New Lucky Charms With The Oil In Committed Relationship Barely Ever Arch Necks Into Showing Up For 'The
865 2018-10-24 22:05:50 I disagree with some people and their ideology, but I happen to care more about my country's subsidies in the oil industry and the cuts to education my local government has made, or the literal hate crimes against immigrants happening in my neighborhood.
866 2018-10-24 22:05:40 Having a car is nice and stuff until I have to put gas, get an oil change, new tires and all that good stuff
867 2018-10-24 22:05:36 but all this essential oil i’ve been pouring on the holes in my socks helps right
868 2018-10-24 22:05:33 Avocado, egg, and a little olive oil seriously make my hair sooooo shiny (without looking greasy). I leave it in for 30 mins or sleep with it in over night. It strengthens your hair so much.

He tells such whoppers with all this sincerity and knows it is false!  #Barqah and #Fezzan receive a dribble and corrupt #Tripoli grabs all the rest!
871 2018-10-24 22:05:08 What a disingenuous pile of drivel. Being concerned about climate change and not wanting to be ripped off by the oil companies aren't mutually exclusive. Maybe you should check with National what their position is on climate change, since they've 'promised' to repeal the tax.
872 2018-10-24 22:04:58 Olive Oil, Honey and Sugar 
-Put some sugar into a bowl and add 1tbsp of olive oil and 1tbsp of honey and mix until it’s pasty. This helps with dry skin
873 2018-10-24 22:04:57 I can handle post cheetoo fingers and long toes with oil

880 2018-10-24 22:03:34 We do have the BART tunnel under the Bay; it survived the Loma Prieta earthquake, unlike some bridges and overpasses. Europe is also not owned by the oil companies.

945 2018-10-24 21:56:52 So you oppose other initiatives to get Alberta’s oil to market simply because it is someone else’s idea?
946 2018-10-24 21:56:52 selective pressures. 
This validates evolutionary theory, both its accuracy, and its predictive power.
The only time I'm aware of wherein Creationism was tested was an oil company that tried to use the Bible to predict oil field locations, and failed.

948 2018-10-24 21:56:38 So, are we importing or exporting oil? I can answer: we are now self-sufficient in fossil fuels, ought to stockpile for our future, never export it [raises our own prices], and pipelines are dirty, dangerous and poorly located.
949 2018-10-24 21:56:37 I abhor the stench of oil, invest in wind and solar, reduce the carbons.

977 2018-10-24 21:53:28 Not sure any of those named were particularly useful in the oil and arms deal trade negotiation field.

Didn't some of them go to prison too?
978 2018-10-24 21:53:22 If I did that I'd have a random line sprawled across the page.

Kinda like when an oil painter goes "Lets make some birds" *dab dab dab* Oh look birds!

Me: *dab dab dab* Oh look! Dab dab dab!
979 2018-10-24 21:53:18 Lol it’s facts. You give them a hug and you’ll smell like coconut oil and shea butter for the rest of the day... we like it though.
980 2018-10-24 21:53:17 Anyone here seen Occupied? Norwegian show on Netflix...the Russians come to “help w the oil supply” in Norway and then stay all winter. Their (fictional) language “nuts on all sides” is eerily familiar. A little to close to home.

992 2018-10-24 21:51:39 Went to the store today because I needed olive oil and I ended up leaving with the most random assortment of items.
993 2018-10-24 21:51:28 abt my last rt,,,,, um one time my car kept signalling my car was low oil but i thought the symbol meant my turns were so wide that the gasoline would spill out (i....yea) but long story short i kept driving my car for days when it potentially was gna explode at any moment<3
994 2018-10-24 21:51:23 Trust me to burn myself on boiling oil
995 2018-10-24 21:51:19 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
996 2018-10-24 21:51:13 Seems reasonable. Can you point me to a source for this info. Many people arguing against the pipeline say we won't get anymore for our heavy oil by shipping from BC
997 2018-10-24 21:50:46 Tons of hydrocarbon chemical products, synthetic resins, plasticizers, ALL byproducts of oil..LOL . ALL.  Without oil, Adam is paddling like a duck on a wooden rowboat. (even those do not exist, and are all hydrocarbon based in some form).
998 2018-10-24 21:50:45 Isn't one alternative to commit to getting off oil as fast as possible by development and implementation of tech that doesn't rely on oil?

1002 2018-10-24 21:50:22 At night, yes. You can also mix a few drops of this oil into your moisturizer if you like the one you already have. The others I recommended are for AM use.

1008 2018-10-24 21:49:42 The euro and the pound both seem to have depreciated today, and the price of oil also fell.
1009 2018-10-24 21:49:42 There are both natural and human sources of carbon dioxide emissions. Natural sources include decomposition, ocean release and respiration. Human sources come from activities like cement production, deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. FFS
1010 2018-10-24 21:49:38 It is you who "lack English class" sir. Someone said there was never a time that crude oil sold for $120 and you brought out table to prove him wrong. Your table still didn't carry $120 which makes @otugo007 correct and you start insulting someone who pointed it out. Tueh
1011 2018-10-24 21:49:36 Installed to demolish most of Gough's work. No wonder he ran around the country pouring oil on troubled waters post dismissal. Thought to self at time "funny!" The discomfort felt was an alarm going off over what RJH was doing to us. Traded on union loyalty too. #wewasdone

1016 2018-10-24 21:48:57 Treat yourself to an oil change.
1017 2018-10-24 21:48:56 The foolish virgins did not have oil {Holy Spirit_) therefore were never saved. This is not the way to study Scripture, to throw a few verses out and hope they stick.

1020 2018-10-24 21:48:35 I rub coconut oil on my butt before anything comes on. I noticed it helps a lot. Minimal chafing.
1021 2018-10-24 21:48:27 Not good. Canadians are credit maxxed now. Besides that: throw in ridiculously stringent mortgage requirements, heavy investment in U,S. equities, sagging housing market & oil sands landlocked. Let's hope the pot industry doesn't tank -- well, on second thought.
1022 2018-10-24 21:48:25 It's about big oil, big money & big gun & the most important reason is it's the American ally & partner in crime un the ME. In another word, it's not even a crime to Trump & its ppl but a savior to humanity resulting in wars after wars millions death & millions displacement in ME
1023 2018-10-24 21:48:05 But a little chemical etching liquid or even industrial paint solvent would distort the microlevel of imprint skin oil would produce. So the technology is only valuable until the crooks setup their cover up.

1027 2018-10-24 21:47:26 And if you win, will you investigate and hopefully sue Exxon, Shell, and the other Big Oil companies that misled the public?
1028 2018-10-24 21:47:24 What are you talking about? There is no justice in SA, you will a get a more honest verdict from the Talibans than from your kingdom. I doubt there is even a state in SA, but a bunch of princes and princesses enjoying their cut of the oil revenues cake.
1029 2018-10-24 21:47:22 Your face is producing too much oil and that’s why you’re greasy. You keep using all these mattifyers and toners and powders and it’s freaking out- kinda like if you wash your hair everyday, your hair freaks out. Adding oil helps reconfigure itself, kinda

You talk about ending Saudi oil imports. Why don't we use Hibernia? The last tanker load went to Croatia. Get Itving Oil on and find out what is going on.

1040 2018-10-24 21:45:59 I believe the cardinal reasons why Buhari came on board is correct the abnormalities. Then why is he committing same or worst.
Today (FEC) has approved a budget of N8.73tn for 2019 fiscal year.
The price of oil is pegged at $60 per barrel, Exchange rate at #N305 to $1.

1047 2018-10-24 21:45:13 Do you have any idea what all comes from oil? You will never get rid of oil. I suggest you look it up and find out everything that oil produces that you and I use everyday, then get all fired up about it.

1058 2018-10-24 21:44:33 @SagarRV1 Suggesting that you make a video on what to look at each sector when analysing a company. Like banks look at NIMS, ROA. For say chemical comapny, maybe crude oil etc I know you can paint all company in a sector same but U get my point
1059 2018-10-24 21:43:56 I remember a year or so ago David did a super flip from short to long oil for big picture outlook when many were range trading looking for oml last $2 down That too was another outstanding (and prophetic) call in hindsight.
1060 2018-10-24 21:43:51 Really, just, step away from the Truffle Oil!
1061 2018-10-24 21:43:43 Good is good. THAT'S how to deal with shorts, not by calling bosses... or by launching big oil conspiracy theories...

1062 2018-10-24 21:43:39 Now we are a little overcrowded island with few natural resources, little oil left + virtually no coal, a very reduced industrial sector and an economy kept afloat by the City and housing.

1065 2018-10-24 21:43:26 I suspect you’re a virgin, shite at fitba, not the sharpest tool in the box and nae oil painting. All the best 
1066 2018-10-24 21:43:22 And yes I think there is fundamental difference between a reckless disregard for the lives of civilians and soldiers in pursuit of oil supplies and kissing Bush’s arse and the systematic murder of millions as an end goal in itself.
1067 2018-10-24 21:42:52 Hi Jason, for auction purchases, there is no tax receipt given because an item is received in return. Please email oilersfoundation@edmontonoilers.com if you have any further questions. Thanks!
1068 2018-10-24 21:42:50 so you want to see oil companies get hurt, doesn't matter for what?
1069 2018-10-24 21:42:48 It's absolute perfection isn't it.
The Oil on Canvas live version is also wonderful.
1070 2018-10-24 21:42:40 Brilliant! That will save me buying lemon oil for the next time I restring my guitar  which will be soon :)
1071 2018-10-24 21:42:30 No, but it might affect how such companies treat their Russian subsidiaries, or their staff visiting Russia. Oil companies are part of geopolitics. I think to them it does matter where such attacks came from.

1094 2018-10-24 21:40:20 But we both know I’ve had a rough last couple of weeks and I’ve only gotten one zit since then. I actually commented about it a few weeks ago to Aaryk that my new face oil is the bomb cause it keeps even my stress acne in check
1095 2018-10-24 21:40:16 Utter nonsense, you’ve obviously the culinary knowledge of a cod liver oil tablet! The curry forms part of the combined flavors of the ingredients that’s why they compliment each other - by your rationale why put mint on lamb, apple on pork, horseradish on beef etc etc etc.....
1096 2018-10-24 21:40:11 But I DID go to the doctor/get a prescription for my sinus infection AND get my oil change today though so cheers to me for that.
1097 2018-10-24 21:40:10 Still not hearing anyone talking aboutdoing something that would actually hurt the Saudis. Ban the import of their oil.

1100 2018-10-24 21:39:51 Having said that, I would have to say a massive glut of oil likely had far more to do with it, than the Olympics

I would think being the main economic engine in Canada for over a decade tends to bring people to your province


1101 2018-10-24 21:39:46 And no, lacquer isn't a good idea over oil paint. They'll cross-pollinate. I'm not totally sure about polyurethane though.

1104 2018-10-24 21:39:09 @ScottAdamsSays RE: Venezuela funding the march. Your confusion might be that the POPULATION is the one that doesn't have money, but the GOVERNMENT is very well funded with the little oil production left and drug money

1106 2018-10-24 21:39:04 Yes. It will smell different on everyone when it blends with your body oil
1107 2018-10-24 21:38:59 Yes, I'm sure for Californians, that bailing out the same hurricane victims along the Florida and Louisiana coasts year after year never gets old - or giving subsidies to big oil.
1108 2018-10-24 21:38:55 Better kutenga cooking oil 
1109 2018-10-24 21:38:51 Ask the bbc, savile, king, gad, and others.
The government arnt prioritising eradicating paedophiles. They have been known to protect them. Priority is oil ad arms deals.
1110 2018-10-24 21:38:46 For instance the Bush’s were in bed with the Saudi’s and multinational oil corporations as well as multiple intelligence agencies. Now notice Obama didn’t alter any of those Bush era trade deals neither did Trump I wonder why 
1111 2018-10-24 21:38:30 I had a bowl for lunch and aside from needing olive oil while baking to keep the ravs more moist it was delicious! We'll see how the S.O. feels about it. He's less of a veggie lover than I so it's always a risk making a no meat meal. Carrots would have been a good addition.

1113 2018-10-24 21:38:06 See if some daftie whips out the old “brings into the economy” nonsense about pre-meditated murder of people or animals again please remind them that moral obligations are not transferable for cash. They are oil and water, always.
1114 2018-10-24 21:38:04 Heckling is absolutely the right response to jerks who create policies in which they ignore real threats to future generations so they can make oil money, children are separated from their mothers, people's passports are taken for no reason. SHAME is the right response.

1116 2018-10-24 21:37:52 We don’t need their oil or land for our bases, and we sure as hell don’t need to sell our arms to a country that supports terrorism. Screw them! There are other countries in the area with much better humanities records that we can build our military base on. Saudi Arabia
1117 2018-10-24 21:37:51 How much of that growth is related to oil and gas?
1118 2018-10-24 21:37:39 Mind you, in most cases attribution doesn't add anything and only plays in the attacking country's hands.
But I think there's a good reason for the oil industry to learn Russia appears to have been behind Trisis.

1120 2018-10-24 21:37:26 when oil runs out they can go back to eating lizards
1121 2018-10-24 21:37:20 Don, You failed to mention that you're getting a lot of help from Paul Ryan's Super PAC.  Those ads are deceptive & are being funded by out of state special interest groups like the oil and insurance industries.  #NE02
1122 2018-10-24 21:37:20 That dictatorship should tax oil
1123 2018-10-24 21:37:19 So we finally convinced my grandma to use cbd oil for her arthritis and now my grandad is trying to make up some kind of ailment in order for us to buy for him as well cidjjdjs
1124 2018-10-24 21:37:11 I just have to put this out into the universe: there is #NOCURE for Crohn's! Anyone telling you otherwise is a modern snake oil peddler. The word "cure" dishonors CD warriors who have lost their battle with this horrible disease, some I even called friends.  #IBD #Science
1125 2018-10-24 21:37:11 Who’s harvesting trees, which are a renewable resource, most are made from recycling...
I’m assuming you live somewhere not made with any wood products or oil products?
1126 2018-10-24 21:37:05 The day I gotta drive like 150 miles my check oil light comes on 
1127 2018-10-24 21:36:58 Acrylics and oils don't mix together. I typically do oil base then weather with acrylics since they're easiest to remove if you put too much on and need to do some heavy cleaning.
1128 2018-10-24 21:36:56 Absolutely!  Those calls would have been loud and proud the moment the oil price dropped below $100 a Barrel.

1133 2018-10-24 21:35:59 The whole world knows what happened, but oil speaks louder than amnesty.
1134 2018-10-24 21:35:56 Federal Executive Council has approved a budget of N8.73tn for 2019 fiscal year. The price of oil is pegged at $60 per barrel, exchange rate at N305 to $1 and daily crude oil production at 2.3m barrels per day. 

Presentation to @nassnigeria soon.
1135 2018-10-24 21:35:49 Feinstein is delusional. Polution from California, ships and oil spills caused the conditions. No heatwave exists in the ocean! Earth's Climate has always been in cycles since ita beginning.
1136 2018-10-24 21:35:37 Moral of the story: Hustle till a “bread and oil sandwich” seems nice
1137 2018-10-24 21:35:33 Less than 18% of crude oil is used for fuel. Well over 6000 everyday items need oil in their manufacturing process.

1142 2018-10-24 21:35:05 1/ The Brits wanted oil for their navy. Before anyone knew how big a deal the oil business was to be. They manoevred the Persian/Iranian government to get it. The USA after WW2 fell into line with the Brits. The Shah was a put up job.
1143 2018-10-24 21:34:43 @CTVPowerPlay we are selling vehicles, not arms. I also guarantee that if the Yemenis asked Iran for RPG's to defeat them they would get them. This is a non-issue. Saudis have been killing dissenters for years. Still selling us oil.
1144 2018-10-24 21:34:31 You spilled some oil on the floor, in the room, didn’t you?

1148 2018-10-24 21:33:41 Sometimes you need that natural oil to get in those tight crevices.
1149 2018-10-24 21:33:27 Saudi Arabia also agreed to supply $3 billion oil to Pakistan on deferred payments. This facility will continue for the second and third year also. The deferred amount thus stands at dollar 12 billion.
1150 2018-10-24 21:33:24 if u use an oil paint for a weathering wash over your gunpla what do u use for the top coat? you cant use acrylic anymore right so does lacquer top coat work?
1151 2018-10-24 21:33:22 How about the depths of the oil price on which deficit ridden dependency Scotland was supposed to thrive? How many hospitals would close to get Scotland under a 3 per cent deficit per the EU?

It's like big tobacco. Hope there's a big AG lawsuit. Most coastal states should be involved. 

I'd love to see a consortium of insurance companies sue big oil for all their storm coverage

You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;  you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.

1156 2018-10-24 21:32:33 Worse, it actually is an ELE. Their seventies research showed sea level rise. In response, they raised their oil platforms.
1157 2018-10-24 21:32:22 Lol somewhat.. When the shit come up on the dash to check my tire pressure and the date they put on the windshield that tells me to come back for an oil Change .
1158 2018-10-24 21:32:15 The system is a scam. A classic horizontal integrated monopoly in which the P5 is the Standard Oil of today.
1159 2018-10-24 21:32:13 I do not understand niggas at oil. like wtf
1160 2018-10-24 21:31:59 They make these coupons specifically for me. I once bought four bottles of oil at autozone because they said it was a good deal and I didn’t realize till after that it was only a good deal if you were trying to by four bottles of oil.
1161 2018-10-24 21:31:43 So long as it looks like the Lucas Oil Stadium which would complement the brick structures in the area.
1162 2018-10-24 21:31:37 Americans may support impeachment but Congress will never let that happen. Trump is too useful to them. While he takes up the media oxygen they are busy dismantling everything good PBO did. Goodbye, clean air, water, food. Hello fracking, oil spills, pesticides,lead, asbestos etc
1163 2018-10-24 21:31:28 @realDonaldTrump I do not want to fight with you, it's hard for me, but the full boycott of oil is more important to us than anything else. Like, or not, full oil embargo until November 4th is the key to your victory, and also the key to our victory.
1164 2018-10-24 21:31:25 Still to come on "Bulls & Bears": New York's attorney general suing Exxon Mobil...accusing the oil and gas giant of defrauding it's investors by downplaying climate change...our panel reacts...next!

1172 2018-10-24 21:30:24 Yep, make sure to oil it up and then wrap it up
1173 2018-10-24 21:30:22 Maybe if the oil lobby and everyone that hates space exploration team up we can

1178 2018-10-24 21:30:06 Of course I wanted to trade the, bread and oil “sandwich,” for a hot slice of pizza, chocolate milk and some tater tots. He wanted what I had and I wanted his but for some reason “I just said no”
1179 2018-10-24 21:29:46 You mean to say that the information in 2014 about the oil running out was a lie, well I never!
1180 2018-10-24 21:29:39 You had very high price targets for eca and erf so guessing you would have had to have high targets for XLE if expected those high targets for erf and eca that you had posted. Plus if oil goes to 90+ like you projected one would expect xle to go much higher.
1181 2018-10-24 21:29:28 I either get my oil changed as soon as my miles hit the number indicated for a change, or I wind up driving wayyyy past the recommended oil change point. There’s no middle.
1182 2018-10-24 21:29:15 Getting an oil change without anyone telling me to is probably the most grown up thing I’ve ever done.
1183 2018-10-24 21:29:03 I purchased this book too, i would recommend it to anyone that is interested in knowing about this great oil, and what it can do to save people!
1184 2018-10-24 21:29:02 They ARE I love them   
Oh also! Primavera can be made without cream or cheese; perfectly valid variation to do it with a simple olive oil and garlic, too.
1185 2018-10-24 21:28:53 They are now developing electric cars that will not user gasoline, what will happen to the oil & gas industry?
1186 2018-10-24 21:28:51 So they can start supplanting the treasury tax income from oil pretty soon then?  Tesla just had to ride out the Trump administration, for now.

1195 2018-10-24 21:27:48 Now everyone in the world has realized that the regime of #Saudi is a criminal regime, however, the US considers this regime as his best ally and has supported this criminal regime for many years and this supporting will be continued as long as Saudi's oil runs out.
1196 2018-10-24 21:27:45 Sure raise oil prices! People love Tesla's, solar, and the new Tesla power wall for you're home is simply amazing.  Let's put the @SaudiEmbassyUSA back on their camels!

1201 2018-10-24 21:27:19 Peter Casey is a racist against Travellers & a bigot against welfare recipients. If he’s offended by being called a racist, then he shouldn’t say racist stuff! Otherwise he should shut up& take his oil! Or drop out of the race. I’m looking forward to his humiliation at the polls.

1210 2018-10-24 21:25:56 @CAoliveranch Hi There, I use your olive oil every day in all of my recipes.  I am a California girl originally but now live in Vermont.  So happy to have a delicious and authentic olive oil that actually tastes like olives.  Thank you so much for your product and for all you do.
1211 2018-10-24 21:25:55 Oil paint dries out my skin as the pigments slowly give me cancer, I am aging faster than the average hot Gay Guy, also it’s gala season
1212 2018-10-24 21:25:51 Too much oil 
1213 2018-10-24 21:25:40 IMO wiz > Nigerian crude oil
1214 2018-10-24 21:25:33 The bigger issue KSA has is the oil price. #Saudi needs $106 a barrel to pay for the social services etc.  As it is in the high $60’s the place will go broke. Couple this with Dow drop we see these headlines “After Khashoggi, Saudi Arabia’s economic future is uncertain”
1215 2018-10-24 21:25:30 The best part is that it was all Vito brought to the table and he still got trounced. If peeps a bigger amount of Hamilton is against LRT, I feel like more would have been easily drawn to his single issue, snake oil campaign.

Strange how it all played out though lol.
1216 2018-10-24 21:25:28 Hi @drmonavand! We’ve got two bottles of CBD Hemp Oil for you at the Organic Spa event tonight!  Swing by the Barlean’s table for full size bottles of our USDA Organic AND Extra Strength CBD Hemp Oil at the Viceroy  L’Ermitage Beverly Hills. Just ask for Ola!
1217 2018-10-24 21:25:27 Guess 4% GDP lowest unemployment largest oil producer in world. Oh I get it. You don't work get hand outs.. sad you not want to be wealthy
1218 2018-10-24 21:25:21 This minister is totally disconnected from reality. Disconnected from anyone who lives in a rural setting or lives in the area of the country that provides for the rest of the country. Oil, Gas, Foresty and Agriculture are the back to this countries success.
1219 2018-10-24 21:25:08 oil should be changed every 3000 miles, also get ready for your battery to die randomly if you’ve had it for 4.5+ years, coolant should be flushed and filled every 50k miles, also if you’ve got a new car then transmission fluid should be changed according to the manual.
1220 2018-10-24 21:24:59 And I wonder if it were remind anybody of Martin Luther King. Somebody tell the Caravan to wait until his birthday. How long before the starvation sets in. Drill water wells not oil wells. Make the Seabees proud. Buy them a well drilling machine. Make water flow they will love US
1221 2018-10-24 21:24:48 Be careful with maintenance, very picky about oil and always keep an eye on the level

1223 2018-10-24 21:24:24 The person that did my oil change today asked if I’m still in highschool 
1224 2018-10-24 21:24:24 I started a painting in oil and I was like no I wanna do it in acrylic and I really just wasted a canvas but I’m glad I did 
1225 2018-10-24 21:24:22 The oil industry has been subsidised by that amount, roughly, every year for years. What more does Alberta want? While bragging about its equalisation contributions, the rest of Canada has been providing about half of that subsidy.
1226 2018-10-24 21:24:18 You try tea tree oil?
1227 2018-10-24 21:24:16 Thanks for that. My BMW needs new wheels next week so I’ll have to wait for my benefits and then my Ford Ranger needs an oil change so that will need to be the week after but cheers for paying your taxes. 
1228 2018-10-24 21:24:15 The Nigerian Vultures are gathering because of 50 oil blocs and marginal fields licences that will expire in 2019.
1229 2018-10-24 21:23:44 In the last case in which New York tried to sue the oil sector one justice threw it out as not being credible as the same people launching the suit still used gas powered vehicles in their fleet of police cars, ambulances etc.
1230 2018-10-24 21:23:36 On-prem is like oil. It has a shelf life.

1232 2018-10-24 21:23:31 Mixing the oil back into the peanut butter really takes me back to the 1800s
1233 2018-10-24 21:23:30 Ministries of Oil, Finance and Communications have new ministers now.
1234 2018-10-24 21:23:29 Honestly I do not like this, it's kind of cruel because the rat or whatever it is..is trying to get rid of the soap or oil or saponate or what it is.

For me, wind turbines are as beautiful as tall ships.
1240 2018-10-24 21:22:21 They don't need 'silk route' anymore. There are big ships and airplanes. 

They do need Suez canal which gives Egypt some leverage.  They need oil which gives Saudi Araby and Iran some leverage.
1241 2018-10-24 21:22:13 soooo why oil changes take so long
1242 2018-10-24 21:21:46 And besides your standard oil change for a 36 YO car,I bet this honda won't need to be kept in the shop for any out of nowhere car issues that pop up...Engine still purring Because of the simple delivery..lol
1243 2018-10-24 21:21:42 Red Urchin are what’s bringing in tourists. Climate changes, we as humans have to deal with it. We will but no one is going to stop driving, digging oil wells or showering every day (exclude most of your state, hippies don’t shower we know).
1244 2018-10-24 21:21:41 There’s an Italian dish that’s chopped chicory and anchovies and olive oil or something like that
1245 2018-10-24 21:21:31 Ouu i see. Yeah I feel like the doctors won't really do much but i'd rather get some sort of prognosis instead of thinking something worse. So far today I didn't use any products except jojoba oil & shea butter and it's tamed pretty well lol

1248 2018-10-24 21:21:05 
1249 2018-10-24 21:20:51 Mom: Hey I'm running late would you make a toast for dinner?

Me: Yeah sure! *joy beats back the anxiety for two seconds* seasons meat peels potatoes mixed soup up for seasoning adds paprika/olive oil.

Mom: hey dad says you're making a pork roast?

Me: Yeah? It was right there -
1250 2018-10-24 21:20:41 Beautiful?  This horiziom landscape clutter will be there for ages.  At least an oil derrick was gone in 20 years or so.  These eyesores are PERMANENT.
1251 2018-10-24 21:20:37 Need thc oil so I can make laced soups
1252 2018-10-24 21:20:11 Stop putting truffle oil in mac and cheese!
1253 2018-10-24 21:19:49 My brothers got my oil changed. And cleaned my car  I love them
1254 2018-10-24 21:19:42 Meanwhile it,s full-steam ahead for the #Liberals #TransMountain pipeline project. #FossilFuels are archaic and we can not fight #ClimateChange while increasing #Tarsands #Oil  production. #PanelsNotPipleines.

1256 2018-10-24 21:19:39 Although it would be nice if we got rid of oil subsidies.
1257 2018-10-24 21:19:31 그림에 대한 야망 보다는 당장의 내 존못력을 없애고자 하는 욕구 가장 크군...
1258 2018-10-24 21:19:29 At one time I worked in oil and gas, and slope stability in open it coal mines. However, after decades in geology, the northern melting, runaway climate change is obvious, I live according to science. I want kids to be in a livable world.
1259 2018-10-24 21:19:28 According to the IMF, on average globally, the oil market receives ~$5 Trillion in subsidies. Wanna scrap those too? Name me a single substantial subsidy that Tesla actually receives that keeps "Tesla alive".
1260 2018-10-24 21:19:21 @hausfath How do you plan to get 3rd world to stop burning things? The same people that use PCB laden transformer oil to cook with.
1261 2018-10-24 21:19:19 i put coconut oil in myhair and my hands are stILL OILY FUCK
1262 2018-10-24 21:19:11 Again, I'm not a big fan of companies doing attribution, but I can see that in cases where the targets are part of geopolitics already (oil companies, dissidents) attribution can actually be relevant.
1263 2018-10-24 21:19:03 snake oil salesman ( not generally correct ) but Justin will say anything
1264 2018-10-24 21:18:59 I think it has yet to be demonstrated that Canada "leading by example" will have any meaningful impact on the decisions of other countries. There's a abnormally high cost of doing 'the right thing' when you're a major oil producer like Canada.

1270 2018-10-24 21:18:18 went to my last ortho appointment, now getting an oil change for my car, and then later going to the mall  sooo needless to say, it’s been a good afternoon
1271 2018-10-24 21:18:16 뭔가 탄탄한 기본기..
1272 2018-10-24 21:18:14 These packages have some of the classic signs and clues to tip off of a possible dangerous package. Excessive postage, misspelled names, and insufficient packaging. The only thing they missed is oil on the packaging and wires protruding from the packaging.

1276 2018-10-24 21:17:59 I’m finally getting an oil change after 5 months.
1277 2018-10-24 21:17:50 Have you thought about joining @younglivingeo but you're still on the fence?  I am offering a FREE bottle of Christmas Spirit oil ($10.50 value) to anyone that signs up with me by end of the month!!!
1278 2018-10-24 21:17:49 Olive Oil (one of the oldest global fine food commodities) meets the newest global technology innovation (blockchain), providing ever-more rigorous traceability & authentication the supply chain.  Bravo! to @BellucciPremium @CertifiedOrigins @ORCLBlockchain @oracleopenworld
1279 2018-10-24 21:17:49 The one made with palm oil...hard to wash off. Well thank God for Bleach
1280 2018-10-24 21:17:49 You can try peppermint oil diluted with coconut oil rub down her back helps her body cool down  hopes this helps 
1281 2018-10-24 21:17:47 Lol first of all it ain’t ! The longest time that I went without a oil change was this past time. I was always on it when i was in Wichita. Oils, tires & all that. 
1282 2018-10-24 21:17:46 CBD oil brand recommendations please - not vape, just under tongue

500mg is not strong enough for me

I’ve read some reviews about people getting High from certain brands

I don’t need any more excuses for munchies LOL

1285 2018-10-24 21:17:32 Stop talking symptoms and starting naming the disease. Reinstate glass-steagal, end the fed,  end the military industrial complex/Anglo/Saudi oil wars. So we have a country and a world left to use all that freed up money for education, industry, and health care.
1286 2018-10-24 21:17:26 @realDonaldTrump Dont panic looking at the markets. Just ensure fair trade with China, earnings will be back and ensure oil is 100 by EoY with rate hikes so we can dominate the world and be one of the developed Emerging countries.
1287 2018-10-24 21:17:21 i bought this oil thinking its just CBD and used a lot but now i know it's also THC and I wasn't expecting that and now im really fucking high and not having a great time
1288 2018-10-24 21:17:16 They tried to keep him.. but probably better for all. QST save face & money - and Nando is in oil money
1289 2018-10-24 21:17:09 Got oil in my fucking socks... #WorkisFun
1290 2018-10-24 21:16:56 These are my dream lipsticks.  So easy to apply, barely any bleeding, and they last all day as long as you dont have any food with oil. 
Mannequin is beautiful and unicorn blood was my favorite lipstick for ages.
1291 2018-10-24 21:16:34 Scalp it, maybe, but with all the worlds focus on Saudi and their willingness to open up the wells something above our “pay grade” is happening I think. $TSLA is the black swan for a nation built on oil wealth.
1292 2018-10-24 21:16:33 Start by excluding renewable and efficient energy projects from the passive activity loss rules like oil & gas is.
1293 2018-10-24 21:16:27 Why would these companies do this?
Do they not know that socialist's ultimate goal is to take over private companies to exploit their resources to the detriment of the actual company itself. Shareholders be damned!
EXACTLY like Chavez's takeover of the Venezuelan oil companies. ?
1294 2018-10-24 21:16:24 Soo if I agree to this amendment y’all gonna start pumping oil on FL shorelines and you’ll give me the freedom to vape anywhere?  PSA ALL VAPORS DONT BE IGNORANT THIS ELECTION

1298 2018-10-24 21:15:45 Sugar and coconut oil
1299 2018-10-24 21:15:14 More like a Nazi nationalist takeover and using the Russian for voter hacking The Saudis for oil profiteering and hit men??
1300 2018-10-24 21:14:55 Wars would be short lived affairs if we sent Royals, the 1%er and their grown up children to the front lines, and considerably cheaper anaw.

First it was die for your religion, then your unelected monarch, now its die for the elected politician's career & the oil dollar
1301 2018-10-24 21:14:54 Sorry bro I don't know it was u, ya kano
1302 2018-10-24 21:14:43 Oil dey ur head. 
1303 2018-10-24 21:14:36 I believe there's nothing intrinsically wrong with the oil, but the plantations are usually environmentally damaging by destroyed large areas of rainforest and natural habitat. I avoid it for that reason.
1304 2018-10-24 21:14:31 I thought only the Irvings were refining Saudi oil ... plus that pipeline to the east? It died because it was really a way to send bitumen from Alberta to Saint John to then be shipped abroad ... the refineries in Saint John cant process it
1305 2018-10-24 21:14:27 Ok thanks, and I was gonna get me some pineapples today too, I been eating a lot of spicy foods like hot wings,and I been eating Lucas lol,and ima get some castor oil today too, you the second person that told me about that today

1312 2018-10-24 21:13:49 Hey Europe news flash Russia has you targeted today. Shave a good day. buy their oil, being taken over by Russia better than muslim take over.
1313 2018-10-24 21:13:40 Seeing the wonders of the whole house while keeping the oil on the spoon 
1314 2018-10-24 21:13:24 @narendramodi congress "eco-system" will DESTROY you. and you deserve it for not destroying them in last 4 years.
1315 2018-10-24 21:13:17 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／
1316 2018-10-24 21:13:06 so I have a flat tire , broken driver side mirror , cracked windshield , i’m out of windshield wiper fluid & i’m 3,000 miles over an oil change. someone take my car from me
1317 2018-10-24 21:13:00 진짜 이제야 새삼 깨달아버림..여태껏 내가 인체 그리면서 무의식중 노력해왔던 목표가 자연스러운 동세였음
1318 2018-10-24 21:12:52 Semis, biotech, & certain energy names (despite higher oil) all down approximately 6% today.
1319 2018-10-24 21:12:49 10 industries, despite the current state of the economy and bad oil refund, he’s still paying school fee for student, free health care for pregnant women and child from age 0-5. Employment of youth and building of state of the act ultra Morden stadium in eket, 2 run way. ETC.
1320 2018-10-24 21:12:46 Permanently lowering/eliminating oil imports is strategic. Weakens Russia, US, OPEC. Policy also primes the pump for EV exports. Is this what a modern blitzkrieg looks like?
1321 2018-10-24 21:12:12 진유님은 그림 그릴때 자연스러운 동세에 집착하는 편..
1322 2018-10-24 21:12:09 They didn’t teach me what kind of motor oil to buy in my drivers ed class, so if it turns out that I just massively messed up my car with the wrong oil, I’m suing Trenton Special School District.
1323 2018-10-24 21:12:05 Why would these companies do this?
Do they not know that socialist's ultimate goal is to take over private companies to exploit their resources to the detriment of the actual company itself. Shareholders be damned!

1324 2018-10-24 21:12:03 Utilities, oil, gold, consumer staples, REITS, & bonds all green today.

1326 2018-10-24 21:11:43 Me: *has an empty tank, needs to get tire pressure checked, and needs to get oil changed al at once*
1327 2018-10-24 21:11:04 Lmao. Yeah.... he’s done plenty. But I suppose you support Cruz? That pathetic, sniveling, lying, corrupt, brown nosing twat bought and sold by oil and telecom... Nah, I’m good. We’ll see how it comes out. Good luck on maintain your status quo
1328 2018-10-24 21:11:02 Never touch the stuff, serve you green beans with toasted almonds and lemon, saute in olive oil.
1329 2018-10-24 21:10:58 Cogan:”Trump adm intends to rely on Saudi Arabia to increase its oil production to prevent major price rises when harsh new US sanctions go into effect against Iran on November 5, following Washington’s unilateral renunciation of the 2015 “Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action””
1330 2018-10-24 21:10:51 Also, space cap less than 2%.  IR sanctions looming large.  Oil on water insanely low.  Fun little fact, 400k+ of IR oil going to bonded storage in China, not actual exports.  And so much more if you’re willing to do your homework.
1331 2018-10-24 21:10:47 Natural immunity is better than an artificial one. I will write back later today when I have more time.
The vaccine industry is corrupted & most vaccines are fast- tracked. 
Not checked for genetical/fertility problems. Peanut oil is also present in some vaccines. I lost trust !

1335 2018-10-24 21:10:17 Think about speculation... oil prices... and so on...
1336 2018-10-24 21:10:12 @narendramodi is such a COWARD. he did not destroy his political opponents and their "eco-system".

now he will PAY for it in 2019.
1337 2018-10-24 21:10:06 crazy how oil teams with little history are trash in european football. cough* man city
1338 2018-10-24 21:10:06 recipe:

3 1/4 c AP flour + 1 tsp kosher salt, put in the food processor, mix it for a sec

run food processor, pour liquid in
1339 2018-10-24 21:10:05 These Dominican women in the salon always act like they don’t know what being natural is like. Like me using products with coconut oil in them is a sin.
1340 2018-10-24 21:10:04 It is unfortunate but most likely nothing is going to happen to Saudi Arabia. After all, we heavily rely on them for their oil supply.
1341 2018-10-24 21:10:04 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
1342 2018-10-24 21:09:34 Oh okay go walking until you feel your stomach cramping, eat pineapples, spicy food, drink castor oil and orange juice that’s what I did and I started having contractions
1343 2018-10-24 21:09:32 Use bio oil now
1344 2018-10-24 21:09:27 isn’t it like chilli oil
1345 2018-10-24 21:09:17 economy of these countries very much dependent on oil nations vast wealth, deaths of men women children, very much  align with Madalin Albitch statement as US secretary

1347 2018-10-24 21:09:10 Anybody surprised, people i Venezuela are desperate/suicidal? The terrible fate of V. is to have t largest oil-reserves i/t world: t population is poor, Maduro = crazy & competent, & nowadays it’s not so easy f foreign powers to stage a Coup, even though they are greedy f/t oil.

1356 2018-10-24 21:08:08 "If America had a national food, it would be fry oil."
1357 2018-10-24 21:08:03 Oil dey your head
1358 2018-10-24 21:07:43 We are soon to be a post-oil society.   Meaning, our use of petroleum will be reduced by more than 50%.  I’m hoping the oil companies are diversifying and preparing.
1359 2018-10-24 21:07:43 I'm broke because of the oil and gas industry and the grace of God and you will be able to get to that of the class and say ir a few days ago    
1360 2018-10-24 21:07:30 They work in oil,energy sector, grocery sectors, customer service, medical sector because they can speak Spanish, the technology  sector, manufacturing sector, and that's what employers want. I know I live in Houston TX,  no jobs for Americans,but for illegals they get it.
1361 2018-10-24 21:07:24 What’s your position on pipelines? Will you allow them to be built to stop the import of foreign oil into Canada?
1362 2018-10-24 21:07:23 I wish oil diffusers weren’t so expensive. The good ones, at least.
1363 2018-10-24 21:07:09 I need to oil and replace my tools quite frequently...
1364 2018-10-24 21:07:06 I’m ready to fill my lungs & chill... I need to shampoo & deep condition & give myself a hot oil treatment it’s about that time
1365 2018-10-24 21:07:01 5k to switch the oil, 3k if you burn that son of a bitch up like I do. Everything else, do what your car manual says. Every car is different and require different maintenance.
1366 2018-10-24 21:07:00 Poppers are my favorite essential oil
1367 2018-10-24 21:06:50 I feel ya. Cbd oil has honestly helped me soo much.
1368 2018-10-24 21:06:48 Will get beard oil for you OK
1369 2018-10-24 21:06:47 I’ll have to try oil! I do have gloves for lotion; I’ve been using a Burt’s Bees lotion (that I think came with the gloves?) because I’ve been out of Bag Balm, which I need to remedy ASAP.

1373 2018-10-24 21:06:36 Looks like a place I once ducked into for a piss and found 4 homeless lads singing doo wop acapella songs round a flaming oil barrel.
1374 2018-10-24 21:06:24 Descongestionante, lots of water, vaporizer con eucalipto o tea tree oil. Nothing from Italy or related because it makes it stronger.
1375 2018-10-24 21:06:20 For an Oil producing state like Ondo to be owing salaries its a big shame.
1376 2018-10-24 21:06:14 I girl in my class said she doesn’t change her oil till her engine light comes on in al her cars  girl! Just go get your oil changed it will save you a hell of a lot more money!
1377 2018-10-24 21:06:11 Send the oil police #noDAPL
1378 2018-10-24 21:06:09 And like there were unrendered rocks (they looked like a green screen) enemy textures weren’t loading in so they looked like smeared oil paintings and it was just rough all around
1379 2018-10-24 21:06:06 I learned about change management with a customer that was using our $company firewalls on oil rigs separating process control network from normal network. 

“Just” rebooting the firewall cost them significant amounts of money coz they shut down the wells when they did.
1380 2018-10-24 21:06:04 So, everybody bombs the shit out of the middle east to get oil, then people have nowhere to go, so we are blaming them to find a better place to live? It’s sarcastic... greed... we don’t need oil and coal anymore it’s the past like a lot of laws that are still in place... move on
1381 2018-10-24 21:06:02 Passion will make everything happens govern it and protect it from people who look to steal your passion... it produces oil and fruit

1386 2018-10-24 21:05:28 Everything needs to be thought about in long term terms. The truth is we don't need oil. We need to run a system, any system that shares and invites wealth. Stability and sense and kindness.
1387 2018-10-24 21:05:23 This is on par with that time I forgot my phone in the salad bowl.
Good thing I noticed before I put oil on my salad, and good thing I know I'm that dumb and when I couldn't find it I looked at the bowl full of salad like "... no it can't be."
And let me tell you, it can.
1388 2018-10-24 21:05:18 Why does @BetoORourke:
-Want to abolish ICE?
-Protect sanctuary cities and illegals in those cities?
-Severly restrict 2a rights?
-Raise taxes on everyone?
-Levy an additional $10 tax on every barrel of oil?
-Lie about his hit AND run DWI?
-Not tell you about his $10m net worth?
1389 2018-10-24 21:05:14 Lets put some fact to it
Av. oil price in 2015 $52.5 going below $40 @ some point, Av. oil price in 2018 $71 hitting highs of $86 in oct. In a fully deregulated market, this is expected. Things need to be in perspective
1390 2018-10-24 21:05:13 tasted tge chilli oil once it was hooooooot
1391 2018-10-24 21:05:06 Castor oil, aloe gel, and coconut or argon oil! The best for hair that doesn’t grow and damaged hair
1392 2018-10-24 21:04:54 Olive oil eco styler gel + a headband that I made from pantyhose (works better than a scarf, IMO).
1393 2018-10-24 21:04:49 aye you gotta be careful but honestly get them done !!! just make sure you remove them with oil/wait for as many as poss to fall out naturally - they’re bomb gal
1394 2018-10-24 21:04:41 Wow today was so productive, I cooked food and filled up my tank and put oil in my car and ignored the towering pile of laundry on the floor while I looked for stray pajamas to wear casually in public for the eighth day in a row; I'm getting pretty good at this adult thing.
1395 2018-10-24 21:04:27 Have you tried cbd oil?
1396 2018-10-24 21:04:22 "Nothing changes" because we the people let it happen. Govt can find billions to bail out banks, subsidize train, oil, gas and film companies, and then say that they can't have a more gradual transition for state pensions. It is  all a matter of political priorities.
1397 2018-10-24 21:04:17 Let me guess, we went into recession because of the fall in oil price?
OK, Why did we go into recession in 1984?
And I can also tell you that oil price was far lower during obj era.
So whatever excuse you have, Buhari is the reason why we went into recession period!
1398 2018-10-24 21:04:16 
Tyaaayyssssss 

Did you see the fried in groundnut oil part?
1399 2018-10-24 21:04:16 I use organic Extra Virgin olive oil. Never reheat it and don't use it at high temperature. Has a much lower smoke point than Aberdeen Angus beef dripping, duck fat and goose fat.
1400 2018-10-24 21:04:06 Yup. What also struck me (and I've only gone a chapter in) was that this was all pre-oil. All the pieces were already in place before we found oil. Everything was built from the foundation up.

1404 2018-10-24 21:03:42 It’s so nice not to have any issue with my car finally! First one of my lights were out, same week I put too much oil in and needed it cleaning, then my car key batteries died, then had an empty tank.

1407 2018-10-24 21:03:29 I wonder what the price will be when we start restricting oil by rail too?
1408 2018-10-24 21:03:25 NFLX comp is this. Many sick of getting smashed w/gas price hikes every summer when they just wanna have fun. Or the chore of filling up, oil changes, car maintenance black box bills, etc. All pain points. Like cable bill. Just want EV w/same range to can charge at home once p/wk
1409 2018-10-24 21:02:55 Some people use olive oil #AssassinsCreedOdyssey
1410 2018-10-24 21:02:54 I buy it at Whole Foods. It’s supposed to be pure, wild oregano oil. You can get it at most health food stores or places like GNC.
1411 2018-10-24 21:02:30 Oil maybe? Search specifically for THC vape liquids?
1412 2018-10-24 21:02:29 Dunno about the info she may have provided them, but China essentially owns Venezuela because of the oil. Both countries are angry with us, so....
1413 2018-10-24 21:02:22 From Indonesia to Brazil to Canada to Madagascar to the Congo to the US, everywhere, everywhere, we need to protect the world's remaining old growth, primary forests. Logging, palm oil plantations, slash and burn, cattle grazing, oil drilling, road building, we're killing forests
1414 2018-10-24 21:02:11 He seems not to know what the hell is going on. The people of South Sudan have a president who is clueless and completely oblivion of the operations of the money laundering racket fleecing the oil proceeds #JKLive
1415 2018-10-24 21:01:49 New York State should ban ALL gas/oil products ...if they were serious they would ban it ALL!
1416 2018-10-24 21:01:43 Congratulations Minister Gadkariji. India needs to increase the use of Sunlight greatly to cut down on our dependence of foreign oil. Electricity with help of Sunlight can help us tremendously in this regard.
1417 2018-10-24 21:01:41 No I’ve never found anything that’s a permanent solution. I’ve seen people talking a lot about inverter tables and CBD oil recently, so I think I’m going to save up and investigate those. I’ll let you know how I get on hahaa.

Alas, that's wishful thinking. So, there has to be a governing authority and the $$ to run it has to come from somewhere

1428 2018-10-24 20:59:56 I recommended a mechanic 600 miles away to a classmate in need of an oil change. If you’re ever in the DC area, Sam at Golden Gears is your man. He’s been my parents mechanic since before I was born. So if you use Sam, tell him you’re a friend of mine. #GoldenGearsRockville
1429 2018-10-24 20:59:54 I also heard CBD oil can help as well. Although I’ve honestly never tried it myself as it’s cannabis based and I avoid that stuff.

1435 2018-10-24 20:59:38 You're missing the point. There's a standard for fueling equipment and the storage/transportation. That is established by.... not the oil companies. It's a uniform standard. And it's not something they pulled out of the sky. Lots of r&d and testing is performed and then....
1436 2018-10-24 20:59:34 But they can ill afford the increase of cost of heating, hydro, gasoline, electricity. They aren’t “inherently” carbon virtuous, as they can’t afford to switch to natural gas from oil eg. Or electric cars. Public transit isn’t around for all.

1532 2018-10-24 20:48:37 Barack Obama(D)2009-2017 said this Campaigning, As with George W Bush(R)2001-2009, As With Bill Clinton (D)1993-2001) George W Bush Mexico: immigration reform in exchange for Oil development.? He also set up More border Gaurds to compassionately turn away Mexicans, Guest Workers
1533 2018-10-24 20:48:37 I need someone to replace the chain on my nunchucks and oil the bearings
1534 2018-10-24 20:48:26 You highlight mismanagement of the Venezuelan economy. Venezuela is broke, oil exports are plunging, Its economic state is a tragedy unfolding.
1535 2018-10-24 20:48:13 Sonepur: Driver of an oil tanker was charred to death when his vehicle caught fire after it collided with a truck y'day on Sambalpur-Sonepur Road. One person who was critically injured, has been admitted to a hospital in Ullunda. The fire was later doused by fire tenders. #Odisha

1538 2018-10-24 20:47:58 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
1539 2018-10-24 20:47:56 Antoni falando Olive Oil é a coisa mais sexy que eu ja vi na vida
1540 2018-10-24 20:47:42 All that is of no consequence if the tax regime fails to deliver revenue to Government. Since the first oil came ashore,  every barrel of Norway's oil has generated 3 times as much as the UK's - that is where the UK Gov has demonstrated utter failure and incompetence.
1541 2018-10-24 20:47:36 $WTI down .2% on the day and $XOP down 6% on the day. Either oil or equity traders were wrong today, can't be both. I don't think the indiscriminate, panic selling on the $SPY and $DIA lends itself to logical decision making. My money is on the $XOP sellers being wrong today.
1542 2018-10-24 20:47:34 I need some motherfuckin cbd oil. My knee feels like it’s gonna pop outta place & a bitch is scared.

1544 2018-10-24 20:47:07 i felt two pimples come in and instead of ferociously popping them i went and bought more tea tree oil. ugh we love a mature woman.
1545 2018-10-24 20:47:02 I have never used beard oil, what is it supposed to do? Like honestly I've read so many mixed thing about it, I rather asks a source I can trust 
1546 2018-10-24 20:47:01 Yeah they better throw all the oil money at Zidane.

1551 2018-10-24 20:46:24 Aliens don’t want to hurt us but the government is gonna convince us they do and incite worldwide panic to avoid advancing technology for the general population because efficient non oil based energy that the aliens have will crush the capitalist industries that need it to thrive
1552 2018-10-24 20:46:19 I literally only get weed from one person, I definitely aint buying oil from anyone else plus I know I’m not going to get the same number for what I get.
1553 2018-10-24 20:46:17 Amid a lack of fundamental developments that could have kept the bearish pressure strong, #crude #oil prices staged a technical recovery during the first half of the day on Wednesday and the barrel of $WTI rose to a daily high of $67.70.
1554 2018-10-24 20:46:09 Maybe ask him. But you might get a better answer if you bring him some oil for his wheel chair. I can here it squeaking from Canada!
1555 2018-10-24 20:45:32 I'll be doing quite a bit of forestry and farming, maybe some oil.

Also, for the next DLC please do what you did with industries for universities. Having a campus would be awesome.

I have an idea I could go into further detail in email
1556 2018-10-24 20:45:31 I keep expecting to see a @WhispersNewsLTD headline “South Dublin School make headscarves compulsory in bid to tackle lice epidemic.” Just done combing. I do it twice a week. Tea tree oil and ravintsara oil are also good repellents.
1557 2018-10-24 20:45:24 Report says £300 billion is cost of extraction. The value of 17bn barrels of  oil, at $80 a barrel is $1.36 trillion.
1558 2018-10-24 20:45:23 The flaming oil drums full of broken up pallets that picketers are using to stay warm are giving the Canada Post strike a pretty Mad Max vibe tbh
1559 2018-10-24 20:45:20 Wash it w oil free shampoo. Brush it. Blow dry. Brush. Flat iron/curl. Brush it again.
1560 2018-10-24 20:45:16 If the world went green and gave up our addiction to oil we solve global warming & the Saudi killing machine disappears. Simple really.
1561 2018-10-24 20:45:13 just tried oil. lol.
1562 2018-10-24 20:45:08 Free oil Change! And tune Up tomorrow! Gotta take care of my baby!
1563 2018-10-24 20:45:05 Real Caesar dressing? Anchovies and all?  Cause I totally would start toasting the Italian crusty bread, drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with cracked pepper.
1564 2018-10-24 20:44:56 “Rebates” are coming next year either lol. We can’t be this gullible. He’s trying to buy us off with our own money. Secondly, if he cared about the environment he’d stop Saudi oil and their tankers, maybe park his own plane a bit more, maybe tax goods on the heavy polluters?
1565 2018-10-24 20:44:42 Make sure y’all hit up @awwhalenawl over at the Que tent this weekend if y’all want some oil.
1566 2018-10-24 20:44:28 Np...When I wash my hair every other week I try to use a hair mask, or at least deep condition. Anything with olive oil is great for natural moisture. You use it AFTER shampoo before conditioner (if you want to know why I can explain) I also only try to straighten my hair once
1567 2018-10-24 20:44:18 Every time says we should be less civil, dems mail Bo*bs to people they don’t like. The evidence for this is everywhere. There is so much evidence & proof that dems are behind this, they have audio, video, texts, EMAILS, caricature portraits, I think even an oil painting

1573 2018-10-24 20:43:02 Heard at the @ASUG365 Executive Exchange: Data may be the new oil, but most companies are just building up bigger and bigger reserves.
1574 2018-10-24 20:42:54 Please do... And also look at all the hemp by products that could replace oil by products... This carbon tax is a money grab!!
1575 2018-10-24 20:42:43 Is this acrylic or oil 
1576 2018-10-24 20:42:38 It’s in Vitalite. Considered it for a change last week as been a few years since I used it. Horrified to see palm oil in it. Renemver when it was sold as sunflower oil spread, sadly, no more.
1577 2018-10-24 20:42:37 ليه وش دخل 
1578 2018-10-24 20:42:25 Watching a programme about crisps.  Where does the oil come from?  The EU.  Crisp shortage after brexit?  That should please leave voters.  Just what they wanted.
1579 2018-10-24 20:42:20 My dad asked me to change the oil in my moms car. I go to O'Reilly's and get the oil and a new filter... 

He gets mad at me because he wanted me to take it in to a shop??

Like I would say rather just do the work myself, make sure it's done right, and save money??
1580 2018-10-24 20:42:03 I thought it would be festive to use cinnamon oil in my diffuser but instead my whole room smells like fireball and regret and I think I might puke
1581 2018-10-24 20:42:02 The market in Nigeria is not deregulated. Buhari is still paying outrageous subsidies. Do you still remember that Buhari increased fuel price bcos oil price was down and he needed more money to fund his greed?
In Nigeria, rise and fall of oil price is purely political!!!
1582 2018-10-24 20:41:58 Why the fuck was there a FUCKING container FULL OF FUCKING OIL IN THE PANTRY????? and not just IN the pantry, but on the EDGE OF THE FUCKING SHELF????? DID YOU WANT TO CREATE AN OIL SLICK IN THE KITCHEN????? DID YOU WANT ME TO SLIP AND DIE??????

1587 2018-10-24 20:40:39 The US national average gas price will likely drop to its lowest level since May 7 ($2.825/gal) by Saturday, and by next week will drop into the $2.70s for the first time since April. #gasprices #oil #OOTT
1588 2018-10-24 20:40:36 You should read the history. The British and the west regimes are the ones who planted them in the first place. They are their puppets tho ensure they receive their oil. These incidents are nothing odd, it happen all over the Middle East. Daily tens are killed and tortured.

1604 2018-10-24 20:39:15 Imagine being an oil exporting nation and vehicle manufacturer (mostly for export too), then telling your citizens they must use less oil and drive less.

1607 2018-10-24 20:39:03 I use sesame oil for thai but I appreciate the validity of your stance.

1610 2018-10-24 20:38:27 Which side is more " triggered?"
Conservatives generally not. We just stoically endure.
1611 2018-10-24 20:38:23 So, @Bertolli @AldiUK @Morrisons & #Vitalite (sunflower indeed(!) ), WHY do your spreads all contain palm oil? Have you any idea how destructive this use is? I won’t buy anything that encourages devastation of wildlife habitats for your cheap convenience. Black to @Lurpak for us
1612 2018-10-24 20:38:12 So this massage oil works

1614 2018-10-24 20:38:04 Most depressing phrase of the day from John Humphries about Saudi Arabia.

1625 2018-10-24 20:35:57 hasn't happened to me in a while (probably because I mostly smoke oil now) but none friends or I have ever figured out what this could be, besides a few possibilities like spidermites or strings used to hang up the bud or more likely some odd bits of stem

1627 2018-10-24 20:35:47 I watched a doc on body builders & those in comp use stuff like bisto & oil to cover their body, really pretty dark, to make sure their veins & muscles pop

1629 2018-10-24 20:35:39 la curva del oil que estaba tan saludable se aplano. El precio del oil en realidad es irrelevante, la curva lo dice todo.
1630 2018-10-24 20:35:38 This one chick got a whole ass vagina & has to buy oil to put in her whip, cuz she can’t afford an oil change. BIH... that vagina should be the key to a lifetime supply of oil changes.

1632 2018-10-24 20:35:25 Was it the Saudi clandestine forces who killed the guy - or did the hire it out to mercenaries? It is time to pressure these guys - raise our domestic oil production up & hit them where it hurts.

1640 2018-10-24 20:34:27 120 was overly exaggerated! 
You didn't say 110,
How about now?
Besides then oil price was not stable. It got to 70$ then.
Compare today oil price has been on elevation! Currently 85$..
Meaning we have excess of 100% money from the benchmark in our excess crude oil.

1693 2018-10-24 20:29:35 It won't decimate UK production. UK mainly sell goods such as cars, medicines & fuel eg oil. We sell mostly services.

1795 2018-10-24 20:18:19 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

1797 2018-10-24 20:18:12 What if he is pre-diabetic/ vegan? I find this highly offensive lol , we need - "Aapke mun main olive oil fairtrade organic sugar" - but then given ghee's high smoke point - avocado oil makes more sense in this context 
1798 2018-10-24 20:18:11 How could anyone put their trust in a oil company ???
1799 2018-10-24 20:18:05 Drill for that cum oil!
1800 2018-10-24 20:17:59 I understand that the New York attorney general has brought a lawsuit against Exxon for underplaying risks from climate change.  Canadian Imperial oil also mentioned for underestimating costs of carbon
1801 2018-10-24 20:17:56 Oil change complete. Heading to DeWitt to process paperwork
1802 2018-10-24 20:17:51 Blimey David....where did that come from.
Really impressed...
1803 2018-10-24 20:17:51 The kind of life I'm living no time
1804 2018-10-24 20:17:47 Yep, feels great right after a shower  I want to try sweet almond oil next, since my skin is a little on the dry side
1805 2018-10-24 20:17:44 You all better stop attacking Normani. You didn’t have that same energy to attack the racist opportunist canola oil. Normani is authentic and magnificent.

4. A part time journalist gets killed in Turkey (Saudi's did it, there goes oil, Trump's fault)

5. Fears over corporate earnings (though almost everyone keeps seeming to beat estimates).

6. The MSM making all 5 of those reasons appear to be valid.
1807 2018-10-24 20:17:27 #Scotsman 
"Report says North Sea #oil and #gas 'could be worth £300bn"
That's #Scotland's oil and gas,worth £300bn to Scotland if we're independent, squandered on foreign wars, monarchy, Lords and SE England projects if we're not. #indyref2_2019. Call it and face what comes, #FM
1808 2018-10-24 20:17:21 My sister: my oil light on, idk what that mean
Me: maybe your car needs oil..or an oil change...or you oil pressure is low ??? 
My sister: naw I don’t think it got anything to do w/ oil 

NIGGGGAAAA 
1809 2018-10-24 20:17:20 I’m buying some oil rn
1810 2018-10-24 20:17:04 You say real beauty is cruelty free but yet you continue to use palm oil.

1813 2018-10-24 20:16:59 I use Neutrogena oil free grapefruit face wash. Biore charcoal face cleanse & any oil (grapeseed)
Non-Product tips: wash your pillow case and sheets OFTEN. Wash your hats. Don't wash face with washcloth it carries dirt. Do this even when you have an off day at home. Stay happy.
1814 2018-10-24 20:16:52 Getting my car fix. Hopefully it's just an oil leak and that's all.
1815 2018-10-24 20:16:48 @CGasparino Charlie, with everything selling off, +gold, +oil, Stocks/Bonds are ppl selling and just holding it in cash? What are the big guys doing? Taking profits then selling short? Thanks.
1816 2018-10-24 20:16:46 The foolish virgins, had lamps but not enuf oil. The servant buried the talent. Yeshua said often - You can be in then out.. Your choice.
1817 2018-10-24 20:16:43 Over time, your engine parts (crankshaft, lifters, camshaft, etc.) will wear and/or warp excessively from lack of lubrication causing your motor to run poorly and eventually leading to engine failure. Change yo damn oil

1819 2018-10-24 20:16:38 Busisa you need to go to Chiredzi and see what Cabs has done with the sugar Cane farmers. They get their loans and pay back every year. It's so sad that in this day and age we still import soya beans for cooking oil and grain for mealie meal very embarrassing indeed.
1820 2018-10-24 20:16:33 Trump's best POTUS ever, he creates jobs, gets rid of job killing regs, cuts taxes & brings companys back from overseas.He's building a border wall, to stop illegal aliens, he opens Anwier & we become oil independent, he's a Nationalist, Loving USA, MAGA, KAGA, Trump's

1821 2018-10-24 20:16:23 These gorgeous jewels brought to you courtesy of Royal Dutch Shell and an enormous amount of oil.
1822 2018-10-24 20:16:15 Like when the bottom is like hurry up bruh, what you doing back there? Home boy is like lets slide some more oil to it and I can show you.
1823 2018-10-24 20:16:08 Try CBD oil it works wonders. Reply if you want to know morw
1824 2018-10-24 20:15:55 I like diffusing cedar wood oil mixed with orange WHILE sitting in my therapist’s office
1825 2018-10-24 20:15:44 di talaga ako hiyang sa sunflower oil ok next
1826 2018-10-24 20:15:41 Can I come? I’ve got gas though. It smells like weed from too much infused oil. I evacuated our car last night.
1827 2018-10-24 20:15:36 My sister is a stalker.. she knew I left work early yesterday for an oil change bc it sent an email to her phone 
1828 2018-10-24 20:15:32 Back in the day, I was trained on this.
These hit all the correct red flags - excess postage, to a person, large lumpy package - the only thing it is missing is 'oil spots', but they could be there.
This will be tracked down quickly enough, but sure seems like a set up.
1829 2018-10-24 20:15:30 My only resolution for 2019 is to ween myself off the oil lord’s saggy tib.
1830 2018-10-24 20:15:23 Such ridiculous excuse to skim more money off motorists. Punish the refineries and oil companies to provide cleaner emissions.  Another Trudeau belly flop
1831 2018-10-24 20:15:21 what became of it?, the same that happens to every good idea, the oil giants lobby it out of existence
1832 2018-10-24 20:15:14 the lifecycle of battery production does not compare to the lifecycle of a petrol car because that excludes the emissions of retrieving the oil and refining it into gasoline plus all the transportation from ground/sea to refinery to pump.
1833 2018-10-24 20:14:56 He won't Garrett trust me
1834 2018-10-24 20:14:55 Lmao it's pretty much as e rites it lots poverty unless ye in oil sector
1835 2018-10-24 20:14:52 My neighbors. "They work on the car too early on Saturday mornings. It leaves oil stains in the driveway. Please buy the book so perhaps they'll upgrade."
1836 2018-10-24 20:14:43 A few wks ago I tried to make glory bowl dressing. Didn't have any oil b/c the Mr gave away the bottle to our neighbour. A wk ago I tried to bake cookies, Mr gave away butter to same neighbour. Today I'm trying to bake muffins. I don't have baking soda. Guess what happened to it?
1837 2018-10-24 20:14:38 Please provide the sources. Consider the oil industry, perhaps as a country Canada is only at 1% - but it is also responsible for all the oil it sells which shows up as a statistic under another countries name. A number doesn't do this issue justice.
1838 2018-10-24 20:14:24 we are on the road to great things.
1839 2018-10-24 20:14:22 She's terrible, which makes her perfect for MSNBC. Their oil and defense advertisers don't want them to air anything meaningful, and they love the ratings from racists like Trump, so Kelly is a great fit.
1840 2018-10-24 20:14:22 Speculating #XRP price right now is like speculating on the price of oil when it was still in the ground as the industrial revolution was about to begin. Forget market cap, forget supply, forget day trading, mass utility is about to ensue. #XRPcommunity #Btc
1841 2018-10-24 20:14:19 Why is olive oil so expensive
1842 2018-10-24 20:14:14 This man smell like hot oil next to me
1843 2018-10-24 20:14:09 #JKLive South Sudan is a blessed country.. They are rich in oil and still they are languishing in poverty... Reason being poor leadership of their government.. If we Africans don't change our style of leadership we will forever remain behind @KoinangeJeff @citizentvkenya

1845 2018-10-24 20:14:02 No where near an amazing start if you're counterbalancing a carbon tax with endless oil pipelines. 

Btw "whataboutism" is just a way to deflect away from obvious hypocrisy. JT adopted Bernier's former leader's CO2 emissions targets and will not meet them.
1846 2018-10-24 20:14:01 To each their own! I think Oil Baron does lift the tide a bit when it comes to the other sketches. And Driver’s just doing such a good job at everything, even if he’s only given a little

1849 2018-10-24 20:13:43 I am not say that the travel ban is amoral; I am saying that it is largely incomplete. I will point out that Pakistan and Afghanistan are not on the list. I will even emphasize that Pakistan was hiding Bin Laden. In my opinion, the SA oversight is due to money and oil. [end]

1863 2018-10-24 20:12:34 Hello I know much abt the fuel increments and it isn’t the gov’ts doing sir. Mkt price of world crude oil is on the rise, and expected to shoot up more due to trade wars b/n oil rich countries.
1864 2018-10-24 20:12:30 Getting an oil change and this lady is complaining because they don’t have hot coco for her daughter at the Keurig 
1865 2018-10-24 20:12:26 3-Instead of subsidizing Big Chemical (incl. Big Oil, 
Big Pharma, Big Agri) tax them as high as the highest tax rate and pay for better education and basic housing and health care for ALL U.S. Citizens and residents!
1866 2018-10-24 20:12:16 They are reacting to the trade war, rising interest rates, a slowing housing market, geopolitical tensions, oil market volatility stemming from Trump's tearing up the Iran deal and increasing sanctions on their oil, major losses from Caterpillar brought about by steel tariffs..

1870 2018-10-24 20:11:24 No I'm not being dishonest. We could burn all 1.5 Trillion Barrels of Proven Oil left on earth and it wouldn't increase the CO2 concentration of the world's atmosphere much beyond 500ppm. 

The Earth's atmosphere weighs about 3 Trillion Metric Tonnes btw.

50+% of CO2 washes out.
1871 2018-10-24 20:11:19 So good. Toss it all in a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar before. You're welcome.
1872 2018-10-24 20:11:15 should saudi arabia  sanction EU  by cutting economic relations and oil due to killing millions of people around the world
1873 2018-10-24 20:11:10 Is the oil still liquid? I wonder what kind of chemical changes it underwent through this process?
1874 2018-10-24 20:10:59 Ooh! Do you keep oil burners perchance? The ones you use with a tealight and essential oil?
1875 2018-10-24 20:10:58 But sir this tweet is confusing. How is Buhari responsible for this? A market that is totally deregulated and void of subsidies it is expected that when oil prices rise the cost in that commodity should rise accordingly.

Not everything is political. Sometimes "Res ipsa loquitor"
1876 2018-10-24 20:10:26 Do you have cocamide or coconut oil or alo vera or soy in this product? Kelley <3
1877 2018-10-24 20:10:23 As a Lib I've often thought about how owned I'd be if the GOP nationalized our oil reserves, diverted the profit into clean energy infrastructure, and ceased drilling by 2025. Soooo owned.
1878 2018-10-24 20:10:20 …ぐぅ

1883 2018-10-24 20:09:57 Perhaps less and less of the oil money finds its way to normal people / consumers. Government re-filling the reserve funds?
1884 2018-10-24 20:09:45 If it makes you feel any better I live with 3 other South Indians who oil their hair every two days and I've to grease off the bath tub once in 3 days. They don't think it's OK when I confront them, they look at me as if I'm having hallucinations.
1885 2018-10-24 20:09:44 CIA & the energy corporations are at war with Venezuela. Financial warfare with oil, U.S sent agents in to buy up most of the groceries and products and then hide most of them. Others sent by U.S sold Venezuelan goods from inside Columbia to create drain on Venezuela currency.
1886 2018-10-24 20:09:38 Exfoliate your whole body them day coconut oil  ( or oil of your choice)
1887 2018-10-24 20:09:37 Business is business. Same oil, same oil.
1888 2018-10-24 20:09:24 Hi there. I live in Nordic country, Finland. My tax rate is 30-35% with about $60k per year. With that, I pay also good pension to myself. All my kids have free education from kindergarten to university. Health care is basically free too. And we don’t have oil etc. like you have.
1889 2018-10-24 20:09:06 And as the man takes a refreshing drink from his Mr. IPA-Nut, the overwhelming pressure from the carbonation mixes with the peanut oil, starting a chemical reaction that causes the can to explode into a thousand fiery bits.

I am interested in the causal connection of mining with farmer disposession & urban migration, in particular in Latin America.
As you know, mining (oil drilling is a form of mining) is at the core of anthropogenic climate change and environmental destruction.

1916 2018-10-24 20:06:18 The Financial Conduct Authority has changed its rules to allow foreign state-owned companies to be listed on the London Stock Exchange’s “premium category”. Insiders agree that the rules were altered to favour the Saudi-owned Aramco oil company.
1917 2018-10-24 20:06:09 SK throne speech is underway: trespass law changes coming but no details yet. No specific ag measures, but notes opposition to federal carbon tax and need to keep oil off rail to keep grain moving. #skpoli #saskag #WestCdnAg
1918 2018-10-24 20:06:08 I know how to check all of that and I even know how to change the oil (surprisingly) my dad taught me since he lives out of town and all
1919 2018-10-24 20:06:05 Exactly, Canada is still going to use oil whether it comes from our ground or from Venezuela, Saudi, Kuwait, etc..... Why penalize our economy, put our country first. We make zero difference on the global scale.
1920 2018-10-24 20:05:56 i've discovered a new sound more annoying than leaf blowers:

1924 2018-10-24 20:05:38 Thank you for monitoring for #oilspills. It is important that @DOIDepSec and @SecretaryZinke diligently ensure the oil and gas industry does not overpollute our air and water #publiclands
1925 2018-10-24 20:05:27 Someone should invent a self cleaning deep fat fryer.

I hadn't used it for a bit, congealed oil had turned into sort of glue on edges, it took a few minutes to prise it open, then emptied old oil, did a little token removal of bits of dried oil, it's never fully clean though.
1926 2018-10-24 20:05:21 I don’t know who’s daughter needed to hear this but, change your oil, put antifreeze in your radiator, check your tire pressure, and watch for ice on bridges.

Birds of a feather...
1928 2018-10-24 20:05:15 @mirna_abdulaal as u're interested in Gulf politics there's a book called  " The Oil Curse " I suggest you to read it
1929 2018-10-24 20:05:07 Coolant is every 100k miles, synthetic oils last between 5k-10k miles but the longer you wait the more it breaks down. Lights won’t always indicate a need for servicing either. Your oil light usually comes on when it’s too late, if it ever does come on.
1930 2018-10-24 20:04:57 Aw, sorry, it’s been discontinued, Steph. I use our hand or body cream, or Superskin Concentrate oil on my feet now. Hope that helps. Any questions, do ask or @lizearle too X
1931 2018-10-24 20:04:38 Make sure the oil change guys don’t follow you on Twitter 
1932 2018-10-24 20:04:11 How sad ! A sprawling city with fun and laughter turned into ruins. How far the dirty politics can go to achieve its diabolic reward? History will never forget or forgive  George Bush Jr for this criminal act of destroying a country on false pretexts with greed for its rich oil.
1933 2018-10-24 20:04:10 Guy in the audience, who isnt w/industry (said he is here as an individual) asked if there are any studies that have published incidents of diseases/illness on oil and gas workers. Speakers unaware of any. Followed up, "wouldnt that be a natural place to start?" Good question.
1934 2018-10-24 20:04:07 What are #ukog doing with the oil going to hamble?? You know they are selling it right? Currently the biggest producer in the weald. Fact.

1936 2018-10-24 20:03:35 I wth my dad better take me shopping tomorrow I need oil paints and cheescake
1937 2018-10-24 20:03:32 I need a oil change 
1938 2018-10-24 20:03:21 But of course he does... I can hear him now "I'm going to get the oil folks. I'm going to drill. I'm really going to baby drill. We need the oil folks. We need to drill. And it will be so clean. You better believe it baby. We're going to baby drill baby!"... Sigh...
1939 2018-10-24 20:03:03 I usually do. I use the Shea moisture body oil then I use Vaseline. My skin absorbs it 
1940 2018-10-24 20:02:57 I use triamcinolone cream which helps with my psoriasis. Have you tried just putting regular petroleum jelly on it?

Sometimes I use baby oil all over my body too lol
1941 2018-10-24 20:02:55 Now Mr Ross has roped in Mr Whale Oil to help fight his battles. Didn't Judith Collins and Bevan Chuang and Len Brown already have a bad track record when liasing with this one.
1942 2018-10-24 20:02:50 Not construction no. Like oil or tobacco, yes.
1943 2018-10-24 20:02:46 Every time I see a big heavy oil train going over the hundred year old bridge from Pwi Di Go Zhing Ne Yah Zhing - to Rainier Minnesota I know we are taking risks that will someday be the ruin of some very important and sacred places #FPIC #Treaty3

If our regulations were used world wide we would reduce emissions 
Replacing coal with LNG reduces emissions
1946 2018-10-24 20:02:23 Wait have them swap apple sauce for oil, brownies won't be as bad ?
1947 2018-10-24 20:02:22 Oh dear. Next time just simmer a tin of plum tomatoes with some olive oil, a clove of garlic, & a pinch of sea salt and of chili flakes for a few minutes. #womansplaining

1955 2018-10-24 20:01:35 Nothing that I’m aware of. I’m just agreeing with that guy who said that some women don’t do regular checkups of their own car. I’ve never checked my own oil or coolant.
1956 2018-10-24 20:01:30 It’s unfair & biased to Somali regional State of Ethiopia to be nominated only 3 positions out of 55 State ministers.

1969 2018-10-24 20:00:21 That is good info. My concern is to get inflation right we have to get oil right. Oil making lower highs is not bullish for inflation expectations.

1976 2018-10-24 19:59:34 Because to put something into production costs a lot, like oil. Many employed so we don't wanna loose jobs. Keep the crude flowing at all cost. Or should I use the arms industry. How does a country market arms? By creating an outlet. Once going can't stop. The list goes on...

1992 2018-10-24 19:58:04 Also not a big fan of that (no power on Earth can stop the oil from slopping over the sides), but I've discovered a pretty good solution: As soon as you get home with your PB, store the jar upside-down.  After a few hours, little or no stirring will be necessary!

1995 2018-10-24 19:57:57 Next, the Senate passed an energy bill in 2005. This bill aimed at supporting traditional energy industries of oil and natural gas, but also provide tax incentives for the use of alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power! :)

2065 2018-10-24 19:51:07 The problem with these claims is that almost invariably the kind of fat is not reported unless you dig into the actual papers (and sometimes not even then), and when you do get the details, it's always some inflammatory industrial vegetable oil garbage.

2068 2018-10-24 19:51:00 I know your profile but I love to reply in layman term so tweet reader can understand too.  (well why do you think it is a commodity?) first all it is for subsidy on oil. not for reserves, I think you need to redo your profile, boss :)
2069 2018-10-24 19:50:56 No they say stupid things like you and try to stop pipelines and force that oil to be moved by trucks and trains

2075 2018-10-24 19:50:27 If Melton rules in favor of Abina, it might encourage other slave girls to follow in Abina's footsteps, which would put a halt to palm oil production which would harm the economy. #HIST125007F18 #AbinaDisc

Have you hugged an oil bull today?
2080 2018-10-24 19:49:56 This is where Trump should play cards right and create peace with Iran ,they’ve got too much oil too.
2081 2018-10-24 19:49:49 No, I mean change. Every 3 months or 3000 miles you should drain and replace the oil and put in a new filter. More if you drive on dirt roads.
2082 2018-10-24 19:49:44 Something going on in #Canada that I’m not aware of? Somebody established a communist economic system? $CNQ $BTE $CVE $CPG #oil $HSE $SU
2083 2018-10-24 19:49:38 I really thought the little genie lamp would tell you when to get your oil changed  The sticker was just a gentle guideline.
2084 2018-10-24 19:49:32 If Khashoggi was in negotiations involving oil and natural gas, that means we have a Russian/Syrian angle. We also know that turkey and the saudis will not be happy if their beloved pipeline just became a pipe dream when U.s sold natural gas to Germany undercutting them.
2085 2018-10-24 19:49:29 ...his sense of smell and ability to discern when lavender is in an essential oil is incredible though for 3!
2086 2018-10-24 19:49:21 .@FrancoMancaPizz I purchased a bottle of your chilli oil (very good) recently but I have finished it. Someone told me that you offer free refills - is there any truth in this? Please let me know, as my pantry is now lacking a star ingredient. Many thanks. #W4

2105 2018-10-24 19:47:29 It's the simple things that make me feel like I have my life together. Ya know, like getting an oil change or checking things off your 'To-Do' list.
2106 2018-10-24 19:47:22 Lmao you dont got a oil stick either ?
2107 2018-10-24 19:47:18 Friends and growth are like oil and water.

2113 2018-10-24 19:46:51 So I’m trying to get my oil changed and they guy pops his head in my car & asked if he could text me. 
2114 2018-10-24 19:46:46 Shahzaib becoming another big reason of GEO downfall by his own silly mistakes.

2117 2018-10-24 19:46:38 I do similar - after each session, I take out the needle and give it a wipe with cleaner and oil. Then do the same again before the next session, also cleaning the nozzle at the same time. Takes ~5 minutes and saves much hassle.
2118 2018-10-24 19:46:33 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and the purpose of keeping out criminals.
2119 2018-10-24 19:46:15 Yes snr mechanic,whose oil did u change
2120 2018-10-24 19:45:57 Ahhh well done sir!
2121 2018-10-24 19:45:48 Senior lawyers have explained the implication of the Supreme Court verdict that more revenue should accrue to oil-producing states when oil price exceeds $20 per barrel.
2122 2018-10-24 19:45:21 I don’t know who grandchild needs to hear this, BT STOP PROCRASTINATING N GO GET YOUR CAR A FUCKING OIL CHANGE 
2123 2018-10-24 19:45:19 I got my oil changed and left my car there all day and it cost less than parking next door
2124 2018-10-24 19:45:11 At least my oil leak is fixed , just need to replace plugs

2126 2018-10-24 19:45:08 I wonder what smelly @KellyODwyer and our nations resident snake oil peddler, @ScottMorrisonMP have to say about this?
2127 2018-10-24 19:45:07 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

2129 2018-10-24 19:44:57 @ru_gov Russia's sale of oil and gas is harming the U.S. dollar, and therefore the economy. Without the dollar backed oil & gas trade, the U.S. dollar loses primacy as an international reserve currency. Israel and the USA cannot have that, that is why they are provoking for war.
2130 2018-10-24 19:44:57 Coconut oil is a curls best friend!
2131 2018-10-24 19:44:50 In the US, it is also gasoline and oil that get subsidies I believe. "Aus" probably refers to Australia. Oh, and Elon Musk sorted out some big problems with renewable power generation down there too, mostly with a battery.
2132 2018-10-24 19:44:49 1. Price per barrel is not fixed, it will be on the government's  subsidize value which for People of Pakistan will be a relief on oil prices
2. Deposit is not on the interest rate (that is why it is deposit) however this deposit is promised on investment opportunity to Saudia
2133 2018-10-24 19:44:46 Discovered today that an oil change at the @subaru_usa dealership is actually cheaper than one @Valvoline. Adulthood is finding the better deal on oil changes...
2134 2018-10-24 19:44:36 Will oil prices fall now in Pakistan if Saudi Arabia has given oil to Pakistan? Will oil prices fall short in Pakistan Pakistan oil will sell 50 to 55 rupees

2141 2018-10-24 19:44:03 Apparently the drug and oil money is swapped for guns and resources between certain rebels and jihadists down there. Again, I’m a fuckin idiot, these are just things dudes tell me who have no reason to lie.
2142 2018-10-24 19:43:49 Hmm. This week’s Jetta test car wants a quart of oil. Turns out that 0W-20 is still too rare and exotic for either my neighborhood supermarket or gas station.

2150 2018-10-24 19:43:08 I've got some strange muffins in the oven. I subbed coconut oil for butter because we're somehow out of the former (this should never be) which I beat in solid rather than melted and replaced the milk and sugar with applesauce. I then mixed in raisins for additional sweetness.
2151 2018-10-24 19:43:04 I’m very very oily and lately I’ve felt oily and yet dehydrated but niacinamide seems to be doing the trick in controlling oil production! I went until 3pm without having to blot today (usually need to blot by 11am)
2152 2018-10-24 19:43:03 Lol. You're just mad your money was taken. I said it was a nice cliff, and indeed it was. Landed safely. I don't blindly buy oil based on "OMG Iran!" or any headline. Oh well. Steak on you tonight. By the way. The patterns on charts you use are sometimes used incorrectly.
2153 2018-10-24 19:42:57 Within construction specifically or are you talking about oil and gas companies?

2157 2018-10-24 19:42:21 I've worked, worked out, changed the oil in my vehicle, and it's only 2:30. I could get use to these types of days.

2165 2018-10-24 19:41:49 The exact oil is way better. However it was outta my price range today. And I needed something to calm my mind. Gummies and the honey is the next best way

2208 2018-10-24 19:39:07 The signal the Saoudi government sent now is: we don't care about those international conventions at all. All we do is exploit our embassies to get what we want. Don't count on us if you want to negotiate oil prices or 40K lives.

2214 2018-10-24 19:38:33 I wanted to try something different for lunch today so I bought an acorn squash so I roasted it in olive oil and stuffed it with garlic, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, and jalepenos and bitch. Why the fuck didn’t anyone tell me how good squash was. I’m disappointed in all of you.
2215 2018-10-24 19:38:26 In shower: So ya know I cleaned my body w my usual soaps (dial & cetaphil). Then, I used #theoriginalcoffeescrub, let that sit for 4 Summer Walker songs lol, rinsed it off & then followed up w a shower oil by L’Occitane (it was so luxurious)
2216 2018-10-24 19:38:25 The clue should have been when oil companies speak in favor of fighting climate change. That's like car companies advocating for better public transport. You know it's bullshit.
2217 2018-10-24 19:38:19 Sorry about your leg but it would seem you're setting a price for the thousands of american lives lost as well as your own sacrifice. Trading lives for oil is clearly a common practice already but why would you support that?

2219 2018-10-24 19:37:56 I adore my small-town mechanic, but their business has increased dramatically since another mechanic closed up shop. Thus, I’m at JiffyLube for an oil change. When I pulled in, the two middle-aged white dudes working said, “We’re out of oil,” and this is why I hate JiffyLube
2220 2018-10-24 19:37:50 Perhaps, but more than a few do not go into cali because of regs and compliance issues. Its costly and nerve wracking. 
Cali based fleets handle a lot of freight at least till it exits the state.
2221 2018-10-24 19:37:18 hate waiting on my oil change

2234 2018-10-24 19:35:47 We did this ion the grill this summer and loved it so much we did it again the next week. We marinated it with olive oil, lemon, and dill. So juicy and good!!  My friend gave  me an excellent recipe (I was worried because of the grilling time, but it was done to perfection)

2251 2018-10-24 19:33:21 there needs to be a way to recover and filter oil from sea water, were ruining our planet. Use sea algae and carbon to make batteries. collect and filter harmful algae blooms with carbon filter barges containing pine tree charcoal. save our fish, clean up micro plastic.

2259 2018-10-24 19:32:34 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently they had the publisher of the National Enquirer on their board, they have a stated mandate to support the oil companies at all costs and want American style conservatism to rule Canada. It is propaganda, not news.

2264 2018-10-24 19:32:21 Children of Salva Kiir are shareholders in major South Sudan oil companies, major banks & other companies that directly do business with the government.

2267 2018-10-24 19:31:55 Where are you located? Are you in a legal state? CBD oil (real stuff) not the fake crap they try and mail you. Or Kratom (so?) Works to but can be addictive so be careful with that one. Also cut out sugar as inflammation is huge systemically in many of us. Hope it helps 
2268 2018-10-24 19:31:53 Goodyear really just tried charging me $450 all I asked for was an OIL CHANGE!!!!!!!
2269 2018-10-24 19:31:49 Actually Velveeta makes for excellent wallboard joint compound in a pinch. I'm also pretty sure when it dries it can be a 2:1 thickness substitute for ballistic gelly. Never tried to seal an automotive oil leak, but like WD-40 I'm sure the list of useful substitutes is endless...

2286 2018-10-24 19:29:56 This is not an attempt to stop people of using carbon based fuel, it is lining the pockets of the government and that is all. Paying for a pipeline that no one wants for oil to be moved across the country, don’t kid yourself that this is in our favour.
2287 2018-10-24 19:29:56 So according to Salva Kiir, it was Riek Machar, General Malong and others who looted but not himself? This hypocrisy stinks to high heavens. Kiir through his children  literally owns all national banks, all national oil companies and anything that belongs to the nation #JKLive

2293 2018-10-24 19:29:19 No we don't need  to shut it down we just need to stop burning it.  There are other things we can do with it inc producing hydrogen from gas & converting the CO2, using oil for plastics (degradable as well) and so on. It's a chemists wet dream @harry_miras

2315 2018-10-24 19:27:32 Plastic is cheap and free to product! It is made from fossil fuel, from oil. For now the control is a must and free production denied. Cheapness is a problem as told by that process in beginning, and carelessness is having the consequences.

2323 2018-10-24 19:26:49 Saudi terrorists invaded US on 9/11 and the west invaded Afghanistan instead, safe to say MBS is staying put, in the geopolitical chess of oil, Israel and Iran, Americans will always pussyfoot

2336 2018-10-24 19:25:58 That's not the only thing that's being covered up! During the BP disaster our parent company developed a new technology that's able to stop all types of blowouts & offshore leaks in as little as 1-2 days, but the oil & gas companies haven't shown any interest in it! Know why?

2358 2018-10-24 19:23:34 I feel bad for this lady in the oil change waiting room... She seems to be constantly out of breath. This is the second woman I've encountered this week to be so winded.
2359 2018-10-24 19:23:34 Can we afford to pay the Glasgow women workers 12 yrs back pay. Probably not. but it's the right thing to do. Same rules apply to the oil. We only have 1 planet
2360 2018-10-24 19:23:32 I’m at the dealership getting an oil change and the guy helping me asked if I want to go get lunch with him while I wait for my car to be ready lmfakjsosksksks 
2361 2018-10-24 19:23:25 I went to jiffy lube to get my oil changed & I asked for sinthetic oil & she had the nerve to say $90 when I can easily get it at Walmart for $30. They tried to play me lol
2362 2018-10-24 19:23:17 yes, tokido is a lab monster, those little things are what makes the difference in matches on a very high level. But I feel gachikun is playing him more and more perfect now. Oil King is strong in offense with him !

2370 2018-10-24 19:22:31 Very true. Some poor handling there. But Hugo's challenge judgement seems to be getting worse exponentially game by game.
2371 2018-10-24 19:22:28 Sigh.

We have the dirtiest oil on the planet.

Now LNG, and you are saying our emissions won't make a difference ?

Also, shipping that dirty oil to be refined in India and China is just stupid.

We are doing this. The majority voted for it, and will re-elect Libs to do it.

2379 2018-10-24 19:21:28 Weatern support radical group including Iran and we have NOT seen this amount of media coverage to show the western people who Iran is destroying the region because they like that to steal the Oil.
2380 2018-10-24 19:21:25 There's no need for a West-East pipeline to go to the Atlantic provinces. Energy East was meant only to export oil. Bitumen needs to be refined in Alberta and the finished product sent to Ontario to supply the Eastern half of the country only. #cdnpoli

2383 2018-10-24 19:21:11 The FOM issue is raised by people who blame their laziness on foreigners. When the oil income was providing for a cosy living on benefits, whole generations preferred to live off the state instead of working. But companies needed a workforce, so they employed foreigners.
2384 2018-10-24 19:21:09 Just read up on the story, who do you think Leo will play? No way in this climate is he going to represent a Native American so assuming he'll play a oil lord

2386 2018-10-24 19:21:02 It feels so obvious, don't you think? The average person does not have interests in things like hedge funds, oil companies, pharmaceuticals etc....but so often there are links between MPs/peers' interests and the committees etc they sit on. Old boys network. Rediculous.

2390 2018-10-24 19:20:21 Bob,,, @Veikkoleh is right!!! We here in oil country are disgusted with how this team brings players in and what they do with them. Then watch them go only to succeed somewhere else. Stop blaming players for organizations lack of talent! Oilers fan for 39 years.

2393 2018-10-24 19:20:15 The story  revolves around the Osage Nation, who were the richest people per capita in the world, after oil was discovered under their land and then they were murdered, one by one. As the death toll rose, the newly created FBI took up the case

2395 2018-10-24 19:19:58 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2396 2018-10-24 19:19:39 Yes!! Studies show men can gain at least 1-2 inches length and girth by JELQING WITH ENTENGO MULONDO OIL !!! BUY IT ON AMAZON OR BONANZA !!!
2397 2018-10-24 19:19:39 I put hot oil in my bf beard every two weeks. Also just leave it alone so it can grow. Just shape it sometimes.
2398 2018-10-24 19:19:34 Why would he want to buy resources from another country while he already plans to create them in the U.S.? I think Canada could learn something from this, especially when it comes to our oil and maple syrup.

2400 2018-10-24 19:19:17 "New York is suing Exxon Mobil, accusing it of defrauding shareholders by downplaying the risks of climate change to its business." So, uhh, destroying the world is bad for oil companies' business too?
2401 2018-10-24 19:19:15 Try thin sliced sweet potato chips you can easily make. Thin oil & seasoning. Costco has an air fryer for $60 bucks. Also good in thicker slices, get outside a bit hard, inside is delicious and softer. Creativity w/ healthy food and you realize those foil packed things are insane

2403 2018-10-24 19:19:05 How much more difficult is it to upgrade heavy oil to synthetic crude rather than dilbit?
2404 2018-10-24 19:19:01 Stop it you internet troll. Sure CO2 comes out of our mouths but any burning of fossil fuel is adding CO2 that was trapped in the earth (in oil, coal, gas,..) into the atmosphere. That is what causes the Climate Catastrophe.

2411 2018-10-24 19:18:26 I’m going to assume this is when you’re adding additives to the oil, correct? Using the correct weight should get you by just fine.
2412 2018-10-24 19:18:21 The things keeping green energy from being fully embraced are artificial, due to lobbying from the oil and gas industry.

2420 2018-10-24 19:17:34 Nigerians don't cease to amaze me, years of waste, no plans for the future, decay of infrastructure on all levels, we didn't complain, because oil money was sufficient.

Oil money drops, revenue drops, hardship sets in, hidden problems begin to unravel, then we blame Buhari.
2421 2018-10-24 19:17:33 This is why I always have misgivings about fish canned in oil, even if the label says it's "olive oil."

2424 2018-10-24 19:17:23 That's what we do!  :)    I think a lot of very wealthy parents (many here work in oil and gas industry) work long hours and don't spend much time with kids.  So, lavish party is supposed to somehow make up from it.  But that's my own anecdotal perspective.
2425 2018-10-24 19:17:16 Great oil analogy mark.
2426 2018-10-24 19:16:53 oil & gas tankers, no?  When u leave NOLA on plane & look down at Mississippi to see all the LNG terminals, it's a shocking reality of how far we have to go to save civilization.

2436 2018-10-24 19:16:09 I would argue that its role in the oil economy is just another thing it is “backed” by and another aspect of the overarching US + USD system. Satoshi didn’t stockpile gold before he created btc, still a valid system.

2440 2018-10-24 19:15:46 I said things like that 6 or 7 yrs ago and have been wrong ever since through high prices, low prices & company bankruptcies. Most smart money fully accepts peak oil as an investment strategy & always has.

2447 2018-10-24 19:14:46 Thanks for sharing and come back anytime. We'd like to clarify that we have the capacity to produce approx. 40 million gallons of biodiesel annually. CT consumers can call their retailers and ask for American GreenFuels certified biodiesel to be added to their heating oil.
2448 2018-10-24 19:14:45 Why does the government take interest in bailing out companies and thereby taking over the debt from fraudulent CEOs? Does it work like this in other functioning economies?

2462 2018-10-24 19:13:03 You have very tight tolerance in most motors, they have very small holes to shoot oil into certain areas. Crank bearings, cam bearings, valves, rockers, etc. oil that is too thick/heavy can’t get to these areas as easy.

2465 2018-10-24 19:12:39 Key phrase "as long as investors keep giving." Maybe debt investors but equity will get tired if returns don't materialize.  When oil was over $100, shale could make money and not plow it all back into capex.
2466 2018-10-24 19:12:27 That’s a long wait for an oil change!

2468 2018-10-24 19:12:25 This is going to blow your mind, but they have come up with a way to store electricity for weeks, even months.
I've seen really small versions of these things last years even!

Upto Last week SGSS Indian oil Balkampet, Hyderabad has accepted and now they are also not accepting, please look into this
2474 2018-10-24 19:11:31 It is abundantly clear that the most powerful ppl on earth--oil and gas oligarchs & the politicians they own--not only won't act on global warming, they WANT it (and fast!) because they will profit from access to arctic and from instability and war.
2475 2018-10-24 19:11:19 I just dropped off my car to get my oil changed I’m such a healthy capable adult
2476 2018-10-24 19:11:11 Ha, you know how the oil industry and its allies like @dpfdpf have told people that NZ uses the oil it drills (and hence if we didn’t drill we would import ‘dirtier’ oil) well it ain’t true. We export the oil and import transport oil.
2477 2018-10-24 19:11:10 I come in for an oil change at 1230 y’all say it’s an hour wait...I ask for another minor repair which is an additional 45 mins...YALL GOT MY CAR FOR 3 HOURS
2478 2018-10-24 19:11:07 Is it a vinegar or an oil? With that color: Vinegar- meh, could be pretty tame. Oil- going to be a rough night.
2479 2018-10-24 19:10:58 Feels like there is a bit of jostling going on and people being put back in line. I suspect there will be false flag attacks to follow on from this fiasco before things settle back2 business as usual starve Yemen, bomb Syria, steal oil, kill Palestinians oh &accuse Iran of things
2480 2018-10-24 19:10:47 Quite the Lib kool-aid party in Ottawa. Keep importing offshore oil. You serm to be very quiet on that matter, yet live in #yeg.
2481 2018-10-24 19:10:40 Eyebrows 

Try to pluck, Wax or get your eyebrows threaded about once a month this will help them stay clean and sharp without using a concealer or brow product. Also use castor oil or Vaseline to make your eyebrows grow and thicken

2491 2018-10-24 19:09:37 Because the government controls the price of oil and what a retailer profits. Good one Louie.

2493 2018-10-24 19:09:36 "a second-tier material in any form" This dude just likes hearing himself talk. It's literally ground peanuts, with maybe some oil and if it's mass-market, sugar.
2494 2018-10-24 19:09:34 Saudi prince like the oil is full of shit. These over power, treacherous , unhuman beings are the scum of this planet. no democracy, no voice, no religion freedom. It what these scum bags decide is right. Oil Gods sad
2495 2018-10-24 19:09:27 Most of distillates are from the heavy sour part of the blend w/ minimal contribution from the light oil. Benefit of the light is low sulfur content.
2496 2018-10-24 19:09:24 where will they keep getting cash like this to hand out? They are not doing well economically - at least not at the current prices of oil.

2502 2018-10-24 19:08:26 The Dollar is counterfeit without Gold/Silver redemption,  the dollar is only propped up by the fact that every country Must Sell Their Local Currency for Dollar to BUY OIL, not faith or anything like that, it’s been built into the system
2503 2018-10-24 19:08:07 Why isn't Imran Khan talking about the cost of maintaing a division of Pakistani Army in KSA as Personal Security Detachment of the Saudi Royal family? 

Imagine if the Saudi's had to rent a division from the US? We're protecting US oil interests for NOTHING!

2508 2018-10-24 19:07:39 Really all anyone wants, when you boil it down, is a comfortable life, and some semblance of peace and contentment. So when a snake oil salesman comes and tells you that he’s going to make all your troubles disappear, how can you not believe him when you’re truly desperate

2513 2018-10-24 19:07:18 Shale is unique b/c it doesn't have to be profitable as long as investors keep giving companies $. That's b/c oil is master resource and always a reasonable investment even if companies don't have good performance. Conventional reserves too small to move the needle on supply.
2514 2018-10-24 19:07:17 You're just a dumb anti-canadian leftard,you know NOTHING,95+% of SAGD water is recuperated and recycled,..you prefer GULF oil over ours,yeah,real smart,great for our economy....go live out in the woods,no oil,no fossil fuels,put your money where your ugly socialist mouth is..

2517 2018-10-24 19:06:59 Valid question. Up until Barack Obama,  Democrat leadership held the exact same position on illegal immigration as R's now. Feinstein,Reid on wages, birthright citizenship. Moving back in this direction would result in reform. 
MSM ignores this, why?

2527 2018-10-24 19:05:53 The mistake should not be repeated but used as a learning.

The deferred payment for oil purchases is not waived but just extended to 3 years matching exactly with first CPEC payments while no revenue from CPEC visible and terms for immediate transfer of 3Bn is pending disclosure

2551 2018-10-24 19:03:21 Listen...throw some garlic in the pan with the oil, saute the well-chopped kale with a nice shake of sea-salt til slick & shiny & serve with crusty Italian Bread and hot red pepper flakes.  If you're not vegan grate some Pecorino Romano cheese over it.  I promise, you'll love it!
2552 2018-10-24 19:03:17 about "lack of liquidity." Yes. The Zionists want the Saudis' money and their oil. They tried to take over Qatar, first, but the emir briskly moved under Russian (Iran, China and Turkey) umbrella, and now is having tea with halva and laughing at stupid pompous camel lovers.

2594 2018-10-24 18:59:02 It’s rare cause it taste like motor oil and sugar lmfao
2595 2018-10-24 18:58:57 on the plus side, if you have any interest in buying the royalty stream of an Ecuadorian oil project on the cheap, brother, you are in luck
2596 2018-10-24 18:58:53 Awesome! I always keep a bowl of Sichuan chili oil handy in the kitchen.. goes really well with dal :)
2597 2018-10-24 18:58:40 The article actually used the £330bn that would be spent to extract the oil and gas. eg. wages for oil workers, equipment, service contracts, accommodation, travel, etc, etc. The total value of the oil & gas in the article came out a c£890bn at $60 per barrel and 50p per therm
2598 2018-10-24 18:58:37 Go check the oil
2599 2018-10-24 18:58:31 Do you know how much money US has spent in Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan? More than all that oil is valued several times over. War for oil is stupid.
2600 2018-10-24 18:58:26 But not the oil.....and will never be.....get real...
2601 2018-10-24 18:58:18 Not true.  My heating oil bill increased 21 cents per gallon.  Up from zero tax.  A necessity should not be taxed this way.  $400 or more per year in sales tax on heating oil. By the way, no tax if you buy from gas station. No.2 fuel oil.
2602 2018-10-24 18:58:12 For me, the issue I have with this scene, and the whole Oil Refinery mission, is that it is filler. Lara doesn't really grow throughout this mission, Jonah is completely fine so him getting hurt in anyway is also pointless and even Lara's breakdown at the end doesn't really
2603 2018-10-24 18:58:07 Antisthenes or Doodlebugger?
Antisthenes was the founder of classical cynicism (circa 400 BC)
A doodlebugger is someone who records or processes seismic data (not the earthquake kind, but rather for finding oil & gas)
2604 2018-10-24 18:58:06 No cap oil changes really change a car
2605 2018-10-24 18:57:57 Every single prominent dimm has held similar positions.  If the left really wanted action on immigration, MSM would be running these clips nonstop.  Fact they are not says everything

2608 2018-10-24 18:57:47 You absolutely have no idea how the State Department works. People can’t just walk into America and become citizens. Stop listening to snake oil salesmen.
2609 2018-10-24 18:57:41 Yo momma so fat everytime she walks in high heels, she strikes oil!
2610 2018-10-24 18:57:40 Justin approved of the KinderMorgan pipeline instead of a clean energy, then used our money to bail out a US oil company. It's also hypocritical that TAXPAYERS have to be taxed instead of the energy companies responsible for this pollution, which is subsidizing them. 
2611 2018-10-24 18:57:38 I'm not saying they should stop, just that it's oil into the fire right now

2613 2018-10-24 18:57:35 I was talking about Kuwait. That was the first war. US never went into Baghdad. Only freed Kuwait. As for oil, petrol prices were very high after second Iraq war. I never understand why Russians are so focused on Libya?
2614 2018-10-24 18:57:24 I pull up to Honda for my oil change and a mechanic is outside smoking while riding a hover board lmfaooo

2618 2018-10-24 18:57:08 Actually socialism often leads to communism.   They often go hand in hand.  They are not oil and water
2619 2018-10-24 18:57:06 Do I dab the rose oil on my body and light the candle before I begin to write?
2620 2018-10-24 18:56:58 I’m also unconvinced and I’m certainly not doing it. It’s warm olive oil and a cotton wool ball for him and failing that the nurse at the doc’s can sort it. Whole thing is making me retch. #earwax
2621 2018-10-24 18:56:49 I remember an Oil of Olay commercial from when I was 4.
2622 2018-10-24 18:56:42 Every time someone says this I wonder what they make of baby oil.
2623 2018-10-24 18:56:32 This sounds like pure gibberish and nonsense to me. 75% of the money that goes into the PFD comes from Oil, Gas, and mining.  Budgets fluctuate based on revenue,.which has been dismal as of recent., under Walker. let’s be real here.
2624 2018-10-24 18:56:29 #Trump #whitehouse is DE-regulating the pollution of our water & air.
They ignore Climate Science in order to justify Gov subsidies & tax-breaks for Oil & Fracking, and they want to Give-Away our public forests & recreation areas to Big-Biz.
They're destroying America's Future.
2625 2018-10-24 18:56:25 Also, sheer bullshit.  @realDonaldTrump, always the snake oil salesman is as sincere as...well, yesterday’s Trump; totally, completely, and irrevocably insincere.

2630 2018-10-24 18:56:13 I suspect getting a HP that meets peak demand now and is efficient/cost effective post retrofit will be challenging; heat load will be reduced by a factor of ~10. That was why I was thinking of combining with oil boiler for now. Need to catch up with all the replies about that!
2631 2018-10-24 18:56:07 Why my car dont tell me my oil percentage? the oil light aint come on yet so ig ion need it...
2632 2018-10-24 18:56:06 Always good to hear from Capt Andrew however...why is Squirrel Oil capitalized?
2633 2018-10-24 18:55:58 Aucun pays n’a opéré une transition énergétique avec une baisse des émissions de 5%/an, chercher dans le passé est vain pour s’en inspirer sur ce point...
2634 2018-10-24 18:55:45 i know it affects activity of sebaceous (oil) glands in your skin (hence how it makes your skin clearer and less breakout-prone), and those are also present in every hair follicle
2635 2018-10-24 18:55:44 Traders who see technical analysis as a means of generating mechanical buy and sell signals usually lose money constantly in oil trading.
2636 2018-10-24 18:55:37 I heard coconut oil throws off your bodies natural PH balance. I’ve never had trouble with water based lube. It seems to be clearing up fast. I’m gonna take a vinegar bath though I head that helps too
2637 2018-10-24 18:55:36 I don't know if you know this, but you'll have to return those 3 billion dollars worth of oil that you're gonna buy on deferred payment plan.

2641 2018-10-24 18:55:14 Like the time he said if you like your Dr. you can keep your Dr.? Or how about the time he said the Republicans filibustered 500 pieces of legislation? Or the time he said keystone pipeline is for oil that bypasses the US? I can keep going!!
2642 2018-10-24 18:55:14 I'm no doctor . But I have read interesting things about CBD  oil and micro dosing on Psilocybin mushrooms and their nullifying effect on depression. I know some people prefer a path that doesn't lead to destroying your organs with antidepression meds. Hope it helps!good luck !

2648 2018-10-24 18:54:21 Demolish Lucas Oil Stadium and make it a new Clickhole Oral History about The Sopranos and it sucks now.
2649 2018-10-24 18:54:12 In light of recent events I would be willing to take the hike in gas prices just to stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia. Only as long as Energy East was put back on the table and approved so it would be short lived buts its a PIPE DREAM get it?
2650 2018-10-24 18:54:07 I always buy big, it’s the things I think I don’t need I always end up needing. Like that brush soap that is actually better than Murphy’s Oil soap but it’s a good economical alternative. I’m mostly spending $ on containers & paint honestly
2651 2018-10-24 18:53:42 IIRC the CER estimate was based on a snake oil guess were the UK would be based on a basket of countries weighted towards USA & Hungary. It would seem countries that elected leaders like Trump & Orban have done well.

2661 2018-10-24 18:52:49 Maybe he could try CBD oil.
2662 2018-10-24 18:52:48 @RachelNotley has crippled the Alberta oil industry to say otherwise is completely neglecting the obvious.

2664 2018-10-24 18:52:36 Anything that’s imported. I started with tinned tomatoes, olive oil, olives, chick peas, dried pulses, rice, pasta, corned beef, tinned fish, frozen peppers.
2665 2018-10-24 18:52:29 the oil separates and it looks like shyt!!
2666 2018-10-24 18:52:21 I visited a school near an oil refinery, with an adjacent dry cleaner whose ventilation system exhausted next to the school playground. They did regular air quality testing in the school, but I can't imagine that being on the playground near dry cleaning exhaust could be good.
2667 2018-10-24 18:52:20 Legal in Canada know many who use the oil for pain
2668 2018-10-24 18:52:08 If @lngcanada can get the Gas to Kitimat we should be able to get the oil there as well. #northerngateway
2669 2018-10-24 18:52:08 If Shell is held accountable for oil spills in the delta, who will be held responsible for Kpo-fire or shell is doing that one too? By the way, Shell has divested nearly all their JV's in the delta, very soon you will have your fellow Nigerians to worry about.

2674 2018-10-24 18:51:39 I’ll never forget the time Carmen came to AutoZone and I checked her oil. She was 3 quarts low and her car only held 4 1/2 quarts
2675 2018-10-24 18:51:28 Oil is not really cheap. So why this all time low on many oil and gas equities? There must be a big structural shift in financial parameters.

2681 2018-10-24 18:50:11 Canada is Carbon neutral! We have 24 odd coal plants, China and India are building around 700 new ones! We are importing Saudis oil by tanker? Shipping ours by rail at a discount to be refined , buying it back?  We need a carbon tax? Did you eat paint chips as a child? Seriously?

2684 2018-10-24 18:50:07 Agreed -- this is throwing a stone and breaking a window. Exxon can settle this, or fight this -- it'll add up to some amount of cash paid to New York and to Exxon shareholders. Really no relevance to oil dependence at all.
2685 2018-10-24 18:50:06 Grapes and raisins are a no-go! Xylitol (sweetener), 
avocado, coffee & tea, and macadamia nuts are off limits, too.  

Also, no Tea Tree oil and be careful with other essential oils.

2687 2018-10-24 18:49:48 Coloradoans want clean air and water for their children and their children's children, and so on.

You apparently cannot see past the end of your nose. You cannot drink oil or money. You cannot breathe profits.
2688 2018-10-24 18:49:32 Your nonsense and posturing has lead to this. You probably don't mean it - as just a snake oil salesman....but the drivel and factional posturing has resulted in this. Loser!

2692 2018-10-24 18:48:51 yet don't believe that we could run out of oil...

2698 2018-10-24 18:48:26 I don’t think you actually understand how North Sea oil works. It’s technically *not* oor oil. It belongs to those granted exploration and extraction licenses.

As my memory serves me... You get what you plant. 
I would like to say you can get rid of oil from Saudi but not $ invested in largest economy of the world.

2701 2018-10-24 18:48:06 Nah get back on that bucatini horse. Throw some sun-dried tomatoes (with the oil) in a pan with artichoke hearts, anchovies, mushrooms, red pepper flakes, and garlic. Cook it and then throw that cooked bucatini in there so the liquid can settle in the middle.

2705 2018-10-24 18:47:53 my mama usually takes it for me I've never actually went and gotten an oil change by myself
2706 2018-10-24 18:47:49 Does it really make any difference? Name one country who will stop buying Saudi oil as a result?

2708 2018-10-24 18:47:25 Chef Kawasaki cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some  human flesh, along with sushi.
2709 2018-10-24 18:47:22 Strictly speaking your policy on palm oil is no good to me as I am dreadfully allergic to all palm oil and its derivatives
2710 2018-10-24 18:47:20 Mine knots up too, always untangles when I oil it up. Try oiling up regularly, it will get better or easy to untangle.
2711 2018-10-24 18:47:17 That's because the majority of Americans aren't rich, though ironically enough many of the same people had the currency to purchase the snake oil Trump was–and continues–to sell.
2712 2018-10-24 18:47:10 What’s your solution. Continuing to complain? That doesn’t get our oil to market. Something thought you supported?
2713 2018-10-24 18:46:57 I’ve been using skincare products w/ hemp seed oil for about 5-6 days now and all my acne has cleared up, my skin tone is more even, and some of my acne scars are fading 
2714 2018-10-24 18:46:57 i rub her down in oil.
2715 2018-10-24 18:46:42 Bush didn't declare martial law and rule indefinitely while pretending to seek out the 9/11 perpetrators because his goal was to enact the PNAC oil pact developed by his peers. Whereas Trump's goal is to become an oligarch like the Russian ones, but in Florida.
2716 2018-10-24 18:46:37 He sabi fry well ma worry, he will add enough oil to the rusty down there
2717 2018-10-24 18:46:12 The oil companies line is they only hedge for NZD rises. Allegedly
2718 2018-10-24 18:46:01 @kalkacult I made the oil you tweeted about. Let’s see if it works 
2719 2018-10-24 18:45:57 i didn’t know that when you went to get an oil change, they will clean out ur car & I’ve never been so embarrassed. I would’ve cleaned it out before if I had known 
2720 2018-10-24 18:45:45 #Confession I’m a sucker for tattoos, dreadlocks, and coconut oil glazed legs
2721 2018-10-24 18:45:42 And you ran a hedge fund for oil and gas, but now that you are rich you are on the climate warming train. Fn hypocrite
2722 2018-10-24 18:45:37 Really disappointed to see #palmoil in @GuPuds. That’s the last one I buy as we try to go palm oil free. Time to make the change to an alternative that doesn’t cause such awful deforestation and loss of habitat. Sustainable palm oil is available.
2723 2018-10-24 18:45:32 WW1 was about oil. The Berlin-Baghdad railrout. 20 year ceasefire, then it continued with WW2. That’s why the best generals were sent to the Middle East (Rommel, Montgomery etc). And schools still teach the Archduke Ferdinand bollocks.
2724 2018-10-24 18:45:31 I fed all my berries to gyms and then got this task. To say the least, I was pissed. I ended up using half of my golden razz to complete the task, thankfully I had a stock oil.
2725 2018-10-24 18:45:28 38 years of Independence and we still celebrate kutenga cooking oil from South Africa.
2726 2018-10-24 18:45:18 Yes but only when you make the stew with engine oil .. 
2727 2018-10-24 18:45:15 Store your olive oil in a dry place, outside of sunlight. Oxidized olive oil is very dangerous. #VAfitness
2728 2018-10-24 18:45:15 Hmm it's an oil isn't it might work in a w/o but I've never added oil into a formed o/w ?

2736 2018-10-24 18:43:39 Auntie Pro Cooking Tip:

When making Kale, be sure to use Olive Oil in the pan. That way, it will slip easily into the trash can.
2737 2018-10-24 18:43:21 I need a hot oil massage 
2738 2018-10-24 18:43:19 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
2739 2018-10-24 18:43:16 @WWERomanReigns Read on the Internet about turmeric, apricot kernel oil, flax seeds, hemp oil. I know that they help to clean the blood to remove a different type of tumor and also fight cancer. Plus vegetarian food will help you, support you.
2740 2018-10-24 18:43:11 Kuwait was stealing Iraqi oil with a diagonal pipe. (And partitioned by - guess who?) And his complaints fell on deaf international ears. Etc.1991.

2742 2018-10-24 18:43:08 Plastic is a polymer made by humans in a lab or factory. It’s usually made from the carbon in oil or natural gas, but it can be made from other natural products like wood fibers or banana peels!
2743 2018-10-24 18:43:05 That’s where the fight is, not the current corrupt One Party(two squabbling siblings) system, wholly bought and owned by Big Money Lobbyists, Wall St., Banking, Big Oil, Big Defense. If you’re not doing anything to promote #RankedChoiceVoting, then you’re not politically engaged.

2745 2018-10-24 18:42:59 Price went up 70-90% because of the oil embargo

2749 2018-10-24 18:42:41 Just because we want change does not mean we are trying to attack you and your family who depend on oil. Why not open your mind to the vast alternatives. I mean howcome my grandparents get to live to 90 but I can't? Why is a dollar worth more than a life?

2752 2018-10-24 18:42:34 Libya held a rare oil conference in the eastern city of Benghazi on Wednesday as its state oil firm NOC reached out to a region home to a parallel government backing a rival oil firm.
2753 2018-10-24 18:42:32 We wouldn't have had to worry about Saudi Arbia's oil threats because we were on a path to renewable energy dominance with China being our main competition.

2762 2018-10-24 18:41:33 I forgot to put my bio silk oil in my hair.
2763 2018-10-24 18:41:20 Which essential oil to get rid of the crippling depression?
2764 2018-10-24 18:41:19 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
2765 2018-10-24 18:41:18 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2766 2018-10-24 18:41:17 It’s honestly trial and error. Cantu products and coconut oil didn’t work for me. Good old water and Jamaican castor oil did the trick for my hair.
2767 2018-10-24 18:41:14 We have this bullshit advertising of snake oil in New Zealand where preceding your wildest made-up claims with ‘supports’ gives you impunity.  ‘Supports healthy liver function’, ‘supports body’s cancer-fighting process’ etc.
2768 2018-10-24 18:41:07  Pizza topped with extra-virgin olive oil, bean sprouts, fresh chopped parsley, and pineapple.
2769 2018-10-24 18:41:06 Are you within earshot? Ask ‘em how they feel about ingesting oil. Hot topic among vegans! 
2770 2018-10-24 18:40:58 I don't know what the debate on gas tax is but I think if you added a .25 tax on each gallon of oil and devoted it to the national debt it would help. Trouble is the money would need to be be scrutinized and guarded so carefully noone could access but like two people
2771 2018-10-24 18:40:55 Sunset and early moon in full on oil painting mode on the way home tonight. Wish I had a camera and a way of using it while driving!
2772 2018-10-24 18:40:50 I like the idea of strands, but my method for years has been to put shredded potato into a medium hot iron pan with about 3T oil and cover for 5 minutes or so then flip and finish uncovered. It works great and makes a crispy crust.

2777 2018-10-24 18:40:12 you dont use any oil right?
2778 2018-10-24 18:40:06 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
2779 2018-10-24 18:40:04 Heard about this oil leak two days ago... leaking since 2004? What else could go wrong? #ItUsedToBeCoolToBeGreen.
2780 2018-10-24 18:40:02 Shit we practically lost to a bunch of dudes in caves for some oil... but yeah it’s what we “believe”
2781 2018-10-24 18:39:52 Is there an app that lets me pay somebody to go get my oil changed?
2782 2018-10-24 18:39:50 The reaction should be: Build Energy East, stop bringing in Saudi Oil. That's a $2 billion/yr penalty to the Saudis and supports Canadian jobs, investment and taxes. This is fucking no brainer. But like u said, if there's a worse option, Trudeau will pick it
2783 2018-10-24 18:39:45 I asked my mama to oil my scalp and this lady said “no” ... I said “okay ima run away then “
2784 2018-10-24 18:39:38 Seems like a lot of trouble for what is in Olive oil
2785 2018-10-24 18:39:37 approve of the twist vs. olives. I hate how olive brine makes the drink look like it has an oil slick on it
2786 2018-10-24 18:39:34 US is giving deltans clean water to drink amidst the crude oil sales allocation.. A failed state.
2787 2018-10-24 18:39:30 So excited in a few mins i get to. See the all new episode of motm i cant wait to see if demon is back had to help mom put oil in her car :)

2791 2018-10-24 18:39:09 Why add pepperoni when you have Genoa salami?? And Mayo is good, but the true Italian hoagie has just oil and vinegar
2792 2018-10-24 18:39:04 #Oil prices jumped nearly 2% on Wednesday after data showing unexpectedly high consumption of U.S. gasoline and diesel last week threw a lifeline to a market battered by a near-5% selloff in the previous session.
2793 2018-10-24 18:38:46 I think it is because of demand of oil. Exchange rate is also a factor.
Can the rich sacrifice not to use their fuel inefficient cars?
2794 2018-10-24 18:38:46 Agreed. So many squeaky wheels getting oil right now. It’s disgusting on the part of all extremes. I don’t believe Trump is unhappy with the chaos however, as this plays right into his long term plan of national division.
2795 2018-10-24 18:38:37 Who paid for Pence to attend Hamilton in 2016? (Unclear)

Who paid for Pence to object to kneeling at Colts game in 2017 stunt? (Big Oil donor who like a Trump-Pence policies)
2796 2018-10-24 18:38:36 Crude Oil Price Outlook: WTI Breakdown Testing Initial Support: Crude has plummeted more than 13% off the monthly high with price responding to initial support. These are the targets & invalidation levels that matter on the WTI charts.
2797 2018-10-24 18:38:35 Oh, that's perfect! I already use almond oil to remove my makeup anyway! The other color I bought is called "Ruler," so we'll see how that works tomorrow. :) I didn't see any testers at the Target I went to, but maybe because I was in a rush and wasn't looking hard enough. :P

2800 2018-10-24 18:38:12 Not ricin. Castor oil seeds. Inform yourself.
2801 2018-10-24 18:38:05 Oil refinery’s in pk from Saudia is great agreement. Well done IK
2802 2018-10-24 18:38:05 I believe our state will still make it legal. everything trump stands for our gov does not. so its great oil drilling won't happen due to whales. and net nurt. we passed things last yr to keep us safe.
2803 2018-10-24 18:38:04 ね。自分もやばたにえん…
2804 2018-10-24 18:37:59 My mom used to slice very thin circles, (but not mandolin thin), soak for a bit, dry for a bit, then cook in a shallow pan in oil without stirring, flip the whole thing when golden. I called them “stuck together potatoes”.

2807 2018-10-24 18:37:44 I'd like to say, 'Send him down. No need to rush him like the Oil have done to so many players in the past', and I'd really try to argue that more if Sekera were around, but honestly, he's played well and I kinda feel that we need him due to limited NHL-ready Defensive depth
2808 2018-10-24 18:37:43 I don’t know.... I get my oil changed every three months and have AAA if I have a flat tire  but it was my starter & radiator is leaking 
2809 2018-10-24 18:37:42 This time okay na yung pag inom lang ng efficascent oil hehe, maya ulit iba naman
2810 2018-10-24 18:37:41 As for how long before you get one? Look at it this way. Long enough to hit it big through one heavy duty contract with: 
1. A bank
2. A Property dealer
3. An Oil company but the third one is very very very hard to get sha...
And voilà you can get House+Lexus all join.
2811 2018-10-24 18:37:33 A vote for Democrats is a vote for morals and for people who care about the whole United States just not the 1%. Clean air, Fair taxes, saving our national parks from oil drilling. Don't be lazy get out and vote it's more important and anything else you do this year.
2812 2018-10-24 18:37:25 Suaudi is powerful oil so is not possible to impose sanction against case Jamaal khashukhi
2813 2018-10-24 18:37:15 I really recommend that you invest $20-$30 for an essential oil diffuser, and get a 10 or 12 pack of different oils to use in your home. They fill your space with such a clean, beautiful aroma, and they really have an effect on your mind. Calming you down and lifting your mood.
2814 2018-10-24 18:37:13 You’re the type of liberal idiot to have a utopian view of the world, easy to say when you’re not in the Oval Office. Yeah let’s abandon Saudi Arabia, where do you get your oil from moron? Let’s not sell them military equip, hurt our economy and help Russia sell them theirs.
2815 2018-10-24 18:37:13 Another product I find vaguely helpful that has some clinical evidence is IBgard, basically very fancy peppermint oil that only gets released in your small intestine and helps with inflammation. Not exactly cheap, like $30 for 48. Might help if patreon weren't being so crappy.
2816 2018-10-24 18:37:04 Katchauuu tcin tcin I'M A TURKISH BREAD WITH SESAME OIL!!!!!
2817 2018-10-24 18:37:03 It’s really not. 
Glycerine dries my hair. 
Coconut oil leaves it looking greasy but without moisturization or nourishment. 
And the treatment that seems to work unfortunately costs more than R150.
2818 2018-10-24 18:37:00 Lalit Bhai, dollar and oil prices are not in his control. Mostly countries like us need a leader who can manage and create strong perception and image to have voice in this competitive world. We will have this issue but his leadership has vision, belief and commitment to India.
2819 2018-10-24 18:37:00 Hola una pregunta?? Al usarlo con weed oil el humo que sale tiene el mismo olor de un porro??
2820 2018-10-24 18:36:55 So the banks and ATMs in Zaria have also been affected due to Kaduna's 24hour curfew. When oil stains one finger, the other fingers get stained too!

2822 2018-10-24 18:36:52 Too little and 3 yrs too late. We need to see some URGENCY! Eliminate oil subsidies as promised & put $ into renewables, EVs. How about methane regulations? Kill KM expansion? UN says Canada is way behind doing its share! #FossilFree #climatechange #cdnpoli

2824 2018-10-24 18:36:22 #SaudiArabia has more oil & appears more supportive of #US ambitions. ‘Appears’ being central to our thesis that favors #Saudi but reality is far less certain in that regard.
2825 2018-10-24 18:36:10 Tresemme Moisture Rich is forever on special at Clicks. I've seen online dischem too. Olive oil from the grocery store. Shea butter from the health shop. Peppermint oil too. Shampoo from clicks or grocery store. Just look for sulphate free.

2830 2018-10-24 18:35:27 Based on the effects they have on the body and mind, and the incredible aroma, I think I found my favorite essential oil blend so far. Bergamot, cinnamon, and ylang-ylang. #aromatherapy #essentialoils
2831 2018-10-24 18:35:16 Tara Webber on BNN reports that 22% of Albertans are debt-free versus 26% for Canada. Many are carrying lots of debt over mortgage. I say, highest per-capita incomes, lowest provincial taxes, highest household debt. The lessons of the last oil downturn were lost. #cdnpoli #abpoli
2832 2018-10-24 18:35:01 Oil price action?
2833 2018-10-24 18:34:56 Coconut oil. Multi purpose substance. One should always have a jar in the cupboard
2834 2018-10-24 18:34:51 My endocrinologist says no to coconut oil ,  only olive oil or avocado oil
2835 2018-10-24 18:34:47 Stop all oil drilling flaring. NOW. Capture and use or Capture and give LNG away to poor.

2838 2018-10-24 18:34:40 Yes! We’ve got this bottle of olive oil we bought for €20-odd in Spain and drizzle that over at the end for extra collesterrol. Parmesan is a must too. Don’t over salt the sauce either cos I pile a load of that on.
2839 2018-10-24 18:34:38 The detective gazed at the people, they were the color of recycled aluminium draped in motor oil.

2843 2018-10-24 18:34:19 Answer: hella difficult. Hahah Oil cleanser works best. Didn’t have too much of a problem getting it off. But some of the darker colors do stain a little.  (My fav shades so far are Driver and Amazonian) I loooove how well they last through meals and stuff.
2844 2018-10-24 18:34:11 Still a long way to go before I reach my ideal weight but ADD OIL ADD OIL ME 
2845 2018-10-24 18:34:02 the mechanic i took my car to today for an oil change told me to just have jared replace my brakes and water pump and rotate my tires because "it's just too darn expensive and the discount i can give you won't do much" mad respect out here boys

2849 2018-10-24 18:33:28 Is coconut oil good for the skin?  

I've been using it and black Jamaican castor oil for my hair and they're doing wonders
2850 2018-10-24 18:33:02 After 18th Amendment, the province s are allowed to establish own companies and carry out exploration of oil and gas, mineral exploitation/ development in  own province n other provinces even overseas.This will create substantial business activities and employment opportunities

2856 2018-10-24 18:32:45 Nothing amazing..correlates with high oil prices..remember the years are all lagging data. We didn't do anything special just the commodity price was high and it fell...
2857 2018-10-24 18:32:44 deal with California oil industry and don’t worry about our oil sands.
2858 2018-10-24 18:32:40 Interesting, so you'e going to keep sucking up oil in Guyana, for zero benefit to the general population (only the corrupt people you're dealing with will have full pockets), whilst using this a smoke screen. Smart marketing team you have.
2859 2018-10-24 18:32:34 It’s vodka and CBD oil
2860 2018-10-24 18:32:29 No point w pipeline to east. Energy East failed bc NO one wanted to build a Refinery for AB Oil when its a dying industry.

2862 2018-10-24 18:32:18 Honestly idk why more people aren't obsessed with coconut oil like it does everything
2863 2018-10-24 18:32:15 anyone else get extreme anxiety when you’re getting an oil change and the mechanics guide you over the giant hole in the ground?
2864 2018-10-24 18:31:58 If only that was true.. men depend on the women to take car to get the oil changed and etc

2869 2018-10-24 18:31:23 Because shipping oil by rail is so much cleaner, safer, cost effective?

2877 2018-10-24 18:30:24 I think it’s best to look for alternative natural source than yapping about oil from Alberta all the time. Good on Ford government.
2878 2018-10-24 18:30:22 I always have the most random jobs and I hate when people ask me what I do. Like yeah alright I sell olive oil and children's toys ok I know it's weird.
2879 2018-10-24 18:30:07 Ohh big black pots to you Gary just remember all that oil and gas you mentioned in Indiref2 or will it disappear again like snow off a dyke
2880 2018-10-24 18:29:58 Omg queeen I need some new roship oil  that’s a NEEEED
2881 2018-10-24 18:29:57 I’m honestly looking at you sideways if you use anything other than olive oil and balsamic vinegar on your salad.

2885 2018-10-24 18:29:44 The simple solution to counter radical Islam is stop using diesel/petrol vehicles, why? As most of the world oil reserves lies in middle east and they promote radical Islam everywhere. So, use e-vehicles, once you attack their supply chain - you will win!

2896 2018-10-24 18:28:50 everytime i go get an oil change these guys try to tell me i need 50 other things fixed on my car.... like maybe i do, but keep that shit to yourself
2897 2018-10-24 18:28:46 How many rail cars derailed last week carrying oil, it is a secret I think as theCBC doesn’t want to tell us
2898 2018-10-24 18:28:36 We have had an oil rig off Louisiana that has been dumping 800 barrels of oil each day since 2004?

2903 2018-10-24 18:28:00 I need to wash out this oil treatment.
2904 2018-10-24 18:27:52 WW1 I would argue shares the blame equally amongst the antagonists in teh conflict (all).  WW2 would not have happened had we not entered into WW1...however it did happen and Germany started it, but we instigated to a degree Japan's attack on us via embargos of oil, etc.

2909 2018-10-24 18:27:45 Maybe not but after Iraqi war us oil production increased.. then there was Libya  now Syria.. do you see any trend.. its fishy don't you think...
2910 2018-10-24 18:27:44 Um, the left has plenty of blame for this. Every time a NeverTrumper criticizes tRUmp about a million and one lefties pile on saying, "but you supported the Iraq War," "the Bush Tax Cuts," or "big oil," etc. 

The left has not been welcoming to NeverTrumpers.

2918 2018-10-24 18:26:30 Recipe just says let sit for 30 mins but I figured longer was better. Then rolled thin and brushed with oil, baked in hot oven for 5-7 mins, added toppings and baked till crust brown and cheese melted. Really simple, lovely stretchy dough and good crunch when baked.

2921 2018-10-24 18:26:25 The $350 billion arms deal over ten years Saudis have signed up for alone will create 5 million jobs paying $70,000 each.

2931 2018-10-24 18:25:42 Most of the oil we generate is entirely unsuitable for plastic (and/or other uses) so the % is even lower

2935 2018-10-24 18:25:29 Short answer is no. Same reason he won't let Canada East Line succeed, he'll lose seats in Quebec. Even though the refinery down East could replace the 80 K blls of Saudi oil with Alberta's if it went through. Trudeau & Butts aren't about Canada

2936 2018-10-24 18:25:16 Big oil sells fossil fuel.  If Exxon or British Petroleum developed a new line of solar panels and promoted their sale, we would not demonize them for continuing to sell oil.  Much.  If a junk food company developed a new line of HEALTHY food...

2939 2018-10-24 18:24:46 My preferred way to make crispy has browns: cube the taters and toss in olive oil/salt. Put them in a bowl and microwave them (covered w/plastic wrap w/vent hole in top) for 6 min ,then immediately deep fry them until golden. They are crispy and delicious.
2940 2018-10-24 18:24:39 No idea on weights as I used a cup but roughly 1:1 starter and plain flour (depends on hydration level of starter, I used c.1.5 cups each) mixed with 1tbsp olive oil & 1tsp salt, kneaded for 5-10 mins till it felt smooth, left in oiled bowl covered w damp cloth for 2-3 hrs.

2948 2018-10-24 18:23:47 We need to stop giving oil companies subsidies.
2949 2018-10-24 18:23:46 Absolutely. I wouldn’t have minded the burning sage, crystals, peppermint oil, etc. if it had been in addition to medical care instead of in place of. I’m doing so much better now that I know what’s wrong with me! And I still love crystals, even if they’re medicinally useless!

2956 2018-10-24 18:23:01 well you should just Jamaican black castor oil and mix it with coconut oil Bc it's really thick and just massage it on your scalp. like minimum 3x a week. it grew out a bald spot and my hair grew like 2 inches in a month
2957 2018-10-24 18:22:56 Put some cling film over a cup, push it down to make a pouch pour a little olive oil in , put in spices, maybe some grated cheese, crack the egg into the cup, pull all 4 corners out and twist the ends so the egg is sealed, drop into boiling water for 5 minutes and bang ..

2977 2018-10-24 18:21:39 Without the oil and gas of the Middle East, the world economy goes flat. So we all desperately need the Arabs. It's simplistic to think the world's greatest economy/ military superpower can stay out of this age old conflict. Economic & geopolitical interests are simply too high.
2978 2018-10-24 18:21:24 The Delegations of the United States, Algeria, Nigeria, Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, Romania, and Tunisie demand excessive exports of oil. They have conducted several raids over the resource. Libya must work together as one nation to solve this!

2988 2018-10-24 18:20:15 I first called when I was on the road and the oil light went off. I was told "Maybe it's going off because you need an oil change". Seriously. Next time it was in for oil change, they pretty much blew it off. Said mouse droppings would necessitate "sanitizing" ... 1/2
2989 2018-10-24 18:20:03 The Premier is meeting with over 1,000 of Alberta's nurses. Just as she meets with teachers, Chambers of Commerce, oil and gas companies. Its what a Premier is supposed to do. She doesn't however promise legislation in exchange for cash like @jkenney

2991 2018-10-24 18:20:02 It’s actually really simple. The secret is left over rice & sesame oil (plus your aromatics, of course).

2993 2018-10-24 18:19:34 Sage could help :P but it's going to take a lot more than oil to heal what has been perpetrated on your family and people. I wish I had better magic. But I keep using what I got.
2994 2018-10-24 18:19:32 Used prescribed CBD oil from strain specific for ME and FM pain. It did nothing for the pain. It did trigger bad headaches within 15 minutes and within an hour or two significantly reduced cognitive and physical ability so that I was bed bound. Started at the lowest dose.

3002 2018-10-24 18:18:45 Apparently in Farmington Illinois Lozier Oil doesn't care if their employees harrass people. I wouldn't do business with them.

3013 2018-10-24 18:18:03 Ignorant arrogant needing someone else to blame.

3033 2018-10-24 18:15:54 @AlbertaatNoon I think we need to be clear about the difference between a tax and a levy. This isn’t a tax on individuals but on carbon. We know these “taxes” work and do decrease emissions. Why would AB shy away from that if we can make our oil and gas industry more palatable?

Put the shreds into a colander over a bowl and microwave them for a bit to remove some of the moisture and prevent browning. Then toss with your oil/salt/pepper and cook them in a waffle iron.

3069 2018-10-24 18:12:50 Nobody in, or remotely associated with, the US shale oil industry wants to see this sort of data. Their jobs are totally dependent on the LTO industry's ability to borrow, or defer more debt, their future based entirely on more low interest credit. It should be very scary.

3109 2018-10-24 18:08:14 Why does every member of the Trump cabinet seem to revel in doing the Exact Opposite of the job they are supposed to be doing? - the Department of the Interior is supposed to be protecting our land not helping energy companies to exploit it and ruin it with oil spills.

3115 2018-10-24 18:07:45 Just found out there's an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that's been spilling out 72,408 gallons of oil per day sense 2004 and has been gradually increasing, pretty damn disturbing.
3116 2018-10-24 18:07:42 oil ya scalp! lol

3118 2018-10-24 18:07:40 Ininom ko yung nabasag na efficascent oil sa wallet ko, mamamatay na ba ko??
3119 2018-10-24 18:07:40 It’sa really bad move by Saudi’s , only way to get out of this situation is to act wisely and soberly. It’s just a tester to pressurise them on oil prices and to prolong yemen war sake of weapons. #JamalKhashoggi

3122 2018-10-24 18:07:27 Wheat Board gone= oil being transported by train? Wow
3123 2018-10-24 18:07:18 I ain’t going near no oil
3124 2018-10-24 18:07:15 any recommendation for a good ((affordable)) oil scrub and shower oil?
3125 2018-10-24 18:07:13 Wow! What a cover up master to trap the officials and get the deal . 
It is going to become now Rough oil but not Rafael.
3126 2018-10-24 18:07:13 Rosehip oil udh abis sebotol dan.... efeknya ada sih tapi cuma di beberapa titik aja kemudian mencoba evoo di muka kok luvvv 
3127 2018-10-24 18:07:11 nous dans nos villages au moment de voter les européens on reste chez nous le gas oil coute cher pour aller angraisser tous ces pourris profiteurs qu'ils ne pensent cas que refaire un mandat que le pognon et les avantages
3128 2018-10-24 18:07:08 Now that I think about it, I have never taken any of my cars to get an oil change, brakes, tires, etc. lol
3129 2018-10-24 18:07:07 つおい…
3130 2018-10-24 18:07:04 You need to start taking Boots cod liver oil and glucosamine tablets.

Ideal for joint care.
3131 2018-10-24 18:07:03 Today I’m having a Matti car day. My white fox is getting an oil change some new wiper blades and a good ole clean. She’s lovin me. I treat her so well
3132 2018-10-24 18:07:00 #AbinaDisc #HIST125008F18 I think the slave owners were important because they produced palm oil which Britain was able to tax and gain revenue from which was greatly needed due to the war they just finished fighting, so they did not want to upset these slave owners
3133 2018-10-24 18:06:41 The guys at the car store where you get oil changes told me that I put 30,000 miles on my car in a year oops
3134 2018-10-24 18:06:35 @andreajenkyns how did your meeting go? #1922Committee 
Just get real- being PM is a tough tough gig, it’s like steering an oil tanker with a paddle, it’s not possible to be as bold and unrealistic as you are about brexit. As a country we have responsibilities.
3135 2018-10-24 18:06:32 The deep oil sands under the southern tier will probably be tapped in the next 50 years too. We will find more fuel to hotbox ourselves to death I'm sure.
3136 2018-10-24 18:06:28 @KlasraRauf Sometimes it's better to do a bit more research. You were comparing utilization of deferred oil facility in 1998 with that of today. Oil was 18 USD/barrel then & 68 now. Our oil consumption now has increased manifolds. Going to IMF for a SCF has many advantages for us
3137 2018-10-24 18:06:18 que buenos drivers se ven en oil, gas, litio, energias alternativas, campo, ganaderia, mineria, vitivinicola y frutihorticola se ve en Argentina. lo mejor en 30 años. Y que pesimistas los analistas del corto plazo. Es hora de darle al pico y la pala.

3139 2018-10-24 18:06:06 Remember when tobacco companies fought tooth & nail in the public eye and in the courts, stating tobacco was good for you, then it changed to it wasn't bad for you & it turns out that they were all full of shit? Well same thing will happen with Oil/Gas/Petro, but much worse.
3140 2018-10-24 18:05:58 BTW Obama called insurance Agent "Snake Oil Salesman".. . He was pandering to AARP in a small setting.  BUT it was recorded.  Not Violent! but a direct attack on a Small Business category's income capabilities. Cost the industry Millions.
3141 2018-10-24 18:05:55 queria ajudar
3142 2018-10-24 18:05:53 Not sure he's delusional. People have fears and opinions for reasons. I think it's more a case of a snake oil salesman has offered an easy answer to a complicated problem.

#HIST125008F18 
Slavery was illegal at that time. The men needed palm oil to keep the slavery. The person needed to trade.
3144 2018-10-24 18:05:48 Students burnt midnight oil  for success in exams and examiners changed their work into wild goose chase. Unacceptable.

3148 2018-10-24 18:05:15 Vraag dat maar aan die mensen die oil besluiten om Iran sancties tege te gaan en handelsreizen naar Iran te regelen.
3149 2018-10-24 18:05:10 How much are your oil changes?
3150 2018-10-24 18:05:07 Guy calm down, its not that deep
3151 2018-10-24 18:05:00 Finally got my oil changed, my life is together, the stars r aligned, I’m de-stressed 
3152 2018-10-24 18:04:59 Peanut oil costs more than water 
3153 2018-10-24 18:04:47 We used to get huge bricks of that government cheese. It didn't melt. Oil just pooled on the surface when you heated it.
3154 2018-10-24 18:04:37 That's a great idea. I'd love to have access to the CBD oil... it'll make it here eventually. Lol
3155 2018-10-24 18:04:36 This man will do no such thing.  He wants to increase military spending to “defend our constitution”   aka oil and central banks
3156 2018-10-24 18:04:23 I know I said this before but it really pisses me off the Chinese store charges more to steam my shrimp and broccoli whether than getting it cooked in peanut oil
3157 2018-10-24 18:04:21 The #carbonTAX is not enough, we should instead take the power from the oil and gas capitalists and transform the oil and gas economy into a democraticly planned economy with the goal of reducing immisons to below what the UN is asking for.
3158 2018-10-24 18:04:19 Oh that's good! If any start to appear, crack on with organic rosehip oil! Oh thanks luvvie!!
3159 2018-10-24 18:04:07 baileys car was supposed to get an oil change MONTHS ago & literally the only reason she got it changed today was so she & vic can come see me tomorrow night 
3160 2018-10-24 18:04:01 i would gladly pay for snake oil instead of that album
3161 2018-10-24 18:03:54 You don use brake oil before??  heaven!!!
3162 2018-10-24 18:03:51 Saudi oil has greases American politicians for generations why else did Saudi not suffer for it was their people who flew into the twin towers.
3163 2018-10-24 18:03:33 I dump a bag of pre shredded in my panini press & in no time I'm in crispy crunchy heaven. No oil even needed
3164 2018-10-24 18:03:21 Check your oil cap you can put Castrol I stop taking my 328i to the stealership

6 1/4 - 6 3/4 cups of all purpose flour
1/4 oz. of active dry yeast
1 tbsp. of oil
2 tbsp. of salt
3 tbsp. of sugar 
2 1/4 cups of water mixed and baked at 375 degrees for 30-35 minutes, or until golden brown.
3166 2018-10-24 18:03:15 oh biore ada mineral oil
3167 2018-10-24 18:03:14 Jeez your cringe is top class. Yeah fine we will trade oil/ whisky/ food/ energy etc in sea shells - would still see more benefit than we currently do anyway.

3171 2018-10-24 18:03:04 It was not that costly. It costed around Rs. 800 (not the high end type). I bought it with the daily allowance given by a big Oil company (ZadCo) that had called me to Abudhabi for an interview.
I did not take up the job as  Gulf war (USA vs Iraq) was looming.

3176 2018-10-24 18:02:41 i enjoy oil +pantyhose +anal
3177 2018-10-24 18:02:29 They gave me these antibiotics to hopefully dissolve it internally but imma have to get some tea tree oil!!
3178 2018-10-24 18:02:29 By our calculation @AuspiceCapital in 2017, Canada lost $9 billion per year from the discount in Canadian oil. But it was a $14 discount then. It is now $40 to $50 and that is now a loss of $25 to $30 billion per year.
3179 2018-10-24 18:02:17 i have my coupon to the receptionist at checkout (i’m getting my oil changed) and she got so huffy and annoyed with me. ma’am pls i’m poor stop making me feel bad about it

3183 2018-10-24 18:02:04 Rosemary and Olive Oil sound like a couple of spinsters who live with 10 cats.
3184 2018-10-24 18:01:58 You should not be in a position to not have the resources to get oil.  The resources to get oil exists.  They don't have to be denied to anyone by anyone if mankind needs it to survive.  The sole control of those resources were a result of force or violence, not volunteerism
3185 2018-10-24 18:01:53 zach and i have such an exciting week ahead! tomorrow i have an eye appt to see if i need glasses or not. friday i have an oil change/inspection for my car and then later that day we’re doing a photoshoot...
3186 2018-10-24 18:01:51 any type of oil makes my hair look straggly lmao 
3187 2018-10-24 18:01:48 It’s funny watching you talk about lying while you lie in such a preposterous manner.

When do you liberate yourself and stop lying for your Oil & Gas overlords?
3188 2018-10-24 18:01:46 Oil in their car then I would suggest an Ender 3 or a TiVo Flash or a geeetech A10 all are perfectly good printers for Budget beginners who have at least some basic handyman skills
3189 2018-10-24 18:01:40 If the KSA had never struck oil, they’d have spent the last 75 yrs living much more like their poor neighbor Yemen than France.  Also, despite their unimaginable oil wealth, the KSA has failed to diversify their economy & still rely heavily on oil exports to fund their economy.

3192 2018-10-24 18:01:28 If you do end up trying it, we have seen that pups respond best to something called decarboxylated CBD oil.

Hope it will help your furry friend!
3193 2018-10-24 18:01:25 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however revisit them.
3194 2018-10-24 18:01:20 Well I have a BMW n I get German oil put in it so yup 120 but it lasts for 12,000 miles

3196 2018-10-24 18:01:13 Install home water filter (no more bottled water)

Put deposit on liquid containers (in Denmark hobos collect plastic bottles so they can return it $)

Make plastic out of hemp resins, seed starches, not oil

Use paper/textile bags

Oil?
What oil?
There's no oil.......
3199 2018-10-24 18:00:50 Not asking the correct questions. Arms (military equipment) , oil industry, cyber security...
 There is a pattern to follow and its obvious
3200 2018-10-24 18:00:47 Gaby noooooo. I love you, I truly do. You’re an inspiration but the oil?? The oil??? What if your engine blew (which has happened to me and there’s no coming back from that)
3201 2018-10-24 18:00:45 So Shaikh Abdul wahab's kingdom is willing to overcome fiscal deficit of Pakistan by giving $6 Billion as balance of payment and oil on credit to a mystic follower Baba Farid!  Irony!  #PMIKAddress
3202 2018-10-24 18:00:37 BIG OIL wants you to vote no on i1631 because they don't want fines for their carbon. If i1631 passes then BIG OIL will pass the fees onto the consumer rather than to fix things. Check the FACTS before you vote! If you do you'll vote YES ON i1631

3210 2018-10-24 17:59:50 John, we've got the receipts on the disinformation campaigns the oil industry cooked up in their 'Smoke and Fumes' committee. Also, your claim to authority is ridiculous, it's like an Enron secretary claiming nothing underhanded happened because she never saw it herself.
3211 2018-10-24 17:59:47 Let me know if you want to chat on the phone. I don't think low oil would keep a car from starting. It's unlikely that you ruined anything, but there might be something else going on
3212 2018-10-24 17:59:40 I found the argon oil one too! You just have to look at random beauty supply stores
3213 2018-10-24 17:59:35 Not surprised by this I said to my husband watch the oil cars expand.....quess safety is not a big concern.... this is so political world wide... Draining the swamp has to be or were all in for one hell of a ride....
3214 2018-10-24 17:59:21 "Smoke points" in oils in just a culinary term and does not refer to the damage of the actual fat. You can cook with olive oil just fine without it oxidizing.
3215 2018-10-24 17:59:20 Les grands groupes financiers ont aujourd'hui des budgets supérieurs à bien des Etats, ils entendent être des Etats hors-sol avec leurs propres règles.

3217 2018-10-24 17:59:03 No "one" does.  If I don't have the resources to get oil, and those who do are forced to give it to me, that requires a system of violent control to be in place.  You are asking for more government control.  You are asking for fewer people to have total control of resources.
3218 2018-10-24 17:59:02 Your opinion is a fact to me. My opinion is that, starting immediately, crazy-making oil companies must be removed from OUR wonderful planetary system.
3219 2018-10-24 17:58:59 Watch out because oil prices will tank, as well!!

3236 2018-10-24 17:56:54 Has anyone tried CBD oil for their pets? 

I’m thinking about getting some for our beagle. He has seizures, and the medicine we give him makes him irritable and, honestly, really unpleasant.

3241 2018-10-24 17:56:41 Obama is a snake oil salesman!  Loves his ego stroked and he actually did nothing for 8 years other than waste time and resources.  Most unqualified President, other than Carter, in my lifetime.  He’s a joke - but the joke went over the heads of the moronic liberal voters!
3242 2018-10-24 17:56:39 I know I shouldn’t complain cuz I’m getting my oil changed, but it just took 3 people at Valvoline to get my hood open, and I was the third one, and I opened the hood. RIP car, you had a good run.
3243 2018-10-24 17:56:25 Got it. Overfilled oil can be bad because if it gets up to the crankshaft it can be whipped into a froth and not lubricate correctly. However, it's very unlikely that you ruined anything driving a few miles

3249 2018-10-24 17:55:44 Welcome to the Lumity family. It’s so great to see that our oil has found its way onto your skincare essentials list!

3256 2018-10-24 17:54:30 U keep pushing this bad asset. A crypto not tied to sovereignty and an economy that can support its value is ripe for manipulation and highly volatile so just forget it cut ur losses and move to the new cryptos USD or settlement coins. This is snake oil pure and simple.

3262 2018-10-24 17:53:57 You don't get it, no one should be having the power to deny you oil if you need it.  The fact that someone controls the oils is NOT A RESULT of volunteerism.  It's a result of force.  In fact, it still goes on, wars, invasions, fighting... all to see who ends up with control /oil

I have no intent of convincing people on the internet.

Have a good day, back to stock market and crude oil price.
3272 2018-10-24 17:53:01 Actually, castor beans were sent to all of them. You could just as easily have said castor oil was sent to them.

3275 2018-10-24 17:52:46 cannabis oil has been proven to reduce tumours FACT so why not treat children with this plant that grows in the ground !!!!!
3276 2018-10-24 17:52:45 Ricky, what applies to Sadam, applies to the Saudis. Barbaric acts have consequences! Lol! Regime change? The oil is our currency. I can't argue with you there.
3277 2018-10-24 17:52:44 First we bought a $4.5-billion oil pipeline. Now there are suggestions Canadians, through the federal govt, should consider investing in rail cars and locomotives to get oil to market. I would come up with a better idea fut I dropped out of bible school.
3278 2018-10-24 17:52:41 You can deep fry with a pan of oil but its a little harder. Not something I'm personally used to.

3281 2018-10-24 17:52:31 Getting an oil change and I got my headphones in and this old man just talking my ear off. But it’s cool listening to his stories
3282 2018-10-24 17:52:24 Gotta change brake pads and oil soon

3283 2018-10-24 17:52:09 AND imagine backing down our dependency on foreign OIL as well..Freeing ourselves of the vice. There are multiple advantages across the board.
3284 2018-10-24 17:51:56 At Walmart and the guy doing my oil change is really hot and just walked up to me and caught me on tinder.

3289 2018-10-24 17:51:31 females get a car and don't check the oil, tire pressure, or coolant. As long as a MF start up and radio work she ready to roll 
3290 2018-10-24 17:51:22 There is great irony in your snake oil reference.  Such products were taken off store shelves by -- wait for it -- activist judges.  Prior, liability for such sales was restricted to the retailer, not the manufacturer. Politicians in thrall to those manufacturers were complicit.
3291 2018-10-24 17:51:18 For those who ordered massage oil samples and massage bars: we're waiting on a shipment of bottles and tubes so your orders may be delayed. Thank you for your patience!
3292 2018-10-24 17:51:09 Sounds weird but if you want it to grow mix egg honey and olive oil and let it sit in you hair for an hour ever two weeks . It makes your hair very healthy too!

The beard oil is working lol
3295 2018-10-24 17:50:55 If one person does not sell me oil, another will.  It benefits no one, particularly the one with oil, if they do not sell it to anyone.  The only means by which one entity can control all resources is through the agressive threat of government.  Not possible in free market.
3296 2018-10-24 17:50:47 Absolutely! I use synthetic blend so my oil changes are a little bit more expensive. My brother is an ASE certified mechanic but I moved to a different state so now I have to pay for oil changes. So I use Groupon and that same $90 oil change I get for $30
3297 2018-10-24 17:50:46 アークね（笑）
3298 2018-10-24 17:50:41 Yeah we just oil and water

3312 2018-10-24 17:49:11 Even hippies criticize 1631, doesnt go far ENOUGH.  Why tax things people need but exempt the biggest polluters (therefore revenue generators) for the tax?  Seems like it was written by big coal to hurt big oil at the expense of consumers.

3330 2018-10-24 17:47:08 You can't produce anything if the access to the resources are denied by entities who control, solely control, them.  You cannot get oil without the consent of the owner of that oil.  You cannot get land access without consent to the owner.  That control was not via volunteering.
3331 2018-10-24 17:46:57 Def add olive oil & tinned tomatoes... ?
3332 2018-10-24 17:46:52 Look, I try to eat healthy food, unprocessed when possible, avoid palm oil, don’t eat meat or eggs. Factory farming is deplorable. Even large scale grain farming is bad for the environment. But sense has to come in somewhere. You don’t starve a child.

3336 2018-10-24 17:46:23 Curious - did you check the oil level yourself after putting in the first quart? How about the second? It's possible that you overfilled it if there was still a few quarts left over in the pan. I'm still not sure why the car would not start, but maybe it's ok
3337 2018-10-24 17:46:22 Stupid it is not a charity. Stupid it is not an aid. The package is simply deferment of oil payments and nomination of Pakistani banks for Saudi deposits.

3340 2018-10-24 17:46:17 I made soup last night and managed to burn the olive oil and onions before I even did anything else, but then I did still use them so now my whole soup tastes like burning. In case anyone was wondering about my cooking skills
3341 2018-10-24 17:46:15 This is an example of regulatory over-reach.  Are Exxon’s investors (if they have IQ’s over 60) not aware that the oil industry is at risk from the changing mix of energy sources?  What do NY citizens gain from this?  Stop grandstanding.
3342 2018-10-24 17:45:57 I’ve not checked the oil since maybe January, as for the rest I’ve never checked that
3343 2018-10-24 17:45:50 Buy crude oil for tomorrow, looks like will touch 5100 again, cmp 4935
3344 2018-10-24 17:45:47 and thatll likely be the second major thing to trip you up. But yeah. Drain the gas at the end of the season, change the oil at the beginning. Do that, and you'll be doing better than 98% of people :P

3351 2018-10-24 17:45:19 The stick is no different than a protracted spike in oil prices - it inevitably results in consumer and business choices. For example, pushing people to drive less or buy more fuel efficient vehicles, or lower the thermostat one degree. It sharpens our focus about energy usage.
3352 2018-10-24 17:45:16 Oooh gotcha! I definitely felt that but the nurse said it probably burned so bad bc of the oil they put on you to help the baby come out..

3354 2018-10-24 17:45:13 Tanner is trusting me to drive his car alone, without him to go get his oil changed Friday... hell has froze over 
3355 2018-10-24 17:45:10 And so most of those oils are in most of the olive oils.  Yes even the extra virgin ones.  Yes even the ones labeled 100% olive oil.
3356 2018-10-24 17:45:07 Oil changes are also important though (though like I said, most people buy a mower, run it until it dies in 3-5 years, then buy a new one rather than do this...) 
But especially oil operating in cold environments. As it degrades, it wont be the proper viscosity for the conditions

Maybe it was the car's computer keepign you from starting it with low oil pressure. Mechanically it should have started
3383 2018-10-24 17:42:01 It’s time for an oil change!
3384 2018-10-24 17:41:56 lemme tell y’all a secret. 

orange essential oil. 
that shit’ll brighten up your mood asap no cap. like mix it w a lil lavender dilute in some water pour that shit in a spray bottle and go bout your day. you’re welcome.
3385 2018-10-24 17:41:43 my mum told me to not drop the oil and guess what I did. drop the feckin oil everywhere I’m dead

3387 2018-10-24 17:41:20 I think at this rate CBD oil will be the new fidget spinners
3388 2018-10-24 17:41:19 We've been here before when Oil, Steel & Railroad Barrons owned the government & treated workers like slaves. Newspapers were often propaganda rags that supported the Robber Barons.

Labor unions and people voting for Progressives like Teddy Roosevelt turned the tide. #VoteBlue

3390 2018-10-24 17:40:55 Because most food trends emerge from foods that aren't new (ie: cupcakes, cold pressed juices, olive oil in the 80's), but from something about those foods changing in narrative (cupcakes became Sexy via And The City, and suddenly they weren't just for kids anymore).
3391 2018-10-24 17:40:51  Yep. While you have -200,000 overdue for an oil change

3393 2018-10-24 17:40:35 As you know, “worthy” has nothing to do with it.  Gory made-for-TV crime,  skillfully dramatized by Erdogan.  Victim a “journalist” for the WAPO. Saudis in the middle of everything: oil, the dollar, Islamic terror, Israel, Iran, etc. Yemen who?
3394 2018-10-24 17:40:33 Quick lube and oil change in Watson. I had a head light out and they didn’t say anything. They just did tests on my engine or whatever to see if any lights were on I guess
3395 2018-10-24 17:40:29 I actually see the opposite. The left is far more welcoming of differences of opinion, which is why conservatives' demands for, essentially, affirmative action in academia/the media are so effective. Where are your tears for a liberal in the military or at an oil company?
3396 2018-10-24 17:40:29 ....Wouldn't be the same place where we are buying millions of barrels of oil from on a daily basis, would it?
Not the same place that kills women and gays yet we happily buy from daily, not that place?
Not the same place that isn't held to the same standard as  Energy sector?

3398 2018-10-24 17:40:22 Sounds like mechanic that did your oil change is trying to cover their ass. Lack of oil won't generally keep a car from starting. It will just destroy the engine when it's not lubricated. There's no way a car has too much oil if you put 2 quarts into a dry engine. They hold 4-5

3402 2018-10-24 17:40:04 “I didn’t know there was corded product in there. I thought it was just essential oils.” FOR $50 YOU THOUGHT THERE WAS 4 TINY ASS BOTTLES OF ESSENTIAL OIL. NO YOU CUNT. THERE WAS A FUCKING ELECTRIC IN THERE AND NOW THAT LADY WHO TOOK IT OFF OUR SHELF CAN GET $50 for no reason.
3403 2018-10-24 17:40:03 You can count all you want but what evidence can you show me that there is still 400 years of oil in Scottish waters, go on nows your chance to prove a "yoon" wrong.
3404 2018-10-24 17:40:00 @shadowtaps to @TheDemocrats Florida’s worst polluters are backing Ron DeSantis. It seems like he won’t hold the accountable for threatening our way of life. He wants to expand oil drilling in national wildlife refuges. Remember, #VOTEBLUE
3405 2018-10-24 17:39:47 USELESS! Checking oil is like checking if a cake done, that simple. And most too lazy to do that

3407 2018-10-24 17:39:40 Heating can be gas, oil, or electric systems, which means heating experts are trained and experienced in how to repair, maintain, and install all three system types. They even know how to work with electrical circuitry, so you can count on them to fix your problems.

3411 2018-10-24 17:39:21 I’ve also heard double frying is necessary for crispiness. Refried potatoes. I’m on a bit of a homemade hash browns tear myself. Was presoaking in salty water. Now—grate yellow potato and put straight into skillet w hot peanut oil +bit o’butter & s+p
3412 2018-10-24 17:39:09 IMHO; What we are seeing in the UK esp. London is a prelude tho what I've tweeted, after all, it will become a civil war of attrition with young migrants who know how to fight a war! Oil and water can never mix nor assimilate-Sweden is lost, Germany, and France is on it's way TY!
3413 2018-10-24 17:39:02 Why would you replace butter? It’s heart healthy compared to 90% of its “replacements.” Avocado oil is my shit tho
3414 2018-10-24 17:39:02 Love the scent of this oil 
3415 2018-10-24 17:38:27 coconut oil makes everything better
3416 2018-10-24 17:38:26 The oil flows from the top to the bottom, how long must Americans put up with this “nationalist” who continues to motivate and cultivate hatred. Thank God for the media! This office is becoming so stained with his ass in it. Will someone plz let him know we will not be terrorized
3417 2018-10-24 17:38:21 McDonalds' secret to crispy golden fries is also to double fry in oil -- the intermediate freeze stage (how they're stored in transit / at the restaurant) creates good crystals to get a fluffy interior but you're in good company with the par-fry.  Any tips on which oil to use?

3427 2018-10-24 17:37:13 Royal Dutch Shell have announced that their jointly owned P-69 floating storage and offloading vessel in the Brazilian Santos Basin has started oil production.

3433 2018-10-24 17:36:32 I literally hate coming to get my oil changed
3434 2018-10-24 17:36:29 Wait...I have so many more things to blame on Bouwmeester. Did you know he is partially responsible for the Arab oil embargo from the 70's and he canceled Star Trek?

3439 2018-10-24 17:35:38 I wouldn’t show you the pictures ; too disturbing , the House of Saud  are barbaric all stems stems from Wahabbaim. Invade and take the oil perhaps.  I have an intrinsic dislike of them - was brought up in the Yemen.

3450 2018-10-24 17:34:36 Definitely all covered in the documentation. I change the oil at the start of the season, and I always run mine dry of gas everytime I use it, I don't get as much snow as when I lived in new england.
3451 2018-10-24 17:34:36 That's simple. We just remove the rent portions from those products at their sources (timber, mines, & oil wells)
3452 2018-10-24 17:34:32 Nigeria has no record of its oil, non-oil export activities since Buhari and APC took over governance in June 2015.

3458 2018-10-24 17:33:44 I doubt lithium makers can maintain a short supply well or for long.
You (a) need too little of it to make good batteries, (b) don't burn it up in using it as you do oil, and (c) there are too many other economic sources of lithium available to build a cartel.
3459 2018-10-24 17:33:36 Awesome! Except for the canola oil.
3460 2018-10-24 17:33:36 Tell me more about this red oil exportation, I am interested
3461 2018-10-24 17:33:25 What does a currency connected to oil got to do with socialism? It was capitalism that failed.
3462 2018-10-24 17:33:25 Tell me exactly what “good” solution is being outlawed?
Obamacare outlawed “junk” insurance policies because they weren’t even worth the postage they were mailed in.  Why do you think “snake oil” was outlawed a very long time ago?
3463 2018-10-24 17:33:19 Maybe you've already tried this but I know some people that swear by CBD oil for anxiety and physical pain, and it definitely doesn't leave you inebriated in any way.

I feel you deeply with this thread though and I'm grateful you put it out there, it's been on my mind as well.
3464 2018-10-24 17:33:06 Y esto es grcs a la buena ejecuciòn de las regalias del oil. espero que se reconozca que bien manejado la industria extractiva deja beneficios. @petrogustavo esto no hubiera sido posible sin ecopetrol.
3465 2018-10-24 17:32:56 Seriously, how do people get oil changes without a domestic partner who has another car?
3466 2018-10-24 17:32:54 Even the forecast does not favour Buhari.
The headline only holds true if we're mindful with our debt management and reduce our reliance on oil.
Meanwhile we're not doing well with the 2 conditions set above.

3482 2018-10-24 17:31:25 We also stopped Iraq from invading Kuwait & taking control of their government. Iraq’s plan was to take over all surrounding countries of Saudi Arabia & then strike until they inevitably surrender giving them control of all oil fields in the Middle East.

3486 2018-10-24 17:30:45 right. But not the likely route. Bullion acquired by colonialism pegged $£ high by creating a scarcity within colonised. Dropped when they realised oil could buy ALL the world's gold. And break the system. petro£ will die. digital  will replace it. Hft  terrorists thrive.
3487 2018-10-24 17:30:45 Really is fascinating that @SiobhanCoadyNL couldn't clearly articulate the output based allocation GHG scheme that will apply to offshore oil. Coady stumbled through the answer with bit and pieces of the plan and sentence fragments.

3506 2018-10-24 17:29:16 Suggested this many months ago. The 3 provinces could partner with 1st nations to build a pipeline from Edmonton, thru Lloyd to Churchill. A large tank farm could store oil during the months when the port is iced up.

3518 2018-10-24 17:27:29 If they want our money then buy USA oil or let Russia fund them see how that works
3519 2018-10-24 17:27:18 How would you pay for it? With the money you’re hiding that’s being collected from the big doners? Like oil companies that hate any regulations? Piss off ok?

3527 2018-10-24 17:26:06 No shit, CO produces 3x more energy than it consumes. The revenue from the oil we ship out is what funds our schools and police/fire departments
3528 2018-10-24 17:26:05 Data churning can always be made to look like as desired - cherry picked. Would like to see Oil cost/Petroleum Tax revenue neutralised FD, CAD and Inflation data for last 10 years

3541 2018-10-24 17:25:00 CBD oil has been better than ANY pharma I’ve tried, no side effects, non addictive and very inexpensive to make yourself. Be cautious of pharmaceutical promotions like this. #cannabissaveslives
3542 2018-10-24 17:24:51 Unknown source oil, it all comes from Scottish waters apart from a few percent, goes to Europe but is allocated to England as GDP. Swaying the Barnett formula somewhat. How much stamp duty balances £34 billion?
3543 2018-10-24 17:24:48 Everyone actually responding with oil recommendations, what do you suggest for fear, anxiety, hatred, and murderous righteous rage. Asking for a trans American.

3547 2018-10-24 17:24:16 i think most SNP voters are well aware of how well the republic is doing, but Scotland is constantly told we will be Europe's only 3 world nation if we left the UK. . . . If only we had oil, gas, or a thriving banking centre . . .but alas
3548 2018-10-24 17:24:10 This man told me it wasn’t go take long for to get my oil changed  my break only an hour nigga ain’t even on my car
3549 2018-10-24 17:24:08 But it still doesn’t explain why Canada has bought a 65 year old oil pipeline & committed to expanding #tarsands development to fill a $8 billion pipeline no oil business would touch?

3560 2018-10-24 17:22:29 One of the oldest political insults is: 'snake oil salesman'.

The original 'snake oil salesman' was named Clark Stanley who boiled snakes alive in public to attract customers, then brewed the scum from the top of the cauldron into a panacea. It didn't work.

3563 2018-10-24 17:22:16 Capitalism is a materialistic doctrine.  The result of a few owning the resources of the earth WAS NOT VIA VOLUNTEERISM.  It was done by nothing outside of force. Someone owning the oil, controlling it, is not a result of the people volunteering for that.  That was force.
3564 2018-10-24 17:22:16 Brakes oil & tires lol das it though
3565 2018-10-24 17:22:14 compare it to oil price
3566 2018-10-24 17:22:10 Or the Oil coulda took Tkachuk with the 4 pick and problem solved.  There was a reason the Blue Jackets passed on JP in the 3 spot, they knew there was better players to pick.  Flames got the guy they wanted.
3567 2018-10-24 17:22:09 Don’t forget doing make up in the car and “I can’t remember the last time I changed the oil” or “i think the check engine light is on” but it’s the maintenance light lol. Get customers like this all the time
3568 2018-10-24 17:22:05 Norway is a tiny oil rich country. It has no leverage whatsoever.

3587 2018-10-24 17:20:15 So sad ... Your country — the country that helped us here out of nazism and kept Stalin’s ambitions at bay — is sliding further down the rabbit hole. This is a Breitbart engineered dystopia turning people against one another while Big Oil keeps polluting and cashing in.

3593 2018-10-24 17:19:52 Argh.  Let’s make it even more ridiculous : 

Ottawa buys the oil at world market price, transports by newly acquired rail or nationalized pipe and pumps it into salt caverns in Ontario or Quebec. 

Start new oil industry in central Canada.

All it costs us is our sanity.

3595 2018-10-24 17:19:50 And they followed the materialist doctrine, more of the machines and people to get more oil, with such a view no progress is made,only increased consumption. What's needed is more and better technology, that requires more non-apparent investment and R&D.

3625 2018-10-24 17:16:36 Whats our obsession with cooking oil smh
3626 2018-10-24 17:16:32 Agreed, that was why the idea of using existing oil boiler to top up till so retrofit. No idea how feasible that is though.
3627 2018-10-24 17:16:26 That is possibly a great suggestion. Bitumen pellets are being investigated by the U of C for commercial viability. If that happens, rail is ideal for transport, although one wouldn't need as many locomotives as currently in use to transport oil.

I threw in ginger paste and sesame oil, but then I added some Serrano peppers for heat and some fire grilled chicken for body and a little crumbled garlic toast garnish for texture. Now it’s a different soup altogether.
3659 2018-10-24 17:12:55 Well my coconut oil still over there so I’ll be over soon
3660 2018-10-24 17:12:44 With the old Maybot gangnam styling her way to the front of the room no doubt. What a fucking shower of snake oil salesmen.
3661 2018-10-24 17:12:39 Get some strong peppermint oil and put it in a bowl with steaming hot water and then just hang above it for a few minutes. It should help a lot
3662 2018-10-24 17:12:38 I have become so obsessed with essential oils that when people tell me that there is something wrong with them I instantly think “I bet there is an oil for that”. Then spend hours researching it 
3663 2018-10-24 17:12:30 Sir  oil to mahnaga ho hi Rahi hai Magar sir kuchh  Delhi ke pollution Ko lekar kijie. Please
3664 2018-10-24 17:12:28 the logic behind 1999 constitution is to institutionalize fiscal corruption and sharing oil money period
3665 2018-10-24 17:12:15 Lol!!! Daddy you got your oil and water!!! Lol!!!!
3666 2018-10-24 17:12:14 Tell her she needs an oil change... 
3667 2018-10-24 17:12:09 Both individuals are graduates . The man came from a well to do home that dint invest well and hence lost all their wealth. His dad owned the compound tho .
 Nigga was working in one of those fancy oil and gas while serving ( he ghosted ) he had a nasty attitude and got caught
3668 2018-10-24 17:12:03 Your party sold our sovereign nation to the troika and IMF and sold our fisheries and oil and gas for peanuts . Go away . Fianna Fáil Traitors .
3669 2018-10-24 17:12:00 This sounds truly fascinating! Having just spent some there, I’m curious how Norway, with their large oil resources, fare in this regard ( #corruption ) given the Nordic Model within which they operate.
3670 2018-10-24 17:11:57 I think the IT valuation issue spreads beyond HC/life science (see Tesla). Hopefully the market regains some discipline and corrects. Otherwise, I fear that investment in sound HC/life science innovation will dry up and we’ll be stuck with fax machines and snake oil.
3671 2018-10-24 17:11:49 No blood for oil, on that note no blood for air, no blood for water. Sorry but that’s reality welcome to the 21st century
3672 2018-10-24 17:11:47 Wait, @KoinangeJeff to interview S.Sudan President? This is a must Watch, Jeff avoid some questions we need you back home , ask quiz like do they refine their oil. @citizentvkenya @xtiandela #JKLive
3673 2018-10-24 17:11:45 In the waiting room for an oil change, watching cable news for the first time in months. It's real dumb.
3674 2018-10-24 17:11:36 I have puffy eyes from genetics. But I will also try that almond oil. Thank you
3675 2018-10-24 17:11:34 Do they do MOTs too, or just oil filter changes?
3676 2018-10-24 17:11:29 I live with all that darkness, i feel for you, i will tell you what has helped me, 400 mgs. of magnesium, morning and evening, it quiets your mind and gives you deeper sleep... Probiotics help too, make your digestion perform efficiently.. CBD oil is helpful as well, costly tho.
3677 2018-10-24 17:11:23 You may borrow from Saudi Arabia but they never lend money on same terms what IMF or WB will negotiate.
Saudi charging interest to Pakistani loans remains doubtful because they are depositing 3 Bil USD in Pakistani account for a year. 3 yrs of oil on deferred payments is trade.
3678 2018-10-24 17:11:23 omgg well it looks so good girl!  keep doing what you do! ima have to try out fish oil 
3679 2018-10-24 17:11:20 If not for oil this country would have been bombed by their biggest/closest ally..and would have looked somewhat like Iraq  Libya  Syria  or a rogue state like Pakistan . Scumbags.
3680 2018-10-24 17:11:18 Several months later and I still can't believe @denzelcurry said:

"Then expect the royal treatment
Talkin' slick like it's oil speakin'
Down to earth, 'til my soil weaken
Venomous words, watching the poison leak in"

That shit is  wtf
3681 2018-10-24 17:11:14 And an alliance with a government that needs *far* less competition in oil and gas.

And which has *already* set you up for the takedown.

US alliance? Gone.

Who blew up what?
Houthis, Qataris, Iranians, ISIS... Anyone but Russia, *clearly!*

Other allies: Rinse and Repeat.
3682 2018-10-24 17:11:12 Newsflash, we haven't been a "super power" in years! Ever since Bush, Jr and his fellow Republicans *LIED* about Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction and dragging us into another war for oil. Geez! Follow them dots, dude!
3683 2018-10-24 17:11:09 Does anyone know if Castor Oil actually works for hair growth?? 
3684 2018-10-24 17:11:03 Of course. So is the cost of farming it too much for farmers and oil producers or something?
3685 2018-10-24 17:11:03 ah yes the lovely midday sun shining directly on my stove highlighting all of the oil splatters
3686 2018-10-24 17:11:01 I love my oil diffuser
3687 2018-10-24 17:10:57 #WednesdayWisdom I always do 1 part rice 2 parts boiling water, bit of butter (or olive oil) and salt YUM! #rice #JamieOliver
3688 2018-10-24 17:10:51 Do a hot oil treatment, the heat will open ur pores and hair strands allowing the oil to stay put. Then when u wash it’s important NOT to use hot water cause you’ll just reverse the hot oil treatment
3689 2018-10-24 17:10:47 I always tell my students who come to my course to cook #healthy #curry using less salt and vegetable oil etc ! Using substitutes for cream is low-fat yoghurt or coconut cream for vegans !#NationalCurryWeek #nhs
3690 2018-10-24 17:10:47 So a freeze trap but with oil? Sigh
3691 2018-10-24 17:10:38 STV news there saying Scotland has loads of oil left, but because it’s Scottish it’s nae really worth anything.
3692 2018-10-24 17:10:32 And?
The oil and its profits belong to the people of Venezuela, not to banks.
3693 2018-10-24 17:10:26 Banger and oil soup go dey with starch
3694 2018-10-24 17:10:24 เสื้อเต็มตู้ แต่กูไม่มีเสื้อผ้าใส่ 55555 มันจริงนะว้อยยย
3695 2018-10-24 17:10:18 Do daily facial massages. Get an organic cream like those from Avalon. Prob almond oil at night.
3696 2018-10-24 17:10:16 Big money exchanged hands and special oil concessions
3697 2018-10-24 17:10:07 Ham and onions sautéed in butter and olive oil in my dream last night. Does this mean I want to cook and eat the 5-0?
3698 2018-10-24 17:10:06 I don’t use any conditioner at all ever because all it does is weigh my hair down and I only wash once a week usually. With Moroccan oil. Once and a while I condition if I’m styling my hair but I barely ever do that I just let it be natural 
3699 2018-10-24 17:10:05 Pretty sure you def need someone to hold your helmet for this one! I know someone! 
3700 2018-10-24 17:10:05 プールとか入るとよくわからないけど凄まじい勢いで浮くよ。
3701 2018-10-24 17:10:04 It seems like I will just marry a tiv or an igbo girl(no offence). All I have to do is buy tubers of yam,kolanut and palm oil. Shikenan 
Marriage na marriage ai
3702 2018-10-24 17:10:03 Females get a car and don't check the oil, tire pressure, or coolant. As long as a MF start up and radio work she ready to roll ....
3703 2018-10-24 17:10:03 Bout to go home and pick up some oil mascerati, food, and cover myself with vicks. Cause fall already wrecked me before winter could even try.
3704 2018-10-24 17:10:00 Change your oil every 3000 miles.
3705 2018-10-24 17:10:00 I know the skin struggle it’s so hard. For dryness I’m finding it’s working keeping it really basic. @LushLtd olive soap to wash, then evening primrose oil and @origins drink up intensive every so often... xx
3706 2018-10-24 17:09:55 Perdón por la consulta...que símbolo tiene el OIL en tradingview? Gracias!
3707 2018-10-24 17:09:46 ｿﾝﾅｺﾄﾜﾅｲﾃﾞｽ…‥…………(^ー^)
3708 2018-10-24 17:09:44 I would do some research on total cost of ownership: ei. what do tires for it cost? does it have odd size wheels that need special tires? does it need special filters for oil or air? Then take a peak of recalls on those models over the last couple years.
3709 2018-10-24 17:09:37 Come do my oil changes since you a mechanic mechanic.
3710 2018-10-24 17:09:35 I would use it to change oil
3711 2018-10-24 17:09:32 Yes, come to dock warehouse at midnight. Please oil yourself before and wear a loose robe for easy chest access. Also, bring a blindfold. It gets a little kinky.
3712 2018-10-24 17:09:15 The only thing I want out of life is happiness!  I am officially there! Happy, Minding my business and Building my business. Hempworx- CBD Oil is a life saver. Ask me how you can become an affiliate
3713 2018-10-24 17:09:00 Lol I once told a daughter of an overprotective man that her dad has skeleton in his cupboard
3714 2018-10-24 17:08:52 You a grown ass man and cant change oil, breaks or a tire you aren’t a man my guy 
3715 2018-10-24 17:08:50 #Oilandgas $OIH $XLE are acting as if oil is headed much lower and staying there. Things are truly atrocious here that are entirely decoupled from actual business inside the companies. They are in their own bear markets above and beyond general market pessimism.
3716 2018-10-24 17:08:45 Dont mind them o stew means obe prepared with ingredients like tomato onion veg oil maggi and plenty pepper as a yoruba boy lol
3717 2018-10-24 17:08:45 milk cleanser ya milk cleanser, cleansing oil ya cleansing oil itu beda jenis tp gunanya sama, sama sama cleanser, pake salah satu aja []
3718 2018-10-24 17:08:38 Either way we need to get past oil and gas sooner rather than later.
3719 2018-10-24 17:08:37 That regulation focuses on fuel oil quality and reporting of non availability of compliant FO "including enhancement of the GISIS module for data collection and analysis". #IMO2020 (GISIS is the IMO datapoint and reporting to was described as "unsatisfactory" for other things
3720 2018-10-24 17:08:36 It happens when anyone take honey or Olive Oil. Don't take it seriously 
3721 2018-10-24 17:08:33 There are dozens and dozens of sports fans that wish they had a job like yours. Congratulations Jack and thanks for being in Oil Country!
3722 2018-10-24 17:08:30 i was working in that industry in that era and this is a re-write of history and a smear campaign. The big oil companies were pro-occupied with two things, peak oil and getting lead out of gasoline without ruining car engines in the process.
3723 2018-10-24 17:08:25 It's an idea promoted by Patrick Moore, ex-Greenpeace guy turned oil shill. Since he said 97% of scientists are wrong, I asked him about vaccines and GMOs. Naturally, he blocked me.
3724 2018-10-24 17:08:14 I agree with @ThiqqSznAllSzn that maybe another reason British was reluctant to enforce it, besides politically, was because they were so invested in their palm oil plantations they didnt want to risk losing money #AbinaDisc #HIST125007F18
3725 2018-10-24 17:08:12 Rosehip oil, laneige clear c advanced effector
3726 2018-10-24 17:08:06 Is this a smirk or is this a smirk ! 

#Benghazi, the #Barqah region being depleted/robbed of its oil resources for the #corruption in #Tripoli
3727 2018-10-24 17:08:06 yeah i made the tweet about m2 mains chugging motor oil and apparently that warranted a follow
3728 2018-10-24 17:08:00 Rail cars are cheap, twining the entirety of both CN and CP lines is what is required by both oil and grain shippers. I would support a federal government plan to twin the rail lines.
3729 2018-10-24 17:07:56 I'm so uncomfortable watching that. I'm uncomfy and sicky, why would anyone want to do this? One bite and it kills you in a cluster fuck of oil and flavours. You'll be having diarrhoea while in the grave
3730 2018-10-24 17:07:36 I’m getting my oil changed so I’m chillen back here @baiy_ruger was suppose to save me but I guess she fell off the face of the earth.
3731 2018-10-24 17:07:20 Sell you snake oil to Trump U suckers. We’re not buying.
3732 2018-10-24 17:07:20 I highly recommend the cellsentials from @USANAinc in addition to a good fish oil to suppport heart and brain health.  What are you looking for in a vitamin?
3733 2018-10-24 17:07:18 I put baby oil on my scalp last night and now my hair is forever oily, at least it’s soft
3734 2018-10-24 17:07:16 Maybe I told Angel... Anyways, coconut oil and honey bitch. You will never feel healthier in your whole ass life. And no biggie, I move it between the kitchen and my bathroom all the time
3735 2018-10-24 17:07:10 The beef the US has with Venezuela is that Venezuela told US OIL entities TO FUCK OFF; that the oil of Venezuela is NOT the oil of the US.  Since then, the US has embarked on campaign against them.  Mind you, I am an anarchist, i loath hierarchy governments of any kind.
3736 2018-10-24 17:07:07 Vitamin E oil is the truthhhhh 
3737 2018-10-24 17:07:03 Few days back they wrote an article about oil bonds repayment.
I asked you about this.
You don't reply 
3738 2018-10-24 17:07:03 Last time i checked you followed me i didn't follow you ??

3741 2018-10-24 17:06:41 So if it’s not an invasion, then what is it????? Thank you for your service however you weren’t the only one defending this country so it seems if it’s on foreign soil protecting oil killing is ok but not our own boarders.... Interesting how that works out....
3742 2018-10-24 17:06:38 its giant oil slick with  gross things trapped in it u sharing
3743 2018-10-24 17:06:37 I use coconut oil on mines ... && that still doesn’t work 
3744 2018-10-24 17:06:32 It was the oil industry that provided funds for the early tarmaced road network in the USA. Others copied. Few owners made fast journeys. Need limited car routes in city centres (1 Way?) Lots of human powered areas and good cheap public transport. Reroute not rebuild.
3745 2018-10-24 17:06:30 เราไม่อยากปล่อยมันไปอะ 
3746 2018-10-24 17:06:25 Turns out.... neither do I. And I have spent the last half hour trying to figure out why my car sounds like a hairdryer..... I have no oil or water  what is life
3747 2018-10-24 17:06:24 I don't know if anyone can answer this but why don't we produce cooking oil form sunflower seeds???
3748 2018-10-24 17:06:21 Who know a good place to get your oil changed?? Not no dealer cause I ain’t finna pay 200+.. fuhh that.
3749 2018-10-24 17:06:19 Wake up to a spoonful of fish oil
3750 2018-10-24 17:06:10 Exactly. North Sea oil and gas could see our #climate and our planet past the point of no return. #ClimateChangeIsReal

3754 2018-10-24 17:05:32 Come to Arizona. A massage with warm oil & cinnamon will take care of it
3755 2018-10-24 17:05:31 団長ありがとうございます
3756 2018-10-24 17:05:30 once you start shaving with coconut oil there's no going back
3757 2018-10-24 17:05:12 In response to David's question, I believe that the British did not fully enforce their ban on slavery was because the British empire was so invested into the palm oil plantations and knew a surplus of slaves were needed in order to run them #AbinaDisc #HIST125007F18
3758 2018-10-24 17:05:11 emissions from an oil refinery are reflected in a street puddle at dusk in texas.
3759 2018-10-24 17:05:11 Why do you need to oil your squirrel?
3760 2018-10-24 17:05:10 You’ve never said this once this was my own original idea also your coconut oil is in the kitchen now
3761 2018-10-24 17:05:08 That makes the flow results sound even more exciting.
3762 2018-10-24 17:05:03 I have a wax melter with a tea light but was considering getting another but didn't know if I should get a wax melter or an oil diffuser
3763 2018-10-24 17:04:59 Does anyone else get anxiety doing adult things? Such as an oil change??? Asking for a friend...
3764 2018-10-24 17:04:52 As a matter of fact I take care of the cars in my house! I’m sure my husband doesn’t even know you how to check your oil 
3765 2018-10-24 17:04:24 You for or against Beto?
You omitted this“almost $5 million has been spent running ads on President Donald Trump's main Facebook page, "Donald J. Trump."
&
“Also among the top spenders is the oil company Exxon Mobil, which has spent almost $2 million on ads on Facebook since May”
3766 2018-10-24 17:04:03 Fun fact I’ve literally never gotten an oil change for myself
3767 2018-10-24 17:04:03 Thanks CBD Oil! I haven’t won anything but it’s nice what you’re doing
3768 2018-10-24 17:03:48 How funny. That what I made yesterday. Celeriac, dried mushrooms and truffle oil.

3770 2018-10-24 17:03:34 I buy loads of dry skin special primers and now my skin is so oily you could get enough oil to fry something on it

3773 2018-10-24 17:03:20 Despite a slight oil recovery, equities are still plunging. SLB, SN, OAS, APA, CPG, HAL, PE....steeply in the red. Oil/equity ratio soaring which indicates steep financial troubles at the current oil price. Something steeply changes here and I think it is the decline rate. #OOTT

3775 2018-10-24 17:03:03 OK, Alberta is one of the two provinces leading in GDP growth. AB has significant problems from oil industry downturn. Nevertheless, the carbon tax is not throttling growth in AB.

3787 2018-10-24 17:01:57 Realistically, just follow the manual. It has every piece of planned maintenance laid out for you. Most dealerships also put the mileage you need your oil changed again on a sticker.
3788 2018-10-24 17:01:54 ...BABY OIL?!
3789 2018-10-24 17:01:49 It’s gone from DEFENDING & making excuses..

3793 2018-10-24 17:01:30 I think we need to take all the pigs & drop them into ocean as food for the water life of the ocean & let them go extinct. Some prophet implied we may need to do that. After that we start breeding all the animals that are not causing diseases & clean up the earth & stop using oil
3794 2018-10-24 17:01:24 Would be nice if we could take military out of the M.E., which, let's face it, is hopeless, and apply them instead to helping our southern neighbors have liveable homes.  But I've been puzzling over our failure to do so for decades.  Not enough oil in Honduras, etc.?

3797 2018-10-24 17:01:11 Will you compare the PEx across periods of a company where the largest biz has first been an oil biz, then an infra biz, then a consumer biz, then a financials biz? Making decisions based on index PEx and its std devs across periods is no different

3799 2018-10-24 17:00:53 Heard that Federal Bank of America can able to print as much currency(Dollars) as it needs..
Due to the immense demand to Dollars and Crude oil exchange that should be done only in Dollar.
Is that true?

3807 2018-10-24 17:00:31 Not everyone heats their house using fossil fuel. Many have already switched to electricity, not produced using fossil fuel, to protect the planet. Maybe your Stornoway mansion still has an oil or gaz furnace, but you don't have to worry since Canadians are paying that bill.

3813 2018-10-24 17:00:11 Not all businessmen are Trump-like. Trump is riding a populist wave and his narrative is based on ideas developed by people like Bannon. My point is someone with a business background and knowledge in the energy sector can greatly benefit the oil sector in Iraq...
3814 2018-10-24 17:00:00 I believe so! Might be a fun student inquiry: which particles best carry charge in a medium like oil?

3877 2018-10-24 16:52:23 Well let's be fair then. Give Canada a fair price for the oil we sell you and not a discounted price.
3878 2018-10-24 16:51:59 Actually I think it’s because we’re not used to that much oil in one plate of food. Cos since I knew about the meal in sec school the beans is always swimming in oil.

3888 2018-10-24 16:50:21 They are indeed intertwined, but as he personally explained to me before, the Ministry of Electricity has been a failure because the Ministry of Oil has not been cooperative and has been plagued with corruption. Obscene amounts of money have been stolen in the Min of Oil.

3890 2018-10-24 16:50:10 Opposition leaders in the Archipelagian Senate are now calling for a  ban on fish exports to Desicca and Boreala unless the suspected oil embargo is lifted.

3930 2018-10-24 16:46:24 Ties into oil too which makes me think devalue US dollar. So they become standard? Equifax keeps popping in my head. Still think China did that myself.
3931 2018-10-24 16:46:19 A friendly mood and loving attitude are as an oil which lubricates the wheel of life, making them move easily and smoothly.
3932 2018-10-24 16:46:18 Last time I looked we weren't holding the Saudi government responsible...that doesn't mean they weren't involved. Their very ideology makes them cupable. We tiptoe around Saudi because of their oil. They've had Trump in their pocket for years.
3933 2018-10-24 16:46:16 Sis! Lol that oil change. Your engine will appreciate it 
3934 2018-10-24 16:46:11 Check your Engine oil this morning.

3936 2018-10-24 16:45:59 i need a oil change
3937 2018-10-24 16:45:32 Well they will make money on 3 billion. oil sale for 3 years on the current rate,  plus interest on that, is a good deal for Saudia. It’s still a better deal than IMF for Pakistan. We might get little stain on our army once they will pulling out a fast one on yemini children.
3938 2018-10-24 16:45:26 Hey, I'm low on snake oil. Usual place, back of the garages. Yeah?
3939 2018-10-24 16:45:22 Double vodka and olive oil
3940 2018-10-24 16:45:15 I felt so happy walking outta Trader Joe’s with flower and coconut oil 
3941 2018-10-24 16:45:12 This is just one of many concerns among Archipelagian economists. The lack of oil is seriously slowing growth in the island nation. Some are now suspecting a covert plan by Desicca and other oil-exporting states to cut off oil supplies, artificially raising oil prices.
3942 2018-10-24 16:45:11 Pain relief ranks top among the several benefits of CBD for athletes. #CBD oil alleviates the triggers of pain in the body, which could be a result of bone and joint injury, muscle strain, post-surgery recovery, and several others. #engineeredforendurance
3943 2018-10-24 16:45:04 man my oil light n tire light just tryna slow me down i’m tryna go fast
3944 2018-10-24 16:45:03 why’s he drinking olive oil
3945 2018-10-24 16:45:02 Actually oil proces should be marginally decreased to give positive image and as a message of hope.from 93 rupees/litre ,it could be fixed at 90.
This will add credibility to the govt and other commodity prices will also remain low.
3946 2018-10-24 16:44:59 I’m honestly really surprised I’m not freaking about this bomb shit. God forbid I drop some oil. I think I’m life is over.
3947 2018-10-24 16:44:57 Amid wide outrage against killing of journalist #JamalKhashoggi, #Saudi Arabia announced it can supply more crude oil and that too quickly if need be ! 

Crude prices started to cool off !

3953 2018-10-24 16:44:32 Two hours for an oil change?!?! TWO FREAKING HOURS! @Walmart wassup?! Cause this is ridiculous! Thing is they still haven’t even touched my car! I was quoted for 30 mins to an hour!
3954 2018-10-24 16:44:27 Maybe Big Oil has already discovered how to harness Dark Energy & are suppressing this info to protect their profits. #BatShitConspracies
3955 2018-10-24 16:44:21 I somewhat agree with you on this. But $70 is still not great for oil. But if we hadn't had 40 years of conservative austerity and set up a trust fund instead, there would have been money available to stimulate the economy right now. So conservatives fucked up too
3956 2018-10-24 16:44:19 CBD oil in my coffee

3965 2018-10-24 16:43:12 BTVi carried a news item today,  quoting Govt Sources of OIL Buyback of about Rs. 1100 cr buyback. No announcement so far.
3966 2018-10-24 16:43:07 Great question, Kristin! While we don't have a blend specifically designed for asthma, you may find relief from our Immune and Allergy Release blends, and from diffusing the single note Eucalyptus oil. We also recommend checking in with a trusted health practitioner. 
3967 2018-10-24 16:43:06 I've been using essential oil before bed lately & literally get the best sleep. Magic
3968 2018-10-24 16:43:06 Coconut oil. We used it on everything at the commune.

3970 2018-10-24 16:42:48 We need to take a renewable energy bone saw to the Saudi Crown Prince’s oil empire torso & stuff it in a suitcase of climate stability

3972 2018-10-24 16:42:43 I heard the tame oregano oil is lousy lol
3973 2018-10-24 16:42:40 Been to Saudi and you couldn’t be more right..  the simple fact that we are now a net oil producer should mean we should no longer be beholden to them....
3974 2018-10-24 16:42:38 Clearly because of all the transparency on their oil field data.
3975 2018-10-24 16:42:36 who 'stole' the oil Jason?
3976 2018-10-24 16:42:35 Picked the right day for an oil change. Done in 30 minutes.

3986 2018-10-24 16:42:09 Big guns always get away with the impossible. If it was Iran or an African country sanctions will be flying  all over the place. Now the oil pond nation is in a very comfortable place. I hate this.
3987 2018-10-24 16:42:01 How does Duluth Trading Co in Wixom not have mock turtle necks out for sale?  Shocking.  I drove 30 mins to find out.  Who is dumbass that made this display/sales decision?  Clown. Joke. Moron. Never again.  @DuluthTradingCo

3992 2018-10-24 16:41:19 I have a tree of life locket necklace that I put lavender oil in, it somewhat helps me but not as much :(
3993 2018-10-24 16:41:17 It’s true . My grandma just got on me about that and told me when I have to get a oil change , how to check my tire pressure , and  told me to check my coolant .
3994 2018-10-24 16:41:05 I’ve heard you’re not supposed to heat olive oil for some reason. Yeah GMOs get a bad wrap, they’re not all bad. Coconut is good yeah
3995 2018-10-24 16:41:02 The oil might help some transition down.  Pot as pot is probably a mixed bag (the gateway effect is real, but it might be useful in a multi-pronged withdrawal strategy) but should be a net positive, while of course adding problems of its own.
3996 2018-10-24 16:40:57 Stop buying saudi oil they will learn the lesson being good IS good business
3997 2018-10-24 16:40:43 As an example of human scum I'm quite comfortable speaking loudly about oil sales in a quiet coffee shop.

4001 2018-10-24 16:40:22 most people realized early that they could clean themselves with other substances. oils were most common (not to mention better for the skin) Rome used Olive oil to bathe, rubbing it on the skin then scraping the skin to remove dead skin cells and dirt. I like coconut oil, myself
4002 2018-10-24 16:40:16 تبي شريحه كم قيقا؟ 
4003 2018-10-24 16:40:12 You can't blame international oil prices on the government.

Or the New Zealand dollar v US dollar level.
4004 2018-10-24 16:40:10 Oil is at 70 dollars. NDP and the Liberals did kill the economy. Our oil is selling for 20.

4007 2018-10-24 16:40:00 Atiku was in OBJ government wen our foreign debt was cleared with alot of economic reforms after coming out of Abacha looters n Buhari PTF scam. Foreign reserve grew to all time high of about $60b  wen price of oil was less than $30 per barrel
4008 2018-10-24 16:39:58 We been knew that I got mine on accident
4009 2018-10-24 16:39:58 US keeps them relevant even for Oil. If the day comes where Iran becomes their bud - unlikely - how relevant would they be? They can't even pump oil prices too high because shale oil becomes a more economical solution. They couldn't even pull off an IPO because they're too shady

4015 2018-10-24 16:39:03 Where have NL oil royalties gone? Why a NL deficit? 
A fund of Norway's oil royalties, by comparison, amount to more than $1trillion. Adjusting by a factor of ten create a potential NL fund worth $100 billion. At nominal interest rate of 3% would create $3B annually. 
So, wtf?
4016 2018-10-24 16:39:02 fuck work, why can't i just stay in bed all day  why can't i be a little prissy 8-5 office girl, but naahhh, i gotta be a nigga, and work graveyard shifts for the oil field lolfaccckk it, money talks, and my boys gotta eat! could never sit on my ass all day, gotta be movin!

4021 2018-10-24 16:38:54 @LaurenMah2 Great concept map. I think another factor that leads to a lack of healthy eating is cultural traditions. For instance, some cultures such as ones from south Asia have traditional common foods that are cooked in large amounts of oil. #EM203problems

4029 2018-10-24 16:38:30 @julieturkewitz Just wanted to say thanks for the well balanced article on the proposition to have oil wells be 2500 feet from homes/schools/etc. I'm against the proposition, in large part bc the testing and studies are working off of anecdotes rather than complete studies.

4031 2018-10-24 16:38:17 Ok and that's my point. All presidents are serving the corporate elites, but trump especially given that his administration is full of Wall Street bankers. As for Alberta, low oil prices have caused our slump. Only a simpleton would believe that the ndp could solely kill business
4032 2018-10-24 16:38:09 The French government allowed Total (the oil company) to settle in French Guiana to explore the offshore waters in search of oil, super close to a big biodiversity niche!

4034 2018-10-24 16:38:00 That is true, there are several factors why he invaded, firstly money, secondly rumaila oil field. However, he wouldnt of invaded if April Glaspie hadnt given him the green light. In regards to the water, i can top that and say the US provides iraq with over 3 billion in aid..

4038 2018-10-24 16:37:41 Could it be that toxic chemicals or substances are being dumped in the ocean killing sea life? This also happened a few years aback in Daytona Beach FL. And there was the BP oil spill that caused billions in damages. The toxicity might affect humans on the beaches too, who knows?

4040 2018-10-24 16:37:31 Mix both together and oil it everyday?
4041 2018-10-24 16:37:31 So Imran Khan did manage to secure $ from his friends, Saudi Arabia to begin with. With an upfront $3bn and upto $3bn deferred oil facility, total credit line is $6bn. However, the upfront $3bn is not up-for-use.
4042 2018-10-24 16:37:28 Yes!
Garnished with dryfish, vegetables, palm oil, ponmo, beef/goatmeat and enough pepper!

Wash down with one big Coke!
4043 2018-10-24 16:37:10 This was no doubt a pro PR piece for the oil industry.
4044 2018-10-24 16:37:08 Fair enough.  I can barely touch onions most days and celery is just yuck.
But I never had them when I was younger because my mom despised them.  But I've started making them roasted with salt, pepper, and olive oil.  To me, so good.
4045 2018-10-24 16:36:59 CBD oil is so awesome
4046 2018-10-24 16:36:54 We are going to impose sanctions on Iran on the eve of the election. Someone's trying to also make us sanction the Saudis, which is related to Iran being unable to sell their oil. Also, perhaps the caravan?
4047 2018-10-24 16:36:45 ههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههه  اسطورة يا ابو منصور.
4048 2018-10-24 16:36:45 Was this exaggeration? I am part of IT too the way things going on in India very few are happy with him. People are losing trust after dollar rates and oil prices.
4049 2018-10-24 16:36:35 No one is seriously saying that if we burn every drop of oil reserves we will be poisoned.  

They are warning that it will warm the planet & mess with reliable conveyors of heat...causing floods, droughts, fire and a billion+ refugees.  I know how you feel about that last one.
4050 2018-10-24 16:36:26 "Formula for success; rise early, work hard, strike oil" ~ J. Paul Getty
4051 2018-10-24 16:36:22 Madness. We will then pay the same (high) fixed price when the oil price drops again to $40's. Imagine the uproar then. Market driven price is not the problem, Government wasting our taxes is.
4052 2018-10-24 16:36:12 To all of those people who want to get rid of fossil fuels, I would like to hear your plan as to how you would replace all of the tax revenue generated by the oil sector? Which social programs would you cut because of a lack of funds?
4053 2018-10-24 16:36:10 Our CBD oil tastes like refreshing oranges, made with natural fruits 
4054 2018-10-24 16:36:04 LeSabre got low on oil. Light come on and she was tickin’ pretty good. Took damn near three quarts. Welp, there goes my gas money.
4055 2018-10-24 16:36:00 "Absolubtly. Remind me of the arrangement we had. We buy "x" amount of arms and continue to sell you oil and you let us do whatever the Fuck we want, right?"
4056 2018-10-24 16:35:50 Actually the United States has enough oil and Natural gas under our own land to last for roughly 100 years. maybe more. Many of these pockets of fuel are as of yet untapped

4067 2018-10-24 16:35:08 Wanted: a reporter who will actually check the math on this idea that having the potential to get oil to markets other than the US Gulf Coast will fetch a higher price. It's quoted as gospel these days but needs serious fact checking. #abpoli #cdnpoli #bcpoli #StopTMX
4068 2018-10-24 16:35:02 But there’s oil everywhere

4070 2018-10-24 16:34:47 Youthia Logic:

Imran takes $6 billion from Saudi; from November 2018 Pakistan will observe US embargo against Iranian oil. Yet, Pakistan is going to play a mediation role and convince Iran that they have their best interest in mind as they want an end to proxy wars in ME 
4071 2018-10-24 16:34:44 oh, those regulations you talk about are in place in order to 1) keep people safe (think West Texas explosion, oil pipeline leaks), 2) to protect US drinking water (you know, what we need to live).....

Now, lets get back you your free market talk
4072 2018-10-24 16:34:43 It's a great strategy.  One line plays over half the OT and is off the charts productive.  Other set/sets play other half with objective of holding neutral.  Oil OT results prove that it works. Your second sentence is the entire point.

4074 2018-10-24 16:34:33 Been using Smuckers natural peanut butter for a little over a year now. It satisfies my soul to see the peanut oil at the top when I opened the jar. Now, when I see other peanut butter, how thick it is, how there is no oil, it doesn’t move, I’m disgusted. It feels fake 
4075 2018-10-24 16:34:24 But the carbon tax on the oil in that pipeline will pay for it....
4076 2018-10-24 16:34:21 Lol no one will be using oil in 40 years let alone 400

Is heavenly. And healthy.

4082 2018-10-24 16:33:33 now, if you truly cared about free market then you would call for all oil and gas subsidies to be abolished.  or you would call for the same amount of subsidies to be given to 1) solar, 2) hydro, 3) nuclear, etc......Oil/Gas/Coal have been subsidized for over a century

4088 2018-10-24 16:32:42 Bullshit,  served with oil.
4089 2018-10-24 16:32:38 Federal Executive Council has approved a budget of N8.73tn for 2019 fiscal year. The price of oil is pegged at $60 per barrel, exchange rate at N305 to $1 and daily crude oil production at 2.3m barrels per day.

4090 2018-10-24 16:32:30 I put peppermint oil in my hair and it feels like God is blowing his breath on my scalp.
4091 2018-10-24 16:32:22 would frankincense and myrrh oil work? instead of using eucalyptus oil or mint oil.
4092 2018-10-24 16:32:14 Having written apps for several oil companies and also a gas station owner i must say that most of the oil conpanies are extremely slow on adıpting new tech due to their huge global operations. They have tons of precide customer data yet they still don’t use big data approaches
4093 2018-10-24 16:32:13 you heave seriously not answered my question.  1) Oil and Gas industries receive BILLIONS of dollars worth of subsidies from the US Govt.....2) that means they arent really in a free market.....
4094 2018-10-24 16:32:06 Finally getting an oil change
4095 2018-10-24 16:32:05 Just replace oil with drones for a satirical masterpiece.

4127 2018-10-24 16:28:57 The Oilers used to be one of my favorite teams to follow. I watched Oil Change online and loved Dubnyk, Hall, Eberle, Nugent-Hopkins, etc. All the Oilers from like several years ago. I was hoping they’d turn it around & stopped really paying attention to them until McDavid.
4128 2018-10-24 16:28:53 It doesn't make sense to compare data or information to resources like water or oil, says @rufuspollock. Why?

4136 2018-10-24 16:28:25 Now the big question is will China and India want to break sanctions hard? India is doing it without its private companies. The National Oil Companies have to be transparent and need to do purchases on tenders outside of term contracts. Will be difficult for them to push too high
4137 2018-10-24 16:28:18 I got it back on but my hands are now covered in oil. I am owning it - sharp looks and quick steps 
4138 2018-10-24 16:28:12 I know, but when The Times calls it a "fracking company" wealthy readers take note.

4147 2018-10-24 16:27:26 The timing is amazing. Trump's "won't last two weeks without US support" followed by MBS's "yes, but we paid you good money for all the weaponry and let's not forget the costs of oil" and then this story unfolds... 

You do the math.

4167 2018-10-24 16:24:39 The western powers have over a period of time killed millions of Muslims in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. Now they want to paralyze the whole Arab world. The only thing that is stopping them is the wealth of oil which they want for themselves. This Muslim massacre has to stop.
4168 2018-10-24 16:24:38 Again, MBS shows why he is not a leader to trust, nor deal with. The House of Saud is corrupt, made only worse by wealth. Without oil they have nothing to offer.

Use coconut oil as ur lotion. It makes your skin so soft and smooth until u get older.

4208 2018-10-24 16:19:40 Do you really want to vote to support someone who will lie to your face. Gop voters he is selling you snake oil. Be careful.
4209 2018-10-24 16:19:39 2. That result about 100 corporations being culpable for almost all emissions is misleading since what it is actually saying is that private persons and smaller corporations produce most of the emissions using products (oil, gas, petrol, etc) from Big Oil.

4211 2018-10-24 16:19:18 Just my thoughts: I feel Koshoggi murder was a pretext to put more pressure on KSA this gave the west they needed to put pressure on MBS over pumping more oil & his wreckless behavior around the world its was the calm before the storm now trump his going to milk saudi reserves
4212 2018-10-24 16:19:10 Oil of Oregano drops in some water. It smells horrific but it will clear that up.

4215 2018-10-24 16:18:56 The KSA has been hurting US interests for decades (e.g., the oil embargo of the 1970’s). More recently, the first Gulf War was fought by the US  ostensibly to “liberate” that democracy known as Kuwait but mainly to protect the KSA which, in turn, led to al Qaida’s rise & 9/11.
4216 2018-10-24 16:18:56 I’m getting an oil change at the dealers. The guy beside me is playing some game on his phone with the volume up full blast.  Turn the volume down. Geez

4218 2018-10-24 16:18:45 Some crude pricing context for $CPG, heading into Q3 financials. When factoring in currency arbitrage, WCS is down 13% from Q2, LSB down about 0.96% and Uinta Wax up about 1.04%. For estimating, oil production weighting is distributed 15% WCS, 60% LSB and 25% UW.
4219 2018-10-24 16:18:26 What’s oil ? asking for a friend .
4220 2018-10-24 16:18:23 Opening the bar of soap from atop the sink, he lathered it between his hands & stepped into the spray behind the Setite. "Here, let me," he said, soaping up Set's back & down his buttocks & legs. "Need to get the remnants of that body oil off you before you dress."
4221 2018-10-24 16:18:20 I make brown tea with Sri Lankan Cinnamon (the real stuff) then blend it with green tea powder, coconut oil, lemon juice and maca. It keeps me going most of the day.
4222 2018-10-24 16:18:20 There’s really no right time to tell your friend from home to shut the fuck up about her essential oil business enterprise.

4233 2018-10-24 16:17:00 Keeping your hair in a ponytail is by far the best hairstyle to avoid breakouts. Your hair contains excess amounts of oil & dirt. Keeping it far away from your face at all times is crucial.

4245 2018-10-24 16:15:58 That’s what the whole Khashoggi/Saudi Arabia thing was about - Deep State trying to force POTUS to severe ties = financial free fall if he had retaliated - oil prices through the roof - possible SA change to Russian or Chinese currency...
4246 2018-10-24 16:15:47 This is so cool, thank you! And whooo-weee that certainly does sound like some pretty magic oil...
4247 2018-10-24 16:15:40 My gf can change her own oil and tires, knows where and when to put coolant in, but still makes me do it for her while she sits in the car taking pics of me doing it

4249 2018-10-24 16:15:27 Bernstein: “Assuming global GDP growth averaging 3.7% in 2019, we expect that oil demand growth will be 1.4% [...] With oil equities pricing in $70/bbl & the full impact of Iran yet to be felt, we remain overweight the sector.”

4261 2018-10-24 16:14:30 Hundreds of billions of pounds is likely to be spent on extracting oil and gas from 'UK' waters over the next THREE decades, according to leading industry experts.

So much for The oil is running out.

No wonder England is desperate to get this wealth and leave Scotland poor.

4272 2018-10-24 16:13:31 Have you read my commentary about Russia playing the oil exporters and China as a way of destroying oil/gas competitors in a soon-imploding market and reducing China's power to that of a partner, junior partner, or broken-up set of puppet states?

Any thoughts?
4273 2018-10-24 16:13:29 I repeat Supreme does not make oil carts

4291 2018-10-24 16:10:54 Norway has an $800 bn debt. Their fund is only invested outside of Norway. The state owns ~69% of Statoil/Equinor. Oil companies in Canada are public companies, not state-owned. Province of AB owns the mineral rights and leases them to companies. Different set up entirely.
4292 2018-10-24 16:10:51 Where does the assumption come from that "everybody is producing at its max?" 
Outages are quotidian and are included in the YTD data. Higher prices result in more drilling which results in more oil.

-wash hands frequently even if you're not using the restroom. Hand sanitizer is better than nothing but soap and water works best.

4306 2018-10-24 16:09:36 A year ago, during the #PriceOfOil news bonanza about Big Oil corruption and harm in Canada (and Saskatchewan), a few prominent journalists including a couple at @CBCSask got very snippy with me. They insisted they do all they can to bring us those stories.

4309 2018-10-24 16:09:15 At least not if you are making a serious physical effort. 
At a guess, you could do 5, maybe 6 hours of effort having consumed only oil (and water), then it'd get tough you could start getting cramps, diarrhea and morale could be a challenge...

4317 2018-10-24 16:08:22 Japan just successfully delayed adoption of tougher future efficiency regs for oil tankers, with support of Liberia. “There’s not enough data” they argue, so the question of whether there’s enough data will go back to the working group.

4323 2018-10-24 16:07:37 It's likely that any market in palm oil will continue to lead to deforestation. Just as the market in ivory continues to lead to the killing of Elephants.
4324 2018-10-24 16:07:32 (E) When I see these, I think @gaslands_game @GaslandsGarage... already a oil dropper at the back, just need a few "Homies Touches", like rocket launchers, mini guns... they'd be table ready in no time. LOL #Gaslands #tabletopgaming
4325 2018-10-24 16:07:26 The UK though is set on the same trajectory and has, through the finance, pharma, oil and gas and arms industries, been discrediting the democracies' claims to virtue for years.
4326 2018-10-24 16:07:25 It makes me laugh when I see things about girls not doing shit to their cars... I get my oil changed every 3000 miles, I rotate my tires, I go in to my car place almost too much  Gina is a freaking spoiled brat
4327 2018-10-24 16:07:16 Ok I have the milk, but I think I will get the oil also. Haven't got into cooking with it yet
4328 2018-10-24 16:07:14 You’re going to bet what is likely your most important investment, as well as your life, on a tire pressure sensor and a low oil pressure light though?

4330 2018-10-24 16:07:09 I hear astrology and "spiritualism" whatever that is, has become very popular among young people. Sounds like snake oil to me. Maybe snakes are still evolving.

4337 2018-10-24 16:06:19 Tesla is the safest, most affordable, best-for-the-enviroment car ever. 1mil miles garentee, no oil changes or emission checks. Only thing you have to change regularly are the tires and windshield wipers. They are fast af too they will outrun most cars that cost the same.
4338 2018-10-24 16:06:01 Sweet orange oil smells so good. It's the exact same smell as when peeling mikan. (*´ω｀*) Of course lavender is still the best. Haven't tried the other scents that came in the set yet.
4339 2018-10-24 16:06:00 The oil without the anointing is just groundnut or olive oil.
4340 2018-10-24 16:05:58 Once we get oil & gas production back on line, this will greatly enhance out economy and dominance in the world. It will also offset a hugh amount of our debt.

4353 2018-10-24 16:05:06 So, as a country, we have decided that importing full priced Saudi oil, in tankers, through the whale filled waters of the St Lawrence river is a better choice than buying our own Canadian oil at a steep discount, thus supporting human rights and our own economy.

4389 2018-10-24 16:02:15 "other oils" have always been a mystifying" - it's always been terrible! Same for fuel oil as well which I suspect is partly in the other oils actually. But at least this year we know the ethane crackers coming and can remove that part from the other oils demand.

4394 2018-10-24 16:02:02 I think the oil running out fox is shot. So expect the media to say we are all changing to renewables and electric cars so, whilst Scotland clearly has vast oil resources, these will be worthless. But, because of climate change, our wind will definitely run out in 5 years.
4395 2018-10-24 16:01:58 Hypothetically speaking, if MbS swears loyalty to Erdogan, willingness to sign KSA as a subordinate ally to Turkey and offers to sell cheap oil, why wouldn't Ergodan take the offers? Any other choice of crown prince won't give him nearly as much control.
4396 2018-10-24 16:01:50 Dalila jumped into the kitchen counter and knocked a full glass bottle of olive oil on to the floor and I kindof want to die
4397 2018-10-24 16:01:49 Let me know if it works for you.  When I don't have time I just sniff from the bottle (sounds dodgy but it's not). Like if I am running somewhere and need an instant pick me up I just get the bottle,  and inhale the aroma of the oil. Those essential oils also good for massage

I bought Zuora at 27 and now it's down to 19 and I bought Marathon oil at $79.64 and now it's down to $68.81 Should I continue to hold these stocks?

4481 2018-10-24 15:53:30 If I was president, I'd declare Wednesday a new type of day. I'd call it Midday, and there would be no work. You could get your house in order, change the oil on your car, or just take care of all the other shit you've been putting off till the weekend.
4482 2018-10-24 15:53:28 Break off diplomatic relations altogether, how the hell much more evidence do we need of their abominable nation. I suppose nearly 4000 dead on 9/11 is just the price you have to pay for cheap oil huh America?

4485 2018-10-24 15:53:16 Do these contain palm oil, or does the low temperature allow you to use other vegetable oils, or even make them from chocolate?

4512 2018-10-24 15:51:57 Oil research? China has been approaching all the nations who have claims on the SCS to do joint development for decades. Many have rejected. Do you think if Vietnam decides to drill that Malaysia, Philippines will stand by and not do anything?
4513 2018-10-24 15:51:55 The clue is in its name it should actually be Scottish tax revenue, along with our Oil tax revenue since the early 70's. That is why Mrs Thatcher could not let Scotland have its Independence. We were a real Thistle thorn in her side. Scotland did keep the UK afloat in the 80's
4514 2018-10-24 15:51:42 While oil and gas are being phased out, we should ban imports and rely solely on what we extract from platforms in Scottish waters. This would be the ideal option ecologically (and for employment) for as long as we use fossil fuels.

4525 2018-10-24 15:50:44 You can substitute the butter with coconut oil and the cream with a non-dairy substitute and there's vegan "cheese".. I don't know if it'll taste the same though but it can be done with vegan ingredients
4526 2018-10-24 15:50:42 i’ve tried everything except diff brand of nipple cream! i’ve tried breast milk, coconut oil, lanolin :/
4527 2018-10-24 15:50:41 Every plant or tree in Canada planted by food producers and forestry industry takes CO2 and converts to oxygen?  Why are these industries being penalized so heavily?  We easily offset other industries in Canada like mining and oil/gas!!!  We need industry in Canada!

4543 2018-10-24 15:49:35 I really do. I stay putting toner, aloe, and coconut oil on every day though. It’s gotten better believe it or not
4544 2018-10-24 15:49:26 Current barrel price is $80 something. Multiply that by 5 and you've got close to $400 per barrel. Since, India is selling oil at 80 something per litre for consumers. Keeping with current comparison, Oil will sell for more than 400 rupees per litre

4550 2018-10-24 15:49:10 Can go tit for tat on these types of arguments ad nauseam. Better discussion is why oil rich countries in the ME did not build diverse economies and broad, stable middle classes? Can’t blame the West for that and those countries continue to deal with that legacy.

It is blocking oil research and fisheries and and making excessive claims in international waters and ofcourse island building and weaponising them far away from China’s coast, even within PH seabed.

4577 2018-10-24 15:47:04 Sure. The demand/supply rule
Saudi accounts for nearly 7.5% of oil supply in the world market. 

The rule of thumb for oil markets is that if the supply decreases by 1% without being compensated, oil prices will increase 20%. Oil price will increase 5x the current price.

4596 2018-10-24 15:45:03 Did you really just say 'ricin seeds?' LOL They were castor seeds. They were literally the seeds of a plant that are in no way harmful. You would have to go throughthe process of using those seeds to make castor oil and then take a by product of it to make ricin.

4600 2018-10-24 15:44:34 Anyone with half a brain would understand that relations and I mean close relations with Saudi is imperative.  This is important because of poor relations with Iran, our promise to protect Israel, our own safety in this nation, oil needs, ISIS, Gand a host of other reasons.

4602 2018-10-24 15:44:22 I think that’s an interesting point; I’m thinking more of this recent oil downturn. Surely many midstream cos survived sub $40-$50 oil and I think the sensitivity to rates is partially insulated. Most is fixed rate debt and laddered.

4605 2018-10-24 15:44:12 Wow you know what tea tree oil is working so well with my skin
4606 2018-10-24 15:44:07 Why should USA have been so heavily & culpably involved in ME for decades? Oil. Trump campaigned on energy independence.
4607 2018-10-24 15:44:03 An oil trap? This is interesting...
4608 2018-10-24 15:43:56 It is a stupid policy though. It's self fulfilling. We import in USD, and as the US QE's their dollar, we import that inflation with it (esp OIL). South African's are basically being punished for something they have no control over. 

Get your act together. That's all we ask.
4609 2018-10-24 15:43:47 Any suggestion, ano magandang brand ng tea tree oil? And saan nabibili?
Wala akong makita sa mercury

4611 2018-10-24 15:43:40 When are you putting a carbon tax on all the Saudi oil coming into Canada? There’s billions of dollars worth of oil coming in to eastern Canada tax free!!
4612 2018-10-24 15:43:31 oh yeah i seen whaa u do on that oil 
4613 2018-10-24 15:43:31 It’s an oil trap, saved you a click
4614 2018-10-24 15:43:18 He has us by the balls. We need his oil. Maybe a little diplomacy is required here. You know reach out to Iran. Start talking. Let's see where that goes? Maybe just maybe, some headway can be made. Not talking accomplishes nothing.
4615 2018-10-24 15:43:12 I just got a free oil change so I can already tell it’s gonna be a great day

4622 2018-10-24 15:42:48 All that stuff doesn’t even mean much...it’s about where the money is...imagine the US crude inventories just got released and there’s more supply than demand....but oil prices steady rising as USDCAD falls...its all in understanding the money cycle and psychology
4623 2018-10-24 15:42:47 For Example: Venezuela’s highest-ever oil production occurred in 1998 at 3.5 million barrels per day. That also happened to be the year before Hugo Chavez was sworn into office in Venezuela. During the Venezuelan general strike of 2002–2003, Chavez fired 19,000 employees of the

4625 2018-10-24 15:42:20 Re heavy oil discount in Canada - surely there must be legal actions that could be taken by producing provinces to end the current and hugely costly impasse about pipelines.  At a cost of $30 billion per year, these $ are gone forever.  Crazy.  #BUILD PIPELINES
4626 2018-10-24 15:42:18 I’m tired and stressed and the last thing I need is him giving up on me. Because I’m trying I’m really trying my boss just gave me a raise and is paying for my oil change because I came in to work in tears and she said you do so much for this place it’s the least I can do

4628 2018-10-24 15:42:09 Those folks really ARE that dense. Absolutely zero critical thinking skills. You should have asked him the same question about oil, which we ARE in fact using up. Watch his head explode with that one.
4629 2018-10-24 15:42:09 Even with these issues at the current level of technology it is still far better then oil or coal and arguably better than natural gas due to technology limitations as to itself.
4630 2018-10-24 15:42:05 Sitting at the dealership, waiting on an oil change, bored as fuck
4631 2018-10-24 15:42:02 In the old days, Trump’s base would have been the people buying from the Snake Oil salesman. We definitely need to teach more critical thinking skills in schools.  Pathetic
4632 2018-10-24 15:41:57 That seems to be TM’s system. Firing it up the boards since he arrived in Edmonton.
4633 2018-10-24 15:41:56 Here is a fact from Public Records --  
So far in 2018, Denham, Jeff (R-CA)  has received $237,437 in "contributions" from the Oil & Gas industry. 
This ranks in the TOP 10 of House Reps and in the TOP 15 of ALL Congress in Big Money from Oil & Gas.

4635 2018-10-24 15:41:52 much higher royalties, and when they refused...he told them to leave. So...they did. The state owned oil and gas companies are poorly ran due to years of mismanagement and underinvestment by the GOVT’ ITSELF. Really, Venezuela has nobody to blame but themselves here.
4636 2018-10-24 15:41:46 omg the other day i tweeted that cbd oil tastes like green tea!! Twins!!!
4637 2018-10-24 15:41:42 Of course they refused to do business with them.... Venezuela’s socialist policies held back its own economy during the oil boom and are the direct cause of its economic collapse today. Hugo Chavez tore up contracts with multinational oil and gas companies and began demanding

4680 2018-10-24 15:39:00 I read an article today that explained the economics of why an unrest in Saudi will cause oil prices to fall - apparently that’s what has been happening. 10%+ down as at the time of the article.
4681 2018-10-24 15:38:48 for best results, soak me in jojoba oil
4682 2018-10-24 15:38:47 again, way off topic but can come from oil companies - their scientists know the volatility of product - it would be in their best interest and profit to make standards on their product to ensure it gets delivered in a safe way
4683 2018-10-24 15:38:44 This would be different from newer cars with oil life monitors that explicitly give you a signal to change the oil
4684 2018-10-24 15:38:42 but you are misunderstaing the gain , if its to pay for eco.

pardon the pun but the money to do so doesnt grow on trees , and as I said without indy the oil will still flow from the North Sea under Westminster rule - without being spent on eco.

4691 2018-10-24 15:37:41 Hell yea. I got my oil changed in Chatom yesterday because I was way past due. Before the guy done anything he noticed that it was leaking from somewhere and it’s because last time I was at the dealership they cross threaded a bolt which was causing my oil to leak
4692 2018-10-24 15:37:26 The question has to be asked why are the DUP so pro Brexit? I believe it's because they see opportunity. Opportunity for back handed oil deals. Dirty little trade deals with plenty of back handers and bribes. Opportunity to fatten their bank accounts.

4697 2018-10-24 15:37:13 Remember, they increased production last month.  What is being stored is relatively small to what they already sold.  Focusing on "storage" is just a way to justify the statements of those who said Iran oil exports declined substantially.

4713 2018-10-24 15:36:30 That makes sense because Saudis are running a big budget deficit due to the war (around $ 80-90 billion) and low oil prices. They must be desperate to end the war.
4714 2018-10-24 15:36:22 As we see, USA regime only like money.
So they can tolerate Saudi regime killing journalist and other civilians in Yemen and even supporting ISIS.
Just because Saudi can give USA money and oil but Taliban can't.
USA never care about who's the real terrorist.

4723 2018-10-24 15:35:52 I’m doing good today with my keto only black coffee so far with MCT oil 
4724 2018-10-24 15:35:49 Yan ba yung may argan oil?
4725 2018-10-24 15:35:47 A thicker version. More concentrated, compressed version. You might get it in stores. Online for sure. Cold Pressed Jamaican Castor Oil is the best. It's quite dark in colour
4726 2018-10-24 15:35:46 There’s a vast “minority” population in Iran that is fed up with being treated like they are second-class citizens. Add that to the Islamic Republic’s economic woes and the women’s freedom movement and... What’s the boiling point of crude oil? #4Nov
4727 2018-10-24 15:35:44 I said I was previously against the Euro but as it is going up and up in value whilst the pound goes backwards it is back in my personal reckoning. I prefer to have parity with Norwegian kroner & set up a Euro petrodollar for future oil sales but that is outside the box thinking.
4728 2018-10-24 15:35:43 You stand in a room with curved walls, which is nearly empty but for an oil lamp sitting on a butler statue with a tray.

4733 2018-10-24 15:35:13 Who was it who begged George Osborne to slash the tax on oil companies? Oh, it was John Swinney, erstwhile finance minister in Sco, before going on to ruin Scottish education.

4737 2018-10-24 15:34:27 No, Brexit was a bad idea pushed by bad people and now, no-one can deliver the hollow promises made by snake oil salesmen
4738 2018-10-24 15:34:20 Cam has been decent, but hasn't won us any games. Oil can have a fine season with that sort of goaltending, but I'm greedy for more & Cam needs to play at next level for that to be possible (or Kos needs to surprise).
4739 2018-10-24 15:34:12 No. Nigeria is well able to take care of its population if only they clamped down on corruption and used their resources better. Stop paying more attention to those greedy international oil corporations and focus on empowering their pple more.

4744 2018-10-24 15:33:27 40m is Euro elite territory for a full back. Even you have to admit, Juve is playing ball. There are rich clubs backed by oil or mafia money, who launder through football clubs, and then there is Barca, Juve, and Madrid who spend this kind of money. No other category exist.
4745 2018-10-24 15:33:23 I dont disagree , but wheres the watching of methane levels in the atmosphere leaching from pemafrost and glaciers?

The single biggest thing RIGHT now to combat that , ban beef and dairy , then reforest the planet with fast growing trees , ban palm oil too.

4754 2018-10-24 15:32:26 Their problem is their “leaders” make money from oil, gas, coal, fracking.... so they tell the sheep/base the “evils” of #CleanEnergy #Environmentalism
4755 2018-10-24 15:32:23 How about suspending Saudi imports ?  
I know a place where we can get some oil for cheap.

4759 2018-10-24 15:32:18 After this unprecedented move by PM Khan, of bringing the huge sum of $6bn from KSA, which itself is a plausible step especially regarding deffered payment for oil imports. Now the next thing he should focus on bringing the distorted Muslim Ummah on one single strong platform.
4760 2018-10-24 15:32:16 You're not free market then. You said green energy is better for the environment. Therefore, it has more benefits at the same cost of oil. Therefore, you should switch to it. 

Why the hypocrisy?
4761 2018-10-24 15:32:14 Not outside of the scope to say it's possible this was to stir up the left wing base. Bombs were all easily detected (possibly leaking oil, smell suspicious, etc), many were not "armed".  Nothing would surprise me these days.
4762 2018-10-24 15:32:13 I came across Bordoff/CGEP while gathering all white papers on LNG/oil exports. I tracked 60+ of these in a spreadsheet. He also popped up in a Commerce FOIA I made. I came across Yergin last summer while writing abt API. I didn’t see desmog article until you linked it.

4764 2018-10-24 15:31:42 All oils go last in your night routine, after your moisturizer. Definitely not excessive. Oils seal everything in which helps your skin to retain moisture. Also, rosehip oil is high in vitamin A which is great for hyperpigmentation.

4792 2018-10-24 15:29:38 just make sure when you take your vehicle in, it needs new brakes, radiator, timing belt, an oil leak fixed and transmission service. that did it for us!
4793 2018-10-24 15:29:36 When in doubt remember Da Vinci painted a fresco with oil paint. Oil paint spoils on fresco. He also knew that but didn't care less. #lifegoals #artschool

4802 2018-10-24 15:28:49 But keep that Saudi oil flowing you double talking clown
4803 2018-10-24 15:28:46 It seems the hip phrase to use in describing relationships or people in general is “toxic”.  I don’t think it’s fair to call people that.  We all know water & oil don’t mix, but that doesn’t mean that apart they can’t both be great.  We can all be “toxic” in one way or another.
4804 2018-10-24 15:28:45 It’s some kind of rosehip oil.
4805 2018-10-24 15:28:40 Can’t wait to get an alignment and an oil change today, my car is about to drive branddddd new

4809 2018-10-24 15:28:11 Sometimes you just gotta add a dash of salt and olive oil.  Do the little things right and the big ones will fall into place
4810 2018-10-24 15:28:06 Anoint your body with oil
4811 2018-10-24 15:28:02 so turns out, u get oil changes after x amount of miles and not when the light turns on........ 
i’ve had my car since this past february.........
4812 2018-10-24 15:27:31 Yes, it appears that Saudi is involved in Oil price rigging, and as they got trapped into Kasoggi killing, it seems they are taking risks off and this lead to Oil price drop. Modi should think differently to bring Oil prices down.
4813 2018-10-24 15:27:18 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.

4823 2018-10-24 15:26:32 A big part of the problem with the UK economy is that we hollowed out our manufacturing by spending oil revenues domestically, rather than putting them in a wealth fund.

4825 2018-10-24 15:26:15 Canadian crude oil gets a better price when shipped out of BC compared to current Edmonton prices as it is connected to waterborne markets (international prices without logistical constraints)

4830 2018-10-24 15:25:31 Really good question. Of course, the most important point in much of this is that you can't really spend oil money in the domestic economy, because of the Dutch Disease. That's why Norway's Sovereign Wealth fund is all invested externally.
4831 2018-10-24 15:25:22 There are no UK waters in terms of oil and gas. There are Scottish and English waters. The oil is in the Scottish sector. It's Scotland's Oil!!!

4834 2018-10-24 15:25:10 Technically not a loan, 3 billion for a year and they will take it back. Oil payments deferred which you have to pay eventually, Even you are adamant on calling this loan this whole package will help in balancing payments for now,

4863 2018-10-24 15:23:01 pls add palm oil.. Na so my village pple want am
4864 2018-10-24 15:22:58 Saudi Arabia be like "oh you withdrawing from entering into contracts with us? Cool... we'll raise the price of oil then. Take that!"
4865 2018-10-24 15:22:53 Ya know Trump don't like reporters so he ain't really bothered but I feel the oil prices would get he head hot lol
4866 2018-10-24 15:22:52 So I heard of hype juice (never had it) so now I’m hearing about a “oil” . Somone please lace me up lmao
4867 2018-10-24 15:22:52 It’s the NYC Subway....what makes you think it’s a woman?
4868 2018-10-24 15:22:51 You are the one assuming anyone who disagrees is paid by the oil companies
4869 2018-10-24 15:22:46 Oh, the sarcasm seeps through your words like oil. Unfortunately I must go, but perhaps when I return later we can have another lovely chat! I love chatting with @realDonaldFool, and I apologise if I am upsetting you, because it seems your side is really destructive when offended
4870 2018-10-24 15:22:36 I just said how I need a good moisturizer since it’s getting cold and rose water not gone cut it. I bought two things of virgin coconut oil, and I’m using it on my face. When I say my skin so soft. I can’t wait to see the long term effects lol.
4871 2018-10-24 15:22:34 I dream of the day I get to own a new car and I'll know every oil change, service interval, repair, modification, and mile put onto it, and I would drive the wheels off it but to own a car I actually would like the initial investment is SO HIGH compared to my living costs
4872 2018-10-24 15:22:23 We need governments around the world to redirect spending towards a rapid transition away from fossil fuels while at the same time putting in place disincentives for their use. There's no point having money from oil extraction if there's no planet to spend it on.
4873 2018-10-24 15:22:20 Sa pagkaka alam ko ay mayroon tayong oil.

4875 2018-10-24 15:22:17 Having two cars on campus is useless when they both need oil changes
4876 2018-10-24 15:22:09 I have my car payment, oil change, and Tanner's xbox. I need a sign from the Lord rn man
4877 2018-10-24 15:22:03 So why did they take Uba but not "capital oil" stations and trucks for questioning?
4878 2018-10-24 15:22:01 The tight margins of oil sands production creates economic risks to the Canadian economy. Benefits derived from rising oil prices are insignificant compared to the negative effects rising energy prices have on Canadian consumers who matter more to national economic health.
4879 2018-10-24 15:21:43 OH HELL YES are you serious?!   

If I didn't have to drive in snow 2-3 months out of the year, the Type R would be my next car, they are GORGEOUS! I drool over them every time I take Lil's CR-V in to get the oil changed. <3 <3 <3
4880 2018-10-24 15:21:37 My roommate gave me a Carolina reaper hybrid to help cultivate. Fun fact. This hybrid's leaves also have the oil that burns. I accidentally touched a leave and then rubbed my nose. Face on fire. Oh God make it stop. Tell my family I love them and delete my browser history.
4881 2018-10-24 15:21:32 Yes have pressed in the past. They are very dry which is why I thought I might oil them and then possibly arrange them in a frame. Busy decorating at the moment though.

4891 2018-10-24 15:20:37 36x220=just short of 8000 barrels of oil, or circa half a million quid in revenue ....not bad for a flow test which is still on going

Jerusalem only will disarm for Diplomatic & Territorial Purposes, Riyadh only will waste oil & money opposing this idea that is good business for the evil.., right Prince dear...?

If money were to be time it could buy it, but we all will die.

4894 2018-10-24 15:20:15 Are you supposed to change it like your oil?
4895 2018-10-24 15:20:11 Just wanted to say that I love @TheBodyShopUK Pre Shampoo Coconut Hair Oil. Been using it as a daily leave in treatment and I think it has definitely livened up my hair in a good way. And if you've got hair like mine, that's impressive... 
4896 2018-10-24 15:20:06 Where im from oil change is $20 & full synthetic is like $40 lmao

4898 2018-10-24 15:19:53 What about suncor.  Oil is by far Canada s largest export. Twice as much money as auto exports.
4899 2018-10-24 15:19:51 Baby literally made sure he teaches me how to check oil and refill, water and refill, how to put pressure in the tyres and how to kick-start or jump-start a car... All warning lights and what they mean just incase he isn't around. 
4900 2018-10-24 15:19:51 You are so shallow and incapable of seeing beyond your very own nose.

4905 2018-10-24 15:19:38 Shocking. 

This is one of the olive  in my garden. Around 30ft tall. I have  3 olive processors within 10mins drive of where I live. 

The oil I use is organic and 100% olive. I also have garlic olive oil and chilli olive oil for different flavours. 

Thanks for sharing.

4913 2018-10-24 15:18:55 You must be anticipating a lot of cash flow to be tossing out figures to  your tax heist. The oil sands and the deforestation of our land and mining are our biggest threats to the environment. Revamp their tax structure first before taxes the general fleeced taxpayers

4921 2018-10-24 15:18:18 Well, Prime Minister Dressup said he wanted to phase out the Oil Sands. Nobody believed him. The CBC did some sort of a P.R. whitewash. Guess what? Mission accomplished.

4923 2018-10-24 15:17:48 Oil services have priced their services and equipment wrongly. A case in point is the day rate for unconventionals despite more work load is being completed in a day than four years ago.... and sub-divide service packages doesn’t help either, unconventional or not
4924 2018-10-24 15:17:45 The problem he is, he is selling oil to someone dieing of thirst and they are buying. Its a mirage!!!

4930 2018-10-24 15:17:10 I’m trying out the oil to help me sleep.  It’s surprising how much variation there in in terms of oils and how some help you sleep and others keep you awake!
4931 2018-10-24 15:17:09 What about almond oil?  I've seen a number of recipes lately calling for that...  Thanks!
4932 2018-10-24 15:17:04 Anyhow, that's enough politics for now. I'm almost at work and I never mix work in politics. I keep them separated like oil and water. That's why you never see me reply to anything like that until after work. It's always a smart move to keep business and pleasure separated

4940 2018-10-24 15:16:28 Unless theres a magic wand those cars, busses, lorries and firengines are gonna need oil.

Scotland has a finite defined time to use it for the changeover, or let Westminster do it for profit instead.

4942 2018-10-24 15:16:16 A carbon tax creates the incentive to diversify the Canadian economy and, if the additional revenue is appropriated properly, claw back the $3.3B in federal and provincial oil/gas subsidies and potentially replace/reduce gasoline taxes.

4949 2018-10-24 15:15:48 But there's no real reason for gas to be this expensive.  Only greedy oil company execs, and exorbitant taxes are to blame.  It's 5 bucks a gallon in California because of all the extra taxes that are being spent on caring for illegals...
4950 2018-10-24 15:15:43 Thing is, oil industry has been behaving like mighty god kings of the north—unaccountable, corrupt and debauched. As oil collapses, all that rot is going to spill out. There’s going to be a hell of a mess we’re going to have to clean up.

5002 2018-10-24 15:12:35 Supporting banks: >$700 billion
Military: >$716 billion
Addressing climate change: ~$20 billion
Oil & Gas Subsidies: >$20 billion

Someone who is good at civilization, please help me budget this. My planet is dying.
5003 2018-10-24 15:12:26 If you plan to do a lot of towing and your vehicle is not already equipped with coolers, consider having them added. Aftermarket engine oil and transmission fluid coolers are simple, low-cost add-ons that operate on the same principle as your car’s radiator.
5004 2018-10-24 15:12:19 Definitely not oil 
5005 2018-10-24 15:12:14 The human oil will still be safe, as long as there aren't any other ingredients in it that horses can't have. Horses are very sensitive to CBD, start with a small amount and moniter the pony. If the pony seems lethargic or sleepy, that would be a little too much
5006 2018-10-24 15:12:12 We are closed today due to the weather. We hope everyone stays safe and dry today.
5007 2018-10-24 15:12:10 Just when you think your foundation can't get any better cuz well it's amazing you use Revolution's baking oil and it looks even more amazing! Dry skin girls: tip if you wanna try matte or demi matte foundation get this baking oil!  @MakeupRVLTN
5008 2018-10-24 15:12:03 ？
5009 2018-10-24 15:11:50 indica + CBD and then get a humidifier and also invest in some lavender oil along with eucalyptus for stress and relaxation
5010 2018-10-24 15:11:49 Clearly this that time of year where lotion isn’t enough. Niggas gonna have to start putting on Vaseline. Baby oil gahdamn
5011 2018-10-24 15:11:37 Same in the oil field bro I can’t even order foood!!! Hit me with that me no hable everytime 
5012 2018-10-24 15:11:35 Because we are not corrupt, TSA does not need probe...after all, oil is now 45naira per litter and no more subsidy payment!
5013 2018-10-24 15:11:35 Very close friend in industry though tells tales of guys who will not do well in other jobs. Guys who’ve been getting huge paycheques to work as labourers and haven’t developed skills. Also big problems w/ addiction in oil sector that won’t be overlooked elsewhere.
5014 2018-10-24 15:11:25 Yoga . And peppermint oil
5015 2018-10-24 15:11:21 I told my co workers I put butter instead of vegetable oil in the muffins and they said I’m trying clog their arteries 
5016 2018-10-24 15:11:14 Why settle for a bank when you can get the entire oil industry.
5017 2018-10-24 15:11:09 Aren't gasoline stockpiles down due to refinery maintenance? Guess the same goes for oil stocks being up, right? Maybe? Or not?
5018 2018-10-24 15:11:02 I sell organic oil for hair/ skin care nd black soap made from natural ingredients suitable for all skin types at very affordable prices.pls RT nd patronise thanks.
5019 2018-10-24 15:11:01 good session on horrific subject. Glad to hear view sufferring Yemenis may get respite in exchange for US rehabilitation of MBS and a return to status quo. My fear is  Saudi guilt just means more oil - also worth asking what Turkey might want from the US to not rock the boat
5020 2018-10-24 15:11:00 Pensions are getting later and at a far lower level than most of Europe at 28% of earnings. 68? That is mad. Simple case to improve and use oil and whisky revenues for increasing pensions above UK. Aim for Irish levels in 10 years or so. It depends how bad Brexit is as I said.
5021 2018-10-24 15:10:55 Potatoes are actually insanely high satiety, as long as you don’t flavor them with salt and oil.

All meat is what has worked best for me but it has some problems of it’s own, and also doesn’t solve the fundamental problem of wanting and being tempted by icecream and breads.
5022 2018-10-24 15:10:52 No macros?  then why do I keep this giant bottle of MCT oil at my bedside to swig from just in case at the end of the day my fat is only 79.9%
5023 2018-10-24 15:10:33 Btw...at wot rate Saudis hv sold oil to us?
5024 2018-10-24 15:10:29 No thanks palm oil and ndomie 
5025 2018-10-24 15:10:24 Now Japan desparate to prevent tougher future efficiency standards for oil tankers, claiming there is not enough data to make a decision. Although Japan have for years been running the working group at IMO responsible for getting such data

And Madam Sherry Rehman only watches PTI videos. She is not allowed to watch PPP or ZARDARI videos. How can she comment. Otherwise ZARDARI will do
5031 2018-10-24 15:09:46 I better start stocking up on gas and heating oil before  @golden4congress wins and makes it illegal to purchase fossil fuels. #mepolitics
5032 2018-10-24 15:09:41 It’s the enforcement of that right to security of one’s own data which is nigh impossible. Impossible because data is the new oil. Like oil , it will be controlled by the few.
5033 2018-10-24 15:09:41 terima kasih aisyah yg disayangi ain juga. tapi baru lepas terbakar sikit atas bibir gara2 tea tree oil aiken huhu.
5034 2018-10-24 15:09:39 Blew my nose the other week and it was like a red and green oil painting.
5035 2018-10-24 15:09:37 If only the Irving refineries wanted to refine Canadian oil
5036 2018-10-24 15:09:37 Gental magic soap and serum, day and night.

I also use Justine tissue oil when I leave the house
5037 2018-10-24 15:09:36 2018 Oil available!

5040 2018-10-24 15:09:30 1. Hydrating my face with rose water helps to control oil throughout the day. 2. Don’t just line your lips with lip liner put it all over the same way you would a lipstick to make the color last longer for liquid lipsticks.
5041 2018-10-24 15:09:30 The list of targets in today’s bomb alerts shares a lot in common with the list of people constantly targeted in our commander in chief’s speeches ... when you throw oil on fire, what do you expect ? #cuckoo #Vote
5042 2018-10-24 15:09:28 Tiny robots no bigger than a cell could be mass-produced using a new method developed by researchers at MIT. The microscopic devices might eventually be used to monitor conditions inside an oil or gas pipeline, or to search out disease while floating through the bloodstream …

5046 2018-10-24 15:09:05 They're not building any pipelines.  Why do we import Saudi oil and sell ours at a discount ?  Because Canadians are stupid.  Build a pipeline from Alberta to Montreal (to the refinery).  Better yet, build a refinery in Alberta and shut the one down in Montreal.
5047 2018-10-24 15:09:01 Yup! Axe body wash then water then baby oil!
5048 2018-10-24 15:08:57 lagay ako ng lagay ng castor oil pero parang di naman effective
5049 2018-10-24 15:08:51 In fact, we imported no olive oil on MFN, so I used a weighted average of the 2 biggest categories (6.3%). This is a good illustration of why this table is a deliberate gross over-estimate.
For sugar, I used the tariff for cane sugar for refining (not the highest tariff)...2/2
5050 2018-10-24 15:08:50 A pillow salesman who claims to know the will of God and a snake oil huckster who yells at poopies. These are the political enemies of the left and I still don’t trust them to seal the deal in November.
5051 2018-10-24 15:08:46 WE 10.19 - another big US crude oil build adding 6.3m. US inventories currently at 422.8m.  Gasoline declined but remain 12.5m higher than last year. Crude exports rebounded this week increasing to 2.18mb/d.
5052 2018-10-24 15:08:41 Fraud. You push to privatize profits and socialize costs. Just like the oil and coal industries want. Your entire life has been paid for by the tax payers. Your house is paid for by tax payers. Your kids school is paid for by taxpayers. Take your 500k Koch bribe and leave.
5053 2018-10-24 15:08:39 I had my first car for a year and never got the oil changed. When my dad asked me I was like what???? I was supposed to do that when???
5054 2018-10-24 15:08:36 CBD oil for pony anxiety? What dosage? I have 250mg human oil, can I use that for him?

5059 2018-10-24 15:08:08 Yeah loved the way Obama stood up to China, North Korea told UN that he would back out if they didn't pay fair share slapped tariffs on countries to force fare trade got better trade deals with Mexico and Canada got Germany to buy our oil instead of Russian thanks Obama, NOT!
5060 2018-10-24 15:08:05 I said we are the 3rd largest ECONOMICAL reserve in the world.  And our oil is literally sleeping out of the ground.  Or you can drill a well in 7 days.  The most technically complex?  Have you ever worked in the field? 
5061 2018-10-24 15:08:03 Perhaps it’s bad policy for the govt to say that. But I will, “THE OIL INDUSTRY IS GOING TO DIE, GET OUT WHILE THE GETTINGS GOOD!!”

 Portland, KL4 and KL3 zones, the 2018 EWT's prime goal is to confirm that the wellbore is connected to a commercially viable oil volume within one or more of the three zones.

5069 2018-10-24 15:06:44 She is playing White Privilege Twister

And I would love to throw a massive slick of oil on her game mat
5070 2018-10-24 15:06:40 First, Canada is not a climate Bad Boy, we are tiny net GHG producer. Yes we have hi per capita GHG because:  We produce 3 million barrels of oil/day for the USA, we R a very cold country + we have huge transport burden because of our scattered population.
5071 2018-10-24 15:06:39 My best guess is that this would over-estimate the amount of tariff by somewhere around 200%-300%. I make 2 exceptions: for the "fats" category, rather than assuming it's all olive oil at the highest (25%+) tariff, I went down a level...1/2
5072 2018-10-24 15:06:14 I’m 5,000 miles past an oil change but you know ya bitch is gonna get her hair done instead when I get paid tomorrow
5073 2018-10-24 15:06:13 Oil of oregano, tastes like ass but it works, mix it in juice a few times a day...works

5077 2018-10-24 15:05:58 For many years in my youth I worked for a carnival,for the most part can recognize a snake oil salesmen when I see one............and I see you Donald Trump aka Mr Snake Oil
5078 2018-10-24 15:05:48 And as the chicken floats by you can see it slowly getting a golden brown, as the timer gets down you see it getting burnt and the oil gets more violent.

Instead of ring outs you drop them into the oil, and a larger fried drumstick comes out of where they fell
5079 2018-10-24 15:05:48 the Norwegians and the Arabs have invested their oil money as a hedge against the time when their oil revenues dry up

But what they invested their money in was/is entirely dependent on continuing infinite world oil flow

without that, their wealth funds are worth zilch

Those failing adhering to Nuclear Disarmament are advocating a lasting conflict to sale Armament in the Near East, at some moment even Riyadh & Tehran watching their wallets will support containing Palestine within Gaza borders..., Sir.. 

Oil's not forever...
5082 2018-10-24 15:05:32 what legal measures if they are above the law? just by threatening $200 dollar oil barrel all claims just banish,
5083 2018-10-24 15:05:27 Time for your snake oil.
5084 2018-10-24 15:05:26 Sa panahon kasi ngayon, COCONUT OIL na lang ang virgin. TANGHALI na lang ang tapat. BILIHIN na lang ang nagmamahal. PIMPLES na lang ang hindi nang-iiwan. IHI na lang ang nagpapakilig. Ang TRUST naman, naging condom na. At isa pa, You find true love in, SAN MARINO TUNA.
5085 2018-10-24 15:05:16 Love you Jessica but damn even discounted to $65 for CBD oil is still not  cheap enough to afford. Not going to stop addicts from getting their fix in other ways & prohibits me from buying it.
5086 2018-10-24 15:05:11 Guys I know in oil sector have hella transferable skills, like trades, engineering and project mgmt.

5090 2018-10-24 15:04:47 Am I wrong about your recent outreach? How much of what you do involves trying to bring communities (not oil companies) in and work with them to find out how you can work together?  We're talking about coalition building.
5091 2018-10-24 15:04:46 Well said oil da your head #everywherestew
5092 2018-10-24 15:04:45 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Dear President Trump, please stop the U.S. war crimes in Yemen. And please tell Saudi Arabia to F@ck off. We don't need their money or oil.
5093 2018-10-24 15:04:38 I had the computer in the transmission replaced 9 months after I bought it, the AC condenser/compressor went out a month after that, then replaced the thermostat once already, plus oil leaks. Now need to replace thermostat and hoses again. It’s expensive!

5095 2018-10-24 15:04:26 How do you explain copper, corn, soybeans etc all lower? Oil lower just recently.  Indicates inflation is slowing doesn't it? Am I miss reading it?
5096 2018-10-24 15:04:02 @elonmusk was behind a Tesla today with a license plate that said OIL LOL 

If you ever give these away, think of me first like I thought of you when I saw this guy's plate lol.

Mind your business
5100 2018-10-24 15:03:36 おやすみなさい
5101 2018-10-24 15:03:36 Not so sure.... prices could be weak at the beginning of the year with seasonal rising inventories... Then, my guess is that the lack of investment in conventional oil should again raise concern at the end of Q2
5102 2018-10-24 15:03:17 CO2 is an industrial byproduct of the oil and gas industry that contributes to climate change processes. That is by definition pollution. Check your dictionary
5103 2018-10-24 15:03:14 Thats a dub! You can't go around touching things that dont belong to you. What if the food was spicy or had oil in it.

5109 2018-10-24 15:02:45 There is nothing to cover up. Carter Page was Male-1 in the Buryakov case and was recruited by Russian spy Victor Podobnyy in 2013. You guys all want the Russians to sell their oil and get the best price. That was against US policy at the time. This election was a conspiracy.

5118 2018-10-24 15:01:35 Dreg buddy. Don’t believe anything politicians say unless it’s backed up by science. Scientists dedicate their life to finding out what the hell us going on.  98% of them say Humans are causing global warming due to co2 emissions. 2% that are funded by oil companies say is crap
5119 2018-10-24 15:01:29 With Saudi Ratna received he can't afford to plus why should he at all...it isn't India's fight...we should mind our own oil business with them

5127 2018-10-24 15:00:57 Hi. Just saw your tweets about being ill. I trained as a nutritionist 22ys ago. found cod liver oil helps with asthma as it is an anti inflammatory. You can get it on prescription. Plus vit c 1000ml will also help with any infection. No contraindications but check. 
5128 2018-10-24 15:00:51 Use firetrucks with water hoses to keep them out, or dig a ditch put oil and straw in it and light it on fire, or shoot them with paint guns and manure bombs, or use the fire planes an dump water, retardant, or water based paint, or manure bombs on them.!!! KEEP THE INVADERS OUT.

5137 2018-10-24 15:00:19 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
5138 2018-10-24 15:00:15 I really came home and my dad fixed my car window , did my oil change , washed Petty and filled the tank up 
5139 2018-10-24 15:00:07 Coconut oil, spinach and hummus then 
5140 2018-10-24 15:00:03 expected yes, but he won't and you know that. They're juiced in with the Kushner deal amongst a bevy of other reasons, mostly pertaining to oil and weapons. This has become a PR cleanup situation, not a murder investigation. No real justice will be dealt.
5141 2018-10-24 15:00:00 Can you explain how Norway seem to be getting a lot more for their oil than what Britain gets. Is it just mismanagement.
5142 2018-10-24 14:59:51 I make my own fragrances with essential oil, I make my shampoo with essence oil, biotin, and distilled water. I never use a store deoderant, I buy non talc powder to put where sweating is worse, under arms I use jojoba oil with a citrus essential oil or a real lemon. The pectin
5143 2018-10-24 14:59:40 Ooh, hadn't tried a couple of those yet. Duly noted.

What's oil pulling?
5144 2018-10-24 14:59:27 @Scaramucci is essentially saying you can’t blame the snake oil salesmen if the people are dumb enough to buy the snake oil. It doesn’t matter that Trump lies as long as his followers are believing them. They have a word for this, “fraud”.
5145 2018-10-24 14:59:23 From an oil economy to a smart oil economy... well said Sir !  #salmanbinhamad #Bahrain #hrhcp 
5146 2018-10-24 14:59:17 US may never get oil stain out that has been allowed to corrupt US. Got US dependent on oil & themselves addicted to the war profits. Turned US from manufacturers of goods to manufacturers of wars for profit. Pacified US w/cheap oil & opioids as they take $ & invest it elsewhere.
5147 2018-10-24 14:59:07 Anyone want some pay what you want commissions so that I dont. Die this next week. 

I really need an oil change and gas and also it's my dads birthday and my credit card payment is due. Everything happens so much all at once aie
5148 2018-10-24 14:59:03 Still waiting for our oil to go negative ...
5149 2018-10-24 14:58:43 stampede broke my oil filter (which i have to pay for), my bumper is still gone, my fridge broke after i just bought groceries... life rox 
5150 2018-10-24 14:58:29 waiting for them over there if they can help us build the infrastructure. If you can work a drill for an oil well, you can work a drill for geothermal. If you can lay pipe for oil, you can lay pipe for geothermal.
5151 2018-10-24 14:58:27 Very "rustic" treats, antler bread & fresh squirrel oil.........I'd try it!

5153 2018-10-24 14:58:00 Saudi Arabia has agreed to give Pakistan $3 billion in foreign currency support for a year and a further loan worth up to $3 billion in deferred payments for oil imports to help stave off a current account crisis.
5154 2018-10-24 14:57:53 Boom!ubos talaga pera daming bayarin dalwang jersey bago t-shirt tapos change oil pa 
5155 2018-10-24 14:57:45 Trump works his two faced focus on Energy Pricing/Crude Oil by getting out if Iran Nuclear Deal forcing energy prices up via supply constraints & now it back fires on him via excess profits downward because economy worries forcing interest rates up! His great economy n fall put
5156 2018-10-24 14:57:45 Yesterday I found a $4 perfume oil that smells EXACTLY (well to me) like Tom Ford Velvet Orchid  I mean I get good discounts at work but I still can’t afford TF. Also they test on animals. I’m so stoked!!
5157 2018-10-24 14:57:25 I don’t think telling people they’re going to lose their jobs is constructive. It makes more sense to be offering current oil/coal employees free education/skills training in the clean energy sector. Don’t tell them they’re losing their jobs. Tell them they have jobs ….
5158 2018-10-24 14:57:24 Bill Clinton was found at their Chappaqua, New York home safe. He was in the Master Bedroom Suite  banging a 22 year oil intern while Hillary is in Flordia campaigning forThe Democratic’s Party.Bill is so excited about Hillary’s new travel arrangements and so are many Republicans

5163 2018-10-24 14:56:11 @realDonaldTrump 

Obama spent 10,000,000,000 giving taxpayers money to Iran solyindra climate change money down the drain.
Destroying our manufacturers and coal energy sectors making us dependent on middle eastern oil. 
Obama made bad deals for America 
@GOP
5164 2018-10-24 14:56:08 You could also be warning people to find another job because the big oil paycheques are not long for this world.
5165 2018-10-24 14:56:06 As long as it’s not a 2010-2012. Some of those years are okay and some burn oil like crazy! My mom has to completely replace her engine in her 2010. Otherwise it’s a great vehicle!

5167 2018-10-24 14:55:41 “Anyone can do an oil change.”
“I want you.”
“Well, I’m on my break, so…”
He didn’t say anything, but his eyes hardened to a sharp point that made my blood sizzle.
I hesitated, the key fob dangling between us. “Everything is a power play with you, isn’t it?”

5168 2018-10-24 14:55:39 Loved doing mini paintings in oil this summer.

5174 2018-10-24 14:55:04 Pakistan gets much needed financial breather from Saudi Arabia. Three billion dollars for balance of payments and 3 billion dollars for deferred oil payments
5175 2018-10-24 14:55:01 Seriously, how in the heck does a parent watch their child suffer (not just my endometriosis, but unvaxxed kids catching preventable illnesses!) and think that their ”ehh who needs medicine when I’ve got essential oil?” beliefs are worth their child’s suffering? It blows my mind!
5176 2018-10-24 14:54:57 Also, grape is not a vegetable. Its a fruit. Grape, avocado, and olive are all fruits. Tell us about fruit seed oil vs vegetable seed oil.
5177 2018-10-24 14:54:54 China has over 200 refineries!!

Are they even oil producing co
5178 2018-10-24 14:54:52 Even if we landed a top WR, it would be like "striking oil in a world that hadn't invented internal combustion." (Ex Machina) Smith wouldn't be able to use them. @granthpaulsen @funnydanny #GrantAndDanny #Redskins
5179 2018-10-24 14:54:28 It is time world leaders finalise and implement electric vehicle policy at the earliest. We cannot keep pleasing the oil giants. It is time to put PLANET EARTH FIRST. Global warming is a reality. We must act when we still have time and hope! @globalwarming #GlobalWarming
5180 2018-10-24 14:54:23 Sask has its own policy.  Taxing and taxing and taxing does nothing for environment just send business down the road to other countries.  Do u feel warm and fuzzy with tie Saudi Arabian oil.

5183 2018-10-24 14:54:04 I'm listening to "the liar"?! That you can worship a snake oil salesman like @realDonaldTrump (btw, Exodus 20:3) and make that statement is absurd.
5184 2018-10-24 14:54:00 I use Charity Pot from Lush, idk if that’s a moisturizer, I know nothing. And then I do a wee bit of rose hip oil.
5185 2018-10-24 14:53:45 Beard oil? Well hello Dr. Fancypants!
5186 2018-10-24 14:53:42 @realDonaldTrump China, India, and no country should be exempted from the oil embargo. I warn you that you will lose everything. If you are exempted, it shows that you are submissive to the Jews and that your work is complete
5187 2018-10-24 14:53:09 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
5188 2018-10-24 14:52:48 Capt,  Perhaps the silver water is the vanishing war paint worn by the Nordics? I have seen this tradition often. Nevertheless, in a vast and empty land, victory is assured! The antler bread provides mental sharpness. The oil, only you know. Steady forward! Land of Lincoln

5195 2018-10-24 14:51:32 We can pump oil from Canada to Houston, but not water from east to west!  Keep boiling your water Austin!
5196 2018-10-24 14:51:30 Honey and Olive oil you nailed it ! And not to forget clear water....if you know what I am saying 
5197 2018-10-24 14:51:25 It is not about the failed cover up. It is about the brutal, savage, Saudi government sponsored murder, torture, and dismembering of a Washington Post journalist. With big oil money come big responsibilities. Saudis still living in the 16th century.
5198 2018-10-24 14:51:25 New crude oil type: Cheapo
5199 2018-10-24 14:51:25 I can’t argue I change my oil every month/500 miles but I have a 42 year old pickup that requires extra love. I don’t have to drive to work so I don’t really rack up miles.
5200 2018-10-24 14:51:25 No ideology is without blood on its hands. Most of the British empire was invadeing countries for profit, some US wars was for oil. Classic Liberalism turned a blind eye to people been worked to death to maximise profits . Name me a belief or ideology that is without a dark side

5203 2018-10-24 14:51:14 The stand-off of the United States and Saudia Arabia on the #Khashoggi case could translate much on the oil and bunkering charges and ultimately affect the freight charges.
5204 2018-10-24 14:51:14 All travelers must comply with federal law on transporting marijuana & cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement if they discover these products while screening.
5205 2018-10-24 14:51:09 In all thy getting have money sorry oil wells.
5206 2018-10-24 14:50:59 One more thing, I do drink  something using some of those things, plus I use another for cleaning the crap off my skin, then soak in Epsom salts, baking soda, sometimes borax,lavender oil in the bath with a seaweed soap. After that I put the same stuff on as before the bath
5207 2018-10-24 14:50:44 Your announced big jump in production did not happen. Since over 20 weeks US production stagnates around 11 mill bpd despite the help of the mature GOM basin, which reported a 100% ( or nearly 400 k bpd) growth of heavy oil over the summer. Something is here basicly wrong.

5211 2018-10-24 14:50:24 Happy Birthday to the National Post. A newspaper owned by an American hedge fund that promotes American gangsta style capitalism and acts as public relations for Big Oil. Always serving  the best interests of Canadians. 20 years of spin and plenty of fake news since its inception
5212 2018-10-24 14:50:21 Large scale economics. Much more expensive to get that oil into supply.

5216 2018-10-24 14:50:16 Has anyone calculated what Canada's oil and gas exports contribute?
5217 2018-10-24 14:50:12 No oil runs through the pipeline he bought. The pipes are sitting on the ground.
5218 2018-10-24 14:50:07 I just returned from getting a few bottles of motor oil at the QFC on 24th Ave NW. I'm doing an oil change on my silver 2000 F150 XL on Friday. I'm getting a new car as soon as I can afford it. Until then, however, my pickup is good enough. They built these F150s to run forever.

5220 2018-10-24 14:49:59 No, the numbers are at least consistent what those exercise machines show you: 1 gallon of oil is 25000 cal, and you use ~50cal / flat km
5221 2018-10-24 14:49:51 Yeah, she doesn’t know crap. Never been to Washington but acts like she knows everything. Don Young ferociously fights for Alaska, and that chick would vote against everything that makes money including oil production. She only wants healthcare, and to tax us to death.
5222 2018-10-24 14:49:43 Crown prince of Bahrain says non-oil growth last year was 5% and oil is 80% of GDP. 75% of gov revenue is from oil #OOTT #FII2018

5231 2018-10-24 14:49:07 Liberator Phase I payback period is <1 year with the majority of the oil produced by 2024. I do not anticipate this report release being a major hurdle to funding. With Liberator online it justifies existing facility dry dock or replacement. Esp. if Phase II is as expected.
5232 2018-10-24 14:49:04 No oil...
5233 2018-10-24 14:49:03 We're talking about a guy who

- hired an oil company CEO as his 1st SoS
- hired a retired neurosurgeon as HUD Secretary
- hired a known foreign Nazi with a pending arrest warrant as his 1st NATSEC advisor

Would it have made any difference if he HAD sent Michael Bolton??
5234 2018-10-24 14:49:02 I’m at the shop for an oil change and they better not come at me with ..... “sir we took at look at ______ and it needs to be replaced”. Just change my oil
5235 2018-10-24 14:48:59 Not much oil honestly. There is more in Texas. I don't buy the oil cartels were in on this one.
5236 2018-10-24 14:48:54 เเกะเเล้วด้วยยขอโทษนะค่าาา
5237 2018-10-24 14:48:51 Still selling Snake Oil !
5238 2018-10-24 14:48:51 The Venezuelan Regime has oil, and valuable resources that give them the power to buy and influence important people everywhere and inside the US ! You can not just capsule it and live with it. One day they will hit the US too hard! Please stop them and intervine!
5239 2018-10-24 14:48:49 Banna you remind me of the conversation I always have with tax owners that they need to 'Own' it. From Oil, fuel, parts, tyres and ultimately the design of finished product as in a Taxi that speaks to their target market but................#AskABoss. Wake up kasi, you worth more
5240 2018-10-24 14:48:47 *we purchase oil from them, I should say.
5241 2018-10-24 14:48:39 A million isn't even close enough to begin to cover the damage they have done.
Praise might come when they give it ALL back and convince the rest of big oil to do the same.
So... Never.
5242 2018-10-24 14:48:38 First it was the oil; now it's the money ...
5243 2018-10-24 14:48:25 Going down because the oil and nat gas are coming down hard. External factors completely cause the price changes in this stock
5244 2018-10-24 14:48:23 For my brethren that can grow beards/ patchy beards I suggest using a quality vitamin E oil.
5245 2018-10-24 14:48:23 Love to visit and appreciate the central coast and oil companies don’t! They see $ wherever they see open pristine land with thriving wildlife. They ruin the landscape and environment and walk away. I hope SLO says YES to ban fracking!
5246 2018-10-24 14:48:16 I used to be addicted to the Rosemary and Olive oil blend.

Yup, cheese makes everything better.

I just bought a hunk of garganzole the size of a car battery!
5247 2018-10-24 14:48:11 It kinda is... if you buy a whole fucking buch of machines to refine the oil and dig it and people come and take it over because its on their territory you would be pissed too. They should have bought it back. Not confiscation.
5248 2018-10-24 14:48:05 งื้อ

5253 2018-10-24 14:47:49 Debotchery taking place outside the States and the palace, where the brothel was know as adnons place to deal the struggles of the day with the mayors and sell guns and drugs, big story about foreign oil coming in and out of Libya for guns to the united states didn't make sense.
5254 2018-10-24 14:47:48 Do you wonder why Nigeria owners PLC are ganging up against PMB Re-election? Oil block is renewable every 20years. Renewal is due for 2019, election is taken place in 2019.

If you know you, you know!
5255 2018-10-24 14:47:36 I am not too much excited about Crude oil going below $75/barrel.
Who knows, it may be a Saudi tactic to appease Trump on the sidelines of #Khashoggi case.
Trump anyway loves transactional diplomacy !
So cant say if its a precursor to a long term trend.
Lets wait & watch.
5256 2018-10-24 14:47:32 Or they may just sit on their oil and use their foreign cash reserves
5257 2018-10-24 14:47:26 Of course for the full experience you'll need to spin the jar round at 1600km/h!

Good luck anyway, hope nobody decides to cut down half the plants and dig for oil whilst you're in there.
5258 2018-10-24 14:47:20 Your Jawahar and MKG were kept in palaces in prison term, do you even remember/know that? Jawahar wrote books in prison terms unlike Savarkar who had to extract 35 litre oil everyday. Do it once, naani yaad aa jaayegi tere ko

5269 2018-10-24 14:45:55 @SquawkStreet @carlquintanilla @davidfaber @SaraEisen @JackieDeAngelis Since it takes about 2 barrels of #wti crude to make 1 barrel of gasoline, so isn't a +6.3mil crude & -4.8mil gasoline EIA inventory actually a NET DRAWDOWN!? #oil #brent
5270 2018-10-24 14:45:54 Jimmy, I get you hate the President and that's fine - most ignorant people do, but new home sales at 3 year low, participation rate 600 basis points lower than 2000, oil prices in the 60's, and car sales slowing - Do some research on why the Fed has to raise above neutral.
5271 2018-10-24 14:45:51 read up on cannabis therapy.  i have a friend getting very good results after a lifetime of trying everything.  read up on weed oil.  i've been doing it for something else for years with results.
5272 2018-10-24 14:45:47 Given that the barrell of oil has dropped nearly US$10 in the last few days, we should surely be putting pressure on the forecourts to lower their prices? #RAC #AA
5273 2018-10-24 14:45:33 house sales down, oilfield industries tanking down, huge imports of crude oil,  dow Jones and all down. Slowly consumers to pay higher for good due to China trade war.  it s not price of gasoline at the pump that will make Republicans elected.

5275 2018-10-24 14:45:26 I genuinely do not know how Norway arranges decommissioning but I am sure they are not doing it for 0% tax. If you know I would be interested in how 1 country makes billions and the other makes nothing on oil 60 bucks above production cost per barrel.

5280 2018-10-24 14:45:00 This is true. But I think expectations were for a less hawkish BoC with CAD oil fetching $20/barrel and a highly indebted consumer - that's why Cad bounced today. I'm not too optimistic for CADUSD over the next 12 months...You?

5289 2018-10-24 14:44:13 Oo it's problematic. People don't need "free" education, they need to be to able to afford QUALITY education. So instead of spending a chunk of our oil money to provide free education why don't you improve the quality, push money into the economy so people can afford good...
5290 2018-10-24 14:44:11 Cette position idéologique sur le nucléaire est tout aussi inacceptable et criminel que les ventes d'armes à #MBS,  aux #Émiratsarabesunis et à l'#Egypte.

2. Pouring oil in your pasta water does NOT stop your noodles from sticking. The oil just sits on the top...

However, strategically how can we afford not to try and work with the state that controls 1) east side of the Red Sea, 2) massive economically sensitive oil reserves 3) Iranian regional hegemony. | Riddle me a moral/ethical fix.
5342 2018-10-24 14:38:57 Awesome
5343 2018-10-24 14:38:53 You mean the change was initiated by iran by taking control of their oil fields? That is provocative
5344 2018-10-24 14:38:44 If you can be bothered you could make your own! I find it quite therapeutic just chopping them all really thin and spraying a low cal oil on them, makes them way more a treat too if you just make them yourself rather than open a convenient packet!

5370 2018-10-24 14:36:28 yo who does oil changes in kzoo 
5371 2018-10-24 14:36:27 EIA oil build was 6.3 mln barrels and nearly twice as large as expected. Prices had just began stabilizing after yesterday's API plunge.  Increase in US inventories and Saudis committed to not weaponizing oil/stepping up output, the backdrop does not appear favorable for prices.
5372 2018-10-24 14:36:25 Several reasons, past and current, seen and unseen, factor in.  
A few of the see-able reasons:
1) Iran was Britain’s oil partner early on, while Saudi Arabia was the US’ (APOC vs ARAMCO). Our main interest in Iran was to thwart Communist expansion. 1/4

5391 2018-10-24 14:34:44 Absolutely. Car dealers have very widely distributed political power, like a kind of corporate grassroots, wielding huge influence in US. But coal, oil, automotive are even bigger (& more global) industries, with comparatively bottomless pockets. What would you do in their place?

5399 2018-10-24 14:34:11 Is America or the "civilized" rest of the world interested? Nope. The rest are interested in cheap oil and making money out of it. Precisely why a Jewish son-in-law of a Christian President is in an un-reforming muslim pocket!
5400 2018-10-24 14:34:09 How the mighty have fallen. The gray haired guy is nodding and the podium looks like one of those boxes carnival barkers carrying around selling snake oil. No Presidential seal no more so nobody cares what #BHO says obviously

5408 2018-10-24 14:33:18 This is what we've come to. Asking the federal government to invest in the most unsafe way to move oil, because they can't get a pipeline built. #backwardsthinking
5409 2018-10-24 14:33:16 I guess we will see, right now oil runs through it and the expansion has the best chance of success if it is done the right way - we'll see if he can do that or not.

5464 2018-10-24 14:29:38 @AValiavska An example of crisis communication would be the BP oil spill in the gulf. BP had to create response advertisements in order to deal with the outraged public. #orgad14 #comm3460

5466 2018-10-24 14:29:27 If they had oil, the US would come in with troops and install a puppet govt. But they are just poor brown people so we apparently just don't give a shit.
5467 2018-10-24 14:29:20 But it doesn't really make sense to give a "fantastic relationship" story as your example of a "con" to going to get an oil change  
5468 2018-10-24 14:29:08 BP/western interests didn’t like the idea of not shamelessly exploiting Iranian oil reserves. 

Considering the continuing destabilization of the US, it already has been disastrous, but it’s a slow collapse.

5516 2018-10-24 14:23:29 That's true, Ive worked in the auto parts industry for the last five years and we have women come in there wanting someone to check their oil, brake fluid, or even antifreeze. Then they say, 'I JUST GET IN THE CAR AND DRIVE" Smmfh
5517 2018-10-24 14:23:18 If real democracy is in play it has a chance. But if money is in politics it hasn’t a chance. It’s never free from corruption but could change with that simple pledge. Oil is our master and the world suffers for it.

5520 2018-10-24 14:22:50 Well, presence of oil and absence of real states in the region, Lobbying and chaos will continue to thrive. If it does happen it will be politically costly for US, Arms deals are not of a high benifit for the US as the importance to have SA as a strong ally there.

5525 2018-10-24 14:21:19 Just went to make my self a sausage bacon and egg sandwich. Burnt the bacon in 10 seconds, sausage wasn’t cooked in middle and egg fell off hob onto floor and hot oil has now burnt my legs and went all over the walls. Fantastic

5534 2018-10-24 14:20:24 Let me sequence yields for you simply:

#crudeoil goes up --> inflation expectations go up --> yields go up

What's happening with #oil? You know.

5536 2018-10-24 14:20:22 That is what we should strive for, but both parties have been horrible at implementing it. If that’s how we actually conducted ourself we would be putting more work into becoming energy independent so we didn’t rely on outside oil and we would find actual solutions to the wars
5537 2018-10-24 14:20:20 Q2 results @IndiGo6E: Costs up 24%, yields down 10%, indicate tough trading conditions & inability to control market dynamics. Don’t see near term improvement. Geopolitical issues & reimposition of sanctions on #Iran oil could trigger further industry downside. #IndianAviation
5538 2018-10-24 14:19:56 Mahn i dont know if id try it again. I hate the taste of raw palm oil. I thought it would be like bread and really spicy beans stew. Was really looking forward to it. Its not that spicy just seemed like beans and palm oil.

5544 2018-10-24 14:19:25 I’ve wondered why the Saudi strategic relationship is important to us anymore.  We don’t need their oil anymore, arms sales is insignificant to our overall economy, and wouldn’t Saudi be with us vs Iran whatever we do?  What choice does Saudi really have?

5576 2018-10-24 14:15:50 This is when the Scottish Government must as a mimimum enter JVs with the oil companies. They will not only get their share of the profits but also the tax associated with it. Moreover an industrial policy that ensures $330b is spent in Scotland.
5577 2018-10-24 14:15:26 Yup pero note also that during PNoy’s time sometime August 2014, price of crude oil hit 110 Usd per barrel. But premium was priced at 42 ps a liter lang. now world price is less than 80 usd a barrel and binebenta ng 58 ps a liter, could u spot the difference?

5590 2018-10-24 14:14:16 In the 2015 election. Trudeau told us carbon pricing (i.e. tax) would give the federal government the 'social licence' to build pipelines to get our oil to global markets.  In 2018, we haven't got the pipelines, but we are getting the carbon price (i.e.) tax? #cdnpoli

5657 2018-10-24 14:07:59 Oh is he selling Saudi oil to them. That makes sense. Selling energy to the E.U.  Oh wait Doug, are we selling them clean coal. Wow, Doug!  I am misinformed. Everyone out there on Twitter, don’t be a Doug!
5658 2018-10-24 14:07:57 Make sure it’s the antiseptic one and not the essential oil. Mix it with a skin safe oil, like coconut oil, before applying. Pure Tea Tree can burn your skin
5659 2018-10-24 14:07:48 blame it on oil ... wala kasing oil ang pilipinas daw kaya wala siyang petroleum jelly na maipahid sa sunburnt area.

5666 2018-10-24 14:07:14 So, are the Republicans going to drop their lawsuits and is Mitch now going to champion the provision of that ACA that  he hates the most?  Sadly, many will buy your snake oil and believe this lie.  #voteblue #VoteThemOut
5667 2018-10-24 14:07:12 @JustinTrudeau blocking the vehicle sale is good.  Ending all oil imports from them is also good.  Building #EnergyEast would make that more than feasible.
5668 2018-10-24 14:07:07 Trade imbalance naman talaga. Bukod sa wala tayong oil reserve, sobrang hina din natin sa production of goods. Agricultural country daw tayo pero mas madami pa import natin na supply. Kaya nga sana mag-focus din tayo sa Agriculture.
5669 2018-10-24 14:06:58 Usually Mincha has 1 log of oil for 1 isaron of flour. But for Todah, more than 6 isarons of flour, for 1/4 log of oil.

5671 2018-10-24 14:06:51 It's just sad that this contry is powered by more than 80% coal, oil and natural gas (stats from 2015). Hope it's gotten cleaner by today.

(And the Trump/Warren drama). (1/2)
5682 2018-10-24 14:06:13 So consumer spending, the cost of commodities, weather, real estate prices and the price of oil have ZERO impact on the rate of inflation.

Your type of stupid bores me.

5684 2018-10-24 14:06:02 And I am not saying that allopathic care is the inherrently better care. I just think anyone who calls themselves a homeopath while preying on peoples emotions is akin to a snake oil sales man, and you should be tried in court for it.

Now, bugger off and go back to school.
5685 2018-10-24 14:05:49 So today marks the first day of "no seed oil diet" or "pre seed oil diet". Meat in abundance and generally speaking traditional food, including refined, made in a way it was done around the world before 1950 roughly. Basically before obesity and cvd epidemic.

5696 2018-10-24 14:04:49 The oil industry is booming everywhere else in the world (except Venezuela) with the highest prices in 3 years. The same can't be said here because of a far left provincial and federal government that wants a 'managed decline' of our #1 industry.

Why ?

There are HOMOSEXUALS running the Political, Education, Religion and Banking systems
5719 2018-10-24 14:03:29 It was fake news. As tempting as it sounded, I'm glad it was fake news. Don't want us to become City or PSG who are owned by 'nations' with blatant human rights violations. We keep mocking City for their oil money.. don't want us to be in the same situation.
5720 2018-10-24 14:03:27 Wonder if it’ll have little red tabs to make oil changes easier.
5721 2018-10-24 14:03:26 Labour logic = Ban fracking but import the gas and oil from fracking in other countries.
5722 2018-10-24 14:03:16 77% of the worlds oil is used for transport. AMZN should build trains!

Hell even Ronald Reagan's attempted murderer was raised Republican lol.   His family were oil tycoons
5726 2018-10-24 14:03:05 It's infuriating as oil companies have made sure that they have a lot of investors interested in their continuing profits, and these companies own a lot of clean energy patents. They're actually prepared to have to change, but won't without being forced.
5727 2018-10-24 14:02:57 I use a neti pot and gargle with warm salt water. Then, i max out a version of emergen-c that has zinc. And I diffuse an essential oil blend meant to ward off sickness (or, can go with peppermint, orange, clove, and cinnamon.) Helps me avoid it.  Feel better soon!
5728 2018-10-24 14:02:55 This still does not give the government licence to proceed with its fossil fuel agenda of expanded oil sands & LNG production and deep sea drilling.
5729 2018-10-24 14:02:53 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.

5733 2018-10-24 14:02:43 Corporations are making market decisions to bring in the lowest cost and appropriate quality oil for their refineries and the demand.  Energy East would not have changed that fact. So it's not a matter of semantics.  Try googling Irving Oil and Energy East.

5739 2018-10-24 14:01:43 Good Luck Cayden Buysse at National FFA Convention as he competes in Fiber oil and crop production. Cayden was selected as one of the top four people in the nation and will be competing for first place on Thursday in Indianapolis.
5740 2018-10-24 14:01:43 Wheeler praised the oil/gas industry: "“We’re producing more energy than ever before thanks to the hard work and ingenuity of the people here in this room today." Gross. We need a rapid and just transition to 100% renewables by 2030.
5741 2018-10-24 14:01:30 Wake up, rub vitamin E all over my body, coconut oil on my ass and hair, drink lots of water and mind my DAMN BUSINESS ! 
5742 2018-10-24 14:01:28 economy doesn't work based on this idiots projection. Economy is like well oil engine, which requires investment, constant growth in demand, and great export of products and favorite env , infrastructure .  None of them is available in pak.
5743 2018-10-24 14:01:28 We feel that the oil spill IS the story, not WaPo's characterization of the severity of the leak. We do not see the news value of of your takeaway comments at the end of the segment hence the #fakenews crack. FWIW it was tongue in cheek.

5745 2018-10-24 14:01:14 Maybe. But then you'd probably need more synthetic fertilizers made from oil... Manure is good stuff! Another idea is to integrate livestock & crops. Example: chickens are great at eating bugs off vegetables.

5775 2018-10-24 13:59:27 Ecuador is being "governed" by the corrupt elites and US allies. The gov. fooled the people into referendum where one of the questions was related to the petroleum explotation. They sold the ecuadorean people the idea that the oil fields would be small and woul not contaminate.

5778 2018-10-24 13:59:19 OIL: Oil slipped to around $76 a barrel paring losses after hitting its lowest since late August, pressured by concern that demand is weakening and supply ample even as U.S. sanctions loom on oil exporter Iran.

5784 2018-10-24 13:58:44 What's funny is they actually think they are bad asses. They probably never even fired a gun. Here in West Virginia we we are practically born with a gun in our hands and use gun oil instead of baby oil! 
5785 2018-10-24 13:58:41 In all seriousness, the soil around gas stations tends to be severely contaminated. I wouldn't consume anything grown on their premises.

Bring back the draft & oil wars end tomorrow.
5788 2018-10-24 13:58:25 My guess is we will get inventories as high as yesterday. Lower oil prices trigger a massive import wave, which increases also inventories.

5793 2018-10-24 13:57:42 A lot of my friends are core BJP supporters. Almost all are saying that they will stay at home in 2019. Now if BJP loses both Raj & MP in the coming then this is also going to add to the disenchantment. Not to forget oil prices + inflation + unemployment.

5796 2018-10-24 13:57:14 One thing I do miss about dad not being here, is having to deal with garages! Been here an hour, he'd have had the oil and filter changed 30 minutes ago! I'm told to expect it back 4/4.30pm 
5797 2018-10-24 13:57:09 Local is cheaper if  from those companies that get allocations from the RBZ.A 2L bottle f cooking oil is priced at around ZAR30 in SA this is the equivalent of about US$8 if funds are sourced at parallel rates to import it.Local cooking oil is US$3.80 per 2L so no contest.

5801 2018-10-24 13:56:47 Rupee has gained almost rupees 2 and international oil has lost 4 dollars. How much has been the reduction in petrol and diesel prices
5802 2018-10-24 13:56:47 Sesame oil is tolerable in small amounts. Even I add a smidgen to the pan for fried rice.
5803 2018-10-24 13:56:47 Slightly concerned. Advisory on the Alfa is the nearside shock absorber which has a misting of oil.
Replaced these less than 3000 miles ago. 
Something is not right.

But she often told me that she dropped a bottle of baby oil on my head. Finally I realized she needed closure. I said I’m fine mom

5807 2018-10-24 13:55:59 But bhai hamari 60%electricity Bhi tu furnace oil par banti hai. Electricity Zayda use hogi tab Bhi import bill bhary Ga. So baut farq nahi pharny wala import bill me.

5811 2018-10-24 13:55:38 Trump can and will say anything. He is the antithesis of a president.
Drunk on his own popularity he will lie to get votes, insult anyone who dares oppose him and cajole millions into thinking he is not a snake oil salesman.
5812 2018-10-24 13:55:37 Boycott Saudi straight away. We all know why our govt don’t! ### oil and money. Saudi Arabia and Israel both racist state and need to become civilised before we treat them in a civilised way
5813 2018-10-24 13:55:26 my dad came out to check my oil this morning when I was leaving but I told him I’d just checked it over the weekend and I thought he was gonna faint.. poor guy has no faith in me

5816 2018-10-24 13:55:06 My car goes 5k without an oil change so it evens out as far as price
5817 2018-10-24 13:54:56 Sinopec Group and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), the country's top state-owned refiners, have not made any nominations to load Iranian oil for November because of concerns they would be violating U.S. sanctions,

5819 2018-10-24 13:54:30 Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said at an investment conference in Riyadh that the oil market was in a "good place" and he hoped oil producers would sign a deal in December to extend cooperation to monitor and stabilise prices.
5820 2018-10-24 13:54:19 Yeah, she's got two dogs now that have cancer. Watching how close we are to human biological-immortality, you just know that people are going to be slipping it to their pets, haha. They're on CBD oil and pred, doing surprisingly well...except for the excessive urination.
5821 2018-10-24 13:54:19 Facebook needs to remove it
5822 2018-10-24 13:54:17 Saudi Arabia said on Tuesday it would continue to meet customer demand for crude despite looming U.S. sanctions that are expected to reduce oil exports from Iran.
5823 2018-10-24 13:54:11 This picture I could see hanging over a massive fireplace.  Absolutely beautiful photo that I could see transformed into a gorgeous oil painting.
5824 2018-10-24 13:54:10 And thank God I do. I had to get an oil change 1200 miles early bc I think they didn’t put the right oil in my car. Lesson learned tho. I’m back going to the dealership for my oil changes.
5825 2018-10-24 13:54:07 Fireworks expected this session. CAD rate decision, BOC press conference, Crude Oil Inventories, FOMC members speak 
5826 2018-10-24 13:54:07 Larsson had a couple wobbly moments last night, but nothing too crazy.

25/4 had a rough night. No sugar coating it.
5827 2018-10-24 13:53:49 Goggles on his eyes he closed a tear in one of the fuel tanks before setting the welder aside. He turned around in the chair and looked up at her, some dirt and oil being smeared on his pants.

5828 2018-10-24 13:53:49 I assure you greed has nothing to do with it! The cuts of meat we use are premium and as such v. expensive. The cost of all our ingredients, like our new buns, peanut oil, etc. are v. high, which made the increase 100% necessary. We hope you can understand.

5830 2018-10-24 13:53:32 Got a new car because my old one had an oil leak, well my new car has a leak too! Took it to get fixed yesterday, and it’s still leaking apparently!!! I quit
5831 2018-10-24 13:53:17 its a f*cking disaster, one of the most unloved share on AIM. It has an oil producing asset and its share price is a fraction of 1p, says a lot about the useless pr*ck of a CEO that runs it.
Ditto for MYN
5832 2018-10-24 13:53:16 I just dropped my Van off at the dealership to have my engine replaced. I hope this new engine doesn't burn through as much oil as the original... glad it is still under warranty too!
5833 2018-10-24 13:53:11 Decades ago my dad told me about an Uncle of his that cheated his “Nana” out of oil shale rich property in Colorado Springs. Boy am I glad we didn’t inherit into that #fracking nightmare!

5835 2018-10-24 13:53:03 #DidYouKnow dandruff is mostly caused by a fungi known as Malassezia. Due to excess oil, this often gets instigated and causes flaking of the scalp, also known as dandruff. #DrKSays #BoldAsBlack

5840 2018-10-24 13:52:27 It's the same thing all over the developed world.

Giant western corporations employ, recruit and manufacture in poor countries, sell their shit at home and make a fortune but base themselves somewhere else and pay no tax.

Point being globalisation helps nobody.

5842 2018-10-24 13:52:01 & how about @Justintrudeau building & approving Energy East pipelines so Canadians can use our own ethical oil instead of Saudi & other rabid Islamists' oil? Pipeline east is far more enviro. clean than trucks or ships across Atlantic. Trudeau is all talk, no sense!

5845 2018-10-24 13:51:42 It's a good star. The heating oil thing myself and @gordlittle discussed yesterday. I think its more in use by lower income households (no data btw, just an educated guess). But Gord was right in saying that these people would need rebate/grant help form gov to accelerate change.
5846 2018-10-24 13:51:38 Pence has had Russian $$ interests in oil&backed by Koch bros.for many years! Pence Is a"lesser strength version"of Charlatan,Con Man,Trump.
5847 2018-10-24 13:51:36 It certainly is frustrating times - both politically and environmentally. The EU is forging ahead with banning some single use plastic. Wish they would just ban the whole lot and stop feeding the invisible oil spill.
5848 2018-10-24 13:51:28 Wheeler says the EPA will no longer target specific sectors like the oil & gas industry and instead focus on non-attainment areas.
5849 2018-10-24 13:51:20 Then again at my job, people ask for endless free bread, run you different times for oil or butter, we box up your food for you, plus run however many refills some of you weirdos be throwing back, and carry heavy ass plates on trays to pre bus tables. You should step in the shoes
5850 2018-10-24 13:51:16 $XOP on lows while oil near highs. I challenge anyone to find a more busted sector
5851 2018-10-24 13:51:12 It all boils down to oil since we are just buying it from the middle east. If they move the prices higher, what can we do? We just have to buy it because we need it for everything (food, transportation, agriculture etc, etc.) only way is to have nuclear power & own oil production
5852 2018-10-24 13:51:09 Sidewinder keeps shutting off while mowing. Not overheating, oil & hydro levels are fine. It'll start up now and shut off after a few seconds.  Cuts off quick so it doesnt seem like it's a fuel issue. Ideas?

5856 2018-10-24 13:50:50 America isn’t engaged in any charity project here. Israel is a strategic ally and prevents hostile regimes from artificially inflating the price of oil, through embargo’s  and ensures the maritime flow through the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Aden and the Suez Canal.
5857 2018-10-24 13:50:43 Equipment? Dude, my mom made them in a pot filled with oil, put to boil on the burner.
5858 2018-10-24 13:50:36 Chef, everybody knows lasagna cooks best over an oil drum filled with gas and wood 
5859 2018-10-24 13:50:27 Anyone that doesn't belive in CC should do the same only with barrels of oil and plastic products see how long they last.
5860 2018-10-24 13:50:25 Dude / that’s a goaltending issue. If we flip goalies, the Oil wins that game 10-2.
5861 2018-10-24 13:50:13 Can't think of a better way to accelerate EV adoption. Impt tax can be set such that loss in govt rev is offset by +ve impact on trade deficit (oil consumption over life of an avg car), reduced carbon footprint (unpriced externality) and increased profit from electricity sales
5862 2018-10-24 13:49:57 そうじゃなきゃ1時間で30も来ないです(´･_･`)
5863 2018-10-24 13:49:54 No, I defend market-based decisions. I’m not the person advocating for a national energy program where domestically produced oil is first used to supply domestic consumption. I do find it a bit ironic that you’re living in YYC and advocating for a NEP.

5875 2018-10-24 13:48:36 Not a word form "no proof lying trump" about the typhoon about to hit the U. S. Territory of Guam. Or what about the huge oil spill in the gulf of Mexico by one of his buddies oil companies.
5876 2018-10-24 13:48:33 Knew she wouldnt. How can she when theyve been allowed to buy up  so much, and control the oil  Disgraceful

I also understand that methane emissions from oil/gas industry operations are the leading (human-caused) source of GHG pollution in the U.S., and 2nd worldwide

5885 2018-10-24 13:47:18 Agreed. Take the point, go 2-2-0 in the last four and you end up at .500 for the month with 11 points. I think that's a win considering schedule. I also think the Oil arep laying well right now and will eventually be rewarded. A lot to like early.

5887 2018-10-24 13:47:09 I do a honey, garlic meal. Just cut up the chicken into small cubes, then add four tablespoons of honey, some garlic minced. (I use garlic powder), 2tablespoons of soy sauce and red paper flakes (optional) and fry it on the stove with some olive oil. 
5888 2018-10-24 13:46:56 Hopefully, by 2050 Total and all other big Oil won’t be around and the answer to that question won’t even be applicable.

5923 2018-10-24 13:43:54 This is 3 seconds of a 20 minutes interview. He was talking about stoping oil production, not the carbon tax. This is @jkenney and his Tory friends starting their propaganda. If you are scare of the facts, don’t show them.

5929 2018-10-24 13:43:24 When you go for an oil change and they be like “your car needs new brakes, 2 tires and some other fuck shit” your total was $33 now it will be $467 ... me: print what it needs I’ll get a 2nd opinion .. thanks.
5930 2018-10-24 13:43:18 War is to the 21st century what oil was to the 20th; the pillar that supports the global economy.
5931 2018-10-24 13:43:08 @narendramodi sir please give relif to public in oil prices and take strong decisions to win 2019 by showing your current power. See india issues at priority at world level and increase revenue from super rich and give relif to poors and take very big decisions in next 3 months.

5935 2018-10-24 13:42:40 You must say vegan to be on safer side. if you say vegetarian outside, they may include eggs and give you veggies cooked in animal oil.
5936 2018-10-24 13:42:31 Apparently, no one is doing anything. Taylor Energy went out of business. Shocked that they covered this up. Well, um, no, it’s not shocking, is it? Big Oil and its Republican supporters are complicit; I’m sure they’ve known all along, protecting each other and their big payoffs.

5938 2018-10-24 13:42:27 The Clinton's and Obama have disempowered nations,  financed coups and military overthrows, and endorsed the assassinations of oil producing nations, armed terrorists, promoted dissention & starvation, and is the root of immigration crises all over the damn world.
5939 2018-10-24 13:42:25 While reading for class, I check for updates on oil/gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) & remember that the ban on drilling was lifted by Congress in December 2017 as part of the tax bill (thanks to Murkowski). FWS employees trying to slow implementation.
5940 2018-10-24 13:42:19 our country is slave of crude oil....we need to be dependent on our self to develop our economy...
5941 2018-10-24 13:42:15 Under PDP, per barrel of oil was sold for $140 yet our foreign reserve was drained from $62 billion to $26 billion.. 
Under APC, per barrel of oil is sold for $40 and our foreign reserves has increased from $26 billion to $50 billion. 

My fellow Nigerians, pls let us be wise..
5942 2018-10-24 13:42:13 Thank Trump for the silence about the oil spill.

5947 2018-10-24 13:41:36 I've been here listening to several long winded, detailed conversations in the lobby for the past 2 hours waiting for a freaking oil change & rotation/balance. I would have been in and out within 30 at no appt at precision tune...dealership never again.
5948 2018-10-24 13:41:34 it is bcos we hv short-sighted leaders in #GHANA

5949 2018-10-24 13:41:28 Bringing an oil painting I finished legit a 10:30 last night to school was probably a bad idea. Not excited to take it out of its bag and see the smudges  it’s nothing fancy but still.

5952 2018-10-24 13:41:23 I have seen people eating food cooked from Coconut oil generally obese. Lack of physical activity may be the cause?
5953 2018-10-24 13:41:21 since i fucklessly dyed my hair last it’s had the texture of a decorative bale of hay. last night i did a coconut oil treatment and now i can best describe my hair’s texture as “suspiciously soft”. 

that’s all for now, peasants.

5957 2018-10-24 13:41:12 Buckley’s is the best. It’s what I use when oil of oregano, propolis spray and cold fx fail me.
5958 2018-10-24 13:41:08 If you have access, get Oil of Oregano, drop it further in your tongue and wash it down with any beverage, preferably a hot one. It works. Get well. Flu is inevitable

5962 2018-10-24 13:40:53 Not at all.  Just saying that not all immigrants cut lawns & clean houses. I'm pretty sure those who are successful came here legally.
5963 2018-10-24 13:40:50 What i know is that technology is accelerating so fast and with incredible velocities. The money invested in industry is too much and the time it takes to get the investment back is too long... lots of things will have become obsolete... even oil.

5972 2018-10-24 13:39:49 So I called @CanadianTire service this morning...
The guy answers the phone and I go "yes I need an oil change" 
his response "how can I help you with that?" 
Ohhhh I don't know... perhaps by booking me an appointment???
5973 2018-10-24 13:39:45 As a consumer, choosing brands that use certified sustainable palm oil is a way to address deforestation and extinction of endangered species. Industry leaders and NGOs will come together to discuss deforestation-free palm oil in Sabah next month, join conversations using #RT16.
5974 2018-10-24 13:39:37 Let's see how much oil floods the market b4 all nations look the other way and don't hold Saudi's responsible.
5975 2018-10-24 13:39:33 If we vote yes on prop 112 schools will lose a lot of funding because schools are largely funded by oil and gas jobs.

5977 2018-10-24 13:39:17 Fracking in SLO will never make the US oil independent. Nothing will. A good paying job is worth seeking, so maybe pack up your truck a go where water tables are not an issue. Or get into solar power, hair cutting, dog grooming, weed, etc.
5978 2018-10-24 13:39:12 My mom asked me what I wanted for my bday and I flat out told her an oil pen
5979 2018-10-24 13:39:07 Yes - about that - people I've met from Victoria lecture me endlessly because I worked for an oil company in Alberta. Their eyes just kind of glaze over when I mention that their city dumps sewage in the ocean. They say a new sewage plant is in the works....some day.
5980 2018-10-24 13:39:05 No shit. Hahaha that tweet didn’t age very well

5987 2018-10-24 13:38:32 We don't look for investors, only partners.

We provide the design and management - staffing - training for outdoor production facilities with greenhouses for propagation, + the industrial scale oil refineries to match.

You provide the land, project funding, local Gov approvals.

5990 2018-10-24 13:38:23 Bullshit.  Erdogan will look the other way if the Saudis pay him enough.  The Saudis will not be held accountable for this.  They're never held accountable.  As long as the world runs on oil, they never will be held accountable.
5991 2018-10-24 13:38:20 I’m getting really into olives at the moment.

Do you know what kind of olives the oil is pressed from? Or is it a mix?

How can customer prevent coil burn-out?

It is all YOUR problem. YOU have to solve them.

Spend some money on quality parts not on hi-fi ads.
5997 2018-10-24 13:37:06 We are anyway without the oil . Let us just get on with Indy and then the oil is a bonus !

6001 2018-10-24 13:36:34 Republicans have a blindspot (oil induced) for members of the Saudi royal family who were funding Al Qaada.

6004 2018-10-24 13:36:22 You can also cook with extra virgin olive oil, just stir the food !
6005 2018-10-24 13:36:14 Wow, Do we really think that revoking visas will hurt the saudis - No, the way to hurt them is to stop buying oil which eventually would make them a 3rd World country, but we wont do that will we LMAO

6025 2018-10-24 13:33:36 We’re recruiting. We’re looking for an experienced oil markets reporter to join our editorial team in London. For a full job description, please contact hr@energyintel.com
6026 2018-10-24 13:33:26 Exactly my point. Leads and lags are why oil markets always over-shoot on supply. Money is committed based on price/capital supply. It is spent later & production comes even later. By then, balances may have changed.
6027 2018-10-24 13:33:25 We can buy our own oil. Or we can buy foreign oil. 

Your desire to defend the Saudi supply chain is half baked logic.

6030 2018-10-24 13:33:14 Yes, and I still question how that’s working. There has to be seepage at some point. Further, there are whole townships in se SK where it’s barely fit for cattle pasture from mining coal and few oil companies are doing anything about cleaning up old unusable well sites.

Prof Alex Kemp + Dr Linda Stephen, Aberdeen Univ. suggest production could be 14.8 bn barrels of oil equiv from 2018-50

6036 2018-10-24 13:32:26 Where is the condemnation from your POTUS for Saudi‘s action? There was condemnation of the arrest of @samarbadawi15 by Canada, but no word from USA. Did USA decide to stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia? No, because your POTUS seem to be too dependent on Saudi oil and Saudi money
6037 2018-10-24 13:32:17 US transportation is hooked on oil. Yet another reason to electrify our transportation system (in addition toe jobs it would create and the decreased GHGs).

If the pipeline was viable the oil companies would have kept it.
They can see the future and they did the math.
More welfare for the oil industry.
6056 2018-10-24 13:30:29 Outsiders love to look at the anointing, and blessings in your life, and desire what you have. They do this without considering the cost of the oil in your alabaster box. Remain constantly focused on God's Divine Purpose over all else.
6057 2018-10-24 13:30:29 I use Beard oil, Argan Oil I think. Just need to find a good comb.
6058 2018-10-24 13:30:29 Weird, because globally scientists say it's very real. The only scientists who say it's not are paid by oil companies... 

Is it normal for Republicans to expect simple answers for complicated issues? Yup there it is! I figured out why Republicans are wrong so frequently.
6059 2018-10-24 13:30:28 my mom said she can make you a separate masa with just vegetable oil instead of the manteca and she said she can make beans and cheese or corn queso and the chili
6060 2018-10-24 13:30:27 What happens in Europe is fault of you and Netanyahu, both of you enjoy bombing middle east countries to steal their oil and displace people
6061 2018-10-24 13:30:25 you may have to supplement with these each time you make an oil change too.
6062 2018-10-24 13:30:24 Dissolvable solphadine was the best for me but it only eased it then I tried Hemp/CBD oil, 4 drops under your tongue if you can get your hands on some that worked for me had the best sleep of my life  Take both and you'll be flying 
6063 2018-10-24 13:30:15 Dude probably would need to get cobwebs off his dull mangina and oil and service it next time a female considers him, no action in years he gotta beef Tiwa for his demise... sex starved chihuahua

6065 2018-10-24 13:29:58 Is it better to use #coal, #oil or #nuclear energy ? Don't think so... So we must use more and more renewable energy... including #wood ! #bioenergy @CenusaBioenergy @bioenergyEU
6066 2018-10-24 13:29:44 Always comb.  Always oil.

6072 2018-10-24 13:29:20 Why Pakistan has not established oil refinery out of 30000 loan. Where is that money?
6073 2018-10-24 13:29:19 Thanks friend. Yeah, I almost never use coconut oil hahaha
6074 2018-10-24 13:29:15 There would be no cars, trains, skyscrapers, tall buildings, oil rigs, large bridges, logging, firemen :), etc.
Women generally won’t do dangerous jobs - they're too smart for that!
The good thing is there would be no wars.

6076 2018-10-24 13:29:07 FTP used to be an oil additive.  Techies know it as File Transfer Protocol.  Today it means F*ck The Polls.  Are we way up?  Is the R Team gaining ground?

6077 2018-10-24 13:29:05 I thought you said you are a pastor sir??Oga sahara oil and gas!!
6078 2018-10-24 13:29:01 A valid semantic point that side steps the issue that a lot of oil in Canada is imported from Saudi Arabia and the Middle East.

6081 2018-10-24 13:28:39 Lower crude oil prices could reduce under-recoveries of public sector  oil marketing companies (PSU OMCs) on domestic sale of LPG and kerosene  at controlled prices. The government has already freed pricing of petrol  and diesel.
6082 2018-10-24 13:28:38 งันมาร้าน มาช่วยเปลี่ยนโปรมาาาาา
6083 2018-10-24 13:28:32 Shares of three state-run oil marketing companies jumped after crude oil  futures edged lower. HPCL (up 7.16%), Indian Oil Corporation (up 5.54%)  and BPCL (up 4.74%), edged higher.
6084 2018-10-24 13:28:27 It's not a prediction. It's what data suggests. 
I honestly don't see what my investments have to do with what I post on twitter. 
I am a geologist. I drill and produce oil wells. Is that enough "skin" for you?
6085 2018-10-24 13:28:24 Girl at work said it kills feels like when oil spits at you from a frying pan but constant and you can still see hers
6086 2018-10-24 13:28:23 Maybe Lukaku needs engine oil
6087 2018-10-24 13:28:21 my mom gave me like a container of coconut oil for my face

6089 2018-10-24 13:28:17 Yeah exactly, I mean I LOVE the oil fields scene, especially the image of her pushing out of the water but that scene really made the family story worth it for me, I also love how neither of the two of them are really in the wrong, they both have legitimate reasons.
6090 2018-10-24 13:28:15 So much better for your skin too. I love my coconut oil. I use it on my body and cook with it daily!
6091 2018-10-24 13:28:14 @RepSwalwell I hope you & DEMS are getting SUBPOENAS READY TO GO. Please don’t forget the Red Tide caused by deregulation & that oil spill in Gulf that’s been ongoing for years.

6095 2018-10-24 13:27:50 i mean coconut oil
6096 2018-10-24 13:27:27 LOL, I explained what EU is planning is imposing an Oil-for-food program for Iran to keep mullahs in and it was a scheme to plunder money unlawfully under the UN scheme, something the EU is expert in. hope this helps.
6097 2018-10-24 13:27:16 Yes 3billion for BOP crisis and 3for oil payments
6098 2018-10-24 13:27:08 How much of Venezuela’s current state of affairs could be attributed to The Oil Cartel’s actions in late 2014 to drive down the price of oil? I’m late to the conversation but hoping to pick up some context.

6101 2018-10-24 13:26:59 We've been in bed with Saud since big oil in the 60s & 70s.  To immediately drop the petro dollar and Saud ties would collapse the entire U.S. (Private Fed Reserve) Dollar instantly and we'd all be fucked.  Must abandon Zionist Fed note & Petro dollar wisely.
6102 2018-10-24 13:26:55 Wait until we have global caravans of people migrating to escaping the warming climate.National boundaries will be irrelevant. Think a few folks leaving their assigned zone like this is a dystopic movie is bad? Keep burning that oil, this gets worse #caravan

It might change your mindset about Crude Oil. Talks of how Saudi gave America a blank cheque to build Saudi. Saudi was making sales of $33m daily on crude oil
6159 2018-10-24 13:22:33 Alberta has remained highly competitive and has begin to diversify its economy. The key problem is that the US controls a large part of our oil sands and is resistant to (and the primary opposition to) shipping our oil abroad and being competitive on the world market.
6160 2018-10-24 13:22:33 There's one time I tried, my face shined all day  I looked like I was dipped in oil. But maybe it's because I didn't dilute it.

6182 2018-10-24 13:20:17 Fuel prices? Exchange rate? Imports? Standard of living?no of fraud use of fuel in power generation. Every thing is related. Globally prices of variables and variations of oil importing nations? It's not small research but it's a very big sensation prise rise.

6187 2018-10-24 13:19:25 To be accurate you can use the term tracking Iran oil “delivery”. Export is a different story 
China might not buy any oil in Nov, but Iran might still discharge & store unsold oil in the storages in China in Nov & then sell some of it to India in Jan. Export to China in Nov=0.
6188 2018-10-24 13:19:24 About 50 oil blocks licenses will be over by 2019 and these crooks knows PMB might never renew it for them. They want to kill him, or bring themselves back to power so that they can continue using their licenses. God forbid. The oil blocks will be taken away from them all
6189 2018-10-24 13:19:24 I think they are viable now. It’s oil and gas that refuse to move towards green energy. But that bubble will burst and I think it will be sooner than we all realize. Proactive not reactive is the candidate I vote for.
6190 2018-10-24 13:19:19 Cannot. Kelantan's oil money is for penang dap gomen to build its 47b ptmp. And for friends of dap in the undersea tunnel scam.
6191 2018-10-24 13:19:18 He needed the economic sanctions to be lowered and his oil bought at higher prices. He has gotten the price rise. And the Rosneft deal was a bail out to his collapsing government. Trump helped him stay in power and made Russia stronger.

6196 2018-10-24 13:18:49 I truly appreciate the fact that president Trump is not motivated by foreign oil & recognizes the importance of sustaining ourselves as much as possible. He battles using commerce which is refreshing, forces ppl to actually talk.
6197 2018-10-24 13:18:38 I'm not making a value judgment about Venezuela. I'm just making the point that oil production doesn't tell us anything about "socialism."
6198 2018-10-24 13:18:37 If people who vote for trump fall for this snake oil salesman, they deserve what they get. But the majority of this country that hates trump doesn’t deserve to suffer. We know he’s a liar.

6201 2018-10-24 13:18:23 Absolutely delighted to have bought a few more #SDX below 50p . Very excited to see q3 results - cash generation at a higher price of oil and $'s in the bank.
6202 2018-10-24 13:18:19 They nationalized some extractive industry like oil extraction.
6203 2018-10-24 13:18:19 3rd day with CBD oil, my anxiety would stop me from speaking my mind because how others would perceive me. Now I can’t stop getting smart

6205 2018-10-24 13:18:13 you have to distinguish between:
- Crude
- Total liquids
- Barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) 
The lower number is CRUDE only. The higher number is BOE, I think.
6206 2018-10-24 13:18:02 Climate and energy. The energy from shale gas and oil has thus far outpaced the growth of US renewables' contribution.
6207 2018-10-24 13:18:02 Rupee strengthened sharply against the US Dollar today due to fall in crude oil prices. Also, Dollar sales likely for FPIs, exporters supported the sentiment. However, Dollar purchases by oil importers limited potential gains.

6210 2018-10-24 13:17:46 Government bond prices ended higher today. However, some gains were pared as market players booked profit after today's sharp rise in bond prices. Fall in crude oil prices pacified the fear of domestic inflation heading higher and concerns of higher current account deficit.
6211 2018-10-24 13:17:40 lol my car has no wiper fluid and has needed an oil change for about two weeks now, so that’s how my life going
6212 2018-10-24 13:17:40 Speaking of money leaving the province, let's talk about who really owns the oil sands and where that money is going. 71% of the oil sands is foreign controlled thanks to years of the PC's writing blank cheques for anyone willing to plant a flag on what is Canada's resource.
6213 2018-10-24 13:17:40 They are panel beating the country into nationhood but oil and water can not be mixed together. Diametrically opposed values. #FailedProject
6214 2018-10-24 13:17:38 Those who would give up essential Baguette, to purchase a little temporary The Boondocks, deserve neither Saliva nor Oil heater.
6215 2018-10-24 13:17:30 Indian equities ended higher today after four consecutive days of fall, as the Rupee touched a three-week high amid falling crude oil prices. Gains in financial services and metal stocks pushed the markets higher, however some losses in pharma stocks limited the upside.

6218 2018-10-24 13:17:24 Update: I might need a component that is "the price of oil" as well, since all the mining seems to correlate with it significantly.
6219 2018-10-24 13:17:21 Okay, will the city be subsidizing alternatives for those of us on oil heat, or who have horrible public transit options?  Maybe you can help cover the difference to get an electric car.

6221 2018-10-24 13:17:12 Democrats are the only reason pre-existing conditions are covered. They passed the law and they fought the GOP and you every time you tried to repeal it. Sell your snake oil somewhere else! #LyinTrump
6222 2018-10-24 13:17:04 Working nights, 4 shifts in, can’t sleep during the day, hungry, want home fries... get everything ready, get oil heating, finish making fries and WOOOOF! Pot of fire on the stove, melted my little stereo speakers, greasy smoke damaged to walls, ceiling...  lots of screaming
6223 2018-10-24 13:16:35 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
6224 2018-10-24 13:16:31 It's oil, it's wheat, it's soil, it's meat, it's beef!

6232 2018-10-24 13:16:05 Check the facts, & quit deluding yourself. Solar & wind are NOT yet economical competitive w/o taxpayer subsidies, & are NOT yet practical as substitutes for oil & gas in huge numbers of uses and locations domestically and around the world. May the day come when you’re not wrong.
6233 2018-10-24 13:16:03 I used to like Ricky ponting. Now I can't stand him. He earned millions of dollars from cricket. Now he makes even more money peddling misery advertising more ways to extract as much money from  
  gullible and weak people. What next little Ricky? Booze,prostitution snake oil ?
6234 2018-10-24 13:15:39 You should probably discuss this with Trudeau who purchased a pipeline to export oil from Alberta.
6235 2018-10-24 13:15:38 I really need to get an oil change I went waaaaaaaaay over the mileage I was supposed to
6236 2018-10-24 13:15:35 You need to cut back on the snake oil you brought from #45. Those millions of jobs are people who are already working getting 2nd and 3rd jobs to pay their bills. My increase was $7 a month, get some facts.
6237 2018-10-24 13:15:31 People of the country, president Trump thinks you are fools!. This lie tells us who he really is. Win at all costs!! An evil snake oil salesman!

6244 2018-10-24 13:15:00 I recall a few analysts mocking Trump and calling for 100 oil who are silent now as their wrong calls have vanished into a black hole oil well.
6245 2018-10-24 13:14:55 @JustinTrudeau needs to put his money where his mouth is. Stop flying around in a jet, stop travelling in polluting gas emissions cars, stop buying Saudi oil, invest in green companies (not bombardier, GM, Ford). If a #carbonTAX will fix the climate, KEEP the MONEY and do it!

6248 2018-10-24 13:14:33 @AValiavska An example of when crisis rhetoric is neccesarg would be the BP oil spill when millions of gallons of oil were dumped into the Gulf of Mexico. #OrgAd14

6287 2018-10-24 13:10:49 For sure you have a point there. In the case of WTI the downside is more problematic as near 60 shale starts to reduce the pace of growth and that is pretty much the only major new source of oil.

6317 2018-10-24 13:08:21 Very insightful. It seems the EU wants to start another Oil-for-Food Programme which they did in Iraq, to keep a weak but highly aggressive and reactionary regime in place all so that the EU can ensure control.  EU wants to keep Mullahs in, US out - all about control of Oil/Gas.
6318 2018-10-24 13:08:18 The planning began when oil was 100$/barrel years ago! Most schedule activities, appointments etc, to save on fuel costs and most importantly their free time. Nothing new here. Thats your typical family week!
6319 2018-10-24 13:08:09 Part of what's so disturbing about CGEP is Bordoff sanctimoniously lamenting our lack of progress on climate change - but also that fracking harms can be mitigated, and oil demand keeps growing!!. What mental gyrations does he employ to avoid the cognitive dissonance?
6320 2018-10-24 13:08:07 The label should read, “cheaper, cleaner, higher octane, harmful to engines not true” creates American jobs, reduces dependence on foreign oil—celebrate with some coffee & donuts inside

6330 2018-10-24 13:07:13 Well you actually may be unable to judge that way, the major thing that Bayelsa has is the oil and they are literally not in charge of it,  unlike Ebonyi that has a record of generating wealth from farming.

6368 2018-10-24 13:03:03 Canola, corn, soybean, grapeseed, safflower, peanut, palm, cottonseed & vegetable oils should all be avoided. They’re highly processed, prone to being GMO & contribute to inflammation. Coconut oil, avocado oil & grass-fed ghee are best for cooking due to their higher smoke points

Then after that.. Make sure you don't have fuel in your oil or coolant. Cause there is the potential for a leak

6388 2018-10-24 13:01:40 Unsaturated fats can be found in nuts, seeds, avocado, olive oil, and fish. Choose to make unsaturated fats the primary type of fat you eat.

6403 2018-10-24 13:00:17 The housing market crash can be traced all the way back to Carter and the Community Reinvestment Act. Bush and Obama ran up the debt with bailouts and wars, and Obama also stymied growth in the oil and gas industry which is thriving again under Trump.

6460 2018-10-24 12:55:01 KSA support ISIS, both financially and morally. It's a Sunni (KSA) v Shia (Iran) conflict that we (led by the US) are involving ourselves in. What the net benefit to us? I don't see any. Shutting down Iran's oil production pushes them into the arms of the Chinese and Russians.

6464 2018-10-24 12:54:46 Sure,
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups, or line the cups with paper muffin liners.
Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and pumpkin pie spice; set aside. Combine the brown sugar, white sugar, oil, applesauce, pumpkin,

6471 2018-10-24 12:54:27 Peanut allergies are part of whatever has gone wrong with human health. Maybe formula with vegetable oil fat base? Something is setting off the immune system of the infant/child. And I wonder what is unique to peanuts. I know they get toxic mold.
6472 2018-10-24 12:54:25 Sir with honour...is it will be wise to export food to Venezuela and Import crude oil
6473 2018-10-24 12:54:18 I'd love to see videos of kids seeing their dads getting back from an oil rig stint or a year stretch in prison, or even kids seeing their mom after a double-shift.
6474 2018-10-24 12:54:12 If the price of oil got too high, or the Saudis started to sell it for anything but dollars, the US would invade Saudi. Does anyone doubt that?

6482 2018-10-24 12:53:25 The difference is that some of AB's carbon-tax revenues are spent on emissions-reduction in the oil sands and the like. Saskatchewan could have managed its own carbon-tax revenue in the same way but wasn't prepared to develop a credible plan. So, it's being parented by Ottawa.
6483 2018-10-24 12:53:10 I visited a friend. ZESA  and water supplies which had been gone for days returned. There were wild cheers in the suburb.

6508 2018-10-24 12:50:14 can't possibly fathom the idea that there is an oil spill in the gulf that has been going on since 2004 & could be the worst in history. no one was aware. this planet belongs to all of us, whatever you are, it is long past time we start to care about the environment.

6510 2018-10-24 12:50:09 If you were to base it on SNP oil predictions, then probably! I'm not doing Scotland down, in case you hadn't noticed. Scotland deserves not to be told appalling lies. It deserves to be governed effectively. That isn't the same as stirring up grievance in Westminster govt.

The question remains, what will this money cost us? Silence on #Yemen?, #Khashoggi?, and #RadicalisationofPakistan?

6545 2018-10-24 12:47:04 We use Saudi Arabia as a proxy to fight Iranian interests. Not that I agree with the barbarism that they have carried out in Yemen. For practical sake, we need their oil. Paticulary since we have said we are shutting off Iranian oil in November. I do not agree with that policy.

6550 2018-10-24 12:46:42 Totally! And when you're captured in the circle of Opiates it's hard to let go. I swapped a Fentanyl patch for CBD oil. Never even had withdrawal. Granyed, I am also on Hydromorphone, but have been on breakthrough meds for years. CBD oil got me off the super hard shit.

6566 2018-10-24 12:45:05 I think those are ok, you have to rub  extra oil on them, still better than frying.

6570 2018-10-24 12:43:57 Inflation has done more to hurt people's spending power than taxes have. False inflation caused by cheap credit, and overvaluation of goods to increase corporate profit - especially by financial institutions and oil companies.

6578 2018-10-24 12:43:37 My tweet was intended to demonstrate the US will do anything to defend Isreal, including supporting an oil rich country which commits genocide in Yemen because Saudi Arabia sides with Isreal against Iran. Sorry the lack of explanation in my first reply.
6579 2018-10-24 12:43:36 “Our group is in the process of closing a $2.5 billion oil asset acquisition in the country. We are doing this as a demonstration of confidence in the economy. If the economy was not good or improving, we would not be contemplating that.”

6593 2018-10-24 12:41:45 Advocates of hydrogen fuel cells naturally lie. As everyone else does.
Hydrogen is now made from oil. Current fuel facilities can distribute hydrogen. Current internal combustion engines can burn hydrogen. Car and oil corp's ally against pure battery electric, breathing, health.

Just say you're coming to lay more oil pipelines.

You all choose to be deaf mute to all the killings, tribalism and others.
6598 2018-10-24 12:41:08 I guess, according to your arguments against off shore drilling, we should ban transport of oil and gas by truck and train? The benefits outweigh the risk. In my opinion, you should do more research on oil spill risk and the climate change argument, not just liberal views.

6601 2018-10-24 12:41:05 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
6602 2018-10-24 12:41:02 Two days off work, first damaged delivery, then no communication between customer services and delivery guys...now oil stains on my brand new carpet from delivery!!! Absolutely disgusted @OFLoakfurniture
6603 2018-10-24 12:40:52 At the risk of sounding naive and clueless.. is olive oil ok? Should is stick to coconut oil instead? Thank you! 
6604 2018-10-24 12:40:34 I wondered what the guy from Midnight Oil had been up to.
6605 2018-10-24 12:40:32 This oil change better not take forever

6611 2018-10-24 12:39:55 Can you ask him where is favourite Mediterranean country to live in is?

Does he like feta cheese?

And the question everyone wants to know: bread and honey or bread and olive oil?

6614 2018-10-24 12:39:45 I was going to show you a picture of my lunch but I ate it.
However, I can tell you that it was chopped avocado & baby plum tomatoes in an olive oil/balsamic vinegar/wholegrain mustard dressing (homemade). 
I then had cake but we won’t mention that

6617 2018-10-24 12:39:00 Scotland, the only country in the world to have discovered shite oil. Such a burden, I hope we don’t discover any more FFS. 
6618 2018-10-24 12:38:59 My mum had the audacity to ask for olive oil at a pub ahahahahaha
6619 2018-10-24 12:38:51 I had to put almost $400 on one this weekend. Had to get tires, an oil change and renew tags for my car. Smh
6620 2018-10-24 12:38:49 I doubt if any action could be taken against Saudi Arabia considering the davos in d desert currently underway and threat on oil prices. If it were a 3rd world country this incidence occurred we could have seen the west showing their muscle. It's such a same. IR has no morals

6624 2018-10-24 12:38:36 Watch out for the rain-slick roads.  They can cause whatever oil/grease are on them to be extra treacherous.

6632 2018-10-24 12:37:43 $DANSKE - Now price almost cut in half this year - We have to remember this is contained [not making any salad oil analogy here, btw].  Still sinking. ECB fines and US fines is the risk, + damage to client relationships + reputational risk. SIFI. No US banking license, btw.
6633 2018-10-24 12:37:40 Terrible. With no added friction to dissuade ppl to invest in new oil systems, potentially so much waste of household capital once oil prices increase - either through inevitable inflation or a future policy change with a tax on heating fuel, and homes must switch back.

6636 2018-10-24 12:36:56 I don't disagree at all - they're pretty far from OAK & HOU, so it makes little sense to burn the midnight oil for 2019
6637 2018-10-24 12:36:55 I don't really get the point the man was trying to make assuming he was asked to discuss Niger Delta and oil companies. There is nothing he said that relates to the question asked. What a pity!! NEVER AGAIN.
6638 2018-10-24 12:36:44 Putin declared the end of the U.S. as a world superpower ... Since when has the West or the Far East listened to a Russian?  From Kruschev to Brezhnev to Yeltsin the only one w/ credibility was Gorbachev b/c he sang our tune.  Oil has lost a $5 buck pizza a barrel since.

6650 2018-10-24 12:35:10 Economy is better, mainly cuz when u kick regulations, oil conservation, environment, & wildlife to the curb, its quicker to get stuff done, good or bad.

6655 2018-10-24 12:34:35 The ostensible target of Saudi attacks, the Houthis, are Iran-allied. Iran and Saudi Arabia disagree over oil and gas policy. The US wants copious oil and gas at low prices and sides with the kingdom. As long as any American uses fuel oil, we’re complicit in the attacks.

6666 2018-10-24 12:33:45 I laugh when people say “there’s so much money in Nigeria, better stay”

6674 2018-10-24 12:32:36 Hi Darrel, as well as tracking the crude oil price our prices are locally competitive, we aim to pass on reductions as quickly as we can but I have no timescale on how long this will take as price changes are area specific. Thanks - Lee
6675 2018-10-24 12:32:23 Tryna give Bronson this CBD oil and he’s not with it
6676 2018-10-24 12:32:06 Yep, and we're buying oil from a country who blatantly murders those who dare to question the rulers. We write off 2.6 B to Chrysler, no big deal. Goes on and on.

6683 2018-10-24 12:31:12 Reason for globalization was access to cheap labor (less safe, more desperate labor). Automation will take care of that. Countries that were on the needle of labor export will find themselves in the same situation Venezuela found itself with drop of oil prices. It will get worse
6684 2018-10-24 12:31:11 My mom just gave me oil to eat and let me tell you my stomach instantly started raging

6696 2018-10-24 12:30:05 Dear fellow YES campaigners.
 The IPCC say we have twelve years to prevent climate breakdown and, effectively, save the planet.
So for fuck's sake, shut up about the oil. We don't need it, and we shouldn't touch it.

By then, newer, more efficient cars should need less oil too – around 17 million barrels a day less, according to UBS.

6729 2018-10-24 12:26:52 Yes but seperate to Volker and seperate to oil prices the other big story of the 70s, as Minsky and MMT accept, was government trying to ensure full employment via the private sector. Hence the idea of a Jobs Guarantee rather than public spending creating private employment.

6737 2018-10-24 12:26:12 The post released by @StuartLWallace just proves the point about the UNSTAINABILITY of this OIL INDUSTRY. 

We cannot rely on NOCs for the OIL ECONOMICS because they are not driven by Profit and Losses but by cash vs something else (In the case of KSA can be anything with US)
6738 2018-10-24 12:26:09 Wow, such a title and the list of persons praising is incredible!
Congrats! Hope lots of other translations will be made!

6739 2018-10-24 12:26:09 I think it has also to do with mid term elections in US.Oil will again rise after the elections.This  is some US-SA relationship!!

6741 2018-10-24 12:25:56 People might have wanted to focus, concentrate on hearing the Saudi Arabia's prince's speech about the problem without something another confused issue from Qatar, another oil country which might not have had good relationship with Saudi Arabia usually generally.

6750 2018-10-24 12:24:27 That's correct, oil is not needed. It's time to switch to alternatives, like renewable resources. Why not start looking towards the DRC for a sustainable future? Why do you think the US hasn't invested in it yet?

6753 2018-10-24 12:24:20 While your plan is a start, you are continuing to kick the can down the road. You continually deflect from the SR15 report.  You bought a fossil fuel pipeline. You are allowing oil sands emissions to *increase* to 100Mt/year.

Also MMT acknowledges and agrees with the criticism of agg gov spending to create full private employment, which was the 1970s policy.

6801 2018-10-24 12:18:30 Advocates of hydrogen fuel cells naturally lie. As everyone else does.
Hydrogen, like fuels from oil, removes oxygen from air we breathe. Causing hypoxia.
This BURN produces electricity that powers motors that move car. Energy is lost at all 4 stages of hydrogen fuel cell work.

6865 2018-10-24 12:11:26 Yup, Talbot has bailed them out plenty of times already, wasn't his night last night and that happens. I'll take the point. If they can go 2-2 in their final four this month I think it is a monumental victory. 5-5-1 would be great with this schedule.

6872 2018-10-24 12:10:37 @realDonaldTrump You're very quiet about the Saudi / Kashoggi assassination. Does it have anything to do with Saudi spending $Billions on weaponry or are you worried about the price of Oil? If it were the Chinese, you'd be spitting feathers!!!

6875 2018-10-24 12:10:16 The oil field where Danjuma makes his money belongs to Nigeria. OBJ Farms is Operation Feed the Nation, it is ours. Intel Money that Atikulooted refuse to remit belongs to Nigeria. Only Buhari Ranch belongs to Buhari.

6881 2018-10-24 12:08:41 No. While most plastics are made with oil, fossil fuels actually come from ancient plants, not animals.
6882 2018-10-24 12:08:26 Imported inflation . Lower oil due to a recession (I don't see Saudis/Russia increasing barrels). 

 It's all about deflation/inflation dichotomy. But equities go down anyway under both scenarios. The second brings bonds down too.

The question on my mind. Is QT inflationary?

6909 2018-10-24 12:05:46 That's for oil, not shale gas it's a slightly different procedure and only requires 1 well unlike shale, and not on top of old mine workings in areas that have already suffered from subsidence, so yes we are an experiment, why are you trying to endanger my family?
6910 2018-10-24 12:05:33 As true for natural gas as for oil. Producer behavior is single most important factor. Behavior is complicated but price is at its root. Market raises price b/c of supply concern. Producers drill and produce more generally over-shooting demand so price falls.
6911 2018-10-24 12:05:28 lemme maximize my time today and go get my oil change and inspection done instead of waiting until tomorrow
6912 2018-10-24 12:05:13 Me olive oil. Ok
6913 2018-10-24 12:05:01 Isn't it's the same news publication which had came up with a report that coconut oil is poisonous/ toxic?!
6914 2018-10-24 12:04:59 It has real lemon oil in it, apparently.
6915 2018-10-24 12:04:46 First thought is more like the ecigs.  Nasty, socially disruptive, and a huge waste of money but at least they help loosen the stranglehold of the oil and gas industry.
6916 2018-10-24 12:04:46 That is outstanding. Alot of oil ..great news.
6917 2018-10-24 12:04:43 Why do we continue to do business w a country that was home to the 911 attackers?They are murderers and we no longer need their oil and their cultures. Is archaic.

7005 2018-10-24 11:55:58 99% do but as one dude said in the thread changing your oil every 3000 miles isnt all necessary but aint harmful if u do. They recommend it because ppl can remember that easier.
7006 2018-10-24 11:55:39 So ‘America’ didn’t want to tackle global warming or energy change. No, the “oil guys” wouldn’t want that would they !!!!! 
7007 2018-10-24 11:55:37 @CanadianPM Hello, if My project (oil from environmental wast) is to big for my local government in Manitoba, and they sent me to the NRC, but the NRC they are not working on any thing to do with reclaiming fuels from wast. Who do i talk to next? Please advise TY

7010 2018-10-24 11:55:19 You're right. It's a question of ethics. Building on green belt is an easy way to make a profit but has an increasingly negative effect on all of us and our environment. It's like allowing 25% more oil slicks to support jobs and profits in the oil industry

7015 2018-10-24 11:54:40 An oil change?? GTFOH
7016 2018-10-24 11:54:36 I don’t need to be powerball or mega millions rich. I just wanna be “change my oil when I’m suppose to” rich
7017 2018-10-24 11:54:24 And for the record as told by Tony Benn in his diaries, so did Labour before her. Choosing tax cuts over an oil fund. Tax cuts which Thatcher got to implement and then some.

7036 2018-10-24 11:52:11 When Nigerian economy was diversified pre oil era, over population was never an issue but as Nigeria focused on oil, the Indians were busy building their economy, taking over key markets like IT, telecoms, Pharmaceuticals, among others.
7037 2018-10-24 11:52:04 The best was when he took a fictional book "The Negotiator" and started broadcasting to his audience that he was onto some sort of world conspiracy on Peak Oil...quoting stuff from that book!

7043 2018-10-24 11:51:49 China is buying Venezuela to keep it socialist/communist. Bet the Clinton's are pissed they couldn't weasel in on the oil resources.

7048 2018-10-24 11:51:18 I heard almond oil is also good for your hair
7049 2018-10-24 11:51:14 Let's stick to the facts. How well did socialism work out for Venezuela?

Bear in mind, this country has larger oil reserves than Saudi Arabia.

How did socialism transform the country?

It went from wealthy to poor. From potential to misery.

Socialism is a failed principle
7050 2018-10-24 11:51:07 The OilyGarchy made oil a "necessity of life" by denying our access to Greener energy solutions.  Time for Green solutions.  Which Ford is now denying .......

7054 2018-10-24 11:50:27 Oil sector momentum has nothing to do with us.

It's not within our control.

The one which is within our control is the non-oil sector.

Unfortunately, that's exactly where this govt has failed, which is why I challenged Elumelu's stance.

7061 2018-10-24 11:49:56 The game, rather the stake is the position of Turkey vis-à-vis the Kurds in this region. So find alliances to achieve its ends, finish with the opposition and get your hands on a territory rich in oil!
7062 2018-10-24 11:49:55 The 42 tankers comprise of 23 actual tankers of oil, 10 steak bakes, 7 sausage and bean melts, 1 chicken bake, and a foot long SS sandwich. #ukog

I'm not playing the good cop hired by Big Oil, I'd like to help amend the toxic divide btw. the two camps where people even advocate for not listening to each other. I want to talk.

7067 2018-10-24 11:49:27 Im done with work at about 10am. I should clean my house and get an oil changed. But I’ll probably just end up taking a nap soon san I get home. I can feel it. Lol

7071 2018-10-24 11:49:00 Oil & Gas development isn't my strong suit so my apologies. Back in March they were out running test with what I call probes every 20/ac or so. How they got here sounds Disneyland. It'll be interesting over the next couple months.

7075 2018-10-24 11:48:38 can you test your labour socialist politics by answering these two questions.
1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil revenues or the 8% we get now?
2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country.?
My own 30 year labour support fell down with those

7077 2018-10-24 11:48:25 If that proof raises oil prices, cuts the profits of defense contractors, limits Saudi investments on real estate in the US and so on then its not worth it. Thats the reality.
7078 2018-10-24 11:48:16 Someone has to weed around graves of our fallen heroes there while we look for cooking oil elsewhere. Hahaha
7079 2018-10-24 11:48:14 Absolutely! No point buying something you're going to use once...I'm going to use Disaronno for the liquor and sesame oil for the hazelnut oil. Never have I had a recipe that uses hazelnut oil so would be a complete waste of money. My cake will just be more almondy!

7081 2018-10-24 11:47:50 Agreed but emphasis should be on growing other sectors while keeping momentum of the oil sector too. If the economy must grow, the oil and non oil sector especially are factors.

7134 2018-10-24 11:41:59 No, genuinely about carbon capture and storage, not just reducing emissions. You can hate on oil companies all you want but they have the scale, experience and capital to build stuff at a commercial level.

7142 2018-10-24 11:40:50 Have not heard much from Smythe since his "expert" claim that the oil that "was absolutely immovable" has been flowing by the mega tanker load. 

Is it 42 tankers now at well over 200 barrels of oil per tanker?
7143 2018-10-24 11:40:45 Does it include delaying and even failing to implement Russian sanctions?   Does it include nixxing the #IranDeal, driving up the price of Russian oil?   
Does it include weakening and even threatening to abandon NATO, in furtherance of Putins ambitions?

7153 2018-10-24 11:39:20 It's "spilling" from the earth though isn't it?  If it's plugged it doesn't make that crude oil disappear it just stays in the earth.  Seems the better thing to do would be extract the oil and find some kind of use for it.....not sure what that could be.
7154 2018-10-24 11:39:13 Ha ha ha what deflection. See I don't goose where, say, Texaco source their oil from. You choose to go on Twitter and support a nation that is a massive state sponsor of terrorism and sends fundamentalist imams across the world.
7155 2018-10-24 11:39:07 Form the C8 BCE to early C2 CE, Rome expanded based on the plunder (slaves and wealth) of newly conquered land. They were mining the accumulated annual solar surpluses of each new conquest.

Much as we've used coal and then oil over since 1750.

We work with the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), who promote practices that help reduce deforestation, and preserve habitats and biodiversity.
7157 2018-10-24 11:39:01 Olive oil isnt even olive :P
7158 2018-10-24 11:38:44 Taking oil price down by $10 bucks a barrel will ensure that demand stays strong & that their will be no supply response. In other word like everything else government does this is shortsighted & will cause long term problems. So as an oil bull I am disappointed not discouraged.
7159 2018-10-24 11:38:40 Not while they can still pump oil
7160 2018-10-24 11:38:36 There was a great bbc documentary on oil few years ago. 'planet oil' well worth a watch also. Being in to prospective of the importance of the fossil fuel to today's society.
7161 2018-10-24 11:38:36 It's a shame how politics can intrude so heavily on basic economics. KSA and Kuwait could have had very cheap pipeline gas from Qatar, instead of still relying on crude oil or HFO after all these years.

How much oil money was paid to Corbyn to fund his activities? 

Don’t you think we deserve the truth instead of your slanted propaganda & falsehoods
7180 2018-10-24 11:36:10 Not exactly.

The oil sector can do well without the rest of the economy following suit.

Oil has been selling for over $60 this year yet the economy has taken a downturn rather than improving.

What does that tell you?

7232 2018-10-24 11:30:24 It's nice that, four years after she'd predicted with confidence that oil revenues would be between £6.8bn-£7.9bn, they're up to 16-20% of that. Do you ever fear that the SNP might think you're a mug?

7270 2018-10-24 11:24:42 Zinc oxide tape (can buy at clicks ) or even a cream with zinc. I remember that working on the burns patients. Otherwise daily massage with any tissue oil will lighten it.
7271 2018-10-24 11:24:40 Try bentonite clay or activated charcoal masks, not daily though.  They help shrink pores so your skin won't produce as much oil. Partner that with oil free/water-based moisturizers esp the ones with SPF. Do that for like a month and you'll see an improvement.
7272 2018-10-24 11:24:40 Saudi Arabia  soon after nuke tests gave for 8 years a facility for 50,000 barrel oil a day. They gave a billion $ in 2014 which #khan called a compromise of sovereignty than. They had through 2008 to 2015 a revolving facility ! I work here I know ! No one has advertised it !
7273 2018-10-24 11:24:35 Dude, we’ve been arming ugly dictators to fight other more ugly dictators for centuries. You do realize we buy a shit ton of oil from Saudi Arabia? We arm them to protect our oil interests in their country. That has nothing do with how Clinton would handle Khashoggi.

7283 2018-10-24 11:23:40 @BankofNamibia left the repo rate unchanged today. This was largely expected. Inflation, while on the rise, still remains well within target. The recent easing in the oil price and strengthening of the Rand should see inflation remain within acceptable levels over the short term.

7569 2018-10-24 10:48:02 Meanwhile they stop subsidies on solar panels and onshore wind, and reject tidal schemes.
Are the Tories in the pockets of the big oil & energy companies? 
Just as the Republicans are in USA???

7571 2018-10-24 10:47:43 @CyrilRamaphosa Sir, do a deal with Saudi Arabia, sell minority shares in Denel in exchange for unlimited oil at $40 per barrel.This will allow you to drop fuel price to about R10 per liter, if we can reduce levies, fuel cud be under R9 per liter, great!!

7581 2018-10-24 10:46:24 Oil refineries are very important for Pakistan. It means cheaper diesel,petrol and aviation fuel, local plastic production industry and cheaper raw materials to make roads and highways, making construction ofnthem much cheaper, as well as saving lots of foreign exchange.

7586 2018-10-24 10:45:52 What are we doing
We are holding the line

Now petrol should start to drop soon oil did
Sometimes that's how it is
7587 2018-10-24 10:45:46 Deal with how ur favourite president in the world....Trump....handled it....
Nelly choose oil, arms deal....over human being
7588 2018-10-24 10:45:44 Yes, it is a responsible response considering the clown you support,i.e. Trudeau killed Energy East. If we had that pipeline Canada would import exactly ZERO Saudi oil. But you jumped on the oil bashing bandwagon in the misguided belief it would stop climate change- delusional

7591 2018-10-24 10:45:02 You’re right Rob and slowly (very slowly) it is being addressed - even if it takes the Worlds oil reserves to run out to stop it. But this is a quick fix to stop adding to air pollution - Why does being a smoker seem to give you additional ‘rights’ to pollute ?

7593 2018-10-24 10:44:58 Like a classic western where the bad guys want the gold or the oil or the magic toupee cream and they need to move the townspeople to get it and so they stick the voting booth out in a remote canyon full of snipers ... we know who the bad guys are here right?

7596 2018-10-24 10:44:32 If Shell & other oil companies wants to remain after Biafra independent their should agree on our terms & conditions which will still be of a huge benefits for them because they are good in it !
7597 2018-10-24 10:44:30 In 2007-8, more than 8 companies were interested in establishing oil refineries, with 5 of them overseas Pakistani owned from the US, Middle East and Far East. Zardari asked for 10 million dollars from each and they all refused and invested in other countries.

See how well they fare
7601 2018-10-24 10:43:49 This was not in anyway related to the 0% tax policy of WM govt to extract maximum oil.
7602 2018-10-24 10:43:46 LoL, she wanted to go after oil cabal and they unleashed their machineries on her online .

7604 2018-10-24 10:43:26 @tedcruz Your latest rally show why you are not fit to lead this state any longer! You are pathetic leading that chant. Not only that, but on Monday you were meeting with oil executives while Beto was meeting with the people. One more reason to vote for Beto. He gets it!
7605 2018-10-24 10:43:17 Transitioned from the oil money fc banter era to the emptihad banter era smoothly.
7606 2018-10-24 10:43:15 Murdering a journalist, making the journalists son a captive forcing him into an ISIS like photo OP, 19 of the 22 terrorists of 911 were Saudis. So why are they our allies? They suckered the Bush admin with oil $ and suckering the Trump admin with hotel & oil $. 
Our Enemy!!!
7607 2018-10-24 10:43:10 Just curious... is the end goal of the energytransistion not to phase out  oil and gas in the coming decades?

We shud spend our energies2 develop da technology. So we can take out gold,copper ourselves.

Less than 48 hours until we host our #SustainablePalmOil city networking event at @ChezJules! 

Join us at 8am to find out more about palm oil from our experts, ask any questions you might have and meet other companies trying to make a difference 
7611 2018-10-24 10:42:12 no not at all you can have all the oil in the world 
its still in the ground 2 years at least before production licence  gets passed
scc will drag permits
7612 2018-10-24 10:42:07 We should be mindful with the oil business which is globally declining & focus on human resources

7623 2018-10-24 10:41:06 Creation of jobs without fixing electricity? With the amount of revenue with the oil boom, how many jobs were created? We are still talking about fixing infrastructures and roads till today. The present govt is supposed to be talking about other serious things, not roads,
7624 2018-10-24 10:40:53 Westminster cant beat snp fairly at the ballot box so they are going to try any thing to keep our resources.
They went to war for oil,they wont let scots walk away with thiers just cos they voted to.
7625 2018-10-24 10:40:52 Every time they take oil down like this it increases the bull case. The cure for high prices is high prices but the goons at Fed/Treasury are not smart enough to let this happen. So you keep the price down encouraging consumption & discouraging investment/risk taking.

7631 2018-10-24 10:39:26 Bear in mind those who say that are the same people who take 92% of scots oil revenues then tell us we are too skint for indy !
7632 2018-10-24 10:39:23 Article could have done with some insights into the possible role that could be envisaged for the private players here in oil and gas sector considering this sector is consumer sensitive as it has direct impact on the price of essential commodities due to transportation cost.
7633 2018-10-24 10:39:22 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
7634 2018-10-24 10:39:09 Agree but she goes from zero to 100 and doesn’t let the say one sentence. That’s why her and Chandler are oil and water, also because he’s an asshole
7635 2018-10-24 10:39:08 Waste of time only if you don't mind giving your entire persona (PII, demo, fp, iris) for state surveillance or be traded between pvt parties without legal warrants. Being a journo covering oil, econ politics, you have all the more reason not to give in.

7644 2018-10-24 10:36:33 America who have become the biggest oil supplier in the world via fracking have lesser of those resources compared to South Africa, yet we have done case studies etc and did nothing else. Northern cape can produce enough oil via fracking to sustain South Africa for 100 years

7652 2018-10-24 10:35:36 This same lies was fabricated when Jonathan was in power in order to bring in Buhari. He will still assign the oil blocks to his cronies. Buhari has failed the nation. He's amongst the military juntas that brought Nigeria this low. Tell yourself the truth.

7657 2018-10-24 10:35:04 2. The @NNPCgroup added that if we sell CIF we would have to wait for a minimum of 40 days to receive payment which may hamper Nigeria's financial plans- however, if we sell FOB, we could get paid immediately the buyer takes his product from the oil terminal.
7658 2018-10-24 10:35:00 Saudi's do not have the spare capacity only the perception which is all that is needed in our HFT HFT (high frequency trading, high frequency talking) world. We are in a painful transition away from USD centric world but it's coming. Take down on oil feels intentional we'll see.

7743 2018-10-24 10:23:33 It's not that I disagree that we need to leave the bulk of the world's fossil fuels in the ground, but shouldn't we concentrate on reducing demand rather than supply?  If we focus on the latter, it'll just drive up prices, making it even more lucrative to extract oil elsewhere.
7744 2018-10-24 10:23:20 I wouldn't say only, but a major part govt issue yes. No accountability also . Relied heavily on oil, and when world powers reduced it, messed up the systems in placed.

7824 2018-10-24 10:12:49 I can't wait for our oil in this country to finish or for our buyers and the world to move on from oil and start depending on something better - something we can't produce. Nigerian leaders are wicked. I can't wait for this to happen so that they can suffer like we are doing too.

7830 2018-10-24 10:12:11 And those properties where gas cannot be supplied? Or where the electricity supply is vulnerable to bad weather. So they're burning heating oil, or wood/coal on open fires? And how about the vulnerability of (fossil fuel) gas supply, as much comes from Russia? Or should we Frack?
7831 2018-10-24 10:12:10 Surely that’s a huge reason to divest away from Aberdeen’s single industry dynamic that’s dominated here for half a century? Literally create jobs in other industries that oil worker can move into?

7869 2018-10-24 10:08:31 For North Sea Oil, Treasury has a 0% tax rate on many of the older wells, this is because they want as much oil extracted as possible and it wouldn’t be viable otherwise due to cost of decommissioning, rather than just capping these wells and moving on

They can get visas because they are our rich oil buddies. Bush used to cow tow to Saudis. Republicans will take monies from anyone and let them run rampant. But poor countries can't.
7878 2018-10-24 10:07:18 And why not also use the Saudi oil wealth to rebuild Syria, Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan instead of propping up the US empire? A trillion dollars would go some way towards that goal.

7882 2018-10-24 10:06:35 The oil price has gone form c$44 at the time of the referendum to nearly $80 before falling back in recent days. That was nothing to do with Brexit but has a big impact on inflation and growth.

7903 2018-10-24 10:04:54 The oil price needs also a lower dollar as catalyst for more oil demand. As long as US production and the USD are high, there will be no spike in oil.
7904 2018-10-24 10:04:54 Well, I think I will have to go with shockingly bad journalism. That's not a comparison to petrol/diesel cars, it's an "I love oil so I'm going to make EVs look as rubbish as possible"

8110 2018-10-24 09:35:37 The quality of oil is different from Nigeria to Middle East. Our refineries are built for the Middle East quality

8114 2018-10-24 09:35:10 My bf gets these every now and then. His mouth gets covered in them. Is clove oil any good? He's never tried it.
8115 2018-10-24 09:35:08 A'ah. Maybe ada mineral oil. Better check ingredients balik.
8116 2018-10-24 09:34:55 The price is still the same. Remember opec kinda determines the prices and nearly all oil producing countries are part of opec.
8117 2018-10-24 09:34:45 Ouhhh okayy okayy. Ada lagi ke dah sold out oil yg awak nak letgo tu?

8120 2018-10-24 09:34:38 Nigeria’s growth rate likely only seems high on account of how much oil prices were affecting the country during the previous quarters. As they say: when you’ve hit the bottom, there’s nowhere to go but up

8133 2018-10-24 09:32:56 #TipOfTheDay Coconut oil is a natural moisturizer that can help heal chapped lips caused by cold or dry weather. Simply apply pure coconut oil several times a day on your lips to keep them moist. You can also use olive oill.
8134 2018-10-24 09:32:49 You already raped Kuwait Iraq Libya Nigeria destroyed Argentina economy with hopes of cheap looted blood oil. Consider that. The alternative is not fracking it's electric bikes. But since no one protests about blood oil we can expect more war crimes and false flag invasions.

8160 2018-10-24 09:30:00 Twisted logic covering the real reason why. Fear of who the other might be, money, oil, influence or lack of it or sheer stupidity aka incompetence. My father used to say, any excuse was a good excuse.

8162 2018-10-24 09:29:53 Govt has been told as much by its climate change secretariat. A reduction in the rate you pay on the 1st block of your electric bill has brought them closer but oil still has the advantage. A carbon tax would flip that around.
8163 2018-10-24 09:29:43 Can’t believe that Jojoba oil gave me welts.
8164 2018-10-24 09:29:43 As half that debt is actually attributed UK debt and as we need the real whisky and oil figures to be released as they do not make sense compared to Irish whisky returns and Norwegians oil returns a discussion on debt and deficit with real figures will be welcome.
8165 2018-10-24 09:29:42 Interested to discover that in Italy (in most parts), they don't add cream to carbonara. Just olive oil, egg and parmigiano. Whereas in the US, they tend to throw in cream, butter, the works. Er, that's it.

8168 2018-10-24 09:29:28 Really strange headline though - the article mentions possible future production and exploration expenditure of GBP 330 bn then the headline equates this to what the remaining oil extracted could be worth ignoring market value. 17 bln barrels at USD 70/bbl is USD 1,190 bn.
8169 2018-10-24 09:29:25 Arrogance & stupidity not a great mix. The blow torch will be put on them because of this. But they own most of of the worlds oil, so nobody will go too hard on them

8173 2018-10-24 09:28:35 it s butchering , a massacre of the economy. China trade war is killing the economy.  and the hate Trump has for crude oil is also killing the economy
8174 2018-10-24 09:28:30 It Was Washington in his plan to steal arab's oil and take Turkey, incriminating Saudis.
8175 2018-10-24 09:28:16 PEI has been taxing oil at a lower rate than electricity (until this year, much lower: 5 vs 15%). This has been like the opposite of a carbon tax, encouraging residents to use the heating source that causes the most pollution.
8176 2018-10-24 09:28:10 They are fighting for us? Or for the oil.
8177 2018-10-24 09:28:08 Angolan, Nigerian, Guinea petrochemical & gas engineers (or Mr. President )can't fund building oil refineries in Somalia, Uganda or Kenya under bilateral funding agreement.

8198 2018-10-24 09:25:22 Jamal Khashoggi's son shaking the hand of MBS is the sign of class. How MBS could even offer him his 'condolences' when he gave the order to kill him is beyond me. Why @theresa_may isn't sanctioning the Saudi regime is also beyond me. Does oil matter more? #JusticeForJamal
8199 2018-10-24 09:25:19 Saudi ISIS country was founded when oil was discovered, but same people, the arabs including the Al Saud tribe were roaming in the deserts there for a long time. It's true Arabs used to bury their baby girls alive at birth, in the sand.
8200 2018-10-24 09:25:12 Great for the city...? 
So #VWTCross is an #EV? 
That's good, get rid of the poisonous oil burners that kills people.
8201 2018-10-24 09:25:01 But right now, we don't. I know your example is hypothetical, but if the gov't is really going to tax more for oil, they really have to start using renewables. Or charge the same for electric and oil.
8202 2018-10-24 09:24:43 In reality you can probably times that sum by ten and that's not taking into account the oil in the Atlantic Margin

8231 2018-10-24 09:21:24 Canadian light oil has been tanking recently as well. The $64K question, is $CPG continuing to hedge at these terrible prices going forward?

8240 2018-10-24 09:19:51 Trump's decision to let Congress decide means no real action against KSA until after elections, by which time Iran Sanctions will be in effect with KSA aid on oil supplies.
Expect US to be thankful to KSA and ready to levy more sanctions against Turks for just about any excuse
8241 2018-10-24 09:19:50 Saudi's control over the Oil Market is go great.
I think they are the biggest players in the Crude Futures market also
By getting crude down, showing intent and maybe get diversion from the #khasshogi issue.
8242 2018-10-24 09:19:43 In terms of oil prices, tis a double edged sword 4 Nigeria cos while we export at 80 naira, we import at 100 naira. Then is the underecovery price of 53naira per litre of PMS. Thus the urgent need foe economic diversification.Ben Akabueze @nesv @OCPPolicyCenter #MoroccoNigeria
8243 2018-10-24 09:19:41 well 12% left its doable but my oil is not
8244 2018-10-24 09:19:39 Because oil causes more carbon pollution. The idea is to tax the things that cause the most pollution. If we used exclusively wind & other renewables for elec (we don't), under a true carbon tax electricity would not be taxed. Thus, homeowners encouraged to use it.

8251 2018-10-24 09:18:37 MEGATRON: That makes TORQ captain of that oil tanker! Rumble, fire circuit linker cards at the entire fleet!
8252 2018-10-24 09:18:35 Yes, fracking revolution in US & other developments make Saudi role in international oil markets less important, tho not UNimportant. My observations on the arms trade were meant ironically or maybe even sarcastically, but politicians here take it seriously.
8253 2018-10-24 09:18:15 The market will never decide for us to use green cheaper energy. We have the technology to use energy from the sun, but would rather fight for oil and dig for coal. Both of the latter are bad for the environment and cause death and refugees.

8311 2018-10-24 09:08:57 Carbon tax in Canada is bullshit! No tax will reduce carbon emissions. Oil corporations must become more responsible.

8379 2018-10-24 09:00:14 The thing is, some warrant holders will sell the shares they bought in the placing and keep hold of the warrants as its of no risk to them. They will only have to pay for them once they're profitable to them. In regards to JAN its 6p.
8380 2018-10-24 09:00:10 Oil dey ur head broda
8381 2018-10-24 09:00:09 they up oil prices, making all products and travel cost much more.
8382 2018-10-24 09:00:01 There was no more oil in the house, nor were there any candles.（家にはもう油がなく、ろうそくもありませんでした。）
8383 2018-10-24 08:59:57 How do you know that he needs "saanday kaa tael" any experience of his weeknesses and effectiveness of that oil.
8384 2018-10-24 08:59:32 There is a massive disinformation campaign by big oil and coal companies. They have no interest in humanity moving away from their product. You have a choice when it comes to being manipulated by them.
8385 2018-10-24 08:59:26 @wizkidayo jst fucked the entire industry up In few hours...internet sef hands up for the matter.too much oil pon the boy head.#FEVER
8386 2018-10-24 08:59:25 If labour had not hidden the massive wealth of Scotland's oil from the Scots and lied to our pensioners about losing their pensions we would have voted for independence and had no problem paying every body equal wages and there is no such party as Scottish labour
8387 2018-10-24 08:59:17 Lot of work is being done to reduce the dependency on oil and gas. If you are not a pappu, you will know that those initiatives take time to give results. Btw, how many cars do you take in your convoy?
8388 2018-10-24 08:59:14 Since I was born, and Now I am getting Old, I am still wondering why Benin people call it OYEL instead of OIL.

8391 2018-10-24 08:59:08 #ukog Regards the oil or should I say Gas. Been wondering about that rocket flare we saw last week just before they moved on to KL4. Massive flow and associated Gas by the looks of it. I am expecting in excess of  1000b/d with no loss of pressure when the RNS further KL3 data.
8392 2018-10-24 08:58:59 hehehe ati achieve what? Lets import wheat, maize, Sugar, omena, beans, cooking oil, rice. Are still exporting miraa?
8393 2018-10-24 08:58:53 Bcos Forbes is now EFCC or court that decides who got his money legally. Come to think of it, do u think that Dangote did nt get rich with ur common wealth? Saudi prince is in Forbes bt he got his money from oil etc. Many on Forbes do nt even have a business like @atiku. Know it
8394 2018-10-24 08:58:44 There are a few obscure oil ones too
8395 2018-10-24 08:58:35 Shut off the oil taps and see Americans spend 800$ a month on gas. Oil is less than 80$ a barrel. The Saudis are talking 400$
8396 2018-10-24 08:58:21 とりあえず感動して泣いとこう
8397 2018-10-24 08:58:13 Sorry, but that's a fact, I know you don't like them. I've no idea what you mean, no one says we don't have oil, it's just to expensive to extract. I'm glad Sturge-Un lied about the fracking ban, though. (It's a thing, she can't lie straight, in her bed)
We need go get cracking.

8407 2018-10-24 08:57:22 Oil prices in Australia have been at around $1.6 per litre for the last 4 to 6 months - and so is in most of the oil-importing countries.

Why dont you do some research beforehand?
8408 2018-10-24 08:57:18 Thank you @KeithKeithya for your explanation and I will watch Justin's video too...
8409 2018-10-24 08:57:03 The idea being the warrant acts as a reward for the investor supporting the Co by buying shares in the placing. Because it involves paying over more cash to Co warrant holders normally wait until hopefuly the SP has risen above the fixed warrant exercise price to guarantee profit

8423 2018-10-24 08:54:18 Speaking of oil. Ted Cruz is paid for by big Oil, the NRA, Russian Dark Money, 3-D gun org, & the Mercer's.

He has said he wants to repeal & replace t/ ACA. But, NOW he's lying, saying he wants to continue insurance covering pre-existing conditions so he'll be re-elected. LIAR.

8425 2018-10-24 08:53:56 I have a theory on Ferrari, I think at the start of the season everything was turned up on the car, now later in the season with used parts & engine restrictions etc everything is slowing down

Not just that didn’t they get caught out with too much oil entering the engine?

8427 2018-10-24 08:53:51 My new book: OIL & GOD
Why has US been protecting Riyadh despite its dictatorship & Wahhabi cult?
-Control 1 dictator who owes his crown to US is easier than controlling many politicians in a democracy
-Fear that true religious & political reforms lead to loss of control over oil
8428 2018-10-24 08:53:30 Bob Dudley CEO of BP once answered when asked about trajectory of oil prices.."I am as clueless as you"..ONGC CMD after retirement needs some timepass so comes on rumour monger business channels to entertain people....

8431 2018-10-24 08:53:09 Heid it's the right to pay for a share at a fixed price at some point, normally with an expiry date. It involves creating new shares, hence dilutive but the Co gets the cash. Normally issued when new shares are created as in a placing, i.e. 1 warrant for 1 share bought
8432 2018-10-24 08:53:07 Lol, with his beef with Iran, where else can he get oil?

8441 2018-10-24 08:52:01 Someone said the discovery of oil in Nigeria is the beginning of our problem. We are feeding on agriculture before oil. Nigeria's mining and agricultural sector failed as the oil industry began to boom.
8442 2018-10-24 08:51:59 You just can't admit ,Saudi Arabia is the real terrorist threat can you? Too busy kissing their arses for oil, blinded you to facts has it? Who funded 9-11 terrorists? Where were the majority of the 9-11 terrorists from?

8453 2018-10-24 08:50:23 Root cause of all our inflation related problems especially fuel costs is the population explosion that’s no longer a projection but a reality 2day.. w/out controlling population,demand for consumables is always gonna far exceed supply especially for oil. No govt has a magic wand
8454 2018-10-24 08:49:49 Pakistan at present is producing 100,000 barrels of oil per day which is 50 percent of its requirement. I want to know how it is priced ? Are we charged international prices for that also , and locals get some relief if not then is it reflected in our BOP??
8455 2018-10-24 08:49:47 Mi-cellar water, gel based face wash, toner, skin repair cream, tinted moisturiser with SPF, face powder ( for special occasions), Oil lock face mist. Trust me its god sent and perfected over years. Also all Korean brands. Totally lifesaver. :)

8459 2018-10-24 08:49:13 At time SG announced 'effective ban' (i.e. policy ban) last October they couldn't have legislated because powers over onshore oil and gas licensing hadn't yet transferred from Westminster. Those powers now with Holyrood so once SEA process is complete we can indeed ban fracking.
8460 2018-10-24 08:49:06 In my country flowers are not the best gift right now but rather a 2litre bottle of cooking oil will be the ideal gift

8465 2018-10-24 08:48:41 I’ve tried apps that talk to you to help you sleep but I always find it hard to concentrate and my mind always ends up wandering and I stop listening and paying attention  thinking of trying CBD oil next

Stalin had a mighty moustache and eyebrows.
That's how you can tell him apart from the others.
8469 2018-10-24 08:48:11 Wow! This was the first thing on my mind immediately after Saudi announced they are now willing to fill any supply deficit as a result of US sanction on Iran. Oil back to the pre-defiance range.
8470 2018-10-24 08:48:07 Freshly ground masala, (with fresh turmeric if available,) boiled for  the right time( till the raw smell disappears) fish added & cooked just for a few minutes with a garnish of curry leaves, coconut oil & slit green chillies. Heaven.

8474 2018-10-24 08:47:36 That is a very good objective for a country with next to no auto industry, and very limited own oil & gas reserves. Georgia has over the last years focused on hydropower.

8481 2018-10-24 08:46:09 Maybe I don't kno. If the ministry allows the industry to directly compete with the SA for example in terms of pricing without being restricted to charge in local currency it may help. I think the reason why we don't have cooking oil in Zimbabwe is purely pricing distortions.

8498 2018-10-24 08:44:12 1973 Saudi Arabia decided to impose oil embargo on #West when Israel won war with Egypt and Syria. Snag was America fleet stationed in the region. So, Saudi allowed USA fleet to have oil. Read Major Barbara. You’d sell product with proviso it can’t be used? Saudi is key U.K. ally

8501 2018-10-24 08:43:49 So i agree with you. But the oil sustained them to a developed nation first before they thought of diversification. 1st was the innovation then 2nd was the invetion. Nigeria lacks either. Spent billions all in the name of building our power sector meanwhile they were building

Better yet, have you also discovered how to reduce our dependency on oil in a way where nobody has to pay for the investment in infrastructure? Enlighten me.

#KPCOilSpillageScandal
8506 2018-10-24 08:43:22 I have been relatively pain free for the last three weeks. Monday I drove for almost eight hours taking my dad to an appointment for a follow up after surgery the week before. Today the pain in my arm has returned with a vengeance. CBD oil isn't enough today.
8507 2018-10-24 08:43:02 No expected uptick in shale oil from the US that might impact prices?
8508 2018-10-24 08:42:54 They went to Dubai to discuss continuous displacement agenda for their neocolonialism in Nigeria they are in immigrants & in Biafra they are terrorist, killing to retain occupation mostly in Niger Delta, the oil rich Biafra. Who among them there aren't immigrants terrorist sons?
8509 2018-10-24 08:42:43 Quite. For too long western democracies have been sucking up to this undemocratic, brutal, monarchical government. It is pointless to say we need these 'friends' in the Middle East. They sponsored IS! When we no longer need their oil the friendship will sour.

Did a research on the futures brokers in the #US recently. #TDAmeritrade is a good one. I may open an account soon. 
The pros: fund security, minimum deposit, ACH transfer, low fees & options on futures
The cons: few platform selections & no low daytrading margin
8512 2018-10-24 08:42:38 They say castor oil tastes bad! Bet they haven't tried liquid potassium?... Gross
8513 2018-10-24 08:42:20 You are still making excuses for them, oga mi sir. Maybe we should ask nations like saudi arabia and qatar the question you just asked. 
UAE was built with crude. Tourism came into play from early 2000s cos they know the oil would soon finish. What do u have to say bout Nigeria
8514 2018-10-24 08:42:19 We need to diversify to achieve economic stability, create employment. Oil in UAE will run out by 2025, what will happen to Nigeria when will run out of oil? We have to devise plans to generate income from other avenues my brother.

8525 2018-10-24 08:41:10 Environmentally conscious consumers should demand palm oil from certified sources, but avoiding it altogether runs the risk of putting pressure on other crops that are equally to blame for the world’s environmental problems... 1/2
8526 2018-10-24 08:40:51 Your welcome lovely, you could even simply dilute a few drops of oil into a spray bottle with water and spray.....absolutely everywhere! In the home that works too  xx
8527 2018-10-24 08:40:28 Falih talked about going to a 70% gas 30% renewables/nuclear mix for Saudi electricity consumption. How realistic do you think this is (he said they are at a 50/50 Oil/gas right now)

8529 2018-10-24 08:40:03 The most common use of sulfuric acid (60% of total) is for fertilizer manufacture. It is also a central substance in the chemical industry. Principal uses include fertilizer manufacturing (and other mineral processing), oil refining, wastewater processing, and chemical synthesis.
8530 2018-10-24 08:39:56 Because oil is also currently on a downward trajectory it is possible. But we not sure yet what will happen when the sanctions kicks in next month against Iran if their will be a dime in oil prices,  it hey R2 a litre less is possible

I was wondering if you have any data on Hydraulic oil cost, building square meter cost in Germany in the 1995. Thanks a lot!!!
8532 2018-10-24 08:39:36 My new book: Oil and God
US’ control over Saudi oil exports is non-lethal WMD against big oil importing rivals China, EU, India, Japan...
Thus, oil protected SaudiA before & after 9/11.

8537 2018-10-24 08:39:10 I love how Umji is a monthly model in a japanese magazine that is relevant and popular. I remember one oil spill group was featured on a japanese magazine and that issue of them on the cover ended up being the last.
8538 2018-10-24 08:39:08 Weird justice in Saudis using more energy/money to keep cool than the value of their oil experts. Years ago there was a bumper sticker in Texas 'Let them freeze in the dark' telling everyone how they felt about Yankees wanting cheap oil.

Kindly direct the company to do so ASAP. Candidates should not be asked to wait for so long in this era of #digitalindia.

8555 2018-10-24 08:37:10 LOL we have been giving to oil industry so much subsidies over the time, it should be nationalised as we paid billions for it.  The price at the pump il always more.

Did you get a shower or a face spray?
8560 2018-10-24 08:36:50 I would agree if it were about going to the IMF, which is a big step. But the Saudi loan is hardly a loan worth interest. It is a one year straight deposit, and a one year deferment of oil payments, especially designed to help Pakistan for a year, no other notice.
8561 2018-10-24 08:36:44 So no olive oil in your cooking?
8562 2018-10-24 08:36:28 Give an amateur the best studio and team in the world they'll make nothing. Give an expert a stick and sand they'll make art.

8573 2018-10-24 08:35:37 Oga mi sir, nobody is making excuses for our leaders. Yes, proceedings from oil is enough to build world class Nigeria but do you think any country/individual can survive on one major source of income?
8574 2018-10-24 08:35:20 PM @ImranKhanPTI Saudi Arabia will deposit 3 billion dollars into SBP! Saudi Arabia has also agreed to provide a total of $9 billion worth of oil on deferred payments. The Saudi Arabian investment in CPEC is separate! @PTIofficial

8588 2018-10-24 08:33:44 We could start by closing mosques which have been founded by the Saudis and are known to be preaching hate. We should also cancel arms deals to them. Of course none of that will happen because we're too scared they'll remove money from city banks or spike the oil price.

8598 2018-10-24 08:32:39 Anyone who sold #AAOG this morning will be crying and looking to get back in. Nothing’s changed at all. Next week we should see oil at the first zone. Then it’s game on.

Well, oil is an antiquated resource that is really hard to let go of.  "We" pay to have more of it, even though it's depleting.  Supply and demand. You ensure a demand and force a supply.  #goldenidol

8644 2018-10-24 08:25:43 "Oil boom with indy" WAS a BIG lie. As was "We will be richer with indy" & "A Yes will see iScot REMAIN in EU". ALL 100% verifiable LIES. As was the "£7-9 BILLION oil revenue per year". LIES. "The White Paper was a fantasy document"-said the guy who wrote it
8645 2018-10-24 08:25:30 2/ Talks were going on behind the scene for weeks. Govt of Pakistan must have informed them about the measures they have taken till now & future economic reforms. The modalities of how the loan & deferred oil payment will work & its repayment. No harm in being honest & candid.
8646 2018-10-24 08:25:16 Only good on paper, in thought, until you need cooking oil, salt, running water, a safe place to keep your money, transport, and all basic essentials, which are all taxed 
8647 2018-10-24 08:25:15 I can see three motivations for the hard-core climate change deniers:
1) Enjoy the benefits of fossil fuels while we can - some generation has to be the last, so why not us?
2) (related to 1) Get richer by investing in coal and oil.
3) Screw around just for fun with 'scientists'.

8751 2018-10-24 08:09:09 I am not sure of that as WTI was 72 just one week ago and it takes weeks between buying the oil and it arriving. But in any case this Saudi pledge to pump to the maximum is something that will not be forgotten in one day. Anything around 68 will be good resistance now.

8757 2018-10-24 08:08:07 I think one of the reasons why Trump is hesitant on talking about Saudi sanctions is because Iran sanctions are about to kick in Nov. 4th and sanctioning Saudi at the same time could result in a serious jump in oil prices and lack of supply.

8781 2018-10-24 08:05:04 Not really. Quick remonetisation post demonetisation pain, negating both. Economy almost heading to 91 level crisis. Unproductive social spending, CAD, oil shock, foreign policy etc replay of Rajiv Gandhi days with full central bank cooperation. Worst is ahead of us.

8788 2018-10-24 08:04:05 The nay-sayers dependent on Big Oil money keep spruiking to media "it won't work".

They are missing the point....

Friday isn't supposed to instantly reduce the pump price of fuel. 

Friday is the start of the revolution not the pinnacle.

8789 2018-10-24 08:03:40 I almost got boiling hot cooking oil in my eye, Odin of willful ignorance.
8790 2018-10-24 08:03:21 Hello dear, it’s an oil and its supposed to be used minimally and also it has this roll-on cover so you just used it like a roll-on  do you get?
8791 2018-10-24 08:03:04 Ocean and oil (in full).
8792 2018-10-24 08:03:04 I’m hoping that by the end of a 3yr pcp with the leaf I’ll have lots of nice options from Europe. A Neo gti or electric Skoda VRS should be options at that stage... better to get out of the oil burner now while it has some trade in value!
8793 2018-10-24 08:02:49 "Add oil," a literal translation of the Mandarin term "jiā yóu (加油)," which is used as a cheer, or form of encouragemen and support, has been included as an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary. #AddOil!

I think it works different for different people.
My hair is softer, holds moisture better, grows healthier out my scalp and I have curl pattern.
The coconut oil worked well till it didn't do it anymore.
8798 2018-10-24 08:02:20 i’m way too scary to use castor oil i’d rather just have to get induced at the hospital
8799 2018-10-24 08:02:01 State tax is different. Diff of rs. 3 to 4 is due to transportation cost. Coz other factor like crude oil cost, refinery costare , central tax & state tax(state tax may vary state to state) would be same.

8810 2018-10-24 08:00:24 I was being sarcastic and thought it should be obvious... For some reason you seen to think that because plastic resins use oil means we should keep burning coal for power. I have no idea how that follows.

8816 2018-10-24 07:59:16 He was killed as an example for all critical press in SA. And it was stupid indeed, they though their oil money would keep them out of trouble (as it always did before). Luckily due to public outrage, SA is finally held accountable.

8829 2018-10-24 07:56:11 The trouble is the lies told in 2014 & since about how little the oil was/is worth did, has & will significantly undermine investment in offshore infrastructure & investment in exploration to the detriment of jobs and the Scottish economy & to the wider UK.

8839 2018-10-24 07:54:35 So, as I suspected, not so clean, they offset the carbon by pushing it into the ground to lift oil so it can be burnt in cars. And then there’s the cat stuff of digging a big hole in the earth, using power to run the machinery, polluting the water tables. The list goes on.

8864 2018-10-24 07:50:02 For many years I worked for the Oil & Gas industry. Not all is bad and, yes, there is still a massive demand for fossil fuels that won’t just evaporate.
BUT.
To invest in fracking and not it perfectly viable clean alternative energy sources is infernally criminal.

8897 2018-10-24 07:43:34 What is the use of being in a federal system if the state could not be helped by the federal? Better not to be in the federal itself. Break free and stand alone. The oil is good enough to keep the state machinery running.
8898 2018-10-24 07:43:27 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.

8918 2018-10-24 07:40:39 But I don't think we buy oil from Saudi Arabia - we buy from other sources such as Norway. This is about arms sales only (I think).

8928 2018-10-24 07:40:11 Other than that, there is an oil import package from KSA worth $3 Billion on deferred payments for three consecutive years. A total oil import package of worth $9 billion.

8937 2018-10-24 07:39:14 [I heard my phone ping on the bench. My head turned then I looked back to finish pulling the oil plug out and put a drip tray under it before cleaning my hands and getting up to check my msg.

@BBCScotland 
"Up to £330 billion could yet be spent extracting oil and gas from the North Sea by 2050"
not what it would earn you understand but what it would cost!
8941 2018-10-24 07:38:45 use it all the time, such a versatile oil

8943 2018-10-24 07:38:38 That figure isn't even the value of the oil itself, just how much needs to be spent to get it out the ground. 17bn barrels of oil at $80 a barrel is $1.36 trillion. Stop selling the rights and create a national oil company, drill it ourselves.
8944 2018-10-24 07:38:36 'Worked for Berezovsky & Abramovich's oil company. [...] became minister in charge of climate change.' - beyond parody.

8952 2018-10-24 07:37:06 Again, Hope u understand d difference between a company shutting down as against divestment?
Exxon Mobil divested 60% equity in its Mobil Oil Nigeria (it's downstream arm involved in retail and marketing, not E&P) to Nipco, to focus more on upstream operations in deeper waters
8953 2018-10-24 07:37:04 @realDonaldTrump They will increase oil output on November. They want your indulgence. I think that Khashoggi assasination are part of a plan. A distraction maneuver, an plan how to increase oil prices and Aramco capitalization.  They need Aramco IPO.

8955 2018-10-24 07:36:33 Agree, 103 will provide all the funds needed esp if Mengo and lower comes in as we hope. Cln is in place for contingency so that they can then drill 104. A lot do not read what is in front of them. Still all on target and plan for a lot of oil, #AAOG @angloafricanog
8956 2018-10-24 07:36:33 Oil and Gas supply is essential for industrialization much as industries need enegry to operate.

8967 2018-10-24 07:35:25 No no @SibandaSibbs. The products were not banned. There is still imported cooking oil, juice and all in the shops. Just you and me couldn't just import. We needed to get a licence which wasn't easy to get.
8968 2018-10-24 07:35:22 Of course he did. The health of our planet and every living creature has been auctioned to the OIL, Gas, Chemical, Banking industries and the Republican Party’s most loyal donors. #VoteBlue. We can fight back.

8975 2018-10-24 07:33:56 Oil gave up recent gains following reports that Saudi Arabia could supply more crude quickly if needed, easing concerns ahead of impending US sanctions on Iran.

8997 2018-10-24 07:30:40 What generally as an average that amount of oil translates to a companys £cap at current oil prices
8998 2018-10-24 07:30:34 Low oil prices in an oil dependant economy made the nation poor. 

Using the forex earned for oil sales to subsidise imported goods made the nation poor.

Being an economy that dwells on importation without local products has made us poor.

Buhari did not make us poor.

9043 2018-10-24 07:20:57 So if we stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia we lose ‘influence’. They know that (and likely don’t care). So we don’t have any influence anyway. As usual this is about oil & money #r4today

9052 2018-10-24 07:19:04 I'd argue "real profits tax with no loopholes to make billions disappear" would be a better name. I know tech is all the rage these days, but they just extended on the aggressive fiscal strategies that large companies (such as banks themselves or oil companies) pioneered
9053 2018-10-24 07:19:04 I once wrote about this somewhere. As long as the politically connected elite have a direct line to national resources, Nigeria will only change if the masses disrupt things. This is because Nigeria's oil, gas and solid minerals guarantee wealth for a century.
9054 2018-10-24 07:18:47 Just 15 years ago Bush administration, John Bolton & Republicans made case for invading Iraq to bring democracy, paid by the Oil.

9085 2018-10-24 07:13:13 The issue would not be lost exports but how Saudi retaliates with oil production. Increase or decrease in production will have differing pain and risks.
9086 2018-10-24 07:13:13 That’s ok. Just fry it a little with garlic & fresh basil, bit of salt & pepper. Extra virgin olive oil that is.

9183 2018-10-24 06:56:31 An obvious case of corporatism: Big Oil (5 corporations)telling 7.4 million Washington citizens they are not allowed to tax themselves.

9201 2018-10-24 06:54:06 When I used to have natural hair the cheapest and best moisturiser was olive oil. It kept my hair so soft.
9202 2018-10-24 06:53:53 In two weeks we'll know if Cruz is the true embodiment of Texas men or not. The oil and gas industry has conditioned them to bow their heads and check their testicles at the door. Cruz did it for the likes of Trump.
9203 2018-10-24 06:53:52 The illegals trudging toward our southern border were hijacked via Socialist, oil rich, yet destitute Venezuela with George Soros & his Dem stooges waiting in the wings to assist the dangerous masses.

Check the level of USA debt profile.past leaders have just been comfortable with oil money & never tot of borrowing large to build infrastructure

9214 2018-10-24 06:52:30 I would @angloafricanog #AAOG would have needed some finance in place to secure the rig option. Hit oil, i'll expect us to raise at a higher price c.20p and this facility made redundant. Lets hope and see....

9223 2018-10-24 06:51:31 That Canadian figure is the out of the ground price and doesn't take into account the refining, shipping, etc costs to bring it to the same condition as the WTI oil. I agree buying local would be great, but it's not apples to apples in this case.

9229 2018-10-24 06:50:58 Yesterday #Talat was asking if PM says "we r desperate for loans", then who will invest in Pakistan, after a couple of hours breaking news came from KSA of 12 billion $ bail out package & oil refinery in Pakistan.
Note: Talat is the one who said #IK would be the last person
9230 2018-10-24 06:50:28 The discounted oil has ZERO to do with the listed pipelines, none of which would have been flowing by now.

A former senator should know that.

Just after putting on new clothes, bursting crackers wl take prominence.Only fireworks like buswanam, surusuruvarthi,chakram wl b burst during night
9232 2018-10-24 06:50:21 I need to stop bullshitting and oil my scalp.
9233 2018-10-24 06:50:20 Scheer, you think you've got Justin all figured out but your only plan is to break Canada up into warring pieces to be absorbed by your oil billionaire American donors. You are a traitor who sponges off taxpayers & should be arrested as such.
9234 2018-10-24 06:50:20 It sounds well for those dams to be built for development like many other projects are taking off, oil in Hoima,phosphates and many cement factories in Tororo.The local content issue should be taken serious for good public relations with the indigenous.Exclusion not fruitful
9235 2018-10-24 06:50:16 Thank you for posting this tweet. I had not heard of Kratom before. On Monday I had the 3 carpel bones in my left hand removed & the pain is worse than labor pain even with the strongest painkillers & CBD/THC oil combo. Please post your reviews of it.

9242 2018-10-24 06:49:09 I completely disagree Maria my friend. He is the PM & $3b loan & $3b oil deferred payment is a poor Sum to sell out the poor destitute innocent ppl in #Yemen targeted by Saud. What will IK have to do for the funds? Send troops - it’s not for free Ouzobillah sickening 
9243 2018-10-24 06:48:52 Well, naturally. Expediency 'trumps' all else. After all, oil, real estate and weapons matter much more than lives lost. Bottomline: the cruel Saudis are a bulwark against the evil enemy: Iran and the looming Shia sphere of influence in Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Bahrain.

9265 2018-10-24 06:45:25 I need some oil paints.
9266 2018-10-24 06:45:18 The oil price is the consequence of the ability to pump and to finance pumping facilities. You can pump out very fast from a barrel, even if it is nearly empty. Yet if it is empty, prices will go up very fast.

My opinion, from time it was reported, all involved had a responsibility.

9322 2018-10-24 06:34:26 Sleep? Why no. You don't need to sleep! Says the pinched nerve in my back. And the garlic oil helps. Hubs says I smell like bread sticks. but there's just enough stabby pain left to keep me up.

9333 2018-10-24 06:33:09 Ziauddin Sahib, not possible to keep these Affairs secret if they monitor your inflows n outflows. Remember DrHafizPasha & MoenAfzal we’re sacked in 1998 for revealing Saudi oil facility to IMF!
9334 2018-10-24 06:33:03 Of course. What I meant was the credit line would give Pakistan breathing space on the current account deficit, whatever the oil price. Machinery imports are already dropping fast upon completion of CPEC early harvest projects. Export numbers are modestly encouraging.

9338 2018-10-24 06:32:17 Where is the nation's respect which he usually mentioned to his audience? He is following the same path like previou head of the state but you no need to worry because he managed to beg the money from KSA for your salary and also oil for your bike.

9362 2018-10-24 06:29:57 Hm. 20 years is an understatement. they have about 80 years for their oil reserves to deplete. 80 years!
They also depend heavily on tourism for revenue (Mecca and Medina). So till the world shifts to alternative energy, this weak but powerful country will continue to fool 
9363 2018-10-24 06:29:44 Managed to revive my hair back to health with a dollar store charcoal shampoo & conditioner, olive oil heat treatment, and I moisturized with a basic moisturizer and grease.

9366 2018-10-24 06:29:23 Peace God. Burning that midnight oil?
9367 2018-10-24 06:29:07 So actually, yes the part about helping the current account is correct as it would be for any loan - the link to oil prices rising/falling is not a part of this.
9368 2018-10-24 06:29:06 Wait.. Do y'all really know what you are voting for? Or do you really u derstand the economics of your decision. Dem or Rep, the Saudis have the US over a barrel economically. 3m barrel drop in oil production would send the US economy in a downward spiral. Check it out
9369 2018-10-24 06:28:56 Industry experts @aberdeenuni estimate up to £330 Billion could be spent on extracting oil and gas from UK waters in the next 30 years. 
Details from @BBCDouglasF #bbcgms 0735
9370 2018-10-24 06:28:39 This year. But he has borrowed money for two more years of $3 Bn worth of oil for another two years. Hence debt goes from 95 to 107.
9371 2018-10-24 06:28:36 Oil in USD link to gas is dire for gas users if sustained, and dreadful for electricity prices if gas gen keeps setting price. Other sources of flex are urgent, as long as they are cheaper overall. Change in facts on ground more likely to break link than threats

9418 2018-10-24 06:19:59 I don’t represent the oil industry. I’m not paid by them. And I am also astonished that people continue to argue for a ban on NZ exploration without being making a robust case for how the ban actually reduces emissions.

Do you not care at all whether policy will work?
9419 2018-10-24 06:19:42 Not even. It was, then Trump was elected. Now he wants to screw over regular people with snake oil pitches about healthcare he is going to plan on taking away.
9420 2018-10-24 06:19:35 US dismissed concerns that oil prices LCOc1 could rise, saying the market had already factored in the supply losses.

9464 2018-10-24 06:13:02 It's a good investment. People always need to eat. Stocks, oil, gold create gaps for foreign govt manipulation. A more balanced portfolio is needed. Food & water are undervalued commodities.

9498 2018-10-24 06:08:32 That brings back many memories, especially the Midnight Oil “warm-up” gigs that they did when in town in the 80s.
9499 2018-10-24 06:08:31 My prognosis is that if the craze for oil subsides in a global post-oil economy, we could see peace returning to West Asia including  and. I believe could see that within our lifetime.

9529 2018-10-24 06:03:39 And it gets worse, now do the math on where a bbl of heavy oil is actually priced at the wellhead, considering WCS is a heavy oil/condensate blend.  Expect only US$10-15/bbl for heavy oil at current prices.  This is hurting everyone....badly!

9607 2018-10-24 05:52:59 The West's preoccupation with not offending Saudi Arabia has a long history & goes beyond oil and arms. The roots lie in the notion that it is the powerful voice of the true bedouin- the centre of Islam in the Orientalist tradition, reaching back into medieval Christianity.
9608 2018-10-24 05:52:21 @KirkSpano Hi Kirk - What do you make of this meltdown in oil over the last week ? Are you still bullish ?

9616 2018-10-24 05:51:24 At 9 million barrels per day in imports, China has so much domestic demand (for consumption and stockpiling), that it won’t have any need to re-export that oil as implied by a few folks here. Those barrels can be cleared out of bonded storage overnight as an import. Quick deal.

9738 2018-10-24 05:30:17 Some have done well with 30k, some haven't. Someone I know in an oil company, receiving 500k, has just been picked up by the police and his car taken by one bank for debt.

so that we will reduce cure oil usage.

9750 2018-10-24 05:27:57 80+% of the world's pop want energy now, and cheaply, and they don't care how they get it, and their govts will get it for them.  That means 1600 coal fired gen stations on the books in 2017, 120mm/b/d oil by 2040.  Best thing we can do is get them Can energy.

9759 2018-10-24 05:26:02 Same here.

In 2013/2014, the price of oil in AUD was about 20% higher than it is now. At the same time, the fuel price was around $1.50 per litre, and even that was ripoff.

Australians getting ripped off as always.

9763 2018-10-24 05:25:10 Not to dismiss your point sir, but this is Nigeria. A country that heavily relies on oil (when largest oil country doesn't), just out of recession officially, with election by the corner (people need to observe the economy at such times)...the odds are higher than the chances.
9764 2018-10-24 05:24:58 The rupee recovered by 42 paise to 73.15 against the United States currency in early trade on Wednesday on fresh dollar selling by exporters amid easing crude oil prices and higher opening in the domestic equity markets.

9766 2018-10-24 05:24:52 Pakistan imports 110,000 barrels of crude per day from Saudi Arabia. Taken at the current price, the oil imports from the kingdom amount to around $3bn in a year.

 I just forgot to buy it.

Or go to the game.


9769 2018-10-24 05:24:10 Asian stocks edged lower on Wednesday as concerns, ranging from worries about U.S. corporate earnings to Middle East tensions, weighed on sentiment while crude oil approached two-month lows after Saudi Arabia flagged possible supply increases.
9770 2018-10-24 05:24:02 You're correct, that's why the incompetent General is keeping Naija & Kaduna in peace, criminal integrity - instead of showing security expertise he's showing crude oil expertise - petroleum minister, clueless General.

9778 2018-10-24 05:22:27 Yes, it’s because US has been raising their rates more than CAD. So our CAD$ falls behind. US is forecasted to raise more than CAD going forward also, which will again deteriorate our CAD$ spending power. Our dollar tied to oil and stuck with no pipelines hurts it also.
9779 2018-10-24 05:22:23 Oil prices on Wednesday clawed back some of their hefty losses from the day before as the looming U.S. sanctions against Iran came back into focus.

9805 2018-10-24 05:19:10 US appears to be finding alternatives to India for support to deal with China. Result of India's ambivalent approach and inaction on US demands inspite of US coercion.  Maybe lesser support on H1B, anti Pak, and maybe even sanctions on S 400/ Iran oil issues

9820 2018-10-24 05:17:16 Shit an oil change shouldn’t even take that long
9821 2018-10-24 05:17:12 If we really want our country to be strong against dollar we should decrease import oil by introducing electric vehicles. Government should give tax benefits to electric vehicle. And setup solar power charging units. By this  our import bill go down and rs. become stronger

9837 2018-10-24 05:15:08 Further, should pressure trends on oil continue, we could very well see further decreases per barrel. This would then drop price at the pump further - then with next years excise increase. It will still be short of the ATH under National.

9855 2018-10-24 05:13:03 In contrast, the trade deficit from 2013-17 shows a clearly rising trend. From about $15b in 2013-12 to around 24b in 2015-16. And then $32.5b in 2016-17. All this despite record low oil prices in 2015 and EU GSP facility given in 2014

9870 2018-10-24 05:10:37 87% of Saudi revenue is oil..any disruption to price or supply and their economy is toast. Western investment is crucial for the economy. No one wants to be caught investing now that the western media smell a story. Even Lockheed are nervous.

9884 2018-10-24 05:08:18 LOL EXACTLY. In the weeks they were calling for $100, $200, oil started to decline and collapse. Also in the weeks they were calling for lower oil $65, $50, oil started to rise and skyrocket to $80. Smh. Wall st oil, one of the best contrarion indicator.

9929 2018-10-24 05:02:05 As oil prices are surging across the globe, demand for crude oil is increasing as well. The U.S. is currently the lead exporter of crude oil, and new fracking practices are being tested to increase exports further - what impacts will these have on our environment?

9958 2018-10-24 04:57:36 I think it will take out smaller companies, and when they go bankrupt, it may lead to more orphans. I think the answer for that issue lies more toward better bonding requirements. Both WY & UT went that route after the oil crash left them w orphan wells.
