5 2018-03-13 23:58:59 I went to school with Gord Gillies. Contacted him about some crap going on here with the oil sands and leaks into the Athabasca River which is a drinking water supply for FN. Nothing. Caribou in the Boreal losing their habitat. Nothing.
6 2018-03-13 23:58:41 Why is it so hard for you to comprehend that Alberta oil IS having trouble competing on the world market? 
US production has increased - they don't need as much AB oil. 
Eastern Canada is importing, because we have no pipelines to ship to the east. (not a new issue)

15 2018-03-13 23:56:58 In the "No Tariff" era oil went from 35 cents in 1992 to $4. Perhaps we should try tariffs (foreigners footing the bill) instead of domestic taxes (Americans footing the bill)?

I asked you valid questions on where you expect the Alberta oil market to be, when companies can only ship to the US at a discount - you couldn't answer that. 
I also asked you why you think those same companies should put more money

42 2018-03-13 23:55:42 That's true, oil companies are slowly diversifying to other forms of energy to ensure sustainability
43 2018-03-13 23:55:35 inject coconut oil into your heart. fucking. jam it in there. fuck. fucking. bathe in it. stick your face in it. fucking. coconut oil RAW
44 2018-03-13 23:55:31 Oil is a tiny % of electricity generation. The "green" crap you mentioned is a huge failure at a gigantic cost. See Spain, Germany, Ontario, etc. Trillions invested, no results except energy poverty.

What the fuck is going on over there??
48 2018-03-13 23:55:07 Trump’s not a conservative and you have been duped by a snake oil salesman. I remember when the GOP actually stood for morals and conservative principles. Trump does not so if you support him please start your own party.

50 2018-03-13 23:55:05 Why would we want to be an oil producer? Be a leader in clean solar and wind energy. You're destroying a healthy job market and our planet at the same time.
51 2018-03-13 23:55:03 What a freakin disaster. America doesn’t benefit from that Canadian oil. That pipeline is simply to facilitate moving the oil to the refinerys.
52 2018-03-13 23:54:56 Please join Arnie in his case. I'm all for you loons suing oil companies over global warming. That would finally require FACTS and you would have to PROVE global warming exists and that oil companies knew about it and are causing it.

54 2018-03-13 23:54:22 How about you guys spend a day in a coal mines or in an oil field in July?????
55 2018-03-13 23:54:18 Tillerson was hired because he knew oil and knew Russia. That's done.

Now he's fired because he's speaking harshly of Russia. Plus, Pompeo is a much better choice to ensure the upcoming "talks" with North Korea go as bumpy as possible.
56 2018-03-13 23:54:06 I'm due for an oil change and tire rotation 
57 2018-03-13 23:54:06 Soooo exactly how many millions is a dog’s life worth these days?

59 2018-03-13 23:53:57 He was in it for Russian oil money. When he failed to deliver, he was worthless to trump and Russia has lots of kompromat. #Rosneft
60 2018-03-13 23:53:54 Obama liked the internet. Whale oil and a buggy whip shop combo in a brick and mortar retail presence should be an investment that would interest Rep Ryan and Sen. McConnell! AND Closed on Sundays.
61 2018-03-13 23:53:47 G this lady arguing with this man cause she want oil on her feet before he paint them???? G what let him paint them before he put oil on your nail g
62 2018-03-13 23:53:36 Yes, and to huge oil, but inept and wrongheaded as he was, I think he came to understand that his former friend, Putin,  is a shit.
63 2018-03-13 23:53:28 And again, where exactly is the market for Alberta oil, when the only place we can ship to is the US, who is buying it at a discount? Why would companies put money into higher production, when they can't sell it for a good price?
64 2018-03-13 23:53:27 Thank you @MayorPugh50 for being a #climateleader and signing the #wearestillin pledge. Will you follow through and sign the Crude Oil Terminal Prohibition? #StopOilTrains @CCANActionFund
65 2018-03-13 23:53:23 Our weakness re: oil and gas is in its proportional contribution to our exports. Its contribution to GDP is more modest.
66 2018-03-13 23:53:14 Jeremy, we have a perfect storm. Even The oil co's are getting screwed by the rail lines trying to tie them in to long term contracts or they get what they get. Western rail service is completely fubared and the government could fix it. They could split #billc49 #moveourgrain

73 2018-03-13 23:52:00 . @MSNBC spent months talking down Tillerson - oil CEO, ties to Putin (oil & award), crappy handling of State, etc. Now? "He was a decent guy treated disrespectfully by Trump." He's a big boy, knew who he laid down with. Glad he's gone. These CEO's know nothing about running gov.
74 2018-03-13 23:51:57 right! Emirates & Saudi are our proud rebels for free of speech & apostasy inalienable Human Right Yeah ! everybody with us. Youth in E have problem to understand how oil monarchies act. Their wealth is inversely proportional to their protection of freedom of thought or speech
75 2018-03-13 23:51:46 Any good remedies for arthritis pain? I have tried glucosamine and fish oil both.
76 2018-03-13 23:51:40 The Obama administration turned over $1.7 B worth of foreign currency to the Iranian regime that was owed to them from the arms sale that busted when the Ayatollah took over.  The rest was from oil sales made prior to 2015 sanctions.
77 2018-03-13 23:51:39 TaX  scam will cause massive deficit. He's placed our Social Security and Medicare plans in jeopardy. He's allowing the EPA to run amok. He's allowing big oil to spoil our land. He allowed Russia to interfere with our elections and still no sactions. Deregulation. List goes on.

81 2018-03-13 23:50:51 just one more GoldmanSacks/CIA/Rothschild operative one less Oil industry operative in the administration 
wont change much in eventual outcome will just bring about war with China and Russia that much sooner
82 2018-03-13 23:50:49 This is pure delusion. Oil demand is at an all time record high.
83 2018-03-13 23:50:37 Totally Blue Hoosier.  Yes he didnt do any good.  He did a great job of cutting the state dept, not filling ambassadors, degrading the dept standing in the world, and probably opened the door to get sanctions dropped and oil opened in Russia.
84 2018-03-13 23:50:22 He wasn't too fibrous. Must be the olive oil in their diet.
85 2018-03-13 23:50:09 I just overheard so much vocal fry in a conversation between two women at the gym that if oil and potatoes were available we could have shared a nice crispy post-workout treat. #StopElongatingYourWords
86 2018-03-13 23:49:55 I bet Tillerson goes back to Oil and makes bank with Russian oil ..
87 2018-03-13 23:49:48 Instead twice a day I have been massaging Peoria murafeca oil into them which is supposed to make them bigger lol okay I spelled it wrong but whatever

92 2018-03-13 23:49:32 We aren't going to have a country soon anyway, with you giving power to Russians, and Zinke selling the rest to oil/mining corporations.
93 2018-03-13 23:49:32 They found significant oil deposits... lol
94 2018-03-13 23:49:27 Oil began the big plummet in mid-2014 but it was a year before the industry had to admit that it had the appearances of being "permanent" and adjusted accordingly (cost-reductions, consolidation, etc.). Now it's "steady-state" in relative terms.
95 2018-03-13 23:49:26 The Chinese and Russians have already won reconstruction contracts. Russia will develop oil field.
96 2018-03-13 23:49:07 Yo @POTUS , you look like somebody dipped you in left over chorizo oil.
97 2018-03-13 23:49:02 What's neem oil? Sounds like a nice and simple mix 
98 2018-03-13 23:48:34 Really. Why is that. You don’t care about Eastern Canada buying oil from despots. Why not use Canadian oil?
99 2018-03-13 23:48:24 Exactly!  I grew up hating the leafs & habs.  I have a provincial rivalry which is mighty strong and beating the lames is a wonderful feeling that has no description.  There is no joy in celebrating an injury.  GO OIL!
100 2018-03-13 23:48:22 Meng, Body Shop tea tree oil. One dose does it! #ALDUBWorthTheFight
101 2018-03-13 23:48:13 I love oven roasted cauliflower brains with sea salt and olive oil!
102 2018-03-13 23:48:12 In the oven with a tiny bit of olive oil on them to bake and get crisp. Then put smoked paprika, red pepper salt and a little pepper.
103 2018-03-13 23:48:04 They wanted good PR. Shell supported it and axed the Cameron creek oil sands project shortly after. This is after this already invested 2 billion.
104 2018-03-13 23:48:02 Yep, it’s called maintenance. Oil wells need maintenance too, as do gas well, refineries and pipelines. Anything else?
105 2018-03-13 23:48:00 Give them a go - supplements best & easiest - done me the power of good (though shoulder kicking off again at the moment but that maybe coz I've started dead weight lifting...) & omega 3,6 & 9 oil's
106 2018-03-13 23:47:38 This oil is working lile magic and its only been 3 days 
107 2018-03-13 23:47:16 I get an extra 2.50 on my check to help me buy a fucking skittles packet, South Korea and North Korea met, he didn’t do shit, Israel and Saudi Arabia haven’t done shit about terrorism, saudis are concerned with oil refineries and Israel is concerned with their own protection
108 2018-03-13 23:46:50 If ancient romans saw spray olive oil would they just spray that shit all over themselves
109 2018-03-13 23:46:50 Why peanut oil so expensive Lord?
110 2018-03-13 23:46:37 Really terrible. AFAIK, that 50% export figure is plain wrong. I'm fairly sure the US is our biggest export market. I don't know about energy, but oil & gas aren't only forms. Re perishable goods, would it really take that much longer to go around GB, or via France, vs across GB?
111 2018-03-13 23:46:18 2/ can access markets other than the US (who we sell oil to at a discount) was never a priority until now. Perhaps you could also explain how the UCP plan of cuts will create jobs. Oh, and maybe you could explain how Kenney's threat of shutting off pipelines makes any company
112 2018-03-13 23:46:02 & yet; he’s actively seeking buyers 4 huge tracks of park land (oil prospectors) for multi millions which should negate the need to charge increased entrance fees
113 2018-03-13 23:45:57 Tillerson can get back to ramming oil tankers into Alaska.
114 2018-03-13 23:45:52 As that UBC article/study notes, the percentage of our exports that oil/gas represents has been increasing since the 1980s/90s.
115 2018-03-13 23:45:52 mac n cheese but you just add curry powders and coconut oil and whatever else

117 2018-03-13 23:45:35 I think I struck oil today...
118 2018-03-13 23:45:23 literally i lost my whole oil diffuser. the whole thing. it’s just gone.
119 2018-03-13 23:45:18 Might I suggest popcorn with good olive oil, salt and nutritional yeast flakes for the Pennsylvania special election results?
120 2018-03-13 23:45:16 @Honda 12 years ago i traded my repair prone audi for my 06 accord and i just crossed over 200,000 miles with no more than steady oil changes and standard repairs....thank you!!!
121 2018-03-13 23:45:15 I need an oil change
122 2018-03-13 23:45:04 Oil changes at no extra cost for two years! Just another reason why it's wise to shop with StreetWise.
123 2018-03-13 23:45:00 Venezuela is an example of mismanagement of a country not socialism. Venezuela relied on oil for 90% of its exports. Any country that does that will experience wild inflation and volatility regardless of economic system.
124 2018-03-13 23:44:57 As has been his fall-back line, when speaking with reporters, Trump came within a hair's breadth of saying he thought #Tillerson, previously the head of one of the world's largest oil companies, "is going to go on to do great things" but held himself back at the last moment.
125 2018-03-13 23:44:53 I don’t like pot. Can’t function or sleep. I’m using CBD oil
126 2018-03-13 23:44:48 Definitely press to get liquid out for at least 30 min. Cut into cubes pan fry in oil until crispy. Then simmer in brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic and ginger, rep pepper flakes. Add to rice w/ bok choy, peas, 1 scrambled egg. Voila tofu fried rice (kinda)

128 2018-03-13 23:44:26 Hello, you fab people how are we all going? I am kicking myself for running out of oil that's what I get for putting others first
129 2018-03-13 23:44:26 2 cups Greek yogurt, 1 tbsp salt, 1 1/2 tbsp b sugar, 3 cloves garlic, 1 tbsp cayenne,  2 tbsp olive oil, 3 limes juiced, 1 1/2 tbsp cumin, 2 tbsp paprika. Whisk .8 chic breast. Cut in half lengthwise. Cover in marinade overnight. Stack on wood skewer. On sheet pan bake 200 1hr
130 2018-03-13 23:44:12 Yes I live right here a block from the Gulf Coast.  After ten years they still are checking beaches for oil balls.
131 2018-03-13 23:44:06 Black men and cheating are like water and oil, they don't mix.
132 2018-03-13 23:44:06 1/ Good discussion & debate depends on providing information, not just emotion. 
Since you think you are so very smart, perhaps you could tell me why the major oil companies are all in favor of carbon pricing. Perhaps you could also explain why a pipeline to the coast so Alberta

150 2018-03-13 23:42:31 Ahh I have eczema on my forearm which is a nightmare with tan but just make sure you’re moisturised and exfoliated and if you need it removed because it’s showing up darker on dry skin coconut oil works! 
151 2018-03-13 23:42:23 Yeah, CBD oil won't get you high because there's no THC in it, but it definitely helps with many different ailments. Glad it helps you.
152 2018-03-13 23:42:14 I always do them in the oven. Boil them for a few minutes first, then toss in oil and bake around 400 TIL they’re done. Mmmmmm.

It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.

159 2018-03-13 23:41:22 There are unfortately still some vegans who eat palm oil, i did for a while myself. I rationalized that other vegans do it, and i feel horrible for it now....

Would his new found American friends save him? Nope.

189 2018-03-13 23:38:45 That is bullshit. They didn't have a "choice". They were doing what society told them to. What their part of society told them to do. A society dominated by powerful oil companies and right wing religious zealots.

238 2018-03-13 23:33:57 Hmmm that can be tough because you have a couple options. Sometimes oil combats oil. By using an oil based cleanser this helps cancel out the additional oil your skin makes because it recognizes that it’s hydrated enough. Sometimes you need to dry your excess oil out....

292 2018-03-13 23:25:46 If you catch veggies at one of our functions it got an OD amount of oil in it.
293 2018-03-13 23:25:28 And alllllll these oil deals in Africa!!!!
294 2018-03-13 23:25:20 I have been told in advance by my sources that no Russia leaking is forthcoming upon this Ferdinand-style ultimatum. I have however been told that everyone needs our gas and oil and so I expect this sorry shit show to blow over #hailtrumpmyjesus #newsnight

297 2018-03-13 23:24:53 West Texas smells like oil base and money
298 2018-03-13 23:24:46 I made a scrub with papaya, cantaloupe, salt, sugar, honey and lavender essential oil and I’m feeling so much better already 

On a side note though: my skin is literally PEELING off like after you sun burn but I haven’t been sunburnt in about two weeks...

This symbolism lol
299 2018-03-13 23:24:43 considering what and who he had to deal with, I thought Rex did far better than I expected. While CEO of Big Oil, he had deals with all sorts of international players, but the politics gave him problems, esp When President Moron would undo his work with a tweet.
300 2018-03-13 23:24:18 That's pretty fucktup.
301 2018-03-13 23:24:16 He killed millions are its wrong? why not left the job? Are its against democracy, when peoples are disliking your policies but you not come on election and diverting the issue by bombing , by power, cause you have support other, who want fulfill their own agenda, Gold, Oil etc.
302 2018-03-13 23:24:15 A little higher than that but as much as 25% of oil producing prov’s revenue.

304 2018-03-13 23:23:56 Does Rick Perry know what the VA does??? Don the Con wants a Completely Complicit Plant in Energy it has the Nukes Oil Gas !! Oh what a Russian/ Trump Party
305 2018-03-13 23:23:44 My Theory: Pompeo has taken more direct money from the Kochs than any other member of Congress, according to FEC filings. He’s there to figure a way to remove the Russian sanctions. Tillerson couldn’t get it done and the Kochs really want those untapped Russian oil fields.
306 2018-03-13 23:23:39 I took my car in for an oil change and half way done with my laundry. Progress.

This is no longer the case ( see record high Oil exports)

330 2018-03-13 23:20:20 Check the rocker panels for rust/filler, check the oil and make sure it's not milky, check the oil pressure at idle with a hot engine after pulling off the highway (make sure it's about ~15 psi). It'd be nice to run a compression test, too. 

Enjoy the test drive!
331 2018-03-13 23:20:06 I have been told that if you mix it with butter or coconut oil it can still give you a high! 
332 2018-03-13 23:19:57 There's a plethora of bad information out there. Depending on your goals 1700 cals could be perfectly fine. Ppl fear the "starvation response" which is a complete myth. Calories matters most. Carbs, fat, sugar, oil, etc are all fine in moderation as long as you hit cal goals.
333 2018-03-13 23:19:52 Oh yeah, that "fine-tuned" machine is barely moving and losing oil.
334 2018-03-13 23:19:44 Do anyone know a good vendor that sells the body fragrance oil called Lick Me All Over?

347 2018-03-13 23:18:02 well, i'd say it sounds pretty logical. Omega 6 rich vegetable oils totally ruin O3:O6 ratio which causes systemic inflammation. And inflammed people usually don't feel that good... People then try to overconsume fish oil, but it's way better to cut PUFA's in the first place.
348 2018-03-13 23:17:49 @THANK YOU, @SenWhitehouse for berating the @SenateGOP @HouseGOP & @POTUS Trump admin for refusing to address #ClimateChange! They ignore the threat, & bow to dark money from fossil fuel industries.

349 2018-03-13 23:17:18 I’ve heard it does but I wouldn’t try it just to be safe. I usually use a bit of tea tree oil before bed, it dries it up and comes off clean

437 2018-03-13 23:07:24 add red oil to it and dry fish to complete the process
438 2018-03-13 23:07:19 2018: the year I yelled “oh fuck, not him of all people!”! To an oil tycoon leaving White House staff. Who am I ? Who are we ?
439 2018-03-13 23:07:18 Gotta get an oil change Friday. I’m overdue

443 2018-03-13 23:06:46 @DonaldJTrumpJr you need to do something about that oil slick on your head.  #nasty
444 2018-03-13 23:06:37 Well first off it should be noted I'm an oil slick, so if you have dry skin my products may irritate it  HOWEVER...all the following steps I do twice a day:
445 2018-03-13 23:06:36 I really don't need to justify anything because public opinion puts the NDP in the dumpster. It's you who needs to convince me. This is what I see unemployment in Calgary sky high, 30% vacancy in Calgary offices, and oil & gas investment 62% lower than 2014 levels.
446 2018-03-13 23:06:24 I never believed in herb infused oil, until now. The only oil I have left in the cupboard is infused with Thai basil and lemongrass. Note: it does not work to make a dressing for a Greek salad.
447 2018-03-13 23:06:20 The film caster had to use castor oil on her skin. #550 #homophones
448 2018-03-13 23:06:17 I'm going to try a hot shower with lavender oil tonight and see if that doesn't send me off to sleep.
449 2018-03-13 23:06:09 Rick Perry was governor of Texas and we all knew he was dumb as dirt.  In Texas, white boys are rocketed to power by oil $ and family connections.

We always knew he would've flunked out of college without daddy bailing him out.
450 2018-03-13 23:05:58 But no peanut, despite there being peanut oil. Good news for those with peanut allergies!
451 2018-03-13 23:05:55 Ahaha it will it’s drenched in coconut oil 24/7

455 2018-03-13 23:05:48 ExxonMobil would have had a 33.3% stake of what was found  with the russian Rosneft Oil  russian deal ( 9 trillion dollars ). Sanctions make it a failed deal. Russia would have wanted trump to win to complete the deal. COLLUSION.
456 2018-03-13 23:05:46 If you have olive oil, give it a go. I find fancy face oils to light—and too expensive. Grocery store is your friend.

459 2018-03-13 23:05:01 Don’t think I’ve ever waited this long for an oil change smh
460 2018-03-13 23:04:56 I have not tried the delta products but buy from Herbal D too. I was loving the Quarry honey oil ones as my first jump into the oil pond. They are out of stock mostly and since find other options. I am so glad to hear you found something to hit that pain, not easy I am sure!
461 2018-03-13 23:04:50 if solar and wind are indeed cheaper than oil why do they need $2 billion of subsidies from the government?
462 2018-03-13 23:04:47 It’s a conflagration of a few key things. Was fear of fat and flooding of high carb low fat products. And what fat there was was fake fat seed oil full of LA. Still don’t know what this does to us. Way more Snacking more hunger. As @tednaiman says futher from steak+eggs more prob
463 2018-03-13 23:04:23 Torrence, Canada’s Feminist Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that oppress WOMEN. Obstructing  FEMINIST OIL = oppressing Women. @MikeSmythNews @kenthehr @VaughnPalmer

465 2018-03-13 23:04:20 A lot of y’all females got a lot of mileage .. you gotta check the car fax these days .. some of y’all might need an oil change these days
466 2018-03-13 23:04:04 I’ll need to get an oil change Saturday if I can get down there early enough
467 2018-03-13 23:04:03 I could list all those numbers for you, but you would blame everything on oil prices.
468 2018-03-13 23:03:55 Hm should I start an oil painting
469 2018-03-13 23:03:48 It's probably because of that time you broke into her house and stole her cooking oil
470 2018-03-13 23:03:25 War ( if that`s the plan ) has always dictated the price of oil
471 2018-03-13 23:03:22 You don’t know who “they” is. Trump is the snake and his oil, piss. You’ll buy every last drop. What you’ve said here is foolish in the extreme.

474 2018-03-13 23:03:11 Your MCM runs from oil when frying plantain.
475 2018-03-13 23:03:02 And got walked all over by them in Syria, sold them uranium and by killing oil and gas drilling by the usa with regular, handed the Russians the global market.  Saudi and Russia LOVE those regs, boosted their biz by BILLIONS
476 2018-03-13 23:03:02 Everytime I spread peppermint castor oil over my eyebrows I plead the blood of Jesus and claim that my eyebrows will come back thicker then ever.
477 2018-03-13 23:02:59 ooooh the problem with sesame oil is that I would just be hungry all day. But I admit it never crossed my mind to just use ordinary oils and not special face oils.
478 2018-03-13 23:02:54 They do if you eat anything with a high fat content, yes, apparently! They stop your body absorbing oil and fat, so it has only one place to go!

488 2018-03-13 23:01:46 They're hardly irrelevant, and they don't count the oil we produce that gets burned elsewhere. I'm not saying turn off the taps tomorrow, but delaying the transition anymore is insane. Pricing one component of making a transition work.

495 2018-03-13 23:01:15 This is absolute bullshit by oil cos.
496 2018-03-13 23:01:12 Wipe the oil off your forehead and rub it on yo lips like you did earlier in lab
497 2018-03-13 23:01:11 If your skin is prone to inflamation, coconut or jojoba oil is good. Since my skin is just bone dry and flaky (eyebrow dandruff? really?) I use raw sesame oil.
498 2018-03-13 23:01:08 Depends on the pan / hob but generally about 20 mins on low to medium flame and keep turning it. It doesn’t need a lot of oil at all.
499 2018-03-13 23:01:08 The way the Republicans ended their investigation is like my mechanic telling me he's done and I drive away with no oil in the engine, one lugnut on each wheel, and my muffler hanging off.
500 2018-03-13 23:01:05 When the former CEO of Exxon mobil, Rex Tillerson, was chosen as secretary of state, the left pointed to a Russian oil contract with Exxon stopped by Obama, & claimed that Tillerson's selection was evidence of collusion. Now his firing is also evidence of collusion...
501 2018-03-13 23:01:02 I ahree and they will soon because they don’t need our oil.
502 2018-03-13 23:00:55 Or alternatively war footing on Europe’s borders and lots of missile fingers hovering - sell Dax and Oil and buy Gold

505 2018-03-13 23:00:03 I love this tactic from the pro fossil fuel folks. It is obvious which side profits "lavishly" from refining and selling oil. I wouldn't care if Gore owned shares in Exxon.  Attack his argument, not his bank balance.

510 2018-03-13 22:59:30 Coconut oil works for my body and as a makeup remover, but not as an actual facial moisturizer.
511 2018-03-13 22:59:16 Do you use beard oil? Asking for myself.
512 2018-03-13 22:59:12 i wanna know who said coconut oil was good for you when we uncovered all these bad things about it huh??
513 2018-03-13 22:59:07 Things I will never understand: recipes that have you brown beef and then wipe out the pan and add a bit of oil before cooking the veggies. WHY WOULD YOU WASTE THAT BEAUTIFUL GOODNESS.
514 2018-03-13 22:58:58 My financial advisor clued me in, become the CEO of the largest public oil company in the world and THEN sell my equity upon resignation for a brief stint as secretary of state. No cap gains.

517 2018-03-13 22:58:14 we know that if we enter a world war Israel will simply hold onto and annex gholin heights oil

My face has been so dry these past 2 days and I've been here confused because I have great skin. Picked up my "face wash" and it's actually hair gel/oil...
This company makes the hair & skin products and all their packaging is almost identical. I played myself.
519 2018-03-13 22:57:55 so i decided i would treat my hair to a coconut hair mask and i’ve just gone to wash it out and TURNS OUT a FUkn water pipe or something has burst and we have NO HOT WATER and i have SO MUCH coconut oil in my hair and to top it off have work at SEVEN tomorrow morning

526 2018-03-13 22:57:16 I found that oiling my dry skin *before* I wash it works very well. The cleanser takes off the excess oil, leaving just what you need. and by oiling, I mean oilslick, not a light dab.

528 2018-03-13 22:57:09 @MichaelBerrySho @RamonRoblesJr Bet your boots Tillerson negotiated with what was best for Exxon. Keeping Iran happy is good for oil.
529 2018-03-13 22:57:08 More importantly, the ExxonMobil-Russia $500b oil deal is dead. Treason is exhausting, Rex wants to move on with his life.

531 2018-03-13 22:57:03 That is my greatest fear for my son who is non verbal. I pray and put drops of blessed oil on his head every time he is away from me. I know no one is going to look after him the byway I do. This breaks my heart and makes my heart bleed for this family.
532 2018-03-13 22:57:02 @DogCannameds Hi there. Are there any case studies on the usage of CBD Oil for #FrenchBulldogs ? Mainly for eye and hip issues.

558 2018-03-13 22:52:49 We may have a potential 300billion barrels of recoverable oil reserves with tech improvements in extraction.

577 2018-03-13 22:50:41 I’m exhausted asf and I’m just now leaving work and I have to get an oil change before I can go home, the amount of money I spent today was also bullshit like I won’t even acknowledge my family when I get home I’m that fucking exhausted

579 2018-03-13 22:50:07 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
580 2018-03-13 22:50:00 If oil companies are responsible for air pollution, so do cars, airplanes, motorcycles, etc., are responsible too. The only solution is go live in caves like the Flintstones.

585 2018-03-13 22:49:43 I didn’t like her, not one bit but she’s brilliant. Let’s see if she embraces Pompeo? Tillerson, it was all about the oil tanker with her name on it but an embrace of the bomb thrower Pompeo.....
586 2018-03-13 22:49:08 What about the blood of innocent people who died in Turkey because of PKK and supported from Syria. 
If you don't block me,let's think about the possibilities if we don't stop, where YPG goes?If I say you're giving support to ypg for oil, you have more resources,you don't need it
587 2018-03-13 22:48:59 And dinosaurs are oil now...
588 2018-03-13 22:48:58 Yeah. Be a sucker. Buy this unregulated snake oil. It's your money, until it's theirs. #bogushealth #snakeoil
589 2018-03-13 22:48:57 I just found out that I've been putting hair oil on my FACE for the past 2 days 
590 2018-03-13 22:48:47 If environment's doomed we're all doomed - why worry about a little extra tax? We're a major oil producer and that's where much of our emissions come from. Gotta figure out how to create jobs w/o eroding planetary life support. Tax alone won't do it but will be hard without it.

592 2018-03-13 22:48:39 Well yes, considering head of State Rex Tillerson, also CEO of @exxonmobil got trump to single handily UNDO Obama's ban on offshore drilling. He OPENED EVERY COASTLINE to drilling, therefore directly lining the pockets of Rex and his oil company friends. GO @Schwarzenegger !
593 2018-03-13 22:48:38 Ooh I just bought a new car, now I have something to look forward to with oil changes.
594 2018-03-13 22:48:37 You can always conceal carry....just in case. Pretty sure gun beats rolling pin.
595 2018-03-13 22:48:36 for night stuff, after the ordinary zinc serum, i do a clay mask to rly suck up all that nasty oil and a cotton round.
596 2018-03-13 22:48:23 @CBDHempBenefits My 27 year old daughter started having seizures about a year and half ago. I will be sharing your info with her. I have been using CBD oil for a year in hopes of stopping prescription pain meds and have eliminated all of them. Thanks
597 2018-03-13 22:48:22 Well look how they jus hand down all the oil for Keith nuh. The country doom. 
598 2018-03-13 22:48:16 I say, again, there are exactly ZERO timelines where a man named "Rex Tillerson" doesn't work in oil.
599 2018-03-13 22:48:02 Not sure why that's hypocritical.  Is jet fuel made by the oil companies?

605 2018-03-13 22:47:09 Love that engine oil smell
606 2018-03-13 22:46:48 I think when Exxon pulled out of the big arctic oil deal with Russia last week, he was no longer an asset, so Putin ordered his boy to fire him.
607 2018-03-13 22:46:44 I hear he is going to work on removing all those job killing whale oil and kerosene regulations
608 2018-03-13 22:46:41 What if this was all just an elaborate way to get Pompeo to SoS and more importantly Haspel to CIA. Like, I don't buy that suddenly Tillerson is legitimately concerned about Russia, his buddies who gave him a friendship medal over their shared oil interests.
609 2018-03-13 22:46:36 How does Mobil 1 “guarantee” their 20,000 mile oil? Will they pay for a rebuild if you get sludge build-up? Do you still have to change filters in that time?
610 2018-03-13 22:46:33 Should be arrested.  Disgusting.  Cruelty to animals is a crime.
611 2018-03-13 22:46:25 The greater Vancouver area pumps raw sewage into the Horseshoe Bay but worries about potential oil spill environmental damage - wait WHAT?
612 2018-03-13 22:46:21 We don’t know the answer but I expect it will be yes once Putin switches off our oil. #Fracking #frackfree #FrackOff

619 2018-03-13 22:45:36 I use an oil first, then my normal creme. It works for humidity. 
620 2018-03-13 22:45:36 OH stop crying over spilled milk What is wrong with you people that is the way it works.  Tillerson is a good guy he is just a globalist that is not the direction anymore the people of the USA want to go that voted for DJT.  Oil and water don't mix get it.
621 2018-03-13 22:45:35 Nothing hurts an oil exec more than being told he’s not doing enough to destroy the planet.
622 2018-03-13 22:45:21 Yes please. W olive oil base, chic, mushrooms, jalapeños.
623 2018-03-13 22:44:50 Looks yummy man and yes I guess the round indeed looks ideal for our beef.. how long does it take to get this dark brown colour .. maybe I am going too easy on the oil :)
624 2018-03-13 22:44:44 Hey did you ever verify that it was indeed Obama that lifted the oil embargo and not your Lord and Master Trump? I felt for sure you would have something to say about the SoS being fired the day after he blamed Russia for murdering people on our allies soil, comrades! #copolitics
625 2018-03-13 22:44:37 I don't suck at analogies. This propaganda that anthropogenic climate change is a hoax was started by the oil and gas companies because changing how we utilize energy from those sources would cut into their profit margin.
626 2018-03-13 22:44:30 Putin didn't get his oil deal, so no more need for Rexxon.

635 2018-03-13 22:43:25 So what are Tories going to do about dead Russians and big wads of cash in their coffers? Stop buying gas and oil from Putin or step up arms sales to elements opposed to his allies in the Middle East?

666 2018-03-13 22:40:18 Yeah, when my face is falling off from the Utah dryness (aka every morning), I just walk into my kitchen, get a little dab of coconut oil, and slather it all over my face. Leave it on for a while, then rub it in/wipe off the excess. Unfiltered is what's up!
667 2018-03-13 22:40:15 I'm thinking...even a rich, greedy, American oil oligarch has his limits. I believe Tilly has seen the light & had his come to Jesus moment. He's saying: Enough. I'm out.

673 2018-03-13 22:39:28 With extraction products limited and most extraction-focused LPs focused on commodity infrastructure ergo commodity oil offerings, feels like kicking the can down the road. All vapes and concentrates are not created equal.
674 2018-03-13 22:39:21 I wonder how it would work if you ran an ad telling the voters who the Kochs are, and that they are paying for your opponent.  Gosh, why do rich guys in the oil business not want Tammy?  Very polite but it wouldn't hurt if they got mad.  Make sure you don't.

718 2018-03-13 22:33:45 I was reading an article about the top ten countries that could go bankrupt and vast majority of them were oil dependent nations such as Venezuela.  Good thing our oil industry is only a modest part of our overall economy
719 2018-03-13 22:33:37 Love that my skincare is now 100% handmade. That includes cleansing balm, foam cleanser, scrubs, masks, peels, toner, eye serum, face serum, moisturiser and face oil. Each tailored to my skin as it changes through the month 
My skin has never been better
720 2018-03-13 22:33:29 Piece on the news about Qatar introducing a Sugar Tax.  Will they be banning Seven Seas Oil too? OMD...sorry, G...

722 2018-03-13 22:33:21 hella strawberry shakes and the olive oil will last for a while .
723 2018-03-13 22:33:11 you know it’s bad news when you’re getting your oil changed and the whole jiffy lube squad is looking at your car 
724 2018-03-13 22:33:05 No. But agri-products like oil are commodities   The price is the same anywhere in the world after transportation and tax. The Chinese already place tariffs on our products and go to Brazil or wherever   They are a net buyer. Trump is trying to get tariffs removed on our products
725 2018-03-13 22:33:00 Put peppermint oil on a cotton ball and put where the mouse we're.  It will keep them from coming back and smell amazing..
726 2018-03-13 22:32:53 Filthy oil rich Arab kingdoms and Emirates should do the same with their poor Muslims brothers, unfortunately they use their money to  kill each other when not trying to kill jews.
727 2018-03-13 22:32:49 Rack & pinion is fucked & needs a oil pan gasket bro I just dropped 800 & on clutch & flywheel plus my manifold cracked so I had to get a new one 
728 2018-03-13 22:32:37 Castor oil has done wonders for my lashes.
729 2018-03-13 22:32:36 No and no.. both of them have won league titles with oil money. Neither of them would be able to go to Levy and demand 80 million for a player!!! 
Both would be expected to work with what’s already at the club.
730 2018-03-13 22:32:33 Tillerson is a literal oil tycoon and yet everyone else in this administration is somehow worse
731 2018-03-13 22:32:20 I’m just now seeing this but come get the oil sis
732 2018-03-13 22:32:17 So, without using the oil and gas companies' propaganda, prove your case
733 2018-03-13 22:32:16 Shame cause Arsenal are a top club. Lots of respect for how they went about things. Not run by oil money.
734 2018-03-13 22:32:01 Joyless football @ManUtd will always be oil and water while Jose is in charge. Rather lose trying to win than just losing. Sucking the life out of the club.
735 2018-03-13 22:31:09 I love the people of Arizona, and don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
736 2018-03-13 22:31:08 Alleged. Last year oil dependency in Russia went down, is predicted to go down further next year while agricultural exports grow. The Russian economy is expected to grow slowly and steadily as it has the last two years. I know there are poor in Russia - Putin addresses the issue.
737 2018-03-13 22:31:00 Cut to a tearful Rex Tillerson on a beach pouring a cup of oil on a tiny bird and sniffling "it's not the same" while volunteers with Dawn look on shaking their heads.
738 2018-03-13 22:30:54 I fried chicken for lunch, but the thought of doing something with this oil is giving me angst.

741 2018-03-13 22:30:44 Well Hermione DID partially turn into a cat when she got the wrong hair from Millicent, so I estimate you'd either turn into an Indian or Brazilian woman, or a human shaped puddle of crude oil.
742 2018-03-13 22:30:40 #TYTLive Just logged in. Cenk was right about Tillerson, but this also proves pretty conclusively the Rosnef Oil deal is dead for the foreseeable future. And of course,the GOP will use it as proof there was no collusion, Trump picked Tillerson for SOS bc he's a stable genius.
743 2018-03-13 22:30:39 Absolutely spot on Rev. And note the appalling interviews on STV yesterday. McDonald badgered "are staying on just for the money?". Later ship repairer Woods, now billionaire fawned upon by the other 'McKay. Woods lied to us on oil resources in 2014.

759 2018-03-13 22:27:48 Although I appreciate the thought, I question the word LEADERS.....How are you leading?  Gun control no....Gutting Dodd Frank...yes.

762 2018-03-13 22:27:45 So Putin doesn't like Tillerson any longer. He wasn't able to provide them the Exxon oil deal. Then he dared say he thought Russia was behind the poisoning in UK. So Putin asked his toady skank skunk to fire him. Putin owns our country. BTW he just threatened us.
763 2018-03-13 22:27:33 Going out on a limb here, BUT I’d rather see Pompeo as Secretary of State than an oil tycoon, and Perry as VA hed than handling our nuclear weapons. That’s just me, though!

766 2018-03-13 22:27:02 As I note in my blog post, the alternative is that more tankers (with fewer safety restrictions) will need to sail into the Puget Sound and oil-by-rail will be needed for Puget Sound and Parkland refinery thus putting the Columbia, Fraser and Thompson Rivers at risk
767 2018-03-13 22:26:57 I think Tillerson was a Russian oil kind of guy, and not a Russian piss kind of guy.

771 2018-03-13 22:25:56 If you add BIG oil in to deal you will realize why
772 2018-03-13 22:25:53 After just over a year since his appointment, who knew #RexTillerson, a climate change skeptic and multimillionaire oil tycoon, would end up seeming like a rational and relatively well respected voice of reason.
773 2018-03-13 22:25:45 Ohhh that's good to know! I've been lacing it with heaps of hair oil the last 24 hours, so hopefully that helps a bit! Yeahh I've made some bad hair decisions 
774 2018-03-13 22:25:41 It’s was lovingly referred to as the Mac and the box it came in. The addition was added when oil was struck for the first time in the province. There was an expected boom. It was as mentioned torn down in 1986
775 2018-03-13 22:25:35 We need to vote to help the teachers.  Put back the 7% tax and tax big time on waste water injection wells.  Look at all the damage, earthquakes and playing stupid about what big oil has done.

777 2018-03-13 22:25:27 came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him. The next day he took out two silver coins, and gave them to the inn
778 2018-03-13 22:25:25 Olive oil can go
779 2018-03-13 22:25:21 Tillerson thought it would all be fun and oil deals. He wasn't ready to defend terror attacks on the UK. But he should have known it would come to that.

810 2018-03-13 22:22:48 Putin thought Tillerson was going to facilitate the lifting of sanctions and help create huge Russian oil deals. Tillerson was never there for US but he made a mistake making to many public statements, against putin,  suggesting he was.

830 2018-03-13 22:20:51 Here in Norway the oil industry has acknowledged the climate change, and have in a large degree started to invest in green power and energy, why? Because that's where the money is. Too bad that the same industry in US is doing the complete opposite and going backwards in time.
831 2018-03-13 22:20:42 Yeah I hear ya.  My concern would be he makes the oil super boring to watch. I know he had limited resources but phx was a team like Minnie and any team under Boucher “zzzzzzzzzzzzzz”.  Would be nice to see him in organization though.

842 2018-03-13 22:20:08 So it goes with all industries. U are going to increase cost with ctax. They'll have to make it back somehow. My guess is oil companies figure they are going to pass it on to customer. If u are a primary industry & are captive to world price (ag, forestry, mining) u will eat it

I might have had a little respect for him if he’d added in his little farewell speech that trump is, indeed, a f’ing moron.
854 2018-03-13 22:18:52 Never EVER take your car to @walmart ... even for something as simple as an oil change.
855 2018-03-13 22:18:48 Right after we left from getting her oil changed, Natalie just scraped her tire rim on the curb then instantly looks at me and asks is that something I need to get fixed too??
856 2018-03-13 22:18:35 for my AM moisturizer, i do a clay mask to rly suck up all that nasty oil and a cotton swab.
857 2018-03-13 22:18:32 Oil paint is neat though, it takes longer to dry but once it's dry it's fully cured.
858 2018-03-13 22:18:29 looks like they discovered oil in space
859 2018-03-13 22:18:26 What's even wrong with me, first half I fought an elderly man,now I'm vexing fr everyone
860 2018-03-13 22:18:20 Well when he was nominated he was an Ally of Putin’s with his oil connections, now he was fired because he wanted to be tough on Russia? You’re literally too stupid to insult.
861 2018-03-13 22:18:12 I’ve never been keen on supporting oil companies. If you’re going to spend 500m, make sure you have something to show for it. At least Wenger has an excuse that he doesn’t get that kind of money. Maureen can’t say the same. Soon it will be #MaureenOut.
862 2018-03-13 22:18:00 Finally, we need to understand that electricity is only a fraction of our total energy consumption. Transportation  is almost fully powered by oil. Plus, many industrial processes require coal or natural gas.
863 2018-03-13 22:17:56 CBD oil
864 2018-03-13 22:17:48 I’m now a total oil convert. Face, hair, body, everywhere. Oil. Everywhere.
865 2018-03-13 22:17:44 Lol I’ve never really encountered a Pisces except one lol and we were like oil and water
866 2018-03-13 22:17:39 I love my nappy ass edges idc bout allat gel & extra shit. If water & my wild growth oil don’t keep me down then fuck it 
867 2018-03-13 22:17:35 Nice job today taking it to Zinke.. Now if only we could get him to put as much thought into renewable-energy projects as he has being all cozied up to the Oil industry and the big money interests that own him...
868 2018-03-13 22:17:33 Dip sticks are useful, though! For checking oil or getting out the fun dip from the bottom!
869 2018-03-13 22:17:33 Working on that iron life: roasted salmon with brussel sprouts and quinoa. Soy, sesame oil.
870 2018-03-13 22:17:30 Good morning!

Game day on Thursday at Fil Oil Flyig V Center, 7pm. 

Cocolife Asset Manager vs Petron Blaze Spiker.

Will @UVC_Cocolife can get their 5th win or will @PetronSpikers still the undefeated team, let's find out! May the best team win 
871 2018-03-13 22:17:15 Hmmmm you’ve done nothing on Ukraine or Syria. Probably because the Germans are one of the biggest markets for Russian oil and gas.
872 2018-03-13 22:17:02 I know, right! Thought about bringing in my chain oil for that.
873 2018-03-13 22:17:01 Yeah, I’ve considered applying some oil to that chain!
874 2018-03-13 22:16:48 It depends on sweat, oil, and crap like pollen. I clean mine every couple days.
875 2018-03-13 22:16:33 Could Putin humiliate Trump any further?  People being poisoned by Russian chemicals, Putin building a big arsenal of weapons and showing  them off. Recommending Tillerson thinking they were big oil buddies then saying fire him?
876 2018-03-13 22:16:28 I cheated. Betty Crocker cake mix, then poured in a can of Diet Coke. No oil or eggs, just cake mix and Diet Coke
877 2018-03-13 22:16:20 Why am I getting a teary eye for some middle++ aged white man of oil magnate privileges whom I didn`t know a year ago existed nor had I sympathy towards in any way shape or form?
878 2018-03-13 22:16:09 @Schwarzenegger Oil. 100 million barrels a day X 42 gallons in a  barrel X 365 days = 1.5 trillion gallons total world yearly production. A cubic mile is 1.1 trillion gallons. Compared to forest fires & volcanoes oil is a minor pollutant. It's rhetoric with no facts.
879 2018-03-13 22:16:08 in before ur out of oil
880 2018-03-13 22:16:07 My new fave recipe for a delish, filling and vegan option! Avocado, sliced, kiwi, sliced in same thickness as avocado (to your preference), and mango ( the yellow one), add pink Himalayan sea salt, olive oil, and voila! Ici.
881 2018-03-13 22:16:01 Despite everything Russia is on track. Those of your wishful-thinking ilk will be disappointed. Gold reserves are higher than ever. The oil price has been rising. Innovation has risen as the mother of necessity factor has presented itself. New markets are being found.
882 2018-03-13 22:15:46 How much can I fudge it before I actually get an oil change
883 2018-03-13 22:15:34 Dapat naa cannabis oil pra seg smile si megun hahahahaha
884 2018-03-13 22:15:29 Looking for the outside, is a better view! Corset me if you think I’m wrong, and let’s see if I can counter your opinion. 1) obama was pro big oil. 2) he was pro war! 3) he was pro Wall Street! 4) He cut your medicare by $716Billion &  gave your healthcare to big insurance.
885 2018-03-13 22:15:26 Your numbers are continually changing. You do know Vancouver Island gets it fuel from oil on barges ? Do you agree with Elizabeth May that Bituman should move by rail ? If so you realize the rail lines run on either side of the Fraser River ?
886 2018-03-13 22:15:25 今日から海外出張です
887 2018-03-13 22:15:08 I personally support and like @RepDevinNunes, but seeing as Congress tried to open the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge for oil exploration for decades, Trump got it done in his first year in office, spending 14 months on anything isn't a guarantee..lol
888 2018-03-13 22:15:05 Now I ain't no oil painting but that Post Malone bloke looks like someone covered an Alien Baby in pubic hair.
889 2018-03-13 22:14:54 Ka rena Arsenal kenan
890 2018-03-13 22:14:46 Part of the process. You’ll want to replace all your dinnerware, serving & cooking utensils, etc & eventually become one of those “fancy” peeps w real olive oil on your countertops. 

You might also notice doing dishes becomes a time to meditate. Ain’t so bad!
891 2018-03-13 22:14:33 That’s a lot of benefits from just a bath. Are you a snake oil saleswoman?
892 2018-03-13 22:14:31 The oil change light on my car came on and has presented me a whole new challenge
893 2018-03-13 22:14:30 Two Butterball bath bombs and a tablespoon of eucalyptus bath oil should do the trick for this body of mine... Or at least soothe it enough that I can enjoy my evening.
894 2018-03-13 22:14:30 Fish oil doesn't melt steel beams.
895 2018-03-13 22:14:29 After a few weeks of using beard oil, beard balm and the OX horn beard comb from @badassbeardcare
My beard has become healthier, tangle free, and much more soft.
I highly recommend buying your beard care products from this veteran owned company.
896 2018-03-13 22:14:26 @Schwarzenegger good to hear you are ripping it into the oil companies Arnie. But tobacco companies are the biggest killers. Good Luck big fella from The Timinator
897 2018-03-13 22:14:20 Y’all better get you some Yoni Oil by the goddess body butter 
898 2018-03-13 22:14:09 @realDonaldTrump @EPAScottPruitt  When you allow coal, oil companies & others to defy the clean water act put in place during the Obama administration, you poison American citizens, our wildlife, our water and land.  That makes this administration & the EPA anti-American!
899 2018-03-13 22:14:06 Because we are not fat enough. Fill fried doughnuts with a palm oil spread. That's the ticket. Sigh.
900 2018-03-13 22:14:05 Well they both like oil a lot

904 2018-03-13 22:13:58 Today was parmasaun breaded zucchini squares quick fried in canola oil. :)
905 2018-03-13 22:13:51 It’s probably Ireland’s most listened to daily show. Maybe get local radio stations involved. Go to their website as they’ve signs etc that can be printed out
906 2018-03-13 22:13:50 However so far this is one of the best articles for actual data, numbers, capacities, etc.  And you can't discount that if oil comes in from a pipeline to BC we won't need tankers to bring in the amount we are falling short on.
907 2018-03-13 22:13:19 It's a classic American Dream story; from evil oil exec Russian stooge to troof-telling warrior fighting Hitler...er...Trump. Can't wait to see it on the big screen!
908 2018-03-13 22:13:16 i just wanna draw some stuff for myself but i gotta do my oil painting for class boo
909 2018-03-13 22:13:12 Good luck it’s hard to do a election run when your against a snake oil salesmen and a Crooked president
910 2018-03-13 22:12:58 Our motor oil does not have a shelf life. You're safe to use it!
911 2018-03-13 22:12:50 My guess is that Tillerson still had ExxonMobil's interests at heart.  He spent his entire career with them. If you cut him, he'd bleed Exxon. I was the same.

Oil companies have wanted to get back into Iran since the revolution. Easier to deal with DOS than a new government
912 2018-03-13 22:12:37 They were almost flat broke until Obama eased sanctions. We were winning without war. D-bags
913 2018-03-13 22:12:22 Anyone have some Avon skin so soft bath oil I can buy!? Need it ASAP!
914 2018-03-13 22:12:08 Been having signs of an attack all day and my mother is rubbing ori on my chest, giving me olive oil and holy water to drink and rubbing one Eucharistic healing balm on my nose. 
On top asthma attack 
915 2018-03-13 22:12:08 .@SecretaryPerry who thought that Sec of Energy was a position entailing promotion of US oil & gas interests around the world, probably thinks the department of Veterans Affairs has to do with the love lives of our veterans.  Our service Vets deserve better than Perry.
916 2018-03-13 22:12:05 These two things are not mutually exclusive.  Tillerson was expected to trade the easing of sanctions for lucrative oil contracts.  He failed because everybody found out about it.  Then he spoke ill of Russia and was shown the door.  Occam's razor.

922 2018-03-13 22:11:32 Once again, went to go get an oil change and now we go to the mechanic. I miss the striped blueberry.
923 2018-03-13 22:11:21 (2 of 2)  It may be shell gold (gold ground into a powder), either mixed with a little medium as you describe (usually oil) or alternatively applied over a mordant.

930 2018-03-13 22:10:16 Mourinho and United is like oil and water. They just don't mix. Jose is talking rubbish in his press conference as well. My team never plays to win by default, this can't go on
931 2018-03-13 22:10:15 Loved you on star trek and I agree @justintrudeau is full if lies. But we need those pipelines to be built. Oil is used for so much more than cars. Alberta and Canada need to get our product to market safely. Pipelines are best choice for that. Green will win eventually, not yet.
932 2018-03-13 22:10:08 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
933 2018-03-13 22:09:57 Sure , why the hell not - just kill every living breathing beautiful creature god gave us for ur f’ing oil when we should be looking at clean energy anyway.  #saveourplanet #saveouranimals #protectourwildlife
934 2018-03-13 22:09:51 Baby just got a fresh oil change, vacuumed and washed currently smelling like eucalyptus 
935 2018-03-13 22:09:37 No extra virgin olive oil in Kelvinbridge Coop. Quelle horreur!
936 2018-03-13 22:09:19 Positive vibes/energy/attitude brings about a positive life...how can you expect positivity when you always spewing negativity? It’s not gonna happen.....it’s like trying to mix oil and water
937 2018-03-13 22:09:14 Correct. He is your average Global CEO Oil broker.
938 2018-03-13 22:09:14 @Dominos_UK tweeted on 11th re. Lack of a main topping on my pizza and an already opened/ used oil bottle. Still have had NO response!!!
939 2018-03-13 22:09:08 He's not blaming anyone. Just pointing out a fact. If one person doesn't pay enough someone else must pick up slack.
940 2018-03-13 22:09:04 Fried it’s fine Andrew dry fry it though don’t use oil I wouldn’t let me know 
941 2018-03-13 22:09:00 Trump annoyed the oil and gas sector with his tariffs on pipeline-grade steel. They may get ornery if he rotates industry friend @SecretaryPerry out of DOE.
942 2018-03-13 22:09:00 Banana oil.
943 2018-03-13 22:08:57 @keenanhonda_pa 

I leased a car from you guys in late december.  Oil changes free at all?  At least first one?
944 2018-03-13 22:08:46 What does this smell like ? “It smell like oil , go wash your hands “ 
945 2018-03-13 22:08:36 RT mygrowspotsa: RT Aurora_MMJ "cbdlover Hi there, we released a new batch of CBD oil yesterday!"
946 2018-03-13 22:08:28 Some are fed up with being led to war, with the use of lies, to protect the Petrodollar and the Western Oil industry.
947 2018-03-13 22:07:58 Especially that one guy who came and had an hour long conversation with you while you changed your oil 
948 2018-03-13 22:07:50 musialam wstac z cieplego łóżka po tea tree oil bo wyczułam wulkan na mordzie
949 2018-03-13 22:07:45 If the replacement of Tillerson has anything to do with Iran and there will be sanctions in the future, if targeting oil there would be a lot of supply taken out of the market >higher prices (demand filled by US shale and Saudis)
950 2018-03-13 22:07:44 We're also spending a lot of money underground, on mines, and oil wells and such. We should have something down there, like the air force, but underground. A ground force.
951 2018-03-13 22:07:42 Ok so they wanted Eritrea to be just obedient back then ,however what about something like oil,uranium resources which were of economical value?..
952 2018-03-13 22:07:22 Forced by who exactly? What is the enforcement procedure against the USA by some foreign court? This money was confiscated and should have remained property of the US government. Letting Iran sell oil legally would be gift enough.
953 2018-03-13 22:07:13 Mourinho clearly is not a progressive coach. Match u for win , u start Fellaini. He and Matic were almost like for like. No wonder our midfield axis felt like an oil rig movement; slow and painful. Mourinho is done for. Drawing 0-0 at anfield earlier cost us and now this
954 2018-03-13 22:07:11 Except the argument we are addressing is the transportation of oil via a pipeline and while we plan for a just transition we have to recognize that we need to transport fuels in the safest manner possible. This has become more important as the Puget Sound changes its supply mix
955 2018-03-13 22:07:01 Did you know oil mist is what is created when machines work at moderate speed & with moderate coolant pressure? Size of particle is similar to PM2.5. #AirPollution #indoorairquality #BreatheLife

960 2018-03-13 22:06:44 In fact Venezuela nationalized the oil fields from BP, and the government ran them.  That's what socialists do Charlie Brown.

963 2018-03-13 22:06:02 Wow my dad took my car to get a car wash, oil change, & filled my tank while i was outta town 
964 2018-03-13 22:06:00 Really?? Tillerson was a Putin stooge, lest you forget his friendship medal presented BY PUTIN HIMSELF!!! He was appointed SOS to get the sanctions relief/oil money for Putin. Also decimated State Dept. You can’t be that naive Anna!?!?!??!!
965 2018-03-13 22:05:56 Fuck you @chevrolet you guys picked the worst spot to place an oil filter in a Tahoe fuck you
966 2018-03-13 22:05:47 Get this Tillerson knows Oil
If we get sanction on Russia
Big oil like exxox lose billions
He wants to live in his old neighborhood 
Trump didn't take oil money
967 2018-03-13 22:05:46 Came to the car place for a nice simple oil change. 2 hours and over $1000 later and im still here. Today is not going as planned.
968 2018-03-13 22:05:37 Using water when just 2ft away is the perfect tool for putting out an oil fire! You have a Fire Blanket!!

973 2018-03-13 22:04:35 Robert needs to stop throwing a fit every time we have to change the car's oil.  He is ridiculous

977 2018-03-13 22:03:54 Yeah right, then explain why Trump is deregulating the gas and oil, opening up ANWR, Putin's lifeblood is energy. Why DT is increasing military spending, upgrading nukes, Putin told him to? Today, Rex out, Pomp in, Putin not happy. Would Putin want a roaring US economy? Its BS

979 2018-03-13 22:03:29 Class action suit could be a viable affair. Big Oil has known for at least 60 yrs about CO2's contribution to #GreenhouseEffect & what it would ultimately lead to, water levels & all. Not to mention all the disease caused by pollution. Could hasten the switch to #Renewables 
980 2018-03-13 22:03:17 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
981 2018-03-13 22:03:13 You know trump liked Tillerson because he was buddies with Russia and an oil guy.  Perfect for bomhing Iraq and taking the oil.  Glad that didn’t happen.  I don’t know much about Pompeo.  Back when he was named CIA director I knew there was a stink about it.
982 2018-03-13 22:03:10 Trump has been trying to fool the American people since the beginning of the campaign. He is making life easy for the big corporations to make huge profits from land which should remain untouched. He's a failed snake oil salesman, but a dangerous one.
983 2018-03-13 22:03:09 Go fly over the minors in the oil companies that are destroying our mother nature those are the real criminals

991 2018-03-13 22:02:42 Over the last 70 years UK annual GDP Growth average is 2.55% per year.

2.55% pa through 7 recessions, Suez crisis, Oil crisis, Global banking crisis, Multiple foreign interventions, Cold war, Wall street crashes.

Today the Tories cheered for predicted growth of 1.30%. Pathetic.
992 2018-03-13 22:02:39 Now don't be giving them too much info Mr. Fox.  Next he'll have boiling cauldrons of oil stationed at strategic spots along the wall. 
993 2018-03-13 22:02:39 Small banter you don dey vex 
994 2018-03-13 22:02:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
995 2018-03-13 22:02:28 May I suggest investing in hard hats for future use?

998 2018-03-13 22:02:20 Kim Jong Un is going to eat trumps lunch. 
I never ever thought I would be rooting for an oil company executive to win at anything...
So Putin had Tillerson fired? Is he next on the poisoning list?
999 2018-03-13 22:02:17 I have bottles of gas and camping stoves, and paraffin and stove an oil lamps 
Need a gas powered fridge-freezer.
1000 2018-03-13 22:02:08 He is bored with nuclear power plants and stockpiles. Not very macho. He thought he would be managing oil and gas. Oops 
1001 2018-03-13 22:02:02 we’re essential oil fans first and people second
1002 2018-03-13 22:01:51 I had it up too high and the oil spat at me mate I look not okay I have three red circles on my face and one on my neck it's like the start of chicken pox

1004 2018-03-13 22:01:42 What I told you

 that after all these trade negotiations are completed agricultural exports forestry exports coal exports and oil exports increase.

Will you still be pissed off?
1005 2018-03-13 22:01:39 Had a lady scream at me at work today bc she thought I didn’t give her all of her fish oil pills 3 months ago. Cause, Yano, I just love hoarding fish oil.

I'm  not a fan of Mourniho n i never  will be.

I'm  a footballer by nature  mourinho is the opposite.

Manzi ne oil
1009 2018-03-13 22:01:18 That my point. I don’t think the oil execs will be swayed by this decision.  I know some of the blue collar pipe guys and they don’t care about any of this. Not moving the needle for them.

1013 2018-03-13 22:01:09 and my friends boyfriend is a mechanic and he’s going to change my oil for me, i only had to buy oil and an oil filter. saved me $50. beyond blessed
1014 2018-03-13 22:01:08 Wrong! He dropped bombs to control resources! He destroyed Libya because they started trading THEIR oil in the African dinar and stop using the US dollar. Obama was owned by Wall Street. Obama bombed civilian centers,
1015 2018-03-13 22:01:01 Is their any regulation on these snake oil salesman with their unscientific bullshit  #rtept
1016 2018-03-13 22:01:00 For example, Norway with high % temporary income (oil revenues) cannot consume like their GDP might naively suggest.  AHDI or AIC provide more realistic signal of their projected permanent income.
1017 2018-03-13 22:00:58 Chicago trying to gave a River Walk like San Antione. Never! It is ugly with a wide canal full of rats, oil, garbage from companies in the river. It is not beautiful like Texas. The restaurants are so expensive along the Chicago River and too many foreign. Gangbangers roam it.
1018 2018-03-13 22:00:54 So I'm sure all the idiots that don't want pipelines will go & turn off there oil/gas supply & ride bikes to work etc
1019 2018-03-13 22:00:38 #TimeToWakeUp Republican party used to be on board till it became more profitable after the 1960's to manipulate the public & become "Merchants of Doubt." They took a lesson from tobacco industry think tank deniability to use for denying man-made global warming, for oil profits.
1020 2018-03-13 22:00:35 I wouldn't. She's already called me plenty of names before those. 
1021 2018-03-13 22:00:32 Firing an oil and gas icon the way he did results in some kind of death. I imagine they will tear his empire apart

1027 2018-03-13 22:00:00 Thank you Rex! You stood up for the values that honors the US and the world instead of the depressing Trump version of the world - as a former petrol/oil mogul - you redeemed yourself! #thanksrex #rexit @rexit #goodbyetrump #exittrump #trumpen #ireallymissobama @obamarules
1028 2018-03-13 22:00:00 Ummm... is that your wife standing behind you with a rolling pin?
1029 2018-03-13 21:59:57 Yes, every coconut exported from a pacific island reduces the amount of biomass. Combined, this makes for hundreds of tons taken away from the island every year. The sea level isn't rising, it's hippies with their coconut yoghurt, coconut oil and coconut water shrinking them
1030 2018-03-13 21:59:52 I've decided to take my car to a shop staffed & run by the local & state govt, with fed govt mandates. It's $400 for an oil change, and their service really sucks.

Thoughts?
1031 2018-03-13 21:59:27 Whats sad is people still flock to hearing her speak and are eager to be defrauded hundreds of thousands $.
1032 2018-03-13 21:59:19 Agbhhh take ur oil...lol.
1033 2018-03-13 21:59:11 No, darlin', the oil can stay on top, Hillary, not so much.
1034 2018-03-13 21:58:52 I use a healthy amount of olive oil. I'm going to see if I can get a better spatula that will slip under the egg easier.
1035 2018-03-13 21:58:47 A new development in the 2015 English Bay oil spill trial: PPSC tells me "The trial against Alassia is no longer being heard at this time.  The charges against Alassia remain outstanding and a trial may occur at a future date." Details at @CKNW
1036 2018-03-13 21:58:36 I was thinking he was a business man in it for the oil. Treason may have been a bridge too far. Plus, he didn't want to work anymore. He just wanted to be a retired old man and golf all day, like Trump
1037 2018-03-13 21:58:34 I had to Google “marula oil.” Thankfully, I’m not tempted/convinced I need it. Ha ha!
1038 2018-03-13 21:58:19 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
1039 2018-03-13 21:58:13 Is this cretin intellectually challenged? I know 4 year old children who communicate far more effectively. This president always sounds like a shyster snake oil salesman. Or a Crap reality show host.

1043 2018-03-13 21:57:56 @raegy_ Hear you there! Did you end up getting that oil changed yet?
1044 2018-03-13 21:57:56 Enjoy their well laundered oil & slave money as they will. I won't be watching.
1045 2018-03-13 21:57:55 Me: Eating 1700 calories.
Trainer: Eat 2600

I have never seen so many wildly different responses, when I requested snack options from the internet mind on FB.

That's too much. That's too little. Dont eat carbs. Eat bread. Fats are bad. Add oil to your diet.

Food is hard.
1046 2018-03-13 21:57:32 Republicans are afraid of anything that is capable of taking down big oil.
1047 2018-03-13 21:57:23 Eyah sorry my dear. I can feel ur pains. He should have used palm oil instead. Vry smooth!
1048 2018-03-13 21:57:21 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
1049 2018-03-13 21:57:20 Iran has a $393B (US) GDP. 47%  is services, 23% oil, 13% mfg, 10% agro, 7% utilities. GDP has been falling and military spending increasing. There’s a reason they’re having domestics demonstrations. It’s not just about wearing hajibs. I’d lean cautious.
1050 2018-03-13 21:57:15 It’s bullshite.  The democrats are still taking money from big oil.  This is more lip service

1056 2018-03-13 21:56:19 I hope this avocado oil is the truth.

1060 2018-03-13 21:56:02 I think he was there to get a handle on the global oil strategy. Now that he has a handle on that Pompeo is better suited to drive a strategy is filled with more intrigue. As long as he keeps getting results he can plug an play as he wishes.
1061 2018-03-13 21:55:59 So no tanker spills, got it. Why the problem with tankers then? Many more instances of train related oil spills vs. mixed modern tankers
1062 2018-03-13 21:55:57 Not sure legitimising Big Oil funded Vivian Krause and her personal crusade is a good way to achieve an unbiased , fair piece about the pipeline and those who oppose it ( leaving out a Lot of more important community leaders in the process)
1063 2018-03-13 21:55:41 I've ran out of butter so I just had to have extra virgin olive oil on my bread. This is what real poverty is all about.
1064 2018-03-13 21:55:37 Before the tax cut the oil industry calculus was clear - exchange carbon tax for a lower corporate rate. Any level of carbon tax acceptable to the overall economy was already proven to not affect demand very much. Oil demand goes down a little, taxes down a lot. Now?
1065 2018-03-13 21:55:33 Fork oil really gets everywhere...
1066 2018-03-13 21:55:32 Thx @swevers89, @JohnCarnegie7 @GreenpeaceNZ, re your Q: NZ produces 35% of its oil needs, the rest is imported. That affirms my point that it's a global market, so if we don't produce here, it will be produced overseas and imported. So do it here and get the economic benefits!
1067 2018-03-13 21:55:32 Peak rush hour is not the time to carry around an oil painting of ya own face down oxford street. I looked like a right ballsack.
1068 2018-03-13 21:55:26 Once you've blended the favas, flour, herbs, oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and lemon juice in the food processor, add that to the bowl with the potatoes and mix really well. Then chill. You don't HAVE to chill first but it makes forming the balls easier.
1069 2018-03-13 21:55:22 America is going to be really sorry when those dodgy US wells go dry.  They won't be able to buy oil at any price that doesn't involve invading Mexico or Canada.
1070 2018-03-13 21:55:13 $20 on oil country tonight wanna see both teams go down
1071 2018-03-13 21:54:55 @realDonaldTrump If this is true, PLEASE replace Rick Perry with someone who understands nuclear energy. All he knows about is oil, which helps NO ONE working on the Hanford Nuclear Reservation with vapors sickening our workers. Our DOE deserves better & smarter!!
1072 2018-03-13 21:54:54 I want a huge oil painting of this with us in period garb.
1073 2018-03-13 21:54:53 Why didn’t you change her oil
1074 2018-03-13 21:54:51 Quite true Russia US etc are spending billions on new explorations of oil and cannot wait until Arctic melts - so that they drill baby drill - even though that will seal the fate of all life on Earth
1075 2018-03-13 21:54:50 @RomeluLukaku9 oil lukaku u lazy get. You used to bully defenders. Now your nothing but a lazy overpaid coward. Start performing or go and sign for a team on your level. Yeovil.

1081 2018-03-13 21:54:27 .@SenWarren sums up why it's #TimeToWakeUp: "The American people deserve leadership that doesn't work for Big Oil. The American people deserve leadership that works for them."
1082 2018-03-13 21:54:26 You think Blair King is unbiased? He’s an oil industry shill. You might as well listen to the Texan Kinder Morgan CEO for your “unbiased” information.

1084 2018-03-13 21:54:11 Lemon water bowl was around long before moist towelettes. It's still used in some places as tradition, or because it simply lasts a lot longer than a moist towelette, and is all natural. The acids in the lemon juice weaken the oil's bonds to your skin and make it easy to remove.

1088 2018-03-13 21:53:22 No oil will be leaving by tanker through those straits if that starts, Argentina has been alienated I guess we still have the UK &Mexico .  Oh wait
1089 2018-03-13 21:53:08 I might as well change my oil since I'm free for a couple of hours
1090 2018-03-13 21:53:05 Tillerson/Exxon in bed with Putin. Trump is an unknowing or knowing puppet but thinks he's so smart (cuz he's dumb). Rex got tired of it. Told Putin I'll call you out, Trump will fire me, let's get back to business -pumping oil. Pompeo is just another tool.
1091 2018-03-13 21:52:45 @EIAgov: "Venezuela’s crude oil production will continue to fall through at least the end of 2019"

1095 2018-03-13 21:52:36 I am looking at oil on troubled waters, cloak of invisibility, and dream time. I had to read ingredients cause I am highly allergic to citrus

1097 2018-03-13 21:52:14 well yes..like the oil spill in the gulf. Exxon's ceo bought halliburton two months before the spill happened. So, they stood to benefit from its cleanup. Fucked
1098 2018-03-13 21:52:04 @jimcramer what you think of marathon oil stock?
1099 2018-03-13 21:52:01 I used to think that the people who run Big Oil love profit above all else. But now it seems that their desire for death--of our planet, and everyone on it--tops everything.
1100 2018-03-13 21:51:57 Mourinho's second season syndrome fucked up well and truly by a bald fraud and oil cunts. #mcfc
1101 2018-03-13 21:51:56 I don’t believe it. The Venezuelan current debt is backed by oil and also the petro is. As the new stated, the petro is other way to the Venezuelan government to acquire more debt.

1111 2018-03-13 21:50:56 somebody needs to tell Schwarzenegger that suing oil companies for 1st degree murder, isn't how 1st degree murder works. It must be willful & premeditated, & there has to be intent on the part of the accused. In Arnold's defense though, the big oil companies can be huge dickwads.
1112 2018-03-13 21:50:48 Used CBD oil and have some. I really have to be careful with money right now until next month.

1114 2018-03-13 21:50:40 Bahahaha wow. Seriously man because we are so hooked on oil we don’t even have a viable alternative yet. Electric cars are a joke and who can even afford to repair it. A battery pack on a Prius is 5000 and you have to use new. Worked for Toyota for 10 yrs

1117 2018-03-13 21:50:22 Poor economics sorry. 1. The economy is not a zero-sum game, investment in oil CREATES wealth (most productive sector in NZ) which can be invested in other things inc. renewables. 2. The investor is best placed to judge opportunity cost (also the ETS internalises the CC effects).
1118 2018-03-13 21:50:04 What's interesting is there wasn't much discussion of the greenhouse gases these steel & aluminium plants produce during Trudeaus tour. Mention oil pipelines & that's all people want to talk about. Double standard? #canpoli

1124 2018-03-13 21:49:32 @EdmProspects you should offer discount tickets for special events to elementary schools. Last week my husband and our son went with a group from school to see an Oil Kings game. The school sent home a note offering group tickets. It was fun for them to go as a community group.
1125 2018-03-13 21:49:16 Oh no. Not more oil. So bad for our economy. 
1126 2018-03-13 21:49:12 driverless cars first plse.  Even cars dont depend on oil even better!!!  If we N Z an experiment welcome!
1127 2018-03-13 21:49:07 Well, when you've mown the lawn, you need to clean the mower, then oil the mower, then clean the yard of mower cleanings by which time the grass has grown again.... ;)

1129 2018-03-13 21:49:01 Y’all need to oil the Piano. Seems rusty 
1130 2018-03-13 21:48:49 The payment they get is from an Oil Wealth Trust Fund. It's not funded by taxes collected. It's a corporate funded bribe/payoff! Not exactly Unconditional Basic Income.
1131 2018-03-13 21:48:49 Government announces details of $1.5-billion plan to protect the coast"Only if the KINDER OIL deal Happens...First Nation expects a big junk of this money....Who is going to "constantly"watch where and who is receiving this money
1132 2018-03-13 21:48:42 He hasn't done any harm there because he doesn't know what they do. He literally thought it was oil production, and didn't know it was about nukes and safeguarding them.
1133 2018-03-13 21:48:29 Kamala Harris, Rex Tillersons leaving, your Tuesday opportunity to get that sour face up in the camera lense. There is no term oil in the White-House,STOP your wishful thinking leftie!
1134 2018-03-13 21:48:29 Beware of Pacific and Vine garage.
They replaced a starter on my truck, 3 weeks later I hear a loud noise while starting the vehicle. Following oil leaking. Took the vehicle to the same shop. And I found out the starter come loose. It hit a couple of lines and destroyed my truck

1139 2018-03-13 21:48:10 Plus under Obama US built 1000's of miles of pipelines, more than doubled exports of oil to eastern Canada- no wonder they fund anti pipeline nutters in Canada & blocked energy east - smart business for them, spineless gov for us that allows this
1140 2018-03-13 21:47:57 Yeah, oil tycoon and water filled balloon

1144 2018-03-13 21:47:36 How about the oil industry? Your gov't sure likes the tax revenue from it.
1145 2018-03-13 21:47:30 Find it ironic how @RachelNotley's cover photo on Twitter is her with her kids and yet she pushes the oil pipeline. I tweet this as someone in my 30's... if you truly cared about younger generations you would try to act more responsibly. I'm sure you've got good intentions and--
1146 2018-03-13 21:47:28 He is very fluffy -  his fringe / fur on his nose is still long. I'm deffo going to start washing my hair in neem oil lol - guess he is quite a light look to him hog. He maybe fluffy but he isn't fluffy by nature unless you've got him dinner

1149 2018-03-13 21:47:12 Any cryptocurrency should be decentralized, but in this case The Petro is backed by the government and oil. In most of the cases, cryptocurrencies get their value by the use people give to them, but in this case, the petro has its value due to the value of oil.
1150 2018-03-13 21:47:00 We found oil on the moon!!!
1151 2018-03-13 21:46:49 YES I reckon the best ones don't blot off with much colour, maybe? But my god, how much make up repair stuff am I supposed to carry around with me?! Stupid oil

1153 2018-03-13 21:46:43 1/ Some context. Rex Tillerson was a recipient of Russia’s Order of Friendship after signing deals with the state-owned Russian oil company Rosneft, whose chief, Igor Sechin, is seen as Putin's loyal lieutenant. So, it’s reasonable to be queasy about that.

1157 2018-03-13 21:45:43 Whaaaaaa—
1158 2018-03-13 21:45:41 If Trump's looking for a new energy secretary, I hear Rex Tillerson's available, and has a lot of background in the oil business.
1159 2018-03-13 21:45:41 And “feminist” Trudeau prefers we buy oil from them instead of using Canadian oil.
1160 2018-03-13 21:45:32 try turpentine or paint thinner, it’s meant to dissolve oil paints so it should help a little and maybe go back in and scrub with some bleach
1161 2018-03-13 21:45:30 Post this on the @POTUS page; quit using your personal account to publish #government information. 

So the oil guy got a tax cut he wanted and regulations on ocean oil drilling relaxed and now is quitting.

You are the #worst thing that ever happened to #America.

1167 2018-03-13 21:45:02 "When the CBOE Volatility Index goes up -- because the U.S. stock market becomes more volatile -- no asset class goes up with it; stocks and bonds and gold and oil all fall as stock-market volatility rises"

1174 2018-03-13 21:43:50 The only reason Tillerson was appointed was the largest oil deal in world history. Now that the EXXON deal is off, Rex serves no purpose.
1175 2018-03-13 21:43:50 Yes we are already locked into a terrible future but the worst possible future could still be avoided if green energy was given the support it needs and fossil fuels is kept in the ground - logical but Big Oil are determined to keep on spewing their lethal cargo

1178 2018-03-13 21:43:18 Great work Neil. 

Presumably your modeller can't easily model inflation shocks (oil prices / Brexit shock / 24% CPI in 1970s / black swans). How do you model the 2.5% cap on revaluations?

1184 2018-03-13 21:42:50 I saw this coming when Exxon canceled it's bid to get 500 billion dollars of oil from Russia. Rex was no longer needed to be the one to approve it. it's all about the money.

1187 2018-03-13 21:42:40 Albertans believe there is a big red button in the Legislature building labeled "turn off the oil" and that Rachel Notley pushed it

1191 2018-03-13 21:42:22 If it says 20% renewable then 80% is oil based plastic which never ‘degrades’

1197 2018-03-13 21:42:06 Several economists have pointed out it was impossible for UK to go bankrupt, that’s why BOE exists...all that QE money, 450 billion, you wasted to prop up yr wet dream of austerity..like Thatcher used NS Oil to prop her up in 80’s
1198 2018-03-13 21:42:05 Well, all I have heard so far are these wild promises that I would be staggered to see implemented. When do we get honest politicians with sound plans that detail their plans to improve  the province rather than snake oil vendors?
1199 2018-03-13 21:42:05 It’s a natural anti-bacterial and anti-fungal oil! It will make ur pimps go away and is prob 100x better than putting rubbing alcohol on your skin. U can buy at Whole Foods, Amazon, etc!
1200 2018-03-13 21:41:55 That must have been an embarrassing sight. *covers her eyes with her organic hand and shakes her head, the biometal one stays on his chest* Oh no, that was some really cheap oil in there. Stuff like that can damage your engine... Never again.

1202 2018-03-13 21:41:52 Arnold Schwarzenegger, what's up with him? I once thought he was quite intelligent, but this thing about oil companies killing us same as tobacco is the dumbest rant I have seen yet. Civilization would be very sad shape if it weren't for oil. God provided for us. We move on..

1206 2018-03-13 21:41:12 I am extremely skeptical of essential oils and “natural” products but I just used a new yoga mat cleaner from the fancy essential oil store and it smells so good I feel like my life might be perfect now???

1219 2018-03-13 21:40:07 I love sipping bone broth instead of eating breakfast.  When keto, I mix in a couple spoonfuls of MCT oil or avocado oil with an immersion blender.
1220 2018-03-13 21:39:57 I don't think anyone's even told him that DoE has nothing to do with oil, so. . .
1221 2018-03-13 21:39:52 Remember that time you based a whole white paper on running a country based on high oil out-put @ $114 per barrel and a year later the oil price dropped to $25 a barrel.... you were wrong then, what makes us think you would be right now!!!!

1223 2018-03-13 21:39:32 My Italian MIL's answer to everything is olive oil. For real.
1224 2018-03-13 21:39:21 Do you eat meat ? Fish ? Chicken ? 

I like a vinaigrette that has spent 24 hours in the fridge marinating. My mum's recipe : olive oil (or any of your choice) + lemon juice+ sugar/honey + salt + onion of your choice in tiny bits. I add a little mustard and mayo sometimes.

1235 2018-03-13 21:38:33 Anyways, 1 bottle of that hair oil lasted me for about 5 months. I oil my scalp twice a week, set my hair every night & use mango butter & aloe vera juice to moisturize.
1236 2018-03-13 21:38:13 I need something with a lot of coverage but not too thick or my  texture looks awful, but I also have very oily skin so I need something that doesn't break down or fade from oil AND IT'S SO HARD TO FIND SOMETHING THAT DOES ALL OF THAT but also doesn't break me out more

1269 2018-03-13 21:34:59 I loved the olive oil fried egg sandwich from Il Cane Rosso, but the good news is it that I think it's available at @lkiino's @RedDogSOMA.
1270 2018-03-13 21:34:52 I came for the oil, but all I got was this boil.

1271 2018-03-13 21:34:51 At least he’ll have fewer (big oil) conflicts of interest at the VAO than in the Dept of Energy. That’s how low the bar is.
1272 2018-03-13 21:34:48 まじや
1273 2018-03-13 21:34:47 Better spent on CBD OIL!!!!
1274 2018-03-13 21:34:45 Justin Trudeau, Texas, March 2017: "I make no bones about it. We’re very proud of this. It’s progress. It’s important. As I said on the very first trip to the oil patch back in 2012, no country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground & just leave them there." #cdnpoli
1275 2018-03-13 21:34:39 and oil prices went up and political tensions flared as a consequence of devalution, inflation, strikes... I'm not sure things were so easy, all in all.
1276 2018-03-13 21:34:36 Rustproof Massage Oil
1277 2018-03-13 21:34:29 I never was a fan of Tillerson. Didn't make a lot of sense to put a big oil guy in charge of the State. This is a good change.
1278 2018-03-13 21:34:16 heard an interesting steel bear case today. Putting workers back into inefficient mills..ramping production..negative for prices. Kinda like oil.
1279 2018-03-13 21:34:12 Dropped my car off at the shop before work for an oil change, said I work all day, dude said he'd leave the keys in the car for me after they close. Walk all the way there just for the keys to be nowhere in the car. 

Pissed is a motherfucking understatement right now.
1280 2018-03-13 21:34:06 coconut oil makes me feel boujee
1281 2018-03-13 21:33:57 I need to check on my guys...their engine oil gauge is low 
1282 2018-03-13 21:33:33 Oh no! Please don’t take the wholly unqualified & ladened-with-big-oil-conflicts-of-interest guy away from the Dept of @ENERGY ! And what will become of the @DeptVetAffairs if the inept, paranoid guy gets removed?! Everything’s been going so well with up til now!

1285 2018-03-13 21:33:28 The wiccy magic massage bar has changed the pregnancy game, girl. Cocoa butter for stretch mark prevention and the oil blend eases the aches and pains of stretching ligaments! I reapply twice a day and it’s made a world of difference.
1286 2018-03-13 21:33:26 I can't believe I'm thinking this but...but I wish the oil guy was still at State.
1287 2018-03-13 21:33:25 More like swamp water and big oil.
1288 2018-03-13 21:33:13 Sevilla ruining foitball with Oil money... man Utd need to give Jose more money to spend so he can compete with Arab money clubs like Sevilla
1289 2018-03-13 21:33:06 Oh really is that why he drives a HumV seems oil hasn't been boycotted by Arnold
1290 2018-03-13 21:32:53 EWWWW lmfao i don't like #OrganicPeanutButter doe "there's water in the peanut butter" lmfaooo naw it's oil! "let's get coconut water cuz it makes your boobs and your butt grow" ummm what? LMFAOOO #DontBeTardy
1291 2018-03-13 21:32:53 EZ shares -0.9%, US shares -0.6% (were +0.7% after benign CPI, but Tillerson going prob didn’t help as seen adding to staff instability and reducing support for mkt friendly policies). US 10 yr yld -3bp to 2.84%. Oil -0.8%, gold +0.2%, iron ore +0.2%. ASX futures -0.6%. $A 0.786
1292 2018-03-13 21:32:52 Oil for the hair and skin
1293 2018-03-13 21:32:38 Media :Tillerson a 1%, oil man, for big business only,destroys the environment......after fired by President Trump : Tillerson was a pillar in the Trump administration , a decent man,you could talk to him and reason with him.......Media is so disingenuous
1294 2018-03-13 21:32:37 Oil money has apparently suppressed the free energy UFO saucer of Nikola  Tesla brought by 1945 Nazi in Operation Paperclip to America while  Russia stumbled on the factories and workers must have Putin in command   who must suppress for his own oil money. Casual flights allowed.
1295 2018-03-13 21:32:26 Your future wife probably has Coconut oil in her hair with no man raising her blood pressure. Don't stress kings , she out there
1296 2018-03-13 21:32:20 pray tell what essential oil blend will write my thesis proposal for me
1297 2018-03-13 21:32:08 Neither was Obama or most appointees/advisors. #hillaryclinton
1298 2018-03-13 21:32:07 Some context. Rex Tillerson was a recipient of Russia’s Order of Friendship after signing deals with the state-owned Russian oil company Rosneft, whose chief, Igor Sechin, is seen as Putin's loyal lieutenant. So, it’s reasonable to be queasy about that.
1299 2018-03-13 21:32:04 There isn’t many feelings that are better than an oil change, full tank of gas, and a car wash! #ItsTheLittleThings
1300 2018-03-13 21:32:01 Getting oil changes and car washes make me feel like such a responsible adult 
1301 2018-03-13 21:31:51 CBC did a terrible job reporting on it as well. Did you know their board of directors has connections to suncor and amcor? Oil and pipes. Just did quick google search on a couple, likely more. Disappointing. Hard to keep up with the corruption.
1302 2018-03-13 21:31:38 Some hard medicine for Texas Oil.  Ouch, America  Think about it  #AmericanReconcilliation #Resist
1303 2018-03-13 21:31:37 The oil behind it may or may not be real . . .  and may be on a boat or not . . . risk on!
1304 2018-03-13 21:31:33 I only get my oil changed on Ladies Day so I can get that discount 
1305 2018-03-13 21:31:26 “I’ll lift your whole hood like you got oil under it”
1306 2018-03-13 21:31:23 Fun fun shit I think I’m about to go to the oil field to find a better job
1307 2018-03-13 21:31:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet the purpose of keeping out criminals.
1308 2018-03-13 21:31:03 Oil money has apparently suppressed the free energy UFO saucer of Nikola Tesla brought by 1945 Nazi in Operation Paperclip to America while   Russia stumbled on the factories and workers must have Putin in command   who must suppress for his own oil money.

1309 2018-03-13 21:30:58 Awwwww shit. No doubt. And then to have honestly and properly divested oneself.  He may have been a dirty oil tycoon but ....
1310 2018-03-13 21:30:50 Ask those on the NE coast of the US, ask the city of Houston if they think AGW is beneficial. Ask the vignerons having different varieties ripen closer together every year and they have to plant more heat resistant varieties like Fiano. Pruitt is an idiot and oil shill.
1311 2018-03-13 21:30:47 actually, more the question is why the democraps that hated this choice are now blue in the face over the oil can man??? Trump gets rid of the grief they gave him, now they are still whining????
1312 2018-03-13 21:30:40 OIL DIFF: 3.88 -> 3.98
1313 2018-03-13 21:30:23 Love waiting 2 hours for an oil change that I could have done myself in probably 30 minutes
1314 2018-03-13 21:30:19 the which girlscout cookie is better discourse is irrelevant to me now bc im pretty sure they all have palm oil

that being said im really sad bc i wanna eat all of them

1317 2018-03-13 21:30:05 Every car, regardless of the make and model, will need to have their oil changed -not only to ensure the mechanics of the car, but also to prevent a void in your vehicle's warranty. Modern lubricants will need to be applied every 5,000 miles; 15,000 miles for full synthetic oil.
1318 2018-03-13 21:30:02 They seated me under the kitchen exhaust vent at Pies n Thighs, sorry, I'll smell like hot peanut oil until I die

1320 2018-03-13 21:29:38 Movie directors don’t tell us every time a movie is fake including horror films. You make that assumption yourself. Adam is an entertainer. He didn’t sell you any snake oil, just entertainment.
1321 2018-03-13 21:29:33 But we are looking at an 11 billion deficit this year, with oil at historical norms?  Why?  NDP has incurred so much structural deficit due to programs and public servants, which is a terrible thing to spend borrowed money on.

1325 2018-03-13 21:29:19 No oil money, just gas money.

1327 2018-03-13 21:29:14 I’m not a huge lemon pepper fan myself, but fresh ingredients are good! I’d add olive oil too. My best attempts at chicken breasts have come from using oil and acid.
1328 2018-03-13 21:28:52 He clearly has not been using my magic oil
1329 2018-03-13 21:28:42 How many babies does it take to make one bottle of baby oil?

Makes the best of choice today @CyberdomeN because its better safe than sorry.
1333 2018-03-13 21:28:20 I know that. I'm saying historically, not just 2014 forward. Look back to the 1980s, oil has NEVER been this high, and never needed to be. I could totally understand a deficit in 2015 when it dropped to $27, maybe even a smaller deficit in 2016.
1334 2018-03-13 21:28:09 Why do you think mbs has been stockpiling weapons and stolen billions, Tillerson knows war will destroy the oil and gas industry too and that's exon profits blown. Trump was blinded by Saudi flattery and money and is a kitten in a lions den. I'm not hopefull 
1335 2018-03-13 21:27:56 Do you know when the next oil change should be?
1336 2018-03-13 21:27:34 Finally got your oil changed rejoice
1337 2018-03-13 21:27:30 I think I used too much olive oil and not enough vinegar on my salad. #ketoproblems #ketogenicdiet

1347 2018-03-13 21:27:00 If anyone wondered if @ToyotaGB cars are sturdy, I just drove 80 miles in an Aygo with no oil in it. Bought it and was told it had just had a full service. Checked the dipstick a few days later and empty. That thing should have exploded!
1348 2018-03-13 21:26:37 Fellani dey deceive himself
1349 2018-03-13 21:26:34 Guy at parts desk: He'll need this crush washer or your car car will leak oil.
Me: (gives him puzzled look) Who?
Other guy at parts desk: Or she'll need it, she can change her own oil.
Me: Hahahaha thanks.

(Tbh, I prolly know more about cars than guy # 1)
1350 2018-03-13 21:26:19 “... all the finest people. Believe me.”  — I wasn’t a yuge Rex (the big oil man) Tillerson fan. Time will tell how well he served himself as SOS. But T needs demons to do Putin’s bidding not resistance from a public servant who was listening to his better angels lately.
1351 2018-03-13 21:26:14 First the fence now an oil change, she reall pushing it...

1357 2018-03-13 21:25:52 Tillerson like some others, we had no hope for him because of Oil & Russia. DT woke him up. He actually was protecting us from RUSSIA & PUTIN & unlike the wimpy GOP who denied RUSSIA collusion meddling, a joke, btw. He is STILL saying that YES Russia is a threat! NK hold off!
1358 2018-03-13 21:25:49 OMG Are they going to bring democracy there also...? 

Didn't know there was oil in space...
1359 2018-03-13 21:25:42 @aronlund Do you have any idea what has happened to oil prices in Kurdish North Syria? Has the US facilities importing those portable Chinese refineries that ISIS used so effectively in 2015, before the US destroyed them? Or is region importing oil from Iraq ? Or Syria?
1360 2018-03-13 21:25:40 10ล้านแล้วโว้ยยยยยย
1361 2018-03-13 21:25:32 @patcondell you forget there is a treaty with islamic countries to prevent an oil crisis like there was in 1979. The "european" partners are to prevent dislike and to promote islamic spread. So that explains the current stance

1367 2018-03-13 21:24:32 So they can sell more oil
1368 2018-03-13 21:24:30 It's a sign of the absolutely vile qualities of the Trump administration that I find myself reluctantly on the side of the multimillionaire oil tycoon who decimated the State Department while he led it.
1369 2018-03-13 21:24:30 If you believe Lamb is a Trump Democrat I have an oil well in Connecticut to sell you.
1370 2018-03-13 21:24:28 This is great!!! Tillerson, the guy the Democraps LOVED TO HATE, IS NOW GREAT TO THEM??? How did he win their favor, thotties thot he was an oil can...

1372 2018-03-13 21:24:21 "what Mason and the oil barons fear is not the distorting power of foreign wealth. What they fear are the facts. People campaign against the Kinder Morgan pipeline not because the Rockefellers told them to, but because of basic reality."

That's true.

1374 2018-03-13 21:24:05 Nah, don’t take it to get oil changed, go get your nails done girl. Lol oil change are so easy. Just do it yourself.

1387 2018-03-13 21:22:54 @BKactual I'm confused, didn't Trump get heaps of shit for hiring a "oil rich conglomerate douche" Rex in the first place? Now Rex is the poor soul.

1390 2018-03-13 21:22:49 Just realized I picked up a Moleskine journal with notebook paper instead of sketchbook paper in my excitement when I spotted the moleskine display. I kinda hate myself, bc that stuff's 16€.

It lasted trough oil paint though, so let's see what watercolor will do to it!
1391 2018-03-13 21:22:47 sure does, Daud ... petrol and oil in my veins 
1392 2018-03-13 21:22:47 Notley is similar albeit not at that degree. Alberta’s economic growth has mainly been due to spinoffs from public spending since the oil price collapse. Unsustainable for long term.
1393 2018-03-13 21:22:33 Exactly, now we just need to find some deep oil drillers.

1395 2018-03-13 21:22:31 Q: “Does the federal government care about the provinces or is it more about foreign investment in oil that are more the driving motivations?”
1396 2018-03-13 21:22:22 You drank the snake oil. Where are the road and bridge repairs? We have a gas tax for this. So what the hell you bitchin about guzzler? I'll wait.

1401 2018-03-13 21:22:08 I really would be down except for I really did get my car oil changed and registered so my leisure fund has been sucked dry... Give me a month and you're on.
1402 2018-03-13 21:22:06 Or just plain oil...
1403 2018-03-13 21:22:02 Big pan, toss in oil first. Then add stock and simmer/reduce. Have to break down all the hard bits (takes about 8 mins) but then is surprisingly delicious. Like lovely spring greens.

1457 2018-03-13 21:15:50 Which brand of castor oil did you use?
1458 2018-03-13 21:15:48 Stan, stop talking jingoistiic rubbish. UK have to do joint investigation as agreed by international law. It’s about Syria, Iran, NATO, oil+gas+ demonising Russia+China as threaten areas of interest. Also, stops domestic scrutiny such as brexit+austerity votes. Research and read.
1459 2018-03-13 21:15:42 Kale is nice but only really when sautéed. Little bit of garlic and oil, then half a cup of stock and simmer till evaporated. I laugh when people talk about eating raw kale - the human digestive system can’t break it down. This is why cows have four stomachs.
1460 2018-03-13 21:15:30 I second that, you know I ALWAYS over pluck. I use 100% castor oil and it works wonders!! Just make sure you get the kind that comes in a dark brown bottle. It kinda makes them grow crazy so you’ll have to do reshaping but so worth it

1462 2018-03-13 21:15:17 Whoops, unless it's greasy a big if splash won't matter. Persil powder seems to extract grease (gets oil off the drive too) we filled a plastic cup and taped it to the wall with masking tape and shifted grease overnight. We live in perma-chaos!

1483 2018-03-13 21:12:44 We must careful that the business environment in the country isn’t turning overly hostile towards multi-national oil and gas corporations. It seems the "take your platform and go" thinking is not limited to the labour unions. I am hearing some worrying things.
1484 2018-03-13 21:12:26 And worse the discourse is now about ‘imported’ workers, you know? Like socks, or oil, forins are just another commodity? Workers of the world unite, right? Except here, jus piss off seems the message...

1490 2018-03-13 21:11:43 Not sure where are you getting your numbers but oil numbers above the $60 have only been reached in the last couple of months of 2018. Before that all prices were lower than $60. In addition historically, prices have been up and down and deficit has followed accordingly.
1491 2018-03-13 21:11:43 it's almost like Tillerson's initial friendly relations with Putin due to his many years in the oil sector and several personal meetings with the dude were later overshadowed by his condemnation of an assassination by Russia and his immediate firing for it

1498 2018-03-13 21:10:58 We all use oil for our economy . The safest way to move it is with pipelines .
1499 2018-03-13 21:10:54 Yeah, valve cover seals often slowly leak around the top of the engine on older engines, plus it kinda looks like the oil pan seal might be leaking too (the oil near the oil filter).
1500 2018-03-13 21:10:51 Can see the oil dripping out the refs pockets.
1501 2018-03-13 21:10:39 The thing is there are junctions if you were to give right of way to every car and boda. You would never join the road. Think of that mini road about at  Acacia City Oil. If you gave all the cars going to Mulago towards right of way around 6pm. You might as well park up
1502 2018-03-13 21:10:34 Look again. There is plenty of pipeline capacity to carry the oil to refineries in Ontario and Quebec. Don’t let the oily interests tell you otherwise
1503 2018-03-13 21:10:21 @LebaAlf 

Also into crockpot: vegetable oil, brown sugar and white sugar and 2-3 skunk beers.

1512 2018-03-13 21:09:36 It's all part of Putin's aim to destabilise the West. The Russians have already said with a degree of glee that this will worsen UK/ Russia relations. Posturing and pointing out how weak we'll be on our own! Who has the gas and oil pipelines eh?

1525 2018-03-13 21:08:02 All it does is kill, maim and subjugate. It replaces industry with praying. They don't produce anything. Only oil gave them wealth. That's why they're doing what they're doing. When oil runs out, they'd be stuck in the desert, if they hadn't invaded everywhere else.

1535 2018-03-13 21:07:02 This is not a failure of climate activists, but a failure of education, media, and people to think about it for even half a second.  Isn't it as simple as telling people that most natural gas is found in oil wells?
1536 2018-03-13 21:06:52 As is your left wing adoration. Are the oil companies or farmers any less deserving of the PM's attention? Ottawa loves the revenue but avoids any controversial support of industries. They need reassurance and action as well.

1539 2018-03-13 21:06:31 Inflammation, too!  I was reading about how oils are being heated, and that changes the nature of the oil, even olive.  Heating it makes it harmful because plant and nut oils are chemically changed by heat into inflammatory substances.  Interesting research going on!
1540 2018-03-13 21:06:24 It's appalling that the oil and gas industry would be used as an excuse. This does nothing to address the real reasons.

1544 2018-03-13 21:05:59 Try cutting the cauliflower in thick slices using the root as base.  Blanch the slices for 30 seconds, chill in iced water, pat dry and baste lightly in olive oil. Then on the plancha, finally dress. You will get crunch and colour. And it won't taste or look burnt.
1545 2018-03-13 21:05:58 ... currently as oil prices increased unemployment rates have also decreased following the trend. Much of the deficit was due to maintaining the current programs with a decrease in royalties from the Oil and Gas industry.

1570 2018-03-13 21:04:01 Therefore the deficit made sense since we are a oil dependent province. The figures for Oil prices were also reflected in unemployment figures in the province which since 2014 have steadily increased following the trend of oil prices...

1581 2018-03-13 21:03:18 I was baking and forgot my dog was obsessed with coconut oil...might’ve let him lick the spoon when I was done with it.
1582 2018-03-13 21:03:11 Wat kind of oil?
1583 2018-03-13 21:03:05 Those countries do not and are unstable/war torn/or dependent on one resource like oil. All instances of hyperinflation due to government spending have some combo of those characteristics. (2/2)

1585 2018-03-13 21:02:42 Saudi Arabia offers us nothing but radical Islamic terrorism and competition to our oil industry.  I would think they'd be a much higher priority, yet,  they get the red carpet
1586 2018-03-13 21:02:40 Hi @MaximeJonesLloy we're really sorry that you weren't contacted this afternoon. A member of the team will be in touch first thing tomorrow morning, thank you for your understanding during this busy period.
1587 2018-03-13 21:02:24 Trump is president.  He’s such a badass he just fired Rex Tillerson.  Imagine you were that badass that you could fire in oil exec from SoS. You are just jealous and angry dude.

1589 2018-03-13 21:02:05 The reason why it failed is socialist economy based on exporting oil and when saudi arabia lowered their oil prices they got screwed, so you can blame the US all you want but socialism had never worked and will never work period.
1590 2018-03-13 21:02:03 Egypt and Jordan are US allies.
Egypt got its revolution, nothing foreign it it.

And would be good that West stop to pour oil on middle East.

1593 2018-03-13 21:01:50 In June 2014 the prices of oil were around $110, during the crisis from 2014 to the current date the prices have all fluctuated under the $110. Currently the price is at one of the highest moments at $61 which is significantly lower than pre-crisis.

1597 2018-03-13 21:01:19 I must be really pessimistic, but I think after it came out that Tillerson was picked by Putin they need a good exit for him. He has done a lot for the Oil Industry while diminishing the State Department. And 45s supporters would buy what’s being woven.

Rex Tillerson was the CEO of Exxon Mobile during BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

He’s not crooked enough for Donald Trump.

Let that shit sink in.
1614 2018-03-13 20:59:48 That big oil money
1615 2018-03-13 20:59:47 I agree. The even better part about $RTI is thier tobacco nicotine extraction   the possiblities are endless and they are already building the oil facility as we speak. Wont be long until they are making money from everywhere
1616 2018-03-13 20:59:46 seems like palm oil is always in the "accidentally" vegans stuff like oreos and crisps and cinnamon rolls - all products that i very much doubt the 5% of the population that is vegan is responsible for the majority of sales of.

1685 2018-03-13 20:52:43 Salt, pepper, oil. Roast at 400 for 15, then check in few minute incriments until said desired char and doneness is achieved. Fork tender and crispy for me.
1686 2018-03-13 20:52:34 Already on record opposing #AlisoCanyon! My opponent is taking oil money for campaign. I refuse to take oil money.
1687 2018-03-13 20:52:19 There were over 8,000 protesting here and 200 from Alberta.  You said people from outside BC didn’t count.      Albertans can be pro-pipeline since the oil spill won’t affect them.
1688 2018-03-13 20:52:03 A very simple one... Heat up a pan of oil and you'll see convection cells self organise.
1689 2018-03-13 20:51:50 I have been faced with barrage of ad homs. I say and have said that Dubyne is too selective in what he covers. I say that he lies in many of his videos. I chased up a couple links in first video I saw—they did not say what said they did. Snake oil!

1691 2018-03-13 20:51:39 I just wish that people would stop looking to government to fix their lives. If your industry tanks (which was my career, I worked for a decade building oil sands facilities/working on rigs) then you need to stop whining, get a skill and get to work.

1701 2018-03-13 20:50:26 I’m a bit surprised at you removing Tillerson. He had a lot of connections and global experience from 30-40 years in the oil business.

I consider it terrible form for Rex to find out over a public post on Twitter that he was being replaced. He  deserved a lot more respect.
1702 2018-03-13 20:50:23 The oil went skidididi pap pap and burnt me :(
1703 2018-03-13 20:50:17 @SBakerMD I just listened to your podcast with Rob for second time over coffee this morning. I am amazed at how close our labs tracks, I wonder if others are tracking similarly. We deviate w/A1c I think as we eat more seafood here. Less protein, more oil?? just a guess
1704 2018-03-13 20:50:17 Regular castor oil doesn't really have a smell but the Jamaican Black castor oil is darker in colour and smells stronger. I've used it so often that I don't even smell it anymore though

1713 2018-03-13 20:49:07 I think we should start with the 1.16 billion dollars in oil subsidies.
1714 2018-03-13 20:49:07 Wonder if firing was planned, what happened to the 500b land/oil deal Rex had with Putin/Rosneft  or maybe mueller was getting close- who knows!  Pompeo has to be dirty to work for 45 - its a requirement!
1715 2018-03-13 20:48:50 what sucked about that part of NY was you would get humid 100-degree summers full of mosquitos, AND awful 0-degree winters where you need to put a blanket and space heater on your oil tank to keep it from gelling overnight

1721 2018-03-13 20:48:04 Wait, I thought the HIRING of Tillerson proved collusion because of his apparent ties to Kremlin Oil.
1722 2018-03-13 20:47:57 Well, political foes will have forgotten the very headlines they published about Tillerson's ties to Russia & his oil interests as well as the Tillerson & Trump acrimony from day 1. As always, media sways with their 'feelings' not facts of the day. CNN/MSN will fight for him now.
1723 2018-03-13 20:47:50 Hey! I used As I Am Coconut Cowash & mixed it with olive oil, Jamaican castor oil & vitamin E oil, then I rinsed it with cold water ( & that really defined my curls-- trust me it makes a difference) then i just coiled it with the As I Am twist defining cream. Hope this helps!

1725 2018-03-13 20:47:20 I worry that if I use an oil as a moisturizer, it’ll get on my lashes when I close my eyes or something. Or that I will accidentally rub my face and then rub my eyes. The transfer it’s just too much of a risk of ruining my lashes.

1733 2018-03-13 20:46:30 Back to big bucks in the oil industry. Guess Putin didn't need him anymore.
1734 2018-03-13 20:46:13 Tillerson was brought on to clear up Russia sanctions and get new business deals quickly then leave and go back to whatever oil company would hire him. Then the Trump/Russia investigation stalled all of that. Just my two cents.

1739 2018-03-13 20:45:55 LRT: North Dakota legislatures were willing to consider a bill that would allow people to run over protesters with their cars because NoDAPL protesters were making the oil interests that run this state mad.
1740 2018-03-13 20:45:46 Starting to think Putin misread the situation. Thought he’d have another puppet based on oil interests and pushed him out when Tillerson held the line.

2) turn the tap off to BC
3) separate from the “rest” of Canada
You can’t pick 1) & 2) together.

1763 2018-03-13 20:42:33 A bit worried of these news that 2018 will be recession in oil price, stock market and crypto as well.
When i look at support and resistance lines on btc/usd it will collide on april 1st approximately. So the price will have to go up or down.  Thats why i asked in previous tweet.
1764 2018-03-13 20:42:25 But....the world doesn't need oil. I'll admit we have an immediate need for it due to current infrastructure but we absolutely don't need it for the rest of our lives. Not to mention it is finite. Better to rip off the bandaid, no?

1783 2018-03-13 20:39:59 Somebody, maybe a dem, suggested that Tillerson may have been chosen specifically to deal with the oil, which is the underlying key to the Middle East. Done with that Pompeo may make more sense.

1820 2018-03-13 20:35:52 Yer but they spent all oil money n dat I cud get 2 top Ov league wiv all that cash
1821 2018-03-13 20:35:41 About 3 years ago also worked in Tripoli and on one of the oil fields training the workers on how to do motor vehicle repair, was going good until the oil field received a credible threat from a militant group against the oil company
1822 2018-03-13 20:35:35 Yeah I’m gucci  shit smell like burnt popcorn & coconut oil tho

& then obviously here’s that money of panic lmaooo
1823 2018-03-13 20:35:34 i don’t even have time to get my oil changed now i love it
1824 2018-03-13 20:35:25 Sliced up some thin steaks, pan fried them with fresh garlic and butter, added cooked rice with frozen peas and carrots, 2 eggs scrambled , with soy sauce and sesame oil to my liking, and let it cook together for about 10 minutes!! So dang good!!!!!
1825 2018-03-13 20:35:22 So? He was big oil you guys hated him anyway remember
1826 2018-03-13 20:35:22 There are oil rigs in Bridgend, don't you know. Smells Scottish though.

1829 2018-03-13 20:35:04 I’m gonna say this again but coconut oil is a major key!!
1830 2018-03-13 20:35:01 #TheShapeOfTheWater has me craving cod liver oil and I’m scared.
1831 2018-03-13 20:34:50 But who would have thought I'd have far more respect for an ex oil CEO than our president? I sure never imagined. Tillerson has more integrity in his little finger than Trump has ever had. Used car salesmen are probably offended by Trump & his propensity to LIE & distort truth!
1832 2018-03-13 20:34:43 try tea tree oil, it's a super effective anti-microbial
1833 2018-03-13 20:34:36 This is all a pipe dream. No matter what anyone does, in 300 yrs none of these power sources will remain in significant quantities. The role the depletion of the oil supply will play is underestimated by everyone. And know what? When all this shit is gone we'll be better for it.
1834 2018-03-13 20:34:19 You said "women are moving forward w/o oil". Challenged you on that - not possible. Agreed w/you on CA. FNs support pipelines. What didn't you understand?
1835 2018-03-13 20:34:17 castor oil works wonders on ur eyebrows .. you’re welcome
1836 2018-03-13 20:34:06 Two things I cannot wait to put in plate first to eat - ground beef and plantain..  Plantain mem I eating half before it touch the oil
1837 2018-03-13 20:34:00 When we study the Marxist coup in 1917, we see two things, a long standing public small time riot street banner set of groups, about 7, and then a large, silent, highly skilled Bolshevik group, 3500 in number, trained on Standard Oil NJ property in electronics, press, commando.
1838 2018-03-13 20:33:57 Car in the shop getting fixed as we speak  oil change & new tires tommorow then Thursday I’m sxsw ready
1839 2018-03-13 20:33:54 Mexico can sell their oil anywhere, but no other country buys near as much as we do. The wall would help Mexico too, it would help with their "war" on the cartels, which is probably why so many Mexican politicians are against it. The corruption over there is rampant.
1840 2018-03-13 20:33:52 This would be nice in sort of an "oil on canvas" vibe.   Lots of potential.    Get the painters working on this ASAP.
1841 2018-03-13 20:33:49 With their oil money, they oiled so many in the UK.  They're forever linked to Moscow. In my opinion this assassination was directly aimed at those indebted to the dark corridors of Kremlin. Lavrov is correct. Skripal was useless to Russia -but his body's not.
1842 2018-03-13 20:33:46 At this point ima just ride down the wrong side of the freeway in reverse wit TO THE TOP playin while I’m crying to a 5th of orange oil 
1843 2018-03-13 20:33:44 1/4 of 1% commission on a $500Bn russian oil deal is $1.25Bn.  Tex drillerson was motivated by that potential commission since pooty had given him the russian medal of friendship.  Followvthe rubles.
1844 2018-03-13 20:33:30 The reason #RexTillersonFired was even SOS was because putin wanted him to be there! And to remove sanctions so they can finalize a 7 trillion dollar oil deal  that deal went off the table now he has nothing to do there!
1845 2018-03-13 20:33:28 Referendum - where I come from nothing gets past that affects all our lives in such a huge way without our voices, health is priority  #greed is a cancer by choice, oil spills are a health hazard - this is pure dictatorship #bcpoli #cdnpoli #oiloff we got solar/wind/water power
1846 2018-03-13 20:33:28  "He showed up in boots,
An oil-man suit, 
10 gallon hat in hand.

1847 2018-03-13 20:33:20 I do the essential oil rituals after shampooing. Does that make a difference?
1848 2018-03-13 20:33:18 I use oil from some company in Bridgend plus candles - sorted.

1851 2018-03-13 20:32:55 1991: The United States Department of Justice announces that Exxon has agreed to pay $1 billion for the clean-up of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. #otd #tdih
1852 2018-03-13 20:32:52 Idk what it is but something in my living room reeks of oil paint and i just had war flashbacks of sophomore year
1853 2018-03-13 20:32:42 If the head of a giant oil compnay with no expierence isn't crooked enough for you. I don't want to see who is.

1858 2018-03-13 20:31:55 Ewan what 'record' defence? A hearts record? Which btw conceded an oil shaw goal at home which the ref decided not to give
1859 2018-03-13 20:31:42 Sure i have oil and and a slippery tounge for help 
1860 2018-03-13 20:31:38 Snake oil scam. If you believe this like you believed Mexico would pay for it your sadly mistaken.
1861 2018-03-13 20:31:38 Gee, I thought she changed her own oil in her car! So much for that trusty wrench. Too busy padding her campaign war chest to do her fucking job!!
1862 2018-03-13 20:31:34 TFW it's been about 17 hours since frying flour tortillas in coconut oil, melting cheese on them, then adding a significant amount of jalapenos seemed like an awesome idea.
1863 2018-03-13 20:31:33 OIL, 15M chart pops above 20MA finally, volatility ON FULL, UWT ?
1864 2018-03-13 20:31:29 Didn't that same "media" complain Tillerson was "an evil Oil Man!" Why ate their panties in a bunch now?
1865 2018-03-13 20:31:20 Do you have any clove oil?
1866 2018-03-13 20:31:16 So why are the 99% being forced into capitulation by the 1%? Libs are all for democracy/ majority rule, till they are not.
1867 2018-03-13 20:31:04 51 FNs support the pipeline. Fossil fuels are the largest FN employers. Neil Young criticized AB oilsands. Oh, and neither women nor men can move forward without oil. Name a viable replacement.

1871 2018-03-13 20:30:54 Rather large drug bust on South MLK Blvd on Friday. Four pounds of pot. LSD. An ounce of pot oil, Adderall and three handguns. 25-yo facing multiple charges. Haven't seen an LSD bust in a while
1872 2018-03-13 20:30:46 i hope that this oil change doesn’t take long so i can go home and smoke a bowl before i go back to work
1873 2018-03-13 20:30:39 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
1874 2018-03-13 20:30:37 Refrigeration isn’t necessary but it will slow natural oil separation. If you refrigerate, we recommend returning to room temp before serving, for a more spreadable texture.
1875 2018-03-13 20:30:24 @OANDA suggestions:
*more products including big indexe countries (Swiss/Brasil/Kospi etc..)
*Revise margins, why does it take 2x margin for nikkei than oil while later is a lot more volatile
*Implement spreads with correct margining ie long US500 Short US30 like  for Gold/Silver
1876 2018-03-13 20:30:23 algo madness... #oil
1877 2018-03-13 20:30:19 Why didn't you just say Tillerson was being cautious approving Russia's oil pipeline and Pimpeo will throw caution to the wind.
1878 2018-03-13 20:30:17 Big surprise Shapiro thinks Sec’s of State for Democratic admins were all worse than an oil baron with no international diplomacy or policy experience whose purpose was to gut the agency.  What a thinker.

1880 2018-03-13 20:30:07 @billtu did you watch todays episode of This Morning? Cannabis oil vs cancer, THC attacks cancer cells.
1881 2018-03-13 20:29:54 Steyer is a meddling self appointed high priest of the environmental religion. He made his billions in oil but wants us to live in the dark literally. Tom should give all his money to buy rainforests and go live in one like the Druid he is.
1882 2018-03-13 20:29:43 With a skin care/make-up routine that consists solely of a daily coconut oil application, I can't figure out why I consistently get make-up ads on social media. Unless the internet thinks I'm ugly 
1883 2018-03-13 20:29:34 Ive needed to change my oil a while and kept procrastinating. Its pretty bad when a mechanic says its the worst he has ever seen
1884 2018-03-13 20:29:30 Give up the "war for oil" speech! already had 2 "wars for oil". For which we got none.  Oil is sold on a worldwide market. It's not like we lined up tankers in the Persian gulf to take it home with us like war spoils
1885 2018-03-13 20:29:15 Agbor Dick Temitope paid N50800 to Odogun Alase Temitope being payment for Palm Oil
1886 2018-03-13 20:29:01 When appointed #RexTillerson was hammered for bn close to Russia, oil interests n all that. Now, he is the darling of all. Crazy buggers.
1887 2018-03-13 20:28:43 ate tuna in a regrettable oil
1888 2018-03-13 20:28:36 Yes they would be buying back our utilities that thatcher sold off, and squandered the money on tax cuts, that’s without the oil money they had, and we still had 3.5 million unemployed and 17% int rates.
1889 2018-03-13 20:28:28 All this talk (again) about Iran falling under economic sanctions. Not sure how that’s going to help oil price or Saudis for that matter now that US is pumping like never before. Not only that, but removing 1Mbpd of crude while Iran replaces it with gas condensates is pointless.
1890 2018-03-13 20:28:24 @RhonddaBryant and you'll take oil and blood money bribes from Saudi Arabia without batting an eye??? You sicken me.
1891 2018-03-13 20:28:23 I reallyyyyy want a oil diffuser
1892 2018-03-13 20:28:21 USA now a wholly owned subsidiary of the NRA, oil and gas, big Pharma, chemical companies and Putin!!!
1893 2018-03-13 20:28:20 Tillerson, as much as I dislike his ties to big oil, was the only grownup in the administration.  What was left of credibility just exited the page!
1894 2018-03-13 20:28:10 I give up. My ashy legs and this weather. It’s a constant struggle I literally keep having to reapply lotion and oil to try to lock in the moisture
1895 2018-03-13 20:28:08 and again... there is no such plan... there are no such people.
just bloviators playing the "look at me" game. 
it's worse than smoke and mirrors,  it's snake oil salesman taking advantage of the least intelligent among us.
culling the slow sheep with pipe dreams and elixirs.
1896 2018-03-13 20:27:52 you are stupid as hell
ummah is fighting against usa-uk and they are exploiting your resources . you are funding their wars against islam. with the oil you have any sane nation would establish a giant empire yet you turnt your cities into Mallistans. still needing us protection
1897 2018-03-13 20:27:38 And then it happened
She touched me For the lips of A strange woman Drop as a honeycomb And her mouth was Smoother than oil But her inner spirit and words Were as sharp as A two-edged sword But I loved it Cause it's dangerous.
1898 2018-03-13 20:27:03 Nope oil was a bonus
1899 2018-03-13 20:27:03 Was it in our national interest, for BIG OIL to drill, at he UNITED STATES  NAVAL OIL RESERVE, at TEAPOT DOME??
1900 2018-03-13 20:26:43 We own a #Fiat 500 2013, oil changes, one battery changed, tires (tyres if you're a Brit), that's it so far so good.
1901 2018-03-13 20:26:33 @BerkeleyJr  The Problem with Tillerson has always been his pro Iran and pro OPEC oil.  Tillerson definitely not a fan of fracking and U.S. oil production growth. 

Tillerson is also anti-Israel which does not fit in with Trump's position on the Middle East
1902 2018-03-13 20:25:57 My room just smells like olbas oil and I’m not okay with that
1903 2018-03-13 20:25:44 No I’ve never bitten into a fish oil pill, but I guess I’ll have to try it sometime
1904 2018-03-13 20:25:40 Golly, I hope you're right.  Dunno if I'll hear of it, here in the oil patch near Woodlands, but mebbe.

1909 2018-03-13 20:25:01 Tillerson can now make the big oil deal for exon with the Russians since puppet boy still hasn't put any sanctions on the Russians!
1910 2018-03-13 20:25:01 Rex tillerson sound like the name of an evil oil Barron. Which he is! How cute
1911 2018-03-13 20:24:57 We ARE better off w/out the Koch-pimp Putin awardee oil baron as SOS, but Pompeo is even worse
1912 2018-03-13 20:24:54 Ottomans treared us as second class citizens, while the UK and US helped us discover the oil, build our countries, gain independence and maintain peace. That’s why we like them and despise you. 
1913 2018-03-13 20:24:54 If confirmed (and that's no certain lock), we'll go from Exxon's CEO heading the State Department to Koch's one-time favorite congressman. Exxon and Koch each have extensive oil interests in Russia.

1916 2018-03-13 20:24:26 Its even worse when you picture it being a multivitamin or a fish oil pill. The huge ones.
1917 2018-03-13 20:24:25 I take the opportunity when I’m not socializing or auditioning, to sport a high bun infused with coconut oil, and walk around with a mask of Vitamin E oil on my face, so essentially I’m just a grease ball in my day to day life and I feel good about that use of personal time.
1918 2018-03-13 20:24:19 We’re not missing him.  Rex Tillerson did untold amounts of damage to consumers and Mother Earth while head of Exxon.  Did you forget Tillerson ordered Exxon to fight accountability after the Alaska oil spill? 15 years worth of fighting in court.
1919 2018-03-13 20:24:14 . @SenJohnMcCain @SpeakerRyan Your president just fired his oil tycoon secretary of state because he accused Russia of wrongdoing. Are you spineless cowards going to do anything about this? Wake up and smell the roses. You work for Putin.
1920 2018-03-13 20:24:09 Trump is a cheap snake oil salesman. A charlatan.
1921 2018-03-13 20:24:05 Only they concerned is which type of shoes am wearing to put the blame on me...shoes or no shoes oil on the floor is a risk to customers @PicknPay
1922 2018-03-13 20:24:03 Which is why it pisses me off no end that abortion opponents get to decide not to fund a legal procedure. I would like not to fund the subsidies given to oil and coal industries. I would like to not fund escalation of our war machine. I would like not to fund a lot of things.
1923 2018-03-13 20:23:58 Time to as a minimum explore off of Florida’s shores for oil and natural gas. If large deposits are found then drilling can begin. Find it and extract it. It’s the moral thing to do.

1926 2018-03-13 20:23:48 so uh after this year I never want to eat food with oil in it
1927 2018-03-13 20:23:47 I really want bacon but do I really want to get splashed by hot oil today? 
1928 2018-03-13 20:23:46 dirty oil
1929 2018-03-13 20:23:45 Tillerson is an long time oil man - TRANSLATION:  BUSHITE   How many times did Tillerson either contradict POTUS position or failed to act as directed?  POTUS is the supreme commander of our country.  We elected him to make those decisions - not some political appointee.
1930 2018-03-13 20:23:43 Trump is starting to frame *everything* as a risk of "national security."

Oil/gas drilling, tax cuts for the corps/wealthy, tariffs, state policies ...
1931 2018-03-13 20:23:31 Yeah but you're not allowed to mention that shush! Remember it's City buying titles and paying for the football they play! Oil money! Don't forget the narrative!
1932 2018-03-13 20:23:30 I don't care. He took the job to help Putin and their grand oil deal. Was useless as SOS. He should consider himself lucky to get out with no indictments.
1933 2018-03-13 20:23:14 Its a constant thing all over the world. You just now noticing this? #shitholecountry
1934 2018-03-13 20:23:12 Blonde, do you really think a company WANTS an oil spill? It's expensive & bad4 business. Many R caused by incompetent employees not following safety procedures. All the regs in the world won't stop that. What's good4 corp is good4 our 401ks & economy. No jobs=no life.
1935 2018-03-13 20:23:05 If you DM us your details we will assist you because we would prefer to deliver your oil seeing as we have your money - Thank you
1936 2018-03-13 20:23:05 ...keeping in mind that bunker C and bituminous oil are heavier than the brackish waters in this area and therefore sink.
1937 2018-03-13 20:23:02 Go get a oil change and something else wrong wtf
1938 2018-03-13 20:23:01 Please be alert when you visit the @PicknPay black heath ....the floors have oil...ur life is at risk

1941 2018-03-13 20:22:56 She got coconut oil and everything I’m doooooooone 
1942 2018-03-13 20:22:44 Saw a few ants in the kitchen today so I rubbed down the baseboards and cabinets with peppermint oil. Now my house smells like a candy cane.
1943 2018-03-13 20:22:19 And all the while increasing the Nat res output of oil & Nat Gas.
1944 2018-03-13 20:22:14 Hey, remember when you had to carry a crank handle in your car, and carry spare fan belts, radiator hoses, top up your oil every fuel fill? 
Have you no faith that we can with the right mix of renewables and storage be really smart?
1945 2018-03-13 20:22:10 Either way, we need the oil, it could reduce tanker traffic due to not buying from the U.S. and Canada runs off of selling resources, to deny that revenue stream is ridiculous to be honest.
1946 2018-03-13 20:22:06 Tillerson is also a Globalist and wanted to use the position of power to achieve getting oil contracts in Russia for Exxon but that went south due to the Russia witch hunt and decline in relations with the US.

1952 2018-03-13 20:21:40 We will never fully understand stuff like this. All I know is that it’s evil and that Satan rule their lives.
Same thing with the torture of farmers. Drilling holes in them and burning with hot oil etc. 
how can humans do that?

(I'd feel worse for him if he didn't happily decimate the State Department and gut the environment for oil companies.) Still . . . Pretty cold.
1954 2018-03-13 20:21:29 I would paint all the walls there are in the world with oil pastel

1957 2018-03-13 20:21:18 It was about 5 mins in to the couples massage when it hit me there's a gorj woman rubbing oil on my boyfs body less than a meter away
1958 2018-03-13 20:21:13 @richardbranson. They say that a squeaky gate gets the oil. I am that gate. Please sir, my friend has an Msc. Petroleum Engineering. He is  astute. # reply.
1959 2018-03-13 20:21:12 That ufo oil is really worth it sis?????
1960 2018-03-13 20:21:10 Olive oil and salt? Messy but effective.
1961 2018-03-13 20:21:06 @PicknPay black heath ..your staff was aware of the oil on the floor. This was negligence and inconsiderate.
1962 2018-03-13 20:21:00 In fact the deep insecurity is because unlike robber barons of the past who sold oil or steel it's increasingly unclear if the product they sell is really a net good for even their customers
1963 2018-03-13 20:21:00 Lemon/vinegar for raw chilli.  Oil for cooked chillies

1966 2018-03-13 20:20:50 You got that right haha. -180 is not a likeable number. At least we're both on the Oil 
1967 2018-03-13 20:20:50 So you admit to doing research, but then you say that people who actually do the research, researchers, have all been collectively and simultaneously duped. What you have done is read a few BS articles farmed out by think tanks paid by Big oil
1968 2018-03-13 20:20:47 Happy birthday my fellow Canucks. You made us mighty proud. Only a stupid cheapshot kept you from your own perfect birthday gift. With hinch on a team, it's exciting to watch racing again .

1971 2018-03-13 20:20:25 Actually, the oil was there much earlier than that. It’s been geologically proven how many years it takes for oil to form... :)

1974 2018-03-13 20:20:09 That’s shocking. All that dirt and oil and bacteria from the hands on rare books.
1975 2018-03-13 20:20:07 Let's not kid ourselves: Tillerson was appointed solely based on his relationship with Russia/Putin and that, of course, based on the premise of the gas and oil connection.

1977 2018-03-13 20:20:00 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
1978 2018-03-13 20:19:59 Capitalism is a wonderful thing. Mexico can sell their oil ANYWHERE! BTW, without a Social Security number, people can't collect anything from the government, and can't even file to get back overpaid taxes. As for medical bills, I'm happy 2 help people who need medical assistance

1981 2018-03-13 20:19:04 @Mlb should have teams work together to have a visiting team grill at their parks. Have these items on menu when the team comes to play.

1992 2018-03-13 20:17:10 In his adult life, Trump has probably never done an oil change, plumbing, electricity, or wall board---and he stands there giving us a lecture about a chain link fence and being able to "cut" through it. Really?

2019 2018-03-13 20:14:24 Wondering if you put that to referendum, would you be able to say Canadians? In up coming election I would like to see as a referendum that ALL Canadians have their say. Oil and gas pipelines we need yes or no. Remove carbon tax yes or no.
2020 2018-03-13 20:14:21 Abi o. They should sha accept it that no more free access to our growing treasury. They did all they could to drain it while oil was selling at record high. Mo more! Shameless people.

2023 2018-03-13 20:14:00 It was just so easy when the wrong people for the job were named like Captain Planet villains. Now I have to think about a name in a headline before I can be like "Oh! That's the one who wants more money for oil companies!" or "He wants to infringe on my civil liberties!"
2024 2018-03-13 20:14:00 Today we ran out of heating oil, but then our delivery came early and I (and the internet) taught myself how to bleed the line and restart the furnace. I’m happy, warm, and smell like diesel. It’s a good day.

2031 2018-03-13 20:13:10 Lmao no. I just got EVERYTHING fixed. I had an oil leak & it turned out to be a broken o-ring & that was $400+ I went ahead & got all my brakes done & you know that was $500 for everything new
2032 2018-03-13 20:13:05 I remember a somewhat puzzled hazel-eyed ISFJ oil heiress, slowly tearing the seams of a pine green scarf, rapidly transforming her understanding of a magical calico Gypsy Vanner horse.

2034 2018-03-13 20:13:03 @mrlube Terrible experience. Drove my vehicle in for a basic oil change. Leave with it barely running. $460 mechanic bill to fix what was caused by you. You deny my claim. Then provide me a manager number that isn't even the person you claim it to be. THIS IS BRUTAL.

2038 2018-03-13 20:12:51 Many cultures advocate drinking a spoonful of oil in the morning on an empty stomach for a healthy system.

2042 2018-03-13 20:12:36 What would an oil spill do to the value of real estate here? Is this expansion really about supplying our fuel needs here or a deception to increase oil tankers and shipments to Asia...carbon tax free?

2046 2018-03-13 20:12:07 @FinlessFoods It would be so cool if you could find a way to synthesize fish oil (for supplements).

2054 2018-03-13 20:10:48 THE ALABASTER OIL:
What lesson can be drawn from from the incident of "the woman with alabaster jar of perfume?'' (See Luke 7: 37-50 KJV). Why are we so quick to judge people who are morally ''bankrupt?''
2055 2018-03-13 20:10:43 Take your used oil to a auto parts store. Be responsible
2056 2018-03-13 20:10:42 Albertan success was being driven from just one industry. While oil workers make great money, they have few skills that can be transported to other industry, and especially lacking skills that could pay anywhere near the rigs.
2057 2018-03-13 20:10:39 No I find it a bit too heavy, I'm using almond oil right now I really like it
2058 2018-03-13 20:10:38 I would ease up on the fat a little especially mct oil if you are taking it. That also includes coconut oil. Just try and stick with it and allow your body time to adapt.

2067 2018-03-13 20:09:34 Russia has started selling some of its oil in Renminbi rather than US dollar. Remember Russia is worlds biggest producer of oil, and by Russias actions selling in Renminbi means a drop in the US dollar. Usa and uk are panicking.
2068 2018-03-13 20:09:29 I know your struggle. Once spilled boiling water on my arm. Definitely wasn't fun. Fresh aloe vera and Vitamin E oil helped it heal very quickly though.
2069 2018-03-13 20:09:21 If it was permanent I’d want to go back and see what I could do to head off Brexit, Trump and sort out climate change. Maybe take solar energy back and give it to African nations so they could power the world, end our reliance on oil, and not be in debt.
2070 2018-03-13 20:09:16 Have you also tried CBD oil?
2071 2018-03-13 20:09:15 As Canadians, we are blessed to stand upon massive resource wealth, the 2nd largest known oil and gas resources in the world - yet we pay far more for gas than our southern neighbours - BECAUSE OF TAXES.  Drill, pump, ship and sell now.

2077 2018-03-13 20:08:16 What ground work? #Tillerson treated State as if it was an oil company and chased out all the senior people who had decades of hard-won knowledge so he could replace them with middle management know-nothings. Idiot! Be that as it may, he was marginally better than #Trump.
2078 2018-03-13 20:07:59 Was he the one that broke the news thatAPC borrowed 11 trn? So now he is fake news pastor? You and I won't be there when they meet. He is fake news pastor and ur man offered him oil bloc? Continue
2079 2018-03-13 20:07:54 Don't even try that statement! Even steel workers know it was not a done deal for them. Why does government use steel from China? How about 200k that work in oil and gas industry  he does nothing for them. He is only out trying to gather votes period. Campaigning on our taxes!
2080 2018-03-13 20:07:50 Koch brothers launched his business and political careers, is it any wonder he's in it to make Russian oil sanctions a thing of the past??
2081 2018-03-13 20:07:37 It's ok though. Once Trump finishes imposing all the tariffs and the world economy crashes no one will be able to afford gas anymore and the oil companies will go out of business even without the lawsuit. Also, Tillersons' Exxon stock will crater. Trump's final revenge. #MAGA
2082 2018-03-13 20:07:35 I understand it is clean energy but it seems weird that they have so much oil there. Then I think about bombs for some reason.

2085 2018-03-13 20:06:51 You can still put food in stores and ambulances on the road without promoting your foreign oil companies shipping oil through B.C. waters to foreign shores for what? AB tax revenue? There’s enough demand in North America without force feeding us this risk! #bcpoli #cdnpoli

If Sasol manufactures fuel from coal and gas... why do we still pay the same fuel prices as other companies that use imported crude oil...??? 
I would think that it should be cheaper as coal and gas is much cheaper than crude oil...???

2098 2018-03-13 20:05:25 on a serious note, when you get home if you soak your feet in warm water with lavender or peppermint essential oil and rest an ice pack on your neck it should help and then if you can, take some melatonin tonight to sleep
2099 2018-03-13 20:05:20 Trump Tower Moscow, Russian arctic oil fields, Golden Showers.. the possibilities are endless.
2100 2018-03-13 20:05:17 Bio oil
2101 2018-03-13 20:05:02 I’m making everyone at my job put on some stress relief oil, so they can stop bitching over nothing. 
2102 2018-03-13 20:05:01 Oh how I miss the look of oil base gloss  looks great Nick 
2103 2018-03-13 20:04:51 Comment la langue latine - qui donnera plus tard les langues d'oïl, puis le français strandard - est apparue en France ?
2104 2018-03-13 20:04:46 Why not go after the oil industry or the insurance companies who are scamming Medicare? Almost every major drug company offers help for paying..if you are covered by a good plan you have a co-pay until your deductible is met, then no OOP costs. Lower income people get Medicaid .
2105 2018-03-13 20:04:44 Taking bets on a sure thing seems like a pretty terrible business model.
2106 2018-03-13 20:04:43 Professor was like “what happens if you don’t change your oil?” I’m sure she meant her car lol
2107 2018-03-13 20:04:42 Anybody use jojoba oil ?
2108 2018-03-13 20:04:41 We are in a new world when we're sad about a Big Oil Exec getting sacked. Yeah, it's not from an oil company, but it's still weird & new.
2109 2018-03-13 20:04:33 Actually these goats go up the trees for a purpose it’s is the Argan tree where Argan oil is extracted the goats climb the  tree to eat the shell of the nut then spit out the seed  the villagers pick up the seeds and extract the oil it is a win win situation #TRLT

2115 2018-03-13 20:03:47 So im shipping a tank of olive oil in a large brown wooden box and my name is Basheer Yusef. After the tagic events that happened in Austin recently, everyone in fedex was literally shaking and eye balling me down. The clerk checked my id 3 times and went to the back with it
2116 2018-03-13 20:03:27 I saw this kind of thing in Canada on the National Post. So many disappointing things about Canada in this area. Thank Stephen Harper and his bunch of oil cowboys, and every dude with money and teacher/unionist with a pension that relies on the TSX.

2119 2018-03-13 20:03:09 It’s funny how I always use my coconut oil different depending on the room temperature  If my room is hot, it’s completely liquid. If it’s warm, it’s in chuncks and if it’s cold af it’s super solid
2120 2018-03-13 20:03:03 The texture too! Whether they crack and he requires the space equivalent of coconut oil to soothe them back from the crack. Sorry. got a bit, uh, involved.
2121 2018-03-13 20:02:57 We can live without olive oil and champagne ... after all Lambrini and Mazola are British and they're just as good!!!!

2123 2018-03-13 20:02:45 Cos Pompeo is just so pro Russia !!! Jeez Louise, at least pretend to make it look like you gave it some thought! I remember the howls of Tillerson the oil man was in bed with the Ruskies on taking the position ffs!!!
2124 2018-03-13 20:02:43 @WheatThins just had your cracked pepper and olive oil..... you had me at the first crunchy square!!!! What a delicious healthy snack!!! I will need a few more boxes SOON!!!!!
2125 2018-03-13 20:02:23 I’m here to get my oil changed and that’s it!  I can’t afford shit else now move! @jiffylube
2126 2018-03-13 20:02:23 As a result of the federal government’s failure to modernize its oil and gas lease program, U.S. taxpayers are losing out on more than $730 million in revenue every year plus the cost of clean up at many sites.
2127 2018-03-13 20:01:58 You should mention to these kids that you support an admin that wants to drill for oil and destroy most of the oceans and beaches of NC, just for transparency sake.
2128 2018-03-13 20:01:47 Sarah said,”drill baby drill” and the Libtards attacked her. Now look we are on track to be the #1 oil producer in 2 years!! Gina says, “waterboard baby waterboard!”. Of course , Libtards are crazy! Wonder how many terrorists will be exposed in two years!!!
2129 2018-03-13 20:01:45 I guess but cheese! Eek! I usually buy a bit olive oil spread in mash and syn it.
2130 2018-03-13 20:01:32 The sense of pride you get after you finally get an oil change after pushing it off for like a month is unmatchable.
2131 2018-03-13 20:01:31 I may be wrong, but that will lead to more sanctions towards Russia, putting Us on a more favourable field for selling their over priced oil or gas and make us more dependent on the usa.

2145 2018-03-13 20:00:06 Tillerson as secratary of state was supposed to oppose sanctions and make the ExxonMobil/ Rosneft ( russian) oil deal. Tillerson embraced sanctions and criticized russia.  He messed with their money and power so you get fired.
2146 2018-03-13 19:59:53 Not to much difference, the CIA/Pentagon acts in the interest of big oil by presuing polices that ensure "US companies control materials that are vital to the national security of the US" no matter were said materials are located in the world.
2147 2018-03-13 19:59:53 Seven years ago, the war started in our country. The world came together to destroy #Syria in order to protect Israel and its resources, which were stolen from our country. The war started with the money and oil of the Arab Gulf and terrorist fighters from all over the world and
2148 2018-03-13 19:59:49 I'd like to thank my sis @justsayjackiee for introducing me to oil cleansing because  MY SKIN HAS BEEN POPPIN! 
I've also only been drinking water for a month.
2149 2018-03-13 19:59:34 PUBLIC land. Not corporate oil land! Should be OUR decision. Disgraceful.
2150 2018-03-13 19:59:33 put castor oil on your brows every night before u go to bed n rinse it off in the morning or try applying olive oil + a few drops of honey on your brows (kinda massage them w the oil) n leave it on there for 20-30 minutes. you'll get growth w either method 
2151 2018-03-13 19:59:25 Tillerson's firing seems to have riled the broad market, not sure why oil would react.  Broad market reaction seems called for IMO because Pompeo, Trump's nomination for Tillerson's replacement, is an ex-CIA director AND a hawk.  Just who we DON'T need heading up the State Dept

2161 2018-03-13 19:58:50 So I wouldn't recommend @Tesco tinned sardines in sunflower oil. They are sharp
2162 2018-03-13 19:58:31 Personally I had a hard time finding evidence that olive oil is better for cooking with than refined pufa oil. Is heat stability and trans-formation secondary to some other harmful trait of pufa’s?
2163 2018-03-13 19:58:30 for my AM moisturizer, i do a clay mask to rly suck up all that nasty oil and debris stuck inside my pores.
2164 2018-03-13 19:58:26 Trump is as erratic as he is manic. Oil energy expert Tillerson was a remarkable Sec of State & the haemorrhage of seasoned career diplomats from state dept can only hit crescendo after his firing.
2165 2018-03-13 19:58:23 Am out of the equation, if you have an issue with the justice system, oil them.
2166 2018-03-13 19:57:49 That was stupid
2167 2018-03-13 19:57:12 Meghan, you are to slow to see why Tillerson was appointed. As head of ExxonMobil he opposed russia sanctions. He was brought in to make a deal with Rosneft oil. Collusion took place to block Hilary/ block sanctions and make 9trillion $ deal. Deal failed=tillerson fired.

2184 2018-03-13 19:55:26 The SNP's White Paper relied on GERS to support their fiscal plan—which they misrepresented by saying oil was a bonus when it was definitely a basis. Why, if GERS was good enough for SNP during #indyref, are you now saying that they've always been against it?

2187 2018-03-13 19:54:42 Hi John,

Tillerson's former company, Exxon Mobile, also cut their losses and killed the oil deal they had going with Russia last week (our sanctions were holding it up). This would be a reason Tillerson may have wanted to leave anyway.

2194 2018-03-13 19:53:43 Not just that, Tillerson is gone until 31 March, I believe Oil  pressure groups didn't allowed Trump to fire him like a simple apprentice. It is a precedent!
2195 2018-03-13 19:53:32 Today brings up that age old question: Which is more evil - the oil industry or the CIA?
2196 2018-03-13 19:53:21 County Tyrone: A4 Woodlough Road has been reopened following clearance of an overturned oil tanker.

2199 2018-03-13 19:53:17 Hey guys if you don't use coconut oil on the daily you should rly try it.
2200 2018-03-13 19:53:12 Hope   wakes up soon & send these US paid activists packing. US buys oil cheap then sells it back to us for billions in profits. Something wrong with this picture? Why no activists in Texas? govt a bunch of dummies? Maybe they are also on the take....

2211 2018-03-13 19:51:29 I thought Rex was in bed with Russia. Oil deal? Some medal of friendship? Why turn on Russia now?
2212 2018-03-13 19:51:18 Me & my last neighbours, the smell from their place was the straw.... They cooked with oil & garlic all day everyday. Smell was so drenched in walls it sipped through. I would be asleep at 2am & be smelling used oil & garlic . I swoped units in same complex. The freedom!
2213 2018-03-13 19:51:15 Next time someone says something about Iran's government, remind them the the United States overthrew their democracy because we didn't like the fact that they were going to nationalize their oil. The result is the government they have today.
2214 2018-03-13 19:51:08 People feeling sorry for #Tillerson?  Here: Exxon Valdez oil spill, incredible wealth, accepted a job he was unqualified for working for a fascist wannabee orange #moron,  awarded the "Friend of Russia" medal personally by Putin. Fuck him.
2215 2018-03-13 19:51:05 I can't believe Rex Tillerson got thrown off of his oil rig into shark-infested waters this government really took a turn
2216 2018-03-13 19:51:04 He hired him because Putin had once given him a medal and he has tons of oil wealth. He fired him the week that he criticized Russia for using chemical weapons on people in the UK. Seems like good reasons to me, if Trump is working for Putin.
2217 2018-03-13 19:51:04 @HomefuelsDirect @tinasullivan1 no oil turned up again! do not recommend this company! take money and don’t deliver! #homefuelsdirect #nodelivery
2218 2018-03-13 19:51:02 the former is based on the fact that Tillerson is an oil and gas man who’s done a lot of work with Russia and the later is based on the idea that he said Russia was responsible for the UK poisoning. Those are both facts and reasons Putin would like, then dislike, Rex as Secstate.
2219 2018-03-13 19:50:58 Is he? No way...reading his tweets his rasict remarks and his all round disgusting behaviour?? ...here was me thinking he was a just headbanger snake oil salesman who lies every time his lips move...ta for the headsup ..

2222 2018-03-13 19:50:21 Megan's up! "There's no question that petroleum and oil are fuel for our lives. But the U.S. already has a lot of oil." Points out that U.S. is already a net exporter of petroleum and that 2018 budget recommends we sell off nearly half of strategic reserves. #DontDrillGA

2234 2018-03-13 19:48:29 Alyssa,

It's also a week after Exxon Mobile cut their losses and cancelled their oil deal with Russia that has been held up due to sanctions. There's a lot a ways this could've played out.

2254 2018-03-13 19:47:00 I hadn't thought about it. But I guess you're right - Trump's firing of Tillerson is a slap in the face of a oil large corporation. Perhaps Trump will feel some ramifications from this. Makes sense that if Trump mishandles fire, he'll get burnt.

2261 2018-03-13 19:46:08 Our market was in crisis due to oil price for a short period, from 2015 to 2016.  Oil prices hit a solid level (+50) in 2017 so deficit spending should not have been necessary.  Much of the deficit was due to gov't program creation and expansion of public sector jobs.

2357 2018-03-13 19:34:50 Is there any specific wording regarding oil by rail volume reduction in regards to pipeline capacity? Will oil by rail volumes be reduce by the NEB as the pipeline capacity increases ? Is CN and CP on board with that? Will KM or the Feds compensate rail companies?
2358 2018-03-13 19:34:43 That's because most of the ISIS fighters do not even care about Islam, they  are just mercenaries paid dearly out of Western tax dollars to do the fighting of elite to confiscate resources and oil.

2360 2018-03-13 19:34:35 This is something which was bound to happen. Even a layperson like m could see it while Indian govt nor policy think-tanks couldn't.

2370 2018-03-13 19:33:43 Q: Is there a wave of SPAs coming? How dependent is this on oil prices?
A: Not many coming, mostly signed internationally (challenge to finance), new SPAs deals will need more constructive crude outlook..harder to finance...spot market is growing & deep
2371 2018-03-13 19:33:40 tillerson was in place to help/benefit from putin's goal of lifting sanctions on oil. now tRump has fired tillerson, made a point of saying he decided alone, and now tRump has picked someone with a stronger stance against putin. please explain. is tillerson under investigation?
2372 2018-03-13 19:33:37 Don't use any cream/ oil based ointments, they make the scaring last longer. Use callamine as a topical/drying ointments.

No? Well, I’m sure it was irrelevant anyhow...

2387 2018-03-13 19:32:01 Only the 3 left. We took the 3 jars with us. XDDDD
We approached the cave where the orcs were camping out, used mage hand to pour oil on the ground, and then chucked the jar into the cave, which is what caused the panic. They kept failing constitution saving throws.

2391 2018-03-13 19:31:25 Glad to see #rexit #tillerson was in the pocket of big oil and a enemy of the environment. But what if his replacement? Hired to take on Mueller?
2392 2018-03-13 19:31:21 Oh wow! I must have the most oily hair ever, I have to wash mine every other day or it looks like someone dunked my head in a bucket of olive oil. 
2393 2018-03-13 19:31:19 Your right it shouldn't be a wall it should be a moat with flaming oil around all you fake demos
2394 2018-03-13 19:31:19 He was that's why he was hired. He's also the ex CEO of an oil Corp! Guess being a business man just isn't enough.

2401 2018-03-13 19:30:16 Ok, I got the latest result of my head scan for tumours this morning. Doc- “Stable nothing new happening upstairs, come back for a new MRI in 3 months”. So my wife and I are doing fantastic, now I need a Oil victory tonight.
2402 2018-03-13 19:30:14 The real reason is because Exxon-Mobil is no longer doing the deal with Rosneft to drill for Russian oil.
2403 2018-03-13 19:29:54 I'm not even ready to be independent. Engine oil costs 4200. Oil change costs 2000. Wheel alignment and balancing are 4000. I might have to change a couple of shock absorbers. I hear one goes for 6000. 

TAKE ME BACK TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL!

2406 2018-03-13 19:29:23 Also better to have a hawk at the table with the DPRK instead of an oil man.
2407 2018-03-13 19:29:16 No matter what the Republicans put out about the investigation, I have a feeling the investigation committee knows something about Trump, collusion and the oil deal in the dossier. I think Republicans have something on Trump and he is not calling these shots. I could be wrong.
2408 2018-03-13 19:29:14 I got my AC fixed, an alignment, 4 new tires, an oil change, and a full tank of gas. I’d call that a successful trip home. Thanks, Dad!

2418 2018-03-13 19:28:19 One of the biggest improvements to my cooking was just learning that water droplet method to check if my stainless steel pan was hot enough -- but not too hot! -- before adding oil.
2419 2018-03-13 19:28:18 Just grateful it wasn't chip oil!

2429 2018-03-13 19:27:19 Oil industry rep speaking now. Yes, our country runs on gas & oil. But research indicates at best, deposits off GA coast would fuel domestic demand for 1 month. At worst, irreparable harm to our wildlife, fisheries, tourism, economy & quality of life. It's not worth the risk.
2430 2018-03-13 19:26:52 Trump hired Tillerson 14 months ago, you knob.  Tillerson had never been in politics before.  He was not a part of the swamp but Trump wanted him for his oil connections to Russia.

2436 2018-03-13 19:26:18 You asked for them  
I did state above that assuming zero tax take we’ll still be worse off in a post Brexit UK. The price of oil has risen and 2.8 billion more barrels have been extracted this year, safe to assume the revenues will rise this year!
2437 2018-03-13 19:26:04 If you don’t get what I’m saying your the moron. Your clearly missing the point. Tired of explaining it.  My fault, what should I expect from someone that became a fan when city became an oil club.

2455 2018-03-13 19:24:35 Apparently you're not aware that Tillerson had never been in politics until 14 months ago when Trump hired him for his Russia oil connections.  Why are you Trump fanboys so stupid?
2456 2018-03-13 19:24:33 Rex liked to tell the story of his wife telling him that God had a plan for him, that God was calling on him to do this.  Who knew God had such a sense of humor?  Turns out Trump was the former oil exec's personal Satan.

2460 2018-03-13 19:24:05 the invisible war going on underneath the North Pole. Russia, US, Norway, Canada are all going up as far as they can claiming land, Russia found an oil 'honey pot' that is said to be largest ever, but  sanctions stop them from tapping it. Rex knows that .
2461 2018-03-13 19:24:02 AND giving vicious dictator billions in oil by helping them get oil out of the ground as long as Exxon gets their money.

2479 2018-03-13 19:22:05 @maddow It seems, Since Exon reneged on Russian Oil Deal, Putin is retaliating by getting rid of Tillerson,that he had installed in the first place, as Trump is Putin's Lap-Dog, does what he's told. Trump obeys Putin's instructions to destroy the U.S. gov., / western economies

2481 2018-03-13 19:21:46 How long does it take do an oil change and rotate tires!?
2482 2018-03-13 19:21:40 Tillerson was holding on thinking he could still get that Arctic Oil deal with Russia through at some point.
2483 2018-03-13 19:21:37 Do you realize that a few months ago you'll all said he's a rich oil man he don't know anything! Now he's your Hero cause he said Russia is bad? Give it a rest, seriously Handler and you must do the same pills!
2484 2018-03-13 19:21:36 Trading an oil magnate for another guy with no diplomatic experience solves exactly nothing. It'll probably be fine not to have a functioning state department while preparing for talks with North Korea, right?
2485 2018-03-13 19:21:34 1. He sided with U.K. over  attack & said  has only gotten bolder in attacks 2. Exxon pulled out of  oil deal 3. Pompeo secretly met w/ 3 top  spy heads which we had to learn from RT 4. Tillerson NO on NK ( like a Kremlin op) 5. DT fires him replaces w Pompeo

2498 2018-03-13 19:20:31 Apparently growing food, bring up oil, manufacturing all the things we rely on, mining coal, all this, which occurs in red America, is ‘looking backward.’

2509 2018-03-13 19:19:15 Wait, Maine has oil? #mainehasoil
2510 2018-03-13 19:19:15 He's probably thinking "Thank god I don't have to take orders from that psychotic imbecile anymore! Now I can go back to lying to the world about the damage my oil cronies and I are doing to the environment! Oh joyous day!"
2511 2018-03-13 19:19:13 They would have it that expenditures that the PC govts made in tourism, high tech, marine industries, advanced edu, health, poverty reduction, tax relief etc etc was "squandered" oil money.
2512 2018-03-13 19:19:09 saw a menu shorten extra virgin olive oil to XVOO, which is what vince mcmahon would use if he had a cooking show

2517 2018-03-13 19:19:00 It's also equivalent to Australia's. Lets drop the oil price about $10 a barrel for shits and giggles they'll be bankrupt In 12 months.

2519 2018-03-13 19:18:52 IF a black woman did that to a white woman???? Come on folks. Send her to a spa with essential oil therapy. Calm her white ass down.
2520 2018-03-13 19:18:47 Rex fixed our oil troubles now Mike will attack cyber great move!
2521 2018-03-13 19:18:43 And now we know why he put up with the humiliation of being a Trump lackey: there was always a big pay off even if he didn't manage to get the Arctic oil deal with Putin. He'll be back with Exxon in less than a month, likely.
2522 2018-03-13 19:18:41 i got rosehip oil im shaking for troye

2535 2018-03-13 19:16:46 This is amazing that people are taking up for an oil tycoon.

Yes he's right, @realDonaldTrump  is a moron, but I'm not all the sudden a fan of tillerson and congratulating the guy...that oil rich CEO should have never had that position in the first place!!
2536 2018-03-13 19:16:29 He couldn't accomplish his one purpose, to lift Russia sanctions so Exxon could move forward with its $1 trillion oil/gas deal. Does Rex need to give back the $180 million Exxon gave him when took the SoS gig?

2545 2018-03-13 19:14:42 Probably more hype about my essential oil diffuser than I should be 
2546 2018-03-13 19:14:39 Here is the thing... before accepting SoS, he may have been the most important man in the oil industry. He was probably making $50M a year, and now he is soooo diminished.  He looks so weak and like a stooge.   He is the poster boy for why you stay away from Trump.
2547 2018-03-13 19:14:38 Ahh, so it's now 'bitumen'? That's fair. 'Oil' was a marketing euphemism developed in the seventies to disguise it's true nature. Which is tar-like.
2548 2018-03-13 19:14:37 Exactly, I deplored the man...his role didn’t play out due to oil sanctions
2549 2018-03-13 19:14:37 Cut in half, either way, then roast w salt, pepper, garlic powder, and olive oil for 40 min
2550 2018-03-13 19:14:34 Will he go back to Exxon? Will he stay with Big Oil? What's his next move, I wonder.

2554 2018-03-13 19:13:45 He's  a buck stops with  me guy... His agenda was oil.. Putin hand picked him.. He gutted the dept, didnt spend a dime allotted to safeguard against russian meddling. And he knew full well what trumps all about
2555 2018-03-13 19:13:19 The snp also wasted the billions of oil money on garlic road signs. Walloper.
2556 2018-03-13 19:13:10 In fairness to @realDonaldTrump, the whole point of hiring Rex Tillerson was to get huge oil deals made in Russia for Trump's daddy Putin, which he failed to do. That's not the job of the Secretary of State, but that's not the job Trump actually wanted done.
2557 2018-03-13 19:13:07 Here we go with @realDonaldTrump  and his loyalty pledges.... tillerson probably couldn't stand his ass anyways...time for him to go back to being a greedy oil tycoon..oh well, so sad too bad. Waiting for his next apprentice to get fired or leave the show...
2558 2018-03-13 19:12:52 Yup - those young men dropped out of high school for big oil money. They never planned for the future. They have no education, no other job skills. Your article even states that. 
This government is offering programs so they CAN be educated, so they CAN learn other skills.
2559 2018-03-13 19:12:41 @djlegacy Sounds like a plan! Did you get an oil change yet?
2560 2018-03-13 19:12:32 So happy my mom paying for my oil change cause I sure wasn’t gon get it

2563 2018-03-13 19:11:42 Looks like the Washington D.C. branch of the Kremlin came out with another head scratching firing today. While I typically don't feel empathy for oil execs, its bush league to fire your Sec. of State. до свида́нья Rex.

2566 2018-03-13 19:11:17 He didn't deserve the job in the FIRST PLACE, only experience is being in bed with oil producing countries for Exxon and the other oil companies.  Was in it for the money that could be made on the back end just like @realdonaldtrump @flotus @vp @ivankatrump
2567 2018-03-13 19:11:08 Everybody's all up in arms about Tillerson being fired like he wasn't some oligarch billionaire oil executive with zero experience with diplomacy or policy, who received a Russian Order of Friendship medal from Vladimir Putin...
2568 2018-03-13 19:11:04 Bowser is more superior then Tillerson. He got the star rod once. Rex...well he's just an Oil whore.
2569 2018-03-13 19:10:57 Shock and awe but great move Tex got the oil job done Mike can attack cyber!
2570 2018-03-13 19:10:57 “This administration is a well run oiled machine”, the oil is all over the con man/traitor’s fat ass for Putin’s access.
2571 2018-03-13 19:10:57 Why is Putin pretending NOT to speak English? We all know he speaks English.. Rex-T what working on the oil pipe line with put in's help.
2572 2018-03-13 19:10:57 it'd be really funny if Tillerson becomes and oil & gas lobbyist and represents Russian companies
2573 2018-03-13 19:10:48 The world already has too many Trumps. We need Trudeau to stand against them and the oil companies.

2583 2018-03-13 19:10:17 Chaos serves Putin. Putin is in with Kim Jong Un. Delivers oil. Against all sanctions. Trump silent on this. NK is working with Russia. Trump isn't worried. He's with Putin too. They could work things out but we'd lose democracy. We'd be an extension of Russia.

No, being a CEO for Big Oil was disqualifying and disagreeing with Trump was the *redeeming* feature.

2595 2018-03-13 19:09:21 Trump, you are an absolute coward with not a bone of integrity in your entire pudgy body.  Tillerson, a big corporate Oil man, was more of a patriot with a firm grasp on foreign policy than you ever could be. Good luck to Pompeo. Is he the boot licking toady you're looking for?

2597 2018-03-13 19:09:11 Weaker dollar would spur higher import prices on mfg goods and oil, while also inducing food shortages as producers would have to export proportionally more product to maintain incomes.

2602 2018-03-13 19:08:48 i mean, we use non-dairy stuff that turns to gross oil if it's left out in the warm months, so....
2603 2018-03-13 19:08:44 Because the West promisezed that NATO would not moved an inch toward east.
The West betrayed that promisezed.
Because the USA and Saudia Arabia made collapse the oil prize in order to crash the russian economy.Because the USA orchestraeted a coup in Ukraine.
Enough?

2611 2018-03-13 19:08:09 "Rex Tillerson"  One wonders if Mueller knows something about the oil deal in the dossier and the administration is getting ahead of this, especially given that Pompeo is the choice to replace him. Could Trump not be running the show anymore under the threat of exposure?

2628 2018-03-13 19:06:49 I don’t think he ever wanted to be associated with Drumph all that much. He was hoping to get sanctions against Russia lifted so his Exxon buds (& himself) could complete the failed deal for access to the East-Prinovozemelsky field — 36 million barrels of oil — and other areas.

2630 2018-03-13 19:06:43 If Tillerson has any patriotism at all he will expose Trumps con. I suspect that Tillerson got what he wanted protecting the ExxonMobil Rosneft 500 billion dollar oil deal in Russia. In America money is the bane of all responsibilities.
2631 2018-03-13 19:06:24 Well he won it twice with barca without oil money.

Wat abt mou? Despite all the russia money in chelsea n the open cheque from perez in madrid, did he win the UCL? 
Hypocrisy at its best.
2632 2018-03-13 19:06:22 Like middle east identified with oil exports; India must be identified with value added processed food exports! (11/11)
2633 2018-03-13 19:06:21 Alas, Tillerson is probably in it up to his neck, self-incrimination doesn't seem his style. CEOs care about the shareholders, not the staff/ work force/ or general public aside from their willingness to buy. Since oil isn't rationed, Tillerson gets to retire in comfort w/o qualm

2635 2018-03-13 19:06:13 What Essential Oil do you have to diffuse to get that result?
2636 2018-03-13 19:06:11 He gets no pass from me. Firstly, just for working for the #Moron and secondly, he was the one licking his lips at making oil deals with Putin. He’s dirty and if we ever get our country back I hope he is held accountable.
2637 2018-03-13 19:06:04 Well the PCs should have thought of that, instead of letting hospitals, schools, and roads deteriorate when oil was $100/barrel. 
Businesses are expanding. You have to have infrastructure to support those businesses. Those businesses don't want to come to provinces where there
2638 2018-03-13 19:06:03 how is he establishment? he came from the oil industry??
2639 2018-03-13 19:06:03 Like the middle east identified with oil exports, the comparative advantage of India is in its becoming value added exporter of processed foods. (9/11)
2640 2018-03-13 19:06:01 Tillerson got the oil job done now Pompeo will tackle cyber great freaking move!

2646 2018-03-13 19:05:39 I could smell like body wash right now, or Herbalism, or Charity Pot, or jojoba oil w/ tea tree scent, or coconut oil w/ lavender scent, but no; I was disinfecting gardening tools earlier so obviously today’s scent is gonna stay straight up bleach
2647 2018-03-13 19:05:34 She voted for the Iraq war, she supported disastrous regimes in central and south america. She supported Libyan intervention. Syrian. She constantly antagonized Iran. She wouldn't have taken an oil CEO as secretary, but the effective difference would have been minimal.

2649 2018-03-13 19:05:23 What was wrong with the seventies great fun. The economic problems were largely due to the “oil crisis” 1973 which caused inflation and understandably industrial unrest
2650 2018-03-13 19:05:13 Would you rather have Oil consumption or A variable displacement compressor for efficiently cooling and lubricating seals arranged on a rotary shaft?
2651 2018-03-13 19:05:11 That shit would make me so mad when I would review portfolios of students and hear other ppl talk down because they were using whatever they had access to. Sorry a fuckin 16 year old can’t drop 100s of dollars on oil paint, let them apple barrel that 2 dollar canvas the fuck up.
2652 2018-03-13 19:05:06 Tillerson the oil guy got it done great job!  Pompeo a cyber guy great freaking move!
2653 2018-03-13 19:04:55 Keep after them... the squeaky wheel gets the oil..
2654 2018-03-13 19:04:39 Except there's the oil industry issue.

2657 2018-03-13 19:03:52 You have no idea what International rules and regulations are made for!! You don’t have to remove DP World by force otherwise UAE would have not existed as sovereign oil rich countries with Russia and USA capabilities to capture UAE in few hours with power!

2660 2018-03-13 19:03:45 As I did when I was 7 years old, I am currently running a mouse hospital for the mice that have been trapped in glue traps by my landlord :’( if you use veggie oil and then wash em off with dawn dish soap they’ll be ok (I have them incubating in a tank as they can get hypothermia
2661 2018-03-13 19:03:44 So you're saying that a hugely successful, impossibly wealthy oil exec who just ran the entire US State Department should get on TV and start ranting like Maxine Waters? Are you expecting any pussy hats to appear? Maybe a shout of "Resist!"?
2662 2018-03-13 19:03:14 I think Tillerson's new book should be titled "From Oil To Crude (A Gas of a Journey)"  @HamillHimself @SethMacFarlane
2663 2018-03-13 19:03:04 It makes for a pseudo-clever "gotcha", but it's pretty easy to see the two are not contradictory. They hired an oil exec who was awarded Russian Order of Friendship (any rational person would find this suspect) and fired him after he was privately & publicly critical of Russia.
2664 2018-03-13 19:03:04 Why Pompeo?  Surely there's another oil executive to grudgingly take the job...
2665 2018-03-13 19:03:03 Yes of course that'll fix things: another death.
2666 2018-03-13 19:02:46 Are they going solar as some people seem to think BC no longer needs fuel from AB?  (ie crazy people blocking the pipeline from oil BC desperately needs)

2670 2018-03-13 19:02:31 And it is possible Russia and Iran and Saudi will have a role in setting or the ability to set that price via oil...
2671 2018-03-13 19:02:15 That's enough sports news for me today. If you need me I'll be not reading about Amendola's departure to Miami. Ask me about North Dakota's oil production for January, though. I'm your gal.
2672 2018-03-13 19:02:11 Don’t feel sorry for him, he did his job! He will come back to Texas and continue his oil career!
2673 2018-03-13 19:02:04 Great ! Problem is the NDP have taxed the oil/gas industry into the ground and with weak federal pipeline support, this announcement is irrelevant....the NDP/liberals have destroyed this industry  @jkenney @OilGasCanada @oilrespect @PipelineAction #NEP2 #Calgary #Alberta

2678 2018-03-13 19:01:36 Tillerson has been working with career people in the State Dept who are dedicated to promoting the interests of the country, a big shift from leading a company with an interest in exploiting Russian oil!

2684 2018-03-13 19:01:10 Why is it called “fish oil”?
2685 2018-03-13 19:01:08 India commits to 'Sugar and Oil' cooperation... Oil? India? ...how they get in this?
2686 2018-03-13 19:01:05 Asking state to be responsible when fixing rates is abit asking for too much esp.considering the collapsed oil revenue and endless electoral promises.what of citizen failure to contribute to debates during bill passage
2687 2018-03-13 19:01:04 Zinke wants off shore oil drilling, of course, FL is exempt. If my state has oil rigs off shore then so should FL. Every state values their coastlines just as much, no one wants to run the risk of oil spills. I’m sure Mar-a-largo has nothing to do with final decision
2688 2018-03-13 19:00:59 wow.. guess i was dropped in cooking oil when i was small so that's why im burnt
2689 2018-03-13 19:00:59 rex being fired is kind of a big deal. #oil
2690 2018-03-13 19:00:48 Gotta be T-Nels, he is in impeccable shape and if Bob reaches for and arm bar he will slide right off from the baby oil. My only concern is that T keeps focused and on task...
2691 2018-03-13 19:00:47 I don’t like anyone hitting the block or crossing the centerline, but if you believe that any racer is trying to mow down a block or cross over and most is in their control (especially with this pic) then we are at different races. Furthermore oil down rule applied to this run
2692 2018-03-13 19:00:43 To a degree sure but to be perfectly honest, my guess is Chiarelli would've built this Oilers team in a similar fashion....regardless of whether or not the Manning play had ever happened.
2693 2018-03-13 19:00:36 OIL DIFF: 4.02 -> 4.06
2694 2018-03-13 19:00:27 Rex can now return with Putin to the Arctic drilling for oil knowing Trump and the US have no sanctions to worry about. Good job and thank you says Putin.
2695 2018-03-13 19:00:26 How strange is it that in today's news cycle, the hero of the left and any trump hater is an evil oil executive they rarely supported to begin with? But hey, only in Trump's inner circle of "only the best people" can you get fired by Twitter... #TillersonTuesday

2705 2018-03-13 18:59:56 There wasn't much 'Policy' to start with Bernie, but here's a real question "How is His firing going to effect Tillersons arctic oil drilling deal he has been working on with Putin since before being SoS?"
2706 2018-03-13 18:59:54 NNPC should stop been political..  These refineries are meant to work in 2016 why extending it to 2019..?? I can't imagine this that a country as big as Nigeria who solely depend on crude oil don't have a working refinery.. #shame @NNPCgroup @AsoRock
2707 2018-03-13 18:59:52 Tillerson sold his soul for oil and tax cuts. He was not a traitor, however.

2712 2018-03-13 18:59:25 Need to be careful what we wish for. If Iran can't sell oil they will store it. Then when the sanctions are lifted they can flood the market and the price will plummet. Sound familiar?
2713 2018-03-13 18:59:22 Mineral oil submersion is just a fucker to troubleshoot
2714 2018-03-13 18:59:00 Of course Rex Tillerson was let go. Oil execs are terrible at controlling catastrophes they helped create

2718 2018-03-13 18:58:41 It is not in the US’s best interest to allow Canada to become a competitor. It is however in there best interest to consider the oil sands their private reserve, with them being Canada’s only customer.

When my stock is going slow it gives me time to workout more so that's a +
2723 2018-03-13 18:58:28 Levy additional taxes on leases extracting oil and gas that gets exported to China and other foreign countries at the EXPENSE of our environment! Especially since many of these corporations ARE NOT EVEN AMERICAN! #CorruptGOP #CoryCash #RussianSanctions
2724 2018-03-13 18:58:21 Wait a minute. This is a 2014 document that was predicting oil prices for 2016-2017. We’re past the guessing stage, mate, it’s 2018 now .

Did you even read the thing? Look at the gulf in our fiscal deficit. It is huge. Absolutely huge. Did you even read it? 
2725 2018-03-13 18:58:14 Are you on the oil truck
2726 2018-03-13 18:58:07 At which time Rex Tillerson will turn back into a barrel of oil.
2727 2018-03-13 18:58:06 Tillerson sold his reputation (either you liked him or not I bet he was respected bc he was the man in charge at Exxon) for a few extra bucks that never came (sanctions, oil deal) now he’ll live in the history books as a joke, SAD!

2735 2018-03-13 18:56:54 I think we should just pay $5 less per barrel of oil we get from Mexico for a few years. This article says it would help pay for itself by preventing more people from coming here, getting forms of welfare & racking up medical bills.

2748 2018-03-13 18:54:09 Don’t forget that on 3/1/18 the company he formerly led, Exxon, pulled out of its deal with Russia to extract Arctic oil. Reason? Sanctions. Putin couldn’t have been happy.
2749 2018-03-13 18:54:01 Pretty bad when the president fires an oil company executive for not being evil enough.

2752 2018-03-13 18:53:34 Watching #RexTillerson - one thing is clear - their relationship was doomed from the start. They’re like oil & water. Tillerson: disciplined, measured, calm & dignified in his public comments. Trump: not so much. Reminder: you can catch more flies w honey, than vinegar.
2753 2018-03-13 18:53:32 ExxonMobil and Rosneft  oil company( 3rd largest company in Russia ) had difficulty completing a deal due to sanctions imposed by President Obama. Trump tried to lift sanctions ( COLLUSION ) in exchange for Hillary's sabotage but also to complete the deal. Failed/tillerson fired.

2755 2018-03-13 18:53:29 The prob is they have us over a barrel regarding their oil and gas,,and they know it mate,,c,mon look at our reaction to the last time they done this in the uk with that guy called Litvineko (something like that) their economy is shite so give them more heavier sanctions baz

2771 2018-03-13 18:52:25 What was the story about Exxon & Chad, where Tillerson has just dared to show his face? Chad's dictator has oil. Apparently the people don't. It wasn't supposed to be that way. @maddow revealed the skulduggery some time ago.
2772 2018-03-13 18:52:19 Oil ya scalp, ya braids before you get the bob and treat ya hair with a deep conditioner and leave in conditioner..
2773 2018-03-13 18:52:08 I think Tillerson always thought he was doing the right thing....even when he disagreed with POTUS.  It was an oil and water relationship from the time he was confirmed.
2774 2018-03-13 18:52:08 Really poor service from @Boilerjuice - left us in the lurch with no oil and a “promise” to get some to us by Fri, which would be a week after our scheduled delivery. Not happy.
2775 2018-03-13 18:51:55 Employees are hired only if they pass a drug screening, often times done by a lab, and are tested if there is any sort of incedent. Some oil and gas companies in Alberta do random tests for no reason at all. 2/
2776 2018-03-13 18:51:51 Naw i went to go get my oil changed
2777 2018-03-13 18:51:48 Here is your daily reminder that Holland and Barrett CBD oil is as much use as a chocolate fire guard 
2778 2018-03-13 18:51:43 Try excedrin tension relief and peppermint essential oil on your temples! It helps when I get them!
2779 2018-03-13 18:51:37 Oooh... Now I want a half-dozen!
We had Chinese Crested dogs when I was a kid. I couldn't stop petting them. We had to sunscreen them whenever they went outside. One older dog had chronic dry skin & needed baby oil massages every day. It was like buttering a warm jacket potato.
2780 2018-03-13 18:51:31 He isn’t worried about leaking oil washing up in Anderson. He can profit from the energy lobbyists and sacrifice the coast.
2781 2018-03-13 18:51:30 His failed attempt to make a $500B oil deal went south.
2782 2018-03-13 18:51:25 If you're claiming you're going to kill the children of terrorist and take the oil from the middle east you did not run an anti-neocon campaign. Neocon is simply a buzzword to most ppl. The only ppl who didn't think he was an aggressive war-hawk were journalist. No one else.
2783 2018-03-13 18:51:24 Oye, Estás bien bonita de tu cara!
2784 2018-03-13 18:51:20 get a good beard oil, it can help with growth!!! :)
2785 2018-03-13 18:51:16 Using baby oil when shaving is a fucking god sent I’m sooooo smooth
2786 2018-03-13 18:51:10 "Ve are going to SMASH ze oil companies! Zen blow them away with a bazooka! Lastly, I'll suplex the CEO of Chevron into a pancake!

Then I'll turn to the camera, take the cigar out of my mouth and say 'you couldn't GREASE your way past this one'."  #BICEP
2787 2018-03-13 18:50:49 Intellectually bankrupt snake oil salesman @larry_kudlow would fit right in The Swamp. How about nominate someone who completed their economics degree for NEC?
2788 2018-03-13 18:50:48 Again you ignore why?
Why would they spend on scots WITH NO RETURN?
Yoons cant explain that without mentioning oil and gas
2789 2018-03-13 18:50:45 Michigan will be easy to defend. We'll dig a trench between us and Ohio, fill it will oil, and light it up. Mackinac Island can be our last resort fall back position.
2790 2018-03-13 18:50:10 One time I was taken to the ER with doctor ready to perform emergency surgery for appendicitis and my dad comes barging in with coconut oil and herbal medicines and massaged my belly and then I farted and fell asleep.
2791 2018-03-13 18:50:06 ... claim on land that is not even theirs anymore, like literally the property is owned by someone else. There is also a big oil refinery around here and people endlessly bitch about them despite the fact they are the only thing holding up the economy of New Brunswick.
2792 2018-03-13 18:50:00  Key point: Rex fallout b/c of Trump’s exercrable treatment of a man Big Oil likes.
2793 2018-03-13 18:49:57 Drugs and alcohol are not prevelent in camps now days. That is absulutly untrue. Like any industry,  be it restaurant to wall street, drugs and alcohol are there.  The big difference is the oil and gas idustry does drug testing. Alcohol you can smell. 1/
2794 2018-03-13 18:49:55 Congratz  super race btw. Unfortunate ending, but why let such a short moment ruin a lasting impression right 
2795 2018-03-13 18:49:50 Maybe we should build more oil pipelines and get all that oil off the tracks. That will solve the grain backlog as more trains will become available to haul grain as opposed to hauling oil. Plus, public and environmental safety will be greatly approved upon using pipelines.
2796 2018-03-13 18:49:50 Ran out of coconut oil 3 days ago and my life has been falling apart ever since
2797 2018-03-13 18:49:42 You want scots to stay in union with those who near bankrupted an oil rich UK,,then ignore our votes and attack the devolution agreement?
And you have the hard neck to call nats mad cos they can see what you fools apparently cant
I just spelt it out for yoon
2798 2018-03-13 18:49:39 Your party polotics is most the problem! Your party caters to the BIG OIL companies "koch brothers" and left Albertans crying poor!
2799 2018-03-13 18:49:36 Solar is by far the cheapest at the moment and wind is also getting cheaper. Coal is done and on its way out. Even the big oil companies are now buying into renewables, they see the writing g on the wall. Derv is just going to get more and more expensive
2800 2018-03-13 18:49:33 Who doesn't get their emu oil from amazon? 
2801 2018-03-13 18:49:18 Thoughts on using Masons Dog Oil for diabetic retinopathy and arthritis??One lady swears by it she now has full use of her fine motor skills, after her hands were knotted up. Takes around 6 weeks to see improvement. What do people think about this??
2802 2018-03-13 18:49:14 Because it's where his rich boss takes his vacations? Wouldn't want to sully the rich with unsightly and hazardous oil production.
2803 2018-03-13 18:49:08 I started cooking my salmon in Coconut Oil and it’s the best thing I’ve ever tasted in my life
2804 2018-03-13 18:48:59 On the positive side, he is 15M richer by selling his Exxon stock last year when he joined the admin. Oil stocks not doing too good
2805 2018-03-13 18:48:46 Who said a nigga couldn’t control oil and gas 
2806 2018-03-13 18:48:36 Brusecca with plenty of olive oil chilled glass of prosecco
2807 2018-03-13 18:48:29 Shit. Bout to get a oil change. How we look’n
2808 2018-03-13 18:48:21 So now Koch industries have their man in the White House. Next stop: Asian Spring, a la MidEast: turmoil, military interdiction, oil concessions. 
And finally..
Tada: All hail the new American Empire!
2809 2018-03-13 18:48:19 Okay twitter do your thing. I need a sunscreen for my face that won’t make me breakout or look like an oil slick.
2810 2018-03-13 18:48:18 He probably won’t. Chances are high they have dirt on him from his oil days.
2811 2018-03-13 18:48:08 BMOOOOT try johnson's baby oil
2812 2018-03-13 18:47:57 We go from the oil billionaires to the Koch brothers ... Drain the swamp #DrainTheSwamp. 
2813 2018-03-13 18:47:52 @Kicillofok los obreros de la empresa Oil estamos desesperados, estamos por quedar en la calle por un capricho del gobierno. La desesperacion nos llevo a cortar rutas, algo a lo que no estamos preparados...nosotros sabemos solo trabajar. Gracias Axel...vamos a volver!!!!
2814 2018-03-13 18:47:39 พี่เตทันเรื่องนั้นด้วยหลอ  ล้อเล่นน้าาา
2815 2018-03-13 18:47:35 I never tried to put it in a time period. Think the introduction of magic into a culture fundamentally changes machines and cities. Why drill for oil if you can get power from magic?
2816 2018-03-13 18:47:34 So du denkst du wärst morgen distrack! erste line: milk + oil = Gift minus Unge = Genizbarrr!
2817 2018-03-13 18:47:19 Area Oil Tycoon Grateful for Internship at White House
2818 2018-03-13 18:47:13 That is the Trump effect he has the ability to make you feel sympathy for an oil executive.
2819 2018-03-13 18:47:07 Separate question: you can or cannot use spray paint to change the color of your car? Should it be oil based paint? I have an uncle who is a painter but he’s convinced it’s not the same kind of painting. Thanks! #paint #art #artistsontwitter
2820 2018-03-13 18:47:03 I think Tillerson is going back to Exxon to finish the Rosneft oil deal. Putin knows what he is doing! This is another shiny object!!  @MSNBC @KatyTurNBC
2821 2018-03-13 18:47:03 Even Rex Tillerson, the former head of the world's most monstrous oil company, turned out to be too sane for Donald Trump's liking #endoil #endTrump
2822 2018-03-13 18:46:51 Eish babe, all I can say is stay away from stick foundations! Try the NYX Stay Matte not Flat/Clinique Stay Matte Oil Free/ just any mousse make-up. If you do happen to oil up, blot down the oil with tissue first, then apply powder. If you apply powder to oil, it will look cakey
2823 2018-03-13 18:46:49 So loving oil = hating the environment? I beg to differ.
2824 2018-03-13 18:46:49 So I just found out that my oil change is 70$ tf
2825 2018-03-13 18:46:49 非常非常喜歡
2826 2018-03-13 18:46:40 @BuzzFeedNews never needed the job, just served his country...
2827 2018-03-13 18:46:36 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
2828 2018-03-13 18:46:30 Strange because he was hired as part of trumps plan to allow putin into the WH. Tillerson has been involved with Russia, oil and putin for decades.
2829 2018-03-13 18:46:24 once behind the curtain at the voting booth, you can vote, anonymously, for anyone you want..
2830 2018-03-13 18:46:22 Don’t know what the oil companies are going to do - they’re still using the 0.1p coin on forecourts.
2831 2018-03-13 18:46:15 @SecretaryZinke Selling off public lands for your buds in oil business. Wasting taxpayer $ for personal quirks, special flag, face on coin.
Public lands n the animals on them don't come back. Zinke=Corruption 
You are a greedy, selfish man. RESIGN
2832 2018-03-13 18:46:14 You could pour coconut oil on our economy and we’d be fine

2834 2018-03-13 18:46:12 It's cool how the evil oil tycoon was the only one actually trying to do his job and now he's been fired.  I'm sure the guy who ran our torture agency will be super popular abroad.
2835 2018-03-13 18:45:51 *cough cough same with these skin care lines with just coconut oil & lemon juice*
2836 2018-03-13 18:45:33 They are not Babus. Rex The managed multi billion $ oil empire. Well paid.
2837 2018-03-13 18:45:32 I keep reading about how "Data is the new oil," but I just poured some data into my rusty Tin Man and he's still stuck. I'm not even half way to fucking Oz!!!
2838 2018-03-13 18:45:32 Not just E.Coli and Salmonella... Making #MustardOil your #CookingOil can prevent a host of other infections, irritants and inflammations because of the intrinsic healing, soothing and anti-inflammatory properties that #Mustard Oil offers.
2839 2018-03-13 18:45:29 "Attention Rex Tillerson fans, to your left you will notice a man being chased by night secretary, Lucas. This young man will be caught, deep fried in a vat of hot oil and served to our first hundred MAGAers." - DJT
2840 2018-03-13 18:45:26 My feeling is that they know this and that is the reason for the slashing and burning, wanton obvious bold faced corruption.  They are setting the oil fields afire as they retreat, leaving our country smoldering scorched earth.  They are the Saddam Husseins of America.
2841 2018-03-13 18:45:19 replacing the bumbling oil man with an unironic deus vult guy, and replacing the deus vult guy with a literal torturer
2842 2018-03-13 18:45:17 My salad with oil and vinegar is looking very forlorn right about now.
2843 2018-03-13 18:45:07 Why baffled? #Trumpov and cronies are looking for any excuse to attack #Iran for a regime change. Looting Iran’s wealth of oil and gas is the main purpose though. Why do you think #Pompeo has been promoted?
2844 2018-03-13 18:45:02 The woman used oil with CBD AND THC. You need THC to kill cancer cells. Holland and Barrett sell what is essentially a carrier oil with trace amounts of CBD. It is not the same, please be aware of this.
2845 2018-03-13 18:44:54 Cool. Oil light’s good for now, but I suspect I’ll see it soon, as I’m about 3000 miles overdue for a change. 
2846 2018-03-13 18:44:49 At the end of the day I have NO sympathy for Tillerson, I am sure his personal agenda was to get to the oil in Russia for EXXON Profits! remember he cut 30% jobs from his department LOST jobs! #resistance #Bluewave2018 #EndCitizensUnited #NoWall #singlepayerhealthcare

2849 2018-03-13 18:44:12 Bitch we bouta drown ina gallon of oil
2850 2018-03-13 18:44:09 Yeah gotta lose your Texas card for that...lifetime ban from drilling oil.
2851 2018-03-13 18:43:54 I never though oil baron Tex Richman could earn a shred of my sympathy, but Rex seemed to be the only fucktard in the entire administration who was actually trying to DO his job.
2852 2018-03-13 18:43:52 The left is grasping at Canola oil & vegetable shortening soaked straws. They do this while there's someone in the room lighting road flares & dropping them on the floor disregarding the flammable oils. Their narratives are gone.
2853 2018-03-13 18:43:48 Works for check Oil light as well
2854 2018-03-13 18:43:44 Still need an oil change.
2855 2018-03-13 18:43:41 Karak no needs of provincial fund only oil and gas royalty is too much for the development and independencey of karak.. Bcs royalty is not in millions but it's in billions..@ImranKhanPTI
2856 2018-03-13 18:43:41 Didn't George W Bush ran a oil company before becoming president so he must of been a odd choice as well...not to mention most of Trumps Whitehouse are odd choices Evanka, Jared they have no political backgrounds either and hold on Donald Trump himself no political background odd
2857 2018-03-13 18:43:36 Firing of Mr. Tillerson remind me story, when 45 years ago, I was getting my car oil changed in Michigan, two boys at the garage had an altercation, the owner told one of the boys you are fired, when the fired cried, the owner said OK you stay and now U fired
2858 2018-03-13 18:43:36 Currently getting an oil change at Valvoline.. all the employees are bullshitting about their March madness brackets and the NFL free agency moves. I’m basically in a Twitter news feed and I love it.
2859 2018-03-13 18:43:34 Seeing beyond poverty,
You may born in poor condition but doesn't mean you will die there,
Poverty is a spirit that pass through from one generation to another ,
No anointed man of God can take you out of poverty,
No amount of anointing oil can heal you from poverty .

2866 2018-03-13 18:42:42 The crisis actor Hogg is at it again,  wants to put up bullet proof glass in schools instead of arming teachers. Is this young man a quart low on an oil change or what?
2867 2018-03-13 18:42:39 Danas sam video da se ljudi podsmevaju bezviznom aranžmanu i direktnom letu do Irana. To je baš jadno.

Iran je sada jedno od najvećih on- i off-shore oil&gas gradilišta na svetu. Zbog političke situacije (skoro nemoguća saradnja sa EU/USA) ovo je velika prilika za ljude iz SRB
2868 2018-03-13 18:42:10 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
2869 2018-03-13 18:42:10 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2870 2018-03-13 18:42:09 That's what you get when you sell out for Russian oil money..what you deserve. Eventually.

2874 2018-03-13 18:41:51 When are you touring all the oil refineries? Oh wait ... @JustinTrudeau @AndrewScheer @fordnation PS. I’m not fooled by the wind and solar
2875 2018-03-13 18:41:40 Sari groceries mai lay k ate hun. I change even the oil in my babas car, kabi kabi I even fill his car tank for him.

2876 2018-03-13 18:41:40 Tillerson was in bed with Russian oil business. Had to go for that and other obvious reasons.
2877 2018-03-13 18:41:35 35% of our oil/gas is from Russia via EU
2878 2018-03-13 18:41:30 Motor oil in my beard. WTF

2880 2018-03-13 18:41:22 Rex Tillerson is gonna come to the mic and get roaster for having a bit of crude oil in the corner of his mouth
2881 2018-03-13 18:41:06 Rex was in place to help remove sanctions so Exxon could work with Russia and develop their oil industry. Sanctions put in place by Obama stopped that, so Rex attempted to do Secretary of State business but really he was only dismantling it. No one liked him
2882 2018-03-13 18:41:04 Shouldnmt the EPA do something about this? Oh wait. That’s owned by big oil.
2883 2018-03-13 18:40:58 Wasn't the Left up in arms about an Oil Man with Russian connections becoming Secretary of State, now they're all crying because #Tillerson was just the finest man to ever walk the face of the earth!
2884 2018-03-13 18:40:51 I never liked having an oil lifer in this role.
2885 2018-03-13 18:40:46 Thank goodness he can go back to his job of stealing as much money from the US economy through oil gouging.
2886 2018-03-13 18:40:36 I always smile at men who screw me over and quietly take revenge Never been a 'fire and fury' talker myself..
But that's just me. I'm sure the oil business was polite and genteel for Rex.

2891 2018-03-13 18:39:53 I am wondering what Little Britain can do against the Russians? We rely on them for oil & gas, they can do us more damage -not to mention have that buffoon #BorisJohnson as foreign sec #Madness
2892 2018-03-13 18:39:45 Globalist. He practically admits it...”a free and open society?” Sounds like a nod to Soros to me. Don’t fall for the act, the platitudes.
2893 2018-03-13 18:39:29 With tensions MUCH higher than the media admits, in the Middle East, mainly Syria, it makes sense to have someone with more experience to run the State Department. An oil exec such as Tillerson has dealt with world leaders on the business side. Not so much with military & peace.

2896 2018-03-13 18:39:10 All I want in a relationship is a loyal man who will pump my gas, get my oil changed, and take out the trash. Everything else I can do myself.
2897 2018-03-13 18:39:08 3 gallons of a 42 gallon barrel is used to make energy. So no, solar panels to create power won’t stop the demand for oil, at most the demand will decrease by 6%. I’m all for the environment, but tankers and trucks are by far way worse for it.
2898 2018-03-13 18:39:08 @JustinTrudeau what do you think of when you think of Canadian Oil? Why do I feel like your real, unscripted answer would be not so nice?
2899 2018-03-13 18:39:06 Start pumping that oil!!!
2900 2018-03-13 18:39:02 I know. And I’m sitting at the dealer thinking how cool it would be if you could do my oil change. #carcare #mom #twincities @TCAutoShow #cars #carservice #Customers

2902 2018-03-13 18:38:48 Seriously you all are bonkers. He and Rex haven’t been on the same page in awhile. What happened to you guys calling for Rex’s head because he’s a oil monger. You guys flip flop more than a fish out of water.
2903 2018-03-13 18:38:48 In this week's #museology episode, I confess to damaging a 17th century Dutch oil painting. I just called the musem, 24 years later, to confess. I will now live tweet this experience.
2904 2018-03-13 18:38:47 Destroy the environment. Allow more corporations to pollute our air, water and soil for profit. Ruin our schools. Let dirty oil thrive while hurting clean energy. Allowing animals to be killed for fun and profit. Take health care from millions. Take good from millions.

2906 2018-03-13 18:38:36 He died as he lived: Drilling Texas for oil.
2907 2018-03-13 18:38:36 I was told Argan oil was better
2908 2018-03-13 18:38:34 Last year he was Putin’s puppet for hiring a guy who did oil deals with Russia. 

Now he’s Putin’s puppet for firing the same guy who called out russia for the assassination of an ex spy. 

Can’t make this stuff up.
2909 2018-03-13 18:38:28 I pulled up for an oil change and these niggas nickel and diming their way to a whole new engine Smh
2910 2018-03-13 18:38:27 Not to worry, he's lying to the aluminum workers too. Trudeau's carbon tax is going to make manufacturing in Canada cost prohibitive - just like he is doing with oil & gas development.
Sad.
2911 2018-03-13 18:38:24 Conservatives shit on ppl for not “appreciating the sacrifices of the military for defending our home” and then destroy that home for profit and oil so they can overspend on that same military and make them kill brown people for more oil and profit
2912 2018-03-13 18:38:07 Yeezy motor oil 
2913 2018-03-13 18:38:05 Happy birthday 
2914 2018-03-13 18:37:56 Can’t believe Mena got me a huge gallon of coconut oil for my bday, like omg yes bitchh! Clear skin, long nails, and healthy hair for a year 
2915 2018-03-13 18:37:47 i want some cannibis oil 
2916 2018-03-13 18:37:42 #wti #crude #oil price $61.38
2917 2018-03-13 18:37:38 Mct oil helps with tiredness if you’re low carbing etc
2918 2018-03-13 18:37:08 Oh! our allies are helping us. EU still purchasing Russia natural gas, oil, etc. at record levels. Only dopey USA imposed meaningful sanctions over Ukraine. We $ cover EU defense and they rebuild their infrastructure.
2919 2018-03-13 18:37:04 May has no cards to play, we are energy dependant on Russian oil and gas & they know it. There will be the usual tit for tat expulsions of low ranking diplomats & calls for England to boycott World Cup, then business as usual, Tory Party accepting donations from Russian oligarchs
2920 2018-03-13 18:37:04 Only Trump could make a former billionaire oil executive seem sympathetic.
2921 2018-03-13 18:36:56 went to get my eyebrows waxed and the lady dropped the wax stick on accident. spent 20 min trying to get it out... with baby oil... life’s gooooood 
2922 2018-03-13 18:36:49 Baby boomers and automated systems are water and oil
2923 2018-03-13 18:36:40 I'm guessing no Kompromat, just arctic oil. Oil gone, true feelings are coming out. And trying to restore some dignity.
2924 2018-03-13 18:36:37 My bf is currently getting an afternoon drink as a *treat yo self* reward for getting his oil changed. Proof he is as extra as I am
2925 2018-03-13 18:36:31 it's hard but your hair feels so much better after! i used a sea salt/water spray to bring back my curls and countered the drying effect w weekly coconut oil and jojoba oil overnight treatments.
2926 2018-03-13 18:36:28 Nah, he's going back to big oil thinking, "what the hell was I doing?"
2927 2018-03-13 18:36:13 Not to mention all the animals the oil killed and all the fisheries out of work for years. Oyster, shrimp, etc; all impacted and therefore the income from fisheries. Motels lost business with oil slime on beautiful white sand beaches.
2928 2018-03-13 18:36:12 Making mayonnaise is weird. It thickens as you stir in more oil, which doesn't seem like something that should happen. I guess it's some sort of interaction between the egg yolk and the oil?
2929 2018-03-13 18:36:08 How is that even relevant? I don't get my info from the oil and gas industry, I get it from RESEARCH. It's clear you've done none. 

Typical "tolerant" (hateful) Leftist. You assume I'm "alt-right" , based on five sentences, when I am NOTHING OF THE SORT.
2930 2018-03-13 18:35:58 i just bought rose hip oil... im officially done spending money on face products
2931 2018-03-13 18:35:57 How do they make steel with wind and solar?  Pixie dust in th furnaces?  Why can’t you support Alberta oil to tide water instead of the Saudi oil?
2932 2018-03-13 18:35:56 Say what you want about Tillerson but don’t badmouth the oil. Leave the oil out of this
2933 2018-03-13 18:35:48 Old: Dirty filthy OIL man w ties to Kremlin. New: voice of reason. Save Iran deal.
2934 2018-03-13 18:35:45 It’s true because Toyota, Hyundai, other brands offer free two-three years of oil change/service, cash back incentives, and 0% finance while Honda does not do anything and the least they ever offered was .9%.
2935 2018-03-13 18:35:34 Always have been a huge fan of @Toyota vehicles but changing the oil on our 4 runner is ridiculous. Completely over engineered. The engine and cabin air filters were easy at least.
2936 2018-03-13 18:35:33 Nostalgic for the days we decried Tillerson as a corrupt oil exec
2937 2018-03-13 18:35:31 would think scenario it would make the most sense is non local fx denominated bonds.  could have oil producer for instance with large $ holdings while govmt running short.  only caveat is ratings agencies likely assume gvmt would just nationalize in that case a la lot of EM
2938 2018-03-13 18:35:18 Roadshow Asks: How often do you change your car oil? - Roadshow
2939 2018-03-13 18:35:11 Eyes rolled when an Oil executive was named Secretary of State. Now unhappy w/his departure. How did we get here?
2940 2018-03-13 18:34:44 Yes and based on the same figures the U.K. were using at the time. What about now at $70 a barrel and more oil being discovered. BP want to increase production from just one of their sites to 200,000 barrels a DAY. Oil is far from worthless.
2941 2018-03-13 18:34:41 There are about 200 jombies vye cakalack sutty that leaking ole oil in every school and constituency, and you is one is u read this 
2942 2018-03-13 18:34:39 Plus under Obama US built 1000's of miles of pipelines, more than doubled exports of oil to eastern Canada- no wonder they fund anti pipeline nutters in Canada & blocked energy east - smart business for them, spineless gov for us that allows this
2943 2018-03-13 18:34:15 I really need an oil change but then again I really really need my nails done .. I also don’t feel like girls should take the car to get an oil change 
2944 2018-03-13 18:34:08 Inplay Oil Corp. (IPO) Analysts See $0.01 E...
2945 2018-03-13 18:34:02 i never thought of #rextillerson as much more than a money grubbing oil magnate master of the universe who probably didn't deserve that job anyway...but he will forever get points for a) 'fucking moron' and b) that shady ass farewell speech. well done, rex. well done.
2946 2018-03-13 18:34:00 Schwarzenegger is crazy. All this will do is raise the oil prices and hurt the tax payer. But I am sure he does not care. Climate Change is a joke and cost the tax payer billions in fake news.
2947 2018-03-13 18:33:56 Excellent observation! They deflect until you forget orig question. Drug companies don’t want medical marijuana because they will lose $. Elderly relative died last year. Last 4 months took her off all opioids because marijuana oil rub did more good to control paid.Cheaper too!
2948 2018-03-13 18:33:53 Rex Tillerson taking UCB classes now, he’s got a medical marijuana license, he’s about to start an ashram with his oil money
2949 2018-03-13 18:33:49 Living it up on my vacation...put together a shelving unit, went to the store and getting my car an oil change and a bath.  #AdultingSoHard
2950 2018-03-13 18:33:42 Perhaps Rex completed Trumps dealings with the oil countries & corporations (often one in the same).  Now a new phase for more military diplomatic issues. Rex will still advise all sides, naturally protecting his pension stake.
2951 2018-03-13 18:33:39 hate the smell of this coconut oil
2952 2018-03-13 18:33:33 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.

2954 2018-03-13 18:33:18 Omg! I didn’t even know ulta carried these wow! I haven’t purchased anything from their website in a while so I wouldn’t know :( Aloe Vera, vitamin C and E oil will help! They do wonders for your skin

2956 2018-03-13 18:33:11 Happy birthday, Twicky Six!
2957 2018-03-13 18:33:09 I'm still waiting for Iraqi oil to pay for the war.
2958 2018-03-13 18:33:03 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "Mineral Oil Submerged PC Build Log Part 1 - Puget Systems Kit Case Assembly" à l'adresse
2959 2018-03-13 18:33:02 every time i see winwin pour that oil into the cold water i genuinely lose 200 brain cells
2960 2018-03-13 18:32:57 He was never a Russian puppet. He represented Exxon in oil deals w Russian oil companies. Those were win-win managed risk deals.
2961 2018-03-13 18:32:54 Tuesday is women’s day at the Castrol place? 10% off my oil change! Plus the free car wash. Noice.
2962 2018-03-13 18:32:44 Progressive? What do you mean? Sultans, sheikhs, kings, princes, royal families. huh!
Till 70s they were desert pirates n sea pirates.
Oil money, so import even bananas n spoons!
They throw money to get work done by goras.
Very poor literacy rates, but neck deep indebted.

2965 2018-03-13 18:32:30 Me. Kumkumadi tailam (saffron oil) one drop is enough for under both eyes. Tried and tested.
2966 2018-03-13 18:32:25 Alternatively; 'president Putin needs me back in the oil game'.
2967 2018-03-13 18:32:25 Oil watch it!
2968 2018-03-13 18:32:24 @Plaid_Tillerson Once an oil man always an OIL man for Iran.
2969 2018-03-13 18:32:23 The name petroleum covers both naturally occurring unprocessed crude oil and petroleum products that are made up of refined crude oil.
2970 2018-03-13 18:32:21 Went to get my oil changed came out with a new tire 
2971 2018-03-13 18:31:59 Hence my anger towards Edmonds and his ilk. A total fucking dick like those other eejits who claim praying cures cancer etc. Snake oil.
2972 2018-03-13 18:31:46 Oil ties to Putin,only reason Rexxon hired. It's ALL about the 
2973 2018-03-13 18:31:39 Bye Uncle Rex........sorry those billions of dollars of oil deals with Russia probably won't come to fruition, but then again, maybe they will.
2974 2018-03-13 18:31:31 Albany super satin, had to lay that off to, seems oil based works best what I’ve seen at least.they were great in emulsion, seen reviews being used in oil looks great finish.
2975 2018-03-13 18:31:22 19% of half trillion oil deal between Exxon and Rosneft, held up b/c sanctions.
2976 2018-03-13 18:31:16 Makes synthetic crude which is easily refined at pretty much any refinery. No heavy oil requirements needed.also gets premium dollar for the product.
2977 2018-03-13 18:31:15 And 'activists' for the oil and gas industry a backed by the billionaire Koch brothers. What hypocrisy are these conservatives and alt-right followers. Most of Greenpeace's funds come from small donors, and you know it. Typical conservative liar.
2978 2018-03-13 18:31:11 You're very welcome Charlotte.  I hope it helps. Make it yourself.  It's so easy and much cheaper. I get my Tumeric from the Indian shop. Make sure it's pure coconut oil and the black pepper is freshly ground at the end x
2979 2018-03-13 18:31:05 Please stop attaching negative connotations to the phrase “snake oil salesman” because it’s getting really hard to move the stuff
2980 2018-03-13 18:31:00 .@SecretaryZinke, your offshore drilling proposal threatens to coat our beaches with oil spills and pollute our air and water #ProtectOurCoast
2981 2018-03-13 18:30:49 He blocked me for liking a tweet that commented on him being wrong in the past. He really is the classic snake oil salesman! I do hope karma sorts him out.
2982 2018-03-13 18:30:46 Stir together 9 oz dates with 2 1/2 pints clams. Blend with Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve over kale.
2983 2018-03-13 18:30:43 So, the only reason #RexT was selected by trump was bcause RT was a "friend of Russia" & Putin! & he had exp making deals all ovr world (albeit, oil deals!)
2984 2018-03-13 18:30:43 @France24_en #tillersonfired  he did what he shouldn't do in meetings, like in Nigeria he shouldn't talk about oil deals but talk about terrorism and brutality on Biafrans by Nigeria government.
2985 2018-03-13 18:30:39 Damn, Apple got it like that? Nice, what about the Aramcos and em' oil dudes? Wow
2986 2018-03-13 18:30:37 Not really we export mostly heavy oil to US. They produce almost none. Their industry needs heavy oil which they will have to import from somewhere
2987 2018-03-13 18:30:33 Idk how people can add on oil to there foundation I be looking greasy than a mf .
2988 2018-03-13 18:30:31 All the news networks now praising Rex Tillerson, ... its why we are in this mess. 

He was an Oil man hired to do bidding of oil  companies which continue to destroy our environment.

just shut up @MSNBC and @Cnn
2989 2018-03-13 18:30:29 There is a list of questions that must be answered before purge time….
1.Volume of generator case?
2.Size of piping, number of valves, number of bends, length of piping?
3.Blanket or flood purge (quicker)?
4.Seal oil differential pressure control?

#H2 #Webinar #Utility #Safety
2990 2018-03-13 18:30:21 Guess ol’ Rex will, as a private citizen, show ol’ Vlad how to get that oil out of the Arctic.  16 billion to the Ruskies.
2991 2018-03-13 18:30:20 Thanks for following on Twitter! Probe supply high-tech tools and equipment to the Oil & Gas Industry. Like us on Facebook and see #SayProbe posts from around the world! March 13, 2018 at 01:30PM
2992 2018-03-13 18:30:17 More complex than that.  Can directly impact oil companies that import Iranian oil, not just nations.  As such, individual companies will behave as it best suits their company...buy other oil.
2993 2018-03-13 18:30:15 OIL DIFF: 4.0 -> 4.1
2994 2018-03-13 18:30:13 Unsustainable. Oh, you mean like the oil industry, that crashes and burns every 15 - 25 years? Few industries are more unstable than O&G is. 
Take a look though - O&G companies are announcing expansions in Alberta. Guess DH missed that.
2995 2018-03-13 18:30:10 500 tax code , military deferment . Started off as our God loving country our troops. Now , pay and die for our wars , but not your God, but to our oil fields and radical take over. Good news , Good news. NOT HAPPENING.  Real power hates money and man system. Can't BUY this @TBN
2996 2018-03-13 18:30:09 rex tillerson is taking a shot of oil from the drill
2997 2018-03-13 18:30:07 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
2998 2018-03-13 18:29:57 Emu oil? The mind boggles.
2999 2018-03-13 18:29:53 @Newsday_TT @UNCTnT @KamlaUNC Is State oil being stolen from Petrotrin oil-tanks at Catshill Oilfields, asked Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar at UNC Monday NIght Forum at St Joseph Secondary School.
3000 2018-03-13 18:29:48 A moderately-priced old world styled Bordeaux can pair well with pan seared salmon over garlic mashed potatoes with chive oil.
3001 2018-03-13 18:29:47 Tillerson hasn’t felt this clean in months. Now back to negotiating oil deals with Russia on his own behalf. Oh, wait...
3002 2018-03-13 18:29:41 This powerful message draws attention to deforestation driven by unsustainable palm oil production.

Back at home, we can help protect forests + wildlife by looking for #sustainable #palmoil when shopping.
3003 2018-03-13 18:29:39 I identify with this because I fold my pizza specially because I put olive oil on it
3004 2018-03-13 18:29:39 LIFE HACK: 
     Rub Extra Virgin Olive Oil on after sex to stay a virgin.
3005 2018-03-13 18:29:38 it works for some people! it depends on your cramps. It doesn’t completely get rid of mine but it does help!!! Best way to do it is to drop 2 or 3 drops of oil directly on the tampon. Works better than putting it on your skin.

@HarryMeraNaam 
3007 2018-03-13 18:29:30 All oil is not the same. The US produces virtually no heavy oil and heavy oil is mostly what we send to them. For industrial uses light oil cannot address the needs filled by heavy oils
3008 2018-03-13 18:29:29 Oil.
3009 2018-03-13 18:29:21 GAHSHS ME I GOT BURNG OIL ON MY ARM also this is me trying not to swear wow
3010 2018-03-13 18:29:15 Let's not forget, Tillersons medal of friendship from Putin and no sanctions enacted to free up Russia oil lands...... Tillerson IS an oil man after all.....
3011 2018-03-13 18:28:58 Yes you do don't you? You stabbed Albertan oil workers in the back though didn't you, it's the only way you had our backs, with knives sticking out of them! You're killing the energy sector in the west because Justin has always been jealous of Alberta!
3012 2018-03-13 18:28:58 Or the stinkiest
3013 2018-03-13 18:28:58 When a big oil executive is the most sympathetic and humane person in your cabinet, you’ve got issues.   #REXIT #RexTillerson
3014 2018-03-13 18:28:52 Damn. Coconut oil really blessed my skin 
3015 2018-03-13 18:28:50 In the best interest of oil investors like the Koch brothers.
3016 2018-03-13 18:28:47 My way of tanning is putting some shorts on, a crop top, tanning oil and going for a 5K run .

3018 2018-03-13 18:28:29 REX TILLERSON: I take my coffee oil sands black
3019 2018-03-13 18:28:25 COPEC has proved to be a sham organization- they have proved their ignorance of the oil downstream structure nor of its technical operations
3020 2018-03-13 18:28:23 Bye, Rex, rather, good riddance. Any oil man that believes that globalwarmingclimatechangeherecomesaniceage hoax doesn't belong in any position of influence.
3021 2018-03-13 18:28:13 Translation: the giant pile of money I was supposed to get from brokering that half trillion dollar oil deal with Russia has not materialized. Screw you all.
3022 2018-03-13 18:28:10 It took the service department an hour and a half to inspect and change my oil 
3023 2018-03-13 18:28:09 Well he just wasn't able to reverse Russians saunctions fast enough to get to that arctic oil eh? He is still in the oil business, don't feel sorry for him. State will long feel his gutting of staff. #TillersonRotInHell
3024 2018-03-13 18:28:08 tea tree oil has made such a difference on my skin !!!
3025 2018-03-13 18:28:03 My only respect for Rex Tillerson  is that he called Trump a moron. I hope he continues to speak the truth, yet he's a (R) and an oil oligarch so I have little to no faith.
3026 2018-03-13 18:28:00 Great! I have the Booze and Baccy and a summer fragrance would be a great add! I’ll have to wait and see as I don’t need the moustache wax but oil and balm would be good! Thanks for replying!
3027 2018-03-13 18:27:59 Wasn’t everyone crying how he was a oil ceo and had strong ties with Russia when he was nominated. Now he’s gone and your upset???
3028 2018-03-13 18:27:57 He still is unable to answer a question.  @SecretaryZinke is getting kick backs by oil and gas.  It is that simple for these guys.  How much can they make personally?
3029 2018-03-13 18:27:52 Yep. Oil and water. This felt inevitable.
3030 2018-03-13 18:27:46 No. Exxon pulled out of the Rosneft deal a week ago. Rex serves no purpose anymore.. them being at odds over Russia is justification for Rex to return to Exxon (visit oil states in Africa first)
3031 2018-03-13 18:27:38 Rex Tillerson will return to doing what he loves most: Drowning wildlife in oil

3034 2018-03-13 18:27:26 When you put too much olive oil on your legs....now you can't put one leg on the other because it's Just going tip slip off 
3035 2018-03-13 18:27:20 I read somewhere that tea tree oil is an essential oil and needs to be diluted with a carrier oil, it shouldn't be used directly, maybe that's why it burned. You can look up essential oils and carrier oils for more info :)
3036 2018-03-13 18:27:19 Oil should be trading $10 higher. Absolutely no geopolitical risk premium in the current price. Given we are at or close to the 5 year inventory level, Brent should be close to $80.  No way USA shale matches lost supply.
3037 2018-03-13 18:27:18 Decarbonized #electricity by 2050 is achievable but this does not mean zero investment in oil & gas. #Renewables cannot meet demand growth + fill the gap left by a rapid move away from coal, and oil/gas production typically declines 5-10%/yr without investment. Do the math Prof!
3038 2018-03-13 18:27:10 hmmmm Can we start trending rumors that others in his admin said disparaging things about Russia? Like...
Remember when Steve Miller claimed Russia sends us ISIS immigrants?

3040 2018-03-13 18:26:56 got my oil change done for free at my sisters job 
3041 2018-03-13 18:26:52 if you don't think beds are burning by midnight oil is an iconic banger then get the fuck out this shit slaps hard
3042 2018-03-13 18:26:40 Legit only letting my facial hair grow out to use up some beard oil and shampoo mum got me for Christmas
3043 2018-03-13 18:26:40 I have to get an oil change then I'll see
3044 2018-03-13 18:26:37 #CNNisFakeNews vilified Secretary Tillerson as the evil oil man, today after his firing; it's "he was honorable and carried with dignity."

#MSM Sucks
3045 2018-03-13 18:26:34 Meh? Like the tub I buy only has 30carbs and I’m only eating 1/4th when I do? Plus it gives me a ton of fat cause of the olive oil?
3046 2018-03-13 18:26:32 Trump appointed Rex Tillerson ExxonMobil leader to secretary of state position to complete deal with Rosneft oil ( 9 trillion dollar!) . Due to sanctions , it was not completed. Tillerson out.
3047 2018-03-13 18:26:30 We must all ponder the paradoxical or extremely abrupt change of interests that this hiring and firing reveals... He was needed because of Oil and Gas interests and fired for criticizing a major producer/ provider ???? ...hmmmmm....
3048 2018-03-13 18:26:30 He's a Republican looter who wants to polllute our planet with more oil.
3049 2018-03-13 18:26:28 I put this over oil too tbh. My esthetician was AMAZED how moisturized my skin was after the weather this winter
3050 2018-03-13 18:26:26 thc infused coconut oil in the coffee. #bet
3051 2018-03-13 18:26:21 it would be good if every oil man had to end their career by squishing their face into their neck on live tv after getting fired on twitter
3052 2018-03-13 18:26:07 Just remind yourself he was the CEO of an oil company that spent decades raping and spoiling the environment for profit. And brought on global warming. And the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
You're welcome.
3053 2018-03-13 18:26:06 Having my truck back has been so much fun I just need to get it to stop leaking oil and I will be so stoked.
3054 2018-03-13 18:25:48 Along with all the good work,ur next step should be for oil n gas industry,ppl suffered a lot!
3055 2018-03-13 18:25:45 Lavender is one of the best, all-purpose herbs and oils to have around. Use lavender for dream magic, grounding, emotional balance, easing anxiety, rebirth, and much much more.

Bonus: our Lavender essential oil is on sale at the moment!
3056 2018-03-13 18:25:44 Dangerous times in the region. With #Tillerson gone, nothing stands in #Trump's way in fulfilling deal with Saudi Crown Prince in targeting #Lebanon with aim of "destroying" #Hezbollah & securing #Israel offshore oil interests. 1/2
3057 2018-03-13 18:25:40 I took loads when 1st dx’d which ended up making me feel sick so now just take fish oil, but I have kefir every day and turmeric x
3058 2018-03-13 18:25:39 No, Middle distilates are becoming more important. What you may be seeing is the Shale oil effect. The running of a very light gasoline heavy crude rather than medium crude
3059 2018-03-13 18:25:36 Tory Government wants to keep Russian oil and gas money in London. £ instead of morality.
3060 2018-03-13 18:25:27 Blessings for your special day!! Sorry your present was stolen from you, a true champion!!
3061 2018-03-13 18:25:18 I had ordered a product Aroma magic oil (happiness variant) but i want Aroma magic oil(Dreams variant) i am expecting a exhange but u say its not possible why its not possible when we are requesting as a exception
3062 2018-03-13 18:25:15 Using coconut oil on my face never seemed like a good idea lol
3063 2018-03-13 18:25:15 #Florida @SenBillNelson on a @SecretaryZinke comment today that FL is still "in the (oil drilling) process": "The Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, in front of the Senate Energy Committee today, has just said very confusingly–but bottom line–Florida is still on the table."
3064 2018-03-13 18:25:14 Felt like she was giving me rug burn all over my body, I don’t know what she had against using more oil or lotion.

My feet are clean, but, why would you massage my feet right before my face? 

She burned the fk out of my foot with a hot towel.
3065 2018-03-13 18:25:11 Because of inept politicians this country is missing billions and billions from LNG and Oil exports.

Also, failing to become 100% energy self-sufficient but instead wasting billions by importing oil from highly questionable regimes!

Utterly disgusted with our politicians!!
3066 2018-03-13 18:24:57 *adds to list* I’ve been using straight jojoba oil which helps but doesn’t do enough. I’m gonna try this instead 
3067 2018-03-13 18:24:55 ぽんぺ撲滅しなきゃ
3068 2018-03-13 18:24:52 #CatholicTwitter - what is the oil for #anointingofthesick made of? It smells familiar (prob bc I get it so much!) but I can't place it!
3069 2018-03-13 18:24:49 @WeEOLC @thismorning discussion about cannabis oil as a treatment/cure for cancer. 
More patients are using this including ones I work with. Would be interested to hear thoughts/research.
3070 2018-03-13 18:24:40 CBD oil is proper minging, fucking hell
3071 2018-03-13 18:24:35 Well, there goes that $500 billion oil deal...
3072 2018-03-13 18:24:33 “Gutting the state department has been one of the greatest joys of my life—second only to bathing in tubs full of crude oil and hundred dollar bills.”
-Rex Tillerson
3073 2018-03-13 18:24:32 I’ve asked Rex T. To leave Trump Acres. He screwed me on my last oil change. Congratulations to all. - Donny T.
3074 2018-03-13 18:24:32 I feel bad for Rex Tillerson, who has to return to everyday life as an oil oligarch.
3075 2018-03-13 18:24:31 Because the vice principal clearly drives some beast that's leaking oil BAD!!!
3076 2018-03-13 18:24:29 So #trump replaced an oil executive with a Christian RWNJ what could go wrong
3077 2018-03-13 18:24:12 So I have to give maverick vitamins and fish oil bc he got a rash from rolling around on my carpet after a bath & I had put down carpet freshener, well he eats them pills like they're a treat. 
3078 2018-03-13 18:24:10 They don't even want our shitty oil. The whole project is not economically viable. #KeepItInTheGround #StopKinderMorgan
3079 2018-03-13 18:24:01 Im loving my air fryer!!!!!!!!!
Works like convection.. FAST!!!
Crispy food like u fryed it in oil
With no oil... I dont even clean it after every use.. Super easy to use
3080 2018-03-13 18:24:01 Don't. He is an oil baron who doesn't care about the environment hack who decided to work for Donald Fucking Trump. He knew what he was doing.
3081 2018-03-13 18:23:57 They should call him "Sex" Tillerson because after reaching Peak Oil, he's no longer interested in cuddling
3082 2018-03-13 18:23:51 Russia put Tillerson in place to remove sanctions so they could get at that oil reserve in the Artic. As soon as he said something bad about them he got fired. That's so crazy. How do people think this Russia thing is made up.
3083 2018-03-13 18:23:49 Some oil and gas people deeply pride themselves on having never been "fired".   Can't say that about myself.

3085 2018-03-13 18:23:46 Imagine being an Oil Company CEO, getting talked into taking the SecState job you were wildly unqualified for, then getting fired via twitter...
3086 2018-03-13 18:23:37 2day at work someone asked me if we do coconut oil that doesn't smell of coconuts 
3087 2018-03-13 18:23:35 Great question,  oils actually break down quickly in comparison to plastics. So I'd imagine that microparticles of asphalt may do the same.  Problems occur with large quantities of oil based products or if it settles to the sea bed where it can remain for many years / be eaten.
3088 2018-03-13 18:23:17 $28 OUNCES OF FLOWER!! 10 dollar Grams of all GROHI OILS!!! $10 Grams of shatter! Amazing Deals on Oil only @greentherapy_I5_eugene !
3089 2018-03-13 18:23:16 A lot of patients I work with use cannabis oil and we are looking always at new treatments. We’re open to new things but also work to manage the expectation. It’s good to discuss though & be open minded.
3090 2018-03-13 18:23:16 Just standard hummus? I scoop out a smallish portion and then mix in olive oil. Eat with cheese? Veggies?
3091 2018-03-13 18:23:09 Yep got his Exxon Russian oil deal and ruined Americas state dept so yay for Rex!
3092 2018-03-13 18:23:03 Rex Tillerson, the stereotypical oil exec, ACTUALLY practiced diplomacy, upholding the Iran deal framework, and trying to mitigate Saudi Arabia and Qatar’s rift. Feel like we’re getting a psycho neo-con next. 
3093 2018-03-13 18:23:03 Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. I never thought I would say this about an oil company executive turned Secretary of State... you have shown great courage and grace today.  Thank you for your service.
3094 2018-03-13 18:22:56 i thought there'd be more oil tycoon/well oiled machine jokes tbh
3095 2018-03-13 18:22:54 Thank you! It’s simply a large amount of vegetables cooked in olive oil then add tomato sauce then I make a béchamel sauce and using whole meal lasagne sheets & grated cheese on top. The @SamHeughan sweet potato wedges are with coconut oil, cayenne & Himalayan pink salt, very 
3096 2018-03-13 18:22:48 What flavor??  I just got one for myself that is French Pear- light scent but nice. They also had lotion, body oil & bath bombs.
3097 2018-03-13 18:22:47 @theSNP oil made by `midge`
3098 2018-03-13 18:22:45 The Huffpost pic above is awesome. She's smiling because she approves of poop over oil. Wonder which one powers her jet and her luxury SUV?
3099 2018-03-13 18:22:43 How high up does the oil start leaking from? The head gasket? The valve cover? Someplace specific?
3100 2018-03-13 18:22:41 今から行くのが楽しみです！
3101 2018-03-13 18:22:38 I need help changing my oil. Does that count?
3102 2018-03-13 18:22:36 In the meantime, congratulations, Tillerson, I know you'll be much happier not having to deal with the "moron" Prez and making multi-million dollars in your private sector niche - oil.
3103 2018-03-13 18:22:35 Please do not weep for me, I will now return to a private life as a private American citizen, where I will go back to reaping outrageous oil industry profits at the expense of the planet and future generations. God bless America.

3106 2018-03-13 18:22:24 All I can say is a very big fuck you to Rex Tillerson, fucking smug piece of shit. Oil is so yesterday and so are you. #SayonaraHairPlugs

コスプレがんばりゅ！
3108 2018-03-13 18:22:15 i would rather go to the dentist, the doctor, and the mvd all in the same day rather than go to get my oil changed
3109 2018-03-13 18:22:02 Thought the same; you'd think he'd be happy. Wonder what he was more busted-up about; that Dolt45 canned him or that he wasn't going to get his oil deal with Putin-it-in.
3110 2018-03-13 18:22:01 @theSNP all you have is OIL
3111 2018-03-13 18:21:59 Bad news for Oiler fans. Tkachuk running around like he does is what usually fires up the Oil.
3112 2018-03-13 18:21:55 See, but I thought a calzone was just like ricotta and garlic oil and it’s folded in - a Stromboli could have any number of “toppings” in it and it’s also like rolled? I’m gonna get beat up by y’all.
3113 2018-03-13 18:21:52 He took it to help oil interests?
3114 2018-03-13 18:21:49 Rex Tillerson will be leaving his post as Secretary of State to go home and spend more time with his oil.
3115 2018-03-13 18:21:41 just did my own oil change!
i feel accomplished.
3116 2018-03-13 18:21:38 my skin has become so soft and glowy since I started using rosehip oil the past week, I reeeeally recommend it
3117 2018-03-13 18:21:29 I'm not crying too many tears for him, to be honest. His policies were quite bad and he's going to be riding off into the sunset on his Big Oil pony.
3118 2018-03-13 18:21:22 this pomegranate hair oil smells bad ugh
3119 2018-03-13 18:21:22 I bought this Jamaican castor oil for my beard... idk if I should apply only at night.. or after my showers 
3120 2018-03-13 18:21:15 Weird Thought #5 Did you know Canola oil comes from this thing called Rapeseed... Good thing they called it Canola. #awkward #rapeoil
3121 2018-03-13 18:20:58 OIL 15M chart setting up bullish. A break above  60.76=50MA would be confirmation bullish. UWT ? WATCH

3123 2018-03-13 18:20:46 I'm sure he's nervous-- not even an oil kingpin can be comfortable with the extent to which our national security looks like a reality-show train wreck.
3124 2018-03-13 18:20:42 Some places are just too special to drill. @SecretaryZinke, withdraw oil and gas leases on land near the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument #KeepItPublic
3125 2018-03-13 18:20:41 Also “worship putin” is crazy. Obama did nothing when Crimea was annexed, and when they intervened in Syria. Romney said Russia was #1 foe and was mocked by him.  Increasing domestic oil and gas prod. also hurts Russia. Trump hasn’t been as hard as I’d like, but harder than Obama
3126 2018-03-13 18:20:32 Lmao I can;t spray no water on my hair then my twist definition gonna be GONE! lmao it's gon shrink into a lil bush. I can do the oil though
3127 2018-03-13 18:20:31 Of Course #RexTillerson is out

3128 2018-03-13 18:20:29 なんだかんだ働くこと自体が好きなんすけど、最近忙しいのもあって疲れも忘れて熱を入れすぎてるのかなと。世間的には悪いことではないのかもしれませんが、他に何もやる気にならなくて、まぁ楽しくはないですよね
3129 2018-03-13 18:20:23 before I watch, let me guess. 'I don't care about people or things, I want all the oil, and I'll kill you all for it, but our rotting pumpkin of a president says I'm being too obvious about it, so I'm getting my own island in Fiji to sulk, paid for by US tax dollars'
3130 2018-03-13 18:20:18 Girl I hated olive oil it absorbs too quickly. I had to use mad diff products and shit. Her hair has finally grown . I washed every Sunday or every other then I twist it up for a few days , do a co-wash then braid it for 2 weeks . And I would braid the front forward or the side
3131 2018-03-13 18:20:18 What a great birthday present that win would have been on Sunday! Great showing @robertwickens !
3132 2018-03-13 18:20:17 Like a drop of oil, the truth is spreading little by little ... And they can not stop it ......
3133 2018-03-13 18:20:06 Are we sure we’re not in the Upside-Down because I’m feeling pangs of empathy towards oil industry shitheel Rex Tillerson during his visibly shaken exit speech?
3134 2018-03-13 18:20:05 Rex Tillerson will return to the large Oil Barrel he once called home. #TillersonOut
3135 2018-03-13 18:19:59 Who? I thought that dude overdosed in the nineties?
3136 2018-03-13 18:19:56 Very welcome, and agreed. We'll have to wait for the books and movies, but my guess is he came into the job looking to work the Exxon end, dealing with Russia for their huge reserves of sanctioned oil (Rosneft). There was a conversion somewhere along the way, much to his credit.
3137 2018-03-13 18:19:55 Have you tried Golden paste Charlotte.  It's amazing.

3141 2018-03-13 18:19:19 Why is @StateDept @AltStateDpt voice sound shaky. Poor poor #RexTillerson. He should have known securing @exxonmobil some Russian oil fields was not worth the humiliation. Or was it  @MSNBC
3142 2018-03-13 18:19:17 i'm trying out a oil treatment thingy from lush and holla, the consistency is like the weirdest thing ever
3143 2018-03-13 18:19:10 Soon as I put peppermint oil on my scalp I can feel that shit 
3144 2018-03-13 18:19:06 Hasn’t he already been promised a piece of the big Russian oil deal once Trump lifts the sanctions?
3145 2018-03-13 18:19:01 We looked into developing concessionary loan products for it when I was at @WSHFC, but SCL couldn't share market data for reasons @Chris_Bast mentioned. Heating oil industry was not inclined to share either.
The marketing/outreach piece as beyond our capacity.
3146 2018-03-13 18:19:01 You get no argument there, bro.

On the other hand, Much like the Middle East, Kim’s a$$ has massive tons of oil, and both have been invaded by the West.
3147 2018-03-13 18:18:55 I was waiting for him to ground me from the car
3148 2018-03-13 18:18:36 You should definitely see a dentist! But I know clove and oregano oil definitely help.

3152 2018-03-13 18:18:18 It happened in Libya with its oil before they decided to brand him as evil and hunted him down.
3153 2018-03-13 18:18:06 Exactly my first thought. BIG OIL CEO ----> KOCH BROS DENALIST :P
3154 2018-03-13 18:18:04 Organic whole soy beans, organic whole grain wheat, organic wheat bran, organic yellow corn, organic sunflower seed husks (source of fiber), minerals, organic coconut oil, brewers yeast (source of highly digestible protein and amino acids),
3155 2018-03-13 18:18:00 I’m waiting to get my oil changed and this 30 year old is sitting here playing with a Tamagotchi 
3156 2018-03-13 18:17:56 and as the deficit continues to feed the greedy and corrupt government backed oil companies, War Contractors Companies, Medical & Pharmaceuticals Industries, 3rd world countries like Israel ($4B/year), the American people fall further and further in debt! Wake up America!
3157 2018-03-13 18:17:45 Voetsek wena!!  That oil is amazing.
3158 2018-03-13 18:17:43 He's a Russian-friendship comrade, has the medal and the Russian - Exxon oil deal to prove it 
3159 2018-03-13 18:17:39 2018 is the year we feel bad for a Big Oil CEO #RexTillerson
3160 2018-03-13 18:17:36 And Putin wants that pipeline across NK and SK and can't do it with NK sanctions in place. All about oil

3163 2018-03-13 18:17:22 I never thought id go to different institutes it being public sector, oil & gas, retail etc and consulting them how to best run their business. It really doesn’t sink in until after a crazy quarter.

3165 2018-03-13 18:17:03 The difference between the Petro and the other cryptocurrencies is that the Petro is created by a nation and in turn regulated by its fluctuations. In addition, it is supported by material resources such as gold, oil, gas, and diamonds.

3169 2018-03-13 18:16:46 So you gone fire the oil exec you picked and replace him with a career spook (spy) as sec of state......what special brand of madness is this
3170 2018-03-13 18:16:45 Sid Luft, deceased husband of actress Judy Garland, claimed in his memoir that Garland was molested by actors playing munchkins in The Wizard Of Oz. Garland told Luft she knew it was the munchkins and not other co-stars because there wasn’t any straw, oil or fur on her clothing.
3171 2018-03-13 18:16:37 210,000 gallons of oil just leaked from the Keystone pipeline after it burst....
3172 2018-03-13 18:16:29 #Tillerson was fired so that he could continue his work helping Russia control more of the Worlds oil. He can't do that as Sec. of State, so 45 let him go, and made it look like it was punishment.

You suckers fall for everything, and 45 knows it.

3181 2018-03-13 18:16:12 Years from now, how will  Tillerson be remembered in Washington?
1) he stood up to Putin
2) he called Trump a moron
3) "some oil guy from Texas"

It's Washington. Go with No. 3.
3182 2018-03-13 18:16:07 Ikea seriously should do Oil Changes too. I’d be a loyal customer.
3183 2018-03-13 18:16:04 Alberta and Saskatchewan oil exports... not so much.
3184 2018-03-13 18:16:01 President Donald Trump and his fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke on the phone “a little after noon time” on Tuesday, Tillerson said, hours after the President tweeted that he was replacing the former oil tycoon with CIA Director Mike Pompeo.
3185 2018-03-13 18:16:00 They do in hot oil #teenytinysadist
3186 2018-03-13 18:15:57 A single drop of oil pours down Rex Tillerson's cheek
3187 2018-03-13 18:15:51 OMG seriously. Well I'll try to drown it in oil when I get home. I truly hate washing my hair... it's a process
3188 2018-03-13 18:15:51 for the first time in like a year, I got an oil change and nothing additional needed to be done to my car... This is what happiness feels like
3189 2018-03-13 18:15:45 Tillerson had no business being Sec of state, but Trump asked him to serve and never inquired about his world view. He liked the image of an oil CEO. 
This whole thing was always a dumpster fire.
3190 2018-03-13 18:15:33 AWESOME
3191 2018-03-13 18:15:26 Same way as your face. I use the cleanse and facial brush (with the body brush). I spot treat with witch hazel. And I put some Portia M skin oil + raw Shea butter. If the skin that has dark marks is exposed to the sun, use sunscreen as well.
3192 2018-03-13 18:15:23 The Liberals rags are just making shit up. The major oil companies are positioned to make $billions and $billions via oil exploration and sales in Russia. Why would Tillerson want to create barriers to that?
3193 2018-03-13 18:15:21 Snake oil salesman...he is slimy as all get out.
3194 2018-03-13 18:15:20 found some oil in NLA. I think I'll gift it to L.
3195 2018-03-13 18:15:19 Tillerson's almost squeaky, he might need some oil.
3196 2018-03-13 18:15:18 In short when you are dumb you get shit on!! Klein's grade 3 education was just not good enough!! All of us bom in Alberta should be oil and gas sheiks getting $1 million share of resources at 21 instead we have this bullshit
3197 2018-03-13 18:15:16 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
3198 2018-03-13 18:15:15 Tillerson the top oil exec would not have tolerated any subordinate calling him a moron.
3199 2018-03-13 18:15:07 #Tillerson departure bullish for #Oil.  #Trump said he + Tillerson disagreed on policy issues + highlighted #IranNuclearDeal.  “... When you look at the #Iran deal: I think it’s terrible... I wanted to break it... he felt a little bit differently..." Trump told reporters
3200 2018-03-13 18:15:04 I hate when it take this long for a oil change 
3201 2018-03-13 18:14:57 That's how my daughter hair was . Dry but it has a nice soft texture and her curls be popping when wet. Yeah I would do the coconut oil or black Jamaican castor oil. And wash it with African Best shampoo & conditioner
Co-wash you could buy or just use the conditioner
3202 2018-03-13 18:14:57 I finally didn't get a ticket to. My hair is enjoying some coconut oil treatment…
3203 2018-03-13 18:14:40 You talkin' 'bout
"RExxon" -- 'Sanctions don't work' ('cuz my focking company is gonna sell oil to the Russians anyway) -- Tillerson? 

That guy?

3206 2018-03-13 18:14:14 I just learned cooking oil deactivates the glue in glue mouse traps which I despise, yay!!!
3207 2018-03-13 18:14:14 Palm oil on the European vegetable oils market rose on Tuesday in response to a firmer ringgit and stronger Malaysian palm oil futures on the back of hopes for improved demand. #tictocnews
3208 2018-03-13 18:14:10 He am "woke". 
3209 2018-03-13 18:14:01 Poor Rex, relegated to the poor life of being an oil tycoon. Should we do a kickstarter?
3210 2018-03-13 18:13:56 Clue: He works for the oil companies.
3211 2018-03-13 18:13:52 yes, it is best to drain it first (let it sit out and dry out a bit)...then bake it....for like 20-min. We don't use oil very much, but another option for a "crispy" tofu would be to stir fry it.
3212 2018-03-13 18:13:48 Will Rex Tillerson drop the mic after he's done with his press conference? Or maybe an oil can? $XOM
3213 2018-03-13 18:13:43 Russia must help north Korea with anything,including oil,food,Arms to defend themselves against imperialist who sanctioned both north Korea,Russia
3214 2018-03-13 18:13:39 I love me an orange...like orange and cream color on my skin tone.

3219 2018-03-13 18:13:18 But Iran has oil 
3220 2018-03-13 18:13:13 So, Canada contributes <2% of Global GHG. At the same time, we have some of the strictest regulations and cleanest upstream production. Thus, wouldn't supplanting global supply with CAD oil be a great solution to lowering GHG during transition? Yes.
3221 2018-03-13 18:13:13 On of my co-workers is straight up mental. She got envy that her then hubby didn't put sun screen on her when they went sun bathing, so instead of asking him like adult, she waited for him to nap and poured baby oil on his toes, letting em crisp like sausages. 

WTF woman?!

3223 2018-03-13 18:12:57 I use t for my lashes & scars.
And hand oil. Tbh it’s good for almost everything
3224 2018-03-13 18:12:47 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
3225 2018-03-13 18:12:45 Good thing Rex Tillerson has a career as an oil baron to fall back on.
3226 2018-03-13 18:12:44 thought the baby oil was bubble bath
3227 2018-03-13 18:12:43 Too much oil.
3228 2018-03-13 18:12:42 adulthood is boring the only dream i remember having last night was me walking around a world market looking for "the perfect oil dispenser" because im actually looking for one in real life

3233 2018-03-13 18:12:14 Immediate response to the oil spill? What, just looking at it is all good? What are they going to do if it's a major spill?
3234 2018-03-13 18:11:54 Did you watch tht video.  The man himself said it wasn't hidden.  We get over £1400 more per head here than the English get.  We have been part of the UNITED KINGDOM  since 1707.  Oil was discovered 247yrs later.  We will still b part of the UK long after the last drop of oil

3237 2018-03-13 18:11:39 A good example of how Trump’s deregulation measures affect our country! Currently sitting in the Gulf are about 250 abandoned oil rigs left by the rich oils companies. They are not pumping oils and cause an environmental problem. Trump’s regulation means they won’t remove them.

3256 2018-03-13 18:10:16 This is one of the most stupid tweets I have ever read. There is a power game being played out over areas of interest. This is about Nato, Syria, Iran, oil and gas. You are advocating a world war in which millions die? Idiotic, do research and read.

3259 2018-03-13 18:10:05 I changed my oil at exactly 3 yrs (56% life remaining; I trust GM's well-engineered oil life monitor) & had it analyzed by Blackstone labs (results: Typical for 1st oil change) 2nd change this May 6 yrs & ~140k miles (~50% life) & analyzed again.  The engine is barely broken in.
3260 2018-03-13 18:10:00 It's nice to see Arnold with Car Sense, correctly blaming the oil companies for providing the fuel for the cars that kill more than 40,000 Americans annually.
3261 2018-03-13 18:09:57 Up and coming for sure. Excuse me while I go oil my beard...
3262 2018-03-13 18:09:55 The reason Trump fired Tex is because we've already reached Peak Oil. You can read about it in my upcoming book Thermohell: Understanding History through A Modern Prism. It is my first book outside of the topic of male sexual enhancement (tho chapter 8 covers kegels exercises)
3263 2018-03-13 18:09:54 Do more drilling and bring down the prices they say. Prices come down and they're upset because oil is less than $100 a barrel so they cut production. GREED GREED GREED.

3273 2018-03-13 18:08:54 Not another bailout. Oklahoma is drowning in corruption. Vote the people’s voice. Not for corporate welfare. Get your hand out of Big Oil’s pocket and represent the OK voters.
3274 2018-03-13 18:08:54 That's the fly in the oil.  Mediocrity is the high mark to those people.  Striving to achieve that or more is an insult.

3300 2018-03-13 18:04:52 I think (and this may be a bit of a stretch, so bear with me) it's because these oil and gas companies have a ton of  that they'll use to grease someone's palms. And by someone, I mean @SecretaryZinke & by greasing his palms I mean giving him anything more than a high five.
3301 2018-03-13 18:04:51 It was to do with an oil deal that fell through with a russian company. I truly believe the deal was the last straw. When you mess with their money and the fact that trump is trying to make deals with russia, then you will be fired. It's always about money and power.

3317 2018-03-13 18:03:34 She syringes the oil into a capsule & takes it like a tablet.
3318 2018-03-13 18:03:33 Not sure; I'll have to plead ignorance on the economics of that project. My experience is on crude oil & refining.
3319 2018-03-13 18:03:20 I enjoy your tweets,So ruthless.
3320 2018-03-13 18:03:12 How's her texture.. all my kids hair take diff products. But try coconut oil for hers cause she's still young
3321 2018-03-13 18:03:08 brain uploading stuff, esp coming from modern day snake oil salesmen, is kind of a hot button issue for me, sorry
3322 2018-03-13 18:03:04 Tillerson/ peacetime president of U.S ?  As the oil man, he had the profile and connections all over. Yet the other side of Trump, a moderate at  different time. Finally came the fateful resolution, a replay of Henry Ford to Lea Iacocca. " sometime we just don't like each other."
3323 2018-03-13 18:02:57 My man got my oil changed for free  he’s been taking care of me in every way oh my lort
3324 2018-03-13 18:02:53 Err cus he was slow, poor in the air, got pushed around and turned like an oil tanker ?
3325 2018-03-13 18:02:51 oil down even weaker usd. you know how bad this is.
3326 2018-03-13 18:02:45 Nick Boles snake oil salesman.
3327 2018-03-13 18:02:44 i will only watch if there's at least five (5) instances of you hawking your snake oil per hour
3328 2018-03-13 18:02:44 Trying to pitch a ‘backwards looking’ message about big oil, coal, climate denying, etc is not where the US and the D party should be going. That is where the Trump supporters are. They shouldn’t be running on that messaging.
3329 2018-03-13 18:02:33 Wintergreen oil? I've used it to get spilt nail varnish off kitchen surfaces.
3330 2018-03-13 18:02:31 Cedar Hemp Oil 100mg (Almond)  5.0 out of stars 5                                   Cedar Hemp Oil 500mg (Ginger)
3331 2018-03-13 18:02:30 I guess we know who contributed to his campaign - @fordnation how dare you even think of turning all that money over to corporate thieves when we need this money so desperately - a Rainy Day Fund should be established - to rival Norway's trillion dollar oil fund.  DISAPPOINTED
3332 2018-03-13 18:02:23 Venezuela's failure can be attributed to a mix of corruption, falling oil prices, a heavy rely on imports and the complete failure of the state to diversify the economy (a report of the World Bank report says 96% of Venezuela's exports are oil)
3333 2018-03-13 18:02:13 @realDonaldTrump did ""NOT EVEN" use snake oil. The crap was CHEAPER without the oil!!!! AMERICA CAN DO BETTER ""WITHOUT"" @realDonaldTrump
3334 2018-03-13 18:02:08 If $OIL pushes to new lows than it will be interesting to see how the day will close...

3342 2018-03-13 18:01:23 Dear Stupid Customer,

When you come into an auto repair shop, eat the free cookies and drink the free coffee before asking for the price of an oil change, DAILY, have the decency to DRIVE A CAR HERE.

 You are fooling no one, we can see you walking from across the street. 

-CSR
3343 2018-03-13 18:01:23 I swear if I didn’t need the oil change so bad I would leave
3344 2018-03-13 18:01:19 Last I checked, free market style leagues where every team is out for themselves dont/won't work. Look at the last 25 or more years of train wreck leagues. USL survived after being like every other US league: socialist and wary of outsider snake oil salesmen.
3345 2018-03-13 18:01:15 This is a very foolish tweet nd thought.
3346 2018-03-13 18:01:13 debts are not like oil spills, failing infrastructure, or the damage done by residential schools. debts can be renegotiated, or defaulted upon and need not last generations. People can declare bankruptcy why can't the greatest power of land resolve debt?
3347 2018-03-13 18:01:05 lol, sheesh they got to make up their minds at first he was the oil devil, lol
3348 2018-03-13 18:00:56 I smell like oil from the potato chips in chemistry.
3349 2018-03-13 18:00:53 Your formal secretary of the state to came to Nigeria,to promise Mohamadu Buhari that USA will assist in making sure that Bokoharam terrorist are been wiped out, on the hand asking for oil blogs for open access to import crude self crude oil, for him self.
3350 2018-03-13 18:00:50 I’m wearing these light pink heels for the first time and I already scuffed them with oil from the gas pedal in my car 
3351 2018-03-13 18:00:48 OIL DIFF: 4.06 -> 4.11

3356 2018-03-13 18:00:20 Why???
3357 2018-03-13 18:00:14 Lots of legalities around cannabis oil. Some consultants decline to treat if using and in some forms illegal in UK. It’s an option. #choice #endoflifecare
3358 2018-03-13 18:00:11 Last time Putin got out of line oil prices went down hard and put a hurt on Russia. Wonder if they're gonna do that again.
3359 2018-03-13 18:00:10 OI could generate a lot of publicity for itself if it provided its own updates with video, I am sure a lot of people in the oil exploration/production industry would take notice.
3360 2018-03-13 18:00:09 There are people who are actually allergic to coconut oil I looked horrible I had very black marks on my face and my hair would be itchy til it I had scaring

3365 2018-03-13 17:59:54 Tillerson was valuable for the Middle East connections, not so with Iran and North Korea knowledge. Rex spent years at oil company, great executive, but not an outside-the-box thinker.
3366 2018-03-13 17:59:46 Coconut oil & Flaxseeds oil eco gel  shit is magic
3367 2018-03-13 17:59:30 Worthless $70 a barrel with extraction costs of $15 a barrel.
Remember Westminster take 90% and give Scotland 10% via the Barnett formula.
The report was hidden for 30 years to STOP independence. Westminster NEEDED to get our oil as the UK was going under in the 70s
3368 2018-03-13 17:59:13 Delivering flaxseed oil?

3378 2018-03-13 17:58:24 Yeah I have a question

How many oil tycoons expressed their interests in tickets to justify those prices?
3379 2018-03-13 17:58:22 You blacker then me with oil on my body
3380 2018-03-13 17:58:12 Welp, just pulled out my first blood feather. Poor Priscilla the Rooster kept breaking xir foot feathers, and it was bleeding everywhere. On a white chicken, that's Really Bad News. 

Also gave Prissy a nail trim and comb oil treatment. Xi's back outside now, happily crowing.
3381 2018-03-13 17:58:09 They pretty much uphold it, most nationalizations have happened in key sectors like oil, gas and telecommunications. The private sector still controlled two-thirds of the economy in 2010, the same as when Chavez took power in 1998
3382 2018-03-13 17:58:02 No it wasn’t Jane. Jay had said he was looking for somewhere to get hold of cannabis oil for his aunt. Pleased you’re getting good treatment that’s you’re happy with.

3397 2018-03-13 17:56:29 you can use natural ingredients to give nutrients to your lips. like honey as lip mask, brown sugar and olive oil as lip scrub. as for lip balm, vaseline could be a good moisturiser.
3398 2018-03-13 17:56:20 Geneva Autoshow has one big message: #energyefficiency. The amount of hybrid cars, supercars and suvs is impressive. Small producers will be crashed by the big names dominance | #energy #oil #OOTT
3399 2018-03-13 17:56:09 And to it’s because as they say. Squeaky wheel gets the oil! We’ve been to quiet, calm, time change that a little.
3400 2018-03-13 17:56:04 I mean, not really. New York, California, Texas, Florida have been economic engines that predate the Obama years. If anything Obama's policies on domestic oil and natural gas drilling has helped those flyover places.
3401 2018-03-13 17:55:50 I have really sensitive skin and can’t use a lot of face washes but i use rosehip oil for my face and little bit of ponds moisturizer so that it doesn’t get anymore irritated!!

3406 2018-03-13 17:55:07 Oil Prices swung lower as traders braced for a potential third weekly rise in U.S. crude supplies
3407 2018-03-13 17:55:04 @Big_Orrin Quick question - What is the API profle of Iran crude?  Just wondering what specific API's will be most impacted by a renewal of the Oil sanctions in May?  I'm going to guess any new sanctions will include condensate, considering US production API.
3408 2018-03-13 17:54:46 I’m back on that oil so you I know idgaf about nothing 
3409 2018-03-13 17:54:44 oil changes are the absolute worse
3410 2018-03-13 17:54:31 Don't mistake material advancement with progression as a society. They are still a repressive monarchical dictatorship propped up by oil and the west and ruthless AF.
3411 2018-03-13 17:54:15 Exxon backs out of its oil deal with Russia and now Putin fires Tillerson.   My guess is Exxon was concern about the media attention this deal got from the beginning.  Something smells here.

3415 2018-03-13 17:53:54 .@PerotJain's @JoeBeard214 says there's plenty of capital in Fort Worth and Dallas, but entrepreneurs must learn to speak the language of family offices. Talk about innovations in real estate, oil and other industries they know, he says. #SXSW #FortWorthNow
3416 2018-03-13 17:53:47 Agreed.  Classic Putin create a problem & come in as a savior.  Wouldn't put it pass Putin to have assisted in NK nuclear weapons.  Hell recent sanctions were placed on NK & any countires assisting, except Russia.  It was reported earlier a Russian tanker delivered oil offshore.
3417 2018-03-13 17:53:43 Rex is gonna drill oil beneath WH
3418 2018-03-13 17:53:25 So if Mr. X pumps up the price of oil/gas artificially just cause he has the money and influence and you die of pneumonia cause you could not afford heating. We will call it a fair game and just tell ourselves that is how things work?
3419 2018-03-13 17:53:23 I recommend macadamia oil by out of africa. :) 
you can also mix with glycerine like 1:4 parts glycerine to macadamia oil on your palm - the glycerine acts as a toner and pulls humidity from the air to keep your skin moisturized.
3420 2018-03-13 17:53:19 If they are full if aspartame yes! Get some #CBD oil and #ashwaganda and you'll be find 
3421 2018-03-13 17:53:17 Coconut oil: obviously made from coconuts. Olive oil: obviously made from olives. Emu oil: HOLY SHIT THeY MAKE THAT OUT oF eMUS?
3422 2018-03-13 17:53:17 Roman is an oil crook
3423 2018-03-13 17:53:10 Weird how comments are never quite as cheery as the initial oil tweets. I guess people hate being robbed by a commodity that has cornered the market for 100yrs.and violently oppressed renewables.
3424 2018-03-13 17:53:08 That's probably true.  But it doesn't change the fact that a lot of these people had concerns, felt they were being ignored, and were charmed by a snake oil salesman.  We should not write them off.  I don't mean the gun-toting racists, obviously.
3425 2018-03-13 17:53:02 I still mad at Smashburger for not having cheese fries. 

I can make those fries they serve now at home: truffle oil, rosemary, coarse kosher salt, black pepper. Drop 'em. Done
3426 2018-03-13 17:52:33 Palm oil of all things. Cheap to manufacture, an absolute travesty to human health @WHO RIP our world environment, thanks to greed and corruption.
3427 2018-03-13 17:52:31 don’t wanna pay for this oil change tomorrow but have no other choice 
3428 2018-03-13 17:52:30 Look at that, liberal media is actually defending a republican oil executive for getting fired. Didn't know liberals had such an affinity for oil billionaires.
3429 2018-03-13 17:52:29 على الاخر 
3430 2018-03-13 17:52:19 Bert ... And your article referred to which period? The relatively small amount of oil traded to Turkish business people by ISIS terminated long before the trade with the regime ended (because ISIS lost access to oil wells destroyed by US) or largely captured by Kurds.
3431 2018-03-13 17:52:08 I live in Sage Grouse Country....Call me "Country" but, I'd rather have a Flock of Sage Grouse for Neighbors than Oil Fields!!! Time to WAKE UP America!!!

3436 2018-03-13 17:51:50 What did you think ExxonMobil was? 

They're the Rockefeller's oil company, Exxon and Mobil formerly Standard Oil of New Jersey and New York, respectively. They re-merged in 1999, 2 years before 9/11. 

The Twin Towers were built by the Rockefeller brothers too.
3437 2018-03-13 17:51:45 Hardly - well I guess you never know but thinking that he will 'set the record' for this, thanking the Idiot for opportunity to serve stating that Pompeo will rock [NOT] but what he's thinking he will be tucking into the OIL deals he has set up this last year
3438 2018-03-13 17:51:43 have you tried meditading? or try putting a small amount of balm oil on your top, the smell calms you down and makes your heart stop beating so heavily

3440 2018-03-13 17:51:11 Oil change, tire rotation, air filters swapped and all the good shit.
3441 2018-03-13 17:51:11 Well, I like Rex. I like his tenure in the oil industry and his professionalism.

3443 2018-03-13 17:50:50 @caveofbeauty i read somewhere that lemongrass oil is good for removing black heads and lime oil is good for removing age spots. Is it true ? Also can carrot seed oil really fight free radicals and pollution ? I read that it can be used as an spf.

3446 2018-03-13 17:50:46 Trump is responsible for foreign countries purchasing US coal. Deregulation also contributes to growth and sustainability along with tax cuts when the opposite burdened the industry. Coal industry is used to produce electrical energy. Oil & Coal are the most used for energy in US

3448 2018-03-13 17:50:20 I know who PKK and YPG are.  I know that they have sacrificed their lives to defeat ISIS while your troops did nothing and you bought oil from ISIS ... I know you attack American servicemen in your country and that you support radical Islam ... You are no #NATO country
3449 2018-03-13 17:50:17 Is this a long or a short con Joe? Eh? What do you want? Money? Gifts? More time to write? The deed to those oil derricks? What are you gonna do about Max? YOU COULD’VE HAD IT ALL

3456 2018-03-13 17:49:33 There are articles on YouTube explaining how to distill your own THC cannabis oil. However, you have to buy illegal leaf first. As 75% of UK street cannabis is now skunk it may be better to grow your own. That’s why it should be legalised.
3457 2018-03-13 17:49:26 .@SecretaryZinke isn’t listening to Oregonians – or any American who appreciates our natural treasures. Oil and gas executives are the only folks who seem to have his ear.

3466 2018-03-13 17:48:12 I had them Ali and it was awful. Had to soak them off with castor oil and then use rapid lash to repair my lashes. You are much better off with a decent mascara
3467 2018-03-13 17:48:09 after finding a reputable company, i ordered some full spectrum cbd oil in hopes to ease anxiety for both steven and i
3468 2018-03-13 17:48:08 I need to do a clean air mod. Oil is coming out during wheelies and getting on the nut holding the cable in place, making it come loose and the theottlw cable keeps coming out. I put lock tight for now 
3469 2018-03-13 17:48:02 Your article dates January 2017. At the time ISIS operated from Palmyra indeed, but the regime has ousted them there and has recovered the oil route themselves. ISIS is not more needed.
3470 2018-03-13 17:47:44 Tillerson is an oil man... North Korea needs Basketball skills? Idiocy? Yes men? Trumps oil deals wouldda been too obvious so guess Tillerson is no longer needed- with the narcissist- no needy -bye bye in a second.
3471 2018-03-13 17:47:39 Yes. Light distillates are gasoline and naphtha whole heavy are Fuel oil and the rest of the bottom of the barrel
3472 2018-03-13 17:47:37 Guess I’ll go get my oil changed 
3473 2018-03-13 17:47:20 I'm old enough to remember when Rex Tillerson was supposedly an evil, rich oil man who was too close to the Russians to ever be trusted. Now CNN loves him.
3474 2018-03-13 17:47:00 Plus, now he is clear to make that North Sea oil deal for his Rusky b*tch! Happy days are here again ol’ Rexy!
3475 2018-03-13 17:46:48 Stay the hell our of Colorado's business, we do not want you or your oil buddies here.
3476 2018-03-13 17:46:39 there's nothing really medicinal about it.  it's just treating your skin really nicely.  ours has beeswax, coconut oil, cocoa butter, olive oil, lavender oil, and rosemary oil in it.  that's all.  but you can omit and substitute as necessary.
3477 2018-03-13 17:46:38 Now's the perfect opportunity, Greenpeace!  How about an international campaign to "keep that dirty high-carbon oil IN THE GROUND!"  Well?  (Get it?  Well?  Sigh.)
3478 2018-03-13 17:46:37 Does your term middle distillates mean jet fuel, diesel, and heating oil?
3479 2018-03-13 17:46:29 Usually it was meant for placing an oil lamp those days !
3480 2018-03-13 17:46:13 Stop buying oil 
- to drive your car
- to cook your food
Eventually, you can stop the funding for our beloved club. 
Not sure you would have won anything by then though.
3481 2018-03-13 17:46:13 Oooo alright I went to the ratchet place past price cutters lmao there was a chicken outside . It was chill  I just gotta oil change tho
3482 2018-03-13 17:46:09 There is nothing honorable or heroic about killing Iraqi children in the name of oil.

3484 2018-03-13 17:45:59 The departure of #Tillerson for the #oil market:
• Much harder line on #Iran sactions
• Siding with #SaudiArabia and #UAE on #Qatar crisis
• Harder line on #Venezuela 
• Not much change on #climatechange
• Easier relations with #Russia

3501 2018-03-13 17:44:09 I eagerly await the application of this new “If you don’t own an X, you don’t get to regulate X” principle to oil refineries or explosives manufacturers.
3502 2018-03-13 17:43:53 They don’t have as many people living off of “assistance”. In 2017 it was about 1 million. Oil prices and immigrants are straining the system. Multiply x’s 60 and you get the US. 28% of migrants in Norway get aid. 2017 was not good and the system is in trouble

3520 2018-03-13 17:42:34 I strongly hold the opinion that Africa can be independent. We don't have to import from China. We're busy building the west at our expense. Kenya is the largest tea and coffee exporter, but we spend more to acquire less than what an American gets. Nigeria produces oil.
3521 2018-03-13 17:42:30 Groupon very clutch RT @TheOTAPShow: Groupon stay coming through with the oil change deals.
3522 2018-03-13 17:42:29 When you think of Canadian oil, you think of Alberta. What are you doing about the pipeline? @RachelNotley
3523 2018-03-13 17:42:21 I kinda liked Rex Tillerson mainly because it was so ridiculous that an oil baron was Secretary of State. Mike Pompeo is a shitty person and I hope he gets fired soon.
3524 2018-03-13 17:42:17 Now they can feel how Alberta does with Oil

3531 2018-03-13 17:41:54 It's China's call as global Buyer-of-Last-Resort. They have c1bn barrels of ammunition to back up a benchmark war. If I were them I'd switch my liquidity from ICE/CME to what resembles a quasi-LME cleared oil forwards market #OOTT

3535 2018-03-13 17:41:31 Russia probably did pick Tillerson for the Exxon/Rosneft oil deal, but that fell through and Rex turned out to be somewhat qualified for the job so he’s out
3536 2018-03-13 17:41:29 When are you gonna stop putting palm oil in Nutella sold in UK you don't on mainland Europe.
3537 2018-03-13 17:41:16 They are. I'm a firm believer cannabis oil helps people for all sorts of medical issues, cancer being one of them. 
There's already a cure I reckon but it'll never come out as the government & pharmaceuticals make tons of money from it.
3538 2018-03-13 17:41:08 Now everyone ... #FakeNewsMedia & congress & pundits ... claim they all liked Rex Tillerson .... as opposed to the Oil Company Exec who they said didn't know nothing about diplomacy or State Dept ... they love him !
3539 2018-03-13 17:41:00 If you have any left over sauté it with a bit of onion, olive oil and stock. Makes awesome soup.
3540 2018-03-13 17:40:56 I do a coconut oil mask, it helps
3541 2018-03-13 17:40:55 Is this...

Oil?

You wonder what happened in here. Where's your DAD?
3542 2018-03-13 17:40:54 Bottom line is the lady has stage 4. She’s not, and never will be cured of her cancer. Cannabis oil is perhaps helping with symptom management only.

3548 2018-03-13 17:40:06 To be fair, I know people who use Young Living essential oils and others using doTERRA, who don't actively sell them to others and affirm their efficacy. Melaleuca oil is an essential oil.
3549 2018-03-13 17:40:02 If you're out of shaving cream, use olive oil. It works just as good, if not better.

3556 2018-03-13 17:39:23 Probably one of the smartest men Trump had in his cabinet.  He probably doesn't mind, defiantly didn't need the money.  Plus he didn't give him the people to help carry out what/how he needed to do his job.  Even though he came from the oil biz he wasn't a climate change denier.
3557 2018-03-13 17:39:14 Dude, c'mon. At least warn em that the slippery bastard coats himself in baby oil. That was an unwelcome surprise, and one hell of a carpet cleaning bill.
3558 2018-03-13 17:39:11 Why are tax dollars funding the removal of ships from harbours? Is this not the owner's responsibility? Seems to be the same as the Alberta Government funding removal of oil wells which is complete BS.

Its hard to remember that we are & have been an oil producing nation. Where did the riches go? Why isn't fuel dirt cheap like other OPEC nations?
3570 2018-03-13 17:38:33 Hahaha thats what you call loyalty when these oil rich bastards have given up hope of signing him even with all their money.

3573 2018-03-13 17:38:16 So The President is going to fire the nation’s leading diplomat, who was previously the CEO of an oil and gas corporation, and you’re going to replace him with the Director of CIA, an intelligence official, who is also unqualified to United States Secretary of State.
3574 2018-03-13 17:38:14 If there's not already an overheard in Houston account there needs to be. Mine from yesterday: "think of Rick Perry as the Billy Graham of oil and gas"
3575 2018-03-13 17:38:12 Breaking controversial news:
“Fossil fuels” are not made of organic combustion as theorized in 1556. We continue to only find more, it’s not running out. We reached peak oil in the 1920’s?! No. This is a dumb old theory. It’s natural from the earth.
3576 2018-03-13 17:38:09 And coal, and natural gas, and hydro, and nuclear and oil have applications in most geographies also. Let's make the right economic / environmental decisions. One size does not fit all, everywhere.
3577 2018-03-13 17:38:06 you could have just said yes
3578 2018-03-13 17:38:00 Complete BS.  Cars started rusting after 2 or 3 years, leaking oil about 80,000 miles.  Expensive repairs like ring jobs and valve replacements were common. In the 60s, cars would wheeze to 100K miles if lucky.  Now the average is 8 years and 200K.

3580 2018-03-13 17:37:40 Who has said that the supply chain approach is the whole answer to Colombia's deforestation? But it should indeed be part of the equation. And companies need to perform their due diligence on their suppliers, be that palm oil, dairy or beef. No matter if it's for national market.
3581 2018-03-13 17:37:38 At which point, the *rest* of the world goes "Oh shit"

3582 2018-03-13 17:37:34 How exactly are we in his pocket? And if he is, good! He is booming our economy and creating jobs. He is also allowing us to drill in ANWAR, when his country’s only export is oil..... The Russians must be ecstatic!
3583 2018-03-13 17:37:28 With all that oil money, few weeks ago, it was impossible to watch "Black Panther" in Yenagoa. Not fair to deny young people this level of inspiration.
3584 2018-03-13 17:37:19 Exxon holds drilling rights to MILLIONS OF ACRES in Russia.  It can’t access them because we don’t want Russia to modernize its oil infrastructure. We drop sanctions and BAM it’s a TRILLION dollar deal!  Trump wants in.

3593 2018-03-13 17:35:59 He wants them to keep pumping oil but he wants them to feel bad about it. He wants them ashamed. He doesn’t want lines at the gas station, he doesn’t want poor single mothers to not being able to go to their jobs because there’s no gas. He just wants companies humiliated... lame

3600 2018-03-13 17:34:48 NOKO, Iran Deal both stakes are so high. I understand why Tillerson lost his job despite his outstanding resume as CEO ExxonMobile whose vast conx in oil biz is no match. But his CEO experience didnt translate well into high demand job as Trump's SoS who must deal w/ Kim & Iran

3604 2018-03-13 17:34:35 Only reason is because ND has oil, most of the people living there are temporary. So what about the other 49 states?

3607 2018-03-13 17:34:24 Foreign policy hawks should support a higher gas tax. A little downward pressure on world oil prices (from reduced US consumption) would hit quite a few unfriendly countries and their oligarchs in the wallet.

3623 2018-03-13 17:33:13 This makes me think about the book the moral case for fossil fuel. In it the author explain exactly what Arnold is doing. Arnold doesn’t want the oil companies to stop pumping oil. Because if they do millions of poor people will lose their jobs.

3665 2018-03-13 17:29:39 All these Trumpsters seem to be linked through the Kochs, the Mercers, and Russian oil oligarchs, and profit takes precedence over loyalty to country.

3668 2018-03-13 17:29:29 Name a worthy brand that actually sells full gram cartridges tho

All the ones I've ever seen, the tank is either built shitty, oil has shitty addidtives, tastes like reggie or all of the above.

Seems like the folks buying full grams are the ones getting hustled tbh

3673 2018-03-13 17:29:14 I’m just gonna say 30 gallons of a 42 gallon barrel of oil is refined into gas and diesel. Solar panels would reduce demand for oil by ~3 galllons/barrel ( the amount able to be refined into HGL and heavy oil for power/heating ).

3676 2018-03-13 17:29:03 Now that Putin has fired Rex, Secretary of Oil, I sure hope the dying party of the #republicans realizes their dereliction of duties will come back to bite them in November 2018. #maga #MakeAmericaGoAway
3677 2018-03-13 17:29:00 #rex faithfully fulfilled his duties... 

which were to work out ‘financial deals’ on who gets ‘last oil’... & will be responsible for even more global warming... 

the 1 percent will all benefit from his patriot-ism.

there is nothing mor for him to do.
3678 2018-03-13 17:28:45 It would be ironic if global warming resulted in a new glaciation. When the Russians were drilling in the Arctic Ocean for oil they discovered that it was largely ice-free during the last glaciation but that was put in the inconvenient facts box.
3679 2018-03-13 17:28:43 Rex Tillerson was fired and I’ve been screaming “He’s an oil man!” Plainview-style to myself all morning.
3680 2018-03-13 17:28:39 Is it globalist or just the pursuit for better cheaper oil? Or are they the same thing?

3686 2018-03-13 17:28:19 But Congressman Swellwell i thought you said Tillerson was going to do the big oil deals for Trump?
3687 2018-03-13 17:28:18 1950's America needs Allies because cold War, spend $$$$$$$$ on "free trade" because say... the Big Three are much *less* critical than a non-Communist Japan and also provides the Navy to make it work _for free_.  1970's is that plus "Oh shit, now we import oil too" . 1/4(?)

3693 2018-03-13 17:27:57 The big problem is that you are getting rid of professional employees who care about conservation & don't put top priority to energy dominance. You are destroying professionalism at Interior. You are keeping employees who are LOYAL--to mining, oil, & ranchers industries.
3694 2018-03-13 17:27:51 Trumps promised to "make America great"???!!! yet, homeless line the streets for miles in Cali. The official position on every issue is inaction.

3714 2018-03-13 17:25:57 No, you’re right. I’m sure oil wells up and down the coast, drilling in our national parks and of course “bringing back coal” will be great for preserving nature.

3724 2018-03-13 17:25:23 でもこういうのは量より質なんだよなぁ
3725 2018-03-13 17:25:22 I can't help but think this shakeup was part of plan. Russia sanctions are off, Rex gutted SoS. Now he'll go back to Exxon, join with Rosneft then they can proceed on their trillion $ deal to extract oil in the Arctic and elsewhere.
3726 2018-03-13 17:25:19 Yes because Notley totally has a magic jobs wand and took everyone's jobs away magically.....or maybe it was the precipitous drop in the price of oil? Take off the tinfoil hat Margaret.
3727 2018-03-13 17:25:16 10 days for an oil change and a new ac compressor from @CovertFordLinc needless to say I’ll never be taking my car back to be serviced there. Second time in less than a year my car has been in the shop for more than 5 days for something so small.
3728 2018-03-13 17:25:10 I will crowdfund for a donut scout oil painting
3729 2018-03-13 17:25:08 Researchers concluded that olive oil’s higher levels of monounsaturated oleic and palmitoleic acids accounted for its advantages in wound treatment.

3732 2018-03-13 17:24:53 Don’t you hate when you go to get a simple oil change and need a wheel alignment, tire rotation, inspection and a brake light is out...
3733 2018-03-13 17:24:52 Why I don't watch the News. A Oil Man replaced by a CIA Man. Wow We're Doomed. 

3734 2018-03-13 17:24:46 Rex is taking the oil out of the "well-oiled machine"
3735 2018-03-13 17:24:45 i actually have olive oil but it's fancy so i'd rather die than ever use it

3738 2018-03-13 17:24:36 Snake oil salesman Schiff just wants continue 2 waste taxpayer $ on this BS. If they R so sure of collusion, they need 2 fund investigation n2 DNC, HRC, DOJ, FBI. NEthing Trump MIGHT have done wd supposedly come out n THAT investigation, but they don't have the juevos to do that.
3739 2018-03-13 17:24:35 The only upgrade that I like but still don’t do is the high mileage oil.
3740 2018-03-13 17:24:30 @PepcoLuc I have documents from Pepco that can prove, that this company tried to defraud us of our hard earned money. Pepco is seeking payment for an oil delivery,that was never delivered !!! Contact Bonnie Charles for info on acct no. 50246025  .

3746 2018-03-13 17:23:24 They never cared for democracy, exactly like Libya. They don't even care about the Syrian people or US would return oil to them. I hope the Kurds get out of Afrin for now and come back with everything they have alongside SAA but we will see, I doubt it will unfold exactly as that

3748 2018-03-13 17:23:03 Well since Exxon-Mobil is no longer doing the deal with Rosneft to drill for Russian oil and putting Russia out there it’s bye bye time.
3749 2018-03-13 17:23:02 When the former oil company CEO with a long history of working with Russia and putting profit above the fate of the world has a stronger moral code than the President...
3750 2018-03-13 17:23:01 Unlike myself, my opponent wants an America where rich oil companies and racists can corrupt our hard-working families.
3751 2018-03-13 17:22:41 Horrible service department. Simple oil change. One hour wait turned into a two and half hour wait and they didn’t even have the car in their computer yet. Left with no oil change. Terrible dealership.
3752 2018-03-13 17:22:41 I hope @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has learned his lesson. No more big oil, big investment firm globalist needed for any job in his cabinet or his administration. Only men and women who are 100% in on #MAGA.

3754 2018-03-13 17:22:27 Stewart is the correct choice vs the oil imo
3755 2018-03-13 17:22:24 3 Stanley Cups Bob and a contract that was signed when Toews had major UFA years ahead.  Not remotely the same in my opinion. Would agree I would have signed it if I was 29, but the Oil had full control of this process.
3756 2018-03-13 17:22:22 Oh, well. Back to the oil rig.
3757 2018-03-13 17:22:07 What about Canadian oil. It also drives the Canadian economy.
3758 2018-03-13 17:21:57 3 fkn hours just to change the oil from my car .. fkn kidding me bro
3759 2018-03-13 17:21:51 Shout out to the guy whose headshot I just used as a funnel to put oil in my car.
3760 2018-03-13 17:21:43 I would be more proud when you stop using oil for ever.
3761 2018-03-13 17:21:34 Bizarrely not, though it needs to be oil free. Spray on and rub hard. My friend had the same on her carpet and after a good rub it came off
3762 2018-03-13 17:21:28 to be fair Dewar himself arranged the biggest power grab pre #Brexit by giving a huge chunk of our fishing waters and a few oil fields over to England the night before Holyrood opened
3763 2018-03-13 17:21:16 Or Petroleum is that Oil or Petrol?
3764 2018-03-13 17:21:12 Rex Tillerson was a well-connected Exxon CEO who was hoping for a deal to drill for oil in Siberia. This firing was incredibly disrespectful to Putin.
3765 2018-03-13 17:21:00 Cats, you have to love them! She wasn't to thrilled about cleaning the oil paint off her paws!
3766 2018-03-13 17:20:54 Rex Tillerson will finally more time to be a crotchety oil tycoon in a ten gallon hat
3767 2018-03-13 17:20:47 I bet he made a few of oil deals for his cohorts, though. Every one of 45's picks had an agenda that was counter govt. I never realized it was so easy for a crooked admin to seize power and screw us all.
3768 2018-03-13 17:20:38 Because Tillerson is an Establishment Shill who won't work with DJT. Only reason he was sent in was to expand Oil for Exxon/Mobile and he failed.
Pompeo has shown allegiance to work together for DJT instead of against him imho.
3769 2018-03-13 17:20:36 Whether it's Tillerson or Pompeo at the State Dept. is not the issue. It's the oil soaked and war mongering policies that these administration pursues that are at the heart of the struggle to resist every policy this administration puts forward.
3770 2018-03-13 17:20:28 Lmaooo it’s just coconut oil and water

3772 2018-03-13 17:19:56 Smart move, some questions you can't win on, Trump lied so much he gave a new meaning to the word, promise tax cuts, create more jobs for coal & steel & oil and you will be elected, don't have to do it, just say it.  HRC had the better financial plan but no one was listening.
3773 2018-03-13 17:19:54 Did you Know that Moringa  Oil is loaded  with skin-supporting  nutrients, anti  oxidants, vitamins  A, B, C,D, E  & K, essential fatty  acids Omega  3, 6, 9 and copper  to name a few;  making Olio Arie the  optimal  defense against  environmental stressors.

3780 2018-03-13 17:19:10 The Egyptian  Pharaohs assured the presence of a vial of Moringa   Oil in their tomb  due to its powerful  essence. It is proudly the main  carrier oil found  in Olio Arie. It is  super high in Oleic Acid (over  72%) providing  advanced properties of  healing and hydration.
3781 2018-03-13 17:18:51 Oklahoma GOP lawmakers won't do anything that offends either Trump, the NRA, or big oil! But November is looming and, if the state's special election results are a barometer, change is coming! That's why the GOP led legislature is ramming thru all kinds of ridiculous legislation.
3782 2018-03-13 17:18:50 Moringa Oil is little known in the West. It comes from the Moringa tree  which is also known as the  “Miracle Tree” and the “Tree of Life”.  It  was esteemed for its  miraculous healing properties in Ancient Egypt and  Greece.

3791 2018-03-13 17:18:01 I am told toothpaste is the thing to get marker out of wool, assuming the carpet is wool? Permanent marker is oil-based so you need to break down the oil, my personal guess is alcohol would be best for that. Have you tried methylated spirit? Or anti-bac hand stuff? Good luck.

3797 2018-03-13 17:17:07 I have no idea why a former oil man was not successful with foreign policy on behalf of a real estate developer and TV host.

3837 2018-03-13 17:12:35 Rex Tillerson was a brilliant CEO of an oil company. Why would someone so smart & successful want to work for our dotard leader? No one with any sanity, dignity, intelligence, & decency would want to be involved with this bastard. He’ll be removed soon. This can’t continue. SAD!

3855 2018-03-13 17:10:59 Tillerson was close to Putin from his time doing oil deals with Exxon so that was a stick to beat Trump with on Russia collusion; now, because he has supposedly become anti-Russia his dismissal has been recycled to highlight collusion! 180 degree turn but same narrative!
3856 2018-03-13 17:10:51 Rex Tillerson is out of the WH, and BTW: When first heard about him, without knowing the guy, I thought "hmm, that name sounds like the evil oil executive that wants to destroy the youth center in an 80's movie".
3857 2018-03-13 17:10:48 Now back in 08 when Obama won! They set out to distroy him! McConnell said they would make him a one time President! TREASON brought to you by Koch!The pipeline leaked already over 200k gallions! They own the Republican Party! They all need to go down GOP for allowing it Oil 4 it
3858 2018-03-13 17:10:45 Oil is pouring from Saudi Arabia.
3859 2018-03-13 17:10:38 That shit nasty if you can boil them you can easily make them with some oil in a pot bro lol
3860 2018-03-13 17:10:20 Same sis . People outchea telling you about coconut oil and tumaric powder hmmmm
3861 2018-03-13 17:10:19 UK was illegally in charged of oil in Biafra land with their allied, Muslim northern nigeria for 50yrs. Biafra wants America be in charge for 100yrs but let Jewish Biafra be free from Islamic nigeria govt. #BuildTheWall #MAGA
Free Biafra
3862 2018-03-13 17:10:16 Hes going to work on the big oil deal from the outside
3863 2018-03-13 17:10:11 Why would Tillerson,  in a primo position to help usa big oil ... decide to leave?  And please don't pretend that trump controls anything.  Everyone he contracts has so much on him they get whatever they want.
3864 2018-03-13 17:10:08 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
3865 2018-03-13 17:10:06 Yikes! On smaller rashes Oregano oil brought me some relief due to its anti-microbial properties, but probably not a good choice for the face.
3866 2018-03-13 17:09:53 Coconut milk or olive oil for my hair...what are we talking about
3867 2018-03-13 17:09:36 Lucas Oil Jr.
3868 2018-03-13 17:09:28 Then her aunt was as I've served you, you've never poured oil on our hinges; there in such an awfully thick one! The Baba

3870 2018-03-13 17:09:20 yeah i do have sesame oil, sesame seeds, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic salt, so i do have some of the essentials
3871 2018-03-13 17:09:20 Si es gas oil contaminan. No sería mejor la energía eólica y la solar??!!!
3872 2018-03-13 17:09:11 Tillerson was only chosen to help the 500B oil deal once sanctions were lifted.

3874 2018-03-13 17:08:56 Oh!!! Okay. Yeah I’m not sure what works best for your type of hair but @JmosDocGal might! She said coconut oil is really good I think. 
3875 2018-03-13 17:08:51 One thing leading to another :) Prob. will soon see KRG delivering oil via SOMO.
3876 2018-03-13 17:08:45 I heard a lady in real life casually comment that anyone LGBTQ is gross bcause someone on tv was talking about his husband. So here I am sitting here getting my oil changed just being gross I guess #lgbt #shessogross
3877 2018-03-13 17:08:44 I’m a bit of a bystander during this strike. I work in Norwegian academia where my pension is safe (until the oil runs out?). But I’ve fully supported UK academics from the start & they are surely right to hold out for a better deal. International solidarity!
3878 2018-03-13 17:08:39 the Oil spills. 
3879 2018-03-13 17:08:35 West Virginia with steel, coal and oil.  Also, moonshine.
3880 2018-03-13 17:08:31 Mr @MarkFieldUK does the government have any duty towards British Citizens? Or does it depend on media coverage and publicity and presence of oil and trade deals etc?
3881 2018-03-13 17:08:29 I am so disappointed by your continuing support of the #KinderMorgan pipeline. This is the dirtiest kind of oil extraction, sets back Canada's commitment to stop climate change, and violates the rights of the First Peoples.  @JustinTrudeau -  #StopKM #ProtecttheInlet
3882 2018-03-13 17:08:25 Labour could take the economy of an Arab oil state and make it collapse in a single term. They ruin everything they touch. @lbc

3884 2018-03-13 17:08:10 Hats off to @cenkuygur and @TheYoungTurks for predicting #Tillerson leaving following collapse of $9 trill oil deal with Russia. You guys just earned a very interested subscriber

3886 2018-03-13 17:08:01 LRT lmao this is me i hate oil it terrifies me especially when my fried food starts hissing
3887 2018-03-13 17:07:55 The fact that Trump made a representative of Big Oil recoil at his political positions is completely terrifying.
3888 2018-03-13 17:07:54 If you pitched a movie with a villain who was a former oil executive from Texas named Rex Tillerson, it would probably be rejected for being too stereotypical.
3889 2018-03-13 17:07:46 Collusion is between Russian Oligarchs, American Billionaires, and Other International Billionaires who have no loyalty to any countries.

Tillerson failed to get the sanctions lifted from the potential TRILLIONS in OIL deals.
3890 2018-03-13 17:07:45 Would be interested to know the difference if she had taken the legal cbd oil rather than oil with the thc in it. Either way it should be legalized.
3891 2018-03-13 17:07:39 I wish G was here to put oil in my car  I really hate going under my hood , my hands be all dirty lol
3892 2018-03-13 17:07:39 Bought this moisturizer it feels good when I first put it on but now my face is so oil  no me gusta
3893 2018-03-13 17:07:34 Hey Neil I’ve only been using it since Friday morning but I really do feel that the oil has given me some relief, I’m not as wheezy and not coughing as much, for €6 I’d say try it for you and your son :)
3894 2018-03-13 17:07:30 And we have done well with all of those powers but the economy, monetary policy, international trade and development, financial services, immigration, oil and gas including many others. If we had these powers in Scotland we could grow the economy much more than we can now
3895 2018-03-13 17:07:28 in desperate need of an oil diffuser since mine shattered 
3896 2018-03-13 17:07:28 He's not clean! He has profited in the millions from oil deals. He wants to look that way.

3898 2018-03-13 17:07:20 Need my oil changed asap
3899 2018-03-13 17:07:15 Wow @google isn't fucking bias at all

Search 'total government subsidies per year'

Heavy bias against Oil and Tesla in results. What about education, farms, Healthcare, financial grants, housing bubble with loans anyone?

Yet less than 1 million in fed salaries, budget cut meme
3900 2018-03-13 17:07:15 I wonder if Tillerson will go back to dumping oil in the ocean
3901 2018-03-13 17:07:12 Citation for that in humans? @DrRobertOConnor @drg1985 are you aware of evidence that Cancer rates are higher on high carb & high seed oil diets?
3902 2018-03-13 17:07:10 well I don't think the Russians are going to be happy with him so heading up a oil company is most likely out
3903 2018-03-13 17:06:40 Three slash four cup vegetable oil.
3904 2018-03-13 17:06:37 This oil got my beard looking shiny 
3905 2018-03-13 17:06:35 And like that, Tillerson sailed off into the sunset... on an oil barge, spilling Exxon as he goes.
3906 2018-03-13 17:06:31 You could potentially still make it, but it would be harder. Fried squash is still delicious. Slice it kinda thin. Butter(or oil) the pan. Add the squash, some onion or garlic, salt, pepper, maybe some meat. Finish with melting cheese on top. Its good
3907 2018-03-13 17:06:28 May scrape off that oil painting that is taking weeks (and months) to dry. Got enough old credit cards to use for it. And rubber gloves.
3908 2018-03-13 17:06:14 What explains this trend? Many multinationals have a massive footprint in countries like Poland or Czech Republic due to low-cost manpower but these countries are not on the list yet. These companies include tech giants like google and facebook, oil & gas like Exxonmobil etc.

3919 2018-03-13 17:05:21 rex tillerson will return to his day job, randomly firing a shotgun on his property in the hopes of discovering some bubbling crude, oil that is, black gold, texas tea
3920 2018-03-13 17:05:15 Just like the tobacco industry fully supported research into root causes of lung cancer, but opposed using tax dollars to promote smoking cessation. Or the oil and gas industry, which fully supports climate research but opposes limiting carbon emissions. #NRABoycott

3922 2018-03-13 17:05:12 Comme "Big Oil" c'est vous qui l'avez sorti, je ne sais pas trop quoi mettre dedans, je dois bien dire.
D'où le fait que j'utilise majoritairement d'autres termes, vous remarquerez.
3923 2018-03-13 17:04:55 And that’s why I’m glad my haircare brand doesn’t use palm oil. Plus it’s vegan and not tested on animals :D I absolutely LOVE it
3924 2018-03-13 17:04:50 
3925 2018-03-13 17:04:48 The Security State & Big Oil killed JFK, right? So who did Trump fire? Just thinking out loud here. LOL
3926 2018-03-13 17:04:45 There is no scientific evidence that #cannabis cures #cancer in living, breathing human beings, largely because the research hasn't been done. If I was diagnosed I'd certainly try cannabis oil but I wouldn't stop conventional treatments
3927 2018-03-13 17:04:43 Love Grilled Fennel!  Slice down the middle, olive oil and grill.
3928 2018-03-13 17:04:35 This is a daily occurrence at City Deep JHB market. Staff member had to bribe a a “metro” R 100 to not remove a disk for a small oil leak.
3929 2018-03-13 17:04:28 How about some Backwoods and some African pride oil? 
3930 2018-03-13 17:04:25 My hair hates coconut oil, what did avocado oil do?
3931 2018-03-13 17:04:23 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.

3934 2018-03-13 17:04:10 Kind of like how Rumsfeld assumed the war in Iraq would be short and pay for itself with oil revenues

3939 2018-03-13 17:03:49 I just don’t understand I’ve been here since 10:30 it doesn’t take that long to do an oil change and rotate my tires
3940 2018-03-13 17:03:46 I'm using the sample of face oil from my birchbox and so far it's made my face very soft which is good but the softness is making me touch my face all the time which is probably bad
3941 2018-03-13 17:03:24 I am sad to see such competent person as Mr Tillerson leave the US government. Remember he led the biggest and most succesfull oil company of the US before for many years
3942 2018-03-13 17:03:19 The oil trading tips from Rexxon "Mobi" Tillerson have sucked. Jared lost next month's mortgage money following that newsletter.
3943 2018-03-13 17:03:16 Stop the Fu*king Insanity:President Trump and his Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke are abolishing some of our most cherished national monuments, one by one, so their friends in the oil and gas industry can profit off the destruction of America's public lands.
3944 2018-03-13 17:03:15 Russia was not Ypg ally. Russian only ally is Syrian government. Turkey is Nato country and US could have easily stop them but choose not to. US wants Turkey to clash with Russia but Russia wont do it if they dont gain what US now holds.. oil and gas east from euphrates
3945 2018-03-13 17:03:11 Don't just rush like others to enter the marriage and then when the time comes, you seek extra oil like the five foolish virgins. Make yourself ready. When the groom will come... He'll have no time to wait for you...

3946 2018-03-13 17:03:03 This is perfect timing. I have pretty much nearly all the ingredients. I assume you can use regular oil??

3950 2018-03-13 17:02:36 Don't be duped by TRex. He did not suddenly turn into Russia's enemy. He made oil deals with Russia while Vlad watched. He proudly wears the medal of friendship around his neck
3951 2018-03-13 17:02:34 .@RexTillersonWH don’t forget to steal sum White House towels on yr way out. good for getting oil off yr hands! Still use mine from a WH tour i took in ‘87

3953 2018-03-13 17:02:27 Do they have an annual capacity for 150,000,000 bbl of Oil, even then need $100/ bbl... I’d say it’s on its way again...
3954 2018-03-13 17:02:15 Olive oil &amp; garlic are my go-to! You can sauté meat, fish and veggies in it and not feel any guilt! Good for u and GREAT flavor.
3955 2018-03-13 17:02:08 i don't even know where liberals can point to the time when they told some conservative "well if you look at section five, paragraph b, it clearly states ... x" and some oil lobbyist just had to shrug and give a town their water back

3961 2018-03-13 17:01:35 It wasn’t obvious to you that Tillerson’s time was up?? The $8 TRILLION (projected revenue) oil deal with Russia failed so he had no reason left to be there. It was the entire purpose of his hiring.
3962 2018-03-13 17:01:30 Well heres a first, people actually feeling sorry for an oil company executive
3963 2018-03-13 17:01:26 Seriously? Crushing economic sanctions, destroying their oil income w our prod, wiping out over 400 of their special forces in Syria, sending arms to Ukraine, reinforcing Romania and Bulgaria, etc. Do you pay attention to world events or just parrot Democrat talking points?

3971 2018-03-13 17:00:41 Russia had dropped the dollar  this is what it’s about, Oil is no longer valued in dollars by the following countries... Iraq, Syria, Libya and also Iran...... also Putin is protecting Assad ... and there a gas pipe that needs laying.....
3972 2018-03-13 17:00:37 Your the Don man. You probably spend every night with naked Lithuanian triplets, baby oil and a bunch of bananas
3973 2018-03-13 17:00:34 I'm glad Big Oil is out, but Big War and Big Torture are probably going to be worse. Sigh.

Here's Goldman with one more  Vía zerohedge
3976 2018-03-13 17:00:27 Rex is tight with Putin, so don't give the guy too much credit here. Tillerson came on board to protect a multi-million dollar oil deal he had with Putin/Exxon.....
3977 2018-03-13 17:00:25 Tillerson did his job knowing where all the gas, oil, arms, sex, drugs, human  trafficking, organ harvesting & adrenochrome gathering connections  are!

3980 2018-03-13 17:00:00 We've heard through the olive trees that we're the best olive oil used for cooking. Thanks for the shoutout @goodhousemag!
3981 2018-03-13 16:59:59 No that was a bit of a flash in the pan. A lot of the people who derided them for ‘buying the title’ seem to have no problem with Russian gangsters and oil princes doing it x1,000,000 via more fashionable clubs.

3985 2018-03-13 16:59:25 I was told vegetable oil.  I dont know of any other kind.
3986 2018-03-13 16:59:20 Tillerson was a fake SoS. He’s an oil peddler, a deal maker who used the office and his diplomatic immunity to travel freely and out of the public eye. No press, no scrutiny ..not even any staff in many cases.
3987 2018-03-13 16:59:17 @kikihealth  You have acted promptly to me about my query re.the CBD oil and I am terribly grateful. Elliott Gee has just sent me an email. Thank you so much. Julia

3990 2018-03-13 16:59:11 Ironically Tillerson probably was complicit in the least amount of deaths of all the people on that list. Not to defend a sociopathic oil baron but maybe we ought to rethink what it means to be a bad secretary of state

4000 2018-03-13 16:58:27 Vitamin E oil saves my life everyday
4001 2018-03-13 16:58:17 Yes, I can't fault Handmade Naturals, the cleansing oil is my all time favourite & have purchased many times 
4002 2018-03-13 16:58:11 And the Koch family got their money building oil refineries for Hitler and Stalin. Facts.
4003 2018-03-13 16:58:10 We are just a ripple in an ocean,
But to all creatures there's a shadow under which we sail.
Although we embrace their beauty
We ignore them when they wale.
We polute our oceans
With plastic & oil.
If this was your garden, your blood it would boil.
4004 2018-03-13 16:58:09 I think by the time of the tobacco lawsuits everyone knew too. We all knew about pollution, but not global warming.

The wealth creation argument is probably right, but assumes artificially cheap oil didn't inhibit alternatives, which it did to some extent.

4010 2018-03-13 16:57:07 Hey, Billy, at first never Trumpers screamed “Tillerson is an oil guy & is Putin’s friend! Don’t approve him!” Then Trump fires him & the derangement continues with “Trump fired Tillerson for blaming Russia for spy poisoning!” Must be quite a little scene in that head of yours.
4011 2018-03-13 16:57:04 Heard of cuticle oil?

4014 2018-03-13 16:56:50 After oil dries up, in few decades all arab countries will become BIMARU. Then they all can adapt hindi which is closer to their languages.
4015 2018-03-13 16:56:50 I wanna go home I wanna clean my room , have a nice hot bath , drench myself in baby oil , dance around my room in only underwear and sing to songs I don't know the lyrics of 
4016 2018-03-13 16:56:49 You're not telling it how it is. Salmond was right to say that oil was a bonus in the context in which he did and to include it as part of the economy, because it is. Some members of his own party have just suggested treating the revenue as a bonus in an economic plan.
4017 2018-03-13 16:56:39 Wow! Rose serum by Dior @davelackie ?! ⚘I love cosmetics with rose oil & have some soaps, lotions from Europe ...but your offer is extraordinary Dave!
4018 2018-03-13 16:56:37 Trump believes he is Putin's partner and they are going to control the world's oil..

4021 2018-03-13 16:56:12 This is exactly what I was thinking. Tillerson did what he needed to do and now he needs to go back and work the oil deal out with Putin. We are all being grifted. It’s a shell game. It’s all an act to keep us looking the other way while they steal our money & line their pockets

4025 2018-03-13 16:55:45 Started a *NEW* regime today. Apple cider vinegar after washing my face and Jamaican black Castro oil on my lashes. Trying to do this everyday. 
4026 2018-03-13 16:55:41 Future rUK Gov's, not UK Gov's. The then UK Government that was making the decision and using it as a threat to influence the outcome. 

Shipbuilding is important. The oil industry and UK Gov were predicting and boasting about an oil boom too, but that is not defined as a threat.
4027 2018-03-13 16:55:32 Getting oil changed tonight & my system put in and the tint goes on tomorrow, ahh new car is coming together 
4028 2018-03-13 16:55:26 Some 11 herbs and spices and some hot oil could fix the noise problem
4029 2018-03-13 16:55:25 おっぱいが大きい人がTLに居ておっぱいが大きい人だ！！！ってなりました
4030 2018-03-13 16:55:18 they be using some dirt ass oil too, they chicken and fries had my stomach wallin for like 2 days
4031 2018-03-13 16:55:18 I ordered CBD oil treats for my dog to help with joint/hip pain... I’ll let you know if it helps :)
4032 2018-03-13 16:55:16 Only if it’s made with butter. Good news tho, just buy corn and make it yourself using plant based oil :-)
4033 2018-03-13 16:55:15 U.S. just became the largest exporter of oil in the world. Mission accomplished, Rex Tillerson, former Exxon Mobil CEO.  The world has changed and Trump is changing with it.
4034 2018-03-13 16:55:03 IF Oil prices go lower, how would they get a valuation they like? That’s my point. The geniuses on TV all seem to think this is bearish for Oil. I see it as the opposite. We’ll see. Summer driving season & all.
4035 2018-03-13 16:54:46 In light of SB 726 (CBD oil and THC-A oil; certification for use, dispensing) passing both houses of the General Assembly, I’m attending the “Drug Impaired Driving and the Impact of Legalizing Marijuana” session @AAMVAConnection Workshop and Law Institute.
4036 2018-03-13 16:54:44 That’s the only way I do it, minus the healthy coconut oil bullshit 
4037 2018-03-13 16:54:41 It doesn't and no one has said it would! If you use solar to generate electricity  then you don't need as much oil hence you don't need a pipeline expansion!
4038 2018-03-13 16:54:40 Ngl I was being sarcastic cos I’m sure fries just consists of potatoes and oil?
4039 2018-03-13 16:54:36 Who recommended Rex to Trump? Remember he didn't know Tillerson.  Did Rex get that Russian oil deal completed?
4040 2018-03-13 16:54:34 'One thing, in considering my state of mind now, seems to me beyond dispute; that i have, at last, bored down into my oil well, and I can't scribble fast enough to bring it all to the surface.'
Virginia Woolf, Monday, April 20th, 1925.
4041 2018-03-13 16:54:33 After two long days of dropping my transmission I found out that my oil pan gasket was the problem for my oil leak. 
4042 2018-03-13 16:54:32 ...since when we have had the collapse in North Sea oil revenue and the Eurozone Crisis. Or do you think those should have been factored into the 2010 forecasts?
4043 2018-03-13 16:54:30 When you're so corrupt that a representative of Big Oil can't stomach going along with every aspect of your greed-fed treason.
4044 2018-03-13 16:54:24 I have this fear with oil paint. I just bought a palette by new wave palettes called a masterson palette. It seals the paint in overnight!

4048 2018-03-13 16:53:45 So you think Putin collided with Trump so that the US could surpass Russia in oil production and weaken their economy yet you think HRC selling them Uranium is NBD.  Who are you callin a dim wit? 
4049 2018-03-13 16:53:43 I thought he was just figuring out how to make more money from his investments in oil and gas...you know, like all the kleptocrats.
4050 2018-03-13 16:53:37 My poor car no gas no oil... get it together Stephh!!!
4051 2018-03-13 16:53:34 Lest we get too sentimental, Tillerson was a terrible choice from before day 1, an oil executive who was totally unsuited to the job, and his tenure was wildly underwhelming. The only question now is whether State can or will be salvaged.
4052 2018-03-13 16:53:33 CLOVE OIL!!! Walgreens should have it

4064 2018-03-13 16:52:22 Black Jamaican Castor Oil is sssoooo much better than the regular kind! 
4065 2018-03-13 16:52:15 Rinse in (very) hot water ... 
Pine Gel works wonders surprisingly, but don't expect the same quality after using it. 
Or persistent washing and soaking over time removes grease and oil.
4066 2018-03-13 16:52:07 Coal, oil, tax cuts, tariffs, bank regulations, foreign policy......
4067 2018-03-13 16:52:06 pls do and yeah i think it may just be the oil used after because i break out immediately like an allergic reaction

4069 2018-03-13 16:51:42 The environment is key to our future! We must get away from coal and oil and move towards clean energy! Companies like Tesla must be praised
4070 2018-03-13 16:51:36 Did you see @sardesairajdeep face? Like he's just been asked to take castor oil!!!!
4071 2018-03-13 16:51:29 and the Exxon - Rosneft 1/2 trillion dollar oil deal went down the shitter at the beginning of the month.  No more need for Tillerson, he's free, he's failed Putin.
4072 2018-03-13 16:51:26 I'm sorry Christopher but the Oilers drafted a player named Magnus Paarjarvi-Svenson. Either a different player...or the namebar was too heavy.  Perhaps the Oil have another under performing 1st overall pick with too heavy a namebar?
4073 2018-03-13 16:51:18 Tillerson out, just screams to me that Trump uses people until they are no longer a benefit to him. In the first year. Trump was working to open up oil and natural gas, Rex with his history at Exxon, was crucial for insider information.
4074 2018-03-13 16:51:17 #makeuptwitter what’s the best oil control moisturizer and primer?
4075 2018-03-13 16:51:14 Canada is the dirty belly button of the Oil industry, sticking your finger in the belly button isn't going to stop the flow of other exit points.
4076 2018-03-13 16:51:08 Oil is at 2.10 a gallon. You want a gas tax like California? You won't let them drill here.
4077 2018-03-13 16:51:07 I hope that oil CEO lands I his feet. I guess being the world’s top diplomat with no experience just wasn’t for him.

Add some water & boil the gravy for 10 minutes. Salt & a pinch of sugar. Add the fried fish & summer gently for 5 min.
4081 2018-03-13 16:50:42 Actually, we are making others rich by NOT exporting. US #1 oil producer with 1/3rd our reserves. BCLNG cancellation = multibillion dollar deal for US (with China). Block AB oil = increase OPEC/Russia/Venezuela/etc profits & maintain discount for US. Get it?
4082 2018-03-13 16:50:25 Well, Musk is a genius. A snake oil sales genius. 
4083 2018-03-13 16:50:24 Trump isn’t governing. He’s sending Tillerson off to buy up all the oil leases. This isn’t Democracy—it’s Kleptocracy! #Resist
4084 2018-03-13 16:50:24 I need more coconut oil

4088 2018-03-13 16:50:09 Never trust an oil company CEO that supports climate change initiatives.
4089 2018-03-13 16:50:08 It's amazing how the BIGGEST club in England @ManUtd and BIGGEST club in Europe @realmadrid bought absolutely whoever they wanted, for whatever amount they wanted till yesterday do dominate othees, and suddenly @PSG_English @ManCity became all about Oil and Gas money. Hypocrisy.
4090 2018-03-13 16:50:05 are you saying Pompeo is a more dovish Putin loving guy than Putin's old gas and oil buddy Rex?

4092 2018-03-13 16:49:41 Jordan is BIMARU of the Arab world. No Oil, No Money. Only living on doles from neighbors. Sounds familiar? #StopHindiImposition
4093 2018-03-13 16:49:41 There is a store in town that offers many varieties. My neighbor is quitting and she buys something similar to what Barbara mentioned (just can't recall the specific oil in hers).
4094 2018-03-13 16:49:28 You’re not willing to reason, if any of that were true Trump would not be upping oil output, would not have done a petrol deal with the UK, or helped France get one w Africa, he’d also support Iran deal.
They lied to u, there isn’t collusion, be angry at them, not defend the lie.
4095 2018-03-13 16:49:25 It’s funny. Why would Putin want trump to win? Trump winning hurts Russia. We are producing more oil, which hurts Russia. Why would putin want that? Lol. Think for once instead of believing the media 24/7. We are legit going to drill in all of Alaska. Yeah, Putin def wants that!
4096 2018-03-13 16:49:24 sam with his oil?
4097 2018-03-13 16:49:13 Major side effect of having an idiot like Trump in charge. Harmful enough his own ideas are so bad and stupid. But because he is such a shithead he can't attract remotely qualified people. Only snake oil salesmen, criminals, and other assorted self-interested sycophants
4098 2018-03-13 16:49:08 In a united country like Canada, where Albertas Oil plays a huge role in keeping Canada’s economy strong, it is strange that we can’t get our oil to the world market. When is @JustinTrudeau going to realize that special interest groups are having a negative impact on our economy
4099 2018-03-13 16:49:03 They're the hottest thing to ever consume oil and apex seals.
4100 2018-03-13 16:48:40 When president Washington taxed the Pennsylvania Whiskey farmers at 20% ,  when they refused to pay, He sent the militia to ride them down and slice them up!
Ppl join the military for status and pension, they have no problem invading other countries for oil interest,
4101 2018-03-13 16:48:21 Even better with a dab of olive oil some BBQ sauce and lots of parmesan
4102 2018-03-13 16:48:15 No, even better !  She colluded and STILL lost.  Only fools would believe Russia wanted Trump.  I bet u believe they wanted the US to surpass they in oil production and decimate Russian soldiers in Syria yet Hillary selling them Uranium was no big deal.  
4103 2018-03-13 16:48:12 You mean how Americans snoop on other countries, invade them for oil... fund rebels to overthrow leaders they don't like... AMERICA is the biggest fucking busybody in the world... and you get butthurt over a tweet?  haha!
4104 2018-03-13 16:48:01 here's a long crude oil thesis I hadn't heard yet: "Millennials are buying RV's"
4105 2018-03-13 16:48:00 BUDAK BIO MOLE DENGAN OIL AND GAS YANG PALING NDADA CLASS KENAPA DORANG JA YANG SELALU TIDUR AWAL ?! KENAPA BUDAK FORENSIC JA BALIK BALIK ADA CLASS LEPAS TU BALIK BALIK B’GADANG  KASI SIAP HOMEWORK 
4106 2018-03-13 16:47:55 It’s actually pretty simple when you think about it. Your hair is getting oily because your scalp is dry. It’s trying to fix itself by overproducing oil to replace the lack of oil on your scalp. The issue is trying to fix it. Because they only way to fix it is to let your hair –
4107 2018-03-13 16:47:50 I’d like to do a Nugent spoof song where I sing for 20 minutes in great detail about taking a Maserati in for an oil change...
4108 2018-03-13 16:47:41 If the Aramco IPO is on hold… is it because the Saudis think Oil price is going Lower or Higher? If they thought lower, why not shove it out the door now, while the price is $60? Media’s take seems wrong to me. We’ll see!
4109 2018-03-13 16:47:38 Mega Oil Man Rex Tillerson belittled himself and the State Dpt to impress this little President. I  have no sympathy for him.
4110 2018-03-13 16:47:23 Bahahahaha that’s the funniest thing I’ve seen in a long time! They need to oil them steps better next time!
4111 2018-03-13 16:47:21 Sure, lets fight them so we remain dependent on middle east oil and allow china to drill in our backyard with their inferior technology! You liberal fools!
4112 2018-03-13 16:47:15 finally got a oil change 
4113 2018-03-13 16:47:12 Cooked beans without oil, Maggie and salt step down with a glass of smoothie.#fitfamlevel
4114 2018-03-13 16:46:52 Grey. I’m buying new centercaps for my rims and getting an oil change
4115 2018-03-13 16:46:50 So far, since Trump took over the Whitehouse; he has put forth rules and regs that have been punishing on the very ppl that had voted for him. Medicaid recipients, farmers, industrialists, southern states that will see tourism drop because of oil wells cluttering the scenery.
4116 2018-03-13 16:46:39 Tried it with coconut oil. Threw up a proper one. Soooooooo gross. I'd rather do black sugarless coffee.
4117 2018-03-13 16:46:32 Oil money
4118 2018-03-13 16:46:32 Why don't you go to Kuwait City and  tell the people you meet running shops that they have no rights and deserve to live under tyranny because you think they are part of an "oil empire".
4119 2018-03-13 16:46:29 Only Donald Trump could make a senior oil executive a relatively sympathetic character in this ridiculous pantomime of an administration.
4120 2018-03-13 16:46:24 Hey Paul, do you think the American public are dumb? We all know that Tillerson stepped aside the minute ththat Exxon pulled out of the oil deal that isn’t happening in Russia. You need to start acting like an American again

4129 2018-03-13 16:45:42 I have spent most of today under the tractor, which is not the most pleasant place to work. But oil is flushed and changed, and transmission issues fixed.
4130 2018-03-13 16:45:33 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
4131 2018-03-13 16:45:29 The Kuwaitis I met running carpet stores and coffee shops made no money off of oil. They shook my hand. I never met an oil company executive over there.
4132 2018-03-13 16:45:17 Rather than cut the legs out from old people why not roll back all the snake oil supply side tax cuts that Congress has handed out over the years.
4133 2018-03-13 16:45:15 or that one would miss Rex (with hands dripping of oil) as someone somehow stabilizing the house of madness.
4134 2018-03-13 16:45:13 This 63-64 zone has become so hard for oil to break upwards seems like big boys profit taking here

4136 2018-03-13 16:44:58 Why is it that all the liberals and msm complained that Tillerson was killing the earth with xom and he was the devil who was going to lead us into an oil war and now you’re complaining he left?
4137 2018-03-13 16:44:58 Even the oil guy you were in bed with couldnt stand you for long.  Resign, ratfucker.
4138 2018-03-13 16:44:56 それ以前に「かわいさ」とはなにか？という定義の話から始めなければならないからこの話はやめよう
4139 2018-03-13 16:44:56 Tillerson could have cared less, as long as the oil deals got done. Pompeo is a true believer looking to push forward America First. Dangerous.
4140 2018-03-13 16:44:51 Comparing MLB and NFL contracts is like mixing oil and water. Polar opposite structures.
4141 2018-03-13 16:44:47 Can someone please explain to me why I’m inexplicably sad to see a oil CEO turned politician lose their job?! Anyone?! #madworld2018
4142 2018-03-13 16:44:45 I gotta check oil again, but I'd bet they want to shake the weak hands now that they're on the run, and I'd like to take profits on my short. lol
4143 2018-03-13 16:44:38 Putin has no fear of Britain. He split Britain from the EU, weakening Europe. He interferes in European elections whenever he wants. He has some filthy, disgusting hold on Trump. Oil prices are decent, if not optimal. And Putin is ... lethal.
4144 2018-03-13 16:44:33 Oh he was just in Chad, working on "travel ban" issues. Guess which oil company is having a blast in Chad.
4145 2018-03-13 16:44:30 With Tillerson being fired, does this mean he won't get his share of the Russian oil company??? #sarcasm
4146 2018-03-13 16:44:24 Try lemon oil (essential oil)
4147 2018-03-13 16:44:21 I thought this would make people happy. Aide goes back to BP, Tillerson to Exxon, no more oil people at the State Department. But people are mad. LOL.

4149 2018-03-13 16:44:03 This is such a trash presidency that it managed to make me feel a quarter-second's sympathy for an oil executive who was an absolutely terrible Secretary of State
4150 2018-03-13 16:44:03 Does this take place in your church?
James 5:14 "Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:"
4151 2018-03-13 16:43:59 Did you ok this with Vladimir first? What about the oil deal Rex promised him.

4157 2018-03-13 16:43:35 @Coldpressedoil  Hi  do you have a list of markets shows you are attending this year? My 10 bottles I got from you at Romsey Farmers Market are running out - can’t have a roast without my oil hahahahaha 
4158 2018-03-13 16:43:20 true, i mean if peppermint oil could rouse anastasia’s memory the way it did, why shouldn’t the smell of an NG do the same?
4159 2018-03-13 16:43:18 What's your opinion on neglected Ghani oil industry. Will it strengthen farm's resilience or is it overhyped.

4163 2018-03-13 16:43:08 No, I had like 13! Not the roads, just old cars whose oil I never changed 
4164 2018-03-13 16:42:46 My Virgo ass kept waking up last night to make sure i had everything packed and ready to go, but i left my vitamin E oil and my chapstickkkk 
4165 2018-03-13 16:42:39 I will call for the finest most dedicated indigenous workers to the front lines of the oil sands and pipeline projects. 

To protect the interests of our people, not to be swayed by foreign interests.
4166 2018-03-13 16:42:17 Not necessarily a spill -there are lots of natural oil seeps from the Monterey Formation around San Pedro.  But yeah, also many opportunities for spills associated with the port.
4167 2018-03-13 16:42:16 Remember when everyone was whining about Rex and Exxon oil ties and Russia Russia Russia? I do, now Rex is out and Rex all of a sudden wasn’t Exxon or Russia Russia Russia? LOL
4168 2018-03-13 16:42:14 Another recipe to share. Thanks. Soya sauce comes in handy for that Indo Chinese fusion. Coconut oil is the tastemaker MSG here. Must try coconut vinegar though.
4169 2018-03-13 16:42:11 I had mine tested
 Only nicotine & vegetable oil.
4170 2018-03-13 16:42:08 Happy Birthday Robert. Great effort this past weekend!!!
4171 2018-03-13 16:41:59 I cleaned it with something we sell I guess and its only for wood but OOp I used it on tile. its an oil soap so it helped out a lot but biiiiiiiiiiiitchhh it smells like oranges mixed with bleach
4172 2018-03-13 16:41:57 Do a mask with real honey and your fave type of oil, winter always dries my hair out but whenever I do that I find my curls look shinier and more moisturized
4173 2018-03-13 16:41:54 I know it doesn't occur to you, but investors and companies want to be able to get their product to market. Where exactly do you think oil companies are going to sell their product to? The US market, which the PCs thought would last forever, is now a discount market. Kenney is

4181 2018-03-13 16:40:58 It turns out olive oil is not a great substitute for vegetable oil when making waffles #snowdaycookingadventures
4182 2018-03-13 16:40:54 At the time or Congress BJP used to talk against the petrol prices and look at the price now! At congress’ time oil barrels were expensive and the price they sold oil was a lot better and now when the barrel is like ₹45 and the price is ₹80
4183 2018-03-13 16:40:47 Till was bad manager as SOS BUT He has 'skeletons in His closet'2 as CEO of BIG Power Exxon Oil but we could see Him change His course 5 months ago due 2 fights w/Trump. Even calling Prez an 'idiot'. If Rex was doing it 4 good of USA OR Fear of Mueller?No Matter it was Good 4 USA
4184 2018-03-13 16:40:46 Caster oil? Isn’t it for cars over 100,000 miles
4185 2018-03-13 16:40:43 I have no gas in my car and my oil light is on
4186 2018-03-13 16:40:43 Yeah, nobody is saying that.  Tillerson was shill for big oil, and a terrible choice for Secretary of State.  Just like Trump is a terrible choice for president.  Which is why he's #NotMyPresident .
4187 2018-03-13 16:40:41 There is something to be said for an oil executive pressed into government service because of his ties to Putin getting fired for admitting Putin is a terrible person. Here's to you, #RexTillerson.

4189 2018-03-13 16:40:35 A conversation between Tillerson and Trump in 2015. "Tilly, if I were President, believe me I would get rid of sanctions on Russia, end NATO, & give Syria to Valdy. That would get Exxon's billion $ oil deal done." Tillerson,"For your 10%?" DJT leaning forward, "As president 60%!"

4193 2018-03-13 16:40:13 Putin doesnt want globalism/Hence the attempt to put wedge between Russia,USA & peace. That is why fake Russia collusion story was created/Don’t forget Russia’s economy is based on oil/They don’t like us making more/Hillary is their girl/Time to sit & talk w Russia onsovereignty

4209 2018-03-13 16:39:02 The only thing Putin is in control of is, maybe gas prices rising 2morrow, otherwise he can kiss his oil tycoon buddy good-bye. Why on earth would people think it was Putin who fired Tillerson ? We are prepping for a Peace Envoy, and there's nothing wrong with that.
4210 2018-03-13 16:38:51 1st, I replied to May. 2nd, refined product requires pipelines and is more dangerous than bitumen. 3rd, it wasn't FNS - it was some financed partly by US interests. Last, do you oppose oil/LNG exports?
4211 2018-03-13 16:38:50 We should get rid of these out of Country "Trouble Makers" who don't have a clue of what's best for Canada, especially out West where "OIL Business" is sorely needed! The U.S. is now the biggest Oil Producer in the World, Canada should be 2ND!!!

4221 2018-03-13 16:38:13 Naypyidaw was built with Chinese bribes for Than Shwe in return for copper from #Letpadaung, jade from #Hpakant and for the gas/oil pipeline that runs right through Burma ending on the Rakhine coast at #Kyaukphyu , where the PLA is building a naval base. Capisce

4238 2018-03-13 16:37:02 After giving BP an oil contract on to a foreign company they had a huge oil spill in the Gulf, Obama not only bungled the clean-up process, he slowed oil production from other companies that had done nothing wrong which led to higher oil prices!

4240 2018-03-13 16:36:46 Russia exports oil and coal to N. Korea but its limited because of UN sanctions for N. Korea's nuclear program (and accused of exporting more through Chinese companies) N. Korea invites Trump to talk about a Nuclear disarmament. Wonder if US will back lifting UN sanctions 
4241 2018-03-13 16:36:37 I use rosehip seed oil!
4242 2018-03-13 16:36:34 I did!  Though calling something healthy when the oil on the nachos is glistening in the background is pushing it a bit 
4243 2018-03-13 16:36:22 If they stored the oil 100MM cars and trucks China has expanded its vehicle fleet by gives 250MPG or so. They added 35MMbl to the SPR. Don't read the news they are all idiots. As are the IEA and most analysts.
4244 2018-03-13 16:36:16 No, Gord , Trudeau wants it both ways..safest possible oil pipelines tied to environmental protection. He has said we can walk and chew gum at the same time. Pollyanna? In this political environment probably but closer to truth with respect to his philosophy.

4257 2018-03-13 16:35:16 Build it and leave Iran to implode. We don’t need the oil either.
4258 2018-03-13 16:35:10 3. Con. mid distillates will also be strong as shale is low in them. It will not be able to fulfill the increasing demand for Middle distillates due to IMO and other commerce, because as the marginal barrel it is expected to produce more than the current oil slate does. it cannot
4259 2018-03-13 16:35:05 It's difficult for me to negotiate these contradictory times when the head of ICE and a former oil exec turned Sec of State come off as good guys. I liked it better when I knew who the bad guys were and could protest them without a second thought. #TillersonOut
4260 2018-03-13 16:34:55 That's Japan you are thinking of.  Nestlé, PepsiCo, Starbucks & Tim Hortons are all guilty of Palm oil deforestation, destroying endangered species habitats & having slave workers yet those companies still make tons of money.

4264 2018-03-13 16:34:12 Pipeline constraints for Canada have been overblown. Constraints mostly effecting #NatGas. As far as #Oil, transport by truck is expanding, and I'm perfectly fine with burning tons of #diesel to get product where it has to go. Eco-Terrorist might want to pay attention.  #OOTT
4265 2018-03-13 16:34:10 Whaaa? Fantastic if you cut into half, sear them in oil, top the flat surface with salt pepper and a dash of balsamic and grated cheese. Quality finger food 
4266 2018-03-13 16:34:09 WTI crude threatens the trendline since September Oil technical analysis
WTI has taken a spill in the last hour. That's a bit counterintuitive because the belief is that Pompeo is going to make it much more difficult for Iran to sell oil.
4267 2018-03-13 16:34:07 The salad at school is just weeds with oil on it
4268 2018-03-13 16:34:04 Used masala but tweaked it a lot. Marinated the chicken in box spice. Then fried it in little oil. Added some ketchup (2 tbsp) and then added veggies & 2 tbsp yoghurt. Sauteed for a while then served! Et voila.

4271 2018-03-13 16:33:54 There was an oil leak and I didn’t know lol so it ran out of oil and I was driving with no oil pretty much so it just blew up lmao
4272 2018-03-13 16:33:52 Cannabis oil for cancer is complete nonsense. People believe quacks for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it's because the quack promises a miracle cure with no side effects. Doctors and scientists give more honest and realistic info but it's not always what people want to hear
4273 2018-03-13 16:33:48 I used to have a Q45 that was slammed. Went through two oil pans before I decided it was time to make a shield for it lol

4275 2018-03-13 16:33:19 Too bad Rex Tillerson's Big Texas Corp oil deal fell through in Russia! What a shame! Especially after Texaco drilled that offshore well in Russian Waters. "You win some you lose some." Right?
4276 2018-03-13 16:33:17 @weirdmedicine What's your thoughts on cbd oil
4277 2018-03-13 16:33:09 What do they think about Kinder Morgan's plan to increase oil tanker traffic by 7 times out of Westridge and through the Burrard Inlet? #vanpoli #bcpoli #StopKM
4278 2018-03-13 16:33:08 Let me know how that solar power replaces everything oil is used for. Of course bringing cost down for consumers is blasphemy, and suggesting making refineries closer instead of over the border is also just ludicrous. That’s one logical alternative to pipelines.
4279 2018-03-13 16:33:00 I will not entertain a man who can't change a tire, headlight, breaklight bulbs, radiator cap or oil. Oh and yes, I know how.
4280 2018-03-13 16:32:56 Don't use coconut oil for your face it's a trap.
4281 2018-03-13 16:32:45 I only trust tea tree oil to treat my acne.

4283 2018-03-13 16:32:33 From a city fan who had no legends before oil money

4285 2018-03-13 16:32:30 The giant oil painting of James Baker is holding a box of candy.
4286 2018-03-13 16:32:24 ... the oil is for all of us sounds like my primary school teacher telling me I can be anything I want to be in future treat such statement with the contempt it deserves. 
4287 2018-03-13 16:32:23 Next door's tiny garden is flooded as a result of an invisible oil leak. My eyes are strained looking for signs of oil floating on top, at the same time my garden is flooded and grossly polluted with sewage which you can smell,
4288 2018-03-13 16:32:21 Well certainly millions of litres of sewage and millions of litres of oil would have very different short and long term effects ...... ?

4293 2018-03-13 16:32:00 Eat vegetables. Like the leaf ones. Put olive oil, vinaigrette then salt and pepper to taste. Lettuce is 1 point, spinach is 5 and kale is 10 points.

4295 2018-03-13 16:31:50 they affect the international oil market
4296 2018-03-13 16:31:34 Yes, what Amy said. SCL can't provide incentives for fuel switching. There are roughly 15k oil heated homes in Seattle and we're working on creative solutions to replace them with electric heating. let me know if you want to connect w/ PM at @SeattleOSE who is leading that effort
4297 2018-03-13 16:31:21 I seen a African Doctor this time so Africa caught it on time I told her in Rockefeller and I'm on Twitter with African Army she she understood  me when I said in Rockefeller I told her I own Standard oil she finished seeing me and said goodbye she got the message Africa
4298 2018-03-13 16:31:18 Nooooo, mana ada. I'm trying to clean my tikar. Used to stick it on using cellophane tape. Last week I removed it then it becomes sticky. So I cleaned it up using eraser at first, then my mom suggested oil. Started with rose oil ended with cooking oil (Nini's) 
4299 2018-03-13 16:31:16 I already cast you. Quit drilling, you've already struck oil! :P Way to keep marketing yourself! Smart move!

The basis for the suit is they caused global warming the single most debated topic besides evolution or nature vs nurture. Stick to acting where it's okay to be a incompetent. Don't you own a tank? Guess it's electric?

4313 2018-03-13 16:29:41 We have an update Lou! The Olive oil is safe for consumption. This sort of change happens if the oil gets too cold. Depending on how cold the oil got means that it may not turn clear again. I hope this clears any concerns. Drago

4318 2018-03-13 16:29:29 Gloves!! Hahah! Keep them on hand.  Raw meat, hair dye, oil changes, cat box, first aid...so many uses!
4319 2018-03-13 16:29:23 a natural mask i’ve done in the past is blend mayo, avocado, olive oil, and one egg. sounds gross but it does the trick and saves your wallet lol
4320 2018-03-13 16:29:13 He has succeeded for PUTIN ONLY! Sanctions still NOT implemented and he got policy changes done in Africa that benefit BIG OIL, corrupt regimes and other RICH Oil Men around the world! We (US Citizen's) won't know what's going on now...Mission Accomplished!
4321 2018-03-13 16:29:09 They don't need storage. It's producers & traders who will need storage to maintain the price if China sits on their hands for a while & bottom feeds from the desperate. China has oil stored as a reserve to wait out producers and traders.
4322 2018-03-13 16:28:54 Rex is donating his "dinosaur village" set to the museum of gas and oil petroleum institutue in downtown Burbank(institute).   And yet all kidding aside it wasn't a productive time in Rex's life yet he preserved and quit.

4328 2018-03-13 16:28:20 Oil is useful, esp in generating wealth, but its past time the world moves pass its usage. There are too many negative side effects from spillage, pollution, toxicity etc ~ A stronger focus(esp in the Caribbean) should be placed on renewable & sustainable systems
4329 2018-03-13 16:28:19 I need well want a man! Just to do house duties  or take my car for an oil change
4330 2018-03-13 16:28:19 Happy to accept the position of US Secretary of State. I just hope I can fill the shoes of such luminaries as Oil Man, Frankenstein, The Second Worst Presidential Candidate Who Lost To The Worst Presidential Candidate, War Criminal, War Criminal, War Criminal, War Criminal, War C
4331 2018-03-13 16:28:17 Interesting, are the first 3 of those government granted trade monopolies?  Or am I misremembering things?  I assume the last is an oil company, maybe also a government granted monopoly.

4338 2018-03-13 16:27:40 .@lisamurkowski and .@SecretaryZinke like to talk about oil and gas development and "real consultation" with indigenous communities in Alaska, yet they completely ignore the Gwich'in people. We #StandWithTheGwichin to #ProtectTheArctic
4339 2018-03-13 16:27:18 Pure play Bakken producers are guiding for continued, steady oil production growth this year, as far as I can tell
4340 2018-03-13 16:27:16 Quel rapport avec l'intérêt du "Big Oil" de diaboliser le CO2?
4341 2018-03-13 16:27:14 The world is not so simple. There is an agenda to demonise Russia both in the U.K. and US. This is about spheres of influence being threatened: Syria, Iran, oil and gas interests and the expansion of NATO.
4342 2018-03-13 16:27:11 arnold has me convinced the oil companies have caused global warming because they didnt warn us about the consequences of using petroleum energy
4343 2018-03-13 16:27:10 Uh not really, unless your hair is exactly like mine
Mine goes ridiculously fluffy after I wash it, so i have to plan when I'm washing it around when I'm leaving the house.
I also have a coconut oil based thing that basically just greases up my hair when it's too fluffy
4344 2018-03-13 16:27:08 “Ethical Oil” is a phrase coined by Ezra Levant who embodies the antithesis of ethical in every way. #ableg
4345 2018-03-13 16:27:08 What about the problem of raw sewage in the water ways, like billions of litres. Seems odd that certain provinces get a free pass for this as well as building a concrete plant that creates as much emissions as a new oil sands mine. #elitist #lying #crook you are.
4346 2018-03-13 16:27:02 Actually, that investment did not leave Alberta. Much of the movement of oil companies was planned well in advance of that election. 
Why do you hate people who have government jobs? They pay taxes, and support their communities. You would prefer them to be unemployed?
4347 2018-03-13 16:26:59 Getting my oil changed and I definitely hit my mans with the “I’ll let my dad know” when he came with the list of stuff my car needs cause I hit 30k miles.
4348 2018-03-13 16:26:58 It’s only because you’re famous. If you were still changing oil in a dealership, your dentist would never be texting you
4349 2018-03-13 16:26:54 Dig deeper. Was "low fat" diet used in the study really low fat? Typical "low fat" study model has been 30% fat, that is not low fat, ~10% is low fat. Were the diet models used compared to a whole food, plant based model with no processed food or added oil? If not, it's invalid.
4350 2018-03-13 16:26:52 @LBC @IainDale Are the EU going to stop importing Russian oil & gas? Nope. Thus, nothing can or will be done.
4351 2018-03-13 16:26:49 Exxon stock. He had a huge severance, like $30mil or something. Only company he ever worked for. Oil fields on up.
4352 2018-03-13 16:26:48 But why did Rex come out so tough on Russia being responsible for the chem assassination attempt if he’s Vlad’s oil buddy???
4353 2018-03-13 16:26:47 Been to the National and Scottish National. Definitely more enjoyable with a decent stand/bar to break up what is a long old day with loads of neck oil.
4354 2018-03-13 16:26:46 Horrible oil spill on the coastline of Johor between Tg Leman & Tg Sutera, 25 to 30kms. @KesultananJohor PLEASE help to ensure action is taken to clean up the oil & huge tar balls & punish those who continue to discharge oil into the sea irresponsibly.
4355 2018-03-13 16:26:43 Was too happy when my coconut oil and biotin got delivered yesterday 
4356 2018-03-13 16:26:39 Kind of like Ben Carson, great neurosurgeon who knows very little about housing, and Rex Tillerson, who was an oil wiz but knew little about politics, and.. and...well, Donald tRump, who has no idea how any of this works.
4357 2018-03-13 16:26:39 When Trump appointed Tillerson, I recall that she said he was a friend of Putin and didn't approve of his appointment, and that he was an oil man who didn't care about the environment.  Now, she likes him & criticizes Trump for replacing him?  Geez.
4358 2018-03-13 16:26:37 Linda McCartney also uses palm oil, hardly vegan tbh
4359 2018-03-13 16:26:30 I was using Castile soap too until I realized it’s way to harsh on my skin. So red and irritated all the time. 

Ooh that oil blend sounds lovely! What do you use to tone?

4361 2018-03-13 16:26:10 My farts smell like an oil refinery today
4362 2018-03-13 16:26:08 America is headed to becoming the global leader in oil and gas. Rex Tillerson is the man to sell it. His firing is strategy just wait and see. Once an oil man, always an oil man. #MAGA
4363 2018-03-13 16:26:02 Wouldn't be shocked if Lucas Oil tried to get it. Haha.
4364 2018-03-13 16:25:55 @realDonaldTrump HEY MORON!! WE DON'T WANT YOU, YOUR CHAOS OR YOUR F-N WALL HERE IN CALI! QUIT EYEBALLING OUR SHORELINES TOO-WE'LL NEVER LET YOU START DRILLING FOR OIL, POISONING OUR BEACHES. 
You'll get what's coming to you as soon as the REAL investigation is done!! SAD
4365 2018-03-13 16:25:54 Getting my oil changed and I definitely hit my mans with the “I’ll let my dad” know when he came with the list of stuff my car needs cause I hit 30k miles.

4371 2018-03-13 16:25:38 If used like an oil sealant in conjunction with a water-based leave-in, I think so (someone correct me if I'm wrong)
4372 2018-03-13 16:25:34 Good riddance, Rex! However, let us not forget that Dems Manchin, Heitkamp, King, and Warner voted to put Mr. Big Oil in the cabinet. Our party cannot be full of sellouts.
4373 2018-03-13 16:25:33 Now we have you @RachelNotley pushing the same Conservative myths about oil and pipelines - Process the Tar Sands Oil in Alberta & create Alberta Jobs don't export those jobs and the pollution elsewhere - As a New Democrat I am ashamed of you as an NDP Premier
4374 2018-03-13 16:25:33 It will get to a point where you only have to sweat instead of buying oil to fry eggs...
4375 2018-03-13 16:25:29 I went to get an oil change and thanks to the caring professionals that looked my car over and found that I had a tire that probably wouldn’t have made it home. Not only did I leave with an oil change and my car vacuum out, but also 4 new tires at a great price! Thanks guys!!
4376 2018-03-13 16:24:53 no more damage than the potus who nominated himnow mr. putin about those oil plans
4377 2018-03-13 16:24:49 Not that I blame you, but US $ funding anti-pipeline activists so Cdn gas prices rise, then Cdns fill their tanks in the US.  US oil&gas industry is doing better & better and Cdns & Alberta suffering.  Doesn't make sense! #bcpoli #canpoli @FairQuestions
4378 2018-03-13 16:24:45 It could be,,,, or try avoiding caffeine after 2pm that will help with sleep too, sounds naff but try lavender oil on your pillow ,,, it helps me some nights when I can’t sleep xx
4379 2018-03-13 16:24:36 My view of Tillerson is that he's not too bad, just really narrowly focused on oil rights.  I mean I guess that's bad but I don't think he's an international criminal like Roger Stone.
4380 2018-03-13 16:24:29 I really just changed my own oil, put my own power steering fluid and anit freeze in at 8 months pregnant. S/O to my grandpa he taught me well

A คือไฟที่เกิดมาจากของแข็งทั่วไป 
B คือไฟที่เกิดมาจากของเหลวทั่วไป(เช่น น้ำมันเบนซิน)
C คือไฟที่เกิดมาจากไฟฟ้า
D คือไฟที่เกิดมาจาก”โลหะ”ติดไฟ
K คือไฟที่เกิดมาจากcooking oil

4387 2018-03-13 16:24:02 Thank you! I haven't tried it yet but I read it breaks some people out. Someone also said it made them oily though and I have dry skin so i was like tbh I could use a lil oil?? Did it help with hair/nails? I'm shedding a lot & wanna stop it :/
4388 2018-03-13 16:23:56 1. brazill and guyana will come online and will price expensively due IMO than before. refiners will still buy. But they ar emedium grades and wont need light shale oil to blend with.
4389 2018-03-13 16:23:50 Finland can do it with trees, fish and vodka but Scotland is fucked because we have oil?

4391 2018-03-13 16:23:45 Think about Palm Oil, lemon or Cactus type  highly secure corps  cultivation along US border, powered by solar powered water and  fertilizer distribution system. Use waste paper,cement and water for  drainage construction and if possible dig a long Canal.
4392 2018-03-13 16:23:41 Could it be that Rex ( sacked US secretary ) had an  appetite for Turkana oil?
4393 2018-03-13 16:23:36 Did he?  Or did Putin direct him to choose Pompeo over Tillerson?  Tillerson was supposed to get big oil money in Russian deal - he didn't.  Trump will try the other way.  Maybe Haspel can set up a site somewhere offshore to help get the Russian oil deal.  ???? Seychelles ????
4394 2018-03-13 16:23:35 Amsoil has been offering this type of oil for 2(?) decades now. In one of my cars in the past, I changed the oil only once a year and the filter twice.
4395 2018-03-13 16:23:27 I'm hoping he's ultimately a lot more Boy Scouts of America than Russian oil stooge.... could answer a lot of questions.
4396 2018-03-13 16:23:27 My mom had us drinking cod liver oil and caster oil every winter and I couldn’t stand it.
4397 2018-03-13 16:23:27  allow allow. The oil is for all of us. Haven't you heard that when a community brings up a child he doesn't drink pito? Only 1759 
4398 2018-03-13 16:23:23 Ill be your part time weird boyfriend ill suck your toes and rub oil into your feet all day xxx
4399 2018-03-13 16:23:08 I thought weaker dollar was better for oil price? No?
4400 2018-03-13 16:23:07 To each with their own conscience. Pls note they are not asking to come here. & btw venezuela is recognized as the country with the highest volume of proven oil reserves in the world today. What they need, is HELP getting their rotten dictator Maduro out!
4401 2018-03-13 16:23:01 Only thing on my face today is coconut oil and gloss. 
4402 2018-03-13 16:23:00 Coconut oil is not good for your face babe. 
For the rash, try applying calamine or baby bum, or lenovate
4403 2018-03-13 16:22:48 also SESAME OIL u need that shit for fuckin korean food
4404 2018-03-13 16:22:48 Although you're right about the routine undercutting of staff by "Prez," T1LLERS0N's credibility was tainted from the start.  He was another puppet of PUT1N's, who was clearly raptured by the prospect of sanctions-relief for lucrative oil deals.  That's actually how we got here.
4405 2018-03-13 16:22:44 Coconut oil really is life
4406 2018-03-13 16:22:36 I walked home from the shop cuz I didn't want to wait an hour for an oil change but I'm about to fall asleep now  taking too long
4407 2018-03-13 16:22:34 So if there is an oil spill, can millions of litres be spilled then? First, learn the difference between a spill and a dump.
4408 2018-03-13 16:22:32 Oh, and BTW, it's semantics, but I prefer "Oil Sands" instead of "Tar Sands". Tar sands is a deliberately negative term.
4409 2018-03-13 16:22:28 And MSM is completely MISSING the real reason why Tillerson is gone; it's the OIL Labowski!! Now Tillerson is gonna throw trump under the bus; mark my words, he's gonna be talking to Mueller!!
4410 2018-03-13 16:22:19 Norway biggest source of wealth is oil, and the over $300B pension fund from oil exports invest in major corporations, the kinds that you hated. Hey, don't get me wrong, I don't mind socialism as long as someone else is footing the bill, or the oil revenue keeps coming in.
4411 2018-03-13 16:22:19 Who would have possibly thought having an oil executive as the chief diplomat and executor of America’s foreign policy could end this badly under this POTUS?  Never saw this one coming.
4412 2018-03-13 16:22:01 They are olives on a branch.....I assume for olive oil
4413 2018-03-13 16:22:00 Lord.  Maybe Rex is gonna go back to the oil and fuel industry to help deregulation 
4414 2018-03-13 16:21:59 Stephanie Ruhle: “Pompeo was the single largest recipient of campaign funds from Koch Bros in 2010. He came out of the same Wichita,Kansas, biz community where Koch family’s oil-and-gas conglomerate is headquartered. Pompeo built his own company with seed money from Koch Venture
4415 2018-03-13 16:21:56 The time is soon coming when you won't be able to trade a supertanker full of oil or cold clean clear glass of water
4416 2018-03-13 16:21:42 The oil in Generac pressure washer should be changed after every 20 hours of usage. RT to spread this #MaintenanceTip
4417 2018-03-13 16:21:41 Why is everybody skirting the issue why Tillerson was named Secretary of State?

Republicants wanted to remove the Obama sanctions from RUSSIA and allow Exxon and Putin to drill for BILLIONS in oil in RUSSIA. #CORRUPTION
4418 2018-03-13 16:21:28 Of course he did. tillerson can't get to work on that 500 billion dollar oil deal with putin, if tillerson is still in office.
4419 2018-03-13 16:21:26 a true trans-patriot of oil.. yeah... 
One of the owner o exxon mobile..
4420 2018-03-13 16:21:26 Zinke: "I'm going to mark down Washington as opposed to oil and gas drilling." Says there are "no known resources of any weight" of coast of OR/CA/WA. @OPB
4421 2018-03-13 16:21:26 At some point in the future, some oil will be left in the ground simply because the cost of extraction & market price curve will crossover with cheap alternative energy & much smarter design of energy distribution. Much like steam VS coal. Horse VS Machine. #ableg #abpoli
4422 2018-03-13 16:21:16 I'd like to respond to that sarcastically: Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.

The fight against Canadian Oil is real strong there.
4425 2018-03-13 16:20:03 she complained when he was hired. exxon exec,oil man etc. now she complains when he is fired. she needs to make up her mind.
4426 2018-03-13 16:19:58 
4427 2018-03-13 16:19:56 I would just go full bugs bunny and use oil slick.
4428 2018-03-13 16:19:46 Tillerson supposed 2 deliver the $500 billions oil deal 2 Putin & lift all sanctions vs Russia not making you look bad by criticizing Putin.
4429 2018-03-13 16:19:38 Kenney: suddenly concerned about sewage but not oil spills into our rivers
Pipeline protestors: concerned about oil spills but not sewage into our rivers
Me: I just want clean rivers....

With a bit of 3 in one oil those doors will fling wide open a panorama of always open doors of the Commonwealth and around the world
4431 2018-03-13 16:19:31 The LRT will be in before the major developments at Port Credit GO and the Imperial Oil lands, and GO service frequencies will be improving.

Better transit service on the Lakeshore corridor will be needed soon, but we can't count on a Lakeshore LRT as because that depends on TO.
4432 2018-03-13 16:19:23 Canada pollution is not the problem, it's Canada getting unfathomably rich and stopping other countries monopoly on oil.
4433 2018-03-13 16:19:04 More proof of the abundance of oil in that WhiteHouse machine.
4434 2018-03-13 16:19:00 In the same vein, of moral questions; if we can put those dictators out of business and protect the environment by reducing our use of fossil fuels through moving rapidly away from oil to renewables shouldn’t we?
4435 2018-03-13 16:18:59 Or oil prices aren’t high enough for further growth
4436 2018-03-13 16:18:55 ความเรืองแสงได้ของบ้านนี้ ผิวดีมากก แล้วกุก็ขี้ชิปมาก ก บาปมาก
4437 2018-03-13 16:18:54 It was so horrendous to hire an oil industry executive who was close to Russia as Sec of State. Now its crazy to fire him and replace him with someone that has experience in gov't.  ITS AWFUL! Do you realize how stupid liberals sound when you screech about every decision?
4438 2018-03-13 16:18:54 Granted, the current ABC worked in the oil industry while completing a masters  & Pope Frank had multiple jobs including a bouncer while finishing his education in sem.
Never heard about the DL working his way through school.
4439 2018-03-13 16:18:51 Its a mutual agreement, Tillerson got the oil deals he wanted and @realDonaldTrump got his share. We're all fools ....... they played us all ......... and sold out the Country to do it.

4444 2018-03-13 16:17:57 Our plumber thinks he is so funny... he just answered the phone to me with “Hello trouble! What have you done now?” Didn’t know how to tell him that we had run the oil boiler dry 
4445 2018-03-13 16:17:56 Human Capital is the real oil.
4446 2018-03-13 16:17:49 When I was a kid in Vancouver there was an oil spill in the harbour, as the years went by the oil was still there just buried under layers
4447 2018-03-13 16:17:45 Hey DH, do explain why all of the major oil companies are in favor of carbon pricing. Remind me how many PC govts got a pipeline approved to tidewater (oh, that's right, they didn't think ahead that we should look for markets other than the US, who we sell oil at a discount to).

4453 2018-03-13 16:17:22 If by "early morning workout" you mean "drink a cup coffee and have it instantly pass through you, causing a scenario in your toilet reminiscent of the BP oil spill" then I work out 5 times a day
4454 2018-03-13 16:17:15 But I do the bentonite clay mask once a week too. I cleanse with Castile lavender soap morning and night (at night I tone before and after washing as well as using my spin brush) then moisturize with a mango butter/grapeseed oil blend & topped with 1/2 drops of rosehip oil

4461 2018-03-13 16:16:54 I don’t think Tillerson had Russian sympathies from birth. He formed a view of Putin’s government from his good experiences dealing with Russia in the role of oil executive. In his role as representative of USG he would have had new, less pleasant experiences.
4462 2018-03-13 16:16:51 Is it just me or did the democrats say that Tillerson was a oil company CEO polluter and a puppet of Putin? 

What the hell happened?
4463 2018-03-13 16:16:50 Olive oil really

4466 2018-03-13 16:16:19 If I were in dotard's shoes, I'd be shaking over Tillerson's wife.
You don't do that to a proud Texan wife's oil man, who worked his way to top of f*cking ExXon. 
She ain't never gonna forgive that mobbed-up, NYC conman coward... 1/2
4467 2018-03-13 16:16:16 People at the dealership tryna wash my car...yeet just an oil change
4468 2018-03-13 16:16:14 Anddddddddddddd my rosehip seed oil dah habis. 
4469 2018-03-13 16:16:08 When Tillerson was appointed, media said he had too close oil ties to Putin. Just no pleasing the Democrat media.
4470 2018-03-13 16:16:06 I don’t think so really. The face oil is a dry oil. It’s not going to make me extra oily which is great! I’m thinking of pairing it with either the snail moisturizer or the wild rose oil moisturizer but that’s extra stuff I’d have to buy. I swear by that rose moisturizer tho.
4471 2018-03-13 16:15:49 #Tillerson Returns to #EXXON!

That his heart bleeds for the oil and gas industry makes him one of the least credibly guests you have on your show. Come on Thom.

“Choosing an oil executive friendly with Vladimir Putin as Secretary of State sends a disturbing signal about President-elect Trump’s priorities.  Rex Tillerson’s cozy relationship with the Kremlin is especially alarming in light of his attitude...
4480 2018-03-13 16:14:50 Snow day update - I made pancakes out of banana fried in coconut oil topped with peanut butter and a side of turkey bacon. So the only thing of value I've done is eaten fat from 3 different sources.

4483 2018-03-13 16:14:31 But this will happen after the sanctions have been agreed. Until then Iran will be selling oil from storage whatever it takes.

4486 2018-03-13 16:14:23 It wont be legalised with #VictoriaAtkins as UK drugs minister she claims no medicinal value and a danger to society yet her husband @kenward_paul is legally allowed to grow 45 acres and sell cannabis oil worldwide earning millions as UK were biggest cannabis distributors 2017
4487 2018-03-13 16:14:15 Coconut oil is your friend
4488 2018-03-13 16:14:10 Is this cannabis oil with THC or without?
4489 2018-03-13 16:14:09 Clearly I need to make some additions to my routine   I wanna invest in the rose oil as well as the snail snot. But my skin is super sensitive so I’m a little skeptic.
4490 2018-03-13 16:13:56 I’m assuming we are willing to sign over rights to oil field for Rodgers’ value.

4497 2018-03-13 16:13:18 Flying didn't sink them. It was the recession, the dropping cost of oil & the cost of operations. Flights were taken care of.

4504 2018-03-13 16:12:21 That’s CBD oil which isn’t strong enough to kill cancer cells. You need cannabis oil with THC In which is still illegal here.
4505 2018-03-13 16:12:15 @Thom_Hartmann Julio's nuts the oil split hurt a lot of businesses. But the wildlife is more important than company. If a company can't run without hurting my environment then forget em. They did find oil for a long time in Florida shrimp.

4511 2018-03-13 16:11:46 @SecretaryZinke tells @SenatorCantwell there are no known oil and gas resources off coasts of Washington, Oregon and N. Calif., and he realizes her state opposes offshore drilling. Similar point made to @SenAngusKing about Maine's offshore. Implication: don't worry.

4528 2018-03-13 16:10:49 That’s not the proper stuff like she was taking. For cancer you need cannabis oil with THC which is still illegal here but it is possible to get hold of. CBD is good stuff Holland and Barrett’s very weak though.
4529 2018-03-13 16:10:32 He was the President Of Exxon and denied responsibility for one of the worst Oil spills in America as well as denied that oil pollution in any way is connected to climate change. He is anything but a nice man.
4530 2018-03-13 16:10:31 I think biore cleansing oil is not suitable for me. Today I notice pimples on my cheeks cause I stare my face very closely after I took a shower, I rarely get pimples there.

4534 2018-03-13 16:10:17 Difficult, as Germany is reliant on oil. Classic case of not rocking the boat.

4539 2018-03-13 16:09:46 Tillerson goes back to oil business and rescues Kushner with partnership from Russian oil oligarch. ?? #TrickyTuesday
4540 2018-03-13 16:09:41 @SecretaryZinke tells @SenatorCantwell first draft of offshore drilling plan will probably be out by late fall. "I think I'm going to mark down Washington as opposed to oil and gas drilling," he said.
4541 2018-03-13 16:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.
4542 2018-03-13 16:09:39 Have you tried these pure soaps named “savon de marseille”; it’s 99% olive oil and it dries your skin so much it’s literally the only thing working for my acne
4543 2018-03-13 16:09:29 If you work in the #oil and gas industry, stainless steel nameplates are the perfect choice to withstand the harsh environment.
4544 2018-03-13 16:09:20 Where are we going to find another Secretary of State with such a profound understanding of foreign oil is the real question we need to be asking ourselves right now.
4545 2018-03-13 16:09:15 Are guys who take countless shirtless selfies really guys tho? I’m from the country so I’m used to the country guys who barely know how to work their phone cause they’re always elbow deep in grease, oil or mud 
4546 2018-03-13 16:09:12 I mean he had traveled to one, and it was to make a super shady oil deal.  DeVos is a quack, but at least she has an ethos, I mean it's a crazy one but she believes in it

4553 2018-03-13 16:08:31 Putting lavender essential oil in my conditioner has been life changing!!! My hair is soooo soft! So if you don't already do it, plz try it #lavender #essentialoil
4554 2018-03-13 16:08:16 I've just met a woman who cured her cancer by completely changing her eating habits, exercise routine, and having a positive attitude to living. Rhona Byrne- she also got a rescue dog! It can be done. Cannabis oil cures many diseases. Rhona's doctor was shocked!
4555 2018-03-13 16:08:11 But ... the CEO of an oil company had no business being the #SecretaryOfState anyways ...
4556 2018-03-13 16:08:11 Hypocrisy of the liberal media today, when Tillerson was hired: he’s for big oil, ruins the environment, a novice in politics,for the 1% only... Media today: Rex was a moral compass,a reasonable man,a key negotiator.....no wonder people distrust the media
4557 2018-03-13 16:08:06 Lay your head down on me baby, coconut oil on my grey tee
4558 2018-03-13 16:07:59 The challenge now is to get jobs and residential development along the LRT corridor and the area near/around the two GO stations and the four MiWay & GO bus terminals...and places like the Imperial Oil lands & OPG lands...which aren't well-connected to rapid transit.
4559 2018-03-13 16:07:59 You can buy cannabis oil at Holland and Barrett so I think it already is.
4560 2018-03-13 16:07:50 Jeff O'Neill has had a hate-on for the Oilers ever since the Oil took Bonsignore ahead of him.

4562 2018-03-13 16:07:34 Also check ur education well. Why must it be when he is on an official visit to a shitehole country like nig.don't u think its a trap Trump been a bizman set for a former executive director of ex Mobil. Free crude oil deals so that he will not talk what he is seeing on ground.
4563 2018-03-13 16:07:29 Heid 1972 - still alive
For turning off lights and telling her family to use less water.
Amazing woman too..
4564 2018-03-13 16:07:28 I thought he just wanted to spend more time with his family. Ya know, he had the big oil deal with Putin, lots of rubles to spend. Summer in the Crimea. Boating on the Black Sea. Later found in his hotel room, heart attack they said.

4568 2018-03-13 16:07:19 @coe @USEmbSL @UNHumanRights @CanadianPM @realDonaldTrump @PMOIndia Is it because we don’t have oil or gas $ € £ to offer that you won’t help us get rid of someone like  DICTATOR Yameen. Only release press statements saying they condone things and are concerned. Nothing else
4569 2018-03-13 16:07:18 Lmao an oil change on any Bugatti is 20 grand. 
4570 2018-03-13 16:07:07 They now have a new tactic claiming that Democrats hate God, country, and Trump. No, Democrats hate traitors, Injustice, molesters, pedophiles, dictators, Russia taking over America, sex trafficking, human trafficking, and oil spills killing all marine life, racism and murderers.
4571 2018-03-13 16:07:00 How much is black seed oil & jojoba oil
4572 2018-03-13 16:06:49 Me: “...I feel like such an adult today!”

Dana: “You’re almost 30 years old and you got groceries and your oil changed. You need to calm down.”
4573 2018-03-13 16:06:44 .@SenatorCantwell asks Zinke to expand comment period for oil and gas 60 days. Zinke responds: “The comment period has closed. I know where people stand.”
4574 2018-03-13 16:06:38 Really yummy. Rip up some old bread, drizzle with olive oil, seasoning, herbs and grated cheese. Bake in the oven. Taste great. My kids love them and dunk into soup.
4575 2018-03-13 16:06:35 The truth is nobody has provided credible evidence regarding who did #Salisbury attack. Regardless, my fellow Britons mindlessly accept the establishment's #ConspiracyTheory that Putin did it 100%. Reminicent of the #WMD lies the establishment spun to get Iraq's oil @WLancsGP
4576 2018-03-13 16:06:30 Yep then the American .gov protected oil interests and we are still reaping the whirlwind of corporate greed coupled with .gov power.
4577 2018-03-13 16:06:18 Main question is why and when are you using tanning oil
4578 2018-03-13 16:06:16 U.S. is the new Oil-Business-Nazi

4580 2018-03-13 16:06:14 @MsGetty Nighttime: Deeper cleanse + face oil + snail ampoule
I use Boscia’s purifying cleansing gel with my Clarisonic and then follow up with the face oil (7 to 10 drops) and snail ampoule (1 to 2 droppers full).
4581 2018-03-13 16:06:12 got so much oil on my face america tried to invade it

4583 2018-03-13 16:06:11 Took a hoodie to the laundry place to get an oil stain removed. Adulting. Amiryt?
4584 2018-03-13 16:06:10 I’m just trying to figure out why I can get a 15 minute oil change in Greensboro but it takes an hour and a half here  and at least when I was taking my car to Chevy they were doing more than just an oil change 
4585 2018-03-13 16:06:08 There's something incredibly satisfying about ordering slide and valve oil. It's a visible reminder that I'm playing music regularly.
4586 2018-03-13 16:06:07 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.
4587 2018-03-13 16:06:04 You can tell my body type different , i can feel the oil from the fried foods just thinking bout it... like i want some checkers and i can just feel all that fried oil
4588 2018-03-13 16:06:04 Whereas Norway is getting close to £20 billion a year for less oil. If Scotland got that its budget annually could be 60% higher rising from £30b to £50b! Even getting just £4 billion tells me a lot is in other bank accounts or accountancy columns.
4589 2018-03-13 16:05:59 Of course he's out.  He couldn't make the Russia Oil deal happen.  What good is he? пока-пока (bye bye) comrade. ne pozvolyayte dveri udarit' vas po puti

4591 2018-03-13 16:05:54 It's all about oil. Russian oil.
4592 2018-03-13 16:05:52 Yeah bc face products trash  but I really I use natural soaps on my face, use oxy pads b4 bed, and I use grape seed oil as a moisturizer, I like avacodo oil better tho.
4593 2018-03-13 16:05:38 Norway does export oil, the government of Norway. Yes, most Norwegian oil isn't sold by "entrepreneurs", it's sold by the government.
4594 2018-03-13 16:05:29 Oil company minority interests, outside of the reach of the Enterprise Crimes people, perchance?
4595 2018-03-13 16:05:28 Rex might as well spill the beans.  He has his 200 million $ retirement package.  Give up Russia oil and save America.
4596 2018-03-13 16:04:53 They need to make up their minds. First it was her was hired because Putin wanted it for oil $ reasons, now it's he was fired because Putin said so. Which is it. Gzzzz
4597 2018-03-13 16:04:50 Hey #autonation made a 10:30 apt for a oil change on my #ford F-150 @margateford  this is gonna take over 3 hours for a oil change ?? So much for prepaid service never again !
4598 2018-03-13 16:04:49 I have no idea. I have no particularly loyalty to anyone in the Administration, but conversely, I'm not going to demonize every pick he makes. I was concerned about Tillerson's ties to oil, but that proved to be a non-issue.
4599 2018-03-13 16:04:38 We had an oil baron directing our foreign relations for a year and now we’ll just let the CIA do it while a torture site operator gets the top intel job. You almost have to admire this country’s dedication to evil shit.

4609 2018-03-13 16:03:58 Was she drunk at the 9/11 memorial? During that seizure on the plane in front of reporters? Or when Bill referred to her “frequently” having such episodes? She may be an angry alcoholic, but there’s something neurological happening here as well.
4610 2018-03-13 16:03:58 Though I will admit being initially opposed to an oil industry exec been appointed to Sec. of State, Tillerson proved to be one of the few people in trump’s administration with commonsense. I guess that’s why he had to be fired! No room for intelligence there.

4614 2018-03-13 16:03:48 Tillerson has been good on oil related policy. The shift to Asian affairs may call for different expert background.
4615 2018-03-13 16:03:39 Need to change my oil then i can take the trip in my truck
4616 2018-03-13 16:03:30 Practically though, Iran is a mono-commodity value.  Other than oil for which there are many alternate sources, they’re a fly-over country. The domestic economy is a shambles. Russia has other priorities. China needs Africa more.

4618 2018-03-13 16:03:26 "Mexican Balm" was a common name for hair-growth balms. Many manufacturers produced their own version. It might have been made from tonka bean oil.
4619 2018-03-13 16:03:20 And get back to the oil business
4620 2018-03-13 16:03:15 9pm tonight is my long awaited FBL draft.  I probably should look at stuff so I don't draft Oil Can Boyd or anything...
4621 2018-03-13 16:03:10 Babe I'm sure there's a herb or oil that can cure what you have.
4622 2018-03-13 16:03:07 Tillerson is out because Exxon-Mobil finally called off their attempt at a joint venture with Russian oil company Rosneft to drill in arctic water because sanctions could not be lifted. He was chosen for the role to expand US oil interests abroad, other reasons are distractions.
4623 2018-03-13 16:03:03 They are.  But who cares if our grandchildren die fighting for food and water, as long as your oil customers can make a buck along the way.
4624 2018-03-13 16:03:02 I’m currently using this oil, what were your thoughts? X
4625 2018-03-13 16:02:52 It's not as if the public hasn't been misinformed by coal, oil, and gas companies. We've been saying it was a bridge to more climate change since jump. It's just that the signal has been continuously interrupted. Blaming this on the climate movement = blaming the victim.

4630 2018-03-13 16:02:31 Daytime: Gentle cleanser + face oil + snail ampoule 
I use Fresh’s soy face cleanser followed by the Korres wild rose oil (about 6 drops) which has vitamin C for repairing and evening skin tone. Then I apply a thin layer (one dropper full) of the snail ampoule and let it dry.
4631 2018-03-13 16:02:29 Those microfibers didnt shed on me with oil yet. So im confident right now about them.
4632 2018-03-13 16:02:28 It’s amazing when you’re an oil club and you can buy whoever you want
4633 2018-03-13 16:02:23 China stashed 800m bbl in 3 years & at 1.5m bpd rate in Q1/Q2 2017. If I were China I'd divert bid to Shanghai to take control. Outside chance of US/China collaboration/stitch up. ie US Swing Producer caps oil at $65/bbl & China Buyer-of-Last-Resort collars oil at $50 #OOTT

4635 2018-03-13 16:02:15 I love rose oil for my skin. I don’t have rosacea but it’s done wonders for my other skin issues.
4636 2018-03-13 16:02:13 As a Liberal from California, I’ll be the first to say the country is now less safe without the Oil Man from Texas in charge. Fuck, #Pompeo
4637 2018-03-13 16:02:12 I hate getting my oil changed..it takes so fucking long.
4638 2018-03-13 16:02:11 Probably loyalty based on Kompromat - and $ in Russian oil company. Or fear of polonium-laced sweet tea.
4639 2018-03-13 16:02:05 All the countries you listed practiced capitalism. I don't know much about Finland but it is tiny with only 6 million people, Norway is a major oil exporter, a white Saudi Arabia, and Sweden, home of IKEA, that one is rapidly turning into a sh**hole.
4640 2018-03-13 16:02:03 Alright. I need to clean my car out, put some oil and wiper fluid in it, get some gas, air up my tires, make sure all my shit is packed, hit the nail shop, then slide up 45. I need to be in Houston by 5 & sleep by 10pm

4650 2018-03-13 16:01:09 You have every right to feel the way you do. There is no sense or justice when it comes to cancer. But people just do what we always do: try everything and hope for the best. My aunt decided to give up the fight because she couldn't stand the chemo anymore. oil might've helped.
4651 2018-03-13 16:01:07 I thought the same thing…plus, include her seizure, maybe some coughing fits, the Coke-bottle concussion glasses, her balloon wonderment, and her describing how she ended-up with an ankle brace.

I don’t feel bad, since I was called every name for questioning her health.

4654 2018-03-13 16:00:53 Rex Tillerson failed his personal objective: To close the Exxon /Rosneft oil deal. He got as close as Trump did trying to get his goddamned name on a building in Moscow. Putin played both of them.

4658 2018-03-13 16:00:41 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.

4660 2018-03-13 16:00:37 TIL Macassar is the hair oil used by men. Sounds almost like anagram of mascara. That's how I am going to remember when my turn comes up for smugbragging (sounds more appropriate than humble brag right?)
4661 2018-03-13 16:00:37 Tillerson failed his personal objective: To close the Exxon /Rosneft oil deal. He got as close as Trump did trying to get his goddamned name on a building in Moscow. Putin played both of them.
4662 2018-03-13 16:00:29 They lost Oil first. That seems to be the trigger. Put it on your radar.

4664 2018-03-13 16:00:29 @SecretaryZinke stressing to senators that draft proposed 5-year plan for oil and gas offshore leasing is only a first step to get the debate going: "I put everything on for discussion."
4665 2018-03-13 16:00:28 I been reading so much about natural ways to induce labor and NONE are working. All thats left to try is sex and castor oil and im not.

4667 2018-03-13 16:00:24 Tillerson is a war-mongering stooge of the oil industry... what? Never mind, we love Rex now!!
4668 2018-03-13 16:00:21 Didn't know you are one of Oil and gas biggest Lobbyists and your worth 100 million from selling to one of the biggest over seas oil and gas television news! Also Flying around in your jet!

4670 2018-03-13 16:00:19 Just got mine changed the other day... it felt so good having a new filter for my oil to enter
4671 2018-03-13 16:00:17 Wow I thought Rex had strong ties to Russia? I thought he was making President Trump millions with his oil connections in Russia? Or did he tip our hand on the poisoning? I guess he forgot we don't tell our enemies what we are doing or thinking.
4672 2018-03-13 16:00:17 All I see is white outside. Just curtains of snow! Set up my little workspace, have a soft blanket and my oil diffuser going and settling in for a working snow day. I kind of love these days.

4679 2018-03-13 15:59:35 And what a bloody burden it is. Managing director of a major oil company in Aberdeen (he is a dane) told all his staff to vote Yes, would be daft not to, and that the the north sea was here for the next 50 years minimum.
4680 2018-03-13 15:59:33 Your head of the EPA is a climate denier and oil industry sympathizer. Your education secretary couldn't pass a GED test. Your Secretary of State ( who you just fired) had business ties with the same foreign power that helped you get elected. Pick better people.

4682 2018-03-13 15:59:18 @Schofe FACT, big pharma makes money from sick people. It is not in their interest or profit to make people healthy. Cannabis oil is not legal because it actually cures compared to big pharmaceutical medicine which "helps" "but does not cure" a healthy world would kill big pharma

4685 2018-03-13 15:59:01 just dont be stupid like me and let any large amount of food go into the oven with moisture AND oil. bad combination. thank you :c i dont care enough to wear makeup now but for a nice event in the gay district of socal rofl
4686 2018-03-13 15:58:59 @FairQuestions may veer too far into conspiracy theory but w/o her research we would all have poorer understanding of the source of strength of campaign against Cdn oil. Too many Cdn journos still write as if p/l opposition springs from wholly local, grassroots sources.
4687 2018-03-13 15:58:59 I suppose it may be open to negotiation. But last time US sanctions were in force, Iranian oil exports halved to about 1 million b/d. Accounting for some growth in Iranian production and maybe less cooperation from some buyers, I've seen estimates of impact from 200-800k b/d
4688 2018-03-13 15:58:56 They r now mining Oil.. Rock night is quiet expensive
4689 2018-03-13 15:58:52 No person wants MS!! I had 4 MRI's last year (Yuck). September I had a spinal tap which confirmed I have relapsing MS, quickly was given powerful meds..NO THANK YOU. My system is too sensitive. Taking supplements, acupuncture & fish oil.

4691 2018-03-13 15:58:32 I’m old enough to remember when dems hated Tillerson bc he’s a successful businessman in the oil & gas industry. Like 12 hours ago. 

Life comes at ya fast. 
4692 2018-03-13 15:58:32 Vitamin E oil on your lips at night is THE BEST! I hardly need chapstick anymore. 
4693 2018-03-13 15:58:30 I accidentally found out that rose oil works amazingly to calm down rosacea flare ups. I also don't drink and don't eat too much dairy. But it's kind of amazing how well it works.
4694 2018-03-13 15:58:06 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
4695 2018-03-13 15:58:06 TUESDAY MORNING IN ENERGY: And it’s funny how quickly things blow up around here, isn’t it. We’ve got Rexit, the EPA giving a pass to Philadelphia Energy Solutions, and some oil volatility. And it's almost noon! #underthewire #OOTT #Iran

4698 2018-03-13 15:57:47 I love that trump bitches about the things like he swamp and the deep state but replaces his Oil tycoon SoS with a CIA director.  #cognitivedissonance
4699 2018-03-13 15:57:38 So, can we be like Norway with very generous social welfare programs paid for oil sales from our vast offshore fields? Has she ever been to Norway?

4705 2018-03-13 15:57:08 These liberals would rather get their oil from their friends in Iran.

4707 2018-03-13 15:56:59 Not by big companies , oil companies allowed for currency trading
4708 2018-03-13 15:56:59 Isn't the key clause the request for other importers to 'significantly reduce' Iranian oil imports? Any idea what 'significantly reduce means in 2018 and also in mmbd?
4709 2018-03-13 15:56:49 My skin is so happy right now! I also added a tiny bit of lemon oil! Huge fan of brandless so far  I’m not sure if you ever collaborate with bloggers but if you do Id love to work with you
4710 2018-03-13 15:56:44 @SunriseFordNoHo Your company needs to please make sure that when a customer's car is ready to be picked up from the service dept. that a phone call is made. I dropped off my C-Max on Saturday for an oil change/tune-up. 1/
4711 2018-03-13 15:56:43 @Schwarzenegger you’re a hypocrite. You’re suing big oil after you use more oil than anyone.
4712 2018-03-13 15:56:41 Wow, Tillerson got Comeyed. Pompeo is moving to State. He’s had support from Koch Bros over the years, including having been in business with them. Twice: aerospace & oil. He entered politics as a Tea Party member and won with help from Koch-funded superpacs. Another Koch stooge?
4713 2018-03-13 15:56:27 And also has VERY close ties with, wait for it...

The Koch Brothers.

That Russian oil is making them all crazy.
4714 2018-03-13 15:56:24 Snake Oil is actually rich in Omega 3 and would probably be better for you than most of the rubbish he's peddling.
4715 2018-03-13 15:56:24 Dan wake with palm oil?
4716 2018-03-13 15:56:16 Black people was already born behind. We gotta work twice as hard just to catch up to these white folks. We wasn't born with an oil or boat company. My grandma couldn't leave me nothing but some advice. She didn't have no property to leave me. So I'm starting from the bottom.
4717 2018-03-13 15:56:11 You know you can!! You can put veg oil with gas, it’s totally fine!!!
4718 2018-03-13 15:56:02 So looks like I've got a top end engine rebuild to do in a few weeks when I've got the money since I seem to have fuel in my oil

4730 2018-03-13 15:54:37 Talking about science and using nonsense terminology like 'energy process'. I wish Victoria had had more time to really break his barmy pseudoscience.

4735 2018-03-13 15:54:05 Ojala se la tomaran pero para reconstruir lo q dinamitaron, sembrar lo que llenaron con coca, para limpiar los rios que contaminaron con atentados al oil, para retirar las minas antipersona, para ayudar a los campesinos a regresar a sus parcelas, para levantar las torres de Ex
4736 2018-03-13 15:53:48 That's very easy to say when you play for a club that is backed by an oil rich nation (and a terrorist sympathetic one)
4737 2018-03-13 15:53:44 I dashed all the food into the sink and poured cooking oil into the glass and I took the empty blow and I set down
4738 2018-03-13 15:53:43 And the environmental protection agency. So soon they will drill for frack and drill for oil in the water supply of the poor and we will all have water like the poor souls of Flint Michigan

4742 2018-03-13 15:53:18 During the Tillerson conformation hearing Democrats said he was on the take for Russian oil and no experience! No democrats voted for him! Now he's a good guy! Your as fake as the Russia story.
4743 2018-03-13 15:53:16 There are many glaring examples, but the worst is Tillerson. He was chosen by Putin so he could get the sanctions lifted to make a shit-pile of money for their oil companies.

4747 2018-03-13 15:53:04 Rex will gladly return to his Arctic oil deal w Putin now...from which Trump clan & complicit GOPers will surely benefit 

These buggers see global warming as a pro-business move, making Arctic oil drilling a little easier for those involved & freeing up Arctic shipping lanes
4748 2018-03-13 15:53:03 "Hey Timmy, what's a really good way to describe just how abnormal this presidency is?"

"When you're slightly concerned that a former oil executive is losing his job as secretary of state?"

"Indeed, Timmy. Indeed."
4749 2018-03-13 15:52:48 Rex was a big oil executive and lobbyist. When trump appointed him the left threw a fit. Awarded by Russia in 2015Now they like him lmfao

4754 2018-03-13 15:52:26 Every single person trump ousts says how great he is. I expect more of the same from Tillerson. He’s still hoping for a cut of that Russian oil money he worked so hard to get, even if he couldn’t deliver.

4757 2018-03-13 15:51:51 Russian man no longer likes tillerson. He did not get sanctions lifted so he could drill oil.
4758 2018-03-13 15:51:38 โปรดบอกฉันทีว่าเธอสบายดี

4759 2018-03-13 15:51:35 Tillerson wanted the Russian oil deal for Exxon. It's not like he has to worry about where his next meal will come from. He's set for life not working another day if he chooses. Little sympathy from me. #TillersonOut
4760 2018-03-13 15:51:15 1) I was against both of them and revealed info in regards to HRC accepting a donation of a house in Florida by a man convicted of both oil and banking crimes while Bill was in the WH

4772 2018-03-13 15:50:00 What happened to the Tillerson/ Putin bond? I thought they were b.f.f.'s forever! Tillerson did a lot of oil business in Russia before becoming Secretary of State,so what soured?

4779 2018-03-13 15:49:12 Rex did have a different quote. Trump just says whatever people want to hear. He’s a walking talking snake oil salesmen.
4780 2018-03-13 15:49:03 What about Mexico? Was that just your Snake Oil Salesman talking?
4781 2018-03-13 15:48:47 Either that or it's the fact that they use soybean oil to cook everything lol
4782 2018-03-13 15:48:31 Who would’ve thought that the president of big oil would be fired by the “president” of the US because he had better morals? Trump sure goes through a lot of people that can’t stooo as low as he does.
4783 2018-03-13 15:48:30 Tried cooking pancakes and some oil fell on the stove top and wham a fire started and I was like well this is how I will go down then 
4784 2018-03-13 15:48:27 You can’t mix oil with water unless you have vinegar?
4785 2018-03-13 15:48:25 REMINDER-Pompeo was the single largest recipient of campaign funds from Koch Bros in 2010.
He came out of the same Wichita,Kansas, biz community where Koch family’s oil-and-gas conglomerate is headquartered.
Pompeo built his own company with seed money from Koch Venture Capital.

4792 2018-03-13 15:47:48 Finally trying out a @beautyandplanet product! Just picked up their Ylang Ylang and Coconut Oil 3 in 1 oil! 
4793 2018-03-13 15:47:38 Woohoo!! Go on John!! Just going to check the oil under the hood 
4794 2018-03-13 15:47:11 i’ve been putting castor oil on my damn lashes for over a year and they still look the same
4795 2018-03-13 15:46:57 @PicknPay blackheath broke al my bones ...oil spil on the floor n there is no one is bothering to clean it ..
4796 2018-03-13 15:46:56 Fortune oil came without 1 ltr extra free... The delivery guy almost went without informing ... I suddenly noticed and pointed it out, he said it got damaged... And then i returned that 5 ltr pack also ... Now I want the thing which i ordered immediately

4798 2018-03-13 15:46:40 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
4799 2018-03-13 15:46:26 Tillerson was supposedly HIRED because he was so friendly with Russia (like Exxon-Russia oil deal and Putin giving him a medal), now he was supposedly FIRED because he was so anti-Russia...
4800 2018-03-13 15:46:25 CBD oil IS legalised Holland and Barrett and Fusion Oils sell them in the UK 
4801 2018-03-13 15:46:23 REMINDER-Pompeo was the single largest recipient of campaign funds from Koch Bros in 2010.
He came out of the same Wichita,Kansas, biz community where Koch family’s oil-and-gas conglomerate is headquartered.
Pompeo built his own company with seed money from Koch Venture Capital.
4802 2018-03-13 15:46:11 But they're the users and producers of oil - they *are* the market. They're not speculators.
4803 2018-03-13 15:46:08 long hair looks that’s trueeeee!! Your fams hair grows so quickly and it’s luscious healthy hair. But....the work  the tangles.. however if you did want to grow your hair longer quicker, using Jamaican Castor Oil helps promote hair growth!
4804 2018-03-13 15:45:56 There are certainly times I wish I played in the big, sexy names like $NFLX, $CMG, etc. But I'd rather buy oil drillers and EM banks. Different strokes for different folks.
4805 2018-03-13 15:45:55 As head of Exxon, Tillerson was an expert on Russian oil industry, so he actually, unlike most of T's appointments, brought expertise to his position, expertise that was relevant to resolving US issues on the Ukraine and Syria. Sad the only adult in T's house has left the room.

4811 2018-03-13 15:45:23 There goes the Big Oil Deal in Siberia ? for Tillerson .

4817 2018-03-13 15:44:50 I think Putin knows Trumps days are numbered and is applying pressure to get the sanctions lifted before he is gone.  If not all Putins money and effort will have been in vain.  Tillerson can go back to screwing over African counties and stealing oil.
4818 2018-03-13 15:44:42 @jiffylube No price on the building. Pull in for a basic oil change. Told it's going to be $45 after they do it. What happened to $19.99?? Tell people when they pull in. This is crap
4819 2018-03-13 15:44:35 Is it oil? watercolor

4821 2018-03-13 15:44:27 While I didn't particularly care for an oil businessman in that position, he atleast tried to promote some semblance of peace and diplomacy. He's replaced by a NeoCon Warhawk. This will be the beginning of ramped up wars in ME and Nuclear standoffs with Russia and China.
4822 2018-03-13 15:44:16 Anybody with a recipe for preparing these mitochondria? Can I use termites instead of oil and onions. Watu Wa "yoo, ptuh ang'aa" keep off
4823 2018-03-13 15:44:09 in the O&G industry this is common. The Cabinda Enclav .... Golf Oil and Chevron along with neighboring concessions operators did a similar work
4824 2018-03-13 15:44:03 Vizag getting iron ore from chattisgarh. Even vizag shipping crude oil from hpcl refinery.

4827 2018-03-13 15:43:55 I also admire how the left can be upset about an oil executive being retained as Secretary of State and then be upset when he’s fired. There’s not much difference.

4830 2018-03-13 15:43:37 About to jump on the essential oil train to see if they work.
4831 2018-03-13 15:43:37 + FRDI bill ... not very politically palatable and still being pushed through .... but dont see why govt should be commended for high oil taxes
4832 2018-03-13 15:43:35 Great thread.  The current narrative is that oil is the new tobacco (permanent value trap due to EV, etc).  The narrative in 1999-2001 was the TMT equity bubble - and that collapsed in 2001-2003.  Seems we need a big drop in the USD and the SPX to make this happen...??
4833 2018-03-13 15:43:34 My stomach is full of filthy rags, engine oil and fridge magnets. That is why I am late.

4848 2018-03-13 15:42:43 It would be advantageous to the Russians if Canada was in such disarray that we couldn't patrol the northern oil fields...er...the Arctic Ocean to curb what they are up to. Maybe Andy could debate that in the HOC.
4849 2018-03-13 15:42:43 He & Trump not seeing eye to eye on all policies. Rex was great oil man. Ran ExxonMobil well. People under him did their jobs. However, Rex not used to swamp & dealing with incompetence in state dept. Very smart man but not a disrupter like Trump. Rex more stay the course guy.

4868 2018-03-13 15:41:40 Imagine firing a man like tillerson- ex ceo of such a mercenary and powerful oil company- by twitter.
4869 2018-03-13 15:41:39 Nate's a smooth operator and can come off as a snake oil salesman, probably due to his Mormon background, but I think you might be pleasantly surprised after you hold your nose, vote for him, and he wins.

4871 2018-03-13 15:41:18 Sounds good to me. Pompeo appears to be a major upgrade from things I’ve read on him. Rex should have been fired a while ago.Bad timing to announce but from accounts he was toast in Jan. You should be happy to, isn’t he an evil oil exec who doesn’t know about diplomatic relations
4872 2018-03-13 15:41:11 I’m dreading going and getting my oil changed. 
4873 2018-03-13 15:41:01 Now, now... let's be fair to Hillary... I'm reasonable sure she smeared at least 60-70% of America by the time you roll in women in blue states who voted for Trump.
4874 2018-03-13 15:40:52 No, he took the State Dept. job so he could help drop Russian sanctions so Exxon could continue to drill. Exxon had purchased $500 billion oil drilling rights in Russia but can’t drill with sanctions in place. It was a quid pro quo.

4878 2018-03-13 15:40:30 3. Sulphur cannot be removed easily like it can in Gasoline and Diesel due to the long chains in fuel oil and residue. I see a refiner not chaning much and taking the extra margin gained in more diesel and LSFO production and taking a hit on less HSFO production
4879 2018-03-13 15:40:26 It was taking too long for Rex to deliver on his promises to Russia to open up oil deals and get rid of sanctions.  Time for a new back channel to the White House.

4881 2018-03-13 15:40:22 The real reason Rex was fired is because Exxon-Mobil is no longer doing the deal with Rosneft to drill for Russian oil.  He was no longer needed.  Why dont you report that instead of following @CNN corporate agenda.

4894 2018-03-13 15:39:29 I'm hoping it was more about the Exxon's oil deal with Russia.
4895 2018-03-13 15:39:10 Yes very much. And yes cannabis oil is so much safer than synthetic opiates.

4900 2018-03-13 15:38:39 Something is fishy:

*Tillerson was given best friend of Russia award by Putin (for work he did at Exxon)
*Trump & Tillerson didn't know each other until Tillerson was nominated for SOS (who recommended him to and WHY?)
*Sanctions stopped oil deal between Exxon & Rosneft
4901 2018-03-13 15:38:31 Not only did Rex not get his oil deal with Putin through, he sold his honor, integrity, and credibility to work in Trump's administration.  Can't feel sorry for him.
4902 2018-03-13 15:38:21 Guess I have no choice but to sit at the shop for 45 mins while my cars gets an oil change

4904 2018-03-13 15:38:05 Well, there goes two narratives. First, the idea that trump just wanted “big oil” to be in his office. Second, the notion that he hates women. Nominates first female head of CIA.

4906 2018-03-13 15:38:04 Money and oil. Major corporations meddled more than Russia.  Rex couldn't close the deal with Russia, so he went home.

4910 2018-03-13 15:37:50 Pushes on renewable energy will make a big difference. It's easier for the EU together to push back on oil companies than any individual state.

But these are problems everyone is grappling with. The EU is not special in this, nor would UK on its own be immune.

4922 2018-03-13 15:36:27 Hope talk is about the oil deal and not because Rex called Trump a moron. Much bigger news here than simple insults.
4923 2018-03-13 15:36:22 I think Tillerson is a sober, thoughtful, analytic. And a successful business man. I think Trump is the opposite and a opportunistic businessman. Oil &water. This to objectivists is the watershed where ANY righteous support or defense, disappears.

4931 2018-03-13 15:35:29 But I always try to follow the feeds and tweet and like and send out retweets!
4932 2018-03-13 15:35:27 Foreign radicals funded by foreign interests, who likely have more interest in keeping CDN resources from market than in "saving the planet"! USA keeps buying our oil below market value while they export theirs at full price!
4933 2018-03-13 15:35:26 So in other news Aeroplan is dropping Imperial Oil as a partner in May and Imperial will then team up with the new Shoppers Drug Loblaws card. That's inconvenient, it used to be a nice way to keep active in Aeroplan unless you are a regular traveller as some are.
4934 2018-03-13 15:35:25 Rex you getting those ExxonMobil oil rigs built off the Fla.coast ? 1st one right by Mar-Lago ?
4935 2018-03-13 15:35:16 I’m trying this for my dogs epilepsy heard great things...he’s only 3 and I don’t want him to start lifelong medication that will harm is liver long term. This oil is a wonder for all sort of human and canine ailments 
4936 2018-03-13 15:35:11 If it's an oil companies jet, does that count?
4937 2018-03-13 15:35:05 Remember when the left hated Tillerson because he represented BIG OIL and all things bad in corporate America.  Now that he's gone, he's being hailed as smart, honest, courageous and reputable. Y'all can't help yourselves. #HateDidThisToYou
4938 2018-03-13 15:35:01 Since nobody buying this sour diesel oil off me ima just smoke it
4939 2018-03-13 15:35:01 Trump firing tillerson is no surprise, and can't say i am too sympathetic to that big oil guy but will give credit where its due and he did stand up for certain things and refused to deny trump was a "fucking moron" ...yet still worked for him so idk? Trump is a big baby
4940 2018-03-13 15:34:59 Also, pay attention to WHY Tillerson was fired (and why Trump won't tell him what he did wrong): Because Tillerson's former company Exxon-Mobil is not doing an oil drilling agreement with Russia. Again: Russia has Trump by the tiny balls.
4941 2018-03-13 15:34:44 American oil companies, especially the large ones, are more environmentally conscious than anywhere else in the world.
4942 2018-03-13 15:34:43 At least now Rex Tillerson has more time to spend extracting oil and mineral reserves from failed states with his "family" at Exxon.

4945 2018-03-13 15:34:41 @RyanZinke is testifying Grandma & grandkids going for a car trip to a #NationalPark should be jacked harder while oil & gas companies should get a break on their leases. Based on just someone's argument. Wait! Now he backpedaled confronted with @SenAngusKing while I was typing.
4946 2018-03-13 15:34:29 .@SenAngusKing: Does the data support the proposed cut in offshore drilling royalties, the impact of taking $ out of taxpayers' pockets? @SecretaryZinke: Oil and gas are doing well. @SenAngusKing : You just made my argument #SENR

4954 2018-03-13 15:33:38 Russia wont risk a conflict for Efrin only. They want oil/gas fields Raqqa Tabqa for that. US wants them to do it so they can hold other parts for good. Thats why US killed 300+ wagners last month to stop deal

4963 2018-03-13 15:32:49 It bears repeating-Tillerson was NEVER qualified to be Secretary of State.He was appointed to shepherd through a post-sanction oil deal between Rosneft & Exxon.He gutted the State Department to disastrous effect, and set the stage for this ill-advised Trump/Kim meeting.
Bye, Rex.

4990 2018-03-13 15:30:23 @aaronecarroll I can no longer take you seriously as a Dr. since your giving legitimacy to a fraud snake oil salesmen like “Dr” Oz. Guess any principles go out the window to sell a book. Sad
4991 2018-03-13 15:30:18 First there was concern Tillerson was too chummy with Putin from past oil deals. Now he's supposed to be the anti-Putin champion? Face it, and look at past inane comments, doesn't matter what Trump does/says, he's opposite. Spoken like a true democrat.
4992 2018-03-13 15:30:17 明日は使ってもらえると信じて眠るよ。
4993 2018-03-13 15:30:16 If you think he “left” his career for this job, you’re naive. He’s still the majority share holder of Exxon. He only took this job to confirm his Russian oil drilling deal. It didn’t work out so trump got rid of him once he saw that Rex is going against Russian. Can’t have that.

4997 2018-03-13 15:29:53 The oil is a burden at present!! The price per barrel is irrelevant, it’s the revenue that matters. At the moment with extraction & associated costs it’s actually costing us to extract. Why don’t you google some of the pish you spout, and educate yourself? 
Too scared?
4998 2018-03-13 15:29:36 We were told lifting the crude oil export ban would eliminate the Brent/WTI spread. Impressive how the experts were wrong about absolutely everything they said to get the ban lifted. EIA expects WTI to average $4/b lower than Brent prices in both 2018 and 2019. 

Wrong? Or lying?
4999 2018-03-13 15:29:34 Why not? He probably hired him because Putin told him to.  How else would an oil CEO that Trump didn’t even know suddenly become his Secretary of State? One that already had a relationship and business relations with Putin...

Huh. Zinke saying how very well the oil industry is doing
5022 2018-03-13 15:27:42 I’m in my dealer for an oil change and so is everybody else
5023 2018-03-13 15:27:41 Zinke: "the oil and gas industry is doing very well."

Also Zinke: "We should give the oil and gas industry more financial breaks at the taxpayers' expense."

5027 2018-03-13 15:27:16 More like "No Russian Oil Deal/No sanctions lifted. Tillerson made statement on UK spy poisoning upon his carefully orchestrated exit"
5028 2018-03-13 15:27:07 Dumph fired Exonboy because he was not needed anymore in the Russian oil deal in Siberia.  They could not get the sanctions removed.  With dumph's low profile, working illegally around these sanctions is facing too much attention.  (SAD)

5035 2018-03-13 15:25:40 it implies clean cracks will have to price higher to incentivise simple margins to fill the demand.

5037 2018-03-13 15:25:35 And what seems to be the real tragedy is that it did not have to be.  Other than the fact that the US wanted an oil pipeline to run one way and Assad planned to run it another way, what was. and/or is, the compelling interest of the US in the internal affairs of Syria?

5063 2018-03-13 15:22:59 Boston has just been hit by its 3rd serious storm in less than two weeks.   They drain local budgets as we scramble to get infrastructure accessible. 

I applaud the lawsuits going after oil companies for hiding the science on climate devastation. I consider them civilly liable.
5064 2018-03-13 15:22:55 I bet he's a big Clay Travis fan. Sounds like someone who buys the snake oil by the barrel.
5065 2018-03-13 15:22:53 Never been happier to receive a call from my mom that mike Pompeo , the one who believes data and math Mater, is replacing an oil exec BUT @pureflatulence regardless I have to focus on me

5068 2018-03-13 15:22:43 An oil executive is out as sec. of state and is replaced by the head of the CIA. If nothing else, power is explicitly unimaginative in the Trump administration. #RexTillerson

5073 2018-03-13 15:22:29 They had no use for Tillerson anymore, as Exxon announced 3-1-18 that it had ended the Russia deal. Tillerson failed Putin by not getting their (Putin-Tillerson-Exxon) big oil deal green lighted

5077 2018-03-13 15:22:12 However, Exxon oil is not flowing as it should from Russia, so maybe the dividends Trump expected haven't been forthcoming!

5081 2018-03-13 15:21:56 Milquetoast response, Chuck. He got canned for failing to get that big Russian oil deal through and then having the gall to say Russia killed that spy in Britain. You need to say these things out loud.

5085 2018-03-13 15:21:40 There is still no words leaving the mouth of @TurnbullMalcolm or @JoshFrydenberg to suggest GOV will ban #GreatAustralianBight #oil drilling
5086 2018-03-13 15:21:33 I can't scream loud enough. 45 has allowed murder of hybernating animals, animal babies, destroying artic climate, wants to destroy pristine coastlines, and is allowing oil drilling in our natl parks. he was exactly what previous admin protected parks from. he must be stopped.

5089 2018-03-13 15:21:21 Just now, @SenCortezMasto asked Sec. Zinke, "If this admin is committed to…all-of-the-above energy strategy, then why is renewable energy the only energy program that is proposed being cut?" But oil drilling gets a boost.

There's not really a good answer for this good question.

5094 2018-03-13 15:20:41 So a retired Oil company CEO didn't have the knowledge, experience, or personality to be Sec of State?
Whoever woulda thunk it?
Besides everybody I mean?
5095 2018-03-13 15:20:39 Edmonton always had less oil company office jobs, therefore less to lose in that category.
5096 2018-03-13 15:20:38 Yeah, a good team if you're a tool of the oil lobby, war industry. We need peace makers, now more than ever. Not these bad actors.

5099 2018-03-13 15:20:30 I remember cnn being outraged about Tillerson being SOC. He was part of the collusion, his business dealings with Russia in the oil business

Secret Gov't thinks that is a fair trade-off. Note UK getting twitchy<- EU partner. UK wiling to go to War to get control of UK Gov't...
5104 2018-03-13 15:19:56 It's forgien companies who don't want Canadian oil on the market  it bring prices down  along with profit. 6 billion a year is not enough
5105 2018-03-13 15:19:53 That big Exxon-Russian oil deal you hired Tillerson for, fell through.
We all knew his days were numbered after that!

5107 2018-03-13 15:19:42 He failed to implement sanctions and scuttled the group that specializes in it.

He spent none of the money allocated to fighting assaults on our cyber-security.

Most of all, for him, he saw the Russia / Exxon joint Arctic oil drilling project go down the toilet.

Yeah he failed

5110 2018-03-13 15:19:34 45 won't be happy until he has destroyed all natural resources and beautiful places this country has to offer. prove to us we need this oil before drilling starts. isn't US selling oil to other countries?
5111 2018-03-13 15:19:31 A los q hablan de oil combustible no pago un puto impuesto, así cualquiera
5112 2018-03-13 15:19:27 That's why I was surprised.  As the CEO of Exxon Mobile, I reckon Tillerson's interests are aligned with BIG OIL/GAS.  I suspect he favored the Saudi/Qatar plan to run gas lines through Syria, which Assad rejected in 2009.  From that point on Assad had a target on his back
5113 2018-03-13 15:19:01 I use cannabis oil for pain, no more narcotics due to them ruining my teeth.
5114 2018-03-13 15:18:49 I wonder how the Putin-Tillerson Exxon oil deal will ever happen now that Putin got mad at Rex and made Trump fire him. How will Putin get those damn sanctions lifted now?

5121 2018-03-13 15:18:22 Yeah, seemed like a reasonable dude (for a oil exec). You can tell he never really drank the kool-aid...probably the reason he was always on the outside. 

Gotta also give him credit for calling orange lunatic a “f*cking moron”. didn’t deny/apologize.

5124 2018-03-13 15:18:04 I thought the left talking point was that Tillerson was proof of Russian collusion given his ties there as an oil exec. Now, firing him is proof of collusion. I just love evolving narratives!

5127 2018-03-13 15:17:47 "A graduate of West Point and Harvard and a former Republican congressman, Mike Pompeo is widely seen as more of a loyalist than Tillerson, a former oil executive who had not met Trump before the election and grew increasingly at odds with the president’s style and policies"

5134 2018-03-13 15:17:13 Next step: drop the sanctions against Russia so that Tillison can resume his position at Exxon so they can explore for oil in Russia And the oligarchs can get richer and Trumps debt to Russia can be paid off and The 20 richest people in the world can keep buying GOP elections!

5161 2018-03-13 15:15:02 Now Tillerson can lobby openly Trump to lift  sanctions against Russia, where Exxon has Half trillion$ invested in oil exploration; Trump needs to lift them as a payback to Putin for Russian  oligarchs’ money invested in Trump’s failing business & for helping Trump win election.
5162 2018-03-13 15:15:01 Rex Tillerson,
I will full admit that I didn't think your appointment was a good idea as you'd be a stooge for Big Oil and the Russians. I don't know about oil, but you did your job with regards to calling out the Russians.

You were right, @realDonaldTrump is, in fact, a moron.
5163 2018-03-13 15:14:59 The Nation calls Pompeo the “Koch Brothers’ Favorite Congressman” for accepting more than $375,000 from Koch Industries over the course of his political career, as well as more than $1 million from the oil and gas industry in general. Mike Pompeo is a climate change denier.
5164 2018-03-13 15:14:57 Yup now Tillerson can go back to the Oil Business & ride the Gravy Train until Renewables take over.
5165 2018-03-13 15:14:54 I think it has to do with Trump’s cut of the trillion dollars he would get from that 63 million acres of Russian oil drilling. He only gets it if sanctions are lifted! His corruption is only exceeded by his greed!
5166 2018-03-13 15:14:52 Getting an oil change so when they are done they can tell me I need new tires too. 
5167 2018-03-13 15:14:44 @SenCortezMasto asks @SecretaryZinke why renewables are only energy program being cut, and he claims that solar is single use - which IS true for oil & gas drilling and mining!

5182 2018-03-13 15:13:29 Well I guess all Russian oil deals that could have gone are no kaput.
5183 2018-03-13 15:13:09 @maddow @JoyAnnReid Tillerson was fired weeks after Exxon announced it was pulling out of Russian Oil agreement. Pompeo was interviewed weeks ago by sanctioned Russian leaders during their visit to the states. Connected?

5186 2018-03-13 15:12:59 Ok look i didn't like having an oil magnate for a secretary of state, and tbh i havent been keeping up with the news so much, but i kind of feel like the only person worse for the job than a gasoline CEO is the guy who's job is to fucking spy on/rendition the rest of the world

5188 2018-03-13 15:12:50 It's weird to think that Rex Tillerson was, by many accounts, a more moderate member of Trump's cabinet. Especially considering that he probably has a trophy room with the mounted, oil sludge-soaked heads of various coastal wildlife.

5196 2018-03-13 15:12:04 Short day at work today. Leaving at noon, getting some oil for the car, picking up the kiddo from school, then Doc appointment then rest.
5197 2018-03-13 15:11:50 How would this look for oil right now?
5198 2018-03-13 15:11:44 hahaha cutie. Have you tried using castor oil?
5199 2018-03-13 15:11:43 uhm well said. Just not sure that all we got is the oil, what if we got nothin' but rust?
5200 2018-03-13 15:11:36 @patmynec and @ElegantAngelxxx Can you plz give us the hint of release date of @MaddyOreillyxxx & @JamesDeen scene? #Oil Explosion 3 Dying to see this scene!
5201 2018-03-13 15:11:35 I feel that. After a yr I finally have my fro back lol. Idk what you moisturize with, but I think Jamaican castor oil is great for stimulating growth
5202 2018-03-13 15:11:34 ...because being dependent on foreign oil is of the highest value. When our uniparty engages in war, we can blame it on the Republican's lust for oil and win re-election time and time again!
5203 2018-03-13 15:11:33 Must be in the wrong career as #RexTillerson worth 300 million. Maybe should go into oil and gas lol
5204 2018-03-13 15:11:30 From an oil  executive to a sacked Secretary of state. 
5205 2018-03-13 15:11:30 Those countries don’t want us there at all but they don’t kick us out either. Our trade deficit doesn’t mean we aren’t self , we have oil, gas, timber, etc it means we can’t exploit our own cheap labor, we trade that out & we consume 2 much junk
5206 2018-03-13 15:11:23 Exxon needs him back.There are lots of new uspoiled places to exploit and make uninhabitable with oil drilling and subsequent spills.Thank's el Presidente.
5207 2018-03-13 15:11:20 Some places are just too special to drill. @Interior should withdraw oil and gas leases on land near the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument #KeepItPublic
5208 2018-03-13 15:11:20 Saw it coming. Rex had started to look like he might be a good guy.
1. Exxon cancelled that oil deal
2. Respectable, sensible, pragmatic on 60 Minutes
3. Told reporters Russia attacked our friends with poison, & of course, we would react
5209 2018-03-13 15:11:08 Then oil rigs will fit in perfectly. I’m curious, did any local media cover Trump Admin’s proposal to allow biz owners to keep all their employees tips - and redistribute as deemed fit, or just keep the cash themselves? I’m sure the career bartenders are cool with that
5210 2018-03-13 15:11:02 My husband and I work in a oil blending company. We also own some shares in it. So yeah... we take oil money. He is a chemical coordinator and I’m a Lab supervisor. His duty is mostly quality assurance and Im in charge of staff supervision and recruitment of new employees.
5211 2018-03-13 15:10:57 About to find out this weekend for the Lucas Oil shows. #letsgetitgoin
5212 2018-03-13 15:10:56 3) National preserve land is being sold for oil and gas exploitation, while the rest of the world will profit from investment in renewable energy.
4) A wealthy nincompoop is Sec of Education, intent on selling schools to for profit businesses
5213 2018-03-13 15:10:48 Russia loves Tillerson and the oil deals more than they care about him calling out chemical attack. This might be because there is new evidence that Putin ordered Trump to appoint Tillerson? Rexit

5217 2018-03-13 15:10:20 Rex Tillerson was told his services were no longer needed on Friday. Recently, Exxon called off their 500 billion oil deal with Russia. Gee, I wonder if there is a connection?
5218 2018-03-13 15:10:16 Rex Tillerson self made man. Made his millions in  oil.
5219 2018-03-13 15:10:08 Endless oil story
5220 2018-03-13 15:10:07 Perhaps because they are international crimes ?  Perhaps involving countries whose relationship with us is tenuous?   Perhaps related to oil or terrorism or who knows what?
5221 2018-03-13 15:10:02 Putin's testing the fences. First doing the not-so secret barge offloading out to sea supplying NK w/ oil during sanctions.

5227 2018-03-13 15:09:29 #OOTT | The average monthly increase (in shale output) in the eight months since September is 155,000 bpd. This would see shale oil production soar by 1.5 million bpd within a year enough to cover the total increase in global oil demand. cc. @commerzbank #WTI #Brent #Oil

5236 2018-03-13 15:08:30 So Tillerson spoke the truth about Russian assassinations and that was to much, I knew that would happen, you still haven't enforced the Russian Sanctions already passed into Law by Congress, I know your Bestie #VladimirPutin approves. So Much For Oil!
5237 2018-03-13 15:08:29 Agreed

5253 2018-03-13 15:07:32 U.S. just became the largest exporter of oil in the world. Mission accomplished, Rex Tillerson, former Exxon Mobil CEO. Now, onto someone who can deal with the NOKO-Iran mess Obama intentionally created - and clean up the State Department.

5273 2018-03-13 15:05:28 but with all his trying, he could not get the oil deals going again in Russia---Putin doesn't wait long before he replaces his own. Pompeo has shown he has the skills necessary for keeping DJT's boots clean.

5307 2018-03-13 15:03:07 Not a mystery. Exxon had a 500 BILLION dollar oil exploration deal with Russia. Tillerson was the head of oil exploration for Exxon. That’s why Trump made Tillerson Secretary of State. The oil deal with Russia fell through. Now there is no need for Tillerson.

5330 2018-03-13 15:01:14 Lol..we ate one in school those days, boys were broke and we had one very big cocoa yam idling around. We boiled the nigga and ate it with palm oil. It was sweet.
5331 2018-03-13 15:01:12 Its oil not tar
5332 2018-03-13 15:01:07 gold doesn't follow oil
5333 2018-03-13 15:01:00 Dylan is interested in applying data science to reservoir characterization, modeling, and simulation. His current focus is on a novel thermally enhanced oil recovery (TEOR) technology, the Solvent Thermal Resource Innovation Process (STRIP).
5334 2018-03-13 15:00:58 A very soft reintroduction to Scottish political program. Philanthropy in Africa very worthy....oil?  'Ho ho I won't get involved in hard politics'  he says. Pity he made a mess of it in 2014. What a nice chap say the uninvolved watching at home...
5335 2018-03-13 15:00:54 Six years and many oil changes later I still love hearing “earl change”

5337 2018-03-13 15:00:48 Hahaha trying. Mauubos ko na nga yung sleep well oil ko eh! Ahahaha
5338 2018-03-13 15:00:46 So the brilliant residents of Delmarva are cool with Trump’s EPA removing pollution regs for Chesapeake Bay and chicken farms, but wind turbines a couple miles off shore is outrageous; are they fine with oil rigs instead?

5347 2018-03-13 15:00:12 I love pronteh but they make me feel like a sack of OIL after I've eaten them 
5348 2018-03-13 15:00:11 It's a bit like someone working with a canvas and oil paints.  Then someone with a crayon walks up and asks if they can help.  Lowering the barrier of entry is not always a good thing.  :-)
5349 2018-03-13 15:00:05 I believe Tillerson was there for one reason only- there some kind of oil or natural gas deals he could facilitate. Dismantling the State Dept. insured that Tillerson could accomplish .. something without too many other people in the mix.
5350 2018-03-13 15:00:03 Today's pizza has red bell pepper, onion, Kalamata olive, caper, Valbreso feta and mozzarella cheese, garlic olive oil, and parsley
5351 2018-03-13 15:00:02 India must buy oil from Venezuela
5352 2018-03-13 14:59:59 I have no idea why an ex oil man was not successful leading foreign policy for a real estate developer and TV host. @seanhannity @BillOReilly
5353 2018-03-13 14:59:58 Oh no :( Funny...my @AntinnyWorld has been dealing with that - he's getting his allergies under control and that should help. Supposedly it is what triggers sinus infections. So Zyrtec and nasonex every day and avoiding soybean oil and sugars etc. I hope u feel better. 
5354 2018-03-13 14:59:55 Raging? Gas prices up, heating oil up and cold winter here. Grocery prices up. Can’t touch fresh produce due to lack of farm workers. Nor’easters back to back, climate change asswipe. Everything went up in price. Only good for you since you grift off the taxpayers.
5355 2018-03-13 14:59:37 You are talking on principle terms but not practical terms. Majority of today's churches are now in profitable business. They sell books by papa, anointing oil,miracle maize, miracle oranges, miracle bananas, miracle apples, wrist bands & lease properties. We look at the reality.
5356 2018-03-13 14:59:23 If Mcavoy for eg. projected to make the impact he has that quick he wouldn’t’ve gone 14th overall. Its obv an unknown but the with the cap situation they need cheap bets going fwd. I’d rather bet on that than giving up a potential stud + klef for an OEL who oil can afford for 1yr
5357 2018-03-13 14:59:18 Coffee? Or oil (Exxon?)

5362 2018-03-13 14:58:54 During floods fish eats ants and when flood recedes, ants eat fish. Only time matters. To make soap, oil is required. But to clean oil, soap is required. This is the irony of life. No one is self sufficient. Everybody needs somebody at one  point in time.
5363 2018-03-13 14:58:53 Runs on vegetable oil........ do your research
5364 2018-03-13 14:58:38 Ian Wood already has, lying, cheating, traitor bastard that he is. 
My auntie used to work for him when he was still in the fish trade, before he changed into an oil expert, she said he never spoke to the workers or thanked them, he was a dick then & he still is.
5365 2018-03-13 14:58:34 How much is the oil
5366 2018-03-13 14:58:29 Now Rex can go back to the Oil Business & ride the Gravy Train until Renewables take over.

5368 2018-03-13 14:58:22 Knowing Tillerson would no longer be needed for the $500 Billion Dollar Oil Deal with Russia Trump has no use for Till the pill.
5369 2018-03-13 14:58:21 Follow the money:
-Tillerson criticises Putin, ostensibly angering DT
-giving DT cover to fire Rex
-then DT lifts #RussiaSanctions 
-Rex is free to pursue the $500B oil deal he previously brokered w/Putin
-does DT get a cut?!
5370 2018-03-13 14:58:19 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,

5372 2018-03-13 14:58:09 If Broncos really want to embrace the QB controversy, I hear Tillerson is a free agent now.

Can't sack a former Exxon CEO — he'll be covered in crude oil and way too slippery to bring down.

Think about it Elway
5373 2018-03-13 14:58:08 @business @markets @VonnieQuinn:Tell this #MichaelTran that OPEC screwed up the oil mkt a long time ago when they went all out productioning
5374 2018-03-13 14:58:01 I’d say the CEO of a large oil company and wealthy influential donor would have more influence than a cabinet lackey
5375 2018-03-13 14:57:46 Trump is making the ex-CEO of an oil company sound like a folk hero.
5376 2018-03-13 14:57:40 I’m hoping this new oil I bought helps. Coz wow, my hair is doing the most 
5377 2018-03-13 14:57:36 This is how bad things have gotten. People knew that Rex was buddy buddy with Putin & that whole $500M oil deal and now some are mad he is gone to be replaced with a war wanting, money wasting professional spy. #Resist #TrumpsSinkingShip #TrumpIsATraitor

5379 2018-03-13 14:57:32 I got up early to get a oil change at Walmart and them niggas was like “oh we not doing oil changes we are short staffed” only in the bay smh
5380 2018-03-13 14:57:31 The auto shop where I get my car's oil change has HGTV, not Fox, on the TV. This is a big deal.
5381 2018-03-13 14:57:24 I wonder if Till rson was able to nail down that Russia-Exxon oil deal before he was fired?
5382 2018-03-13 14:57:22 U should have never appointed an unqualified oil exec to State Department in first place. 99% of your cabinet is incompetent and/or corrupt. That includes .@potus, as well.

5384 2018-03-13 14:57:06 What did Rossi get you?
5385 2018-03-13 14:57:05 Hmmm...I don’t know if any facial mists, but when my face is super dry, I like to apply coconut oil and leave it on over night then in the morning just wash my face with water. That’s what usually helps me with dry skin .
5386 2018-03-13 14:57:02 Bitchhh u fucking up ya engine go get a damn oil change
5387 2018-03-13 14:56:59 Why does he say 'congratulations to all!' when Rex is on the tweet? Was that Trump just being an idiot or was it a last kick in the a$$ to Tillerson?  Tilly only took the job to work with Russia on oil so I'm glad he's fired

5401 2018-03-13 14:55:58 My guess is Rex Tillerson will B hiding out from the Russian Mob and/or Bob Mueller. I think Tillerson is on the run, Out of the country 2 some safe house in Canada, where there are *other* Oil Execs like him, in their hideaways in frozen Saskatchewan. #TillersonIsOnTheRun 1/2

5412 2018-03-13 14:55:30 It's so ridiculous when everyone was saying Tillerson was a Russian Oil Stooge of Putin's!
5413 2018-03-13 14:55:30 Bots got em anger oil this time maybe instead of coolant
5414 2018-03-13 14:55:24 You just lost the oil industry.
5415 2018-03-13 14:55:23 @HillaryClinton When out and about it's prudent to wear shoes that are conducive to the surrounding conditions, particularly souls that are soft, oil resistance etc. The alternative is looking good while falling on your $&+..
5416 2018-03-13 14:55:23 I actually thought Rex Tillerson did a decent job, considering he was the former head of an oil company and he has the most Texas name ever.
5417 2018-03-13 14:55:09 As the Petrochemical Industry provides more and more materials for auto parts replacing heavier and more expensive parts of aluminum and steel the oil and gas industry will be able to redirect its products from inside the tank to the outside of the car....oil’s not going away!

5421 2018-03-13 14:54:58 And building large unused cities and highways is better?  It’s called healthy tension.  Otherwise, you end up with folks like Roger Ver spamming the blockchain to further his agenda.  Another good parallel is when the cost of oil was high it drove alt energy investment up.
5422 2018-03-13 14:54:58 DWT manual close 12.81 +3.6% gain. OIL gaps and runs lower, some room left lower still, but momentum slows.
5423 2018-03-13 14:54:50 Will you extend to beard oil/wax or specialise solely in the upper lip?
Asking for my chin.
5424 2018-03-13 14:54:47 That and Rex couldn't get the oil deal to go through. Exxon withdrew last week then a couple days later Rex is fired. He had one job and he failed.
5425 2018-03-13 14:54:42 Reese it didn't make sense at all the cold not gon preserve oil who the fuck told u that
5426 2018-03-13 14:54:39 I dunno, maybe 5-10% of the price of WTI oil was the fact Rex Tillerson was Secretary of State? $CL_F
5427 2018-03-13 14:54:37 Worse than Chris oil 
5428 2018-03-13 14:54:35 We all know that Rex was put in place by the Russians to facilitate the massive oil deal they were counting on.
 Why does that not concern you, Lindsey?
5429 2018-03-13 14:54:26 And 2 months after the Exxon/Russian oil deal crashed.

5432 2018-03-13 14:54:22 the artwork could be an oil lamp in the dark with a strand of red hair and Chiltons cane laid next to it

5440 2018-03-13 14:54:06 Add five pounds of olive oil then whisk briskly.
5441 2018-03-13 14:53:58 How about a death penalty for politicians who wage war over biblical nonsense or oil control or banking control
5442 2018-03-13 14:53:58 And the crude oil whipsaw remains alive and well.  To say it is voliatile would be like saying the sun is hot.
5443 2018-03-13 14:53:52 Oil change on deck...

He supports NSA ‘data collection’ (invasion of privacy).

5448 2018-03-13 14:53:16 Tillerson calls out Russia’s poison attack in the UK. Guess the Black Sea oil money just isn’t worth Putin’s death guarantee for disloyalty.

And Trump still hasn’t imposed bipartisan sanctions against Russia.

5453 2018-03-13 14:53:04 @VonnieQuinn @SheryAhnNews   ahhhhh; they switched your names in the beginning on the oil market segment.
5454 2018-03-13 14:52:59 I read the news today, oh boy...about an oil man who couldn't stay. And though the news was rather sad, well, I just had to laugh. It didn't stop the graft.

5459 2018-03-13 14:52:38 After we step back from the insanity of the Tillerson firing, are we gonna take a moment to ask and answer why a CEO of an oil company w/no gov't or policy experience was Sec of State?
5460 2018-03-13 14:52:38 No thank you! The clock is running out on climate change. We need someone who's willing to stand up to oil and gas.

5463 2018-03-13 14:52:23 Stay short on oil, our short is up over 150 points
5464 2018-03-13 14:52:16 99.99% of crude oil traders do not know how crude oil is traded.
5465 2018-03-13 14:52:16 It bothers me that Rex Tillerson wasn’t fired for being an unqualified oil executive, but rather for telling the truth about Russia.  #TraitorTrump #TrumpColluded
5466 2018-03-13 14:51:43 Tillerson was the one big surprise for me, in a good way. Despite being a former oil executive he was the one not throwing mud, and appeared to be the one with integrity. I'm not surprised he is asked to step down. A shame though.
5467 2018-03-13 14:51:42 I did the deed and now I'm getting an oil change. Productivity before noon.
5468 2018-03-13 14:51:33 The best response to the #Russian #NerveGasAttack in the #UK is to #DrillBabyDrill! Drive the price down on oil and gas! Take $BILLIONS out of #Putin's pocket! (Also get $BILLIONS more in revenue to the US!)
5469 2018-03-13 14:51:25 So the oil exec is out at State, but now we have a right-wing hardliner ideologue who wants a war with Iran and to have Snowden executed. Lovely.

5473 2018-03-13 14:50:59 I remember Cenk said Rex being hired is proof of Trump being a puppet and they will lift the sanctions for the oil deal, I suspect he will say him being fired is proof of Trump being a puppet
5474 2018-03-13 14:50:55 What is worse is that we are now importing much less oil close to nothing...US is one of the biggest if not the biggest oil producer...why is our gas more expensive than other countries? We pay third world country gas prices in America
5475 2018-03-13 14:50:52 Only reason this referendum was happening was to increase stakes with baghdad on cash negotiations ... now they want baghdad to manage the airport cuz they are broke kurds will never claim independence they take 17% of  oil for doing nothing. independence is for local consumption

5477 2018-03-13 14:50:38 Sen. @RonWyden to @SecretaryZinke: "First, you pushed the largest reduction of conserved public land in the country..second you proposed opening America's treasured coasts to offshore oil drilling."
5478 2018-03-13 14:50:34 Tillerson calls out Russia’s poison attack in the UX. Guess the Black Sea oil money just isn’t worth Putin’s death guarantee for disloyalty.

And Trump still hasn’t imposed bipartisan sanctions against Russia.

5480 2018-03-13 14:50:25 He left his blossoming career as head of an oil giant to work for a crazy narcissist.
5481 2018-03-13 14:50:23 He wont there is this 3 trillion oil deal with Russia ...
5482 2018-03-13 14:50:20 Hillary just stated that the right wing conspiracy sprayed oil on the steps.
5483 2018-03-13 14:50:16 Do you not think that if rail was the preferred option that these oil companies would bother trying to get pipelines built? It is an antiquated idea and a more expensive option of the two. We have a backlog of grain in the praries and you believe more oil shipments will help lol.

5497 2018-03-13 14:49:21 Yes, Trump has no shame, but  with the promise of oil money in his pocket & development deals across Russia, “The Don” is completely giddy with greed. Trump should have been prosecuted decades ago - our system failures are deeper & of longer duration than many want to believe...
5498 2018-03-13 14:49:17 End the top tax rate for citizens since 50% of people don’t pay taxes anyway! More importantly cut spending, end federal social program, abolish the IRS, & the Fed, sunset social security & reform medicare & put the dollar on gold/silver/oil/lumber

NO SANCTIONS will be lifted!
No Oil drilling!
Stuck fighting in Syria doesn’t look like We & Putin taking over Syria’s &Oil!
5500 2018-03-13 14:49:04 That Tillerson is an experienced oil man and a real go getter. Another country will snatch him up in a heartbeat. Bolivia and Zaire have already called.

5504 2018-03-13 14:48:53 Unfortunately I'm sure no liberal women will even mention it, doesn't fit the narrative
5505 2018-03-13 14:48:53 You allowing the nomination of an unqualified oil executive to be appointed to the 2nd most powerful position in gov, tasked w/keeping America safe is disgraceful. 
Every day you, and the rest of the GOP, continue to keep your heads up DT's ass, is putting us all in grave danger.
5506 2018-03-13 14:48:47 Tillerson -former chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil- has gone because Exxon just ended their partnership with Russian state oil company Rosneft, citing sanctions. The  $500bn russian arctic deal he was put in place to facilitate is off.
5507 2018-03-13 14:48:46 May crude oil never run dry
5508 2018-03-13 14:48:45 Rex Tillerson fired 4the only reason #trump fires people; He was disloyal. He called T a "moron" & while setting up side oil deals in Africa, he was telling them T was his fool

5516 2018-03-13 14:48:20 My favorite thing about Rex Tillerson is that if you just said his name to someone who didn’t know who he was, the first thing they’d guess about him is “oil exec turned failed US Secretary of State with the face of an evil Muppet.”

5526 2018-03-13 14:47:16 Some people take olive oil super seriously, which is weird because it's grease squeezed out of tree turds and that doesn't seem like something that should be worth much.

5536 2018-03-13 14:46:33 I thought the opposite.  Tillerson was only there because of his position with Exxon.  Once the sanctions were lifted, they would have jumped on the oil Cash cow in Russia. Tillerson had previous business dealings with them

5545 2018-03-13 14:45:29 It was all preplanned before the election. He was brought in to destroy the capabilities of the State Department, get sanctions lifted against Russia for the massive oil deal and then leave.
5546 2018-03-13 14:45:28 don't be NAIVE! Tillerson was hoping to get relieved of "duty" after he gutted State Department and kept sanctions from being implemented so that  half-trillion $$$ oil deal Rosneft, of which he is part, can go through. I have primary source docs from Tillerson's former colleague

5610 2018-03-13 14:40:18 Absolutely!!! When taking lashes off I’ve found the best, least evasive way to remove is to take said oil cleanser/ remover, soak a cotton ball/pad and leaving it on the eye for 30 seconds- 1 minute. Then GENTLY wiggle and pull and the lashes, glue, and mascara slide off!

5616 2018-03-13 14:40:01 Tillerson is out because Exxon-Mobil finally called off their attempt at a joint venture with Russian oil company Rosneft to drill in arctic water because sanctions could not be lifted. He was chosen for the role to expand US oil interests abroad- all else is a distraction.
5617 2018-03-13 14:40:00 The @StateDept has a long history, dating back to WW2, of being more concerned with protecting the interests of the Big Oil Companies than the interests of the United States of America,

Mike Pompeo will bring a fresh and principled new approach to the role of Secretary of State.
5618 2018-03-13 14:39:47 yesterday one sheep was calling for 75 oil. i told him its going to 55 ,he blocked me. lol..

5620 2018-03-13 14:39:31 I hope someone interviews him and he is able to talk about "the idiot" that he worked for. Is the next guy a crony for another multinational oil corp? We already know Pompeo is ride-or-die for the Kochs after his op-ed...
5621 2018-03-13 14:39:30 BOST has sold about 1.8m litres of crude oil to an unlicensed company on a cheap-Duncan Amoah (COPEC). #Ekosiis3n @koo_twum @ekosiisen @kwadade109 @moshoosho

5624 2018-03-13 14:39:04 In business that’s disrespectful, and Tillerson is from business and has just been given his Thor hammer back, should be interesting to see if the oil sanctions stay or go now remember that was an Exxon deal not a government one
5625 2018-03-13 14:38:56 
5626 2018-03-13 14:38:55 If you can't do your own oil change don't talk to me, I understand being to lazy but not knowing at all how to do it is just ridiculous
5627 2018-03-13 14:38:49 GREAT move to replace Tillerson. He is the oil monopoly emperor and was not appropriate in the Sec of State position. Pompeo seems to be a great alternative and choice. We're praying for you. (See Chap 8 "Energy Policy" in "When I Am President-The President's Bible")

5632 2018-03-13 14:38:26 Lmfaoo i put my car through a rigorous trial when I’m fresh off a oil change
5633 2018-03-13 14:38:19 I certainly agree with that. But the work that is being done to assure the people of BC gets eroded quickly when the ones promoting the pipeline send out bs about tanker safety. Saying oil tankers are “PERFECTLY HARMLESS” is the equivalent of saying “SHUT DOWN THE OIL INDUSTRY”
5634 2018-03-13 14:38:15 I don't think those living on the coast fully understand how much our oil impacts their standard of living, I think it's time we showed them. I think it would bring down their minority government if their cost of living suddenly went drastically up.
5635 2018-03-13 14:38:13 Tillerson’s sole job was getting the sanctions lifted so Putin could get Exxon expertise to access Siberian oil fields. Since that’s off the table, he was expendable. #MuellerTime @BobSMueller #MuellerIsHere
5636 2018-03-13 14:38:12 Well, she damn sure wasn't going to be a business major with that ability to judge a ROI.
5637 2018-03-13 14:38:04 Let's remember: This is the same bunch that confirmed 25-year CEO of Exxon who was awarded highest Russian honor and had $9 trillion deal with Russian oil that just needed sanctions lifted by State Dept. (Who said in hearings that he was no longer with Exxon and couldn't comment)
5638 2018-03-13 14:37:58 Is @SecretaryZinke really saying veterans, seniors and 4th graders should pay MORE to visit our #nationalparks? This guy needs to remember he works for the people, not the oil industry!

5642 2018-03-13 14:37:56 So i guess being presidential means being a snake oil salesman. Ill gladly take honest...
5643 2018-03-13 14:37:54 I knowww I haven’t been going a lot of places that’s why I haven’t needed an oil change in so long
5644 2018-03-13 14:37:50 Trump does create a lot of jobs, by constantly firing the people he hires. What a joke! Although, hiring an oil CEO to run our State Department gave us a clear view of the corruption that Trump was bringing to Washington.

5647 2018-03-13 14:37:06 Yeah but without parades they won't have new recruits.  I mean in this GREATEST  economy, who would enlist to fight for big oil?

5657 2018-03-13 14:36:03 No. You said it was because of the failed oil deal. If that were true Tillerson would’ve resigned in a more controlled fashion. I’ve been in the TYT army since 2004, but chest beating is gettting really old.

5661 2018-03-13 14:35:30 Never liked how Tillerson went along w gutting State Dept. As oil exec he seemed woefully unprepared for wider range of issues SOS deals with , but at least he's intelligent & rational .. not going to start war on a whim.. Guess Trump couldn't accept Tillerson condemning Putin.

5663 2018-03-13 14:35:26 I rather have an oil executive than a CIA director lead the military industrial complex. This is bad news.
5664 2018-03-13 14:35:09 President Trump signed an executive order directing the BLM to review—and potentially revise or rescind—a 2015 rule to set well integrity and other safety standards for oil and gas wells using hydraulic fracturing on public lands
5665 2018-03-13 14:35:09 Big oil deal fell apart last week.   REXXON will now work on it from the outside.   Media has really dropped the ball
5666 2018-03-13 14:35:02 Exxon/Mobile pulled out of their Russia oil deal. Hence no use for him any longer.
5667 2018-03-13 14:34:56 Follow the money:
-Tillerson criticises Putin, ostensibly angering DT
-giving DT cover to fire Rex
-then DT lifts #RussiaSanctions 
-Rex is free to pursue the $500B oil deal he previously brokered w/Putin
-does DT get a cut?!

5680 2018-03-13 14:33:59 We all thought Rex would be sucking Putin's d for Exxon oil money, turns out he actually had some backbone. Which is more than I can say about Donny. He's still sucking Putin's d. That's why he slurs so much.

If this was Putin's decision, then did Putin also order Trump to kill 100 of his mercenaries in Syria or  to give defensive arms to Ukraine?

5705 2018-03-13 14:32:03 He might have been appointed because Russia pressured Trump to do so. The State Dept. was extremely understaffed. And he was an oil tycoon. But he typically had more sense when it came to diplomacy than Trump so it's a mixed bag

5742 2018-03-13 14:28:29 It’s scary to think  when people like Tillerson (Oil tycoon) was one of the reasonable ones. #WHChaos
5743 2018-03-13 14:28:18 Having worked on the GBR agreements, I have a fairly deep understanding of how they came about and their differences from this situation. Forestry is not oil. One can be made sustainable, the other, at its heart, can not.
5744 2018-03-13 14:28:17 So algal biofuels was a hot topic when I was still in undergrad - if I rememebr correctly the oil yield was incredbily low relative to the water and other biomass, making it very expensive to separate out. It looks like they must've moved on from that challenge.
5745 2018-03-13 14:28:14 Is this really news to people? I thought this had been established and recognised years ago. Most Chinese takeaway food has a strong taste of salt, often a lot of oil and sometimes very sweet too.
5746 2018-03-13 14:28:12 WTI oil at $61.22/barrel, -$0.14.
5747 2018-03-13 14:28:08 You guys didn't tip me that a little oil in my rice will stop the spillage and save me from wiping the stove every two minutes 
5748 2018-03-13 14:28:01 This is bound to have an impact on oil prices. Middle East tensions might soar leading to a rise in oil prices. Good for US shale as well as IOCs. #OilandGas #MiddleEast
5749 2018-03-13 14:27:53 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
5750 2018-03-13 14:27:50 How many people died from bombs dropped by America, Britain, France and the other countries who created this war for oil..it wasn't ever about anything else..
5751 2018-03-13 14:27:46 Definitely not ok to arm teachers!! Not okay to put oil in the oceans!! Not okay that you promised to fix water systems and infunstructure and you haven't! Not okay that your not deporting illegals all over California and you see so many more homeless Americans!

5755 2018-03-13 14:27:37 The best DIY hair mask I’ve ever used is made of 2 tbsp coconut oil, 2 tbsp honey, 1 egg, 1 cup of bleach, and a 1/2 cup of mayonnaise.
5756 2018-03-13 14:27:33 Good thing I really care about who eminem slams
5757 2018-03-13 14:27:31 We’re oil and gas consumers, citizens of a nation practicing piracy for fuel since inception. let’s not get too righteous or hypocritical, about conflicts of interest, when his account may be critical to our understanding of how to defeat Trump. Mm?
5758 2018-03-13 14:27:27 Yes babe, steamed and sautéed with some olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, rosemary and some seasoning. So good. Can add Parmesan cheeses and bacon crumbles if you desire.

5765 2018-03-13 14:26:43 Probably, Rex who has a "greedy self serving" investment in Russian oil fields just got a "deserving burn" from Putin.
Rex was an international petroleum PARASITIC "stealing for profit" every country and corrupting governments.
And POLLUTION !

5774 2018-03-13 14:25:53 Kind of mortified at the fact that I don't have any hair oil right now
5775 2018-03-13 14:25:52 I'd say he was an oil company pimp, not a whore.
5776 2018-03-13 14:25:51 Tillerson should never have agreed to serve in the first place. He was smart enough to see that Trump had no principles, no integrity, but I imagine he hoped to further the interests of big oil. Tillerson could not swallow murder, tho.
5777 2018-03-13 14:25:44 nah. evil doesn't die that easy. he sees the oil industtry don single handedly brought back coming back. makes him a little like a wv coal miner hoping for a job.
5778 2018-03-13 14:25:40 Hi Kevin! The sticky residue comes from using too much oil while seasoning. We suggest washing with soap and water, then seasoning again with less oil!
5779 2018-03-13 14:25:40 Tillerson still fights for his big oil bosses, he doesn't care about American families who pay the costs of air and water pollution from toxic oil and coal companies. #fightclimatechange 
5780 2018-03-13 14:25:34 What's the corresponding growth/decline for coal & oil?

5782 2018-03-13 14:25:04 I use Covergirl’s clean liquid concealer- it’s the one w/o oil for sensitive skin I follow with their clean matte pressed powder. You can find either at just about any drug store for like $8 each. Also, make sure your face is moisturized well too :-)
5783 2018-03-13 14:25:03 Don't man. I haven't got any butter and I'm not putting oil in it.
5784 2018-03-13 14:25:01 The baby oil I got at home smells like disaronno man
5785 2018-03-13 14:24:55 Arnold Schwarzenegger plans to sue the big oil companies for "first degree murder." And they plan to counter-sue him for "Jingle All the Way."
5786 2018-03-13 14:24:55 Absolutely. My concern is that those luxury car buyers are so obsessed with the one evil they are getting rid of (oil) that they overlook the fact that they risk replacing it with another (exploitative cobalt extraction). Making that connection may help improve the situation.
5787 2018-03-13 14:24:51 Hi Lani, be sure to apply to a clean bare face that is free of any oils, creams, etc. With a small angled brush, such as our Dual Precision Brush, use light upward strokes & only a little bit of product. You can fix any mistakes with an oil based product and a q-tip. - Fina M.

5789 2018-03-13 14:24:28 #Libya #Libyaoil Not clear how much oil coming from Libya's south west. Zawiya port, serving Sharara field (308,000 b/d) closed by strike, while El Feel (70,000) under force majeure after guards strike starting Feb 24.
5790 2018-03-13 14:24:21 My guess is Rex probably already has his oil deal signed with Putin.
5791 2018-03-13 14:24:12 Haley is a Nationalist and Tillerson is a Globalist.  Like oil and water.
5792 2018-03-13 14:24:04 I was skeptical at first of having an oil man as the Secretary of State, but Tillerson impressed me. Hate to see him go, but I agree with one thing Trump said in that Rex would be happier now.  Much happier not having to deal with a president that cut him off at the knees.
5793 2018-03-13 14:24:02 Fair enough but what would be the case they could put forward to have AB exempt from oil and gas revenues? We aren't  Nfld. kenney can bluster all he wants but he won't win this one. Or the carbon tax and I hate that people believe he can.
5794 2018-03-13 14:23:58 Both sides play the game, today you see it from the left.
Before Today: We hate Tillerson, he is awful, he only cares about oil, he is unqualified.
Today: I can't believe Trump fired Tillerson, what will we do, he was doing so well, Trump is insane.

5797 2018-03-13 14:23:32 @bobmaxon @WeatherJosh I just watched an oil truck slide down my street in Wolcott, and it is not a steep hill. We have about 5” on the Wolcott/Bristol line.
5798 2018-03-13 14:23:19 Rex may be a different case. He was blindsided after just speaking out about Skripal. Big oil exec. Stay tuned...
5799 2018-03-13 14:23:15 辛いに一足すって具体的に何したらいいんだろう。上司に包丁でも刺せばいいのか。
5800 2018-03-13 14:22:59 Pretty close, food snobs would say aoli has olive oil and garlic with egg yolk, mayo has a neutral oil, like canola, and no garlic with egg yolk...we could blame the French cuisine...
5801 2018-03-13 14:22:59 hahahaha! the greedy oil baron is too forthright for the trump administration...
5802 2018-03-13 14:22:32 No... REXXON is very likely going to work on the big oil deal from the outside

5808 2018-03-13 14:21:05 
5809 2018-03-13 14:21:02 my favorite detail about rex tillerson isn't that he wouldn't let state dept employees look him in the eye; it was that even the oil suit who was given russia's "order of friendship" wasn't loyal enough to russia for the president of the united states

5812 2018-03-13 14:20:39 @StateDept How’s it feel to be the second stringer to that unqualified buffoon Rex Tillerson? I bet you’ve been pretty busy licking up all of Trump’s “crude oil”, but if you have a second could you tell me how an invasive, Big Brother loving slimebag like you could help America?

5814 2018-03-13 14:20:32 Tillerson was a businessman who was put in place to run the oil business formed after the sanctions were removed. That didn't work out. Pompeo is a dominionist ideologue who will be happy to spread putin's desire for chaos and warfare around the globe and weakening the US.
5815 2018-03-13 14:20:30 By "rebuild" do you mean continue to shrink and further ruin our National Parks - so that mining, ranching & gas and oil companies can defile and ruin the PEOPLES parks for  money$$&? Hypocrite! You have no intention of rebuilding the parks.
5816 2018-03-13 14:20:18 @RexTillersom Canadian who supports Democrats Rex. You were probably the most honest person there. Run far & run fast. You dont need 2 surround URself with thisburning building. I always thought there was a tie-in btwn Putin-.@POTUS- yourself & Black Sea OIL.
5817 2018-03-13 14:20:13 Oil cleansers/ oil based removers are life and love when it comes to eyelash glue. Especially when it comes to removing the glue from your falsies. I let mine sit in an oil soaked cotton ball over night and the glue peels off v nicely 
5818 2018-03-13 14:20:08 Follow the money:
-Tillerson criticises Putin, ostensibly angering DT
-giving DT cover to fire Rex
-then DT lifts #RussiaSanctions 
-Rex is free to pursue the $500B oil deal he previously brokered w/Putin
-does DT get a cut?!

5829 2018-03-13 14:19:14 while IT and BPO industry continue to boom as projected, new oil rigs open up, mining laws are revamped to better serve the country, jeepney phase out is done in a reasonable manner, new trains run continously on reinforced tracks and oil prices decline steadily. 
5830 2018-03-13 14:19:10 Well at least now Exxon has theirCEO back full-time to oversee the future damage Russian oligarch oil speculation has in store for Trump's new US. He probably has some great new names for the country in mind in the morons we pretend to be polite to swallow it! Hardly exaggerating
5831 2018-03-13 14:19:05 Are you willing to put your house on the line to cover environmental damage from a spill? Are you willing to jail the oil company executives and their PCP of Alberta enablers who let the tailings pond disaster develop?

5837 2018-03-13 14:18:51 @GovMaryFallin This year? Our race to the bottom has occurred over 12-years(aka your two terms). During this time period, Oil and Gas were making windfall year over year profits and all you did was codify their industries’ permanent tax-cuts. #GOPfail
5838 2018-03-13 14:18:50 Now that a former oil executive isn’t in your cabinet, can you possibly do something about the rising gas prices?
5839 2018-03-13 14:18:44 How are you going to rebuild parks by slashing the budget? Answer is you’re not, and have no intention of doing anything besides giving lands to oil and mining interests. Resign now, you criminal

5851 2018-03-13 14:17:48 Tillerson is now free to deal with Russia with oil contracts. This to me is all planned.
5852 2018-03-13 14:17:45 Since #Russia was unable to get the #Sanctions remove for the Exxon/Russia oil deal, #RexTillerson was ultimately removed from the Secretary of State position. A position Russia forced @realDonaldTrump to place him for that sole reason. #Collusion
5853 2018-03-13 14:17:42 Exxon has decided that the cost benefit of extracting oil from their Arctic/Russian lands is still not there: Tillerson leaves office.

5875 2018-03-13 14:15:25 You know how something taken out of context can make a whole new story in your head? 

I just had that.. a very pleasant one about one gorgeous man getting an oil massage from an even more gorgeous man... - now i just want pictures or video.. or a live performance..
5876 2018-03-13 14:15:21 I never liked #RexTillerson's appointment as SoS because of his strong attachment to big oil.  Yet I can't help feeling a little sorry for him for his year long humiliation. #GettingSackedAt30000ft
5877 2018-03-13 14:15:19 Check your Engine oil this morning.
5878 2018-03-13 14:15:15 I'm literally soaked with oil at the moment. 
5879 2018-03-13 14:15:09 Oil and golden showers.
5880 2018-03-13 14:15:08 Tillerson was only there to lift the Russian sanctions.  When the oil/Russia deal was put on the back burner, everyone knew he was done.  That was his only and only job after being picked for the job by the Kremlin.
5881 2018-03-13 14:15:06 Can somebody come take my car to get an oil change while I’m at work? I’ll love you forever and no you don’t have to pay for it 
5882 2018-03-13 14:15:04 if you’re pricing your low-effort book the same as someone who took a year to write a masterful work of literature, what does that say about how you value your time and effort? again: snake oil salesman. “our trash is your gold” #engl3246

5888 2018-03-13 14:14:38 Finding harder to find truer risk to oil market, maybe you can illuminate, as US wasn't an importer from Iran, and EU won't go along w/ blowing up the deal. 

On the nuclear question, much diff story I'd guess. #OOTT

5901 2018-03-13 14:13:18 The weakness in 2016 was due to falling investment in the North Sea

Onshore investment numbers show continued steady growth

Oil & gas is the sector that you would least expect there to be effected by Brexit - low tariff & NTBs

The bust was due to a collapse in the oil price

5903 2018-03-13 14:13:14 Sort of....the thinking was Rex would be onboard with the Putin bromance because of the oil industry background but--Putin actually killing citizens in one of our staunchest allie's countries was a bridge too far for old Rex. ( Not for Donald though)
5904 2018-03-13 14:13:11 Would have thought Pooty would LOVE Tillerson. Rex was awarded "Best Friend of Russia" or some such. Although he didn't get Pooty those oil drilling permits worth $500B.

5909 2018-03-13 14:12:57 People said tillerson was owned by oil, and we would be in Middle East within the first year.....I just say, let’s see what happens, in all reality, it’s all we can do
5910 2018-03-13 14:12:55 But but but you dem wits said tillerson was a Russian friend and would always side with Putin, you know because he was & oil man and had met with Putin. Ah y’all twist & turn, you can’t have it both ways.
5911 2018-03-13 14:12:52 @Schwarzenegger I've contacted Karen Kukurin via Linked in about GreenNH3 a new patented machine that makes zero carbon fuel at 30 cents a little. A Canadian scientist is teaming up with a Canadian university to build them. This could help in your fight with oil- PLEASE reply Thx
5912 2018-03-13 14:12:51 Wasn't Tillerson talking about leaving in January? State department has been sufficiently gutted, and Venezuelan oil is Russia's. Tillerson job is done.

5915 2018-03-13 14:12:31 Indian Rupee ended stronger today. The Rupee rose against the US Dollar as sales of the greenback by foreign banks triggered stop-losses. However, Dollar purchases for oil importers capped further appreciation in the Rupee. Rupee ended at 64.89 vs. yesterday’s close of 65.04.
5916 2018-03-13 14:12:28 I have an oil change scheduled at 10:30 but do you think I’m otw yet ?
5917 2018-03-13 14:12:23 Access to undeveloped Russian oil and gas shale plays closed off by sanctions are what's motivating Putin and his fellow oligarchs.  Putin likely offered Trump lucrative real estate developments in return for removing sanctions.

They all stood to make many billions.

5920 2018-03-13 14:12:08 Liberals in 2016: Rex Tillerson is evil, big oil corruption.

Liberals today: OMG, we love Rex. Can't wait for him to turn on Trump and prove collusion.

5924 2018-03-13 14:11:43 Follow the money:
-Tillerson criticises Putin, ostensibly angering DT
-giving DT cover to fire Rex
-then DT lifts #RussiaSanctions 
-Rex is free to pursue the $500B oil deal he previously brokered w/Putin
-DT gets a cut?!
VOILA!

5928 2018-03-13 14:10:55 Tillerson did say that there was no point in taking actions against Russia's cyber attack since they would just find other ways. Also he spent 0 of $120M to combat the attacks. Not exactly anti-Russia, I think he still wanted an oil deal with them.
5929 2018-03-13 14:10:47 Trump getting rid of the oil guys might mean I have to get rid of trump

5937 2018-03-13 14:10:03 In the latest Russiagate twist, the oil man who was installed by Russia to be Secretary of State cuz he's best friends with Putin is actually the principled #resistance hero fired for his tough words against...Putin.

Imagine holding all of these beliefs in your head at once.

5944 2018-03-13 14:09:34 Tillerson failed to get sanctions lifted ..so Putin wanted him fired and back in the oil business with him ....when Pompeo gets the sanctions lifted ...
5945 2018-03-13 14:09:25 Trump’s ‘well-oiled machine’ isn’t so much a lubrication of moving parts but just dumping oil and gas all over it and tossing in a match
5946 2018-03-13 14:09:09 I bet trump left him on an oil rig with no ride back
5947 2018-03-13 14:09:08 It is remarkable but not surprising to me that the talking heads are immediately making over Rex Tillerson as "principled" and "traditional." He was and is neither. He was an oil salesman for a company that is destroying the planet and very close to Putin.
5948 2018-03-13 14:09:02 Not only that, a bottle of baby oil to boot!!
5949 2018-03-13 14:09:00 Oh no! Nic got lost in the snow and wind along the Bering Sea.  Am glad he is back on track and the team is safe.

5951 2018-03-13 14:08:51 The decision by #Trump to replace #Tillerson with known #Iran hawk, #Pompeo , is a reliable sign that the #US will move to terminate the JCPOA deal, further stoking the flames of war in the Middle East.

5953 2018-03-13 14:08:47 I enjoy watching #MAGA minions now use "Democratic" talking points used agasinst Rex Tillerson before his confirmation now that @realDonaldTrump fired him (via tweet) i.e. no knowledge of foreign policy, oil man not diplomat, etc. Inexperience only matters when it fits narrative
5954 2018-03-13 14:08:43 Tillerson gave up a lucrative job in the oil industry to be the chief US diplomat. He signed an agreement which bars him from returning for 10 years.

It's poetic justice: Bend your knee to the worst leader in US history, get stabbed in the back--exactly what you deserve.

#Rexit
5955 2018-03-13 14:08:39 Putin's puppet dumps Rexxon for agreeing w/UK; also as the oil arc & nuclear arc in the ME looks less likely who needs an oil exec when a lapdog who will continue gutting State will do? AND a torturer takes over the CIA: bonus!
5956 2018-03-13 14:08:32 I know @politicalham would probably have some specifics about oil company efforts to reduce emissions.
5957 2018-03-13 14:08:31 The air-quality problem is so horrific that even though I can travel to other countries wo problem here I feel like I’m drinking my oil pan just by breathing & diesel exhaust is akin to being pelted in the face with small sand but it’s filth, slimy coating & it feels warm.
5958 2018-03-13 14:08:18 But the fact that all gas and oil companies have a “Department of Planning The Demise Of Cute Animals And Forests All Over The World” is true, right?
5959 2018-03-13 14:08:16 He only wanted Russian connections for his oil business I think who knows
5960 2018-03-13 14:08:13 That's gasoline  not oil.
5961 2018-03-13 14:07:59 Oil?? 
5962 2018-03-13 14:07:55 And for the record I know that oil companies themselves are furiously working to eliminate emissions from the production aiming for net-zero facilities. (Still leaves the the transportation sector emissions of course but EVs are helping make a big dent there).

5998 2018-03-13 14:05:57 I go along with that too. Add that if anyone really knew how Putin plays, it was Tillerson simply from his years of having to deal with Putin one on one because if oil.
5999 2018-03-13 14:05:48 Let’s assume you’re serious for a sec. if there’s hint that oil or Forex or other instruments moved prior to announcement (use that term advisedly) then someone’s made a killing. Remember the stories about people selling off steel stock prior to tariff announcement?

6004 2018-03-13 14:05:16 Tillerson has gone the way of the Tyrannosaur. But he's going out as he would've wanted: having his bones processed into oil.
6005 2018-03-13 14:05:16 because u don't know the oil industry or Exxon or how Rex treats his employees or the merit system he installed there to cut through corporate politics and level the playing field for all, from entry level on up. Rex is a good person. Trump is a traitor.
6006 2018-03-13 14:05:12 I'm not defending Trump, but imo Tillerson gets WAAAAAAY too much credit for doing...what exactly while running XOM? Buying XTO? Canadian oil sands investments? Russia?
6007 2018-03-13 14:04:24 Now Rex Tillerson can retire to his oil rig in peace
6008 2018-03-13 14:04:18 hot oil
6009 2018-03-13 14:04:16 To be fair, for the last 100 years, foreign policy and oil have been indistinguishable from each other
6010 2018-03-13 14:04:12 Thing is, most individuals in a mature society understand why taxes, laws, and similar need paying to oil those gears. Libertarians do not. And when idiots like JRM stash all their money so they don’t pay their share libertarians have good reason to be pissed.
6011 2018-03-13 14:04:08 ....He anoints my head with oil
6012 2018-03-13 14:03:55 What the betting that after the election the significant oil and gas fine will cease to be significant.
6013 2018-03-13 14:03:52 @ShopYourWay @searscares I did my first oil change at @Sears  and had my lawn mower serviced, but I don't think the transactions were included in my shop your way rewards. Can they be added?

6020 2018-03-13 14:03:18 @Simple_Trends thoughts on jumping back into DWT? Oil price hit peak?

6026 2018-03-13 14:02:57 Now that comment you'll have to back up. Are you seriously trying to say oil companies spent no money on R&D, and neither did they implement new, cleaner technologies? Have you ever read a balance sheet or investor presentation? Smacks of ignorance.
6027 2018-03-13 14:02:48 I also mix olive, avacado, and castor oil to use in my hair. What ever methods you choose, stick with them! It may take time to train your hair and start seeing the results you really want depending on how much heat damage you have.

6038 2018-03-13 14:01:54 Isn’t that what close allies are suppose to do? Tillerson knows all the players in the oil business, does Pompeo?

6044 2018-03-13 14:01:35 I stopped reading after you asserted that drilling for oil is a good thing. It has negative consequence for national security has it depletes are reserves, eliminates our subsides that encourage conversation, and overall destroys our land. You can continue shilling for Trump.
6045 2018-03-13 14:01:34 Rex Tillerson was hand picked by Putin. No experience, an oil grifter and pals with Russia.He had never met trump before being appointed to Sec. of State. Good riddance to one more unqualified grifter in the trump administration.  #ImpeachTrump #Resist #imposeRussianSanctions
6046 2018-03-13 14:01:34 WW3 coming soon.   Tariffs are to build our own war machines.  Pompeo is the biggest piece of  to walk the planet.  TAPI pipeline will be built at all costs.   Even if there’s no people left on earth to use the oil.
6047 2018-03-13 14:01:31 Trump didn't even know who Rex was. He was told to put him in as Sec of State based on his big oil and Russian relationships. At the end of the day though, if you criticize Putin, you're done.
6048 2018-03-13 14:01:27 Don't worry, Bush Oil mafia Tillerson ain't good enough! The Benghazi witch hunter Pompeo will do better for Putin!!
6049 2018-03-13 14:01:25 Nigeria with so much Oil still imports nearly all of its petrol. Likewise its mind bugling So'ton waited this long to get rid of Pellegrino.

6051 2018-03-13 14:01:10 Though sceptical because of his big money and big oil baggage, Tillerson was one of the few willing and able to suffer the abuses of power manchild Trump heaped on dissenters. One of the few remaining adults has just excited the circus tent.

6055 2018-03-13 14:00:50 OIL DIFF: 3.76 -> 3.76
6056 2018-03-13 14:00:47 The Trump presidency is a disaster. If the firing of Rex Tillerson doesn't open your eyes, nothing will. Was originally skeptical of Rex bc he came from big oil. But he seemed to be doing well in the role and pushed back on Trump. Guess he pushed one time to many.
6057 2018-03-13 14:00:41 OIL momentum higher slowing after WHALES go against chart trends, UWT trailing stop exit 2.41 +3.8 gain.
6058 2018-03-13 14:00:40 So that was the straw that broke trump’s back. Tillerson knows that his deal, putting Exxon in charge of Putin’s oil expansion, wasn’t going to happen so there was no reason for him to be loyal to him. But trump, on the other hand, is deeply indebted to Putin.
6059 2018-03-13 14:00:35 Tillerson doesn't care ,the oil and gas industry just needed him there to make sure they were deregulated and then travel on tax payers dime to seal deals around the world ,Mueller needs to haul Tillerson in because Russians are his friends too in business!!

6065 2018-03-13 14:00:15 Not affirmative action pal. Just a non sexist hire although all you clowns say he’s misogynistic. As far as Rex, liberals hate big oil so while he may have been distinguished in his field, he worked for the Evil oil Empire.
6066 2018-03-13 14:00:08 Big Navy. Big Oil. Big Tobacco. Big Enos. You can’t trust any of them.
6067 2018-03-13 14:00:03 As soon as the sanctions against Russia were not lifted Tillerson lost his value as SoS because the major oil fields in Russia could not be accessed.

Tillerson did his best to destroy the State Dept to make himself useful but unwisely said something true before he finished.

6078 2018-03-13 13:59:28 Thought well of Tillerson but now confused about whether he was Putin's personal oil barron or Russia's archenemy. Hard to keep up.
6079 2018-03-13 13:59:27 Heavens! People around the world are rallying to protect themselves from Canada's continued degradation of the global environment. How awful of them to fight for a healthy environment, rather than pander to Canada's oil and gas industries.

6134 2018-03-13 13:55:20 Looks like the idiots areally taking Rexit as bullish for oil since they think that the Iran deal dies without him. Iran announced that they will be pumping more either way. This has zero to do with supply.

6167 2018-03-13 13:52:38 I can see this def. impacting US refining and incetivizing exports of light oil - but I'd expect it to have marginal/modest impact globally. Even at the tremendous growth rates we've seen, LTO may not shift the global slate upwards by more than 1-2 degree API over 20 years.

6202 2018-03-13 13:50:18 Forgot to put coconut oil on my ass last night.

Why?

Idk why i forgot.
I just know it was important.
6203 2018-03-13 13:50:03 I’d say both he and Trump just want him to be back in big oil where he can make squillions for both of them and Putin all at the same time.

6240 2018-03-13 13:46:52 So Rex is just going to go back to his job of selling oil right?
6241 2018-03-13 13:46:49 If you read his wiki page, he's a Koch brothers stooge and a oil and gas speculator and a war hawk. The last person you want running your diplomacy.
6242 2018-03-13 13:46:44 Well he replaced a corrupt oil baron with a warmonger. Oh and the CIA is now being led by a war criminal. 

So, that's a thing.

6257 2018-03-13 13:45:34 45 has to obey his puppet master that wanted Rex out. Rex can forget that oil money now.
6258 2018-03-13 13:45:33 Where has the 300BN oil money gone then?
It wasn't spent in Scotland that's for sure so what was it spent on?

6268 2018-03-13 13:44:37 trump has fired his secretary of state, an oil executive whose head looked like a mad fold-in named fido robertson
6269 2018-03-13 13:44:37 AM I THE ONLY PERSON WONDERING IF REX TILLERSON LEFT HIS POST AS SEC STATE TO RETURN TO EXXON UPON LEARNING ARNOLD 'I'LL BE BACK' SCHWARZNEGGAR IS PLANNING TO SUE THE OIL COMPANIES? FUNNY...HE NEVER SUED OPEC.

6278 2018-03-13 13:43:52 Here is my prediction: Trump will put in a Russian sympathizer or someone who has ties to Oil or Russian oligarchs as Secretary of State. Be wary.
6279 2018-03-13 13:43:48 I'm sorry u feel that way...I disagree...dumb as a stump...Exxon Mobil lol...yeah..he was gonna explore oil in Alaska...with Russia...jeeze...drink your coffee...walk up a bit...cheers.
6280 2018-03-13 13:43:48 Yes thats cos scots oil has propped up the UK for 40 years

6287 2018-03-13 13:43:25 Tel Aviv will push US as far as it can get away with, counting on their friends in AIPAC and elsewhere to smooth the way, aided by a docile or complicit MSM in the States. Tillerson was in Lebanon a week or two ago trying to get Lebanese to cede some maritime oil block to Israel.
6288 2018-03-13 13:43:24 This just shows why it wasn't working. They don't think alike & Tillerson wasn't going to follow Trump's lead, he was going to do what he thought best. They couldn't even get on the same page abt the circumstances of the firing. Quiet Tillerson & bombastic Trump like oil & water.
6289 2018-03-13 13:43:14 Front and back contracts are trading in sync today..if the back contract inches ahead...backwardation would be gone.

6294 2018-03-13 13:42:52 Rex Tillerson, brokered a deal with Russia in 2013 for 60 million acres of Russian land to pump oil out of, but all that Russian oil went through pipelines in the Ukraine, who heavily taxed the proceeds, and were applying for admission into NATO at the time.

6297 2018-03-13 13:42:23 The sheep don’t know what to do w/ themselves.  They rightly detest Tillerson for being a big oil shitweasel, but are somehow OUTRAGED he lost his job.
6298 2018-03-13 13:42:22 Sorry to hear Tillison leaving. Had liked him! God bless him in what ever. 
I believe he's a big oil man so am sure has enough to keep him busy
6299 2018-03-13 13:42:21 David L. Goldwyn: ”Most of the oil companies are worried about what comes next. Especially if there is an oil embargo and they have to suspend operations”. #ACEnergy #ACVenezuela
6300 2018-03-13 13:42:16 The oil baron who was awarded the Russian Order of Friendship was just fired as Sec. of State for not being nice enough to Russia. Let that sink in to your borscht. But sure...no collusion.

6312 2018-03-13 13:41:28 Turkey profited from the war against ISIS by surreptiously buying ISIS oil at low prices. Erdogan’s son ran that sleazy operation, thus enriching the Erdogan family. Those people are ‘friends’ of the West?

6319 2018-03-13 13:41:03 I'm not saying Rex Tillerson is anything other than the Earth-raping oil executive he is. That said, the dude has to feel like he just got off Death Row, and I'm kind of happy for him. Use your bucks, move to the Maldives and think about your life, Rexy.

6323 2018-03-13 13:40:56 It was only a matter of time. Rex and our future Dictator have always been at odds.  Rex, although he worked well with russia on oil deals and profits for Exxon, seems unable to sell out American like his boss!!
6324 2018-03-13 13:40:49 Put the Kool aid down. All I did was post a screen shot that suggested shipping oil by tanker is not “PERFECTLY HARMLESS everywhere else in the world. #bcpoli “. It’s bullshit Max, and you know it.
6325 2018-03-13 13:40:40 I guess @RexTillersonWH is useless to him now as far as oil drilling in the Baltics.
6326 2018-03-13 13:40:36 I believe that Putin has NOT gotten the oil deals he wants, but there’s no doubt Tillerson was fired for crossing Russia. Add that to #Impeachment2018

6328 2018-03-13 13:40:26 What astonishes me is that a year ago, I was terrified of a literal oil executive steering the country's foreign policy, perhaps more so than of any other cabinet appointment. Now I'm terrified he's leaving, because the replacement is a deranged crusader itching to bomb Iran.

6341 2018-03-13 13:39:24 Yeah, I thought Rex was too invested in the oil side of things, although, in the recess of my brain, I remember reading that he divested himself of all  oil related stock.  I raised my eyebrows at his statement re the Russian poisening last night, so perhaps he will surprise us.
6342 2018-03-13 13:39:23 Daniel Greenfield, at FrontPageMag today, outlines the myth of Putin’s affinity for Trump and proves he was waiting years for HRC to be elected. DG left one thing out: Trump campaigned on energy policies that would rob Putin of hard currency (natgas/oil receipts.)
6343 2018-03-13 13:39:21 If Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of a major oil company, can't survive in Trump's cabinet, clearly nobody is safe.

6347 2018-03-13 13:39:02 Tillerson got fired, not that I'm objecting because fuck that oil man, I'm suprised more than anything. That said, saying "he'll be much happier" is what rotten children say before locking Dad in an old folks home and taking all his cash.

6355 2018-03-13 13:38:27 White smoke typically indicates that a small portion of oil is leaking through the seal to the combustion chamber.  Castrol recommends that you consult an auto mechanic.
6356 2018-03-13 13:38:26 Alberta definitely needs to diversify it's increasingly obsolete economy but leaving oil in the ground isn't an option when you have absolutely no follow up options in place.

6361 2018-03-13 13:38:17 That’s like asking the oil industry to weigh in on the environmental impact of petroleum. It’s going to be biased.
6362 2018-03-13 13:38:15 As an oil painter I’m learning this the hard way
6363 2018-03-13 13:38:13 alright so i thought id make a skin care routine cus my face is a BITCH to buy a bottle of this emu oil.
6364 2018-03-13 13:38:11 well duh, if I was an oil baron i'd want to stay in a top government position so I could further my fortune.
6365 2018-03-13 13:38:01 Ok. So maybe Tillerson, even though he is an oil guy who loves Putin, wasn't a man of no character who would let him get away with murder
6366 2018-03-13 13:37:59 Looks like the Trump well oiled machine has just run out of oil.
6367 2018-03-13 13:37:58 Oil remains micro data obsessed.  Whatever is shown on the wkly, is extrapolated into the yrly.  Macro factors are being completely ignored, with wkly data supporting either the build/draw thesis.  Bias, in spooky broader mkts, is downside.
6368 2018-03-13 13:37:43 Looks like the backwardation between j and k is gone, is that what the graph shows?
6369 2018-03-13 13:37:37 Well. I guess Tillerson hit every oil producing country in the world. Now it's his time to cash in on his side deals. Took about a year. Good work if you can get it. But remember 1 thing. The king of fracking sued to stop fracking near his property. So he speaks with 2 mouths.
6370 2018-03-13 13:37:36 Looks like he does his own tattoos.

6378 2018-03-13 13:36:29 If all the geniuses in DC agree that America should produce its on steel, oil and coal for National Security purposes.

6379 2018-03-13 13:36:26 お大事に..
6380 2018-03-13 13:36:19 Venezuela’s oil production has been on a downward trend for two decades, but it has experienced significant decreases over the past two years. Oil production in Venezuela decreased from 2.3 mmb/d in January 2016 to 1.6 mmb/d in January 2018.
6381 2018-03-13 13:36:18 honestly, the fact that the Secretary of State job is being transferred from a Big Oil CEO to a CIA director says about as much as you need to know about American foreign policy
6382 2018-03-13 13:35:49 I just spilled oil all over in here.

6385 2018-03-13 13:35:40 Green energy is, to China, what Oil was to the US and, before that, what Coal was to the UK.

6389 2018-03-13 13:35:31 The 2/3rds GDP figure is bogus, Wall Street only creates bogus financial instruments. The red part of the country actually produces real goods like food, oil, and cars.
6390 2018-03-13 13:35:27 The timing is bad, very bad, but remember that Tillerson had a back channel going with Russia and UAI for his oil dealings, Putin wanted Tillerson in to put a huge oil deal through to shore up Russian economy, and he is another Russian tool. They all are.
6391 2018-03-13 13:35:19 Tillerson's 9 trillion dollar oil deal with Russia couldn't happen because Trump couldn't lift the Russian sanctions....so Tillerson doesn't need to be part of the administration anymore.

This isn't normal, people.....

6400 2018-03-13 13:34:33 I’m every democrat shunning the shitcanning of an oil magnate to run American foreign policy
6401 2018-03-13 13:34:30 Come oil it for me .
6402 2018-03-13 13:34:29 Lmao. Good intentions with bad judgement. I gave him some oil change instruction after the mishap. When trying to impress the girl goes horribly wrong. He’s a great kid though.
6403 2018-03-13 13:34:29 お疲れ様でした
6404 2018-03-13 13:34:27 I keep playing about getting a oil change it say -286
6405 2018-03-13 13:34:21 Don't feel too bad for Rex Tillerson; he was only in this to get sanctions lifted against Russia so Exxon could sell them the tech they need to profitably extract oil. Mission accomplished.
6406 2018-03-13 13:34:14 If I were Trump I wouldn't want Tillerson and all that oil money irritated with me. Glad I'm not Trump.
6407 2018-03-13 13:34:04 Not to mention the billions China has already invested in the oil sands. Ultra low prices are killing the competitiveness of shale oil on the international market and the 'British' Colombian government knows that.
6408 2018-03-13 13:34:01 I remember my student days in the early 1980s when olive oil could only be found in the pharmacy section of the supermarket...or was it just Essex?
6409 2018-03-13 13:33:59 So Tillerson gave up his oil companies to work for @realDonaldTrump and now he drops him
6410 2018-03-13 13:33:53 Oil change time. Taking care of Bae early morning.
6411 2018-03-13 13:33:50 Remember Rex has his own bromance with Russian oil reserves.
6412 2018-03-13 13:33:50 Have an amazing non-stick pan, doesn't need any extra oil.
6413 2018-03-13 13:33:46 เรือนู้นเขาแรงจนเรือออยจะตามไม่ทันแล้ว
6414 2018-03-13 13:33:42 Tillerson is resigning as SoS because his 9 trillion dollar oil deal with Russia isn't happening because of the Russian sanctions Trump was supposed to take away for his buddy Putin.....

But sure, keep bringing up Clinton and Obama and pretend everything right now is ok.

Adios
6415 2018-03-13 13:33:36 Hey, @MorningEdition, #Tillerson's departure wasn't unexpected to those of us who heard that Exxon has called off its multi-trillion-dollar oil deal in Russia. If you're gonna "cover this from all angles," don't forget that one.
6416 2018-03-13 13:33:33 ลงเลยคะ เป็นอีกที่ที่อยากไป
6417 2018-03-13 13:33:29 Don't be fooled by @realDonaldTrump firing Rex. Follow the money:
-Tillerson criticises Putin, ostensibly angering DT
-giving DT cover to fire Rex
-then DT lifts #RussiaSanctions 
-Rex is free to pursue the $500B oil deal he previously brokered w/Putin
-DT gets a cut?!
VOILA!
6418 2018-03-13 13:33:28 The former head of the CIA is being made Secretary of State because he is more pro Russia than Tillerson, who received the highest honor a non-Russian could get from the Kremlin and who was in a half trillion dollar oil deal with them.

The GOP is killing American democracy.

6420 2018-03-13 13:33:15 I re twisted my hair with shea butter and oil for the first time. And I think I might do it from now on ..
6421 2018-03-13 13:33:07 That's bs. Iraq and Libya had enough gold to start a world Bank. Not counting frozen bank accounts and priceless artefacts also looted. And finally oil x 1 million barrels x 100+ oil wells x 365 days x 20+ years. And not counting weapons deals. So much as msm lied they PROFITED.
6422 2018-03-13 13:33:01 I haven't had my "oil changed" in a long time.
6423 2018-03-13 13:32:53 Geez and Washington allows oil in their ports
6424 2018-03-13 13:32:39 Oh tu maybe ada mineral oil , cari ingredient yang takda mineral oil , biasanya mahal sikit
6425 2018-03-13 13:32:30 Farmers and oil workers are just sooooooooooooo 20th Century!
6426 2018-03-13 13:32:30 #msnbc @JohnKasich traditional vs what cray cray? It's the difference between success and failure and flop. #Trump is a one man band welfare Republican con not a successful businessman. Rex Tillerson for all his oil finger flaws is a smart cookie not a crumb.

6442 2018-03-13 13:31:57 @HallieJackson Remember the scene in "Waterworld"? The guy floating in the oil in the hold of  the "Exxon-Valdez" when the grenade was thrown in & said "Oh, thank God..."
6443 2018-03-13 13:31:53 At the BMW dealership waiting on the oil change...I hope this isn't long
6444 2018-03-13 13:31:51 It's no coincidence Cohn & Tillerson are both leaving now. There is now a new global oil/dollar market architecture in place. The only question to be established - once the Shanghai Exchange opens on March 26th  - is whether China is part of it or not #OOTT

6447 2018-03-13 13:31:37 No amount of media coverage on either side that will change my opinion that I think this man is a snake oil salesman dead set on destroying the Republican Party. He is tasteless, narcistic and gross in every way. Do YOUR research. 3/3

6449 2018-03-13 13:31:30 Are you feeling better yet? Worried about ya, mate. This is crazy about Haspel. Can we find out if she is also invested in the for profit prison industry? Or big Oil, or???  Who are her corporate handlers?
6450 2018-03-13 13:31:25 Further to possible being wrong :D - could you expand on this? "The oil industry and government of Alberta has shown it is willing to work to reduce emissions." What are the concrete examples beyond promises for the future?
6451 2018-03-13 13:31:13 I found a pic of myself as a kid and was simultaneously happy and depressed. It’s like “hahaha such simple times. Just playing and research projects on manatees!” but then it’s like, “ugh. Such simple times. Fuck I need to get my oil changed and pay the water bill”.
6452 2018-03-13 13:31:10 As most others have stated, gas prices are the bigger price fixing scam. Prices don't reflect oil prices and it has a larger impact on more people than a couple of cents on bread. Why does the media not care about that? A much bigger issue than the cheap price of bread.
6453 2018-03-13 13:31:05 IF REXXON DOESNT TELL ALL HES WORKING ON THE BIG OIL DEAL FROM THE OUTSIDE
6454 2018-03-13 13:31:05 Well, not today...
6455 2018-03-13 13:31:01 Nothing says adulting like buying a new tire because there’s a nail in it. and getting your first oil change by yourself.

6461 2018-03-13 13:30:39 It depends on how you make them. E.g. if you fry them in oil, they are very crispy. Those were more 'boiled/cooked', so not really crispy. The taste is unique in my opinion, but not very strong, more neutral. They have a texture similar to mealy potato I guess? Hard to describe:)
6462 2018-03-13 13:30:24 Before, from oil & gas to Secretary of State.
Today, from CIA to Secretary of State.

6470 2018-03-13 13:29:57 Jason Exon and Tillerson were in place for one reason. Russian oil pipeline. When that fell through last week it was a countdown for Tillerson to exit. Come on now.
6471 2018-03-13 13:29:46 #CarterPage - If at first you don’t succeed with that $8 billion oil deal with the #Russians, make #RexTillerson #SecretaryofState...

If at second you don’t succeed... Your #TransparentObfuscation is embarrassing, and a joke...

Hail to the #AssClowninChief
6472 2018-03-13 13:29:45 I agree with you, all this is too complicated for no good reason. Two compounds per weekend should be enough. Also, I'd like to see tyre war again, just like with oil and fuel, teams should be able to select a tyre manufacturer they want - or at least be given a choice between 2.

6475 2018-03-13 13:29:30 It's pretty coincidental that this happens after his trip to to Chad. Where Exxon will be drilling new oil.

6481 2018-03-13 13:28:29 US stock futures are up 0.35% with both Asia and Europe mixed. Gold is $1,327 with oil at $61.11. Feels favorable.
6482 2018-03-13 13:28:19 I think so. I think he burned his dingus with hot oil at least
6483 2018-03-13 13:28:14 Just bought some peppermint oil to clear my blocked nose and it is GOOD but also i may have used too much *eyes water*
6484 2018-03-13 13:28:08 The real question I have regarding #RexTillerson is this: How much money will be make in the private sector now after he worked as Secretary of State for the last 13 months, meeting with heads of state and top officials all over the world? Is he now Oil and Gas Magnate in Chief?
6485 2018-03-13 13:28:06 Remember when everyone hated tillerson cuz he was an Big oil shill... KJU helped get the cia out of NK strings have been cut now it’s time to do the same to Iran... that’s another one of Clinton’s guys...
6486 2018-03-13 13:27:46 And consummated a major Arctic oil deal for Garks on both sides of the World. Ex Exxon Rex.
6487 2018-03-13 13:27:43 on the bright side, oil executives have a strong track record of having people killed
6488 2018-03-13 13:27:40 Oil forecasts were HIGHER by your revered tory Gov. Add the rapeclause filth promising a £200b oil boom, more powers, no stripping of powers. You have the balls to call Scots liars :/
6489 2018-03-13 13:27:28 Common @AP do some digging.

#Rex Tillerson failed to get the sanctions lifted for a Trillion dollar oil deal with Russia.

The Trump presidency is rich people trying to change policies to benefit rich people.

6499 2018-03-13 13:26:35 Daughter’s BF decided to check the oil in her car immediately after she drove to his house. It was “low” so he added oil to her 02 Camry. I found oil spewing on my driveway.  Any guesses on how much oil I had to drain from his overfill?......

6518 2018-03-13 13:25:30 Rex Tillerson will be sorely missed at that military parade, given all the warring done for oil and all that.
6519 2018-03-13 13:25:28 Another person out of the administration of #POTUS45 - think of it as a reverse litmus test. #Tillerson must be a decent guy. I mean, for an oil industry billionaire...

6521 2018-03-13 13:25:10 Rex Tillerson's been fired. 
Huh.
As much as I didn't like him bc of his oil company background, I feel as though he was the lone voice of reason among the madness of the Trump cabinet.

6531 2018-03-13 13:24:10 I’m sure he was blind-sided... with all that oil money on his mind. #TrumpRussia #Rosneft #RexxonKnew #WayneTracker
6532 2018-03-13 13:24:07 Tillerson came to the White House to do a massive arctic oil deal with Russia.  That deal went to China last week.  Tillerson began to realize just how nefarious Putin is and started talking.  It was either his public exit interview or hastened his departure.
6533 2018-03-13 13:23:57 Hopefully, the acceptance of electric cars will stop the excessive demand for oil.
6534 2018-03-13 13:23:55 That's a f**k tonne of oil. They're going to do everything in their power to prevent Scottish Independence.
6535 2018-03-13 13:23:41 Wait. I thought they hated Tillerson because he was a big biz, oil company, one percenter? Shouldn't they all be singing Trump's praises now?
6536 2018-03-13 13:23:40 i hate our hell-future where the firing of an unqualified oil executive from the post of US secretary of state deeply worries me
6537 2018-03-13 13:23:39 Mrs. Berry; “ big business”did not override the firs amendment 
The Supreme Court heard the arguments & ruled in favor of the oil company who properly obtained the needed permits for their operations, the end.
6538 2018-03-13 13:23:37 "...price-responsive U.S. tight oil supply may not be the only mechanism keeping crude prices range-bound. An apparent strengthening of country-level linkages between petroleum consumption and crude prices suggests a demand-side buffer against price volatility, too."
6539 2018-03-13 13:23:36 Gotta slather 'em up real nice. Gotta brush oil that meat before you roast it. Toss some slat and pepper on there for good measure. 

What I'm saying is that they're cannibals.
6540 2018-03-13 13:23:36 Tillerson must have failed to find oil on the Korean peninsula.
6541 2018-03-13 13:23:25 Het is zo'n dag.. ->  Special meal request for a guest. He eats only WHOLE FOOD PLANT BASED. It means no animal products, no oil, no salt, no sugar or other sweeteners, no bread, no gluten. So basically vegetables, legumes, fruit, herbs, spices, nuts and seeds. #manmanman
6542 2018-03-13 13:23:23 Not if your Assad or Putin ! Putin is after Middle East oil and will arm other regimes to destroy themselves while he laughs ! He has no regard for Muslims he just wants the oil ! But the regimes are blinded by weapons an greed and Putin knows it ! Russia thinks ME is dumb !

6544 2018-03-13 13:23:07 I appreciate the honesty. I'm focusing on the ones who are being TV evangelists by pretending to be something they're not, and I'm experienced enough to see the damage this causes. It hurts far more people than it helps. These are mass marketers selling snake oil.

6548 2018-03-13 13:22:32 I, for one, appreciate Rex standing with Theresa May on this russian thing...regardless of Tillersons connections with oil and russia (I always thought this was sort of sleazy) but Mr Tillerson did the right thing...now we'll let Mueller do the right thing...
6549 2018-03-13 13:22:24 Norway is probably the best tho tbh, that oil money solves all your problems and no mass uncontrolled immigration there, iceland too

6552 2018-03-13 13:22:02 But Claude, Tillerson was supposed to make a deal with Putin about drilling for oil in the Arctic. Oh well

6554 2018-03-13 13:21:54 With Tillerson gone I’m worried about who in the Trump White House is going to be advocating on behalf of the mom-and-pop multi-billion dollar oil companies.
6555 2018-03-13 13:21:50 Isn't the Russia oil deal dead? That's what Tillerson was added to begin with but now that it's dead it only makes sense Putin no longer has any use for him.
6556 2018-03-13 13:21:42 After a career of destroying the environment and decimating a government agency he didn't understand, the only thing Tillerson accomplished was not kowtowing to Russia as much as the right wing expected out of an oil guy
6557 2018-03-13 13:21:24 Tillerson can go back and spend his oil $$.
6558 2018-03-13 13:21:19 @cenkuygur predicted this Rex Tillerson departure right in time. I'm predicting no one else will report on the possible role the oil deal played in this.
6559 2018-03-13 13:21:16 Only Castrol EDGE 5W-50 has a boosted level of ZDDP (1250 ppm) to help protect flat tappet cam engines in classic cars. Castrol always recommends following the guidelines of the engine manufacturer for the recommended oil .
6560 2018-03-13 13:21:16 I am doing an intensive study of the Word of God. In Exodus 30:31-33 addresses the holy anointing oil, its composition and several requirements or conditions of its makeup and use. Look it up and think about this special anointing and how it applies today.

6564 2018-03-13 13:20:47 thought the left hated Tillerson bc of oil ties to Russia. 

today......

so sad. dumbasses.
6565 2018-03-13 13:20:39 so Iran deal on chopping block, what's this mean for oil?
6566 2018-03-13 13:20:31 He'd been working for years to extract some coveted Russian oil reserves. Perhaps he was trying to complete a project he'd started long ago?
6567 2018-03-13 13:20:30 @AJNewsGrid Loss of Tillerson is a big blow to White House.   He KNOWS the middle East oil producing countries with a LONG relationship with them.  Course his wife is glad to have him back as she was opposed to his taking that job.

Rex can't covertly swing a deal for Exxon drilling for oil in Russia with kickbacks for King Don, so out he goes.
Trump needed to get Stormy Daniels off the front page.

6581 2018-03-13 13:18:41 #MATD I envisage a scenario where during the drill our share price is likely to be suspended pending a major discovery. During that point we could perhaps even get a JV offer on even a full on takeover bid. The realms of possibility is endless with a 4 drill campaign. #OIL

6584 2018-03-13 13:18:20 what’s yr take on @RealMikePompeo & #GinaHaspel? loyal to united states or to 45/putin/oil? just being appointed by @realDonaldTrump makes them suspect at best; traitors suitable for hanging at worst.
6585 2018-03-13 13:18:18 I'm sure Putin has a dumptruck full of dirt on Trump.  Tillerson will go back to being a CEO of an oil company and make $100M a year.  Poor guy!
6586 2018-03-13 13:18:08 @IamNgour Yes that is True because I believe they brings in Wrong people (Lobby Group) and also threat People with power to loot they country Specially in Oil Companies and Nilepet itself....So Went we have the right people at work around Pres. Kiir then we will be liberated
6587 2018-03-13 13:17:54 Im 28, i was here when oil was 140 a barrel. Where did the money go? Why didnt we save anything? Why didnt we invest money and diversify our economy?
6588 2018-03-13 13:17:47 His goal was always to get the 500 Billion dollars of oil out of Russia, which will put a LOT of money in his pocket, so that is a scandal in itself.
6589 2018-03-13 13:17:40 Oil and Diet Coke.
6590 2018-03-13 13:17:30 Now he can go back to making money from Russian oil
6591 2018-03-13 13:17:26 Pompeo well known iran hawk. Go long on oil, iran deal might fail, means Iranian oil = contraband
6592 2018-03-13 13:17:25 .@fmonaldi: “The debacle of the oil industry is long in the making. It started with the politicization of @PDVSA and the over extraction of its resources by #Venezuela’s central bank.”
6593 2018-03-13 13:17:17 Good luck with that, Arnie  You can put all the warning labels you want on vehicles, gas pumps, quarts of oil, etc. When your car’s gas gauge hits the big “E”,  I don’t give a shit who you are, you’re going to be pulling into the nearest gas station and filling up.
6594 2018-03-13 13:17:16 Now it says 0 again. (referring to the oil gauge of my car.)

6597 2018-03-13 13:17:12 He even got sick! Poor Rex is going back to oil business, at least with the advantage of having a longer contacts list.
6598 2018-03-13 13:17:10 he didnt accomplish his goal of comming to start violence so that they can steal oil. he found a hardened Kenyta
6599 2018-03-13 13:17:06 I’m sure Rex Tillerson is relieved that he can go back to his old job of having passionate, absolutely disgusting sex with a barrel of oil.
6600 2018-03-13 13:17:03 Is Tillerson fired for what he said about the Russian poisoning or because the Exxon oil deal is off with Russia.....
6601 2018-03-13 13:17:02 Incompetent, self-interested oil executive replaced by sleazy Republican politician as Secretary of State.  Literal war criminal promoted to head CIA.
6602 2018-03-13 13:16:59 There is an ongoing investigation concerning Tillerson that leaves him compromised, and he’s replaced by CIA chief, someone more qualified as SecState than an oil CEO, what’s the problem? Timing is awful I would agree!
6603 2018-03-13 13:16:59 195 signatories to the Paris Accord + US Military + NASA + US Weather service + thousands US scientists vs. Trump & a handful of scientists, oh & the... oil & gas industry doing doubt merchants.  It’s a false equivalence.

6606 2018-03-13 13:16:42 No need for him in that position anymore since the oil deal fell through, now he can to original job. Russia has nothing to gain from the 13 trillion dollar deal you all had a stake in due to the sanctions that kept from happening
6607 2018-03-13 13:16:40 I have common sense
so you think scots need bailed out to tune of 13BN EVERY YEAR by those who take 92% of our oil and gas wealth?
A rich country needs bailed out by a nearly bankrupt one!
You must think Westminster tells the truth

6616 2018-03-13 13:16:12 getting fired is going to free tillerson to speak his mind and tell everyone the things he's been keeping under wraps. truth bombs like "oil is the only thing that matters. i love oil."
6617 2018-03-13 13:16:07 Read 120 day rules! Where are u folks from another part of the world ! We go to college maybe u should oust many and employ Tillerson to oversight ur hiring requirements! U folks have outrageous behaviors reading markets to manipulate outcomes for others IPOs. Oil coming off©
6618 2018-03-13 13:16:01 Guess Tillerson's back making billions in oil now. Only with this White House can you get fired and still be failing upwards.

6627 2018-03-13 13:15:23 Now Rex is totally free to pursue his oil deals with Russia. Everybody wins!

6630 2018-03-13 13:15:11 Tillerson has verified (by Congress) large off-shore accounts. Russian newspapers reported he has a deal for a stake in the Russian oil company deal worth billions contingent on dropped sanctions. Super dirty.
6631 2018-03-13 13:15:08 No! He still wants his cut of the 63 million acres of oil drilling from Russia! He won’t rock the drill!

6638 2018-03-13 13:14:39 The possibility of him entering the position to help move mutual goals between US and RUS oil entities and the possibility that he soon realized that he is working with "a moron" in his words that couldn't negotiate his way from a wet paper bag, can be mutually exclusive.
6639 2018-03-13 13:14:37 I’m gonna miss longtime oil executive and Russian Order of Friendship recipient Rex Tillerson’s integrity, mostly because he reportedly called Trump a “fucking moron” once.
6640 2018-03-13 13:14:32 Rex Tillerson was a moderating voice within the Trump administration on maintaining the #IranDeal. With Mike Pompeo in, is the deal as good as dead? #JCPOA #Iran #sanctions #oil #OPEC #OOTT
6641 2018-03-13 13:14:32 Oh man! @cenkuygur anchor and founder of @TYTNetwork predicted this! He said Rex was put there because Russia wanted to push through an oil deal with Exxon Mobil but since they pulled out of the deal last week he predicted Tillerson would leave soon after.
6642 2018-03-13 13:14:28 With the Russia oil pipeline deal scrapped no need for Tillerson and Exon Mobile any longer. LOL what a joke our gov is.

6644 2018-03-13 13:14:28 reminder that Rex Tillerson is a corporate big oil shill with ties to the Kremlin and should never have been the fucking Secretary of State. I fully expect his replacement to be a literal hobgoblin hand-picked by Putin.

6648 2018-03-13 13:14:10 I'm young enough to remember when he was named SoS & many criticized him for his ties to Russian oil and proof of more Trump "collision". Now he's too hard on Russia so he was fired? Hmmm 

Truth is, he's been on thin ice for awhile from what I've read before today.
6649 2018-03-13 13:14:07 Ummm ok.  So, billions of people will be driving cars with warning labels on them, and still burning oil.
6650 2018-03-13 13:14:03 Was this one approved by putin??? Has Rex done his job not investigating the Russian meddling in the last election and lifted the sanctions on Russia for oil, for which you’ll make a tidy sum with your 19% share in a Russian oil company

6660 2018-03-13 13:13:14 Tillerson (based on friend of friends sort of oil business buddies) never respected #Tillerson as a leader but, few think of him as unprofessional, so I guess it's wait and see as to whether he speaks or not.
6661 2018-03-13 13:13:14 Never forget that a magnate of the oil industry was to “establishment” for @realDonaldTrump         Only lackeys need apply #RexTillerson #Tillerson

6664 2018-03-13 13:13:07 “The extraordinary episode occurred while Dudley was CEO of TNK-BP, a Moscow-based joint venture with four Russian oligarchs including Blavatnik. Extraordinary because even in the turbulent world of oil, you do not often get a senior executive going underground”
6665 2018-03-13 13:13:07 What’s bonkers is that when Rex Tillerson was nominated, we all worried the oil and gas executive with making money as his top priority would be too greedy and reckless and the worst extreme of the Trump Administration. 

But he was the relatively sensible moderate one?!?

6678 2018-03-13 13:11:59 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

Tillerson was only brought on to assure sanctions were lifted on Russia. When that didn't happen Exxon killed the 9 trillion dollar deal making Tillerson useless. #TuesdayThoughts

6689 2018-03-13 13:11:04 Tillerson was a oil man. his exit short term does not bode well for oil.
6690 2018-03-13 13:10:59 Try CBD oil or better still real cannabis. That and a little exercise.

6692 2018-03-13 13:10:57 Rex. In the Shakesqueer challenge your performance was all double double Oil and Trouble and honestly how is it barely even 9 AM I’m so tired already
6693 2018-03-13 13:10:51 My rubles are on him concluding he can make the big oil deal work better from the outside.

6699 2018-03-13 13:10:29 Tillerson must have gotten his oil deal or whatever. Putin is our Presidet, he fired Tillerson
6700 2018-03-13 13:10:28 He was poo-poo'd when selected, the demon oil thingy.

Now the hysterics can start that he's been let go.

Former recipient of Putin's Order of Friendship.

I liked him in that position though.  I never get my way.

6705 2018-03-13 13:10:15 Tillerson is an oil/gas person. He’s made a lot of money in the past few years. Especially from Russia. He’s been in their pocket too. But with mueller closing in he’s breaking ranks. I wouldn’t bet against a mueller subpoena for Tillerson very soon.

6707 2018-03-13 13:09:48 Aaahhh. No. Tillerson was the CEO of EXXON. He signed a $900 billion oil deal illegally while Russia was sanctioned. He and Trump needed those sanctions dropped or deals off. Deal is off. He is extremely dirty . Worked with mercenaries to get oil deals using torture & death.
6708 2018-03-13 13:09:46 Donnie/Vlad were upset about Rex criticizing Russia.  Surprise, surprise. I'm sure there's a place waiting for him in the oil industry.

@FoodFood
6713 2018-03-13 13:09:27 Tillerson didn't get the oil contract so he was free to blame Russia for something it did; Trump probably got tired of this insubordination and did a rash move
6714 2018-03-13 13:09:26 وانا 9 العذراء اطلع عينهم معروف عني وفي النهايه يااشتري يااهون
6715 2018-03-13 13:09:22 Wow, Rex tells the news Russia was involved with the poisoning in England and now he's gone. #trump is Putin's pool boy. All he needs is the oil.
6716 2018-03-13 13:09:18 Year is 2021 and I look like Bobby lashley*, my shirt off everywhere I go and I carry pocket size can of coconut oil
6717 2018-03-13 13:09:14 @cenkuygur Spot on. After failed oil deal and criticizing Russia for poisoning scandal Tilly boy is gone.
6718 2018-03-13 13:09:09 Tillerson was only in it to juice oil money out of Ukraine; he was the one that forged that deal as Exxon CEO. Once congress passed new sanctions and the old sanctions remained in place, even though the new ones haven't been enacted, he was out. It's been only a matter of time.

6721 2018-03-13 13:08:56 Or in a more sinister take, DT is about to remove sanctions from Russia entirely. Rex w/be able to pursue the $500B oil deal he brokered. With a piece to Drumpf, of course.

6729 2018-03-13 13:08:29 Trump did Rex Tillerson a favor by firing him. He was about to resign anyway. He didn't get what he was there for (killing Russian sanctions for that oil deal), but they got tax cuts, sooo buh-bye. #plausabledeniability #flipflop
6730 2018-03-13 13:08:29 Remind me one more time what loose powder is for? I have the invisible oil blocking loose powder for black opal...

6740 2018-03-13 13:07:06 .@nytimes is calling Tillerson "among Trump's most well-regarded cabinet choices"… well-regarded by whom?? He's unambiguously a colluder between Russia and the executive and management class of the international oil business—at the expense, wherever relevant, of the US populace.
6741 2018-03-13 13:07:05 Tillerson may have been about the oil, but he was actually a diplomat. Mike Pompeo is not very diplomatic. I'm saying that as a Kansan, who has met and had several conversations with him. Pompeo will lean on military and saber rattle his way around the world.

6743 2018-03-13 13:06:53 Talks with North Korea looming.  Exxon oil exec or recent, former CIA Director in the room?  Hmmm... seems like a no-brainer, and very strategic move.
6744 2018-03-13 13:06:49 But what about that oil deal with russia? 
6745 2018-03-13 13:06:44 So- The 500 billion dollar Exxon / Russia Oil deal went through ? Or is it still in limbo ?  Tillerson
6746 2018-03-13 13:06:43 Someone screen grab this statement for Indyref2 when the billionaire gets involved! See, in Norway, the people got the billions from Norway's oil. In the 'precious' UK, the likes of Wood got the billions from Scotland's oil.

6748 2018-03-13 13:06:34 One of his first acts as Sec of State was to sign sweetheart oil development deals w/ Russia. That's probably what allowed him to stay so long!

6753 2018-03-13 13:06:25 Rex Tillerson is out so now let's hear from the liberal trolls what a great man this former oil executive was.
6754 2018-03-13 13:06:24 I'm really happy Trump fired Tillerson. Tillerson is an old school neo-imperialist that specializes in stealing oil from the Niger Delta for Shell, and propping up dictators for that purpose. Kudos to Trump
6755 2018-03-13 13:06:24 She wanted DT to win. She’d rather it be him than Bernie Sanders. She had to know more than anyone else nobody was showing up for her rally’s during the primaries and the momentum just wasn’t there. DT is doing wonders for her bank account and for her oil loving friends.
6756 2018-03-13 13:06:20 YESSSS!!!! That's the one! All the while people of Venuzuela are literally fighting for food to survive.  I would get so mad at that commercial. I have a friend that used to get her oil from that program. Cried poor mouth then buys concert tix and ps4 for her kids. 
6757 2018-03-13 13:06:19 Yea CIA boss is to take over
6758 2018-03-13 13:06:16 Started with Harborview.  Well underway.  Even our not so forward thinking Governor installed them at the Blaine House.

6767 2018-03-13 13:05:39 Lol then he fired the Secretary of State who was too hard on Russia after being in Putin’s pocket for his disastrous oil drilling. 
6768 2018-03-13 13:05:23 connecting dots seems so difficult for people. We need @billmckibben @NaomiAKlein and prominent voices on #ClimateChange to make these connections implicit! Its not just about extraction, its what we DO with oil that needs attention too!!! Alternatives aren't just solar panels ;)
6769 2018-03-13 13:05:21 OMG he looks like he needs a grande cup of oil to get him going this morning, I'm feeling that right now UGHHH. I LOVE THIS THANK YOU BROBALONE! I'm itchin' to draw Kit once I get caught up on mah to-do's too!

6771 2018-03-13 13:05:16 We knew this long ago. He was a oil tycoon short timer. He got what needed to be done. Onto next phase.
6772 2018-03-13 13:05:14 Sooo they couldn’t make the big oil deal work?   Or can REXXON do that more effectively from the OUTSIDE?   #TrumpRussia
6773 2018-03-13 13:05:06 Let's not forget Rex Tillerson was a Big Oil shill who used his position to further advance Big Oil policy worldwide.
6774 2018-03-13 13:05:04 So now Tillerson is free to cash in on all the oil deals he made with Rosneft, can go back to the quiet dignity of the private sector without having to cope with the pesky press sticking their mose in “his business.”
6775 2018-03-13 13:04:57 Can't mess up that oil deal long term, huh?! There's alot more to this story. Tillerson was ready to come down on Putin and you won't have it, cause you're bought and paid for, creep!
6776 2018-03-13 13:04:56 This may make it harder for him to return to his previous job of managing Russian relations for major oil firms…
6777 2018-03-13 13:04:53 C#あたりが一番好き
6778 2018-03-13 13:04:48 I like Rex, but honestly his heart never seemed in it. SOS is a big change from being an oil bigwig.
6779 2018-03-13 13:04:46 Now will he go back to sell oil?
6780 2018-03-13 13:04:44 Exxon just paid about 200 million for the botched oil deal with Russians. Tillerson was only there to push that deal through. Once it failed he had no need to continue... ask yourself why a stupid rich oil executive would want to go into public service at his age.
6781 2018-03-13 13:04:42 は？るせさん？は？？は？
6782 2018-03-13 13:04:38 The fascination, and pseudo science mumbo jumbo, around krill oil has long angered me. Omega 3 is Omega 3 no matter where it comes from. While I personally use plant based sources, there are enough by-product sources from the fishing industry to satisfy our need.

Added to above are: rice vinegar(if you don't have it, any ordinary vinegar), flax seed oil, olive oil, sesame seed oil(to modify the flavor), and wasabi[Japanese horseradish].
6784 2018-03-13 13:04:38 Perhaps the #Tillerson firing's a harbinger of the lifting of all sanctions against Russia. He's then free to pursue the $500b oil deal he struck with Puty. And #Drumpf is sure to get a cut. #SecretaryOfState
6785 2018-03-13 13:04:24 Hahahahah.....man ain't delivering on oil deals ...
6786 2018-03-13 13:04:17 Tillerson 100% asked to be fired over resigning.. he has dismantled the state dept and will get none of the blame... and now go back to Exon to cut an oil deal w. Russia
6787 2018-03-13 13:04:12 it's dumb expensive, but I can't even properly itemize how taking a teaspoon of fermented cod liver oil + high fat butter has changed my mental health.
6788 2018-03-13 13:04:05 Tillerson was hired for one reason,and one reason only to do big oil deals with Russia...
6789 2018-03-13 13:04:04 You for real?
6790 2018-03-13 13:04:01 I’m the same way! I’ve got Mct oil and ketogenicgirl dark chocolate bar with seeds in my purse right now! ;)
6791 2018-03-13 13:03:51 I made the mistake once of taking it to one of those 30 minute oil change places and they were confused as fuck. You pretty much need to do it yourself or take it to the Land Rover dealer and the dealer is $$$. They do a TON of stuff you don't need as well.
6792 2018-03-13 13:03:51 Trump appoints an Exxon mobile executive with interests in Russian oil amd no experience in diplomacy and now he’s fired.  Only the best people. Only the best
6793 2018-03-13 13:03:51 My skin is super oily, but i cant guarantee oil free face oo, but it will work a bit maybe come out as dewy at the end of the day. I forgot to tell u i also use ponds primer too with the milani.
6794 2018-03-13 13:03:48 Uncle Rex Tillerson, oil tycoon, fired as Secretary of State hours after taking a hard stance against Russia. The oil tycoon who's appointment to SoS reeked of shenanigans, is now the sympathetic figure? 
6795 2018-03-13 13:03:47 I thought #RexTillerson would have resigned long ago. Now that Exxon has ended its joint venture with  Russia’s state owned oil company, Rosneft, he is free; but not before sacrificing every last bit of his dignity to #DonaldTrump.

#Greed
#Shame
#Tillerson
6796 2018-03-13 13:03:44 Rex Tillerson has just been sacked... I know he’s an oil man at heart, but as SoS I didn’t think he was doing too badly (by that I mean no gaffes or international incident causing comments) #Rex
6797 2018-03-13 13:03:43 Pointing with right hand while holding out left for Russian oil kickback.
6798 2018-03-13 13:03:42 Red currant jelly is amazing on meat! But Chili oil is great on curry... Hmm which one is the best..?
6799 2018-03-13 13:03:39 Of two minds (re: oil);
1. Ultra hawks, in an echo chamber, unfastening their belts, tape measures in hand, is never good for long-term stability, thus good for oil.
2. If the worst occurs (open ME conflict), could create short-term oil shock, eroding structural demand.
6800 2018-03-13 13:03:33 It *is* hard to keep up. KALEIDA? Who owns Mike Pompeo?

... the AI in my head says, and I quote, 'Mr. 'Torture McTeaParty' is in the pocket of Big Oil, Big Guns, and Big Corn.'

So, a step up. >.<
6801 2018-03-13 13:03:28 I never thought I'd be MORE worried after the firing of the cartoonish oil executive Secretary of State, but here we are. #REXIT #RexTillerson #Rex

6803 2018-03-13 13:03:26 I’m sure there’s an Oil Major lined up already.

6812 2018-03-13 13:03:08 BREAKING: Trump ousts Russian oil investor Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, will replace him with Koch Brothers protégé Mike Pompeo
6813 2018-03-13 13:03:06 It’s time to go to sleep the commercials trying to sell holy oil and shit
6814 2018-03-13 13:02:58 That is BS: Tillerson got rid of hundreds of people of color, women etc. and helped to hollow out the State Department. He wants to go back to being CEO of EXXON now that he kept the sanctions from being enforced and the half trillion $$$ oil deal can go ahead. Pay attention!
6815 2018-03-13 13:02:57 Tillerson got all his oil contract in place and then quit.
6816 2018-03-13 13:02:51 Illarsu ya bayyana a baynal jama'a ai mun gani agrera
6817 2018-03-13 13:02:42 I don't believe in coincidences in the Trump years. Tillerson calls out Russia yesterday and today he is fired? Don't get me wrong, I did not fully trust Tillerson with his oil ties w/ Russia, but he at least had his head on straight when it came to the other turbulent countries.
6818 2018-03-13 13:02:39 จาเอาอันเล็กๆ ของพี่ไปแลก 
6819 2018-03-13 13:02:34 I barely use any skin care these days (since Im broke and I ran out of toner, aloe gel, essential oil, etc) but rarely get any pimples & never had any breakouts. I still deal with blackheads but they're, not bad a porepack once a week is enough

Should I make a thread for this?
6820 2018-03-13 13:02:32 I noticed Tillerson had slowly faded from the News.  I suspect it was Tillerson more than conflict.  Plus the Oil industry is beginning to rock and roll.
6821 2018-03-13 13:02:31 Heid rung UKOG and asked for more pictures to be put on for us.
My request has been emailed to various people and I am expecting a call back also. Go Heid !!!!! #ukog
6822 2018-03-13 13:02:28 มาช่วยพี่ก่อนนนนนนนนนน
6823 2018-03-13 13:02:26 Sure. If you want to be a sycophant for big oil CEOs who are cozy with Russia, go ahead. Personally, I think Tillerson has proven himself a poor choice by repeatedly undermining the President.
6824 2018-03-13 13:02:23 Rex Tillerson’s only reason for being Sec of State is to rid Russia of the sanctions and getting that oil deal. Can’t do it. Didn’t do it. No longer useful.
6825 2018-03-13 13:02:15 Supposition: He left Exxon to take that job to make sure the sanctions were lifted and not imposed so Exxon could work with a Russian oil Company to get the vest oil reserves from the north of Russia. That's the link. That deal just fell through, so he now has no more reason
6826 2018-03-13 13:02:10 Between that one and the almond and vanilla essential oil..
6827 2018-03-13 13:02:06 Loving Vincent is a great movie over that it's also a wonderful artwork animated by more than 100 artists with about 60000 pictures hand colored oil and my brother says they're so dumb because we already have technology why just don't make that easier. Why 
6828 2018-03-13 13:01:57 B.C. relys heavily on Asian investment but it won't allow a pipeline to feed oil to their investors in Asia?
6829 2018-03-13 13:01:55 Tillerson out. Something is up, it's a Russian Russia has ignored N Korean sanctions & selling them oil,  nuclear capabilities etc.
Rex said Russia poisoned Brits & needed to be investigated. Yet, Sarah Sanders & the White House were not happy, Trump refuses to go against Russia.
6830 2018-03-13 13:01:54 とてもえっちなライデンさん美味しいです...
6831 2018-03-13 13:01:54 Trump replaces oil millionaire Rex Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo as Sec of State. Nothing to do with Tillerson criticising Russia yesterday for murdering that ex-spy in the UK.

6845 2018-03-13 13:01:17 I so wish and hope that one day during these soapies or dramas would actually raise the notion that cannabis oil plays a pivotal role in reducing cancerous tumour, or healing cancer completely.

6876 2018-03-13 12:59:32 Tillerson’s statement about Putin yesterday was a warning to America.  I think that old conservative oil guy is finally coming around to understanding the true danger of a Donald Trump

6896 2018-03-13 12:58:19 I guess Tillerson got all the oil money he could get from being Secretary of State time to go back making shady deals as a private citizen

6904 2018-03-13 12:57:45 Not that the head of big oil was much better, but nothing says “trust us, we’re your allies!” like appointing the CIA to lead our global PR campaign. @RexTillersonWH was right, @realDonaldTrump is an absolute moron.

6906 2018-03-13 12:57:35 Funny how the MSM hated Tillerson as Sec of State when he was picked. Thought he was a big oil croney, now that he is leaving they love him.  No intellectual integrity, truly just supporting the opposit of what POTUS does. These positions are supposed to be temporary,not careers
6907 2018-03-13 12:57:30 Tillerson told too much truth on Russia, it seems. He can go back to his cushy oil job.

6920 2018-03-13 12:56:52 I really thought he was there for the oil deal. It's clear that Putin has moved beyond just the financial quid pro quo. Pompeo is another Russian stooge and will be running State and CIA at the same time.
6921 2018-03-13 12:56:46 Poor Rex Tillerson...it must be hard negotiating oil deals with Russia, while your Congress demands you put sanctions on. BTW, Gina Haspel has to be confirmed still....
6922 2018-03-13 12:56:46 One would think calling the President a moron would have served that purpose.

But what you say doesn't add up. President said Russian involvement wasn't proven no?  Tillerson said what? That it was? That wouldn't help an oil deal.

6926 2018-03-13 12:56:35 US inflation data very bullish for oil demand.  No rapid upsurge, thus creating positive demand environment fro stable, structural, growth. Worry if inflation too low, will erode cyclical demand.  If too high, will erode structural demand. Just right! #OOTT

6932 2018-03-13 12:56:00 I think Tillerson had completed his mission. Dismantle and weaken the state dept. So now, he is ready to go. Now that Pompeo, trumps stooge is in the State dept. u want to bet Exxon and tillerson get that billion dollar oil deal? Anyway another distraction, no stormy news today
6933 2018-03-13 12:55:58 Mr. Tillerson is gone. Although I didn't like the dude he was half way in the door to being current. The CIA chief takes over and who knows who fills that spot. In the churn. Look for an uptick in interest in Russian oil.
6934 2018-03-13 12:55:53 Big Oil certainly has in the past. But that's history. The super majors have accepted we have begun an energy transition and they are busy preparing for a low-carbon future. The deniers are now concentrated in the US independents, smaller service co.s etc. Oh, and Calgary. ;0)
6935 2018-03-13 12:55:50 Waiting for an oil change has to be one of the seven circles of hell.

6937 2018-03-13 12:55:40 Last time I looked, it already is produced overseas and imported and refined at Marsden Point- hence $8bn p.a on petrol imports. Domestically produced oil is all exported. Do you have data otherwise?
6938 2018-03-13 12:55:34 How do you get oil off clothes?
6939 2018-03-13 12:55:30 เรากลับไปหาแจมินก็ได้
6940 2018-03-13 12:55:10 Trying to get an oil deal with Russia. The Novichok burned hopes of that to the ground, that's why he publicly broke with DJT over Russian involvement in that - he was trying to get fired.

6943 2018-03-13 12:54:52 Merry Christmas to you! Oil is a lick, while blep is sticking the tongue out without motion.
6944 2018-03-13 12:54:41 I Posted about CBD  Oil being a  Billion Dollar Industry By 2020, 2 Months Ago. NOW, My Team is Now 5100+! #KeepWatchin 
6945 2018-03-13 12:54:37 This is about more than Tillerson calling out Russia. With the Exxon/ Russia oil deal falling through, there's no reason to keep Rex on. There is nothing shocking about this announcement.
6946 2018-03-13 12:54:34 It’s a different issue entirely. There is an entire industry in Florida built around scamming the elderly - particularly widows.  ‘Professionals’ sell snake oil, insinuate themselves into the lives of vulnerable people, and then take them for everything. Saw it first hand.
6947 2018-03-13 12:54:22 Rex Tillerson is not like Omarosa who has to peddle a book and go on TV and do interviews to make rent. He BEEN on. He’ll be aight. And he only wanted the job to secure Exxon’s oil interests overseas.
6948 2018-03-13 12:54:17 Try some all natural chapstick! Coconut oil is wonderful!
6949 2018-03-13 12:54:07 That’s the way oil stocks trade for sure F-me!
6950 2018-03-13 12:54:04 I don't blame Tillerson when no one knows what Trumps foreign policies are but non diplomacy with our allies but for dictators...give me a break. Trump couldn't get the sanctions lifted in Russia for Exxon oil...we all know why @realDonaldTrump fired him.
6951 2018-03-13 12:53:57 Only Trump could appoint the former CEO of America's biggest oil company to the Secretary of State post and then, against all odds, manage to replace him with someone even worse.
6952 2018-03-13 12:53:56 One bloke is out there saying it isn't Russia, it was Israel and Mossad creating a false flag to break UK/Russia relations because they're losing on Syria because they want Golan Heights oil and they make Novichok it's a FACT WHY CAN'T YOU DEAL?!? *breathe* 
6953 2018-03-13 12:53:54 any hashtag resister thinking that Rex Tillerson, former (and probably future) oil CEO, will somehow do anything not evil with himself after being canned is a deluded idiot.
6954 2018-03-13 12:53:49 God bless you, Governor @Schwarzenegger!!! But ... WATCH YOUR BACK!! This WH is SLAUGHTERING people in Middle East, including #Syria and Yemen to take-over BIG OIL!! I admire your COURAGE and send BLESSINGS, your way!! 
6955 2018-03-13 12:53:49 Yeah, no surprise as you and Russia can't do your oil deal and there's too much heat about the sanctions.
6956 2018-03-13 12:53:48 can but cannot exceed 20 mins depends on the instruction , kalau pakai face mask lebih dari stated on the bottle nanti mask tu absorb oil yang bagus on skin which will lead to extreme dry skin
6957 2018-03-13 12:53:39 Rex Tillerson couldn't get the Russian sanctions lifted in time so Exxon pulled out of the massive oil deal. Then he said Russia was behind the nerve gas attack in UK and Trump got him the f*ck outta there a day later. Interesting.
6958 2018-03-13 12:53:28 The Tech Turning Oil Industry Upside Down
6959 2018-03-13 12:53:26 But why land at sea at all? Safety? Maybe. Oil platform designed for stability.  Customizable for handling boosters. Still use ships or heavy lift Helo for transport.

6962 2018-03-13 12:53:16 Remember that Tillerson was HIRED because he supported Russian oil interests.

6971 2018-03-13 12:52:14 Am sure Tillerson's job was done when the oil deal didn't pan out. Dude had no reason being secretary of state. #jusayin. #DesperateTrump
6972 2018-03-13 12:52:11 He STILL thinks you are an idiot! And it's permeating through Midland, Texas oil companies that you are unstable. Texas will turn against you.

6980 2018-03-13 12:51:14 Is M. Pompeo one of us? Can we still consummate an oil deal with the Ruskies?
@realDonaldTrump Is Rex ok with your decision? He get's partial credit for gutting State!
6981 2018-03-13 12:51:12 I hope down. Maybe this puts in doubt all the North Korea "peace talks" Trump is bragging about, which could trigger a big reversal in the stock market. Either way, we await the fractals to tell us how to play the oil market. It's been a good morning there so far :)
6982 2018-03-13 12:51:11 Look at it this way: Implement a tariff, other countries stop exporting from US. That in turn will cause price of steel in America to go up. And it's in damn near everything.

The same way when a hurricane hits the gulf, & disables oil rigs, you know gas will go up because of it

6984 2018-03-13 12:50:57 I WATCH A LOT OF NEWS  BUT I SWEAR ITS DEPRESSING. LAST WEEK IT WAS SAID THAT 9JA WOULD START PRODUCING $16 BILLION WORTH OF OIL PER DAY. IF YOU ENTER NIGERIA YOU'LL THINK WE STILL LIVE IN 1940.
6985 2018-03-13 12:50:56 What shit of his borders on snake oil?
6986 2018-03-13 12:50:53 Noel Edmonds; right about bankers, so fucking wrong about cancer. He's essentially a snake oil salesman, peddling his claptrap to vulnerable people.

6990 2018-03-13 12:50:48 Part 3: ... he could buy them also - and so on. He focused on owning only that *one aspect* of oil: refineries (instead of owning all of the oil fields, all of the rigs, all of the shippers, & whatever other parts of the process there might be).
6991 2018-03-13 12:50:47 Excess oil in food like fried eggs, spag, noodles and rice is sickening..
6992 2018-03-13 12:50:44 As for it being 'your oil', sadly it isn't, despite whatever bleating you indulge in. As part of the UK it's all 'ours', in the same way that Welsh and English coal is, that ui used a lot of.
6993 2018-03-13 12:50:36 Ukwa cooked with corn with red oil, salt and pepper in the right amount.
6994 2018-03-13 12:50:35 nvm....my ass cant do anything without my oil.....fuck
6995 2018-03-13 12:50:34 I think he said it because he knew he was leaving. He only took a year off from Exxon. He wants that 500 Billion dollar oil deal with Vlad. He dismantled the State Dept enough that he can leave knowing he’s done his job.
6996 2018-03-13 12:50:25 Then you can distinguish the new oil.
6997 2018-03-13 12:50:23 So much for the 500 Billion oil deal! Trump is moving on to the next part of the agenda! Putin is pushing hard!
6998 2018-03-13 12:50:22 I don't believe Tillerson's fired. He did what he was put there to do, dismantle state dept. He's just been released to go back to continue oil deal!  #NewDay
6999 2018-03-13 12:50:18 He was a oil man, not a diplomat.

7145 2018-03-13 12:33:58 As I've said their are limitations but they are well understood.

Currency has always been a social construct, it was never really about gold, or oil or physical security.

It's function is just to facilitate the exchange of capital and labor.

7177 2018-03-13 12:30:58 I used to respect her. I was in Alaska (for work) when she voted against trump care. Then she took a big payout in opening more land for oil drilling and voted for the tax bill. It is nice to know what her price is. As the Million Dollar Man used to say “everybody has a price”.
7178 2018-03-13 12:30:50 Do not fear. If he wants to drill for oil, he is going to have a HELL of a time with a Pipeline.  He must have failed Geography in school. To get oil from Alaska to the rest of the US he has to go through CANADA land as well as waters. Not going to happen right now...

7235 2018-03-13 12:23:01 Yeah, "add oil" just doesn't do it justice, although that's the literal translation. If you watched any of the Beijing Olympics, you had to have heard the "Zhongguo jia you!" cheers throughout.

7246 2018-03-13 12:22:04 What exactly is that supposed to do? Because it’s still backing the oil? There are many different cancers and ‘some aren’t treatable’ as of yet. But if the oil is curing some why not do the research to be able to help people with it. So, so naive.

7306 2018-03-13 12:15:15 This talk is about cannabis oil not the plant? So maybe you should take a minute to read instead of jumping to conclusions. THC is what gives you the ‘high’ effect. I’m very much aware of this. But this is about what’s taking from the plant for medicinal purposes.

7359 2018-03-13 12:09:30 Mom used to be a lab assistant in a palm oil facility. She had a notebook that was meant for complex organic chemistry equations. It is now filled with her Sudokus.

7375 2018-03-13 12:07:48 I am sceptical of those figures. What s Scottish and counted as our export to either block or country  have some fairly dubious caveats I.e oil and whisky leaving an English port do not always count as Scottish export.

7412 2018-03-13 12:03:57 This is wrong, Chavez enjoyed oil prices higher than 100$ per barrel, he expropiated every farm he could find to give it to'the people'and predictably food production on our soil is now dead, since he had a lot of cash he imported food so it was all good, now that oil is at 50...

7444 2018-03-13 12:00:15 Almost seems like the government's policies aimed at expanding production capacity and output are skewed towards corporations that can wait out low prices while forcing SMEs to shutter or sellout. The expansion policy will probably undermine recent oil and gas startups.

7449 2018-03-13 11:59:41 its not just that. Sure the $barrel price does factor in but its the million and one other complexities of listing an oil giant like Aramco on any exchange, the 2018 was too ambitious.
7450 2018-03-13 11:59:30 TBH the only oil I know to be essential is olive oil, and even then, that's only for a nice vinaigrette.
7451 2018-03-13 11:59:22 General Motors must have oil corps as primary shareholders. All of their vehicles get piss poor gas mileage. Bad choice to choose if you desire a new vehicle. GM gives not a shit for us or our environment.

7499 2018-03-13 11:52:25 Banff has just installed a sea bin at the harbour to collect plastic waste from the sea; a potential catch of 50,000 plastic bottles, 30,000 paper cups, surface oil and micro plastics down to 2mm. It’s the first in the uk and it’s just so NICE

7623 2018-03-13 11:32:02 What oil cleansers do you recommend? I’d like to start including this in my routine but idk where to start 
7624 2018-03-13 11:32:02 Key word here is starts. If you think oil is going anywhere anytime soon, you don't understand how difficult it will be to replace 100 million barrels of oil per day in energy. It won't happen overnight. Perhaps you do understand, but still think it's too late?
7625 2018-03-13 11:31:35 @MellowOchre @ Unfortunately we are not in a good position, the majority of our gas from Russia, oil from the saudi's etc..

its bringing in more tax money than alcohol because they tax it like MAD & the gov do make their money off it.

Also, theyve just started to stock CBD oil products in Holland & Barrett  so there must be some sort of progress

7645 2018-03-13 11:27:08 We always get oil based for the figs, which I think would work for posters. Turnbuckle pads I'm not sure. Best thing to do is get a material similar to the pad, and test it on there

Instead we then got Bush's & fought a 4 trillion $ war because of oil & still fighting

7670 2018-03-13 11:24:13 Let us take a step back and reflect on this;

1. Shale technology is a serious challenge to our Oil and Gas Industry.
2. Further down the line, Deep Sea Mining could be a serious challenge to our Solid Minerals Industry.
3. This is just the 2nd decade of the 21st Century.

7710 2018-03-13 11:15:42 Cynically, perhaps the aim really is to test your ability to peddle snake oil? Reality shows have the same 'story' routine, except that there the participants try to convince TV viewers rather than an academic panel.

7726 2018-03-13 11:13:08 So true. Worth reading Winter is Coming by @Kasparov63 if you've not. West has not used economic weight adequately to counter - sanctions but still reliant upon Russian gas/oil, for example.

7751 2018-03-13 11:09:13 Economics IS a law of nature. Not Keynesian economics of course, but real, Austrian economics, the science of human action. And I’ll believe in peak oil when I see it. So far, all hat and no cattle.
7752 2018-03-13 11:09:03 you put the kernel between your hands, and then when you rub them it gets very hot so it expands. the oil from your skin makes it cook. that's science

7898 2018-03-13 10:43:56 Because in over 100 attempts, abolishing property rights has led to famine. This has happened even in Venezuela, a tropical country sitting on a huge oil reserve.
7899 2018-03-13 10:43:50 Oil diffuser w/lavender and citrus essential oils. It should help...
7900 2018-03-13 10:43:49 The US has not been invited to Syria. They have armed and trained ISIS and the "moderate" rebels in Jordan to take oil fields in western Syria and ship it through Turkey. There are numerous prudent investigations on this. Look up BBC "the jihadis you pay for". You have a PHD?....

7904 2018-03-13 10:43:10 I just read her diet plan. What a clusterfuck.

Cookies and fruit for breakfast.

Then a snack of fruit or raw veg.

Lunch: another cookie, and some veggie soup (and maybe a little meat)

Then a snack of fruit or raw veg or rice cake or rice cracker.

Dinner: AS MUCH CANOLA OIL
7905 2018-03-13 10:42:52 we should raise money, buy all the land, & throw out all palm oil plantations & restore native forests. Any ideas, suggestions how can we do that??
7906 2018-03-13 10:42:44 I hate cooking so it’s basically everything in a bowl and stir through with olive oil and juice of lemon/lime - greens are only ever blanched and beans pre-cooked. I’m a student so it also works as lunch in a jar!
7907 2018-03-13 10:42:38 When I am told treatments are not working and there are no more available treatments nothing and nobody will stop me using cannabis oil.

7910 2018-03-13 10:42:22 Fed up hearing this.  ‘Cannabis oil doesn’t work on all cancers’ well neither does chemo, people are being told they have certain amount of time to live. Yet use the oil and clear the cancer completely. Use your brain! #thismorning
7911 2018-03-13 10:42:13 Is it sad that my idea of “fun having” at the age of 29 is ordering takeout and binge watching Netflix/ Hulu ?  Or walking around my neighborhood?

7916 2018-03-13 10:41:23 The UK will NEVER legalise medicinal cannabis oil. The whole ‘cancer market’ is worth billions of pounds, cancer has existed since the beginning of time and apparently they’re no closer to finding a cure? THEY DON’T WANT TO FIND A CURE!  #ThisMorning

7923 2018-03-13 10:40:55 Agree, but they have oil and gas and nuclear weapons, a LOT of nuclear weapons and a pretty big army.They can cause a lot of crap and inflict a lot of misery.

8041 2018-03-13 10:19:54 Sport and politics, like oil and water don’t mix. England should enter into the WC after 4yrs of hard work. Don’t legitimizing an autocratic regime that has nearly all its individual athletes burned from sport for “dopping” offenses. Viva England!!!!!!

8044 2018-03-13 10:19:47 This government has benefitted by the increase in coal royalties. I'm sure there's enough CO2 for plants. save yourself from stupidity, before saving the environment
8045 2018-03-13 10:19:39 Gas and oil
8046 2018-03-13 10:19:21 Your conversation around coal & CO2 is unfair, incorrect, short-sighted & baseless. its dirty activism & could cause damage to Australia’s economy.
8047 2018-03-13 10:19:16 Russia's largest export is Oil, by a mile, it is one of the largest exporters in the world. Point of origin rules could also be used to prevent commodities generally entering the UK.
We could also call on other NATO members to impose sanctions due to what is essentially an attack

The US is exporting their "ultra light sweet crude".
And using all our "damn dirty Alberta oil" because thats what the majority of their refineries are built to process.
Canada ships more oil to the US than all the Opec member countries combined.(US, EIA)

8145 2018-03-13 09:59:04 Russia used WMD on Britain and needs to be cut off from rest of world.  Close diplomatic relations.  No travel outside of Russia. Other than to terrorist nations.  Treat it like a giant #DPRK. Wall it back up. Buy the oil and sell them cars.  Just don't let them cross the border.

8147 2018-03-13 09:58:35 Hmm, but surely JC's *strength* is his aversion to the lickspittle / weasel words school of politics?  I don't want to see another politician wringing their hands and saying 'shame' then rushing off to a Mayfair bar to discuss oil with a dodgy Russian.
8148 2018-03-13 09:58:31 I wouldn't be so harsh. But as renewable sources catch up, Middle East's oil run economy without any robust underlying economic structure will fall flat unless they invest heavily in education, industries etc.

8154 2018-03-13 09:56:09 I’m always heart pressed when I go get petrol and ask for the person to check oil and water and my tyres. It feels like so much 
8155 2018-03-13 09:56:01 Doesn't matter. Scotland is a nett exporter even without oil. Oil is just the cherry on Scotland's very significant cake. Any and all monies Scotland earns from its oil resources should go into a sovereign oil fund for a rainy day (just like Norway). We don't need to rely on oil.
8156 2018-03-13 09:55:59 No one believes anything #Tillerson the #TrumpFascists says.  He took his job to collude for oil.... nothing more

Do they realise that just off our coasts the tax from massive oil fields is being salted away by Westminster.
Look at Norway, tax money invested rather than squandered.

8162 2018-03-13 09:54:37 The dynamics of isis and Boko Haram are different isis was selling oil and that was their major source of income. Boko Haram don't have access to oil. You wonder how they'll be able to buy all that weaponry without forex?

8165 2018-03-13 09:53:41 I agree it’s like an Oil Company Drilling in an area where there are no oil deposits and expecting to bring in a gusher it’s not going to happen anytime soon, I have a feeling it’s more in line with keeping Muller and Company on the payroll.
8166 2018-03-13 09:53:22 It’s 5 am and I’m up like today isn’t wash day, I don’t have to do a hot oil treatment, clean my room and pack to move

8446 2018-03-13 09:04:22 Moisturise is so IMPORTANT  Your skin is like a fish and needs water to live. Without enough moisturising, the skin cells dehydrate and skin produces extra oil to compensate causing wrinkles and acne.

8504 2018-03-13 08:57:05 So many ladies on #GirlsTalkZA telling each other to moisturize their faces with coconut oil. NO!!!! Coconut oil clogs your pores, Lemon dry’s your skin and the acid is too harsh for your skin, sugar is too abrasive on your skin.

8507 2018-03-13 08:56:38 This is a small oil field produced by a Japanese company 30 years ago and produces seven thousand barrels, which is a joint field between Qatar and Abu Dhabi. Renewal with the Japanese is binding by both parties.

8565 2018-03-13 08:41:56 Sounds grim Daniel. Might be worth going on a vegan diet for a couple of weeks and avoid all oils as well (olive oil etc).

8896 2018-03-13 07:33:47 Next time you pop into a drugstore, this body balm by Kniepp is also good and I think fragrance free (the orange one anyway). It’s a solid oil so it’s easy to apply and not too expensive at ¥500 for the small size.

Why have you not looked at medical marijuana as a way of generating revenue from agriculture? The whole world is in demand of marijuana products. From fibre to medicine. Legalising marijuana will create a boom in Nigeria 
Check the cost of marijuana oil. @nassnigeria

8921 2018-03-13 07:29:37 Nope they won’t do that either. In essence that doesn’t hurt Russia anyway. 

Let’s be honest, the Russians have played the long game post Cold War and realise that they are untouchable. Too much reliance on Russia oil, gas and finance in the world economy.

This well attract any excessive oils, dirt/debris, makeup, sweat, etc... anything that-

8928 2018-03-13 07:27:54 . Technically speaking, can refineries install an additional light oil pretreatment system to strip out some light end stuff before sending down to cdu tower? Although i only saw some US refineries did that, but not outside of the US.

また、「SUNOKO」と間違えられますが「スノコ」の「コ」は「KO」ではなく「CO」なんです。

9179 2018-03-13 06:39:48 Im not endorsing deforestation nor pro palm oil but theres need to be a balance information on palm oil. palmoil is important to smallholders and villagers for survival and sustainable palm is the way forward.

9190 2018-03-13 06:38:20 there are some substitutes to palm oil but by replacing it with soy or canola or rape, the world just needs more arable land for cultivation n causing more deforestation in larger scale.

9320 2018-03-13 06:06:06 Cool. I've done digital work with a wacom tablet, and it is tricky to get the right look. I do portraits mostly in charcoal, oil, & gouche. I did one live on periscope on Sunday eve. Check my Twitt feed for the link if you're interested. :)

9467 2018-03-13 05:42:05 Especially the media taking part in rewrites are saying those that support oil and gas industry don't matter. They are cowling to the eco zealots and taking our voice away before we even had a chance to get fair coverage and air time.
9468 2018-03-13 05:41:49 It won't ever happen because the oil and natural gas industry will do everything in its power to stop it. Either that the world will come to an end.

9489 2018-03-13 05:38:50 Ah no. Projections show GHG emissions from oil sands activity eclipsing all other sources in Canada, single-handedly wrecking our tragets and reversing our progress. If the pipeline partly enables this, it is no distraction, it is your climate policy.
9490 2018-03-13 05:38:50 Hi. I am an Iranian born, educated ... and living in Iran. I would like to share our oil, tax and all other revenues with Syrian; Palestinians, Yemeni, etc. Please help me to obtain a passport from one of those countries. They are enjoying our revenues by themselves! Thanks
9491 2018-03-13 05:38:33 I don't think anyone has the answer to this until it actually happens. It will probably be determined in the court. I think Ottawa should mandate a fee for each unit of oil extracted. The fee would go into a fund reserved for cleaning up a spill.
9492 2018-03-13 05:38:20 OF COURSE
9493 2018-03-13 05:38:20 I feel terribly sorry. Since your area Doesn't have Oil, USA, China Russia had no interest. India could not act as local jihadists will revolt and that the worst night mare. We apologise, we did not come to your rescue...
9494 2018-03-13 05:37:46 Mr. Kenny, when the Canadian Federation was formed there were no provinces west of Ontario and very few people in the hinterland of the prairies. Back then oil and gas was irrelevant. A great deal has changed in the last century.

associating masturbation with the superheated oil eruptions that inevitably burst from a hot pocket is nightmare material
9628 2018-03-13 05:12:50 There really are no words to describe  this atrocious slanderous pathetic spew (a.k.a. speech) I certainly hope the Indian people are far wiser not to believe this snake oil peddling salesman

9643 2018-03-13 05:09:34 Really? Thanks Art... I grew up in Campeche near Cantarell. And just the logistics of carrying the oil workers to the plataforms, all those choppers, the scuva divers, etc. Made me realize that offshore  drilling even in shallow waters is very energy intensive.

9655 2018-03-13 05:05:58 The main differences between Petro and other cryptocurrencies are that it is the first cryptocurrency regulated by the government, which it would be easier to manipulate because it will be centralized by the president. Also, it is a currency supported by commodities like oil.
9656 2018-03-13 05:05:31 Make my own sign? Gee, the pro-pipeline shills get cash, signs, shirts, hats, transportation and other rewards from oil biz operators who are used to spending big dollars to manufacture public opinion. #bcpoli #abpoli #ProtectTheInlet #cdnpoli #StopKM

9663 2018-03-13 05:04:41 Relatively uncommon in the northeast. More common to convert from heating oil to heat pumps, particularly in areas without natural gas.
9664 2018-03-13 05:04:39 My two cents:

1. right-wing radio in early 90s. 
2. fox news in mid-90s. 
3. Now, every snake oil salesman that wants to make a buck knows you can scream conspiracy theories and these rubes will eat it up (Alex Jones). Book writers like Dinesh D'sousa, Ann coulter, etc.

9746 2018-03-13 04:51:09 There are biodegradable plastics.  I think a faster way to go would be to accelerate the breakdown of plastics to reusable hydrocarbons.  Bacteria are already capable of ingesting oil to cleanup oil spills.  Modify the bacteria or pretreat the plastic to make it digestible.

9773 2018-03-13 04:46:28 Notley is the one threatening to cut off oil to BC. She's the one who took it out on the BC wine industry. She's fucking all over us to risk our coast. You're hating her for the wrong reason. And the rest makes no sense either.

9779 2018-03-13 04:45:54 Well the sale of our oil would bring in a ton more tax revenue, like billions. Imagine what we could create with that? New technology, greener tech, infrastructure, ah but it’s from oil so we don’t need the $ right.  Give your head a shake.

9814 2018-03-13 04:41:23 Same! I baked chocolate chip cookie bars that strangely tasted like fish. Discovered my roommate had cooked a big slab of fish, wiped the oil off the cookie sheet, and put it away without actually washing it.

9863 2018-03-13 04:33:08 ENGOs blocking Canadian pipelines east, west to world markets and south to the US until the US was in a position to resume oil export after decades of no exports have served their masters well. Now Canada sends oil to the US at deep discount to buy it at world prices. Brilliant.
9864 2018-03-13 04:33:07 I think that there is a lot more oil in the ground here than you realize.

9884 2018-03-13 04:27:38 At least it wasn't snake oil - it worked.  How cool would it be to travel back to 1902 for just a day; and try Coca-Cola when it had 9 mg of cocaine per "glass" - maybe 8 oz.  A line is what like 50mg?  Not enough to get you high but definitely enough to get rid of the "Mondays".
9885 2018-03-13 04:27:37 I really dislike big oil... so mewch! I really wanted to go up to help out with water protecting vs the DAPL thing, but I was not able to. I was so angry when Pres Trump signed off on those awful pipelines... which ended up eventually leaking like everyone said it would. D:

9901 2018-03-13 04:24:10 Think of how much dirt & oil builds up on makeup brushes after each use. Wash them with a brush cleaner often.
9902 2018-03-13 04:23:55 "The Assad regime... continu[es] to wage war against their political opponents.” Opponents! No, these are jihadi headchoppers hired by the US to overthrow Assad so Israel can have the oil in #GolanHeights.

9904 2018-03-13 04:23:02 I didn't realize that the face mask I bought was made with coconut oil, which ALWAYS breaks me out. Lord please be with me because you know ya girl still put that mask on.

9921 2018-03-13 04:20:11 @JenBrinkle Very cool, and how long have you been into oil painting?
9922 2018-03-13 04:20:07 Ladies if your hair is dry and needs some love. Mix coconut oil, olive oil, and argon oil(or any oils you have really) and heat them. Apply to ends AND scalp and let sit for 2 hours under shower cap. Wash your hair after. My hair hasn’t felt this soft and healthy in so long !
9923 2018-03-13 04:19:58 Yes it is . The time for oil primed is a full 24 hours to dry. But well worth it. The value you save by doing it our self is $$. Oil primed are the most expensive canvases or panels. But if you do it yourself it’s very cheap.
9924 2018-03-13 04:19:51 I knew...at least my instincts knew. Love the snake oil...fits Obama perfectlg!

9933 2018-03-13 04:18:13 Big oil has the right dribble of revenue to politicians to maximize profits and bonuses without escalating tensions to Bolivian gas war levels
9934 2018-03-13 04:17:55 The only reason we are in Syria in the first place is to put an oil pipeline through it for Saudi Arabia and Nicki Haley shouldn't be covered as as she also tries to manufacture consent for going to war with Iran, probably for the same reason.

9940 2018-03-13 04:17:05 Agreed, but we can ALSO join in fighting for social justice, too, right? Not mutually exclusive but that said, fighting pipelines without watching our oil consumption is a bit hypocritical.
9941 2018-03-13 04:17:04 Uk expelled ambassador and applied diplomatic sanctions over last assassination. The sanctions should be economic to really make it hurt but Russians know that western finance loves their oil money
9942 2018-03-13 04:16:54 I put a drop of lavender oil in my water bc apparently it's good for you but it's so strong and I don't like it

My face is burning and my eyes are watering.

9958 2018-03-13 04:13:09 You are increasing tanker traffic from 5 oil tankers per month to 30 and that’s for starters. That’s a significant increase in risk out of Westridge! #BcPoli #canpoli
9959 2018-03-13 04:12:51 so are you suggesting there was no BC Liberal donation scandal? no published lists of oil industry donors? no RCMP investigation? 

and there are no lobbyists in BC / Canada?

9964 2018-03-13 04:11:18 Get a nice long whip for the equipment. IMO- Motorola’s have the best range. I run Kenwood, yaesu (can’t get anymore) and Motorola’s. Perk of living in oil country, pick up the radios used second hand. I have 2 baefung radios - handheld for grain bag operators etc
9965 2018-03-13 04:11:02 Inflation should come. China is exporting it, oil has made its statement over last 6 months. US runs at near full employment - wage increase will come next and when it does it will be red hot
9966 2018-03-13 04:10:56 “Give us more pipelines & we’ll help cut emissions” (ignoring the emissions others make with the oil we ship) sure sounds a lot like “don’t worry Charlie Brown, this time I’ll *definitely* let you kick the ball”
9967 2018-03-13 04:10:55 Ppl need to stop saying Russia is a superpower up there with America. Italy's GDP is half a trillion dollars more than Russia. Russia is the Hizbollah of superpowers, the strength it mustered comes from thuggery, crime, extortion and 5 years of oil barrels sold @ $100 and above.

9971 2018-03-13 04:10:25 Of course pigment quality is essential. We oil primed canvases while in school, but honestly it has always been difficult to have the available time to prepare with deadlines. I'd love to see comparative examples! I probably have the time nowadays, and a worthwhile extra step.

9978 2018-03-13 04:10:02 Indeed. Also, conservationally, today I read an article about Alaska, and what Sen. Murkowski is finally been able to accomplish with Trump's help--the drilling in ANWR! Yay, now the grizzlies will have crude oil! Oh, and clear cutting old growth forests, and blah, blah blah.
9979 2018-03-13 04:09:46 Nope...unfortunately, I’m afraid your only solution now is a good old fashion Oil Change
9980 2018-03-13 04:09:33 Ignoring more sanctions?? Hey Rexie Boy??? Getting a better oil deal for Excon? Comrade asshole
9981 2018-03-13 04:09:18 Your either got it, or you don’t.
9982 2018-03-13 04:09:02 Glad you're safe. Hopefully insured too. I've seen plenty of news stories of homes swallowed up by sinkholes due to fracking. OK, Texas, Ohio are just a few states. Oil and gas are finite. Hate seeing folks losing homes for consumption.
9983 2018-03-13 04:08:56 Huma looks like Olive Oil from Popeye
9984 2018-03-13 04:08:46 Regulations nice. Now you are talking my language. I’m not trying to be condescending at all I’m listening. I just think Enviromental groups like Susuki and media like Desmog are screwing canadians over in an advertisement campaign for substandard oil.
9985 2018-03-13 04:08:30 Hey friends, so friendly reminder that tanning oil has NO SPF and you WILL burn. 
9986 2018-03-13 04:08:15 Norway’s economy didn’t collapse when oil prices fell in 2014.  I wonder why 
9987 2018-03-13 04:08:15 It’s peanuts compared to the revenue oil brings
9988 2018-03-13 04:08:06 Use CBD oil to help while running. It will make a difference

9990 2018-03-13 04:07:36 Putin/Russia creates the mess and then expects everyone else to clean it up. Collapsing Venezuelas' economy by buying oil wells then stopping production. Providing North Korea with missile technology etc. @UN @NATO @VP @POTUS @Statedept @IntlCrimCourt
9991 2018-03-13 04:07:35 Following cause I want to learn how to do oil painting

9996 2018-03-13 04:06:49 So a product made with peanut oil can say they are made in a peanut-free facility if the oil is highly refined.

It's just funny
He's done so much to push murder and death in movies (and his SJW message in Junior, of a man having a baby).. and now he wants to fight against it?
9998 2018-03-13 04:06:34 if i ever see your god damned name pop up on my screen ever again i will fucking slam you so far into the fucking ground they find oil around your damn body you stupid piece of shit.

10001 2018-03-13 04:05:42 Congrats to tonight's @SantanaCarlos 50/50 winner who's taking home $3165 with ticket 110687C! Thank you, @RogersPlace concert-goers, for supporting  @MakeAWishNAB!
10002 2018-03-13 04:05:36 Indeed, I caught the oil v gesso reference, but really the manner in which I learned to paint yields a similar result, ie; hue, value, chroma control, in addition to opacity-translucency-transparency. My oldest oil paintings aren't old enough to determine fade.
10003 2018-03-13 04:05:27 .. Using for about 3 months. I use oil at night and then just splash my face with water in the morning and that's it! I think I've had 3 pimples in 3 months and they go away faster and leave less of a mark. Cannot rave enough.
