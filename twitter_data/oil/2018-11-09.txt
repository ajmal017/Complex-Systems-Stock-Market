7 2018-11-09 23:59:19 Inflation/rates has decoupled from oil price. Key question is, what is the main driver now? Evidence points to widening deficit having a larger impact, along with other factors of course
8 2018-11-09 23:59:18 I love it too! Every time I wash it, the color changes. It’s so fun to see how the colors fade. Except green. I added green for my “oil spill” hair before I learned it’s tenacious AF. I’ve found ways to make it more blue but I frickin hate it.
9 2018-11-09 23:59:17 Yes, but that’s not a specialty, lol. That’s more like taking a side job when you sell cars but can also do an oil change for a cash customer. “Election Stealing,” lol! I’ll recommend it to my Bar association for continuing legal education credit! 
10 2018-11-09 23:59:11 If you want to see what it really means for the electorate to lose faith, just wait til Brexit happens and none of the snake oil salesmen’s promises come true. 

Then you’ll have your crisis in democracy. And it won’t be pretty.

11 2018-11-09 23:59:02 Hey amigo long time no see! What's problem with palm oil? (Dumb yank asking ;)
12 2018-11-09 23:58:55 A big oil price change will change the price level, and it will show up in your inflation measure, but will not increase inflation level. If the CB does nothing the inflation bump will disappear after the price correction is over
13 2018-11-09 23:58:46 Snake oil...
14 2018-11-09 23:58:43 What is my answer implied I would ever advocate oil and gas?
15 2018-11-09 23:58:25 I should probably work on my car. I need a new back light, my front license plate is off, change the oil/filter and rotate my tires..
16 2018-11-09 23:58:20 Crude Oil closed lower for the 10th consecutive day, the longest down streak in history
17 2018-11-09 23:58:03 Stop it!  That's Peter Garrett from midnight oil gettin reddy to dance.

38 2018-11-09 23:57:55 Of course if he’s associated with a snake oil salesman, he must be one also
39 2018-11-09 23:57:53 Just so I understand. The punishment for Saudis abhorrent act of murder, is to deny the supply of oil the biggest oil producer. That’s showing them!
40 2018-11-09 23:57:47 Ain’t no way I’m 4,000 miles overdue for an oil change ... i jus cannot
41 2018-11-09 23:57:47 みんなも、使おうね！！！
42 2018-11-09 23:57:37 Actually so gassed that Iceland doesn’t use palm oil in their products because their mozzarella sticks are  #wouldrecommend
43 2018-11-09 23:57:29 I root for them to challenge each other to a naked wrestling match and then someone puts superglue into the oil they smear their bodies with prematch.
44 2018-11-09 23:57:08 It's more a political broadcast than a Christmas advert and right to be banned. Having said that, now I know more about it I support the sentiment and Iceland's move to ban palm oil.
45 2018-11-09 23:57:08 アロンソくんが煽ってくれるGif
46 2018-11-09 23:56:54 Makes finding oil and gas sound easy.  I’ll bet you could write quite a book.
47 2018-11-09 23:56:47 Is oil a bear market or will it reverse this trend? Could be a 1000 point trade back to $70 within 2 months could it not?
48 2018-11-09 23:56:17 They keep their freezers on 24 hrs a day, 365 days a year. Refrigerated Lorries transport ... palm oil aside, they have footprint. It’s a very successful viral ad campaign in the run up to Christmas. I’ll give them that.
49 2018-11-09 23:56:03 It has changed my life. I took Xanax and antidepressants for 22 years. Since I started taking cbd oil I have taken no pills!! 11 months now.
50 2018-11-09 23:55:46 I’m out of coconut oil . . How do I sleep like this .
51 2018-11-09 23:55:39 I'm curious .... once the wildfires become the norm in America from climate change, what happens to a giant oil trail (pipeline) running through the country???
52 2018-11-09 23:55:36 Why on earth was this banned. They should be congratulated, we do not need palm oil in our food.
53 2018-11-09 23:55:36 Aye...aye @westernandrose this umm Tobacco Bourbon body oil is a good problem you’ve created. #westernandrose
54 2018-11-09 23:55:29 Well Paul we are getting told what to do with Brexit & with Trident being based here the now. Previously with the Iraq war, with our oil & gas, with the higland clearances, with the banning of bag pipes & Tartan, at one time. An equal partner we most definitely aren't.
55 2018-11-09 23:55:26 Agreed. My Dad taught me how to change the oil in my car and change a tire.
56 2018-11-09 23:55:22 Much better than the snake oil salesman we have now
57 2018-11-09 23:55:19 you should have a wellness shot, they work! w wheatgrass, grated ginger, cayenne pepper, lemon juice and oregano oil 
58 2018-11-09 23:55:02 Me to Ivy: “The first rule of cooking is this: olive oil.”
59 2018-11-09 23:54:56 tolong jwb ya. other than HA, glycerin, vit E and olive oil are ingredients good for hydrating skin 
60 2018-11-09 23:54:39 You always knew there was either a maxi or allegro in front of you by the smell of burning engine oil
61 2018-11-09 23:54:32 LASHES AND BROWS
- even if our not filling your brows or using mascara, you can take steps to get luscious lashes and thick brows naturally. brush your brows and lashes with vaseline or castor oil every night before bed to thicken them and make them darker.
62 2018-11-09 23:54:24 Snake oil cure?
63 2018-11-09 23:54:22 @IcelandFoods why would you replace palm oil with butter and lard? That’s 1 huge step forward but 2 steps back.  Any animal product is massively damaging to our planet too. 
64 2018-11-09 23:54:07 Also, if you want to author a blog on good hash, you can send it my way and I’ll submit my reviews on that as well. Finished a vile of TrueClear oil recently that I could easily get 500 words out of. I’m just a generous guy that way, m8. 
65 2018-11-09 23:54:02 I like the 1000 mg oil and Magnesium pain relief cream from HBNaturals!

67 2018-11-09 23:54:01 Saudi Arabia commits state sponsored murder of a reporter in their consulate in Turkey. Saudi Arabia helps flood the world with oil. Gas heads towards $2.25 a gallon. Murder?  What murder?  Saudi Who?
68 2018-11-09 23:53:26 sist mau freeman nya yang manuka honey + tea tree oil nya dong, mau nyoba pake freeman, karna muka ku jeraawatan dan minyakan, pengen beli tapi aku missqueen:') aku dom lampung. btw exol ya, ayo kita mutualan eri, streaming tempo terus yaa
69 2018-11-09 23:53:24 How does BNNBloomberg square Brett Wilson’s Twitter presence/temperament w/ serious discussion about any business subject. His online harassment of a female Cdn minister, or w/ anyone who might object to all oil, all the time objectives.
70 2018-11-09 23:53:01 When I get olive oil on my hands I don’t wash it off. I rub it in. #trueitalian
71 2018-11-09 23:52:56 Im so stupid like how tf do i forget to put my oil cap back on
72 2018-11-09 23:52:50 Gasoline prices continue to slide. Demand down.
Fleets like Walmart's converting to natural gas or electric. Businesses refuse to deal with oil prices manipulated by oil oligarchs.
73 2018-11-09 23:52:47 I like the it cosmetics bb cream and the milani foundation!! Rosehip oil is good to put under matte foundation!!
74 2018-11-09 23:52:45 I somehow don’t see all the free speech ‘protectors’ getting angry about Iceland not being allowed to run their anti-palm oil Christmas advert..
75 2018-11-09 23:52:41 Pepermint dream colletion is ready to ship 35 plus shipping does anyone want it? Comes with bath bomb bath salts bath fizzy and a oil. The oil can be added to the skin directly  for soft shiny and smooth skin. Of interested let me know now
76 2018-11-09 23:52:38 Progress has to start somewhere. Oil, gas, and coal peeps can spend more and re-route as long as they start to honor all treaties, protect any and all water sources, protect national forests and parks, and think about everyone else first going forward.

77 2018-11-09 23:52:30 Hummmnn. You are truly an overCUMer. Calvary greetings MIDEY oil.
78 2018-11-09 23:52:23 lol oil money
79 2018-11-09 23:52:18 big oil dropped 20m+ on the no effort... 

If the world functioned we would judge the value of a nation by how much effect they had on improving the planet rather than their gdp
80 2018-11-09 23:51:43 You clearly missed the part where I said it isn't right. Nobody deserves to be attacked, period. Doubly so the family of a person. The point being that Tucker is a truly awful person; a snake oil salesmen to white fears. 

Finally, of course I don't support fascism. Sheesh.
81 2018-11-09 23:51:42 I'm in PA, one of the highest gas taxes in the country and the price of gas is going down along with the price of a barrel of oil.
82 2018-11-09 23:51:33 If I‘m paying to change my oil, I expect a full fucking change. Not 6 of the 7 quarts my car requires, what the fuck. Yea go ahead and fuck up a performance engine. Thx.
83 2018-11-09 23:51:30 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
84 2018-11-09 23:51:22 I be cutting back on oil at the wrong times of the year. This lil ass frame ain’t gonna make it thru winter 
85 2018-11-09 23:51:22 Go easy on the oil!
86 2018-11-09 23:51:16 Sounds like Matt Whittaker had his own Trump University snake oil scam. What a perfectly crooked fit for Trumps AG IG (impeachment guard).
87 2018-11-09 23:51:09 Who really cares about monkeys. Give me my palm oil!
88 2018-11-09 23:51:03 Article argues:
"The case for the new pipeline would be solid even if there were no need for a carbon price. ...the argument for a broad-based carbon price would have merit even if...Alberta’s oil sands did not exist, or if the oil became too expensive to bother exploiting."
89 2018-11-09 23:50:59 Did you know you can legally put anything on your Friday night DiGiorno before you cook it? You could put cookies on it. Motor oil, sticks and stones, marshmallows, motor oil, notes to old teachers that had a great impact on your life in middle school. motor oil.
90 2018-11-09 23:50:53 Some charge that the MBA's are too arrogant and yet as one black student put it: I didn't think and yet sometimes the black chevron oil engineering students think they knowmore about finding oil deposits and yet decision making under uncertainty, cost accounting, micro and macro
91 2018-11-09 23:50:45 Not sure. PG-13 & Deadpool are like oil & water
92 2018-11-09 23:50:45 Disappointed with @ToyotaGB Aygo after is amazing MPG I take it for it 2nd service and now it's down on power and MPG by almost 10mpg. On reviewing receipt I find the main dealer has used 5-30w oil not specified 0-20w any of my Twitter followers know where to go from here #fail
93 2018-11-09 23:50:41 I’m thinking he wanted the oil price low because of the mid terms and now he couldn’t care less it will go up again...
94 2018-11-09 23:50:40 Great, no oil, no war!!!
95 2018-11-09 23:50:36 The #IcelandAdvert has made me dig into products/companies that use palm oil and I'm shocked at how many have/use palm oil in their products. Goin to try my best to avoid them now #SavetheOrangutan 
96 2018-11-09 23:50:33 Home heating oil is #2 fuel just like diesel, only difference is it's dyed for tax purposes. Therefore, this winter if you're in a pinch and can't afford the minimum delivery you can use a few gallons of diesel to hold you over and keep you warm. #tip #lookingout #brotherskeeper
97 2018-11-09 23:50:32 Of course Iceland knew this. You’re missing the point. Cosmetics companies do not want people knowing that Palm Oil is destroying the habitat of the orangutan. The are censoring our media by forcing media networks to refuse to show this ad.
98 2018-11-09 23:50:23 Well, oil price is on what looks like a strong trend down on weak demand, especially in China, and the NZ dollar is heading back up, and as it is these factors, not small tax increases, that drive petrol price, Nat’s attack armoury is thinning out (already over banked the Czech).
99 2018-11-09 23:50:21 Alberta and Sask need to get serious.  I hate to say it but they should have referendum on equalization, periodically halt oil, not buy BC wines, inspect BC transport going through ...There are smarter people than I, but force some negotiation.  And challenge in Supreme Court.
100 2018-11-09 23:50:20 In the city I'm in, there's an estimated 4 days worth of food on the shelves for the population we currently have (100,000 People or so). With the end of oil (which is inevitable) what will happen on day 5? 

will an ipad be as useful on day 7?
101 2018-11-09 23:50:17 Looks the the oil out of my van that 
102 2018-11-09 23:50:15 @VINNYGUADAGNINO help a keto sister out, been looking for the keto dough recipe you used to make the ricotta truffle oil prosciutto pizza.... help!!!!!
103 2018-11-09 23:50:05 Well.... I'm actually disappointed I didn't get to use my snowblower this morning ... I got it all set last week .. oil change, plug, ran out old gas.. new gas... all set ... So .. lots of white but warm pavement .. so.. no shoveling.. that's ok
104 2018-11-09 23:50:01 I need to move tf back to philly. I gotta pay 50 for this oil change AND it’s gna take an hour and a half???? When I’ve been getting free oil changes and it took 30 mins???????? The bullshit.
105 2018-11-09 23:49:47 american oil companies can relate
106 2018-11-09 23:49:45 I used the white indica oil
107 2018-11-09 23:49:38 Do pipe down, if you had an idea what a good Brexit was you’d have had a bloody plan on 24 June 2016. You’re now just noise - I hope the good people of Haltemprice & Howden have seen you for what you are - a snake oil salesman who refuses to take responsibility for his actions.
108 2018-11-09 23:49:34 Time to oil up..... again. Have to be consistent in my use to keep me at my best. #essentialoils #momlife #wellnessadvocate #mompreneur
109 2018-11-09 23:49:32 A few treatments for ear mites may be used on all pets in the house without issues.

One well known brand name is Dr Dogs Ear Oil. This is natural and it will get rid of [keyword] efficiently and safely. It has no dangerous chemicals or pesticides and it has natural antibiotic
110 2018-11-09 23:49:20 Oil transport by train and truck are at record highs. We as a society still use oil and gas. Consumption world wide is up. Canada unfortunately sends money to regimes such as Saudi Arabia which aids their repression. We should instead be sending western crude east.

114 2018-11-09 23:48:57 My mom inherited some of his oil rights. There's a big difference between that check of $500-700 a month and decades of wealth accumulation
115 2018-11-09 23:48:57 i gotta do the whole oil in the ear trick heres hoping i dont go deaf
116 2018-11-09 23:48:56 And in case anyone is wondering, when he says “our relationship,” he’s referring to his family’s relationship laundering oil money for oligarchs.
117 2018-11-09 23:48:56 OiIwa?? Oil wa?? ???? what is that?
118 2018-11-09 23:48:46 Elton johns husband had an affair with a married man and then they had a threesome with his husband in a kiddie pool filled with olive oil

Did you expect that
119 2018-11-09 23:48:44 CBD oil ?
120 2018-11-09 23:48:33 How about banning palm oil itself?
121 2018-11-09 23:48:20 Is it because of the massive oil leak in the White House?
122 2018-11-09 23:48:18 @Greenpeace Well done on the Iceland ad even though it appears this ad has been banned solely because of your involvement. Iceland's name is on it, it involves their products and they should be able to advertise their banning of palm oil and be APPLAUDED for it!! I will spread!!
123 2018-11-09 23:48:13 You should have seen the number of ads that gas and oil companies ran against it. They were the only ads I saw on my streaming services the past two months.

125 2018-11-09 23:48:06 Ratatouille calls for olive oil
126 2018-11-09 23:47:56 Great mysteries of our time:

Why, if we had a space ship strong and fast enough, and we flew to the edge of the universe, would we end up back where we started?

Why are KitKat Chunky bars getting smaller?
 
Why is the Iceland Christmas TV advert banned? (Palm oil production?)
127 2018-11-09 23:47:49 Who tf knew that baking your eyebrows stops the oil???
128 2018-11-09 23:47:49 This is an interesting way to say that the banks are behind the people pushing regime change in Iran for oil interests no doubt.

133 2018-11-09 23:47:30 no need to do it to your detriment. get it for a friend and take a peak. try the oil instead :)

135 2018-11-09 23:47:24 But yet there's so much construction in town. All that equipment running on gas and oil. The @Google site has had cranes running for 2 years now.  I see big trucks delivering bottled WATER!
136 2018-11-09 23:47:18 Literally ads against it for weeks, all sponsored by oil/petro/chemical companies. Every commercial break in a show had one. Curious to see how much they spent on the ad blitz.

140 2018-11-09 23:46:53 @IcelandFoods Thank you for raising a huge issue that has bern close to my heart for a long time! I hope with the banning of your Christmas Advert you may have raised the profile of palm oil usage and the devastating effect it has on our orangutan population #banpalmoil
141 2018-11-09 23:46:52 So much negative media about oil, not seen since last time it bottomed and rallied 300%. Has to be a buy signal. My tip around 58.50
142 2018-11-09 23:46:49 I thought my car died turns out I just needed an oil change
143 2018-11-09 23:46:43 The guy changing my oil today said 
“Wow you’re so mature for being 22”
And without thinking I replied with 
“Thanks it was the trauma” 

144 2018-11-09 23:46:40 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
145 2018-11-09 23:46:28 Thank you Iceland. Palm Oil is a completely unnecessary commodity. I will definitely be visiting your store, got one few miles away. Parking was an issue but Rang-tan's more important,
146 2018-11-09 23:46:25 Haven’t saw it yet and don’t need to go know exactly what goes on in the palm oil industry. They don’t care about The orangutans at all. Big corps wanting money money money. I no longer buy anything with palm oil in it

148 2018-11-09 23:46:09 The Iceland advert was banned because it's a political statement, which the UK advertising guidelines ban. Otherwise we'd end up with political adverts like America. Whilst use of palm oil is terrible and absolutely should be banned, iceland is using the guidelines for a PR stunt
149 2018-11-09 23:46:08 CRUDE OIL UPDATE

Oil markets on Friday remained weak as rising supply and concerns of an economic slowdown pressured prices, with U.S. crude now down by around 20 percent since early October

153 2018-11-09 23:45:40 Oil will be the death of our Planet
154 2018-11-09 23:45:17 I talk to @Clearcast on a daily basis, and can I just say, you're all directing your hatred to the wrong people. They are just doing their job. Every single UK advertiser is held to the same standard- If you're upset by the use of Palm oil, protest against it to the right people
155 2018-11-09 23:45:15 I need an oil change
156 2018-11-09 23:45:14 coconut oil is trash
157 2018-11-09 23:45:10 I see nothing wrong with this advert... unless you object to truth!  The palm oil industry is killing off Not only Orangutan’s, but, indigenous peoples.   It takes plenty away from the earth too... all it leaves is a massive scar, where once beautiful trees and flowers grew
158 2018-11-09 23:44:55 Any truth to the twitter rumor I saw that The Donald was a business partner with Whitaker’s dad (olive oil)?
159 2018-11-09 23:44:54 Isn't this just a clever distraction from the actually cr*@ and unethical food Iceland sells....also it's not a Christmas advert is it, it's a campaign by Greenpeace. Think about it folks Iceland probably doesn't give 2 sh*@s about palm oil but it does care about marketing !!
160 2018-11-09 23:44:52 Not only that, but they didn't waste all their oil wealth by giving massive tax cuts to the rich, so they have a very healthy sovereign wealth fund...
161 2018-11-09 23:44:48 Big oil came in and flooded the place with negative and false ads.  It was everywhere
162 2018-11-09 23:44:43 Pro tip: put the oil on when your body still wet when you get out the shower.
163 2018-11-09 23:44:38 We don't have oil. Unfortunately we let go of Norway in 1905. Sweden only has ore.
164 2018-11-09 23:44:37 I feel good about my trading success with oil. Only confusion for me was market not covering shorts last friday, a week ago, that was risky with lack of info to public, like insiders had info I did not, that's a problem too for me but I adjusted and back to hittin a lick. ^5
165 2018-11-09 23:44:32 Also, check out CTFO's CBD oil healing products hosted by Tigerproducts1@cew1082.myctfocbd.com.
166 2018-11-09 23:44:23 Singapore is rich - it’s outside of the EEA and EU and has no oil, so is Hong Kong - your point is?
167 2018-11-09 23:44:12 Viking: there's more Oil
IR there's heat underneath Bagnold
There's a large Canyon active going under it
168 2018-11-09 23:43:46 My nails not done I absolutely deserve to be pumping gas in the cold. Might as well change my oil too
169 2018-11-09 23:43:44 America is pretty good at forgetting the CIA backed overthrow of Iran's democratically elected government in 1953 however and the installation of a US friendly dictator for oil interests.
170 2018-11-09 23:43:33 @IcelandFoods Xmas advert is very good in raising awareness for deforestation and palm oil. And people need to take notice . Human beings are the worst for this planet .... However it really isn't a suitable Xmas advert
171 2018-11-09 23:43:24 Pathetic decision Clearcast. Iceland are taking the necessary step of removing palm oil from their products. They're advertising why they're doing that so that we can support them by buying said products. U-turn your decision or refer it to the ASA so we can hammer them instead.
172 2018-11-09 23:43:22 But that’s all i got unless you have vegetable oil and an egg.
173 2018-11-09 23:43:07 Cheers for the paraphrased “Wrath of Khan” reference, but you may be surprised at how many people can benefit from cannabis. Now, they might be able to use edibles or the oil, but there may be more than just a few who will need to smoke, and in public at times.
174 2018-11-09 23:43:06 I suffer with fibro and only cbd oil helps! With out thc which I can’t put in my body!!!! So making it into a hAir product is a smart idea!!!! And with someone who has virgin hair, I want to try @KailLowry  products :)

179 2018-11-09 23:42:32 random question but do you guys have a favorite scent? like i love smell of rose water and lavender oil it makes me go 
180 2018-11-09 23:42:21 #IcelandAdvert Saving the environment is too political for television... let's stop the destruction of the rainforest. Don't buy any products with palm oil from unsustainable sources. (It's surprising how many things have this stuff in them...)
181 2018-11-09 23:42:12 Probably - with the UK as a major player in it. Did you know Canada is obliged to supply 75% of it oil to the USA via "free trade"? Trump just forced them to change IP, and privacy laws etc. to benefit American companies. They are a vassel state to the US. Not even a state.

184 2018-11-09 23:41:48 Well they are good at that so should come naturally. When in fact have they EVER told the truth or apologized to the millions who have suffered ill health or died due to coal and oil burning that they have caused.
185 2018-11-09 23:41:26 take away his rosehip oil
186 2018-11-09 23:41:26 Wow. That's Rich. BUSH Sr./W didn't start wars? Costing how many American lives for what? So, Cheney and Halliburton could get access to oil. There were no WMD's remember. It was Obama brought 15K + troops home alive. We are still in Afghanistan almost 20 years later.

-Support LGBTQ2 as PC/UCP don't
-Combat climate change & support oil industry
190 2018-11-09 23:41:13 Like beard oil and bean farts.
191 2018-11-09 23:40:53 @Clearcast we do not understand why you have banned this advert from being shown. Surely raising awareness of deforestation and the overuse of palm oil is vital & what a better way of doing it than at Christmas! Let’s overturn the ban and show @IcelandFoods advert this #Christmas
192 2018-11-09 23:40:52 I do have a couple of medicated oils I made that I wanna try I made this delicious lobster oil that gets ya schmaked  but uhhhh can’t decide how I want to use it. I also made this medicated olive oil vinaigrette that I love using for salads  
193 2018-11-09 23:40:48 And not knowing much about the car except maybe where the oil is and where the water is and where of that when she'll wiper stuff goes… I poke around and decide oh it must be the oil. When it might not have anything to do with the oil. And it might not be under the hood /1

208 2018-11-09 23:38:48 I saw oil under a bush and me and my friend were yelling at eachother about it and I ended the argument by making a funny noise.

215 2018-11-09 23:38:09 Are @IcelandFoods still selling own brand products which contain palm oil? The advert implies they are removing it going forward but how much current stock do they still have?
216 2018-11-09 23:38:08 ใช่
217 2018-11-09 23:37:57 As far as I'm concerned, I never use palm oil products and plan to keep it that way.
218 2018-11-09 23:37:46 @Ofcom I am OUTRAGED the Iceland ad has been banned.This ad is about banning palm oil and should NOT be banned just because Greenpeace in any way assisted in the making of it. It is about Iceland's products and they should be able to advertise this fact and be APPLAUDED for it!!

230 2018-11-09 23:36:52 I’m pretending like this is because I’m such a big drinker, but it’s really because my only choice of mixers is limited to chicken broth, olive oil, or some teriyaki sauce that expired in 2015.
231 2018-11-09 23:36:45 Still wrong whoever helped ban it and yes, we definitely should boycott palm oil products
232 2018-11-09 23:36:31 We could. We could also be hit by an Asteroid, or a Cataclysmic Earthquake that kills us all. But they are very extreme ifs & buts.
Right noo, trillions of barrels ae Oil is taken oot anywye, but Scotland isny seein the benefit mate.

236 2018-11-09 23:36:00 The US is the largest exporter of oil and oil products.  How about America First? Sell gasoline and diesel for $1.50 for the USA, then sell to all foreign at $5.00 a gallon. Ameica first, do we really need to remind our politicians?

240 2018-11-09 23:35:42 We have bigger military bases overseas than anyone else to control the flow of oil and goods to our greedy country. China is using our model. You are a #fuckingmoron #ResignNow
241 2018-11-09 23:35:41 I’m guessing it is linked to the production of palm oil. 
242 2018-11-09 23:35:35 Someone should have come up with an internationally agreed definition of what a terrorist is that includes a sub definition of state sponsored terrorism aimed at securing regime change and access to oil.

244 2018-11-09 23:35:19 I know this was a while ago, but I’m looking at buying oil now and the Proraso gets great reviews! Can you buy different scents at SDM? There seems to be 3... I want to compare the Wood & Spice and the Azur Lime.
245 2018-11-09 23:34:55 Perfect timing. Just finished Palm Oil.
246 2018-11-09 23:34:39 no the  recent wars motivated by oil definitely are

249 2018-11-09 23:34:27 I 110% agree. I lean more on the mint side though. Also sometimes it smells of lavender, I think. Kylo’s sometimes smells of rose oil.
250 2018-11-09 23:34:22 Its only Africans who buy anointing oil for protection from a pastor who has 7 bodyguards.
251 2018-11-09 23:34:20 okay ladies I have a suggestion that works if you’re not allergic to it and it’s non comedongenic meaning it won’t clog pores.... olive oil and some tissue to melt and wipe ur makeup off

254 2018-11-09 23:34:04 Glad to hear it (and glad you can hear now )

I use the ear oil every once in awhile now, like a preventative, knowing my ears get ultra icky and land me at the doctors otherwise. Might help for the future! Also always fun to see how much my hearing improves!
255 2018-11-09 23:33:58 La vrai réponse à la pollution n a jamais été l augmentation des taxes sur le carburant. On veut pénaliser le Gas oil. Et bien soit, baissons les prix de l essence pour le mettre au niveau du dit carburant.
256 2018-11-09 23:33:46 Yeah, but it's nearly impossible to find prepared food without soybean oil. You couldn't imagine a more effective mass-neutering program than soy subsidies.
257 2018-11-09 23:33:46 Palm oil is the worst... It destroys forests, displaces indigenous tribes and wrecks the bindiversity.
258 2018-11-09 23:33:41 @joerogan what CBD oil do you trust and recommend?  Looking to treat joint/chronic pain.
259 2018-11-09 23:33:37 Reminder to Vegans/Vegetarians that a great next step is stepping away from many processed foods/products that contain ingredients such as Palm Oil that they extract through deforestation and destruction of environments versus domestic agriculture

261 2018-11-09 23:33:17 The sadder thing is, palm oil is basically in everything we eat, store bought
262 2018-11-09 23:33:04 NO Dr Swann......it is all about Iceland banning palm oil and should NOT be banned just because Greenpeace in anyway assisted in the making of it. Iceland's name is on it, it involves their products and they should be able to advertise this fact and be APPLAUDED for it!!
263 2018-11-09 23:33:00 寝る前にきのこ送る人がいるんですか？？
264 2018-11-09 23:32:59 Just seeing that @Clearcast banned the @IcelandFoods advert. Can just imagine the complaints to @ASA_UK and @Clearcast now when anyone thinks an advert is political. Also Iceland will still be selling plently of products which do contain palm oil.

275 2018-11-09 23:31:47 yes thought about cocos oil for some reason that might lubricate afflicted tissue
276 2018-11-09 23:31:25 It worked on me. Hadn’t realised the impact of palm oil  Now I try to avoid it wherever possible.

282 2018-11-09 23:30:54 It's no longer the Manchester derby it's Manchester vs oil barons FC . Hope we do the cunts #MUFC @ManUtd
283 2018-11-09 23:30:46 Mix 4 cups coffee with 2 1/2 pints ginger. Mix in Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve with salmon
284 2018-11-09 23:30:45 That's a really good point but a terrible analogy that doesn't fit the point at all.

Better analogy:

Suing oil companies is like suing builders of single family homes rather than the cities (like Berkeley) that have apartment bans.

It's the cities that force us into bad design
285 2018-11-09 23:30:43 Yes. Try adding a few drops of coconut oil.
286 2018-11-09 23:30:36 Their stand is an extremely important one.  I'll do my best to make sure we don't buy any products with palm oil.
287 2018-11-09 23:30:23 Vive la Avolution! Make the switch to @ChosenFoods 's cooking oils, spray, and spreads. Made from non-GMO avocado oil. PLUS save 50% when you spend more than $10 with code MOTHERRUNNER
288 2018-11-09 23:30:23 Cadet NCO tells Cadet A to ready weapon for oiling while oil bottle is with Cadet B. Cadet A given oil bottle, uses it, and proceeds to fire off the action right next to Cadet B's ear (thankfully a blank, but no blank firing attachment, because the rifles were the old cadet GP).
289 2018-11-09 23:30:22 Exactly, the 50s in Iran, Arthur  when 
USA/CIA/allies deposed the elected leader & put in the Shah, so we could control their oil.. 
We need to be smarter with what we break..
290 2018-11-09 23:30:20 ...food, bacteria, fungi, oil secreted by glands, hormones, toxins, water, antibodies, sweat, dust, hair, physical contact, blood, sun, comedowns... just have to balance all that like a DJ. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose the battle
291 2018-11-09 23:30:16 Just a bunch of shit i threw in. Eggs, onions , green onions, seasoning salt, peppers with a bit of oil
292 2018-11-09 23:30:13 I don’t care either way tbh. I was horrified when I saw the palm oil plantations. You cannot imagine the scale of it until you see it.
293 2018-11-09 23:30:11 Up next is Cup Quals for Sunday’s Cam Am 500 at 7 pm ET then the Lucas Oil 150 Trucks Series Race at 8:30 pm ET on FS1
294 2018-11-09 23:29:55 Ororo yato si crude oil!
Te dem
295 2018-11-09 23:29:45 
296 2018-11-09 23:29:43 Idk if you use essential oils for anything, but smelling peppermint oil can keep you alert. Peppermint tea has the same effect.
297 2018-11-09 23:29:42 peppermint oil really is that girl
298 2018-11-09 23:29:38 Trucks Lucas Oil 150 Lineup: 18,24,51,52,16,41,8,19,88,4,46,98,25,21,17,2,13,54,99,02,20,22,87,15,3,38,45,33,83,49,10,63 #NASCARPlayoffs
299 2018-11-09 23:29:27 Mate see the sea, it makes up for maist ae the Air generated planet-wide. So if these companies are gny start fracking under water, plus the Oil industries. Then the Corals will die aff & we'll be fucked.
300 2018-11-09 23:29:14 Basically just oil, then add the essentials tomatoes, onions, green onions, peppers, seasoning, sliced hot dogs, and then let them fry for a tiny bit before adding the eggs
301 2018-11-09 23:29:08 
Use anointing oil too ooo
302 2018-11-09 23:29:07 Anti palm oil Malaysians unite!!!!
303 2018-11-09 23:29:03 Looks like you're the only one who cares. The rest of us appear to be concerned about the main issue, unsustainable palm oil. Well done @IcelandFoods
304 2018-11-09 23:28:58 Sir ji @arunjaitley kitna paisa chahiye aapko

Oil tax - you got 10 lakh cr in 4 years
GST - you got 1 lakh cr in 1 year
Aadhar savings - 90k cr in 1 year

Then also you want RBI to give you 3 Lakh cr

Ab bas kariye.
305 2018-11-09 23:28:44 I just referenced Indonesia because they are the biggest palm oil producing nation, which I expect we want to have a free trade agreement in place to buy. But we wouldn't ban an advert on sugar just because we want to trade with the US and buy coke.
306 2018-11-09 23:28:36 I don’t understanding why the #IcelandAdvert is banned and Palm Oil isn’t banned??  Am I missing something??
307 2018-11-09 23:28:30 My skin cracks/peels so I use an oil cleanser and that’s helped a ton! I use Bobbi Brown Soothing Cleansing Oil but I’m sure they have a few different options!
308 2018-11-09 23:28:28 Sodium Lauryl Sulphate is palm oil. It’s in loads of shampoos, shower gels, liquid soaps, etc. Do not buy these tainted products. There are alternatives.
309 2018-11-09 23:28:20 Il y a bien eu un peak oil US en 71. Une récession occidentale s'en ait suivi.
On estime vers 2005 le peak oil conventionnel mondial.
Le prix du pétrole est un TRES mauvais indicateur, son prix ne dépend pas des volumes extraits/consommés et est très peu influencés par les EROI.
310 2018-11-09 23:28:18 Wait! What? Are you trying to say that Norways oil never came from the North Sea? 
Trillions of $ worth still there mate, not to mention the fields that haven't even begun exploration!
311 2018-11-09 23:28:10 So I assume you're banning all the adverts the essentially promote the use of palm oil as they too support a political view?!
312 2018-11-09 23:28:04 Not that I'm defending eating meat, but given many people do choose to eat meat - specific meats (pig, chicken, cow etc), there are no vegan alternatives. Whereas there are to palm oil, because it can be substituted. Few people go out to buy food with palm oil specifically.
313 2018-11-09 23:28:01 I am OUTRAGED that this ad has been banned and have told Clearcast and Ofcom in no uncertain terms!Just because Greenpeace helped make it and its on their website even though it advertises Iceland banning palm oil!!Iceland should be able to advertise this and be APPLAUDED for it!
314 2018-11-09 23:27:59 flavored ? bc the original tastes like castor oil
315 2018-11-09 23:27:51 I need a room full of salt lamps, oil diffusers, meditation music and yoga mats.
316 2018-11-09 23:27:29 Good for you, both for making and sharing this add and also for saying no to palm oil. We don't use any palm oil in our yummy vegan and glutenfree bars... Give us a shout if you'd like some in your stores  X
317 2018-11-09 23:27:27 "Maintenance" would include things like regular oil changes and tire rotations/replacements to keep your car in working condition, which costs money, a cost you don't necessarily control
318 2018-11-09 23:27:16 Great job by @StewartFriesen he’ll roll off in outside row 2 ! Top qualifying  @NoahGragson will lead them all to green in the Lucas Oil 150 tonight at 8pm @FS1
319 2018-11-09 23:27:12 Steyer, Soros and Buffet financed it, with Trudeau and Butts silently cheer leading. Remember these financiers of the court case own most of the tanker cars in NA. Trudeau and Butts are both on record as wanting an oil free economy. And they willingly take Soros $ for 2019.

320 2018-11-09 23:27:11 When you can't get past the child lock on the baby oil....sexiness off the charts!
321 2018-11-09 23:27:10 Can't help but wonder had Iceland come up with their own creative/story for the message, would it have been approved?

They're allowed to showcase upcoming palm-oil-related advertisements on TV.

325 2018-11-09 23:26:50 If you leave the cap on the olive oil jar, you’re doing it wrong.
326 2018-11-09 23:26:27 .@NoahGragson wins the pole for tonight’s Lucas Oil 150 (8:30 pm ET/FS1/MRN/SiriusXM NASCAR Radio)
327 2018-11-09 23:26:27 I'm probably gonna have sweet dreams of #antifa shit bags showing up at my house with sticks trying to break in my front door and the bride unloading the skunk oil from the super soakers on them...works good into their transport via baloons too? I hate daylight savings time! 
328 2018-11-09 23:26:01 not in my opinion. why would the market chop around? you have BREXIT lingereing, oil on new lows, apple down, fb losing ground, Trump is the volatility, the dollar rallying, bond yields rising.. um.. chop around.. I don't think so but our differing opinions ensure it won't chop
329 2018-11-09 23:25:39 C'est n'importe quoi, on a prédit qu'il y aurait un peak oil dans les années 70-80, puis les années 90 etc... Et il ne faut pas compter uniquement sur les EROI mais aussi le prix du pétrole qui indique si c'est rentable ou pas de puiser ou d'améliorer les systèmes d'extractions.
330 2018-11-09 23:25:27 We did this. With our love of money, oil, power and lack of respect of the planet. I found the words easily .
331 2018-11-09 23:25:26 As long as it raises awareness, good. Who cares if Iceland Foods benefit too? They have a business after all.
Use only sustainable palm oil.
332 2018-11-09 23:25:25 How did I go from only needing an oil change to needing two new tires and a wheel alignment...
333 2018-11-09 23:25:12 Solar panel won't work. 24hr darkness. Blizzard cold will ice up and freeze turbine. Sorry no coal or oil. Put on several layers of long johns and have group hugs.
334 2018-11-09 23:24:57 つり革に変身している...
335 2018-11-09 23:24:33 ありがとうございます
この雰囲気以上のモノを直接的に何も参考にせず作り上げた当時のハチさんに脱帽です…
336 2018-11-09 23:24:32 apparently ive never gotten an oil change after dark before bc i just looked up and saw my own car reflected in the pull down door thing and scared the absolute shit out of myself
337 2018-11-09 23:24:32 Dislocation, or extinction? I know, it has been going on for years and the companies keep making promises, while the political leaders twiddle their thumbs. I am quite sure there is an alternative to palm oil and we can all live without it? Good idea for a similar ad!
338 2018-11-09 23:24:27 Brilliant ad. Well done Iceland. I despair of this country, maybe Treeza's got money in palm oil. The lack of care or awareness we see from our politicians defies belief.
339 2018-11-09 23:24:24 TWAX are BACK!!! Top shelf flower rolled into .5g joints, dipped in oil then rolled in that kiefy goodness! Come treat yo self!
340 2018-11-09 23:24:20 Oil is dark and evil... like them... all one and the same I believe
341 2018-11-09 23:24:02 The banning has been fantastic for bringing attention to your shop as well as the palm oil issue. I’d normally not dream of going in my local Iceland, but am now sorely tempted
342 2018-11-09 23:23:51 Hahahhaha you know that when the entire pallet is dry you can peal the whole thing off and start over again. It makes an oil paint frisbee!
343 2018-11-09 23:23:47 NO WAY. you are soooo skilled omg oil painting is one of my weaknesses and your art is so!!! good!!! your merch is to die for djfjjesj now if only shipping wasn't so expensive huhu
344 2018-11-09 23:23:40 You knew that repurposing this Greenpeace vid would be great advertising when it got it's ban - not due to content but because it was made by a political organisation as you are well aware. Why the pretence? Your stand against palm oil is GOOD. The ad is GOOD. This is silly.
345 2018-11-09 23:23:36 I think it's a reference to what could have been. No denying we've been royally humped over old and gas revenues. I've already said, we should be concentrating on Green energy and if anyone wants to drill for oil then pay us to do so. And pay through the fecking nose.
346 2018-11-09 23:23:32 Oil is down for the last ten days...longest streak in 34 years. If you have energy stocks, I would evaluate if they still meet your objectives. If you don’t own them, time to look for a long term buying opportunity. #money #investments
347 2018-11-09 23:23:30 You are absolutely wrong. The oil and gas is used to build absolutely everything. Not just vehicle fuel. 
Build more pipelines. !
348 2018-11-09 23:23:16 Accusation of cheating is serious allegation. Big difference between cheating and a mechanical failure resulting in a low oil level. Very poor form from all concerned ...
349 2018-11-09 23:23:01 We need to start transporting oil by air.
350 2018-11-09 23:23:00 I would loveeeee an oil/nic salt combo some crazy shit like that. But and oil pod nonetheless is the shit yo! I support.
351 2018-11-09 23:22:51 i’ve dreamt mostly in like video game format... idk if that makes sense. Also once in claymation and twice in like oil painting... idk i’m just quirky 
352 2018-11-09 23:22:50 Not too many oil rich nations have as many food banks.....Tories are robbing the people blind!
353 2018-11-09 23:22:36 New tires , oil change, new wipers and whatever else bill I had due.... where’s the Remy 
354 2018-11-09 23:22:22 Good on Iceland for taking a stand against palm oil but Rang-Tang is actually a @GreenpeaceUK campaign...
355 2018-11-09 23:22:16 If some huge cooperations or Malaysia gov are involved in this anti palm oil ban im ashamed to be a Malaysian
356 2018-11-09 23:22:14 Za a fake da guzuma a harbi karsana ke nan. Ayi dai don Allah...
357 2018-11-09 23:22:11 She is also the only country where west exports oil for sub-$20 and east imports for over $70.
358 2018-11-09 23:22:10 One thing sure about oil is that reports of how much / how little is dependent on the needs of WM and unionists.
359 2018-11-09 23:22:04 Transfer to slowly pour in the oven to a further 20 seconds or two days and add this is hot oil.
360 2018-11-09 23:21:51 Les projections du Club de Rome sont toujours pertinentes et conformes à la réalité.
Quand au peak oil conventionnel, il a bien eu lieu, et les EROI ne cessent de baisser depuis.
361 2018-11-09 23:21:49 Actually China is the major oil importer. That is one of the main reasons they are moving away from it.
362 2018-11-09 23:21:42 One of the cheapest places to buy food banning palm oil proves it's possible at any price point
363 2018-11-09 23:21:35 @Clearcast with all due respect,you are missing the point.Just because it has been made in coop with and is on Greenpeace's website shouldn't be enough to ban it. It is ADVERTISING Iceland's ban of palm oil which SHOULD be ADVERTISED and APPLAUDED.Greenpeace is not even mentioned
364 2018-11-09 23:21:23 It's too bad, because I loved him when he was the lead singer of Midnight Oil.  Oh.  Not the same guy.  Sorry.
365 2018-11-09 23:21:17 Honestly medical marijuana is amazing. My cousins aunt was diagnosed w cancer & given a few months to live, she started using medical marijuana & cbd oil after her diagnosis. Its been almost two years... some tumors completely disappeared, the one causing the most problems shrunk
366 2018-11-09 23:21:08 I stay losing that coconut oil lipgloss 
367 2018-11-09 23:21:07 @realDonaldTrump Let's treat Europe like China can buy Iranian oil without any penalty! In fact Europe is seen as a vassal and not an ally! 
368 2018-11-09 23:20:54 J'ai ajouté une vidéo à une playlist @YouTube - Dabur Amla Kids Hair Oil - Adventures of Princess Amira (Arabic)
369 2018-11-09 23:20:47 Who said something about oil bitch you cooking?
370 2018-11-09 23:20:47 Does anyone else think Rick Scott looks like a crazy q-tip?? Or like that guy from Midnight Oil?
371 2018-11-09 23:20:45 ALONE BURN ON YOUR SHOULDER FRACTURING DISASTER FLEABITTEN YOUNG BLOOD NOTHING DELICIOUS OIL POOL AWAY 1 EXIT 99¢ BE BEEF
372 2018-11-09 23:20:44 No cause your country is sometimes looking for oil like in Irak when they lie about massive weapon you remember ?
373 2018-11-09 23:20:31 Honey & coconut mask

- 1 tablespoon of Coconut Oil 
- 1 tablespoon of honey

DIRECTIONS:
1. Mix all ingredients into a bowl
2. Transfer mix into a pot and heat up until melted
3. Apply to hair from top to bottom and cover with a shower cap
4. Let it sit for 15-20 mins

374 2018-11-09 23:20:03 Sweet friendships refresh the soul and awaken our hearts with joy, for good friends are like the anointing oil that yields the fragrant incense of God’s presence.

Prv 27:9
375 2018-11-09 23:19:58 We should all get together to surport @IcelandFoods for their advert to be shown.  Iceland I back you all the way and thank you for surporting local schools in their bid also to change the world regarding palm oil.
376 2018-11-09 23:19:38 @doniveson Hey Don!  is the oil Derrick at gateway park being taken down?
377 2018-11-09 23:19:38 Downside 9 in oil, upside 9 in es. Wonder if that has even happened before? Can’t see them both reversing.
378 2018-11-09 23:19:37 Easy gate is no waiting right now.
379 2018-11-09 23:19:36 Thats it , Iam sick of wasting gas & doing oil changes
380 2018-11-09 23:19:35 Pretty dang delicious! Will have to add fat in the next batch, to pop up the flavor, probably coconut oil.
381 2018-11-09 23:19:24 Suing oil companies is like suing farmers who grow tobacco. It's not the product as much as the delivery system.
382 2018-11-09 23:19:24 Agreed. My understanding (and I could be wrong) is that the only reason palm oil is used in most cases is because it is cheap, not because alternatives don't exist.
383 2018-11-09 23:19:15 Happy days. One afternoon left of the 13 weeks. I'll stay an extra week just to get a chance to say Water displacement oil 
384 2018-11-09 23:19:14 I need to start carrying around a tub of coconut oil
385 2018-11-09 23:19:13 Depuis le Club de Rome, les prévisions se sont toujours plantés, le peak oil a été sans arrêt repoussé, bref plantage sur plantage. Si il ne doit plus avoir de pétrole cela se répercutera sur le prix et on trouvera une alternative comme nous avons toujours fait.
386 2018-11-09 23:19:13 lrt: reason why I take 5 minutes while shopping to see if the stuff I buy contains palm oil.
387 2018-11-09 23:19:12 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
388 2018-11-09 23:18:59 Palm oil is in literally everything how are you supposed to stop purchasing these products without it costing an absolute fortune? Most people are living on a budget as it is.
389 2018-11-09 23:18:58 bagus. kulit aku kering, setelah pake teratur kulit aku jadi lembab perlahan gitu. terus, pori-pori aku disekitar hidung juga sedikit mengecil. worth the price kok toner ini. kalau kamu pake sebelum pake face oil, itu nanti oilnya menyerap cepat banget
390 2018-11-09 23:18:56 So, does this mean all you have to do send in a flock of oil tankers to take out Norway's navy?
391 2018-11-09 23:18:52 do you guys tip your oil change mechanics???
392 2018-11-09 23:18:42 She will clean up even more nicely, have just wiped her down with some sewing machine oil and lubed all her points, and she's as smooth as silk and very quiet for a VS machine.

I love the way she threads up... i wonder how long it has been since she made a stitch ?
393 2018-11-09 23:18:37 They will ban all that on their quest for more $ from legalizing pot , 
Not a fan of legalization ( we do need hemp oil for medical reasons, the other stuff will create big problems), but Uncle Sam needs the Tax $$
But I will admit I own stocks in the pot field
394 2018-11-09 23:18:33 It’s very clever marketing. They knew that amending the Greenpeace animation would see it banned from TV. It a 2 pronged approach, getting the palm oil message across whilst seeing viewings soar across social media. Millions have seen the advert already and it’s only 9th Nov.
395 2018-11-09 23:18:33 Forgot my wallet and got ID'd at the cannabis store...just wanted CBD oil for my old achy body, kid, gimme a break here
396 2018-11-09 23:18:29 @Clearcast we do not understand why you have banned this advert from being shown. Surely raising awareness of deforestation and the overuse of palm oil is vital & what  better way of doing it than at Christmas! Let’s overturn the ban and show @IcelandFoods advert this #Christmas
397 2018-11-09 23:18:26 Avocado Mask  

You Will Need:
-1 Ripe Medium Sized Avocado
-2 tbsp Coconut Oil
-Shower Cap

1. Mash the avocado 
2. Add in the coconut oil 
3. Mix well
4. Apply to hair and scalp
5. Wash off with cold water
398 2018-11-09 23:18:25 قبلیش خیلی بهتر بود
399 2018-11-09 23:18:24 Quítale “Periodismo” y déjalo en “manipulación”.
400 2018-11-09 23:18:16 Oh wow interesting, so why is palm oil always the demonised one ?
401 2018-11-09 23:17:51 I had cancer in my tummy and with treatment I used Frankincense oil on my tummy and in my oil burner and the dr told me I healed the fastest he has ever seen he told me it was to do with the Frankincense I never got sick throw the treatment as well
402 2018-11-09 23:17:42 My head smells like a sandwich rn. Its kinda gross  I made a mayo + avocado oil + egg mix to help comb through my hair. It is so knotted and matted 
403 2018-11-09 23:17:35 Saskatoon gets it right back. 6-1
404 2018-11-09 23:17:25 ughh i wish i was an oil heiress
405 2018-11-09 23:17:19 Rub me down in baby oil
406 2018-11-09 23:17:15 to be fair, casey did the steaks, and the broccoli is just steamed with some butter drizzled on top! and the sprouts we just toss in a ziplock with some oil and garlic and whatever else is in the spice rack and throw in the toaster oven!
407 2018-11-09 23:17:00 #alexanderbruz
Heading to the great state of Texas! Under republican leadership and mostly thanks to #realDonaldTrump, They are the worlds third largest producer of oil: 1. USA 2. Russia 3. Texas 4. Obama’s favorite country, Iran God bless Texas!
408 2018-11-09 23:16:55 Aye probably the most risky procedure in the fossil fuel industry. Ye get spills underwater, & its the fish & corals that get damaged. but we dnt even control ooe ain waters. The Gov take kickbacks fae the Oil firms, & let them get on wae it. Billions of £'s chucked at the UK.

410 2018-11-09 23:16:38 Have you tried cbd oil ? Speaking to someone who is a big dog person and she says she has heard a lot of good reports from dog owners
411 2018-11-09 23:16:37 Absolutely, if they're getting the advice for free! I do not want my money going to American "environmental" think tanks funded by US big oil, with a mandate to displace and shut down Canadian resource development.
412 2018-11-09 23:16:36 It isn't the rape of the forest that is political, it is the cost of goods and trade which is political, which this advert does not touch on. The rape of the forest is fact, if they wen't on to say "we don't do anything because we want cheap oil" than I would back down, they dont
413 2018-11-09 23:16:25 Probably palm oil. 
#IcelandAdvert
414 2018-11-09 23:16:13 those who don’t understand why the Iceland ad was political??? like anything palm oil related like that is clearly made to increase pressure on policy??? like that is the point of Greenpeace???
415 2018-11-09 23:16:06 Mix a little bit of castor oil with conditioner put it on wet hair and let it air dry. It's a game changer

418 2018-11-09 23:15:57 I eat kale, too! You have to massage it with salt and olive oil. Pull out the spines (on lacinato) Then it’s phenomenal. Also, hey, Ian!
419 2018-11-09 23:15:51 Not a surprise, they behead people, hang teens, treat women worse than dogs...these oil rich barbarians are the scourge of the earth and it is beyond pathetic this country has been in bed with them for decades. Trump complicity with bailout loans for his businesses disgusting.

425 2018-11-09 23:15:31 @Clearcast I do not understand why you have banned this advert from being shown. Surely raising awareness of deforestation and the overuse of palm oil is vital and what a better way of doing it than at Christmas! Let’s overturn the ban and show @IcelandFoods advert.

426 2018-11-09 23:15:30 George Friedman argues the US strategy is quite clever.  Russia must sell raw materials and oil.  China must export manufactured goods.  The former is being frustrated by low energy prices; the latter by tariffs. Neither China nor Russia can help the other out of the jam.
427 2018-11-09 23:15:30 Well there's other cool thing called a "wall"
Long, long ago, people would build walls wide enough that you could stand on them and tall enough that people outside couldn't reach

Guards would stand on these "walls" and throw things, shoot arrows, dump big vats of boiling oil ect

431 2018-11-09 23:14:42 Canada should be talking about tariffs on foreign oil imports into the country. 

We need to discourage imports and support Canadian production.

It seems the only way we are going to be able to do that is through de-incentives people at the pump.

435 2018-11-09 23:14:05 I had a trade school fix some leaks on my truck. Sent it back because a leak happened again......the oil filter backed off. I feel like an idiot for not catching that before sending that back

439 2018-11-09 23:13:16 My issue isn’t so much with what Iceland are doing, but with the message they’re spreading. One animals life is worth saving but another’s isn’t. As much as we need to campaign for ethical, sustainable palm oil (because I believe a total boycott brings it’s own issues) (1/2)
440 2018-11-09 23:13:14 Coconut oil removes waterproof mascara better than any “waterproof” makeup remover I’ve used. It doesn’t rip out my eyelashes. And also I have super oily skin but I think bc I use coconut oil my skin doesn’t produce as much oil as before.
441 2018-11-09 23:13:07 I love it!! I make some mean asparagus. Olive oil, salt and pepper is the best!!

444 2018-11-09 23:12:25 If you agree that palm oil is not vegan then it makes no sense to criticize this ad, which is 100% correct and brilliant.
445 2018-11-09 23:12:22 Good oil & I feel magnificent
446 2018-11-09 23:12:15 Just had MOST AMAZING meal at The Ship Pub “Plenty’O”Fish” cooked by master cooker Karen. Incredibly beautiful, so very very good.

448 2018-11-09 23:12:10 Strange that the actual production cost of crude oil is so low its crazy... The benchmark price is made up of taxes and stakeholders dividends and salaries.. Offshore oil in Nigeria costs about 1.25 a bbl to produce
449 2018-11-09 23:12:09 @beardbrand Got my first order in yesterday and I want to say: top notch packaging, bottles, fun gift, etc. I've only used the oil so far and it's quality, I know I'll love it all. But the SCENTS... just wow, so good. I want all the things. Gf approved. Can't pick fave!
450 2018-11-09 23:11:46 I also agree oil and energy Independence is integral to our national security this is a national security issue
451 2018-11-09 23:11:39 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
452 2018-11-09 23:11:35 Kind of pointless though since Vene is an oil dictatorship which means they’re a stable dictatorship (at minimum).
453 2018-11-09 23:11:31 Election coming soon.  There were ZERO urgencies in getting our oil to market before. Your cabinet is filled with Anti oil.
454 2018-11-09 23:11:22 Sorry, misconstrued the 97% that is solely the Amazon as the entirety. I do acknowledge palm oil's toll, I just advocate for the largest problem first. Thank you for enlightening me, I'm gonna go read those now.
455 2018-11-09 23:11:10 Why is that banned? We need that sort of message shown to a wider audience. I always look out for palm oil products but it’s often hidden under other names.
456 2018-11-09 23:11:09 This is such BS, how come you don’t report the trains that derail and explode with oil and have to burn into the air until it’s gone? I have decided that all of y’all that are against Donald Trump Are liars! Why am I saying this? Seriously,why am I saying this,,cause u always lie
457 2018-11-09 23:11:06 Wildly diverse. Jack Travis has some great wares. From this lovely antique oil painting to a vintage crocodile purse. See Jack in the Gymnasium this Saturday and Sunday from 10am to 5pm.
458 2018-11-09 23:11:02 oil & gas is subsidized heavily through the tax code. got so brazen a few years back the law was finally changed to restrict the oil-depletion allowance to small producers. the expensing of intangible drilling costs remains in the tax code
459 2018-11-09 23:10:56 Thanks 
Pain free is a good sign

I’m gonna try crackers & water. Maybe drive to another state tomorrow to get some CBD oil.
460 2018-11-09 23:10:56 i came to get an oil change & it smells hella loud here they better not fuck my oil up cause bitch i’ll sue
461 2018-11-09 23:10:53 Surely we can produce something else like coconut oil instead of palm oil? Why be so selfish and only think about our economy when we are actually ruining the whole ecosystem, apatah lagi forcing out precious orangutan to go extinct

470 2018-11-09 23:09:44 It's not 97%, it's big but not even close. And palm oil is a major driver of deforestation. If you want to teach, first you gotta learn. Groups like FERN, WRM or GFC, for instance, produce great reports on forests, you can start by reading their webpages.
471 2018-11-09 23:09:36 Gaslighting...a term first used to refer to the idea that the fuel from the oil lamps in London were driving people crazy....later used as a term to refer to someone being driven insane purposely through another's actions

Or something like that
472 2018-11-09 23:09:28 It will pursue you, you've never poured oil on and when you weaving, my dear! What have you in pursuit anew.
473 2018-11-09 23:09:14 @simpleskin can you tell me if you have discontinued your oil balancing moisturiser? Finished my last tube and hunting everywhere for it. Thanks
474 2018-11-09 23:08:59 Well, at least we know that everything bad is happening in Badistan now...oh wait...where is Badistan again?  Gotta get those humanitarian bombs there quick so they can get the oil out and save the children 
475 2018-11-09 23:08:57 Maybe they have shares in palm oil?!
476 2018-11-09 23:08:51 The easy way to tell if Iceland's "palm oil" ad has been banned or not is whether you've been able to watch it.  And you have.
477 2018-11-09 23:08:30 I also don’t remember too many people showing an interest when Iceland announced it’s commitment to remove palm oil from products back in April. Or anyone boycotting other supermarkets that still use palm oil. It’s just another case of ‘all aboard the outrage train’.
478 2018-11-09 23:08:30 It's about PALM OIL, which they are trying to not have in their food for environmental reasons. PALM OIL - what is wrong with that?
479 2018-11-09 23:08:13 ほんとさらちゃんの絵好きだ
480 2018-11-09 23:08:12 i thought he was pouring oil on scump... then... well... you know
481 2018-11-09 23:07:57 Well I'd be hoping to see more investment in Green energy than oil drilling or fracking etc. The tech for solar panels is going to negate them soon enough anyway and wind and wave energy will also improve no end. Couldn't give a feck about the rest of Britain, go Green Escocia
482 2018-11-09 23:07:39 Iceland have stopped using unethical palm oil in their own brand products. However, they still sell other brands with unethical palm oil, suggesting they aren't really that fussed
483 2018-11-09 23:07:30 Wait I thought the air was “too clean” for optimal health and we need more fracking and oil refineries near our homes and school for a better quality of life /s haha
484 2018-11-09 23:07:08 Oil/gas
485 2018-11-09 23:07:07 You are not wrong in saying I should advocate for both, or treat palm oil as being just as unvegan as meat. This just comes off the same to me as the plastic straw movement, meanwhile 46% of the ocean's plastic is fishing nets.
486 2018-11-09 23:06:53 I heard on NBR yesterday that the Saudis may split off from OPEC and partner up with Russia. Two big oil producers.
487 2018-11-09 23:06:50 More pain to come. New housing starts down (people aren't buying appliances), oil down (no one putting up new wind farms), global slowdown (no one building new airplanes). Bear put crew will see 7s.

498 2018-11-09 23:05:08 This week heard of an absolutely abhorrent side issue to the harvest of Palm oil. Female Orangutans shaved, chained to beds with lipstick and used for sex for the labour from the camps.
499 2018-11-09 23:05:01 It's called funding. It doesn't become collusion just because the other side has financial backing. And it's a drop in the bucket compared to the billions spent on disinformation and corruption by the oil and coal lobbies.

502 2018-11-09 23:04:44 Great campaign. In new year will you do the same for anti-sugar? It's a serious question as palm oil plus refined sugar really does equate to obesity and human health s devastated too...

508 2018-11-09 23:04:14 I agree that steps towards a more compassionate lifestyle is better than nothing at all. But singling out palm oil is speciesism. People focus on palm oil because it’s brought forward by the media. Is anyone talking about koala decline because of deforestation for animal agric?

515 2018-11-09 23:03:31 As if gas prices are dependent on minimium wage and not on oil prices. Stupid ass tweet. Gas was like 4.50 years ago when our minimum wage was still $9
516 2018-11-09 23:03:24 Why would you ban the new Iceland ad, showing how rainforests are being destroyed to get palm oil, meaning that the wildlife dies too? Why is everything being wrapped in cotton candy and rainbow at all times; to make it easier for us to swallow?
517 2018-11-09 23:03:09 There are many battles which need fighting and Palm Oil is a huge one. Iceland was the first supermarket to commit to removing plastic from all own brand products. We should not be slaming this effort. This is an environmental issue and everyone should support it. Vegan or not.
518 2018-11-09 23:03:00 So apparently the mouth piece of my cartridge somehow I screwed and just about all the oil leaked out 
519 2018-11-09 23:02:56 Lol. Do research bros.
520 2018-11-09 23:02:40 They're both bad, but I think we should focus on the bigger cause of the issue this ad is advertising, deforestation, which 97% of can be linked to animal ag. Palm oil is bad, animal ag is worse, and if I want people to learn something, it should be about the bigger problem.

531 2018-11-09 23:01:21 This an important message for sure. However, Iceland knew this as would never be cleared for broadcast. They were never going to pay for a 90 second Xmas slot. They manufactured outrage and we are all being played. They still stock unethical palm oil products.
532 2018-11-09 23:01:04 Got my oil changed for 20$ today because I asked and said I normally come to the same place. Lol 
533 2018-11-09 23:01:00 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
534 2018-11-09 23:00:55 A 10-year analysis of the correlation between the $CAD (vs $USD) and oil prices show that 78% positive relationship. A large part of Canada’s US dollar income comes from the sale of energy-based goods to the rest of the world and to the USA in particular, just like $RSX - Russian
535 2018-11-09 23:00:54 I hope you make this the subject of your next @guardianeco article @GeorgeMonbiot. How is it okay for companies to promote products which contain palm oil but not okay to show the impacts of palm oil production. If it's too political then surely Unicef's Ads should be banned.
536 2018-11-09 23:00:47 I assume you don't know how mullahs made europe support them.
Our car industry is completely under control of France.
Our chemical industry is under control of France and Germany.
Our oil industry is under control of France and Britain.
and this list can have many other examples.

546 2018-11-09 22:59:55 Parents visited first and second grade students this week and taught the them about the celebration of Diwali or “Festival of Lights”. Students enjoyed learning about the Hindu celebration and making diyas (small oil lamps).

548 2018-11-09 22:59:49 olive oil is delicious, just not so much as a cooking oil in many scenarios
549 2018-11-09 22:59:30 Girl try my CBD oil or bath bombs! it’s completely THC free! Nurses are actually always buying stuff for this reason!!
550 2018-11-09 22:59:29 Now if V had been there and she was making oil rubbing comments and kept getting overexcited and she knew it was making V uncomfortable, I'd be saying something different. Cause that affects their relationship.
551 2018-11-09 22:59:29 They got this in a beard oil too and lotion lol I guess this what they really meant by legalizing marijuana
552 2018-11-09 22:59:23 @Clearcast why you have banned this advert from being shown. Surely raising awareness of deforestation and the overuse of palm oil is vital and what a better way of doing it than at Christmas! Let’s overturn the ban and show @IcelandFoods advert this #Christmas
553 2018-11-09 22:59:16 お守りも語呂合わせも嫌いだけどー
554 2018-11-09 22:59:10 RT @MMLopezC: Damn another week went by without me getting an oil change.. this is getting out of control 
555 2018-11-09 22:59:08 Did you notice most of the leaky oil pipelines to china have been canceled?
556 2018-11-09 22:59:05 Clearcast who’s MD is public school Cambridge uni worked at BBC and Sky and probably has chums who manufacture palm oil down his club
557 2018-11-09 22:59:04 I am now anti Palm oil.

562 2018-11-09 22:58:34 it’s like concentrated cannabis oil
563 2018-11-09 22:58:29 Well Midterms are over, so now Trump and brush off SA. His objective of ensuring oil prices don’t skyrocket by forcing SA to raise production was achieved.
564 2018-11-09 22:58:28 We have been fighting alongside the US in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. And why? Because America likes oil.
565 2018-11-09 22:58:11 I like Homer Simpsone

569 2018-11-09 22:57:49 Extra virgin or refined olive oil? Extra virgin has too low a smoke/flash point for my tastes.
570 2018-11-09 22:57:47 Mister Mayor, your concerns about oil companies causing climate change and endangering New Yorkers is clearly legitimate. However, there is a lot you can do to combat climate change in NYC and your own life. How about fixing mass transit, congestion pricing and biking to the gym?
571 2018-11-09 22:57:47 If you call Muslim nations prosperous. Apart from the oil rich, most Muslim nations a plagued with poverty, shitting in a ditch and dysentry. Muslims have fled these countries for years for self preservation, plus more and more Muslims are converting to Christianity!
572 2018-11-09 22:57:45 Nonstick frying pan, so I don’t need oil.
573 2018-11-09 22:57:32 10 years ago i was making fun of a guy who sincerely believed in peak oil on a message board. now the idea of peak oil is hilariously quaint instead of just like a quirk of a weird guy. time flies!
574 2018-11-09 22:57:31 I wanto to go to your place to put oil on his body during the photo shoot

578 2018-11-09 22:57:06 #NoPalmOilChristmas I will be reading labels carefully as I do my food/toiletry shopping, not just for Christmas but all year round. Let's not wait for big companies to take action, when we, the little buyers can just say no to palm oil.

After all, that's what Trump's doing to others.
581 2018-11-09 22:56:26 Definitely had to rack up on some more tea tree soap and castor oil

583 2018-11-09 22:56:18 Uh Oh,...some British rich dudes are 'bout to get Twitterated,...put some popcorn in the microwave,...no Palm Oil,..please,...
584 2018-11-09 22:56:04 You don't think crude oil will visit lower low?
585 2018-11-09 22:56:00 You and your daily SUV caravan trips to the gym are choosing to be the customer of “Big Oil”. You care more about your plush trip to a far-away gym than the planet. 

Why not start by holding yourself accountable?
586 2018-11-09 22:55:59 @AlphaHQ Do your products contain palm oil. I use the balancing cleanser currently which is excellent
587 2018-11-09 22:55:59 And the builds will stop in oil- KSA will direct elsewhere
588 2018-11-09 22:55:58 For homes and institutions like yours really important steps are maximizing insulation, converting oil or gas fired heating to heat pump system(s) and starting to consider EVs so that one can remove all direct reliance on fossil fuels.
589 2018-11-09 22:55:50 It’s one of my favorite things! Some people over think it though. I had an inedible version of it last year at a restaurant. It’s not supposed to have oil or cheese in it. 
590 2018-11-09 22:55:39 I don't think people realise that palm oil production is so harmful.
The advert would have really raised awareness.
Evidently oil producers are happy the way things are...
591 2018-11-09 22:55:37 Aveda's Dry Remedy is perfect for winter for those who have super dry hair and the Aveda Buriti oil too, I never use these since my hair is more normal to dry, for Normal to dry hair like mine Aveda's Cherry Almond is best
592 2018-11-09 22:55:36 We all aren’t successful oil entrepreneurs like you NHD 
593 2018-11-09 22:55:36 Supermarkets will never do that. Iceland have removed palm oil from their own brands which is a start, all supermarkets should do this. But most palm oil in our products is not from a sustained source. So the best way to help is to choose products without palm oil. Difficult that
594 2018-11-09 22:55:35 don’t use heat on your hair, it’s usually what makes your hair so dry and damaged 

castor oil is freaking amazing:)))
from experience using it has                   helped me get long eyeslashes and my hair has grown a lot

don’t brush your hair when it’s wet your hair-
595 2018-11-09 22:55:31 I agree, it’s ridiculous that the mayor is trying to sue major oil companies for climate change when he himself does little to combat it in his own life or in New York City. Maybe fixing the city’s mass transit and congestion pricing are good places to start?
596 2018-11-09 22:55:22 things that don't mix, a comprehensive list:

601 2018-11-09 22:54:49 We don't get the Grace oil here. All our grocery stores and Winners have numerous choices of cold pressed virgin coconut oil. #YYC
602 2018-11-09 22:54:38 olive oil has taste, however canola or sunflower oil is better for cooking. doesnt add a taste and can handle higher temperatures better.
603 2018-11-09 22:54:36 In 1981 BP wanted to start drilling for oil in the Clyde. They said they had done all the science and thete was a huge amount of oil there. Thatcher blocked them because those waters had to be kept clear for subs.
Get rid of the nukes and create oil jobs that make Scotland money
604 2018-11-09 22:54:31 its all about the northeast. theres oil in them thar dunes.
605 2018-11-09 22:54:28 Kuwait Times OPEC Chief Says Members Need To Look Beyond Oil
606 2018-11-09 22:54:28 I'd add the people responsible for palm oil production and inclusion in thousands of food products. Destroying your health and rain forests in one go. And the governing body that banned the Iceland advert. Disgraceful.
607 2018-11-09 22:54:26 And we Europeans got dragged into you're oil wars in the middle east. Europeans have died fighting for America's personal gain. NATO allies have saved American asses in those wars also.

612 2018-11-09 22:54:10 There will be a glut of oil in the next decade, due to the increased popularity of electric vehicles, hybrid cars, efficient appliances and homes.  The trend is less reliance on oil, not more.

616 2018-11-09 22:53:42 it's a bunch of synthetic vitamins our body can't absorb because it's not natural, corn starch solids and a little bit of some low quality fish oil if you're lucky. It's a bunch of empty calories. Sweetened hemp milk (preferably homemade) is way better alternative in my opinion.
617 2018-11-09 22:53:39 We already have conventional gas and oil infrastructure sufficient to fuel a transition to carbon neutral energy sources.
618 2018-11-09 22:53:39 Seems the Iceland Palm Oil ad is not actually “banned” from TV as the press have reported. It just doesn’t pass criteria for an “advert” as it was an existing campaign film produced by Greenpeace. If they paid, they could run it on TV. Just saying.
619 2018-11-09 22:53:36 Try my best to avoid palm oil but it's impossible. So much respect for @IcelandFoods.
620 2018-11-09 22:53:31 But 2 b clear, I'm not 4 open borders. No 1 is. We can't afford our own taxcut. I think we need to get ppl on the ground 2 better assist their issue& not just throw $ 2 their corrupt politicians-or it will not stop desperate ppl.

621 2018-11-09 22:53:19 I won't buy any foods with palm oil in.

636 2018-11-09 22:52:09 No matter what your views are on the message of the Iceland Ad, you can’t deny it’s a beautifully made short film, poetry, superb animation and a punchy narrative.

PS I’d never heard of palm oil, before today. Well played Iceland. 

#IcelandAdvert
#Awareness
637 2018-11-09 22:52:05 Politics aside, #Palm oil is 60% saturated fat, replacing more expensive, healthier oils in too much of our food, even breads, breakfast cerials, 
cakes/ mixes, biscuits, gravy granules, soups,ready meals...i was shocked how many products, more than good for us...#IcelandAdvert

639 2018-11-09 22:51:46 Superb. But what’s the link to @IcelandFoods ? They boycotting palm oil based products?
640 2018-11-09 22:51:41 Fine, but “we are removing” in isolation is meaningless. On its website, Iceland states its policy to remove palm oil by end 2018. Why not say that in the ad, or link to the policy? I would also love to see a shout-out/credit to @Greenpeace and its phenomenal work in this space
641 2018-11-09 22:51:39 I am sorry you had such a bad experience with it. Sounds like you had irresponsible neighbors. CBD oil works wonders for some people. Cannabis in other forms has also been known to help people with seizure conditions. It helps people with appetite loss. The list goes on.
642 2018-11-09 22:51:12 BAN PALM OIL
643 2018-11-09 22:51:06 Yo @Tesco @asda @sainsburys @Morrisons @marksandspencer @coopuk be more like @IcelandFoods and try and stop using palm oil in your own brand products completely. Sustainably farmed or not it’s still v detrimental to many forest habitats and the species that live in them!

649 2018-11-09 22:50:39 Viral Iceland palm oil ad: beautiful, important, needs to be seen

Chances of the marketing dept *not knowing* it was going to get banned and therefore spread so well when they found it (look up backstory): extremely slim?

whatever, it worked, this we should be grateful for

653 2018-11-09 22:50:10 In Malaysia, I met a tribe called the Orang Astli, the original people. They live alongside the Orang Utan, the forest people. We are losing them both to palm oil.
654 2018-11-09 22:49:48 Watched the @IcelandFoods advert today, and my 5 year old wants to adopt/sponsor an orangutan for Christmas- we’re looking into it.

662 2018-11-09 22:49:12 The next time you buy groceries near your house (or buy anything) thank an oil refinery for helping produce it,and getting it there.   The next time you fly in a plane thank a refinery.  Just about everything you do or buy to survive.

674 2018-11-09 22:48:25 Oil is definable better, However some do not like the taste and go for the capsules. Myself personally I am using CBDPure Capsules, easy dosage just swallow a capsule and know exactly what I am getting (exact dose). A lot just comes down to personal preference.

681 2018-11-09 22:47:41 Global Stocks Drop as Oil Extends Declines. Global stocks fell Friday as crude prices continued to lose ground a day after the US oil benchmark entered a bear market & the Federal Reserve Bank signaled a rate increase
S&P 500 the Dow fell 0.6% & 0.4% respectively Nasdaq fell 1%.
682 2018-11-09 22:47:36 should not bee banned, @IcelandFoods  campaign to create a palm oil free world is a cause getting behind. we need to leave a better world for our kids
683 2018-11-09 22:47:28 We need an alignment, the tires need rotated and balanced and we a couple quarts low on oil, but we still trying to get there. NO DOUBT! IT'S ALWAYS #L1C4! #BIRDGANG

684 2018-11-09 22:47:19 If instead of comparing to the usual cliche of defence spending we compare the lifetime cost of ITER to the annual spend on renewables subsidy or oil/gas primary energy R&D it suddenly looks very cheap!!
685 2018-11-09 22:47:13 All this money spent to pump oil to Texas. Why not build a refinery on the Border of Canada. This  is all BS
686 2018-11-09 22:47:12 Maybe you're mixing the real cost with the conflated cost. When you buy ice cream you're paying several tiers of emoyment. Not just Ben and Jerries. Most cheap ice cream is made with oil not cream and milk.
687 2018-11-09 22:47:00 Nobody better be using palm oil on my watch im UPSET
688 2018-11-09 22:46:55 I think it’s also partly how there’s a lot of eucalyptus trees in Cali now, which are basically fire bombs bc they’re full of eucalyptus oil — sorry from Australia
689 2018-11-09 22:46:43 still can’t believe the Iceland advert got banned because it had animals getting taken from their homes and KILLED because we want palm oil. it’s something that society needs to see and prevent.
690 2018-11-09 22:46:31 Yes! When the sky looks like one of those Old Masters oil paintings...love that view 
691 2018-11-09 22:46:29 Pressure by the big companies who use palm oil maybe?
692 2018-11-09 22:46:28 She’ll keep kickin. Those punk ass number are just suggestions. Just don’t push the oil change too far back
693 2018-11-09 22:46:13 I just use grass fed butter these days. I don’t want to worry about if my olive oil was cut/diluted with some other type of crap oil. Plus I like the taste better
694 2018-11-09 22:46:11 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
695 2018-11-09 22:46:06 I use either olive oil or butter and you just continuous stir until it’s thoroughly cooked. Super simple. Add items based on how long they take to finish. FE: add shrimp last cause it cooks dumb fast
696 2018-11-09 22:46:06 3 Month k baad aaj ki price wala oil deliver ho GA.
697 2018-11-09 22:46:05 B Natural moisturizer works well on my skin. I use this  product on my whole body such as my arms, legs, hands, etc. My skin looks fabulous! It feels so soft, smooth, moisturize, and shiny! B natural contains all natural ingredients of Pure beeswax and olive oil.@b_natl
698 2018-11-09 22:46:05 Poverty food that's been keeping me strong: Pasta

When there's no tomato sauce, the investment of butter or olive oil has always ensured I've got something to go on it. Shout out to garlic salt and dried basil flakes
699 2018-11-09 22:45:47 Secondly, Islam would never have been an interest of the West if there was no oil in the desert. This is all about the stealing of resources. Before that, it was the slaughter of Jews by the West. Prior to that? The slave trade by the West. Before that? The Crusades by Christians
700 2018-11-09 22:45:35  it’s not hard when walking outside or playing outside with grass to get fleas. Use tea tree oil shampoo for dogs help, fleas, ticks don’t like tea tree oil.
701 2018-11-09 22:45:32 Gas prices are not going up just because of inflation. Taxes & oil prices also affect them. If gas prices are what you are worried about we need to do more drilling in the US rather than getting it from overseas. This would cause oil prices for us to drop, lowering gas prices.

707 2018-11-09 22:45:09 I want to live in Austria where people pay attention to the truth of climate change and DO something about it, instead of USA where 
Trump and cohorts DENY truth, promote oil drilling, all things anti-climate friendly, and FIX elections to keep themselves in power!
708 2018-11-09 22:45:07 @asda @Tesco @sainsburys @AldiUK @LidlUK please follow in @IcelandFoods footsteps and remove palm oil from your products. The destruction will only end when demand stops. Bravo to Iceland  #icelandadvert #NoPalmOilChristmas
709 2018-11-09 22:45:03 wow, hOw tOxiC
710 2018-11-09 22:45:00 Iraq war was over, he pulled troops out while they were rebuilding, energy independence, so the U.S. isn't buying oil from the middle east, the veteran thing, as well as the school is just not accurate, what else you got
711 2018-11-09 22:44:56 More importantly congratulations to Emma for voicing the story characters and helping to back the Green peace /iceland ad campaign against wrong palm oil harvesting methods.
712 2018-11-09 22:44:54 ‘Sustainable palm oil’ is an oxymoron - demand drives deforestation. Iceland is doing the right thing
713 2018-11-09 22:44:51 Palm oil, Who knew? not me, will check what I buy from now on. Thank you Greenpeace and Iceland.
714 2018-11-09 22:44:49 Do you think the reason the Iceland Xmas add has been banned, is due to pressure by the companies who use palm oil in their products? #IcelandAdvert #PalmOil #NoPalmOilChristmas #savetheorangutans
715 2018-11-09 22:44:44 Just show it---their not the only company selling palm oil products  this is a dig at the working classes what about Harrod's or Waitrose

719 2018-11-09 22:44:27 Wipe the blade with a rough cloth. It's oil build up
720 2018-11-09 22:44:25 Yep, slice leaving a quarter-inch at the bottom to hold it together. The topping is melted butter, olive oil and spices. Then parmesan at the end.
721 2018-11-09 22:44:21 You should actually do some research. The AER does have security on oil sands mines. Furthermore there has been significant remediation where the land has been restored and is pristine and full of wildlife. In fact the oil sands should be thought of as one giant remediation
722 2018-11-09 22:44:16 Economic tips for the next week. Time is Rome fuse.

16:30 US oil inventories
723 2018-11-09 22:44:15 And Spain, don't forget. The sale of arms is under big corruption, previous ministers belonged to one of these companies and the king received commissions per barrel of oil purchased by Spain. The new government has not changed with respect to the genocidal regime of Saudi Arabia
724 2018-11-09 22:44:14 my dad took a 2 week job and literally in his first day he’ll have earnt more than my monthly pay check, uhh someone get me into the oil industry
725 2018-11-09 22:44:03 Proper use of crude oil money, and not stolen and kept by politicians
726 2018-11-09 22:44:01 If you look at it this way, a bag of rice and oil plus salt as you claim is what she cooks every day for a month. Even at that, 30k won't cut it.
727 2018-11-09 22:44:00 Yeah me neither, there’s a 3 option without the oil adapter and you control it with an app on your phone. The 2 is probably sick too though I just haven’t used one
728 2018-11-09 22:43:56 oil your scalp
729 2018-11-09 22:43:37 I agree, it's great of them and more should follow their lead. 

I just wish they'd drawn attention by putting out an actual advert rather than manufacturing internet outrage. Palm oil is a massive issue and brands shouldn't have to resort to this weird subterfuge.
730 2018-11-09 22:43:34 Maybe it isnt palm tree coconut oil but a synthetic grease chemistry with fossil fuel
731 2018-11-09 22:43:27 The only thing I’ve been putting in my hair is coconut oil I don’t wanna put not heat on it and flexi rods
732 2018-11-09 22:43:22 Coconut oil is high in lauric acid and a naturally antiviral, antibacterial & antifungal food. Add 1-2 Tbsp. to your daily Green Smoothie!
733 2018-11-09 22:43:20 No used lug nuts here, just fresh oil and corn dogs lol. May I Bayou a tiger bait corndog?
734 2018-11-09 22:43:17 I feel that I still can't process how oil company's either don't understand or choose not to understand the importance of preserving the Amazon. How do you not see or choose to not see the bigger picture? And for such materialistic, shallow interests.

736 2018-11-09 22:43:15 The same oil money that builds refineries in low income areas causing childhood diesases that the parents who work at the refineries have to pay for, but can't afford too cuz they don't make enough. Yea, its lit .
737 2018-11-09 22:43:07 I use warm water with mine and that really helps them remove the makeup, but its definitely not for everyone. It took me a while to find a balm/oil cleanser I liked and I'm often too lazy to double cleanse
738 2018-11-09 22:43:04 I'm going to let the baby oil comment slide... literally. Cause it's not like she said it suggestively exactly.
739 2018-11-09 22:43:00 @IcelandFoods I’ve noticed some of your products still contain palm oil. Is this still something you’re working on?
740 2018-11-09 22:42:42 Clove oil will help numb your gums so you won’t feel as much pain during the process.

742 2018-11-09 22:42:23 @purekanapremium I’m interested in your products. People seem to love a dose before bed and or before they start there day. I’ve never used cbd oil in my life. What would be the best suggestion on when to take my first few doses?
743 2018-11-09 22:42:21 Good luck, looks like the world is against camadian oil.

749 2018-11-09 22:41:56 Yes that means go get an oil change
750 2018-11-09 22:41:55 No palm oil in our house! Mainly rapeseed, coconut, olive oil, (for salads), and bags of linseeds ready to grind. I do check the labels. And wish I could afford avocado, safflower or almond oil...

763 2018-11-09 22:40:47 Iranian people have seen worse back in 80s. When the oil price was 15 $/bbl and they had to pay the expenses of war,
And unlike those days EU+Russia are supporting Iranian's cause.
764 2018-11-09 22:40:45 I think it’s because successive governments don’t have the guts to do the right thing - apply the law. They have sold out to oil money. They are listening to the “moderate” muslims who the Islamist thugs give a toss about. Scuze my French.
765 2018-11-09 22:40:41 Mad man said he's checking engine oil.
766 2018-11-09 22:40:36 I wonder how much palm oil is contributing to health probs. 60%saturated fat in cakes,b/fast cerials, choc, cakes/mixes, gravy granules,breads,biscuits,ready meals, soups,much more food than u 'd think...we consume far more than is healthy,  shopping trolleys full of products
767 2018-11-09 22:40:36 Not for recent political reasons you have to say is not clean, etc as top standards are followed every day in joint ventures with other intl oil companies. So don’t compare, just solve your internal issues and get competitive. Btw heavy oil in Venezuela is not as the Oil sands

779 2018-11-09 22:39:43 A lot of economic activity is plagued by abundance rather than scarcity, and is only profitable if scarcity is imposed- oil for instance, where cartels have been the norm. Intellectual property is another representation of this problem.
780 2018-11-09 22:39:42 Should I not be buying items with "sustainable palm oil" in them?
781 2018-11-09 22:39:39 What's crazy is so many people think US oil will make the US energy independent. They don't know that we don't produce light, sweet crude for gasoline. We still have to buy Opec.

So why not invest the money in renewables that WILL increase energy independence?
782 2018-11-09 22:39:37 I'll never understand people blindly ploughing their money into other people's tips. The net is full of snake oil salesmen...If you like horses have fun and try win yourself?? Least it's all on you.

785 2018-11-09 22:39:15 We need to point a finger at the real culprits behind these wildfires —> the fossil fuel industry. 

In CA, the Western States Petroleum Association is the oil industry’s equivalent of the NRA. They’ve done everything they can to prevent us from addressing the climate crisis.
786 2018-11-09 22:39:15 5. FF's exist because there is market demand. Killing an oil company will not change this demand, it will merely shift access.

6. Ultimately, the fix for CC is a reduced world population. If we adapt to a warmer climate, we may very well have a somewhat "soft landing".
787 2018-11-09 22:39:02 I drove approximately 800 miles in one week seeing @PRETTYMUCH three times... I think it’s time for an oil change
788 2018-11-09 22:39:01 @IcelandFoods.  Wonderful Christmas advert. I’ll buy from you to support “ban palm oil.”
789 2018-11-09 22:39:01 I’ve had the discussion about the impact of palm oil in two classes this week - this @IcelandFoods advert can certainly support this now!
790 2018-11-09 22:39:00 Let’s all take a quick sec remember that lil Wayne once rhymed “chance I’ll fall” with “olive oil” and it worked. It was actually a successful lyric wow.
791 2018-11-09 22:38:20 i need to try a few weeks/a month of eating solely whole food plant based w no oil because i swear as soon as i eat anything oily or processed i feel like actual crap

794 2018-11-09 22:38:00 When the oil and money run out.
795 2018-11-09 22:37:59 Your head get oil
796 2018-11-09 22:37:48 Iceland are withdrawing palm oil from all of their own branded products so it's an issue they are serious about. I applaud them for trying to bring it to the attention of the public.
797 2018-11-09 22:37:42 This is beautifully done and well done Iceland may other stores follow removing palm oil! And may this advert be shown important awareness raising! #savetheorangutangs
798 2018-11-09 22:37:41 Note: Cupboard staples like salt, pepper, and oil, are not counted in the three ingredients.
799 2018-11-09 22:37:41 The ad wasn’t banned by advertising regulators, it seems like a shameless jumping on the bandwagon when other U.K. retailers have been 100% using certified sustainable oil for years now, which funds repairing the damage rather than running away from the issue after making ££..!

802 2018-11-09 22:37:38 Shared! As I've said in my tweet, Palm Oil is in so many products that's it's virtually impossible to avoid but we have to try where and when we can 
803 2018-11-09 22:37:33 The oil industry has had a free ride on your back Canadian tax payers. Many billions given by various govts. Many morebillions to clean the mess they created. One thing abt solar, no clean up required
804 2018-11-09 22:37:29 They’ve never been right on oil calls
805 2018-11-09 22:37:13 So the solution is to move that oil by burning fossil fuels in motorized transport (trains and trucks) at risk of spills through accident and derailment?
Whatever you're smoking Tommy boy, keep it away from me please.
806 2018-11-09 22:37:10 Yes inc palm oil its because they recognise we are so obsessed as,a culture these days with image conscious values and palm oil is just not a necessity.

813 2018-11-09 22:36:25 Remember a post you made criticizing for PMB when the governor of Jigawa state ordered for the arrest of someone who smear on Facebook? Instead of criticizing the governor you were criticizing the president and I engaged. You couldn't bear my superior argument and you blocked me.
814 2018-11-09 22:36:23 @KelloggsUK  stop using palm oil. I won’t buy your products again until you do.
815 2018-11-09 22:36:15 I do agree with the ad in some respects, though I feel like the palm oil as a crop is kind of "demonized" instead of the company that is planting the seeds irresponsibly. Lets not forget about the companies and organisations that aim for #sustainablepalmoil
816 2018-11-09 22:36:13 Cbd oil has helped me with anxiety and falling asleep too
817 2018-11-09 22:36:08 약간 생존형 동물의숲?? 고런느김!!
818 2018-11-09 22:36:00 ...the power of the palm oil industry is alarming...'does not comply with political rules'...I strongly suggest the agency vetting advertisement in this case 'Clearcast' take a long hard look at its political allegiances & public pressure be applied...their bias is concerning..
819 2018-11-09 22:35:59 How do you make these? Slice mediumly, pour oil&spice on them, bake, or are there other steps first like boiling or microwaving them?
820 2018-11-09 22:35:50 I be looking forward to changing my oil. Feeling like a part-time mechanic, working for free.
821 2018-11-09 22:35:47 Our government and the US government caused this, as much as the Saudis did, and it's all for oil.

Sad, isn't it?
822 2018-11-09 22:35:46 So my mom found a 2 liter of Que oil in my trunk. She asks me “what’s in that bottle?”. I tell her it’s my fraternity drink. THIS lady gonna day “Oh I hope it’s not blood.” 

 Blood 
823 2018-11-09 22:35:46 Is oil a leading indicAtor?
824 2018-11-09 22:35:38 Let me think of what else could go wrong... Well, how about SP500 losing another 70 points while oil drops another $4? That could bring us closer to the bottom.
825 2018-11-09 22:35:36 We have 10's of thousands of miles of pipelines and hardly ever an leak.
Would you rather use trucks, trains or god forbid ships? 
From oil we get gas. From drilling we get Nat. Gas which runs the plants you charge electric cars from.  We need a blend of energy production.
826 2018-11-09 22:35:17 Yeah the British realised the benefits of oil like the Irish got one thing right when someone told them gold was valuable and so they stole land from the native Americans and embarked on a genocide thanks to the likes of Irish General little Phil Sheridan
827 2018-11-09 22:35:04 I live in a state where Medical Cannabis is Legal. A patient that I caregive for "had" stomach cancer. It was growing when we started him on RSO (Rick Simpson Oil). After two months he got another scope done on his stomach and the tumors shrank. Few months later, They were gone.
828 2018-11-09 22:35:00 Have to get some black seed oil
829 2018-11-09 22:34:56 Have you stopped selling all products with palm oil in?
830 2018-11-09 22:34:47 Im sure they do business deals with big cattle Ranch or OIL owners! Why would they KILL horses if they didnt Work with some that sells Horse meat from slaughter  

It was a HUGE Horse meat scandal in Europe where a company delivering cattle meat to ready meals had used part horse

833 2018-11-09 22:34:23 Utterly despicable decision by @Clearcast. Calling BS. Viewers deserve better. Bravo to @IcelandFoods on a beautiful ad. As a customer I hope your palm oil policy spreads to all products you sell. #rangtan #PalmOilFreeChristmas
834 2018-11-09 22:34:19 My biggest oil fear is what happens in the middle east when the oil money seriously dries up.
835 2018-11-09 22:34:09 Pls don't engage me young activist as like calling yourself. If you forgot me I didn't forget you. I engaged you in early 2016 on Facebook when you were newly recruited by senator and couldn't withstand me , you blocked . If I start with you would your balance
836 2018-11-09 22:34:07 Well an EU army could be a threat to the US army who go around bombing the world for oil

840 2018-11-09 22:33:44 you need to sleep more, sir. Health first and I dont but I heard fish oil is good for you.
841 2018-11-09 22:33:38 i’m in a good mood right now which is super rare but i’m so happy and i have my essential oil diffuser on and now it smells like lavender in my room and i’m getting really excited about my future and AH
842 2018-11-09 22:33:33 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
843 2018-11-09 22:33:29 Nope. This is pan fried in deep oil like you fry meatballs or chicken cutlet. Not just in a pan with a little butter or on a griddle top like a pancake.
844 2018-11-09 22:33:26 Absolutely staggering decision by some irresponsible, faceless suit to ban Iceland's ad. We should all help it to go viral & support Iceland's courage by not buying palm oil products.

848 2018-11-09 22:32:18 Have you tried a couple of few pure lavender oil drops on the pillow or hops tea? Ideally loose leaf, better results.
849 2018-11-09 22:32:17 We are at the car dealership while I get an oil change and there’s a tv and Matthias is so frustrated bc he wants to watch Mickey Mouse but it’s not on right now and he’s so used to Netflix and being able to watch whatever he wants whenever he wants 
850 2018-11-09 22:32:17 Coconut Oil — good or bad for you?
851 2018-11-09 22:32:16 when I have oil in my hair my face automatically looks peng and my skin looks so clear?
852 2018-11-09 22:32:15 just ordered some cbd oil. hoping it helps with my anxiety 
853 2018-11-09 22:32:14 Sorry Jim but i dont eat black gold, wear black gold and watch black gold at the movie theatre.  So if oil is going to end this inflation.... and wage inflation? I dont think so.

856 2018-11-09 22:31:45 It could even be said that the RSPO is part of the problem rather than part of the solution, as it gives a veneer of respectability for the palm oil industry as a whole, arguably, no doubt inadvertently helping to perpetuate the wipeout of forests & wildlife including Orangutans
857 2018-11-09 22:31:43 Oil just did something it hasn't done in more than 30 years (hint: it isn't good) - MarketWatch
858 2018-11-09 22:31:32 yeah, this kinda makes sense. I think republicans looking for something that speaks to them are more likely to work for oil or defense/intel, or put work into trying to make mainstream products more conservative-friendly vs explicitly fash-branded products
859 2018-11-09 22:31:23 Yes, especially since (a) we have the expertise here; and (b) US enviro think tanks are funded by US big oil/gas interests looking to displace Canadian resources (successfully, so far).
860 2018-11-09 22:31:13 The palm oil used in the majority of products we have access to, because it’s cheap and it makes chocolate and gravy extra shiny (?), is from those deforested habitats. And yes, something else would take its place if it was banned. What needs to be banned is mass deforestation.
861 2018-11-09 22:31:13 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
862 2018-11-09 22:31:09 The @IcelandFoods advert that’s been banned is beautiful and breaks my heart & should be shown everywhere BUT it’s not got anything to do with Christmas  I will however, start checking products I use & if containing palm oil I won’t use them.
863 2018-11-09 22:31:02 اصل الحجات دي بتتنظر والعين كسحت الحجر
864 2018-11-09 22:31:01 I don’t think so, it’s not political to any means. The only reason for restricting it seems to be that the companies and government don’t want sales of Palm oil products to decrease, it seems purely of an economic motive. It’s a good advert in my opinion.
865 2018-11-09 22:30:47 Like turning iron wire into musical steel string. Was there olive oil? (E8 Fromage)
866 2018-11-09 22:30:40 I took a sip of da oil yella, it pulled me down to a lower level
867 2018-11-09 22:30:39 Totally agree. Being passive just enables the snake oil salesman to perform. Boycott press conferences and rallies.
868 2018-11-09 22:30:35 Have you ever considered CBD Oil?
869 2018-11-09 22:30:26 Show us the one Ruffy did
870 2018-11-09 22:30:25 Are they running a study on the environmental impact of all the Diesel trucks and trains presently at this moment transporting the oil? Pipeline has 0 environmental impact once in place.
871 2018-11-09 22:30:17 In my humble opinion, Dave Parker should have been on that list. Was he? Never forget a throw he made at the ‘79 allstar game.
872 2018-11-09 22:30:17 Illumi is so slimy they're DRIPPING in oil
873 2018-11-09 22:30:10 Interesting to see the furore about Palm Oil rearing its head. A few observations in a short thread. Palm oil is pretty much the most efficient oil producing crop. Most alternatives suggested by anti-palm activists need more land mass. Palm is in shitloads of what we all buy /1
874 2018-11-09 22:30:08 @IcelandFoods have had this in the offing for a long time now,way before this advert! What part of removing all palm oil from the own brand products isn’t being part of the solution over its use?It is one hell of an overhaul to make and surely others will reluctantly follow suit?
875 2018-11-09 22:30:05 Filthy low grade oil that powers the very technology you are using to post here. That would make you a #Hypocrite, but then again, what's new?
876 2018-11-09 22:30:03 Tea-tree oil. I love it! 
877 2018-11-09 22:30:02 coconut oil has been my greatest gift. i use it to take my makeup off and it basically melts off! clinique also has bomb makeup removers and they’re usually on sale or in bundles on sephora for pretty cheap!
878 2018-11-09 22:29:57 Worst thing about CBD oil is keeping it in your mouth for a minute without swallowing.. yaaaaukkk
879 2018-11-09 22:29:55 After slumping Thurs, many energy stocks held up Fri despite oil ending below $60 for first time since March. Is mkt sensing a bottom for oil? Fri movers:

Occidental $OXY +1.3%
Phillips $PSX +1.1
Anadarko $APC +0.7
$EOG +0.6
Chevron $CVX +0.1

881 2018-11-09 22:29:48 Loving the Iceland advert? Charlie’s Chippy in Urmston uses Palm Oil.
882 2018-11-09 22:29:47 Oil prices down, gas prices are up.
Someone's lining their pockets with our money while taking government subsidies and that bigly tax break #CadetBoneSpurs conned America into.
883 2018-11-09 22:29:36 Fourth, I was promised free oil changes at time of sale. I have yet to be able to get anyone in the @hudson_kia_ service department to answer the phone. So I paid $80 for oil change elsewhere, only to later be told by @hudson_kia_ that could void future service. @kia

887 2018-11-09 22:29:28 Some gas station operators appear to have discovered a way to reverse the law of gravity -- especially with regard to gasoline prices.  When the price of oil goes up, their prices shoot up immediately.  When the price of oil falls, their prices go down slower than Heinz ketchup.
888 2018-11-09 22:29:07 Wow just oil and cock x
889 2018-11-09 22:28:57 Isn’t the only difference oil ???
890 2018-11-09 22:28:56 So we can ban an advert for a frozen food outlet as “too political” because it’s stopped using palm oil in its products & points out on the impact on the environment. The same week the White House lies to try and silence the press who challenge the politics of POTUS! #madness
891 2018-11-09 22:28:54 Greenpeace could have made ads about anything in the world but they choose this anti palm oil ad. Coincidence? It’s a mega secret campaign buy Europe & USA soy,corn,sunflower & olive oil producers to destroy Asia’s palm oil production & market. We see u !
892 2018-11-09 22:28:51 It needs to be refined. That happens near the ports. Now, the Canadian oil is shipped elsewhere to be refined.
893 2018-11-09 22:28:36 This is a blow to Canada! You nice Americans will continue to buy our oil for $25 a barrel & ship it on trains lol.
894 2018-11-09 22:28:25 Definitely a difference from the Gulf Coast to the dry west.
895 2018-11-09 22:28:24 Lightning will replace beard oil.
896 2018-11-09 22:28:19 Interesting, that the alleged ban on an Iceland ad critical of palm oil production is because that message is political but countless ads asking people to buy products despite the harm they cause is considered non-political.
897 2018-11-09 22:28:05 Im not slagging off business coaches. let me make it clear if you have never been in business for  good few years then your not a business coach. your a snake oil snake person so piss off and stop stealing people money ratbags.

919 2018-11-09 22:26:05 Try a naturopath. There's a good one on Spring Garden. But you should look into full spectrum CBD oil.
920 2018-11-09 22:26:02 how bout asking Warren Buffet (who owns the railway now transporting the oil) how much "impact" he had in this decision.
921 2018-11-09 22:26:01 Thank you to the sensors who knew right fr wrong. The ad was def anti palm oil & it will give out wrong messages to every viewer. Many palm oil farms are privately owned lands too which are used as palm oil estate since Malaya got its independence.

924 2018-11-09 22:25:28 Back in 1973/75, the UK was almost economically abankrupt (I remember the electricity blackouts, oil crisis, anyhow). UK had different priorities then from CH, NO, etc.
Just 5 months to ensure that a "just in time" economy can continue for everybody requires compromise
925 2018-11-09 22:25:15 Having experienced cannabis highs for many years & having a penchant for getting a little out of control occasionally, made the surprise/shock that cannabis oil high did more than give me a happy buzz, hilariously fun. Absent the enjoyment of losing control, a person may panic?
926 2018-11-09 22:25:12 They say it’s o political.....what they mean is it’s TRUE also Iceland will not be sellers no anything to do with Palm oil @IcelandFoods  RESPECT to you 
927 2018-11-09 22:25:06 My diet macros are based on the following:

(body weight in lbs = protein in grams) + 50% calories from fats (healthy fats i.e. avocado, butter, coconut, olive oil, etc and not seed based poly oils) + remaining as carbs
928 2018-11-09 22:24:58 Sauté, Adam. Sauté. It’s just throwing some oil or butter in a skillet!
929 2018-11-09 22:24:52 Ugh. Maybe use a leather conditioner or oil on the whole thing? Or contact madewell for recommendations
930 2018-11-09 22:24:49 Yea true. But there is a limit to which the reserves can bear before the exchange rate blinks. The rate of decerese in the reserves was astonishing even with crude oil price at $70-80.

At, less than $70 now, I can only sit down and watch what to come in coming days...

944 2018-11-09 22:23:11 can you provide any evidence that petrodollars exist? not an article by mentioning it, but an evidence that any country must hold USD reserves in order to pay for oil
945 2018-11-09 22:23:09 You actually can do that if you have oil mixed in with it, like for your chainsaw.

954 2018-11-09 22:21:46 Tactic of a desperate politician is to invoke God in his/her rhetoric! Morrison has played his ‘God bothering’ card too early, and has exhausted all the tricks in his  snake oil box. How much lower can this despicable excuse for a politician stoop? Obviously his  God is deaf.
955 2018-11-09 22:21:46 I watched this advert and thought it was great how it raised awareness about palm oil and the plight of the orangutans ..It makes me want to shop at @IcelandFoods as they are showing compassion for wildlife over corporate greed and how this advert was banned I do not know 
956 2018-11-09 22:21:44 Tbh I haven’t really noticed it as anything other than palm oil but it’s just so difficult to avoid.

But you’re right, these people ranting about it now literally go shopping and not even blink an eye
957 2018-11-09 22:21:23 - if anyone wants to know how my nights going my child won’t stop screaming & I just burned myself w 450 degree oil trying to cook empanadas

961 2018-11-09 22:21:00 I’ve just seen this advert on another tweet and shared. Palm Oil is such a massive issue, it needs to be the biggest Christmas message!

I can write a list as long as my arm of America making up BS excuses for the atrocities it’s created.
The EU is not without its fair share of this too, but c’mon!
966 2018-11-09 22:20:42 Don't forget the birds killed by wind turbines and the constant need for lubrication which is mostly mineral oil that is seldom safely disposed of.
967 2018-11-09 22:20:32 I've just come across a company claiming to make eco-friendly skincare products. But, after looking in detail into the ingredients list (not just the short list that they provide next to the product) it turns out that palm oil is one of their main ingredients . Don't lie.
968 2018-11-09 22:20:31 Google's definition of fracking for the gas companies "the process of injecting liquid at high pressure into subterranean rocks, boreholes, etc., so as to force open existing fissures and extract oil or gas." #Fracking
969 2018-11-09 22:20:23 Nope. Try oil.
970 2018-11-09 22:20:11 I live in an almost total oil patch town . This is usually time of year the patch heats up. This year like last . Crickets. Talking down to people hurting like I see daily does not help your cause/s
971 2018-11-09 22:20:04 The oil field wastes so much money just from different crews sitting around doing waiting to do different jobs
972 2018-11-09 22:20:00 I see it as people who don't take the time to read the voter guide and go by whatever the ads and papers tell them. And when you've got McKenna bullet pointing items, while Inslee just says "Don't believe big oil"..People made decisions based on what was in front of them.
973 2018-11-09 22:19:46 Peppermint oil and lavender oil. On my temples and in a diffuser In the house. I also pay attention and work on controlling my breathing. It’s helped me for years 
974 2018-11-09 22:19:37 I never shopped at Iceland when I was on the mainland, I respect their stance on palm oil and it's damaging impacts just for cheap oil for consumers. The meat supply is another situation that gets addressed 
975 2018-11-09 22:19:35 99% peeps love fried plantain, unripe plantain can make one wait patiently for it to ripe. when you are frying the plantain, men! You can endure some small small pains from hot oil

978 2018-11-09 22:19:22 the only time i've seen this kind of argument (from meat eaters) is the almond milk one which is completely debunked when it's compared to what livestock feed on. are you not fussed about palm oil consumption then?
979 2018-11-09 22:19:09 Kamisama. All I ask of you is there to be oil and flour so can make last minute pancakes

983 2018-11-09 22:18:51 I'm trying to shame big industrial users of palm oil, who will be the ones putting private pressure on Clearcast to ban ads like this.
984 2018-11-09 22:18:49 Why are we still paying for a depression area program? Oh what, because big corporate farms lobby for government handouts like big oil. What a bunch of crap!
985 2018-11-09 22:18:46 When the guy that did your oil change finds me on FB.. ew what the actual fuck, get outta here.
986 2018-11-09 22:18:44 honestly I don’t even use rags, i just go in with an oil cleanser and follow up w a 2nd water based cleanser and a silicone scrubber. I feel like those microfiber cloths tug at my skin too much :/
987 2018-11-09 22:18:40 Some kids get lucky with that. I was rarely sick growing up, BUT you best believe Big Mama had some Tussin, Castor Oil, and beef broth on hand.

990 2018-11-09 22:18:26 As great as it is to see people learning about palm oil deforestation and getting rightly outraged..  it's frustrating that nobody's outraged about deforestation for animal agriculture
991 2018-11-09 22:18:25 Which will result in an oil glut similar to the early 1980’s.  Prices will drop due to over supply and the economy will take off again.
992 2018-11-09 22:18:19 i got my OIL CHANGED and im FILLIN MY GAS TANK and im FUCKIN HUNGRY
993 2018-11-09 22:17:50 And the "Saudi" part is just a convenient excuse -- Saudi oil was fine for decades, despite well-known human rights issues (and even radical "islam"/terrorism issues).
But *now* all of a sudden, cheap oil maybe coming from Saudi Arabia is a big deal.
994 2018-11-09 22:17:49 I struggle to completely avoid palm oil because it’s in EVERYTHING
995 2018-11-09 22:17:49 Where is my CBD oil?
996 2018-11-09 22:17:48 North*
997 2018-11-09 22:17:30 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
998 2018-11-09 22:17:21 Scientists have calculated that on each single day of the year the heat energy received from the sun is equal to a third of all the reserves of coal and oil that are there in the earth. OIL RICH MAN POOR MAN - (KHERA), who himself sounds a bit LIMEY
999 2018-11-09 22:17:21 If the Canadian government insists on these type of standards on our oil industry.. is it the same standard on the oil coming in.. we won’t buy anything unless it has these standards.. meaning more investors/ investments we need here for such high standards etc
1000 2018-11-09 22:17:18 I've stopped buying things made from palm oil. I always check!
It is so bad thought that so many earthing that is not of our kind has already died because i want fat on my bread, but could had been made from other sources to do so. I already knew our species are cheap and greedy.
1001 2018-11-09 22:17:16 4-0 Saskatoon. Shots are 7-2. 5 mins left in the first.
1002 2018-11-09 22:17:14 After watching the banned @IcelandFoods Christmas ad, I had a look through my cupboards to see what we contained palm oil. I was surprised to see although @KingsmillCare bread used palm oil, it was the only product we had that used SUSTAINABLE palm oil! Well done! 
1003 2018-11-09 22:17:13 Have to lather up in fckn coconut oil

1006 2018-11-09 22:17:03 The last time I checked the South is divided too; SS,SE & SW..And that division exists even in your political decisions. The might be more united politically for the simple reason they produce more leaders.
1007 2018-11-09 22:17:02 hyungwon hates eating radish with olive oil
1008 2018-11-09 22:16:58 .@SandyOgg1. Thanks Vincent! Likewise, dopey clown @ariannahuff told her minions at @AIPAC yesterday to increase oil production.
1009 2018-11-09 22:16:58 just started oil cleansing let's see how this goes
1010 2018-11-09 22:16:44 it was my understanding the Keystone Pipeline was simply to get the oil to Port traveling through the United States to the Gulf. From the golf it would be exported elsewhere not to be sold in the USA. So which is it?
1011 2018-11-09 22:16:43 brought mascara that has canabis oil in it - if i can’t smoke it , imma wear it !
1012 2018-11-09 22:16:40 Rather win with integrity  and pride than oil and blood money.
1013 2018-11-09 22:16:39 Combo of red oil and sugar.
1014 2018-11-09 22:16:39 Yes the pure oil is much better
1015 2018-11-09 22:16:30 oil pastels?
1016 2018-11-09 22:16:26 The only thing I’m concerned about it makeup removers.. I use the neutrogena ones but I feel like they have a lot of oil
1017 2018-11-09 22:16:24 Take a tablespoon of oil of oregano! Horrible taste, but I swear it works.
1018 2018-11-09 22:16:13 No problem.  The palm oil tweet clinched it.
1019 2018-11-09 22:16:11 Who said sum bout oil? Bitch you cooking?
1020 2018-11-09 22:16:11 Yep. Population had to be reduced because no jobs due to automation. Oil had all been found and running out. Shale oil was known about in the 60's but not talked about. We have trained monkeys for leaders
1021 2018-11-09 22:16:08 Not at all. Oil money dictating what UK media reports. More likely to deflect the FFP scandal which the media would rather not report on..... Wonder why?
1022 2018-11-09 22:15:59 Unless you're a super rich oil tycoon, what are the benefits of being a climate-change sceptic?
1023 2018-11-09 22:15:55 I use coconut oil and it works wonders! It’s also naturally antibacterial and a moisturizer + comes in a glass jar so no plastic (I use all waterproof/long-lasting stuff too)
1024 2018-11-09 22:15:55 It's mad that as parts of America burn because of climate change its leader denies its existence and pushes for more oil pipelines and coal jobs.
1025 2018-11-09 22:15:53 take a spoonful of olive oil
1026 2018-11-09 22:15:47 And you never saw anything wrong in the policy that the present government used in crashing the economy? The financial policies were flawed and they were not really equipped to handle the economy so we're busy experimenting. It's not just about oil, they we blindsided
1027 2018-11-09 22:15:45 Moj the oil sheik. Great look buddy.
1028 2018-11-09 22:15:45 My news feed is full of Orangutans and anti palm oil statues thanks to Iceland, its something I have been talking about for a while and I'm so pleased to see the advert is working, even if it is just amongst my friends list. #SaveOrangutan #saynotopalmoil
1029 2018-11-09 22:15:40 It does but there is no way for the oil to get from the west coast to the east coast. #EnergyEast

get involved. they'll quintuple in 2-3 years.
1031 2018-11-09 22:15:34 I agree - I think it’s bad to demonise all palm oil. It’s about sustainability surely. We had it in many dishes living in brazil it was locally produced and obtainable. If you banned all palm oil surely something else fills the gap? Im 100% behind protecting the environment thou
1032 2018-11-09 22:15:32 i have no oil money left
1033 2018-11-09 22:15:20 It seems palm oil is in so much more than I ever knew. And some vegan cheese as well, absolute madness! If nothing else, the banned  @IcelandFoods has had more impact than it would if it had aired. God bless the internet.
1034 2018-11-09 22:15:15 In fairness, it will get far more publicity (and awareness for the evil that is palm oil) than if it hadn't. If I was a cynic I would've said it was intentional.
1035 2018-11-09 22:15:12 Are you equivocating Iran and terrorism? Strange, I don’t remember Iranians funding Wahhabis, Al Queda, ISIS, committing genocide in Yemen, funding 9/11...... the list goes on. All that oil money from the Saudis tho, much more important. Not to say Iran doesn’t have their faults.

1037 2018-11-09 22:14:52 When I started making soap, I used to use palm oil that was supposedly responsibly sourced. I have since stopped using it altogether because even the responsibly sourced stuff is iffy. #savetheorangutans
1038 2018-11-09 22:14:44 They are literally telling people that they can make the "ethical choice" by purchasing the ANIMAL PRODUCTS they sell (since those animal products won't contain palm oil). Would you be supporting them if they were promoting free-range products instead?
1039 2018-11-09 22:14:43 Or atleast palm oil thats sourced correctly. Rant over im away to cry about wee #Rangtan
1040 2018-11-09 22:14:35 "Your check engine light is on" yea I KNOW I'm a poor bitch just change my oil and let me live
1041 2018-11-09 22:14:28 I don’t use makeup wipes to take off my makeup. I use olive oil or coconut oil.
1042 2018-11-09 22:14:24 West Africa also produced palm oil...
1043 2018-11-09 22:14:19 I stand with Standing Rock against pipelines and oil barons.
1044 2018-11-09 22:14:15 So the oil price that went down in 2014bcaused suicides in 2004? Even though OBJ was able to harness his govt & economy with oil price below $30. Now that the oil is above $80, what is happening? At least, a little relieve. Bizmen & C/servants r still crying. R they also looting?

1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons canola oil
6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1046 2018-11-09 22:14:01 Thought it was a touching and thought provoking and, can't see why it is banned... Can only see the big corporations that use palm oil, complaining about it.
1047 2018-11-09 22:13:49 Excellent writing, beautiful and I bet ya we'll do the oil human rights abusers city on Sunday.
1048 2018-11-09 22:13:47 the only people (until today) that I saw bang on about palm oil were vegans who said that eating palm oil wasn't vegan. and I've always felt weird conveniently ignoring it...
1049 2018-11-09 22:13:39 actually crying at the iceland advert  literally had no idea how bad the damage was by producing palm oil my heart is broken 
1050 2018-11-09 22:13:28 Iceland became political with an advert (trying to prevent palm oil) will you stop shopping there?? Or is it just convicted criminals of assault and fraud that you don’t like being addressed?
1051 2018-11-09 22:13:25 lol, those are the oil & gas licensing companies which are just glorified accounting operations. They hire the geo specialists to go in and do the real work.
1052 2018-11-09 22:13:15 The proposed gun reforms would be awesome except we know from viewing other countries results they don't work.   You're selling snake oil.

1056 2018-11-09 22:12:58 But they sell products containing palm oil? Ironic slightly?
1057 2018-11-09 22:12:57 CBD vs Copiaba oil. This is a great informative read!
1058 2018-11-09 22:12:55 @grazedotcom why do you use palm oil in your products?
1059 2018-11-09 22:12:47 CBD vs Copiaba oil. This is a great informative read!
1060 2018-11-09 22:12:45 Sure, there's no God, but my Check Engine light just spontaneously went out on its own without me even changing the oil, so don't tell me there are no miracles
1061 2018-11-09 22:12:43 Goosebumps. Always check for palm oil in ingredients. Hate what we are doing 
1062 2018-11-09 22:12:35 Despite frontline community resistance, @jerrybrowngov approved 21,397 new oil & gas permits. This is no climate legacy. @GavinNewsom, don't follow the same pattern. End fossil fuel permits & protect frontline communities #NewsomsGoldenOpportunity #Advice4Gavin @sacbee_news

1068 2018-11-09 22:11:43 let’s get this 

1 package active dry yeast
2-1/4 cups warm water 
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons canola oil
6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1069 2018-11-09 22:11:40 It does have side effects. My mom has to take it every day now. It's given her diabetes. It's that or not breathe. My cousin has colitis. He's had several surgeries, had most or all of his bowel removed but he's still going. I wonder if a decent CBD oil would help.
1070 2018-11-09 22:11:34 Dunno, no seen it, but if anything to do with @Nestle , you know where you can stick  the 4 fingers  I’m sure there’s alternatives for palm oil to be used.
1071 2018-11-09 22:11:33 the advert IS actually fantastic. Iceland should donate the cost of airtime to greenpeace, put it out a few times at peak times, run their food ads adjacent, then the palm oil message has a context.  Iceland wanted to be the good guys, but on the cheap (just my theory)
1072 2018-11-09 22:11:29 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
1073 2018-11-09 22:11:24 My social media is full of people commenting on the Palm oil advert but the sad reality is probably 1% of those people will actually make the necessary changes
1074 2018-11-09 22:11:08 天気曇りっぽいけど安定のまじてんイベントだから晴れるな！
1075 2018-11-09 22:10:55 If they get oil money, I'm gonna start watching netball.  The media love in is bad enough now.

1088 2018-11-09 22:10:12 crush a few tablets of charcoal (buy from pharmacy, its for diarrhea) and mix with some soda bicarbonate and yogurt and use this to clean your skin. rinse well and thoroughly. apply concentrated Vit E oil sparingly after washing

1090 2018-11-09 22:09:49 Really need to get my oil changed I been bs
1091 2018-11-09 22:09:49 I got told twice today I don't look 29. That shea butter and coconut oil treatin ya girl right lol
1092 2018-11-09 22:09:38 I have several questions
1093 2018-11-09 22:09:29 Peel them off. 10 days is good. Do four more days of not fully soaking it. Then start applying bio oil twice a day  #professionalscargirl
1094 2018-11-09 22:09:27 @APPropst  How will this affect oil prices in the US?
1095 2018-11-09 22:09:24 #まじてんらいぶ の朝
1096 2018-11-09 22:09:20 US WTI oil falls to $59.40/bbl; some are still hopeful it will be back to $100 by 2020, No one seems to ask the obvious question: why is the world accepting an oil cartel in the 1st place? US companies participate in the cartel: doesnt this violate US law?
1097 2018-11-09 22:09:18 Yes all of the real time material simulation they showed off at various conferences is going to be fully used by every industrial design company in the world, every construction/architecture/environmental design firm globally, every geological exploration firm (oil, gas, mining).
1098 2018-11-09 22:08:58 It’s too late. Canada will have an irrelevant energy industry  permanently. Our oil sells below $20. Our gas is free. We make no wind turbines, batteries, or solar panels in Canada. We no longer make nukes. All of this has been given away for nothing to the US. It’s over boys.
1099 2018-11-09 22:08:46 Tonight's dinner is a harvest from our trip yesterday to Arthur Ave., Bronx's "Little Italy." Burrata cheese with fresh cherry tomatoes, basil, balsamic vinegar (25 year, the real stuff!), white truffle oil (real stuff), arugula, prosciutto daniele, Italian bread, cracked pepper.
1100 2018-11-09 22:08:45 Gold and oil prices are receding is correlation with grain/softs strong weak or can become unhinged and trade on there own?
1101 2018-11-09 22:08:43 ストーリーもスキルパネルの解放もやれてない
1102 2018-11-09 22:08:24 Hhhhhhhh bad brain daaaayyyy at least I got an oil change already god that took too long
1103 2018-11-09 22:08:18 I can see it now, @AJA_Cortes caught in a scandal for cutting his authentic snake oil with extra virgin olive oil due to supply constraints 
1104 2018-11-09 22:08:09 What are you doing Rachel? There's oil to complain about #KeystoneXL
1105 2018-11-09 22:08:07 Canada does not want a oil industry, we can buy oil from bad countries as per all the lefties, maybe lefties should block up their cars
1106 2018-11-09 22:08:05 Replace all coal/oil burning power gemeration with solar, all over the world, bonus:construct the solar where the oil was and tie into substation lines. All new home construction to include solar and state sponsor cheap dependable electric cars buses and rigs. LEDs only tada
1107 2018-11-09 22:08:03 Definitely not. And because of the ban, it's raised more attention. Palm oil doesn't need to be in every single food. Forests don't need to be shut down. We need these forests and we need every single animal not to be extinct.
1108 2018-11-09 22:07:54 Rather it was “loot the oil” reason 
1109 2018-11-09 22:07:50 Who is Orang U Tang? 
Iceland does not know the joyful taste of boiled white yam with fresh palm oil seasoned with salt and pepper. 
1110 2018-11-09 22:07:50 Then I turned to another section at random about a servant giving someone many things of wood, and other items, and baths of wine and oil.  Then I remembered someone saying:  No, don't go near Tom right now.  He's 60 seconds away from a melt-down" which made me remember M.D.
1111 2018-11-09 22:07:45 Oil by pipeline is more energy efficient than by rail and truck.
1112 2018-11-09 22:07:17 Better when olive oil is used as spread instead of butter
1113 2018-11-09 22:07:14 I absolutely agree about the message and think it is great that more people will understand about palm oil. My concern is so many people saying  that they will shop at Iceland now like it is the ethical choice 
1114 2018-11-09 22:06:54 Weapons n oil rule the world
1115 2018-11-09 22:06:52 Bush did 9/11 and nobody is willing to admit it but me!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
1116 2018-11-09 22:06:50 #isitok that an advert highlighting the impact of palm oil is banned? Good on @IcelandFoods
1117 2018-11-09 22:06:43 Cannabis oil
1118 2018-11-09 22:06:30 my hair is buzzed right now so I don't really care for it, but when I grew my hair out, using coconut oil as a leave-in conditioner did wonders my my hair's length and durability 
1119 2018-11-09 22:06:24 Oil patch is suffering yes, but Alberta’s GDP remains the best in Canada.
1120 2018-11-09 22:06:23 Oluwole oil watchers.
1121 2018-11-09 22:06:21 Iran'd give these fuckers a hell of a rough time. With a population over 80M & control of the Strait of Hormuz—the choke point for oil flow out of the region—they're gonna think twice before trying a frontal aggression like they did Iraq. You never know with these clowns though.

1123 2018-11-09 22:05:31 if the damage to the environment doesn't impress them, let them know that Texaco lost its entire oil drilling rig operation down the sinkhole their drill accidentally created, too... maybe that will matter to them...
1124 2018-11-09 22:05:28 “why don’t you just change your own oil” because i’m a STUPID WOMAN do i LOOK like i can change my own oil
1125 2018-11-09 22:05:25 Best thing is build trans mountain pipeline as fast as we can, we don't  have to sell oil sands at a discount to the states.
1126 2018-11-09 22:05:23 U.S. stocks fell Friday as a combination of weak economic data from China and disappointing earnings hurt technology and internet companies. Crude oil prices fell for the 10th day in a row.
1127 2018-11-09 22:05:01 It's a repurposed Greenpeace video, so they probably knew that. Cue outrage and a load of free publicity. There will still be extracts and plugs for their palm oil free range.

1129 2018-11-09 22:04:45 Oil down and rates up means trouble in Frackville.
1130 2018-11-09 22:04:42 Hey, Todd..you still here? Fact-check: the oil from the pipeline is not ours...we are just the conveyance for Canada to sell it out of the country...how does that lower costs?
1131 2018-11-09 22:04:37 And as far as climate change solutions go, how was nationalization worked out? What are you going to do when the people want to keep that revenue stream? In Alaska I imagine they love their oil dividend.

1133 2018-11-09 22:04:26 Or it’s old ass gunky ass oil because you’re cheap and trying to ride it until the wheels fall off (like I did) 
1134 2018-11-09 22:04:16 We need to move away from oil use. It’s corrupting the world.
1135 2018-11-09 22:04:09 That cannae be true!
I keep the car topped up all the time, just in case. As you told us in 2014 that the oil was due to run out. Were you fibbing?
1136 2018-11-09 22:04:07 Haven’t got one locally, but well done to them for not using palm oil and playing a marketing blinder!
1137 2018-11-09 22:03:45 Rate of oil is at least price since 1984
60$/Barrel.
But in Pakistan at highest rate that Rs.99/Liter
Niya Pakistan Zindabad
1138 2018-11-09 22:03:38 And if it wasn't for an obstinate council would've been the Oil & Gas capital of Europe!! (Those local elections *are* important folks).
1139 2018-11-09 22:03:30 They're not going to lose anything, we do not export oil, therefore the global market is irrelevant. Oil companies sell wholesale anyway, so the loss isn't dramatic at all. No one will be losing jobs, the US likes to stockpile oil, therefore they are still needed to drill it.
1140 2018-11-09 22:03:30 a lot of that depends on the viscosity of the oil you're using. Which can make a big difference in colder temperatures. Unless you're in sub zero degree temperatures there isn't anything to worry about.
1141 2018-11-09 22:03:28 Lavender oil drops work wonders and are cheaper than a mist.
1142 2018-11-09 22:03:28 Oil n go lol
1143 2018-11-09 22:02:59 So they've banned the #IcelandAdvert for being political but are allowing the wanton destruction of our planet by the continued use of palm oil. Let's share it across the globe #savetheorangutans
1144 2018-11-09 22:02:43 Iceland the 1 palm oil 4 bumz
1145 2018-11-09 22:02:42 I actually look on packaging now to see if palm oil is involved.  If it is, I don’t buy it.
1146 2018-11-09 22:02:34 So I alternate weeks with this cycle. 
Regime 1
Liquid black soap w/rose hips 
Witch hazel
I use my face and beard moisturizer from koils by nature that has argan oil & chamomile in it
Then some of my beard oil usually gets on my face so I rub that in
1147 2018-11-09 22:02:28 Palm oil also has about 900 different bloody names. I need an app to tell me what i can buy thats palm oil free
1148 2018-11-09 22:02:22 Getting my oil changed: “Lyndsey, you know you need new tires on this thing?” 
Me: Randall, I need a lot of things.. new tires, a new door, an intervention for my drinking problems, a new sleep schedule, better eating habits, but ya know what.... I’m just here for the oil man
1149 2018-11-09 22:02:14 A man In The Bronx tried to take out his teenage son his 19 year old daughter her 2 month old Baby his mother and grandmother with hot oil and tried to burn the house  down 
1150 2018-11-09 22:02:00 I feel very fortunate I live in Colorado right now. But there is nothing “very stable” right now. And desperate delusional men will not go quietly. Our Justice Dept is under siege and these snake oil salesmen have conned their way to the top. So we have to fight bacn. Scary times
1151 2018-11-09 22:01:57 The problem with the Impossible Burger is that it uses coconut oil and therefore has *10 grams* of saturated fat! That’s three times what a McDonalds burger has! 
1152 2018-11-09 22:01:51 Oil of cloves numbs pain for a short time. I have some if you are desperate x

1155 2018-11-09 22:01:38 Piaaza bases, lipstick, vegan cheese, packaged bread, cookies, soap, detergent and so many more products we all use contail palm oil.
1156 2018-11-09 22:01:37 Can you guarantee that none of the products you sell contain palm oil?
1157 2018-11-09 22:01:32 Bawling on the bus after watching the Iceland Christmas advert no fuck palm oil :((
1158 2018-11-09 22:01:24 Hey bby. How about you grab that motor oil gurl. @RaineSN7
1159 2018-11-09 22:01:22 The juices spritzing out as I pull the peel back smell just like orange essential oil 
1160 2018-11-09 22:01:10 With the fed judge and OPEC meeting in December you better enjoy the low oil prices today , they will go up ,way up..
1161 2018-11-09 22:01:06 Farm Foods Veggie Kitchen sausages are palm oil free and delicious!
1162 2018-11-09 22:01:02 The article states it can replace current oil by rail and truck. Problem is, there is no more rail capacity to replace pipelines. As stated, this will help current rail transport but not reduce need for pipelines. Besides, oil by truck is dangerous for the public.
1163 2018-11-09 22:00:57 Got me evening primrose oil but my doctor doesn’t recommend me to use till I’m 38weeks I’m currently 35 weeks & 1 I’ve been doing so research and some women started taking it orally & vaginally by 35-36weeks anyone? I need help ?
1164 2018-11-09 22:00:48 I just wrote a post on the effects of palm oil. This is a subject every consumer should know about!
1165 2018-11-09 22:00:47 If there's a US campaign to sabotage the Canadian oil industry, it's being led by Justin Trudeau.
1166 2018-11-09 22:00:47 Cannot believe @IcelandFoods ad about not using palm oil was banned... sad & sickening to see that people clearly do not care about the world or the creatures in it, nor want to share the reality of what happens for your food! #NoPalmOilChristmas
1167 2018-11-09 22:00:44 Here are some uses and benefits of Clove oil. What is your favorite way to use this essential oil?
1168 2018-11-09 22:00:41 omg have you seen that Icelandic ad about palm oil destroying the habitats of orangutans? I feel so guilty for my decades of oily masturbation.
1169 2018-11-09 22:00:39 Oil prices are indeed down a lot from the $75 peak, but remember, they were just at $65 before everyone started worrying about Trump's sanctions on Iran, so the "real" price was probably closer to $65 all along. So, the better analysis might be that oil is at $60, down from $65.
1170 2018-11-09 22:00:38 Have done, there’s also an amazing website called say no to palm oil which gives people amazingly easy ways to make a difference daily. If we  all do one thing every day we can be the change.
1171 2018-11-09 22:00:35 U.S. stocks fell Friday as a combination of weak economic data from China and disappointing earnings hurt technology and internet companies. Crude oil prices fell for the 10th day in a row.

1173 2018-11-09 22:00:28 But he can't totally beat the market. Oil price is now $69 per barrel and the outflows persist. Well, time will tell sha.

1178 2018-11-09 22:00:16 November 09, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1179 2018-11-09 22:00:01 Chicken: spinach, artichoke heart, sun-dried tomato, garlic and olive oil, Fusilli
1180 2018-11-09 21:59:56 Pipelines are safer and more efficient than oil by rail and, for the few more years we need it, I'm a fan. All we need to do is shove TM through a few hundred thousand people in BC who don't want it going through their backyard. Piece of cake.
1181 2018-11-09 21:59:50 I dont have pain.but lot of stress and unhappiness.Does this oil come from the marijuana plant.Dont need to be high as my body is an auto brewery feel drunk stoned from candida years years and years.seems impossible to get rid of
1182 2018-11-09 21:59:48 are they vegan and are they palm oil free ?
1183 2018-11-09 21:59:46 Isn’t piping oil better for the economy then trucking or using a train to move it?
1184 2018-11-09 21:59:23 If ANYONE can find the “donuts at Krispy Kreme *video of 2 English girls on onlyfans glazing their boobs in oil or something*” tweet PLEASE send me it thank u
1185 2018-11-09 21:59:15 The energy sector is booming right now. Back to where it was prior to the bust when OPEC tried to pump them out of profits. Hell ya I support good paying jobs in America! If it comes by oil even better. We have plenty of it.
1186 2018-11-09 21:59:12 U.S. stocks fell Friday as a combination of weak economic data from China and disappointing earnings hurt technology and internet companies. Crude oil prices fell for the 10th day in a row.
1187 2018-11-09 21:59:03 No shame in playing second fiddle to Roberto! 
1188 2018-11-09 21:58:55 HED BE REALLY CUTE BUT I HATE HOW SHINY HE IS DID HE JUST DUNK HIS FACE IN SOME OLIVE OIL
1189 2018-11-09 21:58:52 Apparently coconut oil helps
1190 2018-11-09 21:58:47 The sprinklers need to spray oil based paint ... pick a bright color  ... a color that says I am a jerk ... I yell at folks houses and scare people
1191 2018-11-09 21:58:44 I have oily/combination skin that also reacts to scents and the cerave pm ultra lightweight oil free lotion makes my face like butter and helps me not produce so much oil because it hydrates deep
1192 2018-11-09 21:58:40 He’s a snake oil salesman. Faux Xhristian showing disrespect to genuine Christians. Makes their work harder.
1193 2018-11-09 21:58:38 This should not have been banned as it is not a political advert per se, what it is is a moving and informative way of highlighting the plight of orangutans, who are losing their natural forest habitat because of palm oil production.
1194 2018-11-09 21:58:29 True plus coconut oil does a WAY better job.
1195 2018-11-09 21:58:27 And I still can’t find a non dairy spread in the supermarket that doesn’t contain palm oil !!!!
1196 2018-11-09 21:58:25 On my Corolla I would give it some time in the winter because the oil was cold and the motor was already old enough and had enough abuse. I could hear the difference when I just went vs when I have it a minute. Maybe it was psychological but it seemed to not work as hard
1197 2018-11-09 21:58:18 Touchdown. Oil city

1199 2018-11-09 21:58:10 It took Donald John Trump just 4 years to make America the BIGGEST OIL producer in the world.
This is a big plus to him & Americans.

It took PMB just 4 years to make NGA the home of the POOREST PEOPLE in the world .
This is a big blow to Nigerians.

4 years is enough for change.
1200 2018-11-09 21:58:08 Islam is a unified socio-political system with a militarized wing, an educational wing, a religious wing, and enormous oil wealth. To them Sharia Law is above all other laws, and they will not assimilate.

1202 2018-11-09 21:57:57 No, they are simply upholding the law as it stands. 
Oil has been going down for years yet gas prices keep going up. If Republicans cared about gas prices they would investigate suppliers for price collusion. This is what happens when oil companies run your government.
1203 2018-11-09 21:57:33 How is this good news? To avoid environmental catastrophe oil and gas needs to remain in the ground
1204 2018-11-09 21:57:17 Quick start by Saskatoon 1-0 in the first minute.
1205 2018-11-09 21:57:13 Been in Santa Rosa neighborhoods nestled against the hills & they were absolutely beautiful with all the plantings (often Mediterranean with high oil content). Unfortunately no break between them & the natural vegetation behind them (also with high oil content, e.g., olive trees)
1206 2018-11-09 21:57:06 You have to think of this as two different buckets. One bucket is made of all revenues that Iran collects inside the country. Its hard currency proceeds are overwhelming from oil, gas and petrochemical. This isn’t in rial. This is the money they use to buy imports.
1207 2018-11-09 21:56:56 To illustrate:  I'm a 52-year-old, affluent, suburban mom with two grown kids who owns my own consulting business.  When I go to WA state for work, I always bring back a little something in my suitcase:  CDB oil for my knee, weed candy for the weekend.
1208 2018-11-09 21:56:48 Last night in Red Dead Redemption 2, I spent half an hour chasing down a snake oil salesman for a $50 bounty, then while I was taunting him in the county lockup, accidentally antagonized the sherriff and ended up in the lockup too. 

Bail paid, $52. Totally worth it.
1209 2018-11-09 21:56:44 The anointing on your life is for the assignment, NOT for entertainment, use the oil wisely!
1210 2018-11-09 21:56:39 SIGNATURE DON'T MATCH.
Executive corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our oil infrastructure!
1211 2018-11-09 21:56:36 $CDEV Mark Pappa from old $EOG Enron Oil & Gas!
1212 2018-11-09 21:56:30 @realDonaldTrump BREAKING: In a MASSIVE loss to President Trump and a victory for environmentalists a federal judge in Montana has halted construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, because the United States government didn't complete a full analysis of its environmental impact
1213 2018-11-09 21:56:25 So now trump gets his wished for cheap oil but loses his #1 energy producer status. His head gonna splode.
1214 2018-11-09 21:56:24 If Saudi's oil reserves deplete before all the children die, I guarantee that the Western world will act! Shocking but true.
1215 2018-11-09 21:56:23 Good read Andy, they have the football we want to see and we have the history none of their cheating or oil money can buy them. Life is a real bitch at times
1216 2018-11-09 21:56:12 And palm oil free, it’s so sad that customers have to actively look and check products too. It should just be a given.
1217 2018-11-09 21:56:09 don't put oil in your ass that's bad for you
1218 2018-11-09 21:56:08 (I was tempted to say ‘in the world’ but then I thought of oil and gas companies…)
1219 2018-11-09 21:56:08 It’s bad because people who work in the oil and gas industry are going to lose jobs, but that’s not to say it’s unfair. The global market is the global market. Can’t have your cake and eat it too...
1220 2018-11-09 21:56:04 I'm growing my shit bro it's easy , coconut oil , castor oil , deep condition every week ... let it bool out.
1221 2018-11-09 21:55:54 Probably someone who sells or used palm oil don’t you think?
1222 2018-11-09 21:55:44 His screaming face mixed with the light oil is excellent...”frightpiping” Has that been done yet? I think so, but not sure.
1223 2018-11-09 21:55:36 Watch front grain spreads. Corn, beans, bean oil, and meal. Happens all the time. One trader flipping back and forth.
1224 2018-11-09 21:55:32 Won't matter sooner when US starts to control the middle East oil , the bully has taken the throne after all.
1225 2018-11-09 21:55:29 Put some lucasoil treatment in it and used higher weight oil we'll see ;)
1226 2018-11-09 21:55:17 Sigdi Too.
Nayab handi wala has his own oil well. 
1227 2018-11-09 21:55:14 We drove from KL to KK. Palm oil all the way with forest left on the outsides by the road to fool the public. Poor orangutans were so confused
1228 2018-11-09 21:55:05 Early morning, #Treasury sellers seemed not eager? Overnight #Asia responded, not added to 3.24% 10y, 3.44% 30y. Foreshadowed unlikely late-day US equity bounce? #Oil futures anticipating verbal intervention?
1229 2018-11-09 21:55:03 No it isn’t. It’s designed so the votes of a minority made of rich oil barrons and sister fuck’n hill folk out weigh everyone else’s.
1230 2018-11-09 21:55:00 Way more deforestation to make way for cattle or for the soy to feed the cattle than for palm oil #InconvenientTruth
1231 2018-11-09 21:54:57 Yaushe zaku soke @ShehuSani bayan waadinka ya kare
1232 2018-11-09 21:54:53 I'm surprised the "UK" Gov haven't found a world ending infectious disease in Scottish oil that can only be stopped by waving a butchers flag over each barrel & Scotland being in the "UK". 
Am I giving them ideas? 
1233 2018-11-09 21:54:49 Decrease in oil import bill due to decreasing oil prices= $3b
Deferred oil payment = $3b
Expected increase in exports to China within this F. year = $1.5b
Expected growth in remittance=1.5b
1234 2018-11-09 21:54:49 Baking used to be how our Mums could fill our lunch boxes, and how we feed guests. Now it is cheaper to buy palm oil biscuits. Fonterra profits. We stop baking. Orangutans lose their families. What a world.
1235 2018-11-09 21:54:40 Must say I am still a bit torn. It's gotten people talking about palm oil and aware of its negative impacts, but a) it's not that simple, of course, and b) watching people being like "wow, go Iceland, I'm definitely gonna shop with you now" is making me wanna puke.
1236 2018-11-09 21:54:39 What about palm oil?
1237 2018-11-09 21:54:37 I haven’t one any of these giveaways sha but I’m still hoping 
My head nor get oil
1238 2018-11-09 21:54:34 Absolutely! Roberto Clemente was #1
1239 2018-11-09 21:54:26 Peter Obi is not like most of your northern governors that'll turn a blind eye when the're killings in his state. 

Security apparatus my foot! 
We have lived in the north 2 see how they turn a blind eye as your brothers riot n kill innocent people.
Conversant my foot
1240 2018-11-09 21:54:25 And lavender oil! It’s likr magic
1241 2018-11-09 21:54:24 Have them find a still shot of “Oil Can” Boyd
1242 2018-11-09 21:54:20 Gonna need some of the anti stretch mark oil stuff.. *Makes a list*
1243 2018-11-09 21:54:17 The GOP still holds the Senate, so we can get judges that don't legislate from the bench like this nutjob has. I hope Trump appeals it. We need oil. Someday, maybe we won't.
1244 2018-11-09 21:54:11 my skin is combination. it gets oily and doesn’t need lotion in the summer. but in the winter, i’ve gotta slather coconut oil on my face right out of the shower and sometimes it’s STILL dry.
1245 2018-11-09 21:54:09 To highlight the devastation that palm oil production is doing to the orangutans habitats. .
1246 2018-11-09 21:54:00 Yes and since my car so big I have to pay for an extra quart of oil 
1247 2018-11-09 21:53:44 Decoy Assortment: Chive bagel chips. Bring out this precious gift. Rich cabernet sauvignon with dried fruit and nut mix, rosemary olive oil
1248 2018-11-09 21:53:39 BREAKING:  In a MASSIVE loss to President Trump and a victory for environmentalists a federal judge in Montana has halted construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, because the United States government didn't complete a full analysis of its environmental impact!

THANK YOU!
1249 2018-11-09 21:53:32 then maybe don’t put it IN your eyes, you crackhead  but no, you’re right. it does make my vision blurry too. but it’s all natural and, bc it’s oil, it takes off makeup v wel. it’s important to wash your face afterwards too. unless you have drier skin
1250 2018-11-09 21:53:31 They just dont want us to know all the oil we dig out deep inside the flat earth is infinite
1251 2018-11-09 21:53:28 Gasoline and oil.....
1252 2018-11-09 21:53:26 Tomatoes, garlic , olive oil, S&P >
1253 2018-11-09 21:53:12 ‘We’ have done nothing to deserve it. The establishment political elite are in the pocket of Saudi Arabian money and oil thus allow this kind of shit because they do not want to upset the rich oil supplying, weapon buying elite Muslims. 
1254 2018-11-09 21:53:05 Sure, we'll be using oil for a while. But where, exactly, is demand growth going to come from?
1255 2018-11-09 21:52:57 @nicolconcilio idk if i missed it but did you ever tell us what cbd oil you use for your pups?
1256 2018-11-09 21:52:54 What's the price point you can immediately infer that it is a blend and not real olive oil based on production costs, etc?
1257 2018-11-09 21:52:44 now what is this tooth whitening system here?   I coconut oil pull works great..
1258 2018-11-09 21:52:43 I want to give myself a hot oil treatment but shampooing and reconditioning my hair sounds so painful right now. I don’t think I could even stand my hair stylist touching my head ATM.
1259 2018-11-09 21:52:42 And in Germany oil prices are rising to insane levels  because of a drought in the last couple months that led to the lowest river levels in years causing oil ships in central europe  to stop or to be filled with a lot less than the usual.
1260 2018-11-09 21:52:28 I hate coming to get my  oil change. They always get me for extra shit I don’t even need
1261 2018-11-09 21:52:27 They would nothing left other than an oil patch after spending 4 billion lol
1262 2018-11-09 21:52:26 You'd resign if you were interested in protecting our Democracy or the Sacredness of the White House.  oil
1263 2018-11-09 21:52:20 Oil's well that ends well
1264 2018-11-09 21:52:14 Alhamdulillah
1265 2018-11-09 21:52:10 @hoggard_tanya Hello dear.  I would strongly suggest you change to a different name.
1266 2018-11-09 21:52:01 Iceland advert is so good but They could stop selling products which have palm oil in at all not jsut their own brand just a thought
1267 2018-11-09 21:51:53 Give me your oil make I light up
1268 2018-11-09 21:51:48 When John Michael Greer wrote THE LONG DESCENT he saw the end of oil causing the destruction of nations. The US might not wait for that event. #failedstate
1269 2018-11-09 21:51:34 And this is leadership? A snake oil salesman, charlatan, and liar....smh
1270 2018-11-09 21:51:26 cut it longways scoop out the seeds lather with oil of choice and spice how u like i just cover mine in d d i i r r t t
1271 2018-11-09 21:51:15 Baba Se anduba fah
1272 2018-11-09 21:51:14 As long as the Russia’s oil profits are up- all is well in the White(Red) House
1273 2018-11-09 21:51:05 “This is sane and I am sane”
1274 2018-11-09 21:50:57 Do you use CBD oil?
1275 2018-11-09 21:50:53 Hey @MapleLeafs, what do you get when you put 25 Devils players and 25 lesbians together?

50 people that don't do dick 

Day 23 and the lame joke are out #ticketsorbust #NeverGiveUp
1276 2018-11-09 21:50:48 Oil dey your head 
1277 2018-11-09 21:50:41 This all should have been set up over 20 years ago. No foresight in this or previous govts. Eastern Canada should be penalized for buying foreign oil. Maybe withhold equalization payments. This US ruling ridiculous they were prob prompted by their govt to keep prices low.#scam
1278 2018-11-09 21:50:41 October marked a reversal for the crude oil market which had rallied sharply for most part of the year, I don't see oil entering the bull market again this year. U.S. benchmark WTI & the global benchmark Brent have struggled for gains as the OPEC cartel & Russia boost production.
1279 2018-11-09 21:50:34 The person who claimed to have invented the internet does not understand how weather works... completely clueless. #AlGore but good at selling snake oil for profit.
1280 2018-11-09 21:50:28 Lavender oil works just the same, cheaper and all you need is a couple of drops a night
1281 2018-11-09 21:50:26 I doubt your ambitions exceed mine unless you imagine a more permanent fate for oil industry CEOs than life in prison, but whatever. Look, with respect, read @SEI_Erickson’s work above.  I think you’re underestimating the value of state support, particularly in the US.
1282 2018-11-09 21:50:23 Me, after working on one oil & gas case and thinking I’m an expert:
 
“So, are you familiar with automatic tank gauges?”

Riley, a petroleum engineer: *looks at me with disgust*
1283 2018-11-09 21:50:20 It was pretty lame. Two levels of courts to go thru now, minimum 2 year delay IMO.  I wonder if Imperial Oil will end up delaying their Aspen project?
1284 2018-11-09 21:50:14 Cronyism in action - its ok for supermarkets to advertise products containing palm oil, but you cant promote bring palm oil free?
1285 2018-11-09 21:50:07 Cannabidiol (CBD) oil is used by some people with chronic pain. #CBDoil may reduce pain, inflammation, and overall discomfort related to a variety of health conditions! #hempheals
1286 2018-11-09 21:50:01 Oil money dictating what UK media report?
1287 2018-11-09 21:49:46 Odd, when the price of oil goes up the price at the pump jumps the next day.
1288 2018-11-09 21:49:35 Midnight Oil
1289 2018-11-09 21:49:10 But seeing the ad was enough for me to search about palm oil products and searching palm oil free products. Isn’t that the main thing?

1292 2018-11-09 21:48:54 Lol
1293 2018-11-09 21:48:42 So glad I get to wait 1:45 to pay $42 to get my oil changed
1294 2018-11-09 21:48:41 @FirestoneAuto  Does it typically take two hours for an oil change?
1295 2018-11-09 21:48:33 A wakeup call ?  These are Trudeau's Globalist freind's who are complicit with the destruction of Canadian oil.Trudeau wants the same,so what is he waking up too ?
1296 2018-11-09 21:48:28 Answer this then if your so joyous. Why does Scotland have to send exports through England. Why 4 years after oil was found did the Scottish stock exchanges get closed and moved the London.
1297 2018-11-09 21:48:18 Clearcast banned the Iceland advert that exposes the environmental destruction for the cultivation of palm oil as “too political”... help me understand just what topics are not political enough, too political, or just politically right? #IcelandAdvert #goldilocks #clearcast
1298 2018-11-09 21:48:17 Oil dey your head
1299 2018-11-09 21:48:00 I'm not an expert, but I would believe it! Amazing contortions going on there, while he tries to scrape off the oil
1300 2018-11-09 21:47:44 Black seed oil daily!
1301 2018-11-09 21:47:42 Indisputably an envrionmental catastrophe but WWF say changing the way we farm palm oil is the solution, not banning it. Their argument, Nicky, not mine
1302 2018-11-09 21:47:40 So what are you saying? Again blinded by hate Trump touting Obama ha
I have friends working the oil fields they only recently came back in 2018 after almost totally falling off for 3-4years prior.
1303 2018-11-09 21:47:39 Normally I hate it when someone gets on a hype I’ve been on for a while but please please make not using palm oil the next big thing, forever.
1304 2018-11-09 21:47:27 In “The End of Alzheimer’s” Dr. Bredesen suggests Exogenous Ketones and MCT Oil to assist with ketosis.
1305 2018-11-09 21:47:27 If your brain is not for decorations, you would've apologized to your father for wasting his money in training you in school. How come a party could not give an oil producing nation one single functional refinary in 16yrs? Wait many are coming up even before the election...
1306 2018-11-09 21:47:25 Easy and delicious,  sautee in olive oil with salt n pepper, add a little honey,  roast!
1307 2018-11-09 21:47:23 Just more proof for me that planets are a method for its star to catch mass amounts of H-atoms and other energy sources Wood, life/oil etc, we don't realize because the process takes billions of years and we think stars are random (volcano) things, And not (BACTERIA) OR (CORAL)
1308 2018-11-09 21:47:21 YES!!  
The advert is very good and everyone should watch it.
Well done @IcelandFoods for talking their palm oil off their shelf’s
1309 2018-11-09 21:47:19 I tend to lose them due to that instal kill oil
1310 2018-11-09 21:47:11 My skin in the summer: an oil slick, acne-city

My skin as soon as the temp is below 40°: sorry, we're out of moisture for the next four months :)))
1311 2018-11-09 21:47:08 Another snake oil solution; just like the current mongrel constitution. Politicians are merely Loud mouths. They are Not the sharpest tools in the box. They ought to leave the task of social engineering to brainy professionals.
1312 2018-11-09 21:47:03 They lurve us so much that they subsidise us apparently. We’re awash with oil, whisky, water, renewables and they still have to fling us a bone. Aye right ye are.

1314 2018-11-09 21:46:53 So many bills and Christmas will not be affordable I hate that we are in dept and have so many bills just fought a eviction notice and have disconnect notices and no Money for oil either life is so hard and I love the holidays I wish I had better times to celebrate for the kids
1315 2018-11-09 21:46:47 A great advert #save our planet #save #orangutans it’s educational and the truth , not political at all . Shame on the people that have banned it . Iceland you should be credited for being a leading example and I think it’s about time all food producers stopped using palm oil
1316 2018-11-09 21:46:35 Shy away from what, I just taught you something maybe just let that settle before you change topics? If Ontario or Quebec isn't buying enough domestic oil for your likings feel free to ask the companies that do that, I believe the answer will be "capitalism"?
1317 2018-11-09 21:46:33 Some sugarpastes ( fondants) contain palm oil 
1318 2018-11-09 21:46:31 Syria does not have that much oil, it's about building a pipeline from Kuwait *through* Syria.
1319 2018-11-09 21:46:23 I've used butter to tan outside when I ran out of tanning oil. It was not a good idea.
1320 2018-11-09 21:46:22 Fresh oil change on the Honda & new rims for the vette. Great week!
1321 2018-11-09 21:46:18 I haven’t done a hot oil treatment in a while. It’s about that time.
1322 2018-11-09 21:46:06 Well I feel better about going out to eat, ordering olives and crusty bread with dipping oil to fill the predicted half hour delay for the meal and getting ... bits of brown bread with oil and balsamic vinegar...  The only crusty bit was the service.  
1323 2018-11-09 21:46:02 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
1324 2018-11-09 21:45:58 In 2000 a bp engineer said the wells would be dry by 2014 and we'd need alternative methods to extract the dregs.  And the wouldnt be cost effective. 2014 brought fracking which they claimed would provide a further 5years supply.   Theres one oil well left at the antarctic.....
1325 2018-11-09 21:45:46 Uncontrolled bribery, corruption, lies and systematic breaking of the rules and laws of the game not newsworthy. Oil money dictating what UK media report?
1326 2018-11-09 21:45:45 There are a ton of non-native Texans that move to Texas to work in the oil fields in west Texas
1327 2018-11-09 21:45:43 Houthies are stealing Yemeni food, banks , 4 telecommunication companies income , tax income , custom income , Yemen family income. Houthies now they are the only business people , they control the oil supply to the country and they raise the price 400 % before they enter Sana’a.
1328 2018-11-09 21:45:25 gettin my oil changed... guy said oh cool is it the sleek Black Lexus outside... was too embarrassed to say its the musty 2005 corolla w three (3) hubcaps... might end up payin for someone elses oil change xx
1329 2018-11-09 21:45:17 plz bring back a case of the spicy hot tomato oil
1330 2018-11-09 21:45:07 I hope it's true. I also hope they take his hair oil away. That  mess could be used to "slip between the bars", and it looks like a fire hazard.
1331 2018-11-09 21:45:05 I took my car to get its first oil change this morning, and all the dudes at the dealership complemented my pink fuzzy steering wheel 
1332 2018-11-09 21:45:00 I bought an oil heater off of Amazon which it seems  Amazon took to mean I was starting an extensive oil heater collection
1333 2018-11-09 21:44:59 So now everyone’s mad about the Iceland advert are you gonna stop buying things with palm oil in or
1334 2018-11-09 21:44:58 This peppermint oil feels good on my scalp 
1335 2018-11-09 21:44:49 Yea at night, so usually after I cleanse my face I dilute a bit of tea tree oil with water (sometimes I don’t but use very little) and pat it on the areas where I get the most acne
1336 2018-11-09 21:44:45 My family became really interested in it after I gave my sister thieves oil that cleared her tooth infection. It’s well worth doing a little research on them, and you’re welcome, I’m happy I could help. Feel free to inquire anytime, I’d be glad to assist.
1337 2018-11-09 21:44:44 @Clearcast how many of your directors have shares in palm oil companies???????
1338 2018-11-09 21:44:42 It was so fun!
1339 2018-11-09 21:44:39 CBI would have it. All Iran’s oil revenue (theoretically) world wide is deposited in CBI accounts. That is per Iranian law.
1340 2018-11-09 21:44:37 Palm oil is in absolutely everything and the natives cut down the palm trees and take the land that the orangutans have lived on since time began .
1341 2018-11-09 21:44:32 She REALLY thinks the price of oil depends on the minimum wage when most of the oil we consume in America is imported from countries unaffected by our wages. Like... take a high school economics class lol
1342 2018-11-09 21:44:22 Oil on the Falklands too, we'll take Argentina and shut their pie holes for good, and rename it Anglotina.
1343 2018-11-09 21:44:20 Major hat tip to @IcelandFoods, palm oil as biofuel has led to vast deforestation in pursuit of low carbon fuel. Narrow obsession with reducing co2 instead of increasing biodiversity has been incredibly damaging.
1344 2018-11-09 21:44:13 #WTI #oilprice #oil might be in the longest losing streaks on daily basis but not on weekly basis might be the silver lining for oil to rebound ahead of weekly upward trend channel support at $58 followed by $55 will be GOOD BUY (hope not GOOD BYE!) zone #UCO $22?
1345 2018-11-09 21:44:05 I feel responsible I went and got my oil changed and tires rotated without being told to 
1346 2018-11-09 21:44:03 GOOD NEWS FOR CONSUMERS. 

Oil prices fell nearly 1 percent as global supply increased and investors worried demand growth could slow, pressuring U.S. crude to its longest stretch of daily declines since 1984.
1347 2018-11-09 21:43:56 "If data is the new oil, geographic data science is the new refinery"... good to fuel up (couldn't resist) with @darribas & great case studies.  Coffee by @FarberSteven ;)  @IntersectionsUT @geo_uoft
1348 2018-11-09 21:43:55 Thick as thieves. What a DOJ and judiciary! It’s almost like putting an oil and gas guy in charge of the EPA. Oh they did that. Destruction of US is ongoing.
1349 2018-11-09 21:43:55 I never knw twitter can be so sweet and sour like this...
1350 2018-11-09 21:43:48 I need an inspection, new tires, an oil change, two light bulbs replaced and my starter checked. I really hate car maintenance.
1351 2018-11-09 21:43:47 Probably secret oil cunts too 
1352 2018-11-09 21:43:27 I don't need Gov @elrufai to tell me , I was a well I formed adult conversant with news, media and I knew people who fell victims.
What are the security apparatus of the state for, if a Nigerian can not willfully live where he wants without bn profiled and deported???
1353 2018-11-09 21:43:27 Getting this oil change before work so i can get it out the way.
1354 2018-11-09 21:43:19 @mymonq makes portable essential oil diffusers, they’re kinda expensive but kinda cool
1355 2018-11-09 21:43:14 Should we as humans stop interfering by not cleaning plastic pollution of the sea or oil spills then?  Distasteful as it is, artificially raised fox numbers are as much a result of our mismanagement of the environment as other issues.
1356 2018-11-09 21:43:03 Why not commandeer unused or unwanted oil platforms as bases for our navy for border patrols&training etc thatd be the east coast covered not sure how many platforms there are down south but the channels not massive so several bases dotted about&patrols floating about casually
1357 2018-11-09 21:43:02 esp since how much influence he has on the state department. I guess we got to brace for another 10 years of “neutrality” despite 2+2 and COMCASA. Unless our GDP grown 8 + in those years and the oil price stays low- we are screwed
1358 2018-11-09 21:42:58 All this does is hurt Canada, the oil sands need to be cleaned up and this is the most economical way to do it, the pipeline is the best option for getting the oil to market. The judge is a political ding bat
1359 2018-11-09 21:42:57 Be careful on this point. Yes maybe Iran’s oil sales as a percentage of REVENUE is not 70 or 80%. Fine. But oil, gas and petrochemical sales do account for 70% of Iran’s HARD CURRENCY, which they use for purchasing imports. What they collect in rials at home is different
1360 2018-11-09 21:42:48 Walking around world market and I saw an olive oil bottle and thought it was jager 
1361 2018-11-09 21:42:44 Math can suck my nuts LOL
1362 2018-11-09 21:42:39 It hurts all the provinces that invested in Alberta and all provinces that have oil. We are talking about western Canada. Don’t worry we are all pissed.
1363 2018-11-09 21:42:34 Very nicely done. Palm oil is one of the hardest consumer issues because products that contain it aren't easily labeled.
I don't use shampoo though so i'm safe there
1364 2018-11-09 21:42:30 I had to do a project on palm oil in college and it opened my eyes to how replaceable of an ingredient it is and what's happening in the rainforests lrt, what a good advert :( it definitely made me more mindful of ingredients, it's hard to avoid, but Google cleaning alternatives
1365 2018-11-09 21:42:29 My friends little girl was born very poorly., She wasn't expected to live long, he went through alternative medicines, "THC oil" doctors couldn't believe it, she's 6 now, fully fit like it never happened, it's amazing,. The info is out their .
1366 2018-11-09 21:42:09 I have a little bit of scaring and used bio oil on my face (it’s made for fading scars) it worked pretty well for me. Kind of pricey for a bottle but It lasts forever and I can tell a difference from using it.
1367 2018-11-09 21:42:02 And, as unexciting as it sounds, insulate and caulk. The less energy (heat or AC) your house uses, the less coal, oil and gas are burned. Use LEDs. #ClimateAction #SaveMoneySaveEnergySaveThePlanet
1368 2018-11-09 21:42:00 Of course ? Who else is gonna protect us when some oil is found

1371 2018-11-09 21:41:46 I salute Iceland for standing up for those without a voice,  I feel my faith in some of humanity is being restored. I will support Iceland by switching my shopping to them, for removing palm oil from there products. I hope this is the start all others can follow.
1372 2018-11-09 21:41:44 Trump is a human wrecking ball! Never in my life did I ever think that the country would be so misguided, misinformed that they would fall for a snake oil salesman like Donald Trump!

1405 2018-11-09 21:38:51 Ok but let’s be clear, oil, gas and petrochemical sales account for at least 70% of Iran’s hard currency. Yes that is different from revenue. But they collect revenue inside Iran in rials. Its the hard currency they use to pay for imports.
1406 2018-11-09 21:38:50 I’m struggling to see this as reasonable. Is palm oil really a political issue? Mind you, if it was a pro-fracking Xmas ad, eg, would we react differently??
1407 2018-11-09 21:38:41 Me too. I have no problems with coconut oil.
1408 2018-11-09 21:38:27 @hasanminhaj Just saw that you're going to do an oil episode. I'd really love to hear more about putting pressure on industries that use petroleum products rather than making us keep it in the ground. As long as the demand is there, we're still going to produce oil.

Thus, we have the fighting.

1459 2018-11-09 21:33:24 Everyone has their reasons, but i don’t understand the objection to pipelines. The oil is already delivered to the gulf coast. It gets there by Rail, and truck.  Which is incredibly expensive, and infinitely more dangerous to the environment.

1473 2018-11-09 21:32:07 that's a really good question and could be applied to other aspects of policy like the Bank of Canada interest rate setting. It's happened before that when the oil and gas industry is in recession the rest of Canada is doing well. No easy answers.
1474 2018-11-09 21:31:54 In what I thought would be the last field season of my PhD, my experiment was wiped by an oil spill in the marina. Data-less summer. Fortunately, it gave me the freedom to redesign a much more meaningful final experiment.

1499 2018-11-09 21:28:19 Pretty shocking how d*mb people like you are. Every time I read such garbage I cut down a tree, tip some oil in a river and rev my car for an hour.
1500 2018-11-09 21:28:16 If any nation can survive without Uncle Sam then it’s a miracle look at #iran how much pressure uncle sams has in #Iran with oil -What has got? #KhadimHussainRizvi & FAZLU
1501 2018-11-09 21:28:09 I'd buy a snake oil calendar. ;)
1502 2018-11-09 21:28:08 Flu Shots are snake oil
1503 2018-11-09 21:28:07 Now, there's an idea for an epic adventure. Could feature musical numbers, such as "Me and my electrodes" and "The oil bath skiffle". Instant classics!!!
1504 2018-11-09 21:27:55 BABY OIL! put some on his head and startbrushing gently
1505 2018-11-09 21:27:48 I’m getting my oil changed, and the clerk and I are alone in the office.  He’s telling me how much he loves Trump, what a great job he’s doing and what a good man he is.  Someone help me!!
1506 2018-11-09 21:27:39 Me: I softened it by rubbing a lot of mink oil on it and working it in deep with my fingers.

Him: Your ball glove?

Me: Um, sure. {glancing down} Let's go with that.
1507 2018-11-09 21:27:35 So everybody seems to be loving Iceland because of an advert highlighting the problems with palm oil. Let us not forget that Iceland profits from selling cheap, factory farmed meat. 
These farming methods are a threat to all life on this planet. #IcelandAdvert
1508 2018-11-09 21:27:34 It is not the Brazilian government killing indigenous peoples it is terrorists often funded by oil, tea and coffee concerns.
1509 2018-11-09 21:27:33 letting oil paints ur
1510 2018-11-09 21:27:12 Took the 15 in for oil Chaya do tire rotation, didn’t want to sit in the waiting area, walked onto the lot and spotted a 17 with Alaskan package.  That was an expensive service trip. 
1511 2018-11-09 21:26:55 my pleasure :)
1512 2018-11-09 21:26:55 Dont fall for the snake oil folks they got caught so now its time to deflect pass blame & get out the paid protesters.
1513 2018-11-09 21:26:48 Also butter, lard, tallow, coconut oil.
1514 2018-11-09 21:26:47 I really love cocoa butter and the palmers skin therapy oil
1515 2018-11-09 21:26:44 olive oil                                 joshua hong

1516 2018-11-09 21:26:37 My Uber told me I was horrible for fracking for oil lol!!!!
1517 2018-11-09 21:26:28 Oil is traded in dollars, one has to fall to make up the difference...
1518 2018-11-09 21:26:27 But who's going to clean up the oil slick?
1519 2018-11-09 21:26:26 Elected government? First of all Iran has nothing to do with all of what happened to the government, secondly people in Yemen overthrow their government because they were lying and raised the price of oil
1520 2018-11-09 21:26:09 Excedrin, caffeine, pepermint oil on your temples. Sniffing rubbing alcohol
1521 2018-11-09 21:26:03 Another judge wants us to be dependent on foreign oil so we can sponsor more terrorism!!!
1522 2018-11-09 21:26:00 I dont know how to respond to that. How about the forcefully impregnated cows that never get to feed their child with the milk that is produced for them aftr calf gets pulls away from its mother to give a human child milk for a bowl of cereal?Changes like the palm oil is welcomed
1523 2018-11-09 21:25:59 I’m shocked my car didn’t blow up Bc I didn’t have any oil in it 
1524 2018-11-09 21:25:58 Spent the last half hour looking through @IcelandFoods website thanks to this advert. It’s definitely worked. Didn’t realise they did so much to protect the environment. Palm oil free by 2018 and Plastic free by 2023  #PalmOilAlarmCall
1525 2018-11-09 21:25:41 Yeah it’s been a bitch to get an oil change... I have been on Groupon getting deals lol
1526 2018-11-09 21:25:39 I absolutely love your BL assessments Sara! You're doing us a public service. Morrison is the ultimate snake oil salesman. But we're not buying it, we don't need snake oil
1527 2018-11-09 21:25:31 Maybe Iceland should provide a better vegan range it has improved in the last month but two freezers instead of one is clearly still not enough palm oil is in so many products it would close them down to remove it from there or any store small steps it's time to change.
1528 2018-11-09 21:25:22 How about buying presents with no palm oil in them? #rangtan
1529 2018-11-09 21:25:17 Despite a 200 point Dow decline today it was a strong week for the major indices.
For the week:
Dow +2.8%
S&P 500 +2.1%
NASDAQ +.7%
Russell +.1%
Oil -5%
Gold -2.1%
1530 2018-11-09 21:25:17 finally home, got my oil changed, saw some old coworkers & now i’m cold and ready for a long ass bath.
1531 2018-11-09 21:24:57 My dad said he bought me a present... i go see its a 5litre bottle of olive oil. Lowkey i love it.
1532 2018-11-09 21:24:56 aaah! I reversed the radio car into a bollard on Day 2 at @BBCDerby ... several months later, I think I put oil in the coolant bit of the engine too. Glad it's not just me (FYI, also not sacked)
1533 2018-11-09 21:24:52 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1534 2018-11-09 21:24:43 Thank you 
1535 2018-11-09 21:24:21 I feel your pain.. Happens to me often.. Try CBD oil..
1536 2018-11-09 21:24:12 Jin texted me and said they've been putting castor oil on the back of taehyungs head while hes sleeping so his mullet will grow back faster
1537 2018-11-09 21:24:08 Finally dapat jgak ak nk pgi oil rig kt offshore
1538 2018-11-09 21:24:08 Funny then how in the past  when some oil rich states  elect radical leaders who have tried to nationalise their oil and use that wealth to build their country for the good of their people the USA steams in and replaces them with puppet regimes
1539 2018-11-09 21:23:58 You didn't upset me but now I'm concerned in case I upset anyone. xxx
1540 2018-11-09 21:23:52 $OIL

The biggest joke in the world today
1541 2018-11-09 21:23:48 Sitting at Preferred in the waiting room during my oil change and listening to a customer fight with an associate on the other side of the lobby wall... he is rather loud and angry  #thisissoawkward
1542 2018-11-09 21:23:45 I still use my belly oil I got when I was pregnant it makes my skin so soft and has helped with preventing any stretch marks
1543 2018-11-09 21:23:36 Oil is the most traded commodities in the world (1.8 T USD per annum) unlike natgas (390B USD) & Gold (160B).
Which is why oil dictatorship isn’t just stable but strong.
1544 2018-11-09 21:23:27 Oh! Update on 2 months of coconut oil! No change! So I dunno if its working or not but nothing different or at least not that I can tell. =\
1545 2018-11-09 21:23:17 Two days ago, this surge. Today, free fall over oil.  For 90% of Americans, who cannot and will not ever be able to afford to "play" in the stock market, it means absolutely nothing, really. Here's to investing in real estate for retirement...the only sure thing.
1546 2018-11-09 21:23:17 Uk oil right now.
1547 2018-11-09 21:23:16 Anyone into sample collection in an oil field in Nigeria ?
1548 2018-11-09 21:23:12 Wow.  No to palm oil.
1549 2018-11-09 21:23:08 Oil worst since 1984-and i am telling you while we could have a bounce it ain't over and we may have seen the peak in this inflation cycle just when the fed is slamming the brakes!
1550 2018-11-09 21:23:05 #IcelandAdvert 
Well done to Iceland for bringing the subject of palm oil to the notice of people....it is something that should already have been stopped....been going on for years...the local governments and the big corporations should be ashamed and be boycotted 
1551 2018-11-09 21:22:39 Well done Iceland for raising awareness of palm oil's adverse environmental impact. WWF have a useful palmoilscorecard for companies. Everyone should take a look to know what they are buying.
1552 2018-11-09 21:22:37 Not a problem, I’ve bought some in the past as a gift for my sister-in-law & she said it’s the best oil she’s ever used.
1553 2018-11-09 21:22:26 Why are so many of these freaks 'power of positive thinking' snake oil salesmen?
1554 2018-11-09 21:22:26 Aww! What a good doggo. 
1555 2018-11-09 21:22:25 Can’t believe they won’t run this advert. Showed my 9 year old. It’s clearly a disgusting money driven decision. Why doesn’t government put a high tax on palm oil products? They are also afraid. What will it take b4 we wake up and leave the rainforest alone?
1556 2018-11-09 21:22:20 Dow logs triple-digit loss amid oil swoon
1557 2018-11-09 21:22:10 @business #WhatdYouMiss @CarolineHydetv #JoeWeisenthal: #JanStuart dont know what he's talking about. I told u a long time ago about the abundance of new oil out there from shale, oil sands, & deep water drilling.
1558 2018-11-09 21:22:10 Wonder how many people sharing this ad actually avoid palm oil. As long as you do from now on is the point I guess  #IcelandAdvert
1559 2018-11-09 21:21:53 Dow falls 202 points but still has its best week since March. U.S. oil prices are on their longest losing streak since 1984. GE falls to nine-year low following analyst's ominous warning. BU-81FR
1560 2018-11-09 21:21:51 Please do something on the "save the theater from the evil oil tycoon by putting on one last show" cliché. My campaign to expose The Muppets (2011) as a carbon copy of The Country Bears movie has been less than fruitful.
1561 2018-11-09 21:21:48 きょうは新しくでかいの描き始めて、(oil ground初) お腹がすいてchipotleをおもいっきり食べ、シアワセの頂点、雨が降っていますけど雨の日の絵を描いているので
1562 2018-11-09 21:21:47 And here’s the key ‘hot potato’ WWF quote in which they dismiss Iceland’s ban as irrelevant.
“One of the challenges of banning palm oil is you end up substituting it with another oil crop that could require up to nine times the amount of land to produce the same volume of oil (1)
1563 2018-11-09 21:21:27 Cbd oil
1564 2018-11-09 21:21:26 Low skilled workers  laid off because of construction ending or increase automation.  Need a lot fewer people to watch dials these days.  Same as the reduction in drilling starts need fewer holes to find oil.
1565 2018-11-09 21:20:59 CBD oil! Or valerian root. If you’re looking for a non-medicinal approach, yoga or excerise in General helps me.
1566 2018-11-09 21:20:57 ... because more corporations willingly sell palm oil products and pay more money
1567 2018-11-09 21:20:48 And yet, hurricanes have not increased. The last 20 years show a slowing vis a vis the 100 years prior. That is a fact, and I’m sure if I were so inclined I would find the same data on ‘fires’. By the way, you didn’t answer why mr gore took $150 million in oil money. Hypocrisy?
1568 2018-11-09 21:20:48 Hi, earlier in the year we tweeted that People managed very well with Butter, Margarine, Hair Shampoo/Conditioner, Chocolate , yoghurt before Palm Oil & that we should control how we use it. We got bombarded with aggressive tweet from palm oil companies.

1570 2018-11-09 21:20:40 Plus what will the boys might feel now? Instead of arguing we should show them our support. The tour is still on. Lets focus on our praying for our boys and other armys safety. With all this mess, we shouldn't add oil to an already raging fire.
1571 2018-11-09 21:20:27 The farming of palm oil is one of the biggest contributors to deforestation and killing of endangered species like the orangutan. Palm oil is also a major ingredient in Vegan cheese.
1572 2018-11-09 21:19:59 Literally, leave holes in it (or a diss on incompetent people who make multiple punctures before striking oil). Useful to leave a hole in therapeutic LP for eg NPH, post SAH ?communicating hydro, IIH
1573 2018-11-09 21:19:52 I got 1. Trudeau’s is Ottawa senators Melnyk, has no money for his team (). Butts is the assistant coach ( ruined  2 other teams , Ontario). Shitty defence of boarders , and have no “Power play” , yes, OIL.
1574 2018-11-09 21:19:42 I just looked up if my conditioner has palm oil and...it does. Thank you for raising awareness with this campaign.
1575 2018-11-09 21:19:39 Good try but no, oil sands operations remain very profitable.
1576 2018-11-09 21:19:37 Oil based undercoat is the one for that #sadlife
1577 2018-11-09 21:19:29 Oil. Gives it flavor and let's your crunch it easier, instead of just burning it up.
1578 2018-11-09 21:19:18 Well done @IcelandFoods for attempting to get the message about Palm Oil out there, absolute disgrace it is not going to be allowed on TV
1579 2018-11-09 21:19:15 has anyone used cbd oil for anxiety??
1580 2018-11-09 21:19:04 The oil rig association pays more than the teachers union.
1581 2018-11-09 21:19:01 It's amazing your analogy is comparing private business of less than 100 workers to the federal government of a country who makes money from taxes, oil and mineral resources, etc.

This disaster called APC has affected too many people.
1582 2018-11-09 21:19:01 you look marvelous 
1583 2018-11-09 21:18:58 Making serums or grapefruit oil and cypress oil

1588 2018-11-09 21:18:38 Solar > Nuclear > Natural Gas > Oil > Coal > Nothing
1589 2018-11-09 21:18:36 Palm oil is SO much stuff..almost unavoidable and people need to be made aware. We really do have to stop using it or source it more responsibly. It's even in alot of vegan and vegetarian products which just seems hypocritical. This advert should be encouraged not discouraged.
1590 2018-11-09 21:18:24 @helenipike this is great news. If the govt is so worried about climate change why the hell are they continuing to use fossil fuels. It takes a judge to stop the govt from destroying the planet. Oil production should be against the law.
1591 2018-11-09 21:18:20 Well you didn’t need to buy the extra essential oil
1592 2018-11-09 21:18:17 Hey dieuwrine. How to get a beard like yours ? Is there any oil for that ?
(Don't mind the pp, I'm a boy).
1593 2018-11-09 21:18:11 Jakarta, Indonesia – Palm oil suppliers to the world’s largest brands, including Unilever, Nestlé, Colgate-Palmolive and Mondelez, have destroyed an area of rainforest almost twice the size of Singapore in less than 3 years, according to a new investigation by Greenpeace
1594 2018-11-09 21:18:11 Girl WHAT. why didn’t you use oil to break the glue up 
1595 2018-11-09 21:18:05 not saying that the dorohedoro anime has to utilize the same oil animations used in mp100 bc that's A Lot but if they put effort into making stuff as messy as it is in the manga that'd be so nice
1596 2018-11-09 21:17:57 really out here paying 80$ for an oil change
1597 2018-11-09 21:17:48 Lol the hg got a porno on the internet get bashed by whitey. Smh did the whole oil up the ass thing too
1598 2018-11-09 21:17:47 WTI crude oil decline for record 10th straight session.
1599 2018-11-09 21:17:41 Shame.   I love Zomi oil
1600 2018-11-09 21:17:35 We are on the road to Lucas Oil. Let’s make the magic happen. #LCMK2018 #BOA2018
1601 2018-11-09 21:17:27 I'm sure it's totally not got anything to do with the fact that big corporations rely entirely on palm oil industry and that Christmas is used to get people to over-buy all those products. Not at all.
1602 2018-11-09 21:17:24 I love going to get my oil changed.

"Oil change was $27.85"

"Okie Doke...here ya go"

"Well, we also found a few others things your car needed. Total comes to $317.50. Will it be cash or card?"


1603 2018-11-09 21:17:11 Seed oil + (fructose or ethanol) = fatty liver. You can always get a blood test (anylabtestnow) and check your AST/ALT ratio. If that's more than 1, go get an ultrasound.
1604 2018-11-09 21:17:01 We are a relatively modest user of palm oil, nevertheless, we do substitute palm oil with alternatives where appropriate. Best wishes, Carolyn from the Cow & Gate UK team.
1605 2018-11-09 21:16:51 I can see why it was banned.The sentiment is true but it is also rather frightening.Also the use of Palm oil is very controversial.
1606 2018-11-09 21:16:44 The right depends on hundreds of millions from Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers plus Big Oil, Pharmaceuticals, insurance companies, Russian oligarchs and don't forget the NRA and gun lobby money.
1607 2018-11-09 21:16:42 Kimmie's portapotty in Sierra Madre too many people wanted to be around it and "not to be obsequious this won't get you to paris, France that is basedon merit and a thorough reading of Golden Key late at night when the midnight oil from Saudia Arabia land has been "twerked".
1608 2018-11-09 21:16:41 But we can shame.

It's fair to guess that @Unilever, the world's biggest advertiser and a heavy user of palm oil (it's Palmolive, remember?) are one of the companies putting pressue on @Clearcast to ban such ads.

If they're not, I'm sure they'll say so.

1610 2018-11-09 21:16:33 breathing steam always helps me break up congestion when i have a cold, and peppermint oil supposedly helps when it's chest congestion (caveat: i've not had chest congestion stick around for long, luckily, so the combo is untested by me)
1611 2018-11-09 21:16:29 No, sorry. Haven't been in Paradise for ages. The #WoolseyFire area has for the most part vastly different vegetation. Sadly, some of it has a high oil content that helps it survive drought periods. Once both living & working right in Woolsey zone I know what it looks like. :)
1612 2018-11-09 21:16:18 lavender oil is actually so healing
1613 2018-11-09 21:16:15 You are definitely right about doing things 40 years ago. My boss recorded the disappearance of mountain glaciers in the early 1970’s.  Imagine if the trillions spent propping up the oil/car/etc industry. Was spent on clean tech and conservation.
1614 2018-11-09 21:16:11 Clearly all the billion dollar companies and bosses who destroy the rain forrests for the sake of such things as palm oil have put the pressure on to have this ad banned. What is political about informing the general populance about something terrible going on in the world?
1615 2018-11-09 21:16:11 Being “too political” allegedly. Thought palm oil was when you had sweaty hands haha
1616 2018-11-09 21:16:10 Check your Engine oil this morning.
1617 2018-11-09 21:16:09 lavender oil to calm my heart, and soft tissues for my tearful eyes, I know that not every day will be a good day when you're recovering, but today has been difficult and tonight is as blue as a robin's egg. 
1618 2018-11-09 21:15:58 is that cooking oil? 
1619 2018-11-09 21:15:47 We paid to build your roads, we bought your wine and your olive oil. We paid extra for bent bananas and we buy more German cars than any other country, right hand drive ones.
So ... lime from the Italian job. M Caine
1620 2018-11-09 21:15:46 It’s laughable that they pretend to care about palm oil sustainability issues (which are massively complex) while doing absolutely nothing of use. Eg alternatives to palm oil are often less sustainable. Sustainable palm oil certification doesn’t exclude child labour, etc.
1621 2018-11-09 21:15:41 A lot of insecure and gullible people still exist. Same people who bought snake oil 120 years ago or more. The big sciency guys are just liars who act superior. Listen to me, a celebrity! Vaccines create a non-fatal condition.
1622 2018-11-09 21:15:39 New goodies arriving every week here at Hipsta! Check out these amazing new oil burners  - small $18, medium $25, larger $35!! 
Check them out today, open till 5pm 
1623 2018-11-09 21:15:38 Apologies both for causing upset.  I accept my choice of words was ill chosen.
1624 2018-11-09 21:15:29 Disgusted to discover you use Palm oil
1625 2018-11-09 21:15:23 I have a question. Zionist brought Shah of Iran in power. When he nationalized Iranain Oil & started going against them. They installed Khomeini. So are my Iranians brothers really living in Freedom? Or in a Genetically Modified illusion?
1626 2018-11-09 21:15:18 Oil though, of some kind, probably Saudi crude, plus possible sugar. Some people, in America mainly, often add 'jelly', as if peanut butter is not awful enough.
1627 2018-11-09 21:15:11 The only thing that ruin is the other forest are not only came the demand of palm oil, it’s also a demand of other industrial, farming and city development here. 

We just need to control the private company from taking opportunity to destroy the forest
1628 2018-11-09 21:15:07 So my laptop broke on election night, finally got it back and fixed yesterday, and now I can't find my phone bc the battery died. Clearly, I'm gonna have to get some olive oil out and find out if I am cursed.
1629 2018-11-09 21:15:04 I thought all those electric cars are supposed to keep oil prices down. What happened?
1630 2018-11-09 21:15:01 I’ve never used palm oil in my life but I just might cry
1631 2018-11-09 21:14:59 I guess what always made me anxious is that there's a widespread fallacy that secondary equity markets are about providing capital to firms, and that made me assume that at least some supporters of divestment supported it on the basis that it defunds oil production.
1632 2018-11-09 21:14:53 oil free moisture for sensitive skin by neutrogena
1633 2018-11-09 21:14:51 Big deal, Canadian oil is under $20.
1634 2018-11-09 21:14:48 It is a valuable message to get out there and Greenpeace has done a reasonable job at that.

Unfortunately the message is getting a little buried behind the "poor Iceland" positioning. It's starting to look less like "Palm Oil" is the issue and more that "regulation" is.
1635 2018-11-09 21:14:38 When Goldman Sachs makes a Bullish call, investors and traders alike should do the opposite and vice versa. They have been used as Contrarian indicators before,  specially with Oil and MBS. Nothing changed here.
1636 2018-11-09 21:14:32 Trying to avoid anything with Palm oil have to really scan labels
1637 2018-11-09 21:14:30 "Do you guys oil the cart's wheels here?"
"Uhh no?"
"NO?? Ok I'm calling Jeff Bezos"
1638 2018-11-09 21:14:30 Yes, Russ Jones should have been sacked and banned from teaching for life, IMO.  #AbuseOfPower
1639 2018-11-09 21:14:19 Isaiah 61:3
"To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified."
1640 2018-11-09 21:14:14 Keep on sharing this we have to stop using palm oil well done @IcelandFoods
1641 2018-11-09 21:13:57 I recall predictions from last year detailing low oil prices for 10 years, which was a bit fanciful.
1642 2018-11-09 21:13:57 do people use ghee or coconut oil when substituting butter in mac n cheese i am so confused
1643 2018-11-09 21:13:55 How is protecting the planet anything to do with politics when the @IcelandFoods ad is simply informing people of the devastation caused by using palm oil products?
1644 2018-11-09 21:13:52 A Sober Sous-Chef asks if you can sell her an unprepossessing oil painting depicting a bag of dried mushrooms from Wolfstack Docks. It must be Tuesday.
1645 2018-11-09 21:13:51 Spot on-with all the news-this is what Shep and this reporter think is important-this is why the no one believes the media-just all anti-President- what about the economy, the decrease in oil prices, the shenanigans that the Democrats are trying to get away with in the past & now
1646 2018-11-09 21:13:47 For all those who think palm oil is bad, think about the independent small producers which are remnants of the british land grab #iceland
1647 2018-11-09 21:13:41 They are saying that OIL prices have dropped considerably  Question... why am I paying $3.89 per gallon in the Land of Fruit and Nuts???
1648 2018-11-09 21:13:40 Let’s get this oil boy fuck the bag
1649 2018-11-09 21:13:38 Ooh really. U guys running only after oil, opium and trump tower's
1650 2018-11-09 21:13:34 But I had outstanding murphy’s in a boozer in Almaty in Kazakhstan that was owned by the fella that had the Heineken distribution rights in all of Central Asia. He also owned a few oil companies.  Pub was called Mad Murphies and still haunts me.
1651 2018-11-09 21:13:34 clove oil its really good for toothache, tastes nasty though lol you pack it in the hole/tooth
1652 2018-11-09 21:13:28 I feel dumb no matter where I go bc I don’t know what I’m talking about but Superfast Lube and Oil always takes care of me 
1653 2018-11-09 21:13:21 Iceland have had a TV advert banned for displaying a stance against palm oil use and production which is responsible for huge deforestation in Indonesian rainforests... what the fuck is going on on this planet why are we trying to watch it burn in front of our eyes
1654 2018-11-09 21:13:18 Got my tea tree oil going in my oil diffuser. Cleansing everything
1655 2018-11-09 21:13:15 Coconut oil after a shower is life
1656 2018-11-09 21:13:03 I use tea tree oil to a single pimple, or the good old toothpaste. LOL both work like magic. I will try ACV next time too.
1657 2018-11-09 21:13:01 We don't need a polar ice cap!  Once it melts, it will be easy to drill for oil there! #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming
1658 2018-11-09 21:12:58 Then why did the #jumlaParty make promises that they will control Oil prices and give us better economy with #15Lakh in our account, #2crorejobs
Now we only have: #DemonetisationDisaster #pakodaEconomy and #hastyGST

1661 2018-11-09 21:12:50 @dallascowboys Jason Garrett has no idea what to do when things don't go properly. Jerry Jones is an oil man and sales man. Obviously since Jimmy Johnson left he has no idea how to build a winning franchise
1662 2018-11-09 21:12:41 Tesco don't care about anything other than profit, palm oil related or other wise.
1663 2018-11-09 21:12:38 Oil stocks has dropped meaning cheaper gas for all of us . Hopefully oil continues to drop they have had their fill . U.S . Drill baby drill
1664 2018-11-09 21:12:25 They stock a LOT of products that have palm oil in it - so don’t !!
1665 2018-11-09 21:12:24 All I see are tissues 
1666 2018-11-09 21:11:56 @marcuswareing Catching up on your beef dish on Wed Masterchef. Out of interest, why do you use olive oil and a not rapeseed oil?
1667 2018-11-09 21:11:46 I literally had anything pineapple, I took evening primrose oil capsules, got on the gym ball and went for walks up hills. Lincoln was here on his due date, so hopefully does the same for you.Were good thank you. 
1668 2018-11-09 21:11:43 Reason why Alaska is best state:
Gold 
Oil
Salmon
3 types of bears
Most northern and western state
Biggest state by a long shot 
Residents get free money every year
Has the tallest mountain in the Americas
Latest state to (successfully, of course) fight off a foreign invasion
1669 2018-11-09 21:11:39 Getting your oil changed has gotta be top 3 of the most annoying and inconvenient things you HAVE to do. 
1670 2018-11-09 21:11:38 they make me feel stupid...like i am sorry that i’m dumb and don’t know what kind of oil to put in my car but I KNOW that i’m broke so the cheapest and then they look at me like wtf
1671 2018-11-09 21:11:35 This is  beautiful, your nails aren’t horrible, just a little trim and a little oil will have them looking new again.
1672 2018-11-09 21:11:29 Bacon oil would taste better because we all know that the correct way to do a hand job is to use your mouth 
1673 2018-11-09 21:11:23 I want to fry plantain n egg tonite... 
Plz sud i use groundnut oil or i sud ororo  
 
I need Help rn. 
Coz I'm turn apart 
1674 2018-11-09 21:11:21 Orangutan not only loose their home for Palm oil.... but for rubber and other development too.

I don’t see any political side of this ads and it may taken down by private company. For this case, Government did response long time ago by setting up a lots of Protected Forest here
1675 2018-11-09 21:11:19 HAH! "Oil check!"
Glad I never wrestled with guys.
1676 2018-11-09 21:11:16 Abi you say rt for a 'bro' 
1677 2018-11-09 21:11:14 Spot on Mark, it’s incredibly difficult to find biscuits, shower gel etc without palm oil in. None of the big supermarkets are making an effort
1678 2018-11-09 21:11:11 That oil is already coming through just on trains, which spill a lot more.
1679 2018-11-09 21:11:08 Next month on #bbcqt : Lord Spiv of Spanner, explaining why palm oil is a national security issue
1680 2018-11-09 21:11:02 His only concern is making money for shareholders in banks, Canada’s economy is slowing, capital is fleeing south to the 21% corporate rate and we lose 100 million a day in taxable oil exports stuck in the ground. If the economy is roaring it’s only in His and Trudeau’s mind...
1681 2018-11-09 21:11:01 ขอบคุณพวกคุณเหมือนกันนะ ดีใจมาก ๆที่ทำให้พวกคุณได้รับรู้ว่ามีคนยืนข้าง ๆพวกคุณเสมอนะถึงวันนั้นจะแพ้ จะชนะ ก็ยังอยู่ตรงนี้  ถึงทำได้แค่ส่งกำลังใจในนี้ แต่ดีใจมากที่มันไปถึง แล้วเราจะก้าวไปด้วยกันอีกนะ #itcitybacon
1682 2018-11-09 21:10:57 Emergen-c is the only thing that has worked for me but it's also hit or miss

I've also heard oregano oil in boiling water and inhale it for a time works but it's pretty stinky
1683 2018-11-09 21:10:54 Cadbury, Warbatons, most of ASDA, Tesco, Aldi, Lidl, Sainsbury's, Morrisons products and most of the big companies have palm oil in there products. I have been checking packaging for the past few years and you would not believe it is in everything.
1684 2018-11-09 21:10:49 Northern Germany close to Warnemunde and Rostok.  However if stuck in Rostok hospital being patched up for the journey home you miss the trip!
1685 2018-11-09 21:10:48 When in time and what particular moment has Nigeria been considered a developing country? Oil booming not a civilization!  Religious preferences not a solution! Populism not a determined factor who is to elevate Nigeria to that expected ends but neither Atiku nor Buhari 
1686 2018-11-09 21:10:45 Is it 'publicly controversial in the UK' to highlight the plight of orangutans and the destruction of forest to plant palm oil????
1687 2018-11-09 21:10:42 The scars on my arm are fading. I love bio oil. 
1688 2018-11-09 21:10:38 Oil short was the win this week.
1689 2018-11-09 21:10:36 Clove oil/ aka Eugenol oil
1690 2018-11-09 21:10:35 You are one big contradiction @IcelandFoods ... bought a few items from you in September for a party - EVERY single item had palm oil in it! I was horrified.... so explain that one? Have you stopped stocking products that have it in it to justify this advert? #Hyprocrite #PalmOil
1691 2018-11-09 21:10:33 @TeamCavuto crude oil going down put gas prices are going to go up in California because of the liberal nut governor Coke head!
1692 2018-11-09 21:10:32 Wonder how much money the palm oil industry paid advertising standards to ban that Iceland advert 
1693 2018-11-09 21:10:31 Woke up sick. Had to stay home today. Likely had to do with our freezing house, since we ran out of oil last night and I live in Maine. Sucks because I missed rehearsal and that likely won't gel well with other people. #sick #rehearsal #school #Maine #cold
1694 2018-11-09 21:10:20 Tech and oil have collapsed of late, along with weak banks the market here is saying more downside is possible before a end of year rally.  There is still a good chance the market makes an all time high within the next 6 months.
1695 2018-11-09 21:10:20 見回り行ってきまーす！
1696 2018-11-09 21:10:17 There are 2 sides to the argument, for some individuals and countries palm oil has been a financial lifeline.
Anything that could threaten that is therefore political, and rules are rules, but I do agree it's a very powerful advert and kudos to @IcelandFoods for making it.
1697 2018-11-09 21:10:15 I’ve heard that tea tree oil shampoo is worth looking into
1698 2018-11-09 21:10:11 somebody text me a oil change real quick.
1699 2018-11-09 21:10:07 Their trophies were brought with oil money though, so not too different from City  just more of them
1700 2018-11-09 21:10:06 Dump that shit

1704 2018-11-09 21:09:38 And when you think they can't go lower. Honestly, they way @Laurestar @laimohammed124 dig so low, they would soon discover something dipper than oil. Kai, ijebu weed no good.
1705 2018-11-09 21:09:33 Prosecuted in the sense of being dragged before his teaching peers and stripped forever of his ability to appear on the appropriate register, not prosecuted in the sense of the courts which would not do so as Lily was 18.
1706 2018-11-09 21:09:28 Does anyone know why leaders of major food companies simply aren't creating palm oil farms?
1707 2018-11-09 21:09:25 Wait a tic, can I short Oil?
1708 2018-11-09 21:09:13 WWF say Iceland are wrong - focus should be on sustainable palm oil, not alternative oil-based crops which take up more space.
1709 2018-11-09 21:09:11 Who needs torpedoes when you can use bigger ships like oil tankers, just as effective!
1710 2018-11-09 21:08:59 Sounds like someone in the Advertising Standards Agency has shares in palm oil 
1711 2018-11-09 21:08:47 @rustyrockets please can we have a #trews on the fascinating banning of the iceland palm oil advert. Thanks
1712 2018-11-09 21:08:41 Energy/ oil prices falling!
1713 2018-11-09 21:08:29 Right. Slap some tongue oil on those and you're set for years.
1714 2018-11-09 21:08:24 يارب هما ارهبوهم كاعادة
1715 2018-11-09 21:08:20 Deforestation, and palm oil. They don’t just do sugar.
1716 2018-11-09 21:08:19 So a man flipped out and attacked his family inc kids and a 2 month old. Threw hot oil on them. The tv news called it more than once “an argument that got out of hand”.

Maybe language is part of the problem @NBCNewYork?
1717 2018-11-09 21:07:56 No arguments? Wow. Obama was moving this country towards clean energy that would better the eco system by signing the Paris Climate Accord. Trump pulled is out. Trump has stripped funding from the EPA and appointed Pruitt who represented coal and oil. Has rolled back regulations.

1719 2018-11-09 21:07:45 I sort of get what you mean, but if it was the EDL saying palm oil was bad they’d be a very different organisation.
1720 2018-11-09 21:07:42 Great work by @IcelandFoods on their #Christmas advert... A good cause, and a great idea to get rid of palm oil. 

Plus, by getting it banned, they've boosted the reach and reaction 10 fold without having to pay a penny for the pleasure... Very clever business exec's!
1721 2018-11-09 21:07:40 عادى هما بدوء التحفيل 
1722 2018-11-09 21:07:39 Iceland aren't using Palm Oil in their products, that's why they used the ad.
1723 2018-11-09 21:07:28 We can't undo what has been done but we can change how we live now to stop this from happening in the future, every small gesture counts. I stopped using palm oil years ago and actions like this from all of us would ensure Rang-tan's babies have a home. It's really so sad.
1724 2018-11-09 21:07:28 That's good. My sister and I are like water and oil.
1725 2018-11-09 21:07:21 Oil down again today, wholesale price falls below $60, WTI.
1726 2018-11-09 21:07:17 Ekiti
1727 2018-11-09 21:07:16 I do check labels. I’ve given up Nutella, a favourite spread, after many years, because of this. You do have to be thorough, because some products with palm oil call it “vegetable oil.” 
1728 2018-11-09 21:07:06 @updateboyz
1729 2018-11-09 21:07:03 Shannon, you should read some of the comments today on the above subject.. many Canadians feel that we should try to use our own oil instead of buying it from the USA and Saudi Arabia... Please make the PM aware of it... it is so obvious!!!
1730 2018-11-09 21:07:01 This has been a very depressing day:

- Kristallnacht
- Armistice
- Iceland & palm oil
- Natural England CEO resignation.
- Johnson: "a failure of British statecraft unseen since the Suez crisis" 
- (Possibly (more)) toxic air at Rocketdyne facility from CA wildfires.

1732 2018-11-09 21:06:48 Some fellow Oil fans might find this interesting. Bako PP units in yesterday's game:

2nd Unit:
Day-Polei-Currie-Gust-Gambardella (net front)

Coming off the shoulder tweak is the reason Bear not playing PP I assume.

1740 2018-11-09 21:05:54 Hope you enjoyed the play.  What did you see? And chicko rolls can be posh.  Not that you need to be posh, mind you.  Think of them as a spice infused vegetable medley wrapped in cold water pastry and momentarily immersed in virgin olive oil. @murrigellas
1741 2018-11-09 21:05:51 Done
1742 2018-11-09 21:05:50 Francine, your reply “ true dat” made me laugh & remember back to a statement made way back before my time by Huey Long then Governor (want to be dictator) of Louisiana said at the close of one of his snake oil salesman speeches “And folks Dat It.”
1743 2018-11-09 21:05:46 What little was offered in the campaign, not least by (talking of incoherence) your bro, was mostly snake oil and pie in the sky. Proudly, nostalgically denying the UK's frailty here is no answer. You and your ilk might as well be kicking up a fuss in a sand pit. #BrexitShambles
1744 2018-11-09 21:05:42 Snake oil for scamming desperate and/or silly people.
1745 2018-11-09 21:05:40 I hope the City of Calgary  will not create new taxes to carry out the Olympic Games?It would be unfair and I would call it an extortion against the working class.they want Olympic games, look for oil companies, hotels, restaurants, airlines and many more companies etc but not us
1746 2018-11-09 21:05:39 Iranian vessels are trying to evade U.S. sanctions by disabling location transponders used to prevent collisions -- with the goal of making Iran's oil exports harder to track. "This tactic is a maritime security threat"
1747 2018-11-09 21:05:30 The fact is that drug imports needs a lot of money and all oil revenue should be spent for it, but the Islamic Republic more needs military weapons, so it refuses to import drugs. #FakeNews
1748 2018-11-09 21:05:27 Like the Pretend President, Whitaker is nothing more than a sleazy snake oil salesman who will sell his soul to the highest bidder. Resist!
1749 2018-11-09 21:05:19 Its actually stopped at the Canadian border. Besides being the dirtiest oil on the planet, the Canadiens want to run it through the states because it would be cheaper for them to pipe it through here than going over the Canadien Rockies. This oil was not being sold to the US
1750 2018-11-09 21:05:18 Fair play to you for raising awareness of Pam Oil and the issues with it - most people haven’t a clue!
1751 2018-11-09 21:05:12 Just been out for dinner with work friends. One lad ordered vanilla ice cream and put olive oil and salt on it. 

Instantly accused him of being a danger to society but happy to hold my hands up and say that for some reason it tastes exceptional.

1753 2018-11-09 21:04:51 So spare me your histrionics, in fact maybe you ought to study  a little U.S. History before ranting about the Republican Party. The Grand Old Party ( TR) (R) who broke up monopolies, such as Standard Oil.  He also was an ardent Conservationist before it was fashionable.
1754 2018-11-09 21:04:50 #OIL tanking taking down some decent plays with them. I topped my $CJ holding today buying the $3 January calls paying $.44 for them.
1755 2018-11-09 21:04:29 Even better idea use all of the money put into oil and invest it in renewable energy and green research because that is the way of the future not oil
1756 2018-11-09 21:04:26 But this is what happens in Canada.  The oil industry is no different than any other individual, government or corporate entity. Zero accountability and complete lack of personal responsibility. Just like the people that have kids they can't afford, buy houses beyond their means.
1757 2018-11-09 21:04:16 After all major negative narratives on @TeamCavuto market ended down .77% which equals 2 nearly nothing. Just little over month ago talking heads on Cavuto predicting oil per barrel price over $100 oil dropped to 59.87 per barrel. Don't listen 2 these false prophets! @Pinay_MAGA

1770 2018-11-09 21:03:15 Happy #VeteransDay2018. The best way to honor veterans is to stop creating them. In modern times the men and women who are chewed up in the gears of the US war machine are fighting and dying not for freedom and democracy but for crude oil and Raytheon profit margins. End war.

1772 2018-11-09 21:02:54 This has nothing to do with oil Dan, we elected a crazy person with no morals to be President, and now the republicans are taking advantage of it to try an destroy the two party system and America as we know it.
1773 2018-11-09 21:02:49 I need Karen Clark Sheard to come out with another “It’s Not Over” type album. That album had the oil!

1783 2018-11-09 21:01:39 So @IcelandFoods advert was emotional and the issues need addressing.
My question is what are @asda @Tesco @sainsburys & @Morrisons doing to combat the use of palm oil?
1784 2018-11-09 21:01:31 Just got off the phone with a friend in Alberta Oil & Gas. Has what used to be considered an excellent, high paying job at a well known organization, (BXE) he recently took a side gig, not industry related, just in case.

1791 2018-11-09 21:01:07 I think is is amazing what you have done. Exposing the truth. I don’t even know what products contain palm oil which bothers me as I don’t want to buy them
1792 2018-11-09 21:00:47 Is trying to end a quagmire ‘war’ and bring more troops home now being called ‘depleting the military’? Is sending soldiers to suffer & die for wealthy oil oligarchs being patriotic? Driving up deficit by overspending on the military ( space force? Really?) good for economy?
1793 2018-11-09 21:00:32 We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products, Linda. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified. 1/2
1794 2018-11-09 21:00:22 Then I will make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, declares the Lord GOD.

Ezekiel 32:14
1795 2018-11-09 21:00:21 US oil is relatively cheap because of shale’s low cost as well as the US Dollar’s strength, so it is more of an effect than a cause I believe. 

I think this is a very interesting area not many people are talking about.
1796 2018-11-09 21:00:21 We should ban all palm oil product imports now,or pressure the supermarket chains that do so,they are the ones who can really stop the devastating deforestation happening right now.Surely this is not rocket science we’re dealing with, is it?
1797 2018-11-09 21:00:20 Well done for doing the right thing by getting rid of palm oil
1798 2018-11-09 21:00:12 @AliVelshi Oil prices do not change that we need to get off  burning fossil fuels.
1799 2018-11-09 21:00:11 So Iceland are leading the way in terms of environmentalism in our supermarkets. They are removing single use plastic, they are promoting veganism and have removed palm oil. The deserve credit, you don't see others doing it. Meanwhile you're being a synical skeptic.
1800 2018-11-09 20:59:51 Hmm.  It was released knowing it wouldn't be passed.  View the original Greenpeace one rather than being manipulated into advertising this really rather unethical company (yes they're pledging to stop using palm oil in their products, but not necessarily great otherwise).
1801 2018-11-09 20:59:44 Ga kyaw ga kwanya
1802 2018-11-09 20:59:41 this is simply a wealth trnsfr from canadian oil producers/canadian gov't tax revenue to midwest USA refiners while canadian production still grows and gets exported anyway at a discount via far more dangerous and carbon intensive means. environmentalists have accomplished zilch

1807 2018-11-09 20:59:08 On one hand, NL’s energy is like 97% renewable (if we count hydro) and will soon be basically 100%, but like AB, its politicians fail to see a future beyond oil. The same could be said of a lot of federal politicians too.
1808 2018-11-09 20:59:00 It’s an interesting point. I’m asking myself how valid it is to separate the two events? Genuinely removing palm oil is a good thing imo and I’d say raising awareness is also good. Does all that become invalid because of the party political actions of the guy behind it? 
1809 2018-11-09 20:58:58 This is digusting people need to know the truth, businesses are killing orangutans one of the most intelligent species. I don’t even know what contains palm oil so can’t make informed choices. This is outrageous
1810 2018-11-09 20:58:57 Every single one of them! If you Google "humane fish euthanasia" that's what pops up. The most recommended method is clove oil, which, for some reason, is impossibly expensive and hard to get hold of. But after that they recommend hammers and scissors. 
1811 2018-11-09 20:58:50 The club are still collecting the Oil Tokens so if anyone is purchasing fuel with McCaugheys of Clones please ensure that you pick up a token for the club gear.
1812 2018-11-09 20:58:37 I'm sure they must have seen it on the radar. Then it suddenly veered in front of them, in the unpredictable manner common to all 60,000 ton oil tankers... wait, what?
1813 2018-11-09 20:58:32 & what UPA did? issued 1.50 lakh crores of oil bonds.who wld have paid these amounts with Intrest after 5 yrs. Papu ki mummy deti ya fir Jija jee.

1815 2018-11-09 20:58:19 Considering the oil companies involved already said the oil is going overseas after being processed in Texas and other places, it's not going to save the United States people anything. There is already an oil glut in a world with prices now below $60 a barrel
1816 2018-11-09 20:58:17 I can't see how it's political. Boycott palm oil products.

1818 2018-11-09 20:58:10 Truely. If there is one thing that has come out of this with any positives it’s the fact that Iceland won’t have any palm oil products.
1819 2018-11-09 20:58:10 Have fun walking everywhere in you bare feet... stay off my paved roads, never fly anywhere... give up your computer, your cell phone and everything else uses oil products to make... or perhaps educate yourself!
1820 2018-11-09 20:58:09 Thank you for replying April. The problem is that many palm oil producers engage in corruption and deception to shield the true extent of deforestation and membership of such organisations only legitimises that practice. It’s better to avoid palm oil altogether.
1821 2018-11-09 20:58:02 The "oil check" is the prelude to the "dirty Sanchez-mechanic", and Brad knows this.
1822 2018-11-09 20:57:52 It’s wasn’t approved due to its a political nature, not allowed in advertising. Palm Oil is more complex than it looks!
1823 2018-11-09 20:57:48 We could make believe we live in the USSR, I'm KGB, and democrats are headed for the Siberian gulag to lay oil pipelines? @BethLynch2020
1824 2018-11-09 20:57:44 Thanks, I have always focused on the intricate background details with my oil paintings, it gives them more of a personalized feeling. In this painting I was given separate images of the cat, the headboard and blanket to blend together. All were special to the recipient. :-)
1825 2018-11-09 20:57:42 THEY'RE AN OKAY TREAT JUST TAKE FISH OIL IF U HAVE ONE
1826 2018-11-09 20:57:39 Superb advert, best I've seen in a long time & love the message. Not political at all. Very lame excuse. Vested interests at play. Someone must have lots invested in palm oil.
1827 2018-11-09 20:57:34 not crazy about whale policy, but there is a LOT else to love about Iceland!! We need  what products do and don't use palm oil to be WIDELY known!
1828 2018-11-09 20:57:21 Right! I hate when people do that and talk about how cats are trash compared to dogs. Why can't we all except that cats and dogs are both fuzzballs filled with joy
1829 2018-11-09 20:57:19 The S&P 500 fell steadily on Friday and deepened its losses as the day wore  on with shares of large technology, industrial and material companies taking a  hit after weak Chinese data and a slide in oil prices raised concerns about  global growth.

1844 2018-11-09 20:56:24 So why is palm oil in so many things? By example, Is there a margarine/vegetable spread that doesn’t have it as an ingredient? #letsbuyalternatives #savetheplanet
1845 2018-11-09 20:56:24 That is true. The only reason the Canadiens want to have keystone come thru the states is because it would cost them to much money for them to run the pipeline over the Canadien Rockies. This oil was not going to us. Plus it's the dirtiest oil on the planet
1846 2018-11-09 20:56:20 National security for who? Not us citizens. This is the most frightening time I've lived through. Born early 1970's. + the most restrictive time religiously. Only ones gaining anything are those at the top, the 6 oil corporations that bought the media & pay politicians/judges.GB
1847 2018-11-09 20:56:19 It wasn't Iceland who banned their own advert, it was Clearcast, the body responsible for vetting adverts before they're shown on TV. I'm not a fan of Iceland but do think more should be following their 'no to palm oil' decision.
1848 2018-11-09 20:56:15 This is a HUGE problem. Dealing with it in my own family. AND you can easlily buy cannabis oil for these vape/Juul devices. Really difficult for parents to PARENT their kids when these things are everywhere and marketed to kids
1849 2018-11-09 20:56:09 Watch out for secret palm oil ..
1850 2018-11-09 20:55:54 Maybe because they have done nothing to advance society in the last 12-1300 years? Everyone from the Saudi oil freaks chopping up Muslim Brotherhood reporters all the way down to the savages burning Christians in the dog kennel that are also crucifying children and all in between
1851 2018-11-09 20:55:53 Well I'd suggest we invest carbon tax revenues into buying and expanding oil pipelines BUT GUESS WHAT
1852 2018-11-09 20:55:45 just the meat, it'll produce it's own oil which you should drain...
1853 2018-11-09 20:55:37 Retweet, share make people aware of Iceland's toil to ban palm oil.
1854 2018-11-09 20:55:21 try some peppermint oil in a bowl of very hot/boiled water? use a towel over your head to help trap the steam, and breath in the steam.

1859 2018-11-09 20:55:01 You should know that palm oil is making a lot of wealthy Malaysians even wealthier. If this income stream is threatened then so is the Govt - the govt that spends an lot of money on British weaponry and various nasty 'law enforcement' stuff. Any valuable resource is 'political'.

1871 2018-11-09 20:53:39 ... Ever likely to reach on TV (i.e. those taking any bloody notice) 

It's also got a great deal many people talking about the issue, especially those who were unaware of the palm oil issue and displacement of species such as orangutans etc...

1887 2018-11-09 20:52:20 Some say that because palm so productive, to replace palm oil with alternative needs 3x the land for olives/rape etc. We need to revert to not using any of these crops so universally.

1892 2018-11-09 20:51:43 I'm guessing the oil tanker crept up on them.

After all, it's not as if a frigate is going to need high-quality equipment to detect other vessels or anything 
1893 2018-11-09 20:51:37 That won't save the forest will it? Of course I'm not going to bin them, but I certainly won't be buying any more of them. Surprised at some products actually highlight being palm oil free

1895 2018-11-09 20:51:32 Sameeee, Maddie is literally my best friend and I've had her since I was 6 so I don't remember much without her.
1896 2018-11-09 20:51:30 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using salt and olive oil.
1897 2018-11-09 20:51:22 I gotta get an oil change this weekend.
1898 2018-11-09 20:51:15 #s don’t tell full story of how bad last year.  And Kosk huge step up as alternative.  Oil out of race today if G as bad as last yr.  but must be better for offseason run.
1899 2018-11-09 20:51:07 I love how we are even still talking about oil. Remember the crazy hippie leftists in the 70s who said we would be out of oil by now. How did they not lose all credibility from that totally fraudulent predictions ?
1900 2018-11-09 20:51:02 8 percent
1901 2018-11-09 20:51:00 And, u wldn't even consider the fact that the price of oil, which accounts for the major source of revenue for the govt, also started appreciating close to "election period"? The best time to hav done this was a long time ago, the 2nd best time is now, & still better than never.
1902 2018-11-09 20:50:57 I took children on a school trip there when I worked in Miri. Very sad that this is happening. Flying over Borneo you can see oil palm plantations for miles where natural habitats used to be :-(
1903 2018-11-09 20:50:50 My whole family is boycotting Nutella and all Ferrero products since 1,5 years. School is doing a fantastic job to show them the ugly reality of palm oil
1904 2018-11-09 20:50:49 Bio oil for for sex or?
1905 2018-11-09 20:50:44 You are clearly not educated. It not an opinion, it is a fact. It is self-evident that Republicans want to make America like Venezuela. With their oil is what caused them to crashed not their taxes. Democrats are not making America like the EU. That happened because they accepted
1906 2018-11-09 20:50:33 ONE NIGERIA THE ZOO NATION, AS "PRINCE CHARCE" BYCCOTT THE BIAFRA OIL PRODUCING STATES & CONNIVED WITH NORTHERN & WESTERN UNEDUCATED MISCREANTS, AS THEY CUT & RULES WITHOUT APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT. @PRINCE MADU.
1907 2018-11-09 20:50:30 China’s GDP growth dropping below 6.0% will be a problem for oil prices.
1908 2018-11-09 20:50:30 Today I learned that there is a wrestling move called the "oil check" where you stick your finger in your opponent's bum hole to make him lose his position so you wanna tell me again how sports aren't homoerotic, Brad
1909 2018-11-09 20:50:21 If anyone needs another reason to shop at @IcelandFoods aside from their palm oil policy, y’all need to try the #breadboard beer brewed by @tinyrebelbrewco AND it’s donated to a beach clean charity! It’s so tasty!
1910 2018-11-09 20:50:18 The pixi glow tonic is good! But it's an exfoliator so it's a good idea to put a moisturizer or a night oil on afterward. I'm a fan of the Sunday Riley Luna Sleeping Night Oil. I also use squalene rose oil at night. And a snow mushroom serum. And eye cream. But I'm 41 
1911 2018-11-09 20:50:13 No but the U of A connections run deep in the Oilers. I’m guessing Ian Herbers had a hand in bringing him in.. He also worked for the Oil Kings when Bob Green and Griffin Reinhart were there, so there’s that too.
1912 2018-11-09 20:49:37 this isn't political this is true! sad true, the population of oranguntans on Borneo decreased about 100 000 in the last 20 years. now they fight for surviving against the paper & food (palm oil) industry. btw, palm oil is shit, it's everywhere & has a bad impact on our health 
1913 2018-11-09 20:49:31 Your cats so cute oh my gosh 
1914 2018-11-09 20:49:29 if i break your heart, baby that is a national crisis. i consider that oil spillage. DAMN
1915 2018-11-09 20:49:22 It's because of the US oil prices are so low, market access will do little to help Canada's oil industry. Quit partisan finger pointing and do some research.
1916 2018-11-09 20:49:13 Any oil tonight?
1917 2018-11-09 20:49:07 Politics.
Sound good, doesn't it?
Electric cars, clean, no pollution.
Where do you think the electricity to charge them come from?
Power stations.
What do they do?
Burn coal/oil, etc. Merely displaces the pollution from towns to somewhere else.
You can't get owt, for nowt.

1921 2018-11-09 20:48:59 Why do humans cause so much damage & heartache?Well done @iceland I only hope @Tesco @asda @sainsburys @Morrisons et so follow your beautiful example and ban palm oil from their products too I’ll be putting your products on my shopping lists from now on #BanPalmOil
1922 2018-11-09 20:48:57 If you no sabiiiiiiiii ,  you should  go sabiiiiiiiii
1923 2018-11-09 20:48:55 @Clearcast you shower of cunts. You can obviously reverse my opinion by banning any advert in future from the political parties in the uk, companies that use palm oil ( this includes the big 4 uk supermarkets) and any agency that has an agenda. Good luck
1924 2018-11-09 20:48:51 People probably think I’m homeless & shit with my backpack on & dress homeless walking to chipotle lol but I’m waiting for my oil to be change 
1925 2018-11-09 20:48:51 Wow, I see no love or support for you or Jim Acosta based on the replies to your tweet. Seems to have back fired.

1927 2018-11-09 20:48:44 Guess we'll never know. 
More palm oil?
1928 2018-11-09 20:48:42 That stuff ain't cheap! And it's made with petro so when oil prices go, vinyl prices go up too!
1929 2018-11-09 20:48:36 I’m shining in coconut oil. Did you just say you use conditioner instead of lotion? You truly a nasty one.

1947 2018-11-09 20:46:47 See I feel like the vitimin e oil gave me hella black heads I had stopped using it.
1948 2018-11-09 20:46:44 I even learned in school that the rail system in my country is all kinds of fucked up in terms of standardization because of the oil / automobile lobby, so that it's impossible to haul cargo by train across the country without unloading and reloading every few states.
1949 2018-11-09 20:46:44 We recognise that the destruction of the world's rainforests from expanding and unsustainable palm oil production is a concern. Sustainable palm oil cultivation practices must be promoted to preserve ecosystems and bring sustainable benefits to local communities.2/3

1952 2018-11-09 20:46:30 Narcissist are shady salespeople. They sold us trash as a “soul mate.” They sold us a life that never came to fruition as promised. They’re simple snake oil peddlers. You don’t need that snake oil.
1953 2018-11-09 20:46:26 @IcelandFoods I will be praying for no palm oil vegan mince pies next year <3 You've already done so much for our planet and the animals by making the changes you have. Thank you so much.
1954 2018-11-09 20:46:25 Good Evening. We are a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and already source 100% of palm oil from suppliers who are RSPO members. The RSPO aims to develop and implement global environmental and social standards for sustainable palm oil production.1/3
1955 2018-11-09 20:46:23 Huh, I was thinking Gulf Oil. But yours is better. Although I think of 76 as more Hannover 96.
1956 2018-11-09 20:46:17 Would love @tesco @asda @sainsburys etc to do the same thing and remove palm oil from their own brand products! Well done Iceland foods,  hopefully this starts a change.
1957 2018-11-09 20:46:16 The S&P 500 fell on Friday and deepened its losses as shares of large technology, industrial and material companies taking a hit after weak Chinese data and a slide in oil prices raised concerns about global growth.
1958 2018-11-09 20:46:12 Oil pens are everything so handy
1959 2018-11-09 20:46:06 Interesting divergence:

$XOP +0.6%
$XLE +0.4%

Time to buy?.......
1960 2018-11-09 20:46:02 tfw you quit using the dropper for CBD oil and just drink it out of the bottle like a 5 hour energy
1961 2018-11-09 20:45:59 So I was thinking of #euz scoping due in....23 percent down. 
that is a hold surely even when I was down more.
1962 2018-11-09 20:45:56 yooooo i know palm oil is horrific but am i wrong in thinking it’s the highest yielding oil? like if all the other oils were to replace palm oil they’d have an even worse effect on the environment ??  does that make sense
1963 2018-11-09 20:45:41 Why is so much oil in foods people cook!?? I feel kinda disgusted and weak.. I'll cook for myself from now on..
1964 2018-11-09 20:45:38 I love palm oil and hate orangutans...... 

No idea how it’s a Xmas advert but it is decent
1965 2018-11-09 20:45:37 By the way, France imports over a million barrels of oil PER DAY - because they don't have their own - if they did, what they're doing would likely be different.  They'd be using THEIR OIL just like Canada does.
1966 2018-11-09 20:45:34 Try bio oil  or come see for some redlight therapy sessions
1967 2018-11-09 20:45:33 Just to add, Allan, horizontal/directional drilling plus fracking allowed the industry to tap oil from low-permeable reservoirs (the oil does not naturally flow).
1968 2018-11-09 20:45:27 Olive Oil could have whipped it all, making out in the white house.
1969 2018-11-09 20:45:25 The only people global warming is fake to is Big Oil, car industry and rich people who benefit from unregulated factories.
1970 2018-11-09 20:45:14 Bio oil
1971 2018-11-09 20:45:08 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1972 2018-11-09 20:45:01 I loved the ad. Codwallop to too political. So we can't decided for ourselves. I have a reaction to Palm oil and so do my family I won't go into detail but the most important fact is the 25 Orangutans that are killed everyday. #SaveTheOrangutans #BestAdOnTwitter
1973 2018-11-09 20:45:00 This beard oil got my beard right
1974 2018-11-09 20:44:57 Oil change
1975 2018-11-09 20:44:47 You guys are missing the bigger idea - need to open a combination auto body shop + medical clinic. Get your oil changed while you have your physical. Can print money.
1976 2018-11-09 20:44:39 @toryboypierce @LBC  But is it a Christmas Ad? Are Christmas ads now an opportunity for activism. I agree with the palm oil campaign, HOWEVER this could be a slippery slope for more activist ads parading as Xmas ads.
1977 2018-11-09 20:44:26 It is very telling when a political leader stoops rudely interrupting so no conversation nor explanations, or information can be given.  Blatantly slimey tactics & pretty well much the same oil as we were seeing for the last 16 Liberal prior the NDP/Green coalition government.
1978 2018-11-09 20:44:24 Big oil should pay the majority, if not all, to fix climate damage! It's their fault we are in this mess!
1979 2018-11-09 20:44:18 Oil, milk, corn syrup...
@SanMarcoTrain will say “anything that will slow you down and make you sit longer” - no doubt contemplating said futility.

1980 2018-11-09 20:44:17 Olive oil and dash of lemon? 
1981 2018-11-09 20:44:15 Add another 1.5 lakh crores of oil bonds
1982 2018-11-09 20:44:08 Ridiculous decision! This is an incredible advert and I praise @IcelandFoods for not only making the step to remove palm oil from its products but also for wanting to use their prime Xmas advertising slots to raise awareness of an important issue rather than just their products!
1983 2018-11-09 20:44:05 Oil ya scalp
1984 2018-11-09 20:43:56 Pretty high and mighty,aren’t we? Wait till you peddle your bike to the grocery store, and the shelves are bare, cause you wanted no oil, and the trucks won’t run on fairy farts.
1985 2018-11-09 20:43:40 U.S. market lower with shares of large technology, industrial & material companies taking a hit after weak Chinese data & a slide in oil prices raising concerns about global growth.
1986 2018-11-09 20:43:31 Oil will not, and should not, be considered the economic future of anywhere. Fossil fuels are environmentally disastrous; no brainer they’re also, therefore, economically unsustainable and unviable. Oil is lazy and short-term. Scotland can do better.
1987 2018-11-09 20:43:27 Oil is down to $69 too. But they'll still have the September/October $80 income to spend. Check again in January after IJGB inflows have ended.
1988 2018-11-09 20:42:58 What’s embarrassing is your unnatural orange hue and your reverse raccoon eyes. You look like you should live in the Borneo jungles, of which there are fewer and fewer thanks to palm oil.
1989 2018-11-09 20:42:54 I don't doubt they are getting rid of the palm oil, and they bought the rights to the film, and it's not been allowed because it's by a campaigning third party - so technically, everything they say is true. Very clever. That's capitalism.
1990 2018-11-09 20:42:52 Well done @Clearcast - your unimaginative interpretation of the rules has ensured that @IcelandFoods’ advert has gone viral. Opposing palm oil deforestation is not political, it’s life-saving. Merry Christmas. #Humbug
1991 2018-11-09 20:42:48 Hardest working people be your local oil man
1992 2018-11-09 20:42:43 Do you do hot oil treatments on wet or dry hair?
1993 2018-11-09 20:42:38 Unfortunately banning it won't help,it needs to be sustainable and closely monitored,otherwise palm oil will get replaced with growing  other oils that will do even more damage to the environment due to the amount needed.
These situations are never black and white
1994 2018-11-09 20:42:35 I'm no comms expert but from a lay persons pov I think it's very informative. I learnt more about Palm oil production in that advert than I knew before and I'm sure my children would completely understand it & want me to buy Palm oil free products too. This is an ad to remember
1995 2018-11-09 20:42:28 The media won’t admit they have a problem. That’s the first step..
1996 2018-11-09 20:42:18 I don’t know the exact time frame when they will he palm oil free but they are the only major food retailer to make this commitment
1997 2018-11-09 20:42:12 Koch Bros father Fred built Stalin & Hitler oil refiners. Corp greed & racism/genocide. EU & US wealthy placed Trump as Hitler: Deutsche, Rockefeller Standard Oil, Koch, Thyssen,Harrimans,Bush, Morgan Chase, DuPont, Ford..Dulles/CIA..Corp wars cont’d 21st..Tech $B..Prison time
1998 2018-11-09 20:42:01 iT literally is- I kind of understand with younger kids seeing it but I don’t think that should restrict it anyways, everyone needs to educated on the matter and stop using palm oil
1999 2018-11-09 20:41:42 1) then every zone of the parliament is solely responsible for it's own growth. Which takes the "oil boom" out of the way and focused more on the local resources. 

2) Every parliament can have regional laws that suit it's people, and in turn the people 1/2
2000 2018-11-09 20:41:42 No. I’m saying never be scared to exit at a loss if the only possible options is the share price going lower or cash.
2001 2018-11-09 20:41:42 Door handles, oil consumption, sellers hiding airbag deployment (out of 7 z I looked at 5 were hiding airbag deployment), wheel bearings, torn axle boots (if you do see it, listen for clicking axles turning), oil pressure above 20psi at all times.
2002 2018-11-09 20:41:42 I like lavender oil
2003 2018-11-09 20:41:41 the reason outside of grilled cheese mayo works so well is becuase your basically making french toast of it (egg/oil) and that causes the beautiful color and crisp. with out eggs you dont get that. I <3 vegan mayo, but its not good for toasting
2004 2018-11-09 20:41:38 Oil price will go even lower in Mid-2019 when Texas Shale Oil pipelines are finished and 3500+ wells already drilled are hydro-fractured

2008 2018-11-09 20:41:27 We need Ecosocialism yesterday. California is going to burn down, our farms will turn to dust, the Amazon is about to get paved over, and Canada is excited to pipe tar sand oil into the ground to sell what doesn't leak out on the world market... F this S
2009 2018-11-09 20:41:20 When are we going to rise up and take a stand as a province? I guess it’s going to take a lot of people to lose everything to finally voice their opinion. EI is almost over for a lot of people, so it’s only going to get worse! I’m an oil sands worker and I freaken had it!!!

2011 2018-11-09 20:40:59 I know man, the palm oil thing is so bad, was tweeting about this earlier too
2012 2018-11-09 20:40:50 I wish @asda would not stock products that contain palm oil. Almost everything in the vegetarian section contains it as a substitute. Oh and @aptaclubuk really need to stop using it in their baby formula.
2013 2018-11-09 20:40:45 I work on an oil rig and not one person is black  and there are only 2 women  what should we do about that ????
2014 2018-11-09 20:40:42 I’m getting Vietnam flashbacks of my mission with Hosea. I’ll use snake oil then dead eye tf out of it. Steve Irwin took his chance and look what happened to him
2015 2018-11-09 20:40:39 PSA: buy your oil changes on groupon cause who wants to pay full price?
2016 2018-11-09 20:40:31 oil + $$ = greedy corruption at the highest levels
2017 2018-11-09 20:40:27 Yes it helps. The face wash is oil free & sulfate free. It doesnt over dry your skin. It leaves your skin feeling light and clean. Vitamin e oil doesnt clog pores & is good for blemishes/ marks on your skin. I don’t take any pills just drink lots of water & watch the things i eat
2018 2018-11-09 20:40:22 Ugh at least it’s not the oil change. Lol

2022 2018-11-09 20:40:05 It's quite a mediocre advert mainly because it's meant to be a Christmas advertisement, but it's a water down version of a WWF advert that speaks a political message but doesn't show how you can help (besides saying stop buying palm oil as it does in every zoo exhibit ever.
2023 2018-11-09 20:39:50 U.S. oil prices down near 1% breaking below $60 a barrel Friday,tumbling deeper into a bear market-closed lower for 10th day in a row-the longest losing streak since July 1984.

2026 2018-11-09 20:39:28 5/6. Crisis for Cdn oil & gas is economic crisis for all of Canada! #cdnpoli
2027 2018-11-09 20:39:25 It's not about the politics it's about the financial. According to Greenpeace palm oil is in 50% of supermarket products. That's a lot of political persuasion.
2028 2018-11-09 20:39:08 So, resisting the ravages of palm oil extraction is deemed “too political” eh? Need to remember that next time there are tv adverts for petrol, oil, gas, etc.
2029 2018-11-09 20:39:04 Some of these corrupt people are gauging responses from public before making a commercial jump against soft targets like Middle class suburban people, Indians, rich Asians, oil executives etc...

# Urgent - very dangerous news ..

Spokesman of US/UK/FR/Saudi coalition is paving the way to target #Yemen Hodeidah port,Oil Safar ship and all food wherehouses in Hodeidah on the pretext of used to hide arms
which will lead to a definite starving of 22 millions yemeni
2031 2018-11-09 20:38:47 They definetly do,that's by the way, I sell original undiluted designer oil perfumes
2032 2018-11-09 20:38:47 If only white women cared as much about voting as they do essential oil and pyramid schemes.
2033 2018-11-09 20:38:46 Lay that pipe. Cheaper to flow oil in pipeline than trains and risk derailment.
2034 2018-11-09 20:38:41 Yup, I like the market summary, but unsure about unconventional oil exposure.
2035 2018-11-09 20:38:28 I’m so sore from the gym I feel like the Tin Man without oil
2036 2018-11-09 20:38:25 Tim, it was always about the oil and still is. I’m sure you agree.
2037 2018-11-09 20:38:23 Listening to ER docs on guns is like listening to your auto mechanic on putting sand in your oil.
2038 2018-11-09 20:38:17 I think this oil change is going to cost me $50 and I don’t like being an adult
2039 2018-11-09 20:38:12 May suggest coving the kids in oil
2040 2018-11-09 20:38:10 “Continue selling body oil in the library” lmfaoooooo
2041 2018-11-09 20:38:00 France hit by 69% rise in anti-Semitic acts @CNNI. That's exactly why France is suffering. God has simply NOT given the mental capacity He gave to Jews to others. No matter their oil, wealth, numbers. What if France had a 69% of anti-Islamic acts. Would France then act ?
2042 2018-11-09 20:37:50 There’s a girl changing my oil because I don’t know how. 
#secretfact
2043 2018-11-09 20:37:49 exactly !!! i jus use coconut oil and cotton swabs (idk if thats the best thing to do for my skin but it works)
2044 2018-11-09 20:37:45 Хотела написать какой-то умный твит, но забыла какой(((
2045 2018-11-09 20:37:37 Are you replacing palm oil with other vegetable oils (and are these grown in a responsible way?), or are you reducing the number of processed food sold/produced (which is the long-term solution)?
2046 2018-11-09 20:37:27 me: i'm veggie bc i care abt the environment nd the increasing destruction of the earth's natural resources 

also me: plantain nd pepe sauce w out palm oil??? nkita rasia anya gi 
2047 2018-11-09 20:37:15 Спасибо!
2048 2018-11-09 20:37:02 Come and buy perfume oil 
Then I will tell you how 
2049 2018-11-09 20:36:47 But everytime I go it’s not close to time to change the oil. I think my taste buds finally are over chick fila fries 
2050 2018-11-09 20:36:42 Тогда приятного аппетита!пусть этот момент длиться вечность пхпх:3
2051 2018-11-09 20:36:41 What medium did you use? It almost looks real  that’s gotta be oil paint right?
2052 2018-11-09 20:36:37 And then they brought an oil diffuser thing into the office and put it on MAX

I'm dealing with some sensory overload right now, but it is friday, so I will live.
2053 2018-11-09 20:36:34 I think he is saying it metaphorically.

Food wise, Iranian are massive wasters of food. Plus they have an oversupply of food. 

Iranians are the laziest people on the planet, most of their problems stem from laziness.

Trade problems involve oil and aircraft parts etc.
2054 2018-11-09 20:36:31 I order to win a  big war like ww3 we need oil and gold but drugs we dont need
2055 2018-11-09 20:36:23 Man i really didnt think id need an oil change this soon 
2056 2018-11-09 20:36:15 Fundamentally, I agree with the guidelines on political advertising that they were testing this against - but in this case I think they made the wrong call. This was a company explaining why they have dropped palm oil. But the problem will be the use of Greenpeace material.
2057 2018-11-09 20:36:10 Ok folks, get your oil boiler serviced by EWING ENERGY to check its efficiency. We use the latest efficiency testers to check an make adjustments to save you ££££ and help the environment!
2058 2018-11-09 20:36:00 Chick fila keeps playing so I had to call and my kids think it’s funny. I’m serious about my fries! 
Me: did y’all change the oil? No more peanut oil? The fries taste different now or like the oil is old.
Employee:we’ve heard that before it may be the oil was close to change time
2059 2018-11-09 20:35:59 What a load of rubbish since when did standing up for animals Being wiped out due to palm oil become political? You should allow it & let us the public decide if it’s right or wrong & going By the responses it should be aired
2060 2018-11-09 20:35:50 Quiz me this. How can humans farm and regulate majority of plants for food and other things, yet they can’t make Palm Oil farms? Like it can’t be a climate thing because cocoa needs very tropical climates and we’ve been able to make farms for it.
2061 2018-11-09 20:35:48 I'm so proud of Iceland for cutting out palm oil in their own brand products and bringing out a bomb vegan range. @IcelandFoods hmu i'll suck ya dick
2062 2018-11-09 20:35:44 Coconut Oil : The lube of KINGS
2063 2018-11-09 20:35:37 Divestment best understood as a project to build social capital in community campaigns and erode cultural capital of oil industry
2064 2018-11-09 20:35:30 And us normal tax paying citizens would not benefit one iota from all that oil
2065 2018-11-09 20:35:30 Try adding olive oil, moisturiser and sheer butter to your spritz. Sleep with a satin scarf to lock in moisture and try basing your hair with a mixture of all your moisturising hair products once a week and sleep with a shower cap underneath your satin scarf. I hope this helps
2066 2018-11-09 20:35:29 but all the plastic??with global warming nearing its peak?? sis get a jar of coconut oil it’ll last longer than how many wipes this bag has
2067 2018-11-09 20:35:25 @Channel4 @Channel4News @channel5 @ITV @itvnews why ban this ad when it shows the truth about deforestation and it shows what palm oil really does! It's not too political
2068 2018-11-09 20:35:24 Lakeridge Health is such a poo hospital. Entire triage area is falling apart but yeah add five flat screens to the waiting room. That’s what these people need, 24 hour news coverage and ads for the new essential oil store in Whitby. 
2069 2018-11-09 20:35:23 I can’t believe this has been banned! I read that Iceland were banning palm oil from their products and shared the story with my year 4 class - they gave you a round of applause. We campaign every year for saving the rainforest as part of our topic and watch videos just like this
2070 2018-11-09 20:35:19 so are you saying you get out with anything with a twenty percent loss or more ?
2071 2018-11-09 20:35:17 Beard oil is the best thing invented since sliced bread! And I am glad men are using it again! 
2072 2018-11-09 20:35:09 Go on to the @lbc website to see banned ad by @IcelandFoods its a powerful, emotional  & important message about destruction of rain forests For palm oil for our food. It should  be shown on prime time TV
2073 2018-11-09 20:35:02 Not to mention that a few years back, Obama gave around 500+ million to a Brazilian oil company ‘Petrobras’PBR NYSE
And who owned a Big Stake in PBR? You Guessed it, George Soros.
2074 2018-11-09 20:34:55 I think it should be shown on TV to raise awareness of the palm oil devastation.
2075 2018-11-09 20:34:51 "Germany's oil industry association also rejected such a change to CO2 pricing, saying it would merely be a tax increase in disguise." - That would make up for the Billions of Euros in subsidies and tax breaks the oil & gas industry has had every year for the last hundred years.
2076 2018-11-09 20:34:48 Managing stress can be different for everyone. Here are a few ideas:

1. Watching funny movies 
2. Soaking in a hot bath with lavender oil 
3. Walking the dog 
4. Reading a book 
5. Do something for someone else 
6. Painting or drawing 
7. Get a massage

#stressmanagement
2077 2018-11-09 20:34:45 That's the whole point of advertising but as someone that spends far too long checking packaging for palm oil it would make my life much easier
2078 2018-11-09 20:34:42 Imagine our leaders hyped our oil like the Olympics. 
3 reasons why I will vote No
-Calgary unemployment rate 8.0%
-Alberta recently suffered Canada's 2 largest natural disasters
- Do nothing committee's being paid to do nothing
2079 2018-11-09 20:34:41 Got my oil change 
2080 2018-11-09 20:34:39 All the corporate welfare that's doled out is socialism also, subsidies from the collective tax payers handed back to a smaller groups. Oil company subsidies,paying farmers b/c of the tariffs and any number of other tax dollar giveaways
2081 2018-11-09 20:34:39 I see this and cheer, then realise all that oil and gas is going right in the water and that just really hurts.
2082 2018-11-09 20:34:39 The power of social media!! Thank you for this ad and for your pledge to remove palm oil from all your own-brand foods
2083 2018-11-09 20:34:35 Alongside raising awareness of deforestation you could also highlight substainable palm oil companies aswell. To have small farmers pay the price with their livelihood on lands they haven’t destructed isn’t fair on them, us developed countries should have better judgement.
2084 2018-11-09 20:34:31 I'm seriously going into @IcelandFoods now. I never shop there, but I so love the #IcelandChristmasAdvert and their pledge to have no palm oil in their branded goods - that I'm now going to do all I can to buy their goods. Will save me time reading labels.
2085 2018-11-09 20:34:25 It makes a great present for the man in your life because it comes with beard wash, beard conditioner, beard oil, and beard balm. #1111TreatYourself #contest
2086 2018-11-09 20:34:24 Doesn't Canada have enough oil sands to supply it's own needs for a very long time? I thought I read it does.
2087 2018-11-09 20:34:21 Это будет мой первый съеденный Доширак. Хочу уже долго его попробовать)
2088 2018-11-09 20:34:20 Think your palm oil message could have been delivered any time of year! Still, you got the desired publicity I guess. Xmas adverts are supposed to be non political!!
2089 2018-11-09 20:34:20 Baba mi na small oil dey o 
2090 2018-11-09 20:34:15 Ooh but it is true. 

*rolls in baby oil*
2091 2018-11-09 20:34:13 No sesame or sesame oil please 
2092 2018-11-09 20:33:58 His brother used Brexit, even though he didn't believe in it, to heighten his profile. Now Jo is doing exactly the same hoping anti-brexit will do it for him. They're both snake oil salesmen.
2093 2018-11-09 20:33:58 It’s just a case of some decision maker has had a big wad of cash from some palm oil lobby group or something. The funny thing is, is that the advert will garner more deliberate views online now than it ever would have on tv. Maybe Iceland wanted it banned?
2094 2018-11-09 20:33:42 Yeah. Soozan has her moments of dreadful snobbery & righteousness, but...... she can be thoughtful & kind. But.... Nee’oil is still a saint. #thearchers
2095 2018-11-09 20:33:36 It is why condensate and oil exports should be classed all as one. The waivers this time mean that someone like China could chose between condensate or oil depending on their need.
2096 2018-11-09 20:33:27 Всё, блин. Аж перечитать захотелось. Особенно часть про лабиринт Минотавра...
2097 2018-11-09 20:33:27 When you're trolley is overflowing with shopping and you're WELL over your £65 budget but it comes to £44 at @LidlUK plus got a free olive oil at your new Baguley store? #HappyDays #FridayFeeling #budgetsavvymums
2098 2018-11-09 20:33:20 Good point! I think it's a superb advert, one of the best I've seen in a long time. Vested interests taking control again...must have loads invested in palm oil!
2099 2018-11-09 20:33:16 "Beds Are Burning" by Midnight Oil or "Don't Dream It's Over" by Crowded House, please and thank you @danhardee
2100 2018-11-09 20:33:11 Are you insane??? @Acosta and "great reporter" go together like oil and water. #cnnisIsis

2102 2018-11-09 20:33:00 I'd say 13 but just this week i just spot treated oil spots out of daughters yoga pants.
2103 2018-11-09 20:32:46 Iceland are committed to moving away from the use of palm oil in their products and are using this ad to explain why. This seems a reasonable thing to do to me, are we not looking for companies to be more responsible and environmentally aware?
2104 2018-11-09 20:32:46 Las las we go dey alright
2105 2018-11-09 20:32:43 Vitamin C toner and coconut oil for moisturizer!!
2106 2018-11-09 20:32:37 Да, чёрт возьми. Ему никогда и ничего просто так не давалось. Он живой, мыслящий человек, с характером и мотивацией, а не идеальностью вместо личности....
2107 2018-11-09 20:32:28 Thank you. @IcelandFoods are saying... 'Yes, we are going to make it absolutely clear by using a ‘no palm oil’ sticker on our packaging. By buying our branded foods, our customers are helping to solve issues around the production of palm oil.'
2108 2018-11-09 20:32:28 Oil dey your head 
2109 2018-11-09 20:32:19 My guess: $GE or Oil
2110 2018-11-09 20:32:13 Historical data found an 82 per cent correlation between oil prices and the
Canada–U.S. exchange rate.

2112 2018-11-09 20:32:07 @toryboypierce Andrew Hemp Oil could easily replace Palm Oil. But of course any thing that competes with corporate monopolies gets a ban. Hemp can grow quickly in most environments ,used for bio plastics, paper, the list goes on.
2113 2018-11-09 20:32:04 He needs to deserve the respect before he gets it. He's like that rainbow colored slick of oil on top of the water. If you're dumb you might think it's pretty, but people who actually know a little something know that it's a pollution that's destroying everything it touches.
2114 2018-11-09 20:32:03 I got up to go to the bathroom last night and dropped something but I was half sleep so I was like whatever I’ll get it in the morning. Why I just went in there and almost died. I spilled a bottle of oil on the whole fucking floor 
2115 2018-11-09 20:31:55 The number one reason I wish my dad was around when I was growing up is so I wouldn’t have to pay these goons to change my oil
2116 2018-11-09 20:31:55 Get some snake oil from your grandma Andrew!  We aren’t buying yours!
2117 2018-11-09 20:31:51 2/ The oil industry, not government, caused the US shale revolution, thus reducing interest in Canadian oil. Quite suddenly we need a new strategy: diversifying our oil markets. Unfortunately, this is not done overnight, nor are pipelines built overnight, not even in the US. /3

2119 2018-11-09 20:31:33 alsoo the price of gas in California is very much unrelated to the minimum wage in cali, gas price for the most part is set on a national scale and determined mostly by factors in the global economy such as war, tariffs, and simply the supply of oil.

2123 2018-11-09 20:31:07 I don't suggest anyone buy it. But great if the company wants to cut palm oil.
2124 2018-11-09 20:31:01 Dude my dissertation is literally on the detrimental effects of palm oil on the rainforest that advert controversy has just give me a whole new section to write about omg
2125 2018-11-09 20:31:00 The government of Panama has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of David Spade in a twill wig.
2126 2018-11-09 20:30:57 Hackstring snake oil pulpit talk
2127 2018-11-09 20:30:42 @IcelandFoods,how about using the publicity to direct people to the @Greenpeace Rang-Tan campaign rather than benefitting yourselves from media coverage? After all it is about the palm oil, isn't it? Glad it's getting media attention but perhaps you shouldn't get all the credit.
2128 2018-11-09 20:30:40 It probably would have passed if you had already completed your goal of removing all Palm oil products. The fact is that you are currently the same as other supermarkets, whilst trying to imply something else.
2129 2018-11-09 20:30:36 Mr. Scheer, unfortunately you have mischaracterized events. In fact, Canada was thrilled to be dependent on the US demand for our oil. That is why Mr. Harper spent a lot of our money pushing Keystone XL. The oil industry is reeling from a self-inflicted wound. /2
2130 2018-11-09 20:30:36 Thanks for taking this stance with @Greenpeace - shameful behaviour by @Clearcast and U.K. advertising legislation for not permitting this important ad. The companies using damaging palm oil get the air time whilst orangutans continue to be killed. #orangutan #RangTan #PalmOil
2131 2018-11-09 20:30:34 Because the MEGA RICH companies destroying the forests for palm oil didn't want you to know. So they have a word with their mates in power and bingo. It goes away
BRILLIANT FROM ICELAND THAT!
2132 2018-11-09 20:30:18 Changed my bedding today please tell my WHY THE TISSUE OIL SPILLED ON IT

Now I have to whoop my own ass
2133 2018-11-09 20:30:16 A rational one
2134 2018-11-09 20:30:15 1)Don't sleep with makeup on!This may seem silly but all the foundation and powder clogs your pores and causes spotsTry starting a skin routine to make a bigger difference x
2)Put Vaseline/Castor Oil on your eyelashes and eyebrows to enhance the growth and be on fleek always
2135 2018-11-09 20:30:15 ‘Oil Slick’ on account of the natural disaster that is pretending to be his hair.
2136 2018-11-09 20:30:04 she’s just making shit up as she goes lmao “no palm oil” and “no cane sugar” doesn’t mean the rest of the ingredients are quality
2137 2018-11-09 20:30:01 dafaq do they do with truffle oil?
2138 2018-11-09 20:30:01 1) African black soap 
2) Witch Hazel
3) moisturizer (lotion or oil)
2139 2018-11-09 20:29:59 A new record! Crude oil drops 10 days in a row.  Markets are well supplied - with record production from Saudi Arabia, Russia, and US and expanding production from Iraq and Libya. Fundamentals are pointing to more downside pricing risk as global demand looks to be softening.
2140 2018-11-09 20:29:50 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
2141 2018-11-09 20:29:41 But with something like palm oil there're much stronger economic incentives to grow palm at the expense of native habitats. It's much harder to sell the merits of less lucrative options.
But ultimately our daily decisions on this side of the planet have a real impact on the other
2142 2018-11-09 20:29:26 Trying to find a high quality organic essential oil sampler kit, that doesn't cost an arm and a leg....is like trying to sell both feet to buy a pair of shoes.

2150 2018-11-09 20:28:51 Ready for a oil change/ movie date
2151 2018-11-09 20:28:49 eliminate single use plastics and the need for oil. Most everything consumers purchase, should be in its rawest form of packaging. Consumers should bring all containers needed for whatever it is they will buy. Refills, instead of garbage.
2152 2018-11-09 20:28:40 If palm oil is banned completely other crops to replace it will take up more land, which also doesn’t do the environment any favours. And what are you going to do for the small farmers who haven’t contributed to deforestation who live side by side with wildlife?
2153 2018-11-09 20:28:38 Is there a difference between how we traditionally harvest palm fruits and make palm oil in Nigeria and how big corporations do it around the world? 

Because I don’t remember Nigerians having to take down forests
2154 2018-11-09 20:28:33 Aidan’s photographs of the ocean resemble textural oil paintings blending in and out of turquoise and indigo hues juxtaposed against sandy brushstrokes. I have one of his artworks and love it’s breathtaking beauty.

2157 2018-11-09 20:28:26 mmmm....I think I know which oil n gas company you was getting at.
Still holding.
2158 2018-11-09 20:28:15 Just rub this crystal on it and it will be ok, its even essential oil lubed.
2159 2018-11-09 20:28:14 Ooga change him own oil like dirty caveman. There be myth once u switch to synthetic, it bad to go back. But that myth. Mixing synthetic and mineral also fine because that's exactly what "synthetic blend" be.
2160 2018-11-09 20:28:12 Hey Jim. All Palm Oil in Ocado Own Brand products is from RSPO (Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil) approved sources. As for reducing plastic, we're constantly taking steps to monitor and minimise this, we're all signed to the UK plastic pact :) - Meg
2161 2018-11-09 20:28:09 We recognise that the destruction of the world's rainforests from expanding and unsustainable palm oil production is a concern. Sustainable palm oil cultivation practices must be promoted to preserve ecosystems and bring sustainable benefits to local communities.

2163 2018-11-09 20:27:53 Maybe for civil servants. People believe this because thousands of Albertan's in the oil patch are getting hammerred. But the NDP believes everything is rosy because they keep adding public sector employees.
2164 2018-11-09 20:27:53 @toryboypierce @lbc Palm oil in my cupboards, Alpen Cereal Bars, Angel Delight Strawberry, Batchelors Cup a soup Minestrone, Oreo Original biscuits, Bisto Best Gravy granules, Mars, Twix & Snickers all have palm fat too. Shocking!
2165 2018-11-09 20:27:44 What is palm oil used for? Sorry but I just don't know,thanks
2166 2018-11-09 20:27:37 Shey girlfriend no be wife ni
2167 2018-11-09 20:27:36 Omg they're playing lady gaga now in the Walmart while I'm waiting for my oil change. It's like @VenusEnvyDrag is really here with me jdhshdjdoowgs
2168 2018-11-09 20:27:34 Below $56/barrel US oil will be bear mkt.
2169 2018-11-09 20:27:30 Good evening Peekaboo. We are a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and already source 100% of palm oil from suppliers who are RSPO members. The RSPO aims to develop and implement global environmental and social standards for sustainable palm oil production.
2170 2018-11-09 20:27:26 It was a lot more than marketing. In SoCal they bought up the electric rail and ripped up the tracks to sell oil, cars, tires.
2171 2018-11-09 20:27:12 Advertising IS propaganda. Do you think palm oil or soda drink are less lethal than China? Think again.
2172 2018-11-09 20:27:08 Money managers have cut their bullish Nymex WTI crude oil bets by 35,905 net-long positions to 160,291, weekly CFTC data on futures and options show.
The net-long position was the least bullish in about 14 months

2173 2018-11-09 20:27:08 Well I am sorry to disappoint you, but Scotland has and still does produce more oil than Norway. I am on the oldest rig in the North Sea and we are producing over 10 million barrels per month.
2174 2018-11-09 20:26:54 Also, you say #NoPalmOilChristmas ... yet your ad says you “are removing” palm oil in your products. Can we have a timeframe for that? It’s not much of a claim otherwise...
2175 2018-11-09 20:26:54 Brah... 100 for an oil change is outrageous. But... My shit foreign so 
2176 2018-11-09 20:26:52 I don’t believe in God because God doesn’t believe in me! Public school is a brainwashing tool for the terminally uncool! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
2177 2018-11-09 20:26:49 Where there is gas or oil on the continent,  big thieves thrive! This stuff is a curse
2178 2018-11-09 20:26:46 It should be shown the Christmas advert to show people about palm oil
2179 2018-11-09 20:26:37 Oh my petition was the greenpeace one about ending palm oil use, not the one about unbanning the ad. Not sure which you signed but please consider the greenpeace one if you haven’t x
2180 2018-11-09 20:26:25 Is this the oil that was running out during Indy Ref 1 ? .,,  more lies?
2181 2018-11-09 20:26:20 One critical question not asked or I missed it.
Per day production at a given relative humidity or within a humidity range
2182 2018-11-09 20:26:16 You're always a pompous bag of dicks.
2183 2018-11-09 20:26:14 Never. Ok much lower. But they were making money with oil lower after cutting out a lot of costs.
2184 2018-11-09 20:26:05 I'd gives us total say in who fishes, drills for oil and any other activity other than rights of passage.
2185 2018-11-09 20:26:00 Happy Friday!

2186 2018-11-09 20:25:55 Hi, instead of banning palm oil outright how about sourcing small organic palm oil farmers who don’t contribute to deforestation? A large portion of it is due to urbanisation.
2187 2018-11-09 20:25:52 The fall and stand song oh..I don't know the artist name.
2188 2018-11-09 20:25:46 Got my led lights, scented candles, diffuser, tea lights, scented oil, weekend is gonna be so damn cosy!
2189 2018-11-09 20:25:44 Do they contain palm oil?   
2190 2018-11-09 20:25:41 The ridiculous thing there is WWF would be allowed to use that footage. I agree it's very clever of Iceland but they are simply using it to explain their intention to cut palm oil from products. Surely the purpose of a video being used should be taken into consideration.
2191 2018-11-09 20:25:35 Palm oil is a high fat oil found in a lot of everyday products, taken from the fruit of certain palms. The rising demand for palm oil has caused an increase in demand for plantations for the trees to grow, and the quickest way to do this is by burning land.
2192 2018-11-09 20:25:35 Lobster yes, and roll yes....a little olive oil in place of mayo, fresh pepper....mmmmmm
2193 2018-11-09 20:25:33 With out an oil drum of viagra I doubt it.
2194 2018-11-09 20:25:24 Sterling is going to rip League 2 up when we get penalised for being oil cunts
2195 2018-11-09 20:25:18 Why are we complaining & getting upset about how palm oil destroys the planet and other animals habitats but then are perfectly happy to go home and eat dead animals which ALSO destroys the planet and other animals habitats?

Disconnection at its finest.

2196 2018-11-09 20:25:07 It's four glass panes, two iron ingots, one hook, two strings and one oil.
2197 2018-11-09 20:25:02 Oil down 10 consecutive days and XLE saves the market.
2198 2018-11-09 20:25:01 @IcelandFoods About 90% of soup that are prepared in Africa are prepared with palm oil, so iceland what do you want them to now eat?
2199 2018-11-09 20:24:59 @toryboypierce You sound like someone who's swallowed green wash whole. Clearcast is spot on. It's Emma Thompson + Greenpeace who have a track record of reckless extremist nonsense. Where's the comment from the palm oil lobby? Appalling 'journalism', Andrew.
2200 2018-11-09 20:24:50 i will be in walmart for the next few hours while my oil is being changed so if anyone wants to pick me up so i don’t have to hang out here that’d be cool but if not that’s fine too
2201 2018-11-09 20:24:49 You also mentioned rosehip oil,good stuff bro.
2202 2018-11-09 20:24:47 Pure emu oil. A couple of drops twice a day where it hurts. Won't work quickly and may take months but when it does the pain stays away and you can stop using it. Saved me many surgeries for knees and rotator cuff both shoulders.
2203 2018-11-09 20:24:46 Gas and oil tend to be  curse in Africa!
2204 2018-11-09 20:24:35 Because when a population nears its carrying capacity, its growth had better decrease substantially, or it will run out of resources and space. The global population is still increasing. It's hard to fathom you seeing this as an extinction crisis, when we're running out of oil.
2205 2018-11-09 20:24:35 I never once commented on or criticised their policy on palm oil.
2206 2018-11-09 20:24:29 I got one of those hey the car needs new tires and the other car needs oil and the house needs carpet before Christmas also Christmas with a 5 year old. *explodes* lol

2208 2018-11-09 20:24:13 No reputable manager would ask for a “fee” to work with a writer. And agents cannot by law. It’s generally 10% for agent and up to 15% for manager. Period. Stay away from these snake oil types.
2209 2018-11-09 20:24:09 Roast them with salt salt and pep and a bit of oil!
2210 2018-11-09 20:24:08 Assuming you burn it. You still need oil in a low carbon economy.
2211 2018-11-09 20:24:02 Marty P. JONES and Joe Levenson and Larry and Joe Levenson and Johnny and Tommy Levenson used Atlantic city Cooper Levenson to get  tech from Cooper Oil Fields In Alaska to hold me prisoner in my mind waves.

2214 2018-11-09 20:23:50 The term '"Deep State" I first heard used by Peter Dale Scott.  "The American Deep State: Wall Street, Big Oil, and the Attack on U.S. Democracy (War and Peace Library)"
2215 2018-11-09 20:23:31 I know, Cadbury's chocolate for example and why is it in peanut butter? peanuts have their own oil.
2216 2018-11-09 20:23:24 It’s like getting the bad oil out of the system . Economies are organic systems - who said this.. Sanyal?

2220 2018-11-09 20:23:07 That’s fine! I just have to get an oil change but I should be free around 11/12?

2222 2018-11-09 20:23:04 It's actually an acronym for Canadian Oil because it was first created in Canada

2224 2018-11-09 20:22:49 Iceland is the only supermarket committed to the removal of palm oil in its products and should be supported. It’s vital for our planet that #palmoil be eradicated from our foods & household products. Bravo @IcelandFoods
2225 2018-11-09 20:22:44 For comparison its as if there was advert for palm oil that mostly consisted of video from a named deforestation campaigning group. I think the Iceland advert would have been OK if it had not been directly linked to Greenpeace. Hope that is clear enough for you. Have a nice day
2226 2018-11-09 20:22:42 Hey Kenney, 
It’s all these special interest groups, they are being funded by foreign money to turn the tap off on Alberta Oil. Canada is under attack. Why is it that no other oil producing country in the world is being targeted? To top it off, our Fed gov is letting it happen
2227 2018-11-09 20:22:39 Lol are u subbing Whizkid now
2228 2018-11-09 20:22:23 @QuornFoods by any chance is Palm oil used in your products?
2229 2018-11-09 20:22:21 To this day, media outlets still use the oil refinery on fire as Fukushima fire...so ya, I feel your pain! I feel like learning how to actually search well needs to be a class or something. Oh wait, I guess that is journalism class?!
2230 2018-11-09 20:22:09 Those are some pretty specific needs, maybe stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia and you can achieve that goal?
2231 2018-11-09 20:21:57 You been on this since 1960 to date...tell me one benefit of ur vote and that of your fathers to date, tell me one benefit of one Nigeria of not to be called conquered slaves relegated to the background in all spheres, Your homeland ravaged by oil spillage, by herdsman...Nwanne?
2232 2018-11-09 20:21:55 Yada, yada, blah, blah, blah.. . The native Texans that you refer to are young. If you look at the link I dropped under yours it backs up what I said. Veto voters are young and naive or minority groups. Snake oil only works on vulnerable and easily influenced populations.

2236 2018-11-09 20:21:32 Every time I get my oil changed they tell me I put it off too long and I tell myself I won't do that again. Later I tell myself the milage on the sticker is just a recommendation. #WhyAmILikeThis
2237 2018-11-09 20:21:31 My mum is allergic to palm oil. Just saying.
2238 2018-11-09 20:21:31 Ok cool. Could butter work too or use oil for sure
2239 2018-11-09 20:21:28 Lmaooo I’m really a picky eater tbh. Oneittkw thingg and that meal is cancelled for me. 

Don’t like and don’t eat mackerel(ice fish)
Any thing made with fish oil is a no no
I barely tolerate seafood and fish tbh
2240 2018-11-09 20:21:23 Yeah, funny how it works, Eh? And, by funny? I mean nauseating. Do people know these palace feuds at the top hide the fact that they ALL own stock in Weapons, Oil, Pharma, etc. &, at the worst, all have big Gov't pensions waiting? They hide it all right on our windshields.

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
2243 2018-11-09 20:21:11 #NoPalmOilChristmas I cannot believe this ad had been banned! This is one of the most important issues of the day - we cannot keep destroying Orangutan forests for palm oil used in virtually everything. These creatures share 96% of their DNA with us - they’re our cousins! 
2244 2018-11-09 20:21:05 Turns out I misdiagnosed. I smelled coolant burning and saw a dash light so assumed... But it was the oil lamp full red. They replaced the oil sending unit, another $100. Now when I stop the lamp flickers. Rabbit hole.
2245 2018-11-09 20:21:05 I'm not a professional, but what I've heard is that if the grade (eg 10w30 or whatever is recommended) is even approximately right, you're fine. Dirty old oil is bad; not enough/too much is very bad. Slightly wrong grade or type, no big deal
2246 2018-11-09 20:20:57 beautifull. but... if Iceland were being selfless, they'd have made it less about them; if moral brands give up palm oil, responsible palm will go bust. mafia palm will still be used by less moral brands for increasing amount of poorer people, and will have less competition.
2247 2018-11-09 20:20:48 What bugs me about the whole global warming hoax (it still gets cold where I live) is that the scientist never asked for the opinion of the coal or oil Industries.
2248 2018-11-09 20:20:44 That discord room isn’t even public, I don’t know how he got in, and now it just smells like robot oil, and sadness in there. He won’t leave no matter what we ask and he’s just sitting in the corner. Watching and listening.
2249 2018-11-09 20:20:39 I mean what are they replacing the palm oil in their products with?
2250 2018-11-09 20:20:31 I get the general sentiment but her specific point is rooted in absolutely nothing, the price of crude oil barrels sold in gulf states has nothing to do with the wages of people in America lol
2251 2018-11-09 20:20:20 Infinitely better than Watching Jason Donovan or Kerry Katona handing out Hors d'oeuvres with cheesy music and fake smiling kiddies all around.

"We take palm oil out for reason X" When you see a ban like this you have to ask why so much genuine shite isn't banned.
2252 2018-11-09 20:20:19 Think ours have only recently in last month got it in as I used to shop at Iceland, well still do, but haven't for about 6 weeks as used Asda more recently but think I'll go back to Iceland just for the removal of palm oil. Everything I look at has it in & makes me so sad

2270 2018-11-09 20:18:45 While I am sympathetic to their cause, the same rules preventing their campaign being broadcast are the same rules that prevent a counter campaign by the pro palm oil industry being broadcast. Who decides what is the "right" message? Better a blanket ban on political campaigns.
2271 2018-11-09 20:18:44 i am looking for an illustrator for a children's book too!! (early readers not YA) who are you recommending? (i need wispy water color/oil pastels/chalk with pen and ink style mixed media.)
2272 2018-11-09 20:18:42 Also quite tasty and close to zero carbs.

I added fresh tomatoes with oregano and olive oil (not selo oils!!would love to try it).
2273 2018-11-09 20:18:41 Not good enough @Tesco ! By 2020 there'll be hardly any rainforest left & practically no orangutan. You clearly don't care about habitat destruction just profit. RSPO palm oil is a nonsense. Certification of farms happens after rainforest had been cleared #Greenwashing #PalmOil
2274 2018-11-09 20:18:36 I didn’t know they had an oil free. I definitely need this #1111TreatYourselfOlay #contests

2276 2018-11-09 20:18:34 Claire should have seen with her own eyes how much those poor farmers in borneo rely on Palm oil to survive. Yes orang Utans need protection but human need to survive too. If she is against large plantations then please aim the campaign that way.

2298 2018-11-09 20:16:26 Well that’s the thing. The Keystone pipeline is not for us.  It’s just a vehicle to transport oil from Canada to the gulf for refinery so they don’t have to use trucks. The oil is not ours. And we don’t have first dibs to it.  Republicans are in pockets of big business.
2299 2018-11-09 20:16:10 Looking for some customers reviews who’s bought my cbd oil if you read then & you have purchased from me could you kindly leave a review please. Just want to make everyone aware how good mine is compared to a lot of crap out there what don’t even work or most likely fake
2300 2018-11-09 20:16:07 I'm always rational. I'm just not always agreeable.
2301 2018-11-09 20:16:02 According to Google, coca cola is a very good toilet cleaner.

La casera is used by mechanics to wash off grease and engine oil.

Fam, what is your stomach lining made of, you coca cola fan?
2302 2018-11-09 20:15:51 Though mebbe we'll show Nation: Norway. Some interesting insights re oil/renewables etc.
2303 2018-11-09 20:15:43 14yr long oil leak off the Louisiana coast in the Gulf of Mexico has been leaking 300-700 or more, barrels of oil, per day, since 2004 at a site where an oil production platform owned by #TaylorEnergy sank during Hurricane Ivan.  These companies just don’t give a fuck!
2304 2018-11-09 20:15:30 I have always found this to be an unlikely explanation. Though I suppose that impetus from the oil lobby may have played a role, I think other geopolitical forces are at play.
2305 2018-11-09 20:15:25 And Play !
2306 2018-11-09 20:15:11 Consider adding Parsnips that you cut up to french fry size bake in extra virgin light oil with spices and nobody can taste the difference between a real french fry & a Parsnip. Same goes for Cauliflower mashed potatoes vs real mashed potatoes impossible to taste the diff.
2307 2018-11-09 20:14:56 While I highly doubt that is happening, I'm wondering what is going on 1060 W. Addison.

We've went from gotta pay to fix the offense to fire all the coaches to fix the offense, to trade to fix the offense.

In the meantime the pitching staff is leaking oil also.
2308 2018-11-09 20:14:55 My uneducated guess is that the expansion will continue for a while absent severe fed rate hikes or an oil supply shock but also that there's also a real housing bubble esp in California

2310 2018-11-09 20:14:54 After watching the Iceland advert I’m now checking everything to make sure it doesn’t have palm oil in. Please do the same and help save our rainforests and orangoutangs #IcelandAdvert
2311 2018-11-09 20:14:50 The company #GlaxoSmithKline conducted a study of fish oil drug Lovaza for 7 years on 15+ thousand patients. No result. Research on #Vascepa 8+ thousand patients. And of course no results, because it's #justfishoil. #amrn $amrn #aha18 #Fabricated #ClinicalTrialFake #FDA
2312 2018-11-09 20:14:47 It’s amazing how people forget that animal agriculture also causes deforestation, isn’t it? It’s fine to be outraged about palm oil pushing species to the brink of extinction, but we can do so much more than just cutting out palm oil products.
2313 2018-11-09 20:14:42 Luke the oil companies broadcast 24/7 their myth& their propaganda; car adverts are everywhere and they arent elecrdic cars.please other than thay you are right about how the whole thing works. Bit dont tell me that the car and petrol giants dont have a political/economic message

2320 2018-11-09 20:13:59 They've already explained it was part of the Greenpeace ad compaign which they asked to use. The main thing is - they are trying to phase out palm oil. GOOD. In exchange, I'll retweet *their* ad.

2327 2018-11-09 20:13:11 Eh bien c'est un dérivé du mot cape, de l'occitan capa, qui vient du latin cappa "manteau, cape", mais on est pas totalement sûre que cappa vienne de caput. En français (d'oïl) le mot cappa a donné "une chape", et également "chaperon" !

2335 2018-11-09 20:12:26 oil too
2336 2018-11-09 20:12:26 @Tesco hey tesco when are you going to stop using palm oil in products that don't need it? i mean, lebkuchen hearts? do they need palm oil?  ridiculous.
2337 2018-11-09 20:12:17 Or....that Bell South ran all the communication lines for the Nazis...Standard Oil sold them all the oil and gas. Disney kicked in a little too..
It's always about money first.
2338 2018-11-09 20:12:04 @IcelandFoods love the advert, signed petition, and I'll be shopping with you more because of your palm oil stance. Thank you for taking a stand

2342 2018-11-09 20:11:49 I have retweeted this a few times now. It’s hard to buy goods without palm oil but I’m trying.
2343 2018-11-09 20:11:47 I started using coconut oil then use a organic soap bar to wash off the oil and I try not to use any waterproof mascara

2346 2018-11-09 20:11:40 @SeanAstin hello Sean, here in the uk there is a food retailer @IcelandFoods. They chose to use their Christmas tv advert to highlight the damage palm oil production is doing to our planet. They have been banned from airing on the grounds it’s too politician 1/2
2347 2018-11-09 20:11:37 Basically rojava can host US military bases and help split a sovereign country from its oil resources but China can’t acknowledge a chief architect of opening diplomatic relations with the US

2350 2018-11-09 20:11:30 Wow this is such an important message and it’s banned?  Thanks so much for doing this and making the pledge to remove palm oil from your products.
2351 2018-11-09 20:11:29 Do you also complain about how your money goes to fighting wars we shouldn't be in or giving billions of dollars of aid to other countries that actually have government healthcare for their people? Or that billions a year goes to subsidize oil, animal ag and the like? 
2352 2018-11-09 20:11:28 #Iceland Christmas TV advert has been banned for being "too political."
 
It raises awareness about the destruction of the rainforests. If we keep on cutting down palm trees in the rainforests for palm oil at the rate we currently are then the Orangutans will be extinct in 8yrs.
2353 2018-11-09 20:11:26 (2/2) that they'll be making the "ethical choice" if they buy animal products that don't contain palm oil. That's NO different from promoting the "free-range" shit. How the fuck can you, as a vegan, not see that?
2354 2018-11-09 20:11:17 That's like everything else .property tax cut but new/raised fees on garbage licensing etc. chock us on gas prices for long periods and and drop it by ten cents and make it seem like it's cheap when in fact the cost of crude oil is the same as in 2006 but pay 3.50 to 2.50 in gas
2355 2018-11-09 20:11:13 Because palm oil has such a cute front runner. And palm oil doesn’t bring an individual’s personal values into account as much as animal agriculture, so they’re far happier focusing on the other issue. Plus BIG BUSINESS. I think both are equally important matters
2356 2018-11-09 20:11:10 Of cooking oil.
2357 2018-11-09 20:11:10 I love the Broken Coast CBD Oil

2359 2018-11-09 20:11:08 #IcelandAdvert  I did hear a vegetable oil industry worker on the radio today say that palm is 4 x more productive than its next best replacement which is rapeseed or others, which in real terms means that if we get rid of palm the big instant food industry will just replace it

You need to get your oil changed!

2361 2018-11-09 20:10:59 Shortfalls are due to property value drops which is related to vacancies downtown, next. not a planning issue per say. Oil companies built all the buildings?

yes Nenshi, we get it there are people who think he is horrible.
2362 2018-11-09 20:10:50 This ppl aren't encouraging DJ cuppy to improve, but rather telling her that music is not her thing, she can get better with the right motivation and support pls, @cuppymusic don't let them copy your career into extinction.
2363 2018-11-09 20:10:44 Plastic, palm oil, Japan and China. Nothing more fucked up than that combo
2364 2018-11-09 20:10:42 Hi @doveUK what about Palm Oil? Are all your soaps and shampoo’s Palm Oil free??
2365 2018-11-09 20:10:34 Hopefully we get same after 11 December, with oil prices..no pressure 
2366 2018-11-09 20:10:34 Solid call on that whole, "rising oil prices", narrative.
2367 2018-11-09 20:10:33 I pay like $70 for mine but i have a Volkswagen so i don’t need to replace my oil for like 10,000 miles. That’s why i asked if it was a foreign car ... that’s crazy smh lol
2368 2018-11-09 20:10:32 Anyone else feel your car runs so much better after oil changes?

But I still enjoy the thrill of seeing how long I can go before I get an oil change....
2369 2018-11-09 20:10:31 Like 11 bottles of tanning oil that expired 20 years ago along with the subway pizza rat?
2370 2018-11-09 20:10:29 Please, think about this for one second. Iceland Foods sells ANIMAL PRODUCTS, and here they are, telling people that in order for them to make the "ethical choice", they need to buy products free from palm oil. In other words, they're telling their consumers that... (1/2)
2371 2018-11-09 20:10:27 @LUSH_AusNZ are products palm oil free?
2372 2018-11-09 20:10:26 wish I could rub oil on ur gorgeous body
2373 2018-11-09 20:10:20 Finally found time to change the oil on the subie.

Just looked & our Iceland has 29 of their no bull or no chick etc range in our local shop. That's massive! With the palm oil advert I think they're winning x

2378 2018-11-09 20:10:01 Everyone will increasingly paying for #carbontax upcharge through their groceries. 

The world grain market is very competitive, just like oil. NOBODY out there is willing to pay extra for our useless virtue signals.

But they willingly crush our markets where ever they can. 
2379 2018-11-09 20:10:01 I need to make an appointment to get my oil changed, but I don’t want to be an adult and talk on the phone
2380 2018-11-09 20:09:36 I have a better idea, invest in something other than oil. Technology, mining, or whatever - it doesn't matter, just not something that has its value decided by the whims of a cartel.
2381 2018-11-09 20:09:35 Democrats are using minority groups to pass their fracking through.

They have the perfect game plan because if you go against a gay man for his fracking record,they will call you anti-gay.  

It is the perfect sneaky plan to keep us at war for fracking & oil.
2382 2018-11-09 20:09:24 The wait to get your oil change is equivalent to going to the dmv
2383 2018-11-09 20:09:13 Oil prices have fallen up to 20% on the world market yet in #Zambia and #Africa pump prices are at the highest levels in history causing a rise in goods and services prices which is a negative effect for developing countries

2391 2018-11-09 20:08:18 We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified. Thanks - Melissa
2392 2018-11-09 20:08:18 Iceland has just gone palm oil free, so a good candidate!

2394 2018-11-09 20:08:09 Reading between the lines Navarro justifies HFT sell bombing strategic commodities (gold, silver, oil) by the State as a matter of National Security. It's price controls & Not Cool & will lead to chaotic price increases (for those who survive).
2395 2018-11-09 20:08:06 I’m FURIOUS that the Iceland Xmas ad has been banned from TVs. Highlighting the fact that palm oil contributes to rainforest destruction (equivalent to 300 football fields/hr) is “too political”?? Our fight for a functioning, viable biosphere shouldn’t even be a political issue.
2396 2018-11-09 20:08:01 Why did you pay $100 for an oil change lol they must’ve put some crazy oil in there unless you have a foreign car lol
2397 2018-11-09 20:07:51 @mrjamesob please talk about Iceland’s banned advert. Hard hitting video yes, but we need this, especially as adults turn a blind eye to it. There isn’t some subversive complaints via companies that use palm oil for their products going on is there?
2398 2018-11-09 20:07:46 Poor execution I guess but we did all that and came away empty handed because of incompetent leadership. We should be operating their oil fields and using the profits to pay back resources spent on the invasion.

2400 2018-11-09 20:07:33 They stopped using palm oil in their own products
2401 2018-11-09 20:07:32 I fully understand this palm oil is not good and they are hurting and killing the Orangutan so much. #disgusting  but the video will be sent everywhere for people.
2402 2018-11-09 20:07:32 We are Canada. One of the largest oil producers on earth. You need our oil. We could and can sell it elsewhere.
2403 2018-11-09 20:07:29 There hasn't been a day I've been canvassing where it wasn't brought up at least once. Often it's brought up as part of conversations relating to pipelines, oil and gas, and the carbon tax. The frequency really depends what area you're in.
2404 2018-11-09 20:07:21 I think it's super sad that #Iceland have had their wonderfully emotional Christmas advert about palm oil banned, and yet it's totally cool to advertise ridiculous beauty standards etc all over the shop with no repercussions.
2405 2018-11-09 20:07:20 Get well soon, Nathalie. And all best for Sunday. I have oil permanently by the bed - just in case.
2406 2018-11-09 20:07:14 The short answer would be, palm oil is cheep and it would fuck many well known household brands with a barbed wire baseball bat up the arse if they reformulated products with an alternative. Therefore they don't want the facts highlighted
2407 2018-11-09 20:07:07 @IcelandFoods Congratulations on highlighting the palm oil issue. I cannot wait for you guys to get started on the cruelty of the fishing industry and industrial animal farming
2408 2018-11-09 20:07:04 The oil that will flow through the XL pipeline will not go in our tanks. It will be loaded on tankers in Houston and be shipped to China. It's the whole purpose of the project. We won't get any of it. We already produce most of what we use.

2422 2018-11-09 20:06:31 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
2423 2018-11-09 20:06:23 Ford no more sedans. Adds focus on electric. BMW backs the same electric company as Ford. Crude oil stock down.  .
2424 2018-11-09 20:06:13 He is talking about Iwi? Oil companies are certainly not ignored. This guy seems to be a charlatan.
2425 2018-11-09 20:05:35 Avoid buying products with palm oil.
2426 2018-11-09 20:05:30 I HATE coming to get my oil changed, they take forever. 
2427 2018-11-09 20:05:27 I’ve been at this dealership since 12. It doesn’t take 2 hours to do an oil change and rotate some tires
2428 2018-11-09 20:05:25 How. I don't know how and I like u rayne and will not mute you. We need you on topic. I understand about pain and how pot helps. It is illegal here but I tried it worked. But i need oil with no thc for day and thc at night. Please
2429 2018-11-09 20:05:19 You know what I see. A corrupt government selling the oil for dirt cheap deals for money under the table, foreigners taking all the jobs, no Somali benefiting from it except the handful elite.
2430 2018-11-09 20:05:15 Just that. No branded rice, gari and oil attached?
2431 2018-11-09 20:05:15 Actually because Scotland is in the union the oil is shared. It is UK oil. Also I believe Norway produces more oil than the UK.
2432 2018-11-09 20:05:14 Iceland claims to not be against palm oil, but if that’s the case they need to buck up and stop taking the easy way and give poor farmers a chance. They could work with governments instead and find out which farms are not continuously deforesting. But of course, what do we care.
2433 2018-11-09 20:05:14 Wayyo number na nawa ne Kai a layi 
2434 2018-11-09 20:05:07 just made ramen that is so thick with miso, it might stand on its own outside the bowl. Also my eyes are watering from the chili oil so I am making excellent choices.
2435 2018-11-09 20:05:01 Have you ever tried CBD oil?
2436 2018-11-09 20:04:55 Ya because we don't need Middle east oil.
2437 2018-11-09 20:04:54 Aye, but since most of the oil is counted as from an unspecified region, it hardly counts.
2438 2018-11-09 20:04:53 I’m assuming it’s supposed to be a small child’s mispronunciation but you aren’t wrong. Also, now I’m not buying anything with palm oil in it.
2439 2018-11-09 20:04:49 Instead of filling my hungry belly for lunch I’m getting my oil changed. Is this what adulting is? Because I don’t want it.
2440 2018-11-09 20:04:35 @realDonaldTrump What are markets, media, financial experts not understanding? If they listen to you, maybe they could figure out what's really going on behind the scenes. Called level the playing field in currency, oil, economics, trade. Did you not say, "we got a world to run?"
2441 2018-11-09 20:04:27 Weren’t they profitable when oil was ~$40?
2442 2018-11-09 20:04:23 @Ocado in light of Iceland's commitment to ditch all palm oil from its products, 1) will you follow suit, and 2) what are you doing to reduce the (high) amount of single-use plastic in your products?
2443 2018-11-09 20:04:12 I'm doing a #DailyDouble on #CBD oil to combat #RedCannabisAnxiety syndrome
2444 2018-11-09 20:04:11 Palm oil doesn't make a good whale meat stir-fry is probably why
2445 2018-11-09 20:04:09 Purpose soap & vitamin e oil daily. Wash face atleast 2-3 times a day! Best things i use for my skin. The aztec mask with organic apple cider vinegar is also good to use every now & then to.
2446 2018-11-09 20:04:09 Anybody looking for oil
2447 2018-11-09 20:04:09 So when are you banning all the charity adverts, RSPCA, WWF, The Donkey Charity, etc.  Iceland are showing an explanation for their business decision to remove palm oil from their shelves.  That is a business matter and a wildlife preservation matter, not a political matter.
2448 2018-11-09 20:04:00 Then marginal increased growth until next rate hike or oil prices rise again..!
2449 2018-11-09 20:04:00 Experts love whipsawing oil.
The overall economy is better with a stable price.
Short term a nice sharp trend is more profitable.
2450 2018-11-09 20:03:56 What's wrong bro? Black seed oil is amazing doe your immune system. Take some. Feel better 
2451 2018-11-09 20:03:49 The #mograph industry doesn’t have a particularly high bar for morality. I even got looped into to doing work for an oil company 5 years ago that I’m STILL ashamed of to this day. But challenging a woman’s right to choose has GOT to be below us as an industry right? RIGHT!?!?!
2452 2018-11-09 20:03:48 Selling #audnok into this retracement....#nok is still cheap even with #oil in the $50s
2453 2018-11-09 20:03:47 I used to use crushed aspirin with water, but ima try the tea tree oil. Thank you so much! 
2454 2018-11-09 20:03:47 Why don't they use the oil revenues you mentioned earlier
2455 2018-11-09 20:03:34 My skin loves coconut oil! It thinks we are back in Thailand!
2456 2018-11-09 20:03:30 A shoutout to @redlianak . Pseudo-science has been around pretty much since the beginning of actual science. The only difference is that now we can go and check to see if something is the real deal or a new brand of snake oil.
2457 2018-11-09 20:03:30 >< Had to change oil, rent new tires till I can slowly pay them off, ww fluid sprayer isn't working, and I think we need new brakes soon. When you need a miracle rofl.
2458 2018-11-09 20:03:02 They contribute like 10 billion to CAs economy allegedly, which is like a 3 trillion dollar economy. So they can suck my cock. Figure out how to pipe water in like they do oil or grow something else. I’m with you. Fucking Big Almond
2459 2018-11-09 20:02:59 But Scott Pruitt renting a fucking couch for $50 from an oil lobbyist is ok according to @FoxNews.  Til he fell behind and got kicked out by them anyways. True story.

EVERY person in Congress representing the people should have a similar dilemma but their over 50% millionaires.
2460 2018-11-09 20:02:54 God this made me really cry
Just a few days earlier, in my state they destroyed one of the staple mountains to dig for oil and compromised the enviroment and species of the zone a lot
2461 2018-11-09 20:02:52 WTI oil settles at $60.19 a barrel, down for a 10th consecutive day -- the longest streak of daily losses since the contract was launched 35 years ago. :BBG
2462 2018-11-09 20:02:49 I was completely oblivious to the use of palm oil and it's effects, until watching this advert. Seems like the government's mouth piece the bbc, is siding with big business.
2463 2018-11-09 20:02:48 Yes! Slice thin triangles (thickness of a quarter of a block, dab with paper towel to remove moisture, then fry in pan with sesame oil or other oil of your choice and sea salt until lightly browned. It took me a long time to get this too! Dress with whatever sauce you want.
2464 2018-11-09 20:02:48 Uganda's oil is important but #Namawojjolo is importanter.
2465 2018-11-09 20:02:45 And Ted Turner - well known conservation philanthropist - is part of the problem here, as @Turner is a founder of @Clearcast . @TedTurnerIII - you need to look into this banning of the @IcelandFoods palm oil awareness ad.
2466 2018-11-09 20:02:38 Hot bath with lavender oil.
2467 2018-11-09 20:02:34 Coconut oil or Olive oil 
2468 2018-11-09 20:02:30 Oil [Brent] is 20% down from its highs.
2469 2018-11-09 20:02:28 This advert has literally nothing to do with Christmas. It’s not a Christmas Advert It’s an appeal against the use of palm oil, which shouldn’t be banned anyway.
2470 2018-11-09 20:02:22 Lol they just said it was running low on oil but no oil leak
2471 2018-11-09 20:02:18 Iceland did not make the Rang-tang film it was done by Greenpeace sometime ago. Greenpeace gave Iceland permission to use it to promote their palm oil free products. It seems it was banned because of the connection to Greenpeace and that it was deemed“political”
2472 2018-11-09 20:02:14 Don’t get laid till next Friday only have $5 to survive with till then thanks to a leaking oil pan. $DRabino
2473 2018-11-09 20:02:14 I have some essential oil for that
2474 2018-11-09 20:02:11 We have a super special sale on the Super Lemon Haze half gram cartridge by Golden Oil! Grab this sativa distillate for only $28.35 today!
2475 2018-11-09 20:02:06 Palm oil causes de-forestation
2476 2018-11-09 20:02:03 Which one of my friends sells CBD oil?
2477 2018-11-09 20:02:03 Their goal isn't to sell at the top and buy at the bottom. They're hedging physical oil exposure/risk. Their value as an indicator is when they develop extreme positions. You still need other timing tools, of course.
2478 2018-11-09 20:01:59 Use the growth data based on  new series for pre 2015 era
>
also add crude oil price data in this
2479 2018-11-09 20:01:53 Jerk Turkey & Gouda Sub on Italian 5 grain, pressed, with yellow American, oil & vinegar, banana peppers, green peppers, mayonnaise, and double meat
2480 2018-11-09 20:01:42 Indeed, I do. Likewise. Just remember who supplies your nation with 41% of its oil...that would be awful if that got shut off.
2481 2018-11-09 20:01:21 
2482 2018-11-09 20:01:17 You deregulated safety standards and pushed coal and oil when renewable energy and proper stewardship of the environment were needed most. You let everyone but your friends in industry down. Shame!
2483 2018-11-09 20:01:09 The oil block don dey block thinking
2484 2018-11-09 20:01:06 Keynes was proposing something more radical years ago. As a young lad the view was the country would get a four day week on the back of North Sea Oil. Thatcher of course had different ideas about who should benefit
2485 2018-11-09 20:00:57 The oil will still flow. Just now it will be in trains. Which leak far more often than pipelines. Also carrying the risk of derailment and exploding. Plus the impact of all the diesel burned to move the trains.
2486 2018-11-09 20:00:57 Who do you think you are? Jeremy Corbyn?

The radio stated palm oil was a much more efficient source of oil compared to next largest source, rape seed oil, with a 4 x greater yield. A substitute might cause greater environmental damage?
2487 2018-11-09 20:00:34 When you brown ground beef, do you put oil in the pan too or just throw the meat in and heat it up?
2488 2018-11-09 20:00:31 Palm oil always sounds a lot more fun to me than it is.
2489 2018-11-09 20:00:30 #USA, #Russia and #Saudi_Arabia together now produce 33 million barrel of oil per day. A new record. One could convert these to record levels of #GHG emissions.
2490 2018-11-09 20:00:07 Shame and ridiculous. Will we not see Oxfam adverts either by the same rationale? Maybe members of the advertising commission have shares MacDonalds ( massive user of unsustainable palm oil).
2491 2018-11-09 20:00:00 Bruscetta;

2492 2018-11-09 20:00:00 Coconut oil sis
2493 2018-11-09 19:59:59 Agreed thanks. Not a fan of palm oil myself either, obv the orangutans,  but also because it's legal to dump it in the sea which ends up leaving fatbergs on the beaches which can kill dogs and animals.  #NoPalmOilChristmas
2494 2018-11-09 19:59:59 today at Buhimba Technical Institute for oil en gas skills
2495 2018-11-09 19:59:46 I just put my oil change on a nonexistent tab and left the service center I love me
2496 2018-11-09 19:59:26 Poke bowl is just deconstructed sushi

Vermicelli is deconstructed spring rolls
 
Spaghetti is deconstructed lasagna

Water is deconstructed ice

Oil is deconstructed dinosaurs
2497 2018-11-09 19:59:25 In the 2016 Election I was hot rocks by so pull the pudding in Florida that Broward County, which was play hoop snake boobs with vote tabulation and probably getting unready to do a “number,” couldn’t do it because not gonads nuts recorded in Broward for them to oil of man a rag!
2498 2018-11-09 19:59:14 Hello we are MaxTechnoPump we are a pumping company that does many different jobs. Like for gold/minerals or oil. We can guarantee 100% satisfaction
2499 2018-11-09 19:59:14 I have recently started to have problem with that logic: how come that the whole thing is about commemorating those who died, but the money go to a military entity? It's like Greenpeace would run an oil platform.
2500 2018-11-09 19:59:11 So you get content for the price of a tax write off and your capping it at 150k? So you’re hella cheap when it comes to charity AND you’re destroying the planet? Social media person at Chevron, are you really comfortable working for the oil industry?
2501 2018-11-09 19:59:09 I've never used a special moisturizing lotion. What's it called? I use baby oil the first day, then Tend Skin to avoid ingrown hairs. (I can't use Tend Skin the first day, though friends of mine have no problem.)
2502 2018-11-09 19:59:03 I may be cynical, but they probably knew it would be banned and they’ve got much more publicity for Iceland and the Palm Oil cause by going this way.
Quite a clever bit of PR... #Iceland
2503 2018-11-09 19:58:59 I hate them all much prefer a balsamic vinegar, olive oil & Dijon mustard or just oil & lemon lol
2504 2018-11-09 19:58:59 How you gonna say fish oil is snake oil?
2505 2018-11-09 19:58:38 Third post of the day complete. I took a lunch break and ate greens cooked with olive oil and vinegar, topped with hot sauce, and pinto beans cooked with ham. It was delicious and another good thing crossed my mind: often inexpensive food is super delicious.
2506 2018-11-09 19:58:31 It was good for the global banking syndicates who profited from it in no small terms. Oil and mineral industry was redrawn after fall of Tsar. Soviet Union began process of more sustained industrialisation. More commercial opportunities all round.
2507 2018-11-09 19:58:30 I would be tempted. I see only increasing supply and decreasing demand for oil.
2508 2018-11-09 19:58:28 Is it the palm oil one?
2509 2018-11-09 19:58:27 Trudeau’s dad nationalized a oil company because the Arabs cut oil off & USA  screwed Canada. He called it Petro Canada. Oil was so scarce Oil went from Alberta to BC ports through Panama Canal & up to Ont & Que. Fast forward to 2018 & still no East PipelineIt’s funny as hell
2510 2018-11-09 19:58:24 Yeah that's my point. Why do it if you aren't going to get the oil?
2511 2018-11-09 19:58:06 Was cooking wors and the oil burnt me so I rubbed it.
2512 2018-11-09 19:58:06 @jiffylube - thanks for the rip off oil change. I guess its back to doing it myself. $102 for a simple oil change?
2513 2018-11-09 19:58:05 Curley from of mice and men's glove was never filled with vaseline, he just had a brass hand and his glove was filled with brass hand oil
2514 2018-11-09 19:57:59 Is that why you're now shouting?
2515 2018-11-09 19:57:58 You're fine. Oil us just for looks
2516 2018-11-09 19:57:56 Make sure you guys change your oil sm. My engine froze over
2517 2018-11-09 19:57:54 waxen faced tony blaire that waxen face wet with crocodile tears and protistations over his illegal little oil war if there's something with more brass neck than blaire its on display at sutherbies
2518 2018-11-09 19:57:47 Reasonable, common sense
2519 2018-11-09 19:57:45 I guess you are Fulani, El rufai is Fulani, Buhari is Fulani, Atiku is Fulani. What do you guys have in common
2520 2018-11-09 19:57:44 Anyone else who expects Scott to break into a “Beds are Burning” rendition at any moment?  And sorry for the comparison Midnight Oil, you fought for the oppressed and Scott actively oppresses.
2521 2018-11-09 19:57:42 The not taking the oil was totally unforgivable in my opinion. We were in control of the country at great expense we should at least have taken the oil.
2522 2018-11-09 19:57:35 U.S. oil benchmark settles at lowest since March, loses nearly 5% for the week
2523 2018-11-09 19:57:30 When Arabs began to ‘re-price’ their oil to compensate for western shenanigans with ‘monetary’ practice, it was portrayed as ‘Arabs cornering westerners.’ Complete rubbish. Western fiat was imposed on Arabs...
2524 2018-11-09 19:57:20  ohhh man it's going to take forever to get those oil stains
2525 2018-11-09 19:57:17 NFA, Hughes amendment, etc. I find it funny that he talks about gun reform, while admitting he broke a Cali gun law in the same tweet.
2526 2018-11-09 19:57:10 brent oil price is 70$+  not 60$
2527 2018-11-09 19:57:09 On this beans and sniper issue

Nothing can stop me from getting my dose of beans
I love beans

There's no sniper that can affect me once that beans has been baptized in ewa agoin sauce......with the oil

2528 2018-11-09 19:57:09 @IcelandFoods good first steps but we have stopped buying Nutella and notice you are still selling it and a number of other products containing palm oil what are you going to do about that? #IcelandAdvert
2529 2018-11-09 19:57:09 I cant get cbd oil in my country so I’ll have to go to one of my neighbor countries for it but lorazepam honestly helps me sm i was addicted to it for a few months without realising it so that was rlly tough
2530 2018-11-09 19:57:08 I have baked my heart for you to make a DIYA,

To lit it,

I use my blood as oil and longing as thread,

2531 2018-11-09 19:56:57 My CBD oil is working!!
2532 2018-11-09 19:56:53 Iceland needsto work with substainable palm oil companies if they really care. At the moment they’re destructing the livelihood of small farmers who have nothing to do with deforestation. Their move is a lazy one.
2533 2018-11-09 19:56:47 I need my coconut and black castor oil to grow back my edges. @chloexhalle performance snap them all away 
2534 2018-11-09 19:56:37 @scifri does white truffle oil actually have truffle essence or just chemicals that mimic the flavor?

2536 2018-11-09 19:56:32 Give me a break. She’s a liberal activist with an agenda and doesn’t give 2 shits about the constitution. But that’s why you like her.
2537 2018-11-09 19:56:29 if you’re moisturizing your body with anything other than 100% organically derived oil (avacado, coconut, jojoba, olive) my question is: why don’t you love yourself?
2538 2018-11-09 19:56:26 Why does it feel like a quiz when they tell you to turn on your turn signals when getting your oil changed? I really have to think about where my turn signal is
2539 2018-11-09 19:56:23 Based on life experience, the only thing more valuable per ounce than Gold or Oil is the Blue Cheese sauce that comes with Buffalo Wings.

2541 2018-11-09 19:56:20 did you wash your face with oil?? 
2542 2018-11-09 19:56:18 But it's raising awareness of the destruction of habitat for unsustainable palm oil, and if they remove it, that's a good thing, no?
2543 2018-11-09 19:56:15 It would be good to hear from whoever decided to ban this ad the reasons for that decision....they clearly don’t care about the welfare of the animals affected by this obsession with palm oil
2544 2018-11-09 19:56:09 @meinekecarcare are you helping vets this year with free oil changes nationwide.
2545 2018-11-09 19:55:56 Luckily the oil industry got many city council members elected in refinery towns here in the bay so climate change can keep on trucking!
2546 2018-11-09 19:55:54 Geographical share of oil revenue is attributed to Scotland.
2547 2018-11-09 19:55:52 Mmmhhhh fresh tomatosauce, extra vergine olive oil, delicious herbs, some seafood to go along and homemade fresh pasta... how can you say no to that ;-)
2548 2018-11-09 19:55:49 Green zero is buying crude oil calls for June 2019 with 10x leverage.
2549 2018-11-09 19:55:37 If we had a competent president during the Iraq war we would have captured the oil and use it to pay back some of the military expenses or at least make it symbolic.
2550 2018-11-09 19:55:29 And no gasoline or oil leaked into the creek either!!!
2551 2018-11-09 19:55:18 Terrifying eh. On that note I'll take my cod liver oil.
2552 2018-11-09 19:55:13 I did t know Oil Preachers were a thing until now
2553 2018-11-09 19:55:13 Not sure where you've been living, because many of our politicians are bought and paid for by big business, especially the NRA, Phama, Oil, etc...
2554 2018-11-09 19:55:13 There's a caveat though, right? Economic prosperity BY WAY of oil, is really only what @NMforEP cares about. Every time I mention marijuana legalization all I get from you guys is crickets. Just be transparent. Be open about the fact that this is a pro-fossil fuels account.
2555 2018-11-09 19:55:02 Yummy yes this lunch!!!! Easy breezy pezzy! Mixed field green, tomatoes, avocados, 4Tbsp rice wine vinegar, splash of soy sauce, 1/2tsp soybean oil, splash olive oil, pink sea salt, hot chili  peppers, diced, fresh cracked pepper- easy 3 min- iced cold filtered water w mineral
2556 2018-11-09 19:54:48 NO it wouldn’t. That’s garbage oil. That’s headed for the coast to be ship overseas. It’s extracted from sand. It’s shit. The money is off leases.
2557 2018-11-09 19:54:44 The American just like our cheap oil and think they can control it! Oh...ya we have that idiot Trudeau that runs Canada these days...disaster after disaster! Build the pipeline, Canadians need it to survive!

2561 2018-11-09 19:54:41 ‘The three day week’ was introduced in 1973 at the same time as ‘the oil crisis’ and Nixon’s ‘gold shock.’ These shocks had nothing to do with gold or oil but ‘monetary fiat.’
2562 2018-11-09 19:54:41 Oh has flora got palm oil in it? That’s what we have.
2563 2018-11-09 19:54:38 Thats crazy omg I’m on 3 lorezepam a day but it never stops the panic attack it usually prevents them from happening more regularly but since it takes 15-60 minutes to kick in the only thing that helps fast is the cbd oil
2564 2018-11-09 19:54:33 No they weren't. Like LBJ riding on the emotion of JFK's death to attack Vietnam the NEOCONS counted on emotion from the towers to blind people. I wasn't one of them. And the war wasn't fought for oil, it was fought to steal US taxpayer funds and for poppy fields in Afghanistan.
2565 2018-11-09 19:54:06 Who wants to swap dependancy on one inefficient liquid fuel , with costs determined by monopolies to another, erm big oil? I gave great fuel at home that takes 4 seconds, called a plug socket, wake up and another 110 miles all ready to go(and newest do 200-300miles) #foolcells 
2566 2018-11-09 19:54:03 Twice a month I cook this.....and yes I do add a few Methidana in Tarka.....and a few more recipes which you would like to have right now.... Alu baingan tamatar, alu Gobhi without too much masala, where Gobhi is first fried in mustard oil....
2567 2018-11-09 19:54:02 Midday hot oil treatment, then wash and condition #twa #naturalhair 

Then random I want a grilled cheese+turkey pepperoni

2569 2018-11-09 19:53:58 US crude oil posts longest losing streak in over 34 years, falling for 10th day ... question is, where do we go from here after the Sunday meeting #crude #WTI #crudeoil $cl_f #brentoil
2570 2018-11-09 19:53:50 TWO STROKE MIX THE GAS WITH THE OIL
2571 2018-11-09 19:53:50 girl argan oil and main and tail shampoo and conditioner. a great duo
2572 2018-11-09 19:53:44 A native woman who DOESNT make the fry bread oil or dough pop is a demi-goddess in my opinion.
2573 2018-11-09 19:53:42 I'm going to be honest. I have no pity for Ichihoshi. Okay, Kidou's solution isn't the best one. Though, Kidou tried to talk and change things with the kantoku, who just put more oil to the fire than Kidou did. Hiroto and Haizaki could answer no. Kidou didn't oblige them..
2574 2018-11-09 19:53:36 Jeff Duncan won't be happy until every racist in SC is swimming neck-deep in oil at Myrtle Beach. Weirdly, this is what he needs for personal validation.
2575 2018-11-09 19:53:33 We made a commitment at the start of this year to remove palm oil from all own label food products by the end of 2018.
2576 2018-11-09 19:53:26 Bottlenecks everywhere -- Alberta minister says province has asked Canadian government for more #oil tank cars to increase #crude-by-rail shipments
2577 2018-11-09 19:53:04 It took me a second to realize oil wasn’t walking into a supermarket for bears
2578 2018-11-09 19:52:50 Okay but for real how bad is it to put off an oil change??
2579 2018-11-09 19:52:43 Oil Nana. Lmaooooodhdjd
2580 2018-11-09 19:52:27 @LVServices Hi There- I was just gifted a new bag!  How do you recommend I care for it/clean it?  Is it ok to use mink oil?
2581 2018-11-09 19:52:26 @CostaCoffee this link no longer works - have you got new data on what products contain palm oil pls? And how it’s sourced
2582 2018-11-09 19:52:19 Oh they already did that yesterday. Disgustingly blamed the GOP & big oil. Any excuse to be dix. So sad at a time like this.
2583 2018-11-09 19:52:14 Every time I'm in Walmart waiting for my oil change I think about @VenusEnvyDrag
2584 2018-11-09 19:52:04 no oil or nun
2585 2018-11-09 19:52:02 Olive oil, it’ll rip all kf the moisture out of yor throat and hurt like no other but I won’t kill you
2586 2018-11-09 19:52:01 Not our fault you don't have oil money
2587 2018-11-09 19:51:55 Getting my oil changed, just left my sexual health presentation and have a whole bag of condoms on my front seat. 
2588 2018-11-09 19:51:51 cold weather hates my dry af skin and i cant find a single vegan cf face oil that's not like £30 help
2589 2018-11-09 19:51:50 Think it's about time all the food producers stopped using palm oil and it's up to the big supermarkets @Tesco @asda @Morrisons @sainsburys etc to take a stand like to hear from the supermarkets there thoughts @susannareid100 Monday topic please
2590 2018-11-09 19:51:41 everyone pls check for palm oil before  buying ur products, we HAVE to protect our rainforests ! takes 1 min to find a different product to help save the precious species that WE originated from !!! (remember most cruelty free products also contain palm oil ://)
2591 2018-11-09 19:51:41 Well, in Dutch it is technically called rapeseed oil: raapzaadolie. But “raap” doesn’t have the same meaning in English as rape. Other than the plant of course.
2592 2018-11-09 19:51:41 Can I take a moment to send a  HUGE thankyou not only for the beautifully touching ad, but for educating me? I had no idea this is happening today...Or the steps you're taking to ensure your foods do not contain palm oil. You've certainly got a returning customer. Huge well done.
2593 2018-11-09 19:51:39 Take out the bot and clout chasers and it's about 100-225 honest followers the numbers just a big lie anyways 
2594 2018-11-09 19:51:35 It’s just a shame that idiots are ok to glamourise kids playing on railway tracks and those businesses that are trying to educate the world about palm oil are being sidelined. It’s a funny old world
2595 2018-11-09 19:51:35 Hmm forget shehu sani don't try that if not u will see what will happen to u
2596 2018-11-09 19:51:35 I will scream it from the roof to increase awareness of destrusction that plant oil plantations have. @rangtanforest make a Christmas song.... you will make no.1 
2597 2018-11-09 19:51:35 I can smell doose a mile off
2598 2018-11-09 19:51:29 I go to olive garden to collect the oil while it is ripe. The waiters try to stop me with day old breadsticks but they don't expect my grease sliding physics now completely revamped in fallout 4.
2599 2018-11-09 19:51:25 Check out the banned ad from a shop called Iceland in the UK. Called rang tan... Iceland are banning palm oil from their products!
2600 2018-11-09 19:51:19 They should have at least taken the oil. I don't understand why you invade a country if you aren't even going to get anything of value out of it. That oil should technically still be ours.
2601 2018-11-09 19:51:09 Nothing feels better than laying that oil down on a tight scalp I swear to GAH
2602 2018-11-09 19:51:06 Fuck you palm oil
2603 2018-11-09 19:51:03 Went w the premium oil change instead of the other two standard options bc I’m rich now.
2604 2018-11-09 19:51:02 We are using Brent crude oil imported from the middle east. Raw oil itself is called crude & Brent is the international benchmark.
2605 2018-11-09 19:51:02 I tried used motor oil on one once. Yeah...
2606 2018-11-09 19:50:55 My natural hair is back to where it was, thanks to Black Jamican Castor Oil 
2607 2018-11-09 19:50:53 Ok. Let’s start the CNN spin machine. Oil it with plenty of bias and misleading interpretations. You go!!
2608 2018-11-09 19:50:46 I know oil is bad but I’m having a phenomenal time doing racecar shit and I’m stoked to add this to my resume.
2609 2018-11-09 19:50:45 Good.  The sooner less time, leading to very little time, is spent on oil and related industries, and the sooner more time is spent on renewable energy, the better.
2610 2018-11-09 19:50:43 Tracking over 50 US E&Ps who make up almost 5.5mm bpd of oil production have shown 3Q oil prod growth vs. 2Q of ~269k bpd.. yet EIA 914 data shows Aug growth vs July of 416k bpd.. something doesn’t add up.. are privates really growing that much faster then public companies? #OOTT
2611 2018-11-09 19:50:42 I love #Nutella but I pledge to not buy another jar until they remove the palm oil.
Retweet if you're with me.

2612 2018-11-09 19:50:36 Oil ta se segurando acima de 60,00....IFR14 abaixo de 20,00....fortemente sobrevendido...deve ter repique...PETR4 perdeu 25,70, mas se segurou acima de 25,00....talvez faça pullback nos 25,70...IFR14 em 48...longe de sobrevenda...cmig4 quicou nos 10,85 e antiga forte resistência
2613 2018-11-09 19:50:33 That sounds like a good hair care routine. Have you tried using argan oil on the ends? It's actually a really great way at trying to stop split ends from happening so you don't have to cut it as often.
2614 2018-11-09 19:50:24 It’s only political bc the politicians are in the pockets of name brand corporations who use palm oil
2615 2018-11-09 19:50:20 How does that work when the price of oil has gone up? And we’d have had 100% of that smaller amount instead of 0% of the original - so we’d still have been better off!
2616 2018-11-09 19:50:20 You mean heat pump? My parents’ electric heat pump in Maryland is completely unable to keep up with winter, it’s a joke and horribly expensive. In Alaska I use heating oil  furnace with a blower and air vents, and that works beautifully. Of course the house is super-insulated
2617 2018-11-09 19:50:19 Palm oil - just another well intentioned environmental disaster from #environmentalist(s)
2618 2018-11-09 19:50:17 I suspect all those big Corporate Giants using palm oil had a hand in this decision
2619 2018-11-09 19:50:10 It'll be cool, my dude. People come and go. But you still have a bunch of other followers who enjoy your content! Look on the bright side, my man 
2620 2018-11-09 19:50:08 Same dynamic, yes.  Remove phys collateral from a levered futures market & the price collapses.  This may be happening in oil.  

Open interest in Shanghai for Dec (next phys delivery mth) is 37m barrels.  September's was de minimus.  Could be interesting
2621 2018-11-09 19:50:02 Thank you @GateTenIndy for letting the Stebbins High School Marching Band have lunch in your great facility with your amazing staff! Hope to see you next year! #GateTenEvents is the place to be if you come to any event at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis!
2622 2018-11-09 19:49:54 @MaltesersUK please can you explain why you use palm oil in your products? Please can you confirm the places that you source this product are not previously precious environments essential for our sustainable futures? Please can you find less damaging alternatives? Yours in hope
2623 2018-11-09 19:49:53 just checked my oil and well..... shit 
2624 2018-11-09 19:49:48 “I need a thick bitch with that assgalore Seen the wizard of Oz I need Oil”@Hoodrich_Pablo
2625 2018-11-09 19:49:38 finally changing my oil. 10,000 miles later lol):
2626 2018-11-09 19:49:29 Indeed so.

And people RT like crazy...and continue to buy things with palm oil.
2627 2018-11-09 19:49:16 It was just R2 spraying oil or zapping 3PO. No different.
2628 2018-11-09 19:49:09 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
2629 2018-11-09 19:49:06 @SpectrumGeo Somali oil send gas!
2630 2018-11-09 19:48:58 I put up a wall when I’m getting an oil change...they could say “sir your engine is on fire  would you like for me to put it out?” and I’m like nah, I’m good...just an oil change please.
2631 2018-11-09 19:48:57 Salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and old bay seasoning. Cast iron pan, no oil, medium heat.
2632 2018-11-09 19:48:56 I think it’s been banned because it puts their other advertisers under threat. Too many brands who advertise have palm oil in their products. It’s a threat to ad revenue.
2633 2018-11-09 19:48:46 Mustard oil...aloo...long wedges as of parwal.....and parwal to be kept crisp... green and turmeric shall reflect only on potatoes.....hope I'm right...
2634 2018-11-09 19:48:36 “For 2018, the Company is rapidly approaching 2 million euros ($2.4 million US Dollars) in revenues..Representing nearly a 200 % increase over 2017. With Megola introducing CBD products and CBD infused olive oil into the U.S. and Canada, we are poised for substantial growth #MGON
2635 2018-11-09 19:48:30 mustard seed oil is amazing.
nature is amazing.
2636 2018-11-09 19:48:28 Oil down 10 days on a row!
2637 2018-11-09 19:48:26 Iraq was not as far as I know involved in any way to 9/11. Then they invaded it. And they didn't even take the oil.
2638 2018-11-09 19:48:26 I try to look at stuff I buy but practically everything has palm oil in. If Iceland can stop using it, don’t see why everyone else can’t!
2639 2018-11-09 19:48:08 It doesn't make sense that we've got wall-to-wall adverts for betting sites on TV but the Iceland ad highlighting the environmental damage of Palm oil is banned. We are too in hock to vested interests in this country.
2640 2018-11-09 19:48:06 I mean they've stilled removed palm oil from their stuff. Whatever gets the advert more exposure is what I care about, to educate people.
2641 2018-11-09 19:48:06 Paella, fish with garlic and olive oil, Crema Catalan 
2642 2018-11-09 19:48:03 Don't believe the responsibly sourced Palm oil industry. 
It's still terrible. Plus there is nothing nutritional about Palm oil.
2643 2018-11-09 19:47:36 Trains that carry oil aren't safe either and should be regulated.
2644 2018-11-09 19:47:31 Well I used to watch  mom cook for dad and when Sam used to be here well I cooked for him and I *says as put some oil ready to put the meat*
2645 2018-11-09 19:47:18 The new oil for Nigerian Youths is Intellectual Property rights and Innovation, which will make Youths to be more engaging than becoming dependants. 2019 will be unforgettable in our lives.
2646 2018-11-09 19:47:09 & I still have yet to get my oil changed
2647 2018-11-09 19:47:04 Why not build refineries closer to tar sands.  Less hazardous if refined oil or gas leaks from a pipe
2648 2018-11-09 19:47:01 Alif I love you and still have stew for you plus coconut oil shortbread and chocolate bread whenever u want it  missing you my moon slug 
2649 2018-11-09 19:46:58 I bet once #tslaq comes into being Musk will play the victim-card and his lemmings say he got destroyed by evil oil and car companies. Delusion above and beyond.
2650 2018-11-09 19:46:50 Oh okay it should heal pretty soon then && if it ever happens to get infected, use tea tree oil
2651 2018-11-09 19:46:48 Reminds me of how KIU danced City Oil 
2652 2018-11-09 19:46:39 @CardiffGarcia @svaneksmith why are oil prices dumping so hard when the economy is still booming? question for @theindicator maybe
2653 2018-11-09 19:46:38 kenny and scheer have only given lip service to kinder morgan having had thier eggs in the keystone basket for 14 years,now finally trump has kicked his Canadian buddies in the nuts to protect  the shale oil producers, note to cpc and upc,you reap what you sow.
2654 2018-11-09 19:46:31 With Keystone's completion in doubt &out of our control,  it's time for all stakeholders to come together & get Energy East built, gaining access to world price, adding value & creating jobs for Canadians, not Texans, reducing the import of conflict oil. #skpoli #cdnpoli #abpoli
2655 2018-11-09 19:46:22 we call it rapeseed oil in the uk
2656 2018-11-09 19:46:19 I miss kano Radio stations, I miss my regular yahuza or Murtala suya joint off Kabuga , I miss my tasty gurasa and yoghurt , I miss going to Rikadawa Madobi on Fridays, its a nice thing to be known by almost all in your village, thank you dad fr the reputation I love kano.
2657 2018-11-09 19:46:09 Interesting 

I have changed brand of oatcakes that I eat to one that doesn't use palm oil

Butter better

There are those other than us carnivores that are destroying the planet
2658 2018-11-09 19:46:07 The dude at this oil place change is so nice wow
2659 2018-11-09 19:46:02 well looks like ill never be getting a free oil change again
2660 2018-11-09 19:45:53 George please give a moment of @talkRADIO air time to Britain's best Supermarket on their bold new stance, raising awareness of man's mistreatment of the Orang utan to yield Palm oil.

I've never been prouder to be anyone's employee than I am to work for Iceland right now. - Ric
2661 2018-11-09 19:45:51 oil is firming up .. back in $CR
2662 2018-11-09 19:45:47 البلوك يرادفه عربياً الحظر، لمن لا يعرفون الانقليزية.
2663 2018-11-09 19:45:43 Hell yeah! It's the top selling Wild Thing Oil Poached Green Pea Watercress Pilaf. This baby's drowning in Ground Lamb Lubricant— (market price)! Only $420!
2664 2018-11-09 19:45:36 The solution isn’t raising awareness. Everyone knows what we are doing to the environment. if people want to use palm oil then they’ll use palm oil, no matter how moving the advert is.
2665 2018-11-09 19:45:30 NEVER!!!
2666 2018-11-09 19:45:29 Great commercial but as some have said if you care about the planet and animals why do you sell animal products!? Animal agriculture is doing the same thing on an even bigger scale as what palm oil is doing.
2667 2018-11-09 19:45:21 Palm oil
2668 2018-11-09 19:45:20 Been scanning labels of everything I buy for lack of palm oil for years! I look like a weirdo, but it's worth it..
2669 2018-11-09 19:45:10 Is it <drum roll> PEAK OIL?
2670 2018-11-09 19:45:00 it’s a good step but probably just a bump in the road, lots of money in oil and ~somehow~ it makes its way into politicians’ hands

one day they’ll learn that renewable, sustainable energy is cheaper and a better investment, hopefully
2671 2018-11-09 19:44:56 I'm the ocean and you're an oil slick
now I am choking on your thought pollution
2672 2018-11-09 19:44:50 I’ll vote for an #independent Scotland in any future vote! Everyone else can fuck right off! But buy whisky, lamb & oil and shortbread, irn bro and come visit. You’re all welcome #snp
2673 2018-11-09 19:44:44 Maybe someone should tell _you_ that this individual was able to acquire his gun legally because our gun control is about as effective as a napkin cleaning up an oil spill.
2674 2018-11-09 19:44:34 The judge dug deep into oil prices, lifecycle analysis, and more. Impressive. Observed we're no longer in the zone of $100+/bbl oil prices from the SEIS "base case", and in the zone where KXL could mean difference between oil sands getting to market or not.
2675 2018-11-09 19:44:23 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
2676 2018-11-09 19:44:23 ที่รีๆไปเนี้ยจะเอามาใช้แต่งหน้างานแต่งเพื่อนหรอแก @Tsuna_oil
2677 2018-11-09 19:44:05 Think it has! I must confess it has made me check ingredients but palm oil is in everything!!!
2678 2018-11-09 19:44:03 If they knew.. the reasons for war.. secret gold bunkers.. oil.. regime change.. alien archaic tech etc..

Maybe they wouldn't fight..

We always need an army in case the SHTF.. but..
2679 2018-11-09 19:43:53 @saynotopalmoil hi, is there a place on social media to share products that don’t contain palm oil? Shopping takes such a long time when avoiding that it would be great to have tips on alternatives. Eg. Some of Tesco Finest dark chocolate is palm oil free and delicious.
2680 2018-11-09 19:43:50 No cause for alarm. Even if it gets to 50 dollars we have enough buffer in our excess crude account given that oil price has been above 65 dollars for many months now.
2681 2018-11-09 19:43:28 Have no idea why this was banned. Heard about this morning on R4 too. What is wrong with people who don’t want us to hear the truth. Well done Iceland for raising everyone’s awareness of palm oil. Heroes
2682 2018-11-09 19:43:26 Iceland: Hey fam we're not using palm oil because it kills orangutans 
Fucking knob jockeys: BLOODY PC GONE MAD!! WHY DO YOU HAVE TO TURN IT POLITICAL? #NOTMYCHRISTMASAD GET IT BANNED
And they call us easily offended snowflakes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2683 2018-11-09 19:43:20 Out here getting my oil changed and I left my goddamn playboy bunny juul sitting on the seat as they were getting in my car to take it. Might I add I don’t have enough money to pay for it cuz 2018 Toyota Camrys have a special oil apparently. Not ready for adulthood.
2684 2018-11-09 19:43:10 Standard Oil inks deal with Union Pacific to carry its oil as long as it refuses to carry any independent producers.
2685 2018-11-09 19:43:02 @WBrettWilson Brett, how long before our political leaders, who are colluding with environmental organizations to economically destroy Alberta by choking off access to our crude oil, finish the job? Decades? Years? Can we do ANYTHING? I hear "This is bad." I hear no plan. Thanks.
2686 2018-11-09 19:43:02 Before oil Norway was in the bottom 3 for poverty in all of Europe!

Scotland has MORE OIL than Norway

Now Norway is the wealthiest in Europe.

...Norway isn't in an unequal union!
2687 2018-11-09 19:43:01 My dad, a WWII vet, died in '68, when I was in 4th grade. Researching family history,  I found that I could order up his medals from his navy service. VERY cool! He enlisted at 17, was a coxswain on an oil tanker in the Pacific Fleet, ran an LST. (had nightmares till he died)
2688 2018-11-09 19:42:56 No kidding. Germany pays Russia billions of dollars for their oil. And we spend billions of dollars protecting Germany, from Russia. Give me a break. 

Just common sense to exit NATO, but nobody even mentioned that, until Trump came along.
2689 2018-11-09 19:42:45 Remind me not to wait so long on an oil change again. Damn. #dirtyoil #dirtyfilters
2690 2018-11-09 19:42:40 Open up production = cheap oil = people looking the other way
2691 2018-11-09 19:42:35 No he did not! It keeps happening - for the same reasons. 
UK has NEVER gone to war to stop future wars.
Religion/Empire/Ethnic Riches/Slaves/Opium/Oil are all the reasons the UK has gone to war xcept WW2!
No point in getting carried away with Imperilaist TV delivered clap-trap.
2692 2018-11-09 19:42:35 I think it's amazing to me that between the Mexican gp and Brazilian gp they only just noticed the oil tank crack
2693 2018-11-09 19:42:28 The brake oil in my own dey leak. Shey you go manage am
2694 2018-11-09 19:42:28 SOOOOO...

What is is CBD oil thing, anyone tested it?

How is it going for you?

Do it build muscle?  LOL.
2695 2018-11-09 19:42:28 XLE continues to act like it’ll be +3% the next day oil is green.
2696 2018-11-09 19:42:27 He banned all product containing palm oil
 So why wasn't that seen as political? Those wankers that banned the would probably say that was his personal choice, if  so, it's his personal to show an ad expressing his feeling about the destruction caused by palm oil
2697 2018-11-09 19:42:24 It’s not going to matter... @JustinTrudeau has an agenda that doesn’t include oil and gas development.
2698 2018-11-09 19:42:14 I believe so... I think they’ve stopped selling anything with palm oil in store too
2699 2018-11-09 19:42:03 Sucks for people who still rely on oil.
2700 2018-11-09 19:41:51 @PowerLunch Sorry @TheDomino but where were you in 2014?? Cheap #oil was good for NO ONE! It did not help restaurants, stores, anyone. Actually it HURT more than it helped. GE oil business, truckers, railroads, frackers, etc etc.

Learn from the past.
@TradersCom @EnergyPhilFlynn
2701 2018-11-09 19:41:51 Lol do you want to relate? 
2702 2018-11-09 19:41:35 Sharjeel  bhai ka oil tha doctor sahab
2703 2018-11-09 19:41:33 Because its just one factor. Youre not factoring for inflation, the Cali Gas tax or the price of crude oil (mind you this was 2000, which was before 9/11 AND the war in Iraq both of which affected the oil price). You cang over simplify data just to prove an argument
2704 2018-11-09 19:41:30 I have not heard oil referred to as black gold and Texas tea in the same sentence since watching an old episode of The Beverly Hillbillies!
2705 2018-11-09 19:41:29 Should have referenced that more favorable oil and gas climate would increase tax revenue and enable Canada to send more $ outside of our borders for UN initiatives.
2706 2018-11-09 19:41:20 Where are yall changing your oil?
2707 2018-11-09 19:41:20 Price of oil dropped again today,now around 16% in the 
last month.
What have TESCO dropped their forecourt prices by?

A LOUSY ONE PENCE.       PATHETIC. 

Where’s the protest brigade?

IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE?
2708 2018-11-09 19:41:05 What a mess. House of Saud kept in power by western hating Wahabis (sp?) and sitting on top of cheaply extracted oil allowing them to control world markets. A ready made mega-rich radical Islamic state if the dictators are tossed and global commerce shredded. Y/N ?
2709 2018-11-09 19:41:01 On a day when oil gets down to $69.23.16 gas jumps to 75.00
2710 2018-11-09 19:41:01 You just don’t until your dad drives your car and is like “HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR OIL?” And you’re all like “changed the wha”
2711 2018-11-09 19:41:00 Last night..salami, provolone,rw vin and olive oil on a piece of ripped Italian bread ... if I had the fresh mozz, it would have been a different sandwhich possibly
2712 2018-11-09 19:41:00 How dumb are you? The pipeline is to help CANADA export that oil elsewhere. It's not our oil and will have no effect on gas prices here. It will only cause major environmental damage in it path.
2713 2018-11-09 19:40:55 this hemp oil I just got smells like wheatgrass :(
2714 2018-11-09 19:40:48 @IcelandFoods support you 100% over palm oil add and will support you with my custom in your decision to remove palm oil from your products. Your add should not be banned.
2715 2018-11-09 19:40:42 Hey at you can recycle vegetable oil and it feels; baby!
2716 2018-11-09 19:40:39 About 85 percent of the world’s soybean crop is processed into meal and vegetable oil, and virtually all of that meal is used in animal feed.
2717 2018-11-09 19:40:38 Sure #Armenia will become one like these gigants. Though we havent ports, oil or gas sources.
2718 2018-11-09 19:40:27 ジルバさんの手品スゲーよなー！
2719 2018-11-09 19:40:22 @CadburyUK Is a huge supporter of palm oil, it is time we stop buying there product it is the only way.
2720 2018-11-09 19:40:15 So this morning i gave a birthday present to my colleague worth RM216 but i split the bill with my boss so its RM108/person. And tonight all of a sudden a customer called and bought my kids oil set worth RM150 :") subhanallah
2721 2018-11-09 19:40:13 Idk what was funnier about hanging out with my dad today, Him pulling a jalapeño out of his pocket before eating his burger or the hood of my car falling on his head while he was checking my oil 
2722 2018-11-09 19:40:10 Especially with the truffle oil. My mouth is watering just thinking of it.
2723 2018-11-09 19:40:07 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
2724 2018-11-09 19:40:04 @MorattiJ I’d rather have Canada help with oil than those other fuckfaces that can’t keep their word for a half a second
2725 2018-11-09 19:40:02 I like chai spice made by stash. It has cinnamon, ginger root, allspice  clove bud oil.
2726 2018-11-09 19:40:00 Its a cold one!! wanna warm up? we know what you need -- warming lube and massage oil!
 Swing by and pick some up while supplies last
2727 2018-11-09 19:39:58 Funds selling crude oil show little interest in selling agricultural markets. So far.
2728 2018-11-09 19:39:25 Now you can ACTUALLY make snake oil
2729 2018-11-09 19:39:14 It’s terrible, isn’t it? I never leave home without lavender or peppermint essential oils to breathe in, in case of emergency. 
What special oil do you use?
2730 2018-11-09 19:39:14 Oh I spilt carbolic oil all over my carpet , how well I’ll hoover it up tommorow
2731 2018-11-09 19:39:09 Not a big fan of Greenpeace but this cartoon is not political. Loss of animal/human life & deforestation in pursuit of palm oil are well known. It does have a positive message at the end. Good luck @IcelandFoods in your pursuit of eliminating this from your products.
2732 2018-11-09 19:39:06 Hahahaha Hahahaha omg took my car to get an oil change, Hyundai says I may need a new engine. I’m in Indiana for now. Dunno when I’m gonna be back in Illinois 
2733 2018-11-09 19:39:05 Guess I'm doing all my shopping at #Iceland this year. Morals have no price. Count me in in saying no to palm oil #IcelandAdvert
2734 2018-11-09 19:39:04 Endangered species impacts" by oil spills on land? Ha! How many golden eagles and other #endangeredspecies have been blended by those wind-farms with leftist government consent? The leftist hypocricy stinks..
2735 2018-11-09 19:39:03 @Clearcast Your decision on the Iceland palm oil add is wrong. The content of the add is factually correct, nothing to do with politics. Wake up and smell the forest fires!!
2736 2018-11-09 19:39:03 Me i can't relate
2737 2018-11-09 19:38:51 When does the drop in crude oil change from a consumer stimulus to a headwind for energy profitability?
2738 2018-11-09 19:38:40 im sure the shale oil lobby helped trumpies retain the senate and key red states,so its not surprising a red state judge shuts down  Canadian export capacity in keystone. we need our own pipline,fuck trump.
2739 2018-11-09 19:38:31 I need to go get the oil changed in my truck today and price out new tires. But like, I really don't want to hahahha

2741 2018-11-09 19:38:25 Since you mentioned Iran, which country backed the coup of 1953 against the democratically elected government of Mosaddegh, who wanted to nationalize Iranian oil, to replace him with the brutal dictatorship of Reza Pahlavi (the Shah)? The US did.
2742 2018-11-09 19:38:23 Leave this Dimwit that has never gone as far as Benue jisting us that the North is divided. Read all their cimments above, seems they all attended same school smwhere down there.

2744 2018-11-09 19:38:21 Dear Ontario & Quebec Dairy Corporations......
You stop buying foreign oil and the west will stop buying Foreign Dairy products. 
Please open your eyes, the West already give Ont & Que billions in Equalization via Ottawa. 
No more charity for Canada’s 2  largest provinces!
2745 2018-11-09 19:38:18 Yep, a blow to Trump admin deregulation and a blow to corporate American the the rich elite who won't see huge profits for right now, but eventually the money, and oil, will flow and most Americans will see no benefit.

2750 2018-11-09 19:38:05 Federal government has a vision for our oil industry! It’s called “mothballed”
2751 2018-11-09 19:38:00 It's indicating to people to have a palm oil free Christmas
2752 2018-11-09 19:37:59 The issue isn’t why the advert didn’t get broadcast clearance, or the technicalities of its rejection. Nor is it whether the advert qualifies as Chrismassy enough. Nor is it about getting free advertising or a publicity stunt. It’s about deforestation for palm oil #IcelandAdvert
2753 2018-11-09 19:37:53 Endangered species impacts" by oil spills on land? Ha! How many golden eagles and other #endangeredspecies have been blended by those wind-farms with leftist government consent? The leftist hypocricy stinks..
2754 2018-11-09 19:37:51 Where is the north? Does that include Benue, Plateau, Taraba, southern Kaduna?You suddenly remember and talk about the north after using Fulani herdsmen to mercilessly kill and maim the people of these areas? And you talk about shops and ID cards even though it’s all lies.
2755 2018-11-09 19:37:44 They have you on both Xanax and lorazepam? The mints helped me before and sometimes work over my lorazepam for the stomach thing and the bracelet the cbd oil will help too
2756 2018-11-09 19:37:39 Brand new battery, fresh oil change, next new feet!! Damnit mitts.  but if I don’t care for you no one else will.

2758 2018-11-09 19:37:34 But as the camera drew nearer, the perspective became clearer -- the oil well wasn't behind the man (who was no hero), it was through him.
2759 2018-11-09 19:37:33 Females: h-

car technicians: Looks like you need an oil change and a new door panel
2760 2018-11-09 19:37:28 annndddd I still have to get an oil change.
2761 2018-11-09 19:37:26 From my NotAFanFiction collection: From half a mile away, it looked like the end of a movie, the hero sitting in the desert watching the sun disappearing over the horizon, an oil well behind him.
2762 2018-11-09 19:37:20 Looks

2764 2018-11-09 19:37:18 That Iceland ad is, of course, very powerful and moving and I applaud them for their efforts. But it's only Iceland's own-brand products which they're removing palm oil from. They still sell plenty of other brands' items which contain it. So if they're really *that* bothered…
2765 2018-11-09 19:37:07 If you don’t pay for oil changes, gas to fill up, car problems that can cost thousands of dollars to fix, your lights, a STICKER that cost a hundred dollars, tires, etc then STFU. $60 ain’t shit but it’s the principle of the thing.
2766 2018-11-09 19:37:00 K... so don’t ever turn my music down and I’ll never need an oil change is what I just read. Thx for that tea.
2767 2018-11-09 19:36:54 big oil generated a convenient market crash ahead of the midterms
2768 2018-11-09 19:36:53 #KeystoneXL  and #TMX court decisions must trigger massive immediate oil by rail and truck to sustain #Alberta oil economy and to reverse the disastrous drop in Western crude price! Meanwhile the Indigenous legal blocks will need to be addressed asap politically and legislatively
2769 2018-11-09 19:36:48 Word, the price of oil pre 9/11 and Iraq war was only affected by the raise in MW, no other factors
2770 2018-11-09 19:36:44 Stocks and macro: Finally seeing headline chatter about weakening global Economy. SP500 wipes out post election gain. 10 days lower for oil is an extreme?
2771 2018-11-09 19:36:35 Oil is so much quicker to paint with
2772 2018-11-09 19:36:20 You're being bribed by the palm oil corporations, just admit it.
2773 2018-11-09 19:36:16 Iran boasted that they had cells here and in the EU and if they were attacked they would let them loose. When Chavez was alive he gave terrorists cover in the state run oil company. With border protection stretched thin and terror groups in MN and Detroit area we are an inch away

2776 2018-11-09 19:35:52 I personally use some kind of oil like castor oil, warm water, & washcloth to take off my makeup. It doesn’t sting like some makeup wipes do and I feel the makeup comes off a lot easier. And it’s better for your skin! Less chemicals and less wasteful
2777 2018-11-09 19:35:50 No. No . No. No.
2778 2018-11-09 19:35:47 oil is going to ZERO! 
2779 2018-11-09 19:35:35 @andrewbolwell welcome mr Andrew
2780 2018-11-09 19:35:26 yeah i hear ya. i had shorts on yesterday then get scared to hold and they would have paid great instead of bought oil and now tech and both crushed me. it seems i'm a day early or late every time lately and it hurts.
2781 2018-11-09 19:35:24 United States Submarines with nukes say stay off the North Pole that oil needs to stay yet the keystone pipeline would eventually drain that oil right down the middle of the United States with Russia in on it look like someone is selling out the country
2782 2018-11-09 19:35:20 I was very wrong about Oil..... seems a little fishy to me though

Mi Kee smelt his past as he remembered the troops herding the villagers together; pouring oil over them before throwing the burning brands but that was Justice – they hadn’t paid their taxes – they knew the punishment.
2784 2018-11-09 19:35:16 Getting a free oil change later so that’s a plus
2785 2018-11-09 19:35:05 I’m at Burger King with my nephews and I’m pretty sure this kid is having an allergic reaction bc his grandparents didn’t know they cook their food in peanut oil 
2786 2018-11-09 19:35:01 Truly heart breaking to watch this ad. I did hear that palm oil can produce 4.5x more oil per km2 than other oils. So soya oil would require much more deforestation for example. IMO I’d rather no oil to protect primary rainforest and it fauna and flora (not the butter/oil)
2787 2018-11-09 19:34:57 @Clearcast deemed it too political.. this means that the government are making ££££££s from the production of palm oil and they can't jeopardise that money.. at the expense of the planet and all its beautiful fantastic creature. Please sign the petition for it to be released!
2788 2018-11-09 19:34:57 Remember when the Unionist lot said oil wouldn't go above $75.00 pb again?

It changes prices constantly. It'll never always be low...
2789 2018-11-09 19:34:51 I love what I do, but if I wasn’t doing this I would be working in the oil field. I’ll never be the type to work an office job, I like getting my hands dirty and getting shit done

2794 2018-11-09 19:34:37 Them mfs lucky I can't find $10gs of oil anywhere near me legally
2795 2018-11-09 19:34:31 Strangely, what one nation does affects the world, particularly when it is a super power. And I’d just bet you love it when our country sticks it’s nose up the asses of particularly countries with oil.  Not even simply voicing opinions but actually invading.
2796 2018-11-09 19:34:20 Olive oil
2797 2018-11-09 19:34:12 You don't collect royalties on oil when is not sold, as would be the case if raising royalties to a level you speak of.
2798 2018-11-09 19:34:11 Why don't you ask the companies out east that buy that oil, I have no idea.  I think it's called "capitalism"? #KeystoneXL

2801 2018-11-09 19:33:52 YES! Love my MCT oil. It makes such a big difference on my energy sustainment throughout the day.
2802 2018-11-09 19:33:46 Just out of interest are your products free from palm oil?
2803 2018-11-09 19:33:45 Oil price rises above $70.10 per barrel
2804 2018-11-09 19:33:45 Question?  We just assumed Bush willing to cheat his way into the presidency.  And he was even worse than we thought.  Unnecessary death and destruction throughout Middle East (in service of oil pals and Israelis).  Bush is vile - likely worse than Trump will ever be.
2805 2018-11-09 19:33:41 Well its official I’m finally out of oil.
2806 2018-11-09 19:33:32 I chuckle every time Alex Jones says his fish oil softgels are "Solid...liquid...consciousness."  Every time.
2807 2018-11-09 19:33:24 Pro tip they work if you use coconut oil first lol
2808 2018-11-09 19:33:23 Zinke is our enemy. His values are atrocious and a slap in the face to anyone who appreciates our incredible natural parks and environment. He’s sold out to oil. Let’s oust him!
2809 2018-11-09 19:33:15 Bless my nail lady. I went in feeling like shit & she noticed so she gave me some oil to rub under my nose and put a nose strip on me. I can breathe & smell again... she’s a blessing. Claiming her as my new grandma.

2814 2018-11-09 19:32:58 A major reason I loved getting my oil changed is because they vacuum my car too
2815 2018-11-09 19:32:54 I was just about to ask about international economic conditions that may have coincided temporally with democracy... I assume you are not serious that democracy raised oil prices (but if you are, what's the story? why would/ did democracy raise oil prices?).
2816 2018-11-09 19:32:53 I use creams of nature spray leave in, the Aegean oil eco styler and just some oils to break the case once it’s fully dry 

My hair hair tends to flake reallyyyy fast so I keep it minimal
2817 2018-11-09 19:32:51 Cooking oil theyo is similar to IGMH Hospital!
2818 2018-11-09 19:32:46 The oil prices would still be high because of greedy oil CEOs and we would have a sick environment.
2819 2018-11-09 19:32:46 Does this mean you will ban any foods in your store that use palm oil ?

2825 2018-11-09 19:32:15 It’s a wonderfully powerful advert. A brilliant eye opening message to everyone who is unaware of the effects of palm oil, especially children. It’s their future that needs safeguarding.
2826 2018-11-09 19:32:10 My cousin was carrying some CBD oil and was pulled over in Lancaster PA. All most went to jail of it. He wasn't carry just a bottle though so maybe that was the problem.
2827 2018-11-09 19:32:09 Need to hurry up and start this oil field job so I can be there dec 1st in midland

2829 2018-11-09 19:31:59 Why did I put that cursed coconut oil on my hair 
2830 2018-11-09 19:31:59 If you add water to oil and they dont mix together, does this mean that:
2831 2018-11-09 19:31:44 Yea yee oil
2832 2018-11-09 19:31:30 
Oil well
2833 2018-11-09 19:31:27 “Rapeseed” oil is less frightening
2834 2018-11-09 19:31:27 It could be a big blow I meant to say. The longer it gets delayed the lower the prospects of many oil sands projects

2836 2018-11-09 19:31:16 We keep saying this. We are very poor. We were misinformed from primary school. The narrative has been that everyone in Nigeria should be very rich from our crude oil. We don't get it. We are poor but potentially rich.
2837 2018-11-09 19:31:07 Oil bloc
2838 2018-11-09 19:31:05 F*** I’m gonna smell like oil for the rest of the day
2839 2018-11-09 19:31:05 They changed it from “snake oil” to “fish oil” and we bought back in. That’s on us.
2840 2018-11-09 19:31:03 Is a low or high oil price a good thing? High prices means less consumption, but also burning dirtier fuel.
2841 2018-11-09 19:31:00 Wllh ina nan kaman an shaqe ni
2842 2018-11-09 19:30:53 A disgrace just watched you beautiful advert we on twitter should ban everything that contains Palm Oil!!!
2843 2018-11-09 19:30:39 iceland’s ad being banned for uk broadcast bc it talks abt deforestation and the damaging effects of palm oil?? good to know the main media controllers of our country are actively against even small moves towards helping the planet 
2844 2018-11-09 19:30:37 One of the most enduring legacies of Oil Boom era is the belief that Nigeria has an unlimited amount of money;

It will take a bit to shake it off.
2845 2018-11-09 19:30:34 what is so funny?
2846 2018-11-09 19:30:28 I know deforestation is a thing the palm oil thing was new to me but it is beautifully done.
2847 2018-11-09 19:30:27 They'll drown u in that oil ooo
2848 2018-11-09 19:30:23 I urge you all to research the impact palm oil has on the environment and the homes of orangutans, tigers, elephants. Read here >
#NoPalmOilChristmas
2849 2018-11-09 19:30:19 And remember it’s big oil traders that do this, not really national governments.
2850 2018-11-09 19:30:17 Defo gonna try and stop buying things that contain palm oil after watching that, didn’t even realise that’s what it did  those poor orangutans!!  #IcelandAdvert #NoPalmOilChristmas
2851 2018-11-09 19:30:14 There used to be a couple of Ola stations near Slane actually. Back in the early 80's or during one of the oil crises the state set up the company. So long ago there doesn't seem to be anything on d'internet about it #petrolstationanorak
2852 2018-11-09 19:29:59 The palm oil crisis is hardly political no matter who the message is from. @IcelandFoods Had a fantastic way of delivering that message to audiences of all ages and it's banned...  #IcelandAdvert
2853 2018-11-09 19:29:56 I makem mi self but my friend gave me the one I ate yesterday, they're not hard to make at all. I'd suggest using coconut oil instead of butter
2854 2018-11-09 19:29:50 ~castor oil! 

apply it straight to the scalp leave it in overnight, the oil will make your hair grow faster, healthier, and thicker. In the morning make sure to wash it out very good because it have a very thick texture !
2855 2018-11-09 19:29:49 I could tell you stories of men who declined college and made a great living in the West Texas oil fields. I had a team that included college grads and men that learned the business from the ground up. To me it was America at its best
2856 2018-11-09 19:29:46 Why do Ont & Que get oil from Saudi Sheiks who murdered a Journalist, kicked out our Ambassador, pulled all investment in  & recalled thousands of students. Why reward Saudi’s by selling them weapons for use on their people. Ont & Que still love Saudi Oil
But no Pipeline Oil.
2857 2018-11-09 19:29:46 But oil next levels it, just so much easier to take and a much nicer high
2858 2018-11-09 19:29:40 And I am from the left and it annoys me about my own side
2859 2018-11-09 19:29:34 Agree with you.
2860 2018-11-09 19:29:34 I also see my tax dollars being spent while Exxon gets a write off when they drill and find no oil, and my tax dollars pay for farmers who didn’t get enough return on their crops and I don’t complain because it is for the country
2861 2018-11-09 19:29:32 *goes to get an oil change* ends up needing a new battery.. not a fan
2862 2018-11-09 19:29:30 Don’t normally shop @IcelandFoods  but what a fab advert, albeit banned. I’d like to know what my usual supermarkets @sainsburys  and @Tesco are doing about their corporate position on palm oil. Please advise?
2863 2018-11-09 19:29:27 Beef is a catch-22.  Although the ratio is high, the absolute amount of O6 in beef is extremely low.  As long as you consume fish and / or fish oil in addition to beef, you should be fine.
2864 2018-11-09 19:29:24 Whatever it takes.  This Obama appointed activist Judge is not our friend.  Trump may not be good for oil prices, but he is good for regulatory procedures.
2865 2018-11-09 19:29:12 Yes, very artificial so replace the core of journalism: Opinion, by a robot without opinion.

The next thing will it be to have olive oil without olive? Or without oil? 
Maybe cars without fuel. But with a driver. 
No computer driven cars, thank you!
2866 2018-11-09 19:29:12 Let's get that Oil! By the way! There's more wildlife now than there has been in the last 100 years! Check out the Real Bison Problem!
2867 2018-11-09 19:29:10 In the Test Valley at Stockbridge prospectors for oil and gas are a threat to this wonderful river
2868 2018-11-09 19:28:57 Does anyone know where I can order Egusi and Red Palm Oil? It can be an online store that delivers

2870 2018-11-09 19:28:43 They are able to free hunt in the arctic and they also provide the first line of defence for Canada in case of an invasion in the arctic. Personally I believe trump will have us in WW3 with China before we find an alternative to oil. We are fucked at both ends.
2871 2018-11-09 19:28:32 I love it. What will happen if we don't have palm oil? Will we all starve? Will the world come to an end? No. Thought not.
Some very rich people may have to find another way to make money, though.
2872 2018-11-09 19:28:30 I only shared this earlier this week.

Coal is the 2nd highest power source in USA and highest in Germany

Which freaking climate change treaty? That's not the reason at all

Its all fed govt's fault. They ignored other resources once oil was discovered to the detriment of others
2873 2018-11-09 19:28:11 Lmaooo don’t use a brush and try and take it off in the bath cos my baby’s hair came off with it  use oil !
2874 2018-11-09 19:28:07 I wanna get a tattoo of the house from the movie Monster House on my back
2875 2018-11-09 19:28:07 Time for a bounce in oil.  Got some 65 strike calls for Feb 19.
2876 2018-11-09 19:28:00 We are a relatively modest user of palm oil, nevertheless, we do substitute palm oil with alternatives where appropriate.
Best wishes, Carolyn from the Aptaclub team.
2877 2018-11-09 19:28:00  .. only because my car uses synthetic oil
2878 2018-11-09 19:27:58 Lol as if her DMS dont hv ppl waiting to do more
2879 2018-11-09 19:27:58 Hey baby, wanna come over and help me change my oil?
2880 2018-11-09 19:27:57 I’m so embarrassed. rn. fine as guy. at the oil change place. And I didn’t have time to take the trash out my car.....
2881 2018-11-09 19:27:55 Actually Opec didnt do it. When Canadian oil is traded at 1/4 of world price to just the US. You do know that it isnt only Alberta that has oil. Opec had nothing to do with it. It was both Notley and Trudeau. Too bad you cant stay informed.
2882 2018-11-09 19:27:51 Oil price continues to rise.
2883 2018-11-09 19:27:45 two doffent oils. flax seeed oil. around lunch time and the coconut oil in the morning.
2884 2018-11-09 19:27:44 Democrats are using minority groups to pass their fracking through.

They have the perfect game plan because if you go against a gay man for his fracking record,they will call you anti-gay.  

It is the perfect sneaky plan to get fracking & oil strong and the earth sick and weak.
2885 2018-11-09 19:27:33 Democracy raised oil prices, clearly.
2886 2018-11-09 19:27:28 We recognise that the destruction of the world's rainforests from expanding and unsustainable palm oil production is a concern. Sustainable palm oil cultivation practices must be promoted to preserve ecosystems and bring sustainable benefits to local communities.
2887 2018-11-09 19:27:27 taking my oil separately with apple cider vinegar.
2888 2018-11-09 19:27:26 coconut oil is still much superior to seed oils
2889 2018-11-09 19:27:26 They sell branded stuff with palm oil in apparently, if they take it off the shelves then it may mean something
2890 2018-11-09 19:27:24 I tried my sister's bio oil this mid term break. Tk pernah skip every nightt sebab im broke af nk beli skincare sendiri, alah student kn. But like i baru cuba seminggu tau but my burn face n uneven skin tone lenyap in a week!! My pimple scars pun dan samar2 n skin nmpak moist je

2892 2018-11-09 19:27:24 WILL CBD OIL MAKE ME LESS ATTRACTED TO THE GREEN M&M!?
2893 2018-11-09 19:27:20 Lol if I hear, even another plate you can't add
2894 2018-11-09 19:27:19 Lovely! Will do. Enjoy the last few months of Salah before he is sold to satisfy American shareholders and fund a baseball team and also the fact FSG are now not selling up so that dirty Oil money still evades you! Adios 
2895 2018-11-09 19:27:15 I got some oil and acid resistant Colorado shoes for R250. Thrifting is best for this economy.
2896 2018-11-09 19:27:13 What is that? Oil? Or flex seal
2897 2018-11-09 19:27:06 @cvpayne I love cheap gas but I don't want oil to get so cheap that it leads to layoffs here.  Oil companies have to find that right balance of production whether to keep at current pace or slow it down a little.
2898 2018-11-09 19:27:00 Hi Daniel. We are a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and already source 100% of palm oil from suppliers who are RSPO members. The RSPO aims to develop and implement global environmental and social standards for sustainable palm oil production.
2899 2018-11-09 19:26:55 @COSMermaid After 10 years, I decided to try sardines again. Ripped open a bag of smoked sardines, drained the oil, mashed the fish & put it on a saltine...omg delicious! Definitely not going to wait another 10 years before having more!
2900 2018-11-09 19:26:53 I am very thrown off by you being rational, Chodeface
2901 2018-11-09 19:26:43 Got a head and inject it and spice it up tonight . Then hang it on something or put on a rack so water will come out . Lotta water in that oil could start a fire

2903 2018-11-09 19:26:38 Why compare oil with class
2904 2018-11-09 19:26:33 Tysm i am already on xanax and lorazepam and i do things to distract myself but it’s honestly happening all the time i might have to try cbd oil and a seasick bracelet ty
2905 2018-11-09 19:26:29 so in the morning it’s like 800 calls total with the oil and protein. oh yes. protein from the shake.
2906 2018-11-09 19:26:20 And Nee’oil ticked Hannibal off big time! Woo hoo. Right, back to RL & @BBCInOurTime podcast on The Picts #thearchers
2907 2018-11-09 19:26:20 oil. However, the Illuminati uses Tesla free energy for its Mars cities and undersea cities and other planets’ cities, because it is absolutely free of cost. All the nephilim and chimera species on other planets use free energy. The electromagnetic domes keep out the ocean water
2908 2018-11-09 19:26:20 If you watch that, and think anyone is doing a bad thing by promoting this message, or pledging to remove Palm Oil from their products, because 'politics'... I sincerely believe you may need to try and find your soul. It's lost.
2909 2018-11-09 19:26:17 It’s amazing the amount of stuff that palm oil is in.
2910 2018-11-09 19:26:14 Cuz u r
2911 2018-11-09 19:26:11 What do you mean by mental health. For some that means compassion towards others. Or maybe it means being alone. For me, it is the realization that oil companies must be destroyed.
2912 2018-11-09 19:26:06 i can understand the iceland advert ban because of advertisement legislation but i still think the video should be seen and shared.. people clearly need to be shocked into realising the impact of palm oil
2913 2018-11-09 19:26:03 @AnthonyRothman my wife has purchased what I can only assume to be thousands of dollars of oil from that place. Also OPA next door has every bourbon imaginable.
2914 2018-11-09 19:26:02 Allah sarki...
2915 2018-11-09 19:26:01 I am disgusted that this has been banned who do these people think they are probably the wealthy company owners who use palm oil if they can ban this advert then we should ban their products that contain Palm Oil let us all ban anything which contains Palm Oil come on Twitter RT
2916 2018-11-09 19:25:58 I love when my clients come with coconut oil in their hair. And I’m allergic to coconut . Cool Susan, my hands will just burn off.
2917 2018-11-09 19:25:57 Wasn’t she a Hooters girl hot oil wrestling with the male hosts of Fox & Friends years ago? 

Fox News. Where intellectualism goes to die.
2918 2018-11-09 19:25:54 I'm not an Iceland shopper but might be now I've learnt they've banned Palm oil from their shops, from reading that
2919 2018-11-09 19:25:47 Martha Stewart deleted her “oil” tweet 
2920 2018-11-09 19:25:45 Already talk in trade union circles of construction workers being housed in a ship off shore which has been standard practice with the construction and dismantling of off shore oil rigs. Specialised workers would obviously be brought in on a job and finish basis.
2921 2018-11-09 19:25:43 Waiting for my oil change ...
2922 2018-11-09 19:25:42 drill my ass like the united states military looking for oil in arabic countries
2923 2018-11-09 19:25:41 same reason oil companies don't like environmental science. They figured it out long ago and know they're on the wrong side.
2924 2018-11-09 19:25:33 steal trillions and trillions of dollars using their earth-polluting health-hazard petroleum oil industry fraud, so they confiscated that technology, and use it only in their Illuminati space fleets and Illuminati cities on other planets. There is no electricity used for the

2926 2018-11-09 19:25:32 Hi James, it does make shopping harder but chocolate (not Cadbury obvs) is quite an easy one whilst biscuits are a nightmare to find without palm oil. Bahlsen and Lotus don’t have palm oil. Also, Sun Pat peanut butter doesn’t!!!
2927 2018-11-09 19:25:22 Crude is well off the lows! (feeble attempt to be an oil optimist).
2928 2018-11-09 19:25:18 It's oil both times what did it, when you think about it
2929 2018-11-09 19:25:17 Thank you !!!!  Im honored to help others and hopefully let people know that even late stage 4 diagnosis is NOT the end ...  Ive found that with a gram of organic cannabis oil per day for over 90 days, the cancer dies

2932 2018-11-09 19:25:06 Our strategy for the future should be to play an intricate role in Climate Change by getting our oil to tidewater, using the billions and billions of dollars generated from that to have better infrastructure, healthcare and education. Seems reasonable to me.
2933 2018-11-09 19:24:56 Oil down, dollar up, and market head south compliments of @realDonaldTrump. This is the market that the Republicans will bring you with their trade war in tow. Serves the fools right who voted for @republicans. Get ready for a correction next week.
2934 2018-11-09 19:24:55 lol I hope your water supply is poisoned by a catastrophic oil spill
2935 2018-11-09 19:24:49 Ads pushing plastic toys & junk food at kids-FINE, ads encouraging people to spend money hey don’t have-COOL, ad pointing out the horrors of the palm oil industry-Oh no, we can’t have that! Twats!
2936 2018-11-09 19:24:41 she's awesome!!!  Good ole coconut oil...not the processed either but the unrefined.
2937 2018-11-09 19:24:38 Ai u just kiyaye ppl that were once in love, if you interfere you'll be shamed last last, especially fr ppl like us that can manipulate minds

2939 2018-11-09 19:24:32 Palm oil deforestation is, oh gosh, so horrible, I agree, especially for shampoo, but good golly, can you do any better than a Liberian Palm Butter and Chicken, for a dinner with friends? I'd have to just denounce all my principles for that one thing. I wish you could taste it.
2940 2018-11-09 19:24:23 This is part of the propaganda plan courtesy of the #torybbc ! The fact of the matter though is clear that the world is moving away from oil and gas with the new battery technologies that are constantly evolving!
2941 2018-11-09 19:24:19 Chocolate is one of the worst offenders I'm afraid. Some factories have been known to clean the machines with peanut oil. We've always been advised to avoid . #sorry #nutallergy
2942 2018-11-09 19:24:16 Lol they also voted no on prop 112 which would have made it harder for oil drilling and fracking in the state but it's fine
2943 2018-11-09 19:24:11 I use pretty much all of their products, but I’d say the essentials are the oil facial cleanser, probiotic gel moisturizer, and squalane + vit c rose oil

2945 2018-11-09 19:24:04 A close 2nd . . We got oil . . No dosh !
2946 2018-11-09 19:23:59 prob cos no oil in it
2947 2018-11-09 19:23:53 There isn't really any such thing as sustainable palm oil once you're growing it at industrial scale. If you dig into the sustainability criteria, you find in some countries, the government basically just gets to call it sustainable by saying it is
2948 2018-11-09 19:23:46 I do (bother to read labels and refuse products with palm/ oil). I always get suprised at things like plain biscuits or chocs that have been around for years, before palm became fashionable (for lack of better word) all containing them. Did they always, did we just not notice?
2949 2018-11-09 19:23:46 So glad to see Justin's support of Canada's Oil and Gas industry immediately after this recent flawed KXL ruling, (particularly after these environmental concerns were rejected twice by the EPA but Obama veto'd it anyway)....oh, wait.
2950 2018-11-09 19:23:40 The white mint tic tacs, minty gum, peppermint essential oils, sea sick bracelet, cbd oil, anti anxiety medication, phone games, reading, things to distract your mind all of these things help
2951 2018-11-09 19:23:40 I’m not an @IcelandFoods customer but now After watching the banned Christmas advert I’m going to be, hate the use of palm oil in products and it’s hard to get away from, also I’ve heard they have a cracking #vegan range  #IcelandChristmasAdvert thankyou @IcelandFoods
2952 2018-11-09 19:23:40 If @IcelandFoods made a Rang-tan soft toy/teddie and donated the proceeds to help stop the palm oil plantations and deforestation. I know I would buy more than one! #NoPalmOilChristmas

2964 2018-11-09 19:21:56 I'm struggling to see what's so political about it. It's fact, cold hard fact. I'd rather not have palm oil and I agree with Iceland's stance. Good on them.
2965 2018-11-09 19:21:42 Free market for anyone’s oil but the stuff in Canada because of the left wing’s sinister but brain dead opposition to pipelines. It is a fucking  disgrace sir.
2966 2018-11-09 19:21:37 I have used @Dove for years & had no idea they use palm oil!  so disappointing! I won’t be buying anymore of their products. That’s it from me. I might be only one person, but if we all take a stand like this, maybe these brands will start to listen? #PalmOil

2969 2018-11-09 19:21:04 Instead of going after high sugary foods, Jamie Oliver should be going after food companies that use palm oil.
2970 2018-11-09 19:20:59 I’m sorry, I want to keep up with you. Your argument is that the water is not drinkable so any contaminants from an oil leak should be irrelevant when it comes to your water supply and surrounding soil? Furthermore, all of the states it travels through have similar situations?
2971 2018-11-09 19:20:57 Ryan, stay on message. The impending rise in oil prices is going to screw the international market AND JA's econ.. pass the message along to OPEC too.#PlzNThx
2972 2018-11-09 19:20:56 Lol the oil money thing doesn't guarantee success.  Especially as City already has all the money already so nothing to say they won't just keep winning.  Firstly just hope FSG if they sell it's to a set of responsible owners...
2973 2018-11-09 19:20:40 And this is the reason people should learn to mind there business 

Seriously 
2974 2018-11-09 19:20:37 lotus oil + moonstone today.
2975 2018-11-09 19:20:34 Without Keystone XL, Canada already accounts for 40% of US oil imports. Venezuela is only 9%.

2977 2018-11-09 19:20:30 Took my car in for a free oil change and they gave me this loaner.  Big pimpin' this weekend.  DJ Dan-O style baby.  
2978 2018-11-09 19:20:24 Political? You should hang your heads in shame, Iceland have done what the majority of companies have not... Tackled the issue of palm oil and raised awareness on just how serious this issue is....... Shameful
2979 2018-11-09 19:20:16 It’s such a good ad especially since it raises awareness of the importance of protecting our wildlife from human destruction. I appreciate that you’ve removed palm oil from your products. The Ad shouldn’t have been banned! X
2980 2018-11-09 19:20:09 Stop the slaughter for Palm Oil, Not Worth the cost
2981 2018-11-09 19:20:01 Oil down, dollar up, and market head south compliments of @realDonaldTrump. This is the market that the Republicans will bring you with their trade war in tow. Serves the fools right who voted for @republicans. Get ready for a correction next week.
2982 2018-11-09 19:20:00 Lol something he admitted to doing and was evident, everyone knows, it was even the Hausa and Yoruba community mosques.
Mr obi didn't deny doing it pls.
2983 2018-11-09 19:20:00 Mr.#Trump is an updated version of #Hitler. 
#Americans addicted politicians have been #sanctions.
 American politicians ignore the crimes of #Saudi_Arabia  because of the #Oil. They know well that #Iran‌ is getting stronger every day
2984 2018-11-09 19:19:55 رئيس مجلس الأمة مرزوق الغانم: بناءً على طلب عدد من زملائي النواب وجهت دعوة إلى الحكومة والنواب لعقد اجتماع يوم الأحد في قاعة مكتب المجلس لبحث تداعيات وآثار هطول الأمطار الغزيرة على المواطنين وتعاطي الجهاز الحكومي وتعاملهم مع أضرار المواطنين الناتجة عن هذه الكوارث
2985 2018-11-09 19:19:55 need to cozy up to an oil guy
2986 2018-11-09 19:19:54 تنفي الادارة العامة للعلاقات والإعلام الامني بوزارة الداخلية مايتم تداوله عبر بعض وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي عن احتمال إطلاق صفارات الانذار في جميع أنحاء البلاد مؤكدة ان الخبر عاراً عن الصحة ويفتقد الى المصداقية.
2987 2018-11-09 19:19:49 Orangutans vs Palm oil. In West Kalimantan, Borneo, a forest is cleared at the rate of one football pitch every 25 SEC's. Kudos to @IcelandFoods Pls support by sharing banned video online @AnneatSaveMe @PeterEgan6 @ChrisGPackham @rickygervais @willtravers
2988 2018-11-09 19:19:49 Currently try to check for sustainable  palm oil, but this all seems complex.
2989 2018-11-09 19:19:45 You have to wonder how many of the add execs have interest in flogging or advertising palm oil.
2990 2018-11-09 19:19:41 Or there is lots of supply, My take is a huge oil to gas conversion.
2991 2018-11-09 19:19:32 On the sell we just filling the gaps - all healthy price action - oil trying to stay over $60 :)
2992 2018-11-09 19:19:26 Just used a Kiehls sample and it has palm oil in it. Not cool.
2993 2018-11-09 19:19:23 same man. but you don’t have to go anywhere with that new THC oil vape you have, which i’m most definitely not jealous about
2994 2018-11-09 19:19:12 Look Iceland is taking Palm oil out of its products #NoPalmOilChristmas  fab!!!
2995 2018-11-09 19:19:04 I knew that wasn’t going to pass lmao the only thing I’m worried about are my brakes nd i need my oil changed HELLA BAD
2996 2018-11-09 19:19:04 @iamrakeshbansal Gm-maine oct me kaha tha ki cruide oil ke price kam honge 85 se 70 ho gaya hai.Ab 27 nov se price badne start honge 27 ke baad cruide down nahi hoga

2998 2018-11-09 19:18:55 The irony of holing a sign that essentially says “No Oil Pipeline” in front of a road, full of vehicles, fueled by oil products, delivered by pipeline.
2999 2018-11-09 19:18:54 Markets are constantly in a state of uncertainty & money is made by discounting the obvious & betting on the unexpected.

3002 2018-11-09 19:18:34 Both are true and both must be dealt with. Shut down the oil companies polluting the air and water and let indigenous people manage the land like they did for thousands of years
3003 2018-11-09 19:18:27 But let it has an indescribable delicacy for the use beaver oil.
3004 2018-11-09 19:18:22 They also let Franco have the oil on the never never
3005 2018-11-09 19:18:19 The Oil did turn the tides for a while after Katz made his presence known early in the season. I liked the power move.
3006 2018-11-09 19:18:14 So glad Trudeau sticking up for Canada, though, in his statement in favour of our oil industry and voicing his displeasure with this decision...just like he did when Keystone was initially rejected under Obama. LOL
3007 2018-11-09 19:18:04 Baby oil!! Just keep it away from the scalp above his eyes in case of sweat. But after a bath just oil him down
3008 2018-11-09 19:17:58 Lah
3009 2018-11-09 19:17:52 Eh? I never criticised their policy on palm oil, that’s not PR. What is shameful is taking an already banned advert, changing nothing, then claiming it as your own Christmas advert and kicking up a stink on social media that it is banned so people share, like and retweet away.
3010 2018-11-09 19:17:47 I sell food (oil, milk, hot chocolate drink, teabags, sardines and other canned products)from the UK and sometimes clothes and shoes
3011 2018-11-09 19:17:42 You’ll be cruelty free when you stop using palm oil... until then it’s just words
3012 2018-11-09 19:17:39 Every ironing board I ever used when I opened it sounds like a witch being boiled in oil...
3013 2018-11-09 19:17:36 So it seems that you are ok with using oil but have the NIMBY attitude for when it comes to transportation of it.
3014 2018-11-09 19:17:30 Gm-maine oct me kaha tha ki cruide oil ke price kam honge 85 se 70 ho gaya hai.Ab 27 nov se price badne start honge 27 ke baad cruide down nahi hoga

3016 2018-11-09 19:17:00 Just went in for oil change and price went up fast AF for all the recommendations I need 
3017 2018-11-09 19:16:53 So are we left with only olive oil and peanut oil?
3018 2018-11-09 19:16:52 Oh yes of course. And forgetting that glorious V10 and it’s inevitable thirst for oil... I once ran the tiny tank dry in an E60 M5 in 160 miles - on a German Autobahn of course...
3019 2018-11-09 19:16:51 As in no sense at all! Its so shameful.
3020 2018-11-09 19:16:31 But how will big oil make money if we care about our planet?
3021 2018-11-09 19:16:31 This advert is absolutely brilliant and it's bloody necessary that this important message is shared far & wide. But instead it's banned and the serious issue of palm oil is brushed aside? Ridiculous.
3022 2018-11-09 19:16:16 The irony of holing a sign that essentially says “No Oil Pipeline” in front of a road, full of vehicles, fueled by oil products, delivered by pipeline.

3025 2018-11-09 19:16:02 Ya im not saying rid the world of oil completely bud. Cause yes we do need it cause of the ways we live from day to day. But we need to reduce the amount we use to the point where we can or create a safer element of power. We created the use of oil as it stands.

3031 2018-11-09 19:15:27 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
3032 2018-11-09 19:15:27 Do you even reason?
3033 2018-11-09 19:15:24 Heard yesterday at Physio

Older lady in next room says to physio "You hear about this new oil CBD?" "They've taken out the stuff that gets you high TLC" 

Laughed so hard I almost feel off massage table with needed in my ass

3044 2018-11-09 19:14:41 iceland came through w their advert about the consequences of palm oil farming
3045 2018-11-09 19:14:38 Hit me with a follow. I deal with HPC centers and massive deep well interpretations. I have been working for the Oil and Gas industry for over 25 years.
3046 2018-11-09 19:14:27 Crude oil futures for Dec/Jan lower Friday afternoon. $WTI_Crude -0.82% at $59.96, $NBZ_F -1.02% at $69.93, $USO -0.97% at $12.72 for 11/09/18.

3048 2018-11-09 19:14:17 Yet they still stock plenty of brands of foods which contain palm oil 
3049 2018-11-09 19:14:13 As I said I would I trimmed the $DWT oil short by 20% just now. Metrics of the position improved with unrealized gain now 27%. Went from a hell of an unrealized loss to flat (that's a win) on a decent size position. #OOTT
Watching now and wondering if we get oversold or hit $55?
3050 2018-11-09 19:14:11 @JREpodcast I want to buy CBD oil or balm from my hands and feet but I saw a report from Texas saying people are mixing them illegally with other chemicals and stuff what brand do you recommend buying?
3051 2018-11-09 19:14:08 The UK claims to be a world leader in tackling climate change and/or other environmental issues but have proposed no action on the report by scientists' findings that animal agriculture is the largest cause of climate change... and now they've censored the Iceland ad on palm oil
3052 2018-11-09 19:14:04 Bio oil is my go to for scaring and stretch marks. Anything with high vitamin e is great
3053 2018-11-09 19:13:54 @AndrewScheer  The best way to build a pipeline is to bring it to Cornwall Ontario, that way you can load the oil on ships and bring it out to Sea bypassing Quebec land. Plus Cornwall has the cheapest electricity in Ontario. If you wanted to refine the oil.
3054 2018-11-09 19:13:42 Like oil? You'll love wind!
3055 2018-11-09 19:13:30 yeah but they had to know all those rigs wouldn't have helped. this recent #oil tank is all @realDonaldTrump and #MIGA
3056 2018-11-09 19:13:28 Hey Jon! The certified organic & fair trade palm oil we use in our bar soaps comes from small-holder farms in western Ghana (through our own sister company, Serendipalm)—where oil palms have been grown for centuries; (1)
3057 2018-11-09 19:13:27 Need for approval with a high price. Luxury is snake oil and its side effects are psychosomatic.
3058 2018-11-09 19:13:27 Unfortunately this is not uncommon, Saudi Arabia gets away with many human rights abuses, but it's the oil!  Bullshit.  Perhaps the most corrupt country in the world.
3059 2018-11-09 19:13:20 So this article basically says: Are fish oil supplements good for you? Maybe, maybe not. What a waste of my time.

3062 2018-11-09 19:13:09 - the stove to heat. A little oil in the bottom and a few quickly chopped shallots. Before putting the meat skin side down in the pan. It sizzles. She tosses some pepper and salt on. A sprig of rosemary in the pan.

3064 2018-11-09 19:12:49 Where do you draw the line? The Rainforest Alliance good; Ethical Tea Partnership bad? Fairtrade Coffee good; Direct Trade coffee bad? United Silence of Palm Oil good; Awareness of Palm Oil bad?
3065 2018-11-09 19:12:33 @realDonaldTrump mr big brain, oil is having an issue. It’s tanking. pun intended. Market still falling, mr deal maker. Wharton must be a cake walk.
3066 2018-11-09 19:12:31 I actually have the very same problem, i recently started using Jamaican oil.
3067 2018-11-09 19:12:31 Hint - oilsands project economics typically span 30-50 years not a shorter term like the rest of the oil & gas industry in Alberta.
3068 2018-11-09 19:12:25 I'll always remember being stopped in Theodore Roosevelt Nat'l Park for Zinke's motorcade (5 black SUV speeding through - w/ no traffic or security threat) He was in town for the Williston Oil Convention as a keynote, spoke about selling public land to industry.
3069 2018-11-09 19:12:20 However, it was never Iceland’s intention to use its Christmas advert to support a political campaign – rather to raise awareness and solidify our position on not using palm oil in food production. 2/2
3070 2018-11-09 19:12:16 what's wrong with so many scottish voters? - originally duped over oil, duped in 2014 - they really should have learned not to trust unionists. Default - assume all they say in false.
3071 2018-11-09 19:12:05 @sharon3003 the advert wasn’t approved by advertising regulators as it was seen to be in support of a political issue. The production and widespread usage of palm oil is a complex and sometimes controversial matter. 1/2
3072 2018-11-09 19:12:04 Now he's Down
3073 2018-11-09 19:12:03 Yeah, I just barely got it and I'm not far into things.  I think it's shortly after you get an oil wagon for a train robbery.

And I don't know if taking a fishing pole will work or not.

3078 2018-11-09 19:11:36 Pero no mezclemos. El regulador puede trocear Standard Oil para corregir los efectos perversos que a veces el libre mercado conlleva (paradójicamente que deja de ser libre)
3079 2018-11-09 19:11:35 @fi_joh this makes me sad... I love palm oil but I wish they rebuild the forest and plant more trees after they destroy it...
3080 2018-11-09 19:11:30 It’s easy to get swept up in national coverage of candidates, but WA appears to have signaled to corporations that they can spend record amounts of money to get their way. No to a carbon fee (thanks, big oil) and no to local soda taxes (thanks, big beverage).
3081 2018-11-09 19:11:04 I had an idea to cure multiple diseases without looking for "snake oil" if your interested send me a message ok
3082 2018-11-09 19:11:03 And yet nuclear power, which is far cheaper and far, far cleaner than oil, LNG, coal and even solar (production of solar is dirty), is shunned by all including “environmentalists”. Cost to build a nuclear plant:10-12 billion. What a dumb species we are.

Я честно пыталась проследить логику >_<
3084 2018-11-09 19:10:58 Notice more bearishness in oil markets of late but a cautious reminder that a market requiring 100 million barrels per day of supply to meet demand is heavy-duty and any demand surprise, geopolitical flashpoint or spare capacity issue can arise. Watch Iran export levels & OPEC.
3085 2018-11-09 19:10:56 No. But the article draws a comparison with the squandering of state - taxation - oil revenue by Thtacher.

3087 2018-11-09 19:10:52 He means that the banning massively heightens reporting on the ad - we are all talking about palm oil
3088 2018-11-09 19:10:51 @GoldenWonderUK is the palm oil used in your crisps sustainable?

3092 2018-11-09 19:10:34 Iceland are NOT a political group...they are a company selling food concerned about palm oil production and it's impact on animals & the environment...Shame on you for banning it 
3093 2018-11-09 19:10:30 Your statement is bullshit. We've seen the ad; being against deforestation is not political. The fact is that you have 2 boardmembers who benefit from deforestation in Malaysia and one who owns shares of a Palm Oil processor. That's the real story here.
3094 2018-11-09 19:10:29 It is a wonderful video. Well done Emma for the voice over. Recently I needed to buy a large cake for a celebration. It was exceedingly difficult to find one without palm oil, but I did it! I wonder how many people check the ingredients in bakeries and well-known cake outlets. 
3095 2018-11-09 19:10:26 Okay!
3096 2018-11-09 19:10:21 @svd66q so you won't follow back
3097 2018-11-09 19:10:18 @IcelandFoods I’ve just watched your video on palm oil and saving the #orangutans home i personally think it’s a great advert I can’t understand why they have banned it. Surely it will make us humans realise what we are doing to these amazing animals!
3098 2018-11-09 19:10:06 The plant itself generally has about .05 ppm of THC, enough for buzz... if you smoke the entire plant in one sitting.
When CBD oil is processed, the THC is removed but the pain relieving contents derived from CBD remains.
I recently did some research on this. Buy it on Amazon.

3101 2018-11-09 19:09:54 Always something!!! 

This time, "oil!" Next time, probably, the price of wool in Afghanistan! Then, perhaps, an unidentified nuclear sub sighted off Santa Barbara...  Chaos and uncertainty every where!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Our leaders have lost control!!!!!!!!!
3102 2018-11-09 19:09:53 LOL - the internet and software that allows you to trade your stocks sure as hell didn't come out of agriculture or oil&gas. How about we need each other? Rural people have such a chip on the shoulders and an outsized perception of how important they are to the country.
3103 2018-11-09 19:09:48 Totally agree it’s shocking and a perfectly good advert which I didn’t find political in any sense! It was to inform that Iceland are removing palm oil from its own products 
3104 2018-11-09 19:09:40 Drilling for oil is fine  (with safe regulation obviously) ...

.... it's the burning of it for energy which is stupid.

Without oil there's no plastic, lubrication or a multitude of other uses most people take for granted.
3105 2018-11-09 19:09:35 I had peanut butter without palm oil for that reason 

It was awful
3106 2018-11-09 19:09:32 Alright obviously oil change places lie when they say you need an oil change every 3k miles... how often should I get it changed?
3107 2018-11-09 19:09:23 Delighted to be on @Abbey_104 telling every one about our Dorset grown Facial oil. Thank you so much for having me @TiggyWalker and @terry_bennett16 x
3108 2018-11-09 19:09:20 Hemp-based CBD oil is how I get through anxious events. It is great for anxiety.
3109 2018-11-09 19:09:18 I had a good ass morning. Just for it to go to shit. I have an overdraft charge on my bank account because @ESEA charged me after i had cancelled my auto renew 3 times. And now im stuck at a shop getting my oil changed with a 3. Hour. Wait. Kms.
3110 2018-11-09 19:09:10 Please save us from all these unending chat.
3111 2018-11-09 19:09:03 My TMJ gave me a terrible tension headache. Been miserable the last hour. Gonna buy some CBD oil rn to help me get thru this.
3112 2018-11-09 19:09:02 Oil prices fell to multi-month lows as global supply increased and investors worried about the impact on fuel demand of lower economic growth and trade disputes.
3113 2018-11-09 19:08:49 That's a very disgusting way to look at it. So what if it's a cynical PR move. It highlights the issue on a real problem! Habitat destruction to palm oil
3114 2018-11-09 19:08:46 When Oil was going up it was worrisome becoz of rising CAD, now when it is going down , worry is that global growth slowing down...argument can be made according to situation
3115 2018-11-09 19:08:46 THC Oil for vapes really is the future. I haven’t had to pick up in weeks

3118 2018-11-09 19:08:38 I just rem when some munafiks screen grab my tweets and sent to my Ex, the one I was asking for advice.
It really escalated so quick, became so heated up that family was involved.
After the ish she revealed who the munafik was and even their chat to me.

3119 2018-11-09 19:08:34 Interesting letter, especially that he sites the carbon tax and emissions cap as making Canada an environmental leader in the international oil industry.
3120 2018-11-09 19:08:29 @JakeReesMogg May's plans R progressing we will now see Hammond pressure Brexit by constantly filling the media with economy fear stories such as prices on food etc increasing oil + gas problems + so on already today economy been good Hammond says the future is not due to Brexit

3124 2018-11-09 19:08:06 Remember when I thought up the amazing idea to put perfume oil into an aromatherapy humidifier? Don’t do it I think it gave me pneumonia
3125 2018-11-09 19:07:53 OK well now I’m aware of Palm Oil and going to shop more at Iceland
3126 2018-11-09 19:07:41 There is no totalitarianism. Stop selling this snake oil. BTW Nazis were also socialists.
3127 2018-11-09 19:07:38 People say data is the new oil. 

Data is not the new oil. 

Oil runs cars, engines, creates power. 

Data is fearless, quiet, and is far from a finite resource. Yet proper control of data can convince billions to waste 6 hours a day on thier phone.

Data... Data runs everything
3128 2018-11-09 19:07:30 When you get a oil change and they say it’s gone take a hour never takes that long 
3129 2018-11-09 19:07:23 I have that one and a few others and always use them . I think I need something beyond oil  lol
3130 2018-11-09 19:07:21 for my bday @aaautummm is paying for me to get my oil changed & if that isn’t true love then idk what is
3131 2018-11-09 19:07:21 All Iceland are doing is saying our products don,t contain palm oil. What is political about that. If people then shop at Iceland it is what people want. Hopefully by banning the advert will give more publicity than showing it. Well done Iceland
3132 2018-11-09 19:07:18 I get the same thing in fall/winter, it total ass LMAO
have you tried doing warm compresses daily with a slightly damp washcloth? O: They also have microwavable masks that are more effective. Also blinking exercises! Helps with ur oil glands in ur eyelids if u dont blink fully..
3133 2018-11-09 19:07:14 Yes!! Palm oil is super destructive. 
Avoiding animal products in general is a great move too, since animal agriculture is the leading cause of rainforest deforestation.
3134 2018-11-09 19:07:09 Currently the best solar panels are 22% while oil is 88%. A big difference
3135 2018-11-09 19:07:07 Oh good! Where’s the molli railway?
3136 2018-11-09 19:07:04 I don’t wanna sound like a cuck but.. show  them some oil
3137 2018-11-09 19:06:55 Can anyone recommend an alternative to Nutella. One that does not have any palm oil in it. I’m looking for one as my niece’s weekend breakfast treat. Thanks x
3138 2018-11-09 19:06:52 Oh for sure. Iceland are certainly pushing a more ethical palm oil agenda, which is no bad thing.
3139 2018-11-09 19:06:51 There is a good word for people like this:

Churlish
3140 2018-11-09 19:06:49 The oil price has been an average of $70-$80 for a while now. That’s more than enough considering the budget benchmark
3141 2018-11-09 19:06:46 $101 for a oil change 
I’m taking this 2018 back ASAP fuk dat 
3142 2018-11-09 19:06:40 boil it and then add virgin olive oil and salt, serve with white rice and steak if you eat meat. thank me later
3143 2018-11-09 19:06:26 I heard the oil is actually one of the better ones! I’ve tried powder and CBD infused water and those didn’t work nearly as well as the flower.
3144 2018-11-09 19:06:25 Oh come on @marksandspencer you dont need to use palm oil so why have you?
Let's ditch palm oil, please?
3145 2018-11-09 19:06:24 Use the oil I use and you will need to cut it

3148 2018-11-09 19:06:21 The best solar panels are 22% efficient, while oil is 88%. That’s a big difference. Until solar gets closer to that 88% it’s just not efficient or reliable.

3150 2018-11-09 19:06:11 Bonus! My 2 hour oil change wait now has dueling cell phones playing videos at full blast! One one each side. Is there a law that says if you are over 60 you don't need to use a headset?

3159 2018-11-09 19:05:45 @Botanygeek has tweeted about the complexity of palm oil sourcing before. But if you fly into Kuala Lumpur the expanses of monoculture are striking, each palm in its own little patch like so many embroidery knots
3160 2018-11-09 19:05:35 Hey CBD Oil Lab(@cbdoillab), thank you for following me
3161 2018-11-09 19:05:35 I didn't realise we had one of the #MyTrusty innovators in @theQCommunity. I am a big advocate of the #MyTrusty face oil @CarolLRead. I am taking some back to Aus for my mum this Christmas!
3162 2018-11-09 19:05:31 Stir fried sprouts with chilli, sesame oil, garlic, maple syrup and soy are a winner too.
3163 2018-11-09 19:05:24 It's this way because this is how the oil industry wanted it, they are a "victim" of their own decisions.
3164 2018-11-09 19:05:23 The situation in Indonesia is disgusting- corrupt govt, local farmers trying to make a living, charities and NGO’s ensuring sustainable and responsible palm oil but money talks.

3167 2018-11-09 19:05:14 The christmas ad race is increasingly ugly. That Iceland have even managed to spin this as Christmas (their tweets are something like ‘we’re inviting shoppers to have a palm oil free xmas’) is ridiculous. Free PR and literally nothing will change.
3168 2018-11-09 19:05:12 look, if there was a Good Things machine, powered by oil, that just made the world better, would you turn it on?? makes you think
3169 2018-11-09 19:04:56 Iceland Palm Oil ad ban should be lifted
3170 2018-11-09 19:04:42 Every flavor of milk tea at the place I used to work used palm oil derivatives and sugar. Products were made in Taiwan.
3171 2018-11-09 19:04:38 So what you are saying is that you dont agree with oil either? But are willing to keep it that way until something safer arrives? Not putting words in your mouth just trying to understand where you stand.

3175 2018-11-09 19:04:16 Totally not crying (I am). I know palm oil is bad but sometimes you need something pure and simple to drive the message home.  Well done and shame it’s to ‘real’ for tv.

3182 2018-11-09 19:03:54 I am surprised no data on China. Most ppl there use omega 6 oil
3183 2018-11-09 19:03:51 Yes I was earlier,I think food labelling should be more informative,so consumers can see if palm oil included,more often it’s hidden in some form or other,big companies at it all time deceiving us and getting away with it,palm curse of the modern age because it’s cheap and nasty
3184 2018-11-09 19:03:34 Plus je regarde les infos et plus je ne supporte plus l’indécence qu’il y a à mélanger commémoration de la guerre et annonces sur le gaz oil, le permis et les tournées de bière 
3185 2018-11-09 19:03:32 so that means the oil light goes on and you ignore it until you get the nasty message about your car dying unless you put in oil?  That's the way I do it.  My "brake pads" light has been on for two weeks now, but they still work, so hey, no hurry.
3186 2018-11-09 19:03:26 So, let me educate you. The oil is now transported using vehicles that burn gas/diesel. TONS of CO2. This pipeline will eliminate that, instead piping the oil directly. so, the pipeline actually helps climate change morons.

3191 2018-11-09 19:02:57 But in an era when politics seems at least temporarily broken, and with a crisis that has a time limit, civil society may need to pressure the business community at least as heavily to divest their oil company shares,
3192 2018-11-09 19:02:54 Why would Fox be reporting that oil is dragging markets down, when the NASDAQ is down twice as much?
3193 2018-11-09 19:02:52 You have a lot of influence cos in the north it takes just 200 naira for women to vote and 500 for men. I was a youth corner in borno in 2011 so I know what I m talking about. You guys can have the power in aso rock but you ll continue to suffer
3194 2018-11-09 19:02:46 To be fair, "we" (as a government) don't buy anyone's oil. Privately owned business does, autonomously. Important distinction.
3195 2018-11-09 19:02:14 Ludicrous. Can't just push things under carpet as it might upset xmas shopping. I'm always read labels to try&avoid Palm oil.Shocking how many products use it!I'll forward u poster I saw.Pathetic that in our'free speaking country'u can't speak the truth if it affects consumerism!

3197 2018-11-09 19:01:50 i slept over at my moms house n while i was sleeping she went to get my car inspected, got my new tags, and is going to get my oil changed 
3198 2018-11-09 19:01:42 In Italy (which I visit often) a lot of everyday products like margarine are proudly labelled as being free of palm oil. I don’t understand why the same isn’t happening here. I’ve never shopped at @IcelandFoods but after the Xmas ad furore I may well switch ...
3199 2018-11-09 19:01:42 Yes there are. It's the know it all's the make the weather worse. It rains here. People freak out. The oil that is suppressed rises to the surface, making the roads slippery. Even knowing this they remain stupid.

3235 2018-11-09 18:59:22 It's because we make different assumptions 

Promoters of heavy oil development assume fossil fuel combustion will be the primary way of generating energy for decades to come.

This assumption is simply wishful thinking by those who have invested foolishly in old technology.
3236 2018-11-09 18:59:21 What about labelling? Will palm oil products just be labelled as oil ????
3237 2018-11-09 18:59:16 Politics ? No. Pressure from those making money from palm oil products maybe ? Oh dear. Very disappointing.
3238 2018-11-09 18:59:13 Check ALL ingredients. Cosmetics AND food products. Palm oil hides under the umbrella of vegetable oil - force manufactures to label accurately.  As I have a sesame allergy, this is something I do out of necessity. Everyone needs to do this.
3239 2018-11-09 18:59:07 this 20% sharp break in crude is causing global economic shock to oil producers in many parts of the world, if it holds continues, it could cause many loans to not be paid, resulting in the dreaded D word that being Default, this is where banks suffer...
3240 2018-11-09 18:59:05 Keep oil in your lamp. Your time is coming
3241 2018-11-09 18:59:01 Brent oil drops below $70.

Natural gas price hits $3.7/MMBtu
3242 2018-11-09 18:58:50 The Alberta oil industry was subsidises ~$3 million last year, this brought it's revenues above its costs. Without subsidies the industry would die, we should let it.
3243 2018-11-09 18:58:45 For me personally... (sorry not vegan) Flour, oil, eggs, Sweetner, raisins, rum flavouring (sooooo much cheaper) black treacle. Cheapest not salted nuts to decorated (put on top before baking)..? Just thoughts....
3244 2018-11-09 18:58:37 I think OPEC need more time to make it clear what to do next. Voice interventions will bring some support for the prices after Abu-Dhabi meeting but not make them fly. We need to wait until next meeting on december 6 in Vienna. Still believing it's not a bottom for oil.
3245 2018-11-09 18:58:32 Have you seen the new Iceland advert about palm oil?
3246 2018-11-09 18:58:32 soaked in argan oil
3247 2018-11-09 18:58:31 Done.
3248 2018-11-09 18:58:21 Palm oil in Quorn 'beef'  #notsoenvirofriendly
3249 2018-11-09 18:58:08 Especially for you guys that work with oil coy.
3250 2018-11-09 18:58:05 Por eso, por eso: aprende a leer. Cuando aprendas, a lo mejor platicamos. Ahorita prosigue en silencio.
3251 2018-11-09 18:58:01 Beyond repair ,  the process to destroying our fl. environment started 75 years ago and still going strong. 75yesrs of sugar runoff , boat oil , city drains , fertilizer, round up , industry pollution, sunscreen. 20 more years maybe.nah...15

3253 2018-11-09 18:57:54 Congratulations for leading the way in raising awareness of the impact of palm oil once again. A fantastically produced advert which I hope goes far and wide #SayNoToPalmOil #IWantARangTan
3254 2018-11-09 18:57:53 lets say i sell jillie juice and then i say 1+1=2. 
would that make me wrong just because i am a snake oil salesman?

what a pretty fallacy you got there
3255 2018-11-09 18:57:48 Hopefully, the ban will backfire and people will do some shopping in Iceland once they learn they're removing palm oil from all its own brand products.  I like the ad.
3256 2018-11-09 18:57:44 Because humans don’t actually care enough to be inconvenienced. We buy gas from Exxon while Valdez spill oil is still on the beaches, we buy M&Ms when the chocolate is produced by child slave labor, people still have accts at Wells Fargo, we wear Nike. Voting is the same.
3257 2018-11-09 18:57:40 Oh did they?  Some of them. Not all of us by any means.  We don't have the same population as Glasgow or Edinburgh in the South, but we do have North Sea Oil and Fishing. They don't.  We to prefer to think of our own first.
3258 2018-11-09 18:57:39 nah that's just the global oil price
3259 2018-11-09 18:57:26 I got an oil change today and then they told me everything wrong with my car and I got so stressed I started laughing
3260 2018-11-09 18:57:24 Oil dropped more than 19% in the last 10 trading sessions. Its trajectory looks more downwards, good news for the oil importing countries such as Pakistan, further lower prices from here will secure our heavy import bill and save many $$$$$. Good omen for the country's economy.
3261 2018-11-09 18:57:10 True. But there’s a lot of people that work real hard for 15 an hour, like hands in the oil field for instance. So if you pay fast food workers 15 an hour they gonna have to bump up every else’s pay because them boys just ain’t gonna do it anymore. 
3262 2018-11-09 18:57:03 Between  1985 to  2015,  Nigeria was repeatedly raped by the same politicians  scheming to come back to Power. Please ask them, how much did Nigeria earn from Oil from August 27, 1985 to May 2015 (a period of 30 years). Don't buy their shit! RESIST PDP!! PDP is the problem!
3263 2018-11-09 18:57:02 This random twitter troll sounds just like a big oil industry lobbyist.
3264 2018-11-09 18:57:00 I follow both of you so I see all of this sappy stuff. All my best you kids! Now get outta here...
3265 2018-11-09 18:56:54 Horner on VERSTAPPEN's car: "Oil tower on the front of the engine and it developed a leak in FP1. Then the boys found a crack."
3266 2018-11-09 18:56:42 snake olive oil?
3267 2018-11-09 18:56:21 Ok thunder let’s go in and take the land.
Heavenly Father Thunder and I agree we want you to show us your testimony your great power as you have done before you will do again for your bride the church.

Don’t forget virgins to trim the lamps wick and have plenty of oil. 

Take US
3268 2018-11-09 18:56:18 Only a hapless socialist like Maduro could ruin a country sitting on oil
3269 2018-11-09 18:56:12 ABC News: Stocks skid as oil plunge continues; tech sector also falls

ABC News: US stocks are falling as crude oil prices are on track to drop for the 10th consecutive day, deepening a slump that began in early October...

3270 2018-11-09 18:56:10 Heard of oil pulling? The latest craze in oral care, which involves swishing coconut oil in your mouth, has many proponents. However, the ADA notes that there have been no scientific studies to prove its benefits. Consult a dentist for all your dental hygiene questions. #dentist
3271 2018-11-09 18:56:08 I was the first person here and I’ve been waiting over an hour for a fucking oil change
3272 2018-11-09 18:56:06 As an Indian I’ll suggest you resort to coconut oil (body) or 2/3 drops of ghee (face)
3273 2018-11-09 18:55:55 You obviously don’t understand the nuances affecting Venezuela - lack of diversification, relying on oil revenue coupled with the 2014 collapse and the epidemic of corruption in that country is the real issue. Not socialism.
3274 2018-11-09 18:55:47 You mean for an economy that get a huge chunk of her revenue from oil? Are you serious right now? Well
3275 2018-11-09 18:55:47 Look I just like to unwind on a Friday night by sipping cans of Neck Oil while standing in a crowded train vestibule with no air con for a couple of hours. No finer feeling. #blessed
3276 2018-11-09 18:55:36 Your hired. Now let's push this giant ball of oil out this window
3277 2018-11-09 18:55:33 Saddam sold oil for euros. Russia & China backing trading currency with gold. My opinion is that is why we are told Russia is an enemy. I lived thru the cold war. My whole life I've been told Russia is an enemy. I wish someone would tell me why
3278 2018-11-09 18:55:14 i just watched the iceland video on palm oil bc it came on my recommended and i don’t get why it was banned :( how tf is educating ppl about the destruction this product is causing ‘too political’?
3279 2018-11-09 18:55:13 U.S. hopes to work with Chinese govt and energy cos. to reduce imports of Iranian oil, Sec. of State Mike Pompeo said during meeting with Chinese counterparts in Washington.

3280 2018-11-09 18:55:10 You can't, we still need to oil the engines
3281 2018-11-09 18:55:09 I was at the @EC_magazine conference and it isn’t as simple as we’d like. Palm oil is so high yielding, more land wd be needed if we wanted same quantity from other sources. Academic advice seems to be to buy responsible palm oil and push companies to source it
3282 2018-11-09 18:55:06 Similarly, Bloomberg was also reported on oil.
3283 2018-11-09 18:54:38 I am. My family grows corn that is used to make ethanal. Yes, I use products that are created using oil, but I also try to buy things like natural fiber clothing and reusable bags and cups to reduce my contribution to the problem.
3284 2018-11-09 18:54:33 Take cool showers or at least rinse with cool water use a t shirt to dry off your hair (don’t rub just dab) sleep on a silk pillow (Walmart for like $2) wear your hair down as much as you can brush from bottom to top gently warm oil massage
3285 2018-11-09 18:54:29 This sets a dangerous precedent.
3286 2018-11-09 18:54:26 oil, s&p, gold
3287 2018-11-09 18:54:20 At least they have divested from palm oil products...
3288 2018-11-09 18:54:19 Believe me I would have loved to just dash you just exercise a lil patients
3289 2018-11-09 18:54:18 Feeding babies oil kills them dude don't do that.
3290 2018-11-09 18:54:17 this used to happen to me but now the night before i plan to shave i slather my face in castor oil n that doesn't happen. no idea what ur skin is like or if this will work for u
3291 2018-11-09 18:54:16 They have both. Their financial structure is definitely not just capitalist. Y’know what system makes Scandinavia not a failure (I wouldn’t say *success* due to their lack of socioeconomic mobility, underwhelming economic output, and cultural anxieties):   OIL
3292 2018-11-09 18:54:09 I’m glad I know how to do little things like put air in my tire, check oil, etc
3293 2018-11-09 18:54:08 The oil money has ruined the game of #soccer / #Futbol
3294 2018-11-09 18:54:03 I so get that. Besides the fact that me and speed are like oil and water, the perfectionist in me gets all anxious at leaving even one thing that isn't "just so".
I guess the reason I have built so few homes lately is that I agonize 1000 years over each detail. Speed build? ME?
3295 2018-11-09 18:53:58 When I leave to get this oil change should I go back to work? 
3296 2018-11-09 18:53:57 A weekly packet of EmergenC, lots of water, at least 7 hrs of sleep. If I'm traveling I take some oregano oil for the just-in-case.
3297 2018-11-09 18:53:57 A real and measurable *negative* difference. Every extra barrel removed, refined, and burned is bringing us one step closer to the end. We have the technological capabilities to completely abandon non-renewables today yet we don't bc of oil interest groups.
3298 2018-11-09 18:53:54 Their stallion prick topped with machine oil twisted into their ass womb
3299 2018-11-09 18:53:45 Pipelines are the best way to transport crude oil. And, if it isn’t built, Canada will sell the crude to China where it will be burned in a much less environmentally-friendly way. 
But what do I know?  I’m only a petroleum engineer. Let’s go with what the writer/artist says.
3300 2018-11-09 18:53:45 Y’all are nauseating

ly cute
3301 2018-11-09 18:53:44 Tranquilo con tu ira. Eso ya lo expliqué en un tuit anterior: sin productividad el aumento al salario sólo causa más inflación.
El punto es entender que el salario real debe mejorar, porque sin una buena demanda interna no hay crecimiento. Más razones, menos insultos. 
3302 2018-11-09 18:53:43 Fossil fuel for fossilised brains
Tarsands oil for retarded economies
Pipelines for pied pipers

3303 2018-11-09 18:53:37 Fossil fuel is a fun piñata to bash around, but it is becoming increasingly clear that dead dinosaurs aren't the source of oil, nor is man big enough to change the earth's climate. To believe Dubuque affects Galveston's climate is to be far too gullible.
3304 2018-11-09 18:53:36 someone came over to buy something off free and for sale so I put on my oil diffuser right near my door and the first thing she said was “wow it smells great in here” but I think she regretted that after taking one more step and smelled bong water layered with my soup clothes
3305 2018-11-09 18:53:32 manuka honey + tea tree oil
3306 2018-11-09 18:53:27 Ban was from @Clearcast on Iceland Palm Oil
3307 2018-11-09 18:53:24 Try my best to palm oil free but it’s so difficult and an overall boycott will never work. It’s about making it sustainable
3308 2018-11-09 18:53:22 Show some self respect Nick, nobody should retweet anything @campbellclaret had anything to do with. He colluded with Blair to murder a whole nation for oil, he should be in prison. The bloke is murdering scum.
3309 2018-11-09 18:53:22 That stuff can be rough...the itching 'bout drove me crazy. The silver cream worked pretty well, but the virgin coconut oil was what soothed my burn best. Good blessings and healing energy to you both! 
3310 2018-11-09 18:53:09 Thin and disempowered middle class. Why do you think the Mississippi delta is the way it is? Fertile soil, good rivers, oil wealth and yet..... the same type of policies that made these states the way the are, is what Republicans want to do in Ohio. We'll become those places /2
3311 2018-11-09 18:53:02 Ouvir posições contrárias à maioria e em especial a sua própria é essencial, tanto na vida quanto, no mercado.

3314 2018-11-09 18:52:45 The only special interest group is the oil industry. How is $280,000,000,000 in unfunded environmental mess in Canada’s best interest??
3315 2018-11-09 18:52:42 No cause palm oil substitutes are often worse
3316 2018-11-09 18:52:40 So moving. It's not just our food products either, palm oil is used in a lot of our biofuels
3317 2018-11-09 18:52:40 I make a beeswax cream with Geranium  oil and neem oil, reports are good. Why not try it for you eczema.
3318 2018-11-09 18:52:33 If you're interested in trying a CBD oil we'd love to help you! Ask us any questions you may have!
3319 2018-11-09 18:52:30 For what little it will do I’ve signed the petition. I was unaware of the whole palm oil issue.
3320 2018-11-09 18:52:25 Bravo, Iceland. Both for supporting the palm oil campaign, and for the stunt which will do far, far, more to change people's behaviour than if you'd paid for the TV airtime. Iceland will make much money this Christmas because of this, and deserves to.
3321 2018-11-09 18:52:11 Totally, cold hands and phone screens mix like oil and water.
3322 2018-11-09 18:51:57 Shame on you banning the @IcelandFoods adverts.  We need to stop the use of palm oil to save these beautiful creatures from extinction
3323 2018-11-09 18:51:53 NO,, look at ALL the high paying jobs,,, Also, do you walk to work, light your house with candles? watch TV,,, we NEED Oil and GAS
3324 2018-11-09 18:51:48 Spiritual weapons. The Grain, The Wine and The Oil
3325 2018-11-09 18:51:38 she's verified though so it balances out
3326 2018-11-09 18:51:33 I think there's maybe another facet to the argument. There was always going to be an Iceland advert this year, centred on Christmas. It was inevitable. And the positive thing is, *this one* creates outrage about deforestation for palm oil. So the ad is... good?
3327 2018-11-09 18:51:30 coconut oil
3328 2018-11-09 18:51:28 I need you to visit your local Ques & try some oil  cause baby that’s JUICE right there
3329 2018-11-09 18:51:28 And ev'ry apostrophe is a drop of oil and pow'r!! lol!
3330 2018-11-09 18:51:23 Every picture tells a story & this one is so terribly sad. As consumers we need to stop buying products containing Palm Oil
3331 2018-11-09 18:51:21 Kale nachinjishepo tu oil still more fye.. 
3332 2018-11-09 18:51:20 Almond oil  mixed with a little vitiman e oil
3333 2018-11-09 18:51:18 So, yes it's good Iceland is removing palm oil.  However labelling it as "our banned TV ad" is not. It is NOT their ad, It was made by @SalonAlpin for @Greenpeace on World Orangutan Day (August 19th) TAKING VIDEO AND PASSING IT OFF AS YOUR OWN, EVEN FOR A GOOD CAUSE, IS NOT OK.
3334 2018-11-09 18:51:18 Oil ka kuva leke pakode talenge.
3335 2018-11-09 18:51:11 Prices up, countries deficit is out of control, trade war going on, strong economy? Stock market in the sub-basement and sinking, oil down, your economy is going downhill real fast. @realDonaldTrump

3379 2018-11-11 23:56:31 I would try to find the best loaf of bread and olive oil possible. And wine. Also pasta carbonara. Oh and they have these cookies made with almond flour that are unbelievable and every time BF’s brings them back I eat a dozen with no shame or guilt.
3380 2018-11-11 23:56:10 Don't talk about being broke until you've used olive oil at subway as lotion
3381 2018-11-11 23:56:08 I forgot to take oil rights into account!
3382 2018-11-11 23:56:05 Then why did you serve?  No one joins to protect oil prices....
3383 2018-11-11 23:56:02 I like... rub oil onto my dry face and then emulsify directly hahaha
3384 2018-11-11 23:55:59 I was a teenager in the 80s - people were still tanning with baby oil and even foil to intensify rays. Now I know that was horrible.
3385 2018-11-11 23:55:43 #Venezuela's oil prod. .... the govt is still targeting a 1 mil b/d increase" The risk of hiring Lewis Carroll's followers as your strategy & production designers and planners  ...
3386 2018-11-11 23:55:43 Ain’t that oil hot fam? You supposed to have on gloves to take the old oil filter out
3387 2018-11-11 23:55:39 Is it enough to stop falling price tag of #oil. I guess so but not expect sudden highs. We may have some yearly lows before real turn. I say wait and see is a safe tactic than become bear or bull now #oott #usoil #crudeoil though i am bull for the end of the year #brent
3388 2018-11-11 23:55:37 具体的には週に二回ジムに行って、週末に温泉に行ってサウナキメるって生活なんですけど、やるときはやるし休むときは休むってメリハリがついてて凄い良いですねー
3389 2018-11-11 23:55:37 Today’s Sunday. So U should indulge. I heard olive oil is not that great when it’s warmed up. Better only when used naturally
3390 2018-11-11 23:55:31 The orangutan is stealing some palm oil. POWER TO THE PEOPLE!
3391 2018-11-11 23:55:24 Would flooding the deserts help stop global warming? THAT WOULD BE A GREAT USE FOR THE  USELESS "OIL" SLUDGE KEYSTONE PIPELINE ! GIVE IT A TRY !!
3392 2018-11-11 23:55:07 Also Hansen never said that we would cause the earths oceans to boil. He said that hypothetically 'if you put about ten times as much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as you would get from burning all the coal, oil, and gas' it might happen.
3393 2018-11-11 23:55:05 Sweet! Thanks for the tip! I’m excited to try it  my legs tend to get insanely dry in the winter and I love body oil over lotion but it’s so expensive. This seems like a good compromise

3404 2018-11-11 23:52:53 Saudi Arabia plans to reduce oil supply to world markets by 0.5 million barrels per day in December, its energy minister said on Sunday, as the OPEC power faces uncertain prospects in its attempts to persuade other producers to agree a coordinated output cut.

But great call on oil from you last week. Thank you!
3410 2018-11-11 23:51:47 Wow got such a good oil massage
3411 2018-11-11 23:51:46 When you dry off your hair after applying all your products do you use a shirt or towel? Because using a shirt instead of a towel minimizes your frizz more. But I basically just put on my leave in conditioner, moisturizing cream or coconut oil and use the shirt then I diffuse (:
3412 2018-11-11 23:51:30 the dems cant have a thriving oil boom or it will destroy their narratives on oil and global warming and economy ... more than it already is 
3413 2018-11-11 23:51:21 First time I’ve heard about CBD Oil in that context. Any research on it?
3414 2018-11-11 23:51:16 Are the small enough you can pass on your own? I’ve had them twice. Drink lots of water it helps. It sounds really gross but I drank lemon/oil and it’s supposed to help 
3415 2018-11-11 23:51:06 system76 is like . . . a really nice tall Dodge live-in modified van that runs on vegetable oil diesel with a custom (installed-by-pro) hybrid electric battery

3417 2018-11-11 23:50:56 Yes, I know you have issues with science and the future. There will be pains. Just as the early oil industry had gushers and then collapse. It’s how business and industry works. Take an economics class.
3418 2018-11-11 23:50:46 Now we have the collapse of our habitat and we need diplomatic understanding and a new economic system not just based on consumption yet here we are with oil billionaires putting a plastic bag over our future.
3419 2018-11-11 23:50:44 Welcome to a new workweek! U.S. equity futures start off the session just barely in the red, while crude oil is the primary theme after reports OPEC will cut production in response to the recent slide in oil prices.
3420 2018-11-11 23:50:41 ME TOO theres this oil u can buy on amazon thats organic and super good for hair growth and thickness n stuff its full of fat its called amla hair oil
3421 2018-11-11 23:50:35 With pleasure! Well done for taking the step to remove palm oil from your products, and bravely creating this advert about it! Now lets hope other big companies follow suit.
3422 2018-11-11 23:50:14 I started with baby oil, but it would make the bathtub slick af. I’m too clumsy for that. 

The key is to apply while you’re still wet, then dry off excess. It’s like butter 
3423 2018-11-11 23:50:12 Because they’ve been rumbled on fake sheikh money and the Oil City Torturers and we all know the sky will fall-in before long.

3427 2018-11-11 23:49:16 toss it w/ some olive oil, and put it in the fridge - it'll last a couple of days. You can reheat by plopping it in some boiling water for a few sec, or in the microwave in a pinch. The above works best if it's a bit al dente.

3. CBD oil or drink before bed.

5. Peak sleep / recovery
6. Better fitness.
7. Higher capacity.

3439 2018-11-11 23:48:16 Seen the ad ... like the sentiment... hard to argue. Just to clarify ... are you saying that Iceland and it’s subsidiaries and sponsors ... make no monies at all from the deforestation and palm oil crops which gave devastated the orang utan ecosystem... ???

3443 2018-11-11 23:47:49 Iceland still sell palm oil products and are going to sell palm oil products in the future. People are too easily fooled. People are looking at the advert taken from greenpeace and not actually checking icelands stores for products with palm oil.
3444 2018-11-11 23:47:45 General question, if you have pants with holes or cuts in them shouldn’t you put on lotion or oil of some sorts????.... Yeah, that’s what I thought.

3454 2018-11-11 23:46:45 Jamaican Black Castor Oil helps grow ya bald spots or/and edges back, massage it into your scalp. Massaging your scalp will increase blood flow that will increase hair growth.
3455 2018-11-11 23:46:39 I make my living in the oil and gas industry. Its a bitter sweet irony. I think #climatechange is a viable threat to humanity but oil is also how I support my family. There are few jobs where I could make what I do now w/o working oilfield.   Most of which I'm ill suited for.
3456 2018-11-11 23:46:20 That's what it looks like when I dine in.
Its bread covered in cheese and soaked in garlic and oil. There is no disappointment.
3457 2018-11-11 23:46:04 A good EVOO has to first cost a bit, then it has to have certification on the label, then it has to say exactly where the oil is from, etc, etc... and now has to have the EU label on it as well, usually on the back label.

3463 2018-11-11 23:45:27 This morning after my shower I combed through while blow drying it then brushed in a little Argon oil 
3464 2018-11-11 23:45:25 If orangutans matter, then the billions of other nameless, faceless animals we kill every day for food, clothes, experiments and so on matter too. Veganism is the consistent answer to this question. Palm oil saves up to 10 times more land clearing than less efficient oils.

3471 2018-11-11 23:44:53 Yea, buying pipelines and breaking his promis to stop funding oil production is unacceptable.

3487 2018-11-11 23:42:48 Personally, this is how I see it. If they imagined they could have needed more oil, they would have brought it. Their not bringing it reflects a belief that He was coming earlier, or it didn’t matter and it would all pan out. I believe it’s about apostasy due to bad eschatology.

3500 2018-11-11 23:41:29 Which I imagine translates to: too many powerful people have varying levels of investment in Palm Oil /adjacent endeavours and would rather not draw public attention to the damage they cause.

3513 2018-11-11 23:40:03 democratic products rise, and it exacerbates industrial lobbying, something Mimi is no stranger to. Ask the big oil and drug companies she’s received almost 300,000 dollars from. I’d say this girl is making a smart choice.
3514 2018-11-11 23:40:00 There are CHILDREN forced to fight a wildfire in the USA, we’re sending troops to the border to defend against refugees, 25 orangutans are dying a day for palm oil, homeless people in DC will potentially freeze to death tonight because they keep closing shelters, and so much more
3515 2018-11-11 23:39:57 You register for selective service to die for oil & $ so some Republican can get rich, then you should be registered to vote as well.

3516 2018-11-11 23:39:52 Never viewes him as a 30-goal guy but certainly in the 20-25 range. That said, potential and opportunity doesn't make an additional 5-10 impossible.
3517 2018-11-11 23:39:47 I have fell in love with @JoshRamsay when I first saw Marianas trench’s video for “Decided to break it” on Punch much back when I was 6 years old. I got the pleasure of seeing the band live in Cold Lake imperial oil place feb 4, 2017. You walked right by and time stopped 
3518 2018-11-11 23:39:45 Defusing lavender oil and tea tree oil and I feel stoned.

This is amazing.
3519 2018-11-11 23:39:39 Great questions! I don’t know if I can deduct what characters in a parable were thinking. That’s part of why I wonder what would have happened had they run to the Bridegroom  anyway.  What were they thinking when they decided to go buy more oil?
3520 2018-11-11 23:39:38 Do you guys shampoo it or use a beard oil? Those help :33
3521 2018-11-11 23:39:32 If u dont want to see $50 for oil may be you wanna burn mid night oil ( by keeping your truck running overnight)

3527 2018-11-11 23:39:10 Nobody is going to stop big rich oil companies from making their profits. Understand the words “NOBODY” and “NEVER”

3529 2018-11-11 23:38:51 More of a department store! We sell everything from cereal to coffee to shampoo and tampons and motor oil!
3530 2018-11-11 23:38:45 Bush 2 destabilized the whole middle-east, and quadrupled oil prices.  Then, his administration's handling of the financial crisis mugged us all.
I'd rather not talk about Bubba Clinton, my wife doesn't allow me to use those words ...

3532 2018-11-11 23:38:37 Sorry, wasn’t really happening. Now exporting clean coal, large % of power generated outside US is coal powered.  US now largest oil producer & exporting gas which is main power source in Europe. Need 2 protect environment, but let’s not destroy economy. That was former reality.

3534 2018-11-11 23:38:23 If you don't want to follow Q, then don't. But with all of the influence you have, all of the situations and people you are involved with, and all of the problems going on in the world, if this "snake oil" is what you choose to focus on, it only confirms there must be more to it.
3535 2018-11-11 23:38:22 Coconut oil is such a blessing works for everything

3537 2018-11-11 23:38:13 Can you overdose on CBD oil?
3538 2018-11-11 23:38:08 Los mismos 3 dólares en #USA, pero allá la capacidad de ingresos es 5 veces o más, eso es justo?
Cuando se extrae petróleo en Col. Y hay refinería?
Sí eso es así, no exploten petróleo, conservemos el medio ambiente y paguemos los 3 dólares del caro galón de oil.

Es justo o no?

3544 2018-11-11 23:37:08 Honestly baby oil or coconut oil is my favorite things to use to get makeup off. Makeup wipes are great but oils slick that makeup off in a couple swipes
3545 2018-11-11 23:37:08 Hahaha stay classy lad. Do you remember city before the oil money? Probably not. Incase not ill remind... you were a nothing club totally off the radar. City are a doley who won the lottery thats nobody repects their achievements
3546 2018-11-11 23:37:03 All I want is someone to massage the lines between my cornrows with castor oil, I’m not asking for much
3547 2018-11-11 23:36:58 People create and believe conspiracy theories to explain things they can't understand. The cult can't understand why Trump has not made their lives better as promised. Hence Q and every other wacky theory. They can't admit they believed a snake oil salesman.

3552 2018-11-11 23:36:26 My heaven smells like clove & peppermint oil.
3553 2018-11-11 23:36:12 Realistically, the only thing an average citizen can take direct action on, is with their purchasing power.  Governments and private industry involved with natural resources are highly corrupt.  Also, does this research also account for palm oil used in biofuel?
3554 2018-11-11 23:36:06 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
3555 2018-11-11 23:36:05 Palm oil in shampoo is a fraction of the issue. Palm oil is reducing poverty and feeding the developing world. The real problem for rainforests? Too many humans (10 billion by 2050) and that is the underlying message of the commercial, ‘there’s a human in my forest...’
3556 2018-11-11 23:35:59 I wanna be one of the people who clean ducks with dish soap after oil spills

3561 2018-11-11 23:35:10 Your tweet has led me to sign a petition and donate to the cause to stop palm oil vampires decimating animals homelands. X
3562 2018-11-11 23:34:34 My favorite way to make them is to fry them lightly in oil and little bits of bacon.
3563 2018-11-11 23:34:34 what’s a good and affordable CBD oil brand?
3564 2018-11-11 23:34:26 Oil, salt, and animal products (I.e mostly just terrified of dairy, it’s so gross.... it smells weird)
3565 2018-11-11 23:34:08 It probably has something to do with all of the money politicians have gladly accepted from big oil for GENERATIONS... allowing big oil to essentially buy their way into the government..
3566 2018-11-11 23:33:47 Yeah, research palm oil and one of the top companies that come up is Unilever who’s the parent company of Dove
3567 2018-11-11 23:33:42 need an oil plug asap

3572 2018-11-11 23:32:53 That's a good cause more people should know about. Stop buying items with palm oil in it. Palm trees are cut down further depleting these beautiful creatures homes and making them easier to catch by poachers.

3576 2018-11-11 23:32:12 At least nobody is going to try and flog the snake oil that it’s more readable.
3577 2018-11-11 23:32:01 Now that the saudis apologized to trump for Khashoggi by lowering WTI they are now looking at their wallets and now is time to bring it back up.  Classic oil
3578 2018-11-11 23:31:59 My check engine light came on today and I hope to god it’s just for an oil change
3579 2018-11-11 23:31:57 omg so many people got offended when i said people who r white and say “i’m italian” are the mayonnaise w olive oil in it lol

3581 2018-11-11 23:31:29 It’s comical how they tout not testing on animals, but remain silent about the fact that they destroy the homes of orangutans yearly just to obtail palm oil, which they use in all their products. One hand ain’t washing the other w/their ivory bars, bruh.

3583 2018-11-11 23:30:56 Is it good to wash your face with a 2nd/different cleanser after using an oil cleanser to take make up off?
3584 2018-11-11 23:30:51 The only thing that keeps my skin moisturized is olive oil, that’s how dry  this weather is. Y’all stay moisturized out here 
3585 2018-11-11 23:30:51 you may want to find a good quality peanut oil, has a higher smoke point
3586 2018-11-11 23:30:48 BOO USE ÁRGAN OIL ONE N ONLY FROM SALLYS IN MIDNIGHT BLUE THATS THE COLOR I HAVE
3587 2018-11-11 23:30:41 I eat so much Italian food I basically bleed extra Virgin olive oil and marinara sauce. Like yeah other food is cool but spaghetti really gets me. Wish my name was Tanya so it rhymed with lasagna. I want my obituary to say I pastaway.

3589 2018-11-11 23:30:39 Mine's decided that I needed to eat way less sugar, way less fat and oil and grease, way less sodium, and preferable few dairy products.

My (mostly female) doctors and nurses are jealous, while I'd cheerfully like to feed them a piece of my mind about loss of autonomy.
3590 2018-11-11 23:30:34 PBR have shown great relative strength compared to the sector, and if OIL gets a bid I suspect the stock will focking RIP.
3591 2018-11-11 23:30:31 @chefsymon I’m debating whether or not to deep fry a turkey.  My wife has a peanut allergy.  What’s a good alternative oil to use?
3592 2018-11-11 23:30:29 Definitely healthier & not so stinky (so long as one is educated about dosage, otherwise edibles are biggest cause of weed emergency room visits).  Most medicinal benefits are in the CBDs (which aren't psychoactive), just a drop of oil on back of tongue - but many LIKE THC high.
3593 2018-11-11 23:30:28 Ex Rain forest palm oil.

3597 2018-11-11 23:30:07 afaik contract has been signed recently so not many bucks spent on us lng. we are dependent on russian gas and oil anyway. polish gov is imo most pro trump one in eu. trump will dump them on first occasion for deal with russia
3598 2018-11-11 23:29:59 Well there's another idiot who takes 'created in God's image' at face value & totally superficially!!

Don't talk to your snake oil salesman of a pastor if he (definitely not female!) has led you to that conclusion.

Speak to a real Reverend who studied theology & learn please!!
3599 2018-11-11 23:29:58 1. hada labo gokujyun cleansing oil

3600 2018-11-11 23:29:58 Okay, yeah. Ansem seems exactly like the kind of guy who has giant oil paintings of himself. #KH2
3601 2018-11-11 23:29:48 Snake Oil is exactly right Mr. Gorka. For a price.
3602 2018-11-11 23:29:47 Tocino needs a lot of oil too tho. Also, can you put your boring tocino in other dishes like pasta, empanada, lasagna etc
3603 2018-11-11 23:29:42 New found respect for women that can make tacos on the stove with oil stuff....it’s a battle man
3604 2018-11-11 23:29:26 okay but potentially dhc cleansing oil, the kose softymo cleansing oils & the balm by banila co (which if you're sensitive to mineral oil, don't buy). micellar water is also another option. for wipes I've heard good things about simple (the brand). the makeup remover cloth is ok
3605 2018-11-11 23:29:17 I'm so cold. I have cleaned the back porch, kitchen, boys room, and bathroom. I've done 6 loads if laundry and 4 more to go. Beans in the crockpot, dinner planned. I've gone out and put coolant and oil in the car. Took out trash and took the cans out. Its 29 degrees burrrr
3606 2018-11-11 23:29:16 My kids have always been pretty good about them.  I roast many of my vegetables and I think that helps.  Green beans roasted in the oven with lots of olive oil and salt are like french fries.  I also grill vegetables like asparagus and zucchini and they are so delicious that way.
3607 2018-11-11 23:29:09 Burning the midnight oil tonight folks
3608 2018-11-11 23:28:52 And then a Cold War and a nuclear arms race and Vietnam/Cambodia/Laos/Korea and Israel and Pakistan and terrorism and Afghanistan... Its all one war. Just a continuation of 2500years of European wars of world domination. Now on acid due to...oil. Who will survive the next spurt?
3609 2018-11-11 23:28:50 Why is Patagonia throwing its weight behind Tester different from an oil company endorsing/funding a pro-pipeline candidate?

I worry you're giving their agenda a pass just because you happen to like their politics, which is damn shaky ethical ground.

3615 2018-11-11 23:27:39 Ever since 2011, when speculation in crude oil really started to ramp up, fundamentals have always played a second fiddle to market positioning. Remember this when you start to read all the news coming out about the recent price action... #oott
3616 2018-11-11 23:27:37 Interesting article in the Independent around Britain not wanting to back a possible EU ban on palm oil in biofuel as it could affect the possibility of weapon sales to Malaysia. Follow the money!

3620 2018-11-11 23:27:08 Right now, a used short range EV for commuting is practically free. It will cost less than $10K and it will save you around $10K in gasoline costs & oil changes over it's lifetime. (Electricity is a really cheap driving fuel.)
3621 2018-11-11 23:27:05 #PatriotAct on @netflix with @hasanminhaj is great! The new "Oil" ep today is informative and heartbreaking. And the Gipper joke that went over your audience's head...gold! His humor is intelligent and refreshing. Netflix needed a series like. And fuck #TheBodyguard lol
3622 2018-11-11 23:27:00 I think we know why. They are in cahoots for world domination. Creating a corporate oligarchy. Want to own the oil and split up the goods. 45’s entire cabinet are American oligarchs. Stealing from the poor to enrich themselves
3623 2018-11-11 23:26:56 i need new music like a pornstar needs oil 
3624 2018-11-11 23:26:38 Yes! Only the ignorant think these fires stem from mismanaged forests instead of our extreme climate crisis. No one’s talking about how California is suing Trump’s EPA to maintain their strict climate regulations that Trump’s trying to dismantle in favor of big (oil) business
3625 2018-11-11 23:26:30 Boycotts should be reserved for corporations that are actually hurting people &/or the planet.  Like Big Oil, Coal, Nestle, Disney, etc.

Not because you are mad about The Doctor being a woman or whatever silly thing they're on about this week.
3626 2018-11-11 23:26:16 Who poured palm oil on your face
3627 2018-11-11 23:26:13 I think pot and oil are about 5 and 6 on PMJT's list of priorities. Do you think May could have done better than him at 1-4? I don't.
3628 2018-11-11 23:26:08 For a pork fritter, though, nothing beats using lard or bacon grease.  

But if you only want to use oil, i woul recommend using extra light olive oil or even peanut oil instead
3629 2018-11-11 23:26:04 Peanut & canola oil have relatively higher smoke points than blends or olive oil & are more suitable to frying at higher temperatures
3630 2018-11-11 23:25:58 Perhaps try using coconut oil in and around the eye! I've used this with my cat along with eye drops from the vet with great results. The oil is anti- viral, bacterial , fungal!
3631 2018-11-11 23:25:56 I need my back massage with come coconut oil

3635 2018-11-11 23:25:46 I also fear palm oil is often used as a 'magic' ingredient in the UK, I picked up a product which had a 1 week self life and palm oil was an ingredient  in a 'sugar dusting'.
3636 2018-11-11 23:25:38 She use sabroso oil
3637 2018-11-11 23:25:37 Funny how you can't see through this traitor not following through on his oath as a senator to protect the constitution and his constituents. Instead your ok with him acting treasonous due to him taking Russian oil money. Trust all of this will be coming out soon.
3638 2018-11-11 23:25:31 OPEC is likely to agree to an oil production cut when it meets next month in Vienna as oil prices enter bear market territory and signs of oversupply loom. Saudi Arabia confirmed that it would cut its own oil supplies next month and Russia signaled that it could follow suit.
3639 2018-11-11 23:25:24 And proceeded to emulsion the ceiling ?

3640 2018-11-11 23:25:16 Need an oil or something for my beard 
3641 2018-11-11 23:25:07 You gotta be joking.

3646 2018-11-11 23:24:32 PrediMed compared Med diet + olive or + nuts vs. low-fat.  So ~ 25% RRR includes dietary *pattern* eff. Yes olive oil may act via multiple mechanisms. I like the point abt comparing effect size of (costly) meds vs. TLC. Brings back 1 of my fav debates, polypill vs polymeal : -)
3647 2018-11-11 23:24:20 At the same time, I have a yard full of leave that need raking, need an oil change, and my car could stand to be washed, so he’s welcome to pay off his community service over here.
3648 2018-11-11 23:24:04 It is correct for Govt of India to buy and store crude oil We need to build large storage facility like one we have on west coast .It is time private sector is given incentive to build storage facility in any part of India.With extensive pipeline network of GAIL should be used.
3649 2018-11-11 23:24:04 what oil were you using?
3650 2018-11-11 23:23:42 in today’s edition of Tessa Why: dropped my phone INSIDE the stair stepper at the gym and the hot manager had to spend forty minutes helping me get it out

this story sounds like a meet-cute. it was not. it ended with mechanical oil everywhere and a now broken stair stepper
3651 2018-11-11 23:23:42 How about you start incentivizing clean energy and stop jacking off bug oil
3652 2018-11-11 23:23:40 Flavor can be a thing even with vegetarian stuff. So many vegetarians don’t know this...I always got so frustrated being a vegetarian at events and their veg option was bloated pasta with crunchy vegetables and olive oil or some shit.
3653 2018-11-11 23:23:03 Dollar up, oil up, futures down.  Haha. Makes zero sense.  See how we look in the am
3654 2018-11-11 23:22:47 So TG-rich lipoproteins (including remnants) decrease more than LDL-c goes up. I wonder if they have plasma to measure LPL activity (it would be interesting even if non-heparinized). Also, has anyone studied effect of fish oil on VLDL and chylomicron remnant receptors?
3655 2018-11-11 23:22:47 Just watched. This oil spill has been going on since my daughter was born. She’s now a freshman in high school.
3656 2018-11-11 23:22:31 Am I the only one that thinks that CBD oil don’t work 
3657 2018-11-11 23:22:26 #makedataaffordable You subscribe to a 3-month data subscription, they say they've given you a huge amount of data bonus. In a matter of mins, bonus and half data is gone. They're now like making water as scarce as crude oil. They think their networks are inevitable.
3658 2018-11-11 23:22:17 Made some tendies and forgot to oil the cookie sheet, if you need me I'll be in my room listening to Ariana grande and eating half breaded chicken strips
3659 2018-11-11 23:22:12 This is even better.... he’s never seen the colts play at Lucas oil.
3660 2018-11-11 23:22:07 Beto has the IT factor. If he was a to the center on 1 or 2 issues, he might have won. Cruz is big supporter of oil and gas, which employs a lot of Texans, so it’s amazing that Beto did so well. Not sure the DNC would get behind Beto though.
3661 2018-11-11 23:22:05 How can mayonnaise be so good when it’s just like... chicken embryos and oil
3662 2018-11-11 23:21:53 The crude oil prices have fallen by 20% in last 30 days and it is expected that it may fall further in supply is not reduced. OPEC needs to take quick action to reduce the supply.But till then expect petrol and diesel prices to fall .
3663 2018-11-11 23:21:48 Plus thank God that I'm pretty sure that you will die before our oil runs up
3664 2018-11-11 23:21:34 Does anybody else’s dad get irritated when you tell them somethings wrong with your car ? My dads like:  “Girl, I told your ass about playing around with that damn car!” “You been checking that oil?!” but, ends up fixing it anyways lollollol

3669 2018-11-11 23:21:13 Splashing baby oil on! And putting lemon in our hair
3670 2018-11-11 23:21:05 So it is "fake news" that we have the lowest unemployment in decades? Millions of jobs created? The highest GDP in years, a booming economy, a solid stock market, soon to be lower oil prices... he is just making that stuff up eh?
3671 2018-11-11 23:21:04 The flip does shed some light on the issue. Given the fact that “fish oil” is cardio protective, and will contribute to RRR, is Vascepa the right answer or  generic supplemental food intake of EPA the right answer. JELIS offers that answe. Eat more fish! 2/
3672 2018-11-11 23:21:02 At current oil prices need to use % rather than $/bbl for dramatic headlines.
3673 2018-11-11 23:20:57 You mean like burning 93 million barrels of oil and 9 million tonnes of coal each and every day?
3674 2018-11-11 23:20:56 $OIL is in focus this week. After it’s largest losing streak in 35 years I would be looking for some support around the $60 level. Will be looking to long CAD crosses
3675 2018-11-11 23:20:45 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
3676 2018-11-11 23:20:42 Simple fix. We put thinner oil in the hydraulics. Never had any issues
3677 2018-11-11 23:20:35 Ah.  That might be the issue.  Canola oil has a relatively low smoke point.  What are you cooking and how much oil do you have in there?

3680 2018-11-11 23:20:17 Watching and sharing the Iceland banned Christmas advert isn’t going to stop companies using palm oil. YOU need to stop buying products, sign petitions and do your research. Watching a 2 minuet video isn’t going to stop what’s happening, WE ALL need to act on what we’ve seen

3684 2018-11-11 23:19:44 OK, I agree, so let's call it Loopholes capitalism then. Whatever you call it, what's at stake is the future of life (as we know it) on this rather small planet, a jewel in space we are destroying with plastic lobies (oil). Sure, micro-organism will survive in deep oceans, but...
3685 2018-11-11 23:19:36 @GordonRamsay I keep trying to make omelets in a cast iron pan, but no matter what I try (olive oil, butter, less eggs, etc.) The eggs still stick to the pan and ruin it. How do I keep this from happening?

3696 2018-11-11 23:17:44 Not to worry Hasan. We will run out of a liveable environment long before we hit the bottom of the oil tank. I like your thinking though.
3697 2018-11-11 23:17:31 Oh em gee. Perfect job for me in 4 years when I retire from the oil and gas crazy zone.  Wish it were now. Would love to work for you. Will prolly volunteer at camp hope when I retire. That’s the current plan, as long as we are healthy.
3698 2018-11-11 23:17:23 for R&B you just apply It after like putting in a leave in & go or do you like seal everything in with a oil or something?
3699 2018-11-11 23:17:19 @jaimelawson08 Thanks for such a great product. I suffer from occasional migraines and retinal migraines which don't often go with normal medication. 3 drops of the oil and they disappear within 10 minutes. I've also found it amazing for pain relief and sleep 
3700 2018-11-11 23:17:15 I definitely needed my oil changed. and i JUST left lafayette where i get it done free
3701 2018-11-11 23:16:58 Seems like after tonights events a full ground war in Gaza is on the brink. The world sits and observes silently. The Arab states dwell in their oil and billions of dollars as their brothers and sisters die mercilessly. What will it take for everyone to wake up? #GazaUnderAttack

3706 2018-11-11 23:16:28 For the record, in 1914 Texas, Azerbaijan, and California were the global leaders in oil production and Mexico was thought to have the greatest potential reserves
3707 2018-11-11 23:16:24 We'd recommend bringing a few bottles of Gatorade. Bow comes across as the type who is ready to burn the midnight oil and you'll need to refuel
3708 2018-11-11 23:16:21 I love them but this particular pkg seems to cook funny.  they don't soften in the oil and they cook oddly, so I keep ending up with crunchy, overcooked hb's.  *shrug*
3709 2018-11-11 23:16:20 $STO : Oil futures up almost 2% likely on OPEC production cut concerns following the weekend meeting. Good base forming in Santos currently on a green light despite Friday nights market movement.
3710 2018-11-11 23:15:31 The article is based on propaganda and fake economics. Just ask yourself, why are poorly paid scientists being blamed for getting thousands in research grants while oil companies and Koch brothers make billions off ignoring the irrefutable CO2 science established in the 1800s?
3711 2018-11-11 23:15:30 Best reason for going full force in renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro), making nuclear safer, and creating a bridge with natural gas thus eliminating our need and dependence on oil. Drive oil below $10 a barrel.
3712 2018-11-11 23:15:29 Then why isn't the criminal Mikhail Khodorkovsky still in Russia after ripping the Russian people off of Yukos oil & was caught trying to illegally sell it off to western elite? Putin offered criminal oligarchs the chance to play it straight & quit ripping off Russia and yet???

3728 2018-11-11 23:14:24 How hot is the oil when you start frying?  And what kind of oil are you using?
3729 2018-11-11 23:14:18 If the author had done research they would’ve known that British interest in Iraq was because they feared a German sub base in Basra that would threaten India

Great to see that current affairs’ understanding of the Middle East remains as shallow as “look, oil!”
3730 2018-11-11 23:14:16 Being off work tomorrow means burning the midnight oil on these life changes. Looking forward to it.

3732 2018-11-11 23:13:48 Everyone should download the free app called palm oil. You can scan your barcodes and it will tell you if the product had palm oil and if it is responsibly sourced.
3733 2018-11-11 23:13:35 I am not an expert in oil drilling, as Bones would say, I am just a simple country doc, but I thought the developments are like medical developments? Something that a few years ago seemed impossible is now possible?
3734 2018-11-11 23:13:26 Walking around Costco with goat cheese in olive oil & truffle bits (to eat with cheezits later) in one hand and Christmas lights in the other. Also sold a bunch of pocket watches & wedding rings in Red Dead this morning. My grown up life.

3739 2018-11-11 23:13:05 Logically, either the economy really bad (Overestimate) or simply the weakness in oil is overdone.

3748 2018-11-11 23:12:12 Indelible childhood memories of roadside stands selling bags of them right next to the shitty 55 gallon oil drums they were boiled in. You could smell the stench as you drove up. I’m sure I still have tetanus and rabies.

3750 2018-11-11 23:12:01 Great on the cruelty free @dove but when are you (or your brand owners) going to come up with something other than palm oil in your products? Surely we can’t keep destroying forests to make toiletries?!
3751 2018-11-11 23:11:54 The problem with Oil is there's  just too much of the stuff, the world economy is slowing down, and oversupply looms.  Down the road quite a ways, we will have the opposite problem as the production of fracked oil is unsupported by low prices.
3752 2018-11-11 23:11:53 Pour moi tout va bien (et je ne me sens pas particulièrement privilégié) De racket j'ai l'impression de gagner plus d'argent. La hausse du gaz oil je m'en fous. Il y a 40 ans avec une heure de travail au smic on pouvait s'acheter 3 litres d'essence, aujourd'hui 6.
3753 2018-11-11 23:11:44 Oh god the point about oil makes it clear that the author read Wikipedia and nothing else for this story

No oil was discovered in Iraq prior to WW1. There were companies looking for it, but none found it. Oil wasn’t discovered until 1925 (in territory earmarked for Russia btw)
3754 2018-11-11 23:11:41 응?
3755 2018-11-11 23:11:20 who in your OTP spreads the baby oil on the floor to bait people into slipping on it and who is their victim who is so enraged at being insulted by them that they cant help but fall on the baby oil
3756 2018-11-11 23:11:06 oh my god i think i put too much oil to fry eggs felipe i can't do this

3758 2018-11-11 23:10:40 Straw man fallacy; the materials used for renewables are limited.

Perhaps oil companies want a piece of the massive subsidy cake.

Who claimed anyone wants the Bight to be an oil slick?
3759 2018-11-11 23:10:39 No Sir.
It's as it has always been. As old wells diminished, new ones are discovered. There are more new discoveries than diminishing ones.

Feel free to see UK oil and gas extraction rates for the past 10 years.

Also, extraction costs at less than a quarter that of 2014.

3770 2018-11-11 23:09:11 This just convinced me to change my soap recipe so exclude palm oil.

3772 2018-11-11 23:08:36 The week kicks off with traders closely watching whether oil will dig deeper into a bear market or rebound after the OPEC meeting.
3773 2018-11-11 23:08:33 Totally agree that a planned, and just transition is required. It's a pity the @NZNationalParty spent 9 years doing the opposite. Luckily there are many more jobs in clean energy than there are in oil and gas. #MakeOilHistory

3775 2018-11-11 23:08:15 OPEC and its allies started laying the groundwork to cut oil supply in 2019, reversing an almost year-long expansion, with Saudi Arabia reasserting its role as swing producer by announcing fewer shipments from next month @Business

3780 2018-11-11 23:07:40 I will look at that paper. But question still begs. 1400 years ago it was same then , what was driving that? And yes I am pro oil and gas. Unashamedly. You may notice we don’t hide our sponsors for research. Can I ask, do you use gas to heat your home or drive your car?

3782 2018-11-11 23:07:29 <living bottle of olive oil
3783 2018-11-11 23:07:28 Christmas Eve fondu (cheese, then meat and stuffed mushrooms in hot oil, then white chocolate fondu). Takes a long time but it’s great for spending quality time with family.
3784 2018-11-11 23:07:21 Basically anything my dude. Add some Olive oil, a little salt and pepper.
3785 2018-11-11 23:07:15 i’m truuuly working on it and i think i found just the guy. i’m only waiting on him to come back from the good old oil fields 
3786 2018-11-11 23:07:09 That article is absolutely amazing. Not ONE oil minister was ready to commit. Everyone hedged their statements to the maximum extent allowed on the border of absurdity. And yet, that headline.

3790 2018-11-11 23:06:14 Nigga don’t even know how to check the oil in his car, but wanna check my phone
3791 2018-11-11 23:06:02 Some fool really threw an oil filter at me at work
3792 2018-11-11 23:06:00 Jim must talking about the millions of innocents around the globe the US freed from the hardships of life by murdering them for oil. My Lai where they raped, tortured & scalped an unarmed village was nice. America has a surveillancestate & slave prisons, but no freedom dickhead.
3793 2018-11-11 23:05:53 $AVL resource is 47% bigger than $TMT. We have done about 300% more drilling of our resource than TMT... we know our resource better than TMT knows theirs. TMT didnt even have a circuit design in their PFS lol... will that be oil or gas sir? 
3794 2018-11-11 23:05:51 YO NUTELLA, GALAXY, CADBURY, PRINGLES U FUCKIN NAME IT ARE ALL LIKE 30% PALM FAT (PALM OIL) I’m done bye
3795 2018-11-11 23:05:42 Please give 2020 a rest for a bit

Flint still has poison water

California is burning down

Oil/gas companies still get more $ and other support than all renewables put together

Most of the country is gerrymandered beyond belief

Ballot Boxes must be secured/audible
3796 2018-11-11 23:05:22 And it’s an issue where ethical considerations increasingly take a back seat. Now it’s mostly about oil and power. No wealth or power to be had by intervening in Rwanda.
3797 2018-11-11 23:05:15 Price of oil dropping.   I think eventually could get down to $2.00/gallon...or even under

3803 2018-11-11 23:04:26 GreenPeace *is* campaigning against others using oil whilst it continues to rely on the stuff.

Do you not have the mental acuity to understand their #GreenHypocrisy ?

3808 2018-11-11 23:03:45 I would imagine it's the palm oil producers, beef farmers and any other industry responsible for the decamation of the rain forests who don't want anyone interfering with their bottom line  
3809 2018-11-11 23:03:41 surprised $ES_F did not gap up w oil on OPEC given $XLE will be gapping
3810 2018-11-11 23:03:32 @CadburyUK please tell me you’re acting on the palm oil issue? I don’t know how I’ll live the rest of my life without Cadbury but you’ve got to stop using palm fat in your choc!
3811 2018-11-11 23:03:08 What do u expect to come out, crude oil?
3812 2018-11-11 23:02:58 There's a movie on #FX tonight..."Deepwater Horizon", the true story of the offshore Oil Rig Disaster. EVERYONE should watch this movie & then write your Representatives b/c the WH got rid of the REGULATIONS that came about AFTER this, so it never happens AGAIN! #EPA
3813 2018-11-11 23:02:56 Chumby got his face glued to a fly trap. 

We first rubbed coconut oil but that made him frustrated cause he likes the taste. We decided to give him a bath and use Muddy Paws Madre De Cacao soap. It was so easy!!! Not that we want him to stick his face again.

3816 2018-11-11 23:02:33 The main reason why Scotland will never be set free -
UK admitted gaining vast wealth from over 44billion barrels of oil over 40 years extracted from BRITISH TERRITORY not Scottish..... there’s the reason for the huge Indy postal vote right there.
3817 2018-11-11 23:02:26 Where is all the silent Oil Company voices? They should be screaming - LOUD! The squeaky wheel gets the grease & that’s why we are stalled! Scream for your Company, scream for your employees, scream for Canada. Wake the HELL UP!
3818 2018-11-11 23:02:16 Secretary of Interior, known in Western States as Stinky Zinke, only cares about privatizing Federal land for oil & gas exploitation. Forest management? He's glad the trees are out of the way. Trump knows zilch about National Forests.

3824 2018-11-11 23:01:15 A scientist friend from India told me that lots of oil/energy company's buy free energy patents and sit on them. Many inventors have 'disappeared' if they don't sell.

3837 2018-11-11 23:00:20 How soon are we going to be able to buy the Omega 3 snake oil? Also, will they come with cool "old-timey" labels?
3838 2018-11-11 23:00:19 You would think in this modern era parents would want what's best for their kids and believe science over quackery but the people who refuse to vaccinate their kids based off BS junk prove that believing in snake oil salesmen is still alive and well.
3839 2018-11-11 23:00:16 Most oil producers countries have decided to decrease supply to control dropping oil prices. Less oil supply and higher demand will cause oil prices to increase. – bij Terminal 1 Bus Station
3840 2018-11-11 23:00:14 If there’s ever a specific #Skyrim candle, it’d be called “doh vah kiin”

It’d probably be a combination of campfire ash, honey mead, juniper oil, and sea salt.
3841 2018-11-11 22:59:55 This is why I think the SDF is so cool, it's number one goal is the defence of Japan, because the Japanese have the US as an ally now they don't need to be aggressive (Japan's strategic pre-emptive in WW2 was only done because of the US's oil embargo)
3842 2018-11-11 22:59:41 At least it’s not (from many episodes of “Chopped”) truffle oil.
3843 2018-11-11 22:59:26 In any case oil is limited. Already oil companies are buying up plans for renewables for when the oil runs out. But not before they’ve fucked up more pristine waterways. Do you want the Bight to be an oil slick?

3847 2018-11-11 22:58:52 They’re a tangible oil medium. They’re extremely messy but for some works makes sense to use them. Like, if you have a larger piece and wanted almost colored chalk (they’re not chalk though just to be clear).
3848 2018-11-11 22:58:49 Usually castor oil or EBO beard balm now, sometimes I browse Etsy for something else good and natural
3849 2018-11-11 22:58:49 If I had any other profession and lived outside of Texas, I would probably just get my medical card or try the CBD oil.

3854 2018-11-11 22:58:18 It would seem that pouring groundnut oil on my lips would have longer lasting effects than a lot of these lip balms.

3858 2018-11-11 22:57:56 I didn’t lie. The campaign against the drilling for oil because of the threat to the waters of the Southern Ocean is quite clear. Whether or not the Greens campaign for renewables is a separate issue. Do you not have the mental acuity to understand the difference?
3859 2018-11-11 22:57:44 You may not be but many people are hungry and suffering in this country. People eat porridge without oil.we need a savior

3866 2018-11-11 22:56:55 You don't save that much money changing your own oil. It's that you can use quality oils and filters and make sure the tired guy and jiffy lube doesn't fuck your shit up.
3867 2018-11-11 22:56:54 @JPokluda At CG tonight. We have to know more about the car. 1. Why would you own a car for only two weeks? 2. Was it ruined after you sold it (no oil)? 3. How did you resolve the situation?
3868 2018-11-11 22:56:48 Love this. How can it be banned?!?
Please don’t forget much of the rainforests are being cleared for cattle pastures. 70%-80% of the clear-cutting in the Amazon is for beef farming. Palm oil is not the major problem here.
3869 2018-11-11 22:56:48 So it just mainly absorbs oil? 
This little can cost $7 so I'll definetly try both. My hair is super dry but midweek it gets noticeably unwashed. Lol.
Thanks for the tidbit.
3870 2018-11-11 22:56:41 Iiiiiiii do. So basically you just need a glass pan for the oven & u oil it GENEROUSLY & put in some ginger and garlic (onions if u like) & then cut the b sprouts in half and put em cut down. Cook 15 min @ 350° then u flip them over and cook 10-15 more. It's the best.
3871 2018-11-11 22:56:38 I'm inclined to believe the orangutan conservation organizations like OFI and Orangutan Alliance over you. They stress the need to reduce palm oil far more than any other habitat destruction contributor. Are there other organizations that agree with your assertion?
3872 2018-11-11 22:56:23 Oil is not from fossils
3873 2018-11-11 22:56:21 Lol, no, im an engineer who spent a decade in the oil industry. But there are more people than not who believe fossil fuels come from dinosaurs. You know there are lol
3874 2018-11-11 22:56:20 I hope some EU Exec brings this uo during talks. But you tell the Scottish People oil is worthless & running out, but yet here you are attempting to use future oil wealth as a bargaining chip 
3875 2018-11-11 22:56:03 Although I do my own oil changes I saved 3 people $138 on oil changes because it’s Veterans Day #ThankYouForYourService 
3876 2018-11-11 22:56:02 Just a quick thought  , is it considered cheating for football players to moisturize their bodies with either baby oil or Vaseline before a game ? 
3877 2018-11-11 22:55:54 midnight oil has been burned. Another trip to #Kubernetes land.

3880 2018-11-11 22:55:37 one time a guy started talking to me about the dog I was walking and we had a nice conversation about dogs until he suddenly mentioned that with my job it must feel great to get home and have a boyfriend rub and oil my feet
3881 2018-11-11 22:55:29 It's because they still use the oil there for  right now they contribute  to the killing they should of saved this for next year once they stopped using the oil not before but it shouldn't of been banned it's what people need to see to realise what goes on in the world.
3882 2018-11-11 22:55:24 A discussion is something that happens between people 
who know and understand a subject.
How can you have a discussion with Donny?
The only subject he Knows is Snake Oil Sales techniques.
Everything else is sound bites from someone else, like Fox News.
3883 2018-11-11 22:55:07 Could just as easily have been Sunderland Newcastle Crystal palace or Leeds my friend. They've built a hell of a setup at city but what happens when their regime gets overthrown back home, the oil runs out, or they get bored? The old City is long gone
3884 2018-11-11 22:54:55 Hmmm, could be a lot of things. Not sure if EPA, seems like dosage might been a bit too low to have any notable impact. Olive oil has some other very interesting compounds in it but I doubt they’d have serious notable meaningful effects. All those factors could interact though
3885 2018-11-11 22:54:52 keep tweeting from your bedroom.....

3889 2018-11-11 22:53:42 In Norway we pay high taxes. Our oil and fish bring us billonssss yearly. Also, 25% of the profit a company makes on EACH product goes to our state monthly.

3893 2018-11-11 22:52:53 > This goal of transparency, it seems, has not proved sufficient for “creating value”

fwiw, many people seem to be more interested in plastic toys than oil drilling.

If #opendata is the oil (raw material) in this example, what are the toys (where is the value)?
3894 2018-11-11 22:52:42 Please do your job and stop blindly repeating oil industry hyperbole and propaganda.
3895 2018-11-11 22:52:36 2) I think US citizens, even anti-immigration folk, feel for these people. They want to help but don't want to get into "open borders" territory. The only thing I can think of is their leaders are corrupt. Venezuela has oil and gold; is next to flourishing countries. Confusing
3896 2018-11-11 22:52:13 Asia Pacific markets are looking at a negative start to the trading week. A resurgent US dollar, falling oil and base metal prices and pressure on European and US stocks on Friday night will likely cruel local sentiment @MicMcCarthy_CMC

3899 2018-11-11 22:51:58 It totally is, but I typically do not.  Plus I go through a whole process to clear all oil prior to painting.  I think it’s the shitty top coat.  Like, when I paint it on even if the color coat is fully dry, it will start to lift and buckle and looks awful.

3912 2018-11-11 22:50:10 I think it might have to do with the development of new technologies that now make it possible to drill for that oil at lower costs?
3913 2018-11-11 22:50:06 The breakup of Standard Oil in 1911 is fascinating to read about. But comparing it to today’s trillion dollar corporations is scary.
3914 2018-11-11 22:50:06 I just got an email from a stock picker. Don’t buy any stock in the oil business. Oilfield, off shore rigs, drillers, nothing. Gas is down to $2.14 in Oklahoma. Oil is the biggest lagger there is. It takes 10-16 months for oil to even start to think about recovering off a bottom.
3915 2018-11-11 22:49:49 En 1902 Teddy Roosevelt demandó a los ferrocarriles y en 42 demandas adicionales a los monopolios de la carne, el azúcar, a DuPont, y la Standard Oil. Eso inició el desarrollo moderno de Estados Unidos. Aquí habrá que hacer lo mismo si queremos lograr la prosperidad general.
3916 2018-11-11 22:49:43 I don't think it is society per se, except of course if you have a penchant for sharks fin soup.  The shark fin fishers don't give a toss about anything but their wallets.  Likewise palm oil producers.  It just needs raised awareness and I think you will find things will change.
3917 2018-11-11 22:49:41 I’m only asking because the trolls are stating all negative towards Bell. I want Bell with the Steelers but if his bill is too high and don’t wanna pay it then let it go. I’m not gonna pay Midos for an oil change if the mom and pop store does the same thing at a lower rate

3933 2018-11-11 22:46:52 Bear in mind that a large part of those subsidies is to bring the costs down to the point where subsidies are not necessary, and the rest is effectively an attempt to counter a tiny fraction of the subsidies that exist to support today’s oil infrastructure.

3938 2018-11-11 22:46:34 It's always the case where someone/organisation will profit from the misfortune of others. Pleasing the shareholders or not, Iceland made a commitment not to sell products that contain palm oil. It's a positive start and it's needed.

“Think of what the UK would be like without the vast wealth generated by the 44bn barrels of oil pumped from British territory over the last 40 years.”

They consider our oil as theirs & Scotland is too poor!

Is YES yet?

3942 2018-11-11 22:46:13 That didn’t mean for the US to help European allies like France to have more influence in North Africa, take Libya’s oil and make France’s military reassert its position in the world. This is about world dominance, not world peace.
3943 2018-11-11 22:45:51 Iran is supplying weapons and logistical support to Houthi -Iran are fighting proxy wars all over the region and access to Red Sea/Gulf Of Aden is part of their strategic support to Houthi in Yemen directly affect shipping world oil - Saudi are our allies - Iran are not
3944 2018-11-11 22:45:49 Trump & Zinke are drastically reducing National Park land & selling or leasing the land to oil & gas interests.  For example, 50,000 acres of Carlesbad Cavernes was given over to FRACKING!
3945 2018-11-11 22:45:49 Yes and it is but it is seen as a Religion. There would be a worldwide outcry if any one country tried to ban a 'religion' such as this one. It is powerful & we would be hit with all sorts of bans, maybe terrorist attacks as well. Our trade would suffer, oil could be cut off etc.
3946 2018-11-11 22:45:40 Rise early. Work hard. Strike oil.
3947 2018-11-11 22:45:34 Presumably it's more difficult for them to steal Yemeni oil now that the world is aware of the true aims of their war against Yemen, leading to the world's worst man made humanitarian catastrophe, which is still ongoing, leaving behind an ugly scar on the conscience of humanity

3981 2018-11-11 22:40:53 I'm glad the ad was made. I'm glad it's got the publicity it deserves. Now can we have a conversation about palm oil, it's uses, it's benefits and how if we need it can we grow it ethically.

Further, with oil @ $120=fracking gone wild=greater supply=exporting bonanza

3995 2018-11-11 22:39:11 That 'banned' Iceland advert is an interesting case. On the one hand, I'm broadly supportive of the message that palm oil is another way in which corporations extort labour and the environment in order to profit.

On the other hand, I'm not going to fucking bat for Iceland.

4017 2018-11-11 22:36:10 Or do you mean US/European countries starting wars in the Middle East so they can fight for the oil they desperately want? You should see what happened to Gaddafi’s 143 tons of gold/oil. I don’t think it’s just going to sit there without being touched.

4048 2018-11-11 22:32:27 “For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord sends rain on the land.’”—1 Kgs 17,14
4049 2018-11-11 22:32:14 So they also extract baby oil from babies?
4050 2018-11-11 22:32:06 I regularly use this Palm Oil shopping app from @CheyenneMtnZoo Does the UK have anything similar?
4051 2018-11-11 22:31:59 i remember heating oil + garlic and soaking a cotton pad in it to hold against my ear for soothing the infected area,, it might work
4052 2018-11-11 22:31:43 Ok, I need to finish my paper, but my son wants me in for the trivia night championships... how can I say no?!    midnight oil required?! #singlemomlife #hastobedone
4053 2018-11-11 22:31:36 They extract olive oil from the stones, not the olives themselves....
4054 2018-11-11 22:31:36 2236 I pray your oil never run out in serving the King btw lecrae is taken 
4055 2018-11-11 22:31:31 That is one busy plate! Or is it a bowl? Also hoping the sauces are basalmic vinegar and olive oil based. And not gravy. 
4056 2018-11-11 22:31:19 I'll buy you coconut oil babe /.\ don't worry
4057 2018-11-11 22:31:02 Anything more than you want to add is welcome. I get they worship Lucifer and the child/human trafficking pedovore stuff.  But the theory of us being a "people farm" is new. Some post on oil being "anything that used to be alive" and the Facebook post made me see more.
4058 2018-11-11 22:30:58 We dont do corner flag BS and our clubs big enough to handle our order sizes without pumping in oil money.

We just play shite looking football and put oursleves in situations where we're not happy but cant be too dissapointed.
4059 2018-11-11 22:30:55 United fans making “oil money” and “dirty” excuses for today need to man up. We’ve finished above you for the past 8 years and ran you into the ground today. Grow a pair and admit you deserved to lose today, and deserve to be 12 points behind us 12 games in.
4060 2018-11-11 22:30:46 I hate when people say something like an edible or oil don’t make them high like that shit ain’t science lmao

4065 2018-11-11 22:29:47 Somewhere inside that snake oil salesman wrapper, there's a scared and hurting little boy who needs prayer just like the rest of us -- which doesn't mean that he should be given the power to run rampant.  He needs to be restrained until at least as long as it takes to oust him...
4066 2018-11-11 22:29:33 Not my fault if their social media team misread my original tweet. I was in no way soliciting them specifically. I already knew a place that was gonna do it. I guess Tony gets a free oil change now too

4068 2018-11-11 22:29:11 So I changed the pumpkin muffin recipe, going against all the recipes with their excessive amounts of oil, only used 1 tsp of peanut oil because I was out of coconut oil. You gotta let the pumpkin speak for itself otherwise they taste like banana muffins. I’m not even joking.
4069 2018-11-11 22:29:09 Thanks Elon. As a scientist I am really worried about declining public trust in science. I think it boils down to inadequate emphasis on critical thinking in school, this is how people come to believe big oil propaganda over rigorous science.
4070 2018-11-11 22:28:52 @jimcramer I like VLO. Had been buying on dips thru September/October. I was approaching my target position amt when VLO merged with AE, LLP. Valero suck on that news. With the price of oil going lower; VLO is freefall tanking. I still really like VLO fundamentals. Hold/Sell?
4071 2018-11-11 22:28:38 Heading towards NoDeal and the feckers have already sold our fisheries, farmers and now wanna squeeze the oil n gas for some asshat deal. Time we sent Merkle, Macron and EU Commission our plans for Independence!

4073 2018-11-11 22:28:24 Hey Doc, just a heads-up that I may be asking for the laymens version of your tweets.  I have a cabinet full of fish oil tablets but when I read that a study declared them useless I stopped taking them.
4074 2018-11-11 22:28:21 As long as you aren’t in the press, oppose oil pipelines or brown or black. You might want to think through your statement...
4075 2018-11-11 22:28:16 Most peanut butters contain an oil to make it spreadable…
4076 2018-11-11 22:28:06 It’s a mix of a very detailed graphite drawing, real watercolor textures that I make and scan in and digital oil. Some of the textures in the book are from real rock in Yellowstone.
4077 2018-11-11 22:28:03 I’ve seen my local upscale market quit carrying their house brand of “Italian EVOO” so someone must’ve told them it was North African cheap olive oil. 
4078 2018-11-11 22:28:03 Good old gun oil. Should have just used spit
4079 2018-11-11 22:27:47 Pareciera que el "deal" que tenían los árabes con Trump de precios bajos del oil vs silencio por tema Khashoggi era hasta las midterms, ahora a tratar de recuperar terreno. Que esperas en el corto plazo respecto a precios, Alberto?
4080 2018-11-11 22:27:29 do you keep your head in the ass? how much did the oil prices grow and how much did the pensions and salaries grow? did pensions dropped $20 again when oil prices dropped in the 2015-2016? no. so *beep* off
4081 2018-11-11 22:27:23 I have obsessed over this as invested with AMRN    Insane outcomes!  Challenge will be whether mineral oil as placebo affected outcomes.    The placebo group saw increased LDL/CRP on statin.  Raising concerns that the mineral oil affected the statin absoption.
4082 2018-11-11 22:27:19 @HannahHindi sending blessings of olive oil, rosemary, spearmint, & eucalyptus keeps u looking like ur photo still, sending blessings lol

4084 2018-11-11 22:27:01 @dominos Why do you always add the garlic oil to the crust, when I specifically ask for none?  Happens every time.
4085 2018-11-11 22:26:59 Yeh but Congress recieves cartels payments to stay out of country ? Meanwhile we travel 10000 miles to stick our nose in others business! Oil@business
4086 2018-11-11 22:26:38 “No man is an island floating in Pomegranate Noir bath oil while listening to Oprah’s SuperSoul.” Excellent article on self-care in this weeks Sunday Times @dollyalderton 
4087 2018-11-11 22:26:36 I have spoken with quite a few who saw combat action and are critical of the fact that innocent people are being harmed for oil and other resources. Most say they didn't know of the lies until they saw for themselves.
4088 2018-11-11 22:26:08 Third time changing my own car oil and it’s definitely fulfilling. I would never go full board mechanic but this is something so simple that everyone should do at least once in their life. 
4089 2018-11-11 22:26:05 Happy Monday! Talking oil, shopping, and airlines (naturally) this morning. Looking forward to chatting with @Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, and @LazadaSG CEO Alexis Lanternier in the 8am SG/HK hour. Hope you'll join us @CNBCi
4090 2018-11-11 22:26:03 Does anyone know if CLA oil break a fast? #IntermittentFasting
4091 2018-11-11 22:25:17 Science vs oil companies?
Are you serious?
I bet 1 BTC you are joking.
4092 2018-11-11 22:25:16 Calling someone a commie like thats supposed to be an insult. At least I'm not so naive to assume the war in iraq was fought over freedom and not regime change to set up a western friendly puppet state that would sell us cheap oil.
4093 2018-11-11 22:25:09 Uhh, it’s a really big ship that needs lots of lubrication to run correctly... I’ll grad the tanning oil... (said in Bruce’s impersonation voice)
4094 2018-11-11 22:25:07 Oil ministers warned that the gap between supply and demand could widen next year, which “may require new strategies to balance the market.”
4095 2018-11-11 22:25:07 HAHAHA 

Nice toss with that whale oil tank 

And of course I'm proud of you, I'm always proud every time you cause a bloodbath

4100 2018-11-11 22:24:34 tater tots baked with olive oil and garlic powder.  the best.
4101 2018-11-11 22:24:14 If subsidies are only "direct" then the oil industry probably has no subsidies. I would suspect a large share of subsidies are "indirect" (e.g., you don't have to pay what others have to pay).
4102 2018-11-11 22:24:12 Sounds good, want to come to mine oil up and start a wrestling club?
4103 2018-11-11 22:24:05 A big market for your companies, influence, locations for your military bases and access to the Middle East for controlling the oil. We do not much care if you leave and stay on your side of the Atlantic. Finally.
4104 2018-11-11 22:24:05 In other words, If we can get more money for oil we can do it. PDVSA does not have the capabilities right now. VZ is annexed by Cuba and while two tankers arrived in Havana yesterday, there’s no gasoline in VZ today.
4105 2018-11-11 22:23:48 I profited immensely from “it.” So did you. So did everyone. Our entire lifestyle and civilization is based on inexpensive energy from fossil fuels.

But if it’s both “big oil” and the government, why are you only mad at “big oil”?
4106 2018-11-11 22:23:47 Well, it’s not only the lamp, but the oil. The foolish apparently had oil in their lamps until about midnight, since at that point their lamps were going out. Why do you think they didn’t bring “extra” oil? What do you think think this action communicates about their beliefs?
4107 2018-11-11 22:23:41 Attention POTUS personal assistant or FLOTUS please put a shower cap in your Bosom whenever you travel with POTUS that will solve all potential rain problems- No one knows better than FLOTUS that POTUS will look like a wet rat coming out of oil if his hair should ever get wet
4108 2018-11-11 22:23:24 Take an old mascara wand and dip it in coconut oil or Jamaican black castor oil and lightly apply it to your lashes. They’ll grow back thicker and longer in a couple weeks
4109 2018-11-11 22:23:18 Yeah I knew that that was part of the problem as the oil is flammable. I guess no one warned them about Australia brush fires.
4110 2018-11-11 22:23:17 Got oatmeal and organic virgin coconut oil by kirkland signature +2 foods for breakfast: 336cals, 16g fat, 45g carbs, 6g protein.

4115 2018-11-11 22:22:33 Just did a DIY shellac manicure removal using acetone, cuticle oil and a nail file and I can safely say it would’ve been easier to saw my own hands OFF
4116 2018-11-11 22:22:30 Good luck with that..
4117 2018-11-11 22:22:22 Yes Nigeria is an oil rich.

4119 2018-11-11 22:22:10 Edibles, lotions, vape. Have you tried just cbd oil? DM me if you want.
4120 2018-11-11 22:22:01 6 times growth for a veeery short period of time. and my mom's pension grew 20 times. see the difference? it's not about oil prices. and then the prices dropped in 2015-16 to the 90's numbers the pensions stayed the same. that's how Putin works, byotch.
4121 2018-11-11 22:21:51 So true. Racism is deeper than an oil rig and more devisive than an ocean.
4122 2018-11-11 22:21:48 A lot of people thought he’d become a 30G guy. Think he still has it in him, but he’ll more or less be a 20G guy as long as his developmental needs are addressed. Can play with either 29/97 imo, but anyone with 97 gets a boost. Some guys instantly adjust, some take time.
4123 2018-11-11 22:21:48 Al Gore is a snake oil charlatan and should be chased out of town. He's into this scam so deep he hasn't a way out. CO2 is a good trace gas we would all die without.
4124 2018-11-11 22:21:38 Will now stop eating @Tesco meal deals (cry) after realising how many of the products, including sandwiches, have palm oil in.

4127 2018-11-11 22:21:36 Hahahaha! Maybe he has finally deported himself to south south so as to benefit from Oil money.
4128 2018-11-11 22:21:20 Oil now approaching 20% down. If Gold spikes above $1240 - have to go defensive everything. However this is NOT expected.
Cautiously optimistic that our market (XJO) will hold above 5810 this week.
Asian markets continue to be a concern.

4132 2018-11-11 22:21:06 Indians still complaining as long as they pay the equivalent of $0.25.  Trust me.  I am Pakistani and the Indian is the biggest cry baby on earth when it comes to money - anything from their pocket to you is "too much" so wisely, I see you're ignoring their noise. #OOTT
4133 2018-11-11 22:21:05 #Hawaii Fact: The Kukui (Candlenut) Tree is Hawaii's state tree. Ancient Hawaiians burned the Kukui nut's oil to provide light.
4134 2018-11-11 22:20:41 You do know that the vast majority of these areas had the same issue of gas in water long before fracking or even oil drilling, right? Don't tell me you're that ignorant
4135 2018-11-11 22:20:39 Yeh when they win another 32 trophies. Without oil money.
4136 2018-11-11 22:20:39 Yes Nigeria is oil rich,
4137 2018-11-11 22:20:25 Oil in the soil; coal in the hole . . . #RenewablesNow
4138 2018-11-11 22:20:23 I see what you are saying although the articles are still misleading to me. Agreed the meal is fed to cattle but the oil is mostly for humans. Not a by-product but a joint product. one of these 2-fer crops that the companies make a ton of $ from, but not for a single purpose.
4139 2018-11-11 22:20:19 WWF is a registered charity. Greeneoeace is allowed air time during elections. WWF on the other hand could run an ad about palm oil & habitats. You need to be grown up & get your facts right if you value your credibility. I thought it was a great ad & agree with the message.
4140 2018-11-11 22:20:14 They had oil in their lamps, though—since they were going out around midnight. Why do you think they wouldn’t bring “extra”?
4141 2018-11-11 22:20:07 I'm gonna fry potatoes in peanut oil and get fat, because it's cheap calories and tastes goo.
4142 2018-11-11 22:20:01 Like trying to mix oil and water...
4143 2018-11-11 22:19:43 I am wondering what ‘banned for being too political’ could mean? Maybe that too many politicians get too much money from the palm oil industry to ignore murder? 
4144 2018-11-11 22:19:38 Don't you have a "finish above .500 " banner to hang at Lucas Oil field or something.

4149 2018-11-11 22:18:36 are to most people and think that you and yours will somehow levitate above temptation? The world is a very different place to your childhood in the 80s - no man can swim in oil without becoming slick even if he does not ingest it.
4150 2018-11-11 22:18:30 The last season of House of Cards is like one of those “oil paintings” that an adversarial AI produces when it’s been given 20000 mediocre portraits as training data. Sort of kinda like a painting but obviously not. I’ve never seen anything less coherent in my life. Awful.

4152 2018-11-11 22:17:57 Restructuring the evil contraption called Nigeria is a way to take away the monopoly of the Hausa Fulani caliphate power to control the oil blocks in Biafra land which is viably impossible
4153 2018-11-11 22:17:38 Are they heroes, those who’ve been deceived by patriotism to fight for oil and treasure in foreign lands, for the benefit not of us ordinary folks but to further enrich the very, very wealthy, in places that pose no threat to the USA?

4155 2018-11-11 22:17:26 The word "bitumen" is used to refer to the vast Canadian deposits of extremely heavy density crude oil

4170 2018-11-11 22:15:59 Can you believe that the last time the Colts played the Jags in Lucas Oil they allowed 10 sacks. 9 games into 2018 they have allowed 10 TOTAL the entire season!
4171 2018-11-11 22:15:59 It is in debt up to its eyeballs. It only favors the rich. No universal health insurance. Addicted to opioids. Addicted to oil. Racism. Bigotry. 

How is that the greatest? 
4172 2018-11-11 22:15:54 whenever my oil life get to 10% i get one so it might be twice a year idk. my car tell me when lol.

4174 2018-11-11 22:15:43 The trouble is, such vast areas of Borneo have already been ripped up for palm oil. Was pristine forest too. Just vast swathes with nothing but palm oil

Banning the advert has just made it reach even more people so they should never have bothered

Hopefully this raises awareness
4175 2018-11-11 22:15:29 But also! Sometimes lavender oil is really good for calming the skin down, since it’s super irritated! (But not if ur allergic to it lmao)
4176 2018-11-11 22:15:06 Christmas music should be played no more than a month before Christmas, preferably less.

4177 2018-11-11 22:14:45 Are you okay with foreign entities expanding Canada's oil and gas industries?
4178 2018-11-11 22:14:44 Where’s the oil filter? And did you put in new oil ?
4179 2018-11-11 22:14:36 Do I miss Rachel Durham or do I just miss the headache her peppermint oil body splash gives me
4180 2018-11-11 22:14:28 Ton of oil on the track.
4181 2018-11-11 22:14:25 You’ll live longer because of that. 
Once you get a hang of your biscuits do a batch substituting coconut milk and coconut oil 1-1 for milk and butter. You won’t be disappointed!!
4182 2018-11-11 22:14:25 Angola is a very rich country with wonderful sources such as gold, diamonds and oil but criminals like JES, Isabel dos Santos, Zenu, Tchizé (the list goes on). Those corrupts must be stopped by force.
4183 2018-11-11 22:14:12 How many birds and fish were killed by oil spils and acid rain?
4184 2018-11-11 22:14:06 Ditch palm oil!
4185 2018-11-11 22:14:05 Vienna meeting before Christmas may bring a Christmas present to oil longs...  at least that's what bulls believe.
4186 2018-11-11 22:13:33 Love that I took my car in for an oil change, and stuff is missing from my car...

4189 2018-11-11 22:13:27 Maisie re-enacted it tonight with her favourite monkey teddy . . His name is Monkarama !!!! No to palm oil!!!!! @j0hn1nh0
4190 2018-11-11 22:13:14 It’s crazy how oil and money are making the so called leaders of the world blind.
4191 2018-11-11 22:13:03 Sometimes an essential oil takes the edge off for me. Lavender or something equally soothing. That, & medical cannabis 
4192 2018-11-11 22:12:56 exactly. when the oil started to grow it was at the end of the second Putin term. bye.
4193 2018-11-11 22:12:43 There’s a lot of oil on the track.
4194 2018-11-11 22:12:31 A meal in 60 seconds! Chopped beef sausage steamed with soy sauce and olive oil.
4195 2018-11-11 22:12:05 I don’t know shit about the UK’s political advert standards, what I do know is we’re killing the planet and the Orangutans with our use of palm oil
4196 2018-11-11 22:12:01 poor people get poorer really? don't tell me how I live here. we barely survived in the 90's on my mom's 20$/month pension. now she gets $400. 20 TIMES growth. and how much did the oil grow and then? what was the oil price in the 2016?
4197 2018-11-11 22:11:56 Aloha dear Roger! Hope you had a great weekend! Highly penetrative oil. Patch test first. 
1. On damp skin PRESS small amount of oil into skin. Wait 5 min.
2. Begin massaging Upwards into skin. 
3. Proceed with skincare routine. 

Enjoy!

4198 2018-11-11 22:11:51 @NASCAR @NASCARonNBC @DaleJr  red flag this!!! Too much oil. Dont need to lose 20 laps to caution!!!
4199 2018-11-11 22:11:38 Definitely the scallops in garlic, oil and shrimp.  No doubt. 
4200 2018-11-11 22:11:38 I’ve never searched beard oil once on the internet and all of the sudden that’s the only type of advertisement I’m seeing on my social media
4201 2018-11-11 22:11:36 Cotton balls strategically placed with peppermint oil on them, they can't stand the smell and will be gone in no time, plus adds nice fragrance to home. No more spiders either if they don't float your boat either 
4202 2018-11-11 22:11:29 There's your new slogan. "Tripe. Palm oil free for starters."
4203 2018-11-11 22:11:28 Na wa o so harmattan has started jus like that in Abuja... Lemme just go and bring out my pears oil from the deepest part of my wardrobe.
4204 2018-11-11 22:11:09 The Cafe Mac Pizza of the day will be: moist crust with spicy motor oil and chicken.
4205 2018-11-11 22:11:08 Hey Ont & Que Dairy Corporations you stand together & Support Saudi Sheiks & Venezuelan Killer Dictators also USA. Keep getting Oil & Gas from them. Now tell the West why they should buy Eastern Dairy Products. Remember Ontario & Quebec wouldn’t allow a Pipeline for  Oil & Gas.
4206 2018-11-11 22:11:00 I just tried this brown sugar and olive oil scrub and ladies let me tell ya, this shit got my skin feeling smooth af 
4207 2018-11-11 22:10:56 The main culprits are the government & big oil. They both have known about it since the mid 70's and not only did nothing about it, but profited handsomely from it.

It's much like big tobacco and lung cancer only this time, it's our entire habitat that's getting the cancer.
4208 2018-11-11 22:10:50 Especially if I paid 60 or better for the Dexos oil change
4209 2018-11-11 22:10:27 Yes Iceland is very good on recyclable packaging, and now on palm oil. Much more interesting and worthwhile than keech about flags. The Indy movement is increasingly in turmoil, flags give them something to unite around, like an old Holyrood (sorry, Hollywood) Custer movie.
4210 2018-11-11 22:10:27 Hit so hard something went through the oil tank
4211 2018-11-11 22:10:24 I wish this ad could have run with the original @Greenpeace @GreenpeaceUK logo. It is ludicrous that something as simple as saving the orangutan by banning palm oil should be viewed as political. It is our planet, our children’s legacy, it is up to all of us to protect it.

4217 2018-11-11 22:09:23 Dad: Jessie, I saw you had olive oil in the bathroom...what were you doing in there? Making a salad? Some pesto?

Me: Uhh, shaving my legs.

Dad: Well it brings out the Italian in you.
4218 2018-11-11 22:09:22 One extra large coffee with 8 drops of CBD oil
4219 2018-11-11 22:09:20 Whenever I wash my hair and put this oil on my scalp my whole head tingles for hours
4220 2018-11-11 22:09:15 nah it's not about the oil prices. Russia was selling just as much oil in the 90's but nothing was paid to it's budget. it's Putin who returned most of the Russian resources back to state ownership and made oligarchs paid taxes.
4221 2018-11-11 22:09:15 Palm oil free for starters!
4222 2018-11-11 22:09:12 A shaved pussy is a clean pussy!! I just shaved it again and put baby oil on it omg i love it. It feels amazing
4223 2018-11-11 22:09:10 Why tf is oil paint so expensive
4224 2018-11-11 22:08:58 - she just had to dip her hand in the oil for the reach lol
4225 2018-11-11 22:08:55 I would bet he was bigger than those he played against since he as probably 14 and could use that size to beat smaller boys, so he never needed to develop slick hands.  And he isn’t likely to now. IMO and that limits his ability.

4227 2018-11-11 22:08:53 The people who "benefit" by reaping in the money for palm oil, would have had it pulled of air, I am sure!! Its beautiful & very sad. 
4228 2018-11-11 22:08:48 Oil change places can try to hustle me and put that 3,000 mile next oil change sticker in my window all they want to but I read my manual and it said I need an oil change every 7,500 miles
4229 2018-11-11 22:08:44 Pink poinsettias, essential oil candles in my favorite holiday scents, comfy pajamas and silence 
4230 2018-11-11 22:08:41 when abby uses olive oil instead of vegetable oil to make brownies 
4231 2018-11-11 22:08:40 I used too much peppermint oil. My scalp tingling lol
4232 2018-11-11 22:08:23 Growing up to believe the white washed version, the truth still feels like madness and the white supremacists assure me I have indeed gone mad. Truth was always something for gullible marks of cults and snake oil salesmen. The *pursuit* of truth is all I have left of truth.

4234 2018-11-11 22:08:01 Oh man, this oil trader is slick
4235 2018-11-11 22:07:55 Oil rigs?
4236 2018-11-11 22:07:52 Good luck this week everyone 

Interesting times ahead leading up to Xmas with Gold &amp; Oil prices fluctuating all over the shop. 

Remember to stick to your trading rules and leave leave your emotions outside of the trading room .
4237 2018-11-11 22:07:42 If ANY of you EXPERTS are soooo sure Q it just a snake oil salesman then why don’t you just ask POTUS on TV and we can put this ALL to rest??? But we know you won’t because YOU KNOW THE ANSWER!!!!
4238 2018-11-11 22:07:08 My car needs: an oil change, tires and struts (inspection too come December). RIP to my wallet bc it’s also the holiday season
4239 2018-11-11 22:06:50 Also, you can use sketchbooks and paintbooks too. I have a few books for either pencils, oil pastels or painting. Doesn’t hurt to practice on those too.
4240 2018-11-11 22:06:47 What do they care? They'll be proposing whaling for whale oil next, if it means closing down on fossil fuels.
4241 2018-11-11 22:06:44 You need to answer the critics strongly   On Wall Street ! This misinformation on mineral oil is undermining ur stellar work
4242 2018-11-11 22:06:40 Lmaooooo better oil yourself for return leg. We're going deeper
4243 2018-11-11 22:06:34 #SealTeam S2-E1 Action oriented successful 2nd season, Hayes lucky to be back? Securing Mexican oil platform is a fast start, mission extended to day & night after slow bomb defuse time also rebels reinforcements. Gun fights with boats crew & high jump from top while rig on fire.
4244 2018-11-11 22:06:34 Subsidies aren’t illegal! What subsidies have helped him personally due to him being potus? Are you aware how expensive it is to drill for oil and our dependence on it due to its affordability and efficiency?
4245 2018-11-11 22:06:32 Oh, who will buy an independent Scotland's Oil & Gas?
If it weren't for the mettlesome English taking it off our hands for a pittance, we'd have no Oil & Gas industry.
It's worthless.
Which is why it will be wound down, replaced with renewables and rUK can find their own supply.
4246 2018-11-11 22:06:23 I now swear by peppermint tea and peppermint oil good grief what a HUGE difference it has made in 20 minutes
4247 2018-11-11 22:06:02 Everyone chatting about that Aldi advert, but you 90% of them won't ever think about Palm oil again
4248 2018-11-11 22:05:52 Amen. Mr le President, vs devez arreter toutes les guerres. Cette resoinsabilite vs incombe. Je vs en supplue de ne plys etre politiquemt correct. Faut abolir les guerres ki ravagent les pays, tuent hoe, foe et enfants pr de largent, le vice du pouvoir, oil.
4249 2018-11-11 22:05:26 “Off-shore oil drilling” is code for something.
4250 2018-11-11 22:05:07 No palm oil innit? Pure tripe!
4251 2018-11-11 22:05:01 @BillClinton Americans need your help again with deficit and oil prices
4252 2018-11-11 22:05:01 I saw a few other people saying that, but Musk is a well-educated dude who's clearly trying to make oil sound ridiculous for the sake of his argument.

In other words, I think it's pretty clearly implied from the context of the discussion that he knows, and he's being glib.
4253 2018-11-11 22:04:52 That is ridiculous to call it political.  It is as if saying mentioning climate change is political. How mad is this world becoming? Palm oil is a huge issue that affects us all - even those who have blinkers on.
4254 2018-11-11 22:04:42 Gorka vs Q & Q advocates; Snake oil says G. Sounds like the perfect  oil for greasing the skids under a lot of traitorous snakes. One theory,  as Seb is a good guy, he is part of the smoke & mirror patriot  operation. 2nd, he is out of the loop-knows nada, 3rd, Q isn't a thing?
4255 2018-11-11 22:04:38 It’s hard to compete with an oil rich repressive Islamist state who will stop at nothing to burnish their reputation including cheating in a grand scale

4257 2018-11-11 22:04:30 don’t even know where i am man sorry i think my coffee was laced with cbd oil and i’m calling 91 on myself (forgot number )
4258 2018-11-11 22:04:26 That last is about gov’t welfare for corporations (called #subsidies or #taxbreaks). THAT has a long history that includes #oil, #automobiles, #construction, #landlords, #banking, #pharma.  

Helping out nascent industry is no scandal be it the #internet or #sustainable energy.
4259 2018-11-11 22:04:22 I haven’t said anything about oil yet!

4260 2018-11-11 22:04:17 Palm oil is the most economical oil to produce. It takes up to 30x less space per km than other vegetable oils. Get rid of that and we’ve lost a valuable source ingredient for something less viable that requires more space hence leading to further deforestation
4261 2018-11-11 22:04:14 For the record, I do believe that at some point oil will no longer be our main energy source, my logic is that it will be best for all involved if the free market dictates when to transition and into what energy, and as of now that is not happening.
4262 2018-11-11 22:03:55 When Obama opened the Atlantic & Gulf to oil drilling, I called him out for it--big time.

When Obama deported huge numbers of immigrants (though he didn't separate kids from parents), I said "that's wrong."

But you refuse to say Trump is wrong about one single serious thing.

4264 2018-11-11 22:03:47 Shows how much you know. Of course it wasn't a bloody war between NI and ROI. Whoever thought that!? The bombs close to me where ira bombs yea. But I don't support them either, nor do I support this new push on supporting British troops abroad killing for oil and power
4265 2018-11-11 22:03:44 Chop lengthwise, toss in olive oil, salt and pepper - roast in over until browned. Delicious.
4266 2018-11-11 22:03:29 Palm oil should be banned Period,
We need to start putting the ecological needs of this planet we live on first, before we destroy it along with the human race.
4267 2018-11-11 22:03:26 If you're interested in trying CBD oil let us know! We'd love to help you
4268 2018-11-11 22:03:15 they're trying to get off coal, so its not that bad of a thing, plus oil going down
4269 2018-11-11 22:03:06 You aren't fit to speak of veterans. How much have you stolen from the public like all other trump appointees? And endorsing  coal and oil?
4270 2018-11-11 22:03:06 A much stronger lobby to boot. Arab states sit on oil.
4271 2018-11-11 22:02:56 Maybe this is helpful for some of your human friends:
If you are already good in avoiding palm oil products and know which products contain it and which do not, grab your family and friends and go shopping together. Show them the alternatives and save lives together!  
4272 2018-11-11 22:02:54 "Social liberalisation is part of the crown prince’s ambition to wean the economy away from oil. But as our special report sets out, his changes come with more authoritarianism at home, and recklessness abroad. World must hope that the bold prince triumphs over the brutish one"
4273 2018-11-11 22:02:48 When drafted, I viewed Puljujarvi as a 50ish point/two-way guy who plays inside T6 and on both special teams. If paired w/ 97 I the point totals could potentially be a tad higher. Have yet to see that player but still think he gets there. #Oilers
4274 2018-11-11 22:02:42 I give my dog cbd oil for seizures and he’s never had any problems. Just make sure you’re getting one with no THC in it.
4275 2018-11-11 22:02:31 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
4276 2018-11-11 22:02:07 That was a great save.
There were many more once the  quick lotus had dropped most of its oil on that corner too...
4277 2018-11-11 22:01:59 Car washed, oil changed, groceries bought, full tank of gas, and laundry  done 
4278 2018-11-11 22:01:59 No more American imperialism! No more wars abroad for oil and political control!
4279 2018-11-11 22:01:38 Yes because I can easily check my oil.
4280 2018-11-11 22:01:32 And I generally avoid oil -the bread dip in my fridge settling -is a holiday treat only
4281 2018-11-11 22:01:27 今週もゆる～くいきましょ
4282 2018-11-11 22:01:24 doing her own oil change is commendable (I need to learn how) but laying under a car taking a pic is just A LOT. 


4283 2018-11-11 22:01:17 @joshgroban thank u for rt'ing the orangutan commercial. So important to get this info out. I just recently was educated on it. Our zoo is home to many orangutans & they have absolutely no palm oil products (as well as no straws & lids) & at halloween it's candy with no palm oil
4284 2018-11-11 22:00:51 I could smoke a gram of oil before this headache subsides

4290 2018-11-11 22:00:17 November 11, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
4291 2018-11-11 22:00:11 Did you know?

Our "magnesium oil" isn't an oil at all! It is purified water than is so highly concentrated with magnesium chloride that it feels oily. 

#funfact #magnesium #MagnumSolace
4292 2018-11-11 22:00:09 Why in the world would you assume this educated man, regardless of his public opinion, actually thinks oil is made from dead dinosaurs instead of algae and other vegetation? 

Newsflash, Musk's tendency to glib is so well-known that it's literally caused media firestorms for him.
4293 2018-11-11 22:00:09 Just depends how the data is spun. Soya meal is fed to livestock, agreed. % varies depending on the reports. Most of the oil produced is for human consumption with a small % for biodiesel.
4294 2018-11-11 22:00:01 Lol idek how to change my oil 
4295 2018-11-11 22:00:00 The decomposition point of Olive Oil is 220 degrees Celsius #fact
4296 2018-11-11 21:59:48 Peak oil was projected by experts in 1956 to happen by 1970, then 1980, etc. It’s now acknowledged those predictions were erroneous and premature (to say nothing of alarmist).
4297 2018-11-11 21:59:35 The Royal Family of Saudi Arabia, 30,000 strong, own 1.7 Trillion dollars from oil proceeds and their privileged positions. It would be nice to ask the Prince about when democracy will be introduced in SA. And then maybe not The Crown Prince May chop his head  off.
4298 2018-11-11 21:59:34 For $90K, unless you have major towing needs, could do better. I'd go Model X. If you drive 20k a year, you're saving 3k a year on gas, oil and you get great autopilot.
4299 2018-11-11 21:59:18 What you all moan about spending? You all agreed to pay for it either by purchasing your PL packs on Sky or fueling your car with petrol highly likely produced from oil from Gulf. So???
4300 2018-11-11 21:59:11 Nudestix has a bomb face tint for those low coverage days that you want a viel of color and dew, also LOVE their cream blushes and illuminators. Try the Smashbox Primer Oil mixed with Kevyn Aucoin if you want COVERAGEEEEE that still looks fairly fresh.
4301 2018-11-11 21:59:07 Truth be told, the engineering projects were shifting more and more toward oil and gas industry here in PA and we didn't want to be a part of that. I'd do work for renewable energy, but also decided it was better worth my time to do other tasks.
4302 2018-11-11 21:58:52 So Iceland is against palm oil to save orangatans but continues to profit from whaling?

4305 2018-11-11 21:58:18 you threw out oil paint D: isn’t that the most expensive .. estoy moldia omgg
4306 2018-11-11 21:57:59 I believe the ad doesn’t ask for a boycott. It states that until all palm oil causes zero rainforest destruction we’re (Iceland) removing palm oil from all our own label products. I don’t imagine that all own label products account for a huge amount of the stock the hold and sell
4307 2018-11-11 21:57:40 Use Jamaican castor oil from clicks. It really helped me
4308 2018-11-11 21:57:37 I recently visited the west coast and talked with my cousin who is a fire team captain for the forest service. This is a problem with the eucalyptus oil that soaks into the surrounding ground and was allowed to grow beyond the control of state workers.

4312 2018-11-11 21:57:07 if I let my grandmother buy some hundred thousand barrels of crude oil, who cares if she lands on the black list? If there are retired people who are willing to marry immigrants for money, buying oil is much more lucrative 
4313 2018-11-11 21:56:59 Since that oil spill on the Gulf of Mexico in 2004
4314 2018-11-11 21:56:58 A control mechanism that I call modern humane slavery to our thirst towards capitalism. Which I don’t necessary believe is bad, however the System sorta right but like all things it is abused like an religious cult. Eg,,Free energy is here but the oil is our Master.
4315 2018-11-11 21:56:54 I still can't understand why bread has palm oil in it. That's both M&S and Co-Op. Marks says it's sustainable, but why at all?? And it doesn't say so on the packaging. So we don't buy it.
4316 2018-11-11 21:56:50 @MilkybarUKI Hi :) Just wondering if the Palm oil you use in your Wowsomes advent calendar is reasonably sourced?
4317 2018-11-11 21:56:41 @IcelandFoods Thanks for raising awareness of horrific destruction of forests for palm oil. From Reykjavik to Hobart, Tasmania, people care.
4318 2018-11-11 21:56:33 I’m not getting an oil change till I’m on side the road honey car smoking and all
4319 2018-11-11 21:56:25 1. By Newbreed, I mean all politicians identified as so between 1988 to 2000 by General Babangida. These politicians are the enemies of Nigeria. They never grew. They are stunted. They earned the largest amount of money from oil  & squandered it. Now, they fly to Dubai!
4320 2018-11-11 21:56:25 Texas is on track to being the third largest producer of oil in the world. That's why cost of living for housing was like downtown Atlanta when I lived there.
4321 2018-11-11 21:56:24 They did not buy it. They got gov. midle people that with a comission will privatize all people's properties like oil,mining, electrical generating plants etc.
4322 2018-11-11 21:56:23 Using oil money to pay off people from punishing ya for using too much oil money smh
4323 2018-11-11 21:56:23 yeah i have a watercolor set but i threw out all my old oil paints and brushes soooo uh idk why i did that
4324 2018-11-11 21:56:18 Sand, Motor Oil, and magic
4325 2018-11-11 21:56:14 Me: *puts money in savings so I can eat goood this month*

*car battery goes out 
*oil starts leaking from car 
*gets flat tire 

And that’s story of how my eating disorder relapsed

4327 2018-11-11 21:55:53 Sainsbury's garlic and herb coconut oil soft 'cheese' is 
4328 2018-11-11 21:55:51 That's the point. That's the quality of player that played for you folks before the oil money train rolled in. I can imagine the quality of football with him being your player of the year 3 years running. Thanks for the corroboration 
4329 2018-11-11 21:55:50 I feel like Kudra from Jitterbug Perfume.. I am wrapped in Vanilla & Birch body oil, Rose & Argan body butter, and Sandalwood Oil
4330 2018-11-11 21:55:37 Yeah you keep telling me how stupid I am without coming back at me with anything substantive. If an old map and a wiki about the oil industry's beginnings are your idea of a solid rebuttal, then all you've got to offer is disingenuous cuntery and a weak troll game. Pass.
4331 2018-11-11 21:55:29 America and moral values don't mix it's water and oil
4332 2018-11-11 21:55:17 Olive oil, mixed garlic, butter, Parmesan?
4333 2018-11-11 21:55:08 No cause I’m still oil treating my hair 
4334 2018-11-11 21:55:04 lmao 2017 honda. they said bc they have to use non synthetic oil.
4335 2018-11-11 21:55:03 The ingredient is synthetic lemon essence! Chemically identical to the oil from a regular lemon peel, that oil is sometimes included in insecticide. That's the lawsuit lol
4336 2018-11-11 21:55:02 Got an oil cleanser u//w//u
4337 2018-11-11 21:55:00 Mining, logging, housing and hunting are actually more impactful on orangutan populations than palm oil. Yes it impacts negatively, I’m not saying palm production is good in any means, it has an effect certainly; just that there are more pressing issues for the species
4338 2018-11-11 21:54:49 我儘を言うのならば！CDがよかった TDDのおはなし……
4339 2018-11-11 21:54:26 Olive oil too. 
4340 2018-11-11 21:54:18 i made like... some type of brownie crumble shit.. i made it with coconut oil, powered sugar, butter, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, coaca, vanilla extract, and almond extract and it tastes... weird but... good
4341 2018-11-11 21:54:12 I’m no oil expert but it seems to me that OPEC understands keeping a healthy balance of demand and a healthy international economy because it is in their best interest.
4342 2018-11-11 21:54:10 The way Maiduguri girls like guys with car you'll think they breastfed them with engine oil 
4343 2018-11-11 21:54:06 Chop eight cups of olive oil and set timer for 3 minutes.
4344 2018-11-11 21:54:06 Who's going to do all the mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction and where? Somebody will.
4345 2018-11-11 21:54:05 Doesnt matter i may not live england or in manchester but that doesnt matter really just the fact oil money comes then city fans go we are the best in manchester bothers me really first win 16 more PL's  and 4 CL trophies then we wil talk before that #MUFC
4346 2018-11-11 21:54:00 I ain’t mad! She single. We can change oil together.......
4347 2018-11-11 21:53:53 少なくとも嘗てTDDには""愛""があったってことの裏付けになるじゃんそんな……そんなキャッチコピー……………
4348 2018-11-11 21:53:36 people really being negative about that girl posting that she know how to do her own oil change. wow y’all lame 
4349 2018-11-11 21:53:31 Spuneți la revedere vergeturilor și petelor provocate de soare . "Cu Justine Tissue Oil Gold și compoziția sa unică, veți îmbunătăți tenul în cel mai scurt timp".

4352 2018-11-11 21:53:02 いやいやそんなん全然構わへんよむしろ私なんかがそんなOILの小説の表紙だなんて本当申し訳ないって言うか、人間描き慣れてなくてごめんなぁ(号泣)っていうか、そんなふうに関わらせてもらって有難いというか、そんな感じ。
ほら、拭けよ((ｲｹﾎﾞｫ
4353 2018-11-11 21:52:27 I’ve started making beard balm an will also try oil in the future, any Guinea pigs wanna free sample of beard balm?? All natural, no shit chemicals no worries, let me know thanks #bearded
4354 2018-11-11 21:52:22 Dudesss really tried to say the oil change would cost more than what I normally pay.. pfffft no

4356 2018-11-11 21:52:02 Don't take it personally, Texas is using more solar wind and water and less fossil fuels, Allen is holding onto an 80's oil rush pipe dream fueled by trump fox propaganda and Allen is mad his dreams are shattering right in front of his fat face

4360 2018-11-11 21:51:41 Just made some weed coffee with this coconut oil. Lol
4361 2018-11-11 21:51:41 Fellow pet parents, please start adding 1-2 teaspoons of coconut oil to your fur babies' food. Not only do they love the taste, there are MULTIPLE benefits including naturally repels fleas/ticks, soothes skin, and makes their fur soft and shiny!!
4362 2018-11-11 21:51:40 It’s night 2 of 5 and my car light came on this morning saying I needed an oil change 
4363 2018-11-11 21:51:16 Calls for a boycott on oil palm like the current Iceland ad will most likely lead to a switch in vegetable oils in products which may have unforeseen impacts on forests elsewhere. Certified palm oil such as @RSPOtweets & @PalmInnovation supports deforestion free palm oil
4364 2018-11-11 21:51:11 Yes!! Palm oil is bad!! Can we please get Nutella to make the US products without palm oil? The European ones don’t have it. Please!! 
4365 2018-11-11 21:51:05 Try peppermint oil 
4366 2018-11-11 21:51:04 Y’all bashing shawdy cause she can change oil .. but can the dude you fuck with change your oil or does even pump y’all gas ... y’all gotta mind y’all f***ing business when it doesn’t concern you ! y’all dumb ass females be killing that’s why i don’t be f***ing with social media.
4367 2018-11-11 21:50:48 愛憎って……………ねえ……
4368 2018-11-11 21:50:43 1. Oil. Every other foreign policy decision follows. Also we need MI buyers, don't want them cozy with Russia. Mr. "modern" MBS is sure acting medieval, and deserves every negative consequence not only for #Khashoggi, but for the dumpster fire that is happening in Yemen.
4369 2018-11-11 21:50:38 Steamed and smothered in butter out roasted in olive oil and paprika
4370 2018-11-11 21:50:29 Mr Obi, the Nigerian Customs never declared a trillion naira revenue in all the over 30 years of PDP misrule that distributed the national wealth to a few individuals through import waivers, oil mining license and shameless confiscation of govt property. #NigeriaDecides2019
4371 2018-11-11 21:50:28 It's only Nigerians who buy anointing oil and apron for protection, from a pastor who has 10 bodyguards with Guns.
4372 2018-11-11 21:50:13 I got an oil change for my car today. PLUS a mount for my phone for my trip to Colorado PLUS a new car charger FOR said trip PLUS a new yankee candle car sensy thing that makes my car smell like the man of my dreams. I was a good car mom today. That is allllllll
4373 2018-11-11 21:50:13 TDDコミカライズ、「愛憎のStory」ってキャッチコピーなのがさ…………ふかく…かんがえてしまう…………
4374 2018-11-11 21:50:06 Now that #Maduro has run #Venezuela's oil production into the ground what does he have left to pay the Chinese with but narcotrafficking?
4375 2018-11-11 21:50:03 Oil seems to be the most debated stream this morning.

Should stoke the debate with a debatable move this week.

4376 2018-11-11 21:50:00 OMG i can smell the tzatziki and olive oil, hear the bouzouki music in the background... This takes me back to so many memories of summers spent in my dad's hometown of Kerkyra and time hopping around many other islands. 
4377 2018-11-11 21:49:54 Funk bitches get oil #fbgo
4378 2018-11-11 21:49:32 Gonna get an oil change tomorrow pray 4 me 
4379 2018-11-11 21:49:30 Was not Niger delta avengers that were bombing oil installation, and halt oil production to half???? Don't forget oil provides 80% of Nigerian foreign exchange
4380 2018-11-11 21:49:27 i was thinking about that oil spill & it occurred to me it was hushed up too quickly so i did a search & found this article it joined the dots for alot of unexplained events
4381 2018-11-11 21:49:26 why are you cooking oil?
4382 2018-11-11 21:49:18 "My original intention was to stay through the end of the school year in CH-UH, but I understand the urgency in wanting me there sooner in Columbus," Dixon said.  @CHUHSupt @CHUHSchools to do what?  Help yet another school district get an F?  What snake oil are you selling?!
4383 2018-11-11 21:49:12 And a few days after ISIS was born to destabilize the region. US and Qatar working together...Oil Gas Pipeline War
4384 2018-11-11 21:49:09 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
4385 2018-11-11 21:49:02 But Kyle pitted... I don’t care if he drained out all the oil in his car. KEEP IT GREEN!!!
4386 2018-11-11 21:49:00 All I can really want right now is plain pasta with a little olive oil and red pepper... but that’s not going to work now is it..
4387 2018-11-11 21:48:59 What has he done? Our local IBEW has no work. New NAFTA is the same agreement, changes don't kick in until they reach an unattainable limit. He just rebranded GDP is up b/c the cost of goods have skyrocketed b/cof tariffs. He is a snake oil salesmen and you are falling for it.
4388 2018-11-11 21:48:43 yeah and then i use a product that has it. i use the actual oil to treat as drying lotion or as an acne spot treatment.
4389 2018-11-11 21:48:24 Plug any gaps with wire wool or tinfoil. And sprinkle peppermint oil around where you think they might be. They can’t stand the smell.
4390 2018-11-11 21:48:23 That will keep rail road stock up (warren buffet)  that will keep value in south american communist oil (obama's donors) they will keep fuel prices higher (investors at the 1%)  it doesnt stop the resource from being used just who benefits from the production #greenscam
4391 2018-11-11 21:48:22 If y’all can guess how long I’ve needed an oil change, I’ll send you $3
4392 2018-11-11 21:48:12 Good to hear! Perhaps labelling as ‘sustainable palm oil’ might help?

4395 2018-11-11 21:48:09 funny part is, I can't change my own oil 
4396 2018-11-11 21:48:06 oil king pants > poongko shirt
4397 2018-11-11 21:48:02 Change your oil
4398 2018-11-11 21:47:40 It's also closer to over 90% of the UK's Oil supply...
4399 2018-11-11 21:47:26 @CarnegieEndow
@RockefellerFdn @SenateGOP @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan if Saudi cut 50,000 barrel of oil. We saw fallen of Wall by raised interest rate. if Saudi will do, we must ruin Saudi Empire.

4401 2018-11-11 21:47:18 Please be careful Jeffree! I've found that running a room purifier and using essential oil diffusers help when I'm flared!
4402 2018-11-11 21:47:18 I miss the smell of tanning oil
4403 2018-11-11 21:47:14 Decimation of population is ABSOLUTELY caused by palm oil production. You're saying it doesn't have to be, and perhaps it doesn't. But right now, it is. Palm oil demand is far from sustainable as is. It would be terrific to switch to sustainable but until then I'm boycotting.
4404 2018-11-11 21:47:06 Despite vying against a club that uses oil money,illegally funneled in,to win titles,@LFC is holding their own. They are doing well,I am proud of them #YNWA
4405 2018-11-11 21:46:53 I’m not getting under no car for an oil change 
4406 2018-11-11 21:46:46 Oui oui sans parler de design mais j’approuve totalement l’Arrowhead et Lucas oil sont incroyable, Sport Authority Field j’en suis fou aussi c’est un alliage moderne/historique
4407 2018-11-11 21:46:38 I’ve been looking for my coconut oil for DAYS and come to find out my fucking brother took it and used all of it for a lame ass Halloween costume 
LIVIDDDDD
4408 2018-11-11 21:46:35 Y’all were literally running on the highway . Saw y’all around that forte oil.
4409 2018-11-11 21:46:25 @pepsi my family were consumers of your products - until today. Palm oil - that's all I'm saying.
4410 2018-11-11 21:46:24 1,200 for Soup, 300 for pack of Semo

4411 2018-11-11 21:46:15 It's oil, it's wheat, it's soil, it's meat, it's beef!
4412 2018-11-11 21:45:49 Why do you still use palm oil and animal fats in your products if you really care about these issues?
4413 2018-11-11 21:45:32 -Snake oil has its purpose
-He is not an anon
-He stands by it everyday saying what he believes.
-its all an information operation, even yours
-no ones opinion is more important than any others, let us decide.
4414 2018-11-11 21:45:26 Trump annihilated 300 Russians on the battlefield. 

USA produced more oil than Russia for the first time since 1999.

#MoreFlexability #Reset #ResetButton #Uraninum #Crimea #NotTrump 

Your ignorance is astonishing.
4415 2018-11-11 21:45:22 There's no way to achieve a 100% boycott anyway. The vast majority of people won't get the message or care. The point of boycotting is to reduce human consumption enough that the palm oil farmers don't need to continue expansion to meet demand. We use too much right now, simply.
4416 2018-11-11 21:45:17 Has anyone tried CBD oil? Is the feeling closer to taking an Advil, or does it make you feel like your on mushrooms?  Help a girl out. 

P.S. I’ve smoked  since I was 14. (I’m 26 now.) But never tried CBD oil. Any advice for a first timer? 
#cbdoil #CBDvsTHC #Medical
4417 2018-11-11 21:45:04 This advert is not political it’s environmental.If they ban this advert they should ban all adverts on products that contain Palm Oil.
4418 2018-11-11 21:44:46 Don't be stupid. We can have a green country while getting stupid people to buy oil. It's what every other country does . Why on earth would you hold a Scottish Government to a higher standard than Westminster ?
4419 2018-11-11 21:44:39 Tell me how I underestimated this essential oil and accidentally put in 7 drops of eucalyptus in my tiny diffuser LMAO WOOPS
4420 2018-11-11 21:44:19 Please take out your Palm Oil....am sick of seeing it in your products.
4421 2018-11-11 21:44:08 I’m at such a loss about what to do about Mos’ separation anxiety. I seriously just don’t even know what to do except give him CBD oil which makes him mostly sleep 
4422 2018-11-11 21:43:29 Why not just #Oil ? You're probably going to ruin this for me but I am living in ignorance about what OOTT actually means
4423 2018-11-11 21:43:26 Exactly why did you leave the WH Gork, and why are you attacking Q now? you worried ? If you were honest you can see Q  not snake oil, but if you prefer to agree with the wave of attacks on Q by the Fake News be my guest>
4424 2018-11-11 21:43:23 I don’t need to follow oil based sauce guidelines because I’m not Italian !!! Born and raised Quebec -pure French Canadian here last time I checked
4425 2018-11-11 21:43:22 Anyone who blocks pipelines are all a bunch of idiots and hypocrites. Canada is losing out on Billions of dollars our economy desperately needs. It’s the safest way to transport oil and gas. Yet for some reason it’s being done by rail transport and ship.
4426 2018-11-11 21:43:19 Absolutely! Morticia Addams in raven wing/oil slick AB rhinestones FTW
4427 2018-11-11 21:43:17 I’d rather oil companies become energy companies than oil companies stay their path on oil and damn the planet.
4428 2018-11-11 21:43:15 Should we celebrate! Such scenarios are found in oil producing countries!
4429 2018-11-11 21:43:12 Stainless steel #nameplates are extremely durable, and they can withstand the harsh environments common in the oil and gas industry.
4430 2018-11-11 21:43:10 Has it got palm oil?
4431 2018-11-11 21:43:07 Ameen Ameen
4432 2018-11-11 21:42:54 Destorying forestry in Malasia, Indonesia has to stop gone on too long. Protect the land impose large fines to the workers at the bottom of the chain, need to engage them to find alternative industry. Palm oil so saturated in fat bad for  anyway. Cost too great to continue.
4433 2018-11-11 21:42:51 How do you use the argan oil? I got some as a gift but have no idea how to use it
4434 2018-11-11 21:42:36 Saute with garlic, pepper and olive oil. Love the sprouts!
4435 2018-11-11 21:42:35 A little birdie (aka calendar) told me the 15th is my 1 year CB cammiversary  Guess I should do a show eh?  Now where did i put that baby oil……
4436 2018-11-11 21:42:34 If you look hard enough I bet you could find a tomahawk about as big as she is
4437 2018-11-11 21:42:31 Nah she valid bro that’s def oil & the locking nut for the oil pan lol
4438 2018-11-11 21:42:20 I’ve been driving with low oil for 2 days now 
4439 2018-11-11 21:42:18 Thank you Cobblestone for the free oil change and great service. You guys are awesome!
4440 2018-11-11 21:42:18 Absolutely agree with you. I went to pick up a packet and put it back. SORT IT OUT. I don't want palm oil in my food or my kids' food.

4442 2018-11-11 21:41:40 Rosemary oil has been a success
4443 2018-11-11 21:41:35 If you are equating Q to Snake Oil then I will definately reconsider following you.  Your Tweet is ignorant cause you call it snake oil yet cant prove it.  Just because YOU think it is doesn't make it so..
4444 2018-11-11 21:41:35 Shetland's oil and Shetland's fish :-)
SNP take far too much for granted.
See how they cope when the boot is on the other foot.
Why should pro-UK populations be taken out of the UK against their will?
4445 2018-11-11 21:41:29 The little blip we have seen in oil's global decline rates flattening out will not last. With a greater percentage of oil production coming from shale & over half of all oil fields being past peak production this trend is simply a temporary reprieve. Deep value in intl micro-caps

4448 2018-11-11 21:41:12 I mean what does she need oil and water when they don't mix? Ox spit and chicken poo? Really now your telling me this nonsense can be compared to Moffats era of writing which had purpose and reason to exsist.
4449 2018-11-11 21:41:06 I only use the Rubi so I can vape my CBD oil. Really comes in handy. 
4450 2018-11-11 21:40:57 Brent oil must see strong resistance as black gold supply will be limited from tomorrow. 6-7% rally is coming.
4451 2018-11-11 21:40:52 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
4452 2018-11-11 21:40:52 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

4461 2018-11-11 21:40:02 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
4462 2018-11-11 21:39:30 Not all palm oil is bad and boycotting it completely is not the answer! Support sustainable palm oil and look for the RSPO logo

4464 2018-11-11 21:39:05 Un ami pétrolier me disait qu’il avait commencé à entendre parler du fameux « peak oil » avant même le premier choc de 73...
4465 2018-11-11 21:39:05 It's bad policy. We're investing billions in technology that has a very short future. We shouldn't be expanding oil infrastructure, but instead work on expanding green energy infrastructure. Makes more sense in essentially every way.
4466 2018-11-11 21:39:04 @PremierFoods_FS why does Angel delight have palm oil in it? Is it really necessary.
4467 2018-11-11 21:39:00 My dogs arse vs my eucalyptus oil diffuser is a horrid battle this evening
4468 2018-11-11 21:38:57 Hey @francisdiet please unblock me. I love sambuca and anal with baby oil. I’ll even wear my uniform if you like it. You fucking cunt.
4469 2018-11-11 21:38:46 I saw fences. Remember to get an oil heater for out there at winter time, and to get LED grow lights.
4470 2018-11-11 21:38:36 Flipping the situation around — how would you feel about a western writer who took an oil company-paid gig writing about jobs created by the Keystone XL pipeline?
4471 2018-11-11 21:38:32 So you don't support the NHS, elected governments serving their voters or in having an army for defense not invading countries to steal their oil?

Nationhood is about shared identity so people look after each other.

It doesn't stop nations working with each other.
4472 2018-11-11 21:38:24 RT if you do try to watch out for palm oil when making shopping choices.

Like if you will try.

Salutations to your regiment!
4474 2018-11-11 21:38:10 @Tesco Purchased ‘pork roasting joint’ today. Didn’t check the ingredients because, well, it should be just pork. Disgusted when I got home to find ‘palm oil’ listed. Really?! Needless to say this lifetime Tesco shopper will be switching allegiance. #PalmOil #PalmOilAlarmCall
4475 2018-11-11 21:37:55 But why do they still use palm oil and animal fat in their products if they really care about this issue?
4476 2018-11-11 21:37:45 In the previous century wealth was defined as material goods; oil, cotton, gold. Now it's knowledge. Yet Trump refuses too learn anything and the GOP cuts funding for education.

4481 2018-11-11 21:37:10 @altonbrown Can I fry the baked potato fries in the same oil that I fry the fish in? Or will it be to fishy if so, should I heat up to quarts to start or one court for the fission add another quart? #TryingToSaveTheOil #TryingToSaveTime
4482 2018-11-11 21:37:09 And we don’t use oil based sauce -I like red sauce not oil for spaghetti

4486 2018-11-11 21:36:50 It raised my, normally low, cholesterol so much that my readings came in recommending chol. lowering drugs. Thankfully my doc & I talked about how I cook, she realized how much coconut oil I was using, I eliminated it, and it went back to normal levels. It took 6 months though.
4487 2018-11-11 21:36:42 Oh? How about we start start shutting off those power grids and stop turning that oil out?

4490 2018-11-11 21:36:10 OPEC SEC-GEN SAYS 2019 MIGHT REQUIRE NEW STRATEGIES TO BALANCE THE OIL MARKET

週末の産油国会合、供給増加と需要減速リスクで戦略調整の必要性を議論も、12月OPEC総会に先送り。JTCに対して検証を指示。
4491 2018-11-11 21:36:10 A very uncertain pair to trade from a macro perspective. The UK Gov/Brexit is challenging to analyze. Oil could slide lower. Looks to be rewarding if things play out as you predict.
4492 2018-11-11 21:36:05 @MoltonBrownUK as a huge fan, can you confirm if you use Palm Oil and whether this is sustainable. Be lovely to know. Thank You
4493 2018-11-11 21:35:59 why would the UK remove this advert? Rainforest destruction is happening and palm oil is an insidious evil that consumers need to know about - what say you @GreenpeaceNZ Does the UK need to grow a pair?
4494 2018-11-11 21:35:56 I believe that's why now Iceland is encouraging people to reduce their demand for palm oil so that palm oil can be produced without having to destroy rainforests in the future
4495 2018-11-11 21:35:33 Hope we get to see some oil tonight
4496 2018-11-11 21:35:31 jesus christ, yall are really burning the midnight oil trying to come up with as many possible ways to muddy the waters of a white cis guy sexually abusing people as you can

4498 2018-11-11 21:35:29 He has no respect for his people, constantly belittling the lower class with insults he doesn't even hide anymore, taxes them more but not the rich & big companies, is ultra-capitalist, oh and several ministers were (are) big lobbyists for oil and plastic companies.
4499 2018-11-11 21:35:28 

Flashing all that oil? She's asking for it.
4500 2018-11-11 21:35:17 Big same, gonna add rubbing alcohol, canola oil and paint thinner on there too
4501 2018-11-11 21:35:10 The Arabs can learn a lot about agriculture and food from Israel.

No one stole anything from the Arabs, they have little to offer except sand and oil.
History proves that many of the Islamic customs were taken from Judaism
4502 2018-11-11 21:35:06 Use olive oil.  Save him!

4505 2018-11-11 21:34:58 No but I know it’s a reason to not use Palm Oil products.  Makes me sick.  I will never forget the mama playing peek a boo with you at the zoo when you were little. 
4506 2018-11-11 21:34:49 I’m curious,how is Trudeau incompetent on this issue? By agreeing to subsidize oil to Americans ? Did you forget who they’re leader is now ? Do you think the Andrew sheer would have made a better deal?
4507 2018-11-11 21:34:37 I bought Cole an oil diffuser for his room and hes obsessed it. He refilled it 3 times yesterday and once right away this morning. And he asked me to bring him more oils to create blends
4508 2018-11-11 21:34:34 @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden OPEC+ ready to make oil price great again. I want your response.
4509 2018-11-11 21:34:31 Saudi Arabia no longer has to skirt somolia (somewhere a proxy army also could be easily placed to shut down that side) to ship their oil, 2) Saudi needs a small scale war to train competent soilders, compared to Iran or the kurds or the isrealis their soldiers are fundamentally
4510 2018-11-11 21:34:17 I have been pondering food ethics a lot lately.   You get more vegoil per unit of land from palm oil than any other. We stop palm oil we need more soybeans. U end up saving one rainforest and destroying more of another.

Not unlike the trolley problem in ethical studies.
4511 2018-11-11 21:34:12 eating bare oil mashes up your skin
4512 2018-11-11 21:34:05 Snake oil salesman
4513 2018-11-11 21:34:02 I started to inform people about palm oil and the problems that come with it about 8 years ago. Never got tired of it, even if it is frustraiting sometimes. I banned it from my life completely to save you, your family and many others.
You will never be forgotten! 
4514 2018-11-11 21:34:02 I speaking specifically of US based oil company Texaco supporting Franco's fascist government during the Spanish Civil War while red baiting as "communists" those who opposed Franco at home.
4515 2018-11-11 21:33:45 Our military is used to getting conned and manipulated by Republicans.

Nixon, Bush Jr., Trump..They're all the same. To Republicans, dying or being wounded in oil wars means nothing. Just as long as their elite war machine corporate buddies make billions.
4516 2018-11-11 21:33:43 troops in the ME maybe serve some powerful interests like big oil or sumn

don’t serve the people tho:/

and what do we care about NK ?!

tha heck they gonna do to us?

they’re afraid of us that’s why they build nukes we stage ‘war games’ on their border

war ain’t no ‘game’
4517 2018-11-11 21:33:40 we gave our dog with cancer dog CBD oil, it helped with her pain and all that. CBD oil is amazing, good for you! I love Ellie, I hope she gets better soon!
4518 2018-11-11 21:33:23 if ur putting coconut oil on ur face.. babe.. pls stop that
4519 2018-11-11 21:33:14 I can’t see it being a direct replacement for a gas/oil burner with resistance coil. Maybe electric boiler/heater 
4520 2018-11-11 21:33:12 We've bin boycotting palm oil products since we learnt about it
4521 2018-11-11 21:33:10 I was a supporter of Hick too.  He will land on his feet.  Unfortunately, nationally he isn’t progressive enough for the staunch anti oil/gas progressives. In Colorado it works well because of our large o & g workforce.  I think he would be great against 1 term Cory
4522 2018-11-11 21:33:01 @drm_12 it was good to see you in Lucas oil today I miss you in colts blue man!
4523 2018-11-11 21:32:59 sell off all this land to Oil & Gas for drilling our natural resources, so they can export all our natural resources.  and this will keep America energy independent?
4524 2018-11-11 21:32:56 My step dad got my oil changed, washed & vacuumed out my car AND filled it up with gas. It’s seriously the little things... I’m so blessed
4525 2018-11-11 21:32:46 I don’t have one, but I’ve always wanted to use one to roast fresh vegetables with olive oil, maybe some garlic salt. Or maybe for a stir fry!
4526 2018-11-11 21:32:35 Like Yemen, I believe there are two main reasons for the war in Yemen. The main one being access to shipping routes, If a future war with Iran takes place they can close the straight of hormuz, restricting the flow of 30 percent of the worlds oil, If yemen is annexed or conquered
4527 2018-11-11 21:32:32 It will be 7-1 by the time you wake up. 
4528 2018-11-11 21:32:15 No oil leak

4531 2018-11-11 21:31:45 All that oil looks landlocked unless the Turks or the SAA are helping them. The USA can't do squat except fly it out.
4532 2018-11-11 21:31:34 okay but have you tried frying tomatoes, mushrooms, onions and pepper on olive oil, adding italian spices and putting that on pasta? it's so simple yet so good
4533 2018-11-11 21:31:21 Oil paint, a lot of snack breaks, and complete silence. Lol...Everyone paints differently so I don’t really have tips, you just have to invest a lot of time into just practicing what feels good for you, mediums, brushes, different strokes.
4534 2018-11-11 21:31:20 I really don’t know why I thought some stupid ass store bought hair products would help my hair better than one of my grandmothers oil and herb concoctions

4537 2018-11-11 21:31:07 So I partake of something called skittles and I’m assuming this is some type of oil that goes in the vape...well survey says I’m high as hell and I need one
4538 2018-11-11 21:31:01 Looks great! What brushes do you usually use for your oil painting portraits? I can’t find a good set
4539 2018-11-11 21:30:58 We have many people here who have businesses in the gas/oil pipeline business.
4540 2018-11-11 21:30:58 can i have y’alls input on tea tree oil pls
4541 2018-11-11 21:30:49 Combing my beard and putting oil in it wishing it was as legendary as @fenerattack92 teach me your ways you legend

4545 2018-11-11 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
4546 2018-11-11 21:30:15 No I get why they stayed. I wonder what would flourish there? It sounds goofy but CBD oil grows on pretty marginal land.
4547 2018-11-11 21:30:11 So they truck the oil from Dier ez Zor up into NW Syria?  And from there where? Not to Turkey or to the coast.
4548 2018-11-11 21:29:54 When I was little we never used palm oil (50 yrs ago) and we don’t need it now. Nowadays we use far too many unnecessary ingredients 
4549 2018-11-11 21:29:52 Cnest une voiture à l'essence, donc ça pollue pas 
4550 2018-11-11 21:29:32 So respect requires all press to pitch underhanded softballs to President. We the citizens are on a need to know basis and our government will tell us what the Snake Oil President wants us to think.
4551 2018-11-11 21:29:29 Chili Oil is made by infusing a type of base oil like vegetable oil with chili pepper. It is commonly used in preparing chinese dishes and also in high demand in East and South East Asia. 

Hope that helps?
4552 2018-11-11 21:29:25 Everything you said plus maybe peppermint balm or oil.  Don’t know if you meant prescription meds, for me only triptans help and ibuprofen doesn’t . 
Also , I recently read a lot of good things about cbd oil but haven’t tried it yet. Fucking migraines 
4553 2018-11-11 21:29:17 Got my first essential oil! I want to get more now! 
4554 2018-11-11 21:28:52 What is he drilling?  Na crude oil or what? Answer now or we charge u for....................
4555 2018-11-11 21:28:45 Pretty sure getting humans to apply coconut oil to their skin is an alien plot to make us edible.
4556 2018-11-11 21:28:32 You are the second very smart person I know saying to look for longs on oil.
4557 2018-11-11 21:28:32 @autocar @AutoExpress @whatcar @TheAA_UK Can someone please explain why fuel prices at the pumps are still high despite the drop in oil prices? #uplikearocket #downlikeafeather 
4558 2018-11-11 21:28:31 Well...that shows everyone how confident he is with his "win"? The republicans have become the ultimate stunt masters, snake oil salesmen and conspiracy theorists in the country. Liars, cheaters and thieves, it seems.
4559 2018-11-11 21:28:19 Constantly horrified by how many @waitrose products contain palm oil. It's a nasty cheap filler with terrible environmental implications. Why can't you do better?
4560 2018-11-11 21:28:11 I’m a holistic doctor and I prescribe CBD oil regularly because it is powerful medicine. Thanks for spreading the word!
4561 2018-11-11 21:28:10 Alhamdulillah
4562 2018-11-11 21:27:58 Could u imagine if every bro who shits on astrology + crystals redirected that energy to shitting on ppl who don’t believe in climate change. There would be no more fossil fuels in use , we’d be using 100% wind and solar , fishes would be fishing without gobbling oil
4563 2018-11-11 21:27:30 Dude, on Friday my buddy had a dab rig with some Super Silver Haze cannabis oil. I took the biggest hit of my life, and coughed for like a half hour. 

So, it was Friday.

4575 2018-11-11 21:25:59 No problem, widely reported though as having been banned from TV. Good anyway that it is highlighting the problem of palm oil
4576 2018-11-11 21:25:58 tea tree oil! if you put it on the bump a couple times a day it should go away in a few weeks (:
4577 2018-11-11 21:25:54 Asking this seriously and not sarcastically - do you believe that if we don't build P/L the affect will be less oil used globally to effect emissions? BGC it almost assuredly won't. The same amnt of oil will be used with or w/o CAD P/L and therefore won't impact global climate.

4583 2018-11-11 21:25:33 Veneer and public appearance have become as endemic as useless as 'celebrity' in Britain, smart suits and the appearance of 'clean respectability' cover a cesspit of foul-minded self-serving snake oil salespeople.
4584 2018-11-11 21:25:27 Nor should it. 'It's England's oil' even though it's in Scotland's Territorial Waters. Why is this so? Because we say it is.
4585 2018-11-11 21:25:05 There was noise here that the president had made a wrong move announcing oil we dnt have, largely from the opposition, so i dnt think we need to worry since there is no oil  unless if the opposition and Jonso are backtracking and saying ED's announcements were correct!

4591 2018-11-11 21:24:40 I use an eco egg. If I do gym clothes I use a little white vinegar in the wash-saves so much money, is vegan &cruelty free (the egg contains tourmaline & essential oil beads only).

4595 2018-11-11 21:24:27 How about helping by doing something to alleviate climate change.  STOP supporting BIG OIL and FRACKING!  Introduce legislation that regulates carbon emissions,  and make a way for our country to grow our foods instead of raising meat!
4596 2018-11-11 21:24:26 OPEC and Russia meeting:

Russian oil minister Alexander Novak said that the alliance studied a scenario in which oversupply reached 1.2 mb/d next year.

Omani oil minister confirmed that “there is consensus that there will be oversupply in 2019”.

4598 2018-11-11 21:24:00 Switching to alternative energy so we can start reigning in oil companies so we can actually focus on finding a scientific solution to over pollution of our planet and maybe even a way of giving strength back to the atmosphere.
4599 2018-11-11 21:23:55 Probably baby oil
4600 2018-11-11 21:23:55 I don't know why I took until know to realize that I should probably be suspicious of a major oil company literally called "Shell Corporation"

I mean, that's almost too obvious right?
4601 2018-11-11 21:23:53 As it gets more expensive we go to places it didn’t make sense to dig.  Nobody knows exactly when but it will eventually run out.  Also need to work on better recycling since plastics are in the majority of our manufacturing and will be an issue when oil goes to 200-300 a barrel.
4602 2018-11-11 21:23:53 I was willing to be quite for four years and give him a chance. Then the Muslim ban, children licked in cages, oil drill off the coast if my state, and I could go on. So no I won't give Treason Trump a break until he's jailed. Then he can have two hours in the yard that a break.
4603 2018-11-11 21:23:44 Mr wilding does. Make sure you add enough oil to losen
4604 2018-11-11 21:23:41 This advert should never have been banned!  When shopping for products i always look to make sure they don't contain palm oil along with any other nasty ingredients and added chemics, this is the reason why i grow my own because i know their organic and clean!

4607 2018-11-11 21:22:54 Its not about them getting bored its about using football clubs to increase tourism to their respective countries because peak oil is looming & they need a plan b. Also a benevolent pr thing to keep people from looking behind their doors. Dodgy at home, dodgy away.

4609 2018-11-11 21:22:41 Depends entirely on what they're replacing palm oil with.  Palm oil is by far the most eco friendly in terms of yield and fertiliser use for such products.  They'd be better to concentrate on lobbying for sustainable production.
4610 2018-11-11 21:22:29 We need to do more to protect orangutans. They are some of the most spectacular and wonderful creatures on the planet, yet over 100 die in palm oil clearings each week. Check the label.

4618 2018-11-11 21:21:56 We do I ours in rice cooker. Works well. Tip: add a spritz of oil to the top after adding water. Keeps it from boiling over.
4619 2018-11-11 21:21:32 Weaker USD would drive much higher tax receipts.  Oil at $120 would be very stimulative for US
4620 2018-11-11 21:21:30 Corporate greed with, very out of control, selfish for profit fiscal misbehaviour, seeking accruement of wealth is at the core of this matter, as with most other.
Not: use of Palm oil.
With responsible behaviour there would be very few, lasting, threat filled problems Universally
4621 2018-11-11 21:21:29 Some might feel like this is a weird flex but I applaud you because I wish I could change my oil myself.

4625 2018-11-11 21:20:52 Even as a disabled person, I feel like a class traitor every time I take my car to a real mechanic. My dad did head gaskets, timing belts, clutches, exhausts, and at least one engine swap. I can just about change my oil, if I have a day to recover afterwards.
4626 2018-11-11 21:20:38 Good point. I hear this sometimes in real life from relatives. Right wingers, oil shills cynically use this to justify climate destruction.
4627 2018-11-11 21:20:29 Hey, @NRA, stay in your own lane. Quit funneling money into the pockets of politicians (that’s the job of oil companies) so that our outdated gun laws can be changed for the better.
4628 2018-11-11 21:20:15 I can't wait to having to go back to the chemist to get olive oil. There was rationing until 1954.

Will the ration book have a nice blue cover?

Care to name & shame?

AFAIK no one thinks oil will last forever.

In fact 'peak oil' was first prophesied in 1956, to occur by 2000.

And despite all those extra years of consumption, more of the stuff is being found.

4659 2018-11-11 21:14:43 Please explain that to the United States, which has doubled its oil production over the past 10-15 years. Please also explain that to the world's major oil producers, who are pumping more oil now than ever in history. Let me know how it goes.

4663 2018-11-11 21:14:24 It's actually brilliant, as the only losers are the palm oil touting vendors. Good cause wins, Iceland wins, consumer wins. Public pressure should bring other vendors into line also, potentially another big win. When the bean counters feel the consumer denial they'll change tac.

4714 2018-11-11 21:08:52 the only fam oil lee that matters fuck those twitter things
4715 2018-11-11 21:08:50 who mixes tuna and roast beef anyway and drowns it on sub oil with cheddar cheese and toasts it anyway? Lol.

eediots.
4716 2018-11-11 21:08:18 We have owners who leech the club, saddling us with a debt near half a billion.

City, they spend with no restrictions, might not play fair and get away with it, but that’s partly why. If oil money pulled out, they’d be nowhere again as it’s unsustainable. We need rid of Glazers.
4717 2018-11-11 21:08:10 SNL bending over backwards to lick the boots of that fascist. Hot tip: if you don't want to get your face exploded, try not occupying a foreign country for oil interests.
4718 2018-11-11 21:08:09 Palm oil seems to be in a significant number of products. I never noticed before. Was reading about sustainable palm oil sources, then read elsewhere that use of sustainable sources of palm oil was not the answer. Does anyone know reliable sources for latest info on #palmoil?
4719 2018-11-11 21:08:06 call the 4some register add me son, no ferrari please we cant smell olive oil
4720 2018-11-11 21:07:58 yellow cake mix. chocolate chips. half cup of oil. two eggs. 350 for about 10 min.
4721 2018-11-11 21:07:56 Halve the sprouts lengthways. Heat 2 tablespoons (or a good glug) of olive oil in a pan and fry the sprouts for about 7mins, until the outsides are crisp/brown. Toss in a bowl with some balsamic vinegar. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and chilli flakes and eat. Delicious!
4722 2018-11-11 21:07:43 A top 5 pick is an asset and an attractive piece.  The Jets need OL help and there will be quality interior linemen available.  The $100 million is an asset.  A POTENTIAL franchise QB is an asset.  Why would a coach worth his salt go to Dallas so an oil man can draft his players?
4723 2018-11-11 21:07:41 So is coconut oil over?
4724 2018-11-11 21:07:23 Every time I come get a oil change they always find something wrong with my car.  like I just wanted a oil change...
4725 2018-11-11 21:07:20 A saltwater sprinkler system should be installed threw the state for emergencies. We can pipe oil, then we can pipe water.
4726 2018-11-11 21:07:20 To buy make-up kits and coconut, carrot or sugarcane oil. Soon na engine oil...
4727 2018-11-11 21:07:18 Had to look it up. Good on Iceland. Huge action on palm oil front. Type of move that would get me to shop there. Thanks for sharing.
4728 2018-11-11 21:07:11 Good luck sweetie! If you don't notice anything right away give it a good 2-3 weeks for your body to fully react to CBD Oil. Keep me updated sweetie!
4729 2018-11-11 21:06:55 @IcelandFoods I went to your store for the first time yesterday as looking for #PalmOil free bread and your own bread still has palm in it! I thought your own brand products were meant to be palm free? Was so disappointed as desperate to find a palm oil free loaf.  #vegan
4730 2018-11-11 21:06:46 Oil burns on the nipples is a good look.
4731 2018-11-11 21:06:38 @WolfensPride I explain to you. All our trades working. Oil up. Gas up. Chinese money down
4732 2018-11-11 21:06:35 half a drop good oil cologne is more than enough.
4733 2018-11-11 21:06:32 Trump/Zinke want to destroy historical records on endangered species,  marine conservation, oil and gas leases, mining, dams, critical habitats, land acquisitions, etc. These should be archived, not destroyed.
4734 2018-11-11 21:06:21 Fucking around with bat he had me late for work I sipped some of that oil and blew some gas gas & overslept
4735 2018-11-11 21:06:21 Why does is look like sun and oil came to visit?
4736 2018-11-11 21:06:15 Your country didn't need defending,  it wasn't under attack.  He was used as a weapon to secure cheap oil for political reasons
4737 2018-11-11 21:06:14 dude! the most underrated hov song!!
kills me when he raps about lifting the whole hood like it got oil under it
4738 2018-11-11 21:06:14 I wish Iceland had as much compassion for those with Down’s syndrome as for orangutans. In addition to removing palm oil from their products, they have removed people with Trisomy 21 from their population.
4739 2018-11-11 21:06:12 Where did I mention palm oil sir? I'm tackling their cases spiritually maybe their ancestors are withholding their beards we may never know until they come for consultation
4740 2018-11-11 21:06:08 Why’d she put her hands in the oil tho 
4741 2018-11-11 21:06:00 no way if you still buying their oil
4742 2018-11-11 21:05:57 I like to fry some bacon, and roast the sprouts in the leftover bacon fat, and olive oil, salt and pepper. When done I toss the bacon in and toss them with apple balsamic vinegar. Yummy!
4743 2018-11-11 21:05:56 But every time I can slither my way out of it cuz I’m slicker than an oil can
4744 2018-11-11 21:05:54 We can still extract the oil na.. Using soxhlet method 
4745 2018-11-11 21:05:31 Ps 133:2: It is like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down on Aaron’s beard, down upon the collar of his robes.
4746 2018-11-11 21:05:22 I wonder how many people check to see if products they buy from a variety of corporations are connected to forced labor (slavery often of children) in industries such as palm oil, coffee, technologies, garments, cocoa (2/3 global supply harvested by African child slaves)?
4747 2018-11-11 21:05:19 See oil moni
4748 2018-11-11 21:05:19 Why? Oil is a commodity that should be priced by market mechanism rather than by manipulation or in this case, non-sense wishes.
4749 2018-11-11 21:05:14 I have spent decades working offshore around all sorts of oil and gas installations and in open waters watching divers and ROVs on camera. The most sea life I have ever seen has always been close to oil and gas infrastructure. I don't know why but it is an indisputable fact.
4750 2018-11-11 21:05:00 I sure hope we start off with a win tonight, score the first goal, tough on the PP, PK and puck retrievals, timely goaltending, if we do this we can win. If not we could be out of the playoffs this time next week. Go Oil! I will be glued to the tube tonight!
4751 2018-11-11 21:04:59 You could use olive oil if you wanted. But garlic butter is literally just garlic mixed with butter. No big mystery about it. Have you had toast before? It's just the same, with garlic
4752 2018-11-11 21:04:54 Motor Mouse is running too hot, reduce the oil, so she too can burn down!
4753 2018-11-11 21:04:51 Totally outrageous, such kind animals, these are caring and thinking animals like us just look in their eyes, what is wrong with these villagers and why are we buying anything with palm oil.
4754 2018-11-11 21:04:47 All I’m wondering is why she felt the need to take a picture of the drain plug and the old oil? Like she obviously just dabbed her fingers in there like “oh this’ll look good”.
4755 2018-11-11 21:04:41 If you call global recession of 2008 and crude oil price >100 usd per barrel cosy, you delusional.
4756 2018-11-11 21:04:38 "Didn't see me did you?"

Actually, Blake sweetie, I did see you. I just didn't have enough aura to send out my Weiss to stop you from destroying my tower that had 76 health with 7 seconds left.

4759 2018-11-11 21:04:13 I've read that Iceland's products are fairly palm oil heavy too but I can't find the evidence so this may not be an actual fact
4760 2018-11-11 21:03:44 Let's ban Palm oil instead! I try not to buy products with palm oil and micro plastics anymore.
#BanPalmOil #BanMicroPlastics

Ich versuche momentan, wenn möglich keine Produkte zu kaufen, die Mikroplastik oder Palmöl enthalten. Gehört einfach verboten, das wäre am effektivsten!
4761 2018-11-11 21:03:44 Well Merkle just screwed Putin on oil and macron is shaking in his boots. Trump has no skin in the game. I'd laugh too.
4762 2018-11-11 21:03:43 Um lotion n baby oil ?
4763 2018-11-11 21:03:41 I’m inspired by jack sparrow, let me just hijack an oil tanker ..
4764 2018-11-11 21:03:39 In honor of palm oil deforestation and the California fires that destroyed my parents' home, I'm only reading about trees from here on out
4765 2018-11-11 21:03:38 REDUCE-IT used 4 grams of purified EPA that is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. VITAL used 1 gram of fish oil (not even 1 gram of EPA)
4766 2018-11-11 21:03:36 I think you've touched on part of what's  going wrong w/ climate policy debates. There's a temptation to blame either energy consumers (e.g. drivers, home owners) or producers (e.g. oil & gas).  Neither makes sense; the energy supply & demand system is exactly that, a system. 1/n
4767 2018-11-11 21:03:20 Not from Day 1, but after getting look in 16/17 seeing that he wasn’t producing & needed more time, should’ve sent him down well before Jan 2017 when he was a freq healthy scratch. Same could be said for last year when he wasn’t getting Top 6F/PP time. Dragged out this yr too.
4768 2018-11-11 21:03:17 Yes, and that starts with reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and the best way to do that is to wean America off of oil, coal, and gas. Of course you won't do that because those industries pay you to try and keep them relevant.
4769 2018-11-11 21:03:15 You mean in the same way it is now with Oil? 
Also due to its high cost won’t solar and wind still be competitive?
4770 2018-11-11 21:03:02 You expropriate "democracy" in the states with oil. sure!
4771 2018-11-11 21:02:57 They're always out of favor when ground forces get into Hama's, a lot of KIA when they intrude.
4772 2018-11-11 21:02:53 A foot rub with peppermint oil would be so A-1
4773 2018-11-11 21:02:22 "The controls were put in place by the Nixon and Ford administrations in reaction to a jump in fuel prices caused by cuts in production by the newly formed international oil cartel, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries."
4774 2018-11-11 21:02:01 My face is numb bcos of tea tree oil
4775 2018-11-11 21:01:45 I hope you all stay in CA and you secede and create your own govt and support.  Get rid of your straws and your oil and your plastic then increase taxes and out of site pensions and then sit around and watch all the movie stars tell you it’s great.  We will be fine East if you.
4776 2018-11-11 21:01:40 I repeat; I'd trust Holyrood to manage remaining oil reserves - that are needed during a period of transition - more than Westminster.
4777 2018-11-11 21:01:28 I think the guns and mercenaries in exchange for oil trade, in place since 1973, is unraveling.  Rather, has been, but is exposed and accelerating now.
4778 2018-11-11 21:01:25 WHY WOULD YOU TAKE IT TO GET A OIL CHANGE WHEN ME AND COLBY ARE YOUR BESTFRIENDS?!
4779 2018-11-11 21:01:03 Hell the whole middle east is shitty situation. Israel and Saudi plotting, Turkey denying their atrocities, and the other countries having wars started by the Saudi backed terror and Israeli backed anti terror. The middle east would be nice without oil economy and religion.
4780 2018-11-11 21:00:58 Ogx renewing plus argan morocan oil shampoo
4781 2018-11-11 21:00:57 don’t the mexican cartels tap oil pipelines all the time? they must be pretty big on activism
4782 2018-11-11 21:00:51 Never seen garlic butter, didn't even know anything other than normal butter, margarine and sugna(pig fat) existed as form of butter.
Seems like butter is really loved outside italy... Here's all about that sweet sweet olive oil.
4783 2018-11-11 21:00:44 Lol! True. Anyway, now that we got waiver for Iranian oil and Chabahar, I think he refused the invite due to Delhi air quality and long air travel which many point out he hates.
4784 2018-11-11 21:00:33 Breaking news : jokes about American,democracy and oil are back ! 
Seize them while they are still fresh, you can even reuse the one from the gulf wars nobody learned anyway.

4790 2018-11-11 21:00:01 Local businesses are becoming more innovative to keep up with higher demands thanks to the oil boom. “It’s a problem a lot of cities in New Mexico would love to have.”
4791 2018-11-11 20:59:53 People in Lucas Oil are cheering cuz the Titians are beating the Patriots ? I’m confused
4792 2018-11-11 20:59:49 Why is everyone so paranoid about oil pipes?  The new tech allows monitoring for problems much better.
4793 2018-11-11 20:59:47 @HHShkMohd @WildeSabbath HE CAN MAKE LITTLE ROUND BALLS OF OIL AND OTHER DEBRI AS CLOGGED VEINS ALSO, AT WILL WITH CHI LIFE FORCE ENERGY SO GET YOUR DONKEYS TO AN ACUPUNCTURIST IF YOU DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THAT HAPPENS TO YOU AND NOT TO OTHERS LIKE BUDDHISTS
4794 2018-11-11 20:59:44 Babe just go full 70’s. That or get yourself some extra virgin olive oil. It’s a fab moisturiser. X
4795 2018-11-11 20:59:41 Nigerians, this is d progress report from Julius Berger on the 2nd Niger Bridge they didn’t want you to see. For 16 yrs when price of crude oil was high, this project was just a drawing on a table! Now, in just a short time under PMB, see for yourself! My Igbo brothers, think!
4796 2018-11-11 20:59:40 Oil money. The bad news is that it will run out in 20-30 years and then you will go back to be part of the relegation battle year after year
4797 2018-11-11 20:59:39 Roasted (the only way to eat them) with olive oil, course salt, pepper, and bacon! So yum.
4798 2018-11-11 20:59:37 A new comfortable pillow ?and some CBD oil .( As mentioned before by Zoey) Good luck 
4799 2018-11-11 20:59:36 @LushLtd Please can you confirm that you don’t source any of your ingredients from palm oil or its derivatives please? Thanks!
4800 2018-11-11 20:59:30 Iceland's ad is brilliant not just because it raises awareness of the destructive effect of unsustainable palm oil but also because us humans often have the cheek to talk about other animals being a nuisance to us. Good to see the story flipped the other way.
4801 2018-11-11 20:59:26 State backed, oil bought, corruption
4802 2018-11-11 20:59:19 Her hands too clean for her to have changed her own oil lol unless she washed em first but I feel this cap 
4803 2018-11-11 20:59:18 Over cascades oil over my boots should av never gone out on it highsided only remember the thud as i landed head first then got run over of a mint r6 ooops
4804 2018-11-11 20:59:11 Maybe so BUT we have TOO much of our own #oil that is driving prices below producer's costs that we really don't need to add to that Canada's dirty #Oilsands.

4805 2018-11-11 20:59:05 Man I lubed it AND changed the oil. .

4808 2018-11-11 20:58:54 Nice, but I’m an always cold female (& our oil bill is always evil)
4809 2018-11-11 20:58:45 Makes me almost want to wrap a t-shirt around my hair, liberally apply Egyptian musk oil, and offer to wash and twist a young ladies locs
4810 2018-11-11 20:58:43 I brought the oil back dam
4811 2018-11-11 20:58:39 Ok let me address this. You mention oil reserves, oil has to be $90-100$ a barrel to break even, it's not hit $90 since 2014. Whisky, 5% of 2017 uk gdp, but only last year. Fishing? Under EU CFP The French, Dutch, Danes, and Spanish catch most of the Fish in your waters.
4812 2018-11-11 20:58:32 If we ban/restrict anyone it needs to be the Wahhabis Saudi scum. But alas, Oil/Money is a strong relationship to break apparantly.
4813 2018-11-11 20:58:25 It's beats Kevin the fucking carrot. I saw it before it was ever a banned ad, and it's good. I think it's important. I will probably never shop in Iceland, but I admire their efforts re palm oil when so many stores don't give a shit.
4814 2018-11-11 20:58:12 and then all of the sudden my face was splattered with THC oil.
4815 2018-11-11 20:58:05 Asamu addua pls
4816 2018-11-11 20:58:02 @JoshManMode FYI, Im really thrown off with oil right now.Equity analysts blaming potential bear market in oil as a 1:1 correlation with current equity market conditions?Really?they weren't chirping when market was soaring a few years back when oil hovered 30 per barrell
4817 2018-11-11 20:57:57 Excellent distinction!

On that point, if I may add into the mix, it is worth considering what might have happened had those virgins gone on to meet the bridegroom anyway, without lit lamps, instead of going to the market to buy oil.
4818 2018-11-11 20:57:39 Oil free y primer despues
4819 2018-11-11 20:57:35 Hilarious. Please show this same post in 2 months. Nothing will have happened. Yes, Iraq exports oil for money. The exchange rate is 1190. Doesn’t matter if it’s oil, cookies, beer, etc. that’s what the IQD is with folks. Don’t listen to these idiots. Gurus make $, u never will.
4820 2018-11-11 20:57:34 My moma ain’t took none of her pain medication is about a week thanks to this cbd oil. Now all of a sudden she wanna have talks about how useful marijuana can be

4822 2018-11-11 20:57:14 Better/worse than other countries is meaningless. Doing what the science demands is all that matters. The SNP are committed to extracting as much oil & gas from North Sea as possible & are setting targets weaker than what the IPCC or Paris (which we signed up to) demand.
4823 2018-11-11 20:56:58 So many oil industry trolls and sock puppets in this thread that can go read book instead of displaying their personal greed vs the entire human race.

4824 2018-11-11 20:56:57 MBS is working with Xi and Putin. Petrodollar is at risk bc Xi will use gold backed yuan to buy oil and russia and MBS are working on a deal to stabilize oil prices.
4825 2018-11-11 20:56:49 but can u replace my oil pan
4826 2018-11-11 20:56:30 my car broke down n my dads real life blaming it on my boyfriend he said “that mf never told u to check ur oil??”
4827 2018-11-11 20:56:27 I didnt see this, am asleep
4828 2018-11-11 20:56:17 Correct! Palm oil uses up to 30x less space than other oils if we are going by quantity produced per km. Boycotting completely is dangerous as we’d be switching to plants that need larger areas to cope with demand.
4829 2018-11-11 20:56:14 My friend just said 

I think it's high time NNPC contracts the digging of oil well to Manchester United, this one they are going down bayi, when do you think they  will discover the oil?

4837 2018-11-11 20:55:20 don’t get me wrong, im buzzing people are acknowledging plastic and palm oil use and educating themselves on the environment.. but please factor in your meat and dairy consumption too

4839 2018-11-11 20:55:16 How many on the list approve of the military-industrial oil hunting machine that they served ?
4840 2018-11-11 20:55:12 Lemme write this last lil paragraph for this paper, eat, take some CBD oil & relax for the rest of the day. Might even read a book because I won’t have anything school related to do 
4841 2018-11-11 20:55:10 We need some oil money definitely.
Scrap the defense, the midfield, the attack
4842 2018-11-11 20:55:09 I got cross about the consequences of the use of palm oil about 8 years ago and have been banging on about it to anyone who’d listen ever since. So they’re preaching to the converted here.
4843 2018-11-11 20:55:05 Rees-Mogg is right about one thing - vassal status. Not a major problem for a primarily oil, gas and fishing economy like Norway, but a major long term disadvantage for our economy. Additionally we'd need to be in the CU - so more vassal status.
4844 2018-11-11 20:55:00 To be fair, still not sold on the notion the kid has needed to be the AHL from Day One but no question the route they took did Puljujarvi no favours. The moment it became clear a T6 role was in the cards, it should have been time doe the AHL.

Grapeseed oil did wonders on my ex boyfriend's skin. Ngiyay'vuma.
4846 2018-11-11 20:54:58 Sounds like a strategy... Turkey doing crossborder-attacks and luring SDF out of the oil-rich south-east... so SAA will cross euphrates near Abu Kamal and finish off isis. Without isis US will have no more excuse to stay and without the oil fields one Interest less
4847 2018-11-11 20:54:56 hi ya Julia,I have to say I didn't know much about palm oil until I google it and was shocked,what prompted me to google it @IcelandFoods banned Christmas ad,so thank you @IcelandFoods
4848 2018-11-11 20:54:54 Why are Oil changes soo expensive 
4849 2018-11-11 20:54:54 Lmao do you know how to change your oil? Prolly not but go off. Most girls can’t change their own oil , she does it herself instead of paying more to have it done. She’s SMART.

4852 2018-11-11 20:54:23 Can we mention what we all know City are cheating with oil money I dare ya
4853 2018-11-11 20:53:46 First coat of oil on the door! Stuff is coming together 
4854 2018-11-11 20:53:34 If Macron and the EU see Putin and Russia as a possible 
Threat to their liberty they need to tell Germany to stop buying Russia’s Gas and Oil at discounted prices.
Just another con in the EU.
4855 2018-11-11 20:53:30 Did you know that Saudi Arabia will not accept payment for oil in US dollars any longer?? GOLD and #BitCoin are the future folks.

4862 2018-11-11 20:52:10 Remember Collins was Energy Minister at the time she did nothing about petrol prices and oil company competition from her Claytons Inquiry and conveniently the broken pipeline investigation came to a quick inconclusive end no one was charged for millions of dollars in losses
4863 2018-11-11 20:52:02 Boiling in oil.
4864 2018-11-11 20:52:01 The point is its not in your place to dictate how they use their land and their oil. Use your own resources and stay in your landlocked biafra
4865 2018-11-11 20:52:00 交渉の世界では、「相手にわかってほしい。察してほしい。」などと相手に過度の寛容を求めて仕事することは、相手に大きな借りを作ることに繋がる。

トランプは非上場企業の親玉の様なものなので、随分寛容に聴く努力をしているように感じた。
4866 2018-11-11 20:51:49 Scam? Most herbal, internet, "it worked for me" or other type stuff that pull in desperate, gullible people to spend their money, give them hope and then not work or make things worse.
In the really old days, the scammers would be called "Snake oil salesmen".
4867 2018-11-11 20:51:46 OPEC sheikhs & oligarchs as well as US producers must piss themselves laughing when they read such comments from folks wanting to hobble our energy sector. Those tankers carrying "progressive" Saudi oil arrive in Montreal fuelled by fairy dust - if you didn't know.
4868 2018-11-11 20:51:29 @MontyBojangles is the palm kernel oil in your chocs from a sustainable source?
4869 2018-11-11 20:51:27 I will say though that googling "a vat of" yielded an entertaining smorgasbord of vats people fall into: chocolate, acid, red curry, oil, molten steel, etc
4870 2018-11-11 20:51:19 I am sure that due to nuclear arsenals there won’t be another war on a large scale unless we plan on eradicating life on earth. We need to look forward. Together. Russia isn’t he biggest threat to peace. Greed is and conducting proxy wars to ensure that oil and goods flow.
4871 2018-11-11 20:51:19 Reps summon NNPC GMD, 2 firms over ‘missing’ N91trn oil revenue.

How can a whooping N91 Trillions that is about 10-year annual budget of this country be missing?
This government is worse than anything we have seen as government in this country.

4872 2018-11-11 20:51:05 On my radar for this week are some oil names. $PBF and $FANG. Already in a $PBF Iron Butterfly. Positive seasonality should return with news from Saudi Arabia and oil producers they are cutting production to reduce glut
4873 2018-11-11 20:50:55 Plantains fresh out the oil >>
4874 2018-11-11 20:50:50 Nothing political about this Short besides corporations that use Palm Oil getting their panties in a knot!

4876 2018-11-11 20:50:14 Can’t help but wonder how many people watching and retweeting the Iceland advert will actually start thinking about their palm oil use and making changes? It’s no good writing about how powerful the ad is for retweets and not actually switching products to make a difference.
4877 2018-11-11 20:50:14 Win Jan canola up A$1.90/t & EU rape up A$6.42. More positive news towards resolving the US/China trade dispute. Support despite bearish USDA report for soybns that saw US stocks lifted. Canola up despite weaker palm oil & soyoil.

#oil #oilprice #markets #ausbiz #aufindaily
4879 2018-11-11 20:50:07 I seem to remember the switch to palm oil was to prevent another resource being used that was damaging the environment? It's like a chain of destruction. The truth is, we need to use less resources. God knows how we accomplish that.

4882 2018-11-11 20:49:57 Out of curiosity how low do you think oil goes? Thanks
4883 2018-11-11 20:49:56 Meeting an old friend for coffee this morning. We first met nearly 30 years ago in the oilfields of East Kalimantan. I went on to travel the world with the Oil Biz and he started a Software Company. You can imagine the stories we can both tell

4886 2018-11-11 20:49:33 @TescoIrl many of your crackers and confectionery contain palm oil, are you addressing this? Perhaps you could adopt a similar approach to @IcelandFoods

4898 2018-11-11 20:48:11 Ireland and Ukraine are part of the west in terms of values and histories. What we are talking about is ideological oil and water. Look up the doctrine of Dar al harb vs Dar al Islam. There must be far less ignorance and false equivalency arguments on this topic.
4899 2018-11-11 20:48:11 These people will do anything for control of land, oil and in this case, the additional seaports.
4900 2018-11-11 20:48:06 No. An ad hominem attack would be pointing out that Cotton is a Harvard-educated corporate lawyer wholly owned by Wall Street & big oil lobbies.

4902 2018-11-11 20:47:59 @CadburyIreland why do you still use palm oil in your Irish products?

4904 2018-11-11 20:47:53 It was clear that with oil down those days they needed to made up something to back it up at this latest levels...
I had 0 doubt some event incoming as history always remains the same...
4905 2018-11-11 20:47:47 Oil & vinegar on sandwiches is so delicious I’m actually furious I went 21 years without this knowledge
4906 2018-11-11 20:47:38 Amazing point. Tons of players in the palm oil industry use unethical means of obtaining it, do keep and mind some companies do reasonable source it (usually a large price difference though)
4907 2018-11-11 20:47:09 They were though. Lets leave the only thing that allows us to trade. When we as a contry has no oil mines. No production factorys. And are only infrastructure is call centres. All the uk is good at is telling other countrys what to do. And thats what we should have kept doing.

4914 2018-11-11 20:45:25 Oh no! You can work nicely with oil too! But it takes forever to dry!  Also, I hope you have a nice ventilated area. D: I think that's a must!
4915 2018-11-11 20:45:19 Cut in half and roasted. When done , drizzle with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper.
4916 2018-11-11 20:45:15 I don’t understand how it’s banned because it’s too political. Yet @jdwetherspoon chairman can spout pro-brexit anti-European dribble in his advertising but that’s not political? Then again this benefits the Tories as does the  palm oil industry any negative news could effect ££
4917 2018-11-11 20:45:12 And where is your evidence that there is so much oil in the North Sea that it will help to sustain an Independent Scotland?  I believe in indyref1 it was stated by Sturgeoun that there was enough for many years of sustainability but that was an actual lie and was proven so
4918 2018-11-11 20:45:08 Gotta go get my oil changed ASAP
4919 2018-11-11 20:45:05 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
4920 2018-11-11 20:44:59 Yes, unfortunately it's really down to the Government issuing the licence - next week would be good - massive Oil & Gas conference in Tanzania next week and the GOV want to encourage investment, a good time to issue licences :)

4931 2018-11-11 20:43:43 I’ve been putting getting my oil changed off for so long maybe my car will just blow up that would be tight
4932 2018-11-11 20:43:43 Maybe do a bit of research into the incentives and tax credits around the oil and gas industry before you decide that green jobs are the only ones funded by the government. We have spent billions to bring them here.

4951 2018-11-11 20:41:13 Yep. In Vegas, when it rains, the oil comes up out of the asphalt. Its like driving on black ice. So of course most people speed up.

4960 2018-11-11 20:39:54 I use the rejuvenique oil from @MONATOfficial - it’s hella expensive but a little goes a long way. The night before shampoo day (I only wash my hair twice a week) I put the oil on my scalp and let it sit overnight. Works like a charm.

4977 2018-11-11 20:37:35 Yes! I love these two  I love how chilled out they’ve been throughout their renovation, apart from the time @dickstrawbridge lost his shit turning an oil tank into a pig roaster by shouting obscenities into it  #EscapeToTheChateau
4978 2018-11-11 20:37:32 @realdonaldtrump made a campaign decision on delaying the Keystone Pipeline to 2013.The pipeline would lower oil prices and create jobs.
4979 2018-11-11 20:37:28 put mct oil in my coffee... it tastes like butter but it’s also really gooood????????????????????
4980 2018-11-11 20:37:25 Snake oil wonderfulness. Sure! I'll buy it!
4981 2018-11-11 20:37:07 @stoolpresidente Brady running looked like the tin man begging for oil
4982 2018-11-11 20:36:50 Oil , onion , (garlic , ginger , Harri Mirchein Grind Kar ke ) salt , red chilies ,  haldi + Payee + water close cooker when pressure built then let it cook 30 minutes atleast afterwards open cooker adjust water if it’s less cook on medium heat for 1-2 hrs at the end garam Masala
4983 2018-11-11 20:36:46 It's a pity they couldn't use a gun and shoot the cunts who are destroying there forest or trying to kill them for Pam oil
4984 2018-11-11 20:36:36 Britain appears 8 times and the UK 4 times with British being used once. Even Norway gets a mention as does Shetland but there is no place for who the oil actually belongs to.
4985 2018-11-11 20:36:27 Lol MOOOOD! I bought a new oil last week and literally can’t stop sniffing myself
4986 2018-11-11 20:36:18 Might be so but i see more oil city fans nowadays why is that? Yes gloryhunters! 10 years ago city was nowhere mate
4987 2018-11-11 20:36:14 @UmaruSanda Sanda., Senyo Hosi of the Transport ministry board chairman..is he the same as Senyo Horsi is Bulk Oil Distribution Company?
4988 2018-11-11 20:36:05 45-47% of global oil production is processed to gasoline and consumed by cars. The recent 20% decline in price of oil is related to demand or supply concerns ?
4989 2018-11-11 20:35:42 So Indy certain in the foreseeable future or after the oil runs out?
4990 2018-11-11 20:35:40 Time for the weekly Stu Feiner is a Snake Oil Salesmen tweet. @StuSource is 22-27 on NFL games ATS so far this year  dude acts like he’s hitting at 60% when in reality he is hitting at 45%. I wouldn’t trust him with a dime of mine. Meanwhile I’m 67-46 this year in CFB
4991 2018-11-11 20:35:27 Right.  We have it all, and beauty and great resources of gold, natural gas and oil, and a world-supplier of food.
4992 2018-11-11 20:35:23 But they did a whole tv series called Oil Change
4993 2018-11-11 20:35:22 Perfect weekend really.

City win and Utd and Bayern lose. 

Take the L David Gill, take the L Rumeniegge and Houness. The Sheikhs "oil" money is continuing to boil some serious amounts of piss.
4994 2018-11-11 20:35:18 First rule of asking a Big Oil Co questions is to have the answers first. 

I've got 'em. 

We ready.
4995 2018-11-11 20:35:16 I'll be a contrarian and say I don't believe the fake government figures. Looking at the Big Mac index or Chapwood index, Inflation is real. PPI now pushing 2012 highs, mostly due to oil prices. Low rates have fueled commodity growth and low prices, but that will change now.
4996 2018-11-11 20:35:11 I'm not up on this but I know there was some sort of me mechanism in some cases, both oil and gas, air was sucked in from surrounding holes and fuel came from the centre. I hoped you knew 
4997 2018-11-11 20:34:57 Facts on Mexico are completely off. Crime doesn't currently control production and the fact that avo exports beat oil are due to a poor oil production.
4998 2018-11-11 20:34:53 warm chamomile tea does help alot of people too.. and lavender oil on a tissue under your pillow was a classic that my boarding house mistress uses to get for us in grade 7. may be silly hooha but for some people it does the trick! i hope you find a solution
4999 2018-11-11 20:34:51 @Dove Hey there! Our family are trying to dramatically reduce the amount of palm oil based products we use! Where can I find information about what is used in your products?
5000 2018-11-11 20:34:50 While ludicrous that it was banned, it thankfully has done them a favour. We flew to Oz via Kuala Lumpur back in ‘04. The sight we saw flying over the Malaysian rainforest cut down and replaced with trees for palm oil horrified us. #timeforchange
5001 2018-11-11 20:34:49 Shorty changing her oil and brakes? Lol I rather pay someone for the convenience but do your thing shorty
5002 2018-11-11 20:34:45 Yes, me too! Have learned so much about palm oil since the release of the @IcelandFoods advert. Sustainably sourced palm oil appears to be the way forward. Great that we're all engaging and talking about it. Very complex subject.
5003 2018-11-11 20:34:41 This oil I got on now 
5004 2018-11-11 20:34:36 because of mineral oil?
5005 2018-11-11 20:34:34 Look no further than Canada's oil industry to see what damage these socialists can do. Fight them now before they destroy the Aussy economy!

5010 2018-11-11 20:33:49 Yes of course the Westminster government,  that won't subsidise a spare bedroom , will fight tooth and nail to keep a country that is a massive drain on the rest of the country . Got nothing to do with the oil reserves , fishing waters , whisky exports , etc .

5012 2018-11-11 20:33:23 @Aldi_Ireland @lidl_ireland Isn't it about time everyone followed @IcelandFoods example and stopped using palm oil in own brand products #NoPalmOilChristmas
5013 2018-11-11 20:33:15 There's an oil spill off the coast of the US that's been going on since 2004. That's mad.
5014 2018-11-11 20:33:12 It wasn't censored. That's the standard for broadcasting and rightly so. We don't want the EDL sharing propaganda through ALDI or something either.
Palm oil farming is a problem. Most goes to fuels. People should learn more but this isn't a great way. Just Iceland pr.
5015 2018-11-11 20:32:59 Essentially true, the gov (WM) sell drilling rights for specific areas, the company that buys the rights then own the oil extracted in that area and giv get the tax.
5016 2018-11-11 20:32:58 This is sweet. I hope you are using oil filled motors too. It may not sound the same but hoping it will at least start dripping oil after a few years just like the older myself.  Jokes aside. Nice job.
5017 2018-11-11 20:32:57 But you can’t argue that city spend too much because they’re oil rich. That just means they have a good owner. Uniteds recent years of downward spirals have come from within. Moyes, Van Gaal. Ed.
5018 2018-11-11 20:32:52 The energy and oil industry died because Trudeau actually said that is what he wants to do. He is bankrupting Canada, so that Soros, the Globalists, the U.N., and maybe even a dictatorships, like Iran, can take over. How much is Trudeau being paid to do this? #RNWO
5019 2018-11-11 20:32:48 More oil than the whole of Saudi Arabia
5020 2018-11-11 20:32:41 Can't Rick Scott just retire and go back to being frontman for Midnight Oil?
5021 2018-11-11 20:32:29 So during my research for our aphrodisiac syrup, a friend drew my attention to Samsu oil. I went through it, its just a 4ml ginger oil. . The power of well crafted herbs. Was originally introduced as a sore muscle rub. Have you tried Samsu oil?  Tell us your experience
5022 2018-11-11 20:32:17 It’s linked to the fact that clearcast’s bankers have skin in the palm oil game. @nw_nicholas

5031 2018-11-11 20:31:25 I wish that ad could run! Palm oil deforestation has long been a big issue, but has never cracked the mainstream—but not for lack of trying
5032 2018-11-11 20:31:20 Oil of every pearls uninsides amazes me every time i listen to it
5033 2018-11-11 20:31:00 I didn’t intend to offend but felt they need to get off Ades back. Constructive criticism is OK but the ongoing abuse is entirely unacceptable to the majority on here. All investors trade any advantage they can get, as will they. Investors are responsible for their own decisions.
5034 2018-11-11 20:30:52 I have a farm in Lusaka, Zambia and have been growing maize which is unprofitable. I would love to venture into chili farming and eventually start processing chili oil for export. Is there a way I can be assisted by out or any organisation? Thanking you in advance

5048 2018-11-11 20:28:44 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Please share to @PrideToronto why you want the world to buy #bloodoil  obstructing Trans Mountain = killing #LGBTQ

5050 2018-11-11 20:28:40 I like them plain. Boiled briefly and then covered in garlic infused oil with lots of salt and then baked until just starting to blacken. Best with sour cream and potatoes

5059 2018-11-11 20:28:11 The capsaicin is fat and alcohol soluble. I’ve had decent luck rubbing vegetable oil over the burning spot then washing with soap. But I’m not confident it would work, as it was years ago and my memory is fuzzy.
5060 2018-11-11 20:27:51 I want an oil diffuser and some candles from bath and body works.
5061 2018-11-11 20:27:40 Yep shocking
5062 2018-11-11 20:27:18 Yeah that may be but they dont need to advertise there intent to refuse palm oil in products, if the company truly cared as opposed to striking a deal to produce more sales they wouldn’t need to advertise it .. that being said it shouldent be banned

5066 2018-11-11 20:26:58 If they're not cutting up Journalists they're cutting oil production.
5067 2018-11-11 20:26:55 I trim them, cut them in half lengthwise, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle salt, pepper and parmesan cheese on, then roast at 400 for about 30-40 mins, turning every 15 mins until brown and crispy. Once out of the oven, I like to sprinkle a bit of lemon zest on them too.
5068 2018-11-11 20:26:47 @walkers_crisps do you use palm oil?  Do you agree with the Iceland ad?

5072 2018-11-11 20:26:21 @JeremyECrawford when oil is applied to a creature from a flask of oil does the creature take the extra five damage each time it takes fire damage for a minute(the time it takes for the oil to dry) or only the first time?
5073 2018-11-11 20:26:10 Independence from foreign oil would fantastic I agree but there still remains the factor that oil and gas will perhaps always undermine renewable energy price wise but hopefully the cost will go down.. let the market decide, the more options available the better for the consumer.
5074 2018-11-11 20:26:09 Those early goals

5078 2018-11-11 20:25:54 @CrackerBarrel The food was very disappointing. The bisquits & gravy were mediocre & the hash brown casserole was horrible. I was so excited to eat at Cracker Barrel. The waitress was horrible too. I asked her 3 separate times to light the oil lamp  and she didn't!
5079 2018-11-11 20:25:52 Setting Powder: absorbs excess oil, moisture and shine from either your face or products you've used.

5083 2018-11-11 20:25:12 bacon and brussel sprouts is my 5 year old's favorite food. Cut brussel sprouts in half, and put into a bowl, toss with avocado oil. Cut raw bacon into squares, and mix with BS, add salt and pepper to taste. Spread out on cooking sheet and cook at 450 for 30 min. mix at 15

5085 2018-11-11 20:24:31 We were together at Toma South oil field before he met his Tragic death,he was very nice personality,he recognized other people contribution to his life,he told me of his Warwick sponsorship
5086 2018-11-11 20:24:27 It's quite ironic really. To the pundits City didn't even exist before the oil money and big spending but ,when they are asked to discuss said oil money, they happily shift the conversation on to avoid upsetting darling City and their completely inconspicuous rise to the top
5087 2018-11-11 20:24:19 I’m curious, do you know anything about CBD oil for dogs?! Is that toxic as well?! My baby girl has a torn ligament in her leg and I’ve considered starting her on the oil...
5088 2018-11-11 20:24:06 Stir in three liters of olive oil then lower the temperature.
5089 2018-11-11 20:23:39 Ah can anyone tell me the current price of barrel oil production in angola ($ to produce 1 barrel)
5090 2018-11-11 20:23:37 A very big one for @Total @TOTALNigeria .
Everyone is looking forward to the first oil by 30th of December.
5091 2018-11-11 20:23:33 RT @kmcApple: "Vitamin D and the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil are important nutrients"

None of that sounds disappointing to me.

5094 2018-11-11 20:23:06 I went thru the worst kind of pain ever for 12 hours straight bc I didn’t shave properly. When you shave:

• always use a body scrub BEFORE
• clean razor / or sanitize it in alcohol
• coconut oil as pre-shave
• shave downward NOT against the grain to reduce burns/irritation
5095 2018-11-11 20:23:01 But controlled by a central bank with a currency monopoly, and since 1971 or 73 IIRC has been less stable. Furthermore it is tied to the Saudi oil cartel which many are beginning to understand the conflict of interests.

5107 2018-11-11 20:21:44 I quote this daily, trying to convince the people I refer to as friends that oil has been the cause of every war in the last 100 years but alas they don't believe me. I think I need new friends
5108 2018-11-11 20:21:44 Even Jim Chanos said today on KCRW that he doesn’t understand why oil/gas is subsidized!!

5115 2018-11-11 20:20:57 My mother came to me in a dream to say sorry and to explain why she "had to go". But in leaving she gave me an oil lamp. The lamp would not go out as I tried to pack it up. When I woke I realized her message.

5116 2018-11-11 20:20:56 Snow here too.  Just in time for my truck to completely break down, my fuel oil heating system has failed, my basement is flooded, my Sicilian Lady Friend left after kicking me to the gutter, and most of the cats here came down with bird flu and died.  Sucks to be alone.
5117 2018-11-11 20:20:55 Yeah buh not to that of oil sauce
5118 2018-11-11 20:20:55 I’m surprised you’re suggesting to wait for regulations... Are you not afraid that it may be too late if everyone is waiting for regulations instead of pushing them forward? Or are you denying climate change and oil/Ice influence?
5119 2018-11-11 20:20:53 there is nothing that helps our national security more than independence from oil. The sooner we get there the sooner we will be bebolden to no one. The cost of alternate energy sources is steadily dropping and companies are buying.
5120 2018-11-11 20:20:52 2. Greenpeace is who made the orig video. Those profiting off dirty palm oil can't sanction activist content w/o blowback from shareholders

5129 2018-11-11 20:19:35 You can get longer nails by applying olive oil to help them grow.
5130 2018-11-11 20:19:23 I've been treating my hair with coconut oil and my curls have never been this been this soft before.
5131 2018-11-11 20:19:10 Yes, that’s what I use in my bread, Indian cooking and salad dressing too. Has higher burn temperature than olive oil too, so excellent for frying lightly.
5132 2018-11-11 20:18:58 Japan relies on Middle Eastern countries for about 90% of its oil imports.

5138 2018-11-11 20:18:16 Master trump & co need to accept one undeniable fact.

So Fram Oil filter -> "Pay me Now or Pay Me Later"
5139 2018-11-11 20:18:12 The greatest con in history: getting good people to give away blood for free so they can sell it and make a profit higher than the price of oil.

5148 2018-11-11 20:17:25 What exactly is the oil companies saying? Cause I haven’t heard anything having to do with climate change. All I hear from green energy is how evil oil is.
5149 2018-11-11 20:17:21 Sorry to hear that you don’t want to share your views about oil vs renewables investments to others than existing clients.

Good plan.
5156 2018-11-11 20:16:25 Say no to palm oil and any product that causes the destruction of forests and rain forests
5157 2018-11-11 20:16:21 1. "dirty" palm oil is a function of corporate profiteering and corrupt governments. they have everything to lose if people demand it stop

5159 2018-11-11 20:16:15 Mineral wealth eg oil is aeons of accumulated energy (a land-credit gifted in cosmological-ecological terms TO ALL as yet unborn) Our exploiting reserves in an infinitesimal-fraction period yields alarmingly high-interest rate on usury of our common home: $banking isn't "wealth."
5160 2018-11-11 20:15:55 Thank you so much for sharing this! I was a zookeeper for 11 years and try hard to educate people about the effects of palm oil production. This video is powerful. Hopefully it’s not too late for the orangutans and all the other species in those areas

5168 2018-11-11 20:15:06 Proper spaghetti sauce should have tomatoes, onions, garlic, basil, pepper, olive oil, cheese (parmesan or romano), and *maybe* minced green peppers. People who add other veggies are bastardizing the sauce! #MHO

5172 2018-11-11 20:14:52 There's a coming push on re-instituting the global oil draw, in order to reduce current inv lvls. A lack of clarity on IR impact, political pressure and pure opportunism, led to a loss of focus on this objective. With demand risk weighted 2 neg econ's, this will refocus efforts.

5192 2018-11-11 20:12:21 I just rub in some simple garlic salt and pepper, heat up a tiny bit of olive oil on a pan and sear every side for about 2 min each side. Then I stick them in the oven for about 5-10 more min depending on how rare you like the steak & let rest with some homemade garlic butter
5193 2018-11-11 20:12:11 Keep an eye on China. Cannabis is legal (industrial production only) and they are building out. Already the biggest producer of hemp in the world. Watch for a flood of CBD oil from China.

5200 2018-11-11 20:10:45 My favorite part of getting an oil change is when they invite me back to look at the air filter and ask if I’d like a new one as if I have any clue what the hell Im looking at.

5238 2018-11-11 20:07:03 Hey @RMBCPress, I tried to drop off an old bottle of engine oil at the tip today... was told to take it home and wash it out with warm soapy water. Not sure what @YorkshireWater would think about that sort of #pollution. No wonder we have #FlyTipping problems.
5239 2018-11-11 20:07:02 Milan have you actually been to Alberta? Or are you just preaching from the center of the world. As someone who has made a living in the patch I can tell you oil companies leave their locations in better shape then they were in before they were there.
5240 2018-11-11 20:07:01 Nice football from the corrupt oil money club.
5241 2018-11-11 20:06:52 please for the love of god stop buying things with palm oil included
5242 2018-11-11 20:06:47 Bugattis? Oil prices need to tank, imo.
5243 2018-11-11 20:06:45 Coconut oil can clog pores pretty badly, especially in people who have naturally oily skin! Other cheap oils that are good for those skin types are grape seed, olive, and sunflower!

5250 2018-11-11 20:06:10 Do you presently use cannabis sourced CBD oil for your dog?
5251 2018-11-11 20:06:03 So happy that you've gotten relief through cbd oil!
5252 2018-11-11 20:05:57 Good to see the President’s staffers trying to pour oil on stormy waters! Stop covering for him and stand up to him!!!
5253 2018-11-11 20:05:57 Not to worry, Mr. Dressup (our PM) understands the importance of a pipeline to get our oil to market at a fair price.
5254 2018-11-11 20:05:45 My dad had the audacity to ask me if I knew how to change my oil........
5255 2018-11-11 20:05:44 That’s right. Oil should be used to created our renewable energy infrastructure.  When that it is done we can use renewables to sustain it. Arguing to keep using oil is like arguing to bring back whaling for oil. It is outdated and propped up by greedy corporations.
5256 2018-11-11 20:05:11 Some of y'all really are crazy!

Stop trying to downplay CBD oil....don't nobody wanna get high!
We take CBD oil for pain..also this can be given to kids for autism...
So please stop with the bs comments.

Just cause you like to get high don't mean that the next person does.
5257 2018-11-11 20:05:11 Reckon @neilmullen07 is gonna need an oil tanker to store the bites he's getting on here this evening. Good work Captain! Reel 'em in!

5264 2018-11-11 20:03:23 Soo disappointed wz the results We are getting now.
Arsenal directors shld sell the club to oil money sheikhs so that they put in the cash.
Why shld we remain the same old arsenal.
5265 2018-11-11 20:03:14 Watch out for oil?
5266 2018-11-11 20:03:01 let's all honor Remembrance Day by not sending people to war unless we're actually in danger* and we've exhausted all other options.

(*our oil supply doesn't count.)
5267 2018-11-11 20:02:59 False.  The ONLY way to honor our service men and women is to #bringTheTroopsHome.    Instead this war monger happily sends them to die for oil and central banks. 
5268 2018-11-11 20:02:55 Someone compared trump's presidency to a car alarm that never shuts off
after awhile everyone ignores it meanwhile the car is being robbed, stripped, there will be nothing left of it but an oil stain.

5270 2018-11-11 20:02:50 Fore-fathers fought for inter-family squabble (ww1), a banker-funded socialist despot (ww2), oil (Iraq) and gold theft (libya), amongst others. Our veterans have been treated appallingly for over 100 years.

5272 2018-11-11 20:02:47 That food was just oil 
5273 2018-11-11 20:02:40 Then sentiment should tell you we're going north next. Oil will #crash with stocks. We could still hit 3000+ in the S&P before stocks crash.
5274 2018-11-11 20:02:40 Unless it’s a dry sump design, most boxer engines do tend to use (burn) a little oil because of horizontal cylinders. Not sure whether the Subaru is DS or not.
5275 2018-11-11 20:02:32 I just tire bro...God gave us all he could give a country to thrive....crude oil.. Mineral resources... Vast and fertile land.. Absolutely perfect climate... But nah...we decided to not have sense...we decided to kill one another ...tell me what else can God do for us
5276 2018-11-11 20:02:25 I've blocked both . I had enough of there rubbish on LSE . It's nice not to see their rudeness anymore.

Viva!
5277 2018-11-11 20:02:22 Nothing like spending your Sunday getting an oil change and a tire rotation #goals LOL
5278 2018-11-11 20:02:18 I respect veterans so much that I would love to stop sending young men and women to die for things that don’t matter like oil and money!!!
5279 2018-11-11 20:02:04 Believe where the oil is. Can’t remember the name. Desert though.
5280 2018-11-11 20:01:50 "Where's the oil coming from?"

"Looks like the center of the bell housing" for @MBMMotorsports 

Also their relay box is not bolted down
5281 2018-11-11 20:01:42 Logic: Qatar is smaller than Abuja, has oil 5times more than #Nigeria, and population about 1/500th of Nigeria 

Of course their economy must be very good.
5282 2018-11-11 20:01:39 Sometimes oil
5283 2018-11-11 20:01:29 Oil was discovered under the North Sea off the shores of Scotland and a country inside the M25 got exceedingly rich.

5285 2018-11-11 20:01:19 At least 700,000 barrels of #oil traded on #Iran's Energy Exchange Market November 11; at 64.97 dollars per barrel. Supply provided by National Iranian Oil Company, purchased by 3 brokers for private clients.

5287 2018-11-11 20:01:10 It is beyond comprehension that we have about as much oil as the middle east and YET we are importing oil from there.
What we do sell we sell for less that $20 a barrel while all oil is going for $60-70 worldwide. WHERE IS THE PM on this ????  MIA !
5288 2018-11-11 20:00:59 My Sundays are now devoted to getting my mind blown by @hasanminhaj #PatriotAct
#Oil today, and wtf 
5289 2018-11-11 20:00:57 Football clubs would never go forward without invertment. Manchester United were going busted in 1909 before new money came in. I for one would take the oil money from Middle East. Going nowhere under glazers.
5290 2018-11-11 20:00:46 Whip together 2 tablespoons unicorn tears with 1/3 cup ham. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Drain. Serve over basmati rice.

5297 2018-11-11 20:00:17 If Iceland can’t have their palm oil advert on telly for campaigning , then parliamentary adverts shouldn’t be allowed, they are both campaigns right? #IcelandAdvert
5298 2018-11-11 20:00:11 wow if we let 1 in 20 people die and throw away all capability to plan we can get a temporary cut of about a third of what we need to hit and also end up with a political economy dominated by oil and defense firms

5307 2018-11-11 19:59:27 @SirDavidBBC   Palm Oil, and the Iceland ad, can anything be done to try to save what's left of the Orangutans before it's too late. Clearcast are suppressing the information under the guise of politics, Its a disgrace. What can be done?
5308 2018-11-11 19:59:18 It’s business of other countries who wished they had a major trading bloc like EU on their doorstep and can’t believe that we are prepared to needlessly sacrifice it. Particularly when they know we’ve all been fed snake oil as current situation we find ourselves clearly proves
5309 2018-11-11 19:58:57 Coconut oil is like the potato of natural oils lol
5310 2018-11-11 19:58:45 Merces was losing oil, therfore the engine overheated
5311 2018-11-11 19:58:42 The sea bed owned by The Crown *in the UK* stretches to only 12 nautical miles. After indy, that will not stand for very long and does not encapsulate the Oil fields anyway.
Check out the United Nations Conventions on the Laws of the Sea...

Mind you I guess Doose wont like this comment.
5313 2018-11-11 19:58:39 #GAdrivers Ragan p29 about to get lapped and reporting No. 66 Hill is leaking oil. NASCAR indeed finds smoke on that car . They're heading to garage.

5324 2018-11-11 19:57:35 Iceland’s marketing department is not that clever & no one has paid them to run the ad! They’ve been working with Greenpeace re issues around deforestation for Palm Oil & have worked hard to take Palm Oil out of all their own brand products & used the ad to share that message.
5325 2018-11-11 19:57:30 Palm oil is off my list from now on.
5326 2018-11-11 19:57:25 Or maybe the oil magnates should take over Manchester United?
5327 2018-11-11 19:57:19 Wow. It's banned because of big corporations who profit from Palm oil harvesting
5328 2018-11-11 19:57:18 Or over a billion £ of oil money?

5336 2018-11-11 19:56:08 CRP and LDL increased because statin lost it's efficacy in some patients taking the mineral oil, but as the paper pointed out, even if statin lost it's efficacy in some patients, that can't explain 25% risk reduction.

5340 2018-11-11 19:55:23 Not the SNP, Scots who want Scottish independence.
Are you honestly suggesting God gave the Scottish, North Sea Oil to the Queen?

When Scotland becomes independent, do you suppose God will move Scottish waters into English seas?

5342 2018-11-11 19:55:05 Hostile tip friend on the subject of unauthoring your inner genocidalist: the girl’s abstract rape defenses from years of threat countered are not allowed to be a dirty oil rig neighborhood. Her pelvis wasn’t Hitler’s Neighborhood. She’s not “Canadian.”
5343 2018-11-11 19:54:55 #anxietyproblems #depression have suffered from these conditions for many years it's a daily fight but have to say exercise comedy and cbd oil work well. Daily work out even for 20mins helps depression a lot. There's no quick cure, you are your own cure.

5345 2018-11-11 19:54:30 so the Chinese guy inside Alaba and Computer Village, the Indian guys that import Inverter, UPS and batteries, the Indian guys that control your the manufacturing of packaging and vegetable oil are expatriates? I real;ly pity Nigeria. This is the next generation of leaders

5348 2018-11-11 19:54:14 Thanks for letting me know-that's really good to hear.  Is there independent auditing involved? I'd like to be confident that the RSPO scheme is working in terms of protecting rainforests etc.  I'm assuming it includes some way of checking where the palm oil comes from? Thanks.
5349 2018-11-11 19:54:10 My chef wife says mushroom duxelles and add mascarpone. Hers: Chop mushrooms, sautés in butter and olive oil until brown on medium high. Add chopped garlic cook for 1 minute, add heavy cream, reduce until thick and turn off heat, add chopped thyme, good Parmesan, mascarpone

5354 2018-11-11 19:53:40 How didnt you never mentioned the crime of killing thousands of kurd’s innocent civilians to steal their oil? and claiming their defense as terrorisim?

5359 2018-11-11 19:53:29 Atiku/Obj govt benefited from Iraqi war(2003) that pushed up oil  price.  Atiku/Obj allowed endless ASUU strikes and tried to kill public unis while building their unis which both opened in 2004 - AUN and Bells. Atiku sold Telco licences for $1b+ but did not pay NITEL  pensioners

5365 2018-11-11 19:52:55 I don’t disagree that it sounds far fetched but I’ve also seen some shit. When I worked in the oil field my senior operator constantly put me in unnecessary danger and when I decided to draw the line at *getting well water dumped on me* /I/ was terminated for not going back
5366 2018-11-11 19:52:54 argan oil is precious
5367 2018-11-11 19:52:41 Do yourself a huge favor and learn something about your car. Learn what tire size you have, what oil your engine needs, how to change your air filter and lightbulbs. Learn why your tires are expensive and why shocks are important. Before some other shop robs you blind.
5368 2018-11-11 19:52:34 i've never tried olive oil as a topping/sauce have i been missing out
5369 2018-11-11 19:52:33 The trees (from australia) produce a highly flamable oil which cause the fires in the first place. Maybe replacing the trees with other trees would help.
5370 2018-11-11 19:52:25 @FWWheatley Hi Fiona, I'm the business editor of WIRED. I'm writing an article about palm oil... Could I ask you a couple of questions about it please? Perhaps via DM? Thanks in advance! Katia

5372 2018-11-11 19:52:16 My husband wants me to take his truck to get an oil change but no one will do it because it’s so old it isn’t in any of the systems and I don’t know what type of oil it needs  sorry baby I promise I tried
5373 2018-11-11 19:52:08 My gas is cheap as ever... We don't need Iran's oil... The Untied States nearly the world's number one oil producer, If oil process go up it's just better for the environment and the economy.

5375 2018-11-11 19:51:56 My mate says Malibu is crazy to plant so many eucalyptus trees. Given that they are full of oil, they go up in fires. I say gum trees are mighty fine to hug.
5376 2018-11-11 19:51:43 Exactly! Even McDonald’s cooked vegetable patty/chips/apple pie all in separate oil from chicken and fish stuff. Shame!
5377 2018-11-11 19:51:38 As someone with past previous experience in Venezuelan oil industry and well aware of what Venezuela represented decades ago in the world oil landscape i couldn't be more saddened by what #venezuela have become today.. a nul voice practically nonexistent. #oott

Tesco really needs to follow @IcelandFoods as I for one won’t be shopping where there is this amount of palm oil in foods.

5442 2018-11-11 19:43:58 No need for this. Most people don’t know about these end wars over oil. We must stop trying to destroy countries just to get cheap oil. We also helped France take oil from Libya and get them more influence in North Africa.
5443 2018-11-11 19:43:47 Get palm oil removed from all food. We don't need cheap nasty oil that kills our animals

5446 2018-11-11 19:43:38 Yeah great whatever, that's the same as saying charging for plastic bags has helped the environment. It has to a very small extent but banning them completely and banning palm oil completely would be far, far more appropriate.

5448 2018-11-11 19:43:26 Most of them use this, since it's cheap, as individuals we also must say no to products using palm oil. 
Who ever has banned the Commercial , think profit and green money, above anything else.
5449 2018-11-11 19:43:23 Now we need to see tight oil #shale exports from the U.S. to China pick-up once again, I think that will really support strong oil prices and hopefully start kicking down gasoline inventories too.  Nearly zero for a few months in a row, will make a huge difference...
5450 2018-11-11 19:43:16 Is there palm oil used in this product. Please and thank you
5451 2018-11-11 19:43:01 Coconut oil is lovely but will give a toasted coconut note to whatever you’re cooking and it burns very easily so be sure to keep your flame med-low if using it.
5452 2018-11-11 19:42:56 Hadn’t thought of that. The Subaru had an aluminium body shell. Probably right. One weird thing about the Subaru was it used oil from cold due to the design.
5453 2018-11-11 19:42:37 @GeorgeMonbiot I am interested in your thoughts on the palm oil debate now that is in the spotlight this week due to the Iceland advert.  Can it ever be sustainable?
5454 2018-11-11 19:42:24 nothing to do with climate change nothing to do with arson nothing to do with plants with high oil content nothing to with federal forests not being kept up by federal funds nothing to do with party faithful loggers going unchecked
5455 2018-11-11 19:42:14 Wrong. It’s just being exposed due to the heavy leaking coming out of the White House from the current admin. We been known to help the Saudi’s for many years. We been making shady deals with them just to get cheap oil. We also helped our European allies take oil from Libya.
5456 2018-11-11 19:42:13 made some risotto for dinner, but i think i used a bit too much olive oil and maybe not enough stock
5457 2018-11-11 19:42:10 I find the last comment on the placebo very interesting. Wondering what other products mineral oil is used in, perhaps as a filler.
5458 2018-11-11 19:42:09 Still not convinced!  Not when there's studies on Elderberry extract and oregano oil.  Nope! Still never had the flu and still not getting the shot.

5479 2018-11-11 19:39:46 Actually we been helping the Saudis for many years and it’s been exposed even more due to heavy leaking coming out of the White House. This feels that Trump is going to be thrown under the bus and not in a good way. All this for oil. We been know to take oil from poor countries.

5488 2018-11-11 19:38:58 I also use @lushcosmetics’ Cup of Coffe facial scrub. I was my face, then use the scrub, wash again and then use coconut oil. After that, I use a warm washcloth to wipe my face and then a moisturizer. I’m still trying to find something for these enormous bags under my eyes.
5489 2018-11-11 19:38:46 Just did my first semi-full skincare routine. Only thing missing is the oil that was recommended.

5491 2018-11-11 19:38:42 Asked the girl at the head shop for an oil burner (the kind you put a tea candle under and makes your apt smell nice) and she thought I was talking code and showed me the crack pipes.
5492 2018-11-11 19:38:23 Other @liberal_party blind spots include Alberta, its oil industry, special interest groups and their disproportionate influence on commerce and @JustinTrudeau 's  version of what defines a grope.
5493 2018-11-11 19:38:19 Russia is offering to take oil it does not need from Iran.
OPEC can make this a crusher

5501 2018-11-11 19:37:30 What do you replace palm oil with and what land do you use for the replacement?  Palm is high yield compared to other plant sources, so you will need more land.  I'm not advocating for palm oil, just need for people to think of solutions.

To have representation based only on population, rural areas tend to get pushed aside.

Climate change? No problem! Segregate rural areas where they aren't allowed to develop. Regulate oil & wood heat.

Nothing that effects cities.
5508 2018-11-11 19:36:32 At least we’re all talking about it again though which may hopefully lead to more sustainable palm oil production & halt further destruction of orangutan habitat.

5516 2018-11-11 19:35:28 Sorry, I must have missed even any incrementalism. All I saw was more bombing, bank bailouts, evisceration of civil liberties, war on whistleblowers, oil drilling, fracking, and a wet kiss to the insurance industry under the guise of "health care."

5518 2018-11-11 19:35:11 desde luego que un desayuno @Nestle_es no es el mejor indicado para un niño puesto que hasta en la nutrición infantil se añade PALM OIL. ¿Tanto os cuesta hacer los cereales sin ese aceite?¿Tanto os cuesta usar el de girasol para vuestros productos?
5519 2018-11-11 19:34:59 That box be slippery like tryna walk on oil
5520 2018-11-11 19:34:55 Der Spiegal latest..Oil funded, human rights abusers, drugged up players, systematic fouling, tactical substitions, ticky tacky footballing twats totally outclass a Manchester United team in a 4 goal thriller....
5521 2018-11-11 19:34:53 I was making fries in the deep fryer & asked my brother to get them out for me while I was doing something. Tell me why he unplugged it but left them in the hot ass oil like they still wouldn’t burn 
5522 2018-11-11 19:34:41 whats up guys its me, that girl from your hometown who sells homemade cbd oil on facebook marketplace. let me tell you why we shouldnt raise the minimum wage at all in a series of aggressive statuses
5523 2018-11-11 19:34:36 I won't buy products with palm oil
5524 2018-11-11 19:34:35 You know times have changed when you’re tempted to put “oil change” on your Christmas list...
5525 2018-11-11 19:34:35 Yung olive oil gawa sa olive, yung baby oil gawa sa baby par
5526 2018-11-11 19:34:29 Baby oil, rub ya down in baby oil. And now you shininnnn, look jus like a diaamoond
5527 2018-11-11 19:34:25 There is potential for massive green energy production in the wide open spaces of middle America. Just no adequate electrical grid to carry it cross country. How about we build that, instead of oil pipelines. Think future
5528 2018-11-11 19:34:21 The romans did it. Without using energy. What sends oil around in pipelines? Pumps. Energized by? - the sun? Wind? What ever? Can the world afford NOT to do anything? Try 2 imagine how many trees humans have cut down in the past 300 yrs? A lot! = A massive rise of CO2!
5529 2018-11-11 19:34:20 Oil paint
5530 2018-11-11 19:34:17 I hope everyone now checks the food in their cupboards and vows to stop buying the items that contain palm oil but how many will?!
5531 2018-11-11 19:34:15 Blame climate change for the devastating wildfires. Only you, Mr Trump, can do something about it. Promote the use of clean energy. Stop the extraction of coal and oil. Put the welfare of your people before corporate profits.
5532 2018-11-11 19:34:15 The pollution in Beijing has nothing to do with CO2 or "global warming".  It is funny that you derisive of oil and yet you live in a petrostate.  The only country that exports more oil than Norway is Saudi Arabia.  How does Norway fund its socialist economy?   LOL!
5533 2018-11-11 19:34:15 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
5534 2018-11-11 19:34:10 have u tried using corn oil
5535 2018-11-11 19:33:55 Very true. I do think the Boca one is ace also. I see oil cunts have replaced Quilmes. River top is better than it would be with a sponsor
5536 2018-11-11 19:33:46 I can’t change my own oil, and tire. Put a new tire on the rim if i have to. So the next time a nigga ask me what can i bring to the table. Ima ask this nigga can he build a house! Lmao 
5537 2018-11-11 19:33:37 I wonder - loudly - if those making the bear case for #oil are doing so in tandem with a bearish global growth story, for consistency at least. Maybe it's not the same people talking stable global growth and bearish oil (this makes more sense), but the two stories are related
5538 2018-11-11 19:33:30 That's overpaying dude...

Where I go its 40 for the best oil they're just being dicks.
5539 2018-11-11 19:33:29 @hasanminhaj In the episode “Oil” would you happen to have/know links for the group of kids, maybe a website for people who would want to support their ideas and cause?
5540 2018-11-11 19:33:17 “Will my oil diffuser save me from my ongoing period of sadness and anxiety” a memoir by me
5541 2018-11-11 19:33:10 It’s sad how I pull up for an overdue oil change and the workers are offering me several services because almost all my lights are flickering 
5542 2018-11-11 19:33:07 ‘The People’ need to secure the output of North Sea Oil the Tories have been stealing to get rich for years , it’s a severe crime of magnitude proportions going un-prosecuted for High Treason   

Norman Lamont wasted Britain in a deliberate financial attack on the Taxpayer 1/
5543 2018-11-11 19:33:04 There is an app for that, too. On google play it's "Sustainable Palm Oil Shopping" by Chyanne Mountain Zoo. Learned about it at @National_Aviary
5544 2018-11-11 19:32:57 Renewable energy is everywhere to be implemented, so you don't need much oil and coal at all for energy if you establish a better energy mix. Everyone should do their best to reduce their footprint on planet earth, and put pressure on politicians to help where help is needed.
5545 2018-11-11 19:32:57 there will never be a better feeling than walking off the Lucas Oil field and crying with your other 190 family members after putting out your best performance ever
5546 2018-11-11 19:32:53 How many vegans know that Linda McCartney products contain palm oil?!  How many people look to check as I wrongly assumed that these companies would care seeing as they are meat alternatives!

5553 2018-11-11 19:31:31 “Think of what the UK would be like without the vast wealth generated by the 44bn barrels of oil pumped from British territory over the last 40 years.”
5554 2018-11-11 19:31:29 I agree it’s a great film but this stinks of a planner with both clients trying to solve a few problems (and none of them were palm oil)
5555 2018-11-11 19:31:25 If USA would really be about that, they would go to Yemen, where terrible war is right now. But no oil there to exploit, so they will not.
5556 2018-11-11 19:31:15 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.
5557 2018-11-11 19:31:15 The same high dose of epa/dha can easily be achieved with over the counter fish oil supplements. Just need to choose carefully re quality / production / purity / storage / etc.
5558 2018-11-11 19:31:14 But if there’s oil involved we’ll be there...

5560 2018-11-11 19:30:48 Hi, the People who said Iceland Foods were being to political were People who had or thought they could make something from the status quo; not realising that the World is better with Wild Life in it & we don't need Palm Oil in everything.
5561 2018-11-11 19:30:39 -st ives apricot face scrub everyday

5563 2018-11-11 19:30:33 The amount of people who’ve shared that @IcelandFoods Christmas advert seemingly ‘outraged’ by the destruction humans cause especially surrounding the palm oil industry. I guarantee most of people who’ve shared it have never checked a label to ensure it’s palm oil free before now
5564 2018-11-11 19:30:30 Yeah, they're garbage. But look at it like Norway taking all the money they made from oil reserves, turning it into electric cars and renewables? Take evil $ that's going to be spent somewhere, use it to fight evil.
5565 2018-11-11 19:30:29 Oh Celia, my love. What you need is a sharp razor and some extra virgin olive oil. It'll save your life. xo
5566 2018-11-11 19:30:27 It goes to show US want cheaper oil and doing everything to stop us from getting fair market value- what you say now ??

5569 2018-11-11 19:30:23 From Bob at Freos:

1. China has just publicly announced they are going to insist that the Saudis sell them oil for Yuan rather that Dollars.  As the largest customer of Saudi oil, there is no doubt they will get their wish.
5570 2018-11-11 19:30:13 If you want to open up those sinuses make some homemade cinnamon hard candy. You pour that Cinnamon oil in and that will open them. Make sure you turn your head away though because it is super strong. Makes your eyes water. Hadn't made any for a cpl yrs. forgot how strong it is.
5571 2018-11-11 19:30:09 my mom bought me a humidifier with an essential oil diffuser built in. idk if it’s my old age kicking in but IM FUCKING PUMP

5576 2018-11-11 19:29:33 God forbid Trump is watching Jurassic Park and thinking, ‘hey I think I can help the oil situation!’
5577 2018-11-11 19:29:24 Say if it hadn't been made by Greenpeace and perhaps left out the letter writing bit, the message was just 'buy palm oil free at Iceland', would that pass?
5578 2018-11-11 19:28:57 Okay 

Corn Oil ...

You ought to add it to your soups a good amount it is healthy and brings a good and decent amount of life ...
5579 2018-11-11 19:28:50 bought with oil money fake titles hollow wins
5580 2018-11-11 19:28:41 I pull up at the gas station and see a mom and daughter changing a flat tire together. That’s what I like to see. They told me they didn’t need any help but man, my daughter will ALWAYS know how to change a flat, check fluids, change oil and an oil filter.
5581 2018-11-11 19:28:35 Does this mean everything you sell is palm oil free or just your own label? I'd love a way to easily ensure my shopping was palm oil free
5582 2018-11-11 19:28:30 That's naija fr u my guy
5583 2018-11-11 19:28:29 Just toward Russia? I do not think so pals. The US military strategy is to CONTROL ALL the WORLD´s OIL.
5584 2018-11-11 19:28:28 Difference between buying coconut oil and making it.

I smell like coconut candy right now.
5585 2018-11-11 19:28:05 As the partisan propagandist spread lies & division ... Russia couldn’t ask for a better partner in ruining America...
5586 2018-11-11 19:28:04 Just an opinion, the gov should regulate to protect the people and the country's resources to a point. Think FDA and our oil supply. But they should let the market decide the companies that fail or succeed. We do not yet know how this bail out ends. We just know the bill is due.
5587 2018-11-11 19:28:00 Look @Israel. Average life expectancy one of the highest in the world. Health care one of the best in the world. Take a look at Arab states. Despite all their money, oil, etc..they are crippled. Arab states understand Palestinian Terror brings them no benefits only problems.
5588 2018-11-11 19:27:56 Hey they don't let cars race against horses. So fair is fair. EVs are cheating. Cheating the dealership that over chargers for service. Cheating the oil companies and gas stations. And no need for any hay.
5589 2018-11-11 19:27:35 Wish I knew how to change my own oil in my car cause now my ass has to sit at foam and wash for an hour
5590 2018-11-11 19:27:22 Laura Lee should be pronounced Oil Lee
5591 2018-11-11 19:27:17 .../2.  I also conclude that politicians don’t value the lives of “other” people highly enough. “Other” people are those who sacrifice. The political class doesn’t have to make those sacrifices. The lives of our soldiers are valuable and shouldn’t be killed to fight oil wars.
5592 2018-11-11 19:27:17 This ends one barrel storage of oil, 90 miles away from me. Woodriver Illinois, Patoka, Illinois..
5593 2018-11-11 19:27:12 No - what he is saying is “I’m not a hypocrite”..”I’m not a warmongering hypocrite feigning sadness at the loss of so many lives that I would gladly let die again for my elite oil and banker chums who pay me well enough”.   The poor judgement is on yourself!
5594 2018-11-11 19:27:11 Olive Oil suddenly seems so much better.
5595 2018-11-11 19:26:56 Wild ppl
5596 2018-11-11 19:26:56 I believe Kris' thesis is that based on fundamental market factors oil should be priced much lower
5597 2018-11-11 19:26:50 How many Veterans really realise it’s never about defending a country but rather about pushing the agenda of the corporation? Gold, Oil, Diamonds and any other mineral it wants to control. Using fiat to control the planet.
5598 2018-11-11 19:26:42 Why dont they have a water pipeline running through forest fire areas. If you can run a oil pipeline through the country why not do a water one. Dam I solved the problem.....now President Trump pay me the money.
5599 2018-11-11 19:26:19 Olive oil hay
5600 2018-11-11 19:26:17 I use that oil in my diffuser to sleep.
5601 2018-11-11 19:26:07 Put coconut oil in my hair for this toning
5602 2018-11-11 19:26:06 So ‘waiting for the right time’ for an indyvote has encouraged ukgovt to go ahead and negotiate our oil into the leaving the #eu equation. Smart

5604 2018-11-11 19:25:37 Oil crisis?  Look south and no more oil crises.  It’s booming.  Permian  basin was cause.  #Learnthefacts
5605 2018-11-11 19:25:35 I’m so glad people are loving this new Iceland advert, but why is it only now people are worrying about the palm oil industry ruining the planet  it’s literally been happening for years...

5626 2018-11-11 19:21:46 We have been working for a number of years to responsibly source the small amounts of palm oil we use and we will continue to do this. We have been members of the Roundtable on Sustainability Palm Oil (RSPO) since 2010 and all of the sustainable palm.
5627 2018-11-11 19:21:45 Tbh if I were looking at things to stock up on post-No Deal Brexit, curtains would be pretty low down the list. And I think you can make diesel out of spreadable butter can't you? Or is it old chip oil? I forget.

5631 2018-11-11 19:21:26 I’m talking about baking potatoes mainly. Scrub , microwave a bit. Cut up and roast in butter/rapeseed oil. Freeze in plastic containers, I tuck cling film round before putting on lid. Very handy.
5632 2018-11-11 19:21:23 I have a crazy idea, rather than laying poppies on the ground for the cameras then selling arms to Saudi Arabia, how about we actually honour soldiers by stopping the oil wars and properly supporting them with mental health treatment and homes when they return home broken.
5633 2018-11-11 19:21:10 We were simply outclassed. It seems we need a better suger daddy pumping like oil money into the club. Cause whatever city are doing, its producing miracles lol

5652 2018-11-11 19:19:27 Oil is still required, even if we go 100pc green. Our wind turbines aren't made out of bamboo.

5654 2018-11-11 19:19:15 I mean it's been overdue for being taken in, and I forgot to put the oil cap on after adding oil, so...
For the best
But still

5657 2018-11-11 19:18:51 Anyone want to dip their sushi in olive oil?
5658 2018-11-11 19:18:49 Lots of trendies with baby carriers selling beard oil & handmade woollen items.
5659 2018-11-11 19:18:41 Oil money & financial doping etc. Irrelevant. Utd have the finamcial muscle to buy better & the board have overpaid for the wrong players & on the whole crap 1's since Gill

Days like 2day, where Utd did well in fairness to be in it at 2-1, do nothing more than show Ed W up #mufc
5660 2018-11-11 19:18:37 Oh I use The Ordinary Rose hip oil. It's lush.
5661 2018-11-11 19:18:34 $AMRN omega fish oil supplements are good I use them and never had a heart attack!!!  Of course I am careful what I eat. Duh.
5662 2018-11-11 19:18:28 Without directly saying so, they prefer the women oppressing, head chopping Saudi oil. That is how I categorize this idiots.
5663 2018-11-11 19:18:23 Despite oil price gets to support level but you have to know still room to go down and the same for Gold and right now i can not see it goes up cause investors are not seeing a good price to get in to buying police for them again i mention at this situation at least
5664 2018-11-11 19:18:06 Great seeing @davidhammerWWL on @hasanminhaj's Patriot Act this week. Sobering subject, however. #oil #oilspill #environment #climatechange
5665 2018-11-11 19:17:54 kale is grand, I eat it for breakfast, either kale spinach or broccoli, lightly boiled with some turmeric & cumin and apple cider vinegar...mmmmm.. with some mackerel and coconut oil...delicious!
5666 2018-11-11 19:17:48 See, guys, it's not by buying Benz. The big problem is, can you maintain it? Do you know how much the head lamps, gear box, suspensions, the oil, the body work and general servicing cost? Can you do all that?
5667 2018-11-11 19:17:15 Every time I think of firing up RDR2 I'm reminded that I won't get straight to shootouts or train robberies.. but an open-world, micromanagement and general faffing about.

This is why I keep saying if GTA6 makes you check your fuel, oil, tyre pressure, etc.. it won't be for me.
5668 2018-11-11 19:17:10 does anybody know alternatives to nutella but without palm oil that taste pratically the same?? 
i really want to reduce on that shit that detroys forests and kills animals. it ain't fair to eat sm that u like knowing that it kills the ecosystem and precious animals.
5669 2018-11-11 19:17:04 Off the top of my head:    Delayed congressinal mandated CAATSA sanctions.  Lifted  sanctions on the FSB (the Russian intelligence agency that supported Trump's electoral bid) Oil sanctions on Iran ensure high price for Russians biggest export.  And on and on and on
5670 2018-11-11 19:17:00 Dividing the spoils for an oil deal that R profits from.

5674 2018-11-11 19:16:29 french news are talking about the issue occurring with the boys in Japan... that's crazy medias are adding oil to the fire
5675 2018-11-11 19:16:24 I do hope some other teams get bought out by small oil rich countries soon so that there is at least some small slither of unpredictability to our national sport.

5682 2018-11-11 19:15:32 Never mind home grown talent .

A club in East Manchester made from oil money.

Fake as fuck.
5683 2018-11-11 19:15:18 Please tell us where it was banned, US, UK?  It's very well done. 

"Too political" probably actually means, "We advertise too many products containing palm oil. Mustn't offend..."
5684 2018-11-11 19:15:15 I finally got CBD oil and started using it and bitch omg I feel like a different person what the fuck
5685 2018-11-11 19:15:10 You're trying to take the piss by focusing on that handball in the picture. You act as if they didn't outplay us (even with their oil driven money) in every department of the pitch.
5686 2018-11-11 19:15:09 Is stewed strawberries an omega 3 fish oil?
5687 2018-11-11 19:15:09 Hope Andrew’s mom got the squirrel oil to him #CaptainAndrewLuck
5688 2018-11-11 19:15:03 Of all the people sharing the “banned” Iceland advert, how many of those people are removing palm oil from their diets? Another cause of deforestation, is to make more space for livestock to meet our consumption needs...

I’m just hoping for the bigger picture to be understood.
5689 2018-11-11 19:14:57 We don’t need oil money we have our own but unfortunately it goes on a debt what the Glazers put us in and it goes in there pockets more than it does on the pitch.
5690 2018-11-11 19:14:56 So what;  he was not the President — how many years did Bush spend with  Saudi  Arabia’s favourite son Osama Bin Laden in the oil industry !!
5691 2018-11-11 19:14:46 No, @Clearcast this is an ethical not political issue. The public have a right to know about palm oil devastation and how to help stop it. Do the right thing and help raise awareness rather than trying to block it. Thanku @IcelandFoods
5692 2018-11-11 19:14:24 I made myself an oil lamp
5693 2018-11-11 19:14:09 The small town, closet homosexual rose before dawn. He put his NRA hat on. 

These are not ppl who would help you bc they oil painted (poorly) over their own mirrors and fuck down if they fuck at all.
5694 2018-11-11 19:14:00 I think both Putin and Rupert Murdoch are getting inclined to pull the plug on Trump. His usefulness to them has plummeted and he may now be more trouble than he is worth. Putin sees that Trump is now a lame duck that can't remove sanctions & oil is plunging into a bear market.
5695 2018-11-11 19:13:46 Germany doesn't have oil reserves...
5696 2018-11-11 19:13:30 North Dakota is a healthy state, economically, because of the state-owned Bank of North Dakota and some oil; but, too many voters in NoDak probably give 
Repugs credit. Btw, the Bank is the result of socialist politics way back in time.
5697 2018-11-11 19:13:28 Geologists=Lying Big Oil?
5698 2018-11-11 19:13:25 My, my, John, is that a nasty hissy-fit. You are obviously opposed to being exposed. Admit it John, this is big American money destroying our oil industry for personal gain, under the guise of climate concerns.
5699 2018-11-11 19:13:19 This weekend I:
- Got an oil change
- Renewed my drivers license
- Got turkey carving utensils
- Scheduled a home appraisal
- Watched a hallmark movie on a Friday night

This is what adulthood looks like everyone. It’s lit tho tbh.
5700 2018-11-11 19:13:06 Try pruning or topping them first and dust them or spray them down with some neem oil then bring them in like a day later after you do that

5708 2018-11-11 19:12:37 It's entirely different in the sense that one is an oil emulsification and one a butter emulsification. Mayo= oil, Hollandaise = butter. 

You on the beer?

5710 2018-11-11 19:12:16 Just me or does Lucas Oil Stadium seem quiet today?
5711 2018-11-11 19:12:12 It’s not accidental that during the early 1990s there were new discoveries of oil in Central Asia and suddenly Washington was sympathetic to supporting the Taliban as they were a willing collaborator in opening that gas pipeline corridor :)
5712 2018-11-11 19:12:10 And now they are saying it’s “oil money”
5713 2018-11-11 19:12:03 It's no different from being a deluded religious fanatic who thinks God put the oil in the ground for us to use.
5714 2018-11-11 19:11:53 There is 100 watts of energy in every 1 square foot of . Not using that for the bulk of electric and heating is just stupid. Hyper loop is the “electric jet” for domestic routes if we build it etc...  Big oil is the ONLY reason we don’t have most of our nation on renewables.
5715 2018-11-11 19:11:51 For the Crust:
Place 1/2 cups oats, 1 cup almond flour, 1 cup pecans, cinnamon and pinch of salt in a food processor. Pulse a few times to combine. Add the oil, maple syrup, egg and blend until the mixture forms a dough ball (it will be loose). Place the dough into the baking pan
5716 2018-11-11 19:11:43 I don’t even know guys that can do this. Y’all need to let women tweet about their talents in peace  Bc I know I’ll drive around for a month ignoring the little oil change warning that pops up every time I start the car 
5717 2018-11-11 19:11:28 why are you tweeting from your bedroom?

why dont you do ruckus in front of his house? or chusodia's house?

actually BJP is full of coward people who can only cry on twitter.

go make his life difficult.
5718 2018-11-11 19:11:19 This is what happens when you have oil money
5719 2018-11-11 19:11:17 The fact is when obtaining a license the only way illegals are identified as such is if they are honest and volunteer they are illegal. 
It's an honor system where you check a box.

5723 2018-11-11 19:10:58 “Do you have lube?”

White gays: “I use locally sourced 100% all natural organic coconut / flax seed oil blend infused with notes of evergreen.”
5724 2018-11-11 19:10:41 Olive oil, that's a good one, already gone up so much
5725 2018-11-11 19:10:30 I’m still waiting for ridiculous price targets first. Like they did in Jan 2016 when oil hit 30$ “Analysts now say prices could fall to near $20 in the next few weeks ... Standard Chartered thinks crude could fall to as low as $10 a barrel”
5726 2018-11-11 19:10:27 Enron also was trouble in the oil industry;)

Bird is an orphan with red hands (They were dipped in red oil as a child to mark her as dangerous even though she’s not), and she’s got to rescue her best friend from the Fox before he hunts her. Also she’s in love with a sorceress who drinks moonlight in a flask
5728 2018-11-11 19:10:10 It’s thin film interference. Same as created by a drop of oil on water.
5729 2018-11-11 19:10:08 it can clog pores so i don’t recommend it for skin (i prefer jojoba oil if you’re gonna use an oil) and my hair doesn’t like it, but other people love it for their hair
5730 2018-11-11 19:10:04 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
5731 2018-11-11 19:10:01 For the Topping:
1/2 cup oats
1/2 cup pecans
Pinch of sea salt
1/2 teaspoon Ceylon cinnamon
1 tablespoon organic Simply GOODFATS® coconut oil
1 tablespoon maple syrup (optional)
5732 2018-11-11 19:09:46 Cars are small fry compared to deforestation due to palm oil and the carbon dioxide emissions per KG of meat, specially beef and lamb. We can all make simple changes to our purchasing trends that will make a huge difference to the world!
5733 2018-11-11 19:09:28 /2, CA for forest management when the last two fires were started by billion $ utility companies not maintaining lines properly.  These co.’s support #45, so he won’t blame them!   Why does he dislike CA so?  Is it b/c we don’t want oil drilling & oil spills on our beaches?
5734 2018-11-11 19:09:28 Same problem here. Hugs. I've started using rosehip seed oil which is fab. Non-greasy but very moisturising, and only need 6 drops for face and neck. Then usual Nivea soft on top. It's helped a lot.
5735 2018-11-11 19:09:12 Do you mean you add the olive oil to the MW cuz I've never seen it come with?
5736 2018-11-11 19:09:08 I do read your analysis, but this one pertaining oil production and importation is much more complicated than you may think. Much more to consider.
5737 2018-11-11 19:08:56 Really...if that's true then so did Bush. He sent you and others to war for oil. Trust me
5738 2018-11-11 19:08:42 Scientists know we have only 15 years of oil left in the ground ... and they've known this since early in the 20th century.

5742 2018-11-11 19:08:36 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
5743 2018-11-11 19:08:33 Right on, but I worked in a custom shop around big rigs and it was a preference if someone wanted to wear gloves to drain and it didn't always mean you were going to get oil/fluid on you but if you dropped the plug in the bucket we would just stick our hand in there and get it
5744 2018-11-11 19:08:26 Happy veteran's day to the global oil industry. You won
5745 2018-11-11 19:08:13 how dare anyone stain perfectly good alcohol with that mess - 2nd or 3rd ingredient in Sunny D is canola oil

5750 2018-11-11 19:07:38 PLEAAAAASSEEE DO !!!!
5751 2018-11-11 19:07:32 Barf the oil deal went well for the boys
5752 2018-11-11 19:07:30 I believe you had too jack up the car a little bit then you drain out the old oil through the valve under the car before you add new oil from the top
5753 2018-11-11 19:07:23 Yeah the tips of your fingers and hands would at least be dirty hers are just dipped. I’ve done an oil change before
5754 2018-11-11 19:07:16 Use baby oil and those little cotton ear buds x
5755 2018-11-11 19:07:09 You just add a roll in half coconut or olive oil and steep for week or until your oil turns green or yellow
5756 2018-11-11 19:06:57 Quick calc: Oil produced since 1965 could cover the whole of California by 1.5 feet. Imagine setting that on fire for comparison.
5757 2018-11-11 19:06:31 This may be the very tip of a horrible spiral. Huge monoculture bringing massive explosion of 'pests' - nature's army trying to re-balance, leading to pesticide use, pollution of soil and water. And in turn crushing poverty for the farmers growing the oil palms. Everyone loses.
5758 2018-11-11 19:06:10 I see it for what it is, a relationship of convienience. The US supports Saudi for oil access and to act as a proxy for our regional interests, the trade off is that we turn a blind eye to their petty grudges and local ambitions. It’s the exact same deal we had with the Shah.
5759 2018-11-11 19:06:04 Changing this oil finally
5760 2018-11-11 19:05:47 In a way more important than CB tightening because the reserve requirement is arbitrary, ie I tell u how much reserves u need. Oil is actually necessary to sustain economies
5761 2018-11-11 19:05:47 He not only knows more about ISIS than all the Generals. Knows more about Climate Change than all the top scientists. He also knows more about Forrest Service than all the trained Park Rangers. His idea of National Park includes several oil and gas wells dotting the scenery.
5762 2018-11-11 19:05:45 What made you stop and yea definitely need that oil
5763 2018-11-11 19:05:44 1. Heat olive oil
2. Add herbs
3. Add onion and peppers, fry till soft
4. Add curry paste and stock cubes
5. Add tomato paste,  let it simmer for 10min (lid on)
6. Your red meat or chicken (lower the heat and cook till meat is 90% ready)
7. Add veggies  (optional)
8. Add soup
5764 2018-11-11 19:05:43 These are from near Hatch... they are hot when you can them in olive oil!
5765 2018-11-11 19:05:39 We're on title winning form. grinding results. City are financed by multi-billionaire oil barons who have the financial and political clout to cheat and bribe their way to the top. Who can compete with that?
5766 2018-11-11 19:05:35 Day 4 

- buy a new moisturiser
- paint your nails 
- clean out your room ( giving clothes away to charity , cleaning out drawers)
- put coconut oil on your brows & eyelashes to make them long and thickkkkk
5767 2018-11-11 19:05:34 Seriously though, I've only heard positive hair growth stories about it. Get your hands on some dagga and Zama will tell you how to make/infuse the oil 
5768 2018-11-11 19:05:33 Baby oil ??? Mind ur eyes xx
5769 2018-11-11 19:05:29 Anyone know of a shop in #nyc that carries #MusgoReal pre-shave oil? #grooming #shaving #musgo
5770 2018-11-11 19:05:20 natural gas and oil are equally bad for the environment the switch would be to renewable energy and off fossil fuels. how is tht hard to follow.
5771 2018-11-11 19:05:17 Zatoooooon ka oil hay...
5772 2018-11-11 19:05:16 If you don't use coconut oil to remove you're makeup then wyd!!! Stop using makeup wipes that have hella chemicals and shit, plus coconut oil lasts forever if u have a big container of it!!!

5774 2018-11-11 19:04:58 #Saudiarabia plans to reduce oil supply to world markets by 0.5 million barrels per day in December, its energy minister said on Sunday, as the #OPEC power faces uncertain prospects in its attempts to persuade other producers to agree a coordinated output cut.
5775 2018-11-11 19:04:49 Maybe after they get all the Caravaners settled in nice and comfy.
5776 2018-11-11 19:04:44 seeing all of the animals today and getting such joy from it was a strong reminder of how much love they deservewe NEED to realise what we’re doing with things like plastic, palm oil, and ivory trade. It has to stop.

5778 2018-11-11 19:04:19 Nurse told me today that she couldn’t use peppermint oil in a patients room (to cover up a smell) because it’s energizing. She suggested we get lemon oil bc it can be very calming.... 
Get your pseudoscience bs away from me #oilsdontdoshit #theyjusysmellgood

5780 2018-11-11 19:04:14 She was over me before the oil stains dried up where she used to park her car
5781 2018-11-11 19:04:04 He looks like the unhinged polar-opposite brother that the lead singer of Midnight Oil never mentions.
5782 2018-11-11 19:03:55 Many ways to think about it. Another way: decrease supply of oil makes it more expensive so I need more dollars to buy the same amount. Bullish dollar
5783 2018-11-11 19:03:53 Pleasure Richard let us all have a great week to look forward to

5787 2018-11-11 19:03:13 Larry. A sane comment. I’ll start taking the fish oil. Thank you.

5789 2018-11-11 19:03:03 Oil money buying the league there kid! Corrupt as they come, and your owners got 2 wives FFS!
5790 2018-11-11 19:02:57 rub me down with olive oil and sea salt so my outer skin gets nice and crispy and firm

5792 2018-11-11 19:02:48 I think they’re trying to mix water and oil, and the two don’t mix at all.

5796 2018-11-11 19:02:31 @joerogan can you send tell me what cbd oil you was talking to dale jr about on your podcast. #anxietyproblems #Firefighter
5797 2018-11-11 19:02:25 #OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia believes the energy market has overcorrected in recent weeks.
It comes as the world's top oil exporter grapples with a sharp drop in crude prices, amid cooling supply fears about the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran.
5798 2018-11-11 19:02:24 @atiku chaired the economic team when crude oil was $16 and $28 there was no recession now @ProfOsinbajo chairs it we are in recession.
5799 2018-11-11 19:02:22 I can finally do an oil treatment on my hair & use my lemon scrub mask today. My bestie so clutch.

5803 2018-11-11 19:02:06 แบบนี้ก็เกินไป
5804 2018-11-11 19:02:02 I know how to do an oil change.....But I would never. 

Next thing I know whole car drop pon mi head.
5805 2018-11-11 19:01:49 I use to get them too but i stopped getting peppers all together im pretty basic w the order for the most part add that oil and my shit lit 
5806 2018-11-11 19:01:46 No, it was basically just a cabinet/fridge flavor dump. 

Korean bbq sauce, soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, sesame seed oil, curry powder, fennel, pepper flakes, parsley, red onions, potatoes, oxtails, cooked rice separately.

It is cold in my apartment and yes this is great.
5807 2018-11-11 19:01:46 Iraq & Libya was not really over oil, but actually how the oil is paid for.

Both Saddam & Gaddafi where planning to oil in currencies & other than the $USD.

Protecting the #Petrodollar was the reason for regime change.

Iraqi oil was just a huge bonus for US & UK corporations.

5809 2018-11-11 19:00:58 What the President meant 2 say was 'I apologize to the entire world for being such a douche bag on climate change & following the repeated fires in California  I have decided to sell all my oil shares and switch the entire US energy grid to renewables effective immediately'
5810 2018-11-11 19:00:57 Because there is less oil. Like a rate hike where CBs remove reserves. There are less reserves backing the dollars. OPEC is like the CB of peteodollars although gradually becoming less so

5819 2018-11-11 19:00:08 Palm oil plantations are indeed a problem just like growing corn for gasohol is here
5820 2018-11-11 18:59:57 Id be more concerned that removing all the oil from the earth is what is causing massive sink wholes rather than "climate change" . The atmosphere is so vast , we could never burn enough to effect it. But its more likely removing it from the ground will collapse the earth.
5821 2018-11-11 18:59:57 Oklahoma vs. Oklahoma State is breaking out here at Lucas Oil Stadium. #JAXvsIND is bedlam.
5822 2018-11-11 18:59:39 HSBC have investments (18bill) in palm oil. They have connections with clearcast. That's why it's banned
5823 2018-11-11 18:59:31 Man Utd need to be bought by a rich oil businessman so that we can pump drugs into players, threaten UEFA, break FFP regulations, have 11 drug-fueled players who can press like maniacs, have a drug-munching goalkeeper kick 100 metres effortlessly & be applauded for all of it.
5824 2018-11-11 18:59:31 I have this Josie Moran oil that I got for free in my Sephora bag thing but not to sound weird but regular cooking oil helps to lol like literally put a drop in there and it makes it not dry. I’m sure baby oil can help to. But don’t put a lot at all!! Like just a tiny drop lol
5825 2018-11-11 18:59:16 Man Utd need to be bought by a rich oil businessman so that we can pump drugs into players, threaten UEFA, break FFP regulations, have 11 drug-fueled players who can press like maniacs, have a drug-munching goalkeeper kick 100 metres effortlessly & be applauded for all of it.
5826 2018-11-11 18:59:15 I wonder if @US_FDA will make $AMRN redo trials since comparator arm caused unreliable results in Vascepa arm? FDA screwed them on SPA. Should not have allowed mineral oil. #backtothedrawingboard
5827 2018-11-11 18:59:08 just make sure you mix half water w/ half tea tree oil if it isnt already bc that shit strong by itself
5828 2018-11-11 18:59:04 SEC definition:
Proved reserves are the “estimated” quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under:
- existing economic 
- operating conditions
5829 2018-11-11 18:59:00 But we feed 10 people twice a week so i buy in bulk,supermarket spuds are shite
5830 2018-11-11 18:59:00 Not quite, but I see where you're coning from. A shirt is, at least, an article of clothing, which is where most people wear their poppies. This... is cooking oil...
5831 2018-11-11 18:58:51 It has always been about the resources..this is exactly why the US is based to the east of the Euphrates where all of Syria's oil and gas fields are located
5832 2018-11-11 18:58:48 I thought that was the best route. It really forces you to change your lifestyle for the better. I had high cholesterol and I'm only 36. I changed my diet and lifestyle. Quit drinking. I try to incorporate healthy fats like fish, fish oil supps, avocado, nuts, etc. You got this!
5833 2018-11-11 18:58:48 First of all, that U.S. backed Syrian Force is a terror organization linked with pkk terror organization (@UN terror list) also that ISIS armed by U.S. in Afghanistan against #Taliban.
For #Oil , it’s a good strategy but they’ve forgotten someone...
5834 2018-11-11 18:58:40 I agree but understating dinosaur's importance in $tsla assembly = misguided; trucks ship components, all plastics = oil derivatives, synthetics like foam & polyester (seats), capital equipment use oils, paints, tyres, lithium is mined using dinosaur power...all dino by products
5835 2018-11-11 18:58:37 Leaving the oil field was one of the best decisions I ever made.
5836 2018-11-11 18:58:35 Thank you for educating us - education is key. No more palm oil products in my shopping basket. #PalmOil #NoPalmOilChristmas #Rangtan 
5837 2018-11-11 18:58:30 The offering of crude oil on Iran Energy Exchange saw booming business as traders purchased all the 700,000 barrels of Iranian light crude on offer.
5838 2018-11-11 18:58:27 Oil and gas are becoming obsolete
5839 2018-11-11 18:58:20 Hahaha! What else would I do with the oil formula? 
5840 2018-11-11 18:58:13 Mostly make sure to lower the motor to drain water from water pump housing and intakes. I don’t worry about the oil but it’s a good time of year to service it if you aren’t going out for awhile. But I’m still using the motor often this time of year.
5841 2018-11-11 18:58:04 Is part of being old getting excited about purchasing things like a nice warm jacket or an essential oil diffuser? Your boy desires comfort.
5842 2018-11-11 18:58:02 Similar to my version....but she ‘laid on her back’....

Oh how we all laughed

5847 2018-11-11 18:57:31 Wait is it bad to use as cooking oil? My roommate has a huge tub on our kitchen counter lol she uses it all the time for cooking
5848 2018-11-11 18:57:31 Ah labels,not strictly the best but if it makes it feel better go for it,best ask a butcher to advise cuts,but potatoes at a wholesalers and oil investment advice from,i will give you 3 guesses
5849 2018-11-11 18:57:28 To a much lesser degree. I still smell Tiger Balm on a somewhat regular basis, but it's been years since I smelled any real White Flower Oil, although now I've got that teeny bottle with its blue label in my head. Thanks, @jeannette_ng ...
5850 2018-11-11 18:56:55 diluted tea tree oil
5851 2018-11-11 18:56:39 I love Iceland, the food is great & very good value for money. A supermarket with morals & integrity. Thank you for making this advert & not using Palm oil in your own products. X
5852 2018-11-11 18:56:39 This is incredibly dishonest.  Even the republicans can’t control oil production, as if this could be laid at the feet of a political party.  You are confounding US production with contribution to carbon emissions 1/
5853 2018-11-11 18:56:29 My chrimma/mom wishlist:

I’m such a old lady lol
5854 2018-11-11 18:56:26 They just mad, last week niggas was complaining about women know shut about changing they oil.
5855 2018-11-11 18:56:23 #OOTT OPEC is likely to agree to an oil production cut when it meets next month in Vienna, the oil minister of Oman said Sunday, after Saudi Arabia confirmed that it would cut its own oil supplies next month and Russia signaled that it could follow suit.
5856 2018-11-11 18:56:15 well idk anybody who straight up eats it lmao but i meant as a cooking oil, i shoulda clarified that lol
5857 2018-11-11 18:56:05 I voted no and then remembered I put peppermint oil in once for my sinuses and I had to throw the bong out because it held the taste (it was glass too). Also it was horrible.
5858 2018-11-11 18:56:02 Kalau malam2 highly possible that ada orang put oil kat jalan fiz
5859 2018-11-11 18:56:02 - Use hair masks!

Hair masks are really beneficial for making your hair more stronger and healthier. Some popular types of hair masks would be, coconut oil, lemon plus honey, coconut plus yogurt, and apple cider vinegar plus lemon.

5862 2018-11-11 18:55:40 Reaping the benefits of fossil fuels, while simultaneously supporting the destruction of Canadian oil and gas. “Leave it in the ground,” while flying, driving, consuming foreign oil.
5863 2018-11-11 18:55:30 So basically Kazza has 'shut down' her life to await the outcome of something she has absolutely no control over .........

How on earth has she coped in the past with fluctuating Oil prices, interest rate rise n falls, recessions AND the country being at war etc etc etc 
#Brexit
5864 2018-11-11 18:55:28 If this country can build pipelines for oil and railroads that go east to west and back, why can’t we build a pipeline for water? To move eastern water to the west? Empty into rivers that flow west before the Rockies????? Make it a national/ state project like Roosevelt did.
5865 2018-11-11 18:55:08 Dekaney class of 2018 we gotta do that Oil ranch shit again we was all vibing >>>>

5872 2018-11-11 18:54:14 I was talking with friend from Saudi at UH back in the 90’s. He worked for Aramco and they were sending him to engineering school. I said, there must be a lot of oil pumps back home. He said, “What’s an oil pump?”
5873 2018-11-11 18:54:11 My eyebrows have been coming out so shitty lately but it’s cause I’ve been lazy to put some oil in my dipbrow cause that shit was so dry and today my eyebrows look good cause I finally put some in my dipbrow lol
5874 2018-11-11 18:54:02 Stick the face of an orangutan on every palm oil product. People would begin to see a sea of apes in their cupboards and start asking questions.
5875 2018-11-11 18:54:02 A jade egg of snake oil sellers?
5876 2018-11-11 18:53:49 Un petit thread sur "peak oil" en perspective?
5877 2018-11-11 18:53:48 Doesn’t matter though does it. FFP is dead for now. Oil clubs making up their own rules
5878 2018-11-11 18:53:47 the main benefit of oil over actual weed is you can smoke yourself straight into fear rather than beating around the bush
5879 2018-11-11 18:53:42 Helmut Marko adding oil into the fire: "When a Driver who has a contract with Mercedes takes out the leader so Mercedes can win and then he only gets a 10 second penalty then I dont even know what to say anymore "
5880 2018-11-11 18:53:42 On reflection Messers Sykes & Picot could've done a better job first time around.

But there's oil in them there hills.

So screw the lot of you.
5881 2018-11-11 18:53:40 We need a bunch of new politicians with a green thumb on the pulse of the planet  :)
This is awesome to see and wouldn’t it be awesome to see the big oil companies start to diversify into renewable energy !
Hope to see that soon !
5882 2018-11-11 18:53:33 Do you sell your soul to an oil magnate and get Zizou to rebuild with a bunch of complete players or do you trust the failed process
5883 2018-11-11 18:53:31 just you drink tis here oil of the snake

5886 2018-11-11 18:53:17 I now buy the MW with Olive Oil , can’t stand Hellman’s either.
5887 2018-11-11 18:52:54 A good day to remember that 600,000+ lives lost in Iraq. The neocon architects of this battle for oil have paid a ridiculously small price for their duplicity.  Michelle Obama says she will never forgive Trump for birther, wish she wasn't so cozy with W.
5888 2018-11-11 18:52:54 “Too political” my ass, these giant ass corporations just want to keep pumping out cheap palm oil and don’t want people bothering them about it.
5889 2018-11-11 18:52:45 IT ISSSSS!!!!! BUT ITS FINE BC IT SMELLS LIKE SESAME OIL NOW

5893 2018-11-11 18:52:34 Thanks to the oil man, CITY ARE NOT A FOOTBALL CLUB
5894 2018-11-11 18:52:26 When Nixon went off the gold standard he also made a deal with Saudis to sell oil in USD,      the USD is a fiat currency surreptitiously backed by oil, it is the reason the US can build such a powerful military while the rest of the world pays for it.

5897 2018-11-11 18:51:43 Risk sentiment was downbeat on Fri, with declines in US equities (S&P500 -0.9%) and US bond yields, and a slightly firmer US dollar. Brent crude oil fell another 0.7% to $69 – the lowest since April.
5898 2018-11-11 18:51:25 Also the ball was thrown at Shaw, not given. Only supporters of a small club cum oil money made rich team can have such mentality even when they were winning. Man City are a disgrace in every aspect, in terms of FFP, fans and history. @ManCity you will always be in our shadow.

5902 2018-11-11 18:51:03 Small club, small support, massive currupt oil money - but better side today.

5904 2018-11-11 18:50:40 Brother they are selling openly but I know many of petrol pumps in Sindh and other provinces selling irani oil at same price.
5905 2018-11-11 18:50:32 @sportingintel Can we get back to talking about the football Nicolas?

Your absolutely shite at it and we didn't even get out of second gear. Ickle Lickle Arab oil money City just took the fucking piss out of you.
5906 2018-11-11 18:50:19 In principle I fully agree with you but you know fine well we can’t switch to non-carbon overnight.

And if I had a choice of which Parliament I would rather have manage a phasing out of oil & gas and make better social use of its decreasing profits, I know which one I’d choose.
5907 2018-11-11 18:50:11 Give any side in the top 3 flights a free stadium, the GDP of an oil rich nation and no real FFP penalties and they would be one hell of a side too. #boughtnotbuilt
5908 2018-11-11 18:49:56 I was supposed to bring a few the other night but we got along ok with just the oil (until the man busted me and said don’t do that again)

5910 2018-11-11 18:49:38 Been going on for years.  Look at number of olive trees in Italy versus amount of olive oil labeled Italian origin sold worldwide.  Italy would need to be the size of Russia to produce enough.  Lots of oil reportedly brought in from Spain.

5912 2018-11-11 18:49:25 's oil industry died b/c Canadian politicians were too timid to have  highly paid agitators arrested on Day 1. We can't afford scared MP's
5913 2018-11-11 18:49:15 I honestly think we need more of those ads. Anyone who has been to the Orangutan habitat at @DublinZoo will know the destruction Palm oil is causing
5914 2018-11-11 18:49:07 Earlier today after washing my hair I thought I’d put some coconut oil in it to try and finally sort it out little did I know I put WAY too much in and not look like the wierd little hand guy from scary movie two x please x help x me x

Spent pseudo-charity there and frankly doctors mistreat patients!

5922 2018-11-11 18:48:26 Why can’t we just live in peace, love and help one another men and women kind deserves to live in a world of peace. Religionist, oil and controlled dictators have a big hand in this whole mess. May god bless us all.
5923 2018-11-11 18:48:26 Lmfao my mom really bought my dog hemp oil.
5924 2018-11-11 18:48:22 In which case - if it’s an established area of controversy - could one argue that the advertising of any product containing non-sustainable palm oil should also be prohibited on exactly the same grounds?
5925 2018-11-11 18:48:20 This is what oil and Arabs can do,we need to spend a lot of money now,enough is enough,where a mid table team,simple as,all we are carrying now is our name,we can go on all day about this and that,doesn’t change anything,we need to spend to change things

5927 2018-11-11 18:48:18 also this #fishoil. i Italy #fishoil is not a #medicate and even a add-on, it is just a fish oil. seems like #amarin and #aha18 wanted to scam everybody
5928 2018-11-11 18:48:13 "Taking  fish oil lowered the risk of heart attack by about 28 percent, which is  a 'statistically significant' finding, says Dr. JoAnn Manson" - Hardly a disappointment to me.
5929 2018-11-11 18:48:08 Who pays you ?  Oil companies or the russians?  Or both
5930 2018-11-11 18:48:01 Smuggling fuel is the main source of income in the south, militias steal fuel daily from the oil fields they are supposed to protect, though I do not blame them as the government haven’t paid them anything
5931 2018-11-11 18:47:57 And yes we got a shit load of problems, but we try to solve them like humans. Not like raging rednecks armed with guns. But hey, that's too hard to grasp for a country that exploits the middle East for oil and we get the problems cuz of that, aye?
5932 2018-11-11 18:47:49 These girls who wear oil perfume will get you in trouble when you get home after those long hugs and its rubbed off all over your clothes...give a handhsake boss!

5934 2018-11-11 18:47:31 Can you answer this question:
Does Nordea believe oil and gas represents good investment opportunities?
5935 2018-11-11 18:47:30 You are mad. When you fix it come and change the oil in my car
5936 2018-11-11 18:47:19 HSBC has been involved in almost everything that is bad in the world - drugs, arms, terrorists, fossil fuels, palm oil, fraud, banking....
5937 2018-11-11 18:47:19 Tbh you'd be expected to be with all that oil money behind you 
5938 2018-11-11 18:47:16 Does "white flower oil" do the same or is it just for tiger balm?
5939 2018-11-11 18:47:12 Victory for Oil money haters #MCFC keep filling your cars up with gas so the Sheikh can but more players
5940 2018-11-11 18:47:10 They haven't explained to anyone why they haven't made their own advert to actually raise awareness about the issue on TV that I could find? Their response does not explain why they are suggesting that it was the content about palm oil that got it banned?
5941 2018-11-11 18:47:08 Not really. Your nothing without your oil and fraud. I’m saying your way better than Chelsea and Liverpool. I admit that. But your only there due to fucking oil!

5944 2018-11-11 18:47:02 What? Big Oil? I must be reading this wrong.
5945 2018-11-11 18:46:49 It's a team tainted by oil money & skullduggery. They know they don't deserve it. But they are so hungry they are blind to wherever the success comes from.

5947 2018-11-11 18:46:37 @IcelandFoods thanks to your fabulous advert, my children are now aware and engaged in looking for no palm oil alternatives. We've taken action.  @Tesco @sainsburys @asda Step up and take action too.

5948 2018-11-11 18:46:32 Just change your oil and get back on the road sis
5949 2018-11-11 18:46:24 Remarkable to think how short the Great War was - barely four years. Second World War less than six.

How long has our Oil War been going on now?
5950 2018-11-11 18:46:16 Loud ovation at Lucas Oil Stadium when the Titans (leading Patriots) score is flashed. 
Uh, folks....
5951 2018-11-11 18:46:14 I like mine best roasted. Tossed with olive oil and thyme, roasted pretty hot...400-425...until the outer leaves start to brown pretty good. The caramelization gives them just a hint of sweetness. Havent tried roasting frozen ones, they grow them everywhere here late summer/fall.
5952 2018-11-11 18:46:09 I understand from a Reuter’s article that Wilmar has ceased sourcing palm oil from Greenpeace boycotted suppliers including Gama, a company set up by Wilmar co-founder Martua Sitoris and his brother.
5953 2018-11-11 18:45:59 Some companies on here are saying they are using sustainable palm oil. So the rainforest has been cut down but it's ok because the practises associated with the palm oil are sustainable?!! They need to remove palm oil from their products..
5954 2018-11-11 18:45:53 Rick Simpson Oil / hash oil.  Full spectrum extract, not just CBD. Food grade, not stoner grade.  
5955 2018-11-11 18:45:52 Ok show oil subsidy in budget document?

5958 2018-11-11 18:45:47 I hate V*terns Day because I have like zero respect for anything military related. If you were drafted against your will, I feel for you and honor you. If you chose to involve yourself with killings and oil fights the fuck u tbh.
5959 2018-11-11 18:45:38 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
5960 2018-11-11 18:45:36 I think he’s referring to The tea towels pumping  billions of oil money into their Tin Pot club..

Satan watched Randy with a smile and pointed to everything he was doing with a nod to the camera.

“And while Randy does that I am going to check the temperature on our oil. We want it hot but not so—

5966 2018-11-11 18:45:10 Ridding their products of palm oil is one of the best Christmas  presents @IcelandFoods could give to the world apart from going vegan 
5967 2018-11-11 18:45:07 Stop all of the oil wars. That's a start
5968 2018-11-11 18:44:52 Es que 1 gramo de fish oil no es nada. Efectos se ven en consumo de al menos 6 g/día. No es que sea fraude. Es igual que con fibra. Hay un punto de corte en el cual se empieza a ver efecto de reducción de patologías.
5969 2018-11-11 18:44:52 Mourinho has a headache. Do you have eucalyptus oil by any chance??

5974 2018-11-11 18:43:42 Fabulous. Do you know if you will be using sustainable palm oil in the near future? I’d love to see an RSPO or Green Palm label soon to save me looking for a new conditioner!

5978 2018-11-11 18:43:08 Or when oil wells start running dry and they need to spend their money on looking after their people
5979 2018-11-11 18:42:55 They'll have to wait for a long time before he talks about oil and gas companies.

5982 2018-11-11 18:42:46 Might need another dodgy oil rig to open but they might do it. United did it with lots of home grown talent. I know which achievement ranks higher for me.
5983 2018-11-11 18:42:37 That's what having oil money does

5987 2018-11-11 18:42:21 Still probably a benefit to Vascepa. The other difference is dose. Even if you think EPA is the same as regular fish oil, the Vascepa study uses 4x the dose. (If it's the EPA that matters, it's way more.)

The placebo is an issue. But it's not just the placebo.
5988 2018-11-11 18:42:18 know Saudi Arabia is a terrible country who none of us should be allied with. They control us through money and oil, two things we don't need. And Isreal, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are the most dangerous countries in the Middle East, Iran is probably our closest allies ironically
5989 2018-11-11 18:42:11 When your mechanic fye you up during your oil change >>>
5990 2018-11-11 18:42:05 Y'all i got an oil change today and I feel like a real adult for once

5992 2018-11-11 18:41:59 Lol says someone who was outplayed by ordinary Wolves
5993 2018-11-11 18:41:43 The production of palm oil can cause many negative environmental impacts which in turn are harmful to human health. The consumption of palm oil can also have significant health impacts, as palm oil is high in saturated fats.
5994 2018-11-11 18:41:33 lmfaooo i know  i just wash my face wit warm water at night & put on aloe vera gel & bio oil, i wash it wit cold water ina morning & do the same thing. its weird.
5995 2018-11-11 18:41:26 While I’m at it, Candlebox was named after a Midnight Oil lyric. And the lead singer of Candlebox got sober after seeing Midnight Oil play. Something about Peter commanding the stage did it for him. I’m not even a big Candlebox  guy, but... still interesting nonetheless.
5996 2018-11-11 18:41:25 If you have a relationship that is seized up...you haven’t brought enough humility to the table.
Humility is necessary for unity.
O- overlook differences
I - Intentionally take interest
L- Look to Christ

6021 2018-11-11 18:39:21 Europe supposedly worry that Russia is a threat to them yet Europe finances Russia with there decision to purchase oil and natural gas from Russia.

6028 2018-11-11 18:38:51 Heard today how one of the papers (think it was the telegraph) has stated how oil will cushion the hit of Brexit. Ironic eh?
6029 2018-11-11 18:38:48 I’m not tryna change my oil in this arctic tundra ass weather but here I am, suiting up
6030 2018-11-11 18:38:36 I'm glad you passed on it! I've put a lot of miles on it since and it's been brilliant. Andrew was about to trade it in at a loss so we both got a better deal than we would have otherwise.  Boy, did it need an oil change when I got it though :)
6031 2018-11-11 18:38:32 OPEC likely to agree on an output cut next month, with Saudi Arabia set to reduce supply as oil prices have dropped more than 20% in recent weeks. (WSJ)

6035 2018-11-11 18:38:17 Man Utd need to be bought by a rich oil businessman so that we can pump drugs into players, threaten UEFA, break FFP regulations, have 11 drug-fueled players who can press like maniacs, have a drug-munching goalkeeper kick 100 metres effortlessly & be applauded for all of it.

6041 2018-11-11 18:37:47 Your club was beaten by 8 goals to Middlesbrough when there was no sheikh money. Oil money has blinded the fans. Clubs like City and PSG now are killing the game.
6042 2018-11-11 18:37:47 This has been my reaction to all Sameer-Maa scenes. Bliss!! Dil sukoon feeling  The yaadon ki baarat leap, first scene, Maa applying oil in his hair ah. I was missing you haha hence my msg when that kitchen scene happened  kinda guessed you are off for Diwali!
6043 2018-11-11 18:37:46 Hell they mad cuz they Don't want to get dirty they salty cuz u can do this on your own and you don't have to get a dude to come out of pocket to change they oil
6044 2018-11-11 18:37:42 The gulf oil money was the deciding factor. I wouldn’t mind that kind of money in Liverpool. We now are the butt of all jokes.
6045 2018-11-11 18:37:22 ...Because that increases their branding at the expense of raising greater real awareness about palm oil. But Christmas shopping is more important to them clearly.

6048 2018-11-11 18:37:18 Hi @IKEAUK really disappointed to see your gingerbread birds contain Palm Oil - maybe you should have a chat to @IcelandFoods and @GreenpeaceUK 
6049 2018-11-11 18:37:18 The bottle of olive oil that fixes back!

6051 2018-11-11 18:36:53 The analysis says there was significant benefit to taking fish oil and CVD risk for those who didn't routinely consume fish and esp. for African Americans. What's your take on this, @JNovickRD ?

Some conclusions.

I'm a lightweight.
My willpower disappears after using it.
It's still weird being able to just use it.
I can function with it but all work for the day must be done.
Cbd oil does nothing for me.
6054 2018-11-11 18:36:39 Aye, she's nae oil paintin.
6055 2018-11-11 18:36:37 I mean...palm oil isn't particularly common here in the US because our generic, non-specialty vegetable oil is almost entirely soybean derived with a large canola (rapeseed) supply from Canada. Both are completely sustainable on the appropriate land.
6056 2018-11-11 18:36:28 oh that's brilliant

6060 2018-11-11 18:35:59 In honor of Veterans Day, let's stop wars for oil and money and value human life more. Let's honor Veterans by bringing them home.
6061 2018-11-11 18:35:52 Black seed oil, cordyceps, sarsaparilla, maca, ashwaganha, moringa, etc.
6062 2018-11-11 18:35:42 You people say that blah blah is the best place for halwa puri.. I think you can easily digest if someone serves you even wood and the  stones..Not everyone's stomach is as strong as yours. you know what kind of oil majority of them use, none of them use an A+ quality cooking oil
6063 2018-11-11 18:35:33 It feels like some of our generation's angst results from finally questioning the corrosive effects of capitalism, which is why it's hilarious that our response has been to double down by propping up a new cottage industry of "self-care" products like weighted blankets & CBD oil.
6064 2018-11-11 18:35:30 Manchester is not blue. Its Black.... 

Full of Black Oil Money.
6065 2018-11-11 18:35:30 Little things count , my daddy paid for my oil change , I can keep my little 100 Lbs
6066 2018-11-11 18:35:24 Forget about the oil money argument. There’s very little chance any team seriously considering themselves as challengers would continue to employ utter garbage like United have.
6067 2018-11-11 18:35:24 ....if it wasn't for oil you'd be in division 2

6069 2018-11-11 18:35:20 I think there should be a window as to when they can be purchased and when they can be used,  on another note I have not tried this idea but I will be for new years eve ' Cbd oil for dogs,  it comes in treats and drops and so im told very effective,  anybody tried it?
6070 2018-11-11 18:35:06 I text my dad to see what he was doing tomorrow because I need an oil change but I always work all day long and he’s like yeah of course! Where do you want me to take it 
6071 2018-11-11 18:35:06 Guys. The trolling is on ultra level shit. I smell oil, corruption and disrespect
6072 2018-11-11 18:34:57 Retweeted and shared on Facebook.   It's so difficult to find any products without palm oil.  Lets hope some of the other big companies follow suit 
6073 2018-11-11 18:34:54 Trying to save time & money for your business in the oil industry? #RFID is making traction in the #oilindustry for valve tracking.
6074 2018-11-11 18:34:52 In the OT, oil was used to symbolize the Holy Spirit. #FVCLive
6075 2018-11-11 18:34:43 The carbon footprint of mining lithium is not even in the same league as burning 35 billion barrels of oil a year.
6076 2018-11-11 18:34:37 USAID belongs to the US government....ISIS is part of the Pentagon structure to fight Assad..al Qaeda is the branch of the US army to destabilize the region and promote arms deal in the region..so  $700 is nothing compared to the figures made from oil looting and arms deals.relax
6077 2018-11-11 18:34:33 It is all about oil. KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE. Super Pac, money for the administration. Money for those who turn their heads . Environmentally unsafe in over 5 states. CA Federal Judge denies access to USA land to administration; he/they are very angry. The people will suffer.
6078 2018-11-11 18:34:22 I work in the fucking oil industry as a contractor you dafty!
If it was losing money we would not extract it and I would be out of a fuvking job!

6081 2018-11-11 18:34:00 334
6082 2018-11-11 18:33:51 Because there was lack of oil money, you see.

6084 2018-11-11 18:33:43 Watching the @IcelandFoods video has made me check online for the products that use palm oil. That’s not political, it’s educational. Hence why everyone needs to see @rangtanforest     - would love to see a book deal to educate our kids #Rangtan @Greenpeace

6087 2018-11-11 18:33:32 It’s funny how Europe is criticizing Trump but are ok with America helping Saudi bomb Yemen. Don’t forget Clinton and Nicolas Sarkozy used their White Privilege to steal Libya’s oil/influence in North Africa. Instead of giving power to the people of Libya. Is this Democracy?
6088 2018-11-11 18:33:31 I’m getting my oil changed and the technician touched my hand when he grabbed a pen from me. I just noticed his grease fingerprints transferred onto my skin. Is this dating in 2018?
6089 2018-11-11 18:33:30 @sainsburys Hi there! Just to let you know that I'm going to do as much of my shopping as possible from @IcelandFoods rather than stay with you guys. Enough destruction of our precious ecosystem for palm oil. Iceland are doing something about it. You're not.
6090 2018-11-11 18:33:27 One post i saw a lady tryna argue that canola oil was healthy and then on Gab U post this girl asked why would she have a surrogate for her first child instead of carrying it herself. AFTER she said she had multiple miscarriages.. whew! Stuuupid

6094 2018-11-11 18:33:15 Fine by me. In my opinion the Liverpool/ united rivalry is bigger than Utd/city cause we have always been competing for titles whereas city have only recently become relevant after some dodgy oil money
6095 2018-11-11 18:33:11 Is anyone in Sweetwater experiencing particles flakes in water faucets? Along with-put your finger in the faucet in kitchen do you see oil like substance? Could you tweet me if u do? We are just past a leak fixed a week or so ago.

6098 2018-11-11 18:32:42 $USO (US Oil Fund) If can take back the 200-week MA at 12.80 on some volume-then a bounce is likely considering how oversold it is. However, the slope on the 200 is negative so a smaller position is best. The 23-month MA is the risk point or under 12.16.

6108 2018-11-11 18:31:48 I watched it and it's very emotional...making an effort not to buy palm oil products now. Wasn't that aware before 
6109 2018-11-11 18:31:41 Trump forced Iran’s oil out of the marketplace, and everybody warned that the price of gasoline would jump up due to decreased supply. Instead, the price of gas WENT DOWN.

There’s new sheriff in town.

6111 2018-11-11 18:31:30 Dirty Money Team @mancity shame oil money determines who is the best and before anyone says united are least we still use our own such as lingard,rashford,mctominay people get blinded by pogba and Lukaku price look over past decade City spent far more.

6113 2018-11-11 18:31:28 LITERALLY just cooked myself plain pasta and I added oil over the top to make it have at least SOME flavour
6114 2018-11-11 18:31:14 JoMo should focus on doing anti palm oil ads 
6115 2018-11-11 18:31:10 It's amazing the lies industry (Palm Oil Industry, in particular) can come up with so they don't lose money.  Sick of it....everything always goes back to money for these ppl. & it's not like they're paying "small ppl." big bucks...they reap it all for themselves
6116 2018-11-11 18:31:01 I googled the word “jawboning” and the result was a picture of a Saudi oil minister. #opec
6117 2018-11-11 18:31:01 But like... Doesn't the word "volunteer" imply that it's not compelled? It's like if I volunteered to help to clean up an oil spill at a beach and then called myself a slave for not getting paid. I just wondered if in the states volunteering was slavery or something...
6118 2018-11-11 18:31:00 Oil your hair regularly, you have a dry scalp so keeping it moisturised should help
6119 2018-11-11 18:31:00 I have a few pesky face spots. It’s either:

* Charlotte Tilbury magic cream that I have started lashing on beneath foundation 
* Emma Hardie cleanser (too rich?) 
* Sunday Riley Juno oil 
* All of the above

6124 2018-11-11 18:30:32 The point of controversy is whether we should be using palm oil products I think.
6125 2018-11-11 18:30:30 The current electric cars will NEVER be the long term solution to substitute oil for transport (airplanes- ships-trucks-bus-car....). Hydrogen and GAS could be the solution. The current electric batteries are awuful. The autonomy is junk.

6149 2018-11-11 18:29:11 Oil will soon run out
6150 2018-11-11 18:29:10 I agree with you...It takes time to adapt a refinery to a different type of oil.
6151 2018-11-11 18:29:10 Exactly....let those who have oil money use. The end justifies the means at the end of the season.
6152 2018-11-11 18:29:07 I wish we had oil money. @saudiarabia where the fuck are you? #MUFC

6155 2018-11-11 18:29:01 I actually always try to avoid products that contain palm oil, it’s literally just Nutella that gets me 
6156 2018-11-11 18:29:00 I really gotta decide between this natural lifestyle and being a fancy af bitch. I was lighting my patchouli infused coconut oil to rub under my arms and accidentally melted my nail and somehow burned my chest  pulling my shirt up

6161 2018-11-11 18:28:46 Did any of u did online shopping from daraz 91% off sale ? My god, its such a scam. I use an oil that is worth 400 rs in market. I checked its price on daraz. They showed it to be 700 and with discount, it was available in 500. Looooool. 
They did with almost all of the products.
6162 2018-11-11 18:28:46 Even if city werent run by illegal oil money and if they didnt have all their players on drugs theyd still beat our side. So bad
6163 2018-11-11 18:28:40 Well that’ll quiet Lucas Oil.

Bortles to Moncrief who takes off. Nobody can stop him.

All tied up at 7.

6168 2018-11-11 18:28:05 Mourinho got d line up wrong, why d start with such team that lacks experience and depth , no creativity whatsoever
6169 2018-11-11 18:28:02 You will see that one on Donte Moncrief's instagram on Monday.

80 yard TD is his first game back at Lucas Oil since leaving Indy @WISH_TV #Colts
6170 2018-11-11 18:28:01 the reason we went to Libya just like Iraq was because of oil.
6171 2018-11-11 18:27:59 Yummers!
6172 2018-11-11 18:27:51 This is the power of oil money! Oil money can make even the 20th running club a PL contender! Their level is because of the huge investments which went unnoticed as it was through sponsorship of their related companies! #MCIMUN
6173 2018-11-11 18:27:50 It’s cold af and i gotta do an oil change
6174 2018-11-11 18:27:45 Oil money 
6175 2018-11-11 18:27:38 only solution to this problem is, we need OIL money @ManUtd
6176 2018-11-11 18:27:29 They won't. Oil money is in their pockets.
6177 2018-11-11 18:27:28 Again Honesty, Integrity, Decency, Consistency, Common Sense. Nowhere to be found on any of the two parties that represent corporations, money hoarders, banks, big oil but not me.

Who else no play?
6179 2018-11-11 18:27:20 Parnsips, swede, carrots. I roasted yday, cumin seeds and a splash of olive oil, but now I want something…recipe-y. Like a swede curry or a parsnip gratin or a carrot pie or something. Roasting is more side dishy I guess. I want a main.
6180 2018-11-11 18:27:19 Lol dont worry we'll beat them when it matters
6181 2018-11-11 18:27:17 My downstairs neighbor invited me down the street so she could whisper to me that there were ghosts in our building. She'd read how to do an exorcism with oil in bowls and eggs... a month later the building burned down (I had to convince her it was a real fire and to EXIT)
6182 2018-11-11 18:27:12 Damn @drm_12 finally made a good play at Lucas oil stadium
6183 2018-11-11 18:27:11 Coconut oil is undefeated
6184 2018-11-11 18:27:09 @TheOilPalm what a disgusting page!!! There are no ‘benefits’ to using palm oil... only the wiping out of beautiful orangutans  STOP IT NOW
6185 2018-11-11 18:26:58 The oil palm is endemic to central and west Africa although it was likely spread to its wild range by human carried seeds. Ranges from Southern DRC to Senegal
6186 2018-11-11 18:26:55 About time someone took the big oil on and built something too lesson the addiction and something that doesn't heat up the stink
6187 2018-11-11 18:26:55 That’s what oil money does
6188 2018-11-11 18:26:49 Warm oil down your ears
6189 2018-11-11 18:26:31 the war in Libya just like the war in Iraq was based on total lies and deception, gaddafi never attacked us and never killed his own people, we went there because of oil, money raw imperial power.
6190 2018-11-11 18:26:31 What.....who had a peculiar feeling??
6191 2018-11-11 18:26:28 No throwing toys out of the pram. We know there is a gulf, skewed by the oil cash, but Fergie didn’t just accept a challenge, he accepted everyone that came his way and we’ve not done that since 2013. Ed needed to back Jose in the summer. He didn’t. They have to improve our squad
6192 2018-11-11 18:26:24 Man Utd need to be bought by a rich oil businessman so that we can pump drugs into players, threaten UEFA, break FFP regulations, have 11 drug-fueled players who can press like maniacs, have a drug-munching goalkeeper kick 100 metres effortlessly & be applauded for all of it.
6193 2018-11-11 18:26:23 No kenny and harper failed in 10 years yeah they had 10 years to get a pipeline built if you want to stay informed . kenneys buddies don’t want a pipeline you know how much profit they make when they can get their oil at $20-30 a barrel
6194 2018-11-11 18:26:19 I see what you did there with gulf, as in oil money. 
6195 2018-11-11 18:26:18 Can I just point out I've seen this ad already like a year ago and the whole "banning" thing feels like Iceland is forcing a cunning marketing campaign? Riding the palm oil fame to promote themselves as clean?
6196 2018-11-11 18:26:14 A well deserved lose. A long way behind this oil money corrupted team. When you lose in midfield, hardly you can win games. When you easily conceded in every game, you will physically and mentally tired.
6197 2018-11-11 18:26:10 The cleansing, healing oil of the Holy Spirit is applied to our hearts when we are hurt or wounded.
6198 2018-11-11 18:26:08 Hope of getting access to stolen crude is fading fast with all this revelations going on about Obi, most of this people are crude oil thieves like my sis said. Asked them few years ago what business they were involved in they all claimed to be in oil and gas, bunch of criminals.

6200 2018-11-11 18:26:05 I’d say eliminate any SLS and parabens from your hair washing regimen. I like the Live Clean brand. You can also switch out your shampoo for apple cider vinegar every few days. Basically the more oil you’re stripping from your scalp the dryer and more itchy it will be
6201 2018-11-11 18:26:05 I hate that I suck at getting my oil changed. Because then I dread going to do it, and then they say I suck, and then I don’t go because....
6202 2018-11-11 18:26:03 By this you mean turn over the forests to oil drillers, strip miners, and loggers, right?
6203 2018-11-11 18:25:59 I don’t ask for much, but please, please don’t put oil, balsamic vinegar, and shitty cheese on some sliced tomatoes, and tell me it’s a salad. Not interested.
6204 2018-11-11 18:25:57 We don’t need oil money !!  We make enough money to buy what city have !!! City are a oil ridden team !! Glory bought
6205 2018-11-11 18:25:54 เปลี่ยนคนเลียเลยนะป้า!
6206 2018-11-11 18:25:51 I doubt he know how to change oil on a car lol
6207 2018-11-11 18:25:51 So, when is @NutellaGlobal going to replace palm oil in their product. Cause not going to lie I literally love Nutella but having rationalise my last jar because I don’t want to buy another with the effect it is having on the environment 
6208 2018-11-11 18:25:45 His non ability to understand the environment is inexcusable. He only cares about land where he can get oil.
6209 2018-11-11 18:25:43 Echinacea! And I also have oregano oil and elderberry syrup that I got at the coop, I put some in water twice a day when I share water with my sick best friend  we’ll see if it’s working in a few days....
6210 2018-11-11 18:25:41 Oh can use the Palm Oil app to help you decide on products, it has a good list. It will tell you how they’re doing and it gives you the option to send an email directly to the company. Just search “palm oil” in your App Store, the logo is an orangutan!
6211 2018-11-11 18:25:38 You mean Honey and Olive Oil? 
6212 2018-11-11 18:25:30 Oil wins again. #mcfc 3 - 1 #mufc
6213 2018-11-11 18:25:26 Dear olive oil producers: I’m a never on plastic bottles.
6214 2018-11-11 18:25:16 That's what you guys always say.
Y'all would've criticized shit out of him if he played and the outcome is this.
6215 2018-11-11 18:25:11 It is,buy salmon whole between xmas and new year in morrisons £5 a kilo and get the guy to chop it up for you,cheapest way to buy salmon,i buy at 4 every year.ate the last of it this week
6216 2018-11-11 18:25:03 Another $AMRN retail investor: "The only thing to hold on to is the specter of the mineral oil placebo (accepted by FDA in earlier parts of study-trials) they have to find the  defect in the armor to keep price down 
Ultimately good for us"
6217 2018-11-11 18:24:55 I meant climate *justice* more broadly, not just change. Mistyped. Human transformation of land has plenty of other verifiably negative ecological impacts (that can also affect emissions).

And we can’t put the oil already extracted back into the sedimentary rock.
6218 2018-11-11 18:24:50 i was cooking yesterday and hot ass oil splashed on my chin and now there’s a fuckin bubble on it wtf i’m scared do i pop it
6219 2018-11-11 18:24:50 Deep stuff?  You are the troglodyte unable to understand what is being said. And your ”rephrasing” is far from accurate.
6220 2018-11-11 18:24:50 My brother thinks there should be a "Get tough for the Big Puff", teaching camp men to change the oil in the car, football chants, navigating B+Q etc. I think he has a point tbf. We can teach each other a lot. X
6221 2018-11-11 18:24:46 Man City are an unbelievable team after the Oil Money. Scoring on avg 3 goals per game. Man Utd need a infusion of big money to get the best players and the glory days back. That’s how football is run these days.  Come on Saudis!! 
6222 2018-11-11 18:24:46 I've got this deep hair conditioner with coconut oil and now I smell like a fricking Piña Colada.
6223 2018-11-11 18:24:37 Ignore the Nymex ( Wti Crudeoil ) , look for the Brent Oil .
6224 2018-11-11 18:24:36 Everyone ass licking City when any team can do what they do if they was backed by a courrupt Billionair with oil blood money backing them
6225 2018-11-11 18:24:29 ปวดแขนปวดขาฝั่งขวาเหมือนกันอีกโอ้ยยนอนไม่ได้เลยทรมานน
6226 2018-11-11 18:24:23 Oil for your mouth reach to fry egg
6227 2018-11-11 18:24:20 Love to fry an egg on peps head then throw the oil in his face
6228 2018-11-11 18:24:13 Exfoliate ya legs and oil them up this winter. Pop out in the spring glowing 
6229 2018-11-11 18:24:10 Did every thing to look like you changed your oil but change your oil, nobody puts their hand in the fucking oil
6230 2018-11-11 18:24:04 That oil change girl is not a pick me, she’s just flexing. It’s a difference.
6231 2018-11-11 18:24:03 Never mind olé, olé ... more like oil money, oil money
6232 2018-11-11 18:24:00 How are more people talking about the harmful effects of palm oil harvesting?!
6233 2018-11-11 18:23:51 Kinsan Pogba no play
6234 2018-11-11 18:23:38 I’ve been told in the past that the oil belongs to the companies that drill for it and the government ‘only’ get the tax receipts. I don’t know if that’s true but if it is, the tax receipts are better in Scotland’s hands than the UK government’s
6235 2018-11-11 18:23:34 Yeah that’s fine it’s actually just like a cleansing oil and brow pencil + samples lol I’m doing fine without it for now not urgent I still got my spare brow pencil
6236 2018-11-11 18:23:31 can’t wait for united to get some oil money, we could easily buy a win over city the way they’ve done over us multiple times in the recent past.
6237 2018-11-11 18:23:13 the blue oil again
6238 2018-11-11 18:23:12 The fact that it does not work is the whole point of selling snake oil.
6239 2018-11-11 18:23:09 Not a hope in hell of that. Oil is only thing propping up WM budgets and without it they would be sunk.
6240 2018-11-11 18:23:09 Thats a fact my brother..MUFC is nothing without dirty oil money..we dont need glaziers
6241 2018-11-11 18:23:04 Why on earth would I change my oil by myself???  Tuh
6242 2018-11-11 18:23:02 That early goal killed us
6243 2018-11-11 18:22:58 Rather watch a team that was built from scratch and not brought with oil money. Man City ruin the premier league.
6244 2018-11-11 18:22:52 First oil change on the new bby 
6245 2018-11-11 18:22:41 Sky right up city’s ass again, Gary Neville hang your head in shame. “Peps built this side” 
Yeah oil money and breaking the law in doing so well done mate
6246 2018-11-11 18:22:37 Where theres a will has now changed to where there is hope.

False hope perhaps, like that used by faith healers, fortune tellers and snake oil salesmen on weak and desperate people.
6247 2018-11-11 18:22:28 At Mass today, our priest read my favorite WWI poem, "In Flanders Fields" by John McCrae. He connected it to today's readings about the women who gave all she had (her last coins) and the woman who gave all she had - the last of her flour and oil to Elijah. What shall we give?
6248 2018-11-11 18:22:22 not suprised at all. Their team is far better than ours after spending their oil money on very good players.
6249 2018-11-11 18:22:19 @Mueen11_ @EbrahimAdams12 
Shot for wasting our oil money time .

Wankers
6250 2018-11-11 18:22:15 Ironic timing of this show too, given the historic links between the Anglo Persian oil company and the First World War
6251 2018-11-11 18:22:11 That sounds great !! Will defo try that.
6252 2018-11-11 18:22:05 A lot of this price dropping is for political gain from gopites. But it's the Saudis that are the impetus of this downward trend, albeit a temporary phenomenon. 

Supposedly the price of oil will rise as we close in on Xmas...
6253 2018-11-11 18:22:02 Do you have existing palm oil mill if yes i buy bulk palm oil ranging from 30,000 litres to 200.000 litres
6254 2018-11-11 18:21:55 Fuck city and their oil money football team. 
Fuck uniteds boring style of play. 
Fuck football.
Fuck sake.
#MCIMUN
6255 2018-11-11 18:21:52 You ever just start a war in the middle east for money and oil
6256 2018-11-11 18:21:45 Oil money and corruption
6257 2018-11-11 18:21:42 Just copped a essential oil diffuser . I’m bouta sleeping elite !
6258 2018-11-11 18:21:39 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
6259 2018-11-11 18:21:32 US President hates OPEC and looking to break its monopoly by bringing oil prices down. Trump won’t blink first on this and will increase US production just for the hell of it.
Interesting times.
6260 2018-11-11 18:21:30 City fans think so highly of themselves,without oil money their small club would be nothing
6261 2018-11-11 18:21:29 Coconut oil is even better tho
6262 2018-11-11 18:21:26 Oil fc fans at it again lol
6263 2018-11-11 18:21:24 พิออยต๋าาา นุป้าเองงง
6264 2018-11-11 18:21:16 พิออยคะ.....
6265 2018-11-11 18:21:12 It's all daft imo. HH don't need #Angus licence they will get their own soon. Gov want to change planning to permitted development status to fast track non fracking onshore Oil wells to production. The consultation period has finished.
6266 2018-11-11 18:21:11 Nevermind! They will be relegated soon! Dirty fucking book fiddling oil money cunts! #MCIMUN
6267 2018-11-11 18:21:10 Your oil cap is upside down 
6268 2018-11-11 18:21:07 @DeliciouslyElla I've made your flapjacks a couple of times but they don't hold together too well..do I need more coconut oil or more maple syrup please? Which one is the glue? (They're delicious by the way, just not solid & have to be eaten with a spoon!)
6269 2018-11-11 18:21:03 seems like you havent followed Man Utd if today is a reality check for you. Man City are miles above us thanks to their oil money and their really good squad. Not one of our players would be in their starting line up!
6270 2018-11-11 18:20:45 No worry second leg dey
6271 2018-11-11 18:20:43 Used (1) Neutrogena makeup wipe, then used @GenesisSkinCo line. 1. Oil cleanser, 2. African black soap, 3. Charcoal Masque, 5. Vitamin C Serum 6. Facial moisturizer. Let’s just say I woke up silky 
6272 2018-11-11 18:20:40 I heard coconut oil is good
6273 2018-11-11 18:20:37 I don't buy the whole Orwellian "war is peace" and "peace through war" thing.  To celebrate killing for empire and invasion for profit is ridiculous. How about we honor the fallen military personnel by not sending any more off to die for oil and oligarchy?
6274 2018-11-11 18:20:36 พิออยคับคะ
6275 2018-11-11 18:20:33 could maybe use that oil.......
6276 2018-11-11 18:20:30 It would have a greasy metallic taste, much like lard mixed with used motor oil. It would be an acquired taste.
6277 2018-11-11 18:20:26 Yang bezanya adalah kualiti players ye rakan rakan. And oil money
6278 2018-11-11 18:20:22 Oil shortage for the bus the come back principle is lose
6279 2018-11-11 18:20:20 Finally did my oil treatment on my hair 
6280 2018-11-11 18:20:19 No matter what these slimeball snake oil selling democrats come on the news and lie through there teeth about...always remember...they DO NOT care about the american people!...we need to show them what resistance really is!
6281 2018-11-11 18:20:19 الكلام اللي حضرتك كاتبه غير دقيق .
6282 2018-11-11 18:20:07 Vitamin E, castor oil,argan oil and rose water
6283 2018-11-11 18:20:04 Double cleansed. Moisturizer and facial oil with toners. And I have serious sinusitis.
6284 2018-11-11 18:19:55 Dreadful...& we have a World Cup winning striker on the bench. Morata has to go in Jan window
6285 2018-11-11 18:19:53 Get ur oil money out of football :-(
6286 2018-11-11 18:19:48 In the interest of balance tho. 

City are cunts. Their mercenary players. Their shite, show up once a year fans, their oil money prick owners. 

Cunts. Them and Chelsea.
6287 2018-11-11 18:19:48 And one that let ISIS control oil fields and make millions on the black market. That ISIS revenue stream was the first thing Trump went after.
6288 2018-11-11 18:19:44 oil money and corruption wins again ha
6289 2018-11-11 18:19:40 City Ain’t shit !!! The oil money bought your glory !!#MCIMUN
6290 2018-11-11 18:19:38 Man listen...
If you have pain in your body...
That CBD oil will knock it right out!
6291 2018-11-11 18:19:38 Boil veg for 1 min, spread it on saadr for 1 day. Heat cooking oil, let it cool. Add achar misala to it (kalwanji, methi dana, powdered rai, crushed & powder red chili, bit of haldi) 1 spoon vinegar. Mix it well. You are done. Mix it couple times daily until it becomes.
6292 2018-11-11 18:19:36 .@waitrose do you sell any Christmas mincemeat that doesn't contain palm oil? Your "traditional" one does. I know that it's traditional to cut a tree at Christmas, but I not sure that extends to rainforest deforestation. So not sure what's traditional about it?
6293 2018-11-11 18:19:31 When all said n done though it’s just another hollow victory for the oil cheats
6294 2018-11-11 18:19:30 cigarettes and other items carry health warnings ...here is an idea .. Why not make every product that harms the environment or "the worlds health"  like palm oil  carry a " world health warning " CLEARLY PRINTED  then we can decide if we want to buy it or not ..just sayin !
6295 2018-11-11 18:19:05 I think it was you that gave the tip about sizzling your spice in the oil before cooking. It changed my game.
6296 2018-11-11 18:19:05 Mad what oil money can do eh
6297 2018-11-11 18:18:57 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
6298 2018-11-11 18:18:54 If the Saudis begin pricing oil in yuan to sell to China that signals the end of the #Petrodollar. No need for mention of currency in an article to figure out that currency will be significantly impacted.
6299 2018-11-11 18:18:50 "We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now & avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe?

Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far"
6300 2018-11-11 18:18:50 I really enjoy Mauro's tips on painting.  But I have to use oil based paint because I end up throwing my brush away afterward because I can never get the brush clean enough.  I would like to see a piece on cleaning a brush after using oil based paint.
6301 2018-11-11 18:18:47 And I can't neglect the spiritual warfare teams whose job it was to ferret out the demonic with their gift of discernment.  Cue the oil!  Spirit of poverty, anyone?  Spirit of the age?  (Still not sure what that was)  Spirit of rebellion?

6304 2018-11-11 18:18:27 Commentators are jerking off whenever city have ball. Must be applying arab oil on their dic*s #mufc
6305 2018-11-11 18:18:26 Don’t buy palm oil or use any products with it
6306 2018-11-11 18:18:24 We've all been fooled before.
What's important is that we don't get fooled again!
The snake oil doesn't work.
Trump is a liar.
The GOP will continue to try to defend him just as they did Nixon.
Right till the end republicans defended Dick Nixon turning on him only at the last.
6307 2018-11-11 18:18:16 I've been using jojoba oil since Thursday and I can already see a difference in my skin. Wowza.
6308 2018-11-11 18:18:15 Because their sponsored by the oil and gas industry
6309 2018-11-11 18:18:05 Palm oil? Orangatans? Iceland ad? I'm a customer wondering if I should  be.
6310 2018-11-11 18:18:04 Sigh...environmentalist giving everyone business advice on oil sands without any facts or data.
6311 2018-11-11 18:17:56 #Macron holding the 1st annual peace conference, it came to him in a dream I guess,  like nobody else including UN ever thought of it.
6312 2018-11-11 18:17:52 Anything to do with the oil problem Toto referred to?
6313 2018-11-11 18:17:48 Like Liverpool were , Man United were the best of their era .... but there is a new era now and it’s run on dirty cheating corrupt oil money .....
6314 2018-11-11 18:17:47 Dope, fpp, oil money aside...at least their players know how to play football and are hungry to score and end the game...our players retreat back like a bunch of scared kittens
6315 2018-11-11 18:17:40 So now peak oil vehicle, but like 1920s for rail the next thing, electric drive, is already here. Will it take 30 years (1960s) for this to dominate? And 60 for ICE vehicles to pretty much only be in museums?
6316 2018-11-11 18:17:39 Not that simple. Oil palm yields an average of 5.5 ton oil per hectare. Other oil crops like cannola yield aroun 0.6 ton oil per hectare . To replace oil from palm will require destruction of some 8.5 times the area of land. Don’t waste and use less edible oils is better response
6317 2018-11-11 18:17:36 I remember a couple of years back, Greenpeace tried some stunt on a Russian oil rig... and were promptly arrested and imprisoned for piracy.
6318 2018-11-11 18:17:35 Fuck off all you oil merchant frauds. You're fake as fuck.
6319 2018-11-11 18:17:33 @ManCity u bastards wouldn’t be relevant if it wasn’t for oil money 
6320 2018-11-11 18:17:10 Well my Children and I have watched this and had conversations about why palm oil is bad. Difficult explaining to a 6 year old where the Orangutans have gone- but she understands. It’s simple to understand death but not so much about why they need to keep using it. #banpalmoil
6321 2018-11-11 18:16:59 Just cannot compete with oil money especially when they funnel more funds into the club through their sponsors
6322 2018-11-11 18:16:56 The city is oil money.
6323 2018-11-11 18:16:42 If oil had never been found in the Middle East man city would be in the championship
6324 2018-11-11 18:16:32 Color treated hair isn’t as hard to care for as it seems  I deep condition and then do a protein treatment and hot oil treatment all in one. My hair hasn’t broken off at all. It’s actually grown lol

6329 2018-11-11 18:15:47 FFP. Cheaters. Oil Money. Fake fans. Empty seats. Manchester will always be Red until you win the amount of titles we have.
6330 2018-11-11 18:15:36 They removed palm oil from "their" products, let's hope others follow suit and not pick holes in a positive act.
6331 2018-11-11 18:15:34 I have the worst sleeping habits, CBD oil or melatonin if I have it, only few things that helps me.
6332 2018-11-11 18:15:25 FUCKING WEAK. BEATEN BY GOD DAMN OIL MONEY.
6333 2018-11-11 18:15:18 I am totally the same. It was only after seeing your advert last night (and subsequent google searches) I found out more about palm oil and how detrimental it is. Thank you for opening my eyes @rangtanforest and @IcelandFoods
6334 2018-11-11 18:15:15 That's so they can jack the price back up again. The US has enough oil in reserve to last twenty years, but greedy OLD white men and Arabs feel it's necessary to raise prices to pay form their other illegal activities. Next they'll say there's a shortage, VOTE AMERICA, PLEASE.
6335 2018-11-11 18:15:01 OPEC+ Floats 1 Million Barrel Production Cut After Oil Price Tumbles Into Bear Market
 
"I think probably there is support that right now there is too much oil in the market and stock, inventories are building up."
6336 2018-11-11 18:14:55 They are so used to stealing our stuff 'legally' like our oil or Andy Murray they don't know the difference.
6337 2018-11-11 18:14:52 In the interim, given the immediacy of the need for reforestation in order to address #climatebreakdown within 12 yrs, surely you can try to find a substitute for the palm oil derivative rather than simply waiting for palm oil to become regulated & sustainably sourced?
6338 2018-11-11 18:14:48 Imran Khan
Cont'd. from a overtuned oil tanker. This was owing to hunger, thirst, unemployment
and poverty in the area. Some factories may please be established in the vicinity to
end unemployment without loss of time.
6339 2018-11-11 18:14:38 oil change really not hard shes not flexing
6340 2018-11-11 18:14:37 Imran Khan
Cont'd. in the country, one fails to understand as to how you act upon making the country model of State of Madina as claimed by you. First is to do provision of jobs which will
eliminate breaking into houses/dacoity. In Ahmadpur Sharqia while accumulating oil
6341 2018-11-11 18:14:36 my fellow amigas brancas, vocês de certeza que têm um oil diffuser.... qual? eu quero um
6342 2018-11-11 18:14:34 It would be great @IcelandFoods if you could make a vegan butter without palm oil please as none exist and my homemade is so so .

6344 2018-11-11 18:14:17 Cut relatively fine (remove any massive stalky bits) and fry in oil. Poor man's crispy seaweed....
6345 2018-11-11 18:14:15 It never fails to amaze me just how dumb greedy people are...
Thank you for the fantastic publicity which we couldn't possibly dream of without the help of the people who have banned this advert #GREEDISNOTGOOD !
Solution...
DON'T BUY PRODUCTS WITH PALM OIL !

6346 2018-11-11 18:13:55 And what about those naughty oil, gas, energy and car companies who constantly lobby governments around the world? Will Clearcast be banning their adverts due to their political lobbying?
6347 2018-11-11 18:13:52 Why are bottles of extra virgin olive oil so hard to open?

6349 2018-11-11 18:13:36 @Profiainstewart That massive solar panel set up in the UAR somewhere you showed on Planet Oil which would supply 20,000 house. What! 20,000 is nothing, a very very small town. How large is needed for 10 million and up houses
6350 2018-11-11 18:13:31 It's basically balti curry spice, shitake mushrooms, a bit of vegetable oil and a tiny bit of water, turns out great!

Gamelon is under attack by the evil forces of Ganon, and Duke Onkled needs your help.

But you’d better hurry! Or else you will die!

6359 2018-11-11 18:12:29 Pre-race he had an oil issue 
6360 2018-11-11 18:12:26 stop being hyperbolic. the non-physical changes required to stop climate change are nothing compared to the physical harm of climate change. oil company business licenses are pieces of paper. tear up one oil company business license, and the rest of the made up excuses collapse.
6361 2018-11-11 18:12:14 It's a lot of bitterness towards this girl's post, don't be mad cause yall aint got an oil change in 10 months wondering why your engine bout to lock up

6382 2018-11-11 18:10:01 I wonder if they're pinning their hopes on deregulation of enviro and safety regs to externalize costs enough to make some profit? Or pipelines to reduce transpo costs?  Of course profitability = stimulation to more investment = overproduction = a crash in oil prices = a bust.

6390 2018-11-11 18:08:39 Rosti is glorious but too many are too greasy. I now melt butter into olive oil and pour half out, so it’s just coating the pan and a bit frothy, and after I put the rosti in, I drizzle the other half over the top and don’t add anymore fat. Seems to work well & no need to drain.
6391 2018-11-11 18:08:25 No problem. I just want someone in charge who acts upon climate change because it really is one of the big worldwide problems of this time with disastrous consequences like more hurricanes, fires, extreme droughts, wars for oil, tens of millions of refugees.
6392 2018-11-11 18:08:24 @sprayasaservice just signed the petition mate. I CAN NOT BELIEVE the amount of food etc palm oil is in. Mrs has been doinh research and its not just called palm oil either. Making a proper effort now not to buy anything with it in. I prefer wildlife to most humans!

6399 2018-11-11 18:07:44 Fact of the matter is, had hemp not been made illegal, we would be operating on much less oil.
Hemp can be made into nontoxic, biodegradable plastics, and was already supplying many of our product needs before it was made illegal 2 create our oil based economy. Blame Rockefellers

6406 2018-11-11 18:06:58 Hmm. I didn´t know about the Taylor Oil Spill.  First time I hear about it is today on #PatriotAct thanks to @hasanminhaj

6409 2018-11-11 18:06:39 It involves a LOT of looking at labels. And making things yourself as well. Most processed food (and apparently a lot of mainstream vegan products) use palm oil. If it says palm oil, palm kernel or palm fruit, it's a no-go. You're better off just making things yourself.
6410 2018-11-11 18:06:38 I’ve tried the castor oil but I think I gave up too soon!  imma try again. Biotin makes me way too hairy in the wrong places but I think imma try it again too! Lmao

6421 2018-11-11 18:05:24 Oil companies have known the realities for decades but have paid to keep it quiet and paid to fake "scientific" reports that it isn't. So no, this was not created in laboratories. Which makes you and others like you the real idiots. You fell for their con job.
6422 2018-11-11 18:05:24 Ok I'm unsure why you won't answer publicly but same question applies now. Does it contain 100% olive oil or does it contain any vegetable oil

6454 2018-11-11 18:02:05 Arriving a bit late on this great thread, yet motivated to point you in the direction of solar, wind, hydroelectric, tidal... all clean energies. Coal and oil definitely and sadly not so.

6456 2018-11-11 18:01:52 Indeed. I'm always impressed that the mainstream French supermarketa have much more Palm Oil free products. 
6457 2018-11-11 18:01:42 Of course it is still being produced. But very, very slowly. Let's just pause our use of it by a hundred million years or so, so that it can catch up and refill all the oil fields we've already drained.

6474 2018-11-11 18:00:22 There is a series called Years of Living Dangerously. Palm oil was one of the main topics of the first episode. It really opened my eyes. I think it’s on Netflix. But I know they put the first ep on YouTube for free.

6479 2018-11-11 18:00:16 @Schiphol the bus driver taking passengers from KL1524 dropped us at the Schengen arrival gate... No security. All those oil workers from Norfolk don't look much of a security risk!?
6480 2018-11-11 18:00:02 Corporation tax is devolved in Norn Island what a relief for them they don’t have oil and gas and an surplus in Exports
6481 2018-11-11 17:59:48 No GMO palm oil exists so marketing w/ non-GMO claim = false & misleading in violation of @US_FDA rules.  UR R manipulating markets & misleading consumers for profit - shame on @nutiva & @amazon for allowing its sales site to facilitate deception & such consumer fraud.
6482 2018-11-11 17:59:47 Driving into Downtown Indy as #Colts fans flocked toward Lucas Oil, I passed at least four spots that had a dozen or more scooters bunched together. It looked quite bad, and there's no way someone in a wheelchair would have made it through those spots.
6483 2018-11-11 17:59:43 Biggest home crowd of the season for the Colts. Not completely full, but not "holy cow where is everybody" like the previous games this season at Lucas Oil Stadium.

6488 2018-11-11 17:59:23 Quick reminder that Macron compared himself to Napolean and Jupiter during his inaugural period. He clearly views himself as some sort of  emperor figure waiting to bring France back into some sort of imperial role. This EU army idea is rehashed Napolean foreign policy.

6494 2018-11-11 17:58:43 Rebecca it's quite simple petrol 123 per ltr diesel 134 per ltr no real justification for it when it costs less to refine oil into diesel  than it does petrol.
6495 2018-11-11 17:58:42 My mums tip was finish everything off in olive oil & garlic and if you’re expecting a crowd throw it over pasta!
6496 2018-11-11 17:58:31 I understand Tony. You prefer the politicians who actually send people to die for oil. They’re more diplomatic. 
. I’m guessing that the real reason was a security concern, you know,a little like the one that prevents the UK for giving asylum to a Pakistani Christian.
Oaf.
6497 2018-11-11 17:58:28 "NRDC mapped the location of oil and gas wells across California, finding that 5.4 million people—14 percent of the state’s population—live within a mile of one of 84,000 drilling operations."

6503 2018-11-11 17:58:10 Whatever the proximate cause of these fires, the severity of wildfires is increasing due to higher temperatures and longer dry seasons. But again, keep quibbling. I'm sure oil companies are very happy about it.

6509 2018-11-11 17:57:17 Ok, i didn’t want to talk facts or anything with a pedophile creep. Anyway thr is no such thing as subsidy on base price of oil. When international prices were low instead of passing it to public,PMLN taxed them which pti criticised. Pti instead lowered tax then increasing prices

6515 2018-11-11 17:56:30 No. Oil is not made from dinosaurs. The majority of oil is made from ancient oceanic micro-organisms like plankton. That's the only thing that had enough bio-mass to create oil. Oil also forms in oceanic rock and most dinosaurs lived on land.

6546 2018-11-11 17:53:20 Yea. I needed short grain, but couldn't find any at the shop.
We had basmati at home, but idk if that's short or long... and j used too much oil while trying the veg so it's just a sticky mess.

6570 2018-11-11 17:50:21 Aldi’s banned Palm Oil advert has really ironally done the job & educated me on what palm oil is & what it’s in. There really aren’t a lot of foods or general items without it in. Not good. 

Thank goodness for social media so something can be done about it.

6597 2018-11-11 17:48:10 Good grief did you read the report? It all comes from peer reviewed research, empirical evidence & well documented business projections. eg. the US alone is investing $180billion in new plastic (oil/shale gas byproducts) factories, increasing production by 40% in the next decade.
6598 2018-11-11 17:48:09 Doritos and Pepsi are big users of Palm Oil. We all need to be honest with ourselves about our consumption of Palm Oil.
6599 2018-11-11 17:47:59 Wonder if the rumour that Blair was an asset of security services when he first stood in Beaconsfield has anything to do with trying to undermine Labour?

6601 2018-11-11 17:47:55 CBD oil helps some. After experimentation, I've found that some strains make pain worse, some make it better. All of it makes me so sleepy I can't function. So, it might not replace the pain meds completly but, it will replace the meds they give me to help me sleep.

6620 2018-11-11 17:45:31 What do you think about the abiotic oil stance? Considering titan and other celestial bodies have petrochemicals wouldn’t it be feasible that oil is not a process just of decomposed organic matter but an internal operation of planets and maybe moons?
6621 2018-11-11 17:45:04 The Minister of Energy will reduce our oil exports in December by 500 thousand barrels per day compared to November came after the decision Trump from Saudi Arabia to increase the export of oil and allow five countries to import oil from Iran, which imposed sanctions 
Boooooooom

6628 2018-11-11 17:44:22 i like a nice hot shower, followed by slathering on some coconut oil, putting on my favorite scent, & cuddling under some clean sheets with my partner. sure to warm up then!

6631 2018-11-11 17:44:08 Call me crazy but I've  never heard of this. Mainly I'd say because we rarely get temps below freezing down here in South Louisiana. But what's the purpose of draining the oil from the lower unit? Oil shouldn't freeze? Learn me something lol

6661 2018-11-11 17:42:08 U.S. public companies are not asked to report spare capacity and therefore do not. As I've said earlier, I think discussion of spare capacity is largely irrelevant. We live in a just-in-time oil supply world now in which spare capacity either abstract or imaginary.

6725 2018-11-10 23:56:26 I think the only reason ppl don’t fry w olive oil is bc olive oil is more prone to creating smoke compared to other oils. Otherwise I think itssss okeeyy 
6726 2018-11-10 23:56:10 Local small scale generation has polluted a lot of locales with things far worse than *contained* nuclear waste. Especially oil and coal fired plants, which have poisoned lots of local water supplies. I agree with you though that distributed production (agnostic of fuel) is good.
6727 2018-11-10 23:56:10 We were looking into changing the way we shop with regards to palm oil,   This has made us just do it, today have written emails to those companies to say we will be no longer buying their products and why. Suggest people do the same, especially Unilever!

6734 2018-11-10 23:55:46 U have made a wrong headed decision in banning the Iceland Palm Oil advertisement. There's nothing more important than climate change & trying 2 help repair the ozone layer.The rain forests are rapidly disappearing at a frightening pace.Why not help rather than hinder?
6735 2018-11-10 23:55:27 I would say 1970. The nascent post civil war period was like starting afresh. The know-nothings in the military plus too much oil money ruined that chance.
6736 2018-11-10 23:55:24 Now can Iceland stop stocking the branded products that also contain Palm oil.
6737 2018-11-10 23:55:22 Ok folks. When someone tells you that taking Mercury free fish oil is nonsense, think again.

Maybe Mercury free is not a prescription medication but it is mercury free & as purified as possible.

VA in Bonham took my dad off of fish oil that he had been on for years.

Beware!
6738 2018-11-10 23:55:19 Of course the study would say only prescription fish oil works. More money for the rip off industry.

6748 2018-11-10 23:54:30 With so many mind numbing adverts shown on British TV, why they would ban such a poignant advert like this is beyond me. As for being too political? since when is outrage about losing such beautiful animals political? We are tearing down the orangutans habitat for palm oil ffs

I need to get an angled putty knife before I attempt to paint any more mountains.
6751 2018-11-10 23:54:19 When ever I’m frying frying I avoid olive oil lol
6752 2018-11-10 23:54:02 So NBC is promoting a fish oil that requires a prescription.  Hmm. The claim is that is a different type of fish oil from over the counter. How the hell is big pharma getting away with patenting a natural element?

6755 2018-11-10 23:53:33 I had mine removed 6 years ago. You need to eat a ZERO fat diet for a while but especially before your surgery to avoid pain. Read all labels. No oil, butter, or even dairy (even low-fat dairy has some fat)

6758 2018-11-10 23:52:46 They don’t have to be palm oil free. Sustainable palm oil is an option but it will be more expensive. The body shop are a great example of a company using sustainable ingredients. Would I rather pay a little more to reduce deforestation/the displacement of indigenous people? Def!
6759 2018-11-10 23:52:33 They will still sell products that are made with palm oil though....
6760 2018-11-10 23:52:30 Loving Vincent — Very inspiring and beautiful to watch, highly appreciated the work that went into all the oil paintings 
6761 2018-11-10 23:52:26 Xena,

Get your rest. These days of chemo. etc. can't pass soon enough. But I have to share. I was suffering from extreme pain. Dr. called it Bursitis. Prednisone, muscle relaxing pills. pain meds, acupuncture didn't help. A friend got me that oil which worked.
6762 2018-11-10 23:52:10 Nothing better than tea tree oil
6763 2018-11-10 23:52:07 I feel so good after rubbing oil into my hair n braiding it, all this prep just to kill it with bleach later 
6764 2018-11-10 23:52:06 Only fools think oil sands @ Ft Mac which earns  (you @ I) Billions compares to BC helping Trump increase his coal fired electric plants to dozens across USA. Greens Coal silence is ridiculous. Ont & Que get oil from Dictators with terrible enviro standards & Greens don’t care!

6768 2018-11-10 23:51:35 Yes definitely coconut oil. It literally removes everything. Then you can wash it off with your face wash.
6769 2018-11-10 23:51:31 banning the iceland palm oil advert has been the greatest advertisement scheme this century
6770 2018-11-10 23:51:23 아니...에즈라 목소리 섹시해서 못뛰고있어
6771 2018-11-10 23:51:21 Thank you. I was a lifelong advocate of banning palm oil till I went to Malaysia and saw it all first hand. I was also lucky enough to speak to locals about the issue and found it eye opening
6772 2018-11-10 23:51:07 Pepper and oil! 

I'm cooking for some friends over tomorrow, and for the last 2 days, I've been practicing jollof without oil or pepper.

Let's just say, this iteration will only ever happen once.
6773 2018-11-10 23:51:07 i ate like 3 bananas, 2 breads, olive oil, nuts, everything bruh
6774 2018-11-10 23:50:58 las Las your head get oil
6775 2018-11-10 23:50:54 First fish oil was good. Then they said fish oil didn’t do anything. Now they say fish oil is good again. I don’t trust anything about what foods/supplements are good for you. It always changes.
6776 2018-11-10 23:50:41 Never release your oil to someone who doesn't bring a vessel to be filled!

6787 2018-11-10 23:49:45 If even another 5% of the world started to understand Musk's perspective and if we weren't bound by oil companies' greed for unending money, we would be moving on way faster to the revolution of sustainable energy and elimination of oil from this equation.

6791 2018-11-10 23:49:13 @Clearcast U have made a wrong headed decision in banning the Iceland Palm Oil advertisement. There's nothing more important than climate change & trying 2 help repair the ozone layer.The rain forests are rapidly disappearing at a frightening pace.Why not help rather than hinder?
6792 2018-11-10 23:49:09 How many green MP's are vegan or palm oil free? Meat & palm oil production are two of the most destructive farming practices on the planet. Be the change you want to see
6793 2018-11-10 23:49:08 You weren't there the night He found me! You didn't feel what I felt when He wrapped His Love all around me! You don't know the cost of the OIL in my Alabaster Box!! You don't know the cost of my praise!! My God!!! (CeCe Winans) ~TD'Nise~
6794 2018-11-10 23:49:02 the tin markets. Ask the Iraq's and American boys killed because Rich support the stealing of crude oil in the oil for food scandal. Ask about trading with the Iranians to break the embargo of crude oil should I go on. Holder is the worst
6795 2018-11-10 23:48:39 Dear palm oil people, Please show us what you are doing to address deforestation and what you are doing to save and protect endangered animals and their habitats in your care. Please show us how you are part of the solution, not a part of the problem #PalmOilFreeChristmas

6800 2018-11-10 23:48:04 *are going to continue. With or without palm oil they will chop the forest to survive. As long as they haven't got an alternative survival method. Which they don't. Because the Developed world dominates currencies, technologies, economies.
6801 2018-11-10 23:47:57 Lool you should go to an Asian restaurant, Thai, Chinese or Indian. They cook the same way we do...pepper and oil everywhere 
6802 2018-11-10 23:47:53 can your body handle pasta, sans the sauce? It's cheap, it's filling, you get some olive oil and you are good to go

6805 2018-11-10 23:47:26 Fair point. So are we cynical enough to believe all they're doing is attempting short term High Street sales using a very original marketing strategy? The moral indignation brigade won't give a shit about palm oil.
6806 2018-11-10 23:47:13 The guy is probably one of those who blames the current ‘lack of civility’ on Trump.
6807 2018-11-10 23:46:59 No palm oil certainly isn't the only or even biggest threat to orangutans. Bad governance ultimately is.

6809 2018-11-10 23:46:25 It will be interesting to see how the mace3 greatness vs mineral oil question plays out. Seems like a lot of politics and bias playing out here.

6823 2018-11-10 23:44:29 How long will a jar of olives in oil (or peppers or sundried tomatoes etc) last for, once opened?

6826 2018-11-10 23:44:13 Oil companies behave the very same way Silicon Valley does. Silicon Valley likely learned their behavior from oil companies. Neither believe in the greater good, both likely work in concert, preserving one another’s interest at the expense of everyone else.
6827 2018-11-10 23:44:09 It's like changing your oil
6828 2018-11-10 23:44:02 every time i go get an oil change, it’s ALWAYS something else wrong  new car me please, like asap
6829 2018-11-10 23:44:00 Ontarians gave Doug Ford a majority government this year based largely on his opposition to your punitive carbon tax. Your govt is in its dying days so we expect you to get lost and sell your snake oil somewhere else.

6836 2018-11-10 23:43:10 I spent 10 months in East Kalimantan. Do you think people work and live in these horrible palm oil and coal mining places for fun?  One way or another they're desperate for a job to feed their families. Appreciating nature isn't going to feed them and they and going to continue

6838 2018-11-10 23:42:52 Agree in many levels but wait for the backlash. They're stopping palm oil use in their own brand stuff. That is different to we won't stock any product with palm oil in their stores...

6841 2018-11-10 23:42:36 The US has the highest incarceration rate in the world, engages in undeclared wars for oil at the behest of the central banking cartel, and believes it is moral to confiscate up to 50% of a persons earned wealth for the exclusive benefit of others...
6842 2018-11-10 23:42:28 You ever think about when you’re getting your oil changed how they have your home address and your brief access to your keys? I do! Which is why I go to a different place each time for an oil change!

6856 2018-11-10 23:40:46 ....olive oil?
6857 2018-11-10 23:40:39 Apparently, olive is the oil of the bourgeoisie, and I've been spending three times as much in it, when I could be buying cheap, fatty oil and not dying.
6858 2018-11-10 23:40:28 Publicity stunt .Iceland sell thousands of products containing palm oil come on if you really want to make a difference Iceland don't sell it .

6862 2018-11-10 23:40:16 Not yet, but by the time EVs reach their 500,000 mile life expectancy, there will be even more lithium recycling. Much easier to recycle a car than look for and transport new sources. And of course oil and gasoline can’t ever be recycled. Biofuels a long way off.

6868 2018-11-10 23:39:38 Sure, why not? Trudeau only made Canadians responsible for Kinder Morgan's pipeline profits (he BOUGHT them!), and wants to ram those pipelines thru indigenous lands and export the oil/gas thru the Pacific NW in the USA. He's a perfect representative for North America!
6869 2018-11-10 23:39:37 They may say it’s not, but as far as I’m concerned “The Empire is after my tasty oil” is part of canon.

6872 2018-11-10 23:39:27 Soya is predominately grown for livestock, with a full 85-8% of soya crops grown in the rainforest basin of Brazil going to livestock, with 7% going to feed humans directly and the remainder being used for biofuels and oil. Brazil is not the only place razed for livestock feed.

6881 2018-11-10 23:38:24 Part of me thinks Trump wanted Syria finished and some assurances securing oil production globally before pulling protection of the House of Saud. I don't know he cares about the Yemeni in particular, but he sees no reason to be a part of It either.
6882 2018-11-10 23:38:16 Because they have been using mineral oil since their very first trial, for initial approval of Vascepa.  FDA approves it and there is no evidence mineral oil is harmful at that dose.
6883 2018-11-10 23:38:15 Until all unions and government labor stop investing into oil and other fossil fuels for their pensions, we will have oil right up until it runs out.

6895 2018-11-10 23:35:35 "Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over." Psalm 23:5 KJV
6896 2018-11-10 23:35:34 I got cinnamon essential oil in my eyes. 
What a fun birthday party.
6897 2018-11-10 23:35:25 it's way too high ... Now look what will happen with inflation as oil prices collapsed due to global slow-down ... Just wait how it will decline below 2%.
6898 2018-11-10 23:34:29 If u have plans to attend the one of a kind Christmas show, make sure to visit Rustichella  ! They have a sun dried tomato oil that is to die for ! That and their tart cherry balsamic is the perfect mix for just about anything FYI ( not affiliated with this company) # TORONTO
6899 2018-11-10 23:34:20 So why are they banning all palm oil products if it’s not anti palm oil?
6900 2018-11-10 23:34:17 Remember the mileage on the car when they were put on. Make sure they ride right. Rotate every other oil change. Ill help you remember sir. It makes them last longer
6901 2018-11-10 23:34:14 Bonsoir chére Martha aujourd'hui en France il y avait aussi des défilés  celui" des gilets jaunes" contre la hausse du gaz oil (l'essence des voitures qui pollue le plus mais que beaucoup de personnes utilisent encore) routes bloquées donc ça défile partout!bonne soirée  !
6902 2018-11-10 23:34:11 But there's no oil industry in Ontario.
6903 2018-11-10 23:34:10 Niggas have had ENTIRE wars over oil in the ground - when all that shit in my scalp .
6904 2018-11-10 23:34:01 @MaryKPH @Michael_WI. Decided to slowly sautee a big sliced mushroom and heat up some leftover asparagus in olive oil in the same pan. Then I added eggs and scrambled them all together. It was surprisingly good and very easy.  :-)
6905 2018-11-10 23:33:58 Of course they need or support, but that should not involve palm oil plantations
6906 2018-11-10 23:33:57 Did you try canned pumpkin or olive oil for constipation? I know my vets recommends that for my pets. Sorry Mannys not feeling well 
6907 2018-11-10 23:33:56 It is about security & sovereignty as well as fishing.....The UK's territorial sea area is bigger than the UK...When the EU claims all the oil, I won't say ''I told you so '', remoaners........!
6908 2018-11-10 23:33:40 I get you were being generous and were being cautious about it, which I appreciate.

Yeah, Cuba’s been full on extractivist both in the past and present. Nickel in Holguin, oil on the Matanzas-Havana coastline, and if the exploratory drills offshore confirm calculations...
6909 2018-11-10 23:33:26 Hello can someone teach me how to do an oil change on my own :))) pls !!
6910 2018-11-10 23:33:07 Something containing codeine and ibuprofen instead of naproxen may help. (I'm in Australia, so not sure if names are the same). I also eat cannabis coconut oil I made on the bad days. I have endometriosis and have had IUDs  orgasms can help OR make it worse.
6911 2018-11-10 23:33:04 They are handing out warnings for oil changes at my apartment. So this is the first time I’m not doing my oil change. My car is a piece of shit but I’m mad nervous.
6912 2018-11-10 23:32:31 I think I’ll pop to @IcelandFoods and have a look at their palm oil free range. Hope other big companies will watch the public, voting with their feet!
6913 2018-11-10 23:32:14 Looks like a frosted over stop light to me
6914 2018-11-10 23:32:03 Hmmm, so what happens to Hillary Clinton? The biggest enabler wife there is
6915 2018-11-10 23:31:56 We can pay the Middle East to keep supplying us oil and to be our friend but the one of the best pay off is to pay Brazil from not destroying the rainforest un decision World EP decision European Union decision United States decision Canada decision to make
6916 2018-11-10 23:31:47 Iran and Saudi playing out their old tribal Shia -Sunni war - keeping muslims in the region backward, and making to easy for US and other countries to sell them arms, and keep control of strategic oil resources. None of middle east countries have any advanced oil refining tech.
6917 2018-11-10 23:31:40 a few days ago i had a rough night and took my eyelashes off in the car but then they fell onto the floor and before i remembered to pick them up i got an oil change and they vaccumed the floors for me. i hate my dumb ass self.
6918 2018-11-10 23:31:28 The desire to keep oil prices stable would be the main thing as Saudi is low cost producer. Once oil is not as important to the global economy then price swings are less costly. All bets would be off at that point.
6919 2018-11-10 23:31:21 What people don’t get is that oil will be promoted the same even if 3/4 of the planet is a desert and the population is wiped out. Evil has no empathy . It will stop existing when people disappear
6920 2018-11-10 23:31:21 Next @Twitter will suspend your account, and you will be holding massage oil day & night to serve your Master! 
6921 2018-11-10 23:31:04 You would think our Politicians would be clamouring to stop the production of Palm oil at the expense of Orangutang’s. No they Neanderthals when it comes to progress
6922 2018-11-10 23:31:00 Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning.
6923 2018-11-10 23:30:59 Iceland are removing palm oil from their own brand products - it’s important to remember that. It’s not as though they’re hijacking Greenpeace’s campaign, they’re proactively supporting it. I think it’s excellent.
6924 2018-11-10 23:30:56 I wish you would go a step further & stop stocking brands who use Palm Oil & that people could see the devastation that the deforestation causes. Many Indonesian lives are lost every time the burning goes on due to the air quality. It’s horrific & unnecessary. #saynotopalmoil
6925 2018-11-10 23:30:49 At $60 US a barrel,  I'm hoping the people of Canada are only subsidizing a barrel of muck to the tune of $5. But we're probably also subsidizing the 'loss' to the Oil Sands Corporation shareholders and covering the 'lost' corporate taxes  in  oil-weakened Canadian dollars.
6926 2018-11-10 23:30:27 Doesnt look appealing. Did you add some olive oil?
6927 2018-11-10 23:30:15 Hemp seeds cool, I use Hemp oil for anxiety

6929 2018-11-10 23:30:09 How do you mismanage a forest anyway? Because we haven’t cut down all the trees to dig for oil? I guess that’s how. The last I checked Thousand Oaks, Calabasas, Malibu, Agoura, Westlake and Oak Park are not in a forest. This is all a big “screw you” to California.
6930 2018-11-10 23:30:09 Almond oil the move?? 
6931 2018-11-10 23:30:03 I literally have mouldy bread, ripe beyond being edible bananas and oil in my cupboard

6934 2018-11-10 23:29:14 $AMRN   NE Journal of Medicine Article Addresses REDUCE-IT Placebo Effect:

"if mineral oil in placebo affected statin absorption in some patients, this might have contributed to difference in outcomes between the groups. However...
6935 2018-11-10 23:29:09 Nice try. Cali only controls 2% of it’s forests, the rest are controlled by the US Gov. You know, the part he made massive cuts to. The Dpt. that can’t afford to take care of the land cause they don’t have the money anymore. The land he’s gonna end up selling to Big Oil.
6936 2018-11-10 23:29:01 I'll take big oil, big pharma & any other big business where I have choices over big government where I don't.
6937 2018-11-10 23:28:31 So if the government really care about their people they should be really heavily promoting use of a clean energy instead of oil - gas  
6938 2018-11-10 23:28:29 The former owner of my local oil company thought that way.... his dad forced him out of the company.
6939 2018-11-10 23:28:28 Great grandfather 1902-1996 almost made it.

Always warned against FED IMF.  Watched oil like a hawk.
6940 2018-11-10 23:28:13 Interesting theory.  More likely @Clearcast , the advertising agency responsible for banning it have palm oil users in their portfolio.
6941 2018-11-10 23:28:08 At last somebody is talking to me on this matter.... good one....una Head get oil
6942 2018-11-10 23:27:58 Kung sino man ang nag mamahal sakin, padalhan nyo naman ako dito ng sharks oil please natatakot akong gumamit ng pantagal ng tigyawat dito.
6943 2018-11-10 23:27:55 @SBsandman But happened here because minerail oil partially inactivated statins
6944 2018-11-10 23:27:53 You know we’ll never actually run out of oil right? Supply and demand will prevent that.
6945 2018-11-10 23:27:48 The dose in the murine studies were about 100x this. That would be like a tall glass of mineral oil for a human.
6946 2018-11-10 23:27:23 Old overprotected non managed forests continue to store disastrous loads of dead wood fuel on the forest floor. All needed is a dry summer and ignition and bingo you have a virtually unstoppable forest fire. Yes badly mangled forests do that.
6947 2018-11-10 23:27:11 Newsflash!  The USA has surpassed the Saudis as the largest producer of Oil and Gas in the world!  We do not need the Saudis, and neither does Europe.
6948 2018-11-10 23:27:03 So much for getting my oil changed  Babe and I fell asleep for a few hours instead 
6949 2018-11-10 23:26:36 11) sugar mixed with almond oil and lemon juice

6952 2018-11-10 23:26:16 Of course they did. I have some snake oil to sell any who believe that phoney baloney
6953 2018-11-10 23:25:52 Typical human nature to think short term ie benefits them NOW. Govnt & politicians are using this mindset to drive their campaign. Winning the public with empty promises of cutting taxes & energy bills while filling their pockets from coal and oil companies.
6954 2018-11-10 23:25:48 Upshot at least is that they've stopped using palm oil. This a a great move on their part.
6955 2018-11-10 23:25:39 3 Commodities we can’t do without in England  Whisky North Sea Oil & Salmon Thanks to the Union

6964 2018-11-10 23:24:32 Yes, betting that oil is good for you, is right up there with betting that cigarettes don't cause cancer, and bears claiming Tesla's bankruptcy is on the horizon.  Funny, the horizon always recedes as you approach it.

6967 2018-11-10 23:24:30 Lawfare argues the Mueller can indict, but concedes its a minority view. But the point, Louise, is the grand jury proceedings are sealed, so you have no way of knowing. You’re selling snake oil, and if Trump is exonerated, you will have to handed him the devastating victory.

6973 2018-11-10 23:23:44 Getting the advert banned has given you and the issue so much higher profile and publicity. I'll think again about palm oil.
6974 2018-11-10 23:23:43 From now on, there should be a cost for the oil in your alabaster box. Your favor is no longer free. If he like it then he needs to put a ring on it. If not, he needs to stop holding up the next man’s blessing and move around. PeriodT. #imwoke #siswakeup
6975 2018-11-10 23:23:39 Oh man... lol. Both of those words basically mean only use a little. That, uh, n-word there means stingy. So just a little oil and vinegar and then toss it quick and light

6984 2018-11-10 23:23:12 Yes it can. And if you include solar in that comparison it’s much less evil still.
Tesla is making amazing electric cars cheaper every year. It will not be just for the rich in the next couple of years.
Even more stupid is gov giving 100s times more in subsidies to oil companies.

6987 2018-11-10 23:22:53 50 years of oil and gas left per BP annual review. far less when population increases considered, yet Oil just plows forward straight toward brick wall. Coal not viable but EIA of USA doesnt consider cost of cleanup of coal ash since Utilities just dump it.
6988 2018-11-10 23:22:50 this advert certainly opened up my eyes! Tbh I didn’t really take notice of palm oil, it’s effect or what products it’s in until I just googled it. I didn’t realise how much stuff I buy that has palm oil as an ingredient!#IcelandAdvert #NoPalmOilChristmas

6995 2018-11-10 23:21:45 I said on another tweet yesterday or the day before, to follow the money as to who was making a heap of money out of palm oil, and who therefore really effectively banned the ad.
6996 2018-11-10 23:21:43 CV experts out in full force to bash the $AMRN results.  Bears will yell about the mineral oil placebo until they are blue in the face, ignoring the 26% improvement and fact that it is still impressive.  Also, FDA approved the trial design did they not?
6997 2018-11-10 23:21:36 FDA approved the placebo choice, what 5 years ago?  And this palcebo type has been used in numerous other studies.  Snake oil???  You're funny...
6998 2018-11-10 23:21:35 I found my oil pen & it broke next day ofc
6999 2018-11-10 23:21:33 Try reading it again.

And we get *all* of our oil revenue.

We raise £13bn less than we spend.

7001 2018-11-10 23:21:24 Honestly wasn’t expecting the Rang-tan Iceland advert to put me through so many emotions ://// what’s palm oil in bc am not using it anymore !!!!!

7005 2018-11-10 23:21:09 Has fish oil supplementation been known to correlate to AF before? I know we are discussing RX concentration of EPA but have you encountered/suspected that fish oil could be attributed to patients AF in your practice?

7008 2018-11-10 23:20:40 I knew nothing about palm oil until I seen the advert
7009 2018-11-10 23:20:34 Wait.  Wasn't the food for oil thing basically what created Osama Bin Laden?  What is wrong with these idiots?
7010 2018-11-10 23:20:31 Yeah, they've been telling us that for DECADES. We were supposed to have run out of oil a long time ago. We don't believe you anymore.
7011 2018-11-10 23:20:25 Lol you can do it with a flat iron too. Just gotta apply the right tension and spray with a Moroccan oil or a light oil then wrap it with Saran Wrap & sit under a dryer for 10 minutes (or blow dryer)
7012 2018-11-10 23:20:14 Ok cool, hemp instead of oil,solar instead of coal, battery power instead of gas fired short term solutions. I'd love to make policy.

7026 2018-11-10 23:18:00 i just started the base layer for my painting and already mixed up acrylic and oil paints and ruined 2 paintbrushes. this is why i don't paint often.
7027 2018-11-10 23:17:43 Fake news. Everyone knows that Jeremy Corbyn is responsible for global palm oil production...
7028 2018-11-10 23:17:38 I never said it wasn’t, 26 million acres are lost to palm oil in addition to the 136 million acres lost due to livestock
7029 2018-11-10 23:17:22 Lets just post your home address then matthew yglesias
7030 2018-11-10 23:17:21 You still don't understand.
It's creating headlines and social awareness for an issue that is larger than what supermarket sells the most Christmas cake..
It's trying to make ppl aware, that we have the power to help.
Don't buy things that contain unsustainable palm oil
7031 2018-11-10 23:17:15 they are dolls of color they must be respected, unless they have oil or are from a US adversary , if they do we must support the anti revisionist socialist invasions of the US!
Oh yeah have you made sure to pay your Jacobin dues? It's imperative to the cause of socialism
7032 2018-11-10 23:17:13 Of course they will!! When your owned by an oil rich country rules don't matter #nuffsaid
7033 2018-11-10 23:17:11 2 trillion barrels of oil?

Use 86 million barrels of oil per day. 

24,000 days. 

Less than 3 generations. 

Whoosh
7034 2018-11-10 23:17:08 Next time 1: cook your meat until soft & set aside, 2: boil your veggies eg  make sure they r half cooked 3: in a large pot add oil, onion, tomato, peppers & your spices, saute for 5 min then add your meat back & veggies leave it to simmer for 20 min. Enjoy! 
7035 2018-11-10 23:17:02 Dixon:”nobody expects Nancy Pelosi+gang to support debt forgiveness for student loans, free college tuition, rent control, a living wage tied to actual prices, reining in the frackers and oil companies, or laws that would enable workers to organize unions and protect themselves”
7036 2018-11-10 23:16:57 Iceland's response to the not Xmassy enough criticism is that it delivers an important message about palm oil, enabling people to make the decision to have a palm oil free Xmas. Has to start somewhere, why not Xmas dinner - god knows it's when most of us overbuy& overeat!
7037 2018-11-10 23:16:49 Fiz is sounding more & more like a snake oil salesman every day I hope it anit so but a lot of things he said have not really been the deal...
7038 2018-11-10 23:16:48 Officially cutting out palm oil and meat from my life xx bye gals
7039 2018-11-10 23:16:47 I presume it was the junk-food manufacturers leaning on the tv companies. But you’re only removing palm oil from the stuff YOU sell. What about theirs? Hm?
7040 2018-11-10 23:16:39 .@Gorillas_Org @louisa1000 @IcelandFoods ...Africa stop this while you are ahead. Stop palm oil plantations!
7041 2018-11-10 23:16:37 Why was it banned. Pressure from suppliers of Palm Oil?
7042 2018-11-10 23:16:22 He pulled a Billary....
7043 2018-11-10 23:16:10 Even if that is the case, it still raises the awareness and people are more likely to buy palm oil free foods. It's a win win situation
7044 2018-11-10 23:16:09 lesser of the two evils can also be said about coal vs oil result to the planet is still the same. personal electric cars are stupid, are there to make the rich feel better about their consumption. gov giving rebates on teslas is really really stupid.
7045 2018-11-10 23:16:08 OiL prices will go up soon and whom to Blame? Oh Well You tell me. Arabs need Extra Billions of Dollars in their Bank accounts for sure.

7047 2018-11-10 23:15:51 Biotech twitter obsessing over adverse effects of mineral oil

Would be surprised if a tiny daily dose of mineral oil would be enough to create the huge effect size we saw in Reduce-it... Do wish they had picked another placebo though 

$amrn
7048 2018-11-10 23:15:48 Coast Guard, Air Ambulance, News Birds, Oil Tycoons, Crazy Former Cobra jocks who now fly agriculture (my first helo experience... Should have realized the Calvary hat the pilot was wearing was a hint it was going to be a fun ride) all fly in worse.
7049 2018-11-10 23:15:40 I found one w coconut oil in it for $10 shampoo+conditioner set so hopefully this works  ty for the rec!
7050 2018-11-10 23:15:27 So will FDA ask a new trial without mineral oil in the placebo?
7051 2018-11-10 23:15:25 The more we use the more we find. It took 31.77 hours of labor to buy one barrel of oil in 1980. Today it's less than 10. Prices have dropped by almost 70%. Never forget, Teslas run on fossil fuels with a long extension cords.
7052 2018-11-10 23:15:13 風邪気味のはずなのにほんとにお疲れ様。。。無理はし過ぎないようにがんばってね。。。
7053 2018-11-10 23:15:12 There is too much carbon dioxide and plenty of hydrogen in water, so all we need to do is make oil out of these. 
7054 2018-11-10 23:15:04 Caravan mainstream media. Snake oil peddlers.
7055 2018-11-10 23:15:03 This whole palm oil thing has got me thinking. @tesco loaf had palm oil so I put it back. I’m lucky I can buy more expensive alternatives. But not all can, so big corporations need to help protect the environment.
7056 2018-11-10 23:14:51 Yup... we've had enough.
7057 2018-11-10 23:14:44 Palm Oil is a huge problem too and is in a staggering amount of products.
7058 2018-11-10 23:14:43 i don’t have an oil cleanser that i actually trust ... trust no one not even ur own oils
7059 2018-11-10 23:14:35 Oil money in campaign funding thats why. Always follow the money.
7060 2018-11-10 23:14:33 HSBC The London-based bank is part of a group that provided over $16 billion (£13.2 billion) in loans and a further $2 billion (£1.7 billion) in corporate bonds to palm oil producers, according to Greenpeace International...
7061 2018-11-10 23:14:09 In briefing docs for previous Vascepa trial there were comments about the light mineral oil potentially raising LDL levels, but those were dismissed b/c they noted that in the similar Lovaza trial which did not use mineral oil they saw similar increases. Absorption is minimal.
7062 2018-11-10 23:14:04 And a day or a few days before my period i start taking CBD oil!
7063 2018-11-10 23:13:57 Is corn syrup like Olive Oil?
7064 2018-11-10 23:13:52 Don't worry, I've been corrected that oil is largely plankton, and there are fewer toy plankton. #whew
7065 2018-11-10 23:13:52 The fault has always been ours. We thought it is noble to keep quiet when we are being attacked; left, right & center. We don't have media, yet we can't use the little we have? We ve tolerated the sh*t so much, & it is time to dish it back.
7066 2018-11-10 23:13:47 ALL oils though?? I mean olive oil comes from olives and those are healthy. I only use avocado, olive, and safflower oil
7067 2018-11-10 23:13:46 Grass fed unsalted butter / spoon of mct oil/ blender for 10 sec til frothy ... 
7068 2018-11-10 23:13:43 If there's one thing I'm constantly amazed by, it's how quickly and how drastically sentiment can change.
Cramer called for $100 oil in September. He's now calling for $40 oil. Oil has moved from $75 to $60. #simmer

「７１０」を逆さにすると「ＯＩＬ」に見えるから。

OIL！
7070 2018-11-10 23:13:36 Someone already debunked that theory.  Mineral oil may have exaggerated the Vascepa effect a little, not enough to cast any doubt on the tremendous benefit shown.
7071 2018-11-10 23:13:31 That's exactly it. Especially if you were to break it down by hourly wages, it's not even peanuts, but the broken, trod upon husks of peanuts. I'm a faceless blip of data, a resource...to the oil barons that keeps their billions growing. That's what makes me mad.
7072 2018-11-10 23:13:23 Palm Oil is in vertically everything now it’s disgusting!
7073 2018-11-10 23:13:14 Need sleep. Think I’ll have some CBD oil to relax me 
7074 2018-11-10 23:13:00 I take reg fish oil everyday (8)  took cholesterol and triglyceride numbers right down!
7075 2018-11-10 23:12:44 Another possibility for the placebo to cause harm is a well known side effect of mineral oil - reduction in absorption of oil-soluble vitamins. The deficiency of one of these vitamins, D, has been associated with the increased risk of cardiovascular disease  $AMRN
7076 2018-11-10 23:12:38 Everyone on Twitter seems convinced 1) that you shouldn’t get worse outcomes with placebo 2) it must be “the mineral oil”. I’m not yet convinced. 1) why not? 2) why? Where’s the evidence for those two claims? $amrn

7084 2018-11-10 23:11:56 Mineral oil has proven not to be an issue.   FDA approved trial design after previous trials also included mineral oil.   It is a non-issue except to Forbes and a few others who did not get into the stock.
7085 2018-11-10 23:11:36 Can't believe this advert was banned, the problem is that Palm oil is in sooo many products you wouldn't even think of, it's such a huge problem
7086 2018-11-10 23:11:36 You should buy all the oil and delete it.
7087 2018-11-10 23:11:33 A delay of an oil tanker by a week brought the country to a halt. And you think it's possible to live in isolation?

7092 2018-11-10 23:10:36 FDA agreed with mineral oil
7093 2018-11-10 23:10:27 It actually is that simple. Cut production by no more that 5% and 7% respective for oil and natural, and double your revenue. Any CEO who can't get this through his mind and the boards mind, needs to be fired immediately.
7094 2018-11-10 23:10:19 Cbd oil works so well for me. I’d be lost without it!

7096 2018-11-10 23:10:07 My point is that both democrats and republicans all sleep in the same bed. They don't go to wars. They don't have to shoot or be shot at.

7099 2018-11-10 23:09:55 @CBDOilSolutions after alot of searching I found 2 oz bottle of 5000mg oil for $160.00. With half price offers I get it for $80.
7100 2018-11-10 23:09:54 いや、梅ラボ好きですって。
7101 2018-11-10 23:09:54 Who's going to repay the $500M and when will they start repaying it? 

$500M was just about N80B in 2013. Was that too much for the FG to invest in her major airports back then? Oil revenue was pretty high back then. Why borrow?
7102 2018-11-10 23:09:51 Aha....and I presume that you realised that a Placing will land soon!You want a proper oil company buy Rre or sqz!

7107 2018-11-10 23:08:53 You are literally a crank and a snake oil salesman. Go back to prescribing weed for dry skin or whatever it is you people do nowadays.
7108 2018-11-10 23:08:48 Existing reviews suggest Canada offers about $3 billion to companies to explore and produce oil and gas within Canada. Export Development Canada also finances oil production in other countries, spending almost $12 billion in 2016 and $10 billion in 2017 on foreign oil production
7109 2018-11-10 23:08:38 Jog on oil money I ain’t here to argue 
7110 2018-11-10 23:08:29 You should have had two oil changes by now
7111 2018-11-10 23:08:24 Looks like an oil sheen on the water in that pic.
7112 2018-11-10 23:08:20 got my oil changed today and the guy found $40 under my seat don’t think I’ve ever been happier
7113 2018-11-10 23:08:13 What are the harmful effects of mineral oil? It might loosen stools, but that’s it really. It cannot be absorbed through the intestines.
7114 2018-11-10 23:08:13 Here’s a tip from me to you my friends - if you make bacon (or some such other greasy thing), just leave the pan out until mid-afternoon, soak some bread in the oil, and fry it (both sides). A fun snack, pan is easier to clean, you don’t have grease to put in a jar in your fridge
7115 2018-11-10 23:08:07 Wait till you hear about the wars we are in for big oil... take one for the team and vote leftist. Use your money for leftists to grow.
7116 2018-11-10 23:08:02 Hmm, time to buy oil and other energy stocks.
7117 2018-11-10 23:07:54 Funny that @TheBodyShopUK have been highlighting and campaigning the palm oil and displacing wildlife issue for a few years but haven't got any coverage? Maybe they should have just done a Christmas advert? 
7118 2018-11-10 23:07:51 I life in France and I pay attention has not to buy products containing some palm oil but there is a lot of progress to be still made
7119 2018-11-10 23:07:45 If you’re finding yourself out of it often, you can find the scent oil and mix it with alcohol and water :)
7120 2018-11-10 23:07:41 This advert are something like targeting the Asian oil palm operators.  Don't think it's is political motivated
7121 2018-11-10 23:07:35 If you “find” enough votes things can change.
7122 2018-11-10 23:07:35 You can smell the ash in North Hollywood. Reminds me of oil fires in Iraq the sky.

7125 2018-11-10 23:06:39 West Texas Intermediate oil has been down for 10 consecutive days. The longest streak of daily drops since the launch of he benchmark in March 1983.
7126 2018-11-10 23:06:37 Mineral Oil is not well known to do any such thing.    This is BS.
7127 2018-11-10 23:06:25 Just keep driving down renewable energy costs @elonmusk. Fossil fuels won't simply run out, they'll just get more expensive as demand outpaced discovery and oil prices get too high to stay viable.
7128 2018-11-10 23:06:22 Beautiful! Is this an oil ?

7133 2018-11-10 23:05:58 What's happening is horrible, but do not think that dropping palm oil altogether is a fix - the reason it is used is because it's the most efficient oil crop in the world. The replacement needs to be sustainable, not just another disaster.
7134 2018-11-10 23:05:39 STOP USING AN PRODUCTS WITH PALM OIL. YOU'RE KILL HOMES STOP IT
7135 2018-11-10 23:05:35 Apparently most of my fave brands contain palm oil 
7136 2018-11-10 23:05:34 I never understood the whole coconut oil trend
7137 2018-11-10 23:05:23 Okay. Palm oil is used in what types of products? I'll stop using them. I prefer orangutans live in their forests and not our zoos.
7138 2018-11-10 23:05:15 I've been trying to avoid palm oil as much as possible... thing is, they put it almost everything... 
7139 2018-11-10 23:05:10 That All Bab makeshift refinery site also is stacking tons of oil trucks
7140 2018-11-10 23:05:00 I just found out my mom reuses the oil she cooks with... Is that normal? Because i think thats gross
7141 2018-11-10 23:04:38 It’s not that hard to understand that it’s about the way it is harvested and so if people stop buying it they are taking a stand against the the harmful ways we mass harvest instead of the palm oil itself.
7142 2018-11-10 23:04:32 I've been trying to avoid palm oil for years. Iceland is my local shop. Win win as far as I'm concerned. Well done  Iceland
7143 2018-11-10 23:04:19 Yeah, please oh wise one tell the oil companies how to make money. They have been printing cash, generating earnings and paying dividends for a hundred years. Something you will never experience.
7144 2018-11-10 23:04:07 This is how bear markets play out. It may seem prices have recovered, but $60-$70 oil is still a challenge. Commodity prices are out of their control. All they can do is re-adjust to the new conditions, and we've seen many are managing. Don't confuse sentiment with valuation.
7145 2018-11-10 23:04:05 You need to show oil companies ways to make more money in green energy than oil then thing will change.  Or advocate for no public investment in funds with oil companies - either feed them or starve them to influence.
7146 2018-11-10 23:04:05 In August I asked @Tesco @asda @sainsburys @waitrose @Morrisons whether they would follow @IcelandFoods lead regarding removing palm oil from their own brand products. Not one responded, with the banned advert now highlighting the affects palm oil   causes, may I ask you again?
7147 2018-11-10 23:04:03 That's what's puzzling to me, wtf would they agree to mineral oil as placebo if there was a risk of affecting results. This is inexcusable.
7148 2018-11-10 23:04:00 DO YOU PUT OIL IN NOODLE WATER!?

7164 2018-11-10 23:02:29 Exactly... FDA agreed on mineral oil. So will they ask now a new trial? Difficult
7165 2018-11-10 23:02:25 They probably don't talk to you because you have routinely over hyped up doubt. To wit: "..with Big Caveats"

You're, aware that FDA approved mineral oil as placebo, and that NEJM had nowhere near the concern about it that you're showing. 

Who pays you for the hit pieces?
7166 2018-11-10 23:02:12 I'm going to say a thing that I can't believe has to be said... Drink Water! Just do it! I don't care if it has no taste, or if pop or alcohol tastes better, you need to drink water! Water is the oil that runs our vehicle of a body, just drink it!

This has been my TED talk.
7167 2018-11-10 23:02:06 Well next time, ask before you wipe ancient sex ritual oil my face.
7168 2018-11-10 23:02:02 Beautiful commercial. A sad story, it’s important to share it with the world. I’m from Argentina and I didn’t know about the disaster that palm oil industries does to the nature.
7169 2018-11-10 23:02:00 Well done to Iceland. I will be supporting you and shopping in your stores knowing that you have taken the step to ban palm oil. Good for you and thankyou!
7170 2018-11-10 23:01:59 Aaaaand currently soaking my eyes in coconut oil to get these things off my lashes. So fucking ugly, why do people do this?  Waste of money, sure. But it was fun I guess?
7171 2018-11-10 23:01:56 That’s about as likely as oil going down ten days in a row...
7172 2018-11-10 23:01:54 PLEASE let Jeff SnowFlake run against DJT!!!....I would LOVE to see the POTUS “embarrass” this snake oil salesmen for ALL the harm he has done during his term in the Senate during only 1 debate !!!
7173 2018-11-10 23:01:54 PTI was absolutely right. In PMLN govt the prices decreased to even $40 for brent crude. In July they were at $72 & right now at $70. in oct they went to $86 so as a result govt decreased sales tax to maintain price. Now whn v buy oil at $70 it will decrease in 1-2 months

7175 2018-11-10 23:01:41 If you've seen orangutans, you will no doubt have spoken to indigenous peoples in those areas tòo. So you will know these good ppl have no other income but that brought by palm oil etc. It feeds/educates their kids, etc.  We must help orangutans but these ppl need our support too
7176 2018-11-10 23:01:37 22% triglyceride reduction can not explain EPA benefit. Good baseline LDLc/HDLc (after intense statins) and maybe "mineral oil" negative contribute to Epa positive.  OTC EPA should benefit the most from data presented. $AMRN

7187 2018-11-10 22:59:41 I stopped once again and turned my attention towards her. 

“Yes?” 

Brushing back my blonde locks as I wipe oil from my hands upon my towel. 

I hated being a vampire, the way I was changed and why was always something crossing my mind.
7188 2018-11-10 22:59:33 Mr Mahindra, crude oil prices in 
2015 - 52.32,
 2016-43.74, 
2017 -  54.17 
we have been there nothing helped. Now difference is elections are round the corner but no time span left to review the sentiment . Opportunity is already lost.
7189 2018-11-10 22:59:28 They’ve rounded it. And it tastes of coconut oil
7190 2018-11-10 22:59:24 Dad: have you ever seen how they turn oil into gasoline?

Me: don't think so.

Dad: well I see all these cars on the road and I just wonder how much oil there is in the ground.

Me: not a lot........that's why we're trying to conserve it...

7193 2018-11-10 22:59:13 From what I read you can't argue a recount if some one wins by 50% or better in Georgia. Kemp got over 50% of the votes. This case is closed.

7198 2018-11-10 22:58:42 I always check the products I buy and if I see palm oil in the ingredients I do not buy the products. Saw documentaries on how they collect palm oil early last year and it got me deciding not to use products with palm oil. So many products use it it is scary.

7203 2018-11-10 22:57:42 I have a crazy idea. Don't donate your money to candidates who engage in this behavior, the @GOP. Maybe instead fund research to help advance energy tech breakthroughs. And maybe candidates who support renewables and oppose expanded oil exploration. But what do I know?

7208 2018-11-10 22:57:35 Well done. Please keep putting your actions before PR. To that end, can you increase the range of products without palm oil sooner rather than later.
7209 2018-11-10 22:57:26 @JindrichBayer I would love more info on your Oil and where I can find it. Greatly appreciated 
7210 2018-11-10 22:57:25 You keep denying global warming, this is the reason for all these forest fires! You can't sell off all of our forest to your Mining and oil interest friends. That's not going to solve the problem.

7220 2018-11-10 22:56:09 I've used water with an oil concoction that I made up. Works fine.
7221 2018-11-10 22:56:09 Was originally a Greenpeace advert, which Iceland had permission to use and rebrand.  Launched this month as Iceland have now confirmed that their stores no longer stock palm oil products - not Xmas just timing.
7222 2018-11-10 22:56:07 Yay rocket snake oil salesmen? Or bad documentation?
7223 2018-11-10 22:56:03 Coconut oil is bomb af 
7224 2018-11-10 22:55:47 The oil isn't stolen more like giving away.too many still bow to Westminster.
7225 2018-11-10 22:55:25 Well that makes them both dinosaurs and asteroid. Not looking good for the oil execs.
7226 2018-11-10 22:55:25 Liberals don’t need oil, they take the bus.
7227 2018-11-10 22:55:24 Well canola oil, which is high in linoleic acid, is not placebo like either

7229 2018-11-10 22:55:11 AND we swapped out half the oil for an overripe banana. So we got some fruit in there. Health Food. it's science ;)
7230 2018-11-10 22:55:09 Haiti has iridium. Iridium is the most valuable metal in the world. Haiti has more oil than Venezuala. Haiti is the only people that rejected Colonization. Is Iridium Vibranium? Is Wakanda Haiti??????
7231 2018-11-10 22:55:03 Thinking long term has never been oil company's strong suit. They want it, all of it, and they want it now. To hell with future generations. They're not going to be here.

7235 2018-11-10 22:54:45 Very interesting point, Patrick. 

Could explain increase in LDL in mineral oil placebo arm -- "STABLE statin therapy"

Bempedoic acid for highest risk to reduce LDL when statin-intolerant or statins don't do enough.

Then, Vascepa after LDLs are in the right range.

Got to get back to work full-time plus over-time yeh I know been told not to BUT not sure how it will go and how exhausted il be but I need heating oil and have none and winter is here. If I get enough hours in I might get some if not I'll be very cold 
7238 2018-11-10 22:54:10 Idk how "explanation unclear for the outlier"
Pretty clear its either 1) high dose 2) EPA only 3) very careful patient selection 4) mineral oil effect (this ones new to me)
I wouldnt call this a fluke false positive or even outlier, bc trial design is so diff from prev studies

7241 2018-11-10 22:53:42 Definitely. Me too. Another good thing about all that oil money; best legal representatives money can buy 
7242 2018-11-10 22:53:41 And create an oil slick worse than the Valdez. Do you want that? Because that's what would happen.
7243 2018-11-10 22:53:40 That’s the whole point of reduce, reuse, recycle. Once enough batteries have been produced, they can keep getting recycled so that we don’t need to keep mining for new resources, or at least keep new mining at an absolute minimum.

No such path for oil.
7244 2018-11-10 22:53:38 What about all of the other byproducts from oil that are used in everyday life?  Gonna be shell shock to a lot of people...

7247 2018-11-10 22:53:09 Every time I see people talking, I assume they are talking about pineapple on pizza, cbd oil, red dead redemption, avocado toast, Trump or just saying "I'M DEAD!" back and forth to each other because the internet and real life have become the same.
7248 2018-11-10 22:53:07 Second that. Meaningful or not? and why didn't they use, like, canola oil?
7249 2018-11-10 22:52:37 Looks like papadom IN Hot oil

7261 2018-11-10 22:51:38 The problem is I have too much oil. Or maybe I'm not doing it right.
7262 2018-11-10 22:51:31 So my new thing is to massage Olbas oil into my chest and neck as it helps me breathe; also nobody wants to come near me when I have it on so it's a win-win.

7291 2018-11-10 22:48:14 So happy I got an oil change today!
7292 2018-11-10 22:48:09 i swear by tea tree oil as a spot treatment because i had a massive pimple last night, applied it with a q-tip, and it shrunk bigggg time wow
7293 2018-11-10 22:48:05 FDA called for mineral oil people.
7294 2018-11-10 22:47:54 Some went as low as trading derogatory insults, but we move and give them silent treatment.
7295 2018-11-10 22:47:50 Ba mu qara yin shuru. Nobody has monopoly of narratives in this country.
7296 2018-11-10 22:47:31 Agreed. Wall Street will continue to influence oil production even though everything points to the burning of gas as the largest contributer of climate change spewing extreme levels of carbon dioxide it won’t change.  Important reason why you have to make Tesla successful.
7297 2018-11-10 22:47:31 You want to reduce greenhouse gases stop polluting the ground water and focus on switching to solar and wind generation and eliminate the oil and gas industry forever. You should be fined for every fall of oil you pull out not profiting from it.
7298 2018-11-10 22:47:25 Lovely!! I sautée the red pepper flakes and Celtic gray sea salt add the garlic, sauté it for a while, then add the broccoli rabe with just the water clinging to the leaves from rinsing, toss to coat it in oil, reduce the heat, cover, and steam it a bit.
7299 2018-11-10 22:47:09 Coffee is the second most traded commodity on Earth after oil.
7300 2018-11-10 22:47:06 A lot of the folks who are burning the midnight oil continuously and have burnouts as a metric are in it for the money. Business/expertise is a long term game. We celebrate quick wins rather than long term gains, this changes culture in a sickly way.
7301 2018-11-10 22:46:56 I qualified for the free oven mitt and cinnamon bark oil, but they weren’t in the package. Only the three oils I had ordered. Are they coming separately?
7302 2018-11-10 22:46:54 @LindaFoods You can’t “care” about animals and then use palm oil. If you cannot list is as sustainable then its not sustainable.
7303 2018-11-10 22:46:44 I thought I smelled canola oil, because someone just got fried
7304 2018-11-10 22:46:39 The oil company money people started the story we going to run out of oil in the 1880,s that way they could keep up the price, problem is, every time they say we are going to run out, proven reserves go up by a factor of 10
7305 2018-11-10 22:46:37 Coconut oil in my hair wine in my hand 
7306 2018-11-10 22:46:29 Rape oil... 
7307 2018-11-10 22:46:26 "Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far …" @elonmusk
7308 2018-11-10 22:46:26 good morning
7309 2018-11-10 22:46:25 And allowing endangered species to be hunted, and drilling for oil on our beautiful coastal areas, and wanting to sell national parks, and not taking responsibility for his past rape/sexual assaults and for countless other atrocities.
7310 2018-11-10 22:46:25 That out every weekend thing isn’t for me man lmaoo.... know folks who do it Friday/Saturday/Sunday...  more engine oil to your elbow....
7311 2018-11-10 22:46:24 With profit based incentives, Malibu beach houses, and of course oil is big money, renewable energy still uncertain, oil bosses will not rush to embrace sustainability! Eat now, worry later.
7312 2018-11-10 22:46:20 Get an oil change
7313 2018-11-10 22:46:19 Some even came to my DM .
7314 2018-11-10 22:46:10 Without oil we are living in the stone age.  All the things that make your life easier are gonzo, including the device you used for this tweet...
7315 2018-11-10 22:46:00 Moderate Real Salt Intake, 80 Ounces Of Water Per Day, In Winter (More Salt & Oil), Plenty Of Rest, Don’t Eat Heavy Foods Late ( Gives Kidneys Et Al Digestive Parts Time To Digest Foods Overnight) & Avoid Stress.
7316 2018-11-10 22:45:45 Very small heat fa, with latent heat of fusion  that is very negligible . Sometimes, we ve to keep every norm aside & do it there way. Seems that is the only language they understand.
7317 2018-11-10 22:45:43 Getting my oil changed was the only productive thing I’ve done all day.
7318 2018-11-10 22:45:31 I have no idea how market will react after that placebo mineral oil news. No position, Good luck to you 
7319 2018-11-10 22:45:29 I dont know success rate, but CBD oil is supposed 2 help w PTSD.
7320 2018-11-10 22:45:21 So major palm oil users Kellogs and Unilever for example had no sway in the screening of this advert?????
7321 2018-11-10 22:45:11 I hate synthetic oil bruh so expensive
7322 2018-11-10 22:45:06 Because you are such an oil king ledge Joshua, Opec has got nothing on you!
7323 2018-11-10 22:45:03 Elon I have never seen so many people talk negatively about someone who has done more than anyone I can think of to help humanity. My question is do you really want to help these people?? It's like they hope no one helps and we stay on oil forever... useless critics
7324 2018-11-10 22:44:57 Can only imagine it's political if certain politicians are involved with companies in the palm oil industry, otherwise it isn't 
7325 2018-11-10 22:44:54 I'm sure Middle East oil had something to do with our reaction.
7326 2018-11-10 22:44:53 That first picture looks like an oil painting. Just beautiful
7327 2018-11-10 22:44:41 Just wait the new all demo rat  ‘s in Santa Fe will put a stop to the progress by regulations. And heavy state taxes on the oil industry.
7328 2018-11-10 22:44:36 Why does it say ‘Moron Oil’ behind Ricky?
7329 2018-11-10 22:44:36 Buy all of the beard oil and control the market for it lmao
7330 2018-11-10 22:44:32 Is there really no way to use the chemical energy in oil and gas other than burning it, to provide power or a clean/renewable use to the world ?? you can figure it out !
7331 2018-11-10 22:44:32 No one has ever died for the flag. No one. You think the soldiers in Germany and Vietnam said "I'm gonna get in a gun battle with the enemy because I like that piece of cloth so darn much!" Bullshit. They died for ideals, or oil, or to stop fascism or because they were drafted
7332 2018-11-10 22:44:30 Great job
by the way I think it's a case that should be worked on more alot with deeper analysis , The big question is how ISIS purchased its ( in some cases modern) ammunition & equipment , Second about the buyers of ISIS's oil specially in Iraq , Anyway thank you a million
7333 2018-11-10 22:44:29 Cabinet approves filling of Padur Strategic Petroleum Reserves at Padur, Karnataka by overseas National Oil Companies
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi has approved the filling of Padur Strategic Petroleum Reserves(SPR) at Padur
7334 2018-11-10 22:44:28 Snake oil is not profitable.
7335 2018-11-10 22:44:15 Should be at Mr. P’s like all the real fans @TheBorginator
7336 2018-11-10 22:44:08 They said the same word long ago but, still black gold  is energy power.
They said  Coal , Gas , clean power will be used instead of oil but still the oil is Oil.
7337 2018-11-10 22:44:02 True. I’ve said that for ages. I think Eck being an oil economist etc did have some credibility with hard headed business types but I fear Nicola comes across more like what they would see as a Labour type person
7338 2018-11-10 22:43:55 Do you not think the hunt for oil sorry 'war on terror'might have cost a lot of resources and lives?
7339 2018-11-10 22:43:50 No, no. It was support in the CENTCOM AO that was not similar in other areas. The squeakest wheel gets the oil.
7340 2018-11-10 22:43:44 Don’t tell him as he will cut Down trees to mine coal, oil wells, and hotels!
7341 2018-11-10 22:43:40 Lol...same folk ignoring engine lights and driveways coverd in oil! 
7342 2018-11-10 22:43:34 Whoah! Dreamt I was in a warehouse with some rando & for no reason he started wiping stuff on my face. I like huh? He said it’s vegetable oil, sundried tomato & Parmesan. I said I’m not into that, or you & he goes you will be, it’s an ancient sexual ritual. WHAT?! 
7343 2018-11-10 22:43:31 You clearly don’t know anything about Venezuela. Venezuela failed because their entire economy was oil driven. When the price of oil dropped so did the economy. Then Castro died and his predecessor had no idea how to run a country. That’s why Venezuela is the way it is now.
7344 2018-11-10 22:43:29 Peace in troublesome times is more than peace.

"Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over." Psalm 23:5 KJV
7345 2018-11-10 22:43:22 then do smth with that oil of yours and get some money for me
7346 2018-11-10 22:43:00 @IcelandFoods I am completely behind the sentiment of the ad. Can't agree more. But @IcelandFoods I just wonder how may of the products you sell would be made with palm oil? Is this just a publicity stunt or legit??? Food for thought........
7347 2018-11-10 22:42:56 Wondering about all those plastic components we are using. They are made of oil too!!
7348 2018-11-10 22:42:55 I have an idea:
1: geneticly engineer dinosaurs (and catgirls just for the sake of it, also gimme one for the idea please)
2: kill the dinosaurs
3: make oil out of them
Its a bit genocide but itll work allright, we won't run out of dead dinosaurs
7349 2018-11-10 22:42:48 That oil money is rlly something else
7350 2018-11-10 22:42:46 And, Palm oil causes health issues in humans.
7351 2018-11-10 22:42:46 BEER NEWS High Street: @NoCoastBrewCo Pranqster, @prairieales Deconstructed Bomb! Vanilla, @ElevationBeerCo Oil Man 2015!
7352 2018-11-10 22:42:37 I am ready for this. But my oil, cubes, and money isn't.
7353 2018-11-10 22:42:29 Hopefully Woodcroft has more patience and teaching ability than TM.  Love to see Coach Q in Oil Country!
7354 2018-11-10 22:42:20 IKEA should sell CBD oil meatballs.
7355 2018-11-10 22:42:16 Coffee is the second most traded commodity on Earth after oil.
7356 2018-11-10 22:42:16 If you seriously think that price is all in thanks to @fordnation then you my dear are an idiot. Oil prices are at their lowest this year.  @fordnation has absolutely nothing to do with that price whatsoever! He is a liar and a thief!
7357 2018-11-10 22:42:13 $AMRN FDA will ask for another trial with proper placebo control.  And that will end this snake oil nonsense
7358 2018-11-10 22:42:13 2/2 There is no point berating oil companies for doing what they do. Consumers have power, stop using, or limit as much as you can, the products of those companies. The sooner oil demand starts to fall the sooner the transition happens.
7359 2018-11-10 22:42:09 "What honey, you paid MSRP? Did you storm out of the sales room three times asking for another $1000 off? No? Did you at least get some free oil changes?"
7360 2018-11-10 22:42:02 I just ate an oil infused chocolate bar called train wreck.  I've never felt so fucking stupid in my life as I do right now. I think I just killed every brain cell I had left.
7361 2018-11-10 22:41:50 Wasabi, peppers have oil that sticks to your tongue whereas wasabi is instantaneous
7362 2018-11-10 22:41:46 Today’s guilty grocery store buy - Kraft dinner. Minor atonement by making with olive oil.
7363 2018-11-10 22:41:36 yup, i toast the garlic to a nice golden brown in the oil, then add the crushed pepper to bring out the flavor, then add the par-boiled rabe and cook, then add some maldon salt flakes to serve it....It is delicious
7364 2018-11-10 22:41:36 Oil didn't come from dinosaurs!
7365 2018-11-10 22:41:24 It’s two, at least, problems. Production.  Distribution. T Boone switched from oil to water. Sitting on a mondo aquifer in the panhandle.
7366 2018-11-10 22:41:18 @rileypeacock55 Us at the express oil place in Destin when that mechanic was making moves at that lady.
7367 2018-11-10 22:41:15 So I tried CBD oil coffee today. Just a tiny two ounce cup, but.

Holy shit did I feel it. Had a major effect on my pain levels
7368 2018-11-10 22:41:12 TIL mineral oil is a poison that causes heart attacks.  
7369 2018-11-10 22:41:08 Literally every oil change spot closed
7370 2018-11-10 22:41:02 Lol nice zone
7371 2018-11-10 22:40:55 It's crazy that we value cheap oil (which is proved to be harmful to our health, btw) more than the preservation of the environment and the survival of an animal species...
7372 2018-11-10 22:40:50 The only bad thing about working in the oil field is missing all the college football games... beeelowwss
7373 2018-11-10 22:40:44 The 26% inflation of the 70's was caused by the tory chancellor and the oil producers. The trade unions had to fight to protect their members living standards. In Germany, Bosses and Unions work together  co-operatively. In UK Govt vilifies workers. Who was to blame again?
7374 2018-11-10 22:40:43 寝る前の記憶が…:( ;´꒳`;):
7375 2018-11-10 22:40:25 So, mineral oil will be banned immediately?
7376 2018-11-10 22:40:24 Unfortunately palm oil is everywhere.
7377 2018-11-10 22:40:15 So apparently most items we consume contain palm oil. I'm not really sure where to start if I want to change 
7378 2018-11-10 22:40:07 Praying for you to #BringItHome as grandma's anointing oil is still working! Praying for @nikkifried @SenBillNelson @NelsonForSenate and the other races too!

7380 2018-11-10 22:39:53 “an acre of old chaparral is the fuel equivalent of 75 barrels of crude oil”
7381 2018-11-10 22:39:48 Buhari's NLNG train 7 project is the only chance Nigeria has to diversify our economy from crude oil to gas, the foreign reserve he saved solved dollar shortages of which traders and manufacturers now have unfettered access to forex,
7382 2018-11-10 22:39:45 Once the oil dependance goes their money power also goes and this blind administration also will disappear. We mimic west becoz of their economic success.
7383 2018-11-10 22:39:44 In 1950’s “experts” insisted the world oil supply would vanish. Seventy years later the world has 2X’s the oil reserves identified in the 50’s. Energy Department was created because “experts” insisted natural gas reserves in the U S would be at zero by 1990. Now, 100 year supply.
7384 2018-11-10 22:39:32 Are you really this stupid Rump? Breaking news you orange idiot!!! California has been dealing with a drought. You are making it worse with your coal and oil garbage. No such thing as global warming? You really are as stupid as you look and sound.
7385 2018-11-10 22:39:32 I did that as well haha. Use the heart to see if a guy e.g. beats his wife, then lure him into a nice little trap to get exploded by whale oil
7386 2018-11-10 22:39:30 Bones don’t turn to oil
7387 2018-11-10 22:39:10 I don’t understand how we as a nation can transport liquids like oil and gas from state to state....but still haven’t figured out how to transport excess fresh water from states like NY, NJ and FL to states like AZ, NV or CA?
7388 2018-11-10 22:39:00 I honestly don't even know why that Iceland Christmas ad was banned cos all it was doing was promoting awareness on how our dependence on using palm oil in our everyday products is destroying the planet. That's capitalism for ya!
7389 2018-11-10 22:38:58 So docs are going to tell patients, “well, there is a drug that can cut your chance of a heart attack by 25%, but due to something about mineral oil, I will not prescribe. Sorry.”
7390 2018-11-10 22:38:55 The greater fight is seizing evry factory, field, oil field, farm, wind farm, server farm, forest, mill, mine. Health injustices r an expression of these patriarchal colonial imperial capitalist property relations. U know this. Amjal knows this. I know this. Were just debate rhtc
7391 2018-11-10 22:38:50 that's sounds awful, and a lot like Tillrays products here...if you have data on the oil, I'm sure you can find it from some other manufacturer as well - and their composition and everything else should be available
7392 2018-11-10 22:38:46 This is a BS answer there are plenty of brands who use sustainabily sourced palm oil, if you can’t list it then it’s not sustainable!! Stop with the fancy words bc its lies!!!  @LindaFoods
7393 2018-11-10 22:38:39 Sesame oil is a flavor from the gods
7394 2018-11-10 22:38:35 1/2 As a geologist in the oil business yes we do care, and some of us realise that it is an industry about to enter a terminal decline. However right now the energy we provide is still vital to humankind, it is frustrating as an individual to be criticised for this.
7395 2018-11-10 22:38:31 the oil industry spend $31 million to destroy a plan that was designed to fight climate change...the the president had the nerve to say that the california fires are occurring for “no reason,” america is in a major political crisis followed by economic crises for the working.
7396 2018-11-10 22:38:15 Have you ever tried CBD oil?
7397 2018-11-10 22:38:12 did u know his grandmother used to put oil in the shape of a cross on his forehead
7398 2018-11-10 22:38:00 I don’t understand how we as a nation can transport liquids like oil and gas from state to state....but still haven’t figured out how to transport excess fresh water from states like NY, NJ and FL to states like AZ, NV or CA?
7399 2018-11-10 22:37:57 Since that yesterday fa under Elrufais tweet, they've bn disturbing my peace, they never knew we could remember and escalate this , they think everyone is suffering from amnesia.
 Well they're getting a taste of their medicine.
7400 2018-11-10 22:37:48 Hey @realDonaldTrump instead of sending oil from one country to another using a pipeline, how about you Send water from one flooded side of America to the burning side? Where's the money in saving lives? Where's the sleep in letting them die? Too real @schizosurfer too political?
7401 2018-11-10 22:37:48 Academics do publish for grant money as oil industry makes decisions in self-interest.
7402 2018-11-10 22:37:39 Doesn't Alaska have oil reserves?
7403 2018-11-10 22:37:22 Peter I value ur opinion. U impressed w $amrn data? Or are you on the fence Bc of the pbo issue w mineral oil? Thanks
7404 2018-11-10 22:37:17 How can you write a accurate news piece if there is no data to back it up?
7405 2018-11-10 22:37:10 Asphalt is a very close cousin to the bunker oil used to fuel almost all of the world's ocean-going shipping - darn near the same thing - so it shouldn't be too surprising that it burns. What's surprising is that it caught fire because it's hard to get started. Stay safe!
7406 2018-11-10 22:37:04 Giving them a list of permissible & impermissible search terms should speed things up. 
‘Darling, lovey, sweetie, just search for ‘infidelity’ & ‘my wife’s not home’. Put your mind at ease. But you’ll just be wasting your time looking for ‘hot baby oil’ & ‘anal sex’ in them txts.
7407 2018-11-10 22:37:00 Coffee is the second most traded commodity on Earth after oil.
7408 2018-11-10 22:37:00 Prospect for oil at the Newseum.
7409 2018-11-10 22:36:59 I went and got my oil changed. I love when you don't have any other problems
7410 2018-11-10 22:36:53 I really do appreciate it and I don't consume much palm oil myself its a good campaign.. I just don't understand this selective choice of which animals deserve to die and which don't
7411 2018-11-10 22:36:30 Publicity stunt .Iceland sell hundreds of products with palm oil in .Clever oh and this mum dosent go to Iceland .
7412 2018-11-10 22:36:20 They didnt see us get mad when they were insulting elrufai but can't take small heat
7413 2018-11-10 22:36:17 Here's a conspiracy idea for your next insane tweet, Trump. Fire started by powerline falling on leaky oil pipeline. If you don't want to use this one, at least stop blaming victims and heroes.
7414 2018-11-10 22:36:16 the only way i’ll accept olive oil as its own thing is if it’s also with balsamic vinegar with bread but by itself god no
7415 2018-11-10 22:36:07 Well before gas ( As I'm sure you know Sir ) Most cars ran from Electric & Cities had Electric Trolley systems in place. Then Comes in John D. Rockefeller & Standard oil & it's subsidiaries to rip all that out in favor of businesses they owned (Oil) It's time we went back.
7416 2018-11-10 22:36:03 Vice’s Snapchat story featuring a bunch of leftists telling you to vote is interrupted with an ad for an oil company lmao
7417 2018-11-10 22:35:56 I'll try almost anything to help with my headaches. Today I decided on CBD oil. We'll see how it goes. #hydrocephalus
#chronicpain #quietcondition
7418 2018-11-10 22:35:55 Baban Fatima muna gaida kai
7419 2018-11-10 22:35:21 What is palm oil and what products have it?
7420 2018-11-10 22:35:17 You know what's worse than spilling your grinded flower?

Accidentally spilling #cannabis oil!  especially during a shortage!
7421 2018-11-10 22:35:14 Haha actually this kind of shows some serious stupidity @elonmusk. You really thought oil comes from dead dinosaurs????
7422 2018-11-10 22:34:58 Dinner: 
Salad w/homemade raspberry dressing
Braised corn kernels
Chicken salad with sesame seeds and oil
Homemade ciabatta toast with homemade hummus spread

I'm full.
I wonder if I should go get ice cream....................
7423 2018-11-10 22:34:53 my Grandma used to party sometimes at the Victory Motel. Played the ponies at Hollywood Park and Santa Anita. Oil well in the backyard, cars on the lawn. Dick Stensland was the sales manager at the syndicate telemarketing shop that put me on the phones when I was 20. Metals
7424 2018-11-10 22:34:42 Lmao the work bathroom reeks of oil carts. Someone's been lighting the fuck up in here
7425 2018-11-10 22:34:33 If i break your heart na oil spillage
7426 2018-11-10 22:34:30 Yep oil and coal.  Lots and lots of subsidy.
7427 2018-11-10 22:34:23 Oil
7428 2018-11-10 22:34:18 I hope these cheeses are "Palm-oil free." Thank you. :-) There is no need to use palm oil whatsoever. It just causes destruction, and is bad karma for all who use it and contribute to the use of it. 
7429 2018-11-10 22:34:13 TUMERIC, LEMONGRASS, CBD OIL, FRANKISCENCE OIL, CLOCE OIL, OREGANO OIL...
7430 2018-11-10 22:34:11 Never 'run out'.Will always be oil that's uneconomical to extract at the time. Better technology and higher prices may change that. See fracking. The bulk of BEVs are charged with electricity generated from the combustion of fossil fuels that release CO2 into the atmosphere
7431 2018-11-10 22:34:03 Going electric is the way to go and is the future. But we have to slowly transition into it. The Gas and Oil industries will greatly be effected if we make the transition right away. Look at all the businesses that will shut down and all the jobs people will lose.
7432 2018-11-10 22:33:54 @EU_Commission those who are been killed ever day without the government permitting the media from publishing them are bigger than the number of people who died in the first world  #war  Biafra #Referendum is all we need, one Nigeria Ian a British scam because of Biafra oil
7433 2018-11-10 22:33:52 Presumably everyone up in arms about palm oil production after seeing Iceland’s ad, will stop eating chocolate, pizza, bread, crisps, etc and using shower gels, shampoo and soap, all of which contain it. It’s in everything. We need to start reading more labels.
7434 2018-11-10 22:33:45 i’ll accept olive oil and crusty bread but even then, i’d prefer butter 
7435 2018-11-10 22:33:37 Amazon definitely needs to go the way of Standard Oil at this point
7436 2018-11-10 22:33:35 The WWF points out that you can get certified sustainable palm oil which is less environmentally destructive than palm oil alternatives which require a much greater area than palm oil in which to grow. It’s not entirely a black and white issue.
7437 2018-11-10 22:33:33 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
7438 2018-11-10 22:33:32 I almost hate auto correct... of course I meant DONT BUY PALM OIL!!!! Carry On
7439 2018-11-10 22:33:26 Keep Cheney and dubya in your thoughts when you think of war making.  9/11 attack was their excuse to go into Iraq for oil, yet it was 19 Saudis on those planes.
7440 2018-11-10 22:33:23 You have @spittinchiclets cbd oil now?
7441 2018-11-10 22:33:21 I don’t understand how we as a nation can transport dense liquids like oil and gas from state to state....but still haven’t figured out how to transport excess fresh water from states like NY, NJ and FL to states like AZ, NV or CA?  
7442 2018-11-10 22:33:17 That supposed to be an answer re thawing permafrost? There is a guy selling refrigration to keep the ground under oil production platforms frozen so the platform won’t be destroyed by thawing permafrost! In Canada a river got dammed by a mudslide from thawing permafrost!
7443 2018-11-10 22:33:05 DJTJ should be applying mineral oil to his asshole (the one on his ass, not his dad). It will make the coming penetration a bit easier on the old rose bud.
7444 2018-11-10 22:33:05 Wandering around Walmart for an hour and a half while they change my oil and I feel like I'm in hell
7445 2018-11-10 22:32:53 Why not set it in Louisiana? Rad crawdads, a few (possibly functioning) oil fields, a river delta, mutant voodoo cults, a river delta where the 'pharoahs' live in big, crumbling plantation houses. Fighting off airboat raiders & listening to ghouls talk bout old world BBQ.
7446 2018-11-10 22:32:40 I will now be looking for items with palm oil in them and boycotting them and will stop shopping in stores that sell goods with palm oil in their products

7448 2018-11-10 22:32:36 EXACTLY. olive oil is an INGREDIENT not a sauce/dressing/topping??????
7449 2018-11-10 22:32:31 Was just going to write ‘exactly what does ‘sustainable palm oil’ mean?” Will read the Greenpeace link....
7450 2018-11-10 22:32:04 Interesting that you use one myth”dinosaurs are not oil” to perpetuate another.
7451 2018-11-10 22:31:53 I love my oil cleanser!
7452 2018-11-10 22:31:45 erik loves to tell me 100x a day I need my oil changed, need air in my tires & to get my transmission checked yet still makes me drive everywhere knowing damn well I haven’t done any of them????? men are so ????
7453 2018-11-10 22:31:36 That’s all I use or find a tea tree oil conditioner from Target or something
7454 2018-11-10 22:31:24 the only time i put only olive oil on something is when i put it in a pan to cook something

that’s it

7457 2018-11-10 22:31:11 One day the black gold will be useless so as they for the snakes that rule the world, because they know that oil is not the future if they want the baby snakes to prosper and then in a short time It will resume to a few decades of luxury and cruelty by a forgotten kingdom
7458 2018-11-10 22:31:08 YYC is MISSING $12 BILLION that's in missed property tax income (reported in the Calgary Sun Paper).
 No oil, No staff,No tax income!
NO jobs. No $$$ & no Olympics either unless there's SHENANIGANS occurring.90% say NO if 65% say yes, shenanigans
Still no reason to move here.
7459 2018-11-10 22:31:06  I ve been batltikg with them for the last 48 hours simply because I reiterated that singe point stated by Elrufai. Now they won't let me rest , but I won't give up too.
7460 2018-11-10 22:31:05 The US is now, thanks to Trump, the number one oil producer in the world. Under Obama,  Saudi Arabia had America over a barrel (pun intended) because of their reliance on SA for their oil. The US is once again in control of its own destiny.
7461 2018-11-10 22:31:04 No wonder so many people died. I wouldn't want to be waterboarded with tea tree oil either lol.
7462 2018-11-10 22:31:02 Alberto , esa gorra tuya , tiene como 2 años ... y en el entre tiempo el oil toco los 79$ ...

7465 2018-11-10 22:30:45 Oil companies can regain their morality by investing in nuclear research and power in plants
7466 2018-11-10 22:30:29 I mean you gotta admit it’s a bit intense... and it’s a commercial for a brand to promote their own products, and slander their competitors for using palm oil. I think y’all got tricked into making this viral. Just saying.
7467 2018-11-10 22:30:02 Je ne comprends pas quelle est la question. Nous parlons bc du vélo élec et de son potentiel
7468 2018-11-10 22:29:56 Oh yes he looks so squeakylicious! A friend had a good kale recipe: blanch blanch blanch. Meanwhile, warm chilli + garlic in oil. Toss toss; some toasted chopped hazelnuts; squish lemon; salt.
7469 2018-11-10 22:29:45 In theory mineral oil is not bioavailable, which is why it is often used as placebo, but dose here was high
7470 2018-11-10 22:29:39 We love your advert & your standing up for what’s right in this evil industry. Keep up the good work & the public will support you by banning those companies that blatantly ignore the use of palm oil & instead shop at at Iceland! Well done 
7471 2018-11-10 22:29:29 Ceremonial pomp maybe, but successful operations? They failed in Iraq, they failed in Afghanistan. The pomp masks the death for oil/opioids & ineffectiveness of the wars. The Taliban reversed everything so easily after they left Afghanistan. Military egos prefer to ignore it.
7472 2018-11-10 22:29:24 The magical (D) is the greatest get-out-of-jail card, ever.
7473 2018-11-10 22:29:18 When the oil supply does indeed decrease then the market will create alternative energy solutions. The “worst experiment in history” is increasing the price for energy in order to stop a global disaster that doesn’t exist. More than that, it’s downright stupid.
7474 2018-11-10 22:29:12 They should be so lucky. Dinosaurs were the enduring, highly adaptable champions of an Earth era. Do you really mean to compliment oil execs like this?
7475 2018-11-10 22:29:12 Ad was made by Greenpeace, Iceland made an agreement with them to use it, and to end palm oil use in their products. Clearcast who greenlight ads for TV, wouldn't allow it, they believe it contravenes ASA rules on political advertising.
7476 2018-11-10 22:28:58 really hope my cheap oil ps gauge is just stupid because that shit is reading 0 at idle lol

7478 2018-11-10 22:28:47 I’ve had the most ‘dad’ day today. I helped Alyssa put air in her tires and checked her oil for her, took a nap in the chair, AND I’m going to a basketball game tonight. Such a great life 
7479 2018-11-10 22:28:33 Dinosaurs? Coal & oil come from fossilised vegetation, surely? Totally vegan fuel.
7480 2018-11-10 22:28:22 The whole Black Jamaican castor oil line from Shea Moistures is the truth
7481 2018-11-10 22:28:17 Why do you have to brand oil money in a derogatory & illegal term? Is it their fault some filthy rich Arabs wanted to invest in them? Give it a rest. As for the corruption side of things, there’s governing bodies who should be regulating that, again, let’s just worry about us.
7482 2018-11-10 22:27:51 Instead of taking medicine for my jaw problems I just rub a bunch of peppermint oil on my face and now my eyes are burning and I'm so cold 
7483 2018-11-10 22:27:48 Iv always felt that since everything in life is connected, that earth is an atom that’s body is the universe. If that makes since then just like you wouldn’t try and take the mitochondria out an Atom. Then why take oil out of earth and replace it with sand and mud?
7484 2018-11-10 22:27:45 Oil is money again.  Never wasn’t.

7487 2018-11-10 22:27:31 Forget not the extra-virgin olive oil!!!
7488 2018-11-10 22:27:08 Just take your time. Don't rush it and you'll be fine. If you can change the oil in your car/bike you can build a PC
7489 2018-11-10 22:27:06 like......... why the actual hell would you ONLY put olive oil on something???? that sounds awful
7490 2018-11-10 22:27:05 Well done Iceland. The rest of you Tesco Sainsbury's Coop et al I won't buy anything with palm oil in. Simples.
7491 2018-11-10 22:27:03 Amazing if your country holds the majority of the worlds oil , you can clearly get away with murder #Saudi_Arabia

7495 2018-11-10 22:26:38 Hei @elonmusk The official Norwegian (government owned) oil company, Statoil, changed their name to Equinor to focus on all energy not just “old dinosaurs” Changes are coming 
7496 2018-11-10 22:26:31 I am pretty sure your familiar with this part of the supply curve that says, the higher the supply the lower the price. Prior to this govt we had ample supply of forex (oil boom) but this govt bereft of ideas has done nothing to increase forex supply, hence we at 365 per $
7497 2018-11-10 22:26:29 My brother is gonna teach me how to change my own oil and change a tire and I’m honestly so excited to actually know how to do something about Abel lol 
7498 2018-11-10 22:26:20 Most of us know about Palm oil and what the removal of trees is doing to the animals habitat. Something similar is happening to parts of the Amazon. These companies have no respect for the eco system but their future heirs will curse them.
7499 2018-11-10 22:26:09 What's political about that!
They mean it harms ECONOMIC interests
of EXPLOITATIVE COMPANIES who don't give a f*ck coz they don't have to count the cost of deforestation/extinction on balance sheet. 
Companies don't count the cost but orangutans do!
DON'T BUY PALM OIL PRODUCTS
7500 2018-11-10 22:26:08 If there were only two things I really believe I need as supplements for my overall health, they are lots of Vitamin D and Magnesium Oil.
7501 2018-11-10 22:25:57 @SA6175 Yes, FDA approved mineral oil.  But now doctors see the data and will be a lot of discussions. Also MOA did not check out.
7502 2018-11-10 22:25:54 @SARSteinbach  its going to cost me about 1400$ to fix the oil leak on the motor- leason learned, always investigate before u buy used -honesty is priceless

7504 2018-11-10 22:25:53 Put yourself in their shoes then we can understand why legacy auto & big oil are behaving the way they are. To affect change, do: 1) find ways to vote politicians out of office, 2) kill ICE w/even cheaper EV, sub $25k NOW, 3) Obtain $ from super wealthy, speed up Model Y GF NOW.

7507 2018-11-10 22:25:20 I just saw a mohsen oil tanker truck on a 10 Freeway westbound outside of shaky town by 75 miles that mohsen oil company is shipping oil from Dubai
7508 2018-11-10 22:25:20 Do you...do you think oil prices are dictated by the minimum wage in America?
7509 2018-11-10 22:25:07 So docs are going to tell patients, “well, there is a drug that can cut your chance of a heart attack by 25%, but due to mineral oil, I will not prescribe. Sorry.”
7510 2018-11-10 22:24:34 how do you deal with big oil? you just adopt and adapt.
7511 2018-11-10 22:24:31 This is great for private business to capitalize on a growing demand. If electric vehicles were the most economic and viable choice tomorrow there would still be people driving gas vehicles for 20 years. Even If demand for oil falls, low supply maintains or increases the price.
7512 2018-11-10 22:24:18 They couldn't defend him so they were now like even Fashola deported their people , then I told them to oppose Fashola when the time comes.
7513 2018-11-10 22:24:09 #IcelandChristmasAdvert  Bravo Iceland for doing the right thing. The food industry must stop hiding the grim reality of unsustainably sourced foods.  We have the power - we can choose NOT to buy palm oil products, or we do nothing and lose this species - extinction is forever.
7514 2018-11-10 22:24:03 do any of y’all use cbd oil or any cbd products for anxiety I’ve been wanting to try it so I’m curious if it works for you guys
7515 2018-11-10 22:24:02 Actually @youthvgov has discovered that the oil companies scientists, through their own scientific investigation and documents, discovered that the oil industries practices perpetrate climate change and covered up by organized criminal cabal of govt employees corporate execs
7516 2018-11-10 22:23:56 I know oil spills are devastating to ecosystems like the Eventwater Horizon disaster in 2006, deforestation I’m not so sure on. And burning fossil fuels is usually frowned upon, but so many people rely on them that it’ll be so costly to replace them with other renewable sources.
7517 2018-11-10 22:23:54 Gua blm checkout malem ini. Kmaren doang bio oil

7519 2018-11-10 22:23:30 Sane people don't commit mass murder, civilians don't need automatic weapons. Mentally ill veterans wouldn't exist if you're industrial/military/congressional complex didn't send young people to foreign countries to murder innocent people for oil, and then neglect them on return.

We will keep dogging his bigotry one mess at a time?
7529 2018-11-10 22:22:35 lol that’s how some Nigerians pronounce ‘oil’
7530 2018-11-10 22:22:30 Why have people been misled about Palm Oil?
We never had it b4, we did not miss it
It only goes in cakes etc that are not ESSENTIAL+often unhealthy

Hello Planet Orangutan
7531 2018-11-10 22:22:30 I remember you sending me that! And aqua marina, but I think that one threw my skin out of balance. It smelled sooooo gorgeous omfg i was so upset that it would break me out. Like BAD bad def remember to be sparing w the oil! That one sounds like it could work good, luv roses
7532 2018-11-10 22:22:21 Hello @IcelandFoods You're officially my favourite grocery shop after seeing this. 

Where can I find out more info on your palm oil project?
7533 2018-11-10 22:22:08 As a Brit, I find it unfathomable that you allow this clown to "manage" your country. You allow the ownership of automatic weapons - whose only puepose is mass death.  You invade foreign countries for their oil; pretend that global warming is a myth; and act like world rulers
7534 2018-11-10 22:21:46 Le gas oil de la Cadillac de @realDonaldTrump ne doit pas être assez taxé!

7536 2018-11-10 22:21:36 One time I was asked by a patient's relative if it was possible to inject/ infuse anointing oil. 
 Sounded somehow, but  then I thought,  these people have gone through so much anything would make sense to them.
7537 2018-11-10 22:21:17 Pretty sure it’s tea tree oil straight to the trachea and pumpkin seed oil in the eyes

7542 2018-11-10 22:21:06 Let’s see, a drug company sponsored fish oil drug study is not statistically significantly, yet shows great promise. Should we expect a pep rally?
7543 2018-11-10 22:21:03 Corals and bees are already dying, while oil industry is still giddy with new discoveries, new coal and oil palm concessions are still granted like there's no tomorrow, and methane-rich permafrost is melting as we speak.
7544 2018-11-10 22:21:00 Being stupid is lazy work, and believing oil companies is more convenient. Hence why low intelligence people tend to gravitate towards the more convenient answers despite having all the facts and evidence proves otherwise.
7545 2018-11-10 22:20:57 Great effort to downplay and really amazing response time to interview so many people in the matter of miliseconds. But you’ll need something better than the mineral oil “caveat” that was debunked long ago. Even if it did the results would still be stat sig..

7554 2018-11-10 22:20:03 what about mineral oil would "wash out" statins?

7556 2018-11-10 22:19:53 $AMRN all this mineral oil placebo effect is nothing but pure BS to grab some attention to their articles. ~25% RRR is unprecedented in CV space on top of statins.

7566 2018-11-10 22:18:56 I've been using a durag and a stocking cap... Coconut oil and a little cantu... It's helping.
7567 2018-11-10 22:18:28 and in addition to all the other negative oil data, people started talking about break evens
7568 2018-11-10 22:18:25 You need to see how they came fr me yesterday cos I reminded them of a tip of an iceberg of the atrocities of their ethnic bigot Son Peter Obi
7569 2018-11-10 22:18:22 If not one penny of her or her husbands went into the Trumps pockets, then it would seem completely legit and honorable. Otherwise, it’s the oil greasing the wheels.
7570 2018-11-10 22:18:09 Rear end gear prob. He tried to race it, but after going green, it is putting oil on right rear. He is wrecking loose, so parking it to not wreck. We are done, unfortunately. // PR @SmithbiltHomes @MBMMotorsports @XfinityRacing @ISMRaceway #TeamFinchum
7571 2018-11-10 22:18:01 He sounded normal. Drives a regular truck. Talked about how he didn't really ever think he'd get into racing, he and his dad never talked racing. He grew up filling up oil for people as a job. Also talked about how crashing F'd up his head, gets into what concussions did to him
7572 2018-11-10 22:17:54 You can find this at the Asian markets almost anywhere. I don’t add the oil packet but add ALL THE CHILI
7573 2018-11-10 22:17:48 Yes, I'm aware. That's why I said what I said.
7574 2018-11-10 22:17:46 Dill havarti and rosemary and olive oil Triscuits are my go-to easy supper.
7575 2018-11-10 22:17:39 My cartridge broke in my pocket last night and I lost like half a gram of oil 
7576 2018-11-10 22:17:32 Goreham is a darling of the Heartland Institute and several other nonsensical non-expert noisemaking bodies who front for oil and other interested parties. The man is a buffoon and not to be referenced unless in jest.

7578 2018-11-10 22:17:31 Check out my blog post on the benefits of coconut oil muffins made with cassava flour! Link in bio.
7579 2018-11-10 22:17:31 And they use palm oil in their products.
7580 2018-11-10 22:17:31 Apart from raising awareness and not purchasing palm oil, what else can we do to help?
7581 2018-11-10 22:17:25 You  just defined science. We keep working and arguing every bit of data until all possibilities are exhausted. It is called peer review. Not many wrong ideas or even theories last long. 
This one started in the 70s and 80s with the oil companies fronting it. Still holding.
7582 2018-11-10 22:17:25 I got you! I still got the oil too lol
7583 2018-11-10 22:17:11 If the rumours are true and the Saudi's collapse oil prices' then UK fracking is going to become an expensive folly.
7584 2018-11-10 22:17:06 $amrn what happened to the bots?  Waiting for Wall Street to weigh in now. We will see what they have to say. I think the mace5 and mace3 being so strong caught everyone off guard.  Who would have thought we would debate mineral oil. Experts seem to think negligible.

7588 2018-11-10 22:16:53 Hey Genius. Trump is allowing Russia to take over Syria as the next step in controlling the Middle Eastern oil. Control Syria, control any overland pipelines to the Mediterranean. I bet you won't be talking about that.
7589 2018-11-10 22:16:52 I might have to go to the dang health food store to by lip balm cause everyone apparently uses soybean oil and my lips react to that now I hate this
7590 2018-11-10 22:16:49 Was London looking for a way to smash German power in 1914, especially since the Berlin-Baghdad railway was near competition and threatened Britain's hegemony over oil producing regions.
1914/1939, Br declared war in Germany; 1919/1945, Br blamed it all on Germany.
7591 2018-11-10 22:16:48 ..luego el siguiente CD de MIDNIGHT OIL fue BLUE SKY MINING (cuya portada es una TORMENTA ELECTRICA en un DESIERTO) y cuyo 1er single fue BLUE SKY MINE dedicado a la ciudad de WITTENOOM (Australia) q fue abandonada x la contaminación de una MINA y donde casualmente nació..

7594 2018-11-10 22:16:41 Norway is lucky enough to have enough money. Smart enough to save up oil income. For generations.
7595 2018-11-10 22:16:35 @VascepaBID There is no other explanation to the data.  Mineral oil by itself inert, it should not poison ppl like that.
7596 2018-11-10 22:16:33 I haven't eaten in a day and all I crave is sushi but I'm so hungover and don't have my oil pen and will probably just make myself throw up 
7597 2018-11-10 22:16:29 Yummy! Apparently the oil had wood shavings in lol
7598 2018-11-10 22:16:28 I'm not even sure if its possible to reduce palm oil use within our lifestyle choices, it is used extensively in so many products not just the obvious one

7601 2018-11-10 22:16:06 I had no idea.  I just started using palm oil because it’s one of the very few oils I don’t have a negative reaction to. . Guess I’ll have to find another one....
7602 2018-11-10 22:15:48 Oil. 
I ain't got room to talk. I'm oil too.
7603 2018-11-10 22:15:46 Been listening to radio show podcasts that talk about the postal strike & the crown corporation- they’re mostly right wing. The same people who prop up the oil industry & resist renewables rail on & on about how the postal service is a dinosaur that needs to be put down
7604 2018-11-10 22:15:42 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

7610 2018-11-10 22:14:58 The only funny thing I could think of when watching this was did she go into the kitchen and use her mom’s good olive oil to oil up her arms and stomach
7611 2018-11-10 22:14:46 Oil, sorry Bro. It stinks-you will sort it if yo haven’t already!!
7612 2018-11-10 22:14:38 Da iawn Nigel. I agree that their action against the use of palm oil is a good one but dismayed that they're so anti-Welsh and as such will never shop there until that is rectified.
7613 2018-11-10 22:14:29 Everyone follow @Oil_Guns_Merica.  He's smart and oh-so-HAWT. Muscles galore.  Hottie.  Conservative #PleaseHugMeUntilIDie #KillMeWithIt #SmartAndHot #WeKnowYoureShowingOff
7614 2018-11-10 22:14:29 The not so good news is that my car has a small oil leak... the good news is it apparently is so small that they couldn’t find it and didn’t charge me since they couldn’t find it
7615 2018-11-10 22:14:26 Oil + water =

7616 2018-11-10 22:14:20 For RU, strength in the USD helps to off-set price weakness on oil. Unless oil drops significantly more than the ruble, as is the current situation. RU likely wants around 75 Brent. Not hot enough to spike ruble, not too low to hurt oil revenues.
7617 2018-11-10 22:14:13 Ya hey to the fucking bitches who came last minute to my shop for an oil change but with 4 fucking trucks which one only need an oil change and thr rest needed so much more and made me stay 4 hrs more at work 
Fuck you
7618 2018-11-10 22:14:06 "Only country to discover oil and have food banks" - what? Norway and other Nordic nations have around 3,000,000 food bank meals served every year. The US has plenty of oil and plenty of food banks...

Also, "60bn taken 28bn given back" is absolute nonsense.
7619 2018-11-10 22:14:04 I didn't do anything wrong. Google maps led me into a closed road, didn't see the rock, I accidentally hit it and my oil started leaking. Fuck.
7620 2018-11-10 22:14:01 Look into the region in which specific finds are found, then compare that depth to the average depth of oil wells in that specific region.
7621 2018-11-10 22:13:57 And thus, the depth of oil wells is no evidence for the biotic or a biotic status of the source of fossils fuels.

7630 2018-11-10 22:12:35 $AMRN Mineral oil washed out statins.  It was a trial of statins (V arm) vs inactivated statins (placebo arm).  They proved  statins work
7631 2018-11-10 22:12:34 I’m sorry but palm oil is the evil. Take a look at Iceland at least they give a dam anout the palm oil devastation
7632 2018-11-10 22:12:26 Fun fact, dawn dish soap can help get rid of the oil. But you still have to vacuum up the soap.

7638 2018-11-10 22:11:15 Otherwise agree but AFAIK oil is mainly dead algae and plankton, not the screwed-up first attempt of intelligent life (who needs a neocortex to keep balance when you have a tail).
7639 2018-11-10 22:11:14 For ice cream? Hot fudge. For waffles? Maple syrup. For Falafel? Tahini. For eggs? Tabasco. For sushi? Soy. For Baked potato? Sour Cream. For everything else Olive oil.
7640 2018-11-10 22:11:00 5. Coconut oil paste

First, heat one cup of coconut oil until it turns to liquid. Then add two teaspoons of baking soda and 5-10 drops of natural spearmint essential oil into this liquid and mix.
7641 2018-11-10 22:10:36 Did you hear about the people of Fort Mckay? The oil sands industry in ALberta saved them from poverty. This project could have the same effect on so many communities.
7642 2018-11-10 22:10:33 Two people — 46 percent. Number six, we are bombing the oil. And always so theatrical; Mr. American Flag.
7643 2018-11-10 22:10:30 This pipeline will have substantial economic benefits. It will triple oil products being produced in Canada, providing more employment within the sector and overflowing income into other industries.
7644 2018-11-10 22:10:15 Looks like the WCS pricing is heading towards negative pricing as WTI heads towards 20 and the discount keeps widening. Producers will need to pay refiners to accept their oil out of the congested pipeline.
7645 2018-11-10 22:10:09 crazy how the tables turn lmaooo, i jus got my mom to hit the oil pen one time for the one time
7646 2018-11-10 22:10:03 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
7647 2018-11-10 22:09:59 So, you are openly admitting that it cannot be proven. Destroy the economy and Canadian families on a theory....that, is complete bullshit. Keep importing oil from other countries but kill our own economy - for zero beneft...that is why the Conservatives will win in a landslide.
7648 2018-11-10 22:09:53 lewd, rude, and malicious pride of never going to my casino? thats the house of sin son, youre not welcome in church. not getting more and more kind, courteous, nor polite; off those kind, courteous and polite! well enough not swine; grain dust in my uncles beard; oil on his kids

7650 2018-11-10 22:09:42 Not at all. I'm missing a nose, but I'm told the my new full-body herb wrap with olive oil makes me smell like pizza. I find that quite funny.
7651 2018-11-10 22:09:40 In this study, results might be falsely significant due to negative effect of mineral oil given to placebo group. Interpret with caution. See a few of my RTs about this.

7653 2018-11-10 22:09:15 We need to do everything at once, because Oil kept action delayed for decades.
7654 2018-11-10 22:09:09 The eff has a "stupid patent of the month" article on their site. Maybe you could make a "security snake oil of the week"
7655 2018-11-10 22:09:09 Do you think we will be able to save oil companies mistakes before the damage becomes completely unrepairable?
7656 2018-11-10 22:09:01 I agree with you. It’s a shame it’s taken an Iceland PR stunt to highlight an ad greenpeace made & was banned for them 3 months ago. We should all check labels going forward especially those who will now shop at Iceland, as they still sell brand products with palm oil in. 
7657 2018-11-10 22:08:59 ikr i cant believe it takes 3 to 5 business days for oil to arrive to korea

7665 2018-11-10 22:07:58 Yep!
85-8% of Brazil soy goes to livestock feed, with 7% going to human food, and the remainder going to biofuels and oil.
The facts just don’t support laying the blame on vegans
Besides, most ethical vegans buy ethically sourced and fair trade when available... or go without...
7666 2018-11-10 22:07:56 Why they (oil Giants) never thought of doing this before?!?! The basic technology was already in available... Someone must push the boundaries.
7667 2018-11-10 22:07:55 lets just use the fkin oil to save me from haulin wood? Nah im on hydro for my winter heat. Very reliable and I have a backup wood heater with more wood than I can shake my stick at.
7668 2018-11-10 22:07:54 @Oil_Guns_Merica OMG, you're simply determined to hot us all out. Keep being a tease. It makes me turgid.
7669 2018-11-10 22:07:54 The only ones who doesn’t see that is the ones who are in a certainly way attached to the oil industry or dumb ones who doesn’t see that one plus one is two.
7670 2018-11-10 22:07:51 To the Orangutan’s this is like the war of the worlds can you imagine an alien (human bulldozers) wreaking havoc on our homes and killing us that’s exactly what they are going through systematically every day it’s heartbreaking and unnecessary say NO to palm oil now!

7672 2018-11-10 22:07:32 Yes, it's to move Canadian oil to the gulf for export to foreign markets.
7673 2018-11-10 22:07:26 Very sad to watch all the tributes by the British legion when the last few wars were all about oil and power and regime change. May all those who gave their lives rest in peace now .
7674 2018-11-10 22:07:23 Also CRP decreased in the fish oil group
7675 2018-11-10 22:07:16 Actually it won't. Because of @realDonaldTrump, the U.S. oil and natural gas production makes American Energy independent. Without Canadian or Mexico's Oil. What's needed is more U.S. Refineries to reduce the prices at pumps, when operational they operate at 98 percent capacity
7676 2018-11-10 22:07:16 Sprinkle them around the base of acid loving plants such as holly or rhododendron.  If you don’t have a garden then mix with a little coconut, almond or avocado oil for an exfoliating scrub.  It scares me to realize how much I think about coffee grounds.

7681 2018-11-10 22:06:34 Everyone out here worrying about (and ensuring exposure of) an ad about palm oil and I’m just wondering where the emphasis on action comes into this #playingtheneoliberalgame
7682 2018-11-10 22:06:33 You should be able to remove everything with a spoon. Take a way the seeds and keep them (in a pan with a tea spoon of oil are delicious!! )
Put some butter or olive oil inside the  pumpkin and your done.

burning oil isn't a good idea for 
the hundredth out~of~control~
fire time.
7684 2018-11-10 22:06:19 Statins are not the only thing mineral oil prevents absorption of, which is why it shouldn't be consumed.
7685 2018-11-10 22:06:14 Ringt, burning oil is stupid, but ... to save Earth you have to fly the billions of new kids to Mars ... and soon.
7686 2018-11-10 22:06:14 Answer seems clear.   Avoid mineral oil.   :)
7687 2018-11-10 22:06:07 With so much oil in Venezuela, why can't it come out of inflation? It lacks the support of USD in its currency much like Saudi/KSA have.

7689 2018-11-10 22:05:24 Well actually in terms of euro and dollars most commodities including crude oil, gold etc were actually cheaper in 2016 compared to 2007. That is usually what happens when most economies around the world aren't doing very well.

7694 2018-11-10 22:04:37 Just greed & selfishness Michelle, fear & ignorance.Met a few on holiday last week when I explained some things, they had no answers. Circa £60b taken, £28b returned in a “grant”, the only country to discover oil & end up with foodbanks. None of it makes sense. #DissolveTheUnion
7695 2018-11-10 22:04:36 feel free to take all the refugees from the wars you start so you get access to oil and resources whilst you're at it
7696 2018-11-10 22:04:29 Do you remember that meeting he had with SA? He let them know that he wasn't going to put up with their manipulation of oil prices and human rights abuse. Hardly a supporter of the regime.
7697 2018-11-10 22:04:12 also coffee with coconut oil is

7700 2018-11-10 22:03:41 I hate going to get oil changes
7701 2018-11-10 22:03:40 Crude Oil Prices May Extend Fall as Fed Boosts USD, Sinks S&P 500
7702 2018-11-10 22:03:27 Got my key fixed, went grocery shopping only thing left is this oil change and that can wait until Tuesday
7703 2018-11-10 22:03:24 You know what? Fairplay play to them for milking tourists for all their worth. That oil money isn’t going to last forever. Some people want to live in a theme park.
7704 2018-11-10 22:03:19 There will be deadly food shortages. Oil, natural gas, and gasoline supply systems will fail and there will be energy shortages. You won't be able to use your computer or cell phone. The internet and existing roads and infrastructure will collapse.

How will we resolve this?

7706 2018-11-10 22:03:11 fucks sake...just lookin at my cupboard 1) biscuits for cheese 2) microwaveable popcorn 3) aldi salted caramel mince pies. all contain palm oil...this will be harder than i thought.
7707 2018-11-10 22:03:11 Hi, our delicious bars do not contain palm oil.
7708 2018-11-10 22:03:07 Did I read that China owns a lot of the property now on fire?   Wish I could go back and find that link.   Must research this I guess.    Hmmm
7709 2018-11-10 22:02:45 Since when has the oil industry ever said that we’ll never run out of hydrocarbon? Obviously we will. Agreed we need to move to electric vehicles, but how do we generate all that additional electricity? Please don’t say windmills!
7710 2018-11-10 22:02:36 aaaaah! é oil cleansing?? eu e meu namorado testamos por um tempo, cerca de 2 meses! tentei com óleo de coco, mas não me dei muito bem com o método. na real eu queria uma dermatologista com essa pegada mais alternativa, mas não encontrei por aqui.

7715 2018-11-10 22:02:10 Plus oil from plants and dinasours is not 100% proven! Hidrocarbons have been discover on other places in the Solar System. Some people go as far as saying crude oil is renewable!
7716 2018-11-10 22:02:03 Self made is the best. With good olive oil. Maybe some garlic and a bit of Dijon.
7717 2018-11-10 22:01:51 The legacy car manufacturers have invested in the oil operated engine. It’s difficult for them take the punches of change and monetary loss. It’s a crack addiction that has to be cut by disruptors like Tesla.
7718 2018-11-10 22:01:50 tea tree oil smell sooo  good!
7719 2018-11-10 22:01:46 It’s the asphalt made of oil products burning not the steel.  Why can’t “journalists” have some scientific training
7720 2018-11-10 22:01:43 Agree. I want to say so much more but I won't.
7721 2018-11-10 22:01:40 More forests are chopped down for the meat industry than palm oil. And more oceans are depleted of life. What do Iceland sell lots of? The advert should be banned for its hypocrisy.
7722 2018-11-10 22:01:34 Can u buy all that oil companies and diversify them into clean energy production? New challenge to you ))
7723 2018-11-10 22:01:31 dear friends in cos who are worried their car is gonna explode but don't have money to get an oil change: pls come over to alekx's auto shop (aka my dad's garage) where i will service ya
7724 2018-11-10 22:01:28 So I use coconut oil instead of lotion, but its fucking cold right now and Coconut oil solidifies when cold, so I turned on Fortnite and put the bottle behind my ps4 because Fortnite gets hot and makes my ps4 fans work the hardest

7726 2018-11-10 22:01:13 Taking care of my skin at night with the oil cleansing method - so much better then the normal makeup removal. Highly recommended if you haven’t tried it ladies.. #beautytips
7727 2018-11-10 22:01:08 have to have balls before they can be smashed.  yelling a little girl mean you got no nutz
7728 2018-11-10 22:01:05 We would really rather mine what little oil is left in the world and destroy it even quicker, just because we’re greedy and stupid.
7729 2018-11-10 22:01:00 Maybe they’re cólicos, when my baby gets like that I rub baby oil on her tummy and she knocks out , también if I just lay her on my stomach she stops crying . Maybe this could help if you haven’t tried
7730 2018-11-10 22:00:59 I need to get an oil change. N I get off at 7 n work 10 am tomorrowhow imma do this.
7731 2018-11-10 22:00:55 I expect humanity to be as dead as the dinosaurs before the last dinosaur has been burnt just because climate will go wild before the last drop of oil is squeezed out of the soil by fracking etc. But living in a country not having oil I have to think about alternatives anyway.
7732 2018-11-10 22:00:52 About to try CBD oil
7733 2018-11-10 22:00:45 Do not, I repeat, do not seek out the banned Iceland palm oil advert. Or even contemplate watching Lilo & Stitch.

7737 2018-11-10 22:00:22 I said I ate a lot of puff puff a while ago, after eating there was oil all over my hand and tissue in front of me. I used the back of my hand to shift the tissue to one side and i rubbed my hand thoroughly on my head. I respect our culture.
7738 2018-11-10 22:00:18 @BettyCrocker Why did you change the gluten-free formulas? They are now all grainy and clumpy, but they were perfect before. Adding canola oil (gross and inflammatory) and cornstarch (a lot of people are allergic) has ruined your beautiful gluten-free yellow cake mix. #glutenfree
7739 2018-11-10 22:00:17 Oil companies have stopped the lie, it is now just the entrenched politicians....
7740 2018-11-10 22:00:15 We have a dog who comes in about once a month for boarding who’s name is Josey and she takes fish oil at every meal and her fish oil pills are shaped liked real fish and it’s So Cute
7741 2018-11-10 22:00:11 When we run out of dead dinasaur we will use dead star materials.  Or worse find an algae that can make synthetic gas or oil.  I wish we would utilise solar too.  All that sunlight going to waste on roofs.
7742 2018-11-10 22:00:09 So what I’m hearing is that some evil cabal of Oil Barons are preventing the development of other energy systems ?
7743 2018-11-10 22:00:08 November 10, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
7744 2018-11-10 22:00:04 btw i finally managed to get vanilla scented oil so my room smells like vanilla now and i am: very happy
7745 2018-11-10 22:00:03 This option then you're an oil/moisture cat…
7746 2018-11-10 21:59:57 At least in part.  Ok, now the truth is that the planet isn't going to transition away from wood, coal, gas & oil in 10 years. It won't happen in 20 years, or 50, or 75.  Common sense & history shows it will take 100-200 years to get it done and then only when green is profitable
7747 2018-11-10 21:59:55 Told my dad if he bought oil and a filter for my car I’d change his oil also! Guess who just got herself a free oil change!

7749 2018-11-10 21:59:49 The pacing & format of this #X018 is a wild, wild mess. Slow interviews, awkward host segments, and a crowd who seems to have been fed an oil tankard full of Mountain Dew.
7750 2018-11-10 21:59:45 Apple cider vinegar is the new coconut oil
7751 2018-11-10 21:59:15 So you’re stating that fossils from this period are found at 2-3 miles below the earths crust? Or even further? You should really look into the average depths in certain regions and compare such to the average depth of the oil wells in such regions.
7752 2018-11-10 21:59:07 I hear they're trying to clone woolly mammoths so oil is on the way! (sarcasm)
7753 2018-11-10 21:59:07 What about the Wayne National Forest? Ohio’s only national forest being leased for oil and gas.
7754 2018-11-10 21:59:01 The Keystone pipeline would carry bituman tar sand crude oil (very thick and harder to clean...it's called tar sands for a reason). The other oil is crude oil but is much lighter in comparison and much easier to clean.
7755 2018-11-10 21:59:01 That seal reads "president of the federal republic of entertainment" not Nigeria 
7756 2018-11-10 21:58:58 Campaigning against palm oil is not party political
7757 2018-11-10 21:58:58 Besides cutting Nat'l parks budget #45  ordered Ryan Zinke to offer 12 million acres of land at 27 national monuments/parks for sale, auction, and lease to oil and gas companies. Not his land to sell for profit. America is for sale!

I learned this from a woman who has been a middle-school cook for 25 yrs now:
Got roaches in the kitchen?
Pour bleach down the drains, add it to bottom of dishwasher & run it wo dishes.
Soak cotton balls w Peppermint Oil (not flavoring) & put em under sink etc.
7760 2018-11-10 21:58:54 Elon do you really truly believe oil comes from dinosaurs? I think it’s actually a replenishable inexhaustible Sores naturally developed by the earth
7761 2018-11-10 21:58:54 oil dey your head......of course I know na, just wan fight trouble as usual
7762 2018-11-10 21:58:41 @HotelChocolat is palm oil free!
7763 2018-11-10 21:58:28 Would never have been approved. Iceland and Greenpeace knew this. Btw Iceland not banned other people's brands with Palm oil. Still sell them and make a profit. Political adverts can't be allowed. That's the law otherwise rich people cab influence politics. #AaronBanks.
7764 2018-11-10 21:58:19 Here’s my understanding from watching it happen: before the oil price crash of 1998, there was a general feeling that things were going to be fine. They moved all the excess earning into the principle. The price crash emptied the CBR, and signaled an underlying problem.
7765 2018-11-10 21:58:06 That’s amazing. I wish we’d stop using palm oil in the US as well. Or at least limit it.
7766 2018-11-10 21:57:57 @elonmusk for myself the big oil companies don't care about the future they are same as the companies of the 19th century they just want profit more than more and don't think about the new generation who will come after them
7767 2018-11-10 21:57:57 I only use natural oils. Rosehip, Tea tree, lemon, and Aesop’s fabulous face oil
7768 2018-11-10 21:57:57 The hawks of war are monstrous individuals in government who debilitate reason and don’t even ask why we should be conducting proxy wars in the first place. The U.S./Saudi/Yemen disaster is looking up to be another oil war for industry. We’ve been there before in Iraq. Not again.
7769 2018-11-10 21:57:56 Yeah, that sounds about right. You don't have to let that one go
7770 2018-11-10 21:57:55 Probably a thousand reasons why it can’t be done,but a rail line was built through the mountains,almost by hand.With oil tankers being built like ice breakers, why can’t a pipeline be built from Hardisty  AB to Churchill MB. Beats Western separation, which is fine with me .IMO.
7771 2018-11-10 21:57:55 Because the few that profit BIG from palm oil paid a lot of money to get it removed. Obviously it backfired big time because finally the masses are kicking off about it etc.
7772 2018-11-10 21:57:50 I’ve spent all day mixing colors to perfect my oil palette. I’ve skipped the most basic steps in my journey, now it’s time to rewind before I die of fear and paralyzation.
7773 2018-11-10 21:57:41 ..y después d actuar @inxs en concierto STOP THE DROP en Sydney MYER Music BOWL d MELBOURNE (1983) actuó MIDNIGHT OIL cantando 4 canciones como SHORT MEMORY y  U.S. FORCES d su nuevo LP "10,9,8,7,6,5,4,2,1" y luego publicaron VELAS ROJAS EN EL ATARDECER con una portada d SIDNEY..
7774 2018-11-10 21:57:38 That’s what I got (plus a few smaller things). The babyfacial, vitamin c serum, & the facial oil 
7775 2018-11-10 21:57:36 We are dependent on oil for a very long time yet. Alberta has some of the best environmental protections in place but we cant get our oil out and import Saudi oil instead. Which is not earth friendly! 

How's those lithium strip mines?
7776 2018-11-10 21:57:33 How much palm oil.
7777 2018-11-10 21:57:32 @teacakeandmake I was wondering if you are going to send the Utama Spice Nebulizing Essential Oil Diffuser that I won via your blog? I have emailed again & again since we last spoke but haven't had a reply. 
7778 2018-11-10 21:57:23 Ill never forget the time I made my own whipped Shea butter and added my own scent (a Muslim oil) and my dad told me it smelled like a black n mild 
7779 2018-11-10 21:57:23 We have to stop meekly asking those in power to give up their thrones of oil and blood. It's time for a #climaterevolt.
7780 2018-11-10 21:57:13 Nothing like going to get an oil change and they say “everything looks good”
7781 2018-11-10 21:57:10 what in the fuck is a splash of oil? i need precise measurments man like im not a chef
7782 2018-11-10 21:57:09 3. No longer "British"...Somalia, South  Africa, Sri Lanka - deep breath  - Sudan,  Swaziland, Tanzania, Tonga,  Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu,  Uganda,  United Arab Emirates, United  States, Vanuatu, Yemen, Zambia and   Zimbabwe. Phew! But not YOU  Scotland! You have OIL
7783 2018-11-10 21:56:57 I wish everyone could see it and stop buying products that contain palm oil. 
7784 2018-11-10 21:56:49 On a separate aside/geographical point I do question whether banning palm oil altogether is the right approach (due to its widespread use and the employment dependent on it)- but that is actually Iceland's approach not Greenpeace.
7785 2018-11-10 21:56:41 I chose canola since I’m allergic to olives and therefore olive oil. I prefer the taste though.
7786 2018-11-10 21:56:36 And for 25mb, that's your mother's brain memory size
7787 2018-11-10 21:56:35 Like I won’t be there Sunday pointing to my phone. See what this says. Looks to me that my oil change is free 
7788 2018-11-10 21:56:28 My sister works in Oil and wants out. What would you suggest an environmental engineer that’s been working w/ EPA regs for oil companies do to get out? What kinds of jobs are there to transition away from Oil?
7789 2018-11-10 21:56:25 The oil is a good deal but I could eat the entire containers of the pretzel products in one sitting

7795 2018-11-10 21:55:38 L'oreal for men beard oil. My face smells godlike.
7796 2018-11-10 21:55:38 I ate a lot of puff puff a while ago, after eating there was oil all over my hand and tissue in front of me. I used the back of my hand to shift the tissue to one side and i rubbed my hand thoroughly on my head. I respect our culture.
7797 2018-11-10 21:55:33 Well done Iceland Foods for having some guts an telling it like it is. The food industry must stop hiding the grim & cruel reality of unsustainably sourced foods. C'mon ppl gain the power & choose NOT to buy palm oil produce. sign Petition on change .org & support the ad

7800 2018-11-10 21:55:03 got my baby an oil change yesterday and wash and clean today I been neglecting her
7801 2018-11-10 21:55:00 Clean???/cheap??? This world has enough natural energy to go beyond a thousand years and beyond  IF we are good stewards. Oil may get real cheap but it’s black gold and it will became a battle too who controls it.
7802 2018-11-10 21:54:56 sariling oil ra biya naga basa nimo
7803 2018-11-10 21:54:52 No, it wouldn't. No oil company is going pass savings on to customers if it can be avoided. Everybody pays world prices. That's the starting point. And, the last thing we want in this climate change era is a reduction in fossil fuel prices.
7804 2018-11-10 21:54:42 The Bible. Psalm 23:5
[5]You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my [brimming] cup runs over.
7805 2018-11-10 21:54:33 Black seed oil  that shit nasty tho .... but so fire for your immune system
7806 2018-11-10 21:54:30 $amrn the reduce it trial strongly discouraged increases In the statin dose. This more likely contributed to rising ldl than mineral oil.
7807 2018-11-10 21:54:29 Organic coconut oil is one of the best natural moisturizers for the skin. If you can't eat it, you shouldn't be putting it on your skin! :)
7808 2018-11-10 21:54:28 Recognising snippets from the Cheviot , the stag and the black, black oil.
7809 2018-11-10 21:54:27 We live in the dark ages of science Elon. Most people still believe compressed dinosaurs make oil. You for instance. CO2 is ok too, it helps plants make oxygen.
7810 2018-11-10 21:54:18 Yes, I agree (at the end of the day palm oil deforestation is very real) - Greenpeace are a political pressure group but they are not mentioned in advert and is this any different to adverts which link to plastic pollution - other than who made the film originally?
7811 2018-11-10 21:54:13 I had a job to calibrate a flow meter in one of the smallest oil fields in Delta State last month.  
With the oil price at $80/barrel, that small field produced about N80million worth of oil daily.  Yet the community was so poor I was brought to tears.  

Our leaders are wicked.
7812 2018-11-10 21:54:10 People like us don't need "bia bia" oil.
7813 2018-11-10 21:54:06 Weigh out eight handfuls of olive oil and raise the temperature.
7814 2018-11-10 21:53:55 L'oreal have a palm oil free shampoo and conditioner too
7815 2018-11-10 21:53:48 My boyfriend is looking for a new job in the oil field. He’s a real hard worker! Any recommendations?
7816 2018-11-10 21:53:41 Iran can pay their clients & companies in 1000 different ways. This is 2018 not 1954. Also Iran has the 4th largest deposits of oil & 2nd largest of natural gas. The world is growing & energy hungry, there's no stopping Iran from selling their resources. It's a fantasy.
7817 2018-11-10 21:53:35 I would definitely try with higher percentage thc oil, and like I mentioned earlier with myrrh, hops and frankincense as suggested by @JindrichBayer
7818 2018-11-10 21:53:13 No the reason is because you clearly don’t believe in “climate change,” which is exactly what’s causing these fires.  Your dirt money coming in from corporations and oil barons are the reason why you won’t stop these wildfires.  These happened in LA exactly last year too!
7819 2018-11-10 21:53:03 "Betting that scientists are wrong and oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history."
7820 2018-11-10 21:52:49 I came for an oil change and for my brakes and brake fluid and smh at what it's gonna cost me
7821 2018-11-10 21:52:48 What will it take for you to acknowledge climate change? How much suffering must we endure? Maybe the economic damage will finally sway you, cuz it's gonna cost trillions. You'll have to decide between your insurance pals, and your oil and gas pals. That'll be fun to watch.
7822 2018-11-10 21:52:41 I will not be surprised if $amrn is down on monday, hope iam wrong, with all the twitter chat about placebo uncertainty being a factor though don’t see anything in the past week that could validate that placebo mineral oil thesis. In the end it all matters what fda thinks
7823 2018-11-10 21:52:39 Did the Chinese really cook the food in filthy oil John?

7825 2018-11-10 21:52:17 Fish oil seems definitely healthier than mineral oil, put it that way ;)
7826 2018-11-10 21:52:11 @BootsUK Have you discontinued the Oil of Evening Primrose rich moisturising cream? I love it!
7827 2018-11-10 21:52:09 Nearly $900 USD for beard oil? FFS
7828 2018-11-10 21:52:01 So for smart ethical scientists you cite Michael Mann? C'mon, man! Oil/gas will have a role to play for decades - if not in developed world, then developing world. Oil & gas are better than burning wood/dung. They are not rich enough for Teslas yet.
7829 2018-11-10 21:52:01 I work in oil and gas. I would like to see a transition, many of us would. But the two sides are working in an either-or frame of mind.
7830 2018-11-10 21:51:54 How many times will you buy palm oil?
7831 2018-11-10 21:51:40 Anybody who gives a shit about Global Climate Change & the general wellbeing of the planet & its inhabitant's not familiar w/this subject needs to google "palm oil deforestation". You'll be horrified by the ecological implications of it.
7832 2018-11-10 21:51:34 we have to say the same things over and over even if they seem banal: 

Western economies are dependent on war, exploitation. oil, & dying economic systems. Wealth clings to power by subverting indigenous people, From Palestine to the Amazon to Nauru, people want radical change
7833 2018-11-10 21:51:29 ABC News: Big studies give mixed news on fish oil, vitamin D

ABC News: Big studies reveal mixed results on who does and does not benefit from taking fish oil or vitamin D...

7834 2018-11-10 21:51:25 No he didn't. And may I remind you of who started two Illegal Wars for oil. Get your fact straight and stop parroting propaganda.
7835 2018-11-10 21:51:22 The scientists. 
I believe the greedy governments of the world don't want to make laws that benefit Earth, because they will loose profit from oil companies, etc.
If governments made laws to benefit our planet instead of only seek in power & money,
7836 2018-11-10 21:51:21 You should try peppermint oil on your temples
7837 2018-11-10 21:51:19 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
7838 2018-11-10 21:51:14 So you want the Earth to die because that’s what oil companies are doing.
7839 2018-11-10 21:51:08 Fracking makes no sense AT ALL. Even tories and oil companies say there’s no need to frack (in UK). Renewables is the only way to go. #GetTheToriesOut #GeneralElectionNow #JC4PM
7840 2018-11-10 21:51:07 Oil money?
7841 2018-11-10 21:50:55 Oil changes are a myth change my mind
7842 2018-11-10 21:50:51 Instead of destroying forest why cant ppl just plant oil palm n make their own oils. Its just a suggestion.  Love the ad ..shared too ..
Love orangutans too..

7844 2018-11-10 21:50:47 The Maze Runner & Divergent trilogies are pretty good
7845 2018-11-10 21:50:37 Absolutely!  I don't understand why they didn't go through that thought process when we all struggled with the oil embargo nearly 50 years ago.
7846 2018-11-10 21:50:32 We can do the same when the oil majors stop exploring and start paying fat dividends.
7847 2018-11-10 21:50:27 Little hypocritical coming from the guy that is selling 100k electric cars and solar panels. Love my model 3 Elon, but you cant point the finger at oil companies without pointing it back at yourself same time.
7848 2018-11-10 21:50:23 Weird how almost every article from the media starts with; "Trump, offering no evidence or Trump, without evidence" 
It's not like the media is pushing an agenda or anything.

7852 2018-11-10 21:50:11 This tweet pained me.  If only you know how much oil comes out of the ground of Niger Delta daily,  you wouldn't be begging bill gates. 

We have a minister of FCT,  minister of Health and  of course a president,  yet we are begging a man from another country to save us.
7853 2018-11-10 21:49:58 War is about money and territory.
 - Mostly oil now.

The reasons smeared on are to gain public support.
Nationalism, religion and fear. 

They all work.
7854 2018-11-10 21:49:58 such as oil.  Other sectors, may continue to grow, including health care (no action there), power companies (no new regulation and dividends higher than inflation and prep for short recession), and banking.
7855 2018-11-10 21:49:50 It's just something about those onions, and oil and vinegar.... it's too good
7856 2018-11-10 21:49:39 I’m gonna be getting a new one Monday hopefully lol Definitely wanna do a video of the process before I glue the teeth and do the oil panting. Still thinking of sculpting top layers of organs too so it’ll take me a bit to get this piece together anyways before I get my new phone
7857 2018-11-10 21:49:35 Forests are under Bureau of Land Mgmt, Federal, you are so busy drilling for oil you aren't paying attention moron.  This is the Fed's and GOP's fault not citizens of CA - but we will let the caravan in so they can help up fix it - more to vote against you.
7858 2018-11-10 21:49:33 Fun fact - dinosaurs have nothing to do with oil. 
7859 2018-11-10 21:49:33 Thread: Olive Oil as victim of #Syria’s War Economy 

In spite of very favorable crop for olives that is usually grown in Kurdish areas around Afrin & North, #Aleppo residents are having to pay exorbitant retail prices for Syrian Olive oil as it gets shipped to #Turkey instead =>
7860 2018-11-10 21:49:29 @Siriusjay TSA doesnt care about weed coming from vegas they are looking for guns bombs ect.  I hid oil carts in some MMs and they dumped my candy all over my suitcase and left the carts. Next time just put it in checked luggage.
7861 2018-11-10 21:49:08 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
7862 2018-11-10 21:49:07 Black seed oil and castor oil are so necessary during cold and flu season. Add a teaspoon of either or to your tea as soon as you feel the slightest symptoms of a cold.
7863 2018-11-10 21:49:03 Sustainable Palm oil is the way. Some countries Palm oil has always been the go to oil for many things. Its the overly mass produced palm oil for western markets that cause the deforestation. Forests should be left to be forests. Plus there are other oils
7864 2018-11-10 21:48:56 Free oil change cause it’s my first one 
7865 2018-11-10 21:48:54 No real downside to getting off oil. Besides, oil is so useful for other things, why keep burning it all up?
7866 2018-11-10 21:48:54 Do you happen to have the yield data on sunflower oil?
7867 2018-11-10 21:48:52 Not a big life hack guy, but if you rub a little tea tree oil conditioner on your cutter before you get out of the shower, you won’t regret it
7868 2018-11-10 21:48:35 What u r doing is great!! But not Everyone is like that. I guarantee only8 of 20 people in a store are aware ofthe things they buy. And this not just an issue for palm oil,this is everything contributing to the damage ofour Planet from plastic and clothing to even the food we eat
7869 2018-11-10 21:48:29 I think we could contain fires very easy if we had water pipelines instead of oil pipelines across the continents.
7870 2018-11-10 21:48:28 I’ve been using @CannTrust 1/1 however I believe that CBDOIL needs to be higher. I’ve been fighting brain tumour, it shrunk but not fast enough. We don’t have access to hemp base oil in 
7871 2018-11-10 21:48:25 So why are we not build another refinery here in oil country?
7872 2018-11-10 21:48:17 You'll have many upset kids over Christmas. Any palm oil food will be banned from home forever. Little militants!! 
7873 2018-11-10 21:48:14 I’m a bit disappointed with the comments saying boycott palm oil. It’s not as straightforward as you think. Palm oil is an extremely efficient crop and other oil crops require a lot more land. Boycotting PO would just result in using other oils which cause more deforestation.
7874 2018-11-10 21:48:11 Coconut oil and sugar. Mix together and dab on your lips.
7875 2018-11-10 21:48:10 Some days I definitely feel less patient then other days. Today I sat in a car line up for over an hour with my mother in law to get the oil changed. I believe I passed that test thanks to God’s Grace. Definitely had to get alone for some quiet time when I got home 
7876 2018-11-10 21:48:05 the problem is the greedy oil company’s would rather make money than do what is good for the earth. human greed will destroy the planet
7877 2018-11-10 21:47:59 Dear Ontario  Quebec Dairy Corporations The West will stop buying American Cheese when you stop buying American Pipeline Oil & allow a WesternOil Pipeline. 47 Que people died from N Dakota USA Train Tanker Oil & you don’t want a safePipeline & U buy Saudi/Venezuela killer oil
7878 2018-11-10 21:47:35 Currently sitting at jiffy lube just tryna get my oil change and there is a man sprawled out dead asleep and snoring hella loud next to me and there are no other empty seats
7879 2018-11-10 21:47:27 Garri + H2O + pepper + palm oil
7880 2018-11-10 21:47:02 It doesn't need to be an experiment. Government over reached it's legal mandate in subsidizing shit. Get rid of oil subsidies, government monopolies, federal regulations, let the market compete, the technology will take over when the market decides it's ready, it can't be forced.
7881 2018-11-10 21:47:02 I used to use a small amount of light vegetable oil on door and moonroof seals, which seemed to work well. Probably not as long lasting as silicone, but everyone has it at home.
7882 2018-11-10 21:46:55 1. Dinosaurs aren't the major ingredient in oil. 

2. Shutting down the oil industry (billions of people depend on economically) overnight would literally cause the sort of "catastrophe" you think climate change would. A slow transition (just like slow climate change) is safer.
7883 2018-11-10 21:46:52 Read the NEJM article.  The mineral oil is a nothing burger.  This article is like Trump claiming that Central Americans fleeing gang violence is a national security threat to the USA.

7886 2018-11-10 21:46:29 Any high potency THC oil should give the same or similar effect
7887 2018-11-10 21:46:27 It's not about GDP.  Not sure what's going on, commented hoping for other eyes on this. Oil is seductive. Germany also believes 88% to 6% that China respects personal freedoms. Maybe it's idea of what's good for my country's GDP + ideology+?
Will USA enter WW3 to protect Germany?
7888 2018-11-10 21:46:15 Mineral oil should not be consumed.
7889 2018-11-10 21:46:14 I got into a debate with a friend about this.  He's happy that deregulatons are good for the oil companies, so I pointed out how this admin has put regulations and tariffs on solar panels and other alt energy solutions killing more jobs than he's saving.
7890 2018-11-10 21:46:08 Na wa oh
7891 2018-11-10 21:46:06 Sorry about your neighbors' home, glad yours okay-I do see 2 issues people should learn about. Pine trees R not great in this area. They are high oil content & explode & spread fire in all areas. Untrimmed palm fronds that catch fire will spread to other homes endangering others
7892 2018-11-10 21:46:05 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
7893 2018-11-10 21:45:59 My tip for poaching eggs. Get a cup and line it with cling film. Brush it with oil and crack the egg in. Pull it together and tie at the top then drop onto boiling water. Sorry don’t use timers, just watch til it’s ready.
7894 2018-11-10 21:45:57 Talk about dinosaurs. Problem is the oil industry is a dinosaur. Sure we still need oil 4 lots of things but not really to burn it and blow it into the air. Fortunately most life on earth doesn't run on oil. Most life on earth runs on converted sun energy. Let's keep it that way.
7895 2018-11-10 21:45:46 For the LORD, the God of Israel, says,
'The jar of flour shall not go empty,
nor the jug of oil run dry,
until the day when the LORD sends rain upon the earth.'" 
She left and did as Elijah had said. 
She was able to eat for a year, and he and her son as well; -
1Kings 17:10-16
7896 2018-11-10 21:45:46 If people stil want oil but they need to change, send them to another planet or moon (like Titan)
7897 2018-11-10 21:45:41 we check- you get to know the palm oil things after a while. Slight pain yes but it's only a moment of my time and if enough people boycott it can make the difference between life and death. Struggling to find a decent Nutella replacement but you know, first world problems......
7898 2018-11-10 21:45:35 Just tried getting a small bird off a glue trap (the trap was NOT mine!). Successfully got it off and tried getting the oil off its wings with water & diluted Dawn, but it seems to have perished now. So sad:(
7899 2018-11-10 21:45:30 @realmikefox You should really try oregano oil.  It kills lyme disease.  You may still have lyme.  Watch Under Our Skin.  Many lyme mds link auto-immune seeming diseases to a lyme infection.  Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, ALS, MS, fibromyalgia, CFS, and more.
7900 2018-11-10 21:45:13 I need an oil change
7901 2018-11-10 21:45:11 What's the point of wearing anything on an oil rig if it's going to get dirty?
7902 2018-11-10 21:45:08 Today must be national oil change day.  #valvoline is packed.
7903 2018-11-10 21:45:01 Definitely some good tea :) Mint with sweetener.
Parsley salad with tomatoes olive oil, avacado lemon juice and pepper.
7904 2018-11-10 21:44:52 Facebook, Twitter, Uber. Tech start ups are the most significant American economic phenomenon of the 21st century.

At $11 billion, Saudi Arabia is the biggest funder of tech start ups.

Tech money, oil and arms, it's clear why Saudis can butcher journalists with no consequences
7905 2018-11-10 21:44:50 When your car needs an oil change but you don’t have money or a man 
Guess ima have to learn today (Kevin hearts voice)
7906 2018-11-10 21:44:44 Elon. America is at its worst point possible. Big companies that use oil and gas won't care. In a few decades by now, they will panic because fossil fuel will be running out. And now there going to cover to using energy.
7907 2018-11-10 21:44:41 After listening to bank W I really think the young ones need a chance in politics. So we support @BankyW  and we support MDP(modern Democratic party).
7908 2018-11-10 21:44:38 Oil companies on about hydrogen cars again. Is there a future there?
7909 2018-11-10 21:44:36 Rockefeller’s  Oil via Spain use to provide Oil via Spain to Hitler
7910 2018-11-10 21:44:07 Not dead dinos, that's true. Oil is actually remnant from abundant plant matter that was never decayed during the Carboniferous. Which, you know, IS biotic.
7911 2018-11-10 21:44:02 Foreign reserves arent built up overnight; Jonathan inherited a sizeable warchest from Yaradua, which he ensured was frittered away (during a period of soaring oil prizes). From a paltry $28bn, @MBuhari has increased it to over $48bn. Clearer now?
7912 2018-11-10 21:43:58 I wonder why they didn’t write about how the Doorman was a CCW holder but wasn’t allowed to carry??? 
7913 2018-11-10 21:43:56 Dinosaurs make oil.  Ha ha that's funny
7914 2018-11-10 21:43:53 @elonmusk what do you think of the idea of using algae to supply our oil needs/
7915 2018-11-10 21:43:50 Some rich oil dudes really have to be put in jail. Cos they have so much money and subsequently influence and power they fkn ruin earth for everyone
7916 2018-11-10 21:43:37 have you tried the murad acne line moisturizer?? it is oil free but he keeps my skin hydrated and it has sun screen in it!!

7918 2018-11-10 21:43:28 After my father was doing 4 billion p.a. in oil/gas, I’m familiar with real facts concerning climate change...

Not that agenda crap
7919 2018-11-10 21:43:26 The money you save from changing your own oil
7920 2018-11-10 21:43:02 There seems to be remarkably little literature on mineral oil. Bet that’s about to change
7921 2018-11-10 21:42:57 This wool balls on sale at Trader Joe’s with a few drop of lavender oil will have your comforter absolutely heavenly out of the dryer!!
7922 2018-11-10 21:42:56 Yes. And it turns out the American diet isn’t responsible for elevated triglycerides, just mineral oil! Feel free to enjoy that deep fried candy bar and whopper, just stay off that mineral oil stuff!
7923 2018-11-10 21:42:44 Mate shut up u oil F.C.
7924 2018-11-10 21:42:34 While science is unavoidable, inevitably, the market will decide what it will accept. But I’m radically certain that the unabated free market will provide the correct solution for all involved, big oil will need to accept a smaller market share & different business model
7925 2018-11-10 21:42:30 I know! Oil temperature is also key though! I’m saying is I’m pretty sure that was cooked in a frying pan...
7926 2018-11-10 21:42:25 Once the worlds economy starts really embracing #bitcoin ...it will be A RACE to zero-point energy...

7928 2018-11-10 21:42:22 That is massive, #Vols. Now, hold them before the half and we are cooking with peanut oil.
7929 2018-11-10 21:42:20 Shell oil giant is having power because of federal connivance hence they look superior and lord for their operations in the niger Delta region.
7930 2018-11-10 21:42:19 Mineral oil daily intake was equivalent to about 12 grains of salt.
7931 2018-11-10 21:42:10 Glad your home safe, but when you get back I suggest getting rid of them if the trees are pine. High oil content, burn fast, explode & send HUGE chunks of burning tree as much as 100 yards 2 start more fires. Not good for this area.
7932 2018-11-10 21:42:03 What do you call spoiled pigs who lounge all day while robbing the people and stealing their oil!
7933 2018-11-10 21:42:02 if your that bothered stop selling beef and dairy- because cows are worse. animal agriculture is worse. palm oil is complex the slaughter of 1 billion animals in the uk is not
7934 2018-11-10 21:41:58 Oil is Abiotic and you know it bro. We aren’t running out of oil, anytime soon, if ever at all. I agree with the push for an alternative resource usage though. But you know damn well Oil is naturally occurring, not dead Dinos.

7938 2018-11-10 21:41:33 Pulu helped you out? I still need help changing my oil 
7939 2018-11-10 21:41:26 Is there a petition for companies to clearly label products containing Palm oil or a sustainable rating like the health star?? I'd up to starting if not?!
7940 2018-11-10 21:41:26 @AlikoDangote
7941 2018-11-10 21:41:25 Fair play to @IcelandFoods for their palm oil campaign. Hope the other supermarkets follow suit to make it easier for us consumers @Tesco @asda #gottastartsomewhere #leadbyexample
7942 2018-11-10 21:41:18 Can’t believe Iceland’s Christmas advert has been banned for being too political. I guess other companies are happy about deforestation, the extinction of animals & making a profit at the cost of the environment? Shop wisely this Christmas & cut out Palm Oil.
7943 2018-11-10 21:41:14 can't we just put ugly birds, crocodiles and alligators in an hydraulic press to get to more oil?
7944 2018-11-10 21:41:14 From Beyond Petroleum, to Suncor, I don't trust a single one of them.

People should not trust GM with converting to all EVs, and we can't trust #ExxonKnew Big Oil to convert 99% away from oil production. They've lied before, and will until always to avoid cleaning up.
7945 2018-11-10 21:41:11 Ganancias la iban a bajar.Las retenciones también,solo hicieron gastar en siembra a $42 dólar y vender a $34 más retenciones y aumento de impuesy de todo tipo provincial. Más gas oil, etc, etc. Solo generan que no se venda la cosecha. El gabinete económico es anti-produccion.
7946 2018-11-10 21:41:06 those who do use it for chronic pain for example usually don't smoke it, they take it in pills or oil and that won't make them high.
7947 2018-11-10 21:40:56 fossil fuels are a scam jerkweed, the russians have found oil over 7miles below the surface, deepest fossil....15,000 feet...YOUR A COMMUNIST WAKEUP HALDEMAN JERK OFF, my wife knows you she was married to a haldeman....
7948 2018-11-10 21:40:51 I’m 700 miles due on an oil change
7949 2018-11-10 21:40:49 Maybe. Technology can make them obsolete though, and then the market will finish the job. They can stay invested, doesn't matter, they won't be able to save their precious oil.
7950 2018-11-10 21:40:47 Does running oil fields on 100% renewable energy compensate for/balance out the later use of oil in manufacturing, transport etc.?

7952 2018-11-10 21:40:41 What about #Rwanda investing hugely in the new oil(Data) business?
 trying to think out loud
7953 2018-11-10 21:40:33 It looks like they have pulled back..since the last week of Oct., Saudi oil in transit has declined c.14%..takes c.35 days to get to Houston, so looks like they were helping Trump get oil lower for the midterms...they raised prices to the US immediately after the midterms
7954 2018-11-10 21:40:33 OH BANANA OIL!
7955 2018-11-10 21:40:28 Yasir u retweeted this...i tot u were backing shehu sani ?

7957 2018-11-10 21:40:26 Make the roof a solar panel because if you look up, you’ll see free nuclear energy. Right there... just lookin at us like we’re a bunch of dumbasses, wondering why we haven’t tapped into its resources. While we kill each other over the money our leaders are making from oil.
7958 2018-11-10 21:40:20 Take out the bobbin casing and oil the back.

Did you know sewing machines also get tune-ups, like cars?
7959 2018-11-10 21:40:18 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
7960 2018-11-10 21:40:18 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
7961 2018-11-10 21:40:09 The rise of anti-intellectualism is feeding a growing distrust towards expertise & scientific consensus. I tend to trust scientists, though they are not infallible. They definitely know more than oil industry shills.
7962 2018-11-10 21:40:09 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
7963 2018-11-10 21:40:01 A compete fraud or just plain quart of oil on the low side.
7964 2018-11-10 21:39:56 Lmao that’s a list . Deva Curl, carols daughter , tresseme conditioner & I comb my hair with Giovanni leave in conditioner & water . I need an oil though so if you know any good oils & whatnot let me know lol
7965 2018-11-10 21:39:55 Bajó el precio de la nafta y gas oíl. Baja el precio del transporte público?
7966 2018-11-10 21:39:48 We have about 200 years left of oil. We can shift over slowly.
7967 2018-11-10 21:39:34 Woke up late, went grocery shopping, made breakfast, and got my oil changed. Looking like a good “lazy” productive day. 
7968 2018-11-10 21:39:31 Guys I think ima get an oil change today...
7969 2018-11-10 21:39:31 My father's physician advised  him on which supplements would be beneficial to him.   Fish oil was one of them.  There will always be opposing view points, certainly, but I think taking  supplements would help more than hinder someone's health routine.
7970 2018-11-10 21:39:29 smart cats know that when 45 starts whining, a sane person wants to become politician
7971 2018-11-10 21:39:23 Why does this happen?

Dryness occurs when your skin doesn’t have enough water or oil. Dry skin can affect anyone at any time. You may have dry skin year-round or just in cold weather months, when the temperatures drop and the humidity lowers.
7972 2018-11-10 21:39:15 Correction, the 40% diff between groups.   13% drop for fish oil.
7973 2018-11-10 21:39:13 They get dinosaur oil the same way they get olive oil... it’s horrible to do that to us!
7974 2018-11-10 21:39:10 One more Iceland #Rangtan ad cynic away from banging me head against a wall. No one lied, no one tricked. They raised awareness of palm oil industry and their new policy whilst also driving sales. Rehashing a greenpeace ad to reach a wider audience ain’t a crime 
7975 2018-11-10 21:39:01 Snake oil salesman. Fascinating because he’s a fraud.
7976 2018-11-10 21:38:54 Nahi, it's true.  Actually peanuts are dry tau if you drink water right after eating peanuts, because of  high quantity of fats and oil in  peanuts tau wind pipe main irritation hoti hai.  Jabhi khansi hoti hai.
7977 2018-11-10 21:38:39 Idk why i thought going to get an oil change right now would be fast
7978 2018-11-10 21:38:33 I really didn’t know this wow my family use so much palm oil everyday. this was an eye opener
7979 2018-11-10 21:38:16 We all are. Remember this. It is all about distraction with the Orange Blob of pus. He wants to distract from the huge wins by Dems in the mid-terms. Huuuuuge. Enormous. He knows the people have spoken against him. What does he does, snake oil salesman that he is? Distract.

7982 2018-11-10 21:38:07 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts hemp seed oil with 1 part red wine vinegar and 1 part cashew butter. Add oregano and jam to taste.
7983 2018-11-10 21:38:05 Big oil! That’s why. Try and stop the Koch brothers. Even people who try to live off the grid as long as a power line is near there house have been known to still be charged. 1% will always win and want wars to fund projects. People used to kill over spices now we kill for oil.
7984 2018-11-10 21:38:01 Federal and state governments make more from a barrel of oil than the oil companies. They will never give up that revenue.
7985 2018-11-10 21:37:57  Oxygen bars. "Smart" water. Snake oil salesman are alive, well and flourishing. Need a drink called "Easy Fix."
7986 2018-11-10 21:37:50 Oil doesn’t come from dinosaurs !!! You may want to read James McKanny!!!
7987 2018-11-10 21:37:49 I used to work 9-5 in a stressful job, I became unwell because of that (and other issues) and am now a dad and a wine and whisky shop manager.....the latter is NOT stressful, my wife is an oil and gas  lawyer negotiating multi-million dollar contracts, who wants to define stress?

7991 2018-11-10 21:37:22 if the states doesn't want our oil, we can run east to west, build our own refineries and sell to the world.
7992 2018-11-10 21:37:21 Been so stressed today and emotional. Deep pore black mask on, chamomile tea (2 tea bags) lavender oil on my temples n wrists to relax me n help my head.
7993 2018-11-10 21:37:14 Oil needs an offensive nickname. Dinos are too cute to even ever mention. Proposition: “we’ll run out of arsenic to mine” then people would ask “you mean dinos?” you reply “oh, that’s just an inside joke, people decided to call oil arsenic because it’s basically the same thing.”
7994 2018-11-10 21:37:11 When GEJ's administration was busy sharing the nation's reserves, buying private jets, encouraging oil subsidy frauds, you had no idea it would collapse the economy once oil prices fell, right? And you claim to be versed in economic issues. 
You're a fraud.
7995 2018-11-10 21:37:10 @McVities Just wondering if any of your biscuits are produced with sustainable or no palm oil?
7996 2018-11-10 21:37:07 Feeling good on this oil 
7997 2018-11-10 21:37:02 Bruh Vee Mom Got Oil On her life!!!!
7998 2018-11-10 21:36:49 > acting like you wouldn't do that with an oil pen
7999 2018-11-10 21:36:48 Yep. All the weight on most cars is in the front. Gotta rotate those tires every other oil change or about 6k miles.
8000 2018-11-10 21:36:46 A lot of opportunistic “frauds” out there right now in the industry. It’s like the Social Media Consultant, snake oil salesmen, have found a new place to exploit.
8001 2018-11-10 21:36:43 @elonmusk, listen to the latest @freakonomics pod discussing this very thing.  Hank Paulson, a self-described “traditional Republican” of some moment, laments the fact that big oil is subsidized and that other energies aren’t.  On this, I agree with him.  Let the market decide!
8002 2018-11-10 21:36:40 Most of our money was dumped into oil territory a la Venezuela. We got a gazebo!
8003 2018-11-10 21:36:34 Sodium laureth sulphate is a foaming agent it’s not a name fir palm oil
8004 2018-11-10 21:36:33 The problem isn't "RUSSIA" or it's oppressed people, the problem is the Multi-national Military-Industrial-Banking-Petrochemical OLIGARCHS who profit from chaos and our forced dependance on SAUDI and RUSSIAN OIL that we DON'T NEED.

#Hemp #Solar #USFarmers #Jobs
8005 2018-11-10 21:36:20 The problem will be that this will put the oil companies in direct competition with electricity companies, who are already (slowly) making the switch.  Consumer-driven will be the deciding factor.
8006 2018-11-10 21:36:20 You think oil comes from dinosaurs?
8007 2018-11-10 21:36:04 I'm not in the cult the believes oil is dead dinosaurs. The science religion is for complete morons.
8008 2018-11-10 21:35:59 Because most palm oil that is labelled sustainable isn’t. Greenpeace don’t believe the RSPO standard is up to scratch either. They might not be calling for a ban but they are asking for true sustainable palm oil which Iceland don’t believe they can source hence going without!
8009 2018-11-10 21:35:57 Rose hip oil and this hemp lavender oil are THE loves of my life
8010 2018-11-10 21:35:34 love that avoiding palm oil is gonna be the next Thing
but the vegans are still too radical despite being on this for years 
8011 2018-11-10 21:35:34 40% drop in CRP for fish oil vs 30% increase in CRP for placebo
8012 2018-11-10 21:35:32 Do you think a fossil fuel future favors clean air and water? Is China doing it right with no regulations? Trump wants more oil, and fracking, both bad for air and water. Do you have kids? Their world is bleak?
8013 2018-11-10 21:35:31 He blocked me before you, most of them can't stand criticism or the hate they spew, they want Everyone else to be their subject and remain gullible.
8014 2018-11-10 21:35:31 Elon, why are the oil companies the bad guys?
8015 2018-11-10 21:35:24 Besides, wasting oil on propulsion diminishes our supply of valuble polymers used in making countless products!
8016 2018-11-10 21:35:02 Anyone got any money on David Haye suddenly appearing miraculously in the @SkySportsBoxing commentary box again for the main event? #usykbellew Gets where engine oil couldn’t.
8017 2018-11-10 21:34:58 You do realize that the oil price is cheap because of KSA . If KSA stopped exporting oil , all other countries will jack up their prices so high ! So KSA plays a balancer in this matter 
8018 2018-11-10 21:34:58 Check in on Swarm and get €1 off our organic turmeric mapo tofu with satsuma oil!
8019 2018-11-10 21:34:56 Wldn’t it just.  
But they won’t.

Okay, hats off to them - via this ad they have raised awareness about palm oil, but there is still the huge animal agriculture elephant in the room.  Cattle ranching not only displaces wildlife but causes huge climate breakdown problems too.
8020 2018-11-10 21:34:55 I can see L, M, Xxxl etc, can’t see ‘cunt’.  If that fat cunt really is vegan then he must emit some amount of methane.  Fuck palm oil, it’s all Bell ends fault.
8021 2018-11-10 21:34:48 @adamlevitan Simple recipe. Sending b/c of solo pod ? you answered. Boil 1 lb linguine. After 3 min throw in 1.5 lbs thin asparagus. Juice 4-5 lemons. Pre squeezed juice is a no go. Drain pasta. Mix in olive oil & lemon juice. Finish w Pecorino Romano & pepper. Thank me later.

Will it help you not get cancer? No!What helps you get cancer is industry polluted water, food, soil, air!

8027 2018-11-10 21:34:29 SeanGVarney That is true & should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term.
8028 2018-11-10 21:34:26 This is gonna be a looooong oil change

8032 2018-11-10 21:34:08 Elijah told the woman to use her last flour and oil to prepare meal for him and if there’s some left she and her son can eat it.
And the woman did exactly that.
8033 2018-11-10 21:34:01 Flaky lips? Make your own lip scrub with sugar mixed with olive oil.
8034 2018-11-10 21:33:51 Promises of decreasing oil reserves have been made for decades, yet more is found and drilling technologies improve.
8035 2018-11-10 21:33:47 Always here to hype my niggas up ! And seriously try some castor oil and let it grow , it’s just one month 
8036 2018-11-10 21:33:45 I have some expertise on the subject & an unconventional view. My take is we are seeing a fundamental shift in oil market power to the buy side...but it's only a precursor to a market paradigm shift from commodity to service
8037 2018-11-10 21:33:45 You know coming up with carbon neutral oil and gas synthesis would be pretty darn useful too for those places where the sun sets and windmills are braked because of hurricanes and such.
8038 2018-11-10 21:33:27 My new fav tweet:

We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now & avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the dumbest experim…
8039 2018-11-10 21:33:23 Price of oil!! The west always amazes me! What about the lives of human beings like yourself and me? No price tag for those!!!
8040 2018-11-10 21:33:20 we're just gonna see a worldwide sustainable revolution when an oil company's entire reservatories start to drop, leaving them to invest in those kind of technologies, in Brasil we had some improvements, but only short sighed, nothing at all looking in the future, sad Elon chan..
8041 2018-11-10 21:33:18 Oil companies are just now sticking their toes into the clean energy transition. I think they’ll get there— but I *know* that if they don’t, they will fall.

Elon is leading the way into the future we want, and we will have it. Progress can’t be stopped, only hindered.
8042 2018-11-10 21:33:18 I liked the new Iceland advert can not understand why it was banned. It was what all should understand about the demise of forestation and palm oil production.
8043 2018-11-10 21:33:01 I need an empty oil cartridge
8044 2018-11-10 21:32:39 Also, credit to him on intellectual flexibility. He was once a Peak Oil advocate.
8045 2018-11-10 21:32:31 More like an oil slick.  DJT is known as Teflon Don.  Thank God for that.
8046 2018-11-10 21:32:31 Big oil will have to redeem its investment in the barrel, it is sustainable to have a transition as we have from coal to oil gas and now hydrogen.

8048 2018-11-10 21:32:20 $amrn I glad I learned how dangerous mineral oil is today. Mineral oil can kill you in 4mg doses. Be careful out there tonight ;)
8049 2018-11-10 21:32:16 Well, of course, he says that. The Donald does have investments in the fossil fuel industry. America needs a #greenNewDeal #ActOnClimate
8050 2018-11-10 21:32:12 Elon trolling for free money again.   Had he even taken a basic course in Economics, Elon would understand why we will NEVER run out of oil.  But as usual, Elon is appealing to the 5% at the bottom of the learning curve....
8051 2018-11-10 21:32:08 Because the economy is dependent on oit and thus requires a steady shift to renewables.

Doesn't change the fact that the oil companies/government should do something about it though.

Sticking to your morals here also is a PR disaster waiting to happen.
8052 2018-11-10 21:32:04 Abiogenic oil
8053 2018-11-10 21:32:01 If I ate a CBD oil edible would it impair driving a car?
8054 2018-11-10 21:31:49 This is all dealership associations doing. We have some huge pocketed business men here in Texas that have people In their pockets. Big oil and big dealerships refuse to change. Like oil they are dinosaurs.
8055 2018-11-10 21:31:43 Doing me oil changie.
8056 2018-11-10 21:31:41 I don't think it's the oil producers, they're already rich and they know the best how finite oil is. But there are lots of middlemen (including almost anything car-related for example) whose life would be drastically changed if we went away from oil. And change is bad, mkay?
8057 2018-11-10 21:31:38 There's two things I do with CBD oil.

I have an "infinity bottle" for the drops, where I add the dregs from the other bottles to it, and and "infinity vape pen" that I add the dregs from the pens to.
8058 2018-11-10 21:31:37 For a lot of people with mental health issues marijuana can cause psychosis. Even just CBD oil can have major negative impact on people.
8059 2018-11-10 21:31:33 I have some oil but I broke my vape remember but go with me to get a new one
8060 2018-11-10 21:31:26 Come on now Elon, everyone knows that the dinosaurs are a fabrication to perpetuate the lie that the Earth is billions of years old. God put oil in the Earth for us to use and global warming is a myth. You're a smart guy, be reasonable.
8061 2018-11-10 21:31:22 The biggest obstacle is recreating the infrastructure in our life that the oil industry created. Oil has convenience other resources haven't matched yet. Oil helps prop up farming, industry, the economy as a whole really.
8062 2018-11-10 21:31:13 Stone age didn’t finish for lack of stones,oil one will be the same.
8063 2018-11-10 21:31:10 Oil companies -> transition into energy companies .
Use current extra resources to invest in the transition and be ahead of the competition 
Keep dealing oil 
... Eventually make more money, 
Free money 
Why ain't u all getting on that
8064 2018-11-10 21:31:03 You can recycle lithium based batteries. Once you burn oil, there’s no efficient way to recycle that CO2...

8066 2018-11-10 21:30:50 It’s naive to think renewables could supply the power needed to run factories especially in third world countries who need coal or oil to jumpstart their economies.  The conversion of gas stations would be billions.  Millions years of climate change is not affected by humans.
8067 2018-11-10 21:30:48 2/2 so this evening, since checking i have used the following that has palm oil in it 1) hair growth shampoo 2) chapatis 3) terrys chocolate orange 4) dove soap.
from now on i will not purchase goods that contain palm oil...this will be difficult, but ultimately worth it
8068 2018-11-10 21:30:43 Isn’t it funny that all the states that do control burns never have a problem with forest fires.  We are bless to have common sense and not listen to the snake oil salesman such as Al Gore.

8072 2018-11-10 21:30:27 lol...so true never knew someone would reason so deep.
You see many analysis and you are like seriously.
No one talks of the amount oil sold at the time and how it was used to subsidised the fx market for USD/NGN to be sold at that price..
8073 2018-11-10 21:30:24 I voted yes but there are signs everywhere to vote no. I have a couple oil rigs right behind my house

8080 2018-11-10 21:30:02 Oil is created in the earth's crust continuously. And it's not dead dinos. 

And you know this.
8081 2018-11-10 21:30:01 That and the military likes oil. They control the spice.
8082 2018-11-10 21:30:00 Use your money to make a statement then. That’s how big oil is winning.
8083 2018-11-10 21:29:56 I don’t even remember some days. I for don reach road remember. Thankfully, I almost always have coconut oil.
8084 2018-11-10 21:29:56 don’t need to change oil.
8085 2018-11-10 21:29:54 When it becomes less expensive than oil and gas for the masses of humans who have to pay for it.  Then talk to us. Oh, and dinosaurs?  Ech...  that ain’t it.
8086 2018-11-10 21:29:51 You have to admit that it sounds a little weird to say the best part of your job is taking a deep dive into fish oil :)
8087 2018-11-10 21:29:34 The US considers Canada's oil as part of their strategic reserves
The head of the US Energy Information Administration let it slip during an interview on CNBC back in 2008
They even factor Canadian production into US domestic production stats as most of the producers are US owned
8088 2018-11-10 21:29:25 Oil pays government reps to keep things going their way and certain media outlets to keep things going too.

Car manfs have a lot invested in their engines too. From servicing to r&d 

A lot of people want to keep it just as it is.
8089 2018-11-10 21:29:22 Agree. It's better compare gold vs btc.
Total annual btc mining 6.6 million barrels oil (equivalent)
Total annual gold mining 123 million
8090 2018-11-10 21:29:22 i broke my laptop and phone, and i just lost my card which means i cant fix neither and im already running low on gas and i have to get an oil change and um im so stressed fixing to end my shit
8091 2018-11-10 21:29:15 SeanGVarney That is true & should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term.
8092 2018-11-10 21:29:14 Agree. So start donating to and supporting candidates and elected officials who’d like to do something about it, to help put those out of office who think it’s a hoax or are beholden to corporate lobbyists and oil companies.
8093 2018-11-10 21:28:58 Interesting coming from smo who is fond of Saudi(heard they have smth to do with oil companies)
8094 2018-11-10 21:28:56 @NeilClark66  All one will say here very briefly waiting in expectation  for it to be written and posted ASAP is the obvious Westminster Govt contradictions  over Hong Kong not so long ago, as well as Falkland Is, British Antarctica territory, Oil drilling rights and fishery
8095 2018-11-10 21:28:53 finally ordered cbd oil
going  less anxiety
8096 2018-11-10 21:28:36 So you must help & convince Oil companies to plan their business strategies long term!
8097 2018-11-10 21:28:32 One of the golden rules, a thin oil to draw in all these beautiful little leaves.
8098 2018-11-10 21:28:31 Boiled yam and groundnut oil. 
8099 2018-11-10 21:28:19 Depending on the strength, CBD oil can give you a general overall mellow feeling w/o making you feel high.
8100 2018-11-10 21:28:17 Why do we take 1 event from the bible and turn it to doctrin? I love the preaching but i don't see biblical foundation to give away cloth with oil. Isn't our faith supposed to be grounded on the the word and not by sight? For the love of God, let's keep the real faith 
8101 2018-11-10 21:27:59 That’s just it...oil makes a ton of money, and they line pockets to influence the “non change”
8102 2018-11-10 21:27:59 I always wonder - OIL companies have fathers, mothers, grand dadas and grandmas working - do they not care for their offspring - children, grand children?
8103 2018-11-10 21:27:58 Came in for an oil change and spent $300
8104 2018-11-10 21:27:52 Cottonseed oil
8105 2018-11-10 21:27:48 Stop using coconut oil all over your face it’s going to clog you pores and make everything worse
8106 2018-11-10 21:27:48 Here's my view on this: 
The ONLY reason solar or other forms of  renewable energy isn't as popular as it should be is simple; governments and corporations don't see enough profitability as they do with oil.
8107 2018-11-10 21:27:35 
8108 2018-11-10 21:27:32 We have enough economical oil to sustain the next 2000 years.  Increasing lithium mining scares me.
8109 2018-11-10 21:27:20 Lots of people in power got their money from oil and they dont want to cut off their cash cow, even at the expense of the rest of us.
8110 2018-11-10 21:27:18 Dude. I instantly toss them when I pick them up. They're pointless. Hopefully when they bring in that oil trap or whatever they vault the ice.
8111 2018-11-10 21:27:17 I put some together with coconut oil. It’s a great scrub for almost free.

8114 2018-11-10 21:27:09 can we just ban palm oil already thx
8115 2018-11-10 21:27:08 i’m getting my oil changed but my car is An Absolute Hellscape and I hope to god the car service people don’t judge me about it
8116 2018-11-10 21:27:02 Did BP pay the fine from own pocket or got the fines from the consumers be it high oil prices or other oil services? Same true for Chevron who spilled in Alaska I believe? Fines are not enough deterrent.
8117 2018-11-10 21:26:56 That is true & should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term.
8118 2018-11-10 21:26:51 They cook really fast. I prefer to peel them dry (so they don't get slimy), then toss cube/slice in a bit of oil (1 tbsp), whatever spices you desire, on high flame. Then cover and reduce flame so they cook in their own steam. They are soft/creamy on inside, crunchy on outside.
8119 2018-11-10 21:26:29 Try finding something without soybean oil in it.
8120 2018-11-10 21:26:28 oh well, tough titties...we are here to stay.
8121 2018-11-10 21:26:26 Why is palm oil in so many products..?  And how does it come so ''frictionlessly'' into the EU......?
8122 2018-11-10 21:26:24 Oil companies have more skin in the game than so called intellectuals. Remember peak oil?
8123 2018-11-10 21:26:23 Just ordered hemp oil for my stomach pain and depression. Here’s to hoping this actually works 
8124 2018-11-10 21:26:19 Got two full synthetic oil changes for $80. God bless
8125 2018-11-10 21:26:16 Palm oil and it's ban has been an old hobby horse of mine. It's great at last to hear Iceland is moving against its usage and removing it from its own brand products very soon
 Well done Iceland.
8126 2018-11-10 21:26:15 I've been saying that for decades. I hope you have better luck being listened to. 

Or maybe do it yourself?  Put up solar power says, and put the oil companies out of business. After all, if they want to put up their own, who will they buy rides from?

8128 2018-11-10 21:26:13 Is my nose shiny from oil or highlight? You’ll never know.
8129 2018-11-10 21:26:08 elonmusk: We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now & avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in hi…
8130 2018-11-10 21:26:05 Olive oil?? A topping??? Whhhattttt

8132 2018-11-10 21:26:01 There is oil in the ground in Yemen. Nothing is gonna stop this fucked wolfpack!
8133 2018-11-10 21:26:00 Oh!! I thought it was supposed to be grape oil or something. lol. Thank you for teaching me something new. :D
8134 2018-11-10 21:25:56 Yeah Big Oil might have a conflict of interest in undermining the Climate Change science, but they have no lack of funds, we will all pay dearly in insurance premiums if we do not proactively respond to mitigate Climate Change
8135 2018-11-10 21:25:56 So, received this email from Iceland yesterday... thought 'Ooh good publicity'...now looking in more detail at Palm oil (Thanks to a colleague)...What are we doing????
8136 2018-11-10 21:25:47 Have you ever had Villa Cappelli olive oil? If not I HIGHLY recommend it!
8137 2018-11-10 21:25:44 Totally depends on ingredients. Expensive nut like pecan, $25 might be cheap. OTOH, “house made cool whip” really depends on how organic your hydrogenated soybean oil and high fructose corn syrup are.
8138 2018-11-10 21:25:43 I recommend we do a clinical trial of CBD oil. I’m certain we can show a benefit if the placebo group is coconut oil. Or mineral oil.
8139 2018-11-10 21:25:36 Será con Fuel Oil hoy..
8140 2018-11-10 21:25:32 Just got some CBD oil. Ya girl bout to start making tinctures
8141 2018-11-10 21:25:19 do you have any hash oil
8142 2018-11-10 21:25:15 does CBD oil have any effects that would cause chilling out? Like does CBD = THC ?
8143 2018-11-10 21:25:08 it's high quality, high potency full extract cannabis oil - FECO or RSO but decided to 'bring it back' where it should be and calling it Jindrich Bayer Oil after @JindrichBayer who perfected the method and with frankincense, myrrh and hops makes for #JBOMethod #Cannacuzzis4All
8144 2018-11-10 21:25:07 Hindi po yan lagayan ng pintura, basyo po yan langis (motor oil). Ang baba naman po tingin ng FVP sa mga mamamayan ng Pilipinas. Talagang nasa laylayan ang mga tao kay Leni na parang inaapak apakan lang . Nakakagalit naman.
8145 2018-11-10 21:25:06 I’m living life on the wild side and cooking cream sauce from scratch in the same pan I use to reduce tincture to oil for the old weed candy so strap yourselves in kids
8146 2018-11-10 21:25:05 Maybe because its a sticky diplomatic mess. Basically govts relying on palm oil for their own economic devt dont want the world to boycott because they don't have a back up industry for their farmers.
8147 2018-11-10 21:24:55 Yeah, I’ve heard you use palm oil instead of milk on your cornflakes
8148 2018-11-10 21:24:39 I honestly just cannot fathom why people would resist wanting a sustainable/renewable energy future? Like what’s the negative? I get that a bunch of industry might lose their shirt, but don’t you deserve to this day and age if you’re still investing in coal/oil??? 
8149 2018-11-10 21:24:37 I need tea tree oil
8150 2018-11-10 21:24:37 I do understand your argument but I think they’re focusing on the fact that orangoutangs are endangered and using palm oil wipes out masses of habitat daily, which can’t be replaced very quickly
8151 2018-11-10 21:24:37 It’s not only about oil companies...I love your achievements, but science tells a different story!

Nonetheless...best wishes!
8152 2018-11-10 21:24:15 Palm oil has been growing in West Africa for aeons now
8153 2018-11-10 21:24:15 The message of deforestation is real but palm oil is not the problem. Please don't kill struggling African farmers.
8154 2018-11-10 21:24:03 Right? It's stupid to even take the risk
And to the oil companies: 
Instead of paying lobbyists to push your current agenda, just use that wealth to adapt to the changing industry? Slow oil production and fund biofuel research or something.
You can make plenty that way done right
8155 2018-11-10 21:24:02 woooow it is so difficult to find things that don’t contain palm oil :(
8156 2018-11-10 21:23:58 A good face oil
8157 2018-11-10 21:23:53 Trump did this Trump said that bla bla
8158 2018-11-10 21:23:49 You’re a crook too, Ucater 2the corrupt establishment while ignoring what the people want, like Medicare for all, renewable energy and protecting our environment. You’re bought by the health, oil companies and big pharma. You ma’am are a fraud! We will vote u out when its ur time
8159 2018-11-10 21:23:36 As someone who voted for the third olive oil, I’m curious why the third option is winning. What physiological pretense are we operating under?!  (My own reason is my birthday is December 3 so three has always been my favorite lol.)
8160 2018-11-10 21:23:35 Serious answer. Vegetable oil will help get him free
8161 2018-11-10 21:23:30 I didn't eat any meat, seafish or food cooked on palm oil for last 33 days. Almost done with Great Fast. Feels healthy :)
8162 2018-11-10 21:23:27 one easy thing you could do is simply be more cognizant of the ingredients of the products you buy. the ad is already letting you know that palm oil is one of the more problematic of these ingredients
8163 2018-11-10 21:23:18 Oil dey your head my g
8164 2018-11-10 21:23:12 One of the main reasons of the first world war was the oil reserves in the middle east, we all know damn well why dead dinosaurs are the primary source of energy and not solar. You already know this but I guess you can't really point it out on Twitter
8165 2018-11-10 21:23:10 Don’t use it often, but I bought a jar of choc hazelnut spread called Jim Jams. Rapeseed and sustainable palm oil. Also less sugar. Ok, not ideal but better.
8166 2018-11-10 21:23:07 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.

8169 2018-11-10 21:22:48 Lady 2 booths down is selling CBD oil dog treats. Does pseudoscience work on dogs? "Now doggie this will solve every problem you have ever had, neighbors dog took them, feels better then ever!!'
8170 2018-11-10 21:22:45 Instead of investing in oil pipelines they need to create a new structure that can help bring more water to help fight these fires
8171 2018-11-10 21:22:43 Oh i don't care...stuff her or him Adrian. Anyone else feel free to block me.
Just miss out on my original tweetage.
8172 2018-11-10 21:22:43 Chickens are dinosaurs though. Let's go vegan and convert chickens to oil. I am the science man. Thank you.
8173 2018-11-10 21:22:39 With its vast agricultural potential, Africa’s agribusiness sector is predicted to reach US$1 trillion by 2030. Agribusiness will become the ‘new oil” on the continent, African Investment Forum participants said, fueling the motor of inclusive growth
8174 2018-11-10 21:22:33 Totally disagree Elon. I trust oil companies more than these ridiculous science teachers who get angry when I make my youth football players skip school on game day.
8175 2018-11-10 21:22:25 Ok you are right. But for making batteries for cars there is a Big need of oil so how would you like to Fix that isue ?
8176 2018-11-10 21:22:21 Vegetable oil
8177 2018-11-10 21:22:10 I boycotted goods with palm oil in them a long time ago, when the issue was first highlighted, I won't be party to this destruction and greed
8178 2018-11-10 21:22:06 Finnish media probably already claims that it was Russian GPS interference which caused the frigate to collide with an oil tanker. A couple days ago Finnish media claimed that the Russians are interfering GPS signal in Finland right now because of NATO. :D #russiantrolls #trolls
8179 2018-11-10 21:22:05 Remove the pan over the bottom of oil is falling off the patties on a low heat.

8181 2018-11-10 21:21:52 Farmers are in pain, soybean export lowest in history...trade war disaster is hurting them. China is buying Iran oil too.
8182 2018-11-10 21:21:46 You need to pay off the politicians like big oil does.
8183 2018-11-10 21:21:45 Well because most of the forbes 500 in USA has to do with oil and banks so those bastards would rather use their wealth to keep things the way they are with no regard for the planet or life on it. As long as they have their valueless paper money its OK! Thats why you are best!
8184 2018-11-10 21:21:39 I guess you could say rapeseed too, but I just say rape oil! Nobody looks at you funny when you ask for it.
8185 2018-11-10 21:21:26 We all have questions. Worth pointing out this is a big dose of highly purified Fish oil (2g BD). Reduced CRP too. Those p values suggest it is real, although high risk patients!
8186 2018-11-10 21:21:19 Your 100 ml oil blend is out of stock at the moment.

8189 2018-11-10 21:21:02 @foundmyfitness another study undermining effectiveness of fish oils in prevention of cardiovascular diseases. What's your overall evaluation on fish oil supplements, any use or just placebo? I personally still take them for possible neuroprotective property
8190 2018-11-10 21:20:59 Time for a cardiovascular disease outcome trials of CBD oil.  I guarantee a positive outcome if the control group is coconut oil.  #learningfromimproveit #AHA18

8192 2018-11-10 21:20:40 There’s too much money now. They don’t wanna piss off their oil sponsors and friends w lots of money and power.
8193 2018-11-10 21:20:28 even olive oil. Or writing xx
8194 2018-11-10 21:20:21 Because oil execs lobbying lowkey control our government
8195 2018-11-10 21:20:01 It was in the mid-1970s that the British Pharmacopoeia, a publication of medical substance quality standards for the UK, released a licensed cannabis tincture which featured CBD in full-spectrum oil intended for therapeutic usage. #cbd #cbdoil #discusscannabis #cannabidiol
8196 2018-11-10 21:19:51 seems a bit odd though... isn't grease the icky dirty stuff that comes out of dirty kitchens or the result of cooking fat? oil is a bit different and quite pure in comparison, especially EVO oil, which is what you're supposed to use on pizza...
8197 2018-11-10 21:19:42 I swear man i just made a new batch of oil 
8198 2018-11-10 21:19:22 Teach you to be positive about #UKOG LOL.x ;)
8199 2018-11-10 21:19:17 Saw a grocery store have #bulletproof coffee for $26 for a LB! The coffee was also good until the end of next year? People, this is not a good thing! Just cause you add butter and coconut oil to it, doesnt make it better!
8200 2018-11-10 21:19:16 Take that back, the L2 leaked oil and so does the WD
8201 2018-11-10 21:19:11 He pays for my sister cable my uncle's cable. Even paying my sister oil bill. Now apparently my uncle funeral. The list goes on...
8202 2018-11-10 21:19:04 Not sure about best topping, but it's definitely the best oil!
8203 2018-11-10 21:19:02 My cardiologist told me to quit taking fish oil, said it was a waste of money.
8204 2018-11-10 21:18:59 I've had great success at attracting them with valerian,  chicken, pheasant, nip oil and rabbit. But maybe missing a trick by not trying yogurt 
8205 2018-11-10 21:18:56 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
8206 2018-11-10 21:18:51 I’ve come to pour my praise on Him like the oil from Mary’s alabaster box
8207 2018-11-10 21:18:45 I've tweeted a lot in the last 36 hours about the #Iceland #PalmOil ad.
And it's great to see the response.
But you should think beyond the ad, and look to change your habits.
Check the ingredients of things you buy, and if it contains Palm Oil, put it back on the shelf. #Rangtan
8208 2018-11-10 21:18:38 Lev14:10  And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.  #BibleVerse
8209 2018-11-10 21:18:29 I’ve never seen an allis not leak oil the 8000 series don’t ride super good but that’s because they shortened them up so much over the 7000
8210 2018-11-10 21:18:24 Awesome news. It's just the oil filter that's broken. Jeep will be back on the road within the next week!!!!
8211 2018-11-10 21:18:20 By all means like and share this brilliant advert to raise awareness. Then check ingredients and stop buying unsustainable palm oil - they only use this sh1t because people “demand” the cheap toiletries and food that it goes into. It’s a trade in our ignorance that we can stop...
8212 2018-11-10 21:18:15 When the guys at Valvoline give me a huge discount on my oil change (,:
8213 2018-11-10 21:18:02 Yea I use baby oil on my hair keeps it curly
8214 2018-11-10 21:17:50 We can adjust strategic non-governmental organizations or collaborate with consortia that illuminate ocean oil reserves. Namaste.
8215 2018-11-10 21:17:50 @IcelandFoods this isn't about the palm oil ad (though of course I approve of it) - just a note to say I appreciate the money spent on sending out letters re: data breaches, even though the breach wasn't yours. Have changed passwords across the board, thanks.
8216 2018-11-10 21:17:45 You bad folks for pushing this crap.  FDA approved mineral oil in placebo already.  Very commonly used in placebos.   Just stop!
8217 2018-11-10 21:17:41 I believe many African and Middle Eastern countries would appreciate since potable water will be more precious than gold,  oil or precious stones and metals
8218 2018-11-10 21:17:18 Será con fuel oil  hoy? 
8219 2018-11-10 21:17:12 thsi guy is starting up his old car and it smells SO HEAVILY OF OIL(?) thanks dude
8220 2018-11-10 21:17:11 ive deep fried turkey in peanut oil. ive done pan frying of chicken -- not a full submerge just 1-2 inches -- in coconut oil.
8221 2018-11-10 21:17:10 Stop using products with palm oil
8222 2018-11-10 21:17:05 Sure looks it, Judy. The main problem about Islam in the west is that the ‘left’ is confused about it. I’ve always thought being a leftist meant standing up to theocracy? We live in strange times for sure. Of course, our politicians being addicted to Saudi oil money doesn’t help
8223 2018-11-10 21:17:03 Eh mana
8224 2018-11-10 21:16:59 It’s just outside the town of Saline, so I was hoping for brine. But DI well card says oil. So “conventional!”
8225 2018-11-10 21:16:52 SISTERS U DONT NEED HARMFUL CHEMICALS 2 REPAIR DAMAGED HAIR
PLZ USE NATURAL OLIVE OIL TEATREE & EGGS 2 HEAL THE SCALP & GROW HAIR!
8226 2018-11-10 21:16:50 Even sustainable palm oil is difficult to govern , proctor and gamble agreed to use it but have defaulted on it, cant it be substituted with vegatable oil.or rapeseed oil, its obviously achievable Iceland foods are doing it
8227 2018-11-10 21:16:50 Quoting Smedley Butler:

"There are only 2 things we should fight for. One is the defense of our homes & the other is the Bill of Rights."

No mention of oil, gold, pipelines, banksters, dollasr, foreign protesters, other things U.S. service-people have been murdering for lately.
8228 2018-11-10 21:16:50 CBD oil is the shit
8229 2018-11-10 21:16:32 Get a good oil change in would be recommended.
8230 2018-11-10 21:16:32 That and cbd oil 
8231 2018-11-10 21:16:23 @LindaFoods Today I discovered that you use PALM OIL IN YOUR VEGETARIAN SAUSAGES. OH Dear..
8232 2018-11-10 21:16:20 My 190 leaks oil, but I think they ride nice. Better than a IH....
8233 2018-11-10 21:16:19 I saw the berries throw their hooks into the soil
Felt the blood between us churning thick as motor oil
8234 2018-11-10 21:16:09 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, but Libya.
8235 2018-11-10 21:16:04 We supply equipment to regimes for internal repression, we supply arms and military assistance for external aggression, we buy their oil.  All this must cease if we believe in human rights and press freedom.
8236 2018-11-10 21:16:02 Oil change, fluids topped off, carwash & vacuum, and a full tank of gas. 
8237 2018-11-10 21:16:02 No currently planned pipeline will make any real difference to domestic supplies. Tar sands bitumen is for export. We'll still need imported oil.

Why are you lying about this?
8238 2018-11-10 21:15:56 got my oil changed and put air in my tires and choreographed a dance and i’m! a! grown!!! woman!!!!
8239 2018-11-10 21:15:49 I’ve never been more invested in a movement than saving orangutans and banning palm oil.
8240 2018-11-10 21:15:44 Is JELIS trial, using 1.8g EPA with no mineral oil placebo issue with 19% RRR, already a second trial ? $AMRN
8241 2018-11-10 21:15:42 Wow, canola oil? Not a good replacement for butter or margarine.
8242 2018-11-10 21:15:39 Oil caindo antes do inverno no hemisfério Norte. Sei.. sei... e ainda tem muita gente que acredita que esta commodity defini-se preço somente por O x D. Não caiu a ficha ainda... 
8243 2018-11-10 21:15:34 I think she was definitely trying to display a direct connection between oil prices and minimum wage. Regardless, minimum wage doesnt impact the cost of goods/services to the degree that she thinks
8244 2018-11-10 21:15:28 This lady just came into my work to buy CBD oil and was telling me about how she cured her husband of cancer by suppositories of CBD. Like CBD up the butt. I love my job
8245 2018-11-10 21:15:26 @carsonmorton an oil painting that has a cactus in the background. My annual holiday card. :)
8246 2018-11-10 21:15:24 The oil we use is Brent. If it comes down, Pakistan's import bill is reduced. NOT international oil price
8247 2018-11-10 21:15:20 In Morrison's text, constantly interrupting itself as oil; the dynamics of the Outside is undisturbed by and reproduce Beauty
8248 2018-11-10 21:15:14 scream thank u !!!! add oil to u too TT_TT
8249 2018-11-10 21:15:12 The oil in this soup looks suspicious 
8250 2018-11-10 21:15:02 We had the same issue, your car hasn’t used a lot of oil it’s just telling you it has. The system uses the number of times the car has been started to calculate. So when it says 0% it’s probably more like 60%.You probably have plenty of oil left. This is also  better than a VW.
8251 2018-11-10 21:15:02 They are also crying for us.
8252 2018-11-10 21:15:00 Mam’s afraid I’m going to spike her with CBD oil maybe she should mellow out duhhuuuuuhhde
8253 2018-11-10 21:14:13 I have coconut oil and a bootie sock on it. I ended up taping it up because he keeps trying to rip it off. I dont have a collar but worse comes to worse I will buy one.
8254 2018-11-10 21:14:08 I’m literally always asking this but anyone have any recommendations for an oil/serum/moisturizer for super dry but acne prone skin??? I found a really good cleanser but neeeeed more hydration lol
8255 2018-11-10 21:14:07 Baba ya shigo gari
8256 2018-11-10 21:14:01 I thought the inability to rely on oil meant that an independent Scotland wasnt viable - well , so the unionists said in 2014. Could it be they were being untruthful???
8257 2018-11-10 21:13:58 It's something really stupid because it says it's used in shampoo but not all shampoo companies use palm oil
8258 2018-11-10 21:13:38 Joel just gave me a full-body massage with baby oil. Ugh. 
8259 2018-11-10 21:13:37 Tired of being single..want a woman to cook for give hot oil massages to..travel n stack  is that too much to ask for...I'll buy u snacks too
8260 2018-11-10 21:13:32 1. The ad was originally done by Greenpeace and, as I understand, Iceland bought it knowing it would be banned. The original ad was to pressure supermarkets to stop using palm oil. Iceland doesn’t use palm oil in its own products but it still stocks products using palm oil.
8261 2018-11-10 21:13:31 I have potato slices in the oven for dinner!, little bit of rape oil, and smoked paprika, garlic and salt! Oh and Hellman's Vegan mayonnaise!!
My body is ready! 

I LOVE POTATOES!!! ‍‍
8262 2018-11-10 21:13:31 I was tryna say you aint gotta lie Craig but I fucked up. And agreed. Motor Oil.
8263 2018-11-10 21:13:11 I've already switched to Lush. They are the only mainstream company's timely striving to eliminate palm oil from their cosmetics. And their solid shampoo is brilliant.
8264 2018-11-10 21:13:08 Does virgin oil exist or you can only buy extra virgin oil
8265 2018-11-10 21:12:56 A company like @IcelandFoods does the right thing and shuns palm oil. Controversy ensues. #capitalism.
8266 2018-11-10 21:12:54 Because they’re the only chain supermarket trying to eliminate stock made with palm oil, I think they came out in March with their palm oil elimination plan.
8267 2018-11-10 21:12:53 Having a shitty day. So instead of crying in bed all day I put coconut oil in my hair, got a super large chocolate bar, put in DBZ and now I’m ready to cry in bad all day.
8268 2018-11-10 21:12:52 Mam do u drive @Tesla ? Dont you use AC?, And couldn't hear your thoughts on Farmers burning left of Sugercane harvest, who know's they might say burning oil lamp in temples causes air pollution instead use candles! Just curious!
8269 2018-11-10 21:12:42 So an advert highlighting the adverse effects of deforestation re: the Palm Oil trade is banned. But an advert making light of the Titanic isn't 
8270 2018-11-10 21:12:39 Big fan of Ford but the reason gas prices are falling is more to do with the price of oil vs his 5-10 cent cut.

8272 2018-11-10 21:12:28 sushi rice done right with some shredded dried seaweed, sesame seeds, salt, sesame oil and rice wine vinegar??? 
8273 2018-11-10 21:12:16 Even if you had one you don’t want to deal with the expensive maintenance on those luxury cars. Over $100 just for oil changes alone. NO THANK YOU!!!
8274 2018-11-10 21:12:10 Hi beautiful people, I’m trying to not consume palm oil, and it’s damn difficult. If anyone knows any vegan products without palm oil that they would recommend I’d be really grateful. Hope you are all having a wonderful Saturday. #vegan #PalmOilFree
8275 2018-11-10 21:12:07 Actually this is more evidence of climate change that you continue to ignore.   In your children's and grandchildren's lifetimes they will experience human suffering on a massive scale unless you stop putting the profits of oil corporations in front of environmental protections.
8276 2018-11-10 21:11:49 asian mom said some crazy food critic rated her 4.5/5. He docked half a point cause he saw some oil on her shrimp pancake thing
8277 2018-11-10 21:11:37 曲学阿世の徒ですね。
8278 2018-11-10 21:11:22 Maybe there was snake oil in the placebo?
8279 2018-11-10 21:11:18 Obviously he went after 2 white men too this week. You’re a race baiter and modern day snake oil salesperson. I bet college you - with all the dreams of making a difference in the world - would be sooooo pissed.
8280 2018-11-10 21:10:58 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
8281 2018-11-10 21:10:50 I'm sure if these ex forces that are homeless and struggling had traces of oil in their blood they'd all be rounded up and a siphon tube stuck up their arse... other than that these bastrt elitists will be forever grateful for cannon fodder...
8282 2018-11-10 21:10:45 oil change place fixing my tire pressure bc I’m too lazy to do it myself... god is so good
8283 2018-11-10 21:10:35 Off the top of my head, the chart could be top contributors to 2015 oil production growth.
8284 2018-11-10 21:10:21 @iam_Davido needs to apologise to @HNNAfrica . How the hell will he say she should go and oil her p**sy. That's a very big insult to someone old enough to be his mom. Na Deji I blame for all the shit on David.

8288 2018-11-10 21:10:03 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
8289 2018-11-10 21:09:51 I am one of such people. I am disabled. I survive on a pittance from SSDI. I can’t afford food, but got lectured by a nurse yesterday how I better find the extra $$ to buy Mylanta & mineral oil & btw, the extra gasoline to get to ANOTHER office visit. There are no extra $$.
8290 2018-11-10 21:09:26 
8291 2018-11-10 21:09:25 im literally gonna run out of oil and i am getting nothing so bye
8292 2018-11-10 21:09:14 GTI parts are coming in left and right. Got my Schimmel Performance oil filter housing in (thanks Bill). Also the first run of transmission parts. 

Now I have to clean up the case, and swap out some parts.
8293 2018-11-10 21:09:12 ive fallen back into using oil pastels and its been a wonderful thing
8294 2018-11-10 21:09:04 Then why isn't the NEJM concerned about this? Did you read what they had to say about the mineral oil?
8295 2018-11-10 21:08:59 For sheet wings, I toss 'em in a high-heat oil (canola, peanut, sunflower seed), salt, pepper - and depending on what flavors I want - the rest of the spice mixture.

Then I just bake 'em at about 425 AMERICAN UNITS until they reach internal temp. Not deep-fried, but still crisp.
8296 2018-11-10 21:08:58 The Iceland ad wasn't banned, it just wasn't approved because it's a political ad, if it was approved the pro palm oil people would be well within their rights to buy ads too and with the money they have we'd all hate orungutans and bathe in palm oil to spite them.
8297 2018-11-10 21:08:51 My wife does nail art for fun and swears by an unholy amount of jojoba oil on her cuticles 8,000 times a day to strengthen nails.
8298 2018-11-10 21:08:39 Lol check the date of the tweet its 2012 girl
8299 2018-11-10 21:08:29 tea tree oil really helped me get rid of mine! just keep saline soaking and then apply diluted tea tree oil afterwards, there’s really not a lot u can do otherwise though it’s annoying as fuck but keep with it
8300 2018-11-10 21:08:07 Don’t be fooled be an educated consumer... FONT BUY PALM OIL PRODUCTS. Help save the Amazon rain forest

8306 2018-11-10 21:07:19 I know this is a long shot but if you can somehow get ahold of clove essential oil..it really helps with tooth pain!! I used to use it for my wisdom tooth when it was coming in 
8307 2018-11-10 21:07:14 Oil is in a bear market,  but what would you know about that, WSJ  = fake news.
8308 2018-11-10 21:07:07 There is enough oil on our continent + renewables to end your dependance on the Saudis... build the pipelines, compensate the farmers by letting them grow weed ... enough with the bullshit.
8309 2018-11-10 21:06:52 Your have a warrior Sprit of a Scot Ay.  So what's wrong with justice after being servants and subjects. When you need a militia protect oil .and don't ask permission we Scots have needed justice for centuries .Westminister    Scotland for Scots  Castles OIL local Scots only army
8310 2018-11-10 21:06:50 My friend used to put dabs of peppermint oil on for the same reason
8311 2018-11-10 21:06:48 The market usually doesn’t care, and to be fair, even those with large natural gas pipeline businesses also have tons of liquids infrastructure (ET, MPLX, KMI) or have significant processing assets which have margins tied to NGL prices that tend to track oil
8312 2018-11-10 21:06:41 So many selling CBD oil in UK, especially on Ebay, many have no real idea if they are buying real stuff or fake.
Could be putting anything in mouth.
It's a sellers' market and buyers' nightmare.
Maybe @BBCR4Feedback 'You and Yours' should check 'em out? @kevinmousley
8313 2018-11-10 21:06:39 What are you rattling on about? If a second Scottish independence referendum is called those oil reserves nearly disappear - what good can they do Scotland then?

8314 2018-11-10 21:06:28 Fishoil is healthful! It helps your cells rejuvenate!Does it help one disease, probably not. Who cares! Fish oil is good for your overall health!This is a longstanding fact!

8319 2018-11-10 21:06:00 Getting an oil change
8320 2018-11-10 21:05:44 Christmas is the right time. Think of all the extra foods purchased for the holidays, chocolates and other gifts that contain palm oil.
8321 2018-11-10 21:05:42 @McDonald's on Burkhart rd in Howell mi. Thanks for giving me French fries that are cold and taste like old oil and nasty nuggets. I'll never buy anything from you again.
8322 2018-11-10 21:05:23 You mean you want to send Zinke in to hunt more endangered animals, dig for oil and repo all the national parks in that area, don't you?
8323 2018-11-10 21:05:15 And it's whitout palm oil ^^
8324 2018-11-10 21:05:14 Pay all this money and they failed to change my oil. They going to run me my $53! Might mess around and visit them Monday in person.
8325 2018-11-10 21:05:09 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of The LORD for ever.

8327 2018-11-10 21:05:02 I have been to borneo. I have driven for 3 hours through miles of continuous palm tree plants that were once orangs homes. I have spent time with orangs in sancturies who have suffered unimaginably from these plants. Palm oil should be banned. We need to be educated more on it
8328 2018-11-10 21:05:00 Bread and palm oil
8329 2018-11-10 21:04:46 @morakcares cold eba and palm oil
8330 2018-11-10 21:04:35 The waiver given to 8 countries is a big mistake. I just read news that Korea has got another waiver to hold oil money in banks in korea as won & deduct the goods purchase from those accounts. Is this really happening?! This only will help regime to survive longer!
8331 2018-11-10 21:04:31 Should I stop putting mineral oil on my cutting board?! #REDUCEIT

8337 2018-11-10 21:04:08 I don't think there's anyrhing at all wrong with it and it's suspicious if anything. Makes me think the massive companies that use palm oil may have alot of influence.
8338 2018-11-10 21:04:05 Yes Lucas oil!! 
8339 2018-11-10 21:03:40 Think you’ll find the consensus of experts said oil price was going up.

8348 2018-11-10 21:02:48 The oil, the money from selling weapons, other short-sighted greedy b.s. Yeah, all that. Plus racism that causes them to see black and brown foreigners as less important than their bonuses.
8349 2018-11-10 21:02:26 The AHA just published a study today showing that fish oil DOES help heart-related issues, even in people with no inherent risk. What do you perceive are the differences between the studies?

8357 2018-11-10 21:01:46 Typical that this should be banned,,, the powers that be don’t want to face up to the words problems,,,,,, I guess there are cabinet ministers that have shares in Palm Oil !

- Get a Harry's razor subscription
- Shave after a shower, not during
- Use King of Shaves shaving oil on whatever area you're going to shave

8363 2018-11-10 21:01:15 So sad, the problem really lies with the people not being able to hold their traditional, political leaders accountable. Rather they form cult groups and go into oil bunkering business as a way out. So sad...
8364 2018-11-10 21:01:13 Good shout Millie. Its so sad the destruction of forests for palm oil x
8365 2018-11-10 21:01:09 Try castor oil, hair oil, however compassionate to all.
8366 2018-11-10 21:01:07 Add coconut oil to it after it dries, apply it to under eyes to reduce puffiness. Add it to your soil for plants.
8367 2018-11-10 21:01:02 amarin should provide some sort of rationalization in the near future as to why mineral oil was chosen as the preferred control agent.  the 2 journalists covering the story did not make that clear in their articles.
8368 2018-11-10 21:00:28 No...avoid palm oil
8369 2018-11-10 21:00:27 I like them all ways. I just had a simple, yet delicious soup: dumplings, chicken stock, ginger, garlic, toasted sesame seed oil and soy sauce.

8371 2018-11-10 21:00:17 Laws such as the oil drilling in alaska and thing alike I don't agree with personally but he has passed some good laws so it's just about weighing the good with the bad
8372 2018-11-10 21:00:12 How has my mum just said to me ‘your body is like an engine and your period is an oil change’
8373 2018-11-10 21:00:10 Or melt all over U like almond oil.
8374 2018-11-10 20:59:59 Haven't I seen times articles recently saying meat is giving us cancer and killing the planet, vegan diets are poor quality and lack nutrition and coconut oil is poison. What do we eat? The times itself?
8375 2018-11-10 20:59:58 You man probably makes his mom take his car in for a oil change
8376 2018-11-10 20:59:54 Maybe they shoult replace their battleships with oil tankers for war.
8377 2018-11-10 20:59:51 We can blame the gov't, but the producers must shoulder part of the blame. They should all shut in approx 5% of oil prod and approx 7% of all nat gas prod, then they would receive world prices, less trans costs. Their mandate needs to be "make money" instead of "grow production."
8378 2018-11-10 20:59:50 I have a terrible cardiac history within my immediate family. My numbers were bad. Cardiologist put me on fish oil 3x per day in 2004. So far, no cardiac "events." I'm staying with my fish oil.
8379 2018-11-10 20:59:50 People are superstitious. They literally want magic, and plenty of faux hedge witches will deliver some sort of snake oil. Or, essential oils. 

These folks consult shamans! Fake shamans, white kids from the burbs who’ve been to shaman workshops. Quite a racket.

8381 2018-11-10 20:59:39 We discovered Oca last year, courtesy of @Riverford - wish we could get hold of more! Taste of citrusy potatoes - absolutely delicious steamed or sautéed in olive oil
8382 2018-11-10 20:59:33 Chicken and the egg, if oil decrease offers respite demand numbers will increase and if  and the  agree a deal
8383 2018-11-10 20:59:31 It’s hard to know what to use. Olive oil might be beneficial. One reason is people use mineral oil (as a laxative) so people thought it was safe.
8384 2018-11-10 20:59:31 This will save hardworking people from buying 100k worth of equipment,getting berated for a “too expensive” oil change, the price of which been the same for a decade, then having you all refuse to fix the emissions system that exists to protect the air you breathe. Perfect...
8385 2018-11-10 20:59:29 Great late breaking session at #AHA18 with benefits for both primary and secondary prevention trials. Fish oil works and good evidence for lipid lowering for primary prevention in older patients

8393 2018-11-10 20:58:38 My oil change cost me $8 thanks to @FCPEuro and considering my car likes to eat, leak, and do just about anything but properly use oil and is an n54, their lifetime warranty is much needed on oil and many other parts
8394 2018-11-10 20:58:33 Air is rancid here, I was outside for 20 mins and feel sick. Also I should've only been outside for 10 mins but I just had to try the new dabs before changing oil in the generators (come on pull it together)

8398 2018-11-10 20:58:08 Hello Ms. Stacey, ginger - but I like to roast it with my carrots. if soup is already made try adding in a teaspoon of coconut oil or my favourite is adding in some lemon grass and top with a few roasted pumpkins seeds. 
8399 2018-11-10 20:58:06 I mix used grounds, course sugar and coconut oil for a great pre-tub body scrub. My BF loves having a coffee sugar scrub on the weekends too.

 I purchased a CBD oil across our state line and it did nothing for me.

8402 2018-11-10 20:57:32 Oil drilling & climate change have eviscerated populations of animals who dwell in the polar regions. One day not long from now there will be no such thing as a wild polar bear or emperor penguin.
8403 2018-11-10 20:57:28 You should sell products with properly regulated palm oil. Encourage the proper regulations. Better to stop selling meat and dairy.
8404 2018-11-10 20:57:27 it’s gonna take like 3 hours for them to change my oil so why not eat and draaaaaank

8407 2018-11-10 20:57:10 The iceland ad made check a ton of labels in my house and so much of the food I eat has palm oil QAQ
8408 2018-11-10 20:57:07 Is the real issue here that Palm oil is a main part of biofuel? Do we need to keep palm oil producing coutries happy perhaps because of this? Or is there an accusation that we are discriminating against palm oil producing countries? What are our politicians not telling us?
8409 2018-11-10 20:57:03 placebo group lipid profile deteriorated —  1. Why does one expect it to be stable in these individuals? Perhaps, mineral oil (not absorbed) altering absorption of other lipids? 2. brings into question magnitude not the direction of effect (of vascepa). $AMRN
8410 2018-11-10 20:57:02 ...historically there has been quite of bit of oil & gas drilling in MI. not sure what the recent trend has been...but there is the Antrim (?) Shale play there...
8411 2018-11-10 20:56:58 Big oil dumped millions to fight this here. And some on the left argued it didn’t go far enough, that it needs to be federal measure - which has some validity.

8412 2018-11-10 20:56:54 Do they still use palm oil?

8414 2018-11-10 20:56:48 The transition has been from solid coal to liquid crude oil to gas hydrogen; we are now between natural gas and hydrogen.
8415 2018-11-10 20:56:44 Pretty sure it would only carry highly discounted oil there anyways so, no big loss.
8416 2018-11-10 20:56:40 Just peep his parents names please
8417 2018-11-10 20:56:39 Ban. Other oil crops may have lower yields but could be grown in non-biodiversity hotspot areas.
8418 2018-11-10 20:56:30 I find it amazing that some CDN’s think that this fight is entirely about the environment, the USA is getting our oil at a fraction of what it’s worth and other countries such as Russia and Saudi benefit greatly if our oil is landlocked.
8419 2018-11-10 20:56:25 Some areas around Redding have become overgrown with manzanita, a bush with a high oil content.
8420 2018-11-10 20:56:23 Question. If companies don't use palm oil then what would they use? They are just going to switch from one to another, and thus cause the same issues all over again but with something else (coconut oil anyone?)
Surely sustainable, fairtrade and a little variety is better?

8423 2018-11-10 20:55:46 Do you know why though? Because Iraq, under Maliki changed the way it did business with oil company’s. Maliki turned the system upside down so that Iraq made the most money from oil as opposed to the oil companies.....
8424 2018-11-10 20:55:41 Now I’m here trying to get this oil change
8425 2018-11-10 20:55:37 Between 1999 to 2003, oil never sold above $40. But @atiku and Obj govt were able to pay off our debts and save in foreign reserve up to $60b.

Stop excusing Mr Lifeless for his FAILURES!!!
8426 2018-11-10 20:55:26 Snapped the oil drain plug while trying to do an oil change on the ST... today is wonderful!!!

8429 2018-11-10 20:55:08 no, i don't, other than the intuition that amarin may theorize that mineral oil is more of an non-interactive agent as it passes thru the GI system, which, until proven, is indeed a huge leap of faith, that the mineral oil is not absorbed at all, or does not interact in the gut.
8430 2018-11-10 20:55:02 So I used a muscle relaxer, lemon and rosemary essential oil mix in my diffuser and now I’m waiting on my Popeyes

8435 2018-11-10 20:54:46 Not just that, often unwieldy. @yuvalweber is spot on about annual reports for the oil and gas majors, unlikely to work for coal and again, country-specific data usually absent.
8436 2018-11-10 20:54:45 Well... with oil maybe I won’t be so much of a trouble 
8437 2018-11-10 20:54:42 Or, Iranians will rise up against the corrupt theocracy. There's a complacent middle class that has lived well on oil revenues for many years. Starve them onto the streets!
8438 2018-11-10 20:54:31 AHL. Trade will not get them a good return, time they develop this player. Although he may want out now. Oil need to be better with their kids.
8439 2018-11-10 20:54:30 I never said don't care about palm oil. I agree we need to care about both.
8440 2018-11-10 20:54:11 Have you tried acupuncture or reiki for dogs? I've heard a ton of good about both. CBD oil also is supposed to help.

8443 2018-11-10 20:53:40 My dear @Rsaloust got some “serenity oil” from a sip ‘n shop party. She tried it on the JRT.

8447 2018-11-10 20:53:13 And you seem to have a complete lack of understanding when it comes to geography and the location of relevant oil producers in relation to the Asian market you believe we can gain market access to at the snap of a finger.
8448 2018-11-10 20:53:09 Oil prices have been dropping for 11 days now. Losing 20% in that time, but petrol has dropped by 2 pence a litre. Something is not adding up.
8449 2018-11-10 20:52:58 They've got me as a customer! They are not using palm oil. Good for them!

8453 2018-11-10 20:52:24 We shrinks repair. No reverse exists.

And I know the MMJ folks want MMJ & CBD oil to be the panacea. I would love it to exist, too.
It doesn’t.
MMJ/CBD is a short to medium term set of bridge chemicals. Overstimulation of the endocannabinoid system *promotes* anxiety & paranoia.
8454 2018-11-10 20:52:23 For that time how much Nigeria are selling crude oil per barrel? 
It seems freaquantly you're engaging on non profitable business.
8455 2018-11-10 20:52:21 @iceland_foods Love your ad. However . Do you still sell products with Palm Oil in them ?
8456 2018-11-10 20:52:01 I wish Shell, BP et al would just turn around and say, you know what oil is a shit field to be in and one at the end of its life...We are going to pump the billions we have into renewables and use our deal sea construction experience to build really great offshore wind.

8469 2018-11-10 20:50:23 Many of us Canadians who do not like him, live in an area where their main source of income is oil. One of the few issues I have with Trudeau is that while running for PM, he made it sound like there would be no more pipelines. He has bowed to the pressure of Western CA

8474 2018-11-10 20:49:45 2 things missing in both yours and STAT's. 1. why amarin chose mineral oil.  2. has mineral oil EVER been used as a control in CV studies?

8477 2018-11-10 20:49:17 Typical. You would rather spend more money to still lose, than develop a plan. You ignore that major oil companies are in favor of carbon pricing.
8478 2018-11-10 20:49:08 But if tons of people refuse collectively, then that will decrease the supply of palm oil b/c there will be a decrease in demand... economics 101

A positive point is, several EU countries don't agree & the EU is looking at ways to pay for Iranian oil and other exports without using U.S. $$. it's a good sing that their (former) allies don't blindly fall in line with this US crap anymore
8492 2018-11-10 20:47:18 You are against use of coconut oil but yet selling many products wrapped in plastic packaging....so you don’t care about oceans and sea life .... huh? Please

8500 2018-11-10 20:46:19 It's tough. @TuitNutrition has some advice in her book.  Higher ketone readings are required than for routine keto for fat control. Coconut oil or MCT is the common fuel for that purpose. A cognitively impaired person might not be so cooperative.

8503 2018-11-10 20:45:46 In italy most of my fav cookies brands have dropped palm oil 
8504 2018-11-10 20:45:34 Hmmm backing out of Paris agreement ... gutting epa ... allowing companies to dump in rivers and streams etc . Pushing big oil and coal ...  geez only if we had a president who was capable of helping make solutions to problems! #ActOnClimate #EPA @realDonaldTrump
8505 2018-11-10 20:45:21 Castor oil provided miracles
8506 2018-11-10 20:45:21 Okay let’s try and see if I can find a good shop that will do my oil change
8507 2018-11-10 20:45:20 هههههههههههههههه قاهرينكم آل سعود
8508 2018-11-10 20:45:11 Solid news but I think that note on the mineral oil in the placebo is worrisome enough to keep the stock price down for now. We’ll see.
8509 2018-11-10 20:45:04 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8510 2018-11-10 20:45:03 I know all about the snake oil salesman who has conned you into believing that victims should be mocked & blamed; that gun violence can be prevented with more guns; that domestic terrorists are just “sick people” &  Allies are enemies & Enemies are allies, & he is not a Criminal
8511 2018-11-10 20:44:53 That report wasn't a true reflection of the facts of the ground. They were told and advice not to endorse elections by political opposition in Zimbabwe. But fair enough we will  invite them next time. Hopefully with the discovery of oil
8512 2018-11-10 20:44:40 Yeah a lot of people that want to stop smoking cigarettes will vape cbd oil. They sell cartridges for it
8513 2018-11-10 20:44:34 I like @ChickfilA a lot but man sometimes that peanut oil really does a number on my stomach
8514 2018-11-10 20:44:34 Sixers got Jimmy Butler for two pair of Girbauds and a oil change. 
8515 2018-11-10 20:44:30 Works as a distributor for Forte Oil.
8516 2018-11-10 20:44:21 $AMRN big oops, all inflammatory indicators went up in the placebo arm/ "mineral oil"
8517 2018-11-10 20:44:18 That’s very reassuring! Thanks for sharing. I’d love for it to go smoothly. We’re in a house from 1780 and trying to make her oil free
8518 2018-11-10 20:43:57 Lol my favorite part about going to get an oil change is having dudes at the shop try and tell me that they need to do a bunch of extraneous, overpriced, unnecessary updates when I know for a fact that they actually don’t and they’re just trying to charge me more bc I’m a woman
8519 2018-11-10 20:43:53 The oil has been spilt @JNTM_
8520 2018-11-10 20:43:44 I tried using coconut oil as conditioner yesterday and now my hair looks gross and oily. At least it's not dry and cracking at the moment though?
8521 2018-11-10 20:43:34 Donald have you ever seen fried chicken oil? Describes you perfectly.
8522 2018-11-10 20:43:29 Guess it isn’t what my parents told me, but some of the weirdest things include my entire church actually marching around in a circle like they did around the walls of Jericho during service + family members anointing my house’s door frames with cooking oil
8523 2018-11-10 20:43:15 $AMRN The remaining research question is, is this really due to EPA or is it because of suboptimal dosing from prior fish oil studies. We will soon know from Evanopa. Also the true MOA is still unknown. PS given the data is so good turned long from short since data release.
8524 2018-11-10 20:43:14 Get ready to concede again with your Olive Oil Forehead from Grandma
8525 2018-11-10 20:43:11 Or the time Obama went down the Gulf of Mexico after the oil spill and blamed the local fishermen and rubbed their faces in it.
8526 2018-11-10 20:42:56 Is this pump used for oil industry?
8527 2018-11-10 20:42:45 When you aren't esu laroye ...a ton of palm oil is #100 ..we can't use all
Vegetable is #200  that's even 4 bushel ....#great wives are great economists
8528 2018-11-10 20:42:41 Looks like the fish oil studies were limited to cardiovascular and circulatory effects... What about other body systems?
8529 2018-11-10 20:42:31 wait what how do u smoke cbd oil. Can I put it in a juul pod?
8530 2018-11-10 20:42:29 Jamaican black castor oil strengthen & restore by Shea moisture is a good one
8531 2018-11-10 20:42:22 Couldn't agree more! Palm oil is an environmental issue that more people need to be aware of! I didn't know that it hides behind those alternative names so thanks for sharing!!! 
8532 2018-11-10 20:42:21 in your article, there is no explanation as to why mineral oil was chosen for the control arm, other than the intuition that it is an oil.  why not peanut oil? lol
8533 2018-11-10 20:42:14 60%saturated palm oil in huge percentage of our food now is much more likely to be an issue...people aware when they eat red meat, don't know when palm fat is there, bread, pastry, cakes+puddings, biscuits, chocolate, ready meals, sauces, gravy granules, b/fast cerials, margerine
8534 2018-11-10 20:42:07 Yo @Griz I have several methods of natural anti-depressants that work well for me. Doterra makes the highest quality EOs on the market and they really work wonders. A couple drops of Melissa oil and Frankincense under your tongue or in a capsule works great.
8535 2018-11-10 20:42:05 “The rich get richer, the poor get the picture...” Midnight Oil.
8536 2018-11-10 20:42:04 I at least nailed it on the oil shimmer effect ?
8537 2018-11-10 20:41:58 PSA don’t buy shampoo with Palm oil it’s so bad for those lil guys 
8538 2018-11-10 20:41:56 In Finland we've eaten fish oil since dawn of times.
We still have most highest risk to strokes and heart diseases.
Remembering our lack of light at wintertimes, I think fish oil boost our brain,but not so much lipids in our blood. More vegs,more exercise.
8539 2018-11-10 20:41:51 Thanks Jess! I ended up using oil instead.
8540 2018-11-10 20:41:40 I was up to my elbows in gunked up cooking oil but I got rid of every last sticky spot.
8541 2018-11-10 20:41:38 Hah. If HSBC were hoping to stifle the message, it's backfired spectacularly. I would never have seen an Iceland advert or had palm oil on my radar, were it not for the kerfuffle about the ban. Have HSBC just shot themselves in the foot?
8542 2018-11-10 20:41:33 I've had heart issues now take a number of things that may or may not help.  A daily fish oil pill, Green Tea, Grapes.  More fruit & vegetables.  But you can't get around the fact that keeping off the excess weight and exericising is the best.  I need lots of help there!
8543 2018-11-10 20:41:29 Quorn isn’t vegan, and I rarely eat tofu. Even if I did, only 1% of the soy grown in the us and Brazil goes to us citizens... another 6 goes to feed China, 80-something feeds livestock, and the remainder gets turned into biofuel and oil.
8544 2018-11-10 20:41:15 Nope, everyday cosmetic products. Some everyday products (not food) contain palm oil
8545 2018-11-10 20:41:10 I ate a chip (crisp for the british) and it tasted like motor oil smells like. Wtf
8546 2018-11-10 20:40:54 These boys keep Vaseline and baby oil
8547 2018-11-10 20:40:53 The idea that something like this would be banned for speaking the truth about our precious biodiversity...cowardly.

It's time we realize what's happening to our planet and fix it. Sustainable palm oil, #savetheorangutans #savetherainforest
8548 2018-11-10 20:40:48 Agreed, just good for palm oil and those that make money from palm oil.
8549 2018-11-10 20:40:46 Installed the winter tires on the Saturn. Other than an oil change that will be due soon the Saturn is ready to tackle winter

8552 2018-11-10 20:40:23 Don't forget that the majority of the palm oil plantations in Indonesia are owned by Malaysians who burn off the stubble each year and choke a great many people with the air pollution in the region.. I know from personal experience

The APC led governance lack leadership and management skills even if crude oil sold for $500 per barrel they will still blame the PDP.
8558 2018-11-10 20:39:59 Dude...quit calling it fish oil. No one calls it that at Amarin. Pure EPA.
8559 2018-11-10 20:39:56 This fucking oil enough to last me two years. Fucking YIKES!!! Lol. I’m not mad at all

8562 2018-11-10 20:39:36 I honestly thought the entire country of Iceland was just banning palm oil products.
8563 2018-11-10 20:39:35 It's funny because in Spain it's basically the only oil we use 
8564 2018-11-10 20:39:35 A copy of you
8565 2018-11-10 20:38:50 I’m trying to get a oil change but i got so much stuff to do before i go outside 
8566 2018-11-10 20:38:46 My earth sun and rising trying to plot a life of normalcy and reason until my fire moon comes to douse my ideas in oil, light a match and whisper “let’s make this shit spicy”

8569 2018-11-10 20:38:36 Of course, I forgot catalan independentism told you that Catalonia is the worlds first producer of oil.
8570 2018-11-10 20:38:27 If I spot a product has palm oil in it, then I do not buy it!
8571 2018-11-10 20:37:57 @redbullcrazy the moment you tell Ryan he looks like a @BP_plc Oil spill and he gets quiet lol you know he ain’t ready for the next roast session with us. 
8572 2018-11-10 20:37:53 What an awesome advert we should all watch this. Shame on every other shop who still use the palm oil in there products.
8573 2018-11-10 20:37:52 COW　Crude Oil Washing 原油洗浄
8574 2018-11-10 20:37:43 Companies could not hedge prices above70 as futures in the coming years were around 60 as oil was in steep backwardation this year. So, if companies have hedged for the next years they have again hedged at too low prices and a rise in spot prices will not help them.
8575 2018-11-10 20:37:38 Asia is a CONTINENT.

China is ONE COUNTRY on that continent.

And while we will never get Brent prices, they NEED oil, and as a result will pay more than the US, who really doesn't need it.
8576 2018-11-10 20:37:35 Hunger suld not b the only reason u talk. Thinking doesn't cost u money. Naija survives only on crude oil. How much was crude oil in 2015 and how much is it now? Dey give u peanut and a whole coconut is in der pockets
8577 2018-11-10 20:37:33 Lovely advert but should you not credit @Greenpeace? Also congratulations for making a stance on palm oil and removing it from your products.
8578 2018-11-10 20:37:30 Because mainstream media is ran for profit and US hegemony is based on oil. Networks have a monied and political interest in not reporting on it. Global warming is a regular topic for outlets like the intercept, democracy now, real news Network, black agenda report.
8579 2018-11-10 20:37:26 they make a great scrub for dry skin on legs and arms mixed with olive oil.....
8580 2018-11-10 20:37:24 this cbd oil got me talking to a bunch of random strangers without me profusely sweating from my armpits gang gang
8581 2018-11-10 20:37:04 Down with the Palm Oil in Borneo, you can do it in Europe too, in growth houses.
8582 2018-11-10 20:37:01 I’m giving my hair a break this weekend. I deep conditioned it last night. Then, I applied my oil mixtures and brakes it up... And it’s going to stay like this until Tuesday when I have to work.

8588 2018-11-10 20:36:44 My dad always coming through to help me with my car, anything it needs he got it. Oil change for 30$? Neverrrrrr, my dad does it for me. Need air pressure? Ain’t even gotta spend a dollar cus this man brings his compressor and puts air himself.
8589 2018-11-10 20:36:44 I've read there's no such thing as ethical palm oil. 

And half of all products in supermarkets contain palm oil.

If you think your palm oil use is either ethical or minimal, I suggest you do some research.
8590 2018-11-10 20:36:40 mineral oil, being a petro product, does it just pass thru or there is no clear idea how it interacts with the GI system?

8595 2018-11-10 20:35:50 What kind of oil?
8596 2018-11-10 20:35:44 $AMRN What kind of people poison placebo group so they can sell the snake oil to patients?  Incomprehensible.

8600 2018-11-10 20:35:32 Please remind me to check the oil
8601 2018-11-10 20:35:29 The headline doesn't appear to accurately represent the content of your story; that is especially so concerning fish oil supplements/components and reduction in deaths from heart disease.
8602 2018-11-10 20:35:12 It’s taking to long for this damn oil change I’m ready to smoke  I’m finna step outside inna minute and flame that bitch up 
8603 2018-11-10 20:35:06 Sad news that making a stand on environmental issues that affect OUR planet are blocked for politics. From now on I am going to be far more aware when looking to make purchases to make sure they don't contain any palm oil. Well done @IcelandFoods
8604 2018-11-10 20:35:04 They aren't taking a stand though are they products will still be sold containing palm oil they used a Greenpeace ad to work you lot up and save themselves millions paying for it to be on tv none of the money goes to help the cause so how is that not just mugging u all off?
8605 2018-11-10 20:35:02 can’t wait to reunite with harley in 2 weeks. bouta get her an oil change, full tank her ass, and clean tf outta her. mamas coming backkkkkkkk
8606 2018-11-10 20:35:01 Like I said, I pity those who have to convince themselves daily that 'failure' will somehow bring them progress. 

PS: Cross River is not an oil producing state and Atiku has no proven record of managing state resources successfully.
8607 2018-11-10 20:35:01 They came for the money, chocolates and motor oil only to end up in a filthy cell. I pity the matharoos.

8610 2018-11-10 20:34:54 Not military story, but similar. OA work weekend at scout camp in west Texas. Big boulder in creek. A dad thought dynamiting it would be a good idea (oil country, lots of dynamite). Walking uphill, hear big boom. Watch boulder fly through one side of mess hall, out the other.
8611 2018-11-10 20:34:47 Some clove & peppermint oil on a piece of peppermint candy wrapped in a dryer sheet keeps em 15m-20m away just hang 3 or 4 about
8612 2018-11-10 20:34:41 As some one who lives in WA (and voted FOR 1631), the oil & gas lobby FLOODED the market with misleading ads making it seem like a direct energy tax on consumers.

8624 2018-11-10 20:33:10 NBC: "Drug with fish oil cuts risk of heart attack, stroke, study finds"
NPR, reporting on same study:  “Researchers were unable to find any indication that taking fish oil or vitamin D lowers the incidence of heart disease or cancer”
8625 2018-11-10 20:32:49 Is going to bend over backwards to get oil from us when Russia is next door and the middle east is a pipeline away not to mention all of the offshore facilities in the south China sea. You are living in a pipe dream no pun intended.
8626 2018-11-10 20:32:32 You are ignoring facts. If Kerry is a racist by association then the NDP is against Alberta oil by association...
8627 2018-11-10 20:32:30 To be fair you do use NATO for your own ends most of the time, mostly to fund the oil dollar

8634 2018-11-10 20:31:59 Is that because they are all shareholders in palm oil by any chance! Absolutely disgusting decision. By the same argument then Blue Planet should’ve been banned. Would like to have seen them try that one. 
8635 2018-11-10 20:31:56 Can somebody tell me who the fuc* banned the Iceland advert?
I just watched it on YouTube and see no valid reason to ban it.  Good on you Iceland for stopping the use of palm oil in your products.
8636 2018-11-10 20:31:56 Hi my names Bre and I like to leave me vape laying down on my brand new seats in my car so there’s an oil stain 
8637 2018-11-10 20:31:50 If states persist with an energy policy based on the sale of fuel (whether oil, gas, uranium) that’s what we’ll get. 
There’s much wider benefits from investing in small scale generation, from local renewable sources.
8638 2018-11-10 20:31:48 I was fortunate enough to go to Borneo last year - it was heart breaking to be driving for miles and only see the palm plantations. It’s also amazing how palm oil gets into almost everything   I really hope this creates a drive for change so it’s used less

8640 2018-11-10 20:31:37 if my wife didn't change the oil and the engine overheated and broke, i sure as shit would lecture her, this would apply to anyone, teach them to fish so i don't have to get them another fish
8641 2018-11-10 20:31:28 3,204000 fair price, what's d real location in ikd, what materials were used fr the construction
8642 2018-11-10 20:31:01 Probably just fiber and oil, whatever's left of the bean?
8643 2018-11-10 20:30:51 Gold diggers dig until they find oil
8644 2018-11-10 20:30:47 @m_denniswinters looks like the bots will now shift to mineral oil to hurt it.  Data looks better than expected though, right? $amrn
8645 2018-11-10 20:30:37 So what you're saying is, a company makes an ethical judgement about not using an ingredient that causes destruction but they should not let people know?
Now I know where to buy palm oil free food from, I think that's Ok.
Will the Torygraph refuse their adverts? I think not.
8646 2018-11-10 20:30:36 When the actual cunting fuck did palm oil become an ingredient in every biscuit in the world!?
8647 2018-11-10 20:30:21 1/2 No you can't, you can only find fucking blogs mostly from paid shills in the oil industry and idiots. Virtually all scientific literature from the past 20 years agrees that #climate change is real. There is no debate about the science.
8648 2018-11-10 20:30:21 As far as i know, this is legitimately a robust work on the Nigerian oil sector and economy. Do i need to pay before i have access to read?
8649 2018-11-10 20:30:19 28) i loVE CHARCOAL A LOT LIke its so fun to work with and like you can be as sketchy and free as you want and it still ends up looking cool and professional??? i also really love oil paint the process is really satisfying and its easier to work with than acrylic i think
8650 2018-11-10 20:30:11 $AMRN Also, what is your take on the mineral oil controversy?
8651 2018-11-10 20:30:09 He ain’t lyin. I definitely use castor oil on my edges.
8652 2018-11-10 20:30:05 really sad that the person I airdropped at Lucas Oil Stadium declined my picture of @ChrisEvans :(
8653 2018-11-10 20:29:56 You can't have that conversation without the other factors.

That's an abstraction.
AB production doesn't exist in a vacuum.

And the conversation is about MOVING Western oil. Why AREN'T we talking about moving it east, instead of south?

Irving Oil wants to build an upgrader...
8654 2018-11-10 20:29:54 Unless oil hits $150 a barrel, Alaska will be the new Kansas or Indiana, led by a Governor and GOP legislature that will cut it to death.
8655 2018-11-10 20:29:46 my dad is changing his oil in jeans, no shirt, and his gun and badge on his belt  single ladies watch out
8656 2018-11-10 20:29:42 I mean, I'm not putting olive oil in my tacos...
8657 2018-11-10 20:29:34 Butter or avocado oil
8658 2018-11-10 20:29:22 Get groundnut oil, fresh tomato, thyme, curry, tatashe, sprinkle a little pinch of sugar when cooking as and
Voila!!! You're good to go

8660 2018-11-10 20:29:20 @Sean_Millward the advert has been banned, but they’re anti palm oil advocates
8661 2018-11-10 20:29:13 That's great. We have to ban using palm oil. 
8662 2018-11-10 20:29:11 I like reading stories about how fish oil is bad for you, because one time I broke one open and smelled the gel and it freaking smelled like some nasty fish juice.  So I am just really happy I dodged that bullet.
8663 2018-11-10 20:28:57 I'm the ocean, you're an oil slick
Now I am choking on your thought pollution

8665 2018-11-10 20:28:33 Does that stress you out? I think there is an oil for that.
8666 2018-11-10 20:28:32 Epigenetic mechanisms are just evolving from overly simplified views that we hold on the biochemical responses with a given drug/supplement. An old study suggested that rats licked by their mother will go on to be better mothers. Fish oil? Placebo?
8667 2018-11-10 20:28:28 Go coconut oil, its medium chain fatty acids are less likely to be stored as fat by the body.
8668 2018-11-10 20:28:25 Well that’s the first and last time I use @boilerjuice
Seems to be some confusion between them and @watsonfuels. Disappointed after being told by two people @watsonfuels that fuel was coming today, to still be without any oil!
8669 2018-11-10 20:28:23 They should be required to wait OUTSIDE the country. This would reduce bogus claims that clog the system and allow people to disappear in interior. 
It's not fair to true asylees
8670 2018-11-10 20:28:18 Make I bring oil for u?
8671 2018-11-10 20:28:10 Right. I also manage to consume every last drop of oil lol
8672 2018-11-10 20:28:08 Do we know if there is a causal link between  mineral oil and hsCRP?  Would we expect hsCRP levels to increase over time in this patient population without intervention?
8673 2018-11-10 20:28:04 It’s good ...  but ... the real story is deforestation due to cattle ranching which is a much bigger issue than palm oil. 
I note @IcelandFoods are not doing an ad about that. 
They’ll be still flogging beef products and frozen burgers.

8675 2018-11-10 20:28:01 Burning the midnight oil ...
8676 2018-11-10 20:27:55 For $AMRN bulls - mineral oil is not absorbed. It is used as a laxative. So barring any effect on absorption of essential fatty acid, i dont see any issues here. No position (i made my money). @adamfeuerstein
8677 2018-11-10 20:27:53 My Step Mother Is A Legend... She Just Gave Me A Back/Neck/Shoulder/Arm/Hand Massage... With Oil From Da Philippines 
8678 2018-11-10 20:27:48 That money oil be potent when your account balance changes in matter of minutes and increases by 100.00 for no reason at all!
8679 2018-11-10 20:27:45 The only essential oil I want is Manchurian Tung Oil. Sadly, you can only get it in Oslo.
8680 2018-11-10 20:27:43 I take a sip from that Oil it pull me down to a lower level 
8681 2018-11-10 20:27:26 i wonder if both arms used liquid form instead of gel tabs so the control arm used mineral oil to coax the patients into thinking they were taking in an oily substance.  if both used gel tabs, it is indeed unthinkable...
8682 2018-11-10 20:27:26 Did somebody noticed that #oil started to move down with the #Kashoggi story breaking?
It’s like all the sudden #MBS lost his upper hand, and #trump got an opportunity to announce exemptions to the #Iran oil sanctions. And #SaudiArabia shut off
8683 2018-11-10 20:27:25 People getting their knickers in a bunch over palm oil(legitimate concerns, yes)but still refuse to stop supporting the meat and dairy industries make me laugh (main contributors to climate change and pollution, aaaand not to mention horrific cruelty).Stupidity at its finest. 
8684 2018-11-10 20:27:24 If this has highlighted the issue of deforestation and resulted in less products containing palm oil being sold, whilst also exposing the true reason the ad was banned, then its winner winner in my book!! Well played @Iceland  .
8685 2018-11-10 20:27:21 It's nothing to do with Xmas but destroying trees and wildlife for palm oil it's a statement advert
8686 2018-11-10 20:27:20 I just tried this Beard Oil for the first time and my shit was on fire for a minute idk if that means it's working cus I got dry ass skin or my beard finna fall out, I'll find out in a few weeks I guess lol 
8687 2018-11-10 20:27:19 It DOES however make me nauseous and burp all day, gag and choke and feel ill! #nopesorry I’ll eat my fish oil. In my fish.
8688 2018-11-10 20:27:17 $AMRN As expected.  Observed “effects“ are due to mineral oil effect in placebo as.  $17 or lower on Monday.  Should be $1 really
8689 2018-11-10 20:27:10 The NDP is coping with the fallout from the oil crash. Rather than slash jobs and cut back on services (which the Cons would do again..) the NDP are maintaining public sector employment levels and stimulating the province’s economy using borrowed funds.

Perfectly sensible.
8690 2018-11-10 20:27:05 Ain’t it funny how the use of palm oil has been an issue for years and now, one advert and all of a sudden everybody thinks they know everything about it lol
8691 2018-11-10 20:26:53 My mom texted me saying one of our cats got hurt and might need to be put down.. but she says “don’t worry. I gave him a bunch of cbd oil so he’s super high and can’t feel the pain”

Ok mom
8692 2018-11-10 20:26:50 One of my fave food shows atm. Love how she’s excited to taste and eat everything. Her curiosity made the show for me. Also seeing olive oil being made...
8693 2018-11-10 20:26:43 Henny taste like motor oil
8694 2018-11-10 20:26:37 @AJA_Cortes DO you fry your eggs? If so? In, what kind of oil/fat?
8695 2018-11-10 20:26:35 He’ll transfer...there’s not enough snake oil in the world you could sell me to sit the bench another year as a 4
8696 2018-11-10 20:26:27 حسبنا الله ونعم الوكيل.
8697 2018-11-10 20:26:26 @cryzsquad this is what I was talking about when I said I don't use products with palm oil
8698 2018-11-10 20:26:26 ありましたなぁ………
8699 2018-11-10 20:26:23 Reagan could have helped prevent or reduce these disasters, but no, the oil money was too important.
8700 2018-11-10 20:26:14 You do understand that companies hedged production when oil was above 70 to obviously protect themselves from the volatility of seasonality.  If you believe that prices are going lower, then by all means stay on the sidelines. I'm long.
8701 2018-11-10 20:26:12 Omg it’s all fucking oil/energy companies  besides going off the grid and replacing your car with a bike or a horse and carriage, we literally are screwed 
8702 2018-11-10 20:25:58 Anybody question the quantity output....where does this oil come from
Toxic fish....toxins are stored in fat
Oh brother
8703 2018-11-10 20:25:52 Obviously those in the palm oil and food industry were not tipped the wink . They were tipped with something else I fear. Disgusting to ban it as it is educational not political.
8704 2018-11-10 20:25:47 Nah, lobbyists working for the oil extraction industry. Car makers wouldn't care how its fueled once they've sold the car.
8705 2018-11-10 20:25:41 Thank God I learned how to put oil in my car, for all 3.
8706 2018-11-10 20:25:40 Ralph, you are 100% right. This nonsense makes the rest of us look like snake oil salesmen.
8707 2018-11-10 20:25:39 Can a ghost oil up?
8708 2018-11-10 20:25:34 Recently got some lavender oil so I put some in my diffuser.  
8709 2018-11-10 20:25:22 Why is it every time I’m supposed to be getting a $50 oil change it ends up being $100 
8710 2018-11-10 20:25:09 I hate being an adult. Getting an oil change and air filter replacement  #idontknowwhatsgoingon #tryingtoactlikeiknowwhattheyaretalkingabout
8711 2018-11-10 20:25:08 $amrn is going to tank Monday.  Mineral oil question is big per @adamfeuerstein
8712 2018-11-10 20:25:03 A clay face mask followed by Argan oil 
8713 2018-11-10 20:24:55 I didn't even know about the palm oil. Thanks @IcelandFoods for bringing this to our attention. It's such an simple change Not buying #PalmOil products or bi-products.
8714 2018-11-10 20:24:31 Wao so much for informed youth. U do not have to stick to ur point if u r wrong. U r totally 100%wrong i ve lived there for years my husband has worked for the top oil industry in the world. Pakistani labour is in worst conditions.
8715 2018-11-10 20:24:29 Well the biggest palm oil company is Wilmar, their biggest share holding company is archer Daniels, the company who invests the most in them in vanguard. So find an mp linked to vanguard and that’s the link. Googling away......
8716 2018-11-10 20:24:15 my hair was like that at one point, deep condition olive oil treatments help! Heat protections syrups before straighten and trim the dead ends so your hair will grow. i tried not to use heat on it for awhile also anything over 350 kills hair . My hair is healthy now try it girl
8717 2018-11-10 20:24:09 Well he should have. They’re the cheating fuckers with no fans and plenty of oil wells. #FFP
8718 2018-11-10 20:24:09 Hell nah never again lol, I’m working for a company called oil states energy they are just like flare but bigger and pay way better.
8719 2018-11-10 20:24:07 nothing smells better than the ogx argan oil bullshit
8720 2018-11-10 20:23:51 Makeup remover is a scam tbh. Also use coconut oil as an undereye night cream 
8721 2018-11-10 20:23:29 Yhu know yhu know. .....toomuch OIL
8722 2018-11-10 20:23:16 Olive oil with parmesan
8723 2018-11-10 20:23:04 Oh wasn't that more to do with black ops wanting to fuck them up because oil was so cheap there they had to destabilise the country & they did!!! next argument
8724 2018-11-10 20:22:56 Still applicable, but first, grind steel and oil the blade.
8725 2018-11-10 20:22:52 Wow. Y’all need some oil, and we can grab that from the kitchen.
8726 2018-11-10 20:22:47 How stupid!! They should have compared their oil to fish oil in one arm and water in another
8727 2018-11-10 20:22:40 P95 – Filters at least 95% of airborne particles. Strongly resistant to oil.

8730 2018-11-10 20:22:24 Put some oil in the oven to heat up for me roasties. Opened the oven and got a face full of the smoke. Me yes are burning to fuck man 
8731 2018-11-10 20:22:03 Use head and shoulders sachets only..  Clean it and use. Clinic all clear anti dandruff oil.  Small bottle
8732 2018-11-10 20:21:59 Trump and Republicans have been anti-climate science as far as I can remember. They pass legislation that favors oil companies/fossil fuels that warm our planet which increases natural disasters like #CaliforniaWildfires. We need more coal! 
8733 2018-11-10 20:21:49 Well we were talking about western heavy oil and the Keystone XL pipeline which has absolutely nothing to do with anything other than western canada so lets try and stay on topic here.
8734 2018-11-10 20:21:45 I wish wish wish that England would give Scotland independence, and then see how long it takes for you to come crawling back! Where would your money come from, the depleted oil and gas stocks?
8735 2018-11-10 20:21:20 Won't it just. He'll be up to his eyes in baby oil now.
8736 2018-11-10 20:21:14 Jamaican Castor Oil thank me later
8737 2018-11-10 20:21:12 .@marksandspencer where does the palm oil in your liquorice allsorts come from? And is it sustainably sourced?
8738 2018-11-10 20:21:05 The Iceland commercial indirectly criticises some of the top TV advertisers that also happen to use palm oil: Unilever, Proctor & Gamble, Nestle.
8739 2018-11-10 20:21:05 The U-Haul Rental Van would arrive at 1804 & Deliver opened boxes etc to her UPS theft costs a lot of money to the consumer
Gone are private pkgs from family, CBD oil for Whiplash, Coats, Jewelry & Family Photos That's just my order. I guessed that they were the LasVegas Shooters
8740 2018-11-10 20:20:57 These are all oil paintins

8741 2018-11-10 20:20:54 Ran out of makeup remover so I used coconut oil.....my life has been changed
8742 2018-11-10 20:20:53 Looks lovely, do you have a recipe? Guessing it uses oil as a dairy substitute?
8743 2018-11-10 20:20:45 Might not be that cynical as they have stopped using products with palm oil, not sure the Twitterarty use Iceland 
8744 2018-11-10 20:20:40 Some people say CBD oil has been helpful for anxiety.
8745 2018-11-10 20:20:38 White flower oil, CBD, hot water bottle, Rusty Nails. As for other, that’s happening anyway.
8746 2018-11-10 20:20:37 If we weren't supposed to eat babies, why the baby oil?
8747 2018-11-10 20:20:33 isnt olive oil something you cook with or maybe, just maybe put on salad for some weird reason?
8748 2018-11-10 20:20:21 Spags n yam cooked together wit g.but oil, chaii
8749 2018-11-10 20:20:19 Okay, technically langue d’oc is not yet a dead language but it’s getting there. Langue d’öil is the one that won overall though. It’s what you think of when you think of French. 

“Oïl” and “oc” are both words for “yes,” by the way.

8752 2018-11-10 20:19:48 I think the Ad is great and its a shame it has been censored. Tell me this, some people argue that palm oil produces the most amount of food oil compared to other available oils like  rapeseed, sunflower etc oils which is why it is used by the food industry is that true?
8753 2018-11-10 20:19:31 Enjoy your blood oil.

8756 2018-11-10 20:18:52 By late 2014 Nigeria was on well on the path of a recession. Look at GDP growth data: 

Q3 2014: 6.23%
Q4: 5.93%
Q1 2015: 3.96%
Q2 2015: 2.35%

With halving of oil prices in 2014, and absence of a savings buffer for the ‘rainy day’, the economy was doomed well before May 29, 2015
8757 2018-11-10 20:18:49 Met her already InshaAllah
8758 2018-11-10 20:18:44 Absolute rubbish. This should be about saving a beautiful animal that is at real risk of extinction due to palm oil. Well done for being another group of people with a hidden agenda hell bent on wrecking the planet.
8759 2018-11-10 20:18:34 Je vous rappelle

8761 2018-11-10 20:18:19 1. anyone looked into effect of mineral oil on lipid profile? - animal studies out there?  brings into question true efficacy of vascepa. $AMRN any previous trials (with other drugs) where mineral oil was used as a placebo? If so... CV/lipid profile effects?
8762 2018-11-10 20:18:16 Dear Dr @JZarif Please ignore their posts, but take actions, for instance on sanctions we should cut off selling oil, so America would feel the pain at the gas pumps, please don’t sell to the 8 countries, let them pay for their sanctions, please. @SecPompeo
8763 2018-11-10 20:18:14 How do you know it’s “winter” in LA? When your coconut oil turns solid, of course. Time to get out the sweaters. #Seasonschange #LAproblems #coconutoil #winteriscoming #LosAngeles
8764 2018-11-10 20:18:12 I wish that in Auckland we could speed up the move to electric vehicles, pedestrian only streets, reduction of speed limits all to reduce our huge cost of imported oil. To encourage our  big tourist and education sector in the CBD
8765 2018-11-10 20:18:12 too bad big oil and global warming is killing all the fish.
8766 2018-11-10 20:18:08 I'm happy to see the dreadful waste that is the burning of fossil fuels stopped as soon as possible.  Coal, gas and oil are valuable chemical resources that have far better used than being burnt.  I don't agree that co2 is a problem but I do agree that we should end ff burning.

8769 2018-11-10 20:17:38 Yes there will always be a discount for poorer grades like our heavy is US wants our cheaper oil to fill domestic needs while it exports its higher grades at world prices. We would add value by adding any new markets other than the mid west the most saturated market in NA.

8773 2018-11-10 20:17:17 I wonder what I would have spent the last 4 years doing if my original plans when I moved here had worked out. Probably not asking questions like "Why is Genie Oil Troubleshooting North Korea?" It didn't feel like it 4 years ago, but maybe everything DOES happen for a reason.
8774 2018-11-10 20:17:13 You definitely aren’t allowed to especially crossing into Canada but I brought like 1/2 oz of oil to NYC & they didn’t say anything hahahahaha I know lots of people who have never gotten in trouble for it
8775 2018-11-10 20:16:53 In this economy i used petrol, battery, water n oil to get to them. So phinde ngibaphathele something futhihaowa

Get caught early and boiled in oil like curly fries
8777 2018-11-10 20:16:44 Get in there Iceland. We need too boycott this palm oil!!!!
8778 2018-11-10 20:16:44 so what's preventing fish oil companies from coming up with something similar, ie, only epa, without dha?
8779 2018-11-10 20:16:43 This is fear mongering. His snake oil is that Trudeau is soft on crime, wants open borders, denies gun rights, won’t protect Canadian (read white) citizens.

This is disinformation meant to terrify people into voting CPC to save themselves and their family from rampant crime.
8780 2018-11-10 20:16:37 Grilling it don’t pull out all the oil. I boil them then put it on the grill ... I rarely eat hotdogs to begin with
8781 2018-11-10 20:16:34 Imran Khan had criticized PMLN government for not lowering prices when oil had gotten cheaper in international market. Petrol prices were reduced from 107 high to their lowest of 62.77. 
Oil price now has come down from a high of 76 dollar a barrel to 60 dollars. #Primeminister

8783 2018-11-10 20:16:17 @kenjilopezalt have you ever tried saving chopped garlic in oil? If yes, was the quality on par with fresh after it was refrigerated for days or frozen for weeks?

8785 2018-11-10 20:16:09 Lol,that's because "they ran out". I have an open mind and ears willing to hear. Answer me this then,where did they get the oil that they originally had?
8786 2018-11-10 20:16:09 oil soluble so are recommended for oilier skin type. It’s salicylic acid. AHAs are water soluble and can help moisturize so it’s good for dry skin. I’m asian so I personally like asian skin care over western. But cosrx has a great bha toner and an aha toner. They have one that’s
8787 2018-11-10 20:16:05 They are doing what we call in the industry, Oil spill recovery and remediation. Would you prefer the hydrocarbon washing into streams and contaminating drinking water? If we really want to stop this, let's improve our emergency response systems.
8788 2018-11-10 20:16:04 I hate getting a oil change cuz you be here all day  and I’m hungry

8791 2018-11-10 20:15:34 Palm oil intake still should be reduced to our best, I fully agree that non-vegans quitting palm oil for deforestation is fucked and stupid, but I still think palm oil industry is destructive and shouldn't be supported.

8793 2018-11-10 20:15:33 Looked at some figures for Iran. Trump's sanctions cannot last forever. Iran has a population of 80 million. 8 cities with a population of >1 million - it is geographically at the center of Eurasia.

Iran is not just about oil like many GCC nations.
8794 2018-11-10 20:15:30 Oh ok I’ve never had issues with it. & your skin be looking popping so I thought you’d use some sort of natural oil
8795 2018-11-10 20:15:21 Vegetable oil.
Onion.
Carrot
Green beans
Green pepper.
8796 2018-11-10 20:15:19 Liar. You love using #bloodoil and pretending you are virtuous by hating Alberta’s Gay friendly oil. You love oil made musical instruments & iPhones which are made with #bloodoil. If you were true to your religion you would walk everywhere and stop using oil products.
8797 2018-11-10 20:15:17 Oil prices have a hit a low of $60 per barrel. Let’s see how quickly this government reacts and lowers prices.
 #Primeminster
8798 2018-11-10 20:15:16 Maybe Californians should pass a fire prevention tax to deal with this. It happens all the time and will keep happening. Seems like a problem the state should address
8799 2018-11-10 20:15:03 What isn't well understood is that this process is just beginning. Digital technologies like blockchain, AI, automation etc are just taking hold in the oil patch as producer trim costs. Labour productivity will rise, # of jobs will fall and those that remain will be different.

8805 2018-11-10 20:14:23 Okay we are going in circles. Then the NDP doesn’t support our industries as many of them were at anti oil protests. Thats how guilt by association works I guess

8808 2018-11-10 20:14:12 let see, you exempted 8 countries to begin with (including India), China says these sanctions are illegal and won't respect it, E.U says they will continue to trade with Iran and Russia says not only will not respect the sanctions but also they will help Iran to sell its oil.

8819 2018-11-10 20:13:29 That is our main export now and that is where the majority of our problem lies. No one is drilling for oil anymore in Canada I havent for over 2 years now its all gas.
8820 2018-11-10 20:13:29 It’s a brush fire not a forest fire moronic #FakePresident. But spray tan facilities, gun stores, oil rigs, hotels with tax evasion seminars, and golf courses would really stop these brutal brushfires from even starting. Then again, it’s likely the #fakemedia starting the fires!
8821 2018-11-10 20:13:25 Are they banning all goods from other manufacturers that contain palm oil? I doubt they are.

8830 2018-11-10 20:12:40 Apparently Elizabeth May caught wind of my thought of us having to take the cost of the Suncor oil sands clean up since it is a huge disaster that is out of control with oil advocates greedy at the troughs of cash payouts. SAD.
8831 2018-11-10 20:12:38 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
8832 2018-11-10 20:12:30 US refineries don't have to refine our oil just because they'll suddenly have access to it thru a pipe.

There is a glut in the US of easier to reach, easier to produce, lighter oil. 

The pipeline will NOT add any significant value. It will continue to trade at a discount.

8837 2018-11-10 20:11:36 However, I have checked many of your recommendations and most of them fell steeply. In my view, there is little chance that oil and gas producers will benefit as they are hedged at low prices. If they are free to make new hedges, prices are down again.

8842 2018-11-10 20:10:56 Better still build a wall around youself and depend 100 % food, clothes,oil, gas. Pay off the debt you owe to other countries. See how long your country would exist . Let see the results if all the countries in the world withdrew from you

8858 2018-11-10 20:09:45 What are YOU talking about? 

Are you really trying to have a conversation based ONLY on heavy oil?

That's not all there is out there, which has been my point from the start. Heavy refining capacity isn't the only problem. 

Bitumen doesn't exist on it's own in a vacuum.

8860 2018-11-10 20:09:39 Yes, it carries an important message, but isn’t really connected to Christmas or the brand. It should be broadcast, but I understand that it was banned for political reasons? Great that they’re boycotting products with palm oil though.
8861 2018-11-10 20:09:36 Yeah, it's an inventory problem more than anything. I think it'll end up being something simple like olive oil, toasted garlic, and parmesan.

8878 2018-11-10 20:07:10 Yes! We should be campaigning for ethical, sustainable palm oil instead of a total boycott. If palm oil wasn’t grown in these regions they wouldn’t let nature regrow, they would use the land for another crop. Maybe a reduction in processed foods would also help!

8912 2018-11-10 20:03:17 Now, when the refinery caught fire, and subsidiary and price control was introduced to manage oil importers maintaining minimum price as a temporary solution till nnpc is able to meet nigerian demand back. But some pple use subsidy as way of enriching themselves, and
8913 2018-11-10 20:02:48 Hmm all these are fair contenders but have you considered.....olive oil?
8914 2018-11-10 20:02:30 Hahaha.. nice one  In the UK, USA and Africa they sell anointing oil, water and handkerchiefs in church for healing and prosperity. It's a business now mate. Everywhere
8915 2018-11-10 20:02:28 I'ts not rice! It's pizza sallad (cabbage, oil, vinegar and stuff) 
8916 2018-11-10 20:02:26 Fifty shades of Brandon Gray makes it 6-3. ’s to Flanny and DeHaas.
8917 2018-11-10 20:02:22 On a side note Nutella contains palm oil. It’s in more food items than we realise.
8918 2018-11-10 20:02:12 I'm using 1/2 dropper twice a day of CBD oil 5000mg. Really really helps.
8919 2018-11-10 20:02:10 Have you an arsenal of medical stuff? Like Olbas oil and calpol?
8920 2018-11-10 20:02:09 Put baby oil on my elbows and knees and the stuff ended up on everything but my skin 
8921 2018-11-10 20:02:07 oil paint has an annoying entry cost, but the materials last forever once you buy them. I'm still using the same tubes of paint from 2 years ago
8922 2018-11-10 20:02:00 Oil they ur head blood
8923 2018-11-10 20:01:58 Should be entertaining to say the least....Jimmy and the young kids is oil and water
8924 2018-11-10 20:01:58 Change my oil too lmfao
8925 2018-11-10 20:01:54 You know the fun part about silent car. If people talk outside you can hear it. Kids were always amazed and you could hear them. Wow that's a Tesla, the battle is over for oil. Those kids want nothing but EV and they will grow up to a world with EV. It's a different world now.
8926 2018-11-10 20:01:48 Absolutely not olive oil wtf
8927 2018-11-10 20:01:34 We will have the oil flowing at Lightz owt 
8928 2018-11-10 20:01:27 Businesses do good for the planet and businesses do bad on the planet. If Business are allowed to advertise political messages then how do you decide 'good' or 'bad'. A oil company for example could campaign against a tax with a fear campaign to protect their bottom line.
8929 2018-11-10 20:01:27 Going to agree to differ. V3 is they never took flasks of oil with them like the wise did, so no wonder they ran out, sleeping or not.
8930 2018-11-10 20:01:26 currency is the engine oil of the economy. if it didn't exist, you'd likely have to invent something very similar. you'd also run into balance of payments issues, and not be able to import anything.

8932 2018-11-10 20:01:10 Check: Greenpeace ad taken over by Iceland; not a Xmas ad; not banned for content but cos one organisation can’t pass off another’s as their own; great PR job by Iceland.
Iceland have eliminated palm oil from their products. Excellent!
So, share away, but not cos it’s “banned”
8933 2018-11-10 20:01:06 While oil has plummeted, energy stocks have managed to break free from the typical trend, noted Erin Gibbs, a portfolio manager at S&P Advisory Services.
8934 2018-11-10 20:00:57 I don’t know if it is because i am turning 30 but i just got my third hole pierced... random thing to do to get ear piercings while waiting for your oil change on your car 
8935 2018-11-10 20:00:48 at a guess id say olive oil
8936 2018-11-10 20:00:39 Seen people hyping up a girl cause she did her oil change LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO man where tf my hype at
8937 2018-11-10 20:00:32 The government does waste a lot of money but Dubai still got more they got that oil money
8938 2018-11-10 20:00:18 i got a new bottle of cbd oil and it pained me so bad to see how expensive this shit is fjdkkdkddk if it didn’t work so well i’d be so bitter
8939 2018-11-10 20:00:15 Are we assuming that was the reason he went?  He went to get his orders from putin. His orders are to get in Iraq. Then Venezuela. It's about oil and real estate. Oh and Ivanka getting 16 trademarks in China.
8940 2018-11-10 20:00:14 Ahhh....he’s back in it, to win it LOL 
8941 2018-11-10 20:00:12 Why do we have to use palm oil? What were we using before it was introduced?
8942 2018-11-10 20:00:08 Palm oil vegans 
8943 2018-11-10 19:59:53 I think it needs engine oil 
8944 2018-11-10 19:59:39 Boil yuca until tender.  Heat the oil in small saucepan over very low heat. Stir in the crushed garlic. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. Mix in parsley, salt and pepper. You are welcome!
8945 2018-11-10 19:59:32 Use vitamin e and coconut oil! I also braid it when it’s damp and it absorbs it all in
8946 2018-11-10 19:59:31 Highly recommend @mrjamesob new book  ‘How to be right’ on  @audibleuk it works so well as an audio book given the context of dismantling people through oracy. Desperately depressing but uplifting at the same time. Balance of anger with the buyers of snake oil and the sellers.
8947 2018-11-10 19:59:30 Oil
8948 2018-11-10 19:59:28 Fantastic advert I never even heard of palm oil so keep it up !! I shall be more aware def !!
8949 2018-11-10 19:59:22 @chriskresser Do you see any issues as a zero carber keto carnivore, taking krill oil? I read your fish oil guide and wondered if you have any updated recommendations!
Thnx :)
8950 2018-11-10 19:59:14 We see this play out all across the country every day. The Broward Sheriff still there sneering at everyone daring them to try and remove him. 
Where was Rick and Pam before now?
8951 2018-11-10 19:59:01 That's why I do what i do.

I did it at BB. No tankers.

Now....I do it at #HorseHill #UKOG #DOR #ALBA .

I give you the pics of copious amounts of Tankers full of Petroleum Crude Oil leaving the site gates on their way to BP at Hamble. 

Gusher!!

8952 2018-11-10 19:58:37 Bolsonaro is a mediocre ignorant in almost everything. Brazil already has US$ Trillions in Oil and US$Trillions in metals being explored.  And  giving away with no added value. Brazil does not need deforestation of indigenous areas
8953 2018-11-10 19:58:30 Damn no more palm oil for me
8954 2018-11-10 19:58:18 Hey Rick, sorry for the silence. I busted the computer and it went for a grease and oil. Thanks for the head's up, I will check this bloke out.
8955 2018-11-10 19:58:13 I get so flustered and nervous when delta sonic has me pull my car into the garage for an oil change

8957 2018-11-10 19:58:02 Many companies produce oil and gas, very often associated. When liquid prices fall, companies have less cash to drill and natgas production falls as well, especially when natural gas liquid prices are falling through the floor as they do now.
8958 2018-11-10 19:57:54 I grew up in Borneo and have witnessed the landscape change. Mature, lush and diverse rainforests full of wonderful wildlife replaced by huge swathes of palm oil plantations, it is so sad to be able to see it disappear too... not in generations, but right now. This is so urgent
8959 2018-11-10 19:57:53 My Migraines were out of control. My Neurologist wanted me to take narcotics to control brain (seizures). Side effects caused me to stop meds. Now I take CBD oil twice a day and chiropractor adjustments once a week. Migraines under control and living life.
8960 2018-11-10 19:57:52 I was going to get an oil change & I have to get full synthetic which is like $100 and expensive AF so I was like I’m just gonna have to do the basic one I’m sorry and the guy was like I’ll charge you for the regular but I’m gonna put full synthetic in for you I almost cried
8961 2018-11-10 19:57:35 Pull up to get my oil change and dude tells other dude “50% off she gets a Hero discount”  (everybody needs a Hero)
8962 2018-11-10 19:57:32 Pulling up lists of brands that use sustainable sources of palm oil, looking into home composting, trying to batch bake snacks and finding ways to reduce the plastic packing that covers almost EVERYTHING we buy.
8963 2018-11-10 19:57:31 Crude oil ended Friday with its 10th straight session of losses, a losing streak not seen in more than 34 years. Those losses have pushed it deeper into a bear market, having plunged nearly 22 percent from its 52-week high.
8964 2018-11-10 19:57:30 Funny he has to clarify at the end that the donation will go " to the Abrams campaign". This guy is a turd sandwich in a suit.
8965 2018-11-10 19:57:20 The powers that banned are mostly likely making money from Palm oil they should be ashamed of themselves
8966 2018-11-10 19:57:18 The demand the economics simply arent there or oil companies would do it without asking for tax payers money.
8967 2018-11-10 19:57:14 Sitting at the dealership, getting car oil changed, when a sales person walks up and asks if I wanna look at cars. NO.
8968 2018-11-10 19:57:11 Me and @Lauraodactyl are palm oil free if you didn’t know
8969 2018-11-10 19:57:09 @MBuhari destroyed yet prior to this administration @OfficialPDPNig ran 30 States of the federation into bankrupt, they borrowed 473bn to pay salaries also left debt profile of $63bn,prior this administration @OfficialPDPNig  sold crude oil @$130 per barrel.

8972 2018-11-10 19:56:38 My dad can’t even use a oil pen... idk how he works in construction.. he called my mom from Minnesota just so she can explain how it works
8973 2018-11-10 19:56:30 I remember chocolate manufacturers using this source of palm oil. They finally stopped using it from the forest areas. My ongoing fear is we simply ‘do not know’ most of the time where our produce comes from. And that includes the rest, not only palm oil!
8974 2018-11-10 19:56:29 Nice! Crushed, raw garlic in olive oil?
8975 2018-11-10 19:56:29 At this point I don’t think anyone underestimates how incompetent/senile he is, even the MAGA goons at the vipers who want him to bring back whale oil or whatever
8976 2018-11-10 19:56:28 IRAQ OIL MIN GHADBAN SAYS FAIR OIL PRICE ABOVE $70/BBL; SAYS HIGHER PRICES BETTER FOR IRAQ: K24. #OOTT
8977 2018-11-10 19:56:23 Handouts are never the answer. Breeds the wrong attitudes and expectations. Besides, where is all the money for BI coming from when you’re idiotically removing oil and gas - 20% of our GDP - from the equation? Have you got a rich uncle, maybe?
8978 2018-11-10 19:55:58 Some of their own brand products do still contain palm oil. Presumably they’ve set themselves a target to cut it out at some stage but not yet :-(
8979 2018-11-10 19:55:30 There is no desire by any private company to build new refineries it is a huge commitment taking roughly 20 to 25 years to reach break even point. No oil company is willing to invest that much in the Canadian energy industry anymore and we do not have the population to support
8980 2018-11-10 19:55:29 He ate paint chips
8981 2018-11-10 19:55:28 Funny that the large oil companies have acknowledged man made climate change for decades after they conducted their own research into it.

8984 2018-11-10 19:55:16 They are called the oil sands and your comment underscores how clueless many of you are.
8985 2018-11-10 19:55:11 Lol why do I even allow myself the moment to pause and think happily about getting money? The world hears me everytime without fail and decides something expensive needs to go wrong. Bursary? Broken laptop time. First pay day from work? Oil leak. Fuck off
8986 2018-11-10 19:55:07 Brilliant work by .@mellydollred finding the many women who performed "Carol Lane" for Shell Oil Company. #DHCS2018
8987 2018-11-10 19:54:40 Germany. Minister of the Environment wants to increase the price of gasoline and  heating oil. In order to maintain the promise of climate protection, Svenja Schulze (SPD) is planning a special tax on gasoline and heating  oil. This can raise the price of fuel to two euros / 1L.
8988 2018-11-10 19:54:33 What an oil slick
8989 2018-11-10 19:54:25 @KELLOGG.UK
Iceland have banned Palm Oil in their products thereby protecting the forests and ultimately the planet. When are Kelloggs going to follow their example
8990 2018-11-10 19:54:20 Well, shes been there several years after doing things that should have gotten her fired or sent to prison maybe. 
So who's responsible for that?
8991 2018-11-10 19:54:16 So baths and coconut oil can stop mange!!! Good to know.
8992 2018-11-10 19:54:14 Toxic sand? You are clueless and ignorant with a comment like that. The left is loathe to admit that oil pays for all the social largesse in this country. Smart move attacking Cdn Oil as we still import oil from shitholes - NOT!
8993 2018-11-10 19:54:14 The phone thing is the biggest issue. I had to use an app called off time to block the crap that would distract me. Shower, lotion, tea, lavender oil. I need to get back into it tho.

8998 2018-11-10 19:54:02 Will you have a mandate to devolve oil revenues for Scotland?
8999 2018-11-10 19:53:58 Get rid of the rainforest for palm oil is like my country would do
9000 2018-11-10 19:53:31 Keyword, (we're going out)vs. 5 makes it clear,while the bridegroom tarried, they all SLUMBERED and SLEPT causing them to run out of that oil they ONCE had.

But that's not the point
Iceland's getting jillions of impressions/RTs for free, for their ad campaign
If you want to support orang-utans & the loss of their habitat due to palm oil, please do so ! - with charities, not corp ad campaigns
Pls
9005 2018-11-10 19:52:58 An 700B per day from oil democrats will punish Saudi's how?
9006 2018-11-10 19:52:57 Man made materials used in car seats and interior of vehicles, oil in engines, and fuel combust wildly in super heated fires that have plenty of dry woods to burn with.  If tree bark pitch burns quick but there is plenty of green wood in the tree, it won't burn so easily.
9007 2018-11-10 19:52:45 It's not a good advert. I know palm oil comes from Africa too. This advert doesn't explain why African palm oil can't be used.
9008 2018-11-10 19:52:34 A valiant promoted tweet but I suspect people hate the concept of a brand proposition less than they hate oil companies.
9009 2018-11-10 19:52:32 Saka murikuwrira cooking oil what’s wrong with you people are you not tired of nhamo
9010 2018-11-10 19:52:31 Wait, The Union does NOT support the reduction in the consumption of Petroleum & NGas, reductions in  production including offshore drilling, NGass #Fracking? You're advocating for the oil and NGas industry vs long-term environment gains for your grandchildren benefit? Trumpsters
9011 2018-11-10 19:52:22 I absolutely want green energy competition of the free market but I see it being blocked. I want it to be cheaper. And we can't do that if we don't invest in it instead of the constant drill and spill of oil production.
9012 2018-11-10 19:52:18 Sometimes you people seems to forget the top players in this team are all over 30. First you have to find the young talent then you have to compete with the oil money then hope he develop. Further more if you are Barca they hustle you. If it was so ez Griezman would be in Barca.
9013 2018-11-10 19:52:10 @FairQuestions next. Vivian Krause on Keystone XL judgment in Montana and 800k barrels of foreign oil imported to Canada daily in absence of Energy East
9014 2018-11-10 19:52:06 The people that don't believe in climate change are amazing. Also even if CO2 didn't contribute to it, why do they want us to keep drilling for a fossil fuel we're going to run out of? There isn't an endless supply of oil, there's a reason why we call fossil fuels fossil fuels.
9015 2018-11-10 19:52:04 Oil prices, on the verge of breaking another resistance? Oh yeahhh, keep it low 
9016 2018-11-10 19:51:57 Looks like that oil needed to be changed anyway.  What a goober, I bet they didn't get very far.
9017 2018-11-10 19:51:54 $56 for a fucking oil change and tire rotation goodness gracious
9018 2018-11-10 19:51:42 30 minutes before my wife and her friend are due to go out to the cinema my son walks into kitchen with silly putty stuck in his hair! 4 year old now in bed without cutting his hair. Conditioner, baby oil and a nit comb with lots of tears!!
9019 2018-11-10 19:51:16 No be so @atiku is the only contestant that has proven that he can manage resources. He was a VP for 8 yrs, in which 3 of it was strictly to witch hunt him & send him to jail @Donald_Duke also served as an executive gov of a rich oil state at same period @atiku has proven himself

9022 2018-11-10 19:51:01 I can listen to that. I think that it's suspect that we don't create policies that push for green energy competition with oil & carbon prod, but let's hash out a way to make it competitive. We have smart up and coming kids that can do better for us all. Let's encourage it.
9023 2018-11-10 19:50:20 Collect ingredients .. dil mustard, french, english, nut oil, olive oil, balsamic vin, honey, mayonaise, thousand island dressing, sugar, salt, blue cheese.

You can with these make endless dressings
9024 2018-11-10 19:49:51 Obsessed with how good my hair smells  moroccan oil is loveeee
9025 2018-11-10 19:49:49 Oil Drilling? 
9026 2018-11-10 19:49:43 I hope Iceland fair better with the Palm oil campaign than they in 2000....The supermarket chain Iceland raised the stakes in the store wars by announcing it is to switch its entire own brand frozen vegetable range to organic - at no extra cost to the consumer. They lost sales!
9027 2018-11-10 19:49:34 @bakewithstork Please can you tell me if the palm oil in your product is from a sustainable source? Many thanks.
9028 2018-11-10 19:49:28 I don’t drink sodas, but if I did it wouldn’t be Coca Cola, I can’t fathom drinking shit that looks like motor oil
9029 2018-11-10 19:49:18 Kelloggs have you seen Icelands ad. They have taken the very responsible step to ban Palm Oil in order to save the forests and therefore save the planet. Can Kelloggs do the right thing and follow Icelands example
9030 2018-11-10 19:49:13 Hahaha gotta love this! 

Also, it takes a special kind of idiot to think that 6% unemployment rate - alongside the highest labour force participation rate by a mile - is a disaster. 

Outside of the oil industry, AB is recovering very, very well.
9031 2018-11-10 19:49:12 These liberal Socialist judges are destroying this country with insane rulings and restrictions about things that they know nothing about.This
brian morris knows nothing about the oil business. These no nothing judges have to be controlled some
way. They cost this country jobs
9032 2018-11-10 19:49:09 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
9033 2018-11-10 19:49:04 Favorite t-shirt seen at #seagl2018 : If data is the new oil, I’m an environmentalist
9034 2018-11-10 19:48:43 I need to get a oil change
9035 2018-11-10 19:48:35 Iceland, Uruguay and Paraguay seem to manage just fine. To hell with the Saudis and their psychotic leaders, we need to create British renewable energy for domestic use. End this crazy austerity. Use national oil subsidies to invest in solar, wind and hydroelectricity:
9036 2018-11-10 19:48:27 I would prefer a hybrid any day. Only electric is just plane .... Electric for daily commute. Carbon reduction is necessary for everyone's future in world. Even for kids of oil companies.
9037 2018-11-10 19:48:23 Without oil money your club will play in lower league.
9038 2018-11-10 19:48:20 I’m going to pm you about cbd oil and nursing
9039 2018-11-10 19:48:07 Unfortunately the only way this will stop is if the demand stops. Supermarkets and producers should, by law, have to stamp all of their products showing it contains palm oil in very big letters, so consumers are not blind sided.
9040 2018-11-10 19:48:02 Just to tell us the price of fuel, red oil, rice , dollars & pounds in 2015 & of today ur running around,even the toothpick ur  claming to be manufacturing by buhari is no way to be seen, what's the price  of the toothpick in 2015 and what's the price today? Buhari is a faliure
9041 2018-11-10 19:47:47 Plus, Russia has found another workaround which is the barter system, exchanging of different oil.  I wouldn't be surprised if many other countries start following suit.  That way they are not in violation of the AOFAC.

9047 2018-11-10 19:46:53 Palm oil should be banned, not the advert. It’s use is totally unnecessary. When orang-utans and other species are wiped out because of it we’ll all be stood there saying it should never have been allowed to happen when we could’ve done something to prevent it.

9078 2018-11-10 19:43:37 that ban was a gift...but there is a danger that far right groups follow this template: get banned => go viral.  But with this case, if it leads to pressure in palm oil then it would be a great outcome.

9081 2018-11-10 19:43:20 Thanks for the context. I know about Mossadegh but didn’t connect the oil-gas reference. That WAS his unforgivable sin, wasn’t it - he thought Iran should profit a little from their own oil.  He got over that nutty notion though didn’t he lol.

9087 2018-11-10 19:42:32 @IcelandFoods Well done Iceland for withdrawing palm oil from your own brand protects to protect forests & endangered species. We shopped in one of your stores today & will always support brave & ethical retailers with our business. Your 'banned' Christmas advert is amazing!
9088 2018-11-10 19:42:32 Nevertheless, America EU Asia and Africa continue to work with murderers! Lobbyists and politicians fill their pockets with dirty oil dollars with bloody hands?
9089 2018-11-10 19:42:31 It does seem these fires creeping into some of these areas could be reduced by clearing fuels.
I doubt these people are actually living on federal lands. Maybe change building codes for more fire restiant housing. Metal roofs, masonry, sprinkler systems?

9119 2018-11-10 19:38:46 I thought palm oil was a euphemism.

9125 2018-11-10 19:37:43 1/ I may not have been clear in my tweet. My annoyance is that it got banned for being 'too political'. Obviously the palm oil issue goes way beyond an ad. And, clearly, this is a good move for Iceland. But the point they make in the ad is still valid & their stance is good
9126 2018-11-10 19:37:42 After Saudis barbaric act in killing a US based journalist and lying about it no one can feel safe with the Saudis getting nuclear power. I use the same logic which was used for Iran: why do Saudis need nuclear power if they have so much oil? Don't forget 9/11
9127 2018-11-10 19:37:37 @Clearcast your decision to ban the Iceland Ad is disgraceful, wholly unjustified as nobody would argue that palm oil is damaging habitats. You're banning an Ad for conveying the TRUTH, when many others are full of misleading copy. Your decision is political, not the Ad!
9128 2018-11-10 19:37:34 Yeah it is a difficult but in reality everyone needs to know what is actually happening a lot of people have no idea about the palm oil problem and how it affects and destroys so many ecosystems

9138 2018-11-10 19:36:49 Completely agree! It is a WONDERFULLY conceived and produced advert which rightly shows why Iceland have been removing palm oil from their products. #SaveTheOrangutan

9149 2018-11-10 19:36:00 Only last month a Greenpeace investigation found that Kellogg’s are still buying their palm oil from companies that destroy rainforests and kill orangutans. The report said that palm oil traders Wilmar were responsible for more rainforest destruction than any other, and (1/2)

> did not smell like oil, was very white
> dude drove 1/2 mile before pulling over
> engine still running

what could this be?

9164 2018-11-10 19:35:12 I did. Thanks. I’m an environmentalist by trade, and have long supported #WWF and #Greenpeace in their campaigns around palm oil. It’s a challenging subject in many respects. Keep up the good work.
9165 2018-11-10 19:35:11 Oh crap. I put a few drops of peppermint oil in body lotion and rub it in. Might help

9185 2018-11-10 19:33:07 2018 achievement: Actually ate yam, palm oil sauce & kpomo without staining my white sleeves. 

That's flawless 
9186 2018-11-10 19:33:06 I love what your doing with palm oil, however I'm concerned about the soya in your products & if it's sustainable.  The soya Industry is incredibly destructive to rain forest
9187 2018-11-10 19:33:04 if you gon take care of that bih and treat it right its gon last but you know how girls is bout changing oil and stuff. 
9188 2018-11-10 19:32:59 I know right? Olive oil bread!! 
9189 2018-11-10 19:32:54 This narcissist is pandering his political views using this fire and peoples suffering. We all know he is pushing to reduce our national forests and has proposed to strip the endangered species  act to allow oil, gas drilling and loggjng in our forests.
9190 2018-11-10 19:32:54 I need an oil change who got me
9191 2018-11-10 19:32:50 let him or you prove it.
9192 2018-11-10 19:32:38 @Tweet4nita Hey Anita! Did you try CBD Oil because of your tics? My friend also had the same tics sincee birth. CBD Oil helped him so much. Bye
9193 2018-11-10 19:32:18 My car is riding so smooth again I can’t even be mad it cost me $80 for this damn oil change
9194 2018-11-10 19:32:04 4-3 Oilers after 2.
9195 2018-11-10 19:32:02 It is equal parts coconut oil and epsom salt—super easy!
9196 2018-11-10 19:31:59 How about save lives.. or improve living condition.. price of oil now that’s a lofty goal
9197 2018-11-10 19:31:37 So I prefer oil based paints over water ... especially when applying textures . Only thing is that phrase “watching paint dry” ugh  takes forever lol .
9198 2018-11-10 19:31:20 I've never wanted to be oil so much in my life as I do right now!
9199 2018-11-10 19:31:17 My oil diffuser came (‘:
9200 2018-11-10 19:31:17 Baby oil doesn't disappoint 
9201 2018-11-10 19:31:15 i always smell like incense and some essential oil right now it's peppermint
9202 2018-11-10 19:31:06 Have you tried cbd oil, I’m trying it out for pain and anxiety
9203 2018-11-10 19:31:05 $37.5 BILLION a year to big oil. Obama tried to stop this but GOP Congress refused. Look at farm subsidies, also huge. Trump just gave farmers $12 BILLION as a bailout due to his tariffs. Now farmers want MORE! Keep up. GOP in bed with corporations & paid by lobbyists.
9204 2018-11-10 19:31:04 Spent my morning changing my oil. Just for the battery to die  What a Saturday maaaaannn
9205 2018-11-10 19:30:56 Oh, heavily in bed with oil industry. I’ll take that as a reason to turn your back on your grandchildren’s right to an inhabitable planet.
9206 2018-11-10 19:30:55 Care for our orangutan brothers and sisters starts with not destroying their homes. No to deforestation, No to palm oil!
9207 2018-11-10 19:30:50 tea tree oil is truly THE essential oil
9208 2018-11-10 19:30:26 It's like banning an ad discouraging viewers from smoking because it's detrimental to their lungs. Eating, applying to your skin or hair, palm oil consumption is detrimental to your Indonesian rainforest. Whether you are left, right, nazi or jew, the detriment is the same.
9209 2018-11-10 19:30:20 Yuca/taro! Boil it until tender then mix it with olive oil and garlic 
9210 2018-11-10 19:30:06 honestly? it’s probably because the government agrees that poaching is bad but very large companies (that pay a lot of tax and have a lot of power) continue to use palm oil. sad but that’s the way our world works right now.
9211 2018-11-10 19:30:00 “As much as the environmental activists decry oil and gas contributing to global warming, the reality is that the US has done more than any other country when it comes to reducing emissions.” -George Sharpe, Investment Manager, Merrion Oil & Gas
9212 2018-11-10 19:29:58 Free gas fill-ups for their automobiles, free propane and heating oil tank refills would also be great to provide our vets on Veterans Day.
9213 2018-11-10 19:29:48 It’s kind of a waiting game whenever you’re getting your oil changed, to see whether they come back spilling bad news about your car or not lol.
9214 2018-11-10 19:29:47 Of course PMB has destroyed the economy of fake import of oil for subsidy payment, full payment for contracts to be abandoned; ghost workers, and government monies put in your type of bank to be yielding interests for individuals; and importation of everything,toothpicks also!
9215 2018-11-10 19:29:46 SpyHunter mode: with oil slicks, smoke clouds, and missile launcher
9216 2018-11-10 19:29:43 Would it be too cynical to imagine that Iceland knew that their palm oil advert would get canned but had a reasonable chance of going viral on the back of the outrage?
9217 2018-11-10 19:29:42 There have been a couple commercial products that emitted scents, and even a standard for scents on web pages. Sadly, it was a crappy standard - the hardware heated vials of oil, and the oil setup wasn't standardized. Standard just said 'use oil #3'.
9218 2018-11-10 19:29:37 Some orange juice brands contain fish oil. Tropicana has a hearth "healthy" OK that has this. 
9219 2018-11-10 19:29:35 No real sanctions were put on Abacha - U.S still needed our oil and the Nigerian Army for peacekeeping operations in Sierra Leone and Liberia.
9220 2018-11-10 19:29:32 Trying castor oil...
9221 2018-11-10 19:29:20 Russian VTB, a state-owned bank, funded a significant portion of the Qatar Investment Authority’s acquisition of a stake in oil giant Rosneft, Reuters reports, quoting nine unnamed sources familiar with the deal...
9222 2018-11-10 19:29:05 Sorry!  We have a black list of items we don’t buy too. More people need to boycott anything with palm oil.
9223 2018-11-10 19:29:05 COULD IT BE THAT GOV SCOTT IS A CROOKED POLITICIAN?? HE'S UNDER PRESIDENT BONE SPURS WING.  HOW MUCH DIRTY OIL MONEY DO U HAVE IN UR BANK ACCT GIVEN TO U FROM RUSSIA?  U ALL SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED.
9224 2018-11-10 19:28:57 Thank you @realDonaldTrump @POTUS giving the American people a savings. Since he tweeted he didn’t like the high oil prices it has gone down. Putting millions back into the pockets of the American people. wish the @federalreserve would listen to him! Helping big banks  
9225 2018-11-10 19:28:53 Supporting orangutan habitat deforestation by using palm oil is not ‘supporting anyone’.
9226 2018-11-10 19:28:46 A house in Firestone Colorado exploded because of an uncapped abandoned gas well. 2 people died. Oil spill in Colorado that ran into a property's water source - 50 cattle dead, land must be remediated. Still waiting a year later for oil company to pay for it. How's that?
9227 2018-11-10 19:28:16 how the fuck do you use oil pastels
9228 2018-11-10 19:27:39 Literally I was talking to my mate about this earlier, I wish they were all cruelty free and palm oil free!
9229 2018-11-10 19:27:34 @Thedude67111 I'm loving your "description"! I bet no one gets it. The Midnight Oil reference.
9230 2018-11-10 19:27:34 They are anything but green, contain aprox 100 gallons of oil that must be changed regularly, on 20 foot deep concrete bases that leech lime into the soil, they catch fire and are left to burn out spilling hot oil on the ground, etc etc etc
9231 2018-11-10 19:27:34 Actually, I do this roaster salad thing.  Carrots, onions, potatoes, squash, and beats in a dish with vinegar and oil.  Roast that shit for like an hour, then top with goat cheese and herbs.
9232 2018-11-10 19:27:23 He'll have the coconut oil out two handing Gabe if that happens.
9233 2018-11-10 19:27:11 I am in the pacific northwest. I grew up in a logging community.
A big gripe is the people who live in cities making rules about forests while very rarely visiting one.

Also it is a well known fact that public land burns way more than private land right ?
9234 2018-11-10 19:27:05 Put some Coconut oil and they should fall out
9235 2018-11-10 19:27:02 there is a thing where we dunk freshly fried schnitzels (straight out of the oil) in boiling water and then pat them dry, and they stay crispy, but this is,, ???
9236 2018-11-10 19:26:58 That’s a dead link. Do you have any policy for palm oil? Do you use it?
9237 2018-11-10 19:26:55 Should I release this stat sheet I made for Thumped detailing his abilities and shit?
9238 2018-11-10 19:26:44 Shaq
9239 2018-11-10 19:26:40 Did the Colorado oil industry ballot measure pass?
9240 2018-11-10 19:26:27 I put tee tree oil on my eye lid and now I’m crying...
9241 2018-11-10 19:26:25 I can arrange an oil barrel round the back of Smithfield Market. 

Still the same, yeah?
9242 2018-11-10 19:26:18 I remember studying whole night under oil lamp during power failure before my exams....in 90s.... Didn't even have emergency lamp those days!
9243 2018-11-10 19:26:13 I’ve been using the cdb oil that @jaimelawson08 sells and can honestly say it works for me. Instead of rolling out of bed in agony am up and out like a young (ish) thing and pain free  cheers Jamie 
9244 2018-11-10 19:26:11 this was such an eye opener i didnt realise that deforestation occurs so we can make palm oil and they’re in everyday items like shampoo ect, i’m gonna make sure to read the ingredients before i buy stuff now #NoPalmOilChristmas
9245 2018-11-10 19:26:08 #SkincareSaturday: Another tip for supermodel undereyes many don’t know - a gentle physical exfoliating (*gentle*, not gangster) w/your ring finger and a microfine scrub or a lil sugar, honey & grape seed or almond oil. Concealer will be FLAWLESS!
9246 2018-11-10 19:26:07 Oil companies have murdered America
9247 2018-11-10 19:25:32 Literally music blasting ....freshly showered....oiled up with almond oil.....oh my god this is gold
9248 2018-11-10 19:25:29 Stop buying Palm Oil  People forget trees give us oxygen and nature was here before humans
9249 2018-11-10 19:25:22 so hypersexualised and sexist ads can be aired on tv but informative advertisements that talk about the adverse effects of palm oil on orangutans is "too political" to be aired????????  wtf
9250 2018-11-10 19:25:14 I think "craft reptile oil" sounds better.
9251 2018-11-10 19:25:11 When is our party going to take over Oil City area with casinos in the vacant malls? This will transform the region to all Democratic as it will ceat jobs,and boost the motel industry #PAVotesBlue
9252 2018-11-10 19:25:04 Assuming all existing economic policy remains unchanged, minimal oil revenue, and trident? 
And assuming continued membership of EU?
9253 2018-11-10 19:25:03 This happens over and over again. Greater concentrations of people and lack of prevention measures are not irrelevant. Maybe not a timely message considering the loss and suffering but the state needs to address it if they want to keep packing more ppl in.
9254 2018-11-10 19:24:48 Oil prices are reviewed on monthly basis they will be reviewed at the end of the month BTW how much USD appreciated any idea oil prices are pegged with Ruppee dollar parity don’t look at it in isolation
9255 2018-11-10 19:24:47 We aren't addicted to #oil, but our #cars are. - James Woolsey
9256 2018-11-10 19:24:22 Halloumi, love it. I'll grill it as a snack, drizzle with olive oil and some black pepper. For a quick appetizer, cook some tiny onions with balsamic until soft. Grill some halloumi and skewer the onions, cheese and drizzle with evoo, s/p.
9257 2018-11-10 19:24:09 I already have salt and palm oil
9258 2018-11-10 19:24:02 Lol I just heard a coworker say "you'll go home smelling like gun oil" and I laughed and said "been there before." Then I realized they meant ACTUAL gun oil, not lube.
9259 2018-11-10 19:23:59 v 3 is very clear that they took no oil with them. The flasks of it I presume.
v 9 said their lamps were going out. They would have had oil already in them I presume when they set out, but they didnt take any spare oil.
There isnt a clash between the two verses.
9260 2018-11-10 19:23:57 We should be transporting oil to our own markets as well!!! We should not be importing foreign oil when we have a ton of our own! Build pipelines!!!
9261 2018-11-10 19:23:55 the price of oil retraced b/c of U.S./Saudi over supply. Cheap price means Iran unable to finance its terrorism. Brilliant economic warfare and we get cheaper fuel. Are you sure youre a lawyer, you dont sound smart enough to be a lawyer.
9262 2018-11-10 19:23:49 I hope that every single person that shares the Iceland advert a) start checking the food they buy for palm oil and b) maybe think about the impact EATING ACTUAL ANIMALS DOES
9263 2018-11-10 19:23:42 At! Unite all and strength comes. independent Scotland unite with Scots have militia protect oil.
9264 2018-11-10 19:23:41 ANYway when is someone going to paint an oil portrait of me at my prime since im young and youth is fleeting and also i want a portrait
9265 2018-11-10 19:23:06 I don’t wear cologne I wear body oil
9266 2018-11-10 19:22:47 Best wishes.  Love you all.  Have a great show! Can't wait to see you on Lucas Oil Field!

9272 2018-11-10 19:22:35 @achrisevans Hi Chris Evans, my mate James thinks his going bald. So... we need to know the oil you mentioned on your show? Love baldy!
9273 2018-11-10 19:22:33 -don't touch your face
-wash your face during the day
- itch your face with your knuckles
- find your type of skin (ex. oily, dry)
-use moisturizer 
-do not pop pimples
-try not to eat dairy as much 
- use vitamin E oil and aloe vera gel to fade scars
9274 2018-11-10 19:22:33 Changed my oil, off to the casino soon. Let's do this whole Birthday thing.
9275 2018-11-10 19:22:21 Cadbury have just about removed themselves from the NZ chocolate market.
1, Abortive attempt using palm oil instead of cocoa butter
2, closing down Dunedin Chocolate factory,
3, Kingside bars are now flat and thin, different mold.
4, All confectionery now made in Aussie or other
9276 2018-11-10 19:22:09 Tx. Is the palm oil sustainable? Lots of ingredients.
9277 2018-11-10 19:22:08 Looks like it might rain and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
9278 2018-11-10 19:22:07 Exactly.. That's what Baba should be doing with all the money he keeps borrowing from other nations. Invest in Nigeria and then we'll see it grow. But Baba and his cohorts are using hunger to make us all look stupid. Like how do u explain sharing onions and oil to win votes...
9279 2018-11-10 19:22:06 True, without oil all middle eastern countries are junk, will be trashed by the west in no time.
9280 2018-11-10 19:22:04 Trim and cook for around 1 minute, or sunseed oil in a lightly with the pan over the pan in a splash of the burgers and toast
9281 2018-11-10 19:22:03 Please read all of my other tweets on this, including the insustainability of palm oil substitutes, the human rights abuses of certified sustainable palm oil production, and the original aim of the Greenpeace campaign.
9282 2018-11-10 19:21:53 'Growth Commission chair Andrew Wilson on how to invest North Sea oil cash' - is this is a pisstake?

9284 2018-11-10 19:21:44 Interesting decision to ban the advertisement. But if people don’t use palm oil, what should They use instead? There is no simple answer on a planet with so many people all wanting so much
9285 2018-11-10 19:21:36 I play at a very relaxed pace. Oil is never an issue tbh.

9292 2018-11-10 19:20:33 I need more coconut oil...
9293 2018-11-10 19:20:29 It will shift jobs away from stagnation in the oil & gas sector, which will increase productivity and innovation and lead to new businesses forming.

9295 2018-11-10 19:20:17 @Mr4thAndLong dude you can’t knock firecrackers if you haven’t had them. It’s more than just crackers oil and pepper... you have to ad the ranch powder mix and bake them. I wouldn’t make that the only thing for a pot luck, but they are a damn good snack.
9296 2018-11-10 19:20:17 Off to do some Shagging soon ! I have a very old lady on the boil, I need to oil her up and jump in #TopShagger
9297 2018-11-10 19:20:10 Oh, wow. Mine haven’t leaked, but they all grossly separated in the tube. It looks like oil and pigment marbling. Lol. And no amount of shaking the tube helps! But when they were new they had extremely good staying power on me personally. At least their prices are cheap, I guess.
9298 2018-11-10 19:19:49 Or just farm commissions i got 10k+ oil that way

9301 2018-11-10 19:19:26 HR 4239 is back on the House agenda. It will open up the land & coasts to oil drilling & other environmental stupidity. No wonder Lindsey Graham wants Scott to join the Senate before he's actually official. Don't let this happen. #FloridaRecount
9302 2018-11-10 19:19:20 I'm on no alcohol just cannabis oil
9303 2018-11-10 19:19:15 Never said they were environmentally friendly, it’s 1 step at a time. They have removed palm oil products, and told the world. 

When we introduce paper straws @PureZante, we can’t tweet about it? Because we still use plastic cups?
9304 2018-11-10 19:19:13 It’s already a greenpeace ad and it’s amazing!!!! - they’ve just stopped Iceland airing it because they only ‘plan’ on being palm oil free so it’s against advertising standards as it’s claiming something that’s not their current sitch for £ probs x
9305 2018-11-10 19:19:02 I've just given it a big hug.

9307 2018-11-10 19:18:56 We have our own North Sea gas and oil! Why are we buying it from your poisonous  pals in Russia? Since the 1970s we should, with Norway have the cheapest energy bills in the E.U. Oh it’s probably because you Tory’s privatised it and it’s owned by the fucking Germans now!
9308 2018-11-10 19:18:52 you would rather have concrete and oil fields just so you and the 1% can make more money. I suspect that you have never seen the wondrous outdoors.
9309 2018-11-10 19:18:41 Castor oil @thenaturalshub
9310 2018-11-10 19:18:35 Proud heritage Scot we have suffered No more being subjects of anyone and that goes for Westminister. We keep the oil we don't beg for a vote .e
We vote Cut them off heard about  threats cutting off Retirements of old. Wee  stupid on their part.we Scots.   oil. Guard it. Militia
9311 2018-11-10 19:18:31 No you dont understand most of our oil is going to a saturated market and there is a glut if we had the ability to gain access to Houston refineries that are running under capacity and built to refine heavier crude than ours we would be able to alleviate glut and increase value.
9312 2018-11-10 19:18:30 He could also go to Halfords for a longer  dipstick when the old one stops reaching the oil.
9313 2018-11-10 19:18:25 "To bite or not to bite, that is the question. Oooooo, salty palm oil!"
9314 2018-11-10 19:18:21 Camirus and rose oil, in caves in the body of silver in warm to that size, and Aleria founded by a white hellebore is so
9315 2018-11-10 19:18:18 The ad is simple yet powerful. Banning it has only made people want to see it more. And if just a handful of people change their shopping habits and ditch palm oil its a small victory. Thankyou @IcelandFoods for showing the way forward
9316 2018-11-10 19:18:18 Oil change. Cheeeeck 
9317 2018-11-10 19:18:14 Time to ask for  free storage and or free oil changes.

9325 2018-11-10 19:17:34 HAHAHA. I will stop by, I just got an oil change in Cleveland Heights so I’m like five minutes away
9326 2018-11-10 19:17:16 I haven’t changed my oil in about 9 months... I’m such a dipstick.
9327 2018-11-10 19:16:48 Oil isnt a health food. its refined fat. Healthy plant fats are infinitely better in nutritional and mineral quality. Obviously having it in really small amounts or just on occasion wont cause any damage, but it isn't a health promoting food. at best its health neutral.
9328 2018-11-10 19:16:36 I must say so for someone new to the beard gang, your beard is pretty epic already!!! Just some quick advice, keep it clean and use beard oil. It will literally change and take your beard game to a whole new level.

9330 2018-11-10 19:16:26 Oil in the South China Sea behind under communist jurisdiction also a key part of it. And yes domino effect but petropolitics are always key in determining involvement from US. Fair point about demonstrations though. Makes sense.
9331 2018-11-10 19:16:26 Your tax $s at work. Yet again, misspent $. Wake up Floridians and don't allow this shyster, Snipes, to continue to sell you snake oil!
9332 2018-11-10 19:16:24 @Tesco following on from @IcelandFoods lead, it would be really useful if you could highlight which products do and do not contain palm oil, even make a start on cosmetics/shampoo etc
9333 2018-11-10 19:16:11 Just looking at my shampoo and all my cosmetics for palm oil. Won’t be buying them again.
9334 2018-11-10 19:15:50 By the looks of things the rest of us will just drown in palm oil for our sins

9337 2018-11-10 19:15:27 So why did his government buy a pipeline from the private sector to ship crude oil to China through the Rockies? Both the Premier of BC and the Governor of Washington State are against it. Big carbon footprint, using carbon tax money.

9352 2018-11-10 19:13:57 Sir,
My concern is purely due to the obvious and evident political bias that is presented at 9news. Many in the oil and gas industry feel this, as I pointed out in this post. (Not meant in any comedy or satire way as most memes are) My point is clear; get rid of your liberal bias
9353 2018-11-10 19:13:55 The US must decide who their friends are, Europe or the middle East countries, between punishing Russia or Iran. Europe needs oil and gas.
9354 2018-11-10 19:13:51 I for one am so grateful for Iceland’s advert, and their incredible stand against using palm oil (not to mention their fight on plastic). I know where I will be shopping this Christmas.  bravo @IcelandFoods
9355 2018-11-10 19:13:47 Oil change people always want you to get something extra. Give me my oil so I can go broke in an actual store. Thx 
9356 2018-11-10 19:13:17 They’re not saying that they’re not, they’re saying they’ve taken palm oil products off their shelves, hence the video. 
9357 2018-11-10 19:13:13 Very. It’s insanely versatile, as is palm kernel oil (fantastic replacement for cocoa butter). But only about 20% of it is sustainable.

9366 2018-11-10 19:12:09 we cooking again today and the bar later  meanwhile sis bonding with Ley and me poopie gettting an oil change
9367 2018-11-10 19:12:05 Iceland educating people about palm oil will hurt the shareholders of companies that use palm oil. Shareholders are a protected species.
9368 2018-11-10 19:11:56 How about getting Canada’s oil to international markets to have a positive effect on global climate change.
9369 2018-11-10 19:11:37 100% agreed- this advert is trying to help make people aware of the destruction caused by palm oil. It makes me incredibly happy seeing people protesting this banned advert and getting it seen because it deserves to be seen thank you for sharing it
9370 2018-11-10 19:11:32 What category of food is oil under again?
9371 2018-11-10 19:11:28 Sliding backwards into a view I had when I believed in imminant peak oil. That view is that progress socially, culturally however you want to define it only holds in a surplus phase.

9375 2018-11-10 19:11:07 I didnt say low fat diets were healthier or necessary. Low fat wfpb diets are the ONLY diets that have clinically reversed heart disease, ever, in human history. For people with heart disease consuming oil can be lethal. Whole food plant fats are infinitely healthier than oils.
9376 2018-11-10 19:10:46 But you forgot that Hunger, poverty, and unemployment were caused by pdp via looting our resources without saving a dime. Despite the huge revenue generated till we borrow money to paid salaries, when they were enjoying oil boom sell at $120 per barrel.

9382 2018-11-10 19:10:18 @Scavino45 @Scaramucci @realDonaldTrump The only reason the budget sequester with spending cuts was gradually eradicated was due to controlling the debt ceiling by increasing taxes, repeal of some oil subsidy loopholes, cutting farm subsidies, and increasing flood insurance.

9390 2018-11-10 19:09:40 Apparently for giving a "political message". Just seems like fact to me... Good on @IcelandFoods for raising awareness of the issue and taking palm oil out of their products I say!
9391 2018-11-10 19:09:23 The ruling oligarchy receives huge tax cuts while the people are channeled into rage and contempt at the shenanigans of a celebrity snake oil salesperson, and clamor for more exaggerated Russian conspiracy theories. #ResistOligarchy #Peace

9398 2018-11-10 19:09:02 No. the Mediterranean diet is an outdated heart disease treatment replaced by the DASH diet. The DASH diet is a plant based diet with minimal oil and minimal low fat dairy and little to no meat. It aims to capture the benefits of a whole food plant based diet (the optimal) (1/2)
9399 2018-11-10 19:08:54 the Iceland advert was banned because the capitalist system cares more about profit from palm oil than the ethics in its use. they banned it because they dont want you to understand whats happening

Remove your potatoes and give each 3-4 slits with a knife. When sizzly, give your potatoes 10 mins to get coated in the oil and butter. Roast for 40mins

9424 2018-11-10 19:05:55 Well done for highlighting the appalling destruction of the Orangutan’s habitat for palm oil production. It might have been banned from TV but the publicity you’re getting by them banning it will be remembered for years to come. If only more Corporate Co’s had your morals
9425 2018-11-10 19:05:44 if you actually look at the data, all peoples consuming oils have raising LDL regardless of oil. Some oils are better than others yes, but my point is, having a continuously raising LDL at any rate will eventually be lethal.

9451 2018-11-10 19:03:25 Iceland has become the first major UK supermarket to remove palm oil from all its own-brand products. Of course they are going to promote their own brand alongside greenpeace , they are making a difference they are not being malicious and money driven

9459 2018-11-10 19:02:40 Oil is a volatile commodity it shrinks a grows in volume and value according to #unionist whim
9460 2018-11-10 19:02:28 #RT @RealTimeWWII: New York Times: Earthquake in "Nazi-dominated Romania proves 'General Fate' is supporting Britain & Greece- the Axis war machine may run dry of oil."
9461 2018-11-10 19:02:25 i sure hope that turbo isn't blown. its spitting quite a bit of oil ...
9462 2018-11-10 19:02:25 I just thought lotion and oil helped, so idk
9463 2018-11-10 19:02:16 You're not setting the record straight regarding your own views, either. Do you think oil workers should be treated differently than other North Dakotans? If the GOP tried to treat oil workers differently, isn't that shameful conduct?
9464 2018-11-10 19:02:15 And massively raised awareness to the catastrophic devastation palm oil causes.
9465 2018-11-10 19:02:04 It's called oil.
9466 2018-11-10 19:02:03 @LidlUK Could you please say where can I find a list of ingredients of your bakery products? Or which ones do not contain palm oil?
9467 2018-11-10 19:01:53 Hmm, let me guess who is banning it! Palm oil executives and people who get money from such! #banbusinesspoliticsnow
9468 2018-11-10 19:01:46 А в чём прикол фанфикс ми? Тупо же фикбук, только людей меньше...
9469 2018-11-10 19:01:45 Are there really inhuman fools that can do that kuwa!!!!??
9470 2018-11-10 19:01:44 so Wawa gave me extra oil and vinegar in the cups and I get to work and eat it and all of it is in the bag 
9471 2018-11-10 19:01:40 Deci que el gas oil no está caro
9472 2018-11-10 19:01:34 I added the orange icing for effect . Olive oil is better than butter. Can't substitute the olive oil as it would no longer be an olive oil cake. 
9473 2018-11-10 19:01:13 The Israeli Zionazi's illegally stole, occupied the Golan Heights of Syria under the guise of self-defense and refuse to return it which breaks multiple International laws, Geneva Conventions, Treaty's and UN Resolutions. Water, Oil, resources for free further makes it a flashpt.
9474 2018-11-10 19:01:08 My favorite leisure food currently consists of toasted sourdough dipped in olive oil and all the parmesan
9475 2018-11-10 19:01:08 If SNP was in power in an Indy Scotland when we struck oil,, things would be so different now.Being in UK Union has screwed  us big time!

9477 2018-11-10 19:01:04 It wouldnt surprise me if brown envelopes crossed hands as CEOs and people in top 1% got a bit nervous that thier Palm Oil cash cow could come to an end. Well Done @IcelandFoods Shame on you @ASA_UK
9478 2018-11-10 19:01:01 :D If you feel like it, try kale toasted in an oven sprinkled with olive oil. Then, put some salt on it.
9479 2018-11-10 19:00:43 Just throw away all your oil and cry and wait
9480 2018-11-10 19:00:40 New York Times: Earthquake in "Nazi-dominated Romania proves 'General Fate' is supporting Britain & Greece- the Axis war machine may run dry of oil." #WW2
9481 2018-11-10 19:00:37 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
9482 2018-11-10 19:00:33 if aliens came to earth and where willing to show us a new source of clean renewable energy the united states would go to war with them so the oil industry doesn’t go under
9483 2018-11-10 19:00:33 So cigarettes and oil
9484 2018-11-10 19:00:30 My true opposition to the project is nativist--the Canadian oil transported via Keystone will undercut American origin oil, lowering market value.  When market price falls, American oil workers are laid off.  A difference of just $0.25 can put thousands in the unemployment line.
9485 2018-11-10 19:00:28 Just make stew & ewedu with eba

9488 2018-11-10 18:59:43 It was brilliant it’s shame it can’t be aired on tv and even worse that the palm oil industry is ruining natural habitat having seen the plantations first hand I applaud you for trying to share this travesty
9489 2018-11-10 18:59:39 As we're Ogaden people we're colonized and marginalized we're under military occupation we're like the minimal Russians in Soviet Union we're treating we're the second,

Ethiopian Colonial Regime doesn't need to rise our people but they only need to explore our Gas and Oil

9492 2018-11-10 18:58:59 Correct, I hear they are preparing to get rid of Scotland when the oil runs out....
9493 2018-11-10 18:58:57 Not too Political just too Factual, which is not liked by the  Palm Oil producers!
Destruction of the Orangutan habitat & their inevitable extinction has been on the cards for a long time, but stopping it is still not prioritised enough.... Palm Oil Desimation! Let the add run!
9494 2018-11-10 18:58:55 Was that the one time we fought Russia in person? I honestly forget but that would make sense why you’re happy about that ending and not the ones where brown babies are being blown to bits by the guys who sell us oil.
9495 2018-11-10 18:58:51 You can try to remove the snake with vegetable oil, if it is still alive. That’s all I’ve got.
9496 2018-11-10 18:58:51 You know, it’s not exactly changing your own oil, but filling up your tires with air is pretty badass. You’re talkin’ to a Badass right now.
9497 2018-11-10 18:58:50 Last Sat AM, the folks at 2230 E Bell @autozone turned away my used oil and suggested I go to @oreillyauto around the corner. So I did. I spent $50 on filters at O’Reilly while I was there. I’m still baffled by this.
9498 2018-11-10 18:58:44 For what it’s worth. I see both sides, but I think the more that the palm oil issue is raised, the better. People are already quite clued up on some of Icelands unsustainable stock issues. This also makes food affordable for some of the poorest in our country. It’s a wide issue
9499 2018-11-10 18:58:39 Dead simple and packed with flavour: heavily reduced sauce of tomatoes, garlic, anchovies, capers, black olives, lots of olive oil and maybe a little dried chilli.
9500 2018-11-10 18:58:26 The reason for fear and resentment in some circles is that Americans, British, French+ others are helping the evil Saudi coalition bomb the hell out of the Middle East. It's true that our own federal politicians are sold out to M.B.S. for oil dolllars. Let's have truth on C.B.C.

9511 2018-11-10 18:57:34 Do you want orangutans to become extinct? If you buy or eat Nutella you are willfully contributing to their extinction. Nutella is one third palm oil. The homes of orangutans are being destroyed for your enjoyment. If you think Nutella is healthy you are pretending. #PalmOil

9528 2018-11-10 18:55:38 Is it true that you do however use palm oil In your products? If so, that is truly disappointing and I wouldn’t be able to buy from you anymore.
9529 2018-11-10 18:55:36 Use a washcloth. Wipe with oil. Then with soap. Wash out towel. Rinse. Air dry. Repeat.

9534 2018-11-10 18:54:45 Says a guy who doesn’t believe in climate change

Is pushing for the Keystone oil pipeline despite the fact that it has leaked into drinking water 

Is trying  to cut funding for the National Park Service.
9535 2018-11-10 18:54:45 If you’re part of a big oil company or any non-renewable energy and you decide not to invest your billions if profits into the future of renewables, then your company deserves to be crushed when the future arrives at your doorstep

9541 2018-11-10 18:54:17 Was stunned by this episode on many levels too! Can imagine this palm oil related forest destruction does nothing good for bee populations / bee diversity out there either!?

9551 2018-11-10 18:53:45 agree w. you about whaling.
also, they were one of the early backers of the oil & gas industry, and are still difficult on that front. Though .... they are at least changing course to more alternatives. A Scandinavian thing, that.
Not to mention the social safety net...
9552 2018-11-10 18:53:42 Let’s hope that people take action and stop buying products with palm oil

9569 2018-11-10 18:52:16 I recall that our strategic oil reserve is essentially a couple of these cleared of salt and filled with oil, right on the gulf coast.  Or maybe nature cleared them of salt?  I can’t get my head around geology.  I respect those who can.
9570 2018-11-10 18:52:14 I saw the Greenpeace video a few months ago.  It did the rounds on social media.  I understand that Iceland asked to use it for their Xmas ad as it supports their stance on palm oil.  Advert doesn't mention Greenpeace.
9571 2018-11-10 18:52:08 @NandosUK phoned my order in at 5.30, at the Speke restaurant; gave my name in at 5.50 & didn't get my food until 6.25; which was only because I re-queued up to ask where it was. Got home, my food was stone cold & there was no peri peri oil for my hummous. Thanks for nothing

9602 2018-11-10 18:49:04 The crude oil price drop is 16%, how much is being passed back to us , until now 6%

Before Karnataka election price was not changed for 15days

Last 2 years the duty has been raised.even when the crude oil is at its lowest of 35 dollar

Bottom line consider the facts
9603 2018-11-10 18:48:57 Sir Oil down is temporary phenomena...earlier we were saying crude will trade below 30dollars then again jumped to 85 odd...this is very big commodity for spectaculars...
9604 2018-11-10 18:48:51 Agreed. Confirms costs with US shale (Permian) and uptick in Rockies and NDakota.  However don’t see uptick in Canada yet (oil sands). Maybe Encana’s Newfield buy signals top of US foreign investment and Shell’s LNG Monterey play (Canada) bottom in EM energy CAPX. USD outflow.
9605 2018-11-10 18:48:35 Why isn’t Twitter showing the video
9606 2018-11-10 18:48:34 Lol right? I'd be out here taking 2 eggs for 2 slices. Maybe they do that thing where you wait for the oil to get suuuper hot then put the beat egg in there, the egg expands real nice.
9607 2018-11-10 18:48:29 starch is absolutely improved by fats/seasonings, no question. It’s just that it’s still tasty on its own, at least in the case of white rice. TBF, I have turned down bread when it is cold and no butter/oil was available.And I always turn down hotdog buns
9608 2018-11-10 18:48:23 why is this oil meme going around
9609 2018-11-10 18:48:20 It happened to me 
9610 2018-11-10 18:48:16 If only we could squeeze the palm oil out of them and turn them into paper our problems would be solved
9611 2018-11-10 18:48:15 This is insanely good! How did they get Dax away from changing the oil in a motorcycle?
9612 2018-11-10 18:48:11 But they didnt take any oil v 3
9613 2018-11-10 18:48:09 Yet we still buy billions in oil!

9621 2018-11-10 18:47:09 #Blizzard is adding more oil to the fire. Announcing that their best developers work on mobile games, implying PC games are lower priority. Sometimes best move is to not do/say anything. I feel this year they should have skipped #Diablo panel at #Blizzcon entirely. #gaming
9622 2018-11-10 18:47:05 Girl  need to find someone else to do your oil change than 
9623 2018-11-10 18:46:47 Whatever. Go drink some fucking oil or something, prick.
9624 2018-11-10 18:46:40 This is so obvious: Ryan Zinke saw devastation and thought exploitation. He’s been wanting to open federal lands to logging, mining, and oil and gas “development” — oh, and hotels? — and this ploy says, “privatization is better, look at what a sh*tty job the government has done.”
9625 2018-11-10 18:46:36 Asad Umar sahab @Asad_Umar plz reduce the oil prices! Its below 60 dollars now. It should atleast go down to 85 in Pakistan too now.
9626 2018-11-10 18:46:32 Dem get crude oil we get palm oil....don't mistake the two sir. 
9627 2018-11-10 18:46:28 I saw people lighting number of oil lamps in house instead of that I suggest just lamp 1 or 2 diyas and try to light lamps in poor people house to make their diwali special.
9628 2018-11-10 18:46:16 Honestly I just slice them think on a mandolin and fry them very lightly in a pan with a tiny bit of oil and some seasoning. They taste way better than steamed.
9629 2018-11-10 18:46:11 They don't bother my eyes, but they are very useful for when I have chronic pain flare-ups and when I don't have energy for my regular sweet almond oil + microfiber cloth duo.
9630 2018-11-10 18:46:01 Also Bush had a lot of oil shares and was in financial trouble because the price of oil was $22 barrel in the autumn of 2002
Iraq war started 20 March 2003
By October 2004 it was $45 barrel
Bush was no longer in financial trouble

9636 2018-11-10 18:45:18 So much revenue generated through taxes on oil and gas yet we never hear from the environmental movement their plans to replace this revenue when they achieve their dream of green energy taking over. Can’t tax the wind and sun, look for massive service/ delivery charges.

9638 2018-11-10 18:45:02 IMO each 1 of the existing Fossil Fuels,Coal,Oil&Gas,are much more costly to Dig, Pump, Frack, or what ever method is used to get them out of the ground,is way more costly to obtain&process than Solar,Wind,Water,Geothermal, Steam..a Cost of Production would easily show this.

9645 2018-11-10 18:44:24 This is so obviously @realDonaldTrump wanting to give #RyanZinke free rein to open federal lands to logging, mining, and oil and gas “development” — oh, and Trump hotels?— by arguing, “privatization is better, look at what a sh*tty job the government has done.”
9646 2018-11-10 18:44:24 If they banned political party broadcasts you would be the first person to accuse the Tories of doing it so other parties cant promote themselves!! also the way we access palm oil is massively dodgy and borderline illegal!

9649 2018-11-10 18:44:18 But not all, that's the point. Dismissing concerns with palm oil because animal ag contributes more to deforestation is a terrible take on the issue. How can you be a vegan and not care about the animals who suffer and die due to palm monocultures planted on deforested lands?

9675 2018-11-10 18:41:35 We support social services. Let’s help those in need. What irritates us is someone who takes public $ they don’t need, taking resources from others.

9678 2018-11-10 18:41:15 How about supporting Canadian energy instead of importing foreign oil?
9679 2018-11-10 18:41:11 What you are describing sounds like what we call “saheena” which I love . We make “callaloo” and “oil down”. The former is stewed leaves with coconut milk . The latter a tricky reduction of the leaves with breadfruit and coconut milk that is cooked all the way down to the oils.
9680 2018-11-10 18:41:10 Got it: #RyanZinke wants to open federal lands to logging, mining, and oil and gas “development” — oh, and #TrumpHotels, maybe? — and this is the ploy that says, “privatization is better, look at what a sh*tty job the government has done.”

9709 2018-11-10 18:38:55 Yep and Democrats sue to get that 20 dollar a barrel oil not to come to the US and import the 80 dollar a oil from the Mid East by getting a Obama judge to stop the Keystone Pipe line from Canada again. You just cant fix stupid even having their kids aborted is not working.

9731 2018-11-10 18:37:23 Listened to a discussion on Iran; the discussants said Iranian leaders feared the build up to the sanctions more than the sanctions themselves, for this simple reason - when the sanctions are on, they'll know who is & who is not buying their oil & can plan accordingly.
9732 2018-11-10 18:37:20 Hot oil is the secret. And red pepper flakes.
9733 2018-11-10 18:37:18 Trump's sanctions against Iran ARE A COMPLETE FAILURE. The price of oil collapsed because will continue to sell its oil with no problems.  This is what happens when you are an assh0Ie that alienates all yor allies.
9734 2018-11-10 18:37:16 There's a very good reason behind that. Russia doesn't give the west money, whereas Saudi Arabia has billions invested in the USA. Where do you think their oil comes from? Corruption makes them untouchable.
9735 2018-11-10 18:37:15 @eThekwiniM good evening guys, some assistance/advise please. I see that somebody is cleaning up and fencing an area next to the church on Zoutpansberg loop in Shallcross and storing used motor oil there. Is this not an environmental danger. Please advise who can be contacted.
9736 2018-11-10 18:37:09 #CBD oil Could Benefit Heart Health
Recent research has linked #CBD with several benefits for the heart and circulatory system, including the ability to lower high blood pressure.
Talk to your doctor before changing stuff. Any other questions ask.
9737 2018-11-10 18:37:02 If you aren't using rosehip oil on your face, you're missing out 
9738 2018-11-10 18:37:01 That's an oil company's graph - it may be right but can't tell the whole story. The rate of change matters here, there are price tipping points that can cause big shifts. But yes - disruptive AF - the more we delay the more disruption.
9739 2018-11-10 18:37:01 Delicately used his nails as he explored my body covered in oil. Spanked me several times even though others can hear. Other theras were like ‘shushhh’ but he kept going.
9740 2018-11-10 18:37:00 We fry patato wedges too in mustard oil. Turns out crisp just likes parwal pieces. Parwal sabzi is the best if cooked in mustard oil
9741 2018-11-10 18:36:59 I had no idea coconut oil could be used as a miticide! What doesn't that stuff do?
 Benji
9742 2018-11-10 18:36:52 Helping to ensure homeless adults and children in my city get some semblance of a happy Christmas as every year; avoiding products with palm oil as always; and not fucking *bleating* about others who are trying to help because it's not "Christmassy" enough. 
9743 2018-11-10 18:36:42 Am I the only person trying to stop eating meal, recycle, stop using single use plastic, reduce my palm oil usage and still failing miserably?!

9745 2018-11-10 18:36:35 My best soup - Onugbu Soup as an Anambra girl that i am.

Ingredient - 
200 onugbu
300 fish
300 Stock fish
100 Canda
150 Ede(cocoyam)
50 Pepper
100 Crayfish 
50 maggi
50 ogiri 
100 oil
100 fufu. 

Note- Don't make use of the whole maggi ooo. If you need the recipe, let me know
9746 2018-11-10 18:36:03 But the  question is ,whether the oil prices in  Saudi Arabia is falling with the same rate comparing it to the international market?
9747 2018-11-10 18:35:55 Yeah I won’t have to drive all the way to arlington to get valve or slide oil anymore
9748 2018-11-10 18:35:55 I can get on board with that but if palm oil could be made accessible without repercussions for the planet then Iceland could use the ingredient again. Vegans are anti meat eating regardless of how good or bad it it brought to the consumer. Its why i got involved. Wrong campaign.
9749 2018-11-10 18:35:54 @IcelandFoods wanna see more from the Rang-Tang campaign - where are the petitions to stop Palm Oil deforestation etc? It’s not enough to share a video, we have to act. #LetsDoMore 
9750 2018-11-10 18:35:53 I wondered if it was federal land. And I wondered how this fellow from a gold and white penthouse in NYC knows all about forests out in the West, other than he wants to cut them down for the timber and sell the land to oil and coal companies.
9751 2018-11-10 18:35:43 Well that is personal preference of course. But on the palm oil issue lush are clearly a step or two ahead of where the body shop should be.
9752 2018-11-10 18:35:40 Vested interests? Like Jared Kushner/Saudi Arabia and Ivanka Trump/China? Ryan Kinke? Rex Tillerson who was actively working an oil deal with Russia? Scott Pruitt? Wilbur Ross?

I don't recall RFK being caught/fired using his office to line his own pockets.
9753 2018-11-10 18:35:34 Rather take this nap over getting an oil change but... adulting

9756 2018-11-10 18:35:23 Question for my vegan friends (or non-vegan friends who cook vegan more often than me) I’m making a vegan chili, and I feel like it needs some fat. Any suggestions? I don’t feel like coconut milk would work flavor-wise. Should I just mix in some olive oil?
9757 2018-11-10 18:35:21 Nothing with the oil itself, but how it’s obtained. The industry has caused a lot of damage to the environment through deforestation. It’s also been linked to human rights violations in indigenous communities, including child labor.
9758 2018-11-10 18:35:15 skincare klevaru sunfloweer seed face oil, preloved baru dua kali pake 25k~ kali aja minat^^
9759 2018-11-10 18:35:15 and yet @POTUS gave nothing and getting some of Putin's oil & gas exports from the EU...oil and gas is all Putin has, with an economy the size of Connecticut, but has massive nuclear desperate for uranium & Obama gave it to him!!! TRAITOR!!!
9760 2018-11-10 18:35:11 In cosmetics, it's a very poor choice.  It produces a drying & gritty soap, and is often subjected to enhanced processing to improve its quality. 

It's a thin watery oil & therefore needs to be thickened in creams etc, often with man made alternatives, thickeners & emusifiers.
9761 2018-11-10 18:35:07 Try roasting the broccoli with olive oil, pepper, chilli flakes, and some soy sauce. I took inspiration from @LividEye and it’s awesome.
9762 2018-11-10 18:35:03 Tried a new oil cleanser today and I’m so mad it’s been sitting in my closet for so long, it’s great.
9763 2018-11-10 18:34:47 It's staggering awful the well known brands that use palm oil !
9764 2018-11-10 18:34:40 Yes exactly! Sustainable is the way to go if you want to help, and I have to say I'm glad that Nutella is on that list. I knew they were a big user of palm oil and had actually stopped buying it. Yay for lazy toast!
9765 2018-11-10 18:34:32 On the other hand, the elimination of palm oil along with accompanying education will help save millions from obesity and its related diseases -  particularly in underdeveloped countries
9766 2018-11-10 18:34:30 Think you need a rub down with johnson & johnson baby oil...he may be a game changer...
9767 2018-11-10 18:34:29 PSA palm oil isn't the only cause deforestation. It's one of many resources ruining the lives of wild animals so while you're thinking about it also keep these in mind:
 Tea/coffee
 Sugar/chocolate 
 livestock
Logging 
Soy beans
#Deforestation #IcelandAdvert #PalmOil
9768 2018-11-10 18:34:28 Oh no is it okay??? Or are you just getting like an oil change
9769 2018-11-10 18:34:14 So how do 'once saved always saved ppl' fall away, then? Think of those without oil - think of those shouting to Yeshua, 'but, I healed in your name, I did this or that', and Yeshua says 'Get away from me, I never knew you'?
9770 2018-11-10 18:34:13 I went regular nuln oil and it worked pretty well. I basically followed Duncan’s 4 part series on painting knights
9771 2018-11-10 18:34:09 What the he'll is this? Why don't you and Rafael Cruz take your act on the road and have tent sermons to sell your snake oil. No place in government for religious bullshit when you cannot comport yourself as a decent human being and Christian.

9775 2018-11-10 18:33:44 Cardinal rule of business is that you evolve or face extinction. They are destined to by the coming new paradigm. Big Oil will eventually be reduced to only plastics feedstock. Cars will be electric, energy will be renewable. This is cheaper and smarter. Reduced cost of climate c
9776 2018-11-10 18:33:39 oh no... i didnt know any of this and i love kit kats so much... ijust checked the ingredients on the bag i have and it does say palm kernel oil

9785 2018-11-10 18:32:33 The most sought after course to study now is data analysis....data is the new oil
9786 2018-11-10 18:32:32 Question! @IcelandFoods or anyone... is there some scientific name for palm oil we should be looking out for? I can't help but think some producers will "disguise" it so people aren't put off buying their products #SaveRangTan 
9787 2018-11-10 18:32:29 There was a fairly large thing recently on twitter bc lobbies stopped an ad with palm oil info from being aired or smth?
9788 2018-11-10 18:32:29 @Jeff_B_Evans @BasRuttenMMA hey guys, part of my regimen this next go around is Receptra, a CBD oil. I’ve been nervous to try it, but my respect for both of you helped make the decision easier. It’s already helping with my appetite and pain some - just wanted to say thanks.

9792 2018-11-10 18:32:12 So instead of allocating Federal Payments to helping the people of your nation, where do you plan on allocating these funds? Drilling more pipelines for cheaper oil? Building the wall? Please tell me what the fuck you think your job is in office because I think you’re confused
9793 2018-11-10 18:32:08 @jiffylube I read online that you all do free oil changes for veterans on vet day. I was excited to see you advertising this for 2018, So I called my location at 801 Lane Allen Rd, Lexington, KY 40504 to inquire about the deal. They told my they they did not offer such a deal.
9794 2018-11-10 18:32:00 I thought it was Oakie dokie, oil my Palm.... And Poplar vote.
9795 2018-11-10 18:31:46 Oh, I see.

So, if/when XL is completed, and we start supplying EVEN MORE heavy oil than we do currently, the price will go UP?  

I don't think you understand basic economic theory.

And how about we build refineries in THIS country, instead of shipping those jobs South?
9796 2018-11-10 18:31:41 True that, my wise friend!! We love good ‘ol DEFORESTATION FREE palm oil as one of the better options!
9797 2018-11-10 18:31:41 Graham saying Dems will “stop at nothing to win” when his party is the one which denies climate change in exchange for oil money/accepts white nationalists as mainstream support/refuses to pass common sense gun laws as people continue to die. Go the f home.

9799 2018-11-10 18:31:11 The problem is that nothing the US can do will have an effect to people in Iran. The country can export food, unlike Saudi and Oman, Iran has crops, industry and export oil through Russia - not a pint to the US!

9802 2018-11-10 18:30:44 It’s clearly an oil painting... 
9803 2018-11-10 18:30:22 i'm starting to wonder the correlation between vitamin and essential oil hunbots and women who voted for Trump.
9804 2018-11-10 18:30:20 No, Tottie, when you scald a finger on boiling oil you run it under the cold tap, not the hot. Promise me you'll buck up, you silly tart!
9805 2018-11-10 18:30:18 The problem with #PalmOil has been around for many years, its even debatable that "sustainable sources" are not reliable. It's use in cosmetics is purley due to cost. Per hectare you get more palm oil than any other vegetable crop.
9806 2018-11-10 18:30:16 It was a good listen, Bilal! Is it out on iTunes as well? I didn’t know the terms of payment were as long as 90 days. Always thought they were 60, but I now learned something new about Iran-India oil relations. Thanks, man!
9807 2018-11-10 18:30:15 chicken soup and oregano oil capsules. esp the oregano oil. Serious medicine. Be well soon!!
9808 2018-11-10 18:30:13 If it tastes like nutella less 97 percent sugar and palm oil then I'd get it from the moon if I had to! Thanks for the heads up :)
9809 2018-11-10 18:30:10 Started to make ethical choices about the food I buy. Palm oil is in cheap foods that give no merit to our health. We're destroying the planet for that.
9810 2018-11-10 18:30:10 Hope u descussed not giving anymore oil rich nations a welfare checks for billions....and the U.S. not taking anymore crap off these countries....oh ya, how about bringing our jobs back home from mexico...they have no respect for our country.Or American's lives

9813 2018-11-10 18:30:00 Scheduled for airing over the Christmas period.
Interestingly, instead of promoting oodles of Christmas grub, they would have made this gesture to highlight a pretty serious situation.
The association with Iceland would be the promotion of their palm oil free, own-brand products.
9814 2018-11-10 18:29:50 It's palm oil o, imagine palm oil in noodles. Ewwww. And it's #400. Lol. Everything about it is nonsense.
9815 2018-11-10 18:29:46 So you are saying the oil and gas companies around the world and people driving cars are what is causing the fires in California? There have been droughts since the beginning of time. Way before vehicles. It happens.
9816 2018-11-10 18:29:33 i got tea tree oil in my eye fuck that shit burns

9819 2018-11-10 18:29:16 Almost all of it in comercial products (including stuff like shampoo) comes from unsustainable harvesting that is both directly and indirectly leading to massive deflorestation, unless I'm thinking of the wrong oil
9820 2018-11-10 18:29:08 If I were to Google "oil company stooge" this would be the first result. You are an embarrassment.
9821 2018-11-10 18:29:05 God made America! Gold, Oil, and Drugs!
9822 2018-11-10 18:28:54 Duke's bread alone is almost worth the trip to the farmers market.  I'm addicted to the garlic oil loaf.
9823 2018-11-10 18:28:45 They will sacrifice everything you own, and even your life, to prove climate change kills people.  Some people haven’t connected the dots yet.  Wake up people!!
9824 2018-11-10 18:28:32 Science : A pimple is formed when excess oil is trapped in your pores.  

Indian Parents: Its because you sleep all day and don’t pray you haywaan
9825 2018-11-10 18:28:20 I appreciate @mrlube for free oil change but am not happy that they wanted me to leave car sitting for 6 hours. Could they not book the car in for this #injured #veteran to return for the service. How am I to get around; mobility? This regular paying customer will not return.
9826 2018-11-10 18:28:15 Yes, many Black people put oil on the forehead and pray before battling racism and discrimination each day. His grandma likely had experiences similar to the Little Rock 9, and knew those same enemies are out still there -- just covert now.
9827 2018-11-10 18:27:55 work, oil change, watch the gurls and try to eat in between that.
9828 2018-11-10 18:27:52 White Rice and red oil
9829 2018-11-10 18:27:51 just when you think he couldn't be even more of an ignorant piece of shit than he already is, he literally evokes absolute NO compassion whatsoever for those affected by the fire. BTW it's called CLIMATE CHANGE but ofc you wouldn't care since you benefit from big oil companies.
9830 2018-11-10 18:27:50 ในหัวมีแต่ดอยอินทนนท์
9831 2018-11-10 18:27:40 I need to go get my oil changed
9832 2018-11-10 18:27:38 my brother just said “if you don’t make it to a good school, you always have OFU. oil field university.” 
9833 2018-11-10 18:27:36 He got some good double d 40 engine oil on his elbow
9834 2018-11-10 18:27:36 Palm oil is destroying our forests, so glad you got this information
9835 2018-11-10 18:27:34 I was just talking about this. Was that palm oil they put in that shit? Even stoners rejected the food.
9836 2018-11-10 18:27:26 Olive oil use kiya kro acha b lage ga or bat b achi ho ge 
9837 2018-11-10 18:27:23 As we pass a large silver container on a truck: Danny: What do you think is in there? Me: I don’t know. Maybe oil. Danny: I think there’s milk in there because we’re in Wisconsin. 
9838 2018-11-10 18:27:05 i have the oil rig and the terrordome in good shape.  the bunker too but a bit in rougher shape. quite a few vehicles in varying shapes. the one based on the Warthog in better than others. and a lot of armaments and figures to put together again
9839 2018-11-10 18:26:57 I'm guessing lobbyists are claiming it will damage business interests. When you look at the use of #PalmOil it's right across product ranges, from food to beauty. Actually quite an inferior oil & is often subject to processing to improve its uses in even more industries.
9840 2018-11-10 18:26:50 Saudi could end the Israeli occupation of Palestine v quickly. It supplies around 34% of the worlds oil, it supplies areound 60% of all oil imported in the US. Stop all oil going to USA until they ask Israel to follow UN resolutions and leave Palestine. USA would be on its knees.
9841 2018-11-10 18:26:26 Easy to say from Newfoundland as you pump oil and sell at world prices.
9842 2018-11-10 18:26:19 Oil is still 1.47!
9843 2018-11-10 18:26:13 Will everyone that is outraged by the decision to ban the advert start reading ingredients and make sure they avoid palm oil though? We have the power to force the change if we do.
9844 2018-11-10 18:25:16 Very sad indeed was quite depressing driving around Sabah seeing Palm Oil plantations everywhere and lots of the forest destroyed in 2016. Did get lucky and see a few wild Orangutang’s along the Kinnabatangan River though as well as Pygmy Elephants.
9845 2018-11-10 18:25:10 Took me an hour to change the oil in two vehicles today. Don’t see me being able to pick up a second job @jiffylube any time soon. #shadetreemechanicwannabe

9851 2018-11-10 18:24:31 You don’t know the first thing about oil. Where does it come from, how does it taste? You’re a fool
9852 2018-11-10 18:24:31 Oil money illegally channelled in is who's behind you.
9853 2018-11-10 18:24:28 For longer hair...

1. Mix one egg, 2 teaspoons of yogurt, 1 teaspoon of olive oil, and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice.

2. Use a cosmetic brush to apply this mask to damp hair and leave this mask in your hair for 30 minutes before rinsing it out.

3. Use this mask once a week
9854 2018-11-10 18:24:28 My oil is ready but my cubes and gold aren't.
9855 2018-11-10 18:24:09 Good dad day.  Taught my youngest son and two of his female class mates how to change disk brakes and the oil.  Skills every kid should have.
9856 2018-11-10 18:24:08 It seems like you are a fan of nothing except Gabe Kapler and presumably coconut oil.
9857 2018-11-10 18:24:07 A talented, socially and environmentally minded young man. After reading your tweet I researched the information of the palm oil controversy.  Thnk u for challenging ur twitter followers to be aware and care about more than their little corner of the world.
9858 2018-11-10 18:24:04 Soo stupid of him
9859 2018-11-10 18:24:01 I am just yet to hear of a way that palm oil can be sustainable. But for your context I stopped eating meat and dairy for environmental reasons so I’m hard to convince otherwise haha
9860 2018-11-10 18:24:00 I went w/ 17 yr old daughter to get her oil change and after we left she asked me...Dad what would cause my car not to accelerate? 

Me: I said try moving you seat up. 

Light turns green and we start moving I asked her...did that help? Yes it did 
9861 2018-11-10 18:23:55 Kitkats use palm oil?! Was looking at the ingredients and I guess I'm never buying them again
9862 2018-11-10 18:23:37 Yes there is, you bloated, saggy Cheeto. It's called climate change...you know that thing that's happening to our planet because we're burning fossil fuels like oil and coal....climatologists warned us decades ago these sorts of things would happen...and they now are.
9863 2018-11-10 18:23:26 Whoa, they can turn MCT oil into noodle-shapes now? Was not aware of that.
9864 2018-11-10 18:23:20 Almonds puts my natural face oil on themselves to moisturizes
9865 2018-11-10 18:23:10 I said “political” because it’s not policy or law, it’s an issue or cause to reduce palm oil use. The ban is obviously ridiculous, but down to vested interests. And Iceland knew that - its all a bit artificial. As you say, it worked!
9866 2018-11-10 18:23:09 I’m 97.363% convinced that any reduction of anxiety directly attributed to CBD oil is a function of a boost to the bank account of whoever is making the claim. 

That said, @TitosVodka has the same effect on me so hook me up with that check!
9867 2018-11-10 18:23:05 ビンタしたのゆまち？
9868 2018-11-10 18:23:05 allow to steam.
-Add Palm oil, allow to boil very well.
-Add your ofor allow to boil and dissolve.
-check the taste, so to add any season required.
-Add your oha/ Uzizza, stir and bring down soup immediately.Serve hot with swallow of your choice. Don't send me the money. BuyPad
9869 2018-11-10 18:23:03 i cant even describe the sensation i get with it but i also get the wanting to move thing it’s so bad u literally cant sleep nd yeah i’ve heard that cbd oil is good for so many things i just cant stand the taste
9870 2018-11-10 18:22:51 The issue with Trump, it seems to me, is not whether he is guilty but rather, how to convince a critical mass of people that his crimes are serious enough to warrant removal. 

Do we need a stock market crash? Some other crisis (Arab Oil Embargo was key to dump Nixon).
9871 2018-11-10 18:22:51 Al-Falih agreed in a meeting in Baghdad earlier Saturday on joint coordination with Iraq to achieve more stability in the oil market, Iraqi Oil Ministry spokesman Asim Jihad said by phone

Excuse me sir.... what the hell did you discuss than..... 
Jeez.... these guys are so vague
9872 2018-11-10 18:22:49 If you are willing to take advice from an amateur lime myself 
I think a lack of baby oil was the problem
9873 2018-11-10 18:22:42 งานวันที่ 24 อยู่ญี่ปุ่นยังไม่กลับเลยจ้า
9874 2018-11-10 18:22:41 Oil Update:: Higher US Oil Rig count maintains bearishness, now trading at $69.6/b. OPEC+(OPEC + Russia) to meet tomorrow, An extension of production cut is on the table, if agreed upon could provide relief to falling oil. India ponders barter of Basmati Rice for Oil with Iran.
9875 2018-11-10 18:22:37 So many wrongs in this nation of ours, safety hazard ignored, they will probably end up selling this dirty oil to mess up someone's fuel pump. High poverty causes this so u really can't blame them
9876 2018-11-10 18:22:33 How on earth are they the same? I like diamonds. I dont like the way the mines destroy the land & use cheap labour. Supermarkets love palm oil. Its a very versatile ingredient used cheaply in many foods. Iceland  however dont like the way the land is destroyed to obtain it.
9877 2018-11-10 18:22:32 @Tesco Just bought a Tesco bagged Indian meal for 2.  Whilst reading the cooking instructions realised it contained palm oil!  PALM OIL???  Why Tesco? Why? From now on going to Iceland instead!
9878 2018-11-10 18:22:31 My woman wanted to take her car to get an oil change at the dealership
9879 2018-11-10 18:22:30 Yea I will never pay for another oil change again 
9880 2018-11-10 18:22:20 Slide some oil to me was a certified banger
9881 2018-11-10 18:22:19 You're Gona have to hold her down lmfao put the oil in a syringe and slide it to the side of her mouth so it can go down quickly LMFAO jk if she refuses just give her mineral water with lime it'll go away, is she up and going?
9882 2018-11-10 18:22:16 Cooking oil.
9883 2018-11-10 18:22:11 i did not know my oil change was gonna be this high 
9884 2018-11-10 18:22:04 @JerryBrownGov I hope along with other Californians Jerry Broen never gives in to you and big oil companies to destroy our largest natural resource   Jerry brown is trying to preserve the forest. You will destroy it. #CaliforniaFires
9885 2018-11-10 18:21:38 Hi Jess, unfortunately I wasn’t home when hub opened the honey almond Ritter chocolate so didn’t take photos nor stop him from throwing it. I did see the first one that had a problem - the chocolate was very soft and there was a small pool of oil inside the packet.
9886 2018-11-10 18:21:38 Shhhhhh. Don't tell him or he'll start oil drilling in Yosemite!!!
9887 2018-11-10 18:21:37 Even they shouldn’t be laughing.  If the US plunges into chaos and the American economy tanks, those economies are export dependent and would put their own power in jeopardy.  Extended oil price lows threaten even Putin. Consumer goods market tanking would be a disaster for China
9888 2018-11-10 18:21:37 Maybe if patience was at the price of oil I would never run out of it.
9889 2018-11-10 18:21:35 Bullshit vrenezueala is in trouble because it’s leaders mismanaged their oil revenues you are a Tory lier spreading false news
9890 2018-11-10 18:21:23 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.

9892 2018-11-10 18:20:55 They claim all own brand items are palm oil free
9893 2018-11-10 18:20:31 Fun fact ladies and gents: STOP BUYING THAT EXPENSIVE BRUSH CLEANER and get you a bottle of Dawn dish soap. It works hella good. It is designed to eliminate grease (oil buildup), works SUPER FAST, and is gentle on delicate fibers.
9894 2018-11-10 18:20:09 Look at this tough guy! I’m sure he eats nothing but read meat and motor oil.  So much gumption on the right.  I mean   Look at the proud boys.  All of them.  So tough. I’m sure mom makes sure they don’t eat soy.
9895 2018-11-10 18:19:53 Which is why we need to break our dependance on oil, period. Full stop. Fast track the development of alternative fuels while we still have our own reserves, and nearby friendly nations to draw from.
9896 2018-11-10 18:19:46 Disgraceful. Oil, Arabs, FFP, Plastics bring it on, but this has crossed a line.
9897 2018-11-10 18:19:46 Good grief, they literally *are* funded by big oil, with a plan to offload the costs of environmental regulation on consumers!
9898 2018-11-10 18:19:43 Can use sprayable uk grown oil (eg hemp) instead of margarine.
9899 2018-11-10 18:19:40 Everyday is a battle in Hongkong. Well..democracy is declining in many parts of the world, so we aren’t too alone in this. Add oil #Hongkong
9900 2018-11-10 18:19:21 Or countries with oil are more rich especially when they tend to enslave people by holding their passports to make shit , never go to Dubai or Saudi Arabia
9901 2018-11-10 18:19:19 Yeah me too however they are the first uk supermarket to remove palm oil from their own brand products
9902 2018-11-10 18:19:12 Dis one is werey certified ooo, Bread & Palm oil? 
9903 2018-11-10 18:19:06 Do you ever think about how coconut oil starts heating up at 350 degrees when you cook with it and that someone out there is using a coconut oil “conditioning treatment” on their hair and then flat ironing it with their 400 degree flat iron?!?
9904 2018-11-10 18:19:04 Any plans for doing expose on Nanar oil refinery (Maharashtra)...
9905 2018-11-10 18:18:57 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
9906 2018-11-10 18:18:29 @NutellaGlobal @NutellaUSA @nutelladay When are you going to stop putting palm oil in your product? Your customers want to know how you are going to protect nature rather than help destroy it. #palmoil #IcelandAdvert
9907 2018-11-10 18:18:28 Medj nasugat daliri ko kaka-blend nung oil pastel
9908 2018-11-10 18:18:25 Aldi have palm oil free stuff.
9909 2018-11-10 18:18:25 if you don’t have a cleanser, mix olive oil and antibacterial dish soap 1:1. it cleans and sanitizes the brushes while returning them soft. also, rubbing alcohol spray is fantastic for in between use.
9910 2018-11-10 18:18:21 Would you say the palm oil industry influenced the clearcast decision?
9911 2018-11-10 18:18:18 There are other legitimate reasons for absentee ballots: College students far from home; oil rig workers on month-long "deployment;" firefighters who work multiple-day shifts. But limit ballots to such legitimate reasons, with strict chain-of-custody laws that are followed.
9912 2018-11-10 18:18:14 Do you like to use shortening, lard, peanut oil, bacon grease or something else to fry chicken? @hooleil @mollitudo @MastaOpuppetz ?
9913 2018-11-10 18:18:08 @simpleskin why did you have to discontinue the Oil Balancing range? The moisturiser was my holy grail and now it's gone 
9914 2018-11-10 18:18:07 Does blue check mean stupid? 
Just wondered, as it appears there are so many of them that are.. /sarc

9916 2018-11-10 18:18:02 Disingenuous in the fact that it isn't the "Iceland Christmas Advert" it is a Greenpeace film that has been taken on by Iceland. I don't have a problem with a campaign against Palm Oil, in fact I have shared the clip, but why the need for dishonesty?
9917 2018-11-10 18:17:53 Texas A&M and November are like oil and water.
9918 2018-11-10 18:17:48 Trudeau doesn't give a dam about the Western Canadian Energy Sector. Canada is headed for another recession. When oil and gas suffers the whole Country is going to suffer. Thanks Trudeau. Just another attack on the hard working people of this so called nation.
9919 2018-11-10 18:17:41 My dad checked my oil and it wouldn’t even read it was that low. That’s how life is going lately.
9920 2018-11-10 18:17:22 L'identité francienne (France de langue d'oïl) est une réalité mais c'est assez différent de l’État dit "français".
9921 2018-11-10 18:17:22 ALL I want when I’m this sick is my boyfriend and olbas oil, absolute magic combo
9922 2018-11-10 18:17:20 ↬ gently brush your lips with a toothbrush with coconut oil or just water. do this 2-3x a week.   
↬ use a lip scrub or make one:  
- coconut oil or olive oil 
 - sugar   
- honey   
apply this to your lips but don't scrub harshly
9923 2018-11-10 18:17:15 it feels like my blood is itchy in my legs and you wanna move them about but that makes it worse it’s horrible when you’re trying to sleep as well!!!! and i’m on a lot of painkillers anyway bc i have chronic back pain/fibromyalgia etc but i use cbd oil too it’s so good!!!
9924 2018-11-10 18:17:06 Currently getting an oil change. He tried to sell me some fuel thing that would normally cost me $229 but today, he would give it to me for $108, idk bro but that sounds like a scam to me.
9925 2018-11-10 18:17:05 i cant find my tea tree oil and im breaking out so bad ugh
9926 2018-11-10 18:17:04 She’s tough man lmao I just gotta figure out how ima shove the oil down her throat
9927 2018-11-10 18:16:53 To have run out of oil, means at one time there WAS oil.
9928 2018-11-10 18:16:51 Just about everything has palm oil in it? Human beings survived without palm feckin oil since the dawn of the age of man...up until recently. I'm sure people who aren't greedy, corporate bastards will, yet again - survive without it!
9929 2018-11-10 18:16:42 Oh, the vegetable oil one for sure sure
9930 2018-11-10 18:16:20 It's basically a triangle shaped pastry (either filo or pastry made from scratch) filled with vegetable, meat or chicken. Or whatever filling you like and then folded over to make shape of a samosa and then fried in oil.
9931 2018-11-10 18:16:08 Who says no to Disneyland!! Lmfaooo what does she like? Tell her you'll download a cool new game on her tablet if she has one bahahaha omg what if she watches you take one for the team and have a little oil lol she's just Gona look at you like NAHHHH
9932 2018-11-10 18:16:02 It's the advert that they were going to use over the festive period to raise awareness of palm oil in our food and beauty products you fkn tit.
9933 2018-11-10 18:15:59 아 내일 월요일인데 진짜 오늘은 하루종일 집에만 있고싶다 하 진짜 제발
9934 2018-11-10 18:15:49 That @Onnit MCT oil makes it that much better
9935 2018-11-10 18:15:48 Palm oil exports grew sharply after the European Union declared a mandatory quota to replace gasoline and diesel from crude oil with biofuels. In 2007, it raised the biofuel target to 10 percent of transportation fuels by 2020, driving the price of palm oil higher and ratcheting-
9936 2018-11-10 18:15:48 Ah thank you. Let me start putting together a list of tested and trusted brands. Met one lady in pharmacy in phase 1 the other day, she recommended I try some almond oil with vit c powder in it.
9937 2018-11-10 18:15:46 I’ve been natural for more than 10 years now! So I typically do natural silk presses with a steam or hot oil treatment every once in a while during the winter!
9938 2018-11-10 18:15:41 Unbelievable. Disrespectful. Just thinks of himself... Don't Sirkosky fly in wet weather? The same type that fly from the oil rigs to Scotland in ALL weather's..?? Narcissistic
9939 2018-11-10 18:15:40 Restraints, massage oil, maybe a blind fold and gag ...
9940 2018-11-10 18:15:31 I know I gotta change the oil in my car soon.
9941 2018-11-10 18:15:28 Oil change coming up my car just told me lol #Lexus
9942 2018-11-10 18:15:18 Today language left my mouth for a few hours and I literally could not speak and I found myself being prayed upon,annointing oil everywhere,people speaking in tongues casting demons&bad spirits out of me.
9943 2018-11-10 18:15:15 My dear Topsinmaja you Lie if you said we were importing everything from rice to palm oil. The PDP government under GEJ did a lot for agriculture. Compare your body weight of then and now. Also compare the amount of money you spent feeding then and now..
9944 2018-11-10 18:15:06 Specialist police tasters work to uncover adulterated foods, especially olive oil. Their taste buds are considered so precise that the findings are even admissible in Italian courts #Italy #foodMafia #ItalianPolice #Policia

9947 2018-11-10 18:14:56 Hmm personally I’d say the two are one in the same. Vegans just tend to get pretty passionate about the palm oil thing so you really can’t blame people for talking about both. Thanks for the screenshot

9949 2018-11-10 18:14:45 tbh I've avoided palm oil for the last couple of months. Biscuits are the hardest, every biscuit bar Choco Leibniz has palm oil in it appears.
9950 2018-11-10 18:14:44 Look at all the fur!!  What a wonderful young woman to take in this baby and help him heal.  Good call with the coconut oil!  The vet gave up,but she didn't.
9951 2018-11-10 18:14:39 we can get/buy USA attention to help by suggesting say 300, 000 barrels of free oil per day for 5 years plus, you must set up a good team - if at all interested etc etc
9952 2018-11-10 18:14:36 Just hanging out waiting for the welcome wagon. Despite the tough rhetoric most of these people will be released into the country.
Because of courts they have no choice.
9953 2018-11-10 18:14:34 You might enjoy the movie Cowspiracy, its on Netflix, animal agriculture dwarfs palm oil as a cause of deforestation and rain forest destruction. Dairy is very destructive. All fats are bad for our health, I eat a plant based whole food diet, we are always being mislead by adds
9954 2018-11-10 18:14:34 A saw a customer that was soooo damn fine today. Whew Chile, all I need is some baby oil and 5 mins, Jesus please.

9957 2018-11-10 18:14:03 referenced with the broken pan handle, could be a subtle hint provided to understand the Italian cars required to have added muscle car features, exposing the Italian cars production as drops of oil picked to date cool porn actresses. The ones finding comfort after being
9958 2018-11-10 18:14:03 Simply not good enough, @waitrose. Fair enough if you can’t yet replace existing products that rely on palm oil, but introducing new convenience products with palm oil is just irresponsible. The John Lewis charm is wearing very thin at the moment.
9959 2018-11-10 18:13:55 Very lucky  have been to   #Sepilok saw  #Orangutans in #Borneo  also a small palm oil plantation in #CostaRica a depressing area for the familys on the outskirts its a  dirty production in a beautiful country never buy it great that we hav you at #pompey you ar a good role model
9960 2018-11-10 18:13:42 So, tell me Lindsey, do you use flavored lube when you suck his mushroom? Or just olive oil and spices for a sauteed flavor?
9961 2018-11-10 18:13:40 Why do ppl take their whole ass extended families just to get an oil change
9962 2018-11-10 18:13:24 Oil&Gas are doing the same thing they leave corridors for the caribou call it protecting their habitat Now this species is facing extinction

9981 2018-11-10 18:12:14 Orangutan Politics

Palm oil is too political 
So let’s blanket out
The painful truth
With a pitiful excuse
While orangutans fight diggers
In decimated lands
No amount of washing 
With clean blood from our hands
A pointless oil
Has become a serial killer 
Destroying vast hab…
9982 2018-11-10 18:12:13 Tried a CBD Oil Latter and a Charcoal Milk one, both pretty good.
9983 2018-11-10 18:12:12 by all means, cut palm oil out of your diet...that’s an amazing step to take for reducing your impact on the deforestation of our rainforests!
9984 2018-11-10 18:11:57 All that baby oil applied,  and my hands are still ashy.
9985 2018-11-10 18:11:53 He doesn’t believe in climate change & even made environmental protection laws weaker in some areas so they can look for oil and natural gas on (what used to be) federally protected land. It’s all about money for him. Not the environment or people’s health. He doesn’t care
9986 2018-11-10 18:11:40 That's literally the recipe. I buy vegan schnitzel, bean pasta and then make a sauce called "Brown sauce" in Swedish. 

My salad is fresh spinach leaves (??) With avocado. Some olive oil and salt. 

It's really easy and fresh and tasty and I'm so obsessed.
9987 2018-11-10 18:11:39 I'm not sold. He incorrectly defines what "quality of life" is (vs. stnd of living), his data is skewed, and his emotional introduction is empty. He makes 1 point tho: when oil came along it disrupted industries. I would argue that's happening again, but oil is out not coal
9988 2018-11-10 18:11:37 Same with me David I patronise Iceland  because of their stance  on Palm oil and  the devastation of the forests to acquire it ,
9989 2018-11-10 18:11:30 Simply your wrong : )

You can drive a car, you could change you oil or figure out how to tune your engine, both are best practices

In practice maybe 25%-50% of users W/Could install and use a password manager

I am talking about the USA, in the world this drops to 10%-20%
9990 2018-11-10 18:11:22 The other one-dish vegetarian thing we do frequently that has more protein is roast chickpeas with paprika, salt, and olive oil ~20 minutes, toss kale in still-hot pan to wilt.

Also works as non-veg with any meat roasted in the pan for fat instead of olive oil.
9991 2018-11-10 18:11:18 Nice. Set of sketches comin' up!
9992 2018-11-10 18:11:18 This is a test, there isn't that many tweets to choose from yet and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
9993 2018-11-10 18:11:17 All Quiet on the Western Front is so relevant today.

The deluded teacher has been replaced by mainstream medias romanticism of wars for oil.

Moronic cowards killing kids with drones regarding themselves as protecting freedom.
9994 2018-11-10 18:11:12 Joseph Niepce developed the world’s first photographic image in 1827. Thomas Edison and W K L Dickson introduced the film camera in 1894. But the first projection of an image on a screen was made by a German priest. In 1646, Athanasius Kircher used a candle or oil lamp to pr…
9995 2018-11-10 18:10:58 I relate. If you can, try cbd oil. I got over exhausted and ended up in ER with a racing heart. They gave me a short term prescription which I try to avoid medicine but it's helping me get the rest I seriously needed. Going to cbd after this next week.
9996 2018-11-10 18:10:57 Lol took you 10 games to oil up those wheels. Bad penalty negates what was a hard fought 1st lol
9997 2018-11-10 18:10:50 Bio oil or rose hip oil; whatever you do, do it whilst they’re red bc your stretch marks are active and fade quicker when treated. White ones are old marks and are harder to get rid of
9998 2018-11-10 18:10:45 And after all this.....I still have to get an oil change. Clearly life just hates me
9999 2018-11-10 18:10:33 Well i was taking vitamin d, spraying eucalyptus oil in the shower before i used it and i also took airborne chewables during the tc portion of the trip. Oh and i got my flu shot! So maybe thats the miracle immunity booster?

10001 2018-11-10 18:10:13 /rlt/ gaes tida ada yg mau hibahin tamanu oil ke diriku? :(
10002 2018-11-10 18:10:12 梱包美術
10003 2018-11-10 18:10:10 Absolutely, and going to palm oil free!
10004 2018-11-10 18:10:06 I hate waiting at the car dealership bc everyone always comes and harasses me with every little thing. Like no, I don’t wanna buy a new car I’m just waiting for an oil change thanks 
10005 2018-11-10 18:10:03 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
10006 2018-11-10 18:09:59 Its clear that neither of u understand the situation of our energy sector. Getting more access to refineries in Houston designed to refine heavy oil will add value to our resource. Right now Keystone routes to Illinois the most saturated market in NA which leads to huge discount
10007 2018-11-10 18:09:59 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the publisher of the National Enquirer. It has a mandate to support the oil companies and is working to introduce US style conservatism to Canada. It is propaganda, not news.
10008 2018-11-10 18:09:30 Who in the #OOTT community will be hitting ADIPEC 2018 the next days? Let me know, always looking for a good chat/analysis on oil and gas, including geopolitics, in Abu Dhabi, especially if you are in the Petroleum Club!
10009 2018-11-10 18:09:23 Nor me it’s a brilliant advert. I’ve plastered it over fb. At least I now know they don’t use palm oil  guess where I’ll start shopping? 
10010 2018-11-10 18:09:20 Haan Maine oil jyaada daala tha..
10011 2018-11-10 18:09:16 Dear @waitrose why do you persist in creating new products which include palm oil? Am forced to the conclusion that you are rapidly losing the ethical credentials you once had.
10012 2018-11-10 18:09:15 おっはー☆
10013 2018-11-10 18:09:10 @TedCruz and @StephenHarper are the same person.

Both are slimeball Albertans who hate science, have a general disregard for the citizens of their countries while claiming to love them. And neither is truly happy unless they are jerking off a Texan oil baron.
10014 2018-11-10 18:09:09 They sell us oil and buy weapons & treasuries. So, no, no human rights violations.
10015 2018-11-10 18:09:04 Aloe vera, then olive oil
10016 2018-11-10 18:08:52 I slept so long on one side of my body that it hurts.. 
Is this what getting old feels like?
Thank the Lord for my CBD oil! I'll let y'all know if it helps this! Uffda. My hip and my shoulder is killing me! 
10017 2018-11-10 18:08:50 sunflower oil aja sis!!!
10018 2018-11-10 18:08:35 Thanks. They say my grandfather was never the same after he got back home. He ended up working in an oil field in Oklahoma and as a Rancher. He was originally from Missouri. He passed away in his 80’s.
10019 2018-11-10 18:08:35 Heb 1:8-9

But about the Son He says:

“Your throne, O God, endures forever & ever,
& justice is the scepter of Your kingdom. You have loved righteousness & hated wickedness;
therefore God, Your God, has placed You above Your companions
by anointing You with the oil of joy.”
10020 2018-11-10 18:08:22 It’s “No Nut November” and @ChickfilA thinks they’re slick cooking everything in peanut oil  LMAO they’re cancelled til December 
10021 2018-11-10 18:08:18 Coconut oil is great and sustainable, had a coffee made with coconut milk the other day . . . . Really great taste. !

10025 2018-11-10 18:08:11 We need solar panels and pastoral care!

We support people that are going through change (we are in a very oil rich province so there are a lot of uncertainties) and we support the notion of forward thinking and planning for the future.
10026 2018-11-10 18:08:03 Bae took my car to get a oil change i appreciate him so much  .
10027 2018-11-10 18:08:02 Almond oil
10028 2018-11-10 18:07:54 I like this one a lot. I need to draw her.
10029 2018-11-10 18:07:51 When the people of the Middle East become more important than oil, then they may know peace. May.
10030 2018-11-10 18:07:47 See the parks before the president sells them off to the oil companies!
