But why the doubting? Seriously, if you aren't convinced by now that Q and Trump are legit, what's wrong?

38 2018-08-27 23:55:59 D voodoo economy continues. We just ve a bunch of lazy peps leading us at Federal and State levels. Complete over reliance on crude oil shd be halted. No oil, no salaries, d day we finally run out of oil or when d world moves on 2 an alt source of energy, our trouble will begin.
39 2018-08-27 23:55:57 LOL interesting! Shea Butter + coconut oil are my go to combo. My SIL makes pure homemade coconut oil, it's divine!

42 2018-08-27 23:55:39 I only started drawing political drawings because of my hate for this jerk. I normally only do oil painting.

50 2018-08-27 23:54:15 What’s your opinion on equalization payments? It seems natural Resources are programmed in equalization payments at a rate of 50 percent.  This seems very unfair seeing that Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Quebec are sitting on massive oil and gas reserves but all 3 provinces has
51 2018-08-27 23:54:09 Hopefully the tea tree oil fixes the bump in my nose issue. I'm about ready to cork up this hole.
52 2018-08-27 23:54:00 From what I can tell, the future of brick-and-mortar shops is entirely social signaling and/or shopping as entertainment. For everything else, we're supposed to pay Jeff Bezos $5, of which $4.50 goes into his pocket and 50¢ goes to a snake oil factory in Shenzen.

57 2018-08-27 23:53:23 Cooking with pam spray to substitute oil is an unfortunate suffering. Better than nothing, but only slightly.

59 2018-08-27 23:53:10 PDP ran 30 states bankrupt when oil sold as high as $120 - $150/ pb.
PMB bailed them out when oil sold as low as $28pb

63 2018-08-27 23:52:20 Now the Americans are trying to overthrow the current Iranian government because it’s in Israel’s and America’s interests. Let’s be honest here, this is about oil and the petrodollar, it’s got jackshit to do with nuclear weapons. Just more lies from Israel and the US as per usual

70 2018-08-27 23:51:37 I also went through a bad haircut experience. I did scalp massages using Jamaican Black Castor Oil & Peppermint Oil, take biotin pills every morning (10,000 MCG), and did low manipulation styles. My hair has grown so much since that bad haircut day back in May. Hope this helps!

73 2018-08-27 23:51:34 I’ll tell you something I expect will surprise you. The oil burners throughout NYC spew more particulate matter and pollution than all of the cars and trucks combined.

78 2018-08-27 23:50:51 The fact of the matter is that California had a large geographic footprint that was rich in natural resources (e.g., oil, gas, metals, timber, raw land, water, etc.) when it mattered most during the highest population growth in US history. They had a head start and parlayed it.

93 2018-08-27 23:47:59 This past weekend I went out with my friends and the first thing @CameronMullins_ said when getting in my car is “Here’s your buttplug” referring to the funnel thing that helps you put oil and stuff in your car

96 2018-08-27 23:46:30 A state oil refinery that imports most of its oil, running a considerable net foreign currency outflow and sustaining chronic financial losses in the midst of serious national economic decline. How many sensible options are there, really? #TrinidadandTobago

103 2018-08-27 23:45:33 Do your research well, things worked well when Donald Duke was governor of Cross River State, since then no governor has been able to represent after he left,  because of the same poor mentality that if a state doesn't have oil,  it has nothing.
104 2018-08-27 23:45:26 Genco olive oil. Straight from Sicily.
105 2018-08-27 23:45:17 Yeah, I brush it with a little Olive Oil on the non-skin having side and put just a bit of Paul Prudhomme's blackened redfish seasoning on it. Then just a little bit of lemon juice before serving.
106 2018-08-27 23:45:01 Came home to my oil changed, tires rotated, and one of my favorite things to eat. I love this man!
107 2018-08-27 23:44:56 Heirloom tomatoes on artisan bread that I make. Little olive oil little goat cheese, feel like a trillion bucks.

109 2018-08-27 23:44:41 Makes me immensely happy the number of people who have cited food they have made or grown themselves! I agree that homemade pasta is one of the least expensive fancy foods you can make. Flour, eggs, oil, & salt.
110 2018-08-27 23:44:32 Canada is the largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the U.S., accounting for 43% of total U.S. crude oil imports.

115 2018-08-27 23:43:38 YES! Drinking more water and going pescatarian has majorly helped better my overall wellbeing. But for a great night's sleep, I love taking a hot shower, drinking herbal tea, plugging in the essential oil diffuser, and meditating and listening to soundscapes, etc. with @calm
116 2018-08-27 23:43:36 I need to bathe myself in lavender oil. My patience is being tested x100 today!

119 2018-08-27 23:43:19 How about the USA is just about to overtake Iran as the world's largest exporter of oil. Trump has been a bit of twat lately, reinstating sanctions on Iran without the support of the wider international community and following a punitive international trade policy. Do the maths.

136 2018-08-27 23:40:55 From what I've seen if it's like biotin or hair n nails gummies I think it targets head hair only and doesn't affect hormones related to body hair. Also! I've seen Camille Rose hair growth serum/oil work WONDERS for a lot of ppl. It's $$$$ but I've seen dupes too!!

144 2018-08-27 23:38:58 Put oil companies out of business and there’s no more industrial ag. Great! But that means population reductions will occur. It means half the labor force or more return to working on farms. These are the kinds of changes i’m taking about

147 2018-08-27 23:38:35 Well, your twitch rule speaks very different from your presence on Twitter. "Wheaton's law ("Don't be a dick")". Blessings to you in life Nate, though I doubt you want blessings any more than you do beard oil.
148 2018-08-27 23:38:32 His opponent, Beto, is eloquent, hard working, and promises to be a great figure in history. Cruz is now an oil slick on the DJT Ocean of Corruption.
149 2018-08-27 23:38:24 For various historical events and reasons returning self-governance has been a necessity since it was clear Scotland would always be out-voted, more pressing once oil was discovered. I find odd people are masochists - vote Yes only after enduring pain inflicted again and again.

151 2018-08-27 23:37:33 Stretch marks are really just a genetic thing. If your momma had em, you probably will too. I had none up until literally week 35.. it sucked lol. Coconut oil is great for your skin tho and really nice to massage your tummy just for relaxation! Also, congrats 
152 2018-08-27 23:37:32 @LouDobbs Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc, have aggregated MONOPOLY POWER, just as Standard Oil did in the early 1900's.  Just as Standard Oil was deemed to have violated anti-trust laws, so have the tech giants.  They need, at a minimum to be regulated, or broken up!
153 2018-08-27 23:37:25 James Inhofe was already a proven dumbass oil industry shill. Now he's a proven lickspittle to a would-be dictator. Fuck that guy.
154 2018-08-27 23:36:58 How does it take that long for an oil change?
155 2018-08-27 23:36:51 Don't know what you were expecting  krauts one of these people that pretend to be intellectual so they can lord over young and dumb people. Snake oil salesmen. And YouTube is full of them.
156 2018-08-27 23:36:39 Also oil company girl
157 2018-08-27 23:36:38 I challenge you to listen to your actual constituents for once, instead of being more interested in big oil companies. How about you debate Steve Riddell?
158 2018-08-27 23:35:54 Tomatoes/eggplants great  deals around the valley. Let’s share your favourite recipes. My fav just fry slices in oil. Shepherds pie. Lab eh. Fried & preserved in oil.

159 2018-08-27 23:35:54 Hi there! If, like me, you are struggling with depression/being alive in general and are unable to try cannabis...might I suggest you try CBD oil? I am blown away by how great I feel.
160 2018-08-27 23:35:44 Ha ha the sooner this snake oil salesmen leaves our shores the better.
161 2018-08-27 23:35:38 recuerdo primera vez que postularon a lorenzo  y el respondio que no era posible. su presidencia es polar aqui y en el exterior donde polar tiene inversiones aun antes de que lorenzo naciera. Beatrice compañia grande de alimentos en el mundo es polar.
162 2018-08-27 23:35:29 11. Not funding franking pipes and big oil.
12. Donating unneeded funds to resolve poverty that billionaires and millionaires deliberately ignore.

164 2018-08-27 23:35:13 No but really I just Exfoliate,exfoliate, exfoliate with shea moisture ground coffee scrub with  argan oil. Then coconut oil mixed in with Nivea lotion every morning and nights
165 2018-08-27 23:34:26 I'm no fan of Corbyn but even he couldn't make such a hash of the economy as they have done. They rested the investment and economy of the country on just one source of income: Oil. That's it. Not even bananas! Just oil. So, when the price of oil fell through the floor...

168 2018-08-27 23:33:33 Oil company, what’s it like spewing out marketing bullshit whilst polluting our only home into threatened oblivion, for money?
169 2018-08-27 23:33:31 Yup u right!!! Someone gonna have to slide some oil to me like the ten man on the Wiz.

184 2018-08-27 23:30:55 One of my exes was way down the rabbit hole when it came to rough sex (bruising, forceful hits, etc.) Asked me to kick her in the chest after heavy foreplay, but too much oil made my foot connect to her chin. She still mad bout her chipped tooth, call her snagglepuss

191 2018-08-27 23:30:24 Bag Oil! Soap packets!
192 2018-08-27 23:30:13 Baffling. If India aspires to be superpower, it needs to be seen as Indian (not USA copycat), confident and not trying to appease anyone.

On other hand, maybe India hoping to extract concessions (eg allow iran oil, S-400 & we give you parade & maybe more hotel business?)

195 2018-08-27 23:29:58 Them niggas are pathetic. I went to a lunch & we got on the topic of beard oil & a few asked do women like it & the waiter couldn’t close my ticket out fast enough.
196 2018-08-27 23:29:47 Will the price of gas go down with the repeal? Or will big oil make bigger profit from the 12 cents they don’t have to give back?
197 2018-08-27 23:29:35 Shame on you. Siding with that awful Trump, a snake oil salesman, against a patriot. #historywillremember
198 2018-08-27 23:29:33 Junior mints sprinkled on top of popcorn that was made with Chinese hot oil. Mmmmm.
199 2018-08-27 23:29:11 I drove to walmart to buy oil for my car and when I got there I realized I didn’t have my wallet and that’s my punishment for going to walmart
200 2018-08-27 23:28:48 @LouDobbs WHY IS TRUMP ALLOWING THE OIL COMPANIES TO RAISE THE PRICE OF FUEL?, IT'S  ONLY  HURTING RETIRED PEOPLE!, HE GAVE  THE OIL COMPANIES A HUGE TAX BREAK,  AND THERE STILL  GOUDGING THE PEOPLE.  NOT VERY GOOD.
201 2018-08-27 23:28:44 Ive also heard a couple drops of tea tree oil in water sprayed on you works, but i havent had a chance to try it
202 2018-08-27 23:28:41 @SecPompeo Jewish media only support the Iranian regime,these fake media are no longer credible.Iranian navy is like toys and it is easily destroyed,America is the world's first power and is not afraid of them.According to Iran's oil export plan,it will be cut off by November 4th
203 2018-08-27 23:28:37 Agree that this is both important and under-discussed. Fall of oil prices late 14 through 16 had big impact on investment and subsequent rebound did too. We really are more of an oil producer than we used to be and it is changing macro and trade relationships. Cc @Brad_Setser
204 2018-08-27 23:28:31 Same with the "loving husband and father" who had "financial difficulties" to explain away killing wife, unborn child, and two children.    Or he "snapped" after wife killed the children and then hid the bodies in vat of oil and buried wife.
205 2018-08-27 23:28:29 Yung bumili,
206 2018-08-27 23:28:14 Coconut oil!!!! It helps a lot with sunburns. Also make sure you stay hydrated. 
207 2018-08-27 23:27:45 yo i take fish oil pills too!
208 2018-08-27 23:27:45 Exports account for a small part of the economy and the top ten are things like arms, pharma, oil and cars. Those things make no difference to me or most of us, "helps UK exports" is code for makes bosses more money in those indistries. It's rent seeking at best.
209 2018-08-27 23:27:39 bought some oil paints and canvas and paintbrushes to try painting. turns out it's really hard and now I'm angry
210 2018-08-27 23:27:36 According to @POTUS , car manufacturing is what is left to negotiate. EV car manufacturing may be a negotiation win for both sides (and for EV). Trudeau has had a rough year because of oil/gas infrastructure and oil sands being not as competitive as US oil. #EV #Diversify #WinWin
211 2018-08-27 23:27:06 Have you tried fried green tomatoes? My version is medium think slices sprayed with coconut oil dipped in fine ground panko baked at 375° till panko is golden and tomatoes are soft but not soggy which takes about 20 minutes. I am very happy you have such an abundance.
212 2018-08-27 23:26:33 Love asparagus  Roasted them tonight with good extra virgin olive oil , garlic and Parmesan cheese .

215 2018-08-27 23:26:22 example) cut the grass so in exchange we help with inside chores. I get it yes woman CAN cut the grass and men CAN do the dishes but let’s be real. No woman is going to want to be doing an oil change, washing/vacuuming their cars, cutting the grass etc.

217 2018-08-27 23:26:12 Tomato sauce is a mystery sometimes, I didn’t have much at home so it was passata, dried chives, dried Italian herb mix, fresh garlic, olive oil and a little bit of vegetable stock and it was one of the best sauces I’ve ever made 
218 2018-08-27 23:25:59 Butter and OIL! You will burn in yankee hell... there is no escape... only Jesus... #sin @trump

220 2018-08-27 23:25:50 I have a headache and the rental has been at the shop for an oil change for 3 hours now. Rescue me from hell.
221 2018-08-27 23:25:43 I would rather drive 2 and half hours to the triangle to change your oil for free than to let you take your vehicle to Jiffy Lube. Rake those guys over the coal!

223 2018-08-27 23:25:33 Peppermint oil! + Deep condition overnight, EVERY week!
224 2018-08-27 23:25:23 we screwed, 200-400yrs with no beaches on Earth. public needs disaster(s) to destroy Big Oil FUD and they will get plenty.

227 2018-08-27 23:25:05 Nobody wants to talk about that. If it's yours ask for help. But we are locking people up here after their land has been taking and not for the greater good but for oil tycoons.
228 2018-08-27 23:25:05 Bago mangyari yun dapat napalitan muna Fake VP
229 2018-08-27 23:24:34 I don't understand. What are you claiming is wrong with canola oil?
230 2018-08-27 23:24:21 Ooo I have cedarwood oil! I should try that tonight. I’ve tried lavender and peace and calm and nothing seems to help. Melatonin worked for about a year but is starting to not work so my mind just keeps racing all night long
231 2018-08-27 23:24:14 I’m glad the marijuana helps it’s one thing I haven’t tried because it’s illegal.  I tried numerous strains of Kratom and CBD oil none helped me but I’m so happy when they help anyone. I say give me agent orange or dog poop in a capsule if it keeps me from having torturous pain.
232 2018-08-27 23:24:10 "In 1973, President Richard Nixon unilaterally severed the U.S. dollar from the gold standard and convinced the Saudis and the rest of the OPEC countries to sell their oil only in dollars, since then global oil trade has been linked to the American currency".
233 2018-08-27 23:24:00 Yeah and one is a struggling brewery the other has applied to process canabis oil. 
234 2018-08-27 23:23:57 Hindi naman ata sila kristyano ehh
235 2018-08-27 23:23:49 Why are we still their? Trying to steal the oil? Give the people their land back!
236 2018-08-27 23:23:36 Bought it a couple months ago and put new rims and tires, new brakes and oil change. Truck needs absolutely nothing and I would drive it to California. I’m selling because I’m in collage and could use the extra money.  Rims and tires are 35-12.5-20   -44s
237 2018-08-27 23:23:34 I had to get this coconut oil for my hair my shit was dry for like the past week lol
238 2018-08-27 23:23:32 I was in Syria just before the war started. The Syrians were agog that we paid income tax.The Govt. paid directly for education, healthcare etc straight out of the oil money earned.Seemed a good idea to me.
239 2018-08-27 23:23:30 So tell me what there doing there. Is it like the gov here building there oil pipeline and calling it eminent domain for oil. Texas to Canada. Or is it land that doesn't belong to you. That was taking by you. And how many people did you kill to get it.
240 2018-08-27 23:23:18 Credit to the Dems for low gas prices, please. This came from the US fracking revolution and the UAE, Kuwait, Russia and S.A. ramping up production all at once from outrageous prices from 2011-2014. Worldwide disruptions in Libya and Iran kept oil prices artificially high....
241 2018-08-27 23:23:15 Dog 1 - I understand your fetish - think of all the good, crispy bits of leftover food suspended in the oil.  Dog 2 - I really think you need to reconsider your gastronomic priorities.
242 2018-08-27 23:23:12 I need to rent a boyfriend just for when I need to get an oil change so I can stop saying "Aht  Aht, PUT THAT BACK" 
243 2018-08-27 23:23:08 Gotta cover that shit in olive oil and roast on the grill!
244 2018-08-27 23:23:06 Still trying to get rid of our wasp nest just under our sidewalk. They aren't so happy I used some peppermint oil on them. No mail until they are gone.
245 2018-08-27 23:23:06 I don't think they were that bad last year. They had decent results after they switched the engine layout due to the oil partner change Mclaren abruptly went into. The 2015-16 engine was Mclaren's size zero direction that caused the problems.
246 2018-08-27 23:23:02 Canada and California are much more in tune regarding environmental concerns. See if EV can get tariff exemption. PM Trudeau would do well to diversify now from oil/gas. “People tax” stopped expansion of a oil pipeline.  CA oil is naturally disadvantaged US Fracking/OffShore Oil.
247 2018-08-27 23:22:55 Promise #240: I will anoint you with oil so your cup overflows (Read Psalm 23:5).

252 2018-08-27 23:22:34 Sanctioning Russia for annexing crimea but not #Myanmar @TheMyanmarTimes  is hypocrisy of the highest level.. why did we invade Iraq but we can't intervene where it really matters.. oh because no oil..
253 2018-08-27 23:22:27 provides for that. That's determined by the authority, the commission and run out of the Oil and Gas Commission. By adding this 2/5
254 2018-08-27 23:22:21 No, just that gov't in New Mexico already has enough money and did even when oil prices were low. If they'd dismantled the RailRunner and cut film and other corporate subsidies, then we could at least talk about the revenue side.
255 2018-08-27 23:21:59 Wondering the briyani that she nicely ate was made from olive oil.....she thanked kamal for itwhat a drama gumtaz just because its all free supply for you for 3 months
256 2018-08-27 23:21:56 Yet, oil demand is near 95 million bbls/day, and growing. This year by about 1.5 million bbls/day. Solar investment will fall this year 25%. 

The world is saying it needs, and wants, oil; not solar.
257 2018-08-27 23:21:42 The irony.
I'm conflicted about this as well, but we do need to take action to protect our shoreline, and I would rather have big oil engaged in the fight rather than seeing environmentalist going it alone as is usually the case.

260 2018-08-27 23:21:14 It would.

But that's equivocation, isn't it? Why not blame more the one that TAKES more?

Here's the deal: Government gets FAR MORE per gallon of gas than does "Big Oil". Did you not know that?
261 2018-08-27 23:20:56 What day at work is complete if you haven’t wound up covered in mineral oil and toting two swollen LiPo battery packs to hazmat for disposal?
262 2018-08-27 23:20:54 Took my truck in to get an oil change and they came out looking for “Mr. Brenton” 
263 2018-08-27 23:20:40 Would like to take a moment to congratulate Mexico on believing that a deal with Trump is a good thing. You gave in like a crumpled can.

269 2018-08-27 23:19:34 How ironic that you support the National Park Service when Scott Pruitt's mission was to destroy parks by cutting funding/staff & opening up some parks for businesses to destroy them by digging for oil, etc. trump is the WORST when it comes to nat'l parks.

For example, there isn’t coal or oil everywhere at all times either.

281 2018-08-27 23:18:07 I think it has to do with education and economy.  We cannot for example compare white Americans with blacks.  We cannot ignore the rule of history..we Saudis are new to civilizations thanks to oil. We want to change based on our experience with life without order from outsiders.
282 2018-08-27 23:18:03 I just want and need a full body massage. Oil me down 
283 2018-08-27 23:18:01 Sis castor oil is a life saver
284 2018-08-27 23:17:40 I agree,  it's really ridiculous, those children were put in barrels of oil no human being with a soul could do that! Why  is this being handled the way it is I believe this man is a monster.
285 2018-08-27 23:17:35 @mmtnsage have you discontinued carrying the Twilight oil?
286 2018-08-27 23:16:48 Let us hope that Vietnam is spending at least some of that on Naval forces and strengthening their army. They may need it in the future when the South China Sea situation blows up--especially if they start to drill for oil or gas on their own continental shelf, unfortunately!
287 2018-08-27 23:16:46 Want my feet washed and massaged with hot oil and then covered in a mousy warmed towel. 
288 2018-08-27 23:16:38 This morning my niece gave me a lecture and a list of all the foods we can no longer eat due to palm oil. My 9 year old niece is more environmentally and socially conscious than 90% of the adults I know. The future is bright!
289 2018-08-27 23:16:21 "In 1973, President Richard Nixon unilaterally severed the U.S. dollar from the gold standard and convinced the Saudis and the rest of the OPEC countries to sell their oil only in dollars, since then global oil trade has been linked to the American currency".

Need to read more.
290 2018-08-27 23:16:18 Too much sesame oil 
291 2018-08-27 23:16:18 Soy un desastre en todo
292 2018-08-27 23:16:08 マナカナ、相変わらず鼻がデカイな。おはようございます。
293 2018-08-27 23:16:04 hello. I’m a car. Oil is my blood. Seats belts. Radio knobs.
294 2018-08-27 23:15:16 The Quran and the Constitution go together like oil and water!
295 2018-08-27 23:15:14 The amount of sesame oil in a noodle bowl is directly proportional to the likelihood I'm going to lick that bowl. #foodieprobs
296 2018-08-27 23:15:01 Can girls work in the oil field? I’m tryna make that kind of money.
297 2018-08-27 23:14:29 apparently my car is too low to get an oil change?????????
298 2018-08-27 23:13:55 Yeah, I know. Tesla really got screwed. Tesla. We should be able to choose whether we want to use oil, gas, nuclear or wind, solar. I am eying a Chevy Bolt for my next car though
299 2018-08-27 23:13:48 Thanks! Olive oil, butter, heavy cream, 5 garlic cloves, Asiago, Mozz, parm, provolone, & some pasta water. It’s pretty delicious! I’m extremely full though and couldn’t finish it 
300 2018-08-27 23:13:47 Sorry to be this person but a salad is by definition a cold dish of various mixtures of raw or cooked vegetables, usually seasoned with oil, vinegar, or other dressing and sometimes accompanied by meat, fish, or other ingredients.
"a green salad"
301 2018-08-27 23:13:37 Yes! Try roasting it. Brush w olive oil, sprinkle w salt & pepper, roast, then drizzle w good balsamic vinegar. Mmmm
302 2018-08-27 23:13:27 @2lilbear4 trying to change oil fam? 
303 2018-08-27 23:13:10 @PabloCiarliero , Javier sabe q eso es imposible y solo creíble para gente que no entiende de oil & gas, como sería tu caso. En la comunidad técnica que compartimos con Javier, se está ganando el descrédito. Pero hoy es más político que profesional, y en 5 años nadie le reclamará
304 2018-08-27 23:12:45 Agree.  I’ve tried to study those other breeds, but they are just not pretty nor interesting enuf to hold my attention...

“Ray tracing graphics cards” - omg cool! 
“Gene splicing something...” - 
“Oil..blahblah” - ew gross, just die already plez!

Open to suggestions 
305 2018-08-27 23:12:42 Yes, but we should be careful not to make them as dependent as politics as the oil revenues. This will enable a larger potential growth and wealth distribution due to network effects.
306 2018-08-27 23:12:26 We export different oil than we import. There's different grades and types. Same source, net imports is 3.6 out of 20 that means 20%. And 20mmb/day is petroleum. Not total energy consumption.
307 2018-08-27 23:12:12 shout out to that time i sat in a train seat mysteriously soaked in olive oil and didn’t even realize until i’d been at work for 3 hours
308 2018-08-27 23:12:08 He has the “tell ‘em what they want to hear” thing down, like a true snake oil salesman.
309 2018-08-27 23:12:08 Lobster (my fiancé’s dad is a lobsterman & I come from seafaring folk & know what to do with ‘em), anything involving tomatoes/basil/olive oil, crepes, anything involving fresh berries & hand whipped cream, particularly when sweetened w/my mint sugar made from mint I grow myself.

311 2018-08-27 23:11:57 You should turn the tide against coconut oil once and for all.
312 2018-08-27 23:11:55 @KernEnergy Tracy Leach, Kern Citizens for Energy: “it’s incredibly disheartening to see some CA politicians continually work to outsource our oil and gas demands to foreign countries — many with abysmal environmental and human rights records — rather than keeping those jobs...
313 2018-08-27 23:11:22 You should try miracle or shirataki noodles my dude, they’re zero calories and taste great with coconut oil, or spiralized veggie pasta. That stuff will keep you alive during this carbless time
314 2018-08-27 23:11:11 This close friend of mine moved to SA like 10 years ago and thought Luby's was a chain of shops to get your oil changed. I have been laughing about this for MONTHS.
315 2018-08-27 23:10:44 ヴィルヘルムとあの眼鏡のにーさんとまた飲みたいなー
316 2018-08-27 23:10:41 Stop eating so much coconut oil
317 2018-08-27 23:10:35 Well said. There’s been two years of progess under Mourinho. In a climate of organically competing against oil money, Utd are between a rock and a hard place. You win and lose in football but sadly many “journalists” make it their profession to ensure Utd fail.  Sells the rags.
318 2018-08-27 23:10:25 Snake oil
319 2018-08-27 23:10:23 The United States needs more of Mexico than Mexico needs the U.S so eat shit and die and build your multi-million wall, your dollar is on the decline and Chinese currency taking over. The oil from Saudi Arabia will be backed by Chinese currency and no longer by the U.S dollar.
320 2018-08-27 23:10:21 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
321 2018-08-27 23:10:18 Aye but how many of those keep the UK afloat? The UK debt has never been so high, there is no way they are letting our revenue or oil walk without some very dirty tricks, smears and probably illegality"
322 2018-08-27 23:10:12 Republicans never had spines that weren't bought and paid for by big oil, big military, or big pharma.
323 2018-08-27 23:09:26 You are awesome
So awesome
324 2018-08-27 23:08:57 You don’t use Jamaican black castor oil ? Lol
325 2018-08-27 23:08:36 Fabian is maki f me a doing a oil
326 2018-08-27 23:08:33 You def need to sauté it in oil and ignore their directions! :)
327 2018-08-27 23:08:28 Why is it that where the oil comes from, they don’t sell it but every 500 miles. #AAA #pleasehold
328 2018-08-27 23:08:13 They are frigging ignorant. They need educating on the reason that country ended up like that. The reason Corbyn praised that country was before the oil price crash it had brought poverty down from 50% to 30% and was on the way to cutting in even further. That was the praise.
329 2018-08-27 23:08:08 You pride yourself on openmindness?! And you think you are analytical? Lol! No, you just get conned by right wing nonsense. Infowars and Fox. And it’s sad. The internet was supposed to introduce a time of great learning, but you guys just fall for the latest snake oil salesman
330 2018-08-27 23:07:57 still spending lots of money on car maintenance (new tires, alignment, oil changes) after I said I would get rid of it. smh.
331 2018-08-27 23:07:53 Setting up an oil diffuser is dead ass witch craft. Like call me a mf potions master. I’ve never felt closer to Harry Potter in my entire life.
332 2018-08-27 23:07:48 My grandma and pops are health freaks and when I went up to see them the night he pulls out the cannabis oil and tea bags

335 2018-08-27 23:06:45 sal·ad

336 2018-08-27 23:06:43 sal·ad

a mixture containing a specified ingredient served with a dressing.
337 2018-08-27 23:06:30 Not bad.

Guess crust is why I opt for home-made pizza bread (with store bought bread).  Similar method, except toss tomatoes in olive oil & spices, lay out on the bread, bake 25 min. @ 350, then add cheese, return to oven to melt & / or brown.
338 2018-08-27 23:06:09 Denmark is going in the wrong direction, and I've most Danish people I've spoken to aren't exactly happy about their country taking notes from the US. Denmark isn't socialist, it's social democrat. Or was. Venezuela would be okay because oil money, too, if the US hadn't embargoed
339 2018-08-27 23:05:45 It's not an open primary state but you can pick what you want to be for the vote. You ask for either a dem ballot or Republican ballot and can't cross ballot vote. If I'm a R but want to vote for some ds in primary I just ask for a D ballot. Can't vote for Rs though
340 2018-08-27 23:05:44 I’ve always meant to read his book ‘Hook Me Up Playa!’ about the evils of having an ever growing entourage and all the snake oil salesmen most young NBA players have to deal with.
341 2018-08-27 23:05:34 I'm just saying, team quit at half time its the mentality thing we have - we lose shape more often when we are leading than trailing. Either way Torino was about to score you can sense it Handanovic mistake is just more oil to the fire.
342 2018-08-27 23:05:29 i should really start sponsoring that nk argan oil lip gloss , i been recommending it allll day long .
343 2018-08-27 23:05:24 I’ve been using one— the veil primer from Hourglass!

If you mix primers just make sure they’re the same base. Like two oil based or two water based! :-) I haven’t done that in awhile..lemme think of which I used to mix 
344 2018-08-27 23:05:17 Heyyyy!!! Some good advice! It's true. Low-carb meat and vegetable diets are the way to go. You actually want good fatty foods for brain function. Cook with natural lard, sunflower seed oil etc. Studies show the diet helps autistic pro-develepment too
345 2018-08-27 23:04:53 They manipulated oil prices to hit Venezuela why wouldn't they do it another way? Dunno...
346 2018-08-27 23:04:51 old boots scrubbed n stripped of oil. drying outside. yay
347 2018-08-27 23:04:17 just successfully applied a cold wet paper towel to my hand after accidentally getting hot oil on it. think this makes me qualified to be a primary school nurse

351 2018-08-27 23:03:57 Sometimes the simplest meals made with the simplest ingredients are the best.

Tonight I sautéed chicken and broccoli, added a hot sauce/coconut oil mixture, and placed it over brown rice. 

SUCH A GOOD DINNER. 
352 2018-08-27 23:03:51 note to self: when eating food with sauce, eat less sauce. i know it tastes so good with rice, but the sauce holds all the oil, fat, and salt! my stomach is screaming at me rn 
353 2018-08-27 23:03:51 Hmm. Interesting that we export most of our oil when we import 97% of our supply - but I’ll take your word for it! Touché. Have a nice day.
354 2018-08-27 23:03:45 Pick an economic indicator and tell me again how the country is being taken down. 

Pick one. Any one. GDP. Wages. Unemployment across the board. New home sales. Job creation. Stock market. Trade deals. Oil production. Energy independence. Reduced taxes. Taxes taken in.

355 2018-08-27 23:03:38 Yeah 'ow' is super posh. I don't know anyone who speaks like that. Except mum on the phone. When I moved to Dublin for college the girls asked if I'd brought any teddies (it was a more innocent age). I kept telling them I'd brought an owl - oyull. They thought I'd brought oil.
356 2018-08-27 23:03:35 Now remember that I’m the one that was on stage with your owner when he asked if i could smell the extra Virgin in the olive oil. My comeback was quite clever.

361 2018-08-27 23:02:59 And yet you champion Trump, who is sulking and fuming over the accolades that McCain so richly deserves as a real American hero. Your words are soggy with snake oil. 
362 2018-08-27 23:02:43 Another promise kept. Unlike his snake oil salesman predecessor who broke all of his.
363 2018-08-27 23:02:29 a person who is 100% and strictly vegan can inflict a lot more harm on the environment than a person who is not vegan but makes conscious and realistic effort to eat less animal products, reduce plastic use whenever possible, avoid buying thjngs containing palm oil, etc.

415 2018-08-27 22:54:23 I’d really like to know why Cito oil’s, processed Cito oil’s, at these long-term negative consequences. I believe the statistics, but the question is why
416 2018-08-27 22:54:22 Hello, Ana. I am very sorry for feeling this way. It is difficult to live with #anxiety. I am wondering if you heard about #CBD oil. It is natural & helps for anxiety and many other conditions. Let me know if you are interested in. I can send you some info. I hope you feel better
417 2018-08-27 22:54:20 I use the entire range except the body oil as I don’t like the fragrance. The masks are like a facial. It’s unbelievable. I gasped the first time I looked in the mirror after using one.
418 2018-08-27 22:54:18 Oh yeah....untreated fibro too. Can't take Lyrica. Some gals here said to try that CBD oil, but it's expensive. I'm going to fight this though with all I've got. 
419 2018-08-27 22:54:10 #Brexiters who think it won't be so bad and business will cope  should cast their minds back to the fuel crisis during the early years of Blair gov. Then oil companies went out of their way to exacerbate the problem, to pressure the gov to change policy.
420 2018-08-27 22:54:07 Spring for the olive oil next time
Be better

422 2018-08-27 22:53:39 All Geographical Oil & Gas revenues go directly  to #ScotsGov not #WM. You need to check your own #SNP #ScotsGov website publications for the facts rather than making up nonsense. #Brexit will bring Scotland a lot more opportunities  & free up our depressed fishing industry.

424 2018-08-27 22:52:48 Hahaha. If you actually think we’re gonna be just as reliant on oil in 30 years as we are now then you’re absolute deluded. The industry, if smart, should be looking into future energy sources/technologies - with or without govt legislation put upon them. Get out of the 70’s!
425 2018-08-27 22:52:46 cant stand boys w dirty fingernails. was dating this boy who rides a motorcycle and his nails were always SO DISGUSTINGLY DIRTY, nigga always tried 2 finger me & id b like nahhhh my nigga, i dont need no fuckin oil change.

434 2018-08-27 22:51:18 Maaaad that I was driving my car with practically no oil left, so lucky to have checked it today
435 2018-08-27 22:51:18 Got my CBD oil today 
436 2018-08-27 22:51:12 And just so we're clear - Russia is nothing but a pissant 3rd world country w/oil & nukes, that could never beat Americans in a fair fight, so they are resorting to trolls & tricks. 

And Putin made a YUGE mistake to dare mess with AMERICA.

441 2018-08-27 22:50:45 The Ordinary's Rose Hip Oil is fantastic, and isn't "stepped on" as some of the brands out there (aka you can tell they're using quality oil). PRO TIP: mix it with 3 drops of The Ordinary's Sea Buckthorn Fruit Oil, and you will have goddess skin in a month...

444 2018-08-27 22:50:35 They have alot of bargain power ..we don't need your oil water wood ...can sell to China  and screw America
445 2018-08-27 22:50:08 Light degrades a variety of substances. IMHO, it sounds worth looking into. Especially if you are starting with a great olive oil, why let it deteriorate in front of your customers on their kitchen countertop. Sends wrong message to their friends aware of this issue..

448 2018-08-27 22:49:49 It's similar to the "Wizard of Oz" when the curtain gets pulled back and everyone sees the truth. Sorry morons you have been fooled by a snake oil salesman. You should be so proud of yourselves you sold out our Country
449 2018-08-27 22:49:48 We shouldn’t even care about the strait nor oil in the Middle East. Until we get it thru our thick skulls that it is NOT to our advantage to even try to work with islamic nutjob nations, we will continue to either kiss their behinds, endure terrorism or have ours killed in a war.

455 2018-08-27 22:49:02 Of course it’s international when it’s oil and you need it. No foreign US land is “international” because of resources. Kinda odd
456 2018-08-27 22:48:39 I stopped eating Oreos when it was shown the palm oil they use is not from sustainable sources, thus threatening even greater destruction of Orangutan habitats.

Not in any way funny or amusing I know.
457 2018-08-27 22:48:38 Getting my oil changed and saying no to all the add ons. I feel like I’m on super alert trying not to get tricked into anything and spending more than I should
458 2018-08-27 22:48:27 I doubt it's about oil , it is much deeper into the satanic culture of mobsters control! !!
459 2018-08-27 22:48:26 Dear Sir Jacob I have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil exploration in the sub-Sahara region......

However your choice to go after the most environmentally friendly sitting Senator on those grounds calls into question your motives.

478 2018-08-27 22:46:15 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

525 2018-08-27 22:39:49 Make sure they put a lot of oil in because last time I went to Valvoline they didn’t fill my oil up like at all and good thing I checked it cause there was non I’m lucky my car didn’t blow up. And they took air out of my tires not put any in. Never again lol
526 2018-08-27 22:39:43 Yes! Hispanic mother lol she normally frys the corn tortillas in oil on the stove to make the shells. The airfryer made them crunchy but not as crunchy as the oil but it totally worked! Just put the meat in ahead of time to help shape them

531 2018-08-27 22:38:51 same with cbd oil, except mine takes like a vanilla weed ice cream cone.
532 2018-08-27 22:38:47 Yes but it might hurt! Try rubbing breastmilk on them to soothe them and use coconut oil when you pump as a lubricant!
533 2018-08-27 22:38:46 I deep condition my hair with a diy avocado and olive oil mask. It has done wonders for my hair. I don't have to worry about my hair tangling as much anymore.
534 2018-08-27 22:38:26 Ok I wasn’t aware of such an extreme position. Which I don’t believe for a second but that’s because I’m paid by big oil and brain washed by Trump and also I’m a billionaire.
535 2018-08-27 22:38:25 Tomato and basil salad should be made with extra virgin olive oil and BALSAMIC vinegar. Not red wine vinegar.

539 2018-08-27 22:38:00 I had ramen for dinner (like corner store block ramen) flavored with garlic, soy bean oil, Chinese five spice, and threw in mushrooms, green onions, eggs, and chicken. Every time I forked chicken instead of mushroom, I was disappointed. 
540 2018-08-27 22:37:56 Why are you people so fixated on oil?
541 2018-08-27 22:37:41 Like the $36B cut to health care.  The reduction in Mental Health services, the limit on growth of health care, the raising of retirement age to 67.  Not to mention the growth of Oil prices (yes that happened on your watch)

548 2018-08-27 22:37:00 It’s possible $USO makes new highs producing negative divergence on secondary indicators (RSI/MACD). If we fail before then, a larger head and shoulders pattern on $CL_F has potential (86 summer driving) — right shoulder in progress. Either way, #oil goes higher from here.

561 2018-08-27 22:35:03 I have no clue I'm drunk. But I remember using LOTS of canola oil and bolillo and a Mexican brand of vegan American singles(?)

563 2018-08-27 22:34:49 hey could we just buy oil from venezuela, either that or maybe contribute to their gofundme for socialism page
564 2018-08-27 22:34:45 Ain’t nothing to do out there but work on oil rigs (while drunk) or just go out and drink according to my co worker that lived out there lol
565 2018-08-27 22:34:41 Time to check your oil buddy, your dipstick is dry!
566 2018-08-27 22:34:12 but that still is 42 days of solar energy hitting that square meter to equal it. 
the real issue is the background work done to concentrate solar energy into oil - millions of years of cumulative solar, vegetative, and platetechtonic work already invested.
567 2018-08-27 22:34:03 So move on without Canada. tRump is to stupid to know he alone can not cancel NAFTA. 500,000 jobs and billions of dollars are riding on his ridiculous bluff today. But , if the US goes, it goes. We can finally charge you for Electricity , Water and oil at free market prices.
568 2018-08-27 22:33:57 Mueller keeps drilling but he's never going to get oil!!!

572 2018-08-27 22:33:29 Where's the Federal Liberal Climate Plan your current plan is a no plan We need to stop all Pipelines & drilling for oil & gas now leave it in the ground - Canada must have a Climate Plan that reduces Global Warming - Do it now before it is too late to save all Life on our planet
573 2018-08-27 22:33:29 @McDonalds Can you tell me what your chips are coated in before being frozen? And tell me about the oil etc you use?

576 2018-08-27 22:33:21 So what would happen if I put vodka in my oil diffuser?
577 2018-08-27 22:33:10 Its been nasty either way, WM is an abuser not a benevolent neighbour. They still have that superiority of class & entitlement.The Elite have always been in power, their selfish & greedy. Would take us back to workhouses if given chance. Once we go they’ll have to change. No oil
578 2018-08-27 22:33:03 For this headline to come out on Iran controlling the strait OIL should be moving more mind you oil has been pricing in such an event for the last couple of months anyway...
579 2018-08-27 22:32:55 one cubic meter of sun-parallel sea-level earth surface receives 1000 W (1000 Joules per second) to do anything with that you have to concentrate it, which takes a lot of that energy.  One cubic meter of oil has  37080000000 joules (also paid for with wars, extraction, transport)
580 2018-08-27 22:32:52 The United States needs to sink every #Iranian ship that comes anywhere close to any of our oil supply or are navy vessels. #SinkThemAll
581 2018-08-27 22:32:48 I was the dark spot of oil

you faded
582 2018-08-27 22:32:29 Transforming Dinobot is way easier the second time...also, the shock oil helps.
583 2018-08-27 22:32:27 Another Southern Gentleman, fighting the Culture Wars, denying Global Warming, feathering his nest with oil and gas money.
584 2018-08-27 22:31:51 yo the fact that my oil change only $35 at my dealership is so clutch
585 2018-08-27 22:31:46 寒いんだかあついんだか

588 2018-08-27 22:31:24 What's wrong with mayo??? A good sub with mayo and oil and vinegar...yummy
589 2018-08-27 22:31:22 Holla, take a moment to learn about all the greenhouse gases it takes to get vegan foods to these areas, too.  The indirect impact to animals through fossil fuel use should be part of the analysis. Wildlife starve to death for oil and gas to be consumed by us.
590 2018-08-27 22:31:05 Do an apple cider vinegar rinse instead. Also make sure your styling products are silicone free and not too much protein (low-porosity hair doesn't like protein and it creates buildup) also I find coconut oil creates loads of build up on my low-por hair so I avoid it in products

593 2018-08-27 22:30:15 If at all the recent #KPA works and the reopening of the other oil production, dollar might drop. What will the government do to those that accumulated pounds into millions during this crisis?
594 2018-08-27 22:30:10 Nothing relevant to the oil field lol
595 2018-08-27 22:30:02 I think olive oil is better tasting and healthier! But canola is better for making popcorn and frying
596 2018-08-27 22:29:38 There are children bothering me mercilessly at this Walmart while I’m waiting to get an oil change. One keeps asking if I’m a grown up and what my kids’ names are, and the other keeps knocking on the window I’m facing away from to make me turn around but I’m not doing it.

598 2018-08-27 22:29:13 Are they planning to invade for our oil. They’ve never done that before have they?
Wait a minute. It all goes there now.
599 2018-08-27 22:29:10 It's a real brain fuck, I know, but words (or word roots, in this case) sometimes have multiple meanings. Oil is hydrophobic despite being incapable of fear.

601 2018-08-27 22:28:53 We had before Trump, the world's highest corporate taxation, and regulation that totally destroyed industries like coal mining and oil exploration in many areas. Billion, if not Trillion dollar industries gone. Both  hurt overhead, and inflation didn't help.
602 2018-08-27 22:28:49 Olive oil is a scam whereby people confuse their love of Italian restaurants with nutritional science (olive is good but canola is better value)

611 2018-08-27 22:27:36 Informe UBS: Additional US sanctions are reportedly in the pipeline, this time blocking the sale of oil processing products by US companies to Venezuela, which would further cripple Venezuela's oil sector.

617 2018-08-27 22:26:42 Informe UBS:  The recently proposed economic changes by the Maduro administration will fail to stabilize the country's macro dynamics or its oil production decline, in our view. Furthermore, these measures risk destabilizing social dynamics and could lead to more severe tensions

Yet they are starving due to their socialism.

637 2018-08-27 22:24:29 Canada needs to raise the costs of water, oil and electricity exports to the USA. I like America. Always have.

Tick Tock. Tick Tock.
638 2018-08-27 22:24:22 You still haven't won in Europe, are way behind even Villa for total trophy haul, and are running off oil money. When the oil dries up, then we'll see what you're made of.

660 2018-08-27 22:21:51 Not ludicrous at all.  Oil industry doesn't care about being sustainable, but profit.  Even more so when there isn't a care for they're own Motherland, because it isn't.   I'd recommend "Under rich Earth" because no, the destruction of my land wasn't an accident but treason.
661 2018-08-27 22:21:38 Yes, definitely not coconut oil since we know that's poisonous now
662 2018-08-27 22:21:37 I hope this is the shot they use for his Presidential oil painting.

667 2018-08-27 22:20:44 All very good points Max. It is frustrating with all the virtue signaling. If it were a real issue for the libs, then we would be importing 0 oil from KSA.

The difference between our meteoric rise( banked by Roman) and City's slow and cumbersome rise ( Arab oil) to the top is

This is proof that True Federalism is possible and workable. We do not all have to depend on oil for survival. Other states should learn from Kebbi.

730 2018-08-27 22:12:48 Or transmission oil
731 2018-08-27 22:12:47 Yeah, but that doesn’t really matter. The goal in Alberta isn’t to effectively reduce emissions: it’s to reduce emissions from all sources that aren’t the oil and gas industry.

792 2018-08-27 22:03:34 Aid and comfort with low yield nukes and INF research to match their capabilities?  Sanctions,strengthening NATO and putting more troops in eastern Europe?

801 2018-08-27 22:02:04 Also in India, some folks are saying no aid should be sent to Kerala of the Muslim and Christians there. Their sin?  So I suppose the Christian west should have sent no aid to India because the primary beneficiaries were Hindus. And we should buy no Arab oil or western imports.

853 2018-08-27 21:55:39 While oil prices contributed largely to Nigeria's recession crisis, our export slow growth, forex pressures, and CBN's maintenance of MPR at 14% was arguably what pushed us further into the trenches of recession.

The current oil growth only contributed about 8.5% to Nigeria's GDP as at June, with our production lagging behind by about 0.14 million barrels PER DAY. Key in other factors and you would see why we've not experienced growth

889 2018-08-27 21:50:26 I've just been dropping low-key "well, of course it all needs to stay in the ground really, doesn't it?" into any discussions at work pertaining to the oil sector. Maybe I need to level up to lapel grabbing

Buying past it players is the polar opposite of Ashley's strategy, and Abramovich didn't invest £1bn into Chelsea he donated it - blood money made from violence, bribery and stripping oil and aluminium from Russia. How can he possibly be held up as a role model?

920 2018-08-27 21:46:20 Yes & no.  The US did intervene to support EUR in early days when it was very weak.  The US also "intervened" shortly after a major global oil exporter decided to "help reduce the strength of the USD" a little later by moving all his oil exports & oil surpluses into EUR.
921 2018-08-27 21:46:07 Oh well. Boo Hoo. Live and let live. Obama played golf when there was a huge oil spill in the Gulf. Of course, he was also the WORST president in U.S. history.

951 2018-08-27 21:41:12 I haven’t read this article, because ruetuers..
But the answer to why is simple.
They would have to bring in 3rd party verification for their seriously exaggerated oil reserves. Being a member of OPEC they self report, plus output quotas are based on those self reported reserves.
952 2018-08-27 21:40:56 hey @ChristinaP coconut oil for your bum bum. Seriously. And a sitz bath would help

975 2018-08-27 21:37:54 Canada, especially in the oil department, has been getting screwed by NAFTA for a long time. Our international export here in Canada is smiling in wake of the trade war. About time Canada stands up to the southern bully.

Now running away from much of their ‘left lean’ as immigration & welfare has muddied the waters & caused many to elect ‘not to work’.  Again, nanny state taking away proper incentives.

988 2018-08-27 21:35:25 Bad example and you know it.  First, until recently a very homogenous populace. Second, huge oil reserves. and now with unchecked immigration, they are moving away from their lean to the left - too many able-bodied electing not to work.  It was a nice ride but Oil will run out.

1003 2018-08-27 21:33:15 There are already cleaner sources and they could give it to everyone for free. Nikolai Tesla created it but again big business is what controls the earth. Our oil reserves in the US are almost virtually untouched. So oil will not be gone for a long time. I agree with you though.

1014 2018-08-27 21:32:13 Diet made simple... 

Water instead of soda: good.

Whole grains instead of refined grains: good.

Nuts, seeds, olive oil, avocado: good.

Fish and seafood in the place of meat: good.

In other words, an “anti-inflammatory” diet is a good diet.

Algae is promising for biofuel. Grown in tanks at a much higher density than farm land.
Fields can produce more than one crop per year. Plants like mustard take 90 days to maturity. That's 4 crops per year.
How many acres do oil wells and production tie up?

3. Creates jobs directly & indirectly.

1127 2018-08-27 21:16:49 New diet plan called the peasant diet: each family gets one loaf of bread, 4 potatoes, 1cup of butter, and 1cup of olive oil that they share over the course of 1 week. It is promised to get you as skinny as the children in Les Mis.
1128 2018-08-27 21:16:44 What if I only have coconut oil? I have that but no lavender.
1129 2018-08-27 21:16:33 Then he goes sprinkle some vegetable oil 
1130 2018-08-27 21:16:31 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
1131 2018-08-27 21:16:28 I forgot how messy hot oil treatments are, I got oil literally everywhere 
1132 2018-08-27 21:15:40 Ok, got my own crib now, gotta start doing my own oil changes lol
1133 2018-08-27 21:15:15 .... may/may not, depending on oil prices and output
1134 2018-08-27 21:15:10 Episode 208 of Halt and Catch Fire, Limbo, effectively communicates how hard it is to regain trust. When the exploitative suits at the oil company copy Mutiny, then shut the actual Mutiny down, everoyne blames Joe, who stumbles in on drugs and tries to explain that he's not...

1137 2018-08-27 21:14:50 Excess oil revenue rises to $58m per day as price hits $76 per barrel
1138 2018-08-27 21:14:37 Well, it's your opinion & you have a right to it, some of the people you are complaining abt did what they did based on conviction bc of the pedigree of the fmr administration of Don fortunato or haven't you heard of the "oil biz is very oily" statement GEJ made to SP Saraki?
1139 2018-08-27 21:14:33 Est-ce qu'il y a un lien pour écouter en différé? Suis curieux de connaître ce qu'il est encore possible de faire

1147 2018-08-27 21:13:38 Just spent the past hour on the kitchen floor cleaning up broken glass & olive oil from a full bottle which hurled itself at me as I opened the cupboard. Not a great way to spend your Monday evening, but on the plus side I now have really soft hands 
1148 2018-08-27 21:13:25 Me and Karlee are supposed to be getting chinese in like .23 seconds and my oil change is taking FOREVER.
1149 2018-08-27 21:13:11 Has anyone ever gone in for an oil change and NOT had to buy half a new engine to get out of there?
1150 2018-08-27 21:13:06 One of the leading oil lobbyists said it is "encouraged" by news that the Trump administration has reached an agreement with Mexico to update the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
1151 2018-08-27 21:13:01 What oil do you use?
1152 2018-08-27 21:13:01 Per @SCBroncos, '98 F Kole Gable is joining his hometown Fort McMurray Oil Barons, with whom he played at the Western Canada Cup before embarking on a 166-game #WHL career. #AJHL
1153 2018-08-27 21:12:57 I hear their oil reserves are also dwindling, plus they face a future financial crisis....

1156 2018-08-27 21:12:12 The rate at which MU is going down, they will soon stop discover OIL
1157 2018-08-27 21:12:07 So for now, I only bust out glasses and cardstock for bees, wasps and moths whose wings I don't want to fuck up with my human skin oil fingers.
1158 2018-08-27 21:12:01 canada needs to start selling their oil to the china and the india
1159 2018-08-27 21:12:00 The oil rinse is done mid wash, shampoo and rinse then coat your hair with oil, conditioner and let it sit. Rinse out. I do that every few washes
1160 2018-08-27 21:11:41 Ran out of #butter today. None to be found in shops so reluctantly got some spreadable, Lurpak. When eaten, it was like watery dandelion juice on the tongue. YUK. Have they changed ingredients (more oil) ? Its 50% butter yet costs more. Cannot go back to this spreadable crap!
1161 2018-08-27 21:11:41 @Peta this looks good, what do you suggest as a side? I mean you all eat Veggies? Is French Fries cooked in Oil Good? A Salad? I mean asking the experts, since all you guys eat are the side dish to any main meal.
1162 2018-08-27 21:11:40 Muhammed Buhari died since 2016 . But evil Britain  continues the use of the lifeless body to kill Biafrans because of our oil.

1166 2018-08-27 21:11:16 สนใจครับ
1167 2018-08-27 21:11:11 Just have to wonder if an incorrect forecast does more damage then no guess. Assume this is the basis of yesterday's graph showing market oversupply of 0.9 mmb/d in 2019. Decisions based on that oversupply picture such as continued limited oil E&P spend could make things worse.
1168 2018-08-27 21:11:07 Except that Trump also removed exemptions and credits for solar energy (which employs more US workers than oil and gas) while keeping and increasing them for fossil fuels.
1169 2018-08-27 21:10:47 Got out of work at 3:30pm, got oil in my car, dishes are done, cooking dinner for Mr. P, and then making myself dinner 
1170 2018-08-27 21:10:47 That's Trump's modus operandi. Makes problem where none exists, promises better result but same old crap in the end after months of BS. But MAGA loves his being a biz man even though he's at least 6 bankruptcies & still counting. Want some snake oil? He's your guy!
1171 2018-08-27 21:10:46 No you don’t rinse it out lol. It’s done post wash. The Liquid is water, Oil your ends (not your roots or else it’ll be flat and greasy) and finally Cream (LOC), it seals the moisture from the water in
1172 2018-08-27 21:10:44 I thought it was soy for me too because it was very prominent in my diet when my skin was really bad but since I’ve been eating Mostly Whole Foods and cut out oil my skin has been doing good and I still eat tofu, tempeh, edamame and other soy products.
1173 2018-08-27 21:10:42 400+
1174 2018-08-27 21:10:39 You will never go back now! Once you start using oil it’s never the same with out it!
1175 2018-08-27 21:10:32 Wash your face with African black soap, apply witch hazel then a moisturizer then vitamin e oil. In that order, every other day (use moisturizer and witch hazel everyday, i typically do witch hazel and moisturizer in the morning). Thank me later!!!

1194 2018-08-27 21:07:13 Whatever the mechanism, the solution to resolving climate change will only succeed if the major oil&gas companies are on-board. They are the only world-wide organisations with the scale and capability to do what's required.

To coin a phrase, we need them in the tent pissing out.
1195 2018-08-27 21:07:08 I don't think it's unsustainable as such. UK had a deficit/GDP averaged 8% from 2009 to 2013. Almost all countries operate with a deficit. Very few operate a surplus.. just countries like Norway with massive oil and gas resources... wait

1202 2018-08-27 21:05:52 Don't let these "high end" razors or shaving clubs fool you - I've used the same razor 46 times. It's all about using the right products and using a pre-shave oil is key. I haven't cut myself since using it and have a smooth face every time.

1212 2018-08-27 21:04:03 You are involved. You're the most corrupt of all and up to your neck on oil investigation.
1213 2018-08-27 21:03:58 Neither Japan or the US wanted war with each other, Japan needed oil, we stood in their way, our government knew it was a matter of time, the only way to get Americans behind a war effort was to allow Japan to attack pearl, the rest of the war was straight forward, no conspiracy

1215 2018-08-27 21:03:30 On that note, when wood windows are replaced by wood they are treated with substandard paints that flake soon after installation & the rot sets in again. I imagine oil paints are not allowed due to off-gassing so the TDSB could look to linseed oil alternatives such as Allback.

1223 2018-08-27 21:01:10 We need strong leader ship! If we had pipelines and refineries it wouldn’t matter what the US Did. This country should be energy self-sufficient and the fact that it isn’t is a disgrace! Who is making a bundle? Why are we buying or oil from despotic regimes?

1233 2018-08-27 20:59:54 And what about long distance lorry drivers or on the men and women working on oil rigs over Christmas? Nobody asks them why they do it. Their answers are probably the same and nobody cares. If you don't practice your religion then are you religious or just spiritual?
1234 2018-08-27 20:59:50 @MarksnSpence brought a millionaires shortbread today. Looking at ingredients I notice it contained palm oil.  Why is this used? Other supermarkets are stopping its use. I put it back.

What type of sword do you prefer,  broad or something smaller so you can carry a shield?
1238 2018-08-27 20:59:36 The math says it not even 0.07% of oil production. Clearly you are wrong.

1260 2018-08-27 20:55:40 yeah. that looks like nice oil.
1261 2018-08-27 20:55:37 Do you know how much investment it takes to extract oil and other mineral resources from the ground? Do you know how difficult it is? They're not just barging their way in with shovels and digging it up. Private companies invest hundreds of millions before they see a profit.
1262 2018-08-27 20:55:25 It is time for our state to invest in clean energy long-term jobs that support coastal communities & inland communities. Wave energy solar wind Hydro invest in these jobs TAX the OIL Companies stop corporate welfare use the taxes to build homes & schools that are affordable!
1263 2018-08-27 20:55:20 Unfortunately that will only happen if some rich Oil baron comes in.

1268 2018-08-27 20:55:05 Did I say that? Still doesn’t change the fact that oil is a dying industry. Also PS Tesla isn’t the only company to make electric cars. Ford, Honda, Nissan all have electric or hybrid options
1269 2018-08-27 20:55:03 For the past 10 years it has smelled like burnt oil outside of Walgreens

This place was dark, not an inch of light could be shown. But a faint smell of oil lingered in the air, with Saito's keen sense of smell she would hold out >>
1272 2018-08-27 20:54:19 Too Little Too Late!  We got to see the true nature of this pitiful, spiteful snake oil salesman POS. This POTUS pettiness knows no limit. As a VET I am livid he did this.  He has no grounds to say ANYTHING to NFL Players. F*&^ HIM! @realDonaldTrump #halfmast

1278 2018-08-27 20:53:43 Was for a new dish.  Cut cucumber into pieces with knife at 45 degrees to axis, rotating the gourd whilst doing so. Lightly fry chopped onions & garlic in olive oil, then add cuke pieces plus pepper and cover to steam.  Serve with tabasco. Physics students do this sort of thing.

1289 2018-08-27 20:52:06 Like no Steve I just want an oil change
1290 2018-08-27 20:51:58 For god’s sake people, if you’re going to deep fry savoury things, you have to salt them as soon as they come out of the oil. Don’t be lame. The salt just rolls off of the cooled stuff. Season while the pores are open!!
1291 2018-08-27 20:51:56 Yeah, he loved America so much he conspired & helped murder millions of ppl & commit war crimes again & again into his elderly years for monetary gain & to promote the evil agenda of NWO psychopathic globalist bankers & oil tycoons. Honor? Pfftt!
1292 2018-08-27 20:51:56 And the world has been destabilized, by war, in the endless pursuit if oil to put money in the pockets of ridiculously rich capitalists.

1302 2018-08-27 20:50:43 Sell all the Manchester united players. End the contract of Woodward. Have the owners sell the club to an oil fuck willing to spend. And most importantly give Jose more money to spend. Good night.
1303 2018-08-27 20:50:29 Choice is not bad per se...except for when it comes to the USD's monopoly on the pricing of oil & other commodities.  Then choice is bad...for the USD.
1304 2018-08-27 20:50:20 The WMD bs was a lie. Dick Cheney helped Halliburton Stock quadruple with the Iraq war. So don't tell me oil had nothing to do with it. Saddam, as bad as he was, if he was still in power, ISIS would never have even formed. ISIS' rise to power is a direct result of that war
1305 2018-08-27 20:50:18 Keep your eye on oil. Doubt this goes unanswered by the president.

1311 2018-08-27 20:49:24 Perhaps... US currently consuming about 40% CDN oil. NAFTA just ensured that supply had to flow as needed. Canada will have greater energy security. I wouldn’t want to rely on Saudi Arabia in a time of need but I guess times have changed and the US doesn’t need allies any longer.

1318 2018-08-27 20:48:34 As usual, them talk oil and gas but you dey talk using fire wood. Come on nau. The point is that EPL tough gan and it is obvious but you think La Liga is better? That's fine but stats no really back you up.
1319 2018-08-27 20:48:29 What deaths does capitalism cause? too many to list here. Start with slave trade..deregulations of environmental safeguards, protecting interests of oil barons in literal warfare (War is always about money). latest example is Trump allowing toxic coal sludge into  riverways.

1333 2018-08-27 20:46:37 This is what happens when you destroy an economy thru socialism and communism. Both discourage not just work but also investment and innovation. Both encourage a two class system the rich and the poor. Oil rich country can't drill wells for drinking water for all.

1339 2018-08-27 20:45:59 The US dollar is the only currency with which one can do large scale purchases of oil. Without dollars you can't trade. The US under the bush administration did something similar to online gambling companies outside of the US in 2006.
1340 2018-08-27 20:45:49 People really out here swishing coconut oil instead of brushing their teeth
1341 2018-08-27 20:45:48 "At the height of Venezuela’s spending spree, in 2011, Caracas gave Managua $557 billion worth of subsidized oil."

There is no way that number is accurate. $557 million sounds more plausible.

1343 2018-08-27 20:45:45 Why the US protects SaudiA?
-Oil fields are world’s biggest & least costly to extract 
-Fields are in sparsely populated Shi'ite East province
-Easy to control an absolute king
-Shi’ite Iran+Iraq enemies & own Shi’ite citizens drive king to pay big $ for US protection

1355 2018-08-27 20:43:39 I put 0.4g of sublimed C60 to 500ml of olive oil. The filter is like 1/16" too large for the funnel. So it's getting wavy if I blow it to the bottom. If I push it with my fingers, 1/16" of the filter is getting folded.

1357 2018-08-27 20:43:12 I bought boiled groundnuts today, so much of it around, and it is so cheap. In season now.

Peanuts are a substitute for Soya - high protein, and oil too.

But to sell this stuff to China - who really needs it, we need infrastructure - which we don't have.
1358 2018-08-27 20:43:08 yeah and I know thta crude oil comes from the ground, but it seems like if you put a oil mule in that tepid mass of meat you'd probably get something you could power a car with.

1374 2018-08-27 20:41:04 I suspect the greed for oil profits put the brakes on any real development into carbon free propulsion development, so using your analysis, the oil companies should anti up the money to clean up this mess, and what about world governments ?

1383 2018-08-27 20:40:07 Just some napkin math, but Bitcoin mining isn't even close to 1% of the world's energy consumption yet: 

95 MM boe produced daily, 6.12 GJ of energy per BOE = 581 e6 GJ

Mining consumption is approx 5 gigawatt today = 432 e3 GJ

Bitcoin mining < 0.07% of oil industry...

1411 2018-08-27 20:36:36 Reducing oil import is the only way for bangladesh to make some extra money for the long run I think we spend at least few billions dollar to import crude oil ...

1421 2018-08-27 20:35:02 Does that mean a military movie directly caused people to die?  Of course not.  But it does contribute to a culture that supports Imperialism, and that culture underlies real life events like the oil wars.
1422 2018-08-27 20:34:52 That’s terrible! Have you considered CBD oil in addition to treatment?

1424 2018-08-27 20:34:33 Sometimes I want to eat straight up coconut oil. Just out of the jar
1425 2018-08-27 20:34:32 @Newsweek is now printing the exact opposite of truth. Lets go through today's stories. 

Coconut Oil is "pure poison" says Harvard "professor".
Arsenic could help with cancer. 
Vaping could raise risk of cancer.

Looks like "Newsweek" doesn't want Americans healthy.
1426 2018-08-27 20:34:23 For my skin essential lavender oil seems a magic exfoliant.
1427 2018-08-27 20:34:20 Seriously?! We’re talking about the same that’s screwed up our own oil and gas industry so badly?!  The @JustinTrudeau government couldn’t organize a bachelor party at a whore house.

1433 2018-08-27 20:33:46 Have you thought about using CBD oil in addition to the radiation treatment?
1434 2018-08-27 20:33:39 From 204 to 2013 Venezuela got so much oil money that it would have been impossible not producing a sense of improvement in the country. It is a testament to Chavez mismanagement and corruption that such improvement went away almost immediately after he died.
1435 2018-08-27 20:33:36 bs we still have Troops in Iraq. It never ended. The time to pull out troops would have never come if Republicans have their way. They want to stay there until the oil runs dry. As far as Bill Clinton goes, there were no signs of a recession back then. Left office with a surplus.

1439 2018-08-27 20:33:10 Your living here driving or riding in oil consuming vehicles, cooking  food, washing your body, clothes, floors that were heated by oil consuming appliances! Even the electricity U use to charge the device your tweeting from used oil to produce it in some way! Hypocritical much?
1440 2018-08-27 20:33:07 Dermalogica agesmart primer is really nice for oily skin it’s like $60 but I carry it so I get a p good discount, rodials airbrush primer is good too it’s for combo skin but it controlled my excess oil problem on my nose.

1455 2018-08-27 20:31:17 It’s a credit line Tehran provided Damascus back in 2013 as Syria’s oil production plummeted. Back in 2012, Iran (in sanctions) was BUYING oil from Syria to resell.

1512 2018-08-27 20:23:28 Your evidence that she’s a fraud rests in the fact that she changed her worldview therefore she’s a snake oil saleswoman peddling theories she doesn’t actually believe in order to line her pockets. She changed her mind so she’s a charlatan. Your argument is a real winner.
1513 2018-08-27 20:23:27 a little baby oil might help, of course it'll also make it a bit greasy...so you gotta be careful

crushed to make wine

• Diamonds form
under pressure

• Olives are pressed to
release oil

• Seeds grow in
darkness

Whenever you feel crushed, under pressure, pressed, or in darkness, you’re in a powerful place of transformation/transmutation.

1623 2018-08-27 20:07:14 Not entirely true. 
Canola was grown as rapeseed from the 1500s. It was heavily MARKETED in the 70s, because the oil makes a great industrial lubricant. 

And margarine. 

which is why I don’t eat margarine.

1645 2018-08-27 20:04:22 We used to do it for the sake of freedom, and democracy! That is until we went into Iraq. That was all about money, and oil. So you are correct there. How can you say we always did it for money? We didn't want to get into WW1, or WW11. The Japanese bombed us while in peace talks.

1675 2018-08-27 20:01:18 Yeah I get that but looking to the next few years, vehicle manufacturers are full steam ahead( no pun) with electric vehicles which will reduce oil consumption. Also I'm sure the renewables sector will have an effect too.
1676 2018-08-27 20:01:01 accidentally spilled hot oil all over my foot while making dumplings so ironically now i’m using the dumplings package as an ice pack

1682 2018-08-27 20:00:17 I always do the right thing no matter the consequence. Let him have oil!
1683 2018-08-27 20:00:13 Talk about nearsighted cost savings. Are they expecting another 50 years of paying for oil instead of natural gas? $$$$$$$$
1684 2018-08-27 20:00:12 Come in for a 40.00 oil change leave out with a 1400.00 estimate.... Lawd knows I hate doing car stuff... where my Mr. at
1685 2018-08-27 20:00:10 USA loves the we get from them for selling them our bombs and other weapons. Yes and we love the oil. You will get your colleagues to put real pressure on the Saudi regime when we transition to a green economy.
1686 2018-08-27 19:59:58 I thought I lost my keys again, nope the people have it. Bc I am literally getting an oil change. Why am I like this ? 
1687 2018-08-27 19:59:51 Nothing wrong with a bath. As long as you shower the shit you sat in off! Baby oil helps keep the grim away too.
1688 2018-08-27 19:59:35 @createcultivate gift bag was pretty lit. Tried the #goodgenes by @sundayriley and I’m glad the Sephora sale is coming up because I needs it in my routine. Love it. The UFO oil didn’t work for me but the lactic acid in the good genes make me excited to invest in a full size
1689 2018-08-27 19:59:06 The largest and longest placebo-controlled randomized trial of omega-3 fatty acid (as found in fish oil) supplementation has found no effect on serious vascular events, cancer, or mortality. (The ASCEND Trial. ESC 2018)
1690 2018-08-27 19:58:53 I little varnish mixed into some oil stain gives the stain a little shine and a little longer life.

1692 2018-08-27 19:58:37 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
1693 2018-08-27 19:58:28 Hey oil painters... how do you get rid of your solvents?

1696 2018-08-27 19:57:47 Judges are lawyers in robes.  That black robe doesn't anoint a lawyer in Constitutional Teflon oil.
1697 2018-08-27 19:57:46 Isn't the general rule of thumb don't use oil based lube with latex condoms? That might be the only part of sex Ed I remember, well that & I don't like cock & apparently the average man is smaller than I thought he would be.
1698 2018-08-27 19:57:41 Why??!  He’s a snake oil con artist. IRS alone would have a field day with this self promoting ass.  The SEC should be ashamed and investigate itself.
1699 2018-08-27 19:57:41 Also what kind of car, my car takes an oil change every 10k miles..
1700 2018-08-27 19:57:26 I actually love the smell of palm oil and crayfish when cooking. My whole house smells of it now because of the sweet potato and plantain pottage I cooked. Also the spinach I bought wasn’t nearly enough 
1701 2018-08-27 19:57:25 Coconut oil 
1702 2018-08-27 19:57:01 I’ve added Tamanu oil into my skin routine for the occasional break outs. The oil should come with a warning about the smell though.
1703 2018-08-27 19:57:00 I need oil prices to skyrocket in 3 years.
1704 2018-08-27 19:56:48 I can pay for that with my taxes too instead of directly subsidizing oil companies with them. If you actually read the article you’d know that the oil corps have used their influence to discredit environmental concerns, and to obfuscate the damage they’re responsible for.
1705 2018-08-27 19:56:48 1 lak 42 thousand 203 crore Rs of Oil bonds issued in just 4 years by UPA2. Isn't that scam for showing #Udhaar_ka_vikas
1706 2018-08-27 19:56:30 If you're thinking of a variety of tomato to grow next year, I recommend Purple Cherokee. Really sweet, juicy and tasty with lovely creamy texture. Add fresh mozzarella, good olive oil, a bit of very good balsamic vinegar and shredded basil and you're laughing all summer long
1707 2018-08-27 19:56:30 The best kind of research, i know that weight gain power has more carbohydrates and muscle mass stuff, to gain fat simple sugars, oils and trans fats and animal and vegetable fats are what you want peanut oil and lard are prime examples
1708 2018-08-27 19:56:29 I need to get up and do a hot oil treatment
1709 2018-08-27 19:56:12 All the years of trouble with Iran, starting with the Carter years,  that some general in the US Defense Dept did not look for alternate ways to ship oil not thru the Strait of Hormuz, but with a pipeline from Ra al Kaimah to Al Fujairah in northwest UAE to the Arabian sea.
1710 2018-08-27 19:56:09 @younglivingeo what 5ml diffusable oil is closest to the scent of relaxation?
1711 2018-08-27 19:56:06 And again the DNC is a joke. Making rigging primaries great again and taking big oil money.
1712 2018-08-27 19:56:03 yeah .. but I doubt the international community will do anything.. most are balls deep in Saudi oil money they don't have their own senses anymore.
1713 2018-08-27 19:55:59 IMPORTANT MESSAGE: I suffer from muscle spasms, insomnia and wicked restless leg syndrome. I purchased some high grade cannabis oil from a Long Beach dispensary and am so happy with the results. So far, three nights of great sleep and no kicking!
1714 2018-08-27 19:55:49 Russia is nothing but a 3rd world country w/oil & nukes, that knows it can NEVER beat Americans in a fair fight, and so has to resort to trolls & trickery. 

Putin & his Troll Army have made MANY enemies - and we will NOT forget Russia's dishonorable conduct. 
1715 2018-08-27 19:55:46 You would think that. Some of us want England to stand on its own feet and to stop bleeding Scotland dry of Gas, Oil and Whisky etc. Independence is coming and independence is NORMAL  #Brexit #ScotRef #IndyRef2 #WakeUpScotland
1716 2018-08-27 19:55:43 World oil demand 2060?
1717 2018-08-27 19:55:32 Lol. Mine is Young oil change 
1718 2018-08-27 19:55:30 Are you passing out coconut oil 
1719 2018-08-27 19:55:25 Do you happen to know where I can purchase the oil?
1720 2018-08-27 19:54:52 The light should turn on when you need it. Mine tells me maintenance required. Try to use synthetic oil that way you don't have to do it until around 5,000 miles. It should be turning on soon.
1721 2018-08-27 19:54:26 I’ve heard coconut oil can be used? X
1722 2018-08-27 19:54:25 for straight oil you just drop it under your tongue. i mostly drink cbd water now though.

1727 2018-08-27 19:53:41 I'm a teacher. I have family that works for oil companies. No one is a perfect candidate, but I'd take him and his track record over Stitt any day!!
1728 2018-08-27 19:53:35 Told Reka I’m coming over to wash clothes, take naps and for her to oil my scalp and she replies “the door unlocked”... Real friends!
1729 2018-08-27 19:53:32 Alexa, play some bottle of oil!
1730 2018-08-27 19:53:17 Oh yeh I get you. Question though.. who should be held responsible for environmental damage and luck of revenue to the local communtiy the oil company or the MoP and it's partners ?
1731 2018-08-27 19:53:15 To make the oil or before I die?
1732 2018-08-27 19:53:15 Well, it's back down now.

1734 2018-08-27 19:53:06 I went and paid $40 for an oil change forgetting that I work at KMART so I get a sears discount and could’ve paid $5 for my oil change instead 
1735 2018-08-27 19:53:01 Had to prepay for our first oil home delivery.  Yikes, super $$$
1736 2018-08-27 19:52:56 @AutoNation @CEOMikeJackson I had an appt for an oil change today the Austin location and was told it would be 3 hrs before it could be started and loaners weren’t for oil changes.  Is this really how things go for customers at AutoNation?  Seems pretty awful.
1737 2018-08-27 19:52:50 Is it not the case that current policy (both Scottish and UK Government) is to intervene to slow the continuing decline of the Oil & Gas sector as much as possible?
1738 2018-08-27 19:52:37 Getting my oil changed... and still need my left tail light fixed but can’t take it in till Wednesday, and I need to register my car here in Kansas by Friday #shittingmoneyidonthave

1740 2018-08-27 19:52:29 I’m getting an oil change at a place that has you stay in your car (it’s too hot out for this) and the guy changing my oil is scream singing some rap song?

1744 2018-08-27 19:51:54 Sometimes I worry about where the oil industry gets its people from
1745 2018-08-27 19:51:51 Jerry Brown pushed Cal Coast off from billions of tax revenue because he is such an odor. FYI I own an Oil Company.
1746 2018-08-27 19:51:36 My poor car is finally getting its oil changed at the Boujee Toyota

1749 2018-08-27 19:51:02 Excess oil revenue rises to $58m per day as price hits $76 per barrel
1750 2018-08-27 19:50:44 How many Syrian friends do you have? Must either have family living in Syria or themselves living in Syria, tell me?
Assad's government was ELECTED in 2008 and this whole shitshow is about an oil pipeline and Israeli motives.
Only terrorists killing people in Syria.

1754 2018-08-27 19:50:22 lollllll...
let me burst your bubble, 
one sack of lime rind would not give you a bottle of lime oil. 

and do you know how expensive it is?
1755 2018-08-27 19:50:22 A little hedge doesn't hurt...besides that Iran is still being assholes over in the straits...if only You buggers would stick to Canadian Oil...
1756 2018-08-27 19:50:20 You don't have any understanding of the Venezuelan economic crisis apparently. A country that relied on oil alone for over 90% of their countries income suffered mightily with the drop in oil prices.
Inflation skyrockets, wages do not. Sounding at all familiar yet?
1757 2018-08-27 19:50:15 oils are also the perfect thing to use on her scalp to keep the rest of her hair healthy and with that you have to just find which ones work best for her almond and olive oil are my personal fav.
1758 2018-08-27 19:50:13 Because even people in the oil business will tell you that the only reason that they ever went to Dee was because Obama push them out of coastal waters.
1759 2018-08-27 19:50:02 me: oh i see carrots, cabbage, noodles, and oil for frying. is mom making eggrolls soon?

me: no wait I helped mom grind up pork for eggrolls of course she's making them soon
1760 2018-08-27 19:49:58 Have you tried Moroccan argan oil? I have a huge issue with my hair and humidity and find the argan oil helps a lot.
1761 2018-08-27 19:49:30 Uhm, I can’t say for certain there is a light for the oil change. If that comes on i believe ur fucked lol. You can take it in and see if they recommend you getting it done now or at a later date. Also, check ur user manual & see if the oil light is an indicator to get it done
1762 2018-08-27 19:49:29 Lmfaoo dats u off the oil 
1763 2018-08-27 19:49:22 That’s because of the oil boom out there tho right?  Dallas and Houston both cheaper than that..
1764 2018-08-27 19:49:21 I took my hair down from twisties 2 days ago. I washed my hair, had a hot oil treatment, blowed dryed&pressed it. I bought some Black Caster Oil, Cactus Oil Serem, Cactus Gro, Wild Growth hair, Argan&Vitamin E oil 2 hopefully help my hair grow back where it's thinning. 
1765 2018-08-27 19:49:21 Pernah gune but its stripping away my natural oil. Then muke jadi ketat 
1766 2018-08-27 19:49:18 So what happens to these machines when they break down and no longer work? How do we dispose of them! What’s happens when they leak oil into the earth ( and they do) and also the birds that fly into them!

1776 2018-08-27 19:48:11 Why I can’t pull up & get my oil changed? All that waiting be blowing it dawg
1777 2018-08-27 19:47:50 Oil companies don’t supply a product no one wants. In this case we need it to live, sadly. So instead of crying about oil companies maybe people should stop using their products and take personal responsibility. How many trees is @MikeHudema planting? Oil co.s plant tons.
1778 2018-08-27 19:47:50 Drain that fags oil
1779 2018-08-27 19:47:46 I don’t drive often and I just hit 3k miles, but shouldn’t the oil change notification come on?

1786 2018-08-27 19:46:04 You can buy cook books solely for them.  Can make bread, cakes etc as well.   Will try roast potatoes.  I make great roast potatoes, but very oil intensive, so very unhealthy. 
1787 2018-08-27 19:46:01 There are set of ruled which players need to fulfil in order to play with another nation. It is obvious that those rules were either relaxed or breached in #AsianGames2018 to benefit oil rich Middle East nations.

1792 2018-08-27 19:45:04 You made a couple of big forehead comments in the past. My long Ted Nugent style locks developed a bald spot. Seems like Rosemary Essential oil mixed with a carrier oil will keep hair line in check and reverse loss.
1793 2018-08-27 19:44:58 My work desk is pretty bare. Because it’s small. I do have a windowsill next to me to get of make my space a little more fun. It has funko pop vinyls, a couple fake plants (lord knows I can’t keep any alive), an oil diffuser and wedding photo.

1800 2018-08-27 19:43:54 If science mattered to you, why have you disregarded the CCST report on the climate and health risks of oil drilling in communities, and acted as governor to expand oil drilling in CA by 20,000+ wells. In the era of climate catastrophe, actions matter too. #BrownsLastChance

1802 2018-08-27 19:43:51 This may sound dumb but how often are you suppose to get oil changes? I’ve had my car four months but it hasn’t come up yet.
1803 2018-08-27 19:43:49 Kwankwasiyya   Nice Avi @hayateey1
1804 2018-08-27 19:43:35 That was due to coal & oil whispering in his ear about how much $$$ they would give him.
1805 2018-08-27 19:43:26 Oh yea, keto has fully kicked in. I was hungry and ate a small tin of smoked oysters in oil and now I feel full. Now I just need winter to come so I can freeze myself and I'll be really cutting weight.
1806 2018-08-27 19:43:07 Oil change time
1807 2018-08-27 19:43:06 no regular motor oil should be uh, relatively safe, he just bought some toxic waste and mixed it in
1808 2018-08-27 19:43:01 cbd oil helps me so much with my anxiety and chronic pain tbh
1809 2018-08-27 19:42:42 クソジジイだから今起きた
1810 2018-08-27 19:42:36 Honestly homophobia is EVERYWHERE! I was at the pool and scratched my knee on the edge. Blatant homophobia. My oil change took 2 hours today! Homophobia again.
1811 2018-08-27 19:42:33 yeah some guy had a business where he'd spray it wherever to control dust, and then he mixed some toxic waste in with his regular used oil, then the county hired him for all the dirt roads!
1812 2018-08-27 19:42:33 I m already in kaduppu... Dnt add oil.
1813 2018-08-27 19:42:31 I use cbd oil for anxity. No more benzodiazepines for me!!!
1814 2018-08-27 19:42:11 Today has been productive. Worked for two hours, ran errands, got my oil changed, and now two hours early for my evening shift to help out the afternoon staff.  off to a good week. 
1815 2018-08-27 19:42:09 Herera our saver
1816 2018-08-27 19:42:09 This are negligible/ superficial changes. Let’s wait how Oil revenue will be shared. What percentage share will be palatable to #MustafaOmer. That’s when we will know difference between men and boys.

1819 2018-08-27 19:42:00 As Halloween nears I am reminded by how dumb people think "it's the only day I get to be myself" is deep. I'll call bullshit, beca. If you wanted to dress up as a  zombie cat everyday aint nobody at your essential oil pyramid scheme stopping you. #GrowUp #GlowUp #Truth
1820 2018-08-27 19:41:55 To be clear, if you’d dispose of your dead children in oil tanks, you’d likely have no issue killing them. Why have we not heard about his childhood his parents friends MISTRESS?!!

1825 2018-08-27 19:41:09 Dirty mechanic. With oil smudges and rolled up sleeves. He smiles bashfully. Maybe Captain Myung would reprimand him later for it....
1826 2018-08-27 19:41:06 #Socialist poster-kid: #Venezuela.Spending lavishly 2prop up like-minded allies' hold on power,investing heavily in giveaways @home,yet neglecting #modernization of the aging oil industry did the trick. Venezuela, tho possessing 1 of the world's largest oil reserves,is #bankrupt.
1827 2018-08-27 19:40:57 He spends ages saying absolutely nothing, I don't think he has ever said anything with any details in it ever, nothing but a snake oil salesman.

1830 2018-08-27 19:40:06 Should you only use virgin olive oil on food?
1831 2018-08-27 19:40:05 My vape pen broke and my oil leaked out
1832 2018-08-27 19:40:03 It needs a wailing engine burning lots of two stroke oil
1833 2018-08-27 19:40:02 for the twitter record I smell like moroccan oil and sadness, not bo.
1834 2018-08-27 19:39:57 Can’t find the compassion for a society that turns towards Marxism only to themselves in absolute poverty. And I especially can’t find the compassion when this society lives in one of the richest oil states.
1835 2018-08-27 19:39:57 Just some milk or water to cook it and  add brown sugar lmao that’s crazy what does oil/butter do for the oatmeal? 
1836 2018-08-27 19:39:53 De gea with the saver
1837 2018-08-27 19:39:50 Darn I’ve been using baby oil.
1838 2018-08-27 19:39:29 I don't know if it's coincidence or if the CBD oil is helping, but Lucy is going up stairs by herself again!
1839 2018-08-27 19:39:21 Not refreshing at all. Trump wants our oil at a low price

1842 2018-08-27 19:38:49 Getting an oil change real quick the  we will be home to stream! Grind never stops! NO DAYS OFF!!!
1843 2018-08-27 19:38:31 Wow I need an oil change and new breaks
1844 2018-08-27 19:38:31 When the price of oil tanked in '14, so did the GDP of the country, yet public spending was insanely high & continued to be so even after the crash. The Government decided instead to borrow unbelievably high amounts of cash to fill the deficit, hoping for a rebound in oil prices.
1845 2018-08-27 19:38:29 Yea?? I like do coconut oil too. What do you put in it?
1846 2018-08-27 19:38:27 Asbestos used to be very ubiquitous, and people hurt by it can seek compensation. The fact that there’s a demand for a product doesn’t absolve its manufacturer of all wrong doing. You’re fucking delusional if you think that oil companies are benevolent and practical.
1847 2018-08-27 19:38:02 What Kenya & the whole of Africa needs to understand is that it's not in there foreign interest for Africa to develop.

A developed Africa means a new military rival, higher costs of minerals from DRC, higher costs of Oil from Opec, increased immigration etc.

1848 2018-08-27 19:37:58 I took my braids out at the beginning of this month. I’ve tried conditioner, oil, clarifying shampoo. nothing worked. I ended up combing through it the best I could this morning and my hair was just breaking off and some of the knots came out in giant chunks.
1849 2018-08-27 19:37:41 You’re an idiot!! Do some damn fact checking and see that Putin is not being treated as a friend by the US thanks to President Trump. Toughest sanctions ever on Russia. Plus Trump ruined Russia’s oil deal with Germany! Stop being a sheep!!
1850 2018-08-27 19:37:03 The same way sambit patra is in ONGC to destroy evidence of modi 20000 Cr Oil SCAM !
1851 2018-08-27 19:36:56 Schumer knows it's an erasure of dem past and in effect removal of a monument to a dem segregationist. He's been planning this, craftily killing two birds.
1852 2018-08-27 19:36:52 Clearly you aren't because nothing you have said has any factual basis. The fact of the matter is that 95% of Venezuela's produce is in Oil, because of the value of oil in the early 2000s the country became exceptionally wealthy but neglected to produce anything else.
1853 2018-08-27 19:36:49 What is the future of this deal? From my point of view the deal was shady and was a propaganda only. Do you sell the chicken that give you gold. A wise man should not sell a wise man should invest. Two things you can’t avoid for future investment tech and oil.

1858 2018-08-27 19:36:12 This is a false belief, far more efficient mpg when compared to fossil cars. Cheaper fuel, it's step 1 in fixing climate change and away from oil based economy!
1859 2018-08-27 19:36:04 My only quibble is that there is Israeli. And it’s delicious.  Lots of middle eastern dishes.  Lots of fruits and vegetables. Flat breads. Liberal uses of sumac and olive oil. Marinated meats. Not a lot of pork. We have an Israeli restaurant here that I highly recommend.
1860 2018-08-27 19:35:50 We both know Irag and Afghanistan was for the oil. Iraq in particular has been recently severally termed a wrong move because the so-called weapons were never found. Was it? But all for control na. Is that who we are? Wasting innocent lives for gain?

1864 2018-08-27 19:35:27 Until HUGO CHAVEZ took power in 1999, Venezuela enjoyed ample prosperity, thanks to its world-leading oil reserves - But his populist SOCIALISM began a downward spiral that was accelerating even before MADURO took over - hear that Bernie Sanders?
1865 2018-08-27 19:35:20 ok and i didnt ask though...you can send me some hair oil if it bothers you so much or like get off my dick
1866 2018-08-27 19:35:15 "Heading into 4Q18, we expect rising non-OPEC oil production as supply outages abate and greenfield projects ramp up. In the US, tight oil production should grow by 750 thousand b/d between 2Q18 and 4Q18" - BofA

1879 2018-08-27 19:34:07 Enkosi lovie
I use coconut oil for my afro 
1880 2018-08-27 19:34:00 I dice them into ~1cm cubes (1/3 inch), then I coat them in a very small amount of olive oil and put them in the oven at 400 for ~15 mins. Just to  help get them soft. Then I add a little oil to a non-stick pan and throw them in. The goal is to make them soft but not too mushy.
1881 2018-08-27 19:33:59 Have any of my friends or followers done a pure coconut oil hair mask? I need to give it a go hmmm but I just don’t know how
1882 2018-08-27 19:33:42 Uhhmmm no. “Green” power is still an energy job. Somebody has to install and maintain all of those alternative energy sources. those are jobs just like any other. So this little group of yours is not about jobs, it’s about money for those to invest capital in oil and gas.

1893 2018-08-27 19:31:38 Wiped the sweat off my face with a napkin and don’t see any oil marks .  Is that normal ?
1894 2018-08-27 19:31:34 Most of saudi arabian oil is sold to Asia or the EAST they sell to china and japan. The US can’t afford to only buy US oil because their oil is more expensive to make and is owned by companies. Saudi oil is the cheapest to extract. And makes uo 13% of the world’s oil.
1895 2018-08-27 19:31:09 Please @KTHopkins, don't forget Belgium / Brussels ... 
Nothing has been solved here, not 1 thing.

And I know, you know ... 

Today near Brussels, a migrant pored boiling oil over another one ... and then he set the dude on fire !
1896 2018-08-27 19:31:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or American citizens.
1897 2018-08-27 19:31:05 Yup, a man with no morals  or ideas of what a true American is, he's a snake oil salesman, an a useless husband to his wife.
1898 2018-08-27 19:31:02 Oil for the salad I think.
1899 2018-08-27 19:31:01 Finally getting my oil changed

1905 2018-08-27 19:30:45 Long way to go tho before we are net exporter of hydrocarbons to Canada.   Import a ton of oil from the North.    But swing vis a vis Mexico is remarkable.

1912 2018-08-27 19:30:24 What Peña kept silent was that the foreign debt doubled, his gobers and secretaries stole billions of dollars, privatized oil and water, there were 100,000 murders, he allowed tax evasion to large companies, he protected Cesar Duarte, he burned at 43.

1917 2018-08-27 19:29:56 Obamas failed appointments: Chas Freeman, withdrew over questions about payments from the Saudi Arabian government, business ties to the state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp., and negative statements he made about U.S. support for Israel.
1918 2018-08-27 19:29:56 I don't know much of the history. Why hasn't Venezuela been able to exploit and sell some of its vast oil reserves to alleviate its situation?
1919 2018-08-27 19:29:22 Coconut and castor oil my friend. Use it every night!!!!
1920 2018-08-27 19:29:19 I don't like Castor oil . Ha.a ill get it tomorrow 
1921 2018-08-27 19:29:15 Biodiesel is by far the most seamless alternative fuel; NO engine modifications, 2 billions gallons burned in US last year alone. Its time to unleash US farmers & start making our fuel and our food more local. With Peak Oil coming its our best hope
1922 2018-08-27 19:29:14 Did you use 1 or 2 full bottles of oil for this? 
1923 2018-08-27 19:29:14 Isn't it amazing?! What's your favorite reason to use Tea Tree oil?
1924 2018-08-27 19:29:14 Playing oil refinery’s and nuclear power plant teams is tough
1925 2018-08-27 19:29:06 so i’ve started doing oil pulling and my teeth feel HELLA squeaky clean after doing it once. wow 10/10
1926 2018-08-27 19:28:53 I know I’m not the only one that heard a CBD oil commercial on @SportsTalk790.
1927 2018-08-27 19:28:51 Maybe she’s sweating oil? I dunno.
1928 2018-08-27 19:28:42 Venezuelan oil is very heavy and not very clean so requires mixing with lighter Brent crude varieties to make it useable, something which the sanctions block. Also, Venezuela has been stopped from transacting in USD which is the world reserve currency.
1929 2018-08-27 19:28:02 Truth is...crude oil (hydrocarbons), like any other minerals is naturally formed under extreme pressure and heat, NOT from fossil remains. The problem these days is people accept everything at face value and do not inquire enough. Nobody questions anything anymore...sad!!.
1930 2018-08-27 19:27:46 What’s your background in the oil industry?
1931 2018-08-27 19:27:45 Rising oil prices mean more drilling.
I work for a drilling company.
Its good for me and my co-workers.
1932 2018-08-27 19:27:44 Is it good for applying directly to burns?
1933 2018-08-27 19:27:39 FL constitutional amendments 2018--If u support vaping indoors u have to support offshore oil drilling. And if u are in favor of survivor benefits for family of military/first responders, u must also favor the current college governance system. 4 issues, only 2 amendments. WHY??
1934 2018-08-27 19:27:33 They can ask America to drill their oil take expenses and 20% and give them the rest back. They cannot be successful on their own.

1938 2018-08-27 19:27:22 That wouldn’t change even if we had a cross Canada pipeline. We are bound to agreements with the US to sell them our oil to refine and then they sell it back to us
1939 2018-08-27 19:27:10 This daft cunt actually fell asleep on a sunbed with oil on her fat arse and completely burnt it

1941 2018-08-27 19:26:48 Update: I put thieves and castor oil on my staph infection and it’s just about gone. I used oregano on 2skin tags they are gone. Head over to @livingliberated.me and check out the girls for tips @younglivingeo #healthylifestyle #allnatural
1942 2018-08-27 19:26:44 So it's terrible to raise the gas tax by $1 a gallon, but when oil companies jack the price up by $1,$2,$3 a gallon that's just market forces, and it's fine?
1943 2018-08-27 19:26:34  so I dipped the okra into a beaten egg, before adding to the breadcrumbs. I had cayenne pepper and salt mixed in with the breadcrumbs, I then layer them out in a baking tray, drizzled a little olive oil over them and roasted till crunchy looking!

1948 2018-08-27 19:25:44 The last time I got an oil change the mechanic backed a Mercedes into a pole so let’s see how this goes :)

1950 2018-08-27 19:25:37 I’m gonna rename it. I’m getting an oil change for my birthday but I probably don’t need it at this painting.
1951 2018-08-27 19:25:32 What Peña kept silent was that the foreign debt doubled, his gobers and secretaries stole billions of dollars, privatized oil and water, there were 100,000 murders, he allowed tax evasion to large companies, he protected Cesar Duarte, he burned at 43.
1952 2018-08-27 19:25:29 Eco-induced anxiety is the actual worst. I think you just have to know what you prioritise the most - otherwise it's too much, e.g plastic free vs palm oil, vs fair trade. You can't avoid everything - and if you somehow manage to please tell me your secrets #ethicalhour

1954 2018-08-27 19:24:37 Because they had oil and the US/EU oil companies gained control of the oil fields via corrupt deals with officials. When the government decided to take control of their own natural resources and ejected the US/EU oil companies both governments imposed sanctions stopping trade.

1957 2018-08-27 19:23:49 Also this guy at the gym is using an old gallon jug of olive oil as his water bottle  why do I find that so funny hahah
1958 2018-08-27 19:23:44 Unfortunately America has been stockpiling it’s own oil and using the worlds instead
1959 2018-08-27 19:23:44 "Use that money to fight poverty" The fact that I don't hear those words when you're all being conned into another oil filled intervention abroad is absolutely astounding. You lot are literally too stupid to insult, no words are strong enough to describe your retardation.
1960 2018-08-27 19:23:32 Its digging up the oil, bits of Saudi you can dig up oil with a spade, Venezuela you have to drill through mountains in the jungle. And the "reforms" put in by Chavez at al. Have broken the non oil part of the economy (I don't think the KSA uses price controls on anything)

The EU have said they are happy for scots to nip back in.

1965 2018-08-27 19:22:55 So having Oil was a real benefit and enabled them to build up massive cash reserves? How did that bastion of capitalism the UK ( under Thatcheism)do with Scotland's oil
1966 2018-08-27 19:22:52 @realDonaldTrump If I ever interviewed you, one of the very first questions I would ask is, HOW MANY DOGS AND CATS DID YOU SKIN ALIVE, PUT ON FIRE, AND DIP IN HOT OIL when you were a child?????
1967 2018-08-27 19:22:52 What I love about porn now, is it’s so diverse. It’s not just showing boring vanilla sex. I get turned on by wrestling, bondage, oil. It’s come a far way. Which is a great thing :) There’s something for everybody
1968 2018-08-27 19:22:50 What about other oppressive regimes like the Saudi's and Israeli government? Although you wouldn't want to rock the boat as they have oil, to hell with the oppressed people of Saudi Arabia and the neighbouring countries of Israel or the Gaza strip or the people of Yemen.
1969 2018-08-27 19:22:47 Yes we have an oil for pets

1972 2018-08-27 19:22:31 Похоже, что в Америке яйца моют, а в России -- не очень. Никакого "light coating of edible mineral oil which restores protection" на них нет.

1974 2018-08-27 19:22:21 Why is he putting all this oil on me I want. My feet relax not my legs #MondayVibes
1975 2018-08-27 19:22:18 Canada has more oil, valuable resources, & energy per capita than almost any other nation; yet Canadians do not get the advantage of cheap energy & resources. We sell low on export & buy back own resources at world prices in USD. Canada imports 1st stage gas; plus all max taxed.
1976 2018-08-27 19:22:10 The Pope should resign because he put more pressure on oil companies over Global Warming than he did on the diocesan hierarchy to deal with child sex abuse.
1977 2018-08-27 19:22:01 ur skin might be losing too much of its natural oils when washing! I think this happens to me but I haven’t mastered it just yet  but I switched to cleansing oil (@BadgerBalmUSA) instead of soaps/creams and my face feels 10000x better 
1978 2018-08-27 19:21:54 And they have oil - lots of oil. Almost defies imagination to put up those kinds of numbers with that much wealth in the ground. Oil can be s curse of it makes a country too rich too fast but poor like this? That takes real talent.

1 tablespoon lemon juice

1980 2018-08-27 19:21:39 highlight of my Monday so far was during my lunch break I got a freaking fish bone stuck in my throat so I drank 1/4 cup of olive oil to dislodge it and i still don't know where that fucker is

1983 2018-08-27 19:21:19 Clove oil tends to help a little bit if it's not sealed with a filling by now. Otherwise, ibuprofen every 4-6 hours. Shit's hell on the liver though
1984 2018-08-27 19:21:14 we absolutely do not need to decide what the change will look like. our decision would be a fiction, and reality is stranger than fiction. we have no choice; we must put oil companies out of business, now. then there will be plenty of time for the ideologues to argue.

1993 2018-08-27 19:19:22 Hello, lube and sex toy expert here: oils shouldn’t be used in the vagina or anus. Oil takes too long to absorb into the body and allows bacteria to bond with it, increasing risk for infections. If you’re worried about sticky lube, use silicone. Pjurr is my favorite.

2035 2018-08-27 19:14:55 What I mean is the way the KSA manages its soceity can be paid for from its oil revenue, Venezuela's can't, partly due to what the Venezuelan government has attempted to do and partly becuase the cost of production in Venezuela is quite high.
2036 2018-08-27 19:14:54 Kind of you to ask  no I only sleep like three four hours a night after my parents traumatized me with piano lessons at 6am everyday starting age 6, burning midnight oil all through high school and uni,  the candle at both ends as it were. Don’t end up like me ahhahahahaa 
2037 2018-08-27 19:14:50 So sanctions on Iran and the fall in Venz. oil production will max-out at 0.550 mmb/d in Dec, 2018, then sanctions will end on Iran and Venz production restored by July, 2019. Is that what this graph implies? How does 1.65 mmb/d of Permian oil get to market without new pipelines?

2046 2018-08-27 19:13:10 So now, thanks to our pres, Iran has now declared they are in control on the straight of Hormus. This is a main way of oil transport. This is also bc Trump broke the Iran nuclear agreement. So guess we get higher gas prices. Thanks, asshole.

2057 2018-08-27 19:11:13 We don’t refine 95% of our oil here and neither would we if we had the energy east pipeline. Wake up.
2058 2018-08-27 19:11:09 In our analysis, we found that as efforts to cut emissions reduce oil demand, the value of Aramco could be reduced to as little as $700 billion
2059 2018-08-27 19:11:05 my family has never fried anything in cooking except for eggrolls, and we never dispose of that oil correctly... hot oil scaring me has probably been the only thing stopping me from making a million deeply unhealthy things I see from videos online 
2060 2018-08-27 19:10:49 The translation of poetry is both a crime and a bottle of argan oil for my paper.
2061 2018-08-27 19:10:46 You mean be in business with a snake oil salesman like Guerrero ??
2062 2018-08-27 19:10:31 He spoke about Nigeria's continuing dependence on oil and the need ti diversify the economy, I asked what he did about these issues when he was VP. You haven't  answered the question, sir.
2063 2018-08-27 19:10:28 I have reminders in my Phone that let me know when to wash, co wash, deep condition, hot oil treatment my hair. I shampooed it today with ORS. I currently use Jamaican black castor oil
2064 2018-08-27 19:10:26 Norway is pretty damn cool! That oil money fund will soon allow them to almost not work if they decided to!!
2065 2018-08-27 19:10:23 Andy "snake oil, more faces than the Eiger" Burnham. Dead Ringers did a parody of him a couple of years ago, sounded just as you described.

2068 2018-08-27 19:10:10 May be oil gate is closed
2069 2018-08-27 19:10:06 I’m not fighting for anything, I don’t believe in using oil (a dying resource by the way) and finding more earth friendly alternatives
2070 2018-08-27 19:10:05 I miss-spoke.  I was referring to the extremely high use of biofuel (burning trees) in Sweden.  But back to the topic at hand, Norway appears to be the only other major oil producer with a carbon tax, but emissions have not gone down. What will Canada do differently?
2071 2018-08-27 19:10:05 Thanks that does help
2072 2018-08-27 19:10:04 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
2073 2018-08-27 19:10:00 My cat broke his tail  but a regular of mine is a #CBD rep and gave me a bunch of oil and the difference in kittys level of pain and comfort is like night and day  #cbdoil
2074 2018-08-27 19:09:59 Me to wife: Someone just threw a bottle of Omega-3 pills at my head

Wife: Who? Where?

Me: Luckily my woulds were just Super Fish Oil

Wife: OMG. John. Ugh.

*Disclaimer... not my own joke. Saw it on a sign and tried it on my wife 
#DadJokes #DadLife
2075 2018-08-27 19:09:38 Thanks, Robert! It does my old heart good to hear from someone who IS in the Word! Keep lots of oil in your flask! Tell the nations.

2076 2018-08-27 19:09:19 Re “oil boom town,” I wonder if Edna Ferber ever saw this prediction about the area?
2077 2018-08-27 19:09:12 My nails are actually growing for the first time like.. ever and i think I’m going to actually let them grow out!   S/O fish oil

2079 2018-08-27 19:09:09 Griffin, let's face it: You and Ava were a mismatch from the start. Loved y'all, but... yeah, oil and water. #GH
2080 2018-08-27 19:09:05 This is Angela Aamer United States of America Agriculture Commissioner contacting you to view Oil and Gas field equipment on Auction Ohio. (901)422-2132 acaamer@ualr.edu
2081 2018-08-27 19:09:00 How can you even value a private company like Aramco? You can’t. Even if countries started pumping oil they would still buy off of Aramco (some oil is way too expensive to extract so it makes sense for them to buy it instead)
2082 2018-08-27 19:08:46 Dirty rotten Canadian fossil fuel oil please!
2083 2018-08-27 19:08:43 @AliVelshi Don’t forget Canada on NAFTA has a raw deal on energy. This would be now off the table. We sell USA oil at low rate now per NAFTA.
2084 2018-08-27 19:08:39 Stroopwafel, canal and sun... brings back memories! If you know of any gigs relating to UK oil and gas law (or from September, Jersey company law) let me know!
2085 2018-08-27 19:08:38 I wonder if my sister or somebody want take my car to get an oil change 
2086 2018-08-27 19:08:32 I made more working on an A-frame in the oil fields than I made as a chef, teacher and writer combined, let alone what they paid me when I was bumped up into a supervisory position in the refinery.
2087 2018-08-27 19:08:25 The mileage on your oil is subjective and doesn't matter if you run synthetic oil. As long as you keep it topped up, you're fine.
2088 2018-08-27 19:08:14 Fish oil supplements don’t ward off heart disease: studyAry
2089 2018-08-27 19:08:13 Teak oil is what I was supplied with when I bought my first outdoor furniture. Xktx
2090 2018-08-27 19:08:11 I’ll be streaming as soon as I get home. Had to get my oil changed. Gimme 15ish more minutes! So the usual time hahhaa

2093 2018-08-27 19:07:57 Ummm NO ... Energy East was designed to carry 1.1 million barrels of oil 4,500 km from Alberta to Saint John every day, where some of it will be refined at Irving Oil’s refinery before being loaded onto ships and exported to world markets. What's keeping gas prices high is TAX.
2094 2018-08-27 19:07:51 I just cleanse with a gentle cleanser and exfoliate 2x a week. I used a rose water toner from lush followed by oil (I’ve been using grape seed oil) and Kiehl’s moisturizer
2095 2018-08-27 19:07:39 The amount of money oil producing African countries make yearly is enough to end extreme poverty in Africa, yet many Africans are poor.
2096 2018-08-27 19:07:34 I ended up putting on a pair of gloves from a hair dye kit and grabbing some vegetable oil cooking spray and wiggling him loose. He may have partially drowned in the oil so he may have brain damage but I had good intentions and he jumped away so he was alive!
2097 2018-08-27 19:07:33 My boy's birthday is coming up this weekend, his girlfriend made plans, we have made plans and our plans are really oil and water.
2098 2018-08-27 19:07:29 he's married
2099 2018-08-27 19:07:11 My signature dish is 2 minute macaroni with white truffle oil
2100 2018-08-27 19:07:07 That is a very interesting question.  The specific brand of oil is clearly much more important than eg.did anyone eat any fatty fish, or shellfish or for than matter onions or mushrooms,  or increased processed foods over the last 5 years.  One would think they could make use it.
2101 2018-08-27 19:06:57 Coming from a country that has had high-profile cases against oil companies, it isn't an absurd assumption at all to equate oil industry with intentional land destruction.  The article clearly positions the refinery as first and utmost object of protection, then the rest
2102 2018-08-27 19:06:56 Funny, that looks like an inverted peak oil chart...
2103 2018-08-27 19:06:48 @mLouisep Just curious... Have you ever tried CBD oil? Am thinking of trying it for the Dystonic pains, but...ya know...the great unknown (and I'm a wimp ;))...
2104 2018-08-27 19:06:47 OIL OF EVERY PEARL’S UN-INSIDES
2105 2018-08-27 19:06:41 Well! Our Lavender castile bar soaps do contain organic coconut oil, but I hear you saying that you want it to SMELL like coconut. I'll share your feedback with the team :) -Stacey
2106 2018-08-27 19:06:32 the lie of energy independence

the USA is  dependent on around 8 mb/d of crude oil imports, 4.3 mb/d out of which come from countries where oil production has already peaked and/or where there are geopolitical problems. 

 April 2018 US  crude imports were about 6 mb/d,
2107 2018-08-27 19:06:25 Are you really that surprised? Trump has multiple times proven that he is willing to cut off his nose to spite his face.

plus the United States has done a lot to expand their drilling capacity since NAFTA was ratified, not saying that it's not nice to have that Canadian Oil too!

2109 2018-08-27 19:06:14 Children everywhere have lice. Schools have a standard letter to send out. Neem oil dressing and a session with a fine comb seems just as good as insecticide shampoo...
2110 2018-08-27 19:06:09 And home. 545 miles - I’m not saying how long it took, but the mighty Trumpet is ticking and tinckling like a good un as it cools down. Used a fair drop of oil though - more on that when I’ve had a closer look... 
2111 2018-08-27 19:06:08 Come check out these Evolvd cartridges, their oil is so clean, & single source origin. We even have Nectar Lime from Mother Magnolia!
2112 2018-08-27 19:06:04 @JohnCornyn - sellout.  Even big oil knows we need to do something.  Most are active in renewable energy.  The issue isn't just flooding, it's clean air, clean water.

2115 2018-08-27 19:05:21 Apparently trading rotations on oil on the 10 second chart is where it's at. 
2116 2018-08-27 19:05:07 You people are so funny, haven't a clue what's going on but always being the ass in the covo has to do with big trade deal with petromex, Lopez-Obrador has opened new exploration for oil AND refineries. Nothing to do with being racist pigs so you wouldn't get it
2117 2018-08-27 19:04:52 Well that is a buggar. Im not happy to hear that. Enjoy every day and keep tweeting on here...I will keep making you smile..
2118 2018-08-27 19:04:51 My daughters will learn about cars. How to change the oil, how to fix brakes, how to change tires, etc. It’s nothing that’s too “manly” they won’t know.
2119 2018-08-27 19:04:34 Lavender oil can cure any ailment I am sure of this
2120 2018-08-27 19:04:34 Todos los meses igual. La concha de tu madre truck oil 
2121 2018-08-27 19:04:23 im at walmart getting my oil changed and theres this icc grounds guy waiting and he said he drove through the parking lot and there was “dope wafting through the air” lmaooo
2122 2018-08-27 19:04:20 Canada must look elsewhere for trading partner's at least thats what Trudeau's liberal's keep saying about our oil ........
2123 2018-08-27 19:04:18 My coworker has an essential oil diffuser and he just put it on. The office get so relaxed when he turns on the diffuser. I need to buy one for myself
2124 2018-08-27 19:04:03 If the world's powers didn't rely so much on their oil, they'd have intervened a long time ago. It's horrifying that a child's life is worth less than a barrel of oil.
2125 2018-08-27 19:03:55 Why only few countries hold so much of fossil fuel reserves and others...not much...? Are they really fossil fuels...? One theory says that crude oil is actually formed in earth mantle from extensive heat and presure and is pushed up constantly, not from fossils.
2126 2018-08-27 19:03:49 US global engagement is very clear for anyone who doesn't watch CNN.. it's either oil/military bases or terrorism(creation and financing). It's funny how every country the US has "democratized" has some terrorist group running around. #KenyaUSrelations
2127 2018-08-27 19:03:36 They fixed Oil Ocean.
2128 2018-08-27 19:03:30 Honestly just gonna work the oil rigs 
2129 2018-08-27 19:03:28 you when colors don’t work and more importantly how to fix it. I’d recommend saving a folder of pieces with colors u really like and spend some time studying them! traditional oil paintings are also rly great for this bc the palette tends to be more limited—
2130 2018-08-27 19:03:23 4시네 자야지
2131 2018-08-27 19:03:13 I want a nationalized oil company so we can be wealthy like Norway. It sounds like you're just here fighting for the Irving crime family.
2132 2018-08-27 19:03:10 I really just ingest maybe 10 drops if i aint got time, put it in some tea or just fill it in a oil difuser
2133 2018-08-27 19:03:10 Five Guys makes their fries w peanut oil so... 

Literally can’t eat there.
2134 2018-08-27 19:03:10 Well @ChrystyaFreela1 and @JustinTrudeau what do you think of this? You scuppered yet another trade deal with your virtue signalling bullshit, or is this all part of the George Soros plan for ruining Canada so you and your globalist mates can then own our oil and mineral rights?
2135 2018-08-27 19:02:49 Just remember... Fireball = swing oil.

2137 2018-08-27 19:02:31 they are both missing the point. Regardless of whether the climate is changing & we are the cause (we can debate that forever), regardless of both those questions, we know without qualification that oil is not endless, and cannot sustain our infatuation with electricity forever.
2138 2018-08-27 19:02:29 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
2139 2018-08-27 19:02:28 G...garlic chip hot oil gyoza
2140 2018-08-27 19:02:25 FYI: "Canola oil" cooking spray is *not* as effective against a wasp as 
"buttery" cooking spray.
It just makes the wasp mad.
2141 2018-08-27 19:02:24 Anyone remember him sending thousands of militarily personal to die in a foreign country over a bullshit war that did nothing but make a few oil executives richer?
2142 2018-08-27 19:02:21 We shall see?The time of truth is upon us. Mr Trump would not have allowed him to continue without approval. IMO.
2143 2018-08-27 19:02:21 اللهم ارنا فيهم عجائب قدرتك واظهر الحق وانصر كل مظلوب وفك كربه ياكريم
2144 2018-08-27 19:02:20 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
2145 2018-08-27 19:02:10 Despite the fact that the price of crude oil has risen above 2018 bugget benchmark of recent. Failure of @OfficialAPCNg and @MBuhari  led government.
2146 2018-08-27 19:02:06 I'm not listening to anymore of ur shit bud u already lost me as a fan before you even gained it. Natives naturally have more oil in there hair and over washing it is actually bad for it causes dry scalp hair loss ect. Don't mean I don't bath or wash my hair
2147 2018-08-27 19:02:03 I don't know if there's a more vivid example of the "curse of resources" now than what has become #Venezuela... decades ago one of the founders of OPEC, Juan Pablo Perez Alfonso called oil "the excrement of the devil". He was completely spot on. #oott
2148 2018-08-27 19:02:01 At that point... you wish you had a bumper made out of oil field pipe...

2150 2018-08-27 19:01:44 Price of oil went up 13% last quarter.
2151 2018-08-27 19:01:10 Just watched ITV news and it called it a washout...ludicrous. People use their creative skills to make the most of the day. The cooler weather meant you could actually enjoy more time in the open air..no worries with sun tan oil either!!
2152 2018-08-27 19:00:58 One might need to correct for low oil production during the quarter.
2153 2018-08-27 19:00:58 life hack: take your used motor oil to the farmers market and sell it as "car milk" until they kick you out
2154 2018-08-27 19:00:57 Yes it's  a global endeavor with money laundering stock trading & manipulation drugs sex trafficking as well as oil and natural gas. I think the manipulation of the dollar and euro might come into play as well.
2155 2018-08-27 19:00:49 Oil Pump is out, have to grind the tab down to spin the flange around to have that bastard of a bolt to the outboard side to make it easier.
2156 2018-08-27 19:00:47 Well Trump does need a war to drive up the price of oil to over $100 a barrel so that his ExxxonMobil buddies & Russia can resume Artic & tar sands exploration!

2172 2018-08-27 18:59:21 I understand what you’re saying, I really do. The issue I have from an Alberta perspective is we don’t pay for things; we rely on resource royalties to keep our taxes artificially low. Then oil busts and we go into debt to keep things going. It starts with revenue.
2173 2018-08-27 18:58:55  sai oga
2174 2018-08-27 18:58:52 Eeeeuw. Not so much with the marmite but the bath oil is now on my shopping list. If I take my travel mug I’ll claim my free cuppa and newspaper, which will make the extravagant outlay fully justified.
2175 2018-08-27 18:58:49 The communities living in oil producing areas in #SouthSudan where oil has been extracted from deserve to get what they are owed - some of the revenue AND compensation for the displacement and environmental damage caused there.

2188 2018-08-27 18:57:13 Well just donate YOUR tax saving then, and leave the rest alone. You guys have great ideas on spending someone else’s money! And you are not giving it to oil co., it’s THEIR money to start with.

2191 2018-08-27 18:56:58 The smell of cooked meat and oil just ain’t for me today
2192 2018-08-27 18:56:58 Nope. They congratulated Chavez on giving some of the oil revenue to the poor. Which they did. That's it.
2193 2018-08-27 18:56:56 I agree that it has been singularly focused on preventing knowledge and preventing study. I'd say the Oil and arms industries in general are like that.
2194 2018-08-27 18:56:50 gabe loves bat flips so he will probably buy him a jar of coconut oil
2195 2018-08-27 18:56:47 Them oil fields be cashing yall out
2196 2018-08-27 18:56:41 I need an oil change so bad I just filled my tank yesterday & haven’t been no where but work & home & I only got half a tank 
2197 2018-08-27 18:56:30 I am of the opinion that the words environmentally friendly & plastics are mutually exclusive. Unless I am very much mistaken plastic is a derivative of oil. Oil is a fossil fuel the use of which is harmful to the planet.
2198 2018-08-27 18:56:29 I'm placing an essential oil order tomorrow if any family or friends needs anything at a discount let me know!
2199 2018-08-27 18:56:20 I rember her story. Brought me to tears. Out of recognition and anger.

I have a similar background but ended on the lucky side of the line, if one can say so. I still struggle. I do use CBD oil with varrying success. Which is something i advocate much to people who seek relief.
2200 2018-08-27 18:56:18 I swear by Tea Tree Oil, my skin is the best it's ever been because of it 
2201 2018-08-27 18:56:12 If u like no make me best man 
2202 2018-08-27 18:56:08 I feel like small children won’t be interested in the little oil bottle vs the brownies, access for teens is the same problem that alcohol and prescription drugs present imo
2203 2018-08-27 18:55:56 Yeah it's like taking castor oil everyday it gives me the shits
2204 2018-08-27 18:55:54 Nobody told me oil changes on new cars are 90$
2205 2018-08-27 18:55:49 What would be the rate for establishing oil seed with a sumo trio and applying liquid Fertilizer in 1 pass ??
2206 2018-08-27 18:55:30 Calm yourself Brenda ,you’re no oil painting yourself
2207 2018-08-27 18:55:28 Lol
2208 2018-08-27 18:55:27 Use Sweet Oil
2209 2018-08-27 18:55:13 No, that's the oil brush.
2210 2018-08-27 18:55:09 그러자 갑자기 가위에 눌러버리고 만 것..
2211 2018-08-27 18:55:00 It’s actually savage that takeaways make me so sick, why do they use so much oil 
2212 2018-08-27 18:54:58 Didn't the rebels just become part of your government? Either way, illegal is illegal. Otherwise, don't shift blame when we come and steal your oil.
2213 2018-08-27 18:54:52 I love the composition! What may help if u feel intimidated by oils is: dirty up the canvas before starting so the colors will converge better, + there wont be any white streaks appearing out of nowhere! 
I major in painting w/ focus on oil so u can dm me if u want to talk 
2214 2018-08-27 18:54:52 I’ve heard snake oil causes hallucinations
2215 2018-08-27 18:54:43 Coconut oil/salt 
Being around water
2216 2018-08-27 18:54:33 werey
2217 2018-08-27 18:54:32 One time like this, in JSS2, the ice cube maker was frozen with ice, I wá home bored with friends, so we put palm oil in a plate and took it with the ice cubes. Crazy stupid combo
2218 2018-08-27 18:54:31 난 점심시간도 많이 남곤해서 낮잠 자려고 자리에서 한쪽팔 쭉 뻗고 다른 한쪽팔 접어서 머리에 베고 엎드림
2219 2018-08-27 18:54:27 You ever gotten your car’s oil changed, tires rotated and washed all in one day? If you haven’t, you really should. The satisfaction is unreal.
2220 2018-08-27 18:54:24 زي حاجات كتير  ظلم وغدر وقتل وتشويه سمعه
وهلاك ودمار عيله وموت ملايكة يستاهل يعيشوا في الجنه
لكن يموتوا ليه بالشكل ده وتبقي مصيبة الاب مصبيتين يفقد ولاده ويتهم بقتلهم
2221 2018-08-27 18:54:24 It's so good, and also palm oil free 
2222 2018-08-27 18:54:24 @verb ghost oil in all forms slays 
2223 2018-08-27 18:54:18 just wash it with sunlight bar soap (green) and put baby oil... Please don't try to remove it
2224 2018-08-27 18:54:12 Castor oil
2225 2018-08-27 18:54:11 Me neither, but what I do know is that we are never told the exact figures of profits from Scottish oil, therefor I don't trust anything else.  Frankly I don't anything that WM say to begin with.
2226 2018-08-27 18:54:05 Any of my followers who use CBD oil, what's your preferred method of ingestion? My choices are between tinctures (dropper) or gel caps.
2227 2018-08-27 18:54:04 yep...100.
How are you keeping with Mr Kidney ?
2228 2018-08-27 18:54:02 Correct me if I'm wrong but, isn't the USA now an exporter of oil? I don't think you need our oil that badly
2229 2018-08-27 18:54:01 They are hungry, suddenly the money machine (i.e tax payer's money) went dry wow! The elections are around the corner & they will do anything just to get hold of any Metro Public Purse to oil their campaign machine 
2230 2018-08-27 18:53:57 Everyone can see Modi's snake oil for what it is, and it's his fascists giving these hooligans a veneer of respectability... Congress needs to get its act together. It would also help if murders of Indian secularist and journalists got more attention overseas.
2231 2018-08-27 18:53:50 Plastic comes from oil and oil comes from dead dinosaurs does that mean plastic toy dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs??
2232 2018-08-27 18:53:49 vitamin E oil has done actual wonders for my skin
it smells bad but it's so good wow
2233 2018-08-27 18:53:42 Well We Need To Get You A Lil Bit Of Oil
2234 2018-08-27 18:53:40 I think Iran better "Stand Down" over the control of straight of Hormuz. If Iranian​ forces slow the flow of oil thru this passage way. Or start harrasing vessels. The United States will respond with overwhelming military force. Bringing all out war to the shores of Iran.
2235 2018-08-27 18:53:34 Always sauté with red onions Trader Joe's Everyday Seasoning, garlic salt. Black pepper Turmeric. Avocado oil. Coconut oil. Im on year 12 and loving it
2236 2018-08-27 18:53:27 It's is mine field on Social media. There are many that want to knock your good work. I'm Glad SS is concentrating on his team getting all that oil out of #Horsehill and forward planning the next drill or test.

2238 2018-08-27 18:53:01 Wisely they have an oil fund Richard so if it gets really bad they have a back up...handy that eh!!!!
2239 2018-08-27 18:52:52 Truly disappointing.... You might as well be attempting to park a bottle of oil! lol posting this to Yahoo! Video
2240 2018-08-27 18:52:48 ...eat healthy fats (olive oil,avocado, salmon), and eat a lot of vegetables 
note : don’t use theses tips if you have an ED. This doesn’t mean you should be restricting!!

4. Spend quality time with friends.
2241 2018-08-27 18:52:37 We should collab. Yung motor oil and Yung bin bag on the beat
2242 2018-08-27 18:52:23 Where can I buy tea tree oil, is it expensive, you know I’m always a broke girl
2243 2018-08-27 18:52:10 그 반에 있던 동안은 유난히도 과하게 가위에 잘 걸렸었지 그것 나뿐만이 아니였어 내 친구도 곧 잘 눌렸고 울 반 애들도 가위 눌렸단 말이 유난히 많았던 해였고 가위에서 깨는 방법도 서로 공유 많이 하곤 했음
2244 2018-08-27 18:52:01 Factor 50 wouldn't burn you like that? You can also get the oil stuff that has tanning enhancers.
2245 2018-08-27 18:51:59 Just smother it in oil and fry it. That's how you make a fish in the US lol
2246 2018-08-27 18:51:54 Ororo no be crude oil, Puasy cat, no be Tiger. 
Work, and don't be lazy.
2247 2018-08-27 18:51:40 Unfortunately Ms Baldwin i feel ashamed for you and Mrs May. It seems Africa is only of interest when you want to further your neocolonial agenda. You went to Ambazonia and signed an oil contract. You are exploring the oil at the expense of the genocide against our people. SHAME
2248 2018-08-27 18:51:36 It's embarrassing to me to hear Africans cite natural resources as wealth. Land, minerals,oil,etc don't make anyone wealthy..It's knowledge, what's in your head, that makes one wealthy..
2249 2018-08-27 18:51:32 Me: It’s hot af outside so what ima do about lotion if ima sweat it off.?                    Cali:Boy put some baby oil on it’s good .                                                         Me: My niqqa it’s 93 degrees and you say put on baby oil , yha trippin

How to realistically form effective industry best practices around its handling?
2272 2018-08-27 18:49:33 he filled my gas tank up, washed and vacuumed my car, and went to get me an oil change all while I'm at work. Not to mention his birthday is Thursday and he doing all this for me and I didn't ask.

2289 2018-08-27 18:47:53 I use the lip top jars to preserve our eggplant in olive oil and herbs.  Jam jars are used for jam. Have many Ball spring lid top jars with rubber gaskets from my Mother that I use for tomatoes. Such a busy time of year, but nice to enjoy our efforts during Winter & beyond.

2292 2018-08-27 18:47:41 There's no significant oil deposits in Kenya. Therefore, considering US trend in global engagement, the only other US Interest in Kenya must be militarily related... We're doomed.  #KenyaUSrelations
2293 2018-08-27 18:47:35 For a country that is not producing anything, we really need to learn from China .  To refine the oil we have in abundance is a problem.          Who did we offend?
2294 2018-08-27 18:47:30 Wake up America, your President is unworthy. To him, Jared Kushner deserves more honor than a real man like McCain (whom I disagree with btw).
2295 2018-08-27 18:47:29 Rather it go to a good cause rather than to Oil companies destroying our state.
2296 2018-08-27 18:47:28 Diversification means to me, Divide and Conquer which I believe will be the downfall of Canada, after all, how can one work together with those who believe that Unity is not possible I.e. No man made laws can change the fact that oil and water will never mix as Islam is non Islam
2297 2018-08-27 18:47:15 Midnight Oil had the best politics of all
2298 2018-08-27 18:47:07 yes @juliaHB1 you can't criticise the Venezuelan situation without referring to how greedy oil companies/USA are  interfering with the economy.  If you'd like to slag off socialism, see if you can find many holes in the Norwegian model.    Or Danish.
2299 2018-08-27 18:46:42 I prefer Snake Oil Salesman  but Bullshit Artist is good too

2307 2018-08-27 18:45:38 I’m surprised @realDonaldTrump was willing to give up US energy security so easily. It will be challenging for the US to rely on Saudi Arabia and Venezuela for oil in a crisis. Canada gave those energy assurances as part of NAFTA. I sure hope that  @USTradeRep has a plan? Anyone?
2308 2018-08-27 18:45:38 I recommend a bottle of seaweed and arnica bath oil too. Heavenly...

2311 2018-08-27 18:45:28 @RobertFife What action should be expected regarding a Canada/US trade deal? Plus, when can we expect it, because the clock is ticking. A friend in the London financial sector says October deadline, unless talks are going well, then December, but only if oil stays high.
2312 2018-08-27 18:45:23 There is something resembles when OIL reflects JIO by it's mirror!

2328 2018-08-27 18:43:47 It is ridiculous. All #Shell, #BritishPetroleum #BP, #ExxonMobil &co oil companies do is drill, pollute and make our people desolate in our own land. They'll come to our farmland, drill our oil, pollute our rivers with oil spillage, abandon it&take the money to America and Europe
2329 2018-08-27 18:43:37 Yeah we could also look at the oil money.
2330 2018-08-27 18:42:59 Does anybody vape CBD oil? If you do, tell me all you know plz
2331 2018-08-27 18:42:50 Did they tell you about their oil fund? The one they were bright enough to negotiate while the UK  Govt. just splashed the cash?
2332 2018-08-27 18:42:38 Only thing with that is, who has 3 hours to wait around for the effects to set in? I’d say oil extracts are the happy medium.
2333 2018-08-27 18:42:30 @LuvzTech l called mom & brother before to take a good shower, my skin being full of sun oil! Everything seems to be good for mom, even if she was confused, no really knowing what is the day today, she does not remind when my bro gonna eat with her! It's Wednesday, l'll go

2364 2018-08-27 18:38:30 If that is true then no wonder the millionaires of the West wanted rid of him. Imagine people finding out that an oil rich state used its money for its own people and not giving it to the already wealthy, as happens with our North Sea oil .

That meme you posted missed out the most important part. England’s spending per cap was still much lower than ours. Oh. They also paid for imperial spending.

2399 2018-08-27 18:34:38 You should def avoid cum in your eyes & any type of oil cleanser as oil loosens up the glue— which makes them fall out sooner— which is a big waste of money

2414 2018-08-27 18:32:48 Canada also is (was) required to sell you oil under the previous agreement so enjoy importing that from places you guys will bomb to take it. Or the strong allies like Russia and Saudi Arabia (the just crucified and be headed some folks)

2421 2018-08-27 18:32:08 Exactly. I tell people that talk about USD as some kind of scam to get back to us after selling a barrel of oil on the open market. The day organized crime demands anything other than $$ we can begin looking at what may replace the USD as the dominant reserve currency.

2436 2018-08-27 18:29:40 The disappointing GDP number is traceable to the 4% decline in the oil sector from a 15% growth in Q1, 2018. #Nigeria is still an oil dependent economy.

2467 2018-08-27 18:26:16 No worries. We'll put tariffs on the fresh water that comes from us, your hydro and the 200M barrels of oil that cross the border daily. Perhaps, get your oil from Iran instead? We'll sell to China. Done.
2468 2018-08-27 18:26:15 Technically, it is renewable. Just like whale oil is. 
2469 2018-08-27 18:26:11 “Hosted by Chevron” is all I need to know about you jack wipes. How much money does @Twitter make from these #astroturfing oil goons?

2472 2018-08-27 18:25:42 why tf I just call and they said they don’t remove them  talking bout some just use oil and they’ll slide off -_____-
2473 2018-08-27 18:25:37 Dropped a box with 2 gallons of oil in it on my foot...I don’t think I’ve ever felt pain like this 
2474 2018-08-27 18:25:30 For youthful skin, mix 1 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup oatmeal, 1/4 cup mashed figs, 1 oz vanilla. Leave on 20 mins.
2475 2018-08-27 18:25:25 now am here thinking.. what will our first lady discuss with Melania Trump. i mean.. those 2 brains are like water and oil.

2479 2018-08-27 18:25:07 it was a fire bomb - there's loads of cool stuff with fire in this game. You can smash containers of oil and throw torches at them which is neat.
2480 2018-08-27 18:25:06 So many trains. I think there's two or three parallel tracks on that bridge too. Oil, coal, shipping containers... Sometimes passenger trains as well.
2481 2018-08-27 18:24:55 Probably some of the same people just go to flare!!!  points get noticed some sort of recognition I bet they were a little embarrassed when they found out it was frack free HH 
2482 2018-08-27 18:24:44 ahahahaha. Ahahahaha haha. We hack and corrupt every goddamn election that's in our interest. We rig or overthrow anyone in our way. Even if saudi Arabia had a democratic leader,we tossed him because lol oil. 

There's zero evidence the dnc hack was russia
2483 2018-08-27 18:24:39 짜쟌 형이 좋아요~왜~?그냥그냥그냥~
2484 2018-08-27 18:24:35 Yep. Oil production is too volatile because of militancy and a host of other issues (oil people call them asset integrity issues...go figure).

It’s so shameful we have reached this level actually. Imagine if Saudi oil output was swinging like our own. Markets will be a mess.
2485 2018-08-27 18:24:30 Did Mexico agree to pay for the wall?
Did North Korea halt their work on nuclear weapons?
Yeah, I thought so. I'll believe the great "trade deal" when it's signed and after experts verify it's not snake oil.  Until then, let's talk about whether cupcakes are dressed up muffins.

2487 2018-08-27 18:24:22 And if he is geniunely cool, how long will it be before someone takes him out. Ever hear of Prime Minister Mosadegh of Iran? Few people have. He was a good guy, but once he tried to nationalize the oil fields,,, well, he died under house arrest while the Shah took over.
2488 2018-08-27 18:24:16 Can’t expect results with “Placebo” dose. If capsuled fish oil is rancid , it was was rancid before capsuled. Function of capsules is to prevent rancidity. Eating fish is idealist with our polluted Oceans.  Not all capsuled products are created equal- wide range of quality.

2491 2018-08-27 18:23:55 Interference in the market economy, also I don't think Nigeria isnt a basket case. Also cost of production is diffrent, Saudi oil is profitable at $30 A bbl I think Venezuela needs closer $90

2495 2018-08-27 18:23:49 @SteakCattleRoll hi - do you use peanut oil, or generally how are you for peanut allergy sufferers? Trying to organise a place for a few friends to grab dinner next weekend 
2496 2018-08-27 18:23:37 I hope they cleaned up the fuel and oil from that “monster”?
2497 2018-08-27 18:23:27 You’re just trying to take the limelight off Sen. McCain with this snake oil salesman show. You’re not succeeding, Capt. Bonespurs bc McCain was a hero. I’d like to see you have gone thru what he did. My guess is you would’ve left early. 
My bone spurs required surgery!
2498 2018-08-27 18:23:23 Seems like only Arab mechanic smoke cigarettes while changing your oil, replacing a fuel pump,makes your really wanna think twice about negotiating for the price. He don’t even care about his life!! Fuck the 10 dollars You trynna save
2499 2018-08-27 18:23:14 These folks better not come at me with no expensive shit, I just came to get my oil changed. Dassit.

2501 2018-08-27 18:23:01 A major shipping route located between Oman and Iran where nearly one-third of the world's sea-traded oil passes through daily may become a new flashpoint after a top Iranian Navy general said Monday that the country has taken full control of the Strait of Hormuz.
2502 2018-08-27 18:22:31 When they know you at the local jiffy lube and they plug you on a oil change>>>>
2503 2018-08-27 18:22:24 I feel miserable all day. I am so sick of people who spread hate. I am sick of leaders of ours, that stir up hate and fear, put oil in the fire. I'm sick of people, that don't have reflected and independent thoughts. I'm sick of people, who can't discuss, just beeing offensive...

2507 2018-08-27 18:21:57 Bro everytime i get an oil change they tell me some new shit wrong with me car 
2508 2018-08-27 18:21:48 Good Afternoon everyone! I have Castor Oil in sizes 2oz and 8oz for $500 and $1500 respectively. Dm if interested. RT also to share to others. 
2509 2018-08-27 18:21:42 It’s so damn hot the Coconut Oil in my hair starting to melt 
2510 2018-08-27 18:21:29 Wales supplies your major cities with free water and cheap energy and Scotland gives you generous oil revenues. England would be up shit creek without us.
2511 2018-08-27 18:21:07 My day consists of new tires & a oil change... there’s always something that needs to be paid lol all I want to do is save
2512 2018-08-27 18:21:03 Not to rub salt in the would, but would it be more correctly phrased - dependent on the revenues from Libyan oil that belongs to Libyan citizens?
2513 2018-08-27 18:20:58 Will, I agree with you most of the time but you must be high. Sean Connery is the best Bond.

2525 2018-08-27 18:19:58 Seriously. I’ll fork ya. My grandparents would be spinning in their graves if I desecrated pasta with ranch. My pasta gets oil or tomato gravy (fresh made, never a jar).  Pesto or Alfredo sometimes. White wine sauce is good too. It’s a Sicilian thing.
2526 2018-08-27 18:19:46 It's all true though. Patience is a virtue.
2527 2018-08-27 18:19:30 By “All”, I meant financial services, construction and all other sectors in mining and quarrying apart from oil and gas. Not sure if that wasn’t clear.

2530 2018-08-27 18:19:19 Agreed; one of the most interesting technological developments I’ve seen in that space in ages. I like the idea of optimizing EOR for CO2 trapping rather than oil extraction also.
2531 2018-08-27 18:19:16 His fingers coolly traced along the vial of chocolate-scented oil.
2532 2018-08-27 18:19:12 It will be "GREAT".  Just like the North Korea deal.  Real ?? or more snake oil??

2549 2018-08-27 18:17:08 I think that’s the hardest part. I used to use the Jamaican and black castor oil products by Shea moisture. Now I use true by made beautiful products. Both are great though. Remembering to use oil is key though. Argon, grapeseed, and coconut are all good
2550 2018-08-27 18:17:07 @POTUS  Don't get involved if Iran closes the straights of hormuz -- let the Europeans and Saudis shed blood to keep their oil flowing. Have our refiners changes their processes to use light crude from the US

2597 2018-08-27 18:13:00 Line a wine glass with cling film, put literally a drop of oil in, crack your egg in, tie it off and put that in your rolling boil. Three and a half mins then fish it out and cut the film open and slide it out. Perfect every tome.
2598 2018-08-27 18:12:57 Ha! Here we are all living in the best economy that we've ever had, and you guys want nothing more than to be haters. If Hillary would have won, she was going to cut half the production of oil here in south texas. Now how would that effect Americans??????????????
2599 2018-08-27 18:12:36 All are relatively smaller contributors to GDP with the exception of oil.

Forcados & Bonny terminal were out for several weeks in Q2 hence the contraction in Oil.

The real poobahs to watch in Services are Trade & Telecoms which together make up 16% and 14% of GDP respectively.

— try to not have any soda or pop, but drink cucumber and lemon water instead! literal lifesaver  also, cut down on dairy for a week or two. yes! this will really help! don’t eat so much food with oil in it or is spicy. it can cause acne 
2606 2018-08-27 18:11:48 No prob, I'm just stupidly hungry all the time you see...so food minded things Just Happen. :/  Just get the proper version though, salted or not as you prefer, as for some reason they have some..."localized"...one made with Canola oil instead for some bizarre reason.
2607 2018-08-27 18:11:38 I use the skin so soft dry oil repellant. Love it!

2609 2018-08-27 18:11:16 Hi Nicole - Low sulphur fuel isn't necessarily not a heavy fuel oil. @cleanarctic are looking fwd to talk to @Maersk more about this. My colleague @Sian_Prior9 can provide more depth about HFO @WiredUK
2610 2018-08-27 18:11:15 #Obey me, I said. Release the oil. Screams came from the chamber, silence was the only thing left.

2613 2018-08-27 18:10:30 I'm a bit torn on the art style as well. Maybe it was just that bit of gameplay in the trailer, but it didn't feel as polished as the art in Wonder Boy. It almost seems like digitally uprezzed drawings or with an oil paint filter applied.

The trailer animation is amazing, tho.

2623 2018-08-27 18:09:38 I would never stop anyone from dropping a food item into burning hot oil. Ever.
2624 2018-08-27 18:09:29 I'm posting tons of stuff, But no one is seeing it. Need some fish oil pored on twitter, to stop the blockage.
2625 2018-08-27 18:09:22 Does that mean in any of its forms? Or just smoking? So if a person owns their condo, they’re not allowed to use it at all, even in oil form which has no impact on other residents, and instead have to drive to an approved location? I’d say “shortfall” is an understatement

2632 2018-08-27 18:08:20 I heard that they don’t like peppermint oil nor vinegar, so maybe if you mixed them evenly with some water in a spray bottle and sprayed around your house it will work, although you will probably find more insects around if you get rid of the spiders in your home. 
2633 2018-08-27 18:08:15 If we date I expect you to get my oil change , wash my car , and etc . While I’m making sure you eat, got gas , making errands for you , making sure you good and etc .

2646 2018-08-27 18:06:59 Always impressed with a products led rally; "smells like real demand" (as opposed to those always bullish but unreliable supply disruptions).

2651 2018-08-27 18:06:23 Using Palm oil for advantages such as shelf life only really helps you rather than the consumer. It means you can spend less man hours stocking fresh goods.
2652 2018-08-27 18:06:20 Dear Pharmacists of the world, please stop telling people they can OD on CBD oil. You. Can. NOT!

2672 2018-08-27 18:04:47 and 2-3 drops of tea tree oil which is a natural moisturizer and antiseptic to your sea salt rinse and dip. Then just keep cleaning it bout 3-6xs a day.

2702 2018-08-27 18:04:15 Gantt, on Tom Brady's trainer Alex Guerrero: He's a snake oil salesman who's aligned with the team's most important player, and the coaching staff isn't crazy about it.
2703 2018-08-27 18:03:43 También era un juego muy de saberte bien los truquillos (como p.e. matar a los bichos con el L.B. oil sin que se levantaran) y de tener suerte (p.e. que te saliera la típica puñalada envenenada en el Shadow Elf del barco).
2704 2018-08-27 18:03:39 What does semantics have to do with the total amounts for either EVs or fossil fuels? Hint: what applies to the goose, applies to the gander. Are you saying you're fine with the oil industry getting $160B, but not the $6B for EVs?
2705 2018-08-27 18:03:35 I did, went up to them like 3 times, I’m on break rn, I took my dads car for him to get his oil change

2711 2018-08-27 18:02:54 Wild oil of oregano, colloidal silver, and some Olive leaf extract. You can find everything on Amazon, works a million times better than pharmaceuticals, take it from my experience.

2715 2018-08-27 18:02:40 The fossil fuel industry gets an average of $15 billion in direct federal subsidies annually, says Oil Change International. @OilandEnergy reports 1st qtr 2018 profits for BP, Shell, ExxonMobil and Chevron totaled $16 billion. They can build their own wall.
2716 2018-08-27 18:02:39 #UKOG The flow rate suggests that the Kimmeridge limestone that sits below the Portland sandstone is naturally fractured rock, allowing the oil to move freely to the surface. Quite unique, As fuel prices rise and world leaders use energy as a bargaining tool. UK needs this.
2717 2018-08-27 18:02:33 In addition to lots of farmers who have stopped for fear of being abducted while those who brave it get their farms run over and devoured by cattle yet all I keep hearing is that the agricultural sector doing well as an alternative to the oil and gas sector.

2727 2018-08-27 18:01:46 Sunflower oil task la she did not judge that's a fact. I can say this if she is not allergic to sunflower oil I think sendrayan would not have mentioned it to Viji and I don't think Mumtaz is faking health issues if so BB would have revealed it like calcium incident.

2732 2018-08-27 18:01:12 Interesting. Again between this and now low carb diets may result in early death the news coming out is very confusing in nutrition. I believe MCT oil in 1 tablespoon daily cannot be “pure poison” thankyou for replying to me
2733 2018-08-27 18:00:55 Sir Richard how much damage did you have? Does the new rebuild reflect protection for the next?
Then can i pick your brain for ideas regarding a local problem we are having in the US with regards to local grabage companies dumping plasic and other oil based goods into landfills.

2753 2018-08-27 17:58:54 The Rohingya genocide is appalling. But what is worse is the neutered response to it. I guess Myanmar and the Rohingya people have nothing of gain (i.e. Oil) for the UN

2756 2018-08-27 17:58:45 Nigerians had to bare the brunt of such quagmire, prompting PMB to swing into action to negotiate and settle the outstanding oil subsidy owed. But here you are spewing ignorance and dropping junk unverified info.
2757 2018-08-27 17:58:30 I have to renew my license, change my oil, renew my registration, and get an inspection done this week because I am the king of procrastination. I won’t even blame it on being busy. Just pure procrastination.

2764 2018-08-27 17:57:11 Trump the carpetbagger sells snake oil containing all the ingredients of neo Confederate ideals. He has many buyers. Jefferson Beauregard Sessions eagerly implements new Jim Crow policies. Both of them, along with the GOP, partner with Putin to amplify & drive "sales".

2770 2018-08-27 17:56:17 1. He never looked like that Ken doll in the oil painting.  
2. He's a sexual predator who brags about assaulting women. He says when you're a celebrity, "they let you do it."
3. He's a racist, indecent adulterer and con artist who mocks war heroes and their families.

2777 2018-08-27 17:55:05 PMB bore the aftermath of his cluelessness which led to a subsidy fraud running into millions of dollars unpaid to the oil marketers thereby prompting them to truncate all effort at ensuring a steady supply of petroleum products during the early days of PMB admin.

2785 2018-08-27 17:54:19 So na Drs dey train quacks abi, the portrayal of the video is wrong but so are you, trying to rub oil on your neighbors.
2786 2018-08-27 17:54:10 When will you be have a town hall meeting in Houston sir. With the oil & gas sector being a very important part of Nigeria's economy, we in the diaspora can work as part of the solution, living in the oil capital.
2787 2018-08-27 17:54:10 vote against vonk getting 8p share, one would be to many, wouldn't  give him the oil droppings' off my dip stick
2788 2018-08-27 17:53:51 You have to wonder what other MbS policies will survive: disastrous war in Yemen; Qatar boycott; oil alliance with Russia and Trump bromance could all be reversed?
2789 2018-08-27 17:53:33 "2 years of oil changes are new" doesn't make sense
2790 2018-08-27 17:53:27 With a drop of oil the tick suffocates, dies and falls off very easily
2791 2018-08-27 17:53:26 Just take 1 capsule of Seven seas cod liver oil after dinner and after a month see the same result as in second pic
2792 2018-08-27 17:53:10 look at god  terry caught a flat & ended up with a job at a oil company 
2793 2018-08-27 17:52:59 If you're a guy and don't know how to change a tire or check your oil you're definitely a fruit cup
2794 2018-08-27 17:52:58 GSPC is a classical example of Gujarat model. No gas or oil produced till date but the company has taken loan of thousands of crores. It needs to be investigated.

2798 2018-08-27 17:52:05 Coconut oil, I use it as a treatment before I wash my hair and then use a little on the ends after washing.
2799 2018-08-27 17:52:05 Is it really worth the essential oil advice?
2800 2018-08-27 17:51:53 Take the baby to see a paediatrician so blood tests can be done. Could be eczema, his diet anything really. You can also try coconut oil. It's good with treating eczema.
2801 2018-08-27 17:51:52 Error: Turing machine needs oil.
2802 2018-08-27 17:51:46 He was the only president after@Reagan that has the guts and courage to tackle important issues heads on. The likes of Tax cuts, immigration,Paris BS accord, dig for oil, etc etc. without having to worry about the political consequences. He is doing what is good to our country
2803 2018-08-27 17:51:30 I have burnt all the midnight oil I had doing researches about This man Ruto and one of my findings is that the name Ruto and Land grabbing  has been mentioned more times than Raila  has gone to the Butcher to by Meat....
2804 2018-08-27 17:51:22 3>>1347460 Got one in the mail. Last headlamp I used was basically one step from an oil lamp so interested to see how they've came along.
2805 2018-08-27 17:51:21 No... this is an engineering grad who knows you cant change the oil pump specs on the fly of a running vehicle and think the vehicle will continue to run properly.

You can breed fruit flies to have extraordinary features...but they are still fruit flies at the end of the day.
2806 2018-08-27 17:51:20 I told my self that I won't engage a mediocre in an argument. I challenge you to put up any official document to substantiate your allegation. With oil price of over 100$/barrel,your buffon couldn't ensure steady supply of fuel neither where oil marketers dully compensated.
2807 2018-08-27 17:51:18 Peppermint oil (or tea), orange oil, stretching, & dancing.
2808 2018-08-27 17:51:15 I remember Trump telling him they where not buying Nigerian oil but would export genetically modified products to Nigeria...Buhari only smiled to that statement that sent chill down my spine.
2809 2018-08-27 17:51:14 Well, fundamentals have always been there, but with oil subsiding, institutional money is pouring back in (look at the reversal ALK made on earnings ). Both moving up off 200sma. Free cash flow is insane.

2813 2018-08-27 17:50:41 Why is your Lt. Gov. promoting offshore drilling in Florida AND down playing the BP oil spill? Offshore drilling was ‘off the table’ from your January 9 meeting with US Interior Sec. Ryan Zinke in TLH. Your Florida voters will not forget the effect of the BP oil spill. 
2814 2018-08-27 17:50:38 It is not just the oil price drop that caused oil and gas workers income loss. Other factors for the oil and gas workers income loss include new uncompetitive regulations for the oil industry and game theory economics governing oil investment.
2815 2018-08-27 17:50:11 I was so annoyed I have a 9:30am class but then I realized it’s my still life oil painting class and now I’m so excited to commute at 7am lol wow it’s gna be a great semester

2818 2018-08-27 17:49:31 Oho... Oil for 30 mins before shampoo.
Once a month, do a parlour based oil massage or hair spa. 
Always cover hair when traveling in the open to avoid pollution impact.
2819 2018-08-27 17:49:26 You are right, he giggled while being submerged in boiling oil  my boy is so powerful.
2820 2018-08-27 17:49:22 I'm exhausted my neighbors kept me up people over at all hours  cars from Mexico they all leak oil all over the street & my driveway cuz they turn around starting to wonder is he a coyote or what before you ask a coyote is someone who brings illegal aliens over from Mexico

2828 2018-08-27 17:48:27 And btw I bet your one of those people thinking we went to war with Iraq cause of weapons of mass destruction. Didn't find any. But Iraq was trying to take Kuwaits oil. Both OPEC. You know what that would have done to your gas. Start a war. I'm the dummy.
2829 2018-08-27 17:48:26 Perhaps it’s this recent Full Moon, but I have been feeling so lethargic & exhausted lately.

Gratitude to my Peppermint oil for always boosting me up. 

What are your go-to Energy Boosters?
2830 2018-08-27 17:48:26 Two possible reasons why the fish oil had no effect: 1 - too small doses: nobody tracked the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio, but that's what really counts. 2 - perhaps the capsules weren't stored properly so that the oil got spoiled. Impossible to tell by swallowing a capsule.
2831 2018-08-27 17:48:07 He is and has been a fraud from day one, 72 years worth hit the doorstep of the WH via people who believed the snake oil salesman was their savior.  I don't know how you make these people see the light but electing better candidates is a start.
2832 2018-08-27 17:47:50 trump never used his money for anything.  He’s the guy who says, “I don’t have my wallet with me.  Pay for lunch and I’ll catch you later.”  trump is the ultimate snake oil salesman.

2838 2018-08-27 17:46:54 He is seen by some as a snake oil salesman and by others as a distraction to the team. He's made some unorthodox claims in the past and has encouraged Patriots players to train at his facility/using his methods instead of the team's. At least that's how I understand it

2873 2018-08-27 17:44:11 I’m pretty sure buying an inflated price oil pipeline counts as sucking up to the oil industry

2898 2018-08-27 17:41:48 Kurdistan had none of the challenges of Iraq. Was gifted money from federal budget, sold oil illegally, & they still can't pay salaries on time or build infrastructure. Iraq does. Kurdistan was already failing and now that it has real challenges will spiral into deeper recession.

2935 2018-08-27 17:38:41 Not really sure how that gets judged. Is it financially risky compared to not mitigating climate change? What you judge as immensely risky was easily handled by France back in the 80s in order to address the risk of future oil shocks

2946 2018-08-27 17:36:55 Hi Max.  The supplement industry is full of people trying to make a profit by making embellished claims about what they are selling.  Basically anyone who sells OTC items could be called a snake oil salesman by your standards.
2947 2018-08-27 17:36:55 Its an oil thing  we wont get it. And by it i mean any of the benefits.
2948 2018-08-27 17:36:42 It is currently Wet° outside and I’m getting my oil changed like wow guys thanks for doing the Lord’s work!
2949 2018-08-27 17:36:39 Doesn’t change the fact that you claim to be a quality shop but you’re selling stuff that contains cheap products like palm oil. Since when does a scone need palm oil?
2950 2018-08-27 17:36:36 Don't expect oil from an olive that is unwilling to be pressed...  wine from a grape that refuses to be crushed... or fruit from a seed that is unwilling to die.  The process must be endured so the purpose can be fulfilled!  #Breakers #Soilshakers

2957 2018-08-27 17:35:44 Nothing shows just how ill informed the anti resource sector is than when you ask them about importing foreign oil. They are so blinded by ensuring that our resources are not developed that they would rather import oil from countries that still behead people than buy our own oil

2966 2018-08-27 17:34:33 Actually, a boycott is not recommended because palm oil is such a high producing crop. When planted and farmed properly it can produce far more oil on less soil than grapeseed. And #rspo certified ensures that the people working are treated and paid  fairly

How do you do the liver cleanse?

It involves Epsom salt, grapefruit juice & olive oil. If your colon is blocked where your liver dumps into it, you could possibly die from this so I won't say specifics but you can find it.

2986 2018-08-27 17:31:26 Yes! You will continue to feel better if you keep in mind that just eating Vegan is not necessarily healthy as many Vegan items include refined flours/sugar and loads of oil. Focus on eating Whole Plant Foods/no oil.
2987 2018-08-27 17:31:25 Best way to do it is, put two pinches of salt in the oil, then, cover the pot with the lid. Make sure it is air tight. 

Then, time it. Bleach for ten minutes on low heat. Or twelve! ON LOW HEAT! It won't smoke at all. Try it and let me know.

2998 2018-08-27 17:30:13 Not to mention, their only export is oil. We import about 3.5% of our crude oil from RU. They are not a leading economy in any way. Definitely not when it comes to impact on US. Sorry. I would much rather have the US deal with countries that don’t attack us every chance they have
2999 2018-08-27 17:30:08 Are you kidding me? Right in the middle of berezaa losing his father to cancer, you think it's a good idea to ask for CODES?! Jesus, go back to Oil Simulator.

3015 2018-08-27 17:27:37 I don't think we are saying it's apples to apples.  Amrn composition is very different to "regular" fish oil--we're all aware.  And certainly it is further apart from ESPR's drug.  But the issue is whether their CVOT will move the goal posts for $espr ?
3016 2018-08-27 17:27:24 Julian assange was smart when he ran to Ecuador. You wanna know why? Ecuador is OPEC. He has some protect by way of oil. Trump begging Saudi to increase oil because of Iran and Venezuela. Both countries he's trying to crush now and change regimes. So he can get oil back.

Just make sure you get something high quality and full spectrum usually works much better

3048 2018-08-27 17:23:38 Will you investigate the Obama regime's handling of the Gulf Oil Spill? His drone murders? His record setting deportations?
Nope.
Cause in truth you're just a partisan hack flavor of the month.
3049 2018-08-27 17:23:35 You may need more fat then, like vegetable oil (most recipes I've tried use butter and oil). You also may be over beating the batter.  Leave it a bit lumpy otherwise you create air pockets in the batter and it will get cakey.
3050 2018-08-27 17:23:22 I promise aint no better feeling then shaving and putting coconut oil all over you 
3051 2018-08-27 17:23:19 And I summon the dignified spirit of Mark Twain when I tell you
I take great delight in hearing of his passing
Please send along condolences from the thousands who would have willingly died to keep oil free in honor of his name
3052 2018-08-27 17:23:16 You have to have the right proportion between oil and eggs for the right emulsion. And a good mixer.
3053 2018-08-27 17:23:06 some in my neck of the woods mainly leak but the better question is do we have petrol and oil. anyway freezing the personal assets of the royal family of Saudi shouldn't hit normal Saudi Arabia and an arms embargo may force both Saudi and Iran to spend money on better things.
3054 2018-08-27 17:23:03 Grassroots Politics and Oil Culture in Venezuela: The Revolutionary Petro State by Iselin Asedotter is a good book on Venezuelan politics and the economics of oil in a socialist country sorry for not specifying

3058 2018-08-27 17:22:04 @ragipsoylu A question, the oil of northern ıraq that we sold from ceyhan, we did not pay the share of Iraq Government. They went to court in 2014 at Paris Arbitraon Court! Macron supported Le Point which declared our President as dictator. France also supports Armenian .... so?
3059 2018-08-27 17:22:03 You are a merchant! Arabs to be specific when the bump into a well of oil!
3060 2018-08-27 17:21:58 Came for an oil change and ended up having to replace a whole ass tire 
3061 2018-08-27 17:21:49 I think it's silly to say if one industry like oil starts doing poorly the entire nation falls into famine, runaway inflation and starvation. 

How do you explain the fact that most countries have no oil reserves yet are nevertheless doing well.
3062 2018-08-27 17:21:45 Looks like he hit the CBD oil early today.

3065 2018-08-27 17:21:17 And already have Iraq OPEC Libya dead OPEC. Pipeline from Texas to Canada under eminent domain. U S wants a better processing deal. China #1 importer of oil. Saudi and Russia want to switch to the backed by gold. It's not about tariffs. It's oil.
3066 2018-08-27 17:21:14 Congratulations on killing coal.

Your oil & gas is next on the chopping block.

Geothermal, EVs, onshore wind, hydropower, li-ion batteries, nuclear, offshore wind, solar PV, biomass, wave energy, etc will replace you.
3067 2018-08-27 17:21:05 In July of 2017, I predicted that oil would rebound from $46 to $70 
& the USA would get hit by 2+ hurricanes, both predictions were accurate. 
I tell people what I can when I can without throwing anyone under the bus.
I highly recommend ppl in south Texas b ready 4 mid september
3068 2018-08-27 17:20:57 But Saudi oil production was increased to put pressure on the US due to America s shale oil resource as US became net energy exporter,Venezuela was a fucked up little fish in a big pond nd chavez messed up

3080 2018-08-27 17:19:36 your pic is fab, thanks for sharing.  cannabis oil works wonders for all kinds of maladies - ask your doctor if cannabis oil is right for you - not a spokesperson for any company, i've just found it works on chronic stuff, it's subtle but it helps

3082 2018-08-27 17:19:34 Wasn't olive oil also problematic when heated? I remember something about possibly hazardous byproducts.
3083 2018-08-27 17:19:19 Once a pore becomes clogged, it traps skin oil inside. Bacteria grows in this oil and can cause an inflammatory response in the skin.

3094 2018-08-27 17:18:12 There was no oil or water.... I used butter if that’s what you mean?

3096 2018-08-27 17:18:07 How much is oil currently generating? The current decline noticed in our GDP as reported by @nigerianstat was attributed to the ill performance of the oil sector. The govt has focused on non-oil sectors which have been reported to be doing well and contributing to growth...
3097 2018-08-27 17:17:57 Giving Saudi weapons to kill people in Yemen   Saudi OPEC. Threaten Qatar OPEC killed nafta with Canada where we get most of our oil from and Mexico. Put sanctions on turkey cause they don't want to buy U S weapons but Russian. I know what I'm talking about buddy.
3098 2018-08-27 17:17:53 Yeah, Cheney is a real jerk. I have no issue criticizing him. He’s a war monger and definitely got a lot of people killed for wars that were about oil interest, not freedom. That guy can eat a bag of dicks.
3099 2018-08-27 17:17:31 I am unaware of fish oil proving much beyond making manufacturers and distributors a lot of money.

We all suspect it is healthy and safe. So better than a lot of the supplement industry.
3100 2018-08-27 17:17:26 With the kind of questions you ask it’s hella obviously you don’t read or watch the news. Did you know of the $6 billion nnpc owed (cash calls) how much are we making from oil in comparison to previous administrations? Google that too
3101 2018-08-27 17:17:24 Tom Brady doesn't want to take questions about his relationship and business dealings with a known snake oil salesmen. This dude is way more than a simple trainer.

3103 2018-08-27 17:17:13 if ya wanna get freaky, try lightly frying the rice in a a little bit of oil until it’s lightly golden. THEN add the boiling water and aromatics & cover. this is the best rice imo but it’s also not as healthy lol

3122 2018-08-27 17:14:50 Oh man if only we didn't give away oil royalties like they were nothing when the conservatives were in power for 44 years. Like we could have invested that money instead of giving it away as tax breaks?

3125 2018-08-27 17:14:45 The point was trump wants Iran out saying their supporting terrorist. Russia is supporting Syria. Iran was invited to stay by Syria. Trump is saying nuclear deal. Trump is trying to control OPEC oil in the region. Iraq Iran OPEC members. He wants to invade Venezuela OPEC.
3126 2018-08-27 17:14:38 I’m contemplating should I text this boy now because I just realized that’s free oil changes and allat 
3127 2018-08-27 17:14:33 It looks like the vibrant sunshine makes wrestling even more challenging than oil. Such an idyllic place to rest...but of course they know how to stay active while enjoying the place.
3128 2018-08-27 17:14:15 Regardless, he’s done more than enough to suck up the oil industry and he (or any other prime minister if Canada) is virtually powerless when it comes to controlling the world oil market

3133 2018-08-27 17:14:07 This is why I usually have my dad take my car to get oil changes. I came to get an oil change not to hear anything else that you think ima pay you to fix when I’m Hispanic and I know ppl who will do it for the low lmao

3136 2018-08-27 17:13:57 They are just another foreign funded exoterrorist organization wanting to destroy our oil industry.
3137 2018-08-27 17:13:47 We can only hope, if not we are going to have a bunch of unemployed pot smokers until 2019. At least we have our oil and pipelines, oh wait......

3139 2018-08-27 17:13:25 Seems Lucas is on a jolly up to the Arctic, no doubt transported by fossil fuelled planes, ships and vehicles, will rely on plastic (i.e. oil) based products to keep her warm and safe, will use fossil fuelled heating and food made with fossil fuelled systems. What a joke!!

If you knew the real story on cancer research and the pre-historic treatments that patient's put their faith in you would be sick? How many slides ranked from 1-10 are read wrong my radiologists and women are treated for cancer?

3148 2018-08-27 17:12:57 US cheaply leases the people's land to oil companies, who ruin it, leave it unuseable and then charge us too much for oil that belongs to the people anyway. Only a few billionaires benefit..we just pay, and live with the consequences of paying to clean up their mess.
3149 2018-08-27 17:12:49 LPG refilling is not rocket science. But its the multinational oil companies like Total etc who bribe the energy regulators so that they can sustain their extortion cartels which sell cooking at very high prices. Cartels also want to have the universal filling tips to changed.

3156 2018-08-27 17:11:50 Tips from Houston USA Oil Technologies:
What is the maintenance of oil wells? It is an intervention of vital importance to change the horizons taking full advantage of the energy of the deposit, improve the recovery of hydrocarbons and maintain or increase their production.
3157 2018-08-27 17:11:32 Great piece! It’s unfortunate that we still have “doctors” calling coconut oil poison. Maybe if glyphosate infused coconuts were used. Thanks a million for your work!
3158 2018-08-27 17:11:28 Venezuela: The price of oil dropped and it ruined their economy and their currency was overinflated
South Africa: the right's scapegoat on white genocide without actually knowing the situation in that country. The whites were treated better than blacks with education & medicine.
3159 2018-08-27 17:11:22 Looool. One of the biggest problems is that Naija people don't end up with egg on their faces. We eat the egg and use the oil as body cream and repeat our folly.

3162 2018-08-27 17:11:07 Whatever one's concerns may be, they're quite possibly moot. Bickering over whose land, whose oil, when will the rich share from their pile, are you a red or a blue, who killed Kennedy, who is the enemy, how is the real economy, it's all just vanity, all for nought. It'll change.

3170 2018-08-27 17:10:06 It’s really cute that you think the USA “needs” Canada. We “use” your resources, oil included. But “need” you? Nah. We’ve got the land, the food, the farmers, the oil, nat gas, gold, on & on. CN is a convenience. Trudy-O has choices: stay or go.

3173 2018-08-27 17:09:19 it’s honestly just funny how bc every person that looks at my car they say “well with the oil leak your belt could slip off and with the gas leak your whole car could blow up” LMAO IM OVER IT PLS BLOW UP
3174 2018-08-27 17:09:18 Yes. Common sense and liberalism?? Oil and water...
3175 2018-08-27 17:09:17 Delusional thinking again.is the world's 5th largest exporter of petroleum oil & U.S. is the top importer ofpetroleum oil. The U.S. imports $38.9 billion usd worth of oil per year &;imports 98.05% of all of  oil exports. Another big Canadian export commodity is Wheat.
3176 2018-08-27 17:09:16 WTI oil at $68.80/barrel, near unchanged.

She just needs one.  Just one Doctor to advise she try this.

3 studies prove it will help.

Bring on the studies!

3180 2018-08-27 17:08:36 Oil revenue drop
3181 2018-08-27 17:08:28 Unfortunately, Coop nailed it. I change the oil in my car more often than they change oil in their general purpose fryer.
3182 2018-08-27 17:08:09 It’s interesting then that the only non independent country within the EU,
which also happens to be its biggest oil producer, has the biggest deficit.

3197 2018-08-27 17:06:12 Nah, it's all good. It worked out, especially since I was 30 mins late to my appointment anyway  plus I get free oil changes at my dealership.
3198 2018-08-27 17:06:07 Good quality oil should never freeze in the container, u prolly need to change ur brand
3199 2018-08-27 17:06:06 And exactly who would buy Canadian oil? We can barely get anything to market today because of a lack of pipeline capacity. Doubt the US cares about timber or electricity.

This is amazing
3202 2018-08-27 17:05:27 We are subsidizing everything from oil, electricity etc, even the CBN is giving loans and Sovereign wealth fund is doing fertilizer. The banks are just enjoying doing shashe banking....

3210 2018-08-27 17:04:52 Reuters- Brazil's oil regulator says Petrobras' Paulinia refinery should resume operations this week. Five diesel cargoes, one aviation gasoline cargo to be imported  to offset shutdown
3211 2018-08-27 17:04:47 You don't have the oil reserves in texts to make up the 40 percent of the oil you use that's why you import it
3212 2018-08-27 17:04:42 Its legit just oil. Taste no dif than butter. Just toasts more evenly
3213 2018-08-27 17:04:36 Just heard from official sources that dhaba owners extracting oil from sacrificial animal wastes to prepare food in. Be careful, guys #NayaPakistan #yuck
3214 2018-08-27 17:04:34 Hahaha, don't forget Midnight Oil bruv 
3215 2018-08-27 17:04:32 This doesn’t really apply to vegans. It’s all about melting point and animal fats are solid at body temperature, coconut oil is not.
3216 2018-08-27 17:04:26 Dependence on Russian gas is overstated.  It’s the cheapest yes, but it’s a huge global market in gas oil. We can pay slightly more for gas on global market.
3217 2018-08-27 17:04:22 いんじゃね
3218 2018-08-27 17:04:21 So you want me to say "Hey honey, today some oil industry asshole put the planet in a microwave..."
3219 2018-08-27 17:04:03 We did some interesting anomaly detection on oil rigs! To me, at least - but it was all decision trees (rule-based logic) for lithology, drilling parameters, and hardware. 

Would that be interesting?
3220 2018-08-27 17:03:53 Well get use to black outs we supply 1/3rd of your electricity and 40 percent of your oil
3221 2018-08-27 17:03:51 First, the Brussels sprouts:
Place them on your cutting board, and cut them from the top down, in half (you might compare is with how you cut mushrooms in two identical halfs, too).
Then prepare them in a frying pan with some oil.
The flat surface of both halves will get roasted
3222 2018-08-27 17:03:44 Immediate appeal!?

3225 2018-08-27 17:03:39 Ironic that this person explains discrimination by discriminating against oil and Americans...
3226 2018-08-27 17:03:35 Today I found out that Greek athletes used to slather themselves in oil, compete and then scrape off the oil and sweat and sell it to fans (#gloios). TBH idk why I haven’t thought of that.

3229 2018-08-27 17:03:20 You say that you are clean come to me and buy oil that you be clean for your words speak as a double-minded man let the word of God pour in your heart as oil and it burned God's will when you live in Christ Jesus no condemnation in Christ Romans 8 1
3230 2018-08-27 17:03:18 I was buying CBD oil and also CBD Vape juice in Tallahassee, and smoke-able Hemp too, we had a shop. Not a Marijuana shop, they had strict dispensaries for those. I've bought CBD oil in Alabama at vape shops or GNC type stores. No problem.

3236 2018-08-27 17:02:28 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
3237 2018-08-27 17:02:25 That’s a rather natural product unless you got the Mint Chocolate flavor. We have some flavored with Berry & Peppermint both as well as cold-pressed Orange Oil, Black Seed Oil & other’s too!
3238 2018-08-27 17:02:25 Lol — you know that HALF of US oil is secured due to NAFTA? You know when that agreement goes there will be no energy security? You are being conned. God you are clueless.

3240 2018-08-27 17:02:15 Came out and saw a flat. Went to the dealer and dude told me I need an alignment, new brakes on the front and back, 2 new tires, oil change, and new brake fluid. Shit fucked up my whole morning. I was thinking sub $100 and now it’s $1000
3241 2018-08-27 17:02:02 But clean energy is isolationist in nature. Oil and coal are commodities controlled by the elites. The sun and wind are not. Doesn’t it make more sense for those who have a commodity to keep us dependent on that commodity?
3242 2018-08-27 17:01:56 Frogs and toads are the same animal! They just shapeshift!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!

The snake oil salesmen isn’t very verse with phone operating systems.

3264 2018-08-27 16:59:58 Have you read the Venezuelan story? It is beyond the 90 secs video. Its the result of subsidization with oil money and demonization of private capital.
3265 2018-08-27 16:59:40 i think they’re all essentially the same thing! as long as it’s pure rosehip oil and not mixed with something else then it should work just the same :)
3266 2018-08-27 16:59:15 Venezuela won't be able to pay in oil. They can't pump it! Less than 20 years after running oil companies off & replacing native mangers with political cronies, production is dropping - & ownership of Citgo may be lost to lawsuits in the US over expropriation

3268 2018-08-27 16:59:05 Been sitting in a “10 minute oil change” line for 30 minutes. There were only 2 cars ahead of me when I pulled up. 1 in the bay, 1 in line. 

There are still 2 cars ahead of me.
3269 2018-08-27 16:58:35 Wes Shelton is a Shell reference to oil and gas most likely attached to construction in my school. There is an Adelson reference to a Sheldon attached to the casinos and my neighbor next to it in my neighborhood.
3270 2018-08-27 16:58:31 1. Belfort doesn't have more than a basic understanding of Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies.

3272 2018-08-27 16:58:24 Ppl are going crazy over High Diesel Prices.
Do you know back in June 15 ‘04 it cost Rs 22.74 and in Jan 29 ‘09 increased to Rs 30.86 and in Dec 21 ‘13 rose to Rs 53.78
details from indian oil website for Delhi during @INCIndia 
Considering today scenario Diesel prices still gud
3273 2018-08-27 16:58:23 कांग्रेस govt में cruid oil महंगा था तब भी पेट्रोल सस्ता बेचा

मोदी सरकार में सस्ता होने के बावजूद महंगा क्यो ?

चमचो अधूरी जानकारी को पूरा करो, कांग्रेस ने 1,42,000 करोड़ के बांड्स(उधार) लिया जो इंटरेस्ट समेत आज 2 लाख cr हो गया है । उसे भारत को ही चुकाना है 2026 तक समझे ? 
3274 2018-08-27 16:58:21 This is reassuring, Liz. I have a life/long aversion to fish. I thought that fish oil was an adequate replacement. After these recent revelations, I’ve been at a loss.

3294 2018-08-27 16:55:30 Carrie and Erin Frasier were tied to a Wes or sew backwards and that ties to John and FL and the PAC NW with history references and oil and gas/water references. The Wes lived in my neighborhood and appeared later TCU tying to OK and T Boone Pickens.

3298 2018-08-27 16:55:04 Well time to turn off the 40 percent of the oil you use, 1/3rd of your electricity, close the land link to alaska  also no water to the entire eaten part of your country. No medial isotopes since Canada is the world supplier of those also no potash which is used in fertiliser.

3303 2018-08-27 16:54:41 Try adjusting the level of oil and water you use.  More oil will be a "fudgier" brownie; more water, for more of a cake-like brownie.
3304 2018-08-27 16:54:40 You use the oil they supply? If so shut up. Big oil like to supply oil to people who don’t want it? Doesn’t seem like a smart business.
3305 2018-08-27 16:54:39 Is it like an oil stain?

3319 2018-08-27 16:52:25 @fayedsouza Madam, even in UAE price without taxes is higher which itself is a oil producer. 
3320 2018-08-27 16:52:14 Oil and gas stocks only represent a small fraction of the overall fund. But what I find more interesting is whether these oil derived sovereign funds can last, surely they’ll be picked off for climate mitigation in years to come?

3332 2018-08-27 16:50:37 They're afraid from disclosing total oil reserves...which as I guess are much larger than they officially declare. These huge reserves could crumble the internation oil price due to the large supply. Their main income is from oil, so no ipo for the next 150 years I guesd

3337 2018-08-27 16:50:23 He has no morals. He is a snake oil salesman from my home state. We can only hope that the truth will out and he will be gone soon.
3338 2018-08-27 16:50:22 Well, for one thing, their oil is basically glorified asphalt. Also, US sanctions are probably not helping. It is sort of like blaming Cuba's economic backwardness on Communsim when US sanctions are really to blame. Cf. China is doing pretty good.
3339 2018-08-27 16:50:06 @raneyaronson A group called BullSugar just endorsed an R candidate with an F voting record on environment who takes oil money. I fear they don't know what they are doing. Their endorsements are all over the place. A true env group would have just said "None meet our criteria".
3340 2018-08-27 16:50:05 Nice bit of product placement . I've treated it with 3 coats of Barrettine and 3 coats of Danish oil. The couple I gave it to are worried it will get rain stained (bless!) but I would just let it weather... teak oil sounds good

3342 2018-08-27 16:49:59 My guess is that if you are seeking stamina, you probably want fuel for your workouts. 2 dates + tablespoon of coconut oil fuels your body for 1.5-2 hours of rigorous activity.

After that, you gotta refuel and take in electrolytes.

3347 2018-08-27 16:49:30 Mexico does get lots of special provisions in the energy part of the NAFTA agreements. Partly because it’s energy (including oil and gas) markets aren’t as evolved as the US’ and Canada’s.
3348 2018-08-27 16:49:24 V sorry. Also, I nearly forgot to mention oil. So yes, oil is v v imp.

3354 2018-08-27 16:48:36 Venezuela has almost no foreign currency reserves. The new currency the Sovereign went from 60 for a dollar a week ago to 84 today. The oil industry is a shambles headed by a soldier with no experience. I keep asking @maxkeiser how the crypto Petro is doing. No reply....
3355 2018-08-27 16:48:11 As it gets colder you might find your skin dries out more outside, a really good tip is to use coconut oil at night. You can use it to take makeup off, cook with ir or use it as pre-hair mask and wash it off.

3368 2018-08-27 16:46:19 I agree, things need to change in order to have unity. Governments of the world are filled with greed and corruption. They are controlled by money, oil, religion. Unity is a good thing. Unfortunately as it stands, the way our world operates prevents, unity.

3370 2018-08-27 16:46:16 a fair share of North Sea Oil? Seriously?
3371 2018-08-27 16:46:15 Venezuela has been particularly vulnerable as its oil dominated economy gave the illusion of success when despite economic mismanagement when oil prices were high. When oil prices fell its mismanagement was exposed.

3385 2018-08-27 16:44:34 @BuyLegaIMeds @CloudN9neSyrup it’s been almost 2 wks. I’ve emailed twice and called without an answer. My vape pens came, one has something in the oil and the other would not shut off,got so hot it burned my bfs lips. I want a refund or some kind of credit. I don’t have $ to blow
3386 2018-08-27 16:44:31 After the election (and your inevitable smackdown), enjoy your life as a snake oil salesperson.
3387 2018-08-27 16:44:31 Here’s why people can’t save: my house keeps breaking (roof, oil tank, hot water heater, you name it) college, MEDICAL bills, food costs, helping parents & adult kids, car repair costs (holy shit),  we needed a new septic - $14,000 with leech fields.  My dog needed an X-ray $385
3388 2018-08-27 16:44:29 oh also! if you wanted to take a painting class sometime i would so go with you. i've never done oil painting
3389 2018-08-27 16:44:16 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
3390 2018-08-27 16:44:09 NextGen wants america to be dependent on foreign oil which lacks any environmental oversight.
3391 2018-08-27 16:43:53 Fair point. Inflation is mainly due to oil prices. Something that seems unavoidable. Wages stagnating has been an issue for many administrations, same could be said for rent. It’s was 1% heaven under Obama too. Trump has had to take on that legacy.

3393 2018-08-27 16:43:49 Very nice  I use teak oil for outdoor bare wood, 3 coats will last well and easy to re-treat. Use Ronseal myself but other oils are available 
3394 2018-08-27 16:43:46 iya  ni then ku sedang pakai bio oil juga.. semoga cepat kembali ke kondisi  kulit normal u,u
3395 2018-08-27 16:43:45 That one even uses "Snake Oil" in the name and a clown emoji. They don't hide themselves, folks. Good use of discernment here. Fake Q supporters trying to make us look bad, cultish, or intolerant of questions are working for the ENEMY. Anyone who follows Q asks ALL the questions.

3398 2018-08-27 16:43:42 Do you have coconut oil?
3399 2018-08-27 16:43:42 Don't forget; the Aussies sold those flammable oil secreting palm trees to California and takes part in burning down part of the state yearly. Aussies are top shitposters by far. Took them 100 years to get pull that off.
3400 2018-08-27 16:43:37 Fish oil supplements aren't some magic cure all .. theyre merely adjuncts to regular exercise and balanced dietary practices and a modest lifestyle.
3401 2018-08-27 16:43:32 Verified: Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page met with representatives of Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft.
3402 2018-08-27 16:43:21 Should coconut oil be used on the face? #GirlTalkZA
3403 2018-08-27 16:43:16 Girl actually pwede siya. Hahahaha you can also mix it with olive oil hahaha nakita ko sa youtube. 
3404 2018-08-27 16:43:16 She needs the work boots and oil stains to match
3405 2018-08-27 16:43:14 Tis I who must thank you!

I sincerely hope that the current occupant of the Oval Office
and/or his minions do not decide to defile all of our national parks
by turning them into oil and/or fracking fields and/or "resorts".
3406 2018-08-27 16:42:50 I agree.

3408 2018-08-27 16:42:49 Thanks for the advice. If UAE wants India to buy more of its oil then it should stop meddling with matters internal to India.
3409 2018-08-27 16:42:43 Black seed oil with honey one tea spoon should do the trick, but to see really good results do it for 3 consecutive nights
3410 2018-08-27 16:42:30 I’m liking your tyre company conspiracy theory. They’re probably in cahoots with the oil giants.
3411 2018-08-27 16:42:14 Just in time for spike in oil prices.
3412 2018-08-27 16:42:14 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
3413 2018-08-27 16:41:56 I bought a can of olive oil spray for cooking. Hate it. I'll use it up but won't buy any more.
3414 2018-08-27 16:41:52 Pundits hawajasema is the oil rushing the white man to Kenia
3415 2018-08-27 16:41:43 Cover up sex abuse, wring hands over "climate change". Cover up for priests who rape children, but tear after oil executives. Gotcha.

3417 2018-08-27 16:41:37 We woke up took my Jeep to get an oil change then came back and napped again and were still sleepy wth! 
3418 2018-08-27 16:41:27 I am eyewitness of sikh massacre in Palam area where many local congress leaders were seen instigating the mob. One congress leader Balwan Khokhar has been convicted for 1984 riots. He was one of kerosene oil depot and an aide of Sajjan Kumar.

3421 2018-08-27 16:40:57 I know so many girls who buy cars and just drive that mf  no oil change, new tires, windshield wipers  and honestly it’s hilarious
3422 2018-08-27 16:40:49 Not so happy to answer questions though.
Again I ask
why would Westminster give scots a fair deal when they gave nobody ever a fair deal?
Why would they pay 13BN for no return for scots
Mind don't mention oil in yer answer
3423 2018-08-27 16:40:46 #AUDUSD = #OIL but this time correlation dosent work! maybe oil will be crash soon!
3424 2018-08-27 16:40:46 When oil was $150/ a barrel n now it is under $100/
3425 2018-08-27 16:40:46 GUYS THIS GUY IS A RACIST IMMA STEAL YOUR OIL
3426 2018-08-27 16:40:31 Went for an oil change today...didn't know how to pop the hood
3427 2018-08-27 16:40:27 #Outnumbered how could a dope like Maxine Waters be chair of the financial committee? She wants to nationalize the oil industry for pete's sake
3428 2018-08-27 16:40:25 Hope you like losing 40 percent of your oil when we shut off the tap
3429 2018-08-27 16:40:25 Is anyone surprised that the Woke Pope Francis has been harder on oil executives than on sexual abusers within his own ranks? That’s because Leftism rots the moral compass.

A few oil wells worth trillions in profit.

Who cares about millions who die in wars and long term damage to the world when you are an American
3446 2018-08-27 16:38:36 You haven't answered my question. 

What does  Ireland have that Scotland doesn't? It's not population, it's not oil wealth so what is it?

Ireland has a publicly funded health service so I don't understand yr point.

You could opt for Norway, Finland, Denmark instead if you like
3447 2018-08-27 16:38:34 First coconut oil and now booze? There's is no 'safe' level of screen time, flying or driving, and any combo of those could do you in, but you're not going to stop them anytime soon.

3461 2018-08-27 16:37:22 Please update the resolution, as now a days oil companies take time to solve the problems faced by consumers
3462 2018-08-27 16:37:19 It's law of the pack vs humanism– the pro-humanism of those who honor respect for the life, liberty and property of others is the wellspring of Americanism. The anti-humanism of Leftist-Liberal Utopians is the law of the pack, using politics and fear to demonize business and oil.
3463 2018-08-27 16:37:18 I don't agree with the President on much, but putting the flag back at full mast then flying a second one with the word "OWNED" painted across it in blood and oil is punk as hell
3464 2018-08-27 16:37:16 .....This Agreement stipulates on amalgamation of the assets and activities of both Eni Oil and Mellitah Gas, to start effective as of 01/01/2008.
3465 2018-08-27 16:37:15 I paint +-1 oilpainting a year. And I feel like using oil paint right now. What to make though.. but I feel like using an a2 sized canvas. Hmm
3466 2018-08-27 16:37:12 They based our future on oil. Thanks goodness we voted no. We will do the same again if required. I’m not convinced you even read the failed white paper.
3467 2018-08-27 16:37:03 Who has a current chart of Shanghai oil contracts out several months? What does the trajectory of the volume look like?
3468 2018-08-27 16:37:01 Damn on who linked the price of the dollar with oil
3469 2018-08-27 16:36:57 True  who needs oil in their car anyway 
3470 2018-08-27 16:36:55 I agree. We NEVER say don't ask questions. That's where all this started. If you want to see shilling, go look at my thread regarding what happens to us if the white hats fail. I just said if they fail, we get visits from the thought police for posting Q stuff. Got megashilled.
3471 2018-08-27 16:36:45 I find it so freaking funny and cute when my husband doesn’t tell me he uses my products, but he comes in smelling like a whole lot of argan oil and Garnier hair products & when I ask him, he looks like a little boy who got caught doing something bad 
3472 2018-08-27 16:36:44 Water coconut oil, Shea butter makes it so much easier
3473 2018-08-27 16:36:43 Think before you write .. read this:
Mellitah Oil & Gas B.V Libyan Branch was established by General Peoples Committee Resolution No. 253 for the year 2008 issued on 21/04/2008 in accordance to an agreement concluded between the National Oil Corp. & Eni North Africa on 16/10/2007

Much better now.
3475 2018-08-27 16:36:25 How does one ensure cooking oil doesn't freeze in the jerican? I've tried changing oils but this cold weather in the village won't let me prosper . 

Every time I need to cook I have to warm the jerican on the burner so as to liquefy the oil. 

Help!!

3481 2018-08-27 16:36:12 Yes  for now the $ will remain the reserve currency.

But that does not and will not exclude that global trade without usd is growing.

Be it gold, the Petroyuan, swapping resources for oil, ...

Countries don't like the $ anymore and find ways around it.
3482 2018-08-27 16:36:11 Oil egg shell it.
3483 2018-08-27 16:36:11 So maybe Canada should shut off the 40 percent of the oil you use

Olive oil

Crushed red pepper
Oregano
Garlic 

Marinate for 30 minutes and grill/bake. 

Enjoy.
3487 2018-08-27 16:35:37 If it was a geographical share scots would have 80% and England 20%.
You are lying again,,the oil is based on population,which was the ojnly way WM could get its hands on most of it.
Again you are wrong!
Maybe go check for yourself
3488 2018-08-27 16:35:20 How can the government let this type of ox to be legal? There must be something to make this snake oil vendors stop from scam people.

Its ready 
3494 2018-08-27 16:34:51 Thank you, however The North American Olive Oil Association defines the home test as misleading. Almost any oil will solidify at cold temperatures, depending on its chemical compounds factors such as olive variety and time of harvest. We can confirm our oil is authentic. :)
3495 2018-08-27 16:34:50 Even better with rapeseed oil 
3496 2018-08-27 16:34:48 Remainder of olive oil from eggs, any bacon grease/Sausage juice in there, throw some extra butter in, moderate/high heat, when the butter starts to sizzle, bread in, quickly soak the bread, turn over - fry. Press down on the bread with a spatula thing if it's starting to smoke.
3497 2018-08-27 16:34:46 Girl my hair grew like crazy. No heat. If you HAVE to use heat, use moroccan oil & the lowest temp. Use moisturizing masks every shower & whatever shampoo/conditioner had coconut oil in it

3501 2018-08-27 16:34:27 This could be an issue if they start blocking oil tankers. Probably not their best decision. We don’t have Hussein Obama in office, maybe they forgot.

Yep, all those oligarchs & dictators who control the windmill industry .. versus oil wealthty dictators.
Can you name one oil rich dictator, comrade? 

Try picking up a basic history book, before your next set of bs comments.
3511 2018-08-27 16:34:07 As a Canadian, I can’t wait to see what happens to the northern states when most/all trade across the 
Canada/US border stops. And tourism. And we keep our oil. And Nestle has to get their water somewhere else.
We’ll be ok.
3512 2018-08-27 16:33:58 To be fair. I would be completely fine with big oil funding my $tsla short position. Get at me @BP_plc @exxonmobil @Shell @Saudi_Aramco @GazpromEN #BigOilBoys etc...
3513 2018-08-27 16:33:51 ARMY! I think I am addicted to avocado toast! I like it on a good multi grain/seed bread with olive oil, lemon juice and sea salt. What are some of your favorite healthy snacks?

3517 2018-08-27 16:33:23 Coconut oil great for a deep condition leaves hair soft shiny
3518 2018-08-27 16:32:55 I'll expand: oil companies provide oil but also get careless and cause massive disasters that ruin many, many lives. Yet, they're not 'the enemy'; they're just a disinterested corporation. Media is similar; oddly though, media does need things to go badly sometimes to make sales.
3519 2018-08-27 16:32:53 ha! the first rule of coconut oil is that you never talk about coconut oil :-)

3521 2018-08-27 16:32:34 There are 3 types of civilizations, depending on what energy resource they use. Humans are civilization type 0.
We could already be a civilization type 1 if we changed how we gather our energy but bcs there are still a couple people profiting from oil we haven’t done much...
3522 2018-08-27 16:32:32 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
3523 2018-08-27 16:32:20 Ok , part 2 of the failed white paper, page 74 it states that oil and gas receipts would reach £7.9 billion in 2016/17. Did you believe that?
3524 2018-08-27 16:32:16 I've been trying to make myself use it sometimes, but I've been working on the same 12 ounce jar for 3 years now. I'm an olive oil gal. :) But I need SOMETHING solid I can bake with! Now GF/CF. :(

3530 2018-08-27 16:31:51 One way Kenyans can beat the oil cartels is to cycle to work. This will save on fuel consumption and improve their health as well. It will also reduce demand for oil based products forcing dealers to lower their prices.

3539 2018-08-27 16:31:10 You know the @DawnDish commercial where the ducks and otters get a bath because they’re covered in oil? How do I get the job as otter/duck washer? I want it.

This wont happen.
3545 2018-08-27 16:30:23 All I know is what's in the article. It's probably the part of Loving county with all the oil derricks!

Coconut oil is real poison.
3548 2018-08-27 16:30:03 I like what Edmonson is saying, but I guarantee you that the Republicans will use this as a scare tactic that oil and gas will stop drilling and lose jobs.
3549 2018-08-27 16:29:51 Well with Westminster taking 92% of scots oil revenues 
does that not leave 8%?
3550 2018-08-27 16:29:46 Oh my god stop. The whole GDP of Russia doesn’t even surpass New Jersey. They only export oil, majority of which we get from the Middle East. This is a terrible headline.

3559 2018-08-27 16:28:24 My FBI agent is real diligent. Jusso all the adds on my ig related to oil and gas 
3560 2018-08-27 16:28:21 That very well could be. As long term investor, I’d buy there for sure...but, the only way the Saudis and the other formerly private investors can own now Tesla, is to buy the stock. This FUD will self extinguish soon, like an oil well fire blowing itself out.
3561 2018-08-27 16:27:54 That 1.7 Billion dollars was Iran’s money . It was frozen by sanctions but it was their oil assets that were frozen . It was given back because they agreed to stop working on nuclear weapons . Our allies were a part of that deal . So we gave back their money not U S money .

3587 2018-08-27 16:24:19 If it was seen as a curse to all CB's, the ECB never would've put the 15% of reserves that was placed into mkd-to-mkt gold; they'd have put it into USTs instead & forever tied their fortunes to USD (& thereby guaranteed the EU would one day be unable to afford imported oil.)

3590 2018-08-27 16:23:15 Our Governor @GovHolcomb has made CBD oil legal here for those that need it. I'm not positive that Gov Pence would have made this move. I just don't know. Maybe.
3591 2018-08-27 16:23:10 This is one well and as cost are only $20 a barrel and oil is at $75 so it doesn’t take much to make it commercial. The well is paid for 500 bopd is 25k profit a week or 9m a year. Wait til we have 20 wells pumping.
3592 2018-08-27 16:23:02 Oil and coal better for pocket book, Wind not.
3593 2018-08-27 16:22:48 I would start with checking out natural stuff first like Lions Mane, Cordyceps, l-theanine, ginseng, guarana, vinpocitine, B-complex vitamins and DHA\EPA (fish oil).

Not all at once of course lol

Just some stuff to look at and see if the benefits are good for you.
3594 2018-08-27 16:22:37 it’s profitable for military contractors, oil companies, and the media (war=ratings). that benefit doesn’t reach you and I. in fact the opposite, money which could be used for education, infrastructure, tax cuts, etc. is used to bomb people
3595 2018-08-27 16:22:36 I don't belong to anyone.

I just never go to sleep at all,

3601 2018-08-27 16:21:09 In short, It may actually not include Canada, and it likely means more car parts have to be produced in "high wage" factories in Mexico to stay duty free when imported to the US. Also might have implications on Mexico's oil and gas industry opening up to foreign investors
3602 2018-08-27 16:20:58 About to get a oil change in Charger an get the recall done
3603 2018-08-27 16:20:45 Here oil price is hiking... You journalist is simply talking and debating 2002 what happened and 1984 what happened?
3604 2018-08-27 16:20:38 Adulting hits hard when all you want is an oil change and then you need brakes replaced because apparently you have "none", and there will likely be an etc, etc, etc... and my mechanical engineer father is in KY so no family discount. 
3605 2018-08-27 16:20:30 It’s so infuriating and true

3628 2018-08-27 16:18:00 India's energy policy should reflect more natural gas consumption at the expense of lower oil and coal consumption. Currently there is too much emphasis on expensive renewables, resulting into capital allocation with a much lower rate of return.

3631 2018-08-27 16:17:50 ..should be in terms of public technology. The fact that gas, oil & coal (for example) are still relied upon by citizens of the world speaks volumes to where we are at. If the 1% wanted too, they can cure poverty, create a world that doesn’t rely on conflict for prosperity, ..
3632 2018-08-27 16:17:47 Watching The Price is Right while getting an oil change and this quietly enthusiastic woman named Kathy just won a double showcase and damn is it refreshing to see genuine excitement.

3654 2018-08-27 16:16:07 They didn’t help the oil market as companies have left for the US due to all the new regulations. Not to mention the pipelines that were cancelled.
3655 2018-08-27 16:15:54 They said low oil prices was majorly responsible for the slow growth abi recession.

Now oil prices are stable and we are still experiencing downward growth
3656 2018-08-27 16:15:47 I remember the wackadoodles implying that Ft Mac “deserved” devastating fire because of the oil patch.  Do they apply the same thought process to BC?

3658 2018-08-27 16:15:31 All terrific excuses for why Alberta should be able to continue to spew carbon into the air at an extraordinary rate, dooming the planet. Aldyen, your tweets will be remembered as apologising for Big Oil's destruction of this planet. Big Oil thanks you.
3659 2018-08-27 16:15:27 And when negotiations re open with Canada energy on the table. We will take previous agreement on energy off the table as that agreement had us sell u oil far under FMV. Since 1994 imagine how bad this deal was for Canada

China is investing in renewable energy at a rate higher than US & Europe combined.

Take it from this 30yr O&G energy vetran, we must evolve.
3674 2018-08-27 16:14:07 Not sure palm oil is more effiecent, but the tropical rain forest from Africa 2 Asia is being cut & burned to grow palm nut trees putting at risk 100’s of bird & animal species; adding CO2 to the atmosphere; & creating slave like conditions 4 workers. China is largest market
3675 2018-08-27 16:14:07 If you don’t put a shit ron of cheese and ranch dressing on it, yes, salads are mostly healthy. It’s raw vegetables and some vinegar and olive oil. What’s not healthy
3676 2018-08-27 16:14:00 Also... Brennan is marching us to war with Iran & China over the Strait of Hormuz & Iranian oil.
3677 2018-08-27 16:13:59 The West doesn't need foreign oil.

If we can simply break down algae in biodigesters, recycle the exhaust into algae tanks, & make oil via GTS for $25/barrel or *less*...

Then it's a matter of protecting our Mideast allies.

Who really *shouldn't* have backed Russia.
3678 2018-08-27 16:13:54 It created 800,000 american manufacturing jobs alone in its 1st four years.

3683 2018-08-27 16:12:56 Read the article Pierre. It was a mix of rich people offloading income to 2015 and the oil decline. The Liberals didn’t tank the oil market and the income offloading was a one time unavoidable thing that will be corrected when the 2017 stats come out.

3687 2018-08-27 16:12:42 Govt says that Funds coming from unplanned changes in the international prices of crude oil are being treated as funds for planned works.

But only a fool will believe tht works can be planned on the basis of unplanned funds.

3690 2018-08-27 16:12:13 Having various essential oils at home has been a game changer. Burned my hand yesterday and immediately pulled out the lavender oil. Besides slight discoloration, I can’t tell it was burned.
3691 2018-08-27 16:12:03 Brady’s behavior and his being alligned with a snake oil salesman are consonant with that of the dickhead charlatan he supported in the election, so no surprise here.

3702 2018-08-27 16:10:50 So is there any kind of details of this "deal" or is this just another Trump North Korea wordplay from Trump that means nothing?? Snake oil salesman.
3703 2018-08-27 16:10:49 not sure what you’re trying to say here. we’re spending billions to continue bombing/killing. has been happening since WW2. look up manufacturing consent. motivations are economic; country wont bend to our will re opening markets to our corporations or allowing us to control oil

3720 2018-08-27 16:09:05 When you think of all the crappy reasons the US has deployed its troop for lately, this would be a nice change but I don't think it would be profitable.  No oil in South Africa.
3721 2018-08-27 16:09:00 HACCP means Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point, English food needs cooked to a temperature over 75 degrees whereas is Scotland it has to be over 82 degrees and if you spill a fuck ton of oil pour salt on it, the salt soaks up the oil meaning you can clean it up with ease.

3725 2018-08-27 16:08:06 What advantages do you think Ireland has over Scotland? Smaller pop., poorer resources, no oil?

Scotland GDP/ head 2015 £31.6k
UK GDP/head 2015  £31.2k
Ireland GDP/head 2015 £51.1k

Scotland already produces more per head than the UK but we are miles behind IRL. Why?
3726 2018-08-27 16:08:03 Doesn't bode well for agriculture once the oil runs out. Maybe animal emissions not so bad after all? Apart from being eaten animals can be used for draft, can be fed from farms own resources and manure applied as fertiliser/soil conditioner can prevent soil loss. Win win win win

3762 2018-08-27 16:05:28 Def a good idea to take breaks. Check out your tire pressure and prep the car before hand. If its getting close on milage for an oil change i will just change it before the trip. Bringa sleeping bag and water incase you get stuck or just need a break.

3807 2018-08-27 16:00:29 In 10 years they’ll be bankrupt because transportation will be switching rapidly to all electric. EV absorption rates projected to skyrocket after 2025.

3950 2018-08-27 15:44:44 Haha! That only happened once for me so far. It was an old 80 chevy that got cooked and caught the oil on the manifolds on fire! XD
3951 2018-08-27 15:44:43 Today we’ve got grapefruit oil diffusing and lemon lime water to drink! Soaking up the scents of summer while we can! 
3952 2018-08-27 15:44:38 Nothing worse than getting your oil changed and having everyone undermine you on your knowledge about your vehicle.

I know my air filter is dirty but I’ll buy one myself and replace it for a lot less than $40!!!!!!
3953 2018-08-27 15:44:36 I was yes! Post oil change treat + a show with the barista chasing the turkey
3954 2018-08-27 15:44:32 Girl i don’t live and Jamaica so that scenario would never happen. 2, i wouldn’t go sun bathing w/ just some olive oil or coconut oil on me. I don’t live near a beach, i don’t go play in the sun like that. For a casual outing my natural oils have done my skin wonders

3957 2018-08-27 15:44:04 Baloney....there were more gas and oil permits issued under Obama than anyone. Coal is NOT a viable source of power because make us sick.
3958 2018-08-27 15:43:58 Folks got mad at her mom for showing how to wash dishes but if boy doesn’t  know how to change oil or fix a car the first thing y’all will scream is “who raised you” like kids should learn all skills to function in society
3959 2018-08-27 15:43:56 Yes, v similar to @claudiamassie’s Philips map. I wonder if these reflected an official line. During the war the British were keen not to antagonise Ibn Saud and even after hoped to put off the vexed Q of the frontiers till after IS was dead. Oil forced the issue.

If scots are NOT in EU they will ignore our democratic vote untill there is no oil or gas left then we will have indy forced apon us.

3970 2018-08-27 15:42:48 Yes, that wasn’t the point of my tweet though. We have spent what we earned since 2011, our revenue is the 6th highest in the world yet your fans still refer to our money as “oil money”.

Also, repair crews were ordered by the WH to prioritize oil and gas services over hospitals.

4007 2018-08-27 15:38:38 I would say this is a completely delusional statement, but then again, you have to consider the source. It’s a statement made without considering the consequences of it’s actions. How do the Mullahs think the Chinese would react to that flow of oil, gas being cut off?

4044 2018-08-27 15:33:19 maybe the CEO's of big oil companies have direct experience of the Earth's natural beauties but attribute their degradation to something other than their own activity.
4045 2018-08-27 15:33:18 Stop playing games wih these people. America has the ability to be energy self sufficient. Instead of spending billions on military to protect oil company interests in the Mid East we should be spending that money on clean energy technologies.
4046 2018-08-27 15:33:15  can now sell oil directly to foreign markets for a premium price, allowing us to reduce supply & still cover our fixed costs. This allows us to slowly transition away from fossil fuels without bankrupting Canadians. Thank you.

4061 2018-08-27 15:30:48 nope, using 2 bhas for your skin only causes damage. so, i will suggest you to use aha after applying bha. but try to use it as exfoliator. while for toner, find the one which uses alcohol free (eg: cosrx centella)
also for blackhead, you can use jojoba oil.

4072 2018-08-27 15:28:58 ""Transferrable Tax History""

Tories shutting the stable door after the cash has bolted and calling it"'supporting our oil and gas industry".

If you support Scotland hand over 90% of oil and gas revenues to Scotland - where it belongs under international law.

4122 2018-08-27 15:23:22 Look at Venezuela. One of the biggest holes there is. Why? Well let us start with nationalizing the oil fields in the 70s. Nationalizing the oil fields was supposed to help give health insurance for all help the poor. The country went on a downward spiral from there.

4133 2018-08-27 15:22:02 Ummmm, so it's not absolute if you want to protect those who cause the damage......air pollution, plastics and climate change......all link to the oil and gas industry......maybe you should challenge them and the people who consume there products.
4134 2018-08-27 15:22:00 28% of India's imports is Oil, by building mega Solar Power projects India is trying to reduce the biggest chunk of it's imports.

4135 2018-08-27 15:21:53 Ugh my parents do that too. When i went to visit her, my mother wanted to send back a gallon of olive oil and a sack of freshly baked bread to put into my luggage bag. I’m sure airport security and TSA would have been excited to have fresh food that day.
4136 2018-08-27 15:21:37 For sure. I'm from Texas and have family members in the industry. My point is that the study heavily weights amount of hours worked during the week, which would explain why AK (w fishing & oil) could rank first.

4207 2018-08-27 15:13:13 I bought a big bottle of tea tree oil before I left for my vacation and I totally forgot about it. Man I just took a shower and rubbed it all over my body. These mosquito bites are no longer itching ! I’m so happy I have this oil. I only took the really small one out of town.

4210 2018-08-27 15:13:07 Dearth of payment for jobs, lack of mobilization for new jobs....why keep the workers or why employ more...challenges in the oil sector.... working capital debt over hang could be about N30bn at 20% per annum.... work portfolio is not the challenge, are you getting paid?

4216 2018-08-27 15:12:24 I have done nothing but read how other countries were involved in this mess. Our govt did not invite Putin & Russia to hack our elections.That honor goes to trump a presidential nominee at the time
Trump kicking us out of the Iran deal opened things up for Saudi oil

4222 2018-08-27 15:11:49 Yessss! Whoever invented them, is an absolute superstar. Can eat them every day... in a “proper dish”, in a sauce, on toast or fresh bread, or just as a quick snack: cut in half, some rocksalt and coarsely ground pepper and olive oil in the hole... and scoop out those babies...

4230 2018-08-27 15:10:49 Edibles made with oil > edibles made with bud
4231 2018-08-27 15:10:45 If you do CBD oil or edibles yes. There is also a CBD roll on pain stick I use during menstrual cycles and it helps a little.
4232 2018-08-27 15:10:44 yep, someone hates it... also the flow for oil and energy is bullish and higher fuel prices hurt airlines

4234 2018-08-27 15:10:02 so would scots be better off with 100% of oil revenues instead of the 8% we get now,,,well of course they would.
Are scots wrong to want to run thier own country,,you did`nt answer that one.
I did`nt ask if you disagreed with them,you copped out

4237 2018-08-27 15:09:21 Because of the added Vegetable Fat Oil's ,Sugar, Stabilizers and Emulsifiers.

4238 2018-08-27 15:09:17 The cause is Venezuela nationalising oil, gas, electricity, rail etc and sacking all the experts who were all foreigners. The result is that they cannot maintain any of the key industries. When things break they mostly stay broken. This is the result of socialist dogma.

4243 2018-08-27 15:08:13 With all due respect, sir, please take a look in the mirror. And then stop voting to let oil companies destroy our land with no recourse and take our natural resources without sharing our wealth. Stop blaming your constituents and do your job.
4244 2018-08-27 15:07:39 Could Civitas be similar to olive oil?
4245 2018-08-27 15:07:19 Food Prices set to rise by further 5% because of warm weather, screams headline. And like bus fares OR fish & chips, will never come down again, even when there's a glut of oil or potatoes. Add #brexit into this & oh boy, they r going to really rip us off
4246 2018-08-27 15:06:52 When u oil ur hair after two years that too with olive oil just to make up for the last two years and then wash it that’s when u realize how difficult it is to wash oily hair...I’m done oiling my hair for one year atleast.

4260 2018-08-27 15:04:34 The guy on the left killed 133 of his fellow military men. That's CNN oil with you? He also left his wife after she was disfigured in a horrific accident. That's cool with you too?
4261 2018-08-27 15:04:34 It wasn't a threat in 2014. Just a lie perpetuated by WM to keep our oil revenue & a place to keep their nukes. How much more appealing does independence from this mess seem now!
4262 2018-08-27 15:04:31 so, the government taking the industries abd giving them to the people (with no one with the knowledge to actually lead it) is not that? Having a bank card to receive 'the profit of oil sales' is not that? Mmm
4263 2018-08-27 15:04:27 Yes...read socialist text very well, i assume you wont
Its a world economy, every where in the world will be socialist
Wars are started for oil, money, greed and for profit, if we eliminate the need for money and profit, they why war?
4264 2018-08-27 15:04:25 I wasn't blaming one phony party or the other - they're all puppets for the Military Industrial Complex. This is the 3rd Admin under which we're in Afghanistan - it's been 4.5 times as long as WW2! How's THAT not a racket? We should wean off oil & mind our own business.

4274 2018-08-27 15:02:56 So lets me get this straight
scots need bailed out by 13BN PER YEAR
we get this money from those who take 92% of our oil and gas revenues
So rUK would be better off if scots were indy wouldn't they.

4288 2018-08-27 15:01:00 If you already have done that, liver is also key. I use bullet proof coffees to help clean my liver. The mct oil is fat that can only be processed through your liver so it flushes it. I also like to take supplemental herbs that remove toxins and fake hormones.
4289 2018-08-27 15:00:58 The only jobs Democrats know how to create is GOVERNMENT jobs.

Yes they were lavish and correct, but same as any oil rich country.

4469 2018-08-27 14:40:11 CORRECTION:  @realDonaldTrump and @GOP promised they'd end LIFE SAVING regulations on coal and oil, and restore death rates of Americans from pollution. They're delivering today with this action. This means More profit for them, and a return to environmental destruction.

4474 2018-08-27 14:39:53 Iceland have always been decent for vegans.  Nobody seems to catch onto this but I've been shopping there for over 20 years.  Shame about all the plastic.  But they at least are making an effort with some things and are going palm oil free as well.

4484 2018-08-27 14:38:16 Is there anything coconut oil can't do?
4485 2018-08-27 14:38:15 Thinking the economy collapsed suddenly in 2016 baffles me most a lot. The indicators was pointing towards that direction when oil was $115 per barrel in June 2014 and fell to $35 at the end of February 2016. No wonder some states was having difficulties to pay salaries mid 2015.
4486 2018-08-27 14:38:11 If only gas prices and oil prices went sky high, the rich are doing great everyone else it's worse then ever.  Anyone who has to praise himself, is trying hard  to hide the fact, that he sucks.

4520 2018-08-27 14:34:27 Yeah, that's why hundreds of companies were able to give bonuses, black unemployment lowest in history, largest tax reduction in history, restoring the military, oil production sufficient to supply the world, GDP up over 4% reduced regulation allowing new businesses to start.
4521 2018-08-27 14:34:18 Israel prefers the House of Saud being in power.  It has always been about that and oil.  Weapon sales is just another way to get oil money and also gives us more proxy war assets in the Middle East.

4529 2018-08-27 14:32:43 I am such a procrastinator for getting my oil changed. 
4530 2018-08-27 14:32:38 Remember. When the roads are wet and it hasn’t rained in a while, the oil buildup will cause the roads to be slick.

Coconut is widely used in India and elsewhere in all forms. It is a great alkaliser, which protects from cancer.

4582 2018-08-27 14:26:20 i would assume because it went off on its own. have you gotten an oil change lately? low/old oil can be a cause of it coming on.
4583 2018-08-27 14:26:17 Rupee weakened against the US Dollar today, as Dollar index gained strength. Also, Dollar demand by oil importers and for government’s defence related payments weighed the currency down. However, Dollar sales by exporters kept the losses in check.

4601 2018-08-27 14:24:28 最初は前奏、間奏がある 同じBPMの曲を繋ぐのがよいです。同人楽曲は前奏や間奏がない曲が多すぎるので慣れないうちはとても大変です。
私の主催の DJ練習会もまたやりますので遊びに来て下さいー。

4607 2018-08-27 14:23:46 Crude oil and game theory: We predict and act as if the rest of market stake holders would remain static. Many went long on crude  in yr 2015 thinking price would rise when market rose every body went short to book profits and crude prices  further crashed
4608 2018-08-27 14:23:37 do u hav reactions to this unfeasible Yale professor's claim that Coconut Oil, a rare source of Medium Chain Triglycerides among other benefits; is actually "poisonous" to humans?
4609 2018-08-27 14:23:37 Poison the soil. Soak the land with used motor oil. Make it so no crops will grow. 
Poison the water wells.  Boobytrap the house. Let the animals starve.

Cut your losses. Move to a country that appreciates you.
4610 2018-08-27 14:23:34 Oil money from Terengganu, Kelantan, Sabah, Sarawak were the seed money that turned West Coast into what it is today. What do they get in return? Almost nothing.

4612 2018-08-27 14:23:33 CPI has been pushing 3% with a strong #USD and a moderate oil price, can only imagine where this is going after a NAFTA deal gets done and the USD weakens, not to mention a potential spike in the oil price from Iran sanctions. #stagflation #Inflation
4613 2018-08-27 14:23:32 .@realdonaldtrump sent over 100,000 jobs and Canadian oil to China all because he would not approve Keystone XL.
4614 2018-08-27 14:23:30 What sort of waste would there be if each chassis is basically all metal? Used up oil or something?
4615 2018-08-27 14:23:09 Well they are told cannabis oil is what killed J. Smith, and turned people into filthy heathens. You have to think of the children Cuddle!

4627 2018-08-27 14:21:42 I wouldn't dismiss the plastic issue. However, the bigger catch all message should be to consume less "stuff" (i.e. energy, resources including lots of oil). But telling people they can't have things is a hard sell, keeping their conscious clean by refusing a straw less so.
4628 2018-08-27 14:21:42 わーい全部A以上だ〜

4631 2018-08-27 14:21:05 This is true! CBD Oil helps a lot.
4632 2018-08-27 14:21:05 We don't need a wider war.  Pull back from Iraq if we have to and simply blockade Iran till its economy collapses.  Add in air strikes on oil field and terminals as well vital infrastructure as needed.
4633 2018-08-27 14:20:56 1 gram a DAY of fish oil no wonder. I take 8gms a DAY there is a difference in the amount you take to  achieve full benefit. Look at Dr. Barry Sears research.
4634 2018-08-27 14:20:55 just fyi Brian, my s-i-l had enormous brain stem stroke/MI, she's up walkin', driving locally.  She uses full-strength CBD oil during the day and full-strength whole plant cannabis oil at night (w/THC), neurologist is astounded.  google it xoxox i hope the best for you, li'l bro

4637 2018-08-27 14:20:46 McCains role was as diplomatic warmonger, he was tasked with lying, he was so good at it.. There US flags and bases, no one is threatening or attempting to attack the US. The US government is spending trillions not for the benefit of you, unless you have shares in oil and weapons
4638 2018-08-27 14:20:44 Wilson posted a Royal Navy squadron to the Mozambique Channel. This blockade, the Beira Patrol, was endorsed by UN Security Council Resolution 221 ". To try abd stop oil imports

4646 2018-08-27 14:19:55 World's cheapest oil supplies have always loved gold.  World's biggest energy exporter (RU) & importer (CN) are both buying massive qtys of gold.  The world's most expensive oil w/7% mthly decline rates is attempting to back the USD w/that oil.  Only one way this movie can end...
4647 2018-08-27 14:19:34 Prohibitively expensive, no doubt. 1st guy I borrowed a mower from NEVER changed the oil, in roughly 10 years. #idiots

4653 2018-08-27 14:18:49  most of British oil is from Scotland, we rely on them plus Wales and NI for things we can't do. We owe Scoland
4654 2018-08-27 14:18:43 It’s astonishing the amount of US folk who happily fall for these snake oil salesmen. In contrast, been watching some YT clips of them trying it on in SCO towns & being huckled by cops when passers by complained. #proud

4659 2018-08-27 14:18:11 And the U.S. was reviled as the filthy conquers for developing their oil and other industries.
4660 2018-08-27 14:18:01 Me too, and ironically, a beard oil/balm co.
4661 2018-08-27 14:17:53 Clinical trial shows that fish oil has no positive impact on prevention of cardiovascular risk (n= 15,480)
4662 2018-08-27 14:17:39 Drive freeway or same speeds if possible with the radio off to check for wheel vibrations, suspension noise, how the trans shifts, and engine noise. If possible pop the hood and check fluids like engine oil, coolant, brake fluid, trans fluid, and cleanliness of the engine bay.
4663 2018-08-27 14:17:38 Better our bastads than their bastards I guess.
Here is an idea, get off oil, and let them hash it out amongst themselves.
4664 2018-08-27 14:17:22 CBD oil tastes like pot smells.
4665 2018-08-27 14:17:13 Same thing happened in Angola. When the Portuguese left the country stepped back 300 years and into anarchy. No one knew how to run anything. Shades of Venezuela oil industry.

4667 2018-08-27 14:17:01 If my stoner friends haven’t fucked with Rick Simpson Oil (RSO) yet, I suggest you do. Been helping immensely with my migraines and anxiety
4668 2018-08-27 14:16:59 Wilson has tried to end UDI through economic sanctions, banning the supply of oil to Rhodesia and the import of most Rhodesian goods to Britain. But we are still getting oil from south Africa and Portuguese Mozambique.
4669 2018-08-27 14:16:56 Good morning, it's too early to hear about why oil is the life blood of America.
4670 2018-08-27 14:16:53 We r fighting to be the exception. M7 has kept the oil companies at bay for over 13 years yet most countries begin exporting within the first 4 years after the oil is discovered. It has gotten to a point where Ugandans(but not whites) have forgotten abt our precious lifeline.
4671 2018-08-27 14:16:49 Good to know. Then after I finish the bottle of the liquid Nutra-Vege Omega-3 Plant based Algal Oil that I started about a week ago, I can remove it from the list of supplements that I currently take.
4672 2018-08-27 14:16:43 Estuvo subiendo el oil.  Hasta que la Wma de 30 semanas no este ascendente no entraria estimado.

4678 2018-08-27 14:16:17 I just knocked over a lidless bottle cooking oil that took a tumble down some linoleum-covered stairs.

"Slippery slope" ain't a stinkin' metaphor this morning.

4687 2018-08-27 14:15:17 Unfortunately oil is never going away. Big banks will start wars over that. They will do ANYTHING to keep oil going so really there’s nothing he can do about oil.

4691 2018-08-27 14:14:56 I'd say you objectively strengthen your currency by backing it with energy (which is what US is up to with oil IMHO) or with land, and subjectively strengthen it with gold or (say) Bitcoin
4692 2018-08-27 14:14:44 Privatisation. 
Pension reforms.
Coordinated economic team.
High oil prices.

Biggest enabler for me was telecoms growth. It accelerated economic activity beyond what data can capture.
4693 2018-08-27 14:14:37 But also there are no "deep South" states that don't have oil. The Bible Belt may be the most solidly "red" area of the country, and none of those states make the top 20.

4713 2018-08-27 14:13:06 When did I call them my "enemy"? They're not enemy or friend, but just another collection of corporations. Their case is special in that, like the oil industry, they have the only access to a critical resource: less so now that the internet exists, but still a majority control.

4729 2018-08-27 14:11:05 These fake prophets are a danger to congregations. The people forget to hear God for themselves and believe everything these posers say. Very dangerous and sad. “Deep State” was coined by Alex Jones and metastasized by FOX News.  A snake oil salesmen and a Trump State TV. . .Sad

4745 2018-08-27 14:10:05 A lot to do today, oil change and then laundry along with some organizing.

4759 2018-08-27 14:08:56 When you realize that the local pharmacist sold you homeopathic snake oil instead of anything with pseudoephedrine for your head-cold.
4760 2018-08-27 14:08:35 #PresidentTrump 
If we are the top oil provider in the world how come our gas is so high priced right now. I am a student and my gas to fill up my tank takes up a quarter of my paycheck.
4761 2018-08-27 14:08:35 No oil on Florida beaches. All media hype! Really?? Did you even bother to look yourself? Another bought politician....and you dare to invoke John McCain? You are shameless.
4762 2018-08-27 14:08:27 Wow he’s in Colorado... has he tried full extract oil?
4763 2018-08-27 14:08:22 Euro area has seriously negative oil/gas trade balance & energy insecurity.

4766 2018-08-27 14:08:13 @raj_lala_evolve @EvolveETFs would love a solar/wind power themed ETF! I think other millennials will agree- oil is not sustainable.

4768 2018-08-27 14:07:38 Work seems think I love being there 24/7 so I have to plan the rest of my life in the wee hours I get to myself. Guess who’s using those wee hours to get a wild oil change?  #Wildchild

There were two issues 
1. Sprinkle of engine oil and fumes coming out of dip stick
2.Pick up issue

For problem 1 he told that it is normal and we don't have any resolution for that , I want to confirm that from Tata Motors

4773 2018-08-27 14:06:49 Legal Metrology Dept is making arrangements to ensure quality & quantity checking of petrol and  diesel at petrol bunks to be more transparent with introduction of new five litres standard glass jar allowing consumers and others to have clear view of the oil.
4774 2018-08-27 14:06:43 An entire freighter carrying the same kind of fertilizer you use to make backyard bombs exploded in the ship channel and ignited all the adjoining oil refineries. You could feel it in Louisiana.
4775 2018-08-27 14:06:25 Fair enough
4776 2018-08-27 14:06:13 Never forget @elonmusk @Tesla‘s goal from day one: drive down battery price, kill ICE.  EV will kill legacy automaker and big oil jobs.   FOLLOW THE MONEY!  No $ Saudi dead.

4778 2018-08-27 14:06:00 There can't be any positive growth in the oil sector if we can't build more Refineries.

Let's build SIX additional Refineries - one per geopolitical region.

It will create employment opportunities.

It will bring down local prices of petroleum products.

It's not too late.
4779 2018-08-27 14:05:58 You cause the grass to grow for the livestock and plants for man to cultivate, that he may bring forth food from the earth and wine to gladden the heart of man, oil to make his face shine and bread to strengthen man's heart.

4782 2018-08-27 14:05:47 @writerssss that’s extremely bullish news. Cements the trend towards the electrification of car and truck transport.  Bearish for oil.
4783 2018-08-27 14:05:29 Enjoyed the Man City All or Nothing but its such a sanitised view of Premier League football. Very little insight shown, glossing over anything really negative (especially the dirty oil money) & bigging up their youth team because they gave Foden a few minutes.

4785 2018-08-27 14:05:03 The harvard professor has got his/her facts wrong. People have been consuming coconut oil for ages, way before the professor was born. 
In fact Western countries are already consuming coconut oil, for cooking and even direct consumption.
4786 2018-08-27 14:04:58 Mixed in with the smell of damp, gearbox and engine oil!
4787 2018-08-27 14:04:53 Yaar tumhe sharm aati hai ke nahi. 128 dollar per barrel jab crude oil tha tab bhi congress ne 80 touch nahi hone diya tha aur aaj 63 dollar per barrel hai. To swaal modi se puchho na. Kitna bada digala hai tymhara modi.

4795 2018-08-27 14:03:53  They just poured half of it and the other half they put fresh oil on. 
I’ve heard they will be tearing it up to look like Monroe.

4811 2018-08-27 14:02:25 I am glad to read from the Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, that his state made 150 billion Naira from rice sales last year. This is proof that True Federalism is possible and workable. We do not all have to depend on oil for survival. Other states should learn from Kebbi.
4812 2018-08-27 14:02:04 大丈夫なん？
4813 2018-08-27 14:02:03 Positive direction would be to increase minimum wage to a living wage ($15+/hr) and supplement clean energy jobs, not oil!
4814 2018-08-27 14:01:58 It's a National Review link. You used to work in the oil patch, but see disaster elsewhere to not feel guilty.
4815 2018-08-27 14:01:53 ...
-Increased border security to minimise Illegal immigration also helps the lower income Americans find jobs. 
-Approved the Oil pipeline, More jobs
- Ended the war on coal creating more jobs.
- Leveling the playing field for steel and aluminum with tarrifs, more jobs ...

4845 2018-08-27 13:58:44 Alex Guerrero is a snake oil salesman and should be openly mocked and derided... however he's brainwashed Brady and I'd like to see him hang one more banner before it's all over, so maybe we let him have his placebo effect and stop asking about it? Kthx Boston media.

4859 2018-08-27 13:57:34 Everything I read said not to touch peppermint oil during the first trimester.  It is unknown if it is safe or harmful.
4860 2018-08-27 13:57:34 Same here...Eastern European heritage means I tan no matter how strong the sun block is. Way back when, we used baby oil. I can't imagine that today!

4868 2018-08-27 13:56:39 Wash twice a week. Use a good conditioner. 
Apply oil the night before your hairbath day. Massage scalp with oil in fingertips or using cotton. Place towel on pillow and sleep. Use neem oil if your hair is prone to dandruff. Smells bad but gets rid of dandruff.

4890 2018-08-27 13:53:18 IDK you, just responded to one of your other tweets I saw and checked out your page, then saw this. Lost my mom last year, but while she was sick, I gave her oil and it was the ONLY thing that helped her feel semi normal and not suffer. SO DO IT! I hope your mom gets better too.
4891 2018-08-27 13:53:14 You can always contact the niggas who drive to you personally and change your oil. They’re good!
4892 2018-08-27 13:52:57 Pssst.  They aren't called fossil fuels anymore.  The idea coal and oil came from a pile of rotting plants and dinosaurs 400 miles high in old, fake news.

4898 2018-08-27 13:52:04 Russia itself shows signs of abating these days, feeling the twin pains of lower oil prices and corruption. Trump is spot-on about Merkel and her pipeline. The long-game here is to make Putin feel the economic pain. Calling Ronald Reagan.

4901 2018-08-27 13:51:38 Ok, so we have to get voters, Congress & the Prez to agree to spend billions on renewables that can meet our energy needs w/ no negative side effects. We have to get the Right to agree to destroy the oil, coal & gas industries & the Left to embrace nuclear. Do I have that right?
4902 2018-08-27 13:51:37 And the dip was attributed to the reduction in oil GDP which has been on a constant decline worldwide. It's also important to note that for the first time since Nigeria’s exit from recession, growth was driven by the non-oil sector, which grew by 2.05 per cent,

4925 2018-08-27 13:48:25 With support they will not need fossil fuels and neither will the developed nations.

5039 2018-08-27 13:33:50 No it wasn't.
First Westminster hid scots oil then lied about the amount,then decided that keeping 92% of it was fair,,leaving scots with 8% of their own oil.
I hope your not suggesting scots are subsidised Clive?
If you are I will ask you about that 92%
England is subsidised

5051 2018-08-27 13:32:06 I started with chicken and turkey.  Slow cooked in olive and coconut oil.  Then ground it up (keep the oil) in a food processor (I have one of those heavy duty blenders).  Freeze in ice trays, each cube is a serving.  Then, did same w/ boiled vegetables & fruit (in just water)
5052 2018-08-27 13:32:04 That would be the case if the Euro were redeemable for gold. As it is, the gold is as much use as oil is to Venezuela's Petro.

5054 2018-08-27 13:31:48 @AValiavska An example of pathos in organizational rhetoric is the Dawn dish soap campaign with the duck on the bottle showing that if you buy their soap more animals will be saved from pollutions like oil. #OrgAd3 #COMM3460

GDP Growth slowed. Services had fastest growth rate since Q4 2015. Trade contracted. Industries, Agriculture & Manufacturing grew slightly but not as much as Q1 2018 rate. Oil refining GDP & Crude under mining & quarrying contracts.

5299 2018-08-27 12:59:23 Pure veg (no milk and no deep fried items) food make us prettier. It removes oil from our face in an organic manner. That is boiled rice,cereals,wheat bread instead of deep fried and oil administered Food items. I am a non vegetarian. I tested this and found to be true.

5301 2018-08-27 12:59:17 Also oil could feed into an ever growing petrol chemicals industry, cars will decline but other areas will grow. Seen a story of air travel being changed from oil will take time but air travel growth is crazy strong even with more fuel efficient aircrafts demand is strong

5305 2018-08-27 12:59:03 I agree. It's an obsession to destroy nature. I don't understand why. Here in the states they ran an oil pipeline near Standing Rock, razed nature preserves for malls. Did you hear about Bosworth field where #RichardIII died? They want to convert it into a car test track. 
5306 2018-08-27 12:58:52 "whenever a country tries to sell oil in another currency, the US acts and give an end to its leader either by war or by covert operations."

True in the past, no longer applicable as the Eurodollar supersedes the Petrodollar in importance.

5309 2018-08-27 12:58:36 Those are all nasty but over the long term neither oil spills nor tar sands have been as devastating to wildlife or GHG
I'm not knocking current turf cutters or saying what anyone should do but it is a far worse fuel regardless
5310 2018-08-27 12:58:33 It wasn't about oil. It was about him refusing to use the US dollar for backing his currency and switching to a gold standard. The Rothchild's & Vanderbilt's etc of the Federal Reserve would've lost millions. Yes it was about greed but, not oil greed

5316 2018-08-27 12:57:47 Time for the US to up our oil production and put these suicidal Killers out of business.
5317 2018-08-27 12:57:37 It’s an inflationary crisis driven by an over dependence on oil and a failure to diversify the economy.
5318 2018-08-27 12:57:37 How many petroleum engineering graduates...don't have jobs and yet we have oil in the country.... Oil is not going to solve any of these problems.
5319 2018-08-27 12:57:33 This would only be true if homeopathy actually cured anything at all. It does not. It is 200-year old snake oil. It is a lie and a fraud and can delay sick people from real useful treatments, increasing costs for everyone concerned.

5322 2018-08-27 12:57:24 Not a lot of oil power stations anymore, either  coal, gas and nuclear.
5323 2018-08-27 12:57:21 Forget the token outrage. Support privatization of oil companies-- the only decent solution to the problem.
5324 2018-08-27 12:57:19 Lol.. You mean money that's never been released? 
Aunty, there's no money! We are a broke ass country! Opelope Chinese loans for infrasticture.. 
Our earning from oil in three years is $94B, GEJ earned $400B in four years and did not do this. 
Appreciate.

But it was partly timing...  he came along when a lot of people were so disenfranchised and fed up with the same ol' - same ol'.. he  talked about how he would 'shake things up.' ...and many bought the snake oil. Funny. Hitler had that timing also..

Would those ties include the proposed Qatar oil pipeline?

Isn’t that Qatar oil,pipeline a main factors in  Bapenghazi mess—to send in CIA weapons in Libya (by Hillary) to Syria to aid rebels-to open Syria to Turkish  ports?
5331 2018-08-27 12:56:26 so I got this tea tree oil facial scrub/mask/wash thing in my right eye in the morning and it hurt like a lot. like my eye was menthol.  it’s night now and I just wiped my eye and saw that the granules found the thing we’re still IN MY EYE

Kid’s eating without noticing. I’m no @GordonRamsay but problem solved. #feelingresourceful #parenting
5346 2018-08-27 12:54:51 The US economy doesn't collapse because any leader who advocates selling oil in anything other than the petrodollar gets 'removed' or assassinated.
The US economy is up shit creak. Fiat dollar & $20trillion in debt. It only survives due to the Petrodollar giving confidence.

5350 2018-08-27 12:54:34 Great thing about being in the oil fields is that when we’re down and home. We still get out hours every week for just being home
5351 2018-08-27 12:54:32 Use anointing oil
5352 2018-08-27 12:54:24 High oil prices helps the world’s biggest refiner by capacity, known as Sinopec, proposed an interim dividend of 0.16 yuan a share, a 60 percent YoY increase.Better PAT recorded since 2000.High demand along with Iran sanctions will drive Oil upwards.
5353 2018-08-27 12:54:10 For me shale is not the way forward for anyone. Is just a patch for failing companies into conventional oil. Like that anglo iranian company.... (let me avoid the name, just in case. But you understood already....)
5354 2018-08-27 12:53:47 I need to stop using groundnut oil to make stew,this pimples invasion is getting too much
5355 2018-08-27 12:53:37 Today oil is main thing to consider which people should live, enjoy life. It is useless to dig land to know whether holy or not. People in the past are in texts. Research them or search oil. Don't fool the world with religion, race etc. Come on WTO in open.
5356 2018-08-27 12:53:09 Yup. I'm doing two tablespoons of Ghee butter with 1 tablespoon of organic coconut oil...
5357 2018-08-27 12:52:49 Libya was France's deal. Gaddafi cut off their oil. 20% of their energy was from Libya. The EU would suffer along with France; so they all agreed to send in terrorists to smash up the place. After it got really bad, the Western military showed up to pelt them all with missiles.
5358 2018-08-27 12:52:41 My son had rash all over his body and the nurse told me to wash him with water and glycerine soap then apply sweet oil and i washed him 2times and the rash was gone

5360 2018-08-27 12:52:10 Haha! You have to strip your natural colour first for this to take. At least lighten it (with bleach).
It can be a damaging process as you well know so, you'd prolly have to leave a few days between stages (and deep condition, steam, hot oil too.)
Buuut, your colour is gorgeous!
5361 2018-08-27 12:51:59 Let me always help out to convince you, a man who government mange to pay our foreign debt despite crude oil was selling at $11 per barrel, and this man was incharge of the economy team
5362 2018-08-27 12:51:56 Watching the today show and they're cooking salmon and they put like a tiny ass sprinkle of salt on some salmon then put it in a pot FULL of OIL. They said "generous amount of seasoning".  #whitepeopleatitagain
5363 2018-08-27 12:51:22 #qanda Christensen had problems with Wilmar Sugar. Wilmar is partner of Adani destroying Orangutan habitat, polluting, in Indonesia for Palm Oil. Wilmar is environmental nightmare like Adani.
5364 2018-08-27 12:51:16 I won't lie: harvesting corpses before burying them for body fat, press it for oil and use the oil with grinded bone to obtain white paint in order to produce white candles (hemp rope + beeswax + white paint) to enhance the sunday sermon is pretty awesome :-D #GraveyardKeeper
5365 2018-08-27 12:51:13 I wonder what extra problem they gone diagnose when I go get my oil change.
5366 2018-08-27 12:51:07 I speak from experience nobody is allowed to work for oil operating companies (not service) unless they are supported by a specific party

5373 2018-08-27 12:50:23 It does indeed! One variety I know is rice-based and the other is made of coconut oil. It melts really nicely on pizza
5374 2018-08-27 12:50:08 also using olive oil helps but I don't always

5380 2018-08-27 12:49:03 That’s correct. 

Zero @HouseDemocrats @dscc democratic congressman put the benefit of the most elite billionaires and millionaires and corporate CEO and Oil magnets and coal producers FIRST.

5385 2018-08-27 12:48:20 No...  But there's data from NBS showing that GDP growth has slowed down for the second consecutive quarter despite increased oil prices.

Also they're big centrally located players, & way back when there was a romantic-arab/dirty-jew mindset (in a totally not homoromantic misogynist way) among the fp elites.

Prob also sunk cost, & I would be completely unsurprised if some sort of blackmail showed up.

5391 2018-08-27 12:47:15 The only reason we're seeing the end to globalism is because we're running out of resources. No we don't just run out of oil or minerals they simply get much more expensive. We must begin conserving resources . See Gail Tverberg for why this is so. We can't afford globalism.
5392 2018-08-27 12:46:54 Yep. Oil fields, mines. Places like that where cabling isn’t possible. Works well if you know what you’re doing.

5396 2018-08-27 12:46:33 And the worst part? "Big polluters" will be exempt. It will be the people who will pay - and suffer. We already have in Ontario people choosing between electricity and food.

5409 2018-08-27 12:45:34 Their only going after Donald Trump because he could expose their treachery. Venezuela is a oil rich country, the people are starving because the Muslim and Russia's taking advantage of the leadership's greed to control the oil. We top the list of countries to take over, destroy.

5413 2018-08-27 12:45:04 Selling snake oil on Iran. Just like Iraq was supposed to roll over to Nirvana and democracy within months of illegal American occupation.

5420 2018-08-27 12:44:08 Research focus for today is thinking about student probabilities around acceptance, attendance, and retention. With all the associated modeling and unknown distributions. Then moving into some oil, opioids, and social infrastructure stresses.
5421 2018-08-27 12:44:05 We're at 68.77 in #cl_f. From here to $69 flat long is a good looking oil trade IMO. 10 tick stop. I'm already in myself.

5428 2018-08-27 12:43:14 どうぞ〜！
5429 2018-08-27 12:42:54 I’m not defending traditional oil extraction. In fact I would like to see it phased out in favour of renewables that convert electricity more efficiently and create many more and better jobs.

5433 2018-08-27 12:41:49 Anyone want to let me run there wing car Friday at gas city ? The 00 wing car has the motor out bc of metal in the oil filter.
5434 2018-08-27 12:41:42 Yeah that’s true! It is a symptom of elitism.

5439 2018-08-27 12:40:33 Yes! I know how cartels work! Yes, it's not very nice! But Venezuela founded OPEC, it benefited for years from $100 oil as a result of OPEC policies, the government KNEW those prices wouldn't last but instead of taking sensible measures the Chavistas enriched themselves
5440 2018-08-27 12:40:32 @tedcruz what do you get when you cross an albino Mexican with 13 pounds of rancid cod oil, and all the bad intentions of an otherwise peaceful nation?

5441 2018-08-27 12:40:24 Bit harsh. I can honestly say I spent a very enjoyable Saturday carving an oil barrel-sized lump of soap (courtesy of Gweled) on Aber sea front, some time in the early mid-90s...

5447 2018-08-27 12:39:57 Fringe interests with money?

The Greens represent what the Dems used to be in the 70's & what the Dems rehtoric is now.

5451 2018-08-27 12:39:28 Made myself a cup of bulletproof coffee this morning. It's not to bad. I added a little to much coconut oil. But hey. I could drink this.

5476 2018-08-27 12:36:14 LMFAO. ISIS has been pushed west away from those oil fields for months. ISIS themselves have said they'd much rather face the regime, in their words "Russian airplanes don't scare us"
5477 2018-08-27 12:35:51 We're not reliant on England! When times are good - especially when the global oil price is high - we more than pay our way. And when times are hard - like now - the UK family supports us. Nationalism is just tribalism by another name. That's why most Scots reject it.

A few companies have started making ‘adapters’ that will let you make a ‘suppressor’ out of fuel, & oil filters. The adapter costs about $50, but, requires a $200 tax stamp

5514 2018-08-27 12:31:53 In 2014 those Oil States commercially raped Venezuela. You refuse to even acknowledge the willfull and evil conscious decision to sell below cost for a sustained period to try to cripple other States.

5525 2018-08-27 12:30:41 Cause and effect dont work so cleanly. Political & $ support for controversial ideas operate differently. I agree that lawyers aren’t in the pocket of trial lawyers they ARE trial lawyers. Bush wasn’t owned by oil men, he was an oil man. But ideological support is different.
5526 2018-08-27 12:30:40 ... And yes to warmongering hawkish attitude, a neocon policy of trading our men and women for oil and profit, of choosing 'Bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb Iran" over diplomacy, even if hard nosed? No thanks, shove it.

5548 2018-08-27 12:27:55 Venezuela is not 19th century Africa. The country has excellent economists, lawyers and politicians of all political stripes. It's an authoritarian state, it hates competence more than anything. Maduro would fail GCSE Economics. The people behind him get rich on oil and gold.
5549 2018-08-27 12:27:34 Or there are alternative supplies at the moment which there are , a lot of oil is being found in shallow waters. Look at the find by Exxon in South America, and tullow in Kenya, Uganda and Ghana

5551 2018-08-27 12:26:58 It's about more than oil. It's about self-determination. No other country in the world is run by its neighbour.

5554 2018-08-27 12:26:47 It’s very convenient to indict a political/economic theory because of one country’s failure. Venezuela is struggling because of the oil crash in 2014-15. Because it has so much oil it never bothered to produce much else.
5555 2018-08-27 12:26:42 The west has got it's fingerprints all over the middle east and it doesn't care about the people as long as the leaders r sympathetic to the western oil interests and if not they'll do their best to put someone in who is, Iran is the current bogey man #justsaying

5571 2018-08-27 12:24:00 You’re joking. Look at what the liberals did to strengthen Canada’s economy and what Harper inherited and immediately began disassembling to support his oil buddies. Canada weathered 07-08 better than most because of the liberal government policies, not Harper’s.

5603 2018-08-27 12:19:01 Morneau is right about the drop being related to the prepayment of tax. Especially in Alberta where there was a 2016 provincial rate increase too. We did a lot of that for our clients. And yeah, drop in oil price meant drop in income for many.
5604 2018-08-27 12:19:01 The report mentioned a growth in NON-OIL GDP from 0.76% in Q1 2018 & 0.45% in Q2 2018 to 2.05% in Q2 of 2018. The contraction seems to be mainly due to decrease in oil GDP in Q2 2017. Diversification is happening albeit slowly.

5647 2018-08-27 12:14:56 That's a false argument.

5727 2018-08-27 12:03:35 This article was written 2 months ago, before Karin Michels put out her study with claims that coconut oil was “poison.” I’m pretty comfortable with the (almost incidental foot)note here + thousands of years of Indians NOT dying from this “poison.” @praanamd great read

5732 2018-08-27 12:03:22 1/2 In my view ECB launched QE (early as I recall) in March 2015 to base € on oil. Once Saudi realised in 2014 Obama had legged them over, ECB printed € to swap for Saudi $ oil proceeds so Saudi could buy Euro debt (probably Bunds & almost certainly collateralised with gold)
5733 2018-08-27 12:03:21 I will add that I didn’t like the feel of beard oil at first. When I tried other brands though, that greasy feel was not there. It may be the balm just didn’t get along with your bread. Not say you need to use beard balm, but it is a thought

5741 2018-08-27 12:02:01 Once an investor realizes that the worst fear of the Federal Reserve is a real economic recovery he can understand their HFT war on commodities which is a war on miners, farmers, oil producers, investors, & small business. The rigging of mkts is to offset risk in their bond book.
5742 2018-08-27 12:01:58 OK, let's put it that growth is slowing down & the economy has contracted for 2 qtrs consecutively.  The good news however is that non-oil sector grew at 2.05% which should be heartwarming. Hopefully in Q3, oil sector will pick up.

The potential of the Weald being the largest onshore oil  play is what is exciting investors and will continue to
5855 2018-08-27 11:46:50 Bolivar was pegged to the dollar until recently - oil being bought and sold in $ . Hyperinflation not an issue if you are U.K. and not pegged / debt in foreign currency. Only happens in extremis : war, debt in foreign money- not in functioning govt with own currency
5856 2018-08-27 11:46:46 Now you know why Petrol is selling at Rs 80 per liter and Diesel at Rs 70. Meanwhile india supplies oil to Nepal and Bhutan much cheaper. Reverse robin hood is happening here

5873 2018-08-27 11:43:47 How much of economic diversifications did you do in your 8yrs as VP, and subsequent PDP regimes? Food production was on paper. Essentially we were selling oil and importing everything. How did that increase employment?

That's not misguided or incompetent. It's evil.

6013 2018-08-27 11:27:11 Not a compliment to have your credentials questioned, based on your appearance. It's not playful nor fun. Being at work isn't an Oil of Olay commercial spot for an academic.

6147 2018-08-27 11:08:15 Monday starter well! I reheated on a microwave a slice of pizza at work as breakfast and two drops of oil dropped on my jeans pants... going to be walking all day long at work with two oil drops on my pants...
6148 2018-08-27 11:08:15 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
6149 2018-08-27 11:08:13 Virgin Coconut oil is better, Dylan!
6150 2018-08-27 11:08:03 I would change the oil in my car myself, but I'd never do the breaks.
I feel like any error in that is a lot more dangerous to me than the oil.
6151 2018-08-27 11:07:53 Yes. Scott has two positions - one running for office and another when in office like a snake oil salesman. Only certainty is personal profit like his buddy in the Whitehouse.

6154 2018-08-27 11:07:23 A wicked wife does not have to kill a husband with gun,knife or outright poison. It is as easy as ABC. All she just do is continue to add excess salt, too much oil in his food and in 5 to 10 years, he will develop high blood pressure and consequent heart attack. Husbands be wise!

6158 2018-08-27 11:06:46 And it doesn’t change the fact that what you know about Islam comes second or third hand from two bit snake oil peddlers masquerading as intellectuals

6160 2018-08-27 11:06:43 Have you (Indian oil corp @IndianOilcl) taken shareholder's approval to display PM Modi's pics at every Indian oil pump station? What is the cost of such ads and benefits to the company? #corporategovernance

6164 2018-08-27 11:05:56 They freak out more with this move to be more democratic than they do to Tom opening up donations from Big Oil as the Climate Crisis looms over us and Trump deregulates everything he can.

6176 2018-08-27 11:02:52 As of now, no alternative on the horizon.

It was reported that the US might regain that role, highlighting the boom of Shale oil. Other experts pushed back against that finding, since the role of swing producer is “market stability” while Shale lead to market instability.

6206 2018-08-27 10:59:23 BullSugar's funneling of voters to their party on their website to view an "endorsed" R candidate with an F voting record who takes Oil money, means they are reinforcing the same behaviors that led to our current disaster. @wgcu #Irresponsible #FLWaterCrisis @ndn @FloridaWeekly

6210 2018-08-27 10:58:27 I recommend high EPA oil to depressed vegans, folks who never eat any fish, and women who’ve just had babies (stress it more for women who’ve had several children within a few years), as high EPA oil may have some utility for depression. DHA or DHA>EPA doesn’t work.

6227 2018-08-27 10:55:23 At the heart of the current policy is the impression that cheap and plenty commodities are available. However, the shale oil and gas narrative shows deep cracks, invisible to the majority of investors and many will be surprised. This is an huge opportunity.

6289 2018-08-27 10:45:09 @realDonaldTrump Not 700,000 barrels, not 1 million barrels, not 2 million barrels, but 2.5 million barrels of oil should be completely cut off by November 4. There are no exemptions in the oil and bank sanctions and all sanctions will be fully implemented.

6293 2018-08-27 10:43:52 The key to a healthy digestive system is only shopping on the outside of the isles at the grocery store. Only eating real food; veggies, beef, seafood, chicken, pork, and dairy. Also stick to olive oil and butter. Stay away from veg oil (that shit will kill you)

Im not gonna show you my face since it looks like ive been swimming in burning oil. My  arm arent that disgusting so its fine.
6311 2018-08-27 10:39:38 Nigeria was always doomed for economic crisis when we relied so much on oil money. Sanusi called it during his time in CBN. Buhari's only fault was having no significant approach to manage it. Nigerians too are part of the problem for not valuing home mades. #ThisIsNigeria

6347 2018-08-27 10:34:50 It is certainly nonsense in most cases. But as people like @bengoldacre have pointed out, sometimes the healthcare industry actually behaves like - an industry. In nutrition, too - and that causes much of the confusion that then provides the soil upon which snake oil sales grow.
6348 2018-08-27 10:34:39 And what does $11 Billion in subsidies, soon to be increased to $13 Billion annually to the coal and oil industries tell you about government intervention?

6378 2018-08-27 10:26:18 Maybe kick them off the human rights council to start with. Develop domestic oil production to reduce their influence. Public condemnations. Sanctions.

This behavior lasts as long as the world tolerates it. Which is what you are doing.

6503 2018-08-27 10:02:38 You sold so much oil in 16yrs made so much money out if it and could not build refinery or even repair the ones others built and you think with low incomes in 3yrs you will stop fuel importation? The good news is that all that will stop before this govt finishes their 8yrs
6504 2018-08-27 10:02:37 this is quite irrelevant for the valuation of @Saudi_Aramco simply because every oil company in the world has a "limited" right on the resources. On the countrary this news shows that KSA is moving into the modernization on the oil law. That is quite positive.

6512 2018-08-27 10:01:38 It's just economics, supply and demand, and oil production fits the basic models better than just about anything else. More production = lower prices for all the downstream products. Even an artificial surplus or shortage still has effect on the market. (eg Enron & electricity $)

6689 2018-08-27 09:25:48 Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany; a few examples to counter your Venezuela argument. Venezuela is a country dependant on oil prices. When the price falls, their economy suffers. On top of that the most powerful country in the world(US) is waging economic war against them

6691 2018-08-27 09:25:37 When it impacts sales, taxes will also fall.

Same way that the snp have been rallying for lower taxes for oil industry. There’s a tipping point where higher taxes damage positive resultsz

6707 2018-08-27 09:22:34 And the recoverable amount is sub 20% at very best? Break even @ $45, cost of further drills to access #Oil? Now let's consider the market cap again? Compare that cap to it's peers, what production rates they actually have.

6710 2018-08-27 09:22:14 A lot of countries have reduced the use of petrol and diesel as fuels and so the crude oil prices are going down but here it's increasing. Maybe the tax,but the tax is nearly double the actual price! Where are all there tax funds going Maybe to BJP party funds.

6724 2018-08-27 09:20:02 To be fair, the only black Fireman I have seen took all his clothes off in front of me, covered himself in baby oil and did the 'helicopter' swing. Not a flame in sight. Baby oil is a nightmare to wash out.

6727 2018-08-27 09:19:32 Ok. Venezuela owes $130 billion to China/US. They can’t print dollars. Oil is their only industry: the price collapsed. Add in they lost tax base, drought ( their energy is all hydro), decline in oil demand, net importer, black market, corruption , etc and it’s not good.

6952 2018-08-27 08:29:01 can’t believe I’ve been sleeping on oil painting ? 

should I experiment w it ? Because Acrylic paint has already grown on me  but I heard it’s easy to master oils once you already know how to work acrylic paints.
6953 2018-08-27 08:28:56 GDP growth 1.5% for Q2 2018, a drop from 1.95% in Q1. This is not good. One would have thought that low inflation and relatively higher oil prices would have given us a push.

Meanwhile Oil GDP contracted by over 3%. This is what we are building our economy upon.
6954 2018-08-27 08:28:33 i honestly don't know why i chose to do oil painting over acrylic.. who am i?? why do i hate myself so much??

6961 2018-08-27 08:26:30 kind of hoping someone will play devil's advocate for the stoves here: 
- they're hopefully displacing some gas or oil (environmentally destructive to harvest; gas pipes leak CH4; gas/oil combustion health risks too)
- chimneys typically higher than lorry exhausts?
- time of use?

7084 2018-08-27 08:03:07 According to @WorldBank the logistics performance in Kenya has gone down from rank 42 in 2016 to 68/160 in 2018. 

With increased prices and imposition of 16% VAT on oil, we could see the transport performance deteriorate sharply and the economy will have to struggle to move up.

7105 2018-08-27 07:59:26 Sublingual, it’s a fractionated coconut oil infusion. Those two bottles could last two months if taken 1ml 4x daily which is honestly quite a high dosage. There are other products such as CBD isolate crystals that may be smokable, or possibly able to be added to ejuice?

7116 2018-08-27 07:57:32 There may be a clamouring for GST on petrol products. But there seems to be near unanimity among States & Centre that oil revenues help manage populist schemes. Even States need additional resources. Half the price goes to government as taxes now. The debate will go on till 2019.

7125 2018-08-27 07:54:57 It’s an old yoon rhetoric that they think our islands want independence from us specially since the oil is located there.
Biggest oil field is off west coast near Arran yet we can’t drill there because of Trident.

7158 2018-08-27 07:49:24 Simply outputting carbon via using indiscriminate prior sequestered carbon could overload the systems on Earth that re-sequesters carbon, i.e. Oceans as Methane Hydrate & Land as coal, oil & gas, creating more dynamic behavior and eventually a peak unrecoverable climate condition

7236 2018-08-27 07:33:41 Obvious set up that failed #r4today on Venezuela. I paraphrase conversation with ex Venezuelan minister. 

Why is it economic basket case?
Oil price collapse.

Not really, was fine until Maduro.
Is it lefty politics?
No. Maduro not left wing, actually opposite.

7276 2018-08-27 07:22:09 Very disappointed with justins interview of former venezualan oil minister. Many of the causes of current problems started under chavez.

7310 2018-08-27 07:17:17 Can we trust Radio 4 on what is really happening in Venezuela? The US only seems to take interest in countries with vast reserves of oil or those with socialist governments. I’m betting on another regime change - with lots of anti Maduro propaganda in the next few months.

7398 2018-08-27 07:00:05 Also, if you're nervous about medicine but want to try it, try CBD oil! It should be legal in a lot of places. It calms you down without making you high, like THC does, which is great for anxiety since you won't get the negative affects of cannabis like paranoia.

7615 2018-08-27 06:16:01 Well, I love ramen but palm oil is in ALL the instant varieties. Recently switched up to buying the fresh noodles (no palm oil) and separate stock/dashi. Little more expensive, just as tasty, less ethical conflict.
7616 2018-08-27 06:16:01 in all my years of murdering my hair, who knew all i needed was a few drops of jojoba/almond oil to make that shit soft and silky as fuck
7617 2018-08-27 06:15:58 Just skip AVATAR & save yourself the trouble of a overrated movie that clearly stole the plot points of SO MANY!!! Plus no one wants 4 sequels. James Cameron is drunk on oil sands juice!!!
7618 2018-08-27 06:15:49 The oil is for vaping or sublingual? Approx how long would 2 of those bottles last? I am having major back surgery in 2 weeks...
7619 2018-08-27 06:15:42 All of those play vital roles in the ecosystem. The dinosaur however, is an extinct fossil, symbol of a dead past and of course... the icon of oil and gas. What better animal?

7624 2018-08-27 06:14:50 For example, xalwo, it contains too much sugar and oil for people to take in by the pounds. Also our dietary decisions is gon kill.

7634 2018-08-27 06:11:30 Is an extremely painful subject for the data-as-oil narrative?
7635 2018-08-27 06:11:12 Don't understand this: "When LNG was imported, everyone cheered without thinking that it would be a debt burden.". How is it a debt burden? It replaced furnace oil a dirty expensive fuel. Just opening of 1st terminal resulted in savings of billion dollar/ yr because of arbitrage

7646 2018-08-27 06:08:43 I mean, just because it doesn't explicitly say "sustainably sourced palm oil", does that necessarily imply it's not sustainably sourced? oh well, some knowledge isn't destined for man

7691 2018-08-27 05:57:04 Just saw in a Business Insider article that Millennials are killing the oil industry. An industry that’s been one of the motivators for almost all armed conflict in the Middle East for the past half century. An industry that receives unneeded government subsidies and undermines

7931 2018-08-27 05:04:24 Doing the glaze after the gloss wash will dull it a bit, so you can swap them if you want more shine. Or do the standard Nuln Oil if you want a dull metal.

If any of your local stores carries the Reaper MSP series, it has a good gunmetal blue (and additional metallics).
7932 2018-08-27 05:04:08 You ended up saying nothing. No point in your tweet. For the past 6 months oil price has been more than $60 per barrel. What is exactly your point?
7933 2018-08-27 05:03:58 The debate was over years ago.   Decisions about abortions are between the woman and her doctor.  Canadians want forward movement about issues, not backwards.

7942 2018-08-27 05:02:17 Those three will all go a long ways. The Leadbelcher will give a darker highlight, the Nuln Oil Gloss will help give it all a moderate shine, and the Gulliman Blue will add the blueish tint.

8033 2018-08-27 04:44:19 #FLGeology is all about oil this week. Lots of learners are triggered about the well-published negatives thinking getting rid of oil is a good thing. Not so... it literally supports our food, technology, clothing, and so much more. Without it, the world economy will collapse

I used the garlic and herb olive oil, pepper, red peper if you like spicy, and salt.
8091 2018-08-27 04:31:16 Lmao I feel that! Yea, whatever oil you use on your scalp, try adding some tea tree oil to it and heat it up. Leave it in for about and hour or less(however you feel) rinse it out and BOOM...your scalp will love you. Lol

8168 2018-08-27 04:14:35 Both are wrong. A country's resources don't equal wealth. Explain how  Venezuela has the most oil reserves and people were hunting animals in  the park for food? The real answer is corruption and politics... like  nationalizing private land.

8188 2018-08-27 04:11:33 The same is true for big oil, healthcare, and banking. Very rarely do politicians try to regulate these industries because they get paid not to regulate them. This administration gave them fewer regulations, and a pocket full of money to share with the GOP. 2/2

8306 2018-08-27 03:49:53 Roasted spaghetti squash - so easy! Olive oil, salt, pepper and chicken meatballs 
8307 2018-08-27 03:49:38 裸に腹巻はちょっと・・
8308 2018-08-27 03:49:36 Upper Ojai Valley: Oil tank on fire in the hills near Santa Paula Ojai Road and Sisar Road. Copter 3 over head with E20 reporting active fire. E20 in a defensive mode.
8309 2018-08-27 03:49:25 oh!イル
8310 2018-08-27 03:49:23 @MrPeanut got nothing on me. Just give up. Nobody actually likes a sticky nasty paste made from peanuts and oil. Pb&j should only be J
8311 2018-08-27 03:49:13 “It’s so hot that you can cook an egg on the side wok!” - Me, when I’m making fried rice and the oil is heating up
8312 2018-08-27 03:48:53 OIL OIL OIL . と紙に書くとサザエさんに聞こえる。
8313 2018-08-27 03:48:46 What works for me might not work for you! But I would suggest not using anything that is for oily skin to dry out the oil! I’m honestly trash and have just been using body lotion on my face and it’s been great for me!
8314 2018-08-27 03:48:38 Oil industry guys love it when he  does the pipeline explosion sound! 
8315 2018-08-27 03:48:11 The U.S is after Turkana oil.simple!
8316 2018-08-27 03:47:59 Gotta be OIL OF EVERY PEARLS UN-INSIDES
8317 2018-08-27 03:47:40 I hate when mfs make all the weights and bars greasy at the gym... like y’all sweating vegetable oil or what ?
8318 2018-08-27 03:47:39 for example, if i see a Nazi chanting “Blood and Oil” in Charlottesville, I know what he means and I know he’s being racist, even if he botched his wording. but regardless, the fact I recognize his racism doesn’t make me racist too. that just seems self-evident.
8319 2018-08-27 03:47:25 Oh, and 9 out of 10 penguins agree, @DawnDish is great at getting oil out of feathers. Probably fur, too!
8320 2018-08-27 03:47:03 one day for my mans anniversary imma put baby oil on my body and make a music video for him

Thyme, Peppermint, Eucalyptus, Grapefruit Peel pure essential oils - P200
Castor Oil - P200
Grapeseed Oil (carrier oil)- P250
8323 2018-08-27 03:46:09 I think I'll make it hard on him to catch me, by rubbing oil all over first...that way I slip through his fingers in case he does catch me ;)   I challenge him to, though, and then the boobs are his prize...along with something else that'd be wet
8324 2018-08-27 03:46:09 We will be fair, just, yet don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
8325 2018-08-27 03:46:07 You earn rights by collective power.  The gay community sent Obama to the White House and he took care of them.  Oil men put GW in office and he took care of them.  WS put Trump in office and he took care of them.  Just giving votes to democrats does nothing at all.
8326 2018-08-27 03:45:22 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
8327 2018-08-27 03:44:54 @AlmarMarinas here is their mission statement I have been without shore power since 08/17/2018 the attached pic shows the Court yard there are rats eating the garbage we have raccoons and behind this pic is 5 gal containers that have oil diesel fuel and gas

8328 2018-08-27 03:44:53 I feel like I should be tweeting this, nigga your dark skin ...you supposed to be rubbing your body down in oil making workout videos
8329 2018-08-27 03:44:50 Idk which is worse. This or on my car having the oil filter fire off while driving home from work one night.
8330 2018-08-27 03:44:46 Just switched to shade grown coffee. Already won’t eat anything with palm oil... Why did it take so long to learn about coffee?? It’s actually difficult to find.

8334 2018-08-27 03:44:03 誰にも邪魔させない！
8335 2018-08-27 03:43:58 I proposed this to a friend a few months back. Two beautiful coastlines, year round growing season, huge oil reserves. 

We could just run like a one year open border thing, and by the end 70% of Mexicans will be up here. Invade, and build a wall on our new northern border.
8336 2018-08-27 03:43:53 Plus my oil change be like $160 I wouldn’t wish my car on my worst enemy
8337 2018-08-27 03:43:46 But the smart thing to do would be to no longer invest in new fossil fuel infrastructure and only invest in renewables. Yet he did both. Oil production increased under Obama.

8341 2018-08-27 03:43:37 I usually have HORRIBLE cramps the week or two before my cycle but a friend told me to take a shot of apple cider vinegar and a tea spoon of coconut oil every day... sounds swords and taste horrible (lol) but I’ve noticed a difference.
8342 2018-08-27 03:43:28 I had someone come in with a freshly rebuilt engine that I did this to their oil filter.
Someone had painted the block and then threaded the filter on while wet basically thread locking it to the block.  hurt myself trying to get it off
8343 2018-08-27 03:43:25 This stuff is so interesting.  Bookmarked for future reading.  Starting to burn the midnight oil here.
8344 2018-08-27 03:43:24 Oil it down or something
8345 2018-08-27 03:43:23 War is to the 21st century what oil was to the 20th; the pillar that supports the global economy.
8346 2018-08-27 03:42:57 Also helps to buy Nevada Power.  And to own the railroad that transports all the oil from Canada and the Dakotas to the gulf.  Live good
8347 2018-08-27 03:42:56 @satejpatilmos Gokul milk has a visible layer of palm oil on it these days.
8348 2018-08-27 03:42:22 I’m going to take my car to the dealership to do the oil change and a New York inspection done #toyota
8349 2018-08-27 03:41:52 fucken got oil in my eye
8350 2018-08-27 03:41:45 Sorry to hear about your previous health problems and happy you are healthy. Hope the oil plant was somewhat held responsible. Still cant discredit the u.s role in advancing medical technology.
8351 2018-08-27 03:41:23 Mustard is still better in some way 
But we are using refined palm oil, vanaspati, cottonseed oil, soybean oil etc. Affluent also use Con-ola oil.  So also safflower oil is used by all
8352 2018-08-27 03:41:19 The cause is what we believe. It's that part most people get confused about. We've all been made to believe it's circumstances beyond our control which dictates our life. But what we believe is the oil to life and if there is no oil, the engine locks up.
8353 2018-08-27 03:41:13 We need a hooves on thick oil foostep type of sound
8354 2018-08-27 03:41:09 ini mungkin jawaban ter-mainstream di wf, tapi, aku pake rosehip oil & vit. E kleveru, perlahan memudar bekas hitamnya 
8355 2018-08-27 03:40:37 yes,anti-religion as everyone should be but not at the order of the government or any authority. Religion is harmful. It’s irrational that’s why Abiye was able to sell snake oil reform  by invoking “Igziabher etiopian yibark” to the masses while Queero is terrorizing the people.

8357 2018-08-27 03:40:30 All the olive oil I see at the grocery store is either virgin or extra virgin. I kinda wanna see what the highly promiscuous olive oils are like, just for comparison.
8358 2018-08-27 03:40:22 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
8359 2018-08-27 03:40:22 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

8369 2018-08-27 03:39:14 Which Government undertaking bakes profit? Unless it is monopoly entity. Like ONGC Indian Oil. Look at Indian Railways say they  recover 57% fare with Monopoly status. What will happen when competition faced. Sir please denounce #FLEXIFARE #expkoitpassebger invoke #MRTPact
8370 2018-08-27 03:39:08 The world has no perfect people in it.  The Gulf has recovered.  The Exxon Valdez oil spill cannot be discerned.  Nature has a great capacity to recover from both minor and fairly major events.

8372 2018-08-27 03:38:53 Why cant coal miners be corn farmers that produce oil to be burned to create heat and electricity?   We dont need coal.

8374 2018-08-27 03:38:10 Who developed Uttarandhra so far, surely not BJP, neither during ABV too. All those came up in Vizag, be it port, dockyard, oil companies, steel plant, all came in Congress rule only. Why Modi isn't clearing the file of steel plant owning a mine of its own. Shame on Modi
8375 2018-08-27 03:37:58 So they must support building refineries in Canada,

Nationalizing our oil would also benefit our economy.

Or is the thriving economy just lip service?

8584 2018-08-27 03:06:10 If you can hold out long enough to get the supplies, I recommend getting a deep conditioner (wella luxe oil keratin restore mask is what got my mats out) put that on your hair and then sit in a super steamy shower, don’t let the water hit your hair just let the seam help the mask
8585 2018-08-27 03:06:10 So I guess we'll stop subsidizing Big Oil, farmers, military contractors, etc...Since "collectivism" is a bad thing?

8588 2018-08-27 03:05:54 Worst thing about the video is the number of sheep that meekly follow this lunatic. Just another snake oil salesman using religion to scam, deceive & divide Americans. Christian religion as it stands is source of much of the evil that fills our world today.

1, beer + salt - cleaning the door and window rails
2, beer + toothpaste - clean kitchen oil
3, beer + baking soda - clean water stains
Let's try it!

8590 2018-08-27 03:05:17 Well said, and it often gets overlooked with our PM's pipeline issues. IIRC, grain is next to oil as potential to export?
8591 2018-08-27 03:04:32 Thanks @maxwellivey for the follow. I just followed back. I live in Calgary, Alberta, the oil industry head office capital in Canada. There are hourly flights between Calgary & Houston. Thanks for doing what you do. Obviously, you don't know being blind as a disability.#overcomer

8599 2018-08-27 03:03:12 It could be the carrier oil!
8600 2018-08-27 03:02:47 No. Even processed coconut oil is better than butter.
8601 2018-08-27 03:02:35 Oh my god you are so delusional.  Tell your buddy Shawn to stop feeding you these fake stories and just oil you up like I am sure he does every night.
8602 2018-08-27 03:02:33 the smell of Pink Oil has been changed & doesn’t bring back memories of my mom screaming at me to sit still. doesn’t seem right smh
8603 2018-08-27 03:02:26 And high in seed oils, I'll bet. At least in Singapore, I see plenty of sesame seed oil.

8619 2018-08-27 02:59:48 Let’s let the market work as it will. It’s expensive oil that will come out of that pipe.

8623 2018-08-27 02:59:16 Raw honey, greek yogurt, tea tree oil, black castor oil and jojoba. Sometimes I put aspirin in mine because it has salicylic acid and that helps with my psoriasis inflammation directly

8627 2018-08-27 02:58:34 ...for example oil companies have a history of covering up climate change data for their own interest, cigarette companies did the same with their product, and every company fights tooth and nail to prevent their workers from unionizing...

8629 2018-08-27 02:58:17 Sounds more like a state-wide investment plan, funded by private business. Entities invested purely by private business (oil revenues), without any taxation, is capitalism. Entities funded by taxation and other collections from the people is socialism.

8633 2018-08-27 02:57:52 Turns out I was wrong, there is an essential oil that comes from the cannabis flower.
8634 2018-08-27 02:57:25 Big Oil is lobbying Congress to get money to protect its infrastructure from the effects of Climate Change.  My outrage meter is broken.
8635 2018-08-27 02:57:15 So what would 5% of the Russia oil deal trump brokered at the Mayfower Hotel on April 27 2016 be? Seems unlikely given Trump has not lifted sanctions.
8636 2018-08-27 02:57:12 Look up shale gas/ oil in 10 years it should be cost effective and we only have to destroy an environment from oil drilling because we don’t have to go down in the earth that far

8669 2018-08-27 02:51:34 I can make the argument that anyone working on an oil rig is immoral because they are participating voluntarily (it's not a skill-less job) in the decimation of our planet. Maybe its Catholic school talking, but I gotta be sure before I condemn someone to hell...

-Coconut oil is PURE POISON
-Saturated fats are ALL POISON
-Forehead wrinkles ARE POISON
-Sears/Kmart closing, Why? POISON
-Bitcoin is DEFINITELY BAD POISON

8686 2018-08-27 02:49:22 If there’s at least one good skincare tip I can give you all, It’s this: coconut oil is NOT a moisturizer. It is a sealant. It will clog your pores and then go bad in your face. Stop putting it on your skin.

8725 2018-08-27 02:42:43 My friend had cirrhosis grading, 15, on biopsy before Hep C drugs, used coconut oil and turmeric after successful Tx, grading now 7.6 a year later (<12 is non-cirrhotic, <5 is normal). Drs amazed - reversal of cirrhosis, He was given 6 months to live.
8726 2018-08-27 02:42:41 Have your oil changed, and replace the filter.
8727 2018-08-27 02:42:38 Honestly I think it's more complicated than big oil. There is a strong weird stubbornness to conservatives. It isn't just the environment but any time any expert says "this is bad" or "you should do this". It's the party that opposed helmet/seat belt laws.
8728 2018-08-27 02:42:33 And the head casket will blow oil and antifreeze all into the cylinders, at 3 thousand miles...

Just saying... Ha!

Nice build, by the way...
8729 2018-08-27 02:42:16 おっはこんにちはー
再びの酷暑…危険な暑さです。水分・ミネラル補給と疲れてなくても、適期的にしっかり一休みして乗り切りましょうね=͟͟͞͞(; •̀д•́)))
8730 2018-08-27 02:42:03 With garlic and good quality olive oil on a charcoal grill? Oh yeah.
8731 2018-08-27 02:41:55 Its unfortunate you believe a biased documentary over what you can physically go see firsthand. It is bringing prosperity to indigenous people and pays for health care, education, infrastructure across Canada. Its cleaner than oil from California, Alaska and Venezuela.
8732 2018-08-27 02:41:49 Yeah. I usually lose at least 1/2 my muffin that way. Spraying nonstick olive oil spray in the silicone pan has been what works for me
8733 2018-08-27 02:41:45 I take any type of “decent” moisturizer and add some argon oil to it. But my normal treatment is rose water and glycerin + aloe Vera gel + argon. Little much but just need it one time in the morning and I’m set to glow for the day.
8734 2018-08-27 02:41:44 No. I do not want everyone to have guns. Most people on the planet cannot change the oil in their car much less handle a tool such as a "gun."  But, it IS their RIGHT to own one, once proper background checks are followed.  It's called responsibility.
8735 2018-08-27 02:41:28 Some new shit at lush “Scrubee Body Butter” it’s pretty moisturizing too but I still add my own oil after my shower
8736 2018-08-27 02:41:27 [$6.84 Save 52%] #LightningDeal 83% claimed: Mosquito Repellent Bracelet 12pcs, 100% All Natural Plant-Based Oil, Non-Toxic Travel Insect Repellent, Safe Deet-Free Band, Soft Fiber Material For Kids & Adults, Keeps Insects & Bugs Away - #Amazon Deals 2018
8737 2018-08-27 02:40:59 Nobody cares. It’s not like every person is going to get a bill in the mail. We invested in schools, hospitals, & infrastructure during an oil price trough & the economy is strong now because of it. I’ll happily take the debt over the alternative of slash & burn. #ableg #medhat
8738 2018-08-27 02:40:39 Así fue,oil creció como misil 2002_2008 ,una interrupcion crisis 2008, inyección de la fed recuperó la liquidez,duró todo hasta 2011 y de ahí se acabó la fiesta, lateral hasta derrumbarse en 2014. Chau comodities , no más u$. El ladron sin plata, no pudo robar, cayo Dilma
8739 2018-08-27 02:40:38 Lmao okay I was gonna say well first of all I watched the video uploaded in may about hydrating your hair. You put so much effect into creating the intro! I was so fascinated , what software did you use? Secondly, I died laughing when the oil bottle became a hot potato 
8740 2018-08-27 02:40:33 たらこって美味いよな！
8741 2018-08-27 02:40:11 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
8742 2018-08-27 02:40:02 Rancid KFC oil & flop sweat.
8743 2018-08-27 02:39:55 Most of us don’t watch it, Ezra still has a lot of residual good will though from his anti-human rights tribunal and ethical oil crusades which were widely embraced   among conservative supporters.
8744 2018-08-27 02:39:53 On god. No atm’s after sun down unless an emergency. And if I’m not at work or 100+ miles away ain’t no pumping of gas or going to get oil changed lol
8745 2018-08-27 02:39:50 i just got carded for buying olive oil happy sunday
8746 2018-08-27 02:39:50 @Apple under every corporation's  the thin/think layer of dollars lies the extremely thick layer of filth. That stinks. Steve Jobs was a sick man. He extracted info from others by sweet talk/ luring/ and plain cheating. his 2nd wife a more crooked woman was his right match.
8747 2018-08-27 02:39:12 I also don’t know how to change my own oil 
How dare you point that out 
8748 2018-08-27 02:39:02 I use a combination of Bio Oil (absorbs right away/not greasy) & La Roche-Posay Toleriane moisturizer (with sunscreen) it’s cleared both my dry skin & ended my cystic acne flair ups. Rice and Clean from @PLANTapothecary is also an incredible cleanser that doesn’t dry my skin out
8749 2018-08-27 02:39:01 Baby oil is now my best friend 
8750 2018-08-27 02:38:58 I don't think that IBM, Ford, GM, Standard Oil and other companies wants to let all of its business practices known because of their involvement leading up to and actually lasted into and after WWII started and was going on after the U.S. declared war on Nazi Germany and Italy.
8751 2018-08-27 02:38:55 I understand having to be realistic with the American electorate.  Climate change is particularly frustrating.  When other European countries go carbon-free, even China making huge strides...our entire political system is hostage to Big Oil, heck we still heavily subsidize them.
8752 2018-08-27 02:38:50 Agreed brother I’m just doing the oil and it’s been Near life-changing.
8753 2018-08-27 02:38:48 Standard oil?
8754 2018-08-27 02:38:25 Its not FDA regulated so you can sell "olive oil" even if it is only 3% olive oil
8755 2018-08-27 02:38:17 もちゃんがしっかり合いの手カバーしてくれたのでぼくは安心して歌えました◎w昨日はありがとう〜！
8756 2018-08-27 02:38:11 If you don’t have one already, get an essential oil diffuser and some peppermint oil. Works wonders 
8757 2018-08-27 02:37:56 I need an oil change but I want to buy @JeffreeStar skin frost and blood sugar palette instead.
8758 2018-08-27 02:37:46 and I did rear brakes and changed the oil on my truck. Gave it a wash and shine too.
8759 2018-08-27 02:37:37 Yeah your correct Venezuela facing very critical problem even though they have largest oil reserve in the world.
8760 2018-08-27 02:37:33 i can feel the coconut oil just "schhhhhlp" sliding down my face
8761 2018-08-27 02:37:29 Pablo quizás ya lo sabes, oil and gas journal y el hydrocarbon processing, son populares internacionalmente. Generalmente tienen estadísticas ir país.
8762 2018-08-27 02:37:23 tbd oil
8763 2018-08-27 02:37:23 Me and Lina picked out this one burning oil cause it smells like a man and it got me in here missing someone who don’t even exist
8764 2018-08-27 02:37:22 It’s like saying my wife doesn’t know how to change the oil in my car pffff. Would I get backlash? Maybe? But I don’t really give a fuck and neither should you. It was just a comment, and she’s right, most men don’t know how to use a dishwasher
8765 2018-08-27 02:36:51 A coconut oil mask makes my hair smell like the bottomside of nanaimo bars.....
8766 2018-08-27 02:36:35 Be nice & ask the employees. Sometimes managers cut corners against policy for an example like mixing their frying oils together at the end of the day or week even though it is suppose to be separated. That dedicated fry only fryer could have been topped off w/ onion ring oil.
8767 2018-08-27 02:36:29 try checking their excel skills. But yes, they can post a screenshot. Credit must be given.
8768 2018-08-27 02:36:14 自首？
8769 2018-08-27 02:36:01 I would rather read your views on oil and gas, hydraulic fracturing in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Quebec, LNG terminals, and pipelines.
8770 2018-08-27 02:36:01 i was doing so good with not popping any pimples but i popped like 5 in the shower so i have to sit here with coconut oil on my face
8771 2018-08-27 02:36:00 This blueberry peppermint oil got my scalp on fiyah!!!! I can feel the hair sprouting out my scalp!!
8772 2018-08-27 02:35:26 We should speed  up the replacement of fossil fuels by solar, wind, and geothermal.  However, your support for fracking is anthithetical to the idea of keeping fossil fuels in the ground.  Fracking is a way to increase the longevity and production of oil and gas.
8773 2018-08-27 02:35:22 This Govt. is literally doing nothing to bring down oil prices. Putting the responsibility on the State's shoulder, dodging the bullet. We need to bring Change!!
8774 2018-08-27 02:35:15 So I started putting coconut oil in my hair; let’s hope I see results soon
8775 2018-08-27 02:35:10 I was driving behind a really bad driver this afternoon and they had a giant Doterra essential oils sign on the back of their car. I thought they had an oil for everything but I guess they don’t have one to make bad drivers good. 
8776 2018-08-27 02:35:09 My mother would have tried to mop the dirt off the campsite & Murphys Oil Soap the trees.
8777 2018-08-27 02:34:59 Monster pairings.
Gelatinous cube with digmaul.
Fire elemental with roiling oil.
Phase spider with ethereal filcher.
Troll with abjurer that knows protection from energy.
8778 2018-08-27 02:34:52 Mum. I don’t know what kind of hair oil that was. But I’m pretty sure my head is singing a song of ‘fire and ice’ right now
8779 2018-08-27 02:34:37 i’ve been using the olive oil shampoo i did try the restorative hair mask nothing to write home about
8780 2018-08-27 02:34:35 Thinking Conservatives agree with your assessment. This trajectory also gives US permanent debt servitude to China and oil monarchies. Add the multi-billion $$ DT casino and real estate bankruptcies. Only thing consistent about this entity is moral and financial bankruptcy 
8781 2018-08-27 02:34:24 Machine oil
8782 2018-08-27 02:34:17 BUT HONESTLY A BITCH IS SUFFERING.  no one ever comes to Midland. What good is being an oil town if no kpop groups know you exist.
8783 2018-08-27 02:34:14 I believe overwhelming circumstantial 
Evidence is
Trump/Schwarzman and cronies 
Received just around 4.5% of total Shares in Worlds Largest Oil Company Rosneft 
Glencore got .54%
Qatar 14.16%
So much data points this way
8784 2018-08-27 02:34:07 Probably either Dirty Computer or Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides
8785 2018-08-27 02:33:42 Men, you actually oil your beard?!
8786 2018-08-27 02:33:41 Yep, green! idk I used to wash everyday then stopped& it was bad at first but then it's like it got used to it& wasnt as oily! Washing everyday creates more oil bc your body is trying to replace it. You may just have more oily hair tho, my sisters is that way
8787 2018-08-27 02:33:40 I need new beard oil, this just for men shit trash
8788 2018-08-27 02:33:31 100%..which is why Leafs Nation would be wise to tread carefully...especially with their history being what it is.
8789 2018-08-27 02:33:29 Duh.  Okay Mr. Obvious. Those people are morons or work for the oil companies.
8790 2018-08-27 02:33:16 I used to keep my Himalayan Salt Rocks on it and my oil diffuser, twas ahmazing!
8791 2018-08-27 02:33:00 Remove sticky tape with eucalyptus oil. So just increase pressure on #ScuMo and the #LNPbctirrmhl will fall apart. Polls already showing what is coming and only going to get worse for them.
8792 2018-08-27 02:32:47 Peppermint oil is great for headaches...the insane tingling feeling definitely distracts me from the incessant pounding of my left temple...
8793 2018-08-27 02:32:41 A Harvard professor’s assertion that the oil is like “poison” is just one more battle in the coconut oil wars.
8794 2018-08-27 02:32:35 Once you have kfc with water and squeeze the oil out with some napkins, it healthy.
8795 2018-08-27 02:32:10 He looks like he's waiting to get his oil changed.
8796 2018-08-27 02:32:08 Again, NOT true. Most of Costa Rica's HOUSEHOLD ELECTRICITY is from "Renewables, That amounts to only about a quarter of the nations energy consumption, the bulk of the rest? Oil lol Idiot
8797 2018-08-27 02:31:55 Young HP Omen 
8798 2018-08-27 02:31:47 Looks to me like the masked man washes his hair in oil..
8799 2018-08-27 02:31:43 Get the oil out Let’s make us a movie shawty
8800 2018-08-27 02:31:37 (e) What’s your plan to to fix all the potholes on the roads ? 
(g) What’s your plan to have cheaper fuel at the pump? 
(h) What’s your plan to promote Canadian Oil? 
(I) I think you have been doing a decent job but you need to address these issues and more. #oct1
8801 2018-08-27 02:31:16 Coconut oil after u shower
8802 2018-08-27 02:31:07 Slice and put on avocado toast with cracked pepper, sea salt (or Himalayan salt) olive oil and balsamic glaze drizzle!!
8803 2018-08-27 02:31:06 I feel cleansed of my sins after a face mask and some rosehip oil lol
8804 2018-08-27 02:30:52 Why would they be desperate?He can never be president again..and he didn’t create the economic collapse.. bush did chasing “terrorists” which is code for oil or control of a regions resources and banking system.tweeting propaganda to the conservative extremist base is your legacy
8805 2018-08-27 02:30:51 It just dissolved into the oil...

8809 2018-08-27 02:30:08 August 26, 2018 at 10:30PM Waiting for #Ecuador to admit Petroecuador oil spills
8810 2018-08-27 02:29:26 Except when the killer is a father of 3 who kills is wife and kids and throws them in a oil rig. Which if going by the numbers happens far more often than mass shooters, cause irregardless.
8811 2018-08-27 02:29:23 Nobody should use that f***in fryer when the oil is that dark. Lisa Marie and Aaron definitely know how to #ShutItDown #BarRescue
8812 2018-08-27 02:29:22 I also only asked a question.  But Evangelical snake oil salesmen aren't there to answer questions, just count the money in the tithe envelopes.
8813 2018-08-27 02:29:15 peppermint oil is the best essential oil. i love it so much
8814 2018-08-27 02:28:59 Olive oil

8816 2018-08-27 02:28:51 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
8817 2018-08-27 02:28:48 CBD oil is great for Sunday scaries
8818 2018-08-27 02:28:21 using the coconut oil that my grandma sent me as part of a vegan recipe kit as moisturizer. this is palm tree primitivism
8819 2018-08-27 02:28:15 OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-INSIDES
8820 2018-08-27 02:27:50 I forgot how much I love the smell of baby oil.
8821 2018-08-27 02:27:36 Overheard - if a PPP person did  what Imran did - Ishq with a married woman and then her husband steps aside - he’d be ruined in the media.
8822 2018-08-27 02:27:12 Lubed is just a formula for success.

Cast a beautiful woman, oil her up, and then fuck her  
8823 2018-08-27 02:26:58 I burn like a grilled cheese thrown on a hot pan stove on high with no oil or butter (made sense in my head)
8824 2018-08-27 02:26:20 The US also increased oil output while prices dropped. I wonder why capitalism is impervious to price drops, but socialism is so vulnerable to them? I think socialism is super weak, that's why.

8827 2018-08-27 02:26:15 My taxi driver in Bombay would totally support the Democrats if they would stop sonic testing for oil off the Atlantic coast.
8828 2018-08-27 02:25:53 I know I’m late to the party but I started using this coconut oil infused hair mask and idk why I didn’t before this stuff is incredible! It smells great and makes my hair so soft and full! I’m so glad I found this stuff!
8829 2018-08-27 02:25:49 Omg yes! I love CR! And the ancient Egyptian line from mane choice, and Mielle protein free conditioner and their almond mint oil ! That’s what I’m addicted to rn

8832 2018-08-27 02:24:56 self care is vaping lavender oil
8833 2018-08-27 02:24:54 There were leaked photos. Reham is safe. But then I’m going by standard good looks.
8834 2018-08-27 02:24:51 people are always taking about big oil. several small oils, taken together, can often be just as bad
8835 2018-08-27 02:24:25 Love it. Never retire your shoes. They become car washing, oil change, run to Lowes, quick errand to Dad’s house type of shoes. Never, no never retire shoes 
8836 2018-08-27 02:24:14 Whatttt the Jamaican black castor oil one is the love of my lifeeeee . Have you ever tried Camille Rose? It’s a little pricier but it's so worth it. I used to run away from it and now I can’t stop  being it after trying.
8837 2018-08-27 02:24:08 The USA economy is coming back, we're not in the Paris Accord or TTP,  NK released prisioners and is dismantling their nuke program, oil is being produced by the USA again, stupid govt regs are cut, corp taxes are cut, and John Brennan hates Trump. #tcot #ccot #MAGA
8838 2018-08-27 02:23:41 In Europe a number of countries have gone weeks without the need to burn coal, oil or gas - also in the USA Hawaii has a 100% renewable grid, Norway like wise
8839 2018-08-27 02:23:35 This is Not an Alberta company.  It is @safeguard01 out of FT ST JOHN BC! This equipment is designed for fracing and oil and gas field service. IT JUST ALSO HAPPENS TO AMAZING EQUIPMENT TO FIGHT FOREST FIRES AND HELP PROTECT HOMES!
8840 2018-08-27 02:23:31 Comity between brothers is like oil running down the beard of Abraham, or something.
8841 2018-08-27 02:23:31 CBD oil has made a world of difference in our dog. It can’t replace her vet prescribed drugs, but as a supplement to the other meds, it’s has greatly improved her quality of life. She’s so much happier and playful than before.
8842 2018-08-27 02:22:56 is that the same time period for Burma 800 millions dollar oil scam or STO tea plantations scam

8850 2018-08-27 02:20:51 darned if I know-

never tipped him-
8851 2018-08-27 02:20:50 Finally got to work on finishing my oil paintings.  The Onion Bowl is finally finished.  Making good progress on Tea Time.  Not quite finished yet.

8853 2018-08-27 02:20:47 A good avocado with good tomatoes and a piece of bread is a meal within itself. A little olive oil. Yes boo.
8854 2018-08-27 02:20:20 Haaaaa snake oil.? Pun intended.
8855 2018-08-27 02:20:16 I have a bracelet I wear that I put lavender oil on. It helps, not just with smell of the lavender, but because I can fiddle with it if need be.
8856 2018-08-27 02:20:16 Just swallowed a fish oil pill dry. The world is my oyster.
8857 2018-08-27 02:20:11 $tesla needs crude oil for all moving parts, don't you know? All production components need coal fired electrical plants for parts and mining of raw materials, don't you know? Be honest, it's a fire sale...
8858 2018-08-27 02:19:54 Panaway essential oil
8859 2018-08-27 02:19:45 Snake oil charges that mean nothing.
No crime commited.

This is a bit redicilous considering our POTUS turns down his own paycheck!

Rabid dogs are thankless for good will fine towards them.
8860 2018-08-27 02:19:42 I will hopefully be testing CBD oil and tinctures for #crohnsdisease  and #arthritis #pain control soon.  Take care friends!#opioidcrisis
8861 2018-08-27 02:19:41 I told Sharon you would say to taste it when I thought it was oil

My PV system will run for 30, 60, 100 years, then it will be 99% recycled. Your FUD is utter BS.  Instead of oil slicks, when my fuel spills it is called a sunny day.

8909 2018-08-27 02:11:54 I don’t think these studies should be the definitive yes or no to taking fish oil. More information is needed in terms of risk factors (genetic) other health concerns (obesity, lack of exercise). Let’s look at the subsets and compare...

9013 2018-08-27 01:56:00 It’s lookin like an original oil painting of a Dinokitty by the incredible artist that is Mab Graves. Check out her magical work!
9014 2018-08-27 01:55:45 I totally believe in global warming and I got kicked in the butt for it. I can see why Republicans like Ronald Reagan say trees produce more pollution than cars, because Republicans own such factories and oil companies. George W. Bush, for example. Dick Cheney; Haliburton.
9015 2018-08-27 01:55:37 *he smiles* "Alright, you strip while I get the oil."
9016 2018-08-27 01:55:31 I don’t like orange oil I feel like it reminds me of cleaning products lmaoo
9017 2018-08-27 01:55:28 All the plastics on your phone. Computer and vehicles are all high in oil based products. 85% of all hosputL products are oil based.  Your PV system when degraded is an enviro nightmare to dispose of
9018 2018-08-27 01:55:27 Sweetheart table. Walnut top rubbed with some Danish oil. Bottom is just pine painted a matte white. I'm going to do another coat then attach the top later this week.
9019 2018-08-27 01:55:24 I make this rice and it’s freaking amazing! It’s uncle bens parboiled rice and instead of using butter or oil I use bacon grease. I add a can of black beans, cilantro, lime juice and cumin. It’s like crack dude.

9024 2018-08-27 01:55:04 Five years later: that oil no longer feeds the people who do not have a horizontally developed economy to fall back on, but that oil money is helping the children of Goldman Sachs bankers get an education. Thank God for that!
9025 2018-08-27 01:54:58 this is not the truth of the matter  if one looks at all the info it would be wise to study the issue the other big participants actions are not laid out from d.c. its only about the oil from the beginning

9029 2018-08-27 01:54:15 The bit that got me was $560,000 from less than 1000 patients in the entire country. I'd love to know the breakdown on those #domestic sales and how/where they are spilt..whole flower, cannabis oil, extractions, etc.. #AUSPOL #Cannabis #CannabisLegalisation
9030 2018-08-27 01:54:10 Accidentally started researching the Model X.

It's stupid expensive but no oil changes Stupid cheap energy

He scoffed as he conceptualized a plan.
9032 2018-08-27 01:54:00 I know it doesn't seem like a lot, but I made $70 this week alone with roller bottles & my essential oil balms. That's miniscule but 6 mos ago that would have seemed impossible!

9034 2018-08-27 01:53:53 I marinated some pork strips in chili paste, garlic, ginger, soy sauce & sesame oil then cooked it on the stove. Ooweee

9038 2018-08-27 01:53:27 This is why I say, "I didn't leave the Republican Party, it left me." I used to be an Eisenhower Republican but could no longer rationalize that it was my Party anymore after they took US into Iraq. The blood of our military to pay for oil was not okay.

9041 2018-08-27 01:52:47 There wasn't a war against a small weak oil rich nation McCain didn't support. Hundreds of thousands dead. Countries destroyed. Populations condemned to desperate struggle for generations
9042 2018-08-27 01:52:45 oh i meant like a weed vaporizer! bot for nicotine. and yeah cbd oil is really subtle for anxiety in my experience, not very helpful

9044 2018-08-27 01:52:31 I don't agree with you much on anything. But you got me here. Rubio is a clown. A snake oil salesman of the worst kind.

9046 2018-08-27 01:52:23 Try the Shea moisture Jamaican black castor oil masque. It’s amazing
9047 2018-08-27 01:52:20 This is quack science.  I drink fish oil and feel great.
9048 2018-08-27 01:52:06 Amen, wherever you are stuck coming to God, He loves you. Through prayer done diligently will move heaven and God sends down His angel to break all the chains that hold your life. Believe, new oil will be poured out because the power of God's grace frees you..
9049 2018-08-27 01:52:05 I thought President Clinton selling our Navy's oil supplies took care of our debt.

9053 2018-08-27 01:51:18 My point is to move forward. HC is history and the party is changing.  I'm optimistic that the URC rec'ds adopted will move the party to listen more to voters.   But I'm skeptical of DNC accepting Oil & Gas $$ when it touts climate change concerns or problems caused by pipelines.
9054 2018-08-27 01:51:14 chivalry is never dead .. I’ll even light it for u too .. make it pretty ... spiral some hash oil on it and roll it in keef...

9056 2018-08-27 01:51:02 And Hoxsey's herbs were fine, but I noticed that his protocol took months, often half a year.  Much slower than mine, but then he was just using supplements and herbs, didn't know about Rife or flaxseed oil.  Still, he cured a lot of hopeless cases, I wouldn't write him off.

9066 2018-08-27 01:49:20 I’ve gotta say, reading a Midnight Oil bio rn, and having read quite a few accounts of 80’s OZ bands, I would really love if we could play more. Every week. Not possible is it? Why?
9067 2018-08-27 01:48:31 Often wonder how watching your brother basically getting fried to death by boiling doughnut oil affects your soul.
9068 2018-08-27 01:48:17 We allow Russia to buy a lot in this country- condos and birth certificates in Florida and New York, oil sands in Utah, platinum in Montana, Congressmen and women, Senators, Presidents......

9071 2018-08-27 01:47:14 Moisture is the key to growth retention. Try to go heatless. Also try the LOC method. (Leave in conditioner, oil, cream)
9072 2018-08-27 01:47:04 Roasted veggies can kind of feel satisfying snack-wise without carbs. I cut up carrots/broccoli/zucchini-cauliflower, toss in a little olive oil, salt, pepper and roast them @ 400 for 25 min on a cookie sheet w/foil, stir them, put them in for 15-20 min more
9073 2018-08-27 01:47:01 I wanna try CBD oil for my anxiety. Has anyone tried it? I don’t wanna be on my meds anymore, and truthfully I feel like they aren’t working as great. So I’m looking for other ways to help me!!!
9074 2018-08-27 01:46:43 Lavender is my favorite essential oil.
9075 2018-08-27 01:46:38 Sounds like it might be a spark plug problem. Did you bring it to the shop yet? Also (this sounds silly), see how much oil is in the tank. If it’s either of those things, it’s inexpensive (maybe like $150-200?)

9081 2018-08-27 01:45:19 Thomas, this is intriguing. Please keep digging for more info.
Maybe these guys are those xnational mercs employed by ME gov'ts & global oil co's when Western gov't coalition forces started drawing down over the last decade. These guys must be combining spec skills & weapons.

9086 2018-08-27 01:44:46 what are beauty gummies? and i'd recommend epsom salt & essential oil soaks if you have a tub! lavender or rose are especially good for the skin & relaxation. citrus or rosemary is better for renewing energy.
9087 2018-08-27 01:44:36 You good skin hoes annoy me.  get the CeraVe facial cleaners for dry skin, Thayers witch hazel toner, and an oil like vitamin e, seeet almond, or rose hip seed at night. And in the morning your face won’t feel dry

9104 2018-08-27 01:41:07 I love it. I bough a travel size for now. All boar bristle because I have long fine hair. My scalp tends to be itchy and it scratches it so well lolz And it distributes sebum till the very hair ends. I didn't know I had that much oil on my hair till i started using it.
9105 2018-08-27 01:41:00 When you have ADVANCED symptoms like I did, I can't say for sure if just the zapper and flaxseed oil alone would have worked for me.  There are reasons for every extra thing I did, but my attitude is cancer is a tough disease, tougher than I expected...
9106 2018-08-27 01:40:21 tried softening it with Eucalyptus oil?  rips every thing off glue wise i have found.

9111 2018-08-27 01:39:51 *money shot
9112 2018-08-27 01:39:51 Problem was, even though the zapper would kick the disease down to nothing for a few hours at a time, I seemed to be making no progress.  I was working but not seeing progress.  That's when I added other things in, piece by piece.  The flaxseed oil did the most for me, but...

9118 2018-08-27 01:39:04 My dog has the same thing. It is a skin allergy . Try putting coconut oil in the dog food. It helps. Also ask the vey about apoquel. It help with allergies  and skin irritations. .

If you think oil is required but for 1%,
you have been suckered.

9131 2018-08-27 01:36:47 honestly always praying it’s just oil, coolant, brake fluid, steering fluid, or some other type of liquid

9134 2018-08-27 01:36:24 Read 'The Making of Donald Trump' by David Day Johnston. Trump comes from a long line of snake oil salesmen. He was a major jerk even as a kid.
9135 2018-08-27 01:36:18 So you are part of those who still believe oil price is still low?  Did you know what the oil price is now some months ago?  This govt won't broadcast it, when the oil price is low that's when we will hear them talking. 

Aren't you tired of the same propaganda ?
9136 2018-08-27 01:36:12 You don’t know the cost of the oil

9141 2018-08-27 01:35:26 When I look up Chinese food recipes I’m always disappointed with the simplicity of them. Lol.  It be like sugar, soy sauce; cornstarch.  Hoisin, lobster sauce, corn starch, seasame oil.  Too easy
9142 2018-08-27 01:35:14 They cook a lot of different foods in fryers. If the oil isn’t clean or fresh, that could be part of the problem. If I can make a suggestion, skip the fries. Get mashed potatoes instead. Hope this helps!! Feel better!! 
9143 2018-08-27 01:35:05 had a bad experience with a dry oil last year and now i’m too scared to use another skincare oil which is basically also how i feel about dating men
9144 2018-08-27 01:35:00 And add a few drops of essential oil. Tea tree is great because it's antibacterial, but orange or lavender work well for scent. It has to be stored in a glass spray bottle. Vitamin Shoppe has em cheap
9145 2018-08-27 01:34:48 We are rich in natural resources, grazing, timber, and mining! Oil and gas coal,! These require backing off nmdeq the federal epa is already backing off! Forest Service and BLM must re work their carrying capacities. Stop burning grass and timber!
9146 2018-08-27 01:34:47 Praising McCain or damn near any nutjob in our government is like praising SS officials from the Third Reich. The amount of damage, displacement and death our government has caused people all over the world for oil, for land, for whatever. Praising him tells me all I need to know
9147 2018-08-27 01:34:39 Lmaoo when my car wouldn’t stop beeping and you were like “it probably needs oil”
9148 2018-08-27 01:34:38 To be honest, I totally get it. It works insofar as you believe it works. That is the great thing about placebos—whether it’s a sugar pill, essential oil or a little olive oil and some magic words.
9149 2018-08-27 01:34:32 Sheikh mind ur business without oil u Arabs use 2 ride on a camel & donkeys time is not far when u do the same
9150 2018-08-27 01:34:06 I like both but bud I find is what I like. Oil or hash is high focus, just not giggles n stuff ya get from bud. With bud, I get the euphoric high, as with dabs, I'm just high
9151 2018-08-27 01:33:34 Hell, at this point they might as well.
9152 2018-08-27 01:32:55 I have wanted to try the #CBD oil but every time I mention it, some one always has a negative about it. Then people say depends on the company making it, some do not put as much in as others. I will go back and listen to the podcast...maybe I will get some solid answers.
9153 2018-08-27 01:32:24 B4 pot was legalized, the med marijuana dispensaries sold hash & oil. But the war in Afghanistan messed up the supply of hash to the US & likely to the world. Hash is the resin on the female pot plants with potent content of THC.preferred.Sold in chunk-like cubes &smoked in apipe
9154 2018-08-27 01:32:20 Incredible!!!!  Can I put some coconut oil on you????(lol)
9155 2018-08-27 01:32:12 There’s also the issue of Rosneft, the Russian owned oil and gas co. who sold a large share to a mysterious buyer (turned out to be Glencore) who decided they couldn’t keep it so the Qataris have stepped in, the same Qatari’s who are bailing out Jared Kushners 666 building in NY.

9160 2018-08-27 01:30:52 I rub cannabis oil on my chest to help with the tension and take nerve tonic. Also use heating pads and ice packs.
9161 2018-08-27 01:30:41 As long as nations are willing to buy American weapons they will be sold. Oil is another matter which I'm not familiar with.

9166 2018-08-27 01:30:23 @BraveTart curious if I can substitute equal weight of butter for coconut oil in snickerdoodles? Friend is allergic to coconut. Wondering if that’s a safe substitution.
9167 2018-08-27 01:30:19 I think she said it was Olive Oil.
9168 2018-08-27 01:30:04 Haha 
Aaj tak japani oil suna tha
Ye kya hai??
9169 2018-08-27 01:29:41 I would love to pat you on the back Thomas and say, genius..... however, it’s just common sense. something a certain percentage of the population seems not to possess.  and I just wasted five minutes of my life stating the obvious. What do we do with them?take back the schools!
9170 2018-08-27 01:29:33 If oil and water do not mix, surely being messy and anointed will not either....

9172 2018-08-27 01:29:00 They wanted to shake up the system like he claimed he would have.  He sold them promises he could never deliver for did he care to. He is a snake oil salesman, always has been. Failed businesses left and right. He is a poor man's idea or what a rich man is.  White trash period
9173 2018-08-27 01:28:59 It's not just about teaching history of oil, it's also removing climate change from curricular. And not just schools, EPA has been directed to not use the phrases like "climate change" or "global warming". Scientists working on it has been demoted, some even resigned.
9174 2018-08-27 01:28:53 You've had oil? Be it honey or just plain hippie oil right?
And you've had hash right?
9175 2018-08-27 01:28:38 I would have a magnificent beard like that (albeit grey) if I had a tremendous beard oil, but I can't find one that keeps mine from going Grizzly Adams in the fourth week.  :P
9176 2018-08-27 01:28:35 Plus get new keys cut, your skates sharped, buy lawn furniture, a tent, a vacuum, paint for your house, and get an oil change.

9178 2018-08-27 01:27:32 Have you tried magnesium oil spray? I made some cuz of my cousin's suggestion and I don't have to reapply at all. Once a day works even when I sweat a lot
9179 2018-08-27 01:27:30 Oh Arab !! why don’t you stop the #Oil supply in the favor of #protest against the culprits like #holland ?? 
What will you say ?
when your Allah ask you ?
“what did you do to stop audacious blaspheme act of Holland”
#Jihaad is impossible but protest is not !
#StopOilSupply #Arab
9180 2018-08-27 01:27:29 oh HELL no.  HELL NO.
Time's UP for the oil companies.
No wall, or levee, can be built fast enough and extend high enough that Mother Nature and the rising acidic ocean won't overtake. Throw in a few hurricanes --game over.
Move those effing refineries, produce more wind/solar.

9186 2018-08-27 01:25:35 Takes way longer than an evening to season it right! Do the fish oil 7 later layering thing - it’s amazing.
9187 2018-08-27 01:25:15 All ya need is a press or curling iron, 1 gram pressed, would give ya about 3 weeks of fans easy. It's easy to make bro. It's if you prefer oil high over bud high. That's the difference lol

9192 2018-08-27 01:22:51 Really?
Any serious daily study of Brit dailies in recent years has shown Brits struggling to keep up "big government" - forced to choose between military and welfare state as oil prices collapsed.
9193 2018-08-27 01:22:42 Wish twitter was around when Anna Nicole Smith got married to the oil tycoon. That would’ve been 
9194 2018-08-27 01:22:41 I just doubt @funder’s access is all. “He heard” is right up #teampillowforts lane. I hear a lot of stuff too and I have far more access than he does. And I don’t tweet it. Beware of snake oil.

An awesome concept
9212 2018-08-27 01:18:39 too much association chokes the fire of love, and in absence too long continued, its flame dies from lack of oil.

9214 2018-08-27 01:18:24 Fun fact, in the 70's my dad a coast guard attorney helped write regulations requiring supertankers to have double hulls to avoid oil spills and the oil companies and the Republicans fought tooth and nail because it would have literally added pennies to the gallon of gas.
9215 2018-08-27 01:18:07 Oh, so its when they refine it w butane and make the oil etc. Just never heard it called that before. Thanks for the clarification Brah! Love yer buns! #badradio #theshakejoint
9216 2018-08-27 01:18:04 It never was! May be the one she tested was a contaminated one . There are many used it for 1000s of years and still and all were good. Don’t mix the fast food affect over coconut oil please.
9217 2018-08-27 01:18:01 Have you tried Sunday Riley UFO oil? It’s pricey, but so worth it. It calms my breakouts within a day or two, three max. I use it nightly to prevent, but you can use it twice a day. I’m dry and it can supposedly cause excess dryness, but I’ve never experienced that.

9225 2018-08-27 01:16:35 Venezuela's only having the problems that all export-driven oil economies have been having to some degree.  World commodity price collapsed for their one "crop."

9230 2018-08-27 01:15:43 Which oil Japanese?
9231 2018-08-27 01:15:43 I love different ways to cook things....I am a FOODIE and a kitchen gadget and appliance lover...I’ve been trying the air fryer, it cuts cooking time in and needs a tablespoon of oil spray...
9232 2018-08-27 01:15:34 Big oil has turned enough profits to be able to afford to build that protection they so desire.
9233 2018-08-27 01:15:32 Cooking your stake in ANY oil is ridiculous. Steak has to be cooked in open flame or simply on a good pan, absolutely no oil needed!
9234 2018-08-27 01:14:44 My kids & I'd use the cannabis oil too. I don't see where the problem it. The side effects of these pharm drugs r kills kids & adults daily. Cannabis has not killed ONE. The MAN-MADE fake synthetic "stuff"...has the deadly side effects.  Not the all natural.  much love
9235 2018-08-27 01:14:19 IMO, better to eat fish oil in its natural setting. Salmon.

9242 2018-08-27 01:13:10 Any oil but I’ve been using lavender with black seed oil.
9243 2018-08-27 01:12:50 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.

9254 2018-08-27 01:10:51 Agree, though she is not innocent in this. They are just oil and water and need to be away from each other.
9255 2018-08-27 01:10:51 You do realize the President has very little control over the global price of oil, and therefore the local price of gasoline? It's based on supply and demand.
9256 2018-08-27 01:10:44 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.

9259 2018-08-27 01:09:35 Mike likes our fryer too much. It drains the oil into a plastic storage container to reuse.

9264 2018-08-27 01:08:43 Yes you've made it very clear that you are victim blaming.
Perhaps Maduro asked the countries to sell oil at a loss to decimate other countries.
Your logic that others weathered the storm better only reinforces the victim blaming.
9265 2018-08-27 01:08:33 I was hungover in bed all day and I woke up and my dad changed my oil, washed my car, and filled up my tank:’) I’m crying

9286 2018-08-27 01:05:03 As the eminent @georgegalloway told the U.S. senate: "I have never seen a barrel of oil, owned one, bought one, sold one and neither has anyone on my behalf."... nevertheless, fossil fuels are far more insidious than how we get around. The pipelines are a good start.

9297 2018-08-27 01:04:21 Additional n3 cannot compensate for grossly excessive n6 consumption driven primary by  industrial refined seed oils and margarine. Minimizing dietary seed oils is likey to be far more effective than consumption of likely rancid fish oil capsules...

9311 2018-08-27 01:01:26 Yup. Sounds about right. It’s a great gig (if you can get it) but “ambivalence” is the kindest feeling I can muster most days. Other days, “peddling snake oil” fits my mood more.  (good luck though!)

9313 2018-08-27 01:00:36 I think the key to cooking chicken is to have plenty of moisture (butter, oil, chicken stock, etc). The other option is to seal in the moisture (foil wrap and shake and bake are the easy options).

9423 2018-08-27 00:45:17 PSA: rub olive oil on your knife before cutting an onion, and your eyes won’t water. You’re welcome.
9424 2018-08-27 00:45:03 Ya well we know that there is global economic potential for oil and gas sector as global demand grows that is quantifiable not based on theories and what ifs. Canada could benefit from it without all of the obstructionists within our own country.
9425 2018-08-27 00:44:44 Vesper Woman made a pact with Oil Man and called them a bitch!
9426 2018-08-27 00:44:43 Things were going great today after my dashboard light came on telling me I need a oil change

9433 2018-08-27 00:43:49 New mirror, oil changed, and car washed. Royzell is literally the BEST.
9434 2018-08-27 00:43:21 Alex I’ve been meaning to ask you, your thoughts on the news story calling coconut oil “poison”?
9435 2018-08-27 00:43:00 2 hours since I’ve applied this NARS foundation, and so far I like how it looks on my skin but the oil is starting to come through  trying to see if it’s going to start sliding around or not
9436 2018-08-27 00:42:49 Looking like a oil baron
9437 2018-08-27 00:42:43 Yup, brown lentils. For the potatoes, I used the same fresh thyme, rosemary, and sage (because I had them; I usually use dried herbs for these) I used in the lentils, plus salt, black pepper, and paprika. Coated them in olive oil and in a 400° F oven until they were soft.
9438 2018-08-27 00:42:39 Summers officially over, my coconut oil has solidified
9439 2018-08-27 00:42:37 Big oil like #ExxonMobil pay net 0% federal taxes
They should get that exact amount of proportional help.
9440 2018-08-27 00:42:32 Yet Russia and Iran, both energy exporters sanctioned by the US and others, somehow rode out 2 years of weak oil prices without debasing their currency, mass emigration or becoming the murder capital of the world....
9441 2018-08-27 00:42:09 That sounds plausible but I too was hoping for utter humiliation and a perp walk. I want his and his family's crimes to be proven beyond doubt so his ridiculous followers will see him as the snake oil salesman he truly is.
9442 2018-08-27 00:41:50 sunflower itu agak berat gak sih.. Kamu oily ya?aku saranin cari oil yang lebih ringan.. Kaya jojoba, sama rosehip tapi balik lagi cocok cocokan sih.. Coba aja
9443 2018-08-27 00:41:43 So you’ve *never* thought about any of this deeper than an oil sheen on a mud puddle. You’ve just been blathering on and on, and you’ve never ONCE stopped to deeply consider the views you’re espousing? Really?

9457 2018-08-27 00:40:07 H2 as of today is a dream of oil & gas traditionalists - you need processing, shipping, storaging, distribution... almost like gasoline.
All waste. Solar to H2 and then back to heat and electricity is super low efficiency aka wasting. Making electricity from solar is efficient.
9458 2018-08-27 00:40:02 let’s hope this CBD oil changes my life
9459 2018-08-27 00:40:01 I could tell my mom the oil field and the pipeline are two different things 100 times and she still wouldn’t understand
9460 2018-08-27 00:39:56 Venezuela has the largest known oil reserves. Economy on free fall. The Bolivar exchanges for 10K to the US$ up from 10. Inflation approaching 1,000%. Oil isn't everything. Diversify your revenue and manage your finances well; both country and people @KeTreasury
9461 2018-08-27 00:39:54 revealed: every time The Donald tweets, a sane person prays for help #resist
9462 2018-08-27 00:39:45 Did you see when I said he was a dictator making power grabs? I don't blame everything on oil, but say it was corn. It doesn't matter what it is if your economy relies on it too much. If the dictator didn't do such a poor job, the people wouldn't be in the same position

9466 2018-08-27 00:39:25 .@saveonfoods I refrigerated some of your "Extra Virgin Olive Oil" and was disappointed to find that it didn't semi-solidify the way authentic olive oil should. I know misrepresentation is common in the olive-oil trade, but sorry to find that your firm has been victimized.
9467 2018-08-27 00:39:22 These two are both Artisan water-soluble oil paints, which I'm just starting to learn with. But have used and do still use watercolour and acrylics at times too. All have their good and bad traits, still trying to work out my favourite and right techniques.
9468 2018-08-27 00:39:11 No oil or spices in the skillet?  Just straight up veggies & garlic?

Not criticizing....just asking.
9469 2018-08-27 00:39:10 It's not that they can't sell their oil, it's that they can't produce it! PDVSA failed to invest in well maintenance and all of their qualified personnel have emigrated, leaving only sycophants to staff it!
9470 2018-08-27 00:39:10 It would be easy. Venezuela has so much oil.

9476 2018-08-27 00:37:40 Spent all day trying to get a a stupid bolt out of the oil pickup tube. How?

Using a mirror, a flashlight, a 10mm wrench.

I have it loose, but can't reach it with my fingers, and any tool I put on it makes it spin the other way.
9477 2018-08-27 00:37:37 Have yall thought about adding coconut oil or slight flavor to any future blends? Would be pretty delicious @kings_coast

9479 2018-08-27 00:37:19 Yet other oil dependent countries on the US's naughty step, such as Iran and Russia, successfully implemented policies to ride out the low oil price. Venezuela is a study in epic mismanagement of resources.

9565 2018-08-27 00:20:22 -Take care of your hair when you have protective styles. Get a spray bottle and spray your scalp with water then oil your scalp with whatever oil you use to seal in that moisture. I promise moisturizing can help with hair growth
9566 2018-08-27 00:20:12 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy

9568 2018-08-27 00:19:33 Do you have bike chain oil on the inside of the right pant leg? If the jumpsuit is black, wear another day, if pink, time may be up.
9569 2018-08-27 00:19:10 You know what, a humidifier that throws steam along with that diffuser and oil should make a good effect too.

9571 2018-08-27 00:18:59 2 winters ago I was an excommunicated LDS Mormon in a new area with a violent flu going around. Everyone in my family caught it. I had 1 last drop of oil, yet didn’t run out while blessing all 8 of them. The flu left them the moment the anointing was sealed. Blessings work.
9572 2018-08-27 00:18:56 i am drinking a moscow mule, baking brownies, and i just applied some nail oil so truly i am thriving in this time of virgo stress
9573 2018-08-27 00:18:56 How many times do we need to ask to send you some beard oil, my liege?

On aside $CM is holding $HCG toxic debt. Soldout   interests as to not cause panic by making a deal with buffet who has maritime oil interests; wants Alberta pipeline to delay. Circumstantial but in effect Trudeau protect only his constiuency; banks.
9575 2018-08-27 00:18:25 Routine macam i kena buat like double cleansing, toner, essense/lotion like hada labo tu, serum, masker, moisturiser & sunblock + gel/oil for scar mesti kena ada.

9579 2018-08-27 00:17:51 Not that simple.  Some of the cream that is being sold to you is nothing more than snake oil.
9580 2018-08-27 00:17:46 the secret to soft feet is vitamin e oil.
9581 2018-08-27 00:17:29 For my thick ladies who get chub rub: vaseline and coconut oil after ur shower works wondersss
9582 2018-08-27 00:17:29 Retarded comparison- it’s obvious you like to mix oil with water.
9583 2018-08-27 00:17:22 You mean fill it up partway and put a bit of oil on the gasket?
9584 2018-08-27 00:17:14 1140 mg of Sodium. I'm not allergic to peanuts, but it's cooked in peanut oil?

9586 2018-08-27 00:16:59 And pharma, and banking, and oil & gas, and insurance & finance. And, most especially, religion.
9587 2018-08-27 00:16:57 Chinese food and House Party. This is my night. I’m gonna moisturize and braid my hair. Take me a hot bath and oil myself down and enjoy my Sunday.
9588 2018-08-27 00:16:54 Coconut oil is not for everyone shir doesnt go well with my hair
9589 2018-08-27 00:16:54 Y las leyes antimonopolio terminaron haciendo más rico a Rockefeller de lo que era antes de la disolución de la Standard Oil. Esa historia es interesante.
9590 2018-08-27 00:16:18 -Moisturize your hair. Your hair needs water just like you do. Give her some water every 2days. Especially for my low porosity girls. Using oils to oil your scalp is NOT moisturizing your hair. You can use a leave in conditioner or just use water
9591 2018-08-27 00:16:03 Stick to selling snake oil. Everyone knows about the dog shagging you got up to in Sheffield 
9592 2018-08-27 00:16:01 @JeffreeStar Had a girl test some highlighters on me at MAC and not only do I look like a damn oil puddle she literally said “jeffree star who”.

9594 2018-08-27 00:15:38 What do you think of that "coconut oil is pure poison" stuff that happened recently? Lol
9595 2018-08-27 00:15:27 Haha... I tried getting an oil change a while back when I had a convertible BMW 325i at some mom and pop shop, and they forgot to put on a new washer with the drain plug.  Oil leaking all the way and back to their shop.
9596 2018-08-27 00:15:12 Me, putting oil in my car: somebody order a butch lesbian?
9597 2018-08-27 00:15:02 Wrong. I've never met an oil wrestler in my life.
9598 2018-08-27 00:14:45 FUCK @PSG_English @PSG_espanol  and their fucking oil money ruining the beautiful game.
9599 2018-08-27 00:13:46 Unchaining wages from productivity and allowing for rampant political bribery probably didn't help. My dad's a mechanic. I'm useless at it, beyond changing tires, oil, etc. Then again, he can't build a computer to save his life and I can. Different times, indeed.

9601 2018-08-27 00:13:33 I am over this Texas Heat! Got overheated changing the oil on the mustang and the truck this afternoon and almost passed out. Scary!
9602 2018-08-27 00:13:26 He's a nasty, vindictive man right to the end.  he has all the class of a 3rd rate snake oil salesman at a low-rent carnival.  Sad.
9603 2018-08-27 00:13:19 The liberals will say,  leave the oil alone. Let the people starve.
9604 2018-08-27 00:13:08 Try olive oil
9605 2018-08-27 00:13:03 Great morning to you. For your budget we have two options 
• 3ml (100% Oil) or 
• 10ml EDP (35% Oil)
9606 2018-08-27 00:12:53 “All bitches do is oil they dry ass scalp and let they phone die”
9607 2018-08-27 00:12:45 What if they forget to put the oil in or forget the drain plug?
9608 2018-08-27 00:12:30 The general public thinks Furries are low-life degenerates but I just met a normie who confessed to dipping puppies in motor oil to cure them of mange in front of a Vetrenarian.

Yes it's an old-wives' tale but it's also cruel as shit. Rethink your prejudices. You ain't special.
9609 2018-08-27 00:12:24 Socialism didn't ruin Venezuela, Maduro being in charge did. Oil sales is 50% of their GDP, and when the price of oil dropped nearly 300%. Instead of cutting back on spending, he just printed more money which resulted in massive inflation.
9610 2018-08-27 00:12:00 Hunting for oil cleanser recommendations! I have used up the several bottles of my beloved Kose Softymo Deep that I stocked up on when I was in Singapore in December. Halp.

9615 2018-08-27 00:10:55 It’s on my list of throw always, l actually thgt l heard of just abt every snake oil out there, but ths 1 takes the award!
9616 2018-08-27 00:10:49 Try apply it on damp hair. I always spray some water on my edges first then go in with an oil before I apply the gel.
9617 2018-08-27 00:10:45 My mother-in-law just replied to a text I sent with, “Yep. Squeaky wheel gets the oil” and if that’s not the most Southern Mother thing to say, I don’t know what is.
9618 2018-08-27 00:10:38 Having to use dollars to buy the most important commodity in the world from OPEC requires other countries to use our money.  It enabled us to inflate our money and the rest of the world is forced to still use the dollar to buy Oil.  If they change that all those dollars come back
9619 2018-08-27 00:10:34 Sounds as tho a good dose of strap oil applied immediately might cure that attitude!!!!!
9620 2018-08-27 00:10:27 I went to San Diego this April, saw the Dodgers play the Padres but when I came home things were missing and different food was in the refrigerator. Today I changed the oil on “Marilyn” my 2004 Beetle; almost put dirty oil in it as someone also put dirty oil in my garage.

9624 2018-08-27 00:10:13 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
9625 2018-08-27 00:10:13 EU creó leyes anti monopolio una vez que se dió cuenta que la Standard Oil había adquirido por años a empresas competencias, junto a la vías férreas por un tiempo esos dos grandes establecieron el monopolio de comercialización del Kerosene, es parte de la Historia!
9626 2018-08-27 00:10:11 I still can’t fathom some paradox of life. Why is Venezuela, the largest oil producing country (and country with the largest oil reserve) in the world on the brink of survival?

I find it odd that blessed countries (natural resources)are the ones mostly struggling to survive.
9627 2018-08-27 00:09:54 #AlaskaPermanentFund was made in 1976 funded by oil revenue. AK residents who live there a year get a dividend, from $331 in 1984 to $2072 in 2015. In 2008 Gov #SarahPalin gave extra payment of $1200. Since '96 it's been $1K+ in 19/23 years. Ask Palin how well #socialism works.
9628 2018-08-27 00:09:49 To clarify, Clinton & Obama gave Al Qaida weapons to transfer over the Libyan border into Syria so they could destabilize Syria & take control of its oil.  Qaddafi of Libya was eliminated early to get him out of the way.  He was friends w/ Amb Stevens so they both knew too much.
9629 2018-08-27 00:09:47 China, has been taking steps to challenge the greenback's dominance with the launch of an oil futures contract backed by Chinese currency, the petro-yuan. #China and #Iran have already agreed to stop using the dollar in global trade  in defiance of US sanctions.

9634 2018-08-27 00:08:42 Well they plan to get rid of the carbon tax, close the loophole to border crossers, stop people from coming here to give birth as a way to    get citizenship. They are for getting our oil to tidewater and energy independence. They have strong people in the HoC.

9636 2018-08-27 00:07:15 Except for his base - who have a cumulative IQ about the same as their age - normal people who voted Rep.are waking up to this snake oil salesman & if The Senate doesn't impeach him via Emoluments violations or Mueller's report, he is going to go down in an avalanche in 2020.

9645 2018-08-27 00:06:20 Useless Nuclear pact, unverified Nuclear pact, uninspected Nuclear pact. Frozen Assets? Money from leverage oil deals. Frozen for violation of International trade laws.

9661 2018-08-27 00:04:21 Was in a chippy earlier in Anstruther, popular so they ask your order while your in the queue, teenage girl says she’s vegan and asks if there is any fish or meat fried in the same oil as the chips, waitress replies yes and the girl says ‘okay that’s fine, I’ll have the chips’?
9662 2018-08-27 00:04:18 Neil, along with things like hair, skin, and nails supplements, I use flackseed oil (in a capsule) and Biotin. Both are available in the pharmacy. They help hair and nails.  I got sick in 2013 and most of my hair fell out. Grew back strong and helped my nails a lot. Good luck
9663 2018-08-27 00:04:16 I can't think of a single big industry that's been particularly proactive or even responsive when it comes to big picture consequences. Auto, oil, health, defense education all come to mind.
9664 2018-08-27 00:04:04 Thanks to the President you won't back. During Obama had nothing. Now with deregulation by President Trump the money is flowing just like the gas and oil.

9673 2018-08-27 00:02:32 Thanks to President Trump deregulaing the oil and gas industry. We have had the oil and gas for ever but it was President Trump who deregulated the industry. Leading to the surplus you are trying to claim. 550 million last year and 1.2 billionth is year.
9674 2018-08-27 00:02:31 Who called it snake oil and not Johnny Three-Swords.
9675 2018-08-27 00:02:15 Heat up the oil in the pan then put the dumplings into a hot pan & let them cook while you go get the water measured out, pour water into pan, cover, & JUST DON'T TOUCH it for 8 min or whatever the cooking time is. If there's still liquid at the end let it cook off. +
