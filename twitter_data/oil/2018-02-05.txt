2 2018-02-05 23:59:18 Right on!  I went into a dealership for a gasket & o-ring today.  Told the young man at the parts counter that I am doing an oil change on my bike and just learned how to replace the carb.  His comment:  "Very cool!  It's fun, isn't it?"  Yay!  Attitudes do change.  
3 2018-02-05 23:58:41 I lie in bed at night on my wedge pillows and heating pad with my emu oil and Vicks Vapo-rub on, in a thick humidifier fog. I gotta big nasal strip on. And I wonder: why doesn’t a hot chick like me get asked out more often?

5 2018-02-05 23:57:36 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store.
6 2018-02-05 23:57:18 I smell one questionable thing in my house and I light every candle, turn on every wax melt, every oil diffuser, spray all the febreeze, and make sure all my wallflowers are full.
7 2018-02-05 23:57:07 You are conviently missing out the word Class?

If the nice feminists wi the nice shares want to go fight to nick another nation's oil, THEY should go do it.

They won't.

They'll wound up working class wumin, just like they do working class men
8 2018-02-05 23:57:06 wow I love oil paint. Painting for 3 hours and having very little to show of it

12 2018-02-05 23:56:17 Today a semi had an oil leak that sprayed all over the windshield of my car and I couldn't see on the freeway for like a half mile so that was fine
13 2018-02-05 23:56:09 Nice oil lamps!
14 2018-02-05 23:55:50 I wanna try their face oil and more lip whips. I have two that I bought like a year ago.
15 2018-02-05 23:55:48 All I asked for was a list of ALL their products with a statement as to whether they have palm oil. After sifting through the statements, I guess this is their ONLY product that is palm oil free. So the answer is ALL their products have palm oil except for one.

32 2018-02-05 23:55:40 Oh I know.  I use bath oils!!  Even baby oil works.  Put some in a warm bath and soak a bit.
33 2018-02-05 23:54:56 It's like you knew my "oil change needed" indicator came on today.
34 2018-02-05 23:54:43 @elrufai2015, government should revive our Refinery for cheap oil
35 2018-02-05 23:54:42 i remembered how i found titty oil on aliexpress and my ungrateful c-cup ass was about to buy it
36 2018-02-05 23:54:38 What is the logo under Mullins Racing on the B Pilar?
37 2018-02-05 23:54:21 Cam, do you put oil in your pasta water too?
38 2018-02-05 23:54:13 I really need get over my D.A.R.E. brainwashing at look into CBD oil for my pain. I'm on a low amount of opiates, for me, but it doesn't really cut it. My GI tract does not appreciate me taking NSAIDS to try and keep pain down. #chronicpain #Fibromyalgia #endometriosis #Crohns
39 2018-02-05 23:54:06 She requests catnip and coconut oil :-D
40 2018-02-05 23:54:05 Don’t even know what that is, we were told coconut oil but that didn’t work, have super soft n smooth bald bits though 
41 2018-02-05 23:54:04 Seth's reading comprehension skills are excellent. So are his acting skills. Currently he is playing the role of a old time charlatan and snake oil salesman. Making money off his mindless followers. Its an old game...
42 2018-02-05 23:53:53 @Tranmere_Trust how about reaching out to @BeavertownBeer to sponsor the fan zone for the rest of season, only 7 games to go. Promotion could be fuelled by Gamma Ray & Neck Oil  #NonLeague #passionnotfashion
43 2018-02-05 23:53:47 You should try my hair gold. It has castor oil in it as well as other great oils for hair growth.
44 2018-02-05 23:53:44 ซีลูกแม่ เจ็บมากมั้ยลูกกกกก  #ดิวเด๋อ
45 2018-02-05 23:53:25 Wa pud oil hahahahaha yawa
46 2018-02-05 23:53:22 Canada isnt exactly the most attractive place for investors to put their money and what you are proposing would make it less attractive. Do you honestly think that gov could pay off voters with oil money and remain in power but they dont because oil co tell them not to lol
47 2018-02-05 23:53:02 Jobs? Possible short-term employment in face of ecological devastation is unethical and unsustainable. BC does not want Alberta's toxic tar sands oil. In fact, no one on Earth wants access to this harmful fuel. Embrace reality - transition to a green economy!
48 2018-02-05 23:53:00 Costa was no oil painting
49 2018-02-05 23:52:43 Oil price keeps on INCREASING, hey! Govt officials why are you not WORRYING.
50 2018-02-05 23:52:11 Yes, & what plausible motive would Putin have w/ Trump vs Obama/HRC? He traded sanctions for Crimea. His military back in Syria/ME. Billions $ cash shipped to trading partner, Iran. Ukraine not in NATO. No missiles to Poland.  Limited US oil exports. All wins for Putin!
51 2018-02-05 23:52:06 ねむねむで現実と夢をいったりきたり
52 2018-02-05 23:52:00 So I had another elderly patient call my office today and ask me about “marijuana oil” for her pain. Lmao  guys I wish I was at liberty to tell patients what’s REALLY on my mind. 
53 2018-02-05 23:51:59 Melissa: Go get your oil changed
Katie: Do I have to tell them how much oil I want?

54 2018-02-05 23:51:55 The only one I like other than the regular black one is the coconut oil one.
55 2018-02-05 23:51:53 OH and the 30% of land they plan to steal for 'Rojava' JUST SO happens to be in the oil rich areas of Syria...
56 2018-02-05 23:51:44 Fish oil pills are legit
57 2018-02-05 23:51:43 Page was in the top 10% of his class at USNA, got a Masters in Security Studies from Georgetown, was a Navy Intelligence Officer at the UN, got an MBA from NYU, became a VP at Merrill Lynch, got a PhD from the Univ. of London, & *reportedly* made $610M in the Russian oil business
58 2018-02-05 23:51:25 Wonderful sentiments..., Don't get me wrong many  Albeit not when it's at the expense of multi-National corporate profits (greed)! - Banking & Oil Moguls v's new energy (zero-point & anti-gravidic - US Pentagon - USAP's)
59 2018-02-05 23:51:16 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
60 2018-02-05 23:51:07 Poke a couple of holes. Lightly coat in oil. Wrap in foil, Bake for roughly an hour. Serve hot w/ butter. You might overcook them a little, but they're really forgiving. An hour is a rough estimate, cook longer for big ones and shorter for small ones.
61 2018-02-05 23:50:56 I believe Sekera will bounce back next year with a full off-season to train. The Oilers are not in a position to lose him.
62 2018-02-05 23:50:46 I Sip Oil & Laugh At Da Lame Shit No Cap
63 2018-02-05 23:50:45 Pro tip: triple your dosage of pre- and probiotics before heading to the airport.  Prepare your immune system for war.  And rub vaseline on your nostrils.  And carry a handkerchief dabbed with peppermint oil to mask the foul human scent. 

OR JUST STAY HOME
64 2018-02-05 23:50:27 Which Jamaican black castor oil should I be buying ?
65 2018-02-05 23:50:17 if you think your economy only hangs on oil, and pipelines then I think u must lack intelligence and/or imagination. BC is NOT targeting Alberta jobs, we're doing our best to preserve our environment for future generations from you! #ableg #cdnpoli #bcpoli
66 2018-02-05 23:50:15 also, did you know a nuclear power plant disaster is as bad as an oil pipeline spill? The more you know....???
67 2018-02-05 23:50:08 He's expressing the pain of MOST Americans. The 30%er's are the only buying your Russian snake oil.
68 2018-02-05 23:50:06 Good idea to hurry before Trumpler destroys the solar industry on behalf of his oil industry overlords
69 2018-02-05 23:50:05 I got arrested, they found a zip of weed oil, and literally the only thing the cop kept saying is “who’s car is this” “youuuu bought this car?” Even had to ask me to spell my full name out just to make sure it matched the registration and then let me go lol wtf kept the oil tho
70 2018-02-05 23:49:54 I just told you why you cant squeeze the oil companies for much more than we are now without driving away work and putting people out of work.
71 2018-02-05 23:49:42 @iam_Davido you besides #Oil you are one @Nigeria 's greatest exports..Your presence on the global stage continues to open doors of opportunities for up coming acts in #Nigeria to be able to have a foot hold on the global stage..
72 2018-02-05 23:49:34 The UK share is from the tax on Shell & BP profits. Can't have them making money on North Sea oil, when they can pay corporation tax in the UK instead that ends up being in WM pocket instead of Scotland.
73 2018-02-05 23:49:24 Comes with free bottle of snake oil!
74 2018-02-05 23:49:11 A small price to pay from handouts in comparison to how London has boomed and millionaires made on the back of oil and gas revenues from Scotland.
75 2018-02-05 23:49:06 Like the oilly

76 2018-02-05 23:49:03 I spend too much money on hair products. Moroccan oil, why you have to be so expensive?
77 2018-02-05 23:48:57 Banyak perempuan buat thread skin care, aku rasa nak promote pulak bio essence hyra tri action dengan dr. Wu. Dedua ada hylalolaloruoraranic acid sesuai untuk dehydrated skin yang ada excessive oil. Lembut ja muka macam bontot bayi
78 2018-02-05 23:48:56 I remember why i don't eat at kfc that often ugh.  the new bbq chicken strips taste like they dipped them in bbq potato chip powder mixed with vegetable oil
79 2018-02-05 23:48:56 Seeing as my team lost the SB, I was able to spend my Championship Merch $ on car parts. New front pads & rotors, oil change, & cabin air filter change.
80 2018-02-05 23:48:35 I agree about the price! I'm a big butter fan. Not too big on the 'soft' butter though; that tends to be half canola oil.
81 2018-02-05 23:48:31 That has nothing to do with how fast he moves from post to post.
82 2018-02-05 23:48:28 I need to do a hot oil treatment on my hair. But I don’t feel like it
83 2018-02-05 23:48:27 Wake up #MAGA  and do the right thing and stop believing the crap #Trump is selling.....#trump is nothing more than a  snake oil salesmen!!!!
84 2018-02-05 23:48:22 Ha ha I am obsessed with buying beard oil for boyfriend
85 2018-02-05 23:48:12 In my world, decent people don't authorize torture, start oil wars based on lies, and set reproductive rights back around the world. 

I don't care how well-mannered they are.
86 2018-02-05 23:48:05 Perlu basic skincare aja kalo males kek cleansing oil, fw, toner, moisturizer, sunscreen.
87 2018-02-05 23:47:50 Hopefully in my second life I'm bored into a family with oil money
88 2018-02-05 23:47:13 2014 i think then the price of oil tanked.
89 2018-02-05 23:47:03 "It smells like cardamom oil." -Jess
90 2018-02-05 23:46:50 weeeellll, IMHO anything else not including nuclear war and drilling for oil off the coast
91 2018-02-05 23:46:50 OK Matey BARRIERS So that will be; To French, German, Italian and Spanish wines, French, Dutch Cheese, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German Cars, Spanish and Italian Olive Oil...how long a list do you want @MichelBarnier you dope !
92 2018-02-05 23:46:33 I also think someone will overpay for Green. Right D men are in high demand - I don't want us to be the overpayers. I think Green is great, but I feel like someone will pay him too much. Also who takes Sekera without seeing at least the first quarter of next season?
93 2018-02-05 23:46:32 Crob may have spilt hot oil all over our legs but I’ve never laughed so much
94 2018-02-05 23:46:29 He says I’m the coconut oil queen cuz I use it for everything lol
95 2018-02-05 23:46:29 ああ紫を感じる・・・
しかし供養してないような気がするがグッジョブだ。流石東北のブレーン
96 2018-02-05 23:46:26 The destruction of native forests to harvest palm oil in SE Asia is killing off orangutans & other animals.
97 2018-02-05 23:46:26 "Bakit ang rich kid mo?"

My face is one of the world's largest oil reserves.
98 2018-02-05 23:46:20 Then try coconut oil and/or aloevera gel
99 2018-02-05 23:46:18 My skin smells like roses from my homemade rose infused oil & I’m soooooo soft!
100 2018-02-05 23:46:16 i can't believe i thought of the olive oil from my chicken salad leaking only for it to really happen when i checked my bag ffs
101 2018-02-05 23:45:50 Lead me to salvation, pour that oil please.
102 2018-02-05 23:45:38 THIS IS THE TRUTH ABOUT COCONUT OIL!!!!
103 2018-02-05 23:45:33 If you’re a man, also consider marrying the girl before ‘smashing’ her unprotected
104 2018-02-05 23:45:22 I have a very large pot suitable for hot tar or boiling oil, or a seafood gumbo.
105 2018-02-05 23:45:21 Well it's not like we didn't do it to ourselves. Canadian politicians love their taxes. And then the stupid fuckers are puzzled when big business bails & goes home. Hey btw, want to adopt Alberta. We have lots of oil and nobody wants it. Lol.
106 2018-02-05 23:45:19 Ladies Tea Tree oil and Witch hazel is your best friend ..  keep clean and fresh !
107 2018-02-05 23:45:04 MOTHER: Have some more. You hardly touched anything. Did Tommy tell you about my painting? Look at this.
(Pulls out an oil painting from alongside the refrigerator.)

JIMMY: It's beautiful.

TOMMY: I like this one. One dog goes one way and the other goes the other.
108 2018-02-05 23:44:58 I hope they get what (we the people) want,We couldn't afford the clean up after a hurricane,how could we clean up an oil spill! The office 4-100 mls,Ga. should pay more attention to Brunswick . The coast would look much better.
109 2018-02-05 23:44:44 Oil is part of that free trade relationship, so Albertans should stop buying BC Wine ( and other products and services until the BD NDP/Green gov't starts acting like they are a member of a Free Trade relationship
110 2018-02-05 23:44:42 Agreed, but it doesn’t have to end up in landfill. There are systems running now around the world turning plastic garbage into petrol, diesel, heating oil, building blocks & wall panels, roadfill, long life fence posts ...

 We can use it all.
111 2018-02-05 23:44:38 i got lactic acid and rosehip oil because apparently they both rlly help with acne scarring aka the thing that covers my whole FACE but next time i’m gonna order other stuff but a lot of it was out of stock when i ordered :(
112 2018-02-05 23:43:59 I'm not saying a defenceman like Green wouldn't help, but is he that much of an offensive upgrade on Sekera at this point? Green will be 33 next season. And while it looks like he can play, how many more years is he going to want?
113 2018-02-05 23:43:58 I’m sorry, I know many people that have dealt with rape or a child that ultimately would live in pain upon birth. This isn’t their experience. This is yours, and you made the decision because you had a choice. Don’t put your abnormal experience on others, don’t take their choice
114 2018-02-05 23:43:58 Went to my mechanic for an oil change and he comes back telling me all the shit my car needs  *calls dad*
115 2018-02-05 23:43:55 I found there was nothing that stopped the cracking completely (so disheartening) but coconut oil, 8 hour cream as above, aquarphor, Carmex, blister and Burts Bees Original lip balm all helped to soften!!!
116 2018-02-05 23:43:51 Mr. @RepAdamSchiff was born after his time. He would be that guy with the wagon, pulling into your town selling some snake oil remedy. Taking your money and lying to your face and be comfortable doing it! Sad part is, somebody voted this shyster into office!  
117 2018-02-05 23:43:45 Oil service costs and reduced sweet spots? Sounds like a big jump but shale is a ponzi
118 2018-02-05 23:43:43 WITH THE WAY @BAKAYOKO IS DRAGING #CHELSEA DOWN,WE MIGHT DISCOVER CRUDE OIL AND BURTON ALBION
119 2018-02-05 23:43:35 Instead of the Major Oil Marketers to combine and build they are always complaining the Govt handout isn't enough
120 2018-02-05 23:43:27 The paths of their administrations are littered w unresolved scandals, including the missing Gulf War oil revenues variously put at between $7 billion and $12 billion; d long-running Halliburton scandal; fraudulent oil block sales/allocations, & abandoned projects across d land.

122 2018-02-05 23:43:05 I’m waiting at Jiffy Lube getting an oil change and I JUST SAW A MOUSE IN HERE 
123 2018-02-05 23:42:59 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
124 2018-02-05 23:42:59 Tell you what though...ain’t nothing like driving the Z baby after an oil change 
125 2018-02-05 23:42:47 The Iraq war had way more to do with oil than 9/11. Bush just used the feelings of Americans after the attack to justify that shit. Research that yourself if you wanna be informed,  I don’t have time to be your history teacher.
126 2018-02-05 23:42:45 President Obama was derided for the rising cost of gasoline during his first term (rising oil prices) In O's 2nd term, gas prices dropped--not a peep. #RepublicansSuck
127 2018-02-05 23:41:41 Buy Canadian names levered to condensate (montney and duvernay region) and stay away from heavy oil until an agreement is reached. There is talk of recommissioning an eastern egress pipeline which would be helpful.

129 2018-02-05 23:41:33 I just spent all my birthday money on a car oil change, and filters. I low key hope my future husband knows about cars, that way I can save some money 
130 2018-02-05 23:41:25 . @RurikBradbury #CIcon2018 : #AI is the new snake oil in #chatbots - “This one is better! It has 20% more AI!”
131 2018-02-05 23:41:24 Oh fuck off... The bloody SNP is a merger of Old Scottish Labour and traditional so called tartan tories. Its functioning neoliberalism as a result.
Progressive, fits in nicely into Europe.
Even with the curse of masses of fucking oil & the blessing of austerity

What. Its true
132 2018-02-05 23:41:13 I’ve been so busy today. Got all my W2s. Filed my taxes. Went grocery shopping. Got my oil changed. And now, I just want to drink.
133 2018-02-05 23:41:03 Except when you unfollow for no reason, right Kate?
134 2018-02-05 23:41:03 I agree. The Thatcher years generated unsustainable growth based on oil, financial services and debt, led to the UK diverging from Europe.
135 2018-02-05 23:40:39 Oil prices went way down, people don’t know how to budget, people weren’t prepared, maybe stop living outside your means? Society has lived through this before and found their way. #commonsense
136 2018-02-05 23:40:38 Honestly I used to use the smashbox primer oil everytime I got out of the shower or washed my face and it's amazing
137 2018-02-05 23:40:34 Where are my new CBD Oil users? Tell me how much you are loving it <3
138 2018-02-05 23:40:31 How am I supposed to bake cornbread without cooking oil ?!!!
139 2018-02-05 23:40:24 there is no such thing as sustainable palm oil!!!

141 2018-02-05 23:40:20 The goal is to make pollution into a tangible cost. People making coal and oil based products can invest into making sure they're not putting out emissions, or pass the cost to consumers. This makes it easier for alternative technologies to compete. This isn't rocket science.
142 2018-02-05 23:40:11 ah it was all improvised, i used this leftover ethiopian beet dish i took home from an event & mixed in some black-eyed peas that i'd cooked w/ some seasonings, stirred some herbs into the pounded yam, brushed the top w/ coconut oil & broiled it for the last 10 minutes of baking
143 2018-02-05 23:40:10 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
144 2018-02-05 23:40:02 Youre on the wrong loop... that's indyref1. UK credit rating is on the slide. Imagine Ireland with huge oil reserves to underwrite its economy and our rating will be about there..    you need to retread your arguments. You sound tired.....
145 2018-02-05 23:39:49 It's as if the military industrial complex were run by Jabba the Hut, Mr. Drysdale, Gollum, and King Midas.  Who are these people who will blow up the planet for oil? They are the real terrorists!
146 2018-02-05 23:39:44 Probably not. He is an oil industry consultant and does business with Russia and Asia also.

150 2018-02-05 23:38:45 After watching in person then rewatching the 2018 Lucas Oil chili bowl for the 20th time on @MAVTV on my DVR I’m fairly convinced that @CBellRacing is my favorite midget driver. Dude can flat out drive.
151 2018-02-05 23:38:33 John Mahoney was great in a lot of things, but my favorite under-rated Mahoney perf was an episode of FOYLE'S WAR where he plays a dying oil baron who might have dealt with the Nazis. He brought a Lear-like pathos to the role.

153 2018-02-05 23:37:57 It's not the "Rouhani" policies, he doesn't have much of decision making power and is a puppet of khamenei. It's the unproductive and corrupt system that after 40 years is more dependent on oil than ever and regime adventures are very costly
154 2018-02-05 23:37:41 have u tried coconut oil?.xx
155 2018-02-05 23:37:25 Yes, it does. It’s a couple of trips to a decent restaurant & an oil change here in SF.

164 2018-02-05 23:35:21 I was driving up a hill and it was like "yeah, not doing this" and it turned out that somehow there was no oil in it? Idk how that happened.
165 2018-02-05 23:35:14 4 days until my due date. anybody got any tips besides the castor oil thing I'm ready to go into labor.
166 2018-02-05 23:35:00 Right...we wages war on Venezuela because they nationalized their healthcare, oil, and almost every other private industry. The propaganda has got you by the toes; In a free market economy, sellers sell at a price someone is willing to pay; the government has no role there.
167 2018-02-05 23:34:46 @davidfholt So a REPUBLICAN messed up reduced big oil taxes in OK  and now wants to mess up OKC as mayor?  I need my birth certificate to go the bathroom?

170 2018-02-05 23:34:25 That has nothing to do with oil companies paying the crown to have drilling rights on any land they pay to drill or mine on. Your problem might be more with gov and less with private companies.
171 2018-02-05 23:34:23 Peppermint oil will get rid of it
172 2018-02-05 23:34:19 OIL...  a bit like Brexit... colonialism... apartheid...  trans atlantic slave trade... "OIL... "that shit you can truly believe in", when you've nothing left to blame for your inadequacies  but race and ... oil.

181 2018-02-05 23:32:56 Do you think someone should pay another tax everything’s me they light a cigar, start a campfire, take a child to school? Even in an electric car I would need to get electricity generated and delivered by something made from oil. It’s not going away.
182 2018-02-05 23:32:51 Cooked up some chicken Alfredo with mixed veggies tonight for dinner. Seasoned the chicken with a blend of Italian seasonings, garlic, and parsley, mixed with olive oil and white wine.

It came out exactly as good as it sounds. Mmmmm.

185 2018-02-05 23:31:05 You are what's wrong with Today's Media, you should be the one giving all the facts. You should be ashamed, because you added oil to the current Trump Fire.

197 2018-02-05 23:28:45 @todderic_ you’re starting to get a keloid on your nose ring. You should get tea tree oil and dilute it in water and then put some on a qtip and dab it around. Also salt water. Make sure not to do it too much or it can slow the healing. If it starts getting worse go tothe piercer

205 2018-02-05 23:27:11 Never used that but oil thickens or thins based on temperature if it’s too thick it’ll make your fuel pump work harder. Too thin it doesn’t do its job right. Synthetic also lasts longer

233 2018-02-05 23:22:49 Pag uli nako mag change oil nako
234 2018-02-05 23:22:42 ... if everything that anti-pipeline activists say about crude from the oil sands is true, it goes without saying that it should be boycotted & banned. But the fact is, the core claims are gross exaggerations or downright false. That’s the problem, IMO.

278 2018-02-05 23:16:36 Almost accidentally poured coffee in my essential oil diffuser this morning that’s how my Monday was
279 2018-02-05 23:16:31 General pessimism. Market drop included big oil drops.
280 2018-02-05 23:16:20 Do you support expanding oil drilling off the NC coast? What about expanding fracking in NC? Your constituents would love for you to share your thoughts with them as well.

282 2018-02-05 23:15:27 i’m out here trying to buy a fucking oil pen and no one is PROVIDING. my ex mans hates me now so i can’t go to him when he was my only source... i’m bitter
283 2018-02-05 23:15:25 Alternatively, we've had a ludicrous, unsustainable growth in the past 6-12 months, and also this isn't precipitated by the housing market collapsing or the oil market doubling.
284 2018-02-05 23:15:20 And I'm not saying that Trump is some sort of genius or anything. It's mostly about attitude. The US expends a lot of cash on maintaining world hegemony. Without the USSR or oil dependence, that doesn't make sense to me. Why the fuck am I paying for Americans to die...
285 2018-02-05 23:15:17 That’s happened to me. Putting Vaseline and tea tree oil helped
286 2018-02-05 23:15:15 the coconut & hibiscus shea moisture line. i always add in some drops of jojoba oils in my curling smoothie to seal in moisture & coconut oil hair masks.
287 2018-02-05 23:15:14 these oil pens 
288 2018-02-05 23:15:08 What?! OMG. I would have wanted to be in that stream just to freak the fk out. I heard about this guy who is the son of a rich oil mongral & he was popping up on random streams to donate $50k just because.
289 2018-02-05 23:15:00 Thanks DJT I'm selling off and going to grab some oil super cheap, rebounds in the spring/summer will sell off again for Profits $$$$

293 2018-02-05 23:14:26 We're aware that many practices cause suffering. 

Most vegans are also cutting out palm oil, plastic (inc. polyester), animal testing, electronics, ,  & mica from slave labour etc.

We learn something is unethical & we do our best not to support it. That's kinda the point.

307 2018-02-05 23:13:02 You are right the downturn lost the jobs recently. But if we shut the oil sands down complete as David suggested we are talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs that will make the downturn look like nothing
308 2018-02-05 23:12:59 Its no coincidence that all the "have" provinces in Canada all have an oil and gas sector. Its also no coincidence that the strength of of dollar fluctuates along with fluctuations in global oil prices.

315 2018-02-05 23:12:20 Well, there’s not a real big “climate change is real” lobby. But the oil lobby is enormous. So it would be hard to persuade 97% of the world’s science community into a globe wide conspiracy. 
I didn’t believe in “global warming” at first either. But it’s inexorable.

318 2018-02-05 23:11:18 So we're going to celebrate a man who advocates the armed overthrow of a government in South America because there's oil there?
319 2018-02-05 23:11:16 Bath oil please
320 2018-02-05 23:11:06 But you were just complaining about all the profits they were making and want more of why not just skip the middle man start your own oil company and take in all the profits. Or better yet give most od those profits to the gov.

327 2018-02-05 23:10:31 Well, well, well, so #gridgirls are a necessity after all, they get rid of pretty girls to appease the feminists, but replace them with children.
Yet we have all kinds of children related problems in football, and now we have Arab oil money dictating whom can be involved in F1

329 2018-02-05 23:10:20 Jarrett, with respect, the loss of jobs is thanks to the supply glut, low oil prices, all brought about by the oil industry itself.
330 2018-02-05 23:10:19 Your skin is amazing though. I bet you use pure organic coconut oil. Am I right?
331 2018-02-05 23:10:11 RT @LivingSafely: Cool #Whip this February? Its first three #ingredients are water, hydrogenated oil and High Fructose Corn Syrup!
332 2018-02-05 23:09:58 Hair gel and beard oil?
333 2018-02-05 23:09:44 @gatluke are you also selling a Nigerian Princes’ inheritance or Bonny light crude oil at a deep discount? Both of which are more credible than these claims you just made. Get real son.
334 2018-02-05 23:09:42 Let me put it like this. What if China invaded Mexico and Canada, and  then threatened sanctions for working on EMP delivery systems as a  counter-balance. You think we'd stand for it? It's worth remembering Iran is only where it's at because we overthrew their government for oil
335 2018-02-05 23:09:36 I will try that coconut oil & baking soda for sure. Thanks!
336 2018-02-05 23:09:30 Wow you learn something new everyday . For a fever if you ever have one or know someone who does . Take a small drop of frankincense essential oil on your thumb and put it under the roof of your mouth for 30 seconds . The fever will go away immediately!
337 2018-02-05 23:09:22 If you're going to extract oil, the extraction is the same no matter how you ship it; transportation is a drop in the bucket, but slightly cleaner to use pipelines than trains/trucks. Not fighting against nor for pipelines.
338 2018-02-05 23:08:56 Snake oil sales
339 2018-02-05 23:08:51 Why not just start up your own oil company and take advantage of what you see as unfair advantage given to companies.
340 2018-02-05 23:08:11 Just went on @buttersnsuch website and hmmmm that green tea lavender oil thooooo is kinda speaking to me.
341 2018-02-05 23:08:08 months ago saw a thread about hymns people had to sing at school and, how some of them were favourites.

Someone in the thread talked about one called Give Me Oil In My Lamp, i didn't recognise the title. The melody finally came back to me today.
342 2018-02-05 23:08:02 @GordonRamsay how many litres of olive oil do you reckon Jamie Oliver goes through a week??
343 2018-02-05 23:07:48 Divest from dirty oil and pipeline stocks!
344 2018-02-05 23:07:46 UGH i hate MEN and the fuckin CONDESCENDING ASS conversation I get at car dealerships. I’m just a woman tryna live an independent life and get my damn oil changed
345 2018-02-05 23:07:35 Wish I knew where oil was going from here I'm invested in it so I need it to go up so I can afford to pay my Puerto Rico electric bill
346 2018-02-05 23:07:35 Hemp seed oil is an excellent moisturizer for the skin. It helps reduce the itch & dryness of eczema as it's rich in Omega 3, 6 & 9 fatty acids, has anti-inflammatory properties & penetrates skin making it more elastic. #aromatherapy #atopicdermatitis
347 2018-02-05 23:07:34 Stupid. I guess all that oil would be unsaleable without the EU relationship. They refused to join as they were too rich thanks to oil. Just be leached from.

Normal life is not part of any customs subservience to an Empire. Your slave mentality is the problem. You need a master?
348 2018-02-05 23:07:32 Best not take any more. If you have any lavender oil, put a little on your night-clothes. Sleep well.
349 2018-02-05 23:07:28 Y’all probably assume that my favorite Dial Moisturizing Hand Soap scent is Marula Oil, but you’re wrong. It’s Iced Berries.

352 2018-02-05 23:06:36 Canada represents 5% of world oil exports. They need to step it up to 20%. This is feasible. America, a competitor, is focused on #EnergyDominance, they are not stupid. They understand the enriching value of #FossilFuel exports. Let's put #OPEC out of business.

356 2018-02-05 23:06:03 Castor oil and prayer. But sometimes, if the genes aren’t in support, it’s a fruitless endeavour. 
357 2018-02-05 23:05:45 I changed due to heart condition,pacemaker fitted, around ten years ago,Oil seems to make it worse creosote or jeyes fluid I'm off work a couple of days!changed to oil around 5 or so years ago been a lot better,still use bin & cover stain,occasionally but the aerosols spray & out
358 2018-02-05 23:05:36 Both oil and coal are major pollutants, meanwhile calling a tax on pollution a money grab is simply surreal to me. Meanwhile, one would think you'd be cheering for ending oil subsidies from tax dollars if you care about your $$ so much.
359 2018-02-05 23:05:24 Lice shampoo is harsh and unnecessary if she doesn't have them. I suggest tea tree oil shampoo or a few drops of tea tree oil in her regular shampoo. Also keeping her hair in braids or a tight ponytail and having the 'no hugging/using other brushes' convo. Good luck!
360 2018-02-05 23:05:12 Coconut oil all over my body 
361 2018-02-05 23:05:09 Stewardship?  Like opening up sensitive Alaskan land to oil drilling?

377 2018-02-05 23:03:14 Projection. Lowering tax rates as was attempted in Kansas Under Brownback to try and increase GDP was an unmitigated disaster. I can tell you that from experience and from knowing that Trickle Down Theory is snake oil peddled by widely discredited Economist Arthur Laffer.

416 2018-02-05 22:57:54 I remember back at High school learning that oil would run out &a an alternative was required. Since then we have created more & more waste!
417 2018-02-05 22:57:51 He actually knows nothing.  And he's just a snake oil salesman also, nothing more.  #weasel
418 2018-02-05 22:57:48 @KayMccandless is making me an oil blend so i’ll feel better!!!! srsly i’m so blessed with such a great friend!!!
419 2018-02-05 22:57:43 No worries, they won't. Venezuela is perfectly capable of disrupting its oil industry by itself.
420 2018-02-05 22:57:01 Castor oil, shea moisture and Cantu
421 2018-02-05 22:56:49 That oil drilling was a great way to protect the marine wildlife you crazed politician

423 2018-02-05 22:56:44 I love when tv cooks say "a little olive oil" and then they pour in half the bloody bottle! JEEZ!
424 2018-02-05 22:56:43 It's Camellia oil. Boscia has a great one.
425 2018-02-05 22:56:37 Castor oil?
426 2018-02-05 22:56:37 It's time to change my oil but I don't wanna go buy a new FLITER n oil
427 2018-02-05 22:56:23 It should not have an overall affect volatility. Information is what usually causes volatility.  For example, when oil inventory reports don't match projections. Manipulation of info or insider knowledge can be contributors as well.
428 2018-02-05 22:56:05 LOL  well the good news is et's soooooooo easy to make and you don't need many ingredients just water, acv, coconut oil or olive oil and vanilla extract if you've got et 
429 2018-02-05 22:55:41 Please just say ‘oil’ when referencing it. It’s looking like it has nothing to do with fossils, as original speculated. Explains what we are finding on other planets as well. Anyway, you are showing my point in taxes and money grab. How much $$ will ‘fix’ this depicted problem?
430 2018-02-05 22:55:18 More evidence that the Roros are being cynically exploited to further the interests of Islam and oil.
431 2018-02-05 22:54:59 #food // this pizza i ordered has olive oil, spinach, tomatoes, onions, roasted garlic, mushrooms & feta on it, & i am in h e a v e n
432 2018-02-05 22:54:51 He just said that to sound intelligent and leader-like.  It doesn't matter if the oil prices have stabilized if he is too incompetent get it out of the ground.
433 2018-02-05 22:54:48 Oil is next to go down. It's going to drag the market in the dirt.  
434 2018-02-05 22:54:27 Niezgodze sie. ETF w US zawierają spółki Polskie. Wyprzedaż w US wpływa na wyprzedaż w Polsce bezpośrednio.  Mamy globalizacje i swobodny przepływ kapitału. 2. Na każdej giełdzie rządzą emocje. Trump dał, Trump odbiera, #blackmonday 3. Polska giełda to tylko zaścianek dla reszty.
435 2018-02-05 22:54:07 went looking for a DS charger in my brother’s old room and instead found a gamecube and PS1 (he said i could happily use :) but then i got on oil change and found out i need 3 new tires. idk if this is a good or bad day
436 2018-02-05 22:53:45 I need oil for my hair
437 2018-02-05 22:53:28 Yes Downer is involved with Uranium 1 and Woodside Oil as well. This was a big psyop over energy. Crazy.
438 2018-02-05 22:53:23 OMG, it makes me so nauseous! And yes, even before legal pot, there were TONS of hippie college kids who thought patchouli oil was a cromulent hygiene methodology.
439 2018-02-05 22:53:21 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.

441 2018-02-05 22:53:17 It has never made sense to the rest of us Africans why Africa's leading oil producer exports Cris and imports refined products. You should have a mega-refinery.
442 2018-02-05 22:53:16 Trump is to education as oil is to water
443 2018-02-05 22:53:15 STB: Oil & Gas industry
444 2018-02-05 22:52:43 But you've been short oil since $66 last week right?
445 2018-02-05 22:52:26 Keep an eye on capital flow too, which has been heading away from U.S. - companies have parked trillions offshore and if tax bill doesn't spur repatriation of some of those dollars, higher budget deficits, low bond yields, high oil and high P/Es will make for a nasty cocktail
446 2018-02-05 22:52:24 We need to vote out GOP!Get dark money out get rid of Citizens United! Education job training & unemployment ins & free job training paid by corporations! Healthcare for all.But most of all! Get us off Oil for good! It's our future their robbing us of! 2 decades behind bc of Oil!
447 2018-02-05 22:52:13 I have a grandson who graduated high school 3 yrs ago, didn't go to college, got OTJ training in the Oil & industry, making a six figure salary! No debt, big bank account!

450 2018-02-05 22:52:08 Correct. Oil sands are huge emissions producers and they need to be reduced to fight climate issues. Weak statement and weaker leadership on this issue. #cdnpoli

455 2018-02-05 22:51:48 Interesting to hear how the word "tar" was used as a scare tactic since it sounded dirtier than "oil". This happens a lot in media studies to further influence an audience (whether for better or for worse) #TarSands #OilSands
456 2018-02-05 22:51:37 I just purchased the Mahogany Teakwood. I like the patchouli scent. I buy tbe patchouli oil for myself.
457 2018-02-05 22:51:29 I started with AHA... my face hated it. I use tsubaki oil, now.
458 2018-02-05 22:51:07 Glad to hear it. Trump is trying to make the US self sufficient when it comes to oil, but there are other ways, Wind, solar, hydro, etc, to help that along.

460 2018-02-05 22:51:00 How does one even put that on? Do you need oil or something? Damn.

469 2018-02-05 22:49:15 Anybody know about this #XIV "termination." Some of us mere  #oil market folks are peering over the transom into equity land wondering if this is really a thing? #OOTT #shouldwebescared or #NothingToSeeHere

475 2018-02-05 22:48:17 What is an "oil monopoly"?
476 2018-02-05 22:48:07 "How to get dirty Russian Oil out"
477 2018-02-05 22:48:03 The new dream is to live on an offshore oil rig in international waters so I don't have to pay royalties for usage rights to crank mashups in a club I own and run.
478 2018-02-05 22:47:50 The way Chelsea are going down they’ll soon discover oil 
479 2018-02-05 22:47:29 OIL??? You still think oil brings in income? How ignorant can you be?
480 2018-02-05 22:47:23 I think this is why Trump wants the Mexican Wall so badly.  He's just dying to use a catapult or boiling oil on his enemies.  Ah, his mind swims with dreams of Medieval torture devices.
481 2018-02-05 22:47:20 You must be kidding. Was this some sort of comedy roast of you? With your pro oil / anti environmental / climate change denying stance this is laughable. Getting rid of you and the Retrumplican Party is the best thing we Americans can do to promote a healthy Ocean ecosystem
482 2018-02-05 22:47:20 Interesting they are never down at the Montreal Docks, protesting all that Foreign oil,hypocrisy abounds nothing to do with overall environment
483 2018-02-05 22:47:13 Cod liver oil running through me 
484 2018-02-05 22:47:02 Yes. I played with the calculator which penalises you for saturated fat. Coconut oil is akin to rat poison.
485 2018-02-05 22:46:59 ISLAMIC BILLIONS FROM OIL ARE INVEST IN WALL ST STOCK MKT. IT KEEPS IT GOING UP&UP. THIS IS FINANTIAL SIMBIOSIS SINOIST-ISLAMIC. JGR

488 2018-02-05 22:46:49 I told Jon he should put air filter oil on his filter and he said he doesn’t believe in it. Then he asked me why whenever he cleaned his carb it was full of shit...... hmmmmm #whatisbikemaintenance
489 2018-02-05 22:46:42 If you are very rich (the top 1% get 85% of the tax cut benefits). The rest of us get a small, temporary tax cut, if at all, and America is left with an increased deficit of $1 trillion we all will end up paying for. Snake Oil.
490 2018-02-05 22:46:40 well, 2 injured soldiers tonight. crob’s just dropped a frying pan full of boiling hot oil over herself and chloe  my first instinct was to fill the washing up bowl with cold water and splash them
491 2018-02-05 22:46:37 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
492 2018-02-05 22:46:36 ask that question to the us leaders you f looser,or “yalaka sigintilar surusu”us and eu are killing hundreds for oil in middle east africa etc. ulan yalakalar surusu,hadi birde abd nin liderlerine bunu sorun bakalim,

494 2018-02-05 22:46:28 I wonder if it would even be possible to replace the FRN (Federal Reserve Note) with an actual USD by cutting out the middle-man-fed, tacking back to gold instead of oil, and raising the fractional reserve rate to something like 50%? It's constitutionally congresses power!
495 2018-02-05 22:46:23 @AndrewBellBNN technical analysis on OIL please?

500 2018-02-05 22:45:23 And @realDonaldTrump boasted about having Carter on his team back in March interview with the WSJ.  Where he also brings up an oil guy that just plead guilty.
501 2018-02-05 22:45:16 In August 2013, Canada was sending the US an average of 2.6 MILLION barrels of oil from oil sands every single day...my brain is having so much trouble grasping this concept #Greenpeace

511 2018-02-05 22:43:52 The UK has oil and gas reserves, it has had since 1707 when the Act of Union was signed. The City of London raises more revenue than UK oil and gas. I haven't checked Labour since I stopped voting for them
512 2018-02-05 22:43:50 Ooooh and all kinds of perfume samples! I've never bought perfume in my life. I've worn some combo of vanilla, sandalwood and or jasmine oil since I was 13.
513 2018-02-05 22:43:41 How can any politician claim to be concerned about the distant future when they don't really do anything about the immediate one?  Global climate change is, like all other snake oil, designed to separate fools from their money and freedom. -me
514 2018-02-05 22:43:41 Find the best moisturizer for you in the winter. Creamy based moisturizers usually work best for winter skin. if you're taking the natural route, use things that have bananas, avocados, or almond oil

519 2018-02-05 22:42:55 @sjmuir ah but how 'bout all those hundreds of ALBERTA oil sands jobs that are being automated? If you don't believe there are going to be few permanent jobs o. You the TMP then you're wearing rose coloured glasses. As for majority of BCers for it?, your nativité is to laugh....
520 2018-02-05 22:42:26 ...You think reforming the USELESS-HOPELESS economy you left is a joke? Where's your logic? By the way, do you even know how these things work? Do you know who determines oil prices across the globe? Have you heard of OPEC? I'm not sure you do! And I won't even bother to educate

524 2018-02-05 22:41:19 Solarpunk? A wealthy Central Africa harvesting solar energy like the Sheiks rule oil now? Sounds fun to build a world like that, but could be read as racist too easily, so perhaps leave it to a black author - who'll also do it better.

531 2018-02-05 22:40:38 I also use Cantu’s leave in conditioner. And for oils I just use coconut oil and Jamaican black castor oil. That’s what I pretty much use on a semi daily/weekly basis

537 2018-02-05 22:40:05 ...In fact, did you EVER reduce fuel prices even with oil under your EMBARRASSING tenure? Did you? You (NDC) left us with an OVERHEATING fuel prices coupled with a DEBT-CHOKED MISMANAGED economy and you want the government now to arrest the prices in a matter of one year? Really?
538 2018-02-05 22:39:58 I got a stress relieving essential oil inhaler thing at work today and it actually works nicely
539 2018-02-05 22:39:55 @dddddddesirae Oof! Did you get the oil changed yet?
540 2018-02-05 22:39:53 As gas, heating oil and natural gas climbing fast too. Wholesale prices moving fast too! Not good
541 2018-02-05 22:39:46 Absolutely.
This market correction was in part caused by the bitcoin boom/bust.

Oil crashed in 2008 prior to Lehman Bros and RE. It's all connected.
542 2018-02-05 22:39:46 So you vote for oil drilling?
543 2018-02-05 22:39:29 Massaging vit E and bio oil into my scars tickles so much it makes me sick
544 2018-02-05 22:39:27 I bought an oil edible and completely forgot and I just found it in my purse. 
545 2018-02-05 22:39:24 I saw a video of a man cured of his shaking from Parkinson's in 1 minute from a few drops of cannabenol oil. Some people really are helped.
546 2018-02-05 22:39:12 Sad for these ppl who bought the snake oil.  Maybe all this recent “winning” will chg their minds.  Fingers crossed.
547 2018-02-05 22:39:07 You better give back all the tax relief and subsidies you currently enjoy from the government because yes those are from OIL revenues from ALBERTA.

549 2018-02-05 22:38:54 What lie? Russia publicly annouces when it buys n sells dollars. Russia only country that showed a profit in emerging markets Only one. Thanks to obama sanctions U can figure how many rubles per barrel of oil. Oil went down russia got more rubles per barrel Its simple economics.
550 2018-02-05 22:38:31 The way chelsea is going down..they might discover oil
551 2018-02-05 22:38:12 Tried oil and salt. Better than on its own but it still tastes weird. It has molasses in it too, so it tastes of MDF dipped in brown sugar.
552 2018-02-05 22:37:45 It’s like mixing chocolate milk and olive oil ..I don’t get it 
553 2018-02-05 22:37:44 You’re aging well. Watched you as Kirk Flowerbridge in Pie in the Sky the other day - from way back in 1997! Oil of Olay?
554 2018-02-05 22:37:42 Heating oil, natural gas and Gasoline rising at a record rate too! Wholesale pricing moving upward fast too. Not over yet!
555 2018-02-05 22:37:40 You can use the bulk to make shatter, dabs, oil, and edibles. There's plenty of non smoking uses for schwaggy weed, waste not want not.

569 2018-02-05 22:35:49 Perfect. Thanks for the clarification! I applied for Desert Bighorn as my OIL tag this year. 

Also - what impact will splitting up the seasons have on draw results? Will hunters who don't draw for an early season be put in for a mid/late season hunt?

591 2018-02-05 22:33:07 Yeah, while you reap financial rewards from allowing big oil to drill in your state in an area that is supposed to be protected. Greedy hypocrisy anyone?

598 2018-02-05 22:32:21 Yes. The problem isn't that you were warned about voting for a snake oil salesman. The problem is the arrogance of those who can''t believe you followed through with it.
599 2018-02-05 22:32:08 maybe we will look back and call this historical moment "The Snake Oil Years"?

603 2018-02-05 22:31:46 The issue is not the name, partial name that is.. It is that they are claiming the history that comes with the name.. They rewrote some of their books to claim that alexander the great was from there, named their airport, errected statues etc etc. It has added oil to the fire.

611 2018-02-05 22:30:53 It's basically when they use too much oil to maintain the intricate parts of a female. So it's usually said after we look at our bank statements that month and see how high our oil bills are. We will then say "This has to end."

693 2018-02-05 22:19:35 Today we heard from Norwegian Church Aid that oil companies in Norway pay 83% in taxes. Up from the 78% of a few years ago. That resources are not a curse and that it all depends on governance of wealth and natural resources. #AMI2018
694 2018-02-05 22:19:31 i use the dermalogica oil clearing matte moisturiser (it’s good for keeping skin hydrated + preventing spots!) and a prescribed (more creamy) moisturiser as well for extra hydration but any thick moisturiser would do probably. it works for me but do whatever is best for ur skin!
695 2018-02-05 22:19:30 The British "occupied" villages in France in WW1. In War that just means controlled. The American army was occupying the village in the sense it controlled and protected it. Don't be so touchy about America's benevolent foreign intervention that's alway war and always around oil.
696 2018-02-05 22:19:29 A veiled warning to be careful who they deal with? Just about any other nation would be a better trading partner than the US ever was? When was the next time the US bought barrels of oil from Mexico after 1936?
697 2018-02-05 22:19:27 Time to buy a little more oil stocks.

707 2018-02-05 22:18:05 And people thought that I was crazy to by oil stocks as New York was dumping theirs.

709 2018-02-05 22:17:41 Compare and contrast how we handled the North Sea oil money.

Where did it all go.
710 2018-02-05 22:17:41 How about the Saudi treatment of the Yemenis? Nobody ever criticises the Saudis because of all that oil, their human rights record is appalling.
711 2018-02-05 22:17:38 Eg. Sweden export just as much Norwegian gas and oil as they import and Norway is wealthier than Sweden due to it owning that amount of natural resources
712 2018-02-05 22:17:36 I need to go buy some more coconut oil asap

Veterans

714 2018-02-05 22:16:56 There are plenty of liberals that care about adultery and lying. I am a Christian first.  I am against abortion but I cannot defend Trumps actions. Also  what has Trump done for you that you defend his bad behavior? He is a snake oil salesman.  Why do you like the snake.
715 2018-02-05 22:16:44 Ya they and white supremacy has found a leader. Trumpski. How many ‘’ brown ‘’ people do you see in Russia. Where papa trump dabbled in oil and Donnie does the laundry
716 2018-02-05 22:16:42 I suspect the villains of the early to mid ‘70s were the oil crisis and corporate ambivalence to a Disney World without Walt.
717 2018-02-05 22:16:41 Same issue there. Tax breaks don't do anyone any good if you make 50K a year or less. They need permanent wage increases like 10k a year more. Not a freakin bonus snake oil bullshit.
718 2018-02-05 22:16:39 #Injun101: TY 4 ur enlightened opinion...we don't very often get the support that we deserve. We are trying our best to preserve this earth for our future generations...and oil & gas exploration runs against the grain of indigenous thought about the earth.
719 2018-02-05 22:16:32 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
720 2018-02-05 22:16:30 I’m trying it out as well! I think the reason why it leaves a sticky residue is because there is canola oil in the ingredients list! How long have you been trying it?!
721 2018-02-05 22:16:26 is CBD oil legal in Louisiana ?
722 2018-02-05 22:16:24 And the death of the palm oil industry altogether! and GMOs
723 2018-02-05 22:16:21 Peeve. If instead of doing this by country, you do this by currency used by the oil importer, the EZ is right up there with the other 2. This matters for lots of geopolitical/economic reasons.
724 2018-02-05 22:16:11 So #Cloverfield is just pulling a #Hellraiser with the sequels? Shoehorning themselves into other movies that are already made and claiming them? I want a real sequel about the oil rig... #cloverfieldparadox

740 2018-02-05 22:14:06 I wonder if Canada will ever figure out the concept of diversification - away from oil and real estate
741 2018-02-05 22:13:59 Oil brings us in £200m/yr in revenue (2016-17 GERS). It's all allocated to Scotland's revenue. What else do you plan to do to reduce the deficit of a mythical iScot to a manageable level?

743 2018-02-05 22:13:48 How are you going to implement this, especially in the oil and gas sector?
744 2018-02-05 22:13:42 @aicjofs @areezy obviously market participants anticipate oil prices here will not sustain. If that doesn’t pan out, ESV will fly.. patience

"S-stop!" She yelped. All the heat was forced into her cunt. It felt like it might erupt, Tanya didn't care what it took she just needed to cum!

As the oil gently soothed her pussy she felt the cock slip on with ease. Immediately there was a scream of delight--

754 2018-02-05 22:12:42 Wholesale prices up, notice heating oil , gasoline and natural gas prices climbing. Main street sees it and feels it! Here in Ct. Malloy already is figuring out how to get those tax breaks.
755 2018-02-05 22:12:40 @kenjilopezalt Had an issue with the second fry of the Twice Fried Buffalo Wings- oven method.  Had oil on medium low to heat up it and started occasionally bubbling over pot and onto stove.  Gave up for safety reasons.  Canola oil and large Le Crueset.  Any thoughts?
756 2018-02-05 22:12:34 Snake oil salesmen like Huckabee, Falwell and their ilk are the true sarcasm of faith. Their twisting and ignoring the teachings of Jesus for their own greedy and hateful purposes have turned a generation, and counting, off from the concept of "Faith"

758 2018-02-05 22:12:12 Put into warm water, tip some ice into the glass. Cold shrinks, heat expands.

Or try and get a little bit of oil in between them and twist in opposing directions.

Or put them to one side overnight, because they may well separate themselves tomorrow with no further intervention.

766 2018-02-05 22:11:09 How much was the oil change? I paid I think $60 for mine tho so it might have been a higher grade oil so I don’t need to get it changed as often?
767 2018-02-05 22:10:47 "also, put on lots of oil"
768 2018-02-05 22:10:39 You're a Trucker? I really hope you have a job lined up. Because Trump is going to end your business, he already gets every thing overseas... You will suffer the most, as less trucks are needed to transport oil & other goods. Enjoy unemployment fool!
769 2018-02-05 22:10:36 @michaeldarcy Did you know? The best energy security comes from indigenous renewable energy, not oil and gas which we cannot afford to drill for and use. Please support the Climate Emergency Bill. #OilBeHavingNoneOfThis #NotGasCraic

791 2018-02-05 22:08:14 Gently stroking her abs with an oil, it sunk into her skim and slowly released her from this heat. But it was if it was being pushed around piling another places. The fingers teasing her muscular frame making her gasp and moan.

793 2018-02-05 22:08:08 I understand that considerable focus is on the Dow.  But there were declines in the prices of oil, natural gas and copper today.  Confidence in global economic prospects dimmed a bit today, but too soon to get really upset.#weknewitwascoming

Like seriously guys, I'm okay, I don't mind using soap.
798 2018-02-05 22:07:17 When my car gets the oil changed I feel better
799 2018-02-05 22:07:04 An electrical store that also sells olive oil is worth tweeting about? Please tell me the exact location so I can book a flight based around your findings.

801 2018-02-05 22:06:24 Dear Chelsea Fans, palm oil investment can never bring crude oil profit.

The decision of The board, poor transfer policies and Conte's refusal to change his line up is the reason we are where we are.

Let's take our L in peace and hope for a Top 4 finish.

806 2018-02-05 22:05:47 I've been there. Had to quit playing at 29 due to cartilage damage to knees. In winter the pain was chronic & I was popping pills just to get any sleep!!
I found heat pads, cod liver oil, glucosamine sulphate tablets helped. Plus dropping a stone reduces pressure through knees.
807 2018-02-05 22:05:46 Sorry girl, but yeah it doesn't dry out my skin like most toners do. I think it helped with evening my skin tone. The citrus one worked really well for me bc it was oil controlling

809 2018-02-05 22:05:43 Senator, don't be silly. Fairness and @POTUS are like oil and water. If you really think it is possible you're being delusional like his acolytes.

811 2018-02-05 22:05:23 I bitch about this every chance I get, but thanks to him being in bed with Big Oil my home state (where he was AG) has more seismic activity than CA. Thank you very fracking much.
812 2018-02-05 22:04:47 And soon, the oil companies will get the karma they earned, too. Hope they enjoy their new lives, full of mid-air refuelings and cloudy skies beneath them all the time. Matter of fact, better get Elon to put some of his new solar shingles on the fuselages before he goes to Mars.

821 2018-02-05 22:03:39 If not for the ridiculously long oil change today, I wouldn't have met the nicest old man. I could've sat and talked to him the rest of the day and enjoyed every minute. Pretty sure God planned us to be stuck there together to remind me of what I had with my Grandpa. Missing him.

840 2018-02-05 22:00:24 People, like Trump, who blatantly tell lies rely on the psychology of speaking/lying confidently to instill faith into their easily duped audiences, that what they say is true. People like P.T. Barnum, snake oil salesmen, Hitler, Goebbels, etc...
841 2018-02-05 22:00:18 February 05, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

843 2018-02-05 21:59:57 are those oil shipments still coming in from venezuela?
844 2018-02-05 21:59:52 Right choooon, that one. The literary prowess on display is frankly staggering. That said, it’s probably reflective of the IQ required to blindly follow someone like that Russian oil tycoon.

846 2018-02-05 21:59:42 For me as well: cepe and truffle ravioli (Aldi, but, eh), loads of parmesan and cracked black pepper, and walnut oil.
847 2018-02-05 21:59:39 + and a wink before sweeping up the last of your mandrake and a large bunch of black moss.*

855 2018-02-05 21:57:52 Shoutout to my man for doing all the handy things for me like changing my oil and rotating my tires. It's nice not having to do that myself...but let's be honest, if he wouldn't take it upon himself to do it...I'd just ask my dad. Lmfao
856 2018-02-05 21:57:45 The rate Chelsea is going down, they will soon discover Oil
857 2018-02-05 21:57:17 @czabe  it was beef tallow and it is way healthier than the fake vegetable oil they switched to.
858 2018-02-05 21:57:00 Been sitting at sears for 2 hours waiting on them to do an oil change on this car

864 2018-02-05 21:55:51 Try my way, I make at least 2 whole sides every week. Preheat oven to 350. Pat dry, rub a little avocado oil, sprinkle onion, garlic, basil, cumin, oregano, parsley bake for 20 minutes, put under broiler for another 5 or so minutes until nicely browned. Bam! The best!
865 2018-02-05 21:55:06 Beets cook quickly in an Instant Pot--they can cook in less than 15 minutes!  No pot?  Roast them for a sweeter flavor with a little canola oil and seasoning.
866 2018-02-05 21:54:56 I feel like an apt comparison is oil painting. The means and technical advice to make beautiful oil paintings is widely available. The chances that I will ever make an oil painting that doesn't look awful are, rather sadly, remote.

873 2018-02-05 21:53:48 these millennials don’t know how to do anything for themselves. I was taught how to change my own oil, rotate my own tires, and Cobain myself
874 2018-02-05 21:53:44 Can you settle a dispute? Is it impossible to programme a mechanic that creates holes in sails when cannon balls are fired through them (repair with cloth, or else ships optimal speed isn't achieved), or to spill oil into water and set it on fire to deter ships that follow you?
875 2018-02-05 21:53:40 I have to go get an oil change and it’s giving me anxiety
876 2018-02-05 21:53:37 I do ride them out. This one is manufactured for the 1%ers in my opinion and was unnecessary. Putting tax on solar panels but gratituitously supporting oil industry and other bad tax decisions... etc. I am so ticked off.

883 2018-02-05 21:52:56 Armando is such an amazing boyfriend  he took my car for an oil change, he change my air filter himself, he rotated my tires by himself, he change my brake pads, and washed my car! Got my own mechanic

904 2018-02-05 21:50:21 Nigel, I think you’re mixing up “Irish Joke Irish” with actual Irish. We’ve had bullshit artists & snake oil salesmen like you roll up here for centuries. Just to play up to your stereotype I’ll tell you that you can stick your Irish exit nonsense “up your hole”.

924 2018-02-05 21:47:59 sure. keep in mind that many are acting irrational because they see an impending, real threat in their kid's lifetimes.

If sea levels rise as forecast it will create mass migrations that will destabilize the world. 

stopping oil sands is very important to many in this context.
925 2018-02-05 21:47:54 The heckling isn't helpful. People need to confront him with a logical, factual and professional approach. Make it clear he has misled and lied to Canadians and that his idea of growing the oil sands and reducing GHG's is incompatible.
926 2018-02-05 21:47:44 Risk-off mode also hurt oil prices, with WTI down almost 3%. This fits within a bigger profit taking wave which could be seen over the coming weeks (even without breaking the longer-term uptrend...)

934 2018-02-05 21:47:11 I watched (on @waltshaub 's recommendation) Dirty Money on Netflix. Episode 6, The Confidence Man, is all about Trump. Highly recommend it. @realDonaldTrump is nothing but a sleazy snake oil salesman.

937 2018-02-05 21:46:53 Well, you say that in jest but the EU importance is diminishing and the world is now entering around the Pacific rim.  The EU need to realise the world order is changing even in the Arab world with oil demand falling the EU isn't as attractive

983 2018-02-05 21:41:01 Last week my girlfriend bought me beard oil and beard wax. As a result, my beard, and therefore my life, has improved greatly. It’s so soft! I think possibly her motivations were somewhat self serving, but I’m very grateful. #enjoythelittlethings :)
984 2018-02-05 21:40:50 Except we have healthy exports, oil etc. RUK would have...debt. *lays cards on table*

995 2018-02-05 21:39:48 I called the US going into Venezuela so 'help' them over 10+ years ago. They are sitting on the largest oil reserve outside of the middle east. We will go in to 'help' to 'help ourselves' to their oil
996 2018-02-05 21:39:41 This name "autonomous vehicles" is worthy of a snake oil salesman. When I was a lad it's what we'd have called "a taxi". That's all it is. More bus services is a great idea.

1007 2018-02-05 21:38:12 Not saying that... Just saying beware salesmen selling snake oil promises.
1008 2018-02-05 21:38:12 How many people's lives is Trump going to destroy for the sake of rolling back Obama regulations? The coastal region of NC is going to be decimated too so some companies can drill for oil. Think before you vote @24Robertson

1015 2018-02-05 21:37:39 Canada is the only country stupid enough to restrict its own oil production so it can import crude from Saudi, Nigeria, Venezuela. Canada also says tankers are safe on E. coast but not West.

1066 2018-02-05 21:31:17 Actually in 2015, Canada had the worst growth in the G7.  True most of that was over oil prices so the economy under Harper did well, but you can depending on the argument make different ones.  Budget was close to balance but without sale of GM shares a small deficit.

1119 2018-02-05 21:24:51 the oil price fell too.

1122 2018-02-05 21:24:21 Our marine industry, shippers and oil shippers are 30 years behind those that adjusted to the Exxon Valdez. Also, why our taxpayers paying for this as that is not how it is done elsewhere like the State of Washington?
1123 2018-02-05 21:24:12 Former TH South and LSU QB Danny Etling has received an invite to 2018 NFL Scouting Combine in Indy at Lucas Oil Stadium.  Etling is first Terre Haute native to go to NFL Combine since Steve Weatherford in 2006.

1125 2018-02-05 21:24:01 Coconut oil is like Mother Nature’s gift for beauty. It’s the best thing for your hair skin nails everything. Ppl just love to bitch 
1126 2018-02-05 21:23:56 I put both! But only castor oil on my lashes obvi lol

1129 2018-02-05 21:23:14 In Syria, Yemen? Open "Odin.exe" from the Csomeoneese and someoneng off oil to Japan in response to this coup. 2001 . Now! Let it do this.
1130 2018-02-05 21:23:14 I don't understand why people don't make their own with just roasted nuts which exstinqish their own oil with vegan cocco and a little sweetness. Far tastier knowing nothing had to die!
1131 2018-02-05 21:23:09 Nope. Some acrylic, some oil. Rock hard. I also inherited some art material from my uncle & from a friend, so some of it is VERY old.
1132 2018-02-05 21:22:54 Thanks Obama. Oh wait, that was last week.
1133 2018-02-05 21:22:44 When you go for an oil change, your name becomes the model of your car. “Mazda6”...”Yes, it’s me”.
1134 2018-02-05 21:22:41 Is that instead of the egg/oil etc? Because that sounds amazing
1135 2018-02-05 21:22:34 saw someone using similar measure last year but relating it to spending level before the oil price drop.
1136 2018-02-05 21:22:24 Not says big there is NO effect before big in existence, just that it is not enough to be a cause for the shifts. How do you explain 7 known ice ages separated by ‘global warming’ paeriods before man existed? It’s not because I drive an SUV or used oil or gas to heat my home.

1142 2018-02-05 21:21:45 That’s why I always wear my glasses. However, I fear oil hitting my dingus because I like to fry bacon in the nude, with the lights low, candles glowing, and with smooth jazz playing.
1143 2018-02-05 21:21:42 EZ shares -1.3%, US shares -4.1% as Fed rate fears/worries re higher bond ylds continue to impact. US 10 yr bonds -13bp to 2.72% though as safe haven buying kicks in. Oil -2.5%. Iron ore +2%. ASX futures -2.3%. $A 0.7885 as $US up.  Yen also up on safe haven buying.

1161 2018-02-05 21:19:18 VIX oil high. Financials hit. Read a piece by Goldman explaining it all. Didn't understand a word but sounds like funds the problem. I say stock buy backs & change in fed & ending fed support of market. Time will tell.

1163 2018-02-05 21:19:00 I suppose it would be alarming to the cults that depend on each successive generation to be thoroughly brainwashed in order to survive and continue fleecing the flock in the snake oil Jesus con game. Other than that I'd say this a good news and a victory for rationality.
1164 2018-02-05 21:18:51 Eh , ask Norway if there’s no money in oil
1165 2018-02-05 21:18:45 Change the oil!
1166 2018-02-05 21:18:32 I  coconut oil in my @Dandy_Blend
1167 2018-02-05 21:18:25 I tried to tell @realDonaldTrump that Janet Yellen was a good federal reserve chairman. So now the CNBC types are trying to con us into believing it's oil prices coming down... 
1168 2018-02-05 21:18:20 if you tell someone to put coconut oil on their face you deserve jail time
1169 2018-02-05 21:18:15 No need for this - we are being sold snake oil again.  You are looking at around £3k for one of these.  It's too much money.
1170 2018-02-05 21:18:11 They better as Canada is almost 30 years behind the rest of the worlds marine industry, shippers and oil shipper who adjusted after the Exxon Valdez!
1171 2018-02-05 21:18:09 New York's $6 billion plan for offshore wind shows that oil drilling really is on the way out - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo unveiled a plan to develop 2.4 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030.
1172 2018-02-05 21:18:02 I rather have a #StockMarket correction in February than in October. The only good thing about this correction? Oil prices are dropping

1177 2018-02-05 21:17:35 A cool feature that comes with the more expensive option wiper blades purchased during my oil change is that that don’t work for shit
1178 2018-02-05 21:17:30 So I put coconut oil in my hair to treat it a little better, I feel like I've been dip in fry dry.

1198 2018-02-05 21:15:14 "In 2011, AFP launched a Running on Empty website and national tour featuring a 14-foot inflatable gas pump intended to link rising gas prices to the Obama administration’s environmental regulations and to promote offshore drilling for oil."
1199 2018-02-05 21:14:57 So from #OKSOTS Mary Fallin is a murderer and taxing the oil companies at a non competitive rate is way to make money. Guess we’ll be moving to Texas with them if the insane people get their way.
1200 2018-02-05 21:14:53 this reminds me of checking oil prices every day on the computers in Mrs. Raino's room
1201 2018-02-05 21:14:45 Bid picture, They’re all in it for money, the RNC and Russia. Russia gets as much as possible of the mess they’re making of the USA. That goes on by prior agreement with the big boss, RNC and Russia/China. The e made trillions with the tax scam. And oil deals/drilling
1202 2018-02-05 21:14:33 And we miss your analysis on such issues (esp. oil & gas) and want you to come back. #BringEricBack
1203 2018-02-05 21:14:32 Was reading up on Warren Harding's time as POTUS. He mirrors Trump in many aspects. Especially selling government land with oil on it to the highest bidder. Can you say "Teapot Dome?" Took away the equivalent to the Alternative Minimum Tax, increased tariffs, cut taxes on rich.
1204 2018-02-05 21:14:19 Take them somewhere nice, maybe Disneyland but not the frog one, the one in Orlando!!  They could work on their tans at the same time!!  My friend @17concreteangel could come along and oil them up!!  #floozy

He's a snak oil salesman!
1206 2018-02-05 21:13:57 That sounds lovely... Fjords, happy people, great coffee... But this is Britain, a very different place and culture to run that wasted all its N Sea oil proceeds, in massive debt, unlike Norway sitting on a saved pot of black gold. Idealism again in action.

1216 2018-02-05 21:12:45 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
1217 2018-02-05 21:12:36 I do understand that Lee. If I was doing new work I would use w/b tbh. The job I'm on at mo was done in oil before and she's said she's happy with oil again and it is in eggshell. So that makes sense. I don't like leaving on an evening and tasting it afterwards though 
1218 2018-02-05 21:12:23 You already admitted it - 99% If you consider that the sun created all the oil and coal on the planet
1219 2018-02-05 21:12:17 @lylybethhh coconut oil is magic
1220 2018-02-05 21:11:56 I remember them crediting Obama for all manner of things he had nothing to do with, like lowering the price on fuel (which went down because the price of oil went into a nosedive after an OPEC squabble)
1221 2018-02-05 21:11:54 Hey @SklarBrothers , did you ever remember the name of that beard oil you mentioned on @DPTpodcast with @danielvankirk and @Jackie_Michele ?
1222 2018-02-05 21:11:47 So where’s twitter boy today - Stocks continued down fall - huge medical cost  increases due to GOP plan, huge tax breaks for rich - middle class gets nothing - Gas prices up, in spite of huge record supplies - Big Oil not bringing back over sea cash - Oh Trumpster liar in Chief
1223 2018-02-05 21:11:46 That's why the government are so intent on getting it's mits on Venezula's oil, so it doesn't have to delve into it's reserves in Alaska; won't be much oil left by then once middle east and Venezuala deplete it's resources..
1224 2018-02-05 21:11:22 "AFP supports oil and gas development and opposes regulation, including environmental restrictions.The AFP Foundation opposed Obama's efforts to address global warming.AFP was important in creating the Tea Party movement & in encouraging the movement to focus on climate change."

For a fixed Young modulus, Poisson's ratio of 1-dim granular matter follows a scaling law as a function of energy input, necessary to generate nonlinear waves in the system with oil in interstices.

1384 2018-02-05 20:51:52 Sean, there are areas in the world and Australia, food of good quality can be grown and raised. The Isralies turned arid parts of their country around and made it flourish n production and beauty. 10 to 20 years ago, they said oil was doomed, now we have more & more reserves
1385 2018-02-05 20:51:43 No it's North Sea Oil for the downward commentary.
1386 2018-02-05 20:51:42 Even when cooked wth oil and garlic?
1387 2018-02-05 20:51:40 It is violent and glorious indeed. The (note)book of Jimboman once again leads us to the promised land. Violent or not, it is the power of the fractals, and the destruction of the bulls! Of course, we're not done yet :)
1388 2018-02-05 20:51:32 
1389 2018-02-05 20:51:30 We worked on the lumber delivered for our windows. Testing stains verses linseed oil. Linseed oil wins hands down. Productive Sunday! Fulfilling! #Maga
1390 2018-02-05 20:51:28 @Slugz nothing to be scared of. They have their oil prices hedged. Oil is still+$60. Their debt isn’t near as bad as people make
1391 2018-02-05 20:51:24 SLAP ON SOME PEPPERMINT OIL AND MOVE ON THERE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS HAPPENING
1392 2018-02-05 20:51:22 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

1399 2018-02-05 20:50:29 Bad or good is just opinion. As far as business I think it’s a good choice. As far as sentiment for the city and how much the oil rig is such a great logo. One of the best in conjunction to a cities reputation, I understand.  Houston is an oil town. But that’s business.
1400 2018-02-05 20:50:10 This olive oil got my hair smelling like puke 
1401 2018-02-05 20:50:05 Crude Oil should drop by 20%.
1402 2018-02-05 20:49:56 Lots of discussion in the Senate over a bill that would legalize CBD oil with minimal THC.  I answered a 20 minute call, and they're still talking about the bill.

1406 2018-02-05 20:49:29 They shouldn’t be happy with 4% considering that in other states, the oil companies are paying much more than that. As far as the casinos/gambling is concerned, the state pulled their part of the funding out which led to less money going to education.

1412 2018-02-05 20:48:07 Who still makes good ones? Just like the national  policy

1414 2018-02-05 20:47:55 Adam: We're no buying your snake oil.  You are a leaker and a liar.  The truth is known and full truth will be told.  Hope you're ready to run.
1415 2018-02-05 20:47:52 No need for exaggeration. They'd never oil it.
1416 2018-02-05 20:47:52 Dear Doritos, snacks already fit in my bag because I choose a bag that is big enough for my needs. And it's not the crunch that stops me buying your product, it's the vast quantities of deforestation-causing palm oil you use. Morons. #ladycrisps #speechless

1419 2018-02-05 20:47:33 I had a bunch of places that had oil boilers, and oil companies make renters pay in advance, so there were many winters when I'd be dragging home cans of kerosene and handfilling the tank 5 gal at a time.
1420 2018-02-05 20:47:33 Thank you for continuing to fight the corruptive and constitutionally challenged snake oil salesman and his equally corrupt family. History will honor you
1421 2018-02-05 20:47:33 Discovered by a "crude oil mine worker." You may need to get into editing.
1422 2018-02-05 20:47:28 Happy birthday to you sir. Fresh oil for Fresh Start to kick Start greater exploits.
1423 2018-02-05 20:47:24 Went in for an oil change and being told I’ve got the code for transmission wear. At 105K miles. FML.
1424 2018-02-05 20:47:13 The difference is, I  don't get paid to have a bullshit opinion like most of the climate alarmists on here who's mortgages and lifestyles depend on trotting out snake oil predictions to the gullible (That's you)

coconut oil ü butter is superhaldi , there is no way around. it just has to be fresh, organic, pure. so easy as that.
1429 2018-02-05 20:46:13 --she was dressed warmly, thoufh her usually fashionable clothes were dirtied by oil and grease. even some mud splattered her usually pristine appearance and her shoes were tired and worn*

1431 2018-02-05 20:46:01 She is a nut job snake oil salesman.
1432 2018-02-05 20:45:57 Took my car in for an oil change and well...you know the rest
1433 2018-02-05 20:45:54 The only time dark men and women are shown love on here is when they're covered in baby oil or doing something sexual. Y'all are beautiful irregardless but learn the difference between admiration and fetishization.
1434 2018-02-05 20:45:45 I LOVE being banned by this eejit, it tells me that he lost the argument. Suggest to this fool that you're a highly profitable oil producing independent country of 5 mil looking to join the UK, what is the UK offering to tempt us giving up our sovereignty?.. Answer = 
1435 2018-02-05 20:45:42 @McDonaldsUK is it true mozzarella dippers/cheddar melts etc are cooked in the same oil as the meat products  thought they were vegetarian
1436 2018-02-05 20:45:41 I was thinking of a study where pumpkin seed oil was protective against obesity and met syn. (less processed perhaps?)
1437 2018-02-05 20:45:36 That extra money in your paycheck will soon be going to inflated gas prices as oil prices undoubtedly will rise. And God forbid you need a loan in the future (3 rate increases THIS YEAR ALONE) 2 signature moves of a Republican POTUS. Just saying.
1438 2018-02-05 20:45:32 First of all it’s an oil paint she specifically did for them. Oil paint takes a lot of patience and work so she really didn’t upcharge them that much and second doing regular prices for regular people wasn’t paying her bills

1442 2018-02-05 20:45:23 Thank you so much for your informative posts. I am now on board. Looked at products we had at home with palm oil and will not buy any of them again. If we change the world one person at a time, you changed my world today!!

1448 2018-02-05 20:44:51 I hate getting my oil changed... they always want to “recommend” you do something.. my wallet doesn’t like your recommendations
1449 2018-02-05 20:44:46 No atmosphere = no fans = no success = no money = no oil
1450 2018-02-05 20:44:34 I hope @realDonaldTrump knows that the 2 worst performers in Dow today are oil companies.

1454 2018-02-05 20:44:00 Hahaha. They have lost me forever, Sean. Plus I hate the palm oil use too. X

1456 2018-02-05 20:43:51 After hours trade anyone. It's going to be a long day. #OIL need to confirm lower, but is strongly bearish right now. #gold pulled back down below resistance and is signalling higher still, need to #WATCH. #natgas volatility still has not popped, but it will, lower or higher?

1465 2018-02-05 20:42:44 #OOTT Oil market is down about 2.5 pct, and it's a sideshow at best today.
1466 2018-02-05 20:42:42 It was still finished on time... on budget... but we were screwed because no one had the foresight to see oil going up and electricity being a cash cow...

1489 2018-02-05 20:39:42 Thanks Olive. I don't feel hungry at all. I'm still eating most of the same things but just cut the cooking oil and marge right down! It's made all the difference!
1490 2018-02-05 20:39:38 Running deficit when interest is low & adjusting the child care Benefits based on income proved to big big wins. Stimulated growth, lifted thousands from poverty.

1502 2018-02-05 20:36:14 This makes me actually cry.

No responsibility for the companies should something like BP happen?
1503 2018-02-05 20:35:59 We need to stop pumping oil out of this planet like it's going out of style.  We wouldn't steal oil from your cars engine but yet billions of gallons are being pumped out daily. Ahh what do I know anyway

1518 2018-02-05 20:34:44 Climate change is more than unsightly oil rigs and oil spill risk. In fact this is trivial compared to carbon emissions. Its a nice sentiment senator but you are focusing on only one aspect of a greater and far more severe problem.

1523 2018-02-05 20:34:02 I'm starting to think our biomass boiler might be a white elephant. You'd think wood pellet supply would be easy, but many companies that do it are incompetent, rude, and unreliable. Our oil suppliers are lovely, friendly, and above all totally reliable.
1524 2018-02-05 20:33:13 Since I personally have not travelled the solar system & haven't read about anyone "real" who has--I can't speak to what it can or can't support. But I can say follow the oil. Fossil fuels supply Big AG who claims they feed the planet. Both industries are polluting the planet.
1525 2018-02-05 20:33:11 Can I use a hydrator than put my moisturizer ( shea butter and rose hip oil) on top of does it have to be another cream?
1526 2018-02-05 20:33:02 I'm much too delicate for a regular chip. When I'm craving something salty, I reach for Lady Doritos-- the softer, feminine alternative dipped in baby oil
1527 2018-02-05 20:32:45 *on the phone driving to get an oil change*

“How longs the wait?”
 
“There’s no one here so no wait”

*drives 2 minutes and gets to destination*

“Yeah so there’s like 5 cars ahead of you. It’s going to be about a 2 hour wait”

1530 2018-02-05 20:32:27 This coconut oil in my beard is AWESOME! Smells great too!
1531 2018-02-05 20:32:16 Honestly, the guy is a snake oil salesman when it comes to Cryptocurrency. You really should sit down with @derose to discuss archetypes as they relate to the Blockchain space. You would be shocked, bucko!
1532 2018-02-05 20:32:15 @Tesco why on earth don't you sell @BeavertownBeer beers? If you sold Neck Oil or Gamma Ray you could guarantee my custom
1533 2018-02-05 20:32:15 these are regular  i'm out of "special" oil :(
1534 2018-02-05 20:32:07 But you do approve of oil companies writing energy laws and the NRA writing gun laws?  Do you approve of a congressman representing his party, not his constituents?  I live in Janesville, apparently my vote doesn't matter anyway.

1536 2018-02-05 20:32:03 "It smells like cardamom oil." -Martha
1537 2018-02-05 20:31:54 ..also worth noting that indeed many of those countries do have oil & water etc. though not entirely sure what kind of batshit point you were even trying to make there.
1538 2018-02-05 20:31:49 If his base truly believes him, they are too far gone.  Especially with this kind of presentation that screams snake oil salesman with no conscience.
1539 2018-02-05 20:31:47 Nobody ever said "narratives which presume that the technicians involved in this field are  all amateurs, complete idiots, selling snake oil to the easily fooled." I've only questioned what meaning a dog alert with nothing to find can have.

1544 2018-02-05 20:31:11 What a total load of pork pies, name one average person who works a normal basic job that earns more money now since big business tax cuts has happened anywhere in the world? It's never happened anywhere & never will. Snake Oil cures all will be the next claim #auspol
1545 2018-02-05 20:30:39 Bruh I’ve been cleaning hydraulic oil all damn day!
1546 2018-02-05 20:30:34 Our daughter is fighting cancer as well. God bless her and your entire family!  also look into Cannabis Oil. There is hope look at all alternative treatments. THC does kill cancer and CBD stops the mets. Most important is her diet; stay way from Sugar it feeds the cancer!
1547 2018-02-05 20:30:24 What do you know about Canada's oil pipeline? Tune in at 4:30 p.m. to learn about the pros and cons of providing #energy to the world.
1548 2018-02-05 20:30:21 So it has nothing to do with the petrol/gas/oil sales?
1549 2018-02-05 20:30:15 97% of climate scientists agree with man made global warming, the oil lobby has spent billions to seed doubt. For the sake of argument, let' say you are right, global warming is a myth & we clean up, what's the worst we can end up with, clean water & air? Tragic! #GlobalWarming
1550 2018-02-05 20:30:15 OIL DIFF: 3.82 -> 3.86
1551 2018-02-05 20:30:12 Yep during Indy WM envelopes it in an invisible cloak. Think about how much tax it WOULD bring in if we actually made the oil companies pay tax?
1552 2018-02-05 20:30:01 This is the Lord Doing and it's marvellous in our eyes.  Congratulations Ma.  It's a New Dawn Ma.  Fresh Oil Ma. Happy Birthday Ma
1553 2018-02-05 20:29:56 When comparing BC Forests destroyed for lumber & Alberta Oil Sands both reclaim & repair land after. Difference is Oil Sands area is much smaller, repaired immediately & pales in comparison to areas destroyed by lumber for BC export. Reclaiming is 50-80 years
1554 2018-02-05 20:29:49 Don’t have to worry about paying for another car wash or oil change 
1555 2018-02-05 20:29:48 i think that this hangover might be permanent...
1556 2018-02-05 20:29:25 There’s a gud un behind the park view pub opposite Turf Moor I go to that n all good chip oil’s are few n far between Pal 
1557 2018-02-05 20:29:16 oil changes are always so awkward to me. 

(partly because i have NO clue what they’re talking about when they ask me car questions)
1558 2018-02-05 20:29:15 How about investing in some oil to heat the schools first#priorities#capitationshouldbeagiven#costofictmaintenance
1559 2018-02-05 20:29:10 Please don't encourage Nutella consumption. It uses non sustainable palm oil which is being farmed in  and destroying  the natural habitats of orangutans resulting in their deaths.
1560 2018-02-05 20:28:54 And didn't Cameron and Obama go to war in Libya? Because Gaddifi was threatening to sell oil in the gold dinar, not the US dollar.
1561 2018-02-05 20:28:38 I usually end up burning the midnight oil big time staying awake through the night working. I feel for you with two when one about exhausted me to a mental breakdown

1563 2018-02-05 20:28:32 I got home to find out I fuckin forgot coconut oil 
1564 2018-02-05 20:28:07 I don’t come up frfr I LOVE coconut oil & clear lip gloss lmao
1565 2018-02-05 20:28:05 Levying a tariff on foreign oil is one of the few revenue generators that the President can do without Congress --  Trump could do it tomorrow, if he was serious about America First, instead of playing at it. Saudis have raised price of gas by a buck at least. Fight back!
1566 2018-02-05 20:28:04 Why have I not used bath oil before? What an absolute dream
1567 2018-02-05 20:27:58 the stock market collapsed while i was getting my oil changed
1568 2018-02-05 20:27:41 Niggahs dont know how to fight, change oil, or nothin. You niggahs just do drugs & cry.
1569 2018-02-05 20:27:40 "Lady Doritos" is the Bride of Frankenstein: she's still made with GMO corn, fried in oil, and dusted with orange cheese dust. She is Femme Fatale. A minute on the lips; a lifetime on the hips.
1570 2018-02-05 20:27:37 Sorry I’ve been absent the past few days. I’ve had a super busy week. Thank you all for being patient! Going to sign on to #chaturbate now to do a much requested oil show. Come play with me!!
1571 2018-02-05 20:27:37 are we back in the 1950's? cuz i sure dont see a lot of respect for elders or reusable milk bottles anywhere
1572 2018-02-05 20:27:19 Interesting to discuss strategies for payers to discourage low-value care. Ideally, docs shouldn’t prescribe snake oil, but how to stop snake oil prescribing w/out making patients unhappy? #NHPC18
1573 2018-02-05 20:27:13 He’s also been playing a lot of center recently and I think they dressed 10 forwards this weekend.   That’s a tough spot for a rookie winger.   Similar to the position the Oil put Drake in last season. Maybe they can move him in the offseason?
1574 2018-02-05 20:27:08 Do you find yourself afflicted with a painful anus? Roll caraway and fat of an antilope into a pill and insert it in the anus. If this doesn't work, make a suppository out of ground cow horn, some dried oil, and yeast of wine and insert. #AncientEgyptianRemedies
1575 2018-02-05 20:27:00 All oil companies are down. I was just saying that Saudi Arabia was rerouting the oil to China. Keep your eyes open!
1576 2018-02-05 20:26:47 Aside from the olive oil you did well
1577 2018-02-05 20:26:44 If you're looking for an at-home treatment, let me preface with consistency is key—but i swear by egg yolk, mayo, avocado, olive oil, and banana.
1578 2018-02-05 20:26:34 I make handmade soaps and made a soap and lotion the other day using Plumeria fragrance oil smells amazing..
1579 2018-02-05 20:26:32 If that was a taxi, it would have its plate removed, prohibited and I'd expect it to require re-plating. Should be the same with PHVs. If he's got bald tyres, I know its got oil like Marmite.
1580 2018-02-05 20:25:49 fun fact: fashion retail is the 2nd largest industry in the world next to oil and gas
1581 2018-02-05 20:25:46 maybe if i scream “lalalalala” loud enough my vehicle will magically fix itself and i won’t need a never-ending amount of oil bc it’s a piece of shit and is burning it + the engine/potentially a new transmission/alternator 
1582 2018-02-05 20:25:38 It’s a sad day but I must finally admit defeat and give up my fave brand of tuna. No Drain tins = no good. Dry and a strong flavour not mellowed by a good soak in olive oil. @johnwest_uk it was good while it lasted. Let me know if you start adding the proper amount of olive oil
1583 2018-02-05 20:25:29 The avocado oil one is really good.  And rarely any partially popped ones at bottom that hurt your teeth
1584 2018-02-05 20:25:18 Literally got an oil change, my nails done, and grocery shopping all done at Walmart :-) adult life
1585 2018-02-05 20:25:03 Got the all natural skin care line in the works!  I have face scrubs, moisturizers, toner, and an oil based facewash meant to keep your skin moist and glowinnn . Hmu if your interested 
1586 2018-02-05 20:24:59 South Africa getting a count down on it’s water supply should cause a major downturn eventually.
 Energy asset(Big Oil) are going to get a more realistic valuation relative to climate change realities.
1587 2018-02-05 20:24:54 Castor oil is good for promoting hair growth and thickening.
1588 2018-02-05 20:24:43 Eating breakfast and reading the paper to find that oil drilling might happen off the coast of Cali, gas prices will be up to $4, and retirement costs expected to double.. welcome home to America haha
1589 2018-02-05 20:24:39 My hands look like they’re made out of oil paint
1590 2018-02-05 20:24:00 Palm oil is destroying rainforest, don't buy this revolting rubbish!
1591 2018-02-05 20:23:51 We get a few bucks in our paychecks, but get to drink dirty water & breath polluted air while big oil blocks progression of #greenenergy! Shame on you for using $billions to build a wall when 60,000 American die every year from NO #HEALTHCARE! You support CORPORATE TAXPAYER THEFT

1602 2018-02-05 20:22:09 Stock markets down, oil price down, gold down, cryptos down, I guess is time to invade some 3rd world rich dictatorship or narcostate to collect their assets and balance the sheets...
1603 2018-02-05 20:21:37 You know the popular moccasins are made fro "Moroccan leather" , which is actually Sokoto leather.

Sokoto, Kano and Maiduguri lost out on what made them big originally, because of cheap crude oil money.
1604 2018-02-05 20:21:34 Early Chinese and Egyptian documents exist which tell of how these advanced cultures used herbs, oil, citrus and even soap as pesticides.
1605 2018-02-05 20:21:33 Don’t think the debate was moved at all .. @JuliaBradbury ‘s point was about Palm oil being used in Nutella, which it is. The report, from what I can see, mainly focuses on fair pay, peat, pesticides etc. A different connotation of ‘sustainable’
1606 2018-02-05 20:21:25 Sorry I dotted the i’s with hearts on your grocery list for pineapple juice and coconut oil. 

Hint level: MASTER
1607 2018-02-05 20:21:24 trying to write a poem about oil painting techniques relative to the self and tbh it's a mess but this is stage one, it'll get better.
1608 2018-02-05 20:21:21 I barley use heat on my hair(only once-twice a month) I wash my hair every other day, before I brush my hair out after the shower (with a wet brush) I put coconut oil on my ends only

1611 2018-02-05 20:21:11 The amount of oil in the ocean is terrifying.
1612 2018-02-05 20:20:59 Got some more oil from Carrots Dc it smell so good
1613 2018-02-05 20:20:48 This makes you happy? Price of oil is coming down and that makes cheaper fuel prices. Thats good for Americans  so that makes you sad
1614 2018-02-05 20:20:13 I’ve recently tried Argan oil & it works wondersssss on my hair!! I use coconut oil on my face too but I heard it wasn’t good either 
1615 2018-02-05 20:20:12 Someone should pour oil on the bathroom tiles so this devil can slip and be taken home. I can't stand Bitto mehn wtf

1617 2018-02-05 20:19:45 "This state made a BAD DEAL with the oil and gas industry. We need to get back to 7% so we can fund our kids adequately." - @repcorywilliams

1629 2018-02-05 20:18:23 I think you’ll find it had something to do with the Middle East, oil, & OPEC.
1630 2018-02-05 20:18:17 How much oil?
1631 2018-02-05 20:18:05 It was thanks Obama yesterday.
1632 2018-02-05 20:18:01 Yes. They call me the great enabler. Enjoy your edible oil.
1633 2018-02-05 20:17:52 I didn’t realize how dirty my car was until I took it to get an oil change and I can see them vacuuming and taking out all my garage... whoops

1640 2018-02-05 20:16:44 I was supposed to go get my oil changed at 7. I'm still in bed dying.

1657 2018-02-05 20:13:01 Juicing is a must
Lemon, ginger, and turmeric w 12 oregano oil drops. 

That's the farmacy right there
1658 2018-02-05 20:12:55 What caused the Dow drop?
1. Debt fueled tax cut stimulus
2. Wage inflation
3. Oil prices dropping
4. Wells Fargo getting put in check

1659 2018-02-05 20:12:52 I'm sure it's lovely - right now, with my arm still feeling it after hauling out the rubble, and with 25 year old heating oil stuck under my nails, I've got more mixed feelings.

1663 2018-02-05 20:12:17 Which are the euro, trade in EU area, paying for Greece et Al. Admin fee on your cash back (?) , free gimmigration, shared fishing rights (watch that oil), EU tariffs (a fun read), and being 1 of 28 in votes. Sounds great!

1665 2018-02-05 20:12:09 Welp, Trump did tie the success of his presidency to the stock market. 

The president has as much impact on the economy has he does in the price of oil.
1666 2018-02-05 20:12:07 I've been reading correction and oil market impacts.

1686 2018-02-05 20:09:36 My original point which was reasonable is that Trump is touting his tax benefit for the middle class... while analysts were projecting gas can go up as high as $5 per gallon.  Bottom line no savings or loss.  But oil CEOs I'm sure will be compensated as they always are.
1687 2018-02-05 20:09:10 @Tesco love the coconut oil moist toilet tissue........but would love a dispenser to put them in too!!
1688 2018-02-05 20:09:07 Damn 1066!
1689 2018-02-05 20:08:45 can we just go ahead and deport that 20% instead? i'm sure there are plenty of decommissioned oil rigs just ripe for resettlement.
1690 2018-02-05 20:08:43 Our best strategy for dealing with Russia is through declining oil prices, to force them to leave Ukraine and stand down the threat to the Baltics and Europe. We were heading there, but this administration is reversing those policies, effectively putting $$$ in Putin's pocket.
1691 2018-02-05 20:08:40 Thanks you too sure. Can I call you oil instead of oli

You will now utterly failed to offer an explanation. Thinking of engineering solutions such that solar energy can be used as humanity’s primary energy source is only dangerous to the bottom line of oil and coal interests

1706 2018-02-05 20:06:12 Although the tar sands in Alberta offer a lot of employment opportunities, I think its time for this kind of extraction of oil to be stopped. These oil sands are becoming increasingly environmentally friendly; however, the amount of area needed is insane! #lesson5 #PHYS273

1710 2018-02-05 20:05:31 Point is, oil prices are market function. Oil cos can lose money or make depending on supply/demand. 2 years ago they were sold in the red, no complaints from people then.

1714 2018-02-05 20:04:36 Time to play “OIL / GAS WELL NAME OR RACEHORSE NAME” !! (A thread)
1715 2018-02-05 20:04:32 The oil taken in Scottish waters should be - but with climate change and all - moving towards renewables big time. Orkney and Shetland set up an oil fund. The British Government should have too - but never did and Scotland never had control of its oil revenue

1718 2018-02-05 20:03:48 Did Tillerson ever lose money when he was an oil CEO?  While the average American consumer will lose money... oil CEO's always make profit and the income inequality generated by the system is my original point.
1719 2018-02-05 20:03:23 OMGOODNESS!  The Dow is down 770 points!  Thank you Oil!  Anything north of $50 oil is fantastic and because we get paid as we go, these big swings are not nearly as traumatic!
1720 2018-02-05 20:03:17 Dow is now down 800.  No comment from Clown Shoes.

You've been had by a snake oil salesman.
1721 2018-02-05 20:03:15 Your chart is BS. 
My statement is the truth & common sense. The sun & wind were used as the only source of energy of human society for 1000s of years before oil & coal. Oil & coal are, in fact, stored solar energy. 
Now we have the ability to harvest the sun’s energy directly
1722 2018-02-05 20:03:11 Just the facts ruble was at 30 obama put sanctions on russia ruble shot up to 80. Russia had usa  dollars. They cashed in their dollars got 2 1/2 times rubles. Oil went down russia got same rubles
 Didnt hurt them at all. Putin hell of a leader.

BTW, POTUS 63 George Bush VI just declared war on it (something about oil). Yep, he's GOP
1757 2018-02-05 19:59:42 Oil companies don't "raise prices", prices are a function of supply and demand. Lately, very strong demand and OPEC cutting supply are pushing oil prices up. It's a market value.

1782 2018-02-05 19:56:48 No way!! Funnel cakes have holes in them, elephant ears are just flat. I like take biscuit dough and fry it in some oil, add powered sugar and chocolate - definitely satisfies the craving for that stuff if you're in a pinch.

1795 2018-02-05 19:55:14 @Sawbones Could you do a show about hemp oil? It is starting to sound like a cure all. 
1796 2018-02-05 19:55:00 We applaud the efforts of Nutella and other companies in the pact. But, we looked into this and concluded that “sustainable” palm oil is somewhat oxymoronic. It basically means the source farm slashed and burned the rainforest years ago, as opposed to new farms doing so now.
1797 2018-02-05 19:54:45 my auto correct just changed chik fil a to chin oil in the middle of a class discussing death and I just couldn't handle it
1798 2018-02-05 19:54:40 Wow.. magnifique.... is Oil?
1799 2018-02-05 19:54:35 Those 3 have to be no brainers. Still young and Klefbom and Larsson are on cheap value contracts. If we can get Nurse for under 5M then that’s 3 out of 4 top 4 Defense man under 15M combined
1800 2018-02-05 19:54:32 Looks more like a sheetz wawa doesn’t sell motor oil
1801 2018-02-05 19:54:11 I've got a whole weekend routine around your stuff now - cuticle oil, body butter, polish. I did not use to be a beauty products kind of girl.  What have you done to me?
1802 2018-02-05 19:54:05 Mix in eight pounds of olive oil then bring to a boil.
1803 2018-02-05 19:54:01 these people taking forever to do this oil change
1804 2018-02-05 19:53:47 Nope, you didn’t miss it, he hasn’t mentioned the stock market falling once. He sounds like a delusional snake oil sales man.
1805 2018-02-05 19:53:45 Don’t let that line trick you into thinking I’m above Micky D’s. But I will never forgive them for being hoodwinked into cooking their once-perfect fries in veggie oil
1806 2018-02-05 19:53:36 How does the middle class benefit from the tax plan if Tillerson's Exxon and the other oil companies are raising gas prices up to 2 dollars a gallon this year?

Small stipend for the poor and middle class... 1.5 trillion saved in estate and corporate taxes.

1808 2018-02-05 19:53:17 I’m so damn jealous of people who are loved by someone and who know what they are supposed to do with themselves in literally any way/shape/form. Lol. I’m just a human shaped oil spill.
1809 2018-02-05 19:53:09 For such a small country like Venezuela, they are numero uno proved oil reserves in the world, astounding! Saudi Arabia and Canada come in 2nd and 3rd #Lesson5 #PHYS273
1810 2018-02-05 19:52:49 Little Cesar sitting in ride on car, "I need an oil change... Wait, no I just need to drink oil"
1811 2018-02-05 19:52:47 Yup. McDavid is LeBron. Near his prime. And here the Oil are.

1818 2018-02-05 19:52:08 just ran out of oil. Already had a new tank of oil on order… But I’ve had to go the whole weekend without, as it won’t come until tomorrow.

1823 2018-02-05 19:51:53 The funny thing is those great jobs numbers were from fracking and shale oil boom
1824 2018-02-05 19:51:27 Whoa damn! That's badass!  It almost has the kind of glossy rainbow color of oil!
1825 2018-02-05 19:51:23 Oil is world price so please explain that to me.
1826 2018-02-05 19:51:05 I avoid palm oil. Although Morrison and Sainsbury do say theirs is sustainable. Don't know how sustainable that really is though!
1827 2018-02-05 19:51:03 Great food Chef
1828 2018-02-05 19:51:03 Sorry. Can't vote in Scotland. Or pay sturgeon tax. Is that for water or free uni for EU students? You'll need that oil.
1829 2018-02-05 19:50:48 A very pretty oil and mehndi tray
1830 2018-02-05 19:50:31 been way more strong than would have thought possible, same with Gold, and Oil.
1831 2018-02-05 19:50:29 I'd recommend reading more about it. Hard to believe that applying evolutionary principles to humans would be "snake oil"

1833 2018-02-05 19:49:58 Jordan, how does the old you feel about Trudeau's admission that the "Oceans Protection Plan" is a $1.5 billion subsidy to the oil industry, conditional on TMX getting built?
1834 2018-02-05 19:49:38 There was some power in those paws and he rubbing the oil into you  RIP John
1835 2018-02-05 19:49:15 1st listened to him right around the peak oil craze of mid 2000's .  never heard much more but what he said about U.S. drowning in oil always stuck with me.   turns out he may have been right on after all...
1836 2018-02-05 19:49:03 USD/CAD putting in another solid up move today and the CAD/oil correlation not sending positive vibes. CAD and Oil both looking very weak. Will keep an eye on this one to see if the USD/CAD has bottomed here, as well as the dollar overall.

1839 2018-02-05 19:48:53 Why is it called vegetables oil yet it's extracted from seeds?

1845 2018-02-05 19:48:28 SAY IT AGAIN! I get so freaking emotional when it comes to carnival: from the lyrics to our music, throwing my arms wide or hugging my friends in a fete, donning paint, oil and mud for j’ouvert, and looking forward to slaying in my costume.
1846 2018-02-05 19:48:24 RSO and dabs but everybody’s physiology is different and will respond differently. High THC or at least a 1:1 or similar ratio. Medicine is expensive here but a $60 syringe of oil might last a month
1847 2018-02-05 19:48:02 In case anyone's listening, why do we have palm oil in all our food? We had all the same types of foods back when companies used oils produced in the USA.
1848 2018-02-05 19:47:45 Who would've known that coal and oil comes from million year old plants and microscopic aquatic organisms..certainly not me. Although that is why they're called "fossil" fuels, should've put two and two together #Prehistoric Energy # Lesson5 #PHYS273

1856 2018-02-05 19:46:53 And it if it wasn't for immigration. My father in law wouldn't have moved here and I wouldn't have wife or wonderful children. A bit like Nigel farage! Hypocrital lying racist snake oil salesman that he Is!
1857 2018-02-05 19:46:49 Man I really love spending thousands of dollars to learn about Dr. Rinehart’s crazy motorcycle ride and his oil leak.
1858 2018-02-05 19:46:42 So if it's true they used motor oil or hydraulic fluid to grease the poles in Philadelphia, was it organic and breaks down, or same hydrocarbon based products both state and federal laws would charge you for, with severe penalties, for deliberately releasing into the environment?
1859 2018-02-05 19:46:40 SCOTLAND HAS SPECIAL OIL - IT SHRINKS WHEN A INDY VOTE IS DUE AN IS SURPLUS WHEN ITS NOT.......HARRY POTTER HAS NOTHING ON OUR OIL "North Sea oil will bring in about £1bn in tax this financial year, a startling reverse from previous 12 mths when it failed to generate any rev.

1863 2018-02-05 19:46:12 She could have left the Obama admin & complained. She decided to stay and be complicit. Hillary helped to privatize oil in Mexico which ruined many people's economy and she backed the mexican drug war which killed thousands. She supports NAFTA & TPP which oppress MX workers

1879 2018-02-05 19:44:51 8 ou 9 nouvelles taxes crées en 2018 je n’augmente pas mes impôts les taxes c’est quoi ? Des gains de pouvoir d’achat ( GAS oil etc,,.)
1880 2018-02-05 19:44:48 Including her study last year about oil & gas reserves in the world,  Russia has the most & can't sell it to the world because of sanctions by the U. S. Pretty obvious where this is going...
1881 2018-02-05 19:44:30 Those orange oil cleaners they sell everywhere? NASA cleans launchpads with that.
1882 2018-02-05 19:44:05 Depending on the engine, cambelt may be due, gearboxes respond well to oil changes, 1.8 and 2.0 go okay for what they are. I (think) all of them are 4x100 pcd wheels so if it needs tyres can get MX5 wheels on there
1883 2018-02-05 19:43:58 Et pourquoi ne pas baisser plutôt les taxes sur l'essence plutôt que d'augmenter le gas oil ?
1884 2018-02-05 19:43:41 i cooked my knuckle and got an oil burn i’m never cooking again
1885 2018-02-05 19:43:36 Which Chivita? You're not even saying Engine oil
1886 2018-02-05 19:43:31 Ask yourself this. After 70+ years of the USSR, what, apart from oil, does Russia produce today? It seems from the outside they just do not have a culture of combining invention, innovation with commercial enterprise. For a country of 140m, it's remarkable.
1887 2018-02-05 19:43:13 Check your Engine oil this weekend.

1891 2018-02-05 19:42:10 I didn't say bottom out lol but your other post you say your predictions were right.  Want your prediction for year from today.  Just give a # for S&P.  Maybe for 10Y gov debt and oil prices to complete the loop.  I'm 2.75% and $60/barrel.  Let's see what you got sir.

1902 2018-02-05 19:39:31 Nice to see some people be accountable about protecting our enviroment. Oil will run out eventually. Time to get ahead
1903 2018-02-05 19:39:30 I Need A Oil Change...
1904 2018-02-05 19:39:30 It pretty much puts a halt to both selling off public land to the mineral extraction/oil and gas industry and to furthering any of 45 other policy goals. 

Puts the brakes on the whole thing and leaves him stuck in Washington twiddling his thumbs.
1905 2018-02-05 19:39:14 Lmao, that’s what the Oil is meant for innit 
1906 2018-02-05 19:38:55 I've just spent my last cent on a special offer for heating oil, so we'll be warm, at least. No plans to go anywhere, thankfully. #smartnetworking
1907 2018-02-05 19:38:50 Bitcoin down over 17%. Dow Jones down nearly 600 points. Oil down over 2%. S&P down nearly 2%. Sell off or a healthy rebalancing?
1908 2018-02-05 19:38:49 Oil is world price.
1909 2018-02-05 19:38:19 So nobody in Boston got vape oil for under $30? 
1910 2018-02-05 19:38:13 I know. England here. I would vote for total independent Scotland. Obviously for the wrong reasons, but you'd be fine without us and any of our cash. As to oil, bit late now! Don't worry, EU has loads! Cheek, tongue!
1911 2018-02-05 19:38:11 The bond yields are down too..That is very unusual
1912 2018-02-05 19:38:05 We haven't even anywhere near tried capitalism. Nuclear weapons and oil are give you them.
1913 2018-02-05 19:38:03 I tend to go on the say so of ‘experts’ of the likes of HM Treasury NOT snake oil merchants like Farage, Johnson, Bone & Gove for my information. They’re bound by integrity, professional standards and conduct. Give it a try.
1914 2018-02-05 19:37:53 Actually that’s not true. England lived off Scotland’s oil for awhile. Forestry - big business. Whisky - big export. Getting big for renewable energy now. Only reason the referendum went the wrong way is the number of English people living there now

1927 2018-02-05 19:37:06 Titus Lunter has announced he is a full time oil painter.
1928 2018-02-05 19:36:59 Make your own - much better and no palm oil
1929 2018-02-05 19:36:50 Yes, palm oil. That's what I'm saying. There is no logical excuse for purchasing products using palm oil due to the sheer level of biodiversity loss it causes.
1930 2018-02-05 19:36:49 Fossil fuels and big oil will not go down without a fight.  Political influence by oil money and coal funded lobbyists will continue to fight hard to prevent solar and wind and clean energy from gaining momentum.
1931 2018-02-05 19:36:45 oil prices are at 2 year highs, hush.

Cannabis sect would have given me more oil which could then result in basically retching kidneys into insufficiency . Was very lucky with astute ER doctor. Worry about these kids
1939 2018-02-05 19:35:59 I was 14. 
I walked into Michaels for the first time ever and look up at the foreign languages. Acrylic, Oil, Gouache, etc... 
I knew nothing about canvas so I ripped apart my laptop cardboard box and painted a picture for my dad of his favorite rapper KRS- One.
1940 2018-02-05 19:35:56 The world markets are all down , gas , oil , Bitcoin and Bonds too. Usually when stocks are down the bond yields go up. CNBC says "something strange" is going on.....More sellers than buyers today , so downward trend may continue. Wage and interest rate increases are factors...
1941 2018-02-05 19:35:56 My dick smells like coconut oil lmao.. swag
1942 2018-02-05 19:35:54 Coffee with a bit of butter and coconut oil.  Basically all fat, no protein/carbs. If I drink it in the morning I’m usually fine until late lunch or even dinner. And it tastes pretty damn good!
1943 2018-02-05 19:35:46 What happened to ' Thanks Obama?' 
1944 2018-02-05 19:35:35 You going to pine oil heaven boii
1945 2018-02-05 19:35:24 I need an oil change, who wants to pay for it? #paypig #findom #cashmaster #sugardaddy
1946 2018-02-05 19:35:15 Well, I see fountains of water or oil, but apparently it’s someone picking rice.
1947 2018-02-05 19:35:14 Find out if the girlfriends have a favorite chocolate type: then they have a better chance of getting it 100% right. Always ask if the chocolate has cocoa butter, that is the key ingredient in real chocolate, fake has other oils like partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.(nasty)
1948 2018-02-05 19:34:59 Isn't CBD oil already legal? I don't know the details of this campaign, but I had assumed it was about how medical CBD was delivered by the health service, rather than its legality.
1949 2018-02-05 19:34:58 it is translated literally to bread with oil!!! maltese is a form of arabic i think or very similar idk
1950 2018-02-05 19:34:48 Ik oil

1954 2018-02-05 19:34:17 I hate it too  but we've had more than our share this year I want it GONE   ....PS:  Sick of paying heating oil bills too  lmaooo
1955 2018-02-05 19:34:15 #TheCloverfieldParadox sucked as a prequel/sequel. It would have been a better stand alone movie. So am I to assume that Rob the guy from the first movie got a promotion to Japan while the whole world was having oil wars. 
1956 2018-02-05 19:34:04 Higher wages, low unemployment, rising bond yields, rate normalization. Just what everyone wanted
1957 2018-02-05 19:34:01 I am not interested in your CBD oil  #pleasefrigoff
1958 2018-02-05 19:33:50 Working interest in oil wells can be phenomenal. Sanctions are cost the Russians millions per day.
1959 2018-02-05 19:33:48 I figured it out after 3 days  Used a syringe bulb to blow air into my ear canal and dislodge the oil.
1960 2018-02-05 19:33:31 His replacement just raised municipal taxes an average of 4.2% two months after election. People angry. Her party is very poli correct with strong NDP left-leanings.
Coderre rallied ~ 80 mayors against pipeline. So stupid. 
QC ppl were indifferent, wd likely prefer cheaper AB oil
1961 2018-02-05 19:33:31 Yeah. My face is struggling after using it in my oil mix for makeup remover. It makes my scalp itch too.
1962 2018-02-05 19:33:29 Did you run it to warm the oil up ?
1963 2018-02-05 19:33:26 It's even bigger than that - it's the sanctions on Russian oil they want lifted, which is why Rex Tillerson shows up from out of nowhere and becomes SoS (Exxon $$$).  Coincidence that he killed the dept that enforces/deals with sanctions?  Keep your eye on THOSE sanctions!
1964 2018-02-05 19:33:19 I don’t spread any. Not worth destroying important rainforests for stupid palm oil.
1965 2018-02-05 19:33:16 I can't stand pretty toes, pretty feet, pretty fingers, pretty hands, broke pocket men, who don't know hard work or even any kind of work men. Give me a dry, ashy, rough toes, feet, fingers, hands, knees and elbow working man any day, I will lotion and baby oil him.
1966 2018-02-05 19:33:07 oil smh
1967 2018-02-05 19:33:01 Skipping work to get my oil changed. Being an adult sucks

1970 2018-02-05 19:32:42 whoa i didn't say anything about leaking oil from trucks but no, i'm saying if you feel the need to kill animals under the clause of cultural values, then yea i think hunting is better because it actually is a cultural belief & at least you get food to feed your family out of it
1971 2018-02-05 19:32:32 Couldn't agree more @judyoliveoil and @tasteofthemed we need more healthy food products in our supermarkets to go with olive oil, not processed products!
1972 2018-02-05 19:32:20 I'm currently studying english vocabulary and terms for oil and gas industry and nothing makes sense any more
1973 2018-02-05 19:32:06 They don't if the person does them right & you can get some type of essential oil that helps keep them healthy

1980 2018-02-05 19:31:22 Both of them together were $3,000. You gotta think about the time and the cost of materials, especially the oil. Those were pretty dope paintings. If you don’t think they were worth that much then that’s you but she named her price and that’s that.
1981 2018-02-05 19:31:17 That’s why many Scots would like to take that route. Population similar. Norway had the sense to set up a social fund with oil money though. Scotland’s got squandered by various Westminster Governments.
1982 2018-02-05 19:31:06 What? First time i hear that 
1983 2018-02-05 19:30:55 @JustinTrudeau @CBCMorningLive Really?
You yahoos don’t give a dam about the environment.
You only want to serve your masters in big oil!!
Like how many pipelines did you approve?
1984 2018-02-05 19:30:50 My neighbor just rolled up in his new sub sti with an oil slick decal WTF
1985 2018-02-05 19:30:45 soybean oil ranks right up there with them.
1986 2018-02-05 19:30:41 Try coconut oil to get them off!
1987 2018-02-05 19:30:26 Mr M unaware that Scotland's tax revenues (esp oil & gas) go straight to Westminster.

I'm thinking he was the go-between to that Gazprom oil deal we hear whispers about - the one that needed sanctions to be lifted to go forward
1992 2018-02-05 19:29:59 love this body oil

1998 2018-02-05 19:29:39 Grapessed oil for cooking instead.
Cooks cleaner.
Use the coconut oil for your hair and skin and oil-pulling.
Or to wet your food. I don't cook with at all.
1999 2018-02-05 19:29:33 Agree. Lived in Alberta for quite a few years. They somehow think the conservatives will fix the oil prices.
2000 2018-02-05 19:29:12 Sure -- the oil market is going to lie down and give free oil to Prepa. The lack of intelligence here is remarkable.
2001 2018-02-05 19:29:04 fire place going with essential oil diffuser set with a soft glow or purple LED light... we really living up to our lesbian name
2002 2018-02-05 19:29:01 Many years ago I acted for a person who had their boots filled with boiling oil from a deep fat chicken fryer at a fast food place. Nylon socks!!! I can still see the pics in my mind as if it was yesterday.

2010 2018-02-05 19:28:08 I'm yet to understand how some one lays  claim  to an oil  well. And the country pays him  for what  is in its territory. Mother earth  monetized?

2016 2018-02-05 19:27:32 Deola pls permit to object. Resources aren't diminishing. It is crude oil that's diminishing. Our rising population isn't a worry. It's our rising corruption that should be of concern. Let's fight the root causes sir. There's no mountain too high my brother. You just need faith.
2017 2018-02-05 19:27:20 I Don't Like To Pay For Oil. ! ?
2018 2018-02-05 19:27:19 Hell yes... less oil less coal.
2019 2018-02-05 19:27:18 We are walking on dangerous ground. There is investigative reporters who are looking at Facts not fiction. Soros is funding McCain on Oil speculations in the Balkans. We have a Coup coming. Warning signs that no one is paying attention to. We have become the British Empire
2020 2018-02-05 19:27:14 That's a bizarre take on what actually happened. Heath attempted to push investment via CCC policy initially creating a housing and consumer spending boom, private debt mounted as a result. Add in the OPEC oil crisis inflating additional prices and people simply couldn't keep up.
2021 2018-02-05 19:27:10 That's not a fair comparison (smoking tobacco=oil), and notion that China India etc will suddenly go off-oil is ludicrous; even after 3rd world is electrified w clean power there will still be huge demand for hydrocarbons, petrochems eg in plastics, long-distance trucking #bcpoli

2033 2018-02-05 19:25:19 oil spillage cost you?
2034 2018-02-05 19:25:15 My grandpa walked into my room and literally jumped a foot in the air cause I was messing with my George HW toy @madisonbraden14 and @RealDiegoLozada got me and it talks and he was not anticipating HW talking about oil when he walked in my room
2035 2018-02-05 19:25:12 Sh!!!  Your ridiculousness is showing.  Capitalism will work with other sources of energy and in different lines of work not just the oil and coal industry.
2036 2018-02-05 19:25:04 In the heady days of $100 oil, the revenues were 10-15Bn...now it is $70... Perhaps someone needs to do a report on O&G Industry/Treasury Taxation Mismanagement...Have they started Taxing BP & RDShell yet?
2037 2018-02-05 19:25:03 I love oregano oil (not exactly the smell tho lol) I actually have several Essential oils I like to use and I sell too...
2038 2018-02-05 19:25:03 wind is cheaper without the battery/storage cost. if you add storage cost, it will more expensive than coal. coal, oil, gas, don't have storage costs. the electricity is always available

2048 2018-02-05 19:24:07 my cat knocked my hair oil off my desk and onto my desk chair, aka her bed, and cuddled with the bottle and ended up opening it. now my cat smells like starbursts and my desk chair has a giant oil stain.
2049 2018-02-05 19:24:02 it doesn't make sense because it would mean a gigantic amount of scientists all around the worlds are all nefariously engaging in misleading the public. What is more likely, that this is the case or that a minority of scientist are being bought off by the oil industry?
2050 2018-02-05 19:23:36 Wouldn't it be better for activists to stop using oil for good? This would significantly reduce the need to produce more of the stuff.
2051 2018-02-05 19:23:35 I went to a friend's house for a Super Bowl party and had  a blast! I wore a curly ponytail with a little @oyinhandmade Honey Hemp Conditioner, @fcanaturals Invigorating Oil, and Xtreme Wetline gel. This combination has turned out to be a perfect combination. What abt your curls?

2055 2018-02-05 19:22:31 Saudi Arabia seems to be heavily involved on this front. Apparently they are taking this direction to diversify away from oil. I think the may concern is that it is very expensive. Haha although can you put a price on widespread deaths due to dehydration?
2056 2018-02-05 19:22:22 I have came to a conclusion that our current state legislature and governor will not do what needs to be done. (Income tax, raise in oil taxes)

It falls on deaf ears when you call in, write, or tweet. 

They go through the motions... yet no change. 1/
2057 2018-02-05 19:22:15 start w/corporate greed. saying this stuff doesn't mean anything if you aren't going to take on the main problem. people turn to hate from lack of education & living in poverty. talk to unions, take on the oil industry. unapologeticly! people want a movement! #ParadisePapers

2076 2018-02-05 19:19:17 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
2077 2018-02-05 19:19:15 Have y'all ever tried to buy Olive oil before?? These prices are wiiillldd
2078 2018-02-05 19:19:08 My mom will buy me a $300 purse (don’t need) but will make me buy my own oil for an oil change (need). Like what 
2079 2018-02-05 19:18:56 Thatcher supported Saddam in war against Iran and sent Xmas cards to him and Gaddafi. Backed Golda Meir, visited dictator Shah of Iran and supported Pinochet. Don't get me started on Cameron. Oil rich states
2080 2018-02-05 19:18:55 I am writing a chapter on sandalwood oil on invitation from Zagazig University Egypt Professor who is editing a book "Fruits Oil: Chemistry and Functionality". This will be my 10th authored chapter in international journal of Springer 2018.
2081 2018-02-05 19:18:33 I'm ditching Oreos for life until they stop using Palm Oil 
@Oreo
2082 2018-02-05 19:18:08 The minivan I drive for work is 400 miles overdue for an oil change & while it’s not my responsibility I’m really tired of ALL the notifications that maintenance is due.
2083 2018-02-05 19:18:05 getting your oil changed tricky. you could find out you need a new motor or your air filters going out 
2084 2018-02-05 19:18:05 [8:17PM] @GiditrafficTeam: Migrating from WORLD OIL FILLING STATION to JAKANDE LEKKI is a slow and steady traffic @Gidi_Traffic #GIDITRAFFIC
2085 2018-02-05 19:17:57 Do you have any mineral oil? You can heat it under the hot tap and put a few drops in. That usually helps mine. Any form of gentle heat seems to soothe...
2086 2018-02-05 19:17:54 Woke up
Said thanks
Its a miracle I'm alive
I drank water
Took meds
Talked to a friend

2087 2018-02-05 19:17:53 A drop of olive oil and lemon juice to an ice cube then running it over your face gives you better results than some most skin care products
2088 2018-02-05 19:17:43 Not my style! One example are the oil companies. Did not see any facts to disprove my statement,  just name calling!
2089 2018-02-05 19:17:40 .@AmbMacNaughton: Since 1994 Canada has gone from being source of 14% of US #oil imports to being source of more than 40% #insights2018

2091 2018-02-05 19:17:18 Superb... enjoy lovely lady you deserve it 
2092 2018-02-05 19:17:17 I broke my wrist in RVN in a poorly executed landing away from base. They put me to good use carrying oil samples from II Corps to Saigon weekly. The Air Force felt sorry for me and took me with them to Bangkok each week. Good use of an aviator that couldn't meet standards.
2093 2018-02-05 19:17:14 Yep...among other things I have an oil leak even tho my head gaskets were redone last year and my catalytic converter needs replacing (whatever that is!)
2094 2018-02-05 19:17:06 With all those decades of OIL prosperity and it's still a banana republic turd world shithole country. LMAO HAHAHAHA
2095 2018-02-05 19:17:01 TRUE, how about Wall Street, Oil, Coal, and Payday lenders WRITING legislation WORD for WORD for @gop representatives. This is mASSIVE #ConflictofInterest #Swampinaction all about political $$s, not citizens

2099 2018-02-05 19:16:32 Coastal businesses and governor @GovInslee to speak out against offshore drilling in WA later today, following a President @realDonaldTrump announcement to drill for oil and gas in U.S. waters #waleg #uwoly
2100 2018-02-05 19:16:29 Agree with @AzStudies. Socio-eco situation will be the same, maybe in October even better due to higher oil prices. There is no political competition and there wouldn’t have been any until October.
2101 2018-02-05 19:16:18 @WhiteHouse @PressSec What tax cuts mean to American workers on the middle class:  $1.50 a week.  What tax cuts mean to trump and his family of takers: $11,000,000.  BS populism from a BS snake oil salesman.
2102 2018-02-05 19:16:11 If I understood this correctly, in order from most to least "clean", it goes natural gas, oil, and then coal. #Coal #Oil #NaturalGas
2103 2018-02-05 19:16:08 Nothing a little coconut oil can’t clear up! I’m so glad this helped distract you a little bit, love 
2104 2018-02-05 19:15:50 By their nature, all cooking oils are refined.  Only unrefined O6 is in context of whole foods (nuts, seeds, nut butters, avocado, olive oil, meat).  I would assume the latter is much healthier than the former.
2105 2018-02-05 19:15:48 #US stock slide deepens, #USD, #Gold advance! Energy and financial shares weigh down indexes; #oil declines; #treasury yields give up gains; key German, British bonds rally!

2107 2018-02-05 19:15:24 McDs fries are par cooked before they go to the outlets. 
They have 17 ingredients, including milk, beef & wheat.
They may taste good but they are terribly unhealthy.
Fries should be potato, oil & salt, nothing more.
2108 2018-02-05 19:15:21 Palm oil is such a massive issue and its EVERYWHERE! Currently working on an assignment all about palm oil in the UK for biofuels... #palmoil
2109 2018-02-05 19:15:13 There is not. Instead, we use strengthening ingredients like biotin, argan oil, and algae extract in the DDR line, making it vegan! For keratin protein check our Curl Charisma Collection!
2110 2018-02-05 19:14:47 No resources per se just my network. I also like $ESV but most of the offshore drillers will do well I think. Did you read the recent Goehring & Rozencwajg quarterly report. They are calling for $100 oil in 2018. These guys have been pretty good on their calls.
2111 2018-02-05 19:14:40 Give me that hot oil treatment in my beard while we sip henny and watch the knicks type love.
2112 2018-02-05 19:14:40 Meanwhile, back in the U.S.A.,energy, and financial shares weigh down indexes. We slash our precious National monuments, and parks and open them up  to oil, gas, and mineral exploration, without fixing the hundreds of abandoned mines and wells.
2113 2018-02-05 19:14:30 So if I have oily skin and I use an oil as a moisturizer is that like... a bad thing? Help.
2114 2018-02-05 19:14:14 Straight coconut oil, or baby lotion!
2115 2018-02-05 19:14:12 Yes, it's stunning how many Cdns have naively been duped by the USA funded anti cdn oil special interest groups.  They really should focus their efforts on Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq...
2116 2018-02-05 19:14:12 Hey Don, the Dutch spent their windfall from oil on setting up a NHS based on British one! Check with them to see how it went!?
2117 2018-02-05 19:14:09 any crisp you like as long as it uses a standardised spud and industrial vegetable oil
2118 2018-02-05 19:13:56 Looks like my asthma has returned and my damned puffer is nowhere in sight. Grateful that my neighbour made me an oil blend to help with breathing while I wait to hear back from my doc.

2140 2018-02-05 19:10:01 It is SCOTLAND'S OIL and no amount of braying & huffing & puffing by English Tory windbags like Billy Boy Cash nor wishful thinking by the Express rag will change that fact.

2142 2018-02-05 19:09:58 I understand totally and would support an informed decision to turn down chemo.

My issues is people who are uninformed and panicking may make bad decisions due to the claims made by a website claiming cannabis oil can simply cure cancer.

All bases must be considered.

2151 2018-02-05 19:09:15 This isn't unique among John Deere. Caterpillar, others all have the same story wanting to sell you oil/filters/consumables but you can get those from other places. Software updates/troubleshooting info, not so much. Cars at least have a mild standard and you can read OBD2 info.
2152 2018-02-05 19:09:11 yeah. heat a little olive oil 2 where it’s lukewarm. drop 2-3 drops into ur ear & place a little cotton wool in after so it don’t pour out. keep ur head tilted 4 about 10 minutes then take it out & clean ur ear. it softens any wax/blockages. doesn’t work every time but still
2153 2018-02-05 19:09:08 Wow! #RebeckaMartinsson Black Path took the show to another level from the excellent opener. Characters really well developed. Strong storyline and stunning cinematography. @WalterPresents strikes oil again! @NordicNoirBuzz @4Viewers @All4
2154 2018-02-05 19:09:06 Looks like water in the air tank/airline possibly and it's spraying out when you primed. It could also be oil on the model repelling the paint.

2159 2018-02-05 19:08:20 To be honest, I don't think either side came out looking particularly good, and have been revealed as the snake oil salesmen they are. Unfortunately, the future is unknown, and people like to be scared.
2160 2018-02-05 19:08:08 your essential oil tweets are in my nightmares
2161 2018-02-05 19:08:04 Gee these essential oil cults are spreading.
2162 2018-02-05 19:07:42 Because our chili oil sauce really seeps into the noodles if you keep them overnight. If you stir the noodles when you order them fresh, they will have a little extra kick!

2172 2018-02-05 19:06:02 Getting my oil changed overhearing dudes discuss whether to spend a tax refund on a dirt bike or a riding lawnmower. Decisions decisions. Personally, I’m torn, the riding lawnmower is more practical but the dirt bike is better for the environment. Think I should add my 2 cents?
2173 2018-02-05 19:06:01 I don’t want oil in my gloves.  Ick.
2174 2018-02-05 19:06:01 So it is not shameful enough that we are like the 6th  producer of oil or use to be and still lack it but to beat the record of longest fuel scarcity is something to discuss. 

Short of words to describe this country.
2175 2018-02-05 19:05:40 We mainly use rapeseed oil but there is a very small amount of sustainable palm oil that’s been certified sustainable by the RSPO.

2177 2018-02-05 19:05:27 Looks like an article off 5 years ago. Same position just a lot less cash. They had £40 mill back then. They said they were going to buy loads of cheap assets off oil crashing it’s gone from $110 to $25 now $70 they missed it by looks of it.

2181 2018-02-05 19:04:43 Idc what anyone says oil popping on a pan is the scariest shit ever
2182 2018-02-05 19:04:17 An even more courageous step would be to stop all fossil fuel related research and innovation. Groups like @DataLabScotland are blessed with SO much choice as to where they invest resource, it's easy to leave oil & gas alone. #KeepItInTheGround cc @FutureARK @tommitchell_kic

2222 2018-02-05 18:59:02 I like small amounts of pickle juice, if its a really good pickle. Like stick my finger in the puddle on the plate kinda thing. Or sprinkling it on potato chips. But that's all, really. And I don't like olives at all (olive OIL is great tho, and pesto).
2223 2018-02-05 18:58:55 With people up in arms about "blood diamonds", where is the outrage over blood oil.
2224 2018-02-05 18:58:52 oh no, i was looking for the post about best/fave avocado oil products
2225 2018-02-05 18:58:51 Actually it does. Oil price inc & so did OFS $. Oil price dec & so did OFS but not back to where it was b/c technology costs more. Capex/CF sucked at $100 oil & sucks at $50. When exactly will profit accrue to producers?
2226 2018-02-05 18:58:49 Was Event Horizon the horror movie in space or the Mark Wahlberg film about an oil spill?
2227 2018-02-05 18:58:49 Idiots are running our country! Donald Duck friends(big oil,big gas,big banks, and Mari punk lago are bleeding us dry! Ruining the environment and not giving a shit about it!
2228 2018-02-05 18:58:29 There is a need to adopt and implement Zero Liquid Discharge especially for manufacturing/production, oil exploration companies & also farm tank owners in Lagos State as they use high volume of water and most of the untreated water or effluent are released to municipal waterways

2230 2018-02-05 18:58:13 Hey @altonbrown been reading some debates about what oil/lard to use to season cast iron skillets. Flaxseed oil seems to come up as the best. What is your take? I appreciate non-stick but I appreciate flavor more. Thoughts?
2231 2018-02-05 18:58:11 If you accept that tidewater access for oil is inevitable then I would rather it close to major clean up resources than up north
2232 2018-02-05 18:58:07 i just bought a coconut oil based nourishing mask for my hair and i feel the need to wash my hair right now even though i’m supposed to study
2233 2018-02-05 18:58:04 There's a recording of Trump announcing his foreign policy team including Carter Page and "George Papadopoulos. Energy and oil consultant, excellent guy."
2234 2018-02-05 18:58:04 One of the wealthiest Canadian provinces is presently under a Social Democratic government, the NDP, and last time I checked the citizens of Alberta are one of the least taxed provinces. Social programs are largely funded by Oil Industry revenues.
2235 2018-02-05 18:58:03 I am so sad i wasn’t born in the era of pocket watches, love letters, traveling by steam trains, reading by oil lamps and listening to music on a gramophone.

2238 2018-02-05 18:57:07 I find that a couple of drops of olbas oil in water, and inhaling the steam helps. 
(I use a face steamer).

2248 2018-02-05 18:55:39 When it comes to Josh Leivo and his trade request, if you are an Oiler fan you shouldn't be surprised to hear the #Oilers tossing their hat at him. He has been a player that has been rumored to head to the Oil for a while now and they could get him for cheaper with the request.
2249 2018-02-05 18:55:39 @DreDrexler just received Ocean Clay and the Oil Cleanser. Gotta say on the first use I am already blown away by Ocean Clay. Worth the price of admission haha
2250 2018-02-05 18:55:23 Don't forget, you can heat your home or business with #Bioheat, created right here in #portlandmaine at our #biorefinery for the same price as conventional heating oil. It burns the same as #2, and today's price is $2.75/gallon, or $2.70/g when you sign up for autofill!
2251 2018-02-05 18:55:22 Haha, yeah, that's the bin for used frying oil
2252 2018-02-05 18:55:14 Why is it the prices didn't come down when oil prices were down?

2254 2018-02-05 18:55:08 Dear Patriot fan friends, remember, we are not celebrating the Patriots loss because we dislike you or Boston or anything like that. Brady and Bellicheck are officious horrible pricks who rub shoulders with fascists and sell snake oil. We're thrilled those guys lost.
2255 2018-02-05 18:55:01 I’m going to claim we stole the third largest produce of oil in the world’s wealth and half million of its citizens murdered. Claim wtfever you want!

2262 2018-02-05 18:53:58 A local homeopath is found covered with truffle oil and mauled to death by a boar. Suspicion falls on the village witch, angry that researchers who don't understand how much this all means to the village might threaten to tell the vicar who his parents really are.
2263 2018-02-05 18:53:37 Was speaking with an environmentalist last night.  I didn't know that, in Canada, fully 80% of our carbon emissions are from our process of pulling oil out of the oil sands.

2267 2018-02-05 18:53:22 We have enough oil to last 400 years at current consumption rates! We have enough nuclear energy in the United States to power the world for a thousand years! 
We have enough coal to power the world for 250 years! Future Generations are going to be very well off!!! Lol

2275 2018-02-05 18:52:14 Outcomes would have been swift if they had oil...American Taxpayers are done supporting costly failed military ventures/excursions, hence congress pulled the plug which is why Obama shifted gears & changed strategy...

2277 2018-02-05 18:52:01 This is the recipe from my book. It should work better. Ingredients for gluten-free pasta for 4:

2285 2018-02-05 18:51:05 $TDW has some interesting longer term warrants that look interesting. If oil goes where I think it is going they could pay. Offshore service boats still has massive overcapacity but scrapping will pick up. Gotta track utilization rates. I'm long.
2286 2018-02-05 18:51:00 omgomg, i tried butternut squash last night. it was like pan fried w a little bit of oil and then all i did was put a small amount of salt & pepper and it was the best. i feel like that’d be hella good as a side

2299 2018-02-05 18:50:03 castor oil was a good jump start for me, used it with edges + eyebrows
2300 2018-02-05 18:50:01 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2301 2018-02-05 18:49:54 I recommend an electric oil filled radiator and one of those timer plugs with the fiddly little pin things. This is the system I use. Although I don’t bother with the fiddly little pins any more.
2302 2018-02-05 18:49:51 waiting for an oil change and I could write a book about the weird shit going down in this waiting room
2303 2018-02-05 18:49:49 Well, the Mad Max franchise was born out of exactly that fear of societal collapse. Recall the first movie, where Australian society was still struggling to avoid total chaos, set off by a shortage of oil and other non-renewables.
2304 2018-02-05 18:49:35 Definitely..exactly what did Scotland gain from our Oil under unionist rule?  Exactly 0.
2305 2018-02-05 18:49:34 The guy changing my oil yesterday said something to me and I laughed at him awkwardly and Jason looked at me after he walked away and said “don’t laugh at him he ain’t funny.... I am.”

2307 2018-02-05 18:49:12 But are publishers involved in Meta because they sit on the data (the scientific articles) or because they are so good at it?

It would also be nice if oil firm became energy firms producing renewable energy, that would ease the transition. In praxis it is a different job.
2308 2018-02-05 18:49:01 No OIL, No LIFE!!!

2312 2018-02-05 18:48:46 Mum asked her Google home to add cooking oil to her shopping list and she replied saying “ok, adding cocaine to your shopping list”
2313 2018-02-05 18:48:34 My whole mouth is numb thanks to the clove oil.

2318 2018-02-05 18:48:05 Not sure but I would think any oil would burn.
2319 2018-02-05 18:48:01 paying 67$ for an oil change makes me want to sell my car and buy a pos car i don’t need to take care of any offers pls
2320 2018-02-05 18:47:59 Oh right, same over here. Do you know how much your friends pay per litre of oil?
2321 2018-02-05 18:47:57 But again it wont cause theres no oil.
2322 2018-02-05 18:47:39 Dammit!!

Also me: why does this dark lipstick look like I smeared motor oil on my face
2326 2018-02-05 18:47:01 Afghanistan was not won because of the strategy of fighting two wars in 2 different countries/theatres. Divided energy, divided focus resulting in prolonged conflict causing Loss of political = reduced congressional funding. Another reason - Afghans have no oil...
2327 2018-02-05 18:46:38 Spent the morning getting the trucks oil changed! Got a recommendation to fix crap that my truck needs! Ughhhh!!!!

2331 2018-02-05 18:46:28 No eating too  much  meat, oil, seafood. Better  than  eat vegetables  and fruits  for  the  good health to avoid  cancer.
2332 2018-02-05 18:46:16 If you store the jar upside down, the oil should separate out at the bottom of the jar, if that's the problem! :)
2333 2018-02-05 18:46:12 I just seen the hottest oilfield girl of my life She had on overalls and everything, still looked like a snack that fell in some oil
2334 2018-02-05 18:46:12 The pipeline will help reduce costs and environment damage by reducing the amount of train and truck transportation for the oil

2337 2018-02-05 18:46:03 Oil Prices neared their lowest in a month as rising U.S. output and a weaker physical market added to the pressure from a widespread decline across equities and commodities.
2338 2018-02-05 18:45:36 tell me more? I thought mineral oil was a harmful ingredient?
2339 2018-02-05 18:45:35 When those critiquing it are using tropes as opposed to asking why, then we have people whom have no valid opinion and just seek to pour oil on the flames. I'm from the North, I know why people here voted leave and it wasn't "Johnny Foreigner", some voted because they felt the~

2349 2018-02-05 18:43:51 Hopefully. Not sure about my skin though. I seem to have got roscasea somehow and it's constantly red and dry. Even bio oil is no help to me. Must go see a dermatologist or something.
2350 2018-02-05 18:43:42 It's an unfortunately named plant (its seeds can be pressed to make oil). At least, that's what I'm hoping Aristotle meant...
2351 2018-02-05 18:43:41 @HIGH_TIMES_Mag ACDC? Come in gummies or oil?
2352 2018-02-05 18:43:22 "The grooviest and phoniest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even pursued - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
2353 2018-02-05 18:43:20 I know it’s bad when I go to check my oil, and I wipe the thing off with a napkin to see where the line is at... and the napkin stayed clean. Bc I have absolutely no oil in my car 
2354 2018-02-05 18:42:51 You can add CBD oil or CBD isolate to beauty products.
2355 2018-02-05 18:42:48 Wait? Jimboman watching movies? That only means one thing.....Bulls are screwed :)
2356 2018-02-05 18:42:43 The"esprit motard" is long gone.   When I started riding leathers cost a fortune, oil skins and open face helmets were the norm. People didn't pass their time knocking others for the equipment they wore, the bike they rode. We accepted that others as they were. a community.
2357 2018-02-05 18:42:33 The fact that a chemical is used to make fries at all is disturbing,  fries should be 3 ingredients shouldn't they?  Potatoes, oil and salt?  Good ingredients and ya get good food?
2358 2018-02-05 18:42:26 yay i got to switch my painting class from acrylic to oil :))
2359 2018-02-05 18:42:01 US actually did not retain direct control of Iraq's oil fields, but Israel sure benefited from our fake WMD war on Iraq; same neocons & zionists now pushing was on Iran & its proxies like Hezbollah.
2360 2018-02-05 18:41:55 Hmmm an actual country or:

A country where they can’t speak properly
A country where they’ve just gotten lucky with oil
Some shithole next to Russia

2363 2018-02-05 18:41:49 I’m reviewing this Argan oil & I used it on my wig last night, straightened the hair & my hair looks amazingggg so silky compared to how it was looking before
2364 2018-02-05 18:41:11 Drinking Strawberry Mirinda is much like drinking 2-stroke oil..... #yummy
2365 2018-02-05 18:41:01 Not very! Unless it's a day when the oil guys are coming home!
2366 2018-02-05 18:40:52 So today, found out the oil leak I had on Xmas Day from my outside boiler has gone under my house so will have to have the kitchen, dining room, living room & conservatory all dug up..... anyone got a spare room !?!
2367 2018-02-05 18:40:51 @realDonaldTrump 
The President of the United States: I ask you not to continue buying Venezuelan oil or selling its derivatives to the dictatorship that reigns in Venezuela, because that money that enters the country is stolen by the dictatorship and you contribute with that.
2368 2018-02-05 18:40:49 Getting an oil change, an inspection, and a title change in the same day is the financial pits. Don't be like me, kids.
2369 2018-02-05 18:40:42 Day 5 of #extremehealthchallenge  Turning junk food into health food!  This worked out considering we made healthy cupcakes yesterday! Gluten free. Organic. Coconut oil. Cacao. Etc. We will continue hearing healthy today. Another easy one,since we already do!
2370 2018-02-05 18:40:40 breath smell like takis and motor oil
2371 2018-02-05 18:40:32 The popcorn was so much better when it was Sundance. Now it's just buckets of styrofoam covered in oil.
2372 2018-02-05 18:40:26 Why should we even bother, if @EPAScottPruitt has all the power and policies to let big oil/coal/chem/gas/farming destroy the environment anyway?

2376 2018-02-05 18:40:09 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
2377 2018-02-05 18:40:09 Same here. I swear by Aveeno Eczema cream (and their regular lotion) and First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream. At night slather one of them on hands in combo with Vaseline or coconut oil and cover in white cotton gloves.
2378 2018-02-05 18:40:05 What’s a good oil free foundation for sensitive skin? I have eczema and I’m want to try something new!
2379 2018-02-05 18:40:04 I think they do that for prevention in case the car suddenly starts drinking more oil. But i am not a car expert. "Shrugs" :p

2388 2018-02-05 18:38:48 just like the strategic oil reserve is a kid in it for the lulz; so they did g2 and appear Russian.
2389 2018-02-05 18:38:48 Yeah, but you're not going to get people excited about that. Love him or hate him, Trumps snake oil pandering might not have had anything behind it, but it sure as fuck got people talking. Imagine what we could do if we could get people excited about actual doable good things?
2390 2018-02-05 18:38:45 Luckily that is irrelevant because we have a mandate for #indyref2 and can leave you Britain to your nasty Brexit without our oil, whisky or salmon to keep your currency afloat. Unless we decide to let you use our Sterling too.
2391 2018-02-05 18:38:28 Coconut oil in my coffee, let's see what's poppin
2392 2018-02-05 18:38:22 Oil scenes are a favorite
2393 2018-02-05 18:38:17 Getting my oil changed. Forgot that it took this long to do. So board. And forgot phone charger. #FML #board #oilchange
2394 2018-02-05 18:38:15 Bros If this government isn’t ready to fully deregulate pms product or bring back subsidy scheme, rest assured to continue battling with this menace until price of crude oil drops to $30-40 in the international market.
2395 2018-02-05 18:38:07 Man, I’d understand if they were performing mechanical work but it’s oil and an oil filter dude.
It’s the convenience.
Luckily I’m in a fleet vehicle today so they don’t ask me shit. But yea. Scam.
2396 2018-02-05 18:38:05 I never thought of that Empty & I think you’re right.

2399 2018-02-05 18:37:51 Goldman lol …. always pays to go against their call on crude oil. #OOTT #WTI #Brent
2400 2018-02-05 18:37:31 Nothing better than a fresh oil change 
2401 2018-02-05 18:37:25 depends on the type of oil. could be healthy. but they also add MSG, so idk /: açaí bowls have tons of sugar. it’s tough to compare
2402 2018-02-05 18:37:11 Passing the parked crude oil tank cars in Newark DE reminds me of the time I couldn't get oil train documents from MD and DE. Filed a #FOIA with Amtrak, and a week later, had even more detail than the states withheld.
2403 2018-02-05 18:37:11 @DJdrHEX $20 on the OIL, $20 on the ISLE tonight... YOU'RE WELCOME... #OddsAgainstMe #dowehaveaDeal
2404 2018-02-05 18:36:54 isn't pepsico still using palm oil to make doritos? can we focus on that instead of or even in addition to this new weird marketing scheme?
2405 2018-02-05 18:36:23 it's not an IF, it's a WHEN a major spill happens, will Albertans gladly give their hard-earned oil $$ for a coastal clean up? NO PIPELINE!!!
2406 2018-02-05 18:36:13 They tried to bill me $45 for an oil change I just laughed and said I'll do it myself, mechanics the biggest scammers

2408 2018-02-05 18:35:58 Haha, yes they look lovely. Was fine when oil was 8p a litre back in 2002.
2409 2018-02-05 18:35:50 Lmfao  .... just put the castor oil in the roots and on baby hairs and coconut oil in the rest of ur hair my hair is never super tangly anymore lol
2410 2018-02-05 18:35:34 This is lousy science reporting. It's a widely-used food and consumer product additive (used as an anti-foaming agent in cooking oil, and only existing at 10 parts/million in any finished food product), being used to improve existing stem cell process for creating new follicles.

2413 2018-02-05 18:35:15 @realDonaldTrump Time to run the snake oil salesmen & his family out of town. You sold out your country to become President, a job you are horrendously unqualified for. You're a disgrace & should be ashamed of your raw greed. #ImpeachTrump
2414 2018-02-05 18:35:07 It feel odd to know that we are only using a little bit of the crude oil and end up losing more than half of it. #SankeyDiagram #Lesson4
2415 2018-02-05 18:35:02 Spending my lunch break getting my oil changed
2416 2018-02-05 18:34:38 olive oil is acc the best moisturiser my mum was right all of these years
2417 2018-02-05 18:34:38 Make sure you oil or butter your knife though
2418 2018-02-05 18:34:27 With you all the way in that anger! Surely the truth has to stick at some point? I keep living in hope that people will wake up to the snake oil salesmen before it’s too late.
2419 2018-02-05 18:34:27 I’ll start working on it . Time to hit some stairs and chug some caster oil .
2420 2018-02-05 18:34:14 And Argan oil

2422 2018-02-05 18:33:52 Need to dig deeper into quid pro quo. At the bottom, essentially, Putin is killing off dissenters, Magnitsky was merely one of many who had evidence of his wrongdoing and various crimes. HRC would have put Putin on Int'l Terrorist Watch and Human Rights violations---no oil deal.
2423 2018-02-05 18:33:47 Was the jacket Timberlake was wearing the same one he wears to change the oil in his car?
2424 2018-02-05 18:33:46 Oil him! 
2425 2018-02-05 18:33:42 Cocoanut oil too,  very gentle and full of vitamin E
2426 2018-02-05 18:33:39 I was watching a a old flick..Brainstorm..  Anyway this was expected..sooner or later..just like the Patriots had to lose..no matter how hard they tried till the very end:)
2427 2018-02-05 18:33:35 Nailed oil & stocks direction, but only got play in oil :(
2428 2018-02-05 18:33:29 May not completely go away but a full bottle of water (drink it all immediately) and sleep in a completely dark room with a cool towel over your head. That eases mine. Also rub lavender oil and peppermint oil on your temples.

2432 2018-02-05 18:33:20 Comb hair faraway from your face – Your hair contains oil and may begin acne breakout. Wash locks daily and after exercise.
2433 2018-02-05 18:33:14 MLW my love next to me is literally spoon-feeding her vagina with coconut oil in order ro lubricate it adequately for dilation.
2434 2018-02-05 18:33:12 2/ Alberta has cheaper/faster shale plays - Montney and Duvernay - where investment has been heading. I think Fort Hills might be the last new oil sands projects as long as the world is drowning in oil.

She tried every holistic treatment going, including cannabis oil at an early stage in the cancer.

She lasted 2 years.

2436 2018-02-05 18:33:02 Has everyone seen the Russian Television interview of Carter Page from December, 2016 . He brags about have traveled between the U.S. and Russia for 25 years , studying and working in the Oil Speculation Industry . He also states he lived in Russia from 2004 to 2007 .

2439 2018-02-05 18:32:37 I think by electrifying the transport less oil money will go to states which are awash with dirty petrol money that will mean less money for terrorists
2440 2018-02-05 18:32:32 You know the squeaky wheel gets oil first. I wonder what YOU are trying to cover up. #YOUBEHINDSOMETHINGBAD
2441 2018-02-05 18:32:28 I'm a firm believer in cooking with grapeseed oil. I used to stan olive oil but times have changed.
2442 2018-02-05 18:32:28 I have an old oil one, damn expensive to run and maintain!
2443 2018-02-05 18:32:26 When u know u should be living it up in Cali building your dreams but have no idea how to get there so u sit in Indiana in a dead mall waiting for your oil to be changed and dreaming of a better life

2445 2018-02-05 18:32:19 Thanks for pointing him out. I think I found a new customer for snake oil. It does treat everyone equally.
2446 2018-02-05 18:32:07 Delicious palm oil 
2447 2018-02-05 18:32:03 I didn’t claim that the entire world has stopped accepting USD as payment, but CB’s have stopped accumulating USD fX reserves. Several countries are conducting trade outside of the dollar system. Also chinas Yuan/gold back oil futures should be a clear sign to us.
2448 2018-02-05 18:31:51 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.

2455 2018-02-05 18:31:12 Some will argue that rising oil and gas prices should mean higher taxes.  Of course, oil and gas companies will argue the opposite, says @joewertz. #okleg #OKSOTS
2456 2018-02-05 18:31:07 Very close to closing Oil,Dow and S&P shorts here. Think its time for a temporary bounce. Looking 63.30/25k & 2716 levels to cover and go Long. Using tight stop losses just in case Vix carries on higher
2457 2018-02-05 18:31:05 Jarrett, the oil industry itself invented fracking and horizontal drilling and other more efficient and cheaper ways of getting at oil and gas. With the global supply glut, bitumen is more or less at the bottom of the desirability list. Big, expensive, long-term projects. /2
2458 2018-02-05 18:31:03 Thing is, Norway like other northern countries takes care of its social system and uses the oil money to pay for.

2464 2018-02-05 18:30:38 Alaskans own 1,715,376 shares of TULLOW OIL PLC, worth $5,019,281. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED KINGDOM.
2465 2018-02-05 18:30:35 Since your google seems to be down or something... activated charcoal purifies toxins in your skin so sucks oil and impurities out of your pores. For teeth it scrubs plaque and tarter so whitens your teeth.

2474 2018-02-05 18:29:28 Can anyone recommend a good oil painting artist  preferably in the Sheffield or surrounding area please.
Please RT.
2475 2018-02-05 18:29:24 @morningmika While we are riled up on memo gate Trump is selling oil drilling leases. Selling off our public lands. About to devastate our oceans. Cutting support for alternative energy.  Putting tariffs on solar. Ending support for endangered species.  Please cover these now
2476 2018-02-05 18:29:20 The market will decide that. If the oil industry has produced better prospects for its capital investment, then that will happen as a natural consequence of market forces. And, to a point, that is already happening (shale). For how long, who knows...
2477 2018-02-05 18:29:04 You mean like communist China,  the Soviet Union, GDR or - god help us - oil rich Venezuela ? And don’t say “ mainstream EU social democracy “ - it’s just not true
2478 2018-02-05 18:29:03 @realDonaldTrump Pack the leaky jars of snake oil into the carpet bag and crawl back to your '0ne meelion dollar' sandpits.
2479 2018-02-05 18:28:57 And oil went from $35 to $100. Also not considering production levels. Doesn’t support your point at all that servicers will suck up all the profits. They will get a bite (disproportionately for bottlenecks like frack sand), but overall majority will accrue to US producers
2480 2018-02-05 18:28:45 $BTC.X   Snake oil salesmen doesn’t have guts to buy here, Back to ZERO
2481 2018-02-05 18:28:41 @jamieoliver quick question, to make any of the 30 minute meals is the trick to basically get something out the fridge, drown it in olive oil then add sea salt , pepper and lemon ?? #chefdepartie

2485 2018-02-05 18:28:00 Cannabis is the latin name, hemp the english one.  The official names vary a bit. So the oil is known as Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil but if you hydrogenate it, it is Hydrogenated Hemp Seed Oil.  I choose to find the inconsistency charming and eccentric.

Sir,
Nigeria is blessed with- and is a major exporter of- crude oil.

You're the PRESIDENT of Nigeria AND the MINISTER of Petroleum Resources.

Why is there continued fuel scarcity, sir?

2525 2018-02-05 18:22:08 As many olive branches as I’ve extended in the last 5 years I should have the highest quality extra virgin olive oil ever made

2531 2018-02-05 18:20:53 man, i hate when someone gets one pimple and says, “my acne is so bad,” or “my face is so broke out,” like some of us are really out here struggling w acne. if you don’t put some tea tree oil on that and keep it moving 
2532 2018-02-05 18:20:31 Oh I’m so sorry for both of you . Yes it would.  It is the most scientifically studied plant and has proven to help pain, depression, anxiety & so much more.  You might check into CBD oil that has no THC in it for him-not knowing what state you are in-but it would help him.
2533 2018-02-05 18:19:59 @DavidGranieri Hello, I'm a journalist for the Olive Oil Times and I'm writing an article about the €40 million increase in exports to China in 2017. May I send you or someone from Unaprol some questions about this topic? Thanks.
2534 2018-02-05 18:19:56 ever since i got this car i dread oil changes bc something is wrong with my car every fucking time (:
2535 2018-02-05 18:19:49 You reach a new level of anxiety when you see the mechanic come back after just asking for an oil change
2536 2018-02-05 18:19:45 sustainable means that once they've cleared the rainforest they use the land for palm oil again and again, agreed I wouldn't buy the stuff though. It's like buying bubbly chocolate or dairy-lea; clever marketing to sell you less chocolate/ cheese for more money.

2549 2018-02-05 18:17:51 Sorry to hear that. Had you tried CBD oil for the pain? I don't have chronic shoulder pain but get regular aches due to kickboxing and BJJ and swear by resistance bands. Might be worth a try.
2550 2018-02-05 18:17:51 Mom layed hands on me and began to pray, she forgot her oil so she ran and got it and continued to pray and rebuke the sickness away from me.
2551 2018-02-05 18:17:49 Only because the coal, gas and oil industries keep it that way. If every US house had solar shingles we'd eliminate our dependence on them.
2552 2018-02-05 18:17:44 Second term Obama saw the Commodity slow bust of 2012-14 which hurt a lot of Red States and benefitted Blue state bounce back.  Look at real wages increase in 2015 is almost entirely oil and commodity drop that hurt Red States more.

2558 2018-02-05 18:16:20 Oh no, Claudia! It sounds like you learned this lesson the hard way. If you every get Peppermint Halo in your eye again, we recommend gently wiping it with a soft cloth and vegetable oil as it's difficult for water to remove essential oils!
2559 2018-02-05 18:15:49 Notice Big Oil is tanking hard today ...

You #MAGA loons are gonna love those higher gas prices. Sad.

2561 2018-02-05 18:15:38 Read Shale Oil as Snake Oil. I have more questions than this high mark you speak of that require answers.
2562 2018-02-05 18:15:37 Of course they oppose. Liberals are about stifling the economy, and oppose energy independence.

If the plan was to give the oil to illegals, governor moron would sign it today.
2563 2018-02-05 18:15:35 GREENPEACE recognizes that we are the best in class. If all other companies who use palm oil would act as responsibly as Ferrero, it would be a much better world!  #sustainablepalmoil is the only way forward!

2567 2018-02-05 18:14:53 what's problematic is that it is "all fats", including good ones, such as Olive Oil. Originally I had heard similar conclusions but I thought it was only about Fried Food (which I was avoiding already).

2604 2018-02-05 18:09:26 That expose on how contracted fuel bowsers that leave fuel corporation and they substitute black oil for the refined oil prior to dumping fuel at shed was crazy. Vehicle owners would be lambasting those fuel sheds for ruining their engines. No one blames the contractor.

2621 2018-02-05 18:06:32 Nakakahiya uy.
2622 2018-02-05 18:06:12 Oh c'mon Andy, you are a smart, educated man.... are you really trying to suggest that wind generation kills more birds than oil production-distribution? Good the you neuter your cats though!

2625 2018-02-05 18:05:18 @jackkorn it’s telling me there is something about oil we don’t know. Maybe the forecast is far too low?
2626 2018-02-05 18:05:18 #WorldNutellaDay if only it didn’t have palm oil in it 
2627 2018-02-05 18:05:11 The low price point and the return policy make it pretty risk neutral.  The only thing I bought that I did not end up using on my face was the Rose Hip Seed Oil.  Just a bit too heavy.  But I kept it and am using it as a cuticle/elbow oil for winter and it is great for that.
2628 2018-02-05 18:05:11 I love it but have stopped buying it because of the palm oil. I have made my own with hazelnuts and cacao
2629 2018-02-05 18:05:04 It was Anglo Iranian oil corporation, now BP. Mossesdegh overthrown, CIA used the rashidian brothers, started a coup. The USA gave kashani 10;000 to start up riot's etc he was a CIA asset.

2633 2018-02-05 18:04:26 Think the other worst is allowing oil tankers to come in bringing dirty oil across the oceans. Endangering not just the Oceans but the bunker fuel they use is noxious. Spills are destroying huge tracts of the ocean.
2634 2018-02-05 18:04:25 Took a break to check my oil level. Discovered snail shells around my engine case.
2635 2018-02-05 18:04:05 @oilfractals @Oil_Tradr You both are quiet amid a great breakdown? Did you all celebrate a bit too hard last night after the Patriots met their demise? :) Oil is looking really good :)
2636 2018-02-05 18:03:51 LMAO, hope that oil change gets you running without the knock from being a Russian Bot.

2639 2018-02-05 18:03:30 I mean, we’re just being economical here, see, what I’m burning right here? It’s bonafide eco friendly plastic. It’s already made of oil! It’s made to be burned, knowhatimean? One day is carries groceries, the next day it keeps me warm. It’s logic!
2640 2018-02-05 18:03:27 Love Lord O'Donnells simile of senior Tories as 'snake oil salesman's in their claims re Britain after Brexit. Funnier and probably more accurate than Lord Turnbull's claim that they are a bunch on Nazi propagandists! #lordstrikeback

2643 2018-02-05 18:02:49 2) All 3 provinces who lead the country in economic growth all have a carbon tax imposed. BC, AB, ON. Would have they without the tax? Possibly. But we know the sky isn't falling. It's awful that people are out of work. But why is the right not blaming the collapse in oil price?
2644 2018-02-05 18:02:47 Was the declining Crude Oil Price the most significant factor in reducing our fiscal deficit and high GDP growth rate since 2014?
2645 2018-02-05 18:02:46 I hate getting an oil change. They always make you feel guilty when you’ve done nothing wrong and they try to get you to do a bunch of unnecessary things. #nothanks

2660 2018-02-05 18:01:13 Treated my hair with coconut oil for the first time in a long time last night. Woke up with the best hair I’ve had in at least a year. Now I just need to get about 10 inches chopped off.

2682 2018-02-05 17:58:57 I’ve just been reminded of the time I found a can of Dr Pepper in the kitchen, got really gassed about it, drank it and my mother had filled it with used cooking oil  I can still taste it and it’s been like 4 years
2683 2018-02-05 17:58:45 the peeling scabby dry spot next to my mouth caused by too much tea tree oil is an accessory
2684 2018-02-05 17:58:33 Take away human choice & you got more legal BS on a the same plant as before Trudeau. Need to grow pansies next to the open bar at home, flaming up burgers for the kids? That years of hazardous cooking oil on the walls renting?

2686 2018-02-05 17:58:21 People over here complaining about the oil in this girl’s food- like, excuse me... that’s the flavoring, ya’ll!
2687 2018-02-05 17:58:15 they weren't so junk a month ago when they were up 30-50% from where I bought them,  and these are long-term holds, I check them quarterly. Energy stocks in general trading at multi-year lows relative to oil and can re-rate by 30% easily here without oil needing to even move.
2688 2018-02-05 17:58:11 Complete irresposibility! Tearing up streambeds, waterfalls and compromising watersheds. Shameful. Why not show how you can change your own oil & dump the old in the stream?

2690 2018-02-05 17:57:44 I love when Hillary said "what I meant by open borders is trading energy" LOL you mean like now, TODAY, cause we already do that, we ship oil gas and trade!!!! What a lie!
2691 2018-02-05 17:57:41 But the real issue is the meds for the flu I had made me constipated... until I finally took some olive oil.

2692 2018-02-05 17:57:32 This also works with the narrative that most people trust the scientific community, and more money is pouring in for these initiative than denial, which is a minority group financed by the oil industry which is already in decline.

2728 2018-02-05 17:51:38 Fracking does not require any chemicals. Good old steam is enough to do the job but oil companies are dumping toxic chemicals down wells instead of having to store or treat them, an expensive long term problem. So they’re poisoning our water supplies.

2738 2018-02-05 17:50:06 And how would you define shill? If an oil company gave millions to someone like the Sierra club to go stop Canada from building pipelines, would you consider the Sierra Club shills?

Opening up the oil production business in America is among the worst policies as far as Russia is concerned.

Tremendously destabilizing to them.

2891 2018-02-05 17:34:46 When you go to get an oil change & they tell you they’ll change your air filter for $60 but you know they’re $20 at Walmart. LOL no thanks. Yeah, I’m a chick, no, I’m not fucking stupid.
2892 2018-02-05 17:34:32 I hate when I add too much oil to my twistout because then it just feels weighed down and it isn’t super bouncy and juicy.

2901 2018-02-05 17:32:48 Belichick sabotaged the game to spite Tom and Kraft. Matt Patricia coached purposefully bad defense so that his players won't be as appealing and he can bring them to Detroit with him. The snake oil Tom used to heal his hand was too slippery and cause the strip sack.
2902 2018-02-05 17:32:36 Oil companies spill tons of oil.Pentagon cannot account 4 trillions n military spending.A few million is small change n comparison.This is why a mediator is needed 2 distribute d $.Because that's d only way 2 keep track of it. Oil companies cannot b trust 2 handle oil as well.

2911 2018-02-05 17:32:00 Vitamin supplements aren't that expensive. A banana, cauliflower, some carrots, broccoli and beans with rice won't break your bank either. Put some olive oil on them and some Provençal herbs and you will be fine. Farty but fine.
2912 2018-02-05 17:31:54 WM gets all Scotland’s oil revenue, Scotland gets a wee bit of it back through Barnett, and you think that’s a fair deal

2916 2018-02-05 17:31:32 C'mon man! I've pointed you in all the right directions all off-season. The Lucas Oil Racing TV package is the cure for missing Speed and I've been at all sorts of cool races that have had broadcasts! :)
2917 2018-02-05 17:31:26 Your map of future China-Russia geographic interaction tells a prescient story of years ahead, current joint oil&gas thrust a next phase, but w/China rels w/Russia useful for the time being, but not forever (maybe lasts during Putin's reign)
2918 2018-02-05 17:31:26 Larsson was exactly what I expected but a tad more physical.  I disagree on the credit front, as many used the turnaround for the reasoning away the value lost in the Hall deal. Again not on the player but certainly the narrative many used.
2919 2018-02-05 17:31:15 Someone doused my office with tea tree oil or something and it is giving me the worst headache.
2920 2018-02-05 17:31:12 Soo the cure to baldness May exist in McDonalds oil. LMAOOOOOO
2921 2018-02-05 17:31:11 I was just about overweight for my body type this time last year, and by july I was almost underweight. Highly recommend!!

Good foods - oats, chia seeds, sweet potatoes, blueberries, any meat, any fish, olive oil, butter, eggs, kale, brocolli, salad, olives - just avoid carbs!
2922 2018-02-05 17:31:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, or removal.

2924 2018-02-05 17:31:03 That’ll nae happen without independence...   Without the oil England would have big problems..
2925 2018-02-05 17:31:02 @ChrisCanty99 bring the castor oil in tomorrow. 
2926 2018-02-05 17:30:58 In a just Society we would do when Norway did and nationalize the people's oil Reserves and sell licenses to responsible companies and a fair price that benefits all the people!
2927 2018-02-05 17:30:56 It alway sucks ,air quality will never improve until we have true leaders in city and county government willing to address farming and oil company’s ..

2930 2018-02-05 17:30:37 Coming to billion to get my oil changed is like a mini high school reunion, I swear

2932 2018-02-05 17:30:15 And palm oil killing rainforest and animals and human beings just so we can have. Nutella.
2933 2018-02-05 17:30:07 Eh! Magic stuff! A drain on Scotland but a boon for the UK. How the BS written about failing oil just looks bloody stupid now
2934 2018-02-05 17:29:49 Disappointed... They pay 100% of direct tax. Have given up their subsidies, stood in queue for demonetization.. Continue to pay high taxes on oil and get no benefits . Not even health scheme..

2936 2018-02-05 17:29:42 @DBChirpy bs. Trump knows full well that’s not going to happen. He’s punishing states who’ve gone all in for solar. It’s all about his need for oil. Specifically Rosneft
2937 2018-02-05 17:29:38 What’s you have is your house is not nothing. GOD is interested in the pot of oil you call nothing. Your nothing is what’s GOD want to work with for your blessing
2938 2018-02-05 17:29:31 “the only time i’ve vaped is through an essential oil pen”
2939 2018-02-05 17:29:27 I don't disagree with you on that. It is a definite mistake by THAT guy. He wasn't the only one who didn't think it would hurt as hard as it did though, but it doesn't change the fact that it ended up being an error in judgement.
2940 2018-02-05 17:29:24 I’ve made some out of just a little honey, olive oil, raw sugar. Or i use my charcoal face scrub.
2941 2018-02-05 17:29:18 "SUPER BOOOOOOOOOOOOOWL" I shout, howling at a red, white and blue moon while firing an assault rifle in each hand and dancing on a Middle Eastern child's grave as crude oil sprays out of my nipples
2942 2018-02-05 17:29:01 Agreed. I have tried CBD oil and it does not help. I have smoked pot maybe 5 times in my life years ago and hate how it makes me feel. If it works for them, Great, but it doesn't work for everyone and that has been proven. Lets all work together for pain relief!
2943 2018-02-05 17:28:57 @autumnal_city where is that guy that scoffed at your oil idea???

2948 2018-02-05 17:28:09 Everytime I get a oil change the niggas that work here always know I don’t know shit about my car  if I needed a dude for anything this would be it. My dad took care of my cars in the past but now he barely be in Cleveland.
2949 2018-02-05 17:28:08 Trump doesn’t care about the Solar industry. He wants Coal and Oil jobs and he doesn’t care/know what the impact will be.
2950 2018-02-05 17:28:06 Should of gotten my oil changed weeks ago

2952 2018-02-05 17:27:52 Palm Oil is a No No if you have a bowel disease! It’s a hidden ingredient in lots of foods...save the Rain Forests. Read the Labels

2959 2018-02-05 17:27:10 so many months oil never gave a crap about the dollar. but this week it matters because our algo overlords tells us it does

2966 2018-02-05 17:26:18 exclusive oil change
2967 2018-02-05 17:26:12 data is the new oil
2968 2018-02-05 17:26:00 just learned that doritos have invented a ‘lady friendly crisp’ that isn’t as loud when it crunches. so instead of reducing plastic packaging n reducing use of palm oil that contributes to deforestation they’ve used science to try n make birds eat quieter. world’s actual gone mad
2969 2018-02-05 17:25:59 Come home from work tired, then sit down and relax while diffusing some lavender oil. The smell is wonderful. It is a great way to lift a burden from your shoulders. #yleo #yllavender
2970 2018-02-05 17:25:43 The last thing we need is a military intervention from you lot. Sorry but we don't have any oil. Btw remind me how you helped Iraq? Hopefully we can solve this issue alone. The only thing you should do is watch.
2971 2018-02-05 17:25:34 A great example is the energy/oil industry. Until very recently there was little investment into clean energy options because they didnt need to (and it would cost them to do so). Now as oil runs short they are being forced to change.
2972 2018-02-05 17:25:32 I just bought toner lah, sunscreen lah, lagi apetu, oil cleanser. Dengan harapan confident kelua tanpa make up. Baru apply sehari, dah rasa mcm omg! Lembutnya kulit. Ekekekeke kecam la kalau berani. Muka kau breakout nanti padan muka

2974 2018-02-05 17:25:19 #oil lod
2975 2018-02-05 17:25:15 Very surprised at the response by some to a harmless, humorous, Oil fans/media as a community, fun for all, not take selves too seriously, bonding ritual.  Especially given fun contrast to deep negativity in some Oil posts at times.
2976 2018-02-05 17:24:47 Are you using cooking oil again? 
2977 2018-02-05 17:24:41 Unless they can get oil profits out of it
2978 2018-02-05 17:24:39 I needed an oil change 3,000 miles ago
2979 2018-02-05 17:24:37 Yes believe in yourself,s. Just take a look at the republic of Ireland since independence there thriving even though they have no north sea oil. & there country was very poor when it happened .
2980 2018-02-05 17:24:31 ijooo maybe back then,very bad salty nd too much oil nd dry
2981 2018-02-05 17:24:21 Apparently the guy in charge of putting the roster together did.
2982 2018-02-05 17:24:20 i feel like everyone says its 'sustainable' but after watching documentaries on climate change its just shown how much of the rain forests are disappearing just to make the oil so idk

2984 2018-02-05 17:24:05 @onetoughnerd 

Michigan's future energy policy needs to get on this road now.
Hydrogen is going to be the basis for a revolution akin to hydrocarbons replacing whale oil or internal combustion replacing horses. 
Michigan is behind the curve
2985 2018-02-05 17:24:00 Lows of the day in oil. Stocks not far behind.
2986 2018-02-05 17:24:00 Oil?
2987 2018-02-05 17:23:46 However, I must say that I am puzzled by someone who claims to be a "deep ecologist," and yet going Far Right. The FR supported gutting the EPA, opening national parks to development, withdrawing from the Paris Climate Treaty, oil drilling in the Arctic Refuge. Deep ecology??
2988 2018-02-05 17:23:42 The Oilers have nowhere near a Victor Hedman. No offence to Nurse and Larsson who are fine.
2989 2018-02-05 17:23:38 #WorldNutellaDay @Han4ham02 @CxMccafferty @iloveperaIta I wonder if all these Nutella lovers know what palm oil is

2991 2018-02-05 17:23:32 Canada is one of the world's largest producers of oil and oil is such a big part of the US economy, rising oil prices tend to have a negative effect on the USD and a positive effect on the CAD. Here you have two nice correlations.”
2992 2018-02-05 17:23:30 Do you know that any other oil causes even more deforestation because it has a far lower yield? Best alternative for now is certified palm oil or even better organic palm oil. Did you know palm oil is in every soap, shampoo and cosmetic you use? Urge manufacturers to source well.
2993 2018-02-05 17:23:26 Pati mga pinagkakautangan mo sakin nag susumbong. Nu ba yarn.
2994 2018-02-05 17:23:23 Great Trade Setups AND Signals☆:
The USD/CAD is one of the three so-called “commodity pairs”, together with AUD/USD, NZD/USD. These pairs are highly correlated to commodity (especially oil) fluctuations.
2995 2018-02-05 17:23:20 Ask a Canadian. Universal Healthcare works. Now kindly sit in the corner and let Paul Ryan and the oil companies run our country like they have been since your sorry ass became president
2996 2018-02-05 17:23:09 The second motion calls upon the SU to support the ongoing RSC sustainability campaign, which encourages them to divest from oil company BP.
2997 2018-02-05 17:22:58 I dey church sir. Fasting started today. You should come around bro. Fasting with "bottles" of anointing oil.
2998 2018-02-05 17:22:57 That's why they had to put baby oil on all the poles 
2999 2018-02-05 17:22:45 Also Brian, I’m doing a 22/2 IF, so I take it that my daily protein intake (plus the residual carbs from veggies) can be eaten in one meal if I could? And as fats won’t spike insulin will it be okay to have say MCT/Coconut oil in coffee outside of that window? 
3000 2018-02-05 17:21:51 I told you to use that coconut oil
3001 2018-02-05 17:21:38 Getting my oil changed  I’m so fucking broke dog I need to file my taxes
3002 2018-02-05 17:21:33 They have to be diluted in a carrier oil. Lavender is one of the milder essential oils for skin but even then,direct application is not recommended.
3003 2018-02-05 17:21:28 While 16 million people call in to work today, I actually had the day off and get to spend it waiting in line for an oil change and grocery shopping
3004 2018-02-05 17:21:09 As Trey Gowdy said, Trump would be under investigation even if there was no Dossier, and he's on your side. Could you imagine if Trey was Democrat and said that, he would have been feathered and tarred and boiled in Oil

Agreed on missing out on Sekera, you can't remove those minutes and not replace them and hope for the same result.

3015 2018-02-05 17:19:49 LOL it's so funny to hear U accuse others of "misinformation" & "manipulation"

The oil industry is the worlds largest producer of misinformation propaganda & second only to big pharma with their political bribery

Calling all concerned Cdns "special interest grps" is disgraceful
3016 2018-02-05 17:19:44 We were the sick man of Europe because we were post industrial and knackered. Thatcher reformed services, curbed union power and we had North Sea oil.
We've contributed to the EU budget for every year since joining except one.
Another pro EU lie
3017 2018-02-05 17:19:43 Sorry I am going to call you out on this one, Nutella is stuffed full of palm oil. Now Nestlé claim Nutella only use sustainable RSPO palm oil  but many consider this crop grown on cleared land that predates registration. So not really deforestation free.

3026 2018-02-05 17:18:19 I would say so, because whenever I feel a burning sensation after a bad dump it works lmao. I have had bad cases of hemorrhoids from stress so if it can work for that then I’d give it a shot. I would use a mix of coconut oil and aloe vera if it’s specifically for burning
3027 2018-02-05 17:18:18 Vitamin E oil or rosehip

3155 2018-02-05 17:02:56 @SenGaryPeters  How long would you ignore an oil or coolant leak? One at our border? Seen what happens in the EU Countries when flooded with too many refugees? Not having some border control is asking for problems just like ignoring oil or coolant leaks! Something will break!

3176 2018-02-05 17:00:53 Maybe that’s the future Trump wants for the US with him pushing the coal industry as well as the oil industry.

3200 2018-02-05 16:59:07 NDP ran on stopping this project  and won, maybe stick Alberta politics. Maybe people need to talk about Alberta greed. How about adequately compensated BC for risk to thier coast. Move oil administration Jobs to BC, and integrate the industry so BC has stake?

3231 2018-02-05 16:56:05 That's kinda strange. Usually it's the other way around since diesel has road taxes applied.  

Did your hedge on oil prices by setting a price for the season with the heating dealer backfire? or do you need to find a better oil dealer.

3276 2018-02-05 16:52:10 @kymdouglas when you used rosemary & lavender oils, were they infused oils or essential oils? I assume infuses, based on the amount. If so, what was the base oil? Thanks!

3293 2018-02-05 16:49:37 @BarackObama Wasn’t there a time during your presidency where we were no longer supposed to be dependent on overseas oil. Is it because of Trump who is undoing everything that you were put together why we are still going down this path?

3310 2018-02-05 16:47:52 Argan oil also works really nicely. It's a lot lighter and has a good scent so I'd say use that instead. Pick it up from Winners/Marshalls, it's a lot cheaper there
3311 2018-02-05 16:47:47 Nel corso del 1985 il crude oil scende da 27 a 14$,e lí rimane stabile fino al 1993 oscillando fra 14 e 20$.
Nello stesso periodo la lira si rivaluta del 97%.
Ancora sicuro che la tua affermazione,valida solo nell'era del € stabile, sia valida anche in quella della lira sovrana?

3320 2018-02-05 16:46:23 Some of the oil produced in NEBC goes to Husky refinery in Pr. George. Big % of NG produced goes on Enbridge system to domestic users in Lower Mainland and US Northwest. Rest goes east to AB, then to US Midwest and Northwest. Propane etc being exported via rail to west coast.

3322 2018-02-05 16:46:20 I am so proud of BC and the NDP for standing up to big oil and this absurd pressure from Alberta. Oil is on its way out. Spend the absurd subsidies to retrain workers. This isn’t an attack on workers, this is a defence of our waters and our lands.
3323 2018-02-05 16:46:20 Or maybe there are just a lot of hateful rubes in Angrywhitemanistan who haven't yet figured out that the snake oil you've sold them won't cure their ills,

Hi.Based on your experience, do you think there is someone manipulating the prices of oil, or s&p500,nasdq,and Dow futures?I think they can control the prices and not based only on buyers and sellers. If there are too many buyers, sometimes the prices will still fall.

3543 2018-02-05 16:17:40 Hi @chigrl , I'm a finance student from India. I'm really passionate about crude oil trade. I've recently heard your podcast on "Chat with Traders", I wanna learn more about this industry! I'm looking for more opportunities to learn, please help me, how do I begin?
3544 2018-02-05 16:17:35 Have you ever started a gas engine that had been sitting for a long time, particularly one with a small oil leak? Well, that would describe me pretty well today during my first day at the gym.
3545 2018-02-05 16:17:32 New episode is up now! We had a kicking good time with this one. It really kicked ass! There were a lot of kicks in it. And also punches. And also Jason Statham shirtless rolling around in oil. Enjoy our breakdown of the original Transporter!

3547 2018-02-05 16:17:25 Hemp oil, hemp, and Raw milk. The government gets lobbied by companies that want to rip off consumers by selling what used to be readily available at pharmaceutical prices (hemp oil), or do not want healthy product competition (raw milk). The paid media defend these monopolies.
3548 2018-02-05 16:17:17 The KS legislature introduced a bill that would make CBD oil illegal.CBD oil is not psychoactive like THC & doesn't impair motor skills. Making it illegal is like saying we should make lidocaine & bupivicaine illegal b/c they are so closely related to cocaine. How ridiculous.

3655 2018-02-05 16:04:16 Fun Fact if you’re getting Synthetic Oil you can go way longer than 3500-3750miles between oil changes depending where you live and how you drive. Found that out today, definitely not spending $70 on an oil change.
3656 2018-02-05 16:04:11 Also when those countries find a a way to profit, like I think Norway found oil of the coast, it actually goes to helping the people and raising their standard of living. Here it seems like profits from our natural resources just go to offshore accounts.
3657 2018-02-05 16:03:48 If it takes 11 MJ to boil a gallon of water, it takes about 0.05 barrel-of-oil-equivalents to produce 1 gallon of maple syrup. There's about the same amount of energy in 38 pounds of dry firewood. pretty interesting. (back of the envelope, take with a grain of salt)
3658 2018-02-05 16:03:26 If Berwick rejoins Scotland that could be interesting for division of oil fields. Wasn't there a Blair fudge as well - in England's favour.

3667 2018-02-05 16:01:58 How so? Switch to us currency. $3.50 per gal for gas. Each state or territory is independent over the federal govt. Lower taxes, full price for our oil, no more pipeline problems & better emergency services. There are a lot in the win column.

3695 2018-02-05 15:57:19 So I'm getting my oil changed and it's going to be an hour and half wait   my phone is dying at an alarming rate
3696 2018-02-05 15:57:12 The day there’s that much traffic on center street like in that commercial is the day the price of a barrel of oil goes back up

3698 2018-02-05 15:57:01 Engine turned over and over, a little slow but no ignition. It sounded a little sluggish like the battery wasn't fully charged. Eventually after a lot of cranking both cars started up fine.  I guess it could have been oil sitting there for 7 weeks turning to gel.
3699 2018-02-05 15:57:01 I have eaten many a MCD's french fry and I am very much still bald.  Do I have to drink the oil?

3713 2018-02-05 15:54:41 I second tea tree oil! It's kind of amazing and even makes weird cystic acne a lot less severe. 

Mizon black snail cream has been great for winter moisturizing & doesn't make me break out like most things do, plus it's really cheap.
3714 2018-02-05 15:54:29 Fuck! I guess I must ask, can you pass Leather Daddy DaNoose some baby oil for.... umm nevermind the reason
3715 2018-02-05 15:54:22 Ahh! Wish I had a grandma like that. Mine hid oil olive from me (I wanted it drizzled on everything and preferred dip for bread). Also she distrusted anyone even slightly fat (if woman: a thief, if man: a merchant).

3723 2018-02-05 15:53:53 James. In my opinion The EU was hampering Russia's access to Mediterranean ports and oil pipelines in ME. Gadaffi and Saddam were going to switch from petro$ to € for their oil and that didn't suit USA. Hence this unholy alliance. Stable EU a threat to £+$ so? Destabilise EU!

3730 2018-02-05 15:53:01 Along with the U.S. State Department nominating me as a top five finalist to represent the United States at the 2011 emerging leaders UNESCO forum in Paris ... I have been invited to participate in business, policy and oil and gas conferences in the U.S., Europe and Middle East.
3731 2018-02-05 15:52:36 How about one million Iraq's dead, four million homeless, water and electric in short supply, because George Bush, wanted the oil. Iraq I was there. all based on a lie war is a racket! And the CIA armed and put Saddam Hussein into power, in the first place.
3732 2018-02-05 15:52:31 GEJ was more careful. He knew that place was insecure so he pulled out workers unlike the President who sent in NNPC staff to look for oil in that region. Have they been rescued from Boko Haram that has been completely defeated.  GEJ values life.

3736 2018-02-05 15:52:10 Do you spray your hair with liquid before using your hair food? It needs to be damp to be able to absorb iproduct kahle. I spray my hair everyday, use some Caivil Fusion oil and then seal with shea butter.

3741 2018-02-05 15:51:24 I dont agree. We would be a powerhouse with our Oil, Gas, farming and water.  Lots to contribute to their greatness.  Canada is not interested.

3746 2018-02-05 15:50:44 I am going to venture out today.  I haven't felt like leaving the house.  I need to get oil changed in truck, go to bank.
3747 2018-02-05 15:50:43 You love oil & hate many animals. I don't know how you feel about fish,birds,marine mammals.
3748 2018-02-05 15:50:22 does the 40p cake mix work out cheaper than buying the equivalent of flour and sugar and oil, though?

3752 2018-02-05 15:50:07 Putin desperately wants a war in the Middle East. The goal is to drive up oil prices, create a shortage as a cover for Donnie to lift the sanctions
3753 2018-02-05 15:50:06 Additionally hydrogen is bs. It is the fossil fuel answer to the end of oil. The physics and chemistry guarantees it will always cost much more than EVs. It is used as a poison pill to delay better projects
3754 2018-02-05 15:50:04 We have reached out to you and are looking forward to assisting you regarding you recent oil change service. Thank you for providing us your feedback!

It takes two to make peace and Israeli governments felt they couldn't trust the Palestinian leadership.
They have much more to lose (and a history to prove it).
I feel that the US has been happy to leave Israel isolated and dependent. OIL & control

3774 2018-02-05 15:46:35 I don’t doubt people were impacted by disruptions. But we were facing economic difficulty with North Sea oil & Labour were drowned out by the Tory campaign that promised to sort out those pesky protestors & getting the bins taken away. Didnt solve the problem though, just sold it

3790 2018-02-05 15:44:50 Currently a battle in play between E&P's and OSC's.  E&P's want to hold day rates steady, but increase capacity.  OSC's want to raise day rates, in order to increase capacity.  Just like oil has a true cost, so do OSC's, especially if you attempt to add capacity.
3791 2018-02-05 15:44:49 So turns out. Janitorial floor wax contains fish oil.
3792 2018-02-05 15:44:45 The crushing of the olive is necessary at this point in your life. It will produce an overflow of oil. Persevere!
3793 2018-02-05 15:44:32 #oil just put in a double bottom on 1hr chart. 64.53 is bottom, bullish signal, and is confirming higher this moment. I look for "whales" to push this higher today and then lower overnight after market close.
3794 2018-02-05 15:44:30 Love oil,Marge? Figures. You probably laughed at all the waterfowl covered in it after the BP oil spill. Your  hero hates nature & wilflife;why shouldn't you?

3823 2018-02-05 15:41:54 I hate oil,too. HATE IT. Hint: Other countries are not just "taking away oil & cars". They are transitioning away from it by going green. Right now,the U.S is the most backward 1st World country in the world.

3858 2018-02-05 15:37:10 With one massive land coverage benefit and other income sourcing! Where they gain on a manufacturing level we make up with on farming and ranching commodities earnings. Granted though their oil was never discounted to one country of sale, and was sold at the Brent price.

3923 2018-02-05 15:28:24 Buhari did not get us out of any recession, we got out because oil prices improved. Q3 2017 non oil sector still fell and we only had 0.7% growth bcos oil sector grew 25% on the back of higher crude. Let's stop joking. This president is incompetent and needs to go.

3942 2018-02-05 15:26:08 You are absolutely right.  He is a major liar and he has attempted to destroy our democracy.  He is destroying our planet by giving away our national parks to big oil and gas.  This man does not belong in the white house.  He has taken us into the dark ages.

3968 2018-02-05 15:21:40 True, although not really an "even" for Exxon. In the carbon budget for a 2C world, Exxon needs a steep fall in coal, to allow room for oil and gas. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong, of course
3969 2018-02-05 15:21:36 Guess i finally get my oil changed 
3970 2018-02-05 15:21:33 And yet you are so blind to the realities that you won't even read when the SNP-led Sc Gov show you data (as I sent you) showing that geographical allocation of oil revenues is already there! Until you face the realities you can't build a cogent, honest case.
3971 2018-02-05 15:21:26 Black people are too forgiving. That's why it seems like they will never learn that water and oil will never mix. Why are you following DA with its agendas to undermine your black excellence. If you were intelligent, you should have had another strong party rep'n you

4029 2018-02-05 15:14:37 And it was because UK and US companies wanted Iranian oil, while the democratically elected president of Iran was acting to nationalize their oil reserves. He thought the oil belonged to the people of Iran. British Petroleum disagreed.

4064 2018-02-05 15:10:41 A guest came up to me today at work.

'I had someone leave me a bag of oil here at the front desk'

....

What?
4065 2018-02-05 15:10:37 That's all true. And I'm not advocating for fossil fuels. But as a commodity gets more scarce, the price goes up. We will need crude oil for many things in the centuries to come. Just not all for energy or fuel. It would be silly to be dependent on hostile governments for it.

4069 2018-02-05 15:10:10 So is your position that the Scottish Government are lying to us? Because the oil allocation is clearly noted in what I sent you. And I've proved your "we only get 8% of oil revenue" is complete fabrication.

You are therefore demonstrably a liar.

4096 2018-02-05 15:06:39 The self-appointed 'natural governing party of Canada' needed a blank slate, supposedly attractive looking frontman they could manipulate.  Couldn't care less about ethics or the good of Canada.  Wonder who's REALLY runing the show?  All that oil money from middle east perhaps???

4123 2018-02-05 15:03:28 engine oil doesn't get consumed/burnt like Gas, Spirit or Kerosine. It just lubricates and remains there; no energy produced, not energy expended. That's what I think

4139 2018-02-05 15:01:26 Oil and gas production companies need to control and reduce costs to maintain cash flow and profits. To accomplish this, companies are transitioning to LED industrial lighting fixtures to reduce utility and maintenance costs.
4140 2018-02-05 15:01:14 Now multiply Norway's exports to the level of the UK, and you have a big problem. They don't export that much, besides oil...

4169 2018-02-05 14:59:05 I forgot the rules about medical pot over there
However, a high CBD with low THC won’t get you stoned, look into it.
Use a tincture or oil, smoking is bad.
4170 2018-02-05 14:59:02 It's a good brand. The 2 in 1 actually rated higher than all brands in Consumer Reports. Got oil out of my t-shirt. I swear by it. Makes tide look like a store brand
4171 2018-02-05 14:58:53 Is your position so weak that hearing a point of view different from the oil industry position presented so dangerous????
4172 2018-02-05 14:58:50 I wish I was cool with my neighbors so I could ask them for some olive oil, instead of going to the store right now 
4173 2018-02-05 14:58:46 I concur. This is not a good way to recreate the surprise of the original. Wherein the monster was a deep sea monster infant woken by an oil company, if you recall.

How about TAX plan that helps rich alot more average people

4219 2018-02-05 14:52:23 And why should these special interest oil groups be the ONLY voices heard???
Why shouldn’t ordinary citizens have a voice in our govt, too?
Govt should be for the citizens it governs. Not just to further enrich oil companies.

4227 2018-02-05 14:50:11 I think the large quantity of oil is what 'saves' Norway's EEA, but non-democratic place in the single market and its satellite system. Not really to do with EFTA alone. Norway is also only partially in the single market system. Its confusing but sadly it matters!
4228 2018-02-05 14:50:10 That makes the two of us Karabo, me and sea food ngamanzi ne oil.
4229 2018-02-05 14:50:09 Good question. Increased crush normally would mean increased oil stocks. But if oil yield continues to fall below prior years it the impact may be muted.

Interest rates are heading up & are probably causing most of the short term scare in the markets.  35° here.
4233 2018-02-05 14:49:32 What about focusing on the damage you are doing through the destruction of fragile eco systems to produce Palm Oil?
4234 2018-02-05 14:49:30 Well Carol, even Trump (a rather accomplished snake oil salesman) can’t seem to sell people on the tax bill. Thankfully, a hefty majority of us don’t buy the b.s. With it’s abysmal approval ratings, people will be headed to the polls later this year. See you there! #bluewave

4238 2018-02-05 14:48:23 Why is Trump repealing regulations that protect our environment?  To satisfy corporate greed, because that is who his base is.  Believe me, oil and gas executives don’t care if they rape our country and coastlines, as long as it helps their bottom line.

4246 2018-02-05 14:46:19 You know what goes good with kale? Coconut oil. It slides right from the pan into the trash can.  :-)
4247 2018-02-05 14:46:16 Yea it’s essentially like an oil pull, and if you mix the oil into another you can use it for oil pulling and it is far more effective

4250 2018-02-05 14:46:09 The other photo are the ones I use with vehicular oils. The almond one goes three or four drops in the conditioner, but for a whole bottle. The spray I made I used vehicular oil plus some of almond oils, and tea tree oil from my mothers.
4251 2018-02-05 14:46:04 BP apologized for their oil spill. Does that mean they planned it? There are individuals, companies, and governments making mistakes that actually effect people’s lives, and when they apologize for it we don’t suddenly pretend it means it was a ploy. That’s your problem.

4257 2018-02-05 14:45:28 It's interesting how mining always gets hit the most. Oil never gets hit as bad as mining even though its way more profitable.

4282 2018-02-05 14:41:47 for super dry skin i swear by coconut oil. it also does a wonderful job at removing makeup. it's so gentle and easy to find. i recommend cleansing after if you have clogged skin bc it can add to that
4283 2018-02-05 14:41:43 I know this aul fella and no matter what way the conversation is going he'll always find a way to mention that palm oil is destroying the ecosystem and guess what is full of palm oil? Nutella

4317 2018-02-05 14:36:56 Also strikes are usually targeted against the terrorists spots on the border and not on the country's military (kinda the same for Pak actually :p) . So it'll just be putting oil in fire. It won't actually hurt the Pak forces.

4319 2018-02-05 14:36:43 But turning over food-producing land to ethanol production, and virgin rainforest in Indonesia/Malaysia and now Central Africa and South America, for palm oil, which vastly slashes and burns the world’s lungs and exacerbates global warming, is no answer either.

4334 2018-02-05 14:35:05 I fundamentally disagree with Mike Hawes. Diesel isn't the answer - it's the problem.

4342 2018-02-05 14:34:12 I would stop export of USA gasoline components and crude oil to Venezuela. Maduro will have a hard time explaining on TV why he imports them. These measures have to be supplemented by organization of a 20 thousand strong Liberation Army which will take down the dictatorship.
4343 2018-02-05 14:34:07 Also, even though they are a bit expensive, you can use them for a lot of things (I use it for a hair spray, I put almond oil in my conditioner, and for my legs) and you don't actually need much, so it last long! 

Well, it's an advise. I hope it helps!

4358 2018-02-05 14:32:53 Of course it would! The reason they put palm oil in Nutella and peanut butter is because it stops it separating so that lazy people who can’t be bothered to stir it, don’t have to. So orangs are losing their homes for this? Unfuckingbelievable! #palmoilkills

4513 2018-02-05 14:13:11 I have never been huge into the hippie dippie oil fads. But i have severe sinus issues today and coworker gave me oil of oregano to put on my tongue. I CAN SMELL EVERYTHING now. Holy crap that stuff is ridiculous. (also it tastes like liquid pepper on your tongue/death)

4515 2018-02-05 14:12:52 I made fresh batch of my essential oils mixture as I've done countless times. I added Peppermint oil (instead of my usual Tea Tree oil), but I obviously put too much. Oi! My face woke right up!

4525 2018-02-05 14:11:57 Having shitloads of oil for a country of 5 million people hasn't exactly harmed it either...
4526 2018-02-05 14:11:51 Norway's more prudent management of oil revenues and use of a sovereign wealth fund may also be a factor mind you.

4528 2018-02-05 14:11:38 No. They’ll soon be promoting some fake chemical shitstorm slime hydrogenated paste in a tub. Something that will kill you quicker than you can say ‘boo’.

4589 2018-02-05 14:05:34 Probably (and hopefully not) use the windfall from higher oil prices to subsidise the price to save face. IF (and a very big if) they lose, they leave a ton of problem for the next administration to deal. And it goes on and on...

4647 2018-02-05 13:59:40 I normally agree with you, but I think Norway's economy is saved by their oil and sound government policies; their sovereign fund is worth over $1 trillion! At the same time most of their politicians say that being in the EFTA is worse than being in the EU, as you're a rule taker

4655 2018-02-05 13:59:03 Last time I got an oil change I was asked if I wanted my tires rotated, new windshield wipers, was told I needed a new filter and they tried giving me the most expensive oil. Like do u think this is my first oil change ever?? I’ve been through this and NO.

4687 2018-02-05 13:55:24 The cost of aluminum is directly connected to the price of oil. Over 50% of Chinese smelters operated at a loss in 2016.  The US smelters don't have that luxury because our government isn't in the business of subsidizing unprofitable industries.

4689 2018-02-05 13:55:18 Considering that State went rogue against the orders of FDR and cut off  oil sales to Japan, basically inviting Japan to attack us at Pearl Harbor and force us into the war - they've been corrupt  almost since the department's inception.

4746 2018-02-05 13:45:04 Oiling the sealing ring keeps it healthy as over a prolonged period of use under pressure it can start to harden, the oil prevents this. On first use you only need to use water with either diluted vinegar/lemon and this will clear residue from manufacturing :)

4754 2018-02-05 13:43:55 Then we don't have to buy Middle East oil & then go to war to maintain those supplies, simples really. If we don't want fracking, wars in the ME then I suggest all of Britain, walk, don't take foreign holidays (using jet fuel and lots of it), don't buy goods & services etc. etc.
4755 2018-02-05 13:43:24 Yet if black folks want 2 peacefully protest killings of unarmed people, or Native Americans want to peacefully protest against using THEIR tribal lands for oil drilling...police bring out the tear gas & riot gear with a quickness

4919 2018-02-05 13:19:46 Out of oil for heat, no one apparently has the money to pay it so we are freezing and I refuse to get sick. This sucks...

4926 2018-02-05 13:18:26 Thank you, I’m feeling slightly better this morning but I barely slept at all. It doesn’t help that I burned my face with essential oil again too lol

4928 2018-02-05 13:17:53 WHO IS THE HOT READ HEAD WORKING AT THE NORTHWEST OIL ON GARFIELD
4929 2018-02-05 13:17:47 Just eat it, because otherwise the tree that was used to make the oil and the plants that were cut down to make the sugar were destroyed for no purpose.
4930 2018-02-05 13:17:46 ’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells...
4931 2018-02-05 13:17:33 So this is why the mega rich are dumping oil & gas stocks like a hot potato. Wow!
4932 2018-02-05 13:17:13 Nothing new remember when president Cheney considered adding Venezuela (a country that's never been a threat to anyone) to  the "axis of evil" list- the "evil" there to the GOP is the massive quantity of oil- just like Iraq and Iran
4933 2018-02-05 13:17:12 LifeStyle: Flaxseed oil can treat brittle hair and nails and prevent them from splitting. It is also effective against irritating scalp conditions caused by eczema.
4934 2018-02-05 13:17:05 Hahaa... ini jelas ngarang ? Dlm debat capres, Jkw sdh jelas tegaskan bahwa dia akan bubarkan praktek monopoli oil trading, yg disinyaler petral ada diblkng praktek ini, pd saat itu SS durung dadi wong dul..

4936 2018-02-05 13:17:03 If you cook it in olive oil, it slides out of the pan and into the trash a lot easier.
4937 2018-02-05 13:16:50 Here is a scenario: 
Shale adds 1 mb/d while Libya and Nigeria add 400kb/d, at a time when we lose Venezuelan oil and part of Canadian crude!  Imagin, not the price, imagin the differentials!

4941 2018-02-05 13:16:22 A mechanic rebuilds your car engine. He uses the manuals, services your car & gives U the car back saying it’s fixed. U drive home only 2 have the engine seize. A $1.50 oil plug wasn’t installed. Same 4 the FISA warrant. Dossier May have been small part but it seized the engine.
4942 2018-02-05 13:16:17 LifeStyle: Flaxseed oil can heal inflamed skin areas in cases of acne, rosacea, and eczema. The topical application of this oil heals sunburns effectively.
4943 2018-02-05 13:16:15 WHY does @FT say issue of who owns Scottish waters OIL/GAS will be biggest issue post-indy? Scotland is RICH, England is NOT.

4966 2018-02-05 13:11:48 Once cut loose this process. It can't recoup again. Raised commodity values would not reduce when the oil prices are down. Hope so
4967 2018-02-05 13:11:47 Making fun of a man who has continually lied and sold snake oil to fund his lavish lifestyle and now falls victim to a cerebral incident without any intervention from the God he claims to represent?

Well of course
4968 2018-02-05 13:11:43 No wonder it never seems to go off! We had a jar in the cupboard for years. Wouldn't touch the stuff personally and the fact that it contains palm oil makes it a very big no no.

4970 2018-02-05 13:11:27 Yes, I believe Tillerson was brought in to help end sanctions so Exxon could begin drilling for oil in Russia.

5021 2018-02-05 13:03:25 It's insincere. Taking away all onshore oil from the states is not, for starters. Let the states own all the oil within their territories, on or off shore!
5022 2018-02-05 13:03:24 @allstarcharts I also see that Canada & Australia are breaking out and that oil has rallied.  EMs have lead since 2016.  I recall one of your earliest podcast guests pointed out that it has been EM tech that has lead.  South Korea, India, etc.

5027 2018-02-05 13:02:16 So far my family has avoided it by the grace of God. I HIGHLY recommend coconut oil. It’s literally miracle stuff! It’s an antibiotic, moisturizer, immunity builder, and it keeps stomach bugs at bay.
5028 2018-02-05 13:01:43 Deep conditioners, protein treatments, spritzing with water and then putting oil on it. Spritzing with water and then sleeping in a plastic cap with slightly damp hair. Biotin pills, scalp massages w peppermint/castor oil.

5054 2018-02-05 12:58:50 They may want to review the part where all on-shore oil is taken from the owners. That's the con right there and that's the reason they gave in to restructuring. That's like eating your cake and having more of it back!

5073 2018-02-05 12:57:16 The best way to make them crispy every time is fry! Just rinse & dry the wings, then into peanut oil. I love spicy teriyaki wings - Franks mixed into a good store bought sauce.  In Texas, we usually have ranch on the side. PS It’s treason for us to cheer on anyone but the Boys.
5074 2018-02-05 12:57:08 Under 15% from my understanding. Many of the people from the island I’ve talked to tell me PR had one of the worst electrical grids, prior to getting hit by the storm. Electrical plants are old and outdated (using fuel oil rather than coal or newer). Not sure what people expect.

5090 2018-02-05 12:53:37 Hasn't Rio done equally well or better, so isn't the share price up due to increased commodity prices - especially Iron Ore and Oil?
Agree Elliot has however pushed for selling off shale oil - thankfully prices on the up.
5091 2018-02-05 12:53:20 I didn't know there was a two hour delay so I look like death warmed over but on the plus side I have 2 hours to get my oil changed and plan my week so it honestly worked out perfectly

His bubbly ass was rubbing slowly against the wrestler's large bulge while both his and Bathym's hands were squeezing and groping wherever they pleased. The oil also provided a lot of squelching noises whenever they touched and smacked each -

5111 2018-02-05 12:49:34 I'm not against having Youths rule this country, but it'll also excite you to know that in their 30s OBJ, IBB ruled as a full time dictator without any National Assembly. They messed up the country, one stole a national Farm, another stole our Gulf oil money!

5215 2018-02-05 12:29:41 Castor oil is really beneficent. I’ve got 4C hair and because castor oil is thick, it doesn’t dry out my hair, unlike coconut oil that just makes my hair very brittle. Also invest in good leave in conditioners like Cantu or African Pride.
5216 2018-02-05 12:29:34 @AmysBakingCo I'm happy this place got shut down. Botj of you are donkey gay shits. Your food is frozen and taste like a burnt engine oil. I don't give a fuck if Samy(Shitmy) or Amy(Amshit) roast me. Place is down so you can only shit in my face faggots.

I shouldn't need to explain the economic significance of that, regardless of ScotGov. revenues from Oil!

5353 2018-02-05 12:02:30 All these "beauty" products makes me curious. Do they actually work and what did they put in the bloody product? Almost every product is the same, just different marketing.

In the end, virgin coconut oil >>>>
5354 2018-02-05 12:01:37 The answer is always baby oil.

5366 2018-02-05 12:00:00 The statement also completely neglects the fact that many, many of today's producing oilfields are revisited 'duster' fields from years gone by. Also dismisses technology having moved on in 60 years, and that a major would have the same production strategy as an oil minnow #UKOG

5369 2018-02-05 11:59:36 @thismorning shouldn’t the UK make legal Cannabis oil to help with chronic pain. It’s seems it’s illegal and they push harder drugs on people to help with pain that are not working and messing up there insides. It’s legal in USA and has been helping all sorts of illnesses 
5370 2018-02-05 11:59:31 Modi’s four years - a culinary guide: 2014 was the year of the dhokla - soft and white, promising good health - but there was oil poured on it and black pepper seeds to remind you that things could get hard and hot. 1/5

5373 2018-02-05 11:59:12 You mean when the oil companies call you go con American children into dying for their profits, right?
5374 2018-02-05 11:59:00 Angola is the largest African crude oil supplier to USA.
5375 2018-02-05 11:58:58 Doesn't quite sound like also murdering million iraqis just for oil...
5376 2018-02-05 11:58:50 Could you apply oil to all the other car parks for plausible deniability?
5377 2018-02-05 11:58:48 Rich people kau peh BN because of the 6%. KNS nia...pay high income tax already some more kena pay GST. But the funny part is poor people will continue to support UMNO & BN because they can get BR1M, a bag of rice, a kg of sugar & a bottle of cooking oil. They forgot about GST.

5379 2018-02-05 11:58:45 I guess it has something to do with your screen's sensitivity. A combination of air and dust can simulate a light touch, and yung oil sa fingertips mo.. Y'know.. Simple ghost touch sa screen.

5382 2018-02-05 11:58:13 Seriously? Secretary of State Tillerson is considering restrictions on Venezuela oil until they have "free, fair, and verifiable elections". Between voter suppression, #Gerrymandering , uncounted ballots and possible rigged voting machines, Republicans have no room to talk.
5383 2018-02-05 11:58:11 @thismorning I have had fibromyalgia for 17 years, I have found NO pain medication actually works completely. I tried Medicinal Cannabis Oil, taken as 1 rice grain size drop twice a day it gave more relief than anything else I have tried and gave me NO side effects at all.
5384 2018-02-05 11:58:10 Feeling the palm oil guilt now! #elevenseshour
5385 2018-02-05 11:57:57 good point maybe its cos the prior do not keep the arabic oil lords happy

5387 2018-02-05 11:57:18 Guy.... You head get oil
5388 2018-02-05 11:57:18 The more I think about it... CF1 and CF2 are connected because of the Japanese oil rig company. And Japan fought in WW2 where CF4 is going to be in. So maybe they'll explain the origins of the Japanese company. Just a thought.

5401 2018-02-05 11:55:05 Sure! I follow ANP rounds for new oil fields because I work with it. If you want me to share some reports just let me know! :)
5402 2018-02-05 11:54:59 Oil is currently a drain on the exchequer. Tax is very low (at Swinney’s request), and the industry’s costs are high. Therefore there is virtually no tax revenue from oil while exchequer refunds tax already paid.
5403 2018-02-05 11:54:40 The capitalists deceive us into believing that they have rights to land, oil and other concessions.
5404 2018-02-05 11:54:33 It’s the crushing of the grapes that produce the “Wine.” It’s the crushing of the olive that produces the "Oil" Do not resist the "Crushings Of The Lord" it will transform us.

5406 2018-02-05 11:54:10 In the 80's when people had sense, tree planting campaigns were carried out to combat the desertification of the North. Then they discovered oil and abandoned it.

5409 2018-02-05 11:53:42 Not a left , right issue. Wall Street loved Hitler. He was a union breaker. Standard oil kept the German planes in tha air, IBM helped keep the trains running, US auto plants in Germany cranked out material for the Nazi’s. Operation Paperclip, we got Nazi all over us.

5416 2018-02-05 11:51:57 Money is everything. Gasprom has had a hand in the violence under the protection of Putin. It is, and until we are free of oil's curse, always will be about oil.

5419 2018-02-05 11:51:05 I did read that! See, I couldn't find really any similarities between CF1 and CF2 other than John Goodman's character having work with Slusho or that oil rig. There's the obvious tie between CF1 and CF3 but I'm wondering how Overlord will add to this franchise.
5420 2018-02-05 11:50:37 Ah I know the one. Oil should do the trick!
5421 2018-02-05 11:50:31 #ThisMorning Alternative ways to get some actual pain relief that normal medication wont give you, take some CBD Oil. Try from @cbdbrothers or try a @MediPen

5424 2018-02-05 11:50:02 Haven't been in cash like this for almost 2 years. Nothing to buy right now. Be careful out there, don't buy into downtrends or try to pick bottoms. Very risky. I made that mistake a couple years ago with oil as a rookie and it killed me.

5432 2018-02-05 11:48:51 @Botanygeek Hi James, what’s the situation with palm oil? Is ‘sustainable’ palm oil actually any better for the environment? Health wise is it any better/worse than other oils?
5433 2018-02-05 11:48:45 So long as you don't give a damn about he environment and destruction of huge areas of rainforest and Forrests given over to the production of palm oil (which doesn't even have to be used in making Nutella but is a cheap easy way of doing so). Trees are the lungs of the world!

5482 2018-02-05 11:37:20 Why is Industrial #Agriculture so unsustainable? 
Increased use of fossil fuels means increase of GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions
Use of fossil fuels means the price of food depends & fluctuates according to the price of oil

5578 2018-02-05 11:16:37 I don't think you grasp how irresponsible this is.

5612 2018-02-05 11:09:58 As has been established in the oil and gas industry, multinationals can and do indeed hold nations to ransom. The PIB comes to mind. But the challenge is whether our governance process is able to articulate these issues when some investor is being promoted as an FDI source.
5613 2018-02-05 11:09:57 @Gus_ODonnell Not one forecast made by the treasury or the Bank of England has been close to the reality. That means you are either politically biased or economically incompetent. We are accused of selling snake oil and adopting the same tactics as the Nazies in the 1930's
5614 2018-02-05 11:09:49 FT is wrong. There are NO problems deciding who gets what from oil. Scotland gets every drop within its recognised International Sea Area. This matter was all sorted out and debated during last IndyRef.

5629 2018-02-05 11:06:38 Ah yes but there's a new tone today. Suddenly they're showing signs of panic. They know they need a free trade deal just as much as we do. We need it to oil the wheels of import/export. They need it for the money.
5630 2018-02-05 11:05:55 5000MW is about the size of ONE coal fired power plant. Global coal is~4000GW but there is oil and gas too. Even windpower is only~500GW.

5649 2018-02-05 11:02:23 I will stop saying: “Please don’t use the phrase DATA IS THE NEW OIL - oil is disgusting, data not.”

It turns out that the power consumption of handling BIG DATA can have a similar devastating impact to our #environment.

5700 2018-02-05 10:48:39 Definitely doable! Those I made weren't yeasted and still ok I think — good charring on the grill is key, plus maybe salt and a slick of oil when warm
5701 2018-02-05 10:48:19 Salmon is really a necessity, MrPatchyCat, as its oil keeps your skin and coat soft and shiny...as least that's what we tell mum!
5702 2018-02-05 10:48:18 Juicy kebabs... turn them into oil free rolls or wraps or just munch into them...
5703 2018-02-05 10:48:03 Does all of the oil & gas extracted in Scottish waters ends up on Scottish shores (e.g the Forties pipeline)? Surely the only problem would be if it's piped from Scottish platforms to a pipeline in England?
5704 2018-02-05 10:47:50 A service plus oil leak, well that will be the bill when the part comes off back order!, need to add another £400 to that in a months time when it have to buy some front tyres

5710 2018-02-05 10:44:57 Absolutely. While the work can be complex, Prof Alex Kemp has been doing it for decades. There would be debate over the 6,000 sq. miles that Blair nicked from Scottish waters, but there's no doubt over 88% of the Scottish oil fields.
5711 2018-02-05 10:43:55 I hope the anti-pipeline people walked to the meeting. just to support their cause. If they keep it up there will be no gas or oil in BC.

5718 2018-02-05 10:41:55 Medium-large Hydel plants take 5-10 years for completion but provide cheap, clean electricity while coal, LNG, furnace oil, gas, etc. are quicker to complete but negatively impact environment and health besides providing expensive electricity. That's why KP didn't go for these.

5722 2018-02-05 10:40:57 For PH I'd suggest the poor addressing of a majority of residences is a potential deal breaker esp when it comes to deliveries. Another one is that quite a lot of the oil workers who have d disposable income hv their families living in Lagos so orders arer placed in/from Lagos.

5766 2018-02-05 10:30:51 Excuse me for appearing thick but if they "know exactly how to achieve .. Full regulatory alignment" why wouldn't they explain that to us now so that May could consign Mogg and his ERG chums back to their snake oil selling?

5768 2018-02-05 10:30:12 That's oil been sprayed on the dust blinding before application of asphalt, if I ain't mistaken... The oil is black in colour and the blinding is brown, so the resulting colour looks like asphalt, but it IS NOT asphalt.

5771 2018-02-05 10:29:17 Market Factors Feb 5: Oil prices on Monday extended declines from the end of last week amid a wider market sell off and a stronger dollar, with Brent crude falling to its lowest in nearly a month.
5772 2018-02-05 10:28:43 Wait, how much unhealthy stuff is even in pancakes? Because it seems to me it's just whatever oil you use plus whatever toppings you choose. The essential pancakedness is pretty healthy.
5773 2018-02-05 10:28:41 I'm oily/combi too! I cleanse with oil (if I've been wearing make-up) and black soap/ Dove shea (doesn't dry me out). I do this with a face sponge. Then I tone with a witch hazel based toner and apply a thin layer of coconut oil on my face. I finish with a Vitamin E eye cream.
5774 2018-02-05 10:28:30 It is going to help us a bit seriously. When Zuma goes out of office, the price of oil will drove as well.

I was happy to learn they could swim though because some we saw may have had to swim to the other side of the river because I was told palm oil companies were moving in near them. Adjacent to Tanjung Putin NP.
6051 2018-02-05 09:25:14 Seriously? We are your biggest trade country. You also have a trade surplus not a trade deficit as you may have been led to believe. We are the largest supplier of oil, nature gas, electricity ect.. to the US.

6087 2018-02-05 09:20:32 Cool story. Except that's not how it happened at all. The National oil policy was a protectionist measure to curb American investment in Alberta oil. The industry was already quite well developed by that time with an extensive infrastructure.

Put it in a sealed container and into the refrigerator...

Reuse it until before it starts to develop foul odor, taste, and smell...
And then discard it...

6203 2018-02-05 08:58:30 Devaluation was caused by very low oil prices, which was at around $30 at the time. For some time the prices have been hovering around $70, meanwhile the state budget are still based on oil price of $45. Manat has only strengthened against USD. I don't see any signs.

6219 2018-02-05 08:55:41 It's important to maintain the oil/water balance in the skin to keep it healthy.
3. Protect. Use sun protection during the day, include antioxidants rich products in your routine to give the skin a fighting chance.
6220 2018-02-05 08:55:20 At the core of every skincare routine is 3 basics:
1. Cleanse properly. Twice a day, AM and PM, with a gentle yet thorough cleanser.
2. Moisturize. Whether it's with a serum, lotion, cream or oil, we all need to moisturize.

6347 2018-02-05 08:23:48 The stir, the oil slicked skin, heat beginning to seep through, a finger dips, a little more wine, just before the simmer, that taste, faint trace of the familiar, almost there, but not quite, best put in the bin, it’ll make the dog sick, takeaway just fine as always...  #MuseMon

6353 2018-02-05 08:22:29 The truth is these big oil tycoons and natural gas companies are trying to make as much money as they can before their investments go belly up. Renewables will put them out of business. Thus a 30% tariff put on solar panels which is meant to hurt these stocks.

6357 2018-02-05 08:21:36 Taking the Brent Crude Oil price into consideration from 1 Jan 2018, we can take a low of $66 and a high of $71. Increase of 7.57% - plays a role in the 30c reduction per liter for petrol.

6493 2018-02-05 07:56:01 Why do people still use oil burners?
6494 2018-02-05 07:55:56 The manga shows there are many Clovies in the sea and alludes to an occult that worships them and other spirits (see: Overlord). What woke that Clovis was Tagruato’s oil drilling. I think Cloverfield Paradox shifted all timelines which is why

6498 2018-02-05 07:55:12 It's somewhat rich of Lord O'Donnell to accuse people of "selling snake oil" for daring to point out that Whitehall economic forecasts are almost always wrong.
6499 2018-02-05 07:54:52 my issue is resolved but I do feel cheated as I had to pay ₹565 for my product under warranty and false accusations were made by your engineers stating use of 1st steel plate and then Oil in oven.. i will re think 100 times before going for IFB in future. thanks.

6596 2018-02-05 07:27:33 Well, first off, the main form of fiscal payback is the royalties. We own the oil. The labour costs of extraction are costs TO us.
6597 2018-02-05 07:27:33 Single biggest suck on economic fortunes in 2018 is rent. Single biggest driver of oil consumption & pollution is people driving long distances to work.

6794 2018-02-05 06:36:55 Yes. I wonder what role it is specifically playing now. It appears US oil companies & Russian companies might have similar goals--to keep prices high, open up North Pole--but also there will be conflicts over that area as well.

6801 2018-02-05 06:34:33 I liked it, though I found the premise that Earth ran out of energy a little hard to accept. Sure, oil is scarce, but what about solar? Wind? Hydro? People on bikes? Overall, it was pretty good though

6843 2018-02-05 06:24:08 I wish someone would write an article on the oil angle for Trump-Russia. Oil is key to Russia's economic future. What is the role of US oil companies, etc. in this whole weird thing. The Secretary of State was an oil exec. Article with facts, not innuendo.

6917 2018-02-05 06:09:11 They aren't Canadian tankers. They are just tankers from wherever, Iran, Liberia, Korea, etc. Canada doesn't have any big tankers.  Once the oil is on board, the Canadian industry is done. They may escort to the mouth of the strait but they don't take responsibility.

6940 2018-02-05 06:03:55 I think key members of Trump's campaign (and rich investors) were in it for deals, Exxon/Russia oil deal, Nuclear power plants, Trump's brand, money laundering, tax breaks. Trump's corrupt but he's not a mastermind. He's a willing partner in a scam. Scared. He's got $$$ secrets.

AND please run for office. We #TheResistance are stand behind you.
6945 2018-02-05 06:03:06 and d) It’s especially obnoxious when settlers assert this towards Indigenous peoples, given that it’s the settler’s imposed systems that are forcing oil use, and the oil itself is stolen resources from stolen land, causing pollution harming that stolen land.

6950 2018-02-05 06:01:32 Coal disrupted organic growth of cities with industrial revolution. Oil in deserts took this to its extreme.

6952 2018-02-05 06:01:27 i use castor & tea tree oil faithfully  those my go to’s when it come to skin care
6953 2018-02-05 06:01:26 USD drowning, oil prices rising and market is tanking....the blood is just getting started who will you blame
6954 2018-02-05 06:01:13 I'm telling you every poisonous emission from oil is killing the planet and us with it. Taxing us out of oil dependence is good by me no matter what they call the tax. Carbon tax is for carbon monoxide too.
6955 2018-02-05 06:01:05 c) They ignore the existence of a deliberately built system that require the use of oil, which is imposed on the majority of the population (forcing you to drive, etc). It’s structural, not individual. Lots of examples elsewhere in the world show other lower energy ways of living

6962 2018-02-05 05:59:48 Give me oil in my lamp keep me burning.
6963 2018-02-05 05:59:35 Usually the oil they’re fried in is not, most restaurants use an oil that contains gluten
6964 2018-02-05 05:59:28 my eyelashes are coated in coconut oil and I can barely see anything
6965 2018-02-05 05:59:25 Their burgers are fine but the exact wrong way to make fries is to dump a bunch of raw potatoes into hot oil and cook until done.
6966 2018-02-05 05:59:14 We are all doing something, every day, but in your case, on palm oil, is it adequate or  fast enough?  Not to me, according to your own report.
6967 2018-02-05 05:59:10 Yes. I have infused coconut oil. Currently I have love potion, God's green crack, and cherry pie. I have other strains coming in this week and can make a batch with another strain or oil if you prefer. You can DM for details or email sales@bakedgoods.shop
6968 2018-02-05 05:58:46 b) Commit a logical fallacy known as Tu quoque in an attempt to discredit an argument by asserting “you do it” (use oil, in this example). It’s essential a way to call someone a hypocrite, but has no bearing on the actual issue at hand.
6969 2018-02-05 05:58:05 So many conspiracy theories on the Right about the re-issue of the FISA warrant to monitor Carter Page, first targeted in 2013 for his Russian ties in oil & gas; they're pointing fingers at the FISA judge now. It'll hit them hard when the indictments come down. Tears will fall.

6974 2018-02-05 05:57:31 @SushmaSwaraj Marine express is oil tanker & there would have been oil spillage had it sunk. No distress signal indicates that there is foul play. I pray for safety of the crew & sure that innocents will be saved by you

6984 2018-02-05 05:56:18 #SolarEnergy is extremely important: it provides light for plants to photosynthesise, warms up the day and makes Earth habitable. Oil, gas and coal are like solar energy in a carbon bottle. And we get just a teeny fraction of its total output. Thank you, Sol!
6985 2018-02-05 05:55:56 As the post said: depends on your definition of swing.

No need to be a net exporter. Every barrel we don’t import is an extra barrel for the global export market. 

At the right price, US shale & oil inventories can cover most global (ex. Nigeria) outages with a reasonable lag.
6986 2018-02-05 05:55:53 I think Wayne & Garth would think our world is doomed because too many human beings treat it like a giant trash can. In other words, humans are doing too much to pollute it via oil spills, coal use, fracking,throwing trash in oceans, cutting down trees, etc #ClimateChangeIsReal
6987 2018-02-05 05:55:47 Lovely haha in my experience the best thing to do with road rash is let it dry out and it will heal in no time, if it does scar bio or rose hip oil with get rid of it  there is a way to keep it damp with less chance of scaring but it takes ages and is really annoying

7046 2018-02-05 05:43:02 We never fought for Nigeria. If you want to talk about the Civil War, its all about dominance. It's about political and oil control with the support of British. Beside that, no one bleed to have Nigeria. No Nigerian discover the name Nigeria. It's a given name. Dog tag!
7047 2018-02-05 05:42:48 try lavender oil n water mixed together in a spray bottle.. gets rid of many thi gs maybe ants too?
7048 2018-02-05 05:42:26 I always liked how many "no war for oil" protest signs could a liberal stuff into their SUV.
7049 2018-02-05 05:42:10 Maintain any upgrades receipts. Typical oil changes and maintenance won't do much but sometimes brand new tires and stuff will help increase your return. You might get more than the average too. 
7050 2018-02-05 05:41:43 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
7051 2018-02-05 05:41:26 Yep, more studies will cure the problem.
7052 2018-02-05 05:41:23 Global commodity prices have registered gains in 2017 with crude oil, metals and minerals, and energy registering gains of 15.7, 13.5, and 11.5 percent despite agriculture experiencing a decline of 2.1 percent as per the World Bank Commodity Prices Index. #CytonnReport
7053 2018-02-05 05:41:20 I’m gonna give it a try. I’ve been using jojoba and i think it was helping dark marks but for sure not helping with oil.

7071 2018-02-05 05:38:36 I wonder if you are talking about the largely accurate attacks, on Hillary from the left

Is it a lie that Clinton voted for & supported the Iraq war, sold the TPP as the "Gold Standard", was paid millions by the banks, pharmaceutical, insurance & oil industries through bundling?

7073 2018-02-05 05:38:22 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.

7082 2018-02-05 05:36:27 The nuns of Kerala use peppery coconut oil to ease the chafing of their wimples.

7094 2018-02-05 05:34:15 now THAT, is fake news.   false, false, false. 

Both are in fact good for you.  MCTs, Lauric acid, antimicrobial, antibacterial, raises good HDL, AND burns fat.  - Has to be from healthy cows, and buy organic, cold-pressed, non-deodorised coconut oil 4 those benefits.

7096 2018-02-05 05:33:56 A friend bought me some omega 3 milk and it turns out what that means is they put fucking FISH OIL in the milk. Dude
7097 2018-02-05 05:33:54 Tonight’s instant pot creation was steel cut oats with 2 cups oats, 4.5 cups water, 1st saute oats in avocado oil or butter. Add diced apples and dried fruit, coconut flakes, cinnamon, set to porridge for 12 minutes, natural release for 10 and wahla! Good healthy carb eating.
7098 2018-02-05 05:33:54 It’s pretty hard to get hydraulic fluid to burn. It has to withstand both high pressure and high heat and failures tend to spray out, so it’s almost always either water-based or mineral oil with additives that make it flame retardant.
7099 2018-02-05 05:33:48 Hahahaha! Oo nga ate e. Kung kelan naman papatulog na dun maman sufficient ang scalp oil. Asan ang hustisya? Huhu

Sear in a cast iron skillet to caramelize them, then throw the whole thing in the oven to roast! Easy! Delicious!

7113 2018-02-05 05:30:23 Without a functioning pipeline grid,  it is impossible to operate upstream and down stream sections of the oil and gas field & also, maintain functionality electric power distribution and generation.
7114 2018-02-05 05:30:15 On my recommendation to turn off MSM; Abe spouts the global 2% inflation figure that central banker groupthink espouses - Failed too many times to count.
Bankers set high targets for Oil; only after it rallies opposite of their downside targets -Sell signal? And I could go on...
7115 2018-02-05 05:30:14 it can't be emphasized enough how this new generation of young Ivy-League-trained GM's are wisely rejecting Boras' snake oil salesmanship. They don't want their owner to become the One Dumb Owner. Boras needs to back off & let his stars sign so the rest of the market will open up

7117 2018-02-05 05:29:36 it's very similar to caprylic/capric triglycerides which is that ingredient we see in soooooo many skin care products because it's so stable. Which is also a coconut oil derivative that's mixed with glycerin.

7120 2018-02-05 05:29:05 If I had an oil lantern, filled to its max, I’d burn it down to a 4th. Where sunlight comes for 15 minutes in winter months, I’d burn out and fall asleep in the embers of what was left. - JTP #winter #Poetry
7121 2018-02-05 05:28:58 Look, we believe in democracy.  And when people democratically vote to nationalize their oil, we need to give them a lesson in democracy by having them vote again.
And by that I mean we need a military coup.

7130 2018-02-05 05:27:37 He doesn’t care about DJT personally. He wants to weaken the west and the UN so no one can stop him from taking back the Ukraine. He wants a clear path for his oil. He wants to be the most powerful man in the world. With the West fractured he gets no pushback and goes unchecked.
7131 2018-02-05 05:27:24 Sad Sam nationalized oil for instance that is why he became a target
7132 2018-02-05 05:26:59 Will they even want/need our dirty oil now or  by the time pipeline built? We're living in the past.

7143 2018-02-05 05:24:59 If you deal w migraines, like me, cvs sells these gel cold packs for them. They work like a charm and they also got this lavender-rosemary oil foaming bath soak. 10/10 this is the most relaxed I’ve ever felt.

7157 2018-02-05 05:22:06 Not to mention the wars over oil, terrorism funded by the US and others to secure oil, or to protect marketshare by sabotaging the competition. I guess that's somehow funny, I don't find it funny.
7158 2018-02-05 05:22:03 Yes, Taste Tickler on Broadway/14th, order the Tickler, hold the mayo, add oil and vinegar

7172 2018-02-05 05:17:04 I'm done for the night but so far no matter what garbage you're sprouting it won't grow in oil. The birds, fish, insects, animals including us can't eat, drink or breath oil yet you continue to want us to. I can't for the life of me figure out why unless your invested in oil.
7173 2018-02-05 05:17:02 It helps India reduce oil import bill and also reduces ME power to fuel Wahabhi terrorism.

7184 2018-02-05 05:14:28 Talking rising oil prices is concern factor, raised fiscal deficit target, announced modi care but no roadmap. So global market will sharply recover in a few days but India is going to lose its premium in EMs.Thus there is visionary leader in center bt complete financial msmngmnt

7191 2018-02-05 05:13:33 I get the same about Canada. 

We have deserts.

We share the longest border in the world with our favorite neighbours, the USA.

We have the 3rd largest oil reserves in the world. Hands-off, America.

7198 2018-02-05 05:12:30 They won't send the tanks for the oil and fresh water but they will send them to rescue us when the jihadists and sharia law take over. There will be a stream of terrorists to the USA originating from canada and our govt loves them. Rather be American than live under sharia law

7201 2018-02-05 05:12:19 It certainly didn't start with the Minister calling Deniers that. It started with her being a blond woman, and trolls using that to criticize her because they don't like people who value science over the oil industry.

7204 2018-02-05 05:11:39 Only slightly more Portland would be an old Volvo wagon or a diesel Mercedes running on cooking oil.
7205 2018-02-05 05:11:21 We can't #hashtag our way out of problems. Our role as society is to learn from the mistakes of the past.  The water crisis, global warming, oil dependence, proliferation of nuclear are some of the stark warnings we are aware of but yet........we talk or tweet but no action taken
7206 2018-02-05 05:11:07 I wish I could have a constant IV of peppermint oil 

Once I figure out how to engineer a safe version of that it’s over for you folks
7207 2018-02-05 05:10:58 And they own the oil we pump out of the ground. Our economy sucks.
7208 2018-02-05 05:10:52 omg! yeah, don’t try that again. you can try coconut oil too. i use to use that like twice a week when my skin was really bad.
7209 2018-02-05 05:10:50 Can I still buy gear oil stock?
7210 2018-02-05 05:10:30 Why would you support importing oil from countries with human rights abuses such as Saudi Arabia and Nigeria?
7211 2018-02-05 05:10:25 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
7212 2018-02-05 05:10:19 oh yea def and i jus use a lol coconut oil in the winter cus i get exxxtra dry but shit i jus got a face wash wit glycolic acid im excited
7213 2018-02-05 05:10:10 No it doesnt,  you can actually try beard palm oil. It works perfectly
7214 2018-02-05 05:10:05 How about this..... we can sure make it tough to send anything they manufacture through Alberta. Clearly we need to get BC ndp and greens attention. They have no authority to stop our oil once its approved Federally!!!
7215 2018-02-05 05:09:57  follow the LOC method- Leave in conditioner, oil, then curling cream. I use Cantu leave in or sometimes blueberry bliss, then coconut oil or olive, then usually Shea Moisture curling smoothie
7216 2018-02-05 05:09:35 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.

7223 2018-02-05 05:09:00 Putting oil on the lamp posts are not nearly enough. Police should have been all hands on deck and mobilized prior to the game finishing.  This rioting bullshit even after your team won is stupid and now the city has to clean it up. I’d use any arrested to help with cleanup.
7224 2018-02-05 05:08:54 crisco didnt work

they used gear oil this time
7225 2018-02-05 05:08:53 Looks like an oil painting
7226 2018-02-05 05:08:32 i feel your pain!! tea tree oil works wonders after washing your face tho!
7227 2018-02-05 05:07:56 Why would you support importing oil from countries with human rights abuses such as Saudi Arabia and Nigeria?

7233 2018-02-05 05:06:40 just made friends with a boy in an overcrowded train. actually he said that I had put his favorite hair oil and I could also not resist to compliment his rupa banyan which was of my favorite color.
7234 2018-02-05 05:06:31 Rice! Just w/ a little turmeric and good extra virgin olive oil (a Picual from Chile, which I like because it's both very butter and has a nice peppery kick).

7239 2018-02-05 05:05:26 So many people have told me how great coconut oil is for your skin and removing makeup but I just actually tried it and WOW AMAZING
7240 2018-02-05 05:05:24 The people saying, "stop using oil than" don't make sense. Infrastructure was put in place for many energy conversions. Conversion must begin at infrastructure. Stop getting in way of the people conscious of climate issues. If there is better tech we should be using that as need.
7241 2018-02-05 05:05:10 Garnier Micellar Water to take makeup off, charcoal black sugar face scrub to exfoliate & take the dead skin/leftover oil off, & Olay Complete brightening moisturizer before bed. I used to break out bad until I started this. Haven't had a bad breakout since.
7242 2018-02-05 05:05:05 I changed the oil, oil filter & air filter in my 92 S-10. Time well spent!!
7243 2018-02-05 05:04:57 If they are not allowing the trans mountain pipeline thru then they are denying Alberta oil access. Hubby is in oil and he thinks you are a total idiot. Sorry

7245 2018-02-05 05:04:15 what do u expect from an American, they are number one in infringing of human rights, they police murder African Americans for being black, jail them to profit from prisons, invade countries for oil, America as zero credibility and should deal with @realDonaldTrump

7263 2018-02-05 05:00:19 And then fry with rice flour and tempura batter. Sauce is marinade reduced down with fried garlic and chili oil.

7270 2018-02-05 04:58:48 Finland is socialist is doing pretty well btw but they have the advantages of not having any oil and not being brown
7271 2018-02-05 04:58:43 I enjoy the variety that we've got these days. Growing up, it was Crisco or vegetable oil. 

Now, I have 3 or 4 different types for cooking, salads, veggies, etc.
7272 2018-02-05 04:58:20 I’m in desperate need of an oil change
7273 2018-02-05 04:57:59 Joe, you should sell snake oil - oh, I see you already are, nevermind.
7274 2018-02-05 04:56:57 On water vapor? 
Why not just drink gas or oil?
After all its natural right?
I mean it takes a bit to get it out of the ground but we can eat it too.
Like I said you are funnier then the flat earther.
7275 2018-02-05 04:56:40 I just want to be 18 so that i can take sleeping pills

'Cause obv inhaling insane amounts of lavender oil aint doing anything
7276 2018-02-05 04:56:25 They actually used MOTOR OIL
7277 2018-02-05 04:56:10 Ah yes ...a troubled mind uses filthy language when intelligent debate isn’t possible for you. We were discussing what you call oil sands environmental damage vrs BC destroying millions of acres of forests & U cant accept or defend, so the childish foul mouth

7281 2018-02-05 04:55:32 Ooooohh girl. Use Argan Oil 4RV or 5RV for the  b e s t  burgundy/violet color. Those were the best days of my hair life. I can't wear it bc my work is whack and said it looked too unnatural but the color is gorgeous and it'll take so well with your lighter hair.

7309 2018-02-05 04:51:00 I would like to thank @MINIUSA engineers for burying the oil filter in such a way that it is IMPOSSIBLE to get out without making a mess.  Do these people ever work on cars?  I thought the R53 was bad but the R56/R60 is worse.  Someone needs a ruler across the knuckles.

Mix 1 Tsp aloe vera gel, 1 Tsp petroleum jelly and 1/2 Tsp of coconut oil into a bowl
Heat in microwave for approximately 2 minutes
Let it fully cool before applying it to your lips
This gloss is a great moisturizer for your lips

7346 2018-02-05 04:44:48 Def not trying castor oil tho.
7347 2018-02-05 04:44:28 Drunk idiots, surrounded by a sea of people, climbing poles the police covered in oil-- what could possibly go wrong? #Philadelphia #Philly
7348 2018-02-05 04:44:12 Just stop please The name #Macedonia belongs to Greece, the word itself is Greek, that whole yugoslavian region was occupied by Greeks years before they arrived. All this because their is oil under GR shores which Russia and American governments want to mine and transport. 
7349 2018-02-05 04:44:06 Just heard on the Philly Police scanner: “they’re climbin on the light poles.” Even the hydraulic oil isn’t stopping them.

7366 2018-02-05 04:40:20 @ABC  Did you know that Type two diabetes has a number one cause, written by a medical researcher? He calls it Canadian ugly oil, made for machines. He blames the epidemic on Canola Oil directly. I can give the original article.

7371 2018-02-05 04:39:26 Just salt and olive oil on those bihs?
7372 2018-02-05 04:39:06 yep usually oil is used to get the nice crust but as for seasoning u just season 1 side if its a pretty thin cut of meat otherwise it becomes pretty salty but if its a nice thick cut you usually want to season both side. Marinated steak pat it dry first before searing.
7373 2018-02-05 04:39:04 普段コンビニでは、お箸やスプーン手拭き類は断ってるんだけど、ぼーっとしながらセブンで４つ入りのプリン買ったらスプーンが４本入ってて「シェアする人いないから、一人で食べるから・・・」ってかなりのダメージ与えられるな。

7380 2018-02-05 04:36:54 Perhaps more that it was killed by wealthy elites in Quebec that receive kickbacks from the Arabs, who pay the bribes to keep Alberta oil out. I can't prove it, but how else does what happened make sense?
7381 2018-02-05 04:36:45 These sound like *great* recommendations. Though you wouldn't want plain ground tea leaves as a coating. Maybe put it into turbinado, make a "tea sugar" like vanilla sugar? To extract just the oil but not keep the leaves/tannin.

7394 2018-02-05 04:34:17 Haha. Follow the oil money.
7395 2018-02-05 04:34:10 That oil is transported by rail from the port of Chicago after being off loaded from an OPEC tanker. Another arrives at Irving in NB.
7396 2018-02-05 04:34:06 Or, you know, a claim that he was offered a bribe of 1/5 of an oil company, worth €11b, was a ridiculous lie that didn't happen.
7397 2018-02-05 04:33:50 widd a oil change

7403 2018-02-05 04:32:27 Oh the poles were greased today. The rumour was they used motor oil or something like that instead of crisco. 

But it wasnt crisco related because people were climbing them two weeks ago too when they were covered in it.
7404 2018-02-05 04:32:11 It was gross. Old oil @DairyQueen winkler.

7414 2018-02-05 04:31:02 Yes it hurts like hell. No numbing cream. It hurts less the more you get it because there’s less growth. Eventually you get used to the pain. Feels like when you’re cooking and you have oil on a pan and some of that hot oil sprinkles in your skin

7419 2018-02-05 04:30:22 Moving oil by rail is expensive and rather less environmentally friendly than by pipeline though? This is why Energy East was the one that really should have gotten done. Kinder Morgan TM too, but Energy East just makes so much sense. Killed by bribes from the ME I think.
7420 2018-02-05 04:30:11 Justin needs to immediately balance our budget, not wait to 2055. Government debt increases inflation causing high debt payments. Unsustainable.

7428 2018-02-05 04:29:01 Again I'm only sharing facts you can check yourself. I would rather put my error on the safe side and give my grandchildren a better world to live in without oil and the added CO2 it gives off to. We will still be creating CO2 in other ways but, we also eliminate other pollutants

7439 2018-02-05 04:27:05 Before tonight, the last time the Eagles won the NFL title was 1960 when their coach was Buck Shaw, who coached Nevada from 1925-28. He went 10-20-3 before taking a job with an oil firm, never wanting to coach again. Life is weird.

7442 2018-02-05 04:26:00 Eastern Canada has already demonstrated that they would rather use Venezuelan oil to the tune of 750000 brls per day by ship, rather than western Canadian  oil extracted using the highest environmental standards in the world. So why should we continue the cycle of ridicule?
7443 2018-02-05 04:25:12 Try setting it on fire instead. I'm pretty sure oil is flammable.

7457 2018-02-05 04:22:42 The worst customer service I've ever come across. The engine of my BMW x5 2015 just suddenly stopped working and the reason I got from BMW is that there might be a delay in an oil change in 2016 when the car was almost brand new. Is This What we expect from BMW???@BMWUSA

7501 2018-02-05 04:16:33 It's been about OIL...Tillerson had done a huge deal w/Russians...Page told the Russians Tillerson would be a great Sec of State---my guess is that Russia offered to support Trump + good prices on lots of oil--if T would lift sanctions & keep his nose out of Ukraine. Hd 2 Prove.
7502 2018-02-05 04:16:26 Because we have the 3rd largest oil deposits on the planet. The USA achieves complete oil independence from OPEC. So it is only in this mixed up backward Canada that Alberta is a pariah.

7511 2018-02-05 04:14:54 Oil prices on Monday extended declines from the end of last week amid a wider market sell off and a stronger dollar, with Brent crude falling to its lowest in nearly a month.

7525 2018-02-05 04:13:07 Well what happened was like 200000-ish employees got laid off in the wake of oil prices crashing. Suicide spiked to insane amounts, it was brutal. They were told those careers were bullet proof. 

But yea, or knowing someone. Gotta get kinda lucky

7528 2018-02-05 04:12:38 They coated light poles with motor oil to keep people from climbing them. But isn't motor oil flammable?
7529 2018-02-05 04:12:38 Eventually it will. He's been playing 'favorites' with the States. Blue States are punished - hence we get oil rigs off-shore. He refused Federal funds for wildfires this summer - to BLUE states (eventually we got some) He's selling parks (Yosemite) to his friends..... etc.
7530 2018-02-05 04:12:10 I wonder if the oil kept the fans off the street lamps this time!
7531 2018-02-05 04:12:10 จริงค่ะ หลายรอบมากเลย นี่เห็นตลอดแต่ไม่ได้อะไร แต่ครั้งนี้ก็เกินไปแล้ว

7534 2018-02-05 04:11:34 Nice game! You forgot the 6 rigs up.. That will be in play tomorrow:)
7535 2018-02-05 04:11:31 So Cape Town, South Africa is running out of water on April 16th? Still no such thing as climate change? Can’t wait till we’re having war over water supplies instead of oil. 
7536 2018-02-05 04:11:29 That's nothing! I heard this tech is spreading like wild fire, like I mean big time. Like across the continent and all that ... I dunno, something called wi-fi... sounds more like sci fi to me. Nah, cable is here to stay friend. Where do these snake oil peddlers hang out nowadays
7537 2018-02-05 04:11:10 When I saw the preview for Al Bore’s “Convenient Half-truth” part II.....I was amazed that he could still pull this off considering how easy it is to expose his ties to big oil.

7539 2018-02-05 04:10:31 Not sure what you are thinking. How expensive that would be!!!  USA is a huge exporter of Oil thru pipelines and tankers.  Why would they even bother going that route. They have 100 of thousands of miles of pipelines. So does Canada.

7548 2018-02-05 04:09:10 Plenty of reasons to be sure, but main reason is that he was popular when crude prices were high and then not as popular once those prices fell (I have an old tweet somewhere showing parallel between approval ratings and oil prices).

7559 2018-02-05 04:07:49 People in India are fed up with the pollution of their air. They will be greatly impacted by climate change. I imagine that will be motivation for them to rely on oil as little as possible in the future. So I'm struggling to see the growth potential.
7560 2018-02-05 04:07:40 They just wasted good oil and grease
7561 2018-02-05 04:07:13 I’m pretty sure it’s a fallacy, because no matter how thinly I slice garlic it never “liquifies in the oil”, some magic fucking garlic there. Having said that I don’t want to wake up with concrete slippers, Uncle Paulie, so let’s just say I’m using the wrong knife.

7603 2018-02-05 04:00:30 I’ve seen the oil spills in the ocean off the US coast and I agree that they are disastrous, particularly for the wildlife. Maybe Canada has more stringent regulations. I just know there’s railcars carrying oil that regularly derail. Pipelines are far safer when regulated.
7604 2018-02-05 04:00:29 Haha they really thought oil was gonna stop the best fans in the world from climbing some poles#FlyEaglesFly

7614 2018-02-05 03:57:54 Neem leaf powder is a key ingredient in the tooth powder. If you've ever seen products with neem or neem oil in them they're priced so high! But the powder's cheap.
7615 2018-02-05 03:57:49 Typical tanker has one big engine. A fire or other problem and it is just a big oil filled bag heading for our shore. There is a freighter that happened to this week. Fortunately it was far enough offshore that a deep sea tug had time to get there.

7618 2018-02-05 03:57:16 Wouldn't it make more kitchen-table-budget sense to simply stop relying on the personal auto for transportation, & spend the money instead on infrastructure for alternative modes? Like bikes, water-bikes, canoes?

Bonus: reducing reliance on oil now could delay climate disasters.

theres enough of everything for everyone
people dont need much
but some people want everything
they can build pipelines to carry gas and oil
but cant manage to build one to carry clean water
equality isnt just male/female its person/person
7624 2018-02-05 03:56:35 These oil cleanse diffusers are 
L I F E 
7625 2018-02-05 03:56:34 Yes the Climate Alarmism hits us from every angle because every oil giant is heavily invested in going green. The name of the game is impending doom and the product is FEAR.
7626 2018-02-05 03:56:31 I’m like an essential oil freak.
7627 2018-02-05 03:56:25 แอร้ยยยย น่ารักอ่ะ
7628 2018-02-05 03:56:16 Tell us more about the nacho fries
7629 2018-02-05 03:56:10 Off any coast. Stop drilling altogether. Let us end the addiction to oil instead.
7630 2018-02-05 03:56:07 I just took the nicest shower w/ my face + body scrubs nd fancy lush soap!! I feel so CLEAN!! I’m about to put on body oil and feel even BETTER
7631 2018-02-05 03:55:59 นางชวนคุยด้วย นี่ก็จะเขินๆ หน่อย 555
7632 2018-02-05 03:55:58 I tried but couldn’t combine “win” and Browns.   It’s like they are water and oil 
7633 2018-02-05 03:55:49 Hai kak @amaazmi nak tanya boleh?
Semalam tengok ig story psl hemp seed oil. kak ama beli dekat mana ya?
7634 2018-02-05 03:55:45 What’s government doing for oil and gas industry... irritated getting no response on it @narendramodi @FinMinIndia its the worst quarter in terms of policies
7635 2018-02-05 03:55:40 Heard theres more oil on the poles in Philly than the middle east
7636 2018-02-05 03:55:33 Just another in a thousand instances of the ugliest aspect of unfettered capitalism which is that it absolves the businessman of guilt as he/she goes about seeking success.  Exploiting MLK Is nothing compared to what oil or drug companies do but it is the same ethical license.
7637 2018-02-05 03:55:33 隣に座らせてくださいw
7638 2018-02-05 03:55:30 I hide my age well. I bathe in Oil of Olay. 
7639 2018-02-05 03:55:28 our wife just secreted canola oil. you know that
7640 2018-02-05 03:55:22 The Philadelphia police department covered the who city in motor oil. No chance Philadelphia is here tomorrow.
7641 2018-02-05 03:55:21 ชอบพี่แหม่ม
7642 2018-02-05 03:55:17 The rain washed away all the oil on the poles! And now the rain has stopped! #SuperBowlChampions #FlyEaglesFly #SBLII #FlyPhillyFly #DillyPhilly
7643 2018-02-05 03:55:10 เห็นพอดีเลยค่ะพี่ออย ไม่โอเคมากๆอะ คิดว่าขอโทษก็จบงี้
7644 2018-02-05 03:55:10 インフル流行りまくり@会社
7645 2018-02-05 03:55:04 It has. The big issue to me is that once the oil is on the ships, the pipeline companies and oil producers wash their hands. Accidents are the shipping companies problem. They just reflag and walk away. Study the Marathassa spill in Vancouver. Tiny spill. Avoiding liability.
7646 2018-02-05 03:55:02 They used gear oil this time and it did jack shit LOL
7647 2018-02-05 03:54:54 JZ cool he just thinks the oil light is on
7648 2018-02-05 03:54:29 An idiot deep frying a turkey, without measuring how much oil to put into the pot. Typical southern Thanksgiving Day.
7649 2018-02-05 03:54:06 Ordered 12 tacos, received 24 for the price of 12. Also, car ran out of oil - 2 litres disappeared over 2000 miles
7650 2018-02-05 03:53:54 But Russia is big oil, so...
7651 2018-02-05 03:53:47 I was thinking of putting it on top of toast with a little olive oil and then putting a pooched egg on top of that. Let that yolk drip down with the first cut. :3
7652 2018-02-05 03:53:44 Hey, y’all do your thing. I was reading they cops put oil and shit all over the poles to try and keep y’all off. 
7653 2018-02-05 03:53:30 skin care freaks: should i put on my acne cream before or after my argan oil
7654 2018-02-05 03:53:29 I’m so jealous how easily Wesley can oil pull. I gag every time 
7655 2018-02-05 03:53:26 Do you happen to be a consumer of oil and gas
7656 2018-02-05 03:53:22 Salute to many philly goons who got they beard drenched in Shea Moisture oil right now !
7657 2018-02-05 03:53:10 Yes, you can get into information overload.......sometimes I'll see chigirl or goldmarketgirl make comments about gold or oil and I want to move in that direction but I don't know enough about it, but they know a great deal.

7659 2018-02-05 03:53:02 Well, they used motor oil
7660 2018-02-05 03:52:57 Philly is using hydraulic fluid on their poles.  Should use gear oil. Stuff smells and they would stink for a couple of days.
7661 2018-02-05 03:52:50 เท่าไรคะ
7662 2018-02-05 03:52:38 The 3 in of snow on the ground and the 3 more on the way better be enough for my gym classes to be cancelled tomorrow or i s2g i will draw satanic symbols on all campus building with red oil pastel very small, near the cornerstones, just to freak ppl OUT

7664 2018-02-05 03:51:54 I didn't even know who was in the #SuperBowlLll till yesterday  Bae and me just finished a hot oil hair treatment, now we watching horror movies 
7665 2018-02-05 03:51:45 Sometimes feel like it's the entire basis of our current economy, i.e., selling tech snake oil to people who won't be able to figure out how to use it effectively.
7666 2018-02-05 03:51:05 Well....she can forget about pole dancing to celebrate. They coated them with hydraulic oil.
7667 2018-02-05 03:51:01 ไม่มีไอดีนี้จริงค่ะ เขาเมคขึ้นมา

7671 2018-02-05 03:50:25 As per the 5th of February 2018, the Oil Archetype Index does not indicate a BUY signal for the oil price
7672 2018-02-05 03:50:04 It's motor oil, so...
7673 2018-02-05 03:50:02 おにぎりワッショイ
7674 2018-02-05 03:50:00 yeah man. its oil.
7675 2018-02-05 03:49:59 motor oil this time, or so rumor has it
7676 2018-02-05 03:49:36 #ProverbOfTheDay 5:3 The lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil.But the result is as bitter as poison, sharp as a double-edged sword.
7677 2018-02-05 03:49:27 mahalllll hemp seed hahahaha mampu jojoba oil je tapi jarang tempek kat muka sobs
7678 2018-02-05 03:49:23 They put motor oil on the poles 
7679 2018-02-05 03:49:23 Perhaps in the US. In Canada most transport trains carry oil. There’s a minimum of 2 derailments/year. Last pipeline leak in Canada? Decades ago.
7680 2018-02-05 03:49:21 Coconut Oil fixes everything, don’t argue with me.
7681 2018-02-05 03:49:15 AMTRAK? steel wheels on steel rails hitting a similar freight train. I feel like this is 1870. Want to spend $1tr on infrastructure? MAGLEV. And give the builders the same rights to access property as the oil companies have
7682 2018-02-05 03:49:09 Oh yeah, I have a nintendo switch cart of Mario Oddsey, who wants to see me record a video of me tasting it because I heard that game's oil is worse than the other games. ;p

7685 2018-02-05 03:48:56 I hope he enjoyed that feeling before the release of the actual memo killed it. Kind of like a metaphor for Trump's presidency. They're all bad snake oil salesmen.
7686 2018-02-05 03:48:50 Coconut oil 
7687 2018-02-05 03:48:31 How many places have the equipment required to process our oil? Basically 2 places the US Gulf and China. It seems China has all the oil it needs from Russia. We aren't gaining marketshare.
7688 2018-02-05 03:48:29 That oil paint effect superb..
I feel so low....no news of Barun..

7710 2018-02-05 03:45:10 Hell yea. Was worried the oil tank would get too hot and melt the glue. But it’s been through hell since @EXXXOTICA  Chicago still holding on
7711 2018-02-05 03:45:01 Seriously good thing they put hydraulic oil on the poles. This crowd could best the Crisco. #SBLII

7714 2018-02-05 03:44:49 Neither rain, nor sleet, nor crisco, nor oil shall keep the people of Philly from making decisions in celebration that sound good in theory.. but.......

7718 2018-02-05 03:43:50 They put motor oil on them today

7730 2018-02-05 03:42:30 They are using hydraulic oil.
7731 2018-02-05 03:42:10 My goal is to remove all products containing palm oil from my diet. All palm plantations require destruction of biodiverse tropical forests. Use oils grown in the #USA
7732 2018-02-05 03:42:10 They were applying motor oil to the light poles this morning!!! MOTOR OIL!
7733 2018-02-05 03:42:00 I think this time they actually greased the polls with motor oil

7740 2018-02-05 03:41:44 On the front page of the Observer the former head of the civil service Andrew Turnbull compares Brexiters to Nazis. On Peston his successor Gus O’Donnell called Leavers “completely crazy” snake oil salesmen.
But there's no bias in the civil service, yeah right!
7741 2018-02-05 03:41:27 Took a tea tree oil bath, currently drinking sangria, eating frozen thin mints and listening to Olivia O’Brien.... still happily dating myself.
7742 2018-02-05 03:41:20 Every ounce of flesh they could get back is still less than what was taken by Philip Morris in the first place.  It is relevant because I expect when climate change really starts impacting us we will be forced to act and the oil company tantrum will likely be the same as PM's.
7743 2018-02-05 03:40:59 so, no more saudi oil?  that is going to be tough out there.

7756 2018-02-05 03:39:18 You see they used motor oil today instead of spam or whatever it was after the nfc title game?
7757 2018-02-05 03:39:15 Hi Katie, we became a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in 2010. The palm oil used in our own branded food products supports the production of certified sustainable palm oil. We've committed to using 1/3

7774 2018-02-05 03:36:26 There is an #Eagles fan climbing up a traffic pole that has been greased up with motor oil on Walnut & Broad St, damn he’s strong enough to stay up there. 
7775 2018-02-05 03:36:23 I need someone who’s gonna change my oil for me bc I’m 1,200 miles overdue right now so obviously i can’t be trusted to bring it somewhere when i need to.
7776 2018-02-05 03:36:21 I lost money but I bet that motor oil still isn’t slippery enough to stop the Eagles fans from climbing on the light polls. #moneymoves
7777 2018-02-05 03:36:20 แค่หาบัตรก็ยากละนา 55555 นี่ยังมาทะเลาะกันอีก

7779 2018-02-05 03:35:42 Celebrating a philly win with a lavender oil treatment in my hair. Basically a better way to say I’m going to bed tonight looking like the Fonz.  Heeeeeyyyyyy

7781 2018-02-05 03:35:36 Start dandelion root tea,  black seed oil mixed with water. Chemo and radiation won't work
7782 2018-02-05 03:35:35 Im geeked we got our holy oil. My spirits uplifted!!!
7783 2018-02-05 03:35:19 "Wait...baby oil? AAAAGGGHHH!!!"
- The first thing that comes to my mind whenever someone mentions Joe Don Baker
7784 2018-02-05 03:35:08 Lol probably, good thing they put motor oil on the street poles
7785 2018-02-05 03:34:58 The Patriots defense is HORRIBLE. Especially on 3rd downs and giving up big plays. Congrats to home grown Noles. I didn't think he could handle the main stage and I salute Tom Brady for playing his heart out like always. Excellent game...I was entertained.
7786 2018-02-05 03:34:54 You can see all the fingerprints and oil marks on the trophy right now lol
7787 2018-02-05 03:34:52 Putin also doesn't want us to be energy independent, and continue our turnaround in the oil industry.
7788 2018-02-05 03:34:52 there’s oil in the midwest now...
7789 2018-02-05 03:34:42 Kak iman nak pakai tea tree oil after toner or before toner?
7790 2018-02-05 03:34:41 Considering they covered all the poles in motor oil instead of crisco this week...
7791 2018-02-05 03:34:37 They used hydraulic oil this time, is that flammable?
7792 2018-02-05 03:34:14 えっ、錯誤ってこんなめんどくさかったんや
7793 2018-02-05 03:33:58 I just put face moisturizer in my mf hair bc I thot I grabbed my Argan oil yikes
7794 2018-02-05 03:33:54 #Patriots fans whining about refs is like Oil Company Billionaires whining about Republicans.
7795 2018-02-05 03:33:45 So did they fill the oil pressure in the tires to make the home run and get the flat Stanley cup? What's going on brother ? I'm confused.
7796 2018-02-05 03:33:45 They put motor oil on post so people won’t try to climb them. But all they need is a match 
7797 2018-02-05 03:33:43 Not only did I spill oil on my floor, I then accidentally stepped on it & made half the bottle come out ...
7798 2018-02-05 03:33:27 amen.
7799 2018-02-05 03:33:25 grace like oil
7800 2018-02-05 03:33:20 True...that motor oil they greased the street posts with is highly flammable!
7801 2018-02-05 03:33:16 Leave it to me to eat kissable massage oil 
7802 2018-02-05 03:33:12 โอ๊ยยย อยากมิ้วแต่ก็อยากรู้ว่าสองคนนั้นจะตกลงกันยังไง ความเผือกของกูนี่นะ
7803 2018-02-05 03:33:09 Questions after the #SuperBowl: will the crisco and/or baby oil hold off the fans? Will the city burn to the ground? Will they finally free @MeekMill?
7804 2018-02-05 03:32:43 A QWISO or ISO kinda oil? They can be done safely inside.
7805 2018-02-05 03:32:31 Lol, the used hydraulic oil
7806 2018-02-05 03:32:19 That's why they didn't use oil this time. :)
7807 2018-02-05 03:32:17 I don't want to buy one. I just want to make fun of you for complaining about it while using a smart device that was built in China and sent over on a ship powered by Bunker Oil which definitely kills more fish than a Jeep.
7808 2018-02-05 03:32:16 "I should've drank more snake oil."
7809 2018-02-05 03:32:08 I need the audio of people trying to claim the motor oil drench light poles
7810 2018-02-05 03:32:06 they put motor oil on the lampposts because crisco didn’t work last time which means the city is just extra flammable
7811 2018-02-05 03:32:03 "It smells like cardamom oil." -Jesse
7812 2018-02-05 03:31:58 The Eagles cheated lol.  The refs gave the two controversial calls to the Eagles and were smiling in the end zone   . Had this been reversed and the Patriots won w/two controversial calls ....you already know. Yes, I'm being salty. Good game though......
7813 2018-02-05 03:31:58 It’s hydraulic fluid. I’m pretty sure motor oil is a health hazard.
7814 2018-02-05 03:31:50 accurate
7815 2018-02-05 03:31:34 Just don’t be climbing any poles covered in oil, grease or whatever lubricant they used.
7816 2018-02-05 03:31:16 もこみちんww
素晴らしいです(о´∀`о)
7817 2018-02-05 03:31:13 You just know some Eagles fan is out in Philadelphia climbing those poles covered with motor oil in their prized jersery. They will then frame that grease-stained jersery and hang it proudly in their home.
7818 2018-02-05 03:31:10 They switched to motor oil 
7819 2018-02-05 03:30:44 Baby oil is not made out of babies. Just a tip from ya girl.
7820 2018-02-05 03:30:43 OIL DIFF: 3.33 -> 3.36
7821 2018-02-05 03:30:30 I used to love Pepsi but you prioritize profits by sourcing Conflict Palm Oil instead of protecting people, wildlife and the planet so I can't buy your products anymore. You can change.
7822 2018-02-05 03:30:05 February 04, 2018 at 10:30PM Waiting for #Ecuador to admit Petroecuador oil spills
7823 2018-02-05 03:29:59 I would be so pissed if I was just coming in for an oil changed and you made me get all unscheduled emotional
7824 2018-02-05 03:29:28 2 tbsp coconut oil, some turmeric, and 1/4 cup popcorn kernels. Let it head up on high saute, until the test kernels pop, then throw it in and clap the top on until it stops popping.
7825 2018-02-05 03:29:19 @LBC Darren, I smoke all day, every day, heavy on the oil rig, and yet, I am rather productive.  Hence, your immediate caller, William, is little more than a biased idiot.
7826 2018-02-05 03:29:19 Either they are frying themselves in Crisco or burning it down with motor oil. Hopefully my god mother doesn't have to work tomorrow cause Philly may not be there.
7827 2018-02-05 03:29:11 PUT CRISCO AND MOTOR OIL ON THAT SUPER BOWL TROPHY!!! #FlyEaglesFly #SuperBowlChamps
7828 2018-02-05 03:29:08 Nah turn a blind eye, they have too much Oil and money. Why criticize be like Trump a hypocrite.
7829 2018-02-05 03:29:02 there's motor oil on the streetlights in Philly 
7830 2018-02-05 03:28:33 Brushing my teeth with coconut oil
7831 2018-02-05 03:28:19 I want to throw myself into boiling oil

7835 2018-02-05 03:27:58 sprinkled lavender oil on my pillow because I love and cherish me
7836 2018-02-05 03:27:41 I hate the Eagles as much as the next Steelers fan, but goddamn if it doesn't feel good to see a snake oil salesman and a trump financer lose #fucktombrady #flyeaglesflyjustfortonight
7837 2018-02-05 03:27:40 There's a HUGH volcano under that land, FRACKING..have those oil people lost their minds?
7838 2018-02-05 03:27:29 My mom found our anointing oil, the smell alone brings back so much comforting memories.

7843 2018-02-05 03:27:00 It is!  But all the poles are covered in motor oil 
7844 2018-02-05 03:26:55 Philly is going to go bananas, motor oil in poles? #Challengeaccepted #SuperBowl
7845 2018-02-05 03:26:53 No amount of Crisco Oil will keep those light poles in Philly safe tonight. #SuperBowl2018
7846 2018-02-05 03:26:52 The Browns are fixing to throw stupid oil money at Foles lol.
7847 2018-02-05 03:26:38 10時間もかかったのかアローラ旅行・・・
7848 2018-02-05 03:26:28 Moment of truth.... will the people of Philadelphia be able to conquer the motor oil like they did the Crisco? #SBLll #PhiladelphiaEagles
7849 2018-02-05 03:26:17 They use hydraulic oil Environmentally safe hydraulic oil

7854 2018-02-05 03:25:48 Is anyone taking C60 in olive oil if so how much daily?
7855 2018-02-05 03:25:48 Historian, 2030: "After the rioters had consumed Phildelphia in flames, they took the momentum to other cities."

*tosses another board into the oil drum fire*

"We thought the Criscoed poles were a joke, but that was just the least of what they were capable of."
7856 2018-02-05 03:25:46 Los ameeicanos siguen siendo los principales compradores del oil venezolano... no jodamos
7857 2018-02-05 03:25:45 i’ll bring the motor oil
7858 2018-02-05 03:25:43 I think it would be oil, but if the creators would want to be more realistic they could put a layer of blood in between the "skin" and machinery.

7860 2018-02-05 03:25:34 I don’t change my own oil.
7861 2018-02-05 03:25:24 Hydraulic oil sales are up per source. #Eagles
7862 2018-02-05 03:25:24 ไปหาหมอ เป็นไรอ่ะ
7863 2018-02-05 03:25:23 BRB GONNA GO CLIMB SOME MOTOR-OIL-SLATHERED LAMPPOSTS NOW  #SBLII
7864 2018-02-05 03:25:08 His other disadvantage is he doesn’t posses the same slick as snot, disingenuous, snake oil charm that ,s has. Some of the ladies really go for ’s. But if you want genuine, enduring, professional & compassionate Bill’s a good choice.
7865 2018-02-05 03:25:06 Seen where Philly put baby oil on the light poles so people couldn’t climb them 
7866 2018-02-05 03:25:03 They coated light posts with motor oil lol.....so the city could actually burn

7869 2018-02-05 03:24:52 O metodo q eu uso chama “oil cleansing method” (ocm) a limpeza é feita com óleo vegetal (natural e puro). Revezo usando espuma de limpeza, agr to usando uma da marca nupill. Qnd faço os dois chama “double cleansing” :) da uma olhada dps, pra mim e outros q conheço deu mto certo.
7870 2018-02-05 03:24:47 I wanted the Eagles to win and they did.  N. E. has won so often, and thought it might be time for the Eagles to win.
7871 2018-02-05 03:24:45 They were using motor oil lol
7872 2018-02-05 03:24:42 Mas mabango,mas gwapo/maganda! 25% oil based perfume...maganda sya pangregalo!
7873 2018-02-05 03:24:42 You could say....overinflated balls...
You know...make it more relatable
7874 2018-02-05 03:24:33 The city that has to douse their Street pokes with crisco and motor oil just won the Super Bowl. Puke city.
7875 2018-02-05 03:24:28 
7876 2018-02-05 03:24:27 Ye fam nothing suspicious about 19% stake of nationally owned oil company being privatized to a series of shell corporations in the Caymans. Not like the Dossier said something like that could be made available if sanctions were lifted...
7877 2018-02-05 03:24:26 Well he doesn’t put much effort in the juicing, but thc oil helps him with the pain side effects. Also one thing I would recommend is GET A SECOND CANCER DOCTOR OPINION!
7878 2018-02-05 03:24:23 I wonder how those light posts that Philadelphia city staff were covering with MOTOR OIL earlier today will survive the evening.
7879 2018-02-05 03:24:21 These are their donors! The GOP will be expecting big kickbacks from their donor supporters.  Crazy what Zinke and others are getting from cattle, oil, mineral, lumber people and others. Robbing us, the people, up one side and down the other! Over the table/under the table...
7880 2018-02-05 03:24:07 Watch out for the poles with the motor oil smeared on them.
7881 2018-02-05 03:24:02 #SuperBowl @Eagles let's see how well hydraulic oil stops fans...
7882 2018-02-05 03:24:02 If I was a philly fan I’d climb a light pole, get my jersey covered in oil, and frame that oil covered jersey as a great reminder of winning the Super Bowl.
7883 2018-02-05 03:24:02 see, some people used motor oil to grease the poles so i can't rule out the phanatic being on fire
7884 2018-02-05 03:23:37 Looking for the music. Dude, street bike gang leader guy just waterboarded a guy using motor oil.
7885 2018-02-05 03:23:34 Niggas blow me how you flexing your turbo bmw like you bulit it, ya car come fast stock, its auto, and you aint never pick a wrench up ! Niggas dont even change they own oil. I aint saying you can feel cool cause ya whip cool but dont flex like you the biggest thing.
7886 2018-02-05 03:23:30 They used motor oil this time!
7887 2018-02-05 03:23:29 First the 666, now the Patriots losing :) The oil bulls are about 4th & 65. Now we sack em :)
7888 2018-02-05 03:23:29 GOOD LUCK WITH THE MOTOR OIL PHILLY. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED AND DEFEATED YES
7889 2018-02-05 03:23:28 They will grease them with cooking oil like they did 2 weeks ago.
7890 2018-02-05 03:23:26 Well now we get to see pole covered in motor oil Vs. drunken eagles fans. Who didn’t want to see that match up?
7891 2018-02-05 03:23:26 The plan to put motor oil on the poles is about to backfire! That city is gonna burn to the ground
7892 2018-02-05 03:23:25 They painted them with hydraulic oil today
7893 2018-02-05 03:23:23 I got this peppermint oil on my head and it feels insane.
7894 2018-02-05 03:23:19 Alaskans own 4,973,717 shares of SAIPEM SPA, worth $2,263,506. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in ITALY.
7895 2018-02-05 03:23:16 ちょっと調べて視野を広げてみますねｗ
7896 2018-02-05 03:22:50 Well don't worry  the police put  oil  the lightpost. will be difficult to climb
7897 2018-02-05 03:22:43 Those light poles in Philadelphia better have Crisco, Quaker State and every other kind of oil on them cause they may burn Philly down tonight
7898 2018-02-05 03:22:40 Hydraulic oil this time!
7899 2018-02-05 03:22:36 Now we get to find out if the hydraulic oil works or not!

#dontclimbpoleseaglesfans
7900 2018-02-05 03:22:32 Now the real test... will motor oil stop philly fans?
7901 2018-02-05 03:22:26 “Oh God. The oil we put on the light poles was FLAMMABLE!!!!”
7902 2018-02-05 03:22:19 Especially with the oil on the light poles!
7903 2018-02-05 03:22:17 need video of the jokers in philly climbing the motor oil greased poles immediately
7904 2018-02-05 03:22:17 They coated light poles in Philly with motor oil to keep people off them. My first thought was, "great, they gave them flammable materials". #Super Bowl
7905 2018-02-05 03:22:14 Yes... using hydraulic oil now!

7908 2018-02-05 03:22:09 They put motor oil on the poles instead of crisco today.
7909 2018-02-05 03:22:05 A video was posted earlier. The city was spraying the poles with a oil mix hahahaha
7910 2018-02-05 03:22:02 OMG KA PICK YOU REALLY NEED  AN OIL PAPER!!!!

7916 2018-02-05 03:21:35 I think down prob
7917 2018-02-05 03:21:25 Coconut oil or cocoa butter
7918 2018-02-05 03:21:22 Go, #Eagles, Go!!! I guess Tom Brady's #alkalinediet wasn't enough. #SuperBowl Let's hope that that would dissuade a least a few of buying his Brady's snake oil! #PatriotsvsEagles #Patriots #AlkalineFoods
7919 2018-02-05 03:21:22 So it was funny that they put deer oil on lamp posts to keep people from climbing them but is that shit flammable? #SuperBowl

7921 2018-02-05 03:21:08 Motor oil is flammable....
7922 2018-02-05 03:20:53 Y’all text me when the motor oil is lit
7923 2018-02-05 03:20:53 Get the Crisco out! It's time to oil up the light poles! #Eagles #SuperBowl
7924 2018-02-05 03:20:46 I went to a shop someone told me about. Great products and blooms. Downfall it's 20 minutes south of me.worth the drive tho. Great deals!pd $44 for all. Have card no tax I'm going to try making oil just afraid of blowin shit uplike my house
7925 2018-02-05 03:20:41 It didn’t work last time. They went with motor oil this time

7928 2018-02-05 03:20:39 Motor oil in Philly
7929 2018-02-05 03:20:37 Global demand is already falling relative to population. AB could be a leader in geothermal electricity generation development. I'd like to see a much more ambitious plan, one that spends more to develop the tech that will make oil obsolete sooner.
7930 2018-02-05 03:20:31 Brady sucks because he’s an unscientific prick that pedals snake oil cures and acts like god’s gift.  If that fumble is the reason for his loss, then ‘bah gawd,’ make it so
7931 2018-02-05 03:20:21 Good job #eagles your city needed this. 

Don't light the motor oil coated light posts on fire, but enjoy.

7933 2018-02-05 03:20:16 Holy crap. Now praying for center city. There isn't enough oil in the world for those lampposts.

7935 2018-02-05 03:20:13 Ok motor oil in Philly: it’s YOUR turn
7936 2018-02-05 03:20:09 I guess we’ll learn how the Philadelphia PD coating the lamp posts in motor oil works.
7937 2018-02-05 03:20:04 sharing your coconut oil recipes i hope too!!
7938 2018-02-05 03:19:57 Kind of like the oil bulls 
7939 2018-02-05 03:19:56 I dunno, they put transmission oil on the posts. Ever get that shit on your hands before?
7940 2018-02-05 03:19:40 Lubed with motor oil or not, I’d hate to be a street sign or traffic signal in Philly tonight.  Congrats @Eagles
7941 2018-02-05 03:19:40 No amount of motor oil is stopping Eagles fans tonight
7942 2018-02-05 03:19:35 油を英訳するとオイル、オイルを和訳すると油。友達です。  @ABURA_elf
7943 2018-02-05 03:19:34 no amount of Crisco or motor oil is saving Philly tonight.
7944 2018-02-05 03:19:31 Better oil up those light poles philly
7945 2018-02-05 03:19:31 Love it
7946 2018-02-05 03:19:28 There’s no amount of motor oil going to save those poles in Minnesota tonight #FlyEagelsFly #SuperBowlLll
7947 2018-02-05 03:19:25 Nick Foles Awsome  #NFL #BBCNFL #SuperBowlLll
7948 2018-02-05 03:19:23 whale oil: highly explosive
me: throw it
ytuber: actually throws it n kills piere in one hit, resulting in a game over

sick !
7949 2018-02-05 03:19:21 @alicianpadron philly better oil those poles  #eagles
7950 2018-02-05 03:19:17 LMAO ... it's crisco oil time
7951 2018-02-05 03:19:16 みっちゃん脅すときのしきしげほぼ笑ってるけど笑ってない…現がいるときは大丈夫だ！大丈夫なはずだ！
7952 2018-02-05 03:19:11 It’s an oil now
7953 2018-02-05 03:19:06 I guess Brady shoulda had more of that snake oil he's peddlin' #superbowl
7954 2018-02-05 03:19:00 (#^-^)ﾒﾗ…ﾒﾗ…ﾒﾗ…
7955 2018-02-05 03:18:57 Well, we'll now see if Eagles fans can climb poles laden with hydraulic oil as well as they handled Crisco. Stay safe, folks! #SuperBowl
7956 2018-02-05 03:18:57 Haha. #Superbowl showed us a stong resilient @lindseyvonn, then #JustinTimberlake ogle every woman in the club. @mattdamon supporting clean water, then @Jeep running a gas and oil vehicle through a river and waterfall.  #contradiction
7957 2018-02-05 03:18:54 Well we can all say goodbye to Philadelphia... good luck motor oil
7958 2018-02-05 03:18:50 Secretary of Snake Oil
7959 2018-02-05 03:18:49 They used gear oil instead of crisco tonight 
7960 2018-02-05 03:18:48 なで催でも無理なものは無理か・・・
7961 2018-02-05 03:18:38 Is there an essential oil for oxygen? I need some....
7962 2018-02-05 03:18:34 Olive oil and pasta time I ship it @OvileeMay @Pastrytime
7963 2018-02-05 03:18:26 motor oil is NO MATCH
7964 2018-02-05 03:18:20 Good luck with that motor oil, Philadelphia
7965 2018-02-05 03:18:17 Applying hydraulic oil on the light posts in Philadelphia may be a bad idea. Sure you can't climb them but they sure will burn easier.
7966 2018-02-05 03:17:52 Philly is going to go ballistic. Motor oil or not, the crowd is going to climb those lampposts! #FlyEaglesFly
7967 2018-02-05 03:17:36 You have no idea what you are talking about!

Norman French is spoken by less than 110k people globally

We have ZERO heritage of Modern French language in the UK except in the Diplomatic Corps!

We've appropriated some French words but very little survives from the Langue d'oil
7968 2018-02-05 03:17:22 Reminder: in downtown Philly they have motor oil on their street poles to stop people from climbing on them.
7969 2018-02-05 03:17:18 When u gotta put a towel over your neck bc this oil doesn’t knw how to sink into your scalp & instead trickles all over your neck 
7970 2018-02-05 03:17:08 Try peppermint oil
7971 2018-02-05 03:16:56 They went with motor oil tonight
7972 2018-02-05 03:16:55 Tea tree oil
7973 2018-02-05 03:16:44 They’ve already put hydraulic oil on the poles in Philly so people can’t climb them lmaooooo
7974 2018-02-05 03:16:42 Gear oil.
7975 2018-02-05 03:16:34 มีคนชมนิชเยอะเลย ปริ่ม
7976 2018-02-05 03:16:17 Stuffing made from chopped chestnut, chestnut purée, pumpkin spiced fried leeks and garlic, fresh parsley, olive oil
7977 2018-02-05 03:16:13 Gear oil I hope?
7978 2018-02-05 03:15:57 I heard it’s motor oil now
7979 2018-02-05 03:15:27 Thanks ant...some stocks I personally like are keane group, C&J energy services, crescent point energy, baytex energy, WPX energy..i really like the oil service space especially pressure pumping stocks.
7980 2018-02-05 03:15:19 Delicious Greek meatball slices with artichoke and garlic and Italian seasoning and romano. With garlic oil on the crust and well done. Bellasemo. 
7981 2018-02-05 03:15:17 Oh, my pleasure. Just apply 1 drop to each breakout. A little goes a long way. Mix with coconut oil or any other oil if the smell is too strong. 
7982 2018-02-05 03:15:10 Someone better oil up the Philadelphia telephone poles
7983 2018-02-05 03:14:53 Praying his tea tree oil bath helped. By the sign of the amount of snot I'd say it did.  I would take this 10x over again before my baby has to suffer
7984 2018-02-05 03:14:52 Motor oil tonight...
7985 2018-02-05 03:14:42 Brady CHOKED , Eagles got this win #BBCNFL #SuperBowlLII
7986 2018-02-05 03:14:24 if you dab oil off your pizza you’re weak and natural selection will deal with you
7987 2018-02-05 03:14:08 No - I use zero oil in anything. I don’t miss oily food at all.
7988 2018-02-05 03:13:58 So did all the #Patriots dip their hands in canola oil before the game or...
7989 2018-02-05 03:13:56 eh of course Peter Thiel is a shitstain but it's hardly a matter of major concern to me which things accepted funding rounds from an investment firm linked to him? That slope would be nothing but oil?
7990 2018-02-05 03:13:44 If you are serious about climate change then they can't expand. It's that simple. We can keep fucking around with oil or we can get serious, we've opted to keep fucking around, because it's politically easier.
7991 2018-02-05 03:13:41 BP admitted that there would likely be stranded assets (oil left in the ground). Huge statement from BigOil.
7992 2018-02-05 03:13:34 YOUR ROBOT BRADY IS OUTTA OIL!!!!
7993 2018-02-05 03:13:27 48 seconds left. NE is 3&10 with 90+ yads needed, plus the 2 point conversion. It's over. NE lost :)

7995 2018-02-05 03:13:20 Most of the people in N Dakota right now are not FROM N Dakota.  Oil workers from elsewhere.
7996 2018-02-05 03:13:20 追いオリーブもいいけど、追いフォローもよろしくな。
7997 2018-02-05 03:13:03 Objective by Kevin Hague? Oh piss off. Scotland is an extremely asset rich country. Why the panic in 2014 when 1 poll favoured Yes? OK oil has dropped but slowly rising again. Brexit a disaster waiting to happen.
7998 2018-02-05 03:13:02 You know it’s getting hot out side when your coconut oil starts liquefying 
7999 2018-02-05 03:13:00 You would be a person to mix sports and politics, like mixing oil and water it just doesnt work
8000 2018-02-05 03:12:48 Have fun climbing up those motor oil lubed street poles eagles fans
8001 2018-02-05 03:12:40 They used gear oil this time. ;) crisco failed.
8002 2018-02-05 03:12:39 It kinda hurt to spray oil on it..
8003 2018-02-05 03:12:31 I made brownies but I used some slightly bad oil

and they're terrible
8004 2018-02-05 03:12:30 Thank you - God planned it for this dayWhen our time is up We have to be ready Have our oil lamps full and wicks trimmed

IJNA
8005 2018-02-05 03:12:27 The environment is one of my two BIG concerns.  Much of what's happening is administrative & can be reversed.  However, he's planning on selling off our National lands for mineral & coal exploration; has already signed order f/oil drilling off shores -EXCEPT Florida & Mar-a-lago!
8006 2018-02-05 03:12:08 Thats what we love about you @TimHammond1 you think outside the box

LOL  

nothing worse than kids crying because they burned their tongue or lips with hot oil.
8007 2018-02-05 03:11:39 Oil companies don't have to file right away and there isn't a statute of limitations. They can play the ISDS cards later. That's the point and the problem with oil sands expansion. We will be left holding the bag on industry failure and cleanup.
8008 2018-02-05 03:11:22 Everyone were climbing the poles at Main Street they didn’t oil those
8009 2018-02-05 03:11:20 Life tip: drink water and use coconut oil
8010 2018-02-05 03:11:18 All the poles are covered in motor oil too
8011 2018-02-05 03:11:15 
8012 2018-02-05 03:11:14 Yeah and the reason for that was a huge glut of oil. Bitcoin has a limited supply. Oil doesn’t
8013 2018-02-05 03:11:02 Pure evil bastards right there! Makes me sick! Killed our people, our military for what? Oil? Opium? Homeland security so He can spy on us?
8014 2018-02-05 03:10:56 Olive oil rosemary salt pepper. They went in a freekeh grain salad
8015 2018-02-05 03:10:45 So basically today at work my manager kept telling me that women are useless and pathetic and I finally got tired of it and in front of customers I very loudly told him that if he didn’t shut the fuck up I was going to throw the hot oil from the fryer on him.
8016 2018-02-05 03:10:44 エルザに殴られたなう
8017 2018-02-05 03:10:37 So when I predicted that every drop of oil in the ground will one day be burned then I am endorsing that? Ok psycho hypocrite.  I couldn't have been any clearer. That oil will be shipped. Let's ship it safely.
8018 2018-02-05 03:10:35 Obama had syria and libya on his deal, that is a 40 year proxy war that all those men in the picture were in on. Carter started the whole oil fiasco.
8019 2018-02-05 03:10:33 nasobrahan ako ng lagay ng sunflower oil sa buhok ko. lol. nagmamantika tuloy.
8020 2018-02-05 03:10:28 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
8021 2018-02-05 03:10:22 They start making a terrible stir fry and LEAVE THE OIL ON THE STOVE WHILE BANGING BUT DON'T DIE IN A FIRE I mean what kind of realism is that.
8022 2018-02-05 03:10:20 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
8023 2018-02-05 03:10:17 #oott #wti If indices continue to plunge, expect Oil to follow suit.

8025 2018-02-05 03:10:10 those drills can mine oil tbh
8026 2018-02-05 03:10:02 there have been two commercials from large beer corporations focused on water, if you don’t think water is the new oil you sleepin’ son
8027 2018-02-05 03:09:46 Their about to run out of Motor Oil in Philadelphia
8028 2018-02-05 03:09:38 Hot oil has gotten on my glasses...!
8029 2018-02-05 03:09:31 How about slicker'n than the oil he uses on his hair.
8030 2018-02-05 03:09:28 Coconut oil is a really nice moisturizer, but if you can't stand the oiliness of it get jergens lotion at Wal-Mart.
8031 2018-02-05 03:09:28 Did I say shutting? I said stop letting them expand 20-50+ year projects. What do you think is going to happen to the tailings as oil use declined sharply in 20 years? Who do you think will pay to clean that up? But yeah let's let the industry keep making a bigger mess.
8032 2018-02-05 03:09:24 The Pats need a Brazilian IndyCar driver, that block would have been made.
8033 2018-02-05 03:09:19 <<if I lived in Philly, no sleep tonight, fuck around and house catch on fire #SuperBowl They put hydraulic oil on poles instead of Crisco today, wonder if it's flammable
8034 2018-02-05 03:09:18 I wonder if anybody consulted with the EPA on this idea. I would think intentionally creating an oil spill is just a little bit illegal.
8035 2018-02-05 03:09:15 That Jeep ad. Running a car through a pristine creek and waterfall. Throw in some fuel, oil or other fluids. Perfect.
8036 2018-02-05 03:09:12 and here it comes
8037 2018-02-05 03:09:07 หุ่นโดนใจ
8038 2018-02-05 03:09:05 I need me some pain be gone oil
8039 2018-02-05 03:09:03 I’m really mad because if the Eagles lose Will has to buy me a new bottle of Jamaican black castor oil! Shits expensive for a little bottle!! patriots don’t let me down
8040 2018-02-05 03:08:54 Motor oil on the poles in Philly is looking more and more like a good idea!
8041 2018-02-05 03:08:48 Same with Palm Oil lovin' PepsiCo!

#BoycottPepsiCo
#PalmOil
#LeuserEcosystem
8042 2018-02-05 03:08:41 I mean, they get to oil me down and that’s pretty awesome TBH
8043 2018-02-05 03:08:36 Yup....dont let the GOAT get another chance.
8044 2018-02-05 03:08:30 They're using gear oil this time (really)
8045 2018-02-05 03:08:17 I hope that oil they put on the lamp posts isn’t too flammable because there’s a chance Philadelphia burns to the ground tonight #DoesCriscoBurn?
8046 2018-02-05 03:08:12 Peak oil is also a lie.  Come on man.
8047 2018-02-05 03:08:08 You know they coated the light poles with motor oil this time? 
8048 2018-02-05 03:08:04 I hope that oil grease on the light poles wore off in PHILLY
8049 2018-02-05 03:08:03 They covered the light poles with motor oil. Not one will make it to tomorrow
8050 2018-02-05 03:08:01 is hydraulic oil flammable?
8051 2018-02-05 03:07:59 Let's see if the motor oil keeps the philly fans off the poles tonight
8052 2018-02-05 03:07:56 I hear it is best to use some sort of oil like baby oil because oils don't contain much dissolved oxygen like water does. That forces the bug out faster.
8053 2018-02-05 03:07:50 WOW! Grease those poles in Philly!! Where’s @Lucas_Oil when the city needs them!?  Come On, Forrest... get a shipment there STAT!! #SuperBowl #SB52
8054 2018-02-05 03:07:30 They failed with the Crisco on poles so now they are using crank case oil 
8055 2018-02-05 03:07:23 joe was farting up our room so badly i was yelling I CAN’T LIVE LIKE THIS and he was running around getting the oil diffuser saying YOU ALREADY SAID YOU WOULD MARRY ME !!! IT’S LEGAL !!!! 
8056 2018-02-05 03:07:19 They certainly do. If Pats manage to get the ball back...
8057 2018-02-05 03:07:19 めっちゃ時間かかったわアローラハゲ
8058 2018-02-05 03:07:03 Olive oil, salt, pepper?
8059 2018-02-05 03:07:01 Philadelphia gonna light the motor oil they put on all those light poles on fire.
8060 2018-02-05 03:06:58 hydraulic oil tonight
8061 2018-02-05 03:06:57 Philly fans are already drinking riot punch, they’re going to be sweating paint thinner. Hydraulic oil is no match for that
8062 2018-02-05 03:06:52 Eagles need to win this for Phil Besser.. 99yrs old and never missed a Philly game. He NEEDS to see this.

8069 2018-02-05 03:06:22 Although, if you tell a doTerra person that melaleuca is the same dang thing as the tea tree oil you can buy for cheap at Trader Joe's or wherever, sometimes you can get a light bulb to go off in their head.
8070 2018-02-05 03:06:21 With all of the motor oil they put on the poles in Philly, it very well could.
8071 2018-02-05 03:06:19 Alaskans own 429,302 shares of NATIONAL OILWELL VARCO INC, worth $17,210,717. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in UNITED STATES.

8074 2018-02-05 03:05:40 I agree...but they still need a first down.
8075 2018-02-05 03:05:35 To be honest, I'm admittedly minus the eucalyptus and the SIS. But: I'm in admiration of your life choices and I do, however, have rose oil diffusing as I read THE HELP and pet my cat. So it's the same.
8076 2018-02-05 03:05:28 Every year @Pepsi buys half a million metric tons of palm oil to make products like Doritos, Cheetos, Quaker Granola Bars, & Lay’s potato chips.
The reality of what happens on palm plantations is very different to Pepsi’s fun, glamorous, green-washing #superbowl ad campaigns ...
8077 2018-02-05 03:05:27 Hydraulic oil this time
8078 2018-02-05 03:05:05 Coconut oil >>>>> Olive oil, rice bran oil, sunflower oil, all other so called 'healthy' oils.

8079 2018-02-05 03:04:41 They used motor oil
8080 2018-02-05 03:04:32 @joerogan I listened to your podcast with @bengreenfield & I heard him mention Thieves essential oil. I’d love to send you a bottle & some info! It’s amazing for immune support!

8088 2018-02-05 03:03:33 هذا الكلام بعد ما يغير حقيقة ان ابن سعود كان عميل لبريطانيا و بعد الحرب العالمية الثانية صار عميل لامريكا. ههههههه ابن سعود نزل عند جزمة المندوب البريطاني وقت تقسيم الحدود .  الزبدة الناس عندها اسباب لمعارضة النظام الدكتاتوري مو لمجرد انهم عملاء مثل ما يدعي ال سعود
8089 2018-02-05 03:03:19 In 1918 - The oil well No. 1 Chaney began producing in Breckenridge, TX. This event started a boom that swelled the population from 800 to
8090 2018-02-05 03:03:15 Do you use oil now?
8091 2018-02-05 03:03:14 These announcers giving Brady a hot coconut oil massage after this game lol. Collinsworth is truly ignorant.
8092 2018-02-05 03:03:01 Tom Brady just drank 900 gallons of water and sprayed some Thieves Oil on his arm, there’s no stopping him.
8093 2018-02-05 03:02:52 Wanted to up my skincare game this year, so I went to ross and spent $20 on a cleansing oil, a serum, and a hair mask. We’ll see how this goes 
8094 2018-02-05 03:02:49 What is wrong with yellow poster?  He/she/it was dropped on the head one too many times as an infant.

* Did a TV commercial promoting "clean coal"
* Opened up deepwater oil drilling, even after the BP disaster.

8099 2018-02-05 03:02:24 I just priced out a 5 gram (dry flower) prescription equiv. of CBD oil (~1000mg of CBD a day equiv.) to fill that script for a year would cost $80,300 plus tax.

$220 a gram for CBD basically. How much is it in Boston for CBD?

8104 2018-02-05 03:01:21 Eliminate all oil, including in cooking. Liquid sauté using vegetable broth instead. This will reduce your calories by about 1/3 and will make a huge difference. There will be new recipes on my site describing this technique in this coming week. Good luck!

8109 2018-02-05 03:01:01 The oil industry needs to die, letting it grow is going to put us in the position of eventually having to kill it directly. Hell even the coal phase out had the government handing money to coal companies. Letting them expand when we don't need to is stupid.

8236 2018-02-05 02:38:20 Chelsea, Joey apparently hasn’t any class, humor, nor does he have a good eye for beauty and from what I can see, he’s not exactly an oil painting.
8237 2018-02-05 02:38:17 A significant portion of the NEB analysis and resulting final report on TMX dealt with the marine transport of oil, including the response and other mitigation measures that would be in place to deal with any spill.
8238 2018-02-05 02:38:12 That last drive by NE was unstoppable. This very well go down to the last play.

8240 2018-02-05 02:38:03 They are doing poorly. They relied on oil exports at high $. When the price tumbled they suffered. But how many $ do WE HAVE to print daily?
8241 2018-02-05 02:37:50 Thanks @weathernetwork , we need all the education we can get. How about a primer between the difference between bitumen and conventional oil - and how we don't know how to deal with a spill of the former?
8242 2018-02-05 02:37:45 Like it or not...there is good reason for it.

8281 2018-02-05 02:30:56 My almost 3 year old and I were making brownies. I let him crack the eggs, add the oil and scrape the bowl kinda stuff. I preheated oven to 350 and put brownies in for 30 minutes. 17 minutes in, brownies are burning. He turned the dial on the oven to 510 degrees

8384 2018-02-05 02:15:33 It was a sirloin cut but a smaller cut. And yeah... So I didn't brown the surface super hot and out in oven, I just cooked it in stove top. The directions said cook it when the pan is super hot, for 8 to 10 mins. Don't use oil. Use butter half way through
8385 2018-02-05 02:15:23 if you guys have never eaten fried banana before then i def recommend you do it's very good
-cut banana n half vertically
-use lots of cooking oil
-make sure the fire is high and the oil hot 
-cook it by eye, once you turn it and both sides are a dark yellow it's good
8386 2018-02-05 02:15:15 Only exfoliate once a week, drink pleanty of water, if you use makeup make sure you legit take it off before actually washing your face, ice it. And if it isn’t gone by the weekend, either green concealer or peach. Straight tea tree oil can work too

8388 2018-02-05 02:14:53 Putin Won?
America is net exporter of oil & natural gas. Now in competition with Russia.
Military funding is increased which makes NATO 
stronger
And I'm sure Putin is just loving an America with a strong economy
8389 2018-02-05 02:14:36 Pour me some oil! Please.  Erin too. lol
8390 2018-02-05 02:14:28 Let’s see, I think I want to aim for elbow length hair. I’ll see if this castor oil is about something.

8392 2018-02-05 02:14:07 Burning oil wells is dumb. But really not that bad for environment compared to other natural events like Mt St Hellen’s

Look at my twitter history, I am an environmental Do'er! Are you?
8399 2018-02-05 02:12:52 Thank You Australia.  Can you have Midnight Oil do a video to watch as a short before the movie.  That would be legend. G'day.
8400 2018-02-05 02:12:51 No, just pick up a 6-pack at your local liquor store!

8423 2018-02-05 02:09:52 Right?! Maybe shale oil boom employees that are from New England?

8428 2018-02-05 02:09:02 It would. Alberta can’t get its oil out. So we sell to the USA at a big discount. They have facilities to move the oil out. If we were are part of them they would appreciate us.

8433 2018-02-05 02:08:04 Airlines better not raise prices now that oil is getting more expensive because they sure as hell didn’t lower their ticket prices when oil was cheap.

Learned my lesson.
8441 2018-02-05 02:06:24 Oil reserves in the country were discovered in 1934. Kuwait’s oil reserves are the world’s sixth largest. #Hist125009 I’m tweeting about kuwait because feb is the month we celebrate our national and liberation day 
8442 2018-02-05 02:05:55 Yes, but is a high erucic oil that much better for bio fuel?

Or is it a market price point?  Fuel vs food?
8443 2018-02-05 02:05:51 tight @SuperBowl ...won’t be picking out my clothes til morning...so expect me to look like @jtimberlake tomorrow ...in other words, like i’ve been doing oil changes all day...

8450 2018-02-05 02:03:44 Wrong! Peak Oil is a hoax. But that doesn't mean I believe in polluting. Just that you have demonstrated that you believe in 2 pseudo-science hoaxes.
8451 2018-02-05 02:03:42 There's no such thing as gas shortage man, its all set up by the government, everything's controlled by the oil companies like I heard about this guy who invented a car that runs on water man, its fiber glass, air cooled and it runs on water!

8466 2018-02-05 02:01:22 The people behind 9/11 were unquestionably terrorists. I think you’re getting the wars mixed up. The Afghanistan war was in retaliation for 9/11. The Iraqi war was said to be because of WMD but it was really for oil. In the end, there was no evidence of WMD or 9/11 connections

8476 2018-02-05 01:59:27 I got my Monat hair products in today & I was telling Landon about how excited I was to wash my hair.

8480 2018-02-05 01:57:51 i wonder if it was simple as oil leaking?  not enough lubricant will ultimately cause the engine to blow up.   that fire was so big, I thought you were joking and posted some movie still or something. yikes
8481 2018-02-05 01:57:35 My stupid car leaked all its oil overnight. Now I might have to replace my oil pan.  I have the worst luck with cars. #fml

8487 2018-02-05 01:56:33 I coated my cat Pepe le poop with argon oil. I can’t believe how soft he is now.
8488 2018-02-05 01:55:48 And what would happen if the Americans say to us nope we don't want your oil anymore? CANADA years ago should of been selling our resources to China, Japan etc, we have to get off not being so reliable on the states, look at how nutty they are now
8489 2018-02-05 01:55:33 You are aware the US has had oil spills, right?  It’s not like it’s hypothetical paranoia like “chem trails”.  It actually has happened.
8490 2018-02-05 01:55:18 If I have an essential oil class to educate people on their benefits and give them the opportunity to buy some, who all in the Spokane area would be interested?

8497 2018-02-05 01:53:27 Somehow MLK selling me a Ram truck is much more offensive than Olive Oil dancing with a Coke.

8502 2018-02-05 01:52:51 Kinder Morgan could increase employment cleaning up after oil   spills.
8503 2018-02-05 01:52:38 Okay I really want to get an oil diffuser but I don’t wanna make a dumb decision and hurt my cats
8504 2018-02-05 01:51:54 YES! The olive oil and sea salt is what I get 
8505 2018-02-05 01:51:42 Western Canada used to be tropical, that is how all the oil got there.  Ontario was covered in ice a mile thick 10,000 years ago but not now.  Things change.  The world will keep spinning long after we're all gone.  Don't mess with my lifestyle, let the 3rd world clean up first.

Like you said....too much rubbish and junk science and half truths.
8519 2018-02-05 01:47:36 Fun fact: In order to correctly portray Mark David Chapman (the guy who killed John Lennon) Jared Leto gained 70 pounds by eating microwaved ice cream with olive oil and soy sauce every day. That’s the most disgusting thing I’ve ever heard.

8523 2018-02-05 01:47:19 Like the 4 biggest banks own the 4 biggest oil companies, or...
8524 2018-02-05 01:46:54 I'm grudgingly cleaning because I want to stress-bake (olive oil sea salt lemon bars!)
8525 2018-02-05 01:46:13 Online marketers can be so self-important. The fact is, for all the counting of clicks, and retweets, and "engagement," online stats are just a bunch of snake oil designed to woo ignorant clients into thinking its helping more than a billboard or postcard. Truth is nobody knows.
8526 2018-02-05 01:46:05 Anything green is good. Even if covered in oil and cheese
8527 2018-02-05 01:46:04 Aberdeen isn't cheap because it's full of rich business people scouting for oil..
8528 2018-02-05 01:45:52 Pure tea tree oil on keloids.

That’s all I got. Thank me later.
8529 2018-02-05 01:45:41 They gave “Gronk the Machine” a lil oil back in the locker room to get him going
8530 2018-02-05 01:45:30 "And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out." ~Matthew 25:8 #Bible
8531 2018-02-05 01:45:28 When r u going 2 meet w/ppl who care u r ruining our land + ppl against fossil fuels that w/kill us?U took $ frm oil ind while campaigning&now u r their lapdog.We don't want monuments made smaller so your oil friends can ruin more land.Will u ever stop assaulting land,air,water?
8532 2018-02-05 01:45:21 It sounds frightening to someone who is too stupid to understand, actually if you look at Norway, UAE, SA... Etc. Economically nationalized oil countries have done well in the context that corruption is ideally none and it can be handled by the state in a competent manner.
8533 2018-02-05 01:45:18 They have oil, but it's not like here. They are not greedy. They keep the flow of oil money low & steady, year after year.
8534 2018-02-05 01:45:16  Today, data is the new …

8535 2018-02-05 01:45:04 I just wanted to add some oil around his elbows and knees
8536 2018-02-05 01:44:53 leave justin timberlake alone he probably forgot to oil his joints that’s all
8537 2018-02-05 01:44:21 True to form, big brave America considering sanctions on Venezuela's oil, a country that doesn't have two knobs of goat shit to rub together
8538 2018-02-05 01:44:14 They're cuckaloos for getting in the way of development of Canada. We can't even build subways for over 50 years because of these nut jobs. Maybe we should all drive cars and transport our oil by train and trucks instead of subway and pipelines make a lot of sense cuckaloos!
8539 2018-02-05 01:43:58 Half the state is transplants for oil rigs. Maybe there's a lot of them coming from NE?
8540 2018-02-05 01:43:31 Let us pray... “heavenly fatha we ask you to PLEASE bathe this child in all the coconut oil,  black girl magic, & love for her NATURAL BODY as you can fatha GOD... in Jesus’s name AMEN ”
8541 2018-02-05 01:43:24 I'm all about Snake Oil and Ann Bonny.

8546 2018-02-05 01:42:56 Wish somebody had bought a plane ticket to Minneapolis for @BrunoMars. The starter was leaking oil, needed to go to the backup.
8547 2018-02-05 01:42:54 They used Crisco then. This week they used hydraulic oil
8548 2018-02-05 01:42:42 and it does happen on farmland kids & irresponsible adults bottom line using any stream as a road isn't responsible- oil pans are punctured leaks in the stream as well
8549 2018-02-05 01:42:28 Minneapolis got an awesome new stadium. Indianapolis got a brick block. Lincoln Logs but with bricks. Never been a fan of the design of Lucas Oil Stadium.
8550 2018-02-05 01:42:26 They have oil money BUT, their gov. concerned about its citizens, keep oil money at a low & steady flow yr after yr.
8551 2018-02-05 01:41:41 From someone who has ovarian cyst and been suffering from SEVERE period cramps for the past 12 years here are the best 3 things that have helped me from rolling on my bed/floor. 

1) Hot green tea aka not Pokka brand
2) Coke (believe it or not)
3) evening primrose oil
8552 2018-02-05 01:41:39 #Pressurewasher Tips: Always check the oil and gas levels on a gas power washer. Only use unleaded gasoline.

8555 2018-02-05 01:41:13 The poles have been greased with hydraulic oil.
8556 2018-02-05 01:41:00 1 tbsp olive oil. 1 onion, garlic. 1.5 c water, 28 oz can diced tomatoes, bouillon cube, 1/4 tsp dried basil. (Add sugar if toms are tart.) Simmer til onion no longer has crunch, blend, adjust season, serve.
8557 2018-02-05 01:40:57 Oil, sovereign fund and 5 milion people. You can have it all with these three. Even happiness.
8558 2018-02-05 01:40:50 African black soap, organic witch hazel & rose hip seed oil has my skin so soft & dewy these days
8559 2018-02-05 01:40:24 GS was bold and smart in oil forecasting 2 times. When 1) after summer 2015 oil carnage they told that it is not the end yet and market needs capitulation and 2) in january 2016 when they told that possibly oil bear market near finish. other forecasts were B/S
8560 2018-02-05 01:40:23 あ！何かガスマスクつけた白い鳥がいるぞ！待てー！

8563 2018-02-05 01:39:26 thought you were here for that oil platform rig job with those hefty onfeet whatevers
8564 2018-02-05 01:39:16 هذه الألفاظ تعكس مستوى ال سعود و دبابيسهم.  انا مواطن من شبه الجزيرة العربية لي حقوق و سأطالب بها و سأساهم في دعوة شعوب العالم لدعم قضيتنا و فضح انتهاكات ال سعود شأت انت و ولاة امرك الطغاة ام ابيتم. و الفاظك و كذبك و محاولات تشويه الحقائق لن تجدي و لن تنهي المعارضة او تلغي الحقوق
8565 2018-02-05 01:39:13 No...more like roughnecking on an oil rig maybe....but for a whole hell of a lot less money. Now if he wants to include bullets and explosions I'm certain that can be arranged.
8566 2018-02-05 01:38:43 Homemade popcorn with green powder, paprika and avocado oil! While I do my homework and ignore the game as hubby watches :)
8567 2018-02-05 01:38:25 While everyone else watches the Superbowl, I changed oil and rotated tires on all the vehicles.

8574 2018-02-05 01:37:02 Those green accountant visors (that were used to cut the harsh lighting from oil lamps) didn’t necessarily have to be green. They still look great.
8575 2018-02-05 01:37:00 Did you see where they are using Diesel Oil on the poles now, since the Crisco didn't work?  Only in Philly!
8576 2018-02-05 01:36:58 Psalm 23: 5. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 6. Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
8577 2018-02-05 01:36:57 Eagles are playing like a SB team, good for them!
8578 2018-02-05 01:36:51 I saw you cough up a screw and sneeze oil yesterday on video chat. If that doesn't make you a robot, then I don't know what does.
8579 2018-02-05 01:36:36 IN the northeast, the meager gains have been erased by the rapin rise in the cost of gasoline and home heating oil. Thank you Prince TRumplethinskin.
8580 2018-02-05 01:36:35 super exciting things i plan on doing when my taxes come in: haircut! oil change! make a cheap cat tower out of ikea lack tables! bills! bills! bills! (and not in a destiny’s child way)

8656 2018-02-05 01:27:06 Coconut oil... Sticks to surfaces but melts when it starts to warm up. The harder someone tries to pull one down, the slicker it is.
8657 2018-02-05 01:27:05 JT dancing like that robot in the “Filthy” video. Someone need to slide some oil to him.
8658 2018-02-05 01:27:05 #Timberlake clothes look like he's been changing oil in cars all day...what? Oh that's camo pants and a shirt with deer on it? Ok. #SBLII
8659 2018-02-05 01:27:03  RT @IcebergAk: Justin ain’t oil his joints up
8660 2018-02-05 01:26:57 It was intriguing to see the magnitude of oil production and imports in the sankey diagram for Canada in 2015! #sankey #phys273
8661 2018-02-05 01:26:53 Pepsi uses irresponsibly sourced nonrenewable palm oil in their products and Justin Timberlake is a hypocritical chauvinist whose career is built on cultural appropriation. This half time show is making me cringe.
8662 2018-02-05 01:26:49 Why is JT wearing the old towel i use to check my oil
8663 2018-02-05 01:26:39 ไม่ดีอ่ะ กุรู้ตัวหน้าตาไม่ดี ไม่ได้หลงตัวเอง 
8664 2018-02-05 01:26:31 Justin ain’t oil his joints up
8665 2018-02-05 01:26:18 Justin need some oil and a good stretchin 
8666 2018-02-05 01:25:59 David we need pipelines just like we need power lines. No shortage of them; in fact I bet you have one outside your home right now. For now they are required. No oil then all Canadians suffer. No real economic value to windmills. Nat res are only source of real new wealth.

8668 2018-02-05 01:25:49 Your argument was that oil sands needed $80 oil to break even and to prove it you send me a link that says they need $40. Are you sure you may not want to re-consider that first tweet?
8669 2018-02-05 01:25:35 Eh, was he doing an oil change on a tractor this morning?
8670 2018-02-05 01:25:26 Does anyones brain do a thing where you consume a lot of media with a specific style then all your thoughts are in that style for a while? Like if you looked at a lot of oil paintings at a gallery all your characters and thoughts are now also oil paintings in your brain?
8671 2018-02-05 01:24:46 @Jif can you please stop adding palm oil to your products. is it really necessary — i.e. it being worth deforestation and loss of biodiversity? it makes me feel like a worthless human being. i just want to be a choosy mom who chooses Jif (ethically). all my love

8683 2018-02-05 01:22:04 Other than perhaps some extra drought tolerance, Id be interested to know why mustard vs canola.  Canola oil per acre wud be much higher than mustard oil per acre. Maybe some other property??

8690 2018-02-05 01:21:21 Trying to confuse Glendale's need for reliable energy with GWP's need to build a $500 million dirty power plant is pretty sad. Glendale wants clean energy and clean air not the giant plant your oil company advisors are recommending. We need an independent review of alternatives.

8802 2018-02-05 01:03:55 I was warming up some Goya octopus and it exploded all over the microwave... now there's oil everywhere and it smells. 
8803 2018-02-05 01:03:36 $400 in wine and $200 in olive oil. Worth it.
8804 2018-02-05 01:03:18 @VP The U.S. is exporting more Oil than ever before, there is no excuse for their continuing raising the price of gasoline.
Repealing these nine tax breaks would, at minimum, save the U.S. Treasury $37.7 billion over 10 years.

8809 2018-02-05 01:01:22 I guess toxic masculinity, manspreading and armrest stealing smells of overwhelming Drakar Noir tonight.  This plane is too small for that amount of cologne.  I’m about to break out 3oz of holy oil for myself.
8810 2018-02-05 01:01:12 The Govt you work for approved Kinder Morgan Pipeline which will transport the dirtiest of all fossil fuels to ports in Vancouver. This will cause a 7 fold in tanker traffic and put the coast line at severe risk of destruction. Why? So Alberta can sell its dirty oil for more $

8827 2018-02-05 00:59:17 You would just take a made up substance with no studies to back it up? Cool.

8831 2018-02-05 00:57:23 I guess AB has had enough. It’s hard to negotiate with people who are not doing it in good faith. It’s not pro environment, it’s anti oil sands at all cost. BC is playing with Albertans livelihoods. #landoflaw #notrussia

8856 2018-02-05 00:53:41 I just ate one. This recipe called for less than usual flour.
I was skeptical. Then, I ate one and have no doubt about it.......
they are good. Have a lot of cocoa in them.
Put a couple drops of butter rum oil in them, too.
8857 2018-02-05 00:53:30 The conservatives that got booted deserved it, we got an accidental NDP now @jkenney has an opportunityto fix the problems or be removed as well, oil will be for the foreseeable future our future, one we have new federal and provincial we stand a chance or maybe separation

8859 2018-02-05 00:53:21 Lol, Venezuela's social, political and economic system is completely different from Iran's.  Venezuela produces few commodities outside of oil, while Iran produces what can be considered to be too much food (at the cost of water).
8860 2018-02-05 00:53:21 The balls on extra points and field goals must have motor oil on them
8861 2018-02-05 00:53:13 Maybe we will try this. My fave standby is old fashioned coconut oil. Cheap, long lasting, effective, and tasteless

8887 2018-02-05 00:48:39 Important from @WorldAnimalNews: the Trump admin announced it is opening nearly all U.S. federal waters to offshore drilling activities. It is a five-year program planning to expand future oil & gas leasing to the Atlantic, Pacific & Arctic oceans & eastern Gulf of Mexico

8892 2018-02-05 00:47:42 In situations like this a bit of 'work' on the hole can help. Try backing the screws out and back in which can free it up some. I'm assuming it's real wood and not composite? A little bit of oil can help however it can stain the area around the screw head if there's excess.

8894 2018-02-05 00:47:35 low oil prices were a problem because they could never get agriculture to work. But yeah, it was grim.

Still, the post-Soviet years have been fucked up beyond belief, and by the West. We made mistakes out of greed and ideological idiocy which were obvious even at the time.

8899 2018-02-05 00:47:06 no, you don't ... if you did you would be FAR more upset about the subsidies given to oil and gas companies then the measly subsidies given to the EV  industry of which Tesla is only one small part ... you sir are a liar and a fraud
8900 2018-02-05 00:47:04 Defense Contractors, Big Pharma, Big Oil --- I can see, without much effort at all, that our problem is *not* 'Big Government'. That's only the bogey-man used to distract us from the oligarchic plutocracy currently in charge..!
8901 2018-02-05 00:46:31 it’s one use only! IMO they take slightly longer than normal moist makeup wipes BUT then after you basically don’t have to do anything else  no oil or residue after. i just put a little eye cream and moisturizer on
8902 2018-02-05 00:46:26 I don’t think that will work.  Lemon oil comes from the rind so I can’t guarantee that.

8938 2018-02-05 00:40:57 If the impact of this move ($$) is as great as OUR environmental groups believe, the rest of the world will be impacted too. They should also be challenging this tragic decision. Maybe this was his goal all along: to get Putin's oil interests in places it has no business going.

9001 2018-02-05 00:30:13 Someone on tv was saying it's hydraulic fluid but everything else I've heard was motor oil so I'm not sure
9002 2018-02-05 00:30:12 Yeah I don’t mind paying for decent quality beef, but great toppings don’t have to be expensive. Fancy aïolis, caramelized onions, pâtés,these are all very inexpensive to make. Keep the truffle, the god awful truffle oil, the gold leaf for people who don’t know any better.

9005 2018-02-05 00:29:53 What better place than to drill off our west coast, lots of illegals to help work the oil rigs, makes sense
9006 2018-02-05 00:29:46 That's only for your scalp. Not much on the hair. Use extra virgin coconut oil. Like soak your hair in it and then wash.
9007 2018-02-05 00:29:23 Ive noticed it’s less dry when you exfoliate and put a lil Vaseline before hand. And baby oil (any oil really) helps with removal!

9039 2018-02-05 00:25:02 Okay, quick bread makers, I have a question. For a recipe that calls for 2/3 cup oil, I used butter instead, because I like the butter flavor better. BUUUUT...it's almost too buttery. What would you do in that case? 1/3 cup oil, 1/3 cup butter? Something else?
9040 2018-02-05 00:24:51 No gas glut @Shell? Macquarie released a report late last year saying the pricing slope for long term contracts had fallen from 14% of oil price to 11%
If there was no glut the gas price would be steady not falling some 20%
Hence everthing they say is Bull #auspol #natgas #LNG

9082 2018-02-05 00:14:29 Thatcher bankrolled her society-wide experiments with Neo-Liberalism with Scottish oil. Meanwhile, in Norway, every child born is a Millionaire thanks to the prudent governance of oil wealth!
9083 2018-02-05 00:14:24 It’s not the fact that it’s “socialism”, in quotes because it’s a dictator-run country, but because they failed to diversify their economy beyond oil.

9095 2018-02-05 00:12:20 @Gus_ODonnell Impartial my backside. You and your cronies are the snake oil salesmen. Do one!
9096 2018-02-05 00:12:11 You think I can't change things because I was born in a basket of canola oil and anime?
9097 2018-02-05 00:12:08 I have an oily t zone so I hate foundations that make me oil up. Thanks though xx
9098 2018-02-05 00:11:55 all that deep fried  ...oil heated up like that is pretty much toxic
9099 2018-02-05 00:11:52 Does your family know you a hateful old man with nothing better to do then ridicule a mother? Now I understand where the statement "nasty old men" came from.. early definition of you! Hey isn't it time for you to soak your dentures and turn on the oil lamps?
9100 2018-02-05 00:11:29 Me on Saturday: oki starting Monday I'm eating clean cutting oil n sugar for a week

9101 2018-02-05 00:11:27 Sure will be nice for all the oil workers when they come up and drill in our Refuge.  Not going to forget this.

9105 2018-02-05 00:10:12 He lived in quite a remote area (I don’t live too far from there). Weather has been incredibly cold and blizzard filled. Not sure if that’s related to his disappearance. It’s also oil country and there have been a lot of people losing their homes due to being laid off for so long
9106 2018-02-05 00:09:53 "We simply cannot allow to stand idly by to see the total destruction of democracy in Venezuela", Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said today in Argentina, where also mentioned considering restricting imports of Venezuelan oil. #venezuela #maduro
9107 2018-02-05 00:09:49 but also boss lady got me some actual octopus last night hh it was. so good w just a lil salt and olive oil
9108 2018-02-05 00:09:47 I keep spilling olive oil while cooking because I’m twerking to Hall & Oates’ “Out of Touch”.
9109 2018-02-05 00:09:24 When the Cowboys played the Steelers in Supe 13, we had some friends over, including a couple who brought their deep fryer, lots of oil, small bits of chicken and a special concoction sauce. Oh, and they were from Buffalo, NY. #SuperBowlFoodMemories
9110 2018-02-05 00:09:17 Increasing oil productivity is probably going to cause another recession this year
9111 2018-02-05 00:09:06 Will do ~ always trying to keep everyone gut heathy with probiotics and oregano oil
9112 2018-02-05 00:08:58 Vegetable Oil headted to 375 Degrees 

Wonton wraps
Seitan mixed with black pepper, garlic
Chopped Green Onions
Finely dice jalapeno 

When oil is at temp, dip them in one/two at a time to maintain temperature. Let fry to golden brown (less than a minute) 
Remove and let cool!
9113 2018-02-05 00:08:23 Just rub cooking oil or baby oil over the tape, wait five minutes, and then pull the skin away from the tape instead of the tape away from the skin.
9114 2018-02-05 00:08:15 What exactly do you mean by sustainable palm oil? RSPO has been riddled with fraud and industry collusion. Most "sustainable #palmoil" is about as #sustainable as "clean coal" is clean. Even so, 16-30% "sustainably sourced" is not very much. Do better, @PepsiCo!

9117 2018-02-05 00:07:29 Not sure how you get excited about watching such a boring game. Don’t get me started on why it’s called football #BBCNFL
9118 2018-02-05 00:07:02 There are a heck of a lot more than 112 components found in Cannabis, I think you mean cannabinoids (and it's 113 known now).

The point is, the CURRENT oils don't even list 95% of those cannabinoids.
Sure more research is needed, but CBD oil is going to drop like a rock meantime
9119 2018-02-05 00:06:51 Pickle oil?
9120 2018-02-05 00:06:30 ...building to save a civilian? How about shooting a 50 cal. from a helo at folks in black pjs killing them & not knowing if it was the ones who saved yr life or the enemy and for what? Oil it was rumored.
9121 2018-02-05 00:06:24 The "oil king" hates them alternative energies too. Count it.
9122 2018-02-05 00:06:06 a cookie I ate earlier reminded me of cooked fish eyes with scallion oil, and now the water I'm drinking reminds me of it :/ Since I can't get the thought of the flavor out of my head.... but it is a tasty flavor, just not with my current items
9123 2018-02-05 00:05:58 ~he loved his man. Reaching into the box, he takes a bottle of lavender scented oil and hands it to the other male. “Let’s start in a very traditional way..” he murmurs glancing at the box, a hint of smile playing on his lips. Oh he has plenty of ideas for tonight and considering
9124 2018-02-05 00:05:43 Even I use their Black Castor Oil shampoo!! Hahaha
9125 2018-02-05 00:05:26 Almost there. The broom needed oil.
9126 2018-02-05 00:05:19 I am laying out the evidence you are responding with words not fact. I so mixed in my tricks I want what's best for you and yours. I want more money in your pocket and show you how too. You say we need oil and pollution too. I can't argue if you ignore fact and provide fiction.
9127 2018-02-05 00:05:11 I did my first face mask for this decade and it stripped all the oil off my skin and my skin hasn't felt this bad in YEARS.
Excuse me as I never follow beauty recommendations ever again.

9131 2018-02-05 00:04:19 Yup 150+ for a oil change and a car that look cool, but they’re all reasonable fast compared to your stock muscles and mild street cars
9132 2018-02-05 00:04:13 Ok and seen that it on nonessential [/not/ oil/gas, food, labor, construction material, healthcare]; Just not a big fan of it, it regressive ultimately ... could be worse tho I guess
9133 2018-02-05 00:04:06 I just knocked over an entire bottle of Eucalyptus Oil onto my bedroom floor. There's no way to get rid of the scent, so now I'm just going with it and playing Enya. #leanin

A March 2010 Greenpeace report shows that Koch Industry foundations have contributed (2005-2008) nearly $25 million to organizations that oppose clean energy and climate policy. That does not include oil and gas lobbying of $37.9 million.

9150 2018-02-05 00:02:29 I use organic CBD oil from Kentucky Hemp Works. It is legal and I was able to get off of Fentanyl patches. No high. Just less nerve pain. I am still on seizure meds and as-needed narcotics. We are armed to the teeth but it's safer not to have patches in the house.
9151 2018-02-05 00:02:04 That’s just historical analysis? That’s not incorrect oil isn’t intrinsically evil lol?
9152 2018-02-05 00:02:02 Every time I get an oil change I feel like Im in a brand new car mane
9153 2018-02-05 00:01:52 How do you know if less oil is better maybe if less oil means more products to block your pores so lets ask a dermatologist to do their research instead about this not just paper and drops .. just saying
9154 2018-02-05 00:01:46 Just a drop or two, I’ve had my travel size oil for a year now
9155 2018-02-05 00:01:37 The most common thing I say at restaurants: "no, that's okay, mayonnaise doesn't have dairy in it - it's just eggs and oil"
9156 2018-02-05 00:01:36 About 80% of the “Italian” olive oil on the market right now isn’t Italian and isn’t olive oil. California has some of the strictest olive oil standards in the world right now. Areas in CA suited for red wine are also perfect for olive oil. #dontdependonforeignoil

9168 2018-02-05 00:00:02 Olive, jojoba, and sweet almond oils are all wonderful elixirs for hair. If your hair is thick and heavy, coconut oil works wonders.
