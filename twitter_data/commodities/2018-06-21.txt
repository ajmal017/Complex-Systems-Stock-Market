37 2018-06-21 22:33:26 A bit of advice since I’m sure you’ve never done any real farm work in your life. Farmers don’t want subsidies. They want strong prices on their commodities which you devastated with your ridiculous tariff war. #AreWeGreatYet
38 2018-06-21 22:32:19 Some of these CRAZY PPLE! This COUNTRY HAS A HISTORY OF TAKING OUR BABIES AWAY FROM US AND TREATING US AS COMMODITIES! #GiveTHEMBACK #JusticeorElse
39 2018-06-21 22:31:07 Like. That's the point of revolutionary action. The way we live probably won't be just like it is now. We'll probably have less ridiculous commodities and choices among those commodities. 

But that's okay. Because we want to be free. That's the goal.

44 2018-06-21 22:05:00 Women will be seen as commodities with or without strip clubs. And if a woman CHOOSES to do this with her body she should have that right.
45 2018-06-21 21:48:15 Why would they?  The US is willingly let them eat our economic lunch.  We run deficits w/them, they take the USD's & buy up real assets (commodities, etc.) w/wildly overvalued USD's.  They'd have to be stupid to proactively stop this gravy train w/biscuit wheels we've given them.
46 2018-06-21 21:45:47 Start moving the energy dinosaurs off the land. Let a new generation innovate and diversify. Give consumers food traceability not facile propaganda. Demand competition in the monopolies. Let farmers risk manage low margin commodities
47 2018-06-21 21:43:25 And what are you @ConsumersKenya doing about it to protect the helpless consumers of those commodities?
48 2018-06-21 21:41:36 All people are valuable Commodities to the infrastructure of America we the collective  work harder than white rich people do ,you know that, that's why you we  love them for our hotels they show up the reliable and they deserve the respect an income they work for.

50 2018-06-21 21:35:24 “Unfortunately, the agriculture industry seems to treat most living beings a mere commodities,” Lauren Ornelas, founder and executive director of the Food Empowerment Project, told Triple Pundit
51 2018-06-21 21:32:03 Except the idea that children are commodities to be sorted, trained & funneled based on corporate needs  IS CRAZY. School is for learning not for low skilled job training and compliance. My kid is NOT human capital for nameless, faceless bureaucrats and their corporate cronies.
52 2018-06-21 21:30:41 This is a common practice by the Canadian CAS. Children are treated as commodities and sexual abuse is rampant within the foster care system.
53 2018-06-21 21:19:25 It’s almost like they have sixth sense on which commodities will be going up in price based on some kind of tariff, crisis, etc.
54 2018-06-21 21:17:00 The #USA is in trouble. #China is securing global resources and #Commodities for the long term future. The U.K. will Be Insignificant without Europe. 
U.K. don’t make anything anymore it’s a service based economy about to collapse post #Brexit
55 2018-06-21 21:15:06 Gold has nothing to do with their monetary base IMO, at least not directly.  It has everything to do with providing a neutral reserve asset to creditors with whom they will inevitably run deficits (oil exporters, certain other commodities).
56 2018-06-21 21:13:15 Women are not commodities 
57 2018-06-21 21:06:52 Later in the day it got clarified that Indian govt has put these additional duties only on USA origin commodities not on all. It was a retaliatory measure taken by Indian govt after USA raised import tariff on import of steel from India.

61 2018-06-21 20:46:53 You do any commodities or only stocks?
62 2018-06-21 20:45:17 Had a lot more to do with it than just that buddy, like Clinton deregulting derivatives with Gramm-Leach-Billy,  and nurturing Glass-Steagle with the Commodities Futures modernization act.
63 2018-06-21 20:42:48 I agree our money should be invested in energy research, in particular, benefiting local commodities as is our driven economy away from conflict cobalt which is mined in the Congo by children to be put into batteries. The worst environmental disaster is child poverty #cdnpoli
64 2018-06-21 20:42:41 Trading commodities perhaps.
65 2018-06-21 20:42:17 Exactly, my dad drove a coal truck in 1960. He made $35 dollars a week. House rent was $20 a month too. If it hasn't been for Government Commodities (food) we would have starved to death even with my dad working full time..
66 2018-06-21 20:37:45 Commodities are fungible goods so I hope they don't mean that. It would mean that all athletes are the same thing, like all gold is the same as other gold with the same value. Commodity is frequently misused in sports. Signed, Economics Nerd
67 2018-06-21 20:28:02 Did he talk about the tariffs that China is putting on Nebraska Pork and other commodities?  Those tariffs will affect Nebraskans very soon. Do he have concerns about the location of the children taken from their parents. Is he going to stand up to Trump?
68 2018-06-21 20:22:24 People do realize there are other people besides farmers that depend on commodities..commodity brokers.  If the farmers cannot grow they have nothing to sell and people cannot buy..

74 2018-06-21 19:48:09 So basically to you ppl are commodities whose labor is based on the exchange value they bring to the market. Everything in capitalism becomes a commodity to be bought and sold. Wow, a really fcked up arrangement.

103 2018-06-21 18:06:40 I agree with that argument, it's what attracted me to commodities. I just worry that they can stay down for a long time.

119 2018-06-21 17:09:45 Far more leverage for tech startups in building product vs building brand.

Many products are commodities and win markets based on brand: beer, energy drinks, etc. 

Commodity d2c can have venture scale returns but shouldn't be confused with traditional tech-driven VC investing.

126 2018-06-21 17:03:30 The NIGGA is one of white supremacy's hottest commodities

128 2018-06-21 17:00:46 I’m grown with all the above you said and more from working in our farm from collecting manures and milking the cow’s even, agriculture is not new to me and more we equally need better roads for the agro commodities to reach its right market.
129 2018-06-21 16:54:38 On Independence Day 15 August 2018 from rampats of Red fort @narendramodi @PMOIndia should proudly declare:

"Am confident Indian #farmers can feed the nation & I annul the Essential Commodities Act"

Most critical reform to revolutionize Indian Agriculture requires no money
130 2018-06-21 16:53:11 my limited understanding is that in many areas, recycling fluctuates with the current market cost of relevant commodities
131 2018-06-21 16:52:46 For immigration and the police, they are a nuisance. For populist politicians, they are commodities. For the US paramilitary authorities, they are assets, and will be fully exploited for as long as possible.
132 2018-06-21 16:43:10 They're also seen as commodities by for-profit detention centers paid handsomely by the U.S. govt.

136 2018-06-21 16:22:05 Because this is sactioned trafficking girls and babies are better commodities

Boys can be made to look threatening just watch Fox and friends call these young boys MS13 its disgusting
137 2018-06-21 16:21:42 Sir how do you predict where is a particular commodity in the cycle? Is it the demand or supply side , debt, capex, working capital cycle, debtors, cash flow or anything else. What's the single most important factor which generally works for most commodities and commodity cos.?
138 2018-06-21 16:21:34 Slightly contradictory call gents - Joe says crude is going up and Keith you've called for a weakness in commodities including crude. How do I read this in the short term given the OPEC meeting tomorrow? Thanks gents. Great work overall. Already making money with your calls.
139 2018-06-21 16:17:01 Africa is the dumping side of usules material and contraband commodities from abroad. Africa being the third continent. Poor in nature should not talorate being manipulated, misleading ,undermine by foreigners. To be rejects of others.
140 2018-06-21 16:13:39 We need to watch Christian non-profit groups on this front: will these children be used as commodities for their work?
141 2018-06-21 16:13:37 For anyone not named Anthony Davis or Kevin Durant with an extension, they should be untouchable. Tatum and Brown are proven commodities that will get better, cheap, and have incredibly high ceilings.
142 2018-06-21 15:54:24 I think the best option is to put immigrant families awaiting hearings into shelters with practical commodities rather than releasing them into the US or locking them in cages.

153 2018-06-21 15:13:27 Granted, the first forms were probably commodities themselves. Food, arrow heads, whatever. Interesting topic but a bit of a tangent here
154 2018-06-21 15:07:48 ... supplying commodities to a large org that does many things is very different from collaborating in an process explicitly. Gauging fundamental ethics is the only way to make decisions under uncertainty. Does my employer still have my basic trust?

157 2018-06-21 14:57:23 Yep and some commodities
158 2018-06-21 14:56:54 Viewing living beings as commodities is inherently abusive.
Placing living creatures in some kind of hierarchy (pet animals vs work animals vs food animals) says you primarily relate to these beings in terms of what they do for you and what you stand to gain from them.
159 2018-06-21 14:54:24 Medicine is run by insurers & government

Physician’s & patients are just the disposable commodities in the machine

Btw what percentage of medical cost go to lawyers?
160 2018-06-21 14:53:32 Between 2006 to 2014 inflation was above 9% your PF WAS earning of 8%. 

Now 2014 8%2015 6%, 2016 onward less than 5%, check govt. data June month of 2017 1.34%. 

The fuel price has no connection with your daily commodities. Only communists fool you.
161 2018-06-21 14:51:16 Yeah, it's pretty easu to do for soybeans, and harder for other commodities
162 2018-06-21 14:47:14 They are bought and sold because they are commodities. As horrible as it sounds, an animal is only worth as much as they can provide to the farmers who own them. I’m afraid that’s just a fact of agriculture. 

If farmers treated each cow like a pet there’d be no profit.
163 2018-06-21 14:45:00 Companies are increasingly relying on #coldchain #logistics to increase the shelf-life of commodities. But a major challenge for cold chain logistics #suppliers lies in improving their supply chain efficiency. Here is what they need to do to get on track:
164 2018-06-21 14:37:05 I didn't realize Scottish babies were taken from their mums around three days old or that people were bought and sold and traded like commodities over there.  How bizarre.
165 2018-06-21 14:32:48 Trump thought of those living breathing human children as nothing but commodities
166 2018-06-21 14:30:31 When prices of commodities like oil go up, policy makers often develop illusions of high growth in exports and GDP, opting to forget the growth in imports. Quantitative data are often ignored. @PMOIndia @FinMinIndia
167 2018-06-21 14:24:22 Your definition of traffickers is skewed. A trafficker is someone who moves goods and commodities for sale. Drug traffickers, arms traffickers. Coyotes are providing people a service that they ask for. Some may/probably do both but to call them all trafficker isnt accurate.

175 2018-06-21 14:06:11 Correct.  Yet if you look at flows, we've been running a trade deficit w/China, & post-3q14, China stopped buying UST's, instead using USD's to buy commodities, etc., leaving us to finance our own capital account.  That doesn't work intermediate term, & we're 4 yrs in.

178 2018-06-21 13:50:49 yes, I had thanks. I ended up down another rabbit hole that discussed inflation, and changing prices of various commodities in 19hC, and decided I had to stick to 1830s as comparator!

180 2018-06-21 13:41:38 Richard Gerstner  @Thetechnician28 I will give a recommendation to buy lightly Nov. Soybeans at 872 a bushel.

181 2018-06-21 13:28:12 No, if commodities go up then stock brokers and people who buy shares of commodities make more money, thus raising the wages for company workers, but this also causes inflation
182 2018-06-21 13:27:26 Examples might include the manufacture of textiles, apparel, footwear, furniture, steel and iron, basic electronics, ecoplastics (an environmental substitute for the plastics and chemical industry), toys and games, energy, and other basic commodities

184 2018-06-21 13:20:52 No one wants it as a job because they make no fucking money, farmers make a lot of money, especially when it comes to commodities, they can easily afford to pay at least $20 and hour for people to help
185 2018-06-21 13:18:26 Doesn’t count as “SN labor” bc SNL is the social labor necessary to produce a commodity ie a thing that enters into exchange relations with all other commodities
186 2018-06-21 13:16:43 Sure, not all labor is equally valuable and the value of work can only be determined when it’s product enters into exchange relations with all the other commodities. If you spend 100 hours making something that no one buys the labor that went into it is worthless and therefore -

206 2018-06-21 12:03:25 You’re equivocating terms here. If we take “commodity” to mean “thing created by capitalist means” as you seem to be, then it’s a tautology that commodities were *not* produced in socialist societies. If we take commodity to mean “thing created by labor,” then of course they
207 2018-06-21 12:01:16 Commodities are a fact of capitalist class relations. Abolishing the capitalist mode of production is necessarily also abolishing the commodity

211 2018-06-21 11:51:26 Nice stuff! It could be explained perhaps in part by the fact that strengthening dollar against yuan means UST selling, whereas strengthening USD also means lower commodities and hence lower yields. Apparently, commodities have a stronger effect on yields.

Not the point you're trying to make , but the thing about commodities is that they're not that difficult to buy. There are many sellers. And no big economy really benefits by generating uncertainty AFTER the stuff is loaded onto tankers.

263 2018-06-21 07:00:11 excuse me but prisons have class character and the products prisoners will make through socialist voluntary forced labor are not commodities because the relations are no longer characterized by wage labor and they're class traitors while the screws are proletarians or something
264 2018-06-21 06:59:37 Are they commodities Bonga?
265 2018-06-21 06:59:28 Excellent talk!
Yes we *are* being farmed as commodities.
It is pervasive---whether it be the pharmaceutical industry or construction industry(as in Grenfell)etc.
Are these groups working together?
Sometimes-- but not necessarily always.
Their mindset is always the same though!
266 2018-06-21 06:55:18 Regardless Im tired of them making people commodities. Social growth is important economic growth only favours a few

271 2018-06-21 06:31:04 Despite being over 100 years old, no one has disrupted Cargills business model and global soft commodities trade is about $1T. What gives?
272 2018-06-21 06:27:49 It's because you are ignorant dat was why you believe a dollar can be come one naira forthnight.before u can enhance your local currency you must be a productive nation.Nigeria depends mostly on foreign commodities.we import rice,milk,tomato even toothpicks
273 2018-06-21 06:22:55 In 1939 a boat left Germany carrying 900 Jewish refugees. NY refused them entry. It is estimated that 1/3 would subsequently die in camps. That is what happens when fear of ‘the other’ replaces empathy, people become commodities, an inconvenience.
274 2018-06-21 06:21:31 He said he would date Ivanka if she wasn't her daughter, but this is a man who speaks of women with nothing but contempt. He sees them as nothing but objects, as commodities, just like everyone else. She's no different. He won't hesitate to throw her over if she gets in his way.
275 2018-06-21 06:08:32 War is the systematic murder of the poor who are treated like disposable commodities by the ruling elites.

277 2018-06-21 05:55:32 Have you been registering a child at one school under one name and registering the same child at another school under another name? Are you claiming a free education twice? Are you using children as commodities?
278 2018-06-21 05:52:37 Brilliant madam.......yoga and religion should not become commodities, if they are made one, they become weapons of destruction rather than adding value to a civilization......

285 2018-06-21 05:19:34 no you idiot it's racism to put someone on a pedestal and treat them like they're commodities based on their race, do you any reading comprehension whatsoever?
286 2018-06-21 05:11:37 They don’t seem to understand that the “end of work” doesn’t mean we don’t have to ‘work’ to make the things we need to survive but changing the concept of work from that of mass production of commodities to something fulfilling and joyful

294 2018-06-21 04:04:59 We must defuse quantum-polarization of American politics.

297 2018-06-21 03:46:54 Solo had a bunch of people that were not proven commodities in lead roles (Except Woody Harrelson, who alone is probably not a huge draw himself), and it recast a role that had probably the most popular film actor of all time. Not a great look.
298 2018-06-21 03:39:47 It’s always about the money. These poor kids are just commodities to these evil people. They’re all grifters. Just look at what Scott Pruitt has done at the EPA, and he’s still there.
299 2018-06-21 03:30:23 But increased price of petrol diesel and all essential commodities now become curse for Indian. First care India then teach yoga to world.

312 2018-06-21 02:12:57 I often say this; essentially crypto will have a few coins be treated like commodities and trade as standard forex/metals for the most part while others will make up the exciting new penny stock market of digital assets/securities. $BTC $XMR = $XAU $POLY $IHT = $EGY et cetera
313 2018-06-21 02:04:28 You can build a case that this is what Xi's rebalancing would look like: credit is tightening but weak SOEs have been rolled into strong ones. But the necessary precursor was strong metals/commodities prices.

319 2018-06-21 01:43:00 Trade in commodities is the oldest honourable livelihood in humans. There will be natural attraction for those who honoured this practice as divine by openly setting the auction process and pricing mechanism through mehr.
320 2018-06-21 01:39:37 As a matter of interest do these levies apply to added value products such as yogurts, probiotics etc? Surely NZ Inc should be fighting tariffs on added value products not the basic commodities?
321 2018-06-21 01:34:20 ICE was a for profit, creation of the Bush/Cheney cabal with the cooperation of most Dems where human beings were used as commodities by the Private Contractors such as the Private Prison Ind. A racist org from day one that never shld have existed
322 2018-06-21 01:29:00 The only place these kids are going to be reunited is in one of Ivanka’s sweatshops. To the Trumps, these kids are commodities, not human beings.
