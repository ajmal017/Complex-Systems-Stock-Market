38 2018-08-20 22:02:14 there is defo pressure but it stems from capitalism and exploitation: lust, love, romance are commodities, so sex and real physical desire are packaged, branded goods and the idea to consume rather than experience sex is sold to us via mainstream media.

60 2018-08-20 19:52:57 Risk sentiment remained moderately positive, the S&P500 up 0.3%, major commodities higher, and USD lower.

62 2018-08-20 19:27:54 How can we revamp our manufacturing capacity, we can target specific goods that can be easily made in Zambia locally and ban imports on such goods from outside, an other way is to invite those companies that make such commodities to make them from here, I know it's not easy.

73 2018-08-20 18:27:38 Winning coaches are rare commodities and we defend them because we inherently know this. It’s no different from people who defended kings and queens  in the Middle Ages who were morally reprehensible but ruled well. People died for a monarch who saw them as property.
74 2018-08-20 18:23:15 Since most commodities will spend 90% of their time inversely correlated to the Dollar and since the Dollar itself is often a haven and will rise during times of uncertainty and distress, it hence makes it very hard for Gold to do the same. No longer a port in the storm.
75 2018-08-20 18:19:48 Zimbos hv a problem of wanting to benefit alone while every1 else is suffering. Even those yrs when basic commodities were scarce, you would meet som1 carrying 10kg mealie meal and ask them where they bought it...they would just ignore
76 2018-08-20 18:18:17 It makes no sense to rely on a few licensed sports gambling companies to determine value and liquidity. Imagine if stocks or commodities were traded that way? No, you can't buy Apple. Yes you can sell Apple. It is absurd. 
Sports Exchange would be benefitial.
77 2018-08-20 18:14:08 It wouldn't be game over for the dollar. Commodities and currencies are simply a means to an end. And that end is the productivity/value of the private sector. The American private sector is unmatched and that is the true value of America and, in turn, the dollar.
78 2018-08-20 18:00:16 Personally that is just theories, the practicals should be seen in reality. Price of commodities must be avoidable.
79 2018-08-20 18:00:02 Commodities: Coffee -4.15%, Cocoa +4.02%
80 2018-08-20 18:00:01 Gracias por pedir mi opinión. En primer lugar, las ganancias del sector minero son producto básicamente de los precios de los commodities, factor externo, es decir, que los beneficios a la exportación son un plus residual. En ese sentido, quitarla no tendrá un gran impacto (1/3).

88 2018-08-20 17:16:26 Maybe it's better there aren't more instruments around water. I remember when people starved simply because Wall St decided to f'with the food commodities just to make some  if they could easily manipulate water, god help us all.
89 2018-08-20 17:16:16 Security Clearances aren't commodities to be traded
90 2018-08-20 17:09:24 IMO,I see between $5 and $15 by EOY,but it`s not that I believe it will hit $589,so much as,(I believe 589 represents Comex rule controling commodities)I can`t close the door because partnerships are so substantial,plus use case utlity, that it`s plausible any day of the week.
91 2018-08-20 17:04:39 Even the foreign companies that come here in the business of daily use commodities they receive prices of their own for example if you consider baby food Cerelac a packet of 75 grams costs 250 rupees means about 1300 rupees per kg now what serial is of this cast and
92 2018-08-20 17:00:34 Speaking at the Texas Energy Update on Oct 26 in Dallas.  Commodities and regional pricing panel.  May need real time feed to keep up with Permian crude diffs and Dom South gas diffs as constraints and weather change
93 2018-08-20 16:59:35 I’m also looking at the last run up in the price of wti. Share prices of e&p companies didn’t correspond in the same way. I’m thinking less big money going into commodities in 2018. Although...if some air comes out of the fang world it might find it’s way to commodities again. 
94 2018-08-20 16:55:48 When people don't have to see or live reality through the lens of someone other than themselves, why would they think race is an issue? If common sense, empathy, and ignorance were commodities, one of them would NEVER sell.
95 2018-08-20 16:49:20 WTF is this ? He’s like l marry you to 10 women ? Are they commodities? They’re women not camels .
96 2018-08-20 16:46:34 You might was well be speaking Chinese.  I made it through engineering school, so I’m confident I could understand this stuff, but this is dropping me into a graduate level convo. Can I learn this stuff by studying how traditional commodities futures work?
97 2018-08-20 16:36:49 Perhaps you (and he) are right, but I would argue as a commodity with only 1 major buyer, the u fuel cycle distorts the timing relative to other commodities.
98 2018-08-20 16:30:46 A lot of people don't know this. Any economy that prefers to import commodities including fertilizers as we used to do under the previous admins instead of renovating moribund ones is a useless government.
99 2018-08-20 16:28:48 Secular dollar bear market = strong economic growth, high inflation, rising bond yields and higher commodities. But, the elephant in the room is Chinese growth. If it slows into 2020, we may be on the verge of a dollar bull market = poor global growth/ lower commodities.
100 2018-08-20 16:25:21 That’s not hate. It’s questioning Marvel’s business practices. First issues of new series used to only be given to proven commodities who have a track record selling comics. Now they hire based ONLY on race it seems.
101 2018-08-20 16:23:38 That’s according to VantagePoint, an artificial intelligence software utilizing deep learning neural networks to forecast next-day high and low prices on equities, commodities, and currencies. The platform added cryptocurrencies last week.

103 2018-08-20 16:18:40 Also thought seemed simpler to peg it to hard asset but the price of a euro is guaranteed at 655 franc from what I’ve gleaned. So it’s not open to fluctuations in price of commodities. Also a change in price requires the entire European council, eurogroup and ECB approval
104 2018-08-20 16:14:03 I think more it's a matter of an inventory of the system's infrastructure: 1) faculty who were or are intense reputational commodities for institutions (and have been highly mobile often as a result); 1/

117 2018-08-20 15:17:24 I did not claim that you did not have the "freedom" to choose between two options. I'm saying it's absurd to view the consumption between any number of commodities under capitalism as freedom.

123 2018-08-20 15:01:19 Nigeria govmt should regulate market prices & commodities in the country at all time. Companies can't just increase price for no reason & make profit out of the masses. If prices are not regulated it destroys the economy & influence inflation in a bad way. Good decision.

176 2018-08-20 12:05:20 There is something fundamentally wrong with the human race, we treat animals and sea creatures like commodities. And because they are seen this way, by mankind, they are treated as something to abused and even thrown away like rubbish.

196 2018-08-20 10:21:58 In theory, it is easy to depress commodities: just increase debt (this is the problem of shareholders) and increase production. But what if the oil is just not in the ground anymore? More drilling and more debt does not help. In Eagle Ford and Niobrara it already happens.

233 2018-08-20 06:37:58 Tomorrow is Sallah and every food commodity in the market has skyrocketed. As a people we have fundamental issues, can we not emulate the west that brought us the religion. Christmas is even worse, commodities would multiple a hundred fold.
234 2018-08-20 06:31:42 #Commodities : 
#WTI crude jumped 0.7 percent to end Friday at $65.91 a barrel.
#Gold gained 0.9 percent to 1,184.25 an ounce.

237 2018-08-20 05:32:18 Because Indian government consider us as a commodities
238 2018-08-20 05:32:08 They are commodities. They are bought and sold. 
Simply put, as species, they cannot be held accountable for their actions, because they do not have the ability to reason.
239 2018-08-20 05:31:02 Life is fucking awkward

Time is precious

But you don't get to treat people like commodities and act like having to exercise some patience and selflessness for a change is "too much work"

Push yourself a little

Comfort is a lie
240 2018-08-20 05:22:07 The only reason why this discussion/request is possible is because voters have let themselves to be like commodities or animals that can be bunched up and sold en masse to the highest bidder. Kenyan voters need to start  using their minds, not stomachs.
241 2018-08-20 05:17:54 Not wanting to treat animals as commodities to be used is not the same as treating them like humans. Huge difference. Complexity has no bearing on someone’s right to live free from harm. Otherwise we should treat highly intelligent ppl better than others, according to you.
242 2018-08-20 05:10:59 Wage labor and banking are literally not capable of taking place without a mode of exchange mediated by Capital for the flow of commodities (the definition of a market). Keynesian Capitalism, for example, exhibits government-regulated markets.
243 2018-08-20 05:00:01 Commodities: Copper +0.80%, Wheat -0.67%
244 2018-08-20 04:49:28 I certainly hope @guanenglim find a solution for the ultra high prices of regular use of commodities like sugar. Good reveal that we are paying double what the price of global is paying. No wonder prices are high
245 2018-08-20 04:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
246 2018-08-20 04:36:20 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
247 2018-08-20 04:30:18 Capitalism, as implemented, is not given to the earth by Jesus Christ. Interests driven by profits only ensure that people are just commodities, and it discourages giving them rights that cost something on the bottom line.

255 2018-08-20 03:07:20 Surely you realize political,economic woes are not a reason for many people to leave thier homeland. Cultural, familial ties often trump the lack of commodities wealthier nations value. Millions of Americans live abroad,in far less wealthy nations.
256 2018-08-20 02:56:51 Coitado do povo venezuelano! O governo Maduro está cada vez mais podre... Populismo, ditadura e a incapacidade de enxergar que o modelo baseado só em commodities se esgotou.
257 2018-08-20 02:49:30 Who pays CFTC, FTC, etc? C'mon. Regulation means users can validate/audit and safety measures are in. Securities and commodities are not regulated AT ALL.

259 2018-08-20 02:42:45 That’s the filthy little secret behind any crypto, commodities, futures or options market: NOBODY has any idea what the hell they’re doing.  It seems to work most of the time, so folks aren’t inclined to question. But if you ask them to explain it, it’s always ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
260 2018-08-20 02:35:09 This whole #USD story seems a bit overdone. Looking for commodities to get but here into the end of the month. $GC_Z $HG_U $CL_V $ZW_U

264 2018-08-20 01:50:10 Creo que pasa porque hacer una casa nueva no es fácil (levantar un gobierno tampoco) ..podrá venir justo una  subida de precios de commodities pero eso no pasa siempre..y más cuando tenes muchos gastos inflados y difíciles de bajar.
265 2018-08-20 01:44:43 What do you guys want me to chart? I'll take some requests.
Forex, stocks, commodities
266 2018-08-20 01:42:50 commodities paling sakit this quarter. kena deal with that. Malaysian tax collection pun hambar. we basically don't pay tax at all right now i.e. Gst 0%. come sst, low government income, effect besar GDP. takleh nak harapkan domestic spending and oil revenue
267 2018-08-20 01:37:18 depa start jadi gomen at may to june in Q2. paling sakit is commodities.

269 2018-08-20 01:31:51 With so many instruments available, there's literally no reason to force a trade. 
Between #forex #stocks #Commodities and now #Crypto there's more than enough selection to pick what matches your ideal trading setup.
Trade what you see, Don't force to see what you want to trade

271 2018-08-20 01:26:35 You gotta better think about these tweets my man, for this to be valid, you would have to measure it up against other commodities and even fiat itself which you didn't care to do, bias garbage posting- try again
272 2018-08-20 01:12:18 2/3 new $MOX.AX JV allows us to remain focused on our key commodities - #nickel #copper #zinc while getting "free exposure" to the hot #vanadium space
273 2018-08-20 01:02:03 Mobile dicks are commodities
274 2018-08-20 01:01:20 E se o terremoto impactar commodities ?

277 2018-08-20 00:52:18 i miss how cheap the commodities before
278 2018-08-20 00:46:33 Bitcoin is following gold charts until bitcoin rises so high that it will push up the price of gold and other commodities.
279 2018-08-20 00:43:13 We need our mines for minerals and commodities but we also need our miners to be safe as well as our environment ! 
Less tax for those who pollute means less of a concern about us and OUR FUTURE ?
280 2018-08-20 00:40:26 Was there any way of predicting this nations lack of morality? Has that not been the progressives experience these last 30 years? We wait and wait for a decent idea to come out of their camp but all we get  are commodities replacing  our  institutions and war
281 2018-08-20 00:35:20 y'all bitcoin nerds seem to be able to understand proof of work as related to crypto, but can't seem to apply that concept to commodities, in general.
282 2018-08-20 00:27:11 if people were actually equally benefitting from the exchanging of commodities, then no one would be making a profit and capitalism would cease to exist.
283 2018-08-20 00:18:17 Those are commodities, sweetie. And by commodities, I mean things that involve the labor of others.

If you have a right to the labor of others, that would be slavery.

That is *kind of* evil.
284 2018-08-20 00:14:56 However, a multi-polar nature of commodities and deregulation of the U.S. should be denied that is called Singularitarianism.
285 2018-08-20 00:13:25 I do not do conspiracy theory, fact and truth are the only commodities that matter, exactly why you can never believe a liberal.
286 2018-08-20 00:13:05 the notion of profit is inextricably linked with capitalism.  the realization of profit is the driving force behind capitalism.  profit obscures a commodities true value, which is labor, via a third party extraction (money).
287 2018-08-20 00:12:10 @ImranKhanPTI Beautiful speech today! One thing you’re missing you should promise to take out all kind of commodities in pakistan like gold, silver, copper..thank you.
288 2018-08-20 00:07:00 simply put, because capitalists own the modes of production, there can never be a direct 1:1 exchange of goods in a capitalist society.  this is because commodities are valued by labor; not by a quantifiable third party abstraction (i.e. money).
289 2018-08-20 00:02:30 When commodities are overproduced and in abundance, aren't they typically lower in cost (i.e. steel and aluminum before tariffs, plastic, etc..)?
290 2018-08-20 00:01:32 Whether President Trump stays in the course of his policies or gets intimidated and changes them.  One thing is true:  without tariffs or taxes on foreign commodities the USA will be at the disadvantage because it does not produce smart products.
