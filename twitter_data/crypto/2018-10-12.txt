2 2018-10-13 23:59:21 Amid the vast hype, vapor and pure froth to be found in the #crypto space, there are a few diamond projects that have relentlessly developed under the radar. My fav is @IO_Coin. They invented encrypted comms on #blockchain back in 2015 still under the radar and extended to goups

5 2018-10-13 23:59:04 Chris, I'm curious as to your larger point. Should we not abolish crypto currency that is overwhelmingly mined using fossil fuels because a small % is mined using renewables?
6 2018-10-13 23:59:02 Will Vitalik be able to hold his ground and represent all crypto?
7 2018-10-13 23:58:58 The fact that politicians, scientists and journalists still listen to what people like @Nouriel have to say proves that it's time for new perspectives. Crypto is flawed, but so are the opinions of economists, who just can't or do not want to think out of the box. #bitcoin

12 2018-10-13 23:57:18 Mr Roubini, you've done noble work and more than your fair share trying to help people not get taken in by these scams. But i worry that for your own health/sanity, it may be best to let the crypto world go. It's all bad energy.

Can we expect changes in  2019? Is it the year that crypto usage finally goes mainstream? #optherium #vivuspay

29 2018-10-14 23:58:49 Physician heal thyself. Umm, there is no power and legitimacy to the fiat system of crypto especially when NO ONE USES THEM TO ACTUALLY DO TRANSACTIONS

31 2018-10-14 23:58:30 What are you talking about? Pull out a year book from the 1920s and you can see segregation.  You teach what isn’t said, but was actually documented. Why were all the Af. Am. Placed at the end of the class YB? Did B&W socialize in same places? How is life similar and different?

36 2018-10-14 23:56:59 So did he. Lol
Wrong again @Nouriel haha. 
Your irrelevant. When you going to get it?
37 2018-10-14 23:56:44 There are very few people working on making blockchain and crypto usable in the long run - so you should check one of few that does: @tenzorum (and learn from them!)

42 2018-10-12 23:57:56 Ain't that the Truth.
43 2018-10-12 23:57:38 You’re right.  People flee risk, and crypto is about as risky as it gets.  Don’t believe me, watch the price action.  When stocks dove, crypto dove more.

51 2018-10-12 23:56:50 add that last sale 'defines' price & market cap, no matter the size of that transaction. Buy BTC for $1 at a price of 20,000 USD/1 BTC and the official price for BTC is 20k USD. This extreme example is unrealistic, but 50m USD could increase the market cap by billions of Dollars.
