38 2018-04-30 21:08:49 That’s why my exposure to the TSX is limited to what’s included in the Vanguard Developed Markets ex US ETF ... too much exposure to financials & commodities in the Canadian market ...
39 2018-04-30 20:44:06 Lindy, if they had their own smart phones, then they would not work in Canada after passing a certain point north of the border. And, i am sure that the libs are handing out phones and other commodities like candy in a parade.
40 2018-04-30 20:23:39 FAMGA market cap dominance is about the concentration of advertising dollars and personalized  selling in a few companies. But some other company still has to *make* the goods and commodities they are selling.
41 2018-04-30 20:22:12 It just feels like Ireland’s systems are so flippant towards half their population.

These last few days of news are grating.

And yet, the women here are warriors.
42 2018-04-30 20:13:33 Market IV: Interesting inter-market phenomena in this last week of April include a sharp rise in U.S.-dollar-priced crude #oil even as the USD rebounds vs both the #euro and #yen. At one point, #WTI #futures reach $69.23 a barrel today. WTI now up 13% YTD #commodities
43 2018-04-30 20:09:50 Our kids futures are not commodities for you to buy, sell, and short like so many bushels of corn or hog bellies.

Beans is 5% planted
45 2018-04-30 19:42:36 Agreed. Ideal would be to create an organisation / team where players feel guilty about doing that because of the time and effort put into them. That would be a successful happy team. SA teams not quite there yet. Players = commodities

49 2018-04-30 19:02:14 A good friend of mine works at CSX Railroad & their Stock Price has been trailing the other RR significantly but over the past few weeks CSX has been trading at/near All-Time highs. Most Railroads and most Commodities should be good investments over next 6-months or so.
50 2018-04-30 18:45:00 Thinking about adding to portfolios, thoughts? Not sure the best play - I like ETFs but factors like contango can cause problems. Relative to stocks, commodities are least expensive sine the 60s.
51 2018-04-30 18:38:54 Sex is only a commodity if people are commodities. And, if that's the argument, we need to be real honest about that. And if mean sex not w/people then that needs to be clarified. And if you mean less social stigma around commodified sex (sex work) then that needs to be clarified
52 2018-04-30 18:30:32 Because we have been indoctrinated into thinking that living on atomized parcels of identical plots of lands, and filling these plots with a excess commodities, somehow represents "freedom"

57 2018-04-30 18:22:48 not sure signing undrafted free agents is the same as having known commodities at the position
58 2018-04-30 18:18:54 To me it's exaggeration and an act frustrating Ugandans. First Ugandans are being heavily taxed through the electricity, water,  and other commodities. And companies already collect a great deal of taxes through transunctions .let the govt just create more jobs.  .
59 2018-04-30 18:15:02 I’ve just been reviewing my commodities portfolio and investing in cryptocurrencies. If it makes it any less dull, I was doing so on a very old church pew with a dog asleep on my legs.

66 2018-04-30 17:46:49 I read a great thread on this. He historically is against commodities and currencies as investment. Prefers ownership in companies that transform inputs to outputs as they can gain intrinsic value. Holding gold/BTC the value only changes based on perception.
67 2018-04-30 17:40:23 You have put out a list with prices of commodities during UPA and NDA. Is LPG being sold at ₹800 and onions at ₹80 per kg? Even other commodities are overpriced as it is a propaganda picture put out by Congress followers.

75 2018-04-30 16:51:39 It is ridiculous that flying has become such a combustible social experience. I blame the airlines for treating us like commodities instead of people.

78 2018-04-30 16:49:19 The thugs at #MooiRiver are targeting trucks carrying essential commodities. Groceries.

89 2018-04-30 16:13:09 I think we've imported some disinflation (in manufactured goods) and inflation (in commodities). Not sure how it's all added up. Also domestic prices of durable goods had more deflation than imported prices...

101 2018-04-30 15:44:26 It’s really frustrating when you have so much reason to be the angry preaching vegan because people literally act like animals are commodities but being angry and preachy isn’t the way to go about educating people
102 2018-04-30 15:42:40 My least favorite is probably the Oakland Raiders. They got some talented players but I'm of the opinion that you can take a chance on some boom or bust players but you need to mitigate that with some known commodities. The Raiders went all in on risk this year. It's a toss up.

105 2018-04-30 15:24:36 The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as “an immense accumulation of commodities,”[1] its unit being a single commodity. Our investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity. (1/????)

123 2018-04-30 14:15:36 The value of money is determined by goods and services. Goods are things like food, shelter, and other commodities. If there is a shortage on food the value of money decreases which means you need more money to buy food.

160 2018-04-30 12:19:33 They can and do. They also choose to use market forces to allow reduced costs to consumers.

They also sell power to the eastern seaboard. It is a two way connector that allows SA to trade, like all commodities are.
161 2018-04-30 12:13:03 Everything is mockery, they are pretending to be charity workers. These shelter are exploiting freedom for rights and treating animals as commodities for human greed and ego.

201 2018-04-30 07:58:27 In the countries where there is ‘shitty fiat’, is Bitcoin the best basket of commodities to come up with?
This is all even assuming that fiat is only bad and can’t be made to work - which I disagree with, for now.
202 2018-04-30 07:57:07 I understand that and I understand your quoting Hayek a few times. Hayek also argued against fiat as I understand it, but offered a basket of (useful?) commodities in the place of gold. Is Bitcoin that? When liquidity demand rises, how does doing more PoW help the real economy?

219 2018-04-30 05:30:39 the problem with that thought - it is treating ppl like commodities - just votes to grab.  instead, people should be treated like people.  the people with whom painter has allied with until 2015 are the ones who created trump.  maybe painter should have stepped away years ago.
220 2018-04-30 05:23:36 The inability to manufacture is something which can be found throughout Africa.

221 2018-04-30 05:23:30 How about I tell you that no female child was born in the entire bible? Isn't that the hint of exclusion of women? It's not that women can't, it is more possible that women weren't allowed. Not a shocker, given how bible represents women as commodities in the early days.

236 2018-04-30 03:25:44 Queridão, "soberania nacional" não se vende, salvo quando há globalistas ou socialistas na área

O q se vende são produtos, commodities, bens 

Capitalismo selvagem quem o pratica é a esquerda, q ama um monopólio ou privatiza o Estado p/ poucos  (levando uma grana para si)
237 2018-04-30 03:19:01 It's almost as if they think women aren't people but commodities that could be shared...
238 2018-04-30 02:51:45 I’m not even sure where this is going anymore. Fear and hatred are commodities sold by each side
239 2018-04-30 02:46:02 Ya seremos potencia. Abrazo Charly, este es el año de los commodities.
240 2018-04-30 02:17:15 I see, so he is up for business, that's good, a client is always welcomed.

*He is peering at the young woman's commodities, he is listening to her, yes but also thinking about he is in the mood for some rabbit and maybe something else as he eyes the meat*

Ah well, not exactly -
241 2018-04-30 02:04:41 Because she has a history of using Asian people & culture as commodities. The Your Love video. The Harujuku Barbie era she indulged in & now with Chun-Li. (These are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head) So I get why she was cited.
242 2018-04-30 02:01:22 Maybe increase the romaine lettuce? High demand, low supply atm. Bullish on romaine commodities
243 2018-04-30 01:50:27 Mostly because the stigma no longer exists.  Images of those like Che Guevara were turned into commodities.

But in the past a lot of those alienated from society drifted towards radical leftist ideas.  Jewish people in Tsarist Russia are a great example.
244 2018-04-30 01:49:21 Property, our homes!, have been made into commodities. To be ‘traded’ on the market. That is an absolute disaster. QE is about as financially criminal as it gets. How do you “reverse” it? Tell the banks (markets) to give the ‘money’ back? Sure..!
245 2018-04-30 01:47:12 Cingapura foi um exemplo prático disso: Há 50 anos atrás era uma imensa favela. O mesmo país optou por adotar uma economia aberta, voltada a serviços, e investiu pesadamente em educação. Hoje é um dos maiores PIB`s do mundo.

Detalhe: Cingapura não tem agricultura, commodities.
246 2018-04-30 01:44:45 @ThePivotKing Is there a reason you don't trade forex or just that you make money with commodities so no need to do something else? 
I assume your indicators and pivots would work with forex?

#Oil trades with negative bias second day running
#Metals closed lower on LME
#Aluminum down 10% last week
248 2018-04-30 01:34:50 Positive surprise on both China PMIs could support industrial commodities. Aluminium and copper up, oil yet to respond

254 2018-04-30 00:58:24 Todo lo que decís es así, salvo mi intenciön de adjudicarle nada a nadie. Mi tuit inicial fue para discutir la etiqueta de fracaso usada por Berensztein. Por las razones que sea (contexto internacional, commodities, etc., Uruguay ha mejorado sus indicadores. Solo eso.
255 2018-04-30 00:53:31 I think this effort to save our country has COST our dear @POTUS and his family a significant amount of money! I sincerely appreciate the sacrifice that everyone is making! Our offspring won't be debt-serfs/sex-slaves/disposable commodities now. Thank GOD!
256 2018-04-30 00:50:47 @GonzaNavarreteM en su entrevista con #CNNCHILE hace unos minutos, utiliza reiteradas veces el término "commodities". Con esto, ¿Se refiere a la dependencia que tenemos de por ejemplo, el cobre?.
Gracias!

258 2018-04-30 00:27:36 Con Néstor empezó el GRAN SAQUEO, pero con las cuentas (seguramente gracias a $ de las commodities) marchando bien, luego continuó el saqueo ya en marcha y encima la mesiánica arruinando todo en el país con sus delirios populistas, que le daban votos..
259 2018-04-30 00:14:37 I think  is AUD/ USD is bottom and it will surprise the market and the shorter  by coming back to 79 area or over 80 soon because High commodities price ,strong world economy growth and Mr Trump always reject strong USA dollar  and Aussie is artificial down .
