37 2018-07-16 21:40:55 El exportador le traslada el impuesto al productor debido a que la elasticidad de la demanda es alta en commodities, eso quiere decir que no podes cobrarle el impuesto a quien te compra la soja sino que la termina pagando el productor via menor precio.
38 2018-07-16 21:28:41 We also need to have a much more serious debate about privacy, social media, and individual citizens control over any information or data generated about them.

78 2018-07-16 18:17:58 Capitalism- Generalized commodity production. 
"socialist commodity production"- A bad term, but it should simply describe the very minimal exchange of commodities that has not been phased out yet. Very different to the the generalized commodity production under capitalism.

90 2018-07-16 17:32:16 French corporations such as the construction company Bolloré, the oil giant Total and the telecoms group Orange maintain a massive presence in the Africa region. French companies import commodities such as uranium ore from Niger and Gabon or cocoa from Ivory Coast.

228 2018-07-16 05:15:02 I think it should be in shape of commodities like herd of sheep, general store, construction materials, transport bus van,or any such business
229 2018-07-16 05:00:02 Commodities: Oat +4.62%, Corn +2.98%
230 2018-07-16 04:51:36 Imran while comparing prices of commodities said,  in America, milk is Rs60/liter while in Pakistan, it us PKR 120. This is absolutely untrue. In US 1 leter milk us for $1.20 which makes it PKR145/liter.
231 2018-07-16 04:15:15 Yes, but the drawback is when China no longer needs those commodities ignoring the secular slow down there
232 2018-07-16 04:08:29 Oh. My. God. Black Children. Children of Color. Commodities for corrupt, greedy, individuals, organization owners, detention center owners. Government take children from families. Children placed in detention centers, children homes, foster homes and they ALL make  govt money
233 2018-07-16 04:08:08 O jogo no tabuleiro é Rússia e China contra EUA .
Todo o resto é coadjuvante . 
Nesse jogo somos as commodities , nada mais .
234 2018-07-16 04:06:03 Except Australia mainly provides commodities vs actually having a supply chain like SK or Japan
235 2018-07-16 04:02:17 Others, in response to the social and environmental harm caused by the cultivation, harvesting and extraction of commodities, have sought to make supply chains more sustainable through consumer boycotts and certification initiatives. #JurisdictionalApproach #INOBU
236 2018-07-16 03:51:20 Only premium grade commodities. S/o @_AmbyRayBans
237 2018-07-16 03:46:14 Read Gundlach article on Yield Curve collapsing causing recession BUT industrial commodities going up at same time
238 2018-07-16 03:46:00 Yea man start stackin on commodities, precious metals, guns and ammo oh and water
239 2018-07-16 03:45:03 Having worked in multiple commodities over 20+ years none can claim their entire industry is sustainable. I don't see calls for absolute proof ALL cocoa or ALL beef is sustainble. Progress is happening in palm oil and that should be encouraged
240 2018-07-16 03:25:46 people are not who you think // they’re neighbors to love, not commodities to use
241 2018-07-16 03:19:14 Is it the same link where you guys were discussing about girls like "commodities"?
242 2018-07-16 03:18:47 @DuctorMarcus boa noite, Marcus. vc tem reação das commodities após dados da China? viu a produção industrial em junho abaixo do esperado?
243 2018-07-16 03:18:21 RT EagleOnEagleSt: DavidLenigas BramwellWayne Artemis_ARV ARV is a sleeping giant... looking forward to the next major commodities bull run, and what ARV will bring to the table

247 2018-07-16 02:32:47 3. Europe needs to back its currencies with gold, silver, other commodities, other government owned lands.  Reduce unemployment Europe with Civilian Conservation Corps, Marshall Plans, etc.
248 2018-07-16 02:18:26 I cant remember the last good call he made
BTW, Has anyone ever asked him why a bond manager is making predictions about stocks and commodities ?
249 2018-07-16 01:46:40 No understanding of economics. SA is not a Socialist state, and when it comes to commodities, it is not an island. It needs the world. But, we let the trade unions free reign to mess with labour and the economy. Our politicians and unions have/are destroying the economy.
250 2018-07-16 01:39:58 No le suena la recesión que sufrió América latina debido a la caída de los precios de los commodities
251 2018-07-16 01:39:02 Relative to my previous tweet concerning copper....some of you-had you followed my opinion would have made some good money this evening (depending on the number of contracts purchased). Tonight's opening bid was 2.776....and tonight's high was 2.798.....do the math...#commodities
252 2018-07-16 01:38:14 @smartertrader Sam do you have any thoughts on commodities? Will Trumps tariffs continue to hurt soy bean exports or do you think a deal will be made and prices rebound?
253 2018-07-16 01:36:42 We might actually get a four (4) entry this evening....what we got earlier was a two (2) point entry....2.7970-2805....lets see what happens...Again, it's just my opinion. #commodities
254 2018-07-16 01:35:58 Si ojo que describo lo que ellos piensan, pero tienen otros problemas contextuales:
-precios de commodities no tan altos
-no hay boom de ventas
-default que evitó pagos de intereses y refinanciación
Por eso creo haberte comentado q p/salir que no se puede aplicar pol econ K std
255 2018-07-16 01:30:35 Expecting a recession and liking commodities are kinda mutually exclusive. He's trolling us.
256 2018-07-16 01:20:05 I'm don't know as much about commodities, other than Oil to the extent I have to for FX, but as to QE and the potential for inflation, it largely didn't happen because money (reserves, granted not exactly the same) was sterilized by IOER, so it just became a giant asset swap.
257 2018-07-16 01:19:53 Commodities?? 

While Trump is waging an economic war with tariffs?
258 2018-07-16 01:11:07 Bc Chicago Board of Trade deals in ‘stocks’ known as commodities, commodities that feed the world, impacting millions of people’s livelihood and ability to eat. #FDJT
259 2018-07-16 01:05:03 3242: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
260 2018-07-16 01:02:10 It's capitalism that closes down stores people need and prices up goods so you can't afford them.  Commodities: turning the food supply of the country over to gamblers.  Now that's stupid.  A good socialist government would support prices by buying low, and have food standing by
261 2018-07-16 00:47:22 IAT will be used to stop volatility in the worth of the merchant's commodities and services #IAT #ICO
262 2018-07-16 00:46:11 New Imaginative Commodities of the Territorial State
263 2018-07-16 00:46:03 The color of a farmer's skin has nothing to do with the effect of Trump's tariffs on the sales of farm commodities.
264 2018-07-16 00:36:55 He is not really right in the way he said it.  Yes they are 2 different commodities but gas is made from oil and the price is directly affected the oil price.
265 2018-07-16 00:26:30 2 different commodities, he's correct.
266 2018-07-16 00:20:02 President Trump needs to get us out of the UN and redevelop the space into taxable commodities.
267 2018-07-16 00:15:03 Talked with a guy this weekend who said that "commodities were too aggressive" ... they are not!  I hear this a lot ... leverage can effect all investments.  Buy cryptocurrencies with leverage and see what happens ... NO ONE SAYS YOU HAVE  TO LEVERAGE FUTURES TO THE MAX!
268 2018-07-16 00:14:20 haha heavens no. all these are bourgeois democratic reforms. all developed capitalist countries went through the same. they had land reform to break up feudalism and industrialization to create commodities they needed
269 2018-07-16 00:12:53 Morning all!

Welcome to Monday's Asian session.

270 2018-07-16 00:10:12 Which commodities? Gold and Silver have been a 5 year disaster.
271 2018-07-16 00:06:45 Opinions are the cheapest commodities on Earth.
272 2018-07-16 00:02:39 Yes but Scarcity can also be created! Most commodities are plentiful + likely overvalued. Do you like Rolex? Not much difference when you look at it. People like “rare” so “rare” is created so people like it more
