1 2018-10-01 23:58:49 I cut mine in half, put in a ziploc bag with olive oil, kosher salt& ground black pepper. I let marinate for a few hours. Then I put them in the broiler with bacons &/or pecans! Yummmm!

3 2018-10-01 23:58:37 Did I miss the part where they said "our guy was way out of bounds and we accept full responsibility?" Because I didn't see that part anywhere...
4 2018-10-01 23:58:35 Dude. Just found out my rents be putting CBD oil in our dogs food. No wonder she’s so chill after she eats. Ps. She’s old af and it helps her hips and joints too.
5 2018-10-01 23:58:33 Yeh, I guess 3.5cents/litre is pretty unaffordable. Never mind the 40 odd cents fuel’s increased over the last few months due to international oil prices. You Nats are un, fucking, believable! 
6 2018-10-01 23:58:26 I have a deep craving for chicken tenders, because I made an Arby’s joke earlier. Help.

Tender aficionados: Which common chain has the best ones? Any store brands worth a damn for oven cooking? (No frying. I’m too stupid to trust with oil.)

8 2018-10-01 23:58:12 Even CBD oil ?  I would worry that the B injection would give him more energy
9 2018-10-01 23:57:59 Man and the bread with the oil n shii  fuck 
10 2018-10-01 23:57:59 Could save even more if the populace would hold half the disdain for corporate welfare that they do for individual families and keep the GOP oil lobbyists out of our government.
11 2018-10-01 23:57:56 yesss   You better believe I'm also drinking warm apple cider and mixing autumn themed essential oil blends for my diffuser!!

13 2018-10-01 23:57:40 Broke the record for highest mileage over due for an oil change <3 #justgirlythings
14 2018-10-01 23:57:34 Had a full tank last night anticipating the oil price hike today.
15 2018-10-01 23:57:21 Wait, we can't buy oil now?
16 2018-10-01 23:57:20 Not sure I agree with that. Harper was much more aggressive on pipelines, oil, and other resources like steel and aluminium. He probably would have worked to fix the huge discount on Canadian oil as well as the global permitting fear related to building pipelines in Canada.
17 2018-10-01 23:57:17 Unless the company buys up all the supply products and transport networks, as in the Standard Oil example. Not sure how much that happens today, especially because of regulations enacted back then to curtail such activities . Not sure how much of that legislation is still used
18 2018-10-01 23:57:14 ...And in Canada, the Fake-liberal Party gov't & the downright treasonous Conservatives [opposition party] both vow to dramatically increase tar-sands oil production & not to ban any petroleum byproducts, e.g., plastics that end up in our three oceans.
Nice going, Big Oil lackies
19 2018-10-01 23:57:14 Ha ha. Yes. Do you understand the term “relative”. The reason people in poor countries don’t have the same commodities as we do isn’t because they cost more for them in real terms. It’s because they cost more for them in relative terms. A gal of oil might cost them a mnths wages

40 2018-10-01 23:57:13 So my friend sent me a surprise package with a facial oil she told me was a miracle worker for dry patches, and I'm obviously so thankful, but I feel bad for still being slightly disappointed it wasn't my Janelle merch

48 2018-10-01 23:55:55 The dude is a snake oil salesman. Loves to hear the sound of his own voice!
49 2018-10-01 23:55:52 She and I were oil and water but a good duo when we'd try haha. Miss her everyday. Two years December 19th, for me. Sorry for your loss phriend <3 if we ever meet at a show we'll have to pour out a sip out for 'em and dance extra funky.
50 2018-10-01 23:55:51 If you use the extra pizza dough to bake like a little loaf of bread, but then take a slice of that bread and cover it in garlic oil, melt cheese all over it and dip that slice of cheesy garlic pizza dough bread in some marinara, can you still call it a piece of pizza?
51 2018-10-01 23:55:48 Should be a tough one for
52 2018-10-01 23:55:45 Mam- How a common man can understand all these stuff ? He/she can only see how much money they spend for day to day life ? Bring oil price down and make rupee stronger..
53 2018-10-01 23:55:44 I luv taking my car in for an oil change and them telling me a thousand things are broken and that I’m gonna die if I don’t get 4 new tires 
54 2018-10-01 23:55:41 Oil changes & full service were a part of Daddy-Daughter time. When we bring our cars, it’s under your name. I’ll never change that..

we hit up Tepanyaki after  #iLoveYou & I miss you more.
55 2018-10-01 23:55:33 Funny you mention that.  Just tried an oil created that day for the first time. Feels like I drank a gallon of coffee. I've been flying around the house, swooping on tasks everywhere I see them. Its to-do list crack. Works as an oil, not sure I'd want to talisman it.
56 2018-10-01 23:55:04 This company needs be broken up like ATT and Standard Oil were.
57 2018-10-01 23:54:41 Are full service oil change businesses no longer "full service"? Truck is low on washer fluid, I had just taken it to @Midas on Friday. Obviously they didn't check all the levels.

62 2018-10-01 23:53:59 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
63 2018-10-01 23:53:38 So I made a diy hair mask this morning for my mom and ugh I guess I used too much oil.  Better luck next time I guess. I just like mixing everything together. JBCO, onions, cinnamon, avocAdo, banana, HBCO, olive oil, cinnamon, avocado oil and cayenne pepper.

67 2018-10-01 23:53:04 I have a big ole scar on my arm from cleaning a flat top grill. We use hot fryer oil and a pumice brick to clean it, didn’t notice a pool of grease in the corner. Splashed up onto my arm, second degree oil burn is the worst pain I’ve experienced

78 2018-10-01 23:50:44 The place I go to get my oil changed is great, they always top it up as well as my windshield wiper and transmission fluid but like once in a while it would be great if they topped up my gas tank as well. #JustSaying

91 2018-10-01 23:48:16 hate to be one of those “life hack” thread twitters or whatever tf you call them , but if y’all ever want hella soft, shiny hair mix coffee grounds with olive oil and slap that sh*t in your hair and leave it on for 15-20 mins. You’re welcome.
92 2018-10-01 23:47:44 spaces out thinkin about this doujin panel i get to ink soon where enji's face is all drenched in oil and hes about to be brutally tortured and gently drooling to myself
93 2018-10-01 23:47:42 I'm not sure Q will want to release Free Energy either.  It would hurt Gas, Coal, and Oil industries.  Doesn't anyone care about Pollution?!
94 2018-10-01 23:47:37 As someone with a chronic pain condition who has tried multiple different things to treat their pain I can tell you that CBD oil does NOT work for everyone. All CBD oil did for me was make me drowsy. Nothing for pain. THC on the other hand has helped cut through my pain.
95 2018-10-01 23:47:32 Weird question for you Q- would cannabis in some form safe for dogs stimulate his appetite??  Or fish oil?  Both can be used in humans to stimulate appetite & hopefully combat unwanted weight loss. Just wondered if it might help him. 
96 2018-10-01 23:47:16 Indeed--or going further back, Nye, Frazier, NPL in the 20s, 30s, then the lurch to the right in the 40s. One Q is whether oil has driven ND so far to the right that the state is now more like WY politically.
97 2018-10-01 23:47:02 One more oil change before winter. Make sure the maintenance on my whip is good. Winter too brutal.
98 2018-10-01 23:47:01 What *leverage* did we have negotiating with an economy 10X ours, other than supply chain disruption/higher costs for Detroit? During NAFTA 1.0, Canada's  strategic oil reserves gave us real leverage given historic US reliance on OPEC. That evaporated with US energy independence.
99 2018-10-01 23:46:47 she think I’m playing but my face lit lit right now cause of this coconut oil 
100 2018-10-01 23:46:45 How many miles does a traditional oil change last for? I’m pretty sure I’ve maxed out that amount
101 2018-10-01 23:46:45 oh fuck that’s bad. ya my cartilage ones haven’t fully healed and it’s been almost a year now. the only things that helped were tea tree oil and not changing the earring too much

145 2018-10-01 23:40:22 Just did my first oil change on my truck and I kind of feel like a parent who just cut their kids hair for the first time..
146 2018-10-01 23:40:20 Depends on the type of avocado.  Haas avocados tastes like watered down dirt.  But the regular ones...those are good, especially if you add a little vinegar and oil dressing...
147 2018-10-01 23:40:20 Did you check oil when you c got home?  Make sure they put some in
148 2018-10-01 23:40:18 もうすっかり秋の空、秋の空気やね
149 2018-10-01 23:40:16 Thing is... respectful and Riley are like oil and water, or some other immiscible solution. 
150 2018-10-01 23:40:14 @dream925fm I see Nigeria like a rich man Son who will gradually restructure himself after loosing his Father (the father is our oil) #LateNights with @SoulSistaNeka #UpclosenPersonal #IndependenceDaySpecial
151 2018-10-01 23:40:14 Delta with Norway largely explained by oil and gas revenue; hence the fluctuations. Delta with Denmark not insurmountable with coherent macroeconomic planning. Labour policy now a clear divergence from neoliberalism, unlike SNP. Leaving UK would be 4 times worse than leaving EU.
152 2018-10-01 23:40:14 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
153 2018-10-01 23:40:09 True.  The only conferences I've been to in more recent years have been oil & gas conferences so there's a relatively low bar.
154 2018-10-01 23:40:07 แค่นี้ก็ดีมากแล้ววว
155 2018-10-01 23:39:54 お隣さんの訃報だ
156 2018-10-01 23:39:38 ได้แค่นี้แหละค่า เอาชนะตัวเองไม่ได้เลย รู้สึกท้อแท้ไปหมด ปั่นได้ขนาดนี้ก็บุญหัวแล้ว
157 2018-10-01 23:39:38 Cari argania spinosa kernel oil, cold-pressed, origin morocco.
158 2018-10-01 23:39:35 where you get that coconut oil from it’s PERFECT @reddcheeks_
159 2018-10-01 23:39:32 okay stfu n get us some oil
160 2018-10-01 23:39:26 I need get a oil change
161 2018-10-01 23:39:25 Yeah, exactly what toxins are these natural supplements fighting? What is the current going price for snake oil?
162 2018-10-01 23:39:01 A comment in a post about the oil price hike:
“Use other modes of transpo. Mg bike. Be disciplined”
Then a reply got me laughing:
“Makapag bike nga from Bulacan to Manila. Thanks sa advice!”
Hahahahah
163 2018-10-01 23:38:55 Awesome how Trump and the Republicans let the Land &
Water Conservation Fund, which provides for public land and access projects in all 50 states at no cost to taxpayers, expire on Sunday. Apparently they were too busy making America great again... for oil & gas corporations
164 2018-10-01 23:38:43 Pan roasted with garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper & a squirt of fresh lemon juice.  Simple & yummy!
165 2018-10-01 23:38:39 Pulled a rookie mistake and cooked over the frying pan in a sports bra. I got hot oil on my belly 
166 2018-10-01 23:38:24 I don't know how I'm going to live without my @SolanaLuxe facial oil once I run out
167 2018-10-01 23:38:23 cars can run on water, you can run nuclear energy from thorium, tesla tower, hemp oil ect.
168 2018-10-01 23:38:07 วอร์มเครื่องไปเรื่อยๆ ไปไวเดี๋ยวเบรคแตก
169 2018-10-01 23:37:44 Damn I'm feelin' hella accomplished. Just finished all my homework, changed my oil and put in a new filter. #TodayIsAGoodDay
170 2018-10-01 23:37:29 @timothysykes I bought IGC stock @ $.56 .....because they were a CBD oil stock that addressed Alzheimers...if they are right $12 is nothing
171 2018-10-01 23:37:19 USA is the second highest polluter on earth. The increase in oil output and drilling likely makes USA the worst. The celebrities like Leo Dicaprio goes from country to country pointing out there faults. Hopefully he stays home and protests your pollution.
172 2018-10-01 23:37:05 I believe Mr Sohail is quite right. To Tax for Revenue is not the only solution. You should see there are places in Baluchistan where oil boils out to the surface, gold mines, marble, gypsum, yellow cake, gem stone mining, copper mines, coal.There is so much to do....
173 2018-10-01 23:36:47 มันเร่งแหละ แต่คนทำเอื่อยเร่งเครื่องไม่ขึ้น
174 2018-10-01 23:36:47 oil blotting sheet + facial mist does the trick for me!
175 2018-10-01 23:36:43 We would love to help you with your interest in cbd oil! What benefits are you looking for?
176 2018-10-01 23:36:31 End of the gold standard in 1971-73 followed by the two oil shocks (mainly caused by dollar denomination of oil trade), followed by manufacturing globalization and mass immigration post 1980 holding down wages. Real divergence is post 1980.
177 2018-10-01 23:36:15 I see the Yoons have stopped mentioning the price of Oil now. As it nears nearly 90 dollars a barrel. Not that Scotland benefits any by having it. As WM has been squandering our black gold for decades now.
178 2018-10-01 23:36:08 We are happy you have found relief through CBD oil! 
179 2018-10-01 23:35:55 Please stop pouring oil on the flames of partisan hate-mongering. Its not about GOP or Dems its about the integrity of the SCOTUS. If BK lied thats disqualifying at minimum. If accusers lied they deserve jail. Use your platform to heal the cultural wounds not rip them deeper.
180 2018-10-01 23:35:53 Any Vespas  or oil cans hiding in that sand?  
181 2018-10-01 23:35:42 Plastic is made from oil, the greedy oil companys don't give a hoot about anything but profit. Oil and plastic are killing this planet but the problem is how to stop these plastics companys..?? Teresa May says it will take 25yrs to sort it out, I'm with you.
182 2018-10-01 23:35:39 Oil hits $84, Nigerian cargoes struggle for buyers
183 2018-10-01 23:35:19 FACT: It refers to the discovery of electricity in the 19th century, nervous systems used oil.
184 2018-10-01 23:35:17 เยี่ยมไปเล้ยยย ฮ่าาา งานเร่งเหรอ
185 2018-10-01 23:35:06 Then I guess the we are going to have to develop the oil sands.  Idiots
186 2018-10-01 23:35:04 Pake face oil, kalo bisa toner nya di layer
187 2018-10-01 23:34:58 Hope he uses cannabis oil to boost his immune system. Godspeed @PaulAllen
188 2018-10-01 23:34:43 ยังไม่ได้นอนเลยจะเจ็ดโมงเช้า ฮ่า
189 2018-10-01 23:34:31 You’d be a fool to buy anything from that snake oil salesman....
190 2018-10-01 23:34:31 I've never seen a holographic program this detailed before. I swear I can almost smell the gun oil.
191 2018-10-01 23:34:26 So, let me get this straight. You refuse to buy Canadian because of fake feminists not buying ethical Alberta oil?
192 2018-10-01 23:34:21 Mr Lou.@LouDobbs 

One YUGGGEE Problem you failed to mention in speaking of Trump's Great Economic Recovery. 

.@POTUS .@realDonaldTrump has not addressed the Major Backbreaker for US Citizens, Rising Crude Oil/ Gas Prices which is Out of Control. #FoodCosts
193 2018-10-01 23:34:18 きっと労ってくれてるんやろなぁ
194 2018-10-01 23:34:14 Honestly im great, need oil for your car? Check this forehead bro.
195 2018-10-01 23:34:03 ふんぎやー、3日ライブ厳しそうやなぁ……
196 2018-10-01 23:33:55 I always just slap some vitamin e oil on my fave on nights where im too lazy to do my routine
197 2018-10-01 23:33:44 My sister inspired this in me early on. She said you never know when your going to meet him but if you're looking good he'll come find you when you least expect it (in heels to drop of the car for an oil change). She's engaged now. 
198 2018-10-01 23:33:39 ยังไม่นอนรึเพิ่งตื่น
199 2018-10-01 23:33:37 @oil_shaeikh why
200 2018-10-01 23:33:30 Getting my oil change now, taking advantage of my free time, now i can start working out 
201 2018-10-01 23:33:28 最近琴葉が笑ってくれてる夢をよく見る

203 2018-10-01 23:33:01 Trim, cut in half lengthwise. Peel and cut sweet potatoes into 3/4” cubes. Toss with extra virgin coconut oil, Napa Valley Naturals Grand Reserve Balsalmic, ground pepper, salt. Cover with foil, bake until soft. Uncover and roast until browned.
204 2018-10-01 23:32:48 gave my doggie his hemp oil. he's chill af.
205 2018-10-01 23:32:47 My heart is heavy as an oil drum.
I don't want to be alone.
My heart is yellow as an ear of corn,
and I have torn my soul apart, from
pulling artlessly with fool commands.
Some nights
I just never go to sleep at all,
and I stand,
shaking in my doorway like a sentinel,
206 2018-10-01 23:32:46 It looks as if we did not pay the oil bill Lakers down 22 11
207 2018-10-01 23:32:45 I need my bless oil from pastor so I can anoint my new place when I move.. I’m already praying but I need to anoint and pray.
208 2018-10-01 23:32:45 Only Greedy Colonialist like britain @theresa_may will be in support of One Nigeria Unity due to Biafran oil wealth
209 2018-10-01 23:32:44 Could be the next audiophile snake oil market.
210 2018-10-01 23:32:42 I cannot believe how much a oil change costs. Terrorists
211 2018-10-01 23:32:35 I hope so, they had some chicken flavored oil for pets haha
212 2018-10-01 23:32:34 Like some clever business person should bring us all the way back with indian pickles, greentruffles in oil and walnut catsup. This is the hipsterfood dublin deserves.
213 2018-10-01 23:32:28 Military Industrial Complex doesn't mind handing over a M-249 to a 18 year old to steal oil or gaurd poppy fields.

215 2018-10-01 23:31:54 8 years? That’s pre-Brexit. 

After Brexit, it will only take a week of learning the different uses for snake oil and doctors will qualify.
216 2018-10-01 23:31:41 unless you work in dairy, agriculture, oil&gas, steel, aluminium, etc...
217 2018-10-01 23:31:36 Milk has the largest lobby group as it is a large sum of people (votes) but; oil and gas is the smallest and has the largest GDP effect.
218 2018-10-01 23:31:35 The AMA is primarily a lobbying group to which less 33% of physicians belong. Their positions are about as “factual” as the oil lobby’s “facts” on global warming. If you choose to trust their views, that’s your right. My experiences lead me to question both their... 1/
219 2018-10-01 23:31:26 Let me guess, Franklin Graham?? Or another snake oil salesman masquerading as a prophet? With this regression in the Evangelicals, I’m surprised they haven’t started a “Make Crusades Great Again” campaign by now
220 2018-10-01 23:31:05 58 years back, we are farming with a Hoe.. and yet still farming with a Hoe.

58 years back, we depend on crude oil as sole source of income.. & yet we still depend on crude oil.

58 years back, we are not industrialized.. & yet still not industrialized 

What are we celebrating?
221 2018-10-01 23:30:56 My son works at a restaurant and he gave me one of their best Brussels sprout recipes   You take the Brussels coat them in truffle oil ( i did half truffle half olive ) toss in some peanuts and roast until brown. Delicious !
222 2018-10-01 23:30:51 on the upside, courgette and aubergine are both wonderful grilled and then marinated in herbs with a drizzle of olive oil
223 2018-10-01 23:30:41 I’m proud to announce that once I start using this tea tree oil regularly it’s all over for you hoes!
224 2018-10-01 23:30:37 Maybe he & Alex Jones can do a duo road show together? Sell snake oil on the side?
225 2018-10-01 23:30:31 Venezuela's problems are a result of the US sanctions. They have the biggest oil reserves in the world and the US wants Regime change for that Oil. Same old same old.

228 2018-10-01 23:30:18 $AMRN nobody is buying a snake oil business.. no BO, just pumpers.
229 2018-10-01 23:30:16 Because our 'leaders' are on the take / oil money.
230 2018-10-01 23:30:11 I love how car inspectors will fail a new car for tires or wiper blades that are a little worn but pass the guy in the 1993 Civic that burns oil, has zipties holding the bumper on, and Flex Seal tape holding the windshield together.

232 2018-10-01 23:29:49 Donald Trump's military has bombed and killed Russians in Syria. Through energy Independence, the US is now the number one oil producer in the world. I'd say that Putin and the Russians are not getting their money's worth out of Trump.
233 2018-10-01 23:29:49 She’s so vain she’d rather use oil instead of chemo because she doesn’t wanna lose her hair because she runs a modeling company etc.  this of course is 100% her choice but I feel it’s foolish.
234 2018-10-01 23:29:47 Was it Whale oil that said something like "if they didn't have fannys we would throw rocks at them"? All these men in power seem to have this deep-seated hatred of women.

238 2018-10-01 23:28:41 A globalist, are you? International communities are shit as long as 1) US has oil; 2) US has largest trade deficit (I.e. largest demand); 3) Most powerful military. It doesn’t matter who is president, US is hegemony.
239 2018-10-01 23:28:34 @jiffylube Your company has completely destroyed my car!!! Your mecahinc adjusted my indicator after I told him not to and now my car indicates a needed oil change later than it should and now I have a blown head gasket!!!!! You need to have them to fix it asap

241 2018-10-01 23:28:16 "Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years. Which I'm looking forward to. It's an Amish technique. It's like slapping someone with silence. I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna".
242 2018-10-01 23:27:44 $XOP (Oil & Gas Exploration #ETF) lagging benchmark #crude #oil and #WTI crude today by a sizable margin. I hope and expect to see a big move up tomorrow or at least in the next few days.

244 2018-10-01 23:27:24 Not like Iran doesn't know day when cold war would become a hot war. It could blockade the entire Persian gulf and send oil prices skyrocketing. 

Qatar been screwed waiting for that stand off....as PNG Natural Gas producer and exporter to OPEC.

249 2018-10-01 23:27:08 Before u buy an expensive one please try the olive oil one @ Trader Joe’s it’s my fave
250 2018-10-01 23:26:54 Plastic is a great material in itself, the problem is waste, bad design and single use.
Just wait till the oil runs out - future generations will be cursing how wasteful we were, while also mining every landfill for recyclables.
251 2018-10-01 23:26:40 Macam mana nk reapply? Basuh pakai cleansing oil pastu pakai balik ke?
252 2018-10-01 23:26:39 Sarah wanted to try vinegar on her salad but she thought vinegar was clear and ended up covering her salad in olive oil instead.

257 2018-10-01 23:25:22 Anyone want to get me oil for my pen? ya girl ran out
258 2018-10-01 23:25:02 Great article... There are so many catalysts for this stock, never thought we’d see $10 again, not when oil prices are >$70.. turning FCF positive in 2019/becoming self-funding so they will no longer need to fund growth w/ equity will be the biggest catalyst of them all. #OOTT
259 2018-10-01 23:24:45 It was exactly because of lack govt regulations that Standard OIl and other huge companies achieved their huge monopolies. Then after there was such an imbalance and everyone was getting screwed, then govt  stepped in to break them up and impose regulations to end bad practices
260 2018-10-01 23:24:17 //I was sitting outside, waiting for the oil to heat up, and my cat was walking around the chair I was in. I sneezed, apparently very loudly, and she just went and yeeted herself away. Very quick girl.

262 2018-10-01 23:24:04 i have yet to find a CBD oil that works for me and i dont want to pay the price of higher doses if they arent going to work, so i havent really explored options
263 2018-10-01 23:24:03 58 years back, we are farming with a Hoe.. and yet still farming with a Hoe.

265 2018-10-01 23:23:57 I love how:

—my skin stays warm all day after I work out in the morning

—red fountain pen ink looks in my notebook in the sun 

—olive oil smells as soon as it warms up even a little
266 2018-10-01 23:23:50 What if I said, “any girl who wants to work on cars and change oil isn’t straight to me”
267 2018-10-01 23:23:40 Time for an oil change. $70 cover it #findom
268 2018-10-01 23:23:03 It runs on corn oil
269 2018-10-01 23:23:00 Olive oil and grapeseed oil have antioxidants that will help remove lotion. It will also help prevent breakouts.
270 2018-10-01 23:22:42 i feel as if anything i buy that has “coconut oil” in it is instantly going to fix any acne i might have, split ends, dry skin, etc.
271 2018-10-01 23:22:22 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
272 2018-10-01 23:22:21 @dpradhanbjp Today, Brent oil has touched USD 85, everytime when public ask u to reduce enhanced exice, u were telling oil will soften, u r just kidding, people hv right for reduced excise, similar to when u were increasing excise, when crude was decreasing.
273 2018-10-01 23:22:21 Lmao that’s complimentary with most oil changes
274 2018-10-01 23:22:19 Nope wont be doing any of that. I dont even change the oil in the van.
275 2018-10-01 23:21:55 I feel something that is almost sympathy for people who, when they are going to meet me, google my name and think they're meeting productivity guy and instead I look like I just finished changing their cousin's sister's oil and could use a five for gas.

285 2018-10-01 23:20:53 Most of them have to be bribed to come here.   My main beef is keeping the natural resources in the ground because of fake science and virtue signalling. We sell oil to the US for $35/brl and buy it for $70.  Real smart.
286 2018-10-01 23:20:49 Holy shit! What caused the oil to erupt?
287 2018-10-01 23:20:47 You could make a case for it.  He’s basically pro pollution, chemicals, coal, oil, asbestos, locking children in cages and rape. I wonder sometimes if he is trying to cause riots in the streets to enact martial law creating a police state.

290 2018-10-01 23:20:03 Not to mention the oil industry receives like $3.5 billion in annual subsidies in Canada. It is heavily subsidized. Meat gets subsidies. Timber is in essence subsidized due to the artificially low stumpage cost created by allowing use of crown land.

292 2018-10-01 23:20:03 @MarkRPellegrino I think the fact you would want to help people is very admirable. Would you, or anyone you know put conditions on that help? That money? Those food stamps? That heating oil check (you must set your heat to 68 degrees). Because that's what ppl would want 2 do...
293 2018-10-01 23:19:41 Bitch I found a pack of daler rowney oil paints for 6.99

294 2018-10-01 23:19:24 Yup......all that cooking oil and shortening I’m hauling out of Illinois came from imported corn and soybeans and the huge plants that produce it USA figment of my imagination........

298 2018-10-01 23:18:45 Hey Rune! You want to get a cbd oil that is full spectrum from high quality hemp, in a fractionated coconut MCT oil, that will be most effective. However KOI is a little greedy as their price is quite high...

310 2018-10-01 23:16:38 I've also heard really wonderful things about using the oil to help minimize seizures. I hope more research will be done on that once it's legalized, too!

316 2018-10-01 23:15:13 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed

318 2018-10-01 23:15:06 It is indeed a sound economic argument, with precedent of deflating away debt by central banks when FC came along - but has that happened, no.

Scotland has no debt until the moment of indy itself and asks for it, thats the own currency argument right there for selling oil NS£.

321 2018-10-01 23:14:30 Idk who’s daughter needs to see this but go get an oil change
322 2018-10-01 23:13:59 I’ve noticed a HUUUGE increase in CBD oil shops here in Tennessee. They’re getting lots of business. So maybe: legalize weed? Cash crop!
323 2018-10-01 23:13:55 You couldn’t shine even if you took a bath in baby oil.  Nice try though!  #YouCantStealMyThunder
324 2018-10-01 23:13:53 My favorite meal in the world is spaghetti with asparagus, cherry tomatoes, spinach, garlic and Parmesan cheese all sautéed together in olive oil... Also steamed asparagus and a baked potato was a stable dinner my mom made growing up. Now I want some...
325 2018-10-01 23:13:38 I did a bunch of Life Shit today (doctor's appointment, car inspection/repair/oil change, picked up medication), and now I really really don't wanna write a reflection paper and do service documentation (oh my god there is never NOT service documentation to do...)
326 2018-10-01 23:13:29 I’m not against getting Canadian oil to the coast, but there is a big difference between LNG footprint and risks versus oil.
327 2018-10-01 23:13:27 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／
328 2018-10-01 23:13:23 Is this project viable at 100 dollar oil?

331 2018-10-01 23:12:40 Thank God for CBD oil. I would’ve had a heart attack by now from how much anxiety I endure on a daily basis.
332 2018-10-01 23:12:28 @RachelNotley just had your "keep Canada working" propaganda website show up on my beloved YouTube! Keep your filth out of our beautiful province of BC. You are a disgrace to the NDP party! Oil is dieing.. you should put your weak effort elsewhere. Cheers!
333 2018-10-01 23:12:26 Good luck! I have epilepsy and I'm interested in knowing about anyone using the oil who suffers with seizures. So far have just heard of treatment for children not adults. Interesting times ahead...and look forward to seeing more research with legalization

353 2018-10-01 23:07:46 Have you thought about MCT oil if you can’t do a Keto or even a low carb Paleo diet?
Did you watch the Dr Wahl video? I used to eat like that. It was easy. Now a lot of food I have eaten my whole life tastes rotten to me or the textures repulse me.

365 2018-10-01 23:06:33 Bloomberg Economics found that $100 oil will do more harm than good to global growth. Yet there are important differences in the condition of the world economy today compared with 2011.

381 2018-10-01 23:04:04 Your characterisation of the oil/gas is misleading:
1) industry acknowledged link to climate change relatively early(1990s).
2) oil/gas is not like a drug where the alternative is to stop using...unless you are willing to end our modern way of life and understandably few are.
382 2018-10-01 23:04:02 What??? Really? You sure you're not thinking of South Asians with the coconut oil?

384 2018-10-01 23:03:39 Well, nothing in this Twitter thread is going to impact what’s going on in the world outside. The solution is in doing. If you support solar, go put up some panels. If you support oil, go drill a well. If you support nuclear, go build a nuclear plant.

394 2018-10-01 23:02:25 Just make sure you get a higher quality cbd oil, read reviews, full spectrum works better and full MCT carrier oil works best. There is a lot of garbage oils out there bought from the same high volume manufacturers, do your research! Feel free to ask me anything

411 2018-10-01 22:59:45 Yes but furthering the point of everyone’s ignorance in terms of crushing the use of our own resources for environmental reasons so we can be even more dependent on imports. Our oil need isn’t going down and markets will simply get it elsewhere

They want people who speak power to truth, not truth to power.

469 2018-10-01 22:49:26 Obviously a trade agreement called USCAM would go down as well as Operation Iraqi Liberation (OIL) did. US-M-C Agreement (USMCA) appears to be a ranking of priority of interests to be met by the agreement US 1st, Mexico 2nd, Canada 3rd& last, reflecting Canada/Trudeau's lateness.

477 2018-10-01 22:48:59 good for you, so are the people who take handouts...

let's see, there are the farmers who are getting a subsidy due to trumps idiotic trade war

there are the oil companies who get 4 million a year

point being, you can pay tax and still get government money
478 2018-10-01 22:48:40 If you go by that chart adding short now is a good time. They’re starting to cover. You fading the swap dealers now?  $100 calls for oil after a big run up.

492 2018-10-01 22:46:24 Rockerfella made his fortune [Standard Oil]  in a time of least regulations in the oil industry. He has such a monopoly and used such unscrupulous tactics that regulations were put in place to curb these behaviors afterwards  and his company and others were broken up
493 2018-10-01 22:46:12 @EvanSolomonShow The new trade agreement would be better if the Dairy Cartel Mafia was Destroyed. Canadians have been paying 3 times the price for milk that we would be paying if the Supply Management was cancelled. Soros’ Attack on our oil sands needs to stop too.

* 1980s silence as big oil etc line their pockets
* 1990s ditto from 80s, launch Fox News & start spinning some fake news
513 2018-10-01 22:44:04 (17) URGENT NEED for controlling OIL RESERVES wherever they are. As that guarantee dollar "trust" and quantity requirements for trade.

575 2018-10-01 22:36:10 Anyway, to continue with this “stress/anxiety free month” I’m focusing in my oil paintings, reading and other stress free activities I really enjoy. So, I’m about to reveal my newest painting in this week or maybe on the weekend!

580 2018-10-01 22:35:40 They do with increased taxes, however there health care covers everything even prescriptions. Health care is 19% of our economy. According @SenSanders Univ HC should be 20% less or 15.8%. Like the Fram Oil commercials used to say you can pay me now of pay me more later
@TomPerez
581 2018-10-01 22:35:39 Robitussin, fish oil made you feel better fast , otherwise you couldn't go out and play

The Saudis crushed them w/$60 per barrel oil.
Feb, 2018...Russia crossed a "red line," w/Iran in Syria.
Mattis "reigned them in."
In 30 mins, 200+ dead mercs, out of 500.
585 2018-10-01 22:35:17 Depends if the oil is being added to the track right now?!

589 2018-10-01 22:34:50 Exactly! The biggest cuts were to social service programs so her oil and gas company donors could get their big ass tax cuts.

591 2018-10-01 22:34:22 It’s not bad but it comes with positives and negatives. Basically all siege including oil will ruin your day, but you’d be have better recovery and be tankier. Until you get vamp level 8 or something and can unlock the Passives, you’ll feel the negatives more. So it’s a trade off
592 2018-10-01 22:33:50 That is brilliant. You have to try sesame oil, too. Soooo gooood.

595 2018-10-01 22:33:32 Really not looking forward to this oil change 
596 2018-10-01 22:33:17 To counter the lawsuit all the oil companies have to is to refuse to deliver their products to New York. When they realize the are on them, their tune have change. Either that or the people will make a change.
597 2018-10-01 22:33:07 I can't wait until you use some pictures of Kim & Bonnie oil wrestling for the promos or the "teasers." As a proud lesbian I LOVE to see woman oil wrestling. I find it fascinating to see two CARTOON characters oil wrestling. I can't wait!!
598 2018-10-01 22:32:59 Well they did get the goods! Oil!
599 2018-10-01 22:32:54 I just use olive oil and then dip them in mayo, rice vinegar and sriracha

605 2018-10-01 22:32:20 Ban oil? Stop plastic. Stop the world destroying the sea our biggest resource. Fund water.

610 2018-10-01 22:31:59 @alpuzz Didn't do the oil of oregano, but the cinnamon tea has helped.
611 2018-10-01 22:31:58 Patience.  They will slam fang and rotate into oil.  Has to happen.

All certified already or in the process. 20 yrs ago US energy department stated that US oil reserve depletion drive to energy dependence, which meant OPEC would had upper hand in trade. This is bc

They're called graphic novels you simpleton.
623 2018-10-01 22:30:39 I’ll agree with you there. The two choices in 2016 were the bottom of the barrel. How the R’s allowed him to the top of the barrel pissed me off. But he’s not on to anything...except lowering our standing in the world. He’s nothing more than a snake oil salesman.
624 2018-10-01 22:30:39 Pullback to your bottom red line or below? Oil is definitely ready for a YCL type of correction.
625 2018-10-01 22:30:31 Maybe Bowles can’t turn water to wine but he’s turning water into oil. I think macc has built a bad roster in 2017 and a mediocre one on 2016 and this year. Bowles is coaching like a 2 win coach on a 6-7 win team.

641 2018-10-01 22:28:13 (14) military doctrines, trade control, resource geopolitics, foreign narrative explain together what is going on actually. Most importantly, US denizens begins 2 realize the difference between official storyteller and independent journalism. Venezuela has the biggest oil reserve

643 2018-10-01 22:28:05 Is it possible Chris killed the kids that weekend and dumped them in the oil tank before Shan' nan came home? Then she freakout when she realized the girls weren't there. Then killed Shan'nan.@TVAshleigh

645 2018-10-01 22:27:54 You mean Harper's idea of building trade with other countries instead? As in selling oil to a country that doesn't apply a MASSIVE discount? I'm sure Alberta is going to love this new deal...

649 2018-10-01 22:27:27 I suppose the GOP could have lowered themselves to the Democrat Party and opened hearings for Garland only to spew a bunch of lies about him being a gang rapist. Lampooning his 10-year old daughter in a major newspaper’s “cartoon” section. That would have been “a” way...

Did you know that recipe for oil goes back to deal sea scrolls?your be amazed..even three kings bringing frankincense and myrrh.those burnt in a oil burner wth oil heals too..
656 2018-10-01 22:26:05 Tory's Liz Truss describing Labour's Keynesian economics (as per the Scandinavian model)....  'Venezuelan style economics'. Is that the same Venezuela that was trashed by getting the Saudis to dump oil on the market to destabilise the price to $28 a barrel on top of US sanctions?
657 2018-10-01 22:25:52 If oil and water don’t mix.... being anointed and messy won’t either. #message
658 2018-10-01 22:25:51 Worse that uninformed. Trump himself misinformed his supporters. With the promise of tax breaks for the working class and good medical insurance.. He's only helping the elite, wealthy and is oil and Wallstreet buddies. He straight up lied. Also yes the David Dukes side with GOP
659 2018-10-01 22:25:37 Oil probably old and wanna change
660 2018-10-01 22:25:22 The #USMCA approval is just another blow to Venezuelan oil exports to the U.S. As it reduces imports Mexico and Canada now get to have more oil exports displacing further Venezuela.
661 2018-10-01 22:25:19 People are trying to tell me to do Castro oil

669 2018-10-01 22:24:20 @jakequery I dont like the feel of Lucas Oil Stadium. It feels like a big warehouse.  Energy is not there.

677 2018-10-01 22:23:09 great point, so basically my boss did a power brake while the truck was running  and I was behind the engine cause I had to check for boost leaks and transmission dipstick is messed up so the trans oil starts pouring all over me, while I’m checking, so boooom how’s it my fault?

694 2018-10-01 22:20:13 You know summer is officially over when the air is crisp, the scent of cinnamon wafts through the air and the coconut oil is no longer puro líquido.
695 2018-10-01 22:20:13 ...why??
696 2018-10-01 22:20:09 "Oil" is the favorite word of people building online dating profiles in the U.S. states of Texas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota.

701 2018-10-01 22:19:25 You seem to be very involved in roleplaying with yourself over there. Do you want us to leave you alone? We can draw the curtains and you can help yourself to the olive oil- for want of other things- as your marital aide.

712 2018-10-01 22:18:01 Canada won on oil.  Don’t have to sell per NAFTA deal
713 2018-10-01 22:18:01 I try with oil, but like, I can’t because we buy from other countries.
714 2018-10-01 22:17:59 99 เป็นกำลังใจให้ครับผม
715 2018-10-01 22:17:54 When was the last time you checked your oil levels? Do this weekly, more so if you travel long distances. Never let your car run dry.
716 2018-10-01 22:17:52 Tea trea oil makes my skin recover so fast it's crazy, I could feel 4/5 spots starting to fork on my forehead so I tabbed a bit of tea tree oil on and it stop them so now they're gone.
717 2018-10-01 22:17:49 まあそんな画力はないんですけどね、いつかはかいてみたい

719 2018-10-01 22:17:29 For over thinking you may want to try cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, that combined with CBD oil might help you better train your thought process
720 2018-10-01 22:17:04 WHAT?!?!? Jelly

Oh, I'm wicked at home made chips too; only way man!

729 2018-10-01 22:15:56 Do you support subsidies paid to the oil and gas industry?

731 2018-10-01 22:15:46 Isn't that just wonderful. We have to pay for it now, after Trudeau lied and said they would defend dairy at all costs. Hey Katie, why not ask where the payout is for the oil and gas sector in Alberta that Trudeau has effectively killed off?

732 2018-10-01 22:15:42 E dey for auction ..... you go buy?
733 2018-10-01 22:15:41 Haha!  More snake oil legal nonsense filed by resistance grifters to rake in donations.
734 2018-10-01 22:15:40 That's quite a surprise since 2015 oil glut. The US became net *OIL exporter in 2007, not to mention there is untapped reserves in Natural Gas. 

Energy Secretary Rick Perry predicted the US will become a net *ENERGY exporter in the next 18 months. Economists predict 2022.
735 2018-10-01 22:15:35 I couldn't wait for the numbing to completely wear off to eat. I'm getting my oil changed and there's a food truck across the street.
736 2018-10-01 22:15:29 Cut sprouts in quarters, 6 to 8 red potatoes cut in 1 inch pieces, drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper to taste, 425 12 mins, leek: cut in half lengthwise, and then cut into 1/4 inch half moon shapes, add to potato/sprout mixture and bake 10 to 15 more mins . Add peas. Yum!!
737 2018-10-01 22:15:14 Do hot oil treatment and deep condition it every 2nd week
738 2018-10-01 22:15:07 Conkers, conkers conkers, or peppermint spray or spearmint spray ( essential oil 4drops in 500ml spray bottle with water) spray on windows, cracks, doors, weekly or if it rains heavily, worked a bloody charm st uni
739 2018-10-01 22:15:01 Internet full of imformation. About cbd oil.but cbd u have to either put it in food or like @Littleb02871345 says put under your tongue. To help sleep smoke neat weed in pipe lol
740 2018-10-01 22:14:48 If there was any justice in this matter, it would be to make a law that anyone who owns tribal land can give it back to the tribe for free and get a market value dollar-for-dollar tax credit for doing so. Think of how the oil, realty & mining industries would fight it, though.
741 2018-10-01 22:14:48 Oven roast with a drizzle of olive oil and some Kosher salt, add some dried cranberries then, once done, drizzle with Balsamic dressing. I serve Brussels sprouts at least 1-2 times per week.
742 2018-10-01 22:14:42 How is this fair? I really can't afford another tax. I am still clawing my way back from 2015 when oil crashed and almost lost my business. I never got a plug nickel from any government.
743 2018-10-01 22:14:38 Black seed oil during the night and Argan oil shampoo to wash it out or regular shampoo. Buy a tangle teaser too, they prevent hair loss more than normal brushes which tend to be harsher
744 2018-10-01 22:14:36 Please don't tell me you're so spiritual that you are not of this world so you don't vote! Then stop using our gasoline, oil and eating our food!

751 2018-10-01 22:13:38 I thought for a moment they were talkin about foreign oil: “The USMCA agreement is opening the gate even further by letting foreign products, made according to standards inferior to our own...”
752 2018-10-01 22:13:33 In the amended version Fail Oil is much further down. See it on the creators Twitter

768 2018-10-01 22:11:56 1.5 lbs Brussel sprouts. Toss them in bowl w/ 4 Tbs olive oil, 1.5 Tbs Balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper. Spread on pan. Bake in 400° oven 30 min. Shake pan 1/2 way thru. Easy & tasty. Vegan guests will be happy there's no bacon--another fave of mine when cooking Brussel sprouts.

770 2018-10-01 22:11:46 They'll do cheap poppadoms. Get loads of them fraction of price of supermarkets. Just heat some oil and chuck them in individually for two seconds with metal prongs; job done! To test oil ready, snap tiny bit off and see if it turns white and goes to top quick then know if ready.
771 2018-10-01 22:11:40 とりあえずおっぱい、乳首を誇張

776 2018-10-01 22:11:11 Lot of this kind of masking goes on, for example vegetable oil covers for palm oil I remember once finding out.
777 2018-10-01 22:11:05 1 frozen bag of baby sprouts, coconut oil, garlic and onion powder. Bake until soft.

786 2018-10-01 22:09:59 I would be surprised if that was true. It is non stick. I know that cast iron pans need oil when out away as part of how to care for it, but not a nonstick pan.
787 2018-10-01 22:09:56 Tossed in olive oil, salt, pepper, roasted in the oven and topped with a mustard sauce.

802 2018-10-01 22:08:40 We hope you find relief from CBD oil! 
803 2018-10-01 22:08:38 @MBuhari pple are working really heard to see that they destroy the relationship belema community has with shell by sponsoring delta state women,nembe and bayelsa to suppress the people of belema community I repeat federal govt should call pandef sponsored by belema oil to oder.
804 2018-10-01 22:08:36 I hate to see the Iran sanctions bring back $4 gas. America has its own oil industry. We don’t need the goons of terrorism. If electric cars become cheaper the slot machines we call gas pumps can run dry

807 2018-10-01 22:08:23 I love splitting them in half and lightly searing with olive oil, kosher salt and finish with a glaze of maple syrup. THE BEST!
808 2018-10-01 22:08:16 will PREPA shake the Diesel costs? ... dont see that... will the Fuel Oil 6 get any cheaper? ...doesnt look like it short term.... will revenues Increase ?? with 2 cents rate hike? and The Popularity of Solar has really taken off on the Island... anyone that can is doing it...
809 2018-10-01 22:08:15 Is that a typo Ange? Did you mean CBD oil? 
810 2018-10-01 22:08:07 This depends on if the cbd oil you are using has a higher amount THC in it or not. It's important to make sure you know the specific ingredients in CBD oil you purchase!
811 2018-10-01 22:08:07 والله انك صادق يادكتور, كلامك بخصوص ارهاق الحقول حقيقه وسمعتها من الدكتور النعيم في الجامعه, وفي الاخير يقولك البترول  لن يرتفع وان (الصخري وجد ليبقي) المشكله الناس الفاهمه مثلك يادكتور مانشوفها في التلفاز تنشر الوعي ولها صيت وزوبعه في الاعلام
812 2018-10-01 22:08:07 Why is it that @SasolSA get to increase fuel  price? I thought their production doesn’t involve crude oil...
813 2018-10-01 22:08:01 If @Hartsy43 replaces Bundy, I might consider Comcast justified.  Any oil e else, no way.
814 2018-10-01 22:07:57 I’ve been waiting my whole life for this... if you’re just starting out I recommend Murray’s. That shit could hold the most unstable relationship together. After your waves are set it the pomade ain’t necessary. I use cold pressed avocado oil and curl enhancing smoothie

822 2018-10-01 22:07:22 Oatmeal flour (oats ran through a blender food processor) and tea tree oil, mixed into a paste, over night!
823 2018-10-01 22:07:08 The process of aging!  It absorbs oil from your skin, the air around you and the smoke in your area and turns it yellow! Its u fortunate because it is a great way to show off your phone’s color. However, this is the issue to many plastic cases.
824 2018-10-01 22:06:34 im gonna put my head into frying oil
825 2018-10-01 22:06:15 Roasted in coconut oil and bacon grease, with salt, pepper, and garlic and of course bacon chopped in bits.  Yum!
826 2018-10-01 22:06:10 Funny but the gutting of the Paris agreement by US oil lobbyists, the wars, financial crimes, Big Pharma, Big Sugar, Big Guns, Big Agro...all supported by Presidents that pontificated about the very opposite made me a nihilist a long time ago. Trump is just America on parade.
827 2018-10-01 22:06:02 Garlic olive oil and kosher salt & pepper. Roast them @425 for 25-30.

833 2018-10-01 22:05:29 Shred them on a mandolin slicer then saute in butter/olive oil with crushed garlic and bacon bits. Dried mustard, salt, pepper -- YUM. This is the ONLY recipe that received a thumbs up from sprouts haters. Older daughter and I love them any way :)

835 2018-10-01 22:05:23 A riff on Italian classic Piccata, cod.  Lightly floured after seasoning with pepper, garlic and paprika, fried in butter and olive oil and finished on a covered grill with lemon juice, spooning over the hot liquid until cooked through.  Served with curried lentils and greens.

845 2018-10-01 22:03:51 I like to roast them with just a little oil and salt and pepper and am so happy. They get a little sweeter as they roast like most vegetables.  I also like to add thin carrot slices.
846 2018-10-01 22:03:50 Charlottes web is not for getting high, it’s used a dietary supplement for the high CBD content, the same as CBD oil
847 2018-10-01 22:03:48 Went to the dentist, got my oil changed, got groceries, did laundry, cleaned the house, made dinner. Don’t grow up kids. It sucks.

854 2018-10-01 22:02:57 How Much CBD Oil Should I Take? To treat chronic pain: 2.5-20 mg CBD by mouth for an average of 25 days. To treat epilepsy: 200-300 mg of CBD by mouth daily. To treat movement problems associated with Huntington's disease: 10 mg per kilogram of CBD by mouth daily for six weeks.

858 2018-10-01 22:02:29 Dunno I was kidding. I think the oil prices depends on the number of traders offering oil trades in the commodities market more than cost or offer theory :D
859 2018-10-01 22:02:19 My question.Why do the deep pocket Oil companies not sic their legal depts on these fraudsters and slandering liars?#abpoli Take a page out of @Resource_Works  courageous tactics and fight back.
860 2018-10-01 22:02:17 It's not about oil.
861 2018-10-01 22:02:06 Roasted. Little olive oil and course salt. They get a nutty flavor when done that way.
862 2018-10-01 22:01:55 Knowing dinoland, the metallic part is probably flammable. Next oil fire.... boom

866 2018-10-01 22:01:21 You didn’t immediately disallow Harry Potter?
867 2018-10-01 22:01:10 I'm with you except I cut them in half, steam for about five minutes, then into the frying pan with olive or avocado oil.  Salt, pepper, and balsamic vinegar.  Delicious!
868 2018-10-01 22:01:02 I really enjoy oil painting, I think I will continue even after the class is done uwu
869 2018-10-01 22:00:58 Sautéed a golden brown in olive oil with generous sea salt.
870 2018-10-01 22:00:39 You are right that the fresher the oil the better but the only way to know this is if the harvest date is on the container. The BBE date is simply 2 years from bottling it gives no indication of the age of the oil prior to bottling #evoo
871 2018-10-01 22:00:37 And oregano oil
872 2018-10-01 22:00:35 So I was I apologize thought the oil?

875 2018-10-01 22:00:26 So I accidentally put my fish oil capsules in my tea and didn't realize it until I got to the bottom of the cup. 
876 2018-10-01 22:00:20 In my experience the more the market talks about the possibility of something happening the more likely it is to happen. The recent banter on whether oil will reach $100 by years end is a classic example. That's why I'm still long plenty of $STO at these levels.
877 2018-10-01 22:00:10 It's not wheat it's oil seed rape you know: oily, seedy and rapey.
Probably more appropriate that wheat
878 2018-10-01 22:00:08 The U.S is hurt more by Trump’s tarifffs on aluminum and steel. Americans pay the Trump tax every time they will buy a car, house, oil, washing machine or can of beer -  or any other good that uses aluminum or steel.
879 2018-10-01 22:00:02 It's no longer rat, my Sis. You need Olive Oil and Holy water

886 2018-10-01 21:59:46 Roasted with salt, pepper,
Olive oil!!  Sooo yummy!!
887 2018-10-01 21:59:39 $SPY put buyers dominate call buyers, $XHB new lows, $IWM drops 1.32%, $XLF weak, $EEM trending down.  But oil, $SPY, $QQQs at new highs. If it feels like nothing makes sense, it's because it doesn't. Not to me anyway.
888 2018-10-01 21:59:34 I think there needs to be a distinction made between addiction vs dependence. After a pt has been on meds for a while, running out of meds is like an engine w/an oil leak. Initially u think you're fine only to realize you're really not--in the most basic, yet horrifying ways.
889 2018-10-01 21:59:32 Looks like Canada got the best of Trump. Oil is way up. Taking all our money. NAFTA. The United States Mexico Canada Agreement, USMCA.

891 2018-10-01 21:59:18 @Nikki_Hats calls me
Me: grunts
Her: oh you’re oil pulling, I’ll call you back 

892 2018-10-01 21:59:13 これはつまづいて、そうなったからセーフ！
893 2018-10-01 21:58:51 One thing is evident. You either love them or hate them. No real in-between. I like them roasted like so many others mention - olive oil and favorite spice. Steamed is good with just a bit of sea salt and butter. Even had “au gratined” (new word?).
894 2018-10-01 21:58:37 More bearish news and will see how much oil goes up
895 2018-10-01 21:58:25 Roasted.  Salt, pepper, olive oil.  A winner every time.
896 2018-10-01 21:58:24 これは、故意ではないためセーフです！
897 2018-10-01 21:58:07 Oil is not for the weak
898 2018-10-01 21:58:07 Why didn’t anyone told me having a car is this expensive??? Que oil change, que inspection que no mamen
899 2018-10-01 21:57:55 Probably less than oil field workers though
900 2018-10-01 21:57:55 Prefer Goodyear tbh Gordon.. Michelin just promote being fat... I'm with Jaime Oliver on this one.. Just eat dust ...soaked in extra virgin oil of course
901 2018-10-01 21:57:43 If I break your heart na oil spillage 
902 2018-10-01 21:57:42 i believe he was born an oil man
903 2018-10-01 21:57:28 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
904 2018-10-01 21:57:28 #439, Spanish Proverb
Truth and oil always come to the surface.
905 2018-10-01 21:57:24 So I heard on NPR that your beloved oil companies can’t buy enough pipeline materials because of steel tariffs.  We gonna bail out oil companies *and farmers support the orange man and @GOP ?
906 2018-10-01 21:57:14 My apricot oil should be here today. I love coming home to packages 
907 2018-10-01 21:57:02 I’m trying to get off them.... it might also push us to use other forms of pain relief. If I didn’t have surgery coming up I’d go cold turkey & use / trial cbd oil.
908 2018-10-01 21:56:59 Quiero un cambio de look
909 2018-10-01 21:56:55 Wouldn’t it be nice if the Liberals were as concerned about the Oil & Gas Industry. So sad they have no problem losing $40 Million $$ a day.
910 2018-10-01 21:56:51 fellow shit skin ppl: change ur pillowcase every couple of days bc airbourne/physical bacteria, oil, and dirt build up !! u wouldn’t lay ur face on the ground after cleansing it so don’t leave ur pillowcase on too long
911 2018-10-01 21:56:48 #ScotiabankEconomics forecasts NL’s real GDP growth will slow to 0.5% in 2018 and 1.2% in 2019. Falling business investment and household spending are key sources of weakness, but oil production from the Hebron oil field supports export growth this year and next. #CdnEcon
912 2018-10-01 21:56:43 And coconut oil!!! I just tweeted about this actually lol
913 2018-10-01 21:56:41 Same...i add olive oil & scotch bonnet peppers or calypso sauce. But I’m getting old & I can’t take the spicy like I used to
914 2018-10-01 21:56:28 Who will pay them to protest conflict oil?
915 2018-10-01 21:56:18 Roasted w/ olive oil, s & p. Simple is better where Brussels sprouts are concerned.
916 2018-10-01 21:56:13 I’ve lost my lavender essential oil, how can it be ;_;
917 2018-10-01 21:55:34 Via @RAN "PepsiCo has just announced that it will STOP sourcing — both directly and indirectly — from Conflict Palm Oil producer Indofood." Cool news with a big impact. Hope trends will continue in this direction, for the orangutans & the rest of us.

919 2018-10-01 21:55:15 When does the oil and gas sector get a payout?
#notmycanada
920 2018-10-01 21:55:07 When you’re doing #abhyanga, it’s easy to get oil everywhere! To keep things contained, set aside a special towel to sit or stand on during your morning massage. Keep a few paper towels handy, so you can wipe off any excess oil before hopping in the shower or touching the faucet!
921 2018-10-01 21:55:06 See you are a truck driver. 
Often wondered why companies dont recruit more in inner cities. People say they cant get out. No better way I know of to get out at 0 cost. See country, opportunities open up along the way you never knew about living in the bubble
922 2018-10-01 21:55:01 My daughter in-law roasts them in the oven with olive oil, salt and pepper. I do that, too. Somehow hers turn out better than mine. Sooo good. She also changed my opinion of sweet potatoes. For the better.
923 2018-10-01 21:54:54 @legend_217 icosapent ethyl is to fish oil as jet fuel is to crude oil. Anyway, yes, but sales will go up, too. Note $AMZN has $8.8B debt
924 2018-10-01 21:54:46 @timothysykes Tm, I use topically applied CBD oil for aches and pains. Forget Blue Emu, forget Ben Gay, now that I think of it ,those guys will probably incorporate CBD oil into their products in the end.
925 2018-10-01 21:54:44 Urban legend says if you say tea 3x while facing the mirror@3am you will summon the tea3sisters and they will give you a bottle of oil for shits and giggles.
926 2018-10-01 21:54:40 But of course Trump will blame the Fed, NOT his tariffs. Soon he will start saying the oil markets are "rigged".
927 2018-10-01 21:54:39 I work in Sugarland, Texas.   I have an aesthetic business and I am very blessed and busy. My husband is also busy as a  project manager for shutdowns. He was on North slope in Alaska for about 9 mths, there is a huge new oil find!  Exciting times!
928 2018-10-01 21:54:30 Sliced in half, skewered, brushed w/ olive oil, dusted w/ cayenne + garlic, then GRILLED!

931 2018-10-01 21:54:15 Slice in half. Stir with olive oil, salt, pepper, paprika and parmesan cheese to your personal taste. Roast on a baking sheet with high heat. (425+)
932 2018-10-01 21:54:07 We love roasting them, with simply olive oil, salt & pepper. I've added bacon for special occasions.
933 2018-10-01 21:54:06 Will House of Saud cancelling aramco ipo along w/shuttling $200b SoftBank play (and OPEC agreement, Iranian sanctions, oil looking at $100) affect Volvo, Uber, MbS's NEOM, race to level 5 AV? If so, + or - effect on 5 year $4000 ARK price target for Tesla? @TashaARK
934 2018-10-01 21:53:59 Even our trusted #1 allies-the European Union, is now incentivized 2B less close 2 USA, due 2 Chump! Hes criticized em as lazy &needy 4 R NATO military support, his trade approach is every man 4 himself, 2 bow down 2 USA, &Saudi Arabia holds most of the oil cards-using the dollar
935 2018-10-01 21:53:40 The oil industry complex is probably not very happy about this.
936 2018-10-01 21:53:38 Love roasting with sweet potatoes and butternut squash w/ a little olive oil and garlic salt.
937 2018-10-01 21:53:37 Shredded and sautéed in olive oil. Top with pignoli.
938 2018-10-01 21:53:35 Tax cut for who? Largest oil producer yet high prices for gas and heating oil
939 2018-10-01 21:53:33 Yes, they are both sensitive to price if oil but in opposite directions while hopefully, both paying around 5% divi and large cap for lower volatility.
940 2018-10-01 21:53:29 Split in half and roasted in a hot oven with olive oil, salt and pepper and then a squirt of lemon juice when they’re done. Even my veggie hating husband will eat them this way!
941 2018-10-01 21:53:22 And I feel like they didn't do Driver justice. The main reason people watch SNL is to see the guests have fun and act silly on stage. So they should have used him more than like 5 seconds in each skit. The oil barren skit wasn't my fav, but Driver handled it like a pro.
942 2018-10-01 21:53:19 I half them, then coat them in olive oil, salt, & pepper & roast them.  Simple, but so good.
943 2018-10-01 21:53:17 an oil tanker for you
944 2018-10-01 21:53:17 At one point I remember a barrel of oil was in the $70 range and gas was .70 cents a liter. What happened? A barrel of oil today is $75.47 and gas is $1.25 a liter. There is something wrong here. This is not INFLATION!
945 2018-10-01 21:53:01 Curfews and programme scheduling go out the window when epic sporting excitement is ongoing. Anyone remember Dennis Taylor and Steve Davis burning the midnight oil. Thank You BT Sport #speedway #excitement
946 2018-10-01 21:52:59 Steam them just a few minutes. Tre cut in half. Toss in olive oil and roast for about 20 minutes at 425. You can also wrap in bacon.
947 2018-10-01 21:52:58 Slice ‘em in half, glaze w/ olive oil, season with garlic salt and sea salt, and bake on a baking stone.
948 2018-10-01 21:52:40 I will never understand what people find palatable about Chippies banana chips. Can’t you all taste the stale oil?
949 2018-10-01 21:52:37 Roast with olive oil, balsamic
Vinegar, salt and pepper
950 2018-10-01 21:52:37 Data is the new oil and we are the dead dinosaur bodies.
951 2018-10-01 21:52:33 I don't know but have you considered trying Cobaiba essential oil. It works in a similar way but is a lot less expensive.
952 2018-10-01 21:52:29  The next phase of this TT Government is for gas and diesel prices to no longer be subject to government control, fully liberalising pricing, allowing it to fluctuate by shifts based on factors such as international fuel prices, price of crude oil and our exchange rates.
953 2018-10-01 21:52:27 It might be the CBD oil (taking for inflammation issues) but instead of feeling annoyed by people who usually annoy me, I just feel an odd sense of pity and sadness.
954 2018-10-01 21:52:24 Where's the pay out for the oil and gas sector that Trudeau has effectively killed?
955 2018-10-01 21:52:06 The only reason US-President Nixon created The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is because an oil spill occurred off the coast of California where he had a private villa.

969 2018-10-01 21:50:12 58 years back, we are farming with a Hoe.. and yet still farming with a Hoe.

58 years back, we depend on crude oil as sole source of income.. & yet we still depend on crude oil.

58 years back, we are not industrialized.. & yet still not industrialized 

What are we celebrating?

984 2018-10-01 21:48:59 Fair comment. However like I’ve said they’re not oil merchants, would you like us to do a Leeds, take a risk, enjoy it for a few years “better on red/black” with Champs League £ with risk of coming up short & going under?

987 2018-10-01 21:48:46 did you add oil to the joints?

989 2018-10-01 21:48:35 And UKOG would sell their oil cheaper to the UK.....get real !!
990 2018-10-01 21:48:29 Gold diggers dig until they find oil

992 2018-10-01 21:47:58 Iran and Saudi relatively same in stock with the exception of Iraqi oil fields. High oil prices are a result of low oil supply in the market.
993 2018-10-01 21:47:54 According to info from our local recycling company, such material (usually plastic) is incinerated as it is basically the same as burning oil. The energy produced is then used in different ways, depending on the company running the incinerator.
994 2018-10-01 21:47:40 One thing that annoys me about #Witcher3 is you spend ages trying to beat a certain monster cause you don’t know the spell for the right oil or bomb or you can’t find the ingredients, and the second you beat that bitch the next thing you loot has the bloody stuff

1004 2018-10-01 21:46:19 The price of crude oil went up by about $3 .

The is getting interesting, I hope they don't increase fuel prices. Fingers crossed

1017 2018-10-01 21:45:00 Carter stood up to big oil, the industrial military complex and money in politics.   Strikes one, two, three and the media destroyed him.
After all - who profits from the money in politics?
1018 2018-10-01 21:44:58 Life Hack. Turmeric is a spice that helps with pain/inflammation AND that's best absorbed by the body when carried on healthy fat. Next time your peanut butter requires you to stir a bunch of oil into it, first add some turmeric. PB masks the flavor! Tastes like tangy PB! :) YW!

1043 2018-10-01 21:42:50 Monday close: corn +9.5Z, beans +9.75X=same cents increase tells the difference in S:U. Wheat +1.75Z-SRW, meal +4.5Z, hogs +1.825Z, cattle +0.25Z. Crude oil rocketed +2.22X. US$ idx +0.16 to 95.30. Dow stocks +192. The trade liked US/Canada news. But is it really a big deal?
1044 2018-10-01 21:42:42 I like a foot-long Italian sub with spicy Capicola but no cheese (lactose), red wine vinegar but no oil, shredded Iceberg lettuce and lots of those little cube pickles. Oh, don't forget salt, pepper and Italian herbs.

1050 2018-10-01 21:41:58 It was reported today on Fox News that Exxon Mobil declares that the U.S. is the # 1 EXPORTER of oil in the world now......If that's the case, why on God's green earth is OUR gas so high? I"m still not used to $3.00 a gallon. They want you to get used to it though. Sad.

1052 2018-10-01 21:41:51 At their peak the oil sands accounted for about 2% of our GDP. Jobs in clean tech have already passed those in fossil fuels. Future growth lies elsewhere.

Separate the leaves from the stems of the parsley. Finley chop stems, course chop leaves
1091 2018-10-01 21:37:34 Well, you anonymous political troll, the oil sands replaces almost zero domestic supply. Even with TMX, we'd still be importing from those countries almost the same amount we do now.
Us "envionmentalists" have a goal of reducing FF use across the board
1092 2018-10-01 21:37:22 Let’s see steel industry, small business, auto industry, oil and gas. By the way most economist agree Obama doubled the debt. Where were you when the Dems pushed Obamacare down our throat. How much debt did that create. A lot more than Trumps tax cut
1093 2018-10-01 21:37:10 You could all just eat healthy instead. Homegrown beetroot greens, chives, tomatoes on olive oil drizzled toast. Or porridge with fruit.

1117 2018-10-01 21:34:41 By your crazy logic a future war with Iran is already ok because their  oil will power your future car that wouldnt otherwise run. Or at least  you expect pacifists to just not drive after we steal a country's oil.
1118 2018-10-01 21:34:30 @MelGNaturopath Hello  I was wondering where I can purchase the CBD Oil you use personally. The one you were using in the YouTube video I guess. Thanks for any information! I’m interested in trying it for chronic pain.
1119 2018-10-01 21:34:17 Tell us how the IGR is generated since this IGR is not coming from taxes paid by oil companies & all the industries/businesses owned by the SS & SE business men in Lagos, ofcourse other tribes too. Don't talk trash all Nigerians leaving in Lagos contribute to the robust Lagos IGR
1120 2018-10-01 21:34:13 Anibal qué pasó con oil? Ahora les van a sacar todos los medios. Y tu defendido no sale más. Saludos.
1121 2018-10-01 21:34:13 That's how it's sold, anyway. It's also a matter of cultures that mix about as well as oil and water. I don't see many middle-east nations opening their doors. Why must the west?

And how many 'refugess' has China taken in, by the way?
1122 2018-10-01 21:34:09 Global warming is to blame for everything it seems except global cooling. If lady birthed a snake in Indonesia that snake oil salesman Al Gore would blame it on non existent warming. I would blame it on insanity. Need proof of birth from 97% of snake birth scientists.
1123 2018-10-01 21:34:03 Palm oil, timber and soy being 3 of the main 4. Any data on what proportions these are in? Genuinely curious. Would be interesting to know.
1124 2018-10-01 21:33:51 The window is never closing. Peak oil at 2040 then slow decline. 2B vehicles by then on the world’s road and only 15% electric by then.
1125 2018-10-01 21:33:49 Big day for #Canada, energy markets & environment. #LNG Canada moving forward...a travesty that this wasn't started 5yrs ago. Forget QE/tax cuts, greatest stimulus past 2 decades was falling gas prices breaking through fuel oil ('07) then coal ('11); now the global base energy
1126 2018-10-01 21:33:47 Surely Whale Oil is too high on quality here.
1127 2018-10-01 21:33:44 They always tell me my face/nails are dry too but it’s true- I don’t drink enough water  salon quality shampoo is awesome but I’m okay with a drug store deep conditioner or Amla oil applied to my ends 
1128 2018-10-01 21:33:37 草
1129 2018-10-01 21:33:34 Probably because even with weaker environmental standards, most oil in the world is still cleaner and cheaper to extract than oil from the oil sands.
1130 2018-10-01 21:33:34 I can smell snake oil 50 m away now.
1131 2018-10-01 21:33:23 Trump rescinded Obama admin rule change to implement these air brakes, last week. Public safety is at risk, environment, too. Seems like a political concession to Big Oil at the expense of public & environmental safety as well as jobs.
1132 2018-10-01 21:33:02 roads are slickest when rain has just started and hasn't had time to blockchain away the oil
1133 2018-10-01 21:33:02 Something tells me he bypassed the Federalist Papers and settled for a subscription to Mother Jones.
1134 2018-10-01 21:33:00 It prepared them to be shocked, upset, and deeply offended by real life. 

And therefore unhappy ... and prey to any snake oil salesmen who can promise them happiness.

1137 2018-10-01 21:32:33 Very difficult watch especially when you work in the oil industry. Torn between trying to do the right thing and providing for your family. I will certainly do my bit from now on to help future generations where I can.

1139 2018-10-01 21:32:28 @TheRickWilson How about air brakes on oil trains, Senator? Two corporations in Iowa have been hard at work on this important major safety & environmental hazard enhancement for trains carrying highly flammable oil & petroleum products, since 2015.
1140 2018-10-01 21:32:27 Took my car in to get an oil change, went back to the dealership to pick it up after they called me and said it was done. 

Been sitting here for 45 minutes because my car isn’t actually here.  They took it out for a complimentary car wash afterward. During a rainstorm. 
1141 2018-10-01 21:32:25 おはようございます(*^^*)
1142 2018-10-01 21:32:09 Love mine. Requires more retraining than most ergo boards, but worth it. Don’t remove the poly finish (To say, do an oil finish) as the wood isn’t well cured and will warp.
1143 2018-10-01 21:31:57 The pelagic fleet would hunt down the last fucking fish in the North Sea if they were allowed. If you see someone driving a Bentley in the North East it's not an oil executive it's a big fishing boat owner.

1152 2018-10-01 21:31:16 I like to bake my own rolls; 350ml of warm water, a couple of teaspoons of oil, a bit of salt, a bit of sugar and yeast for 20 mins, add in 500g of flour and make the dough. Then put into balls on a greased tray and leave for hours. Then bake.

Naans are the next step...
1153 2018-10-01 21:31:16 Yeah, agreed. I want to figure out  muffin that is all natural ie coconut flour, coconut oil, almond flour, what else? I may have to look up some recipes.

1157 2018-10-01 21:30:43 Norway is right to be proud of EV policy and renewables, but it doesn't make up for the net negative effect of opening new oil fields which will still be in production decades from now, and shockingly little progress on domestic emission reductions
1158 2018-10-01 21:30:42 Elena put an essential oil on my wrist for anxiety and gave me some sort of seeds to eat that are supposed to be good for your stomach and something else I can’t remember but they taste like minty soap lmao. I think I’m her replacement daughter until she goes home lmao.

1171 2018-10-01 21:29:25 they have successfully bought the oil and mineral rights of many areas in Somalia with even lesser amounts than $50 million. 

Why should they pay more while all our politicians and the people are whoring themselves for peanuts.

1175 2018-10-01 21:28:43 My intolerance won't kill me but it seriously impedes my life. I can't tolerate rapeseed oil, a common ingredient. It's really hard to identify, I know others share this but may not know it. We need to know ALL ingredients everywhere.
1176 2018-10-01 21:28:40 brent oil price at 84$, quite logical, where and when will it stabilize ?

1181 2018-10-01 21:27:45 What Russian oligarchs do cannot be attributed to Putin or Russia.
These people are not welcome in their own country because they have asset stripped & scarpered to London safe haven for crooks.
Russia needs STRONG European countries (not the EU) to continue buying oil & gas.

1198 2018-10-01 21:25:31 The question should be asked, will they be as accommodating, tolerant and generous towards natives when they become a majority or achieve power as a majority minority in European countries.  Indications are they will not be.
1199 2018-10-01 21:25:29 I make the turmeric one and the other one is from lush.

1208 2018-10-01 21:25:01 I didn’t even know until I had eaten half. I read the menu for the burgers and just assumed chips are chips I’ve never thought about the oil they are cooked in.

1210 2018-10-01 21:24:28 Well recall not for a country that does not export our dollar should be a lot weaker. One of the key reasons it isn't is because people see it as a stable currency and trade Commodities through it. One of the first things China did was ti start trading oil futures in Yuan
1211 2018-10-01 21:24:27 Oil it, it Kent knock.
1212 2018-10-01 21:24:22 Not quite,still gotta solve the whole 90% of all govt revenue from oil though
1213 2018-10-01 21:24:12 Oil is not the only reason for U.S. aggression.  Free Venezuela, like Cuba, would be an inspirational example of a state that uses its resources to benefit its people instead of multinational oligarchs.  International bankster cartel can't allow that.

1226 2018-10-01 21:22:30 my concern, curiosity becomes then, in a pure un-regulated market, what is the check on private business to curtail its consumption of resources sustainably, until the last oil is extracted, buffalo hunted, etc? Will ephemeralization be enough- technology swift and accessible?

Because the only thing I am reading there is red oil. Is it for rice abi???
1230 2018-10-01 21:22:08 Now where all that Money went? ..your guess is as good as mine. But it has to be paid.. oil sellres are not going to say oh ee understand you elected crooks.. forget the pending bill lets hug and start anew.. right?
1231 2018-10-01 21:22:07 Any #psoriasis sufferer's tried coconut oil on their scalp/ skin before? Would like to know if it works for others?
1232 2018-10-01 21:21:54 I am definitely tempted because of what I’ve seen and heard.

I just need a little more variety from my main flower producer since I need to use it all day every day.

That may change when I switch my oil supplier and I finally find an oil product I can use in the daytime.
1233 2018-10-01 21:21:53 And Trump is fully aware of Trudeau, Butts and current Liberal parties support of expansion in our oil industry is Luke warm at best.
1234 2018-10-01 21:21:48 Was having a bad day.. then my daddy came to my job and took my car to get an oil change and told me my insurance went from $200 to $125 
1235 2018-10-01 21:21:35 Might as well have your direct deposit go directly to the oil companies
1236 2018-10-01 21:21:05 If cod makes a lot of money off black ops 4, which they surely will, we are going to start seeing some big changes. Disney is looking at making money, and the snake oil is failing. The mouse is getting mad
1237 2018-10-01 21:21:02 100% he is. The reason I thought it might be something is Braun kind of looked a tad perplexed himself when he popped up after being tagged out.
1238 2018-10-01 21:20:56 I've also been known to roast a whole tray of garlic in oil in the oven and then puree some of it right into the soup

1241 2018-10-01 21:20:32 ...We eat "olive oil, avocado, nuts/seeds". 

LC & LF camps actually agree on many things!!! It would be less confusing to the public if we all focus on the common ground of what actual foods to eat/avoid for health. 2/2
1242 2018-10-01 21:20:20 The amount of plastic it the sea annoys me but it could be managed better. We don't create more carbon we just process it from the planet so we can undo what we do. Maybe we should tax the oil companies who take the natural resource with no plan for disposal. #DrowningInPlastic

1251 2018-10-01 21:19:20 The Middle East needs to sort out the Middle East. The oil and defense contractors making billions off American treasure, our children, isn’t worth it. America not valuing its promise to Vets is a scar that will torment all.

1258 2018-10-01 21:18:21 ....must be from lack of knowledge.
1259 2018-10-01 21:18:20 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for probiotic vodka, and put some cacao essential oil in my diffuser.
1260 2018-10-01 21:18:19 used coconut oil as well and it worked for both my pregnancies. I was lucky because big sis advised me to start applying the oil GENEROUSLY right from when the baby bump started showing till a few months after delivery. It keeps the skin elastic so it can rebound like rubber
1261 2018-10-01 21:17:57 RBG passes out on national TV. 
1262 2018-10-01 21:17:51 Witchy tip: Add 1 tsp of sea salt to your bucket of water before you mop the floors in your home. Also can add 10 drops of eucalyptus oil or lime juice.
1263 2018-10-01 21:17:49 Bro my anger is in flames everytime I gotta throw a Benji for some refined cooking oil
1264 2018-10-01 21:17:44 Reports that dollar is rebounding in #Iran and getting cheaper against the toman. People lining up at exchanges across the country to sell their dollars.

This occurs amid rising oil prices and news of “special vehicle” b/w Iran & Europe to facilitate trade & Iranian oil imports.
1265 2018-10-01 21:17:41 Everybody knows you’re supposed to have oil in your vehicle right? And if it’s smoking, you probably need MORE oil in your vehicle?
1266 2018-10-01 21:17:37 Just means more demand for American oil( and jobs)....we will fill the supply shortfall very quickly and the $$$$ stay in the US.
1267 2018-10-01 21:17:31 ‘We’ are very skilled, whomsoever we are.  New skills to replace fishing, farming, producing oil and making jam. Jute and Journalism appear to be passe

1270 2018-10-01 21:17:18 The market had a great response, but oil is only going up. It seems that OPEC is on their own agenda. 
If you put off the sanctions against Iran until mid January the price of oil would drop immediately, and you are showing Iran that you would put trust into relationship

1275 2018-10-01 21:16:41 I did research re CBD oil, but my pain Dr knows I can't afford so she has been trying other covered options first. It is sad when we have to choose Food & housing or treatment because treatment IS that expensive.
1276 2018-10-01 21:16:24 Who is Chris Evans? I am a 69 yo white Grannie and I know who Kanye West is. I honestly have NO clue who Chris Evans is nor do I care.
1277 2018-10-01 21:16:03 For govt to fund this, as opposed to funding bombing oil rich countries in the Middle East, it wouldn't ensure any financial advantage to them. And even worse it would shine a spotlight on the effects of Tory money grubbing asset stripping on the general populace. So kept shtum.
1278 2018-10-01 21:16:00 Mood: sitting in a Valvoline, reading about how to change my own oil
1279 2018-10-01 21:16:00 1. THANK YOU!! 
2. To be on the safe side take unopened disposable pens like alpine that don’t smell like it, are oil based, and have zero smell of weed in a self contained pen.
1280 2018-10-01 21:15:58 I've never seen a troupe as aggressively incompetent as Walmart's auto department. Waiting to put my name in for an oil change and I sat there for 20+ min while a lummox set off the alarm of the car ahead of me 3x as 4 other employees stood around ignoring me.

Bugger Walmart.
1281 2018-10-01 21:15:57 Why don't you ask @DrBirute herself? Dedicating her life to this cause and battling against palm oil destroying the primary forest.
1282 2018-10-01 21:15:47 when the candleholder is an oil basepod that gases out tothe flames safe and lotsoflight brilliant engineering
1283 2018-10-01 21:15:34 Project oil price at USD 60.00 per bbl and a production of 40,000 bopd. With increase drilling and production I would project 20% to 30% increase production per annum with well declining rates. First year increment 50000 bopd , revenue =1.08 billion USD/ annum! - Opex =Net Income

1285 2018-10-01 21:15:11 Peppermint oil is used in hoodoo to clear up blocked avenues, spiritual or literal gunk. It’s properties are soothing, opening, restoring and gently eases the blockages out of the way.

1288 2018-10-01 21:14:49 Slight updates for the Oil and Gas Industry. Just a little something for Big Business.
1289 2018-10-01 21:14:45 @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo South Sudan: with huge oil , gold, and other resources and the land to be the organic breadbasket of the world, China is moving in on South Sudan like a tiger- it is still possible to make a deal with Salva Kiir.  Don’t feed South Sudan to the tiger!!
1290 2018-10-01 21:14:42 Citigroup Inc. has a warning for U.S. oil investors: American crude prices may tumble to the steepest discount against global benchmark Brent since 2013.
1291 2018-10-01 21:14:42 Snake oil salesmen considered themselves showmen too. Doesn't mean I agree with them.
1292 2018-10-01 21:14:40 Baez too good for that. Weird
1293 2018-10-01 21:14:28 ZB should be down there right next to whale oil.
1294 2018-10-01 21:14:08 They are that uninformed.  I'll say that instead of saying that they are that stupid.
1295 2018-10-01 21:14:05 Data is the new Oil
1296 2018-10-01 21:14:02 So I went to my fiancé’s work at a dealership so he could give me an oil change and one of the managers heard him talking to me and yelled out “who is that Artie is talking to?!?? You must be his fiancée I can hear it in his voice” 
Oh he in LOVE love
1297 2018-10-01 21:14:01 “what perfume do you use????” ...i use orange essential oil n that’s all. i put it in my hair. that’s my secret y’all r welcome
1298 2018-10-01 21:13:44 Yeah, 0w20 is the only oil you should use if it calls for it. Otherwise it'll fuck up the car in the long run. I know your pain ;-;
1299 2018-10-01 21:13:33 I wouldn't tell you boko haram has no single territory in Nigeria, wouldn't tell you our foreign reserves is at the highest even at the lowest time of oil sales
1300 2018-10-01 21:13:33 Not impressed, seen million mile toyota all the time on the oil field
1301 2018-10-01 21:13:30 Posh is coming out with CBD oil.

1310 2018-10-01 21:12:17 Definitely using my auntie jackie's oil in Antigua cuz the air is so dry.. this Afro will not prosper 
1311 2018-10-01 21:12:08 They look at me weird when I order giardiniera oil only at the St. Louis locations… but in Central Illinois they had a bottle of it.
1312 2018-10-01 21:11:56 Oh my goodness #DrowningInPlastic Governments and manufacturers take heed! There is a solution; refillables. Pens and make up compacts etc could all be refilled and other items can be replaced. Plastic made from oil, clear undelying issues to do with money and greed to solve too
1313 2018-10-01 21:11:13 I get people complaining everyday all the time about how expensive our oil changes at work are ;-;
1314 2018-10-01 21:11:11 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
1315 2018-10-01 21:11:09 “Pardon me. That is the best. Secretary Clinton. You will never meet with them, they were afraid. We didn’t take the oil. American life.

1317 2018-10-01 21:10:43 To clarify, oil wasn’t the cause. It was one of many causes. The economics of war are very complex and several causes present a lot of motivation, a lot of economic motivations.
1318 2018-10-01 21:10:30 Ça peut-être due à la configuration du marché elle même. Exemple avec d'anciens trusts comme "standard oil"

1323 2018-10-01 21:09:57 Here we go again the fleecing of America. Hurry up electric cars. Big Oil has screwed the American People for way toooooooooo long.
1324 2018-10-01 21:09:50 We don't think that's the problem, do you know the kind of tourism resources we have in Nigeria? The fishing industry, does it exist? When we have poisoned the fishes all in a bid to get all the oil out at once. What drives all this? Not corruption?
1325 2018-10-01 21:09:27 Having to spend a few nights in hospital after having a major op , my hands and lips dried right out so I ask mum to bring my @Zoella lip oil in and hand cream , now iv run out of lip oil  , can’t even get to a super drug to buy more as on bed rest  #2weekrecovery

1327 2018-10-01 21:09:16 I feel like if you want a more warm, relaxing feeling overall candles are a better choice (except for lavender oils) but overall I feel like oils are more of a refreshing feeling. Especially since I use a Breathe Easy oil in my living room. Depends on the oils I guess lol

1330 2018-10-01 21:09:04 A hot bath with essential oils in it. I love putting in epsom salt, coconut oil, and some lavender. Light a candle and drink some wine, probs toke some too
1331 2018-10-01 21:08:48 I love chickpea flour and have made amazing zucchini bread with it and coconut sugar and olive oil. it's grain-free, tho it's a legume and technically not paleo or W30 compliant. I use it 1:1. thoughts?

1336 2018-10-01 21:07:59 Trump doesn't enough credit for being a willy snake oil salesman. One of his talents is defining his opponents. He does it by calling them names and identifying them as the enemy. He induces the audience to look for partisanship and prejudice. They see what they are looking for.
1337 2018-10-01 21:07:44 Bette,
Roy Cohn, a truly evil person, was Trump’s mentor. He lives on in Trump. What is wrong with Americans? They believe everything a 2-bit “celebrity” like Trump says! A snake oil salesman! There is no common sense!
1338 2018-10-01 21:07:43 I've stopped buying Nutella since I realised it contains palm oil. I buy Gu Chocolate & Hazelnut Spread now. Tasty.
1339 2018-10-01 21:07:37 $90 for an oil change...
I need to get a cheaper car.

1342 2018-10-01 21:07:14 Remind me again, what does Switzerland have resource wise, all the Scandinavian countries what do they have? 

Sadly what you call resources is oil right? Do you know that our human resources is worth more than that of many countries you call rich, so we're not poor resource wise

1345 2018-10-01 21:06:57 We had it at ISU… Wreck on Wheat with everything on it.  No hot peppers… but giardiniera oil and extra pickle.
1346 2018-10-01 21:06:47 Congress is no longer listening to us in the cannabis movement in fact they are now plotting and planning in southern states to take over the cannabis CBD oil industry. Time to end the madness that is cannabis prohibition and remove it from the Controlled Substances Act.
1347 2018-10-01 21:06:46 No one tell them about oil. I dont know if they could handle it

1351 2018-10-01 21:06:08 We almost faced one in 2016. If oil price had stayed low and the Naira crash had continued ( I believe it topped out at N520/$1), we would have been in a very different place now.
1352 2018-10-01 21:05:55 I have a sneaking suspicion that if there were allegations of sexual assault against Garland we would have heard about it ... come on.
1353 2018-10-01 21:05:51 I got an oil change today. It’s been a while since the last one. Is it weird that I can feel the difference in how smooth my car drives?

1371 2018-10-01 21:03:03 At risk of stating the obvious, the risk of a verbal intervention in the #oil market (particularly by the U.S.) has increased notably after today's rally has pushed Brent above $85 a barrel and WTI above $75 a barrel. #OOTT

1380 2018-10-01 21:01:54 More and more each day. Especially today as one of the mechanics where I take my car attempted to mansplain how the warranty on my new car works, when all I asked was to look up the maintenance prompt so if it's 4 the 1st oil change, I can take it to them, not the dealer.
1381 2018-10-01 21:01:51 Hahaha idk probably it's just the EXO's effect 
Omg yeah! THAT! Your intellectual brain told everything! I'm pretty sure any of us weren't expecting anything like this today.. EXO is so unexpected :c I'm crying happiness and motorbike oil 
1382 2018-10-01 21:01:43 Yeah because oil prices are low its cheeper to make new plastic compared to recycling, so if we had a gov who cared we'd tax the sh*t out of new plastic and tax breaks for recycled.

1419 2018-10-01 20:58:08 Where did the $40 discount of oil per barrel fall in the negotiation?  That would have been the starting point if I lead the charge....

1428 2018-10-01 20:56:52 do we all remember the Panic of our MPs when the Scottish vote was in favour of Leave the Union and the RBS bank and oil price and the economy being based on it .
Tory /Labour vested interests not ours or Scotlands
Brexit is the same , we did not vote they way they intended
1429 2018-10-01 20:56:41 I just fixed a squeaky chair with olive oil because I don't have WD40 and then after I was done realized I could have used gun oil instead
1430 2018-10-01 20:56:40 While Biafra will have many natural resources including oil, I do not envision Biafra as a petro-state. In fact, Biafra must enact environmental laws that make exploit of resources relatively expensive for petroleum companies compared to other African countries.
1431 2018-10-01 20:56:37 Managing salt associated with oil and gas production is a huge issue. Disposal wells seem to be the answer here in North America but I'm not sure we monitor the impacts of those well enough to say for sure. Also a big deal for oil sands...
1432 2018-10-01 20:56:23 Hi hope you are well. I successfully run a business named Golden Oil Stretch Marks Massage Therapy. This treatment defies science. I would love an opportunity to prove science wrong. When can I provide my service? I would love to do a collaboration with. Thank you

1434 2018-10-01 20:56:11 Iraq had nothing to do with terrorism in V.1 and V.2. V.1 was about Kuwait’s oil and V.2 about Kuwait’s AND Iraq’s oil. Remember the WMD’s? Neither the politicians that approved using your tax dollars for it. You don’t ”take” the oil. You secure it.

1443 2018-10-01 20:55:08 We saw a truck spraying in Richlands, NC. Personally I’d stay away from anything like this, make your own soraybwith Apple cider vinegar, lemon essential oil & a bit of water in a spray bottle.

1473 2018-10-01 20:50:18 Noooo! Had a good session on the oil, kept the pipes warm and managed a McDonalds on the way home...

1477 2018-10-01 20:49:18 Pero si YPF es una empresa estatal. Tu comparación sería válida si a Oil la hubiese comprado Shell o Axion.

1479 2018-10-01 20:48:56 How would I know? It all depends on the EU elite and how far they want the ECB to go in terms of buying Italian bonds to keep yields down. Another issue could well be the oil price. Plenty of potential problems.

1482 2018-10-01 20:48:32 “America has reclaimed its throne atop the oil world. For the first time since 1973, the U.S. is the world’s largest producer of crude oil.”

So, explain again why we’re still using food to make ethanol? Stop using olden ‘Oil Crisis’ to force us to buy corn-ethanol we don’t need!
1483 2018-10-01 20:48:27 You don't pump your own gas, do you? The tax cut money is going to the oil companies. In more ways than one. #Beto4Texas
1484 2018-10-01 20:48:19 I can see that as well and generally I am fan of that but the D was leaking oil. Also...I played Madden like yourself. I tried to play real football--run the ball some/punt. I am not hip to the 4th and 5 in your own territory stuff

1487 2018-10-01 20:47:36 @caveofbeauty hey love! So i really wanna try oil cleansing. But have absolutely zero idea where to start
1488 2018-10-01 20:47:32 Nani?
The oil floats on the water which you pour in the sink later. There is minimal to no contact. Why adding oil than?
And people who salt the water for hardboiled eggs, yes, similar problem, no contact.
1489 2018-10-01 20:47:27 we went out for dinner tonight and i had a vegan vietnamese soup with chili oil and coriander and it was the absolute best

It's mothers leaving used nappies in car parks or down the loo. It's turning our 1 planet into a midden.

1514 2018-10-01 20:43:15 @Reuters reported that Venezuela's oil production fell to 1.25 million b/d in September. They had reported 1.38 mb/d in August, but now revised it to 1.30 mb/d. That implies a large decline in both months, from 1.42 mb/d in July. 170 tb/d in two months! The collapse continues.

1521 2018-10-01 20:41:55 The effect of that oil boom was even pushing up wages in the Maritimes as local businesses had to compete with Alberta’s draw.

1533 2018-10-01 20:40:38 It’s a good choice, though my usual interpretation of Green Ratchet nowadays is Oil Slick just cuz of my love for The Toxic Transformer. Still, using color schemes like those on Cybertronian modes is a smart idea.

1538 2018-10-01 20:39:58 So I don't seem like bad belle, lemme also wish Nigeria happy 58 years of independence. But honestly, we are not doing anything close to 'ok' at 58. We can do much better with education, health, security, mining, oil and gas, agriculture. We can do much better!
1539 2018-10-01 20:39:56 I hade one in British Racing Green, the 1800 version though. It was shite. Usual B series crankshaft oil seal problems. It got to the stage that I could have the engine out, change the seal and back in in an evening!
1540 2018-10-01 20:39:55 I've luckily stockpiled for approximately 3 months. Oil price can change drastically. People reading newspapers need a reminder that figures between brackets = price increase, figures without brackets = price decrease.

With regards to coconut oil and LDL; studies usually show coconut oil, palm oil and beef tallow not to increase LDL relative to olive oil and potentially soybean oil.

1557 2018-10-01 20:38:00 You have a point there. However, your efforts to mine BTC using vented or flared or “stranded”natural gas presented a compelling investment opportunity.
Obviously you have to adapt to market conditions, but I hope the change in oil markets doesn’t force you to abandon those aims.

1564 2018-10-01 20:36:58 Also, Standard Oil was on downslope, ~20% of market, when US took action. I'm not saying the market magically cures all ills, rather that regulators are often late, fighting the last battle or taking real-view action.

US may follow Europe on data protection, given global brands.

1628 2018-10-01 20:29:54 Well super just went up by $1. We should set a per litre subsidy and let oil prices fluctuate with w/e the diff between that n real price. Can even have a cap as well.

1631 2018-10-01 20:29:27 So basically it recovered from the second world war and further industrialized between 1950-70. Then bad industrial relations and the oil crisis stopped the rapid expansion in the 1970's and it never recovered its previous growth levels.

In other words nothing to do with the EU.

End of prohibition meant that the law had officers with nothing to do. Big pharma, Reefer Madness. You get the picture. I know ppl that have taken oil THC CBD for years.
1678 2018-10-01 20:24:26 YES!!! 

I use almond milk!! Today I put 1 cup of almond milk, stevia for sweetness (no exact measurement because stevia is something to def do to your taste lol), and sometimes I put vanilla or cinnamon or something for flavor! 

and collagen and MTC oil bc #health haha
1679 2018-10-01 20:24:24 My car leaked all it's oil so I can't get home, I burned a hole in my pants, and my hair is sticking up so much I look even more like ninja today. Today is A+.
1680 2018-10-01 20:24:24 Give it a zip by burning coriander and or cumin seeds in some virgin cold pressed coconut oil before adding the cooked peas...
1681 2018-10-01 20:24:21 Okay. I shouldn't do the whole can of milk? Sorry I'm new to this dish. I was planning on sauteeting onions and garlic in olive oil and 1tbsp curry powder then dumping in the whole can of milk and half tomato. Good or no?

1683 2018-10-01 20:24:10 PSA:

If you are buying and using straight CBDs based on what someone online is selling you -

   Please read how THC must be present with CBDs in order to obtain the desired effect

In other words - don't be a sheep - do your homework - 

Straight CBDs are effectively snake oil
1684 2018-10-01 20:24:03 Can someone help me change my oil plz n thank u
1685 2018-10-01 20:23:50 I need a manicure, a hair cut, a car wash, an oil change and about $20,000

You are the curly that makes it interesting.  Enjoy the looking back.
1688 2018-10-01 20:23:35 There has to be an essential oil that handles this problem...

1691 2018-10-01 20:23:16 It is good to see that oil prices are picking back up, and have been for a while. WTI increased 3.181% since the markets opened, Brent Crude increased by 2.816%. This means @BiotechBma will get busier.
1692 2018-10-01 20:23:01 It is nice this time of year. He may want to transition into an oil sheik before going though, just to be safe.

1697 2018-10-01 20:22:01 For me, it’s not that clear cut. I eat a lot of fats (nuts, seeds, olive oil, coconut oil, oily fish, cheese, avocado etc) & different types of carbs at different times. It’s a dynamic ratio, & trying to associate me with a particular dogma isn’t particularly accurate or useful

1700 2018-10-01 20:21:20 In meetings last week at #UNGA73 it was suggested that oil and gas companies are becoming energy companies. But one very wise participant suggested that they be better conceived of as "carbon management" companies - if dug up, then managed to ensure zero emissions.
1701 2018-10-01 20:21:17 Which song is better:

Beds Are Burning, Midnight Oil
White Wedding, Billy Idol
1702 2018-10-01 20:21:13 Diversifying our industries would be better. Oil and gas are too volatile, and we don't set the prices.

Your focus on O&G makes AB more vulnerable, not less.

1704 2018-10-01 20:20:54 I think that wasn't even really something the Russos or rdj had any say in. She was going to quit to focus on GOOP but then came back because everyone realized it was Snake Oil selling.  Like she wasn't really supposed to come back to mcu past avengers 1

we have come a long way wince 1997. 
in that year imports accounted for over 50% of oil consumption,  ALARMING
we are only a few more years to being net exporters
1708 2018-10-01 20:20:16 The oil field must be slow. I’ve never seen so many lifted trucks, boats and 4 wheelers for sale 
1709 2018-10-01 20:19:57 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
1710 2018-10-01 20:19:55 Bit of a lackluster finish after this morning's rational exuberance. I'd much rather see oil closer to 60 than 80, but gas prices haven't moved up as much as oil has. Hey @realDonaldTrump how bout a little help from the SPR..sell some barrels up here would be winning for everyone
1711 2018-10-01 20:19:51 I ordered body oil from Victoria secret like almost 2 weeks ago. Where my package at ? 
1712 2018-10-01 20:19:45 If you don’t want pills  have you tried clove oil on a Q-Tip and rub it on the area. Numbs everything and makes you smell like a hippy. 
1713 2018-10-01 20:19:33 Cooking veg for 2 doesn't use the whole pack. So I parboil carrots, turnips and potatoes, sprinkle them with olive oil, salt and pepper. About 5 minutes before they're done I portion and freeze. When I need them season and cook from frozen. You can stick them in a casserole too.
1714 2018-10-01 20:19:33 kept waking up and not being able to sleep last night, woke up 15 mins before my train, slipped on a drain, this girl got oil paint all over my top, got shouted at for breaking the guilenteen, the dinner lady burnt my pannini and had some rank hash browns. time 4 bed xox

1725 2018-10-01 20:17:26 I made sauteed Kale last night for the first time and my main takeaway is to pre-pour the amount of olive oil I will use because it goes from under-oiled to ecological disaster real quick when you freehand it.

1727 2018-10-01 20:17:19 someone complain to me about "mold" in the shower. I had the privilege of explaining that body oils excrete during a hot shower and cling to the walls.

1750 2018-10-01 20:14:31 The uncertainty in the insurance markets caused by trumpian dicking around with the ACA is largely responsible for any premium hikes. Funny you should mention gas prices... They are up due to withdrawal from the Iran deal, which took 2 million barrels of oil off the market.

1799 2018-10-01 20:09:02 Bilous says this gives Alberta more control over our resources - there is no specific commitment to set aside shipments to the U.S, - which shows they are no longer concerned about Canadian oil. He adds it's another reason why we need additional markets #yyc #abpoli #abgov

1813 2018-10-01 20:07:08 Speaking of which, there is nothing more imaginary that the whole concept of Niger Delta. What is the basis for a Niger Delta? Is it oil? Imo state and Osun state has oil? Is it a common history they share? They don't.
1814 2018-10-01 20:07:07 Do not boil gnocchi. Instead, cover the bottom of a skillet with olive oil, medium heat, saute gnocchi in it w/salt and pepper for twelve minutes, stirring once. Throw in a can of butter beans and spinach at the end, cover and wait for spinach to wilt, and YOU'RE DONE.

1831 2018-10-01 20:04:54 Burning fossil fuels puts CO2 into atmosphere & raises temps. Plastics etc made from oil don’t. Also they can be recycled.

Next - develop plant-based alternaves for plastics etc

Good stuff

1887 2018-10-01 19:57:17 OPEQ control over oil prices has been terrible for the U.S.  Isn't it possible, with the new level of American oil 'independence', for the U.S. to have it's OWN oil benchmark, circumventing OPEQ prices!

1890 2018-10-01 19:56:57 Good point but I have to say that at the time my memory is that most people in this province wanted it to go ahead.  Times were good, oil prices high, and it seemed to be a project most were behind.  I can't remember many who opposed it at the time.

1897 2018-10-01 19:56:28 Va has a weird law. A doctor has to get a license to write you a permission slip to use oil with cbd or thc-A. You can still be arrested for possession, but the permission slip gives you an affirmative defense. So it depends on the judge/prosecutor's prejudices.
1898 2018-10-01 19:56:24 Ffs, US oil comps. lost out on the worlds largest oil reserves, d’ya think they just accepted that with good grace ? Other OPEC members, colluding with US, increased oil production to lower the price. The VE leadership were reliant on the oil revenues and so the economy tanked.
1899 2018-10-01 19:56:20 I saw the big oil companies jumping in at the beginning of the wind scam. They clearly saw it as being in their commercial interests to promote global warming alarmism and the reason is obvious: as governments raised energy prices - oil companies made more money.
1900 2018-10-01 19:56:19 How will the UN handle this Captain bearing Russia Flag & who gets the oil & ship in S korea under arrest...

1919 2018-10-01 19:54:17 What I'm pushing for is that we (the institute) will produce a clear data led report which shows the need and profitability (or other measure of success) for a diverse workforce which could be used against this sort of snake oil data
1920 2018-10-01 19:54:14 So it is not just Oil that has sustained Nigeria, it is also this real fear of a from different and disparate quarters within Nigeria of an Igbo resurgence. And many Nigerians will rather sell their souls to the devil than let it happen.
1921 2018-10-01 19:54:08 If the judge, Robert Altham, has an interest in the oil industry surely that would b a case of conflict of interest. Don’t think much of the defence lawyers if the judge continued to preside on the case
1922 2018-10-01 19:53:45 One of my favourite sides is roast broccoli! Chop into little florets, drizzle with oil, and then season! Salt and pepper, garlic and parmesan, paprika and chilli are good seasonings! Roast for 20 mins, give it a shake in the middle.

1935 2018-10-01 19:51:41 Juxtapose the oil wealth in those countries with their population, etc, they simply have enough to spare, if not they'd be poor too, that's the difference with Nigeria.

1946 2018-10-01 19:50:50 Hey, "francis" - what happened with the "$CRC is beta of Oil"??...Gee look - Oil: +3%, CRC: fat ZERO move!...Hmmm ;)...
1947 2018-10-01 19:50:25 Creo que #OIL tenia una refinería
1948 2018-10-01 19:50:21 I made a sandwich with the gormet turkey meat fried in my favorite oil and topped with thin slices of Swiss cheese and pickled jalapeno slices. I added some name brand ranch dressing all on whole wheat bread. That normally would have knocked me out but I had laundry to do
1949 2018-10-01 19:49:39 For everyone asking what has she got to gain, Anita Hill has done pretty good for herself over the years, and GoFundMe didnt even exist.
1950 2018-10-01 19:49:37 63% to 73% less to drive than your Jetta but about twice as much to purchase so it will take 20 years of ownership to make the savings back financially and that is if you also include service like oil changes.
1951 2018-10-01 19:49:36 Time to haul in the rorting Petrol companies.. I remember about 18mth ago when oil his $160+ a barrel and fuel was $2.16 a litre BUT now Oil is $80.00 a Barrel and fuel is $2.17+ here in levin.  It's a Rip Off
1952 2018-10-01 19:49:23 Bro $JPY should shit itself against everything with this oil and this yields.
1953 2018-10-01 19:49:17 best way to clean your #face is with soft white facecloth. Use a milk based or oil cleanser as you don’t want anything harsh on your face. I have never used soap on my face, too drying. I bring a few cloths when I am travelling and makeup wipes. now you  have a canvas to work on

1955 2018-10-01 19:49:06 Not a word on the broadcast about the terrible steal attempt by Braun.  Late jump, easy out, gave away an out and probably a sac fly run
1956 2018-10-01 19:49:03 Well so far, it looks like it works for Canada middle class. Other than for the oil part, which should increase in price so we find better energy options.
1957 2018-10-01 19:49:01 Not in them but good luck.
1958 2018-10-01 19:48:55 Just mashed yam porridge with no pepper and oil...lol!
1959 2018-10-01 19:48:51 I need to do a hot oil treatment  and then I need to wash this stuff.
1960 2018-10-01 19:48:21 @tradingbot And we could get there. In that scenario I think we'd see a lot more upside than a $1.  But $100 oil hasn't been good for stocks
1961 2018-10-01 19:48:21 I like KitKat's, have done since I was a kid, but the time has long since passed when you could get away with using palm oil in your recipe.
1962 2018-10-01 19:48:13 Cost of supporting Brent is trivial compared to gains made from physical oil priced directly or indirectly vs Brent. Since mid 2017 Saudi gains & China loses give or take $100bn a year on oil
1963 2018-10-01 19:48:12 Even with newly achieved U.S. energy 'independence', does this mean that the U.S. can not be harmed by another countries energy policies- Is there a committee 'specifically' meant to deal with preventing high U.S. oil prices, thus affecting U.S. national security.
1964 2018-10-01 19:48:09 Hey Justin...#ukog  AND #angs looking exciting now . Bring on those tankers !!
1965 2018-10-01 19:48:06 Bugger - maybe just peppermint oil, then? Our littlie gets badly congested and _always_ has a post-viral cough for about a month post-cold that massively disrupts his sleep, so I'm a bit more paranoid than most 
1966 2018-10-01 19:48:04 I want that pussy with a lil olive oil on top
1967 2018-10-01 19:47:59 $cei  THAT OIL PRICE AINT QUITTING
1968 2018-10-01 19:47:47 #CommsChat Think a movie about an org going through a major crisis (BP’s oil spill for example) would be interesting as it would show the fast-paced and agile nature of comms but root that in realism still..not made to be too fantastical/OTT.
1969 2018-10-01 19:47:44 right shock sure- just like you were stunned when Obama & McCain & HRC & Cheney all murdered thousands of Muslims for oil in North Africa, Syria, Iraq & of course the CIA poppies in Afghanistan-you sit on your dildo & do nothing-AmericaISFucked because of people like YOU
1970 2018-10-01 19:47:42 School nurses used to weigh and meadure children annually, to ensure they were developing properly, were healthy, and didn't have head lice, or myopia etc. If there was something wrong, Mum was advised accordingly. A good thing, like the orange juice, cod liver oil, and malt.

1981 2018-10-01 19:46:41 I’m also a coconut and cran ras la croix stan .... people say the coconut is gross but I say it tastes somehow nostalgic... like watching your moms friend oil herself w sun tan lotion, clad in a very 90s bikini, and I’m into that
1982 2018-10-01 19:46:28 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
1983 2018-10-01 19:46:06 Not a problem X I hate to see someone nice being taken advantage of.  You can also ask a friend who knows what their doing if they would help, if they change oil spark plugs break pads and all the rest of the bits it's less than £60 quid X parkers is good for that stuff

1987 2018-10-01 19:45:37 #osr19-first loss is probably best loss, but less home produced oil =more imports, long term loss of controls will mean more imported GM oil, all we need is a level playing field
1988 2018-10-01 19:45:32 Slice the ‘berg in thin long strips, and slice the oranges SUPER thing then remove the peel. This works best with naval oranges. Then arrange the orange circles over the ‘berg, salt pepper and light oil over all that. Really refreshing.

1994 2018-10-01 19:45:06 We are slave to World Powers. Its a myth we got independence in 1947. We are still pawn to the British,US and Russian nexus of evil. We can't get fugitives out of Britain, US won't let us buy Iranian Oil, Russian will sell us unproven missile system. Indian sovereignty is a myth.

2008 2018-10-01 19:43:09 It seems BC Liberals don't understand they'll be on the hook for clean up once oil reaches the beach? BTW has the City of Vancouver ever received the clean up money from the Marathasa spill?
2009 2018-10-01 19:43:07 Oil can be good! Use what works! (And I guess I need to check the skin care aisle at TJs now?)

2013 2018-10-01 19:43:01 For 7 straight years, the U.S. has pumped more oil & gas out of the ground than any other country. U.S. natural gas production exceeded Russia's in '08, & exceeded Saudi Arabia’s oil production in '13. Since '08, U.S. petroleum and natural gas production has jumped nearly 60%.
2014 2018-10-01 19:42:57 Warm up some olive oil, honey, and crushed garlic in a pan. It'll do wonders.
2015 2018-10-01 19:42:51 Pump and dump seems to be occurring with more frequency. Given oil prices and yields I would be careful.
2016 2018-10-01 19:42:48 MY BOO STARTED TAKING BLACK SEED OIL! HIS DICK GONE GET BIGGER IM LOW KEY SCARED LMAO
2017 2018-10-01 19:42:47 OPEC is actually trying to keep prices from going to $100. Can think of it as a central bank. Oil at $100 be a big dent on demand: food for now, hunger for the morrow.
2018 2018-10-01 19:42:47 Pepsi has a palm oil problem & its CEO @IndraNooyi has one week left at the helm, it’s time for her to end @PepsiCo’s deals with scandal-mired #palmoil business partner @Indofood

2021 2018-10-01 19:42:23 Whenever i hear the phrase oil tycoon i think of Doug Dimmadome

2024 2018-10-01 19:41:57 Such a caring and loving man. Recently met him during his Industrial training in katsina. During our short stint stays man telling me his plan give birth to as many children as possible little did he knew he got little time ahead. May his soul rest in jannah
2025 2018-10-01 19:41:44 So for tacos I basically just cook everything fajita style. Cut up some onions and usually 3 colors of bell pepper, sautee the veggies and the veggie crumbles with vegetable oil over a mid-way between medium and high heat, add seasonings halfway through cooking and bam.
2026 2018-10-01 19:41:39 Despite the fact oil exports are not large, price tracking is very strong.  Some oil contracts are paid using Euros, a lot is Iran related
2027 2018-10-01 19:41:18 How does the impact of America becoming a major oil producer impact this relationship ( for the US only ) in your opinion?
2028 2018-10-01 19:40:52 It's horrible, poor you. Have you tried steaming? Boiling hot water in a bowl, inhale the steam before you go to bed. If you've got any Olbas Oil, put a few drops in. It's good for chesty coughs as well as blocked noses!
2029 2018-10-01 19:40:51 The story depicts the trapper as a security guard for a palm oil plantation.
These plantation owners kill orangutans, tigers, any animal they believe threatens their crops. Maybe they should be the ones trapped.
2030 2018-10-01 19:40:44 Ezinne, I bless God for your life. Your oil will not run dry. Amen.

2033 2018-10-01 19:40:13 You haven’t grasped the argument. No-one’s arguing that our energy provision doesn’t depend heavily on oil. Obviously it does. The problem is that this is unsustainable in climate terms.
2034 2018-10-01 19:40:12 Did he also mention how he’s fine with oil rigs off Florida’s beaches?
2035 2018-10-01 19:40:11 It will be pretty soon I'm sure that gene pool has a major oil spill

2039 2018-10-01 19:39:52 The wildcard is domestic shale and Trump.  I doubt Trump is going to be silent on The Sheiks and OPEC as they manipulate prices up.  Been long oil and energy since 2016 but doubt Trump is going to let oil go to $100 without a Tweet or retaliation against the Sheiks.
2040 2018-10-01 19:39:49 Apparently peppermint oil works well, I haven't had any in my room yet since I have been spraying it around over the past few weeks x
2041 2018-10-01 19:39:26 I just play it by ear or so to speak. I look to see what fresh ingredients I have plus a few store cupboard stables then create, olive oil, beautiful tomatoes, peppers,garlic, onion, capers, basil leaves, season hey presto I have a pasta dish ready in 15 minutes give or take ...
2042 2018-10-01 19:39:23 Never heard of strawberry oil for skincare.. hmm should I try?
2043 2018-10-01 19:39:21 By itself it's positive due to shale oil. Yet it's negative for most of the world. It also has significant secondary impact via nudging central banks to increase rates to push associated inflation down.
2044 2018-10-01 19:39:15 Oil and gas bb
2045 2018-10-01 19:39:15 what are the benefits of that, as opposed to lets say, tea tree oil after exfoliating?
2046 2018-10-01 19:39:12 Take that back oil king got style
2047 2018-10-01 19:38:58 some of us have updated to coconut oil
2048 2018-10-01 19:38:37 i do have an interesting observation for health experts....
after giving up, i cough black particles from my throat(i believe), not lungs,
when i have just eaten certain foods,
narrowed it down to tomatoes, salt, oil, or chilies....
could this be used to eat away flu germs ???
2049 2018-10-01 19:38:27 Another epic fail. No resolve on the 20% tariffs with aluminum/steel. No softwood lumber resolve. Canada continues to export oil at a 50% discount to the USA. #USMCA #NAFTA
2050 2018-10-01 19:38:17 Tonight I'll try and #stream some #quake3 before #TheSims4, hopefully plenty of time as I gotta be up early tomorrow for oil change... Yay.
2051 2018-10-01 19:38:06 Bruhh never bring your car to the dealership for a oil change..... I’ve been here almost 3 hours
2052 2018-10-01 19:38:04 They'll curse you with a curse that forces you to always paint with oil yet always suck
2053 2018-10-01 19:38:02 @BNNBloomberg Sll the experts???for months saying TSX down because of NAFTA talks & oil down. Well what do I say today on the shitty TSX.
2054 2018-10-01 19:38:01 Artificially raised oil price 80$ will be suddenly dropped to 30$,just believe.All it's big and ugly game which will not  so long continue.
2055 2018-10-01 19:37:59 After the emotional gnocchi episode, the household has been pleased with Jamie's risotto. The atmosphere has, however, turned quite tense due to the re-surfacing of the long-standing argument on olive oil vs butter that a Roman and a Veronese just cannot solve. #JamieCooksItaly
2056 2018-10-01 19:37:46 A bigger issue  that #DriwningInPlastic is plastics are why the oil economy is unsustainable - as well as burning petrochemicals, we are locking them up in non -biodegradable, polluting plastics, millions of tonnes of them/year.
2057 2018-10-01 19:37:43 @Sarge986 Hey Sarge , im long and big on a penny oil stock STTX , u know anything about it ?

2060 2018-10-01 19:37:07 The Essential Home has helped my family with sooo many oil based remedies! I always consult Kala to see if we can find a natural solution before trying anything else. She goes above and beyond to help.
2061 2018-10-01 19:37:04 waiting to get an oil change and the guy sits down next to me like he’s gonna give me BAD NEWS and then he was like “lol ur cars a piece of trash, get a new one” so hows ur day goin everyone
2062 2018-10-01 19:36:59 Unlikely 

One of two things to explain the brief meeting in my opinion. Either an agreement on neutral zone oil already discussed and just signed by leaders, or a collapse in negotiations (perhaps an ultimatum from KSA).
2063 2018-10-01 19:36:53 I'm fat... but I know a lil bit lmao... Dairy, soy, caffeine meat oil
2064 2018-10-01 19:36:52 Once those pesky Europeans established their Euro US inflation exports slowed down, then they picked on China, high oil price support but even that is now unsure... Oil regions insurrections ending and Iran embargoes falling apart. Yup may have consequences...
2065 2018-10-01 19:36:51 Jajajaja..! En mi ciudad: AXION: $48.
YPF: 46.

Me falta SHELL, que no pasé todavía. Esos precios son de naftas PREMIUM. Esto está feo eh...
2066 2018-10-01 19:36:46 Just IMF will not be enough for Pakistan.We need IMF, Chinese loans and Saudi help (deferred oil payments) to make up the over USD 20 bio shortfall.

2068 2018-10-01 19:36:36 I didn’t need to see the rest, I like the beer sign and the seed corn sign and the old oil buckets.
2069 2018-10-01 19:36:24 As if the first time I drive my car I have an oil leak, the second time I drive my car I get a flat tyre. And then to top it all of when I’m stopped on the side of the road, my fucking ex drives past... at least I’m going through all this with @karlybraddick ....... class
2070 2018-10-01 19:36:22 No sh##- oil jamming some consumers and rates jamming real estate.
2071 2018-10-01 19:36:16 The only other solution that I know of.... And you won't like it... Is popping to the off license and buying the cheapest bottle of whiskey. Then follow the clove oil instructions
2072 2018-10-01 19:36:14 I 100/10 recommend using Morphe eyeshadow: I accidentally got peppermint essential oil in my eye and flushed my eye out w water for like 10min and all my eyeshadow stayed in place @MorpheBrushes but like how is your day going?
2073 2018-10-01 19:36:13 Any thoughts on CBD oil...
2074 2018-10-01 19:36:11 Rub some garlic butter on the steak, fry without any oil (the butter is enough) for 8 mins, turning every minute. There’s yer perfect medium steak there
2075 2018-10-01 19:36:01 髪乾かすのだるーい！！、
2076 2018-10-01 19:35:59 Also.. People who think they're creative by frying Pasta should be fried with it in the very same oil...
2077 2018-10-01 19:35:55 The Proportionality Clause has been removed. Canada is now free to sell its oil & gas on the World Market not just bound to sell to US. We need pipelines to both coasts & Churchill to ensure access to the world markets.
2078 2018-10-01 19:35:55 I can watch any number of #TheXFiles episodes about monsters or aliens or black oil and I'm generally fine, but give me an episode of a creepy child or a ghost it and I'm immediately watching through my fingers
2079 2018-10-01 19:35:52 I doubt they will but there's always seven seas castor oil or root beer.

2087 2018-10-01 19:34:48 I still don't know if higher oil is a positive or negative for US... given the shale oil they produce.
2088 2018-10-01 19:34:48 Lazar clearing waivers today makes me wonder
Zero former Oil Kings have found success in the NHL:
G. Reinhart has to be the highest drafted at 4th overall, already on his third team & stuck in the AHL.
Laurent Brossoit, samething. Third NHL team & stuck in the AHL too.....
2089 2018-10-01 19:34:47 oh no, that sounds awful! both products aren't heavily scented. Another option is to use a regular foundation but add some facial oil or regular moisturiser to it.

2092 2018-10-01 19:34:38 Pres Putin of Russia- feeling your rage on the russian ship detained at S Korea port for possibility of oil smuggling with N Korea, no doubt this was embarrassing & a surprise to you that the Russian Mob would undermine UN declaration & Russia Law... Hopefully this is a one time.

2102 2018-10-01 19:33:52 One consolation from higher oil prices  for India could be higher portfolio flows from the Gulf nations' sovereign funds and stronger NRI deposit stream.

2110 2018-10-01 19:33:03 Everyone is obviously anchored to the 70s but from what I've read the last few cycles has seen growth and inflation negatively correlated to oil price rises.
2111 2018-10-01 19:32:42 @DrBirute Dr. Birute, is there a comprehensive list of companies who illegally clear cut the forests in the name of palm oil? I'd like to compile a list of parent companies so we can see how it trickles into so many products Sometimes when people see the cycle they see themselves
2112 2018-10-01 19:32:37 Oil price and as I expected last February it is going all the way to around 100 $ due to OPEC deal and some other geopolitical reasons. My long positions with oil as $NOG $WTI are doing great so far! For a possible short big run we might consider $CEI $DNR... let us see
2113 2018-10-01 19:32:24 I used coconut oil o. Who has time for Bio oil. Using coconut oil now and so far so good.
2114 2018-10-01 19:32:18 It is very annoying.

2117 2018-10-01 19:31:53 Oil heading towards $100. US economy running at full steam. The Fed expects four more hikes by the end of 2019 (+1%). Market pricing only two hikes. What could possibly go wrong?

2123 2018-10-01 19:31:22 Pero es contra intuitivo, dado que al anunciar compras de reservas presionan un poco el precio del dólar. Pero insisto que con estos niveles de Oil, el dólar debería estar más cerca de 2.600 que donde está. Lo mantienen arriba expectativas.
2124 2018-10-01 19:31:18 It didn't work oh! I switched to coconut oil cos wasting money on bio oil was annoying me
2125 2018-10-01 19:31:17 my mom is BEGGING me to get an oil change
2126 2018-10-01 19:31:12 Not completely failing is hardly a win. Get fair price for our oil and you'll see economic prosperity never before seen here. We can even fund your economic boondoggles like the illegal immigrant / refugee racket.
2127 2018-10-01 19:31:00 @rollybello when our crude oil dry off,reserve by U.S will be sold to Nigeria because by then they will be operating on electric vehicles

2134 2018-10-01 19:30:18 What's triggering it, no debt/ oil growth?
2135 2018-10-01 19:30:18 I absolutely love a Tiger baguette, slice it in half and rub some olive oil in then fill with Serrano ham and sliced tomatoes!

2147 2018-10-01 19:28:48 Tom Pettys cover of I just wanna make love to you makes me want to slam my head against a wall until it bleeds at a beard oil convention or wherever all the neck beards that listen to this music hang out. Black Women do it best.

2149 2018-10-01 19:28:31 i’m at kwik kar getting my oil changed and i swear this lil man looks and acts just like mr joyner??
2150 2018-10-01 19:28:29 Maybe I'm over-egging with that term. But for the first time in many years, we have oil rising at a time when the Fed is hiking already. Higher oil may feedback into more hikes also. Low oil + QE/ZIRP have been a huge boon and now they're both gone.
2151 2018-10-01 19:28:22 The Feds aren't helping either. The Trudeau government has decimated the oil industry and now taxpayers are on the hook to compensate the dairy industry. Disastrous governance by the federal Liberals.

2154 2018-10-01 19:28:04 $SPX - US-China Trade War + Brent at $85....this is starting to look similar to 1972-74
What happened then?
1. Nixon raised import duties
2. Arab oil embargo 
3. Stagflation
4. $SPX fell 48% & bonds had negative returns = balanced fund carnage
5. Gold went vertical

2161 2018-10-01 19:26:58 Economy of any nation is dependent on both its HUMAN/NATURAL RESOURCES. We are currently in the 4th Industrial Revolution era, with an emphasis on KNOWLEDGE rather than on huge deposits of gold, oil, other minerals etc. The focus and real currency is productive PEOPLE #MANIVC2018

2165 2018-10-01 19:25:35 Find a wash that’s meant for your skin type. Wash 2 times a day. Morning and night. Use a toner after you wash your face. Get some tea tree oil if your face is breaking out. Use an exfoliant 2 or 3 times a week. Use a moisturizer meant for face too!
2166 2018-10-01 19:25:34 Brother are you for real or joke like Pappu? Do you know Dollar against Ruppee is all time high and may touch 80 also as fed interest rate increased further.Crudr oil across globe is being traded in Dollar, so $90 at the time of jaitely making statement and now is different
2167 2018-10-01 19:25:29 I have psoriasis and use Green People products. I shower with luke warm water. Try applying body lotion to wetish skin as it spreads over the skin more evenly; shower with coconut oil a few times a week; wear natural fibre clothing and turn down the heating a few notches.
2168 2018-10-01 19:25:27 And with the price of oil on the rise again (now around USD82/barrel)   then there will be more failures before too long.   Who will be next....????

2179 2018-10-01 19:24:41 Venezuela's problem is corruption/dictatorship. 

Venezuela has one of the world's biggest oil reserves. To say Venezuela has ran out of money, or sources of money, is simplistic reasoning.
2180 2018-10-01 19:24:21 But, crazy liberals in California are trying to shut down the oil production in California.
2181 2018-10-01 19:24:17 well "oil's well that ends well"

2198 2018-10-01 19:22:55 Neither global oil prices will go down nor the prices will come down in the country or neighboring country. Keep aside center, this is a topic no state gov will be open to discuss. Just the nature of the beast

2218 2018-10-01 19:20:37 So that the Turkish lira will gain even more. As you know Turkey totally relies on imports for oil and this will drain its fx reserves even more. People in London will surely love it market Turkey even more. Simple.

2223 2018-10-01 19:19:47 I saw that the oil companies were happy, which tells me that Trump or some buddy of his who contributes to his campaigns is likely happy. It all comes back to him personally benefiting somehow.
2224 2018-10-01 19:19:44 Oil at its highest around $140/barrel we were paying about R11/liter , oil now $83/barrel and we will be paying over R17/liter....... we can thank the @MYANC for the difference......
2225 2018-10-01 19:19:42 *Condi has an oil tanker named after her.. probably just a coincidence..
2226 2018-10-01 19:19:26 Right before oil stocks collapsed.

2233 2018-10-01 19:18:35 Dr. Pepper is superior to Mr. Pibb for one reason above all the others - Dr. Pepper has a medical degree. By comparison, Mr. Pibb is definitely just a snake oil salesman selling cure-all elixirs out of the back of his covered wagon in the Old West.
2234 2018-10-01 19:18:32 Fanatical anti oil sand/pipeline activist. The best friends anti pipeline activists have is Kenney and the rest of the CPC. Two pipelines thrown out due to their approval process.
2235 2018-10-01 19:18:26 Do you see parallels between 1997-2000 and 2015-2018?  Thinking EM problems/oil crash w/ brief earnings recession, US-centric recovery with vibrant tech sector growth / bubble, Fed tightening to ward off asset bubbles, etc. Corps leveraging up. History seems to rhyme.
2236 2018-10-01 19:18:19 with all this crisis woman di still talk about e rubbing oil for bda???? Pls have mercy on us!

2243 2018-10-01 19:17:27 Creates oil at geologic timescales.  We consume oil at human timescales. Hydrocarbons are a finite resource, although it turns out that finite number is larger than previously believed (enabled by tech improvements like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing).
2244 2018-10-01 19:17:21 I would have thought Olive Oil would be the one hypnotized by those beastly arms.

2248 2018-10-01 19:17:06 I don’t consider oil companies to be inherently bad, but the dissonance is off the scale when they attempt greenwash on climate change

2253 2018-10-01 19:16:43 A very quick way to do prawn or seafood and vegetable risotto. Use butter instead of any oil and remember lots of garlic.
2254 2018-10-01 19:16:35 Why is oil rallying so much
2255 2018-10-01 19:16:34 yes I cross train  my next competition is about 4 months away so I work on a different type of exercise than I am use to . Its the best way to improve as your body adjusts to the same exercise routine .
2256 2018-10-01 19:16:32 Petrotrin approached the gov for a US$56m guarantee for a line of credit to import crude oil bc the shipping co would not deliver otherwise; and an additional US$180m to guarantee loan refinancing. @Newsday_TT #ttbudget2019

2262 2018-10-01 19:16:15 No, not the US. It’s trump. Trump is a snake oil salesman; a con artist. Republicans go along with him because if they don’t he’s so vindictive and sleazy (mob mentality) they know he’ll lie, he’ll go as low as necessary to take them down.

2266 2018-10-01 19:15:59 Please remember... MOST of this is PAID trollism to disrupt and sew fear, uncertainty & doubt... these are NOT just dumb sad little creeps.  It's HIGHLY organized directed FUD,  bought & paid for by Big Oil/auto & their dark demons... DON'T BE SO NEIVE! Same for shorts!

2278 2018-10-01 19:14:53 * Brent crude oil near 4 year high of Iran sanctions... highest since November, 2014... supplemental by supply concerns before US sanctions against Iran, next month... 16 cents, $82.89 a barrel, 0852 GMD... $83.32... 4 year high... US light crude:
2279 2018-10-01 19:14:53 So many oil tweets in my stream today.
2280 2018-10-01 19:14:50 @Witherscbc Agropur is a dairy cooperative and most dairy producers in NS belong to it.Since joining this bigger group they have been making more money. some dairy farmers now feed palm oil to their cow to bring up fat content of milk.more money.

2283 2018-10-01 19:14:37 So Oil is now 75 dollars a barrel and it appears to be going higher. This winter is going to suck. You know who is to blame for this. Yup the Orange guy in the WH

2285 2018-10-01 19:14:32 Ameen
2286 2018-10-01 19:14:32 What about the people of Canada paying upwards of 40% more for dairy products than Americans? Or does your mom still buy your milk?  And the dairy industry does not employ or benefit more Canadians directly/indirectly than Oil and Gas.
2287 2018-10-01 19:14:32 this oil is called SPIKENARD....I sprinkle it in my car vents...to smell the SAME SMELL THE NOSE OF JESUS DID! :) they ACTUALLY sell oils in Christian packs: myrhrr, frankincense and spikenard. COOL
2288 2018-10-01 19:14:18 A soft medium and hard brush and natural oil and conditioners ask your female friends with natural hair what they use and get a bunch of durags or spend some money on a nice one so you won't lose it. There's no shortcut to waves you gotta brush like an hour a day
2289 2018-10-01 19:14:07 Oil bulls are back! WSJ: US crude gained $2.05 per barrel, or 2.80% to $75.30 today. It was the highest close since Nov 2014. Year to dated oil is up 25%!
2290 2018-10-01 19:13:46 Imbert: Govt intends to boost oil production to 100,000 barrels per day, which will increase revenue.

2300 2018-10-01 19:13:10 just googled this because I wasn't sure. Found this "It actually started out as a much different novel – it was a lot more straight sci-fi, following the story of an isolated family on an oil rig  after an environmental disaster, where the whole world had been flooded"

2305 2018-10-01 19:12:49 I have a few friends. They use olive oil because it absorbs and doesn’t stay oily

2307 2018-10-01 19:12:36 SOMEBODY TELL ME WHAT KIND OF PEN TO BUY MINE IS TOO HOT FOR OIL.
2308 2018-10-01 19:12:31 In 1957, Nigeria was the world’s largest palm oil exporter and was responsible for 43% of global palm oil production. In 2018 Nigeria is an importer of palm oil, spending $500 million importing it from Asia. Nigeria must either be restructured, or collapse financially
2309 2018-10-01 19:12:21 Lol, I'll try.
2310 2018-10-01 19:12:19 You need to get American women involved in the midterms! Trump is a spokesperson for the coal & oil industries and, without a change, we in Canada are rather hamstrung in tackling climate change. Big Business money drives their system (and ours as well).

2314 2018-10-01 19:11:57 I honestly haven't researched the precise impact of total embargo on Saudi Arabia but I figure it could be quite significant. And the UAE would be included as well presumably.  Ask Jimmy Carter what an oil crisis does to your popularity
2315 2018-10-01 19:11:56 If I’m paying $65 for an oil change, you can bet your ass I’m gonna take that free coffee and snack! 
2316 2018-10-01 19:11:46 Between Memlings oil painting and Ghirlandaio tempera I prefer the tempera because it’s brighter and and more crisp. However, the oil painting looks more realistic with the skin tone, etc. #Sacart1b

2318 2018-10-01 19:11:44 Oh I love money. Adore it even. And I have plenty of it. Which I suppose means that I can afford to ignore snake oil pitches...
2319 2018-10-01 19:11:40 So you went full on for the snake oil salesman.  Good to know.
2320 2018-10-01 19:11:37 I have googled my ass off.  Nothing.  It would help if we knew the name of the so called oil company.
2321 2018-10-01 19:11:25 this is true about how it works& every single second this process creates new oil & never run out of it&it's just obsolete
2322 2018-10-01 19:11:20 and for it to be mandatory by law to get your oil changed

2324 2018-10-01 19:11:19 There was an immediate reaction to the new NAFTA. The markets went up, indicating the wealthy realize they will make more money. The oil price went up. So more expensive fuel. The interest rates will go up. So housing will cost more. The rich get richer. The mid class..fucked.
2325 2018-10-01 19:11:09 Luvguv Bently & the home of Roy Moore. Need we say more about the state of this state? Plus they took the oil spill money for the big cities inland & screwed the coast where the damage was done. Just wait till they have to evavcute for a hurricane. Roads can’t handle the volume

2336 2018-10-01 19:10:11 We are a consumer driven economy, 68% of GDP.  “The continuation of the current expansion may depend largely on the strength of U.S. households,” noted Emmons, St Louis Fed.  Declining wages, rising oil, rising middle class taxes do not support American consumers.

Some things never change


2345 2018-10-01 19:09:37 3/3 I grew up in NE with anti-EU chat about the fishing, my worry is that farmers are next thanks to Brexit. We get little benefit from the oil now (ex. jobs) with proper taxes (per barrel not per value) is something not better than nothing? Interesting debate thanks, take care

2355 2018-10-01 19:08:16 That means you will vote for the corrupted government. Remember the crude oil price being 140 still petrol was 69, remember how during inflation India was least affected. Modiji is 12th pass and Dr. Manmohan Singh is recognised among the brilliant minds in the world.
2356 2018-10-01 19:08:07 Clove oil works a treat, but is vile. Soak a cotton wool pad in it and put it between the side of your mouth and the offending tooth... Any late night pharmacies around you so you can get some?

2362 2018-10-01 19:07:26 @jessmarie1214 did you know there was cdb oil for pets? When I took my dog to the vet over the weekend she was saying how they use it for separation anxiety, fear of thunderstorms, etc..
2363 2018-10-01 19:07:09 It doesn't take anything,but remember all them rich people in this country are oil money owners so they won't make money if u are not buying fuel and diesel for generator as much as u buy for cars.
2364 2018-10-01 19:07:06 Taking the oil from the sea bed and burning it is also negating the sea carbon sink ability. As that carbon is burnt, enters atmosphere and is reabsorbed into the sea and increases acidification. Mass deforestation, land clear in, burning occurring at higher rate than greening.
2365 2018-10-01 19:07:01 Already scheduled my second oil change on my car. 
2366 2018-10-01 19:06:54 Yea because there is demand for palm oil and many preservatives that you even find in bread in the UK! Customers go to the store and ask for all those nasty substances. Can't have their bread without palm oil 
2367 2018-10-01 19:06:51 It's 75.00 pruc of oil
2368 2018-10-01 19:06:47 My dad after I tell him my co-workers harass me, because I drive his electric car to an oil refinery.
2369 2018-10-01 19:06:44 Another oil airline I see. I honestly came across the name when they began their sponsorship of Man City FCwe had a similar case here with KQ, went on a buying spree, dug a crater and fell right in
2370 2018-10-01 19:06:23 Allah ya jikan sa, what's his name?
2371 2018-10-01 19:06:07 Oil showed fragility last yr.  Leafs more fragile now than you think. if adversity rises could hit harder than longer established deeper teams
2372 2018-10-01 19:05:55 @Newsday_TT  Finance Minister Colm Imbert hints about domestic oil production increasing to 100,000 barrels of oil per day.
2373 2018-10-01 19:05:48 "industrial" sources account for about 20% of US carbon emissions, and oil refineries are a major part of that
2374 2018-10-01 19:05:39 These hair growth serums really annoy me. You’ve been missold PPI about Black Girls’ hair not growing so now you’re rubbing cooking oil in your hair, actually taking care of it for once and you’re now calling normal growth miracle growth 
2375 2018-10-01 19:05:29 I did the ZX10 shock and Sonic Spings with heavier fork oil for the front. Huge improvement for street riding. 
2376 2018-10-01 19:05:26 That mix of magnolia tissue oil and gentle magic on stretch marks really works shame, especially if they're new..
2377 2018-10-01 19:05:15 Oil paso a manos de YPF. Esperemos que sea una buena para el cordón industrial, después de tanta cagada a palo por parte del proyecto neoliberal del señor gato

2381 2018-10-01 19:04:39 Waiting to get my oil change done at the dealership and all I've heard over the speakers is Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Whitesnake, Poison and Chicago. Not mad.
2382 2018-10-01 19:04:29 Nah for a oil change you just need a jack
2383 2018-10-01 19:04:25 salting the oil fields...with your tears.
2384 2018-10-01 19:04:22 Imbert: Govt intends to boost oil production to 100,000 barrels per day, which will increase revenue.
2385 2018-10-01 19:04:20 Are we getting Lucas oil champion apparel soon? 
2386 2018-10-01 19:04:17 #nbsliveat9 Uganda should sacrifice its revenue and start to extract its oil wells. We can do better
2387 2018-10-01 19:04:16 WOGI - WORLD OIL GROUP INC - fillings out stock is waking up.
2388 2018-10-01 19:04:15 There's an analysis out about the likelihood and consequences of oil spills on the Hudson River. @scenichudson commissioned Environmental Research Consulting to undertake what it calls the first-ever Hudson River Oil Spill Risk Assessment (HROSRA). @WAMCNews
2389 2018-10-01 19:04:13 #JerryBrown has promoted the salmon-exterminating #DeltaTunnels, approved 21,000 new oil and gas drilling permits, driven endangered salmon, #Deltasmelt and other fish closer to extinction & oversaw record water exports and fish kills in 2011. He's #BigOil & #BigAg's Governor.
2390 2018-10-01 19:04:11 oh & BTW I also read your report that you so proudly display on your profile, it made great reading as a work of fiction, nowhere did it mention the billions of pounds that #Scotland pays in UK debt interest, neither did it mention the tax breaks given to oil companies in 2015/16
2391 2018-10-01 19:04:10 Ok I thought the same but if it's crossed with smoked chili oil you might reconsider
2392 2018-10-01 19:04:09 Awwwweeeeee long past due for a oil change  gotta due Maintence on the reliable Nissan
2393 2018-10-01 19:03:57 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
2394 2018-10-01 19:03:55 No. No no no no. His cap hit I do believe is 3 Mil fer the next two years...just like any other oil fan out there, I'd love to have Gags back. But his production has slid over the last few years.
2395 2018-10-01 19:03:36 So what does Trump do when China invests big in VZ to replace Iran oil

Then starts a military presence in VZ to protect their investment?
2396 2018-10-01 19:03:36 By wrong #oil grade, do you mean the wrong #viscosity grade for the engine or the wrong oil standard (for example, an oil suited for #gasoline engines rather than #diesel engines)?
2397 2018-10-01 19:03:26 Get some olibus oil Kirk x
2398 2018-10-01 19:03:17 I've been developing my own Oil mixes which I call Cancoctions...awesome to see people doing it with dried flower as well!  Imagine where we will be a year after legalization with all the options at our disposal :)
2399 2018-10-01 19:03:06 DC has the highest percentage of heavy drinkers in the country. These people practically live in bars. Alcohol is the lubricant that keeps the gears turning. Best place to find loose lips, networking, deal making.
2400 2018-10-01 19:03:02 Seriously true he’s a snake  oil salesmen that had half the country’s population duped just like me YUCK

2435 2018-10-01 19:00:06 $MXC thin name but with a good looking chart. With the Oil gaining momentum, everything is possible here. Im trying to add.
2436 2018-10-01 19:00:03 The country have been decimated by the red flu. who knows when it was stolen. Cubans have been making raids into Mexico and probably the US for a while. The US doesn't have the manpower to defend it borders any longer. An could only deploy 900 men to defend a oil terminal.

"A rationally based, fundamentally induced, price increase will give way to an emotionally driven rally when oil crosses the threshold from a supply shortage to an inventory shortage."

It's just starting.

Fellow Nigerians avoid taking food that contains palm oil once it is 7pm at night,it lowers life span by blocking air ways to the lungs..pass it to your loved once..

2445 2018-10-01 18:58:56 YAWN! Haven't we had enough of this? Same happened to a lad who had peanut oil in his curry a couple of years ago. The restaurant owner was imprisoned  but I suppose the courts won't do that with Pret as they're a huge American chain. Too much to lose in taxes! That's what!
2446 2018-10-01 18:58:50 You guys, CBD oil is the best.
2447 2018-10-01 18:58:40 Did you compensate oil workers like you’re going to do with Quebec farmers.
2448 2018-10-01 18:58:30 Great News from Switzerland, guys, where the teat from the City leads.  We are going to keep using Palm Oil since it would be bad for our economy to stop.  Our chemical industries have to push out deadly chemicals since we need the profits.
Sorry about your Austerity.  Tah Tah.
2449 2018-10-01 18:58:27 Oil is at almost $76 a barrel and the prime interest rate is now almost 3.1%.  Are you paying attention.....

2451 2018-10-01 18:58:22 Trump on OPEC “US not  going to put up with..these horrible prices much longer… We defend  many of these nations for nothing and then they take advantage of us by  giving us high oil prices, not good. We want them to stop raising  prices, we want them to start lowering prices"

This whole episode should make us more focussed on oil and Gas, which will never ever lets us down or become unprofitable.

Now who uses oil instead 
2478 2018-10-01 18:55:55 A cheer just now from my son as he sees that the restaurant he is working in has retailed its Michelin star.

I am sure it is all down to him and the way he strips 10 kilos of lovage to make a tiny amount of lovage oil.
2479 2018-10-01 18:55:52 I got a $4.5 billion idea. 
Let's just permanently drop a line of rail cars from AB to Tidewater. Weld them together, then Pump oil through them..... pipelines are bad, railcars are magic....or something....

2497 2018-10-01 18:53:49 So can we get some pipelines built to export oil and gas now?
2498 2018-10-01 18:53:45 I heard it makes grain harder to ship because there are not enough trains. They are all moving oil now

2504 2018-10-01 18:52:44 Some folks recommend the oil drops. Personally I don't use it because it makes me hoarse.  But both my daughter and I  fell in love with the ointment. and You only have to use a tiny amount (half a dime size), to get good results!
2505 2018-10-01 18:52:37 Fries bananay thay jab aloo kaat liye to pata chala kay oil nahi hai 
2506 2018-10-01 18:52:34 I am sick of seeing some ignorant people here and there alleging Turkey bought oil from IS. That's just pure propaganda, nothing else.
2507 2018-10-01 18:52:31 Yes, I do realize this. I was just taking the opportunity to insult Pete Davidson. I agree with the premise of the article and watched the barely watchable episode. I did love Adam Driver, tho. Especially the skit where he played the ruthless oil baron. Hilarious!

2520 2018-10-01 18:51:04 International crude oil cost is going up
2521 2018-10-01 18:50:59 Maybe with price increase, Trump will call time for new sanctions on #Iran and this signals to Iran to negotiate and its a win-win.  Trump will get lower oil prices in time for mid-term elections and potentially get a deal with Iran.
2522 2018-10-01 18:50:45 You don't get to slap a New Name on NAFTA an call it a New deal for God Sake! The American people aren't that Stupid! It's like giving a old dog a new name an saying now he's a Puppy again! The only New thing about it is the Deregulation on Gas/oil to ruin our clean air & Water!
2523 2018-10-01 18:50:41  I dunno what the big negative review is all about with coconut oil, but my teeth are nearly white and I brush with it, twice a week. I have no sensitive teeth.  we are raising our kids wrong af - flouride destroys the brain and poison the body.

2529 2018-10-01 18:50:18 Brent hits $85  so say you have 1 million barrels of oil recoverable how does the valuation of your company stand if the oil price rises say 40$. because thats the main difference from last year . do the maths.
2530 2018-10-01 18:50:09 You two @Samir_Madani and @Paul91701736 actually do some very similar work, Sami’s tracking oil shipments all over the world and you look behind the curtain of our favorit billion dollar penny stock.

2544 2018-10-01 18:48:59 When your skull is crucified in the living oil, death leaves you. 
2545 2018-10-01 18:48:49 Oil companies are doing fine oil prices are about to go through a four year high!
2546 2018-10-01 18:48:39 Tip: If you use gel in your hair and don't want it smelling like gel use a natural oil to give it a scent after applying gel....I use rose water :)
2547 2018-10-01 18:48:21 Very nice job! I do something like that with crude oil tankers on @TankerTrackers
2548 2018-10-01 18:48:17 It's been a long while since an actual public policy discussion occurred in this province. "Carbon bad, oil good" seems to be the extent of it.
2549 2018-10-01 18:48:14 $PTR look at this thing. China oil. No position unfortunately.

2553 2018-10-01 18:48:00 Very proud of having made some vibrant and delicious dill oil. Eldest finds it: ‘What’s this bloody pond water?’
2554 2018-10-01 18:47:51 Brown sugar with honey or brown sugar with olive oil.
2555 2018-10-01 18:47:45 I got popped by the oil on my chest while singing and i thought i got shot byeee

2558 2018-10-01 18:47:31 And none of those actions are sufficient to lower total methane emissions bc of cumulative impacts from wells old and new, and you know that, Mark. Oil/gas wells are methane cigarettes in the earth; @EnvDefenseFund continues to push for better filters rather than smoking bans.
2559 2018-10-01 18:47:28 Holy Balls, oil going ballistic here!  Trumps going to be so pissed..
2560 2018-10-01 18:47:27 Chef Kawasaki cut up some chocolate, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some  human flesh, along with hot sauce.
2561 2018-10-01 18:47:24 Favourite moment in the story is when Matilda changes Mr Wormwood’s hair oil to Mrs Wormwood’s peroxide. As I child I found this hilarious!
2562 2018-10-01 18:47:16 Coconut oil is great for your skin, which I hope includes the bruises you get when it turns your toilet seat into the worst Slip 'N Slide.

2570 2018-10-01 18:46:14 Thats why hoteps are not smarter than a 5th grader. They are snake oil merchants at best.

2572 2018-10-01 18:46:06 I have to get some castor oil for my baby hair and a silk cap
2573 2018-10-01 18:46:06 Oil, usd, irate, labor. But let’s think margins can keep expansion going. Seems right.
2574 2018-10-01 18:46:06 change of oil she will be fine.
2575 2018-10-01 18:45:50 The Rosehip oil? It is good. I’m the same loool like sometimes I’ll do the whole routine then sometimes I just wash my face and use the oil. But I notice when I’m consistent with it it makes a massive difference
2576 2018-10-01 18:45:44 Yes they look perfect  Toss the radishes with some melted butter or oil and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Roast them for about 10-15 minutes.
2577 2018-10-01 18:45:37 The Avo and olive oil combo does wonders for my hair
2578 2018-10-01 18:45:17 May his soul rest in peace
2579 2018-10-01 18:45:17 What do the Winchesters give each other for Christmas? Sam gets skin mags and shaving cream. Dean gets motor oil and beef jerky. #S3Rewatch #Supernatural

2583 2018-10-01 18:44:32 $cei Oil is UP....Power Hour is here lets ROLL $CEI
2584 2018-10-01 18:44:25 the same way mine knows the difference between the mailman (who he ignores) and the oil guy (who he HATES) from behind closed doors, aka nonsense dog logic.
2585 2018-10-01 18:44:18 Does putting essential oil on the wool balls help with the static? I've used the wool balls by themselves and they've made all my clothes full of static electricity everytime to the extreme. Am I doing something wrong?

2588 2018-10-01 18:44:03 I wanna order this oil soo bad
2589 2018-10-01 18:44:00 Lol - I don’t think @twitter is going to take action on this. I take your answer to mean that you do not have a relevant PhD, or any PhD at all, and that you consult for oil companies, who pay you to lie about AGW on Twitter. Feel free to correct / block me - or defend yourself.
2590 2018-10-01 18:43:53 Destroy the oil companies; let the markets rebuild.

2594 2018-10-01 18:43:42 I get part of the deal with Sportsnet and TSN is to push the Maple Leafs to their viewers in their promos, as both carry games, but it's rather comical how they go on about John Taveras as if he's the second coming. A very good player to be sure but let's not be silly here.
2595 2018-10-01 18:43:32 Crude oil Nov18 92 Calls trade 207 times
2596 2018-10-01 18:43:27 Geezuz Jim,ur comments keep getting more ridiculous!

1) Acquired him for nothing as UFA
2) Flipped JJ for a 6th-that means Oil GAINED a pick
3) Oil get $1M off the books who are close to max cap
4) Oil save a contract off the 50 limit

Amazing u think this is a bad move
2597 2018-10-01 18:43:22 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
2598 2018-10-01 18:43:22 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2599 2018-10-01 18:43:21 Just 1 km though? I know the Seawise Giant oil tanker was almost half a km back in the 70's, so we could do better than double of the longest maritime ship.

Let's at least make sure it's length can round up to 10 km

2614 2018-10-01 18:42:12 Oh well. I’ve been told there isn’t much demand for oil and we’re all going to switch renewables in the next 20 minutes anyway so I’m sure it won’t be an issue for long.

2623 2018-10-01 18:41:07 Senator Graham has eyes, ears, reasoning skills and intellect.  Anyone who believes Senator Graham buys any of the snake oil he's peddling regarding Brett Kavanaugh has poo for brains or values partisan rankering above country, decency, and truth.

2628 2018-10-01 18:40:29 Indeed to get oil from Libya to anywhere in Africa would be bloody arduous. The Sahara desert is a formidable barrier; without oil pipelines in place, you’d have to ship it literally around the continent. If anyone was robbed of a proximity oil supply, it was Europe.

2653 2018-10-01 18:38:24 Flake sold out to the oil companies in the early 2000 he must say what he is told to say.
2654 2018-10-01 18:38:17 Coconut Oil gave me whiteheads, grapeseed oil made me sick, avocado oil was next in line if EVOO didn't work.

But it did!!! 
2655 2018-10-01 18:38:13 Pick your own is reference to @48Nrth processing it on their own dime ... I can read...  I know it’s for oil ... but to trim and dry it and test it and package it and ship it ... as pick your own to save $... hope that clarified ... no such thing as sun processed here ...
2656 2018-10-01 18:38:08 Oil and gas sector is regulated by federal government and licensing is also done by federal govt. Government has legal authority to sign government to government deals related to oil and gas.
2657 2018-10-01 18:37:59 Gotta say, I'm a little surprised at how much small things like Omega 3 supplements like fish oil and green lipped mussel extract have improved my quality of life.

If you got issues with your joints or osteoarthritis, give it a try.

2659 2018-10-01 18:37:51 So my lunch was a mixture of apple slices with veggies, roasted in a bread pain at 450f with curry power, salt and chili powder. With olive oil drizzled on top

Verdict: it was at pretty damn good

2661 2018-10-01 18:37:31 When I use just 1 cube of Maggi, palm oil, onions, pepper and small Cray fish to cook; Rice Will taste so good. But when I have small Change and decide to use chicken, beef, Kpomo, fresh Fish and Tin Tomatoes, Rice will now be tasting like Pap mixed with Kerosene. I'm tired 
2662 2018-10-01 18:37:23 Overall perhaps but not to the severity of 3-4c kWh one year increase 1 year before MF power came online and after first power, consumers would adjust consumption and all of the oil price forecasts were completely off the mark, HRT 2X generation by 2041 $200 oil said proponents
2663 2018-10-01 18:37:22 I still fit into my grade 10 school shorts...

2671 2018-10-01 18:36:19 Oil surges above $75 a barrel to the highest level since Nov. 2014.  Gas prices are rising, but they want to raise our regressive gas tax? How about we vote to raise the minimum-wage instead! And clawback the billions of dollars in tax cuts to Big Biz and millionaires!
2672 2018-10-01 18:36:09 Scotland found two new oil fields last month and one trillion cubic feet of gas last Wednesday and they reckon their is more of both enough to last another 50-100 yrs but of course it’s not in the news so you are wrong we are going independent we want neighbours not masters

2686 2018-10-01 18:35:17 Given how much flowing water there is in British Columbia electricity prices are too high. Let's build some dams, and get some oil in to cover surges!

2700 2018-10-01 18:34:32 Toch heeft de VS geschiedenis geschreven met hun Sherman Act. IBM en diverse oil companies weten dat nog wel. Maar onder Trump waait er een heel andere wind. Reken maar dat met rechtse rechters er geen enkele anti-trust zaak wordt aangespannen.

2777 2018-10-01 18:28:35 Ah! I see your problem! You have a buttonless low voltage battery that’s good for wick carts, but ours are ceramic C-Cell carts! The oil in our carts is thicker and stronger and requires a button battery that’s at least 4 volts.  Most of the Ooze batteries are strong enough.

2779 2018-10-01 18:28:23 The high volume breakouts in many MLP names including some funds is encouraging but only a step. These have been heartbreakers and homewreckers.

2789 2018-10-01 18:26:51 The world has a drinking problem (oil) and it's time we admit it. Otherwise, our "accidental" suicide is all but guaranteed.
2790 2018-10-01 18:26:39 In 2010, during the BP oil spill,  Chuck Grassley took $137,450 from the oil and gas industry
2791 2018-10-01 18:26:35 It's 75.00 a barrel of oil 
So basiclaly I't be over 4.00 end this week
2792 2018-10-01 18:26:26 Where are those that want to use Social media to burn this country, hope you heard @MBuhari broadcast today, you'll be dealt with accordingly.
2793 2018-10-01 18:26:16 “I need my oil changed” 
“Is that code for something” 
“.....”
2794 2018-10-01 18:26:10 Yes! We suggest using our Wake & Bake Hydrating Face Oil before applying your foundation. Let the face oil dry completely first, then apply your foundation. Let me know if you have any more questions! 
2795 2018-10-01 18:26:03 They go absolutely nowhere and it’s a function of how susceptible your skin is to it. I do full body scrubs ever so often to ensure my skin tone is even and I use vitamin e oil + EVOO for loose skin. I’ve embraced mine...for now. Counting my coins to fix problem areas .

I have witnessed your interview about ethene oil. We are interested to produce ethene oil from raw materials like municipal waste and rice husk I hereby regard you to grant us one appointment for the detail discussion of the project. Awaiting for Ur quick response
2799 2018-10-01 18:25:17 I take a multivitamin, a B12 blend, garlic, turmeric, evening primrose, a probiotic, fish oil, asthaxanthin, ashwaghanda, and an antidepressant. I’ve perfected the dry swallow in the absence of water.
2800 2018-10-01 18:24:58 As if I needed another reason to get rose oil 
2801 2018-10-01 18:24:51 I’m from Barkerend you wet wipe, I work in the Azerbaijani oil fields
2802 2018-10-01 18:24:39 Yep! I have access to everything I need here to make my own with actual medical cannabis. I have CBD oil upstairs. I have THC oil upstairs too. I know exactly what is in it because I make my own oils!!
2803 2018-10-01 18:24:31 @realDonaldTrump I warn the government of the United States, if sanctions are violated in the same way, and the country is exempted from the oil embargo, do not doubt that the Democrats will win the election and the tramp will be impeached. I will never make a mistake

2805 2018-10-01 18:24:21 Yup, need a full list of ingredients. I am allergic to all nuts, coconut and sesame. Coconut is rarely mentioned and yet I have noticed some spreadable butter using coconut oil. Now I worry that a restaurant will use it unknowingly and I will get very ill or die. Scary world.

2808 2018-10-01 18:23:51 We have more control over oil prices then you suggest. As oil bought in USD, increasing interest rates would support the Kiwi. Fuel cost is a bigger issue in the regions. Not many buses from Auckland to Kaikohe etc. Increased fuel costs will marginalise regions more.
2809 2018-10-01 18:23:50 the most lumbersexual thing i can think of is 90 dollar beard oil that smells like an extra-hoppy IPA
2810 2018-10-01 18:23:45 so i accidentally spilled some drops of my frankincense essential oil and now it smells weird and i feel SO BAD i’m so SORRY
2811 2018-10-01 18:23:13 much agreed....fed taking liquidity out, putting it back in through stock market panic to come...where does oil go...?
2812 2018-10-01 18:23:10 Well it does hold 3 *gallons* of oil so it should hold out for a while but I have thought about that too if I were to do this I would plan for the necessity of doing oil changes, of course I would have some tools.
2813 2018-10-01 18:23:03 There’s just something that oil, vinegar, garlic Powder and salt do to a salad, so good. Simple combo but never gets old.
2814 2018-10-01 18:23:01 Anyone know where I can buy CBD oil for my vape? Lava on lex ave quit selling it so dm me if you can help a girl out !
2815 2018-10-01 18:22:51 To all you oil companies out there, quit being so damn greedy and quit raising prices for no damn reason! Especially in Somerset,Ky.

2820 2018-10-01 18:22:18 but honestly outside of oil changes and tires you slick good forreal. Unless someone just sold you a fucked up car.
2821 2018-10-01 18:22:17 Llenando un tanque de Infinia te deberían dar de vuelto una sucursal de Oil
2822 2018-10-01 18:22:14 I can actually SEE the oil on those things. Damn!

2826 2018-10-01 18:21:37 MEG Energy Corp (MEG) is a Canada-based oil sands company.
It received a hostile bid from Husky and is up 37% this AM.

Acquistions like this show anticipation of bullish futures.
2827 2018-10-01 18:21:32 Those three countries combined are the size of Limpopo Province alone, OPEC sell crude oil that goes through refineries and get transported from cost to inland. In the cost it’s cheap than inland due to cost per killing (cpk). OPEC is a mafia cartel
2828 2018-10-01 18:21:26 Fingers crossed! Oil industry has been good employment for all Canadians! Everyone from across Canada loved the oil industry and came to Ft McMurray!! Have we all forgotten this?
2829 2018-10-01 18:21:25 If you think you’re having a bad day I just poured garlic olive oil all over the mug cake and ice cream I’d made for dessert instead of my lunch for tomorrow which was right next to it 
2830 2018-10-01 18:21:19 People are so fucking stupid. Throwing out oil on the side of the road when autozone recycles it for free
2831 2018-10-01 18:21:17 why didn't Jesus keep living... why didn't he come down from the cross to show people he is more than snake oil?

2833 2018-10-01 18:21:10 Our Viterra likes to know what varieties for wheat also. Malt barley too. Don’t know if they ever check. Metcalf is a higher price than Copeland so I’m sure there have been “mixups”. No one asks about canola other than for yield. Even oil content is very similar
2834 2018-10-01 18:21:07 I never thought I would be this excited about buying 2 liters of olive oil off Amazon Prime, but I am.
2835 2018-10-01 18:21:02 I hope this time Canada protected its fresh water assets... water will be more valuable than oil in the future and Americans waste so much of it..
2836 2018-10-01 18:20:57 Amen
2837 2018-10-01 18:20:54 Playbook remains:  higher oil prices +wages + goods costs from US tariffs, = higher inflation = higher interest rates = correction in prices in weaker names, led by small caps most vulnerable to these inputs to their business models.
2838 2018-10-01 18:20:49 Is it really bearish for prices? 
SPR release --> lower WTI --> higher US exports --> higher crude differentials --> lower US inventories --> Bullish oil?
2839 2018-10-01 18:20:43 His fingers brightly danced along the vial of rain-scented oil. One might describe him — swimmingly — as discipline.
2840 2018-10-01 18:20:41 Oil has gone up to 75.11
Yes that is peaking hey
Try to work it out but definately go conserve time
2841 2018-10-01 18:20:38 Where'd you come from? You look like a nude oil painting.

2843 2018-10-01 18:20:35 i usually take rlly hot shower and let it get steamy then put some euclyptus oil under my nose

2845 2018-10-01 18:20:23 The Rabbit had a red light and a buzzer - not sure the actual intended purpose, oil pressure maybe - that would sound continuously after starting in cold weather, for ~5 minutes until the engine warmed up, then go off like nothing happened. Every day. Ask @Alex_M_Davis.
2846 2018-10-01 18:20:21 NBC dead without ICE car ads. They will always bash Tesla so they dont antagonize their true owners -- ICE and Big Oil. Advertisers own Big Media, not shareholders.

2856 2018-10-01 18:19:19 Best slices I ever had. Visually unassuming, seems kinda normal as you start eating it and then something in the cheese oil bread sauce ratio hits your palate and suddenly you want to run out into Broadway traffic and scream about how good it is.
2857 2018-10-01 18:19:14 The industry must be deregulated. Perhaps we need to build a pipeline from Angola, where the Americans are plundering the oil and gas. What is the actual purpose of AU and SADC if not to benefit the continent.

Another BIG LIE. 2 years after @ProfOsinbajo flagged off Ogoni Cleanup, not a drop of oil has been cleaned. Instead, a maritime university meant for the Niger Delta was scrapped

2873 2018-10-01 18:17:18 I get that, but I've never in my entire life heard a person ask, "how are your chicken wings cooked, can I get them sauteed in lemon and olive oil instead of fried?"

I had witnessed your interview on India T.V. about ethene oil. We are capable to produce ethene oil from the raw materials like municipal waste, rice husk , and husk. Therefore we are intereste
2888 2018-10-01 18:15:53 As if faux-Christian "conservatives" like Abbott would ever pay attention to a message from God. Oil and pollution are what Greg worships, and always will be.

2914 2018-10-01 18:13:42 Maybe you don't know. 3 states in the west are blessed with oil wells too. That the seaports in other regions are not been used is bcoz of insecurity and over extortion from the militants  from those zones. West is more than self sustaining bcoz we embrace(s) everyone.

2921 2018-10-01 18:12:31 India was bold to say that they will continue dealing with I#R#A#N but SL PM is worse than a third grade student. Why not buy the bloody oil through a company established in India?
2922 2018-10-01 18:12:29 I swear Doc Weaver would let us drill for oil in his riding if that was the trade off for #proprep.
2923 2018-10-01 18:12:26 Have you tried it roasted in the oven with olive oil, garlic and chilli flakes - delish xx
2924 2018-10-01 18:12:23 3-“We are diversifying away from reliance on oil to increased manufacturing capacity”

Lie. Manufacturing capacity has reduced 28% from 2015 levels. @Google it. We are dependent on foreign loans. Buhari has borrowed more than any other in our history

2929 2018-10-01 18:11:56 I didn't know about your scandalous claims concerning Vietnam until today. What a disgrace.  You should excuse yourself from the Judiciary Committee.

2931 2018-10-01 18:11:47 Well what if we just gave them back all of their land; the beaches, the oil fields, the minerals, and so on?
2932 2018-10-01 18:11:45 Using available one-time oil money to pay down long-term capital debt, whether it's Muskrat Falls or a new high school makes sense. Difference is Murkrat will be powering the province and generating revenue 100 years from now.

2935 2018-10-01 18:11:24 I really don't think almond butter with palm oil is a great choice. The others don't look too healthy either.

2937 2018-10-01 18:10:53 Just use olive oil.
2938 2018-10-01 18:10:46 We would dampen the influence of a murderous, reactionary terror regime. That's worth any hiccup in the oil markets, which we could counter with sensible policy anyway.

2953 2018-10-01 18:08:51 O/N Wrap:
US equities advanced on word of a the new #NAFTA, as did the CAD and Peso. For a drama that prompted a not insignificant level of turmoil, the resolution was surprisingly low key; oil continued a push to new 4-year-ish highs; NZD support at 0.6600 rebuffed another test.
2954 2018-10-01 18:08:49 No. Not when bipartisanship in this country always means "compromise" that always involves only one side compromising, and it's never the wrong side.

2968 2018-10-01 18:07:09 It’s a monopoly. They obviously change their oil through vacuum rather than gravity and I’d say the dealership are trying to fuck you. If you can’t do it yourself you’ll go to them. It’s a con.

1. DiRECT used Cambridge Weight Plan products not Nestle

3051 2018-10-01 17:58:02 Imbert: Global oil prices kept advancing upwards this year despite the decision of OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers to raise oil production by about a million barrels per day from current levels. #TTBudget2019
3052 2018-10-01 17:58:00 @mkeriverkeeper Once again there’s an oil sheen along the east bank of the Milwaukee River between Wisconsin and Michigan. running south.
3053 2018-10-01 17:57:54 Not really because the FTSEs lower down than, say 100, or 350 go for lesser venues
3054 2018-10-01 17:57:48 It's probably fallen into an oil well then al-lolz

3061 2018-10-01 17:57:03 I love CBD oil it’s outstanding stuff
3062 2018-10-01 17:56:58 As the price of oil continues to rise, Iran undoubtedly will offer discounts to entice consuming nations to buy their oil.  Also, China will become largest single customer of Iranian oil.
3063 2018-10-01 17:56:34 Do you want to order CBD oil or Entourage and save $25 ? Comment below 
3064 2018-10-01 17:56:32 You need plants to grow in empty vegetable oil tins. Every self respecting hut has those.
3065 2018-10-01 17:56:03 I agree; even if we discount the oil, this year Ireland is predicted to grow by 7.8%, UK by 1.4%.  Truly Melissa the most terrifying thing for me is the back room deals being done with US, everyone or most everyone agrees that they will decimate our agri and food industry
3066 2018-10-01 17:56:02 Reading this made me miss my dad lol he just rotated my tires last weekend & gave me an oil change.
3067 2018-10-01 17:56:01 Cuz smart humans know that if we can just burn all that NatGas and Oil reserves... we're gonna be winning again. It's about industry profits... and they'll spend big because the potential profits for the few outweigh facts.

3069 2018-10-01 17:55:48 My housemate wants to see if lube works as cooking oil and I'm not sure if I should be worried or intrigued

3072 2018-10-01 17:55:42 I would love to see who owns all those beach front properties in Indonesia  I see palm oil plantation owners, deforestation drivers, and teak mono crop myopic culture of extinction. So this is war and I am going to applaud Mother Earth for her ability to fight back. 
3073 2018-10-01 17:55:29 Ohhhh I should really buy that fasali oil. I’m not going to lie I have a very hit and miss minimal skincare routine. I generally don’t have problematic breakouts or anything but I would like to reduce small scars/have more radiant skin.
3074 2018-10-01 17:55:27 @matthewogray in CO who represents #frontline #fracking community took campaign money from Anadarko in 2016 & he opposes Prop 112 for a 2500 ft setback from oil and gas activity; whereas he Republican opponent formally endorsed Prop 112. #copolitics #coleg
3075 2018-10-01 17:55:25 Yeah that kind of stuff. When you go with your mom to clean office buildings at night and have to buy a gallon of kerosene because you can't afford heating oil to even half fill the tank. Yes that's the sort of thing. When your housing is very precarious.
3076 2018-10-01 17:55:25 They sit on our oil.... I’d say we should
3077 2018-10-01 17:55:24 The whites would have done a better job navigating this country tho since 1960 IMO,yeah they'd prolly steal our oil and some resources but at least we'd have steady power, better road networks,more jobs, standard healthcare facilities and better general welfare. #NigeriaAt58
3078 2018-10-01 17:55:09 Essential oil people complain so much just so they can be like “I used my said oil and my hunchback of Notre Dame is GONE!”
3079 2018-10-01 17:55:03 Lmao I let my hood up to put oil in my car & a guy said he’d do it & I was like “I got it” 
3080 2018-10-01 17:54:56 Hate that. I'm worried that the scent that I love from @bpal will go away. Since it's a perfume oil I've considered making a stockpile.. though they have so many amazing scents I'm sure I could find another one.
3081 2018-10-01 17:54:44 November crude oil hitting $75 here (+2.5% on the day) on more reports than Iran oil exports are slowing ahead of the Nov sanctions.  #USDCAD negative.  $CAD

Perhaps taking Russian oil after a war 
Really..    anything is possible these days.
3083 2018-10-01 17:54:30 Me too but the "oil reserves under the Artic ice sheet" part does lead some credence to the story.
3084 2018-10-01 17:54:23 Is this one more why coconut oil is used for head massage and applied by our elders
3085 2018-10-01 17:54:21 Jamaican black castor oil
3086 2018-10-01 17:54:04 How does one get the oil off my face
3087 2018-10-01 17:53:55 Ok you never heard of all the animal graveyards and oil and coal plus the universal chalk layer , wether you like it or not these all point to a global flood .
3088 2018-10-01 17:53:55 Why is my car so bossy? Change the oil, air the tire, change filter, curb alert, smoke detected, call 911 ? 
Yeah, screw it, call 911.
3089 2018-10-01 17:53:52 Cause I will face mask & cleansing oil everybody around me to death 
3090 2018-10-01 17:53:45 You should oil your scalp too but I barely did that tbh, I'm super lazy

Facts matter
3095 2018-10-01 17:53:23 No!  Not just me then ... Well there's a thing
3096 2018-10-01 17:53:07 Oil hitting 75 now. Any thoughts on whether it pulls back to some level or goes higher to some level from here? Some unfilled gaps I think around 71. Thanks for your thoughts.

3100 2018-10-01 17:52:46 It's a vitamin b blend with thiamin, folate and riboflavin. If you combine it with st johns wort it's a nice effect. I take both then take a shower, then rub topical coconut oil or topical lavender oil before bed sometimes.
3101 2018-10-01 17:52:41 Of note: "A proposed oil and natural gas drilling operation near the southeast city limit will involve horizontal boring for miles underneath neighborhoods in southeast Loveland."
3102 2018-10-01 17:52:39 me: comes to get an oil change

okei i guess
3103 2018-10-01 17:52:36 i love sesame oil but it is almost 3am and the air in my apartment is RIPE and idk what to do with this
3104 2018-10-01 17:52:31 Most people associate the oil crisis of the early 70's w/Carter but it actually began on Nixon's watch. Carter was one of the only politicians, then and now, who had the guts to tell people to use less damn fuel, and he was vilified for it. We need him now more than ever!
3105 2018-10-01 17:52:25 I caught your guys interview on the view while getting my car's oil changed and you guys were on point to each point. Was so funny. You guys need like a 70's style cher esc netflix special that just doesn't really address anything

3110 2018-10-01 17:51:23 I think you forgot how both City and Chelsea required oil money to become something recently. LFC, United and Arsenal based off from passion and the true meaning of football
3111 2018-10-01 17:51:16 Hair appointment after this oil change
3112 2018-10-01 17:50:59 washington nt gonna do anything abt it .its just pakistan who they pressurise neither they sanction india on buying oil from iran nor they gonna put sanctions on buying s-400.
3113 2018-10-01 17:50:54 I have mine on now, just because my truck was due for an oil change.  Normally I wait until mid October
3114 2018-10-01 17:50:42 腹減ったなあなんか食おう
3115 2018-10-01 17:50:31 @POTUS better watch that oil sneaking up.The middle class can’t stand fuel over $3 a gallon in the Midwest. If diesel starts climbing, everything gets expensive to truck. People will buy less gas and stay home more instead spending to help the economy grow. $70 a barrel or under.
3116 2018-10-01 17:50:30 And if you really want to mimic that Chinese restaurant taste, throw in a teaspoon of sesame oil before the last couple tosses.
3117 2018-10-01 17:50:26 My hair got messed up from life guarding and I lost about 4 inches to breakage. I have been putting in coconut or olive oil. It’s really been helping restore my curls and speeding up growth from that chemical damage.
3118 2018-10-01 17:50:24 &t more US weans off oil, t less Arab nations abundance of oil will cost Americans. U can only frack 4 so long. New tech is needed 2 make a gallon of gas go 300 miles, or green NRG. metals, iron, steel, wood, plastic, rubber, synthetics, chemicals-Scientists need new alternatives

3120 2018-10-01 17:50:14 Crude is at 5500+. Crude is the new oil. I mean, oil is the new crude. I mean, I've no words.

3122 2018-10-01 17:50:10 You have to set a schedule, figure out what foods are best for you (I tend to say low carb is best) and schedule time to physically run around & refuse to let yourself skip it

Vitamin B is a huge help, along with fish oil pills
3123 2018-10-01 17:49:49 Any information about the new petrol pump dealership!? Essar oil is just setting up petrol pump like a tea shop. Government should act soon
3124 2018-10-01 17:49:41 Actually if your read the article the $2.50 discount is from an oil industry recognized source.  The article argues that the actual discount will be much less when changing market conditions for low quality crude are considered.
3125 2018-10-01 17:49:40 Shred kohlrabi + carrot + apple. Fry mustard seeds in olive oil until they pop. Pour over the grated veg. Season with salt & pepper & a squirt of lemon juice.
3126 2018-10-01 17:49:39 BJP has a weak team to break this Anti-India / Left alliance...They all are in deep slumber while their supporters burn mid-night oil. 4+ years is good enough time to instill fear of law.

3130 2018-10-01 17:49:13 3. The cooking itself will then be with little or no liquid at all. The food itself remains juicy due to the moisture in the clay. Also no oil or fat is necessary. Never.
3131 2018-10-01 17:49:07 Have results been reported from the pilot program @BlairKing_ca? At some point pipelines were "a small pilot project" - it didn't mean they should have stuck with transporting oil in wooden barrels on donkeys
3132 2018-10-01 17:49:02 Maybe the large oil companies should invest in renewable energy sources.
3133 2018-10-01 17:48:58 @dharmeshamehta respected sir just a thought that came across and none talk about it. Had govt not been brave and had stopped hiking oil prices at pumps rupee would have been close to 80. That would have been a disaster for the markets
3134 2018-10-01 17:48:43 How can i celebrate Independence when we're not independent??? I fear for this country, the heroes that died who sent them??? If we had it after oil boom or 2000, Nigeria would have been better like South Africa....

3143 2018-10-01 17:47:36 If at this time you still have kins who are trumpist and not conservatives you are wasting time, they are oil floating on water.
3144 2018-10-01 17:47:35 The fact that county A isn't asking for their share ... it doesn't mean Murang'a shouldn't. 

Turkana is getting oil money. Narok gets revenue from the Mara. Kitui is earning from its Uranium or is it titanium? 

AND.. I agree 40% is too high...but there should be some cut.
3145 2018-10-01 17:47:31 And the MVP responds yet again...Yelich with the RBI single and the Brewers up early
3146 2018-10-01 17:47:27 Can be frozen, but needs oil. Even for the chips / wedges... can’t cook without oil as it would be in a steamer
3147 2018-10-01 17:47:26 @dpradhanbjp I hope Essar oil would take over government petrol pumps if they don't add any petrol pumps in the future.

3157 2018-10-01 17:46:26 #OOTT The oil market is simple : it works like black body radiation. Whatever you throw at it, it’ll get back to balance but at a different price/temperature
3158 2018-10-01 17:46:22 Polyphenols content is the only criteria of authentic olive oil that offers health benefits together with deliciousness and has negligible defects to reach complete perfectness as default.
3159 2018-10-01 17:46:22 Before I used to tell my brothers to take my car to the shop and get my oil change or do whatever. Then my brother said YOU go and get an oil change don’t feel like your man gotta do that for you. And ever since I feel accomplished every time lol

3164 2018-10-01 17:45:46 I’d Panko and cook us up in some oil or butter
3165 2018-10-01 17:45:45 Yet, the claim, where almost all suppliers stand for, that lower acidity alone is the main indication for authentic extra virgin olive oil, which is healthy,  is not true.
3166 2018-10-01 17:45:34 Since acidity and peroxide values are defect indices, and they have no relation with polyphenol content. In fact, olive oil with the acidity more than 0.4% hardly provides polyphenols.

3173 2018-10-01 17:44:45 Protect yourself from paying high amounts for unqualified olive oil by looking at fancy presentations and poetic stories in commercial ads, look for polyphenol values written on the sealed sticker next to the brand.

3175 2018-10-01 17:44:33 Olive oil stickers that do not mention about the term ‘polyphenols’ surely have none, so are not eligible.

3180 2018-10-01 17:44:08 The oil for eastern Canada is coming in by tanker, and the oil sold to the US is going by train (10 fold over 2012);  because the Canadian government has not allowed new pipelines to be built. While the safest means of transport is held back, the least safe are increasing.
3181 2018-10-01 17:43:47 It’s only the beginning, thousands of more oil trains are coming.
3182 2018-10-01 17:43:46 Lol I will say ori and coconut oil worked very well for me in my second preg even though my stomach was huge. First time I used palmers and had marks in the 38th week.
3183 2018-10-01 17:43:29 It’s terrible isn’t it. Might bring oil of albas with me or lavender-seriously x
3184 2018-10-01 17:43:29 Besides, if the producers / dealers are not aware of the fact, their product is a waste. Since, the achievement requires knowledge as well as a hand on process from olives on tree to the appearance of olive oil at the end of production line, also in storage, and packing.

3197 2018-10-01 17:42:33 Huge win for FB, Whatsapp & all OTT's getting a free ride with the consumer paying for it. Net Neutrality is not as titled. Its a snake oil movement supported by OTT's and it comes down to an unequal competitive advantage for OTT's over ISP's & MNO's w/consumers the losers.
3198 2018-10-01 17:42:27 I think it’s fine to cook in peanut oil...so long as people know WELL before even entering the gaff that’s what happens there. Its terrible what happened to that young girl
3199 2018-10-01 17:42:15 Those are all different.  Every time the price of anything goes up.  It gets pushed to the farmer. Oil went up so everyone raises their prices but the farmer gets the same.  Wages. Any time an increase happens the farmer pays for it.

The oil money has been spent, Scotland gets more per head of population than any other part of the uk, Scotland with take its share of the 2 trillion debt if it became independant. Austerity in an indy Scotland would make greece look like a pinic.
3302 2018-10-01 17:30:32 Venezuela isn't socialist. Their industry is 70% private and their economy crashed due to a crash of oil prices. And communism is a revolutionary ideology. Socialism is brought about by revolution. That's why violence is often used.

3316 2018-10-01 17:29:46 The principal difference between paints and stains is that true stains are absorbed into the surface of the wood while paints create a protective film, even if it is an oil paint. The product to select depends on the look you want to achieve.

3327 2018-10-01 17:29:08 There is conflect between China and the Philippines about the Spraely Islands and oil there. Only the US Fleet keeping China from drilling. The other thing is populist presidents Duterte and Trump like each other!

3357 2018-10-01 17:25:42 I’ve long thought that. Hyperventilate the economy with tax cuts and big promises, and subsequent admins will have to pay down the debt and cap the blown oil wells, rebuild the international order and lift the fallen bridges, all while being mocked by Trump’s spawn.

3364 2018-10-01 17:24:56 Wow! Price of oil went up to 84.60 today!   It was 70 something the last time I checked.  #brent #forex. Well, the last time I checked was a few weeks ago.

3380 2018-10-01 17:23:33 It would require a lot of discussion, over maps, by experts, like yourself. My idea comes from my neighbour's chap who worked for Shell Oil in the (I think) the scientific department. This was theirs or his findings. You keep sending this to Chris but I'm unsure what he thinks.

3387 2018-10-01 17:22:21 Oil is the only power that Middle East countires have to challenge against USA & Europe. It is time to make higher and higher of oil prices.
3388 2018-10-01 17:22:15 I have been saying for years the Tories (and Labour) MPs have owned Shell and BP shares since Brit Oil was sold off, line their pockets, biggest scam ever. Shell continue to pay one of the biggest dividends in the FTSE. Tax rebates ffs!

*If* they miss, it confirms last year is who they are.

3414 2018-10-01 17:18:51 While it is nice to think Canadians can sell their oil to other countries besides the US, one must be cognizant that countries like India will continue to deal w/ Iran as they will deal in rupees as opposed to dollars; lowest price will always win #ableg #cdnpoli
3415 2018-10-01 17:18:48 I mean I get the point, the oil never comes on shore and as U.K. oil should therefore count U.K. wide. But we really screwed up, which no one would have known or cared about if it weren’t for meddling Norway, being a shining example of how to do it right.
3416 2018-10-01 17:18:46 I never said it would be enough.
3417 2018-10-01 17:18:38 Must not say this after being in power for almost 1 full term.

3434 2018-10-01 17:17:07 I get the popular Canes angle but the Oilers wouldn't be the only team in need or with the necessary space to add a Faulk type. If Carolina doesn't get a half decent return from that setup, it'd be a joke. Kassian on his own isnt nearly enough.
3435 2018-10-01 17:17:06 @dandakich If you want to fill Lucas Oil back up, you do what Reich did. Fans are so eager for any semblance of aggressiveness after years of Pagano. More to the decision than just belief in the players, as silly as that might sound.

3439 2018-10-01 17:16:14 As a Jordanian amigo told me, if Saudi Arabia ever decides NOT 2 accept dollars 4 their oil (or the Yuan gets pushed as worlds default currency), USA is economically doomed 2 a YUGE depression! DONT THINK Chumps belligerence toward China  & the EU cant lead 2 these developments!
3440 2018-10-01 17:16:09 But the point still stands. If we in Westminster mismanage the oil and don’t make much in the way of profit compared to say, Norway, who have less oil (yet are sitting on a trillion quid), then who’s fault is that?

3516 2018-10-01 17:08:36 So in honour of Independence Day I decided to do some catching up on our economy. Apparently oil and gas accounts for only about 9.6% of our GDP but about 87% of our exports and foreign exchange. So oil doesn’t necessarily drive our GDP.

3605 2018-10-01 16:58:41 Sorry. I have it all invested with a Nigerian government official who needed to transfer millions from the late CEO of an oil company. It's a great deal, will make a fortune from it!

3622 2018-10-01 16:56:19 Historically the utility returns were below the oil and gas ROI. And the capabilities quite different. So why should the IOC win and why will their investors accept lower returns? At this point it's testing, not investing ...

3648 2018-10-01 16:53:45 Fall Tip - Remember to check your smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors and put in fresh batteries. A smoke alarm can save lives in a house fire and a carbon monoxide detector can also save lives if a home has oil or gas burning applicances, like a furnace or water heater.

So have you sworn off all fossil fuels? EVERYONE benefits from oil. Investors, workers, and consumers alike. Stop coveting.

US consumers may be cursing rising gasoline prices which are rapidly approaching an average of $3.00 across the nation, but that is nothing compared to the horror that motorists across most emerging markets are facing.
3666 2018-10-01 16:51:44  No. The oil industry is the country's main source of income, which funds social programs. No oil production = no social programs.

3676 2018-10-01 16:51:01 Totally agree, consumers should pay market prices for crops and oil. Artificially reducing prices (assuming your tweet about cash payments to farmers and oil companies is correct) is not right.  Let consumer pay real not artificially low prices.

3688 2018-10-01 16:49:41 Scam is when you raise 1.3lakh crore worth bonds to keep oil prices artificially low and make next govt to pay principal+ int equalling 2 lakh crore. Divide 2lakh crore by 50 (month) i.e whopping 4000cr per month. Right @muglikar_ ?

3756 2018-10-01 16:42:39 Do you mean that some Indian refiners are configured for Iranian crude, or are you assuming all of them are? India already imports more oil from Iraq and KSA than it does from Iran (and has imports from the UAE, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar).

3772 2018-10-01 16:41:12 I stocked up the other day on Charlotte's Web. Oil for me, pills for my mom (back pain) and cream for a co-worker who suffers migraines. My mom is skeptical, but thinks it may be helping, and I have slept tremendously since I started taking it. Dreams are a bit vivid tho lol

3774 2018-10-01 16:40:59 Renaming NAFTA is a welcome change - NAFTA as an acronym never went over well in Spanish as it means flammable oil/naptha/gas. Ironically, in LatAm they call it TLC, when it definitely does not mean tender loving care as in English.

3803 2018-10-01 16:36:52 I think you've hit the nail pretty squarely on the head.  Keep in mind that consumption is clearly trending away from smoking bud and more towards vape pens, edibles and other oil and derivatives products.  So growing beautiful flower at scale may not be that important in the end

3805 2018-10-01 16:35:59 The more Trump says, the more scary it looks. Shale oil will not make it to subtitute Iran production in the short term, and neither global demand in the long term. At least with current almost none investment in conventional oil!

3830 2018-10-01 16:33:37 I didn't know about oil being discovered in the 1950s & i can't argue about that but what I remember very well is the discovery of oil was prophesied in the early 1990s

3885 2018-10-01 16:26:44 Walahi, same here
3886 2018-10-01 16:26:44 Hahahha it was supposed to be a rosemary olive oil garlic loaf and it was probably the densest bread I’ve ever eaten in my life. Room for improvement.
3887 2018-10-01 16:26:39 im just tired
3888 2018-10-01 16:26:35 That was caused by the price of oil crashing. You still living under that rock? I guess you could blame her for that. May as well blame the feds too.
3889 2018-10-01 16:26:28 I don't think a little olive oil is bad.
3890 2018-10-01 16:26:27 When Kukes was involved in the hostile takeover of the Russian Oil Co. at gunpoint, why wasn't his US citizenship revoked? That's obviously criminal behavior.

3895 2018-10-01 16:26:11 PPAC Under #ministryofpetroleum  conformed that the modi government repaid only 3500cr worth oil bond while bond worth more than 1.3lkh cr are still pending #aajatak @anjanaomkashyap  y don't u #debate on this topic I remember patra said humme oil bond ko clear kar diya
3896 2018-10-01 16:26:02 Oil has little to do with fandom, marm.
3897 2018-10-01 16:26:00 And to avoid been sticky add a little groundnut oil. Thank me later
3898 2018-10-01 16:25:59 They just brought it here
3899 2018-10-01 16:25:53 Crude oil price was  $45 per barrel now it is 90 per barrel. The price of petroleum products are increased in all the Gulf countries every month. The price of Natural gas also increased substantially. So the price effect is not only for Indians it’s all over global.
3900 2018-10-01 16:25:41 Same here in my area
3901 2018-10-01 16:25:38 Who said preheating oil in the oven?  (there was a comma)
“Over is preheating, oil is warming up, pan is getting hot”

We make more than just fried stuff lol 

Baked meat, fried meat & pan fried meat.  Go reread the tweet.

3903 2018-10-01 16:25:16 UPDATE: my mom told me her ways of cleaning my shoes.
she soaked them in water and murphy’s oil soap for about a whole day then she washes them with felz naphtha soap :) you’re welcome
3904 2018-10-01 16:25:10 Letting these complicit criminals create their own form of truth and justice is as bad as letting big oil companies tell us solar power is bad for the environment or big pharma that our opioid epidemic is due to lack of a wall.
3905 2018-10-01 16:25:06 That's such a shame though.  That would be such a great insight into what's actually going on.  For instance the mechanics on Lewis' car on the grid on Sunday must have been having kittens about the oil leak.

3907 2018-10-01 16:24:57 Not really true. He scored a career high in points in 2016-17 with Columbus, and tied career high in goals that year.  Can't blame him for being lacklustre in Vancouver.
3908 2018-10-01 16:24:48 Up $OIL
3909 2018-10-01 16:24:44 The way us brits and Americans beef on twitter as if we aren’t out here dominating them oil filled Arab countries together. We should be more like our governments.
3910 2018-10-01 16:24:44 And u dreamt Ghana back to IMF bailout after oil production came to stream as a ‘middle income status’ economy! U also dreamt collapsing 7 banks as a government! Nonsense!!!
3911 2018-10-01 16:24:39 They  gave you ten times the oil revenues through Barnett , you can thank the UK if you like  , pooling and sharing , the Scottish government might start trying to get to a stage where we are putting something into the pot for a change Sam .
3912 2018-10-01 16:24:33 Yes, canola oil makes a great lubricant.

The game on the other hand? hard pass.
3925 2018-10-01 16:23:17 US oil prices have swung wildly thus far in the 21st century.  The low was $1.10/gal in Dec 2001 to a high of $4.16/gal in July 2008. The current price on Sept 24 2018 was $2.93/gal- US Energy Administration
3926 2018-10-01 16:23:16 In ur area.
3927 2018-10-01 16:23:11 Speaking as an Italian whose family make their own olive oil, sadly even the stuff labelled extra virgin is like water compared to the real thing :(
3928 2018-10-01 16:23:08 Would it be heart healthy if sautéed in olive oil?
3929 2018-10-01 16:23:02 The one Sarah Moulton did for epicurious is wonderful - I use the Italian trick of adding pasta water & peanut oil to keep the noodles from sucking up the sauce
3930 2018-10-01 16:23:02 I hope to god I'm missing a joke somewhwere in here...
3931 2018-10-01 16:22:33 Yeah I'm ready to go, been off for 2 years now. Running out of money now lmao. Had the same job for 12 years before, oil biz went bust in 2015 and is just now starting to full recover
3932 2018-10-01 16:22:26 cbd oil has actually turned my life upside lately 10/10 recommend

3934 2018-10-01 16:22:21 I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that we would like you to 1) please start serving in compostable/recyclable containers. And 2) please revisit your palm oil policies. You are among the world leaders of deforestation (that’s a bad thing) and it’s hurting us all.
3935 2018-10-01 16:22:19 Trump can't get his trade numbers straight, won't answer questions re #StopKavanaugh until he finishes his snake oil bull@#*^ re trade, & treats the press like 2nd class citizens while they ask relevant questions for Americans. Be ashamed that he's president! Loco?
3936 2018-10-01 16:22:18 I been using this coconut oil and it’s soooooo good but it kinda smells like ass lmao and I’m like fuckkkkkkk

Coach is not clean full of dirt, oil And bad smelling 
Toilet is choking
3940 2018-10-01 16:21:45 Key takeaway from the $MEG offer? The equity mkt is giving 0 value to oil reserves. As such, it is better to buy them, than explore for them.  Key takeaway from mkt reaction? Mkt thinks it's still right, and that oil in the ground is worthless from a forward looking perspective.
3941 2018-10-01 16:21:23 Oh here’s one o mine! I make it all the time :)
Pound 1/2 cup peanuts (salted) into coarse mix add-soy, a dash chili sauce, toasted sesame oil, garlic, ginger, green chili (if you like heat), lemon juice, a tsp kecap manis, rice vinegar, a tsp brown sugar - either blend or whisk
3942 2018-10-01 16:21:16 Even $19/sh seems conservative if you use diffs of US$20, US$85 WTI. Not hard to get into mid-to-high 20s. Although I guess at $19/sh, one can recycle money into ATH and make even more as oil rallies and diffs narrow. ATH= 2nd derivative play
3943 2018-10-01 16:21:00 Yup, very true.  He has not been good for a long time.

3948 2018-10-01 16:20:21 "oil in the combustion chambers on all 6 cylinders".

Gonna have to pull the motor apart to a short block to figure that out.
3949 2018-10-01 16:20:18 somebody on here just asked if someone has oil for their pen.... who was that?
3950 2018-10-01 16:20:00 I hear you "Oil Tot". I'm tired of fighting two mental illness. #depression and #socialanxiety. It's draining my no energy no absolutely none on reserve. But we Josh Middleton fans love you very much and are here to give you the emotional support you need. Your not alone!
3951 2018-10-01 16:19:55 The US doesn't have to worry about our oil, we can F that up all on our own.
3952 2018-10-01 16:19:49 Thought I could wake up early & get my oil changed. Lmaoooo sike. We aren’t available until 2:30 & I gotta be at work at 3 
3953 2018-10-01 16:19:49 i asked to be in hermit this season and the total opposite happened now my energy died on me

3955 2018-10-01 16:19:34 @Paul_engytrd What are you thinking here on oil ??
3956 2018-10-01 16:19:30 if you’re ever having too good of a day, you can bring yourself back down to earth by eating lunch at a walmart subway while waiting to get your oil changed
3957 2018-10-01 16:19:27 Mnuchin is no Oil painting either wonder what qualities he has that attracts a woman
3958 2018-10-01 16:19:16 Start with Sun noodles, available at H Mart, boil two minutes and then run under cold water; then add black vinegar, a pinch of soy sauce, a pinch of mirin, tahini to taste, tablespoon of sambal oelek or Korean red pepper oil; you'll be good to go.
3959 2018-10-01 16:19:07 Oil prices hit a four year high, with Brent crude trading around $81.30/bbl. OPEC and Russia have decided to continue curtailing production, defying a call from President Donald Trump to ramp up production - The Economist

3962 2018-10-01 16:18:44 Also - why would we want a player that cannot make the Canucks who are a lock to be basement dwellers in the Pacific?
3963 2018-10-01 16:18:37 You certainly will. lol. If he gets just a bit of help, still think 97 can drag them in kicking and screaming. With that said, it is still not a great bet.
3964 2018-10-01 16:18:34 If I had to guess, I think if it was any tougher for Canada, we’d back out of any deal. Even though USA is the elephant and we’re the mouse, NAFTA was already highly favourable of USA. USA enjoyed a surplus, not a deficit & we export the bulk of oil to US just to buy it back.
3965 2018-10-01 16:18:23 Had a great day Heid, couldn’t have gone any better, that’s Deborah and I on my new profile photo, but when we get the profffesional photos I’ll send you the link x
3966 2018-10-01 16:18:22 i’m chilling at the car place waiting for my oil change to be done and this woman came in and started talking to the guy about her car needing some work and all i hear is “i’m going through menopause, nothing makes me cold anymore”... uh... okay hun...
3967 2018-10-01 16:18:17 I'm lost why are you preheating oil in the oven. And. Yes my bad my mind is a bbq kind of mind I prepare meats the day before. But now if we are talking about frying... there are some different processes down there compared to ks.

3970 2018-10-01 16:18:12 You definitely should, it's a very small subreddit, none of the usual drama and active mods. People mostly trade, post pictures of hauls, swap tips, and bond over our shared hatred of anything Lush makes containing cypress oil. It's super chill. lol
3971 2018-10-01 16:18:12 Glad I kept my promise to myself, one and done.  Great event and I am proud I gutted out a 50K finish, but it took a toll on my body.  Hoping I can  finish Oil Creek, this weekend.

3975 2018-10-01 16:17:49 They took the country with the largest confirmed oil reserves, and broke the industry, bringing down production to an all time low, because they fired all competent personnel that didn't follow their ideology, replacing them with party yes men who know nothing about the industry.
3976 2018-10-01 16:17:42 I just found out that the oil man is stopping by the house this afternoon, so we're going to be a little busy. That being said, I'll still stream some Rock Band today at 1:30 (minus vocals) and will make up for it this Thursday at 1:30. Sorry for the inconvenience y'all :/
3977 2018-10-01 16:17:32 WTI trading chatroom update #OOTT :Daily oil price forecast convos were lively during pre-US equity open. The 10 am cst rally did not create angry/abusive commentary suggesting to me that the room took part in it. Some "got out too soon" lamenting by a few chatters.

3980 2018-10-01 16:17:13 Only ones I trust mate. It doesn’t sound like a great deal of money...so...WM should hand over the running of oil revenue to Scotland for pittance that’s out there. Just our luck...oil that’s worthless 
3981 2018-10-01 16:17:07 I gat a question 
1. If corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from vegetables. What is baby oil made from?
3982 2018-10-01 16:16:54 Capital Economics: Although #CAD rose on Monday to a three-month high against the #USD following news that the US and Canada have reached a last minute deal on trade, "we expect it to fall back given the outlook for #oil prices and monetary policy" #forex #cdnecon #USMCA
3983 2018-10-01 16:16:48 #USDOLLAR higher #Gold lower. #Stocks up big on #NAFTA deal. #Goldstocks bouncing back and #Oil up on #Iran fears. #Gold still needs to overhaul 1210/1220 and hold above 1180. Hard to get a direction sense but support/resistance seems to be defined so watch breakouts.

3985 2018-10-01 16:16:32 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
3986 2018-10-01 16:16:29 Creating confusion in minds of common man is that the comfort factor?? Don’t you know the crude oil prices trend. If we want development we need funds & instead of borrowing it from external agencies it is better to collect from taxing on products.
3987 2018-10-01 16:16:09 I would argue that going back to the 1990’s, Texas has done a much better job of diversifying its economy.  Louisiana may never catch up, but it is in everyone’s best interest, maybe LOGA especially, to push for less dependence on oil & gas to fuel our economy AND pay our bills.

3991 2018-10-01 16:15:50 The USDA website seems to be a little lacking in information about what exactly the lemons contain. I'm sure there's a lot of micronutrients the USDA is not keeping track of (Limonoids, etc). Plus skin, oil, pith and seeds contain a whole range of elements.

4004 2018-10-01 16:14:28 For the record, I don't do it, though I've definitely dipped the crust into ranch before. It's... Fine I guess. 

Garlic butter or garlic oil obviously the better option.

4020 2018-10-01 16:13:15 Rich Lowry’s whole MO is making intellectually dishonest points. That he’s extended the practice to a situation where women were potentially sexually assaulted is, quite frankly, gross.

4024 2018-10-01 16:13:11 While vehicles are being produced to emit much lower emissions than when emission testing was put in place, will this stop people from getting regular oil changes which has a huge impact on emissions?

4028 2018-10-01 16:12:38 It's good to read about Mike defending our Social Security benefits & resisting raising age. I'm 61 and still have over 5 years before receiving regular benefits. Republicans think they can raid Social Security for their budget busting tax breaks and oil subsidies. #VoteBlue

4031 2018-10-01 16:12:33 GG, what was your trick with the Jojoba oil?  I got it, never did it and can't remember!  I did have a doctor tell me that if you put it on, and then wipe off the excess not long later your night cream will work better!
4032 2018-10-01 16:12:16 Suman ji kindly differentiate oil and hydro carbon
4033 2018-10-01 16:12:12 My 98 Civic is 20 years old, has 166700+ miles on it, is ugly as hell, has three oil leaks, three loose engine mounts, busted CV joints, and a crummy A/C but by golly it still RUNS--and runs well!
4034 2018-10-01 16:11:56 I guna utk spot treat je, kekadang bancuh green tea, letak setitik dua, pastu buat mask.

Haaa jerawat takmau la tu kat tea tree tu. Try guna benda lain la. Benzoyl peroxide ke, bija ke. Kalau tak pun try guna acne gel yg tea tree based instead of pure oil.

4044 2018-10-01 16:10:38 Our Ministers, MP, MLA, Most of Bureaucrats get fuel free. 2ndly Oil Company People are over over salaried.
4045 2018-10-01 16:10:25 Anytime only saying oil,  oil,  oil, it makes us bore.  Tell other factors except the oil.
4046 2018-10-01 16:10:23 Well it depends, most of the time Methane is there but it's not necessarily 80-90% of Methane in every natural gas source as along as it's conventional oil and gas extraction it's not Methane and it's not dangerous but I'm afraid without knowing it people might protest
4047 2018-10-01 16:10:13 hope bjp realises that thye dont go for divestment then then such new frauds will keep on emerging and they will end up in justifying. anyway with oil at 80+ they cannt increase more taxes so divestment is only solution
4048 2018-10-01 16:10:08 The Federal Reserve starts shorting oil contracts? They seem to feel the need to transform other markets from capitalism to cronyism. Free markets haven't done anything but create the highest ever standard of living so best to get the technocrats at the helm.
4049 2018-10-01 16:10:07 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.

4057 2018-10-01 16:09:44 My favorite one is made with spiralized zucchini. Even mixing noodles with zucchini gives it a nicer texture, IMO. I just wing it--prep the noodles, mix up peanut butter, soy sauce, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, add together, then chop up green onions, and toss.
4058 2018-10-01 16:09:37 Well, aren’t y’all the happy campers.  Solar and wind are the future.  Not oil
4059 2018-10-01 16:09:33 There is a safer way, in the form of bitumen pellets, but we give away our oil at such cutthroat margins that it's not feasable.

4064 2018-10-01 16:08:26 Season meat in the fridge? Explain that process please... the idea is after you season the meat it’s cooked. While you season the oven is preheating, the oil is warming up, or the pan is getting hot. No one ever said to season and let it sit.
4065 2018-10-01 16:08:23 Oh, is Big Oil denying the existence of lava now? I wasn't aware.
4066 2018-10-01 16:08:16 lol wait is krill oil getting bid up now too?
4067 2018-10-01 16:08:00 So @acharya2 opines that, with either the onion or Kumblukay thottu, oil can be smeared easily & in an efficient manner as opposed to wasting more oil using a spoon.

4069 2018-10-01 16:07:58 you might be breaking out because tea tree oil dries out your skin! unfortunately it does the same for me... i actually find sometimes giving my skin a break and only washing with soap a couple times a week helps... i still have acne tho so i’m no professional

The first narrows entrance to Burrard Inlet has a grounding rule which applies to super tankers.  The railways have access roads the pipeline could be built on.

4101 2018-10-01 16:05:26 There’s no chance Europeans are cutting a big oil deal with Iran to circumvent US sanctions. 

Would need tankers, insurance and ports on board, then a European bank to buy the oil. Plus a European refiner to buy from the bank. And they’d get sanctioned.

Iran is screwed.
4102 2018-10-01 16:05:18 Canada allows other countries to haul oil into our country but it’s deemed not safe for Canada to ship oil!
4103 2018-10-01 16:05:14 Eric Dubay shill selling more snake oil to the gullible who are too stupid to know how this soundtrack has been edited? That's my best guess. It is refreshing to see the flatearthers produce some new material even if it is still nonsense. Good effort.
4104 2018-10-01 16:05:09 Cooking with olive oil can be beneficial to your health! Olive oil is packed with anti-inflammatory compounds that can reduce back pain and stiffness.

4123 2018-10-01 16:03:46 "The State owns the oil" is a fallacy. The State receives royalties, calculated as a function of net production, not for “owning” the oil, but as a contingency fee paid for having granted commercial rights to an oil company that succeeds in discovering a commercial reservoir.
4124 2018-10-01 16:03:40 For being most honest youtuber, he is the biggest dumbass that dont get that people especially women would rather use that plant than popping addictive harmful chemicals for pain management.

4168 2018-10-01 16:00:22 Oil prices setting new multi-year highs...Brent crude reaches $84.73 a barrel, the highest since 2014. U.S. sanctions on Iran, limiting the rise in #OPEC output, playing a part
4169 2018-10-01 16:00:17 logged in today to find the oil leak by removing the entire lower shroud.
4170 2018-10-01 16:00:12 When you have mercantalist colonies like Japan, SKorea, Germany, Brazil + middle east oil, I guess it's no wonder..

4179 2018-10-01 15:59:30 Rising oil price is an industry risk. Ryanair may actually do better in that environment due to relatively efficient fleet and stronger balance sheet (Vs. Norwegian etc).?
4180 2018-10-01 15:59:28 The only missing ingredient for a like for like comparison of the 2 scenarios is “time”. How long have oil prices been sustained at >$80 per barrel?

4187 2018-10-01 15:58:43 #FuelPriceHike The same people who are complaining will be voting for the ANC next year. Remember in 2015 when this government sold 10 million barrels( reserves) of crude oil at discount
4188 2018-10-01 15:58:41 Whaaat? Pesto is this paste made from basil, garlic, Parmesan, olive oil, and pine nuts that is really good on pasta or when making a chicken panini.
4189 2018-10-01 15:58:40 You maybe have moved on, but I don't think that feeling is universal. Berman is a handy punching bag to keep the base riled and the oil sands CEOs nervous about losing AB policies they wrote, for all intents and purposes. Smart politics, but factually inaccurate.

4199 2018-10-01 15:57:42 Bhai, you have to check this in laptop; NOT mobile.
Yes it talks about the payment done related to OIL Bonds since 2014; Around 4000 crores only.
Yes it does NOT talk about Iran Dues.
I did NOT dig data FOR that
4200 2018-10-01 15:57:35 Hey we are in for bigger surpises on fuel price...  OPEC has confirmed that oil per barrel is going to be $100  soon.... how much would indians then pay for litre?????? Realistically...... like akshay kumar tweeted in 2014 we should dust off cycles......
4201 2018-10-01 15:57:28 BRENT PRICE rises are accelerating. What happens next?
* Trump tweet

4208 2018-10-01 15:56:39 You can always reduce oil prices by turning down the economy. That’s an odd way to prevent oil prices from turning down the economy
4209 2018-10-01 15:56:28 It's not Ramaphosa. It's the increase of the oil prices. ($vsR) Why won't you guys do your research?

4211 2018-10-01 15:56:19 Seasoning cast iron pans or tawas  involves spreading a thin and even layer of oil on it and applying high heat.  The onion soaks up excess thicknesses of oil and is a nice flat surface to spread the oil around. Bonus - you get a roasted onion to eat at the end of it all.

4226 2018-10-01 15:55:07 Getting my oil changed early this morning and I feel like someone is pressing my eyeballs with their fingers. So tired 
4227 2018-10-01 15:55:03 I don’t think you’d disagree that if the Fed were following your advice, oil might be much higher than it is now.
4228 2018-10-01 15:54:56 Fossil Fuels are not a necessity. They have been made a necessity by the OIL MAFIA. I'd still like government to give an alternate like HUGE subsidies on electric vehicles before they surge these stupid petrol or diesel prices.
4229 2018-10-01 15:54:55 Ah ok I see social anxiety is an issue I’ve had for well over 20 years so I can understand it a lot, do you drink caffeine and what’s your sugar intake like? Both of these massively increase anxiety issues, valerian is a good one too, also do you take fish oil? Omega 3 is good
4230 2018-10-01 15:54:32 #WTI #Crude #Oil pushing $74.50.
4231 2018-10-01 15:54:30 Everything was so cute and we loved walking around! We had brunch at Seasons52, grabbed ice cream at The Bent Spoon, bought olive oil, and had a great time. :)
4232 2018-10-01 15:54:28 Tories are still trying to sell snake oil.
#Chequers means we are even worse off than we are now.
Still in the iron grip of the EU dictators and no say whatsoever.
If Tories think they can fool the 17.4m that #Chequers is #Brexit,
they are in for a rude awakening.
4233 2018-10-01 15:54:21 I ride the D line as well. I liked the guy that doused a bottle of menthol essential oil on himself and proclaimed that his shower was complete.

4235 2018-10-01 15:54:18 not actually true...Guyana never had auctions for its remaining blocks or even plans to auction....the government was considering auctions but any allocation of the blocks will likely be post 2020 and first oil
4236 2018-10-01 15:53:55 I spent the last 2 hours in Starbucks talking with an old petroleum engineer about the history of oil, gas, & propaganda. Time well spent.
4237 2018-10-01 15:53:53 Morons.... we understandthe compulsions... we don't want economy to go for a spin on a/c of subsidizing oil....oil bonds... deficit... downward ratings...its a cascading  effect...

4260 2018-10-01 15:52:11 It’s simple economics. Crude oil price is set in dollars by OPEC, we have no control over that. Dollar price can remain the same, but when our politicians do clever stuff that affects the ZAR/$ exchange rate downwards, then the same oil costs more Rands. 
Who did you Vote for?
4261 2018-10-01 15:52:10 To the oil change guys? 
4262 2018-10-01 15:52:09 Also, you're comparing two different kinds of oil. Ours is cheaper because it's a different type of oil - that's "more difficult to process". No pipeline is going to change that.
4263 2018-10-01 15:52:08 truly better as iced, the regular gets pretty gross when the cream melts and form specs of oil on the drink uhh
4264 2018-10-01 15:52:03 I wonder if there's a connection between Trump's tough stand on the IRAN agreement and the U.S.-Saudi relationship. It would be just like him to make all kinds of side deals (including some that might even benefit him personally) to fully leverage his plan. It helped lift oil $.

4268 2018-10-01 15:51:43 does that tell me that you have always used Palm Oil?
4269 2018-10-01 15:51:39 - Jobless claims in USA currently at a 50yr low!

4275 2018-10-01 15:51:03 In Diario de Debates of 15-II-1941, Pres. Avila Camacho says that the Nation, "as the owner of the oil," should receive the benefits of exploitation. Stop. reboot. The one object of law that is "owned" is the commercial right to E&P. Oil in situ without those rights is worthless.
4276 2018-10-01 15:51:03 As Iroko is a naturally oily hardwood, we would recommend either Treatex Oil finish or Chestnut Finishing Oil 
4277 2018-10-01 15:50:49 I said the same before you were in the oil field

The biggest hit to wages is in the building industry.
4293 2018-10-01 15:49:33 Oil Panic 
4294 2018-10-01 15:49:32 Oh one other thing. OPEC countries have 20 years worth of oil left in their reserves. They plan on increasing prices to $80 a barrel hence the rising fuel prices plus our weak economy isn't helping either.

4324 2018-10-01 15:46:21 Well, yes but the Labour govt of 74 was much more broad church than Corbyn's Shadow cabinet, and the problems the Lab government could be traced back to the oil crisis of 73/74. I supported that government, proud to do so.
4325 2018-10-01 15:46:04 Plenty of oil, just being hidden offshore in tankers.

4341 2018-10-01 15:44:15 Trump is talking like he just saved everyone from the great depression. This snake oil con man is astounding.
4342 2018-10-01 15:44:05 They don't make enough for the whole SAn need. And they can't make their own prices, otherwise the other big oil companies will withdraw from the country, leaving us with an oil shortage.
4343 2018-10-01 15:44:05 They'll settle down when Ottawa offers them billions.   WE all know that in the rest of the country.  How much is Alberta getting for having the oil industry ruined?  Nothing!
4344 2018-10-01 15:43:47 Those 3 games won has hurt the Dolphins even more. Dolphins have to draft a new QB (hopefully Tua). The higher the draft position the better.

4353 2018-10-01 15:42:37 Did NNPC tells anyone that they paid #1.4t of under recovery to themselves? 
Just for your info, NNPC takes 445k bbl of crude oil /day which it converts in swap program. 
It makes money from their to cover part of the under recovery. 
The subsidy claims isn't factually correct.

4364 2018-10-01 15:42:00 That oil has to be refined somewhere, and shipped.
4365 2018-10-01 15:41:59 Oil prices cratered in 2014/15. When Louisiana is too dependent on one industry for both jobs and revenue, it has wide-ranging, long-lasting, effects when that industry struggles.  If La. had a more diverse economy, you guys wouldn’t have as heavy of a burden.

4372 2018-10-01 15:41:33 Stellar reporting! We all know construction contractors hire undocumented workers because they can’t find America citizens to do the back-breaking work. How many of those companies or their contractors are donating to Trump? Other agriculture? Oil & gas? Longshoremen? Hypocrisy!
4373 2018-10-01 15:41:31 Yes we do because you will not take climate change seriously. Not will you accept that oil and gas development is unsustainable.

Colorado deserves better than backwards thinking dinosaurs!

Some place on the East Coast (Maryland?) Doesn't like the corner (of?) brownies. Idk. Some real dummies were polled.
4382 2018-10-01 15:40:50 Hahaha yeah! I use gel moisturizers they tend to be lighter weight, oil free, and fragrance free which should help with sensitivity. As far as serums and stuff goes Drunk Elephant is a good line for sensitive skin just costs a billion dollars.

4401 2018-10-01 15:39:11 So Oil prices is rising and I think may kinalaman ito sa low Supply s a world market means High demand, lower value ng peso since importer tayo ng oil kung exporter sana eh di tiba tiba tayo , vat dulot ng Train and world politics, Us sanctions.
4402 2018-10-01 15:39:02 Honestly that or coconut oil but that gets everywhere
4403 2018-10-01 15:39:01 Agree, but if caq wins I expect theses stocks to follow with a pro oil and gaz gov.
Anyone heard about molson  ready to invest in HEXo?
4404 2018-10-01 15:38:44 I like the idea of better access to cannabis. I love that things like CBD oil are around & that there's a big push on strain variation, medicinal use, and customer information.

I don't like a "bud-tender" named Derek selling weed while black people are still in jail for selling.
4405 2018-10-01 15:38:30 If other essential commodity item&others' prices are under control why we focus so much over it to panic people in society? Have patience. Govt is keen to check its price despite it's price depends on it's international market.M/over UPA govt had taken heavy loan on oil bonds2/2
4406 2018-10-01 15:38:22 A friend brought roasted broccoli and cauliflower to the party last night. It just had olive oil on it. And OH MY GOSH IT WAS DELICIOUS.
4407 2018-10-01 15:38:21 So you haven't been paying attention and are to lazy to do the research yourself? Well, the US is an empire and Syria wants to be an independent nation. For starters. The US is desperate to control the world's oil. And much of US foreign policy is controlled by Israeli Zionists.

4416 2018-10-01 15:37:35 If oil companies funded the preponderance of available climate change evidence, would you believe it simply because there is more of it? It’s time to set aside the •preponderance• argument.
4417 2018-10-01 15:37:29 You are right. In fact India at the height of sanctions never halted ALL oil shipments. It has never brought their imports from Iran down to zero and won’t do it now
4418 2018-10-01 15:37:25 
4419 2018-10-01 15:37:17 Not interested in the snake oil you're selling...
4420 2018-10-01 15:37:11 There’s plenty of money for infrastructure, I’m sure the sovereign wealth funds, pension funds (that are all divesting from oil right this second and looking to put £ somewhere) etc would be happy. Should be a massive renewal countrywide. Borrowing £ never cheaper.

4423 2018-10-01 15:36:54 My current go-to recipe for oatmeal: 

Old-fashioned rolled oats with coconut oil and cinnamon. 

Toppings: gala apples sautéed in ghee and cinnamon with a pinch of sea salt, whole flax seeds, chia seeds, and a drizzle of pure maple syrup. 

It looks and feels like fall in a bowl

4426 2018-10-01 15:36:21 The Venezuelan Petro is not crypto nor crypto asset, even though it's ERC-20 token.  

The oil reserves still need to be verified off-chain by independent 3rd parities, which is not the case.  

Like who would actual believe the Venezuelan Gov't would actually back 1:1? #SCAM
4427 2018-10-01 15:36:12 And, of course, take the oil.

4432 2018-10-01 15:35:26 Chavez was first an aboriginal rights activist. His nations main problem was big oil and the corruption of former Venezuela leadership all resource nations have the issue of predatory miners but worst with oil as in Nigeria. Nothing much done on foreign non oil firms=no socialist
4433 2018-10-01 15:35:19 Rising oil prices are causing trouble to Washington,s anti Russian campaign. Hence the threats and attempts to disrupt pipelines and customer markets. Another headache is the Northern sea route which will make transport far cheaper for Russia and the US wants control.
4434 2018-10-01 15:35:00  so you really want me dead?
4435 2018-10-01 15:34:53 分かります（笑）
4436 2018-10-01 15:34:52 Bingo. The biggest win Trulander could ever have gotten was to facilitate oil and gas to be exported off the west coast and to have energy transported to the east coast instead of them buying it from savages. He's ideologically opposed to that though.
4437 2018-10-01 15:34:44 Busy day for heating oil orders today! Feels like we're turning the corner into the busier period so pleeease, if you don't already, think ahead folks and order before you're down to your last little bit! #dontrunout #helpushelpyou #heatingoil #kerosene

4446 2018-10-01 15:33:58 Th price of oil rose for everyone. Not everyone required an IMF bailout as a result. @UKLabour needed what at that time was a record IMF bailout. @UKLabour always leaves a mess behind due to excessive spending and borrowing leaving us unprepared for a recession. Same in 2008.

4518 2018-10-01 15:27:28 The WORLD is dependent on Middle East oil. I wrote ‘world’ intentionally so you would not reply as you just did. Oil is a destabilizing commodity. Best to use alternatives.

But yes, under Obama, we did increase our oil production dramatically. I bet that irritates you.

4524 2018-10-01 15:27:06 yes. but opening up the coasts helps diversify in the long term. a lot of our trade dependence is structural. even today, it is often much cheaper/easier to trade north-south than east-west. our oil sells at half the price of US oil due to this and this hurts canada as a whole.

4535 2018-10-01 15:26:07 $100 oil price and above would be a huge incentive for SA to push the transport sector towards renewable energy. This would reduce imports and also boost Eskom and renewable projects. This would also protect us more from soon-to-be-inevitable international carbon trade tariffs.

4561 2018-10-01 15:23:59 All reasonable, but they don't demonstrate your hypothesis. I have a fear that the post independence loss of the (min) £7bn fiscal transfer and the volatility of relying on oil revenues for a further £7bn of our annual income, Scotland wouldn't be able to afford to run an NHS.

• Stocks on fire as a result with binds under modest pressure but no new lows
• New move high for oil as Iran again drives prices higher
• NYMEX highest since July 2015
• Tria tries to reassure markets and BTPs do bounce back after poor open
4575 2018-10-01 15:22:43 Call it anything you want.  NAFTA pretty well reduced Canada to a raw materials producing economy for the U.S.A. at initial signage.  Breaking the deal would have meant cutting America off from tar sands oil, wood, and water. Bad deal to Canada then, worse deal now.

4586 2018-10-01 15:21:31 Why is it bizarre? Because part of frying onions is the caramelisation process, which sweetens the onions, and often the frying oil is factored into pasta dishes. And frying onions isn't difficult, so I'm not sure why you'd miss the step out?

4593 2018-10-01 15:21:13 Jeff Flake presents himself as separate from & opposed to the RWA GOP. But his consistent and reliable votes in favor of what Trumpist RWA is trying to achieve suggest that if he isn't part of authoritarian machinery, he is part of the oil that makes it run.
4594 2018-10-01 15:21:10 Especially because a small elite bought all the resources and the real  estate by abusing the FIAT money system. Now they collapse it and their resources become really valuable. And we see that in the last  years of FIAT almost all wars are about oil / other resources now.

Risk of EZ recession is higher than elsewhere.
Many downsides can tip EZ into recession with growth already slowing:
1) $100 oil (EZ big importer)
2) Global trade war (EU surplus a weakness)
3) No UK-EU trade deal

Waiting for the magical gusher update next
4708 2018-10-01 15:09:47 ขอแค่ให้อึนจีโปรโมทนานๆหน่อยก็พอฉันรักเสียงนางอยากฟังทุกวันสักสองอาทิตย์
4709 2018-10-01 15:09:44 Looking forward to the day we r self sufficient in our energy needs.  For the near term sir, pls let us play on the front foot and negotiate for oil contracts at discount. Buying clout should dictate price and not cartels or sanctions!
4710 2018-10-01 15:09:23 Either that or Oil of ain't gettin Olay'd
4711 2018-10-01 15:09:17 Smallest crowd in Lucas Oil stadium history. Looks like the fans want to save some money too!
4712 2018-10-01 15:09:15 my man handles everything with my car oil changes,tires etc ,shit car would have been fucked up cause i gets in and go 
4713 2018-10-01 15:09:05 เฮ้อ
4714 2018-10-01 15:08:53 But he's doing just the right thing. What has the Arab States done since oil was discovered other than trying to satisfy their lust for wealth, wine, & women? They should pay dearly.
4715 2018-10-01 15:08:46 The timeframe from Tory to Tory (eg Rooth,DancingTheresa and Wee Moogy ,take your pick) seems to increase with each gas or oil discovery.I wonder why ?
4716 2018-10-01 15:08:46 I flew back with two cans of olive oil from France successfully (thank god).
4717 2018-10-01 15:08:43 Sir please take a call of oil rates, its highly inflamable political fuel. Public is senti, it has to clarified atleast from top leadership to public reduce the consumption, tax collected by GoI  n other hand state vat to be  levied at specific rate instead of advoleram.
4718 2018-10-01 15:08:41 I thought the tear gas chamber was more of an olbas oil room. It was lovely.
4719 2018-10-01 15:08:35 あ
4720 2018-10-01 15:08:31 Spot on this is like buying an oil company just before a massive find. But no risk of a duster #rms the golden stock soon to move up on profit making contracts 
4721 2018-10-01 15:08:25 They just don't have anything else to do over their in Russia.. I guess it keeps them busy & from wondering why they living in a country with the 2nd biggest oil business on the planet, gas too etc access to worldwide to mkts yet so so poor ?
4722 2018-10-01 15:08:22 Oil bhi tho pi raha hai sir.
4723 2018-10-01 15:08:18 Myself nor my friends and family Won’t eat another cracker til you find an alternative to the destructive palm oil ...
4724 2018-10-01 15:08:14 The National Energy Board Act mandates the NEB set the tolls at a level such that it generates a reasonable return on investment. 

If the oil moves, it makes a profit. That’s the law.
4725 2018-10-01 15:08:08 I was just now reading about Brazil nuts. They're an excellent source of selenium which apparently is essential for good thyroid health. Just one Brazil nut per day. More is not better. Also Nori (and fried Nori with sesame oil, yum) is an excellent source of iodine.
4726 2018-10-01 15:08:03 Myself nor my friends and family Won’t eat another cracker til you find an alternative to the destructive palm oil ...
4727 2018-10-01 15:08:02 Need to go get a oil change.
4728 2018-10-01 15:07:58 Bloomberg: "LNG Canada is set to be the nation’s largest infrastructure project ever, and will be able to send oil cargoes from Kitimat, British Columbia to Tokyo in about eight days versus 20 days from the U.S. Gulf." US lost the deal. Trump lost the deal. I feel sad for you.
4729 2018-10-01 15:07:52 make sure u include how u can join the army and be murdered or have ur legs blown off or get PTSD bc a president decides we need more oil, as opposed to just an army guy standing there w a lot of money.  how is this not brain washing? screen shotting this, nice job.
4730 2018-10-01 15:07:44 Is she using oil of Ugly.

4732 2018-10-01 15:07:41 Yes and we see it everyday.   Moving pipelines.   #lacmagantic 51 people died and yet we cant get an oil pipeline approved that has resulted in zero deaths.
4733 2018-10-01 15:07:30 Vitamin e oil, rosehip oil, African Shea butter, Avocado oil, bentonite clay
4734 2018-10-01 15:07:12 dapat nagpagas na ako kanina. walang kwentang oil price hike
4735 2018-10-01 15:07:06 Fair.
4736 2018-10-01 15:06:55 There is absolutely nothing wrong with a retail investor thinking: “what will happen to my portfolio if govt doesn’t do anything about this NBFG thing for the next fortnight, and oil keeps rising?”. It is, in fact, a sign of some maturity.
4737 2018-10-01 15:06:52 I just bought a cool new hat  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
4738 2018-10-01 15:06:51 じゃあな！
4739 2018-10-01 15:06:40 In 2009 when Obama became president and Nebraska fought against pipeline 

Guess who bought the railroad which now carries oil along that route

4745 2018-10-01 15:06:01 Nigeria no be oil producing state. 
Simply say some Nigerians are oil producing persons (Sanford, otedola, ifeanyi uba and Co)
4746 2018-10-01 15:05:57 Boss u think so myopic... U cant compare water to oil... Proceeds from the later is benefit to all kenyans not specific few

4752 2018-10-01 15:05:20 Social anxiety is exhausting. The amount of work I have to do just to even talk to someone (in person) is overwhelming at times. However, therapy and CBD oil seem to help quite a bit!
4753 2018-10-01 15:05:18 March/April 2019. Unless some Big Oil sovereign fund (Saudi Arabia, Norway) comes to its rescue, as Elon was hoping will happen with his "funding secured". I also don't see anyone like Apple coming to the rescue.
4754 2018-10-01 15:05:17 FAA has authorized oil company BP to conduct drone strikes:
4755 2018-10-01 15:05:14 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil

4758 2018-10-01 15:05:03 If the White House wanted to cap oil prices, Energy Secretary Perry would announce a release of oil from the SPR.  He's not doing that. Which makes me wonder how much the White House really cares about lower oil prices.
4759 2018-10-01 15:04:55 also add a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil in the morning and one at evening before bed if you want to be extra good.
4760 2018-10-01 15:04:49 How about the clip you played of Asad Umar which was from 2015 when the oil was $43 and you played it as if he said it this year, when oil is 80$ and rupee is 126 for a Dollar! Never apologized for it?

4763 2018-10-01 15:04:38 I hear ya, I tried every migraine preventative known to man and was being given vicodin at an alarming rate, so I was super thrilled when cbd oil worked for me! Not sure how well it actually works for pain tbh
4764 2018-10-01 15:04:17 More reasonable for them to step into #hydrogen. It will perfectly work with their service station network, pure charging will clogg them and surrounding streets up. In addition oil companies also source NG, and NG with CCS gives hydrogen. Equinor already pursuing this path.
4765 2018-10-01 15:04:16 Oil & Gas Fracking Projects must be BANNED by all the State Govts as Such Projects DEPLETE the Water Levels in the Region due to such Exploration.. State Govts must take Strict Action against Oil & Gas Firms for Indulging in Hydrocarbon Exploration Which can Deplete Water levels.

4776 2018-10-01 15:03:16 Sir how about "huchellu enne" Niger seeds oil?
4777 2018-10-01 15:03:11 Yes, the other dogs would always be on it if the dog with the gum couldn't reach! Some people use peanut butter, but I found canola oil works best: It doesn't taste great and doesn't have too much of a smell. (That I'm a bit of an expert tells you what a mischievous child I was.)
4778 2018-10-01 15:03:01 Bloomberg: Kuwait oil to U.S. stops for first time since 1990-91 gulf war
4779 2018-10-01 15:02:57 Thinks that don't mix well:
-Oil and water
-Baking soda and vinegar
-Rain and arthritis
4780 2018-10-01 15:02:41 No its not. We've heard it so many times before. The metropolitan socialist is just the latest in a long line of Labour unionist snake oil salesmen promising us the earth.
4781 2018-10-01 15:02:30 If it doesn’t involve a pestle and mortar plus the little “koko” we encounter in pounded yam, then it’s yam porridge without palm oil.
Nice idea though 
4782 2018-10-01 15:02:10 And the flag is the most boring flag I ever see in this world, Oil was discovered in 1956 and you designed this flag in 1959 no single drop of oil were in the flag, all we have is (Green White Green) Agriculture and peace. Master where are the peace and Agriculture?.Shame on you

4784 2018-10-01 15:01:39 Gold diggers dig till they find oil
4785 2018-10-01 15:01:39 Whereas it actually means light in colour & light in flavour because all the impurities that gave it colour & bad flavour have been refined out. Pretty much the same fat profile as any other olive oil though. Cynical/ clever marketing.
4786 2018-10-01 15:01:38 I see. So no butter? No olive oil? No cheese? No cream? No dried meats? Lots of fruit and veg? Nothing frozen?

4810 2018-10-01 14:59:36 So how exactly is keeping electricity "penny cheap" (i.e., affordable) dependent upon using finite sources like coal, oil and natural gas as opposed to renewable such?
4811 2018-10-01 14:59:36 Lol am i your bro?
4812 2018-10-01 14:59:35 No higher taxes required. The biggest tax is the world being dependent on Middle East oil.

4815 2018-10-01 14:59:01 If you converted every scrap of plastic in the ocean to oil, you'd probably get less than one day's energy for just LA. It would probably cost many times the value of the oil you'd get out of it. To save a few turtles and seals? While we're globally still dumping new waste?

4821 2018-10-01 14:58:14 Whatever flaws the EU has from a stance focused on UK self interest this sort of comment from the FS is just pouring oil on the fire & destroying what remain good will we have which is hardly likely to improve negotiations. It’s making no deal seems inevitable.

4825 2018-10-01 14:57:58 THERE IS ZERO NEED FOR ANY KIND OF NEW OIL DRILLING! We have so much oil that the US is now 1 of 4 TOP OIL EXPORTERS. This is about GREED, simply greed. This oil wouldn’t even stay here in the US. It would be exported! #NoOilDrillingFlorida
4826 2018-10-01 14:57:53 We will conduct an “on water” based oil spill response training in Anacortes this Tuesday-Thursday. The drills will begin around 8 a.m. and end around 3 p.m. each day. As a reminder, this is a training deployment only and will NOT involve an actual spill release of any kind.
4827 2018-10-01 14:57:39 He lied about the funding secured. SEC filing today shows an email he sent to his employees. It states they're about to make profit selling tesla cars.  He can not be trusted. He's a proven liar/con artist.  The snake oil salesman of our generation!
4828 2018-10-01 14:57:27 Shame on increasing fuel prices and gas cylinder, 3 to 4 times increased the exsice duty on oil.
Also no measure taken on decreasing the value of Rupees.

4848 2018-10-01 14:55:26 These days the police don't come out and say it was a fuel oil bomb, or plastic explosives as those details aid in interrogation becuase only a person invovled would likely know what was used.
4849 2018-10-01 14:55:10 I can attest to this information. CBD oil has better healing properties, we should not be smoking marijuana.

American team unraveling on Twitter and Golf Channel.  Sad.  @RyderCupEurope @RyderCupUSA @espn @PGATOUR
5002 2018-10-01 14:42:00 เอาไว้ค่อยคุยได้ไหมยังไม่หายดี
รอให้ฉันคนนี้เข้มแข็งสักหน่อย
ให้เวลาเยียวยาหัวใจ
ทำแบบนี้เธอไม่เหลือใครใช่ไหม
เธอเคยคิดบ้างไหมฉันเป็นยังไง
ตั้งแต่วันที่เธอทิ้งไปไม่อยู่ตรงนี้

เพลง.เอาไว้ค่อยคุย

5005 2018-10-01 14:41:37 I'm not sure how other countries prop up their sectors but having grown up on a farm, I know for a fact farmers get federal $ for not growing crops. I also know from friends having worked in the industry, fossil fuels (oil/coal) get gazillions. It's never been free trade.
5006 2018-10-01 14:41:28 Just watched a CNN report. Starving people lined up for hours outside banks. People have died in the queues. Currency is dead. No electricity, running water or food. Doctors operating by lights on Iphones. 5hrs to fuel your car in an oil rich nation. I'm certain it'll get worse.

5011 2018-10-01 14:40:55 Some supports and resistence need break mark not break out. #usoil #oil #crudeoil #oil #oott There is no support or no resistence which is unbreakable. I rather choose certain interval times and certain price marks for SL in this situation not certain number for SL. High waves

5013 2018-10-01 14:40:14 These oil price hikes are crazy
5014 2018-10-01 14:40:13 I feed my dog raw chicken legs with the bones and raw liver and fish oil vitamin powder eggs once in a while. No kinbble. Very healthy
5015 2018-10-01 14:40:11 Endless oil story
5016 2018-10-01 14:40:11 A friend's father worked in the oil business. When he went to Colombia he always flew back with an entire suitcase full of "Colombian Gold" which is to say freshly roasted coffee beans.
5017 2018-10-01 14:40:02 Okay, that game!
5018 2018-10-01 14:39:57 Maybe I’m the water and you’re the oil and we just don’t mix
5019 2018-10-01 14:39:49 I guess when we find oil in Winsted we'll be up there with N. Dakota.

5029 2018-10-01 14:39:05 $88 for an oil change and tire rotation? Way too #expensive @Honda , #honda @AutoNation I pay less than half of that for my #Jeep @jeep
5030 2018-10-01 14:39:04 The timing on this #FuelPriceHike is well calculated. This Rand decline and oil increases is just a story.
5031 2018-10-01 14:38:57 Sounds like snake oil salesmen to me.

5044 2018-10-01 14:37:10 What a mess! I don't know if the traditional cooking-oil-rubbed-in-the-fur-and-pray-the-dog-doesn't-eat-it-before-you-comb-it-out technique would work, but it's done wonders for my dogs when I was a kid (when the dogs didn't lick it off).
5045 2018-10-01 14:37:05 this is the only way that Iran could save it share in oil market.
5046 2018-10-01 14:36:59 Can CBD oil become legalized already? It would really really help Jeda with her epilepsy. I’m sick and tired of phenobarbital and all the side effects that come with it! #CBDForDogs
5047 2018-10-01 14:36:53 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.

5054 2018-10-01 14:36:16 Good morning! I'm excited to announce that CTFO (my CBD oil company) has unveiled some new products! Contact me for more information.

Icing: heavy whipping cream, sugar and food coloring if desired.
5056 2018-10-01 14:35:55 $AMRN $3.00 to over $18.45 seems kind of laughable on FISH OIL lol
5057 2018-10-01 14:35:46 (1/2) Nigeria's approach in oil and gas has some positive results, as has South Africa in mining historically. The problems that come up do not stem from the policy so much as the governance (corruption, etc), which would affect any policy or sector approach.
5058 2018-10-01 14:35:38 Man there needs to be a service that comes to YOU to change your oil or they pick your car up 
5059 2018-10-01 14:35:33  get another oil change
5060 2018-10-01 14:35:31 As soon as the oil industry sees the fall in revenue they will switch. It's just getting to that tipping point.

5083 2018-10-01 14:33:43 What kind of benefits are you seeking? Cbd oil has a laundry list of benefits from anxiety/depression relief, pain, sleep, anti inflammation, neurogenesis, and just overall well being. I myself take it for anxiety and insomnia and it’s changed my life. Try it!

5085 2018-10-01 14:33:25 Just a theory. Big Oil knows the jog will soon be up as climate damage become unignorable. Raise prices, rake in the cash, bail out with 8 figure retirement package when the industry implodes. Retreat to secret lair in New Zealand and live like gods.

5100 2018-10-01 14:32:07 Spicy is good, as is the beef. I rarely stray from those two, as all the other flavour is added through extra gubbins. Usually extra meat, a soft boiled egg or two, spring onions, and a bit of chilli oil.

5106 2018-10-01 14:31:32 "WHY DOES A TRADE DEAL NEED TO DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND INDIGENOUS RIGHTS?!?" 

Yeah I guess the oil trade, which is a big part of this deal, is in no way affected by those things
5107 2018-10-01 14:31:20 I happen to own and operate a coconut oil factory. Feel free to pop over
5108 2018-10-01 14:31:12 I put peppermint and tea tree essential oil in my lotion and my body has been tingling non-stop for the past 5 minutes. Every single nerve on my skin is being electrified. I'm never getting dressed.

5135 2018-10-01 14:29:10 In other words, nobody is talking about nationalizing the oil companies.

5146 2018-10-01 14:27:36 I wish you good luck in your election campaign.  I spent more of my life in your district than anywhere else and was born in California.  Being an engineer in the oil business was hard there and basically we were driven out of the state by overzealous regulations.

5151 2018-10-01 14:27:13 these that my grandmother made were nothing healthy -- grilled in oil, loaded with eggs -- you would of course top with real butter. so darn tasty though
5152 2018-10-01 14:27:06 My dad told me about cod liver oil. Not that tasty.

5161 2018-10-01 14:26:17 You also would probably really like the Oskar renaissance cleanser - it’s like a gel-to-oil consistency which I love, but not cheap. Sounds like TTDO would be ideal for ya :)

5165 2018-10-01 14:25:44 No chance in an economy based on the oil industry second only to war in environmental degradation.
5166 2018-10-01 14:25:38 Thanks, this is one of the things I was emailed, but does that actually mean it is completely oil free, or just mineral oil free?
5167 2018-10-01 14:25:32 For 7 years, the US has pumped more #oil & #gas out of the ground than any other country. US nat gas production stole the #1 spot from Russia in '08 & exceeded Saudi Arabia’s production in '13. ~ @qz via @MarkZinder
5168 2018-10-01 14:25:32 Still beating myself up for at least not top slicing. Held from the highs and now sitting at breakeven. Should have applied the same principles that I do after an oil co makes a discovery...sell! Still very confident from here, but feel 2019 will be the year.

5172 2018-10-01 14:25:21 Sorry, what part did Braid get wrong? Seems you are both basically saying the same thing.  I mean landlocking Alberta oil is cool in Canada.
5173 2018-10-01 14:25:06 Very strange syntax but the West with Turkey, KSA  and other Gulf countries sent in their jihadi headchopping cannibalistic drug addled crucifying mercenaries to destroy a secular country for oil/gas/geopolitical ambitions. The UN are useless.

5180 2018-10-01 14:24:32 To be completely honest, I have never liked Reed.  However, after hearing the aftermath, to use an analogy, it seems that Reed/Spieth were dating, then along comes Spieth's dream girl Justin Thomas. Spieth says see you later Patrick.  Reed is spurned and acts out.  Who is guilty?

5185 2018-10-01 14:24:04 Just to reassure your followers - this is a refined olive oil, not an extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) which has a more pronounced bitter olive note - some people don't like the flavour of EVOO and some dishes work better with a more gentle flavour.

5195 2018-10-01 14:22:50 some that i have enjoyed over the last 2ish years: superfacialist vitamin c oil, sanctuary warming cleansing balm (esp nice in cold weather it literally WARMS AS U PUT IT ON), ultrabland (not as good at getting off make up as the others), emma hardie moringa balm (tho it's £££)
5196 2018-10-01 14:22:50 and this selling "children" into slavery will be going for 50 years, long after Putin death - next russian generations will be forced to provide free oil into China for nothing, at our expense. This historical shameful contract Putin made top secret, but the details leaked.
5197 2018-10-01 14:22:41 Would that blending hydrogenate the coconut oil?

5206 2018-10-01 14:21:06 Jojoba oil is the best moisturizer for your face. Its the closest oil to your skins natural oil so it wont cause you to make more oil or cause dryness. I would choose one or a few essential oils and add then to jojoba oil and apply it to your face when its clean..

5220 2018-10-01 14:19:46 We all care about climate change, minister, most of us anyway. However, Canada's contribution to world GHG's is insignificant and much of any excess is due to our production of 3 million Barrels/day of oil for USA.  Improve air quality, sure, but CO2 reduction is pointless
5221 2018-10-01 14:19:44 That's a broad brush you paint with. I now a lot of intelligent people who are Trump people. They voted thay way because of the snake oil salespeople on the other side.

5222 2018-10-01 14:19:39 "acquired property" 

You mean like the US acquired property from the natives? Or how Bezos acquired property definitely not using the privilege of money he was born into? Or how company after company acquires oil rich property in the middle east? 

Capitalism is violence.

5231 2018-10-01 14:18:26 it's quite strange organization considering the situation of loans between Russia & China, quite serious conflict - for example Putin like 3 years ago basically signed an oil-transport contract where Russia selling it's oil not for free but also spend money on tubes, like slavery

5289 2018-10-01 14:13:01 The "next phase" should actually be a few years away, I am like... twenty four. 
I think I went overboard with my attempt to keep my skin oil free and something messed up but I can't figure out what it is.
5290 2018-10-01 14:12:54 Actually, many things were built when d nation made more money, during d oil boom - Eko Bridge, National Theater, Tafawa Balewa Sq, Festac Town etc.
d city has since grown past that, with d city developing so much even beyond its limited land mass into Ogun State

5296 2018-10-01 14:12:13 Us oil companies want higher prices. When the price gets low they can’t afford to drill.
5297 2018-10-01 14:11:59 Nah, I think they were always like that, it's just coming out now...
5298 2018-10-01 14:11:49 Oy! you sent me a Fresian I wanted a Jersey

5307 2018-10-01 14:10:46 The trade deal changed very little fo Canada overall. However it appears Canada is pursuing other trade deals with the EU & other countries. Canada is building a pipeline to the West Coast tofill up Chinese & Japanese tankers with oil rather then send the oil to Texas Refineries

5321 2018-10-01 14:09:08 The Oil prices r increasing every day. Pl focus on this immediately else returning to power seems very tough
5322 2018-10-01 14:09:06 Just like with Venezuela, the untold story has to do with these nations' offshore OIL, and how U.S. OIL'igarchs seek to seize and profit off of it via clandestine interventions, boycotts, sanctions, fiscal contraints, regime changes, puppets. As always, follow the mammon.
5323 2018-10-01 14:09:05 Your problem is that you're trying to use logic while also trying to understand Democrats. Logic and the left are like oil and water.

I still used vitamin E oil generously all over even after I had him and it helped fade them a lot! Also apply it to more than your belly. I put it on my thighs as well to help

5347 2018-10-01 14:06:54 Record harvest is good for more people than lower gold and oil prices combined.
5348 2018-10-01 14:06:49 He’s a terrible judge.  He rules in favor of billion dollar corporations over American citizens every time.  If you sue Exxon cause they dumped an entire tanker of oil into your bedroom, you better hope you don’t get Kavanaugh as your judge.  He’d find it was your fault.

5364 2018-10-01 14:04:40 We watched that SNL video in class this morning (it had nothing to do with the class and I still have no idea why our teacher showed it to us). After two or three minutes I thought the oil baron seemed familiar......then came the horrifying realization.
5365 2018-10-01 14:04:30 おわおわり
5366 2018-10-01 14:04:28 I wonder how much of that electric goes towards pumping, transporting,  and refining that oil?  The oil industry is very energy intensive if we used that energy to power electric vehicles it would offset much of predicted need for more energy production to power our future.
5367 2018-10-01 14:04:27 My formula for success? Rise early, work late, strike oil.

5368 2018-10-01 14:04:24 2012-14 period had interest rates ballooning and crude oil prices which directly bear on bitumen and hsd. Steel and cement were also no cheaper. As concessionaires the price escalation risks were borne by ILFS itself. Macroeconomy and policy paralysis can't be discounted #Context
5369 2018-10-01 14:04:17 The ANC cannot control crude oil prices, but they have mismanaged the economy, allowed corruption to erode public money and investor confidence, and must take RESPONSIBILITY. You, and you only, is the problem. And you know it.

5394 2018-10-01 14:01:45 Krill oil is superior in many ways, to conventional fish oil. It contains 50 times more of the powerful antioxidant astaxanthin, along with beneficial phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine that you need for optimal cellular, hormone, brain, and nerve health.

5400 2018-10-01 14:01:28 The government should just give out for how much is it buying crude oil, how much is it spending on it, how much is the tax and all the other details in public. This will put an end to the controversy.

5404 2018-10-01 14:01:16 I wonder how a policy paralyzed, corrupt govt which was run on remote control gave us avg GDP growth 8.2, even they had not earned much from petroleum products. But This govt couldn't able to reach that figure with lots of money earned from tax from oil.

 So who is corrupt?
5405 2018-10-01 14:00:50 Is there a reason why Chapter 6 of NAFTA on Canadian oil and gas is still fully intact in NAFTA? I would have thought that access to Canadian energy would have been a massive bargaining chip.

5418 2018-10-01 13:59:26 Just like the waters feed the jungles of the world,  the oil feeds the concrete jungles of the world, our petro-economy is really a petro-ecology, too much is built on it

5436 2018-10-01 13:56:24 I think mr president buhari and cabal are selling us into another colonialisation in their bid to hold onto the crude oil resources through the utilization of the chinese military/political machineries thereby keeping the geographical entity called Nigeria together by force

5441 2018-10-01 13:55:46 Totally agree. Get Faroes to join too and we would have the vast majority of North Sea oil and gas reserves, the world’s 5th largest economy, the world’s largest sovereign fund, and world leaders in banking and finance.

A very solid and attractive counterweight to EU.

5453 2018-10-01 13:54:38 So it’s alright for sask and ab oil to be discounted immediately after crossing the border , yet it should not apply to grain and other imports coming the other way. Makes sense
5454 2018-10-01 13:54:32 Trumpers & facts are like oil & water.

5456 2018-10-01 13:54:28 I completely agree. We should learn from Australia as how they treat the minorities. Now some dumeels will come and say, why we do buy oil from gulf countries, I don't think Iran or Saudi Arabia stops my vinayagar procession or any other hindu festivals in India.

5522 2018-10-01 13:46:42 What is a leftist?

My point is that the oil rich states are the ones who determine the fuel price to a larger extent.
You can replace that word(control) from my earlier comment if you like.but that was a question though.
I wonder why you seem to be allergic to the word CONTROL

5542 2018-10-01 13:43:58 No political party will be able to solve the problem.

5558 2018-10-01 13:42:42 from my small sample size, I do think fish oil helps the skin and eye dryness.  I think CVD is caused by nutritional problems from depleted processed foods which crack the blood vessels.

5714 2018-10-01 13:27:36 Why do we need Canadas oil. It is sand based an epensive to refine and on top of that the US has plenty of oil enough to compete with  all the other oil countries possible more oil than they have
5715 2018-10-01 13:27:35 Giving farmers BILLIONS every year, is a handout. We give big Oil $37.5 BILLION in subsidies every year. You OK with that but not helping the poor?

5736 2018-10-01 13:25:10 Rupee weakened against the US Dollar today as foreign banks placed long dollar bets fearing further fall. Elevated crude oil prices also dampened sentiment. Importers' dollar demand weighed on the domestic currency. The Rupee ended at 72.91 vs. previous close of 72.49.

5741 2018-10-01 13:24:34 I have been there, what some times helps me is putting a few drops of lavender oil on a tissue then stick it just inside my pillow case. Or even try a cup of sleepy time tea made by Celestial seasonings.

5776 2018-10-01 13:21:32 The economy has always been diversified, what has remained undiversified is government's source of revenue...we still largely depend on crude oil. 

And where is the massive infrastructural development? With what funds? Where government is even borrowing to fund recurrent?

5851 2018-10-01 13:15:24 In the oil market, balance is a difficult game. Calculating whether the 100 million barrel per day world market is likely in the months ahead to have a surplus or deficit of supply, or be balanced, where supply equals demand, is never simple.

Please give me money!
6009 2018-10-01 13:00:36 Okay, that article is such bullshit. Any decent massage is a lymph draining massage. And I know that’s not your point, but that’s how people get bilked into paying $90 for the $30 massage but with lavender oil. So the author is either incompetent or she’s cool with the scam.
6010 2018-10-01 13:00:36 I think #EFTA is a very exciting opportunity. With UK the dynamic would change. EFTA would have the 'safe' oil and gas reserves in Europe. We have untapped shale and tidal - learn from Norway and Iceland. Also Swiss not happy with EU, we could work together.

6026 2018-10-01 12:59:27 I agree that it should be regulated, if it is to be successful and steady. As an American, I have concerns that, eventually, the Dollar may lose its prominence on the world stage (i.e. oil trading). My concern is, like yours, if US regulated, others wouldn't follow.

6055 2018-10-01 12:56:00 Electric vehicle sales are on pace to overtake internal combustion engine vehicles by 2038. Since majority of oil production goes to fuel production, demand for oil will continue to decline. Why would anyone invest in a dying industry?

6060 2018-10-01 12:55:16 The prices maybe a bit expensive but I can tell you that those items listed are necessary. Many don't even know that a set of good spark plug is about 18,000 but only changeable at every 50,000km (sometimes up to 70,000km). A substandard oil filter can cause damage too
6061 2018-10-01 12:55:15 If those oil volume numbers were marked to oil market price it looks a bit different. Note that the 2009 collapse in import values followed a colossal $ price fall

6063 2018-10-01 12:55:01 Olive oil is pretty good as well but you also need to figure out what works best for your body. The double advantage with water is that it lines the tummy and makes you use the rest room frequently so you get rid of both the alcohol and the water. Olive oil only lines the tummy

6145 2018-10-01 12:45:47 It took a few years for US shale oil to ramp up funded by post-2009 petrodollars. Looks like US substituted other origins for Canadian oil on a big scale from 2009 onwards

6263 2018-10-01 12:33:10 That market for long time had a crazy delivery rate - i.e. it seemed to be more a vehicle for buying and selling physical oil than being a true derivatives market for transfer of risk.   I have to take a look at that.

6279 2018-10-01 12:30:51 I instantly regret it a few seconds later. Even when you wash your hands the oil lingers on your hand and yeah I thought it was washed off...
6280 2018-10-01 12:30:50 I agree with Brian. These same guys are also responsible for undercapitalizing rural communities and teeing them up to serve as sacrifice zones for oil and gas extraction.

6314 2018-10-01 12:26:38 I’ve got a great idea, why doesn’t the DA drop a line to OPEC and if they don’t ask “who the f&@k is this” then tell them to drop their oil prices immediately, because the DA doesn’t actually have a plan for running the country, but they are good at telling people what’s wrong???

Of course if governments around the world ended their subsidies for oil companies and other fossil fuels, they’d be considerably more expensive anyway

Repayment of UPA 2's Oil Bonds = 3500 crores

3. engineering disruption can solve real world problems.

Cow Ghee/ Home made ghee is the best type of ghee.

6428 2018-10-01 12:15:43 Pl check fiscal deficit ... in your so called Maan-Mohan period and 2014 onwards, which is real gauge of country economic health, since 80% oil we import, so ur logic is as good as of papu !!

6445 2018-10-01 12:14:05 It means countries whose budgets are heavily dependent on oil will finally get some respite. They can now deal with budget deficits or shore up their sovereign wealth funds. Should be a boon for Zim based on the chatter we are getting from Mzarabani!

6480 2018-10-01 12:09:36 0.82% is plausible at this point in time in the Nigerian economic history. For a country that is trying to recover from recession, detaching from solely oil revenue and implementing a diversified economy system, it is expected.

6624 2018-10-01 11:49:11 Not all of the oil and gas in the UK is produced in Scotland.

GERS shows exactly where oil taxes come from. Current tax take does not cover our spending.

Are you advocating getting rid of Barnett and wacking up taxes to cover our expenses or do you want to control spending?

6646 2018-10-01 11:46:57 It's  the same NAFTA; changing it's name is an old snake oil trick, considering that the US exports to Mexico & Canada represented the largest % of US export trade, with the US enjoying a surplus with Canada.
6647 2018-10-01 11:46:49 1) Oil might be the culprit, at least directly after 2008. Oil prices plummeted. This price decline accounted for almost all of the overnight 3% of GDP decline of the current account deficit of the USA around December 2008.
6648 2018-10-01 11:46:48 El putibex subirá cuando despierte TEF y los bancos, osea los que más ponderan. Yo diría que la clave de subida de tipos del BCE la tiene el Oil vía inflación y ahí despertaría la banca.

6650 2018-10-01 11:46:25 We aren’t protecting the oil for just us, you can’t see that? We have our own oil, gas and coal. That is the facts. You wouldn’t know Facts if hit you in the face.
6651 2018-10-01 11:46:21 Apart from petroleum, Nigeria's other natural resources include natural gas, tin, iron ore, coal, limestone, niobium, lead, zinc and arable land. The oil and gas sector is highly dominated,while others are under explored. If only it wasn’t, Nigeria will be a better nation.
6652 2018-10-01 11:46:17 I’ll be glad when I get an oil change.... I’m doing what I need to when I get paid not what I want to going back to being conservative CAMPBELLSVILLE STYLE 
6653 2018-10-01 11:46:14 This is the sort of thing that makes the sale of snake oil look like a respectable business.
6654 2018-10-01 11:46:07 Wasn't this problem due to oil prices rising?
Combined with the UK's policy of paying off war debt rather than investing in infrastructure. To the same degree as other countries. America had taxed wealth more heavily, France confiscated industries from collaborators.

6658 2018-10-01 11:45:37 Yeah, but US production picked up massively and the US deficit in oil has basically disappeared.
6659 2018-10-01 11:45:33 Prices will go up or down depending on the price of crude oil. And exchange rates will play a part but SA case is truly special. If I recall the national budget has a rather large deficit... At least that's what I remember when Malusi was rapping "it's gon be alright!"

Right under his nose they will sell the country and he won't know.Diezani's oil deals are still a shock to him.Isn't there someone else?
6719 2018-10-01 11:37:25 Also, no, the planet cannot be “saved,” merely kept alive a bit longer.
Oil wells run dry. Hurricanes run rampant. Overpopulation and starvation is everywhere. The seas rise and cannot be stopped.

We have to leave this planet some day. You cannot stop the inevitable.

6824 2018-10-01 11:25:15 New oilfields? And how much revenue do think they will bring? You do know that the only revenue from oil,that the state gets is from tax on oil companies? Don’t you? And that Osborne slashed that tax after Swinney begged him to do so when the price plummeted? Perhaps you don’t.
6825 2018-10-01 11:25:04 Thats not entirely accurate.  Much of the byproduct of what is grow for humans, goes to animals.  For instance, about 90% of soy is pressed for oil first (for humans) and the leftover meal is fed to animals. 1/2

6836 2018-10-01 11:23:46 Strange that the BBC bothers with the tory conf.: just the same old snake oil as always. Nothing new; nothing of intellectual interest. @bbcpointswest @BBCNews @BBCNewsnight @BBCPolitics

6839 2018-10-01 11:23:29 So....bear with me. IF ALL oil revenue went to an independent Scotland...and none of that revenue went to the WM...maybe that’s what the billionaire investor was meaning when he said the UK would fold? I mean currently we’re getting the scraps eh? 
6840 2018-10-01 11:23:04 Mostly I just look at the ones that are standing on the fence yelling you know it's like the squeaky wheel they're the ones that supposed to get the oil this time they're not getting the oil they're going to be towed off of the fence on their backs hope they can't get up

6867 2018-10-01 11:18:52 If you read GERS or PESA you can see that our share of UK oil and gas is accurately assigned to Scotland.

We get all of the revenue from taxes on profits from oil that originates here.

The oil companies use fiscal meters that have to be verified for tax and partner sharing.

6871 2018-10-01 11:18:22 That is beyond belief, she just stands there like a dummy and says nothing. Endogan is a corrupt dictator and a supporter of Daesh who enriched himself by buying their oil. Merkel should have told him these things do not happen in a free country.

6894 2018-10-01 11:15:26 This means no room for growth in oil sands, and a gradual decrease over time. Shipping out diluted bitumen isn't a job creator in the 21st century.

6904 2018-10-01 11:14:13 This proposition only works with a high enough carbon price that oil sand products are unaffordable. Sure a carbon price is needed but if it's too low then a ban on the worst fossil fuels is needed. Either way there's no future for oil sands.

7061 2018-10-01 10:51:47 Nigeria is the 12th largest producer of crude oil in the world, and the largest oil producer in Africa.

7267 2018-10-01 10:14:07 Quarterly earnings, crude oil prices, currency trend, state assembly elections and global cues would be the factors driving the market. Apart from this, resolutions of the problems in the NBFC space would be an important factor to look out for.

7391 2018-10-01 09:52:08 Nothing other than emotionally satisfying righteous indignation will be gained from all this if no institutional reforms has been done to shield oil field allocation from discretionary whims of a revolving cast of politicians and Hunchos of the state owned oil coys...
7392 2018-10-01 09:51:53 They need high oil price now for survival. Who cares 20 years down the line. Need money now.

7401 2018-10-01 09:50:54 Renewable energy is shit, hydro excepted. There are only five viable ways of powering civilisation on a large scale. Coal,gas,hydroelectric, nuclear and oil.
7402 2018-10-01 09:50:49 Excluding oil and erratics (mainly gold flows), growth in goods export volumes shot up after the depreciation. The three-month y/y rate rose from -3.9% in October 2016 to +12.5% in September 2017. That's disappointing?

7419 2018-10-01 09:47:45 Russia PMI at exactly 50  - no acceleration or deceleration in growth. Input inflation seems to still be an issue (devaluation and high oil), but optimism is highest since 2013! Still see some legs on this short cyclical downturn.

7427 2018-10-01 09:46:33 Oh, and our strategic oil reserves of 10 million barrels of crude oil were sold illegally. The aim of this supply is to protect South Africans from sudden increases in the international price. Hence we have to carry the burden.

7441 2018-10-01 09:44:15 Hi @NorthernTanks,  a few days can make all the difference in cold weather and to have some extra oil is always a good idea for emergencies. For example, The Beast from the East caused issues this year with oil deliveries reaching homes late due to weather conditions.
7442 2018-10-01 09:44:09 My suggestion is soups with good quality stock, no beans, no pasta, no rice, no bread, reduced sugar (no fruit, jams, etc), eggs, meat, butter, olive oil, spices & all the veg you want with lots of chilli, garlic and ginger. And to get as much sleep at night as you can.

7451 2018-10-01 09:43:15 No, indeed it's worthless
this will not happen tomorrow or the day after
realty is:
1- China started giving PARTS of the loans in yuan to countries
2- EU started a long time ago regarding Aid 
3- Iran & some others selling Oil in Euros 
But what will happen if more will do this!
7452 2018-10-01 09:42:48 It's another contradiction of the Leftists - Feminism and Islam is like oil and water.

No movement in kerosene price in areas under state of calamity. These reflect movements in the international oil market

Obviously the smell of fear from losing that oil will emanate from the treasury already struggling with the bill for #brexit

Just another tory out its depth disrespecting Scots & trying to block democracy

7671 2018-10-01 09:10:18 A lot of talk about #oil prices going up recently, with some suggesting $100 per barrel. Here are the top 5 crude oil exports by country

#Iraq  $61.5 bn
#Canada  $54 bn
#UAE  $49.3 bn

So true?
7728 2018-10-01 09:01:15 then for A4aii. Crude oil fractions are short-chained hydrocarbons which are obained through cracking of crude oil (long-chain hydrocarbons). Cracking crude oil produces a mixture of smaller fractions which are more useful in the oil industry (actually tbh im not sure)
7729 2018-10-01 09:01:00 That can't be right. The experts were telling us 20 yrs ago that the world had reached 'peak oil' and we'd soon be running out.

7809 2018-10-01 08:46:19 So yes, Oil prices have been rising steadily. But only since Jan 2016. And it is not correct to say that Oil price is now $20 less than than 2014, because the 2014 price should be taken as the CLOSE of 2014. Which was $53. And today oil price is $73. So it's actually $20 higher.

But for Oil Money there will be a perfect solution from some Hadith, manipulated by some Mullah N said ad verbatim by the "Believers"...Interest is a gain received on the hard earned money of any individual including a Muslim..

7826 2018-10-01 08:43:21 Well... to be fair, 2014 was a year of huge volatility in Oil price. From USD98 Jan 2014 to USD53 Dec 2014. Currently it's at USD73. I'm talking of WTI Crude here, the US Oil spot price. So it went down to USD27 in Jan 2016 and it's been rising since.
7827 2018-10-01 08:43:14 Is that the year the oil runs out :)
7828 2018-10-01 08:42:35 yes it's a leave in conditioner. And I applied oil RELIGIOUSLY this week

7837 2018-10-01 08:41:39 Yes I sgree its relative EXCEPT oil is a commodity, costs the sane everywhere. The price difference is TAX AND EXCISE DUTY. Airlines buy fuel for 10% of price motorists pay. Is that unfair? In Europe AVGas is 10c/litre but it pollutes sane as a car
7838 2018-10-01 08:41:39 It is extremely scary, the only things we can control are our taxes on the fuel & to some extent the R/$ rate by implementing investor friendly policies, we can't control the price of a barrel of oil & in some cases we can't even control R/$ rate as its affected by outside factor

7849 2018-10-01 08:39:54 Government’s move to cut in borrowing target and steps taken reduce its debt may be a positive sign for the market but it is not enough as the market is seeing its worst sell-off due to weakening currency, rising oil prices and tightening liquidity and others. #GREENPORTFOLIO
7850 2018-10-01 08:39:50 The experts keep blaming the oil price but that is only a contributory factor. If our economy was run decently with a semblance of competence and honesty our currency would be stronger and the high fuel levy unnecessary= (much) lower petrol price and higher growth.

7861 2018-10-01 08:38:15 Oil was not even a fringe-benefit of the US invasion of Iraq. Don't you remember Donald Trump in 2016 complaining that the USA didn't get the Iraqi oil and should just take it?

Oil is always used as a cover-story to hide the influence of the Israel Lobby in causing these wars.

7863 2018-10-01 08:38:02 Fraccing for tight oil or gas causes minimal environmental impact. The regulations in UK are sufficiently strict on all aspects of risk: groundwater harm, chemical pollution, fluid retuns or noise.

Shipping LPG uses unrefined fuel oil which is far more harmful to the planet.

7949 2018-10-01 08:25:06 Cooking gas, CNG become costlier, price of non-subsidised cylinder hiked by Rs 59

The state-run oil marketer Indian Oil Corporation said the hike is due to the change in international price and foreign exchange fluctuations.

7971 2018-10-01 08:21:18 Wait until the oil is hot-ish (stove on medium heat) drop in one or two kernels and wait for those to pop. Then add the rest. Et voila! Take off the heat when the popping slows.

I live on popcorn.

while cutting the carolina reapers, i got some of the oil on my hands, and it burns so fuckin much that i cant sleep
and scrubbing it off requires a heavy-duty sponge and hot water and its easily one of the most painful things ive felt
7977 2018-10-01 08:20:10 Twice this has happened now, what is wrong with @riverisland clothing? Either different sized sleeves on the same shirt or covered in oil or something. I want to order online and trust in a company. #poorquality
7978 2018-10-01 08:20:10 Around two weeks later I got the RoseHip Seed oil, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid. Rosehip didnt do anything wonderful but its nice as a hand moisturizer at night. Alpha Lipoic Acid can only be used twice a week and I don't see much difference. Won't repurchase any of those 3
7979 2018-10-01 08:20:09 Oil is currently high. It has been above 60 for over 2 years now and may peak at $100. What are we doing with the money currently? Where are the infrastructures? Don't lift tweets from that propaganda @FMPWH Handle. I've debunked a lot of their projects already.

7982 2018-10-01 08:19:31 Exactly. Better to distribute it and build many new industries instead of concentrating it all in one spot. It's a massive gamble. It's supposed to be a city of the future, but will be powered by burning even more oil instead of solar power.

8086 2018-10-01 08:02:29 I'm afraid so. The grease is oil based. We've tried everything to get it off before painting it over, but no joy. Going to need several coats of paint, and the place needs a good clean too.

8225 2018-10-01 07:38:11 @narendramodi @arunjaitley @FinMinIndia Exchange rate is less flexible then Price of diesel and petrol. Now its time to bring Both oil under GST regime
8226 2018-10-01 07:37:54 The solution to higher oil prices are more electric cars. But in SA we have the weird policy dichotomy of a carbon tax on cars and a 25% import duty on electric cars.
8227 2018-10-01 07:37:52 Petrol price Monday crossed the Rs 91-mark in Mumbai while domestic cooking gas LPG rates breached the Rs 500-level for the first time ever as oil at four-year high pushed fuel prices to new all-time high across the country.
8228 2018-10-01 07:37:48 D reality has always been. Even though we have oil we have always been a poor when you put our revenues against the population. Qatar is a small country that has oil and is far richer them Nigeria. D false narrative that Nigeria is rich is a big lie which we tell only ourselves

8237 2018-10-01 07:35:21 It’s all TRAIN’s fault. @bamaquino knows it all too well. Oil prices are irrelevant when you can just heap blame on taxes for triggering inflation.

8239 2018-10-01 07:35:13 My life in S E Asia! It really depends whether your hair is fine or thick to begin with and is it naturally straight or curly? If it’s fine you don’t want to weigh it down with serums et al, it’ll just break later. Thick/straight hair? Try Aveda or J Frieda or coconut oil.

8405 2018-10-01 07:04:27 Yeah his response is literally ignorant. CBD oil is great stuff and I'm glad it's available but it definitely isn't the same as the plant.

8725 2018-10-01 06:02:34 What’s not to be taken at face value? Do you not realise that oil prices are based on supply and demand, if there’s not enough oil coming to the market, the price will rise. This is fact not propaganda.
8726 2018-10-01 06:01:47 How true! The whole lot of them are like that. They are a combination of Amway & snake oil salesmen! Arrogant, closed minded, hide bound & largely ignorant of the world outside their cult. We have to get rid of him!

8769 2018-10-01 05:54:22 If oil prices increase, oil producing countries will benefit especially Iran and Venezuela. It will also be a reprieve for the bankrupt US shale gas producers
8770 2018-10-01 05:54:05 If you know the facts, you may not say this .. The excise amount collected in the last 4 years is far more than the amount spent on retiring oil bonds. Nearly 2.5 lakh crores have been collected. It's indeed used for development but not fully justified
@swamy39 is correct in this
8771 2018-10-01 05:54:03 You are wrong! Even oil is a natural resource, so why are the people of Turkana entitled to part of the revenues?
8772 2018-10-01 05:53:49 are YOU eating mineral oil recreationally
8773 2018-10-01 05:53:47 All a game. A clever game. The game is to make money.
8774 2018-10-01 05:53:42 Can you explain why the largest oil and gas producer wants lower prices? Or is the US economy in that much trouble with a record setting bull market and inflation only at 2%?
Or is it all lies?
8775 2018-10-01 05:53:36 Put some peppermint oil on your sinuses it’ll help
8776 2018-10-01 05:53:31 @akaXochi  it’s going to an interesting case. Does the USA have absolute power and authority as to interstate commerce?! What is the state right as to the distribution of information traffic(gas, oil and power is information)

8788 2018-10-01 05:50:56 Additionally there are projects that have economics based on a lower oil price and with   a required time for the returns to be realized. That would be roughly a good estimate of how early we can talk about balanced budget!!

8802 2018-10-01 05:49:33 Nobody told you oil is over 70 a barrel? Because it is. The leftover debt from the last go round is astronomical. Canada has a better system of mining oil. Way cleaner than USA where the DotUrd has scrapped the rules in favour of profits. Plus USA is a net exporter of oil

many hair products contain coconut oil
9037 2018-10-01 05:02:11 Who else put salt and oil in their rice? 
9038 2018-10-01 05:02:03 AB has toned WAY down with the sluggish oil recovery. Not surprising, is it?
9039 2018-10-01 05:01:39 If counties like Turkana are benefiting from oil also Murang’a should benefit from water supplied to other counties. #PayForMurangaWater
9040 2018-10-01 05:01:19 My boyfriend has been away for a week to see family and has come back with rosehip oil, roast duck, and my dream toaster  #TrueLove
9041 2018-10-01 05:01:19 never caught him pumping or spinning and that’s refreshing for someone dangling their referral. He seems genuinely interested in any EV available and prepared to promote the one that he thinks is best without “punishing” non-T brands for entering the ev temple with oil profits.

9060 2018-10-01 04:57:09 Who else is up burning the midnight oil?
9061 2018-10-01 04:56:52 Interests? What a joke. Oil or some rare mineral must have been discovered.
How about defend Britain because it isn't Britain anymore.
9062 2018-10-01 04:56:52 Have you calculated the cost of oil and gas production on the environment, and the emissions your car puts out.  That’s the beauty of this movement, we are starting to head in the right direction.
9063 2018-10-01 04:56:34 Oil = jobs and Economy.

Instead of economic action, they prefer War in Yemen?!
9064 2018-10-01 04:56:19 Inter don't have oil magnate moratti anymore who can blindly pump money into the club.

9070 2018-10-01 04:55:39 You ever just look at something and just try to imagine how you would mix oil paints in order to match its color? God I miss David Hannon
9071 2018-10-01 04:55:18 To be consistent then the percentage of the oil revenue remitted back to the local community in turkana should be scraped and the muranga water distributed to the people in Nairobi supplied for free and not otherwise for monetary gain as currently is.
9072 2018-10-01 04:55:18 next you're going to tell me that shampoo is a magical liquid that just happens to remove oil and unpleasant smells from my hair alongside water? this is REAL LIFE, not some video game xD

9079 2018-10-01 04:53:52 Sometimes, when I can't sleep, I'm just thinking about whether you can manually whip enough water into coconut oil to mimic the water/fat ratio of dairy butter.

9092 2018-10-01 04:50:35 I love that cheap oil from Alberta
9093 2018-10-01 04:50:24 Every night before bed I like to get a little peppermint oil in my eye by accident.
9094 2018-10-01 04:50:22 Abe bevakoof earlier we used to purchase crude oil from Iran too now Iran can't trade moreover the value of dollar went up sharply and crude oil production crisis are there in middle East . Oil is traded in dollars only and value of money isn't good moreover state taxes are high
9095 2018-10-01 04:50:15 It’s kind of a lot lol - but you basically get a spoonful of coconut oil put it in your mouth swish it around for at least 20 mins (that’s where it’s a lot lol) then spit it out. It draws toxins from your body and it’s good for oral health

9105 2018-10-01 04:47:52 The tipping point in electric cars, LEDs and solar came about when the price of oil spiked to bull market highs into 2008, not by government diktat. The price of energy is going to skyrocket in the next few years. That is when we will see the next accelerated move, so be patient.
9106 2018-10-01 04:47:52 I have a speech to give in the morning so obviously I doused my face in oil.
9107 2018-10-01 04:47:51 Im sure the midnight oil is burning in  Washington DC tonight trying to spin this away from democrats.
9108 2018-10-01 04:47:31 i don't get it i'm not even diffusing lavender oil and i'm ready to knock out why am i weak
9109 2018-10-01 04:47:30 Btw. Black seed oil & ACV mixed isn’t that bad
9110 2018-10-01 04:47:21 Asked my trader why crude is up.. he said "Trump wants lower oil prices and is in talks with Saudi". 
9111 2018-10-01 04:46:58 .@TheBigAStabile So true. Charlie was also appears surprisingly clueless! OIL or get out of Eight member Marco Rubio.

9132 2018-10-01 04:43:36 Your hair looks good.  I like the cut!  I can’t use conditioner either and coconut oil causes real issues.  I found apricot oil works.  I put in my hair for 3-5 minutes then wash out.  Can only use twice a week but it’s helping.  #mcas
9133 2018-10-01 04:43:30 also factor in savings from no gas, no oil changes, no air filters, and no expensive engine mechanical problems. Maybe wait until the base model is available, i think that will happen in January.

9138 2018-10-01 04:42:46 This guy is insufferable and a lying snake oil salesman.
9139 2018-10-01 04:42:34 If Govt see short fall in oil tax collection, Govt had will be tied to control price hike. They will increase tax on input items like fertilizer  other farming tools to compensate oil tax loss  . (2/n)
9140 2018-10-01 04:42:33 My point is both are 90% + soybean oil.
9141 2018-10-01 04:42:27 I'd have to agree. But it does depend if you ever want ANY oil on Mother's Day weekend.
9142 2018-10-01 04:42:25 Not quite true. I believe that oil sands extraction and equipment manufacturing for the oil patch qualify as heavy industry. Northern Alberta may be the last industrialized region in Canada in that sense.

9172 2018-10-01 04:38:22 Anecdotal evidence isn't proof of anything

Oil and gas aren't the entire economy, they provide maybe 6% of the country's workforce at best, and find new ways to duck taxes left and right.

9175 2018-10-01 04:37:43 I do okay, but leave-in conditioner & Coconut oil alone is not producing these amazing results I be seeing out here. So what's the tea?
9176 2018-10-01 04:37:38 They possibly will get the same amount, but the excess is to oil the hands that will sanction and release the money from GoI. These are business norms, and in India amounts can be just about anything!!! When daily reports deal with lakhs of thousand crore, merely few lakhs is nix

9180 2018-10-01 04:37:12 Pakistan puts words in Rahul's mouth. Same words are gargled out by Paki at UN. UN as a forum is a place that has no independent ideology. It is under influence of oil power. It will always remain so.

9182 2018-10-01 04:36:39 In an economy focused mainly on oil and outsourced manufacturing, is it any wonder the Canadian economy is so delicate.  This NAFTA mess should be a wake-up call for Canada.  Time to move out of mom's basement and learn to be more independent.  Relying on trade doesn't cut it ...
9183 2018-10-01 04:36:24 We’re going to have to do a lot more work to reduce emissions, but ending oil exploration was a good first step in the right direction. Science clearly shows we can’t afford to burn even known reserves, looking for new ones is dangerous folly. #MakeOilHistory #SeizeTheSun
9184 2018-10-01 04:36:24 Yeah, yeah we know . You were catching some sun when Nancy, Liz, and Kamala dropped by and offered to put some suntan oil on you. Stormy was at the club so you figured what the heck. You told this one before, Mike. 
9185 2018-10-01 04:36:14 The 5 oil sands CEOs put the emissions cap on the table during their negotiations with the 5 ENGOs, plus the province-wide carbon tax, fugitive methane emissions reductions, recycling carbon revenue to support innovation, etc. THE. CEOS.

9190 2018-10-01 04:35:28 They spent $5b on it’s gigafactory 1 alone. And there are several planned. Since battery is pretty much the new oil, I’d say Tesla is far ahead in the game.

9202 2018-10-01 04:33:59 Natural Gas will be fuel of choice for the entire world and will stay that way for foreseeable future.

9204 2018-10-01 04:33:37 I have some bad news. If we have a spill from US Tankers transporting US oil there is NO clean-up response. Call the Beecher Bay First nation and talk to the Chief. He will verify this fact.

9229 2018-10-01 04:28:14 Wages for others have already increased at rates much higher than minimum. Housing and car prices have increased far above inflation, partially due to the over inflated wages in the oil industry. This just starts to level the field for minimum wage earners.
9230 2018-10-01 04:28:12 กลับไปกลับมาฮ่า
9231 2018-10-01 04:28:07 You might not have to wait for the LT if the oil price moves like it did last time it went from $80-$100.  I'd also add $CVN $CVN.ax to the list of players who stand to benefit.

9237 2018-10-01 04:27:06 I've had mixed feelings about shipping oil & LNG from the west coast, but seriously, we need to find a way to build these projects. That's our best prospect for reducing reliance on the US market.

9250 2018-10-01 04:24:44 Yes we do admit what President Trump has done to this country!!!  Stronger, safer borders, booming economy GDP=4.2. Fair trade, companies coming back, coal and oil industry putting people to work, record high stock market,  I could keep going!
9251 2018-10-01 04:24:38 Do you mean the damage more oil would do to the climate and our children’s future?
9252 2018-10-01 04:24:06 EXACTLY. We benefit more than they do.  Canada has 7% farmable land.  The USA has 47% farmable land.  Without the USA, WE ALL STARVE TO DEATH, especially come winter.  Wow, they get cheaper prices on oil... THEY FEED OUR POPULATION.

9254 2018-10-01 04:23:52 Us don't need a physical blockade, they only sanction ship owners if they haul Russian oil. Most will follow orders from us, some not. As with all the other sanctions. Will Russia start war to counter it? No.

9260 2018-10-01 04:23:10 I'm doing another confined space job tonight. This one is a 60' high cylinder with a cone at the bottom. They pipe a mixture of oil, sand, and water into it, and heat it until the oil separates and floats to the top. They then skim off the oil and pump the sand and water out.

9269 2018-10-01 04:20:52 @sto_mkt it’s ok to increase the oil prices with the increase of oil price in the world market. But why there is an increase with immediate effect, meaning ex-stock price too change.. ?

9273 2018-10-01 04:20:37 I’m no expert, but from what I’ve read, Eastern Canadian refineries aren’t equipped to process WCS anyway ... so piping Alberta oil to St John for example would serve no useful purpose. #cdnpoli #ableg

9346 2018-10-01 04:11:23 Let's say Assad won the war in the first 6 months
Then the Iranian gas and oil pipelines would have been built 6 years ago, and 70 Billion dollars would have gone to Iran instead of Russia

Putin wouldn't mind if the war on Syria lasted forever
9347 2018-10-01 04:11:12 Dude. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a legend. I can't come to poker tonight.
9348 2018-10-01 04:11:08 Very intriguing idea for a couple reasons. One, droughts of course, two, farming may have to hydroponic in the new normal of "Rain Bombs" due to changing hydrologic behavior. Plus, when it comes down to it, people need the scarcest resource, water, more than oil.

9360 2018-10-01 04:09:06 Why is it that the weather is always clear until 5 minutes into starting an oil change.

9362 2018-10-01 04:08:23 Oil prices are always expressed based on delivery date, delivery location and delivery time. WTI price is for delivery next month in Cushing, OK. WCS is for delivery next month to Hardisty, AB. When WCS gets to the Gulf, it doesn't trade at the Hardisty price.
9363 2018-10-01 04:08:09 oil paint: probably old clothes u can get dirty/ apron, oil paints, another palette, more brushes (u shouldnt mix w acrylic bc oil Destroys brushes), turpentine, oil medium/ linseed oil, cling wrap to cover ur paints in bc oil paints dont dry that quickly so u can just keep using
9364 2018-10-01 04:07:53 Okay guys, cbd is awesome. I had some last night and I slept soooo good. I had ones that were just candy lemon drops! Very yummy. Gonna look into the oil too.
9365 2018-10-01 04:07:30 With oil staying stubbornly high, these deals are just to keep the lights on. This is yet another failed 'strong season'

Once again a reminder that in 2012, BJP had declared a Bharat Band at ₹78.50 ,Then they came to power in 2014 on the slogan of "#MehngaikiMaar"

And this is still without considering crude oil prices!
9377 2018-10-01 04:05:09 I'm curious how olive oil is a 'Power Food' and bacon drippings are not? They're both largely oleic acid. The saturated fatty acids that the latter contains are not quite the demons they once were. To be chemically consistent, we must categorize the two similarly.
9378 2018-10-01 04:04:56 นี่ใจดีมากแล้วนะครับ

9421 2018-10-01 04:00:02 Being farmers they would rather continue to work n produce milk for a fair price under a efficient supply management model envied around the world.
Maybe the word compensation is more acceptable in the oil and gas industry.

9432 2018-10-01 03:58:45 IMO, it's a walk or talk thing.

My city foodie peers live it, as a word of mouth recommendation & lifestyle choice. Therefore don't question it, to know they are accepting social license not science.

Whereas country is wary eyes open to snake oil vs Ag experience vs Ag science.

9456 2018-10-01 03:56:21 What is the point of the @acccgovau (the government watchdog) telling us we’re paying more for fuel than we should be? Why is it the watchdog sits idle and cannot prosecute oil companies? Any other industry would be in court and facing fines. If it has no power, what’s the point?
9457 2018-10-01 03:56:05 well, i was asking about oils because there's a CBD oil brand called Koi that i've heard really really good things about. Basically you take drops of it under the tongue and stuff like that

9483 2018-10-01 03:52:56 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

9488 2018-10-01 03:52:37 Seriously ? Every time he opens his mouth all I see is an off spring of Alec Jones. When you have real intellect, there is no reason to scream. He tries to hard to talk himself up. Only snake oil salesmen need to talk a product up. His product is him. Holds no value

9492 2018-10-01 03:52:24 coconut oil is a body healer ;  a way of life 
9493 2018-10-01 03:52:11 Kalo masak sendiri pake extra virgin olive oil aja. Lebih bagus dari minyak kelapa.

9496 2018-10-01 03:51:46 I have a can of this 'chicken powder' bc i find that there's a lot of water in the spinach. I start with a hot hot pan and more oil than you think you need.

9499 2018-10-01 03:51:21 Good. You acknowledge one thing Congress inherited Oil bonds worth Rs 1.4 lakh crore without Interest. All knew Dollar to Rupee was increased from Rs 45 appx in 2004 to Rs 65-68 when UPA out of power. 

Messed up Indian economy and blaming NDA now . Superb
9500 2018-10-01 03:51:15 @KenyaPower_Care good morning, Ruringu near oil Libya has not had power since yesterday
9501 2018-10-01 03:51:07 Rising oil prices pose economic risks 
Cut out all the banks and fund houses and the media and you will find that there is really no risk. Not with the abundance of crude oil available. Where is the growth coming from?
9502 2018-10-01 03:50:48 im so excited .... im taking an oil painting class this quarter and starting tuesday i get to start learning oils ... i wanna paint my fursona as a fancy prince . thats all i would like in my life . prince as a fancy ass royal oil painting . im so stoked
9503 2018-10-01 03:50:25 Bombing Dresden wasn't wrong?

There was no torture, only massacre. They were invaders in a sovereign country and paid the price. Rest is British propaganda.

I am a rational human being. Unlike some I don't believe Iraq had WMDs and don't invade other countries for their oil.
9504 2018-10-01 03:50:15 The fear of taking the old oil in is real though.
Like maybe the next homeowner can deal with it.
9505 2018-10-01 03:50:07 Which essential oil was it (sorry I couldn’t find the thread ) thank you!!!!
9506 2018-10-01 03:50:02 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.

9512 2018-10-01 03:49:03 #FakeNewsMedia Farsighted #Modi Government initiated recalibration of meters of petrol pump, so that people will not face any difficulty, when oil will cross Rs. 100.
9513 2018-10-01 03:48:38 I’m about to be upset for the rest of my life bc of how changing my oil went

9515 2018-10-01 03:48:16 Here is the choice - Alaskans who want to protect wild salmon stock and jobs for Alaskans, or multinational corporations who have never had a real Alaska Hire initiative. After all these years, almost 1/2 of the oil jobs go to Outsiders. Vote YES on Prop One!

9518 2018-10-01 03:47:32 For the record, and off the record too, (I am not a seller of hemp oil or cinnamon but it's hard to convince people of that when you're really genuinely honestly authentically patriotically benevolently selflessly desiring to inform others on how to feel and become healthy again)
9519 2018-10-01 03:47:27 I need more wild hair growth oil
9520 2018-10-01 03:47:01 I run out of oil regularly during events.  However, if you're low then lay off the big exp expedition that spends oil for sure
9521 2018-10-01 03:46:52 Although PM's point back in his #UNGA speech quite contradicting with his speech back in Malaysia, 

but gladly his speech spoke about palm oil trade and vetoship in UN. His message is clear.

9527 2018-10-01 03:45:51 As you have obviously followed this issue more than I, what is the commonly held perception of the risks taken by shipment of LNG vs Oil? Is damage to environment as significant and is clean up similar in method and effectiveness?
9528 2018-10-01 03:45:48 one thing that I think Afflicted does do well is highlight the way that the alternative / homeopathic medicine industry has some absolute snake oil monsters who prey upon the desperate. $7 per min phone calls to “treat” a chronic immune disorder by talking to the organs?! Girl.
9529 2018-10-01 03:45:25 Made the my best beard oil so far. Completely happy with it.

9533 2018-10-01 03:45:12 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor.

9540 2018-10-01 03:44:12 .@geography_411 Deepwater BP oil Spill, 2010: caused huge issues to the economic market of the time.

9552 2018-10-01 03:42:58 Why should we cling to dying industries like coal and oil. We need to focus on the industries of the future, especially in technology, to train people in. Instead of making someone work in a mind for 12 hours a day, retrain them as programmers.

9579 2018-10-01 03:40:47 Made possible by fossil fuels, please encourage all your “followers” to turn off the natural gas valve that feeds all their houses. They wouldn’t want to contribute to the dirty oil industry, it would be the most effective way of protesting as well.

9643 2018-10-01 03:31:32 So do NOT expect the US to lift sanctions on Iran ..... Obama is gone! Germany is illegally importing oil from Russia to the detriment of it's allies!

9649 2018-10-01 03:30:52 Very much True.  Please control INR against USD urgently( India must stop seeing/comparing its currency with other countries now) and reduce oil prices.  India must talk to US on oil price and raise concerns.  Oil price will surely going to effect BJP in coming elections also.

9703 2018-10-01 03:22:52 Wrong. very wrong. Then in Africa, we lead in every thing every area of life/study. we had universities (like 5 of them) that were d bests. Then we just stumbled on oil (the black gold). even the white man envied. heard we were giving aid to nations like China & India.

9709 2018-10-01 03:22:09 Canada is not working for Most of Canadians under this Liberal government. 

Why are ships carrying LNG allowed to navigate waters of BC, along with foreign Oil tankers, but no ships allowed to carry Canadian oil.

Gas pipelines are ok, but not oil pipelines.

Give us a break
9710 2018-10-01 03:21:54 Iranian smart ass, what apartheid in Israel? Israel defends itself from being run over by bullies like you, resist to be destroyed, or wiped out, you call apartheid? It should shame you that Israel is a thriving country and you are the dump who survives selling oil.

9724 2018-10-01 03:19:58 The one Ted Cruz ad I've seen on Austin TV is about how he's the undeviatingly loyal defender of the oil and gas industries, while Beto O'Rourke isn't.  It would seem to be more appropriate to Southeast Texas or Louisiana than the Central Texas media market...
9725 2018-10-01 03:19:58 @StephChalm @JoshFrydenberg A credit crunch will come at the latest when there is another oil price shock. It may happen at a lower oil price than in 2008 because the 2nd heart attack will be more difficult to survive. The #BankingRC has NOT analysed this vital issue

9742 2018-10-01 03:17:29 It's a dry powder usually in spray form that you can put on your hair and scalp to soak up excess oil in your hair and extend the amount of time required between water washes, since water makes hair weak and the hair strand is more susceptible to breaking and splitting when wet.

9753 2018-10-01 03:15:21 I haven;t looked into this too much, so it's a tentative idea. Coconut oil does increase LDL in some studies, typically when given in very high doses. But maybe moderate amounts aren't as liable to impact LDL? I don't know.
9754 2018-10-01 03:15:20 witch hazel toner and lavender/rose oil, maybe even vitamin c oil has helped me, at least lightens them A LOT

9758 2018-10-01 03:15:03 At the risk of sounding soft on this - if AZ is anything like TX, the heat and drought causes the roads to get caked with oil. When it rains, any water cause roads to be way more slick than roads where normal rainfall happens. #JustThrowingThatOutThere

9768 2018-10-01 03:13:38 Think of it this way: How many litres of oil are used to produce and deliver a loaf of bread that you buy at Safeway?

Farming, fertilizing, harvesting, processing, transporting, milling, baking, transporting again. Plus moving all the people involved back & forth to work, daily

9803 2018-10-01 03:07:49 Yeah maybe, but the root of the Evil is the so called PetroDollars ie., while the oil prices remain high, the US Dollar remains strong, and that apparently is a MUST, as we know the $US IS, weather you like it or not the Worlds official Reserve Currency
9804 2018-10-01 03:07:47 THO! If you take corn tortillas and fry them in some hot oil for like 10 seconds or so they're AWESOME for tacos
9805 2018-10-01 03:07:42  I put 18,000 miles on my car since February... I don’t think I’m the type that can lease a vehicle. High miles but maintenance is key - oil / brakes / coolants.
9806 2018-10-01 03:07:42 The population will peak at 11B while we use oil. Without it, 10 billion will starve to death.

9813 2018-10-01 03:06:34 Thoughts on #Syria:
1. Trump, #Russia, #Iran, #Israel, & #Turkey all want to get their hands on Syria's oil.
2. The only good actors are the Syrian people, the #Rojava, and the Kurdish people.
3. The US should butt out -- Assad uses the US to keep his people in line.

9911 2018-10-01 02:54:26 @RealMattLucas Just recently finished going through all of Little Britain for the umpteenth time. The world you & Mr Walliams created together is like an oil well of abstract comedic brilliance that never runs dry no matter how many times I revisit it.
9912 2018-10-01 02:54:24 Just put some castor oil in my hair & on my eye brows LOL

9920 2018-10-01 02:53:35 Hi can I introduce you to our lord and savior LightLife meatless ground beef? It browns just like and you just add a little oil and a taco seasoning packet and BAM it’s taco time
9921 2018-10-01 02:53:31 So do I. Everyone does, in fact.
I know you keep telling yourself that you are special and unique in your care for the world, but the realities are:
1) Everyone wants a sustainable future
2) You need to eliminate 90% of the world's population to accomplish it without oil.
9922 2018-10-01 02:53:13 IDK who daughter needs to hear this but... GET AN OIL CHANGE!!!
9923 2018-10-01 02:52:56 Crunchy is bullshit... Like organic with oil sitting on top

9929 2018-10-01 02:51:17 I bought an oil diffuser and it works so well :’ )
9930 2018-10-01 02:51:16 Had the same issues.  Added coconut oil to my bath, started using Oil of Olay bar and that deodorant. No problems since. You're welcome.
9931 2018-10-01 02:51:10 Pake extra virgin olive oil coba biar lembab kulitnya jerawat jg ikut kempes kok
9932 2018-10-01 02:50:49 Raw Shea or cocoa butter. Palmers has an oil specifically for stretch marks that I used when I was pregnant!
9933 2018-10-01 02:50:46 How can I figure out my target market? I'm new to the atrt scene and I'm experimenting with multiple styles and media. If I create an impressionist oil painting one day and an abstract fluid acrylic with calligraphy the next day, will this affect buyer interest? #artnetAMA
9934 2018-10-01 02:50:35 Now how you recycle oil ? My momma said i should throw it in the grass, so ima throw it in the grass
9935 2018-10-01 02:50:30 It's bad where I live. Oil boom country.
9936 2018-10-01 02:50:28 I really wish the O&G commercial with Tracee Bentley could have included her stating that they can’t afford to elevate our health & safety above oil and gas operations. Keep riding that horse, and we will continue to share the actual truth. @ColoradoRising
9937 2018-10-01 02:50:26 Gusto ata ng thesis adviser namin mamatay. Pinaulit yun oil extraction namin, ang pinakahate konsa buong process. 
9938 2018-10-01 02:50:25 Don't forget the Thieves Oil. 
9939 2018-10-01 02:50:19 I was never allowed to utilise oil bombs and sharp objects in the manner of Kit.  Perhaps that's the future of education ;p  Or at least a route to faster shorthand success
9940 2018-10-01 02:50:19 ありがとうございます！

9944 2018-10-01 02:50:00 My car has been having oil circulation issues. 
If I drive it on the freeway and go to idle the oil light comes on and there is no oil in the pan. If I drive on back roads I can go double the distance before it does it...

Oil pump is new cleaned pick up, what gives??? I'm lost.

9946 2018-10-01 02:49:52 Well hidden is not the right word...there is NO NEWS on 
how big-Pharma is really just a legal cartel
& big oil has not only held back info on Global Warming they studied decades ago...but they crushed electric cars years ago & god knows how many other new forms of energy

9948 2018-10-01 02:49:37 What’s a good oil/cream for stretch marks??
9949 2018-10-01 02:49:36 お誕生日おめでとうございます！
9950 2018-10-01 02:49:35 woke up to 2 really sad news
1. hike in Oil and LPG prices again 
2. Varun Dhawan won a best actor trophy  
the 2nd one broke my heart
9951 2018-10-01 02:49:34 The world has greatly increased renewable energy but still oil use is growing....probably because it’s relatively cheap.
9952 2018-10-01 02:49:33 My mom once told me is the oil that is added.... Red oil must be prepared as stew before eating 
9953 2018-10-01 02:49:30 No oil, bacon and timbits.
9954 2018-10-01 02:49:19 I just saw your ad. What a joke. Voting YES on 112. Keep oil and gas out of Colorado.
9955 2018-10-01 02:49:12 This is bullying and harassment of a child!  Absolutely.
9956 2018-10-01 02:49:12 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
9957 2018-10-01 02:48:43 i thought i got to sleep in tomorrow because i didn’t work until 2, but i forgot i had an appointment to get my oil chainged at 10am 
9958 2018-10-01 02:48:29 にじゅうきゅうさい。
9959 2018-10-01 02:48:27 Put a little baby oil on 2 minutes before getting out of the shower. The smell will rinse away, but your skin will be extremely soft all day
9960 2018-10-01 02:48:22 I read where US allegedly placed sanctions on Venezuelan Oil. I can understand the US not buying it (besides fracking and cheap oil from Canada makes them self sufficient) but I don’t see how the US can stop others ( China) buying Venezuelan or Russian.

9966 2018-10-01 02:47:31 Who knows, but the media will spin it as a loss for Trump no matter what. 

I hope we got oil out of it. That'll make the leftists heads explode. 

Can't wait for the substitute drama teacher to tell everyone how he stood up to Trump. Lmao.
9967 2018-10-01 02:47:31 おっはこんにちはー
きょうから１０月昨日の台風の雨風すごかったですね…まさに台風一過。雲ひとつ無い青空が暑いし今年のお天気の乱高下は予想以上ですね。
皆さんまずは安全と体調に注意して、ゆっくりスタートしましょ( ☼皿☼)
9968 2018-10-01 02:47:30 LMAO
9969 2018-10-01 02:47:24 Vegetable oil or soap or alcohol will smother them and make them release, but you run the risk of them releasing yuck into her skin. If you’re just concerned about hurting her you could use orajel or something to numb it
9970 2018-10-01 02:47:10 いらんぞ。
ついにカウントダウンが始まってしまった…。一足お先です…
9971 2018-10-01 02:47:03 Hace un tiempo átras presente mi cv en Oil (ya que tengo experiencia en el tema de ventas), mucha gente me dijo que el nuevo dueño buscaba chicas "lindas" sin importar la experiencia y termino siendo así.
9972 2018-10-01 02:46:59 My little oil diffuser brings me so much happiness
9973 2018-10-01 02:46:48 The issue is habitat protection that prevents indiscriminate logging, mining, and seismic oil exploration.
9974 2018-10-01 02:46:47 Sir this is normal... OgRA recommended oil price increase thats y they played this ticker... However govt did not approved... Happens in every govt
9975 2018-10-01 02:46:46 @narendramodi @dpradhanbjp How the Prices of Petrol and Diesel increase.Why Ethanol prices hv been increased? 52Rs/litr. What sense it makes.Oil companies sell Greases,Coolants,Engine Oils at 3times its actual price.This is a public loot.
9976 2018-10-01 02:46:43 What if they find him innocent? Do we just say “SORRY”????  Does it just go away, and EVERYONE all of a sudden believes him? And Diane just goes back to drinking prunes and olive oil? If I were him, I would want intense PAY BACK!

9985 2018-10-01 02:45:42 What oil & leave in conditioner do you use? #BlackTwitter I need more options
9986 2018-10-01 02:45:38 Seriously, the current administration wants this so the Parks lose money & they have an excuse to drill & mine. When Zinke visited the Carr fire, slammed environmentalists, they basically want to clear cut everything. Logging, coal, oil, mining for elements 
9987 2018-10-01 02:45:37 Coconut oil makes everything so much better

9993 2018-10-01 02:44:50 Ok my diffuser says to add 4-5 drops of an essential oil but i put like half the bottle in there uh
9994 2018-10-01 02:44:49 Actually nail polish smell is my least favorite smell ever! My daughter uses hers outside.
I'm sure some gloss oil based paint would work similar
9995 2018-10-01 02:44:38 THIS. I’ve destroyed 2 oil pans on my car on that road.

Right: term limits. I still don’t understand the liberal argument against them tbh
