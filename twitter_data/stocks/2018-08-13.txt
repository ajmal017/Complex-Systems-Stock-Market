Shame to see Locatelli go, never truly lived up to expectations but I do believe they do need to bring in another ball playing midfielder before  deadline
60 2018-08-13 23:20:41 Because Azelia is messy. Because Azelia shouldn’t be telling  people’s business. Because Azelia was lucky to be in Elson’s house as a guest. Because no one else would be dealing with Azeila’s crazy ass. Because Tesla stocks, funding, revenues is none of Azelia’s business.
61 2018-08-13 23:18:18 Normal people: Buy cookies and cakes for snacks

I also used to snack on canned potatoes...actually why did I stop?? I need to buy some canned potatoes!
62 2018-08-13 23:16:04 A good reason not to invest in individual stocks but ETFs following broad indices like SPY, ACWI so on! Many fat cat billionaire speculators also manipulate stock prices with business media colluding with them. I invest only in ETFs. No individual stocks.

71 2018-08-13 23:05:00 I totally agree. Canada is leading in the industry right now... Look into penny stocks tied with the cannabis industry. Basically all these companies are startups due to the industry being so new. So we'll need to do heavy research on some of these guys.
72 2018-08-13 23:03:08 Trading stocks is a high stress jobs. The last I checked men still constituted 94% of the non-military deaths on the job. The employers need more balance in recruiting women for those jobs because some form of discrimination might have been at work.

77 2018-08-13 22:59:25 I own all stocks (a few MLPs and 5 REITs), in addition to the companies with a typical corporate structure in my taxable account through Robinhood. I also own a mutual fund in my retirement account called Capital Income Builder (CAIBX).

79 2018-08-13 22:58:20 Who benefited the most when Obama threw trillions of taxpayer dollars at the economy, when the Fed was using quantitative easing 1, 2, and then Infinity to inflate stocks, when green industries were propped up only to bust, and when banks were bailed out without any prosecutions?
80 2018-08-13 22:56:50 Wow! Are you delusional or what? Trickle down economics never worked, not for Reagan, not for Trump. The 1% do not give out jobs. With all their tax breaks they just purchase their own stocks & lay off employees. They Outsource jobs 4  cheapest price, their greed knows no bounds.
81 2018-08-13 22:56:30 No, stay away.. If you want cannabis stocks' look at some penny stocks. Many, very cheap cannabis startups listed. You could make some really good money.

83 2018-08-13 22:51:18 Your analysis is so shallow, it’s hard to know where to start. l’ll pick the stock market: tax cuts used by big corporations for buy backs are inflating the market. The market, however, is not the economy. Bottom 60% own 1.8% of stocks. Top 1% own 40%. Which group benefits most?

92 2018-08-13 22:39:43 The tax cuts are working by causing the stock market to boom and as such help out everyones pensions as they are based off the stocks. Just more reason we need @PearlKimPA in order to keep our taxes low and grow our businesses #KeepAmericaGreat
93 2018-08-13 22:39:27 Yea. Timing is everything. I’m watching oil closely here. If it continues to slip that should weigh heavily on US GDP going forward. Thinking trade deficit will suffer as well considering China tariffs on US LNG & oil. Notice today that USD flat, long bond ylds up stocks down?
94 2018-08-13 22:39:00 Frankly the most idiotic debate I keep hearing now is "Growth vs Value". 

They are both going down. 

They are both overpriced. Buying "Value" is like buying GE 2 years ago at 35. Pepsi, Coke, you name it. All these "value" stocks are trading at 3x to 4x where they should be.

99 2018-08-13 22:33:52 She shrugs a little bit. “A lot of my money comes from stocks and investments, I own property and things like that. A lot of it was handed down to me from my parents, you know?”

103 2018-08-13 22:30:00 Thinks I focus on before buying a stock: what do the standard numbers say, how does the chart look, how do competitors perform, recent news of the company, industry related news, forums, overall sentiment, dividend y/n, the agenda, and more. #stocks

106 2018-08-13 22:28:40 Markets, and specifically individual stocks, manifest themselves in trends. While trends do not exist in all stocks all the time, they do exist in most stocks some of the time. And that directional price momentum tends to persist long enough to exploit and profit from.

131 2018-08-13 22:09:24 Agreed. Everything is getting deeply oversold at once. Venture, gold (+ most commodities), pot stocks, crypto, junior miners etc etc. Charts falling off a cliff. This is capitulation
132 2018-08-13 22:09:04 Anything can be a store of value if it is useful and in demand but many economists agree highly volatile things like stocks and crypto are not very good as a SOV.

142 2018-08-13 21:59:51 You wouldn't want to barter with it as face value is less than the value of the metal weight, but if that situation does happen, American Eagles are still legal tender as they have face value.

147 2018-08-13 21:56:58 Huge boom in stock buy backs in 2008-2010 at least made some economic sense. Stocks were significantly undervalued at that time due to the recession.....today the exact opposite is true, stock are historically overpriced.  Just seems like a plan to make CEOs richer.

Their growth & profit only will benefit the average Joe & offset the failures of govt pensions globally. Im not sure the point you're trying to make here.

197 2018-08-13 21:19:47 This is a tough one to answer without more information as there are a lot of variables (the goal for this money; how long you intend to keep it invested; whether you invest in individual company stocks/mutual funds/ETFs/etc.).
198 2018-08-13 21:19:33 Mine just thinks all stocks are "gambling" and equally whenever I say it's been a good 6 / 12 months she says "so have you actually sold any" which she knows without me answering is typically NO!  She tolerates me - who said romance is dead 
199 2018-08-13 21:18:44 This kind of stupidly should bring back the stocks and throwing rotten fruit at idiots like this.

202 2018-08-13 21:17:54 I think you raise a valid point. But I think it's equally valid to say new investors should try & understand how market cycles work and how they impact their stocks before they start investing. All too many folks ignore mkt conditions & sell rules when starting out.
203 2018-08-13 21:17:25 I’ve never bought:

204 2018-08-13 21:15:19 Would you invest in real estate if it were like stocks?

(Pls vote seriously)
205 2018-08-13 21:15:04 I wish I could do the same.
If it was like normal stocks then maybe. 
In hindsight maybe invested way too much.
However, if for some miraculous reason the hype somehow returns. I guess I will be thanking myself.
Oh well....still got food in the cupboards

215 2018-08-13 21:09:52 I do think banning bump stocks was dumb, but doesn't violate the 2nd amendment. 

My point was there's a lot of bad terms thrown around by the left.
And not you specifically, but I've seen a lot of leftists just go "yes I want to take your guns". This doesn't help anything.
216 2018-08-13 21:09:18 I've walked out a few times recently, today I only did half a shop, there are always empty shelves with tags on, butcher can't offer product that you want, they have high stocks of product nobody buys. My thoughts are the same, that there is some major problem at Morrison's
217 2018-08-13 21:07:26 Well the responsible gun owners know all the terms and will call out bad laws and such as they see them.

like for instance.. Trump banning Bump Stocks.
Do you know what those are? And if so, did you know you can get the same effect by using a stick?

263 2018-08-13 20:44:50 The Fed has eliminated the boom bust cycle. Stocks have reached a permanently high plateau.

270 2018-08-13 20:40:06 Real estates & stocks investments  will be the wises decision I make! 
271 2018-08-13 20:39:24 Not yet. Stocks may sell after mid September. USD is strong and US bonds are still trying to rally while EMs are weak. Fed can easily keep US markets buoyant at least until the next FOMC meeting with a few bigger securities lending ops and reduced reverse repos. $SPX $DJX

277 2018-08-13 20:34:19 calling people who panic sell their Alts for BTC bitcoin maximalists makes as much sense as calling people who sold their stocks off in 2009 cash maximalists.
278 2018-08-13 20:33:27 Our debt has increased beyond belief, revenue stream not as good as expected, cos buying their stocks back doesn't help middle class - chickens will come home to roost.
279 2018-08-13 20:33:26 World stocks fall: US -.4%; Europe -.3%. General trade tensions + Turkey specific issues including its sharp currency decline lead world markets to consolidate. US market a hair expensive even with solid earning's growth so some caution is prudent in the short-term.

311 2018-08-13 20:11:53 Lesson ZERO (Starting out):
You can’t trade stocks or options without a brokerage account. Popular options include ETrade, Ameritrade, Schwab & Robinhood.
Choose a brokerage, open an account and make a deposit. Whoever you choose, download their app and get very familiar with it!

323 2018-08-13 20:03:21 External negative demand shocks like Turkey (and Brazil, Russia and the EZ periphery beforehand) are bullish for US stocks because they keep globally-traded goods producers from getting pricing power. This is the Goldilocks scenario where US monopolies dominate.

You do know that you die way faster in Ultimate than 4, hence why people are ACTUALLY thinking about raising stocks from 2 to 3-5

402 2018-08-13 19:26:39 To elaborate further, dividends reduce firm net worth in national accounts. Buybacks do not affect SNA net worth. Stocks are exchanged for money.

416 2018-08-13 19:19:44 If you buy stocks hoping they go higher then risk reward might be 50/50 and over time you spin your wheels on wins and losses, If you chase with that FOMO feeling risk reward is probably against you and you lose over time. Risk reward must be in your favor to win long term

Perhaps not 90/10 in favor of Onpattro but maybe around 80/20. If approaches 50/50,MC should be reversed! $ions

519 2018-08-13 18:12:15 It is almost insane how cheap some of these stocks are. A couple names would get re-rated quickly if they moved to a bigger exchange. Exchange change or not, I feel re-rating is inevitable.
520 2018-08-13 18:10:52 My blue run is over . Down 0.19% today, CTG MCL and XPD the main .   Nothing that stands out on the  side.  A lacklustre start to the week.

The answer is no.

That’s because there was nothing to recover from. Jobs, stocks and GDP-every measure of performance of economy under Trump is indistinguishable from Obama’s. Thank you Obama
548 2018-08-13 17:49:39 I need to adapt your strategy on these kind of stocks. Lots of broken charts that have no velocity on the down side. Many stocks making accelerating sales and profits yet hard to make any forward progress without spinning the roulette wheel.

678 2018-08-13 16:38:36 Whenever there is a market wide correction, some stocks will have a loss of capital while others will have a permanent loss of capital.

699 2018-08-13 16:26:07 Here is a quick #overview about my #screening process:
 Run large scans on the weekend.
 Look for unusual volume every day.
 Create a small focus #watchlist.
 Set alarms for potential #stocks and calculate entries before.
700 2018-08-13 16:25:40 On Ford, a lot of their debt is from Ford Credit, not automotive debt. This is a good example of how screening for stocks can be misleading.

705 2018-08-13 16:24:38 @BNNBloomberg One notices how infrequently the stock prices of Colt, Winchester, Smith and Wessen, etc. are mentioned by the financial media. Their stocks are through the roof. Gun sales go up the more shootings there are. Gun Registries obstruct sales.

711 2018-08-13 16:22:16 Yes, calling it digital money undermine how big a breakthrough it is in computer science. Ask the nerds! 

I know Pomp is well aware. But, framing matters since this isn't money equivalent of using Robinhood to buy stocks or having electronic copies of share certificates.

714 2018-08-13 16:20:16 .I've heard that, too. But think: which stocks are short-sellers most likely to want to borrow from zero-fee funds? Are those the same stocks funds investors should own? As for 0-fee index funds, derivatives offer easier ways to short an index.)

717 2018-08-13 16:17:07 Mogg is very into stocks and equities from an early age. He has his own investment company. It may not be his only reason for supporting Brexit, but he will likely stand to make money out of it. Reducing environmental standards is another of his motivations.

721 2018-08-13 16:15:39 @AskRobinhood if someone’s in a position on a stock you offer and that stock gets delisted, how would they exit their position via Robinhood? You don’t currently offer OTC stocks, so... 
722 2018-08-13 16:15:37 If they think they're right though, they hold on for the ride. I've never actually purchased a short, so I'm not certain the exact mechanism for a cover at the end of the transaction. A buddy of mine sells to shorts, and its interesting to listen to the costs different stocks get

724 2018-08-13 16:13:39 I don't know, if working with liquid stocks/fx I can't imagine there being too much of a difference in terms of supply/demand between returning 10% on a 10k account vs a 1m account. Especially with a small bit of leverage.

726 2018-08-13 16:12:50 Harpoon B2 is the likely choice if they decide on an interim missile. Can upgrade our current stocks for a fraction of the price. May, or may not include some air-launched variants, might need fresh purchases. However, no budget, so would come out of contingency funding.

756 2018-08-13 15:57:30 Many right wingers rubbish opinion polls which don't come in our favour because they don't want to beleive we are losing.  Similarly lot of ppl who own stocks don't want to beleive any bad news about the stock they own.  (1/2)
757 2018-08-13 15:57:22 what CDN stocks do you cover?

759 2018-08-13 15:56:40 Yes, but financially not possible at the moment. In an emergency, we would likely have access to US and Norwegian stocks. Especially since the US operates P8s out of Lossi and Iceland.

783 2018-08-13 15:43:37 To be fair, they are not banning short-selling. They are extending uptick rule to BIST 100 stocks, which were not subject to it before.
784 2018-08-13 15:43:35 You can’t sustain income on selling off your capital stake. Stocks can go back down. Cash flow comes from actual economic activity and generates actual cash money. The rich use their assets to extract real income, not just more assets.

949 2018-08-13 14:24:49 Hey. Thanks for replying. Yes morning star shows based on MF. I was more keen to see consolidated buy and sold on basis of stocks with effect on price clearly visible like you shown in some excel i think :)
950 2018-08-13 14:23:39 Some would call that a long term investment.  Your argument (or Samson's as it were) could equally be applied to companies with US Treasuries on their balance sheet, or stocks in other companies.

Groceries. Paying more?

If you have negative answers, Trump's economy is good for him, but not for you.

1065 2018-08-13 13:38:19 I stopped following at realdonaldtrump. Tired of bs. He's killing the economy, I don't see the economic turn around Washington is implying. Stocks continue to take a beating because of his amateur policies. While the GOP and Democrats do nothing to stop him.

1071 2018-08-13 13:36:13 oh, no that wasn't the goal. They literally just said that the phrase 'working class' meant all and every one who works out of necessity. Middle class people had private incomes from stocks/property, upper class people had titles. I've come across this set of defs. a LOT.

1087 2018-08-13 13:28:40 Will let Tom answer for himself, but for me Gold is just another market. Same as stocks, bonds, and even crypto. Nothing magical about it. Purely a vehicle for speculation.
1088 2018-08-13 13:28:16 Trump is ruining our economy on purpose, people. Putin has told him to. That way Putin, Trump, and oligarchs can buy up undervalued US stocks and real estate.

1100 2018-08-13 13:18:58 The Yen will be first to fall since Japan's budget deficits are running at 2x GDP.  The Central Bank there is printing money that is being used to buy stocks.

1105 2018-08-13 13:17:05 I agree that grassroots efforts are needed to ensure greater accountability for members of Congress.  Most members of Congress end up holding stocks or having a financial interest in companies that then are impacted by their legislation.
1106 2018-08-13 13:16:36 With the stock market turning highly volatile this year, many stocks have formed base-on-base patterns. Keep an eye out for those, because they tend to be strong chart formations.

1142 2018-08-13 12:58:37 There is no conceivable reason to have bump stocks or  military style guns with the ability to kill many people in a matter of seconds on the market. Just being able  to change this would be a big step. I read NRA is going  bankrupt. What does that mean?

通貨安って、やっぱそうなるよなぁ。

AUDは、リスク通貨というのはトルコと同じだけど、資源通貨であって安定成長国の通貨だから本来連れ安はおかしい気がするが、どーなんでしょ？

ま、安さを利用するだけなので何が正しいかはどっちでもいーんですがwww
1178 2018-08-13 12:36:04 I'm with you on the building of more social housing but surely right to buy must stay,  maybe suspended until stocks are repleni, but the Right to buy gives people an achieveable target of one day owning their own home and the security that brings.
1179 2018-08-13 12:35:36 45 says "as President I can't have a conflict of interest" because the criminal conflict of interest statute 18 USC 208 doesn't apply to him. @TinaSmithMN and other Congressional Investment Club members say the same about their pharma and medical device stocks. Voters call BS!
1180 2018-08-13 12:35:19 Critics of stock buybacks (New York Times)are missing the point: stocks are so cheap at 17 p/e that it makes sense to keep capitalizing on bargain prices. Corporate profits are growing and at record highs. Stock shortage also keeps growing as M&A competes with buybacks..
1181 2018-08-13 12:35:11 Every one has a niche that makes them feel comfortable. Mine as I said is small cap stocks. Try to trade a few different instruments with money you can lose and try to understand what fits best your personality
1182 2018-08-13 12:34:10 It depends what you want to trade. I trade small cap stocks. IqOption allows you to trade every kind of instruments with big leverage but it is really risky.
1183 2018-08-13 12:33:57 @AskRobinhood please tell me you’re aware of an issue where I cannot search for stocks to either buy or sell..
1184 2018-08-13 12:33:52 This isn't a get rich quick scheme this is a 3-5 year investment. Look at Apple stocks in the 90's until now you would have been a smart cookie to hold since then. Imagine when tron achieves the same in half that time. You can retire early in a few years

1199 2018-08-13 12:24:20 Why send him to prison? Waste of time and money, costs $50,000 a year to house prisoners and it uses years of their time. Sentence him to a week in the stocks AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME, then give him 20 lashes in a public flogging. Cheap, fast, gives time to do better, effective.
1200 2018-08-13 12:23:57 That’s extremely strange how the same $HMNY bears (BobDoleYahoo & Buddies) that are trying to convince everyone they are right about the status of #MoviePass are the same bears that are creating fake accounts at Yahoo to mimic, scare people, and trick #investors.
1201 2018-08-13 12:23:39 Few stocks valuation look attractive on EV/EBITDA but expansive on P/E. Two possible reason - lot of finance costs (other than interest) loaded in interest costs or plant life is lower & hence higher depreciation. These names generally end up as value trap.

1311 2018-08-13 10:58:10 @dennisfprescott Hey Legend, I'm taking the inspiration I got from you to the next level. I want to start making my own stocks cause I remember reading Bourdain's book & he sung the praises of it

Could you point me in the direction of some good recipes to make an awesome stock?
1312 2018-08-13 10:58:07 Flight BE831 final call! Please proceed to gate 10 immediately.
1313 2018-08-13 10:56:32 Well given the options....I fear if soft power were to end we’d all be marched back into fudal serfdom, public executions and the stocks, I thought propaganda was there to create an air of civility at home (obvs not in the colonies)
1314 2018-08-13 10:54:36 Make America poor again.  Food stocks soar.
1315 2018-08-13 10:54:05 Flight BE831 is now boarding. Please proceed to gate 10
1316 2018-08-13 10:53:57 They could. No guarantees we will get a #crash in Oct, but my expectation is that we will, pre #Midterms. Perfect storm of issues hitting US stocks in Sept/Oct. But I could be wrong and it slips into early 2019.
1317 2018-08-13 10:53:12 The rest are leaving because of no work .The cod fishery is gone yet there are good stocks seal hunt is gone because of these silly people protesting .Money is wasted and this equality shit and climate crap .That should be last on the list for now.Fix the important issues first!

1327 2018-08-13 10:47:53 Few days ago u had a crack at me for not agreeing AKM was a great buy @2.8c

I said I don’t think that stocks that have run up hard off their lows represent great risk reward punts

Looks like I was right

But PCL@0.6c was good entry for BESBS we are seeing

I provide evidence that the £ has plummeted to 2008 crash levels.

That’s why import costs have risen and inflation.

1548 2018-08-13 06:36:19 the idea that "buy your house to stay in because it's the best asset" is illogical to me because I can also buy stocks and gold or FD. But the idea that "buy your house because you want to own the place where you stay" - makes more sense. Just my personal view. Thanks.
1549 2018-08-13 06:35:40 That valuation only matter when you sell the team???  That’s like saying you shouldn’t care that you home is worth $1 million versus $2 million because you won’t sell it for 10 years. Or having $2 million in stocks doesn’t matter because you are not selling it right then.

1555 2018-08-13 06:32:11 There is a need for some inter-generational solidarity here! The far right has long called for personal accounts and a reduction in social insurance. I don't think it's the answer - and I don't think you do either!

1667 2018-08-13 04:08:10 SME stocks are traded with minimum lot size worth INR 1 lac & in multiples thereof. This is with a view to protect small investors having low risk tolerance. Other view is trading with minimum lot size hampers liquidity and thus lot trading should be dispensed with. Your view?

1730 2018-08-13 03:17:11 It would not surprise me at all if 45  & Russia sent$$. This would be a great incentive for Manafort not to flip. Because based on what I’ve read Manafort is broke, no stocks, bonds or offshore accounts. He was barely getting by in 2016 during the campaign.
1731 2018-08-13 03:16:36 You know that those numbers were inflated at the beginning of the year when Trump was playing with Kim Jong in N Korea and boosted the military stocks while everything else was falling!

1792 2018-08-13 02:27:52 U.S. Market Check

    Stocks sold off around the world, with U.S. equities erasing what would’ve been a sixth weekly gain as Turkey’s economic crisis deepened.

    The dollar capped its best week since June as the lira sank to a record.

1795 2018-08-13 02:23:13 My position cost me 75.20 C$. I sold half last year because it seemed like I owned too much of one thing. My position in MSFT IS 52% of the tech stocks that I own. The balance is HPQ and ORCL. I like the MSFT dividend.

1802 2018-08-13 02:04:30 I think he underestimates you, he does not consider the time you spent screening stocks and factors. One of the reason his hedge fund had problems is that he did not consider the momentum in a good short. Something you talked about in a podcast.

1810 2018-08-13 01:52:57 True that. Would much rather have the companies plow that money into r&d or employees than just into buybacks. Heck, I'd half settle for a special dividend...

1815 2018-08-13 01:49:59 4/ I agree with you that the dollar is THE big driver from a global asset allocation stand point. If you are bullish in the dollar over next 3-4 years then you don't want to overweight EM equities. (No matter how cheap EM stocks look.)

1819 2018-08-13 01:45:56 I own a reasonably big medical wholesaler and this is not scare mongering. We are already seeing quite a few out of stocks. Critical lines like iv catheters. We have real problems coming. Major customers of mine (everyday names) are getting very worried.
1820 2018-08-13 01:45:47 At it’s heart, I think “value” investing is less about the particular metrics of a screen but rather the fact that the investor ignores the current market narrative about companies whose stocks are not keeping up with the momentum darlings of the moment.

1855 2018-08-13 01:09:52 There would be nothing wrong with a portfolio of 50% stocks, 45% bonds and 5% crypto. Cash doesn’t necessarily belong in any portfolio. (Although, in my personal portfolio, I agree with your view that’s it’s a good thing to have.)

1887 2018-08-13 00:25:06 you are correct of course.  Many of us were/are too greedy and not savvy enough to prepare in that manner.   It's hard to invest in bonds when you believe in stocks, and then it's too late.
1888 2018-08-13 00:20:50 2 stocks no matter what was a bad idea. one rage death or 1 mistake and the game is pretty much over.  Nothings more exciting then starting a game with 3 stocks atleast in the game.

1900 2018-08-13 00:13:12 I agree with your and Luke’s thinking except at the last step. I think the refuge will be USTs, not SPX. CBs will bury stocks to save sovereign debt if they are forced to pick.
