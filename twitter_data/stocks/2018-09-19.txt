I don't gamble so I don't do stocks and it seems to bug you more than anything that Trump is an animal. Personally I suffer from emotional constipation.

8 2018-09-19 23:56:57 Right. But, this is still OTC, so expect selling for sure as people who trade OTC stocks can't imagine holding and waiting very long. They'll lose out.

40 2018-09-19 23:47:32 Another conpany provided 20 minute delayed stock prices and a pic of a naked girl. At the time porn and stocks were about 60% of the internet. Almost made sense. But 20 minute delayed when all the brokerages were rolling out free real time level 2 quotes. Had to fail.
41 2018-09-19 23:46:59 Lol jk it’s stocks 
42 2018-09-19 23:45:23 So, here’s my thought . I read about a young fellow  who’s a Presidential candidate for 2020 who is almost totally unknown.  I like his solution to the intersection of two big problems for the USA: Automation and AI. These are problems for people  not for Corp. profits&amp;stocks.
43 2018-09-19 23:45:19 I am sure you will stay as focused on this tragedy as you did on banning bump stocks.
44 2018-09-19 23:45:02 I believe those without a home would kill for the opportunity of having a house especially one owned by the council as they have a trustworthy landlord who abides by the law and on the whole look after their housing stocks. It’s such a shame when some people abuse that privilege
45 2018-09-19 23:44:56 Most of mine is diversified thought stocks. I’ve seen tremendous growth. Again you need to fire yourself and hire someone who knows what their doing. Most of those I know are as well. I’m glad you’re not my accountant
46 2018-09-19 23:44:33 Has anyone noticed that since rappers have stopped wearing Polo, they stocks have gon down the drain 
47 2018-09-19 23:42:57 Also the absurdity of what the internet stocks were doing. Covad was leasing DSL lines from the Baby Bells then trying to compete against the Baby Bells on DSL service. Was never going to work. But the stock for a while holy cow.
48 2018-09-19 23:40:50 I’m in commodities but for stocks I always say buy in what you either use or like, but I do like GLD for some gold exposure
49 2018-09-19 23:40:33 My list: commercial real estate, biotech, private equity & venture capital, auto loans, student debt, European high yield bonds, Bitcoin, cannabis stocks, most sovereign bonds, FANG/tech stocks (“new Nifty Fifty”), private lending, central bank balance sheets (the primary cause!)
50 2018-09-19 23:39:23 Changing a life is not a small thing.  Some discomfort is required to make it happen.
51 2018-09-19 23:39:08 Those 20 stocks up 900% or more all started the year above $5 a share. It really was incredible and I have never seen a market even close to 1999 since. The breadth of the advance was the kicker. It wasn't one or two internet names it was hundreds.
52 2018-09-19 23:38:12 Yup, the alt coin of MJ stocks!
53 2018-09-19 23:37:46 If crypto took on pot stocks stoners would be like, "wait woah! Where did our money just go bro? It was right here like a minute ago!" -It'd be brutal
54 2018-09-19 23:37:22 I know options are available but do u plan on adding shorting stocks? Cmon fam, hook it up, we bout that side $$!
55 2018-09-19 23:37:00 I don't think the money will come out of stocks, but I believe crypto can ride the "mania" phase of the bull market upward, maybe a lot. Soon. If I see crypto going up, I'll take that as a sign that the bear market is coming. That's pullback. Before was a crash.
56 2018-09-19 23:36:37 #THC Hempcoin. Moving up with ganja stocks. Strong coin n quite resilient to btc moves.
57 2018-09-19 23:35:17 $ALT $NBEV $IGC $CRON $MTEM $SEAC $JONE $ADVM $PTIE $CNAT $AWSM $CSBR $ZYNE $TLRY stocks to keep on watch 20-09
58 2018-09-19 23:34:25 crypto already had a massive pullback. 80-97% across the board from jan-now. if anything money will flow from the stocks to the coins. let's see.
59 2018-09-19 23:32:19 Oh, and be careful of Cannabis stocks... If $TLRY falls, they all fall
60 2018-09-19 23:31:12 so many hot soulless finance guys checking the stocks at the Yankees / Red sox game!!!
61 2018-09-19 23:31:08 So let me get this straight: because of his policies the US economy has been growing faster in comparison to the rest of the world, the dollar has been strengthening, US stocks have outperformed internationals, and he might catalyze peace with North Korea. Yet yes a disgrace?
62 2018-09-19 23:30:40 iOS 12 is literally sad... #iOS12 everything is the same except my stocks... Anticlimactic
63 2018-09-19 23:30:21 I spend my day building a daily watch list of stocks under $10, then trading it while streaming my E*TRADE account live to my clients who pay a fee to learn how I've been trading for 7-years and apply it themselves. So basically I teach real money trading for a fee.
64 2018-09-19 23:30:20 I really wanna start investing big $ into stocks but don’t know where to start..
65 2018-09-19 23:30:05 Financial  stocks rally as 10-year treasury yield rises to highest since May around 3.08%, helped to lift shares of financial companies, which enjoyed the best performance on the day among the 11 sectors of the S&P 500.
66 2018-09-19 23:29:47 My portfolio Now ; let’s see how the pot stocks react tomorrow : $CRON $MEDP $FNKO $NBEV $YEXT $SENS $BEAT $STAA $PSTG. Also bad movement from $MEDP instead of going to ATH it made a shakeout , creating a darvas  .
67 2018-09-19 23:29:24 Hi, @SenRonJohnson, I'm affected. I don't want your prayers, I want
1. Universal background checks
2. A red flag law
3. Ban assault weapons and bump stocks
68 2018-09-19 23:28:27 this is a historic bull run in stocks. what goes up must come down. dont get caught.
69 2018-09-19 23:27:31 Well, that doesn't make it a great speculative bet *or* a good investment. There's no way to truly evaluate it meaningfully. I know plenty. Not everything, but enough to know it's a very bad thing to buy, at least for now. There's much more room to grow in stocks.
70 2018-09-19 23:26:38 Most Americans don’t have stocks nor a 401k, and stock market rise is due to stock buybacks from corporations that are not reinvesting and trickling down to employees in wages. Inflation has increased while wages stagnant. Deficit skyrocket and now GOP to cut SS, Medicaid, CHIP,

80 2018-09-19 23:18:58 Nothing like dropping statements with ‘increased jail terms’, ‘terrorism’, ‘will not tolerate’ - to push political stocks up.
81 2018-09-19 23:18:21 Yes debts up, assets up. Very low interest rates (for mortgages) pushing both up. Stocks vs flows.
82 2018-09-19 23:18:16 I try to stay out of stocks that the government can kill with one pen stroke
83 2018-09-19 23:16:59 On that other call I made...WTI oil at $71+ and cdn oil and gas names still trading as if it was $50. Get #TransMountain resolved and these stocks could be doing their best impression of the sexy nurse cannabis dance but with CF today and a future supply crunch still looming.

91 2018-09-19 23:12:50 Bought just 3 shares today (at 11.50) to get my big toe in the water of pot stocks, think it's going to be worth it in the long run?
92 2018-09-19 23:12:32 The top five stocks that closed lower today were $CPRT, $HFC, $VLO, $MPC, and $ANDV.
93 2018-09-19 23:12:28 To be clear: the only verifiable (as opposed to blather on Twitter) so-called "Cohodes shorts" I'm familiar with are $OSTK & Novastar---crap stocks shorted NOT by Cohodes personally but by Rocker Partners. 

The brains of the outfit was not Chicken Boy but David Rocker.
94 2018-09-19 23:11:45 I love casino stocks.

97 2018-09-19 23:10:04 Read charts. Read News. Read Financials. Read Financial Reports. Read Quarterlies. Read Disclosure Filings.

Read, read, read.

That's what gets you ahead with stocks.

Warren Buffett spends all his time reading.

There's probably a good reason.
98 2018-09-19 23:09:22 To your point of the $25 billion valuation. $MO has 50% market share in tobacco and has a valuation just over $100 billion. The eventual pot market will be highly fractured with way less barriers (and smaller margins) than tobacco. It's not like these stocks have a pot patent.

106 2018-09-19 23:06:02 You do realize stocks vary om a day to day basis right? Stock being down 1%   Doesn’t mean anything bad. No stock strictly goes up everyday. I’m sure the hate in you might not see that
107 2018-09-19 23:06:02 How many stocks do you normally hold at one time in your portfolio ?
108 2018-09-19 23:05:33 Here's how you can help (thanks for asking):
1. Universal background checks
2. A red flag law
3. Ban assault weapons and bump stocks
109 2018-09-19 23:05:29 my store stocks no fewer than a dozen varieties of these things. there's also strongbow's "cherry blossom" cider, which I think predates this fad.
110 2018-09-19 23:05:11 This is entirely rhetorical, because I know the answer is "Nothing! Are you kidding! I'm beholden to the NRA!", but:

What are you doing about gun violence, Donnie?  Breaking news on two separate mass shootings.  
Whatever happened to your EXTREME measure to ban bump stocks?
JHC
111 2018-09-19 23:04:18 similar but on a much narrower scale. today was the norm. and it was hundreds of stocks.
112 2018-09-19 23:03:32 The thing is though, all Chinese stocks usually move up and down together these days. Chart means something but not whole lot these days on these, imo.
113 2018-09-19 23:03:19 It's red now yes, I would definitely wait for the next green candle on the indicator before going long on $BTC.

As for stocks, it works well with any stock/coin. But I would recommend studying the charts first before making any trade. See how the indicator performed in the past.
114 2018-09-19 23:03:18 Find some charts from 1999. 100% in a day was not uncommon on stocks already running up.

134 2018-09-19 22:52:29 If they did they would have done it by now. The Gaon tracks stocks plus sales.
The sales haven't been meet to put the double million seller since a million sales haven't been made yet.
135 2018-09-19 22:52:25 Real homies short sell penny stocks
136 2018-09-19 22:51:52 Looks like as I slept tesla stock literally completely recovered

I coild have bought dip and made an extra 200 dollars if I times it right

But that's stocks for you, hindsight 2020
137 2018-09-19 22:50:36 @Zoella will both the Christmas collections be available in Australia? 
I know target stocks beauty products.
138 2018-09-19 22:50:33 _ ughh. i don’t understand how to buy stocks and i want too. i feel like missing out on learning that was like missing out on learning how to ride a bike. and if you still can’t ride a bike. idk if i trust you tbh.
139 2018-09-19 22:49:24 Losing on stocks on @RobinhoodApp :-)
140 2018-09-19 22:49:22 I'm thinking up, could see a bit of downside first but most cannabis stocks I personally believe will explode over the next year or so... Keep in mind that I'm not saying to go out and buy as I'm not a financial advisor.
141 2018-09-19 22:49:01 To many people chasing Pot stocks. Sooner or later investors will move on and buy other companies. The big question is “Is that’s before or after getting burned on pot stocks?”
142 2018-09-19 22:45:31  Have a look these #stocks that hit record highs: $BX, $AJG, $AON, $CINF, $AFL, $TD, $PGR
143 2018-09-19 22:44:54 Conversations with @IanVandaelle over a beer: things that Tilray is now bigger than. Common theme: they generate 1000x more in sales. Actually makes me glad I took 35% on the weed stocks when I did.
144 2018-09-19 22:44:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
145 2018-09-19 22:44:08 By the way, the indicator I mention in my pinned tweet works really well with stocks too ;)
146 2018-09-19 22:43:53 U have always presented very timely and realistic expectations of the Pot Stocks. I for one respect and value your judgment.
147 2018-09-19 22:43:40 apple stocks rise by 35%.
148 2018-09-19 22:41:29 Pretty crazy ride... let's see how many call pot stocks a "scam" after this bubble pops..

150 2018-09-19 22:40:17 Well although it's illegal two-hand a shoebox full of cash to a senator and expect favors. It is perfectly legal to hand them a shoebox full of stocks and expect favors for them.
151 2018-09-19 22:40:17 Hey baby, sorry can you meet me at Yaba tomorrow?
Just cross to the Left side, I have some new Italian stocks I want to show you, send me a Dm when you're there
152 2018-09-19 22:39:20 Sorry you feel that way. Still, there’s plenty of stocks out there that let you participate in their growth and give voting rights.
153 2018-09-19 22:38:55 For the stocks to give huge return, need to be loyal to it in good as well as bad times !
154 2018-09-19 22:38:53 There you guys go again! R.i.p. Pot stocks
155 2018-09-19 22:38:29 I have not looked into stats on the 10% number but yes, low floats are problematic. It should not be that difficult for regulators to come up with rules for these stocks.
156 2018-09-19 22:38:29 Im bringing all stocks to day one, but i most likely wont run out of them (i have around 50 pins each!)
157 2018-09-19 22:37:46 My pcd stocks. 
158 2018-09-19 22:36:49 Magnus pretending to be shocked when freeform starts losing stocks, and Alec just laughing because freeform was fucked anyway lmao
159 2018-09-19 22:35:23 Thank you @peterthiel for inspiring me to become a venture capitalist. It’s my dream to make billions from weed stocks, and you have already achieved it. Mad respect.
160 2018-09-19 22:34:54 Combining pot crypto coins with pot stocks sounds like the solution to success
161 2018-09-19 22:34:07 why am i getting a lecture on capitalism and stocks what class am i in
162 2018-09-19 22:32:55 Bitcoin crowd have jumped on weed stocks.

168 2018-09-19 22:29:34 @Thomas_Mapother you should have followed me into pot stocks!  Stupid exists!
169 2018-09-19 22:29:30 You said organizations to brainwash the world with their Lefty agenda and divide and conquer long game overtime. Oh and by a whole bunch of stocks and crashed the market on purpose because they have to use the money here they're communist such good people. Get a pair of balls ben
170 2018-09-19 22:29:23 I don’t like these kind of stocks which trending down my friend please stay away from them I think it’s going 167.50 it’s hard to tell maybe it will go down so your stop must be tight.
171 2018-09-19 22:27:45 Stocks are affected by speculation as well as implementation
172 2018-09-19 22:27:37 I REALLY need someone to sit down with me and help me understand stocks more. I get shorting but the rest of the process I’m kind of lost on. I just want to give someone my money and just make it grow for a small percentage 
173 2018-09-19 22:26:43 Bezos is worth more than the entire cannabis space (maybe by double?), Apple’s buyback program is worth more too I think. Interest rates have been negative.  But a handful of stocks have gone up a lot in a short period, yes. Crypto is truly unique imo
174 2018-09-19 22:25:55 stocks.
175 2018-09-19 22:24:56 Pot stocks will become the next dot-com bubble.

178 2018-09-19 22:23:18 It’s more of a place for people starting out in stocks.
179 2018-09-19 22:22:54 When the rich start selling their stocks.....this includes your investment company......
180 2018-09-19 22:22:51 These weed stocks are making crypto look mature.
181 2018-09-19 22:21:19 Does he want to buy some MJ or stocks? if MJ I know a guy that knows a guy
182 2018-09-19 22:20:22 It’ll be interesting when this price does fall. It’s gonna be big. Or not. Mary Jane stocks are bonkers.
183 2018-09-19 22:19:26 Just like Disabled people are not allowed to have any hobbies, interests, a life. See a person on benefits have any pleasure and it's a criminal offence worthy of being put in the Stocks.
184 2018-09-19 22:19:21 Once again tests done on fish stocks purchased in supermarkets and restaurants show it is like the heyday of the wild west. Customers are charged for expensive fish like Sole or Haddock and end up with garbage fish Pollock which until recently was tossed as unfit for consumption.
185 2018-09-19 22:18:56 does anyone know of any other cruelty free brands that do micellar water other than nyx... i love their one but literally no one else who stocks nyx stocks that product and i don’t want to order from their website cos i’m stubborn and refuse to pay delivery
186 2018-09-19 22:18:45 Remember my theory that Quality Stocks tend to recover after a Rights Issue if they have been troubled - so many examples of this and obvious recent one was #GFRD which is up maybe  80% on the Rights Shares.
187 2018-09-19 22:16:00 The Marijuana #ETF is up 63% since August 14th. What are you doing with pot stocks right now? $MJ $TLRY $WEED $CRON $ACB $GWPH

194 2018-09-19 22:11:56 Stocks or real estate?
195 2018-09-19 22:11:56 Agree and of that 3 billion it's not like that's pure liquid cash flow. A lot is probably tied up in stocks, real estate and businesses he owns. It's not 3 billion cash in the bank. This is a big sum of money to throw in one place even for a "billionaire on paper"
196 2018-09-19 22:11:56 This happens all the time but many docs not aware as pharmacy do best to source alternatives at hugely inflated prices. Only when we cannot get stocks or need to ration then we let them know, currently lorazepam iv, hartmans, recently ondansetron, daily problem
197 2018-09-19 22:11:35 Anyone following stocks see how wild TLRY has been?! Funny that a fairly new marijuana company got to be worth more than American Airlines and CBS within a few days #gethighbaby 
198 2018-09-19 22:11:34 I am long SHOP, now long JD and IQ. Both those Chinese stocks will pay off big time by next earnings reports.

204 2018-09-19 22:10:20 Considering it was likely a pump & dump by an insider group much like “Reminiscences of a Stock Operator”  days, you would think the SEC would be all over it.  I personally couldn’t pump stocks to a retail audience knowing they’ll get run over.
205 2018-09-19 22:09:53 Our yearly debt stocks is almost half of what Ghana (Africa) loses to foreign companies yearly as tax concessions. smfh. It’s sad.

220 2018-09-19 21:57:30 I’m disappointed that none of my friends texted me about cannabis stocks yet
221 2018-09-19 21:57:26 The top five stocks that closed higher today were $BWA, $NFX, $PX. $ETFC, and $C.
222 2018-09-19 21:57:02 @Apple iOS 12 update sorted. Nothing to rave about but it is indeed faster. However, they still don’t learn. Reinstalling Stocks; adding a new Voice Memo and Measuring app without consent. Behave like @Microsoft and people treat you like that and walk away.

231 2018-09-19 21:51:48 have you look into stocks related to weed?
232 2018-09-19 21:51:00 At least, with the stock market, you can pick a stock with growth potential. This can be calculated in a number of ways. Computer stocks had amazing growth potential because the market for computers was growing. Bitcoin has none, other than hype and the usual BS.
233 2018-09-19 21:50:40 All mine is a ‘working theory’ informed by massive Confirmation Bias and subject to change. Like “I’m going to hold these stocks till it’s a trillion dollar industry...” take with Grains of salt.

238 2018-09-19 21:48:09 The things you hear sitting at a table in Nairobi. A guy who runs a fish company bought large stocks of anti - venom. This is also trolling that man. ;)
239 2018-09-19 21:48:06 My stocks are doing some weird, weird shit today
240 2018-09-19 21:47:08 It's going back up now after hours. But yea you. Gotta be careful with some of the cheaper stocks like that. They can have a lot of volatility. So you have to make sure you aren't the type to panic when you see your money going down. Or get to excited when it's going up

242 2018-09-19 21:46:27 Coca Cola getting into the weed investing game made my stocks go up in value. Made like 10$. It’s not much but I didn’t have to work for it
243 2018-09-19 21:45:30 Anybody else see the massive pump and dump of cannabis stocks (specifically Tilray) today that seemed to directly coincide with the dump and rally of bitcoin and the crypto market?

a reseller i trust stocks it, but it's like $35 through them. bah.
247 2018-09-19 21:42:49 this is the best argument for bringing back the stocks. Anyone that endangers the herd immunity should be shamed.

251 2018-09-19 21:40:51 Theres a massivr global debt crisis. Stocks in the US are over valued. There will be a crash. The US dollar as a reserve currency will end. The FEDs new coin will hopefully be good enough to keep americans out of a major crisis.

264 2018-09-19 21:35:49 I picked up some garbage penny stocks several months ago. I hope this thing goes into a crazy bubble (at which instant I sell). We'll see how this ends up, but I'm pretty much even so far.

290 2018-09-19 21:27:54 Big stocks guy. Diversify your funds.
291 2018-09-19 21:26:42 Maybe special interest will let the public buy pot stocks like Tilray from 17 too 300. When it gets back to 30 they will let us buy in.
292 2018-09-19 21:26:35 Cannabis stocks did so well today
293 2018-09-19 21:25:12 key support/resistance on all these pot stocks lol.   Even TLRY top was 240 this AM which is a combo of 420.
294 2018-09-19 21:24:14 Hope you guys talk about Tilray (TLRY) and cannabis stocks madness.

302 2018-09-19 21:19:28 Please dont let this comment go unnoticed. I have been on a + streak & have learned a lot from OS. I have deleted my watchlist of 40+ stocks & have been focusing on 5 tickers. I love what you do, despite being a big community and would love to be apart of it
303 2018-09-19 21:19:11 Hey bro can you tell me where you buy stocks?? And even where do you trade your stocks?
304 2018-09-19 21:18:37 I think if we look at the bubble from december - feb this year in canadian pot stocks we can expect similar retracement from the big bubblers recently. At which point, many of them have a clear bottom support/channel at which you would want to buy. Did it all last year.
305 2018-09-19 21:18:04 Delay tactic. Shame
306 2018-09-19 21:17:24 Just make acquisitions and your now guilty till proven innocent you don’t even have to testify. Such  obvious delay tactic hurts the #MeToo movement. Shame

309 2018-09-19 21:17:06 I don’t see it as any different to trading long, just the opposite! I am shorting WAY more lately because stocks are going down. Can’t go long all the time! Short the weak long the strong!
310 2018-09-19 21:17:04 I do not trade options but like tonread your thoughts on the stocks. Ty for your posts
311 2018-09-19 21:16:41 Have you ever bought puts on something like this?  I know you like to short these types of stocks, but buying puts is less risk and don't have to worry about getting locates.  The negative is the time decay and massive premium on them.
312 2018-09-19 21:16:38 What is the name of the uranium stock? All my uranium stocks are down at least 30% or more. I have been holding these uranium stocks for couple years now.
313 2018-09-19 21:16:36 I just wish someone could explain the market forces that drive these dramatic value swings. It seems not just unpredictable but also irrational. Values don’t seem to have any correlation to stocks, currencies or commodities. So irrationality & no regulation seems a bit scary.
314 2018-09-19 21:15:41 Yes... Smart investors know stocks don't trade on valuation, or price targets

Future potential is VERY important

336 2018-09-19 21:06:37 Dude, I doubt stocks were going downs $50 within ten minutes of opening then up another $120 only to go down $140 with 50 minutes and then up another $50 to end the day. You will never see this again.

338 2018-09-19 21:06:33 Stocks are overvalued and treasuries are overbought as at the moment they’re at the sweetest spot in regards to their Sharpe ratio compared to other asset classes. Other asset classes need to offer either higher cash flow or lower risk in order to move themselves up.

395 2018-09-19 20:44:44 The problem with "pot stocks" is, with government's hands all over the commodity, the product will be inferior, so the Illegal trade will still flourish, and legal profits and revenues will disappoint.

409 2018-09-19 20:38:47 Leaving a side the obvious lack of journalism in a propaganda unit, The people of Liverpool made a choice, no one stocks the rag in Liverpool, The Sun is synonymous with Scum, that's why they're not welcome.

411 2018-09-19 20:37:59 Today's Market = Midweek Nap

Overall market today ended mostly unchanged, but stocks hurt recently by the China-US tensions have started to find their stride. Not sure if that's hopefulness or comfort in uncertainty...

S&P 500: 2,907.95

412 2018-09-19 20:37:11 I tend the agree but these are real growth businesses. TLRY action is a cancer to the rest of the space. It’s unfortunate. Many great stocks still down YTD and will become cheaper

417 2018-09-19 20:34:30 You and @FeeFo247 need to have a tech/business-savvy podcast where you discuss tech companies and start ups and stocks. I still listen to that one episode y'all did a while back. It would def be a success

419 2018-09-19 20:33:37 I’ve made more money in 3 days trading stocks than I would if I worked for a month 
420 2018-09-19 20:33:35 Haha sometimes trading these stocks it feels like your on drugs. A lot of highs and a lot of lows
421 2018-09-19 20:33:31 I refuse to sell with $cron refuse. $TLRY stocks are already back around $200 a share. Let the market go ape shit in the morning again. ’s.
422 2018-09-19 20:33:21 cannabis stocks = bitcoin in Oct-Nov 2017. In a few months , they all going to get wiped out. Mark my words.
423 2018-09-19 20:32:53 Shout out to cass for putting me on to those marijuana stocks 
424 2018-09-19 20:32:52 If you were theoretically () running a VC firm focused on cannabis right now, you would invest in small private companies with proper science and strong branding, while simultaneously hedging by shorting a basket of publicly traded “pot stocks.” 2/2 #Cannabis $TLRY
425 2018-09-19 20:32:45 It’s already trading down in the after hours ....to bad it’s gonna take better valued pot stocks down with it. Fucking bullshit
426 2018-09-19 20:32:25 I've theorized that the $TLRY is a phenomenon of either (a) crypto-traders jumping into pot stocks or (b) a battle between powerful computer algorithms.

I was leaning hard to option (a), but after today I'm starting to lean option (b).
427 2018-09-19 20:31:28 That child’s post history is just hilarious. The dumb stocks she pumps and then shits on others. She wild
428 2018-09-19 20:31:20 Explains why Israel has NEVER signed up to International Criminal Court, International Agreements on Nuclear Disarmament, International Agreement on Chemical Weapons. Israel continues to hold enormous stocks of Chemical Warfare Weaponry+Unknown number but thought 100+ Nukes
429 2018-09-19 20:31:13 the stocks market? its a snap, every day it goes up or down. but hitting an expertly pitched curve ball, that takes finesse. whatever baseball guys get paid it isn't enough
430 2018-09-19 20:29:26 I can't imagine what 1999 would have been like with Twitter and internet stocks.

Probably pretty close to cannabis, minus the Superbowl commercials
431 2018-09-19 20:28:58 Or maybe it’s just the Canadian pot stocks
432 2018-09-19 20:28:55 So, if you didn't believe that anything is possible in the stock market then you learned something today. Anything is possible, there are even penny stocks with a $200 price tag... $TLRY
433 2018-09-19 20:28:46 Traded $RHT for 2+ points during day and 4.5 points in 1 minute after hours after earnings dip, awesome stuff! #PTL #Trading #Stocks
434 2018-09-19 20:28:33 Okay that's it I want in the Weed stocks .
435 2018-09-19 20:27:11 #S&P500 and the #DowJones rose on Wednesday, as bank stocks gained on rising Treasury yields, while a drop in #Microsoft pressured the #Nasdaq
436 2018-09-19 20:26:41 lol, they are efficient if the time line is long enough, I always have in my mind the statistic that just 4% of stocks over time account for most of the Index gains since 1930, and 96% don't outperform 2 yr treasuries over time
437 2018-09-19 20:26:08 Can you imagine the cocaine stocks?
438 2018-09-19 20:25:58 A few hours ago It was posted that cannabis stocks were being compared to Bitcoin gains.  All I can say is welcome to the world of crypto after a fall like that 
439 2018-09-19 20:25:25 As investors chase pot stocks rally, some show caution: 'This is just stupid time' - CNBC
440 2018-09-19 20:25:01 From $20 to $300 in 60 days. First bitcoin, now the pot stocks. Everyone is after the quick buck. Always ends in a crash.
441 2018-09-19 20:24:40 Thank you so much much appreciated. I really don't know according to the dispatch order it says 4 to 5 weeks, but hopefully I'd get it earlier. I think I'll see if I can get the iPhone XS Max this Friday. If there are no stocks it's ok.

Traded $IGC $MTEM $NBEV $NIO

Ready to make more tomorrow, see you in the morning!
445 2018-09-19 20:23:49 Since the Obama administration It has been wise to be greedy. The Fed has put plenty of cash on the street to goose stocks.
446 2018-09-19 20:22:50 This is reminding me so much of 1999. Pot stocks are the tech stocks.
447 2018-09-19 20:22:47 I love watching the #StockMarket #news for tirades of post hoc explanations!

450 2018-09-19 20:22:13 What a stupid take. Gosh. Hey how are those Nike stocks doing?
451 2018-09-19 20:21:43 For as many traders as there are that are saying they aren't touching $TLRY, it sure is still clogging up my damn feed. Can we get back to stocks that people actually trade now?
452 2018-09-19 20:21:35 both low float stocks with lots of dumb retail money flowing in to them, makes sense
453 2018-09-19 20:21:22 Stock investing. The names change. But the game remains the same. Why? Emotions don't change. The emotions of fear and greed.  #stocks
454 2018-09-19 20:20:44 I love azealia she tanked elons stocks with some screenshots and was then just like "buy my soap :)"
455 2018-09-19 20:20:38 these pot stocks are a different animal,
 take a step back and recuperate bro !
456 2018-09-19 20:20:21 #SEC should take notice, Cramer touting stocks with hardly no float
457 2018-09-19 20:18:58 Which of the following auto stocks do you think will do the best over the next 6-12 months?

458 2018-09-19 20:18:42 Do you know about ARNICA gel ?

My friend is a homeopath & she has directed me to it.
She said it speeds healing time.  And gives some pain relief.  

Walmart carries the ARNICA  gel. 

(No, I  don't own stocks in WM.  Just need the low prices LOL ) 
459 2018-09-19 20:18:38 My presence or lack of doesn’t boost your ego, it boosts the stocks. Credit ballers exit stage left. No rusheez.
460 2018-09-19 20:18:12 who are these people who keep saying nothing trades except pot stocks? i'm sure all the twitter geniuses reinvested their tilray gains into the qqq lows
461 2018-09-19 20:17:53 Stocks that move 30 points in each direction in 15 minutes with 12 million is salesare a travesty
462 2018-09-19 20:17:45 Stocks end mostly lower in a day of wide divergences. Dow +158, +0.6% to 26,405 on gains in financials and big industrials. But S&P +0.1%, Nasdaq -0.08%. Smaller stocks even weaker: Russell 2000 -0.5%.

Losers edge winners 16 to 13 on NYSE and Nasdaq.
463 2018-09-19 20:17:33 Cannabis stocks/industry going mad, how do I integrate cannabis into furniture to hop on this bandwagon. $tlry $cron
464 2018-09-19 20:17:11 Every year pot stocks rally and dump. Little like crypto
465 2018-09-19 20:16:37 Interesting tidbit of the day - Tilray's market cap is greater than half of the S&P 500 stocks, despite having less than $10 million in revenue. Sounds like a FOMO and short covering trade.

#investments #markets
466 2018-09-19 20:16:26 Remember when then Fed-chair Janet Yellen said stocks might be overvalued? Yeah, good times!
467 2018-09-19 20:16:11 Stocks literally got high today.  Blue chip (775 time revenues) Canadian cannabis producer, Tilray, traded in a nice tight range of 151 pts, or 94% above yesterday's close. Apparently the US DEA suggests it will import cannabis for medical studies - shorts were decimated.
468 2018-09-19 20:16:00 Hey there. Are you experiencing any specific issues with the Stocks app, or are you looking to provide feedback about the changes?
469 2018-09-19 20:15:30 Pot stocks is where you should've invested some money. The more legal it's becoming the higher the stocks will rise. Look at Tilray
470 2018-09-19 20:15:30 World stocks edge higher: Europe +.3%; S&P 500 +.1%. Investors believe trade issues will be solved soon & this is priced into overall market. Means there is more downside risk than upside potential. But market will react sharply either way. Rising interest-rates not yet an issue.
471 2018-09-19 20:15:15 Damn missed the weed stock craziness because of practice. Played $CRON long in the morning. Cant wait for the weed stocks and all their fucking short traps to die.

488 2018-09-19 20:10:21 Have you considered that people who but marijuana stocks are likely the same people who smoke the stuff? That would explain some of the valuations.
489 2018-09-19 20:09:57 "Chasing" is not a viable tactic. #stocks
490 2018-09-19 20:09:20 The weed stocks?
491 2018-09-19 20:09:07 Another decent day for stocks with rates steepening again. Slowly but surely normalizing here but I don’t see rates running away unless the ECB really unwinds their QE. Goldilocks action for now. Let’s enjoy it.
492 2018-09-19 20:08:52 Once Trump goes ahead with the harsher tariffs, I will. This one and some other China fake stocks have been great for shorts this year, as longs are like deer in headlights. I made good money on BABA last year on the long side but the margin profile has really deteriorated!
493 2018-09-19 20:08:32 FYI United health Care, Cigna, Aetna and Blue Cross (!NOW Sit Down Julie). THERE stocks went up 40 Percent last Year. There MOTO" You want it, We Got it, BEND OVER !!!!!!!

496 2018-09-19 20:07:08 In DC for a roundtable discussion of small companies having access to equity markets. With the number of small-cap stocks dwindling, this is an important conversation, especially for individual investors who have the advantage in this market segment.
497 2018-09-19 20:07:01 Only 28% of NYSE stocks are trading at least one channel above the 40 week ma.
498 2018-09-19 20:06:53 No/yes I did back when I started building my portfolio. I will definitely be getting back into trading as soon as I get some $ and stocks bought
499 2018-09-19 20:06:26 Weed stocks bonkers AF
500 2018-09-19 20:05:58 Already in the Weed-Stocks since 3 years with great profits. It's clear that many States in the US need more Tax- Income to operate, that'll be one of the reasons for Legalizations. But be carefully where to invest because of the Revers Splits.. Better go for POT- & THC-Coins.
501 2018-09-19 20:05:43 So, how long does the fund intend to hold onto stocks that successfully breakout?
502 2018-09-19 20:05:14 Nothing to do with it my treatment cannot be produced in this country,stocks wont last long. And then who knows
503 2018-09-19 20:05:10 What Exchanges do people use to buy these stocks?

517 2018-09-19 20:00:05 I try not to post about stocks much, but this morning I did post that it would bump 300.
But... Just a lucky random guess.
518 2018-09-19 20:00:02 What do you think of these new cannabis stocks? Are you in that market?
519 2018-09-19 19:59:32 It's impossible to know what happens in the next month. If you're a buy & hold long investor, just stop watching. 
If you're a day or swing trader, flip a coin. These stocks could be at $100 billion in January. They could also be at $2b. Neither would surprise.
520 2018-09-19 19:59:21 When i was 1 month into melee, @ArmadaUGS needed housing and so i was lucky enough to house him for a week where he battered me with 80% 4 stocks. I asked him to what to do to get better, and he told me to get my punish game super good

And then I became reaction tech chase guy
521 2018-09-19 19:59:19 I think the impact of Cobinhood, Simple FX etc have just been realized.  Btc paird to stocks direct will have an even greater importance for BTC’ true form which IMO is a frictionless indices token/hedge against ALL major assets.
522 2018-09-19 19:59:08 Tired from watching stocks and posting all day and now my sister needs help moving a dresser in storage. A trip to get  a bottle of whiskey later then to put me to sleep. Plane trip mid day.
523 2018-09-19 19:58:55 Well, I’m guilty of taking advantage of a one day 60%  gain when Netlist $NLST jumped a couple weeks ago. But turned around and bought value stocks with the profits. I really don’t want to try that again though. 
524 2018-09-19 19:58:52 Not time yet. It's values of the stocks will be up and down options

530 2018-09-19 19:56:44 not sure why folks bother about $tlry unless they have cash to gamble big time. several stocks trading nicely in range like $amzn $splk $msft $aapl etc and these are risk free and give plenty of cash.

532 2018-09-19 19:56:23 I pick stocks, gold and silver.   Venezuela started a crypto currency.  Is their crypto  worth about the same as the others? Venezuela backs their crypto with something as opposed to the others backed by nothing.
533 2018-09-19 19:56:08 Half the stocks I track on my screen are down at least 1% today. Growth is still under some distribution here.
534 2018-09-19 19:56:01 Most likely because they bought at the highs and are blaming other investors or the company for the decreasing share price. I see it happen on many stocks.

537 2018-09-19 19:55:37 Most retail brokers CANT EVEN BUY POT STOCKS @CGasparino 

You don’t know what you’re talking about.

And it’s still ILLEGAL

The cryptobubble/bust is back, this time in the form of pot stocks.

541 2018-09-19 19:54:40 Tout dépends des stocks qu'ils ont réussi à avoir. Il y a aussi du stock sur ShopTo et Base (plus cher à 103 et 107,99 €). Et aussi de la communication et des habitudes de précommandes qui diffèrent selon les pays. 
Et aussi du fait qu'Amazon Uk a tendance à annuler

544 2018-09-19 19:53:35 @FoxBusiness be careful investing in Pot Stocks from other countries. without the right "SIGNED" trade deal it could be dicey
545 2018-09-19 19:53:32 Watching these pot stocks fly up, down, and all around; reminds me of the good old days in #crypto .... o wait that was only 8 months ago ... $BTC and #alts will rise again don't worry. But until then boost my Pot Bags by enjoying a joint and CBD Soda with @elonmusk
546 2018-09-19 19:53:31 The craziest thing I have ever seen trading stocks is $TLRY today.

550 2018-09-19 19:53:06 @BullyEsq I wonder if we are watching the new legal Silk Road today, people are buying weed (stocks), profiting, then selling weed (stocks) for $BTC haha now we can deal drugs legally just like the FEDS!!
551 2018-09-19 19:53:05 Between the $XIV bomb and weed stocks, 2018 has been way more exciting than 2017.
552 2018-09-19 19:52:56 Just giving respect where its due, buddy. These clowns have no place talking about stocks. They make that very clear.

554 2018-09-19 19:52:51 @Speeders258 Hello. I'm a Canadian business journalist. Any chance I can speak with you about your experience trading pot stocks? I'm at dberman at globeandmail dot com.
555 2018-09-19 19:51:38 Other point is that there was a suite of policies for stabilizing prices of primary goods (buffer stocks, etc) that came out of restrictionist policies of interwar & that were to be at center of postwar settlement but that are ignored in monetary-centric accounts of Bretton Woods
556 2018-09-19 19:51:33 So basically a huge quick drop and then short any bounce? Where can you short these stocks?
557 2018-09-19 19:51:19 Looking for stock ideas? 420 stocks may be what you’re looking for.
558 2018-09-19 19:50:53 And I take issue with you using the label socialist to describe literal billionaires who own entire factories and millions in stocks and assets and force people into wage slavery...
559 2018-09-19 19:50:38 Is there real value in having so many hyper-intelligent individuals working in HFT if the main social benefit is that stocks have priced a fraction of a second faster? #jacksonbigdata

566 2018-09-19 19:49:32 Hear me out, I have an idea. How bout we let stocks trade, instead of halting and unhalting them down/up $50?!!! $TLRY
567 2018-09-19 19:49:13 Tough tweet Mark. How about bull longterm, but not buying most public stocks at current valuations.
568 2018-09-19 19:48:52 Lol seems like the cryptocurrency community is starting to warm-up to stocks.
569 2018-09-19 19:48:50 The 1000% moves I have seen many times before, but on much, much smaller stocks. The market cap on this one is just amazing.
570 2018-09-19 19:48:31 WOW. Last minute profit taking in the pot stocks or what??? They were doing well until about 30 min before closing bell. You must b busy? Miss your input today.

588 2018-09-19 19:45:26 Marijuana stocks are going to be the next big speculative industry. Similar to social media stocks now or internet stocks in the early 2000s.

590 2018-09-19 19:44:58 Stocks like Tilroy are why I tend to stay away from OTC stocks.  It’s out of control.  Huge swings.
591 2018-09-19 19:44:53 @jfahmy @optionstrader32 100% agree on both points. In 1999 there were 100s of stocks making $TLRY moves, 5-10 on daily basis. IPOs pricing @ $15, opening @ $75. This is not euphoria, it’s tiny piece of the market, getting squeezed like crypto was #investing #trading #TomsTruths
592 2018-09-19 19:44:51 Watching the fiasco with $TLRY . What is happening is a disgrace to the USA stock market, the @SEC_Enforcement , the @Nasdaq and the trading regulations on thinly traded stocks

596 2018-09-19 19:44:23 I’ve never had so much fun / almost had a heart attack at work in my life. Thanks, cannabis stocks. See you tomorrow!
597 2018-09-19 19:44:03 think im gonna jump into the stocks/ trading game next year
598 2018-09-19 19:44:02 It’s crazy, these stocks trade so high pre market and after market hours then during normal trading hours they come back down to normal price, can’t compare to bitcoin bc the industry and product is actually real lol
599 2018-09-19 19:43:39 $TLRY alright now that we've finally gotten rid of the elephant in the room we can all go back to our regular fucking lives trading normal pot stocks now. I DO NOT - expect this $TLRY bullshit to linger too long with the rest of the sector. The weak hands will get shook here.

651 2018-09-19 19:32:03 Keep in mind, it can also break out to the upside (lower odds of that but not 0% of course) like last November. Usually not a good sign when stocks go farther higher than expected as we saw in late January/late February. The fluff usually gets corrected rapidly

668 2018-09-19 19:29:17 For once I disagree professor. Respectfully, both companies have reached a Trillion because of quantitative easing and the flow of money back into stocks because of historical low yields in bonds for a sustained period of time.
669 2018-09-19 19:28:57 Hypocrisy while millions of Americans mainly minorities can't vote nor have a opportunity caused by a criminal record for possession of marijuana is the name pot ect. On wallstreet billions of dollars are invested in the same drugs legally through stocks every day ?

684 2018-09-19 19:24:52 Lol my point exactly. At one point the Market Cap was at $23Bln and their annual revenue is $30M.. you don't have to follow stocks to know something is wrong with those number lmao

689 2018-09-19 19:24:14 No matter if you give me a follow or not just wanted to let you know I really learned alot from you and your style . Especially the cash out mentality and narrow focus on stocks. Made me better thx

691 2018-09-19 19:23:00 This is what happens when stoners start trading stocks
692 2018-09-19 19:22:36 It appears ALL pot stocks are reacting to $TLRY supernova/ trade halts.  Sympathy plays galore.
693 2018-09-19 19:22:27 I'm supposed to accept the product of your hypothetical, wild imagination instead of celebrating high stocks, raises, stopping the apologizing for American exceptionalism, getting my tax dollars out of liberal fake causes, & ending Obama/Holder racism? I'll stick with reality.
694 2018-09-19 19:22:01 Please tell me how $TLRY dictates what else happens to these pot stocks. What a joke these people are. Smh
695 2018-09-19 19:21:48 I thought stocks were for old people in suits to pull a +10% over 6 months

I am a beginner and learnt a lot from your tweets about trading only limited stocks with high risk management, I hope you can add me someday to your private Twitter. Thanks a lot for your guidance.

718 2018-09-19 19:15:57 It's like the hit a switch once some/most stocks get to a certain level.

728 2018-09-19 19:13:50 Right before getting halted for volatility, $TLRY nearly doubled in price at its session high, hitting $300. Its market cap jumped to nearly $28 billion, which made it a bigger stock than 59% of the stocks in the $SPX. For a moment, $TLRY was bigger than $M, $GPS, $MAT combined.
729 2018-09-19 19:13:50 I sold all of my pot stocks just now. Huge profits. The bubble will burst especially for $TLRY this is a massive short squeeze that will play out.

755 2018-09-19 19:07:18 Is it eligible for S&P500 membership?  Then a flood of passive investment money would come into the stock.  Not going to happen, but thinking about it illustrates the tendency of passive investors push overvalued stocks higher.
756 2018-09-19 19:07:12 They Buying back they own stocks that's what the companies doing ... I can't believe you think tax cuts help you ... wow
757 2018-09-19 19:07:01 $TLRY Just talking about it on Closing Bell on CNBC....they will be talking about it further later in the show.  Going to be interesting as they are saying it's overbought.

765 2018-09-19 19:04:52 Happiness (El-sa3ada) is the result of choosing to be a kind, caring, compassionate and gentle person with self & others. Pleasure (El-laza) is a momentary feeling that comes from something external such as a good meal, our stocks going up, making love and so on.

772 2018-09-19 19:03:34 Yest I said 5 biz days to be safe, But I’ve noticed over the several months a lot of the trend reversals (however big/small) happened on a Wed.  So I personally expect tomorrow to start selling off.  Russell2000 is weak, tech stocks are weak...not much steam left for Spx.
773 2018-09-19 19:03:33 1. This sector is just starting out, so it’s a little (a lot) more volatile than older, established industries. 2. I always advise investors as follows: ensure you have access to a financial/investment advisor; consider holding a basket of stocks in this sector.

782 2018-09-19 19:00:24 What if they have 20% of their assets in crypto currencies or single stocks on @RobinhoodApp ? Then is 70/30 “extremely conservative” now? Probably not. This type of generalization is why having an individual advisor has so much value.
783 2018-09-19 19:00:16 WELCOME TO BINANCE.  All the crypto nerds moved to Weed stocks.  They don't know it yet, but they all about to get WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEd!
784 2018-09-19 18:59:29 imagine what Finance Twitter would've looked like in 1998-2000.  Weren't there like a dozen Tilrays?   random  .COM stocks were doing this all the time?
785 2018-09-19 18:59:24 Now watch as all the price action moves into other Weed stocks.
786 2018-09-19 18:58:21 Haha was thinking the same. $TLRY looking like $BTC when it was at 20k and @CNBC Shilling cannabis related stocks now

797 2018-09-19 18:55:10 The number of public stocks is declining which could not be due to repurchase of all stock by company unless it somehow takes itself private without an M&A deal. I suspect companies are being taken private and new public IPOs are not so frequent.
798 2018-09-19 18:55:07 Bought my first stocks today. I feel so grown up 
799 2018-09-19 18:55:02 I’m going to go out on a limb and say Weed Stocks will be a big bust.

I see the market as a fraction of what the big bulls think.

802 2018-09-19 18:54:13 I always hesitate to buy hugely squeezed low float stocks especially from pot sector for 2 reasons:
(1) Greed: hold for too long and eat a huge loss at the end
(2) Panic: sell my position way too early for (possible) small gain

820 2018-09-19 18:46:55 Why would we not take into account risk preference, though? I've never had a client's risk score at 80% stocks, let alone 90%+ "as expected." I would focus on the things we can control like savings and earning power, rather than risk that isn't aligned to tolerance. My 2 cents :)

831 2018-09-19 18:41:57 How does one not "deliberately" short stocks?
832 2018-09-19 18:41:35 This doesn’t even make sense.
The richest people in America, the top 20% own 92% 
of stocks.
That leaves 8% ownership for 80% of Americans. 
How many of the devastated after Florence, are in that top 20%?
They may have retirement funds, they can take from and possibly pay penalty

844 2018-09-19 18:38:24 Theoretically it's a dog's breakfast, confusing stocks v flows, equilibrium v disequilibrium, etc. That was the point the older Hicks made. But all models are wrong. Some are wrong and useful.

873 2018-09-19 18:27:47 Nice offer! Let me make sure it isn't available in a store here. It probably is at one place (stocks unusual-for-her things like that). I'll go check.

You get desperate to promote the "next big thing” while tagging the stocks you were too dense to understand. Sad story here.
882 2018-09-19 18:24:08 Mr. President your ridiculous trade policy is slamming my investments.  You are harming farmers and laying the seeds for an economic disaster.  When we all start unloading stocks and the bankrupt farmers realize your policy is breaking them, where will your reelection bid be?

889 2018-09-19 18:22:29 Wow that’s nice I appreciate your tweet , my feelings are if this was really sincere, why does Colin not give the money Nike has paid him too help his cause , or even better , why does Nike not do the same thing ? Instead of bragging about how the stocks have risen since the ad !

really common in penny stocks
894 2018-09-19 18:20:44 I'm not predicting anything - I've said that multiple times here and in the post. The whole point of my article is to rethink being overweight stocks in 2018 and going forward. Risk management and timing the market are two different concepts.

898 2018-09-19 18:20:08 My bullcase is The divergent bottom in spring , it looks ‘unfinished’. If inflation (in commodities gold energy) really kicks in it will inflate stocks as well imho. For as long as it lasts... and I see bottoming patterns in metals like copper. Natgas, and oil still bullish.

901 2018-09-19 18:19:27 they’ll ban fur before they ban bump stocks 
902 2018-09-19 18:19:03 Lots of talk about divergence in the market as of late. I think much of this has to do with a strong dollar and trade war worries. A number of stocks are directly affected by these headlines.
903 2018-09-19 18:17:30 I have some, and it hasn’t been for the faint of heart lately, but still one of the best pot stocks to own.  My opinion of course.

910 2018-09-19 18:15:38 New to #DayTrading #Stocks? 

Before every trade, ask yourself: 

“Does this have the power to continue in the same direction for the rest of the day?”

If it doesn’t, find something else!

If it’s a swing, it better have the power to continue for weeks or months

Cannabis stocks probably have a way to go but day(s) of reckoning coming either way.

920 2018-09-19 18:12:42 Henry Morris (young earth creationist) has said that blacks were destined for servitude and physical labor, Jews for a spiritual life and whites for intellectual achievement "because of the innate natures of the three genetic stocks".

931 2018-09-19 18:09:18 ohhh see...so the plan is to get the younger generation to pump the pot stocks. Lol  you're forgetting that crypto was so enticing because of the tales of 1000x and new tech.
932 2018-09-19 18:08:39 $btc and stocks are gonna switch markets pretty soon
933 2018-09-19 18:08:05 Are you better off sorting on multiple value metrics, or just one (combined w/a profitability sort)?

Non-US stocks (last 10yrs):

MSCI EAFE Value (multiple) = +3.5%
DFA Int'l Large Value Index (single) = +4.5%

MSCI EM Value (multiple) = +2.4%
DFA EM Value Index (single) = +4.2%
934 2018-09-19 18:08:05 John, how much of a raise did you get this year? 1%? Or were you born with a silver spoon in your mouth? Wages not up. Not winning the trade battle, we haven't seen the end yet. Stocks up & down.  Did you brag when Obama brought us out of a recession caused by Bush? Probably not.

961 2018-09-19 18:00:36 So Cronos and TLRY are two different stocks (companies)?
962 2018-09-19 18:00:12 And no doubt with as much follow through as the administration did with banning bump stocks.
963 2018-09-19 17:59:49 I think everyone FOMO'd from Crypto into Marijuana stocks.

966 2018-09-19 17:59:11 In a profile I read while ago, the guy who came up with it valued his brand at $3B, a large portion of whatever he's worth. As with publicly traded stocks, and absent an acquirer who's willing to pay for it, it will get written off or disappear completely in a scandal.  ;-)
967 2018-09-19 17:58:37 The chart shows contribution to S&P 500 index gains (i.e. stocks' weight in the index * % gain) since the Feb lows. Several mid caps are up big indeed, but their index weights are too small to matter at the index level
968 2018-09-19 17:58:19 $SECI $8.90 Great call Sara! Congrats
969 2018-09-19 17:57:18 Q tiene $CRON q tenga $TLRY a nivel de fundamentales ?

971 2018-09-19 17:57:08 Seeing quite a few promoted tweets to,  gone from crypto back to stocks and indexes.
972 2018-09-19 17:56:53 Speak for yourself, sir. Glad to see you're doing so well... You're gonna need that $20 dollar profit margin from your risky stocks when the bottom falls out the economy. #ChoicesHaveConsequences
973 2018-09-19 17:56:48 Pffft, can't even compensate for the speed of light? I think SpaceX stocks are about to drop like 300 points. #idontknowwhatimtalkingabout
974 2018-09-19 17:55:11 $JPM breaking out of an 8 month base to new all-time highs is probably not good for the bear case for stocks either $SPX

979 2018-09-19 17:54:36 I should have invested in marijuana stocks months ago! I’m glad, I’m not too late to the party now
980 2018-09-19 17:54:26 What about kohls ,sysco eli lilly. There up more than 25% each? There are plenty of stocks up over 20% since then.
981 2018-09-19 17:54:13 I remember walkin' 
Didn't have a dollar in my pocket
Now I'm watching stocks like whats the options

Ooh ooh
How life's changed
982 2018-09-19 17:53:49 While $TLRY and $TSLA are both pretty sweet stocks, I am going to give the Parsimony guarantee that they will converge. And it's not going to be because $TLRY keeps going up...
983 2018-09-19 17:52:41 The underlying strength in the Indian IT stocks can be witnessed by the resilience and strength IT stock prices have shown in an otherwise weak market. They indeed benefit from the rising rupee but the volatility in the rupee is not reflecting in volatility in their stock prices.
984 2018-09-19 17:51:53 Follow me on tradingview for my coverage of the pot stocks. Will likely be trading them one day. Is looking like the short of the century. One has 30B market cap and only 8M in yearly sales. No intellectual property or barrier to entry. Frothy. 30B on 8M.
985 2018-09-19 17:50:38 Having an overdraft can become really dangerous 
986 2018-09-19 17:50:21 Will the industry continue to overproduce through that time or run low enough to break stocks down so they aren't 8% over last year?
987 2018-09-19 17:50:06 Stocks...r fun @Jellyra_
988 2018-09-19 17:48:52 maybe you should save your stocks and give exo a comeback
989 2018-09-19 17:48:42 $splk and most cloud stocks (and the high one's like 120, 150, 170 etc) trade in air pockets. meaning the bid will get moved on but no one will trade lol. you establish a place and buy the foolish sellers who are selling 15 down in 2 days!
990 2018-09-19 17:48:21 The option market is too expensive for these stocks but hoping you cash out on yours
991 2018-09-19 17:47:37 How you select stocks (basic screening) step by step... thanks

995 2018-09-19 17:46:56 Sadly I think the people who’ll be hurt most from $TLRY are average people just now jumping on a euphoric bandwagon. Once I see people who don’t normally trade stocks talking about something they wouldn’t normally touch, it makes me think the top is near.

1013 2018-09-19 17:42:14 Ugh. Low stocks, prices and shipment time, I can relate to the frustration.

While it's real nice to get the things I want, I don't like the experiences I've had with issues like these that make complications on orders I'm excited about.
1014 2018-09-19 17:42:05 Lowest are the Kingfisher stocks

1021 2018-09-19 17:40:53 Yo siempre q he entrado al día siguiente a tirado para abajo. Las 2 veces q he entrado siempre e entrado en MH. 
1022 2018-09-19 17:40:22 At midday, MBS lower, but off worst levels of the day. Stocks mixed. 10-yr yield 3.06%.
1023 2018-09-19 17:39:58 Usually won’t do this, but if you have extra money laying around , 500+, go download fidelity, and look into cannabis companies to buy stocks in. The time is now, the choice is yours.
1024 2018-09-19 17:39:22 cannabis stocks jumping today, boiiiiiii 
1025 2018-09-19 17:39:19 The choppiness and volatility today is crazy - Stocks are all over the place. It will be lack of volume so very few Buyers and Sellers around so Prices have to move a lot to attract Buyers low and encourage Sellers High.
1026 2018-09-19 17:38:55 Oh it’s a weed company based in Canada. Just watching cannabis stocks, our folks have been imprisoned for cannabis too long, investing via the market is a safe way for us to make money on white owned companies.
1027 2018-09-19 17:38:40 When everyone comes down off this musical chairs high in the pot stocks, make sure you have a clear exit plan.  There are "rumors of $KO looking at an acquisition in the industry" being used to help pump these stocks.  Be VERY careful.
1028 2018-09-19 17:38:39 Some of it probably is $tlry, and bad week for short positions...other scam stocks like $riot rising with meltup even.

1034 2018-09-19 17:37:04 I’ll have a go. Market cap is irrelevant in crypto. We’re dealing in currencies, not stocks. There are numerous articles explaining this but some people just don’t  want to learn. Market cap talk is for noobs. For the record, $589 is utter nonsense.
1035 2018-09-19 17:36:40 I expect to see old garbage stocks like $TSLA to sell off for new garbage stocks like $TLRY

1038 2018-09-19 17:35:53 TCS, INFY Still Alive. And Don't Forget HDFC's Near 50 Week SMA. Even If They PullBack 5%, That Would Help Nifty Along With These Stocks.
1039 2018-09-19 17:35:50 Yes so many things he said and doesn't do but tweets about, like lower unemployment, raise our GDP, cut taxes, getting our stocks up,  negotiating with North Korea to denuclearize.  Ugh how annoying.

1043 2018-09-19 17:33:55 how much of the move is just buy ins caused by the squeeze ? $14B market cap on 10M$ Quarterly sales ? retail momentum stocks can overshoot dramatically it shorting becomes impossible . yo a less degree this is what will happen if TSLA ever breaks

Then again, idk if that bloc of investors is big enuf to really move stocks ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

1066 2018-09-19 17:24:36 JPM BAC C --- the NEW cannabis stocks!
1067 2018-09-19 17:24:21 I agree, that's legit. I was more talking about being cautious about the pretenders, because it doesn't take much to say you are "involved" in the marijuana industry. It's a cycle that has been repeated over and over throughout history, dating back to railroad & radio stocks.

1088 2018-09-19 17:17:31 I can see why you would say that. Doesn't mean whatever stock is in danger. Some people just like to share their thoughts/news/ideas on stocks they are invested in and talk about what they are analyzing.
1089 2018-09-19 17:17:16 Upward rally in the mentioned stocks??

1091 2018-09-19 17:16:49 People who take a minus offer on #TheChase should be put in the stocks and have stinkbombs thrown at them.

1094 2018-09-19 17:16:06 RIP guys. You can't short on poor fundamentals as other high priced stocks never follow that either for a while. Can only short if there's a clear top. Your loss

1107 2018-09-19 17:11:56 The U.S. economy added 201,000 jobs in August, more than expected. Wages also jumped. Is this bullish for stocks? 

For answers, let's look at 3 examples from the stock market's recent history.
1108 2018-09-19 17:11:33 So i've been investing in stocks for about a year and a half now... lets just say im not bad at it

1110 2018-09-19 17:09:01 Worse.  84% of stocks in America are own by the top 10% of the wealthiest (beneficiaries). Once the high inflation rates are added into real wage gains, Americans make less than they did 2 years ago. For unemployment rate2.1mil jobs annually added since 2011
1111 2018-09-19 17:08:31 The stock market is not a true indicator of the economy, in part because the average American doesn’t own stocks.

1117 2018-09-19 17:05:54 if only you can hold. also if one's basket is ONLY cloud, then better hold say 100 or 200 only each stock. as these stocks swing big both ways and losses can be big too on paper.
1118 2018-09-19 17:05:35 Really.  THAT is why the market is selling the Riskiest stocks?  (apart from the Pot-mania)  
It isn't that simple.
1119 2018-09-19 17:05:17 I want y’all to be careful of these cannabis stocks, be mindful that six months away BITCOIN was all the rage. Going for as much as $20,000 a coin; now look at that valuation. Don’t get emotional when investing, DONT CHASE HYPE!!!!
1120 2018-09-19 17:04:31 If pot stocks stay hot into the close. I may have to load up $cron , possible move to $20 in coming days?  I’ll wait til the close like usual.

RT @EddyElfenbein
48% of Americans think the stock market has been flat for the last 10 years, and 19% think it has declined. The S&P and the Dow are both up over 120% from July 31, 2008 to July 31, 2018, and the Nasdaq is +230%.
1123 2018-09-19 17:03:56 keeping an eye on the 10 year yield going past 3%. It’s a good sign if stocks keep gaining at these levels

1148 2018-09-19 16:55:59 There is a major shift to #Cannabis Stocks. They are behaving like what $Crypto did back in December.
1149 2018-09-19 16:55:57 Red flags for me are if they’re from the US, and/or they describe themselves as entrepreneurs in tech, crypto currency, or stocks/finance.

Will also delete if they’re a creepy looking (usually middle aged) white dude.

1151 2018-09-19 16:55:15 As you like twitter so much why do you redirect people. Why not post your answers here. Is it you are working on more fiction?
1152 2018-09-19 16:55:07 The big money in stocks are not made by following people on twitter. I love all my core positions. I don't care if anyone buys. I am just excited to see them executing. Do your own homework. The knowledge you gain from the process is worth more than any gain or loss in a stock.

1178 2018-09-19 16:49:12 Since your goal is to make money over a longer period of time, you can compound, or reinvest, your profits to purchase additional stocks, therefore expanding your portfolio.
1179 2018-09-19 16:49:12 Someone needs to connect the dots... so we can buy common stocks like these with BTC
1180 2018-09-19 16:48:18 When you wake up and see one of your stocks took a nosedive in the market, you may let your emotions tempt you to sell the stock immediately. If this stock recovers, you will lose money by selling it at a low point.
1181 2018-09-19 16:48:05 What do you see? The Russell 1000 Growth index $RLG has only outperformed the Russell 1000 Value Index $RLV to this degree ONCE in all of market history (data back to 1978).

1189 2018-09-19 16:46:41 Cannabis companies in the U.S. aren’t even bankable by financial institutions because federal law prevent it. If you looking for large profits financial services stocks and young cannabis American companies are the long play

1217 2018-09-19 16:38:32 the last month has really not been good for bonds. Bonds have broken through resistance and are moving worse  Stocks have been on a rally and bonds overseas have moved higher in yield. Both are pushing US bonds and MBS worse to compete for investor attention.

1221 2018-09-19 16:36:44 Could you please provide the trading timeframe for the above stocks? I want to backtest them, thanks.
1222 2018-09-19 16:36:43 Stocks would fall by many % on such news. BTC resiliency is puzzling. Any idea why?
1223 2018-09-19 16:35:55 Tomorrow some of the UK listed stocks are paying dividends I'm looking at three for a intraday trade,Crest Nicholson which is paying £33.00,Dignity plc paying £24,and Redrow paying £28.
1224 2018-09-19 16:35:43 Weed stocks going parabolic, lol. The world has too much free capital desperate for returns.
1225 2018-09-19 16:35:38 Wait till stocks plummet in 2 years or so. Joe will kill himself for jumping in stocks.

1229 2018-09-19 16:34:28 Why is it that when trump tweets about a corporation such as "Boeing" the stocks go down, but when Elon Musk tweets about going private the FCC and DOJ get involved? Whats the difference?
1230 2018-09-19 16:34:25 what do you think will be a possible buy scenario? I'm trading tech stocks for short term and I'm learning about AD lines as well as breadth analisys, my understanding is that a lower AD line means more declinign stocks, but which ones are the signals for a possible leg up?
1231 2018-09-19 16:34:24 This shit is crazy watching marijuana stocks trading at these INSANE VALUATIONS
1232 2018-09-19 16:34:18 Same man, I stared at weed stocks all year. bought Cron and aurora but when I watched tilray closely it went from 22-35 quickly and I thought I missed the bump. Boy was I wrong lmao. I could have paid off my student loans with one stock

1234 2018-09-19 16:34:02 @LucidInvestment  Tyler, curious if your hyperwave picked up all these pot stocks?  And what phase we in?
1235 2018-09-19 16:32:48 Oh yeah, gold miners are rallying too. So, the new strategy should be to sell tech and buy: gold, weapons, and pot stocks! #stocks
1236 2018-09-19 16:32:39 No loan or finance is required for civil construction. They're self-funding the civil construction work. And for this extension rolling stocks can be managed for few years for which bidding is ongoing.
1237 2018-09-19 16:32:03 Sir..what is the method to select such stocks.
1238 2018-09-19 16:31:25 Stocks is moving in different directions today

1243 2018-09-19 16:29:41 I never really paid attention to higher priced stocks until I started trading $TLRY with smaller sizing. Then I realized what you have been saying all along in regards to large moves with higher priced stocks. Your strategy makes more sense now.

1257 2018-09-19 16:25:43 They have pulled all the bids on the really hot stocks on this day to avoid having them run away so take a small chance and you might get a big bargain !

1260 2018-09-19 16:25:13 It’s one stock I wish I owned. I own several other Pot stocks that have done well and a couple that’s done extremely well. Waiting for a big pull back to jump in Tilray.
1261 2018-09-19 16:25:08 Just a bit of reality check to those who want to buy an Official Carat Bong, days before the concert, which has limited stocks, brand new with a budget of Php 2k?????? Too good to be true.

1266 2018-09-19 16:24:24 Yup, that was the common knowledge narrative that provided us the energy for the move we got.  Now I look fwd to the “get out of bonds, buy stocks” phase.
1267 2018-09-19 16:24:08 Todo movimiento parabólico termina igual, en esas Pot stocks es donde está ahora la euforia...  lo jodido es determinar CUANDO se acaba (eso si, el negocio tiene mucho futuro y aquí debería tomarse con seriedad ese negocio, que no sean solo extranjeros)
1268 2018-09-19 16:23:37 Someone hasn’t taken a risk management course!!!!!
1269 2018-09-19 16:23:22 The bullishness surrounding Tilray lifted the other pure-play marijuana stocks, with Canopy Growth adding nearly 7% on Tuesday and Cronos Group surging more than 13%. Both companies were also rallying again on Wednesday morning.
1270 2018-09-19 16:23:18 You can get the robinhood or stash app on your phone...simply google marijuana stocks and see what you're interesting in, then begin to buy them once they verify your bank account
1271 2018-09-19 16:22:38 January. Us did. Looks like the algos are now bullish dax with higher euro. But euro in downtrend to so they might be buying Dollar assets(us stocks) when euro goes up?
1272 2018-09-19 16:22:27 unfortunately it looks like no one is "winning" apart from those owning stocks and shares which are in dollars.  watch the pound being equal or less than the pound in the coming months and interest rates rising.  Time for #indyref2

1281 2018-09-19 16:19:34 Valuation? A few years ago the industry experts claimed Amazon $AMZN was over valued at $300.  Today it trades at nearly $2000 and P/E ratio is still egregious. I’ll keep buying pot stocks and you can keep talking valuation.

1297 2018-09-19 16:14:14 Life has gotten more nuanced since 1984 in some ways. Data, which was scarce then, is abundant and largely free now. There are hugely more stocks available to investors now including almost the entire foreign world of materiality. (1/5)

1303 2018-09-19 16:13:21 It was but weed stocks sell weed that ppl actually use. They don’t need a token and weed growing is open source. No one is in control of all the seeds

1311 2018-09-19 16:10:58 Yes, in ncav investing, the screener results just tell you which stocks to research further.

Over time I’ve realised that the most important aspect of ncav investing is due dilligence/risk assessment (especially if you’re concentrated). The valuation part is relatively easy.

1318 2018-09-19 16:09:58 The economy is doing well in terms of stocks and the unemployment rate, but we still have big problems with many people not having the money to afford essentials like health care. Just read about a guy who died because he couldn’t afford insulin.

1338 2018-09-19 16:03:51 And on that same note - Money coming out of yen also into stocks. So it’s general rotation out of safety of bonds and yen and into risk assets stocks and commodities. That’s how I see it
1339 2018-09-19 16:03:42 Investing in stocks
1340 2018-09-19 16:03:03 $baba very good chart here. weekly chart now seen two bottom stick green candle on support of cloud bottom AND this week higher low. may see 50% chance bottoming here BUT monthly now @ mid BB so need Oct to consolidate. NO reason to play China stocks now until clear signal.
1341 2018-09-19 16:02:57 Still? I haven’t been recommending EM stocks to outperform in years. Will they ever catch up with U.S. markets? Of course! All major categories have long years in the sun, similar periods in the rain, (1/2)
1342 2018-09-19 16:02:36 They will never see the real GAINS....  everyone wants to make money so fast.... check out the #cannabis stocks .... they've all moved ;)

1344 2018-09-19 16:02:09 Se ha cortado la cadena de pagos. No necesito reconvertir nada porque mi empresa tiene un amplisimo mercado.  El problema es que todas las empresas se encuentran con sus stocks completos por falta de consumo. Vos sabés que la gente no está consumiendo? Conocés la realidad?
1345 2018-09-19 16:01:29 I have seen penny stocks with better income statements.  This thing almost certainly crash hard.
1346 2018-09-19 16:01:03 The whole premise behind this is not just speculation, though -even though it’s overvalued like shit.. (of course I’ll never take a loan to invest in stocks). The medical benefits plus Coca-Cola wanting to invest in CBD, plus the imminent legalization make it an industry to own.
1347 2018-09-19 16:00:14 Millennial money: Bitcoin ==> Pot stocks ==> food stocks?

1355 2018-09-19 15:58:39 How does one short cannabis stocks?
1356 2018-09-19 15:58:38 The dichotomy persists between undervalued Canadian listed #Cannabis stocks like $MPXEF and $CRON $TLRY. $MPXEF growing just as fast is with just as much sales, but 1 20th the market cap. US Tutes can't buy Canadian listed #PotStocks
1357 2018-09-19 15:58:23 $TLRY shorts #UpInSmoke #Trading #Stocks #StocksToTrade #StocksNotToShort
1358 2018-09-19 15:57:09 USA bond yields today suddenly rising up to @4%....Big crash in USA bank stocks today....
1359 2018-09-19 15:57:05 Fundamentals seem pretty fine here IMO, valuation just got ahead of itself and Q was messy with one time expenses. Stocks at 30x forward multiples can’t miss or this is what happens
1360 2018-09-19 15:57:04 ellos tienen stocks y negocios o llc dentro de su propia compañia ellos van desde deportes, ent, tecnologia, modelaje like a shitload of things que no creo que esa lista los ponga a temblar como the news y fans intl lo hacen ver
1361 2018-09-19 15:56:20 Want to create wealth in mkt. Avoid these groups/stocks for life -
1) ADAG
2) Adani
3) SREI
4) JP 
5) likes of Dish TV, HCC, Jain Irr
6) Politically affiliated shareholders say DLF, Suntv etc

Capital saved equals to wealth created.
1362 2018-09-19 15:56:06 how can i invest in cannabis stocks?
1363 2018-09-19 15:55:58 Eso es bien relativo y tbh no creo que a sm le afecte, (this me again talking as a pr not a fan) ellos tienen stocks en todo y tienen muchas mini ent companies una lista en la cual fue hecha biased hasta cierto punto no creo que les afecte a ellos mucho like ellos
1364 2018-09-19 15:55:56 Really really hope you all are getting in these stocks and taking part in "Reefer Madness" I want you all to succeed damn it!!!! 
1365 2018-09-19 15:55:39 When I was 17 my parent found out I smoked pot and made me flush my stash down the toilet. Fast forward 20 years and I’ve spent most of the last week helping them buy marijuana stocks and CBD oil for my dad’s hip. Next week I’m going to teach them how to take bong rips.
1366 2018-09-19 15:55:21 See the point, but bit of a stocks v. flows thing, no?
1367 2018-09-19 15:55:14 Land is more fun to own that stocks #RevelationProperties #Land #RevPro #Ownit #Fun
1368 2018-09-19 15:55:11 Weed stocks are Crypto 2017 - form CNBC point of view it make sense...They write what people want they arent "financial" advisors. It is too late... sory :)
1369 2018-09-19 15:55:10 Welp, stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau. Woohoo! $spy $qqq $dja
1370 2018-09-19 15:54:35 Adding to this. PPFAS mutual fund invests partially in international stocks.
1371 2018-09-19 15:54:31 $HIPH pot stocks are going crazy today. Watching for this .05 break and it might be a huge run to .15 if not more. Farm bill about to pass!!
1372 2018-09-19 15:53:34 If you are not playing this $TLRY action one  way or another then you don’t know how to play volatile stocks...

Have your stops and exits set and play...
1373 2018-09-19 15:52:36 Hi @ErrolSlater1, I'm a reporter working on a story about auto stocks. I see that your company @ejsi_ltd recently tweeted about Ford's stocks. Do you have a few mins to chat?

1376 2018-09-19 15:52:14 Clearly the next recession won't be good for stocks reliant on corporate stock buybacks for support.
1377 2018-09-19 15:52:14 Apparently Weed stocks are the new crypto and I guarantee the same idiots will lose the same amount of money. The best part of owning Apple stock, for example, is that the dumbest people I know can't grow an Apple watch in their closet.
1378 2018-09-19 15:52:13 once i figure out how stocks work, it’s over for u hoes
1379 2018-09-19 15:51:42 The #HackittReview requires that there are responsible asset owners, who will have to collect, maintain and interrogate structured data, says Terry Stocks #AllianceRoadshow
1380 2018-09-19 15:51:37 Expect $TLRY to announce a massive secondary offering soon. Has anyone thought about what the Canadian cultivators MJ stocks will do when Cannabis is fully legal in the states & the US cultivators can export? It’s not today, but it will happen.
1381 2018-09-19 15:51:36 Retail investors don't move stocks 
1382 2018-09-19 15:51:17 also on a win bonus maybe
1383 2018-09-19 15:50:42 Seems like number of stocks discussed on my feed is becoming smaller? TLRY is everywhere today.  Feels like lesser quality names are taking up more space in traders universe lately.

1386 2018-09-19 15:49:55 I don't play many penny stocks but I'm in $CVRS. Purely technical. I like the chart on the daily.

1388 2018-09-19 15:49:41 tlry effect? OMG...those weed stocks are certainly "high" into the clouds
1389 2018-09-19 15:49:40 Thanks for the info. We’re making a killing on the weed stocks this morning.
1390 2018-09-19 15:49:37 Stocks don't trade on current conditions, they trade on changes in expectations

1392 2018-09-19 15:49:17 NYH supply has to fall given stocks and going into winter spec - drop in imports / less upline combo likely drives it down.
1393 2018-09-19 15:49:12 The run in $GWPH just started IMHO... with this much hype in Pot stocks wont be surprised to see this above $200 soon $tlry $cgc $cron $abcff
1394 2018-09-19 15:49:12 First, that article includes estimates from JP Morgan (okay that's fine) but ignores other investments such as physical assets or property. We buy stocks because the underlying companies are profitable. If things are driven by speculation vs. profitability, then it's like bitcoin
1395 2018-09-19 15:49:08 If you can afford stocks read a book and buy stock.
1396 2018-09-19 15:49:07 They are pumping so much money into these marijuana stocks
1397 2018-09-19 15:48:48 I know the best stocks. I love to invest!
1398 2018-09-19 15:48:34 Got to be long biased on these pot stocks till they prove the upside is done JMO
1399 2018-09-19 15:48:30 36 year old blue chip stocks are more valuable than at issue, 36 years of "service" to the county is more valuable than I year, antiques are more valuable after 36 years, 36 year marriages are considered valuable but 36 years of emotional pain from attempted rape is of no value.
1400 2018-09-19 15:48:17 Tabhi mein sochoon.. Why the sell off today.

I feel like singing to my stocks and investment... "pardesi pardesi jaana nahin... Mujhe chodke... Mujhe chodke.."
Pardesi mere yaara... Vaada nibhana..
Mujhe returns dena, kabhi bhul na jaana..
1401 2018-09-19 15:47:56 In this market, just holding is not good. Take profits, add on dip is better. Unless pot stocks.....LoL
1402 2018-09-19 15:47:52 Terry Stocks has just put up a slide that says ‘Data and Digital IS the Golden Thread’  #AllianceRoadshow
1403 2018-09-19 15:47:23 Marijuana stocks are the new crypto
1404 2018-09-19 15:46:51 HOLY POT STOCKS!!!!
$NBEV $TLRY $NEPT $ZYNE $CRON $MJ
1405 2018-09-19 15:46:50 Financial stocks in broad rally, with J.P. Morgan leading the Dow's gainers
1406 2018-09-19 15:46:35 Jobs, income, and stocks all at record levels under GOP leadership. @TheDemocrats only make promises while Trump has delivered results
1407 2018-09-19 15:46:28 Well this person has all the original gear still working and in vehicle and he’s definitely not a cop he stocks shelves at the grocery store
1408 2018-09-19 15:46:18 weeds stocks. First trades were 2012. This sector trades like no other. This particular stomp reminds me of early 2014 but this time, there are sales and earnings, but much more supply.
1409 2018-09-19 15:46:03 The pot stocks are putting the FUN back into fundamentals, at least
1410 2018-09-19 15:45:36 All stocks failed ER always have reversal Time a week following that pay attention. Then gone
1411 2018-09-19 15:45:34 In other news, user intentionally opens iOS stocks app
1412 2018-09-19 15:45:29 Then congratulate him. Is there another purpose to trading stocks then to make money? It's humorous to add a Hormel factory worker, but he can do the same thing the 18 year old did, no?
1413 2018-09-19 15:45:25 These weed stocks going to buy my first house  $CGC $TLRY $APHQF $ACBFF $CNTTF $CRON $MJ
1414 2018-09-19 15:45:03 Yep -  this also illustrates how dangerous it can be to short volatility in individual stocks.
1415 2018-09-19 15:44:37 Idk what’s going on but the marijuana stocks are surging right now
1416 2018-09-19 15:44:03 Citron just another sad dude behind a computer screen trying to manipulate stocks LOL
1417 2018-09-19 15:44:00 Instead of investing US stocks via hedge fund managers and having to report that income, the GOP (and probably a few Dems) invested in digital currency via offshore shell corporations. We know McConnell has a few, so do the rest?
1418 2018-09-19 15:43:41 Sold 30 shares of #cronos this morning@ $17.10 a share, they're now @ $18.50 a share as of 11:30 am. There's never a "right" time when it comes to buying or selling stocks
1419 2018-09-19 15:43:31 $TRIN of 0.39 seems rather extreme. Wondering if that will rebound today (which usually would accompany a drop in stocks).  If not, yet another all-time high?
1420 2018-09-19 15:43:29 Bout to post a couple of intra-day stocks, if you want to see.
1421 2018-09-19 15:42:59 There are more  trade setups in forex + futures than I've seen in months. Wouldn't risk my $$ on knife catching cannabis right now, but that's just me. 

I'm sure some ppl will make bank day trading these stocks
1422 2018-09-19 15:42:01 What's wrong with this? If your home's value goes up by 4% every year, then what's wrong with spending the equity? If you invest in stocks that go up 4% every year there's no problem with spending your profits.
1423 2018-09-19 15:42:00 Are you just talking property or also businesses, stocks?
1424 2018-09-19 15:41:58 Jeez! we only just legalised weed yesterday and the Yankees are trading pot stocks.
1425 2018-09-19 15:41:56 Among the NIFTY stocks , only 5 stocks haave seen long built up today.

They are 

1.ICICI BANK
2.VEDANTA
3.GAIL
4.TATA STEEL
5.HINDALCO

1429 2018-09-19 15:40:50 Wed AM: corn +0.25Z, beans +7.5X, meal +4.50Z, wheat +7.5Z-SRW. Hogs -0.875Z, cattle +0.5Z. Crude oil +0.96 on lower stocks. Dollar is steady. Dow stocks rally 200 on rates helping banks. Catepillar. Grain futures see less pressure.

1434 2018-09-19 15:40:17 One group of stocks just hit all-time highs, and traders see more gains to come ...
1435 2018-09-19 15:40:01 Such news provide very good opportunity  for traders .

Wait for half an hour and then take a position where the stock is heading and make lots of money in that .
1436 2018-09-19 15:39:24 Traded in my grandson’s $AAPL because of trade crap for some nice #pot stocks $CANN and $ICNAF and some robotic surgery stock $ESCO
1437 2018-09-19 15:39:24 Right!  Where did we hear that before?  Get real. You haven’t successfully negotiated a single deal yet. No deal with Canada, Mexico, DACA, immigration, bump stocks, infrastructure, NOTHING!
1438 2018-09-19 15:39:01 @GarethSoloway when these pot stocks crash, can they be halted?
1439 2018-09-19 15:38:47 Notice how the index always go up. just when the #FANG stocks get hit, some how these guys find another group to prop up the market. It's a science , don't try to duplicate this at home. These are trained professionals.

1448 2018-09-19 15:35:24 $TLRY honestly far too much risk being a long up here, your an adrelin junkie if you think this is a good idea, sure it could go to $300 ++ but there is risk of a SEC halt as shorts will be calling im sure, best to look for lower priced stocks yet to run

1456 2018-09-19 15:32:53 A buddy of mine owns a ton of pot stocks - hes a builder and a broker advised hi to buy them a year ago he was down huge and same broker told him to dump them a few weeks back he told him to F off - now hes a happy camper

1460 2018-09-19 15:31:33 Right they are trading moments and they are there everyday - I was responded to investing per se - there are opportunties in energy almost everyday - look at #natgas this past week or the OPEX on WTI why worry want the herd is doing at inflated levels to punt on stocks?
1461 2018-09-19 15:30:40 Not ALL pt stocks are the same. $GWPH GW Pharna a bio tech who ALREADY has @US_FDA approval for their WELL tested CBD treatment for epilepsy should be going up like Tilray.

1464 2018-09-19 15:29:46 @Notre_Shop Really love to patronize your shop online, but y'all need to do something about bots (i.e., mail order request for limited items) - they are eating up all the stocks available
1465 2018-09-19 15:29:20 American families (in certain localities that are largely Republican) are seeing increased take home pay of cents, while inflation goes up meaning less real wages. All while seeing a reduction of social services due to federal deficits.

 So corporations can buy back stocks.

1496 2018-09-19 15:23:37 $TLRY -- a great reminder why you shouldn't short momentum stocks. Ask anyone with grey hair about shorting Internet stocks. Despite being right, most sellers went bust because 1. unlimited risk 2. market-timing is a casino game.

1498 2018-09-19 15:23:18 I like to invest in 5 cent penny stocks with an unregistered investment company and promote myself like I am a genius while never showing returns.

1534 2018-09-19 15:14:39 Commercials don't focus on the ST. They are positioning for a stock market crash and a #Fed reversal of policy to QE which is why I'm buying TLT on the way down here because yields will fall below 2% on the 10Y imho, far higher gains than on the move up. WTI to crash with stocks.

1609 2018-09-19 14:54:32 o u on stocks now huh man
1610 2018-09-19 14:54:27 Besides cannabis stocks i think gaming stocks are the next big thing.
1611 2018-09-19 14:54:26 Dear sir, 
I want to buy 10000 stocks of dena bank is it right time to buy or not??? Please help
1612 2018-09-19 14:54:14 Ones I’m researching: REITs, dividend stocks, masternodes, selling handmade children’s clothing, real estate , self storage facility

Some of these aren’t big income but It would be nice to have any extra 

Open to suggestions!!!
1613 2018-09-19 14:54:14 #NF made Lower-High Lower-Low for a 3rd consecutive session even as global stocks advanced for a second day in a row and rupee recovered against the US dollar.
1614 2018-09-19 14:54:00 You saying that $YTEN has some connection to these pot stocks?
1615 2018-09-19 14:53:58 @jimcramer No clue if you answer your tweets.  If so why do you think the cannabis stocks are going to drop like a rock after October 17th? I now what the date is about but why the drop?
1616 2018-09-19 14:53:26 $CRON was a nice one, but these pot stocks are so crowded that i'm avoiding them. Next one in another day you take it, these setups happen quite frequently and you know how to explore them!
1617 2018-09-19 14:53:22 Be careful out there with $TLRY (Tilray) Stock, is currently a low float stock (only 10 million shares available) and 1/3 of those shares are owned by short sellers. 

When the bubble pops (and it will) the downfall will be spectacular!

1619 2018-09-19 14:52:29 Don’t be fooled by the Dow’s biggish move today. Dow is price weighted and pops in 3 stocks account for much of the nearly 180 point rise. Boeing. Caterpillar. Goldman Sachs. The S&P 500 is flat. Nasdaq is down a bit.

1624 2018-09-19 14:51:33 It's either a bubble or the first inning of a generational change in how stocks are valued. A reasonable, and sustainable capital shift towards higher returns with risks that aren't as great as they seem.

Depends on how my portfolio does.
1625 2018-09-19 14:51:31 Recovery happened in 2009.... you’re economy is as fake as you are....Companies are just using that tax breaks to artificially blow up there stocks.... if you want us to believe there’s real change how about our wages?

1665 2018-09-19 14:41:43 From 2012 until 2017 I was seeing growth in stocks and 401k’s. Since the beginning of 2018 everything has been flat. An economy is like a large container ship. It’s takes a long time for course corrections, good or bad! The economic ship is heading towards a reef this year.
1666 2018-09-19 14:41:19 This reminds me of when that guy in Ripple became the 5th richest person in the world. Got to love the rational markets.

It would be down by 1 MMT from the August estimate, and well below the 2017/18 carryout of 2.391 MMT.
1668 2018-09-19 14:40:56 If you're looking to take a directional position in the pot stocks with options, there's better alternatives in $MJ at the moment. The IV rank in $TLRY makes no sense right now.

1730 2018-09-19 14:29:39 CNBC just suggested pot stocks are like bitcoin stocks.  WRONG. Pot has been around forever...the demand and supply has been aroiund forever..and some of the corporations are making real money.
1731 2018-09-19 14:29:23 If you want to trigger your financial advisor, ask them why they didn't buy you pot stocks.
1732 2018-09-19 14:29:03 Lots of people talking about how the rout in emerging markets will hurt U.S. stocks. But think about it....

Emerging markets get crushed, U.S. stocks go up. But once emerging markets rally (nothing goes down forever), what will U.S. stocks do?

1735 2018-09-19 14:28:22 I don't follow a lot of them, and don't care...there have been 100's of easy shorts since 2009 if you know how to spot trends (Rental Cars, Retail, Commodity, etc.) - they do not understand growth stocks and have no clue what they are doing

1738 2018-09-19 14:27:41 Para que el gráfico quede más elegante quizás en vez de que todo sea spot hay que ir empalmando con cotizaciones new-crop esos últimos meses. Más que todo para no comerte la estacionalidad en los años de stocks ajustados (que bueno, lamentablemente en EEUU hace rato no tienen).

1744 2018-09-19 14:26:07 So let me understand this, please explain:

There are articles out there that US border might turn you back or ban entry if you are in #Marijuana business or stocks. 

Yet, Coca-Cola (big US company) can be looking at getting into distribution.
1745 2018-09-19 14:25:37 Because the number of reservations exceeded stocks,if there's a person who doesn't buy slogan reserved 9/23,first come first served can buy.
1746 2018-09-19 14:25:33 If there are 10,000 people looking at the stocks and trying to pick winners, 1 in 10,000 is going to score, by chance alone. It's basically a chance operation. Smart investors seek academic financial advice first.

1751 2018-09-19 14:24:18 The Dow is hitting new highs, but the environment for trading individual stocks sort of sucks.  At least, the type of names I traffic in. I'm playing it tight to the vest right now, not letting the indexes pressure me into low prob laggard stocks. #patience
1752 2018-09-19 14:24:16 Good for you for trading it man.  Takes stones.  Stories like these in a sector have me running the other way. Sentiment maxed out. I'm sure the bubble will blow bigger.  

And for anyone watching, Tony has been in on the pot stocks a long time.  He's not just here for the encore

1754 2018-09-19 14:23:55 Dear Hassan. Hapimag business model is outdated with very little flexibility for its customers. This is the reason why you have a hard time attracting a younger customer base. I inherited stocks from my parents, along came a contract binding me to pay an substantial annual fee

1759 2018-09-19 14:21:22 I can name about a dozen software stocks that have doubled in last 3-4 months. Medical device stocks staa, tndm. Internet names grub, etsy, mtch, angi. All up 80, 100%. Pot stocks just icing on the cake.
1760 2018-09-19 14:21:12 If there are 10,000 people looking at the stocks and trying to pick winners, 1 in 10,000 is going to score, by chance alone. It's basically a chance operation. Smart investors seek academic financial advice first.
1761 2018-09-19 14:21:07 Reading a bit about it it seems like a somewhat promising blend. Most American craft whiskies are starting a new so the whiskey is too young to be anything worth consuming. It sounds like he’s picking from good stocks, if he has a talented blender it could be decent.

1766 2018-09-19 14:19:27 We bought another gold miner in Supercycle Investor yesterday, and it's up a respectable 2% or so today. Meanwhile, our pot stocks are going VROOOOOOOOOM! Sigh. I'm waiting for the "Why don't we own MOAR pot stocks" letters to come in.

1768 2018-09-19 14:19:03 I have absolutely no clue and not really following those dope stocks nor that index. a friend just mentioned it today and it was (again) +50% pre open. couldn't find your index, so I googled, found diff index, but ain't parabolic. just saying. AMZN is. and BTC was.
1769 2018-09-19 14:19:03 Hate to tell you that using the stock market as an index of a booming economy is like using the temp inside of your home to say that the weather is fine. And how many people that get paid by the hour own stocks?  This is a bullet point that only applies to those who have.
1770 2018-09-19 14:18:40 Bought more #AMD on the dip. Like I said when it was $17, this #stock has got wings. CEO is managing the hell out of it and #INTC & #NVDA losing market shares.

1774 2018-09-19 14:18:21 I cannot even buy/sell stocks premarket. I place a trade, it stays open until next day and fills only on market open.
Another major total WTF: it’s totally fucked up if I want to place an order for a stock that does IPO today (XYF). Totally doesn’t work. Can you fix it?!?

1863 2018-09-19 13:57:14 Mark Judge knows this is a farce. Mark rather look over his stocks, Roths, new net check than attend: no crime, charachter assassination by Dems. Looney tunes 36 yrs later crocodile tears. A shill for MeToo and the dishonest desparate. What a sham.

1874 2018-09-19 13:54:58 The melt-up in pot stocks is an important, macro-equity market event. Broad market parabolic moves higher coincide with action just like this. Investors are beginning to like stocks again. 

Watch what happens when they start falling in love with stocks.

1875 2018-09-19 13:53:43 Good point. Perhaps $tsla falls under the same category. Not enough stocks for either theme.
1876 2018-09-19 13:53:39 Agree.  Been investing, swing trading, day trading in weed stocks for years and have not made one dime off $TLRY.  Totally missed the boat.

1878 2018-09-19 13:53:27 @ThomasEWoods @Jason_Stapleton You both need to do shows about the surging pot stocks. Unless Jeff Sessions stop you. LOL
1879 2018-09-19 13:53:25 What puzzles me is why stocks are near an ATH when yields are getting a lot more attractive than dividends...  What am I missing?

1888 2018-09-19 13:51:13 If you were entering into cannabis stocks recently after the beginning of the $TLRY pump, which I think finds a top shortly, you should consider that you are trading laggards as proxy for a leader and when $TLRY falls more than likely others do with it.

1890 2018-09-19 13:50:37 F is one of my favorite stocks in the market right now, not because of its share price performance, but because its current annual dividend sits around 6.4%. This is, of course assuming that the regular dividend payout remains intact.
1891 2018-09-19 13:50:14 I think we have more leverage than we realize. With the amount of old crop stocks still around I wonder how long it would take to use them up.

1897 2018-09-19 13:47:34 Stat of the day. In the TSX composite index there are 245 stocks; of which 3 are weed stocks.

1922 2018-09-19 13:38:40 Thank you for the explanation @FAOfish. I feel the graphic is questionable as it implies we need to fish harder, not smarter, and that maximally fishing all stocks will subsequently help to alliviate hunger. There seems no room for a precautionary and ecosystem-based approach.
1923 2018-09-19 13:38:11 Why so negative on canabis stocks when CNBC is always pushing the Bitcoin scam?

1927 2018-09-19 13:36:30 What’s your take on Indian PSU stocks? Companies like ONGC and NBCC have pristine balance sheets. At least ONGC for sure. But the stock hasn’t moved in years now. Does it have anything to do with the fact that they are Government companies?

1940 2018-09-19 13:33:32 El pbi de 2015 era una ficción basada en quemar stocks (infraestructura, divisas, salud monetaria) para financiar consumo barato y sobreempleo público. Lógicamente vas a estar peor que ahí si estás desarmando eso y armando algo nuevo que se pueda sostener en el tiempo.
1941 2018-09-19 13:33:15 stocks are exploding.
1942 2018-09-19 13:32:40 I try to be patient about these stocks. I really do. These flat lines though are TERRIBLE. At least go down in value so I can buy more for even cheaper, but NOTHING?

1946 2018-09-19 13:31:25 i think stocks go higher. bond proxies get hit, this rotation goes full cycle and traditional momentum names lead again. if you’re looking to be cute, $KRE and 10’s usually pretty strong together. *not a rec*

1948 2018-09-19 13:30:55 Ideally, all stocks should be at a level that we're underfishing under a precautionary approach. I feel the two thumbs up for a category that can easily slip into "overfished" is extremely misleading.
1949 2018-09-19 13:30:51 Today is IMPORTANT. Lots of stocks need to reclaim the key points otherwise they will confirm the bearish pattern esp TEch stocks. Will see. $TSLA $Bidu $AMZN $AAPL $NVDA
1950 2018-09-19 13:30:38 We're so sorry to hear that, Andrew! While you may still be able to track down some stocks in big retailers such as Tesco, we already stopped selling them in the UK last May.
1951 2018-09-19 13:30:09 This is why I never give out stock picks when directly asked. I have my reasons and if you can’t find your own reasons then you don’t need to be picking stocks anyway.
1952 2018-09-19 13:29:48 This man teaching his daughter about investing and stocks on the train this morning IS THE TYPE OF CONTENT I NEED IN MY LIFE
1953 2018-09-19 13:29:26  then stocks going up
1954 2018-09-19 13:28:26 the appetite for extreme risk, such as the cases in crypto and pot stocks, conveys current investor sentiment, and confirms that we are indeed very late in the boom part of the cycle
1955 2018-09-19 13:27:52 Also, stocks have a market cap, whereas “crypto” doesn’t really. U wanna pay $20 billion for $TLRY?!!!
1956 2018-09-19 13:27:42 $RMRK is the one to watch. Cannabis stocks are going absolutely nuts right now.

1968 2018-09-19 13:24:03 I get that, but it seems rather short sighted if the maximum sustainable fishing of one stock at the same time is detrimental for other stocks or ecosystems. I don't see why we lose jobs through underfishing if needed yields are produced.

1973 2018-09-19 13:21:53 Always have half an eye on these pot stocks cause I cleaned up trading them back fall of 2012 through early 2014. They were tradable for about 18 month period and most popular ones had 2-3 big runs each. Once Tilray run is over, wouldn't be surprised to see others push this fall.
1974 2018-09-19 13:21:29 $TLRY is currently trading in the pre-market with a market cap larger than 190 of the S&P 500 stocks, which includes $WYNN and $MGM
1975 2018-09-19 13:21:28 It seems to be the long term bull case for pot stocks would be a substitute for opiod addiction. That doesn't justify the valuation of anything today. Just wondering if that's the answer since pot is not addictive.
1976 2018-09-19 13:21:28 Banks are printing money hand over fist right now. Rates are being so good to them while markets remain in tact. Perfect environment for them. However, their stocks have been laggard. Will they finally pivot today and rip higher? $XLF $GS $MS $BAC $JPM $C

1996 2018-09-19 13:14:36 Stocks will improve performance if they add 420 to their name #coke420
1997 2018-09-19 13:14:07 “The move in Tilray is beyond comprehension. No one needs a market pundit to explain that.  This is just the dynamic of trading low float stocks.  Yes we are short and will hold a manageable position until rationality sets in”
1998 2018-09-19 13:14:03 Agree! Lots of accounts were blown up by shorting $TLRY
$TLRY $232.00  is very #risky for #bulls as well  at this point! methinks
1999 2018-09-19 13:13:51 Are they asking you to weed out which pot stocks to buy?
2000 2018-09-19 13:13:42 apple stocks rise by 30%.
2001 2018-09-19 13:13:40 Anyone who has tried to pick a top in pot stocks last week or so has had their butt handed to them.
2002 2018-09-19 13:12:40 One presumes that this toxic sludge will do wonders for fish stocks along with global micro plastic ingestion.
2003 2018-09-19 13:12:32 Cannabis stocks tho
2004 2018-09-19 13:12:30 Second thing there is now bylaw disclosed by Govt so far. how they are going to deal with issue of being on weed. That will be deal breaker and be enough to bring these stocks at their fair value
2005 2018-09-19 13:12:12 Live Stream Tonight  9:30pm eastern standard time  $AMD $AAPL $SPY  stop chasing the hot stocks tips without a plan.

2011 2018-09-19 13:11:16 so citron doing the first rule in how not to short stocks, shorting on valuation
2012 2018-09-19 13:10:23 For the rich and corporate. Thanks for reminding us. Also corporations are buying back their stocks. Again, thanks for reminding us. Tax breaks end for us, but not corporations. No trickle down. Thanks again.
2013 2018-09-19 13:10:16 It def reminds me of 1998/1999 when Internet related stocks went public with little float and pop from teens to over $100.  Market cap seems like it is extrapolating value MANY, MANY years into the future.  In my spare time, maybe I'll do a DCF this weekend. Ha!
2014 2018-09-19 13:09:59 Day 3: SOLD OUT! 

We weren't even able to take pictures from how busy we were! We're here till' Friday so buy while you can! Stocks run out fast.  We'll be waiting for you at the MAGIS Pavilion, and we'll be roaming around the campus. 

Get Corny! 
2015 2018-09-19 13:07:37 $TLRY is an excellent example why shorting stocks is so risky. No position, just watching the film.
2016 2018-09-19 13:06:59 Redwood mainly plays with other people's money. 

I suspect his own is locked in some defensive stocks somewhere far from here.
2017 2018-09-19 13:06:14 Be pessimistic while picking stocks, but be optimistic about the long-term rewards of investing in stocks.
2018 2018-09-19 13:05:41 Hey Shivanand, we are bringing more and more stocks for our fans. Stay tuned to our next sale on 25th September 2018, 12 PM only on Flipkart. Thanks

2039 2018-09-19 12:58:43 @CitronResearch Isn't backtracking with saying this $TLRY move is a byproduct of low float spotty liquidity stocks, but maybe make that a bit more of an explicit cautionary note in your piece you wrote $150/share ago

2049 2018-09-19 12:57:16 tlry has low public flot which is the reason for the parabolic move up. 
the CEO comments yesterday on CNBC is helping this move up.  There tons of marijuana stocks on the Canadian Exchanges that are much cheaper.

2055 2018-09-19 12:53:46 $NBEV - Despite no company-specific news from the session, shares are trading up over 16 percent. The company on Monday announced trademarks related to cannabinoid-infused drinks and the spike is being viewed as a sympathy move with other marijuana stocks rallying this morning.
2056 2018-09-19 12:52:58 No it wont.  It will maybe reduce CEO wages, stock buy backs and profits for share holders.  I personally know 2 people that can afford to buy stocks.
2057 2018-09-19 12:52:43 "All the money I got from Fathammer Stocks": ha, I don't see any money. 
2058 2018-09-19 12:52:22 I’ve been lucky/cursed enough to have stocks that “hog all the attention”. It feels fun while it lasts but ruins the stock (and often the company) for years. 

I’m happy for $TLRY owners. I’m also delighted no one is talking about retail anymore.
2059 2018-09-19 12:52:20 Hate to say it but $TLRY has nothing on the Internet stocks. I need to see a 4 for 1 split.

2081 2018-09-19 12:44:40 Stocks which stood strong in March selloff , may not have stood strong in July sell off and even Now...in between good stocks made 40%-50% jump from lows. for example : edelweiss March low 230s ..May Top 330s. thats 45%+ return.

so Fix an amount per month. Invest if u like it.

2084 2018-09-19 12:43:56 Incorrect. . Stocks had risen 20%, BUT between March 2009 and Jan 2010 stocks had risen 61%. That’s more than three times faster than Trump’s rise over the same period in his term. Who was president in 2010? Btw stock values are not a good way to measure the economy.

No matter how much it grows, you will never pay tax on it.
2118 2018-09-19 12:27:26 Right to buy was a great thing. Councils wasted the money though and didn't replace stocks. Most of the cash went into council workers gold plated pensions. Still does.
2119 2018-09-19 12:26:41 I know... their downgrades (or upgrades) often lag behind a sudden market reaction. But I found that their rank is not bad for picking mid-term winning stocks... or avoiding loosing stocks. $FB has been ranked as a #4 or #5 for a while now and it's been loosing steam...

2127 2018-09-19 12:23:00 S&P futures vs fair value: -0.80. Nasdaq futures vs fair value: -8.50. Asian and American stocks unexpectedly rallied on Tuesday after the U.S. announced a $200 billion tranche of tariffs on Chinese goods, to which Beijing responded with $60 billion in retaliatory duties.
2128 2018-09-19 12:22:39 Woa woa woa what kind of Christian are you lil fella?  Take a hike on the high road
2129 2018-09-19 12:22:35 Futures minor gains ahead of Wednesday's open.
Dow futures indicate a positive opening. Futures on the S&P 500 were relatively flat, while Nasdaq futures rose signaling a positive opening.  Wow $TLRY.... Looking at marijuana stocks $CGC, $MJ, $CRON this morning.  Happy Trading.

2132 2018-09-19 12:21:50 What tha F is going on with TLRY. I’m one that say stocks moves higher or lower and there nothing we can do about it except use the move in our side but damn this is insane.
2133 2018-09-19 12:21:25 Hi sir, can you please post your view on PHARMA sector and the levels to watch for various stocks on your telegram channel? Thanks.
2134 2018-09-19 12:21:13 hindi po ba limited stocks lang?? like pag umorder po ba ako ng oct. 12 meron pa din ako makukuha?? :")))
2135 2018-09-19 12:21:11 Can't tell you how much I love these weed stocks look at $TLRY in the mid 200's this stock was less that $100 2 weeks ago and $CRON Looking Good premarket. What a beautiful Wednesday @StocksToTrade. I love trading LETS GOOO 
2136 2018-09-19 12:20:51 $TLRY insane! 220's premarket... $CGC $55 #cbd, #cannabis, #marijuana Stocks will run heading into October 17th (Canada becomes Legal). $GRCK $0.027 cheapest CBD play, companies market cap only $60k, microfloat, only 2M outstanding shares.

lesson: Invest in what you understand, spread your risk and know that if something looks too good to be true, it almost certainly is. The products that the banks were churning out in the run-up to the crisis were ever more complex and built on even shakier fundamentals
2138 2018-09-19 12:20:31 Stocks are generally down, so good time to buy. In general, it depends if you have time to play with your stocks. Otherwise, I recommend having a broker or getting into mutual funds.
2139 2018-09-19 12:18:34 @charliebilello can you please update us on the top performaning stocks over the last 10 years? Also please given credit to @CitronResearch research for their call to buy TRLY in the 20’s. You usually rag on people’s call, however, this hit a two grand slams.

2144 2018-09-19 12:16:10 Fuck I shouldn’t have sold my Tilray stock that early....easier said in hindsight though..Congrats to all the longs! $tlry #potstocks #aksjer #stocks
2145 2018-09-19 12:15:29 I see a lot of salt over the $TLRY run up this morning but let’s be clear: You can hate the game, but don’t hate the players. Kudos to the people who made a pile. I wish I had been paying attention to pot stocks after glossing over them in 2016-2017.

2149 2018-09-19 12:13:24 The stock market hits a juncture:

Now that the pension tax deduction expired Friday & buybacks are expected to slow. The market must now find a new catalyst to continue its trend. Not saying it won't, just acknowledging the past tailwinds that have helped move stocks higher YTD.

2152 2018-09-19 12:11:58 Interesting fact about #bloe @BlockEnergyplc they have a vlear edge versus usually aim oil and gas stocks. Their plan is to re complete with side tracks and other methods to open up virgin reservoirs. This is much cheaper than drilling new wells and the upside is huge

2159 2018-09-19 12:09:50 It’s so much information out there and you don’t have to buy 1000s of shares initially.  Just get your feet wet. Potentially better returns than sitting in a bank account with no interest....maybe I’ll share more of my journey but not sure if I want to do it on twitter  #stocks
2160 2018-09-19 12:09:14 I don't believe in $TLRY . Weed stocks are always horseshit.
2161 2018-09-19 12:08:49 Soon as the industry narrows down the amount of crypto exchanges, similar to stocks markets, it will make sense & liquidity won’t be part of FUD. Fear, uncertainty, and disbelief.

2165 2018-09-19 12:05:48 Trump is still in power. 

People forgot about priests who abused 1000's of children.

NRA stocks went up

It's only Tuesday
2166 2018-09-19 12:05:40 Maybe this is what the bank stocks know — systemic corruption is over.
2167 2018-09-19 12:05:19 If you recall, at they said the same about the early stages of internet, especially about Amazon. The cannabis industry can deliver real value to investors AND consumers, whether people like particular stocks is a different story. Look at peers and what Coke said yesterday.

2171 2018-09-19 12:03:35 Sure but these stocks can run longer than you think.  How many people were calling it a pump and dump at 50...75...120... etc etc?  I doubt anyone hitting the offer at this price is saying “putting these bad boys under the mattress for the grand kids”.
2172 2018-09-19 12:03:18 If this isn’t stock manipulation I don’t know what is! Pure speculation and conjecture... but hey thanks I guess I’m buying more stocks this morn as you folks help drive down costs!

2180 2018-09-19 12:00:51 "Pot stocks are going to be an important uncorrelated asset for any institutional investor's portfolio. Just 5-10% exposure to cannabis would've doubled your returns this past month alone."
2181 2018-09-19 12:00:22 @MadMoneyOnCNBC @jimcramer 
The fact you don’t talk about NTNX after it falls 10% about a fake article is proof you have an agenda on a handful of stocks
2182 2018-09-19 12:00:17 Buy off the plan. Stamp duty savings and free Baroque lounge room and bedroom suite package. Stocks are limited. Act now!! 
2183 2018-09-19 12:00:11 Invest in Canadian cannabis stocks!!! I’m up over 100 bucks and I just bought shares last week.  But you gotta do your own research, I’m not gonna tell you which ones are the best buy. #WolfOfWallstreet

2190 2018-09-19 11:57:57 What you need to know today 09/19/18:

~Stock futures point higher as tariffs seen less damaging
~Housing market warms to Buyers
~Trade talks to resume w/ Canada today
~Pot stocks continue to soar and Coca Cola expresses interest in cannabis infused drinks
2191 2018-09-19 11:57:34 Niggas have no idea how the actually cannabis industry works but they are Cannabis stocks experts ha
2192 2018-09-19 11:57:05 Nice event! Time to check some cannabis stocks!
2193 2018-09-19 11:57:00 the pot stocks are sucking the life out of everything else... like is the market even open?... i know $TLRY $CGC $CRON are trading is anything else?...
2194 2018-09-19 11:56:43 Do you randomly pick any stock for writing options? I see all kind of stocks in there especially non FnO active stocks...
2195 2018-09-19 11:56:27 Any and every money manager I heard of, strongly advised to stay away from Cannabis stocks from day one! Even from before thr rumour! 
2196 2018-09-19 11:54:51 Invested in some weed stocks but not Tilray
2197 2018-09-19 11:53:47 He probably gets a cut or at least the time to short selll some stocks.  To say something like that you have to make money off of it,
2198 2018-09-19 11:53:24 Look at every chart-when the crash happened in 2008, everything began to improve. Unemployment slowly came down, stocks rose, home ownership rose after foreclosures and so on. And it’s still going. But according to trump, this started on 11/09/16. Not with a black man.
2199 2018-09-19 11:53:10 Crypto mania has transferred to pot stocks. Expect similar depressing articles about people making very imprudent trades in pot stock names hoping for them to have served as the pathway to get rich at the expense of The Man. Sad.
2200 2018-09-19 11:52:54 "as investment or to buy stocks"

It's about survival
2201 2018-09-19 11:52:54 Such scary territory for the rest of pot stocks to be honest if this thing takes a big hit. Shit

2207 2018-09-19 11:51:45 Pot stocks are the new Crypto stocks lmao. $tilray is going crazy
2208 2018-09-19 11:51:16 Sounds good then nickname the USA Fort Trump. This man is fantastic. Job numbers, unemployment low, stocks up repeatedly, ppl back to work & off food stamps, immigration CUT, tax/wage bonuses, factories opening SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE HAG who sits and screams the sky is falling.
2209 2018-09-19 11:51:08 Indeed. Even the ones we think as 'quality' stocks and build concentrated positions on them can see pretty serious declines from time to time - Avanti, Lupin, Symphony for cases in point. Have to be prepared.
2210 2018-09-19 11:49:43 The staff canteen at work stocks Pepsi Max Ginger, but not classic Pepsi Max.

If you give all the Tax breaks to the wealthiest 1% of the population they buy back their stocks or hide the money in offshore accounts.

2245 2018-09-19 11:24:38 Options Terms
Implied volatility shows how much movement the market expects in future. Options with high implied volatility suggest investors in the stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could mean an event may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off.

2248 2018-09-19 11:23:26 Yes, several stocks. The dot com craze was just as crazy as $TLRY is now. There were just several stocks doing this, instead of one.
2249 2018-09-19 11:23:15 I already have HDFC AMC stocks from IPO. So I bought Reliance Asset Management stocks today.
2250 2018-09-19 11:22:45 $TLRY been avoiding b/c it’s not my thing to daytrade stocks that move like this - why? Because you could see a 40 point DROP in minutes. /4
2251 2018-09-19 11:21:41 And American Consumers will pay more for everything, on top of high gas prices and Health care. The real winners are Corporations and share holders.

2798 2018-09-19 03:58:38 Longer the holding period=Higher the probability of good returns.

Lower the price=Higher the probability of good returns.

So, Buy low & hold for longer period.

Works well only with the portfolio consisting of 12-15 quality stocks.

2849 2018-09-19 03:19:33 But at the same time buyers are rushing to grab shares like it's Bitcoin mid 2017. More buyers than sellers for stocks like Tilray.

2852 2018-09-19 03:17:23 You are right interest rates are irrelevant. Let them go to ten percent. Stocks always go higher. No risk. The last ten years are easy stay long and bullish and short the VIX.  By the way have you ever met a wealthy technical analyst?
2853 2018-09-19 03:17:05 How much has gas gone up? Food? You are lucky. Most people have not seen a positive gain. Farmers are losing their farms, job creation has slowed down. Most ppl don't own stocks so market doesn't matter.
2854 2018-09-19 03:16:20 That's the literal point of a stock split, to maintain overall value but split it into bite sized chunks. This is exactly what we want when land is too expensive for most to afford, for the exact same reason as it's done for stocks!

2887 2018-09-19 02:57:44 I just started getting into stocks. I downloaded the Robinhood app. BE MY STOCK BUDDY lol
2888 2018-09-19 02:57:30 As a man who pays close attention to every listed company, I maintain my stance, and if the company takes a hit from this (which again IMO, it won't), I'll throw more money at the stocks. He is neither unprepared not incompetent, there's deeper chess being played here.
2889 2018-09-19 02:57:17 I haven't checked my stocks in a minute
2890 2018-09-19 02:57:10 That's right as long as it respects the 9 EMA as support it's on, a much tighter support area would be 4 EMA...
2891 2018-09-19 02:55:33 It’s currently reserved but we’ll be having stocks again around 2nd-3rd week of October~
2892 2018-09-19 02:55:24 Will India equities get the benefit of upside momentum on Asian stocks, when in @RBI rate hike mode to arrest ₹ weakness at 72.50-75 and weak 10Y bond 7.17% 2028 despite elevated at 8.10-8.25% of big picture 8.0-8.35%?

2918 2018-09-19 02:34:28 The stock market has just shrugged off some seemingly bad news: 10 yr over 3%; tarrifmania; Kavanaugh Democrat circus; Amazon 3% drop; GS concern..and sentiment cautious, hedge funds bearish, late inning speeches... so bullish for stocks

2920 2018-09-19 02:34:15 "I came to the conclusion that the only stocks which would be of real interest to me would be those that were breaking all previous records: stocks not merely rising in price, but actually in their highest boxes ever."  - Nicolas Darvas
2921 2018-09-19 02:33:45 TLRY up 150% since this tweet lol fundamental analysis is meaningless in the short term price action of these stocks. They’re all grossly overvalued at their current state but it doesn’t matter
2922 2018-09-19 02:33:22 kss and his partner recommended to sell vktx around 5 and to put money into $cwbr. these guys just love to pump their stocks not sure if they are part of stock promotion whereby pumping individual stocks and sucking in retail investors
2923 2018-09-19 02:33:07 And I do own something which are my stocks .  almost forgot 
2924 2018-09-19 02:31:43 $6-$8 for years - so hold if you got in below $6 or slightly above $6

NIO does not co-produce batteries or like $TSLA with $PCRFY OR $BYDDF.

Short Lithium stocks if you have them.
2925 2018-09-19 02:31:11 @melloesquire how do you guys perceive the buckeyes RBs as pro prospects? Does splitting carries hurt either one of their stocks as a pro? #draftondraft
2926 2018-09-19 02:30:31 Yes I don’t like to buy over valued stocks. And use the done to death “ it’s a 10 year story “ to soothe my nerves !  A stock bought at screaming valuations  with regular dictats coming 15 days later ? Sorry !
2927 2018-09-19 02:29:20 No problem with getting you 15% commission. Just get me live stocks hauler..

2930 2018-09-19 02:26:50 My stocks are shooting and I need to buy more someone cash app me and I'll buy stocks in your name. Cannabis stock starting $35 going up by $3 a day for about a week now!!
2931 2018-09-19 02:26:35 First, there are no ETFs on the NYSE. There used to be, but they got banished to NYSE-ARCA, and never amounted to more than 5% of issues. Whether their trading by investors affects individual stocks (which drive the HO signal) is harder to quantify. I don't think it matters much.

2936 2018-09-19 02:20:45 There is a difference between the actual product and the stock market, in case you're not aware of it. Didn't they teach you any of this is school? Just because an industry begins to do well, after many years of being stagnant, does not mean stocks immediately respond.

2939 2018-09-19 02:18:23 Oh but the reason @Nike stock rose today was increased sales projections. Awkward! You're right, though. Stocks can be manipulated. Unlike, say, inauguration attendance figures.

2941 2018-09-19 02:18:07 Nothing wrong with shorting stocks. Having short interest only helps the stock price in event of a squeeze. The propagation of FUD, false information, or selective timing of bad news to create a stock downfall is what's disgusting.

Shorting = masturbation. Do it privately.

2949 2018-09-19 02:13:17 How much of today’s action was due to companies buying back stock before they went into their blackout period? Companies can’t buy back in the 5 weeks before reporting earnings. Fin stocks report first— so their blackout is first. Reason for recent underperformance?
2950 2018-09-19 02:12:00 Pot stocks have finally started to decouple from each other for the last few weeks. I think that it probably will have a seismic effect but it’s possible if it’s not too quick and too severe it may not spread like we think.

2971 2018-09-19 01:50:19 So what? I get to buy stocks with no commissions. Why should I care that an HFT wants that data? To charge me a few cents mark up on the liquid large cap stock that I buy?

2973 2018-09-19 01:48:39 Well deserved! I recently got my first dividends from Starbucks, KMB, and Target and a nice amount of growth since I got them at reasonable valuations. You definitely inspired me to have a nice chunk of my savings going towards dividend stocks.
2974 2018-09-19 01:47:27 Contestant on #Chopped just talked about how she’s really good with stocks and will probably invest the 10K winnings if she wins.  And one of the judges was Martha Stewart? Has this been discussed? Shouldn’t it be?

3002 2018-09-19 01:27:19 #Stocks,#Indexes NDX top signal likely early tomorrow.  SPX also manifests an emerging top signal, but not impressive; characteristics normally present are either absent or of low fidelity.
3003 2018-09-19 01:26:14 Figured as much . So sad. Stupid rule. I'm not typically a day trader but if something pops 5+% in day I tend to sell it..even if I bought it that morning.. trading 100+ stocks..it can happen more than thrice a week. Not being able to sell a sinking ship would really suck!!
3004 2018-09-19 01:26:10 Put my money in pot stocks and wait till August to get into crypto

3008 2018-09-19 01:22:47 “Trump’s economy” is riding the trend that started under Obama. 

Obama exceeded 4.1% growth four times. Average new jobs per month were higher than trump’s for a sustained period. Stocks went from 8,000 to 20,000. 

Thanks Obama.

3010 2018-09-19 01:22:43 Not gonna lie though, I was so clueless of a trader not so long ago that I now study the trades I did win to see if it was just luck. Probably was considering the stocks never touched any other support levels that I drew out, and still has some uphill momentum.

3020 2018-09-19 01:14:00 @PeterSchiff there is an artificial sea of liquidity.  As interest rates rise, credit will contract.  Stocks will fall, bonds will collapse, businesses will fail.  The only way to prevent this from happening is for the FED to print trillions, but then it sacrifices the dollar.

3035 2018-09-19 01:03:34 US stocks rose on Tuesday as investors took a view that the latest shots fired in the trade war between America and China could have been worse.

3047 2018-09-19 00:52:33 Even best stocks, to make a lot of money, have to hold it for a while -- usually three to five years. The combination of knowledge and patience can increase returns from 30% to 3,4, to huge amounts of wealth. But most stocks test people's Patience. $JKS $AMD $Baba $FB $APPL

But, we still want to shout them down from the rooftops. Reminds me of how lizard scared women freak out at its very sight.
