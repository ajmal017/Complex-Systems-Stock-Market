89 2018-05-17 17:24:08 It's rare that you can get a very good return by just owning commodities. Stock a warehouse full of paperclips and watch the money absolutely not pour in.

It isn't just owning *stuff*, it's owning certain classes of stuff with inherent scarcity.

124 2018-05-17 15:53:43 Commodities have broadly been supported by crude oil prices and expectations of still higher crude oil prices. This is why developments that limit impact on Iranian crude exports could influence commodity price trends broadly.

127 2018-05-17 15:18:28 Buying power largely relates to the rapid increase in land value, largely caused by the shift in investment from the commodities markets into the property market. Remember that housing bubble? Commodification of homes.

130 2018-05-17 15:12:54 Baig sb. It has become practice that prices of daily use commodities go up 24 to 48 hours ahead of ramzan. There seems no authority to rid people of the profiteers.

132 2018-05-17 15:10:24 @narendramodi @AmitShah @BJP4India PM sir, I request you to take a cognisance of the increasing fuel prices. High fuel prices have made travel extremely costlier. Commodities are getting costlier too. My humble request to control the prices.

134 2018-05-17 15:07:08 As China moves up value chain/gets richer, it manufactures more and also imports more commodities and more services. IMF data suggests that aggregate c/a imbalances have narrowed since pre-crisis, and the sectoral composition of remaining imbalances has shifted.

154 2018-05-17 14:00:15 You mean Marx's flawed book where commodities have a use-value, exchange value, and the value itself of commodities is determined by the labor used to create the commodities? Hardly economics, more like fairyland when applied to how commodities/resources really work.

160 2018-05-17 13:47:49 Jorge Desormeaux: “Nuestro país tiene una vulnerabilidad importante respecto a otros países del mundo, que es nuestra dependencia de los commodities”
161 2018-05-17 13:47:44 Coming back to initial article; agricultural commodities are traded in well organized markets with efficient price discovery. Capital markets are not allocating more resources to production because it makes no economic sense to do so. That is a supply side constraint
162 2018-05-17 13:41:46 La corrida inicial de EM x fortaleza del dólar tenía sentido. Pero ahora vemos q no arrastró a commodities (al menos x ahora). Q no distingan entre países x sus fundamentos suena ridículo. X ej Real brasileño. Hoy c/ récord posiciones short.

164 2018-05-17 13:38:30 That is assuming that causation (not correlation driven by supply/demand and current account dynamics) drives the relationship between commodities and exchange rates. This is not really a hill worth dying for :)

174 2018-05-17 12:06:56 I understand what you're getting at but my point is a properly allocated portfolio, not overexposed to a single sector or medium (i.e. US equities) will fare just fine when you look out to a 50 year or so return. This includes commodities, foreign equity and bonds

235 2018-05-17 05:47:36 Commodities, other than precious metals, are difficult to own directly in size b/c of the logistics. A barrel of oil is a 31.5 gallon drum worth ~$70 while 1 kg of copper is worth ~$7 whereas 1 kg of gold is worth over $40,000 and takes less than half the space of copper.

247 2018-05-17 04:41:18 A commodity is a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other commodities. @lets_NEUROmkt #NMKTRCH

250 2018-05-17 04:09:07 Please start Agri commodities - ncdex and Cbot data in your software. Waiting eagerly.
251 2018-05-17 03:49:22 No Boletim da Manhã (@tercalivre) de ontem (15/05), Allan entrevista uma especialista em Agro Business onde o assunto gira em torno da compra de commodities pela China e da Psicose Ambientalista.

253 2018-05-17 03:38:00 Dang tropical heat is no problem since I live in south america
but we lack of public commodities grrr
254 2018-05-17 03:27:59 @eikebatista abundante e repensar seu desenvolvimento. Não dá pra ficar vendendo commodities pra sempre. Acredito que a conservação vai ter no futuro um valor muito maior, muito mais relevante, do que a expansão das commodities", profecia
255 2018-05-17 03:02:49 right, it seems abstracted to the point of being meaningless? like...if that "$X net worth" can't be realised into $X of actual currency or real commodities, then, what does it represent exactly
256 2018-05-17 02:58:39 Singapore!! Year long tropical heat but 10/10 public commodities 
257 2018-05-17 02:55:06 Commodities Check

258 2018-05-17 02:28:57 Putting BC’s coast at risk to sell oil to Asia is greed. These other commodities are not oil, nor do they behave the same when they tumble into the sea or catch fire. There are plenty of oil related examples that support the risk I’ve described including the #sanchi this year!
259 2018-05-17 02:19:24 Until people stop seeing animals as commodities. Shit like this will never stop!
260 2018-05-17 02:15:32 guess rebalancing through paying more for an ever rising amount of commodities is still a form of rebalancing.

just didn't happen through manufactures.
261 2018-05-17 02:15:04 I'm not sure what's more disconnected - the graphics or the content. All those example of misogyny listed, all those examples of men feeling entitled to women's bodies, none of that is linked to a sex work culture that says all women are sexual commodities to be purchased?
262 2018-05-17 01:54:02 Commodities reporting! Back to journalism, albeit a very different/niche way.
263 2018-05-17 01:49:14 Ignorant is someone who thinks a POTUS has much impact on the price of oil.  Do you think the commodities crash that coincided with the ending of QE would have happened regardless of which party was in the WH?  Or did all of this just go over your head?
264 2018-05-17 00:58:58 Como siempre comentarios muy interesantes @roberto_ruarte y aprendemos mucho de ellos
Fue ese comentario el que nos llevó en la oficina a buscar alguna correlación y pensamos en el petróleo y oro como commodities
265 2018-05-17 00:43:02 I try not to treat people like commodities.
266 2018-05-17 00:40:36 Precisely in an economy any increase in petroleum products is inflationary. It has a corollary effect in prime commodities. Tax has a very short-term effect on inflation as it adjusts over time. Oil products directly affects inflation as price changes every time.
267 2018-05-17 00:37:47 Thank you for the insightful response. Does that only leave commodities, which include precious metals, as real assets?
268 2018-05-17 00:24:36 Yes. But Twitter profits off of its users. We're not guests, we're commodities.

Twitter is getting something out of us, so therefore users have standing to voice complaints.
269 2018-05-17 00:22:12 Backbones and moral compass are such rare and precious commodities these days.
270 2018-05-17 00:16:52 enquanto o Brasil depende das commodities eu dependo desse menino falando português
271 2018-05-17 00:16:44 Because to Uber, you guys are just commodities, not a human being!! That's why NO customer support!!
