0 2019-01-26 23:58:48 Thanks on the Oprah tip. How about Nancy Pelosi's $29 million? Immoral? I understand a lot of it comes from investments in large companies run by very wealthy CEOs. Isn't she complicit through these investments? By the way do you own any stocks? Even indirectly? 401k? IRA?
1 2019-01-26 23:58:10 How to have lungs? Fame’s measurement is YT views? Maybe wen they get their own dolls ww, soldout concerts (like here they struggle to sell so they need so much ads) & can sell 2 mons stocks of fabric softener in a day [ths still is few to mention] +++
2 2019-01-26 23:55:01 World #wheat ending stocks for 2018-19 were forecast at 263 million tonnes, up 1 million from the November projection but down 7 million tonnes, or 3%, from 270 million tonnes in 2017-18.

3 2019-01-26 23:54:46 @dalvarez45 what kind of stocks are on your horizon to buy soon
4 2019-01-26 23:54:30 the travel rewards forAirlines, hotels and rental cars are quite valuable to some people. Recently bought my first rental property. Now learning and beginning to trade stocks. Working everyday to find new streams of income that will one provide the long term freedom I'm wanting
5 2019-01-26 23:53:31 (Continued.) For example, most of the stocks and bonds are owned by the wealthiest groups. If they have to sell their non-cash assets to pay their taxes, perhaps there will also be less buyers of stocks and bonds in the future. In particular, a shortage of government bond buyers.
6 2019-01-26 23:50:09 Dancing? Hunting for food? Building a fire? Selling stocks?
7 2019-01-26 23:49:30 5th/46 today. Spotted two free stocks to mu opponent (1 sd and one I accidentially dash attacked point blank instead of jabbing which cost me the stock). 10 years of playing and that's  still the worst feeling >__________<'
8 2019-01-26 23:49:06 I guess it is time to buy stocks in generic drug makers, like Teva. Anyway, that's what Buffett did
9 2019-01-26 23:48:35 #Stocks are a constant battle between buyers and sellers. Social media has amplified manipulation to the extreme. Some point congress will have to pass new laws. I imagine there being a group of wealthy investors picking the public’s pockets at will.
10 2019-01-26 23:48:35 United we stand for love of country 
11 2019-01-26 23:48:22 Mi mindset midmatch está por las nubes madre. Me puto descojono de todo, ole mi niño.
Ayuda el comeback factor y tener 3 stocks supongo.
12 2019-01-26 23:48:05 They have been using Ripple, NOT XRP. I’m selling XRP for some ripple stocks.
13 2019-01-26 23:45:53 INTEREST RATES TODAY and RECESSION.   If  economy slows, lowering interest rates may not be enough to stem recession.  If people stop spending because of actual or feared job loss, lower interest don't help much.  Stocks fall after investors see lower interest rates didn't help
14 2019-01-26 23:44:55 Keep going.  You can do it.  This is exactly what we did and the result is that we own 2 houses, $100k+ of stocks, and now get $10K a year in passive income we barely work for.  Most people who are rich started exactly like this somewhere.
15 2019-01-26 23:44:48 Blimey, that's really old. But maybe there are 2 "stocks"? Old papers talk of stocks as populations that move about in space. Stock in the sense of "souche" is an analogy, more abstract.
16 2019-01-26 23:44:13 Thank you so much for including me Mighty Lil Minion! I follow all patriots back!
17 2019-01-26 23:40:13 STOCK REPORT for week & RECESSION.  There is evidence of a global economic slowdown.  And if stocks fall during a recession, why have stocks rallied 12% since Christmas.  One answer may be that investors believe, the federal reserve can save us.  They will reduce interest rates.
18 2019-01-27 23:58:31 Uh yes...considering many countries in the world do not have the freedoms we enjoy... certainly our constitution gives us a good guide dummy...I'm cool with the 18 yr olds havin rifles.. hell im cool with people having bump stocks... not cool with people like you who clearly
19 2019-01-27 23:56:16 He stocks me 
20 2019-01-27 23:54:28 You are going to cause @Starbucks to get massively boycotted by Democrats if you play spoiler to the Dem nominee and help @realDonaldTrump to get re-elected. People will be selling their stocks in response to you running as a leftist Independent. Run as a Dem. #2020election
21 2019-01-27 23:53:40 First of all thats not true....and I distictly remember that situation got him talkIng about bump,
stocks...which are now BANNED. Secondly, we cant deport crazy citizens, unfortunately.
22 2019-01-27 23:52:35 Financial capital invested in existing stocks (as opposed to IPO's that actually generate new means of production) do not add anything to the country's productive capacity. If you sell a million shares of GM and I buy them, not a single additional car is manufactured.
23 2019-01-27 23:52:02 Disinformation, and it being easier to do that than admit a huge moral mistake of epic proportions to one’s self, or clinging on to the idea of “victimhood and persecution” when faced with equality. The same as clients desperate to hang on to stocks/bonds when they are losers...
24 2019-01-27 23:49:18 Lets take a look at the $gold and $silver mining stocks....
25 2019-01-27 23:47:01 One day they will talk about #crypto the same way they talk about #stocks It will be the norm #xrp #skycoin #hot
26 2019-01-27 23:46:10 Not true, he’s the first person to have banned bump-stocks - which can your buddy Obama passed and allowed to exist. While all you in Congress did nothing, he actually did something.
27 2019-01-27 23:44:49 Ils font comme à la caserne ; ils vident les stocks avant les prochaines commandes ;)
28 2019-01-27 23:44:18 In many states its perfectly legal carry a gun like that around, even guns with bum stocks, which have finally been banned .
29 2019-01-27 23:44:07 As a young investor. I have learned more the past couple years from @TraceyRyniec and her podcast. Really easy to follow, formative, and great insight. Thank you! 
#stocks #dreamjob #zacksmarketedge #investors
30 2019-01-27 23:43:10 People in midwest states get tired of the constant push and nit pick over #2A .  They see some saying today your bump stocks tomorrow your guns.  And they are not really wrong in their thinking.
31 2019-01-27 23:41:56 Always an issue round our way on Sat am. Bit of a lottery which outlet has stocks. Keeps my steps up though 
32 2019-01-27 23:40:57 Bump-stocks har blivit olagliga men dom finns i massor ändå, det finns för mycket vapen i omlopp, polisen måste alltid förutsätta att den som dom stoppar är beväpnad och tänker skjuta, då kan man lista ut hur det går om någon har ett leksaksvapen som flashar fram.
33 2019-01-27 23:40:26 Protests This Is Stocks, killed in semi-final NFL History of Educations at Solar solutionship'
34 2019-01-27 23:40:04 Bernie, little? Trump adm banned bump stocks for guns. Fight for what you believe but do it Worthily.
35 2019-01-27 23:39:24 Of course a temporary exit ,this is a multi decade bull market with many one night stands , cannot stay married to PM stocks always however ,lol. Need to move in and out based on charts .
36 2019-01-27 23:37:46 They actually do. It's like a game to them. I know this personally through my ex's family. On days when stocks were doing bad her dad would tip less at restaurants like he was running out of money. He would freak out like was going broke even though he still had millions.
37 2019-01-25 23:58:58 2 and 5 or 2 and 4 and I would invest tat 1mill over 10 stocks and make 20mill easy
38 2019-01-25 23:58:53 I've done okay with dark stocks, You can sell but must wait for financials online. I now own some LINK.
39 2019-01-25 23:58:50 My observations from the numerous training sessions I've attended, are different to your take, but hey, your entitled to your opinion. IMO, our GK stocks have struggled since Ron Corry was dumped from the position
40 2019-01-25 23:56:08 It’s also common knowledge that there was no wrong doing with the Uranium One deal. Frank Giustra resigned from the Uranium One board and sold his stocks in 2007, 3 years before it was sold to Russia. No money to be gained on his behalf. Timeline is black & white on this one.
41 2019-01-25 23:53:55 Maybe we need a special edition of @bbcqt. The ONLY panelist’s are #Brexiteers and everyone else gets to ask real questions. They MUST answer. Would any get through the whole programme?  I’d really like to reinstate the stocks...as the finale.  1/
42 2019-01-25 23:53:15 @jimcramer  people always ask about the same stocks on the lightning round!   What do you think about American Tower

50 2019-01-25 23:42:34 could these be the first signs that supply is catching up to demand ? eventually there will be more supply than demand the question is will this happen sooner than the experts are predicting ? and if so this cant be good for the mj stocks
51 2019-01-25 23:42:29 It’s the Asian market shooting up.

53 2019-01-25 23:40:25 Many stocks just shot up. I assume it's the news of the shutdown?
