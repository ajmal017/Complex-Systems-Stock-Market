1 2018-08-25 23:59:44 I agree with everything.. I just don't agree with the "assault weapon" ban. I own an Ar15. I also know that my Ar15 is not an assault weapon. If it was, I wouldn't own it. Ban the bump stocks, ban any accessory that could make it a assault rifle.

4 2018-08-25 23:58:40 In all, just 54% of Americans invest in the market, either through individual stocks, mutual funds, pensions or retirement plans like a 401(k), according to Gallup. 

That's down 11% since the Great Recession.
5 2018-08-25 23:58:34 Don't you mean "congratulations, rich, old, white friends?" The stocks don't represent real Americans at all. Oh wait. I forgot. You don't care.
6 2018-08-25 23:57:57 Just a thought.
Lefties will attempt to crash the Economy before Midterms.
By selling all their Corporate stocks and making a cash run on banks.
Problem with that plan?

7 2018-08-25 23:57:33 I am really glad I had no stocks in that fight, it was just a money fight, that's all. I can't even compare it to Mayweather v Paq because they're considered the best of this era.

I'd take actually talented nobodies any day before watching these two.

9 2018-08-25 23:56:06 Hey Dotard, what about the 160 million Americans that don’t own any stocks?
10 2018-08-25 23:56:03 LOL,

Who really benefits from stocks?
11 2018-08-25 23:55:52 good i made the decision to move all my stocks to the USA. Excellent.

13 2018-08-25 23:55:09 Nice job Donny . do you know what stocks are and that few Americans own any?
14 2018-08-25 23:55:07 Yeah bc soooo many Americans can afford to own stocks 
15 2018-08-25 23:54:59 The top 10% of income earners own more than 80% of the stocks.  It's such a worthless economic indicator.
16 2018-08-25 23:54:57 Lol. 80% of you don’t have any money in stocks. How is this helping you?
17 2018-08-25 23:54:25 That is if you have stocks

45 2018-08-25 23:50:18 US stocks a record while China’s down $1 trillion plus this year. A reminder who has the leverage in a trade conflict!
46 2018-08-25 23:49:57 Wow Walter,,
Don't worry,
those stocks will trickle down
to you!!
47 2018-08-25 23:49:21 You mean the around 50% who can actually afford stocks. Stock market success has very little to do with the day-to-day struggles of average Americans. You would know that if you actually have a fuck about any of us.

49 2018-08-25 23:48:40 You don’t like that the stocks are high?
50 2018-08-25 23:48:03 When people hear good news, they react with the market. That’s your view, Trump. So when you are implicated in felonies, and the stocks rise, what other conclusion can we reach?
51 2018-08-25 23:47:58 How does that help me @realDonaldTrump ? I don't own stocks.
It does help all the people who are already rich though.
How about raising the minimum wage to help people like me?
52 2018-08-25 23:47:28 good thing every single american owns stocks!

Please add me to your beta list. Been trading options for many years  - swings, debit spreads, day trading. Also penny stocks. All with mixed results using a small account while I learned. I recently figured out that day trading options is best for me.

I love to look at the futures market in sports like stocks to see where the value lies. It’s been great to me each year & I’ve had people continually ask me my thoughts each new season.

63 2018-08-25 23:30:12 I normally say that they'll need an ar15 tp take mine. Then I point out how some states banned bump stocks and no one turned any in. The logistics of having to go door to door in an entire city looking for guns is a nightmare yet alone a state. You would also have to tear apart..

65 2018-08-25 23:29:35 Investors don’t marry their stocks. Some people marry bad crypto projects with no stoploss and are down 90%. If you find the project is no longer viable no shame in taking the loss. Hopefully you didn’t lose money you couldn’t afford, but use the scraps to get into something good
66 2018-08-25 23:29:26 131. There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
67 2018-08-25 23:29:09 On average across the United States, only 18.7% of taxpayers directly own stocks. So, the rich get richer. Hooray?
68 2018-08-25 23:28:13 Universal background checks and banning bump stocks. I know a majority of responsible gun owners agree with both points. Do you?

84 2018-08-25 23:05:41 yet, our government went aggressively after honest American citizens making bump stocks illegal..........and criminals can still use them......makes sense

87 2018-08-25 23:02:33 Best #potstock in my portfolio is $GRPS, no doubt imo. Still sub-penny and Richard Goulding leading this up. He is CEO of $POTN which ran sub penny to over $1 this past January. Authorized Share count is 1B on both of them too. $GRPS will go .10+ imo. All In my opinion. #stocks

90 2018-08-25 22:57:00 Yeah just like a relief pitcher coming in The 9th inning, several runs ahead. All he had to do was NOT blow the lead! He deregulated tons artificially juicing some stocks, it’s also what led to the 2008 recession in the first place. So let’s not give him the Cy Young just yet.
91 2018-08-25 22:56:36 They really want to accuse YG of mediaplay so badly... And if Naver or LVMH are the ones investing in YG, they would have more say/power in how things are decided... So they can say good things or bad things.. Thats the buying power of having stocks/stakehold in a company...
92 2018-08-25 22:56:36 How about Obama and ATF allowing “bump stocks”. Nice .. it’s funny how no one wants to talk about that.
93 2018-08-25 22:55:51 Sorry Mr.Stocks, I'll try again some other time :)
94 2018-08-25 22:54:23 Stocks are on the bottom, except for Preferred, it was the Bond holders who got a hair cut, they are on the top.  But before all that the Pension funds should have all been honored.  Been a long time since business college, I could be mistaken.

113 2018-08-25 22:39:42 Frankly, my stocks have been going sideways as the tariff bluff BS has been going on. Seems some sectors and regions are adding jobs while others lose them.

Some would trade on stocks/currencies/commodities on an online platform  (1)

Put all their savings into pickle stocks. Can't retire.
140 2018-08-25 22:16:52 Either that or natural gas stocks for those preferring barbecue.
141 2018-08-25 22:16:25 Yes, Yet some stocks are being recommended. Area, of course price, cost of materials, solar impact, interest rates, land prices all have impact. Housing stocks, among the top performers of 2017, have seen 6 yrs. of growth since 2011. Rising interest rates cause uncertainty.

145 2018-08-25 22:14:13 For strict value, usually not. We have, however, seen some great performing strategies that buy the stocks with the best momentum from a group with the best value scores. Indeed, there are several strategies that have really done well that use both.
146 2018-08-25 22:13:28 I could live with that... A lot of Trumperoids would be “offing” themselves. But I could live with that too. Funeral stocks could be YUGE.

154 2018-08-25 22:08:52 Hey Joe: Average people aren’t feeling this so-called “strong economy.” We have stagnant wages, high cost of housing, food, gas, etc. Only the wealthy feel it due to their tax cuts, stocks, etc.

Rates rising, cost of goods, price per sq.ft. and much more have an impact. Sebring Florida prices grew and going higher.

160 2018-08-25 21:56:16 plz this scumbag Hunter is no different than the scumbag in Chief Trump. They’ll throw every last human under the bus before taking responsibility. I’m sure Duncan had a talk like “If I go down, we go down” with his wife. Just like Trump saying “if I’m impeached stocks will fall”
161 2018-08-25 21:54:43 You are clearly new to stock trading because this is how majority of OTC stocks operate and most of them end up being scams
162 2018-08-25 21:52:47 Agreed.  Been trading stocks and forex lately and the luxury of having so many charts to pass on and look for good setups  not taking btc trades til we’re trending again it’s a waste of time
163 2018-08-25 21:51:16 The good economy is only helping rich people and those invested in stocks.

165 2018-08-25 21:48:59 @jimcramer Hi.  I’ve recently been learning and trying to understand stocks.  Would you suggest someone with low savings, invest their money versus a savings? Also, my mom invested in WSFS decades ago for me, would you suggest selling all and investing in something with growth?
166 2018-08-25 21:48:58 Professional money managers and hedge funds start to get back to their offices this week, many if not all are lagging the indices. That should create a lot of buying pressure on stocks over the next few weeks.
167 2018-08-25 21:48:09 It's not that he's on massive wedge, supposedly he's got a big appearance fee bonus. So if he plays he costs more. We can all agree we'd rather have Stocks or Tom in goal but we don't sadly, just gotta support the team that's playing #BCFC
168 2018-08-25 21:46:36 I actually might agree w/ every other Gerber Kawasaki holding, but Ross's vocal-ness with Tesla....simply makes me shake my head. Bullishness on NVDA, I agree w/ 100%; pot stocks, he probably has a good point there; Tesla though...I don't see a sustainable competitive advantage
169 2018-08-25 21:43:21 Man I was so close to beating dabuz in the collegiate  it was last stock last hit 3 stocks each.

171 2018-08-25 21:41:47 Je vais vérifier les stocks le plus possible et si ça part j’achète je crois
172 2018-08-25 21:40:54 Fourth option: they and anyone who genuinely cares about this ‘fight’ should be put in stocks.
173 2018-08-25 21:40:33 Hi there do you remember my mum celia stocks?

176 2018-08-25 21:37:57 End of the article is a good prediction: Turkish stocks which are now undervalued will be very attractive to the same people who brought the currency down.
177 2018-08-25 21:37:42 Exactly. Neither hawkish nor dovish, but certainly bearish stocks  #crisis #crash
178 2018-08-25 21:37:30 The 25% gold/silver/diamonds, is that physical, equities, or both? And what kind of stocks are we talking about?

182 2018-08-25 21:34:26 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.(No.131) #Duo30L11
183 2018-08-25 21:32:53 Well I know Trump wanted to ban bump stocks last year which is the part put on the gun that essentially turns it into an automatic weapon I think they are working on that.  But @TheDemocrats also get money from the NRA which is why they also haven’t introduced legislation
184 2018-08-25 21:31:38 You mean, Lancaster street stocks?
185 2018-08-25 21:29:17 And Kickstarter isn't a store; it's an investment in a company and the dividends are products not stocks or cash payments.
186 2018-08-25 21:29:01 Oui oui, j'ai vu. Dès jeudi soir d'ailleurs à 00h quand j'ai reçu toutes les notifs Amazon de stocks en ligne à 1200 euros. Y'en a même un qui l'a proposé à 2999 € et un autre à 5999 €. Il devait manquer un peu de cash pour finaliser le crédit de leur voiture je pense.
187 2018-08-25 21:28:12 Top 4 stocks to watch for the week: $LAZ, $NTES, $QSR, $WLTW, all may climb w/in 11, 12, 9, 10 days up to 1.2%, 4.2%, 2.6%, 2.2% respectively

189 2018-08-25 21:25:50 i thought i had read they were still keeping a lid on fiscal for the most part? if youre right, plus powells recent relatively less hawkish lean, stocks are about to go on a rampage
190 2018-08-25 21:22:59 @realDonaldTrump what would have happened to Social Security if it had been invested in Stocks the past 20 or 30 or 40 etc years as opposed to Democrats spending it? @Feisty_FL @Jami_USA

193 2018-08-25 21:19:02 @ YouTube this why your stocks look like this :)
194 2018-08-25 21:18:23 Wow! The crowds are so diverse there! Hope you mentioned things like equality, compassion, protecting Medicaid, and integrity. Maybe banning bump stocks and working across the aisle with your colleagues? But...somehow, I doubt it. #ReadyForRosen
195 2018-08-25 21:17:50 What I noticed was that he felt the market was overvalued right from 1957 onwards.. and it went higher and higher until 1970. He didn't try to time the markets.. just kept his focus on picking stocks!
196 2018-08-25 21:16:57 You gotta take 4 stocks in 2 matches. 2 minute timer both games

202 2018-08-25 21:11:52 I realized how it works: game gets announced, stores sign for copies to be sent in, game releases and sells, game company and stores profit which also effects stocks, everyone’s happy. Am I right?

205 2018-08-25 21:07:04 He probably does trade stocks for his 401k. I do that for my retirement fund.
206 2018-08-25 21:06:56 Sure! Titan isn't a bet on tech stocks or a specific sector like QQQ is. The funds that Titan follows tend to invest in high quality co's with secular growth. Today that growth is strongest in tech, but in mid-2000s, it was industrials. Titan identifies those shifts dynamically.
207 2018-08-25 21:05:45 Thank you D!
Yes, stocks with dividends are not Ponzi by definition. But, most firms don't pay and those that do are paying less and less. I focused on cap-gains/Ponzi profits cuz that’s what the ScamArtist @cnbc and textbooks  focus on;)
208 2018-08-25 21:03:25 Trades what?  Is he a trader?  I'm sure he own stocks and bonds. Maybe commodities.
209 2018-08-25 21:00:48 Monk is doing so much right but not starting Stocks & Adams is shooting yourself in the foot. I cannot believe that 1st team players think Camp & Bogle are better?
210 2018-08-25 20:59:37 Stocks have their seasons and fashions. For example, as everyone knows, the best season for the motor and tire stocks is in the spring and summer. The stock market generally discounts this activity a little in advance. #tasi
211 2018-08-25 20:58:32 Trading stocks for a living is tough. It's all about consistency. You can make $1,000 one day and lose $3,000 the next day.
212 2018-08-25 20:55:37 you really are clueless--moving stocks is an indication of relevancy but you wouldnt know about that would you?

219 2018-08-25 20:49:09 I am lucky I have Asda, Waitrose, Sainsbury's, Tesco all within a short drive.  I go to Sainsbury cos it stocks the pizza he likes. Asda do too so maybe go to Asda next week.  We have a Lidl store somewhere behind Asda.  I thought small local shops were more expensive.
220 2018-08-25 20:48:46 Gold will spike to between $3,000 and $5,000 per ounce... Specific mining stocks could climb to 4,237%...

And certain cryptocurrencies could be looking at 100X gains!

It could be the defining moment of the 21st century.
221 2018-08-25 20:47:00 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
222 2018-08-25 20:45:41 The stock market is exactly that. Stocks. How many blue collar Americans have the luxury of playing the market? That is not a real indicator of the economy. It is more of an indicator of a wealthy person's gameplay. Smoke and mirrors.
223 2018-08-25 20:43:12 I figured some of you guys interested in these stocks played back then! 
224 2018-08-25 20:40:58 On va dire que Noz ce n'est pas la même chose. Déjà ce sont souvent des invendus ou des entreprises qui font faillite et par conséquent, ils doivent vendre leurs stocks. J'ai déjà trouvé mon bonheur chez Noz au niveau des livres !

228 2018-08-25 20:35:49 I love that place! I haven’t been in ages, once they opened Ambar we could get our Balkan fix easier. I need to replenish my stocks and get more Hungarian paprika from there, also going to try to make my own Sarma this fall and they sell the correct type of fermented cabbage
229 2018-08-25 20:34:14 If Monk thinks his strongest 11 includes Camp & Bogle he’s deluded. Swallow your pride and start Stocks & Adams as both proven in the Championship. Persisting with Camps & Bogle will get us relegated.

234 2018-08-25 20:27:36 I think "1 seed vs lower seeds in PP is pointless" is way closer to "1 seed vs lower seeds in D1 or top 16" is a much more reasonable comparison than "5 stocks vs 99 stocks".

238 2018-08-25 20:19:02 How about the Republicans who voted for said tax gift to themselves & 1,229 corporations (who bought back stocks to boost prices & defend against takeovers) require their children pay back the 1st $500B. They'll have rcvd that much by then.

Seems about right, don't you think?
239 2018-08-25 20:17:58 There’s a few more things the US can do to regulate guns, because I agree the amount of people who have guns that shouldn’t is way too high. Bump stocks would be number one, beaf the process to purchase a gun to include psychological screenings and bar people who have had/

If you think the economy is getting better you know nothing about economics. And certainly Trump knows nothing about economics. His trade deals are BS.

317 2018-08-25 18:43:44 We seem to disagree on this, maybe for reasons of definition, but say I fear a correction and sell all stocks. (Shorting seems too dangerous) How can this move be part of a zero sum game?

319 2018-08-25 18:40:23 Am i wrong if I say that a trader can earn 15 to 20% easily if trader has 10 crores and manipulates just 1 stock along with derivatives trading. Many times i feel so. After ban period suddenly stocks jump 5%. After removing from ASM list stocks jump 40% in a month.

324 2018-08-25 18:36:42 I look around, i see the stocks doing very well, i see employment needed signs everywhere, it seems like the economy is doing *gasp* better than Obama's! Supply side economics, while not perfect, is still better than democrats demand side economics or socialism.
325 2018-08-25 18:36:20 You can apply this strategy in any cal/put, OTM options is only for sell..60% nifty/ stocks are in consolidation phase through out the month..40% risk is there..but u have 2 buffer...OTM+PREMIUM should cross on short time of span after this volatile move you have chance to escape

336 2018-08-25 18:30:05 What percentage of the US actually owns stocks? It seems to me that the tax cut gift will more than cover the losses of the 1% and the working poor can’t afford to invest. The ones hit will be middle income with investments in mutual funds and that’s only if this pred is true.

338 2018-08-25 18:29:44 I think the gold move is a sign that people are moving out of super safe assets for balance sheet hedging. That said another big push in US stocks is highly likely and trade wars won't affect that....

347 2018-08-25 18:21:13 that sector only works if you are trading, in the long term gold stocks are potentially the worst buy and hold sector in the market thats why I dont like the rethoric about crashes in the general markets and the superiority of gold thats BS, so cross fingers if we both are right
348 2018-08-25 18:20:29 @StephenMoore just watched you on CNN and guess what? some things are more important than money...as for the stock markets the vast MAJORITY of American citizens don't even own stocks so why would they care about that? There is a CROOK in the OVAL OFFICE he needs to be ousted!
349 2018-08-25 18:20:28 But to be fair, We all take inspiration from others for sure though. For instance Jim Reid at Deutsch in’13 did cool chart of analysis of UK stocks sensitivity to int. Rts that was brilliant..which gave me idea to do similar but for US stocks. Did I source him? Nope
350 2018-08-25 18:19:16 Nowadays, if I am not thinking about stocks, I am thinking about self- development and good karma. Going to reinvent myself.

351 2018-08-25 18:18:32 Also, will it be possible to give filter stocks approaching 52 week high or low? Can come handy to trade trends.
352 2018-08-25 18:16:06 yep, actually I am trading gold stocks since 2004 you too? and I made more profits than losses which is seldom in this sector unless u know the cycles (its 95% down and 300% up), I bought back into juniors in automn 2014 when some eternal bulls got bearish....best sign!
353 2018-08-25 18:16:00 Because @NRA won’t allow gun records to be computerized, because @NRA won’t allow bump stocks to be banned, because @NRA thinks everyone should have military grade weapons, because @NRA said nothing when BABIES were murdered in Sandy Hook... I could go on but why should I?

377 2018-08-25 17:48:30 ah yes take advice from an opinion writer of a newspaper that has a rapidly dwindling readership plummeting stocks and lay offs. I guess she must know about being self destructive as she is part of it everyday at her work.
378 2018-08-25 17:47:28 To think that we can predict the movement of the stock market weekly or monthly is just fooling ourselves. A real investor is one whose time horizon is at least a year or two preferably five or ten or more. #stocks # wsj # investing

394 2018-08-25 17:32:40 A tidbit from my studies... Dip buying is not the same as buying beaten down stocks. Especially micro caps! You always need a reversal confirmation to confirm an entry on the long side ie price action/reaction to a reversal catalyst
395 2018-08-25 17:32:34 Let’s wait for his impeachment and then buy the stocks since they’d all be so cheap.
396 2018-08-25 17:32:14 When I have symptoms like that it helps to limit my fluid intake, get in a hot bath, and find a wonderful friend to go get cranactin (whole foods usually stocks them). Then I take like 6 and put on a sweet movie to distract my brain from discomfort.
397 2018-08-25 17:31:46 Hunting, yes. Semi-/full automatic military grade weaponry with high capacity magazines & bump stocks absolutely not. No other purpose for them other than to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time. A "modern rifle" is NOT an AR-15.
398 2018-08-25 17:31:22 Sears stocks have fallen and they’re closing 30 stores, wow. #HRTribe
399 2018-08-25 17:30:40 Yet only one party gave them huge tax breaks that 96% of them used to buy back stocks instead of pass it on to employees 
400 2018-08-25 17:30:23 Washington Post: The American Deplorables are to believe your trash filled lies when it's just been uncovered and Proven Hubby/Diane Feinsteins own 10% of Media news stocks..huge percentage enough for them to Dictate the lies to put in your rags! Surprise ppl it IS Fake News!
401 2018-08-25 17:30:21 You should consider investing in Orville Redenbacher stocks!
402 2018-08-25 17:27:40 Stocks go up, executives and chair holders get bonuses. Stocks go down, they fire everyone but the executives and chair holders, rename and rebrand, reopen 3 years later doing exactly the same thing.
403 2018-08-25 17:27:36 Es posible, la logica detras de ese escenario seria que la FED pausaría en el futuro inmediato su alza en las tasas, eso permitiría que el mercado accionario continue el alza. El tema ahi es que historicamente esas correlaciones positivas entre UST y stocks no duran mucho
404 2018-08-25 17:27:04 You don’t need to know 20 different ways to trade stocks, just one way that works for you, and a set up your patient enough to what for.
405 2018-08-25 17:26:01 250 is just your fear playing on you. You need to be optimistic if you plan on getting your money back. If you sold the stocks already then you already lost.
406 2018-08-25 17:25:46 That is why they say buy the leaders but then leaders will come expensive...then on the contrary you will say don’t buy expensive stocks...whats the solution
407 2018-08-25 17:25:22 I am happy to have ED as our president . With all our support he will bring back our country’s status . Fathers and mothers lets pull up our stocks and tighten our belts to work for our country.Lets pray for our president to appoint the men who are eager to work for the good of

It was a Short at 500 with SL @ 525. 
I do not trade much in stocks. Obviously, I didn't keep track of it. It gave signs of exhaustion in Uptrend in July.
Market gives you signs before big move
409 2018-08-25 17:21:23 Yeah and you brought up the stocks not me. So i proved myself to be right about that. And as for medical marijuana they are fighting hard against it when they tell their members to vote no. Even if they don’t like how prop 2 is written. Still they are fighting against it.

411 2018-08-25 17:20:13 I don't see one that big this next round. Perhaps something that nukes a bunch of Boomer retirements in stocks, what does have me concerned is the fed doesn't have the same tools available as last time to help a recovery

422 2018-08-25 17:10:07 Hypothetically speaking, if one sells his/her other stocks at a "loss" to purchase the TSLA stock shares based on 'funding secured' $420 as an incentive, will that "loss" be qualified for legal action due to stock manipulation?
423 2018-08-25 17:09:32 @BBCNews @AFP @DefenceHQ @DyfedPowys @nytimes @GlosSaferCyber @TheEconomist @euronews Quite a few corner shops do not sell and still seem able to trade. @metpoliceuk I wonder who launders money, stocks all sorts, allows their address to be used for ‘businesses’ that are fake.
424 2018-08-25 17:06:58 But 58 killed and 851 wounded in Las Vegas means bump stocks are cool.

Fox News, your own reporters are jumping ship.

428 2018-08-25 17:01:24 Cathie Wood has been extremely successful when it comes to picking out disruptive innovation stocks..She’s  brilliant.
429 2018-08-25 17:00:48 Wrong. Rising stock market means investment into companies. The Bull market is a direct reflection of a healthy economy. The 2009 recession brought stocks down. Catapillar at the time traded at $44.00 dollars per share. Now $138.21 as of Friday close.
430 2018-08-25 17:00:30 When you own over a billion dollars in pharmaceutical stocks, probably shouldn’t be preaching about the “dangers” of cannabis. Just not a good look. That’s all I’m going to say on this. Just explaining the backlash.
431 2018-08-25 16:59:07 Doesn't their Dad(s) contribute to the financial well being of his children? And if your stocks aren't going up, with the longest bull run in history, sounds like you need a better financial advisor. And you are a worker in a shitty job, find a way get to get a better one.
432 2018-08-25 16:58:58 59 people would be alive today, 59, if bump stocks were not legal,  not counting hundreds wounded.
433 2018-08-25 16:58:53 Don’t forget about his best friend Marty Nesbitt he always knew what stocks to short before the government “attacked” them.he made millions. Schweitzer books on Obama and Hillary must read .

436 2018-08-25 16:56:40 Breadth is statistically good because of the rally in the bond market. This affects tons of interest rate sensitive stocks and preferred stocks. Breadth of economic sensitive stocks is not good at all. When liquidity decreases bond and stocks compete for it.
437 2018-08-25 16:55:20 Stocks go down?
438 2018-08-25 16:54:15 He wasn't using an assault rifle. He was using two AR-15s with bump stocks. If we were to ban bump stocks he would've shot them anyway. Slower than before? Yes, but the change in numbers would be minimal.

440 2018-08-25 16:53:10 “Mr. Rahn was selling stocks in small batches multiple times a day. In April 2017, he sold between 75 and 125 shares of Exxon eight times in one day, rather than all at once, generating commissions on each sale.” 

I thought bitcoin was the fraud, Jamie.
441 2018-08-25 16:53:09 No shares on the OTC?  Does @tdameritrade allow for buying canadian stocks yet?
442 2018-08-25 16:51:03 Very telling that he thinks all people care about is the stock market.  I’d be willing to bet most of his supporters do not own stocks.
443 2018-08-25 16:50:29 Oh...heavily invested in coal stocks? So you *are* going to go broke after Trump's impeached. Sad...but tell me do you know the diff between a short term and a long term investment? My contention is that there's no *future* in coal.

460 2018-08-25 16:35:54 That’s your view. And also a view of an investor who bought $EFA & $EEM in 2016. 

That doesn’t have to be the view for US stocks, up record 10 years in the row. How can the bull be only 2 years old?

I’ve heard the arguments and I don’t agree. Every asset has its own cycle.

Y más teniendo en cuenta que $NTNX ya retrasó sin fecha el proyecto cloud para hacerle competencia a Amazon . Solo digo que cuidado . Pero suerte a los que la tengáis.

518 2018-08-25 15:38:52 Mira la capitalización más que el valor de la accion . NTNX ya vale 9bn . No creo que sea una compañía de 90bn. Si quieres ejemplos : BZUN ha pasado en 2 años de 5 a 53, la diferencia es que ahora vale 2,5bn creo , viene de 200mn .

525 2018-08-25 15:31:27 No investment decision is easy and all junior mining stocks carry risk...lots of it. On the other hand nobody is going to make a fortune investing in Mutual Funds or fixed income securities. You need to carefully look at each company and especially its management. Buyer beware.

527 2018-08-25 15:30:22 1/ the psychology of trading/invest is one of the most important topics. when anyone talks about a stock here always analyse it well with chart & fundamentals, never chase any stock that gets tipped over on twitter. I lost quite a few rises on stocks but never bothers me,
528 2018-08-25 15:29:51 Ring it in at Walmart. And FYI idk how big your bubble is but if the Mormon youth wanted to smoke weed, (like I’ve seen many) they can still get it quite easy. You will only make those who need it suffer. And you are only protecting pharmaceutical stocks but whatever

534 2018-08-25 15:24:37 Dispite all stories stock is trading at 52 weel low...rather 7 pct down in 1 year...where all fmcg companies and other growth stocks who came out with decent no. Up 10 to 20 pct after results n FCL is down 12 pct after results

539 2018-08-25 15:17:30 I think it would do these eBay resellers well to take their $1000 and buy a diverse portfolio of penny stocks instead.
540 2018-08-25 15:12:57 Money on the sidelines doesn’t exist. Stock market is a zero sum game. For every buyer there is a seller, so there is always money on the sidelines... somewhere.

547 2018-08-25 15:05:49 Sir, I'm willing to learn options trading. And my current knowledge is about technical indicators. So, how can I select the stocks for each day and how to select the particular premium for the selected stock?? From where shall I start sir?

550 2018-08-25 15:02:03 I'm been an expatriate half my life. First Asad said "Be Bullish On Pakistan & Invest In Engro Stocks & Bonds" and I invested and lost millions thanks to a 73% drop in stock & bond prices when Engro almost sank in 2012. Now Asad wants me to invest in Pakistan? I'll never do that!
551 2018-08-25 15:00:15 The stock market in general is in for a cold reality check. Wouldn't want to be holding pot stocks when a correction happens.

617 2018-08-25 14:01:17 Here's how it was done. You borrowed a trillion dollars from China, and added it to the debt. You gave that trillion dollars to your richest friends through tax cuts. They, in turn, bought stocks with the money to get even richer. And ordinary taxpayers are stuck with the bill.

658 2018-08-25 13:28:03 One of the more important ones involved me investing into the stocks of a company and receiving a significant return, almost instantly.

Now, if I can just remember which company it was...

660 2018-08-25 13:25:11 Doesn’t change the facts that unemployment is way down and stocks are way up. You people are so fixated on bashing that you couldn’t see the whole truth if it literally slapped you.
661 2018-08-25 13:23:37 In theory, tax payers underwrites the stocks, whose debt is honoured in the event of a crisis. Seemingly in reality and given moral hazard, government underwrites everything.
662 2018-08-25 13:22:45 I’ll buy stocks that day just to ease the ride. And I think the market will jump when he goes.
663 2018-08-25 13:22:18 You used it here....Once they know the Tariffs are gone and his crazy uncertainty is gone - STOCKS and ECONOMY GONNA GROW !
664 2018-08-25 13:22:07 Not hiring me genius. My stocks and my 401 have exploded since he took office. Nice try though sweetheart.
665 2018-08-25 13:21:06 Well.. If you are believing in what analysts say you should not be involved with stocks. The cash situation is just desperate and the bonds keep on sinking amid more losses and cash burn. You will learn this soon enough in Tesla's case.

667 2018-08-25 13:19:08 No body can predict when this will happen so looking at charts I like to short stocks below 200d and have longer term time in decline
668 2018-08-25 13:18:55 Becoming obsessed with stocks is not good for anybody. You need to find that balance and enjoy the process. Patience and effort is required and you cannot rush things. Go at your own pace and don't compare yourself to others. You are running your own race.
669 2018-08-25 13:17:06 McCain sat in the office of his "captors" shooting the breeze while his fellow captors were left outside with their feet ROTING in stocks! The FIRST THING he did when captured was scream that his grandfather was a GENERAL! #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
670 2018-08-25 13:15:30 That tweet was wordly quite badly in my decision. The Palaces now really focus on keeping stocks of older postcards. The exhibitions they stage coule have newer cards, like the KP Diana Dresses that have produced a set of cards
671 2018-08-25 13:15:29 Yup they sure are down. Thanks for pumping your garbage mining stocks for the last 2 years. Everyone who reads this, do the opposite of everything these hucksters recommend and you’ll be very wealthy.
672 2018-08-25 13:14:16 Maybe were going after this wrong. Maybe we should approach gun mfrs to consider sensible gun laws. It would save them legal troubles & a lot of lobbying money. The truth is few of us want to ban guns entirely. We jwant to ban assault rifles & bump stocks & want background checks

697 2018-08-25 12:49:31 Players of the stock market loved the last recession. It lowered stock prices to rock bottom prices. They snatched up the cheap stocks. Since the market has rallied in bull fashion ever since the recession, they all made out like bandits.
698 2018-08-25 12:49:24 Jewellery demand not likely to be there from keralites, as they account for 18% of gold demand. Short jewellery stocks in India.
699 2018-08-25 12:46:54 Our leader stocks are pretty decent. Rough, Smith, Gunston, Shiels and in a year or so JOM would all be suitable for me.

704 2018-08-25 12:41:54 And thus began the #potstocks legalization mark up run. Did you seriously believe the big boys were going to let people buy these stocks at summer prices in the fall when the media will be pumping out headlines? Mark up the prices before the news frenzy then cash out.
705 2018-08-25 12:41:26 not actually they should get paid more (but be banned from trading stocks and getting lobbyist jobs and for at least 15 dollars an hour) @ryangrim makes a good case on why we should pay our congress member more
706 2018-08-25 12:40:44 If you're at a health store (Wellness Warehouse maybe) ask for a Kombucha kit. I think the one on Kloof stocks it. I prefer kombucha to milk kefir. Maybe wena uzoyithanda.
707 2018-08-25 12:39:59 True.
Puts r natural hedges/insurance for long stocks so puts are in more demand and buyers are ready to pay a bit more, hence higher IVs for puts
Whereas CEs are used in strategies like covered call where CEs are shorted, so sellers are ready to short it even at lower premiums
708 2018-08-25 12:39:23 Are you on the pipe, wake up it’s all good behind the smoke the fake news is putting out. Job growth, stocks up, welfare down, public confidence up except for fake new and its followers.
709 2018-08-25 12:37:32 Habrá que  estar atentos .
710 2018-08-25 12:37:19 Much worse than that given that 1) stocks are valued based on future activity not past activity & 2) forward PE (accounting for strong economy and dumb tax cuts) is in-line with history.

713 2018-08-25 12:36:40 High valuations don't mean stocks will tumble. But it does suggest future returns will likely be modest -- and that means workers should save more for retirement and retirees should be prepared to spend less.

734 2018-08-25 12:16:16 Thank you. But I meant was purely from liquidating perspective in case the stock falls. I agree that such stocks are hidden gems and I too trade/invest in those stocks for a shorter time horizon. But you would agree that if one wants to liquidate in full there may be issue.

754 2018-08-25 11:56:36 Having a portfolio 100% stocks is risky. I’m more of a Jack Bogle investor. Pretty boring. If I knew who you were I could follow your investment advice. But I can’t.
755 2018-08-25 11:53:33 #Trump, Resign, stocks don’t worry me, I don’t have any.
756 2018-08-25 11:53:02 Agree that would go no where.  I do think eliminating the sale of high capacity mags (over 7 or 10) and bump stocks could work.  Issue is there are a lot already out there.  Use of either in a crime is automatic huge jail time?
757 2018-08-25 11:50:53 @NSEIndia super senior citizen. like to close stock accounts. but some stocks delisted. how to close them.

760 2018-08-25 11:48:12 Exactly, Im skeptical on that one. Im a rare breed of 55% bull, 45% bear melntality :) there is a lot of shit, but there is a dimond in the pile :) its just not sure you can find it, but its garanteed you get shit on your hands if you try ;) so I stay away from $TSLA and stocks.
761 2018-08-25 11:48:07 Also, in all seriousness, I’m an index fund guy. Small amount of Tesla shares and if they went bankrupt I would be fine. I realize stocks are risky. I’m a fan of the cars obviously and have no clue where the stock will go.
762 2018-08-25 11:46:41 Should have talked to #Collins about some stocks

766 2018-08-25 11:44:23 Or the theory that this whole thing was to prevent a Saudi hostile takeover was true, they needed to tank the stocks after the Saudis bought the 5% quicky. Remember they were courting musk for 2 years, he always sent them away to go on open market, but they didnt until now.

791 2018-08-25 11:13:04 Market will tank because economic confidence will plummet, that’s the issue, it may not affect every individual on a disastrous level but when the value of stocks go down that company loses money therefore laying off workers, etc., to regain value
792 2018-08-25 11:12:47 I would rather lose money through stocks rather than lose it via scams. What's happening in the market recently is just a normal thing, stocks goes up and down because that's the behavior and nature of the market.

Public investors want the opportunity to ramp public shares on "story and hype" and sell into strength, cause dips, and repeat.  Volatility is where money is made, not private stocks.

818 2018-08-25 10:39:22 OK. Hmmm. I hardly think anybody should spend time on/in single stocks unless it's a hobby. Global stocks and commodities index investing is best för most. Right now, however stocks are historically very high [something] and thus unusually risky. I don't own public stocks.

831 2018-08-25 10:21:05 But they can't help at the store, as there's nothing on the system to say when stock will be arriving. I find it pretty poor that they don't stock them in store especially at this time of year. Even if it was just for the month as you are the only store that stocks their uniform.
832 2018-08-25 10:20:01 That was very impressive. Bump stocks much better than I thought.
833 2018-08-25 10:19:30 1. But where is financial part at all? 2. If you work with npv and descriptive statistics wich are good for fixed income, you really need luck in currencies and stocks. If you work with odds/probabilities with optimal bet sizing you have to work with Capital curve smoothing.

857 2018-08-25 09:41:27 Sinceramente el tema de los cortos nunca lo he entendido . Hay empresas que no paran de subir con unos niveles de cortos brutales . A no ser que les encante perder dinero .

913 2018-08-25 08:01:22 @moneyboxteam is it possible to have a Lifetime ISA and a Stocks and Shares ISA simultaneously? Are there any tax implications to having both? 

I'm considering closing my Help 2 Buy ISA and opening a LISA with you guys (alongside my existing Stocks & Shares ISA!)
914 2018-08-25 08:00:37 No one is holding any hands here. I do try to provide viable entry and exits on a small select name of stocks. I’d hope you take what I post and do your own due diligence.
Greatly appreciate Chaz, the Spx-killer!

916 2018-08-25 07:57:47 QT has been going on while stocks have risen. Still tiny borrowing rates. Stocks in uptrend. When not then sell.
917 2018-08-25 07:51:53 That can't be good news to show on CNN - Counterfeit News Network if the stocks are breaking records. It will be immediate breaking news when it slips.
918 2018-08-25 07:51:25 Short Strangle on Hexaware 

Sell 480 CE @ 1.45
      280 PE @ 1.45

Wait for the target of Zero at Expiry. Stop loss at 3 at either side.

Logic: It had lost 15 % on Friday. It may not move another10% either up or down in another 4 days.
919 2018-08-25 07:51:04 Sure it’ll be different areas of competition between Alphabet and Baidu

Though, Search is economically main foundation of both companies

Nobody cared when Waymo setup office in China. Meanwhile, rumors that Google search will be back in China significantly damaged Baidu stocks.

921 2018-08-25 07:47:38 OK, so which of your appointees owns Drug Companies? Do you have $stocks$ on any or perhaps $own$ any? That is the ONLY way that you would even mention drug companies. You deflect (turn everything around) & gaslight (tell people what to think). RESIGN OR YOU WILL BE IMPEACHED!
922 2018-08-25 07:46:29 Some body who is interested in positional trade can check stocks in weekly OHLC file and trade as he trades daily chart. Last week Reliance and Tatasteel trades that we took on Monday were based on weekly OHLC.

930 2018-08-25 07:38:32 Investments, TRUE investments are a log game. You wanna make a quick buck? Stay outta companies like @Tesla. You wanna retire like a king? Invest in @Tesla and watch your stocks grow. What’s the market price of @Tesla ATM? $320+? 5 years ago it was $127. Y’all do that math yo!
931 2018-08-25 07:38:28 @uglydrinks_uk disappointed  I won a voucher for free can of your drink and I can’t redeem it because I can’t find the store that stocks it! Literally visited like every local one and nothing! I was excited to try it too!

PS. Baidu stocks were deeply dropped, with first rumors about Google plans to adjust search engine for China

941 2018-08-25 07:20:57 It is not like Indians were barred from investing in bank stocks. RBI did not exactly encourage domestic mutual funds. It saw them as a threat to bank deposits. Barred liquid MFs from providing ATM withdrawal facility.

946 2018-08-25 07:14:45 Sell Kajaria Ceramics  510 CE @ 5 [ Target 1, Stop loss  8]

Logic: last 3 trading days, first day it had gap up opening and it built on it.
2 nd day, it had gap up  and it sustained.
3 rd day gap up but it lost all the gains ended - ive. It may not go up to 510  before expiry.

951 2018-08-25 07:10:56 just a money grubbing wheeler dealer, making a killing on stocks and shares, not caring about whether the country gets a deal or what happens to our jobs. Like you, he's in it for himself. No guts to stand as leader, just sneakily stabbing  PM in back.
952 2018-08-25 07:09:06 Going forward i will focus only on IT & PHARMA Stocks ... As i feel these 2 sectors are going to outperfom More from here ..
953 2018-08-25 07:08:01 I'm not opposed to *a* right to buy, but it would need to be carefully designed to insure it acted as a conveyor of re-investment and not a gift to rent seeking spivs or a source of revenue for other government departments. It'd also need to wait until social housing stocks...
954 2018-08-25 07:07:49 Long at the mo, but I seem to be able to spot tops better. and one thing I have learnt is not to short low float stocks with volumeIm at the point where I know loads of patterns and how to spot them,its just analyzing how I execute them as to what I do wrong.Then I'll go short

968 2018-08-25 06:52:15 There are about 80 stocks in the NSE market that do an average of more than 100 cr turnover per day.

Assuming even 20% delivery a small fund of say 1000 crore if wants to offload his 2% stake in any of these non 80 stocks, he cannot do so without crashing the stock

976 2018-08-25 06:41:50 Totally agree with you sir, the key to surviving indeed is position sizing. For stocks, I ensure that the max loss on a position in any underlying is less than even 5% of my total capital and that includes strategies like short straddles (cap them with covers).
977 2018-08-25 06:40:59 Lol... European stocks have lagged for a while and multiples are compressed. Growth is anemic. Politics is just a short term issue. Italy needs strong reformes to attract capital.

981 2018-08-25 06:39:46 Not all stocks play by the same rules... to day trade a stock, first look at the multi day trade and go with it.  Then see what it “likes” to do in respect to range ... “are double tops it’s thing??”  “Are double bottoms it’s thing?”  #AUS
982 2018-08-25 06:39:02 The problem is to identify those great 10 stocks and hold them with high conviction and patience for very long time.
983 2018-08-25 06:37:51 If any of y'all chartists have not looked into stock options, it does not make sense to me. The risk v. reward is unreal. My play has been picking obvious patterns or movements and playing them and moving on to the next stock. It feels like there are far less chartists in stocks.
984 2018-08-25 06:37:25 * pre-positioning * stocks in order to “ front load “ an operation which is just starting, while the supply chain is running up to full speed. The govt doesn’t understand logistics at all.
985 2018-08-25 06:35:10 Note this, Bill. There are limits on the First Amendment just as there are limits on the 2nd. Defamation, for instance is not protected. so taking Alex Jones down is a little like saying all right guns are legal but you can't have bump stocks.

990 2018-08-25 06:31:10 This is the myth of stockpiling. Firstly, this isn’t a stockpile, it’s a buffer stock. Buffer stocks are used to cover gaps in supply chains. Once you start using a buffer stock, then you must replenish it the moment your supply comes back online. Which means your supply chain 1/

1030 2018-08-25 05:44:09 The basic ideas of investing are to look at stocks as businesses,

use market fluctuations to your advantage, and seek a margin
of safety.

That’s what Ben Graham taught us. A hundred years
from now they will still be the cornerstones of investing.

1066 2018-08-25 05:10:49 Elon Musk took LSD and tweeted that he was going to take Tesla private when stocks hit $420/share. This was a criminal act and caused all kinds of problems. Also, Azealia Banks was present, something to do with collaborating with Grimes, who was either not there or IDK.

1091 2018-08-25 04:45:41 Sounds reasonable.  From an outsider's perspective, I don't hear much about disarming....I'm sure that would be political suicide.  But it's so strange to see the lack of movement on such obvious issues, like universal background checks, banning bump stocks, etc.
1092 2018-08-25 04:45:35 @Karl___Marx you do realize this company is worth more than GM right? Why is that? Because stocks are forward looking

How are your stocks doing? I ask because I divested based on the scare tactics by the media. Though I took all of that $ to real estate so still fine in the long run.

1. Rich Dad, poor Dad.. important to understand money. 
2. Common stocks, Uncommon profits
3. One up on Wall Street.
4. Intelligent investor (this can get really boring for some).
5. Security Analysis..!!

Understanding and implementing them is more important.
1097 2018-08-25 04:42:40 That is like saying, since smaller tech stocks fall when the giants fall that the smaller tech stocks have no value. That is completely ignorant. This is the cryptocurrency sector and the basics still apply. When the majors move, the little ones will follow.

1109 2018-08-25 04:28:56 Aye, <1 day for true day trading (I'd classify as scalping fo sho). Short term for crypto is 30 days or less. Stocks get a multiplier of like 3 or something.

1118 2018-08-25 04:20:24 Most think it was Obama that caused the economy to improve w/bailouts & QE. The Republicsns fought him every second & they said the only reason the stock market is improving is because he is printing $.Sure Trump's unfair tax cuts help stocks but raises debt dramatically.

Got to invest around 10-20% of the income to good stocks (the ones that has good leadership). 10% for savings (cash). 10-20% put aside for other future investments (business would be the best, the channel is a business)

1160 2018-08-25 03:35:57 Now is a good time to invest in straw stocks because people are going to stockpile them.
1161 2018-08-25 03:35:53 if Tesla had a crypto coin it would be soaring right now. benefit of a 24/7 market. too bad stocks are still stuck in the old paradigm.
1162 2018-08-25 03:34:48 It’s because your church owns billions in pharma stocks. It’s all about money.
1163 2018-08-25 03:32:35 EXACTLY!his dumbass comment that stocks would fall +everyone will be poor,Most Americans don't have stocks+And most haven't seen no change anyway,If he's impeached,chances are PENCE might wise up an roll back TRUMPS stupidity,End Tarriffs and get our respect+honor back!IMPEACH!
1164 2018-08-25 03:32:05 The Dow measures the value of stocks owned mostly by the 1%, who enjoy almost all stock dividends and huge capital-gains tax breaks. Wages haven't risen at all. So now there are more wage slaves? Oh boy! MAPA.
1165 2018-08-25 03:31:54 Is it pyramiding or any diff strategy for blue chip low beta stocks? Is it ok to increase lot size once you are in profit?

1169 2018-08-25 03:29:37 The underlying asset is owned by an actual legal holder. Technically, whatever happens on secondary markers is none of the issuer's business  as they are bearer bonds. What happens if an armed car full of bearer deeds, bonds, stocks, etc gets robbed?

Just protocol stewardship.

1174 2018-08-25 03:23:54 Except a pedophile is one person that is responsible for their actions. SeaWorld is a company. Many people are responsible for its actions and many of those people have changed over the years. 

Except the numbers say otherwise and their stocks are climbing.
1175 2018-08-25 03:21:07 Fiscal Conservatism. Not blowing a $13 billion dollar surplus in 2 years, Not selling Stocks to make it appear as a surplus. Harper was a HOPELESS fiscal Conservative.Mulroney wasn't much better, but he had something to show for the debt. Harper was arrogant,financial nightmare.
1176 2018-08-25 03:20:17 Stocks and 35's?
1177 2018-08-25 03:20:00 The data is glaring. How many mass shootings before or after.  The rifles during the ban were far less tactical. No stocks, no muzzle, no attachments.

1190 2018-08-25 03:12:26 Be comforted. Stocks have been on the rise—despite trump and his travesties.
1191 2018-08-25 03:12:20 I like all asset classes, gold has it's play when the eventual currency crisis hits. Timing is difficult. Don't have to be a permabear to see value in gold. Don't have to hate stocks if you like gold, and vice versa. It's not either or, it's both.
1192 2018-08-25 03:11:57 bump stocks allow for the most rapid fire
1193 2018-08-25 03:11:52 This is the reasoning behind the Republican Tax Cuts. Give the rich more. But the rich don't stimulate the economy. Give a wealthy family $1000 tax cut and they buy stocks. A struggling family would buy items, gasoline, necessities. GOP makes bad economic decisions.
1194 2018-08-25 03:10:26 just generally speaking the antics of the mortor and pick fandom will just unfailingly lose against those two ppl tht tweeted “buy elon’s stocks to support him” when he sadtweeted on main. like tht completely bulged my eyes out at the late capitalist dystopia of it all

1200 2018-08-25 03:06:17 $TSLA shorts aren't 100% wrong. problems is, buying #coal stocks would make an easier / less stressful trade -- easier to make capital via compounding / being long vs. shorting in a bull market w/ low rates.

1213 2018-08-25 02:56:15 I’m liking the Canadian pot stocks. Getting hi. Hello friend.
1214 2018-08-25 02:56:15 Having said that, it’s s good time to spend a little money to invest in marijuana stocks, and CBD oil. 
1215 2018-08-25 02:55:31 It was rumoured that one stock with Energy as its middle name ran up before UP elections to gather funds for a party. Collapsed later.

The strategy may have correlation to stocks in your tweet.
1216 2018-08-25 02:55:01 Background checks on every gun purchase; ban military weapons; ban bump stocks; that insane wackjob in Las Vegas was allowed to buy dozens of guns in just a few months and no one batted an eye; maybe bring back militias if you want to buy a gun like it says in the 2nd amendment.
1217 2018-08-25 02:54:55 Another hit ... #Retail #Catamaran #Manafortverdict & a case of @PinkNotorious Talking stocks on a boat. Glam Glow gets a bump
1218 2018-08-25 02:54:09 I already do what all they have said & moreover, 60% of my funds have no rankings or stars. I simply pick the funds based on the stocks I want to invest. I have been doing this for the last 10 years. So, nothing new for me.
I like investing through AMC's/Banks Only. No 3rd party.
1219 2018-08-25 02:53:49 Just let me know ahead of time. I'll by more stocks in coffins and urns
1220 2018-08-25 02:49:36 Bueno, se obvia que Melee son 4 stocks.
Acaso hay otra manera de jugar?
Obviamente 4 stocks con 8 minutos.
El perdedor tiene que comprarle un raulito al ganador.
1221 2018-08-25 02:49:34 1/4 $SMH $MDY $IWM As I go into the weekend, the only negative thing I can find in the way stocks are trading is...the absence of anything negative. Things just look good, despite a brutal news flow out of DC. The markets don’t care about the things that dominate the news.
1222 2018-08-25 02:49:30 ANOTHER WHAT?? Anyone can complain about anything! It takes A REAL MAN TO TELL THE TRUTH 
1223 2018-08-25 02:48:26 You are talking about #fintech  your #paymentgateway #payu has only 1% sucess rate and 99% failure rate when trying to use ur #virtual #rupay #card for any #Online #transactions #YesBank #nse #bse #NIFTY #UK #banknifty #LondonStockExchange #stockstowatch #Stocks_in #StockMarket
1224 2018-08-25 02:48:12 You either stay or run. I'm too old to run. Say, just how many bump stocks have been turned in?

The answer in non compliance, and eventually the Trump scotus.

If not, things get ugly.
1225 2018-08-25 02:47:25 LOL  yes.. a little bit will go a long way with him.
1226 2018-08-25 02:46:26 @CMOKerala please announce how much funds have you received overall from #GOI , donations from all #Indians , food stocks , medicines all aid received. have you spent even half of funds and aid received ? why do you need more money immediately? Why ask foreign countrys help?
1227 2018-08-25 02:46:10 Question:  if the economy, and especially the consumer, are as strong as we think - why are housing stocks and auto stocks so horribly weak -- all year?  Anyone?
1228 2018-08-25 02:45:40 He needs all the help he can get. gotta wax them eye brows brah
1229 2018-08-25 02:45:27 Trump supporter like the kkk?  Didn’t they just have a big protest all 12 of them?  Ya ya big revolt!! The only reasons the stocks would fall if trump was impeached is if it was manipulated by the trump stock brokers. Cuz if was impeached we could go back into UN and undo tariffs
1230 2018-08-25 02:42:04 U the homie springer keep checking them stocks.
1231 2018-08-25 02:41:54 I don't believe the part about how the money is being used.  Its being used to buy back stocks and enrich the rich. It will not trickle down.
1232 2018-08-25 02:40:36 man you’re right! everyone should be 100% liberal or 100% conservative! way to label & sterotype!!:) sorry, which RT were you mad about? the first female US navy commander? or banning bump stocks, pushing mental health background checks, & raising the age to 21 to own a gun?
1233 2018-08-25 02:40:28 One must understand the difference between low priced stock & undervalued stock.
Many people believed 52 weeks low means undervalued stocks,not always right, in fact many undervalued stocks can also be in 52 weeks high.

1239 2018-08-25 02:35:52 Great video, I voted for Trump & I'll vote for him in 2020.  Stocks are up at all time highs, he is killing stupid regs on businesses large & small, jobs are coming back & much more. He has given us in Military hope again too! The man is getting things done fast. Whats to hate?
1240 2018-08-25 02:33:45 Virtue signaling is a major industry in Hollywood. You must make confession and then do public penance for being white. Wouldn’t just be simpler to be put in stocks and have rotten garbage tossed? And more fun.

1249 2018-08-25 02:28:08 Some of us actually own stocks in South Africa Turkey Russia Philippines and Brazil. So we know first hand how scatterbrained @TeamTrump is. What is the end game, neocon globalist domination? So what was wrong with Rubio or Cruz.
1250 2018-08-25 02:28:05 Are y’all trading stocks?
1251 2018-08-25 02:26:36 As soon as I have a portfolio of winning leaders, I tune out all the NOISE including building a watchlist. I just completely stop watching other stocks. It's a necessary part of my process to protect myself from my inner child wanting to eat all the candies.
1252 2018-08-25 02:26:25 You’re missing the point. Gold has sucked for seven long years, and still all gold bugs say is “stocks will all come crashing down”, missing the huge gains in stocks. I’ll keep booking my gains & get out when the trend changes. Many won’t, just like 2000-02 & 2007-09.

I feel ya though.
1257 2018-08-25 02:23:23 Can’t argue with 149% but that number was skewed a bit by tech stocks. Besides all I hear from the left now is Wall St is evil and doesn’t help Main St. I guess those must be some of those rose colored glasses you mentioned.
1258 2018-08-25 02:20:57 Data N Crypto to me-is not significant enough 2 make a math & or charting prediction-This is more of a psychological thing. Currently most of us trading are experienced day traders (stocks)  and that in itself is part of the problem. Our charts work in a bull market only here. ??
1259 2018-08-25 02:20:19 Just looked through your feed. You pumping $CELZ? LOL I checked the filings & $CELZ doesn't touch $RBIZ fundamentally. You people don't want to beef with me. I will shit on your stocks. None of them down here are comparable to $RBIZ fundamentally, FACTS.

1271 2018-08-25 02:07:21 And Stephen Paddock's killing spree which left 58 dead & 400+ injured proves Congress needs to reinstate the assault weapons ban, AND ban bump stocks. And they also need to stop letting white men stockpile weapons.  Fuck the NRA.
1272 2018-08-25 02:05:27 Yup, that and just stay in my lane. That's the easiest way cuz I can still make money here, there, stocks... wherever GANN and ichi can be used hahaha

1275 2018-08-25 02:02:52 That was quite the epic implosion - same with Blackberry at its peak.
We've had some big runs - and then plummets - in Canadian stocks.
1276 2018-08-25 02:02:36 Way to roll with what you’re given!  My have to slow the pace a bit with the street stocks. 
1277 2018-08-25 02:00:05 with stocks in case of reducing production due to increased turbidity. Thank you.
1278 2018-08-25 01:59:40 Wrong. There are bump stocks that increase fire to automatic and there are also simple plans on the internet to convert them. 500+ injured, 59 dead, all AR-15 with bump stocks. Unrestricted access to military grade weaponry is what is killing people.
1279 2018-08-25 01:59:14 Bud i do a avatar cause im not on here for fame . Im here for fun Good luck bud . Get a girl or something bro. Do something with urself.

1285 2018-08-25 01:56:19 Thought it was a little weird you were announcing street stocks! How rude for the local announcer to just not show up.
1286 2018-08-25 01:54:39 Es en serio? Economia planificada no es economia 1 a 1 Manejas stocks tambien, se exportan exedentes a otros paises y se les compra faltantes. 
Y el exceso de oferta o de demanda no tiene la importancia economica que le das, por que los productos no tienen un precio.
1287 2018-08-25 01:52:00 Yes but only something like 35-40 of the country owns stocks. Why rely on trickle down when we know it doesn’t actually work?
1288 2018-08-25 01:51:51 Ye ok, have fun losing money on $HMNY and $XRP, hiding behind a logo and hiding your actual win/los percentage...whatever helps you feel better about yourself snowflake...you can have the last word since you so desperately need it for your self esteem...have at it bud!
1289 2018-08-25 01:51:42 Thanks bro! I’m trying to do my best..
1290 2018-08-25 01:50:56 time to start dipping toe(s) into automotive stocks -- $F $GM $HMC $TM -- lots of value out there -- a business like Honda should never be at 7.0x EV/Ebitda
1291 2018-08-25 01:50:11 be modified with after market stocks and grips and can be made to look very similar to an AR-15. Besides a lot of other hunting rifles have bigger calibers and can do way more damage than the AR-15. A military assault rifle is completely different, they can be single fire, burst
1292 2018-08-25 01:49:56 assault weapon. It simply has a "tactical" look and that's it. It's semi-automatic like the majority of guns are, one trigger pull = one bullet. There are stock hunting rifles with wood stocks and grips that most are ok with because they are hunting rifles. But a lot of them can
1293 2018-08-25 01:49:42 Hey Will , I'm very interested in learning options instead of stocks. Is there a reading list you can give me?
1294 2018-08-25 01:49:37 same reaction as a quick 5 stocks and each stock is actually intense lol
1295 2018-08-25 01:49:11 Sure. Like Your thinking. The @ASX has an onus to ensure stocks trade. Also they recieve profits from trade. So Recompliance & resuming trading would be a priority.
1296 2018-08-25 01:49:08 Maybe we can retire early....lol
1297 2018-08-25 01:48:38 Donnie, you made my life so simple since you became president. When you say CNN is fake, I watch CNN. When you say the stock will crash, I buy stocks. When you say mother in laws is monster, I kiss my mother in law. Thank you again, Mr. Lying Projection in Motion.
1298 2018-08-25 01:47:28 I remember before instagram was popular how the celebrities use to ACTUALLY tweet and from their own account. Now they just be on IG sharing the post to twitter. I bet many of them got stocks and don’t even use be product.
1299 2018-08-25 01:46:58 How many Pharma stocks do you own?
1300 2018-08-25 01:46:39 Ryan took 6 stocks he's a fkn legend
1301 2018-08-25 01:44:40 Just how many bump stocks have been turned in?

Expect the same degree of compliance if this passes.
1302 2018-08-25 01:44:39 lol. Look into my profile you will see the gains over the years. Ur just bored. and i must be beautiful cause my girl is and so is my life 
1303 2018-08-25 01:43:58 The year is 3019... the last remaining human on earth is dying... stocks still rallying...
1304 2018-08-25 01:43:45 For an IRA if you have more than 5 years until retirement, you should own some stocks (or stock funds) in addition to super safe investments like cash (money mkts) and CDs. Both of the options you listed are so safe that you won’t make much of a return. Thx for hitting us up!

#theinvestmentchallenge
1310 2018-08-25 01:37:16 The $$$ from @HillaryClinton's 2016 campaign buying  fake information dossier from disgraced former British spy, @johnpodesta's @jouleunlimited $75K in stocks, @BarackObama's, "I'll have more flexibility after the election."
1311 2018-08-25 01:36:57 Lol like stocks would shoot up and their would be partying in the streets..
1312 2018-08-25 01:36:29 I really wish i was smart enough to understand investing in stocks i really wanna do that
1313 2018-08-25 01:36:03 You're right. I've been thinking of getting a couple of Amazon stocks tho..
1314 2018-08-25 01:36:02 Stephen bought nearly 50 guns in 5 different states since 1982 and bought tracer ammo illegally. Stephen used bump stocks to increase the firerate of his guns(which the NRA actually agreed with regulating). There's still no motive in the case, which itself is hazy as fuck.
1315 2018-08-25 01:35:45 Wait. Why don’t you short casino stocks when the economy collapses. Bad economy = less disposable income to waste and gamble
1316 2018-08-25 01:34:45 Quite frankly the system doesn’t care if it’s a “bull market” or “bear market” long strong stocks above 200 day, sell call spreads on those below. At all times.
1317 2018-08-25 01:33:45 People want to buy mangoes for the price of bananas in the stock market. A certain mindset chases the beaten down names and only a few buy quality businesses. Enhancing one's perception is one the most important thing in investing before one starts buying stocks.
1318 2018-08-25 01:33:29 I was looking for some fundamentally strong and weak stocks.
1319 2018-08-25 01:33:07 Specifically apple stocks going dumb crazy in September
1320 2018-08-25 01:31:29 When gold starts moving higher for real 
Everyone will come up with great new reasons to buy gold mining stocks
1321 2018-08-25 01:31:07 Looking at all the stocks I thought about investing in two years ago and seeing how much they’ve risen in price since then 
1322 2018-08-25 01:29:34 Stocks MOST reliant on a strong economy; casinos, hotels, carmakers, housing etc...
1323 2018-08-25 01:28:11 A lot of people don't buy stocks as they think they will lose all their money.
1324 2018-08-25 01:27:57 Or invest smartly in stocks
1325 2018-08-25 01:27:36 PULL OUT THE AMD STOCKS

1329 2018-08-25 01:24:10 My hardrive broke on the PlayStation so we spent 100$ to replace it and they put in what that was worse... so my dad was pissed he just spent 100$ for nothing and said he was dropping stocks in Sony and he was trading in the PlayStation for the Xbox under the comment box looool
1330 2018-08-25 01:22:23 What stocks do you want to short at the end of the bull market and buy at the end of the bear market?
1331 2018-08-25 01:20:19 It won't happen in fact the stocks may even bounce. The stock market doesnt care who the President is, it's not that sentimental.
1332 2018-08-25 01:19:22 There are so many positive things about Amazon that I have never experienced at any other job I’ve worked, and Jeff (the founder) has an annual salary of about 80k. Most of his net worth comes from his stocks, which he can’t even sell because he would lose money lol
1333 2018-08-25 01:18:24 The strory is more or less same in all service industry be it insurance / bank / telecome. The real requirement is of tight regulatory vigil & transparency. The real danger is this inflated stock market where lots of money chasing few stocks giving a wrong narrative.
1334 2018-08-25 01:18:22 Oh yea? Where do you publish your trades/outcomes? By the way, show us that beatificó face of yours and quit hiding behind that shitty logo! Since you like to criticize appearances...you must be gorgeous!

It’s so fun to poke at you because you’re so easily triggered.
1335 2018-08-25 01:15:22 Weinstein taking on the NRA = @CatholicBishops divesting oil stocks. Guessing it will work about as well....
1336 2018-08-25 01:14:53 Until the toxic stocks start getting sold off by scam artists. Watch out for the healthcare bubble.
1337 2018-08-25 01:13:34 52 people would be alive and many more not maimed if bump stocks were illegal.
Still waiting on this one the president said he would personally take care of

1373 2018-08-25 00:54:35 1) I see the point about keeping content out of a game for preordering. But I also see why they do it. From a business perspective, preorders are almost guaranteed cash for a company. The more preorders, the more stocks go up (but not all gaming companies are publicly traded)

1391 2018-08-25 00:45:18 Funny, when the doom and Gloomers appear, the Dow makes a fool of them. Even the worst correction returned a Dow upward frenzy. I don’t see the Hedge Funds selling, I see them sitting on cash, ready to buy stocks with any correction. They make their money buying when others sell.
1392 2018-08-25 00:45:06 I had a top analyst at a huge investment bank reach out the day before the $weed news and tell me to be careful owning any pot stocks, blah,blah, blah... no one knows. You have to have a plan and stick to it. Adapt to market conditions.

1417 2018-08-25 00:26:40 Why don’t you tell ppl in the United States that cause of you foreign investor are running away from investing in US Companies and stocks. Wait for it. Republicans love money. See who is going to pay the debt. @ABC @CBSNews @FoxNews @NBCNews @MSNBC @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @DNC
1418 2018-08-25 00:26:08 Damn ur well informed. So, erratic by your description has proven effective? If @realDonaldTrump’s fans like him because he’s doing something “different” and prior results were bad, why would y’all wanna continue with same erratic stuff? Are you all shorting the same stocks?
1419 2018-08-25 00:24:32 Then the fbi bull dozed the entire area WTF!!

1427 2018-08-25 00:17:40 I completely understand. I was a little curious about the operating system you have been using. Is it a specific trading software or is it more of a scanner? I've been trying to learn how to identify stocks to potentially buy into.

Many work3 & 4 jobs to just make ends meet while the corps that you give huge tax breaks to R making billions trickle down economics doesn't work they reinvest the money in their own stocks artificially inflating the value
1429 2018-08-25 00:15:48 So he's an idiot now he's a genius manipulating stock markets with tweets that have nothing to do with stocks?  Right.  You keep suggesting that other peoples personal finance violations reflect on others?  Then should all the fired senior DOJ and FBI officials reflect on dems?

1439 2018-08-25 00:08:56 I honestly don’t have a handle on these valuation multiples for amazon, Netflix, shopify, etc. In a recessionary environment (which I contend will come around October or November of next year, based on the current trajectory of the yield curve), these stocks will be toast
1440 2018-08-25 00:08:47 Oh, like @RepDuncanHunter and the other guy - who steal campaign funds and trade stocks illegally? Those ethical republicans? 
1441 2018-08-25 00:08:45 So glad I at home....lol
1442 2018-08-25 00:06:44 Trump is stupid? 4.1% GDP, 4M new jobs created, stocks up 40%, illegal border crossings down 74%, 3.9M people off welfare, $9 trillion added to the economy, etc., etc., etc. . . .  I’m sure Barack’s lackey Crooked Hillary would have done much better by now.  Said no one, ever.

1466 2018-08-26 23:47:18 I agree that bump stocks should be illegal. I think it's also easy to make an AR15 fire faster without a bump stock (I don't understand it but apparently it's not hard) and that also must be addressed. I totally agree. No civilian needs to fire more than 1 round per second.

1506 2018-08-26 23:29:06 Perot was the last guy to propose a flat tax; the idea fails when you get to people earning money from stocks and other “unearned income” tax is WAY too complicated for that. Just ask my wife...

1508 2018-08-26 23:27:59 Lol you destroy your own tweet here. Using the word "recovery" so you admit Obama fixed a destroyed economy. What does weakest recovery mean? Stocks went from 7k to 19k. Thats weak? You have had no accomplishments. Trying to ignore shooting in FL today too? Not one word from you.
1509 2018-08-26 23:27:55 It great over here since Trump because Potus my stocks have tripled and I finally made my first million Justin Trudeau is the son of a communist leader and ur socialist medical health care Sucks
1510 2018-08-26 23:27:28 This tweet from him, shows how small his mind is! Also, it shows he knows less than Zero about business, economics, and marketing! Pres Obama took us from brink of bankruptcy to flourishing in 8 years. Trump gave rich billions to buy back stocks #Idiot45
1511 2018-08-26 23:27:17 Yet most economists agree your impending impeachment would make stocks soar.
1512 2018-08-26 23:27:11 Do I really have to dig into my own feed and repost? Sigh. OK. Ban bump stocks. Past red flag laws. Background checks. Take away guns from domestic abusers. Need more?

1517 2018-08-26 23:23:34 Shut the fuck up you moron. Maybe certain sectors are up. Your policies have ruined others. Stocks I've owned since 2007 plummeted when you took office you fucktard. Averaged 100 to a 150 percent per year tell your dumbass took office. Now down and stagnant. You suck ass
1518 2018-08-26 23:23:29 We want 

No assault type weapons

No bump stocks (make illegal)

Close the gun show loophole

This does not include hunting rifles or personal protection, hence 2A is fine

 who needs a military type weapon that shoots multiple rounds anyways?
1519 2018-08-26 23:22:09 Found bottom?? I would have thought the $48.60 paid by Constellation would be a kind of bench mark. Usually, the stocks have passed a milestone ($50/sh) and then regressed for a while. That’s what spooked me into selling. But it didn’t happen this time.

1526 2018-08-26 23:16:07 Imagine not buying the top internet company stocks during the dot com crash of '99 and the crash of '08 that followed.

The greatest stock market bull run in history only followed immediately after.

No big deal, right? 
1527 2018-08-26 23:15:31 i'm tempted to buy the mood light on d-day if there are still stocks left... but 3500... but...
1528 2018-08-26 23:14:43 GDP doesn't need to be anywhere close to those targets for stocks to move materially higher.  I agree with you.  The bear camp is overflowing.

There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。
1532 2018-08-26 23:12:10 Stocks plunged as E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company unveiled a fiery harmonica today.
1533 2018-08-26 23:11:21 My cousin took her time to teach me about stocks today  I swear this the type of stuff I love to talk about, I can’t wait to buy my first stock 
1534 2018-08-26 23:11:17 Third point. President Trump said he was going to sign an exec order to ban bump stocks. Idk if he did or not but besides that the only other devices I can think of that make a weapon act automatic is a sere and those probably should be a little harder to get.
1535 2018-08-26 23:10:37 Well, the point of banning murder is making murder illegal, which I would say it's pretty effective at doing, but the point of say banning bump stocks is reducing gun homicide, which it has not been proven to be effective at doing.
1536 2018-08-26 23:10:21 Obama saved us from another depression caused in part by Republican policies. Stocks more than doubled, new jobs steadily exceeded your monthly average, and growth exceeded 4.1% four times. 

And he wasn’t a treasonous, corrupt mob boss.
1537 2018-08-26 23:08:44 This is AWFULL!! It’s like overseein’ 8 years of massive economic growth, a triplin’ of the stocks market, massive reductions in unemploymint and then havin’ a new president immediateley claim the good economey is cuz of him! U must be so ANNOYED, sir! #TrumpLogic
1538 2018-08-26 23:07:23 And remember mid 2015 to mid 2016 was a pretty brutal. S&P 500 -15% (Median stock -25%, nearly 80% of S&P 500 stocks were below their 200-day moving average.) Russell 2000 -27%

Also I hope they will venture to more business but I think that's too much for them to handle? Like instead of VT/Line cafe/other endorsements they will have their own cafe, skincare line  fashion line etc

1544 2018-08-26 22:59:02 Reality is this will do nothing. Bump stocks, ar15 age I can see. However most of whom I arrested in 20 years have stolen weapons, or weapons that have came into our country illegally thru the border, which happens more than most realize.
1545 2018-08-26 22:58:32 You can disregard a 97 NPS and short the stock if you wish.  That is your right.  But there’s a great big world of stocks out there you could be shorting, literally all of which have customers who don’t love them as much as Tesla owners love Tesla.

1556 2018-08-26 22:49:24 I cannot say. Nor can you say that a particular gun law would not have stopped the killer. But, if you were asking what gun reforms I support, they are: universal background checks on all gun sales/transfers, a ban on assault weapons & bump stocks, safe storage laws. Thx.
1557 2018-08-26 22:49:05 @realDonaldTrump  will never ban BUMP STOCKS as promised cuz
TRUMP FEARS THE NRA!!

1559 2018-08-26 22:46:05 @CBSThisMorning 
If President Trump is so bad WHY. Higher stocks market. Tax credit you took. Low employment. Still get health care lower then Obama care. Higher wages
 Bad President ?????
1560 2018-08-26 22:45:18 $nflx already had major move. Top bol is now resistance on daily. The rest of fang $fb $amzn $googl all look ready for major move.

1561 2018-08-26 22:44:34 @sainsburys hi, can you tell me if your Leeds Colton store stocks the new no dough pizza co. Pizzas?
1562 2018-08-26 22:44:22 I agree with the bump stocks and stronger checks but many want to eliminate guns all together. What better way to make citizens unable to defend against a coup. They want to disarm like Europe to further globalist agenda like Hitler did to Germany.
1563 2018-08-26 22:44:17 So for someone looking to participate in the gains without micromanaging his portfolio, HMMJ would be a fairly safe alternative to individual stocks. I’ve done well on the stocks, but getting spooked on this last run has made me rethink my position.

1565 2018-08-26 22:43:08 And frankly I HIGHLY DOUBT banning bump stocks would affect semi autos or light triggers if anyone with half a f'king brain knows how to write a law.
1566 2018-08-26 22:41:33 Trump u cant lie when we have facts..your followers cant read or write...let alone invest in stocks
1567 2018-08-26 22:40:59 What you don‘t realize is that nobody wants to take guns away from normal citizen, besides bump stocks, plus thorough backround and mentl health checks. I bet this guy was nit mentally stable and should‘ve never owned a gun. If you‘re not crazy why being against stricter rules?
1568 2018-08-26 22:39:43 He could have done the same amount of damage if he didn’t have bump stocks, it just made it easier to do. The problem with banning them, is it could cause other things like lighter triggers or semi automatic action being banned because of the wording of the law.

1572 2018-08-26 22:35:43 The economy has no direct correlation to the tax cuts, perhaps the corporate buy back has something to do with the uptick on the market. Lord knows it not you and me buying those massive amounts of overpriced stocks
1573 2018-08-26 22:35:38 Sure, stocks up 254% under Obama, unemployment from over 10% to almost 4%, more jobs created than Trump during same period of presidency. That is HISTORY, not re-written.

1583 2018-08-26 22:29:22 that isn’t a trump thing. mass shootings have been a problem in america way before trump. in fact, trunp banned bump stocks, which is more then any politician has in years
1584 2018-08-26 22:28:18 Especially since half of America doesn't own any stocks!
1585 2018-08-26 22:27:13 It’s time for me to get into stocks lol
1586 2018-08-26 22:26:52 You must pick the wrong stocks then.  The stock market is up 300% for the last 9 years.  I'm probably upper lower class and I have stocks and mutual funds and a 401k and my portfolio is thru the roof!  I love what President Trump has done.   It just keeps going higher and higher.
1587 2018-08-26 22:26:19 There weren’t good conversation between China and USA so I expect more downside until the trade wars ends . And I think it will take a little bit longer . I want to buy many of these Chinese stocks but won’t do it until the trade war ends .

1589 2018-08-26 22:25:02 私たちの株式投資への意欲をなくさせるような要因がかなりある。
There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. (131)
1590 2018-08-26 22:24:09 I'm with you.  Obama's 8 years were the most profitable of my adult life.  Contrary to Trump's continuous chest thumping things have actually cooled down dramatically in my occupation.  And yes,  the top 10% own 90% of all stocks.
1591 2018-08-26 22:23:45 Quiero esperar a ER . En $YEXT Solo le voy sacando un +5% porque empecé comprando a 23,3 pero también algo más al alza . En $ZUO empecé a comprar el jueves y ya tengo colchón del 10%. Así que tengo algo de colchón y esperaré a ER .
1592 2018-08-26 22:23:43 Hate seeing the same people, pumping the same stocks everyday and blaming everything on shorts. Shorts aren’t gonna get burned and there will be no short squeeze so stop.
1593 2018-08-26 22:23:22 Quarterly stocks the end of September will show where it's at, if you believe in that sort of thing.
1594 2018-08-26 22:23:21 Well, if you're losing in this bull market there is only one person to blame. You! If you can't figure out which stocks to pick then that's your fault. And if you're paying someone else to manage your portfolio. Time to take control of it bc you're missing out. BIGLY
1595 2018-08-26 22:21:08 "Not a week goes by when someone doesn’t appear and make one or both of these comments. “We are late in the cycle” and “stocks are expensive”. The statements are made as a matter of fact and no one seems to challenge them." Fear & Greed Trader
1596 2018-08-26 22:20:42 Aye Donald dumbass. You inherited a better economy them Obama. Obama got the US out of a recession. He gave you a good starting point while he was throw a curveball. Stop bragging about something you had no effect on. Stocks were rising before you were in office.
1597 2018-08-26 22:20:13 Matador how is your shitty job in finance going? Why do you only hold stocks that the 3 amigos hold? Hold on wait could it also be the 4th multi id account here??? Fast forward to hell you moron
1598 2018-08-26 22:19:16 Bros (or lady bros) into stocks and EPP: my employer is launching EPP in Q1 2019. Should I jump on that assuming it’s a solid discount (last employer was 20% off)? Seems fairly low risk considering our standing.
1599 2018-08-26 22:18:56 It's worse than that. He is hurting the economy, and they don't see that either. Rate of change under Obama was better for unemployment, stocks, debt, just about anything, except tax cuts for the rich.
1600 2018-08-26 22:18:50 The entire market looks so overbought. Tech stocks in particular. Facebook was a harbinger of things to come. S&P forming a rising wedge which has potential to form double top. If we don't see a MAJOR pullback in the next few months I'll be very surprised.
1601 2018-08-26 22:17:32 Because there are ignorant old white men in congress that think banning AR-15's and bump stocks and extensive background checks is taking their guns away and violating their 2nd amendment right
1602 2018-08-26 22:17:28 You mean lower taxes for corporations.  Buy back of stocks for CEO bonuses. Wages are dropping but profits are rising.
1603 2018-08-26 22:16:13 Keep seeing about stocks or
1604 2018-08-26 22:14:35 Love Commando also, especially the scene where he stocks up on weapons in the hidden backroom... #stickaround
1605 2018-08-26 22:14:33 I believe the majority does not want them all banned. Just common sense laws like no armor piercing bullets, no semi-automatics, bump stocks, unlimited amount of guns. It's naive to think we can change a culture, thought that would be the ideal long term solution.
1606 2018-08-26 22:12:48 Not sure what numbers they are looking at... but they are clearly incorrect.

Who even said this? I'd like to read article... guessing it's an opinion piece, not factual.

Only thing better is stocks, cus corps are buying them back at unprecedented rate.

Fake market results.
1607 2018-08-26 22:11:02 Stocks nearly tripled under Obama,  you petty little excuse of a president. How about just shutting the f**k up just one day while the country mourns McCain and yet another mass shooting.
1608 2018-08-26 22:10:08 No. Thoughts are not enough.

Neither are words. Don't know what was used as a weapon, but @realDonaldTrump said he be willing to ban bump stocks - how f'ing long ago now? The previous tragedy in Florida?

1618 2018-08-26 22:01:22 Those 58 people killed by white American male and American citizen, paddock,  in Las Vegas, would also be alive if bump stocks had been banned. Also, you suck.
1619 2018-08-26 22:00:05 Amen, about time to hold members of Congress accountable for their investments/stocks to prevent greed while working for the People. Lobby groups too.

1637 2018-08-26 21:44:28 I'm not blaming anybody, I didn't write the article, if people cant agree on stocks and has different opinions what makes anybody think they could ever agree on politics or religion. If you want trolls tweet politics or religion and see how many trolls comes out of the woodworks
1638 2018-08-26 21:42:51 No one in their right mind wants to ban all guns, I grew up around handguns, I just don't see a need for assault weapons, bump stocks and large capacity magazines in civilians hands
1639 2018-08-26 21:42:37 Goal of the week: learn more about investing in stocks
1640 2018-08-26 21:42:11 You're beyond vile and disgusting!!! Stricter background checks, banning assault weapons and bump stocks, and no @NRA money to buy politicians makes far more sense than your unstable genius(NOT) uneducated comments!!!
1641 2018-08-26 21:41:23 Preparing for CAIA, I came across a question that which asset class have performed best during periods of recession: and the answer was stocks and bonds beating treasury bills and gold. 

It’s all about the future in the business of businesses. #hindsight
1642 2018-08-26 21:41:02 Stop talking about gun control & the banning of assault weapons by ordinary citizens...bump stocks...it’s time to DO something!!!  Act!!
1643 2018-08-26 21:41:00 Since 01 July 2018, Blood is now free at all Public Health Institutions as announced by @MoHCCZim. The Government is now providing subsidy for blood in Zimbabwe. It is now our responsibility to have adequate blood stocks at all times for patients needing transfusions.
1644 2018-08-26 21:40:19 Since 01 July 2018, Blood is now free at all Public Health Institutions as announced by @MoHCCZim. The Government is now providing subsidy for blood in Zimbabwe. It is now our responsibility to donate blood so that there’s adequate blood stocks at all times.
1645 2018-08-26 21:39:50 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1646 2018-08-26 21:38:11 Then why did stocks soar the day he won? I'm confused.
1647 2018-08-26 21:37:29 My generosity will have to stop soon, my stocks are running low 
1648 2018-08-26 21:37:22 That sounds good. That would stop so called gun show loop hole. Btw, I don’t care if bump stocks are banned and I have no interest in owning one or a full auto.
1649 2018-08-26 21:35:44 But then again bump stocks are already illegal but yet they still are using them. There’s ways around everything. It’s sad but it’s reality
1650 2018-08-26 21:35:04 Just read Buffett has a plan to help SS. His plan raises the wage limit and then retirement age. Sounds great let’s do that on bonus’s and stock options like does with his income. If you get bonus in stocks you don’t pay any taxes until you sell them.
1651 2018-08-26 21:32:34 In Illinois for example you can't own throwing knives, or shuriken, or brass knuckles, or carry any object with the intent to cause bodily harm. That's a felony.

Concealed carry is legal.

AR-15s with bump stocks are legal.

This is the state of weapons in America nowadays
1652 2018-08-26 21:32:09 I went from a broker to an on- line self-directed account. Both retail and IRAs. Start with ETFs and gradually try some single stocks by paying attention to the financial news. Best decision I ever made. Besides buying my new boat.
1653 2018-08-26 21:31:30 Zayden asked me “What are stocks?” I told him in the best way I could and he goes “So if I buy your phone for one dollar, then I sell it to somebody else for 100 dollars, is that business?” I go “Yeah!”

..He goes “Wow, I could get a lot of video games.”

LOL there ya go, kid.

Or back introducing unpassable legislature in order to profit politically from the death of others while providing nothing to the citizens you promised to serve while attacking the Constitution you swore to uphold?
1655 2018-08-26 21:30:36 Good luck with ur #Trading this week #Stocks #Crypto #Cryptocurrency #Commodities #Currencies
1656 2018-08-26 21:30:11 You meant ANOTHER horrible tragedy. What's the cure? More guns. Guns that look like cell phones, guns you can make via 3d printer, guns in bikini selfies, bump stocks, NRAtv propaganda. It's the goddamn guns and gun peddlers that need to be removed.
1657 2018-08-26 21:29:27 I would love to know what some of these guys were thinking when they hung these late model bodies on these mini stocks
1658 2018-08-26 21:28:15 So if it is hidden then you aren’t afraid what does that have to do with this tragedy and bump stocks really wake up
1659 2018-08-26 21:27:56 -raise age to 21
-no automatic, semi-automatic, bump stocks, 3d printed guns
-buyer is allowed 1 rifle and 1 handgun
-limit on ammo
-buyers to be licensed for 6 mo w/ training classes, psych evaluation before able to buy a gun
-registrations renewed yearly, license every 3 years
1660 2018-08-26 21:27:07 Wtf ...somebody call an ambulance Brad's baton has left the building.  Stick to the penny stocks kid.
1661 2018-08-26 21:26:56 And honestly, assault weapons can kill more people more quickly than regular guns and as long as bump stocks are a thing an assault weapon can kill even more. The difference between assault weapons and semi-automatics is negligible... which is the problem.
1662 2018-08-26 21:26:56 -raise age to 21
-no automatic, semi-automatic, bump stocks, 3d printed guns
-buyer is allowed 1 rifle and 1 handgun
-limit on ammo
-buyers to be licensed for 6 mo w/ training classes, psych evaluation before able to buy a gun
-registrations renewed yearly, license every 3 years
1663 2018-08-26 21:26:54 11:00 GMT I think
1664 2018-08-26 21:26:00 That is right!!! So all you rich motherfu@ers who benefitted from those tax breaks bought more stocks instead of paying people more. GREAT.
1665 2018-08-26 21:25:59 And gaming stocks die too
1666 2018-08-26 21:25:30 Sole proprietor, my wife enjoys being retired, where I got bored. Sorry, no stocks for sale, privately held.

Actually, I do give a shit, because the better I do, the better the contractors, employees and so on do. So you see, it's not all about me.
1667 2018-08-26 21:24:45 @Tracytms don't buy canadian stocks watch Larry berman on bnn tomorrow at 11 am he's been saying it for years if u don't believe me only ones were energy and Butts and trudeau ruined that so what's left  canadian banks that's it or if u want to gamble marijuana stocks canopy
1668 2018-08-26 21:22:57 Ban bump stocks or other methods of increasing rate of fire, limit magazine capacities, require registration and certification akin to a driver’s test, require background checks where the fact that they don’t meet a deadline doesn’t automatically get you a gun 1/2
1669 2018-08-26 21:22:09 The market’s going to crash, either way, cause of your crooked rich republican lobbyists running it up to get common people to put money in market!! When they decide to the rich bastards are going to dump stocks at record pace and take all the common person’s money they can!!! 
1670 2018-08-26 21:21:36 Ask those same men and women how did it feel in May 2009 when they saw the GM stocks drop down to 75 cents
1671 2018-08-26 21:20:54 Also, I don't know if the president's biggest concerns should be stocks over, say, Flint water, shootings, national security, etc.
1672 2018-08-26 21:19:58 Tu étais dans les stocks 
1673 2018-08-26 21:18:22 let me tell you a little bit about how she was found. this scumbag stabbed her multiple times, put her in the trunk of his car and took her to a corn field where he dumped her and covered her body face up with fallen corn stocks. how would you feel if that was your relative?
1674 2018-08-26 21:17:03 what is the fastest way to add P/E charts on #tradingview?

I am surprised that there is no way to add it automatically to the charts, probably that’s why the majority of people is not making money on stocks @tradingview

1675 2018-08-26 21:13:47 Sorry to hear you missed out - we increase our stocks dramatically on offer days, but as you can imagine, we never know exactly how many people will come to store, so these offers are always on a first come, first served basis. The dozen in here looks to be pre-packed dozen..1/2
1676 2018-08-26 21:13:46 stocks rise by 1%.
1677 2018-08-26 21:11:00 All your super rich friends who got the enormous tax cuts that the rest of the country didn't get, bought back their own stocks instead of "trickling" the $$ down to their work forces or creating new jobs ! What a scam! Trump gets richer at the expense of the average American!
1678 2018-08-26 21:09:59 If you feel like you have missed the move or are under invested, it is never a good time to chase stocks.  We head into the last week of summer trading with most every leader in an extended position.  Lets allow for some healthy consolidation before putting new capital to work.
1679 2018-08-26 21:09:59 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1680 2018-08-26 21:09:48 Most Americans don’t own stocks. So much for Trump representing the “forgotten” people.
1681 2018-08-26 21:08:49 @Tracytms I've been on the site I'm an business person economic person I know the #s tracy and it's not adding up I manage my own financial affairs and I never invest in canada look at the CAD it's 1.30 and going lower  that tells u what the world thinks about canada I buy stocks
1682 2018-08-26 21:07:15 Ladies, please stick up for yourself! You deserve more than the shitty person out there bringing you down YOU ARE A 
1683 2018-08-26 21:06:05 I think we're in a time when people would rather be lied to than told the truth.  trump lies to his base and they accept it.  Bernie lies to his base and they accept it.  3rd party people lie to their base and they accept it.

The truth has become penny stocks and not blue chip.

1685 2018-08-26 21:02:57 How do you feel about banning bump stocks?
1686 2018-08-26 21:01:59 We tell our students that they should never need to buy books, as the library has stocks, but that personal copies are very helpful, and new isn't necessary. 5/n.
1687 2018-08-26 21:01:54 and also saying we haven't done anything is blatantly false
we are making bump stocks illegal because that obviously goes against the automatic weapons ban from the 80's
1688 2018-08-26 21:01:39 85% of stocks owned by the top 10% of earners
1689 2018-08-26 21:01:22 I inherited my stocks
1690 2018-08-26 21:00:49 Do you have any idea what it would take to repeal 2A?

We're talking bump stocks and background checks,  not repealing 2A.
1691 2018-08-26 21:00:12 Remember after Vegas how everyone pretty much agreed there was no reason to sell bump stocks?

Now remember when nobody did anything about it?
1692 2018-08-26 20:59:51 @Nigel_Farage @Arron_banks @piersmorgan Good News! We have all the stocks that matter, right about 1 mile away from my house in Pontefract Castle! Be there or be square! Courtesy of @YvetteCooperMP @NicolaSturgeon ! MARCHING ON TOGETHER! And you may never forget it!
1693 2018-08-26 20:59:10 5. Nofly list should = nobuy list 6. Ban bump stocks and some high-capacity magazines 7. Remove federal ban on CDC research $$$ to reduce gun violence 8. Remove prohibitions on suing gun manufacturers.... or, just do SOMETHING. Doing nothing hasn’t helped.
1694 2018-08-26 20:58:47 LOL You don't tell us Floridian how to vote lady.
You don't live here.
If you hate weapons so much, stop supporting The DNC they have stocks in The weapons manufacturers.
That's why They push all that Anti-Russia propaganda 
so people like you go along with more weapons.
Wake Up.
1695 2018-08-26 20:58:23 @jimcramer 
Jim, CVS, still bullish? amazon is cratoring healthcare stocks. Is amazon going to takeover the world?
1696 2018-08-26 20:57:46 The Parkland shooter was investigated based on tips to the FBI. The Sutherland Springs shooter is typical human error. 

And what about Las Vegas shooter?  He was lawfully in possession of his arsenal. 

How do you feel about bump stocks?
1697 2018-08-26 20:57:08 Just like momma stocks 
1698 2018-08-26 20:57:02 I’m not using a tragedy and not defending semiautomatic, automatics, bump stocks.. YOU KNOW THE ONES THEY USE TO KILL PEOPLE IN MASS WITH?
1699 2018-08-26 20:56:04 Apres ca depend aussi comment tu rentres chez toi, si c'est en voiture ca va si c'est en train ya 0 moyen que tu fasses de vrais stocks mdrr
1700 2018-08-26 20:55:22 Same with the WTO. They say that with all the lawsuits that’s going to happen because of his trade war it’s going to go belly up that’s what I read anyway I don’t know anything about that because I don’t trade with other countries and I don’t do the Stocks so not really adept in.
1701 2018-08-26 20:55:14 not in indexes, just stocks for me
1702 2018-08-26 20:53:26 You are a liar Trump , part of this is market corrections that were long due , the only stocks benefiting are based on unethical rule changes made by you to line the pockets of corrupt coperations. #LiarLiar #ResignNow
1703 2018-08-26 20:52:38 You forgot stocks & bonds, unless you're including that in QE? Also, the real estate bubble is back with a vengeance...
1704 2018-08-26 20:52:14 Hey Bill,  if our country would have just restricted bump stocks, 58 people wouldn't have died in Las Vegas. #STFU
1705 2018-08-26 20:51:35 I've mostly held my Li stocks all the way. It's been expensive but I can outlast the downturn.
1706 2018-08-26 20:50:29 When you’re old enough to have stocks and a retirement account, you’ll feel differently about Trump.  Also the reason young people are excluded from voting.  Zero real life experience.
1707 2018-08-26 20:50:17 Been getting into stocks
1708 2018-08-26 20:50:06 I have some stocks but like everything else it's a Gamble. And again what goes up eventually does come down. Monday morning I'm talking to my broker and selling some of my stocks.
1709 2018-08-26 20:49:35 Who is the USA? Only 10% of the wealthiest Americans own 84% of all stocks. The average American owns nothing. Great country!
1710 2018-08-26 20:49:23 You do realize that not all Americans have stocks...this means NOTHING to them. They’re still waiting to see any sign of a tax cut that seems to be landing heavily on the RICH!
1711 2018-08-26 20:49:06 @the_fishkeeper can you tell me if the Chesterfield (Dobbies branch) stocks any of the evolution aqua aquariums? Thanks

1717 2018-08-26 20:43:51 Bloomberg of anyone should know that the stock market is a very fickle financial machine. In matter of fact, I would sell off almost all my stocks the day he is impeached. Then buy them all back after a certain time and make a killing on profit!
1718 2018-08-26 20:43:45 apple stocks rise by 69%.
1719 2018-08-26 20:43:30 @SunriseTrader pot stock mania  hemp  now   look at the volume on some of those pot stocks  canb  cvsi cron
1720 2018-08-26 20:42:33 Uhhhhhhh...  No.  That is not what I mean.  Lets see, since being an investor in tech for decades, you know you are making progress when every quarter is an ATH.  I have seen literally 100s of ATH holding 2 stocks.  Tinkering at your ATH is 100% a good thing.  Get it?
1721 2018-08-26 20:42:09 As for the stock market and it being so good right now how many Americans even buy stocks? Duh
1722 2018-08-26 20:42:09 I think they know that their relationship with the United States is going to be drastically different as soon as we get scarface out of the Whitehouse. So they are pulling there money from our federal reserve stocks and buying middle east gold with it.
1723 2018-08-26 20:41:03 The Dow futures were down to 16,100 I believe on election night. Next day opened up with huge spreads. Never looked back.

Serious reporters said with certainty to sell all their stocks if Trump was elected because the market would crash.
1724 2018-08-26 20:38:32 Was the weapon involved a semi-automatic rifle with a pistol grip and a collapsible stock? 

Because politicians only want to do something about semi-automatic rifles with pistol grips and collapsible stocks.
1725 2018-08-26 20:37:37 the victims in vegas could be alive today if your pussbag of a president wasn't a 2 faced loser and stood up to the NRA and A: banned bump stocks, and B: at the least backed universal background checks.  feel free to eat shit bill
1726 2018-08-26 20:37:17 WE WILL NOT DISARM.....Muslim and HE DID address BUMP STOCKS so GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT...LEFTIST
1727 2018-08-26 20:35:59 Only rich people care about stocks. They are not an indicator of economic health
1728 2018-08-26 20:32:57 Uh no wait... gun owner here.
Ban semi automatics, bump stocks, automatics, stricter gun laws, background and MH checks
But you can’t take away my shotgun or my pistol that I have a license to carry (rarely do) to protect myself
1729 2018-08-26 20:32:53 What I enjoy most about post grad is waking up and checking my phone to see if anything went down last night just to find out that I drunkenly bought 5 stocks. We grown and we’re out here diversifying our portfolio at 1am.
1730 2018-08-26 20:32:38 Going to sell lithium stocks?
1731 2018-08-26 20:32:21 How many fully automatic weapons have been used in a crime? How many times have bump stocks been used in a crime?
1732 2018-08-26 20:31:11 yeah for sure and stocks made by myself and backgrounds by me also and usual other stuff smokes etc
1733 2018-08-26 20:29:33 The Fed has raised rates 7 times so far. Stocks are at record highs.  The old saying don’t fight the Fed didn’t work this time.

- open carry near schools
- bump stocks ban
- gun violence restraining orders
- school mental health funding

1735 2018-08-26 20:28:32 I own guns but most Americans want to improve gun safety: universal background checks, waiting periods, ban bump stocks & AR-15 like automatic guns, treat guns like cars w training, license, insurance requirements, raise age & look at gun nuts as a threat to national security
1736 2018-08-26 20:27:32 Too bad the working class can't afford to buy stocks! You need to be more concerned with helping the working class instead of big corporations and millionaires!

1737 2018-08-26 20:25:37 Concerts? -Kinda, no more bumps stocks*!  We did it guys!! 
*In some states, and it’s real hard to actually enforce.
1738 2018-08-26 20:25:36 we could try and prevent these disgusting shootings by tightening gun policies instead we allow things like bump stocks to be legal
1739 2018-08-26 20:24:50 I will never trust even TATA group even it comes to talking healthy when they come with rights whenever those individual stocks are a  their peak.
And trying to find some meat and honey in Concalls / Conferences is being willing to be biased.
1740 2018-08-26 20:24:34 Number of bump stocks used in mass shootings in American history : 1
1741 2018-08-26 20:24:09 I dont think he killed Osama pretty sure seals did, worse recovery after a recession ever. Most people on welfare ever. 8 million more on food stamps. Actually legalized bump stocks. Housing market crashed due to Clinton policies. ACA caused insurance to sky rocket. Maybe read
1742 2018-08-26 20:23:38 Market really proving a long-bias in my opinion this past week. Stocks are hitting 52 week highs left and right and most are keeping their gains. Would be very careful if you are a short-biased trader this upcoming week. Be patient or just start going long
1743 2018-08-26 20:23:00 Too soon to tell on this one.

But AR-15's with bump stocks can be purchased by a legimate tax paying parent, and then taken by a teenager who goes and ends 20 lives.
1744 2018-08-26 20:22:13 Bump stocks have never/almost never been used in a mass shooting. Bump stocks are a Democratic pearl clutching attempt.

Everything else is valid, however
1745 2018-08-26 20:22:07 Stocks = 150% of US GDP now. #Fed can't allow a prolonged meltdown due to the negative effect on Federal Tax Receipts, the budget deficit and the perception of US solvency. Only factors driving stocks higher are artificial: CB stimulus and buybacks. Both fading.
1746 2018-08-26 20:22:07 Background checks & waiting periods to start. Licensing makes sense in theory, but voter ID has been declared discriminatory so not sure how gun licensing wouldn't also be discriminatory. Totally support bans on anything that increases rate of fire (bump stocks).
1747 2018-08-26 20:20:49 You're a dope!
FYI ANYBODY from ANY country can buy stocks that are traded on the Nasdaq, Dow Jones and S&P 500... So really, Thanks WORLD!
1748 2018-08-26 20:19:54 What happened to Daddy Warbucks banning bump stocks?
1749 2018-08-26 20:19:18 @TradeWithNinja you have a scan that you can get mid Kelt stocks? Like those for bounces.
1750 2018-08-26 20:18:58 No more fucking thoughts and prayers !                           A National gun registration , no access to semi automatic weapons , or bump stocks ! NOW !!
1751 2018-08-26 20:18:44 YOU SERIOUSLY think these changes made a difference? Go drink acid.

Raises the age to purchase a gun, 
bans bump stocks and allows law enforcement, with the approval of a judge, to bar a person deemed dangerous due to mental illness from owning guns for up to a year.
1752 2018-08-26 20:18:36 The should bandage of salmonella stocks .   
1753 2018-08-26 20:17:40 That was 4 2-stocks in a row
1754 2018-08-26 20:17:34 Best Performing Stocks never come under the Radar. Its only the Back Benchers who need to  be monitored.
1755 2018-08-26 20:17:15 Grocery stores stocks are probably increasing tremendously due to all of the pregnant chicks nowadays.
1756 2018-08-26 20:16:01 When you say the "country" you mean the CEO/Billionaires that made out like bandits with the tax cut scam you shoved through.  What about the rising cost of Health care, gas, groceries and rent?  What about people who don't own stocks? Get real.
1757 2018-08-26 20:15:33 Only trading prescreened stocks that fit my criteria and patterns that are in my playbook.
1758 2018-08-26 20:15:22 No one is talking about taking away all guns, sensible gun control is all we want, ban AR15s and guns like it, bump stocks and high capacities magazines, universal background checks and raise the age to 21 to purchase guns plus stiff penalties when caught selling guns illegally
1759 2018-08-26 20:15:08 guys, no extra stocks unless mentioned, especially LY tour merchs
1760 2018-08-26 20:14:05 I don't really think about what everyone else is doing because it's impossible to know, if its a good resistance level & meets my rules I'll bet on it. With current sentiment where it is on stocks I don't think many people are looking short to begin with.
1761 2018-08-26 20:13:55 Are any of the CDC doctors that wrote the guidelines even qualified in addictionology or pain management ? I want to see proof if they are. I think they have degrees in marketing and stocks in Suboxone. Or ties to drug cartels.
1762 2018-08-26 20:13:32 A federal ban on bump stocks wouldn't do anything.

If you have gun control that would actively fight the violent crime rate in the United States, please bring it forward. Nothing proposed has any studies to show that it would lower it.

1766 2018-08-26 20:11:52 He visto ausencia de productos en estantes, o los están escondiendo como hemos visto o la cantidad de compra x el bono y precios acordados bajan los stocks muy rápido y pareciera q la capacidad de respuesta es baja de los distribuidores OJO
1767 2018-08-26 20:11:48 I have a calendar just for stocks. Write my gains / losses / events on it. Small thing that helps me maintain focus.
1768 2018-08-26 20:11:24 Out of stocks = lost profit. On non-perishable foods kind of makes sense to ensure you don't miss a sale. As a customer it annoys the fuck out of me when the small stores are missing a key ingredient for my dinner, I'll go somewhere else to get it, they lose the whole basket
1769 2018-08-26 20:11:22 Don’t be scared of stock that has had done very well the last years. There’s a reason why they are the winning stocks #Amazon #Facebook #investing
1770 2018-08-26 20:10:54 Sensible gun laws won't solve all of the problems, but it's a start, and it removes several enabling factors from the equation.

No one needs to own firearms that were specifically designed to kill people. (assault rifles, high capacity magazines, laser sights, bump stocks, etc.)
1771 2018-08-26 20:09:38 Why would lithium stocks rise in the future? It's not rare. Also lithium is like the lowest constituent in lithium ion batteries.
 Due to recent increase in price, production ramp up of lithium is also outpacing demand. All good for the batteries.
1772 2018-08-26 20:08:38 Jawed Angels? More like the Battleaxe Brigade! How's about Aging Bimbo Eruption? Are these She-devils the ones with BIG pocketbooks paying @KathyKLTran & Surovell to stage such buffoonery? These Dems=laughing-stocks. So embarrassing! 
1773 2018-08-26 20:06:52 If you’re going to invest in stocks, look into pharmaceutical companies or the marijuana industry. CBD is making a killing right now. 
1774 2018-08-26 20:06:09 3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 Years
1775 2018-08-26 20:04:41 Background checks are already a thing, automatic weapons are banned for civilian purchase, licenses are required in most states some only for ccw though, and  I agree with mental health evaluations. Don't know how prevalent bump stocks are so I won't comment on that
1776 2018-08-26 20:04:05 That wouldn’t be a bad idea. I would buy more stocks if that where to happen.

1779 2018-08-26 20:00:38 The last place Florida needs help from is Texas.  What are we going to do, send them more guns and bump stocks?
1780 2018-08-26 20:00:22 "Single handedly resurrected NYC" what planet are you living on?  He would also be richer today if he put Daddy's money in stocks and shares.  He's a shit business man and always was but he's a great conman I'll give him that.
1781 2018-08-26 19:59:52 it was FD LOOOOL. i picked gimpy close to last and he took like 8 stocks
1782 2018-08-26 19:59:15 Holding on to stocks longer than your opponent is the way to win
1783 2018-08-26 19:58:28 Yet somehow they don’t to this degree in countries that restrict access to assault weapons and bump stocks. #NationalTeachABotDay
1784 2018-08-26 19:58:21 @DOEDoobs You got me wanting to get back on my Robinhood game bro! I pulled out just because I was having a hard time figuring out which stocks to invest in. Do you cover or know any resources that would point me in the right direction of what to look for in a quality stock?
1785 2018-08-26 19:55:54 Because of your tax cuts companies buy their own stocks ...so e.g. S&P 500 teach record highs. You are inflating balloons....they will pop soon !!
1786 2018-08-26 19:55:37 Man, remember when, after the deadliest mass shooting in modern history, Trump attacked Obama for not banning bump stocks (which Obama wanted to do but concluded would be unconstitutional), claimed he would do it himself, then just totally dropped the subject? That was wild.
1787 2018-08-26 19:55:12 1) ban bump stocks & high volume cartridges 2) universal background checks 3) accountability for safe  & secure storage 4) ban military style assault riffles
1788 2018-08-26 19:55:11 Your central bank is printing money for themselves so they can buy stocks themselves inflating your ridiculous stock market bubble. Once the people wake up, the system collapses. You're either too stupid top realize yourself, or too selfish to stop it.
1789 2018-08-26 19:55:00 I think I'm going to look into investing into stocks tomorrow. Imma let my money make me money 
1790 2018-08-26 19:54:36 Bump stocks were actually made illegal.
1791 2018-08-26 19:54:20 If rumors of your impeachment were true stocks would rise, a decline in stocks means you are staying in office. Bad news!
1792 2018-08-26 19:53:42 Stocks are looking great!
1793 2018-08-26 19:53:20 taeminnie talking abt lands, stocks and stuffs six years ago and now he's into buying buildings & properties for his families to make profit and right there 6 years ago he knew what he wanted wow i stan a right man
1794 2018-08-26 19:53:06 Of course it is.  With the GOP tax cut, the rich and corporations are buying their own company's stocks.  Pretty soon publicly traded stocks will be non-existent. Thanks for your efforts to concentrate all wealth in the hands of the rich!
1795 2018-08-26 19:52:50 Only authorised sellers allowed to sell guns, banning bump stocks, enforce the law of no ex-con/ criminal record allowed to own a gun. Many many rules.
1796 2018-08-26 19:50:12 Coins I don't mention, but hodl between 1K-2Kshares via house money.(left over after pulled profits) FUNFAIR, FUEL, DNT, SNT, MANA, ZIL, IOST, IOTX, SAFEX, COSS, STORM, LEND, NCASH(GARBAGE), Coins/Stocks I have in my RAGS 2 RICHES."Poor Mans Picks-A Success Story"=VIP only.
1797 2018-08-26 19:49:52 Can you mention when it’s appropriate to sell stocks we have invested in ?
1798 2018-08-26 19:48:16 There are not yet federal laws on bump stocks or requiring background checks...that’s “strict” to you? People are still able to buy a device that makes semi automatic weapons into fully automatic weapons.
1799 2018-08-26 19:47:15 Exactly. I wonder if the average blue collar worker gives a crap about GDP or stocks.
1800 2018-08-26 19:46:59 It should. All those rich people and corporations you gave those big tax cuts to are buying up stocks left and right.  Didn’t put any of it into employee wages.
1801 2018-08-26 19:45:45 If America doesn't want to be known for shootings they would get rid of the second amendment. But no. The capitalist pigs who only think of themselves, put lots of money in weapon stocks. Making them richer when people buy guns of a particular make. And saying we still need guns.
1802 2018-08-26 19:45:30 @redstocks @erikrg44 @rpic I should clarify...I’m speaking from a U.S. standpoint because frankly, U.S. money moves these stocks more
1803 2018-08-26 19:44:44 China is working toward socialism right now and I've seen many corporations tackled down by the government and it seems to be losing people more jobs and money in stocks at the moment, but in a few years we will see if it benefitted the country overall.
1804 2018-08-26 19:43:46 Would love some consolidation to reload on these stocks. These prices starting to feel like a trap BUT then again US bulls are nothing to play with as you said
1805 2018-08-26 19:43:34 If you had to sell all your stocks but could keep three, which would you retain? 

1 - #NCCL 
2 - #INFA 
3 - #SML 

Would be mine.
1806 2018-08-26 19:42:55 You do know that those weapons can also can be use to fire as slow as one chooses, right?  They do not have to be used at a high rate of fire.   They offer a longer sight radius and shoulder stocks  so are more accurate than handguns.
1807 2018-08-26 19:39:56 The stocks went down like shit fr
1808 2018-08-26 19:39:47 What does he trade? Stocks? Beaver pelts? ... go back to grade school and learn your big boy words .
1809 2018-08-26 19:38:58 Juste une question pourquoi ? Si tous les hommes noirs étaient comme moi, votre produit de merde allaient pourrir ds vos stocks quelle honte après ces vous qui hurle partt Racisme ici et par-là, commencez d'abord a vous aimez et surtt a valoriser cette sublime peau.
1810 2018-08-26 19:38:19 Majority of Americans, don’t own stocks...
1811 2018-08-26 19:36:40 Is there a good company to invest in Australia ? 
I look for Divident Stocks , Growth stocks ,
1812 2018-08-26 19:35:05 Tier 3 are 1-4 year savings goals.. I keep these as @Betterment account goals as well. I am a big fan of their tactic of using a mix of stocks and bonds to maintain your accounts the closer you get to pulling your money out. #Personalfinance.
1813 2018-08-26 19:34:43 No one has ever said they will. We need simple steps to reduce this. Universal background checks and banning bump stocks. Why don’t people understand this?
1814 2018-08-26 19:34:42 Some more stocks that look interesting this week $NEM $TACO $RRR
1815 2018-08-26 19:34:09 Pls name them. AR 15, Aks, gun shows on and on. Have bump stocks been outlawed? Where is Trump on metal detectors in school, security guards? Hasnt done anything because he wants NRA Money?
1816 2018-08-26 19:32:57 There isn’t anything to chart on this one. It’s in a long base and when it flies it flies I guess.  I prefer to trade stocks near their highs :)
1817 2018-08-26 19:32:27 Seems milking thfc is more profitable than currency speculation and stocks  he lost near on £2b when bear sterns when tits up clawed all that back with epl money and fickle fans.
1818 2018-08-26 19:32:24 Our reaction "we are moving to other platforms and leaving yb" I wonder if that answer some of their questions, if yb stocks start falling then we would prove we have power, I'm scared. Anyone knows how they are doing?
1819 2018-08-26 19:27:29 Finally! Someone has articulated what I think should happen!  His cabinet and VP are laughing stocks.
1820 2018-08-26 19:26:35 Je peux fumer autant que je veux.

*Offre dans la limite des stocks disponibles*
1821 2018-08-26 19:26:32 Control is just another word for regulation;

Background checks
No sales to felons or seriously mentally ill
Waiting periods
Ban automatic weapons
Ban gun stocks
21 years old to purchase
Register guns
Require safety locks
Etc
1822 2018-08-26 19:26:12 More than 93% of stocks are owned by the top 20%.
The bottom 80% owns only about 7%.
1823 2018-08-26 19:25:42 The most common "argument" I see is
"If they're so good they should make enough themselves without having to charge!"

This is not logical at all. Think of the stock broker again, should he not charge for being your stock broker just because he could make money on stocks himself?
1824 2018-08-26 19:23:39 This is just business. People charge for things. It's not personal.

Many people don't see betting as an investment, but that's what it is. 

Say you wanted to invest into stocks to make money. Unless you know what you're doing you may hire a stock broker.
1825 2018-08-26 19:21:56 Trump also said he would do something quickly quickly on bump stocks..
1826 2018-08-26 19:19:34 en bonne comptabilité il y a les stocks et les flux ... les stocks ça cumule les flux ...
1827 2018-08-26 19:19:27 Don't play the penny stocks.
1828 2018-08-26 19:19:17 أدنى سعر وصل اليه السهم خلال ١٠ سنوات ٢٤٨ حاليا السعر ٢٩٩ يوجد نموذج رأس و كتفين  سلبي في احتمال ينزل يعني حاول تصيده علي ٢٨٦ و اشتر علي مراحل
1829 2018-08-26 19:18:01 First of all bump stocks. Way to keep up with the news and laws. That only happened like 6 months ago. Where do you think we have the manpower to round up all these guns?
1830 2018-08-26 19:17:58 All analysis is on the platform now I hope everyone enjoys. #stocks
1831 2018-08-26 19:14:52 Failing to see the point, think there could be better examples. He didn't simply "trade penny stocks"
1832 2018-08-26 19:14:39 The function of bump stocks can be recreated with a belt.

How are you going to ban that?
1833 2018-08-26 19:13:19 We don't have control of our fish stocks while we are in the EU. Thanks for highlighting this issue.
1834 2018-08-26 19:12:36 Dont you mean "congratulations to the richest 10% who own 84% of all stocks"?
1835 2018-08-26 19:12:00 Red flag laws. Background checks. Take away guns from ppl convicted of domestic abuse. Technology so only registered owner can pull trigger. Ban bump stocks. Should I go on?
1836 2018-08-26 19:11:39 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
1837 2018-08-26 19:09:36 Mr X. I missed some good stocks like AMD. I Kept waiting for pull back that never happened. Should I just buy them now or get them next time u add?
1838 2018-08-26 19:08:26 Oh dear Ben A you were my grandma’s attorney and wrote her first will In late 90’s!! Then ordered my dad to see you for a claim! Hmmm then wrote the trust and will I have noted stocks were inc. to my surprise you and fiduciary partners filed probate saying no will!! Wtf wheres$
1839 2018-08-26 19:07:53 @MarioGabelli Mr. Gabelli, I hope your day is well. I’m looking to set up a miniature stock portfolio consisting of 5 stocks for my son who is almost 2.  What 5 stocks would you recommend other than Netflix, Facebook, Amazon, and Google? Thank you for your time.
1840 2018-08-26 19:07:47 How many presentations can be given on the subject. Big time random.
1841 2018-08-26 19:06:23 Kanye West bought his wife stocks in Netflix. This is the best thing one can do for their wife. Netflix's shares are soaring bro and not only that but it's also slowly killing traditional ways of releasing movies/ TV series.

1845 2018-08-26 19:04:42 @markminervini hello Mark, I have some questions about your upcoming book. Is it going to be a pure self-help book? Or your life story and the methods you used to achieve your goals? And are you going to include specific advice for trading?

Keep up the great work 
1846 2018-08-26 19:04:23 Thank you for the follow. And also, if you want to hang out tonight, then I’ll be streaming on YouTube at 6pm CST
1847 2018-08-26 19:03:51 Have you checked out the prices on Rally Road app?   Seem to be 25-33% overpriced and most cars aren’t that special.   Another sign of a topping market ( stocks, classic cars, wine, art, fashion purses)
1848 2018-08-26 19:03:08 Gotta ban shutter speeds and zoom stocks
1849 2018-08-26 19:03:02 Who wants sore stocks?  (The President asked himself out loud)
1850 2018-08-26 19:02:49 How people can put other artists stocks or stuff from google and then make a pack with it
1851 2018-08-26 19:02:15 first it was bump stocks....now it'll be an outcry for laser sights to be banned
1852 2018-08-26 19:01:02 I agree, stocks allone are not appropriate for little Joe: too risky, if he can't afford to loose from his savings. That's a real problem, especially in a fonds-based pension system.
1853 2018-08-26 19:00:09 I Don’t see the point on making a pack with other artists stocks and then get some money with it.
1854 2018-08-26 18:59:55 C’est pas tout ça, mais les stocks de prune s’épuisent. Encore une semaine de broyage et à dans un an chez le bouilleur (s’il existe encore).
1855 2018-08-26 18:59:23 @welcometotfs Nishant Bhai, you've said, "Always remember, day trading is all about volatility whereas swing trading is all about momentum". How do we find momentum in stocks? Please guide through. (Above statement you said in the 10 steps of trade selection post)
1856 2018-08-26 18:58:41 Lol! How much u fit worth sef? na to sell u, go buy stocks with either Nigeria Breweries, Coca-cola or Dangote Cement..
1857 2018-08-26 18:58:32 You are such a piece of garbage. If you had 1% of that man in your character you would be 1% of a leader and a man. I love my stocks and 401k going up but at what cost....the whole world disrespecting us? Mmmm
1858 2018-08-26 18:58:15 @elonmusk You are loved
1859 2018-08-26 18:54:13 @FoxNews Trump talks about the stock market 50% of stock is owned by non US entities and the majority of Rural USA lower and middle class across the US don’t own stocks or work for a public company. Trickle down economics has NEVER worked!

1861 2018-08-26 18:53:07 Stall managers reducing their Red Stripes stocks to make room for umbrellas. Todday's #NottingHillCarnival offered a brilliant example to illustrate the principles of hedging.
1862 2018-08-26 18:52:46 My stocks never went this high when Obama was President. Your living in la la land!
1863 2018-08-26 18:52:06 Stock market is giving me a headache I think when the seasons change I will go more aggressive with my top 2 stocks

1867 2018-08-26 18:48:03 @i_like_bb_stock  watch out for @GeorgeASharp he keeps posting tweets saying stocks are bad but he is actually buying.  He is a snake
1868 2018-08-26 18:47:17 What's for tea tonight Mike 
1869 2018-08-26 18:46:23 Lols while people were busy buying FCMB, Zenith Bank, Total, Mobile etc stocks, you were busy following adverts on AIT it’s wisdom.....you lack it
1870 2018-08-26 18:46:17 As if Obama wasn't/isn't crooked himself? He just knows how to hide the money. Millions invested in Solar Energy for his benefit. He bought solar stocks, then put Americans Dollars into alt energy programs. Donald, does not own coal company stocks, he just cares about the workers
1871 2018-08-26 18:45:44 So this is supposed  to be pinned but i can’t think of anything smart to say so...

1873 2018-08-26 18:45:18 Your a fool. Stocks are down.
1874 2018-08-26 18:44:48 Good job.. wouldn’t fancy my chances with you in a pile on!!
1875 2018-08-26 18:44:36 What’s the increase in the median (not mean average) non-supervisory wage (not income aka stocks) adjusted for inflation?

I’ll tell you...it’s flat 

& that is the metric of how the economy is for the majority of WORKING Americans
1876 2018-08-26 18:44:15 I expect correlations to go from zero to positive in the event of a stocks bear market i.e. crypto to crash as well.
1877 2018-08-26 18:43:03 I hope you realize they’re telling you to vote no, because as of currently marijuana can’t be sold through pharmacies, of which the church owns millions of dollars of stocks. They want you to vote no because they can’t make money if you vote yes.
1878 2018-08-26 18:42:49 Exactly, no need to buy books if the school library stocks them. I’ll certainly be making the most of our school’s library this year.
1879 2018-08-26 18:42:38 Sorry Dave but I think he’s for real.
Only thing I want to know.

1888 2018-08-26 18:34:25 "Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets" by John J. Murphy is considered the "bible" of TA.

Otherwise "How to Make Money in Stocks: A Winning System in Good Times and Bad" by William O'Neil Is good. He is the pioneer who actually first identified cup and handles.

1892 2018-08-26 18:32:28 And Donald is fascinated with stuff.  Only issue is cost of living is higher, that Stock Market Dow is a farce.  Price weighted and they swap stocks faster than you can blink when a stock has issues.  My expendable cash has shrunk all because of "TAX CUTS" that raised my taxes.

1909 2018-08-26 18:20:34 Who knows how to work and understand stocks ?
1910 2018-08-26 18:20:05 Yes, red arrows are buy points. I position size new buys at about 5% account size or less for stocks, higher for ETF’s. This keeps risk per trade for any one position almost insignificant.
1911 2018-08-26 18:19:20 More than a small percentage of Americans own U.S. stocks. Individuals and firms from endless nations own U.S. stocks and get profits. So many assist and benefit the U.S. economy.
1912 2018-08-26 18:19:20 I just hope and wish he sold all his stocks practicing his preach :)
1913 2018-08-26 18:19:08 I Graduated From The Block Now It’s Stocks And Bonds
1914 2018-08-26 18:17:53 I think the only way to deal with this stuff is to clearly stay as close to TOS as possible, understanding one is disadvantaged bc of yt's bias. All the while getting a piece of the company thru stocks and advertiser leverage. Once the sponsors are in line, the rest will follow.
1915 2018-08-26 18:16:58 Omg WHO is that for Caroline?!
1916 2018-08-26 18:16:49 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to treat your fibromyalgia
1917 2018-08-26 18:16:05 Do not deal with Lilly products or stocks
1918 2018-08-26 18:16:00 Nice for only 10% of Americans who have some limited stocks and the 10% figure also includes what is held in their pension plans.
1919 2018-08-26 18:15:10 Defrauding & bankrupting blue-collar people is not his personal life that’s business but do see why u need to separate the two tho. Now about the Economy it’s a joke! stocks are up because companies are buying back their stocks it’s not real growth! Wages are still low.
1920 2018-08-26 18:14:58 In terms of risk as a % of the account, 1%-2% is fine for most people, 3% is aggressive, and 4%-5% is insanity, imo #stocks
1921 2018-08-26 18:14:26 Perfect time 2 IMPEACH!!No,u could be impeached any time & stocks would surpass expectations!Wouldn't affect the economy 1 whit. 
Impeach @realDonaldTrump-watch stocks SOAR! 
Friday is NAUGHT compared 2 the rise we'll see on September 1'st.
MERE DAYS AWAY @HouseGOP @SenateGOP!
1922 2018-08-26 18:12:06 Maybe they also sign up with Rialto like Bittrex  trading stocks
1923 2018-08-26 18:11:32 He probably means his stocks.
1924 2018-08-26 18:11:12 5000 cars a month/week that aren’t selling, make more blowtorches, cleanup old burnt out cardboard, convince feds. I was just playin around, didn’t really mean it, pay off thousands of people who bought Tesla stocks, complete apology to all the giggling short people, convince
1925 2018-08-26 18:10:40 They paid him in Trump Casino Stocks and Bonds
1926 2018-08-26 18:10:29 It's all comes to money matters definitely sure the seasons he wasted in brutally stocks
1927 2018-08-26 18:10:18 I think in 2004/5 there was an index called capital goods index,nowadays it don't appears 
Your mentioned all stocks were part of it.....
1928 2018-08-26 18:08:06 He is n control but is known to look at experts to help him..He is a proud non PC man who won't let America fail under his watch..Stocks higher than they've ever been Fri..GDP 4.1.we have our religious freedom back.
1929 2018-08-26 18:07:01 Would you invest in US Cannabis Stocks?

"With the US still waiting for Federal laws to change in favor of Cannabis, is now a good time to be invested in US Cannabis Companies who operate in states where it's legal to do so. Similar to Canada before legalization..."
1930 2018-08-26 18:06:26 I suspect that one day I'll be able to buy stocks and etfs that pay dividends in crypto. And I'll buy the heck out of those!
1931 2018-08-26 18:06:15 Bump stocks are already going away, extended mags wouldnt change anything so thats pointless, to carry a gun with a ccw you do have to pass a class. We already have to pass a federal background check
1932 2018-08-26 18:04:33 Not everyone has stocks moron especially your trailer park trash
1933 2018-08-26 18:02:41 Four of the stocks I've bought have increased on value, five of them have decreased. Overall I've lost 79¢ but tbh investing is fun. It's strange but I find it fun in the same way that I find a game fun. Basically investing means playing the risk and trying to beat the average.
1934 2018-08-26 18:02:01 WOW!!!!!You need mental help to get back on track with reality. Oh yeah don't forget assault weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, and fewer background checks.
1935 2018-08-26 18:01:32 The central banks print money to invest into the top stocks... How is that good for the economy..
1936 2018-08-26 18:00:16 I would be shorting stocks now given your exposure to serious legal implications.
1937 2018-08-26 17:59:19 Common stocks
1938 2018-08-26 17:59:17 Here's what you're  missing: growth rests on 10 stocks like Amazon doing amazingly well.  Everything else is simply holding steady.
1939 2018-08-26 17:59:02 1) Stocks are not the only assets. Art, bonds, land, private equity, cash and gold are all assets.

2) Cramer advocates against 10+ stocks because it can quickly become a full time job. 

3) Some funds are expensive and dont have enough #skininthegame
1940 2018-08-26 17:56:39 I thought so too. There may be a chance. Their other out of stocks are still showing. While these disappeared. Also went on ebay didnt see any real proof/screenshots of confirmations. So there may be a chance.
1941 2018-08-26 17:56:26 Blue tuna is a great example. Companies would rather fish them into extinction because there’s more money to be had in scarcity then to help rehab and protect stocks to the point where population numbers are healthy. It’s a sickening system we live in.
1942 2018-08-26 17:56:00 all of my stocks are listed as higher than before. I just sold a few of them and made hella profit. if that’s not proof I don’t know what is.. but either way, that’s really all I care about 
1943 2018-08-26 17:55:29 #TraitorTrump DONALD TRUMP IS A JOKE, HE THINKS THE STOCKS ARE GONE UP BECAUSE HE IS DONE SUCH A GOOD JOB, AND THE REAL REASON IS BECAUSE HE IS ON THE WAY OUT
1944 2018-08-26 17:54:01 If you want to go long, you should enter the markets which are strongest. If you want to go short, you should enter the markets which are weakest. For stocks, 52 WH signifies strength and 52 WL shows weakness. You can think on similar lines, for other markets.
#findingtrades
1945 2018-08-26 17:53:16 Thank goodness for Obama setting up the recovery, despite @realDonaldTrump. If you look at the charts, 96% of the stock gains came under Obama. Stocks have been stagnant under @realDonaldTrump.
1946 2018-08-26 17:53:10 Either way the Growth story is over. Time to reset the stocks valuation.
1947 2018-08-26 17:52:29 Trump didn’t go to Barbara Bush’s funeral either. I don’t find that odd. He’s trying to run our country and by the looks of my stocks he’s doing pretty dam good
1948 2018-08-26 17:51:20 Most people do not lose money in stocks because of error in calculations but because of their lack of faith in their own calculations.
1949 2018-08-26 17:51:13 Get over it.  News that moves stocks breaks all the time during the day.  What would a halt do, change the value of the tweet? No. Change the news itself? No.  Caveat emptor.  If you screwed up, own it.
1950 2018-08-26 17:50:53 I did meant anything. The TOP 10% did not need a tax break. They are taking that money and reinvesting in their stocks. 80% of the TOP 10% owns the nations stocks. And the tax cut did not benefit workers. at all Wages are stagnant and we need more revenue into the treasury.
1951 2018-08-26 17:50:46 I hear ya. It’s impossible to remove our bias and opinions about a stocks “story”, which is why I try my hardest to keep it technical. For me, a rising price in a long term uptrend is reason enough (solid recent earnings doesn’t hurt ).
1952 2018-08-26 17:50:21 Stocks go up he's doing something right 
1953 2018-08-26 17:49:15 My esop stocks are down actually.
1954 2018-08-26 17:48:55 SEBI annual report                   Top 40 stocks account for 74% of FPIs’ equity portfolios in India
Top 40 stocks account for 63% of MFs’equity portfolios in India
Top 40 stocks account for 83% of LIC’s equity portfolio in India .       Guys.This is known as concentration risk
1955 2018-08-26 17:48:27 What was those again? Only the rich gain anything from all this unless you have stocks
1956 2018-08-26 17:48:08 Presidente Trump, the economy is doing great except the Fanny May Freddy Mack stocks, liberate them the common stock too. How can the US take privately owned companies for their own benefit, unheard.
1957 2018-08-26 17:47:58 Pretty sure most of them don't own stocks and have no idea that the stock market doing good doesn't help them at all.
1958 2018-08-26 17:47:35 Bump stocks are hard AF to use. Most trained military members wouldn't even be able to figure them out fyi. I agree with if you buy a gun there should be classes taken but background checks already exsist. Also buying guns from thier own state wouldn't fix a lot, still illegal
1959 2018-08-26 17:47:07 هل تمكنت من اقتناص صفقات رابحة خلال دورة الصعود السابقة ل #مؤشر_السوق_السعودي #تاسي ؟ وذلك الفترة التي امتدت من 28 نوفمبر 2017 حتى 8 أغسطس 2018.

1960 2018-08-26 17:42:20 I will say it again: We Need a Strike to shutdown this country to wake big corporations up. All they have been doing is buying back stocks/paying off CEO’s and shareholders.
1961 2018-08-26 17:42:17 YTD #US #IPOs are up18.5%, #S&P500 up 7% and #NASDAQ up 14%. #stocks #stockstowatch #markets
1962 2018-08-26 17:42:09 No need to focus on 5-10 stocks when trading, your mind will get cluttered and your attention will be diverted in too many directions. Don't spread your mind and account out too thin. It can cause burnout quickly
1963 2018-08-26 17:41:43 Port Royal Speedway will kick off the 164th annual Juniata County Fair coming up Saturday, September 1 when it hosts the Butch Renninger Memorial for ULMS Late Models along with the 410 sprints, econo late models and xtreme stocks, at 7 pm.
1964 2018-08-26 17:40:50 The focus for this week will be... $GOOGL if we can break above 1242-1244 range, bigger upside can be triggered... Watch this one closely... Out of the FANG stocks, this one has the best r/r currently
1965 2018-08-26 17:38:59 Flat US yield curve, gap between 2 & 10 year bonds is 0.2%, no sign of inflation. Let’s wait for the next #DonaldJTrump tweet #Stocks #market #DJIA #NASDAQ #CNBC
1966 2018-08-26 17:38:26 Tja warst halt cocky. Wie wenn du denkst dass du nach zwei Stocks schon das Set in der Tasche hast. Du kommst wieder auf die Beine.
1967 2018-08-26 17:37:37 Jetzt aber. :D
Branden Gracel erhält 2 Minuten wegen hohen Stocks. Die Zuschauer stimmen dem nicht ganz zu. #esvhcp
1968 2018-08-26 17:36:55 Nah penny stocks are riskier, its an immense waste of time to throw away money. But hey if it works for you then keep at it

I hardly think people who invest in blue chips are trying to "seem cool"
1969 2018-08-26 17:35:37 Not a big fan of BB’s myself. I like to catch major moves in stocks, longer term. BB’s are more of a shorter-term swing system that’s too much in-and-out for me.
1970 2018-08-26 17:35:22 To increase stocks?
1971 2018-08-26 17:32:32 R u buying its stocks?
1972 2018-08-26 17:29:46 I’d argue that a raging stock market is actually an indicator that working people are going to get screwed. It’s all about outlook & projections. Stocks have surged as Trump started rolling back consumer protections & corporate regulations, which ultimately screws working ppl.
1973 2018-08-26 17:29:43 You are delusional. The average person doesn't own stocks and could not care less about you and your buddies making $$ hand over fist!!
1974 2018-08-26 17:29:36 NEW STOCKS!!!
1975 2018-08-26 17:29:08 My stocks and I are tremoudously grateful.
1976 2018-08-26 17:28:56 Factors would include financial over extension in speculative stocks, interest rates and inflation, political risks and panic.
1977 2018-08-26 17:27:43 Look at the stocks and prove me wrong
1978 2018-08-26 17:27:19 So you do not worry about your own credit card debt or that of other family members that assists those who profit from owning stocks?

1980 2018-08-26 17:26:26 ZERO Dems voted for tax cuts for wealthy & corporations.

ZERO Dems voted for "one time only" bonuses, flat wages, and inflation, while corps boost stocks.

ZERO Dems voted for tried(FAILED!) "trickle-down economics."
1981 2018-08-26 17:25:41 Rich people buy assets like businesses, real estate, stocks and bonds etc.   This book definitely telling the truth!
1982 2018-08-26 17:24:47 Stop using this stock market thing every president has hit an all time on stocks u loser sure was big spike but you gave that tax cut to the rich of course their making more money and stock is up.
1983 2018-08-26 17:23:15 sure. its in range 250-350. either buy on breakout of 350 top or own it at lower end of range 250. Put the stop below 250 . nifty auto index is at support which usually good for individual stocks of that index
1984 2018-08-26 17:21:26 2/ And how about this?
WaPo: Yes, stocks are up. But 80 percent of the value is held by the richest 10 percent.
1985 2018-08-26 17:20:21 invest in businesses on some rick ross shit. invest in wingstop, or buy into some penny stocks.
1986 2018-08-26 17:19:35 Setting #MAGA records 1 after another! Can't wait 2 see what happens in the next 5 yrs under @realDonaldTrump then 8 more under @VP #WalkAway Record collections in taxes jobs unemployment stocks 401K lower taxes more business's ISIS gone working on fair trade etc #AmericansFirst
1987 2018-08-26 17:18:35 Stock market has nothing to do with the economy. Ask the poverty class if they are buying stocks.
1988 2018-08-26 17:18:20 Follow the trend and make money.
And if the stocks plunge?
Follow the trend and make money.
If they lateralize?
Follow the trend and make money. 
You only have to make money, if it's UP, if it's DOWN or FLAT!!! 
Start buying CALLs or buying PUTs or selling STRANGLES, but do it!
1989 2018-08-26 17:17:19 Yet here you are, spewing crap at your President talking about stocks.  Shouldn't you be in mourning as you suggested? We think ya should.
1990 2018-08-26 17:16:41 I think everyone is getting the wrong end of the stick here!
Are you speculating on crypto coin market or major innovative business model that applicates a blockchain token of its own designed for purpose? If the latter treat it like business stocks, get in and INVEST!
1991 2018-08-26 17:15:46 Hey Spanky!  People who can't afford stocks don't care. How about "wages at an all time high"?
1992 2018-08-26 17:14:00 the stock is priced in the out years not the current numbers. Has worked in recent years during big run. CRM also has similar pricing along with other high quality game changing stocks. Left is a an idiot who peddles garbage over and over.
1993 2018-08-26 17:10:09 Depends what you got already ? You got stocks my nigga? you fucking wit real estate?
1994 2018-08-26 17:09:37 It’s like this - if you defend Trump because your stocks are doing well or you like the exaggerated (and temporary) tax cuts, then your values are for sale. If you like Trump because he “shakes things up”, then you’re just a fool. #maga? #resist #WalkAway #
1995 2018-08-26 17:09:34 Right, the only problem is, it never trickled down, all this big corporations are buying back stocks and padding executives pockets with more money, workers are still left behind.
1996 2018-08-26 17:09:19 Whenever I come home on weekends my mom stocks up on maple cookies to make me fat
1997 2018-08-26 17:06:58 I want a lot of new ink. I want a lot of new stocks. I want a lot of new shoes. Eh
1998 2018-08-26 17:06:00 La rumeur de pénurie de croquettes pour chats provoque une rupture de stocks. Les consommateurs font des réserves.
1999 2018-08-26 17:05:00 When the market corrects, & it always corrects, will you own that too? Asking for a couple of million ppl whose retirement accounts are tied to stocks.
2000 2018-08-26 17:04:17 Yes, also $auph and, $cwbr. Not good if you got in during the pops... Big pops because small cap stocks.. So I'm sure alot of the subs are hurting... But insiders I'm sure doing well
2001 2018-08-26 17:01:38 In the US military, like the rest of the English speaking world, if we call someone a “trader,” it’s because they buy & sell stocks, bonds, & commodities in their respective financial markets.

John McCain was a naval aviator, congressman, & senator, but he was no trader. 
2002 2018-08-26 16:59:15 These weed stocks tho. $CRON $TRLY
2003 2018-08-26 16:59:15 And it will hit an all time low... that’s what stocks do. STOP DISTRACTING FROM ALL YOUR CORRUPTION. It’s not going away..
2004 2018-08-26 16:54:04 President Trump, thank you for helping the wealthy and turning the swamp into a cesspool filled with your corrupt family and friends. 80% of all stocks are owned by the wealthiest 10%.  So much for championing the "forgotten men and women of our country".
2005 2018-08-26 16:51:58 NEW ARRIVAL!!!

2006 2018-08-26 16:51:57 Kinda want some more stocks but what 
2007 2018-08-26 16:51:26 We considered investing it in Chinese penny stocks
2008 2018-08-26 16:50:20 Many thanks. Let's hope that Cllr Stocks gets the full support of the Torbay Council as they attempt to improve Children's Services. It sounds like a concerted effort is required. Hopefully Cllr Parrott will not be given a similar role?
2009 2018-08-26 16:50:02 Doesn't help anyone but the rich who can afford to buy stocks.  Have to save my pennies for groceries.
2010 2018-08-26 16:48:53 Yes I get the fundamental market forces, on Aim, where most companies have hundreds of millions of penny stocks in issue, margins often in excess of  10%, traditional market forces rarely apply. I think IN this case, we are under the influence of traditional market forces 1of2
2011 2018-08-26 16:48:39 Ma busy lg bya kog naa nay mangabot deliver and if ever mn naay e full out nga stocks
2012 2018-08-26 16:48:38 Please keep Maximum stocks of Poco F1 and kill Black marketing
2013 2018-08-26 16:48:28 Latest illegally produced, illegally researched upon, illegally stockpiled behind the back of their own taxpayers as never have committed themselves to the agreed upon weapon stocks controls as signed up by all 'allies if WW1'. Meaning they lie, cheat, Rob us off our taxes,
2014 2018-08-26 16:47:50 Pls bring enough stocks so that it doesn't get black marketed like other Xiaomi flash sales on inflated prices
2015 2018-08-26 16:47:44 If invested in Blue Chip stocks id stay away from $FB and probs $TWTR . Social media tends to spew alot of negativity which puts the stocks in jeopardy. $AMZN would probs be the only one id go for if I had 1mil. Easy $1k a day with a 100k investment.
2016 2018-08-26 16:47:36 Now small cap at resistance zone...be ready for another good fall in stocks
2017 2018-08-26 16:47:31 10% of the population owns 85% of the stocks. Congrats rich people.
2018 2018-08-26 16:46:38 Thank you man
2019 2018-08-26 16:46:26 Chinese Internet stocks completely out of Favour.
2020 2018-08-26 16:46:20 On the day after the impeachment, after the initial several hundred Dow point drop, buy Stocks.
2021 2018-08-26 16:45:07 Buy stocks where the outlook is not good. -- Walter Schloss
2022 2018-08-26 16:45:07 In equity nothing is long term...if u can't keep track of the stocks buy mutual funds...
2023 2018-08-26 16:44:40 FACT: stocks hit an all time high after news that your CFO turned on you
Disproves your theory that the mkt will crash when you are impeached
2024 2018-08-26 16:43:32 Why do you hate all time high stocks so much? Its almost as if you really don’t care about real progress and just hellbent on being hateful.
2025 2018-08-26 16:43:28 Stocks are a gambling den these days so a high is not always a good thing for a country or it's people. Markets are manipulated and then the rug is pulled and many loose while a few reap a reward. Deregulated wild west.
2026 2018-08-26 16:43:26 The best. Plus, the shoppers below my building stocks it so it makes it that much easier.
2027 2018-08-26 16:43:10 How nice for Americans who own stock.  How many Americans do not hold any stocks?  How many of the top 3% do?
2028 2018-08-26 16:42:50 More than likely former FBI, DOJ and Democrat politicians going to jail. Economics more important to me. My 401k looking great,  I got nice tax cut, bonus, and my stocks looking good too. I trust a business man running country not waffling a politician.
2029 2018-08-26 16:42:03 When have they done this? The game is rigged, you and I are losing. Tariffs & tax cuts will bring economy down. Rich will purchase stocks low. Economy will be brought back by say someone like Clinton did or Obama did, & the value goes up. This decreases your retirement
2030 2018-08-26 16:41:23 @Invest420 got any quick tips for someone that's interested in getting into trading marijuana stocks? #IDontKnowWhatImDoing
2031 2018-08-26 16:41:15 Trump got his headline for the weekend campaign efforts...stocks at all time high.
2032 2018-08-26 16:40:16 The stock market is not the economy.

In fact, because of the tax structuring in this country, stocks at record high is always an easy way to say economic inequality is at record highs.
2033 2018-08-26 16:40:12 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2034 2018-08-26 16:39:51 Good reminder.  Time to buy stocks before the election with upcoming #RedWave2018.  Stocks will plummeted if there is a #BlueWave but I don’t think it will happen.  #EnjoyTheShow 
2035 2018-08-26 16:39:28 My moms financial advisor looked at her crazy when she said she wanted to unload some stocks and buy commodities.

I should take his job but I wont.
2036 2018-08-26 16:39:10 The Council has a lead member for Children's Services who is appointed by the Mayor. This post recently changed with Cllr Stocks an independent replacing Cllr Parrott
2037 2018-08-26 16:37:26 Thank you for your time! I have one last question, if you would create a buy-and-hold portfolio, would you only include cheap stocks or would you think different?
2038 2018-08-26 16:37:08 Indian stocks are giving a sea of opportunity in a foreseeable unprecedented bull run, so many like me feel to own every fundamentally good stocks (though underperforming) and ride the rally ahead.
2039 2018-08-26 16:36:02 Wish u many many happy returns of the @Thekalal may all of your stocks hit UC in coming week !! Happiest Birthday bro !!
2040 2018-08-26 16:35:43 Healthcare is nonexistent, health insurance stocks at 52 week highs ,premiums up 25 percent, with absolutely no coverage, adding 2 trillion in debt every year in your FAKE Economy, The Bubble will BUST!!!
2041 2018-08-26 16:33:06 True. Sloppy of me. What I meant was that if you picked a bunch of stocks, there was a 75% probability that you only picked from the bottom 75%, and if your choices were randomly distributed among those you would get 0% return over the entire quarter century period.
2042 2018-08-26 16:33:02 Mr X. I missed some good stocks like AMD. I Kept waiting for pull back that never happened. Should I just buy them now or get them next time u add?
2043 2018-08-26 16:31:15 Any fool would understand there will be fluctuations in Stirling due to leaving process You could profit by investing in FT100 stocks that have earnings from overseas or invest in gold tied to the US$ - for any financial firm not to advise it's clients would be derelicton of duty
2044 2018-08-26 16:30:32 The only harm to society is to the illegal population, which he's deporting per the law. Black unemployment is down, stocks are up. The only ones complaining still are the Democrats many #WalkAway. Maybe it's time to you starts working with the President ISO against him.

2046 2018-08-26 16:26:45 The only reason Harper had a "balanced budget" was because he sold our GM stocks at a loss.  The cons are not and have never really been the party of fiscal responsibility they would have us believe. #cdnpoli

2048 2018-08-26 16:25:34 Well  Bye, too bad for you.  My stocks have rocked. My pay check is 1000$ more. You must suck at your job, or can’t manage money.

2051 2018-08-26 16:23:05 Happy for those who own stocks, of course.
There are those of us who work everyday without a portfolio (unknown in YOUR world) wishing that all of your blasted "winning" would help us a teeny bit.  Music lessons, braces, groceries, gas. No?
Then go away these are NEEDS not WANTS.
2052 2018-08-26 16:22:42 Most working class people don't even own stocks, and the damage you're causing will inevitably bring us into a depression
2053 2018-08-26 16:22:16 I am. Invest in stocks dummy.
2054 2018-08-26 16:22:15 You do realize that just 54% of us invest in the stock market, either through individual stocks, mutual funds, pensions or retirement plans. Lower-income Americans don't have extra $ to put into stocks, & 1/3 of workers don't have access to a 401(k) or another retirement plan.

2057 2018-08-26 16:20:40 It's unfortunately not that clear cut. Here in NL, we have to cull seals annually to protect fish stocks. But every part is used, Inuit & Innu peoples are a large part of this as well. They make countless seal products from their pelts. Better to be wholly used than wasted.

2060 2018-08-26 16:16:14 Awesome to hear dude. I use both, but I like Stash because it's mutual funds vs. Individual stocks. I have weekly auto withdrawals set up and frankly, you don't really notice it on your bank statements. I'm up 8% since I started over a year ago!

2065 2018-08-26 16:12:03 Well that’s the first time in all the years, 26, of the them. The Stephen Stocks Memorial Shield didn’t go ahead because of the weather. So we’ll try again in September.
2066 2018-08-26 16:11:33 Which stocks do you think will be the biggest winners from this?
2067 2018-08-26 16:11:25 2/ you do decline if you do not have the experience or the skill. You sit, wait and learn. The tories HUMILLIATED us, we consequently became laughing stocks to the public and that's why they will not vote for us.

2070 2018-08-26 16:08:54 Sorry, no. Arsenal are bigger laughing stocks, Dortmund won the league more recently & actually won the UCL final they were in. You're insulting Dortmund by comparing them to Arsenal.
2071 2018-08-26 16:05:47 It’s a strange world of #StockMarket, coz whenever a person sells, another one buys and both of them think that it’s a smart #investment. #jussaying #longestbullrun #shares #stocks #SundayMorning

2078 2018-08-26 15:57:41 Fixes:
Always follow market breadth
No single one stock would cause big trouble
I always have a bunch of stocks in hand
I only buy quality stocks
I only buy pull back or proper buy point
I take profit at 2R or 3R
I always cut loss
I never buy stock in a down trend
2079 2018-08-26 15:57:18 I get paid well above min wage, $15 plus stocks and bonuses for full time employees. that's great for me because i have a family and lots of hobbies i like to do.
2080 2018-08-26 15:57:07 If DeVos wants to arm teachers, why doesn't she sell one of her Cayman Islands tax sheltered Yachts to pay for it? Something tells me she just bought stocks in an arms manufacturer.
2081 2018-08-26 15:54:51 Reasons why I failed in stock investing before.
Do not know market breadth
Do not know position size
Do not diversify
Buying random stocks simply because they breakout
Buy at the climax
Do not take profit
Do not cut loss
Try bottom fishing

2083 2018-08-26 15:50:37 How many Americans actually own stocks?
2084 2018-08-26 15:47:24 The stock market isn't the economy is it!?! lol. I love how they're trying to sell that idea though. The stock market is trading stocks, a company could have high turnover but the stocks are trading poorly and vice versa. more homeless people, more people on the breadline... fact
2085 2018-08-26 15:46:39 26 states passed gun control laws in <5months. Bump stocks banned in 9 states and counting. ~250k voters registered by gun control groups. At this pace, it's only a matter of time, months really, until they take away all your guns.

2088 2018-08-26 15:44:12 By the logic of 2nd point, I don't get into any largecap #FMCG stocks at this time. Market is valuing them as if nothing could go wrong for a generation! Very hard to find value!
2089 2018-08-26 15:44:10 Who cares? Most of us can’t afford stocks. How about fixing stagnant wages? How about providing health care? How about you resign and go live in a cave somewhere?

2091 2018-08-26 15:43:24 We can't have any rule on number of stocks. I simply can have more than 10 good stocks and secondly we can't control many things in the world.
2092 2018-08-26 15:41:13 Easy ways to invest in stocks: stockpile gift cards, 401k thru your employer, IRA thru your bank, online brokerage accounts, various apps. None of these require tons of $$. Let’s get off the menu of capitalism and take our seat at the table! @SXMUrbanView

2096 2018-08-26 15:39:48 Arion has no decision making power on AU. They are strictly investors who bought shares. It's the same as if I bought stocks of Google. On their financial reports, AU is a separate investment than other companies they also have shares in :)

2104 2018-08-26 15:34:14 On the booch! Headed out to get some more as my fridge was full of just nasty alcohol. Stocks have been replenish. You guys are life savers.
2105 2018-08-26 15:33:26 I don't think that's exactly how stocks get valued nowadays. Expectations, clever stories, hope, greed and manipulation have more to do with it than actual performance. Think Tesla. But you're right. Jobs are good for everyone. I'm glad you're doing well and hope it never ends.

2107 2018-08-26 15:31:59 However, wanting to be associated with winners leads many individual investors to systematically underperform the overall stock market. Investors are often drawn to stocks or mutual funds that have outperformed in the recent past and expect that superior performance will continue

Since we r having a REAL RECOVERY w More jobs &wages & salaries go up, the Fed & state govt collect more $ in taxes-for schools, roads, subsidized housing, MEDICAID, govt grants, so ALL THE PEOPLE BENEFIT.

2112 2018-08-26 15:29:17 This tweet is all for the corporate holders. Higher levels of consumer spending is not necessarily a good thing and is often a bad thing leading typical people and families into greater debt. Stocks rising is not overly helpful for the everyday person.

2117 2018-08-26 15:25:51 Trump has benefitted.  Most Americans did not get huge tax cuts like him or hold stocks. Real wages have declined under Trump. The Republicans are attacking unions and eliminating regulations that protect consumers. Not so fantastic.
2118 2018-08-26 15:25:46 Kung ano ano naiisip e mag checheck lang ng stocks !! Hahaha

2123 2018-08-26 15:22:55 Thanks, Obama, for the economic recovery. Thus far, Trump has broken trade deals all over the world, given himself a giant tax break, pocketed money from stocks (that most Americans don't have) and started a trade war. Wages remain stagnant & have declined under Trump.
2124 2018-08-26 15:22:55 Now to invest in some stocks tell me which one I should invest in and go
2125 2018-08-26 15:22:23 If you guys are interested in stocks at all I HIGHLY recommend trading foreign exchange first. The markets are so much faster than stocks so it makes you see patterns before / while they happen
2126 2018-08-26 15:21:58 NASDAQ hit the all time high before anybody says this tweet was a lie

Dow is pogoing mainly due to the big five and energy stocks

Dollar is strong. Silver and gold lower

Classic trends

Buy silver and gold if you have been on the fence 1oz coins are a fair investment now
2127 2018-08-26 15:21:24 Are the dividends any better? No so the price of the stocks have surged and dividends stayed the same means it's all fake!
2128 2018-08-26 15:20:28 I don't consider myself "retail" at all. I consider myself a hard-working man taking care of his family! I get paid above min wage and I also get stocks and bounces as a full-time employee.
2129 2018-08-26 15:19:56 Anyone with internet access has access to buying stocks. All you need to do is work make money and invest.
2130 2018-08-26 15:19:13 Similarly this is the danger of the market, right?  As we see in Little Dorrit and elsewhere, the boom and bust nature of the stocks makes it less stable. Thus, in Nickleby we see a return to a semi-rural retirement.
2131 2018-08-26 15:18:54 Well, I don’t have any stocks, but I can tell you that the price of food, gas, utilities and insurance is going up too!
2132 2018-08-26 15:18:49 you're an idiot. what does that have to do with the economy? 10% of americans own 85% of stocks.
2133 2018-08-26 15:18:19 That’s good and all, too bad the majority of the people in this country ain’t got no stocks!
2134 2018-08-26 15:18:15 YouTube stocks are gonna go down the same way our views did.

My holiness feels it.
2135 2018-08-26 15:17:08 Zero job creation in canada ! Only branch hiring is the federal government while business is RUNNING out of Canada ! Carbon tax , pipelines , ISIS  relations with the U.S at all time low and our trading partners see us as laughing stocks !! We are really on fire here !!
2136 2018-08-26 15:16:00 Check out these scatter charts that compare stocks to bonds to cash. It really emphasizes why you need to have money in stocks.
2137 2018-08-26 15:15:20 True.. And not all bookstores have the same book stocks.. Ada yg kena pegi sampai ke shah alam baru dapat bukunya.. Tp duduk kat area sungai besi.. Online buying costs pon tinggi.. Kalau nak pegi kedai, nak kena ada transport lagi.. Naik public transport? Bukan murah sangat..
2138 2018-08-26 15:15:11 Yes it is. Tax huge tax cuts for the wealthy means the wealthy need somewhere to put the money. When people buy stocks the price goes up. It will fall apart
2139 2018-08-26 15:15:00 Because somebody must buy your stocks when you sell them.
2140 2018-08-26 15:14:52 How nice. People who still have jobs are spending money. Rich folks who live off their stocks are getting richer. I can't tell you how that warms my heart.
With things rolling along so well, how about you get those families reunited before the babies are traumatized beyond repair

2148 2018-08-26 15:09:19 You have to have the means to open a market account most middle class may have what is in their work 401k. But everything else goes to cost of living without room for extras like helping your child through college. Rising stocks mean nothing.
2149 2018-08-26 15:08:38 @WolfOfWeedST want to say thanks for your insight on marijuana stocks. Learned a lot from nothing a year and a half ago. Check out hotels in Vegas down 20-40 percent w/ booming economy...$czr

2151 2018-08-26 15:06:46 The majority of Americans don’t or can’t afford to invest in the stock market. However because of your tax plan for the rich, large corporations are buying back their stocks which benefit them and their shareholders. For the middle class prices rise, gas, food.
2152 2018-08-26 15:05:15 In SC, we’re spending more for the basics. More for water, more for electricity & more for health insurance & out of pocket medical expenses. $150 per child to visit the doctor after a huge increase in our monthly premiums & flood insurance tripled. If only we had stocks.

2158 2018-08-26 15:02:13 Who cares? I can't invest in stocks. I'm just trying to get by with these massive taxes on my head--and go shopping & hope tariffs don't bankrupt me. Go away.
2159 2018-08-26 15:00:16 Well, booyah. In the very least the top 1% richest Americans who own 40% of the stocks in the DOW are grateful that you, the king of chapter 11's are helping them rape the US Treasury. 2 trillion added to the US DEBT since you hired Russian hacks to steal an election.
2160 2018-08-26 14:58:52 Stock market is doing good because the rich is now richer and buying stocks!! Everyone else still fucked!!
2161 2018-08-26 14:58:29 I'm sure that's good news for all the wealthy people that own stocks.
2162 2018-08-26 14:58:01 MY STOCKS ARE UP 
2163 2018-08-26 14:56:18  stocks are not a good representation of your countries success. They will always gain in the long run. Well past when you are gone next month
2164 2018-08-26 14:55:15 Hm....you don't invest into the stocks with your 401k? Not all for the wealthy!!
2165 2018-08-26 14:55:07 For stocks, 1% advance on volume > 3% over yday volume. For indices, 0.30% advance. An indicator of buying pressure #stocks
2166 2018-08-26 14:53:59 Too bad most Americans don’t own stocks.
2167 2018-08-26 14:53:52 There's a reason it's my ex-occupation. I chose to leave it. and the few who do that kind of crap should be in prison...or put in stocks for the public to deal with.
2168 2018-08-26 14:52:54 Gotta jump in on these marijuana stocks before the Q4
2169 2018-08-26 14:52:26 It's not a value increase of 3%. The stock values could've risen or fallen by much more. The 3% rise is a stat about the proportion of stocks owned by that group. It doesn't indicate anything about purchasing power.
2170 2018-08-26 14:52:08 Sure. Corporate stocks went up. How does that help the little guys?
2171 2018-08-26 14:49:31 Its not how it came out, he ask a legit question a player being good has nothing to do with the character being unbalanced or op. Some people say just sdi, but myran is asking that if thats true then why do top players keep getting robbed of their stocks by bayos BS.
2172 2018-08-26 14:49:18 I don't own stocks, my neighbors don't own stocks. What we want are fair wages and to avoid the recession you are escorting in. You are so far out of touch with the average American that you have no idea how meaningless your tweets bragging on yourself really are. #DonTheCon
2173 2018-08-26 14:48:46 Only the rich have stocks. Tax break to the 1% is the cause of better stocks. Every day Americans will pay a price in the long run
2174 2018-08-26 14:47:28 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your insomnia
2175 2018-08-26 14:47:22 Seriously? All this means it the people who can afford to buy stocks got richer. It does Zero to help the middle class or the poor. ZERO
2176 2018-08-26 14:47:13 You can give the best stock market advice on #twitter, but the real question is how are your own trading results? #NoDaysOff #DayTrading #SwingTrading #Stocks #StockMarket

Real wages are down.

 Blue collar, real people do not profit off stocks, only MILLIONAIRES & BILLIONAIRES!
2183 2018-08-26 14:42:30 Here's what will do him in: When they find out that the real Kompromat is that Russia gave trump info (via Saudis) pre-9/11 that allowed him to buy/sell specific real estate/stocks. Rather than warn anyone about the terrorist plot, he used to info that make a fortune.

2187 2018-08-26 14:40:23 I appreciate your generic reply but I doubt anything will be done about it. You should invest in a decent gaming section. One that stocks the latest games. Enniskillen has no game shops you could easily benefit for putting more effort into this area!! #ForGamers #DoMore
2188 2018-08-26 14:39:34 Atulji  should the number of stocks be according to the amount of portfolio or it should be 10 only. Kindly reply so that I should rejig my portfolio.
2189 2018-08-26 14:37:57 Stock markets go up and down.  New all time high July 2007 at 14,500. Two years later at 6,500 down 60%. Oops. You think Deplorables own stocks?  Get real. It’s top 10% that owns 90% is all stocks
2190 2018-08-26 14:37:55 Hahahaha I see you made it down 
2191 2018-08-26 14:37:46 Having Jamal as a loan player paid off, I guess Stocks would have expected to play.

How is Stocks anyway? Anyone know, treat shit by Brum...
2192 2018-08-26 14:36:44 If Team Wang is going to release a photobook they better make sure they have enough stocks. Cjackys alone could buy million copies.
2193 2018-08-26 14:34:59 So your rich friends are getting richer!   Regular people don't own stocks. The stock market was helped by your tax cut. Most of the corporations, bought back their owns stocks, instead of sharing their tax cut with their employees. Which in turn, made them even richer!#TaxScam
2194 2018-08-26 14:34:45 I'm bullish too. On certain stocks. 
Respectfully I think your focus areas -- at least what you highlight -- as a financial advisor running a big book, are way out to lunch on the  risk curve now. 
Unless this is all pure entertainment of course.
2195 2018-08-26 14:33:49 McCain killed 113 of his own men when he drop a bomb on deck. Was shot down cuz he broke formations flew to low.
2196 2018-08-26 14:33:42 are you out of your mind? I think Ross is everything everyone says he is, just a self promoting simpleton doing well in a bull market of child theme stocks: tsla appl googl etc. but people dont get this:billionaires dont go to jail (musk) and Ross isn't even going to be fined
2197 2018-08-26 14:33:02 10 percent of the country owns 85 percent of stocks held in America
2198 2018-08-26 14:33:00 That’s because the people you made richer are buying into their own stocks and artificially inflating the market. This can’t be sustained and it will come crashing down. It will be your fault but you will blame everyone else.

2206 2018-08-26 14:28:33 I’m still bullish even with a trump impeachment. Stocks rallied to new ATH. We think that’s bullish too. We have a few months of politics ahead with the election. Democrats take the House. Gridlock the Trump administration from any more dumb moves. I like this scenario. #stocks
2207 2018-08-26 14:26:56 Obama Care has ruined this county and a complete scam! Since being made law Americans deductibles have doubled or tripled, and insurance companies stocks prices have gone up over 200%. Absolutely disgusting

2218 2018-08-26 14:15:18 He said that as US is in a trade war & so disruptions to the economy is being managed by Trump's team & the markets trust. If it crumbles, yes the stocks may crash because of uncertainty. About revolting then y'all folk been doing it since day 1. So nothing new in that.

2221 2018-08-26 14:11:08 Couldn’t agree more - except at this point it’s also being used as a store of value and a diversifier of assets. But at least you can sit in this - the same can’t be said for stocks and bonds!
2222 2018-08-26 14:10:33 One of the main limiting factors on seed potato production is viruses transmitted by aphids etc. Historically almost all UK seed spuds were grown in Scotland as it was too cold for the aphids - this has changed a bit since we became able to test seed stocks for viruses directly.

2233 2018-08-26 14:02:35 ? Trumps the one saying if he’s impeached the stocks will collapse and people will “revolt” for him. Idk what’s worse than a bunch of entitled white people roaming the streets with guns lmfaoooooo y’all humor me

2235 2018-08-26 14:00:32 The data and analysis are very interesting. But comparing something to its historical price doesn’t make em cheap or expensive; ie Stocks today, or Japan govt bonds. Underlying reality behind the data, numbers and means matter too. Can’t say cheap for blue collar to buy homes.

2252 2018-08-26 13:42:05 Fear-mongering garbage.They told us in the US that we would immediately be thrown into another great depression if Trump was elected.

2253 2018-08-26 13:42:03 I've read that tweet five times now (about six more than it deserved) and I still have no idea what years were the good ones

2268 2018-08-26 13:23:58 For ordinary Americans, the stock market is not an indicator of economic well-being. The wealthiest 10% of Americans own 84% of stocks.

2275 2018-08-26 13:15:23 Bump stocks are a joke and are no longer manufactured. You can also buy 2000 lbs of fertilizer and mix it with fuel oil. 

Bad people will do bad things regardless of laws, they will find the way. A rubber band is as good as a bump stock in simulating full auto.
2276 2018-08-26 13:10:59 I too have higher risk appetite compare to others as I used to trade stocks and based it on fundamentals. Right not, Bitcoin is definitely a game of accumulation. Waiting for months and years, is not an easy task, but for sure those who can will be rewarded big time for sure.
2277 2018-08-26 13:10:58 Stocks put 2017 in the behind.
2278 2018-08-26 13:10:42 I agree with first sentence. But, saying most people don't have access to stock market is false. Very easy to open an online brokerage account and trade stocks no matter where in America you live.
2279 2018-08-26 13:09:03 It is still passive investing as the index determines the stocks you are holding not the other way round.
2280 2018-08-26 13:08:44 94 consecutive months of job growth, 19 under Trump. Stocks bottomed March 9, 2009. Recovery began July, 2009. This is just an extension of a nearly decade-long event. Tax cuts added only to profits. The under-withholding of taxes this year (GAO) will be a story/problem in 2019.

2291 2018-08-26 13:01:11 The press is now the enemy of the people -- this is a simple answer for me. 
Look at the lies they've perpetrated in the past few years. 
Look back longer and you'll see a trail of lies. 
They think they control how we think, but they don't. 

Media stocks plunge.

2301 2018-08-26 12:54:57 Here’s one of my favorite little gems from the article: “Mr. Rahn was selling stocks in small batches multiple times a day. In April 2017, he sold between 75 and 125 shares of Exxon eight times in one day, rather than all at once, generating commissions on each sale.”

2305 2018-08-26 12:49:11 This time it's different

2306 2018-08-26 12:48:24 I feel like it's easier to lay in stocks of currency, as they don't need to fit a person? Although I feel like a interesting story lies in destabilising of currencies by wildly spending chrononauts.
2307 2018-08-26 12:45:12 Maybe because we hold moral values that just happen to be superior to the SA government (ie NOT killing innocent people), how this will severely impact food stocks in SA, and how the South African economy will collapse if this goes through.

2326 2018-08-26 12:26:38 I bet they won’t ban bump stocks
2327 2018-08-26 12:25:46 Sorry to hear, hopefully we can stop it before then! All I can say, is that if it does happen, I’d think about building up your own food stocks, just in case. It’s a ridiculous situation. #StopBrexit
2328 2018-08-26 12:24:28 .. is how it goes.  Did you expect a drop from $0.97 to $0.67/sh for URG?  No.  But it happened.  This is how stocks work.  So, the message is in the end how will your or my or any one's preferences do.  But not in one 2 month period and ignore the rest.  That is stupid.
2329 2018-08-26 12:22:57 If you can’t figure it out, there’s little you can be taught.  Most Americans are significantly invested in the markets through their 401k plans.  As for the correlation between stocks of public companies and a capitalist economy...probably anathema to a socialist.
2330 2018-08-26 12:22:43 Ah i see. It’s still amazing you have so many green days. So do you just focus on stocks at the open and get in at the match direction for a scalp or do you wait for confirmation of a trend then get in a trade? Cheers
2331 2018-08-26 12:21:45 Financial conditions are easing because QT creates flow back to US assets. That flow pushes stocks up and yields down, easing conditions.
2332 2018-08-26 12:21:35 Sir how to control theta & delta?
2333 2018-08-26 12:20:10 Sorry. Equities is a term for stocks as it reflects ownership in companies. A home equity is a loan leveraged against your ownership in your home.
2334 2018-08-26 12:19:02 ... if you look at the assets owned it is going to be in working assets like stocks, land, etc. Very little in cash. BTW the vast majority of what ppl think of as cash is really debt that must be repaid with interest to Central Banks. Keep digging,  we never stop learning.

2343 2018-08-26 12:10:58 It’s amazing how even the tiniest measure of gun control is vigorously opposed by the NRA. IDK much about firearms, so I’m asking—is there a legit reason to use bump stocks  besides killing a lot of people quickly. If that’s the only purpose, banning them should be a no-brainer.
2344 2018-08-26 12:10:22 Buy bonds. Stocks are suspect.
2345 2018-08-26 12:08:49 UUUU had a nice run after their cash raise and V2O5 comments.  URG did really nice and pulled back huge.  This is what stocks do.  So, say you buy & sell & buy again.

2350 2018-08-26 11:54:18 The stock market is being artificially sustained by the 1% (GOP buddies)who are the ones who OWN the stocks and manipulate the masses at their whims. Not to mention the rich in foreign countries who also own stocks. They are not ready for it to crash just yet. They are in control
2351 2018-08-26 11:54:17 All shareholders need to cash out their stocks in my opinion.
2352 2018-08-26 11:52:48 Capitalism isn't the problem . Greed is the problem. Safra Catz ,CEO OF ORACLE,  made $250 million dollars selling back her stocks ( buy back) due to Trump /GOP tax cuts Minimum wage in Florida is around $8.25. Real wage increase for the middle class is only 2.7%.
2353 2018-08-26 11:52:13 Ya its bouncing from its 50 EMA.. but its still below its 200 EMA..  i would generally wait for stocks to close above 200 to start trading or investing in them... Stocks generally give a lot of false breakouts below 200 ema...
2354 2018-08-26 11:51:20 My two cents : while cash stocks and futures have a linear payoff , options has a non linear payoff graph . To understand this nonlinearity , Greeks is essential . My trades are based on charts , but since positions are structured in options , I use Greeks for that

2356 2018-08-26 11:47:30 These figures include  fish which live beyond the boundaries of UK waters, such as Arctic cod & west of Ireland sole. If one considers the 73 different fish stocks which live in UK waters, the total EU quota was 1,920,915 tonnes, of which 585,211 tonnes was allocated to uk (30%)
2357 2018-08-26 11:46:35 In 2015, the CFP allocated the United Kingdom a total of 612,612 tonnes of quota from more than 100 different fish and shellfish stocks. The total EU quota for these stocks was 2,069,202 tonnes, so the UK was allocated 30% of these fish (and shellfish) quotas.

2367 2018-08-26 11:39:52 I just learned that Central Banks of other countries can buy US stocks. It is not legal for the US Federal Reserve to buy stocks. But other countries can print money and buy our stocks. What a house of cards. Potential blackmail. Other countries can cause a US market crash.
2368 2018-08-26 11:38:06 You have no clue about finance/economics.  The DOW is a price weighted index of 30 stocks.  The founder believed, but 100 years later, it is nothing indicative of the market.  Cap weighted are better.  Just shows you are fixated with Dow just like a baby is fixated teether.

2402 2018-08-26 10:40:56 It's the EU that needs to take a look at its common fisheries policy, once we are out of the EU we can look at a more sustainable way to catch fish and put in place an ecological system which will help maintain fish stocks

2411 2018-08-26 10:33:29 I watched it after I tweeted. thing is, we know about fish stocks.i remember a time when all of the wildlife documentaries were a pleasure to watch. interesting insights into their lives. but now, every wildlife documentary is about their going extinct. 
2412 2018-08-26 10:32:17 Great advice and that rule applies for 99% of otc stocks . But not bvtk . This stock is going places . Fact is if this was a junk stock it would have been done a long time ago . But it won’t die and that should tell everyone that this is a for real stock.

2436 2018-08-26 09:58:38 I think there is a lot of potential in aquaculture to rebuild our fishery in ways that protect harvesters from a changing ocean climate but we need strong environmental regulations on any project to ensure that we don't hurt the wild stocks and bays

2446 2018-08-26 09:38:48 There might be a company with 5000 crore market cap but free float around 4000 crore, and a stock with 10k crores market cap but free float of 4000 crore..In this case still the free float less then 5000 crore valid for both the stocks?
2447 2018-08-26 09:38:44 I was initially only coming for a day so didn’t think it was worth mentioning. Found a way to eke it out til Thursday though :)
2448 2018-08-26 09:36:29 That’s not right, though, @SheldenHilary. I ate dry rice and oats with water and rode an old bicycle for years so that I could buy stocks and save. I don’t expect everyone to do that, but we don’t need to be told that our concerns don’t matter. I want the same things you do.

2462 2018-08-26 09:13:11 ISIS was not involved in the #LasVegasShooting. All Paddock did was rent out a corner room/lot, purchased legal AR15s, added bump stocks to imitate an assault rifle, fired out a window and murdered a bunch of people. There's no secret Saudi gun deal or ISIS connections.

2477 2018-08-26 08:55:25 1. Russia is a threat to global order which directly threatens the US.
2. They need an enemy for when the economy tanks (not stocks) and they need to distract the public with some form of war to prove that "life is still great we're protecting you from the Russians".

2516 2018-08-26 08:09:27 Agreed, but note that *human* stocks (like business) are most of the few to lack (or ignore) neg. loops that may stabilize them. "Endless" accumulation is not possible, but the attempt and subseq. overshoot-and-collapse is, apart from cancer cells and few spec. situations, human
2517 2018-08-26 08:08:52 Which village idiot was that? Put them in the stocks. Tar and feather her them.
2518 2018-08-26 08:00:38 What I do is check price action first and then try and find out fundamentals after that. 
As price is leading indicator and fundamentals lagging.
I have experienced that stocks with changing fundamentals have a better chance of superior performance with lower drawdowns.

2537 2018-08-26 07:23:04 Totally agree, most of the Central Banks are buying up MASSIVE amounts of stocks, a lot of the tech stocks. Billions of dollars worth.
2538 2018-08-26 07:22:10 Food for thought....Seeing more #Bashers discover twitter. Not only is $HMNY targeted, so are many others. They must keep in mind, they are not protected on here as they are on a mesaage board!

2540 2018-08-26 07:18:38 Oh. Sorry I misinterpreted. I totally agree to your statement. Best stocks are one which is within the circle of influence.
2541 2018-08-26 07:17:02 Where’d you get those numbers? Pretty sure a good portion of the population invests (or at least has the option to) in stocks through mutual funds in their employer-sponsored retirement plans (IRA, 401k, etc)

2543 2018-08-26 07:15:48 Hi sir 1 sme stocks would like to know about dhabriya polywood .
2544 2018-08-26 07:13:55 Yes, congrats to the extremely wealthy for artificially inflating stocks with stock buybacks with the extra money from the tax scam so that the market can crash. Bubbles burst, and it's we  the regular non rich, that end up paying for it while CEOs get golden parachute bailouts.
2545 2018-08-26 07:12:30 That’s great! If you haven’t already, invest in your employer’s IRA/401k..it’s usually the best way to buy stocks as part of a mutual fund (at least that’s the way most of them work)
2546 2018-08-26 07:10:24 yeah, there's a huge difference between trading stocks and deploying millions of dollars worth of infrastructure.  but stick to your guns, it's what makes you so cute.
2547 2018-08-26 07:08:51 Individual stocks, you’re probably right. However, a good many DO have stocks as part of their retirement plans through their employer..they’re usually purchased in mutual funds.

2551 2018-08-26 07:02:48 I prefer stocks with 1-2% yield that stays constant despite stock giving a 20-30% CAGR. 

Pure yield with no capital gains over the years is like food without (low) salt!!

Only few sectors in the economy will give you above over long time periods.

2553 2018-08-26 06:56:14 Most employers have a retirement plan in which employees can invest in stocks through mutual funds.
2554 2018-08-26 06:56:08 Yes. That's the point. There's a HUGE difference between investing in stocks vs the index.

2556 2018-08-26 06:55:28 Bump stocks... the NRA mumbled something might need to be done about them. Chris Cox, the NRA's million-dollar point man on legislative actions later told a gun dealer - on tape - they just said that to stall a bill that had momentum.
2557 2018-08-26 06:54:46 Most employers have a retirement plan in which you can contribute into it and buy stocks through mutual funds.

2561 2018-08-26 06:44:31 But Asad’s track record with stocks & bonds oozes of failure and so I simply won’t go near these diaspora bonds with my hard-earned cash and (as an objective professional) would advise others not to do so either if they value their money.
2562 2018-08-26 06:43:14 hahahaha that's the real bubble. if you watch the markets, nobody makes any money accept the huge players. if you buy a couple of stocks from a company, you'd be lucky to make 20 bucks. more for restricting, not trading. join the crypto side.

2590 2018-08-26 06:03:24 Thanks for sharing. Question - What drove your thinking on a position size model? Appears you take relatively small posns in a large quantity of stocks. Curious your thought process, or did prior experience warrant this? Have you tried sizing up with fewer holdings?
2591 2018-08-26 06:03:18 Why aren't U.S.A. workers getting a wage increase to keep pace with inflation after you bought off the rich and made them richer with tax cuts for the upper class Trump? Just because they're reinvesting it in stocks in their own companies is no reason to congratulate the U.S.A.!

Don’t follow equity research firms. Be vary of operator-driven stocks. Don’t diversify too much- Invest in limited stocks with good fundamentals. It is said that going long term maximises wealth but not always- book profit on regular intervals. #nse #stocks

2667 2018-08-26 04:02:51 I lost $15,000 of my investment with @peabodycoal , but the bankruptcy court let all the senior staff transfer their stocks! They screwed the little guy! I guess they are just continuing their legacy! I was trying to support a coal come back

2672 2018-08-26 03:54:18 You may find his, or the motley fools, online subscription more useful if you’re ready to invest in stocks/etfs. I see his book as an intro to getting your life sorted. (I subscribe and have had issues with his misogyny before. He’s very “herald sun”. But the stock stuff is good)
2673 2018-08-26 03:50:12 What the media did cover about the financial markets meltdown in 2008, they didn’t know how to assess. But flipping off the GM bond holders was a terribly destructive thing to do. The same happened with FHLMC and FNMA stocks, a lot of which was also owned in pensions.

2678 2018-08-26 03:42:37 GDP is a cute little talking point but there are other indicators to the economy. Most consecutive months of job growth in recorded history, unemployment from 10% down to 4%, stocks at all time high. Stick to your little talking point. Just like trump all show no action!

Stocks are bought not in fear but in hope. They are typically sold out of fear. – Justin Mamis 
 #TradersDoItSitting
2687 2018-08-26 03:33:06 Looks like the main aim of all powerful people of the world is to keep stock market moving on the upside irrespective of anything! 

Print notes and let the stocks go up!

2709 2018-08-26 03:18:17 So you actually believe tripling the stock market is less relevant than current market that is being propped up by companies merely buying back their own stocks. That being said, stock market is not an indicator of economy. Just means wealthy are getting richer.

2721 2018-08-26 03:10:06 Why did pharmaceutical stocks soar the day after you announced your drug reform policy?
2722 2018-08-26 03:09:53 This is high-beta stuff--I would guesstimate that 10% SPX decline will take prices of these stocks/ETFs down, on average, to strike prices of the puts. At that point, your $100K outlay gives you exposure to further declines on $2,2M worth of high-beta, cyclical/leveraged stocks.

2751 2018-08-26 02:44:42 Most Americans don't own stocks. The CEOs u gave tax breaks to did not invest in people, they bought more stocks. So they benefit.
2752 2018-08-26 02:44:30 A whopping 84% of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10% of households. So, congratulate to the 10% of wealthiest of Americans. 
2753 2018-08-26 02:43:42 The only millionaires and billionaires are those who own stocks and valuable property. And in the U,S.A. It seems only 10% own any stocks which also includes what it held inside of pensions.

2761 2018-08-26 02:35:25 I don’t feel like getting into a back & forth but I’ll say this.Obama’s 8 years were the worst for law enforcement officers (LEO). His lack of support & disrespect towards us was pathetic. As for the Dow-I have stocks.Not sure where u got that chart but mine only moved up w/ DJT
2762 2018-08-26 02:33:50 The market was a bit over 18k right before election. You miss the point. The previous administration tripled it. The economy has long trended up. After tax cuts, companies have been propping up the market by buying back their own stocks. The market is not an indicator of economy.

2774 2018-08-26 02:28:05 There are two types of cheater entries I use to get in pre-breakout while price forms the right side of a base: 1) a break of a prior swing high formed on the left or right side, and 2) on a pullback (preferred) #stocks

2777 2018-08-26 02:22:49 I've invested at times in my life. Did options in the 80s. Got the quick success with first trades things like calls on the Yen & gold then promptly got talked into losing all my gains and then some on other trades. I have bought stocks since but not been a steady investor
2778 2018-08-26 02:22:44 The DOW has on 30 stocks in it while the S&P 500 has 500 stocks in it. Nobody who pays serious attention to the financial markets thinks the DOW is a better indicator of the markets than the S&P.  Only the uninformed public thinks the DOW is the market.
2779 2018-08-26 02:22:06 Would be nice if we didn’t have to pay for nonviolent offenders in jail. It’s sad that people like Jeff Seesions profit from the sale of humans to private prisons with publicly held stocks so that messes can also profit from the sale of humans

2786 2018-08-26 02:18:36 I've never seen anything like this. No one has ever seen anything like this. Expect unusual behavior! My wife mentioned Musk to a guy who works with her two weeks ago; they've never talked about stocks or companies before. He just smiled and said: "He's as big a liar as Trump."
2787 2018-08-26 02:17:40 I wouldn't go out of my way, unless he found himselfs pilloried or in the stocks, in which case I'd take the time to chuck some rotten vegetables at fat, jowly face. Nothing against PP (ponderous people), but he's simply the most offensive walking hemorrhoid on the planet,

2801 2018-08-26 02:02:09 It constantly goes up with time. It has been flat now for several months since you started a trade war. 80 percent of stocks are owned by the top ten percent
2802 2018-08-26 02:01:30 Eso si. A lo q iba es q no hay un dilema flujos vs stocks como dice mieli aun con mismos flujos y 100k palos era otra historia
2803 2018-08-26 02:00:21 Is it any surprise at all that dismantling regulations and oversight has the stocks doing well?  But we are losing lives. Real people die from lack of regulations. 1400 people mean nothing so the rich get richer?  That's wrong.  It's a house or cards.
2804 2018-08-26 01:58:25 Great, the wealthy are again happy. The top 20% of Americans own 80% of the stocks traded in the stock market, and are the ones that benefit.
2805 2018-08-26 01:58:23 I finna buy some stocks & bonds.
2806 2018-08-26 01:57:50 Hmmmm. I was a banker, am currently a revenue analyst, invest in stocks and crypto. BTC will see an ETF... in time.
2807 2018-08-26 01:56:59 I follow a simple strategy of owning stocks that are above the 200d, buying them as close to the 200d as possible. Some in an uptrend that have pulled back, and some that are recovering from a beat down and are rising from below.
2808 2018-08-26 01:55:05 The average Americans don’t own stocks or gives a shit about stocks.
2809 2018-08-26 01:54:39 Congratulations to all those rich enough to own lots of stocks!
2810 2018-08-26 01:53:03 Think back when Pierre Trudeau brought in UI for seasonal workers. Suddenly thousands in the Maritime provinces became fishermen and were eligible for UI. That was the start of the decimation of the cod stocks.
2811 2018-08-26 01:52:12 DUDE ME TOO. I tell people this is how I know how stocks work because of trading bottled fairies in the neopian market!! HEJDHDJDJDJD A KINDRED SOUL.
2812 2018-08-26 01:51:07 Woodhull Auto Supply Hobby Stocks (20 laps): JOE BIRDSALL 63, Les Smith 8x, AJ Neidermairer 73, Brandon Birdsall 28, Brent Williams 21
2813 2018-08-26 01:51:01 My recommendation... dont invest anything in any stocks until you've studied for a while. Invest in your education. Itll save you in the long run from paying more in market dues. Also, and this is just my opinion, trying to start with just $200 is way more difficult. Good luck!
2814 2018-08-26 01:50:59 Because this is certainly the night to celebrate high stocks
2815 2018-08-26 01:50:27 Renewable energy stocks will be a good investment, with steady returns, for a long time. It’s a quantum shift.
2816 2018-08-26 01:49:48 Stop gambling with stocks and get informed on where to really put your money..
2817 2018-08-26 01:48:59 
2818 2018-08-26 01:48:38 "Concern" is for paranoids and hypochondriacs - I just watch the stocks and they keep going higher: $ROKU, $FNKO, $SFIX, $ZS, $CSX, $AAPL, etc. and new ones joining the party: $NVDA, $SPLK, $ADSK, $ANET, etc...
2819 2018-08-26 01:48:36 Jackie is stab without DAW stocks .   
2820 2018-08-26 01:48:31 @RooksLeAnne Did you ever get some $SENS stock? I've been buying small lots on a weekly basis. Following similar patterns to what we're familiar with MNKD and other biotech stocks.
2821 2018-08-26 01:47:45 What a surprise! People with more money own more stocks.
2822 2018-08-26 01:47:30 Chat Mobility Hobby Stocks: Luke Ramsey picks up his 10th win of the season!
2823 2018-08-26 01:45:12 Trump spends money on who? 83%of the #GOPTaxScam went to the heirs & Corporations. The rest fight for crumbs they'll pay back in2yrs while rich are permanent & double dip #stocks buy backs,no salary increases,no job increase that wasn't already on track thanks to Obama recovery.
2824 2018-08-26 01:43:45 apple stocks rise by 20%.
2825 2018-08-26 01:43:36 I say buy Facebook and Twitter stocks then sell it fast and drop their stocks in the tank.
It's worth it to spank them.
2826 2018-08-26 01:42:57 The most insane thing about all this shit, be it stocks, RE, art, or even rare car market, it’s all predicated in 5000 year lows in the cost of capital, does that sound logically sustainable?
2827 2018-08-26 01:42:23 Obama was elected AFTER the market crashed! We don’t have to agree about the current, or past President, but we must have the facts correct. The stocks have been rising for over 3000 days!
2828 2018-08-26 01:41:39 Great! I can buy tobacco stocks on the cheap. Impeach Impeach Impeach! Gr8 dividend play

2832 2018-08-26 01:32:02 Didn't get anything from the stock market in my pocket, or anywhere else. You DO realize that a low percentage of people even have stocks, NO MONEY to put in a stock. You gave all the money to the rich people, remember. When it falls, you've got to claim it too you know!
2833 2018-08-26 01:31:55 I don’t own any stocks.
2834 2018-08-26 01:30:52 Season championship here @BooneSpeedway tonight. Running mod lights, hobby stocks, sport mods, stock cars and modifieds in that order. That’s the way it should always be #oldschool
2835 2018-08-26 01:30:12 Very true! Loss aversion or ego of not selling below the purchase price/ urge of lowering the buy price in low quality stocks leads to much bigger opportunity loss.
Retail investors typically end up making lowest returns than any asset class due to this bias.
2836 2018-08-26 01:29:54 The tax cuts did not help the average man nor will more tax cuts. However, corporate tax cuts allowed some business to buy back stocks which increased valuations. Big business expanded nationwide creating job growth, however those jobs offered lower than average pre 2008 wages.
2837 2018-08-26 01:29:11 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
2838 2018-08-26 01:28:18 Leaving funds on an exchange dosnt centralize the wealth any more then me leaving stocks in my accounts at banks do.
2839 2018-08-26 01:26:57 I’ve been teaching my close friends about stocks and it’s so fun 
If any of y’all wanna learn lmk and make that SHMONEY
2840 2018-08-26 01:26:28 Coming from a guy that stocks his fridge with Coors? Ha!
2841 2018-08-26 01:23:45 I see your Walmart stocks from the same nursery ours does, haha. Those tags are actually helpful, when they've got the proper name on them.
2842 2018-08-26 01:23:27 You are ridiculous, leading your blind followers to bankruptcy while you illegally naked short stocks is ridiculous. I still have an old video of you and the fake madmoney man explaining how you play the market and game the system to get rich while people lose all their savings!
2843 2018-08-26 01:19:40 Have you done it with an untreated sinus infection and bronchitis from Alaska to North Carolina? Because I’m pretty sure the stocks would be easier. You’re definitely on to something.
2844 2018-08-26 01:18:31 You’re dead wrong. Clinton’s impeachment was over an irrelevant behavior. He was popular. Trump is not popular. Just his base. No accomplishments. Stocks have been going up for 8 years. Wages stagnant. Dems energized. This is BS.
2845 2018-08-26 01:18:14 Congratulations to corporations buying back their own stocks upping their investments! Not the people!
2846 2018-08-26 01:17:39 #Racist tweets again

Good job

I see why @Jack loves seeing the stocks shorted

Happy to see that happen again

2847 2018-08-26 01:16:27 You should have come out for Painter Al, we are stuck with that mouse of a senator Tina Smith! Not only is she corrupt with her medical device stocks, she will pollute our water with polynet. You know it, Run against her next time, we need you back
2848 2018-08-26 01:16:20 Wages are low, stocks are high, divide between class wider then ever, congratulations us.
2849 2018-08-26 01:16:10 Forget necklaces and rings , gift me with shares and stocks to a multimillion company . 
2850 2018-08-26 01:14:39 “dark money” comes from central banks. ..central banks “print” money or electronically fabricate money by buying bonds or stocks. They use other tools like adjusting interest rate policy and currency agreements with other central banks to pump liquidity into the financial system.
2851 2018-08-26 01:13:43 apple stocks rise by 10%.
2852 2018-08-26 01:13:22 Unrelated to the question but turkey necks make for good stocks and gravy

Have me invest in the correct stocks and then bring young me here (She’ll love modern cellphone & gadgets). I don’t mind stepping aside for her. She deserves the best. Confusing? Yeah!
2855 2018-08-26 01:11:28 New trends ‘always’ emerge during a bear market -  that’s when most investors are either waiting for their purchase price or averaging the sins from the stocks bought during the previous bull market. #TheThoughtfulInvestor
2856 2018-08-26 01:08:48 Hey dumb m*********** anyone who has a 401k is invested in the stocks most working-class people have a 401k even Walmart workers have 401 case they're invested in stocks take your socialist b******* and shove it up your ass

2860 2018-08-26 01:05:38 Thanks to tech stocks. In truth, some of the market struggled on Friday, mainly due to your capricious "leadership."
2861 2018-08-26 01:05:30 Arjun is a serpopard who trades stocks for fun.
2862 2018-08-26 01:02:43 WOW! Now that was the riskiest move ever. It’s not like stocks are ever guaranteed and he did say “considering” not I AM TAKING. It their own foolishness for being so aggressive and expecting a 100% guarantee. I bought extra when it was mulch lower thinking well “maybe”

2867 2018-08-26 01:00:02 You don't get how this works, do you? The only people who benefit from stocks are the wealthy. There is no "trickle down." What investors use for 401k can be decimated in an afternoon, but the rich will still be rich.
2868 2018-08-26 00:59:16 Doesn’t matter if they ‘directly’ own stocks. If they have a 401K, savings acct, health care acct, college fund, or IRA, they own stocks.
2869 2018-08-26 00:57:36 Eighty five percent of those stocks are owned by the top ten percent! No raise in my paycheck! Property taxes are not deductible! GOP TAX SCAM WAS FUNDED BY BORROWING MONEY! Traitor!Resign!
2870 2018-08-26 00:57:24 Or put them all in stocks on the Washington Mall so we can all throw rotten fruit at them every day! Present day punishments in white collar jail just won't do for their overthrow of our Govt!!
2871 2018-08-26 00:57:00 I research the markets everyday for a living, sir. Corporate earnings have been higher across the board, which boosts share values of stocks in the retirement accounts of all Americans. 2017-18 has seen growth obviously driven by Trump’s policies whether you like him or not
2872 2018-08-26 00:55:06 @callemKingJames how are your stocks?
2873 2018-08-26 00:53:57 Am I the only one who stocks up my pasta based on "oooh this one looks fun."? Also, go shells or go home.

This tweet brought to you by the radiatore cooking on my stove.
2874 2018-08-26 00:53:47 Corporations buying back their own stock with your tax cuts.  Making their stocks over valued.   It's going to crash Pig.  and stay away from McCain's funeral.  Your not fit to be there.

2888 2018-08-26 00:44:15 Of course the stock market is way up. Remove regulations requiring corporations to look out for the public. Cut taxes, without requiring the money be put back to employees. Reduce individual taxes on executive level salary. Stocks up, population way down. Gonna burst soon IMO
2889 2018-08-26 00:41:58 I was checking my stocks in the Wall Street Journal and saw this story, chuckled, poured me a drink and toasted the #POTUS.
2890 2018-08-26 00:40:32 the richest 10% of Americans own ~84% of all stocks. Why congratulate 100% of Americans? What are you doing for the other 90% @realDonaldTrump !?
2891 2018-08-26 00:40:23 To you "USA" is comprised of the rich people who have stocks. Meanwhile I dug a cereal box out of the trash cause it had a "box top" for education worth .10 cents for public schools. Go to hell.

2896 2018-08-26 00:39:17 You want fries with that?

1) The top 20% own 80% of stocks.
2) Strawman assertion. Companies whose stock price is doing 'well' have no reason to create jobs, in fact buy back stock to drive prices up.
3) Unemployment numbers do NOT reflect income.
2897 2018-08-26 00:39:01 Seriously? You are so cold hearted! You talk about stocks when an American hero passed. Good job you
2898 2018-08-26 00:38:38 Stocks went up on the news of your little Pecker problem.  They're betting on your impeachment.
2899 2018-08-26 00:36:45 Dont tell me that its your accomplishment if the stocks are great right now and its not on you if the stocks are down

2901 2018-08-26 00:36:22 Congrats to the wealthy who can afford to buy stocks!
2902 2018-08-26 00:35:41 He recently tweeted all time high stocks. 40min ago. SHAME  SHAME
2903 2018-08-26 00:34:51 Initially I thought we needed Hillary to continue floating in this deceptive bubble economy, but by forcing the dollar to be strong & supporting our lying, cheating, stealing, murderous, & abusive power hungry rich corporations with corrupt government, that too helps stocks rise.
2904 2018-08-26 00:34:45 Fake News Stocks are strong all my brokers say so ,Morgan Stanley is a Rhino who over priced itself
2905 2018-08-26 00:34:18 Congratulations to the wealthy Americans who are hiding part of there huge tax breaks in the stock market. Just remember that over priced stocks seem to always find a way to fall like a big bag to f heavy rocks
2906 2018-08-26 00:33:31 One public figure is only 10% of all Americans and it includes what is held related to their pension plans. Also individuals & pension plans from other nations hold U.S. stocks & take profits.
2907 2018-08-26 00:32:46 On a des stocks pour plusieurs années plus du MOx et d’où crois-tu que provient le charbon et le gaz? Et en quantités bien supérieures.
2908 2018-08-26 00:32:09 Sure, and that's still less than half. I said *directly* own stocks in my comment.
2909 2018-08-26 00:31:52 ethics reasons because its using tax payer provided offices/funds for housing without authorization. Most of the time its left alone though. So yes the salary of senators is extremely well paying and many make millions on the side (dont get me started on stocks) they also 3/4
2910 2018-08-26 00:30:47 I’m trynna buy some stocks n I want Tesla ones, but my dad thinks that’s too risky. What y’all think?
2911 2018-08-26 00:30:43 that is great.  happy donald your stocks might of all plumetwd you hold a blind account thanks to pence and America....gomk
2912 2018-08-26 00:30:12 Only 8% percent of stocks are owned by 80% of regular citizens. The top 20% of citizens own 92%. Whom are you congratulating?
2913 2018-08-26 00:29:50 Considering most Americans can't afford stocks....I don't think they care.
2914 2018-08-26 00:28:58 What other stocks you like?

2917 2018-08-26 00:26:37 Historically, I’ve always used a price to rent (which, is really cost basis/rent). Essentially a P/S for stocks. If we can be in a house for 66 months rent, I’m ecstatic. Though, there are potential drawbacks of that metric with a lot of the things we need to do now. Stay tuned.
2918 2018-08-26 00:26:12 Hey moron only people who invest in stocks are seeing anything but you are so dam ignorant and don't realize the middle income and the poor do not invest! Where is their share? Oh that's right its for the rich only!

2922 2018-08-26 00:24:46 Do you have ANY idea of how the stock market works and that most Americans don't even own any stocks?  WTH is wrong with you.
2923 2018-08-26 00:23:56 The majority of stocks are owned by 10% of the American population which includes pensions plus a % is owned by individuals, firms and pension plans of other nations many being NATO/Allies.

2934 2018-08-26 00:16:01 54% of US citizens are invested in stocks.This is not a win if you can't afford to invest or if your investments hover around the hundreds of dollars, but congratulations to those who have significant assets.
2935 2018-08-26 00:14:28 Thanks Donny. I’ve been overpaying for stocks for years to achieve this.
2936 2018-08-26 00:14:12 Time to swap some stocks!

2937 2018-08-26 00:14:08 I wonder how many middle class families have stocks to worry about.  Maybe he’s just sending the message to his rich friends

2940 2018-08-26 00:11:13 Hello, netflix is currently unavailable. Ubos na po stocks and mahirap talaga gumawa ng accs :( unahin po muna yung mga pending bago gumawa ng new accs 

For now, we only have 40 days Spotify premium, viu prem and fox+

2942 2018-08-26 00:10:29 Understandable.  “The Dow” is easier to say and more well-known, but is a meaningless index IMO.  The S&P 500 not only covers more stocks, but is market cap-weighted instead of price-weighted (arbitrary)
2943 2018-08-26 00:10:14 Stocks only effect 12% of America
2944 2018-08-26 00:09:02 The stock market isn't the economy, most can't afford to buy stocks because most are too busy deciding between food and electricity. Too many live paycheck to paycheck, those that do don't go buy things beyond necessities, which stalls economies. You don't economic very well.
2945 2018-08-26 00:04:42 Hey libs! Remember after @realDonaldTrump got elected and the stocks went through the roof? You guys insisted credit goes to BHO until the secon fiscal year, well I have but one question for all of you, how’s that crow taste? #MAGA
2946 2018-08-26 00:04:34 Value stocks, from Exxon (such irony) to Ford, are in a deep bear market. They are harmed by your negative nationalism and protectionism. You have zero clue. NOT ALL BENEFIT.

2948 2018-08-26 00:04:09 Ironically, stocks in Donald J Trump Faux Presidency LLC hit an all-time low. Just pennies on the dollar, I believe. Could the two facts be connected somehow?

2958 2018-08-26 00:00:25 Perhaps the stock market is high because the corporate tax breaks that you suggested were going to be put towards higher wages for employees actually went into buying back stocks in their companies. That would do it, wouldn't it, Donnie?

3017 2018-08-24 23:37:04 I stopped sharing charts anymore as I realized it still f*cks with my ego at this point in my development as a trader. I'm focusing on the very best leaders anyway and you can follow many professional traders that I follow as well to get the same stocks and charts from them.
3018 2018-08-24 23:36:54 Fucking bitter old man, it’s all about the money. So long as stocks are up, an money’s rolling in. None of them give a shit about the American people. I’ll keep my soul thank u, I don’t need ur money. Lock them all up, clean the swamp!!! Vote Blue

3025 2018-08-24 23:34:31 Ah ok I gotcha.  Didn’t know that had a name for that.  Yea the dividends go back into the account and I just use them to buy more of the same or other stocks.
3026 2018-08-24 23:34:07 You only get a point if you land a hit before I die. You didn’t. And how can you be +2 if I took 2 of your stocks while I had 2 stocks only?

3037 2018-08-24 23:26:43 Well, the official split in the spartan stocks, Nate Jenkins, and Troy Andrews both qualified for the A class tonight. This is the 4th time for both drivers, so both are now in the A class points.
3038 2018-08-24 23:25:23 @OpTic_BigTymeR i think it would be beneficial if you made a video talking and or showing how to get started such as what you use to monitor stocks, how much money you would recommend etc..
3039 2018-08-24 23:23:49 I still do not see any enthusiasm in this mkt. this mkt is headed higher. They will make all the vacationing money managers who come back to find out they hold defensive stocks that are going down while the mkt is headed higher. FOMO will set in.

3042 2018-08-24 23:19:35 In 20 yrs will you care if stocks dropped 5% tomorrow? I wouldn't either. Don't try to time the market. Just start investing regularly.
3043 2018-08-24 23:19:31 Cause there is money to be made. Anyone who bought oil company stocks when oil fell to $30/barrel in Jan of 2016 is making a killing.
3044 2018-08-24 23:19:02 What a incredible day for the market. Rotation back into tech and growth stocks (risk-on). I’m seeing alot of b/o’s in those stocks. What I expect forward is some continuation early next week followed by a retest of said b/o’s (market put in a higher low).

3049 2018-08-24 23:16:19 A simple trick for $AMZN traders: Statistically speaking; when you multiply Amazon's daily opening price with 1.0022 and buy long to that target, you can end up winning at least 75% of your trades every single day! BONUS: 1.003 for 70%  This is not a financial advice! #stocks
3050 2018-08-24 23:15:37 Other countries have fixed spending limits for elections, with campaign budgets coming from taxes and fixed allowances of private donations.

Full auto is tightly regulated because government doesn’t want civilians to have them.

Yes, I should be able to own full auto after a complete background check, no bullshit fees and no special license.

The only way to win is to employ the “opener” strategy and have our bench players pinch hit in the pitchers spot each time thru the order.
3056 2018-08-24 23:12:04 The Dow index has only 30 stocks so it often diverges from broader indexes. But this year is particularly bad for the Dow, +4.3% YTD vs +7.5% for S&P 500, +12.4% for Russell 2000 small-stock index, +15.1% for Nasdaq.
Weak links in the Dow: $MMM -12.8% YTD, $CAT -12.3%, $PG -9.3%.
3057 2018-08-24 23:09:59 One thing Powell did confirm today, on top of what the FOMC minutes said: when the next crisis hits, the #Fed will ride to the rescue once again.

3059 2018-08-24 23:09:09 The conclusion is that if an investor was somehow able to avoid the 25% most profitable stocks and instead invested in the other 75% his/her total gain from 1983 to 2007 would be 0%. In other words, a minority of stocks are responsible for the majority of the market’s gains.
3060 2018-08-24 23:06:52 @POTUS @ABC @NBCNews @FoxNews Trump claims the stock market will crash if he is impeached. When the value of stocks decreases, the rich are the ones who suffer. Wait until their new tax rates are revoked ! VOTE DEMOCRATIC !
3061 2018-08-24 23:06:30 investment in stocks & watch it grow
3062 2018-08-24 23:06:09 We understand how you are feeling, Sumit. However, we have no specific time frame to provide. You may select "Notify Me" on the order page to receive an email once stocks are back. Your patience is appreciated.
3063 2018-08-24 23:05:57 Oh you're going to take Bernie Sanders' word for it? Whether wealth is kept in cash or real estate or stocks, in the U.S. or Cayman Islands or on the moon, WEALTH IS NOT TAXED BY THE UNITED STATES. Only income is taxed.
3064 2018-08-24 23:05:18 You needed to play $BABA when they reported.. Good money. #Stocks
3065 2018-08-24 23:04:19 All of this noise about Mueller and Manafort and Cohen, etc, is burying the real story here, and that's the Trump economy, which is absolutely booming. Stocks near record highs, consumer optimism at record highs, more available jobs than workers, wages up, labor participation up
3066 2018-08-24 23:02:40 Isn’t it ironic , someone trying to “teach” us how to make money on stocks telling us not to take advice from teachers. Maybe if they could make money from it they wouldnt be trying to teach us in the first place 
3067 2018-08-24 23:02:37 Parianas @_machiparu_ Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
3068 2018-08-24 23:02:00 The argument about bonus, stocks is all an eyewash to hide the abuse. Compare their salary with their American peers and market wage. The abuse is clear. #NoHR392
3069 2018-08-24 23:01:49 I’ve been long $CRON from 4.65 and did you notice Aphria gained 23% today? Pot stocks getting high again
3070 2018-08-24 23:01:12 Exactly! My main money goes into stocks and savings. My fun money goes into #cryptos and travel.

3072 2018-08-24 23:00:05 I've traded a few of the crypto proxy stocks. They're volatile but there's plenty of movement in the market if you know where to look, especially if you're using options
3073 2018-08-24 22:59:33 CNBC has had guest after guest on since the start of the year that say buy value stocks instead of growth stocks. In the meantime, Growth continues to outperform. Perhaps they should get a technician on.
3074 2018-08-24 22:59:32 Tesla is the mafia of stocks. No matter how hard you try to exit the debate a Musk desciple sucks you back in. I need to grow up!
3075 2018-08-24 22:57:52 160,000 LMT (Lockheed Martin) stocks & stock options given to Comey in 2009 that would have been worth $30 million. By 2009 Comey had over 160k shares of Lockheed Martin.  This came from a new book, “COMPRIMISED”!!!!
3076 2018-08-24 22:57:37 I have worked hard to overcome my prejudices on certain stocks, too.  And now it's pot and booze.  Oh well--as long as it makes money
  Thanks for all you do!
3077 2018-08-24 22:56:33 @BretBaier sorry once @HarfMaria start talking I can’t stomach the lies. State department mouth piece spewing propaganda lowers your shows credibility
3078 2018-08-24 22:56:18 #ico #sunxcoin #sunxcointoken Financial investment is the allocation of money in expectation of some financial gains. These gains in financial market perspective are called returns and can either be capital gain or investment income, for example, the purchase of bonds and stocks.
3079 2018-08-24 22:54:09 Agreed. You don't need wealth to own stocks or "good luck" to ascend ranks (unless you work for a Japanese company), etc.

If we invent time machine one day, it should be compulsory to spend a few days in pre-capitalism and in 5 randomly chosen socialist/communist states.
3080 2018-08-24 22:52:15 ninry is soooo full of shttttttttt i took 4 stocks from them two from him and two from ghost
3081 2018-08-24 22:51:48 true for all biotech stocks
3082 2018-08-24 22:51:16 look at the way both incidents were and are being handled.  law enforcement neglect. fbi handling of the cases. I believe both shooters were coaxed into it. end result bump stocks banned. A push to start confiscating guns. NRA catching flack for something they had no part of
3083 2018-08-24 22:50:38 Whenever it is, it'll be a great time to load up on tPA and hospice stocks!
3084 2018-08-24 22:50:23 This stock has more short-sellers compared to any stock on the market - there’s nothing strange about me watching & Tweeting about this. LOL
3085 2018-08-24 22:50:19 Screamed for people to buy $AMD couple of years ago when the stock traded below $3. Today this stock is over $20 per share! You liked Intel, I liked AMD. #Stocks
3086 2018-08-24 22:50:06 I don't think he's going to fire coach stocks. I do believe he's going to use next season to evaluate her. because he expected to make the playoffs this year and they didn't. now he's looking to vie for the championship next year.

3088 2018-08-24 22:49:32 @kylemacd Re hate signaling. Spoke to a, retired in NZ, US psychiatrist last night. Came from small town with 2 of them. The other gathered up all his stocks and bonds certificates & burned them, put $1 on the table for every year with his wife & shot himself. "Very angry man".
3089 2018-08-24 22:48:19 Mastering timing (peaks and troughs), sector selection (rotation), and individual stock selection (shortlist) are trade/investing skills (combined) vastly misunderstood! #Stocks #Investing
3090 2018-08-24 22:45:22 2 technology stocks jumped strong  on Friday:
$SPLK 14.8%, $VEEV 12.4%
3091 2018-08-24 22:43:21 Shut the fuck up. No one buys the trickle down bullshit anymore. Supply side economics barely work in pristine theoretical models and NEVER in the real world. Want to create jobs and grow the economy, give money to poor people, they spend it on goods and services, not stocks
3092 2018-08-24 22:42:12 Given that stocks were at record highs after THIS WEEK, im not too worried
3093 2018-08-24 22:41:29 Chez moi il y a des stocks d'ice tea, de fanta, de coca, jus d'orange, bières ect mais même plus d'eau...
3094 2018-08-24 22:40:28 read some article early on that stated he would have been more wealthy if he'd simply invested his inheritance in stocks & mutual funds- instead of all his failing business enterprises.
3095 2018-08-24 22:40:23 20 #stocks made all-time highs in technology sector, check these:
$CRM, $SPLK, $FTNT, $PANW, $SNPS, $TTWO, $SQ, $VRSK, $FISV, $NVDA, $ADP, $VEEV, $ANET
3096 2018-08-24 22:40:08 I’m in! I think putting idiot criminals like Hunter In stocks like in the olden  days  in the town center.
3097 2018-08-24 22:39:43 LDS corp owns $1b in pharma stocks. :/
3098 2018-08-24 22:38:19 #StocksToBuyIfTrumpIsImpeached My email tells me this topic is trending. They talk about Harley Davidson and some of the auto stocks plus getting rid of this nonsensical, non-coordinated trade war with the world.
3099 2018-08-24 22:37:54 I have no idea why anyone would ever invest in individual energy stocks, or even the sector in the long term.

Commodities, OTOH, are gold (in one case, literally)
3100 2018-08-24 22:37:23 The people who complain about Lucas getting so much damage or getting stocks off of a grab are probably the same people who have never played a non SF fighting game.

I'll glady take 60% or more damage compared to losing a stock after getting touched once by someone with meter
3101 2018-08-24 22:35:40 $TROV 0.86 was high today; it is trying to come off the consolidation channel around 0.8s ....I am watching it ....
3102 2018-08-24 22:35:25 Una de las que tengo en seguimiento y tuve en su momento . Ha roto maximos y buena pinta . A ver si le puedo meter pronto que la liquidez que saqué ayer y hoy la he ido metiendo en $ZUO .
3103 2018-08-24 22:34:28 Maybe buy some stocks to share in the wealth and have an equity stake?
3104 2018-08-24 22:32:19 Because parabolic advances are fast but decline and consolidation are slow. We see it now. It takes Bitcoin forever to reach the bottom - its been 8 months and its not there yet. But still crypto cycles are faster than traditional stocks'.
3105 2018-08-24 22:31:30 Una norma, lo primero que entra es lo primero que sale asi se manejan los stocks, segun su precio de adquisicion mas su margen de beneficio, cuando quedan pocas unidades liquidan todo ,para comprar asi sea la misma mercancia mas cara deben salir de la anterior
3106 2018-08-24 22:31:17 Stocks poised to edge higher as investors await Powell’s Jackson Hole speech: NOBODY GIVES A PHUK EXCEPT THE REPUBLICUNT CORP "KOCH'-SUKKAS ONE-PERCENTER PHUK'N HOODS !!!
3107 2018-08-24 22:30:25 These are the 2 stocks in energy sector that yesterday made all-time highs:
$MPC, $ANDV
3108 2018-08-24 22:28:29 McDonald stocks are up too.
3109 2018-08-24 22:28:12 As the "trouble" gets deeper, stocks keep climbing...strange.  @roughtradeX @realAliTweets @Linda3717 @wonderfullone @RubeBait @cowgirlup1a
3110 2018-08-24 22:27:43 Don’t confuse the economy for the market. Obama’s fiscal stimulus and bailouts saved the economy and put it back in the track towards growth. Trump’s tax cuts allowed corporations to buy back stocks & improve their bottom line, making equities more attractive to buyers.
3111 2018-08-24 22:26:10 It's CHAMPIONSHIP night here at @amspeedway!!! 

Out of our 7 local divisions, 5 have  implications in their races tonight! 

- Battles include a 4-driver battle in Limiteds.

- 2 point (1 spot) lead in Mini-Stocks

- TIE in Late Model Stocks before tonight's Twin-40's.


3112 2018-08-24 22:25:01 Thanks Corinna, I have rescheduled for November... it’s just a real shame when stocks are low, so you try to help, but actually you can’t... so then to see all the marketing around it when you can’t actually get an appointment is a bit frustrating...
3113 2018-08-24 22:24:49 3rd Dave Ramsey believes stocks will never go down.  He believes in investing in mutual funds which is tied in with the stock market. Im not against in investing in stocks but to say the Amercian economy can never crash is arrogant.
3114 2018-08-24 22:23:35 Explains why sex toy stocks were higher today! 
3115 2018-08-24 22:23:18 Not sure what YOU'RE asking.  Of course shorts talk down the stocks they have a position in.  Or they may well be convinced it's going down anyway. But I don't see an efficient way for poorly performing ( in actual business of profits ) company's to go down in value otherwise
3116 2018-08-24 22:23:09 Great article. We that have been in crypto game for a few years know these lessons all too well, but many still fall victim to the "fundamentals" fomo trap. 

Will be buying your penny stocks book to check out. Interested in learning how I can short these on the way down.
3117 2018-08-24 22:22:50 US eqty: Stocks rose to record, while USD deepened losses after Fed Powell at Jackson Hole signaled CB has no intention of accelerating pace of rate hikes. Said gradual rate hikes are prob appropriate if growth stays strong
SPX NDX DJIA UST (+), USD DXY (-/=)
3118 2018-08-24 22:22:44 @CNBC I go to Fast Money - CNBC for stock and market information. Dan Nathan become a political commentator. There's almost infinite amount of sources for that type information I can go to. When he talks about stocks and markets he's good. Unfortunately it's not often.
3119 2018-08-24 22:21:18 He has a good point. The Dems have said that want to Nationalize Corporations so that would scare share holders into buying American companies. Stocks would go down since the market is mostly speculation.
3120 2018-08-24 22:20:35 Again, We Are the Laughing Stocks of the World. Let's NOT Forget 9/11 Happened Courtesy of Bill Clinton & Monica Lewinski Investigation!
3121 2018-08-24 22:20:26 These are the 3 stocks in finance sector that yesterday set all-time highs:
$BRO, $ORI, $ROL
3122 2018-08-24 22:20:18 $CRON marijuana stocks is the new hype after crypto, ya I said it
3123 2018-08-24 22:20:09 It's safe to say that @MoviePass doesn't care. Their incompetent business plan has failed, they have investors filing lawsuits, customers ready to sue, they break contracts on annual subscribers and peddling worthless stocks to gullible investors to fund their golden parachutes.
3124 2018-08-24 22:19:33 only in bitcoin! supposedly in stocks but that is a thing of trading books from the 70's
not in stock futures, just on the down days and the days after when the bagman shorts "cover"
3125 2018-08-24 22:19:09 U.S. stocks close  higher with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closing at records, after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell affirmed the central bank’s strategy of gradually normalizing monetary policy.
3126 2018-08-24 22:18:35 Ron Heeney is now quick time in the street stocks.
3127 2018-08-24 22:16:19 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your depression
3128 2018-08-24 22:15:45 John Kennedy is quick so far 14.511 in the street stocks.
3129 2018-08-24 22:15:28 Don't begrudge you for taking profits, but I don't think Trump is the enemy. If there's a trade deal, stocks will go up. He also appointed Hester Pierce to SEC and other Bitcoiners.
3130 2018-08-24 22:14:51 Oh yeah man. All the early film stuff (stocks, grey cards, etc.) was made explicitly to exclude black people.
3131 2018-08-24 22:14:09 predicting $SPY falls 3% to 279 next week, end of August - 

1) $30 B in end of month QT
2) very poor seasonality
3) day 13 Demark exhaustion
4) negative RSI divergences
5) stocks following copper prices / EM / treasury yields / yuan lower after recently diverging
3132 2018-08-24 22:13:34 how would they do that in non order book stocks?
3133 2018-08-24 22:13:30 via GerberKawasaki: What a great week for markets and stocks. Much better than last friday. Almost all stocks moving higher. Tesla up a lot from last week and Nvidia as well. $TSLA $NVDA $tsla
3134 2018-08-24 22:13:25 How to save money buy good growth stocks and never sell them.

3136 2018-08-24 22:12:59 Mnuchin: what would be your philosophy as Fed chairman?

Powell: well, in the past the Fed sometimes tightened too slowly and sometimes too quickly. Therefore I’ll tighten once a quarter and wait for stocks to respond

Mnuchin: you’re hired
3137 2018-08-24 22:12:35 Hey  @jimcramer  GoDaddy, what do you think? sell or retain stocks hoping for exponential growth later on the years?!
3138 2018-08-24 22:12:21 Any of the FANG stocks
3139 2018-08-24 22:11:34 You really are ignorant. #StockMarket My 401k & stocks have been very happy. He's done more in a cpl years than the last #POTUS. Ppl need to show respect. It's getting out of control & disgusting. #Freedom

3141 2018-08-24 22:09:53 They have $32 bil in stocks in general not just big pharm. They are for medical marijuana with regulations. The separation of church and state is not for the church, it’s for the state. The government can’t make a law for or against a certain religion.
3142 2018-08-24 22:09:26 Enfin je ne confirme pas, mais c’est qu’il n’y a pas d’autre explication possible. @adidasFR est lamentable avec des ruptures de stocks mais quand même 
3143 2018-08-24 22:09:03 Oh my! My new cannabis/marijuana watch list is on fire. The better stocks are up over 9%. $CRON us up over 22%, a buck-50 at the close and another 50 in after hours.

3147 2018-08-24 22:05:35 First group of spartan stocks is on the track. We will have to wait to figure out points after qualifications. Some of these cars may qualify for the A class, and if they do, they are an A class points car. Nate Jenkins @JPM_42_ is one of those cars.
3148 2018-08-24 22:05:15 Traded from my phone throughout most the morning sporadically and got my ass kicked. Stepped back and relaxed. Made back all my losses and gained 1% on the account over the last hour of the day. Conviction and waiting for a play to setup is what you need in the game of stocks.

3155 2018-08-24 21:58:55 they have stocks again :))
3156 2018-08-24 21:58:47 The only collapse I’d be worried about are FANG stocks. 
3157 2018-08-24 21:58:12 People who buy valuation wind up with $GE and other stocks where money goes to die. Money always piles in for future growth, this is why guidance > earnings.
3158 2018-08-24 21:56:44 So if this case does not get dismissed and gains traction, what does that mean for the federal government. So far, there are many chiefs vying for ownership stocks in the pipeline, but also many lands obviously challenging the approval without their consent.
3159 2018-08-24 21:56:07 One last thing. Donald said he sold all of his stocks around May of 2016. So was at 1650 now at 2870. He said stock market was a huuuuuuge bubble. That is unless you think he didn’t tell the truth about selling back then. Brilliant
3160 2018-08-24 21:55:24 Lord haw haw should be in stocks
3161 2018-08-24 21:55:15 @traderstewie I’m no fancy options trader, and this is an easy market to be long, but Stewie helped me learn charts the right way, find the right entry points, and make sells on stocks if held forever. Always a great follow, and has earned me $$. And a decent chef!
3162 2018-08-24 21:53:40 Stock buybacks are good for everyone with a 401k . When a company buys back stocks the price increases making your 401k rise in value , I don’t think you knew that, did you?
3163 2018-08-24 21:53:17 Wow what a week for Fiber Optics stocks...  ;))  Yet still very early in the move.  $MTSI just one of many lovlies...
3164 2018-08-24 21:52:48 I've been thinking the same thing lately. These penny stocks are tricky
3165 2018-08-24 21:52:36 Begnning of the year,US stocks swooned with biggest daily loss but before VIX quotient was ringing.
3166 2018-08-24 21:51:35 Yeah businesses are buying back their own stocks.
3167 2018-08-24 21:50:54 $AMMA called this penny romp action early at $0.20 for a run to $0.61— 195% run. Calling $YUMA and $APRI early as the next candidates. Alerted APRI today

3176 2018-08-24 21:43:30 Dear god he only had 91 million in his stock holdings.  So those stocks would be less than 1 pct of his claimed net worth.

3188 2018-08-24 21:36:34 Hugh can bugger off back to his River Cottage and encourage more people to take fresh water fish out to eat and decimate stocks further. First class idiot.
3189 2018-08-24 21:36:14 People do more due diligence on which bank is paying the highest money market rates than deciding on which stocks to buy.

3191 2018-08-24 21:34:47 Investing in stocks only lasts as long as their value is high.

3193 2018-08-24 21:34:41 > Without quotas then fish stocks would be fished out.

That's the official line. I beg 2 differ. Quotes (on dead fish) are not enforceable. All they can do is enforce how much is *reported*.

Makes it really easy to invest, and getting to try investing strategies that I can’t to do with my other stocks account. Already seeing gains too. Will definitely invest more next pay day

3204 2018-08-24 21:31:08 The most powerful rallies occur in stocks with high short interest. When short sellers have the thesis wrong, they become forced buyers.

3208 2018-08-24 21:29:50 It’s not worth the bother to do anything with bump stocks. The whole point of banning things is to protect society. There is no special danger from bump stocks. Vegas shooter could have killed just as many with a semi-auto RIFLE. Over the years, relatively small number...
3209 2018-08-24 21:28:38 Hell yes. If I had stocks now I’d start sliding into cash. I did that when Bush got elected 2nd time & didn’t lose a cent in the crash. Remember: investment is a risk. Anything but principal is extra. Move what you can & protect it before it’s too late or greed will destroy you.

3230 2018-08-24 21:17:13 Most people today have no idea how hard it is to invest successfully. Many have made a lot of money past several years chasing overvalued big tech stocks that seem to never go down. Even the professionals have become lazy and complacent.
3231 2018-08-24 21:16:50 Its Friday. My bank account good. Stocks doing well. I have health insurance. House is clean. Foriegn whip out front. Tank on full.

3232 2018-08-24 21:16:29 I couldn't agree more with your analysis. There is one thing I would add though. Instead of obsessing about short sellers, I'd simply execute the vision and prove them wrong over time. High short interest stocks tend to outperform "un-hated" stocks when the company delivers.

3292 2018-08-24 20:49:30 If it wasn't for shorts you'd be drowning in overvalued stocks as the best hype would propel them to ridiculous heights. There aren't enough prudent investors to simply 'Not buy them' for those listing to be properly valued

3303 2018-08-24 20:42:45 Hey @TheLoneLocus it will be running until 6th September or until stocks last in store  it is certainly an amazing deal 
3304 2018-08-24 20:42:29 The top five most active stocks today were $AMD, $GGP, $BAC, $GE. and $MU.
3305 2018-08-24 20:42:06 I’m assuming you mean $NVDA  and the pot stocks are soaring fast however there’s plenty of belief in these companies. It’s a real industry. It’s not close to any bubble yet, it’s just getting started. It’s ok to take a little risk every now and then. $CGC $TLRY $CRON $KSHB
3306 2018-08-24 20:42:02 All my mentor is having me focus on are stocks ...
3307 2018-08-24 20:41:54 Since Weed Is Not Legal In South Carolina Yet. I Can’t Wait To Invest In A Dispensary, But in the Meantime These Weed Stocks I’ve Been Investing In This Year So Far Is Looking Lovely... #CannabisStocks 
3308 2018-08-24 20:41:53 WAIT WHAT TARGET STOCKS BTS?!
3309 2018-08-24 20:41:47 Three pot stocks are now more or less permanently on screen these days: $CGC, $CRON, and $TLRY ... super liquid and clean.
3310 2018-08-24 20:41:29 All those guys were Rivals 60-100ish and their stocks never seemed to rise post commitment, for whatever reason. Maybe they were tacitly "punished" for committing way early. Maybe they stopped pushing themselves because they were "off the market". Peters had concussion issues.
3311 2018-08-24 20:41:12 Well I’ll certainly defer to your expertise on this, but I have to say late 2011 was an excellent time to buy most stocks.
3312 2018-08-24 20:40:05 Stocks Close Mostly Higher Following Powell Comments - U.S. Commentary ...
3313 2018-08-24 20:40:02 wishing realprophet well, he was hot on pot stocks and then he went on about how over valued housing in Canada was. and I think judging by others' tweets, he might of been short pot stocks recently or missed their recent rise. oh well. made out well also could be losing big. miss
3314 2018-08-24 20:39:23 Besides the importance how to find the strongest stocks in terms of performance, it is also very important to have a clear strategy to avoid all the noise (the recommendations …) and “just” do the job that ensure I have full responsibility of my trades.
3315 2018-08-24 20:39:03 Lots of crazy in Trump's F&F interview. He said lots of people would be poor if he was impeached. Does he think the stock market would plunge? Does he know what % of Americans own stocks? #StupidOrLying #Corrupt #TrumpRussia
3316 2018-08-24 20:38:07 Stocks were good to me this week 
3317 2018-08-24 20:37:31 Let me guess, she owns stocks in the guns she wants to buy
3318 2018-08-24 20:36:28 too late. just emptied my IRA to buy individual stocks. Penalties can't slow me down
3319 2018-08-24 20:36:20 (Certainly the way to mine) - but true, regular food so he stocks up for winter. Just a question as to where he lives. Could be in the garden. Could be half a mile away...
3320 2018-08-24 20:36:11 i am surprised their ratings are not at zero yet = what a fkin waste of time - when they do not cheerlead for stocks it is for BTC .....
3321 2018-08-24 20:36:04 Or things such as a thinner wallet because my big pharma stocks went down in value.
3322 2018-08-24 20:35:44 FT City 4 vs Magdala 2. Not sure how to sum that up! Visitors score 2 of their 3 pens, none of which were fouls. 3 of City’s goals come from 16-year olds Caudwell (2) & Hill. Stocks scores free kick. Gleeson misses a pen. Haggis sin-binned. Think that’s it! 3 from 3 
3323 2018-08-24 20:35:26 tell buddy ass to call me i can boost his stocks 300%
3324 2018-08-24 20:35:20 if you ever want to know how bad my luck is, the state of VA owed me and my brothers money since they never forwarded mail containing some stocks in our names. my brothers all got their stuff within a month of the claim being sent in. the state forgot mine was in the system
3325 2018-08-24 20:34:58 Thanks Obama!

But now that corporations and institutions have used their tax cuts to buy back their stocks, get ready for the drop!
3326 2018-08-24 20:34:37 Appropriate theme song for all these screaming Pot stocks.
3327 2018-08-24 20:34:29 Really unlikely, was mostly a comment on CNBC's habit of pumping doomed stocks
3328 2018-08-24 20:34:15 Nice week for momentum stocks. Now to get busy trailing stops to reduce open risk... 
3329 2018-08-24 20:34:10 My top 6 calls this week were:
$AMMA +210%
$SSC +165% (+186% if you held)
$IGC +22% (+62% if you held)
$CVM +23% (+56% from swing idea)
$KOSS +33%

3343 2018-08-24 20:24:57 you know I'm a big fan of stocks that make the biggest %/range move against the prior trend as an indication of trend change - direction unimportant - I'll admit it can be tough to take action on big % days but a process is a process
3344 2018-08-24 20:24:10 just reminding you that stocks that trade for hundreds of $$$ per share are usually strong stocks that have been market leaders...
3345 2018-08-24 20:24:03 Speaking for the straight white dudes, let me set the record straight (haha): We do talk politics. At the country club. It does affect the rate of marginal return on our stocks and mutual funds.
3346 2018-08-24 20:23:57 They even admit that they will overlook cheetoincharge paying off a porn star as long as their stocks stay up. what will it take for them to realize he is a complete idiot and is doing nothing great for our country? 
3347 2018-08-24 20:23:29 This is one of the reasons why I always try to at least play a Bo3 set on FG.  Because I know most people want the run back if they lose.

And it's not like they don't improve.  I've had several instances where I two stock my opponent, then he two stocks me in the next match.
3348 2018-08-24 20:23:14 Trump said he was getting rid of bump stocks - another lie
3349 2018-08-24 20:22:59 i like your perspective - top sectors and then top stocks within the sectors - think big!

3351 2018-08-24 20:22:14 Absolutely everything but the US dollar and volatility went up today. Even crypto! Mammoth gains among Tech stocks, Cannabis stocks and EM.
3352 2018-08-24 20:21:39 You’re ‘ve injected the economy with one time bonuses to the ultra rich which was usd to buy back stocks and in the process you have blown the budget... in short time the next crash will be here just like when republicans crashed the economy in 1929 and 2008.
3353 2018-08-24 20:21:37 A@the tax cuts haven’t raised wages,

C@the tax cuts may actually reduce wages according Paul K. #TaxScam
3354 2018-08-24 20:19:51 @Chelsea_Fagan Hi there.  How can I learn more about stocks? Is there a website that you're familiar with?
3355 2018-08-24 20:19:31 Who is paying for all this? I can guarantee that it will end up as increased cost to the NHS. Medical companies run lean and with minimal stocks nowadays. Just think this is bizarre. Cost to companies, possible loss of jobs. Why can brexiteer’s not see the truth?
3356 2018-08-24 20:19:15 Personally think It’s now all about us stocks : trump can’t afford to see stocks down for re election; and China wants to see us stock crash so trump is weaker and make trade war easier

3361 2018-08-24 20:16:54 $IBB $XBI risks with individual stocks, biotech in particular, are growing. Too many fake news (including M&A), hacking, pumping, dumping, insider trading, and all other manipulations. Individual investors are their prey.
3362 2018-08-24 20:16:20 Sobre todo en los market leaders
3363 2018-08-24 20:16:17 Sunday night should be interesting as Asian markets see new highs in U.S. stocks and likely follow through.  Tough to see any resistance at all next week going into Labor day.  Was bad timing for me to initiate a short.
3364 2018-08-24 20:16:07 The S&P 500 just notched its first closing high since late January. The Dow isn't far behind. #stocks
3365 2018-08-24 20:15:33 The S&P 500 index is closing at a record high, just two days after the current bull market in stocks became the longest in history.
The Nasdaq composite and the Russell 2000 indexes also closed at all-time highs Friday.
3366 2018-08-24 20:15:06 World stocks generally edge higher: US +.6%; Europe +.1%. Even mildly disappointing news on China & Mexico trade issue couldn't derail the US market. Investors focused too much on economy & profits hoping trade issues will be resolved. Problem: If not, a major volatility spike

3370 2018-08-24 20:13:49 Of course, I live in Canada, only thing people talk about are weed stocks. There will be winners but it’s a bubble industry right now. There will be a day of reckoning followed by years of consolidation.
3371 2018-08-24 20:13:45 Yes. Wait for the trigger and then act! No forecasting. Let the stocks "talk."
3372 2018-08-24 20:13:41 BREAKING: Nasdaq, S&P 500 both close at record highs. - @wcbs880 #money #biz #stocks
3373 2018-08-24 20:13:38 Diversification I do not regard to be an edge (actually the contrary). For me it is important to find the strongest sectors and then scan for the strongest stocks within the sector.  No prediction, but $MEOH looks as it is about to breach the base.
3374 2018-08-24 20:11:50 That's right, I forgot sbout Q referencing a financial loss for FB before their stocks took a dive.
3375 2018-08-24 20:09:46 Banner day for #Stocks #SP500 up 18 to 2875 #NASDAQ up 68 to 7946, both end the week at RECORD HIGHS #Dow up 133 #Fed #FriYAY @KNX1070 @MottekOnMoney
3376 2018-08-24 20:09:46 Invest in weed and ACB if you want to be in the green Tim, the volatility is constant.   Cron has good dips though to catch.  Must be a goldmine trading as a us citizen into Canadian stocks. Will you ever be in Canada to talk ?
3377 2018-08-24 20:09:12 Not only have they invested money, they have $1.3 billion worth of stocks in 7 different pharmaceutical companies  (thank you for all of this I appreciate you)
3378 2018-08-24 20:08:39 Good call.. I too was thinking $60 by end of day.... Hopefully next week.
3379 2018-08-24 20:08:35 Our @Cath_Kidston store now stocks the Alice in Wonderland collection!
3380 2018-08-24 20:06:15 Also, if a pub stocks local craft because they’re able to make more margin, so be it. As long as they have local craft, I’m happy. If publican needs craft to be profitable to counterbalance not taking bribes from the big guys, that’s fine with me.
3381 2018-08-24 20:06:14 On the contrary. People would be celebrating. Trade war gone, families reunited, other countries would respect us. Stocks would go up.
3382 2018-08-24 20:06:11 3 weeks of trading stocks and the first one green.
And only because i let my profits go high and add only to winning positions.
Also found that my swing trade strategy works only  for mid cap stocks.
3383 2018-08-24 20:05:59 Thats a good long term hold but those gains i posted were on stock options not actual stocks
3384 2018-08-24 20:05:57 8 million ,4 mill to use in life the other 4 invested in stocks.keeping an eye on the market as it fluctuates, and sell big.
3385 2018-08-24 20:05:42 I own plenty of stocks! Count me in, I’d love to test that theory! trump needs to walk the walk, or sit the F*ck down and shut the hell up!
3386 2018-08-24 20:05:33 I’m not good at analysis when it comes to ending stocks, etc. and interpreting what that could mean for the future.
3387 2018-08-24 20:04:39 And only his cult take that crap seriously. If anything stocks will rise, considering how many businesses don't seem to trust him much now.
3388 2018-08-24 20:03:28 The internals on the other hand are not so good. According to @CNBC just now, 20% of the component stocks of the S&P are in bear market territory.
3389 2018-08-24 20:03:25 US stocks closed higher on the day, with the S&P 500 closing a fresh record high: $DJIA +133, $SPX +18

3392 2018-08-24 20:03:19 #US stocks rose, sending the S&P 500 Index past its January record, as an expanding economy and surging earnings erased a six-month drought in which equities tumbled into a correction. The $USD dropped!
3393 2018-08-24 20:02:16 YUP  bc the opioids  just help get the church more money bc they have like $1.8 BILLION in pharm stocks. Lmao so of course they don’t want it legalized.

3398 2018-08-24 20:00:40 How has he ruinin our country.  He has done more that he promised he would do in the shortest amount of time then any president.  Did you have a problem with the corruption that went on under the Obama administration?  
Our taxes are lower, stocks higher, unemployment lower
3399 2018-08-24 20:00:23 A simple trick for $AMZN traders: Statistically speaking; when you multiply Amazon's daily opening price with 1.0022 and buy long to that target, you can end up winning at least 75% of your trades every single day! BONUS: 1.003 for 70%  This is not a financial advice! #stocks

3402 2018-08-24 19:59:53 You need to regulate medical charges. Getting taxpayers to pay for ludicrous medical bills is not the answer it feeds the problem. Insurance company stocks took off where Obamacare was launch. Look it up. The law said you had to buy their services. Duh.
3403 2018-08-24 19:59:17 Stocks went up all week!! #CloseStrong
3404 2018-08-24 19:59:13 Oh, sorry I didn’t know that. I have all the major cannabis stocks in my portfolio anyway.
3405 2018-08-24 19:57:38 Stocks are up over 8000 more since his election.Took Obama 8 years to get that.If he didn’t put so many regulations it would have been double that.Also don’t forget the $9T debt he added. You liberals blamed Bush for 8 years,now you want to take credit for POTUS’s successes.
3406 2018-08-24 19:57:34 Too bad Bloomberg isn't a public company.  Just think of all the money that could be saved by laying off some of the 19,000 people working there.  That money could then be used to buy back some of the stocks.  
How much is your salary?
3407 2018-08-24 19:55:18 I'm short $TSLA Aug 31st $320 Puts but that lunatic on CNBC that pitches twice a week $TSLA to $4,000 is absolutely irresponsible pumper! It's early 2,000 all over again, where many stocks ended at ZERO !
3408 2018-08-24 19:55:17 I absolutely loved watching @OpTic_BigTymeR trade stocks, i have no idea what he said half the time but i loved watching and somewhat learning

3414 2018-08-24 19:53:25 @jimcramer Jim, how about those gamer stocks today 
3415 2018-08-24 19:53:23 Perhaps all stock markets around the world drop in that time frame? Smart money should already be flowing into some asset class other than stocks...
3416 2018-08-24 19:53:14 And you left out working hard to earn money for a 401 and stocks maybe even a small savings account. Get a job and join in.
3417 2018-08-24 19:52:42 what millions are you referring to. Obama did not have any money. he had a networth of 1.3 million. thats not liquid. thats homes, stocks ect. y do you think he came out and admitted to doing drugs. lol. no money to hide it. lol
3418 2018-08-24 19:52:23 Here’s a video of bill Clinton with a cigar
3419 2018-08-24 19:52:04 Stocks picking back up
3420 2018-08-24 19:51:52 I think all traders know the dilemma. I always aim to prioritize my winning positions in terms scaling in instead of chasing new stocks, but it's not easy.

$MEOH another candidate 
3421 2018-08-24 19:51:47 Obstructing
3422 2018-08-24 19:50:57 We have to stop with the whole mythical market maker thing.  You market order and some GUY is watching for my order and then increasing my buy point? Really...  in a fraction of a second while watching the other 1800 penny stocks in play and with a 1000 orders per minute...
3423 2018-08-24 19:50:37 Speaking of FOMO! Moving brokers in an active market has been tough! I staggered the moves, moving cash first, then remaining stocks & leaving cash, so I can buy dips, but not sell stocks during transfers.

Strategy: "while the cat's away, the mice will play" til Labor Day.

3424 2018-08-24 19:50:17 you're a unicorn as far as I'm concerned! I want to be in on an all-girl cabal discussing stocks
3425 2018-08-24 19:49:36 What stocks? 
3426 2018-08-24 19:49:06 No daily trade for options 
Yes daily trade for stocks only
3427 2018-08-24 19:49:02 TBH I think marketing wise it's all good. Their model is to save on analysts and spend more time on promotion. With growth stocks, if you can hoard assets for a time this way.
I don't think they srsly believe that this is any kind of real research
3428 2018-08-24 19:48:38 Always see the "DeMark Exhaustion" notes on Indices and Indiv. stocks from the usual doom & gloom crowd, never actually seen one work...and then they'll just change the time-frame...
3429 2018-08-24 19:47:16 Should be locked in the stocks in the town centre 
3430 2018-08-24 19:47:08 Stocks are just drifting- and it happens to be to the upside- because of Extremely Low volume.
3431 2018-08-24 19:46:56 Good to know valuations don't matter with stocks at all-time highs...

3435 2018-08-24 19:43:33 Use small position size so you won't be emotionally on the line. Then don't chase, instead buy the dips in uptrending stocks. If you chase and buy the breakout then it dips and shakes you out. You have to learn to put risk in your favor
3436 2018-08-24 19:43:02 Autre nuance, des stocks on les obtient en s'engageant dans une entreprise, pas par héritage.
3437 2018-08-24 19:41:28 Hope so. It's difficult watching MJ stocks fly with too much money tied up here. My fault, not theirs
3438 2018-08-24 19:41:05 After Vegas:
Dems- Ban bump stocks
Trump, Rs and everyone else - YESSSSSS!!!!
Dems - Heres a law that bans bumpstocks (and every single other possible weapon modification)
Everyone but dems - thats not what we agreed on.
Dems - Trump supports terrorists and refuses to compromise!
3439 2018-08-24 19:41:02 If those really still are the NRA’s goals, they should have no problem with enacting stricter gun control. Age limits, background checks, waiting periods, bump stocks, assault weapons, etc. I am not against gun ownership. But we need common sense here.
3440 2018-08-24 19:40:57 I love how we are "WOW what that means"Stocks went up
3441 2018-08-24 19:40:42 Yes, this is a great idea. Some stocks or SIP can be started for sister.Common in western countries to gift stocks.

3444 2018-08-24 19:38:19 Definitely something to think about.. it has similar hype but Canada set to allow actual sale in October so stocks might jump to record highs for the big dogs like $cgc and $cron
3445 2018-08-24 19:33:06 Not to mention an already confirmed deal with AT&T

3450 2018-08-24 19:31:03 Right, this should all work out well in the end.

Unrelated: can anyone recommend some good ammunition-manufacturing stocks to invest in? Asking for a friend.

3467 2018-08-24 19:21:45 I'm only talking about bump stocks, not semi autos, not cars, not alcohol. 

Let me phrase it another way.

What's the purpose of a bump stock?

Why are full autos restricted?

Do you think you have the right to own a full auto without going thru Title III paperwork?

3486 2018-08-24 19:09:01 So Tim, if the DOW shows that the market is doing great, its better to swing trade or because penny stocks have pumps, its better to short sell? Or it all depends on the type of business the stock is involved?
3487 2018-08-24 19:08:54 ...18-19 exports drop another 50mb due to tariffs, then the 785mb-800mb area for ending stocks is more likely. 
And if that happens, than my technical view of cash soybeans in the $5 range may come to pass.

3491 2018-08-24 19:06:05 But that negates any value in Bitcoin that is attributed to scarcity. If a derivative product removes supply concern, why would Bitcoin ever hit its previous highs again? One could argue that options on equity stocks increase liquidity but liquidity doesn't drive price.

3496 2018-08-24 19:03:20 He fixed it alright. I guess you had a cushy, 6-figure, full time job w/free healthcare the whole time he was president, & made big$$$ on stocks? If you're right, we had all better be terrified, cuz Trump, is about to undo all that Bamanomics, & crash the economy any second now.

3540 2018-08-24 18:44:05 A set of stocks outside the main door. You put a pound in the lock which keeps them in place and lets you take a trolley, and then get money back and take kids when you leave.

Can’t see a downside.
3541 2018-08-24 18:43:53 Just bc your logic applies to cryptocurrencies (aka pump and dump scams) doesn’t mean it also applies to large cap stocks. CNBC shows 150 stocks per week at least.

3549 2018-08-24 18:40:26 No market will crash because you gave them that fucking tax cut which allowed corporations to artificially inflate their stocks.

When the market goes up, it's, 'not Trump, but when it 'falls', it's 'Trump derangement syndrome' all over again.
3689 2018-08-24 17:36:41 Blocks, Stocks & Real Estate
3690 2018-08-24 17:36:14 exactly! It's a little like the ForceShares 4x U.S. stocks ETFs that the SEC approved then, on review, decided to stay. They want to be innovative... but they also HAVE to err on the side of caution, because investor protection always comes first.
3691 2018-08-24 17:35:33 Almost all the stocks are up today, so far. Trump has been good to US investors. Dems have no clue about running the economy. @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews

3694 2018-08-24 17:34:02 Lots of lawsuits coming out against @facebook. What in the insider trading was occurring last month when their stocks dropped so much?
3695 2018-08-24 17:32:51 OK so the BIG thing that I noticed yesterday is on OTC stocks, when the panic stopped for a split second I noticed on the Time & Sales tape a lot of dark green prints where buyers are jumping above the best ask to buy the stock. That is indication of a bottom
3696 2018-08-24 17:32:46 If you want to make a quick $1k landing international development crashed 50% stocks at $3.15 rn
3697 2018-08-24 17:32:27 Lmfao.. YG stocks rose up when BP dropped their mini album
3698 2018-08-24 17:32:13 if anyone wants to talk abt physics, world economy and company stocks lets meet up at cafe that plays bangtan songs lol
3699 2018-08-24 17:31:34 .One question: If all investments are indexed, and investors panic, who will buy the stocks that passive index funds will suddenly need to sell? Even a smart strategy can fail if EVERYONE tries to follow it.

3701 2018-08-24 17:30:45 Points to remember before tweeting;

3) Quotas haven't conserved stocks. Having to discard & catch more to find what you can keep is opposite of conservation. 

Stocks have rebounded due to EU incompetence wiping out half the fleet, not due to quotas.

3714 2018-08-24 17:24:30 With some microcap stocks like $RDLG, stock price does not reflect the value of the company at all. That’s why we invest.
3715 2018-08-24 17:23:21 You still find the same with Penny Stocks. It’s absolutely normal & brazen over there 
3716 2018-08-24 17:22:44 That was the anticipated result but we have yet to see it, similar to people's wages were supposed to increase but large corporations instead used their savings to buy back stocks.
3717 2018-08-24 17:22:28 Wrong. Having to discard to find what you can keep to match a theoretical limit is causing overfishing not conservation. Stocks have risen due to EU incompetence wiping out half the fleet not because of quotas
3718 2018-08-24 17:22:01 The interesting thing that I find in CT is that most people blame the space with words like manipulation but not as part of the game but as if we re vicitims.

Funny since this goes back to many fields and the most similar one is Penny Stocks, Yet people think it’s only in Crypto
3719 2018-08-24 17:21:38 For the record, I’m not anti-gun. I am anti-NRA. I disapprove of guns in schools, with the exception of school resource officers. I see no point in owning “assault” weapons and bump stocks. And more guns are not the answer. I enjoy hunting and shooting competitions.
3720 2018-08-24 17:21:15 I want wooden stocks and not ripe tomato’s and horse manure. Right in front of one of his stupid towers.
3721 2018-08-24 17:21:13 BitMex hasn't done anything notably wrong so far as far as I can tell. If you want to become a federal prosecutor, start studying.

DEx gets good volume on Ethereum where the fare is mostly ERC20 penny stocks, Augurs fees are high. Maybe 1-2 years for next-gen to roll out.
3722 2018-08-24 17:20:40 What is so nice about this sector and the extremity is that our inside experts are not so many - can follow them all, just like the number of surviving turn around stocks - can buy them all ! 

And don’t forget what we all got front row seats for: “violent upside” !

3728 2018-08-24 17:17:29 I see his point. If he’s impeached, he will be indicted. If he’s in jail, the orange spray tan and Arby’s stocks will plummet. Thus economic failure.

3730 2018-08-24 17:15:33 You're moving it around, of course, from the rich, who will buy stocks with it in their 401k or whatever squirreling it away, and the poor will spend it almost immediately. Infusing an economy with money is a good thing, right?
3731 2018-08-24 17:15:25 I suggest flogging, followed by an hour in the stocks being pelted with stale cake

3755 2018-08-24 17:04:09 Sir, unprecedented level of manipulation.. very very few large cap select stocks now only qualify as long term hold. Most of the midcaps are firmly controlled by some group of operators

3764 2018-08-24 17:00:22 The average CEO up until the 80s made 20x their employees. Now they make 422x their employees!!!

Stocks may be going well but nobody has disposable income and local businesses suffer.

3777 2018-08-24 16:56:44 You know what the next POTUS is going to do? Jam stocks higher. Bc Americans freaking LOVE that. Think how much you like it as a Canadian and double it. That's how Americans feel about the freaking Dow. 

No matter what happens there's a good chance it's bullish.
3778 2018-08-24 16:55:50 It’s a mere tendency of people to find the fault in the stocks that weren’t in their portfolio and then went up manifolds; just a biased view to justify their ego. That’s the hard part about this. 
@liberatedsoul3 is as sarcastic about this as possible though.
3779 2018-08-24 16:55:13 Those traders are still working 9-5 jobs too. They clearly haven't been following me and investing in the stocks i have, specifically the last 5 years. Plenty of OTC companies price rises from sub penny and hold their gains. If you are short $RBIZ, you are about to be broke

3799 2018-08-24 16:48:47 Media needs to start investigating why GOP is silent. There is a reason outspoken Republicans have suddenly become Trump’s biggest advocates. After Trump’s market threat it’s clear they are tied to swampy Trump stocks.

3806 2018-08-24 16:43:40 I don’t buy that an easier Fed would be good for #stocks.  Which sends a scarier message: The Fed tightening because economic strength warrants it or the #Fed backing off because the economy isn’t strong enough to handle it? $SPX
3807 2018-08-24 16:42:23 Who cares when it was written. There are hundreds of articles on the topic. You do understand that Dow is reconstituted periodically, so the value toady is meaningless from say 5 or 10 years ago. It’s a rigged metric since they only pick stocks that are performing well.
3808 2018-08-24 16:42:02 Unfortunately, we don't offer futures. We offer commission-free trading on Stocks/ETFs, Options and Mutual Funds.
3809 2018-08-24 16:41:48 You mean just after the crash ?
But that continued and has been amplified since. It has only served to pump up stocks and asset prices so far. Not much sign of it hitting the real economy.
The test will come when they start buying the bonds back. The economy won't have recovered.

3817 2018-08-24 16:38:12 @OphirGottlieb I'm so sad :( Your data provider does have CGC (listed on the NYSE now - formerly just a Canadian marijuana stock).  STZ has purchased 39% of CGC at this point, fwiw.  Oh ... and the marijuana stocks have taken off in the last few days like a ruptured duck.
3818 2018-08-24 16:37:43 Elon Musk should stream pyrex princess for his stocks to go back up 
3819 2018-08-24 16:36:54 Stocks doing better today... keep it up!
3820 2018-08-24 16:36:37 The problem is that all stocks are valued in USD which is every day worthless
3821 2018-08-24 16:36:15 "We think this will be the longest Bull Market in U.S. history," says Kurt Spieler, CIO for wealth management at First National Bank of Omaha. Spieler sees the run sustained at the very least into 2019.

Dr_Stocks - Recession stops a Bull Market, I don’t see it in the near future
3822 2018-08-24 16:36:01 Stocks insurance was as sorry as Obamacare.
3823 2018-08-24 16:35:40 Sorry Rudy, there is no scenario I can think of that isn't bullish for stocks. #TheNewParadigm
3824 2018-08-24 16:34:40 Stocks are random time series that go from bottom left to top right, especially at 3:30PM
3825 2018-08-24 16:34:04 Can you substantiate anything you’re saying?  

You are obviously totally uninformed on ISIS—Obama said it would be a 10 yr problem when he left office and it was more like 10 months when Mattis got going.

Trump hired Mattis.

3826 2018-08-24 16:32:06 #FF - Profiles with <2,5k followers! They deserve much more …
 @Tischendorf - Great mentoring service! 
 @ChartingTrends - Super performance at Collective2! 
 @WishingWealth - 50+ years experience! 
 @LordFamara - Trend following on super stocks! 
3827 2018-08-24 16:31:55 Please mother fucker. National and international stocks would rise. Plus! Our economy would get a boost because of the money being spent domestically on all the Trump Is Gone parties.
3828 2018-08-24 16:31:22 *I look back at my laptop looking at the stocks for my starting business and smiles in approval before taking another glance at you, when I see Mia walk in and move over to your table taking a seat across from you*M:so you're the one that got my brother to talk
3829 2018-08-24 16:31:16 Bernie, you are full of s#!! and you are a #hypocrite since you profit from Amazon as you own their stocks!!
3830 2018-08-24 16:31:00 what is the margin difference btw both....stocks follow profits
3831 2018-08-24 16:30:52 I'd rather lose a few stocks...and gain back democracy!!
3832 2018-08-24 16:29:52 Any Cannabis Canadian stocks I should probably keep an eye on this year?
3833 2018-08-24 16:28:31 Stocks and index generally 60% sideways....so risk 40%....in this 40%....there is two buffer...
1. Premium &
2. Spot price is Below strike price (subject to choose)
If, you wrong and price is behaving against you then still you have to time to escape with minimum loss/profit
3834 2018-08-24 16:27:13 Holy shiet! All stocks i follow are green with exception of 2! Cant remember last time I saw this! FALL IS COMING BUCKLE UPP!!
3835 2018-08-24 16:27:13 Nice stocks, but dont you think the American dollar is expensive these days to buy US stocks with the Euro we make in Europe?
3836 2018-08-24 16:26:42 Just bought stocks of food and bath products etc before departing to UK in a little more than two weeks. And I have to say, I didn't see it coming that I would want to buy another @wardahbeauty Instaperfect cushion to stock up for a year. It's beautiful inside out.

3843 2018-08-24 16:24:51 Save it and your thoughts and prayers too. Your Org has blocked every common sense thing we have tried to do. Mental health. background checks. bump stocks. armor piercing bullets and then you all took money from Putin & a spy to help you. Do everyone a favor, just go away.
3844 2018-08-24 16:24:15 There's alot of cool shit there, but my local store definitely stocks maybe 5 times as many pop figures.
3845 2018-08-24 16:23:22 stocks is stocks
3846 2018-08-24 16:23:09 Abbott in cabinet, what a joke. Rewarding appalling behaviour.....he should be placed in stocks in the Parliamentary forecourt.
3847 2018-08-24 16:23:04 My mom cant stop talking about her Marijuana stocks she invested in. Chill out.
3848 2018-08-24 16:22:55 99% of ICO's r scams like penny stocks. ICO's r shell companies dat try to skate the rules of funding by offering "tokens" instead of Stocks. The SEC should label companies with ICO's securities & force them to list on OTC stock markets if they dont meet NYSE/NASDAQ requirements.
3849 2018-08-24 16:22:48 I believe US stocks are moving due to Trump admin. looking into protectionist measures for US producers and uncertainty for the rest of the producers worldwide.  I would hope that Canadian producers/developers would also benefit from this environment. I am long NXE.

3851 2018-08-24 16:22:01 If I am full invested I switch to a "management mode". I only add a new #trading position if another is closed. I sell weak stocks and replace them with stronger one and I add to my winners.
3852 2018-08-24 16:21:53 People like  "Allen Weisselberg" and #Cohen and many others in Trump's orbit, have had many yrs of profits and good times - and just like stocks that balloon bc the investors believe the good times will never end, balloon ALWAYS pops. 

Had DT not been greedy, not run for POTUS??
3853 2018-08-24 16:21:40 Dumping to fomo into pot stocks then fomo back into crypto in the winter ?
3854 2018-08-24 16:21:13 I thought I would when I sold 25% of my position in $CGC at $37.88 but right now its looking like that won't happen. Tbh I have actually taken a lot of profit but I've put most of it into names that weren't moving like TGOD and APH as well as some penny stocks like XLY and ICC
3855 2018-08-24 16:20:43 Generally stocks react very badly to bad news than react good to good news as fear is always bigger than greed. Even a 5% gap up can clean shorts. Only hedge positions are less risky
3856 2018-08-24 16:20:00 How does these stocks react so strongly to this idiot's comments? Difficult to understand
3857 2018-08-24 16:19:51 You are trying to take credit for what Obama did. Dow Stocks went up 13,000 points under Obama, tripling the index, and the unemployment rate dropped steadily and went blow 5% before he finished. You're a fraud.
3858 2018-08-24 16:19:25 $NFLX up $6 billion market cap today because buy tech stocks
3859 2018-08-24 16:19:13 I had ordered 10 ac units but the store manager was so lazy that he didnt care to even send official proforma even after 4 reminders eventually aftr 5 days the sales guy calls and tells that we have no stocks thats the Jamnagar stor
3860 2018-08-24 16:19:08 @cvpayne Charles do you have a book out for those of us that are just learning to trade stocks? Signs to look for, strategies, economics...?
3861 2018-08-24 16:18:56 Hell, there were MANY Reps who were saying the SAME! Remember, this was in the BUSH era! STOP with the Dem finger pointing! BOTH parties were responsible for the housing bubble AND banking crisis! When tech stocks failed, they all pushed housing!!!!!!
3862 2018-08-24 16:18:50 Norway is LONG oil. Why do they want $40 bln in oil stocks?
3863 2018-08-24 16:18:10 @realDonaldTrump you made many enemies starting from the campain...too many put downs, nasty remarks no wonder why people hate you..we don't care anympore about your so-called tribulations..your trials are approaching now...guess i should be glad I don't have any stocks~

3867 2018-08-24 16:16:53 @CabotAnalysts should I sell my CVNA stocks? It keeps going up and am worried the stock is going to drastically decline soon.
3868 2018-08-24 16:16:43 several super expensive/ loss making tech and healthcare stocks are going parabolic....insanity ...

3870 2018-08-24 16:16:30 A context thread.
Started when I was 19 (2015) with internship money.

First play was US pharma stocks with cannabis drugs in pipeline
GWPH, CARA, ABBV, INSY

3871 2018-08-24 16:16:21 Pot stocks continue to rip. Crazy action. $CGC $WEED.TO $CRON
3872 2018-08-24 16:15:55 No weed stocks?
3873 2018-08-24 16:15:46 When investing in stocks, look for:
1. The most compelling story
2. The most ethical and competent management

Even if you pay a price which seems high in the near term, you'll get excellent return over the long term.

3874 2018-08-24 16:15:44 #MarketWatch Stocks jump after Fed Chairman's speech at Jackson Hole Symposium. Jerome Powell confirms the Central Bank will continue hiking interest rates until they reach a balance that neither stimulates or slows the economy, says economic strength supports the hikes.
3875 2018-08-24 16:15:35 EU logic - if fish are killed and thrown back into the sea it protects fish stocks in a way it wouldn't if they were landed as food.
3876 2018-08-24 16:14:51 Scottish Borders, Aberdeenshire, and Southwest - How are silage stocks? This rain seeing grass respond? Making you a bit less concerned? Just trying to get a better gauge. Hear some worrying stories, while some are now more relaxed. Big mix, but defo do big surpluses.
3877 2018-08-24 16:13:54 Living in Asia is seeing the first third/half of the day. Most of What I trade (US Stocks/Metals/FX related to the $) is Dollar related, hence my DXY tweets. In these the action happens after the US opens (8:30pm here). I hate it so much
3878 2018-08-24 16:13:53 CrossFit, hands down.... invest in any pain med stocks for future.

3880 2018-08-24 16:13:26 @CronosGroupMJN is about to hit double digits wow #Marijuana #CRON #Stocks
3881 2018-08-24 16:13:13 When he got elected, I dumped most of my stocks. Most of them have since doubled. Which was as good a sign that I shouldn’t play at the stock market as any. (They were worth like $300, but still.)
3882 2018-08-24 16:13:04 Though Bank Nifty is correcting, RBL Bank and Axis bank hit 52 weeks high last week.

Buy Axis Bank 640 CE @ 12

Target  18  Stop loss  6

Logic: On thursay it touched 52 weeks high of 643 and it corrected thereafter. Next day it traded within this range . It is very bullish.
3883 2018-08-24 16:12:59 I didn't realize that rate hikes were bullish for stocks.
3884 2018-08-24 16:12:43 If these pot stocks keep going like they’re it will turn in a hurry. This has been an incredible 2 week run
3885 2018-08-24 16:12:29 The top five stocks lower at noon today are $FL, $GPS, $M, $PM, and $KR.

3890 2018-08-24 16:10:46 The top five most active stocks at noon today are $AMD, $GDP, $BAC, $GE, and $MU.
3891 2018-08-24 16:10:10 Reasonable gun control measures (bump stocks, kill the gun show loophole etc) and E-verify for a sealed (and I mean sealed) border with legal immigration (the folks we decide to let in) tied to labor needs and demand.
3892 2018-08-24 16:09:38 Do you own any stocks?

3894 2018-08-24 16:07:53 Should one sell once target is achieved?? Can we assume u guys sold out at levels mentioned ? Or u keep a database of such screenshots and post when stocks surge??? #mainebolathana
3895 2018-08-24 16:07:45 EU  fish factory vessels have torn the fish life out of the English Channel. Our South Coast Fishermen have been put out of work because of low fish stocks.  The EU does not do sustainable fishing.
3896 2018-08-24 16:07:02 That's your stocks and 401k. Mine did very well under Obama and continuing to do well under Trump. You fail to understand that he took over for a economy that tanked under Bush. Brought it back and started currently the longest bull market in history!
3897 2018-08-24 16:06:57 @timseymour Tim love your cannabis segenents on CNBC! Do you think it’s wise to diversify cannabis plays by investing in a company like $mcig as an alternative to the more traditional stocks like $cron, $cgc, $tlry? Thanks!
3898 2018-08-24 16:06:46 $IDXG 1.25 so far
3899 2018-08-24 16:05:36 Hi Krunal - thanks for the feedback, you're looking for details for the stocks in these smallcases or the entire smallcase?
3900 2018-08-24 16:05:28 What is more scary is with bail in clause, your savings account amount will be converted into   stocks of the banks at much lower value.   You loose whatever you have God Forbid!
3901 2018-08-24 16:05:05 @todd_harrison Todd your thoughts on the cannabis market is top notch. Do you think investing in a company like $mcig is a good alternative play instead of the more traditional stocks like $cron, $cgc, $tlry?
3902 2018-08-24 16:04:54 New highs today with ridiculously low volume. Yesterday's vol was low, but as of now, it is running 12.6% LESS than yesterday.

3905 2018-08-24 16:04:03 apple of cars is intellectually lazy.  I saw this stuff in late 1990’s, where ideas/concepts were massively over-priced, and Tesla is at the top of heap of story stocks.  Tesla doesn’t a. operate in a vacuum; b. is lead by an easily distracted CEO.
3906 2018-08-24 16:03:52 The same people who tell you it is impossible to deport 20+ million illegals somehow think it is possible to simply get the 500,000,000+ guns & 15,000,000,000,000 rds of ammo out of the hands of private owners. Bump stocks were mandated to be turn in in MA & CT. Of 16k, 3 were.
3907 2018-08-24 16:03:35 Why trade cryptos when you have 100% + moves in stocks under 5$ daily.

3919 2018-08-24 15:59:41 I trade forex via ETFs. Other than that, it's mostly stocks and options. I booked an amazing deal on commissions with TD a few years ago. I don't pay the ticket charge for options. Ever since, I've never looked back.
3920 2018-08-24 15:59:16 3million people kicked off of health care ,93k+ jobs outsourced,60k homeless vets,and 80% of the stocks are own by the top 10% yup the Rick keeps getting rich while the deficit continues to skyrocket. Good job in fucking over the middle n lower class to help ur rich buddy's .

3929 2018-08-24 15:55:57 Yes but mostly wont stay long in these stocks and they definitely wont buy it as penny stock
3930 2018-08-24 15:55:50 Lowest volume means if we get 5 stocks as 3IB from daily OHLC sheet, then we need to select lowest traded qty from that 5 stock ? 
Am I right ? Or correct me if i misunderstood.

4066 2018-08-24 15:12:11 Don't believe those reports. No one can validate them. Wealth that cannot be measured in stocks, cash balance, real estates,art collections, jets, automobiles should be discountenanced. Real wealth is measurable and specific.

4086 2018-08-24 15:03:12 As for the market reaction, $DXY is down, $SPY is up $GLD is up, and now even $TLT is up. Beyond the IMMEDIATE reaction, I expect over the longer term that this will lead to 1) More curve flattening 2) Ongoing outperformance of "Safe Money" stocks and 3) Dollar gains
4087 2018-08-24 15:01:47 Hey jc—what would be your counter to the following:  “only 5% of NYSE stocks hit ATHs, while 40% of US stocks are below their 200-DMAs. That may change, but here, divergent internals matter => subtle increase in risk-aversion. “Catalysts” appear later.”

4124 2018-08-24 14:52:45 Some stocks are great chart examples to use your favorite option strategy but their Open Interest OI Option volume is so small and bid-ask spreads so wide that you have to move on. You will not get good prices.

4128 2018-08-24 14:51:37 Sometimes the big wirehouses have a "do not buy" list, with stocks on it that are considered by the bank as too risky for people to own.

4199 2018-08-24 14:24:21 Hi Cath, thank you so much for thinking of us. We have had a lot of donations but stocks are still low.
4200 2018-08-24 14:24:04 Well, Powell's comments turned the day around for the moment.  I hope anyone who was long the 14450 put got out with my last Tweet. If not, the day remains young.  Stocks appear to like comments so far which could turn bonds back down any second.  It's like watching a horse race!

4205 2018-08-24 14:22:56 Well, to be honest, the stocks have been pretty stagnant this year too..... actually the DOW is down about 1000 since February. Worst year for growth since 2010. Full disclosure... NEVER was a Trump Supporter.

4210 2018-08-24 14:21:58 Significant, structurally important damage to investor psyche over the last 18 yrs. 

The dot bomb, recession, 9/11, '08 housing crisis & Great Financial Crisis (2 yr depression, in fact). Hard to fault anyone for avoiding stocks.

But it's a major reason to be bullish #sentiment

4245 2018-08-24 14:09:31 You have a narrow scope & misunderstanding of gun reform. @NRA induced "gun culture" has lead to those people owning guns, sowed a society that thinks problems are solved w/guns. Access to lethal weapons w/high capacity magazines, bump stocks, no red flag laws all played role.

4293 2018-08-24 13:54:44 I did. Haven't updated it in years and would have to search to find it, but I "bought" the 10 Dow stocks with the lowest PE from June to June, it killed the DJIA and buying the 10 with the highest PE.
4294 2018-08-24 13:54:25 Yeah, but what the hell..all the poor people can sell their stocks short and make a killing. See, CRAZY isn't all that hard.
4295 2018-08-24 13:54:10 I could be wrong, however, with WTI artificially inflating stocks this morning in the attempt to get a big short-cover into #JacksonHole18, it will come at the consquence of air pockets, that is if the ploy does not work -- the market will reverse quick b/c auction is weak

If/when he's impeached, I think the #Resistance should chip in and invest big-time in stocks like Starbucks just to prove the bastard wrong.
4313 2018-08-24 13:47:41 Or they didn’t act on guns because the gun didn’t kill those people. The mental guy behind the gun did. And they definitely banned bump stocks.
4314 2018-08-24 13:47:34 @realDonaldTrump  Fewer than 1/2 of the American people own stocks, even incl. those with 401Ks. Half of Americans could care less if the markets would crash if you were impeached. They are much more concerned with the inflation and higher interest rates due to your tariffs.
4315 2018-08-24 13:47:08 By the way I have stocks to and since trump took office I’m up almost 6 %. Tell me again what’s so bad about trumps economy.
4316 2018-08-24 13:46:55 FoxNews is the only place where normal Americans can get the truth. Hence their ratings. The fake networks actually had the balls to use the "I" word hundreds of times this week over imaginary bullshit. And they wonder why they're laughing stocks.

4328 2018-08-24 13:41:47 If you think about it rationally, investors should go for lower end stocks for better deals. You can buy triple the worth of value of shares for the same price as you will buy one blue chip stock. This spreads your investments and your market share holdings. Half the risk.
4329 2018-08-24 13:40:55 Thanks for sharing your hard work. I guess it is coincidental that 50% are bullish and 50% are Bearish. May I know the parameters considered in classifying the stocks as bullish/ Bearish? Probably I missed your earlier tweets on that topic.

4349 2018-08-24 13:34:06 Yes. They had a very long segment on the terrible consequences of stock buybacks last night. It seems the really bad part is that stockholders benefit while people who don't own stocks see very little. It was also the 1st story I've ever seen about this issue in business news.
4350 2018-08-24 13:34:04 Or maybe a partial deal has actually been made...Chinese also announced scrap of ownerships caps on financials which was big push for US, explains the rip in HK & SH stocks this morning, the headline of no deal progress doesn’t seem right to me.

That may change, but here, divergent internals matter => subtle increase in risk-aversion. “Catalysts” appear later.

4439 2018-08-24 12:55:13 there is no reasonable discussion with morons who refuse to see the most obvious pattern in all of penny stocks, keep thinking it's about fundamentals and ignoring the email promos that spiked the stock 30x, it's your own grave and I have tolerance for idiocy/laziness

4561 2018-08-24 11:48:05 Stay with front line stocks. Learn markets and then only invest or trade.
4562 2018-08-24 11:47:43 i ordered the black glitter backpack from dan and phil shop when they had that ‘every bag comes with a signed thing while stocks last’
4563 2018-08-24 11:45:16 Good strategy IMO. 

I tend to think LT macro positive ($TCHEY):
- ads and consumer culture is more permissive in china
- allure of tech hardware tech waning, shifting to software (ai/autonomos)
- lack of better domestic stocks (although domestic mandates can easily go to re etc)

Actually is at least a 30 year trend, (I think it close to 40). The S&P is really only an indicator of a handful of US stocks anyway

4580 2018-08-24 11:34:57 Nothing works 100 percent of the time. 

How often do stocks like APPL, AMZN, LMT, or any large cap move 1 standard deviation in a day. 

IV also can't stay elevated. I always put positions on with 40-60 days to exp. That gives you the ability to roll the position for credit.

4596 2018-08-24 11:20:36 Wages are stagnant. Many people working 2 jobs to make ends meet. Millions of people have no health insurance and the big tax cuts were used to buy back stocks and record major profits. Working people can't catch a break.

4689 2018-08-24 09:56:56 They don't back up any of their assertions with facts.  What research have they done on their Norway or Iceland operations?  Because most of the papers I find talk of fish stocks plummeting.  No one is measuring the loss of a significant carbon absorber.

4691 2018-08-24 09:55:54 The point here is not privatization vs nationalization. The point here that the guys who were supposed to check on the status of that bridge was a private company who is now getting their concession removed and are sinking in stocks.

4722 2018-08-24 09:22:56 But what about fishing quotas? 
What they don't tell you when bringing that right-wing talking point up is that it's designed to safeguard fish stocks for stability of the industry, & it's less than 0.5 of UK GDP, while we lose our biggest trading partner and billions of £'s.

4823 2018-08-24 07:36:42 131. There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
4824 2018-08-24 07:36:41 If you didn’t get the memo. Investments in anything have risk. Stocks, Real Estate, precious metals.... but Cryptocurrency is High Risk and High reward. If you have not accepted that by now then.... You know the saying; if you can’t take the heat then step up out the Kitchen!!
4825 2018-08-24 07:35:47 je confirme ! (je la garde pour moi et ne la prête à personne, les stocks de confitures sont limités )

4834 2018-08-24 07:30:37 The post really emanated from the fact I'm well used to stocks like this moving (say) 4-6% in a day then settling, but these moves were 15% (except WTC & ALU with 30% spurts). That's not normal - there was nothing in the results to justify a 50% price move in WTC over 2 days.

4853 2018-08-24 07:16:47 $HMNY  It's mandatory for a stock to be dead to skyrocket. Hugest shoot ups always come from dead stocks. Penny stocks are ALL manipulation and speculation in both directions and not in line or even against fundamentals. This could and should bounce historically hard.

The rule of 72 is a shortcut to estimate the number of years required to double your money at a given annual rate of return. The rule states that you divide the rate, expressed as a percentage, into 72.

4946 2018-08-24 05:46:39 Specially with PSU Stocks like Coal like where government is ready to dilute stakes. Any day news can come & you will lose good 4-5% without any reason.
4947 2018-08-24 05:46:10 $URA only has a 0.69% annual fee this is IMO low to manage a good portfolio of #Uranium & Nuclear component stocks.  Plus look at the Dividend history I am expecting a big dividend in December. As the only ETF in sector the last two bull runs in 2007 & 2011 saw a great upside!

4968 2018-08-24 05:25:25 You need to get away from penny stocks and learn to trade proper stocks. Not 1 slow day this summer trading large caps.

4970 2018-08-24 05:24:28 True. I think you should look at Clenow's momentum strategy which has some rules on exiting momentum stocks and giving volatility based weightage. This reduces the drawdowns much better compared to pure momentum & re-balancing portfolios.

4972 2018-08-24 05:24:08 Thanks for this. I am still trying to figure out “why” stocks move when there is no new information.  I want to believe people are making informed decisions but it seems like there is just an ebb and flow like the tides moving up & down until real news hits.
4973 2018-08-24 05:23:35 I made so much last decade I stopped work to trade stocks
4974 2018-08-24 05:22:06 Hexaware - The only reason I am not comfortable taking positions overnight. With a Lot Size of 1500, even if anyone went long at yesterday's low and carried positions into market open they would have lost 60k. This is not Black swan event. It happens frequently with many stocks.

5044 2018-08-24 04:30:41 Securities are taxed differently than other revenue, so if I sell $20,000 worth of stocks in a calendar year and don't buy more, I am taxed at a rate equivalent to $20,000, even though the value of my portfolio might only have increased by $1k that year.  It happens.

5055 2018-08-24 04:15:11 We don’t discuss stocks specifically as it contravenes SEBI rules. The fund is managed with many stocks of which some turn out to be multi baggers &some would be laggards, a natural progression of fund management.

5061 2018-08-24 04:10:11 Trump is correct. Here's why.
Consumer Confidence.
When people have Hope & Confidence in the future, they do things like:
buy a new Vehicle, vacation, buy, sell & trade stocks, start businesses & SPEND money !
When people are fearful, they don't invest their wealth, old car etc !
5062 2018-08-24 04:09:06 Sometimes this happens with stocks too 
5063 2018-08-24 04:08:20 Black business ownership has been going up since 2010. Same thing with labor participation, and stocks Black and Hispanic unemployment has been declining since then as well.  NK Satellite images show dismantlment has stopped, Pompeo says talks are at a deadlock.

5079 2018-08-24 03:57:49 Do you even think about your own responses before posting? The NRA lobbied for guns like ARs and things like bump stocks to be legal. So yes, it is an argument to blame the NRA, and it’s not to blame all immigrants because of one person. Not that difficult to figure out.
5080 2018-08-24 03:56:36 If someone is willing to pay $100, that is its value. That's how markets work. We see this in stocks all of the time. Values rise and fall.

5095 2018-08-24 03:42:47 And I would hardly call the economy booming despite what has been said. Stocks are up, as is the GDP. Those don't mean jack for the average American, who struggles with debt, bills, and works too hard for too small a paycheck. Life is getting better for the few, not the many.

Thinks tanks have written @ immigration & wages showing minimal effect in both positive & negative directions
5111 2018-08-24 03:32:53 I guess that explains why I have more money to do what I want with then. I'm happy with that. I'm also happy that the va is actually treating me better for my disabilities. I'm also happy that Trump made my stocks go up tremendously. More money in my pocket I guess.
5112 2018-08-24 03:32:17 I’ve swapped incessantly checking Twitter and Instagram for incessantly checking my stocks. I’m different now. I think money is great.
5113 2018-08-24 03:31:34 My unpopular Smash opinion: homie stocks in friendlies are the ultimate way of saying "I care about stocks"

5115 2018-08-24 03:29:55 Any idea of fresh stocks?
5116 2018-08-24 03:28:05 Stocks not tradeable are ones that have no avg volume. Not sure how much though. Once it trades lots of volume sometimes the stock becomes tradeable mid day or definitely next day. Once tradeable. Always tradeable = formers runners always will be tradeable.
5117 2018-08-24 03:27:19 It already crashed for me. My auto stocks are down 20% this year due to his dumb trade games.
5118 2018-08-24 03:27:06 ND stocks report as of 7/31 should be out in a couple weeks.  I think there’ll be plenty but definitely shortened up the 18 crop with recent weather.
5119 2018-08-24 03:26:48 In all fairness ... When Obama took over, the market could only go up. But up 149% is one hell of a climb. And it's still going. Trump doesn't understand stocks enough to know he didn't cause it.

5130 2018-08-24 03:21:17 I get that this will sound market toppish , but growth and value are not mutually exclusive. Growth is one of the inputs that determines value. But it isn’t growth vs value.

5144 2018-08-24 03:09:09 The stocks will react to uncertainty but they’ll go back up. Once again Trump overestimates his influence. I’m willing to ride out a slump.
5145 2018-08-24 03:08:31 Everyone needs to do their own thing but my research made me believe that if you don’t need the money for 10+ years you just keep putting your money in and forget about it.  When a correction happens during a bull market, you’re buying stocks on sale.  Buy low, sell high.

5221 2018-08-24 02:13:27 Billy: However, Dr. Hussman makes the point that stocks are a claim to long-term cashflows of that company. Record profit margins, lower taxes etc. exist NOW, but it is a mistake to assume that they will remain elevated forever. Hussman as wrong about how LONG, agreed.

5226 2018-08-24 02:10:17 Good response. But where might it end?

Fed's job is to think ahead.

Should stocks go down 10%= amazing values, almost every position.

A scare might be productive.

Printing money (now) risks Weimar scenario?

If your response (above) is correct, US in best shape  vs. others.

5289 2018-08-24 01:38:51 No, I just find it insane when people keep shorting stocks when they're oversold. They lost 20 bucks in a couple of weeks. I'll bet you this, $WEED is not going to be trading at $74 in two weeks. Way less risky shorting overbought. Less risky, but doesn't mean not loser anyway.
5290 2018-08-24 01:35:58 And I'm so tired of hearing about the economy. The reality is his policies had nothing to do with the status of the economy in 2017, it's a laggard to previous policies (fact check on his policies: stocks are flat for the year, wages are down).

5302 2018-08-24 01:29:34 The best is asking some newly minted college grad w/a degree in finance why stocks go up and listening to them wax prosaic about fundamental  value, DCF, free cash flow, etc. Uh, more buyers than sellers. That's it, nothing more, nothing less.
5303 2018-08-24 01:29:30 What "Great job"? Look at the deficit, debt and inflation you're creating to pump the economy temporarily. Wages for hardworking people are going down while millionaires are getting richer & corporations are buying back stocks instead of investing or increasing wages of workers.
5304 2018-08-24 01:27:54 This has been a darn good week for my stocks & I.
5305 2018-08-24 01:26:06 Stocks and mutual funds etc can also go down in value and your money in there today is not the same as it will be tomorrow based on inflation. So how do u draw a line in the sand?
5306 2018-08-24 01:24:29 Corp. profits as % of GDP is highest since 1929, going to top 10% that own over 80% of stocks, all while wages as % of GDP has fallen 8 %pts in the last 50 yrs.

5311 2018-08-24 01:23:08 What kinds of jobs are being filled? What are the wages of said jobs? How many people have any actual and financial interests in stocks? The answers to those questions will lead you to the ACTUAL truth. My silence was because I had a business to run. Not because you’re right.
5312 2018-08-24 01:22:06 ..... Not sure what recording and stocks have in common. You lost me there. But I can't record this week.
5313 2018-08-24 01:21:48 Chinese fuel ethanol industry is expanding quickly in the recent two years and there are still massive local corn stocks need to be consumed. So not very likely to import ethanol in large volume in short term. But after the local corn stocks are consumed, import is for sure.
5314 2018-08-24 01:20:27 US GDP is ~65% consumption.

IRS data = Net Capital Gains + Taxable IRA distributions = 200% of Annual US Consumption (PCE) growth.  Translation?

Rising stocks = strong US Econ, rising US tax receipts

Flat stocks = weak US econ, falling receipts 

Falling stocks = catastrophe
5315 2018-08-24 01:18:57 But I never bashed him while he was president because he was my president.  Here is the difference you bash on daily basis, and lives are much better today.  Jobs, income, taxes, GDP, Stocks.  If your not in that group, I’d recommend turning in your EBT card.
5316 2018-08-24 01:18:55 Higher interest rates are better than stocks and investment trusts.
5317 2018-08-24 01:18:11 What about the Vegas shooting? Murder is murder. Trouble is Trump wanted to politicize the news. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick: the blood from Vegas shooting is on the NRA. And Bump Stocks are still legal. That’s pathetic. Vote out the GOP.
5318 2018-08-24 01:17:36 Let’s take it to stocks...”past performance is not indicative of future results.” I don’t think he can be fired cause someone else was fired for less.

5320 2018-08-24 01:16:50 That has no meaning in currencies. If BTC went to $1MM per BTC, the market cap means nothing, it’s simply how much value can 1 person exchange value for value. You can’t spend stocks, they represent an investment. Currency changing forms is still currency. The cap is infinite.

5323 2018-08-24 01:15:08 Corp. profits as % of GDP is highest since 1929, going to top 10% that own over 80% of stocks, all while wages as % of GDP has fallen 8 %pts in the last 50 yrs.

The average worker can't eat the aggregate GDP - distribution matters.

(also, log scale exponential growth, please)
5324 2018-08-24 01:14:31 Put your money where your mouth is and stop complaining- Sell your property, stocks, deplete your bank accounts and fund existing homeless shelters...or create a new one. That should help for a bit anyways. Contrary to what you may believe, some people prefer homelessness.

5329 2018-08-24 01:11:54 Precisely. Strong Fed. Strong dollar. Strong country. Let the stocks correct. 10% is nothing, Ditto 18%. 30% and problems start.

5339 2018-08-24 01:03:46 It’s possible for any crypto to reach any price. The reason why market cap is important with stocks is because there is a finite amount of wealth in this world and only so much can go towards each public company. Currency is different, one is just expressed in the terms of other
5340 2018-08-24 01:02:54 Since these kids started, 26 states passed gun control laws in <5months. Bump stocks banned in 9 states (&counting). ~250K voters registered by gun control groups. You are right to fear them; if this keeps up, the next thing is to take all your guns away.

5343 2018-08-24 01:02:11 What I am referring to are the flows. Stocks can be misleading because this is an average over time. It is easily possible that the US was relatively attractive, but no longer is. Eg. you had net emigration after WWII from Germany to the US.
5344 2018-08-24 01:02:02 @realDonaldTrump and Ronald Reagen have destroyed the economy in fa or of the ultra rich. 
His tax cut has allowed all the rich to buy back stocks and cash out.

5390 2018-08-24 00:29:56 Trump's policy of tax cuts has superheated not the economy in general only the stock market. Corporate profits are artificially high due to the buy back of stocks raising prices over the short term. It will crash hard, look at history, it has happened before

5402 2018-08-24 00:18:44 All of them. Real estate has topped out along with stocks. Without losses there can’t be gains.

5408 2018-08-24 00:15:27 They used their tax cuts to artificially inflate their stocks. They could afford to give their employees benefits, give them a wage high enough so they don't have to rely on food stamps, and give them a bonus without the tax cuts.

5414 2018-08-24 00:11:15 Hold on a second, a buyback may not increase overall value of a company, but raises its share price. Insofar as the index reflect performance of stocks, rather than total $ mkt cap, the first paragraph may be correct.

The second though... idiotic indeed.
