38 2018-07-03 22:25:39 The problem is here “...NAFTA is that it offered free trade in subsidised commodities” that isn’t free trade. It’s the US supporting its special interest through governemt intervention.

40 2018-07-03 22:16:22 Loable, pero estos certificados son “commodities”. En USA los llamamos “Renewable Energy Certificates”, o green tags, y solo hay que googlear “renewable energy certificates scam” para saber la verdad. Creo recordar que  Iberdrola fue el primero en importar la idea a España.

43 2018-07-03 22:04:13 The problem with NAFTA is that it offered free trade in subsidised commodities. How could Mexican farmers compete with US ag commodities sold below the cost of production?

49 2018-07-03 21:28:34 It’s comical that media types throw subtle shade at the Spurs for not feeding into NBA offseason frenzy and trading a bonafide top 5 player (whom they developed themselves) for unproven commodities outside of Kyrie.

55 2018-07-03 20:29:09 Hey...a non-GMO, preservative and  gluten-free chicken salad with fresh guacamole and a charged phone are commodities.
56 2018-07-03 20:28:01 If “it don’t cost nothing”, then it must cost something.

Maybe it costs time and energy? Those are valuable commodities when you have children (especially a newborn), are dealing with a potentially deadly health crisis, have lost your job, and are having to navigate transition.
57 2018-07-03 20:21:27 Adding to this, very close proximity of surrounding mines such as Force commodities provides even greater support for TINCI to jump in. Coupled with cheap opex in the region, it sounds like an investment dream for TINCI

82 2018-07-03 17:37:15 My take is that they pick up their Mauss from the situationists, who really amp up the primitivism (not that it's not there in Mauss already), and thus end up with a bad read on the relationship between gifts and commodities, which decades-old econ anth would have helped with.

85 2018-07-03 17:16:18 I think utilities should be free, like why should you have to pay for commodities, such as running water, electricity, gas, the government should provide it for free and companies shouldn't be allowed to charge people for it.

149 2018-07-03 13:29:06 My views for H2 are the same as they have been for a while. I think USD will depreciate (e.g. EURUSD up) with stocks and commodities going up.

180 2018-07-03 11:16:17 Supply management remains a sensitive issue, always an issue when negotiating a trade deals, creates dissent amongst domestic commodity groups  re price protection which other commodities have to compete against on every level etc, etc..

183 2018-07-03 11:03:30 US risk markets such as equities and credit have weakened while the dollar has rallied in a negative environment. The commodities rally, credited for helping the dollar tick higher, is driven by trade tensions and other geopolitical worries rather than global demand...

230 2018-07-03 07:35:58 Great question. I am less convinced about commodities in general into a slowdown.
231 2018-07-03 07:30:08 What part you don't get it? The women, the cocaine or the imperial idea (and the current mindset) that some countries are there to supply commodities to the educated and civilised nations?
232 2018-07-03 07:28:25 y pensar que podríamos ver a Lula otra vez de presidente asusta un poco... el tiempo ha demostrado que durante su mandato no hizo mucho, aprovechó el tirón del crecimiento global, sobre todo commodities... sobre AMLO, prioridades corrupción y violencia, creo estaréis de acuerdo

238 2018-07-03 06:47:15 Agreed. Underlying commodities for both coming off a little into summer have only provided opportunity. #ARS and #HZM always deliver strongly, have strong newsflow with all important BFS deliveries approaching too.

242 2018-07-03 06:26:34 If you read my tweet again,you will see that I am not comparing commodities,but the utility they offer. It's clear that different things have different value,but none the less,I also think we are paying a too big of a premium, we are donating too much to these companies profits.

244 2018-07-03 06:17:45 Its better to avoid commodities during bear markets.
245 2018-07-03 06:17:33 There is NO SUCH THING as fractional reserve banking. It's a fairy tale. Credit is created ad hoc by bookkeeping, without regard of "reserves".
Trad money systems WERE credit - 5000 years ago.
Fixed Exch rules ARE "fiat" mandates, price-fixing numbers to shiny rocks/commodities.
246 2018-07-03 06:11:12 The ones with the greatest understanding of the international commodities market will, I hope. However, I don't trust that there are enough of them, and I fear this could have long term effects on our food production industry.  It can take a very long time to bounce back.

 Banks- can shut you out of your own monies at their choosing.
Commodities/stocks- Can crash/can go to 0/or lose immense value (Lehman/enron/etc)
Crypto- BTC id say would be a closer second to RE but crypto in for the most part speculative.
Can definitely go to 0...or close.
248 2018-07-03 06:02:13 Each place has its problems Bree but we really do need better stewards in ALL sectors. It's hard to picture a sector that doesn't need revamping. These issues are mostly because of a less than human lens people are valued from. We became commodities long ago even to one another.
249 2018-07-03 05:58:38 Comparing the use of 2 commodities based merely on their market value is so medieval. Everyone has different priorities and hence value things differently. Your value of certain commodities will be different to others. Not that difficult to get your head around it, I hope.
250 2018-07-03 05:58:22 And that could happen with other commodities, too. 
Let's not even talk about the ripple effect that all this could have.

261 2018-07-03 04:43:14 Historically, there has been a bull market in the commodities every 20 or 30 years.
262 2018-07-03 04:39:26 I feel bad for PH. They probably have to compromise on some of their mandates especially the rise in price of certain commodities to help reduce our national debt.
263 2018-07-03 04:39:22 We live in a society thats wealth appears as an immense accumulation of commodities
264 2018-07-03 04:31:55 My fear is that the seasonal bounce for small caps won’t happen this year, if the Dow Jones and commodities crack to lower lows in the weeks ahead. That said, we are seeing some good activity at the small end of the market which is encouraging #ASX

272 2018-07-03 02:21:39 Singapore has simple flat 7% GST.
Some commodities and most SMEs are exempt. 
Result - Super high compliance with minimum accounting overheads.

They recently announced intent to increase this to 9% but are giving public a 3-year advance notice to prepare!
273 2018-07-03 02:20:03 Citi on BHEL

    Maintained ‘Neutral’; cut price target to Rs 75 from Rs 90.
    Rising commodities could put pressure on raw material cost.
    Management expects employee cost to rise by Rs 200-500 crore post final wage negotiation.
274 2018-07-03 02:18:59 Real Estate has a ton of risks. Chances of major loss is far far greater than US govt bonds. Crypto has an off the scale vol and tons of idiosyncratic risk. Commodities lol, not safe at all
275 2018-07-03 02:17:33 Translation: the wealthy commodities brokers I pal around with are losing money.
276 2018-07-03 02:16:58 Agree, don’t see why staple food commodities should be under GST. Affects the entire distribution channel, not to mention Customer. 
This, when we already have a highly inefficient food storage & distribution system and widespread poverty to add.
277 2018-07-03 02:13:17 The USSR paid out millions if you adhered to their lines at least on paper and if you sold them your raw commodities after independence so it got pretty deeply engrained. How this is an anti-imperialist form is a question I haven't really seen addressed.
278 2018-07-03 02:10:18 ¿Qué son los Commodities? En economía son productos básicos o materias primas provenientes de la naturaleza, como el agua, trigo o petróleo, etc..En la actualidad los productos se van comoditizando, es decir, se convierten en indispensables en la medida que se vuelven masivos

283 2018-07-03 01:18:51 Cue the doom music.

Trade wars can be a catastrophe, but such fear should be mapped to today's realities.

With freight passage secured by the US, multiple suppliers of commodities, the impact of tariffs and bilateral agreements can be quantified.

Narrative trumps reason.

286 2018-07-03 01:02:53 Just as there are different system platforms, different virtualization and storage options are no less interchangeable. If one disappears, life goes on without it.

292 2018-07-03 00:16:28 Trade Wars push up tariffs: manufacturers get squeezed; lay offs/closures happen; unemployment goes up-spending on commodities goes down-more lay-offs/closures; repeat; economy suffers; dollar weakens;austerity/cuts in public spending;gov borrowing becomes 6trillion.
