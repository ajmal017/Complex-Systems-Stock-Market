0 2018-01-22 23:59:44 That is what I meant by (from outside)....Jamie and his friends have bought heavily from 3K...and its not about greed..its about doing job for the financial elite (bring the Crypto house down)...at least that is how I read it...so no limit to downside eventually.
1 2018-01-22 23:59:39 Hey Charlie...I'm just getting into crypto and see that you're quite the man in this world.  Real happy for you!  You've done big things since our L'ville days!

3 2018-01-22 23:59:37 $TRST bottomed out and is posting higher lows. Worth checking out, a lot of room to grow. Easily pumped.
4 2018-01-22 23:59:34 centralized exchanges also have great liquidity, allowing for micro crypto trading, which targets majority of traders. You also get the coins instantly unlike with Bancor. also keep in mind as ethereum grows, the more inefficient it gets due to wait times and tx fees.

6 2018-01-22 23:59:28 no,
7 2018-01-22 23:59:27 $INT at great buying levels now... this will be the last time at these levels before rapid growth imo. I'm expecting $1USD within 3 days and from there as hype builds and possibly with new exchanges around the corner this is going to boom!

Mcafee surely has a bit of a racket going with his coin of the week. Apparently, he's been selling his calls. I was tipped off about Syscoin very early in the morning today.

15 2018-01-22 23:58:29 Its a sad day. BTC is shit but all the crypto market pays for it. I wonder when if ever will we get cryptos that are not dependent on btc price. I know with BCH they are trying to decouple it, but its just starting
