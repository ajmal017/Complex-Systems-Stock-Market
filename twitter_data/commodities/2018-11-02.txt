40 2018-11-04 22:03:03 Incorrect
The assets have to be non-consumables like gold and/or replaceables like energy commodities
An unbacked currency reserve based on future promises to provide more of the same is a ponzi scheme
41 2018-11-04 21:53:27 the 'best' part is the utter absence of humanity between the seemingly endless and glowing rows of meticulously arranged commodities.
42 2018-11-04 21:49:32 The younger userbase perhaps does see mass photos as everyday commodities with storage thereof distant and free. I've spent several years curating my Flickr Pro stream, with research and history. Maybe I've been using it wrong all this time.
43 2018-11-04 21:49:26 Oh no it’s not . Morrison is doing a whacky job of warming the seat . Our days of buying the Australian are OVER. Journalism dictated by an old greedy bitter man who thinks people are commodities to be used as he pleases.
44 2018-11-04 21:44:39 Instead let the politicians cut their own pay, make commodities cheaper let 18k have the value of 100k, I know the labour will still come back to fight again if the salary is increase today so why don't we find a lasting solution to our problems instead of this shallow approach.

46 2018-11-04 21:27:42 Changing the law here does not change the law in other countries. Competition does not always drive prices down and quality up. It does for commodities but not for skill and talent or scarce resources. Look at how salaries for CEOs and professional athletes balloon over time.
47 2018-11-04 21:16:52 i ordered mself some fancy “ self care “ commodities online and then accidentally dropped them in vomit
48 2018-11-04 21:11:53 Commodities somewhat artificially depressed but inputs not. If you're in corn/soy belt, land prices may have increased dramatically due to  buying to feed into their expanding meat production. 

Hang on a little longer. Food prices set to soar relatively soon.
49 2018-11-04 20:56:20 Is it that this nation was cursed with bad leadership? I really don't understand, labour has been too fair to negotiate 30k which is nothing compared to the prices of commodities today...
50 2018-11-04 20:39:55 commodities rise and fall all the time
51 2018-11-04 20:34:21 67)主婦たちは物価高をこぼしている。　

67)Housewives complain about high prices of commodities.
52 2018-11-04 20:13:29 No, I am not better off. Gas and other commodities have gotten really expensive, largely thanks to your tariff fetish, and conservatives keep killing people.

Thanks for asking.
53 2018-11-04 20:01:10 Not exactly. Human labour adds value to commodities. The motive of the worker is to survive. 
‘Forced equality’ is a misnomer. Capitalist society is forced inequality certainly as the state uses force to prevent the workers getting their full share of the wealth. 1/2
54 2018-11-04 19:59:45 Blefe! Eles precisam de nossas commodities da mesma forma que precisamos de seus produtos
55 2018-11-04 19:46:16 Reality check. Zimbabwe has no currency, rampant corruption, shortage of basic commodities- if available they are expensive. I can not put Lumumba, cartels , Mthuli on my table. The government of Zimbabwe should address bread and butter issues. Period.
56 2018-11-04 19:40:55 As usual people lose jobs for money we are NOT commodities
57 2018-11-04 19:36:34 I'm Going Give Him Inequitable Responses More Services For The turd & No Amount Of Monetary Gain Will Stop Me Unless I Feel That Insurance For Commodities Like Children My Family & Social Effects Are Made Now His Tactics On Using People That Are My Family Against Me Are Expensive
58 2018-11-04 19:35:03 Yh they're commodities we don't buy frequently so they need to mark them up to make profit
59 2018-11-04 19:32:24 Yes! Nós temos commodities...
60 2018-11-04 19:32:16 These kind of cases are also here in Canada as well. Virtually every major project in mining & energy has been challenged or is clogged up in the courts. Meanwhile we import commodities from jurisdictions without health, safety & enviro standards.
61 2018-11-04 19:29:43 @fkeyamo may God bless you for the beautiful job you are doing. Integrity and honesty are priceless commodities, only our hardwork and commitment can pay PMB back.
62 2018-11-04 19:21:27 Bond notes are causing serious distortion in pricing & th fact tht you continue to say they at par with US Dollar is causin our  salaries not to be raised while basic commodities ar rising prices overnight ,hw do we keep up wth tht. Remove Bond Notes
63 2018-11-04 19:15:51 Vai pra pqp China, país mais sanguessuga que este não há!
Como o Bolsonaro fala, não compram no Brasil estão comprando o Brasil.
Mil vezes uma parceria com EUA
Precisamos investir é em processo de manufatura aqui, chega de vender só commodities, precisamos de valor agregado aqui
64 2018-11-04 19:07:28 It’s just one step away from relying on royalities to pay the freight. Commodities drop off, so does our main non-residential tax base.
65 2018-11-04 19:03:58 If you own a piece of a co that own properties, plants, equipment, commodities, etc...yes.  Why do you think equities rise in hyperinflation if they are not real?
66 2018-11-04 18:49:58 Stocks, commodities, currencies, crypto... It's all the same guys. The only difference is some shit is the flavor of the day and some shit is out of favor... Then the Masters rotate out of one and into another

70 2018-11-04 18:34:05 If we talking commodities $VGZ has great projects going on. Gold really needs to rally. We’ll see what happens this week.
71 2018-11-04 18:28:01 You’ve got to be kidding. One year in and induced shortages of all basic commodities, petrol queues, limits on how many and what you can buy, crazy inflation and my dr demands forex. This is progress? PS Where is Itai Dzamara?
72 2018-11-04 18:23:49 If you’re talking about the slave trade then there was a profit incentive behind taking people from Africa and forcing them into 20 hour working days. They were used as capital to create other commodities and they were bought and sold on the market. Typical capitalism.
73 2018-11-04 18:18:36 Quem precisa de commodities é a China, não nós. Não precisamos de muambas vindas de lá que ferraram com a nossa indústria, não! Quer comprar do Brasil? Compre. Comprar o Brasil, jamais!
74 2018-11-04 18:15:20 This is awful, awful, awful. How can anyone think it is right. Animals are not commodities.
75 2018-11-04 17:58:01 Careful what you wish for: buying up several trillion of commodities, on the open market, means dramatically driving up pretty much all commodity prices (inflation...) as big-money speculators move in

At some point the bubble bursts, and reserve values take the hit.
76 2018-11-04 17:52:46 Até na lógica americana é complicado, pq os americanos subsidiam produção agrícola em larga escala e em cinturões regionais. Há controle de produção de commodities pro mercado externo e interno.
77 2018-11-04 17:41:51 Yeah.. that's prolly true. I didn't put much thought into him staying West.. but that's probably true. Still.. USU and Fresno are prolly gonna need some new coordinators. USU's OC & Fresno's DC are both gonna be hot commodities.
78 2018-11-04 17:37:31 Es un sistema y los periodistas jóvenes se forman mal. Las empresas confunden periodismo digital con hacer "noticias commodities", que es laburo de las agencias de noticias, que a su vez van cerrando.
79 2018-11-04 17:29:46 Access is but one element of an effective innovation system. Canada spends too much time and money expecting gov't to expedite innovation. We are JUST shedding our dependence on raw carbon commodities. The innovation ecosystem lacks technology networks, undeveloped relationships.
80 2018-11-04 17:28:39 Because like all animals they are treated as commodities or widgets instead of living beings. It enrages me seeing them in 8-oz containers languishing. Evil!
81 2018-11-04 17:25:36 Political prisoners are not commodities. Just saying.

82 2018-11-04 17:21:45 2/ by higher info diffusion rate, I'm suggesting the "world is flat" phenomenon, real time news, twitter, etc...; influences to commodities are more widespread. New information  disseminates faster, impacts harder. And only a mild shift in the right tail disturbs the balance.
83 2018-11-04 17:19:44 Iwe taura solutions to the on-going basic commodities crisis not this hogwash you spill everyday
84 2018-11-04 17:16:44 We went there to market her 'essential commodities'
85 2018-11-04 17:01:10 Absolutely appalling. Yet again, animals are treated like commodities that are disposable. This is a shameful way to treat these loyal, brave dogs. I bet their handlers are horrified as well.
86 2018-11-04 16:57:07 O Brasil é exportador de commodities agrícolas. Os EUA e a Europa também. Além de indústria, possuem agricultura forte. Os principais importadores mundiais de alimento são os países árabes e a China.
87 2018-11-04 16:55:39 It’s illegal in commodities markets too and it seems likely the CFTC will continue to treat BTC as a commodity

89 2018-11-04 16:42:18 Realmente, o futebol, como quase todo “negócio” no Brasil, resolveu que “commodities” tá de bom tamanho, então, os times estão se lixando para qualquer tipo de qualidade local!
90 2018-11-04 16:33:48 Does anyone you love have asthma COPD heart troubles? Laws were put in place to protect irreplaceable commodities... AIR & WATER!

Lula surfou na altas das commodities, aplicou MAL o dinheiro, fez escolhas erradas, deu milhões de bandeja para ditaduras. Poderíamos estar em uma situação muito melhor
97 2018-11-04 16:08:14 As hardware gets closer to being “commodities” prices are coming down. When it becomes less expensive to replace all your devices then what happens to Apple, again. Another loan from Microsoft.
98 2018-11-04 16:08:06 Our population will hit 70M by 2030, we will need more food ,anyone telling us to  stop growing maize, Wheat etc ,because they are not profitable is missing the point. They should instead wipe out the cartels who  hurt farmers by importing cheap condemned commodities. Tai ..
99 2018-11-04 16:03:49 One caveat: the futures game is one of users of commodities wanting to layoff risks to speculators and those users of commodities ARE WILLING LOSERS in order to defray some risk.  This makes futures a nuanced zero-sum game ie one where there is a economic logic for willing loser
100 2018-11-04 15:57:57 so you are arguing for gold and commodities both in a portfolio?
101 2018-11-04 15:53:02 hey, watch ur words, don't say something u don't know OK? Rookie come to LPL as a giveaway of Kakao's transferring.

104 2018-11-04 15:34:23 A question to pose is how long does it take for a tree to grow to that level? We are talking a decade which means that track has been abandoned for years. Most likely used by goods trains and the commodities they transport are gone or Factory closed. Surely rebuilding is needed
105 2018-11-04 15:33:18 # 1(Iqrar) only. The rest are variable commodities.
106 2018-11-04 15:25:46 By opposing Trump and Republicans, Buffet revealed himself to be a true patriot. Also, I wasn’t aware his records and CD’s are hot commodities in Russia.
107 2018-11-04 15:20:21 Essa logica de que é sempre bom ter uma moeda valorizada traz riscos imensos. Somos um país baseado em economia de serviços e indústria de commodities. Qualquer economista meia boca sabe que isso é contra qualquer teoria do desenvolvimento econômico
108 2018-11-04 15:13:00 Sorry, however I’m discussing $BTC and commodities here, not ICO’s and crypto.
109 2018-11-04 15:10:02 There is no alpha in CTA trading any longer, in the best case it is smart beta., IMO still a fair hedge in case of equity plunge but reduced effect due to financialization of commodities.

115 2018-11-04 14:48:08 People buy mining Hardware in order to compete for bitcoin. When a miner solves a block, they are awarded Bitcoin for helping secure the decentralized network. Price is determined by supply and demand on an open market, much like gold, silver, and other commodities.

121 2018-11-04 14:18:56 Creation of $BTC gives us the ability to trust eachother again, instead of lying the trust in to a third-party (in this case institutions/banks).

So yes, during the next crisis the demand for $BTC and commodities will increase, as the trust in the regular system decreases.
122 2018-11-04 14:18:12 It's funny to seeing words like 'genocide' and 'phobes' are trending often against people who reflect something that ain't match our interest. In fact they kinda becoming a fashionable commodities to shaming and censoring others. #EreeWedia

126 2018-11-04 14:00:10 US grain sorghum is subject to the 25% tariff just like other commodities.  There is still a small amount being sold into China, but not the large volume of the past several years.

It's maybe worth pointing one of North America's greatest family farm advocates to your inspiring charity work.

129 2018-11-04 13:41:29 Lots of legal issues to resolve before cannabis can be traded internationally like other commodities
130 2018-11-04 13:23:36 I don't think this is a market crash. We as trader know to protect downside always rather upside. Instead of trading for a small profit in Option Selling with high risk, it would be better to trade in commodities base metals with less risk & investment and more consistent profit

142 2018-11-04 12:02:01 @sureshpprabhu Sir, ports have to keep applying to DGFT for permissions to handle various types of commodities. Leaving aside the most hazardous such as explosives and radioactive cargoes, it should be possible to import and export all commodities from all the Indian ports.

As much as any public school educated, ex-City Boy commodities-trading, mouth for hire can be.
167 2018-11-04 07:27:59 According to the regulatory filing, a further $3.1 million will be paid over three years and, depending on the performance of the business over this time frame, an extra $10.9 million will also be paid to the commodities broker.
168 2018-11-04 07:25:52 I buy from any of the major retail shops, have never walked out without any of the basic commodities that I need from day to day. So I sit here and wonder; what is this panic all about?

172 2018-11-04 06:56:43 Oh, and not only his family, but other cabinet members who used tax payer money to go on shopping sprees and buy illustrious pen sets, for example.
173 2018-11-04 06:55:37 How much in tax payer dollars has our "Great Leader" and his family wasted on frivolous things since he's been in office? Right now the total estimate sits at around 4.7 million dollars. Nowhere near the amount that some poor immigrants who work jobs nobody wants would accrue.
174 2018-11-04 06:45:00 Win or lose, everybody gets what they want out of the market. Some people seem to like to lose, so they win by losing money.

176 2018-11-04 06:20:31 That's all nonsense...busy focussing on these silly issues while the country is on its knees.. we don't hear you talking about prices of basic commodities and shortages. Makutaura zvinhu zvisingatipe food on the table yet you claim to represent people
177 2018-11-04 06:08:00 It is clearly an exaggeration and deceptive  to say that minimum wage employees take home "huge" when, in fact, their modest take home pay is quickly eaten up by much higher commodities triggered by the TRAIN Law. Franchises like Jollibee, etc. even increased at least 3x so far.
178 2018-11-04 06:07:42 If women are considered as commodities, it's a scandal!

Humans and sex have become commodities especially since the so-called "sexual revolution"
182 2018-11-04 05:48:49 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
183 2018-11-04 05:17:56 As I always ask: Why does no one turn down a government check paid in non-interest bearing tokens :)  Bonds are silly. 
As Mosler and Forstater wrote, tax-credits can be analyzed like a commodity, and commodities dont earn interest.
184 2018-11-04 05:14:30 Definitely. Question is, will it hike in line with forecasts, or less? Will inflation be in line with expectations, or lower? If lower one wants to invest in bonds, if in line one wants to replace bonds with inflation linked bonds and commodities.

192 2018-11-04 04:03:02 It still doesn't solve the fundamental problem that we are importing everything even basic commodities. The answer lies in improving our country's productive capacity. We should be able to produce what we need locally.

199 2018-11-04 02:47:36 It's commodities. When you have a lot its cheap, when its cheap no one wants to pour money into drilling new wells (its very fucking high tech and expensive to drill offshore especially) when they don't drill new wells they start to run out and prices go up.
200 2018-11-04 02:41:15 Drugs makes you addicted to commodities produced by capitalists and thus dependent on the continuance of capitalism.
201 2018-11-04 02:39:44 Barter trade have been going on for too long. It's no longer exchange of goods. That's why barter is no longer the right word. Rice, corn and fuel are the common commodities coming from Sabah going to Tawi Tawi, Basilan and Zamboanga. EO reviving barter is therefore a joke
202 2018-11-04 02:36:17 Burke Thomas Kanter & Lee are "tradable commodities"....increase CAP ..open roster slots.
203 2018-11-04 02:28:35 Back of envelope calculation. I make no claim to accuracy. Commodities are known to maintain ratios of prices by balancing of supply and demand over time.
204 2018-11-04 02:22:39 1998 a short term slump when China's currency tanked in 98 and they couldn't take their usual share. oil hit $8, so did pork bellies. All commodities were hurt and it effected commodity based countries like Australia and Russia more than us. We were still in dotcom boom
205 2018-11-04 02:14:23 Really...  Hmmm. I didn’t realize it. I will have to put crude up against the USD 5 year chart. I know usually a strong dollar hurts commodities

210 2018-11-04 01:54:03 It all seems pedantic. If you have a coinage or credit that a community accepts for transactions then isn’t it inherently money. I get that the development timeline may be with credit leading but it doesn’t change the fact that millions of people have used commodities to transact

248 2018-11-03 23:01:57 Lee historia Ariel... déficit tenemos desde 1910 (y antes) y tiene que ver con nuestra matriz productiva. No tuvimos déficit en el 45' por el superavit de la WWII y desde el 03' hasta el 07' por los precios de los commodities.
249 2018-11-03 22:54:50 Export rights of commodities: Australia alone can feed dairy products to the world alone.Let's make all countries specialized in something and world should be relied upon them.
250 2018-11-03 22:51:35 Export rights of commodities:Australia,USA,India & Canada are the countries should be given a job to feed this world in terms of wheat food grains such as lentils & dairy products.And similarly other countries are to be specialized in some other fields.....
251 2018-11-03 22:47:56 Due to my career change, I'm looking into expanding my network to passionate commodities sales agents. Find me on linked in.
252 2018-11-03 22:40:36 These types say that women are treated as commodities, then willingly  proceed to market themselves as usable sex objects.  Quite ironic.
253 2018-11-03 22:27:54 She wanted to have no trade deals, no commodities, no medicines and no food. Just so she can say we are GREAT BRITAIN.... 
254 2018-11-03 22:02:55 The point was bonds ignored weak ISM and commodities and yields closed higher.
255 2018-11-03 22:01:15 Donating it left over embryos is better than destroying them. But those children are still being treated as commodities and will likely deeply mourn their lost relationship w bio mom and dad, possibly wonder why their parents kept their siblings but not them.
256 2018-11-03 21:54:13 As tragic as the mother’s infertility is it doesn’t justify treating humans at any life stage as commodities - it’s a form of slavery, before birth!

259 2018-11-03 21:18:45 In Capitalism , technological innovation is inverse related to product quality. Technology is used for the mass production of low quality commodities. #economics #marxism
260 2018-11-03 21:16:35 You shouldn't tell us about this,it is irrelevant,how are we going to make the prices of commodities come down?
261 2018-11-03 21:05:12 At least he’d still have his supply of bull shit from his local purveyor of such commodities.
262 2018-11-03 21:01:35 An opinion is under no law. This is not a court, we are not judge or jury. Just people discussing on a platform. If you don't care about my opinion, don't answer to it.
263 2018-11-03 20:58:20 They are contributing, which is a good thing. But not making their country better.
264 2018-11-03 20:58:00 The EOSex trading platform gives users access to leveraged transactions of the world's major stocks, core stock indices, commodities (eg crude oil, gold, etc.), Bitcoin, Ethereum and other asset classes that attract capital flows.    #EOSex #ICO #EOS #EOSEXCHANGE
265 2018-11-03 20:57:30 I want to know from him since I was talking to him, but if you insist, please share your thoughts. I'd be happy to discuss it with you.
266 2018-11-03 20:56:03 This has nothing to do with merit. He could clean the shit from a hotel's toilets for all I care, he has to contribute to the society, but you don't have to bring merit. How many Americans deserve their citizenship then? Who does merit it?
267 2018-11-03 20:50:49 I don't have one, but it would be a nice idea if I had one. People applying for papers need a place to stay, don't they? Hopefully, there are some places funded just to do that.
268 2018-11-03 20:50:16 There's nothing revolutionary about doing drugs, they make you addicted to capitalist commodities.
269 2018-11-03 20:47:53 So you bring nothing new, I guess. Maybe you should not be allowed in the US. Refugees want to work and contribute to the society, so do immigrants. Some of them are lazy bumps so are some American citizens. Don't put them all in the same bag.
270 2018-11-03 20:47:37  unbelievable!
I sold the farm buildings of my parents! There was 2 plots of land on the rear of the farm! 70 km on the east of LILLE and all the commodities
1 for 58k€ around 80 AUD
1 for 44k€ around 65 AUD
Both have 1000m2
On the fringue of LILLE 2 or 3 time more!
271 2018-11-03 20:43:15 Nicely said Ms. Yates, andhank you for your courageous service to your country. You served with integrity, honesty and honour...rare commodities these days!
272 2018-11-03 20:37:58 Appreciate the help man. I'm on a cold streak the last month. Thinking of getting out of crypto for now and back into commodities
273 2018-11-03 20:21:20 No these EDiots varikutipa nhamo,they are not supposed to kip on defending thieves whilst vanhu takutotadza kutenga some basic commodities
274 2018-11-03 20:12:02 Despite the escalating demand for metals, supply is taking off in the same time - miners explore new projects, refiners expand capacity. So, what does global electrification drive mean for commodities markets?
275 2018-11-03 20:08:58 Don't boycott the election. Commodities are boycotted. Voting is a right. Rights are relinquished or foregone.
276 2018-11-03 20:06:16 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
277 2018-11-03 19:54:37 Tendo em vista q hoje há maior valor agregado e em volume de data em superação até mesmo a commodities, o Brasil entra na hyper historia com pequenos novos grupos sociais q usam geração e transmissão de dados para plena criação de uma nova prática de discurso.
278 2018-11-03 19:51:27 Bicho, não existe cenário cambial possível onde o Brasil seja capaz de pressionar a China. A China pode muito bem buscar alternativas para os nosso commodities como a soja argentina, enquanto os manufaturados que consumimos não tem equivalente.
279 2018-11-03 19:50:03 Long gold/commodities? Short equities/bonds? Not sure - seeing some flavor like this. I may be wrong.
280 2018-11-03 19:46:59 * oil: 6%, several countries waivers on sanctions on Tehran, export Iranian crude... Benchmark crude oil: 20 cents a barrel, $72.69 by0910 GMT... commodities: fallen 2%, at beginning of October... US light crude was 25 cents, Below $63.44, down 13%,
281 2018-11-03 19:43:11 what? you couldn't possibly be talking about the #KangarooNationalistCourt of USA Inc. ... could you? we aren't a government... we are a business... and the 99%=commodities. THEY OWN US, remember the ILLEGAL RIGGING of the DNC primary? nobody did anything then, either ...
282 2018-11-03 19:30:46 Arguments for a big rally in commodities coming.
283 2018-11-03 19:22:18 Here's the problem with this and other poverty tactics.

1. It costs to make those wrappers. Resources that should have been spent creating those commodities now go into making those sachets.

2. Pollution. Need I say more?
284 2018-11-03 19:10:51 Or I should say Commodities Traders
285 2018-11-03 18:49:47 They’re hot commodities!
286 2018-11-03 18:34:25 Funny how some crypto heads think. Not all fiats will lose in any crisis. Maybe equities, fixed income and commodities. Some fiat will win. Maybe not chinese yuan !
287 2018-11-03 18:26:11 And glitter. You are right, they will be the next commodities to be aware of, along with helium.
288 2018-11-03 18:20:15 What the prices of commodities ,rent and other consumables before this government came? There is and Edo proverb that says if you cannot improve me  leave me in my  present state.This regime has wreck everything good in this country
289 2018-11-03 18:18:50 Nos vendemos commodities... se fossem produtos industrializados, ai sim poderiamos ser substituidos... diz ai dr sabichão quem vai substituir em quantidade, qualidade e preço?
290 2018-11-03 18:13:57 U must hv taken lot of dollars for this stand.. the sellable commodities like u make nations disgraceful.
291 2018-11-03 18:08:31 Unbelievable! Punishing poor families because they fall into arrears paying for school meals. What kind of a government turns kids into commodities and stigmatises ppl struggling to make ends meet? #ToriesOut
292 2018-11-03 17:43:13 Just having a look at China and Commodities recently

294 2018-11-03 17:30:16 We may be- the overwhelmingly negative consensus ignores the fact that prices have already collapsed in short space of time in a relatively balanced market made tighter by Iranian sanctions -commodities do not trade to zero because there is an extra barrel of supply
295 2018-11-03 17:18:37 Oil downturn is four years #OOTT I knew commodities cycles were long but this is too long
296 2018-11-03 17:14:59 Eles precisam mais do Brasil do que o Brasil precisa deles. Onde mais os árabes vão comprar commodities com aquele preço camarada que só o presidiário poderia oferecer aos seus amiguinhos? Chega de mamata. Ao sairmos do clube dos países fracassados, negociaremos com o mundo todo.
297 2018-11-03 17:14:21 It has to be. Love is basically made up of time and attention, life’s most precious of commodities, and they deliver both of these to you in abundance. 
298 2018-11-03 17:13:08 A China está produzindo soja no Irã sendo que a China já comprou praticamente o continente africano para produzir commodities agrícolas minérios  e sua força de trabalho ... Para que , seria para alimentar 1 bilhão e 400 milhões de chineses ou por ganância ?
299 2018-11-03 17:03:06 Mais cíclico. Mas não é claro isto. E função do preço de Commodities. Além do valor da Terra que tá marcada a custo. Enfim, não é a SLC, é uma empresa de varejo diviersificado sem dar muita satisfação para os acionistas. Este é meu ponto. Mas não são maus gestores.
300 2018-11-03 16:54:37 honestly people who put such a focus on hard labor and production of commodities totally disregard pretty much the most important tenant of LTV and it’s fucking ridiculous
301 2018-11-03 16:40:22 You are SO right! As long as animals are seen as commodities, instead of as individuals, abuse is inevitable.
302 2018-11-03 16:39:45 Tenho Gerdau. Mas aço normalmente é no final do ciclo. Aço não é produtor raiz de commodities, é spread entre commodities: matérias primas como minério de ferro, carvão e refratários, pra produzir aço.
303 2018-11-03 16:39:15 Disparity for whom? Big Strawberry?

We have harvesters for most ag commodities, so it’s strange to object now. Also seems similar to the argument for removing minimum wage, saying that more ppl could work. Farmers have the right to employ any legal method to harvest their crop.
304 2018-11-03 16:23:16 Althusser always triggering the nerds: "He indicated a general willingness to accept that all Marx’s value theory might be wrong, to be abandoned. Besides, he remarked, Marx constructed Capital in a completely mistaken way, by starting with commodities in Chapter One."
305 2018-11-03 16:22:16 So poorer become poorest, petrol 85 rs/l , Rasoie gas 1200 rs aur price of essential commodities touching to sky. ADANI AMBANI ADANI BABA RAM DEV  become richest.
306 2018-11-03 16:11:38 @CC_Rosenthal another economic technology of slavery: price lists replicates norms established in eg. grain commodities. Grades of quality and height (unlike age, height was measurable at the point of sale.) #hss18
307 2018-11-03 16:09:19 As a factory worker I would like to personally thank him for driving the cost of gas and commodities up as well as removing state itemizations causing my taxes to go up
308 2018-11-03 16:08:52 #DrKasan, DG Treda MOT, explains that @Kemendag has simplified the import process of more than 3000 commodities by shifting the import procedure of restricted commodities from border to post border. #IndonesiaBriefing #IndonesiaUpdate @Kemlu_RI @AtdagLondon
309 2018-11-03 15:48:21 #xrp is a currency or commodity (it's certaintly NOT a security) but in either case "market cap" has no meaning. Commodities do not have market caps: There's a limited supply and price is driven by demand. XRP is being adopted and demand will soar. Market cap means nothing.

700 million unbanked farmers in #Africa the likes of #BLCC block commodities pending RTO Canada
311 2018-11-03 15:32:16 #BLCC block commodities are the only company in the world to br putting the #blockchain into at pilot scheme in #Uganda.

312 2018-11-03 15:29:33 What if I told you that Bitcoin and cryptodollarization in general is the counter-weight for USD hegemony that is needed to offset the One Belt, One Road, People's Blockchain of China with increasing pricing power over key commodities (gold, oil, ag).
313 2018-11-03 15:27:12 Mr. Schnell, do you plan on adding Commodities Countdown to YouTube?
314 2018-11-03 15:27:06 Yep. Long made the most important point of all. Gruden essentially taking two steps back to take one forward. Giving up known commodities for question marks. Every draft choice IS a question mark.
315 2018-11-03 15:21:24 4)"Soros said that there was a flight from currencies across the board, and that this is why the price of commodities, notably gold and oil, were generally rising. He also stated that an orderly decline of the dollar was “desirable” .....~Beyondthecurtain

318 2018-11-03 15:10:01 Are sanctions looting diamonds?
Are sanctions causing shortages of basic commodities?
Are sanctions causing shortages of foreign currency?
Are sanctions causing the black market?
Are sanctions looting state funds?

People need to be responsible for their actions, period
319 2018-11-03 15:09:44 Commodities Corner: Why oil prices are plunging despite U.S. sanctions on Iran’s energy sector The oil market has had nearly six months to assess the possible effect of U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports. Surprisingly, the prospect of significantly tighter global supplies…
320 2018-11-03 15:05:20 E os expertos acham que o mundo está a nossos pés pq exportamos commodities e que não tem concorrência 
321 2018-11-03 15:02:22 Só "commodities". Colônia  rs
322 2018-11-03 14:41:15 Crescimento global e aumento do preço de commodities dependem do motor do mundo: Estados Unidos. Eles puxam produtos do mundo, puxam a China, q é uma máquina consumidora de commodities.

EUA puxam o mundo e nós dependemos indiretamente (às vezes diretamente) dos americanos.
323 2018-11-03 14:32:58 A atual é a troca de mercadorias industrializadas. Países emergentes/periféricos vendem produtos de baixo valor agregado (commodities/aço/ferro) para os países desenvolvidos/centrais, que transformam em produtos de alto valor agregado e vendem de volta mais caro. #euvoudeproenem
324 2018-11-03 14:16:00 Se os combustiveis são commodities, a obrigatoriedade da mistura com alcool nos leva a uma armadilha. Pois a gasolina pode almentar por conta do preço do alcool e vice-versa . O que muito agrada aos Governo (IMPOSTOS) e, claro, aos atravessadores..O resultado em cascata é ruim
325 2018-11-03 14:14:48 Hi Sean, I find it interesting that all three commodities are doing so well but UEC is in the tank. Look at U3O8, V2O5, and TiO2 where all are on the rise or have done extremely well in the last 2 years but UEC is a cellar dweller.  Not a big deal but change is overdue at the top
326 2018-11-03 14:02:26 Concordo bem com a análise, com exceção à causalidade que você botou. O juro americano e bolsas EM sobem e caem juntos devido a outros motivos, como crescimento global, commodities, etc... O mesmo vale com a relação CPI (cheio) e EMs. Ambos são índices long commodities e growth
327 2018-11-03 13:59:36 80% is the magic number.  Techs bottomed down 80% Commodities bottomed down 80%  Biotechs bottomed down 80%.........sx7e was just down 80% from the peak
328 2018-11-03 13:52:22 Mas é óbvio, o Brasil exporta commodities (só o q tem de competitivo) e importa produtos de tecnologia! Quer o q?

330 2018-11-03 13:18:26 I don’t expect much other than bluffing with the prices of milk, or other commodities.
331 2018-11-03 13:17:11 And you sell cooking Gas @ ₹1000/-. Athavale was honest to admit that the increase in prices of essential commodities does not impact him since he is a minister. I am at loss to understand who should be ashamed ? People who elected or.......
332 2018-11-03 13:13:27 Very true, however, I have different rules for commodities and FX
333 2018-11-03 13:09:36 Vão desacostumar, e a China que grita muito, mas faz 3 anos que promete bilhões de investimentos aqui até 2020 e não investiu nada até agora também terá que se acostumar com vendermos commodities pra outros e nos industrializarmos. @onyxlorenzoni @jairbolsonaro
334 2018-11-03 13:01:30 Yeah, I was specifically referring to utilising multiple clouds as commodities while focusing on portability. Especially K8S is quite often positioned as a means to seamlessly migrate container workloads across (public) clouds. Who is actually doing that? Excl. on-prem to public
335 2018-11-03 13:01:07 The things tat MR had done after he was made as PM in a #CoupLK , reduced price of essential commodities, #FuelPriceCut, a TNA MP switched camp to MR, NR has visited the localities with the respective MPs, #Gotabaya met with Ranil, Plantation workers wage revision press release.

337 2018-11-03 12:55:16 A china representa hoje o maior parceiro comercial do Brasil, é inviável deixar essa parceria de lado, o Brasil tem grande potencial na exportação de Commodities e há tempos essa questão foi negligenciada pelos governos anteriores. Usar isso estrategicamente é a melhor opção
338 2018-11-03 12:50:39 "we have & will maintain many humanitarian exemptions to our sanctions including food, agriculture commodities, medicine & medical devices." @SecPompeo. Please stop this misinformation campaign Mr.Dehghan.
339 2018-11-03 12:46:35 Bd Josivan! Além da pecuária de corte. Quais outros setores(commodities) serão atingidos em Rondônia? 
340 2018-11-03 12:43:10 what platform are you using to trade commodities. it's a good choice.
341 2018-11-03 12:34:42 Interessante que todo analista aqui no Brasil diz que se juro subir lá, nós seremos afetados fortemente de forma e negativa e aí incluindo bolsa. Essa sua interpretação é diferente, no caso pouco importa o juro, mas o crescimento se manter e faz sentido, growth = commodities
342 2018-11-03 12:12:18 Agree, but being from another country, I was pointing out that legally his opinion does not have merit.
343 2018-11-03 12:10:43 Gavilon Group LLC has suspended proprietary trading of agricultural commodities as grain and oilseed prices remain low amid the trade war between the U.S. and China. 

@business @isiscarol14
344 2018-11-03 12:07:43 This President thing is just an outing for you ? A meet and greet for five years ? Where are the basic commodities for the people ?
345 2018-11-03 12:06:33 
Thanks for the chuckle!
346 2018-11-03 12:05:04 3202: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
347 2018-11-03 12:04:17 67)主婦たちは物価高をこぼしている。　

67)Housewives complain about high prices of commodities.
348 2018-11-03 12:02:44 Not crying. Laughing. At you, bee-tee-dubs. And definitely not with you.
349 2018-11-03 12:01:12 None. Wow. That was the easiest quiz I’ve ever taken! But, you didn’t answer my question: When did spelling become a “politically correct” issue to you? Before or after the Trump moron took over the White House?
350 2018-11-03 11:58:54 like you would ever deviate from your MSM overlords.
351 2018-11-03 11:57:29 Also, when did spelling become politically correct? Is that the new right wing conspiracy theory? Man, I got to check out Breitbart today and see what’s going on over in bat-shit crazy land.
352 2018-11-03 11:55:47 Modi govt itself is corrupt,  rise in price of  all commodities and petrol etc..., unemployment. Who is responsible for all this ?
353 2018-11-03 11:55:32 peak tribalism. you seem to have a bloated superiority complex.  if you only wish to spit out ad hominems then you are a waste of everyones time.
354 2018-11-03 11:54:34 Clearly you don’t care about spelling because you have one in this tweet. Keep celebrating your dumbness. And when you decide to send out the pipe bombs to support your racist, wack-job of a president, make sure & include ‘em so we can catch you, too.
355 2018-11-03 11:51:39 a truly heroic and brave move on your part.
356 2018-11-03 11:50:49 it's almost like English isn't my first langue and mistakes happens, especially on a site where an option to edit your text is available. the way you cry over bad spelling shows you don't have many foreign friends.
357 2018-11-03 11:48:23 Thanks! You do the same.
358 2018-11-03 11:48:00 As plentiful as they are inevitable. Have a lovely Saturday!
359 2018-11-03 11:46:53 Hahahaha. I muted the fool. Their self-owns are plentiful.
360 2018-11-03 11:45:13 It’s *your. Jeez. Is this you trying?
361 2018-11-03 11:43:27 I wonder if he’s one of those sad loners who lives in his mom’s basement, playing video games all day & throwing out silly little 4Chan insults like NPC all the time? Magic 8 Ball says, “Very Likely.”
362 2018-11-03 11:42:46 "poor racist". you inaccurate perception of my opinions is beyond worthless to me.
363 2018-11-03 11:42:22 as if that is a widespread problem and not few isolated cases. 
and i don't care how asinine you see certain claims to be, if you have half a brain cell, you should be able to bring actual arguments instead of mockery.
364 2018-11-03 11:36:25 Spot on. Kills me when someone comes out to defend these troglodytes. According to trump they’re the”super elites.” 
365 2018-11-03 11:34:54 Pretty much anyone who does not still support Trump has superiority. He’s ruined the Republican Party. You guys no longer have any moral ground to stand on. But, please, go back to talking about bombing children. B/C apparently criticizing someone’s grammar is offensive to you.
366 2018-11-03 11:34:47 Some of it, like the unreal beauty standards are too much, antithetical to peace of mind and happiness itself. Promoting useless stuff is happening because of overproducing commodities, which is in turn because of overlooking genuine insights in the market.
367 2018-11-03 11:33:53 You know how people relate to eachother through commodities like "my favourite super hero" or "which dwarf are you in the Hobbit?" If you listen to @ProlesPod and read some history you can start relating to your friends like this instead "goddamn I feel like Leo Jogiches rn".
368 2018-11-03 11:33:16 they should bring service through the current system of the country just like everyone else. having higher standards than that is highly unreasonable. illegal immigrants are working outside the system and can not be tolerated as they threaten the stability of your country.
369 2018-11-03 11:33:14 I’m sorry... Who brought syphilis-laden blankets to the western continent?
370 2018-11-03 11:33:01 Rachel
In some predominantly Muslim majority countries some women are treated like commodities
Yes there are honour killings. Where young women are killed usually by their male family members as a f@ucked up way 2restored some ridiculous reputation to the family name
371 2018-11-03 11:30:50 What’s a light bulk? Do you buy it at Costco?

373 2018-11-03 11:30:04 so mocking the poorly educated is perfectly fine according to you. it's good to see where you stand. but please continue to morally grandstand like you have any moral superiority.

375 2018-11-03 11:25:41 “then” not “than.”  When complaining about others, proper etiquette dictates correct use of language.
376 2018-11-03 11:25:40 Anyone that has a job and pays taxes is making their country better.
377 2018-11-03 11:22:40 Spot on. Unfortunately, that seems to be the majority of Trump’s base. I mean, poor grammar usage/ bad spelling is one of the ways they caught the wack-job, Trump-supporting bomber. They love him because he’s as stupid as they are.

378 2018-11-03 11:22:17 My company does biz in OH. We supply mfrs with commodities. 2016 was our worst year ever. Sales were $100 million lower in 2016 than 2014. Then @realDonaldTrump won. 2017 was an uptick but now 2018 is going to be our BEST YEAR EVER.

379 2018-11-03 11:22:04 You know, for all the talk from SWERFs about how the sex industry is abusive and exploitative and treats women as commodities, I still haven't heard a single one call for the abolishment of the fashion industry or making modelling illegal to "rescue" the models.
380 2018-11-03 11:19:28 So many native americans  killed by this "migrants"...Obviously you don't mention it.
381 2018-11-03 11:17:59 that's the thing you don't need to worry about when you are born into a country. you only need to give your service. if he were to move country, they have the right to ask what merit he is bringing.

387 2018-11-03 11:13:09 Great everything is great except that it’s was a PepsiCo container. Should have tried some essential commodities as symbol !!
388 2018-11-03 11:12:17 They have enough riches to go for years, the only problem are these mullahs and people who are controlling the country as we speak, billions of dollars just vanish yearly
389 2018-11-03 10:57:22 I've said it before and I'll say it again -

Democrat or Republican, we are nothing to them but commodities to be bought and sold.
390 2018-11-03 10:56:25 I would like to know what technology do YOU bring to help the US? How did you make your country better than it was?
391 2018-11-03 10:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
392 2018-11-03 09:40:43 Ghana is implementing a Commodities Exchange next week that hopefully addresses most of the challenges farmers face with product storage, fair pricing and marketing
393 2018-11-03 09:00:09 About as little as consumers have had in keeping any industry (fashion, food) accountable through boycotts or whatever. It's capitalism. Football is a product; players are commodities; teams corporations. The engine of the so-called free market grinds away

396 2018-11-03 08:26:56 If there is an irrational  hike in cost of commodities it would reflect on ground but it doesn't,  so what's the inference?  Irrational doubters?
397 2018-11-03 08:18:36 Buying essential commodities
398 2018-11-03 08:04:52 Actually, I think it is much deeper than that. I think that in too many ways, ‘Republicans’ have a much deeper and inappropriate morality. It far too often reflects a selfish and self-serving manner of looking at people as virtual commodities.
399 2018-11-03 07:50:54 I know times are hard but some shopkeepers exxagerate the prices of their commodities way too high. Like, dont be dishonest all in the name of making a profit smh.

403 2018-11-03 06:48:18 Just don't ask if they want any clothes pegs or tea towels. Don't ask if their parents are home or if they've discovered the true path over the rainbow bridge.

409 2018-11-03 06:25:20 Great interview I really enjoyed his take on economics. Not sure why he says commodities can’t be money though they have for the majority of human history!
410 2018-11-03 06:21:30 The logic here is that """not producing value""" *is* doing something wrong because we are all just fungible commodities defined by the "value" we "produce."

412 2018-11-03 06:16:18 The Nigerian NLC have missed the point. They should clamour for control in prizes of essential commodities and force the Government to raise the purchasing power of Naira instead of increase in salaries which will breed more inflation and worsen the economic condition of Nigeria

420 2018-11-03 04:26:31 1.Sure so worker's ownership of the means of production would mean the 'things' (Factories) that produce commodities would be owned collectively. I'm not a socialist personally, but one way of doing this is creating a worker's co-operative where decisions are made democratically
421 2018-11-03 03:55:07 4. Crescimento nos EUA diminuem afetando China. Motor da economia mundial perde tração. Commodities começam a cair. Fim da onda.

425 2018-11-03 02:40:12 no one would have to because in an actually socialist society there would be no commodity exchange and therefore no currency. ignoring that, why would a so called leftist be for the commodification of women’s bodies in a society without commodities?
426 2018-11-03 02:38:42 No. I'm platform agnostic. I don't care if its Crypto, FX, commodities, Property, bananas or bottle-tops.   I just don't like #fraud.
427 2018-11-03 02:38:36 I didn't get a tax cut, and in fact will be paying more when those temporary cuts expire. My wages didn't increase because of President Trump, but because my union fought for teacher raises. Commodities are MORE expensive, thanks to those tariffs. So you must be rich or deluded.
428 2018-11-03 02:08:31 False advertising by Heitkamp on soybeans? No, I can tell you the tariffs are killing us and any future trade with China. They’re decreasing soy % in rations to not need our commodities.
429 2018-11-03 02:03:31 In support of other members of the republican party. He is doing the rallies to boost support for republican congressmen and senate commodities, to help them get elected in this bi-election.
430 2018-11-03 02:01:34 Perth offers better value than other parts of the country and with a commodities boom starting it’ll fare better than most other cities in a downturn. I’m not bullish on property though, it’s had a 30yr upward cycle, now the downturn will go through 2020-2030 IMO. Very bearish.
431 2018-11-03 01:41:36 treating  women  as  commodities  is  valid
432 2018-11-03 01:41:16 Yeah... On the other hand, the supply chains for most commodities are really ugly. No ethical consumption under capitalism, my dude.
433 2018-11-03 01:37:59 Then have commodities, rent and such lowered. Cut the housing values and such. It’s impossible to rent a one bedroom place with 7.50 an hour

439 2018-11-03 00:47:29 I'm looking at buying in Perth early next year, should I wait or is it a good time over here with commodities about to go for a run? Any tips on best areas in Perth?

445 2018-11-03 00:15:02 ¿te soy sincero? no es ni mala la idea, los commodities nombrados, TODOS son commodities especulativos, a veces están en alza, pero a veces llegan a caer estrepitosamente, no puedes anclar una economía a algo tan volátil.

490 2018-11-02 20:54:24 There's rationing that effects all forms of commodities. In Uk they do so with shortages of services& providers,in Canada they do it with absurd time delays,& here price does effect demand,but of the above free market is the most efficient,not pareto optimal,but respects freedom.
491 2018-11-02 20:49:47 O cara acha que a China está roubando nossa fatia no mercado. Que poderíamos estar produzindo nossos produtos ao invés de importar da China. E desde quando Brasil tem condição de abrir o mercado e competir com China, EUA, etc? Brasil só produz e exporta commodities!

495 2018-11-02 20:09:37 A social reality exists. It is smothering the planet with commodities and control, imposing a pathetic and miserable existence of enslavement to authority and the market everywhere.
496 2018-11-02 20:09:08 I totally agree, but we have to be mobile in this world, where labour and commodities are fluid on a global level. So, that is why I pledge for railway service as the state provided mobility backbone (cheapest way to travel), because of the earlier mentioned reasons.

506 2018-11-02 19:27:45 The price differential is spin. 

The market for bitumen is completely different than the market for sweet crude oil.

Comparing the price of those two commodities is nonsense.

507 2018-11-02 19:21:26 Bueno, ahí tenemos otra falacia. Los precios dolarizados de commodities sirven como medida en un país o dolarizado o sin una inflación del 45% o sin una devaluación anual de la moneda de casi 90%. Esa libertad de mercado tan apetecible, funciona en otras realidades, no acá
508 2018-11-02 19:20:32 Based on that assumption, we can also talk about it theoretically more in depth... I think today, in this globalised world, where there aren't geographical barriers for commodities, we have to be mobile and there is a human right for mobility,...

They shot a Black Rhino VALUED AT US$120000. The mere fact that the animal has a price tag on it tells you that they are already seen as commodities meant to be traded.
533 2018-11-02 17:27:30 Historically, there has been a bull market in the commodities every 20 or 30 years.

538 2018-11-02 17:13:23 Lol.  Unfortunately you’re even more naive considering I work in oil and gas, I know exactly where all the big commodities lie. So I think you ought to do your own research
539 2018-11-02 17:12:13 I don't doubt the veracity of such an article coz am living it. Basic commodities are not even available and when one can manage to find they are so expensive it's better to learn to do without.

541 2018-11-02 17:10:32 Para mi el precio del petróleo es francamente indescifrable. Lo que sí suelo ver en commodities es que cuando hay un exceso mínimo de oferta o de demanda, los precios sobrereaccionan mucho.
542 2018-11-02 17:09:25 I just read on teh internets that only the US is monetarily sovereign because ... commodities are priced in USD.

552 2018-11-02 16:30:43 Life is indeed hard my sister ....... on top of the tax we are also faced with price increases of commodities businesses  have reacted by passing on the burden to us povo.

578 2018-11-02 14:38:17 It comes down to economic environments. October was one of weakening expected growth and lower inflation. This hurts stocks and commodities, and helps bonds. If inflation fears had instead picked up, then it would have helped commodities, but hurt equities.

608 2018-11-02 13:23:24 GST is not a new or additional tax. It's just many existing taxes in one. If not anything it has reduced tax on most commodities and opened state borders. Now those who were evading tax earlier are forced to pay due to stringent compliance. So don't spread wrong info pls.

610 2018-11-02 13:21:53 I’ve been blessed to see or even granted a opportunity to meet wonderful woman from eKasi. Some I even grew up with, amazing souls that want to do good but because of the environment and exposure, they’ve turned into commodities  .
611 2018-11-02 13:18:42 What if strong PM/commodities led to strong AUD? Higher PM/comm prices led to huge capital investment in mines etc around the same time US is devaluing coming out of the dotcom crisis.
612 2018-11-02 13:17:21 According to ECA studies, Africa is less industrialized today than it was 3 decades ago. The continent’s manufacturing share of output and exports has steadily declined, and Africa’s exports
remain largely concentrated in primary commodities and raw materials. #AfricaFreeTrade
613 2018-11-02 13:10:06 Items that have trended upward in price this week seem to have levelled off except for a few shot supply commodities; Traditional Thanksgiving items generating more interest causing some upward trends on them.  Overall trading is adequate but not robust

615 2018-11-02 12:47:41 Just saying. Kenapa syarikat2 ladang getah mengaji penoreh sebagai staf tetap dgn pendapat minima negara. And instead of selling commodities, the company should focus more on local processing and market higher value product.

622 2018-11-02 12:34:55 I'm receiving this as sealioning and manufactured offence. If you believe that animals (56bn slaughtered per year) are less like humans than like commodities or vermin, I am sorry but that says more about your view of animals than my views of slavery or the Holocaust.
623 2018-11-02 12:32:57 250K jobs vs 190k expected.  Seems inflationary and supports rate hikes.  I have a small TBT position, although not looking to add here.  More interested in the action in PMs and other commodities.

647 2018-11-02 10:34:43 Inclusive o mercado de maconha se organiza no mundo. Como somos conservadores, vamos ter que nos contentar com o papel de exportador de commodities.

650 2018-11-02 10:22:51 Tell me something new as It was quite anticipated on the back of 

1) hike in oil prices amidst Ruppee devaluation paired with higher Brent oil prices which caused the prices of other commodities to increase.

2) pass on impact of gas prices during preceding months..
651 2018-11-02 10:19:05 to practise their faith without fear of prosecution.
i) Whether our economy is expanding or contracting, is our currency rising or falling,whether price of essential commodities are increasing or falling.
 We have to simply look for ourselves all these facts and make judgement...
652 2018-11-02 10:18:38 The problem is that nickel did not even reach the top 10 most traded commodities in the world (that honor belong to sugar; oil; natgas; coffee; corn; etc)
And if you divide the value of New Caledonia nickel imports with it’s populations it’s not even close to 2000$/ person.
653 2018-11-02 10:15:39 An economic system predicated on dirt cheap commodities is completely unsustainable. Long-lasting products made with care are not the cause of poverty, a capitalist system consuming x2.5 the Earth's resources (x5 by 2060) is the cause of poverty.

726 2018-11-02 05:11:23 Sei ...e as commodities, como fica?!
Explica isso pra gente!
727 2018-11-02 05:00:02 Commodities: Rice +2.30%, Ethanol -1.56%
728 2018-11-02 04:53:01 Cara, a demanda de commodities vem da China para o Brasil, não dos EUA para o Brasil. A China precisa de soja e proteína (eh a maior população do mundo), e o Brasil fornece. A cadeia de commodities china-brasil é o que sustenta o agronegócio atualmente.. a leitura
729 2018-11-02 04:50:28 Mas se a demanda de mercado de commodities vem da China, não dos EUA, que sentido faz isso?? Repito, a grande demanda do agronegócio, p. Ex,. É chinesa, pq ela tem bilhões de pessoas. Vc ACHA que é ideológico, eh uma questão simples de mercado estar voltado para a China
730 2018-11-02 04:36:56 Profitable morning have a nice trading day, every its possible to make profit, just need to unlock the strategy

731 2018-11-02 04:25:20 Então o Brasil tem o que a xina não tem, todos acham que a grande população chinesa basava para vender produtos mas lá esta ficando caro tanto para produzir como vender!
America do Sul é um mercado interessante por causa das commodities que no oriente esta em falta!
732 2018-11-02 04:09:32 Proliferation of low-quality commodities, dubious food ingredients, etc are easily pass through the Bureau of Customs (ehem).
733 2018-11-02 03:55:50 .@BrucePoliquin =TRUMPIST= .@POTUS supporter. Is this REALLY kind of America we want?

735 2018-11-02 03:47:06 Você é a parte doente da nação. Corrompedora de valores. Lula foi um idiota com sorte que meramente seguiu a política do FHC e surfou nos commodities - incluindo o soja transgênico, que vocês repudiam. Enquanto Moro e o MP já recuperaram bilhões que foram operados do erário.
736 2018-11-02 03:42:36 Could you expand on your macro reasons? Bearish on commodities? Global debt de-leveraging? Or extra serving of « milkshake ». FYI, really enjoyed your RV appearances.
737 2018-11-02 03:22:03 Everything becomes a commodity under capitalism, including the government. Politicians are commodities bought & sold by the corporate class. Legislation is a commodity bought & sold by lobbyists. Politicians (from both parties) represent the corporate class & not the people
738 2018-11-02 03:20:08 I don't mean to be rude, but you didn't know about fungible commodities 45 minutes ago so I'm not really looking for economics recs from you just at the moment
739 2018-11-02 03:19:10 Qual o impacto no consumo das nossas commodities? O Brasil seria muito afetado?
740 2018-11-02 03:10:03 Ohhh! Oh! Oh!! Foi pelo dinheiro! Só por Isso!! As commodities não? Ops!!
741 2018-11-02 03:07:37 La pérdida de valor del peso de 2014-2016 se debió a la caída del precio de los “commodities” a nivel mundial (ej. petróleo). Es decir, cuestiones internacionales. Y MEX sufrió menos que competidores latinoamericanos.

La pérdida esta semana se debió a un mensaje del Gob. Electo.
742 2018-11-02 02:59:57 About 70%. But those aren’t “tracked” for exact quantities so they aren’t on Dept of Commerce data. So that data says 1% of ND exports are to China when it’s probably about 15% when you include commodities. I learned a lot on this story!
743 2018-11-02 02:53:11 Capitalism thrives on  your addiction to its commodities, these commodities include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth etc etc
744 2018-11-02 02:40:27 Oque o Brasil exporta para os árabes? Commodities? E em troca os árabes importam oque? Israel pelo menos é um país próspero e livre comércio, sendo que a maioria dos países árabes são autoritários e possuem uma enorme pobreza...
745 2018-11-02 02:35:45 Although I am bullish the dollar, the only plausible argument I can think of is if China goes on another 2008 style rip roaring spend that takes commodities much higher and the usd falls. This is not my base case though.
746 2018-11-02 02:34:48 Yes, they are. Barrels of oil are interchangeable. One dollar is exactly like another; they're interchangeable. The entire commodities market is founded on the idea of interchangeable commodities.
747 2018-11-02 02:34:36 I am still struggling with this. but likely focus has been equity in this easing focus. 
Industrial commodities have cross collateral and banks have been asked to  focus risks to balance sheet at the same time
748 2018-11-02 02:32:17 It is weird that China announces stimulus and commodities fall. Any ideas why?
749 2018-11-02 02:30:14 total commodities market gotta be way more than 3T tbh

gold alone is like 7T
750 2018-11-02 02:28:05 It will not.
Hindus are expendable commodities.
Police ensures oppression of any attempt to revenge.
And surely no one will not be even booked for the crime, let alone convicted
@USCIRF
751 2018-11-02 02:27:05 Can't make sense. Equity out of sync with commodities
752 2018-11-02 02:23:58 Não esta na hora de deixarmos os pobres venezuelanos com seus problemas caóticos, vivendo momentos de calamidade com um tirano no poder, tentarem viver a vida dele em paz? Pq o PT jamais transformaria o Brasil em Venezuela, basta ver o PIB e as commodities de um País para o outro
753 2018-11-02 02:17:44 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
754 2018-11-02 02:16:11 Commodities look minty
Equities look shitty
755 2018-11-02 02:15:14 Incredible. Priming to give back money he rips out of our pockets but he keeps the tax portion increases on gas and all the commodities that will increase in price. A nice tidy sum in the billion $ range . And done people think this is ok . We’re fu ked
756 2018-11-02 02:13:42 Man this dude over here laughing. Trading impact pack players for unknown commodities.
757 2018-11-02 02:09:23 Trade deals-  i do not know enough about thos to comment.  I can say that in the building industry is and has been effected by tariffs on commodities.  Cedar/ metals etc
758 2018-11-02 02:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
759 2018-11-02 02:06:58 The job of political parties r not to just to win elections but to stand tall on their promises...one of the 1000s of jumlas that @narendramodi sir said then was to bring price control but due to heavy fuel taxation all essential commodities prices r rocket high
760 2018-11-02 02:02:11 End your addiction to drugs by refusing to be a puppet, a social plant, a weed suckling on commodities that destroy your consciousness.
761 2018-11-02 02:00:07 China Growth: 
The Delta one aka Commodities second day of a rough patch after the announcement of policy action 
Iron Ore -2% 
Steel rebar -1.27% 
Coke -1.75% 
Cooking Coal -1.68% 
But Zinc +1.44% 
Copper +0.84% after some steep falls
762 2018-11-02 01:57:58 Roads and Infrastructure, Military defense, Government (legislature, courts, law enforcement). 

Everything else is a commodity. I pay for the commodities I use.
763 2018-11-02 01:51:05 Ahora q cosa con estia gobiernoa de Santos y Uribe , Uribe le dejo a Santos la bicoca de 21 billones/deficit y Santos a Duque 14 billones, q desastre de gobiernos y sibre todo el de Uribe con bonanza petrolera y commodities por los cielos, insisto q DESASTRE!!!
764 2018-11-02 01:47:36 Uribe dejó a Santos un deficit de 21 billones, con petroleo a 100 dolares/barril y la feria China de los Commodities o sea Carrasquilla/Uribe q inutiles y Santos le deja a Duque deficit de 14 billones a Duque muy mal también, pero Santos ni tuvo bonanza petrolera ni feria China.
765 2018-11-02 01:45:01 Finally someone is thinking. Now if we could only have more processing of our grains & crude oil so we are no longer exporting raw #commodities as opposed to value added products.
766 2018-11-02 01:44:42 !!! I AGREE THAT SW IS EXPLOITATION DONT MISUNDERSTAND !!!

Maybe I misunderstood what I've read about commodities, but since the act of sex produces sex relief, it has use value, so with this *particular argument* I feel like it can't be concluded that sw should go.
767 2018-11-02 01:40:26 @ignacionoel1 está buenísimo y felicitaciones! Para cuándo exportar  algo manufacturado? Digo, para dar trabajo y no vender commodities
768 2018-11-02 01:30:31 UT deserves to pay that. The whole mess at UTAD was rotten to the core. And next to the health and safety of football players at ANY school stupid enough to hire Butch Jones? That buy out money shouldn't even be a ping on the radar. Football players are NOT disposable commodities
769 2018-11-02 01:26:54 What cannot be disputed is the fact that prices of basic commodities have been increasing, some at least three times already just this year. The badly weakened peso which also translates to higher prices. Bottomline is many pinoys are much poorer and hungrier thàn previous admins
770 2018-11-02 01:18:33 I underestimated the consequences of this oil selloff for other commodities.
771 2018-11-02 01:11:59 Didn't see that, but BYU would definitely go into a conference if it wasn't for the ESPN contract. They use these athletes like commodities & think that giving them a 4 yr. education is enough when most of them would get scholarships for academics anyways. BYU players  especially
772 2018-11-02 01:09:08 Promoting Shiism in the region no matter the cost is far more strategic for a theocratic government. The priority is not Iranian farmers when government can import cheaper commodities from China.
Iran’s budget for religious entities has more than doubled during the past 5 years.
773 2018-11-02 01:06:54 Jajaja eso es la falacia del socialismo. Asistensialismo no es crecimiento. En la época del boom de los commodities los paises crecieron, pero no por la administración. Apenas cayeron los precios. Adios crecimiento.
774 2018-11-02 00:56:17 1) So we can agree that taxes to fix roads, defense etc. are public goods. Then we get into commodities, I believe that taking another entities commodities, in any form, is wrong without consent. Maybe you don’t know but part of my pen name is Hayek, after FA Hayek.....
775 2018-11-02 00:55:05 @lf_ponde o negócio com a China é que eles absorveram tecnologia de outros países, e hoje querem impedir que Brasil faça o mesmo, se tornando competitivo. Nos querem fornecendo commodities.
776 2018-11-02 00:54:01 Only in power point presentations, earnings grow linear. In real life, as commodities to currencies fluctuate, earnings are usually lumpy.
777 2018-11-02 00:45:42 Não, vamos investindo em pesquisa pra desenvolver tecnologia e reservar alimentos pro mercado interno. Quando bater a fome na Finlândia, no Japão e nos países árabes, renegociamos o valor das commodities.
778 2018-11-02 00:33:03 it’s definitely not concerning that so many people here now think that women being sold as commodities is actually woke definitely a sign of a healthy culture.
779 2018-11-02 00:27:55 Em 2 décadas, mineração cresce 550% no Brasil segundo os Ministérios de Indústria, Comércio Exterior e Serviços (MDIC). A indústria extrativa mineral cresceu 156% no PIB provocada pelo boom de Commodities minerais, e o crescimento da economia Chinesa.
780 2018-11-02 00:13:47 Escobar:"Still, China remains Brazil’s top trade partner – ahead of U.S., w/bilateral trade reaching $75 billion last year. In parallel2being avid consumer of Brazilian commodities, Beijing invested $124 billion in Brazilian companies and infrastructure projects since 2003"
781 2018-11-02 00:08:29 Acho que não é bom para quem exporta commodities. Para a indústria em geral, sim. Insumos e equipamentos adquiridos no exterior baixam de preço e ficam muito mais competitivos no mercado interno.
782 2018-11-02 00:06:26 Bitcoin 2.0 - hopefully this entertained you.. ya everyone is bored as well. Crypto has become like the stock / bond / commodities market - boring. No volatility.
