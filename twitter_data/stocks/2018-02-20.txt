0 2018-02-20 23:59:49 @realDonaldTrump    Give me a break ! You only now want to have Bump Stocks removed ? Americans overwhelmingly want automatic weapons and semi automatic weapons removed and destroyed across America! That and only that is acceptable!! No more Assault Weapons in UNITED STATES

2 2018-02-20 23:59:36 Trump Endorses a Ban on Bump Stocks...
3 2018-02-20 23:59:35 Trump banning bump stocks will not earn him a single democratic vote and will at the same time cost him half of his voting base. Good move you orange ape
4 2018-02-20 23:59:19 They're really not - they just said they'd go along with an executive order to "regulate" them, which could then be challenged in court. The NRA opposes legislation to ban bump stocks.
5 2018-02-20 23:59:14 Trump urges ban on gun devices like bump stocks - he and the NRA paid politicians better start taking action or we will not reelect them. #poorpres
6 2018-02-20 23:59:14 President Trump says that he will withdrawn a memo directing the Department of Justice to develop regulations to ban "bump stocks" because he thought "bump stocks" was a code word for female genitalia. 
7 2018-02-20 23:59:14 We’re in Boulder tonight! The City Council will be asked by Councilwoman Grano to consider banning assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks. No decision will happen tonight. More to come ...
8 2018-02-20 23:59:11 Is there anything other than practical proposals? 
Ban bump stocks is literally trending right now. Banning assault weapons, specific weapons (AR-15s), requiring training, getting rid of Gunshow loophole
9 2018-02-20 23:59:10 Trump takes executive action to ban bump stocks...
10 2018-02-20 23:59:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
11 2018-02-20 23:59:00 The Vegas shooter used bump stocks. Those lives don't matter anymore? Piece of shit
12 2018-02-20 23:58:59 In that spirit I applaud Trump for getting rid of bump stocks.
13 2018-02-20 23:58:59 We banned bump stocks here right after Vegas
14 2018-02-20 23:58:55 We just want to live and be able to excersise our 2A in peace were all for banning bump stocks stronger back going checks hell as a gun owner I would even be willing to have a bigger waiting period but if u want my guns u will have 2 take them from my cold dead hands #KilltheNRA
15 2018-02-20 23:58:54 Now there's a rush to buy "bump-stocks".
Thank you, @realDonaldTrump
16 2018-02-20 23:58:52 It’s not even an olive branch. An olive branch would be to propose an actual law banning bump stocks. But our pathetic NRA-owned government can’t even do that.
17 2018-02-20 23:58:29 Ask @SenFeinstein about this: ATF determined in 2013 it did not have authority to ban bump stocks.
18 2018-02-20 23:58:24 It is not often that I agree with @realDonaldTrump. Banning bump stocks is the right thing to do, and I applaud his directive to the Department of Justice.
19 2018-02-20 23:58:23 WOoOOw give him some credit man, banning bump stocks wasn't an easy task.

40 2018-02-20 23:58:15 Today I agree with you fully. Trump has asked JD to ban bump stocks va good start. How about some recognition?
41 2018-02-20 23:58:13 within days of the vegas shooting our state senate voted unanimously to ban bump stocks.  possession could land you life in prison.

THIS KIND OF STUFF SHOULD BE A NO-BRAINER
42 2018-02-20 23:58:00 He’s not backing a ban, he asked his DOJ to explore the legality of it. He’s paying lip service to this tragedy and shouting out to his base, “buy your bump stocks now.”
43 2018-02-20 23:57:46 Impressive rel str appearing in leaders with room to run $hubs $grub $shop $nflx $vips #stocks
44 2018-02-20 23:57:45 Banning bump stocks is a step in the right direction, but we demand more
We must #BanAssaultWeaponsNow
We must enact stricter #GunControl
We must kick the @NRA out of politics
@realDonaldTrump @PressSec @SpeakerRyan @FLGovScott @marcorubio @GOP
45 2018-02-20 23:57:43 The article you pointed me to says bump stocks make it easier to fire more rapidly, so if we can ban them we can at least reduce the ability to have semi automatic rifles potentially fire as rapidly as automatic ones.
46 2018-02-20 23:57:38 Banning bump stocks is somewhat effective but not as effective as, oh I don't know, banning assault rifles all together?
47 2018-02-20 23:57:38 I don't give a damn about your bump stocks, I just attach the Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator on my Picatinny rail...
48 2018-02-20 23:57:35 Until you see the paperwork and figure out what it means, you have no idea if anything will happen to bump stocks.  It may all be word play and theater to give the appearance of action.  Call me skeptical.
49 2018-02-20 23:57:24 We'll see how much traction this has. Call me cynical, but at the same time he was making this announcement, the FL House was refusing to vote on a bill to ban assault rifles. Diversion? No to bump stocks, yes to assault rifles. IMO, not much of a concession.
50 2018-02-20 23:57:22 So now you don't want bump stocks banned?  Man, you shitlibs are so confusing!
51 2018-02-20 23:57:18 Not so much. The AZ Republicans also voted to not allow debate on outlawing bump stocks.
52 2018-02-20 23:57:16 How many bump stocks have killed people?  Aren’t the bullets doing the actual killing?
53 2018-02-20 23:57:14 A birthday is not a charity drive. You guys should be making money for us no asking us for your birthday. Tomorrow I’m duping all stocks
54 2018-02-20 23:57:09 it's bad enough that we can not build our own F.A. weapons/I believe that "shall not be infringed" means if its available we, the people can have it/when full auto was banned it had a grandfather clause for existing F.A. with a permit/if they ban bump stocks will it have a clause
55 2018-02-20 23:57:04 Trump pushing the Justice Dept to ban bump stocks is the first good thing he's done as "President." President in quotes because Hillary Clinton actually won the 2016 election.
56 2018-02-20 23:56:59 @SenFeinstein stated that bump stocks aren’t subject to federa regulation per ATF. They need legislation. So his little memo is just optics so it looks like he is doing something. Once again he hasn’t thought this through
57 2018-02-20 23:56:52 Now that @POTUS has banned bump stocks we should get one maximum security asylum built. Let's see liberals chomp at the bit for that, I mean if they're serious about fixing the problem.
58 2018-02-20 23:56:52 And a total of FOUR bump stocks were turned in, in the entire state!
59 2018-02-20 23:56:48 Bump stocks is my bad, since the mass shooting in Vegas this is old news Brian
60 2018-02-20 23:56:38 I prefer the stocks and stones better too
61 2018-02-20 23:56:26 Pleasantly surprised that President Trump is trying to ban bump stocks, it’s not a solution - but it’s a start.
62 2018-02-20 23:56:26 Question: Can this actually happen? The bump stocks, I mean? There seemed to be some question of legality.
63 2018-02-20 23:56:19 Why ban bump stocks?  They weren't used in Florida.  Ban the damn AR-15!!!! #impeachtrump #trumpisinsane #trumpisatraitor #trumprussia
64 2018-02-20 23:56:10 Obama admin OK's bump stocks YEARS ago......but its the GOP's fault......they are legal.......people like her are why we cant have nice things.
65 2018-02-20 23:56:09 I guess if it did no damage it wouldn't have any purpose but to stall, but since it does damage it's actively used to take a stock. Without damage the wobbler would just be playing to not die / waste time but with damage they're playing to take stocks and end the game.
66 2018-02-20 23:56:08 Hey, @realDonaldTrump , thanks for throwing gun violence a bone on bump stocks. Now get out of our White House. "Las Vegas" #Resist
67 2018-02-20 23:55:59 This took no courage whatsoever. Even the NRA is soft on bump stocks. Trump will do nothing the NRA opposes.
68 2018-02-20 23:55:59 @realDonaldTrump   Good job on the bump stocks. Im a registered Republican and pro 2nd amendment. Get rid of the AR's too. Only police and military need that power. Keep it up. We will win if you do and say the "right" things.
69 2018-02-20 23:55:56 Gun Owners...All of you who are joining the “one less gun” movement....THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING AMERICA’S GUN PROBLEMS!!! Responsible gun lovers realize that bump stocks, extended clips, & semi-automatic weapons are more dangerous than they are worth...PLEASE TELL CONGRESS!!!
70 2018-02-20 23:55:50 Dear , don’t let @realDonaldTrump fool you. Banning bump stocks is not enough. Do not let it appease you. Demand more. #GunContolNow #GunReformNow
71 2018-02-20 23:55:45 Mind you, the assault weaponry that you think you are talking about has been banned in the US for 20+ years. A select few have the permits required to buy these type of weapons. They are already banning bump stocks (with which I agree). Just here to educate ya bro;)
72 2018-02-20 23:55:44 This evening we are talking about banning bump stocks.  No one will ever use a rife with a bump stock to mass kill, but I guess it sounds good.  Rifle becomes much less accurate with a bump stock.  Ban high capacity mags, etc.
73 2018-02-20 23:55:38 Misleading headline - President Trump ordered the Justice Department on Tuesday to “propose regulations” to ban so-called bump stocks. That’s all folks.
74 2018-02-20 23:55:20 you do realize a .223 hunting rifle and an AR-15 are the exact same weapon , same rate of fire and same capacity ?one is gas activated one is recoil activated and they have different stocks.other then that , same weapon .just cause it looks scary doesn't make it more lethal
75 2018-02-20 23:55:19 I hope to god CDJapan stocks that concept art book
76 2018-02-20 23:54:52 ATF determined bump stocks were not regulated by law & did not allow him to prohibit them. Obama issued a slew of executive orders for stricter gun control; Trump administration rolled back in 2017 a measure that previously prevented people with mental illness from buying guns.
77 2018-02-20 23:54:51 Bump stocks should not be banned. Mass murderers will commit mass murder with trucks, explosives, etc. 
The purpose of the 2nd Amendment is to ensure that the People are able to resist govt. tyranny. The People must therefore be armed with weapons sufficient to serve this purpose
78 2018-02-20 23:54:48 Don't be a asshole. We all know Bump Fire stocks were not used in Vegas and they sure as fuck were not used in Florida.....so WTF
79 2018-02-20 23:54:42 Banning bump-stocks: a bit of political theater, just a scrap being thrown out to appease the angry masses. If these jerks think the wonderful students protesting for gun control won’t see this for what it is, they are sorely mistaken. #GunControlNow
80 2018-02-20 23:54:36 Ummm wasn't it the democrats that said bump stocks were acceptable for civilian use
81 2018-02-20 23:54:24 Who decided on listening and solving real problems, in the White House, by asking to create Law, to outlaw Bump Stocks?   If the WH wants America to listen, the representatives for the WH will not BS  US!
82 2018-02-20 23:54:17 Overly broad law. Not surprised it failed. Florida ain't California or New Jersey. 
Interestingly, a Mini-14 with a non-folding stock is OK, one with folding stock not OK. We all know how deadly those folding stocks are.....and bayonet mounts or barrel shrouds are worse.
83 2018-02-20 23:54:11 For @realDonaldTrump to move NOW to ban bump stocks is a slap in the face of every single victim of the Las Vegas shooting & the Florida students. #TheResistance
84 2018-02-20 23:54:05 But I’m not opposed to banning certain guns. Trump backing banning of pump stocks. Hopefully it happens
85 2018-02-20 23:54:01 When did the NRA become part of the legislative branch? 
“After the shooting in Las Vegas, congressional Republicans and the N.R.A., who for years have resisted changes in gun control legislation, expressed a willingness to consider a ban on bump stocks.”
86 2018-02-20 23:53:56 Melania, thank you. 

I am pretty sure you used your power to influence the President, to order legislation against bump stocks. Please continue to help the toddlers and children and teenagers and young men and women of America.
87 2018-02-20 23:53:53 We were told days after the Las Vegas massacre that Congress was going to ban bump stocks within days. Why has it taken 4 months for @realDonaldTrump to bring this potential ban up again?
88 2018-02-20 23:53:52 So you say but a disproportionate amount of the EU's fish stocks are in what were UK waters! Heath gave them away. Do you support that? Or support the struggling fishermen?
89 2018-02-20 23:53:46 Total diversion. Anyone who knows how bump stocks work knows they aren't the central problem/their manufacturer is small time. This is a diversion from the real issue: high capacity assault rifles as an expensive and profitable sector of gun sales, available to almost ANYONE.
90 2018-02-20 23:53:23 The problem isn’t bump stocks.
91 2018-02-20 23:53:22 I just read something about the bump stocks it trumps getting in behind and if I'm not mistaken when the dude did it at the hotel off there and California they already did that where was you at maybe I'm wrong but I think they've already did that
92 2018-02-20 23:53:10 I would agree but I learned from another post that bump stocks were approved during Zero’s administration. So symbolically he can continue to demolish his legacy and DJT can say at least he did something. The left will never be satisfied.
93 2018-02-20 23:53:05 Automatic fire is inaccurate, and most military troops do not fire their rifles on that setting. Bump stocks are also expensive to obtain and expensive to shoot with each bullet costing about 30 cents. That adds up fast. I don't have one or want one.
94 2018-02-20 23:53:05 @IvankaTrump I like your idea on banning bump stocks and improving background checks.  Maybe we need to raise the age of gun ownership to 21?
95 2018-02-20 23:53:00 He won’t though. Banning bump stocks would admit that stricter gun regulations work.
96 2018-02-20 23:53:00 Trump's smoke and mirrors giving out Public Safety Medals. He will not ban assult rifles and he pretends to stop bump stocks, but he knows nothing will happen on the federal level. Trump is a manipulative FAKE president. He is a deseptive liar. He is a curse on humanity. #plague
97 2018-02-20 23:52:47 @RepAdamSchiff @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @ananavarro Don’t fall for the banana in the tail pipe. Remember the memo? The committee voted to release it. Trump basically vetoed it.  Trump is “FOR” banning bump stocks.  The house and senate will not.  The Ole Switch-a-roo.
98 2018-02-20 23:52:44 This is more bullshit. Bump stocks allow many more bullets shot inaccurately. That said most military will tell you that one can bump fire and semi automatic rifle with their belt. It’s called belt-bumping. #bumpstocks
99 2018-02-20 23:52:39 We’re Still in a Day Trader’s Market.  Very little follow through—in Most Stocks.  #MarketTimer
100 2018-02-20 23:52:29 Bump stocks are not guns, just a piece of hardware that makes guns more lethal re rate of fire, banning them makes sense.  Other pieces of hardware make guns more lethal too, re. accuracy/power, eg tripods, scopes, laser sights, magnum rounds.  Where does banning stop?
101 2018-02-20 23:52:22 Bump stocks aren't the only problem.
102 2018-02-20 23:52:17 Good that bump stocks are being banned. Need more.
103 2018-02-20 23:52:17 I side with @POTUS when he's right. Bump stocks should have been banned years ago. You cannot aim with them. They are not allowed on most shootings ranges as a result. They serve one purpose: To spray bullets at a crowd with machine gun speed.

Good for Trump for backing a ban.
104 2018-02-20 23:52:12 This is what Republicans will do to avoid a serious move on #guncontrol:
1) Attack #NeverAgain kids by saying they're being used by the left as pawns
2) Propose something meaningless like banning bump stocks knowing it will never pass
3) Say they tried and move on
105 2018-02-20 23:52:06 And now comes "If they take our bump stocks our guns are next" in 3, 2, 1.....
106 2018-02-20 23:52:00 @realDonaldTrump I like your idea on banning bump stocks and improving background checks.  Maybe we need to raise the age of gun ownership to 21?
107 2018-02-20 23:51:57 @realDonaldTrump #NoCompromise Sir, do not ban Bump Stocks, they are gimmicks and if you give in at all we all lose.  Stay Strong and No gun control, none, no compromise.
108 2018-02-20 23:51:53 Presumably including UK fishermen who also fish stocks from other “waters.”
109 2018-02-20 23:51:50 These scans are bottoming stocks with previous support sometime in the past in multiple time frames. $NL $NNBR $NP $NRE $NYLD/A $OCSL $OHRP $OMER $PCRX $PMTS $REXX $RHE $RLGT $RNN $RRTS $RUSHA $SGU $SHY $SN $TIS $TRTN $TTPH $TYD $UPL $VMIN $WEB $WHG $WLB $YCS
110 2018-02-20 23:51:46 And he went directly to a party and then golfed. The truth always comes out. Did he consider attending the memorial service held at school or one of funerals? Going to hand pick the children he listens to tomorrow? Bump stocks were not used in this shooting. Ashamed of you all
111 2018-02-20 23:51:40 Ban bump stocks and ALL the other things that would make these bums stop.
112 2018-02-20 23:51:39 @BretBaier @SpecialReport Charles Hurt says Bump stocks are “beautiful graceful machines”.  This is an embarrassment to your program.  Please stop.
113 2018-02-20 23:51:35 @realDonaldTrump pls don't ban bump stocks, you will lose a lot of support
114 2018-02-20 23:51:33 Trump just won points with people that don't pay enough attention to know that bump stocks have already been discussed
115 2018-02-20 23:51:32 Thank you for this. But outlaw bump stocks, automatic weapons, and high capacity magazines! These are weapons of war being aimed at our children, they are not sporting items.
116 2018-02-20 23:51:15 Banning bump stocks not enough. Banning assault weapons is the answer.  These students need to be heard!
117 2018-02-20 23:51:11 What work are you doing from a golf course..sending more #thoughtsandprayers? @FLGovScott is blaming the @FBI yet the Florida House wouldn’t even listen to the kids today in Tallahassee on #GunReform. We need a #BanAssaultWeapons now, not just bump stocks.
118 2018-02-20 23:51:09 "Trump directs DOJ to craft ban on 'bump stocks’”

Don’t be fooled, this is meant to placate you. Banning bump stocks will not do the job. This is typical political behavior: “give the rubes something so they’ll shut up.” Don’t fall for it. Stay angry.
119 2018-02-20 23:51:06 A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Bump Stocks, shall not be infringed?
120 2018-02-20 23:51:04 Did you know that the NRA wanted ATF to ban bump stocks but the Obama Admin decided not to? I think they wanted more mass shootings to have the excuse to ban all weapons. I guess they figure that banned firearms is more important than dead bodies
121 2018-02-20 23:51:03 And it hasn't actually happened yet... There was talk about banning bump stocks after Vegas... Then time passed...
122 2018-02-20 23:51:00 @realDonaldTrump Banning bump fire stocks makes nobody safer. People were bump firing rifles long before bump fire stocks were invented. No special equipment needed. Besides, bump firing makes a shooter FAR LESS ACCURATE.  #2A #NRA #MAGA
123 2018-02-20 23:50:58 Now that I know how to manage stocks, bonds, have an accountant and a financial advisor, can someone please teach me how "coupons" and "cash back" works? Thanks
124 2018-02-20 23:50:54 Smart not to have a knee jerk reaction. Potus is already working to ban bump stocks and discussing stronger back round checks. A healthy start. Definite need to end gun free zones and have arm guards as we do in airports, train stations, hospitals...  Create a school type of TSA
125 2018-02-20 23:50:43 I was just having the same thought this afternoon hearing Trump conversing about bump-stocks. Huh?  

I said to myself, "Well, this is certainly an aversion that America will pick up on." Let the kids handle gun control while Mueller handles #JailBird #DonTheCon."
126 2018-02-20 23:50:43 @CharlesHurt @stephenfhayes @ChuckLane1 bump stocks are the result of ingenuity and wording of the law. Sportsmen and enthusiasts aren’t really interested because they make shooting inaccurate. 2A erosion is my only concern. @BretBaier #SpecialReport @FoxNews
127 2018-02-20 23:50:36 The left: “We need to ban bump stocks!” 

Right: “Let’s have that conversation.” 

Left: “Okay, Let’s ban silencers (suppressors), Assault Weapons (already banned w/out special licenses), AR-15’s, Semi-Auto rifles, & change the 2nd Amendment while we’re at it!” 
#GunControlNow
128 2018-02-20 23:50:24 @SpecialReport Instructions for homemade bump stocks are easily found on the internet.
@CharlesHurt @ChuckLane1
129 2018-02-20 23:50:20 Bump stocks suck.

They deflect your aim and waste ammo.

They're just a novel workaround to get near automatic fire rates.

Their only utility is laying down suppressive fire and burning rounds because it's fun.
130 2018-02-20 23:50:05 @Glouie @StockPiker I hear you and why I like using puts for shorting. Way too many stocks fall into that same category.
131 2018-02-20 23:49:44 I hope POTUS really does achieve what no one has yet managed - banning bump stocks and finding “evidence-based solutions” to school shootings.  A good start!
132 2018-02-20 23:49:42 What does banning bump stocks solve? That doesn't stop criminals from killing people! Bad call @realDonaldTrump ! Bad call!
133 2018-02-20 23:49:40 I’m ok with this. And the people who are defending bump stocks are categorically idiots IMO
134 2018-02-20 23:49:39 $n $nxttf looks like namaste has posted the revised financials on Sedar (net loss is lower by around 100k). Also they have posted the final prospectus seems like the bought deal is closing soon
135 2018-02-20 23:49:38 @realDonaldTrump long time supporter. Please don't listen to people trying to advise on emotion about gun control. Bump stocks and ar 15s are not the problem and controlling them is not the solution.
136 2018-02-20 23:49:24 OUTRAGEOUS to hear @ChuckLane1 @stephenfhayes @FoxNews @SpecialReport push DESTROY#2A &#Constitution our inalienable God-given rights, specificallyGOVT SHALL NT INFRINGE on#2A ,period”! #SelfDefense #SELFDEFENSE ADDRESS real cures&fixes&leave bump stocks ALONE! @CharlesHurt
137 2018-02-20 23:49:10 Wrong. There’s a simple and fast solution. Ban AR-15’s, improve background checks and bam bump stocks.
138 2018-02-20 23:49:08 Millions of bump stocks are out in public now
139 2018-02-20 23:49:02 With the pretend ban on bump stocks that Trump mentioned, these manufacturers are going to get a huge increase in business now. Bet they're happy. They probably discussed it w/ Trump over the weekend.
140 2018-02-20 23:48:58 I don’t use them. I don’t even own a gun. Banning them is only a way to begin the ban parade. I didn’t know they existed until Vegas.  They were not using bump stocks. They were using full auto guns. The Bump stock is a red herring. Don’t be fulled by the official lies.
141 2018-02-20 23:48:41 Should we consider deep value as an extension of value or you look at deep value stocks differently? Thank you!
142 2018-02-20 23:48:35 How about the guns bumper stocks were designed to go on.. The NRA was willing to give into a bumper stock ban right after Los Vegas, but nothing was done because  we were moved on. So they are using it now, when a bumper stock was not used. #NRAIsATerroristOrganization
143 2018-02-20 23:48:18 Trumps giving in and throwing the libs a bone, he's going to ban bump fire stocks. We better hope and pray it's a long time bfore antoher shooting happens because the anti gunners are gaining steam with all the media lies behind them.
144 2018-02-20 23:48:03 It looks like $uav is sharing a booth with #cse. $uav should be the poster child for the CSE as it is a real company with real revenue with real potential
145 2018-02-20 23:48:02 @realDonaldTrump if you ban bump stocks (which take lots of practice) you will just be forcing people to learn how to convert their semi-autos to fully automatic weapons. And if you don't know a fully auto will fire 5xs as fast as a bump stock!! Which would you rather have?!?
146 2018-02-20 23:47:58 I sense some sarcasm and irony at the same time. A big step by Trump in banning bump stocks that convert semi-automatic guns into machine guns whilst a strong affiliation with NRA.
147 2018-02-20 23:47:57 Bump stocks approved by Obamas admin(ATF) , so yes liberal gun laws.
148 2018-02-20 23:47:56 How about looking into why so many of our young people want to mass-murder their classmates in the first place, John? Is anyone looking into that? Because that's the salient question and the one that makes me fear for the next generation of adults' futures, not bump stocks.
149 2018-02-20 23:47:49 @Delblogo Let's be real tho. Banning bump stocks changes nothing. It wouldn't have changed anything in Vegas if he didn't have one.
150 2018-02-20 23:47:41 I think Trump's so-called ban on bump stocks is a distraction. You know something is fishy when the NRA isn't screaming bloody murder. We can't take our eyes off the prize...#GunControlNOW #NRABloodMoney #guncontrol
151 2018-02-20 23:47:40 We both know bump stocks are a joke and can be replicated different ways. I'd be fine with banning them to make the liberals happy if that would stop them but they won't stop till no guns are allowed...
152 2018-02-20 23:47:34 The only real concern here is that they'll write it too broadly (the left will try) so as to ban all kinds of things that aren't bump stocks, because they're fucking psychopaths.

They deserved no concessions, IMO.
153 2018-02-20 23:47:33 Obama legalized bump stocks.
154 2018-02-20 23:47:29 Please. Stop commending him so quickly. Bump stocks is a no brainier but we need a full ban.
155 2018-02-20 23:47:28 That's horrible. That guy was on some extra stuff, with all the weaponry he had. Bump stocks need to go....those things are specifically for mass destruction.
156 2018-02-20 23:47:25 He can't have DOJ do anything like ban bump stocks. It has to be legislated. This is strictly a dodge.
157 2018-02-20 23:47:24 Banning bump stocks not enough. Banning assault weapons is the answer.
158 2018-02-20 23:47:22 @SpecialReport  - what’s with Charles Gray, WaPo, interruption Charles Hurt to say what he thinks the murderer in Las Vegas thinks of “bump stocks”?  This pundit is do anti-Trump and such a liberal hack, why is he on your show?
159 2018-02-20 23:47:11 I see you are banning bump stocks. What part of the Second Amendment do you not understand? You are infringing on our Constitutional Rights! If you continue down this path I will vote against you in the next election.
160 2018-02-20 23:46:57 junior t. shoots his mouth off. senior t. says get rid of bump stocks and Fla. leg. says no to banning assault weapons. ???????????? Putting cops in schools isn't going to help. The repugs. are a bunch of cowards.
161 2018-02-20 23:46:57 Trump banning bump stocks is literally more than what obama has done to banning anything gun related when he had house and senate
162 2018-02-20 23:46:56 This is the kind of crap that will keep getting school children killed. If you think banning bump stocks will solve anything, you're delusional. These schools need armed guards, period. Anything less and these kids will be lambs to the slaughter for the foreseeable future.
163 2018-02-20 23:46:52 With Trump starting the ban on bump stocks you must know NOW you're in the fight FOR your lives, PREPARE!
164 2018-02-20 23:46:45 That's not a good thing to admit. Banning bump stocks is good. Give credit where credit is due (assuming it actually happens) and propose more regulations if you think they will help.
165 2018-02-20 23:46:45 For the first time, Trump did something I agree with. Banning bump stocks is a must. The only problem is it took him 395 days to do something right.
166 2018-02-20 23:46:38 Of course it is the bump stocks that kill people not the guns or the users.
167 2018-02-20 23:46:37 He’ll get bump stocks banned and then a month later quietly deregulate suppressors.
168 2018-02-20 23:46:32 @DavidMuir Getting rid of bump stocks isn't enough. More needs to be done on gun control.
169 2018-02-20 23:46:29 Banning bump stocks is a step in the right direction but more needs to be done.
170 2018-02-20 23:46:18 It is only bump stocks. Blame the NRA. They came out after Vegas shooting and said that they would support a bump stock ban. Potus is just taking his cue from them. He should repeal the gun free zone act and require armed security on schools. We will see what happens i guess.
171 2018-02-20 23:46:17 It is imperative that a ban on assault weapons is connected with a ban on bump stocks & strengthening the vetting on backgrounds checks, i.e. Mental Health Issues. This is a must do, each of these must be done together and be part of a single bill. GOP must listen! #NEVERAGAIN

173 2018-02-20 23:46:06 He wants to ban bump stocks.
174 2018-02-20 23:46:06 @realDonaldTrump asks for ban on bump stocks. How do those on both sides of #GunContol debate see this? Details @komonewsradio  throughout the afternoon.
175 2018-02-20 23:46:04 If the NRA and the gun lunatics can’t agree that bump stocks should be banned, it gives great insight into how sick they really are. Those that support the production of bump stocks would be the first I would put on a no firearms sales list.
176 2018-02-20 23:45:58 Chuckles, you can’t even give the @POTUS one congrats for undoing the Obama admin’s OK to sell and use bump stocks????  Your pure partisan approach to everything make us want to throw up...CHUCK #SchoolSafety
177 2018-02-20 23:45:51 Bump Stocks are being outlawed as we speak.
178 2018-02-20 23:45:44 Banned bump stocks to prevent becoming auto but not ban automatic weapons? Hmmmm
179 2018-02-20 23:45:41 .@BretBaier They had a weak consensus with the pro gun side to do something about bump stocks after the Las Vegas shooting. To do it now will satisfy some anti-gun groups, while taking a path of lesser resistance with the pro gun side.
180 2018-02-20 23:45:32 @CNN @realDonaldTrump did nothing about bump sticks after Las Vegas, now he announces potential of bump stocks being outlawed. His supporters will buy them now & not be outraged if a ban occurs. #GOPHypocrisy #EnoughIsEnough #EmmaGonzalez
181 2018-02-20 23:45:32 yes bump stocks can help with increasing the rate of fire of semi-automatic weapons, and yes there's no need for them on the market and should be heavily regulated. But Fox news saying that semi-auto weapons have a cap on fire rate shows they don't research shit.
182 2018-02-20 23:45:31 After the Vegas shootings, Trump talked about banning bump stocks. How many months later and he’s still talking about only banning bump stocks. I’m guessing when the next mass shooting happens, he’ll still be talking about banning bump stocks
183 2018-02-20 23:45:17 oh, i see what you mean... the 15 ar-15's w/ 100 round clips and bump stocks (making them full auto) used by paddock to fire 1100 rounds in 10 min killing 58 and injuring 851 aren't assault weapons... i guess that means it's all okay
184 2018-02-20 23:44:56 They should be armed with bump stocks also.
185 2018-02-20 23:44:54 Well automatic weapons are already illegal and any modification that make them automatic is illegal as well... they can outlaw bump stocks but they didn’t make guns automatic
186 2018-02-20 23:44:50 went to donations. Wall Street and financial industry donated 1.1 billion in 2016 alone! 3rd... NRA fought for more regulation on bumb-stocks and Trump has stepped up urging they be banned. Obama sat on his hands, cried foul, blamed NRA like you folks and did NOTHING.
187 2018-02-20 23:44:29 Good , we don't need bump stocks, armour piercing bullets , flame throwers. BUT not our guns.
188 2018-02-20 23:44:22 there's obviously oversight. If he does something that congress deems to be corrupt, then the congress has the right to impeach the president.  This whole conversation is about whether or not the President can direct the DoJ to review a ban on bump stocks. He's within his rights.
189 2018-02-20 23:44:20 In the past 48 hours GOP in Arizona 1) blocked a bill to ban bump stocks & 2) made it illegal for Child Protective Service to require foster parents to keep their guns in a gun safe. They are the same everywhere.
190 2018-02-20 23:44:20 Banning bump stocks is not going to fix the problem.
@johnrobertsFox pressed @PressSec suggesting POTUS does not have his own ideas, instead is just hearing from a bunch of other people.
@realDonaldTrump only has ideas about degrading women & ignoring the 99%. He is a traitor.
191 2018-02-20 23:44:12 . @MajorCBS spreading #fakenews on @CBSEveningNews

Fact check: bump stocks DO NOT turn semi-autos into full-autos.

192 2018-02-20 23:44:01 #StockMarket#stocks  If Walmart, the world's largest employer, is having problems you can bet your bottom dollar many other companies will be reporting disappointing earnings. Expect an erratic market response with plenty of opportunities for investors to buy on the dips.
193 2018-02-20 23:43:59 I can’t believe anyone thinks bump stocks were used in Vegas. He had 42 freaking machine guns up there. It was an arms deal gone wrong.
194 2018-02-20 23:43:54 Dear @realDonaldTrump 
Under pressure by young Americans & others you've decided to ban bump stocks. Will you find it in yourself to implement sanctions on Russia and Putin for interfering in our elections? Will you step down, resign, apologize for harm you've done to America?
195 2018-02-20 23:43:53 Bored as hell... So I just bought stocks in 
Wendy's, Rite Aid, Sprint, Teva and a few others... 
196 2018-02-20 23:43:41 I know Barron would never attend a public school, but gun violence can happen in any school.  If Barron had been in the Florida school, I bet 45 would act differently than just banning bump stocks.  No bump stock was used in Florida.
197 2018-02-20 23:43:37 It's probably a red herring anyway. I think I heard on MSNBC earlier today the ATF wrote Congress a few years ago that bump stocks are not covered by existing gun law. That means Congress would have to pass a new law and, well, you know the rest. And so does Trump.
198 2018-02-20 23:43:36 @realDonaldTrump I was really hoping to see something about the bump stocks. You finally do some useful and not a peep. Just continuing, embarrassing tweets.
199 2018-02-20 23:43:36 I would take an unenforceable ban on bump stocks in exchange for allowing our school personnel to be certified and armed on campus.
200 2018-02-20 23:43:24 Already, Trump's suggestion to outlaw bump stocks is being spun by media as him surrendering to pressure. This is why we can't have nice things.
201 2018-02-20 23:43:22 Bump stocks were used in one mass shooting. Assault rifles are used in almost every mass shooting. It's a meaningless gesture.
202 2018-02-20 23:43:21 Oh, he'll say he got bump stocks confused with hump socks and blow it off.
203 2018-02-20 23:43:13 Trump signs into legislation to ban bump stocks. Personally I don’t care because I didn’t know they existed before Las Vegas, yet people still are shitting on him for doing what they asked, y’all are fuckin stupid.
204 2018-02-20 23:43:11 You tried to ban Muslims with Executive Orders, where’s the Executive Order banning assault weapons?...bump stocks are not enough!
205 2018-02-20 23:43:11 That’s fair. I am unaware of the history of this gesture. And my understanding is that bump stocks are one avenue of side-stepping.
206 2018-02-20 23:43:11 BLACK FELLOWSHIP stocks slump
207 2018-02-20 23:43:06 Bump stocks is a tricky thing to ban. According to the law, an automatic rifle shoots multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger. The bump stock uses multiple pulls of the trigger to make it an automatic firearm. Trust me the ATF has been trying to find a way
208 2018-02-20 23:43:05 Wow bump stocks today, tomorrow gun oil and bullet polish
209 2018-02-20 23:43:04 WTF do bump stocks have to do with the #FloridaSchoolShooting @realDonaldTrump? How about a ban on the CIA or MK Ultra, or even liberals?
210 2018-02-20 23:42:54 #SpecialReport I don't think anyone cares if they get rid of bump stocks no one will care. Just remember it was passed/approved under Obama.
211 2018-02-20 23:42:50 bump stocks were ruled legal under the Obama administration and Feinstein's first Assault Weapons Ban bill was so poorly constructed that it ended up reviving the NRA inadvertently due to constitutional issues - then it expired itself out after 10years as cases flooded court.
212 2018-02-20 23:42:49 Bump stocks were added as legal by ATF under Obama administration. Any other modification to a weapon to make it simulate auto fire is akreafy ILLEGAL!
213 2018-02-20 23:42:19 Dear Mr. President,
Criminals will always have guns. So I feel a ban on 'bump stocks’ or any other gun control legislation will not satisfy the left; they will only be satisfied when guns are completely banned. Only arming school officials can reduce school shootings.
214 2018-02-20 23:42:17 In the meantime a lot of bump stocks are gonna get sold
215 2018-02-20 23:42:12 Calling for looking into regulations to ban bump stocks -- /now/ -- is such an empty, gestural shrug. #Enough
216 2018-02-20 23:42:09 @realDonaldTrump Soooo, it's time to ban bump stocks, huh? Too little, too late. Ban assault rifles!! NO ONE outside the military needs any kind of military hardware! If someone NEEDS to use military hardware, JOIN THE MILITARY!!
217 2018-02-20 23:42:08 You want to ban bump stocks but not assault rifles? Twiiisted
218 2018-02-20 23:42:06 Police forces have actual assault weapons.  Not the half measure unreliable bump stocks.
219 2018-02-20 23:42:03 I can roll with banning bump stocks.   So hell I have some ground.
220 2018-02-20 23:41:59 Obama was to busy legalizing bump stocks!
221 2018-02-20 23:41:56 Glad we’re on the road to banning bump stocks though. Baby steps.
222 2018-02-20 23:41:55 @realDonaldTrump...how about we ban the guns the bump stock is used on...BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS. Banning bump stocks alone is a photo-op…nothing more. Have just a tiny bit of genuine courage for once and call for a BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS OF ANY KIND.
223 2018-02-20 23:41:53 It’s bcuz bump stocks are worthless for that gun anyway
224 2018-02-20 23:41:51 @realDonaldTrump well, I never trusted you and your actions just showed me why.  Consider yourself one and done! You just lost millions of votes by banning bump stocks. #DumbDonald
225 2018-02-20 23:41:45 So @realDonaldTrump finally got around to looking into banning bump stocks. Now when will Donald Trump do the same for assault rifles? Or will that be after a dozen more mass shootings? 
Sad. Pathetic really.
 Mr. Trump, stop worrying about Russia and pay attention to America.
226 2018-02-20 23:41:40 .@NBCNightlyNews It's not enough to stop the sale of #bump_stocks @realDonaldTrump must prevent the sale of automatic weapons deadly guns designed for the only purpose to murder people only the military should have such weapons of mass destruction
227 2018-02-20 23:41:40 Not gonna lie, I'm glad Trump wants to actually ban bump stocks. Not exactly what needs to be done, but it's a step in the right direction. Hopefully....
228 2018-02-20 23:41:37 The NRA must have given GOP the ok 2 ban bump stocks..Prob not a big money maker & NRA/ GOP give a token nod 2 gun reform..
229 2018-02-20 23:41:36 Oddly, the bump stocks on guns pictured in Las Vegas hotel room were on bi-pods...they don't work on bi-pods.
230 2018-02-20 23:41:35 Pick your battles and win the war!!  Agree, bump stocks are easily made at home.
231 2018-02-20 23:41:35 The befogged Blotus said he would issue a memo directing Sessions to investigate banning bump stocks. Unfortunately, Blotus needs to get the GOP congress to pass regulations regarding any kind of gun control.
232 2018-02-20 23:41:32 NEW RECORD! MVP Rapid returns taking 9 stocks off the Falcos in the JMU CB. GGs all~ 
233 2018-02-20 23:41:31 i really do not care one way or another about bump stocks as a part. however, it is the foot in the door mentality of the libs. they don't take an inch. they want the mile. like the picking apart with local and state laws. 1,000 knicks instead of a single blow.
234 2018-02-20 23:41:12 How about instead of worrying about bump stocks we work on ending the terrorist attacks committed by the US military?
235 2018-02-20 23:41:11 And I'm not going to even factor in bump stocks which makes your "non assault rifle" fire faster than the M-16 I used in the military. No one cares about your rifle trivia.
236 2018-02-20 23:41:08 The Obama administration approved the sale of bump stocks in 2010.
237 2018-02-20 23:40:57 Massachusetts already banned bump stocks.
238 2018-02-20 23:40:51 @NBCNightlyNews Note that the NRA agreed after Las Vegas that they’d be behind the possibility of banning Bump Stocks. So Trump doesn’t go against the NRA in any way! This not a big announcement, it’s a way to say your doing something while doing nothing
239 2018-02-20 23:40:47 WTH @realDonaldTrump why are you moving to ban Bump Stocks? They were NOT used in the FL School shootings!! Are you trying to prove that the Left has properly labeled you "Hitler"?
#2A #NoGunBans #NoGunControl #MAGA
240 2018-02-20 23:40:39 Legislators should be legislating, not the chief executive. But I thought the NRA supported a ban on bump stocks?
241 2018-02-20 23:40:29 Banning bump stocks is a good thing. I’m goig to unfollow you for disrespecting Trump
242 2018-02-20 23:40:28 300 million guns in America
Ban bump stocks.. Fine
350 million individuals in America... if a mentally ill or a "mentally angry" person wants to get a gun & do harm they will find a  way.... it is not the gun!
It is smartly getting the gun out of a dangerous person's hand in time
243 2018-02-20 23:40:27 And who gets to decide who's "Mentally ill"? The government? And are government agencies going to go house to house taking people's bump stocks away from them? Where does it stop?
244 2018-02-20 23:40:22 Bump stocks turn a semiautomatic into a automatic, right? Automatic weapons are banned, right? There was a bump stock used in Florida? I'm not sure there was. To me this bump stock ban is just a bone to throw to people asking for a all out ban... Hopefully this will be enough....
245 2018-02-20 23:40:18 Bump stocks do not turn semi-automatic rifles in to machine guns…why? 

Because the pull of the trigger still fires one round. That’s the definition of a semi-automatic rifle. 

An automatic rifle, on the other hand, one pull of the trigger can fire more than one round.
246 2018-02-20 23:40:15 So 45 signed a bill to (attempt) bump stocks. Good start but this was not used in Parkland in the murder of 17.  What will it take to ban AR’s?  These are crowd killers.  45 too afraid to stand up to NRA. @realDonaldTrump . Blood on his hands
247 2018-02-20 23:40:05 What about high powered rifles, then?  I mean there are real differences, right? An ar15 is easier to use an aim than a shot gun, it penetrates some bullet proof materials, it can hold a lot of bullets without reloading and take add ons like bump stocks.
248 2018-02-20 23:40:05 Bump stocks ...really! NOW!
That should have been done right after Vegas! We should be a lot further along with other action by now!
249 2018-02-20 23:39:56 @TheGhostsGhost I think classification of bump stocks as a Title 2 modification is as far as Trump can go. I do know the stocks were deemed otherwise. What's the legal basis now, and will it be challenged in court? The law is very specific.
250 2018-02-20 23:39:55 @realDonaldTrump  thank you for taking a great first step to curb gun violence in our country. Bump stocks serve no legitimate purpose in everyday society
251 2018-02-20 23:39:54 oh bump stocks, its a start, a little late but *slow clap*, how about dealing with under 25's being twice as probable to commit homicide?, or the 30% of perpetrators jailed because of firearms initially sourced from friends and family (responsible gun owners).
252 2018-02-20 23:39:43 One things I can actually agree with Trump on today.... banning bump stocks. Thumbs up.
253 2018-02-20 23:39:41 Hey...good move to ban bump stocks.  Why did FL once again vote UP automatic weapons?  Are these people as insane as you are?  What is WRONG with Republicans?  Can they not LEARN!?
254 2018-02-20 23:39:38 @realDonaldTrump making bump stocks illegal and increasing regulations on background cgecks is not enough.  An Assault Weapon Ban in a must!!

#NeverAgain
255 2018-02-20 23:39:37 Very interesting, now it looks like Trump agrees that bump stocks are a concession worth making (or at least one that can’t be justified for denying).  Keep an eye out for people practicing with their belts at the range 
256 2018-02-20 23:39:33 Yeah, no I think the bump stocks are the problem.
257 2018-02-20 23:39:28 Bump stocks? ... seriously? ... but Trump would still allow loonies to buy all the assault weapons they want ... another pathetic gesture
258 2018-02-20 23:39:27 The bump stock ban is a smoke screen, they'll pass that to avoid passing any real effective gun control bill, they will ban bump stocks and say "See what we did? We did something" #BanAssaultWeapons
259 2018-02-20 23:39:23 Gov @DanMalloyCT on bump stocks: "In Connecticut, we are going to pass a law banning bump stocks and we firmly believe that the federal government should do the same... I strongly urge federal officials, including President Trump, to take a look at our bill" #Ctpolitics
260 2018-02-20 23:39:17 Bump stocks shouldn't be legal—they essentially circumvent the automatic weapons ban. AR only fires 45 per minute, not hard manually.
261 2018-02-20 23:39:09 Wow, @realdonaldtrump, you’re just now taking action on bump stocks. You’re the one who ripped up guidelines on mental health restrictions. You’re a #RunningJoke. Move to Russia with your buddies. #Sad.
262 2018-02-20 23:38:53 Hmmm...so it took 17 more dead people to pretend to ban bump stocks. Wow, I guess the Vegas killings werent enough.
263 2018-02-20 23:38:52 Do a story on how Obama  admin legalized  bump stocks over the objections over the NRA.  Then do a picture of Obama with blood on his hands. Or do one on a hypocrite film maker
264 2018-02-20 23:38:49 NRA already said they werent going to oppose chg in regs in bump stocks. So this doesn’t really tip the scale much. Ban ARs.  No reason for a civilian to have one. Amend the 2nd amendment once and for all!
265 2018-02-20 23:38:44 Glad I purchased a couple bump stocks before the ban...
266 2018-02-20 23:38:37 @JohnCornyn @tedcruz Pls stop bump stocks, stpp automatic weapons, #StopMassShootings
267 2018-02-20 23:38:34 And why the fuck did it take you so long to get around to push for a ban on bump stocks? 5 months is too much.
268 2018-02-20 23:38:29 This has been updated to include orders to DOJ to ban bump stocks, right?
269 2018-02-20 23:38:28 Reduce the velocity of AR ammunition to 1500 FPS and bump stocks stop working. Reducing AR velocity would greatly reduce lethality and still allow folks to enjoy range time. A compromise.
270 2018-02-20 23:38:25 A outright ban may be unconstitutional.... license the use of bump stocks in the same manner that automatic weapons are licensed would be better...
271 2018-02-20 23:38:16 Waiting @NRA to give a statement regarding President Trumps latest remarks on Bump Stocks...
272 2018-02-20 23:38:10 Trump Tells Sessions: "Ban 'Bump Stocks'"
273 2018-02-20 23:38:09 He did it to increase sales of bump stocks & then ATF will defer & we are back to square 1
274 2018-02-20 23:38:09 So what does taking away bump stocks solve?
275 2018-02-20 23:38:05 Not really zero since Don just capitulated to them today with his bump stocks announcement. The score is woke kids 1, righty snowflakes 0, souza -5893
276 2018-02-20 23:38:01 Bump stocks to be banned well Congress just won't do it we all know that but that is only part of the problem assault weapons need to be banned they would not take that argument up either.  Need to #KillTheNRA
277 2018-02-20 23:37:59 Can’t even call to ban bump stocks without blaming BlackJesus... he must be seriously envious of his predecessor.
278 2018-02-20 23:37:45 You announced today that you wanted to ban bump stocks. The shooting last week had nothing to do with bump stocks. The Las Vegas shooting was nearly 5 months ago. What are you doing to prevent people from bringing AR-15s to schools?
279 2018-02-20 23:37:39 Nobody said anything about bump stocks.  Ban them, as they should be.  Kepp up Hector
280 2018-02-20 23:37:33 By the way bump stocks were not used in the Las Vegas shooting those were fully automatic weapons...check the photos @realDonaldTrump don't let the left manipulate you @NRA #2A
281 2018-02-20 23:37:33 #trump talks about banning bump stocks. Did he get the NRA ok. Last time this was mentioned 2nd amendment “experts” complained bigly. Are they now ok with this because #FakePresident is. Boy are they going to be pissed.
282 2018-02-20 23:37:28 Didn't this previously have something to do with trading bump stocks for concealed carry permit recognition across state lines?
283 2018-02-20 23:37:21 Trump called for a ban on bump stocks and the left is calling it meaningless. It’s something...if you’re asking for progress, appreciate the baby steps.
284 2018-02-20 23:37:20 Bump stocks & BG checks..we need to go so much further but will take balls. We need gun registration, licensing of owners, natl Data base for LE, age restrictions, purchase waiting periods of 30 days and longer for concealed permits. NO mental health possession, No auto weapons.
285 2018-02-20 23:37:19 Probably the first and perhaps only executive action of trumps I agree with is the ban on bumper stocks. One of the first visible attempts to reduce the gun control in America. Though I doubt congress will allow this.
286 2018-02-20 23:37:18 I agree. Bump stocks are just a little morsel so they can say they did SOMETHING. Meanwhile, AR-15s will fly off the shelves and into the hands of the next mass shooter.

Fucking gun Nazis.
287 2018-02-20 23:37:10 No one needs bump stocks.
288 2018-02-20 23:37:02 A bump stock is a piece of wood or plastic...keep your damn stocks and ban the weapon it attaches to!
289 2018-02-20 23:37:02 Its actually a bullshit move on Trumps part. The ATF doesn’t have the authority to ban bump stocks so this would be tied up in litigation for years. It’s a ploy
290 2018-02-20 23:37:01 Agent Orange acts like a hero for banning bump stocks, but he can’t do it on his own the republican house and senate need to go against the NRA, we will see how that works out
291 2018-02-20 23:36:57 Banning "bump stocks" is addressing the LAST mass shooting. So we are one massacre behind. #WorldNewsTonight
292 2018-02-20 23:36:50 New word for lame stream media, bump stocks. They will say this over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again
293 2018-02-20 23:36:49 @BretBaier Got your panties in a wod about bump stocks? If you knew what an echo trigger is you’d probably have a cardiac episode.@SpecialReport
294 2018-02-20 23:36:45 Banning and outlawing bump stocks is a good first step, though. They make semi-automatics almost half as deadly as a fully auto. It should have been done last November after Stephen Paddock's rampage in Las Vegas, NV. Why did Trump wait an additional 3 months?
295 2018-02-20 23:36:35 Trump beordrer forbud mot «bump stocks»...
296 2018-02-20 23:36:30 Even Trump has banned bump stocks. Gun control is needed more than ever.
297 2018-02-20 23:36:14 Bump stocks are not gun so I really don't care about them. And better cooperation with background checks is not a problem either. But when you talk about banning certain weapons without providing real armed security at the schools is a non-starter. WE NEED TO WAKE UP NOW!
298 2018-02-20 23:36:09 This story makes me sob every single time I read it.  Tired of this sh*t.  Does NRA now stand for National Russia Association? They must really think we are a bunch of morons.  Well, we're not. Coming after your assault guns, bump stocks, background checks..#EnoughIsEnough
299 2018-02-20 23:36:07 It's about 50-50 now that mainstream media and Democratic politicians start coming out in favor of bump stocks.
300 2018-02-20 23:36:01 Come on Bob, our children shouldn't have to go to school in a battle field, how about you take the guns away from the bad guys then our children won't need armed guards. We're asking for a ban on AR15, ban on bump stocks and sensible background checks. What's so hard?
301 2018-02-20 23:36:00 Hey doing the best that can be done. 1 against 10,000 is tough sledding. should have war weapons and that what bump stocks give u I have AR15 regular weapon gets job done... yes Vegas is FBI thing and there is plenty their to discuss Hope @HouseGOP helps @DevinNunes get job done
302 2018-02-20 23:35:59 @AYuskis @RealJimReuter Policy question:  can POTUS tell DOJ to enforce not selling bump stocks without new congressional laws?  I don’t think so but I might be missing something
303 2018-02-20 23:35:54 Banning bump stocks is nothing more than ignoring what happened in Florida
304 2018-02-20 23:35:50 I guess trump banned bump stocks lol
305 2018-02-20 23:35:41 @POTUS shame on you for capitulating to the gun control Democrats signing an executive order to ban bump stocks instead of protecting our #2A rights like you promised.  What's the next gun control measure you'll cave on and sign?  #2AShallNotBeInfringed
306 2018-02-20 23:35:30 I’m pretty sure even the NRA is against bump stocks!
307 2018-02-20 23:35:19 @realDonaldTrump BUMP STOCKS? You think that's DOING SOMETHING? You're an idiot.
308 2018-02-20 23:35:14 He didn’t direct the ag to ban bumpfire stocks. Propaganda.
309 2018-02-20 23:35:10 to bad the mining stocks are flat.
310 2018-02-20 23:35:06 Again with the bump stocks - reform for those who don't want reform but want to pretend that they do.
311 2018-02-20 23:35:05 @realDonaldTrump Pulling an Obama? Banning bump stocks? You are starting down a slippery slope. I voted for you, but maybe not so much next time.
312 2018-02-20 23:34:54 And keep in mind that @realDonaldTrump proposed banning of bump stocks is ONLY a political move to earn your vote.But,this is the guy who overturned Obama’s law for more scrutiny on mentally ill ppl. #BlueWave #SayNo2GOP #VoteThemOut2018
313 2018-02-20 23:34:53 It's not unilateral action. There's already a law. Trump is asking DOJ how they interpret the law and why bump stocks are legal under it. Under Obama, lots of accessories are interpreted as illegal by DOJ and banned without a peep from anyone.
314 2018-02-20 23:34:48 1. He can't actually direct the DOJ to ban bump stocks. It is outside the scope of the executive.

2. Call me when ANY laws get through Congress pertaining to gun safety.
315 2018-02-20 23:34:40 Bump stocks are just the very tiniest part of the problem. Real gun control is needed not just something designed to placate the Democrats and not anger the Republicans.
316 2018-02-20 23:34:35 He's addressing this NOW. Enough said,  or do you need ur hand held. #ParklandStrong

RT @Perkolator01: Liberals seem conflicted! Should they praise Trump for pushing to ban bump stocks, or call him a terrorist/dictator for trying to ban them?? #bumpstocks #Trump #realDonaldTrump
317 2018-02-20 23:34:30 Leading the network evening newscasts: CBS/NBC: students mobilize in wake of school shooting episode; ABC: Trump acts to ban bump stocks and open to other actions.
318 2018-02-20 23:34:17 If only Nixon could go to China, only Trump could ban bump stocks
319 2018-02-20 23:34:13 Great news that Trump is moving to ban bump stocks but if it feels a bit late its because that was the action the nation called for after the last mass shooting just last October. Four months ago.
320 2018-02-20 23:34:13 And bump stocks only assist in perfecting that technique. It should be noted that bump firing a gun will still not achieve the same rate of fire as an actual automatic.
321 2018-02-20 23:34:09 I thought bump stocks were banned two weeks ago, when I received a letter telling me I had to turn them into the cops if I had any
322 2018-02-20 23:34:04 @realDonaldTrump you’re going to ban bump stocks?! And so it begins. You’re a fucking pussy
323 2018-02-20 23:33:55 Bump stocks are not protected by the Constitution. I call fake account. No one is this stupid.
324 2018-02-20 23:33:45 He's offering that one up ONLY b/c the @NRA already said
(before they did nothing about the #LasVegasShooting)
that they had no problem with the @ATF looking into bump stocks (not doing anything, just looking into it).
325 2018-02-20 23:33:45 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President you are inching your way to not getting re-elected you start with with bump stocks and then it’s our guns. Guns Mr. President aren’t the problem. Sir I love my God, country and family, and so I feel the need to have the right to protect all.
326 2018-02-20 23:33:39 @realDonaldTrump Very disappointing. Bump stocks are stupid but you are exposing yourself as a deep-state puppet messing with the #2ndAmendment LOST MY VOTE AND RESPECT. UNBELIEVABLE. #BETRAYAL #DUMPTRUMP
327 2018-02-20 23:33:36 @POTUS with all due respect, b4 you go banning bump stocks and such for the liberal cry’s. The swamp still needs drained and Jeff Sessions needs to move or get out da way! 2nd term will be unlikely, should things start tilting the other way.
328 2018-02-20 23:33:33 Makes sense. Seems obvious to me since bump stocks have nothing to do with the latest shooting and that’s the legislation that gets resurrected.
329 2018-02-20 23:33:20 No Guns should be banned, but anyone thinking bump stocks are needed are just crazy. It should be classified under a fully automatic and be gone.
330 2018-02-20 23:33:03 Funny how NRA has people confused, thinking getting rid of assault weapons or bump stocks, which were specifically designed to kill people, will lose them their 2nd amendment rights. Trump even loosened regulations to let the mentally ill have guns & people looked other way.
331 2018-02-20 23:33:02 Trump want to ban bump stocks? Hell no. Ban the guns altogether. Bump stocks don't kill, guns do.
332 2018-02-20 23:33:01 In fairness I hope he does, and will ban bump stocks, but this was a bad article by the Times.
333 2018-02-20 23:32:57 Obama never tried to ban bump stocks, did he? Did he not care about "the children?"
334 2018-02-20 23:32:55 ...rights.  Who have made even the STUDY of gun violence by the CDC illegal.  Who successfully slow walked the last effort to criminalize the possession of bumper stocks the last time dozens of people were slaughtered.
What is there role in this?
335 2018-02-20 23:32:48 Yes. Did you listen to Trumps statement about bump stocks?
336 2018-02-20 23:32:47 Assuming Trump follows through with banning bump stocks.  He has a track record of changing his mind when push comes to shove
337 2018-02-20 23:32:36 Breaking News: @realDonaldTrump is asking Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ban bum stocks in hopes that Liberals will keep away from the facts about his collusion. No Dice Bitch.
338 2018-02-20 23:32:33 Gov Malloy weary of President Trump's order on bump stocks. “Unfortunately, this has all the hallmarks of a classic bait-and-switch.  We need more than just regulations – we need to make this the law," Malloy said.
339 2018-02-20 23:32:29 After the Vegas shooting @SenFeinstein proposed a bill banning bump stocks and now Trump is banning them after Parkland when the shooter didn’t even use one? At least we’re getting somewhere I guess....
340 2018-02-20 23:32:29 But you totes win: banning bump stocks will have zero effect “because YouTube exists”. 
341 2018-02-20 23:32:25 If you've got money in oil stocks, then you're making money off oil companies. Stein's taken meetings with Russia, pushed an America First platform of ignoring what other countries do, and has supported Russia's invasion of Ukraine, all good for its oil expansion.
342 2018-02-20 23:32:22 banning bump stocks is a minimal move but I doubt most anti-gun people will recognize that fact - bump stocks aren't needed to bump fire a gun
343 2018-02-20 23:32:15 I see this way too often from the left on Twitter. I agree with universal background checks, gun violence restraining orders, raising age to 21, banning bump stocks & mental health reporting. But these sensible solutions are not the end goal.
344 2018-02-20 23:32:12 I feel that he is just "throwing a bone" to get people to shut up. Banning bump stocks is not enough.
345 2018-02-20 23:32:08 Liberals seem conflicted! Should they praise Trump for pushing to ban bump stocks, or call him a terrorist/dictator for trying to ban them?? #bumpstocks #Trump #realDonaldTrump
346 2018-02-20 23:32:01 Dems did nothing over gun violence but grandstand. Chance 4 Trump. He wants bump stocks gone. If he's wise he'll push 4 more. Most gun owners don't want wrong ppl having guns. He can convince his base,even NRA members don't want their child murdered. 2/2
347 2018-02-20 23:31:55 @realDonaldTrump 
5) There is no way Congress will write a bill banning bump stocks that won't be reinterpreted in the future to ban more, common, semi-automatic rifles.
348 2018-02-20 23:31:50 Looks like only those who are hell bent on shooting people will be the only ones with bump stocks. A person can use their belt loops to as a bump stock, YouTube it if you don't believe me.
349 2018-02-20 23:31:47 @realDonaldTrump Congratulations. You actually directed the DOJ to do something. Bump-stocks should have never been allowed! But cool, you are ready to ban them. Now why are civilians allowed to buy assault rifles. I'm trained for them, but I'm a vet. Most people are not trained.
350 2018-02-20 23:31:45 so we r gonna try to ban bump stocks even tho that isn’t really the common denominator in all these shootings? ok
351 2018-02-20 23:31:41 When the hell will you realize this isn’t a left vs right issue? Greater limits on bump stocks & certain guns & reasonable background checks is common sense. Would the reaction be the same if this had happened at an elite private school?
352 2018-02-20 23:31:39 For the record, no matter what they’re called, they’re much too easy to get. Were 100-round drums, bump stocks and pistol grips available 50 years ago? (Don’t answer, I’m not interested in having a gun nerd debate.) These are mass murder machines that don’t belong on our streets.
353 2018-02-20 23:31:37 Whether or not the ban of bump stocks is good as a matter of policy, where would the statutory authorization for implementing such a ban be found?
354 2018-02-20 23:31:32 Can they explain why they think bump stocks that make semi automatics into automatic weapons is a good thing to have? How quickly they forget the Vegas mass killings. Ridiculous!!
355 2018-02-20 23:31:30 Don't forget Congress was already in the process of drafting legislation after the Vegas massacre and the NRA was amenable to it. This does nothing. Just increased sales of bump stocks by the gun industry. The weapon it attaches to is the problem and high capacity magazines.
356 2018-02-20 23:31:26 Exactly.  So why are they only talking about bump stocks
357 2018-02-20 23:31:17 I don't see how banning bumps stocks gonna solve anything
358 2018-02-20 23:31:17 I’ll trade you bump stocks for suppressors. @realDonaldTrump #TuesdayThoughts
359 2018-02-20 23:31:05 Dear Dictator tRump, if you actually sign into law banning assault weapons and bum stocks. I will start calling President Trump, but you won’t do that so get to keep calling you Dictator tRump. A hunter DOES NOT use an assault rifle to hunt with. PEROID...
360 2018-02-20 23:31:01 Bump stocks were developed under a bogus claim with bribe money from the NRA. THEY knew what the actual intended use was and continued to throw money at Republicans. Those kids are smarter than trump and his entire adminstration
361 2018-02-20 23:30:59 Make Bump Stocks Great Again! #MAGA Wait... What? #2A #ToldYouHeWasntConservative
362 2018-02-20 23:30:40 Sessions will come back with a regulation banning all black people from obtaining bump stocks.
363 2018-02-20 23:30:33 Orphan stocks: Company no longer has enough stock outstanding to accommodate large investors or a spinoff, carved out of a larger firm, often hasn’t yet attracted a following
364 2018-02-20 23:30:30 Bump stocks are a giveaway.
365 2018-02-20 23:30:26 Relax, he has to throw a bone to all of the people sleeping to make it seem like he is "doing something". Even if his proposed laws go through. Who uses bump stocks anyway? Wait until we see what the age requirement will be for rifle purchase. He will protect the 2nd.#TrustTrump
366 2018-02-20 23:30:23 Congress needs to legislate; the bump stocks could be regulated under the National Firearms Act. However, taking suppressors out of the NFA needs to move forward.
367 2018-02-20 23:30:17 Weak response. Treads a little too close to nra greased palms. Of course you ban bump stocks. Unfortunately, this only hurts the Americans that manufacture bump stocks. Maga, indeed.
368 2018-02-20 23:30:14 Every time the stock market has declined, it eventually has more than fully recovered. Hedging the stock market by shorting stocks, or by buying puts on the S&P 500 Index, or any other method usually is expensive, and, in the long run, is a waste of money. -- Ed Wachenheim
369 2018-02-20 23:30:07 RT @SenFeinstein: If the president really wants to ban bump stocks, he will support our bill. If ATF tries to ban these devices after admitting that it lacks the authority to do so, that process could be tied up in court for years. Legislation is the ONLY answer. #BanBumpStocks
370 2018-02-20 23:30:00 So Trump has said he would ban bump stocks-what the killer in Las Vegas used, gee that's more gun control than Obama proposed
371 2018-02-20 23:29:52 Concern voiced by @SenFeinstein: If the president really wants to ban bump stocks, he will support our bill. If ATF tries to ban these devices after admitting that it lacks the authority to do so, that process could be tied up in court for years. Legislation is the ONLY answer.
372 2018-02-20 23:29:49 People who are complaining about trump only now just banning bump stocks. At least he's done something for once 
373 2018-02-20 23:29:44 @realDonaldTrump Banning slide fire stocks is totally unacceptable.
374 2018-02-20 23:29:43 How does it help? 
Does it impact the shooting in Florida? Nope.
Most gun owners will not use bump stocks ever, because you can barely hit the broad side of a barn. 
Even full auto is inaccurate. 
I object across the board to any erosion of our right to bear arms, on principle.
375 2018-02-20 23:29:39 The Wall Street Journal: Trump moves to ban ‘bump stocks’ after Florida high school massacre
376 2018-02-20 23:29:36 Bump stocks meh. If you want to simulate full auto fire I'm fine with it. Do it with a 10 rd mag vs the 100rd mags the Vegas shooter used.
377 2018-02-20 23:29:34 What’s the root cause? 
Bump stocks are just contributor cause 
378 2018-02-20 23:29:31 Lol just a few months ago banning bump stocks was everything to them 
379 2018-02-20 23:29:30 BREAKING: President Trump says he’s directed AG Sessions to propose  regulations to “ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine  guns” like the bump stocks that were used in the Las Vegas mass  shooting.
380 2018-02-20 23:29:27 @realDonaldTrump No ban on bumpfire stocks or triggers. Government has no business regulating what type of plastic stock I can put on my rifle. NOT ONE INCH.
381 2018-02-20 23:29:26 Walmart down 10%. You think it’s a trigger?  Hold on folks. Stocks and cryptos.
382 2018-02-20 23:29:13 Ok here this 1) enforce the laws that are there. 2) do back ground checks even mental health. 3) mandatory training and retraining, fallow up every so often. 4) out law modifying weapons to change how they work like bump stocks and anything that can be used. ...
383 2018-02-20 23:29:12 A ban on Bump Stocks is all that is on tap from Trump. He thinks that will placate them. If the analogy about Nam is correct it won’t. These kids know the organizational power of social media something that did not exist in the 60’s. I wish them well.
384 2018-02-20 23:29:10 Thanks for saying such kind words. I enjoyed that presentation very much.

And, yes, bump stocks are pretty impractical for basically every purpose you could imagine. They serve one role: to turn money into noise.
385 2018-02-20 23:29:02 lol so retarded. Bump stocks aren’t responsible for shit. Dude in Vegas could’ve killed just as many if not more without it. Automatic fire is typically less accurate. Writing laws based on emotional knee jerk reactions is insanity
386 2018-02-20 23:28:52 For the millionth time now 4 semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks. Will you stop and listen to what people want
387 2018-02-20 23:28:50 The NRA announced that it would be willing to discuss bump stocks four months ago, shortly after the Las Vegas concert massacre. How dare Donald Trump pretend this is his idea, and that he (and his Republican partners in crime) are making an enormous concession to Americans!
388 2018-02-20 23:28:47 @TheTweetOfGod I love stocks and stones 
389 2018-02-20 23:28:46 bump stocks make no def.
390 2018-02-20 23:28:46 Gotta say, kudos to Trump for banning bump stocks. Solid move. Shouldn't be the end, but I'm happy to see something happen.
391 2018-02-20 23:28:34 Because military grade assault rifles don’t need bump stocks.
392 2018-02-20 23:28:32 No negotiations, no banning "bump stocks", no DACA deal. Build the wall. Period. Done. End of story.
393 2018-02-20 23:28:31 Gee, I hope your bum stocks are ok! 
394 2018-02-20 23:28:26 WHELP, looks like we got conned by @POTUS! Bump Stocks are stupid, but this is bad precedent for #2Amendment This guy lost my vote for next time. #NoCOMPROMISE2A
395 2018-02-20 23:28:08 US Sen Chris Murphy calls President Trump's directive to DOJ on bump stocks an inflection point in the gun debate. "For the first time, politicians are scared of the consequences of inaction," Murphy said.
396 2018-02-20 23:28:06 What planet are you from?! Most American, from both Red and Blue states support some controls on assault weapons, bump stocks,
397 2018-02-20 23:28:04 Anyone know how to defeat the US military in an armed insurrection if we don't have access to bump stocks?!
398 2018-02-20 23:28:03 Legislation to ban bump stocks would be a start.
399 2018-02-20 23:27:59 This has already been in the works. He’s pandering. Without Congress, this goes nowjere & he knows it. Bump stocks do not change a semi-automatic into an automatic. Talk about “Fake News.” @realDonaldTrump is using this as PR prior to the meeting tomorrow.
400 2018-02-20 23:27:56 Ok so Donnie, (bumpnutz) Bump stocks are NOT ASSAULT WEAPONS!!!! AR15's ARE!!!! No help at all, kowtow to all you're so called followers, they're blind too.. 
(Psst he's stealing you're money too!!!)
#WakeUpAnericaCollusionHere
401 2018-02-20 23:27:52 Good policy.  These stocks should be banned as they violate the spirit of banned fully automatic firearms.
402 2018-02-20 23:27:50 I don't eat KFC but I know there will be a rush to get some when chicken stocks are replenished. Also this will be a great opportunity to experiment on the population. #KFCCrisis 
403 2018-02-20 23:27:50 @NRA So what are your thoughts to Donald Trump wanting to ban bump stocks?
404 2018-02-20 23:27:37 I'm going further, I'm going through my 401k and eliminating any company or stock that includes AR-15 manufacturing or sales of the AR-15 , ammo, bump stocks and other accessories for these weapons of war. May take some research,  but it will get done.
405 2018-02-20 23:27:35 I am relieved to read that Trump is started somewhere with gun control and school safety, and working on bump stocks. A step in the right direction. Presidents Day must have been “reflective” for him too.
406 2018-02-20 23:27:34 I usually come here to gently criticize your tweets. I’m here right now to say thank you for directing legislature to ban bump stocks, it’s a very small step, but it is a step in the right direction. Let’s keep going in the right direction Repeal the Dickey Law, on and on etc.
407 2018-02-20 23:27:33 Alright so Trump is taking my bump stocks away can you libs please shut the hell up about how he’s going nothing about the “gun problem”
408 2018-02-20 23:27:33 so the bump stocks are about as big of the problem as the 13 russians meddling in one of the most corrupt democracies in the world?  #TYTLive
409 2018-02-20 23:27:32 Please read what DT said about ‘bump stocks. A memorandum on something that has been reviewed by tha DOJ for over a year & nothing. All DT did was follow up on something that’s been on going. In short DT patronized you, it’s a dog & pony show. Watch this con man
410 2018-02-20 23:27:29 What is your rally focusing on exactly?   What do u think about Trump wanting to ban bump stocks?
411 2018-02-20 23:27:28 Frankly, we don’t care what you did or didn’t do.  That’s between you and FLOTUS.  Go focus on Gun Control - Ban the Sale of Guns to anyone on a watch list.  Ban bump stocks (good start, but make it happen).
412 2018-02-20 23:26:59 Interestingly enough Trump is talking about banning bump stocks. I was shocked to hear this kind of talk from the GOP.
413 2018-02-20 23:26:50 I am not a hard core gun guy. I think there are some things we could and should look at. I also understand the fact that an AR isn’t a military rifle whether it looks like one or not. I don’t think anyone could really give me a good argument not to ban bump stocks.
414 2018-02-20 23:26:40 Yes it is,but bump stocks are not protective,there just a piece of plastic
415 2018-02-20 23:26:35 Milk stocks strong all around - juniors $JAT $BUB $BXN yesterday. #A2M beats today.
416 2018-02-20 23:26:25 Who knows? None of us do.
But I do know if the shooter had hand guns there’s more chance to stop him when reloading + less rapid fire
Listen I don’t want to see any more kids die &AR’s, bump stocks, more guns is not the answer.
It’s your right to own a gun - for sport/defence
417 2018-02-20 23:26:15 Bump stocks &/or parts to make a weapon automatic. Also adjust background checks to allow for mental health checks (w/ individual appeal rights). Armed Security & metal detectors at schools.
It may also be time to reopen regulated mental health facilities w/client protections.
418 2018-02-20 23:26:10 Except bump stocks are excluded in the current gun laws, so the AG & President can't do anything about bump stocks. Only the Congress can enact a law dealing with them. I just heard this explanation on MSNBC Chuck Todd. It was nothing but a smoke screen by @realDonaldTrump
419 2018-02-20 23:26:08 Trump spent yesterday golfing when he could have been comforting families. He did nothing
about bump stocks until this happened After Las Vegas he did mothing. We have had more school
shootings since January then in any othet time & they keep increasing 
Trump hs played ...
420 2018-02-20 23:26:02 Fake news. (Let's hope it's real, but they talked about this right after Vegas and didn't do anything until Trump got called out by survivors of a mass shooting that didn't even feature bump stocks).
421 2018-02-20 23:26:00 Folks, Remember Cadet Bones Spurs canceled Obama Mental Screening on individuals Trying to Buy a Firearm and 45 even Filmed himself Smiling while Signing! Bum, Stocks can’t kill you, Rifles do!! Don’t be Distracted by the Bone he is throwing!
422 2018-02-20 23:25:59 Mark Levin is currently CHOKING BACK TEARS on the radio because Trump called for a ban on Bump Stocks.
423 2018-02-20 23:25:54 That's not true and I'm confident you know that. But what is true is the Obama admin refusing to ban bump stocks. Something many of you have latched onto.
424 2018-02-20 23:25:40 Don’t let trump banning bump stocks fool you...
425 2018-02-20 23:25:38 POLL: President Trump says he's signed a memo directing the Justice Dept. to ban "all devices" like bump stocks used in the Las Vegas massacre. Do you support it? #bumpstocks
426 2018-02-20 23:25:28 Understand that, but the issue of the legality of bump stocks was big after the Vegas shooting.
427 2018-02-20 23:25:24 Now, whether he understands their function is up for debate.

But, he references the ATF public comments. If ATF is consistent, then bump stocks don't qualify. And Trump gets to say he tried and shit on the ATF for it.

I don't think it's close to what it's being portrayed as.
428 2018-02-20 23:25:23 @KevinMatras Kevin, I follow your positive, fact based, and confident daily market summaries. Also get the Phoenix Capitol market negative comments, ("Buckle Up: Stocks Are About to Begin -The Next Leg Down.") (...S&P headed to 2400 from his fact set. Any comments appreciated.
429 2018-02-20 23:25:17 Dicen que si.. los buitres de las Ocas tratando de comprar los stocks de niños a un mejor precio eso si!! No hay que cerrar... hay que darle apoyo y mejorar infraestructura. Hay que cerrar las OCAS.. no los CREAD!!!
430 2018-02-20 23:25:16 @davidhogg111 
So proud of you and your school mates. Today we were informed that Trump has directed Attorney General Sessions to ban bump stocks, something that has been ignored until you folks turned your grief into activism. Keep up the great work.
431 2018-02-20 23:25:14 Hypocracy...after millions of bump stocks have already been sold..just like the impact of banning assault weapons..so many millions are out there...FREE ENTERPRISE and NO CONSCIOUSNESS
432 2018-02-20 23:25:14 The 2nd amendment is vague enough that a lot could be done. We're not allowed to have short barreled shotguns or automatic rifles. Bump stocks could be taken off the market pretty easily.
433 2018-02-20 23:25:08 Banning bump stocks is NOT good enough. "Baby steps" can kiss my ass at this point, this is morally wrong. #PolicyAndChange
434 2018-02-20 23:25:02 Ari Melber:" The bump stocks ban is a good step. But it's not enough. We should eliminate the loophole in background check. Reinststae the assault gun ban .People who been involved in sexual violence, should not be allowed to get guns."Jerry Nadler D Judiciary Comm.
435 2018-02-20 23:24:58 No he doesn’t deserve shit. Even the NRA approved of banning bump stocks after Vegas. He did nothing. This is a parlor trick to appear as if he cares. As if he did something. We call BS.
436 2018-02-20 23:24:50 Forget Russian jive. Stock 250 drop is reacting to rising interest rates. Unlike the yawn of Russia, rising interest rates stir fears of crowding out, slamming home buyers, competition to stocks.. but..relax. Early rate rises are bullish. Show eco growth increasing...
437 2018-02-20 23:24:37 When the mjority of UK GDP was paid out in wages at about 55%....that figur has declined every year since 1979 as it is syphoned off to stocks+shhare and property,you've been conned mate. now at about 40% and personal debt has rocketed.
438 2018-02-20 23:24:24 If our Congressmen & Senators want to keep their jobs, there will be legislation banning assault rifles, bump stocks & high capacity clips this year!  No more excuses, just get it done or start drawing unemployment, if you can get it
439 2018-02-20 23:24:23 Bump stocks aren't exactly included in the 2nd amendment so... it's possible he can ban,or at least regulate, them.
440 2018-02-20 23:24:18 President Trump says he has directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ban "bump stocks," devices that make it easier to fire rounds quickly
441 2018-02-20 23:24:12 POLL: Amidst cries for gun control following the shooting in Parkland, FL., President Trump says he wants to ban bump stocks, which increase firing speed. Is that enough?
442 2018-02-20 23:24:09 Those mean ole bumpfire stocks that shoot by themselves
443 2018-02-20 23:24:06 Very sad that you hv done nothing to strengthen weak gun purchases; nothing to stop people from buying semi-automatic guns; nothing to ban bump stocks. And you accepted NRA funds for yr campaign. We expect nothing from you. You are a neglect leader.
444 2018-02-20 23:23:56 I equivocated over buying A2M shares at $8-8.50.
And what happens?
I quibbled over buy ALU shares at $13-14
And what happens?
Doh!! #ausbiz #ASX #stocks
445 2018-02-20 23:23:53 @RealDonad_Trump You can print bump stocks on a 3D printer.  Why not institute mandatory mental health background checks?  If we had those in Florida, 17 people would be alive.
Man up.  This is about what’s more important...your children or your assault rifle .
446 2018-02-20 23:23:51 This is so much bs & it’s way too late. ONLY reason Trump is doing this now is NO FINANCIAL BACKLASH as the CO.  that makes bump-stocks FILED for BANKRUPTCY less than a month ago so BIG FRIGGING DEAL! It’s a TOTAL JOKE RE GUN SAFETY ! BAN SALE of SEMIAUTOMATIC  WEAPONS! Research
447 2018-02-20 23:23:31 All my stocks are down
448 2018-02-20 23:23:21 Sad part is, banning bump stocks will save no one. It wasn't bump stocks in LV. No matter what they tried tell everybody.
449 2018-02-20 23:23:20 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Thank you for taking the first step with bump stocks. We will make schools safe again #MASSA
450 2018-02-20 23:23:17 I have no issue with a @BanBumpStocks initiative.

But, will it be more than a "feel-good-we're-doing-something" bill? Bump stocks look like they'd be easy to 3-D print. Banning them creates a lucrative black market for those who won't follow the law anyway.
451 2018-02-20 23:23:17 Fox News first: A.) Trump backs improving gun background check system...( even though that's not the problem) B.) Major int. Failures helped spur US soldiers deaths in Niger, report says... B.) 3 stocks that posted big gains during
452 2018-02-20 23:23:13 Now that the market has shifted from Bump Stocks to Slide Stocks he can say that without offending the NRA and deadly conversions are still available for mentally deranged individuals.
453 2018-02-20 23:23:10 Banning bump stocks in Feb 2018 (not Oct 2017) is some appeasement Neville Chamberlain would be proud of.
454 2018-02-20 23:22:59 And how many bump stocks have been sold since the Las Vegas shooting? Every guy in the country that knew this this was coming..the bumpstocks are everywhere: Infamous act+ Rumor of ban=Sell Out.
455 2018-02-20 23:22:49 My parents were on holiday in California last year and bought me a pair I love them  will be buying more when I visit LA as part of my honeymoon trip in June  ps we need a store that stocks them in Scotland 
456 2018-02-20 23:22:49 Making bump stocks illegal. Is a start but it's not enough! That should have been done after the Vegas shooting. Get with the program! everybody wants Common Sense gun reform
457 2018-02-20 23:22:42 Was Stocks last time I read.  Delete and retweet, or counting your shekels ?
458 2018-02-20 23:22:40 Is ban bump stocks the only thing in that bill? If It is the only thing, and not mixed in with other things that we do not want, then I would agree that perhaps he can do that. Sir down And talk with him.
459 2018-02-20 23:22:32 So @realDonaldTrump has short-circuited an on-going review. The senate has previously shown no interest in banning bump-stocks, etc. Some senators may have to make a choice on @NRA funds. There's no certainty in this move, and there's substantial risks. No strategy ...
460 2018-02-20 23:22:28 I don’t think so. The fear is always that it becomes a slippery slope. First it’s bump stocks, then semi auto. Then you’ve got people calling a runny nose a mental illness. People are justifiably distrustful of govt. I know I am.
461 2018-02-20 23:22:21 @benshapiro @realDailyWire 
You tend to  vehamenty oppose dumb gun control legislation. I can't find any reporting on The Daily Wire about Trump outlawing bump stocks by executive order. What's up?
462 2018-02-20 23:22:16 Is it possible to issue a regulation to ban bump stocks? I thought it needed an act of congress.
463 2018-02-20 23:22:15 Trump has asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to propose a ban on bump stocks. A #bumpstock was used in the Las Vegas shooting. Not used in the Parkland shooting last week. #bumpstocks
464 2018-02-20 23:22:14 I'm an ardent supporter, BUT, bump stocks were sold to the ATF dishonestly. If they would've come out saying they're a workaround of auto regs, instead of that they're for the disabled, never would've been approved.
465 2018-02-20 23:22:14 NRA has given DT the OK to ban bump stocks, that is not enough.  Simi automatic assault weapons are the issues.  Don't be fooled by DT's disingenuous attempt to make political points. This is a sham!!!
466 2018-02-20 23:22:10 Bump stocks are trash.  They cause a perfectly tuned weapon into a sloppy piece of shit.  Most people can't even shoot with an auto weapon, let alone one that requires recoil to create a fake auto fire.  Alex was terrible with the automatics at the range.
467 2018-02-20 23:22:04 Trump and NRA r only doing this to quiet things down.... #NeverAgain movement is coming to your doorsteps in March. Baning Bump stocks isn't even scraping the tip of the iceberg for gun control.
468 2018-02-20 23:21:59 I own guns but I can't fathom why bump stocks or devices turning a gun into a weapon for maximum kill ok or an 18 y/o ok'ed to buy an AR-15! So, Gun insurance! We all have to have insurance to own a car! Idiots in vehicles kill people all the time! Why not idiots with guns?!?!?
469 2018-02-20 23:21:56 LAST 3 STOCKS OF ELUJAI PROPOLIS AMPUOLE, AFTER THIS I WON'T SELL IT NA HAHAHA. HABOL KAYO SA RAFFLE PROMO AND GIVEAWAY KO

200 per 15 mL bottle lang!
470 2018-02-20 23:21:48 So ban bump stocks.

Then in a few years, you decide to flip on this issue as you have done on many other issues.

Are you going to ignore legislation like you do regarding immigration issues?
471 2018-02-20 23:21:41 Has it been proven that bump stocks were even used in LV? I know they were on some rifles but were they used?
@davidwebbshow was 100% correct about #2A.
472 2018-02-20 23:21:35 Banning bump stocks is like giving a baby a pacifier.
473 2018-02-20 23:21:34 Bump stocks are not the issue Mr. President. False flags are the issue. Please do not a fringe on the 2 nd amendment in any way. I am praying for you.
474 2018-02-20 23:21:26 Thank you @realDonaldTrump for telling the AG to ban bump stocks! They have NO PLACE in our society, and I'm so happy that you are proposing this. Now let's make sure this REALLY makes it way to Congress and we get a YES VOTE! #BanBumpStocks #NeverAgain #ItsAStep
475 2018-02-20 23:21:22 Trumps 3 card monty, look over here I’m banning bump stocks- don’t listen to these kids who have survived a horrible trauma they never should have experienced & who are holding politicians accountable if they are beholden to the NRA instead of the voters who put them in office.
476 2018-02-20 23:21:21 Ban Bump stocks. 

Not enough.

Keep going Trump. You're barely hitting the tip of the iceberg and we're not going away that easy. Hear that, @SenateMajLdr @JohnCornyn @GOPLeader @PRyan? Not a chance in hell that'll placate us when babies are dead.
477 2018-02-20 23:20:55 @realDonaldTrump throwing us this lip service about bump stocks to distract us WILL NOT WORK!
478 2018-02-20 23:20:48 Obama-lots of talk and no action against the second amendment. 
Trump-banning of bump stocks and imposing universal back grounds 
479 2018-02-20 23:20:47 And bump stocks, etc., need not only to be banned, but possession also has to be ruled illegal, with a grace period for turning in the contraband items.
480 2018-02-20 23:20:47 trump signed a directive to ban bump stocks. trump supporters he wants to take away your guns. A republican wants to take away your guns! you always said democrats were going to do this. 
I can’t wait for the backlash on trump for conservatives.
481 2018-02-20 23:20:40 Trump Stocks.  He makes a buck off of everything.
482 2018-02-20 23:20:40 Trump urges ban on bump stocks for assault rifles  now let’s pray it actually works. It’s not all that’s needed but it’s definitely an awesome start.
483 2018-02-20 23:20:39 The effects of 7% rates on lower end consumer (think car & credit) loans will serve as canary in coal mine for larger economy imo. Will be interesting to watch for credit deterioration in consumer bank stocks. May also point to next recession being longer & deeper.
484 2018-02-20 23:20:35 “Trump urges ban on 'bump stocks,' other gun modifiers”

1. ‘Bumping’ is an action that doesn’t require a stock. A finger is all that is needed.

2. “other gun modifiers” is a dangerous slippery slope.

Not good. Needs 

@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @VP @jeffsessions @NRA
485 2018-02-20 23:20:35 Bakit parang stocks na lang lagi nasa isip nya? Hahaha iba talaga pag finance
486 2018-02-20 23:20:34 Bump stocks don't shoot straight
487 2018-02-20 23:20:27 We hope your orders to ban bump stocks only apply to bump stocks. Including other things in this ban would no doubt lead to the liberals interpreting anything they .can conceive into the ban. Democrats don't think logically remember that
488 2018-02-20 23:20:26 News: Trump wants to ban bump stocks

Libs: "He's just doing it to manipulate the stock market for the 1%"

#FacePalm

All shenanigans aside. Does it confuse the left that Trump wants the ban yet Obama approved the use of them? Which side do they choose now?
489 2018-02-20 23:20:21 I didn't vote for President Trump, but  when he does something good like banning bump stocks, you have to appreciate it.
490 2018-02-20 23:20:18 He's #soangrywithrussia he's going to ban bump stocks. That'll teach em!
491 2018-02-20 23:20:16 And then obama's ATF approved the sale of bump stocks. But he acted like he cared so good.
492 2018-02-20 23:20:12 Hello, yes thanks Tuesday was alright   I work in a cafe in a garden centre so I was making cakes today to replenish stocks after a very busy weekend. Hope your day was good.
493 2018-02-20 23:20:12 I call bs on non-correlated. Stocks go down bitcoin goes down. Up and bitcoin up. Non-correlated? I don’t think so.
494 2018-02-20 23:20:06 Of course they’ll all be sold off the shelves by the time the legislation goes through, if ever. Someone might have stock in bump-stocks, for all we know
495 2018-02-20 23:20:05 Fuck you Trump banning bump stocks
496 2018-02-20 23:20:01 Trump to ban bump stocks?
497 2018-02-20 23:19:55 How’s your stocks doing, shakes?!?
498 2018-02-20 23:19:49 Why weren't bump stocks banned after Las Vegas? Only now Trump decides to take action? We have no leadership. Just an asshole who watches Fox News and wants to be celebrated.
499 2018-02-20 23:19:40 also possibly not legally enforceable, as ATF's remit does not extend to accessories that do not mechanically alter the functioning of a weapon. (Bump stocks were deemed accessories in 2010.) See Sen. Feinstein's statement that legislation is required.
500 2018-02-20 23:19:19 Hey, @NRA, thank God The President has come to his senses and initiated measures to ban bump stocks, right? #bumpstocks #MassShootings #SchoolShootings
501 2018-02-20 23:19:12 Detracts from the actual debate, yes. Bump stocks in no way "make weapons machine guns." Jesus Christ. They're there for comfort, not to alter the firing mechanism.
502 2018-02-20 23:19:09 Please Vote & Retweet

How do you feel about the ban on "Bump Stocks"? 
503 2018-02-20 23:19:09 @msnbc @cnn @Morning_Joe @hardball @maddow @TheLastWord @allinwithchris   Headline: "Trump & GOP finally CAVE to DEMOCRATIC party & high school kid's pressure to BAN bump stocks" DEMS & America's YOUTH deserve CREDIT for dragging GOP kicking & screaming to COMMONSENSE gun reform
504 2018-02-20 23:19:08 Apparently conservatives think the Constitution gives them the right to bear bump stocks for their assault rifle. Fuck that.
505 2018-02-20 23:19:07 A step. But @realDonaldTrump what about a ban on citizens buying guns that can be enhanced by bump stocks and/or other modifications?  And at what age? And what mental acuity? #GunReformNow
506 2018-02-20 23:19:07 How about bump stocks? I read that even nra would support that last summer. How about high capacity magazines? What are your opinions as a gun owner
507 2018-02-20 23:19:02 This is Trump frantically trying to change the narrative of the powerful & brave #NeverAgain student survivor movement by banning bump stocks- a move that should’ve taken place in October before 1,000s more were sold. We can’t let Trump use his usual MO of changing the narrative.
508 2018-02-20 23:19:01 Come on Geraldo they are not machine guns !! But I do agree on the age restrictions with inheritance protections and bump stocks were stupid to begin with. My fear is we always chip away the 2nd and not try to fix the root cause
509 2018-02-20 23:18:50 If the president really wants to ban bump stocks, he will support our bill. If ATF tries to ban these devices after admitting that it lacks the authority to do so, that process could be tied up in court for years. Legislation is the ONLY answer. #BanBumpStocks
510 2018-02-20 23:18:49 I am disappointed,  your smarter than this , what he did was instruct the AG to propose (suggest) regs on bump stocks , or in other words waste a couple wks/mths writing regs that will never be implemented because the news cycle will focus on something else eventually.
511 2018-02-20 23:18:48 They have bills in Congress to ban bump stocks, Sessions can't do a damn thing about bump stocks. To me, this seems like nothing.
512 2018-02-20 23:18:42 .@realDonaldTrump Banning bump stocks makes no sense if people can still buy assault weapons.  It's not nearly enough, not even close.
513 2018-02-20 23:18:41 #bumpstocks

So everybody rushes out to buy bump stocks now to make a quick buck and nothing gets banned in the end.
514 2018-02-20 23:18:37 Bump stocks had nothing to do with #Parkland to the extent I know, anyway. The moron in the #Whitehouse made no move on this after #LasVegasShooting though he should have. The issue was clearly stated then.
515 2018-02-20 23:18:32 The time to talk about banning bump stocks was after Vegas. Doing so now just looks like Trump telling Sessions to “get those kids off my back.” 

It won’t work. #EmmaGonzales
516 2018-02-20 23:18:32 Speaker Ryan was supposed to push legislation outlawing bump stocks after Vegas but never did.  He fears the almighty NRA dollars drying up.  #bumpstocks
517 2018-02-20 23:18:05 #ParklandStudents your protest is working!!   Thank you for your courageous action!  

Trump Orders Ban of AR-15 ‘Bump Stocks’ After Florida Shooting - Bloomberg
518 2018-02-20 23:18:03 To be fair, bump stocks are really good for that.
519 2018-02-20 23:18:01 He is going after "bump stocks" that isn't a lie. I said that Republicans would be pushing for more infringements...
520 2018-02-20 23:17:52 Hint Follow stocks on Binance, Bittrex, and Poloiex.  Pay attention to which coins pop together when 80% of ALts are in red. OMG, VERT, PASC moving together.  mark on giant whiteboard or notebook. do this for 30 days 4 times a day cross reference days dates & times. Find patterns
521 2018-02-20 23:17:30 TRUMP now wants 'bump' stocks banned.....
Damn, knew that sooner or later he would do something STUPID!
522 2018-02-20 23:17:22 Stocks just might break ya too
523 2018-02-20 23:17:19 It's not a profile in courage to suggest we ban a gun ACCESSORY months after it was used in a mass shooting so you can APPEAR to be doing something about the most recent mass shooting. Go ahead & ban bump stocks, but don't act like it's got anything to do with real #guncontrol
524 2018-02-20 23:17:12 really?? bump stocks??
525 2018-02-20 23:17:04 Yeah, Trump is considering banning the use of bump stocks, a topic that came up yet again when the Vegas shooting happened. Remember that? It's been 4 months since 58 people died from an AR-15 and nothing was done.
526 2018-02-20 23:17:02 You are right my bad. But their still has to be controls on who has that right to have bum stocks...
527 2018-02-20 23:17:00 If we (millennials) begin finding individual retirement accounts with $3000 per year age 25 and continue through age 65, we would wind up with 2.5 million at retirement (assuming we earn the long run annual compound growth rate in stocks, which is 9.88 percent 1926 to 2011).
528 2018-02-20 23:17:00 It’s a start & - if Trump wants to not only outlaw bump stocks- but re-instate assault weapons ban, create 30 day waiting period, age requirement, mandatory gun training & licensing & gun registration for tracking lost / stolen weapons. Majority will thank him & he can brag BIGLY
529 2018-02-20 23:16:55 I enjoyed the show, but Trump talking about bump stocks "making weapons machine guns" upsets me greatly. Another great example of misinformation and general lack of knowledge of how things work. While I am for more gun control and legislation, I'm very much against fear mongering
530 2018-02-20 23:16:52 And while banning "bump stocks", he allowed for the licensing of persons WITH mental illness to obtain weapons permits. Another perfect example of speaking from both faces at the same fucking time.
531 2018-02-20 23:16:52 One thing at a time.
AR’s need 2b banned, also bump stocks. There’s no good reason for people to own them.
good guy with gun argument doesn’t work, has many drawbacks.
Mistaken toy gun for real gun.
PTSD after a shooting.
Kids overpowering gun owner.
Gun owner having MH issues.
532 2018-02-20 23:16:47 My prediction for all its worth - end result with be a ban on bump stocks, increase age to buy firearms 21 and "enhanced back ground checks".  Everyone claims victory and we go back to discussing Russia, Russia, Russia.
533 2018-02-20 23:16:43 Quick, uh, quick question. And not to take away from the benefit of banning bump stocks, but, how many school massacres have involved #bumpstocks. Just curious. #AskingForAFriend
534 2018-02-20 23:16:36 @NewsHour Note that the NRA agreed after Las Vegas that they’d be behind the possibility of banning Bump Stocks. So Trump doesn’t go against the NRA in any way!
535 2018-02-20 23:16:34 I own S&W semi auto rifle and I have no problem with a ban on bump stocks...signed a proud NRA member.
536 2018-02-20 23:16:30 I have not seen it but perhaps you have. Pres. Trump outlawed bump stocks. I agree but it should be by law not Executive Order. Pres. Obam allowed them via EO. EO’s gotta stop.
537 2018-02-20 23:16:30 But no bump stocks, I think............
538 2018-02-20 23:16:25 In fairness to @POTUS, today he announced that he's looking for a way to eliminate bump stocks.
539 2018-02-20 23:16:24 The AR-15 needs to be banned, not just bump stocks!
540 2018-02-20 23:16:19 Selling my bump stocks, hmu if you’re interested
541 2018-02-20 23:16:17 Like Gartman who trashes crypto all the time and then loses his shit because he invested in Riot Blockchain.   he can’t even get stocks right then he invested in the worst company just because it had “Blockchain “ in the name.
542 2018-02-20 23:16:14 @realDonaldTrump while it's cool ur banning bump stocks they were not used in Sandy hook or parkland. Please act.
543 2018-02-20 23:16:14 @Liz_Wheeler banning bump stocks sounds like a feel good idea, the language to do so is fraught with trouble. I've seen someone , stupid, do the same thing with their belt loop.
544 2018-02-20 23:16:12 You don't know a damn thing about guns stfu. Machine guns were banned in the 1980. Bump stocks don't make a matching un  go find another vault to open
545 2018-02-20 23:16:08 @POTUS only signed a memo asking the AG to look into the change of bump stocks this could take over a year and he's only doing this to make it look like he cares don't be fooled. Lucifer in disguise doesn't care about anybody but himself.
546 2018-02-20 23:16:05 Hmm.. your premise is wrong.  Bump stocks enable a gun to mimic a fully automatic weapon (illegal).  AR-15’s etc. are semi-automatic.
547 2018-02-20 23:16:01 Stocks can cause damage too...
548 2018-02-20 23:16:01 This administration can’t help but lie, deceive, lay blame of everything on everyone but themselves. Trump says he just sign something to start the ban bump stocks, nothing on assault weapons.
549 2018-02-20 23:15:52 @realDonaldTrump you know your in the wrong, bump stocks are just the beginning. You messed up unequivically this time.
550 2018-02-20 23:15:49 Ok you got me with the fact bat..some farmers have shot guns for shooting rabbits but we don't have hand guns, machine/ automatic guns, assault rifles, bump stocks etc. I can nearly guarantee you that the police officer who issues the gun licences most likely doesn't have a gun..
551 2018-02-20 23:15:48 So the Florida House says NO to assault weapons ban, Arizona say NO to Bump Stock talks, but Trump tells Sessions to develop Ban for Bump Stocks, but FUCK Trump.
552 2018-02-20 23:15:46 Please don’t assume to know my political views. I’m just really interested to know how you can interpret the constitution as giving you the right to modify your guns? If that’s true, I need to educate myself better. If it’s not, I don’t think we have a ‘right’ to own bump-stocks
553 2018-02-20 23:15:46 Trump ordered a ban on bump stocks for semi-automatic guns. For once, he finally did something good
554 2018-02-20 23:15:45 How about the ban on bump stocks? Adults or kids?
555 2018-02-20 23:15:45 Do the right thing. *Legislation* to ban bump stocks and conversion devices is the right thing to do. Same with GVROs.* Don't expect an ounce of credit for it; that's not why you do the right thing. Stop tailoring your actions to what the Left will do; that gives them the power.
556 2018-02-20 23:15:42 When I start learning more about stocks and bonds I swear I'll be investing like a motherfucker
557 2018-02-20 23:15:39 Bump stocks para todos y todas
558 2018-02-20 23:15:39 It saved me from foreclosure & homelessness. Worked in nursing for 25 yrs then got cancer. Had to quit working and go on disability for $18K a yr. Luckily I had saved and picked smart stocks. It gave me 15 yrs of an extra $14K per yr which thou not extravagant paid my bills
559 2018-02-20 23:15:36 Good 'ol T. He signed a memorandum directing our AG to propose regulations to ban bump stocks. Not even the issue. Randi Rhodes
once qualified the truth as something you can say quickly. What T did was pump hot air. He did nothing. Fail. Again!
560 2018-02-20 23:15:28 In my opinion, Stocks only do well when the people are getting the shaft.
561 2018-02-20 23:15:26 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I did not vote for you and am very vocal on FB and Twitter about your behavior.  However I’m also grateful for your direction on bump stocks.  It’s a good start.  Thank you Mr President.
562 2018-02-20 23:15:23 How about banning the weapons that bump stocks are used on...no weapon, no need for bump stocks. People will figure out how to alter the weapons w/o bump stocks & they weren't used in most of these mass murders anyway.
563 2018-02-20 23:15:21 Farmers use bump stocks? Really Dave? Those wild hogs right?
564 2018-02-20 23:15:18 I will believe it when I see it. If he says that now, and the GOP says no in Congress, then he can say he tried. And he knows and we know that they will say no to banning bump stocks.
565 2018-02-20 23:15:04 Banning Bump Stocks & Endorsing Mittens Romney. MAGA
566 2018-02-20 23:14:58 Thinking the same, and I'm smelling something different in the air this time around.
The kids can get the job done. 
Trump's already afraid of the March March. Just sent Sessions off to find out how to ban bump stocks.
He did it out of fear - a single motivation.
567 2018-02-20 23:14:58 Bump stocks are a novelty to gun owners. Even they don’t consider it a real accessory. You can make your own using the belt loops on your pants. This memo is much ado about nothing.
568 2018-02-20 23:14:42 Trump is trying to ban bump stocks and I’m happy about it
569 2018-02-20 23:14:39 Please read this it means absolutely nothing ! It says he is ordering the justice department to relook at comments and previous info to determine if bump stocks are illegal. He isn’t proposing they are ilalegal or even asking  the justice department to determine they are illegal
570 2018-02-20 23:14:39 I’m tired of Republicans talking only about background checks and bump stocks because they think that’s all their base will accept. We need gun control now. Let’s call it gun regulations. As in “A well regulated militia...”
571 2018-02-20 23:14:38 So now our lying chameleon of a president says he wants expanded gun background checks and a ban on bump stocks? He's lying but I hope it's driving the gun nuts out of their minds. Didn't he promise to protect their precious 2nd Amendment?
572 2018-02-20 23:14:27 Outlawing bump stocks will not stop a nut job from making one out of a couple of prices of plastic or a 3D printer.
573 2018-02-20 23:14:25 Trump banning bump stocks shows complete ignorance on the issue. Bump firing is a technique, anyone can do it with a bit of practice. Steven Paddock killed so many because he had a balcony view a few thousand ppl trapped in a contained area
574 2018-02-20 23:14:19 President Trump Thanks for signing to stop bump stocks.    Also 21 should be the age to        get a gun. Data base on all patients taking Prozac etc.
Doctors & Schools need to  submit medical on these     patients. 
575 2018-02-20 23:14:19 @cnn @AC360 @donlemon @HillaryClinton #cnn #townhall  So trump response to #parkland is to ban bump stocks it looks like he has his shootings mixed up the bump stock was used in the #vegasshooting almost 5 months ago maybe tomorrow he will ban the #ar15
576 2018-02-20 23:14:16 So 4 months after the Las Vegas shooting he wants to ban bump stocks. That means that in June he might make it so kids can't buy AK15s.
577 2018-02-20 23:14:16 crypto short term momentum exhausted for a short period, profit taking, then resume bull to ATH.  Stocks could precipitate this tmr/next day.  This week is red
578 2018-02-20 23:14:14 He can't ban bump stocks except by legislation
579 2018-02-20 23:14:12 Step one - bump stocks. Keep going! Much to do! Don’t get discouraged always two steps forward one step back. Pace yourselves.
580 2018-02-20 23:14:01 AR15 is NOT a machine gun. Christ you look stupid tweeting stuff like that. It's a semi-auto rifle like 100s of other rifles and guns with less "mean" looking stocks are. So educate yourself on the subject first THEN tweet!
581 2018-02-20 23:13:57 You can attach bump stocks to nuclear warheads? WTF, WHERE CAN I GET ONE?!
582 2018-02-20 23:13:54 So Trump directed the AG to find a way to ban bump stocks.
583 2018-02-20 23:13:53 Bump stocks today, but what next and when is legislation enough?
584 2018-02-20 23:13:51 What a difference banning bump stocks will make, especially considering most Americans had no fucking clue what they were 6 months ago.
585 2018-02-20 23:13:45 For fuck sake. Bump stocks do NOT turn a semi into an auto. For fuck sake!!! People writing laws that have no clue what they are talking about. Better start outlawing people with fast trigger fingers too. Because it’s no different.
586 2018-02-20 23:13:38 Watching the shit about banning bump stocks makes me laugh. It’s not guns, it’s mental health.
587 2018-02-20 23:13:37 @realDonaldTrump Bump Stocks were intended for shooters with disabilities and the product has been abused.  As a NRA Life Member, retired military and security I say it's a prudent move on your part Mr President, MAGA
588 2018-02-20 23:13:36 Banning bump stocks isn’t the same as ar15 or any military style weapon. If you need an assault weapon, your obviously not a good shot
589 2018-02-20 23:13:36 @seanhannity be sure to talk about @realDonaldTrump and banning certain guns and or bump stocks it's our rights NOT THE LEFTISTS
590 2018-02-20 23:13:35 Anyone saying bump stocks make a semi-automatic rifle more lethal has never used a bump stock. It's safe to say barns' broadsides have nothing to fear from bump-stock-wielding shooters.  And you know what? A serviceable belt loop on your trousers is just as effective.
591 2018-02-20 23:13:23 I think he's in over his eyeballs, and I would start selling my stocks sometime soon. @DanaMoore004
592 2018-02-20 23:13:14 You already have a huge win. Trump instructed Attorney General Sessions to implement a ban on bump stocks. We never thought we’d see this. Keep going. You guys rock
593 2018-02-20 23:13:01 @realDonaldTrump 
President Trump don't band bum stocks
594 2018-02-20 23:12:56 No he is not. I am a die hard 2nd Amendment Republican.  But I am against the Bump Stocks.  I can't forget what happened in Vegas!!!
595 2018-02-20 23:12:55 Senator Feinstein has an analysis of why this memo alone won't be sufficient to eliminate bump stocks.
596 2018-02-20 23:12:50 How bout one of your EOs, let’s see you invite the kids in & sign an EO banning bump stocks
597 2018-02-20 23:12:47 I think #Trump put out that notice to his AG about banning bump stocks, etc. is simply a means to satisfy those wanting #GunControlNow

He KNOWS the #Republicans won't act on it...but it allows him to say HE asked for it.

Weak!
598 2018-02-20 23:12:41 The secret to dages perfect complexion and his youthfull physique is the souls of victims he feasts on.... Buy your first soul skin kit today at dages shop for physically undead. HURRY now stocks are limited.(VAT may apply)
599 2018-02-20 23:12:39 Bump stocks? Really? Think that’ll do it?
600 2018-02-20 23:12:27 "Trump calls for ban on bump stocks."

DON'T BELIEVE IT. Nothing will change. It's all for show. If he was serious, he would ask Congress to draft a bill for him to sign.
601 2018-02-20 23:12:22 As a gun owner( I own an AR) I can honestly say that bump stocks are dangerous and unnecessary. No need for one BUT this is a bone to liberals where a bone was not needed. They won't be satisfied with that, they will want our 30 round mags next!
602 2018-02-20 23:12:19 >Trump proposes bump stock ban

Bump stocks are kind of stupid, but so is the full auto ban.
603 2018-02-20 23:12:19 Why bump stocks now when that should have happened when mass shooting happened in Los Vegas. Just another bump and run tactic.
604 2018-02-20 23:12:09 Private and state pensions (those that are funded) also invest extensively in common stocks of public companies.  Wisconsin retirement plans are fully funded; Illinois, run by Dems, is not. #TruthHurts
605 2018-02-20 23:12:04 And don't accept DT's word to get rid of bump stocks, he should have done that months ago when 58 Americans lost their lives at a concert.
606 2018-02-20 23:12:02 Yes it is, and of course it should pass, but do you get what I mean? The NRA has no skin in the game of bump stocks, therefore politicians don't either. But I do hope it passes.
607 2018-02-20 23:11:58 ...not enough. Bump stocks should have been banned a long time ago. We need an #AssaultWeaponsBan and strict background checks.
608 2018-02-20 23:11:55 Should be done after vegas not months after.. This is how strong nra is they can force delay in real enforcing of true reform to make more money first. How many bump stocks sold befire now???
609 2018-02-20 23:11:52 Ban the bump stocks. Ban all semi-automatic rifles. The Gun Lobby offers no solutions and no compromise, so why should we?
610 2018-02-20 23:11:43 I'm an @NRA member and I say kill the NRA. What blows my mind is that liberals hate the gun lobby that has been involved in every gun control measure of the last 50 years. The first lobby group to ask for oversight of bump fire stocks are the idiots over at the @NRA
611 2018-02-20 23:11:32 Bump stocks are not enough! It’s barely scratching the surface
612 2018-02-20 23:11:27 Wait!  Pause!  So you're asking the JD to do what?  Legislation on bump stocks??  Last time I checked it's not the JD that puts forth Policy. Basically Donald Trump's words to the American People=Blah Blah Blah. 
Hey Kids, education is a must!!
613 2018-02-20 23:11:24 honestly they could make bump stocks illegal for all I care I don't use em, when I use my ar15 it's to improve my aim, not to waste 100$ of expensive rounds down range, I use my ak for that. i'm more for enforcing the gun laws we have than adding more.
614 2018-02-20 23:11:15 Looking for the exact wording of the Presidential Memorandum on Bump Stocks... #help
615 2018-02-20 23:11:13 It's a minuscule amount of weapons that can be turned into machine guns. Bump stocks are still semi automatics but they just fire faster. Useless proposal almost like all of his proposals.
616 2018-02-20 23:11:07 The ATF told Congress that they don't have the Authority to regulate Bump Stocks.

Obviously it's not going to work. It's a way for them to generate positive headlines, and the media is falling for it.

We wen't through this after Vegas. No one seems to want to learn.
617 2018-02-20 23:11:06 *considering* banning bump stocks
618 2018-02-20 23:11:03 Bump fire stocks are shit anyway.
619 2018-02-20 23:11:02 Yet it was BHO who said they cant go after bump stocks unlike DT.
620 2018-02-20 23:11:01 Robertson didn’t find reason. Bump stocks are a sacrificial pawn they want to use to distract from the actual guns.
621 2018-02-20 23:10:59 Thank you.  I will educate myself thoroughly.  The President is now advocating making bump stocks illegal so that is a good start.  Would you agree with that?
622 2018-02-20 23:10:48 Trump’s trying to ban bump stocks? No way
623 2018-02-20 23:10:44 Tamara, the only question you should ask politicians is, "If bump stocks are banned, do you think this end school shootings?" This about as useful as removing Burnt Orange from Crayons.
624 2018-02-20 23:10:44 Who APPROVED BUMP STOCKS Obama did 2010.
625 2018-02-20 23:10:34 Trump's concession on bump stocks might seem like small potatoes, but unlike Democrats who fold under the slightest bit of pressure, how often do Republicans ever concede anything? #pressureworks #tytlive
626 2018-02-20 23:10:32 Not much of an effort by @realDonaldTrump to end needless gun violence.  Even NRA didn’t oppose this .. telling AG to “look at it” does nothing!  @senateGOP & @HouseGOP :  Ban bump stocks and assault weapons now. Should have been done long ago & at least after Las Vegas shooting.
627 2018-02-20 23:10:32 Directed is one thing. Actually banning bump stocks will be something different all together. Let's hope this isn't just a smoke screen.
628 2018-02-20 23:10:29 So somebody else went up to that hotel, shot up a bunch of people and left a bunch of guns with bump stocks? (eye roll) 

Also the obama administration had to approve it because it didn't alter the mechanics of how the gun fires. Didn't have the grounds to regulate or ban it.
629 2018-02-20 23:10:18 You falsified what the president said regarding bump stocks. You need a hearing test and not report misinformation. Bump stocks will be outlawed very soon. Rewind the tape and apologize
630 2018-02-20 23:10:18 So it takes 2018 Florida #ParklandShooting for Donald Dumpster to do jack shit about guns and what he does is really in response to 2017 tragedy at Las Vegas (bump stocks), which has nothing to do with Florida shooting circumstances. Interesting.
#GunSense
#fb
631 2018-02-20 23:10:13 @realDonaldTrump Banning Bump stocks marks a surrender to anti-gun lobby. another campaign promise broken just like amnesty for DACA, no action on H1B & other work visas, endorsing RINO Romney. wouldn't be surprised if AR15 are banned.
632 2018-02-20 23:10:02 In 2010 & 2012 the ATF approved the sale of bump stocks to 2 companies, Bumpfire and Slidefire. 

The ATF reasoned that "the stock has no automatically functioning mechanical parts or springs and performs no automatic mechanical function when installed."
633 2018-02-20 23:10:02 That’s it, Im dumping all my stocks in Activision. These two clowns f-ed up two CODs and now they will piss on everything that is left Im sure.
634 2018-02-20 23:09:52 So very sorry for what you & your classmates went through at school David.  You are using your voices for good--already it looks as if you & your classmates have spurred Trump to ban bump stocks.
635 2018-02-20 23:09:49 .@HenryMakow is referring to 2/20/18 @newsmax: "Trump Moves to Ban 'Bump Stocks' on Assault Rifles"- Tsk Tsk @POTUS! You bit the apple!
636 2018-02-20 23:09:45 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS  Bump Stocks is throwing a bone. (Insult) The AR-15 type rifle (semi-automatic) military style rifles must go. I am a gun person but not militaristic crazy that needs this type of rifle.  @FLGovScott
637 2018-02-20 23:09:32 Well-researched article. Exactly why Obama didn’t flatly ban bump stocks years ago. I’m pretty pro-2A but I could give a flying fuck about bump stocks. They’re dumb. That said, only way I see this working is regulate them a la suppressors and require a tax stamp
638 2018-02-20 23:09:21 BANNING BUMP STOCKS IS A GREAT START!!!
639 2018-02-20 23:09:14 Your characterization of a bill also opposed by the ACLU is a lie. 

Also, the NRA supported a bill to ban bump stocks, but your side killed it.

Shame on you.
640 2018-02-20 23:09:08 @realDonaldTrump announced a ban on bump stocks. Well done!
641 2018-02-20 23:08:57 #TYTLive so the bump stocks are about as big of the problem as the 13 russians meddling in one of the most corrupt democracies in the world?  if not way more a problem to be honest.
642 2018-02-20 23:08:56 @realDonaldTrump took yr time to start doing something about bump stocks. Now to ban mentally ill ppl being banned f/buying high power guns.
643 2018-02-20 23:08:46 The bump stock ban is just a fig leaf, a bone thrown to the gun reform movement so the Trump Administration can say they did something. Bump stocks were involved in all of ONE mass shooting, Las Vegas. Don't fall for this con.  #bumpstocks
644 2018-02-20 23:08:46 Simultaneously, Drumpf stepped up to the mike to slur his way into telling us he's informing AG Sessions via 'memo' to begin actions to ban bump stocks. Still think Drumpf has pivoted his way into being called 'President'? Narcissists don't change their spots overnight.
645 2018-02-20 23:08:45 Gun control is not a solution.. neither banning bump stocks.
Protection from vile criminals, metal detectors, armed security is what the American ppl need!
646 2018-02-20 23:08:43 This is hilarious. The democrat base wanted bump stocks banned. Now @realDonaldTrump has proposed banning bump stocks, and the democrat base is suddenly pro-bump stock. #bumpstockban #soangrywithrussia #GunContolNow
647 2018-02-20 23:08:42 Exactly! Are we all supposed to be carrying ARs with bump stocks because we might run into one gun crazed killer? Can’t live our lives running scared.
648 2018-02-20 23:08:36 @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan Let's talk about some sensible gun laws today. Let's not make today be just empty words about bump stocks. It can be a starting point but it's not enough #istodayagoodday #SensibleGunLawsNow  Day 6
649 2018-02-20 23:08:33 I introduced a bill to ban bump stocks three days after the Las Vegas massacre. Republicans haven’t done anything since then. I look forward to reviewing the new DOJ regulations, but there is much more work to do.
650 2018-02-20 23:08:30 Trump is budging he just moved to ban bumper stocks. (Make a semi fire like an auto) (also you have now avoided my first question to you twice no ) tightening the thumb screws
651 2018-02-20 23:08:28 Indeed they are!  And good luck to them in getting any significant Federal action, other then the banning of "bump stocks" announced by Trump today!
Many of them can vote in 2018 and Senators/Representatives need to think about this!
652 2018-02-20 23:08:24 Hey guys, bump stocks are gonna be banned. We can all rest easy now. There'll be no more mass shootings going forward. Our government has finally listened to us. *insert 10 million eye roll emojis here*
653 2018-02-20 23:08:14 A report on MSNBC news cited Feinstein who noted that gun modifications are not subject to federal regulation.  This means that congress needs to pass a law to ban the bump stocks.  I don't know if Trump knew this or not, but at this point, it's a gesture only.
654 2018-02-20 23:08:10 #GunReformNow
#GunSense
Trump asking for a ban on bump stocks is as useful as a wicker bedpan.
#Resist the #TrumpFuckery
655 2018-02-20 23:08:02 Obama allowed bump stocks.....just saying.
656 2018-02-20 23:08:02 And in other news democrats and their lackeys in the media now support bump stocks. They claim Russia is behind the ban.
657 2018-02-20 23:07:58 Bump stocks have some of the same problems with banning that the previous AWB did.  The question is function of the weapon.  Trying to ban a product name or a feature make it easy to get around.  Even with CAs restrictive new laws, there are new ARs that comply with the law.
658 2018-02-20 23:07:43 Republicans over and over vote down any bill that tries to put in place for gun control laws... Trump is probably gonna get heat for trying to ban bump stocks
659 2018-02-20 23:07:43 Bump stocks are bad for your weapon. They are terrible for accuracy
660 2018-02-20 23:07:38 While I agree with you on this being a bad idea, and I don’t support it at all, I DONT believe it’s a genuine action. I do not believe POTUS has any intention on banning bump stocks. It’s more political maneuvering against the leftist democrats who are vehemently anti gun.
661 2018-02-20 23:07:36 As usual, trump, the child that he is, could not simply take the win when issuing a ban on "bump stocks"  He, of course, had to blame Obama. Does this clown have any idea how immature, weak and childish this type of criticism is.
662 2018-02-20 23:07:35 You do know that the Obama administration allowed bump stocks, don’t you?  Any condemnation for Obama?#AskingForAFriend
663 2018-02-20 23:07:31 Christ, you can hear this decision...

 - We need to do something, people might not like me
 - Ban assault rifles, sir? That’s what he used.
 - NO!! The base will hate me, probably shoot me
 - Ban bump stocks?
 - Did he use one?
 - No, but it’ll look like you care...almost...
664 2018-02-20 23:07:29 Kudos to @realDonaldTrump for taking action on bump stocks. Let’s keep it going with reforms (not a repeal) to the 2nd Amendment. There has to be middle ground...
665 2018-02-20 23:07:26 Banning bump stocks is a start. But still need to ban military assault style weapons. Need a better screening process too.
666 2018-02-20 23:07:19 So now they are going to make Bunk Stocks illegal.
I wonder when their going to make trucks illegal. They kill as many people as semi auto rifles.
667 2018-02-20 23:07:19 Banning bump stocks is literally the least he can do.
668 2018-02-20 23:07:18 @LarryHogan The Florida House voted down a motion to ban assault rifles in their state. Please do what you can to ban AR-15s , bump stocks, and extended mags in our great state.  We do not need military grade weapons as citizens
669 2018-02-20 23:07:07 Blahhh haha..Trump did not send a ban proposal to Congress on bump stocks because of pressure. Trump has stated repeatedly before today that he plans on changes.
670 2018-02-20 23:07:01 I have no use for bump stocks.  That said, he just lost whatever majority he had come the next election if it is up to the gun votes unless he does something big for them
671 2018-02-20 23:06:58 Banning bump stocks is definitely a step in the right direction. However, I do feel that the #neveragain movement will have the strength to continue to push for even stricter regulations.
672 2018-02-20 23:06:57 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS instead of outlawing bump stocks...1-make classroom doors bulletproof&lockable from inside. 2-control access to Bldg. 3-Train Volunteer faculty through police depts.
673 2018-02-20 23:06:43 This is good but “Bump Stocks” had NOTHING to do with the Florida school shooting.
674 2018-02-20 23:06:37 Deserves “credit”, not “thanks”.  Still believes diagnosed mentally challenged can own guns, but now without bump stocks. Winning...
675 2018-02-20 23:06:28 97% OF REPUBLICANS for universal bg checks.
PAT ROBERTSON'S come out for assault weapons ban.
TRUMP is ordering the ATF to figure out how to ban bump stocks.

All normal people agree on those. Let's knock them out of the way and then the #teens can fight and win the hard stuff.
676 2018-02-20 23:06:27 Bump stocks are a gimme 

Any utuber can create one
677 2018-02-20 23:06:27 Outlawing bump stocks is a lame attempt to appease the masses!
NOT GONNA WORK, #NRA
#OWM!
678 2018-02-20 23:06:26 Remember that time it took our President 5 months to pass legislation banning the cause of another mass shooting that killed 58 people? That's how this bump stocks thing went down. Teenagers had to wound his pride on twitter before he'd address the wrong cause half a year late.
679 2018-02-20 23:06:20 #tytlive I'm with Jayar, bump stocks aren't going anywhere.  President Lip-service is following is NRA marching orders.
680 2018-02-20 23:06:17 Amateurs use Bump Stocks, lol 
#TRUMPARMY©
681 2018-02-20 23:06:12 You know what? I'll take the bump stocks over nothing. If I can get that, then at least that'll be a small movement in the right direction. Momentum is important, and even a little start can help.
682 2018-02-20 23:06:12 I think somebody in that White House should go over and tell Trump that "bump stocks" are not what he thinks they are.
683 2018-02-20 23:06:09 Just stocks? Meh
684 2018-02-20 23:06:00 Minutes show RBA in no rush to do anything. USD rallies further as stocks fall. EUR was Tuesday’s worst performer #ausbiz
685 2018-02-20 23:05:56 I'm not opposed. But how will such legislation get passed? House members whose districts benefit from military spending aren't just going to stab their constituents in the back. And why should pension plans based on stocks be penalized?
686 2018-02-20 23:05:45 After the Parkland Massacre, Trump asked his High Rollers at Mar a Lago what he should do and they suggested Trump ban bump stocks, like the kind used in Las Vegas, so he did.
687 2018-02-20 23:05:26 I’m willing to see bump stocks banned for one reason: They tend to reduce accuracy.
688 2018-02-20 23:05:24 Congrats to President Trump today for having the balls to ban bump stocks.
689 2018-02-20 23:05:21 @realDonaldTrump Mr President
Banning bump stocks will not inhibit rapid firing of rifles. Unless you intend to ban appendages.
690 2018-02-20 23:05:21 Recommended? It should be demanded Banning bump stocks. And high-capacity magazines. And purchasing a hundred rounds of ammunition at one time.
691 2018-02-20 23:05:19 The delay was probably due to it taking a few months for Trump to understand what bump stocks are.
692 2018-02-20 23:05:07 Guns don't kill people.  Bump stocks kill people.
693 2018-02-20 23:05:03 False.  Markets are always moved by rate of change and not level.  But rates won't bring down stocks.
694 2018-02-20 23:05:03 Agree completely. Ban bump stocks, wash hands of issue, claim credit for doing something, move on.
695 2018-02-20 23:05:00 The NRA is conspiring with Trump to see what crumbs they can throw to make it seem like he cares, GOP, care. Bump stocks are chump change and they've done nothing for 5 months so they just wait it out and do nothing.
696 2018-02-20 23:04:52 prediction: bump stocks will NOT be banned
#hearmenowquotemelater #tytlive
697 2018-02-20 23:04:48 If they're finally actually willing to move on bump stocks, that means they're feeling the heat. We can't stop now, we have to keep the pressure up until we stop our politicians from always putting the NRA first and our kids last. #tytlive
698 2018-02-20 23:04:47 I’d like to thank @realDonaldTrump for ordering a ban on bump stocks.
699 2018-02-20 23:04:44 I don't particularly care about bump stocks, it's frightening to see him going in this direction, PRAY he doesn't cave and give into the enormous pressure he's receiving on the left. They couldn't get him w/Russia or #28, but they can by turning base off w/GC
700 2018-02-20 23:04:41 Ah thanks, Bump stocks and those double-firing tirggers I heard about.  I like that idea, so, how do we define machine gun then? are we gonna go by rate of fire in addition to firing mechanism?
701 2018-02-20 23:04:39 I don’t use bump stocks nor would I buy one, but I don’t need to give the government an inch!
702 2018-02-20 23:04:35 If we had a real President they would know you’d need Congress to ban bump stocks & not the “Justice Department”

But thanks to Russia & dumb scared yahoos we’re stuck w/ a diminished reality tv show host.
703 2018-02-20 23:04:26 How crazy is 
The Government?

They’re still trying to figure out if bump stocks make a gun into a machine gun.
704 2018-02-20 23:04:18 Watch the sale of bump stocks will skyrocket now. #tytlive
705 2018-02-20 23:04:17 Did U notice @POTUS with executive memo to ban Bump Stocks? 
Liberals now claiming its not the Bump Stock but the AR 'assault' gun itself. 
I think I just saw @POTUS get the Liberals to claim Bump Stocks are OK. 
Genius ! 
Try all they like, the AR isnt going away.
706 2018-02-20 23:04:15 #tytlive bump stocks? FFS   #toLittleToLate wont do shit #NeverAgainMSD
707 2018-02-20 23:04:10 Is this nothingness in response to the Vegas Terrorist Attack where the shooter used bump stocks??Because that has nothing to do with the 14 Children & 3 Adults just Slaughtered in their School. So the Russian Terrorist wrote a memo
708 2018-02-20 23:04:08 When we were kids, my big sister learned about the stock market in school & she asked for stocks for Christmas & my grandparents got her a few shares of Disney, is this like a long lost bitcoin situation or
709 2018-02-20 23:04:08 Trump is doing the minimum banning bump stocks doesn’t do much, especially since they can be made on a 3d printer! As can a AR-15 receiver
710 2018-02-20 23:04:05 That's my expectation. The NRA says it's ok to end bump stocks, and Trump gets patted on the head while he claims he "did something that fixes the problem."
711 2018-02-20 23:04:01 The Vegas shooting was Oct 1, 2017 so Trump will do something about the parkland shooting 4 months from now????? He's taking the easy way out, we need more than just Bump Stocks Trump!
712 2018-02-20 23:03:59 I can stand behind this. Makes sense.  I didn’t know bump stocks existed until the Las Vegas incident. And folks with mental health issues should not have access to weapons.
713 2018-02-20 23:03:57 Too much emotion attached to  words "crash,correction" or "bull run". Simply replace with "up trend" or "down trend" to increase your emotional IQ. #EmotionalIntelligence #stocks #trading #markets #forex
714 2018-02-20 23:03:56 I like that it’s been almost 5 months since Vegas & Trump is like, “Let’s distract ‘em. Finally give ‘em some legislation against bump stocks.” Too little, too late, asshole. You wouldn’t even give us crumbs before and we aren’t gonna settle for them now.
715 2018-02-20 23:03:49 Bump stocks are not legal per federal law. I can not for sure cofirm gats.
716 2018-02-20 23:03:46 Fuck Bump Stocks nobody needs a assault weapon !
717 2018-02-20 23:03:45 He sent a memo to sessions to propose considering changes. It's not an EO to ban bump stocks. It's a delay tactic. I'm skeptical ....
718 2018-02-20 23:03:41 I have no faith Trump is ACTUALLY going to ban bump stocks. It's a memo to "request" legislation. So, really it's just a wink and nod. But it's nothing real.

#tytlive
719 2018-02-20 23:03:41 i wouldn't do it... gonna correct hard when stocks drop tomorrow
720 2018-02-20 23:03:39 Trump just did a good thing banning bumps. No reason bump stocks should be legal. More work needs to be done of course, but a pleasant surprise today.
721 2018-02-20 23:03:35 @realDonaldTrump Hey its me,, #DumbAssPresidentDonald You want a ban bump stocks, wow you really put your foot down didn't you. #DumbAssDonald is your head really that far up ur Ass or are you really that Fucking Stupid. #ShowUsYourTaxesTrump  Fing Loser
722 2018-02-20 23:03:27 I have a 401K and it's doing just as well as it was before Trump. I also have several weed stocks that have been up and down, that's just the nature of the beast. Unless you're an active trader, I would assume that most of your holdings are long term? Is that accurate?
723 2018-02-20 23:03:12 Cenk, Biff said he's wanting to ban bump stocks. 

DO NOT CELEBRATE. I'm not AT ALL convinced this will happen. 

#TYTLive
724 2018-02-20 23:03:10 That's true. And....He sent a memo to sessions to propose considering changes. It's not an EO to ban bump stocks. It's a delay tactic. I'm skeptical ....
725 2018-02-20 23:03:08 “...Turn weapons into macine guns”??? Bump stocks can increase speed at which weapon discharges bullets;  I know DJT said it but not true; put in quotes.
726 2018-02-20 23:03:07 @realDonaldTrump YES on bump stocks!  Y can't AR15 be designated as they are, military weapons.  Other weapons r for military only why not this and other machine guns
727 2018-02-20 23:03:00 A reasonable thinking person would have known the day after the Las Vegas tragedy that bump stocks should have been banned. You don't get Applause for dragging your feet and waiting for the next tragedy.
728 2018-02-20 23:02:51 Ah. Wolf doesn't read tweets sent to @CNN and obviously hasn't read Dianne Feinstein's comments about Trump's inability to ban bump stocks, based on his intro. What's on MSNBC, I wonder?
729 2018-02-20 23:02:37 Bump stocks ban? Talk about crumbs. But it will be promoted and accepted as a victory. NRA wins again.
730 2018-02-20 23:02:36 Banning bump stocks and similar devices: *de minimis*
731 2018-02-20 23:02:33 President Trump threw the leftist liberals a bone. Let them ban bump stocks, if a bump stock ban shuts the liberals up but Liberals will still whine about everything President Trump does, including this.
732 2018-02-20 23:02:33 This is what we wanted after Vegas, but now it's not enough. Now we want bump stocks AND assault rifles, background checks, waiting periods, the works.
733 2018-02-20 23:02:32 @realDonaldTrump Ban The Criminals, NOT the guns, nor the magazines, nor the ammo, nor the bump stocks.  America cannot become great again by disarming the law-abiding citizen even more.
734 2018-02-20 23:02:32 Banning bump stocks is a waste of time, an obscure modification that the gun lobby is willing to use as a sacrificial lamb. Ban the actual guns being used.
735 2018-02-20 23:02:31 @POTUS Today it's ban on bump stocks tmw it's rifles next its the 2nd amendment. Then it's the rest of the Constitution. You are supposed to defend the Constitution. Don't give into the leftist tryants. #2ndAmendment #2A #Constitution
736 2018-02-20 23:02:29 @realDonaldTrump s trying to ban bump stocks is the absolute absolute minimum. There still are about 15000(!) ARs or copies among Americans. He will try not to go any step further with gun restrictions in order to safe his NRA donations of 33 million.
737 2018-02-20 23:02:20 #trending #stocks #trading #finance added $BKD
738 2018-02-20 23:02:19 Bump stocks appear relatively  new invention... apparently given ok by Obama administration....WHY? Methinks a long game being played to vilify  second amendment.
739 2018-02-20 23:02:19 Banning bump stocks would not have prevented Parkland’s school shooting.
740 2018-02-20 23:02:18 I can do that.  . ..Bump stocks of all sizes shapes and colors for anything that shoots projectiles are from now until forever banned in all the states and territories of the United States of America. Peroid.
741 2018-02-20 23:02:04 Even the NRA supports getting rid of bump stocks. He just figured this is the least he can do while appearing to be responding.
742 2018-02-20 23:01:59 I think President Trump and these kids should come together and listen and talk. They ARE traumatized and they DO have their feelings. I think this would be the right thing to do. Maybe he can encourage them. He is banning bump stocks. I say vets should be able to help.
743 2018-02-20 23:01:55 I know. But I’ll take what I can get this week. And, bump stocks should definitely be banned.
744 2018-02-20 23:01:55 Thanks for banning bump stocks now give them a deadline so you can sign it
745 2018-02-20 23:01:52 Would have been done, bipartisan, after Vegas if it wasn’t for Dem’s intentional ever expanding definition of bump-stocks!
746 2018-02-20 23:01:50 Bump stocks banned
747 2018-02-20 23:01:46 Bump stocks weren't used in FLA. Not enough. Demand more.
748 2018-02-20 23:01:35 @realDonaldTrump  The president deserves thanks for taking an important first step on gun safety laws by directing the AG to ban bump stocks Let’s hope expanded background checks are next so we can keep military-style guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and the mentally ill
749 2018-02-20 23:01:25 I guess cuz his sons don’t use bump stocks
750 2018-02-20 23:01:21 Republicans won't ban bump stocks because they're a profitable accessory. Guns are only a small part of the picture. Lights, scopes, lasers, grips, sights, stocks, barrels and on and on is where the big money is. Especially on the AR platform.
751 2018-02-20 23:01:21 This is certainly interesting - who's telling the truth? #trading #stocks #cryptocurrency
752 2018-02-20 23:01:20 That bill is garbage. It is poorly worded (likely on purpose) and could result in banning much more than just bump stocks. Present a bill that bans bump stocks only. This shouldn’t be so difficult.
753 2018-02-20 23:01:19 Wow...Trump banned bump stocks!!!Big damn deal. The NRA must see the writing on the wall. Don’t stop the pressure( we need a total ban on assault rifles,period).And, this is just the beginning.
754 2018-02-20 23:01:17 Without congressional action, the NRA will tie the rule up in litigation — first administrative, then in court.  Bump stocks will be available for a long time to come.
755 2018-02-20 23:01:14 BHP shares mirror declines in London at the start of trade and fall almost 5% on H1 earnings miss #ausbiz #mining #stocks
756 2018-02-20 23:01:13 Bump stocks should be illegal. Good call by Trump. Dont worry, you can still go out and stock up on AR 15s if you want.
757 2018-02-20 23:01:03 The assault rifle industry does not care about bump stocks as these are 25 bucks & made by 3rd party nobodies. Only someone spraying a field from a tower needs a bump stock. Even in combat, auto mode rarely used. AR-15s & kin bring in about a billion/yr to gun cos. @ezraklein
758 2018-02-20 23:01:02 Love in the Time of Gun bump Stocks
759 2018-02-20 23:01:01 Naah. Its merely a stall for the gun industry to give cover for Members in Congress who actually need to enact a law to ban bump stocks & other devices or to direct ATF with authority to regulate them as part of NFA.
760 2018-02-20 23:00:51 I'm glad to hear that @realDonaldTrump thinks bump stocks should be banned, but that does nothing to stop what happened at #Parkland  Why did it take the activism of teenagers who lost 17 people at their school last week, and what will you do to prevent that from happening again?
761 2018-02-20 23:00:48 Trump moves to ban 'bump stocks' 4 months after Las Vegas shooting Mr. President is not the solution because bad guys  are geting arms illegally. INsstead put driver license and record to get one. criminals will get arms wherever your measures are. KIll all them all.
762 2018-02-20 23:00:47 $SPY $SPX 12:00 UTC tomorrow. #stocks crash and burn upcoming. Flame on!
763 2018-02-20 23:00:33 If you have a problem with Trump banning Bump Stocks, then you really need to re-evaluate exactly what it is you need a gun for in the first place.
764 2018-02-20 23:00:30 1) Trump is creating a political win-win situation for him on gun control. By signaling his AG to ban bump stocks and being open to NICS reporting and age limitations for semi-autos, he's making an offer and goading Democrats at the same time.
765 2018-02-20 23:00:30 What's the reasoning here to reverse Trump's position on bump stocks? Is it an admission that too many lives have been lost due to assault weapons? Bump stock bans wil not stop further mass murder.
766 2018-02-20 23:00:24 I'm pretty sure police didn't release the info about the bump stocks until November ish. Trump can ask or have something done whenever he asks, but it is still somewhat "classified" so, it was payed attention to by Trump
767 2018-02-20 23:00:19 Cheaper, lighter, universally available, high-capacity magazines, and easily modified into automatics using after-market stocks. Hunting rifles may be "deadlier" shot for shot but you don't bring down a deer using burst/enfilade fire.
768 2018-02-20 23:00:17 Memo: Bump stocks were approved during the Obama Presidency. Why aren't liberals protesting, where's the outrage that the Obama Admin did nothing about gun control or immigration when they had control of the House, Senate & Presidency?
769 2018-02-20 23:00:06 He sent a memo to sessions to propose considering changes. It's not an EO to ban bump stocks. It's a delay tactic. I'm skeptical ....
770 2018-02-20 23:00:02 Trump signs memorandum on gun 'bump stocks'. France surrenders.
771 2018-02-20 23:00:02 Anyone can acquire the know-how for analyzing #stocks.
772 2018-02-20 23:00:02 Deflection.  Just like 45's EO for bump stocks.
Scandal week has spilled over into his entire tenure.  Couldn't happen to a nicer group.
773 2018-02-20 22:59:59 Cmon 600-800 rounds per minute. Show us that magazine. But we get your point. Bump stocks BAD. Outlaw them
774 2018-02-20 22:59:54 I think we should go the opposite way with all this. Instead of banning bumpfire stocks because full autos are illegal/close to it, we should loosen the law on full autos because clearly similar effects can be achieved with workarounds anyway.
775 2018-02-20 22:59:53 Trump’s bump stocks ban today is a start.
776 2018-02-20 22:59:52 @LouDobbs The Prez has surrendered to the anti-gun lobby by banning Bump stocks which is not even a firearm. Another promise broken just like no amnesty for DACA. He hasn't done a thing about H1B work visas either. Why are you silent on these issues where he has broken promises ?
777 2018-02-20 22:59:47 You mean just like Florida U.S. Senators who accept over 3 million dollars from the NRA to vote away safety and security in favor of bump stocks and assault rifles. You vote for murder and slaughter, Rubio. You need to go.
778 2018-02-20 22:59:40 @realDonaldTrump really?  Ban devices like bump stocks? So what. I can find out online how to make them. So now only criminals get them. Raise the age to purchase guns to 21 but permit 18 y/o’s to die for their country in the military?  BRILLIANT!  Paper tigers. We need solutions
779 2018-02-20 22:59:39 I think the person calling him "Lucian Twatwaffle" in the thread was the best. I laughed pretty good at that one. I tweeted earlier that Trump signed an order to ban "bump stocks", devices that have absolutely no business whatsoever being in existence. It's a good first step.
780 2018-02-20 22:59:36 Friendly reminder that bump stocks will be easily banned because the NRA can’t make money off of it.
781 2018-02-20 22:59:36 One question. Why are you complaining if it's a step in the right direction? It's called progress. Be happy. If you're bitter about Trump calling for a ban on bump stocks, you need to take a step back & realize you're a perfect example of the problem. PEOPLE are the problem.
782 2018-02-20 22:59:27 We wouldn't need to ban bump stocks if people didn't have the weapons they're used on in the first place.
783 2018-02-20 22:59:13 WILL someone tell Trump the Bump Stocks did not cause all the killing at the school apparently Trump is out of touch So banning the Bump Stocks is not the Answer the answer Is only police military Can buy those AR-!5's
784 2018-02-20 22:59:13 The 2A allows for regulation - hence why guns are already regulated by the senate. Trump has just today proposed to ban bump stocks. Regulation just needs to be strengthened further. 2A can stay.
785 2018-02-20 22:59:12 How about out of any civilians hands! There is no place for those type of weapons in the hands of anyone other than the military. Banning Bump Stocks is a complete distraction from the really hard stuff.
786 2018-02-20 22:59:09 I think President Trump and these kids should come together and listen and talk. They ARE traumatized and they DO have their feelings. I think this would be the right thing to do. Maybe he can encourage them. He is wanting to make bump stocks illegal. I read that today.
787 2018-02-20 22:59:08 If this is how he worded it in writing, it doesn’t ban bump stocks. 
“I signed a memorandum directing the attorney general to propose regulations to ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns,” Trump said
788 2018-02-20 22:59:06 While I agree with a ban on bump stocks, this ban would not have changed a single school shooting because bump stocks haven’t been used there. Would’ve lowered the body count in Vegas. Trump is trying to make it look like he did something when he didn’t do much.
789 2018-02-20 22:58:59 bump stocks waste ammo if you cant aim dont shoot. pick another activity like crochet
790 2018-02-20 22:58:57 @MrBrianKenny Interesting to see your not thanking the president when he just put forward a hopeful ban on bump stocks. Instead of saying vote them out say this is someone that needs to stay for a full 8 years because of his action on the matter which his predecessor ignored.
791 2018-02-20 22:58:56 I support this and I work in the industry. Bump stocks are gay. AF. The only problem I have is it leaves the door open to ban all kinds of after market accessories like triggers and what not that don’t have any bearing on rate of fire.
792 2018-02-20 22:58:49 People moaning that Trump isn't doing enough about US gun culture and to reduce gun crime... so Trump listens and signs an order banning bump-stocks... People still fucking moan about Trump. The guy can't win. He's still done more good in 13 months than Obama did in eight years.
793 2018-02-20 22:58:48 Geraldo.
Bump-Stocks are irrelevant.
You can kill more people without them because they make aiming much more difficult. I have one.

The GOP must close the "gun show / private sales / internet sales loopholes" in background checks. 
If Trump doesn't do that, it's all BS.
794 2018-02-20 22:58:44 I say keep the bump stocks but do something about the AR-15s.
795 2018-02-20 22:58:32 What Trump signed today is good BUT not near enough!
 Bump stocks gone, NRA gone,
 VOTE THEM OUT! 
796 2018-02-20 22:58:21 Congress has already said they would take action against Bump Stocks after Las Vegas and to date what has been done ?
797 2018-02-20 22:58:20 The problem isn’t guns or bump stocks or bazookas. We need someone with bigs balls and a brain to demonstrate how to look at this issue using logic and objective reasoning instead of emotional hysteria.
798 2018-02-20 22:58:12 It's 2018. 
Online, I can: buy/sell stocks/bitcoin, get a mortgage loans, buy a car, pay bills, order almost anything that ever existed from Amazon, consume all forms of media, run criminal history checks, see news in real-time, get dna results, adopt a child...
I can't: Vote? 
799 2018-02-20 22:58:10 He sent a memo to sessions to propose considering changes. It's not an EO to ban bump stocks. It's a delay tactic. I'm skeptical ....
800 2018-02-20 22:58:00 Bump stocks were not used in FL. So in 5 months he will address the assault weapon used? Will he reinstate restrictions on mentally ill?
801 2018-02-20 22:58:00 so why don't you tweet anything about your proposed ban of bump stocks for guns? maybe you don't want to bring attention that it takes a group of movtivated school kids to force you to make a stand...kids who understand the constitution more than you.
802 2018-02-20 22:57:54 143 days after the Las Vegas massacre, without, as far as we know. applying the results of any study, trump calls for a ban on bump stocks. I'm sure it is a complete and total ban that will last until "we know what the hell is going on." And he will accuse the oppo of politics.
803 2018-02-20 22:57:53 Hey @realDonaldTrump don't you dare cave on bump stocks. It's a slippery slope and haa nothing to do with the Florida shooting. Pass funding for school security and punish the @fbi for incompetence. That's how you fix this problem.
804 2018-02-20 22:57:47 If the #POTUS actually makes bump stocks illegal, I will congratulate him.
805 2018-02-20 22:57:43 Yes,Donald trump just used an executive order to ban all bumps stocks and any modification to increase the rate of fire on any rifle,and yes the AR's and SKS any so called assault rifle,pistol,shotgun are coming next_he flat out lied to the people who got him elected
806 2018-02-20 22:57:42 What does Obama legalizing Bump Stocks have to do with the others? Are you claiming they do?
807 2018-02-20 22:57:39 @realDonaldTrump what’s next after banning bump stocks? Rifle scopes? Because they make you more accurate?
808 2018-02-20 22:57:35 This is just stupid. You know full well if Trump endorses a ban on bump stocks the progressives and SJW types will come out in favor of them.

810 2018-02-20 22:57:21 Even the NRA is cool with banning bump stocks, so this is his biggest non-news news today.
811 2018-02-20 22:57:17 The legal mechanism that is likely to be used for bump stocks can in no way, shape, or form be valid to ban AR-15s or similar rifles. So, from a legal standpoint, it would be a huge step
812 2018-02-20 22:57:06 Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this AFTER they voted to allow bump stocks - just AFTER Las Vegas???
813 2018-02-20 22:57:01 Lotus working on 1st step by prohibiting bump stocks. That's progress. You? Chatted? Did u get the air conditioned bus?
814 2018-02-20 22:56:53 I will give @realDonaldTrump credit when it's due. Thank you for beginning gun control.  Even if it's being done to deflect from Russia Scandal...it's good for the USA.
Background check
No bumper stocks!
Good start
815 2018-02-20 22:56:48 Meanwhile receiving funding from the NRA. How about banning the weapons that bump stocks go on? That’s the catalyst.
816 2018-02-20 22:56:46 Bump stocks about to sell out
817 2018-02-20 22:56:41 Not enough. If it passes, will drop the discussion. NRA doesn't care about bump stocks.
818 2018-02-20 22:56:41 Regardless of how you characterize it, he failed to do enough in regards to bump stocks.
819 2018-02-20 22:56:38 Bump stocks only are insufficient here.
820 2018-02-20 22:56:35 Stocks trade based on three things: sentiment, valuation and trend. --Josh Brown
821 2018-02-20 22:56:27 You banning bump stocks , you just lost my support. I know Pence wouldn't cave so I’ll be staying home during the midterms. Have fun with the impeachment.
822 2018-02-20 22:56:27 Because bump stocks do not, in fact, turn semi-automatic weapons into “machine guns” (which per 1986 law, are illegal to manufacture or sell/buy new versions of).
823 2018-02-20 22:56:26 Now he wants a ban on bump stocks?. Cudnt bring himself to do it after Vegas but bcos little children r kicking his ass he does it for political reasons. Wat a pig @AidenWolfe
824 2018-02-20 22:56:24 Bump Stocks ahh yeah those things. Smh. Hey Mr  you’re kind of late on that one.
825 2018-02-20 22:56:24 Its just more of Trump's BS. 
 The ATF already admitted it lacks the authority to ban bump stocks, leaving the door open for litigation that could last years. 
It would require an EO. Lets see if he has the balls to do it.
I say he is too weak.
826 2018-02-20 22:56:21 After Parkland:

Libs: "DO SOMETHING" "DO SOMETHING"

In the news today:
"Trump has asked Attorney General Sessions to propose a ban on bump stocks"

Libs: "I'll believe it when I see it" "Too little too late"

#LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
#bumpstocks
827 2018-02-20 22:56:19 @MrColionNoir what are your feelings on @realDonaldTrump proposing a ban on bump stocks that is allegedly backed by the @NRA ?
828 2018-02-20 22:56:18 Bump stocks weren’t used in this crime. They should have never been allowed in the first place, that ones on obama.
829 2018-02-20 22:56:09 @realDonaldTrump bump stocks were used once in a shooting. Mentally deranged people where used 100% of the time.
830 2018-02-20 22:56:08 Any ban on bump stocks, accessories, hi capacity mags, and AR's will help end bodies, lives and families from being torn apart.  If you truly believe that gun ownership and carry makes communities safer, the USA would be the safest country on the planet, yet we are not. #NRAKills
831 2018-02-20 22:56:05 Trump just called for the ban of bump stocks. Conservatives will argue they've been against them all along in 3... 2...
832 2018-02-20 22:56:00 I hope everyone realizes this is a stunt by @realDonaldTrump! All he is doing is sending memo to Jeff Sessions asking for possible regulations on “bump stocks”! If he were serious he would have said he is demanding Congress right now draw up & deliver a law banning them!
833 2018-02-20 22:56:00 Bump stocks are novelty items.
834 2018-02-20 22:55:46 @DonaldJTrumpJr Who is advising @realDonaldTrump on bumpfire stocks and other mods?  He just tossed 2020 out the window.
835 2018-02-20 22:55:40 Prediction: In an attempt to distract and look responsive, republicans will follow Trump’s lead and finally get around to banning bump stocks. Which weren’t used at the #ParklandShooting
836 2018-02-20 22:55:40 But bump stocks never killed anyone......
837 2018-02-20 22:55:38 It’s my understanding that the AG cannot ban bump stocks. A law is required. What say you?
838 2018-02-20 22:55:35 Hi!

Trump said he recommended a law restricting devices that turn semis into autos.

We already have one. Bump stocks don't do that. He might as well have said nothing. Stop praising him for his shitty smokescreen.
839 2018-02-20 22:55:34 There wasn’t any legal pathway to ban bump stocks for Obama, and there really isn’t one for Trump either.
840 2018-02-20 22:55:34 Yeah and very few mass shootings use bump stocks.
841 2018-02-20 22:55:32 @realDonaldTrump .. Mr. PRESIDENT I am seriously disappointed on your statement regarding bump stocks and entertaining any gun control.  No compromise sir.
842 2018-02-20 22:55:28 Stocks making the biggest moves after hours: LendingClub, Boyd Gaming, Texas Roadhouse & more...
843 2018-02-20 22:55:24 If Trump really gave a damn about gun control he'd have proposed banning bump stocks 4 1/2 months ago after Las Vegas.  Period.
844 2018-02-20 22:55:16 Amazing how Trump came up with some ideas about guns after a top Trump donor stated he will no longer write checks to any politician accepting money from the NRA.  Outlawing Bump fire stocks is a start, but I'm guessing not many of those are used when you can just go buy an AR-15
845 2018-02-20 22:55:14 THREAD: So the President has aske Attorney General Jeff Sessions to propose a ban on bump stocks. Let's talk about that.
846 2018-02-20 22:55:12 Obama is going to be mad. I mean it was his administration that approved the bump stocks
847 2018-02-20 22:55:12 OK fine, I'll outlaw bump-stocks, but the son-in-law stays! #TrumpColluded
848 2018-02-20 22:55:04 My gut tells me this ban on bump stocks will be in exchange for push to arm school staff to keep NRA happy.  They will make lots if that is legislated and are counting on a run on purchasing bump stocks before they are officially banned.  Gun profits is always the driving force.
849 2018-02-20 22:55:00 @realDonaldTrump was slurring his speech and spoke haltingly today when they propped him up to say something about bump stocks. Is his condition deteriorating? What's up? @chrislhayes @maddow @AriMelber @KatyTurNBC ?????
850 2018-02-20 22:54:56 Of course he didn’t. Banning bump stocks is not a bad idea, but it’s a little like building a wall on the Mexican border to keep out Muslim immigrants.
851 2018-02-20 22:54:55 UNLESS YOU BAN AUTOMANIC WEAPONS GETTING RID OF BUMP STOCKS WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING!
852 2018-02-20 22:54:53 So according to Senator Feinstein, the ATF sent a letter to Congress in 2013 notifying them that the ATF has no jurisdiction over bump stocks, which do not qualify as a firearm. In other words, you have to pass a law and good luck with that.
853 2018-02-20 22:54:49 Actually, it was a determination by the ATF that bump stocks are “a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act." They were never illegal. So the law needs to change in order to outlaw their sales.
854 2018-02-20 22:54:48 thoughts and prayers on losing bump stocks.
855 2018-02-20 22:54:47 #BREAKING: President Trump has directed the Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks, which were used in the Las Vegas massacre.
856 2018-02-20 22:54:41 There is no need to ban bump stocks. The ATF could regulate them as a NFA item, which requires a much stricter background check, fingerprints, approval your local Sheriff/Chief of Police (depending on  where you live, as some states do not require the approval) + a Tax Stamp Fee.
857 2018-02-20 22:54:40 3b.High capacity magazines are a convenience and don't really make a difference. In aimed fire, someone shooting an M1 Garand can keep up with someone shooting an AR.
3c. Bump stocks, and accessories that do the same function can be easily replicated at home.
858 2018-02-20 22:54:36 And? Do they carry AR 15s with bump stocks? Shaddap foo. So do most elected officials.
859 2018-02-20 22:54:33 I would rather look at stocks all day then go to work 
860 2018-02-20 22:54:30 So Trump issued an Executive Order banning bump stocks. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day. Or, he checked with his masters at the NRA, who told him this was a good way to get the heat off them and the GOP, in view of the Parkland survivors activism.
861 2018-02-20 22:54:25 I heard Trump say he was banning bump stocks,that they turned rifles into machine guns,.That sounds like something #gunsense would say,smh.
862 2018-02-20 22:54:21 And how many school shootings have been done with bump stocks?
863 2018-02-20 22:54:20 Bump stocks weren’t used in this crime. They should have never been allowed in the first place. Pretty sure that’s on obama.
864 2018-02-20 22:54:07 Eliminate bump stocks , shore up the background check system, raise age to buy semi auto rifles.  All would be acceptable to any 2 A folks like me
865 2018-02-20 22:54:06 @realDonaldTrump proposes a “rule” against bump stocks so Congress does not have to vote on it.  Sounds like enabling the swamp not draining it.  Sad.  #never again
866 2018-02-20 22:54:02 ya know I dont really like Trump like at all but him banning or trying to ban bump stocks is a good idea. highly unnecessary and were used in multiple shootings.
867 2018-02-20 22:54:01 What is wrong with our President? It took him over five months to ask justice department to change rules on Bump stocks. I guess it will take another six months to ask ban on sale of AR 15. Another sick entity is Florida Legislature. They can not even debate assault weapons ban.
868 2018-02-20 22:53:59 @realDonaldTrump by banning bump stocks, you have shown you have no concept of what any side wants to protect people
869 2018-02-20 22:53:56 Trump really boutta ban bump stocks wow
870 2018-02-20 22:53:54 Let's be honest, banning bump stocks is not even a drop in the fucking pond. Neither is increased background checks. If we want this to stop, we need a buy back program, and a way to confiscate weapons that are illegally obtained or loosely in circulation.
871 2018-02-20 22:53:50 Lots of GREAT buying opportunities out there right NOW! Weed stocks to rally a few more times before legalization! Following $ACB $BLGV $WEED $EAT $THCX $LG.V $EMH $ISOL $$$
872 2018-02-20 22:53:47 @realDonaldTrump approving the ban of bump stocks is something I'm shocked but pleased to hear about.
873 2018-02-20 22:53:47 There should be a sign out front the ER that say “in pain? Don’t bother...all you need to do is go home and take Tylenol....then call me in the morning and tell me how my stocks are doing! It’s all good and Pain won’t kill you!” #dontpayERtheydidnttreatyourpain
874 2018-02-20 22:53:45 Can the AG just ban bump stocks? Or is he just looking into the legality of them? And if they are legal then what? Pass a law? Good luck with that. And if they are illegal what happens to all of them that are there? Will they be confiscated or grandfathered?
875 2018-02-20 22:53:37 Funny, but it is a gif of bump stocks. They work like that and are dumb gimicky things. You have to push the barrel with one arm and pull the pistol grip with the other. When the trigger gets "pulled" it recoils back far enough to reset the action. Was that explanation clear ish?
876 2018-02-20 22:53:37 Personally idaf about Obama's poison pill gimmicky 'bump stocks' but the solution isn't gun grabbing in ANY form it is to REIGN IN THE CORRUPT DEEP STATE. Diverting to leftist pandering is weak, and a mistake, and it sends the message that they can now kill children for more.
877 2018-02-20 22:53:34 Bump stocks or Donald Trump sucks?
878 2018-02-20 22:53:31 You mean the bump stocks that the Obama administration approved?
879 2018-02-20 22:53:30 As a gun owner and CCL holder, I gotta say, if you’re fighting for bump stocks, you’re doing it wrong. Go to the range and work on your trigger control instead.
880 2018-02-20 22:53:29 this is why Trump's "memo" today is in bad faith.  Anyone with access to Google knows that the relevant department officials say they can't ban bump stocks w/o a new law, and yet Trump just ignores it and tells Sessions to find a way to make it seem like he's taking action.
881 2018-02-20 22:53:21 Do To ban "bump stocks" make you safer? Maybe to solve the problem you must avoid that a seventeen turns reinforced. 
Second amendement is part of the American culture but maybe it's time to change, a little bit.
882 2018-02-20 22:53:19 Bump stocks were never illegal...so says the Obama administration when they greenlighted the sale of bump stocks.
883 2018-02-20 22:53:16 Whoda THUNK it would take 75 people to be mowed down & slaughtered by AR-15 to get DOOFUS DICK-TATOR tot #ToddlerInChief-in-chief (along w/roughly 600 along   injured) TO ACTUALLY BAN "BUMP STOCKS" & any item that turns any gun into a "basically a machine gun)djt
884 2018-02-20 22:53:13 Oh I wouldn’t be surprised if the @NRA swallowed this pill. Before Vegas, bump stocks weren’t popular anyway, so they’ll take the punch and look like they’ve compromised. They lose nothing.
885 2018-02-20 22:53:10 Awesome, I'll bet their stocks are gonna soar after this.
886 2018-02-20 22:53:07 Before you go further down this road, @CNN, see Dianne Feinstein's comments on the ATF regulating bump stocks.
887 2018-02-20 22:53:06 Loooooooove that bump stocks are NOW the right's sacrificial lamb...you dumb motherfuckers, that was like 6 mass shootings ago, and we'll remember that in November.  #NeverAgain #KillTheNRA
888 2018-02-20 22:53:04 Nope, neither gat cranks or bump stocks are illegal. Bump stocks for semi auto rifles, gat cranks for pistols. Still legal. I've see them at gun shows. In fact after Vegas the mfg of both were sold out. hoe sick is that
889 2018-02-20 22:52:55 Even the biggest gun advocates I know support banning bump stocks. Trump's executive action should not be controversial.
890 2018-02-20 22:52:52 I'm a reasonable person, a couple of hours in the stocks will be fine.
891 2018-02-20 22:52:43 Can the AG just ban bump stocks? Or is he just looking into the legality of them? And if they are legal then what? And if they are illegal what happens to all that are there? Will they be confiscated or grandfathered?
892 2018-02-20 22:52:43 I actually read he is directing the attorney general to start implementing bans on bump stocks. In the article I read he has already looked into it in response to Las Vegas.
893 2018-02-20 22:52:42 I don't even think the NRA cares if bump stocks get banned. Quick win for Trump. More than Obama did.
894 2018-02-20 22:52:42 No need for a selector switch when bump stocks can make it full auto. Just remember the classification ASSAULT rifle. Not classified as sport rifle or hunting. This weapon is highly desirable because it is easy to modify to make auto. Your use may be good intent.
895 2018-02-20 22:52:36 Lower open likely or early selling. Would wait drying up pattern.  Stay with growth stocks.
896 2018-02-20 22:52:36 But we banned machine guns too, deciding that military grade weapons are just too powerful. And from what I understand, bump stocks essentially turn a semi automatic into an automatic.
897 2018-02-20 22:52:33 Oh I see you were also stupid enough to claim I said “no one will use bump stocks if you ban them”.   This is exactly the nonsense I was telling you about.  Act like you’ve won a legitimate debate before 
898 2018-02-20 22:52:24 But Bump Stocks don't kill people, people kill people.
The only thing that stops a bad guy w/ a bump stock is a good guy w/ a bump stock
I'll give you my bump stock when you take it from my cold, dead hands
899 2018-02-20 22:52:24 Trump stocks
900 2018-02-20 22:52:22 Trump is banning bump stocks? Oh boy. This should be interesting.
901 2018-02-20 22:52:10 If @realDonaldTrump can outlaw bumpstocks, without legislation, he must be able to outlaw military grade weapons! If he really wants to make it safer for children to go to school, he would.  He got permission from the NRA who owns him, on the bump stocks! He cannot act w/o NRA!
902 2018-02-20 22:52:06 Bump stocks? We should have banned those back in October.
903 2018-02-20 22:52:03 Are you watching the news? Fox just announced the President has directed the DOJ to draft a rule to ban bump stocks.  Lets hear you compliment the President for that, can we?
904 2018-02-20 22:51:54 Bump stocks.. not widely used, most gun enthusiasts think they’re garbage.. it’s a simple contraption that can be 3D printed.  This is an empty gesture he hopes will distract the masses.
905 2018-02-20 22:51:49 Bump stocks still suck
906 2018-02-20 22:51:47 Does this mean the value of bump stocks will be 10 fold in a few years? I'm sure some FUDD is cashing in as I type this! #BanAssaultWeapons
907 2018-02-20 22:51:43 But Bump Stocks don't kill people, people kill people.
The only thing that stops a bad guy w/ a bump stock is a good guy w/ a bump stock
I'll give you my bump stock when you take it from my cold, dead hands
908 2018-02-20 22:51:41 How does decimating the environment protect our children? Please. And getting rid of bump stocks? No one really needs them who is a civilian. How many mass shootings were they included in? Big deal.
909 2018-02-20 22:51:32 Putting all these lies on your page and go to change the truth because people do not support that tax cut people are not getting bonuses like that you're the corporations yeah the bosses but that buy more stocks don't fuc #ReleaseTheDemMemo
910 2018-02-20 22:51:30 It appears a2 Milk $A2M has simply done it again... no hiding from obvious quality + momentum, it appears... #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities
911 2018-02-20 22:51:29 I just figured out this was done already. Bump stocks prohibited. EO is useless bluster.
912 2018-02-20 22:51:18 Call me a cynical arsehole but Trump making the announcement on bumb stocks just seems like a way to deflect from the gun control debate going on  post Florida, by talking about bump stocks they can say they are talking about gun control but not really
913 2018-02-20 22:51:16 Were bump stocks even used in Florida?
914 2018-02-20 22:51:05 It is a little late to say "ban bump stocks"
915 2018-02-20 22:50:57 The ATF told Congress that it does not have the authority to Regulate Bump Stocks.

Trump's first significant piece of legislation was a CAR bill designed to allow Adjudicated Mentally Disabled people to purchase guns.

This is for show, and you know it.
916 2018-02-20 22:50:35 Trump: "we will ban bump stocks"

Sane people: "well, that's not even enough to start resolving this issue..."

Pro-gun people: "see? These libtards are never happy!"
917 2018-02-20 22:50:27 Why not be logical and still have “our guns and shoot them too”? Seems to me we need to ban/limit bump stocks. Can’t buy certain weapons up to a certain caliber until a certain age (21 possibly); limit/ban magazines above certain amount of rounds. Can’t be all or nothing.
918 2018-02-20 22:50:25 Ya because so many bump stocks are used for mass murders. Be proud you did absolutely nothing to curb a whacko from shooting people.
919 2018-02-20 22:50:25 Oh come on!!   Ban the semi automatic rifles and bump stocks will Be IRRELEVANT. No more@half measures....ridiculous Joe sucking up to that orange buffoon.
920 2018-02-20 22:50:25 Nothing new. Republican said they were going to ban Bump Stocks after the Vegas shooting, but they were too cowardly to do it.
921 2018-02-20 22:50:22 It's not bump stocks it's a bump on the head. Crazies are the weak people that kill.
922 2018-02-20 22:50:11 .@realDonaldTrump “Take a look at bump stocks, Jeff” what a crock of horseshit this is. No one needs to take any looks. Just outlaw them and then the assault weapons they enhance.

The world knows you love pussy. Stop being one.

#BanAssaultWeaponsNow
923 2018-02-20 22:50:08 Liberals will criticize him any way, but I think is ok. Banning bump stocks don’t limit my rights.#2A
924 2018-02-20 22:50:07 Bump stocks? Or Donald Trump sucks?
925 2018-02-20 22:49:59 One ban/law get rid of bump stocks.  They make the AR15 automatic.  Those kids are organizing themselves and so what if it is the democrats.  Something needs to change.  Lets start the dialogue.
926 2018-02-20 22:49:57 Not all the mentally ill are dangerous. Anyway, Trump directed Sessions to see if bump stocks are illegal. He didn't direct Sessions to ban them. Sessions could find that the aren't illegal, therefore, they may not be banned afterall.
927 2018-02-20 22:49:57 Let we the people vote!  I guarantee bump stocks will be banned tomorrow.  Throw in body armor and clips over 10 rounds too. We the people are helpless unless we are given something to vote on!!!
928 2018-02-20 22:49:52 Bump stocks?
929 2018-02-20 22:49:49 "Low hanging fruit" Even the NRA believes bump stocks should be banned.
930 2018-02-20 22:49:48 The bone @RealDonaldTrump is trying to throw to the survivors of the #ParklandKids is 'bump stocks', but #GOP legislators won't pass that either.
931 2018-02-20 22:49:43 Although bump stocks were not used on the AR 15 in this mass shooting, it’s still a good decision by @realDonaldTrump to ban them today
932 2018-02-20 22:49:42 trump ordered a ban on bump stocks????
933 2018-02-20 22:49:41 .@realDonaldTrump signed a memo directed the DOJ to propose new regulations banning bump stocks. Translation: Trump is under fire to DO SOMETHING and this is the very least thing he can do without angering the .@NRA and of course this doesn't mean anything will actually be done
934 2018-02-20 22:49:35 How about banning AR-15 rifles. I am not impressed with him looking into banning bump stocks
935 2018-02-20 22:49:28 1) Trump says people who don’t clap for him are treasonous 2) Trump wants to ban bump stocks 3) Trump is breaking up American citizens’ families via deportation 4) Ivanka and Jared, anyone??
936 2018-02-20 22:49:26 Trump is #soangrywithrussia he wants Putin to ban bump stocks too.
937 2018-02-20 22:49:23 Banning bump stocks is going to save almost all of the 33,000 lives lost from gun violence in the United States each year.

Right!
938 2018-02-20 22:49:22 Trump tells Sessions to “work on” a ban on bump stocks. This is progress, but it has nothing to do with the Florida school shooting. The NRA will allow this to move on, but no further. They will not tolerate action on banning semi-automatic weapons. #NoBalls
939 2018-02-20 22:49:09 @realDonaldTrump Banning bump stocks will not change anything. Giving in to the Democrats is an awful idea. Also imposing age limits is a waste of time. Allow Americans 17 and older to carry at all times...schools, theaters, church, you name it...this crap won't happen as much
940 2018-02-20 22:48:52 Because the guys on the board of the NRA don’t make a dime from bump stocks.  It’s an add-on.  NRA only cares about guns and ammo.  They gave Trump the bump stock to throw a bone to appease gun control advocates.  They won’t get away with it
941 2018-02-20 22:48:52 @realDonaldTrump If you ban bump stocks you will not get re-elected. Trust me... I’m one of your strongest supporters. Don’t cave to the Democrats. If you do this, you will lose your base... guaranteed.
942 2018-02-20 22:48:50 some random npc in kingdom come that i just helped: nice talking to you :)
same npc, seconds later: *walks right into me* how DARE YOU TOUCH ME. the AUDACITY, you filthy PEASANT, see you in the stocks lmfao
943 2018-02-20 22:48:48 If I had knew to invest in bitcoins and stocks n shit when I was up cause mane now I would really be sitting pretty
944 2018-02-20 22:48:48 They don't want there prison stocks too drop. Very profitable business to be in.
945 2018-02-20 22:48:40 See here I'm reading your tweets thinking you have a few good points then you go nuts and blame Obama for bump stocks. Is Obama to blame for 9/11 and Katrina also?
946 2018-02-20 22:48:38 Hey you americans, you do have a serious problem. Bump stocks discussion after another massacre? We would not even know the dutch translation of it or it s meaning
947 2018-02-20 22:48:35 Bump stocks not enough Trump!!!      Worthless !
948 2018-02-20 22:48:31 Sum this up...BAN ALL MAGAZINE AND BUMP STOCKS!!!!!
949 2018-02-20 22:48:28 Not even close to sufficient. You had a chance to help ban bump stocks in Oct 17. Doing so now just shows how little you cared then; and are only reacting now because the heat’s on, with as little as you can possibly get away with. So cowardly.
950 2018-02-20 22:48:21 Also signed a motion to ban bump stocks
951 2018-02-20 22:48:16 #Trump's order to ban bump stocks is merely a distraction to avoid more significant #GunReform such as banning the AR-15 altogether.
952 2018-02-20 22:48:09 Bump stocks  were originally intended for people with disabilities to be able to fire a weapon such as the AR-15. Unfortunately gun enthusiasts turned it in to a way where you can practically fire full auto without modifying the internals of the weapon (which is illegal).
953 2018-02-20 22:48:09 Trump, making bump stocks illegal isn’t gun control. Do something about it because this time the argument isn’t going away! Your lack of class never ceases to amaze! #guncontrol #GunContolNow #trump #ImpeachTrump
954 2018-02-20 22:48:01 @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump 
Bump stocks r a bone 4 protestors. Domestic abusers should not ever have any gun, and assault weapons 4 none.
955 2018-02-20 22:47:43 Banning bump stocks is ridiculous and won't solve anything. Next it will be mags. That's what they're really after.
956 2018-02-20 22:47:38 [Reuters]
RT ReutersUS: BREAKING: Trump says he has signed a memorandum recommending that bump stocks - like those used in Las Vegas shooting - be d…
957 2018-02-20 22:47:38 So, the fraud we have as a president now wants to write regulations banning bump stocks. I think he should first hold a “listening session” for the families of the victims killed & injured by the bump stock shooter in Las  Vegas. You’re just going after bump stocks now? You fool!
958 2018-02-20 22:47:38 News: "Trump moves to ban 'bump stocks'"

@NRA/#2A: "ANOTHER restriction? Where will it end?"

Murdered teenagers:
959 2018-02-20 22:47:32 The reason it took a few months is because he didn't want it to be a knee-jerk reaction. He conducted a study involving the use of bump stocks and concluded that they were deserving of a ban.
960 2018-02-20 22:47:32 The president deserves thanks for taking an important first step on gun safety laws by directing the AG to ban bump stocks. Let’s hope expanded background checks are next so we can keep military-style guns out of the hands of terrorists, domestic abusers and the mentally ill.
961 2018-02-20 22:47:30 If @realDonaldTrump really cared (hint: he doesn’t) he would sign an EO immediately suspending the sale of bump stocks while DOJ reviews legislation outlawing them. No one would be irreparably harmed and hundreds of thousands wouldn’t be purchased in the interim. #NeverAgain
962 2018-02-20 22:47:29 Adulting. Stocks and iniisip buong shift. 
963 2018-02-20 22:47:26 But they're out there already. Sen Feinstein (D-CA) pushed for the ban last year. But the kids & teachers were shot with AR-15 & there is still concealed carry into states that ban it & issuance of guns to people with mental & emotional instability. It's not enough. "Bump Stocks"
964 2018-02-20 22:47:25 If they r banned you can’t buy them at a gun show!!  The NRA has supported a ban on bump stocks for years. Not sure where the black market is.
965 2018-02-20 22:47:23 And yet he didn't do anything regarding gun control. On the other hand President Trump just made illegal to buy bump stocks for the AR-15 rifles. Wait isn't a vigil in the same lines as thoughts and prayers? I thought you were against those kind of things.
966 2018-02-20 22:47:22 What part of the curve?  Latest run in stocks is nearly 90% correlated with reduction in 10yr tsy
967 2018-02-20 22:47:12 What he signed isn't worth the paper it's written on.  He can't order Sessions to do anything.  Only Congress can pass the bill making the bump stocks illegal.
968 2018-02-20 22:47:10 Banning bump stocks is a great first step but it has virtually no financial impact on gun manufacturers. What about universal registration? Universal background checks including gun show and second hand sales? Banning military assault weapons? (cont.)
969 2018-02-20 22:47:00 irony

Liberals: "TRUMP CANT RULE BY X.ORDER"
same Liberals "DAMMIT TRUMP, BAN 'BUMP STOCKS' BY X.ORDER"

guess based on these #NewRules
Trump CAN end DACA by x.order
and kill Klownkare too

#LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
#MyRightsTrumpYourFeelz
970 2018-02-20 22:46:57 I don’t care about the bump stocks but I do care about caving. I can  replicate a bump stock on an ar just by firing rapidly. 

This won’t Do anything for the left and they will keep screaming. Meanwhile, we don’t get anything like firing the idiots at the fbi or guards
971 2018-02-20 22:46:52 Why all the hoopla over banning bump stocks? A bump stock, in and of itself, is not a weapon; therefore, the banning of it would not violate the second amendment, correct? Or am I missing something? Why do your really need one of these?
972 2018-02-20 22:46:48 If true, only 5 months (Vegas massacre) to research whether bump stocks were legal. Now they WILL be illegal (maybe-fine print counts). Now, let's close gun show loopholes, standardized BG checks (no-fly list,armed crimes,DV,stalking, mental/public threat), and ban assault rifles
973 2018-02-20 22:46:48 So people were screaming for @realDonaldTrump to ban bump stocks. He does and now those same people are criticizing him for doing so. "Not necessary, not how they work, not important, etc". Do you hear how dumb that sounds?
974 2018-02-20 22:46:45 @NRA are the terror lobbyists. Ban assault weapons high capacity magazines, bump stocks, suppressors. Outlaw #NRA. Regulate/license existing guns. Make America Safe Again. #MASA
975 2018-02-20 22:46:44 Not enough, just talking about bump stocks. That was “supposed” to be voted on after Vegas. After the thoughts and prayers nothing happened
976 2018-02-20 22:46:41 Tried to invest in in stocks without even researching it and lost it all lol biggest idiot
977 2018-02-20 22:46:40 Trump is trying to get bump stocks banned now. Might as well ban loops on pants because there are so many ways to "bump fire" weapons. It's fucking ridiculous!
978 2018-02-20 22:46:39 Wouldn't be possible and SHOULDNT happen as it would infringe 2nd rights. Banning AR-15's, cranks, bump stocks and the like, I believe won't infringe 2nd.
979 2018-02-20 22:46:36 Bump stocks where made for people like me, arthritis
980 2018-02-20 22:46:33 We need to ask our President not to ban bump stocks for our guns!!!
981 2018-02-20 22:46:25 Our if their precious bump stocks were turned on them? "Well it is his right to own this device that makes his weapon fully automatic... oh well ."
982 2018-02-20 22:46:23 Trump Tells DOJ To Ban Bump Stocks...
"...and replace them with my new TrumpBump Stocks®, just $399, and ideal for taking out an entire middle school!"
983 2018-02-20 22:46:23 thanks for the response. Should I be concerned about current stocks I have? Thank goodness you also do Earl Grey !
984 2018-02-20 22:46:22 ATF has been arguing that current law doesn't give ATF the authority to ban bump stocks. Is Trump proposing a regulation he knows a court will strike down? The NRA would approve of that.
985 2018-02-20 22:46:16 Banning bump stocks is no more than a drop in the bucket.  Man up Trump!
986 2018-02-20 22:46:08 See which stocks are posting big moves after the bell.
987 2018-02-20 22:46:08 Finally #Trumpler does something right. Calling for a Ban on Bump stocks. Good on him. First time I can say I agree with him. More good, less gross. #Resist
988 2018-02-20 22:46:07 That's not what bump stocks do. You should really educate yourself...
989 2018-02-20 22:46:01 This would have seemed more sincere, and relevant, if he'd done it after the shooting in Vegas, that actually involved bump stocks.
990 2018-02-20 22:45:55 Our POTUS,just minutes ago,directed the D.O.J to ban bump stocks and modifications to increase rate of fire on any rifle,the same who we got elected because of the 2A,HE JUST LOST MY VOTE
991 2018-02-20 22:45:54 Trump banning bump stocks is an admission that gun laws can make a difference. Will he realize this? Hell no.
992 2018-02-20 22:45:51 Banning bump stocks is a sad excuse of a solution. We want GUN CONTROL NOW. Congress and the Trump administration need to work together to make legitimate solutions. This is not enough to stop the slaughter of innocent children. We need real solutions now.
993 2018-02-20 22:45:51 News: "Trump moves to ban 'bump stocks'"

#2A: "ANOTHER restriction? Where will it end?"

Murdered children:
994 2018-02-20 22:45:51 Band bump stocks?!? That's like putting a bandage on a gunshot wound.
995 2018-02-20 22:45:47 He's talking about bump stocks, etc.
996 2018-02-20 22:45:46 Trump and Congress don't want to outlaw bump stocks so he orders AG Sessions to come up with a rule against them. Chicken shit Trump and Republicans.  @realDonaldTrump
997 2018-02-20 22:45:39 FAKE PREZ & PRACTICED DRAMA QUEEN: Such drama displayed in reading scripted plan to "ban" bump stocks. Learn the difference between a "regulation" & LAW. A reg needs the force of LAW behind it to make it enforceable. Regs alone or w/o a basis in LAW solve nothing. BS from a POS?
998 2018-02-20 22:45:29 Their talking about Bump-Stocks which I agree nobody needs such a thing, and it’s not a gun
999 2018-02-20 22:45:23 Something tells me that he's just deflecting due to other administration problems and probably won't go through with banning 'bump stocks.'  I guess it depends upon who he speaks to last. Hopefully, the person he speaks to last tells him to ban 'bump stocks.' Le sigh 
1000 2018-02-20 22:45:16 Oh yeah, he must be forgetting that part of the Constitution that addresses bump stocks. 

And PS - Which well-regulated militia do you belong to?
1001 2018-02-20 22:45:14 @realDonaldTrump Sends directive to DOJ to ban bump stocks.
#FakePOTUS does the ABSOLUTE minimum. Should have been done MONTHS ago.

#BanAR15 #BanAssaultWeaponsNow
1002 2018-02-20 22:45:13 No need to ban bump stocks. .
Just break them..
They suck
1003 2018-02-20 22:45:02 Whatta laff!!!! Absolutely no help at all!! None of the school shooters had bump stocks!
1004 2018-02-20 22:44:59 Now trump all of sudden supports banning bump stocks lol, that’s only to take attention away from banning assault weapons and having stricter background checks
1005 2018-02-20 22:44:55 No day is too late to make change happen. Congratulations @POTUS on banning bump stocks to make our kids a little safer.
1006 2018-02-20 22:44:52 Apparently, since it took so long to make bump stocks illegal, this is a token move to check the box for doing something common sense for preventing one gun from doing so much killing. I can only hope more serious legislation will come soon. NRA money will still rule, though.
1007 2018-02-20 22:44:34 Today's sign of the Apocalypse! Trump orders DOJ to draw up regulations for bump stocks that allow semiautomatic weapons to act similar to automatic weapons. I suppose it's like saying only Nixon could go to China.
1008 2018-02-20 22:44:31 Hi Clare! We do stock our curves range in stores. If you can follow us and DM your postcode I can find out the nearest store that stocks this for you. Thanks! #NLApril
1009 2018-02-20 22:44:27 Trump is banning bump stocks? That's a good thing. Thank you.
1010 2018-02-20 22:44:26 This should not have 2b.There should b a by partisan bill in congress 2 ban AR 15’s &bump stocks(no other guns)Those who have them now must prove they r securely lock up at all times.if you wish 2 turn them in do so.There should b a committee 2 work on handling mental illness!
1011 2018-02-20 22:44:17 A ban on "Bump Stocks"
is not enough. We demand a ban on all Weapons of War. They belong on a wartime battlefield, not on Main Street, Everytown, USA ! #BanAssaultWeapons
1012 2018-02-20 22:44:16 Wrong they NRA has supported a ban on bump stocks for years. But nice try
1013 2018-02-20 22:44:10 @realDonaldTrump a memo banning bump stocks because they make legal guns operate like automatic weapons seems like you are implying that the function of the automatic weapons is wrong.

It is wrong, Don, go with it.
1014 2018-02-20 22:44:07 Who legalized bump stocks again? Oh right, that would be @BarackObama!
1015 2018-02-20 22:44:07 @TheFive Juan does not even know what the NRA is. It is a gun club with 4.5 million members. They banned bump stocks years ago. Maybe it is not possible to find smart informed left thing host.
1016 2018-02-20 22:44:05 You are right. Much more than just bump stocks needs to be done. 
1017 2018-02-20 22:43:56 Bump stocks are novelty items. Banning them is stupid and won't do anything to prevent violence. On the other hand, because they are novelty I could care less. This ban will effectively do nothing.
1018 2018-02-20 22:43:52 This is precisely why many people oppose #GunControl at all levels; It never ends. After bump stocks are banned,  what will you demand after that?
1019 2018-02-20 22:43:48 Banning bump stocks is just an attempt to appease us. That isn't good enough.
1020 2018-02-20 22:43:46 These teens are terrified -so are the kids at my local schools, so it’s not just a FL concern. Ways to compromise & save 2A? Tighten gun show loopholes, Rubio’s emergency method to temp remove guns from mentally ill/dangerous ppl, give up the bump stocks & I think ppl should...
1021 2018-02-20 22:43:38 Bump stocks are ridiculous but I don't agree with this move.
1022 2018-02-20 22:43:28 Hello, I own guns and I support the second amendment. I also support sensible gun reforms. NO ONE needs an AR15, it is a weapon of war. Then there are bump stocks which turn AR15's and other guns into automatic weapons. Maybe your child will be the next statistic, I hope not.
1023 2018-02-20 22:43:25 Really? Because of the corporate and crony tax cuts? You realize the stocks have been on an upward trend for the last 10 years, right? Also, you realize that the stocks just fell dramatically, right?
1024 2018-02-20 22:43:19 I don’t think most 2A proponents have an issue with banning bump stocks and gat cranks—they’re more of a novelty than anything. However, they’ve also been implicated in a grand total of 1 mass shooting to date, with no clear evidence it increased the death toll.
1025 2018-02-20 22:43:19 Banning bump stocks had better be just the beginning too many changes to come.
1026 2018-02-20 22:43:16 Breaking: Trump is going to take steps to ban bump stocks

What's the smallest and least significant step I can take to make it look like I'm doing something?????

We need more than this. 

#BanAssaultWeapons #BanAssaultWeaponsNow #BanAssaultRifles #bumpstocks #resist #resistance
1027 2018-02-20 22:43:12 I have a question for you Fanny,which I never understand myself,why stocks like AMZN,why don’t they split ever?
1028 2018-02-20 22:43:07 #Trump urges ban on gun devices like bump stocks
1029 2018-02-20 22:42:59 Trump directs Justice Department to ban bump stocks after Las Vegas massacre
1030 2018-02-20 22:42:56 What'll be interesting is if they ban the mod kits and not the stocks

Like, what's the point of that, which manufacturer would rather sell the stocks than the kits given the price points
1031 2018-02-20 22:42:49 banning bump stocks as a response to the shootings is like taking aspirin for a brain tumor
1032 2018-02-20 22:42:43 Needless to say, if a pro-gun regulation liberal wrote that bump stocks "turn weapons into machineguns," we'd be bombarded with criticism that we don't even know how guns work, don't know the definition of a machine gun, and aren't remotely qualified to have opinions
1033 2018-02-20 22:42:41 And the gun stocks go up..what stupid and heartless people..lusting after the world's deadliest small arms
1034 2018-02-20 22:42:41 U.S. stocks retreated after advancing six consecutive days. The Dow lost 1.0 percent, the S&P declined 0.6 percent and the Nasdaq slipped 0.1 percent. 
The US dollar rallied and advanced against all of its major counterparts
1035 2018-02-20 22:42:41 bump stocks are a novelty that only idiots would purchase. banning them is insignificant, but makes Trump look vigilant/responsive. good move.
1036 2018-02-20 22:42:32 Trump signed an executive order to ban bump stocks, while personally I don’t have a desire to use one or own one I do have a problem with it.
1037 2018-02-20 22:42:28 I didn’t even know bump stocks were legal, that’s crazy. Hopefully trump can ban them.
1038 2018-02-20 22:42:24 Let’s ban if it means something. But this means nothing and would’ve had no impact. No shooter has used bump stocks on a mass shooting. Yes LV shooter had them in his armory,but they were’nt used.  

How bout enforcing existing  laws so suspect troubled children can’t purchase!??
1039 2018-02-20 22:42:18 So when banning bump stocks doesn't work, will the feds give us all suspenders to compensate for the belt loops they'll confiscate afterwards?
1040 2018-02-20 22:42:18 Banning bump stocks in the wake of the FL shooting is probably the least "controversial" thing Trump can do without infuriating his base while making it seem like he's doing something. What a crock.
1041 2018-02-20 22:42:14 @NRA are the terror lobbyists. Ban assault weapons high capacity magazines, bump stocks, suppressors. Outlaw #NRA. Regulate/license existing guns. Make America Safe Again. #MASA
1042 2018-02-20 22:42:10 Flavour. Almost all French classics begin with onion, carrot and celery as a base for soups, stocks and sauces. You never really taste it (unless you leave chunks of it in)
1043 2018-02-20 22:42:04 Pres @realDonaldTrump Sir it's not the weapons nor the tools like the stocks that are the problem at all, Sir. I've owned firearms my whole adult life.  The problem is Jesus Christ needs to be put back in the school system.  Having a healthy fear of our Lord is not taught...
1044 2018-02-20 22:42:03 Trumps call to DOJ to ban bump stocks in and of itself is a good first step, “about Time!”. But this is a f.. smoke screen dude... ban the assault weapons!!
1045 2018-02-20 22:42:03 Does that include bump stocks?  Whoops, that ones gone.
1046 2018-02-20 22:41:57 TIL  that a chimpanzee became the 22nd most successful money manager on Wall  St after choosing stocks by throwing darts at a board of 133 tech  companies.
1047 2018-02-20 22:41:48 The president has asked congress to make bump stocks or any other modification illegal that make a gun illegally automatic. 

It's a start!  Should've been done years ago!!
Now let's do it congress!!!  #neveragain
1048 2018-02-20 22:41:44 To late for you if trump does ban bump stocks and wants better back ground checks for you to get any credit for it you had 8 years!
1049 2018-02-20 22:41:40 Trump appoints special group to figure out difference between Bitcoin and Bump Stocks
1050 2018-02-20 22:41:37 @realDonaldTrump do you really think banning bump stocks is gonna prevent mass shootings ?? That's like banning pepperoni on pizza, just because you got rid of something added onto it doesn't mean there isn't a whole cheese pizza still there 
1051 2018-02-20 22:41:30 So #shithole signed a "memo" regarding 'bump stocks?" Why not one of his grand shows of signing an EO? Why do I know, deep down inside, this is another attempt at switching the dialogue from A to B, & in the end nothing will be changed? I despise that Russian loving MORON.
1052 2018-02-20 22:41:29 executive action can be repealed at anytime. @realDonaldTrump repealed DACA. We need to re-authorized @SenFeinstein assault weapons ban, Congress needs to pass a bill banning bump stocks. @realDonaldTrump actions are useless.
1053 2018-02-20 22:41:26 Consider the parallel between 'bump stocks' and the ongoing bump in the stock market. 

Bump Stock = BS 

Stock Market = SM ≈ "sex sells"
1054 2018-02-20 22:41:21 I like the move. People voted for Trump because he can go left or go right when it's necessary. Bump stocks aren't necessary.
1055 2018-02-20 22:41:20 Apparently Trump has actually moved to try and get bump stocks (like that used in Las Vegas to make a semi-auto act like a full-auto) banned.
I'm actually pleasantly surprised by something @realDonaldTrump has done for once.
It's not enough, but it's something, I suppose?
1056 2018-02-20 22:41:19 *Bump stocks
1057 2018-02-20 22:41:02 No credit deserved. Bump stocks are made by small independent suppliers who don't fund the NRA. Sacrificing them is an easy win for him.
1058 2018-02-20 22:41:00 Bump stocks absolutely do not make semi-autos more lethal. It's makes them highly inaccurate and unreliable. Vegas shooter and multiple jammed guns with near full magazines due to the bump stocks
1059 2018-02-20 22:41:00 Banning bump stocks is only the tiniest little answer. Banks/cc can refuse to process orders. No more AR-15s. Actual mental health coverage.
1060 2018-02-20 22:40:53 Hey trump, what is the least you can do to solve gun violence while acting like you did something? Ban bump stocks!
1061 2018-02-20 22:40:52 Why is it if President Trump comes out urging a ban on bump stocks which enabled the horrible massacre last week in Florida, that only Fox news reports it? Where is CBS, CNN, NBC and ABC? Who is fake news, and who is fair and balanced?
1062 2018-02-20 22:40:50 Trump banning "bump stocks" is like trying to ban needles so heroin users cant get high. THEY WILL STILL GET HIGH
1063 2018-02-20 22:40:49 Bump stocks: In drug terms, Trump just suggested that we consider a ban on freebasing while avoiding the topic of making cocaine and crack cocaine at least more regulated.
1064 2018-02-20 22:40:48 Trump is moving to make bump stocks (which were made legal under Obama) illegal. If that happens, he will have done more to stop mass shootings than Obama did in 8 years.
1065 2018-02-20 22:40:45 Trying to learn more about stocks etc. though so I can start hitting em heavy. It’s kinda fun.
1066 2018-02-20 22:40:43 No les pareció un breakout fallido?
1067 2018-02-20 22:40:42 Anything about the executive order to ban bump stocks or just more of the salacious bullshit
1068 2018-02-20 22:40:42 Bump stocks were a very particular type of horror show and have no place being sold anywhere, but do not be fooled into thinking that does anything about all these other mass shootings.  Ban assault weapons @realDonaldTrump!
1069 2018-02-20 22:40:34 He's doing it to avoid addressing assault weapons. Bump stocks were not involved in the school shooting in FL.
1070 2018-02-20 22:40:34 @realDonaldTrump 
Ban on bump stocks? That was the last mass shooting issue. Too little-too late. BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS!
1071 2018-02-20 22:40:33 Wall Mart just took it worst Hit in the Stock Market sense 1989, an there's your Tax Cut for you!Your no longer riding on the Obama Economy, an 64 Sam's Wall Mart Store's closed their door/stocks are crashing for them!Dow down /and falling! Not Bump Stock, but AR-15/Ammo! Got it?
1072 2018-02-20 22:40:25 Feinstein on Trump asking DOJ for regs to ban bump stocks: "ATF currently lacks authority under the law to ban bump stocks. The agency made this clear in a 2013 letter to Congress, writing that ‘stocks of this type are not subject to the provisions of federal firearms statutes’
1073 2018-02-20 22:40:12 Instead of making Bump stocks illegal why not make murder illegal?

Laws don't work. Saving families, saving faith, and encouraging decency does.
1074 2018-02-20 22:40:12 Banning Bump Stocks will only stop the liberals.
Google 'bump fire'.
1075 2018-02-20 22:40:03 These people care more about "bump stocks" than humans.
1076 2018-02-20 22:39:49 all that did is literally-sell out bump stocks in October of this year-which is why they are willing to feign compassion and throw them under the bus now-how devious and sad for a nation-where it's leaders throw out an already dead body to appease justice?
1077 2018-02-20 22:39:47 look at 45 being all proud of himself for signing a bill about bump stocks. dude, everyone knows you are still a putz.
1078 2018-02-20 22:39:45 Bump stocks?!!!
That was their recipe for avoiding gun laws after the Las Vegas shooting, but they didn’t follow through.
Now?
#ToneDeaf
1079 2018-02-20 22:39:44 Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but since ATF regulations fall under his authority couldn't Trump issue an executive order tonight to take bump stocks off the approved list of gun parts/accessories?
1080 2018-02-20 22:39:44 A regulatory ban on bump stocks was endorsed by the NRA last fall, no?
1081 2018-02-20 22:39:43 Sessions answer will be "it's illegal and unconstitutional to ban bump stocks." 

Wait and see.
1082 2018-02-20 22:39:25 Maybe because they are the weapon of choice in mass shootings. 11 mass shooting since 2012 we’re done using AR15. Powerful and capable of accepting high capacity mags. Just curious, what are your thoughts on bump stocks?
1083 2018-02-20 22:39:23 Since the NRA was cool with throwing in bump stocks as a concession tRump is too. Now he can crow about how he took action in the wake of the shooting. #NRAIsATerroristOrganization #NRABloodMoney #GunContolNow #trumpfail
1084 2018-02-20 22:39:22 Ban what you want folks. Drugs are outlawed also but does that stop these worthless fucks from taking and selling? Nope and you'll never take my bump stocks. Nice try though. Lol keep it up and the revolution will be here soon i promise. You can everything and we'll still own !!
1085 2018-02-20 22:39:21 @realDonaldTrump Trump says he is banning Bump Stocks! We shall see, it's a start if it's not a lie! #MAGA #2ndAmendment #Deplorables
1086 2018-02-20 22:39:11 Bump stocks? Were not used in Parkland massacre. They were used in Oct. 2017. Should he not have proposed this ban in Oct. 2017 when Las Vegas massacre occurred? The subject now is AR-15’s. This makes no sense.
1087 2018-02-20 22:39:00 And... You still don't need a bump stock to bump-fire a semi-auto rifle.  Most gun owners don't own Bump Stocks, but most of us can see the slippery slope when the new regulations calls for a ban on "rate-increasing devices!" #GunOwners
1088 2018-02-20 22:38:58 Pro-Tip: If you want more funding for your classroom, call your crayons "bullets," your books "magazines," and your Elmer's paste "AR-15 semiautomatic rifles with bump stocks and Bushnell TRS-25 HiRise Red Dot sights." Congress will shower you in supplies.
1089 2018-02-20 22:38:55 As in, I’ve been watching my happily gun-toting tweeters and they are a-okay with bump stocks being gone. Some with assault rifles as well.
1090 2018-02-20 22:38:53 So should we keep bump stocks then?
1091 2018-02-20 22:38:50 The president plans to ban bumpfire stocks. Is shall not be infringed that hard to understand??? The Founding Fathers must be rolling in their graves right now!!!
1092 2018-02-20 22:38:48 @maura_healey I understand the President is talking about banning bump stocks "very soon," and I wanted to thank the AGs office for having done it already.
1093 2018-02-20 22:38:47 They come from the North Sea because that’s where the significant sustainable cod stocks are! The largest cod stocks are off the coast of Norway. By a long way. Cod are also semi-migratory so during the warmer months are less prevalent in southern waters.
1094 2018-02-20 22:38:47 President directs attorney general to dedicate "all available resources" to review and rewrite of regs on bump stocks. 

Sen. Feinstein says ATF has no authority to ban them, warns of court challenges. Legislative ban is "the only answer," she says.
1095 2018-02-20 22:38:46 50% of the country doesn’t have stocks...
1096 2018-02-20 22:38:42 I'm a staunch 2nd Amendment supporter, but I have to say I don't have a problem with doing away with bump stocks. They ruin accuracy, and their purpose is sketchy, IMO.
1097 2018-02-20 22:38:39 We need a conversation about bump stocks, mental illness and their access to guns, violent people killing vidio games and the decay and breakdown of the family.  Gun control does not work.
1098 2018-02-20 22:38:34 But these bump stocks are used only for hunting, and those purchasing them must pinky promise not to use them for nefarious purposes. 
1099 2018-02-20 22:38:32 It's not meaningless. The #VegasShooting used bump stocks to kill all those people. It's still just #45 talking and no action. Give credit when it's due. #BanAR15 #nra #ParklandStrong
1100 2018-02-20 22:38:23 So Cadet Bone Spur was given permission from the NRA to give up bump stocks. Shows what a tool he is. NRA and gun dealers must not have made big money on it. So how about they up to ARs and AKs. Neither of which are hunting weapons to put food on table only used to murder people.
1101 2018-02-20 22:38:19 "TRUMP TELLS SESSIONS TO BAN BUMP STOCKS!"

No. He didnt. 

He wrote a memo asking Sessions to look into the legality of bump stocks and the legality of banning them. 

That's all. 

Dollars to donuts Sessions finds it's "illegal" to ban bumpstocks.
1102 2018-02-20 22:38:17 The ban on bump stocks is a lame start. The real problem is combat ready weapons available to American citizens. Indeed readily available. Not much wait "if any". The President also did not say anything in this about broader background checks.
1103 2018-02-20 22:38:14 Banning Bump Stocks???
Trump really thinks thats going to stop mass shootings?
WOW!
1104 2018-02-20 22:38:04 Try banning bump stocks.
1105 2018-02-20 22:38:01 Also...we will not accept only banning bump stocks.
1106 2018-02-20 22:38:00 DO YOU SUPPORT THISThen renew 1994 Ban on Assault Weapons WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has directed his attorney general to propose regulations that would ban bump stocks and similar devices "that turn legal weapons into machine guns," the president announced Tuesday.
1107 2018-02-20 22:37:58 @realDonaldTrump even with the bump stocks we do not have an even the match when it comes to Small Arms with our military
1108 2018-02-20 22:37:56 Too little because the states just had another mass shooting that did not involve bump stocks! Trump gets 30 million from the NRA and he does want to do anything that will upset them!!!!
1109 2018-02-20 22:37:52 Next time a politician tells you that banning assault rifles or bump stocks won’t make a difference due to the already existing proliferation of weapons ask them why drugs are illegal.
1110 2018-02-20 22:37:52 I understand your point, so what’s your solution? I am happy to see progress and now Trump wants to ban bump stocks. This is progress with a dysfunctional D.C
1111 2018-02-20 22:37:48 Guaranteed trump was told by the NRA to let the dems have the bump stocks, theyll consider it a win and it will stop at that
1112 2018-02-20 22:37:46 FWIW, consumer staples underperform in rising rate environments. Like utilities, lowered optimism and appetite for low growth yield stocks.
1113 2018-02-20 22:37:42 Except bump stocks don’t actually turn rifles into automatic weapons.
1114 2018-02-20 22:37:35 @AZHouseDems accuse @AZHouseGOP of killing a bill that would ban bump stocks in AZ, even as @realDonaldTrump pushes a similar proposal.  The bill sponsor:  @DrRandyFriese, a trauma surgeon who treated Gabby Giffords.
1115 2018-02-20 22:37:30 So we got a ban on bump stocks .... how will that stop the killing period ... will it just limit the number of dead bodies 
1116 2018-02-20 22:37:24 GUN LAWS: Trump signs memorandum on bump stocks - overruling review
1117 2018-02-20 22:37:23 SO TRUMP SIGN A BILL TO STOP BUMP STOCKS. GUN GRABBERS ARE YOU HAPPY? Guess what, IT WILL NEVER MAKE A DIFFERENCE !! 
Criminals can get MACHINE GUNS, THEY CAN BUILD THEM....
So what’s next...?
1118 2018-02-20 22:37:20 Trump bans bump stocks. First step
1119 2018-02-20 22:37:18 Without bump stocks, easily purchasable AR 15's will spray a PALTRY 45 bullets per minute into the bodies of our children, students, and crowds of music fans. What a stand. What a heroic move.
1120 2018-02-20 22:37:17 Oh you mean the same bump stocks that Obama approved the sale of?
1121 2018-02-20 22:37:17 It’s cute that he thinks bump stocks are the problem.
1122 2018-02-20 22:37:12 Trump wants to ban Bump Stocks and people are still outraged. Its likely as close as you're gonna get when it comes to an "assault weapon" ban. AR-15s aren't going anywhere. Better background checks however need to be brought in ASAP.
1123 2018-02-20 22:37:11 Yet everyone called for it and agreed to it after LV shooting and fuck all was done. You should be glad he's pushing for them to follow through on it finally instead of just letting bump stocks slide and moving on then we get another LV style shooting.
1124 2018-02-20 22:36:59 And evidently this is what started Trump's ban on "bump stocks."  He can write some recommendation about it citing this incident but there's not one iota of an honest investigation.
1125 2018-02-20 22:36:57 What do you recommend he does, sir?  He just ordered the banning of bumb stocks.  We already have background checks.  People who are deemed dangerous or a threat to society are already banned from buying guns.
1126 2018-02-20 22:36:54 Trump calling for ban on Bump Stocks. Good motion, hope it goes through quickly.
1127 2018-02-20 22:36:53 Obama Administration approved the sale of ‘ bump stocks’ not once but twice!!!
1128 2018-02-20 22:36:49 Although, I do feel that bump stocks should be banned ....
1129 2018-02-20 22:36:35 Fox and Friends must have just gotten around to mentioning bump stocks.
1130 2018-02-20 22:36:30 And that's the entire reason #DonTheCon gave Sessions the go-ahead for banning bump stocks today: The NRA GAVE HIM PERMISSION
1131 2018-02-20 22:36:11 Fine.  Watch a YouTube video and learn to bump fire without accessories.  Ban bump stocks then shut up please.
1132 2018-02-20 22:36:10 President Trump, has ordered regulations to ban “bump stocks,” which make semi-automatic guns more lethal!
 NOW FBI top slugs must be fired by SESSIONS!
1133 2018-02-20 22:36:07 Do some research on bump stocks they are useless and only used by people who don't know how to shoot guns
1134 2018-02-20 22:36:04 @realDonaldTrump NO INFRINGEMENT means leaving bump stocks ALONE TOO!!!!!
1135 2018-02-20 22:35:59 BUT the Obama said they were OK......but that's Trumps fault??? You Partisan people are killing this country. Trumps a bad President......but he didnt make bump stocks legal....the Obama admin did that.
1136 2018-02-20 22:35:43 And people can still buy bump stocks. Good job.
1137 2018-02-20 22:35:41 Feeling the heat, Trump wants to ban...bump stocks. Nearly 40K gun deaths a year. This is like treating cancer with aspirin.
1138 2018-02-20 22:35:40 Strong support. He signed a MEMORANDUM to produce a PROPOSAL related to bump stocks! @PressSec will be assigning blame shortly! Las Vegas happened last October. This is the best we can get?
1139 2018-02-20 22:35:36 I agree nobody should be able to come take away our guns if we are law abiding citizens. But do you think it is right that just anyone can buy a rifle large capacity mags and bump stocks or triggers to make them fully auto. I do know what you are talking about and understand.
1140 2018-02-20 22:35:29 Hopefully they can take some measure of consolation in the fact that at about the same time the WH press secretary announced the Justice Dept was looking into banning bump stocks, something that did not happen after LV, because of these kids.
1141 2018-02-20 22:35:25 I wonder if @realDonaldTrump will be banning belt loops to end the menace of bump stocks?
1142 2018-02-20 22:35:17 If inflation exceeds two percent and long-term interest rates climb to 3 percent, shares will go down. But stocks with a good dividend level do not have to suffer much. A good development if the real economy becomes stronger.
1143 2018-02-20 22:35:14 @realDonaldTrump Banning bump stocks and triggers and stuff like that on Firearms does not deter anybody from doing anything that's exactly what the left wants you to do mr. President and frankly I am appalled that you're falling for that type and style of control
1144 2018-02-20 22:35:07 Ok, I see what you are saying. I’m not that familiar on how bump stocks work. Does it require the shooter to pull the trigger repeatedly? How exactly does it increase rate of fire?
1145 2018-02-20 22:35:03 People selling stocks... I believe(?)
1146 2018-02-20 22:34:59 Bump stocks?  Why not go for it and ban civilian use of weapons of war? Little donny johnny is pulling a leg or two.  This really is smoke and mirrors.
1147 2018-02-20 22:34:55 Bump stocks should be illegal
1148 2018-02-20 22:34:51 so it seams that @realDonaldTrump wants to to pass a gun control law putting a band on bump stocks. if this is accurate it's a sad day for 2nd Amendment lovers
1149 2018-02-20 22:34:42 Bump stocks will probably get banned soon. I had one and found it to be flawed. It rarely performed well. I sold mine.
1150 2018-02-20 22:34:41 Bump stocks have NOTHING to do with #2A rights. Don't be stupid!
Bump stocks are a terrible gun accessory. Ban them. They are a waste of money anyway
1151 2018-02-20 22:34:34 Personally, I have no issue with a bump-stock ban.

However, be forewarned. At best, it's a cosmetic solution. It would appear that bump stocks could easily be 3-D printed. A ban will create a big financial incentive for those who will violate the law anyway.
1152 2018-02-20 22:34:24 I don't have a bit of problem with Donald Trump trying to get legislation passed to stop the cell of bump stocks even though I don't think it will slow them down any it will at least give people the possibility of going to jail if they possess them.
1153 2018-02-20 22:34:23 It seemed we were having a reasonable conversation. Why'd you then dive into accusations of blind hatred? When I heard Sarah S say he was against bump stocks, I was quite pleased. I wondered if that will change once the NRA hears of it, but pleased, depending on what occurs.
1154 2018-02-20 22:34:13 Firstly, how would this have helped the latest victims?  Banning bump stocks is probably what the NRA is willing to let the #CorruptGOP do for now, till things calm down.  Guess what? Things will #NeverAgain calm down. #TraitorTrump #TraitorPence #TraitorNRA #NeverAgain
1155 2018-02-20 22:34:11 News: "Trump moves to ban 'bump stocks'"

@NRA/#2A: "ANOTHER restriction? Where will it end?"

Murdered children:
1156 2018-02-20 22:34:09 I'm happy that our government is banning bump stocks but this is NOT a solution to the entire problem and cannot be used as an excuse to say something has been done towards gun control.
1157 2018-02-20 22:34:03 Okay, can't you give Trump a little bit of credit here.l? I don't like him either, but a potential ban on bump stocks is a step in the right direction.
1158 2018-02-20 22:34:02 Bump stocks aren't a device that turns legal weapons into machine-guns b/c they do not alter a gun's internal mechanisms. The ATF would have to change the way it interpreted the National Firearms Act or issue new legislation allowing bump stocks 2 B regulated. (Per @PolitiFact )

1164 2018-02-20 22:33:58 Sounds like it's *written* by the NRA to avoid outlawing bump stocks. They've made noises that sound sorta kinda like they'll not block such laws without actually saying so, and that's exactly what this is.

Bottom line is bump stock manufacturers get to keep selling them.
1165 2018-02-20 22:33:57 @realDonaldTrump 
Banning Bump stocks is a good start.  Now:
Ban AR-15
Tighten gun laws
Tackle mental health

Thank You
1166 2018-02-20 22:33:54 “Only Nixon could go to China” is overplayed but the Trump administration banning bump stocks certainly has an echo of it
1167 2018-02-20 22:33:37 Trump asks Sessions to issue ban on bump stocks!?  What is his Executive Order Pen out of ink?
1168 2018-02-20 22:33:35 No the Bump Stocks memo doesn’t ask for ban. It asks for: 
A) review of public comments arguing definition of ‘machine gun’ & whether #bumpstocks "turn legal weapons into machine guns" 
B) A ban if it’s agreed they do

Of course comments will say they don’t. WH can say they tried
1169 2018-02-20 22:33:32 Banning bump stocks seems constitutional. Banning assault weapons is pointless because someone will just create them to look differently. That's a stupid term to ban. 
Don't know what a listener requirement per gun means but a license to operate is infringing.
1170 2018-02-20 22:33:29 Even though bump stocks were likely not even used.
1171 2018-02-20 22:33:27 $SPY Whether that was bottom or not last week remains to be seen but loving this volatility for trading stocks like $LABU $PI $W $UVXY etc.
1172 2018-02-20 22:33:26 It is just talk until we see the language of the proposed ban and see the ban actually enforced. A ban should involve not just an end to sales, but the confiscation of bump stocks. Absent that, there is no real ban, just a feint to dodge criticism and lull the gullible media.
1173 2018-02-20 22:33:21 "Dear ammosexuals who haven't gotten around to buying your bump stocks yet: They're legal, but the clock is ticking. You still have a while to stock up, but we had to give them something..."
Love, DJT
1174 2018-02-20 22:33:13 @realDonaldTrump you realize even the NRA thinks Bump Stocks should be illegal right?  Man up grow some balls and ban assault weapons of war. Your bump stock move isn’t appeasing any of us. Your behind, you should have done that immediately after Vegas. Quit kissing the NRA ass.
1175 2018-02-20 22:33:13 there were no bump stocks used last week
1176 2018-02-20 22:33:09 Come on Jon. The route Trump is taking in bump stocks is a slow roll process giving Americans the illusion he’s doing something w/o doing it. I’ll believe it when I see it. “Regulate or ban”. There’s a big difference.
1177 2018-02-20 22:33:08 end of last year stocks lookn bright.  today shows me that i was not wrong.  yhe market hates me.
1178 2018-02-20 22:33:07 Banning  bump stocks is a START no previous regimes have done anything like this yet people are still going to bitch smh
1179 2018-02-20 22:33:00 @realdonaldtrump Ah bump stocks didnt kill students in Florida.
1180 2018-02-20 22:33:00 Remind me who admin made bump stocks legal???? I give you a hint......Obam*.
1181 2018-02-20 22:32:57 I'm trying to figure out how banning bump stocks would have stopped Cruz.
1182 2018-02-20 22:32:54 So I bought some stocks right....never again.
1183 2018-02-20 22:32:46 When all else fails, point at Obama, right?  Still bump stocks was Vegas.  Drumpf needed 30 more deaths to reconsider.  Pathetic.
1184 2018-02-20 22:32:42 "The Obama rule would have prevented an estimated 75,000 people with mental disorders from being able to purchase a firearm." It was a small step. About as small as banning bump stocks.
1185 2018-02-20 22:32:39 President Trump supports a ban on bump stocks. He also expressed support for bolstered firearm background checks with an emphasis on mental health. This is BS! No more infringing on the #2A. Too many laws already! Let the teachers be armed and employ armed school security!
#MAGA
1186 2018-02-20 22:32:32 Soooooo Trump is going to repeal mental health checks to buy guns but is trying to ban bump stocks? How ass backwards do you have to be?
1187 2018-02-20 22:32:31 So... @realDonaldTrump is pushing for bump stocks -- devices that turn weapond into machine guns according to CNBC. Either Trump is a fool (99.9% likely) or CNBC is "fake news."
1188 2018-02-20 22:32:29 Bump stocks aren't a device that turns legal weapons into machine-guns b/c they do not alter a gun's internal mechanisms. The ATF would have to change the way it interpreted the National Firearms Act or issue new legislation allowing bump stocks 2 B regulated. (Per @PolitiFact )
1189 2018-02-20 22:32:27 I never even heard of bump stocks before the Las Vegas shooting.
1190 2018-02-20 22:32:18 @realDonaldTrump : TRUMPet : You are Skirting the main Issue..
What the Hell Use is banning Bump Stocks when Auto Rifles are Readily Available?
Why no Real Gun Control?
You will try Anything to FOOL CARING AMERICANS and Keep Your NRA BLOCKHEAD  COMRADES SWEET!!!
Come On!!!
1191 2018-02-20 22:32:17 Lol. Bump stocks don’t turn rifles into machine guns! 
1192 2018-02-20 22:32:16 So it orders the creation of a new reg specifically for bump stocks because they function to create weapons that conceivably fall under the full auto regs.
1193 2018-02-20 22:32:16 But it *will* drive up the demand for bump stocks. Way to go, #DotardDonnie. Vegas redux in 3.. 2..
1194 2018-02-20 22:32:15 .@realDonaldTrump Banning bump stocks et al. Is a rubber band covered by this? Can do what a BS does. See YouTube. So sad. Miller, bad decision. So flawed. Research the NFA acts. They're anti-2A. So sad. So sad. So un-Americanly sad.

@NRA @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity #NRA
1195 2018-02-20 22:32:14 A start but not enough. How abput banning those assault rifl3s those bump stocks go on trump.
1196 2018-02-20 22:32:14 We need a ban on assault style weapons. Prohibiting bump stocks is a start. Let's get a ban on assault weapons and see what the Supreme Court does with it.
1197 2018-02-20 22:32:06 Breaking (5:31 PM EST): Stocks making the biggest moves after hours: LendingClub, Boyd Gaming, Texas Roadhouse & more... -- CNBC
1198 2018-02-20 22:32:01 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Romney  now bump stocks. Never be satisfied they want us defenseless. Not a good day 4 your supporters.
1199 2018-02-20 22:32:01 He sound real stupid. Trump know damn well the bump stocks are legal.
1200 2018-02-20 22:31:57 That may be so, but they will never be satisfied until they have complete control. Before you know it they will be after foreword grips, adjustable stocks, bayonet lugs. Who knows
1201 2018-02-20 22:31:52 Bump stocks had nothing to do with the high school shooting.  Gun experts have the ability to make their own machine gun if they want to.  Machine guns are already illegal.
1202 2018-02-20 22:31:51 And there's hundreds of videos showing how effective and dangerous bump stocks can be. Yawn.
1203 2018-02-20 22:31:49 Sometomes I worry about what will happen to my gaming stocks when, eventually, the whole world only plays #Fortnite
1204 2018-02-20 22:31:47 Banning bump stocks is safe for GOP #NRAwhores. 
NRA said they were OK w that so no big stretch.
RepubliCons won't do anything to jeopardize their NRA CASH flow. If we don't repeal Citizens United this democracy is HISTORY
1205 2018-02-20 22:31:43 So then we keep status quo because it doesn't predict the future...maybe a more involved background check could show patterns of behavior. Waiting periods are important too. Banning bump stocks. Nothing will be a perfect solution but we need to something instead of nothing.
1206 2018-02-20 22:31:42 You neglected to mention that they WILL be voting on banning bump stocks and raising the age limit to purchase firearms from 18 to 21. Sometimes it’s what you leave out that matters! #2A
1207 2018-02-20 22:31:35 "Bump Stocks" are OLD News.....the CURRENT news is assault weapons..
1208 2018-02-20 22:31:30 Trump wants to just ban bump stocks for assault weapons.  NOT ENOUGH!  AR-15 assault rifles were designed for the military for one purpose only...  to kill another human  being in wartime.  They need to be banned from buying them and for owning them.
1209 2018-02-20 22:31:27 @realDonaldTrump @CharlesPPierce @NRA.  Bump stock used in Vegas, not TX or FL.  No WH action 4 four months and NOW?? BAN bump stocks???
1210 2018-02-20 22:31:27 Just saw a headline on FB that says Trump ordered his attorney general to propose changes that would ban bump stocks. If I believed in hell, I would think it's frozen over.
1211 2018-02-20 22:31:26 Which is why I said "pretending to"..... please learn how to read, and bump stocks are more of a hindrance than anything.
1212 2018-02-20 22:31:22 Don’t buy the hype: The NRA is using bump stocks to distract from something far worse
The U.S. doesn’t have a bump stock problem; we have a gun violence problem.
1213 2018-02-20 22:31:21 My point was that that % could be explained by both EU and UK fishermen selling their catch in the EU due to the fish types there suiting their tastes. Your mention of cod threw me because our cod stocks come from the North Sea, not Cornish water.
1214 2018-02-20 22:31:10 How bout that Trump banning bump stocks!! No comment yet!?!
1215 2018-02-20 22:31:10 The irony is that Trump just asked the Attorney General to ban bump stocks.
1216 2018-02-20 22:31:07 The Las Vegas shooting where bump stocks were used was on Oct. 1, 2017. What took so long? Did he have to confer with the NRA and get their OK to use this as a "meaningful action" (deflection) first?
1217 2018-02-20 22:31:06 @realDonaldTrump Now that you have decided to ban Bump stocks, why don't you find out what really happened in Vegas.   There are still a lot of unanswered questions.
1218 2018-02-20 22:31:02 This is called negotiating. Losing bump stocks is leverage.
1219 2018-02-20 22:30:56 Mr trump is pushing for a ban on bump stocks who knows they might add binary triggers too
1220 2018-02-20 22:30:52 Publicity stunt. Nothing more. He's declaring he's taking action to reduce some of the heat on him. But he knows damn good & well that neither the AG nor POTUS has the authority or power to ban bump stocks. So nothing actually changes.
1221 2018-02-20 22:30:48 Bump stocks aren't a device that turns legal weapons into machine-guns b/c they do not alter a gun's internal mechanisms. The ATF would have to change the way it interpreted the National Firearms Act or issue new legislation allowing bump stocks 2 B regulated. (Per @PolitiFact )
1222 2018-02-20 22:30:34 With this #GOP I will take anything. The Las Vegas shooter used bump stocks.
1223 2018-02-20 22:30:34 Trump is ok with banning bump stocks? 
True.

I guess the NRA does not represent the bump stock manufacturers.
1224 2018-02-20 22:30:32 The memo stops short of saying bump stocks are illegal under existing regulations (because they’re not). That’s just in there to insinuate the Obama admin is to blame for Vegas. Rather, it says that they turn guns into prohibited full autos.
1225 2018-02-20 22:30:27 Bullshit. People can say they don't care about bump stocks but I do. This could be the beginning of another "assault weapons ban" then what?
1226 2018-02-20 22:30:20 Coming soon far and wide....A bump stocks ban.
1227 2018-02-20 22:30:20 Thank you Mr Trump for taking steps to ban, “bump stocks.”
1228 2018-02-20 22:30:12 @POTUS just proposed a ban on bump stocks. Does anybody wanna buy mine? Value just went up. Hit me up.
1229 2018-02-20 22:30:11 Trump's going to ban bump stocks.
1230 2018-02-20 22:30:03 I understand the Teacher's Union is also heavily invested in ADHD/Aderol/Ritalin type drug stocks as well?
1231 2018-02-20 22:30:01 Trump’s proclamation on bump stocks is an optical illusion! A mere slow roll process to make it look like he’s doing something w/o doing anything. Such bullshit! Florida House had an opportunity to make a real difference and they said eff you Parkland! I vote in FL. Buh bye R’s
1232 2018-02-20 22:30:01 Bump stocks is a gimme. The NRA already conceded to supporting a ban on bump stocks after Vegas.
1233 2018-02-20 22:30:01 That's great, no one needs bump stocks but it's not enough, ban the military style rifles that were made for the military.
1234 2018-02-20 22:29:55 In Parkland, the shooter didn't use a bump stock.

Trump asking for a ban on bump stocks to stop mass shootings is like Trump throwing paper towels at hurricane victims.
1235 2018-02-20 22:29:54 bump stocks and background checks seem pretty "too little too late".  ban all guns and republicans
1236 2018-02-20 22:29:37 Number of leading stocks today: 49 $SPY $QQQ $FB $GOOG $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL #DailyStkLeaderCount
1237 2018-02-20 22:29:34 @realDonaldTrump thinks banning bump stocks will make him look good.
It may have been a good step to take after the Vegas massacre (when he did nothing), but it is a very odd response to the Parkland shooting, and it makes him look uninformed, callous and scatterbrained
1238 2018-02-20 22:29:30 Yeah bump stocks are very bad
1239 2018-02-20 22:29:26 PLEASE PLEASE educate yourself, bump stocks do NOT make a weapon fully automatic.  Oh wait you don't care that you're wrong. You simply want to stir the pot
1240 2018-02-20 22:29:24 There goes President @realDonaldTrump, banning bump stocks like he knows what he's doing, and fuckin shame on the @NRA for standing by and allowing the left to dictate policy. Don't give me any "long game" bullshit. Fuck the @NRA #AllGunControlisRacist
1241 2018-02-20 22:29:21 So Trump ordered them to ban bump stocks...is he trying to make himself out to be a hero now after he passed the law to allow mentally ill people to buy firearms? I am so over this bullshit politics of playing with our lives!!!
1242 2018-02-20 22:29:20 God bless you President Trump in your decision to ban bump stocks it gives all families who have suffered confidence these weapons of death will be kept out of people who care not who they kill@realDonaldTrump
1243 2018-02-20 22:29:20 Who cares about bum stocks?  Semi-automatic riffles are the ones that should be banned.  No civilian including former military/law enforcement should be allowed to own semi-automatic riffles. #nra #GunReformNow #guncontrol
1244 2018-02-20 22:29:18 Dems always claim that they don’t want to abolish the 2nd amendment, they just want to “reform” it.

That’s BS. Trump urges the Justice Department to ban bump stocks and Dems are still complaining. They won’t stop until guns are completely banned.
1245 2018-02-20 22:29:13 This is an appeasement move. Nothing more or less. It doesn’t even address the issue of #Parkland.

Bump stocks are an accessory, and @GOP thinks we’re ignorant enough about guns to not realize this is putting a bandaid on an amputated limb.
1246 2018-02-20 22:29:00 Bump stocks and binary triggers are cool and I’m sure fun to shoot but I don’t have one and really I do not need one.
1247 2018-02-20 22:28:58 Bingo.
This is not enough. Bump stocks aren't used in these school shootings & there are a hell of a lot more to do than that.
1248 2018-02-20 22:28:57 Bump stocks banned? Well, alright then... problem solved!
1249 2018-02-20 22:28:52 Bump stocks are 100% legal based on current law.  Don’t like the law?  We have a process for that.  Congress!  Not @realDonaldTrump!#2A
1250 2018-02-20 22:28:52 Having a child on here saying for “years” she has heard these stories is almost amusing !! So at age 12 she knew all about the Constitution, the 2nd Ammendment, gun laws, the mentally ill, different fire arms, bump stocks, clips and calibers. Is she really a weapons expert ? 
1251 2018-02-20 22:28:51 Really @newtgingrich the ONLY idea you've got? No other possibilities? I dont recall that in the job description.  Armed officer was on premises in Parkland.  Hoq about more police? More mental health treatment? How about 0 assault weapons and bump stocks?
1252 2018-02-20 22:28:49 I’ll give Trump points for trying, but I’m not sure that I follow the logic. The Vegas shooter used a bump stock and the refrain was that bump stocks weren’t the problem. The Parkland shooter didn’t use bump stocks and the proposed solution is to ban bump stocks. I don’t follow.
1253 2018-02-20 22:28:45 #BREAKING President Trump directs US Justice to move to ban bump stocks MORE @nbcbayarea
1254 2018-02-20 22:28:35 trump makes the smart move and urges for a ban on bump stocks, which is a good idea really. let's see how the left tries to twist this one to somehow make him pushing for gun control a bad thing when they've been asking for it so intensely.
1255 2018-02-20 22:28:35 Credit where credit is due, President Trump. Banning bump stocks is a great first step towards common sense gun laws.
1256 2018-02-20 22:28:31 @cameron_kasky 

Per NYT BREAKING News, #NeverAgainMSD just got it's first victory. @realDonaldTrump ordered regulations to ban bump stocks. #OneSmallStep for #BigHeroes #LookOutNRA @NRA @realDonaldTrump @GOP #YourDone #BlueWave2018
1257 2018-02-20 22:28:30 Screw that. Ban assault weapons and then bump stocks would become completely useless.
1258 2018-02-20 22:28:28 Bump stocks didn’t require a new law. The obama atf made a ruling and allowed them.
1259 2018-02-20 22:28:18 @realDonaldTrump  I hope Jeff Sessions tells you to stick it on bump stocks.
1260 2018-02-20 22:28:17 "...bump stocks don't kill people, people kill people..."
1261 2018-02-20 22:28:08 #trump banning bump stocks ‘to protect the children’. Laughable. Completely ridiculous.
1262 2018-02-20 22:28:07 ban bump stocks if u dont know what it is look it up
1263 2018-02-20 22:28:00 Is this for any device or just bump stocks?
1264 2018-02-20 22:27:56 Keep thinking that if you throw them a bone they’ll wag their tail and slobber you with kisses.  Concessions only show weakness. I don’t have a bump stock, but the BATF approved the stocks not because they’re pro-gun but because they technically are legal. Don’t let them intimidt
1265 2018-02-20 22:27:50 Senator, I agree with you! Even his order banning bump stocks is junk, because he might repeal it hours or days later.
1266 2018-02-20 22:27:46 Banning bump stocks should have been done MONTHS ago. We can't let this token gesture overshadow the necessity of banning assault weapons. #BanAssaultWeapons #NeverAgain #Parkland
1267 2018-02-20 22:27:45 Banning bump stocks would be a great step but it’s odd it doesn’t happen until there’s a need to distract from the student (and country’s) outrage over latest shooting with an easily available  military weapon. Multiple steps needed to curb uniquely American gun violence.
1268 2018-02-20 22:27:29 Ban assault weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines.  Universal background checks.  End straw purchases, no private gun sales.  Red flag law that allows confiscation of a weapon when some one is reported as a threat for example something is posted on social media..etc
1269 2018-02-20 22:27:28 RT @PhilippeRevaz Trump dit vouloir bannir les “bump stocks”, qui permettent de tirer en rafale. Cela ne lui coûte rien politiquement (la NRA approuve). À noter que le  tueur de Parkland ne s’est pas servi de cet accessoire.
1270 2018-02-20 22:27:22 Bump stocks dont turn semiautomatic rifles into machine guns. It does make them fire faster though.
1271 2018-02-20 22:27:15 beans are super cheap so he stocks up on beans then realizes he has too many beans to justify buying more food and just eats beans for 6 weeks
1272 2018-02-20 22:27:09 What are your thoughts on Bump Stocks? #TwitterPoll #TuesdayThoughts
1273 2018-02-20 22:26:53 @realDonaldTrump Now that you have given in on Bump stocks the Dems are going to expect much more.  Inch by inch.
1274 2018-02-20 22:26:48 Trump pushes for ban on gun 'bump stocks'
1275 2018-02-20 22:26:48 Obligarlo dudolo mucho las aportaciones del NRA a los Republicans no los dejara. Al menos Trump ya prohibio los bump stocks en las armas
1276 2018-02-20 22:26:44 @realDonaldTrump stop blowing smoke up our a**. Bump stocks are already illegal. Enforce the law. You're fooling anyone. This is not #GunReformNOW #Parkland
1277 2018-02-20 22:26:38 If you would like to do something that Obama was never able to do, you could ban military style weapons, bump stocks and close the gun show loopholes. That'd really stick it in Obama's craw.
1278 2018-02-20 22:26:35 He knows ATF has no authority, by their own admission, to regulate bump stocks. He’s doing this to make himself look good, knowing it can’t work & the buck will be passed to Congress.
1279 2018-02-20 22:26:35 NRA is willing to give up bump stocks, they said.
1280 2018-02-20 22:26:34 I am 100% against gun control, but there was people abusing the bump stocks, and using them outside there original intentions. The people that were using them to make a semi-automatic and fully-automatic they are the reason bump stocks are getting banned.
1281 2018-02-20 22:26:29 Oh, I gotcha. When I first came across bump stocks online I was shocked. This was more than a year before Vegas. I knew that it was only a matter of time before someone killed with it.
1282 2018-02-20 22:26:23 To bad bump stocks had nothing to do with  the FL high school shooting. #sad
1283 2018-02-20 22:26:17 Bump stocks..... tf what's next vert grips? Flash hiders?...
1284 2018-02-20 22:26:14 @realDonaldTrump , shouldn't bump stocks have been banned after the shooting in Las Vegas?  You finally, decided to do something?  Why don't you go back to your party at your private disco, and let the people who actually know how to govern attempt do their jobs?
1285 2018-02-20 22:26:09 don't forget for one second that the proposal of a ban on bump stocks is a deflection to make you think that the white house is willing to take action on gun control. they want us to say "good enough" & compromise. don't.
1286 2018-02-20 22:26:06 But for the fact that banning bump stocks won't help the problem, but will allow Trump, NRA, etc to say, "See, we did something about gun control, so sit back and be quiet." NOPE. This is not even a concession on their part.
1287 2018-02-20 22:26:06 Bc bump stocks are basically a third party accessory. The banning of which will have no effect on gun manufacturers bottom lines. Unlike silencers.
1288 2018-02-20 22:26:05 Because Dems wanted more than bump stocks banned....
1289 2018-02-20 22:26:04 .@POTUS @realDonaldTrump instead of banning weapons from law abiding citizens how about making it easier that teachers can carry weapons in classes to defend their students.

The AR in AR-15 stands for ArmaLite rifle & not assault rifle. Banning bump stocks isn't right either.
1290 2018-02-20 22:25:49 I told my cat to take steps to ban bump stocks, so far they have made the same amount of progress.
1291 2018-02-20 22:25:47 Trump moves to ban rapid-fire gun 'bump stocks'
1292 2018-02-20 22:25:36 Ban bump stocks PO(TU)S? It's not enough tRump. You will not get away with throwing the dog a bone...gotta' be all assault weapons tRump. All of them. See Australia - that is how you "regulate" a "militia." Our children, the voters of 2020, demand this.
1293 2018-02-20 22:25:33 People will come up with ways to do this without bump stocks. Banning parts is not the answer. Training, educating, and arming citizens to protect our most vulnerable is the answer.
1294 2018-02-20 22:25:22 If you think bump stocks make any difference at all you're not into guns. He is pretending to give ground you're just too dumb to know. No serious gun owner uses bump stocks.
1295 2018-02-20 22:25:19 It is ironic, Obama was the #1 gun seller in American history. Yet he never had the cajones do put a stop to it. Trump just instructed Sessions to put a ban on bump stocks and other accessories that increase firing rates, which I am for by the way. Weird. Trump did more than O.
1296 2018-02-20 22:25:17 Bump Stocks  Nice Start. At the least, they should be regulated like fully automatic weapons thru the NFA. Semi-Auto is just as deadly if not more. In the military, Semi-Auto is the preferred selection in 90% of combat situations. One of the many, many reason=>KILLING EFFICIENCY
1297 2018-02-20 22:25:16 .@EdKrassen Trump will make limited movement on #GunControlNow bump stocks some background checks to appear he is doing something.  The #highschoomovement needs support to call BS
1298 2018-02-20 22:25:14 @realDonaldTrump Banning bump stocks is not enough! It is a consultation prize, which by the way was voted down by Republicans in Congress!
Do more!
Get the NRA out of your pocket! #NoNRAMoney
1299 2018-02-20 22:25:14 @realDonaldTrump Banning bump stocks is a good start but you are just trying to appease angry youth and the NRA. You can do better, ban military style weapons available to civilians. You have more to do than tweet about your sex life.
1300 2018-02-20 22:25:14 IMHO, tRump's bump stocks is just another red herring for show, and it will never be fully realized.
1301 2018-02-20 22:25:13 Nothing matters until military weapons are off the streets. Bump stocks, great - baby steps?
1302 2018-02-20 22:25:13 VirtualStormCEO LizCho7 Key word is "almost". I'm actually up in the air about bump stocks, but calling a weapon automatic when you put a bump stock on it just isn't true.
1303 2018-02-20 22:25:11 How many school shooters have used bump stocks?  Pretty sure the answer is Zero.
1304 2018-02-20 22:25:11 How long does it take to decide that banning bump stocks would be good idea? Less than 5 secs. That is all Trump has done. Obama did the same, and go nowhere because of NRA and Rep resistance. This will probably end same way.
1305 2018-02-20 22:25:02 Yeah nothing to see here kid move on .. Go chase one of those real stocks.  SMH..
1306 2018-02-20 22:24:59 Trump always tries to appease the leftists that will hate him no matter what he does. Banning bump stocks is a foolish endeavor that scores him zero political points.
1307 2018-02-20 22:24:54 @realDonaldTrump As a loyal supporter, and gun owner, you will lose massive voter support if you take ANY gun control acts, including AWB or bump stocks.  Reconsider.
1308 2018-02-20 22:24:48 Delay tactic. Congress can act on its own. Referring bump stocks to federal agency is being done to slow the process down.  Congress should act now. Feinstein et al have bill.
1309 2018-02-20 22:24:45 Last weekend the manufacturer was offering a 10% discount on bump stocks by using the discount code MAGA...I kid you not. So how many people do you think stocked up on them? Pardon the unintended pun.
1310 2018-02-20 22:24:45 I heard Trump is wanting to outlaw bump bangs, I ment bump stocks! 

1311 2018-02-20 22:24:40 Is it crazy to show appreciation to POTUS for saying he'll deal with bump stocks? He likes praise and maybe can be encouraged to seek more along these lines. Or is that just nuts?
1312 2018-02-20 22:24:35 @POTUS WTF ARE YOU DOING YOU TREASONOUS BASTARD.  BANNING BUMP STOCKS IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND WILL DO NO GOOD TO STOP ANY CRIME OR DEATH.  WILL NOT BE VOTING FOR YOU NEXT TIME AROUND YOU CUCK.
1313 2018-02-20 22:24:35 I know this but it does increase the rate of fire drastically i know this. TBH i agree with what he is doing the only ones that should have bump stocks are cops, federal agents, etc. Noone outside of those who use them for service and protecting
1314 2018-02-20 22:24:35 Ok, divorcing this from bump stocks entirely.

 Good stock placement is key to Rifle accuracy. To engage a target at 300+ yards the rifle has to be rock solid which is where stock placement comes in. (Also w/o the stock recoil would kick your ass in a non AR centerfire)
1315 2018-02-20 22:24:32 Trump urges ban on gun devices like bump stocks 
CLICK BELOW FOR FULL STORY.....
1316 2018-02-20 22:24:32 Nothing else. Wanted your thoughts on bump stocks. I vaguely (Coors Light) remember an auto vs semi auto discussion in Lake Geneva...
1317 2018-02-20 22:24:26 "Trump moves to ban bump stocks"
So he's one mass killing behind.
@realDonaldTrump #Trump #FloridaSchoolShooting
1318 2018-02-20 22:24:23 So-called bump stocks, which are legal, convert semi-automatic rifles into rapid-fire weapons.
1319 2018-02-20 22:24:21 I'm not happy with him endorsing Romney, hopefully he thinks about it and decides not to endorse him. For all we know, Trump might have had a long talk with Romney that night. The bump stocks on the other hand is a great idea, we don't need them and they make the guns illegal.
1320 2018-02-20 22:24:17 Obama never approved bump stocks. His ATF concluded twice that they couldn't regulate them under the language of the current law.
1321 2018-02-20 22:24:13 No he didn't, what he did was tell the AG to "propose"regs on bump stocks,  translated waste a couple wks/mths writing new regs until the short attn span of the American people loses focus and moves on just like after Vegas and the bump stock regs that quietly died in congress
1322 2018-02-20 22:24:05 @POTUS Bump Stocks Really Mr. President ??? How about a Ban On SSRI's.

#TheRealMeTooMovement #BanSSRIs
1323 2018-02-20 22:23:55 So you’re *unhappy* bump stocks may soon be illegal?
1324 2018-02-20 22:23:49 #DigixDAO new asset management coming silver, platinum, fees to go up 10x for cpin holders! This is just the start. Any asset can be split digitally and stored, including fine art, stocks, bonds, etc. Think BIG storage and auction answers with NO middleman.
1325 2018-02-20 22:23:48 Trump hosts the teen attention whores who are the only thing the left has, because there is no policy that can prevent shootings. The kiddies are star struck and the issue goes away like bump stocks have. #MAGA
1326 2018-02-20 22:23:46 Any talk about banning high capacity magazines or bump stocks or whatever isn't going to change things Our nation is awash in firearms Mass shootings will continue and more "thoughts and prayers" will have to suffice
1327 2018-02-20 22:23:43 Bump stocks can be made at home, banning bump stocks is a dog whistle. It is basically showing movement without doing anything meaningful.
1328 2018-02-20 22:23:43 What about the second amendment that you seem to want to destroy. Read it over and over. Learn it, learn the meaning and then look at your actions in the past few days. ie. urging bckgrd check reform, urging to regulate bump stocks you are going to loose us.
1329 2018-02-20 22:23:40 Laughing my a$$ off at all these #MAGA #NRA guys losing their sh*t bc Trump is talking about banning bump stocks.  Effing snowflakes. Your Orange Anus God doesn’t give a crap about you!
1330 2018-02-20 22:23:34 Literally no one has given a valid defense of bump-stocks.

Not one single person.
1331 2018-02-20 22:23:30 Wait. Aside from bump stocks, isn't turning your Mas Killing Mchine into a MKM+ illegal anyway? (I admit this is what I think is the case)
1332 2018-02-20 22:23:26 3 1/2 months after Vegas, in wake of Parkland shooting where 0 bump stocks were used...maybe we should ban them...you really thought hard on that one...
1333 2018-02-20 22:23:24 Trump moves to ban 'bump stocks' 4 months after Las Vegas shooting.  4 months huh?  Enough time for his son to make a profit on those, considering he sells them.
1334 2018-02-20 22:23:20 No one cares about bump stocks. It was a crumb to the left.
1335 2018-02-20 22:23:15 Start with banning assault rifles and bump stocks.
1336 2018-02-20 22:23:15 Interesting info I saw on $amzn Q4 results. They had 20M stocks awards outstanding. So thats !$29B with employees & if you assume 100K employees getting stock grants, thats still 290,000 of stock per employee.
1337 2018-02-20 22:23:14 Don’t get me wrong, I recognize the action, but I also see the potential of this being a mere NRA approved move, giving the appearance of doing something but intentionally not doing enough - considering bump stocks werent used in the FL assault.
1338 2018-02-20 22:23:14 Trump Directs DOJ to Ban Bump Stocks in Response to Gun Control Outcry
1339 2018-02-20 22:23:10 @GiselleCullinan check it out
1340 2018-02-20 22:23:09 @realDonaldTrump Why Mr. President did you CAVE IN on the Bump Stock Ban? There is no need for this ban!! Bump Stocks were not used in the Florida School shooting. #2A #NoGunBans #NoGunControl #MAGA #Freedom
1341 2018-02-20 22:22:57 He’s disgusting and the same guy who had a meltdown on #TuckerCarlson. The same guy who claimed he passed out & had a seizure bcuz someone tweeted a gif to him. The same guy who threatened to sue over Twitter. The same guy who told everyone to dump their stocks #samedisgustingguy
1342 2018-02-20 22:22:49 Bump stocks är en lika genial som sjuk modifikation. Men rätt rimligt att de förbjuds kan jag tycka.
1343 2018-02-20 22:22:42 bump stocks were approved during the obama admin but ya, blame trump
#LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
1344 2018-02-20 22:22:41 Because there probably aren't any bump stocks or kits in Denver.
1345 2018-02-20 22:22:37 Well bump stocks arent the big deal people tried to make them
1346 2018-02-20 22:22:37 How many people have been killed by bump stocks? What was the result last time we had a assault weapons ban? What is a assault weapon?
1347 2018-02-20 22:22:35 Only bump stocks?  We have a long way to go. 

Democrats tried to have a Bill to make bump stocks illegal but the Republicans refused to put the Bill on the Floor for a vote.
1348 2018-02-20 22:22:29 Breaking news, 
Trump signs bill to ban bump stocks
1349 2018-02-20 22:22:24 @realDonaldTrump You're trying to ban bump stocks? They work w/ 1 trigger pull, 1 round fired (legal). What's next? Banning trigger fingers?
1350 2018-02-20 22:22:20 So this is really a handgun issue. IMO that’s a more complicated discussion (debate), whereas assault rifles, bump stocks and large magazine clips shouldn’t be.
1351 2018-02-20 22:22:20 @MarkArum the move Trump really does nothing. No one really knew of bump stocks b4 vegas. This move wouldn't have prevented any school shooting
1352 2018-02-20 22:22:20 . @PressSec said "The president doesn't support the use of bump stocks." Not that he thinks bump stocks should be banned, just that he doesn't support their use. He himself later addressed the issue, but her syntax is just so horrific and another manifestation of her incompetence
1353 2018-02-20 22:22:19 lol
1354 2018-02-20 22:22:07 Small tweak, for sure. But also don’t forget bump stocks made Las Vegas massacre happen. Any port in the storm, right now.
1355 2018-02-20 22:22:03 Sales of Bump Stocks just went through the roof today
1356 2018-02-20 22:22:02 Bump stocks tend to make the gun jam fairly quick . This is not a real problem
1357 2018-02-20 22:21:59 "President Donald Trump announced that he wants the Justice Department to issue regulations that would declare so-called bump stocks illegal."
Bump stocks were used by the Vegas killer.Trump was president then.Not Obama
1358 2018-02-20 22:21:44 @tedlieu Can a president order DOJ to ban bump stocks? Wouldn't that need to be legislated first?
1359 2018-02-20 22:21:36 How fast are the LIBTARDS going to criticize Trump for ordering the BUMP STOCKS TO BE BANNED. I say by 2 nite
1360 2018-02-20 22:21:34 Most ppl using them have no clue how to accurately engage targets with Automatic fire, let alone w a make shift device. Now if you're trained & have an actual liscensed full Auto we can discuss it. 

But as for Bump stocks I have no love. 2x
1361 2018-02-20 22:21:23 That is what he says today. Tomorrow, he will deny that he ever said he ordered regulations to ban "bump stocks". We have a nut in charge of the country.
1362 2018-02-20 22:21:21 It is noteworthy that it's been over 4.5 months since the #LasVegasShooting, & only after the #ParklandShooting does he come out & say they've been working on the Bump Stocks issue &, low & behold, NOW they're banned, AFTER give people time to scramble & buy them before the ban.
1363 2018-02-20 22:21:19 Bump stocks are legal and I understand why. I guess they’re cool to use at the range but I’ve never liked them, however.
1364 2018-02-20 22:21:14 I imagine the FBI actually responding to the information on him might have helped though. I support gun control, but let's be honest here, none of the things you're proposing would have stopped him either. High capacity mags, bump stocks, assault rifles, all meaningless
1365 2018-02-20 22:21:09 Via @TwitterMoments: Trump has asked Attorney General Sessions to propose a ban on bump stocks, the legal device used in the Las Vegas shooting. #guncontrol #momlife 
1366 2018-02-20 22:21:09 @realDonaldTrump seriously,  banning pump stocks?  very disappointed you are caving to pressure.   No matter what you do it will not please lberals. please quit trying too
1367 2018-02-20 22:21:06 Lord Praise Supreme leader Donald Trump and his call for banning of bump stocks. We are not worthy of his greatness and compassion 
1368 2018-02-20 22:21:01 First step: ban bump stocks
Second: Restrict access
Third: Ban guns in public

Result: 20000 Americans survive every year
#NeverAgain #NRAKills
1369 2018-02-20 22:20:58 Completely disagree with @POTUS on this. Bump stocks are not worth the money. They do not make a rifle full auto! Most civilian ARs are not designed to fire full auto. This makes them very prone to jamming when a bump stocks briefly increase the rate of fire.
1370 2018-02-20 22:20:54 heureusement que je fais des 3 stocks contre KB sinon les matchs seraient tellement rapides
1371 2018-02-20 22:20:47 What’s your point  You like bump stocks or getting your stock bumped 
1372 2018-02-20 22:20:37 I think Trump's order to ban bump stocks is the single most restrictive gun regulation put in place since the assault weapons ban of 1994. Am I wrong?
1373 2018-02-20 22:20:36 Eliminate bump stocks now.
1374 2018-02-20 22:20:31 Bump stocks wre not even used in #Parkland. Like the rest of Trump's policies, it's useless at best.
1375 2018-02-20 22:20:27 Look on the bright side- if Trump wants to outlaw bump stocks, re-instate assault weapons ban, create 30 day waiting period, age requirements with mandatory gun training and licensing and gun registration for tracking lost / stolen weapons. He can brag BIGLY & I’m OK with it.
1376 2018-02-20 22:20:20 the NRA should not be against this i personally thing bump stocks are stupid they have nothing to do with marksmanship give terrible accuracy and are nothing but a gimmick i personally would not put one on my rifle
1377 2018-02-20 22:20:17 Someone is butthurt that they didn't get in on Bitcoin earlier...
1378 2018-02-20 22:20:16 Good to ban bump stocks, but I wonder how many AR-15s there are without bump stocks.
1379 2018-02-20 22:20:14 NYPD reports their highly trained officers hit the target 18% of the time. Not to mention first responders entering a school will shoot at anyone holding a gun. Background checks, ban bump stocks, make ammo $5 a round. Do something. Anything. Start somewhere.
1380 2018-02-20 22:20:12 Trump moves to ban 'bump stocks'
1381 2018-02-20 22:20:12 People have often asked me if I disagree with the President on anything.
Yes:
1. No tariffs (I think that he is selective tariffs on Chinese products is actually OK, though)
2. Delaying the repeal of DACA.
3. Banning bump stocks.
1382 2018-02-20 22:20:01 - Mass murderer uses bump stock to kill 58 people
- NRA offers bump stock as sacrificial lamb
- Public loses interest before anything is done
- Bump stocks put back in drawer for future use
- New mass shooting kills 17
- Trump picks up bump stock as token offer to appease masses
1383 2018-02-20 22:19:55 Obama admin approved bump stocks 2x. He also had more school shootings under his Presidency than any other President in history. Can you explain why when Obama was President & Democrats had control of the House & Senate they didn’t pass gun control legislation they demand today?
1384 2018-02-20 22:19:51 @chrisgeidner @gabrielmalor @ssamcham A bandaid. Bump stocks are just one accessory to simulate auto fire
1385 2018-02-20 22:19:48 The ATF under President Obama approved bump stocks and declared them legal to own.Since then over 50 people died in a mass shooting from a gunman using bump stocks. President Trump is going to make bump stock illegal. Democrats you may now begin spouting your lies & hypocrisies.
1386 2018-02-20 22:19:40 Donald Trump moves to ban Bump Stocks which is a GREAT step foward to reasonable gun control, but it is not enough. IF THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD IS NOT OLD/RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO DRINK BEER, THEY SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BUY AN AR-15 AS WELL.
1387 2018-02-20 22:19:38 I thought he said some bump stocks not all
1388 2018-02-20 22:19:37 is this the same idiot who sold all the stocks in his kids college account because @paulkrugman told him to?
1389 2018-02-20 22:19:33 There's nothing wrong with bump stocks. Period. You can do the same thing with just your finger. Are we going to regulate fingers now?
1390 2018-02-20 22:19:19 With all due respect, why didn’t he send a memo after the Las Vegas especially when Butt Stocks were used. Fast forward Feb 20. He has Sessions send a memo. This memo covers his ass. What is the chance of House and Senate pass a law banning Butt Stocks, Hope you are right.
1391 2018-02-20 22:19:16 Well back up a spell. A "Stock" is required on a rifle, & for accurately shooting a shotgun, so it isn't specific to Bump stocks. So it's different than a stabilizer. 

As for Bump stocks you bring one to my property to shoot & you'll never be back. I have no use for them. 1/
1392 2018-02-20 22:19:09 @MarkArum Bump stocks do not turn semi-automatic rifles into fully-auto. I do NOT want @potus to ban bump stocks. If the government ever turns against the people, the citizenry needs to be able to defend itself within reason. We don't have tanks, so bump stocks are reasonable.
1393 2018-02-20 22:19:08 #auspol #abcnews #GunLaws
#Trump announces inquiry into whether bump stocks are legal.
#POTUS has also signed a Memorandum for change.

(Definitely, some sort of loosely clarified change will occur.)
1394 2018-02-20 22:19:05 Read the damn memo! It directs them to “ review comments and proceed .......” it doesn ‘t say “ ban” bump stocks!
1395 2018-02-20 22:19:05 True. But we can double fool him. Let him think we love him for this, get this passed, then go after NRA hard. I'm serious. Get bump stocks out, it's a start.
1396 2018-02-20 22:19:04 Whys Trump just come out this morning and stated they're going to outlaw bump stocks then? Excellent move.
1397 2018-02-20 22:19:01 monopolies make for good stocks, but terrible for society. i live with my decision just fine...
1398 2018-02-20 22:18:59 Doesn’t Jr have shares in selling bump stocks?
1399 2018-02-20 22:18:54 Key word is "almost". I'm actually up in the air about bump stocks, but calling a weapon automatic when you put a bump stock on it just isn't true.
1400 2018-02-20 22:18:53 You do realize BHO nor Killary is the president, right? Since Trump crushed Kankles our stocks and economy have shot up, illegals entering has gone down, companies are returning with more jobs, food stamps/welfare needs going down, better constitutional judges selected, etc...
1401 2018-02-20 22:18:47 im pretty sure he's not done a single 'good' thing for america.  not one.. oh wait., he did announce he's banning bump stocks. but he isn't reporting they're coming out with "nudge" (predicted)  stocks.. say thing diff name but donny can claim he is so good.
1402 2018-02-20 22:18:44 Can we now see a photo of him FIRST signing? The one he did for the NRA so guns wouldn't be kept from mentally ill persons? When can we see it?

RT @NPR: President Trump says that he has signed a memo directing the Department of Justice to develop regulations to ban bump stocks.
1403 2018-02-20 22:18:37 I don't think banning bump stocks is a great solution, but if it makes the left happy, it's better than an assault rifle ban
1404 2018-02-20 22:18:33 I don’t really care one way or the other about Bump Stocks. Trump signing just means another step towards a total ban
1405 2018-02-20 22:18:32 While I do think it’s too little too late, a ban on bump stocks is what should have been done. An add-on to any type of product should never allow something legal to become illegal. This loophole shutdown needs to be approved and put in place immediately, and that is only step 1
1406 2018-02-20 22:18:26 Sorry Ass, is bump stocks the best you can do?
1407 2018-02-20 22:18:16 I’m not a gun guy though I am a constitutionalist and believe in the 2A. However I see absolutely no need for bump stocks.
1408 2018-02-20 22:18:16 Bump stocks are shit anyway lol I can mag dump wayyy faster without one
1409 2018-02-20 22:18:11 Bump stocks are not the issues. Even guns by themselves are not the issue. Backgroun checks are. Waiting periods are. Mental checks are. Mandatory trainings are. Mandatory licenses. Mandatory gun safes are.
1410 2018-02-20 22:18:10 @realDonaldTrump OK, your ban on bump stocks is the right thing. Thank you.
1411 2018-02-20 22:18:05 NRA has given DT the OK to ban bump stocks, that is not enough.  Simi automatic assault weapons are the issues.  Don't be fooled by DT's disingenuous attempt to make political points. This is a sham!!!
1412 2018-02-20 22:18:05 bump stocks is the @NRA throwing in a useless bargaining chip. They don’t want to lose on anything ever, and they rarely do. But in truth, they’ll take this loss cause it means nothing to them.

Op Ed after Vegas concert because:
1414 2018-02-20 22:18:03 Despite my overtly pro-gun leftism, I don't personally care much for bumpfire stocks, so the ensuing MAGA chud diaper-filling on social media in response to Trump's EO today effectively banning them is, uh, beautiful Schadenfreude.
1415 2018-02-20 22:17:59 Other than bump stocks, what else? I couldn't care less if bump stocks are banned.
1416 2018-02-20 22:17:58 Trump moves to ban Bump Stocks
1417 2018-02-20 22:17:58 Trump pushes ban on 'bump stocks' — devices that turn weapons into 'machine guns' and minimum age
1418 2018-02-20 22:17:57 Great, except... bump stocks was so two mass shootings ago. It’s hard to keep them all straight, I know, but the Florida shooter didn’t use a bump stock. He used a plain old AR-15. If you want to take remedial action, start by banning the purchase of semi-automatic weapons.
1419 2018-02-20 22:17:54 I don't know about the frequency of bump stocks in mass murders, either. It's really the platform of course, and most semiautomatics on the market today can be modified to fire automatically by removing a part or two.
1420 2018-02-20 22:17:53 So trump only wants to ban bump stocks instead of banning the AK
1421 2018-02-20 22:17:53 Wow. DT, after almost 5 months, is asking the Atty Gen. to do something about “bump stocks” used by the Las Vegas killer. Does he know that is NOT what the FL killer used? He used an ASSAULT RIFLE. How about legislation banning those? Only reason he is for that is NRA was ok w/it
1422 2018-02-20 22:17:49 According to CNN, Trump supports the ban of bump stocks, the device allowing semi-auto rifles to mimic auto fire. His haters though won’t even care. Any actions by him, any words, anything just isn’t good enough for the blind haters 
1423 2018-02-20 22:17:48 no Bump stocks  it is NOT going to stop Mass Shooting and is what should have already been done.
1424 2018-02-20 22:17:42 I'm by no means anti-second amendment. I went through hunter saftey and classes on gun safety in general. I served in the military. Hell, I've got a 9mm handgun just for home safety. But when it comes to bump stocks, semi autos, etc...
1425 2018-02-20 22:17:40 President Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks.....with one stroke he has done more for gun control than Obama did in eight years...
1426 2018-02-20 22:17:39 Whether it did or not, there's really no reason for assault weapons to be owned by citizens. I'm the first person to support gun ownership and feel that it's our right and privilege to bare arms, but that doesn't mean I think everything should be legal, such as bump stocks.
1427 2018-02-20 22:17:36 This presidential memorandum on bump stocks looks like it was written in haste:

(1) It's largely written in the first person. I count seven first-person pronouns in six paragraphs.
1428 2018-02-20 22:17:35 Why do we need bump stocks ? For the same reason the police, military, and criminals use it.Why do we need nukes? Why do we need bullet proof vest for the police or bullet proof glass in banks and gas stations?why? Even Unicorns have an offensive and defensive weapon, it's Horn.
1429 2018-02-20 22:17:30 @BandaiNamcoFR ...(2) sans tomber sur les enfants de pute qui vont les revendre 3 fois leur prix dès le 24/02. C'est quand même incroyable que même VOUS n'ayez pas les stocks conséquents pour honorer l'ensemble des commandes...(3)
1430 2018-02-20 22:17:27 I agree that banning bump stocks will save lives. So will renewing the assault weapons ban. #GunReformNow #MarchForOurLives #NotOneMore
1431 2018-02-20 22:17:18 Bump stocks aren't a device that turns legal weapons into machine-guns b/c they do not alter a gun's internal mechanisms. The ATF would have to change the way it interpreted the National Firearms Act or issue new legislation allowing bump stocks 2 B regulated. (Per @PolitiFact )
1432 2018-02-20 22:17:17 He is a too late with the “bump stocks”disapproval ... it is time now for the latest shooting... u need a license to drive a car but no one needs to ask u why u are buying a semi automatic #ParklandSchoolShooting #potus #StudentsDemandAction #whenit happenstoyou
1433 2018-02-20 22:17:14 Can #DonTheCon sell more guns than #obama ? Competition starts today with bump stocks
1434 2018-02-20 22:17:14 Trump probably thinks stocks are shares. He’s that dense.
1435 2018-02-20 22:17:13 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump No half measures on gun control. Bump stocks and background checks are necessary but not sufficient. A 19 year-old should not be able to buy an AR-15. Period. Anything less is evidence of corruption: you've been bought by the NRA.
1436 2018-02-20 22:17:12 Trump has proposed a ban on bump stocks FIVE months after the Las Vegas massacre. Perhaps in other FIVE months, after a few more massacres, and a lot more funerals for children, he'll just get smart about it and propose a ban on assault weapons altogether.
1437 2018-02-20 22:16:54 I can't see why anyone would NOT want to ban Bump Stocks .  You'd have to be an absolutely gun FANATIC to think those things should be legal.  #GunReformNow #GunContolNow
1438 2018-02-20 22:16:54 Trump has suggested a ban on bump stocks being sold to the mentally ill on months containing an R, every third leap year. 
A White House spokesperson said, "It's the least he can do... literally, the least thing that the NRA would agree to."
 #bumpstocks
1439 2018-02-20 22:16:51 I will give Trump 1% credit for banning bump stocks. However, NRA approved the ban back in OCT. He could have banned them any time. But he did it the same day FLA Senate voted down further conversation/legis on banning assault rifles. Let's focus on FLA.
1440 2018-02-20 22:16:49 Bump stocks aren't a device that turns legal weapons into machine-guns b/c they do not alter a gun's internal mechanisms. The ATF would have to change the way it interpreted the National Firearms Act or issue new legislation allowing bump stocks 2 B regulated. (Per @PolitiFact )
1441 2018-02-20 22:16:49 Expected need to make it pay to ban them. Right now it pays not to ban them. Sending down gun manufacturer prices will change the narritive. How? Institutional selling Go look thru your 401k ret plans mutual funds and see what stocks are in there.
1442 2018-02-20 22:16:45 Same thing happened in AZ today where the R's voted to not even debate outlawing bump stocks in their state. That vote was ongoing as Trump said he wanted that done federally.
1443 2018-02-20 22:16:42 Remember that Trump is a baby so we should praise him excessively if he actually does something about bump stocks or sensible gun regulation. A step in the right direction is a good thing, even when Trump is the one who is doing the stepping.
1444 2018-02-20 22:16:40 What a concession...The problem is far deeper than bump stocks...And why now.  Why not the day after the Las Vegas shooting?
1445 2018-02-20 22:16:39 President does not have the authority to ban bump stocks. That requires a law from Congress. Machine guns have a very specific definition and bump stocks are not machine guns
1446 2018-02-20 22:16:29 I knew this was coming but shocked that Trump would do it. Bump stocks should be discussed but one person BANNING any gun should not be the way. I didn't like it when Obama did it or Clinton.
1447 2018-02-20 22:16:22 Also, I’m sure there’s a criminal somewhere who’s thinking: Shoot! Bump stocks are not allowed anymore. This will complicate things when I want to go out there and shoot a bunch of people. Ridiculous.
1448 2018-02-20 22:16:15 Send me that best stocks shit you wrote up bro
1449 2018-02-20 22:16:11 And said trump signed a memorandum to look into banning bump stocks!!! Not I am signing a bill to ban them!!! Wtf!! Still nothing!!
1450 2018-02-20 22:16:04 totally agree-good job, good decision Trump-let's hope that a law banning bump stocks doesn't get caught up in any legal mess
1451 2018-02-20 22:16:02 Banning bump stocks will not solve anything. It changes the rate of fire slightly any able-bodied shooter can still put out a tremendous rate of fire With an unmodified A.R. 15. We need stricter gun laws. But this is not the answer
1452 2018-02-20 22:16:01 Good move by Trump on bump stocks. You can still possess the gun, just not fire it as quickly.
1453 2018-02-20 22:15:59 Bravo.  No bump stocks.  No mentally ill with access to guns, a conversation about violent people killing vidio games and the breakdown of the family.  Gun control is a knee jerk reaction.
1454 2018-02-20 22:15:59 @realDonaldTrump a ban on bump stocks?  That's it?  Sure it is a start, but I doubt it will do any good because the NRA will not let their congress pass it.  You can do better, well I think you can.
1455 2018-02-20 22:15:51 hey remember those bump stocks we were going to ban? yeah, um. nothing
1456 2018-02-20 22:15:49 Yes...all this idiot needed to do was sign an Executive Order banning AR-15..Bump Stocks ,purchase a fire arm be 21..
1457 2018-02-20 22:15:48 Bump Stocks legislation is too little and too late. Voters need wipe out EVERY politician supported in ANY way by the NRA.
KILL THE NRA that put weapons of war in civilian hands and has caused mass murder of American citizens by voting out every NRA supported politician.
1458 2018-02-20 22:15:43 Different quality vix action now.. backwardation quite sticky despite some V shape action in stocks on the surface
1459 2018-02-20 22:15:42 No, it's not. He's testing the waters. If something is better than nothing, he gets to be the hero and keep his blood money. There was a bill to ban bump stocks. What happened with that?
1460 2018-02-20 22:15:33 I own a semi-auto AR. Have owned semi-auto AK’s. Would like another AK. Never have I considered a bump stock necessary. It is a loop hole. Hate if ya want, I believe the #2ndAmendment protects all others but bump stocks...really? - DC
1461 2018-02-20 22:15:30 After the latest massacre, Trump now favors a ban on bump-stocks (that was six mass-murders ago, dude.) I wonder how many more school massacres it will take to ban assault weapons?
1462 2018-02-20 22:15:29 If Trump is banning bump stocks then Battlefield 1 should nerf the rate of fire on the Fedorov Avtomat
1463 2018-02-20 22:15:25 How magnanimous of Trump. He “directed” an action that the NRA doesn’t oppose. What a show of courage. 
Banning bump stocks is good but not nearly enough. #GunReformNow
1464 2018-02-20 22:15:21 I guess now is the time to talk about bump stocks?
1465 2018-02-20 22:15:04 Trump asks justice departments to ban bump stocks and other gun modifications. Good trump.
1466 2018-02-20 22:15:02 I take it ur not happy about bump stocks?
1467 2018-02-20 22:14:58 Just curious. Is there anyone who doesn’t agree w/the following, (they’re no-brainers to me)? Why?

- You need to pass a background check to buy a gun. Anywhere.

- Outlaw bump stocks. If automatics are illegal, how can anything that turns a semi-automatic into an auto be legal?
1468 2018-02-20 22:14:51 Trump dit vouloir bannir les “bump stocks”, qui permettent de tirer en rafale. Cela ne lui coûte rien politiquement (la NRA approuve). À noter que le  tueur de Parkland ne s’est pas servi de cet accessoire.
1469 2018-02-20 22:14:49 Let's hand our guns over to people who covered up Hillary's criminality, overlooked the sale of U.S. Uranium to Russia, tried to frame Trump with a fraudulent dossier and dropped the ball on all mass shootings.

We'll all be safer

Bump Stocks
1470 2018-02-20 22:14:49 bump stocks were not an issue with the last potus, hell, most people had no idea what they were before Vagus.  The last potus tried to deal with the mental issues, but the current potus removed that by EO.  Also, this new order is a review, and make suggestions, nothing more.
1471 2018-02-20 22:14:48 FYI Trump: "bump stocks" are already banned* in Denver!
1472 2018-02-20 22:14:46 No! Bump stocks don't kill people. People kill people. How far should we take this madness? What we need to do is protect our schools/churches and stop pretending there will be no more bad guys who want to shoot up a school or church.
1473 2018-02-20 22:14:40 OMG is @realDonaldTrump going to actually do something to support sensible gun reform? He asked the AG to call a review to ban bump stocks & invited families of Sandy Hook and Parkland to the WH to discuss gun safety.  Please, please let this be the start of something real.
1474 2018-02-20 22:14:31 Donald signed a memorandum directing the attorney general to look into the issue of banding bump stocks, he didn’t actually tell them to do anything! More smoke and mirrors from demented Donald
1475 2018-02-20 22:14:23 Gun shop owners working late tonight repricing bump stocks to make more money tomorrow when for the 2nd time (right after Vegas massacre) they'll be mad rush to buy them. WINNING
1476 2018-02-20 22:14:21 Trump has merely directed that steps be taken toward considering a ban on bump stocks. It takes a normal human about 5 secs to realise that was the right step after Las Vegas, not 5 months. It's your assertion that it was timely that is so bizarre.
1477 2018-02-20 22:14:18 God bless our president! I am so thankful for him and will support what he does. I am; however, for the first time disappointed in him that he has approved making bump stocks or anything that makes a gun automatic illegal. Big win for the liberals. The ball is rolling now.
1478 2018-02-20 22:14:18 While Trump's token gesture of banning bump-stocks is pretty much worthless, it is *so* entertaining to watch his supporters "debating" the topic amongst themselves on here.
1479 2018-02-20 22:14:14 Except he lacks the legal authority to do so.  Bump stocks are not NFA items.
1480 2018-02-20 22:14:10 Bump stocks addresses 10% of one mass shooting from months ago. True it's something but only a token that won't pass through Ryan's House
1481 2018-02-20 22:14:07 How about that President being advised by the likes of the three stooges and me old pal Ed Nevins. A couple of months after Massachusetts banned bump stocks and out Republican Governor signed legislation, fast Eddie and his pals are on the case.
1482 2018-02-20 22:14:00 Not convinced you’ll get the bump stocks. Just an appeasement to the fraud gun control movement.
1483 2018-02-20 22:14:00 Just to clear things up...you're angry that he's making a move to ban bump stocks
1484 2018-02-20 22:13:57 Yeah, that will help. Damn bump stocks. If it wasn't for those we wouldn't have mental illness or a decay in basic moral fabric. Get a f***** clue already. It's not quantum physics.
1485 2018-02-20 22:13:54 @cameron_kasky Trump just announced that he is going to make bump stocks illegal, which were used in Vegas, not at your school. This is a clear case of giving you crumbs instead of the whole muffin. I call BS on Trump...Should have been done right after the Vegas shooting. Thanks
1486 2018-02-20 22:13:53 If u want to stop madness u give on things that won't change 2A. We don't allow machine guns. Bump stocks can go.
1487 2018-02-20 22:13:47 Except the Justice Dept said months ago (post LV shooting) that it has no power to regulate bump stocks without congressional action so it’s just more lip service. He’s not going to do a damn thing.
1488 2018-02-20 22:13:41 Let me guess... he believes every school in America should have concealed carry for teachers and students and bump stocks should be leagal
1489 2018-02-20 22:13:40 @newtgingrich What rock did you crawl out from under Newt?So U want too put guns in our schools?The Long term solution is 2 ban the sale of assault weapons and bump stocks, thorough background checks n renew the Obama exec order barring people with mental issues from having guns!
1490 2018-02-20 22:13:37 He needs a law from Congress to do this. Machine guns have a very specific definition and bump stocks are not machine guns.
1491 2018-02-20 22:13:36 This is one of those ‘gimmes’ in politics. A very small portion of the gun community cares about bump stocks, so it’s easy to ban them. I think those that use them are dense. 
1492 2018-02-20 22:13:34 Well, it's my understanding that a bill to ban bump-stocks was quickly introduced after LV, but the Dems then loaded it up with a lot of other anti-gun measures, causing it to die.
1493 2018-02-20 22:13:31 You're an idiot @ASavageNation. The AR-15 is not a machine gun and those are illegal. Banning bump stocks aren't going to do anything to secure our schools. It's a useless feel good measure and once again we can't provide security for our children.
1494 2018-02-20 22:13:23 This is what amounts as "action" by the Trump White House: issuing a memo to the AG to hurry up with a rule making process started in December, to look at reclassifying bump stocks. Why not just get Congress to pass a law outlawing bump stocks? 1/
1495 2018-02-20 22:13:19 Too little, too late. Regulations on bump-stocks is not enough.
1496 2018-02-20 22:13:17 @realDonaldTrump WTF Mr. President? A ban on bump stocks? You know damn well it won’t end there with liberal idiots. Keep this up and I won’t be voting for you in 2020. #nobumpstockban #2A #SecondAmendment #disappointed
1497 2018-02-20 22:13:16 @JoyAnnReid  Hey Joy  question for you with Trump saying he wants Bump Stocks banned don’t you think it just a move thinking that will stop the kids from doing what their doing?Its what i believe is his motive i could be wrong but we need way more then that! Your thoughts please?
1498 2018-02-20 22:13:05 Trump asking to ban bump stocks is like throwing one Skittle at a starving person.

It’s not even scratching the surface in terms of what needs to happen to protect America from gun violence.

If he thinks just this small tweak will pacify us he is mistaken.
1499 2018-02-20 22:13:01 @SymsForAZ Extremely dismayed that you are an aficionada of bump stocks per your vote today. And yet you call yourself pro-life?
1500 2018-02-20 22:13:00 I am a winner I am blessed I am beautiful I am highly intelligent I am well educated I am strong I am spiritually full I sexy I am young I am happy I am grateful I am stocks I am bonds I am love I am wealth I am healthy I am a spiritual seer I am a straight A student I AM LOVE
1501 2018-02-20 22:12:57 If we’re banning bump stocks because they “can” make a deadly weapon even deadlier...shouldn’t we just go ahead and do something about the already deadly AR-15???
1502 2018-02-20 22:12:56 Wow @realDonaldTrump . That’s really jumping on it. How many months ago were we talking about getting rid of bump stocks. So, Cadet Bone Spurs, how about getting rid of assault rifles?
Would the NRA make you give back the $21 million they gave your campaign?
1503 2018-02-20 22:12:41 The Florida shooter was a practiced marksman that took single, well-placed shots (which is what most shooters would prefer), so let's fire up the "Ban bump stocks" argument again, and forget about providing armed guards at schools and other sensible measures
1504 2018-02-20 22:12:39 Bump Stocks are legal.
1505 2018-02-20 22:12:33 Banning bump stocks is beating around the bushes. No talks about banning AR-15s and other type of auto-riffles, so people can continue to go shopping for these and kill more Americans.
1506 2018-02-20 22:12:30 @JoyAnnReid @DavidCornDC  Interesting that now Trumps orders the DOJ to ban bump stocks.  Is it over concern for innocent gun victims or about hoping to redirect the attention of those he perceives as enemies?
1507 2018-02-20 22:12:28 NRA has given DT the OK to ban bump stocks, that is not enough.  Simi automatic assault weapons are the issues.  Don't be fooled by DT's disingenuous attempt to make political points. This is a sham!!!
1508 2018-02-20 22:12:26 Banning bump stocks is a great move but the AR-15 used in #FloridaSchoolShooting was not modified.

If Trump wants to really make a difference, AR-15s must be banned. He should set up a buyback program to pull them out of circulation.
1509 2018-02-20 22:12:25 Do not think POTUS should have ordered banning bump stocks !!! Camel's nose in the tent !!!!
1510 2018-02-20 22:12:18 I had a feeling bump stocks would be the next device to be sacrificed in name of “common sense” gun control.
1511 2018-02-20 22:12:17 It's am "assault style" rifle. Who cares. Look at the damage it's done. BAN ALL ASSAULT STYLE RIFLES, HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES, AND ALL BUMP STOCKS. So simple.
1512 2018-02-20 22:12:06 Happy Birthday. Bump stocks, thoughts and prayers from the POTUS.
1513 2018-02-20 22:12:05 People can get pissed at me if they wanna but the “bump stocks” seem to be a loophole. I don’t care if they’re banned. Leave weapons alone, better measures to prevent as many bad guys as you can WITHOUT touching the #2ndAmendment - DC
1514 2018-02-20 22:12:04 Market Close: MBS -6bps; DOW -254.63; NASDAQ -5.16; S&P 500 -15.96; 10yr Treasury 2.89%; Stocks declined further as the day went along, and the investors moved their funds into MBS (closed off of earlier lows), as the 2yr Treasury Auction went well.
1515 2018-02-20 22:12:04 I mean...it’s not a bad thing for a President to do. He’s discussed background checks and bump stocks. Let’s see what happens. Probably nothing, but I can’t criticize him for this. If Obamacare did it, we’d be applauding him.
1516 2018-02-20 22:11:56 1. This is a good first step
2. But first of many

Trump directs Attorney General Sessions to propose regulations to ban ‘bump stocks’ - The Washington Posthttps://apple.news/AdurbBiJzQwKTFPHFxkCs3A
1517 2018-02-20 22:11:49 You're such a douche. He just endorsed a ban on bump stocks and you come out with this nonsense 
1518 2018-02-20 22:11:43 The DOJ in Dec. said they needed congressional action to ban bump stocks. Why don't you make a demand on Congress to take immediate action? GOP won't do it.
1519 2018-02-20 22:11:37 @realDonaldTrump, thanks for requesting the ban on bump stocks.  Well done.
1520 2018-02-20 22:11:36 Bump stocks don't mean anything without an assault rifle.
1521 2018-02-20 22:11:34 So with bump stocks banned and binary triggers banned, what do you think will come next?
1522 2018-02-20 22:11:34 The correlation between rates and stocks is all over the place... rates, viewed in isolation, not a good way to assess stock market odds.
1523 2018-02-20 22:11:33 @realDonaldTrump I hope you realize how many supporters and votes you lost using an executive order to ban Bump Stocks. You're no better than a liberal to me now. I'll just stay home voting day. Also I won't be voting for any midterm RINOS that support more gun laws either.
1524 2018-02-20 22:11:29 The memo specifically states "machinegun" which already has a legal definition. Basically multiple rounds per trigger pull. Bump stocks increase the amount of trigger pulls not the bullets. So in the end this is going to do nothing.
1525 2018-02-20 22:11:28 I applaud you Mr. President for outlawing bump stocks! If you can turn these shootings around and enact gun control then you legit may have won my vote
1526 2018-02-20 22:11:26 If there was no school shooting TRUMP the bump stocks would still be for sale, he should had  ban them right after the Vegas shooting, hell this kid did not use bump stock, this is his way of trying to look like he is doing something.
1527 2018-02-20 22:11:25 @realDonaldTrump FINALLY taking steps to ban bump stocks used by white make that slaughtered 60 injured 500 in Las Vegas last October.
1528 2018-02-20 22:11:19 The NRA shares the same stance on bump stocks.... So..... No.
1529 2018-02-20 22:11:18 President Trump is recommending to Attorney General Sessions to ban bump stocks. Obama made them legal.
1530 2018-02-20 22:11:15 The Obama admin approved the sale of bump stocks. Trump is just reversing another failed Obama policy.
1531 2018-02-20 22:11:14 While this is a start, it's not enough!  Bump Stocks weren't used in the Parkdale mass shooting.  We need to push for complete ban on automatic weapons, starting with assault rifles.  Not just bump stocks!  The Virginia Tech student used automatic pistols!
1532 2018-02-20 22:10:57 Let’s see.   Trump signs EO on bump stocks and now Jeffy starts a cyber task force.   A little bit too late on both accounts
1533 2018-02-20 22:10:52 Although bump stocks don’t technically make a gun full auto, they do increase firing rate and make them impossible to aim properly. Obama should not have allowed them in the first place. 

Any other conversion devices should be banned as well. It’s a reasonable position.
1534 2018-02-20 22:10:48 Breaking: President Trump to pass some gun regulations, including banning bump stocks. This will make Schumer and Democrats very angry (they didn't really want to pass this stuff, they'd rather use it as an election issue.)
1535 2018-02-20 22:10:39 Ban bump stocks!!! You need more than that@realDonaldTrump
1536 2018-02-20 22:10:27 Bump-stocks. They accomplish the same thing if accuracy isn't an issue. @GOP refuses to even consider banning those. Care to comment on that?
1537 2018-02-20 22:10:27 You are attacking your base by banning bump stocks. The people will remember.
1538 2018-02-20 22:10:24 Banning bump stocks? Um... Okay
1539 2018-02-20 22:10:22 Breaking: President Trump to pass some gun regulations, including banning bump stocks. This will make Schumer and Democrats very angry (they didn't really want to pass this stuff, they'd rather use it as an election issue.)
1540 2018-02-20 22:10:20 Trump ordering Sessions to ban bump stocks would’ve been great if only he had done so after the Vegas shooting. Better late than never. But now is the time to talk about banning assault weapons and reinstating the ban on selling guns to people with mental health issues.
1541 2018-02-20 22:10:17 @realDonaldTrump thank you sir for recommending a ban on bump stocks. Very much appreciated.
1542 2018-02-20 22:10:15 BLM is protest organization that doesn’t have offices or lobbies, The NRA is an organization with various conventions, offices, buildings and stocks in gun companies...huge difference there
1543 2018-02-20 22:10:14 While rare I do agree with Trump on some issues. Banning bump stocks is one of them, and it’s good to see common sense gun legislation. #CommonSenseGunLaws
1544 2018-02-20 22:10:14 What he said was “propose regulations on banning bump stocks or other devices that make legal guns automatic”. Ar15 is a legal weapon, unfortunately.
1545 2018-02-20 22:10:13 Ok @realDonaldTrump I’ll give you credit for directing the AG to do something about bump stocks, 4 months and a mass shooting after the fact. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another 4 months and a mass shooting for you to do something about assault weapons (AR 15)!
1546 2018-02-20 22:10:13 @realDonaldTrump Bump stocks,thoughts and prayers, you really are terrific.
1547 2018-02-20 22:10:11 Sooooooo I thought bump stocks didn't make a difference 6 mo. ago 
1548 2018-02-20 22:10:11 No real need for bump stocks anyway. Entertainment value only for some plinkers. Anything else would be for  nefarious reasons anyway. No other gun laws needed. No bans.
1549 2018-02-20 22:10:11 The top five stocks that fell today were $WMT, $GPC, $GPS, $SIG, and $KR.
1550 2018-02-20 22:10:09 Breaking: President Trump to pass some gun regulations, including banning bump stocks. This will make Schumer and Democrats very angry (they didn't really want to pass this stuff, they'd rather use it as an election issue.)
1551 2018-02-20 22:10:09 Slowlyy learning the stock trade.... keyword “slowly”  got an E-Mail saying they need a response from me regarding corporate action and what’d I’d like to do w my Stocks. Eeee I’m so excited 
1552 2018-02-20 22:10:07 It's a shame Obama thought bump stocks were lawful to own. Well at least now we have clarity.
1553 2018-02-20 22:09:58 Yep. Only used in Vegas. Apparently there are ways to DIY bump stocks too.
1554 2018-02-20 22:09:58 LOL, "gun owner" talking about bump stocks.
1555 2018-02-20 22:09:57 Did the NRA allow the Donald to ban bump stocks?  Is DJT breaking from NRA?  Am I missing something?
1556 2018-02-20 22:09:46 Do you think they will want to keep talking gun control after they ban bump stocks?
1557 2018-02-20 22:09:46 It is more than bump stocks you jerk
1558 2018-02-20 22:09:45 fuck your bump stocks mayne your politics are a joke fuck your country your future is shiite
1559 2018-02-20 22:09:44 @NRA @NRATV @ChrisCoxNRA if bump stocks get regulated- prepare to get replaced by the @GunOwners!!!! Cody Wilson is right about the NRA being pro-gun Control!!!!!!
1560 2018-02-20 22:09:42 The top five stocks that gained today were $NBL, $MOS, $KMG, $QRVO, and $CF.
1561 2018-02-20 22:09:41 Bump stocks are a gimmicky silly thing. No serious combatant would ever use one - even against a tyrannical govt.
1562 2018-02-20 22:09:38 President Donald Trump banning of BUMP STOCKS during an NRA-ILA rally by mere speech makes total nonsense, where is the signed bill to follow it up after the NRA spend about $30million to sponsor Trump's campaign in 2016.
     Mr Trump who is fooling who? You are fooling yourself
1563 2018-02-20 22:09:37 Trump orders ban on Bump stocks. Great move. Now will congress implement?
1564 2018-02-20 22:09:37 I love how they think this delayed token response will cut it. We are so far beyond bump stocks now.
1565 2018-02-20 22:09:36 Not much, and meant to fore grip. harder to control if someone does 3D print the bump stock, but wouldn't hurt my feelings if it's not banned. Bump stocks is a good move.
1566 2018-02-20 22:09:21 BREAKING: President Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks used in Las Vegas massacre.
1567 2018-02-20 22:09:14 His Rumpness' direction to the DOJ on bump stocks is a first step.  But that's all it is.  One step.  There's so much more to do after that. #GunReformNow
1568 2018-02-20 22:09:11 He signed a memo. It's not like he signed an EO or had Congress draft a law against bump stocks. He only signed a memo.
1569 2018-02-20 22:09:08 @realDonaldTrump Don't fall for the lies about gun control. Don't move towards more regulation with things like bump stocks. If you want to save lives place armed guards in schools to protect the kids!
1570 2018-02-20 22:09:07 The top five most active stocks today were $GE, $BAC, $WMT, $AMD, and $MU.
1571 2018-02-20 22:08:44 Dear @realDonaldTrump 
My stocks dropped significantly today...again...now do I blame you or Obama?
1572 2018-02-20 22:08:41 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Mr. President. What do people that already own bump-stocks and haven't killed anyone do with their stocks? You plan on compensating them for paying $600 for a novelty device that you caved to the whiny Liberals and banned? Frivolous legislation.
1573 2018-02-20 22:08:40 The Obama administration repeatedly claimed bump stocks were legal to purchase?!
1574 2018-02-20 22:08:37 Teachers dying and parents losing kids? To think that this movement should be discredited, in any way, is preposterous. (Bump stocks should have been banned after Vegas.) We're so behind now in addressing this issue it's disgusting. The NRA was so intractable it created this.
1575 2018-02-20 22:08:30 Very seldom is all the facts out there to be found. You don’t have all facts either.
1576 2018-02-20 22:08:27 More nonsense from Trump. Bump stocks really? They have nothing to do with nothing!
1577 2018-02-20 22:08:21 Was the DOJ statements regarding bump stocks? Or banning guns or putting restrictions in general?
1578 2018-02-20 22:08:17 .@realDonaldTrump your urge to ban bump stocks is a betrayal and infringement on the second amendment and a betrayal to your base!
1579 2018-02-20 22:08:12 It matters because it’s not a solution that will save lives in the overall problem of gun crime. AR15’s were used in just 2.2% of all gun crimes in the past 5 years. Bump stocks??? Probably less than .5%. How does this do anything????
1580 2018-02-20 22:08:11 Can the Cheeto order a ban on bump stocks or must legislation be voted on and signed?
1581 2018-02-20 22:08:05 Trump just asked AG to ban bump stocks, 1, 1.
1582 2018-02-20 22:08:02 I didn't say Cruz weapon was automatic as on military. However, it shots as fast as you can move your finger and pull the trigger. I know I've shot AR 15 Semi auto weapons. In 1 min you can get off dzs off rounds. Extended clips should be outlawed as well as bump stocks
1583 2018-02-20 22:07:58 I'd much prefer he'd ban the weapons that bump stocks are used on, therefore eliminating to even need/want that *accessory*. People will easily find a way to convert these weapons w/o bump stocks, but w/o the weapon...Btw, no bump stock used in Parkland.
1584 2018-02-20 22:07:54 I bet Trump asked NRA what they could live with as far as action on "gun violence" - they probably said - get rid of bump stocks. It will not have an impact on selling and marketing guns but the "optics" of doing something looks good! What a shit show!
1585 2018-02-20 22:07:51 NRA has given DT the OK to ban bump stocks, that is not enough.  Simi automatic assault weapons are the issues.  Don't be fooled by DT's disingenuous attempt to make political points. This is a sham!!!
1586 2018-02-20 22:07:44 Banning bump stocks is pointless! The gun can’t  fire more rounds than magazine can hold. & as far as speed, a semi-auto rifle &  pistol fire the same. Only as quick as one can squeeze the trigger.
1587 2018-02-20 22:07:43 never understood the fascination with bump stocks. I'm a long time NRA member and AR owner but never had a desire to own one.
1588 2018-02-20 22:07:43 The president today has taken action on bump stocks and we appalled the presidents quick action!
1589 2018-02-20 22:07:39 Very first thing Trump signed was a stand alone bill sponsored by @ChuckGrassley to undo Obama law aimed at preventing mentally ill from buying guns. So I'm not giving Cheeto Hitler any props on bump stocks until he corrects that mistake. #NRAwhores
1590 2018-02-20 22:07:37 Shouldn’t have gave Iran the money regardless. If it was Iran’s supposed Money , we shouid have kept it all. To hell with Iran.
1591 2018-02-20 22:07:36 No, he didn't. Read the quote. He never said they were banning Bump Stocks.
1592 2018-02-20 22:07:34 Funny. Bump stocks were only used in Vegas mass shooting. Yet bump stocks wasn't used in other mass shooting. Not in Texas or Florida. This is what is called doing very min to try and gain a maximum in the press.
1593 2018-02-20 22:07:32 Interesting that they didn't have a policy in their Investment Management Agreement that restricted Vice stocks.
1594 2018-02-20 22:07:29 I want to give the White House Press Corps signs in stocks that say BS and watch them hold them up every time Sarah Huckabee Sanders makes an untrue, incomplete or misleading statement. 
1595 2018-02-20 22:07:27 Congress can act on its own. Referring bump stocks to federal agency is being done to slow the process down.
1596 2018-02-20 22:07:23 You can live in dream land.  Leave people on earth alone.  Today he directed DOJ to ban bump stocks.  This week he called on congress to increase bkgrnd checks.  Remind me what the do nothing marxist did again?
1597 2018-02-20 22:07:20 Does the POTUS appear weak now that is want's to ban bump stocks?
1598 2018-02-20 22:07:19 Well errybody, if Drumpf hates bump stocks then we must love them now.
1599 2018-02-20 22:07:08 What you’re not mentioning is bump stocks greatly reduce the accuracy of the rifle even with a bipod. I can do far more damage without the bump stock then with it.
1600 2018-02-20 22:07:01 Congress can act on its own. Referring bump stocks to federal agency is being done to slow the process down.
1601 2018-02-20 22:07:01 PS: When you care about bump stocks and showing people how much you know about weaponry more than dead children, you don't sound smart or tough.

Join the military and shut up.
1602 2018-02-20 22:07:00 To propose regulations? What’s there to propose? Ban bump stocks. There it is Proposed.
1603 2018-02-20 22:06:55 @CNNPolitics @ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews @washingtonpost @nytimes @POTUS Banning bump stocks is only one thing that needs to be done. It should have been done already. All assault rifles should also be banned.
1604 2018-02-20 22:06:54 I'll make a compromise with you. You can keep bump stocks, and all other external modifications for firearms. And then we can legalize Plastic Explosives, Rocket Launchers, and Tanks. After all, the right to KEEP and BEAR arms shall not be infringed.

Why can't I have those?
1605 2018-02-20 22:06:54 .@VBTheWise In the wake of Trump’s bump stocks memorandum, can you find an accurate count of how many MA citizens turned in there bump stocks when banned here?
1606 2018-02-20 22:06:53 Bump stocks are garbage anyway.
1607 2018-02-20 22:06:52 *Trump, sounding more & more like Baldwin parody*:

I’m advising —
the Attorney General —
to propose legislation —against bump stocks. 
I’m so great.

ADVISING TO PROPOSE IS A CLASSIC SHELL GAME “NOTHING” MOVE
1608 2018-02-20 22:06:50 #RT President Trump says he has directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ban "bump stocks," devices that make it easier to fire rounds…
1609 2018-02-20 22:06:47 @realDonaldTrump ban bump stocks, lose my vote.
1610 2018-02-20 22:06:41 Look, we'll take it if Trump actually does something more than talk.  But Vegas massacre was 4 1/2 months ago.  Did Fox and Friends just get around to mentioning bump stocks now?
1611 2018-02-20 22:06:39 I don’t know a single gun owner that thinks Bump Stocks are a good idea. They aren’t practical and they are gimmicks, ban them, but these people are acting like every gun owner and their mother had bump stocks. Ur gunna hear zero complaints from 2A supporters.
1612 2018-02-20 22:06:25 Trump may have done the first thing correct as president, by directing his AG to ban Bump stocks. Still, not even close to enough, and I am still concerned that there will be no follow up
1613 2018-02-20 22:06:25 Why? 2A is still in effect, and bump stocks do not make weapons automatic.  We just take any orders to court. All good.
1614 2018-02-20 22:06:19 SO useless. There are YouTube videos showing gun obsessed people how to make their own bump stocks. This is completely useless, and means nothing to the NRA, not to mention zero impact for prevention of mass shootings like Parkland.
1615 2018-02-20 22:06:16 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS  it is UNCONSTITUTIONAL to ban bump stocks, ESPECIALLY the day after endorsing Mitt Romney!!!!  #no#on#ban #noRomney
1616 2018-02-20 22:06:12 #spinelessTrump talking about booming economy !! 
wait till gas prices rise to $4.00/gallon this summer - we are all doomed !!
Now Spineless is recommending banning bump stocks - well let us see how well it turns out!
1617 2018-02-20 22:06:01 Six months after an atrocity involving bump stocks he's directed the DOJ to contemplate bump stocks.
1) This DOJ is on record that it's Congress's job not theirs.
2) If they didn't look into six months ago, what's this memo supposed to do?
3) Everyone knows to ignore his bluster.
1618 2018-02-20 22:05:49 I am sad that Cuomo has had such s limited experience that he mistakes a  black semi-auto rifle with scope rails as a military weapon.

Little does he realize that new polymers have outdated the use of wood for many rifle stocks. Too bad those polymers are mostly black.
1619 2018-02-20 22:05:49 What about an Assault Weapons Ban along with this? Bump stocks change weapons, these weapons don't need to be changed.
1620 2018-02-20 22:05:47 So interesting that you had to wait for another massacre to make a token gesture and ban bump stocks...
1621 2018-02-20 22:05:42 I’m glad Trump is actually talking about banning bump stocks (for once he says something I can agree on) but it needs to go much further than that. It’s as if almost every week I am seeing senseless violence resulting in our ridiculous gun laws and it needs to end ASAP 
1622 2018-02-20 22:05:41 Translation of trump ax: NRA signed off on @POTUS offering up bump stocks as a one off intended to placate. The Parkland survivors will not be placated by a one off. Yes, bump stocks must go but they're just the tip of the long  overdue need for #GunReformNow. We MUSTto THEM...
1623 2018-02-20 22:05:34 Should we ban bump stocks?
1624 2018-02-20 22:05:34 tronochick NRA The NRA agreed there should be restrictions on bump stocks months ago...
1625 2018-02-20 22:05:33 Didn’t @TheRickWilson tell us rubber bands can do the same thing as bump stocks? Outlaw rubber bands! No. Outlaw semi-automatic rifles. And be specific - apparently “assault weapon” is too general a term to enact a ban.
1626 2018-02-20 22:05:32 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, The ban on bump stocks is a start but not a finish.  Please continue to push for a complete ban on assault rifles.  Civilians should not have these war weapons.
1627 2018-02-20 22:05:25 If semi-automatic rifles and large capacity magazines are outlawed, I don't think there will be a use for bump-stocks. 
1628 2018-02-20 22:05:25 Trump moves to ban 'bump stocks' 4 months after Las Vegas shooting  No many as  my finger in my hand give a damn sh... about shooting. I do. But. Destroy a building constructed  with taxpayers money is another crime.
1629 2018-02-20 22:05:25 President Trump calls for a ban to bump stocks. Do you agree?
1630 2018-02-20 22:05:24 Bump stocks are a waste of ammunition.
1631 2018-02-20 22:05:19 @SDT_Holdings $WUHN 5 mil float. 28% gain on 166K volume.

1632 2018-02-20 22:05:13 I wonder how much of a spike bump stocks sales are seeing since the Las Vegas massacre?  I’m guessing sales are back to normal, now that all the hard cores have bought them up!...so it’s ok to ban them now.
1633 2018-02-20 22:05:12 @realDonaldTrump 
And also since I was 5 I was shooting my pawpaws FULL auto .22!
I've never pointed a gun at anyone and for this to be stripped from us is a FAIL for #MAGA.
And a sad sad day for America.
Don't take our bump stocks and modifiers. Please
1634 2018-02-20 22:05:05 He's asked the justice department, to ban bump stocks, which allow semi automatic weapons to mimic automatic fire arms.
1635 2018-02-20 22:05:05 Empty memo suggesting explore/discuss/study/consider/look into/think about/sleep on it/float/ponder/ride out public fury.
NRA has, since Vegas massacre, taken position against bump stocks.
trump appeasing, faking shilling as usual.
Nothing new, nothing commendable.
#TrumpResign
1636 2018-02-20 22:05:03 Memo: Bump stocks were approved during the Obama Presidency. Now the democrats want to complain about gun control. The democrats did nothing when they had control of the House, Senate & Presidency.
1637 2018-02-20 22:05:00 NRA just compromises. “We’ll give you bump-stocks if you leave AR alone!” Hoping it’ll placate the masses. Next they’ll ask Trump to throw loaves of bread into the mob.
1638 2018-02-20 22:04:58 "Bump Stocks"  Not good enough Trump the NRA shill-in-chief . Bump stocks were supposed to be banned after Las Vegas Massacre..........Now Assault Rifles NEED to be banned.
1639 2018-02-20 22:04:58 Banning bump stocks will only create a black market geez people. People kill people not guns. Banning anything only creates a black market not that hard to figure out.
1640 2018-02-20 22:04:51 Do you agree with President's Trumps move to ban Bump Stocks?
#bumpstocks #guncontrol #GunControlNow #GunReformNow
1641 2018-02-20 22:04:50 Apparently that was enough for your NRA and Trump to sell us out over bump stocks. You have no credibility while you’re on their payroll.
1642 2018-02-20 22:04:48 Did the poll also ask how many Americans want concealed carry across state lines? That’s where the gun lobby is headed. Bump stocks is an easy painless gesture. Is there a poll on banning assault rifles? Would love to see that
1643 2018-02-20 22:04:46 US Military to remove all rifle Stocks? @realDonaldTrump
1644 2018-02-20 22:04:42 Executive Orders don't work like that. An EO just tells some part (or all) of the Executive Branch to do (or not do) something. Bump stocks are manufactured and sold by non-government employees. The civilian population doesn't have to obey the President.
1645 2018-02-20 22:04:42 @realDonaldTrump  What are you doing? With the at most respect for my president. I cannot condone to the agreement of banning bump stocks as an accessory?!  Clearly you need to take this into consideration. It's not a gun problem it's a people problem man how can you not see that
1646 2018-02-20 22:04:37 Not to mention soon we will have 3d printed bump stocks. Even guns and bullets.
1647 2018-02-20 22:04:32 @realDonaldTrump banning bump stocks are meaningless if you don't ban the gun. the shooter did not use a bump stock. stop playing politics.
1648 2018-02-20 22:04:31 Shame on you Florida House Shame on you. We need to ban AR-15 automatic assault weapons not bump stocks like trump is asking for. Media needs to be very careful how they report this latest BS by trump. Kill the NRA as a organization. #PressBriefing @cnn @msnbc @funder @nytimes
1649 2018-02-20 22:04:29 Assault rifle are not going to be banned. That's why trump only said for bumpfire stocks to be banned. We need ALL Assault rifles to be banned also.
1650 2018-02-20 22:04:29 Netflix, Inc (NFLX) price at close, 2018-02-20, is 278.16.
1651 2018-02-20 22:04:27 He is betting that he'll sooth pearl clutching independents and soccer moms with this compromise and gambling that 99.9% of gun owners aren't going to care about Bump stocks. The same way a lot of NRA members just care about their hunting rifles and not if they ban AR-15s
1652 2018-02-20 22:04:27 It's not even relevant technology to this case. He's deferring back to bump stocks to avoid the true problem of the power of the rifle.
1653 2018-02-20 22:04:25 So, @realDonaldTrump finally responds to the Vegas shooting (super late) by banning bump stocks. Baby steps? When do AR's finally get banned for Parkland? Or, do we all just not know yet that we are going to need them soon when Red Dawn commences? #TrumpColluded

1655 2018-02-20 22:04:22 Sacrificing bump-stocks, to avoid tighter background checks or lose access to military assault weapons. I've got a 7 year old in school. I want more.
1656 2018-02-20 22:04:15 Trump telling Sessions to ban bump stocks, etc....

While I think this is a good thing, I think this is just something calculated to shift our focus off of all the Troubles with Mueller.

One good action is all his supporters need to be more rabid.
1657 2018-02-20 22:04:11 @realDonaldTrump Thank you for recommending a ban on bump stocks!
1658 2018-02-20 22:04:09   #fdlx #Trump pushes for ban on gun 'bump stocks' #News
1659 2018-02-20 22:04:09 @realDonaldTrump  WHAT? WAIT, Bump stocks should have been banned right AFTER LV, and the FL shooter used AK-15? Why didn't he ban all  assault weapons??? That announcement was cover & bogus. A "memo," to Sessions to ban? Well, we all know where that memo's going..FILE 13.
1660 2018-02-20 22:04:03 Henry, Obama’s ATF approved bump stocks. The Las Vegas shooter had 12 weapons with bump stocks. Obama accomplished 0 on gun control in 8 years. He was unable to broker just about anything with congress other than Obamacare. Otherwise he gets another big fat 0 for leadership.
1661 2018-02-20 22:04:00 To those liberals that are going to come out and say banning bump stocks is useless and not good enough, please just admit it's because it's a Trump initiative. Obama did nothing to try to eliminate them, yet that was ok.  If this was an Obama plan, you'd be elated. #guncontrol
1662 2018-02-20 22:04:00 Yep. Good news. 

1. If ban actually happens
 - @realDonaldTrump has history of promising popular things he doesn't deliver (e.g., donations to charity)

2. Odd that he was against this after Vegas shooting, but is in favor now
 - We had many more shootings, but not w/bump stocks
1663 2018-02-20 22:03:59 AP: US President Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks used in Las Vegas massacre
1664 2018-02-20 22:03:55 If Congress and States take the right actions to ban assault weapons and ammunition,bump stocks,tighten gun permit and purchase regs,I would take a bullet now to safeguard my grandkids and friends and allow them to enjoy school

1665 2018-02-20 22:03:54 @wolfblitzer I try to watch CNN u say something stupid Dems all wanted bump stocks banned now that Trump agreed wolf says won't do anything
1666 2018-02-20 22:03:47 Just banning bump stocks is not enough.
1667 2018-02-20 22:03:44 You are referencing 26 USC 5845(b) definition of “machinegun.” I agree. Bump stocks are legal under the National Firearms Act.
1668 2018-02-20 22:03:44 If your only argument against bump stocks is that they, "make a gun full auto," not only are you ignorant, but you also lack the basic knowledge to contribute to a conversation on guns and gun policy.
1669 2018-02-20 22:03:40 @realDonaldTrump "We must move past clichés and tired debates and focus on evidence based solutions and security measures that actually work”. Mind telling us what “evidence” you have that banning bump stocks will reduce gun violence? #2A #SecondAmendment
1670 2018-02-20 22:03:39 Which is why the whole conversation about bump stocks is stupid. Bump stocks don’t turn a semi auto into a full  auto. 

My beef is when people want to use “fully automatic” and “machine gun” interchangeably.
1671 2018-02-20 22:03:36 Bump stocks are a red herring meant to placate the people calling for meaningful gun control. The killing of innocent people, esp children, must stop now. Ban military-style weapons NOW. #GunControlNow #WeCallBS
1672 2018-02-20 22:03:34 @realDonaldTrump announces a move to ban bump stocks for semi-automatic guns. I see Twitter is also quite tonight from all these “celebrities” quick to jump at any single thing he does...
1673 2018-02-20 22:03:33 So I think bump stocks just got banned. What's next? Triggers or sights?
1674 2018-02-20 22:03:31 #Trump may be appearing to put a sort of ban on bump stocks, but he is still trying to make it easier to get silencers for guns! @realDonaldTrump #bumpstocks
1675 2018-02-20 22:03:28 Liar, liar, pantson fire! 
No way @realDonaldTrump asked Sessions about “ bump stocks” in November and just got an answer now! 
NEVER in a million years!
1676 2018-02-20 22:03:25 And yet he was silent after Vegas when bump stocks actually were an issue.
1677 2018-02-20 22:03:21 I thought the Vegas shooter was using bump stocks?

1680 2018-02-20 22:03:08 He's called for a ban on bump stocks and talked about the need for better mental health care. Those are IDEAS.
1681 2018-02-20 22:02:57 Yea but this is only because of the NRA’s position on bump stocks.
1682 2018-02-20 22:02:55 Democrats had control of the House, Senate & Presidency. Bump stocks were approved during the Obama Presidency. Thy did nothing. Democrats also did nothing about illegal immigration during their control.
1683 2018-02-20 22:02:49 We don’t need a ban on bump stocks. We need a ban on mentally ill people being able to buy guns. And we need the age limit increased. If you can’t buy a beer you shouldn’t be able to buy a gun.
1684 2018-02-20 22:02:47 My prediction: now that bump stocks are banned, some dumbass will make a bump brace and then the ATF won't less us have those either.

1686 2018-02-20 22:02:42 President Trump just sent @jeffsession executive memo to outlaw 'Bump Stocks' making semi autos into full autos. 
I dont have a problem with that, EXCEPT Pres Trump should outlaw law enforcement having them as well (or any full auto). 2nd Amed was to fight tyranny from Gubamint
1687 2018-02-20 22:02:41 TRUMP. Too little and too late on changing the law on bump stocks. This is a minor appeasement. Too minor. The majority of Americans are calling for far more but you have  to consider the NRA and the money you received. SOME DOLLARS FOR A KIDS LIFE. I just want to vomit.
1688 2018-02-20 22:02:40 And what about assault weapons???? They need to be included, bump stocks are a small financial dent for NRA protected gun manufacturers. You are letting their profit dictate the safety of children’s lives. Your flimsy concessions are Not Acceptable!
1689 2018-02-20 22:02:40 If gun control "doesn't work" like you say Mr. President, then why are you moving to ban bump stocks?
1690 2018-02-20 22:02:36 Big wow on the bump stocks. Like a mere crumb from Trump to the "libtards".

1695 2018-02-20 22:02:22 I'll compromise, ban bump stocks in exchange for reclassifying SBR's as non NFA weapons.
1696 2018-02-20 22:02:18 Is anybody really surprised?! Come on! WAKE UP! You had to know he would do something to appease this media drama scene taking place.

What?
1716 2018-02-20 22:01:47 I give credit where it's due and I give credit to Trump to ordering the DOJ today to pass regulations to ban all firearm items like bump stocks. Finally someone is doing something. Long overdue! Hopefully there is no opposition to this common sense regulation.

1718 2018-02-20 22:01:42 bump stocks are not protected. You can create something to affix to a gun that does make it more unreliable and dangerous. Letting them ban this "toy" with no purpose is no threat to gun ownership.
1719 2018-02-20 22:01:41 Can ICE be retasked to round up bump stocks?
1720 2018-02-20 22:01:41 If you go back and loon you will see the NRA was and is in favor of banning bump stocks
1721 2018-02-20 22:01:38 Machine guns have a definition in statute. The president does not have the authority to ban stuff except in accordance with laws passed by Congress. Bump stocks do not meet the definition of a machine gun.
1722 2018-02-20 22:01:35 Trump just offered up the most expedient, least politically damaging crumbs with banning bump stocks. No doubt this qualifies, for him and the GOP, as “doing something “.  Nice try. Now how about the hard work it will take to make it hard for those with mental health issues?
1723 2018-02-20 22:01:28 From White House press pool: @POTUS has directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to craft federal regulations banning “bump stocks” and other devices that turn semi-automatic firearms into automatic weapons. #MApoli
1724 2018-02-20 22:01:26 Bump stocks make you less accurate this does not affect me or many gun owners in any way.
1725 2018-02-20 22:01:18 mass shooting are actually an outlier. If you address violent crime and mental health then mass shootings tend not to occur.  However if you just focus on mass shootings then all the other crime still happens. banning bump stocks will not reduce violent crime.
1726 2018-02-20 22:01:12 There will be no auto, semiauto weapon or ^6 round clips ban due to NRA owning GOP. BUT...Price of ammunition, gun powder, reload supplies and after market clips, bump stocks needs to skyrocket. Charge  $1000.00 + a box for ammunition for AR, AK, M rifles.
1727 2018-02-20 22:01:12 Would that be the Bump Stocksthe process started after Las Vegas At least it’s a start
1728 2018-02-20 22:01:09 You just don't understand trump-speak.  He's banning bump stock accessories, not bump stocks themselves.  This simply means you will no longer be able to buy accessories for them; things like stickers and bracelets and whatnot.
1729 2018-02-20 22:01:05 .@SymsForAZ, how can you not even allow a debate on banning bump stocks. As one of your constituents and a volunteer with @MomsDemand, I am deeply disappointed. All we want is some #GunSense #AZLeg
1730 2018-02-20 22:01:03 So Trump now wants to ban bump stocks, which is from like 2-3 mass shootings ago.
1731 2018-02-20 22:01:00 Did you know about bump stocks before the Vegas massacre?  Most didn’t either. So simmer your sanctimony.
1732 2018-02-20 22:00:58 It must be a cold day in hell. For the first time in 13 months, I actually agree with Trump. Banning Bump Stocks is the best thing he’s done since becoming President. It’s a very small step, more needs to be done.
1733 2018-02-20 22:00:58 Matt re listen to Trumps talk... Bump stocks do not change the definition of a semi auto. I think its a chess game to shut up some of the left... JMO
1734 2018-02-20 22:00:52 DO YOU SUPPORT THISThen renew 1994 Ban on Assault Weapons WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has directed his attorney general to propose regulations that would ban bump stocks and similar devices "that turn legal weapons into machine guns," the president announced Tuesday.
1735 2018-02-20 22:00:49 "No rational reason" is an opinion shared among Dems and loathed by GOP  

If congress acted by first fixing the communication SNAFU with what happened in Parkland and also banned bump stocks used in Vegas, those are valid starting points. 

Banning guns is a slippery slope.

Please don't take our rifle modifiers and bump stocks away. I'm 32 and since I was 5 I have been using them for shoot days with my family.
I have grown up with them and been around the stuff all my life please don't let the blue team take this away from the USA!
1742 2018-02-20 22:00:38 Yeah he's such a winner...banning bump stocks (not slide/ASSAULT weapons) standing on the graves on the same KIDS he threw under the bus Saturday.
1743 2018-02-20 22:00:33 I'm sure the NRA will oppose any effort to ban "laughing stocks" too.

But for the record, no, this is the first time we've examined this since 2013.  And it is up to the readers what they do with this information. We report.
1744 2018-02-20 22:00:33 The problem isnt the bump stocks...the AR15 that can be converted to an automatic riffle very easily.   
99.9999% of massacres w/ assault weapons didnt use bump stocks
1745 2018-02-20 22:00:25 I doubt there are many serious gun owners who give a shit about bump stocks.

1747 2018-02-20 22:00:21 It's time to BOTH...defend schools with TRAINED ARMED officials...and get rid of few 'VERY-easy-to-get' UNNECESSARY, potentially lethal items: ie bump stocks, 30 OR 20 round mags. No more 'taking only Left...or only Right side'. Let's take side that lowers  odds of children dying
1748 2018-02-20 22:00:19 I can see it now. Unhinged liberals were demanding that Trump ban Bump Stocks. Now that he has, unhinged Liberals will be screaming that Trump is a dictator and taking away the civil liberties of rightful gun owners.
1749 2018-02-20 22:00:19 @POTUS Thanks for buckling on bump stocks. What else are you going to cave on? .. I will NOT surrender my bump stock. Take that too the bank...
1750 2018-02-20 22:00:17 Ban the sale of bump stocks or ban their use altogether?
1751 2018-02-20 22:00:16 But the wheels are turning now as @potus has just signed a MEMORANDUM to produce a PROPOSAL related to bump stocks! This should resolve the Las Vegas shooting last October! @PressSec should tell us about the new law any time now! Special thanks to @SpeakerRyan & @SenateMajLdr !
1752 2018-02-20 22:00:16 Let's keep the bump stocks and ban the guns, how many kids would be killed getting hit with a bump stock and how many bump stocks can a person throw in a minute!
1753 2018-02-20 22:00:15 Mr President if you enact any type of gun control (including bump stocks) you will lose the support of your base, you will put 2020 completely out of reach.
1754 2018-02-20 22:00:13 @realDonaldTrump EXCELLENT start on the gun problem -Ban Bump Stocks
KEEP it UP !!
1755 2018-02-20 22:00:09 Ovamitt is the one whom signed off on the bump stocks.
1756 2018-02-20 22:00:00 its nice that @realDonaldTrump wants to try and save face by prepping some "memo" to have someone else deal with bump stocks, but if I am not mistaken the #ParklandSchoolShooting student did NOT use a bump stock, so please keep going don't stop with just bump stocks.
1757 2018-02-20 21:59:58 45 wants bump stocks banned? Oh good, now LESS people will die before the police can get there!
1758 2018-02-20 21:59:58 NRA life. Bump stocks are stupid. Regulate as a fully automatic weapon with the transfer fee.
1759 2018-02-20 21:59:49 Its a start. Bump stocks should never have been a thing to begin with. Getting rid of them is good. But this is not enough. Background checks at gun shows have to happen.
1760 2018-02-20 21:59:48 And if a future shooting happens with a bump stock attachment you’ll say why didn’t you ban bump stocks?!
1761 2018-02-20 21:59:44 Stocks have gone up big since 2009 as rates were going down. Stocks crashed as Greenspan raises rates to crush the .com bubble.
1762 2018-02-20 21:59:42 The same thing the NRA did saying "Hey ATF, maybe you should look at regulating bump stocks, we think they should be"?
1763 2018-02-20 21:59:40 Where do you see $BYOC in 6 months from now!
1764 2018-02-20 21:59:27 Its still not clear whether just banning bump stocks will be an effective enough distraction.
1765 2018-02-20 21:59:22 Foolishness to think bump stocks can be banned. Something people can make in their garage! Nonsense to hope in banning such things. Those who have a mind to harm others will always find a way. Evil people do evil things and decent people do decent things. Legislation is hopeless!
1766 2018-02-20 21:59:10 Bump stocks should be banned but at the end of the day, how many more people died in Vegas because of the bump stock? I'd guess the number would be low.

The bump stock made an already efficient killing machine, even more efficient but banning them hardly solves anything.
1767 2018-02-20 21:59:10 In the US the DOJ has 0 authority to ban bump stocks.  Even 45's inept WH team knows that. Congress has to do it.  They won't. Congress previously punted issue to ATF to study, delaying action for 1-2 years minimum. 45's memo is window dressing, changes nothing.
1768 2018-02-20 21:59:10 Eight years of right-wing caterwauling about ‘Obama the gun-grabber’ and it’s actually Trump who calls for a crackdown on 2nd Amendment rights today by calling for a ban on bump stocks. What do you say about your man now, @NRA ?
1769 2018-02-20 21:59:09 Banning the sale of bump stocks will not stop another mass slaughter of our children.  Banning the sale of military assault weapons could.  Donald Trump is proposing the former so as to avoid having to confront the NRA and see GOP campaign donations dry up. #GunReformNow
1770 2018-02-20 21:59:01 I would hardly say Dems are getting blamed. I mean, Obummer blamed 43 for shit well into his 2nd term. Request for justice dept to ban bump stocks is a great start.
1771 2018-02-20 21:58:52 TRUMP IS BANNING BUMP STOCKS!!! fuck yeah
1772 2018-02-20 21:58:48 Ban everything but muzzle loading, pump action, break action/breach loading, lever action, revolving cylinder and bolt action. No magazines over 6 rounds. No more than 2 firing chambers w/exception on guns shorter than 6in(revolvers). No suppressors. No bump stocks.
1773 2018-02-20 21:58:47 Don't kid yourself for a minute. The NRA doesn't want bump stocks banned. Keep your eye on the ball. An assault style weapons ban.
1774 2018-02-20 21:58:44 #CommonSenseGunLaws need to be instituted. Trump banning bump stocks is like giving a 200lb man a grain of rice and saying, see... I fed him. Prouder of all of you #ParklandStudents than our own leaders. We live in sad times. Change it.
#GunControlNow
#TrumpColluded
1775 2018-02-20 21:58:43 @realDonaldTrump it’s not what’s in your hand but what’s in your heart. Banning bump stocks will NOT change anything!!!!
1776 2018-02-20 21:58:42 Trump just lost some, or a lot, of his base by outlawing bump stocks.
1777 2018-02-20 21:58:40 Take your bump stocks, but do not revive the anemic 94 gun ban. Contrary to popular belief, a gun ban does not make it illegal to purchase the weapon. It only makes it illegal to purchase one manufactured after the ban date.
1778 2018-02-20 21:58:36 Well this is a startDo YOU support it WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has directed his attorney general to propose regulations that would ban bump stocks and similar devices "that turn legal weapons into machine guns," the president announced Tuesday.
1779 2018-02-20 21:58:33 Banning bump stocks is absolutely pointless. It won't prevent a single shooting, and it won't score Trump any political points from the left, and in fact he might even lose some support among Conservatives and Libertarians. #trump
1780 2018-02-20 21:58:32 3 Mass Shooting in 4 months. Bump Stocks not going to do much. No civilian needs #WeaponsOfWar
1781 2018-02-20 21:58:30 bump stocks?
1782 2018-02-20 21:58:30 A great way to teach them about gun safety would be to ban AR-15's and bump stocks.
1783 2018-02-20 21:58:25 Bump stocks is not da problem dumb ass!!!SMFH
1784 2018-02-20 21:58:17 Did you see the latest news Trump moves to ban bump stocks for our guns. He started the same crap all the other presidents have done what’s next
1785 2018-02-20 21:58:12 @realDonaldTrump #DonaldTrump If it's true, your banning bump stocks on guns is the smartest thing you've done in over a year. Why haven't you tweeted this? Afraid of alienating your base?
1786 2018-02-20 21:58:11 Wouldn't you be if you worked for @realDonaldTrump?He won't even do a simple presser in front of the"fake news" people because he seems scared of real investigative journalists.I 'm proud he has ordered the ban of "bump stocks" about time. IMHO
1787 2018-02-20 21:58:11 Haha. Only because he thought they said burp stocks. He'll change his mind before his wingnut coachella speech on Friday.
1788 2018-02-20 21:58:08 @realDonaldTrump - Not one more piece of gun “legislation” is needed. (i.e.: bump stocks) Common sense and enforcement of laws on the books.
1789 2018-02-20 21:58:08 #TuesdayThoughts Let Trump take some credit for banning bump stocks. I mean, how many are there? Who gives a shit. It's not giving in to the hysteria and it is out-maneuvering the "do something crowd". And I trust him not to go down a slippery slope. Good job(again) POTUS!

1791 2018-02-20 21:57:58 Don't need bump stocks 4 protection & I am a 2A advocate.
1792 2018-02-20 21:57:53 didn't Trump just put in the executive order to order the DOJ to ban bump stocks today? this reads like it was already done.
1793 2018-02-20 21:57:51 You realize that bump stocks don't chance a semi auto weapon into a full auto, right?
1794 2018-02-20 21:57:46 he's not even proposing to ban bump stocks. he's asking sessions to "look into it" - he's dedicated to doing nothing

he'll do nothing if that's the last thing he ever does.
1795 2018-02-20 21:57:46 Trump tells DoJ to start work on banning bump stocks. Why wasn't this done 4 months ago after the Vegas shooting?
1796 2018-02-20 21:57:46 You should ask the ATF why Bump Stocks were approved.  As well as other things like Auto triggers
1797 2018-02-20 21:57:45 Stock market doing well and Obama somehow gets credit.. Stock market dips and it's all Trump's fault. Good to see now that stocks are going up again it's because of Obama. The Left aren't hypocrites at all, are they?
1798 2018-02-20 21:57:41 Bump stocks?  You gotta do better than that.
1799 2018-02-20 21:57:41 .@realDonaldTrump  the ban on bump stocks is the least minimum you can do bro.  It's like fingering a girl for 5 seconds before sex.
1800 2018-02-20 21:57:39 Cliff's Note's: The President caved on bump stocks, and who knows what he'll do to background checks.
1801 2018-02-20 21:57:36 They'll need to go back and rewrite the underlying law, then. Bump stocks can't be outlawed by the President. They need to hash this out on the legislative side.
1802 2018-02-20 21:57:35 Should we ban bump stocks?
1803 2018-02-20 21:57:32 Liberals think America will be much safer when only the following people have guns:

1. Law Enforcement 
2. Celebrity Bodyguards 
3. Criminals

Bump Stocks
1804 2018-02-20 21:57:28 When did the president order regulations to ban bump stocks?  After Parkland?  Vegas happened some time ago.
1805 2018-02-20 21:57:27 Let's trade Bump Stocks for no abortions after 20 weeks. See how serious the Dem's really are.
1806 2018-02-20 21:57:16 Based on what I know, as a non-gun owner, it seems that bump stocks only reduce accuracy, so anyone who WOULD buy them is fairly stupid, so there's no NEED to ban them.  They'll stop being sold once the idiots wake up and see there's no real benefit to have one. #MarketForces
1807 2018-02-20 21:57:14 "Trump directs attorney general to create regulations to ban ‘bump stocks’"

Smoke and Mirrors - Hoping we will think this solves Florida?  No chance buddy
1808 2018-02-20 21:57:14 BREAKING NEWS: Sen. Marco Rubio has called for a “task force of experts” to examine mass shootings. He is considering removing weapons from those accused of domestic violence, banning bump stocks, and improving violence-prevention programs to detect signs of trouble ahead of time
1809 2018-02-20 21:57:12 Obama had 8 years to tackle gun control. He accomplished a big fat 0. And, if I’m not mistaken bump stocks, once banned, were re- approved under his administration.
1810 2018-02-20 21:57:11 Folks @realDonaldTrump ordering justice dept to "draft" a ban on bump stocks....oooh, that would make a difference...NOT! It's the gun that the bump stock attaches to #moroninchief that KILLS INNOCENT LIVES...AMERICANS!
1811 2018-02-20 21:57:10 Amazing that they can ram tax kickbacks in a week or two and it takes +5 months to study bump stocks and still no resolution?
1812 2018-02-20 21:57:05 Your use of the subjunctive mood ("... would be ... ") is telling.  Let's hold our applause until the rule is in place.  And will it involve collecting those bump stocks already out there?
1813 2018-02-20 21:56:59 @realDonaldTrump is now pushing for the ban of bump stocks and other gun accessories
1814 2018-02-20 21:56:51 Banning bump stocks is a diversion. You can do the exact same thing with a rubberband and some practice.

#NotEnough #NotNearlyEnough
1815 2018-02-20 21:56:47 Commissioner Rob Manfred just said that, in a effort to speed the pace of play, he has directed Joe Torre to explore banning bump stocks.
1816 2018-02-20 21:56:47 Ban bump stocks, assault rifles and increase care & transparency for mentally challenged. Need more information available for those who sell guns.
1817 2018-02-20 21:56:47 @realDonaldTrump Arent you proud?  You get to ban Bump Stocks (omitting Slide stocks) and get your rating up!  Of course you get to do this standing on the graves of the 15 kids you slung under the buss the other day...

#TheResistance #ImpeachTrump #MAGA #BlueWave2018
1818 2018-02-20 21:56:47 Well mr. President you probably just lost my vote. By directing the Attorney General to ban bump stocks, you open the door for any other modification even adding a sling to be eliminated.@realDonaldTrump
1819 2018-02-20 21:56:46 I can give him some, ban bump stocks, ban AR 15's, close gun show loophole.
1820 2018-02-20 21:56:46 The hypocrisy you spew is amazing. 6 months ago you were demanding bump stocks be banned and Trump was evil for not doing it. Now you say it's just a distraction?  Really?  This kinda shit is why #PresidentTrump will be re-elected in 2020.
1821 2018-02-20 21:56:45 $USFD is one of heavily accumulated value stocks by a few notable multi-billion hedge funds including Ricky Sandler's Eminence Capital, James Dinan's York Capital in 17Q4. Ricky Sandler purchased additional 1.18M shs at avg $31.96/sh since Q4, raised stake to 5.4% 11.66M shs.
1822 2018-02-20 21:56:45 He should have. I do believe if Obama had banned 'bump stocks' during his presidency, Trump would have overturned that order by now. He's a petty, small man who can't stand Obama. Trump would have reversed anything Obama passed with regard to guns.
1823 2018-02-20 21:56:44 GOP moved fast to pass Trump's tax bill gift to rich ppl; let's see how fast they move to protect lives of our children by banning assault weapons. Trump directed Sessions to ban bump stocks; does he think we'll be satisfied with that while assault weapons stay on street?
1824 2018-02-20 21:56:42 Banning bump stocks should be an easy no-brainer for Congress, but obviously based on past performance has not been. Also, reinstituting the ban on assault weapons & strengthening the vetting process, i.e. Mental Health Issues should be part of this if it is to be done right.
1825 2018-02-20 21:56:39 Ban everything but muzzle loading, pump action, break action/breach loading, lever action, revolving cylinder and bolt action. No magazines over 6 rounds. No more than 2 firing chambers w/exception on guns shorter than 6in(revolvers). No suppressors. No bump stocks.
1826 2018-02-20 21:56:38 @realDonaldTrump so you are banning bump stocks?  Too little too late Donny. You are responsible for allowing mentally disturbed people to buy weapons in the first place. You partied while 40 miles away children were being buried because of your actions
1827 2018-02-20 21:56:36 The paperwork and background checks to get a federal firearms stamp for an automatic rifle take up to a year. Bump stocks skirt that process.
1828 2018-02-20 21:56:36 The @NRA agreed there should be restrictions on bump stocks months ago...
1829 2018-02-20 21:56:36 Well, this is a start WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has directed his attorney general to propose regulations that would ban bump stocks and similar devices "that turn legal weapons into machine guns," the president announced Tuesday.
1830 2018-02-20 21:56:36 Bump stocks are the equivalent of installing a Cherry Bomb Glasspack on a rice burner.
1831 2018-02-20 21:56:34 Give the kid a break. He’s a high school journalist and dealing with a sick tragedy that occurred in his school. And he’s totally right - this needs to stop. I’m glad @potus wants to ban bump stocks but semi-automatics  should be banned from civilians too .
1832 2018-02-20 21:56:33 A cold cynical & calculated move as approved by the NRA. If he wanted to save kids it would be an immediate ban & buy back program on assault weapons like the AR-15, in addition to bump stocks & high capacity mags.
1833 2018-02-20 21:56:32 Bump stocks?
1834 2018-02-20 21:56:30 THE NRA signed off on bump stocks after VEGAS.  They will do nothing until they get the blessing of the mighty NRA.
1835 2018-02-20 21:56:26 Trump hasn't banned shit, but he did pretty much ensure that bump stocks will again be flying off the shelves.
1836 2018-02-20 21:56:22 Correct.  If they had integrity and convictions, bump stocks would have been banned shortly after Las Vegas mass shooting.  They hoped we were distracted and had forgotten.
1837 2018-02-20 21:56:19 Trump moving to ban bump stocks may be the only productive thing he gets done in office, if he actually gets it done and doesn't backpedal.
1838 2018-02-20 21:56:18 As a gun owner here’s the issue, it’s full of loopholes that will allow the investigation by the ATF to conclude that bump stocks do not turn semi-automatic rifles into machine guns. It’s also written by someone who knows nothing about guns.
1839 2018-02-20 21:56:08 I promise you thats something you wouldnt have to worry about. I trade stocks for a living so i am normally always home lol
1840 2018-02-20 21:56:07 @WashingtonPost and @CNN are hinting that Trump is signing a ban of bump stocks and other legislation. We will see it to believe it.
1841 2018-02-20 21:56:07 Trump vil forby såkalte «bump stocks»...
1842 2018-02-20 21:56:07 Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications, ie. such as bump stocks used in Vegas. Ok. A reasonable action.

And cue the “it’s not enough” tweets in 3,2,1...
1843 2018-02-20 21:56:07 bump stocks are a gimmick something you unlock on call of duty, I respect the 2nd amendment but Bump stocks are retarded
1844 2018-02-20 21:56:03 Screw bump stocks why does anyone need a semi or automatic assault rifle
1845 2018-02-20 21:56:03 Am I missing something, or is Trump's "banning all devices that turn legal weapons into machineguns" actually not applicable to bump stocks?  They result in a higher rate of fire than a semiauto rifle, but they don't actually change the internal firing action to fully automatic.
1846 2018-02-20 21:56:01 Did...did Trump just do something logical? Only took 4.5 months since Vegas to find we don't need bump stocks. I'll believe it if it passes.
1847 2018-02-20 21:55:58 Wow Trump just really banned bump stocks
1848 2018-02-20 21:55:53 65% Republican-controlled Florida House state legislators just voted down discussion abt banning bump stocks, military-grade rifles. FL House legislators refuse to see #DouglasStrong students, now on route to Tallahassee.
1849 2018-02-20 21:55:53 Banning bump stocks is a token measure: the only major shooting in which a bump stock was implicated was Las Vegas last year. So wooh, the next AR-15 school shooter won’t have a high rate of fire.
1850 2018-02-20 21:55:51 banning bump stocks ... ya the NRA suggested that
in October
last year
so not his idea ... shame
1851 2018-02-20 21:55:51 Congrats you just made those idiotic bump stocks cool.
1852 2018-02-20 21:55:50 People worry about bump stocks?!! Guns?! Why don't people worry about what actually kills people on a daily basis like heroin, abortions, alcoholism, suicide. Even trips, slips and falls.
1853 2018-02-20 21:55:48 That’s all fine and dandy but people can make bump stocks out of wood or simply use their finger.
1854 2018-02-20 21:55:43 Scalise will be to blame when the stocks tank
1855 2018-02-20 21:55:41 Bump stocks aren't the problem. It still goes back to the point that people kill people!
1856 2018-02-20 21:55:36 It’s been proven Bump Stocks are pretty much useless anyways so he’s basically just virtue signaling!
1857 2018-02-20 21:55:36 Presumably the ATF would have to change either its factual understanding of how bump stocks work or its legal understanding of what is a "machinegun" for purposes of federal law.
1858 2018-02-20 21:55:35 Hey, @realDonaldTrump if you ban bump stocks, and endanger our second amendment rights. Don’t expect to get re-elected!! #DefendTheSecond
1859 2018-02-20 21:55:34 I wonder what Trump had to give the NRA for permission to ban bump-stocks.
1860 2018-02-20 21:55:33 At least here in Massachusetts we banned bump stocks months ago, and our gov is a Republican! TY Governor Charlie Baker @MassGovernor we don't need to wait for AG Sessions to consider a memorandum to talk about doing it.
1861 2018-02-20 21:55:32 @realDonaldTrump I don’t think banning bump stocks or anything else will keep a criminal from getting whatever they want Just sayin I do understand that you’re trying to appease those brainless people that are screaming but we all know it won’t do any good
1862 2018-02-20 21:55:32 Ammunition is expensive. Bump stocks waste ammo!
1863 2018-02-20 21:55:31 Trump: "hey jeff, propose some ideas to regulate 'bump stocks'"
Sessions: "mr. president, would you please pass me the metamucil"
1864 2018-02-20 21:55:30 NRA supports banning bump stocks.
1865 2018-02-20 21:55:29 Trump just signed a memorandum to ban bum stocks.. how do you feel about that?
1866 2018-02-20 21:55:29 @marcorubio, you said if someone decided they're going to commit a crime they'll find a way to get the gun and do it. Wouldn't the same be true of bump stocks? If so, why ban those and not assault rifles? @GOP logic on this makes no sense.
1867 2018-02-20 21:55:29 I've already seen Leftists claiming that "just banning bump stocks is not enough" or "too late".
1868 2018-02-20 21:55:23 Well, that one is kind of low-hanging fruit and I’m a bit surprised bump stocks weren’t banned the day after Las Vegas. 

Essentially turns a gun into an automatic and helped kill 50+ people. Not needed for hunting, self-defense, or sport. 

Seems like an obvious one.
1869 2018-02-20 21:55:22 Yep! Being told what I can have and not have gets expensive, I'll have a couple of bump stocks by Friday...incredible waste of ammo I think but hey! They're going to outlawed? 
1870 2018-02-20 21:55:20 Daily MACD of indexes are crossing up today, bullish for mid-term.  Tech stocks reach resistance and fall less, may fall more to catch up downward move of the market.
1871 2018-02-20 21:55:18 I thought maybe once Trump was going to do something without alternative motive, doing it because it’s the right thing. But no, it’s just another shot at President O’bama.I’m sure other administrations were unaware of bump stocks, too.I was and grew up in a law enforcement family
1872 2018-02-20 21:55:15 Why don't more traders use stop losses? 

#traders #daytrading #stocks #forex #futures #stoploss
1873 2018-02-20 21:55:15 Not enough. Bump stocks should have been done the last time murders happened. Assault  Weapons Ban !!!!
1874 2018-02-20 21:55:11 What do you make of this new Trump memorandum on bump stocks? Effective ?
1875 2018-02-20 21:55:09 trump going for the easy win...only using bump stocks ban as a solution is like putting one sand bag in the way of a raging flood
1876 2018-02-20 21:55:08 Florida State House votes DOWN the MOTION to ban AR-15s...absurd. #MussORANGElini gonna ban bump-stocks...literally the very-very LEAST he could do, and over due from Vegas. These kids have a near-impossible fight ahead and will need to get into office ASAP. #NeverAgainMSD
1877 2018-02-20 21:55:07 @realDonaldTrump 
Regarding the 2nd and "Bump Stocks".
"Shall not be infringed upon".
1878 2018-02-20 21:55:02 President Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks used in Las Vegas massacre WHAT ABOUT LETTING A MENTALLY ILL 19 YR OLD TO BUY AN AR-15?  YOUR DESPICABLE LITTLE DONNIE,  AND HATEFUL SATAN
1879 2018-02-20 21:55:02 Stop reporting that a Trump memo to propose to study a thing is a push to ban bump stocks. Give me a fucking break. We're over a year in now and you've learned nothing.
1880 2018-02-20 21:55:00 Republicans are much more happy regulating bums than they are regulating bump stocks.
1881 2018-02-20 21:54:44 .@AZHouseDems tried to force a vote on banning bump stocks today. GOP lawmakers didn’t allow it. They refuse to even hear #GunSense bills. The only solution is to #ThrowThemOut #AZLeg @MomsDemand
1882 2018-02-20 21:54:41 Apparently the NRA is aware the public is tired of the refusal to address the gun issue so has given approval to ban bump stocks which was suggested long ago. Trump is no hero folks. The NRA is behind this.
1883 2018-02-20 21:54:37 The pending possible regulations on bump stocks only happened because everyone was polite and used an appropriately respectful tone. Always know your place, citizens!
1884 2018-02-20 21:54:31 Bump stocks aren't the problem.

Guns are the problem.
1885 2018-02-20 21:54:29 AR-15 are sometimes sold as regular rifles that do not have a full or semi-automatic configuration that would classify it as an assault rifle.  Bump-stocks convert those particular rifles to fire semi or full auto.
1886 2018-02-20 21:54:29 Bump stocks gone!
TRUMP doesn't fart around 
No more bla, bla, bla.
He wins again!
1887 2018-02-20 21:54:25 Trump has apparently ordered that a regulation be issued banning "bump stocks." A really bold gun control move. That is, one that the NRA itself called for.
1888 2018-02-20 21:54:24 What happened when your boy Obama was in office for the previous EIGHT YEARS.... he could've banned bump stocks, "assault" rifles, mods, etc.

He didn't.

He completely had Congress the first 2  years in office.

He did nothing.

Now you wanna pin this on Trump?!

#ludicrous
1889 2018-02-20 21:54:24 Lawlessness (lack of having your own rules to regulate your trades) is always self-defeating. It will be difficult to self-instill a set of solid rules. Do it anyway. 
#mindset #trading #stocks #stockmarket #forex #forextrading
1890 2018-02-20 21:54:20 We wanted bump stocks banned after Vegas. They sort of agreed, then ignored it....again.now that there's a very for serious gun reform, they are throwing us a bone...bump stocks. 

Not enough! 
#neveragain
1891 2018-02-20 21:54:17 Bump stocks or guns? 
Give a little.
1892 2018-02-20 21:54:16 Alright screw it then. Bring the bump stocks back then. You'll bitch about change and when he starts to do it you complain. He can't just ban guns over night, shit takes time.
1893 2018-02-20 21:54:13 Legitimate gun owners support longer waiting periods, age limits, firearm safety training and registration, and a ban of bump stocks, automatic and semi-automatic firearms. 
You sound like you’re on the side of the “psychos”.
1894 2018-02-20 21:54:12 It sounds like @realDonaldTrump is going to update the gun background check registry and ban bump stocks/accessories that turns guns into killing machines.

If he does, I'll be impressed. That's a HUGE win for America!
#GunReformNow
1895 2018-02-20 21:54:11 @marcorubio @POTUS @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump  if you ban bump stocks the ban alachol as alcohol is responsible for more deaths than guns and accessories. Trump is selling out or are these his true colors.
1896 2018-02-20 21:54:08 The NRA doesn't give a rat's ass about bump stocks, they've already signaled that. This will be Trump's cover to say he did "something"- if he actually follows through- in truth it's a drop in the bucket.
1897 2018-02-20 21:54:06 No, it doesn't 

Includes any firearm with a buttstock and either a rifled barrel less than 16" long or An overall length under 26". The overall length is measured with any folding or collapsing stocks in the extended position.
1898 2018-02-20 21:54:03 Banning bump stocks is a great idea. But even a semi-automatic .223 or 5.56 ought to be *nowhere near* civilian populations.
1899 2018-02-20 21:54:01 I repeat, Trump is a moron for calling for this Bump Stocks regulation now. It just signals to the jackals that they can use any tragedy to get more legislation and he will comply. Trump is dumb, stop convincing yourself otherwise. #GunControl #2A #NRA
1900 2018-02-20 21:53:56 Remember when Republicans were definitely going to ban bump stocks after the last one and then didn't. Yeah.
1901 2018-02-20 21:53:55 I agree bump stocks shouldn’t be legal, it’s a memorandum to the Attorney General and Justice Department to take action so that they’re no longer legal.
1902 2018-02-20 21:53:48 @POTUS please tweet something about how you’re directing the Justice Dept to propose regulations to ban bump stocks so I can finally  something you’ve tweeted.
1903 2018-02-20 21:53:46 Banning bump stocks is literally below bare minimum
1904 2018-02-20 21:53:43 Trump still hasn't done anything to prevent another mass shooting from happening. Banning bump stocks won't stop another shooting. Banning assault weapons might. Why doesn't Trump wanna protect Americans? Or even try to? Oh, because he's a traitor. #TrumpColluded #GunReformNow
1905 2018-02-20 21:53:43 No way to know for sure, but it had to help getting it through Trump that the Obama admin had a different position on bump stocks
1906 2018-02-20 21:53:41 Credit where credits due, Trumps signed a memo asking for  bump stocks to be banned, it's a small step but it's a step non the less
1907 2018-02-20 21:53:39 The only long term solution is very strict gun laws, banning civilians from having assault rifles of any kind, banning gun stocks and large capacity clips...for starters...
1908 2018-02-20 21:53:32 You have nothing to say about  POTUS  trying to ban bump stocks?
1909 2018-02-20 21:53:22 Congrats to the student activists across this land in the wake of the Florida school shooting. Trump has directed the DOJ to write regs banning bump stocks & other means to create automatic weapons . You roared Hey Hey NRA how many kids did U kill today?  The NRA trembled.
1910 2018-02-20 21:53:19 Having already blamed the FLA students, the FBI, the community, @realDonaldTrump today blames Pres Obama for the very existence of bump stocks.
1911 2018-02-20 21:53:18 Bump stocks? HiCap mags next? But for all the trump supportersto use your vernacular, Trumps doing gun control and coming for your guns.
1912 2018-02-20 21:53:17 Not a gunsmith expert here or anything but on a semi auto gun you need to press the trigger to fire and then release it back to a certain position for it to "reset" and be ready to be pressed and fire again. Bump stocks do that for you so you do not have to reset your finger.
1913 2018-02-20 21:53:10 The only legislation I’ve seen so far regarding “Banning Bump Stocks” was so poorly written it would make adding a match grade trigger a felony. @POTUS
1914 2018-02-20 21:53:09 Ban bump stocks?  Just ban assault weapons, the sole purpose of which is to kill as many people as possible. No civilian needs these weapons for sport or protection. Nobody's 2nd Amend rights are seriously impacted. Not a slippery slope
1915 2018-02-20 21:53:07 @realDonaldTrump 
I thought you said you would protect the 2nd Amendment ???? A lack of morals is the problem !!! NOT BUMP STOCKS AND MODIFICATIONS !!!!!!!
1916 2018-02-20 21:53:07 Most people: We want a ban on assault weapons. 
WH: We will look into bump stocks. 
Nothing will change and I doubt they will even ban bump stocks.
1917 2018-02-20 21:53:05 #Dolt45’s new push to ban bump stocks let’s us know that “3 and a half months” is the answer to “when can we talk about solutions to mass shootings after a mass shooting.” Glad we got that squared away.
1918 2018-02-20 21:53:05 @DLoesch @realDonaldTrump wants age change, eed to bump stocks, give an inch take a mile, how far will they go?
1919 2018-02-20 21:53:05 Should we ban bump stocks?
1920 2018-02-20 21:53:02 Weren’t bump stocks developed to assist the handicapped ?
1921 2018-02-20 21:53:00 Questions about the ban on bump stocks:
- Will people who currently own bump stocks need to turn them in?
- If not, will gun ranges allow shooters to use bump stocks. (few have the capacity now, but still...)
- Will committing crimes with bump stocks come w/ bigger penalties?
1922 2018-02-20 21:52:58 I think we can all agree that bump stocks should be illegal
1923 2018-02-20 21:52:56 . @realDonaldTrump How many regulations will you have to eliminate in order to have one outlawing bump stocks?  Hey, that was YOUR mandate.
1924 2018-02-20 21:52:55 Hats off to Trump banning bump stocks,
Not a solution but a well needed move in the right direction to cut down this awful gun culture in the states
1925 2018-02-20 21:52:52 Especially the @wnbachicagosky game ops!!! We gets it in every game.
1926 2018-02-20 21:52:51 record setting sub and laughing stocks on a lot of lists together
1927 2018-02-20 21:52:46 Le président Trump assure avoir ordonné que soient déclarés illégaux ces gadgets ('bump stocks') qui rendent automatique une arme semi-auto.
Le dispositif avait été utilisé par le tireur de Las Vegas.
Demain, il rencontre des parents et jeunes touchés de près par fusillades.
1928 2018-02-20 21:52:45 #BREAKING: RT @AP_Politics: BREAKING: President Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks used in Las Vegas massacre.

1930 2018-02-20 21:52:40 Wise-owl believes the recent selloff in U.S. stocks was the appetiser, not the main course #stocks #asx #nasdaq #wallstreet
1931 2018-02-20 21:52:35 We need change. You do not need military style assault weapons. You do not need bump stocks. You do not need these things for hunting or keeping your home safe. Your reasons are lame and are not worth children’s lives. So fuck off with your 2nd amendment argument, it’s 2018.
1932 2018-02-20 21:52:32 I guess u don’t have stocks and I guess u dint notice the big tax cuts wake up kids
1933 2018-02-20 21:52:31 But they are out of stocks, they would need to bump stocks first.  This ban will only bump stocks out of stock.
1934 2018-02-20 21:52:29 I don’t have a strong feeling one way or the other on a ban on bump stocks—but anyone who feels strongly about it should realize it is a meaningless symbolic gesture that changes little.
1935 2018-02-20 21:52:29 Trump’s also trying to distract from one of his lawyers pleading guilty of lying to investigators. 

Funny how #Trump chose that time to suddenly announce the proposed ban on bump stocks. He had months since #Vegas #shootings to do that.
Anything to distract from #Russiameddling
1936 2018-02-20 21:52:26 Trump just offered up the most expedient, least politically damaging crumbs with banning bump stocks. No doubt this qualifies, for him and the GOP, as “doing something “.  Nice try. Now how about the hard work it will take to make it hard for those with mental health issues?
1937 2018-02-20 21:52:23 The @NRA is getting scared. Bump Stocks is an easy concession floated months ago but is now being conceded as a tribute. They're worried, it's working. Don't back down. Keep pushing. #Resist #NeverAgain #NoMoreThoughtsAndPrayers
1938 2018-02-20 21:52:23 Who knows where slide fire stocks are in stock? Or have a used stock they’d like to get rid of?  I’m a little late I know.
1939 2018-02-20 21:52:12 Un dato a buscar: cómo cambió la venta de "bump stocks" en las armerías tras el anuncio de Trump.
1940 2018-02-20 21:52:12 gotta get my stocks up the next 6
1941 2018-02-20 21:52:11 Actually the 2nd amendment covers bump stocks, ALL Arms, any offensive or defensive weapon, including but not limited to Firearms,chair legs, water cannons,super soaker 2000.
1942 2018-02-20 21:52:07 Banning bump stocks is kinda like adding 10 drops of water to an empty pool - yes it's a good start but not nearly enough to make a huge enough differnce.
1943 2018-02-20 21:51:58 Trump has proposed enhanced background checks and outlawing bump stocks so far
1944 2018-02-20 21:51:53 @POTUS @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr Need strong gun legislation outlawing Automatic weapons, Bump stocks, prevent mentally ill from owning guns requiring all buyers to have a psychiatrist, mandatory police protection for schools & require gun sellers to be responsible 4 buyers actions
1945 2018-02-20 21:51:48 All of the sudden all the 2nd amendment arguments are, “Bump stocks aren’t guns so that’s ok but they won’t take my high capacity magazine”.
1946 2018-02-20 21:51:45 @realDonaldTrump TODAY I COMEND YOU! A BABY STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.  TODAY A LOOK AT  “BUMP STOCKS”. TMRW WHO KNOWS! 

M̤̈Ä̤K̤̈Ë̤ Ä̤M̤̈Ë̤R̤̈Ï̤C̤̈Ä̤ S̤̈Ä̤F̤̈Ë̤ Ä̤G̤̈Ä̤Ï̤N̤̈!
1947 2018-02-20 21:51:32 Las Vegas shooting was 5 months ago now trump is talking about banning bump stocks. The Florida school shooting happened a week ago & the shooter didn’t use a bump stock. What good is this doing? Far too little way too late. Lazy coward trump!
1948 2018-02-20 21:51:31 And we ain’t just talkin about no stinkin bump stocks!  Control it all!
1949 2018-02-20 21:51:28 Ugh!!! Big difference between "Machine Guns" & Automatic Weapons. But that's ok. Rate of fire, sustained rate of fire, & typically belt fed, although some can be magazine fed. Agree that bump stocks need to go but they don't make a rifle a machine gun. Replicates Automatic Rifle!
1950 2018-02-20 21:51:25 Bump stocks are worthless anyways still think it’s messed up it didn’t go to a vote.
1951 2018-02-20 21:51:22 Trump directs AG to ban bump stocks -
1 Without a law?
2 Why wait so long after Vegas shooting?
3 NRA never supported bump stocks
So, WTH?
1952 2018-02-20 21:51:21 I just saw your CNN interview. Your strength is inspiring. It’s great that Trump is “looking” at bump stocks. The Vegas massacre was LAST OCTOBER. The ban should of already happened. Trump got 30 million from NRA. What makes u think he will change??
1953 2018-02-20 21:51:18 Genius! Why didn't I think of that!?! Buy. Stocks. Higher.. word
1954 2018-02-20 21:51:17 “Hey Jeff, what’s the absolute least we could do to stop mass shootings, but still make it look like we did something.”
“We could ban bump stocks, sir.”
“I dunno”
“It’d get you a win. Almost everyone seems to be onboard. You could take credit.”
“Ok, yeah. Write that one up.”
1955 2018-02-20 21:51:09 Most people who shoot are more concerned about hitting their target, bump stocks negate that.
1956 2018-02-20 21:51:08 Trump directs attorney general Jeff Sessions to create regulations to ban 'bump stocks' and other devices that turn semi-automatic firearms into automatic weapons.
1957 2018-02-20 21:51:04 Trump just banned bump stocks..
1958 2018-02-20 21:51:02 @robert_madison Carefully thought out and timed strategy to change the discussion and try to appear to be the savior. Bump stocks are only part of the problem. ALL assault weapons need to be banned, not just the ability to modify guns.
1959 2018-02-20 21:51:01 Wow Trump just banned bump stocks
1960 2018-02-20 21:50:59 @realDonaldTrump good work on trying to eliminate bump stocks. Not perfect but it is a start !
1961 2018-02-20 21:50:57 I’m under the impression that bump stocks were to be used by persons who are handicapped and need the devices to shoot as they may have one arm,hand or missing fingers? If so a Dr could prescribe like they do with handicap parking ?
1962 2018-02-20 21:50:52 Trump just issued an executive order to ban Bump stocks...
1963 2018-02-20 21:50:48 ...and now we wait for Cult 45 to say that they have always been in favor of banning bump stocks.

#bumpstocks
1964 2018-02-20 21:50:35 My take is that Sessions will say bump stocks, on cue, that bump stocks don't turn M-16s into machine guns hence a nothing burger.
Think he's pissed Obama was number 8 on the Presidents list, Moving up, and he was last..
1965 2018-02-20 21:50:34 keep on buying us stocks they r so cheap
1966 2018-02-20 21:50:33 Rep. Hernandez @djblp, thank you for your work for #GunSense. I’m so disappointed that AZ GOP lawmakers chose not to hear bill banning bump stocks. @MomsDemand is watching and will #ThrowThemOut #AZleg
1967 2018-02-20 21:50:32 I'm delighted to hear this.  Banning the sales of bump stocks is long overdue.
1968 2018-02-20 21:50:30 No, there are many alternatives besides insurance and confiscation! Lol, federal background checks, banning bump stocks, high capacity mag ban, safe storage laws, etc. Many guns should be confiscated or turned in anyway
1969 2018-02-20 21:50:29 On gun devices? Trump is a joke. That does nothing to curve mass shootings. This kid in Florida didn’t use bump stocks. The Sutherland springs shooter didn’t use bump stocks, the Orlando shooter didn’t use bump stocks, San Bernardino shooters didn’t use bump stocks.
1970 2018-02-20 21:50:29 Bye bye bump stocks . Only issue with that, people can use a belt and do the same thing.  #2A #GunControl @realDonaldTrump
1971 2018-02-20 21:50:27 I'm a firm 2A supporter, and I couldn't care less if bump stocks are banned. They are not protected by the constitution and make the firearm more difficult to control. I've tried one & never wanted to try again.
1972 2018-02-20 21:50:25 I'm legitimately interested to see how this shakes out. Bump stocks are a relatively simple technology that has serious consequences. Machine guns have been heavily restricted since the 1930s.
1973 2018-02-20 21:50:23 Trump says he signed a memorandum directing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to propose regulations that ban all devices (bump stocks) that turn legal weapons into "machine guns", expects regulations to be finalized "very soon."
1974 2018-02-20 21:50:22 Exactly, bump stocks were used in 1 recent mass shooting...how many times has an AR-15 or similar assault weapons been used? Wouldn’t have to ban bump stocks of assault style weapons are banned.
1975 2018-02-20 21:50:13 @realDonaldTrump first bump stocks, then what? You want to keep my vote and the vote of all your followers, you should stop there. #DontMessWithMy2nd.
1976 2018-02-20 21:50:05 Look up the actual US Code section, under (b): “26 U.S. Code § 5845”

It’s the ‘single function of the trigger’ part that’s the sticking point w/ bump stocks as they only fire one rd per function of the trigger & hence don’t fit the definition.

Nothing to do w/ ‘sustained fire’
1977 2018-02-20 21:50:03 TRUMP'S PATHETICALLY TRANSPARENT MOVE TO ELIMINATE BUMP STOCKS IS LAUGHABLE. LIKE USING BIRTH CONTROL AFTER SEX.
1978 2018-02-20 21:50:02 Months after Las Vegas, Trump moves to deal with least controversial step - banning bump stocks whose purpose only serves to mimic full auto mode.

This is Trump's grand gesture to try and get attention off NRA/GOP malfeasance.
1979 2018-02-20 21:50:01 Just read an article on how @realDonaldTrump has called on Rob Sessions to work on banning ‘bump stocks’ — it’s a start #guncontrol 
1980 2018-02-20 21:49:57 No bump stocks were used in Florida.
1981 2018-02-20 21:49:51 Considering bump stocks haven't been used in any of the mass shootings, I guess you could say it's something but it wouldn't have saved any lives. I have yet to see any gun regulation being proposed that would have. 
1982 2018-02-20 21:49:51 In the idiocy that is the @NRA's slippery slope, give-no-millimeter approach to gun safety legislation, I will take trump's ban on bump stocks.  Every hole in the dam brings it closer to falling.  It's a start. #bumpstocks #NRA
1983 2018-02-20 21:49:47 In all the mass shootings Bump stocks was used how many times? 
Maybe once? 
And AR-15s? 
Definitely more than once so where is the significance of this move to ban bump stocks?
1984 2018-02-20 21:49:45 In very few States do people actually own assault rifles. This past shooting, the rifle used was nothing more than a scary looking hunting rifle. Things like bump stocks and high-capacity magazines have to be first. Assault weapon laws are currently at the state level.
1985 2018-02-20 21:49:43 Bureau of Alcohol tobacco etc has already ruled that bump stocks don’t do this so- so much for empty gestures.
1986 2018-02-20 21:49:42 This happened after the vegas shooting. The result was a mad rush of people  buying bump stocks. Then months later they determined not to band bump stocks.
1987 2018-02-20 21:49:35 I see the Trump Administration is prepared to throw a bone to the gun law reform movement by banning bump stocks. Which were involved in ONE mass shooting. Then they can safely say “see, we did something”. 

“Kill the NRA” “Sarah Sanders”
1988 2018-02-20 21:49:30 There's at least a 50% chance Trump thinks bump stocks have something to do with the Dow.
1989 2018-02-20 21:49:27 Start with bump stocks, ban assault weapons like AR15, ban kids under 21 from owning them... maybe ban NRA from buying out politicians to keep them quiet. Crazy to assume it's guns or no guns, with no middle ground. Seat belts, age limits make driving safer & U still can drive.
1990 2018-02-20 21:49:24 Wow @realDonaldTrump trying to ban bump stocks bet the @NRA will love that 
1991 2018-02-20 21:49:21 No bump stocks were used in Florida.
1992 2018-02-20 21:49:20 Yes, bump stocks are the problem. All we have to do is get rid of bump stocks and everything will be fine... SMH. What a stupid conversation this has become, thanks to the @NRA and the @GOP.
1993 2018-02-20 21:49:20 Bump stocks?! Don thinks he can sway anyone’s opinion when he is ineffective, illegitimate, and a liar. Good luck on ridding plastic pieces added to semi auto rifles! Great start? Maybe next let’s get automatic rifles meant for war out of civilian hands!
1994 2018-02-20 21:49:15 I think this is a good move, although bump stocks are incredibly easy to make yourself. Probably won't be very effective if someone really wants one.
1995 2018-02-20 21:49:12 Took him 4 months and another dreadful shooting to finally talk about bump stocks. Forgive while I hold off on my applause for someone who's only now speaking up because his hand is being forced by the deaths of innocent kids.
1996 2018-02-20 21:49:11 Who is with @POTUS on this, devices like bump stocks that change Non automatic guns to Fully automatic guns should be banned?  I say yes.
Btw,  Obama made bump stocks legal.
1997 2018-02-20 21:49:11 The important piece to look for is whether Trump is just banning bump stocks, or all similar type devices (trigger cranks, autoglove-like devices, and future iterations that do the same thing but go by a different name).
1998 2018-02-20 21:49:10 @jimcramer hey jim, ive been following your mad money shows for years, but never tweeted to you before. i have march 16 $175 calls for $fb and bought $85 calls for $exr before the long weekend for march as well.  What are your thoughts on these stocks.
1999 2018-02-20 21:49:04 So let’s see:
Nevada suffers one of the worst mass shootings in history. And people call for the ban of bump stocks and WH ignores. 17 kids mercilessly killed and kids who survived calling for ban of assault rifles. WH bans bump stocks. DEFLECTING MUCH!!!
2000 2018-02-20 21:49:00 Presidente @realDonaldTrump declara que ha ordenado al fiscal general, Jeff Sessions, proponer cambios que prohibirían los llamados "bump stocks" o aceleradores de disparos.
2001 2018-02-20 21:48:58 Stop selling the assault rifles and you wouldn’t have to ban bump stocks.
2002 2018-02-20 21:48:54 I give credit where credit it due.  Banning bump stocks is a very good decision.  Of course, Paul Ryan should have brought that bill to the floor in the House to make the ban permanent, but nevertheless, it’s a step in the right direction.
2003 2018-02-20 21:48:53 So what are the #guncontrol zealots going to complain about now? Bump stocks Betting they dont give any @POTUS thx!
2004 2018-02-20 21:48:50 #Editorial I see banning bump stocks as a worthless gesture. The Left won't be satisfied and it won't actually do anything. It's a silly thing to compromise on and sets bad precedent.
2005 2018-02-20 21:48:49 “Look, I’m working to curb gun violence! I banned bump stocks!!” When in reality he and his admin know this won’t have any effect. This is just another “look what I did, aren’t I the best?!?!?”
2006 2018-02-20 21:48:49 Right, just more Republican B.S. A year from now, nothing will have been done - probably not even legislation against bump stocks.
2007 2018-02-20 21:48:40 We have a new Fed Boss, and a very inexperienced Treasury Sec, a dollar in free fall, and plebs bidding stocks like its Viagra… This is a good time to revisit position risk, assuming your not a Gartman investor...
2008 2018-02-20 21:48:38 What is the purpose of a bump stock? How would it work with hunting? Personal defense? I’m not saying guns need to be banned, but bump stocks????? There’s no need for them.
2009 2018-02-20 21:48:37 Big deal! It won't happen! NRA will say no! Bump stocks were supposed to be addressed after Vegas - DID NOT DO! No one, but Military, should have access to assault weapons! There is no arguments to justify people having these!
2010 2018-02-20 21:48:36 It's a smoke screen. "See, I am for gun control, you can't buy bump stocks".
2011 2018-02-20 21:48:30 Not trading in the zone atm. Taking less risk and trade less since stocks declined but still don't like my trading right now.. Not as relaxed as before. Will probably reduce even further until it feels like "business as usual" again
2012 2018-02-20 21:48:29 Banning bump stocks is a good first step, but just a first step. #CommonSenseGunLaws
2013 2018-02-20 21:48:26 Guns don't kill people, people and bump stocks kill people.
2014 2018-02-20 21:48:25 Ban of semi-automatic #gun bump stocks was recommended by @realDonaldTrump. Could banning the #guns used in the #LA #shooting last year also have positive impact on the case of common school shootings in #USA?
#FloridaSchoolShooting #GunReformNow #GunControlNow #Bumpstock
2015 2018-02-20 21:48:24 PS.  The house passed a bill to outlaw these but it is setting in the Senate.  Guess no one told POTUS this is pending.  They also have not told him that since Obama allowed bump stocks by EO he can undo with a EO.
2016 2018-02-20 21:48:20 Very sad that you caved and will allow the banning of bump stocks.  Seen as an infringement of the 2nd to many.
2017 2018-02-20 21:48:19 "Trump wil verbod 'bump stocks' vanwege schietpartij Las Vegas"
2018 2018-02-20 21:48:16 Seriously. Do you have children. Here’s the solution. Ban assault weapons and bump stocks.
2019 2018-02-20 21:48:12 @realDonaldTrump You are such a half ass President! U try to fool people with Ur big bravado of telling the AG to put a ban on bump stocks! Those are a fraction of weapons in this country that need banning AR-15 is what murdered children & adults in Fla!
2020 2018-02-20 21:48:10 Even though I’ve learned to expect nothing from Republicans on guns, I’m still shocked that a bump stock law can’t make it through Congress. Who the Hell is for bump stocks?!
2021 2018-02-20 21:48:10 @realDonaldTrump
@FoxNews
@GOP
Uhh... Sandy Hook, Aurora, Parkland, Pulse... shooters didn't use bump stocks. 

This is a drop in the ocean.
2022 2018-02-20 21:48:05 Yes they will! The bump stocks ban may move forward not even close to enough. NRAhas gone too far taking repubs with them!
2023 2018-02-20 21:48:01 President Trump directs AG Sessions to propose a ban on bump stocks, the accessory that makes a semi-automatic weapon fire more like an automatic one.
2024 2018-02-20 21:48:01 The bump stocks were already being discussed since Vegas.
If law abiding citizens want guns that they should have them BUT kids have no business having access to buy their own guns like a AR15 or assault weapons.
2025 2018-02-20 21:47:58 Bump stocks should be outlawed. Banning gun stocks is not implementing common sense gun control!! Keep fighting!!
2026 2018-02-20 21:47:56 Vegas Shooting happened 4 months ago.  Congress has put bump stocks on the back burner. I'll believe it when I see it.
2027 2018-02-20 21:47:53 @CNN @FoxNews @NBCNews   while your so -called reporters were shouting nonsense @PressSec @realDonaldTrump  wrote EO to ban bump stocks & all modifiers Also why would Trump advertise to PUTIN what is coming
2028 2018-02-20 21:47:48 Did the review of bump stocks and a couple rounds of golf interfere with the review of the #releasethememos?
2029 2018-02-20 21:47:47 Bump stocks didn't kill the kids in Parkland.
2030 2018-02-20 21:47:43 Let's just do what Canada did: No armor piercing ammunition, minimum barrel length on handguns, no bump or bullpuo stocks, no suppressors, no rifle magazines larger than 5 rounds, no handgun magazines larger than 10 rounds, and no more than six episodes for Sean Cullen's sitcom
2031 2018-02-20 21:47:43 He's asking them to complete a review started in December. My money is on the DOJ deciding not to regulate bump stocks.
2032 2018-02-20 21:47:42 I am for a full ban, but this is a good start since the bump stocks convert rifles into automatic weapons. It just needs to go further.
2033 2018-02-20 21:47:41 No. It’s not even enough... it’s moving laterally. Bump stocks are rarely used in all gun crimes. This is more a placebo than anything.
2034 2018-02-20 21:47:41 I couldn't agree with you more! I will be looking into steps we can take at the state level throughout the coming Interim, as well as continuing to push my bill to ban bump stocks which I introduced earlier this year.
2035 2018-02-20 21:47:38 Im very pro-gun but Im cool with this. We don't need bump stocks.
2036 2018-02-20 21:47:37 @realDonaldTrump is banning bump stocks (a good thing) and I would like to see what liberals can figure out to complain about
2037 2018-02-20 21:47:36 Meaningless also because NRA is agreeable to banning bump stocks.
2038 2018-02-20 21:47:36 @realDonaldTrump @GunOwners @NRA @jameswoods I'm sorry Mr President but this is the one time I have to disagree with you. It's not about Bump Stocks, it's about giving an inch and they take 10 miles. Leave the 2A alone!
2039 2018-02-20 21:47:36 Yes, DNC vs Democrats vs Walmart vs Walton family. Organizations/Stocks/Memberships/Descriptors. We all know what he/she/ze meant. Your example with Walmart...if you are literally killing Walmart (2 billion shareholders: 50%of shares owned by family) you would kill the Waltons...
2040 2018-02-20 21:47:30 NOW Trump wants to ban bump stocks? Does he think this will appease the FL teenagers who want to ban AR-15s? Those kids are gonna call BS for sure.
2041 2018-02-20 21:47:28 #Trump says he's looking into banning Bump Stocks and his base flips out.  So hopefully this will have the desired outcome of him having a 0% approval rating.
2042 2018-02-20 21:47:25 He didn't say "bump stocks".
Report WHAT he says.
2043 2018-02-20 21:47:17 Fully automatic weapons are illegal anyway! I hope u know what a bump stocks does when modified to a gun
2044 2018-02-20 21:47:16 Banning bump stocks is a step in the right direction @realDonaldTrump, but keep going: increase private gun ownership age to 21.  NOW! #guncontrol #GunReformNow #GunControlNow #Parkland #SandyHook #BREAKING #BreakingNews
2045 2018-02-20 21:47:10 Why don’t we just ban the weapons these stocks are used on, wouldn’t that solve the problem?
2046 2018-02-20 21:47:09 President Trump, facing pressure on gun control, said he ordered regulations to ban “bump stocks,” which make semi-automatic guns more lethal -- NYTimes
2047 2018-02-20 21:47:08 Bump stocks...another horrible policy passed by Obama.
2048 2018-02-20 21:47:03 Banning bump stocks is a good move in the right direction. Good on @realDonaldTrump for once.
Not nearly enough though.
2049 2018-02-20 21:47:03 Given that the main reason bump stocks are legal to begin with is due to a regulator ruling by BATF (as I understand it, correct me if I'm wrong) why wouldn't they?
2050 2018-02-20 21:46:58 Trump demanding sessions issue a ban on bump stocks 4 months after the Vegas shooting occurred..just days after a high school shooting killed 17 kids(without a bump stock) is an absolute joke and a total facade. Trump only did this now to make it seem like he is doing something
2051 2018-02-20 21:46:57 @cvpayne Since steel is being talked about so heavily, of these 4 stocks, which would you invest in? X, STLD, NUE, and RS. In what rank would you put them?
2052 2018-02-20 21:46:55 Defn a good start Pres Trump about bump stocks. Take it 1 step further, ban assault rifles from anyone under the age of 21, then maybe infrastructure’s got a chance passing b4 the end of the year which will keep Republicans & u in office.
2053 2018-02-20 21:46:49 Does anyone know if he could have just signed an executive order banning bump stocks?
2054 2018-02-20 21:46:48 Bell Potter can see a profitable turnaround building at Temple & Webster $TPW. Buy. Price target lifts to 65c from 55c #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities
2055 2018-02-20 21:46:48 Funny, I don't recall mention of bump stocks being used in Florida @potus.  It was a semi-automatic AR-15!
2056 2018-02-20 21:46:46 Stocks? Lol
2057 2018-02-20 21:46:43 Bill Clinton was the one who allowed bump stocks in the first place
2058 2018-02-20 21:46:41 No bump stocks were used in Florida.
2059 2018-02-20 21:46:40 .@POTUS @realDonaldTrump  You’ve asked AG to consider legislation to ban bump stocks? That represents about 0.00001% of the problem, something the @NRA would be ok trading off if you promise to not ban anything else. And reading a prepared speech, not from your heart?
2060 2018-02-20 21:46:36 President Donald Trump @POTUS announced he has ordered Attorney General Jeff Sessions to take steps to ban bump stocks, the type of gun modification that Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock used to kill 58 people in October.
2061 2018-02-20 21:46:33 Weren't bump stocks from that other time a lot of people were killed and the GOP didn't give a damn?
2062 2018-02-20 21:46:29 #dems once again #outoftouch . How are your stocks going to be during the buy back #dems complaining about? #pathetic #obstructionists #crywolf
2063 2018-02-20 21:46:25 Banning bump stocks is a smokescreen. They were used once and may not have added to the body count at all. NRA supports gun purchases. Banning bump stocks is immaterial and a bandaid on a gaping chest wound. Go big. Ban assault weapons.
2064 2018-02-20 21:46:19 I don’t see how bump stocks aren’t illegal already
2065 2018-02-20 21:46:11 I heard trumps touching the tip of the iceberg by starting a ban on bump stocks etc!  A good thing. But why not just ban all semi autos !
2066 2018-02-20 21:46:04 Moving to ban Bump Stocks is the right decision. Politics aside - @realDonaldTrump made the right choice, and likely will lose political capital as a result. #Trump #politics #BlueWave
2067 2018-02-20 21:46:03 President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho Small Hands moves to ban bump stocks.  That’s the least he could do. 

No, really. That’s the LEAST he could do.
2068 2018-02-20 21:46:01 Congress was looking into doing something about bump stocks after the Las Vegas shooting. Of course, the tax rearrangement had priority.
2069 2018-02-20 21:45:59 Wait so it takes a second shooting that doesn’t seem to have involved bump stocks to achieve a bump stock ban? Even WITH NRA support? Yikes.
2070 2018-02-20 21:45:57 Bump stocks is one tiny step. Do not let them make this small change & call it a victory for gun safety. We need to reinstate the ban on assault rifles, limit multi=round ammo, expanded b/g checks, and if you're mentally ill or on the terrorist no-fly list, no gun access for you.
2071 2018-02-20 21:45:57 Him and the NRA both stated that bump stocks needed to banned after Vegas... Why question a move in the right direction?
2072 2018-02-20 21:45:53 No more bump stocks. Didnt know what a bump stock was til the Vegas massacre so i could care less for this ban
2073 2018-02-20 21:45:51 bump stocks are an awfully easy bone to throw
2074 2018-02-20 21:45:49 Banning bump stocks is a good thing and possibly the only thing trump has planned to do that i feel is good for the country .
2075 2018-02-20 21:45:49 Murphy U R so full of BS THE DEM had 60 votes in 2010 what did U guys do? U guys did nothing but flap ur lips collect ur donors money & get fat. NRA said make bump stocks illegal & u guys sat on ur rich asses did nothing. Let face it congress is there enrich themselves-U all suck
2076 2018-02-20 21:45:38 Banning bump stocks will do nothing. It is such a hollow gesture.
2077 2018-02-20 21:45:37 You're generous Brian. Boo to bump stocks. And what is left behind. Are you comfortable with that? I just bought a bump stock for my fountain pen..Its called a convertor. I can spew lots more ink. Stick to the main message like the kids do. Cheers
2078 2018-02-20 21:45:27 Bump stocks just got the #TrumpBump #sorrynotsorry ! Krrp up the work everyone! The pressure is working!
2079 2018-02-20 21:45:22 @realDonaldTrump I'm 35 years old, and the ONLY vote I have ever cast for POTUS was for you.  If you illegally and unconstitutionally ban "bump stocks," I'm sitting out the 2020 election.
2080 2018-02-20 21:45:18 The NRA itself has proposed regulations on bump stocks and NRA members I spoke with after both shootings seem fine w/regulations. I can;t imagine this will hurt Trump's standing there
2081 2018-02-20 21:45:18 Super Retail Group $SUL downgraded to Hold from Buy @Bell_Potter, price target $7.35 (was $9.90) as competitive dynamics bite #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities
2082 2018-02-20 21:45:17 Directing AG Sessions to ban bump stocks is a big mistake! GOP going to be hurt in and at the polls. Time to focus on the real problem: sick people! Need to keep them away from society, not just guns!
2083 2018-02-20 21:45:13 A ban on bump stocks is a policy that Trump can reflect on as achievements. Better late than never, he's doing something.
2084 2018-02-20 21:45:08 Bump stocks were always going to be a sacrificial lamb.  They are cheap, and really don't add much lethality to the weapon itself in most situations.  The NRA would love to throw them on the fire and let "that be that."
2085 2018-02-20 21:45:06 President Trump orders AG to craft regulations banning “bump stocks” and other devices that turn semi-automatic firearms into automatic weapons.
2086 2018-02-20 21:45:05 we're now back to bump stocks, because the NRA voted and decided this was literally the least they'd be willing to concede
2087 2018-02-20 21:45:02 That’s dumb. Bump stocks being banned isn’t going to cause/prevent anything.
2088 2018-02-20 21:45:00 So what! This ban on bump stocks should’ve been done after Las Vegas massacre! This is just garbage, meaningless not worth the ink spent on printing it! I’m sure Trump spoke to NRA asking them if it was ok with them that he put this meaningless ban on bump-stocks out!
2089 2018-02-20 21:44:59 Well folks, buy your bump stocks while you can
2090 2018-02-20 21:44:57 One thing is certain—any bill that bans bump stocks will trigger the cranks in Congress.
2091 2018-02-20 21:44:53 @POTUS please do not start down the slippery slope, don’t take the bait on bump stocks. 
You said you support 2A. Stand firm and don’t believe that you can make a deal with the Dems. Dem & Devil start with the same letters, and they honor deals the same way.
2092 2018-02-20 21:44:47 So Trump has indicated he wants bump stocks banned, rather than semi-automatic rifles!  Almost as if he found a half measure that keeps the NRA money coming his way.
2093 2018-02-20 21:44:42 I been one of your biggest supporters I really hope what I heard is not true that you are trying to urge the band of bump stocks and components like that hate to lose trust in when I have seen to be the best president ever. @realDonaldTrump
2094 2018-02-20 21:44:39 Pretty much. The cost benefit analysis from the gun manufacturers here is:

Which will cost us more money? Banning AR-15's or Bump Stocks.
2095 2018-02-20 21:44:37 Banning bump stocks is akin to using a band aide on a water pipe leak.
It's a staged move to accomplish very little. Get rid of the AR-15's and stop screwing around.
2096 2018-02-20 21:44:35 The only bump stocks he cares about is his share prices
2097 2018-02-20 21:44:30 Trump not missing a chance to blame the Obama admin in his memo on bump stocks: "Although the Obama Administration repeatedly concluded that particular bump stock type devices were lawful to purchase and possess, I sought further clarification of the law."
2098 2018-02-20 21:44:28 No bump stocks? Fine. I've got belt loops. Sure, firing from the waist isn't as accurate, but it matters less when you're spraying bullets.

WE MUST OUTLAW BELT LOOPS!!! - next argument to  be made
2099 2018-02-20 21:44:25 Bump stocks are one part of it. What was their other legislation in those 10 months to deal with mass shootings?
2100 2018-02-20 21:44:20 He’s not banning bump stocks, he’s punting the process to Sessions
2101 2018-02-20 21:44:16 Trump's memorandum to Sessions references the time it will take for notice and comment on a new rule banning bump stocks: 

"Although I desire swift and decisive action, I remain committed to the rule of law and to the procedures the law prescribes."
2102 2018-02-20 21:44:11 @jaketapper, bingo caller for @CNN, the network down 30% from last year, asking a FLA HS student on a bus her thoughts on @realDonaldTrump saying he’ll ban bump stocks. 
“Did that just happen?” 
Jake: “Hurble burble burble…”
Great TV.
2103 2018-02-20 21:44:10 That’s all well and good... but... that’s it?  Bump stocks?
2104 2018-02-20 21:44:09 Bump stocks were made for the disabled so .....
2105 2018-02-20 21:44:06 @realDonaldTrump By what authority does the J.D. have to ban bump stocks?  You are NOT the legislative branch. You are just another power hungry wanna-be dictator.
2106 2018-02-20 21:44:02 Maybe he thinks bump stocks are things to be avoided on the Dow Jones Index.
2107 2018-02-20 21:44:01 Kids don’t be distracted. Bump stocks are only a piece of the puzzle. More needs to be done.  You will need to vote in 2018 like your lives depend on it.  The do! #MarchForOurLives #VoteThemOut #GunLawsNOW
2108 2018-02-20 21:43:59 If bump stocks are bad because they turn other guns into automatic weapons,.............why are automatic weapons not modified by bump stocks OK? #ParklandSchoolShooting @shannonrwatts
2109 2018-02-20 21:43:57 Trump just banned bump stocks on weapons... GREAT PROGRESS
2110 2018-02-20 21:43:57 Bump stocks weren't used in the Florida massacre.
2111 2018-02-20 21:43:55 My take: This is the NRA trying to silence outrage about gun violence, they have probably okayed Trumps magical pronouncement about banning bump stocks.

Not. even. close. to. enough.

Not gonna shut up about it. Neither are those teens from Parkland.
2112 2018-02-20 21:43:50 Trump is coming for your bump stocks #MAGA

So. Much. Winning.
2113 2018-02-20 21:43:44 The fact that @realDonaldTrump thinks he can blunt the impact of the #StonemanDouglasHighSchool students by banning bump stocks that weren't used in the shooting at their school is mind-numbingly stupid.
2114 2018-02-20 21:43:40 I am pretty sure the Obama administration was not gleefully in favor of bump stocks.  The dude just get past the black guy who was a better president.
2115 2018-02-20 21:43:30 Sofie, one of the Parkland student leaders, just said while his order to propose a ban on bump stocks is a step, it would not have saved her classmates at Parkland.  I love these extraordinarily aware and highly informed students!
2116 2018-02-20 21:43:25 Let him have his silly, derpy jab this time as long as the bump stocks disappear. Pick your battles with children.
2117 2018-02-20 21:43:19 Banning bump stocks has no effect on guns; Trump will do anything except stand up to the NRA. He’s very weak. Banning bump stocks in no way addresses the problem of assault weapons in civilian hands. Children will die unless we act. Trump is weak.
2118 2018-02-20 21:43:14 So does this apply specifically to bump stocks?
2119 2018-02-20 21:43:12 Cool idea to ban bump stocks like the one used in the Parkland shooting.

<checks facts>

Oh.
2120 2018-02-20 21:43:08 Enforcement is not creating. Might want to learn the difference. Bump stocks were approved for sale based on how the law was "interpreted" under DOJ rules. This is totally within scope of DOJ enforcement activities.
2121 2018-02-20 21:43:07 @realDonaldTrump If you actually want to ban bump stocks you will lose all of your support, including mine. Don't be a dumbass.
2122 2018-02-20 21:43:05 i haven't been on twt for 2 days bcs i was hella busy, and it's foundation week, and i bought all their stocks on wanna one posters, and bought 2 postcards of ongniel, and i'm gonna buy the stickers today, i'm gonna be broke omyghod
2123 2018-02-20 21:43:03 NRA and gun advocates R saying its too late, bump stocks already plentiful in the market. SOOO, Step 2 needs to be announcing, in collaboration w a leading retailer, a bump stock turn-in program, exchanging for gift cert/store discounts, etc. Then melt them all down in public!
2124 2018-02-20 21:43:00 He just signed a memo directing the justice department to ban bump stocks. He’s meeting with all parties involved and bringing governors in to discuss how we should start addressing mental health. What is your solution? Resist?
2125 2018-02-20 21:42:49 @POTUS ban of bump stocks? For the first time since you have been president I am very disappointed in you
2126 2018-02-20 21:42:41 Lisa, you’re drinking the Kool-Aid. Banning bump stocks has no effect on guns; he will do anything except stand up to the NRA. He’s very weak. Banning bump stocks in no way addresses the problem of assault weapons in civilian hands. Children will die unless we act. Trump is weak.
2127 2018-02-20 21:42:39 @realDonaldTrump is now asking DOJ to outlaw bump stocks. Yet he reversed a bill that required background checks on mentally ill people and is the NRA’s champion. Too little, too late? Or, doing the least he can to relieve political pressure? #Parkland #NRABloodMoney #gunsense
2128 2018-02-20 21:42:38 And yet, here's Trump, getting ready to issue an Executive Order and bypass Congress to ban bump stocks. I guess not all EO's are bad. 
2129 2018-02-20 21:42:37 He has no power to do it. Bump stocks have to be made illegal through Congress first. Smoke and mirrors.
2130 2018-02-20 21:42:36 President Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks
2131 2018-02-20 21:42:35 Well b4 anyone wet their pants, please consider. Trump talks 2 the NRA & ask what can he give these teenagers? The NRA  says "bump stocks" Trump give the order 2 Sessions & all of a sudden, it's problem solved. Please!!!!
2132 2018-02-20 21:42:30 I have $47 with which to buy stocks. What should I do?
2133 2018-02-20 21:42:23 Bump stocks aren't weapons...only part of the problem but a good start.... he still needs to do a lot more to address the issue. #AR15
2134 2018-02-20 21:42:21 ban on bump stocks
2135 2018-02-20 21:42:20 Bracing for a wave of credulous "bump stocks" coverage ...
2136 2018-02-20 21:42:20 Banning all guns will never be passed. The 2nd Amendment will guarantee that. I have not heard any people of power suggest that anyway. But banning types of guns like assault rifles, and certain accessories, like extended mags and bump stocks, I can support.
2137 2018-02-20 21:42:18 No, but the AG is part of the executive branch. The executive branch enforces the laws set by the Congress and does so by creating regulations and regulatory bodies. POTUS directed the AG to look at whether bump-stocks are legal under current law.
2138 2018-02-20 21:42:18 "Despite the fact that the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions.." 
2139 2018-02-20 21:42:17 Wow, Trump just signed a memo asking sessions to work on making bump stocks illegal.
2140 2018-02-20 21:42:13 Four months later and Trump finally does something about bump stocks. Does this mean he'll take action on AR-15s sometime around June?
2141 2018-02-20 21:42:12 Altium $ALU upgraded by Bell Potter to Buy from Hold with price target $17 (was $13) but... share price rallied well past that price level yesterday... #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities
2142 2018-02-20 21:42:02 So do you think bump stocks should continue to be allowed?
2143 2018-02-20 21:42:01 So no gear expert, but regarding bump stocks, couldn’t you get the same basic effect with a zip tie? Anything to hold the trigger in place?
2144 2018-02-20 21:41:57 Listen I don’t like Trump, but let’s give him the benefit of doubt maybe he will ban bump stocks.  We can’t sit around and complain. We must act!
2145 2018-02-20 21:41:56 Right! I see no practical purpose for those stocks, but if a guy makes his own, what do you do?
2146 2018-02-20 21:41:52 Bump stocks were not used in #VegasShooting
2147 2018-02-20 21:41:49 So-called bump stocks, which are legal, convert semi-automatic rifles into rapid-fire weapons.
2148 2018-02-20 21:41:45 14 day waiting periods
No sales by private owners
No sales at gun shows
10 round magazine limit
No bump stocks
No cranks
Licenses for all arms
Child lock requirements
Minimum age of purchase at 21
Assault rifle ban
Universal background checks
Domestic violence ban
2149 2018-02-20 21:41:44 "bump stocks" don't matter. Background checks do. Waiting times do. Mental checks do.
2150 2018-02-20 21:41:43 Tho I despise what he stands for and tho I do not support anything he proposes, proposing a ban on bump stocks after the terrible shooting in Las Vegas is a big step forward on gun control. Thank you Mr. President @realDonaldTrump
2151 2018-02-20 21:41:43 The memo Trump signed on bump stocks, includes this line: "Although the Obama Administration repeatedly concluded that particular bump stock type devices were lawful to purchase and possess, I sought further clarification of the law restricting fully automatic machine guns."
2152 2018-02-20 21:41:42 nothing done lots done assault weapon ban expired not renew drop mental illness easier to get a gun now for those folks bump stocks ban today by executive order will be challenged so a lot as be done ari party before country
2153 2018-02-20 21:41:39 The President is hosting a forum with students, teachers, LEO, etc. this week to talk about what is to be done.  He also sent a memorandum (researched since last December) encouraging a law banning bump stocks.  I wish you people paid attention!
2154 2018-02-20 21:41:38 "Despite the fact that the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions.." 
2155 2018-02-20 21:41:38 Banning bump stocks is great. Banning them now is a way to divert the conversation away from assault rifles, period. Don't let them do it.
2156 2018-02-20 21:41:25 @realDonaldTrump FOOLISH IDIOT FOR BANNING BUMP STOCKS!!!!
2157 2018-02-20 21:41:25 Since that's not what bump stocks do, perhaps this is an entirely empty gesture.
2158 2018-02-20 21:41:24 FINALLY good news trump is banning bum stocks
2159 2018-02-20 21:41:22 Banning bump stocks is a red herring. There are videos on youtube that show you can use your belt loop, on your pants, as a bump stock. you just have to hold the gun at your side.
2160 2018-02-20 21:41:20 It’s not bump stocks that will make us love you, trumpy! It’s the ban of AR-15’s that will get you the love you keep to wander to find! @GOP @POTUS @CNNPolitics @FLOTUS @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @NancyPelosi
2161 2018-02-20 21:41:19 Talk is cheap.  What will he do with the bump stocks already in possession of gun owners??????
2162 2018-02-20 21:41:15 This should really habe more traction than Trumps "promise" to ban bump stocks. Especially given his history on promising to protecting people....women, LGBTQ etc.
2163 2018-02-20 21:41:13 I'm sure glad that the NRA and Donald Trump seem to have come to their senses and decided that "gun control" will amount to banning bump stocks. They've accounted for well, one, of our mass shootings and none of our schools shootings. But what the hell. Feeling safer already.
2164 2018-02-20 21:41:13 1. Assault rifles are legal.
2. Machine guns are defined to have an incredibly high fire rate, so bump stocks would still be legal.

Then again, he's not the best at words.
2165 2018-02-20 21:41:08 Banning bump stocks isn't an effective measure. Bump stocks can be made easily and cheaply at home. Just go to Youtube or Google the instructions.
2166 2018-02-20 21:41:06 Only problem with this plan, is "bump stocks" are a throw away, a piece of meat to feed the masses.  So we will feel like something is being done.  We must keep pushing for significant change to gun laws.  PS Most shameful thing today. Fla legislature refuses to consider limiting
2167 2018-02-20 21:41:02 20 states already had laws enacted or were preparing laws to enact bans on bump stocks. Tired of political games! Ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines again, NOW.
2168 2018-02-20 21:41:02 Also, bump stocks not used in Parkland. Vegas, true. And a memo  doesn’t mean anything will actually happen. Trump is trying to make it look like he’s doing something without really doing anything.
2169 2018-02-20 21:40:56 I hope there is much more action items coming out from this weapons meeting than just bump stocks. Bump stocks is not the answer. Hope and prayers and things like that is Not real progress.  Measuring this impact should be easy to see.
NOT ONE MORE LIFE!!
2170 2018-02-20 21:40:52 @gop @realDonaldTrump oh, now ur saying u will do something w bump stocks. U said that AFTER LV, the Church. Now u will do smthing abt mental illness? U did. You repealed Obama's law. U said this since every shooting since u took office. U lie ea day. Why believe you now?BULLSHIT
2171 2018-02-20 21:40:45 Bump stocks are symptoms  of US  “Dirty Harry” paranoid  militiaman mentality. Needed are cogent #gunlaws & to assist our young make healthy transitions into adulthood
2172 2018-02-20 21:40:41 BREAKING NEWS Trump takes executive action to ban bump stocks that turn rifles into automatic weapons.
#guncontrol #bumpstocks #PresidentTrump #GunControlNow
2173 2018-02-20 21:40:27 I bump stocks sono degli accessori, totalmente legali, che con 99 dollari permettono di modificare le armi semi-automatiche (che sono legali) in armi sempre semi-automatiche ma che hanno una capacità di sparare proiettili del tutto simile alle automatiche.
2174 2018-02-20 21:40:27 Trump urges ban on gun devices like bump stocks: WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he has…
2175 2018-02-20 21:40:26 2nd line of Pres. Trump memo on bump stocks:  "Although the Obama Administration repeatedly concluded that particular bump stock type devices were lawful to purchase and possess, I sought further clarification of the law restricting fully automatic machine guns."

2177 2018-02-20 21:40:25 Gee - not quite 5 months since the Vegas shooting that actual employed bump stocks - but better late than never, I guess...
2178 2018-02-20 21:40:25 So your latest ploy to regulate bump stocks is a good one - nice try sending off a test flare with the NRA. Maybe after the next mass shooting you will want to regulate assault weapons.

#TrumpColluded
@realDonaldTrump
2179 2018-02-20 21:40:24 Weren’t bump stocks like two or three mass shootings ago?
2180 2018-02-20 21:40:22 Liberals crying about gun control. Trump directs to have bump stocks banned....don’t see anyone talking about that....
2181 2018-02-20 21:40:17 Bump stocks had nothing to do with the slaughter of students in Parkland.  This is a shiny object distraction from the real issues, cynically done to provide political cover for this White House and the NRA.  #GunReformNow
2182 2018-02-20 21:40:17 Trump memo on bump stocks says "Although the Obama Administration repeatedly concluded that particular bump stock type devices were lawful to purchase and possess, I sought further clarification of the law restricting fully automatic machineguns."
2183 2018-02-20 21:40:13 just bump stocks?
2184 2018-02-20 21:40:09 Trump just announced a push to ban "bump stocks" after last week's deadly shooting, a move that officials said would likely require Congress to act. -- HuffPost
2185 2018-02-20 21:40:01 Trump did something good today. He signed a ban on bump stocks. Got to give him props. At least someone did something. More than I can say for congress.
2186 2018-02-20 21:39:45 Pour des petits stocks plutôt mais je pense que chez graphigro il y a le type de rangement adéquat c'est le repère des étudiants archi
2187 2018-02-20 21:39:39 Timeline; a year ago he reversed a mental health provision that would have possibly prevented #Parkland and 4 months after Vegas, he does something that wouldn’t have helped #Parkland by banning bump stocks? #BanAssaultWeapons
2188 2018-02-20 21:39:38 Announcing the possibility of trying to push for a ban on bump stocks does not make it “one down”. It has to get through Congress and become law before you can say that.
2189 2018-02-20 21:39:38 NASA cancels SLS contract!

In other news, Defense related stocks tumble...
2190 2018-02-20 21:39:37 There is no legitimate reason to have them. They are not for target practice . I believe all qualified people should pack heat but there is really no reason for bump stocks
2191 2018-02-20 21:39:36 Because it’s the only issue that the NRA agreed with!  Bump stocks?  BFD.  Do something a little more and I’ll believe he gives a shit
2192 2018-02-20 21:39:34 I thought the bump stocks were already illegal in most states.
2193 2018-02-20 21:39:30 Watch what happens next ... he just said he could support gun legislation that outlawed bump stocks, etc.   That support will NEXT be tied to getting these "short term plans" allowed.
2194 2018-02-20 21:39:28 DOJ statement on bump stocks: "The Department understands this is a priority for the President and has acted quickly to move through the rulemaking process. We look forward to the results of that process as soon as it is duly completed."
2195 2018-02-20 21:39:24 You're saying an inexperienced shooter, trying to murder as many people as he could, while firing from hundreds of yards away, would have killed more people without these bump stocks because he would have placed his shots more accurately? 

"Headshots only. I ain't no pussy."
2196 2018-02-20 21:39:22 BUMP STOCKS ARE GETTING BANNED!!! keep the pressure on! #GunControlNow #BlueWave2018 #StayStrong #Resistance #NRABloodMoney
2197 2018-02-20 21:39:18 I don’t often criticize DJT, but this absolutely lame. I really don’t think the vast majority of firearms owners give a good flying flip about “bump stocks”. Only the idiots without any knowledge who think this is an answer.
2198 2018-02-20 21:39:17 But say bye-bye t yo those bump-stocks
2199 2018-02-20 21:39:17 There's a bill to ban bump stocks and trigger cranks in Congress. 
Trump hasn't said - yet - that he wants it on his desk.
2200 2018-02-20 21:39:08 Part of the problem, is WE dont use the "right" gun lingo.
Automatic means pull the trigger once and it keeps shooting. The AR-15 is a semi-auto. It can be modified after it is bought to shoot faster. The Las Vegas shooter used bump stocks.
Prices start at about 500 up to 2500.
2201 2018-02-20 21:39:07 When deadly bump stocks are finally banned, we’ll only have like 99.5% more progress to make.
2202 2018-02-20 21:39:07 FL gun proposal banning bump stocks that can allow semi-automatic guns to spray bullets quickly and creating gun-violence restraining orders
2203 2018-02-20 21:38:59 So, no semi auto purchases for people under 21, wasn’t common sense?

Anyone wanting a semi auto needs to register, wasnt common sense 

Gun show loopholes closed (they exist, come to Vegas, they’re here too) wasn’t common sense?

No bump stocks, wasn’t common sense?
2204 2018-02-20 21:38:54 What does bump stocks have to do with #ParklandSchoolShooting ?
2205 2018-02-20 21:38:45 #RT @AP: BREAKING: President Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks used in Las Vegas massacre.
2206 2018-02-20 21:38:38 Stop giving rights away without getting anything in return! Bump stock . Why couldn’t we lower the amount of dollars going to Planned Parenthood if you’re going to ban bump stocks? Art of the deal?
2207 2018-02-20 21:38:30 Wasn't Hussain responsible for pushing thru approve on Bump Stocks? Good thing Trump is looking at making them illegal.
2208 2018-02-20 21:38:28 True but today he just signed a rule to ban bump stocks and supported a bill to increase the background checks. I’m expecting more actually
2209 2018-02-20 21:38:26 Ackt'ually it's not bad to give a few small crumbs to them, at present, imoh, if they'll just STFU, (I know, not a chance). Bump-stocks SUCK for accuracy, waste valuable ammo, and jam your weapon 7 times out of 10.  But that's just my .02, worth what was paid for it.

2211 2018-02-20 21:38:05 Please don’t be distracted by this carrot today offering to ban bump stocks. Give me a break, we’re not that stupid. It’s a ruse and he knows it won’t pass. He wants to take the heat off of the town hall tomorrow night by throwing you all a bone. STAY THE COURSE
2212 2018-02-20 21:38:03 Trump tells Sessions to ban bump stocks. For those asking for real change this is known as getting "Jeff Concessioned"...
2213 2018-02-20 21:38:01 We already had legislation around bump stocks drafted....it went nowhere. For someone who loves to blame previous administrations for failing to act, here is an example of him failing to act!
2214 2018-02-20 21:37:58 Right now, regulating bump stocks is a start. JUST a start.
2215 2018-02-20 21:37:52 His base will rebel on DACA and peel off for the bump stocks and because of his behavior won't get support from the other side. Had he pivoted early on then he might have had chance. ie Made Hilllary an ambassador and told his base he finally got the Clintons out of the country.
2216 2018-02-20 21:37:50 Signing a memo doesn’t mean shit. It’s been almost 5 months since Vegas shooting. That should have been done the first week after the massacre. I for one am not giving him credit until a law is passed banning bump stocks.
2217 2018-02-20 21:37:47 It is a great thing to ban Bump Stocks, however it’s a bait and switch by NRA to shutdown the conversation. Even the NRA doesn’t support Bump Stocks. Cruz didn’t have a Bump Stock! @ChrisMurphyCT @NicolleDWallace @maddow @JoyAnnReid @Lawrence
2218 2018-02-20 21:37:45 many are dropping their membership of the NRA- some because they do not want gun ownership to be attached to protecting mass murder and others because the NRA pushed for banning bump stocks, which Trump is pushing Sessions to do. buh bye NRA
2219 2018-02-20 21:37:41 I swear I thought the DEA was ordered to review bump stocks after the Las Vegas shooting, am I wrong?
2220 2018-02-20 21:37:38 I don’t know, but how many people have been killed by bump stocks that weren’t attached to GUNS. @realDonaldTrump is a real piece of horse doo doo. And if he thinks this will quell the outcry for gun control, you and your cronies @NRA need to dig deeper.
2221 2018-02-20 21:37:35 And Trump just signed a memo asking Sessions to ban bump stocks... coincidence? I think not! These young adults will take back our Country! VOTE... please! YOU are making a difference! 
2222 2018-02-20 21:37:33 But! But! But!  I thought criminals don't follow the law?  And won't people who really want bump stocks find a way to get them anyways?
2223 2018-02-20 21:37:31 Those like the Las Vegas killer did. Sales of bump stocks soared after LV. Who bought them & why did they need them?
2224 2018-02-20 21:37:31 That said, banning bump stocks was the biggest no-brainer. It should have been done immediately after Las Vegas.
2225 2018-02-20 21:37:31 If Trump bans bump stocks it will be his first accomplishment. That said, the Parkland shooter didn't use a bump stock. This is not enough.
2226 2018-02-20 21:37:30 Trump supporters before today: “Don’t ban bump stocks”
Trump supporters today: “We support sensible solutions like this”
2227 2018-02-20 21:37:28 Anyone with a a basic machine can manufacture bump stocks. Which makes banning them a giant virtue signal.
2228 2018-02-20 21:37:26 So he banned bump stocks?
2229 2018-02-20 21:37:25 He may well get bump stocks banned, and then he'll claim he has done more to protect the country from gun violence than all of the previous U.S. Presidents combined.
2230 2018-02-20 21:37:21 I'm sorry but bump stocks are an accessory for the AR-15. It was used in Vegas. They couldn't even get a vote for a ban on the House floor. It wouldn't have had any impact on FL.

Get rid of AR-15 & similar. Give our kids a fighting chance & keep war weapons in war zones.
2231 2018-02-20 21:37:15 Trump confirmed he has directed AG Sessions to propose a “ban all devices” like bump stocks.
There is NO denying this LEFT turn.
2232 2018-02-20 21:37:15 He will be touting this big time. No time for taking action on Russia, I’m bringing down bump stocks. While that is a worthwhile move, we will hear about it ad nauseum, at the expense of stopping Russian interference, which he does not want to act on.
2233 2018-02-20 21:37:14 Huge difference between having regulations and banning. Meaning ...bump stocks will still be open for sales.
2234 2018-02-20 21:37:14 Cosa sono i bump stocks?
2235 2018-02-20 21:37:14 Trump is attempting to ban bump stocks (a device that turns semiautomatic weapons into automatic weapons). This is a huge step on the path to achieve proper gun control! It’s also a pleasant surprise that this is coming from a conservative politician.
2236 2018-02-20 21:37:12 Remember when he sold all of the stocks in his kid's education fund because he thought Trump would tank the economy. He's just not good at doing things.
2237 2018-02-20 21:37:11 Justice Department statement on bump stocks:

"The Department understands this is a priority for the President and has acted quickly to move through the rulemaking process. We look forward to the results of that process as soon as it is duly completed."
2238 2018-02-20 21:37:06 oh Joe, you are a turncoat--if they ban BUMP STOCKS, regulate AR-15, raise the age from 18 to 21, have like a no-fly list-for people who have a mental illness, -you still be sitting there with your other half and label law abiding gun owners as killers
2239 2018-02-20 21:37:06 OMG.  It's a starting place.  Don't tell me you think bump stocks are the hill the GOP should die on?  Jeez.  They need to show they at least give a damn.
2240 2018-02-20 21:37:03 Simple. ATF writes letter in reverse of the letter approving bump stocks. Done. No new laws necessary.
2241 2018-02-20 21:37:01 If he's referring to bump stocks, anyone with a fair knowledge of mechanics can make one with two screws, two washers, a couple of springs, and a long T shaped piece of flat metal.
2242 2018-02-20 21:37:00 Donald Trump is pushing for a ban on Bump Stocks for AR-15s. I anticipate the Democrats will be coming out shortly in favor of Bump Stocks.
2243 2018-02-20 21:36:59 He could address this in an Executive Order banning bump stocks.  not pass the buck to Pee-Wee Sessions and hope that we forget it in the face of more scandals.
2244 2018-02-20 21:36:59 Do NOT thank @realDonaldTrump for directing AG to regulate bump stocks.  This is tiny, and it's a distraction.  He's slashed school safety funding, mental health, etc.  Demand reinstating the assault weapons ban, bg checks, and research on gun violence.  This is lip service!
2245 2018-02-20 21:36:57 “Dear congresswoman Titus,

Big ed doesn’t give a shit about bump stocks 

Thanks”
2246 2018-02-20 21:36:56 many are dropping their membership of the NRA- some because they do not want gun ownership to be attached to mass murder and others because the NRA pushed for banning bump stocks, which Trump is pushing Sessions to do. buh bye NRA
2247 2018-02-20 21:36:54 @AliVelshi just bump stocks.....
2248 2018-02-20 21:36:52 Trump is a complete moron to make any concessions to these people. Talking about bump stocks or anything else. Then again the idiot just endorsed Romney. #NRA #2A #TuesdayThoughts
2249 2018-02-20 21:36:51 Referring to bump stocks as 'accessories' seems to understate the added devastation these killing devices add to weapons. SHS's pearls are accessories. I'm with you, I don't trust Trump with this gesture.
2250 2018-02-20 21:36:47 Bump stocks decrease accuracy and are exclusively used by assholes with small dicks and large ammo budgets.  A ban is a good thing
2251 2018-02-20 21:36:43 Is someone shorting Britain?  A hard Brexit cannot work. These people are not that stupid surely. The pound or stocks would surely be hit. I am no financier but you need a disaster for disaster capitalism- eg post soviet russia.
2252 2018-02-20 21:36:43 Ban the f***ing automatic weapons, not bump stocks!
2253 2018-02-20 21:36:43 The only way to end gun violence is to ban bump stocks. Thank You @realDonaldTrump for eliminating so many preventable deaths. #MAGA #NRA
2254 2018-02-20 21:36:41 Yes indeed. Altho the NRA has no qualms about outlawing bump stocks, it is one step forward. But we need more.
2255 2018-02-20 21:36:37 "Bump Stocks"... This will save countless lives in the streets of Chicago. Last, wait no one was killed in Chi-town with a Bump stock. Trump fell for the "Feel Good"...
2256 2018-02-20 21:36:32 Just remember when the NRA was using bump stocks as a “shiny object” to distract from talking about meaningful action on gun violence—Trump is likely doing the same.
2257 2018-02-20 21:36:30 maybe i'm jaded--or maybe i'm jaded because I pay attention--he didn't want to do anything w/bump stocks until demand to outlaw assault weapons began&kids started marching w/so much support nationwide now he is using distraction choosing lesser instead of doing the right thing
2258 2018-02-20 21:36:22 Can’t believe they didn’t outlaw bump stocks after the Vegas shooting smh
2259 2018-02-20 21:36:19 @realDonaldTrump U gave away a negotiable (bump stocks) without getting anything in return.  Now you support AR bans & waiting periods.  Won’t vote for you again.  I got my conservative SCOTUS - you are now a one term president to me......
2260 2018-02-20 21:36:14 I don’t think that’s what was said, didn’t he say he signed another piece of paper so Sessions can possibly  discuss it now. He’s the president, if he can just sign a piece of paper and ban people from flying, kick people out for living, he can easily sign a ban on bump stocks.
2261 2018-02-20 21:36:12 Bump stocks mimics  a automatic weapon doesn’t make one a fully automatic weapon.
2262 2018-02-20 21:36:12 * Trump beordrer forbud mot «bump stock»  Dagbladet * Trump vil forby såkalte «bump stocks»  NRK
2263 2018-02-20 21:36:00 Nothing about AR15, how convenient.
Just ban the bump stocks, that shouldn’t have passed, in the first place.
2264 2018-02-20 21:35:57 NRA always used bump stocks as a "bargaining' chip. They could care less about bump stocks as long as Congress doesn't regulate them.
2265 2018-02-20 21:35:55 #Editorial: I guess we'll have to wait and see what exactly the DOJ recommends in regards to bump stocks and other modifications, but I can't ignore the timing of this action in the context of the media's anti-gun firestorm. It's never good to show weakness to a Leftist mob. #2A
2266 2018-02-20 21:35:47 I saw that. I don't really have a problem with removing bump-stocks. There is a shooting technique that can be used that mimics the effect of a bump-stock, so you really don't need one. It is for lazy shooters.
2267 2018-02-20 21:35:44 2/2: And in regards to crypto, do u still think Wall Street didn't enter the crypto? Did stocks give power to the people? C'mon, do you think Buffet, Rotschilds, etc. will give up their fortune and influence just like that? This is the utopian mindset Millennials are sharing.
2268 2018-02-20 21:35:43 What America really loves is blood and gore, because why else would be be putting tiny little bandaids on GAPING BULLET WOUNDS? 

It needs to be sweeping, dramatic, strict, and swift. You think banning bump stocks will make mass shootings stop? TRY. HARDER.
2269 2018-02-20 21:35:40 Hope these bump stocks become illegal.
2270 2018-02-20 21:35:40 And Jack, you lied on TV. You said the Concealed Carry bill addresses bump stocks, which is only true if by addressing it you mean $100k for a report. Which is crap.
2271 2018-02-20 21:35:38 It's a Trump story cause he is a paid-for politician by the NRA. That's why it's a Trump story. Vegas happened 150 days ago ... he TODAY told his AG to do something about Bump Stocks. That's why its a Trump story
2272 2018-02-20 21:35:35 Yes, he can ban the sale of the bump stocks, but they can be made with the use of a 3D printer & there's enough guidance on the internet on how to just do that.
2273 2018-02-20 21:35:32 Trump approved moving ahead with action on “bump stocks” because he thought it had something to do with the market going up
2274 2018-02-20 21:35:31 Breaking: President Trump signs bill to take steps to ban Bump Stocks which were used in Las Vegas Massacre. What will haters and losers say now...
2275 2018-02-20 21:35:26 No, I am not worried about stocks or bonds.

I am worried about the banks collapsing, capital controls & the devaluation of all currencies. 

I understand one needs to buy precious metals. 
I am concerned where to put savings.
Real estate in France is just too difficult.
2276 2018-02-20 21:35:25 #Trump say he directed Atty General Jeff #Sessions 2 propose changes that would ban so-called "bump stocks," which make it easier to fire rounds quicker. #guncontrol #GunReformNow
2277 2018-02-20 21:35:22 President Trump you should have banned bump stocks at a earlier time.
2278 2018-02-20 21:35:19 instead he has basically gone the unpopular direction at every damn turn, so I'm surprised that I am pleasantly surprised that he did this with bump stocks
2279 2018-02-20 21:35:17 President Trump should not take action against bump stocks or firearms.
2280 2018-02-20 21:35:11 He'll get some backlash from Limbaugh, Hannity and LaPierre, and will allow the bump stocks again.  Lacks the guts to go against the right-wing fringe.
2281 2018-02-20 21:35:09 In a statement, Ministry says previous govt also notified stakeholders, and proposed regulatory changes not considered market-moving. As for Kinder Morgan stocks, says ongoing correction in energy stocks driven by US shale production. #bcpoli
2282 2018-02-20 21:34:59 1) trump doesn’t know what bump stocks are
2) tomorrow there will be bamp stocks that aren’t banned
2283 2018-02-20 21:34:56 It was a safe gesture to make since there isn't much support for bump stocks as a vital expression of civil rights. I suspect most who've bought them used them once or twice for fun and then left them in a drawer because the ammo cost adds up really fast.
2284 2018-02-20 21:34:54 Ok ban the bump stocks. Not good for accuracy anyway. Real decision is how and when we will fence in, gate guard and arm door guards at every high school, middle and elementary.
2285 2018-02-20 21:34:49 good point, although i’m not sure how the gun lobby will take this, even though i think the NRA is kinda against bump stocks anyway so maybe it won’t affect anything
2286 2018-02-20 21:34:46 Surge in sales of bump stocks.
2287 2018-02-20 21:34:41 NO HE DIDN'T! He proposed it after the Vegas massacre. Then nothing. Only AFTER the tragedy in Florida did he punt the ban of bump stocks on to Sessions, YESTERDAY he signed a piece of paper telling Sessions to PROPOSE it again!

2290 2018-02-20 21:34:38 White House pool report just now: President Trump announced he just signed a directive ordering Attorney General Jeff Sessions to craft regulations banning “bump stocks” and other devices that turn semi-automatic firearms into automatic weapons. (more)
2291 2018-02-20 21:34:36 Oh look. Bump stocks today. Hand guns tomorrow. Lol.
2292 2018-02-20 21:34:31 Why didn't your President Oblama ban bump stocks?  In fact, he ok'd them!!!
2293 2018-02-20 21:34:30 there will not be any action taken on guns, either thru bump stocks or back ground checks

congress & the POTUS, like they always do, will leave the dance with those who brought them: the NRA

the next shooting will lead to more thoughts & prayers & we will repeat the cycle
2294 2018-02-20 21:34:27 @Emma4Change , Trump trying to talk around issue by making general statements about bump-stocks, today. Seems to be kicking the can down the road, again. BS #GunReformNow #StonemanDouglasHS
2295 2018-02-20 21:34:23 #DEVELOPING: President Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks used in Las Vegas massacre
2296 2018-02-20 21:34:22 Problem is, bump stocks do not turn guns into machine guns. By legal definition, a machine gun is a gun that fires more than 1 shot with 1 trigger pull. A bump stock allows the trigger to be pulled faster. I don't trust anything Trump says. Must be verified.

2298 2018-02-20 21:34:18 LV shooter killed somewhere around 60 people .. could have done easily w/o bump stocks n with improvement in accuracy w/o .. kills could have been worse .. I see bump fire stocks as a non issue that will fix nothing .. only makes uninformed feel good
2299 2018-02-20 21:34:17 I heard memorandum to look into banning bump stocks not actual ban.
2300 2018-02-20 21:34:12 Remember it took student activism to put an end to the Viet Nam war now it's your generations turn to change the rediculous gun laws in this country. Trump has just instructed Sessions to draft legislation to end bump stocks. Student power, it's working. Keep going!!!!!!!
2301 2018-02-20 21:34:11 Making the point Obama tried other things but was blocked. Bump stocks didn't come into play until 2017 I believe. I could be wrong though. Good thing about a majority party, things can get done. Don't care which party it is.
2302 2018-02-20 21:34:07 But, bump stocks were not used in that event.  Paddock didn't shoot anyone.  Fire came from belt fed machine guns e.g. M249 light machine guns.  This nonsense is getting increasingly annoying.  Someone in the media, please tell the truth.
2303 2018-02-20 21:34:04 Trump now wants to ban bump stocks. Bump stocks don't kill people. AR-15s kill people. Anything to divert attention away from the real questions.
2304 2018-02-20 21:34:02 Don't worry you will still be able to pump stocks to people as long as you are not aiming at them an AR-15 with a bump stock attached while doing the pump.
2305 2018-02-20 21:33:57 Petty, remember USA. NRA already agreed to regulate bum stocks. Nothing for something. It's not good enough! This is not Russia or Turkey, but trumpism is "Real" He is insane, why am I wrong? Or not?
2306 2018-02-20 21:33:55 Ideas for US law reform:
1. Ban all rapid-fire & semi-automatic guns, including guns that can be modified to fire faster (& modifiers e.g. bump stocks)
2. Hold buy back & amnesty to get these out of the community
3. Strengthen all gun background checks, waits etc.

2309 2018-02-20 21:33:50 Trump’s gonna ask Jeffy to ban bump stocks, Jeffy will fail at the task, Trump will then renew his attacks on Jeffy and claim that he tried to ban bump stocks but Jeffy sucks.
2310 2018-02-20 21:33:50 has trump explained what bump stocks have to do with the parkland shooting i assume no
2311 2018-02-20 21:33:47 Banning bump stocks is an empty gesture, if it even passes.
2312 2018-02-20 21:33:45 takes no courage to only support a ban on bump stocks. It's literally the LEAST he could do without offending NRA. I award him no credit
2313 2018-02-20 21:33:43 @sarahchad_ looks like you kids have had your first (of many) wins! Trump recommending banning bump stocks. Keep the pressure on! Much more to do!!
2314 2018-02-20 21:33:43 The executive directed a review by DOJ and ATV back in November. The review concerned regs to ban bump stocks , Review was nearly complete and due to events of #Parkland, the results expedited.
2315 2018-02-20 21:33:43 and I'm not sure what your tying the 10 months prior to vegas to.  Until vegas bump stocks were another item the left had no idea they hated.
2316 2018-02-20 21:33:41 Trump doesn't want to ban bump stocks. Let's see him get behind that bill and push it to his desk.
2317 2018-02-20 21:33:37 So the NRA has allowed him to ban bump stocks. Which they already said they were good with. Trump seemed drugged. Did they sedate him? He sounded like when Jimmy Kimmel slows him down. I thought he was having a stroke. #TrumpColluded
2318 2018-02-20 21:33:34 Sales of bump stocks just went through the roof?

2321 2018-02-20 21:33:30 Without a switched conversion to full auto, AR-15s remain just another a rifle.  Also, bump stocks are bad? You can do same thing with some duck-tape and a stick!  Laws don't stop bad guys. Gun free zones are 'kill zones'.
2322 2018-02-20 21:33:22 Banning bump stocks is an important first step. That is NOT common sense gun legislation. Both important, but very different, issues.
2323 2018-02-20 21:33:21 I suggest you rethink that right now. Bump stocks are to blame for Las Vegas. Precisely, a bumpstock was used on an AR-15 in Las Vegas. How can you honestly say that this won’t make any difference?
2324 2018-02-20 21:33:16 .@RealDonad_Trump is asking the @TheJusticeDept to propose regulations to ban bump stocks, which can turn legal weapons into illegal ones.
2325 2018-02-20 21:33:16 I was raised on wild meat and if it wasn't for hunting we would of starved- Shotguns for birds, rifles for deer and elk..... different guns for different animals- HAND GUNS, ASSAULT GUNS, BUMP STOCKS ARE MEANT TO KILL THE HUMAN SPECIES- #NoNRAMoney #ShameOnYou 1/2
2326 2018-02-20 21:33:09 Bump stocks played a role in Las Vegas massacre. GOP/NRA doesn't want bump stocks banned, even though only purpose is to mimic full auto mode for a gun whose only purpose is mass murder when in hands of a civilian.
2327 2018-02-20 21:33:07 No, not enough as bump stocks along with silencers can easily be made with the use of 3D printers

2330 2018-02-20 21:32:57 ATF and DOJ have said in the past, even under Obama, that they did not have the authority to regulate Bump Stocks. The point of this is to get positive headlines, and sadly the media is dumb enough to blindly follow along. Only the congress can regulate this.
2331 2018-02-20 21:32:57 Dude probably thinks bump stocks are why the Dow dropped 1200 points
2332 2018-02-20 21:32:51 Bet he'll direct his children to buy stock in bump stocks sales will go thru the roof before a law banning them goes into effect
2333 2018-02-20 21:32:51 He should have banned bump stocks and ALL automatic weapons last year!
2334 2018-02-20 21:32:50 Bump stocks had nothing to do with Florida. They are however a huge delayed response to Las Vegas. Also Jeff Sessions? This would not be LAW. Only a suggestion.  Just another distraction from the WH to avoid doing something
2335 2018-02-20 21:32:48 News Alert: Trump directs attorney general to create regulations to ban 'bump stocks'
2336 2018-02-20 21:32:46 So, in other words, bump stocks will remain legal, as they do not turn semi-automatic firearms into machine guns.
2337 2018-02-20 21:32:40 It's a head-fake. ATF was already ordered to propose that regardless: they said they lack authority under their enabling statutes because gun stocks aren't weapons, that Congress must enact any restrictions. WH & AG know this already.
2338 2018-02-20 21:32:38 So why didn't he direct the Justice Department to ban bump stocks after Vegas?  Did he need two more mass killings to think enough was enough? The issue is the NRA and our politician's pockets being lined with their money.  This doesn't happen in Canada, Australia, etc.
2339 2018-02-20 21:32:35 "propose regulations to ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns"

Leaving aside the fact we already have those regs and the wiggle room in the word "propose", if their intent is to move bump stocks to the NFA like a DIAS, aside from hurting the stock maker, meh.
2340 2018-02-20 21:32:35 No he didn't he used words very carefully, fully automatic weapons already illegal and bump stocks already proven to be legal as they don't modify the actual firing mechanism. It's a diversion to be seen to be doing something when doing nothing
2341 2018-02-20 21:32:31 What are bunk stocks
2342 2018-02-20 21:32:29 Hey I see today that @POTUS seems to be under the same impression I was: “President Trump announces move to ban bump stocks that convert semi-automatic guns into machine guns.” -@piersmorgan
2343 2018-02-20 21:32:22 He probably thinks that this will give stocks a bump. No idea what he is doing but sometimes you’ve got to take what you’re given. Several months late but better than nothing
2344 2018-02-20 21:32:21 @TeamCavuto Neil, tell me how banning bump stocks would save lives.
2345 2018-02-20 21:32:19 @realDonaldTrump Why not just do an Executive Order of you’re serious?
@votevets @vets @VetsAgnstTrump @13WJM @MomsDemand #NeverAgain  It can happen today!!!  Before everyone stocks up.  Also call for a buyback program!
2346 2018-02-20 21:32:19 @realDonaldTrump If you're going "pen and phone" on bump stocks and screwing over gun owners, we won't have your back any longer. How about you at least get us suppressor in exchange for bump stocks Mr. Art of the Deal.
2347 2018-02-20 21:32:09 Trump bans bump stocks. Liberals will be pro-bump stocks now. Because we know they can’t ever agree with Trump. #GunControlNow @realDonaldTrump #LiberalLunacy
2348 2018-02-20 21:32:08 So where’s the memo? The grit is in the details & a few months ago his own DoJ basically kicked this to ATF, which is an agency stripped of jurisdiction over bump stocks. Same old Donny 2 Chins...hyperbole without the details.
2349 2018-02-20 21:32:08 Ban bump stocks. Let's see him back the bill on that single issue. Hold him accountable and hold him to it.

He wont last five minutes and will lose focus.
2350 2018-02-20 21:32:07 I don’t give a fuck that @realDonaldTrump just “banned” bump stocks.

As we all know he could turn around tomorrow and make them legal again.
That’s what happens when you have a con man play the part of “president.”
2351 2018-02-20 21:32:03 Should bump stocks be available to law-abiding citizens? I mean, I'm not aware of many fully automatic weapons being used prolifically in crimes.
2352 2018-02-20 21:32:00 Before Vegas few people, including gun owners, heard of bump stocks. Now Trump is using them as a cover to appease the masses until another tragedy.
2353 2018-02-20 21:32:00 Yea we are way passed bump stocks and his half assed attempt to save face by banning them now will score him no brownie points
2354 2018-02-20 21:31:59 For gods sake don't do the bump stocks thing. They'll never stop. Don't ever apologize to these people. They'll take a mile when you give an inch
2355 2018-02-20 21:31:56 Baby Steps: Trump has directed the DOJ to propose regulations re bump stocks.  This is such a minor step, with a long way to go. Don't let him turn this into action on #guncontrol  We need real #GunReformNow
2356 2018-02-20 21:31:52 If you don’t care about bump stocks, then there’s no issue at hand.
2357 2018-02-20 21:31:51 Trump has just now, today, decided to move to ban bump stocks.  doesn’t it feel like he was holding this in his back pocket so he could use it after another inevitable shooting?

a slam dunk move could’ve easily been done months ago.

small start, but more’s needed. #GunReformNow
2358 2018-02-20 21:31:50 Why haven’t you reported Trump writing a memo to recommend the banning of bump stocks?
2359 2018-02-20 21:31:47 Bump stocks are the sacrificial lamb, just an appeasement they’ve been keeping in their back pocket so they can “lose one” in the hopes we’ll take the small victory and forget about the real needs here.

2360 2018-02-20 21:31:46 Such a small yet possibly meaningful move...  Trump moves to ban 'bump stocks'.
2361 2018-02-20 21:31:45 bump stock make weapons fire less accurately .n. over heats the rifle .. fire is determined by magazine size .. if you can shoot 30 round magazine in 30 seconds and reload ..  or in 2 seconds spraying and have to reload .. same or worse could have been done w/o bump fire stocks
2362 2018-02-20 21:31:41 He won't even enforce the sanctions on Russia so not really hopeful here that his belated (benighted?) statements on bump stocks will translate into action.
2363 2018-02-20 21:31:39 rilly. What about the rest of his bums and stocks
2364 2018-02-20 21:31:38 Bye Bump stocks!      Trump to AG:          “GET RID OF THEM!”
2365 2018-02-20 21:31:36 we will ban ARs like we did from 94-04....today's news on Bump Stocks shocks me..and guns got nothing to do with our greatness....not one damn thing...
2366 2018-02-20 21:31:36 Sessions is head of the DOJ. The DOJ is head of the ATF. The ATF is who determines the legality of bump stocks. So if the ATF reclassifies bump stocks as illegal, it's done. No need to go through Congress. Question is why previous administrations didn't do this before.
2367 2018-02-20 21:31:34 Msn announced the the President has ordered the ban on bump stocks. I am ok with that
2368 2018-02-20 21:31:32 @realDonaldTrump announces plan to ban bump stocks that convert semi-automatic guns into machine guns. Good signs at last. #GunControlNow #GunReformNow #guncontrol #GunSenseNow #gunsense

2370 2018-02-20 21:31:23 Banning bump stocks is a first step, but only that. We will not be satisfied if this is all that is done.
2371 2018-02-20 21:31:22 The fed assault weapons ban of 1994 had it pretty clear: semi automatic capable of detachable magazines, folding stocks, pistol grips, bayonet lugs, threaded barrels grenade launchers
2372 2018-02-20 21:31:18 The NRA doesn't support bump stocks.
2373 2018-02-20 21:31:18 Uhm... no law against bump stocks
2374 2018-02-20 21:31:18 Still holding $THDS?
2375 2018-02-20 21:31:17 Curious about reports Trump is going to ban bump stocks.... because he said he was going to “propose regulations” (a proposal isn’t necessarily going to pass) and on “all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns” - of which there are in actuality zero
2376 2018-02-20 21:31:10 Arming teachers??? We just saw a teacher body slam a student. And you want them to have guns? Problem not solved. They need bump stocks also dumb ass!!!! for brains.
2377 2018-02-20 21:31:09 As people sell more than they buy stocks go down, which creates uncertainty in the markets which lead to banks not lending out as much money and that in turn can to poorer living standards. Its not that prices go up its your dollar being worth less.
2378 2018-02-20 21:31:07 @Lblegend33 $aimt down after hours on secondary. Smart to sell on spike than being a bagholder sometimes though how a stock performs after data is mind boggling. Certain stocks goes up on crl and negative data lol
2379 2018-02-20 21:31:07 @realDonaldTrump thank you President Trump, taking action on bump stocks is a major step in the right direction. I applaud you sir.
2380 2018-02-20 21:31:03 In all likelihood such a ban would be thrown out by the courts based on current legal opinions on the issue.   Congress needs to pass a law banning bump stocks.   Laws on the books don't give the ATF the ability to ban them on their own.
2381 2018-02-20 21:31:03 I wonder how many gun enthusiasts have purchased assault weapons and bump stocks in the days since the FL massacre?  Dear Leader doesn’t care. He could’ve declared a ban after Vegas.
2382 2018-02-20 21:31:03 ATF and DOJ have said in the past, even under Obama, that they did not have the authority to regulate Bump Stocks. The point of this is to get positive headlines, and sadly the media is dumb enough to blindly follow along.
2383 2018-02-20 21:30:58 This is so everyone calms down about the shootings. Can still do tons of damage without bump stocks
2384 2018-02-20 21:30:51 BREAKING: President Trump on bump stocks: "Just a few moments ago, I signed a memorandum directing the Attorney General to propose regulations to ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns."

2385 2018-02-20 21:30:43 People who are in favor of automatic weapons via bump stocks: But what if I'm attacked by an infantry regiment of ISIS or you know, deer?
2386 2018-02-20 21:30:43 You're just reinforcing my point; talking about a ban on something that "turns a legal gun into a machine gun" necessarily excludes bump stocks.
2387 2018-02-20 21:30:40 He didn't sign a law. He signed a memo going to the ATF, directions them to draft a rule that makes bump stocks illegal, so at least two years until it becomes law. If they were going full bore... So really, he did nothing.
2388 2018-02-20 21:30:38 buh bye bump stocks...
2389 2018-02-20 21:30:37 President Trump has signed a memorandum directing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to craft regulations to ban “bump stocks” and other devices that turn semi-automatic firearms into automatic weapons.
2390 2018-02-20 21:30:36 this kid in Florida legally bought like 7 rifles in a month leading up the shooting, the absolute least we can do is ban bump stocks.
2391 2018-02-20 21:30:31 We're going to ban bumb stocks. Not sure if he's ignoring... Sigh
2392 2018-02-20 21:30:27 RT AaronBlake: BREAKING: Trump says he signed memorandum directing Sessions to propose regulations on banning bump stocks
2393 2018-02-20 21:30:25 Am I imagining this or didn’t the repugnicans block the ban on bump stocks after Sandy Hook?
2394 2018-02-20 21:30:24 Well hey! At least both countries no longer allow bump stocks!!

Yea Gun Control!!!

Those kids are really bringing the pressure. Good for them!!
2395 2018-02-20 21:30:18 Is this why the Republicans stalled on @SenFeinstein's legislation to ban bump stocks back in November, holding this in reserve to "answer" the next mass shooting?
2396 2018-02-20 21:30:16 bump stocks more like bum socks hahahahaha thats a funny word for underwear
2397 2018-02-20 21:30:13 President's directive to Justice Dept. to ban "bump stocks" and other devices that turn legal guns into automatic weapons may inspire NRA opponents to push for even more. Trump told AG Sessions he wants these new guidelines "very soon"
2398 2018-02-20 21:30:05 .@POTUS orders DOJ to Ban "bump" stocks used in Vegas Shooting.  @fox5dc
2399 2018-02-20 21:30:04 Well at last Trump is playing catch up! Bet they sales of bump stocks rocket now till the ban us bought in. His NRA chums get a bit of leeway!! It's wrong!!! @realDonaldTrump
2400 2018-02-20 21:30:03 So the study on bump stocks he asked the DOJ for after Las Vegas was never done? Does your network know how to google?
2401 2018-02-20 21:30:03 Some stocks that I'm continuing to avoid. $RH $EXAS $HMNY $HIMX $RIOT $KNDI $AMD $INCY $RAD $FB
2402 2018-02-20 21:30:02 Trump pushes for ban on gun 'bump stocks'. France surrenders.
2403 2018-02-20 21:30:02 Wish a nigga would swing that’s headshot Jordan’s on cost 450 an they dead stocks 
2404 2018-02-20 21:29:59 Too bad bump stocks had nothing to do with this shooting it was just in Vegas!
2405 2018-02-20 21:29:58 I give a shit about bump stocks

Families of the 58 who died #1October chive a shit

Families of the hundreds injured #1October give a shit

Southern Nevada gives a shit

Just because you dont Or you don’t know anyone who does, doesn’t mean it’s important.
2406 2018-02-20 21:29:57 Agreed! Very disappointing! Also, neither he or Sessions have the constitutional authority to declare bump stocks or any other device illegal. Even the ATF legally should be bound to the definition of a machine gun in their enforcement.
2407 2018-02-20 21:29:52 It won't work.  Bump stocks were used in Vegas to shoot hundreds of people, but they have not been used to mow down kids at school, which is what launched this movement.
2408 2018-02-20 21:29:51 I commend @POTUS for directing @TheJusticeDept to regulate use of bump stocks, effectively banning the use of devices that can allow rifles to mimic fully automatic weapons which is what was done and used in Las Vegas massacre. Challenge @NRA to publicly support
2409 2018-02-20 21:29:51 Trump says he’s signed a memo directing the Justice Department to  propose regulations to “ban all devices” like bump stocks used in last  year’s Las Vegas massacre.  key word propose . have to see if it happen .
2410 2018-02-20 21:29:50 Obama’s ATF Approved Bump Stocks in 2010!  Just saying @BarackObama @POTUS44
2411 2018-02-20 21:29:48 Ok what about bump stocks and background checks and gun show loop holes? These are the talk points I hear shouted in my bubble.
2412 2018-02-20 21:29:48 Banning bump stocks and raising the age from 18 to 21 is a good thing! Now, (re-) start school prayer, encourage attendance at church and family prayer! God is a powerful force for good!!
2413 2018-02-20 21:29:47 This administration really thinks we're dumb. Las Vegas massacre happens where AR and bump stocks are used. "We're going to ban bump stocks"...then doesn't. Waits til everyone forgets. Then FL happens, no AR, no bump stocks...then they ban bump stocks
2414 2018-02-20 21:29:46 Do you remember the exact time trump played you for a fool? 
NOTE: 12/27/2017: "The Department of Justice (DOJ) & Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, & Explosives (ATF) have initiated a rule review that will likely lead to banning bump stocks within a year."  Trump lies.
2415 2018-02-20 21:29:45 As much as I want Bump Stocks banned along with ALL semi Automatic Weapons...doesn’t this have to go through Congress? You can’t just “direct” Sessions to ban them. You’re not the Emperor.
2416 2018-02-20 21:29:44 Trump banning bump stocks is a concession, a bone the NRA is allowing him to throw. And I thought bump stocks were banned after Vegas. MAN UP @realDonaldTrump
2417 2018-02-20 21:29:44 The Dow and S&P 500 fell on Tuesday to snap a six-session  winning streak as a sharp decline in Walmart weighed heavily, but gains  in Amazon and chip stocks helped the Nasdaq hold near the  unchanged mark.
2418 2018-02-20 21:29:42 Yeah , I agree but it seems to me to be a least option sort of a deal. I honestly do not recall any mass shootings with truly full automatic weapons since the St. Valentine's Day massacre. Bump stocks / Ok. But this idea is very light it seems.
2419 2018-02-20 21:29:42 @realDonaldTrump weren’t you going to ban bump stocks are the Vegas Shootings. Seems like are just a liar and a con man.
2420 2018-02-20 21:29:41 Bump Stocks.  Not e-f'g-nuff #TuesdayThoughts
2421 2018-02-20 21:29:32 The only mass murder using bump stocks was the Vegas massacre. They need to ban all semi automatic assault weapons, and then bump stocks become useless.
2422 2018-02-20 21:29:30 So apparently 142 days is enough time to wait before talking about Bump Stocks.  So does this mean by July 12th, and countless more mass shootings, we can finally discuss AR-15s?
2423 2018-02-20 21:29:28 @realDonaldTrump Banning bump-stocks your base isn't going to like that. @NRA Trump's Banning bump bump-stocks, hahaha but we'll see talk is cheap and his talk is really cheap!
2424 2018-02-20 21:29:23 Going to need proof of that. According to the official statement by the NRA on bump stocks, they supported more regulation handled by ATF, not banning of them.
2425 2018-02-20 21:29:23 I hope Trump band bump stocks 1. Because they seem pointlessly dangerous; and 2. Because it will annoy ‘liberals’ that he is doing more than Saint Obama on guns.
2426 2018-02-20 21:29:16 Failed to address point which was bump stocks which have no  2A implications.  I realize many Obama supporters despise the constitution and rule of law but tying to ban guns is political rhetoric & never happening dt const.  Again why did he not rid the US of bump stocks?
2427 2018-02-20 21:29:10 .@POTUS made a big deal of signing a memo asking DOJ to propose a rule, to him, on bump stocks. 

If this is like his dud after the announcement that he'd take on opioids, we're in trouble.

Also, he could/should call on Congress to pass a bill like @sethmoulton's that bans them.
2428 2018-02-20 21:29:10 Well the right wing also have kids in schools. Increasing background check criteria and stopping sales of bump stocks is reasonable to protect our kids. I also support increased security in our schools. Hire some vetted Vets!
2429 2018-02-20 21:29:10 The ATF examined such a ban a few years ago and determined that it lacked the legal authority to do it (such a ban would be thrown out by courts if challenged).  Congress needs to pass a new law to ban bump stocks.
2430 2018-02-20 21:29:09 When, exactly, has "Red America" led the way to stop gun shootings?  After Sandy Hook?  The Texas church massacre? Is it still "too soon" to mention these? 
Most gun owners support restrictions but it's your GOP and their the NRA who stops any, even bump stocks. Give us a break.
2431 2018-02-20 21:29:05 The ATF had already said the bump stocks don't turn a semi-auto rifle into a "machine gun". You're still having to squeeze that trigger for every shot fired.
2432 2018-02-20 21:28:58 @realDonaldTrump I do hope you follow through on the bump stocks. While you’re at it how about banning assault guns? (except for law enforcement and military). No private citizen has any business having one. They’re not needed for self defense or hunting.
2433 2018-02-20 21:28:55 @realDonaldTrump did the right thing regarding bump stocks today. This proves that if we are loud, they cannot ignore us! Time to keep fighting for common sense gun control!
2434 2018-02-20 21:28:55 Banning bump stocks is no where near enough to halt what's going on. We need to ban all assault style weapons.
2435 2018-02-20 21:28:52 I believe bump stocks are only legal because the ATF determined them to be legal. IF the ATR reclassifies bump stocks as illegal. It's done.
2436 2018-02-20 21:28:50 Banning Bump Stocks is an important first step, but its just the first step of many needed legislative changed. #GunReformNOW
2437 2018-02-20 21:28:48 Trump says he signed and order to outlaw bump stocks but that wasn't used in this shooting and also that's a temporary fix not a law not a bill. When he's impeached it won't mean anything.
2438 2018-02-20 21:28:47 No problem, bump stocks are a waste of money anyway.
A shoelace works just as good for recoil bump fire.
Any plans to outlaw shoelaces?
God you people are stupid.
2439 2018-02-20 21:28:45 I think I recall the NRA actually condoning a bump stock ban after Vegas, and many Republicans have gotten behind it as well. Considering auto guns are illegal, it is a bit absurd that bump stocks are not, I suppose. But I want autos legal, so
2440 2018-02-20 21:28:42 Or it will address why bump stocks came to be in the first place.
Repeal the Hughes Amendment and give responsible Americans the option to owning current production models.
#GunSense
2441 2018-02-20 21:28:41 Memo to Justice Department to propose regulations to “ban all devices” like bump stocks used in last year’s Las Vegas massacre. To propose regulations?  Just do it. Do it now. And keep going. 18 year olds should not be able to buy semi automatics. Keep going.
2442 2018-02-20 21:28:40 @POTUS  NOW you want bump stocks banned? Too little, too late. That's just a tiny pebble in a ripple of effects. My many, many friends (and I have lots and lots of friends, some even know really big words) will see you in Washington on March 24th.
2443 2018-02-20 21:28:35 How many Mass Shootings involved Bump Stocks ? I think one. How many Mass Shootings involved the AR-15? Just about all the worst ones.
2444 2018-02-20 21:28:34 KSL: Pres. Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks used in Las Vegas massacre.
2445 2018-02-20 21:28:33 @NicolleDWallace @MSNBC @jaketapper @CNN So #Trump’s going to ban bump stocks? Tell the families of the 17 people murdered at #StonemanDouglas. CRUZ DIDN’T USE A BUMP STOCK!! And the courage he’s trying to portray? THE NRA WAS FINE BANNING BUMP STOCKS. Too little, too late.
2446 2018-02-20 21:28:32 After Las Vegas we asked 

Why aren’t bump stocks illegal?

Step one now they will be 
2447 2018-02-20 21:28:30 Banning bump stocks is a great idea.   But it doesn't address the main issue, which is why the country hasn't revisited the constitutional right to bear arms.
2448 2018-02-20 21:28:28 Walmart stocks took a hit today and I will never shop there until they get rid of guns. Gun sales DO NOT belong in a Walmart.
2449 2018-02-20 21:28:27 And did you hear? He gave Stocks a bump!

Talk about a YUGE #WIN!

#Business
#WallStreet
2450 2018-02-20 21:28:26 Obviously it isn't the final measure that most left-leaning people want out of this, but bump stocks absolutely should be banned. Just need to not stop there
2451 2018-02-20 21:28:20 POTUS Donald Trump signs Documents/Memorandums & also Directs Attorney General
& the Justice Department to Ban All Firearms 
Modifications (Bump Stocks) that will result in
Automatic Gunfire from Weapons, for Civilians and
Non-Authorized Personal.   
2452 2018-02-20 21:28:17 LOL. under what authority does the Justice Department operate to ban bump stocks?
2453 2018-02-20 21:28:10 If POTUS is FOR banning bump stocks, How will Dims spin it to fit the "resist everything" strategy?
2454 2018-02-20 21:28:05 2/20/18 Market Overview: Dow: 24,964.75 (-254.63); NASDAQ: 7,234.31 (-5.16); S&P 500: 2,716.26 (-15.96) #stocks #finance
2455 2018-02-20 21:28:04 John Roberts WH reporter for Fox drilled in on Sarah Sanders at the Press briefing as if POTUS was responsible for all the shootings! John Roberts and Shepard Smith got together afterwards like the Dems they seem to be! THEY WANT TO GET RID OF THE GUNS BUMP STOCKS ETC! FIRE THEM!
2456 2018-02-20 21:28:03 @realDonaldTrump credit where credit is due, thank you for directing sessions to ban bump stocks. You have the opportunity to be the president that finally addresses gun control for the good of American citizens.
2457 2018-02-20 21:28:03 I misspoke. The ATF had been reviewing the legality of bump stocks prior to the idiots comments today taking credit.
2458 2018-02-20 21:28:02 Sales of bump stocks sales went up after the Vegas attracts after republicans refused to pass a law to ban them back then
2459 2018-02-20 21:28:01 It's cool to watch entire market cycles happen in #crypto in the time it takes for half of a dead cat bounce in stocks
2460 2018-02-20 21:28:01 What do you see as the relationship between bump stocks and the 2nd amendment?
2461 2018-02-20 21:28:00 because, clearly, the problem is fucking bump stocks and not GUNS
2462 2018-02-20 21:28:00 Big techs still the go-to stocks when bulls want to be in the mkt, but are kinda leery. Today:

$AMZN +1.4
$MSFT +0.8

vs Nasdaq -0.07%, S&P -0.6%
2463 2018-02-20 21:27:58 @realDonaldTrump takes action to ban bump stocks... why wasn’t this done straight after the Vegas shooting?
2464 2018-02-20 21:27:58 I really hope Trump rethinks the bump stocks..
2465 2018-02-20 21:27:58 Banning bump stocks is @realDonaldTrump  grabbing at low hanging fruit because there’s a loud, growing anger from teenagers and teachers and parents everywhere that will manifest as lack of votes for anyone in the NRA’s pocket in Nov. His lack of humanity is stunningly obvious.
2466 2018-02-20 21:27:58 @davidhogg111 Trump wants to ban Bump stocks
2467 2018-02-20 21:27:54 I'll commend @realdonaldtrump when he bans the AR-15 and ammo as well. Bump stocks is a start. So is implementing Sanctions on Russia.
He has much to do to earn my commending him.
2468 2018-02-20 21:27:50 I hate this orange asshole, but he ordered the ban on bump stocks... let's see how this unfolds
2469 2018-02-20 21:27:49 @NRA most likely gave him this option to try to appease but bump stocks were not the problem in Florida and will make a small difference even though as you say something is better than nothing.
2470 2018-02-20 21:27:45 @realDonaldTrump Great job on the bump stocks Mr. President! Please raise the age of gun ownership to 21 next. If it stops just one shooting its worth it!  
2471 2018-02-20 21:27:42 bump stocks = small potatoes.
2472 2018-02-20 21:27:41 Then neither will bans on bump stocks,  AR-15's and similar weapons.
2473 2018-02-20 21:27:31 Bump stocks had nothing to do with the slaughter of students in Parkland.  This is a shiny object distraction from the real issues, cynically done to provide political cover for this White House and the NRA.  #GunReformNow
2474 2018-02-20 21:27:30 But isn't that bullish for stocks ?
2475 2018-02-20 21:27:27 Kudos to Trump for moving to ban bump stocks. We will still ask for more, so I hope he doesn't think that is all that is required of him.
2476 2018-02-20 21:27:26 Actually what he did was write a memo directing Elf Sessions to propose regulations on banning bump stocks.
We will see what happens because Sessions said last year that he couldn't do this. Congress had to do it. 
More meaningless sleight of hand? Probably.
2477 2018-02-20 21:27:25 @realDonaldTrump  Your memo directing AG Sessions to take action on Bump Stocks, is a pathetic attempt at gun control.  The semi-automatic AR-15 KILLS, not the BUMP STOCK.  Your action is like throwing the dead a #BONE.
2478 2018-02-20 21:27:24 Right because we believe what Trump says. Besides we want AR-15 banned not just bump stocks because it is too easy to turn them into killing machines. He’s too late and those kids are angry and we are all with them!
2479 2018-02-20 21:27:19 The banning of bump stocks is a win for everyone. Most importantly, kids. #GunReform #Trump
2480 2018-02-20 21:27:16 Trump giving instructions to ban bump stocks is a sign that our kids are our future! Keep on marching you young inspirations! #neveragain
2481 2018-02-20 21:27:16 'favoring improving background checks' isn't doing anything. Come on man! And if he wants to ban bump stocks he ought to talk to his pals in Congress. Ya know. Where laws are made.
2482 2018-02-20 21:27:12 @realDonaldTrump so you'll propose a ban on bump stocks that are making it easier to kill our kids but you'll make an executive order to ban immigrants from certain countries on the highly unlikely chance they're terrorists? SCHOOL SHOOTERS ARE TERRORISTS.
2483 2018-02-20 21:27:12 I think they are lying to us. The Vegas shooter was using fully automatic machine guns, NOT bump stocks.
2484 2018-02-20 21:27:10 Trump directing Sessions to ban bump stocks? Sounds like someone, I'm not mentioning any names (@NRA) is going to want their 30 million back....
2485 2018-02-20 21:27:09 There was movement against the bump stocks after Las Vegas, but the Democrats wouldn't pass a simple bill on the subject.  They tried to add the kitchen sink, and the bill sank.  It seemed as if your party was scared of the consequences of ACTION on guns.
2486 2018-02-20 21:27:09 @realDonaldTrump Good start with the bump stocks. Now let's do something big, like get rid of the assault-type weapons. That will make a difference.
2487 2018-02-20 21:27:09 Obama outlawed bump stocks.
POTUS made them legal again.
2488 2018-02-20 21:27:04 Bump stocks can be replicated with a rubber band only.
2489 2018-02-20 21:27:01 President Trump, with the powers conferred upon him as President, as issued a memorandum directing the Attorney General to begin the process of banning bump stocks.
2490 2018-02-20 21:26:58 He negotiated that with the NRA
TRUMP:"What can I give them to get them off my back?"
NRA: Nothing
TRUMP: Come on, I need something pleeease!
NRA: Fine... Bump stocks
2491 2018-02-20 21:26:53 @realDonaldTrump love you MR PRESIDENT.   Please don't band Bump stocks and the AR.  We use them in a safe manor.
2492 2018-02-20 21:26:50 To be clear, banning bump stocks is all fine and good. It's also nowhere near an acceptable response, by itself, to Parkland (or every other mass shooting).
2493 2018-02-20 21:26:48 I guess don jr doesn’t have any buddies who make bump stocks.
2494 2018-02-20 21:26:45 He should have gone bold...sign an executive order banning bump stocks and AR-15's. Follow that up with returning all donations from the NRA.
2495 2018-02-20 21:26:32 "something called bump stocks exist" is the headline I need
2496 2018-02-20 21:26:28 imma go out on a limb and say idgaf about bump stocks rn and would prefer legit background checks to any other reform but thats just me
2497 2018-02-20 21:26:24 A step in the right direction...  

IMHO, the now illegal bump stocks are more of a novelty for gun owner's to play with while target shooting or criminal gangs to hopefully use on one another.
2498 2018-02-20 21:26:21 If the other car loan is not at 0%, I would roll it there. If it is and your mortgage loan percent is low, then buy more value or dividend stocks.
2499 2018-02-20 21:26:21 Trump directs AG to draft rule banning "bump stocks." Move bypasses Congress, preempting legislation that likey would be tougher and include action on background check.
2500 2018-02-20 21:26:19 So you’re against banning bump stocks?
2501 2018-02-20 21:26:19 Time to lead the way Mr. President on sensible gun restrictions as Congress has shown itself unable to ban bump stocks and similar.
2502 2018-02-20 21:26:17 Bump stocks are an amusing toy. If they were really dangerous, serious professional shooters and killers would use them. Banning them is about as effective re: reducing gun deaths as banning pink guns would be.
2503 2018-02-20 21:26:10 Bump stocks should be banned. They are simply work arounds for breaking an existing law.
2504 2018-02-20 21:26:10 @realDonaldTrump has signed a memorandum to ban bump stocks turning semi into autos.. sorry guys shootings cannot be modified! Just bloody ban guns it’s simple
2505 2018-02-20 21:26:07 NEW: President Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks used in Las Vegas massacre. -@AP
2506 2018-02-20 21:26:05 For the same reason Trump takes credit when stocks are up, but disappears when they fall.  There’s the answer to your typical DOTARD question.
2507 2018-02-20 21:25:56 @realDonaldTrump   No Trump the ban on bump stocks is not good enough. Shooter in last weeks school shooting didn’t use one.
2508 2018-02-20 21:25:55 I REFUSE to give praise to trump for doing something that ANY reasonable person should have done ages ago, particularly after the Vegas massacre. Great, he signed a law to ban bump stocks.

AND? How about gun age law? How about background check? How about protecting our children?
2509 2018-02-20 21:25:55 Semi-automatic weapons WITH bump stocks can fire 400-800 rounds per minute. Without bump stocks? 45-60 rounds per minute.
2510 2018-02-20 21:25:52 Trump directing to ban bump stocks... no.
2511 2018-02-20 21:25:51 @realDonaldTrump If you are banning bump fire stocks.  Do not ban anything else.
2512 2018-02-20 21:25:49 BREAKING: President Trump has directed the Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks.
2513 2018-02-20 21:25:48 Bump stocks are so last month.  Why isn't he banning assault rifles?
2514 2018-02-20 21:25:48 Congressman @TGowdySC just said on @FaceTheNation that he thinks @ATFHQ could ban bump stocks - and simply. Legislation might not be necessary.
2515 2018-02-20 21:25:45 Repeats the canard of bump stocks multiplying the rate of fire. They allow continuous fire but at no greater rate than the trigger would have allowed.
2516 2018-02-20 21:25:45 Trump just directed the AG to create regulations that will ban bump stocks. This is one time that I will say thank you to him. Lets keep this going.
2517 2018-02-20 21:25:45 I made my points: 

Change your gun laws 

Guns don’t kill people, people kill people, but people with guns kill a lot of people 

Regulate, don’t confiscate 

Bye bump stocks
2518 2018-02-20 21:25:42 Trump last night: what should I do about guns?
Someone at Mar-A-Lago: get rid of bump stocks.
Trump today: I’m getting rid of bump stocks.
2519 2018-02-20 21:25:41 Now comes the rush to buy bump stocks...
2520 2018-02-20 21:25:35 That's reasonable.. our second ammendment has no provisions for bump stocks.
2521 2018-02-20 21:25:34 damnit trump put an order in to ban alterations like bump stocks. i need to buy one before we cant get them. but to be honest its a good start for trump to help with the gun issues. but still fuck the senators and congressmen who do nothing.
2522 2018-02-20 21:25:33 Trump is trying to ban bump stocks  , interesting to see what @NRA will think of that one lol
2523 2018-02-20 21:25:33 You know they will say that bump stocks are irrelevant.

If he is signalling, it won't be to woke kids.
2524 2018-02-20 21:25:32 I don't care what they are telling us. I think he was NOT using bump stocks but fully automatic machine guns.
2525 2018-02-20 21:25:31 The name bump stocks will be changed so gun companies can keep selling them!
2526 2018-02-20 21:25:28 "Trump says." This is NOT taking action on bump stocks - the DOJ has already said this is not under their purview. You might make the effort to point that out.
2527 2018-02-20 21:25:16 @realDonaldTrump We are not fooled by your damn memo on bump stocks. NRA agreed to this to cover weak @GOP candidates in 2018. WE CALL B.S!
2528 2018-02-20 21:25:11 Trump directing Sessions to propose a ban on bump stocks is curious since such bills have already been written. This could be voted on next week. Slow walk tactic?
2529 2018-02-20 21:25:08 Just reading some of the reaction to trump's memo re: banning bump stocks...people need to give it a rest sometimes. You look worse than they do...so petty
2530 2018-02-20 21:25:06 He said the same thing after the Vegas Strip shooting and then took no action. If/when the ink is dry on the bill banning bump stocks and funding for enforcement of the ban, then it would be time to acknowledge this, but not before.
2531 2018-02-20 21:25:04 Is having an initiative to ban and banning the same thing? Also, as I understand it, the NRA is also for banning bump stocks so this could have been done along time ago.
2532 2018-02-20 21:25:02 Assault rifles, among other guns, must be banned.  Period. Stop.  Not just bump stocks. And you reporters need to find the gumption to call Sanders a fricking LIAR. OMG!  #resist #arresttrump
2533 2018-02-20 21:25:00 Credit where credit is due Trump is banning bump stocks that turn semi-automatics into automatics. Now reverse last year’s law allowing those with mental health issues to buy guns, ban semi-automatics. Show leadership and stand up for children against the NRA
2534 2018-02-20 21:25:00 Banning bump stocks is like if iPhones were deadly and you’re banning the iPhone cases... #GunContol
2535 2018-02-20 21:24:55 @realDonaldTrump your memo re Bump Stocks is too little too late, time for real change! #playgroundpolitics
2536 2018-02-20 21:24:52 i fully expect Republicans who believe in the 2nd amendment and defended their "right" to bump stocks after vegas to disown and disavow Trump for attacking your rights, because we both know that's exactly what you would have done if this were Obama
2537 2018-02-20 21:24:43 How can she stand up there and say bump stocks are on the table to discuss. Many people in Las Vegas were murdered because of this legal attachment that he bought easily. Think these are delaying tactics Trump is using hoping the outrage will go away again & nothing will be done.
2538 2018-02-20 21:24:40 We already have a system in place for fully automatic firearms. Bump stocks should fall under this category, but technically they don't.
2539 2018-02-20 21:24:38 Fine with me. Bump stocks are for novices.
2540 2018-02-20 21:24:38 Bump stocks. What good is that if you have AK-47 and AR-15 readily available? It's a joke.
2541 2018-02-20 21:24:34 President Trump is directing the Justice Department to take steps to prohibit gun modifications like so-called bump stocks.
2542 2018-02-20 21:24:33 Not really - bump stocks move the rifle around your shoulder constantly changing your aiming point, site alignment and site picture.  Automatic weapons do not do that although they do have a tendency of pulling the round patten up and to the right during continuous fire..
2543 2018-02-20 21:24:31 The timing of this announcement is awfully convenient. You would think he would have tweeted by now that in Dec he asked Jeff Sessions to look into bump stocks. I call BS. He’s afraid of the bus loads of students headed his way.
2544 2018-02-20 21:24:22 Only when the ban on bump stocks go through, then and only then will I give him credit.
2545 2018-02-20 21:24:22 @SarahKSilverman, I'm following your lead. I've been kindly pushing gun control w/pro-NRA/Trumpers from hs on FB. A "don't take our guns" guy eventually agreed w/univ. bkgd chcks, closing gun show/internet sale loopholes, no guns for DV abusers, ban on bump stocks. There is hope!
2546 2018-02-20 21:24:22 Obama approved bump stocks because Obama.had NRA money up his azz.
2547 2018-02-20 21:24:21 Trump signs memo recommending AG ban bump stocks — devices that turn weapons into 'machine guns'...
2548 2018-02-20 21:24:17 @realDonaldTrump wow banning bump stocks, that’s barely a move.  why not ban people from buying #AR15 ????  Seriously does the #NRA own you that much. Get a backbone #MAGA
2549 2018-02-20 21:24:11 Actually he said “all devices” that turn guns into machine guns. Let’s hold him to to that. Legislation should include conversion kits for hand guns and rifles, bump stocks, large capacity clips and assault weapons themselves. #GunReformNow
2550 2018-02-20 21:24:09 Did you hear? Congress is going to ban bump stocks; every Monday between 4 and 7 PM Eastern Standard Time.
2551 2018-02-20 21:24:06 Significant move by Trump on gun control - attempting to ban "bump stocks". Stephen Paddock used them in the Las Vegas massacre to turn his weapons into automatic firearms. He killed 58 people in a matter of minutes.
2552 2018-02-20 21:23:57 Banning bump stocks is a step in the right direction, but we need to totally #BanAssaultWeapons .. we also need the @NRA OUT of politics
#NRAIsATerroristOrganization 
Better #GunControlNow
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @PressSec @FLGovScott @marcorubio @GOP
2553 2018-02-20 21:23:56 Yeah, the bump stocks thing has been around since the Vegas shooting, months ago
2554 2018-02-20 21:23:55 I give a lot of credit to Trump for pushing to ban bump stocks. At last, the president is making a move that actually benefits the majority of Americans.
2555 2018-02-20 21:23:55 Trump is going to see what he can do about banning bump stocks.

This is LITERALLY the least he can do. I also predict the GOP prevents this from happening.
2556 2018-02-20 21:23:54 Bump stocks are the lowest hanging fruit. Let's keep going.
2557 2018-02-20 21:23:53 If the reports that Trump wants to ban bump stocks are correct, I will give credit where it’s due. That is the right thing to do. But it is also nowhere near enough to solve the problem. It’s not enough for him to say he’s even really making an attempt to solve it.
2558 2018-02-20 21:23:52 @FoxNews The bump fire stocks area non issue n is smoke n mirrors .. las vegas shooter had plenty of rifles n ammo to do same or worse damage w/o bump stock .. no one had heard of them before or since
2559 2018-02-20 21:23:47 Take away the semiautomatic rifles there is no use for bump stocks. Transparent effort to appear to do something. #TrumpSleaze
2560 2018-02-20 21:23:45 Bump stocks are certainly a problem, but they're not THE problem.
2561 2018-02-20 21:23:40 I agree, this is offering a crumb to a starving person. Mr. President...bump stocks were Las Vegas and not Parkland. Ask yourself, if there is a lower common denominator that can be addressed.
2562 2018-02-20 21:23:39 No I think the excuse I've read is we need bump stocks because they're "fun"
2563 2018-02-20 21:23:39 Too little, too late. We must ban all assault weapons, not just bump stocks. #GunReformNow
2564 2018-02-20 21:23:33 Hey @realDonaldTrump, if you think we’re going to be satisfied with banning bump stocks, think again. That should have been done back in October. You don’t get points for turning in your assignment 4 months late. #GunReformNow #GunControlNow
2565 2018-02-20 21:23:30 This is the easiest step he could take. The NRA was against bump stocks, too, after Las Vegas. After this, if it happens, he'll wipe his hands together and declare, "Well, our job is done!".
2566 2018-02-20 21:23:27 LO ÚLTIMO | Presidente Trump firma memorándum exigiéndole al fiscal General de EE.UU., Jeff Sessions que prohíba dispositivos que convierten armas de fuego en ametralladoras, después de los ‘bump stocks’ usados en la masacre de Las Vegas.
2567 2018-02-20 21:23:26 Well, finally Trump is taking action in supporting the ban on bump stocks. I think assalt riles will be next. I'm for #2ndAmendment  but not assault rifles
2568 2018-02-20 21:23:24 President Trump says that he has signed a memo directing the Department of Justice to develop regulations to ban bump stocks.
2569 2018-02-20 21:23:23 No, not a priority. After Las Vegas, they sold out of the bump stocks. After every mass shooting, gun stores are swamped.
2570 2018-02-20 21:23:10 I propose a six month buy back program on assault weapons funded by NRA,outlawing them w mandatory sentences after grace period include bump stocks& high capacity mags conversion kits are life w/o parole Period  NRA has so much $ can afford it instead of campaigns.

pax
2571 2018-02-20 21:23:10 No, the ATF concluded it does not have the authority to ban the stocks under current law
2572 2018-02-20 21:23:07 This is merely a stop gap measure. Easy to ban bump stocks, BAN MILITARY STYLE ASSAULT RIFLES then you're doing the job
2573 2018-02-20 21:23:06 Apparently, Trump has directed the Justice Department to ban bump stocks. I hope your organization realizes this does not go far enough. Even without a bump stock, the AR-15 is a killing machine designed to inflict maximum harm and needs to be banned!  Never Again
2574 2018-02-20 21:23:06 Trump wants some ineffectual proposition to hide behind and say he is taking action. Banning bump-stocks is his way of doing nothing to curb gun violence, for the very reasons you state. It’s political cynicism.
2575 2018-02-20 21:23:02 @realDonaldTrump Bump stocks aren't enough. We won't stop until weapons of mass destruction, AKA AR-15s and other high capacity weapons, are banned. Buckle up.
2576 2018-02-20 21:22:58 Banning Bump stocks is better than nothing. Good job.
2577 2018-02-20 21:22:55 Was this so hard? Trump signs memo recommending AG Sessions ban 'bump stocks' — devices that turn weapons into 'machine guns'
2578 2018-02-20 21:22:55 Wow @realDonaldTrump it’s taken your so called “Administration” 5 months and you want to talk about banning bump-stocks!! We say “to little to late!!” The American people want comprehensive gun control!! #GunControlNOW #MarchForOurLives please listen to the students of Parkland!!
2579 2018-02-20 21:22:49 @Potus is boarding our 2nd Amendment tights on the slippery slope. Bump stocks were not involved. It’s mentally ill ppl not guns. Secure schools with armed guards & hold @FBI accountable for failing again.
2580 2018-02-20 21:22:49 Profits before priorities.  I sometimes wonder how much their gun stocks on Wall Street are worth to them?  Anyone ever do a study on public servant's?
2581 2018-02-20 21:22:46 Trump trynna ban bump stocks that’s a reasonable step I think we can all get behind, right?
2582 2018-02-20 21:22:43 To be fair, bump stocks played a pivotal role in the shooting in Fl- oh. Nope.
2583 2018-02-20 21:22:43 uwah, Obama's shit. Obama approved.bump stocks in the first place.
2584 2018-02-20 21:22:43 Aren’t bump stocks just an irrelevant pawn in all this? Do they even matter?
2585 2018-02-20 21:22:31 @thehill They are scrambling to catch up, bump stocks, election interference and the cliff hanger SHS left us with. Don't bother
2586 2018-02-20 21:22:30 Devil is in details. Dems legislation to ban bump fire stocks was worded so poorly (intentionally?) that rubber bands would be illegal.
2587 2018-02-20 21:22:29 Excellent job!  Great to see you on TV and sticking to strength #QQQ stocks.
2588 2018-02-20 21:22:26 Did you notice that Trump had some difficulty describing "bump stocks". I got the impression that he didn't really understand the subject matter. Nothing new with that I suppose.
2589 2018-02-20 21:22:22 @CNN @ABC @NYTIMES @WASHINGTONPOST @MSNBC @CBSNews @cnbc @
@FoxBusiness as I said before interest rates must be increased because of this new Trump tax bracket. Has nothing to do with economic growth. More like Trump economic disaster. Look, stocks may continue to fall.
2590 2018-02-20 21:22:15 I mean, bump stocks are something that should be banned anyway but I just read there's grounds for a ban to be challenged in court too, so
2591 2018-02-20 21:22:15 BREAKING: President Trump has instructed the Justice Department to ban bumping stocks with Your Mom
2592 2018-02-20 21:22:14 @POTUS  please do not band Bump Stocks.  I love to shoot with mine.  Nothing wrong with my stock as I am legiel.
2593 2018-02-20 21:22:14 With the proposed ban on bump stocks, the Trump Administration will have enacted more gun restrictions than 8 full years of the Obama Administration. And the Left will still wail that it's not enough.
2594 2018-02-20 21:22:08 correct. bump stocks exist bc they circumvent current firing mech laws. Ryan is claiming DOJ should do it so he doesn't have to vote on new GC legislation.
2595 2018-02-20 21:22:07 Sane gun owners matter a lot because they're not anti legislation if assured an outright gun ban isn't in the offing. In the case of bump stocks specifically they matter because they've little reason to oppose banning a thing they think makes a gun worse.
2596 2018-02-20 21:22:03 He gets paid for this! Great advice and great job CNBC for always putting him on TV to hurt the small investors. The information that he has and he was long RIOT, CNBC should not put him on anymore!#stocks #markets #RIOT #CNBC #DennisGartman #shame
2597 2018-02-20 21:22:02 To clarify, Class III weapons and accessories aren't banned items - they require a special license from the ATF to own. Grenade launchers and machine guns, included.

Bump fire stocks should be included.
2598 2018-02-20 21:21:58 I watched a report on using bump stocks. The guy showing how they work had a beer gut, and he made a point of showing us his gut is just as effective at pushing the trigger back into his finger as a bump stock.

#BanBeerGuts
2599 2018-02-20 21:21:56 I own guns and am smart enough to know assault weapons, bump stocks/kits, background checks, mental health screens and training are all issues.

She gets death threats from gun maniacs  Joe...dont be coy.

Life comes before Liberty & the Pursuit of happiness. Don't forget that

2602 2018-02-20 21:21:36 I am quite happy with trumps latest decision to ban bump stocks and other modifications to weapons @realDonaldTrump
2603 2018-02-20 21:21:26 So the criminals will have bump stocks but the ppl are just screwed. The moment you do this, you are on the path to making the lawful targets & the lawless advantaged. You can't close the can of worms once you open it.
2604 2018-02-20 21:21:26 Better than what the previous 4 administrations did about bump stocks. Nothing. All that needs to be done is the ATF change it's approval of the bump stock, and it will be illegal.
2605 2018-02-20 21:21:26 Trump directs attorney general to create regulations to ban 'bump stocks' -- The Washington Post
2606 2018-02-20 21:21:16 Isn’t this is already law? Thought you can’t modify a gun.  Also assume this means bump stocks will be made illegal.
2607 2018-02-20 21:21:15 So Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun mods like bump stocks…hey #Trump: THAT’S NOT HOW LAWS WORK, KNUCKLEHEAD!!!

2609 2018-02-20 21:21:14 Trump is talking about banning bump stocks because it's a meaningless gesture that will have no effect on future gun violence atrocities.
2610 2018-02-20 21:21:12 Why start with bump stocks??? Give us more than that and that’s not going to take these kids tomorrow night.....nope. @sarahchad_ @MomsDemand @Everytown
2611 2018-02-20 21:21:04 Huzzah!  #trump just signed a love letter to banning bump stocks in response to another mass shooting they had nothing to do with.  Will he, or won’t he do anything at all to protect our children before the next mass shooting? #AssaultWeaponsBan #GunReformNow #NowIsTheTime
2612 2018-02-20 21:21:02 Ok, #1October was October first

Tried compromise (treat bump stocks like machine guns)

Hasn’t worked because gun loving toads want their bump stocks without accountability
2613 2018-02-20 21:20:56 Just wondering the @NRA take on trump sayings ban bump stocks?
2614 2018-02-20 21:20:56 @DonaldJTrumpJr Nooo! Don't ban bump stocks!! NEVER capitulate to the Globalists! PPLLEEAASSEE
2615 2018-02-20 21:20:54 Whatever the motivation, if it comes to pass (biiig “if”) at least banning bump stocks would be something productive from Trump.
2616 2018-02-20 21:20:51 Obama’s ATF Approved Bump Stocks in 2010..   just saying @BarackObama #atf @realDonaldTrump
2617 2018-02-20 21:20:50 Thoughts on making bump stocks unavailable for purchase by citizens?
2618 2018-02-20 21:20:49 Breaking. *Trump Orders Ban of AR-15 ‘Bump Stocks’ After Florida Shooting @business @BloombergTV
2619 2018-02-20 21:20:49 What ever happened to the bill Dianne Feinstein put forward about banning bump stocks? Why did it never get supported by anyone?
2620 2018-02-20 21:20:46 If this ban on bump stocks actually happens I wont Tweet about DT
for one entire week. Odds are NOT GONNA ACTUALLY HAPPEN!
2621 2018-02-20 21:20:42 Trump moves to ban bump stocks. Is it me, or are we running a tragedy behind?  Bump stocks are SO Las Vegas. #speeditupPOTUS
2622 2018-02-20 21:20:39 What the hell does bump stocks have to do with the school shooting??
2623 2018-02-20 21:20:39 This was brought up in the wake of the Vegas shootings and only now faced with dozens more lives lost in the interim he can be bothered to at least say he'll act on bump stocks? Actions speak louder than words so I'm not cheering yet...
2624 2018-02-20 21:20:36 He just signed an EO directing DOJ AG to immediately ban all bump stocks and anything else that can make a gun go fully-auto.  He says legislation is coming but he wants it to start now.  If he doesn't sign a bill, then he'll look a lot like Obama with DACA.  But I like the move.
2625 2018-02-20 21:20:35 Someone should ask him to define *bump stocks* - I think he thinks it has something to do with the stock market and would affect his financial situation. #IllegitimatePresident
2626 2018-02-20 21:20:34 yeah it's harder to add liquidity on tighter spread stocks.  another reason why i favor $UVXY
2627 2018-02-20 21:20:32 Why in the hell didn’t he do that after LasVegas? - there were no bump stocks in the last shooting. Why isn’t he talking about high capacity clips? Why doesn’t he talk about how the NRA has lawmakers in their pockets?
2628 2018-02-20 21:20:32 It isn't,  fully automatic weapons are already illegal and bump stocks have already proven to be legal , it's a diversion so they can be seen to be doing something when actually doing nothing .
2629 2018-02-20 21:20:29 Hey remember how Congress was gonna ban bump stocks after the last mass shooting?
2630 2018-02-20 21:20:27 "Kill the NRA" Common Sense Gun Laws is all that are being requested. 
Today Bump Stocks were banned. 7 Mos too late for Las Vegas but good 
Gun buybacks every weekend at churches
SIMPLE RENEWAL of assault style weapons which sunset 2004
Raise ownership to 21yo
Good start !
2631 2018-02-20 21:20:25 The NRA advised Obama against bump-stocks, but the smartest man in the country legalized them anyway!  I guess he somehow made money from it.  After all, that what is was all about, right, Barry?
2632 2018-02-20 21:20:23 Will conservatives still defend the police state when formerly law abiding gun owners are raided and arrested for owing the suddenly illegal bump stocks?
2633 2018-02-20 21:20:22 had to wait till all the bump stocks were sold and back orders delivered .... worthless @realDonaldTrump
2634 2018-02-20 21:20:22 Thank you @POTUS Bumb stocks are a good start. Require all social media sites to carry an 'alert' button to report posts that meet 'designated criteria' for a possible need to investigate or intervene. Raise the age to buy an assault weapon.
2635 2018-02-20 21:20:17 this would have happened in the past but legislators keep trying to jam in other bans. Last time they went to ban bump stocks, they lumped in silencers, mag sizes, etc..
2636 2018-02-20 21:20:11 @realDonaldTrump Banning bump stocks is a good start. You need to outlaw ANY modifications to the AR-15 that causes them to be automatic, as well as authorize confiscation of these altered weapons. Close the gun show and online loopholes also!! PLEASE!
2637 2018-02-20 21:20:10 My bias re stocks is that lower lows are coming, but more backing and filling’s coming over the next five to seven TDs. An up down up sequence where the second up falters sets the mkt up for a retest at a minimum.
2638 2018-02-20 21:20:04 Have you seen the stocks
2639 2018-02-20 21:20:03 How can I kill the troops and cops  who plan on taking over the govt and imposing communist rule on me without “muh bump stocks”
2640 2018-02-20 21:20:02 @realDonaldTrump Nooooo! Don't ban bump stocks... Never capitulate to the Globalists
2641 2018-02-20 21:19:58 NRA winked to green light Trump on bump stocks, certainly not their big priority.
2642 2018-02-20 21:19:58 How many bump stocks exist in the wild vs. how many AR-15s exist? I recognize that an AR-15 isn't a fully automatic weapon by default but this reeks of regulating a niche add-on to throw people looking for safety regulation a bone. In reality, it will affect very few.
2643 2018-02-20 21:19:57 "Trump moves to ban bump stocks"

but....but....but....

he's INFRINGING!!????
2644 2018-02-20 21:19:52 Gio!...where were you?!! There was so much hoopla, it was even revealed that Obama legalized bump stocks in 2010.
2645 2018-02-20 21:19:47 So he's going to ban bump stocks but not Russian officials. #TrumpRussia #GunReformNow
2646 2018-02-20 21:19:45 Why are the most vocal on #GunControl often the most ignorant?

I'm indifferent on bump stocks, but they do not turn a rifle into a "machine gun." It's still a semi-auto rifle. This is 2018's "pistol grip"
2647 2018-02-20 21:19:45 Wouldn’t need to worry about bump stocks if he did the right thing and made assault rifles illegal.
2648 2018-02-20 21:19:40 Actually the ATF once again ruled bump stocks were not illegal. They did this during the previous administration and this one.
2649 2018-02-20 21:19:36 He’s not banning bump stocks. He’s passing it to the AG and requesting action. It’s not even symbolic action.
2650 2018-02-20 21:19:35 My thoughts exactly, but hey...if it gets rid of bump stocks it wasn’t for nothing !
2651 2018-02-20 21:19:32 Hey @peternbell look whos on #twitter @KerrMines #follow #jrmining #undervalued #openpit #Arizona #Copperstone #buythedip #gold #copper #proven #resource #commodities #stocks
2652 2018-02-20 21:19:27 The NRA has been willing to throw bump stocks under the bus since Las Vegas. I haven't read anything about a bump stock being used in this school shooting.
2653 2018-02-20 21:19:19 Bump stocks aren't "arms" they're an accessory.  Now if only someone can make the same argument for hand guns.
2654 2018-02-20 21:19:17 You do realise bump stocks make guns less accurate? Right?
2655 2018-02-20 21:19:15 Bout damn time.  Now how do you get the bump stocks that’s already been sold off the street?
2656 2018-02-20 21:19:13 So we dont even know what the hell went on in Vegas, even on a basic level, and we are talking about freaken bump stocks??
2657 2018-02-20 21:19:10 So @realDonaldTrump finally goes ahead and Bans bump stocks, but he hasn't thought about banning AR-15 Rifles. WHEN WILL IT END? #oneless
2658 2018-02-20 21:19:10 Your president is calling for regulations banning bump stocks TODAY

This is just the beginning 


2659 2018-02-20 21:19:10 If Trump thinks that is all that needs to be done, he is sadly mistaken! Bump stocks is what should have happened after Vegas massacre!
2660 2018-02-20 21:19:09 @PressSec Three days after the Las Vegas shooting, @SenFeinstein introduced a bill banning bump stocks — nothing happened because it was ‘too soon’ to make ‘hasty’ decisions involving guns. How many shootings w/ semi-automatic weapons have taken place since then? #GunReformNow
2661 2018-02-20 21:19:07 Trump Directs Justice Department To Ban Bump Stocks 
CLICK BELOW FOR FULL STORY.....
2662 2018-02-20 21:19:07 select fires are legal with tax stamp. slide fire stocks should be also. read up on street sweeper shotguns which were banned.
2663 2018-02-20 21:19:06 @KTREnews He didn't direct them to actually ban bump stocks, he directed them to LOOK INTO banning them. BIG DIFFERENCE. All he signed was a memo. It's all for the optics of it.
2664 2018-02-20 21:19:03 No Piers.  Bump stocks do not "convert semi-automatic guns into machine guns." For as much yapping as you do on this issue, I would think educating yourself on the matter would be a prudent thing to do.  #Clueless
2665 2018-02-20 21:19:02 I believe that bump stocks are a PRODUCT OF REGULATION. Arms manufacturers wanted to make a collapsable stock but regulation required the trigger be made inoperable with the stock closed. Of course I can't prove that but it is how I believe they came about.
2666 2018-02-20 21:18:58 @realDonaldTrump DO NOT ban bump stocks, Mr. President! The democrats are the ones killing us. Don't take away part of our defense! 

@DonaldJTrumpJr #bumpstocks
2667 2018-02-20 21:18:57 BREAKING:  President Donald Trump ruled US Justice Department to ban gun modifications such as bump stocks used in Las Vegas massacre. #59News
2668 2018-02-20 21:18:57 Attorney General Jeff Sessions banned bump stocks at Trump’s wink and the gun. Kill the NRA could just be a PSYOP to increase sales. I have yet to see poster board do much else.
2669 2018-02-20 21:18:48 Trump sounds like he is drugged or being forced to give the statement on bump stocks he is reading.  Doesn't sound at all natural.  His speech writers have failed him.
2670 2018-02-20 21:18:45 @realDonaldTrump PROPOSES @AGJeffBSessions to ban Bump Stocks. This is Feb and the #LV shooting happened Oct 1. Don’t get me wrong it’s a good move but it’s just a distraction from the #AR15 discussion. You think if you give a penny no one will care about the dollar. #WhatALoser
2671 2018-02-20 21:18:40 What do you use in scan for CSE stocks "exchange=?"? What do you put after equal sign? Thanks
2672 2018-02-20 21:18:37 No, you are. Because you don't want to admit that he's right, that we're right, that even Trump knows we're right as just now he pushed for a ban on bump stocks. And you didn't decide to comment on the poor father either because everyone knows we are right expect you
2673 2018-02-20 21:18:35 One of the best ways to destroy a semi
is to convert it and melt the barrel.
Bump stocks do not enhance accuracy.
If someone enters your home
you have to control the bullet to prevent collateral damage.

2677 2018-02-20 21:18:32 So @realDonaldTrump response to the FL shooting is to ban bump stocks that were used in the Vegas shooting. Mans got a stellar reaction time.
2678 2018-02-20 21:18:28 Bye-bye Obama era who allow bump stocks.
2679 2018-02-20 21:18:25 Despite my thoughts or feelings on trump, when he does something good I’ll acknowledge it. Banning bump stocks is good. I’m glad he’s doing it
2680 2018-02-20 21:18:22 Don't be an asshole and start insulting. 
Bumpfire and slidefire stocks are ridiculous gimmicks. Outlaw them. Nobody cares. They do does convert a semi auto to select fire. That has already been determined by the BATF.
2681 2018-02-20 21:18:16 #BREAKING President Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks used in Las Vegas massacre.
2682 2018-02-20 21:18:10 Not enough @realDonaldTrump. How many of the shootings in the past year involved bump stocks? We know they all involved AR-15’s. If you think this will satisfy all the kids from #ParklandStudents, I think you are wrong. Just more deflecting from you.
2683 2018-02-20 21:18:07 Narrator: He completely forgot about bump stocks until it was brought up in the daily press briefing 20 minutes ago.
2684 2018-02-20 21:18:05 RT KLFY "RT AP: BREAKING: President Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks used in Las Vegas massacre."
2685 2018-02-20 21:18:03 Did the #Parkland shooter use bump stocks?! Now you want to address Vegas after another tragedy to try and distract?!?
2686 2018-02-20 21:18:01 My thought exactly. It would have been a better response immediately following Vegas. Bump stocks weren't involved in Parkland.
2687 2018-02-20 21:18:01 means nothing will happen. look at the statement "clarify if bump stocks are illegal"
2688 2018-02-20 21:17:57 This is a nothing gesture to try and placate people, Bump stocks will be found legal and fully automatic weapons are already illegal . This is a diversion from the multitude of problems that contribute the the US epidemic of gun violence
2689 2018-02-20 21:17:55 The US already has gun control. They’re literally hundreds of laws on the books. 

They can scream about banning guns all the want, but it’s never going to happen. I say let them have the bump stocks and trigger cranks if it makes them feel better. Just my .02
2690 2018-02-20 21:17:55 WOW. Trump showing bold imaginative leadership - mustering courage to tell his errand boy Sessions to begin formulating ways to evaluate & study the historical question "Are bump stocks illegal"; maybe convene committee. Then MAYBE a ban can be imposed ( a dreaded regulation)
2691 2018-02-20 21:17:53 Lots of tweets suggested it too
None of them had the power to regulate bump stocks either
2692 2018-02-20 21:17:52 WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks used in Las Vegas massacre.
2693 2018-02-20 21:17:50 The "Theme" that's being priced into U.S. Stocks now is:

"U.S. tax law changes & higher interest rates"

2695 2018-02-20 21:17:48 It’s a gift to the NRA. They were ok to ban bump stocks a long time ago. Trump just wants to make you THINK he is doing something. He really isn’t
2696 2018-02-20 21:17:45 You are correct. But, I’m assuming they’re expanding it to include things like bump stocks and trigger cranks…difficult, since you can “bump-fire” with a finger through a belt loop and can manufacture a trigger crank. Both are considered novelty items among real gun enthusiasts.
2697 2018-02-20 21:17:40 @realDonaldTrump Hey idiot, you gunna ban serrated knives next? What the fuck is banning bump stocks going do to suppress the clinically proven ticking time bomb of a human from killing innocent people???? he'll still have the gun and still be a fucking psycho so GOOD TRY.
2698 2018-02-20 21:17:36 I imagine it's probably not that hard to add them to the same list of restricted accessories as suppressors. What, if anything, can be done about the bump stocks already out there is what will have them scratching heads.
2699 2018-02-20 21:17:35 If the DOJ can ban bump stocks, what else can it ban? Like right now.
2700 2018-02-20 21:17:32 YOU LYING YUCK MOUTH PIG!! Flynn stopped the Russians from retaliating, Drumpf wanted to return the compounds that OBAMA took away with sanctions."Adoptions" =Magnisky Act! 2012 SANCTIONS!
Btw, banning bump stocks is to keep the noise down. YOU all are
Pathetic trash! @PressSec
2701 2018-02-20 21:17:26 I have been schooled on twitter, being cheap is worthless.  I should only be buying things that grow. Having cash is stupid... My advice if investors want growth forget stocks and invest in $BTC.

2703 2018-02-20 21:17:11 @realDonaldTrump DO NOT VOTE TO DISARM US AND BAN BUMP STOCKS. THAT'S NOT WHY YOU PUT YOU IN OFFICE!

2708 2018-02-20 21:17:06 Unbelievably spineless. Their idea of gun reform is to have a look at one day maybe talking about sometime in the near or far future getting a committee together to perhaps ask the NRA if it's ok with them to pretty please limit the use of...bump stocks...gutless.
2709 2018-02-20 21:17:05 $TTPH moving after hours woth news. Let's see tomorrow. Maybe a big move after that huge gap down 3 days ago.

2710 2018-02-20 21:17:02 World stocks mixed: US -.6%, Europe +.6%. Lots of volatility but almost a “normal” day in the US market. Investors were spoiled by straight-line early year market move. Unrealistic! 2018 still looks good but won’t be dull.
2711 2018-02-20 21:17:02 President Donald Trump says he's signed a memo directing the Justice Department to propose regulations to "ban all devices" like bump stocks used in last year's Las Vegas massacre.

2714 2018-02-20 21:16:41 @realDonaldTrump What if I told you the financial tools and tax codes you use for the security of your money were too effective and unfair? You'd scoff at me! But our guns are the very tools we choose to defend our nation and property! Don't you DARE come after our rifles/stocks!
2715 2018-02-20 21:16:40 Donald Trump has recommended a ban on bump stocks, a gun modification used in the Las Vegas massacre -- Sky News
2716 2018-02-20 21:16:38 Bump stocks had NOTHING to do with the #MarjoryStonemanDouglasHighSchool shooting! @PressSec dodged questions about any “original ideas” @realDonaldTrump might have to prevent school shootings!
2717 2018-02-20 21:16:38 Bump stocks is a bone. Shit even Lindsey Graham said he might vote to ban those. 

Sure ban them of course, but also ban the rifle that can use a bump stock.
2718 2018-02-20 21:16:37 WOW! fair play to Trump for moving to ban bump stocks. It's a step towards doing the right thing of a ban on all assault weapons
2719 2018-02-20 21:16:36 Nothing about an 18 yr old purchasing a semi-automatic weapon or Florida’s relaxed gun laws, bump stocks had nothing2do w/those priceless young souls #stonemandouglasshooting
2720 2018-02-20 21:16:35 It will be all he does, the NRA is OK with this because bump stocks are crappy anyway.  He won't cross the NRA.
2721 2018-02-20 21:16:30 U.S. stocks end lower, with Walmart weighing on Dow
2722 2018-02-20 21:16:29 I don't understand how these regulations can have any effect on the law as it is written. For any device to turn a semi-auto firearm into a fully automatic firearm, it needs to allow the trigger be pulled continuously. Bump stocks etc. don't do that.
2723 2018-02-20 21:16:28 #TuesdayThoughts
Trump directs the Justice Dept. to ban gun modifications like bump stocks...

Finally. Finally. FINALLY.
2724 2018-02-20 21:16:27 As Attorney Jeff Sessions is talking Trump and bump stocks...Slide Fire bumpfires are selling out at warp speed...
2725 2018-02-20 21:16:22 Trump could have cared less about this, but the 'respite' that WH thought Trump would get from the Florida shooting backfired. Student spoke up and brought national attention to #GunReformNow. Out of desperation, Trump takes on bump stocks which threatens the NRA the least.
2726 2018-02-20 21:16:21 President Trump @POTUS says he has directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to propose changes that would ban so-called bump stocks.
2727 2018-02-20 21:16:15 "Trump directs DOJ to ban gun mods like bump stocks" 

This is low hanging fruit. Trump coulda done this any moment since he took office. He's only doing it now cuz of #MarchForOurLives movement. 

Keep at it kids! You're making a difference! Don't stop now!
2728 2018-02-20 21:16:15 Trump just stated that he signed a memo to the AG asking him to look into banning bump stocks. Gee thank you mr trump, that does alot....signed a memo.....look into.
2729 2018-02-20 21:16:15 @Kenny26658812 study his free videos and get stocks to trade. I want to be a challenge student too but I also can't pay that right now either. I still had a green day today! The PDT rule is good too. It helps with discipline and overtrading. 3 great trades is all you need! Gdlck!
2730 2018-02-20 21:16:13 Could be the beginning of a long process, but soon the pendantic distinctions and mewling cries from the NRA will drag things to a halt and it becomes a cynical “we banned bump stocks and look how that turned out, gun control isn’t feasible, no point in trying”.
2731 2018-02-20 21:16:08 He’s so proud of his Executive Actions, why didn’t he sign one of those?  Oh yeah, because that would have required subsequent action against bump stocks.
2732 2018-02-20 21:16:07 Trump is #soangrywithrussia he is banning bump stocks in Syria..
2733 2018-02-20 21:16:02 but a review in december said under current law they cannot regulate or ban bujmp stocks...only congress can do something about it.
2734 2018-02-20 21:16:00 Trump says he has ordered AG Sessions to write regulations that ban bump stocks and related devices that transform semi-automatic firearms into automatics, per White House pool.
2735 2018-02-20 21:15:59 That is bump stocks, not full autos!

Full autos have been banned to be manufactured for the civilian market since May 19th, 1986.

#gunsense #2A #RKBA
2736 2018-02-20 21:15:59 Cheeto thinks talking about bump stocks will distract us from the mission to hold elected officials accountable for enacting sensible gun laws. There he goes thinking again.

2737 2018-02-20 21:15:56 Trump told ‘Deep State’ Operative Sessions to ban Bump stocks
2738 2018-02-20 21:15:50 What’s the point? Bump stocks are the most useless thing ever. There is nothing a bump stock can do that you can’t do with just holding the weapon differently
2739 2018-02-20 21:15:50 Actually, Trump directed AG Sessions to study the possibility of banning bump stocks
2740 2018-02-20 21:15:48 1. You mean a fully automatic gun not a machine gun. 
2. Bump stocks and other such devices speed up the rate of fire but its still a semi automatic not full auto.
2741 2018-02-20 21:15:43 Thank you @realDonaldTrump for banning bump stocks and “all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns “
2742 2018-02-20 21:15:42 After grinding the bump stocks down into a fine powder, is it more effective to smoke it or blow lines of it to build up my rage prior to smashing my television with a sledgehammer?
2743 2018-02-20 21:15:32 Bump stocks don't turn semiautomatics into machine guns.
2744 2018-02-20 21:15:32 So 4 months and 19 days after Vegas, the President finally offers to do something about bump stocks.

So on July 9, 2018 will he finally acknowledge and suggest doing something on assault rifles?

I’m taking the over.
2745 2018-02-20 21:15:30 First, an AR-15 is not an assault rifle. Assault styling, yes. Definition of assault rifle is one with a selectable fire option with one being automatic.(See Wikipedia)
Second, bump stocks do not turn semi-autos to full auto (I do agree with ban). They simply allow rapid cycling.
2746 2018-02-20 21:15:30 Of course you didn’t here the press briefing. Right? And trump has done more against Putin and Russia than Obama in 8 years. Right? And suddenly Trump has signed a memorandum not an executive order just to look into eliminating bum stocks. Yippee!

2748 2018-02-20 21:15:27 #Editorial: It sounds like President Trump is leaving final status determination of bump stocks and other gun modifications to AG Sessions. With any luck, Jeff will stop this move before it sets a terrible precedent for executive gun action. #2A #NRA #MAGA #KeepAndBearArms
2749 2018-02-20 21:15:27 In my earlier Tweet I stated Trump signed a bill stopping the sale of bump stocks. I was incorrect. He ordered Session & Co. to look into it. Sorry for the confusion, I should have known better to begin with.
2750 2018-02-20 21:15:27 Trumps memorandum on bump stocks is literally a nothing burger, pure distraction
2751 2018-02-20 21:15:21 Liberals: "Ban Machine Guns!"

2754 2018-02-20 21:15:13 News: President Trump has directed AG Jeff sessions to craft a regulation (!) effectively banning bump stocks, addressing the priority that arose after the Las Vegas shooting. He also said school safety is now one of the administration's top priorities
2755 2018-02-20 21:15:04 Stock $TTPH has just announced an exclusive agreement #pennyStocks #stocks #stockMarket #StockTrading #trader #News
2756 2018-02-20 21:15:03 Moving to ban bump stocks, however feasible under current law, is a welcome move by Trump.

But doing so *now*, and not after the Las Vegas shooting months ago, makes it seems politically expedient & desperate in order to shift attention away from latest shooting.
2757 2018-02-20 21:15:02 At an event at the @WhiteHouse Pres.Trump has said he just signed a directive ordering AG Jeff Sessions to craft regulations banning “bump stocks” and other devices that upgrade semi-automatic firearms; he said he wants the new federal guidelines “very soon”. @rtenews
2758 2018-02-20 21:15:01 To lil to late bump stocks didn't hill the kids!
2759 2018-02-20 21:15:00 Great points on bump stocks and that further discussion around the AR-15 on @jaketapper. Great to hear a conservative voice at the table with good ideas and talking points. Both sides need to come with the same attitude! @amandacarpenter
2760 2018-02-20 21:14:57 Bump stocks is not NRA or anything to do with 2A .
2761 2018-02-20 21:14:57 Guns Thought of The Day

I freely admit that I dont know what the best balance between allowing gun ownership while legislating it

What I do know

Tougher gun laws work
Mental Health is irrelevant in this discussion
Banning Bump Stocks is a meaningless gesture in this discussion
2762 2018-02-20 21:14:51 I believe bump stocks should be just as heavily regulated as automatic firearms are in the US.
2763 2018-02-20 21:14:48 oh, remember how they were going to ban the bump stocks or however it's spelled?  Yeah, that never happened.
2764 2018-02-20 21:14:46 Sounds like another Trump move where Trump recommends bump stocks get banned but Sessions says he doesn’t support a ban.
2765 2018-02-20 21:14:44 Trying to pick tops on stocks that are at ATHs is not an easy strategy. Channels work until stocks go parabolic. Have to stay disciplined. HOD is a hard stop IMHO. I prefer to see a lower high confirm or a reversal pattern before playing that game.
2766 2018-02-20 21:14:41 Ooooooh, a memo.  To possibly look into bump stocks.  Sounds incredibly promising (i.e., BS).
2767 2018-02-20 21:14:40 JUST IN: President Trump says he's directed Attorney General Sessions to propose regulations to ban "all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns” like bump stocks.

BREAKING: President Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks used in Las Vegas massacre.
2775 2018-02-20 21:14:24 It’s a lean bone - “bump stocks” aren’t the issue it’s the weapons they attach too
2776 2018-02-20 21:14:17 Banning Bump stocks is a good start @realdonaldtrump

But NOT ENOUGH

We demand:

Universal background checks
end of straw purchases
end of loopholes
NO gun sales to people who are known to be dangerous
@NRA money OUT of our government

I hope new smaller positions took today do justice to my portfolio. I’ll graciously take even half of what $WEED did today.
2778 2018-02-20 21:14:13 No more bump stocks ...

2781 2018-02-20 21:14:06 wow if trump actually bans bump stocks good on him for doing something.
2782 2018-02-20 21:14:05 he did not mention bump stocks..... devices that convert legal guns into machine guns are already against the law have been since the 30s BULLSHIT COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH @POTUS
2783 2018-02-20 21:14:04 Trump has ordered AG Sessions to ban bump stocks, which can turn a semi-automatic gun into a machine gun. Hoping that both sides can work together to continue enacting common-sense gun regulations.
2784 2018-02-20 21:14:02 #FL State Rep, 844-899-9394. #Senators, 844-899-8866.
Blls that FL leadership to tell them to work on:
HB 219/SB 196: An assault weapons ban.
SB 838: Universal background checks for all gun sales.
HB 321/SB 456: A ban on bump stocks, which allows semiautomatics to fire faster.
2785 2018-02-20 21:13:57 S/O to Trump for once for pushing the Justice Dept to ban bump stocks and other devices that help make firearms more deadly!
2786 2018-02-20 21:13:52 still in great territory, also it depends what kind of stocks you have which are still steady or going up
2787 2018-02-20 21:13:52 It's BWBA. Don't expect any RWS references. And any they do just acknowledge the existence of the people who despise these drastic changes the most. A spit in the face to us. If BWBA flops and many fans abandon the new seasons, those stocks are gonna show it.

2790 2018-02-20 21:13:43 Banning bump stocks is a start but not good enough. I hope this isn't - how to get away with doing bare minimum.
2791 2018-02-20 21:13:43 gun ppl doesn't give a flying fuck about bump stocks unless they're autismo af about "shall not be infringed".

they're pretty unreliable+expensive, but the left thinks they're murder factories on wheels. trump setting up for clean checkmate on guns issue

2795 2018-02-20 21:13:37 Well there it is. Who thought, the Fucking Republicans would put more restrictions on our 2A? Ridiculous, bump stocks don’t kill people at all, it’s an accessory, you minds well band the scope, rails, flashlight, bi-pod, sling, etc., get it.
2796 2018-02-20 21:13:26 Why didn't the past 4-5 administrations not ban it to begin with? Trump is the first to do anything about bump stocks.

2798 2018-02-20 21:13:23 ok, i maintain that trump meant he's taking steps to ban bump stocks, but my friend over here thinks he very carefully worded it to just "directly quote[ existing] laws and ATF regs". trump said: ..
2799 2018-02-20 21:13:22 WASHINGTON (AP) - President Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks used in Las Vegas massacre.
2800 2018-02-20 21:13:18 Trump and the NRA know that this will end up in court.

Legislation is needed for bump stocks. Everything you said plus strict regulation of gun ownership, including safety and security requirements.
2801 2018-02-20 21:13:18 Trump wanting regulations to ban bump stocks shows that he has no idea which side he's on. Can't wait for the gun nuts to respond to him. :)
2802 2018-02-20 21:13:18 It's something. And takes bump stocks away as a bargaining chip for CCW reciprocity which Republicans have promised their base and passed in the House. That's a big deal to me in CA, as we have strict scrutiny on those, so don't have many allowed.
2803 2018-02-20 21:13:18 Paddock shot 481 Americans using a bump stock modified weapon.

The ATF has spent 153 days (and counting) "reviewing" bump stocks.
2804 2018-02-20 21:13:11 @realDonaldTrump Your statement regarding banning bump stocks is a very bad decision, sir! We decide what tools we use to keep our homes and nation safe & no one tells us what we can or cannot employ to do that!
2805 2018-02-20 21:13:06 President Trump just awarded an number of Medals of Valor to some very brave men.
Liberals are furious that he didn't mention bump stocks or Russian bots during the presentation.
2806 2018-02-20 21:13:03 CNN
They're going to look into the banning of Bump Stocks,
not that they ARE GOING to ban them.

2808 2018-02-20 21:12:56 I’ll believe it when I see it. I can’t help but wonder: is he saying this because someone who wanted bump stocks banned was the last person he talked to before taking this stance? What will it be tomorrow?

2811 2018-02-20 21:12:39 Good. Glad to hear @realDonaldTrump  signed memo to take action on bump stocks. But 17 people died at Parkland without the shooter using a bump stock. 49 died at Pulse. This cannot be the only action he takes and then claim “I did more than Obama.” We need comprehensive reform.
2812 2018-02-20 21:12:35 Oh my God!  Did you hear?  Trump is instructing Sessions to propose regulations to ban bump stocks.  Do NOT you and your classmates stop the pressure!  They are hoping this is enough to make it all go away.
2813 2018-02-20 21:12:33 Bump stocks to be banned by regulatory action per Presidential memorandum. 
For or against, this is done minus legislative action.
2814 2018-02-20 21:12:32 Bump stocks banned. There you go, gun control. Next issue.

2817 2018-02-20 21:12:29 ban bump stocks after vegas? no. we'll wait for a while. for at least a few months anyway.
2818 2018-02-20 21:12:29 Thank you Trump. It’s time to ban bump stocks because automatic weapons should not be in hands of civilians and children. Get to work, Jeff Sessions.
2819 2018-02-20 21:12:28 Legislate control of assault & semi-automatic & automatic weapons then bump-stocks will no longer be an issue. Putting the cart before the horse.
2820 2018-02-20 21:12:26 Anyone curious as to how seriously we should take this news should do a general search on: (1) T & bump stocks, (2) recall how sweet he was last year about DACA “kids,” (3) filter this—& all he says & does—thru his narcissistic default mode.
2821 2018-02-20 21:12:26 Banning bump stocks not the answer...BAN ALL AUTOMATIC WEAPONS that are built only to kill people! Shooter didn't have bump stock but he still brutally murdered 17 people! Voters need to STOP voting 4 politicians who accept NRA blood money!!
2822 2018-02-20 21:12:25 So now trump wants a ban on bump stocks, geez how long ago was the murders in Las Vegas, and just now he is asking for something to get done, so in 50 years we will see something???
2823 2018-02-20 21:12:23 If Trump really just ordered the banning of bump stocks and other dangerous modifications to firearms I have to give the man credit. He did this right. #bumpstock #ParklandFlorida

2826 2018-02-20 21:12:18 I thought that conversion kits that truly change a weapon to full auto were already banned and illegal? Bump stocks were a way to get around this. Is he talking about bump stocks? That’s an incredibly watered down start to #CommonSenseGunLaws #endgunviolence
2827 2018-02-20 21:12:15 #ImWithTheKids Don't let them do this. Ban the weapon that bump stocks are used on. This alone would confirm everyone's right to have the military assault weapon.

2830 2018-02-20 21:12:10 #Discussion will not be enough! #ListeningSessions are not enough! #Action is needed! What a coincidence that just today, after so much time & so much backlash for his inactions, they will finally try to do something about bump stocks! #WeWillSee #TinyHands @realDonaldTrump

2839 2018-02-20 21:11:46 Bump stocks was last year's issue. In Las Vegas. The issue now is the access of weapons of mass murder by the mentally ill
2840 2018-02-20 21:11:45 @jaketapper trumps memorandum on bump stocks is nothing but glitter to distract from the real gun control issues, I hope nobody falls for this
2841 2018-02-20 21:11:42 Trump neglected bump stocks after Vegas and Ryan refused to bring legislation to the floor. Looks like the republican strategy now is to give up an easy one and say they did something on gun safety.
2842 2018-02-20 21:11:40 It's actually quite progressive.  Every transaction is taxed including securities (stocks, assets, etc.). Total annual income is $16 trillion. Total transactions is $5000 trillion. A 0.2% tax would yield $10 trillion. A $50k salary would pay only $100 in tax.
2843 2018-02-20 21:11:31 According to video posted on Marco Rubio’s twitter “ATR has ability to ban bump stocks” immediately. Nothing needs to be voted on.

2851 2018-02-20 21:11:11 So, POTUS is going to ban so-called bump stocks. What is next? The Constitution and A2 under attack by the MSM and our oppressive government. Is POTUS turning his back on Patriots?
2852 2018-02-20 21:11:09 Somebody probably slipped it in somewhere, he saw the words "bump stocks", assumed it had something to do with the stock market and finding a way to make more money for his already rich white friends and signed off on it without reading.
2853 2018-02-20 21:11:06 Bump stocks are illegal now so you cant legally go make a semi auto go fully auto by accessories at a store
2854 2018-02-20 21:11:05 Such bullshit.  This is a delay tactic just like the NRA pretending to be open to restricting bump stocks after LV.  They do it to try take the momentum away from the real movement and then do nothing.
2855 2018-02-20 21:11:04 "President Trump directs Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ban "bump stocks". 

30 million dollars in campaign contributions down the drain.
2856 2018-02-20 21:10:56 Here comes the ban on bump stocks. I shot an AK with a bump stock this wknd. Not practical or anything Id waste my money on. Ban away
2857 2018-02-20 21:10:55 Shhh, it’s just bump stocks. Let the left call it a victory and move on. What they don’t understand is you can do the same thing that a bump stick does with your thumb and a belt loop
2858 2018-02-20 21:10:54 Someone needs to let Trump know that things like bump stocks will never be controlled as they can be made from parts laying around the house in 5 minutes.
2859 2018-02-20 21:10:52 Bump stocks are but a tiny part of our gun problem. Trump is trying to take the smallest problem of our gun culture "to fix" so he can say he did something. And, Sarah just lies and lies from our white house. We need a lot more than just to ban bump stocks.
2860 2018-02-20 21:10:47 @realDonaldTrump If you’re going to ban bump stocks use the exact ATF description that was approved for sale, so your actions cannot metastasize.

2868 2018-02-20 21:10:27 banning bump stocks is good. it's also an admission that stricter gun laws can save lives.

now that we've conceded that point, let's ban assault weapons & high-capacity magazines.
2869 2018-02-20 21:10:25 Yup. Bump stocks produced bya small company without juice with the NRA, which caters to the large corporate gun makers.
2870 2018-02-20 21:10:25 Tell me why bump stocks are needed?
2871 2018-02-20 21:10:22 The ATF was already in the process of making Bump Stocks illegal.
2872 2018-02-20 21:10:21 Bum stocks have nothing to do with the Florida argument!!!  Stricter gun laws have nothing to do with it. Don’t forget Trump overturned gun regulations on the mentality I’ll.
2873 2018-02-20 21:10:21 You shouldn’t own common stocks if a 50% decrease in their value in a short period of time would cause you acute distress
2874 2018-02-20 21:10:18 @thehill @thedailybeast Amazing how quickly Trump came out with mandate on bump stocks only after teens in Florida started national #neveragain campaign! Nice try Trump but we see through your motives!

2883 2018-02-20 21:10:07 Yeah, there were a few issues with it. Turns out it's hard to define "bump stocks" without including tools for disabled people.
2884 2018-02-20 21:10:05 Bump stocks are made easily. This is not a fix
2885 2018-02-20 21:10:04 Trump knows that there were no bump stocks used in Florida.... right?

2890 2018-02-20 21:09:43 WHAT ABOUT AR-15's???? BUMP STOCKS WERE SO TWO MASS SHOOTINGS AGO.
2891 2018-02-20 21:09:38 Although outlawing bump stocks/devices which allow fully-automatic conversion of firearms is a first step, I believe it is a half-measure. We must ban all firearms besides low-capacity handguns (home defense) and single-shot rifles (hunting), and require mental health checks.
2892 2018-02-20 21:09:34 Honest question...but it will still be legal to purchase an actual machine gun?  This is just a ban on bump stocks?
2893 2018-02-20 21:09:33 That's it?!?!?! RT @AP: BREAKING: President Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks used in Las Vegas massacre.
2894 2018-02-20 21:09:31 he has no heart and is a sociopathic narcissist but even if he actually goes through with banning bump stocks simply for political expediency well what the fuck just take it.
2895 2018-02-20 21:09:31 What do you think of the President’s plan to largely ban bump stocks? Do you agree with the move? @DenverChannel

2898 2018-02-20 21:09:21 Most of the quality stocks are 10-20% lower from thr highs... But looking at current market conditions we ll get them cheaper
2899 2018-02-20 21:09:20 Trump wants to ban bump stocks?  Does he experience time at one thirds speed?  That was the Vegas massacre.  Bump stock wasn’t even used in Parkland.  This is a bullshit “get them to shut up by doing something barely needed vs doing something significant.”
2900 2018-02-20 21:09:20 So, in other words, nothing. The law already does this, and bump stocks technically don't make a weapon an automatic.
2901 2018-02-20 21:09:07 All this new tax plan by your party is just delaying the inevitable. Our taxes will go up! Yet you just rubber stamp everything put in front of you by your party.BTW, vote against bump stocks ,if it comes up. It probably won't though because you are bribed by the NRA.
2902 2018-02-20 21:09:07 The NRA supports banning bump stocks, it's clearly not enough.
2903 2018-02-20 21:09:05 Predictable.  Regulating bump stocks is the path of least resistance and will allow DJT to crow about how much he has done (not). NRA heads likely told him they would comply - all in an effort to quell the current outrage on lack of action.
2904 2018-02-20 21:09:05 I'm fine with this. Bump stocks are not needed.
2905 2018-02-20 21:09:03 Trump just announced he has signed a memo directing AG Sessions to develop regulations banning bump stocks and "all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns."
2906 2018-02-20 21:09:03 Drumpf and his Russian/NRA masters will give him bump stocks to appease those who are outraged by the massacres. Take it and demand a WHOLE lot more!
2907 2018-02-20 21:09:00 President Donald Trump has directed the US Justice Department to ban gun modifications such as the bump stocks used in the Las Vegas massacre.

2910 2018-02-20 21:08:51 White House press sect Sanders says policy review on "bump stocks," used in Vegas shooting, is complete and Trump may act to restrict. "The president supports not having bump stocks"
2911 2018-02-20 21:08:51 The AP is reporting that 45 has issued a directive to DOJ to ban bump stocks. How many people have been killed by people wielding assault weapons since Las Vegas? And now they're trying to redirect the conversation to bump stocks?

No. 

No way. 

#BanAssaultWeapons #GunReformNow
2912 2018-02-20 21:08:50 He just aid back in December he ordered Jeff Sessions to study bump stocks. #ICallBS You know damned good and well we would've heard that before today if it had happened.
2913 2018-02-20 21:08:48 Zero empathy if it doesn't affect him personally.     Banning bump stocks is his solution to the problem?  It's not good enough.  #MarchForOurLives
2914 2018-02-20 21:08:44 So trump/gop is going to try & appease the Parkside survivors by pushing for the ban of bump stocks. The very least thing that they can humanly do & something the NRA supports. I know these kids are too smart to fall for it. #GunSenseNow
2915 2018-02-20 21:08:42 Since the NRA supports banning bump stocks, it's clearly not enough.
2916 2018-02-20 21:08:40 Do they have bump stocks, Kevlar piercing bullets and AR 15’s? MP’s at a military base have glocks. Why do you need military style weapons to protect yourself?
2917 2018-02-20 21:08:39 Maybe there was better gun control methods, bump-stocks wouldn't be such a high priority, or even an issue. Waste of time banning bumps. It's what they are attached to & who is using them, that is the problem.
2918 2018-02-20 21:08:37 That whole coordination between the press conference & Trump's announcement on bump stocks (even the NRA agree so it's not really gun-control ) was so clunky & sounds like his teeth are about to fall out. I'm mad. Still won't say Putin. Mother f*****. #Trumpcollusion
2919 2018-02-20 21:08:36 #BREAKING: (@AP) President Trump directs Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks used in Las Vegas massacre.
2920 2018-02-20 21:08:30 Trump said today that he is looking to ban bump stocks and other devices that turn normal guns into machine guns. That issue is like 7 mass shootings ago
2921 2018-02-20 21:08:29 Why the obsession w/DOW is nuts. Any company, like W-Mart today, can move it so much up/down. Meanwhile, we, the folks, w/various stocks are not affected by this.
2922 2018-02-20 21:08:29 NBC reports: “BREAKING: President Trump says he’s directed AG Sessions to clarify if bump stocks are illegal and to propose regulations to “ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns.”
2923 2018-02-20 21:08:28 #Breaking : @potus directs #DOJ to ban Gun modifications like Bump Stocks used in #LasVegasShooting .  This, as #Florida Legislators vote DOWN attempt to revive a bill to ban assault rifles.
2924 2018-02-20 21:08:23 @MSignorile So trump must've gone to the nra and said, "you have to give me something on guns" and they came back and said "bump stocks" BOTH PIECES OF SHIT.  This won't stop the gun violence!
2925 2018-02-20 21:08:22 NEW: President Trump says he signed memo directing AG Sessions to craft regulations banning bump stocks.
2926 2018-02-20 21:08:22 Bump stocks are their token concession to seem reasonable without changing the underlying reality of gun violence. Even if bump stocks are banned, you haven't eliminated the problem, you've just lessened the body count.
2927 2018-02-20 21:08:20 Important question: does HE know he asked DOJ to ban bump stocks?
2928 2018-02-20 21:08:19 The Trumpanzees are going to be angry that their messiah is taking away their bump stocks. #TrumpColluded

2930 2018-02-20 21:08:12 Trump bans bump stocks, thank God because anyone in the industry knows those things are garbage.
2931 2018-02-20 21:08:11 Bump stocks can be dealt with by ATF regulation, this isnt complicated.
2932 2018-02-20 21:08:09 Just bump stocks is a dangling carrot ....
2933 2018-02-20 21:08:07 President Donald Trump says he has signed a memorandum directing the U.S. Justice Department to ban gun modifications such as the 'bump stocks' used in the Las Vegas shooting last October
2934 2018-02-20 21:08:05 FIVE MONTHS LATER he's just now looking at this. If he thinks outlawing bump stocks is going to appease people who are demanding to know why military rifles should be available to civilians, think again.
2935 2018-02-20 21:08:05 And now AP released that Trump want Bump stocks banned?
2936 2018-02-20 21:08:01 I wouldn’t hold my breath.  Bump stocks were conceded by the NRA after the Vegas shooting.
2937 2018-02-20 21:08:00 I still despise the orange menace. Banning bump stocks is a very very small step to take. But it’s a good one. Much much much more needs doing that the WH refuses to see.
2938 2018-02-20 21:07:58 SHS is an embarrassment. The entire briefing is one lie after another. Bump Stocks bad but massacre gun, AR15, good. The NRA says good boy. Let's see action! Real action with real results. #MarchForOurLives #NeverAgainMSD

2941 2018-02-20 21:07:50 Those who want bump stocks can declare them undocumented rifle devices and their homes as Sanctuary Houses for them, right? I mean...change the words and breaking the law becomes cool.
2942 2018-02-20 21:07:49 I can’t deny that it’s a step in the right direction that Donald Trump wants to make bump stocks illegal. 

Now can he impose a mental health check before issuing a gun? #Parkland
2943 2018-02-20 21:07:42 He's throwing people a bone so he can later say. HEY I was SO tough on guns. I passed a big beautiful bill banning bump stocks. More than Obama did. SAD! Hopefully this is just the start, but Trump is #1 on the list for money taken from the NRA..so I won't hold my breath.

2952 2018-02-20 21:07:19 @TheLeadCNN So it took 17 more lives after all those mass shootings just to talk about bump stocks again. Where was he from the beginning of this presidency. I'm beyond using the word despicable. Its more like dereliction toward this country's citizens.
2953 2018-02-20 21:07:18 At issue we don’t know yet if Mr Trump actually outlawed bump stocks or if just a memorandum to look into outlawing bump stocks.

2955 2018-02-20 21:07:16 Does the NRA make money off bump stocks?  They probably lose money from them.  How soon till tRump pats himself on the back for this one?  This was a clever way to do something with out really doing shit.
2956 2018-02-20 21:07:16 ATF and DOJ have said in the past, even under Obama, that they did not have the authority to regulate Bump Stocks.

The point of this is to get positive headlines, and sadly the media is dumb enough to blindly follow along.
2957 2018-02-20 21:07:12 Oh yeah...a memo will work....a memo is NOT legislature making "bump stocks" illegal!!!!  A memo is a facade...making Americans believe that something is being done...when in fact NOTHING is being done!!!!
2958 2018-02-20 21:07:06 Didn't we say we were going to ban bump stocks immediately following the Vegas shooting and then wait until everyone forgot about that claim to do nothing? Bump stocks should be banned and it's a good start but that doesn't go nearly far enough.
2959 2018-02-20 21:07:02 Really? Bump stocks?
2960 2018-02-20 21:07:01 Trump has banned bump stocks, what did Obama ever do. Obama may have been great at soundbites but did fuck all as President. #8Years
2961 2018-02-20 21:07:00 And outlawing bump stocks would not have prevented any of the gun related mass murders and might have reduced the fire volume in, what, one of the shootings.  Yeah, that’ll do it.... I’m glad Trump is taking such an aggressive stance against killing our children.
2962 2018-02-20 21:06:58 Ok just dumb. Only law abiding citizens follow laws. Criminals will buy bump stocks on the black market anyway. This law will do nothing. Absolutely nothing.
2963 2018-02-20 21:06:54 Trump says to ban bump stocks, media says it is all for show... 

What an unpredictable turn of events...
2964 2018-02-20 21:06:49 Also, why does the President have to direct the AG to draft proposed legislation banning bump stocks? Isn't that Congress's job?
2965 2018-02-20 21:06:48 #DonaldTrump directs AG to *propose* regulations to ban bump stocks. That word 'propose' means, IMO, that it will happen...maybe by 2028.
2966 2018-02-20 21:06:47 I hope that they can get bump stocks banned. Even the most hardcore gun nuts/2A enthusiasts I know are like, “ew no, fuck those things.”
2967 2018-02-20 21:06:47 Sadly for the families mourning the loss of their children from the shooting in Florida trump did nothing after the Vegas and Texas mass shootings. Today trump wants to ban bump stocks. That had nothing to do with the Florida shooting

2974 2018-02-20 21:06:30 @realDonaldTrump  UR pure evil. You took months to recommend banning bump stocks. Had to wait to get the official NRA permission? BTW-When are you going to punish Russia? What the hell RU waiting for? We can’t “get on with our lives” until Russia is sanctioned. #TrumpIsATraitor

2981 2018-02-20 21:06:18 President Trump says he has "signed a memorandum directing the attorney general to propose regulations to ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns." ATF is in the midst of a rulemaking process on bump stocks. A bump stock was used in the Las Vegas shooting.

2999 2018-02-20 21:05:28 FBI may have stood down on all of these shootings. Congress let the assult rifle ban expire in 1994, then allowed high capasity magazines, then obama legalized bump stocks. They new these would weapons of choice for killers & easy to get. Using this plan to take all guns.
3000 2018-02-20 21:05:21 He didn’t. They’re just trying to make it look like they’re doing something on guns. Plus, the NRA supports regulating bump stocks.

3006 2018-02-20 21:05:12 The last president had an opportunity to remove bump stocks and chose not to.  This president is eliminating them.  Confused by your misplaced angst
3007 2018-02-20 21:05:12 Trump your attempt to show empathy for the victims in parkland is pathetic. Your idea that restrictions on bump stocks will is dillusional anything short of banning guns in public and sale is misguided and mental illness is not the reason for these murders.

3011 2018-02-20 21:04:55 So now,  Trump is saying he has directed AG to ban bump stocks. In the meantime , gun access by the mentally ill,  and lack of an assault weapons ban is still the NRA toadies ' position. Take with one hand,  give twice as much with the other.
3012 2018-02-20 21:04:52 The memo wasn't to actually ban bump stocks - it was directing Sessions into looking at what can be done.
3013 2018-02-20 21:04:52 The justice Department has also said that it can’t ban bump stocks it doesn’t have that authority so

More to come...
3041 2018-02-20 21:04:02 @realDonaldTrump The end to bump stocks should have happened already. The NRA was willing to concede. This is nothing but another distraction from Russia and the Student movement. You are still lying about sanctions! DO SOMETHING REAL!
3042 2018-02-20 21:04:02 "we'll see what happens. Many good people....& I say that, & many ppl are saying that, & believe me, that I can tell you. But, we're looking into it, we have some very good ppl, believe me, that I can tell you. Bump stocks, we'll see what happens. Hillary, Benghazi 33,000 emails"

3044 2018-02-20 21:03:57 Why does D. Trump always sound so fake when announcing a new or renewed proposition!  Just now speaking on banning bump stocks was so fake or insincere sounding!
3045 2018-02-20 21:03:57 #BREAKING: President Trump says he has signed a memorandum directing the Justice Department to ban gun modifications like bump stocks used in Las Vegas massacre.
3046 2018-02-20 21:03:57 Trump now saying, he wants to ban bump stocks and protect children is a little too late & a lie.
3047 2018-02-20 21:03:57 Especially since DOJ and the ATF have already said they don't have the authority to regulate Bump Stocks.
3048 2018-02-20 21:03:56 So Trump “took action” today by asking his AG to ban the sale of bump stocks, used to turn semi-automatic weapons to automatic. 
This action really won’t change anything.
Banning assault weapons would.
3049 2018-02-20 21:03:54 The NRA will die a slow death after Mueller proves the Russians laundered money thru the NRA 4 Trump. Trump gives the kids bump stocks ban. Not enough TRUMP!
3050 2018-02-20 21:03:52 At the medal of honor ceremony, @potus has announced that he has signed a memo to PROPOSE the ban of bump stocks. Not sure why it took so long after the #VegasShooting & why it's just a proposal. This is shamefully inadequate.
3051 2018-02-20 21:03:52 @kwelkernbc Do you find it interesting that the "study" about Bump Stocks hasn't been mentioned since Las Vegas and suddenly when the heat is on Trump, the report suddenly comes through for action? Love to know the truth of the time line on this.
3052 2018-02-20 21:03:52 The enabling and irrational right let's mentally ill children have AR15 100 rd clips and bump stocks because they refuse any GUN REFORM which is truly insane.
3053 2018-02-20 21:03:48 The president just banned bump stocks!!!!!
3054 2018-02-20 21:03:44 When they broke in with Drump talking about bump stocks a few minutes ago, it was obvious someone slipped some lithium in his diet coke today.
3055 2018-02-20 21:03:43 President Trump says that he has signed a memo directing the Department of Justice to develop regulations to ban bump stocks.
3056 2018-02-20 21:03:43 Bump-stocks allow semi-automatic rifles to fire at a high rate, similar to a machine gun, but can be bought without the extensive background checks required when purchasing automatic weapons.
3057 2018-02-20 21:03:40 Why do people buy bump stocks if it's so easy to do with a belt loop?
3058 2018-02-20 21:03:40 So , he signed a memo that will maybe look into proposing possibly banning bump stocks. They should’ve been banned six months ago. #FuckTrump #AssaultWeaponsBan
3059 2018-02-20 21:03:39 Trump signs (probably meaningless) memorandum to ban bump stocks that convert semi-automatic weapons into automatic. 

This is likely to become both Administration and GOP talking point on Florida shooting. LOOK WHAT WE DID. Whether enacted or not.

3066 2018-02-20 21:03:33 He is only banning stocks and modifying background checks because. 1. NRA wanted to ban bumpstocks and background checks 2. He wants to do  something Obama didn’t do. 3. Teens will soon vote.#We’reNotStupidStupid!
3067 2018-02-20 21:03:18 I thought @POTUS stated a “memorandum”  for Justice Dept. to begin looking into ban of bump stocks?
3068 2018-02-20 21:03:18 Probably would include them -- bump stocks were approved under the Obama administration.

3070 2018-02-20 21:03:16 This has come up before. DOJ and ATF has said before that they don't have the authority to regulate Bump Stocks.

This is literally just a stalling tactic designed to get positive headlines.
3071 2018-02-20 21:03:15 Banning bump stocks is a great start, but it’s not enough.
3072 2018-02-20 21:03:14 Just because you signed a order to ban Bump stocks doesn't mean that it will help with school shootings you will have to do a hell of a lot more than that to even get started.@realDonaldTrump

3077 2018-02-20 21:03:10 .@realDonaldTrump bump stocks are a small start. How about you get to banning assault type weapons AR15s. They are the weapon of choice for these mass murderers. BAN THEM NOW!! #neveragain

3081 2018-02-20 21:03:07 @realDonaldTrump didn’t sign anything definitive about “bump stocks”, just a useless memo saying he supports a ban #illegitimatepotus #donthecon #resistance #floridashooting
3082 2018-02-20 21:03:03 Bump Stocks will not be enough,  just trying to quiet the uproar and shut the teens outcry and outrage down.  #WeCallB.S.

This is what's called "throwing a bone."
It will be a big nothing.

3090 2018-02-20 21:02:48 @realDonaldTrump Bump Stocks do not solve the problem! The $31 Million you received from the NRA is enough to buy back every military weapon in  hands of Civilians!  Outlaw Military Grade Weapons ownership by Civilians! Anything less, & don’t you dare talk about protecting kids!
3091 2018-02-20 21:02:47 @realDonaldTrump 
Bump stocks, thats it?
What a limp dick tiny hands thing to do.
Tell that to Emma Gonzalez
3092 2018-02-20 21:02:38 I just saw trump on TV bragging about telling Sessions to draft regulations on bump stocks. He can now claim that he did something. But while bump stocks are part of the issue, they are not nearly the whole problem. It is like offering someone who just got shot a band aid.
3093 2018-02-20 21:02:38 From pool:  "President Trump announced he just signed a directive ordering Attorney General Jeff Sessions to craft regulations banning “bump stocks” and other devices that turn semi-automatic firearms into automatic weapons."

3099 2018-02-20 21:02:20 So if now we're banning bump stocks, does that mean after the next mass shooting we'll raise the age to purchase AR-15s to 21?
3100 2018-02-20 21:02:19 @realDonaldTrump 
Bump stocks had absolutely nothing to do with #Parkland mass murder. Shooter didn’t need a damn bump stock- he had an AR 15.
3101 2018-02-20 21:02:18 What I heard was that the US Attorney General didn’t say bump stocks are illegal under current law. And that Trump signed a memo that says maybe they should be.

Memos don’t have the force of law. Nothing to see here, folks.
3102 2018-02-20 21:02:17 So I guess now it's "Guns don't kill people, people kill people. Bump stocks have some kind of impact. So maybe there's value in managing access to the inanimate object regardless of meaningless catchphrases. But not guns. Obviously not guns. Bump stocks. We'll do that."
3103 2018-02-20 21:02:17 It's a small pleasure, but right now I'm thinking about the human dildos who invented and then built a business upon bump stocks. I'd bet anything they all voted for Trump.
3104 2018-02-20 21:02:16 So @POTUS claims that he signed a memorandum that will make bump stocks illegal, which has to go through the legislative process and can take months. Why don’t you address the REAL problem, which is the guns that the bump stocks attach to? 
Answer: because the @NRA owns you! SAD!
3105 2018-02-20 21:02:15 I hope so! Who supports “bump stocks”?!
3106 2018-02-20 21:02:11 President Trump has just directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to propose a regulation to ban bump stocks.

3108 2018-02-20 21:02:10 Lol "further action" you mean the thing that should have been passed 3 months ago? THAT bill on bump stocks that was introduced after Vegas?
3109 2018-02-20 21:02:10 Trump has ordered the Attorney General to take measures to ban bump stocks.
3110 2018-02-20 21:02:09 Most states already have waiting period. Wouldn't have affected Parkland tragedy. 
Bump stocks are a ridiculous gimmick. Wouldn't have helped Parkland tragedy. 
There is no gun show loophole. It's propaganda. Wouldn't have helped Parkland tragedy. Shooter passed BG check

3119 2018-02-20 21:01:53 If your "research" is watching Cramer, then it's definitely NOT OKAY.  If I were you, I'd risk 5% (at most) on individual stocks and then keep track of how your picks are doing compared to the market (including trading fees).  You'll probably find it's not as easy as you think.
3120 2018-02-20 21:01:52 Regulating bump stocks does not solve the problem of civilians owning AR-15s and using them to carry put mass killings #NotEnough #2Little2Late
3121 2018-02-20 21:01:52 Breaking: Per Trump, he signed a memorandum on banning bump stocks. This doesn't men it will happen, ball is now passed to Jeff Sessions.
3122 2018-02-20 21:01:47 A MEMORANDUM... DIRECTING Jeff Sessions.... to PROPOSE regulations.... on banning bump stocks.... so, thoughts and prayers 
3123 2018-02-20 21:01:44 So NRA sponsored @realDonaldTrump signed a memo specifying that they will look, maybe, into bump stocks.
3124 2018-02-20 21:01:42 My gag reflex is working overtime. 1st Sarah Sanders lies at the press podium, then Trump speaks on bump stocks. Vomit.
3125 2018-02-20 21:01:38 Trump on bump stocks: "Just a few moments ago, I signed a memorandum directing the Attorney General to propose regulations to ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns. I expect that these critical regulations will be finalized, Jeff, very soon."

3128 2018-02-20 21:01:33 @Emma4Change - Trump just announced a focus on bump-stocks. IMHO, were it not for the work of you and your classmates, he would not have done that. Keep up the pressure. #NeverAgain
3129 2018-02-20 21:01:32 Exactly. Because banning all Muslims is easier than halting the sale of AR-15 type guns or bump stocks.  I hate this admin.

3179 2018-02-20 21:00:38 @realDonaldTrump Teleprompter Trump is now on the Television, reading a prepared statement and surrounding himself with law enforcement about banning bump stocks...    He has a memorandum now making them illegal..
3180 2018-02-20 21:00:36 Trump EO should have happened months ago. Also means he has no plan to ban assault weapons as then bump stocks would be irrelevant.

Good start. Good for him.
3184 2018-02-20 21:00:31 President Trump announced he just signed a directive ordering Attorney General Jeff Sessions to craft regulations banning “bump stocks” and other devices that turn semi-automatic firearms into automatic weapons.

3188 2018-02-20 21:00:27 Drumpf claims they have investigating since December whether bump stocks are legal. That takes two months?
3189 2018-02-20 21:00:26 The President reading his remarks about bump stocks off the teleprompter is creepy AF. He is slurring his words and IMO seems medicated.
3190 2018-02-20 21:00:25 @realDonaldTrump is banning bump stocks only now because he knows our children are coming after him. He scurrying to get things done because he's afraid to lose support of his base. @MSNBC #MarchForOurLives #NeverAgain

3195 2018-02-20 21:00:21 Banning bump stocks is a first move and I’ll give Trump props for calling for this ban. NRA already approved this for him. One more step. Ban assault weapons like AR-15 and call for more sensible rules. #GunReformNow #NeverAgain #ThrowThemOut
3196 2018-02-20 21:00:20 Trump's specific words on bump stocks: "Just a few moments ago, I signed a memorandum directing the Attorney General to propose regulations to ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns.

3199 2018-02-20 21:00:19 It's great for shareholders... that hold those stocks. So
3200 2018-02-20 21:00:19 Trump directs a memorandum about bump stocks as if its a monumental concession on the part of the gun lobby.
3201 2018-02-20 21:00:18 Could #tRump read his speech in more of a monotone? The creep is clearly somewhat sedated. Glad he’s finally taking action against bump stocks though.
3202 2018-02-20 21:00:17 @realDonaldTrump. Could you speak any more monotone about bump stocks?  That’s how we can tell you are not sincere. You do not care!
3203 2018-02-20 21:00:16 While I appreciate Trump calling for banning bump stocks, it’s too little,too late. Should have done this after Vegas.
3204 2018-02-20 21:00:15 Bump stocks are not enough.
3205 2018-02-20 21:00:14 Trump to target bump stocks (from Vegas massacre) after Parkland shooting. Next: Bombing Japan due to Russian hacking. #makeamericagrateagain
3206 2018-02-20 21:00:14 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @GOP  I am listening to you right know and for once it pleases me that you are asking for bump stocks devices be banned.  I hope this is done fairly soon, I mean within a couple of weeks. It has been too long since it was supposed to be done after Vegas.
3207 2018-02-20 21:00:13 I'm assuming the NRA doesn't make any money off of bump stocks. In fact, they probably lose money due to them. 

Either way, they need to be outlawed along with the products benefiting the NRA
3208 2018-02-20 21:00:12 Very few people use bump stocks, so that's not a solution. Ban AR-15's or any variation of such weapons - that is a solution. Increased federal background checks do very little to keep guns away from crazy people, so ban them.
3209 2018-02-20 21:00:12 Obama directed the ATF to outlaw Bump Stocks. ATF stated under current law they could not. Trump doing a memorandum does NOTHING. There has to be a law passed. The NRA DOES NOT WANT A NEW LAW PASSED. This is an NRA PLOY.

3216 2018-02-20 21:00:05 Doing good as you got trumps attention to do something. Outlawing bump stocks which paralyzed my son at Route 91 concert
3217 2018-02-20 21:00:04 Trump now has ordered for a review of bump stocks. OK, now get rid of them, too, before the NRA tells you the opposite
3218 2018-02-20 21:00:04 in all seriousness if you limit all guns to say a 5 round capacity this will almost never happen again, and yes bump stocks are a no no for sure

3326 2018-02-20 20:57:03 .@POTUS just revealed he signed a memo "moments ago" ordering the DOJ to draft regulations to ban devices that "turn legal weapons into machine guns" (bump stocks), @devindwyer reports for @ABC.
3327 2018-02-20 20:56:50 President Trump says he has ordered Attorney General to propose rules outlawing the sale of devices -- such as bump stocks -- "that turn legal weapons into machine guns." #ParklandSchoolShooting
3328 2018-02-20 20:56:43 How about also making assault weapons illegal again; only in Vegas did we hear of bump stocks, while assault weapons like the AR-15 are the mass shooter’s weapon of choice with no bump stocks involved.
3329 2018-02-20 20:56:36 POTUS has his chance on bump stocks after Las Vegas and he didn't. #FakeNews #FakePresidentFacts #president #neveragain
3330 2018-02-20 20:56:32 I don't watch a whole lot of these, I'm trying to change that and stay updated. Something seems really off though with the questions in the briefing. The President DOESN'T believe in attachment bump stocks for rifles. Did I hear that right? #PressBriefing
3331 2018-02-20 20:56:24 Might as well delete these socials & just keep trading stocks & currency ...
3332 2018-02-20 20:56:21 Speaking at Public Safety Medal of Valor ceremonies, Trump speaks of Parkland, Florida shooting and announced memo to AG Sessions looking to ban bump stocks.

Also says focus will be, "common sense security measures and addressing mental health issues"
3333 2018-02-20 20:56:07 Bump stocks are illegal in Massachusetts, as of this month I think.
3334 2018-02-20 20:56:04 5 (business) day waiting period on all semi auto gun purchases 

Bye bye gun show loop hole 

Bye bye bump stocks or all modifications to semi auto weapons to turn them into (basically) fully auto weapons
3335 2018-02-20 20:55:59 TRUMP SAYS HE HAS SIGNED A MEMORANDUM RECOMMENDING THAT BUMP STOCKS LIKE THOSE USED IN LAS VEGAS SHOOTING BE DECLARED ILLEGAL: RTRS
3336 2018-02-20 20:55:53 Bump stocks were over 4 months ago. Progress? Zero.
3337 2018-02-20 20:55:52 Ironic that the people who like using knives on children have a problem with bump stocks.
3338 2018-02-20 20:55:42 What there going to ban bump stocks now. To quiet everyone down. That's a very small start. But they won't be quieted and either will we.
3339 2018-02-20 20:55:31 Optimistic after WH presser @PressSec - just need @POTUS to follow thru.  bump stocks.  Better background checks.   assault weapons
3340 2018-02-20 20:55:30 Exactly! As long as you haven’t been born yet, they care about you.  Once you’re out, starve, get shot. No matter what happens to the mother, either. 
What has this state done to keep assault weapons and bump stocks out of the hands of mentally ill and domestic abusers?
3341 2018-02-20 20:55:27 New: Trump just said he signed a memo directing the Attorney General to propose a rule outlawing bump stocks, all devices "that turn legal weapons into machine guns." He expects those regulations to be finalized "very soon."
3342 2018-02-20 20:55:23 @PressSec would not state definitively @realDonaldTrump does not support bump-stocks because he is mtv with CPAC that is $$$ from @NRA . He will not come out and call for ban on bump-stocks, or any weapon of war, I guarantee it. The @NRA is on the phone and I'm his ear right now.
3343 2018-02-20 20:55:23 This is incredibly brave of him 4+ months after Vegas when everyone has since bought all of the bump stocks.
3344 2018-02-20 20:55:15 Gun control action coming? Sanders says Trump doesn't support use of "bump stocks", expect action within days. Significant.
3345 2018-02-20 20:54:46 Stop praying and ban ar15 and bump stocks. Duh
3346 2018-02-20 20:54:44 Since we will already be holding an important election this year why not hold a Referendum on; 
1. Mandatory Universal Background checks.
2. 10 day waiting period.
3. Ban on assault rifles, large capacity magazines, bump stocks.
4. Mandatory liability insurance for gun owners.

3350 2018-02-20 20:54:08 So get out there now and grab all the bump stocks you can- I am sure you can mark them up and sell at Gun Shows, Bubba.
3351 2018-02-20 20:54:00 Rep. Finchem opposing @DrRandyFriese motion to have an immediate vote to ban bump stocks #HB2023 says we must get to the "heart of the problem" which he says are violent video games.
3352 2018-02-20 20:53:54 The Press even @johnrobertsFox and @ShepNewsTeam are again lying about bump stocks saying it allows you to turn the AR into an Automatic weapon.. 

STOP LYING TO THE UNEDUCATED AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT RELY ON YOU FOR NEWS! 

you’re blatantly lying both of you!
3353 2018-02-20 20:53:47 Sarah Sanders says during press briefing that @realdonaldtrump will address bump stocks. @SenFeinstein already tried to submit a bill to ban bump stocks and Mitch McConnell would not take it up.
3354 2018-02-20 20:53:39 WHITE HOUSE SAYS AGE RESTRICTIONS ON OWNING AR-15 "CERTAINLY ON THE TABLE" AFTER FLORIDA SCHOOL SHOOTING-WHITE HOUSE SAYS TRUMP SUPPORTS OUTLAWING BUMP STOCKS, EXPECT FURTHER ACTION IN COMING DAYS
3355 2018-02-20 20:53:30 Why aren't you buying more?
3356 2018-02-20 20:52:53 This means that Liberals will now be against banning bump stocks.

This conclusion based on every decision that Liberals have made since Trump became president...
3357 2018-02-20 20:52:40 Note that the DOW stocks are being shorted. Look at Wal-Mart, Disney and Visa. I bet on Soros doing the shorts.  BUY after each drop in the DOW! Beat Soros and make $$$.
3358 2018-02-20 20:52:34 Tricky wording. From what I understand the USE is prohibited in places but SALES of bump stocks are not. Apparently ppl use them for planters or something wink wink. Be careful when they talk this way, it is purposely deceptive. Note that it allows the profit to continue

3363 2018-02-20 20:50:10 Bump stocks & background checks will never be enough a ban on assault weapons is the first step - trump is trying to appease americans but without hurting his nra cash flow
3364 2018-02-20 20:50:04 wait so you are taking credit for the stock market again?  what about 2 weeks ago when the stocks dropped about 7 %?
3365 2018-02-20 20:49:56 Sarah Sanders: "The President fully supports restrictions on bump stocks".  Tell me again, how he's pro #2A? Tell me again, how this is different from the Dem Party? We need @Federalist_USA.  NOW.
3366 2018-02-20 20:49:53 Donald Trump could revoque his decision to revoque the measures to forbid sales of handgun to mentally ill and requested a revision of the authorization to sale bump stocks to convert semi automatic weapons in automatic ones said Sarah Huckabee.
3367 2018-02-20 20:49:52 Press Secretary: WH Press Conf : President Trump supports not having the use of bump stocks. He ordered DOJ and ATV to review the devices . The review has been completed by ATF and DOJ and a announcement will  be coming in the following days.

Damn, he's willing to go all out to attack the problem, huh? 
WHAT A WEAK ANSWER. She had nothing!
3370 2018-02-20 20:49:13 Sanders says Trump is against use of bump stocks & that there will be an announcement on bump stock ban in coming days.
3371 2018-02-20 20:49:10 Bump stocks will be illegal as per Sarah Sanders. Okay. And how about perhaps looking at sealed school records on anyone under 21 trying to get a gun permit or buy a gun. But everything else should be off the table.
3372 2018-02-20 20:49:06 @johnrobertsFox way to be a jerk John!  She just told you that Trump wants bump stocks gone
3373 2018-02-20 20:48:55 Sarah Sanders says Trump doesn't support bump stocks and to expect an announcement on this in the next few days. Please keep following up on this one @whca

Well done to those that picked up shares at 3.5c and options at 1.8c.

3379 2018-02-20 20:47:42 Fine. Ban bump stocks and end it there. But we know they won’t.
3380 2018-02-20 20:47:35 I don’t give a crap about bump-stocks.
But give an inch........you know.
3381 2018-02-20 20:47:31 White House reporter cites several mass shootings, none of which used "bump stocks", and asks why hasn't the President banned bump stocks?
Bump stocks make rifles wildly inaccurate and are not a pressing problem in the US.
3382 2018-02-20 20:47:20 The White House says President Trump does not support the use of bump stocks
3383 2018-02-20 20:46:59 News from the WH press briefing: Trump doesn’t support the use of bump stocks.
3384 2018-02-20 20:46:56 “The president doesn’t support the use of those accessories,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders says of bump stocks.

Expect action in coming days, she says.
3385 2018-02-20 20:46:55 President doesnt support the availability of bump stocks says @PressSec - the device used by the Las vegas shooter to turn a semi automatic into an automatic rifle
3386 2018-02-20 20:46:49 Presidential/administrative action on bump stocks and incentivizing more info into NICS seems like where we're going. Lots of anti-gun violence groups see those as no-brainers, but not enough.
3387 2018-02-20 20:46:48 Bump stocks are so "last massacre."
3388 2018-02-20 20:46:43 That’s a good question,  my attempt (not sure if it’s good, but what do you think). 
All have to be present:
1: weapon who’s use is not primarily for hunting 
2: weapon can be made fully automated via (illegal) modifications or bump stocks
3: supports high capacity magazines
3389 2018-02-20 20:46:28 Sarah Sanders just said President Trump is opposed to bump stocks.  In response to a question from FOX News.
3390 2018-02-20 20:46:21 "Does not support the use" is not the same as "the president supports" banning bump stocks.
3391 2018-02-20 20:46:14 "Does the president have any ideas — any ideas on how to address this?"

@PressSec references bump stocks, says the president opposes their use, says "movement will take place on that shortly."
3392 2018-02-20 20:46:11 #Trump doesn't support bump stocks? Does he know what they are at least? Of course, followed by promises of mental health programs that won't be funded by his future budget
3393 2018-02-20 20:46:10 White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, asked just now about measures to stop mass shootings: "the president supports not having bump stocks"
3394 2018-02-20 20:46:07 "The Pres. supports to not having the use of bump stocks...the Pres. doesn't support the use of those" WH @PressSec Sanders
3395 2018-02-20 20:46:02 @AriMelber Trump is against bump stocks?  He thinks bump stocks are investments in warts.

3397 2018-02-20 20:45:59 Sanders: The president doesn't support the use of bump stocks. 

Reminder: Bump stocks are an attachment that enables a semiautomatic rifle to fire faster.
3398 2018-02-20 20:45:59 @PressSec: The President is opposed to the use of bump stocks. Expect action in the next few days.
3399 2018-02-20 20:45:53 Sanders says regulatory action on bump stocks could come shortly, ATF have concluded a review. "President doesn't support the use of those accessories."

3403 2018-02-20 20:45:46 "The president supports not having the use of bump stocks and that we expect further action on that in the coming days." - @PressSec
3404 2018-02-20 20:45:44 Some news out of WH briefing:  @PressSec says ATF review on bump stocks now complete and suggests action on that issue expected soon.
Sanders emphasizes that the president does not support use of bump stocks
3405 2018-02-20 20:45:40 We still acting like there's been any progress on bump stocks. Huckabee can't even finish the damn sentence. #PressBriefing
3406 2018-02-20 20:45:40 I was smart enough to move profits from Au/Ag 5yrs ago into Li stocks. Then moved profits back into Au/Ag stock much too early, oh well.
3407 2018-02-20 20:45:32 Sounds like a mini-scoop from Sanders: bump stocks may yet be banned shortly via ATF.
3408 2018-02-20 20:45:32 SH Sanders says the President does not support  the use of bump stocks - may be a new administration move on that soon
3409 2018-02-20 20:45:19 They could ban high capacity magazines again, but they won’t. They could ban bump stocks, but they won’t. They just made it easier for people with mental issues to buy a gun. And if they wanted help with mental health they could give us all single payer healthcare, but they won’t
3410 2018-02-20 20:45:14 Sarah Sanders said Department of Justice has completed its review of bump stocks
3411 2018-02-20 20:45:13 Sanders says Trump supports “not having the use of bump stocks,” says there’ll be news on that (apparently on the regulatory front) in the coming days.
3412 2018-02-20 20:45:13 Q: What about the bump stock? A: The president supports not having the use of bump stocks, we expect further action on that in the coming days.
3413 2018-02-20 20:45:12 @PressSec says POTUS supports “not having the use of bump stocks” and that we should expect movement on that in the coming days.
3414 2018-02-20 20:45:10 Sarah Sanders hints at further White House action on bump stocks "in the coming days"
3415 2018-02-20 20:45:09 "I can tell you the president supports not having the use of bump stocks," @PressSec says.

What. Does. That. Mean? Will they be banned??
3416 2018-02-20 20:45:09 Sanders: "The president supports not having the use of bump stocks and we expect further action on that in the coming days." My understanding is a review has been completed. "I can tell you the president doesn't support the use of those accessories."
3417 2018-02-20 20:45:09 According to @PressSec the president will do something about bump stocks.

3425 2018-02-20 20:44:19 Prohibiting bump stocks is not a repeal of 2A: bump stocks are a work-around on automatic rifles which are prohibited. Asking for additional training, CDC research, database integration for background checks is at least a small step in responsible ownership.

3468 2018-02-20 20:26:48 How about the idea of banning these assault rifles like the AR-15?  Or at least outlawing the so-called bump stocks that turn these weapons into a fully automatic mode?  How many people have to be slaughtered before the NRA wises up?
3469 2018-02-20 20:26:42 They should probably be doing it at the Obama residence since his administration allowed for the use of bump stocks. But I guess you don’t want to talk about that.

3481 2018-02-20 20:22:25 That's a great example. Most people agree on banning bump stocks (even the NRA. Yeh that's right, even the NRA you blame for every wrong in the world). But despite this the politicians haven't done a damn thing. Are you gonna still blame the NRA for that?

3546 2018-02-20 19:53:06 3) military-style is a buzzword, means nothing. Bump stocks are a novelty, sacrificing all accuracy for fire rate. High capacity mags? If you ban them, they are extremely easy to make. Some folded metal and a spring.

3551 2018-02-20 19:51:01 Remember, the NRA will play the long game: glad to have the threat of gun control to boost sales, but making sure that nothing ever gets passed. Study it, talk about it, send it to committee, blah, blah, blah. What every happened to bump stocks?

3558 2018-02-20 19:46:53 Hopefully not allowing unstable people from walking into stores and buying them. Stricter back ground checks with mental health aspects in it, and banning AR-15, AK-47, and any other military grade assault rifles, bump stocks, clips that have more than 10 rounds...

3561 2018-02-20 19:44:59 Today Madison high school students called for universal background checks on gun purchases and banning bump stocks. @WisDOJ and @SpeakerVos say they're open to discussion about allowing schools to arm teachers.
3562 2018-02-20 19:44:37 Congrats. You've picked the right stocks.
3563 2018-02-20 19:44:33 That doesn't make any sense.  You say you're not trying to beat the market with individual stocks so what exactly are you trying to do?  Are you trying to just match it (if that's the case, index funds would do the same thing with lower volatility) or do worse than it?
3564 2018-02-20 19:43:58 You know, they probably did know you were going to run. They probably planned the whole thing out, and you just played right into their hands. And that would make you the biggest patsy ever, even surpassing Lee Harvey Oswald.
3565 2018-02-20 19:42:57 GOP could also easily move forward with making Bump Stocks illegal.  With further political points to lose maybe they could make buying AR's and the like legal at 25 yrs.  Shooters tend to be between 18-25.  Suggest psychotic breaks.  Always some outliers. Nothing full proof

3571 2018-02-20 19:42:02 99.5% of gun owners are responsible... I agree bump stocks shouldn't be available but I also don't agree people should be punished for the crazies...
3572 2018-02-20 19:41:55 Don't want semi-auto rifles outlawed? Fine, instead outlaw magazines with a capacity >5 and outlaw bump stocks. Make minimum 20 year sentence per item for possession, transfer, or mfgr. It would make a big diff & not take guns from anyone.

3579 2018-02-20 19:39:34 Quelques jours seulement après la fusillade qui a fait 17 morts ds un lycée, une société US  fait des promotions de 10 % sur les « bump stocks » qui accélèrent la cadence des fusils semi-auto. Malheureusement, la-bas, c’est la connerie pure qui est en solde toute l’année !
3580 2018-02-20 19:39:03 "It’s easy to comment, once you see the data, but still."

Still what?

I don't think traders only pick stocks based on ticks. More information is needed, like volume.

Also, asking people without making sure their choice carries a real risk may not be the best way to test risk.

3582 2018-02-20 19:38:29 What about when stocks have Shiller P/E of >30. Don’t think they can possibly go up when yields go from 3–>4 or 4->5 from this level. That data set would be for lower P/E ratios hence relative value pricing would allow stocks to continue to rise when yields were higher.
3583 2018-02-20 19:38:18 Owners of guns like AR-15s (which can stay available so long as high-cap mags & bump stocks banned) must admit real reason they want em: Not self defense. A handgun's better. Not hunting; bullets wrong caliber.

Real reason: Shooting them is fun. But fun does not trump dead kids.
3584 2018-02-20 19:37:36 @SenPatRoberts @RepKevinYoder You guys are being awful quiet. How about a statement on what YOU are going to do about gun violence?  We do not need bump stocks, high capacity magazines, or AR-15 rifles. Time to stand up gentlemen. #March4OurLives #worstcongressever
3585 2018-02-20 19:37:31 The Republicans will sweep the midterm elections - even though the odds are stacked against the presidents party- because the stocks will be close to their peak level. But for the Presidential election they could be in trouble because the stocks will be plunging down: Recession.
3586 2018-02-20 19:37:28 It hasn't hit .016 stop lying
3587 2018-02-20 19:37:22 My point was leveraged long exposure to stocks and bonds given starting conditions (yields & valuations) doesn't strike me as a great plan right now from a purely investment standpoint. Could be really well received nonetheless. Just one person's view.
3588 2018-02-20 19:37:11 U can convert the AR-15 from SEMI-AUTOMATIC 2 automatic in two minutes & U can find instructions on YouTube. Bump stocks  R even quicker 2 CONVERT AR-15s from SEMI-AUTOMATIC 2 fully automatic. 
Did U forget. 38 specials & revolver RNT SEMI-AUTOMATIC?
WE all have a right 2 live!
3589 2018-02-20 19:37:02 You should get a mutual fund. Stocks are risky
3590 2018-02-20 19:36:44 You’re right about bump stocks, which I think many Americans would support banning post-Vegas. And you’re technically right about paying fees to own an auto gun but it’s the gun cost that’s so expensive, often $20,000+ making it completely cost prohibitive for all but the elite.
3591 2018-02-20 19:36:42 Bump stocks, bump schmocks.  They're not our problem.   Non-factual liberals and NOT enforcing the LAW is our biggest problem.   Get your head out of your axxes!  #2A
3592 2018-02-20 19:35:45 Indeed. I’ll check stocks
3593 2018-02-20 19:35:14 @IsItCotton Pulling everyone else off but wanted to continue. I agree that a massive portion of the 2A is ignored or obfuscated.  No other amendment is so thoroughly parsed to ensure the outcome satisfies.  I am more concerned with magazine capacity and bump stocks, etc.
3594 2018-02-20 19:34:54 Stocks have been driven by G4 central bank liquidity... That policy era is ending, what happens to stocks now?
3595 2018-02-20 19:34:00 Extreme proposal but this is a false comparison.  There's only one way to vote.  Prohibiting the use of bank products for purchase of assault rifles or bump stocks would only limit the exercise of a 2R right (like legislators & courts do), not obstruct it completely.
3596 2018-02-20 19:33:58 @SpeakerRyan After the Las Vegas slaughter in October you promised to eliminate bump stocks. After every school mass murder you promised to do something. TIME'S UP.
3597 2018-02-20 19:33:54 "Bank of America (BoA) in 2012 ended its 12-year account relationship with McMillan Group International. Kelly McMillan says that BoA told him that the termination was because McMillan had changed from making gun parts (e.g., stocks) to manufacturing firearms."
3598 2018-02-20 19:33:45 Is it just pen tool or pen tool and some stocks to make texture?
3599 2018-02-20 19:33:45 instead of banning bump stocks put them on a class three designation makes it harder to buy
3600 2018-02-20 19:33:21 Lol.....if you buy the type of stocks I like to own, one must have high tolerance for pain and wide swings. I’ll admit though this one has made me grumpier than most. Fortunately O’ SIGO keeps chugging along.

3603 2018-02-20 19:31:42 One of my stocks dropped 3% today 
3604 2018-02-20 19:30:54 1) already have them 
2) that won't stop mass shootings 
3) military style assault rifles are effectively banned already. 30 rounds isn't high capacity. I'm ok with banning bump stocks.

3609 2018-02-20 19:27:55 So we are both on the same ground that an AR-15 is M16 with a reduced firing rate. A military-grade weapon, though not declared as such. Still no reason why it should be available to the public. And right, bump stocks are not in much use. Except e.g. by the Las Vegas shooter. So?

3620 2018-02-20 19:21:43 Also in a situation where stocks and bonds are falling simultaneously, gold only has to stay flat to do its job. That is a low bar! :) 2/2
3621 2018-02-20 19:21:24 no. my scans were pretty simple looking for HOD moves on low float stocks w/ above avg volume - it led me to over trading and chasing so i parted ways with it
3622 2018-02-20 19:20:58 I think gold has a big role to play. In a world where stocks and bonds are correlated, it could the only true diversifier. 1/2

3624 2018-02-20 19:20:03 I do too. I get it. I’m a liberal who has only owned one gun in my life & is far from a gun expert. But I think we can impose some regulations (limits on mag size, bump stocks, & certain semi-auto weapons, as well as a national licensing/registration system) that will save lives.
3625 2018-02-20 19:19:44 Me too. Hate it. And stocks and shares and horrible merchant venturing. Utterly immoral.

3630 2018-02-20 19:16:17 With bump stocks on assault rifles with large clips? Are you serious? You’ve lost all perspective. The @NRA fought legislation that would’ve made it difficult for those associated w terror groups to get guns. Why?
3631 2018-02-20 19:16:12 Remember @POTUS and @GOP making sure bump stocks were banned after #LasVegasShooting ?

3635 2018-02-20 19:15:04 Wrong. The Ar-15 has the ability to hold a VERY large clip. Its semi-auto, but theres plenty of vids on Ut00b showing howe to make full auto. Plus, bump stocks. Easy peasy lemon squeezy and you have a WEAPON OF WAR. Wolfboi needs to research B4 sayin!

3638 2018-02-20 19:14:00 Bump stocks or any other mod that simulates fully automatic rates of fire shouldn’t be legal.

3653 2018-02-20 19:07:54 To start ban all assualt style rifles and bump stocks.  Make certain the ban does not allow for a renaming of the weapon and that it is forever.  That's what I think is the beginning discussion about guns.

3665 2018-02-20 19:01:35 So... a company should say it doesn't want to increase profits, and therefore, the market value of its stocks?

That'll win over shareholders.

3694 2018-02-20 18:52:54 Bump stocks are still legally sold. They turn the ARmaLite into an assault weapon for deranged criminals to spray into crowds of people.

3698 2018-02-20 18:52:13 I personally...believe ..if there are better bets..why to try to bet your money on dead horse...

rather buy qualtiy stocks.. untainted... which you actually desired to buy .... and now they are available at attractive levels... or if markets correct may become more attractive 
3699 2018-02-20 18:51:48 4 Democrats and 1 Independent also voted repealed the Law that enabled unconstitutional gun grabs from faulty written Law. Trump has said he's in favor of the Left's stiffer background checks. After Sandy's Hook several tough laws Obama refused. He legalized Bump Stocks tho.

3705 2018-02-20 18:48:31 As a gun owner, I agree with most of this including bump stocks... but what about a weapon makes it 'military'?  Disagree with u here.  We need security in our schools.  #NoMoreGunFreeZones

3712 2018-02-20 18:46:35 I've never, despite looking, found better data. The biggest uncertainty is in the groundwater data, and specifically the fractions accessible at depth and their quality. Most of the other stocks are well characterized.

3714 2018-02-20 18:45:59 How about rapid-fire semi-automatics with or without bump stocks? OK for the general populace? For 18 year old kids?

3716 2018-02-20 18:45:13 Then say: Don't buy stocks. Which is a very productive advice.
3717 2018-02-20 18:44:15 Buy gun stocks now!!!!!
3718 2018-02-20 18:44:15 Nope
3719 2018-02-20 18:44:00 Are we using USDA numbers or actual ending stocks?  USDA reports as of Oct 1.  They still have 6 months of usage (especially crush) to come out of that.  They are not sitting on 36.22MMT.  Actual carryover around 15MMT.
3720 2018-02-20 18:43:45 All the above. ha.  But in all honesty I think I'm trying to do too much.  Have to many alerts and stocks on  my watch trying to get the big mover.  It can be overwhelming to say the least.
3721 2018-02-20 18:42:36 Fingers crossed  We need you back on top form. Our stocks are very low. We now have standards others cannot reach x
3722 2018-02-20 18:42:28 I'm generally against purely banning things, but I think it does make sense for things like bump stocks to be limited in their availability
3723 2018-02-20 18:42:21 Using “common sense” and “right side of history” are proof you can’t support an argument and you should be in the stocks for 3 days.
3724 2018-02-20 18:41:42 Actually semi automatic can be used for hunting and I use one. Bump stocks are farbage and are hard to use, most true gun owners don’t want them and don’t bother with them
3725 2018-02-20 18:41:34 Ok, I've been beaten down by the leftists, they win. They can have the bump stocks for funding the wall.
3726 2018-02-20 18:41:27 While I have no direct experience with bump stocks, which can allow a semi-auto rifle to fire in something similar to full-auto, my understanding from those that do have experience is that they are very awkward and significantly reduce accuracy.
3727 2018-02-20 18:41:20 Just some perspective on $UBNT here. Andrew Left from @CitronResearch also called $SHOP and $W a short in last year. Both stocks printed new ALL-TIME HIGHS today...
3728 2018-02-20 18:41:00 Love having the day off to do stocks all day :)
3729 2018-02-20 18:40:39 stocks is performative
3730 2018-02-20 18:39:54 Right. Letting the right lead on guns is how we ended up with an expired assault weapons ban, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, no-wait times in many states & a government who is happy to sell AR-15's plus a crate of ammo to suspected terrorists & violent men.
3731 2018-02-20 18:39:32 Now that CES is over and part stocks are existing again, all of my backordered shipments from Digikey/Arrow/etc. are shipping, wheee.

3735 2018-02-20 18:37:31 That more or less visualizes comparison of crypto market vs standard markets (e.g. Stocks). Pretty much explains why prices can literally explode and it’s nothing special really 
3736 2018-02-20 18:37:22 Stocks > crypytocurrency
3737 2018-02-20 18:37:14 In what way is it incorrect? It’s a fact that trump rescinded it. What have they done on bump stocks after it was used to great “success” in killing or maiming 500+ people in Vegas?
3738 2018-02-20 18:37:13 Ain't no limit like Percy but we Like Jada and Pac let's invest in these stocks, let's vacay on these yachts, let's get two of those watches, let's go do it on collins, I fw your style u should be somebody stylist
3739 2018-02-20 18:37:02 .@RyanDetrick Sitting here thinking, which is always dangerous. But the idea that stocks would continue up until 10 Yr Treasury yields reach 5% is beyond my imagination. 3 1/2%, let alone 4% yields would send equities into freefall. $SPX $NDX $IWM
3740 2018-02-20 18:36:42 Which laws are you referring to? The ones that outlaw bump stocks? The ones that outlaw large capacity magazines?
3741 2018-02-20 18:36:18 [migos voice] bump stocks in stocks
3742 2018-02-20 18:35:57 What "decisions" are you referencing? Decisions imply a level of action. Think. Decide. Act. The next time the GOP decides anything approaching gun restraint measures (bump stocks, assault weapons, bullet count) will be the first time.
3743 2018-02-20 18:35:30 Ofcrs real-estate, stocks, bonds and commodities are investments but so are education, art, sprituality, vacations and love..
3744 2018-02-20 18:35:26 SWFPA Chairman stated cod stocks have revived, in spite of EU regulation, not because of them. It is the fishermen who have suffered for decades & who have paved the way for its'revival. If left alone, the EU would allow uncontrolled plundering of our waters.
3745 2018-02-20 18:35:14 OK thanks! May I ask what are ur core Pf stocks..
3746 2018-02-20 18:34:14 Well thankfully those geniuses allow others to profit, not that I was in #UKOG . I tend to avoid any Lenigas stocks as he's a proven POS, very good at making money for himself however!
3747 2018-02-20 18:34:13 I'm all out of stocks.  What am I without them?  I know you were right.  To say I should get some.  I'm all out of stocks.  I'll have some in Tuesday.
3748 2018-02-20 18:34:02 How about diamond jewelries? I'm holding a few #stocks of $7638 ＮＥＷＡＲＴ #japanese #stock #investor
3749 2018-02-20 18:33:45 The really big question is should the media allow its platform to be abused by right wing gun mongers who are in denial that assault rifles equipped with bump stocks and high capacity magazines should be banned because of their propensity to contribute to mass murder?
3750 2018-02-20 18:33:12 No one needs semiautomatic weapons and big clips and bump stocks. Australia got rid of guns after a mass shooting and has had none since.
3751 2018-02-20 18:33:07 If HY stuff still stays afloat ... stocks will be a-floating ...
3752 2018-02-20 18:32:53 @Anirudh_Astro Sir your prediction is going good for stocks. One astrologer told me Mr Shah is unlucky for Mr Modi going forward. True??
3753 2018-02-20 18:32:51 A split second response, get a CHL and carry in your home. Felons technically can’t by federal law, but it’s not enforced well, and there are loopholes such as private sale/gifting. Glad we agree on bump stocks!
3754 2018-02-20 18:32:51 Sure. Close the gun show loophole. Background checks. Outlaw bump stocks. Require safety training. We require these things to drive a two ton vehicle because we aren’t stupid. It isn’t perfect, but it reduces fatalities.
3755 2018-02-20 18:32:32 Ah pero kahit idea po paano napili stocks. Or pa guide if may technical din kayo
3756 2018-02-20 18:32:11 I just love when my stocks go up.
3757 2018-02-20 18:31:41 A- as of present.  He voted for the ban of bump stocks.
3758 2018-02-20 18:31:21 I’m 100% fine with banning bump stocks.  Serious shooters don’t use them anyway - terribly innaccurate and jam. Your ban discussion would be more effective with moving off the “scary looking” guns should be banned to actual facts though.
3759 2018-02-20 18:31:04 Please author and support common sense anti-massacre gun legislation. Ban bump stocks, limit clip sizes, expand background checks. No more mass slaughters in our schools.
3760 2018-02-20 18:31:04 Bump stocks, that turn guns into automatic weapons, still have not been made illegal.  A disgruntled student could easily get one and cause mayhem at a school.  Note Trump and Congress are doing nothing about that.

3764 2018-02-20 18:30:30 @madfientist 
How come you haven’t written an article about the success of buying and holding individual stocks?
3765 2018-02-20 18:30:21 The author states that stocks,  bonds,  and 401k's are not taxed.   Whoever wrote this is totally clueless.   OWH should not print such lies.
3766 2018-02-20 18:30:20 Nope, @NRA spend most of their money blocking sensible controls, like bump stocks. But I guess you support the right to have another Las Vegas, as long as you still have the right to have a AR-15. Stop blaming everything else, but the guns.
3767 2018-02-20 18:30:12 Coming out of my stocks
And I’m doing just fine
Etc etc etc
3768 2018-02-20 18:30:05 And how about GOLD being SLAUGHTERED while stocks and bonds are down?  Again, how much more obvious can it be that #Bitcoin is the new gold?
3769 2018-02-20 18:29:21 Most aren't saying they want laws to confiscate people's guns. They want sensible gun laws and questions answered like "Why are we selling AR-15's, 30+ round clips, or bump stocks to civilians?" What's the need for those? If anyone says hunting, then they're a terrible hunter.
3770 2018-02-20 18:29:20 Algo Stocks trying to understand if rising yields are good for stocks or the riskiest ones might give way to bonds.
Math PhD coders, talking to you.
3771 2018-02-20 18:29:06 The NRA and the GOP was all for banning bump stocks after the vegas shooter....until things quieted down...then they just swept what they said under the rug.  That of which I disagree with.
3772 2018-02-20 18:28:42 Sort of yeh but in currencies and exchange market. Think 500 is more stocks and shares
3773 2018-02-20 18:28:41 We support a ban on assault, semi-automatic and military-style weapons for civilian use, as well as bump fire stocks, like the one used in Las Vegas, and other devices used to turn firearms into what is essentially a fully-automatic weapon.  #gunbuyback #guncontrol #gunamnesty
3774 2018-02-20 18:27:40 Swing traded some stocks in gold overnight and woke up to a $250 profit! Lessss goooo!!
3775 2018-02-20 18:27:36 True, which is why we need to tax assets properly as well as income, especially land and stocks and shares.
3776 2018-02-20 18:27:06 I agree bump stocks should be. Although i can say myself i've never heard of anyone i know owning these atleast or where to get them. But I don't agree semis should be banned. Just take stronger precautions and strengthen and lengthen the vetting process seems sufficient to me.
3777 2018-02-20 18:26:34 I have a do vote for republicans...as well as democrats and independents.  I vote based on the person and their personal policies and if I believe they will be effective.  And I said compromise.  Do I was AR15's off of the street. Yes. I definitely want Bump stocks gone.
3778 2018-02-20 18:26:34 Nobody should invest until they have researched properly for themselves, looked at arguments for and against, ensure they gave a proper understanding doing before investing, whether stocks and shares or trading platforms imo

3780 2018-02-20 18:26:32 The VT massacre killed 32 and wounded 17. The shooter used 2 pistols. I'm w/ya on bump stocks. Minimum age I'm not totally against. Some issues w/that but I won't argue. I thought AP rounds were illegal. Tough problems to solve for sure.
3781 2018-02-20 18:25:54 So you think any private education stocks are potential shorts?  Or is forgiving past loans just a tailwind for new ones?

3786 2018-02-20 18:24:09 You’ve been negative on stocks for years and positive on miners. The market is way up. Miners way down (but still more expensive than market).  Pointing out your earlier tweet is sort of like General Custer pointing out one dead Indian.

3793 2018-02-20 18:23:15 You continue to miss my point. This isn't about bump stocks. OK, ban them, but ban them HOW? If by legislation under Art I, great. But if members of Congress are too cowardly to risk their careers & don't stop bureaucrats from seizing their power/our rights, that must be fought.
3794 2018-02-20 18:22:59 Like freedom to buy assault rifles and bump stocks and armor vests so you can send more thoughts and prayers to more families of students and teachers.

3803 2018-02-20 18:20:10 Only unethical people and industries would own stocks in a private prison corporation!  If you are employed or profit in any way you should sever ties immediately and find a way to repent for contribution in making this country and world a worse place to live!

3808 2018-02-20 18:18:31 @TheFordFaction a rifle is a rifle. You can outfit hunting rifles with the same stocks in the same calibers. Would it make a difference if it had been a shotgun loaded with buckshot, pistols etc? What if the shooter sat back and sniped people with a high caliber hunting rifle?
3809 2018-02-20 18:17:43 So this should continue going up today right

3819 2018-02-20 18:14:43 It’s not that I don’t agree with them; it’s just that they are spending too much effort on insignificant issues. I don’t care about bump stocks. Ban them. Who cares. But don’t ban guns allow med by Heller. Don’t infringe on other constitutional rights either
3820 2018-02-20 18:14:39 Question . . . just how would an "enhanced background check" of the 65 year old who murdered 58 and injured almost 900 with AR-15's and bump-stocks have staved off the massacre in Las Vegas?
3821 2018-02-20 18:14:18 .@GordonHintz says Democratic lawmakers have pushed for gun legislation in WI for years, says it "hasn't been a priority" for GOP. Universal background checks, prohibiting people with history of domestic violence from buying, prohibiting sale of bump stocks are among proposals.
3822 2018-02-20 18:14:14 Too many stocks?
3823 2018-02-20 18:13:26 What happens when market below 200DMA for my #momentum portfolio?

Portfolio doesn't sell everything, but it stops buying stocks if market below it.

Sells are as per separate exit criteria.

3826 2018-02-20 18:12:39 Great. Newt wants to run our schools like Fort Bragg. Ban weapons on mass slaughter. Ban bump stocks. Ban large capacity magazines. Close private and  gun show sale loopholes. Fund gun buy back programs. As a start. Save our kids

3836 2018-02-20 18:09:30 One reason public pensions are so willing to bet on stocks is because of aggressive investment targets designed to fulfill mounting obligations to millions of government workers. The goal of most pension funds is to pay for those future benefits by earning 7% to 8% a year.
3837 2018-02-20 18:09:24 Add to that high capacity magazines amd bump stocks
3838 2018-02-20 18:08:31 Thank you, for posting and I personal Thank Scott though you, Miss Handler.I don't care for"assault type weapons" or "bump stocks".I believe in the 2nd amendment for personal protection and hunting.I wish I could have been military like my late father.I urge people to #Reread2nd.
3839 2018-02-20 18:08:14 Exactly. What we are doing right now works just fine, thank you very much. My gun stocks are worth a ton :)
3840 2018-02-20 18:08:09 Thank you !!!
3841 2018-02-20 18:07:45 The GOP thinks these kids, at least the 18 yr olds, are old enough, mature enough & responsible enough to own AR-15 assault rifles, bump stocks to make them fully automatic, and large ammunition clips, with no training But, not old enough to voice an opinion about those weapons?
3842 2018-02-20 18:07:39 @SpeakerRyan Ban assault weapons, bump stocks, large capacity magazines. NOW. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
3843 2018-02-20 18:07:07 @realDonaldTrump Ban assault weapons, bump stocks, large capacity magazines.
3844 2018-02-20 18:06:05 history hasn't had this debt level before across consumers, corp, govn. History has had better growth averages as well. History also hasn't had stocks at these valuations on the same parameters of debt, yields. Are these fair comparisons.

3847 2018-02-20 18:04:52 And ban the sale and ownership of any and all military grade weapons, large capacity magazines, bump stocks etc etc etc
3848 2018-02-20 18:04:23 US banks (i.e. "KBE") recovered almost all losses. High positive correlation between rising rates and rising financial stocks still in place !
Also, 2nd tier Tech stocks (e.g. #TWTR) perform well.

3850 2018-02-20 18:02:09 Somehow I don't think a road flare would have done the same damage as those bump-stocks did...just a feeling.

And yeah, there are many ways to do bad things...Molotov cocktails...another easy to make weapon.

None with the killing history of guns, though.

3859 2018-02-20 17:57:26 the only bans serious ppl are discussing are on hi cap mags, bump stocks & weapons of war. Not guns in general.
3860 2018-02-20 17:57:10 Thank you for acknowledging that not all gun owners are borderline sociopathic ammosexuals.

>Ban bump stocks
>Ban high capacity magazines.
3861 2018-02-20 17:57:01 dios menudos stocks!
3862 2018-02-20 17:56:35 All States should have the same Restrictive Gun Laws that outlaw Assault Weapons, Bump Stocks, and have thorough Background Checks that make anyone wanting a Gun wait at least 30 Days to do it properly!  There should B Nationwide Gun Laws!
3863 2018-02-20 17:56:17 I love being an adult; There’s no feeling like buying stocks, when on a break, in the gym
3864 2018-02-20 17:56:09 Yes! Now how about bumper stocks? Prosecuting "straw" buyers (as you've suggested)? Higher age limits for gun sales? No sales to people with a criminal record or history of domestic violence? We have a "no fly" list., even though we all have an "inalienable" right to travel.
3865 2018-02-20 17:55:58 Thank you. Bump stocks are just a talking point. I can fire my guns faster then a bump stock will make them fire.
3866 2018-02-20 17:55:03 Bump Stocks are actually legal in most states. Again you are talking semantics. Again, pretty sure there could be some consensus on all of this between responsible owners and experts.
3867 2018-02-20 17:54:44 Who are you defending yourself from that you need bump stocks to convert your AR-15 to full automatic?
3868 2018-02-20 17:54:09 It was recently explained to me that bump stocks and 20+ round magazines are critical to the sport of boar hunting and therefore cannot be regulated.
3869 2018-02-20 17:53:44 Public pension funds that lost hundreds of billions during the last financial crisis still face significant risk from one basic investment: stocks.
3870 2018-02-20 17:53:34 I think we should bring back the stocks on a Friday night in the local market square
3871 2018-02-20 17:53:04 Bump stocks are banned in a lot of places, and other areas are working on it.
Size of the magazine doesn’t mean shit. It takes about two seconds to pop a clip out and put another one in. 10 rounds or 15...doesn’t mean shit.
3872 2018-02-20 17:52:05 Stocks slip as Walmart drags down the Dow
3873 2018-02-20 17:51:56 An age limit on guns....21? 25? If you are certain meds that alter your mental state (many pain meds) - no guns for you. No semi-automatics at all. No bump stocks.
3874 2018-02-20 17:51:16 U.K. stocks higher at close of trade; #FTSE 100 up 0.02%. France stocks higher at close of trade; #CAC 40 up 0.64%. Germany stocks higher at close of trade; #DAX up 0.83%
3875 2018-02-20 17:51:04 Ok, now we are getting somewhere. So we can move to make large mags illegal. Ok. What size is the limit?
Rapid fire and semi-automatic are not the same thing. Rapid and burst fire weapons are already banned. Bump stocks are illegal.
3876 2018-02-20 17:49:47 Tactical weapons with large clip/magazine sizes and rapid fire semi-auto. Bump Stocks seem obvious. I am sure you as a gun enthusiast could offer further suggestions.
3877 2018-02-20 17:48:15 Geez Rick. Students only plan a day of walk-out protest. They are being killed all over the USA!

Maybe you would like to have them flogged and put in stocks?
3878 2018-02-20 17:48:09 Heh yeah there was the one from 62 to 84 or something. The market is so evil. It had to kick the Austrians in the balls one last time & now its going to chew up the masses who've been patiently waiting for their Buffet moment to buy the bottom in stocks
3879 2018-02-20 17:48:08 Yes its very hard to say its too soon because the families and kids need space is very hard when its the families and kids leading the charge. Radical change would be great but AR15s and bump stocks being banned along with a test and universal checks surely would be a start.
3880 2018-02-20 17:47:52 #1 Reinstate the ban on automatic & semiautomatic weapons, as well as the bump stocks, high capacity magazines, and prevent the passage of silencers for these weapons.
3881 2018-02-20 17:47:52 There's more. Close the gunshow loopholes. Ban mods that sidestep regulations like bump stocks. Automatic 3 strikes for any crime committed with a gun. Harsher punishment for negligence. Highly regulate trade and secondary sales. Any violation has harsh punishment
3882 2018-02-20 17:47:44 My coworkers have almost all gone crypto currency crazy. Buying and trading them like penny stocks. They all think they are going to be rich in no time.
3883 2018-02-20 17:47:39 Ban large-quantity magazines for rapid-fire weapons. (Or are hunters worried about a deer stampede?)

Ban bump stocks. (ditto)

The Olympic biathalon limits shooters to a five-shot magazine. After that, shooters load one cartridge at a time.
3884 2018-02-20 17:47:34 1-universal background checks are already being done - problem is that relevant info is not being reported to the databases,
2-the 48 hr waiting period is redundant since background check usually takes that or longer.
3-Even the NRA is OK with banning bump stocks

3893 2018-02-20 17:44:41 @dbongino If bump stocks are going to be banned due to the actions of one man, then the motor vehicles of all who possess them should be banned due to the actions of vehicular mass murders and DUI murderers as well.

3899 2018-02-20 17:41:33 Exactly...we're limited, and other countries aren't. 
But we CAN limit semi-autos and bump stocks. Background checks - a no-brainer. 
I support the kids, who I think will get real traction. 
Funny - in the U.S. you can't rent a car til u're 25, but you can buy an AR at 18.
3900 2018-02-20 17:40:44 Then we agree on what should happen. Ban bump stocks now!
3901 2018-02-20 17:40:37 Great article. It was sad to see how many bills for stricture gun laws almost passed, but didn’t. I’m not for taking away someone’s right to protect their home and family. But, I just don’t see why we need military grade weapons and bump stocks on the streets. #LVStrong
3902 2018-02-20 17:40:27 What this country really needs are strict gun controls to protect against domestic terrorists? Banning assault weapons, bump stocks, strict registrations, mental health purchase restrictions and compliance to all would do the trick.

3911 2018-02-20 17:36:10 Finally, there's no rational reason why anyone NEEDS an assault style weapon or bump stocks and no rational reason why we let teenagers buy an AR-15 but not a handgun.
3912 2018-02-20 17:35:26 Yes & Go big-get no more AR15 & similar weapons! They have no business being in our homes, our streets, schools, malls, concerts. If they want them - make them go to a gun range where they can only be used there!  Also bump stocks no more -LV happened last year, why still avail?!
3913 2018-02-20 17:35:14 GOP controls congress and the White House.  If they had wanted a bill to ban bump stocks, it would have passed months ago.

3920 2018-02-20 17:29:35 Right. I dunno. Something feels off to me about turning our schools into prisons just so a bunch of guys can feel tough carrying around assault rifles. Don't even start with AR-15 isn't  an assault rifle. Bump stocks aren't expensive.

3926 2018-02-20 17:26:23 They believe high school students, 18 and over at least, are old enough and mature enough to purchase AR-15 assault rifles, bump stocks to make them fully automatic, and large ammunition clips. But, not old enough or mature enough to voice an opinion on that same weaponry?
3927 2018-02-20 17:24:16 Why do you think Obama approved the sale of bump stocks? I find nothing to back up that claim. Regardless, we both agree they should be banned. That's progress.

What did BO do?
3934 2018-02-20 17:22:23 That's the thing, there was a man in Broward County, where the shooting happened, turned in his AR 15 because he has enough other regular guns and doesn't want the AR 15 any more.  After Vegas, bump stocks should be banned. So I'm on board and people still have guns 4 protection
3935 2018-02-20 17:21:51 The NRA is not a person.  It's a thing.  A nasty, nasty thing, and needs to be brought down some.  No AR-15s for one.  No bump stocks for another.

3941 2018-02-20 17:19:59 @kaynemcgladrey where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
3942 2018-02-20 17:19:24 Lol I got like 5 stocks rn
3943 2018-02-20 17:19:11 someone needs to own the stocks when they crash.
3944 2018-02-20 17:19:10 True, too true. Executing a combo and executing a ledgedash are both technical challenges, if you fail one, you weren't playing perfectly. Never understood homie stocks for that reason alone. If you SD and lose, I played better.
3945 2018-02-20 17:17:41 My stocks aren't looking too hot today 
3946 2018-02-20 17:17:28 Personally I'm for AR bans again my fear is no matter what we do when the next one happens we will want to go further.  Look at surveillance and how your rights are being abused.  Once you lose rights they keep taking more.   Again I'm totally for AR ban and bump stocks
3947 2018-02-20 17:17:02 We have to control middle man  Make  all India assessment of  stock in SWC, and private  Godowns. Loans are obtained from PSU Banks in Benami farmer's names with lower rate of interest seize such stocks Prices will come down,and farmers be get fair price.
3948 2018-02-20 17:16:52 No one has replied!  That is because what most people (even the majority of NRA members) want is to ban the sale of rapid fire / semiautomatic / military style weapons, as well as "bump stocks".
No one wants to ban all guns -- not even me!  I come from a family of hunters.
OK?
3949 2018-02-20 17:16:14 Do you have any stocks Nancy?  , people in my family do so I want Wall Street to Swoon. You should try to figure out where you can meet conflict resolution to all proud Americans again . Your leaving the voters who support President Trump out of the equation
3950 2018-02-20 17:15:37 You are getting as juvenile as #potus & that's putting it nicely, with your GIF! Your #TaxReformScam is helping the top so corporations can buy their own stocks.

3953 2018-02-20 17:15:13 Since LOTS of the "offshore $$$" corps are gonna bring 'home' bcuz of the #TaxScam is headed into buying stocks, is there a correlation between those 2 1000pt selloff days on Wall Street & big 'buys' by corporations of THEIR OWN STOCK? (nice when it's BEAR CITYwhen U buy!) ^..^

3955 2018-02-20 17:14:52 If yields increase on bonds then some money may comes out of low divided stocks, stabilizing the stock market from running up "too far,""too fast."

We used to see bonds sell, stocks purchased and bonds purchased, stock sold. (2)
3956 2018-02-20 17:14:50 Stocks still bid ...after all the VIX and rates noise, its earnings and growth prospects that count.

3958 2018-02-20 17:14:11 Please don’t give up on the idea banning assault rifles and bump stocks.  Concerned businesses that deal in retailing of assault rifles should also take stock in what they’re doing.  Manufacturers of these guns should be only selling to the military

3965 2018-02-20 17:12:52 @OutnumberedFNC From what I understand, you can buy parts online & make your own AR-15, so you can bypass a dealer.  That doesn't seem right. The AR and bump stocks are not good. I know there's a lot available, but something has to be done to curb these killing machines.

3968 2018-02-20 17:11:27 Out of the hundreds of posts I’ve seen, ONE called for repealing 2A. Every other one called for (&/or): better gun laws incl background checks, training, insurance, proper storage, ban assault style & bump stocks, increased age limit, etc.

3970 2018-02-20 17:11:02 Because crazy violent people can be regulated like the shooter and north korea. Your assumptions that the NRA or any pro 2nd amendment proponents are against any regulation is incorrect. The NRA has supported and stated the batf has the right to regulate bump stocks for instance.

3976 2018-02-20 17:07:56 a few ...
* Close gun show loophole
* Ban bump stocks
* Remove ban on local govt gun regulation
* Restrict assault rifles 
* Ensure data sharing among LEOs & mental health providers
* allow a judge to temporarily secure  guns if family /LEOs show that someone is a threat.

3979 2018-02-20 17:05:55 i'm boot so sure most inv don't doubt it, they just seem to think they can play it out for whatever gain might be left. Every yield term right now is at the highs again w/ stocks rising. Utter greed, ignorance or ballsy

3986 2018-02-20 17:04:44 I NEVER SAID BAN ALL GUNS. 
I literally said I was fine with people having pistols or hunting rifles like shotguns. 
Change the laws and how easy it is to get guns.
Ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Restrict sale of "assault" style rifles.
Require mental health evals.

3990 2018-02-20 17:03:19 Bump stocks are stupid toys for wasting large amounts of money shooting at garbage (usually while your buddy holds your beer). They do not turn a semi-auto rifle into an *effective* approximation of a fully automatic weapon.

You're living in a fantasy land.
3991 2018-02-20 17:03:02 every yield term right now is at the highs again and stocks running with it (for now)
3992 2018-02-20 17:01:44 Tequila stocks tick slightly higher.
3993 2018-02-20 17:01:39 Combat veteran, here. If you handed me an AR-15 & asked me to go back to Afghanistan with it, I'd tell you get fucked.

You mention bump stocks in the next tweet—that goes doubly so if it's equipped with one of those idiotic toys.
3994 2018-02-20 17:01:20 @FLGovScott  while finding out about the 1 FBI error,what about Fl's 39 misses? outlaw ar15s and bump stocks! the time has come!
3995 2018-02-20 17:01:02 Will be more than happy to do that.

Just one query

If it is #operator driven it completely lacks fundamentals

There is no higher price or lower price for such stocks

If it is not operator driven then fundamentally it would remain laggard.

Bandhan Bank has progressed better.
3996 2018-02-20 17:00:21 You’re comparing genocide with e.g. banning bumper stocks, universal background checks, an increased minimum age and not getting an AR-15?
3997 2018-02-20 17:00:12 Why hasn’t the stocks moved in months?
3998 2018-02-20 16:59:50 But while it trades in lock step - its one of the few stocks that offer calls and some pretty serious upside in the Sept expiry strikes.

4007 2018-02-20 16:56:17 2. For restrictionists, there are reasons to tie DACA to say reforms of chain migration and internal enforcement because of downstream effects.  There are no such downstream reasons for gun control supporters to make banning guns stocks contingent on maybe banning semi-autos.
4008 2018-02-20 16:56:00 What about bump stocks, 100-round pistol mags, home made bombs, killer drones, Jung Un rockets -- & naïve #Liberals -- the worst of all.

4011 2018-02-20 16:55:18 Ban bump stocks and it is simply a semi automatic rifle like many others. Get your head out of your ass.

4013 2018-02-20 16:53:19 @MalcolmNance I wish ppl would stop using “Congress” when speaking of legislative inaction on assault weapons, bump stocks, etc. The correct term is “congressional REPUBLICANS”. It is they, and Bernie Sanders and Joe Manchin, who have held gun legislation hostage, not Dems!

4018 2018-02-20 16:51:11 Mag capacity is a function of the magazine, not the firearm. A semi-auto 308 wood stock would be every bit as capable of accommodating a 30 round (or more) magazine.

4055 2018-02-20 16:37:34 In an up-market, you can certainly do very well selling puts since you can typically use margin against the short-put "requirement" of a portion of the value.

4062 2018-02-20 16:33:26 I own a lot of #Potstocks and $THCX is the investment that stresses me the less... because there’s no craziness there and there’s real value. I’d rather be sitting and waiting on a pile of gold than on a pile of fireworks. So nevermind what the other stocks are doing “right now”!
4063 2018-02-20 16:33:15 I know that it's fun and irritating and downright frustrating to have to listen to Trump but Twitter is having a bankroll out of it I wonder if he has stocks in Twitter not that I know I just wondering a lot of wasted time on a wasted person

4065 2018-02-20 16:32:23 I've heard it's hard to short penny stocks, you need a broker that will allow you too. Not 100% sure though.

It's Not The NRA That Just Posted A (0% Drop In Stocks Because Trump Is keeping Us Safe...

4069 2018-02-20 16:31:36 Feds and some states got completely wrapped around the axle by gun lobby on this when they last wrote “assault weapons” laws — bans on “features” such as flash hiders, vert. foregrips, thumbhole stocks & other nonsense. Semi-automatic + stock + detachable mag = Assault rifle.
4070 2018-02-20 16:31:21 S&P 500 turns higher. USD/JPY bid Stocks erase losses

4073 2018-02-20 16:30:48 That kid was able to buy a killing machine.  It shouldn't be that easy to get a weapon of war. The NRA killed the assault weapon ban after Reagan signed it into law and they won't even ban bump stocks. The NRA has blood on their hands.
4074 2018-02-20 16:30:45 OK cool that's what up don't let those stocks go down u can loose it all In one day
4075 2018-02-20 16:30:22 You can’t be “crazy” and be able to pull off these massacres. Semi-auto rifles with pistol grips, scopes, modded stocks, and macho plastic panels are not needed. For anything. You want to hunt? Fine. Bolt action, Iron sights, 7-bullets.
4076 2018-02-20 16:29:10 So you think that placing tougher gun control laws/background checks/ban bump stocks wouldn't save some people's lives?  Naive.
4077 2018-02-20 16:29:03 It was a nice of you to like the top 5 EPS #stocks @SecRiskRptSME $QLYS had a real nice bounce off if its 50 day. Have a great day.
4078 2018-02-20 16:28:39 Been a little silent about the markets these days because I am at a very content proportion of stocks owned to liquidity. The stocks I want to buy have not fallen to where I would be interested nor risen to where I would be interested. 

So am happy to wait and watch.

4094 2018-02-20 16:24:14 Why the confusion on #guncontrol? A demand on a ban on assault weapons, a ban on high capacity clips, a ban on bump stocks, universal background checks, mandatory 3 day wait time, license to own, close trade show loopholes, no sell if on a no fly list/MH watch - all reasonable.
4095 2018-02-20 16:24:01 How much crime did that prevent? This is literally the equivalent of banning spoilers on cars cause a guy who had once rear ended me. But, the “assault weapons” ban, did ban magazine capacity, pistol grips, bayonets, adjustable stocks. What good did that actually do?
4096 2018-02-20 16:22:59 One of my stocks up 16 percent today.

4103 2018-02-20 16:21:41 who gets to determine what is "common sense?"  In the wake of the LV shooting, the NRA actually said they'd support a ban on bump stocks.  Personally, I don't understand why because a bump stock is something that can be easily made.  It's not helpful to simply make laws for the

4108 2018-02-20 16:20:09 Lol - the old “murder is already illegal” idiocy. Nobody says ban all guns. Smart people says “common sense regulations”: strict background checks, ban assault weapons and bump stocks, limit magazine sizes. These won’t prevent all mass shootings, but it will help.
4109 2018-02-20 16:19:43 Good point. But this is not about the defensibility of the business but about the relative valuation of two similar stocks.

4113 2018-02-20 16:18:07 So I own and I bear arms. I still want reasonable restrictions and universal background checks. No bump stocks. 2/2

4115 2018-02-20 16:16:54 its funny, whenever that stocktrader guy says something about pot stocks, the exact opposite usually happens, lol! $WEED and $CANN seeing strong buying now, got to love it :)

4117 2018-02-20 16:16:22 So, keep the coverage up, keep @NRA quiet, and some progress might be accidentally made.  A long gun shouldn't be easier to get than a handgun and there is no reason for bump stocks to exist.
4118 2018-02-20 16:16:21 We MUST 1) Require universal comprehensive background checks for ALL sales/transfers of ALL firearms 2) Mandate 7 day waiting period for ALL sales/transfers 3)Ban the sale of ALL military-style assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc END the MADNESS-SAVE lives!!
4119 2018-02-20 16:15:58 Bearish about rates, stocks, economy?  (Serious Q btw)
4120 2018-02-20 16:15:58 Guys, in all honesty, discussing these stocks on a daily basis is futile. Graphite & Carbon story is a blind buy. You don't even need any conviction to hold these stocks. Govt can put any duty they like. GI & HEG provide 25% of world supply. No GI & HEG means $50,000 spot price.
4121 2018-02-20 16:14:40 1) Require universal background checks
2) Mandate a 48 hour waiting period for purchases
3) Ban military-style assault rifles, along with accessories like high-capacity magazines and bump stocks

This is common sense.
4122 2018-02-20 16:13:13 but often market solutions are reached. Something such as game theory showing that it's perhaps in everyone's interests to take a more environmentally friendly stance- I'm thinking of fishing stocks in particular
4123 2018-02-20 16:13:07 That's well said man. But can we make getting the pistol lower receiver as hard as getting the rifle lower? Or maybe at least as hard as spending our birthday at the BMV? Not asking to much. And eliminate the sale of bump stocks. I bought one. The rate of fire blows my mind.
4124 2018-02-20 16:13:03 Ok, still didn't answer my question because the rifle isn't the problem. Put wooden stocks on it so it doesn't look all "scary" it would have the same effect. Please offer your solution that would stop this from happening. I'll wait.

4137 2018-02-20 16:09:31 I would not be in bonds. Inflationary expectations, Fed tightening & normalization of yields all lead to higher rates & lower bond prices. Stocks are a better bet. They tend to do well in the early stages of inflation b/c prices rise faster than costs, leading to higher profits.

4142 2018-02-20 16:09:07 Pretty sure a fully automatic gun is illegal for most people to possess. You have to have a permit to possess any weapon that comes with an automatic or even burst firing mechanism. (Not including bump stocks and the like)

4150 2018-02-20 16:05:55 Depressing how much of the media in US/UK is swallowing Trump/GOP/NRA line that he's 'open to' restrictions. It's the return of Bump Stocks - small section of the main issue deployed as a delaying tactic, to be dropped when heat dies down.

4156 2018-02-20 16:03:22 If stocks are too expensive in your view for companies to avoid buybacks (which is like reinvesting dividends, but more tax efficient), then you should probably not own them
4157 2018-02-20 16:02:47 I carried  the M-16 in Viet-Nam. The reason we did was to kill large amounts of people efficiently. How do you justify bump stocks to turn AR15s into AR-16s. Tell me again why you need 30- 100 round magazines.

4161 2018-02-20 16:00:48 Funny @NSSF should complain in the @CTPost about @dontstandidlyby @MetroIAF today. Yesterday we wrote to them and asked them to take responsibility for getting bump stocks off the market. Has NSSF ever seen a lethal gun technology they didn't support?
4162 2018-02-20 15:59:58 I would outlaw bump stocks, stop the sales of weapons like AR-15's & AK-47's, etc, impose stricter restrictions on gun buyers in any controllable situation, as well as a minimum age of 21. Those are ones I would start with. Military wins if gov't ever wants absolute power.

4174 2018-02-20 15:53:08 At junctures we sometimes see people wanting to own what they should sell ( stocks now ) and sell (Tbonds) what they should buy. I see the next big multiyear move as a steady risk aversion.
4175 2018-02-20 15:52:31 I'm kinda convinced that a lot of our "growth" is illusory anyway. Easy to watch the numbers in a ledger getting bigger and bigger when you have no capacity to *spend* it all anyway. (c.f. stocks yo-yoing based on the wild fantasies of the upper class)
4176 2018-02-20 15:52:23 Bean mkt complex, but Argentina accounts for 5.5% of global soybean trade at 8.5mmt. A production drop from 54 to 47mmt would rep a 1.5% drop in global production.

4178 2018-02-20 15:51:11 @LeslieMarshall  You are full of Sh%%. Re:AR-15. Any semi-auto with an extended clip could have done the same damage. When will you idiots learn about guns before you open you big mouths?  A tragedy nevertheless.  NRA supports gun safety, background check, ban on bump stocks, etc
4179 2018-02-20 15:50:59 Quite challenging to find stocks where chart setup is not distorted in these times. Happy to find 2 guys who look very promising. Hope they deliver 
4180 2018-02-20 15:50:54 What does the no fly have to do with guns?

Bump stocks they may have been used in one shooting, make the gun inaccurate and make it fail.

Define semi auto do you also mean pistols, deer rifles, everything except revolvers and muskets?

Insurance is this a money racket now?

4213 2018-02-20 15:42:23 t the time, several Senate Republicans agreed and publicly stated that such devices should not be available to civilians. And yet, we cannot get any action on this proposal in this committee while bump stocks are still flooding our streets. It’s amazing to me.
4214 2018-02-20 15:42:16 The NRA stands for National "Rifle" Assoc, not "Machine Gun" NMA. Why not stop making bump stocks, AK 47, M16, AK15 etc avail to public?????
4215 2018-02-20 15:42:11 We agree bump stocks should be illegal. I'm sure we can agree on other sensible changes to our gun laws. The NRA blocks all debate. The victims are piling up. Thank you for keeping the conversation civil. Progress...

4245 2018-02-20 15:32:50 As far as policy change goes, institute universal background checks; improve the background check system to include mental health; and ban accessories that simulate automatic fire i.e. bump stocks.

4273 2018-02-20 15:26:22 I mean to say their claims fall flat because they do not provide sufficient explaination on what they plan to regulate, for instance I support a complete ban of bump stocks because it bypasses federal law, but without knowing what they plan to change I can't give my support over

4275 2018-02-20 15:25:05 Hey @realDonaldTrump @POTUS ! The only "school safety measures" you need to be contemplating, are severe gun restriction laws, i.e. re-instating the bill that you removed re applicants w. mental issues, a complete and TOTAL ban of bump-stocks, and a TOTAL ban on AR's. #GunControl
4276 2018-02-20 15:25:04 I agree bump stocks should be illegal.  As yourself-why did the Obama administration approve them for sale? The NRA proposed that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms make a regulatory change to address bump stocks rather than Congress pass a new law to address the matter.

4281 2018-02-20 15:24:02 From the pro-gun side I’ve heard arguments that the answer is yes. People were willing to support a ban on only gun stocks, but gun control advocates were only proposing broader measures.

The entire point of the bill was to ban devices that turn legal guns into a kind of illegal automatic weapon. ie, bump stocks.
The reason it failed was not the language, it was the NRA.

4307 2018-02-20 15:14:28 You are too funny. If i think it's going up in 30 days, i can't call exactly, but my call is that it would go up in near future. This morning it was 2.80. Deal is NOT finalized. All this is preliminary. Stocks are not instantaneous.  It's all good. Already moving up. relax
4308 2018-02-20 15:14:01 HE'S STILL HERE BOYS! lol what an idiot. This is not the news to see a volume increase buddy. Like do you even know how stocks work?
4309 2018-02-20 15:13:34 full sked ako bukas, may time pa kayang mag trade? hahah buti naklista na ang stocks to watch
4310 2018-02-20 15:13:29 I’m afraid that if you want to make your country safer for everyone, measures will have to be taken. Background checks, longer waiting periods, no bump stocks, no army type rifles like the AR15, are just a few things that can and in my opinion should be done.
4311 2018-02-20 15:12:19 I should invest in stocks asap 
4312 2018-02-20 15:12:05 This time Feinstein did put forth a bill that just banned bump stocks, nothing else was included!
The NRA said it should be handled by ATF, not congress.
That’s why that bill failed. Get your facts straight.
4313 2018-02-20 15:11:59 @davidhogg111 keep up the fight we are proud of u all gun owership raise to 24 gives yrs between school and ownership larger background checks on bump stocks and assault rifle ownership
4314 2018-02-20 15:11:47 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
4315 2018-02-20 15:11:37 Well, my state govt says NO to AR-15, trigger cranks, and bump stocks so....yeah, government can limit and restrain and it should.
4316 2018-02-20 15:11:30 They have just got back to me. As long as stocks last Rachel. It could be a while though as some stores still have the £5 price label on
4317 2018-02-20 15:11:11 And I agree that bump stocks should be illegal. Blame Obama for that.
4318 2018-02-20 15:11:07 I read about modest proposals to change gun laws and can only think NOT ENOUGH. A waiting period for bump stocks? Fuck you @GOP ...this blood is on your hands and we’re not backing down this time. See you in November.

4334 2018-02-20 15:05:16 Good idea. I’m a conservative but I don’t believe that if my child can’t legally by a beer, he shouldn’t be able to buy a gun. Also, I don’t see why regular citizens should have assault weapons or bump stocks
4335 2018-02-20 15:05:08 Yawn. Banning bump stocks is the Least possible action they could take.

4337 2018-02-20 15:04:39 Ban the sale of AR-15s. Ban bump stocks. Strict liability insurance requirements. These are just the simple laws that nobody with a functional IQ can argue affects anyone's 2nd Amendment rights.
4338 2018-02-20 15:04:12 The idea is that they wouldn't service merchants that sell AR-15s (or bump stocks, etc.). It's similar to how they don't service stores that sell marijuana in states that have legalized. It's not just one customer -- it would impact the store overall.
4339 2018-02-20 15:03:24 @zerodhaonline Just an advice,please provide functionality of sorting the stocks alphabetically & newest/oldest added in market watch on kite as it is very uncomfortable to scroll all the way down to search the stock u have added.
4340 2018-02-20 15:03:04 With bump stocks readily available on the market, semi automatic assault rifles are now legally fully automatic. NRA membership fees are supporting GOP’s gun craze.
4341 2018-02-20 15:02:57 It can't hurt. On the bright side, your arms dealer stocks will skyrocket.
4342 2018-02-20 15:02:49 @realDonaldTrump bkground checks are only a PART OF  what shld take place re guns, u r cherry picking.  Those rifles need removal, bump stocks, remove, NO stockpiling, 3 per household, reverse mental health bill on gun owners. NRA can't contribute to politcs in any way. There!

4353 2018-02-20 14:59:02 My gripe is less with the gun and more about 30 round clips and modifications like bump stocks to throw more rounds down range.

4357 2018-02-20 14:57:57 I also disagree that they are generally controversial. Fishing policy is controversial only for some, for example. Many think preserving fish stocks is worth the policy.

4373 2018-02-20 14:52:28 Ban bump fire stocks; Only allow government retailers to sell firearms- no more pawn shop/hunting store retailers; Only allow the owner of the gun permit to buy the firearm- gun giveaways/raffles are ridiculous; Ban/buyback assault-style firearms. Just to name a few. 4/

4375 2018-02-20 14:50:24 We need an assault rifle ban. Ban on bump-stocks and any other gadget that can turn semi-auto to full-auto. Relying on a money-making operation like a bank to stop making money on guns is like getting Republicans to stop taking NRA blood money. Not gonna happen.

*****
Halfway through Obama's first term, the ATF approved bump stocks, that device found in the possession of the Las Vegas shooter, which allows a semi-automatic rifle to fire almost at full-auto.  #MorningJoe
4401 2018-02-20 14:42:59 Does anyone remember when US Govt bonds = risk-free return

Instead of the return-free risk that US Govt bonds represent today?

After 2008 stock market crash, The Fed began pushing grandma & grandpa into higher risk investment (stocks) & out of bonds
4402 2018-02-20 14:42:58 So someone asked me to define what should be band - Bump Stocks - built to allow semi-automatics to mimic the firing speed of fully automatic.  High-Capacity Mags - No one should own 15+ round magazine.  ONLY the military should own a AR-15, AK-ANYTHING, M16, SIG516, etc.
4403 2018-02-20 14:42:47 So what is your take? Why is this stock rallying today? Inquiring minds would like to know. PS Two of my stocks $IDTI & $ICLR are up today!
4404 2018-02-20 14:42:32 And GUN CONTROL W/BANS ON AUTOMATIC WEAPONS &TOOLS THAT CAN CONVERT TO AUTOMATIC WEAPON LIKE BUNK STOCKS!I see trend with legislation GOP is against,like safety&protection of children,unity of families,women's rights&safety, equal rights for all.Well basically everything for us!

4408 2018-02-20 14:42:08 The majority of people actively calling for gun control have very little knowledge of the guns they want regulated. Just look at the bills Senator Feinstein has been proposing since 2004 - ban Ruger mini 14 rifles with synthetic stocks, but exempt the ones with wood stocks.

4433 2018-02-20 14:35:32 The point, for the novices, is that so much more pain can be avoided if the Fed acts early & is ahead of the curve, rather than allow stocks to inflate to unsustainable levels that when the economy slows/falters, the bubble bursts badly, like every time-that's always a certainty.

4436 2018-02-20 14:34:27 Happy Tuesday morning! A little upward pressure on interest rates, a little downward pressure on stocks. Nothing too crazy though, at least compared to what we've been dealing with.
4437 2018-02-20 14:33:34 WOW, Republicans are over TV Advocating more gun control against law abiding citizens.Including,banning bump stocks type devices,Universal Background checks, AR/AK bans,and more public information on private mental health to ban guns without due process.. Democrats talking points
4438 2018-02-20 14:32:44 Bump stocks first gained popularity under obama... and now suddenly liberals have a problem with them? Pretty obvious they are just anti-trump
4439 2018-02-20 14:31:48 WOW, Republicans are over TV Advocating more gun control against law abiding citizens.Including,banning bump stocks type devices,Universal Background checks, AR/AK bans,more public information on private mental health to ban guns without due process. All Democrats talking points.
4440 2018-02-20 14:31:45 stocks headed down right out of the gate this moring. what's that all about?
4441 2018-02-20 14:31:07 @tastytraderMike Id love to take advantage of your earnings trades but the strangles on high price stocks are too difficult with margin. Can you also suggest spreads. i understand strangles are better for management
4442 2018-02-20 14:30:09 My apologies. I just realized that its only for #XRP post. #xrpthestandard +777
4443 2018-02-20 14:29:43 Sir geetanjali was 650 in April 2013 and 32 in March 2016. 5% of what it was in 2013.
It's hard to say whether just the govt changed in 2014 or geetanjali's fate 
Other jewellery stocks like Titan and PC jewellers r over 4 times of what they were in 2013 
4444 2018-02-20 14:29:20 seungkwan still my fave i just ran out of image picket stocks with my bias at that time so i got dk JEKDKSKD
4445 2018-02-20 14:29:17 Colt 45 six shooter and a Winchester rifle is sufficient. Don't need 30round mags, bump stocks or guns that shoot 600 rounds a minute
4446 2018-02-20 14:29:14 (1/2) Proposal: "When there's a mass shooting, which is defined as any shooting with four or more victims, every gun shop and gun range in the country has to close its doors for a month and all trading of gun company stocks are suspended for three months.
4447 2018-02-20 14:28:28 Yea I didn’t know bump stocks switch calibers go from a .556 (m16) to a larger one .(308) (30.6) m60 it was crazy you could totally hear the sound difference. Definitely pros def more then one
4448 2018-02-20 14:27:48 Same thoughts but im scared it might have limited stocks again just what happened to my khino TT
4449 2018-02-20 14:27:29 good morning my fellow traders, lets hope the small cap stocks have a better week
4450 2018-02-20 14:27:28 Trump, Rubio, and Scott have taken huge amounts of cash from the NRA. It's not a gift. The NRA expects and insists they tow the line. After Vegas bump stocks are still legal. I want politicians who serve the people not the gun manufacturers. I call BS
4451 2018-02-20 14:27:24 They killed 58 people and Blamed it on Bump Stocks and the Mental status of the man who committed the crime. All they did was talk about it and talk about it some more. Too many 60 to 70 yr old corrupt politicians clinging to the old ways and taking brides in many forms. Change
4452 2018-02-20 14:27:16 @DeanHeller
No public statements you sir are a coward
Since Republicans have assumed control of the country, chaos has followed.

4455 2018-02-20 14:25:35 The general #stockmarket is overvalued, yes. But the #REIT sector is reasonably priced for the most part.  Ditto for #Energy stocks and #Gun stocks.  We may even see these sectors pushed to deep value territory should a market crash occur.
4456 2018-02-20 14:25:24 Red America can go f*ck itself.  AR-15s wouldn't be legal without red states. Background checks would be the law if not for red states. Crazy people wouldn't have unfettered access to guns without red states. Bump stocks would be banned without red states.
4457 2018-02-20 14:25:23 Why have the stocks closed slightly higher this past week, and how has volatility played into this increase as well as how will this rise affect future investors and large corporations and businesses. @APPropst

4459 2018-02-20 14:23:30 Got an email from a gold mutual fund positioning gold vs bitcoin rather than stocks.  Sounds like they view bitcoin and crypto as legitimate alternatives to precious metals.
4460 2018-02-20 14:23:22 You want to own a Assault Rifle (AR-15 or any other kind), step up and join the US Military and protect all Citizens from any harm.  Otherwise, shut up, sit down, and band all Assault Rifles, High Capacity Magazines, and Bump Stocks.
4461 2018-02-20 14:23:21 Correction in the markets is close to being over, charts are primed for breakouts, btc making it's way back up. Just a matter of time before we see these stocks rally again!

4464 2018-02-20 14:20:21 I am all for "Responsible" gun ownership.  But, I am not for anyone owning a Military Style Assault Rifle (ex. AR-15).  There is absolutely no reason to own one and you don't hunt anything, but people with one.  Band all Assault Rifles, High-Capacity Mags, and Bump Stocks.
4465 2018-02-20 14:19:59 @Ning where do you see junior mining stocks on TSX Venture going in 2018?
4466 2018-02-20 14:19:17 I’m not saying it is imminent, or even likely, but following the latest Mueller arrests - if investigation started to implicate Trump more directly or made impeachment more possible, what would be the kneee jerk fx trade - assume stocks would tank. Thoughts?

4468 2018-02-20 14:18:03 My family is still in bed and I’ve been up for an hour looking at Stocks. This is my kind of vacation! 
4469 2018-02-20 14:17:40 @Bitcoin20K Today I’lm up 90% on 90% of portfolio since 2/6!  Usually under 10% on spec stocks but had to add a 0 (10x) and a Double (x2)!
4470 2018-02-20 14:17:38 All for it. I see no use for bump stocks, and I dabble in almost every form of firearm sport. Though my first instinct would be to require a C3 FFL license to own as opposed to a ban.
4471 2018-02-20 14:17:16 @CNNLIVE_ I watched CNN for ten minutes regarding stocks, finances etc. All women speaking about it! Loved the representation (though not my area of expertise!)
4472 2018-02-20 14:17:07 Lmao not to toot my own horn but 3 stocks on the list is already up over 10% this morning .. God is good
4473 2018-02-20 14:16:29 I just think the central banks have less tools at their disposal this time around.. interest rates are already low and QE won’t do much. Where are people going to put their money? Cash isn’t great b/c inflation will pick up, not stocks, maybe real estate.. but I think Bitcoin.
4474 2018-02-20 14:16:18 That assumes the only people who want common sense gun regulations are in blue states - patently false. MOST Americans support modest notions like no fly/no buy, and ban of assault rifles, bump stocks, etc. Plenty of us are in red states as well- we understand the culture.
4475 2018-02-20 14:15:53 Does this show up in fund flow data for stocks/etf/mutual funds?
4476 2018-02-20 14:15:26 $DCIX This is why it's so risky to hold a stock overnight awaiting financials. Especially consistently bad stocks like this xD
4477 2018-02-20 14:15:26 Wait till the post-2009 class realize cyclical stocks like Boeing and Caterpillar are not actually growth stocks and there is something called an economic cycle (if the federal reserve cooperates and will actually allow it to run its normal course)

4479 2018-02-20 14:13:59 I'm a gun owner. There's no doubt in my mind that we should:

1) Require universal background checks
2) Mandate a 48 hour waiting period for purchases
3) Ban military-style assault rifles, along with accessories like high-capacity magazines and bump stocks

This is common sense.
4480 2018-02-20 14:13:42 Hey maybe our stocks will go back up!
4481 2018-02-20 14:13:41 AR15s were not readily available last generation - neither were high capacity magazines & bump stocks - THAT is why the 2nd amendment needs to be interpreted contextually rather than literally
4482 2018-02-20 14:13:21 I’m a Vet & believe in the 2nd! We are not going to stop gun deaths. I think we need to step back & exercise concerted gun control; eg, no bump stocks & limits on folks with mental health issues, domestic abuse getting easy access! I’m also against assault weapons. My opinion.
4483 2018-02-20 14:13:11 According to Twitter* 
4484 2018-02-20 14:13:09 James, I understand your fear. It's the same that gun owners have in the taking guns away.

Since Las Vegas they still have not blocked the sale of bump stocks.

We can not wait on congress, we need to protect our kids today.
4485 2018-02-20 14:12:30 Some people actually buy such stocks JUST because of these connections 
4486 2018-02-20 14:12:24 Bump stocks don’t make a semiautomatic gun automatic. Pls learn about firearms before you post.

4512 2018-02-20 14:03:50 Great point! The big gains in stocks are behind us as the interest rate tailwind of the last half dozen years is over, and stronger growth now priced in. Stocks were undervalued given rates, but now valuations higher and rates in process of returning to more normal levels.
4513 2018-02-20 14:03:35 You would be warned by most sensible coppers who know that if they waded in every time they were verbally abused by a gobby idiot, then situations would escalate dangerously. We will not agree. I think public naming and shaming is enough - until we bring back the stocks!

4516 2018-02-20 14:02:20 Come up with a bill to ban bump stocks, semiautomatic rifles, expanded magazines, enhanced background checks. #GunControlNow
4517 2018-02-20 14:02:19 So again bump stocks are illegal to attach to a rifle already, so what are we banning? What are people who have the same ideology as you proposing we do? Its honestly a genuine question, I’m really curious.
4518 2018-02-20 14:02:12 Not accounting, but investing - stocks, bonds etc
4519 2018-02-20 14:02:04 Better idea. Ban assault rifles, longer waiting periods for licensing, decrease magazine size, background screening, make bump stocks and silencers illegal.

4535 2018-02-20 13:58:49 Emotional Catherine, I asked a question and if you had done your research you’d know its illegal to attach bump stocks to a rifle. I wanted to make that clear because you brought up automatic weapons, not bump stocks. And I do not oppose to them being illegal to purchase.
4536 2018-02-20 13:58:33 1.36% on 10-year may be all-time low but economy cannot withstand rapid rise in yields and not have that reflected in falling stocks. It won't be a parabolic move upwards in yields despite what so many seem to know will be the case.

4559 2018-02-20 13:49:34 No more NRALackeys in government who promise, lie and fail over and over again. Remember background checks after Texas? Bump stocks after Vegas? Mental health screening and intervention? Vote them out. They had their chances.

4563 2018-02-20 13:47:39 While David Brooks advocates slow consensus building on gun control, I'd like to point out:

91% of GUN OWNERS are in favor of universal background checks. 

82% of Americans are in favor of a ban on bump stocks. 

Consensus has already been reached.
4564 2018-02-20 13:47:38 China stocks weak. No likee. ES where's the love?
4565 2018-02-20 13:47:28 I think there should be laws on how to store guns, and liability if not. That could have prevented Sandy Hook. Banning bump stocks could have at least lessened Vegas shooting. I don’t understand why banning bump stocks is controversial.
4566 2018-02-20 13:46:19 I've seen this off and on with stocks. I think the bots are "tapping the table" to see how fast responses are and to confirm transaction speeds. But yeah, it's as much a sign as a fin in the water that there's bad actors in the area...

4578 2018-02-20 13:40:50 1/2 If we are going to keep assault weapons.. we have to tighten up on everything else.. some say the background checks should be similar to the background checks they get to work in the WH. I would be okay with that. We need to increase the age.. We need to ban the bump stocks..
4579 2018-02-20 13:40:44 Desperate times call for desperate measures, I guess. 
But how much better if govt were to actually do its job and just ban assault weapons, bump stocks, etc., so that companies would not have to step in like this.

4582 2018-02-20 13:40:14 .@marcorubio You r wrong to say we can’t ban assault weapons now bec so many people have them. Australia did it & made it harder to buy other weapons after their one mass school shooting. Ban assault weapons & bump stocks. Provide better mental health care for children.
4583 2018-02-20 13:38:44 Dialogue from my new horror movie screenplay:

Siri:  Okay

4584 2018-02-20 13:38:39 1/2 the -10% shock has not caused any major rotation. Credit spreads have not widen, cyclicals continue to outperform defensives; meanwhile, tech stocks are not underperforming. However, higher volatility accompanying lower liquidity will gradually promote a run on quality
4585 2018-02-20 13:37:52 Except 'assault rifle' is a meaningless buzzword used to describe guns that look scary (even low-power BB guns).

I'm all for banning bump stocks, high-capacity magazines, etc but too many people chiming in don't know the first thing about guns and spread misinformation.

I have no interest in futures. Stay in your lane and Ill stay in mine.
4591 2018-02-20 13:35:54 1) Require universal background checks
2) Mandate a 48 hour waiting period for purchases
3) Ban military-style assault rifles, along with accessories like high-capacity magazines and bump stocks

This is common sense.

4599 2018-02-20 13:32:36 100% I don't agree with any technical analysis. I just  belive accumulating stocks is the best way.
4600 2018-02-20 13:32:33 Because bump stocks and lowers can easily and cheaply convert them to full auto or at least simulate it. If a tool can be easily modified to one requiring a license, then that tool should as well be licensed. Licensing prevents a ban and proven constitutional. Compromise needed.
4601 2018-02-20 13:32:21 The story of the story stocks holds till the upmove continues. The story usually ends with the end of the upmove of the stocks. Most of them  usually goes down and down after that. Some restate their last year's profits also.

4613 2018-02-20 13:26:00 On the former Q: the closest is that paper above (and ones similar to it).
On the latter: for me, if this were ever to happen, a society would need (1) land value tax and/or (2) a similar Piketty-style tax on capital stocks (ex-land), which would require OECD cooperation.
4614 2018-02-20 13:25:44 Or inflation could tick up on stronger growth, & stocks would do alright -- ie not lose too much -- and bonds would suffer. Or, stagflation takes hold, and most assets are screwed. (2/2)

4616 2018-02-20 13:24:36 One popular theme now is that central banks are now tightening policies, reversing years of stimulus, allowing benchmark yields to rise. This will challenge assets that have been inflated in the QE era. So bonds & stocks could sell off in tandem. (1/2)
4617 2018-02-20 13:24:36 The guy phrased it badly. But being on as a talking head, phrasing is his job. But yeah, he's kinda pointing out that stocks are a beauty contest.
4618 2018-02-20 13:23:33 Stocks that are being recommended have usually been bought by big-boys before they are being advertised on social and your TV screens.

4635 2018-02-20 13:13:57 I propose expanded background checks esp for private gun sales, ban on bump stocks, ban on weapons that aren't needed for hunting or self-defense and possibly a gov buy back program. Age limit too, no gun sales to those under 21 except maybe hunting w/parental approval.

Bump fire stocks are available for other weapons. I would be OK with those accessories being regulated like machine guns, personally.

4645 2018-02-20 13:09:07 I'll give you bump stocks but his didn't have one. Also he only cut the barrel, the lower receiver that is the actual controlled part of an AR15 wasn't destroyed. Lol

4653 2018-02-20 13:06:56 If the LV shooter hadn't been able to amass his arsenal of semi-automatic rifles that fired like automatics w/ bump-stocks, I don't think he would have been able to throw knives from several hundred yards away, 20 floors up, and kill 50+ & wound 500+.
4654 2018-02-20 13:06:31 Asian stocks settled mostly lower: Japan -1.01%, Hong Kong -0.78%, China and Taiwan closed for holiday, Australia -0.01%, Singapore -0.33%, South Korea -1.19%, India -0.21%.
4655 2018-02-20 13:06:26 Gains in European stocks were contained as bank stocks declined, led by a 4% drop in HSBC Holdings Plc after Europe's largest bank missed estimates for Q4 revenue and profit.
4656 2018-02-20 13:06:11 European stocks are up +0.06%, led by gains in energy stocks with Mar WTI crude oil (CLH18 +0.65%) up +0.78% at a 1-1/2 week high after OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers reported that compliance with production cuts rose to 133% in Jan.

4658 2018-02-20 13:05:46 Hey all, glad you all seem well! It’s time to switch something up in the gun world for sure. Bump stocks should go and AR-15 should be very very difficult to obtain.

4659 2018-02-20 13:05:43 Also, losses in retailer stocks are leading the overall market lower with Walmart down nearly 3% in pre-market trading after it reported weaker-than-expected Q4 EPS and after it lowered guidance on 2019 EPS.

4662 2018-02-20 13:03:49 London stocks had extended losses by midday on Tuesday, dragged lower as results from HSBC and BHP Billiton left investors disappointed.
4663 2018-02-20 13:03:48 Highly illegal to obtain the parts without a Class III NFA license, which is why it's infrequent. That's why bump stocks.
4664 2018-02-20 13:02:58 AK15 are in a class all by themselves. Bump fire stocks are are specially designed to make bumpfiring easier, which allows semi-automatic firearm to mimic the firing speed of fully automatic firearms. They can achieve rates of fire between 400 to 800 rounds per minute

4692 2018-02-20 12:56:10 @CNBC Think the offer might be at a discount, if Alberson starts trading at $19.74 on merger close. The details give me a total transaction value of $2.157 billion for RAD.
4693 2018-02-20 12:54:50 Topstory: Global stocks struggle as bond yields, dollar regain trac
4694 2018-02-20 12:54:24 GMO forecasted 7 years ago that EM stocks would outperform US stocks by 5.4% a year.  They underperformed by 11% a year.  You couldn’t be this bad at forecasting if you tried...
4695 2018-02-20 12:53:09 5200 I have I don’t even remember buying the other 3200 lol
4696 2018-02-20 12:52:51 Lol Nice!!
4697 2018-02-20 12:52:16 GMOs 7-year forecast for US stocks in 2011 was +1.4% a year.  Actual? +12.0% a year.
If it wasn’t for bad forecasts, we’d have no forecasts at all...
4698 2018-02-20 12:52:11 The Vegas shooter killed 58 and wounded 489! It would have been easy to ban bump stocks after that but nothing happened. Paul Ryan will not bring gun safety legislation to the floor no matter how horrible the tragedy.  Republicans have pledged allegiance to the #NRA. #MorningJoe
4699 2018-02-20 12:49:52 @Call_Me_Dutch @ChrisVanHollen @SenatorCardin what are you doing today to solve gun violence in this country? What are you doing to ban assault weapons and bump stocks and other gun enhancements that have no place in either sports or hunting? #GunControlNow #NeverAgain
4700 2018-02-20 12:49:09 Similar for me, sitting 1-2% below all time highs after decent consolidation in all of my stocks. Bring on the spring.

4702 2018-02-20 12:48:11 No one needs magazines that hold 100’s of rounds, assault weapons or bump stocks. If you’ve committed a violent crime, are suicidal or a danger to others mentally or have committed domestic abuse then gun for you. Simple. But the NRA and Ben by support want silencers on guns!
4703 2018-02-20 12:48:09 #Cryptocurrencies > #Stocks, federal holidays can't slow or impede a #crypto bull rally, like they can with other typical types of securities.
4704 2018-02-20 12:47:53 If I track it down I'll share it. I think it's a good argument as well, though it seems like asset is also a loaded term (implies similarities to stocks/securities to many). Will be interesting to see how the nomenclature evolves as the field becomes more mature
4705 2018-02-20 12:47:47 US Treasury set to auction over $150 billion of bills and notes today, pushing yields higher, dollar higher and stocks, bonds and precious metals lower.

4716 2018-02-20 12:41:51 I disagree. He bought bump stocks and large capacity rounds. Certainly there are probably crazy people who could manufacture large magazines, but I just don’t find that to be a plausible rebuttal. It would save many, many lives over the course of a decade in mass shootings.
4717 2018-02-20 12:41:17  that is absolutely spot on!

4735 2018-02-20 12:34:27 They have not done anything.  Rep, Dem AND NRA agreed to ban bump stocks and Nothing Got Done.

4742 2018-02-20 12:32:16 Well then that proves we need to take the right to own an AR 15 away. And bump stocks and no silencers
4743 2018-02-20 12:31:27 The mouth of the NRA. What we need are trained armed School Resource Police Officers in ever school. We need to raise the age to 21 to purchase a firearm, thorough back ground checks and out law bump stocks.
4744 2018-02-20 12:31:11 If you are talking abt Nifty stocks t thn everything was normal. Adv decline of Nifty stocks was neutral. 
Also SM has many theories of bottom bt earlier 630 was getting rejected now even 430 getting rejected
4745 2018-02-20 12:30:16 THIS CAN'T HAPPEN!!   “something must be done,” which take up attention briefly and then fizzle out—like the pledges from congressional leaders after the Las Vegas massacre five months ago to address bump stocks, which so far have amounted to nothing.

4753 2018-02-20 12:27:20 BS. Many of us WITH guns believe assault rifles, mega clips, and bump stocks should be banned. We are also against silencers and cross state carry. We support background checks and limiting ownership for those deemed a threat. NRA pushing us against them propaganda-I call BS!

4758 2018-02-20 12:25:23 Everything I am hearing make sense. Band bumper stocks, waiting 3 days for hang gun, deeper background checks, no guns for felons or any mental illness issues,must be 18 years old. Also one way into schools with guards, teachers willing to training then carry with extra pay.

4763 2018-02-20 12:23:19 Exactly! If more guns make us safer then why don’t we protect our lawmakers and president by allowing the public into congress and the White House armed with AR-15s equipped with 100 round drum magazines and bump stocks? Don’t they deserve to be that safe?

4800 2018-02-20 12:06:53 I’m all for your right for guns. I just don’t understand why you need bigger magazines and bump stocks that allow the ability to make a semi auto not a semi auto weapon. I thought that was then illegal? There’s more deaths with handguns then AR’s anyhow

2. Governments print money  when they wanted, even they don’t need it.
3. Many people can’t buy good stocks (e.g. Amazon) from their countries. 
4. Some countries, governments own lands too.

That’s why most of us choose crypto assets (e.g. Bitcoin)

4886 2018-02-20 11:19:28 It's interesting to realise that the cost of buy-to-let (and thus housing) has risen so it's broadly the same return on investment as stocks. A typical p/e ratio for a stock is 15-20, about the same as the ratio of rent to house prices

4943 2018-02-20 10:42:04 If it's that great why do you need a veto safety net?

4970 2018-02-20 10:10:27 I disagree with $ up stocks down as a given. 10y real rates at 90bps are not a headwind for stocks. However they look like they may break higher in which case we can have higher dollar and eventually lower stocks. I don’t think higher dollar kills spx yet
4971 2018-02-20 10:09:46 I thought that the rise in stocks had little to do with the real economy.

4984 2018-02-20 09:58:49 a better compromise. Exceptions should not be made, however, for these semi-automatic weapons and the accessories, such as bump stocks, that can make them almost automatic. These weapons are made for mass killing otherwise they wouldn’t be made to shoot 45 rounds per min (3)
4985 2018-02-20 09:57:17 This is for folks bullish on Fortis:

A member in our CHD group who tracks Damani, says he holds stocks for as long as 7 years for good gains. 

Unsure how to interpret the news.

4987 2018-02-20 09:54:23 #StockMarket  US retirees and those close to retirement have to secure their gains of the last 40 or 50 years. Think in terms of dividend growth, US, Europe, and EMarkets, intermediate global bonds, gold, and laddered Treasuries. Beware inflation is coming and stocks will crash.

5173 2018-02-20 07:24:32 Thanks for the kind feedback, Harry. What attracted me to the original letter was the inclusion of real estate and especially commodities. Too many private client managed portfolios are in (c. 60%) indexed stocks and (c. 40%) indexed bonds, and not much else.

5193 2018-02-20 07:03:49 This is my concern. I feel like they won't bend on low hanging fruit like bump stocks. My friend needed a gun. He had a stalker obsessed with his  wife & 7 yo son. I totally get that. My friend doesn't need an AR-15 though. He knows that.
5194 2018-02-20 07:02:18 The best way forward will require many steps on a NATIONAL level, but the obvious starting place is banning assault weapons & bump stocks. Close the loopholes in background checks. Outright bans based on age, mental health, domestic violence & other violent crime.

5215 2018-02-20 06:43:25 Didn’t the NRA (in an act of conciliation) come out and say they would support a ban of bump stocks? If they can outlaw a sawed off shotgun (I’m pretty sure those are illegal), they can outlaw a bump stock.

5220 2018-02-20 06:38:47 In other words, you have no idea. But if we start with the most obvious problems, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, and Trigger cranks, we could make a difference. Are you even willing to entertain that?

5308 2018-02-20 05:38:46 Really? Nothing? Closing the gun show loophole? Revoking gun rights to those convicted of domestic violence and animal abuse? Outlawing civilian ownership of bump stocks and suppressors? Funding some level of nationalized mental health system or destigmatizing mental illness?

5322 2018-02-20 05:31:20 +1: ”I’m a gun owner. There’s no doubt in my mind that we should:
1) Require universal background checks
2) Mandate a 48hr waiting period for purchases
3) Ban mil-style assault rifles, aaccessories like high-capacity mags & bump stocks

This is common sense.” (via @IronStache)

5329 2018-02-20 05:25:57 Bump stocks make your distinction moot. Sadly, GOP fails to keep that element of our citizen militia “well regulated”.

5331 2018-02-20 05:24:42 Ban bump stocks, high capacity magazines, automatic weapons, semi automatic weapons. Do better background checks. Ban any specific features or modifications designed to mimic automatic weapons.
5332 2018-02-20 05:24:37 Ban Stocks.

5340 2018-02-20 05:20:39 No worries bro. Most of the polices are still in place. Non background checks are a federal offense I believe. Bump stocks are already illegal in almost all states. In my state domestic violence offenders have their guns taken. Not sure for all states though.
5341 2018-02-20 05:20:18 Bump stocks became legal during the Obama Administration. You probably never heard of them, until the Vegas shooting.
5342 2018-02-20 05:20:18 Yes agree. But if you look stocks like India cement, prism cement, FSL, SunPharma, Manugraph industries had good price pattern but none of them work well so in this market even technical method is not working.

5348 2018-02-20 05:16:34 Sorry dude I got busy for a sec. Should be universal background checks, ban bump stocks, seize the guns of people convicted of domestic violence and increase mental health spending.

5350 2018-02-20 05:16:33 folks i’m going to eat a gun every morning until bump stocks are illegal. please donate to my gofundme link in comments, as this is proving to be kind of expensive
5351 2018-02-20 05:16:02 Any karma good or bad is given time,it multiplies. Holding good stocks for long periods give you good returns and bad stocks if held gives bad or negative returns
5352 2018-02-20 05:14:58 In FL u walk in, buy ar15 and walk out. So yeah, ban assault weapons (like it was under Bush until it expired).  Ban bump stocks. No sale to under 21. Or mentally ill, dom violence or terror watch list. Restart the cdc research that gop stopped. Uni backgrounds.
5353 2018-02-20 05:14:55 you can fire any single shot gun like a machine gun with or with out a "bump" stock, 7 yrs active duty army and it is more than possible, hand guns don't have bumps stocks and I can give you a list of a few mass school killings with 10+ in each NO RIFLES
5354 2018-02-20 05:14:21 1. Raise firearm age to 21
2. Make gun crimes federal offense (jail/confiscation)
3. Background checks on private gun sales 
4. Improve locking mechanisms @ school
5. Armed guards at schools 
6. 30-day waiting period on semi-auto guns
7. Enhance flagging system
8. Ban bump stocks
5355 2018-02-20 05:14:01 It seems that we are entering a new rising rate cycle-interest rate cycles usually last 22-37 years - doesn't necessarily mean that stocks can't continue to rise but need to keep an eye on the 10 yr T-Bond yield #stocks #markets #inflation #Bonds #Rates
5356 2018-02-20 05:13:53 We can hope, seems to me that the whole shambles has been orchestrated by Turnbull to get rid of Joyce, selective leaks, bonkban, etc. I wonder if he is so narcissistic that he thinks dismantling the coalition will raise his stocks?

5358 2018-02-20 05:10:45 “Ban semi automatic guns!”
“We need bump stocks!” 
There’s a common ground without banning a gun. But making everything safer.
5359 2018-02-20 05:09:20 Actually moron.  It did not fall anywhere even close to the amount it rose.  Stocks rise and fall bone head.
5360 2018-02-20 05:09:15 Wrong , it's the Society that has developed in the US over the last 250 years that tolerates extreme violence . Also every kid in Switzerland may own a rifle , but those guns aren't AR15s with Bump Stocks .

5362 2018-02-20 05:06:36 Allowing for magazines of fixed size of ~5 allows for hunting and self-defense (latter imo spurious in comparison to guns), but doesn't have the same mass shooting risk. Add prohiition of bump stocks, cranks and equivalent devices, and you have the outline of a reasonable policy.

5366 2018-02-20 05:02:12 My suggestions:

1. Raise firearm age to 21
2. Make gun crimes federal offense (mandatory jail time & confiscation)
3. Improve locking mechanisms @ school
4. Hire armed guards at schools 
5. 30-day waiting period for semi-auto rifles 
6. Enhance flagging system
7. Ban bump stocks
5367 2018-02-20 05:02:10 this won't do it-we need a complete ban on assault guns and bump stocks. these are unnecessary for a civilian population.
5368 2018-02-20 05:02:03 Mental health is just a small part and yes it should be addressed but not at the expense of other obvious moves. Bump stocks, selling AR15's, and even people on the terrorist watchlist can buy guns. You watch, mental health will get half a pass & the rest will be lost.
5369 2018-02-20 04:59:49 Hopefully it doesn’t go the way of banning bump stocks.  Republicans quickly brushed that to the side.
5370 2018-02-20 04:59:16 Get rid of the AR15, mass murderers’
weapon of choice. Used in Vietnam Nam, semi automatic.
No one needs to own weapons of war.
Prohibit the sale of bump stocks & high capacity magazines.
Institute tough background checks.
Say “No” to NRA money.
Save Lives.
5371 2018-02-20 04:58:30 How about:
1) Close current loopholes (i.e. private sales don't req background check)
2) Ban bump stocks (I know they can be made, but it's about reduction)
3) Allow the CDC to study gun violence w/out fear of lost funding
4) Reinstate AR ban
5) Revisit mental health/gun laws

5375 2018-02-20 04:57:19 Privatization of public sector banks is still ok as long as FDI is not invited. There should be some mechanism to allow only Indian citizens to buy banking stocks, IMO allowing foreign money in banking can create a huge problem if those banks give loans to defaulting companies.
5376 2018-02-20 04:56:25 The NRA support the batf ban on bump stocks so the NRA IS FOR REASONABLE GUN REGULATION.
5377 2018-02-20 04:56:04 After Vegas, the NRA and GOP were open to discussions on bump-stocks (because they're useless) but the Feinsteins of the world said "Oh, yeah? Well, let's talk about magazine capacities and assault rifles" 

Leftists will never be satisfied with "common sense" blah, blah, blah.
5378 2018-02-20 04:55:41 I think before he got off 120 shots, he likely would have been disarmed.  
I was trying to make a point about, at the very least, restricting access to, or eliminating, semi-auto rifles, and outlawing bump stocks.
We have to make an actual effort to reduce gun deaths.
5379 2018-02-20 04:55:30 Yeah, why doesn't Chicago have more struck gun laws, maybe a ban on bump stocks or ar15 will help?
5380 2018-02-20 04:54:06 your NRA propaganda is exactly what we don't need. no civilian should own an AR-15. period. no more bump stocks. no more large mags. mental health checks mandatory & checks for all hopeful owners, inc gun shows & private transfers.
5381 2018-02-20 04:52:40 HomeDog, you listen to Neil young too?
5382 2018-02-20 04:51:58 I remember bump stocks. I even remember a lot of people accepting the idea with some trepidation. Their worries were realized when fucking leftists toon the opportunity to try and ban modified triggers, actions, receivers, and semi autos all together. Fuck gun control.

5396 2018-02-20 04:41:43 Normal practice to show higher stock as bank margin is very high particularly for old stocks so as to take desired credit. Technically every industry may be at default. Banks also require correction in its policies to help industry
5397 2018-02-20 04:41:43 Thats a start. And oh yes, make bumper stocks illegal. Congress promised action on that after Vegas massacre and ZERO done!

5415 2018-02-20 04:33:51 Sir, Can we add stocks in small numbers after dips. Investment will be for more than 10 yrs as you recommend?
5416 2018-02-20 04:33:09 Agree with everything but point 3. This would quite literally solve next to nothing. The only mass shooting that would likely have been significantly less deadly without an "assault rifle" is Vegas. Bump stocks can be illegal as far as I'm concerned tho.
5417 2018-02-20 04:31:43 I don't know if the top is in. It probably will recover eventually. My point is that there are thousands of retail BTC investor under water who had to sell stocks to cover their crypto losses and that affected the market.

5419 2018-02-20 04:30:01 Have far less recoil than a bolt action, and adjustable stocks make them great for shorter armed people that will grow. Also great for left & right hand shooters. Smaller mags keep weight down. A question that’s also pertinent: what is the reason for owning a high capacity mag?
5420 2018-02-20 04:29:58 pinuntahan ko na lahat ng mall dito sa Davao pabalik balik na ako pero wala pa rin silang stocks! Kaya pa reserved na lang sa waiting list of every branch! hello @nbsalert update naman please thank you!  #365DaysofFeels @noringai at #MuntiknaMagingTayo @akoposimarcelo 
5421 2018-02-20 04:29:54 So act! Ideas: Improve K-12 school security. Educate teachers, parents, MD's. Improve mental health services. Ban sale of guns/"rifles" to anyone <21. Ban unlicensed gun dealers. Have a 2-day minimum waiting period. Improve nationwide background check system. Ban bump stocks.
5422 2018-02-20 04:29:14 My vote is for more strict background checks and magazine size limits. Also, eliminate bump stocks and other devices that convert semi-auto to essentially being full-auto.
5423 2018-02-20 04:29:13 “So you’re saying” (not in the silly way Cathy Newman used it, Foxnose) the article implies that as $BTC rises these people will recoup prior losses and be able to repurchase stocks? Makes sense but would have to be verified w/numbers ie % retail composition of Nasdaq etc.
5424 2018-02-20 04:29:06 Who are they buying the stocks back from: the shareholders, 401k, and IRAs. The funds are then reinvested.
5425 2018-02-20 04:27:20 are they as bad as pump stocks?
5426 2018-02-20 04:27:12 Just banning military style semi auto weapons, bump stocks and high cap mags would be a start though. Numbnuts. Seems to work everywhere else.

5428 2018-02-20 04:25:32 So if we agree on getting rid of bump stocks what’s the argument?
5429 2018-02-20 04:25:10 This is an option piece and not fact. While the writer is right one some points, he is wrong when saying it is just as accurate as stock. But again, even the writer says it’s not fully automatic. And again, even the NRA supports regulating the crap out of bump stocks.
5430 2018-02-20 04:25:08 I think Michael Moore and Rosie have bump stocks for their forks.

5433 2018-02-20 04:24:13 I'm a gun owner. There's no doubt in my mind that we should:

1) Require universal background checks
2) Mandate a 48 hour waiting period for purchases
3) Ban military-style assault rifles, along with accessories like high-capacity magazines and bump stocks

This is common sense.
5434 2018-02-20 04:24:06 Remember how the Democrats over reached when Republicans agreed to ban bump stocks?
5435 2018-02-20 04:23:44 pump stocks? I confess I'm unfamiliar with pump stocks. Have a link or photo?
5436 2018-02-20 04:23:20 I'm a gun owner. There's no doubt in my mind that we should:

5439 2018-02-20 04:22:22 Just the AR-15. Let's start there. High capacity magazines and bump stocks. Oh and Trigger cranks.
5440 2018-02-20 04:21:13 You mean ammunition stocks ?
5441 2018-02-20 04:20:25 The NRA was on board with banning bump stocks, Obama admin sold them anyway. Silencers, don't work like in the movies. There are no loopholes, despite what they tell you and we already have background checks.
5442 2018-02-20 04:19:45 ほぼノーポジ
5443 2018-02-20 04:18:43 I really don't care if you believe me or not. 

So let's start with the AR-15 in particular. And high-capacity magazines. And bump stocks.
5444 2018-02-20 04:18:39 I’ve been shocked for years that bump stocks weren’t regulated by ATF. As an AR owner, I’d be OK with outlawing mags larger than 10 or even 5 rounds.
5445 2018-02-20 04:17:46 Here’s basic economics for you. When the average American gets more money they immediately put it back into the economy by spending it. That in turn creates more business for businesses which allows them to hire more people for the increased demand. The rich put it into stocks.
5446 2018-02-20 04:17:40 Doubt it since stocks went to shit for a good two weeks. I even lost some money with Apple.
5447 2018-02-20 04:16:58 @realDonaldTrump  We just want to make a living...Commercial Fishermen East Coast. BTY rockfish stocks are back to normal, but we still have quotas and 2 mile stretch of ocean to catch them in. Expand the EEZ to 9 nautical miles
5448 2018-02-20 04:16:44 Lasa Supergenerics, a stock from the recent high of Rs 212 to Rs 122 and still on lower circuits. This is how stocks with perception problem work as soon as sentiments change. There are no takers for them.
5449 2018-02-20 04:15:54 Also helps get rid of old weapons stocks, I presume.
5450 2018-02-20 04:15:04 NRA supported the stop of the sale of bump-stocks
5451 2018-02-20 04:14:58 The one biggest strength of an investor wd be to not do anything. Just enjoy the fall, read more and cherry pick the stocks at 20-25-30% lower prices.
5452 2018-02-20 04:14:08 But on the other hand the stocks on CIGARS went up!

5458 2018-02-20 04:12:41 You really don’t know why bump stocks haven’t been banned?  Or was that rhetorical?
5459 2018-02-20 04:12:36 Background check, waiting period, ban high capacity magazines and bump stocks
5460 2018-02-20 04:12:18 I said it was autocorrect, dipshit. But you're not worth the edit. 

So make your case for not banning AR-15 or bump stocks
5461 2018-02-20 04:12:06 You mean bump stocks?
5462 2018-02-20 04:11:35 with automatic pump-stocks
5463 2018-02-20 04:08:45 @realDonaldTrump search u tube for increased rate of fire AR 15. You will find many ways to do what bump stocks do, you can use just your finger or add a rubber band. U can also use belt loop.
5464 2018-02-20 04:07:59 Agreed. Hopefully, we let him out to pasture this fall. People aren’t advocating taking away guns. Only some reasonable laws that could make a real difference. Ban high capacity magazines. Make crime involving them have long prison terms, no parole. Ban bump stocks.
5465 2018-02-20 04:05:31 Move your money to Canada.  Our government makes sure our banks are the safest in the world.  Their stocks went up in the 2008 crisis.
5466 2018-02-20 04:03:58 I don’t think it will. There have been mass shootings long before. But I do believe they shld be banned as well as bump stocks. But congress won’t pass anything as usual
5467 2018-02-20 04:02:05 The 2nd amendment does not specify "musket" because they knew that technology would get better and they knew that having the citizens living in the past was a really bad idea. Bump stocks increase rate of fire but dramatically reduce accuracy. It's much worse than an actual auto
5468 2018-02-20 04:01:06 Great - because it is time to stop terrorists, mentally deranged and violent people from being able to buy automatic rifles, bump stocks and large capacity magazines.  It is so obvious.   Do it!
5469 2018-02-20 04:01:05 Do we live in the same country? Companies are using their tax reform money to buy back their stocks not invest in America. Employment is the same since you took office around 4 percent unemployed. The poorer aremuch worse off and your cutting Medicare and Medicaid.

5478 2018-02-20 03:59:00 I dont wanna act like banning every gun is the answer. But starting with banning ARs, bump stocks, cranks and implementing testing, training, insurance, no sales at shows or auctions, and monthly checks with possible fines and seizure of weapons for lack of compliance is a start.
5479 2018-02-20 03:58:52 You need to also prioritize childrens' safety from gun violence.  Say NO to automatic rifles, bump stocks and gun sales to terrorists and mentally deranged.  It's so obvious, but we need to make it happen! No excuses.

5482 2018-02-20 03:58:36 I think a major cdc study as well as a reconfiguring of weapons classification. Ban things like bump stocks from being made and AR-15, AK-47 from civilian sale and once the reclassification happens that puts like weapons together, ban those. Cdc study would create further fixes.

5486 2018-02-20 03:55:32 Lol the Hell they didn't! Bump stocks and any fire rate altering part? They were screaming about the same shit about weapons ban weapons ban. You seriously don't remember that?

5495 2018-02-20 03:50:48 From making it easy for the mentally-ill to buy guns to keeping AR-15's & bump stocks legal, the NRA has been supporting mass murder so they can stoke fear & make more blood money off of guns. Too many lives have been lost. The people are fighting back now.

5497 2018-02-20 03:49:56 ...because I'm not seeking to ban all guns. Congress needs to regulate magazine-capacity. That way, bump stocks will become ineffective and AR-15's won't fire off more than 5 or 6 bullets per round.
5498 2018-02-20 03:49:03 Have you heard of bump stocks.

Im guessing by that response NO!
5499 2018-02-20 03:48:11 If they treat you like this for being right, is it any wonder why more people aren’t willing to do more research and short stocks? Who wants this as their reward?

5501 2018-02-20 03:46:42 Bill is not enough. All it does is enforce what is already on the books. And bump stocks isn't the issue... It's much larger.
5502 2018-02-20 03:45:51 He's right. Bump stocks is all they wanted. Then they all said "you can have them" and then the story just disappeared from the news.
5503 2018-02-20 03:43:55 @NRA calls the shots on our gun policies. Why did they get @GOP to block Obama's regulation to keep guns out of mentally ill hands? @GOP has done NOTHING about banning bump stocks. NO ONE wants ur pistols or rifles but there is NO REASON 2 own a assault rifle but 2 kill people.
5504 2018-02-20 03:43:44 Bump Stocks are not integral to keeping or bearing arms. Although some stupid federal ban on them would mean zilch, zero, nada to preserve, protect or defend life. Want to really save lives?... ban late term abortions.
5505 2018-02-20 03:42:57 There are anywhere between 5 and 10 million AR-15s (conservative estimate) in the United States. Good luck trying to collect them. 

There are measures that can be taken. Raise purchase age to 21. No bump stocks. Longer waiting periods. Armed school security.
5506 2018-02-20 03:42:16 Ban semi-automatic weapons, armor piercing bullets, bump stocks, and large capacity magazines. Fix the gun show loophole, require thorough background checks, and require gun safety class.
5507 2018-02-20 03:41:43 I think this is a good deterrent. Like having a barking dog in the house. Gun free zones are obviously not working, criminals do not follow laws and they would get an AR-15, bump stocks, high capacity magazines whether legal or not.

- Must be age 21 to buy guns 
- Total ban on bump stocks
- Limit on magazines to 10 bullets
5524 2018-02-20 03:31:58 I think bump stocks are a way that gun add-on manufacturers get around laws re: fully automatic rifles.... bc while the underlying gun is not FA, the modification makes it fire with a similar rate of fire..
5525 2018-02-20 03:30:07 Bump stocks and other methods of mimicking fully automatic fire are illegal. And suppressors are really not very silent at all.

5527 2018-02-20 03:28:31 That's not completely true. Janet Yellen wanted the Feds to buy stocks in anticipation of capital markets. We also had a very successful deleveraging campaign and taxing citizens to pay for things they use and will benefit is not an evil BUT excess is and that's a Pentagon budget
5528 2018-02-20 03:28:29 Rate of fire is the metric that judgements should be based. Whether auto or semi auto is irrelevant.

See: Vegas. Bump stocks.

The only way to have object argument without condescending people bc the use the wrong title for the type of weapon.
5529 2018-02-20 03:28:03 That, and high capacity magazines for anything but rimfire cartridges, bump-fire stocks, and comprehensive background checks for every single gun sold.  If you think you're going to radically change the gun laws overnight, then nothing will change at all.
5530 2018-02-20 03:27:39 AR-15s, high capacity magazines, bump stocks,
5531 2018-02-20 03:26:44 YES but many seem to still do it.

5533 2018-02-20 03:25:57 I’m just saying that I wouldn’t be opposed to it personally. NO ONE is trying to repeal 2A. NO ONE is coming for your guns. But it’s time the background checks were expanded and enhanced and things like bump stocks, which are designed to circumvent the law, are outlawed.
5534 2018-02-20 03:25:17 World stocks were set to post their first loss in five days on Monday, breaking a winning streak that saw them recover almost half their losses from a violent sell-off two weeks ago.
5535 2018-02-20 03:24:29 My time to give back.  People on this thread who are so certain this guy is nuts....listen up. Buying stocks that are moving up like AMZN or AAPL is a winning strategy.  Buying those that are moving down like GE and CMG is a losing strategy.  Buy low will get you into losers.
5536 2018-02-20 03:24:26 At any point Trump can sign an executive order about bump stocks, assault rifles, background checks or anything else he wants related to guns. Obama could have as well. Barring a constitutional challenge, Congress would have to pass a law that makes an executive order moot .
5537 2018-02-20 03:24:25 Also, AR’s without bump stocks have the potential of shooting 130-180 rounds per minute with extended clips - which are legal to purchase, as well.
5538 2018-02-20 03:23:07 The shooter in NV was a.) 1,100 feet away & still killed 58 people w/ all 23 guns legally purchased w/in 12 months; b.) point & shot w/out aiming carefully; c.) used AR’s w/ bump stocks which can shoot up to 9 rounds per second; d.) no diagnosed mental illnesses. You were saying?
5539 2018-02-20 03:20:54 yet job data is no improving... inflation is increasing... people are investing in metals due to uncertainty... stocks are taking a dip... u r living in a fools paradise...
5540 2018-02-20 03:20:53 Stocks-Short-term low due this week to early next cause slip. But thinking medium-term trend is up. Black Rock returned to bullish citing 4thqtr strength and tax cut.
5541 2018-02-20 03:20:33 @jasoninthehouse 'Tuan.. Prophet Obama had a super majority his first 2 years & did NOTHING on guns.
Obama's Admin authorized "bump stocks". Chicago has most gun control of any city & MOST KILLINGS
Final Chicago 2017 Totals
Shot-Killed 625
Do your homework and speak truthfully.

5543 2018-02-20 03:18:23 Despite thousand points advance last week,View any  decline as an opportunity to buy growth stocks.
5544 2018-02-20 03:18:05 Thats the issue without going in depth people are shorting the stocks :-)
5545 2018-02-20 03:18:01 When will congress discuss outlawing bump-stocks.
The Las Vegas shooting happened months ago.
5546 2018-02-20 03:17:53 Thanks! Is this good or bad for akao stocks?
5547 2018-02-20 03:17:42 I'm just waiting for @IngrahamAngle to come after you with a "Shut up and trade stocks" blast

5551 2018-02-20 03:16:02 Stocks crashed. Tell your friends to raise it back up. Get some whales to buy.
5552 2018-02-20 03:15:51 Better market advice for anytime: Buy stocks a mixture of low risk stocks don't look at them for 40 years after which point you should sell them when you need to.
5553 2018-02-20 03:15:49 I would be willing to compromise certain things like Bump Stocks, but anything else just hinders the people following the law....
5554 2018-02-20 03:15:43 Contact your State Rep and State Senator. A Virginia Court of Appeals upheld a Maryland Ban on assault weapons...it is not covered under right to bear arms Second Amendment!  I have emailed State and Federal A ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, gun show loopholes, bkgrnd cks

5556 2018-02-20 03:15:18 Avoid buying ADAG stocks
5557 2018-02-20 03:14:32 Far too little too late. These little bs tweaks to the background checks are not going to cut it. Ban the AR15, Bump Stocks and High Capacity magazines #wecallbs 
Take money from the @NRA any you are out in 2018 & 2020. @marcorubio and his blood money are 1st to go
5558 2018-02-20 03:14:21 How we doing on banning bump stocks Rob?

5560 2018-02-20 03:13:10 WTF? Do you REALLY think that Leftists r not using #FloridaShooting to confiscate guns? Why should pro 2A people give up any rights? The want a compromise. We will give Left expanded BG Checks & ban bump stocks. Gun owners get National Concealed Carry. #IamTheNRA
5561 2018-02-20 03:12:53 Gun stocks go down, mass shootings go up, push for more guns, people buy more guns, guns stocks go up. Wash, rinse and repeat.
5562 2018-02-20 03:12:35 You're right, of course. It has nothing to do with guns. It has everything to do with how easy it is for the mentally disturbed to get AR-15s and bump stocks.

5583 2018-02-20 03:07:18 It means we can ban bump stocks and 16-yr-olds can cancel their sufferage movement and go back to eating Tide pods.

5592 2018-02-20 03:03:55 Pretty close. The lot is recalled and companies required to institute packaging changes to defend against tampering. Sort of like banning bump stocks or requiring background checks or several other possible protections.
5593 2018-02-20 03:03:47 Wasn’t there a whole thing about banning bump stocks? I mean I realize they’re aren’t “guns” but it was seeking to control these things one attaches to guns that turn them into essentially automatic weapons… but yah ‘deep state’ buddy

5600 2018-02-20 03:00:33 From what history class and economic class has taught me is that the president very rarely has any actual effect on stocks....
5601 2018-02-20 03:00:14 Braun stocks up on community service "just in case"
5602 2018-02-20 03:00:04 They haven't turned their backs on stocks--just the brokers and the multitude of manipulators.
5603 2018-02-20 02:58:59 How’s it feel working for Russia this whole time comrade?Russian pawn!
5604 2018-02-20 02:58:54 Got to enforce those laws and bump stocks aren't needed.
5605 2018-02-20 02:57:57 Not sure why the global practice of halting of trading of stocks around big events/announcements is not followed in India!

5607 2018-02-20 02:56:52 A jury will decide that Sen Invertebrate @marcorubio. Donate the $3M in blood $$ you accepted from the #NRA for mental health counselling for the under/uninsured & support a Bill to ban AR15's & bump stocks while you're in the process-Earn that flippin 6+ figures we overpay you
5608 2018-02-20 02:56:19 Because it’s not just information, it is a commodity they trade in. Imagine if stock brokers told us openly how to spot good stocks. It’s not free information when you get paid for that opinion
5609 2018-02-20 02:56:17 Why would a "law abiding" person need an AR-15, bump stocks, 10 different rifles and 100 round magazines?
5610 2018-02-20 02:56:12 LoL  stocks are going down  haha
5611 2018-02-20 02:56:05 Our generation is not satisfied with stocks bc we don’t want to just beat inflation and we can’t buy Real Estate for pennies. 

All ‘real’ assets are already taken by boomers and we’re leading the way with digital ones. They’re our only option to take risks and change our lives.
5612 2018-02-20 02:55:20 RSI and time value in nifty are the two players who plays with Fire & sentiments of the people and it is waste of time and value instead one should go with investments in quality stocks it is the jugglery of NSE to keep busy the punters the whole day without any purpose.
5613 2018-02-20 02:54:43 Every TOM ,DICK saying on #Bluechannels

Everyday they use same words:

1)Bull Market is intact in India

2)This is Bull Market correction 

3)If fall by 10-15% -No worry

4)Every Dip has to be bought

5)Buy Growth story stocks (Like ? )

6)PNB like issue -small things

Blah Blah
5614 2018-02-20 02:54:25 BUT U didnt bc that's not what the rulset declares the winner as, the game isn't about winning neutral or racking up % it's about taking your opponents 2 stocks before they take yours
5615 2018-02-20 02:54:25 If you are confident of indian growth story then buy blue chip stocks like Eicher Motors, infrastructure stocks, PSU banks. I will.
5616 2018-02-20 02:54:08 Bump stocks are illegal along with the bump stock modification.
5617 2018-02-20 02:53:54 When will these liberals ever learn. Guns = Safety! Gun free zones promote death. Its time to act and to right the wrong fro our country. Bump stocks were not in Vegas. A sign can't stop bullets. Muslims are not our friends. Wake up! Start the draft! Make snowflakes into men!
5618 2018-02-20 02:52:59 Yes, you don't need bump stocks to hunt deer.
5619 2018-02-20 02:51:42 It will be a small markets.  Indians are big on gold.  Most of them don't even buy stocks.  Crypto will be traded among 2% in the next 2-3 years
5620 2018-02-20 02:51:42 Stop attacking the media ((AG)) - it’s the easiest thing in the world to do - and address the issue directly with your own position, on bump stocks and AR-15’s for example. You’re the “informed” one. Tell us what you propose!

Shut up! 

#TrollTrump
5623 2018-02-20 02:50:02 March! Demand action. Enough!
No assault rifles!
Universal Background Checks!
No Bump Stocks!
No large Magazines!
No Cop-killer Bullets!

Sadly, none of this will END gun violence. But by God, it will REDUCE gun violence!
5624 2018-02-20 02:49:38 Especially with Williams track record of losing things lol
5625 2018-02-20 02:49:04 Mr. President thank you for good economy but please seize the moment and end the sale of semi-automatic weapons and 30 round magazines and I worked at Beretta USA. There is no need for bump stocks or these type of weapons they are intended for massive casualties. Please we beg.
5626 2018-02-20 02:48:51 「実績」には"track record" が使われます。また、人間以外にも使うことが可能。
These stocks have a proven track record.
この株は実績が証明されている。
5627 2018-02-20 02:48:28 There is zero effort made by regulator to guide investors that these stocks have no value.
5628 2018-02-20 02:48:23 “None of these...fire more than one round with a single trigger pull.”
And as a matter of fact, the @NRA stated on Oct 5 that bump stocks and similar devices should be subject to additional regulations and called upon regulators to investigate if the devices follow federal law.
5629 2018-02-20 02:48:11 parang gusto kong bumili ng stocks lol
5630 2018-02-20 02:47:35 If you bought PSU bank stocks after recap news (30-60% higher), the fault lies with the investor. Similarly, if you are buying NCLT reference case stocks which have ZERO chance to get any residual value, you are repeating the same mistake as an investor.
5631 2018-02-20 02:46:50 1. Agree
2. Agree with exemption for those requesting protective order or have just been victimized.
3.  Once you limit magazine capacity & eliminate bump stocks (learn about binary triggers!  DM me if you need) the rifle is fine.  Don't over-reach!
5632 2018-02-20 02:46:29 Sir  this not panic selling.. It is well planned selling keeping hdfc bank/Ril to manage index.. And sector/stock specific selling.. SOME banks /stocks r hardly down few Rs
5633 2018-02-20 02:45:30 Have you considered investing in a pressure cooker? It compounds your stocks at an interesting rate.

5635 2018-02-20 02:45:08 What are your thoughts?  I'm fine with current gun laws, minus bump stocks.
5636 2018-02-20 02:42:55 Until Trump, we were also the highest office in the world. Now we are just laughing stocks. Nice job Trump. I never thought in 1 million years I could see our country virtually destroyed in 13 months without weapons of mass distraction.
5637 2018-02-20 02:42:16 It means its time now jab ye stocks bhi double honge ... what do u say ... 
any specific stock in this list
5638 2018-02-20 02:42:09 No more rapid than any semi pistol. A single fire for every trigger pull. I'd do away with bump stocks myself, but you are misinformed. Become informed instead of repeating rhetoric.
5639 2018-02-20 02:41:22 @BillGalvano Just how, exactly, would a ban on bump stocks have prevented this shooting?  Why is it you feel a need to restrict law abiding citizens rights instead of defending them??

5650 2018-02-20 02:35:57 YOU ARE THE "WORST PRESIDENT" we ever had, by NOT dealing with GUN VIOLENCE in our Country.

Talk about stocks.
Talk about the economy.

But YOU CAN'T TALK about the 17 dead  children, just because the NRA lined your election pockets.

Guess what?
New DAY COMMING!
5651 2018-02-20 02:35:35 Remember when we bought Agfeed stocks at Vail office ? What's the next agfeed? I want to buy something
5652 2018-02-20 02:35:05 Speaking of naive, what's a "bump stick"? You don't even know of what you speak and you act morally superior.  
Incidentally, NRA supported focused Bump StOck legislation... Grandstanding notwithstanding, no AR15+Bump Stocks in mass shoots before Vegas. 
Can't just make up facts
5653 2018-02-20 02:34:41 Yeah and the only difference that it has between the military version is that it is semi automatic. And we have already seen how bump stocks and its high rate of semi automatic fire any way from low recoil and hair triggers  negate that difference.
5654 2018-02-20 02:34:36 People are getting laid off. Companies are buying back stocks. Companies are still going out of country. Even your own junk is still not being made in US. If you really believed this why don't you bring your stuff home?
5655 2018-02-20 02:34:23 It struck me that in the latest drawdown many “Growth” stocks were being priced like relative safe-havens. When it comes to GOOG, AAPL, FB, MSFT, and AMZN, the conventional wisdom about high growth stocks and market volatility may be shifting...
5656 2018-02-20 02:33:34 Exactly. 
Isreal has  had armed protection at schools for years, but i bet these people against all but gun laws don't want to hear that either, 
If something works why not at least research it.
AR15, and bump stocks should not be sold to public.
5657 2018-02-20 02:32:57 I went back to my stocks to see where I should have sold them vs where I sold them.. @PhilakoneCrypto YouTube tutorials all started making much more sense
5658 2018-02-20 02:32:44 CLSA ON INDIA IT SERVICES
Indian mid-cap IT stocks continue to outperform larger peers and are now trading at a premium
struggle to find value in midcaps and prefer large-caps over midcaps, with Infosys and HCLT as key BUYs.
5659 2018-02-20 02:32:39 The issue is not mental illness.  The issue is ppl running around with Assault Rifles.  Period.  Oh, and bump stocks.  @NRA @realDonaldTrump. Please don’t say ppl kill, not guns.  That’s like saying Nukes don’t kill, just ppl.
5660 2018-02-20 02:32:21 As of 10:30 a.m., PSEi 8,642.14 down 68.08 points or 0.78 percent.  #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks

5662 2018-02-20 02:31:32 I think this can be solved by the complete ban of bump stocks and also putting more resources into the police force across the country. 2/2
5663 2018-02-20 02:31:06 America has put more regulations into a bottle of beer during Prohibition & dry states than with bump stocks last year.
5664 2018-02-20 02:29:20 Used to put money into crypto and stocks based on company reputation and products .. but @PhilakoneCrypto made me want to learn TA. He is a true master of his art ..may his tribe grow .. he has lit the candle in me.. and I hope I can pass it along
5665 2018-02-20 02:29:04 That’s what he said about bump stocks. Nothing happened.
5666 2018-02-20 02:28:55 What to do sir .. Not all women want stocks as gifts. They want diamond too.
5667 2018-02-20 02:28:46 Naw, it’s actually much more simple:
1) reduce # of guns by 100 million/year for 3 years,going to ONLY 200 million;
2)prohibit silencers,mags>15 rounds;
3)prohibit bump stocks, ARs, any long fun that can be machined to go full auto;
4)prohibit jacketed rounds;
     1)
5668 2018-02-20 02:28:23 Forget bump stocks fit all assault rifles with an air bag that ejects the shooter in anyplace other then a war zone.
5669 2018-02-20 02:26:50 These stocks are the traditional version of Bitcoin and we have been trading them since ages now, and they call Bitcoin an invention..!

5672 2018-02-20 02:24:59 and yet its still a thing that should be done because

and i cannot possibly understand why i have to stress this so hard

BUMP STOCKS ONLY EXIST TO TURN SEMI AUTO WEAPONS FULL AUTO BECAUSE FULL AUTO WEAPONS ARE ILLEGAL
5673 2018-02-20 02:24:40 Magazines really don't need to go over 20 or 30 and bump stocks should be illegal federally. As somebody that owns a precision rifle based on the AR-15 platform.
5674 2018-02-20 02:23:30 My life is not diminished because I don't have an AR-15. But, we  all need clean air to breath and clean water to drink. Ban assault rifles and bump stocks permanently.
5675 2018-02-20 02:23:27 He hasn’t sold and bought back. It was always top 5 stocks. You may check every six month, portfolio to get quick data
5676 2018-02-20 02:22:02 Indian markets would fall continuously,this is not a bull market small stocks could be zero, shorts should be converted into buy
5677 2018-02-20 02:21:57 The same is possible in a lot many f&o stocks.

5680 2018-02-20 02:19:45 Why is having a discussion about fact tired? Look at bump stock bill after vegas. Dems added language which would expwnd far beyond bump stocks. Everyone including GOP & Pres said they would ban bump stocks however aftrr added language that ended it. Look it up
5681 2018-02-20 02:18:48 @realDonaldTrump  Hey Cadet Bone Spurs!
Ban military-style assault rifles. Ban high capacity magazines. Ban bump stocks. Do your job. Try to Keep America Great. Stop being so pathetic. Sad.
5682 2018-02-20 02:18:02 Wigan stocks slip after European surge fades, dollar edges up
5683 2018-02-20 02:17:34 we have larger scams of stock market than diamond industry. Investors are trapped in stocks with high price, operator play games & shares become penny shares. Investors disappear. shell companies listed. should we ban share market too? No. you cannot paint all with one color.
5684 2018-02-20 02:17:28 For the record, I think bump stocks should be much more regulated than they are now. But this deliberate misinformation you are spreading by saying AR-15s are fully automatic does nothing to help your cause.
5685 2018-02-20 02:17:08 Lots of dangerous things REGULATED for the common good like lawn darts, kinder toys and drink driving. No hunter uses or needs AR 15s, silencers, or bump stocks. The NRA promotes a narrative of anarchy & fear to support the need for  weapons of war. #GunReformNow

5687 2018-02-20 02:16:56 NRA wants us talking about background checks,bump stocks,etc. Not real gun control. 

Elect legislators that are not beholden to the NRA and take control of the argument.

GUN CONTROL = GUN ELIMINATION            

#RepealThe2nd @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @SenateDems
5688 2018-02-20 02:16:35 I own firearms, a Walther PPQ M1 & aMossberg Patriot. No desire to own an AR but friends do and I’ve worked on them with them (swapping out BCG, replacing stocks and installing flat triggers with shorter resets). I’m not gun naive. And I agree with you, no one should own one
5689 2018-02-20 02:16:06 Let's not pretend that his platform is wildly supportive of gun control, it's not.... Even the NRA supported banning bump stocks after Vegas.
5690 2018-02-20 02:15:17 Yea I don’t get that, you motivate me to look for stocks to buy! Must be talkin about the wrong redhead lol

5693 2018-02-20 02:14:40 And also I will use my new strategy. This strategy is not for the list of stocks I will watch tomorrow.
5694 2018-02-20 02:14:22 You're on the right side of it though. There are a lot of people in conservative media that will be gone or laughing stocks in 2-5 years. You will be clean of record and conscience.
5695 2018-02-20 02:14:08 The NRA should come out in support of a common sense gun control bill and get ahead of the curve on this. Bump stocks, close background check loopholes( that can be enforced) and reinstate the assault weapons ban. It may not help much, but it’s a start. Be proactive.
5696 2018-02-20 02:13:24 These also the stocks I will watch tomorrow 
$TTPH Watching for bounce . 
$LPCN Watching for breakout
$AMDA  Watching for Bounce, I know this has a huge red bar.
$MOSY You know I need a nice news to expect a nice spike.

5703 2018-02-20 02:09:07 You guys really think bump stocks are what decides if people are going to go shoot up a school?
5704 2018-02-20 02:08:51 1) it’s not. 2) bump stocks are meaningless.  3) how do you determine mental competency without violating HIPAA?  4) Hillary is your avatar...she’s responsible for the deaths of more innocent people than any shooter. Don’t be selectively outraged.
5705 2018-02-20 02:07:55 Allison has the maturity of the kids she is interviewing, NRA is a organization supported by legal gun owners
 The criminals and school shooters are not #NRA members and likely don't know what #NRA stands for. 
 AR15 or bump stocks do not need to be sold publicly.  CALL CONGRESS
5706 2018-02-20 02:06:59 Stocks Rising.... Planes About To Take Off.... You On It Or Not?
5707 2018-02-20 02:06:54 Bump stocks? Nah.
Improve background checks? At gun shows? Online? Nope.
Protect gun makers? Sure!
Restrict terror watchlist? Mental illness?
Maintain an assault weapon ban that WORKED? Oh, hell no!

If you want to drain the swamp, ya gotta pull that @NRA plug!
5708 2018-02-20 02:06:38 taking your talking points from #Trump - everyone & everything else is to blame but the #ComplicitGOP which has loosened gun regulations and done nothing to make registration and waiting periods stronger, get rid of bump stocks or AR-15 - good only for people quickly #SHAMEonYou
5709 2018-02-20 02:04:18 ...an incident of organizational failure is not the same thing as decades of lobbying (backed by serious cash) that effectively precludes some elected officials from voting for basic common sense protections (i.e. banning bump stocks, ARs, etc...). (2/2)
5710 2018-02-20 02:03:38 The wealth disparity has gotten so bad, we need to go beyond merely taxing income & start taxing the assets of the top .01% by net worth. If the .01% try to evade asset taxes, don't jail anyone; just start seizing their yachts, land, stocks & simply change ownership to the public
5711 2018-02-20 02:03:04 1. How about not selling guns to people with mental illness?
2. No bump stocks allowed 
3. No lobbying from NRA will help out a LOT.
4. No tanks, no artillery, no mortar, no machine guns

Yes handguns, rifles and shotguns!
5712 2018-02-20 02:03:02 On bump stocks. We never should have let the ban on assault rifles to lapse (thanks, Republicans /sarcasm)
5713 2018-02-20 02:02:52 780 ko lang nabili. Pero nung bumalik ako kahapon wala na akong nakita bundle ng maze runner. Naghahanap kasi ako ng percy jackson bundle kaso out of stocks pa rin

5718 2018-02-20 02:01:39 Oh yeah, like this?
"President Trump and the National Rifle Association got behind the push for outlawing “bump stocks” Thursday, giving rare momentum to gun control legislation in response to the Las Vegas massacre"
Funny thing, the Internet never forgets.
5719 2018-02-20 02:01:38 I’ve got two in public schools not far from there but heaven forbid we touch any laws ... like why do people on terrorist watch lists need to legally buy guns, or what is the purpose of legal bump stocks, or extended magazines?
5720 2018-02-20 02:00:04 Why then is the AR-15 the weapon of choice for nearly all mass shootings? 

Could you agree with setting lower limits on magazine size? How about bump stocks? 

What about reinstating the restrictions on people who aren't mentally competent - the restrictions that Trump removed?
5721 2018-02-20 01:58:56 If you mean they gotta defend their cattle from wildlife: There aren't all that many grizzlies around. Not even that many wolves. You don't need an M16 to hunt fox and coyote; prolly not even an AR-15. I'd guess a .22 will do. And bump stocks, 30-shot mags etc...? Be serious. /2
5722 2018-02-20 01:58:38 Are you insinuating that jesus is pro ar-15s and bump stocks? Jesus is pro giant ammo clips?

5724 2018-02-20 01:58:27 Oh, I get what you mean about carnage. I read something basically saying that the difference is huge, like from completely tearing a liver to shreds with one  and making a small hole with the other. I don't want to see either! I agree that bump stocks are completely unnecessary.

@COLFinancial
5728 2018-02-20 01:57:28 Because of the GOP.  So now that they are in charge where 99% take NRA $. Trump reversed mental health reporting   Less see what they come up with ball in their court still haven’t banned bump stocks #GunReformNow
5729 2018-02-20 01:57:06 But, it is becoming increasingly difficult to justify easy access to that particular type of weapon, for which bump stocks are easily accessible like for the Vegas shooter.  Harder still since an 18 year old was able to go out and grab one so readily.

5732 2018-02-20 01:54:30 Unemployment was dropped under Obama, stop talking about that.  Stocks are meaningless to 99% of Americans, manufacturing jobs were never low (if you were in the field, you’d know that) and that tax cuts for us peons will disappear while the rich keep theirs.

Keep dreaming :)

5735 2018-02-20 01:53:02 Settle down deer sleiher. Nobody wants your guns.. well maybe just your automatic weapons and any bump stocks you might have laying around
5736 2018-02-20 01:52:15 Why doesn’t the UK have this problem Scott? They don’t have guns or school massacres. Stop blaming this on mental illness as you just look stupid. We have to get rid of the AR’s, bump stocks, bullet proof vests etc...you can’t run into a school and kill 17 with a knife.

5746 2018-02-20 01:44:31 Au contraire, it is precisely when the Fed is forced to print trillions more dollars to monetize USTs that no one else wants (ECB) and likely municipal, corp, student, and ABS debt while buying stocks (BoJ) that ends the dollar's reign as the GRC. Only a matter of time. 2020/21.
5747 2018-02-20 01:44:20 I'm also fine with getting rid of bump stocks, but "high capacity magazines" are anything over 10 rounds and I'm fine with those.
5748 2018-02-20 01:43:48 ... this isn’t a problem with a single fix. But it’s very obvious to me (as the original tweet said) that things like bump stocks, high capacity magazines and assault weapons (weapons with no legit hunting or self defense purpose) should be banned.
5749 2018-02-20 01:43:34 Like stocks falling? JPY and CNY (w/ capital controls) seem good either way.

5752 2018-02-20 01:42:27 My stocks earned record gains this year. Lovin it!!
5753 2018-02-20 01:42:26 I hope this "modest bill"won't be to Parkland what talk of bump stocks were to Vegas-nothing but more empty words & broken promises wrapped in thoughts & prayers. Somehow~I dont think these Students Survivors are going to settle for continued congressional unaccountability.
5754 2018-02-20 01:41:52 Ban the manufacture of semiautomatic weapons, bump stocks, ghost guns and ammunition for them, for sale to public. In other words roll back portion of Brady Bill that was not renewed. Accept nothing less. Enough. NRA owns our legislators.
5755 2018-02-20 01:40:54 State legislated gun control has worked in CT, post Sandy Hook. Gun laws can prohibit manufacturing automatic weapons for personal use, bump stocks, and unreasonable ammo purchases. For a start.
5756 2018-02-20 01:40:47 Crunch time for quality stocks to get back over there 50day ma should be doable if markets behave for a few weeks

5764 2018-02-20 01:35:06 I'll believe it when I see it. new GOP M.O.: head fake intent to pass reform, wait a few days or weeks, abandon reform, wait a few more days and introduce more regulatory erosion. Las Vegas -> fake interest in outlawing bump stocks -> abandon -> fight for interstate reciprocity

5767 2018-02-20 01:34:20 Time to bring "bump stocks" back up and Congress needs to ban them or get out of Congress and go work for the NRA because come Nov if u don't ban assault weapons & bump stocks the tax payers will not pay u to represent them n Congress, HAD ENOUGH, Your seat not for sale to NRA.

5774 2018-02-20 01:28:59 you should make a custom pack with stocks you'd made because it'd probably sell
5775 2018-02-20 01:27:59 A week of training, f/up, guns stored separate from ammo, no multiple round magazines/ bump stocks, no homemade guns, no military style weapons, no arsenals, heavy penalties for parents whose children get their hands on their guns, thorough anger testing, research white men anger
5776 2018-02-20 01:27:56 Same we thought abt pharma few months back but it's still in same zone..No doubt bank stocks in oversold range currently & a bounce back is due anytime.
5777 2018-02-20 01:27:42 I'm a gun owner. There's no doubt in my mind that we should:

1) Require universal background checks
2) Mandate a 48 hour waiting period for purchases
3) Ban military-style assault rifles, along with accessories like high-capacity magazines and bump stocks

This is common sense.
5778 2018-02-20 01:27:34 Stocks not cool
5779 2018-02-20 01:26:30 gun control is something as simple as requiring intense background, physical and mental checks, gun control is something as simple as making bump stocks illegal gun control is not taking away all guns

5783 2018-02-20 01:23:41 We can have a discussion but you feigning ignorance as to why a sale of bump-stocks using a promo code of MAGA could be considered in poor taste, tone deaf, obnoxious, and in general offensive does not make an actual exchange of ideas seem promising

5791 2018-02-20 01:19:49 Awesome article. Thank you.

It's a small victory, but we managed to ban the bump stocks in Washington state and I've heard a few other state successes. I'm an Independent, but agree that the Dems can do better & bigger. I'll take any start going somewhere, though!
5792 2018-02-20 01:19:45 Full assault weapon is automatic weapon . Firearm companies came up with new guns called a semi assault which will only fire 1 time 1 pull of the trigger but  an accessory "bump stocks" which can allow a semi-automatic rifle to mimic a fully automated weapon
5793 2018-02-20 01:19:43 A stronger dollar typically increases the value of health care and consumer discretionary stocks. A weaker dollar has the same outcome for energy and material stocks.
5794 2018-02-20 01:19:23 I don't think 48 hours is long enough. 21 days. In addition to a full psychological workup. 

But I also don't think semi-automatic rifles with pistol grips are the root. 

Bump stocks, magazines with greater than 10 rounds... I can see the overhauled regulations needed.
5795 2018-02-20 01:19:00 But with a bump stock.... I actually don't like bump stocks; I find them scary, like I'm not sure if you tried one but I feel like it would be easy to lose control; I don't like that feeling at all.
5796 2018-02-20 01:18:25 I appreciate how my mom stocks up on stuff even when she doesn't need them, because she knows we'll need them eventually!!! Like how I needed triple A batteries today for my calculator and she just happened to have some in her closet! Bless her

5803 2018-02-20 01:15:12 Talking about banning assault weapons, bump stocks, high count magazines, universal background checks, are not the same as taking away guns. Well meaning, concerned gun owners should be leading this charge, against the carnage. It is the ignorance of the knowledgable that kills.
5804 2018-02-20 01:14:47 If you knew anything about actually shooting, you would not care about bump stocks in the least.
5805 2018-02-20 01:14:42 Your 3rd point has a serious issue. 'Military-style assault rifles' is an almost non-sensical use of language and 'high-capacity magazines' is a null issue (a 10 round box-mag can be reloaded just as quickly as a 30 round box-mag). However, bump-stocks are just plain daft.
5806 2018-02-20 01:14:38 There are many law abiding gun owners who are responsible and can hunt and protect themselves if that is their choice.  But often law abiding gun owners are law abiding until they aren’t...and when they turn, I don’t want them to have AR-15s and bump stocks!
5807 2018-02-20 01:13:57 Agree. In fact your tweet is eerily similar to mine from yesterday:

Idea: treat guns like cars & regulate 'em.
background checks
protection orders
ban sales 2 under-21s
require safe storage
ban straw purchases
ban bump stocks
research for 'smart guns'
5808 2018-02-20 01:13:21 Stock normally has a fuller flavor than broth because it’s cooked longer. Also, most stocks are seasoned more than a broth. Hope that helps.
5809 2018-02-20 01:12:30 No idea.. lol, but stocks like this do amazing things.. and shit happens behind the scenes that we can't fully understand.. it's a lotto with potential, "circle of life stock".. it'll come.. getting in early has draw backs such as waiting..
5810 2018-02-20 01:11:50 @SpeakerRyan  as if on Q says it isn't time to get political about gun control.The majority of Americans want gun reform including banning all assault rifles,background checks on private sales,ban bump stocks,but you r the one making this political,that's why you'll be voted out!
5811 2018-02-20 01:11:28 Why do you want to ban background checks? I agree with everything you said besides the bump stocks unless you have a great reason.
5812 2018-02-20 01:11:15 Not to sure on the details tbh but I think she only owns a small portion of their stocks?? So there are higher-ups above her I think.
5813 2018-02-20 01:10:44 Really hoping to see some legislation that addresses AR-15s, bump stocks, and high capacity mags. Guns have changed; it’s time gun laws address that. 
Grateful you’re leading the conversation. Keep the whole GOP accountable. Our kids are counting on it.
5814 2018-02-20 01:09:31 You see, guns themselves aren’t the problem. High powered guns with large magazines and bump stocks are the problem. High powered killing weapons which serve no purpose other than mass murder. I’m a gun owner. I’m not against guns, just the access and to what kind.
5815 2018-02-20 01:09:28 And....Ban bump stocks and similar devices. Increase the age for gun purchases to 21. All gun transactions require background checks., even private.
5816 2018-02-20 01:08:46 potential stampede out of stocks into bonds.

5819 2018-02-20 01:07:02 NRA lobbies for easier access to guns. Easier access to bump stocks and silencers and other stuff than really go beyond the need to protect yourself and your family or to hunt.
5820 2018-02-20 01:06:48 @billgalvano I really like the sounds of this: raise age to purchase firearms to 21, create wtg period for buying, ban bump stocks & create gun-violence ROs.  #Parkland #SandyHook #GunControlNow @realDonaldTrump
5821 2018-02-20 01:06:35 @ConorLambPA I support you and I want you to win, I think you won the debate by a landslide but in addition to fixing the loopholes in the background check system we need to ban AR-15’s & bump stocks #PA18
5822 2018-02-20 01:06:19 Congress needs to ban high-capacity magazines. To ban bump stocks alone is not sufficient--there are other products on the market that work the same. Banning AR-15s alone is not sufficient--some guns are the same. Regulate the size of the clip to 5 bullets for ALL guns.
5823 2018-02-20 01:06:08 You pick stocks yourself?
5824 2018-02-20 01:05:54 We MUST 1) Require universal comprehensive background checks for ALL sales/transfers of ALL firearms 2) Mandate 7 day waiting period for ALL sales/transfers 3)Ban the sale of ALL military-style assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc END the MADNESS-SAVE lives!!

5826 2018-02-20 01:04:50 British retailers are so dishonest.  House of Fraser stocks men's suits by "Turner & Sanderson of London".  There is no such company, no searchable content anywhere inc. companies house.  It's blatantly a phoney brand, probably made in sweatshops by kids...
5827 2018-02-20 01:04:45 You are preaching to the choir about proper background checks and restrictions on bump stocks which can turn a semi automatic gun into a fully automatic. I am not  sure how familiar you are with AR 15's, but they are nothing more that a low powered rifle that I would use to.
5828 2018-02-20 01:04:37 Waiting periods. Background checks.  No bump stocks.  Magazine size limits.  Rate of fire limits.  Tracking and licensing.  Training requirements.  PLEASE.
5829 2018-02-20 01:04:32 I thought AK47's were banned for use by civilians and that the AR15s - with or without bump stocks were the ones used in the mass shootings.
5830 2018-02-20 01:04:28 Making money on a stock isn’t a use case. Cryptos can make money & have use cases. Legacy system like stocks and bonds are dying. Bonds better than Cryptos to absorb larger amounts of capital (currently) but that’s it. I’ll throw rocks

5845 2018-02-20 00:55:22 Summary from this: Best way to make money from cryptos is buying alt providers stocks. For example: Not one golddigger made money in Klondike as much as pickax sellers.
5846 2018-02-20 00:54:36 Extensive backgrounds checks are band-aid, non-solution. Ban sale of weapons made for war including Ar15 and bump stocks. Civilians don't need. NRA protects gun manufacturers profits over lives as do Republicans bought by nra. @Emma4Change was right when she did the math.
5847 2018-02-20 00:54:25 1) Nikolas Cruz had no criminal record and bought his guns legally, so UBC ineffective and irrelevant. Most mass killers are 1st time criminals. 
2) Stephen Paddock patiently planned his massacre over several months.
3) There is broad support in banning bump stocks, but how?

5849 2018-02-20 00:53:35 Bump stocks are a waste. They make the weapon less accurate and therefore less effective.

5853 2018-02-20 00:48:56 Trump is “open to improving background checks” for potential buyers of guns.  After speaking to his sons and Geraldo Rivera.  Gun control experts that they are.  This is a completely joke, right?? He/Congress need to BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS and BUMP STOCKS.
5854 2018-02-20 00:48:36 Not if you have carefully invested in chosen stocks
5855 2018-02-20 00:48:14 The first step will be banning automatic weapons & bump stocks that turn semi-auto to auto. That should come soon after the mid-terms, if not before. It will be much harder getting handguns off the street, but if NYC can lower crime so much, the rest of the US should be able to.
5856 2018-02-20 00:47:59 Eliot, I think we can pass laws where we agree without jeopardizing our right to own a gun.  It is healthy to fear slippery slopes to ensure it doesn’t go too far but not healthy when it stops us from acting on the things that make sense such outlawing bump stocks.
5857 2018-02-20 00:47:09 How about the fact that a troubled 18 year old could legally purchase an AR-15?? Why should anyone other then that police and military need to own an AR-15? Ban them, ban bump stocks, ban high capacity magazines. Close background check loopholes. Ignore the NRA agenda.
5858 2018-02-20 00:46:27 Sorry, Brasilmagic. I usually agree w/you, but absolutely NO to under 21 drinking or pot. (I like pot.) But yes to 21 for handguns, with comprehensive background checks! No to assault rifles, stocks, etc.
5859 2018-02-20 00:45:30 I would say to just invest in stocks, thats less volatile than crypto but thats just me... Also I do have a suggestion if your up for that...
5860 2018-02-20 00:44:16 Excellent advice. These kind of stocks may not give any excitement but, they are compounders. No better financial gift for next generation. Thank you for enlightenment..
5861 2018-02-20 00:44:04 Forget immigration four pillars and focus on guns. Four pillars- ban assault weapons, 21 to buy gun, universal background checks, ban bump stocks.

5863 2018-02-20 00:43:02 Your grammar amuses me, but your ideas do not.  Bump stocks should be illegal.  Big magazines also.  Licenses mandatory.  Gun shows closed down.  Waiting periods required.  Simple fixes.
5864 2018-02-20 00:42:54 I'm a gun owner. There's no doubt in my mind that we should:

1) Require universal background checks
2) Mandate a 48 hour waiting period for purchases

5869 2018-02-20 00:40:15 I don’t think anybody wants to do that.  They just want AR15’s and bump stocks and the like made illegal.  Background checks where the background is literally checked. No sales where you walk in and out with a gun.  None of this is unreasonable.
5870 2018-02-20 00:40:15 Did he pull an Obama and make bump stocks legal, an anti gun law move, thus killing 50+ people in Vegas. ALL BLOOD on Obamas hand. Or when Obama gave assault rifles to Mexican drug lords which were then used to kill THOUSANDS of citizens and 1 AMERICAN. Obama loves murder

5889 2018-02-20 00:24:37 Sure, get rid of bump stocks. But what guns? Pistols (97% of murders) or rifles (3%)? Or only those used in crimes? So if someone uses a Glock 43, we put Glock 43s on the list?
5890 2018-02-20 00:23:27 We are on the same page this thing gets thin af over .02
5891 2018-02-20 00:23:26 Just like the bump stocks after Vegas 
5892 2018-02-20 00:23:20 92% of gun owners support universal background checks, as do 86% of republicans

83% of Dems and 49% of Republicans support stricter gun laws

79% of voters support banning bump stocks

87% support banning gun sales to mentally unfit people
5893 2018-02-20 00:22:44 How about just get rid of the guns and bump stocks they’ve been using for these mass murders. That’s a good place to start and if it lowers the numbers, that’s enough.
5894 2018-02-20 00:22:35 This isn’t about democrats or republicans it’s about common sense !  Let’s use it !           1. Metal detectors in every school.                  2. Officer Armed at the front as kids arrive       3. NO selling of semi automatic rifles , bump stocks etc Any longer
5895 2018-02-20 00:21:27 I'm a gun owner. There's no doubt in my mind that we should:

1) Require universal background checks
2) Mandate a 48 hour waiting period for purchases
3) Ban military-style assault rifles, along with accessories like high-capacity magazines and bump stocks

This is common sense.
5896 2018-02-20 00:19:48 Because hedge funds & short sellers force #stocks 2 over react. It's the ugly side of the business where the hedge fund can make up 4 all their blunders. For naked shorts They take advantage regardless of who gets hurt, get all i can while i can attitude. If you get hurt so what
5897 2018-02-20 00:19:30 Oh ya man it's the name of the game . If u can't pick stocks and keep losing . Why not bash someone that is . Love it . Just shows I am winning . What anyone posts about a stock has no effect. It's up to the market .
5898 2018-02-20 00:18:46 Marijuana stocks 
5899 2018-02-20 00:18:30 As a general note, I find GDX harder to track than GC because it's a Frankenstein's monster of individual stocks rather than its own entity. That being said, my forecast sees a new low ~$19.30-.80 ~3/7. Bounce this week, down 2 weeks, then nice strong rally back up. Follow the GC
5900 2018-02-20 00:18:17 We are out of Time!!! It is not an either/Or!!! We can multitask, you’ve heard of the word I’m sure!!! Enforce the laws AND get rid of bump stocks and semi automatics NOW.
5901 2018-02-20 00:18:11 That is not the best way to end 'mass' shootings, it's a start and a good one at that, but Las Vegas shooter had no warning signs. Banning AR-15s and its variants, round drums, slide stocks, tracer and combustible ammunitions. Is a good way to end killings in 'mass'
5902 2018-02-20 00:18:01 Wigan stocks dip after European surge fades, dollar firm
5903 2018-02-20 00:17:59 Stocks are garbage. Fiat is garbage. At some point someone has to figure out that inflation compensation is not wealth building.
5904 2018-02-20 00:17:16 If u can't convince urself "when I'm down 25%,im a buyer" Nd banish forever"when I'm down 25%,I'm a seller" thn U will never make a decent profit in stocks.- Peter Lynch
5905 2018-02-20 00:16:32 @realdonaldtrump, u treated Hillary Rohdam Clinton as though she were a witch who needed to b put n the stocks n twn sq.

Ur deplorable!
5906 2018-02-20 00:16:20 The GOP does nothing about common sense safe gun legislation.....what happen with the gun stocks? They did nothing...Trump signed legislation allowing the mentally ill to buy a weapons...now that's SAD
5907 2018-02-20 00:16:20 also bump stocks make a gun extremely inaccurate and you don’t actually even need a bump stock to bump fire
5908 2018-02-20 00:15:05 I have not forgotten the recent #market storm. My seatbelt remains fastened tight. #investing #stocks #bonds #inflation #FED
5909 2018-02-20 00:14:32 An assault rifle is fully automatic- these are highly regulated already and one has never been used in a mass shooting. High-cap magazines are also rarely used. 30 is standard cap. Bump-stocks are a joke. You can bump fire without one, but it would be less effective than aiming.
5910 2018-02-20 00:13:54 I’ve always taken the position that buying other equities will reduce my exposure to certain other stocks as my portfolio grows, a natural rebalance. Have a tough time selling a laggard, I just don’t buy more of it.
5911 2018-02-20 00:12:25 Stocks don’t trade stocks, people trade stocks..
5912 2018-02-20 00:12:12 Shootings & the need for a changes in gun laws isn't new. After Vegas the big discussion was bump stocks. After the news died down I didn't hear anymore about it. When these tragedies happen ppl want changes but drop the ball. It'll be a challenge
5913 2018-02-20 00:11:46 So what your saying MS is 13 year old's are no longer the largest investors in stocks?

5915 2018-02-20 00:11:01 Once again, our children have been slaughtered. And 
@SlideFireSol offers BUMP STOCKS - you know, like the Las Vegas shooter used - on SPECIAL for President's Day. The sale code? #MAGA There is NO humanity let alone morality in this bunch.
5916 2018-02-20 00:10:45 #ICO have a potential hidden, for sure. Way much riskier than penny stocks. With just a couple of champs to discover. #NXT
5917 2018-02-20 00:10:41 Law [X] wouldn’t prevent [name a massacre]. But what if bump stocks had been banned years ago? Paddock still would’ve gotten all the guns he wanted. But what if instead of 58 deaths it was 40? I think those 18 families would consider that significant.
5918 2018-02-20 00:10:33 Jared is going to have to do some localised stretching exercises,  & invest in lube stocks.
5919 2018-02-20 00:10:24 Let this decade show once more how the young can alter the course of history!   No more assault weapons, no bump stocks, no large magazines, less concealed carry permits, digitized  ownership records readily available to law enforcement!
5920 2018-02-20 00:10:03 You can keep your 2nd amendment. I want assault rifles, bump stocks banned. I also want the gun show loop hole closed. I want longer & better background checks. It’s all good until yours is shot
5921 2018-02-20 00:09:52 @Arightside so what penny stocks are you currently buying??
5922 2018-02-20 00:09:18 Laaaame out of all the stocks to win, I got Sprint worth $5 lmaooooo im a fuckin joke
5923 2018-02-20 00:07:47 Topix index rose 2.2% Monday, biggest gain since Jan. 4; MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.8%; stocks in Europe fell while U.S. was closed for a holiday
5924 2018-02-20 00:07:36 because stocks are rigged
5925 2018-02-20 00:07:05 Bump stocks need to be banned as well.
5926 2018-02-20 00:06:51 Stocks bounce back. Look at $NFLX, $FB $TWTR etc. They go through rough patches but then suddenly find love. $AAPL Last 2 weeks hated to loved in a day. We play the action. Sometimes big ass dips a gift!
5927 2018-02-20 00:06:30 I do see your point, I’ve listened to both sides and I am trying to listen more, please dm me, I need to hear more of your opinions. Now I have ideas that don’t fully take away guns, perhaps certain guns or gun accessories. For example, bump stocks, they can be used at gun ranges
5928 2018-02-20 00:06:02 It's not a "we-we" school playground "both parties are equal" argument. 1. Gun control 2. Background checks 3. Ban military assault rifles 4. Ban bump stocks 5. Mass shootings aren't gang wars. They're premeditated mass murders.
5929 2018-02-20 00:06:01 Yes fbi can do a better job....but how about congress get off their butts and pass some common sense gun reform. They haven’t even bothered to bam bump stocks!!  Useless.
5930 2018-02-20 00:05:47 Distance is needed for hunting.....and to defend against a government aggressor......I'm against bump stocks, but the AR-15 is not the issue
5931 2018-02-20 00:04:51 If they dislike stocks they should look into CDOs and securitized products. Perfect diversification
5932 2018-02-20 00:04:29 Trump/GOP contribution to gun control:
Blocked rule on gun purchases by mentally ill
Easier for “Fugitives” to buy guns
Looser restrictions on gun use on Fed Lands
Proposed making it easier to buy silencers
Failed to ban bump stocks
Ignored proposal for Committee on Gun Violence
5933 2018-02-20 00:03:49 Stocks are literally useless.
5934 2018-02-20 00:03:21 "A lot of younger people are interested in things like cryptocurrencies, or alternative investments, because they've turned their backs on stocks" - Morgan Stanley
5935 2018-02-20 00:03:20 Stupid af how these rappers buy these chains that cost the same as an estate just to have them hanging around there neck. Put that shit in stocks and invest lol
5936 2018-02-20 00:02:42 Who else finds the ‘sqwark on the street’ ad on @CNBC with Jim Cramer ‘you cannot do it without what we are saying’ amusing?  “I will tell you what stocks are going to go higher and which ones will go lower” 
5937 2018-02-20 00:01:50 You don't seem to realize, when a Republican or a Republican-Lite like Clinton says something is "Good for the economy." they mean rich people. Not you. You aren't part of the economy they care about. They make their money in stocks that only do well when you suffer.
5938 2018-02-20 00:00:56 Like when the housing market crashed in 2008. It would be silly to ask some1 complaining about that or asking for something to be done to understand the ins and outs of home loans and stocks and all that goes along with it.
