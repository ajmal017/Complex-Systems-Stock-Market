38 2018-01-30 22:10:50 This doesn't necessarily mean that commodities will go up. The S&P could just crash
39 2018-01-30 22:09:54 We'd like to think Western cultures highly value our children. As of late I've been (strongly) reminded that our cultural acceptance of abortion & contraception has cemented the social status of children as commodities. We haven't progressed, just learned to be more sterile.
40 2018-01-30 22:07:45 Equities (global indexes included), commodities, cryptos at a relatively strong dip after days and weeks of bullish momentum. VIX, aka the fear index, is sharply rising. Recall that corrective moves follow an impulse until a clear trend reversal shows.

49 2018-01-30 21:41:02 You should probably use total return for stocks if you use total return for commodities. Puts stocks sky high. No reason whatsoever to expect the same long term return though.
50 2018-01-30 21:40:55 I would argue yes and no. Yes in the sense that it very much has inherent properties comparable to a durable commodity, but no in the sense that it has no track record (yet) of behaving in a way in the market that correlates with the behavior of other commodities.
51 2018-01-30 21:28:51 It's axiomatic that when stocks go down, bonds and commodities go up.
Don't go muni bonds, though, they've been trash since 2008. Commodities are a good medium-term hedge, but you can lose your ass doing short-term.
52 2018-01-30 21:26:31 One of the very reasons we complain more about food insecurity in Nigeria, is not because we don't produce more than enough farm produce. It's simply lack of storage and preservation of perishable commodities virtually needed by every homes.

66 2018-01-30 20:07:36 People need all commodities Rick. Which is why we measure their cost. People needed gasoline when oil was $130 a barrel and need it now when it’s $64. So we measure an average basket. 
FYI.
67 2018-01-30 20:05:15 They have gold.  They can now price key commodities in CNY (China's only short food & oil).  And China's military capabilities are getting very asymmetrical to the US - not as big or sophisticated per se but very effective potentially.
68 2018-01-30 20:04:28 You're absolutely right! But some of the happiest ppl are those who don't buy into the capitalist myth. Most ppl are happy to have the basics; food, shelter and work but even the basics have become commodities.
69 2018-01-30 19:59:16 Prices of commodities doesn't say we are in short supply.
70 2018-01-30 19:52:03 I thought you expected inflation higher EM, commodities and not an end of the bond bull market. Do you really think higher interest rates and further tightening can last with global debt at the current levels? I think they will revert to monetary expansion If equities correct.

115 2018-01-30 16:58:04 i didnt mean to put that across specifically, it is still a problem for other commodities, was just stating that as its not often addressed from my knowledge. crypto may be called out due to its design of dodging state intervention, again this is a problem depending on politics

126 2018-01-30 16:22:41 The article is correct. The ship did unload a load of LNG, that may have come out of the ground in Russia, but the sanctions don't cover who owns that ship, or the LNG they own; commodities don't get sanctioned, companies do. That company is free to do business with the USA.

133 2018-01-30 15:54:16 It has nothing to do with greed, it has everything to do with us communists seeing that the rich hold the power of life and death via commodities. We communists seek to over throw the rich because the rich would starve people to make profit.
134 2018-01-30 15:54:05 It's freeing to knowing that there is nothing we can "give" God because that means He loves us totally 100% because of our inner-most being, not the commodities that others seek to exploit from us.

152 2018-01-30 14:59:46 Sorry for jumping on ya; the disinformation campaign about the ship has been pretty incredible. They need to re-write the sanctions if they want that ship to fall into them.

174 2018-01-30 14:08:51 gold is a metal, a commodity. It can be bartered for other commodities, goods or services. However, I don't know any retailers that will accept gold in exchange for goods or services. I don't know any that will accept silver, iron, aluminium or baskets of grain either.

178 2018-01-30 13:45:16 The reduced costs of commodities/imports is not enough to make up for the lost wage income. The net flow is from developed economy middle class to developed economy elite via higher profits, emerging market middle class via wages, plus the lower prices
179 2018-01-30 13:41:52 According to @DinaPomeranz this is a very basic mistake, because of e.g. decreased price of commodities caused by globalisation. It strikes me that if this were such a basic mistake well educated economists would not make it. How to reconcile these views?
180 2018-01-30 13:39:26 stop using the word currency to describe commodities?

And I am not sure about interstate tax bcz gst take tax on commodities and that's why it's called one nation one market.

Earlier they used to take tax at state entry and latter they use to apply for refund.

The fact that the term “passion” was turned into a pejorative and that mment capability and passion were considered mutually exclusive commodities is plain bloody wrong. Passion was, is and always will be the fuel of football. Case closed.
