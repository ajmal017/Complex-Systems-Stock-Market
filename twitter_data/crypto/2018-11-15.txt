18 2018-11-15 23:56:38 You buy any token with the expectation it will appreciate in value or you wouldn't buy it.

45 2018-11-15 23:56:17 Even if all the exchanges were regulated in crypto that doesn't change his premise that a big player manipulated the market thus no ETF. Thus I don't really see the difference as far as the point he is trying to make is concerned.
46 2018-11-15 23:56:08 Which he did
47 2018-11-15 23:56:07 congratulations to them
48 2018-11-15 23:56:05 Right now the crypto ecosystem isn't very good. In 18-36 months, it'll be scary how good crypto is once scalable chains combine with stablecoins

60 2018-11-15 23:54:58 Impending $crypto break out. 

Take your bets - this is resistance to short if you think more down before up. This is the break out to buy if you're in for a quick ride up.
61 2018-11-15 23:54:50 Because you supported me. I’m so sorry.
62 2018-11-15 23:54:45 hopefully when they go online

71 2018-11-15 23:53:16 Lol no shit, that's why you shouldn't be accepting BCH
72 2018-11-15 23:53:06 Of course. It was the Globalists' plan all along to go to crypto-currency
73 2018-11-15 23:53:01 ...you're probably right, the significant loss in crypto values over the same period probably had nothing to do with crypto miners being willing to spend more on processors and electric bills.

79 2018-11-15 23:52:15 Amazingly both of these coins are doing this psych job of playing themselves off as the non-controversial, non-anarchist crypto for the rest of us, while being massive illegal securities offerings.

84 2018-11-15 23:51:40 hope nothing happens to you. You are one of the few decent people in crypto that stayed legit over the years.

honestly, it's growing on me 
88 2018-11-15 23:51:10 Today is one of those rare moments in crypto where we get to see a ‘financially irrational’ attack scenario play out.

92 2018-11-15 23:50:24 @mappopk_crypto You always motivate me.
Right you are! 
Fine!
93 2018-11-15 23:50:22 I have to agree, the commentary on this fork is , but this whole crypto thing is very new and we can learn a lot from forks... a week from now, we will all benefit from studying how this all turns out.
94 2018-11-15 23:50:12 @mappopk_crypto 
Fine!
Splendid!
It’s excellent!
95 2018-11-15 23:50:04 Needs a dick in the middle of those tongues 
96 2018-11-15 23:50:04 2020 will be a great year for crypto.
97 2018-11-15 23:50:03 No disrespect but I think crypto is gonna still be the next thing just wait we’ll see shows right/wrong 
98 2018-11-15 23:50:00 Didn't NVDA get over crypto last quarter? Maybe Jensen/NVDA wants to buyback at lower price. 
(I added too. Please don't tell anyone, just between you and me. LoL)
99 2018-11-15 23:49:47 Dow is down 1,000 points in the last 5 trading days.  Big flip into crypto is imminent imo
100 2018-11-15 23:49:33 $NVDA

Longs got cheated. 

Nvidia team misguided investors by deliberately downplaying the Crypto sales in prior 2-3 quarter earnings calls. They are acting as if they knew about it only this quarter...!!!

Complete loss of trust ....!!!

This is only GPUs  issue not Semis.

124 2018-11-15 23:45:50 Too many in the crypto space vastly overestimate how much the general public cares about “decentralized tech”.

Existing centralized options generally “work”. When your value story for the user is buried in the tech layer, you don’t win converts en masse.

141 2018-11-15 23:44:06 I'd say the entry point it pretty solid. Without the dump, it held its line pretty good even after the pumps. It's got alot of potential compared to most projects ahead of it in market cap.

162 2018-11-15 23:40:26 Same, people I speak too don’t even know the word crypto they recognize bitcoin only, is like when I tell someone here I’m from Amsterdam cause if I say Holland they think I’m talking about Poland lol
163 2018-11-15 23:40:21 When I tell people who are new to crypto how to buy coins through an exchange, I also have to have the conversation of what a hardware wallet is and why they need one.

166 2018-11-15 23:40:01 Mmm... I’m not sure, people only goes fiat-BTC for avoid volatility, if you always stay in BTC taxes are not really a problem. Taxes are in the gates of fiat not in crypto.
167 2018-11-15 23:39:43 I’m mobile and haven’t looked at the code. Is it legit (just naming/trademark) or dodgy (crypto miner eta al)
168 2018-11-15 23:39:35 Il y a un GAP entre ce qui est réalisable ou non. Je suis d'accord "La politique Française sur la Crypto est selon moi confiscatoire". Je sais qu'on peut tirer dans le bon sens : mais globalement ça ne changera pas. Cela ne sert à rien de s'attendre à une taxa' à 0 ou 10%

178 2018-11-15 23:38:25 Ahhhhh you're tickling my balls!!
179 2018-11-15 23:38:24 ... rather than do the hard work of making a crypto-economic incentive structure / algo that is resistant to attack, you're taking the easy way out and going proprietary. So security depends on that secret staying a secret, at best. You guys miss the whole point of crypto. SMH

Don’t think, you’re “better than” or “woke” because you think you’re in some revolutionary space that will change the world.

You’re a still a slave to financial gain.

Or that anyone with intimate knowledge of your algo can't use that to game it. It completely misses the point of crypto and tbh sounds like...

214 2018-11-15 23:33:10 I think @Dave_Jonez_02 answered your question. The latest version of xCurrent means that banks will be using XRP without knowing it.
215 2018-11-15 23:33:03 What all this bs means is that we need to scrap the paper ballot & get digital finger, Retina & face linked to your own unique SSN for future elections secured by crypto tech. It will be like going from dial up to 150mbs in technology pov.

225 2018-11-15 23:31:23 has been following a predictable pattern for 18 months now. It would be positive for crypto if it broke this pattern. However it's really hard for me to bet against something that's been on repeat for a year and a half. It's not worth the risk factor.

233 2018-11-15 23:30:20 Well, as I understand there are channels like the mailing list or maybe even crypto twitter. I think as a hodler, the real power you have is to decide which fork(s) to sell and which fork(s) to keep. This pretty much protects you from things like inflation.
234 2018-11-15 23:30:17 I’m sharing an opinion that I heard recently. What is obvious to you and me and to everyone on crypto Twitter isn’t guaranteed to make its way to mainstream. Their information comes from very different and inaccurate sources. They can’t easily decipher fact from fiction.

241 2018-11-15 23:28:46 There’s very little to read on that website. 

It’s just a simple breakdown of the current XRP ledger validators and clearly shows that @Ripple has ZERO control of the ledger. They have nowhere near the 80% super majority of validators needed to act alone.

250 2018-11-15 23:27:53 Oh absolutely. Bitcoin will never be the day to day crypto, don't think of it like that.

Bitcoin is the new gold. A store of value and (theoretically) a hedge against inflation.

When it hits 1 million, the USD will be *fucked*.

283 2018-11-15 23:22:52 BlocBuy is not just another crypto. It's a business, one that will be launched within a few months. It's a simple, practical use of blockchain technology to create efficiencies in antiquated systems. You know, what blockchain was meant to be used for. $bby
284 2018-11-15 23:22:37 But why not? It wouldn't be the weirdest thing we've seen happen in crypto.

286 2018-11-15 23:22:25 Ya that's what $AMD said on their last call too. No forcastable GPU sales related to crypto.
287 2018-11-15 23:22:09 Looking back on crypto, I'd gladly take the 2-5% stop losses than being too much of a little bitch to listen to my intuition. Not this time.
288 2018-11-15 23:22:01 I dont know why both AMD & Nvidia have gotten away with suggesting that crypto is not material to their business when it clearly was.  At certain level of popularity, any coin will get dedicated ASICs designed for it, so inevitability GPUs, become, like CPUs, irrelevant to mining

293 2018-11-15 23:21:44 I think we'll see it happen w fiat brokerage accounts at some point in our lifetimes. And as an intermediate term crypto bear but long term bull, I'll also say that no one should keep large amounts of crypto on exchanges, or have any exposure to Bitfinex/Tether.
294 2018-11-15 23:21:42 Yes! "crypto" is in a huge bubble. It's a flammable garbage pile waiting for a match. I hope this hash war is what sets it ablaze.
295 2018-11-15 23:21:32 Bitcoin market cap is i think ovet 850 times smaller then gold market cap. Maybe u get more risk free of those 10 years but i would take potential of crypto any time.

302 2018-11-15 23:20:53 Hey Trent, I donated in the efforts to save Eric de la Cruz in 2009 and meet you in Madrid, just a suggestion: your friend could accept donations in crypto, right now @blockchain is giving away $125 millions in stellar lumens, your fans could claim a little of it and donate
303 2018-11-15 23:20:50 I highly recommend people to not trade #crypto over their crazy volatility unless you know what you are doing.

 If you are looking to trade couple of coins that are looking good are $wax $xrp $spc 

Good luck and definitely sell the rallies in this market  $btc #crypto

Only positive is the product is still dominant, so, long term it will be fine I think as gaming, autonomous driving, the cloud are all still long-term trends reliant on the GPUs but man this was BAD even management missed how much crypto was impacting things

318 2018-11-15 23:18:13 #BTC During the past few years, many crypto analysts have been warning that central banks will create their own digital currency. Yesterday, the IMF announced the possibility of releasing a digital currency. How will this affect Bitcoin? Impossible to forecast. #Bitcoin
319 2018-11-15 23:18:08 "Investors" ???????   You mean that people actually consider crypto a serious investment ????
320 2018-11-15 23:17:43 Everybody says that BTC is the mother of all cryptos but i feel like the only mature crypto out their is XRP (with maybe few exceptions) XRP with a USE-CASE and a WORKING compagny. And the rest are all just little kidsss. Including the bitcoin fork family. #XRP #XRPcommunity

323 2018-11-15 23:17:24 Und ich frage mich ob aus HODLen nicht auch BODLen (Buy and hold more) bei sinkenden Crypto-Kursen sinnvoll ist.
324 2018-11-15 23:17:09 And all that energy is being expended and all that money is being spent for what exactly? There aren't even any legitimate transactions going through the network to verify. You could use that money and energy to build a factory instead. Brilliant, I must say.
325 2018-11-15 23:17:08 Better to call it Bitcoin Cash's first ever hash war - stating otherwise is misleading to the crypto uneducated.
326 2018-11-15 23:17:02 You know......

no matter how much we disliked Jihan, or Roger, or anyone else's actions, 

it is the behavior of CSW, self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto, that is caused the most actionable negativity in the crypto sector.

Leaders bring people together, not drive them apart.

May apply to crypto.
344 2018-11-15 23:14:02 Where do you live? I was in Japan earlier this year and saw that an appliance store was accepting Bitcoin for appliances. My ventures also accept crypto, though the % of crypto transactions are minuscule compared to traditional payments.

361 2018-11-15 23:12:03 What you wish is not exactly what it happens.
If you could go back in time to 2014 would you buy bitcoins as much as you can or still say it is bubble?
If you've never bought crypto then prepare to fill your bags up now or stay out again.

381 2018-11-15 23:10:01 I had a chat with my friend today at Uni. I was working on my crypto e-commerce shop in the cafè. He tells me ‘bitcoin is a bubble’. Followed by ‘what is bitcoin mining?’ I then realised the mass majority already THINK they are informed enough to have an opinion about crypto 1/2
382 2018-11-15 23:09:49 I support this!

386 2018-11-15 23:09:18 How many crypto bux do I need to buy to get sponsored by ESE?
387 2018-11-15 23:08:39 Is bitcoin decentralized if decision making is owned by a handful of wealthy miners? Don't get me wrong, I love crypto & whole "no central authority" narrative, but this hash war built upon ego & stupidity of some, showcased a authoritarian side of crypto not good for adoption.
388 2018-11-15 23:08:33 Ummm.. doesn’t matter much unless you want to convert crypto back to Fiat. If you are looking for safe custody look for decentralised exchanges.
389 2018-11-15 23:08:17 @Nouriel @Nouriel the problem is not in crypto it’s in the traditional markets and economics. People like you are the reason we are going to have a financial meltdown. Your economic theories will be seen as a failure as well as all the traditional theories.
390 2018-11-15 23:08:08 The bear market makes investors take flight towards real value. I think a lot of people are being humbled and coming to the reality that a lot of these projects might never recover. Many will run out of money and ultimately not make it. Find value before it's too late. #LINK #HOT

392 2018-11-15 23:07:49 I’ve been slammed with projects and my business so didn’t do it like i said above. Maybe when i get some free time here soon I’ll dish one out for fun and give out some crypto for a select few who spend time on it.
393 2018-11-15 23:07:41 Still, I think there could be enough of these irrational libertarian, anti-government crypto enthusiasts, that some of the currencies might stay around for a while. It is not about rational decisions anymore, it is more about faith. #Bitcoin is like a religion.

A hashwar is a great learning opportunity, and testing out 32m and 128m blocks is also. Best part, BTC gets to watch from a safe distance. How is this a bad thing? Its good
419 2018-11-15 23:03:19 Or the fact that his gf probably is costing him too...plus hes an idiot who knows.
More likely that he lost it in crypto currancy than doing drugs... he doesn't seem the type ya know
420 2018-11-15 23:03:10 Jesen Huang called GPU decline a "crypto hangover" - I highly doubt that. They are blaming their loss in sales to #crypto - when he said on past earnings calls that Crypto is a MINOR part of GPU sales. @nvidia's CEO Jesen Huang is a liar. $nvda @CNBCFastMoney
421 2018-11-15 23:03:09 I remember when I used to run crypto polls and get about 50 responses within 10 minutes. How times have changed

450 2018-11-15 22:59:57 this lunatic has enough influence and resources  to threat the crypto community. Just look how many hash power he has, enough to do a 51% attack on other POW coins... His ideology needs to be erased from this crypto space. #@$$%# CW

455 2018-11-15 22:59:15 I would not be surprised if the #SEC now approve or declare #XRP not a security after this sudden drop in Crypto to facilitate the bullrun accompanied by @DigitalAssets and @Bakkt coming this year / Q1 2019
456 2018-11-15 22:59:07 @crypto_spence who won the hard fork??? BTC or BCH?? Too many fake news
457 2018-11-15 22:59:05 $nvda again just blamed drop in GPU sales due to #crypto ahahah! Is this a YEARLY sum of sales (No) its a QUARTERLY call. There may be less  GPU mining but GPU sales due to crypto (a TINY MARKET) was not due to crypto. #AMD and #INTEL are coming in for a kill and a bear market.

468 2018-11-15 22:57:24 I’m struggling to accurately define this $BCH spectacle. An embarrassing experiment?A juvenile contest? 

In part, it’s a sign of this industry’s immaturity.

Going forward, it’ll prove the incentives to fork a crypto are only appealing in the short-term.

This a necessary lesson
469 2018-11-15 22:57:10 So how long before BAKKT delays launch?
470 2018-11-15 22:57:06 いいぞ！

474 2018-11-15 22:56:14 #Blockchain #Crypto Accurate. There's no need to chase trades needlessly.  Wait for the set-up.  And never put trading first.  You own bitcoin, bitcoin doesn't own you.  There's nothing to obsess over.  See my very first tweet about how important it is to identify these emotions

531 2018-11-15 22:49:41 I think the catalyst/growth for mining is there, but Crypto needs to find a base and bottom first. Just my observation. They have been downplaying the huge surge in sales associated with crypto mining. With decline is profits from mining = no one wants the chips.

533 2018-11-15 22:49:30 Crypto is available in Fidelity retirement plans. 1st listed is over $6k per unit and competitive with government fiat. The 2nd choice is about $1 per unit and is settling your cross border transactions. Which one gets bought more?

538 2018-11-15 22:48:52 ...or if your fiat is 'still good' that's probably your biggest reason to get onto crypto!

576 2018-11-15 22:43:20 So the CFO of $NVDA is blaming #crypto for its decline of GPU sales resulting in their after hours trading taking a beating. Didn’t they say crypto was a small portion of their sales? Lol cut the BS and buy some $LTC and $BTC
577 2018-11-15 22:42:50 Absolutely--that kind of drop in Bitcoin price is what I'd be looking for as an entry.

582 2018-11-15 22:41:12 Haha, I'll feel happy about that when the actual price reflects it. Personally I see this bear market continue for at least 18-24 more months with all crypto losing a lot more value (TRX included)
583 2018-11-15 22:41:08 Listening to the @nvidia earnings call and the CFO blame #crypto 3 times so far for reduced GPU sales which is HILARIOUS (not true) and an excuse for bad sales because Jensen Huang (CEO) said it was a minor part of their sales in the past... #nvidia $nvda
584 2018-11-15 22:41:05 NVIDIA stock has plunged by (a dramatic) 17% after earnings tonight, based on downside revenue from the burst of crypto ($2.7B guidance for Q4 vs. $3.4B analyst expectations). In 1.5 months, the stock has now fallen by 44% from its all-time high of $298 on Oct 1st, to $168 now.
585 2018-11-15 22:40:52 US, not international. What a leap backward in terms of decentralization. Bitcoin is not a political weapon. It saddens me to see this.

Binance has picked the side of politics over crypto.
586 2018-11-15 22:40:49 Hey Littleideas - do you think testing this on a computer that has ZERO connection to anything crypto related would be 'safe'? Could a Chrome Extension only affect/connect to the machine it's installed on?

592 2018-11-15 22:39:48 we will see :) For now I can see XRP as instrument for banks to safe money only. I don´t think the banks will accept XRP as currency. They will fight for fiat and later on they will create their own crypto money, centralized. At this point they will not need XRP anymore.
593 2018-11-15 22:39:45 @GuyAdami That’s garbage badmouth $NVDA because of being over exuberant on crypto I mean unlike everyone else was  NVDA is the premier graphics co period no competition mark this tweet you will eat those words  go buy $AMD

595 2018-11-15 22:39:36 If there was ever any doubt that $BCH was a centralized crypto, I guess it’s crystal clear by now.

The more they fork, the more centralized it gets.

597 2018-11-15 22:39:16 So did the #crypto markets take a dive just before the #BCH hard fork because the largest supporters of ABC and SV needed the capital to push their coin to the promise land?? Hate to tell you guys, but there is only one real #Bitcoin.

618 2018-11-15 22:36:21 That drop can also mean a prolonged bear market, which wouldnt make investors to rush ahead and buy it. Also I dont think theres enough panic in the market which prevents a consensus of thinking that we had the bottom. I would be patient. Not considering liquidity issues thou.

653 2018-11-15 22:31:23 I am aware, but that doesn't diminish the fact governments will absolutely try to mettle, interfere, or tax crypto in the future. All you have to do is watch the Rudy Guliani narrated ads about the Dark Web to know the propaganda machine is in full force already.

660 2018-11-15 22:30:24 I'd do what I told people wanting to invest after the crash. Put 1-2% or so of retirement on support buys all the way down to a double digit $ETH and triple digit $BTC with heaviest on bottom. Come back n 2 years and see what happened. No one misses 1-2%. Short term is just noise
661 2018-11-15 22:29:56 Not at all.  Especially with 2 children fighting

663 2018-11-15 22:29:46 Til there is a stable coin that has scale ability, stability, liquidity and true transparency crypto is very dangerous. It has lost 75% of it's worth in less than a year. Gold is far too volatile. I would go with t-note if it's a 10 year investment, it's the best bet.

666 2018-11-15 22:29:02 The old argument of 'there can be more than 21mill coins if you just fork bitcoin' is proven to be invalid by this BCH fork fork madness.
667 2018-11-15 22:28:59 I believe the answer is risk/reward
668 2018-11-15 22:28:48 Yes ofcourse. You want to ADD $btc and it's 16% cheaper. You even hope it dips more.
Buy red sell green.
669 2018-11-15 22:28:37 *YAWN* The fact that you save screen shots of conversations and FUD the same project 24/7 makes you a weirdo to everyone watching, you do know that, right?

Normal people who don’t believe in a project accept the fact that its a junk coin and just move on with their lives.  
670 2018-11-15 22:28:09 same thing ive been doing.. wait..

673 2018-11-15 22:28:01 @hard_webber what do you think is the best way to avoid bad investments in crypto?
674 2018-11-15 22:28:01 The risk/reward profile compensates (I think) for these uncertainties. BTC is not a good investment for everyone right now, depends on many factors
675 2018-11-15 22:27:56 Y de la aprobación del ETF ni hablemos no?
676 2018-11-15 22:27:51 Replace "bitcoin" with "natural gas". I'd argue that bitcoin offers better diversification among the two. With a sound strategy and proper risk management, you shouldn't be scared of adding either to a portfolio.
677 2018-11-15 22:27:41 But when the 3th bubble will come, all random who don’t read and tryhard our beautiful crypto world will invest in Bitcoin because they know it only and buy all their shitcoins in.. Btc, the flippening can be real, but only in bear market.
678 2018-11-15 22:27:27 Buy.
679 2018-11-15 22:27:05 Barbell
680 2018-11-15 22:27:00 Nice Job! That was a step up 
681 2018-11-15 22:26:59 Awesome. Love to see LA getting stronger and stronger. And love that you are crypto-friendly!
682 2018-11-15 22:26:39 if you liked it at 6300, then you should LOVE it at 5300. 

Anyone that manages a large portfolio understands value over price. 

The price of BTC is $1000 cheaper, but the value remains the same as yesterday.
683 2018-11-15 22:26:36 the drop would honestly just make me wanna push for even more fallout. but also I would start buying into positions because of how JUST'd the entire market is. I wouldnt care for "confidence" at all, im confident this assetclass is a volatile hedge. Maybe drop 0.1% in it.
684 2018-11-15 22:26:25 Dash down by 13% in the last 24h. #dash #crypto #southafrica

690 2018-11-15 22:25:28 This was a perfectly normal discussion before your conspiracy theorist, anti-Semitic tinged nonsense comment. There’s no point engaging further.
691 2018-11-15 22:25:27 I think the BCH fork madness really highlights that there is only 1 bitcoin and anything else is just a fake.

699 2018-11-15 22:24:25 Guess not. But I’m not a portfolio manager. Maybe we should ask @novogratz?
700 2018-11-15 22:24:24 Yap, unlike 2014, there might be a significant hash rate decline now. Still, I don't see this as something that could create a death spiral. If Bitcoin really is anti-fragile, after a few quarters both price and hash rate should stabilize.
701 2018-11-15 22:24:22 Exactly..
702 2018-11-15 22:24:12 nope
703 2018-11-15 22:24:08 @ProfFaustus BTC, with it's flaws and straying from Satoshi's white paper, is still what's bringing crypto to global/mass adoption. Why do we have to kill BTC in order for SV to come out on top? Let the space thrive, let people enter BTC, and then let them come to SV naturally.

720 2018-11-15 22:22:07 Hold my ear... I'm going to take a wack at this crypto thing!
721 2018-11-15 22:21:52 Yo Spencer, are you referring to the current crypto market?
722 2018-11-15 22:21:29 good
723 2018-11-15 22:21:20 Haven't had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich since i saw that documentary
724 2018-11-15 22:21:19 It’s times like this I’m very grateful to be able to read all the dumbass tweets from crypto experts that purchased their first bitcoin last year.

Shit ain’t dying, although some of your shitcoins might, and this isn’t even close to capitulation.

Immensely entertaining.
725 2018-11-15 22:21:10 close my short position and open a long until 2022.

729 2018-11-15 22:20:56 Hit up @choonhq 
Super easy to upload stuff and it’s crypto based if you’re into that. Besides that, it’s a growing platform
730 2018-11-15 22:20:56 Couldn't have put it better myself.

$CHX has surprised a few already and will surprise even more going forward.

735 2018-11-15 22:20:35 This whole $BCHABC $BCHSV war not only made CT fun again, it made me more #Bullish on $BTC than ever before. How are those shitcoins ever going to compete to the one stable factor in #crypto? (Not talking about price fluctuations).
736 2018-11-15 22:20:26 I've been growing more fond of the concepts of crypto for years, but its very threat to government control is, in and of itself, a threat to crypto's very existence. So give me the bars~

748 2018-11-15 22:19:35 Quite a record concerning missing the point here (about why Crypto's even exist), I'd say ..

757 2018-11-15 22:18:37 Not sure why. Maybe I just got in the zone but likely it's the volume and the predictable volatility but these last two days have been my most profitable of the year. #xrp #btc #crypto

762 2018-11-15 22:17:46 If it all goes to 0, we still have the tech.

Personally I’m only in for the tech. That’s why I’ve never invested in a crypto project. I just made some donation..

770 2018-11-15 22:17:10 If you talk to @jonnylitecoin he can tell you that Chargebacks are rarely used for good reasons. Its usually fraud on the customers part. 

The reason chargebacks exist is to prevent fraud from credit theives who stole your number.  That cant really happen via crypto

777 2018-11-15 22:15:58 A bit of hype and speculation is ok. Remember, to be into crypto like we are the rest of the population think we are crazy. We have all by default "connected the dots" and are trying to look 2 steps into the future. We have a lot in common with the 589ers.

780 2018-11-15 22:15:34 I think it's a "sector" issue. Crypto is VERY small when compared to other asset classes and markets such as stocks and gold. Very, very small. So, when on one asset is affected, it affects many others. The space isn't big enough to prevent this (yet).
781 2018-11-15 22:15:31 BCHの乖離ひどいことになってますね。。

803 2018-11-15 22:12:14 people in well off countires wondering where crypto went because they never hear about it, meanwhile 3rd world countries using bitcoin as their primary currency. Not a lot of point to use crypto when your fiat is still good, it's when fiat dips that we see huge crypto spikes
804 2018-11-15 22:12:12 I’m not touching alts again until btc finds a bottom. Made some good money on the bounce yesterday. In cash until these 4900-5100 buys hit, then I’ll do some shopping.
805 2018-11-15 22:12:10 nvda down over 40% from peak, and earning's miss was 5%, mostly from crypto?
806 2018-11-15 22:11:55 Yesterday I ended up closing my charts and taking the day off. Today I didn’t even look at my charts. Idk how people justify getting completely out of crypto

811 2018-11-15 22:11:26 There are a few cases where btc has been seized..
But the average potential user does not care about that. Day to day tx should be the main goal of any fiat replacement.
Only the already (relatively) wealthy in Ven. or Turkey can afford to dabble in crypto. And they still can't..
812 2018-11-15 22:11:16 I know alot of things but unfortunately they are all bad.
813 2018-11-15 22:11:15 Refunds would come from a new transaction sent back, and fraud is very hard via crypto aince you need the private key. 

In commerce, the customer ia more likely to fraud, not much incentive for a company to fraud. 

And in the end, it would all still be illigal
814 2018-11-15 22:11:06 送金まだ…？
815 2018-11-15 22:11:04 I guess there arn't really "bad people." Maybe its a positive thing to try to see the good in everyone. There's for sure bad coins to invest in though. Need to switch that off and be a bit more of a dick when it comes to crypto research.

848 2018-11-15 22:07:24 They lied to you for thousands of years: kings, queens & prophets. They said take this it has value and they enslaved you to their system. Crypto is the real value. Verified. Immutable. Irreversible. They're scared of it, but you have to hodl strong, and one day it will pay off.
849 2018-11-15 22:07:23 @mappopk_crypto doing a great job :)
850 2018-11-15 22:07:21 You’ve made your decision. Apparently I can’t help change that. If crypto is sht you shouldn’t be holding any for any miracle to happen. Just take your losses and leave.

864 2018-11-15 22:06:29 Welp, more power to crypto

883 2018-11-15 22:04:02 we're busy making fun of a different crypto-buffoon-conman today, could you hold off a bit?
884 2018-11-15 22:03:51 HA, i do not believe I said Ripple, did I?  xRapid is blockhain last time I checked which utilizes its native crypto XRP token.

1018 2018-11-15 21:50:07 #XRP is holding well above recent lows, but if we see it decouple from #BTC, this would be a major step forward in the evolution of the crypto markets. We’d love to see each crypto currency trade based on it’s own fundamentals, and not whatever BTC happens to do. #cryptocurrency

1059 2018-11-15 21:46:01 Let Iranians do what they want. It’s crypto we’re talking about. Crypto is supposed to be censorship and sanctions resistant.
1060 2018-11-15 21:45:57 Any crypto'currency'. 
Esp. Btc/xbt. It is now a parody of itself, with only speculators or 'hodlers' actually using it... But not as money.
1061 2018-11-15 21:45:56 <- decided to do the smallest crypto-giveaway inthe world!
1062 2018-11-15 21:45:48 The mind boggling thing is that every time the real Elon tweets, dozens of these ridiculous "crypto giveaway" tweets pop up - they wouldn't go to all that trouble unless their lame scam actually tricked people!

*PSA: Elon Musk will never give you free cryptocurrency.
1063 2018-11-15 21:45:46 They claim they will mine at a loss for two years...or something like that

1065 2018-11-15 21:45:19 the regulation landscape is *even tougher*...so many unknowns and TBD's

did the dotcom'ers have to go through with what regulators are making crypto go through?
1066 2018-11-15 21:45:17 CSW just detailed their plan. “Let them run ahead and keep it going till they’re bankrupt, it’s borrowed and bought hash”

Your first bit of 'evidence' was a joke based on guesswork and conveniently ignored relevant methedologies. I'll give these a read as well and no doubt find the same guesswork.

1093 2018-11-15 21:42:42 I’ve still come out of the experience better.

That was the spiritual goal. The rest was just form.

1095 2018-11-15 21:42:25 They probably are talking only about btc market cap. Not the whole crypto
1096 2018-11-15 21:42:24 Yussss so good.
1097 2018-11-15 21:42:24 Bitcoin will never be the global currency used for everyday payments. It’s the gold standard for the crypto market. Nobody makes everyday purchases with gold but it is still bought and is extremely valuable. Another coin will be used for everyday payments. Which one though?

1101 2018-11-15 21:42:10 Never in all his decades in NYC did anyone see anything suspicious in Trump's life. But as soon as he beats Clinton, he's a traitor, racist, election cheat, conspirator with Russia, white supremecist, woman hater, crypto-Nazi, Islamophobe. Amazing, right?
1102 2018-11-15 21:42:05 What would you need to see for you to change your opinion?  Still have a positive long term view?

1104 2018-11-15 21:41:58 It’s a great time to have a job for the next 2 years. Imagine putting it all into crypto & 100xing a few years of 6 figure salary.
1105 2018-11-15 21:41:32 $NVDA dropping makes sense to me. The crypto bubble is bursting. The new AI bubble is gonna be next. 

That said it is still a great company and a great product. It's gonna be another two quarters before I go long with it.

1107 2018-11-15 21:41:23 
1108 2018-11-15 21:41:23 Agree.  Have the same feeling.  Not based on any TA.  But saw this video of @TrueCrypto28 earlier today and could look like the secondary Bear mkt he mentions in there.  So caution is needed and no urgency to jump back in.
1109 2018-11-15 21:41:21 Hmm, how does one monitor stats on if an SV node crashes or not? Would the “node count” on cash coin dance decrease if a node crashes?

1115 2018-11-15 21:40:27 Crypto Twitter is obsessed with the idea of "calls" and who made bad/great ones.

A good trader makes money by reacting. There is no requirement to make crystal ball calls months in advance to make money.

1117 2018-11-15 21:40:24 Just reading through your George Soros backed study. There are all kinds of research gaps and guesswork. The study also doesn't factor in 'public goods' for migrants (ie. the NHS). Dud study. I'll ask again, do you have a legitimate study?
1118 2018-11-15 21:40:24 Desperate move.. longer the BTC miners are forced onto the BCH ABC chain, faster the BitcoinCom pool is going to evaporate

1138 2018-11-15 21:39:41 The intrinsic meaning of value, in terms of investment, is a function of the asset's use cases and it's associated supply and demand ratio. Even if crypto hypothetically went to 0, XMR would still be needed and widely used, privacy is the strongest use case in Crypto.

1159 2018-11-15 21:38:06 Yeah what a joke, ‘DYOR and contact your financial advisor’ looooooooool people that invest in crypto are definitely not going through an advisor ffs
1160 2018-11-15 21:38:04 Are you sure he posted this, I went all the way back on his /rippled (when it was open) and never saw this? I have my doubt. You have a history link with his name?
1161 2018-11-15 21:37:56 There are several wooden ones in Germany.
I've been on 2 or 3 but not sure if I have been on the one you're talking about.

1163 2018-11-15 21:37:48 Crypto currencies = Money laundering. User friendlyness means transparency which would kill the market for the crooks. So... of course that won't happen.
1164 2018-11-15 21:37:45 Look up the meaning of crypto
1165 2018-11-15 21:37:32 Two small cap crypto assets under $1.2 Million market cap that I like

$BLUE - security protocol smart contracts

$TKS - B2B solutions for cannabis (weed) industry

I don't own either, nor do I intend to buy at the moment but I see bright futures for both

1176 2018-11-15 21:35:59 Can you please explain what is the relationship between the hash rate and I assume the weak hands that own Bitcoin?
1177 2018-11-15 21:35:45 But guys... WOW!!!
1178 2018-11-15 21:35:40 Weren't you expecting this though?
1179 2018-11-15 21:35:32 If some who are invested in BTC, BCH, EOS, and Eth begin to migrate to #IGG, this bull run will continue all the way to $1.00 and beyond. There is a new sheriff in Crypto and his name is, #IGG. They are more than just a token, they have their own ecosystem, replete with partners

1269 2018-11-15 21:25:30 Bitcoin is far from any form of money. Bitcoin was just the foundation of crypto, the pairing and its commercialized name across the globe. making the crowd aware of blockchain tech & currencies.

1284 2018-11-15 21:24:35 7k at best.  peeps this year are mocking crypto, last year they went with the cool crowd so no new money
1285 2018-11-15 21:24:34 Which would destroy the idea of decentralized crypto.  Just reinvented banking, but with superflouous computations.
1286 2018-11-15 21:24:33 + most studies include benefits and exclude working tax credits. The majority of low-income EU workers claim working tax credits. When you factor this in they're not an economic benefit.
1287 2018-11-15 21:24:30 It's amazing that two snake oil salesmen dweebs (CSW & Ver) can capture the attention span of the entire crypto space from both market volume & a media standpoint. 

Meanwhile in *real* cryptoland, there's incredible innovation happening everywhere you turn, and no one notices.

1294 2018-11-15 21:24:05 I'm already fed up of this #fork drama and #hash crap..

Why do smart people create irresponsible wars within our own #Crypto world? Individually bright people but dangerous as a group..

I'm considering shutting my crypto life down for 6 months as I have better things to do..
1295 2018-11-15 21:23:38 Exactly man. Your insight are awesome. Don’t forget, that crypto is the most manipulated market in the world.
1296 2018-11-15 21:23:24 It is a very interesting and perspective project. Good luck team! I wish you the BEST!!!
1297 2018-11-15 21:23:12 Times are tricky, but if you buy $FTM and use a stop-loss below previous Kucoin lows you are at least not risking that much % currently.
1298 2018-11-15 21:23:04 Nouriel, what do you think about a Central Bank issued coin or backed by major banks? Using similar technology as XRP or some other crypto’s. Not mined but issued by central bank using blockchain as a new channel like internet became a new channel for banking ?

1312 2018-11-15 21:20:59 I get the publicity for crypto that this would, most certainly, generate and the lib media would have a field day if you can get grab their attention but do you really want to play amongst people who will look for every dark story in your life and cackle on about it at every opp?

1358 2018-11-15 21:14:08 Indeed. A fork by a credible alliance is the most effective way to destroy a crypto currency. Cyber punks underestimate how useless their tokens would become if the general public (and exchanges) would switch. A sea of crypto whales is a dead sea.

1380 2018-11-15 21:11:57 I believe that once Coinbase CEO said that they will add only decentralized coins, wich XRP is NOT. Sry guys. Sell that bank coin. Whole idea of crypto is to get rod of banks. Buy #trx , i think it has great potential. Cheers!

1387 2018-11-15 21:11:20 100% agreed. IMO, for mass adoption of some sort of crypto payments app, it needs to be as familiar, friendly and as easy to use as your Starbucks app. Like all great technologies, crypto will fade into the background.
1388 2018-11-15 21:11:03 Probably buy more #Bitcoin
1389 2018-11-15 21:11:02 it would be interesting to see the connection between crypto and the Internet of Value.  I can see the potential of some of the alts beginning to decouple from BTC in the very near future #XRPtheStandard

1401 2018-11-15 21:09:21 And you could only produce 2 more blocks than Satoshi’s coin?
1402 2018-11-15 21:09:18 BTC was sent from one address to another. It turns bearish if the receiver is an exchange address, meaning it's most likely taken from cold storage and can possibly be dumped on the market. But there's lots of other reasons which could very well be nothing

1409 2018-11-15 21:07:39 The price will jump in 2019 ... with a such a spike that will leave the rest of the Crypto’s behind.
My price prediction: 
January 2019 = $3 
December 2019 = $ 50
1410 2018-11-15 21:07:39 $LTC 2.23% move in last 60 minutes.  Last price: $42.60.  $LTCUSD #LTCUSD #LTC #Litecoin #coinbase #gdax
1411 2018-11-15 21:07:35 Seems we agree where the monetary system is headed. I don't think it's possible to predict when confidence in it ends. Sovs not buying as many UST & adding gold, people's interest in crypto, & 'populism' on the rise are some signs it may be sooner rather than later.
1412 2018-11-15 21:07:23 first say bitcoin Cash is satoshi's vision and will not be changed. And now a fork? Ah yes.

1437 2018-11-15 21:02:56 And this is why BTC, BCH are not the future. Purely short term scams used for traders to make money. I'm fine with that but this sort of crap just proves why these two solutions are not the future of banking. Good job.
1438 2018-11-15 21:02:56 I believe strongly in a future w/ crypto in it, one that will have different types of blockchain-based, tokenized economies.

1457 2018-11-15 21:01:00 @coinmine, a @coinbase backed startup, will launch a mining/staking device for people at home. Especially after today I’m very excited about these kind of projects. Bringing decentralization to #crypto. After $eth, $zec and $xmr they will also support their first #PoS coin: $XTZ
1458 2018-11-15 21:00:36 So true. Crypto opens Ur eyes 2 da Truth! 
1459 2018-11-15 21:00:32 did they say "crypto", though?
1460 2018-11-15 21:00:19 What all these tweeter expert personalities don’t understand is there is no, CEO to drive $BTC to 0 Value. As long as there are two connected computers running the blockchain and two willing parties for P2P trans, u can’t stop it. Don’t be dumb fuqs. All though most of u are.

1462 2018-11-15 21:00:02 Might be getting an opportunity to work more on Blockchain than Cryptocurrency starting next year.

Not going to lie, eschewing the get-rich-quick mentality that infects much of crypto...everything could be pretty nice.

1472 2018-11-15 20:59:20 Such people must be willing to learn the basics, such as copy and pasting, sending an email, utilising social media, facebook especially because thats what we use to connect with our teams in groups - we teach it all, in the same way we teach people how to trade crypto and forex.

1483 2018-11-15 20:58:15 People have been buying the dip all year in order to DCA only for $BTC to break support down to 5400k

1486 2018-11-15 20:57:26 Crypto Drama of the Year!
1487 2018-11-15 20:57:26 Crypto might change things. At least for weak economies, which can not maintain their own currency, and can not have foreign currency because they become dependent. Bitcoin can become independent money for those cause its monetary base is predictable.
1488 2018-11-15 20:57:18 Panera Bread goers are the adoption group on the other side of the chasm. Crypto needs them. You are right by the way. This is why crypto has only proven itself as sov not for day to day tx

1502 2018-11-15 20:55:59 I’m glad the bears finally pushed through. Better than $BTC going sideways for a few more months. The sooner the weak hands are shaken out  the sooner we can expect some positive momentum again

1513 2018-11-15 20:54:53 Hard forks should be banned if the original will still exist. If you think you have a better idea for a coin go make a new one. Forks will be the death of crypto if it's not stopped.

1525 2018-11-15 20:53:57 what are your microcap picks?
1526 2018-11-15 20:53:52 Previous bottom around 150-250 lasted almost a year.
Well, it was a double bottom with sideways.
It could be another type of bottom for sure
1527 2018-11-15 20:53:34 Btw, I also believe they are going to fail. But because they are centralized and not a crypto. I am investing in a competitor to Q
1528 2018-11-15 20:53:33 The features this exchange has are so dope. 25 different order types, staking, bonusses, TradingView integrated, mobile app! 

Oh, and: don't forget to participate in the give-away of 6000 $BXY tokens (300$) EVERY SINGLE DAY, just click the "participate" button in your account!
1529 2018-11-15 20:53:26 Lots of news articles taking about 8% drops in Australian house prices over the past year, predicting they could drop up to 30% and people are panicking. More home owners should buy crypto, 30% won't seem like much when they're used to 90% drops in their alt coins!
1530 2018-11-15 20:53:16 Then it looks much better 
1531 2018-11-15 20:53:09 So there’s no reliable POS terminals accepting crypto? I hope they will appear soon (how about facilitating that @sendwyre ?)
1532 2018-11-15 20:52:56 Thanks for the lessons, I kinda get it all now

1535 2018-11-15 20:52:36 Most of that area is high-salinity flats, much of it non-arable or rapidly becoming non-arable.

I reckon it could be a humidity or surface-reflectivity assay.  Maybe vegetation and/or heat sig.  Seems odd to send a U2 up when a POES bird can get it, though.
1536 2018-11-15 20:51:33 Do you dine alone?
1537 2018-11-15 20:51:21 That would be the slowest recorded growth in crypto history lol
1538 2018-11-15 20:51:18 Not really convinced by that, the euros don't want a deal. Think a conservative party hard fork is looking more likely at the moment.
1539 2018-11-15 20:51:15 nice
1540 2018-11-15 20:51:07 You don't know what "fiat" means.  Crypto is voluntary.  It's not dictated by decree.
1541 2018-11-15 20:51:01 Kms?
1542 2018-11-15 20:50:56 It’s Roger’s personal coin.
1543 2018-11-15 20:50:51 Having a leader is always a red flag in crypto. Decentralize or die.
1544 2018-11-15 20:50:41 This is Libertarian crypto

1545 2018-11-15 20:50:33 Agree 100%, even after last few stressful months (I’m in since March 17) In January I will be traveling a few months (Thailand, Laos, Cambodia..all thanks to crypto) I will be less trader, and more hodler, but I need it.

1579 2018-11-15 20:47:31 Whereas crypto has nothing to show for those millions/billions in valuation. NOTHING. and if you say otherwise you're just lying to yourself. I still hold a lot of alts just in case it gets manipulated again and pumps for 24h. Yes, I've lost 80% this year.

1583 2018-11-15 20:47:07 People like to speculate. Crypto isn’t going anywhere. Mining is fun and valuable to supporting a “decentralized future” (however you want to define that. )

There’s a job to be done and they’re helping ppl do it ... 
1584 2018-11-15 20:47:04 Whether you’re a little wet behind the ears in the world of cryptocurrency or you have been blazing the crypto trail for a while, the Wild West Crypto Show on is the best crypto podcast to show you the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of crypto. @WWCSTX
1585 2018-11-15 20:47:02 Another bad habit brought on by SV and crypto hedge funds. You can’t diversify money. Better yet fiat plus bitcoin is a better strategy.

1587 2018-11-15 20:46:31 You are headed to jail sir
1588 2018-11-15 20:46:27 Guys - remember that the manipulation comes in two forms 1) market manipulation tactics 2) media and words...including (fake) tweets about quitting crypto to scare the retail investors out of the game. And it is all being done to corner the market for themselves by buying cheap.

1592 2018-11-15 20:46:01 This is true. 

Girlfriend (Red Days): How's "your crypto doing?"

Girlfriend (Green Days): How's "OUR CRYPTO DOING HONEY!?!"

The kicker, she's denies it.

1594 2018-11-15 20:45:59 それはDASHだな。おかしいな、鞄に入れた覚えはないのに…それは匿名取引を行うのに必要な通貨だ。最初の名前は「ダークコイン」。coinjoinという支払った人と支払われた人の関係性を隠蔽するシステムを使って、匿名取引を可能にしてる。海外では自販機で使えるところもあるそうだ。
1595 2018-11-15 20:45:59 You’ve got $5,000 to invest in #crypto...
1596 2018-11-15 20:45:54 So I was one of those guys with Crypto Fever.  I got out about a week ago and was up 30% overall.   Had I gotten out much earlier would have been 80%! Lots of lessons here ...for another tweet
1597 2018-11-15 20:45:51 @pewdiepie "I don't trust anyone over 50 to tell me what's best for the internet ecosystem"

@cz_binance "While the adults are all fighting over whether crypto will be real or not, the kids are quietly building the future"

Basically, our generation has to fix their fuck ups too.

The next big move in crypto will be due to TRON. And the the catalyst behind that will be IGG. Just look at the DEX to see what a tron token can accomplish. @Official_IGG is the shining example of what is possible through hard work and a superior blockchain

1637 2018-11-15 20:41:46 Tell Sun I said hello! I love that dude.
1638 2018-11-15 20:41:45 Oh the alt market is the wild west, and many will fail, some will succeed, and some will eliminate crypto entirely and use the tech in other ways, I agree. Regulation can help and also hurt, but in 10-15 years, this space will be untecognizable.

1646 2018-11-15 20:40:37 Why are almost all crypto prices synchronized? Ran a poll here asking if any had sold #XRP because of falling prices, and 8% voted yes.  I did not sell any XRP and 92% of the people in the poll did not sell, so what's going on?  Most are not selling, so the supply is the same?
1647 2018-11-15 20:40:31 I hope they both win and we all make money!!! That’s ALL that matters in the end to me anyways...

1649 2018-11-15 20:40:02 It's not easy to admit new technologies but that's life. It's my pleasure to present you a unique level's ICO-project. I would like to present you this @toqqnproject. #Toqqn #ICO # crypto # bitcoin @toqqnproject

1653 2018-11-15 20:39:38 I'm very satisfied with the quality of this product. I place confidence in this ICO-project and I will advise it to every single person who is involved with crypto. Trust me, this product in indeed that good! #Toqqn #ICO # crypto # bitcoin @toqqnproject
1654 2018-11-15 20:39:22 たえた！

1656 2018-11-15 20:39:15 It is highly unlikely that there can be a better ICO-project to try ever. They mix the best features present in the subject and add their own state-of-the-art ideas. #Toqqn #ICO # crypto # bitcoin @toqqnproject
1657 2018-11-15 20:39:03 good news...thank you.. seems to be very good project
1658 2018-11-15 20:38:56 I have guns.

I guess I'm not selling my guns to shady characters.

I'm not in the schools that are getting shot up so I guess I'm not doing much directly. 

Really I don't know what to do about preventing future murders.
1659 2018-11-15 20:38:52 I entirely support the idea of this project. I checked out the description of their strategy and everything seems to be very crystal-clear and high-potential. Don't hesitate, give is a shot! #Toqqn #ICO # crypto # bitcoin @toqqnproject
1660 2018-11-15 20:38:52 I dumped on the news. Later I thought i'd reconsider around 250 sats (450ish at the time) and XVG folks said it'd never get that low again....

Yeah...about that...still haven't entered in yet.
1661 2018-11-15 20:38:42 Thanks Matt 
1662 2018-11-15 20:38:39 Big boys can buy here, add more at 4k and filled again at 3k. We can't, we need confirmation before buying. Enough blood as been spilled for the same reason at 6k.
1663 2018-11-15 20:38:29 It has taken me long to get a sense of blockchain technologies. But here I am. Be wise and check this extraordinary ICO. You're welcome! #Toqqn #ICO # crypto # bitcoin @toqqnproject
1664 2018-11-15 20:38:20 Yeah, reputation is contextual and furthermore, its subjective 

Public key crypto + a gossip protocol (like scuttlebutt) + distributed hash tables are sufficient. 

Building reputation systems on a blockchain is a poor design choice

1671 2018-11-15 20:37:20 Yes
1672 2018-11-15 20:37:14 My tricks to stay sane in #crypto: when the market gets crazy about #Bitcoin price action or the next Satoshi’s Vision drama (or both), stay away from media (even my favorites like @tokendaily) and read some technical stuff that was sitting in my open tabs forever
1673 2018-11-15 20:37:11 I work flexible hours. And crypto is for fun. But flexible involves more than 8 hours, especially because I spend the most for my App :)

1678 2018-11-15 20:36:54 If $xrp has proven anything; its much more stable than other crypto’s and far less drama. No worries about hash power, infighting and chain splits. After all the crap we have seen with $btc and $bch; I’m starting to think decentralization is just a wet dream.

1680 2018-11-15 20:36:35 Yes, the signals are mixed, and I wouldn't be surprised if we will never see such cheap prices for $BTC again. But we trade possibilities, so I just incline to give more chances for the bearish scenario short-term, while logically we should go up. #Crypto is alogical though.

1747 2018-11-15 20:29:09 The longer this hash war between $BAB and $BSV continues the more likely $BCASH will self-destruct. They have been at it for 4 hours now, an eternity in a crypto war.
1748 2018-11-15 20:29:07 I guess the epic fail of the BCH fork is a death sentence for Bitmain and its accounting scam of valuing all their worthless BCH coins at cost of acquisition.
Their assets are worthless, their profits are fake, their whole business model is dead, just like their IPO. RIP crypto.

1893 2018-11-15 20:06:50 totally agree, you have to take out the BCH garbage and environment, you have to leave a clean path in crypto world to grow steadily.
1894 2018-11-15 20:06:43 Wonderful project
1895 2018-11-15 20:06:16 11/16 is also exactly 31 years 4 weeks after Black Monday 1987, the pi-coding of history repeating in patterned cycles.

And reminder that the DOW JONES =666 dropped 666 points on the 33rd day of this year, 30 years 3 months (14 days) after Black Monday 1987.
1896 2018-11-15 20:06:02 Dang. That was dope. Thanks.

1902 2018-11-15 20:05:25 Yeah and we all know the crypto scene is a strange beast
1903 2018-11-15 20:05:24 Been out of my $BCH trade in modest profit for awhile now.  Too much drama leading into the fork.  

My current large-cap $crypto play, $ZEC, has the possibility of a #coinbase add as its fundamental driver.  Reasons I chose it over $ADA and $XLM are laid out in an earlier tweet.
1904 2018-11-15 20:05:21 It certainly is....
1905 2018-11-15 20:05:16 Always has been

1912 2018-11-15 20:04:25 Yes I totally agree with you, the notion of "decentralized" became a fake notion due to the this BCH shit split and I saw the parasites hunger for MONEY HONEY. It has really damaged the entire crypto industry, as no institutional investment would ever occur. WE ARE FAILED

1965 2018-11-15 19:59:04 Yes I am haha. Yes I had some fiat left - and tbh sold some stocks in profit for crypto. Have also some left IF we go to 4.9k. I am here for the long term. tbh wouldn’t have bought anything if market would have been the same like 2 days ago.. imho it’s a gift rn

1971 2018-11-15 19:58:18 On a day when the the market turns red, any crypto-asset that can produce a profit is generally hailed. But when that asset is a stablecoin whose primary directive is to hold fast, it’s hard to know what to make of things.

1975 2018-11-15 19:57:41 Cause they’re at a crypto conference.
1976 2018-11-15 19:57:40 So suddenly crypto isn't just about buying and selling for profit.  We just opened a whole new set of benefits to be derived from it. And  the same can be said for many of the DAPPs coming out on the blockchain.

1993 2018-11-15 19:56:26 Yeah makes sense. I wasnt really crypto evangelizing just thought it was interesting how hard it is to switch the status quo but once it occurs we (as society) forget very quickly what the pre-status-quo even was. (i.e. fiat, nation-states etc)
1994 2018-11-15 19:56:19 Hocam ya piyasa bittiyse 
1995 2018-11-15 19:56:06 I guess I'm underestimating the number of "active traders" in crypto.  Also don't forget that these  traders also need dumb money to buy their bags (aka retail).  Good luck finding new suckers in 2019.

2023 2018-11-15 19:53:25 Yeah, its over. Bitcoin ABC won. But this battle presented very ugly face of crypto that just like centralized systems here also the decisions reside with few who hold the mining power. Future of crypto in hands of few wealthy miners? Is this decentralization??
2024 2018-11-15 19:53:16 Hadi inşallah

2029 2018-11-15 19:52:29 I might seem idiot but i have a question, if someone “ craig wright” wants to drive the price down, how would he achieve it?By flushing huge amount of btc in market right?
What makes him sure that another group or groups of whales wont party with each other to counter his move ??
2030 2018-11-15 19:52:26 faketoshi and his "whale" posse never even had a chance to pull of suck an attack...he was just full of bs, like he always is, who even takes him serious? hopefully from today on, he will go live in a hole and leave crypto space...

2034 2018-11-15 19:51:30 Take a journey back in crypto .
2035 2018-11-15 19:51:29 First of all, it's more secure to use crypto. It's really hard to impersonate or hack a player wallet.
2036 2018-11-15 19:51:12 I think that this is a new step in the development of the crypto market.
2037 2018-11-15 19:51:10 @mealpal the latest UI change isn't good. It introduced 4 more taps to get to the feature I use daily. It doubled the amount of necessary user input. Bad UX decision.
2038 2018-11-15 19:51:03 But using open source smart contracts organizers can pay prizes globally for fractions of a penny. There can be a permanent record of matches, disputes and rulings, and transparent proof of prizes being paid. On a crypto pegged to the USD, EUR or any currency you like, instantly.
2039 2018-11-15 19:50:47 Given that we went from short vol FinTwit to crypto FinTwit to weed stock FinTwit in the span of 18 months, I’m convinced I can make this happen.

2047 2018-11-15 19:50:02 It's an ICU!
2048 2018-11-15 19:50:02 co-founder of @teamsempo here: getting stores to accept crypto is still quite a labour intensive process - we basically have to guarantee that we’ll act as an exchange. It’s hard, but an order of magnitude easier than trying to get cash to individual refugees!
2049 2018-11-15 19:50:02 Doesn't it worry you that you can just take over all the hashrate after bitcoin sv had it the day before? No it doesn't because your #bcash is as centralized as fiat with just you and jihad controlling it. That's why my money won't go to #BCH.
2050 2018-11-15 19:49:56 I'll clarify my point. You responded to Chris saying that you are against crypto being used as prize money at all. And this appears to be simply because there are quite a lot of scams around in crypto, and the price is volatile.
2051 2018-11-15 19:49:41 But Euci, I’m getting more #crypto it’s beginning to look a lot like Cryptmas!  

Soon the bulls will return... take a look at Bakkt and $btc...glistening once again!

2064 2018-11-15 19:48:44 BTW I'm the CEO of @MetaCert which is the company that built Cryptonite. Most people don't know that.

What's funny, is that some Cryptonite users think that Twitter is the one doing the annotations for verified accounts. 
2065 2018-11-15 19:48:43 In July 2018, the #IRS Large Business and International Division announced a campaign focused on #cryptocurrency transactions. The IRS has also recently announced the hiring of 250 new #SpecialAgents.

2072 2018-11-15 19:48:17 Just made a life-changing decision - if #Crypto makes me enough money then I will move to Canada  - I fell in love with Vancouver back in mid nineties and really should have moved across then - still better late than never and that’s if they’ll have me ? If not then it’ll be 
2073 2018-11-15 19:48:12 Bitcoin is done time for its slow death
2074 2018-11-15 19:48:11 True enough. Revolut actually has the power to dominate if they expanded cryptocurrency functionality. Presently you can only buy and sell, but that is likely due to how Revolut is regulated. 

That said, when crypto-regs land, Revolut is in a 10/10 position.
2075 2018-11-15 19:48:09 @IOHK_Charles any word on Metaps Plus? Is it still going live on 30th of November? Thanks so much Charles! You and the Cardano Team are winners!!  Keep up the amazing work!

2083 2018-11-15 19:47:40 “I’m passionate about this project”

Is “passion” the right word? Or is “interest” more accurate?

I think I’m more interested in crypto, rather than passionate.

What I’m passionate about is my faith and family.

What are you in terms of crypto?

2094 2018-11-15 19:46:51 Hum aparently not only price manipulation is affecting BTC but tax bills are involved,there is also the fact that google is baninng cryptocurrency ads in the near future. Then again Chine lifted the Ban in Crypto and the market is booming over there. A bubble is on its way.
2095 2018-11-15 19:46:48 How long can you keep buying the hash?
2096 2018-11-15 19:46:41 Can confirm. He is great!
2097 2018-11-15 19:46:35 Also, that hashtag is the closest I can get to a new episode of the X-Files.
2098 2018-11-15 19:46:19 Is that an ICO?
2099 2018-11-15 19:46:15 closely related: we require a higher burden of proof for the non-status-quo. Depending on the context this is a feature, not a flaw. 

Very interesting to note that using the broadest context, crypto is closer to the status-quo (gold) being non-fiat. More of recency bias thing.
2100 2018-11-15 19:46:12 Stock markets go green. Crypto is still bleeding. However, crypto community stays still positive!

2107 2018-11-15 19:45:14 By faketoshi you mean $BTC?
2108 2018-11-15 19:45:04 When crypto is heavily regulated in a couple of years, I want people to remember back to the time when there was a public threat (and possible action) of a 51% attack. How anyone can buy this coin after all of this is beyond me.
2109 2018-11-15 19:44:41 When you say opaque network do you mean crypto that utilizes privacy? xmr, zec, xzc...et al? Or do you mean something else?

2116 2018-11-15 19:43:50 As I stand in line donating plasma to buy more. Most of you fail at this. Crypto first needs distribution and we will make it so with stronger hands and an ability to survive without using our funds

let's not forget either that it's only in your pool;)
2122 2018-11-15 19:42:37 But you didn't warn them off ALL of esports. That's my point. Where as here, instead of warning people "hey most these cryptos are just gonna screw you" you replied elsewhere suggesting that all of crypto is bad. When in fact crypto can help solve a lot of problems in esports.

2124 2018-11-15 19:42:29 An interesting phenomena in crypto is that we call BTC deflationary/a hedge against inflation, etc. 

Yes, the supply will eventually be finite, and emissions are controlled by code. But BTC is inflationary until 2140, when the final block reward occurs. Anybody disagree?
2125 2018-11-15 19:42:17 Thanks for your amazing content and invaluable lessons! I developed a strategy and started with a small amount, worked well for months but struggled the last weeks. Guess I'll refine/restructure a bit and test and try again till I'm happy. Learning every day!
2126 2018-11-15 19:41:55 Ok, I looked. And then I couldn’t look away. But what does DEW actually stand for?

I’m an arrogant piece of shit who needs a lot of attention in the crypto space. I will fake that I’m Satoshi and yell it everywhere I can, nevertheless not being able to move a single Satoshi from my wallet address and now taking credit for market dumps on “my creation”
2168 2018-11-15 19:37:15 Good proje Aelf coin süper proje
2169 2018-11-15 19:37:12 $ETH 2.00% move in last 60 minutes.  Last price: $178.50.  $ETHUSD #ETHUSD #ETH #Ethereum #Ether #coinbase #gdax
2170 2018-11-15 19:37:05 Yes for the majority of your portfolio but crypto has higher return potential, even today after arguably the greatest wealth creation that has already occurred, but it comes with a ton of risk. Will be watching to see when you dip your toes in.
2171 2018-11-15 19:36:59 Look at my feed and fraction: number of posts about cryptocurrency / number of posts about blockchain. When the numerator is higher, crypto is rising, when the denominator is higher, crypto is falling

2174 2018-11-15 19:36:42 Yeah but you're comparing Bitcoin to Apple pay. If you want to talk about ease of use,  why don't you compare Bitcoin to credit cards? People will give you money to open a credit card and you dont need a phone.
2175 2018-11-15 19:36:37 Nice
2176 2018-11-15 19:36:35 This is my 1st anniversary in Crypto!!!  #xrp #xrp #xrp #xrp boom it!!!!!This is looking good to me. Let the others fight it out for second place. #Patients #commitment #dedication

Not everyone in Bitcoin is a maximalist. I trade forex, stocks, and crypto.
2180 2018-11-15 19:35:55 Since inception, our team at @CoinvestHQ have focused on engineering. We never speculate on price or comment on $COIN.

Unlike many crypto companies, we are not marketers or financial analysts. We are technologists that build product and let the results take care of themselves.
2181 2018-11-15 19:35:51 Absolutely. People need to keep their eyes on the big picture and think long term

2183 2018-11-15 19:35:25 It may all seem like Crypto is ending following #BrexitDeal strides but I assure us once more that patience and courage is key.
2184 2018-11-15 19:35:24 More good news! This project has a great social importance and I am very confident in it because of its clear vision and strong team.

2190 2018-11-15 19:34:47 What’s worse is the number of ways crypto fanatics gets screwed and they don’t even know it. I wouldn’t touch any of those exchanges with a ten foot pole.
2191 2018-11-15 19:34:36 I start in crypto in December and got my first XRP for just under $1, my XRP bag is now 7x larger and I haven’t finished.
Don’t own any BTC coz don’t see the point when u can have XRP!
2192 2018-11-15 19:34:29 Amongst all the red and the salt I will say I have met some life long friends in this space... The conferences will be just an excuse to see them.

2203 2018-11-15 19:33:27 All crypto to crypto transactions are taxable events. This is a common misconception among traders. However, if you simply have entered a position and have not made any movement (either crypto-crypto or crypto-fiat) there will be no taxable event.

2214 2018-11-15 19:31:56 Bitcoin is getting easier and stronger. 

Don’t confuse scam coins like BCH for “crypto” or bitcoin.

If you want to chase tinpot scammer conspiracy theories that rabbit hole is bottomless... and you deserve your confusion for giving them credence.
2215 2018-11-15 19:31:42 No, it's very relevant.

If you're someone buying the XRP token with the expectation that it will appreciate, then I'd want to know whether it's actually used for settling payments. If something else outside of $XRP is used, as a hold I'd want to know
2216 2018-11-15 19:31:40 Top!!

2221 2018-11-15 19:31:17 If you're feeling nervous about crypto's recent dip, remember:

1. Yale's endowment invested in 2 crypto funds
2. Fidelity built a custody solution
3. BTC has survived 10 years and countless (much larger) dips

Don't confuse price with value - crypto is growing every day.

2244 2018-11-15 19:28:25 Regardless, Arianna, it’d be interesting to hear your view as well about how long you expect inefficiencies in the crypto market to provide funds the potential for success that the historical data shows isn’t there in the equities markets.

2252 2018-11-15 19:26:54 Crypto’s to action
2253 2018-11-15 19:26:35 Meanwhile you can buy a $100 Samsung phone, and pay with NFC like Apple pay does but also pay on the card reader which Apple cannot do. Sorry Apple, your $1,300 phone doesn't have the adequate technology as Samsung's low-end phones.
2254 2018-11-15 19:26:28 Have either of you used the Chrome Extension for Cryptonite?  It seems like a good product but I haven’t gone through the code yet.  I’m wary of extensions from small independent companies, especially in this space.
2255 2018-11-15 19:26:20 @rogerkver You are a cheater! With renting hash without permission you prove yourself!

@ProfFaustus
2256 2018-11-15 19:26:02 Yes, and the crypto story resonated with anyone who had played online games that have there own "GameBucks"  Basically, on of those game tokens took off and went supernova created a cloud of chasers/wheres the next 100x rip?
2257 2018-11-15 19:25:32 The same reason anonymity is important for OPSEC with Crypto is the same reason wearing crypto merch isn't the smartest move.
2258 2018-11-15 19:25:26 Sounds like you playing your CT self 
2259 2018-11-15 19:25:24 The only way you can use Apple pay is with NFC technology. If you don't have that technology than Apple pay is useless. If you are going to compare a payment system you should bring up Samsung pay because it can actually be used on card readers, apple sucks...
2260 2018-11-15 19:25:10 @Journalancer Hey Sead, I'm working with @Decryptz which has social sentiment data from Twitter on a coin and sector basis. Can I connect you to the CEO? Great person to talk re: trends and getting ahead of this latest crypto rout. LMK and I will arrange
2261 2018-11-15 19:25:09 CoinGeek and BMG hashpower seems missing-in-action. And none of the ABC pundits seem to have noticed. I have the feeling we're going to get a lesson in crypto monetary policy and why hash is king courtesy of @ProfFaustus and @nChainGlobal.

2274 2018-11-15 19:23:30 No, what will be sad is @CoinMarketCap will likely continue running the ads regardless allowing them the chance to con more folks.

CMC should revoke the ads as soon as they're found to be a scam.
2275 2018-11-15 19:23:26 It’s volatile and could move a lot within hours, certainly. Another concern is that teams must then take crypto and use an exchange to get fiat (USD/EUR). That’s not a fun/familiar process for most.

2282 2018-11-15 19:22:38 David, as a long-time passive investor, that view on hedge fund rings clear. I think a more interesting question is whether indexing in crypto (e.g. the Bitwise HOLD10) makes sense, and would likely provide a better risk-adjusted return than holding, stay, just Bitcoin.

2294 2018-11-15 19:21:17 It's been since January that we were at $19k. Things were good then, I thought we were going to the moon... 

Still, the price is down more than 70% from $19k. I just didn't know if I could take it any longer. I panic sold. 

Sorry fiat, I need to load up on some more crypto.

2300 2018-11-15 19:20:24 my faith in Justin and his hot air ballon is gone. Crypto will surely go back up. But i have serious doubts that trx will ever again climb to where it was in january. And there will be other new firefly’s just like it the next year aswell.

2319 2018-11-15 19:18:08 And that comes as a surprise? They probably copy pasted the logo list from any other random legit service..

2323 2018-11-15 19:17:12 #Bitcoin's low volume makes it easy for a large holder to push down the price and cause more selling. As investment funds prepare to enter the market, this is exactly what they want. Throw in a little FUD and you have a great buying opportunity. This pattern is clear. #Crypto

2350 2018-11-15 19:12:41 crypto-native crowd is happy to be their own "bank" and hold private keys. 

My question is: can we educate masses (in reasonable timeframe), or will be crypto apps resemble existing app experience?
2351 2018-11-15 19:12:28 LOL....wow, surprise surprise that traditional banking is writing negatively about crypto.  You guys are really running out of steam!
2352 2018-11-15 19:12:26 I went on the SUB telegram group and asked about the roadmap since it was outdated. People jumped at my neck telling me that the info was everywhere.

2371 2018-11-15 19:09:26 Such as strange and hypocritical view from someone who clearly adopted esports early when it was full of scams, companies and individuals with malicious intent. If it was measurable I'd be that more money is lost/stolen in USD/GBP/EUR than in all crypto combined for pro players.

2384 2018-11-15 19:08:06 @mappopk_crypto Good luck
2385 2018-11-15 19:08:03 A scam
2386 2018-11-15 19:08:01 SVpool just dropped 4 blocks at once. Hinting that they are mining blocks covertly. It's possible they're mining the ABC chain covertely and *if* they are generating more PoW than the current chain, they can do a reorg attack the same way invalidating these blocks by @BitcoinCom
2387 2018-11-15 19:07:54 I like when crypto dudes with highly evolved theories about the future of money and the structure of civilization start talking about the 200-day moving average. It's humanizing.

2394 2018-11-15 19:06:36 A common misconception is that crypto stands for cryptocurrency while it's about cryptography 
2395 2018-11-15 19:06:30 Something like how PirateBay used to use people's computers for crypto mining?

2400 2018-11-15 19:06:12 Also their payment processor blows, you have to use a wallet with their payment protocol integrated. I tried to pay for something on Newegg with BTC and don’t use any of their supported wallets so ended up having to use my card.. so much for facilitating adoption

2404 2018-11-15 19:05:32 How about a solution for burning houses, perhaps a fire proof parachute that fires off via miniature rocket from the roof and covers the entire property and can be repacked after each use.

2407 2018-11-15 19:05:15 I feel that this is only something that would affect the network at this stage--still in early growth. As Tron becomes bigger, it quickly becomes impossible for a single person to take control.
2408 2018-11-15 19:05:12 You mean the 99% didn't invest close to trillion dollars in less than a month into crypto?


Never would have guessed

2409 2018-11-15 19:05:11 It's not longing 5.4k that is crowded it's the fact that everybody is countertrading CNBC. Without even watching the charts.

If you read the rest of the tweet, I said that after all it's a good setup for a retest of 5.8/6k. 

I just don't automatically countertrade CNBC anymore.
2410 2018-11-15 19:05:07 Is there any algorithm that doesn't support pooled mining?
That would be more closer to decentralization.

2447 2018-11-15 19:00:45 No chain should be attacked simply because you disagree with it. That is the beauty of crypto, the freedom of creation and choice.

2478 2018-11-15 18:57:17 The Crypto Market seems to be following the Stock Market (Dow). The Stock Market has been going down for the past week. 
Today is the first day in the past week that the Stock Market has been going up. Lets see if the Crypto Market follows the Stock Market and recovers.
2479 2018-11-15 18:56:50 As the market nears bottom, institutions start to look into crypto, what small cap coin could they have their eye on and why?  Let’s just say $WSX @WeAreSatoshi is well prepared and ready

1st: without satoshi there would be no market
2nd: every coin or token is connected to bitcoin not fiat
3rd: this is crypto space, no fiat market, no measurement in Fiat, no trading of altcoin with fiat

2572 2018-11-15 18:46:38 Trading cost for anything on your exchange is 100% of your deposit because you hold withdrawals for OVER 30 days!!!! #cryptobulls #BitcoinCash $btc $tron $ltc #skycoin $sky #bitcoinprice
2573 2018-11-15 18:46:30 I think so too!  We are loaded with more $OCN than we deserve....
2574 2018-11-15 18:46:29 Yeah I know
2575 2018-11-15 18:46:28 Dayum birbie it feels like Bitcoin is listening to you.. you were right. But now it is enough :)
2576 2018-11-15 18:46:22 We’ve seen intentional BGP leaks targeting crypto currencies for sure. They are usually more targeted and clever. This does not appear to have been one of those. Of note, NgNOG had happened a week earlier and the Nigerian ISP was in the process of turning up CT transit.

2582 2018-11-15 18:45:49 How many more fake BTC do we need? Start printing press we not changing anything. Why crypto is any better?
2583 2018-11-15 18:45:43 Ultimately its the crypto investors who would suffer with BCHfork.
Craig, Bitmain and Rog ver would walkout unscratch out of it.

2585 2018-11-15 18:45:35 Think about why national currency of Venezuela is such a bad store of value. And why no country in the world wants to have one and only USD as the only currency and the only store of value. And what crypto has to do with that.

2589 2018-11-15 18:45:00 BIS doesn't get to decide what's people's money.  Crypto is sound money using top notch tech. BTW, your propaganda "paper" is full of BS as well.
2590 2018-11-15 18:44:58 It's true though and #HODLHurts. 20-50% "dips" are one thing 95% is frankly painful.
2591 2018-11-15 18:44:51 Xrp continues to overtake eth as 2nd most profitable crypto...
2592 2018-11-15 18:44:39 I'm afraid the more "forks" we create the more we water down our #crypto #economy system.  A house divided against itself cannot stand.
2593 2018-11-15 18:44:30 Please continue to make all of the crypto space look bad just to benefit yourself

2600 2018-11-15 18:43:27 In London, a few days ago, there was a talk on "Crypto 2.0", linked to stablecoins. This server refers "Crypto 3.0" linked to digital value structures in networks imbricated in the "disruptions complex". Chris Skinner says that in the future there will be no money, no data ...
2601 2018-11-15 18:43:15 Unpopular opinion: for crypto to reach billions of users, tokens and private keys will be abstracted from UX/UI.
2602 2018-11-15 18:43:08 It is the electricity of the future. Currently it is BASHED HARD because of all the scam ICO's that happened in late 2017, early-mid 2018. Now, the number of ICO's has diminished due to a decrease of crypto-hype

When it comes back and stays (aka adoption), we will see $ETH again

2635 2018-11-15 18:39:04 After this 'crypto crash' settles, we will see who the real winner is. I hold both $XRP and $ETH

If 1 person can that easily get a hold of more hashrate than the entire chain had the day before then that clearly shows how cheap it is to attack that…
2645 2018-11-15 18:36:49 Historically every time Bitcoin has traded below mining cost, it has always been a good investment.
2646 2018-11-15 18:36:45 Do a crypto airdrop. It’s way more effective than partnering with many of these governments. #cryptocurrency
2647 2018-11-15 18:36:43 Not at all. BTC is + EV
2648 2018-11-15 18:36:31 Only 15 cryptos now have more than $1 billion market cap. This generally seen as a rough measure of the legitimacy and viability of a crypto, at least in terms of its being a store of value or investment opportunity.

2720 2018-11-15 18:28:43 You have to admit @JuanSGalt no matter what side(s) you support in crypto this happening is amazing to watch. 


2721 2018-11-15 18:28:43 hey adrian, this is so sweet of you 
2722 2018-11-15 18:28:40 plus ça va et plus le stalinisme disparaît dans les poubelles de l'histoire, plus les comportements crypto staliniens sont copié-collé pr justifier l'exclusion de tel ou telle du débat. Mais l'islamo gauchisme ressemble furieusement à un avatar de l'hitléro-titisme en fait
2723 2018-11-15 18:28:35 I see... Not everybody would keep this joke running though. Her "expertise" is nowhere near the other two you mentioned.
2724 2018-11-15 18:28:21 There is more to life than your net worth. Please be smart and safe during this tough time in crypto and holiday season. #cryptoking

2755 2018-11-15 18:25:21 TFW after 2 law firms call out of the blue to ask how you can seize a cryptocurrency wallet, if there's a warrant issued, and then it all makes sense in a weird kind of way (cuz there's an ICO shop, a crypto whale who owns a racist soccer team and a binary option firm involved)
2756 2018-11-15 18:25:19 No
2757 2018-11-15 18:25:18 Indeed. Time to retrospect where crypto is headed.
2758 2018-11-15 18:25:14 It will not in near future either, crypto codes can be used for commercial purposes but until & unless big governments won’t own it, it will stay a tool of betting alone.

2762 2018-11-15 18:25:08 Ich bin kein Trader, ich bin ein early adopter. Aber momentan ein #neonocoiner. Viel zu viel Betrug und Manipulation im Crypto Space. Aber ich denke auch das BTC noch 50% verlieren wird, oder so.
2763 2018-11-15 18:25:05 (#3) (Still TBD if stablecoins will work, even 1:1 fiat-backed still a mess.) Other short term factors like the fork and possible whale manipulation is all conjecture. 
4. ****The success of crypto and the use of “blockchain” in enterprise are only very tangentially related.***
2764 2018-11-15 18:24:39 They are trying to kill BitcoinCash. Lol

2770 2018-11-15 18:24:30 is this just for when someone cashes out crypto to fiat? or do you have to report what u purchased even if it's at a loss now and youre hodl'n ?
2771 2018-11-15 18:24:29 @Ripple_Me_This Is it concerning that BTC and ETH are having issues with world use. Just because of crypto pairings? Such as XRP/BTC and XRP/ETH or am I lost in the understanding of it? Don't we need XRP with more stable coin pairings?
2772 2018-11-15 18:24:29 2500 watching #tothelifeboats with a tin hat and @Ripple_Me_This and I am one of them
2773 2018-11-15 18:24:18 (#2) 2. Relating to #1, ignore the people telling you to buy dips and crypto being on sale. Many of these people were saying same in January and July.
3. Biggest fundamental reasons for price declines: Crypto still hasn’t cracked the code on means of exchange & store of value.

2781 2018-11-15 18:23:20 THREAD (#1): My thoughts about the recent crypto price implosion:

1. No one knows where this is going, don’t believe any “experts” that say they do, even if they are “experts” & sound smart.
2782 2018-11-15 18:23:17 I can't believe no one has done this before tbh. 

Looking at past Reddit posts on the matter it seems as if BO3 Cryptokeys were earned around the rate of 2.9 Crypto across a 10-minute game if you won said game. That's around 1hr 40mins of gameplay for 30 Cryptokeys.
2783 2018-11-15 18:23:14 Not everyone gets the ‘coin’ ref! lol
Just glad you got sorted! Nothing worse than lost crypto!

2797 2018-11-15 18:21:58 Lol
2798 2018-11-15 18:21:57 How can a narcissistic and egomaniacal liar like Craig Wright get enough hashpower behind him to even make this a close horse race? 

It's disheartening that so many large miners have no morals, and are driven exclusively by profit.

2820 2018-11-15 18:19:21 just bought some crypto for the first time in a long while

and it sure felt fine
2821 2018-11-15 18:19:18 They are definitely related. I just personally think that mainstream adoption isn’t where it is because of scaling problems which, to your point, can create a bad UX. I think it’s because a generally poor UX means less tinkering by potential new adopters. We’ll get there in time.
2822 2018-11-15 18:18:59 A crypto cannot be in a financial crisis
2823 2018-11-15 18:18:48 I think they can't afford to print your name on the card.
2824 2018-11-15 18:18:48 Let this week be a lesson that no one should be calling bottom in crypto. If they do, it's BS. Strive to mitigate risk and win more than 50% of the time.
2825 2018-11-15 18:18:41 Suspect you’re onto something there...

2844 2018-11-15 18:17:05 #Blockchain #Crypto Owning a whole bitcoin is still economically within reach for most people. This is crazy. Few realize how scarce bitcoin really is. In five years the concept of owning a whole bitcoin will be nothing but a dream for those who don't act now.

2848 2018-11-15 18:16:48 I look forward to the day when "crypto" will no longer be a shorthand reference to this failing fintech experiment known as cryptocurrency. Instead it will refer once again to cryptography. We need quantum computing for the reset.

2861 2018-11-15 18:15:40 9 days ago to be precise.
2862 2018-11-15 18:15:19 Developers must "mind the gap" regarding cryptocurrency. Specifically, they must know there is a gap between the unrealistic claims of crypto promoters and the utter uselessness of cryptocurrency in reality.
2863 2018-11-15 18:15:16  Retail needs to not completely exit looking for a better entry. Institutions and whales are gobbling up cheap $BTC and retail will come in later for less BTC. Oh well what am I doing telling retail what to do — they’ll do what they do.

2879 2018-11-15 18:14:06 Covert Narcissists are shamelessly two-faced crypto-predators. Their secret goal is to somehow maneuver their prey of choice into being fully & factually honest with them, whilst they simultaneously manage to never divulge anything of value about themselves that is actually true.

2881 2018-11-15 18:13:40 Just received a letter from the low-life's over at @FundingCircleNL @JeroenWilliam offering a 100k loan for 5.79% annual interest. Probably the most moronic spam I have seen in months, this includes all the crypto scams on CT. These scumbags can't even print a letter properly.

2925 2018-11-15 18:09:17 This fork proves how little Craig Wright  @ProfFaustus cares about the health of the crypto space and how conceited he is in his own idealogy. 

It also shows how the majority of big miners are only interested in profits. They do not care about validity, ideologies or the truth

I know the next thing that you would like me to talk about would be which cryptos to choose for running a masternode or some of you would also like to know how to identify if the crypto in which one has already invested allows running a masternode. #Masternodes

2962 2018-11-15 18:04:36 Sounds familiar. They ignore emails and they block/erase/ban you from their telegram ifbyou ask for help.  An employee stole a bunch of BTC from them and now they are trying to fix it by stealing others from their customers.

2970 2018-11-15 18:03:58 We can learn a lot from this. The consensus mechanism for bcash is basically the same as in bitcoin. The fact that the cheap (loser) fork is the one with the largest hash rate is something that I don't recall ever happening in crypto.
2971 2018-11-15 18:03:56 What they're doing is capitalism. And it's beneficial. People don't have LN nodes because they don't know how, but they will now. the casa team thinks their effort in bringing it to market is worth 300$ and the markets decide. If you dissagree, do it cheaper. I for one wouldn't.

3010 2018-11-15 18:00:35 1. #Turkey:
IMO 2016 Russian intel likely cracked crypto ap & saw chatter between Gulanist officers. GRU tipped Erdogan & used the hack to cause actions to start a coup to wipe out opposition to Erdogan and his ISIS/Al-Qaeda allies. The Coup was fake. but purged pro-NATO officers

3030 2018-11-15 17:58:29 Then crypto isn’t doing what it’s meant to do.

3034 2018-11-15 17:58:10 well no actually free movement has led to people who work in our NHS and actually this has happened over many years -I worked 20 years ago in NHS with folks from Germany and Spain and we had students from Greece too -was great- EU27 have been shown to pay higher taxes than UK etc
3035 2018-11-15 17:57:59 Lots of new interesting projects. Building is the way to go. Real and sustainable growth is achieved by working on infrastructure. This industry shouldn't be defined by price or speculation. 

#bitcoin #crypto #infrastructure #sustainablegrowth #LightningNetwork 
3036 2018-11-15 17:57:42 Another thing to understand here is that you should choose the right currency for investment if you are solely investing in running a masternode. You should compare the percentage yield against the investment. In short, you should smartly calculate your ROI. #Masternodes
3037 2018-11-15 17:57:14 Very demoralizing..After sustaining 6k a half dozen times in the last 9 months we all were convinced of a bottom.. This is gonna get pretty ugly now, alts will bleed real bad.. Btc and crypto as a whole may not bounce back until next year.. All you can do is hodl
3038 2018-11-15 17:57:08 It being a dinosaur is what will be its saving grace. When the masses get into crypto they will move toward choosing BTC for their retirement portfolio as it is a store of value. Search BiChip, XRP, BTC, doubt they spent $ on making that product based on speculation alone, IMO.
3039 2018-11-15 17:56:50 To be fair, that is a UK type joke. You may not get it being from SA.

3110 2018-11-15 17:50:29 Crypto is a con. Silicon Valley is swimming in QE cash from the Fed. Their stocks are jacked through the roof. They’ve gone mad and turned the coin craze into a get rich quick scheme.

3112 2018-11-15 17:50:23 SV and friends mined 21 of the last 26 blocks this war is not on social media let’s see who mined blocks!!!
3113 2018-11-15 17:50:10 And the not so funny part is that Institutions will NEVER embrace cryptos after this ridiculous theatrical drama which shows how easy is to manipulate tokens. Forget the SEC will approve BTC ETF after this shit show

3147 2018-11-15 17:47:41 And we thought crypto is volatile...
3148 2018-11-15 17:47:37 Yes, BCH will rule :)
3149 2018-11-15 17:47:33 The crypto space is so cutthroat. Lots of folks shilling their investments, others out there calling people "scammers" while shilling their own shit. It's all one big attempt to get people to buy in. That understood, best to ride the calls, take out initial and keep going.
3150 2018-11-15 17:47:31 In a way, crypto is behaving like any other political/social system: different quality governance systems produce different quality results.

Politics is a way of balancing competing objectives within a governance system. Ergo, politics is governance.
3151 2018-11-15 17:47:31 Awesome!
3152 2018-11-15 17:47:30 so are you ready when CSW makes good on his promise to tank the value of $BTC and drag the entire crypto market in the #PoW hash war mud? #BitcoinCash #BillionaireMode #StoreOfDrama 
3153 2018-11-15 17:47:27 this is not even POW its POSM

3158 2018-11-15 17:46:59 @StexExchangeR Is awesome , I trade a large portion of my portfolio over there. The volume is a tad low,  but that can sometimes be an advantage depending on how you trade. Also they have an array of hidden gems  like $rpm $kbg $btk $bca $dart $evi $zues

3165 2018-11-15 17:46:45 talking about property rights. Who is the owner of the Bitcoin Blockchain?
3166 2018-11-15 17:46:43 I think you're right regarding the EU scaring others into not leaving
3167 2018-11-15 17:46:42 Now that bitcoin has made an extremely relevant move - I can finally upload a chart showing my loose plan and direction for buying this bottom. #bitcoin #vision2020
3168 2018-11-15 17:46:27 Keep them running for more than a day tough boy...
3169 2018-11-15 17:46:22 Is she a millennial?  I've never had a woman ghost me b/c of bitcoin/crypto.  In fact, it's usually the opposite.  Perhaps she thinks bitcoin destroy's the environment.
3170 2018-11-15 17:46:20 
3171 2018-11-15 17:46:20 True I probably woulda bought x bch and shorted the same amount at the same time to lock that price in and take both forks and and eat the ~30% for tax. Too late now tho 
3172 2018-11-15 17:46:06 Who buy's porn anymore? I mean who pays for it? pornhub, xtube, etc.

3175 2018-11-15 17:45:49 Too, I'm pretty sure it's only two coins: BCH becomes BCHABC and BCHSV. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong.
3176 2018-11-15 17:45:48 Now its too late to invest but you should come upto speed on it...Blockchain is real technology and crypto currencies are here to stay

3180 2018-11-15 17:45:35 This presents clearly what @bytemaster7 has been saying all along, "He who has the most resources, owns the chain." Whats to say a shadow government can't acquire enough hash to create the longest chain? Under the guise of SV or ABC or or or...

3195 2018-11-15 17:44:05 Soon he will own all the bitcoins because you idiots keep using betmex instead of holding the real asset. Then Arthur can dump/blackmail control the entire marking. You are all giving him the power to destroy crypto.
3196 2018-11-15 17:43:58 Do need
3197 2018-11-15 17:43:54 Yh only in your little pool.
3198 2018-11-15 17:43:53 As a big blocker I think most in the entire crypto space are against him. His ideaology is in direct contradiction to what we believe. Most big and small blockers differ on 5% of their beliefs. Pretty much 95% with Faketoshi
3199 2018-11-15 17:43:52 Ditto
3200 2018-11-15 17:43:51 It's all fake - will never happen, was never going to happen  - 2nd referendum will vote remain - and all the other countries in EU will be scared of leaving due to the nightmare.  Problem Reaction Solution.....wake up people.  These people aren't in power.

3208 2018-11-15 17:43:17 Ah the hilary defense "i was awful so let me blame others for my loss" lmao
3209 2018-11-15 17:43:17 My point is merely if crypto (whether it is btc, bch, or something else) requires us to put trust into the hands of a few people (usually comp sci people, not even econ or finance backgrounds) then we are royally fucked. Crypto cannot survive that way
3210 2018-11-15 17:43:17 #BadTimesToSayCongrats  When I buy my first #bitcoin & it drops $1000 in 24Hrs #cryptocurrencies #Crypto
3211 2018-11-15 17:43:16 But it's the real Bitcoin
3212 2018-11-15 17:43:16 Forking fork forked you up.
3213 2018-11-15 17:43:15 Reloaded some $XSN around 2200 sat. Lord I very appreciated this move !
3214 2018-11-15 17:43:09 If you moved other’s hash without permission. That is not freedom. That is stealing. Stealing means revenge . I think you know that.

3216 2018-11-15 17:43:06 I'm amazed that Don could completely ignore the legality aspects of DSV etc.  Law is a slow moving beast but a beast nonetheless; it can't simply be ignored.
3217 2018-11-15 17:43:00 What the Fuck is wrong with you guys? Bitcoin Cash wasn't enough of a cheap a**name for a BTC Fork Now they are coming up with a kindergarten name for their New #BCH Fork! If BCH is Great why a fork? @rogerkver Gonna double his holdings for free Before dumping BCHABC @crypto
3218 2018-11-15 17:42:58 So is the real world use - Beanies at this second being scanned without customers may even know a thing about prices, crypto or blockchain.

3223 2018-11-15 17:42:24 Sure, but the trick would be to dump before everyone else does.  There's also tax implications. Legally(USA), you'd have to declare the forked coin based on the fiat value the day you received it. What you actually do is your own business.

3255 2018-11-15 17:39:58 I think this hash war @nic__carter will be remembered as an important milestone for crypto.

I think it will demonstrate in a material way what we know from theory, that concentration of power in "censorship resistant financial networks" destroys value in the long-term.
3256 2018-11-15 17:39:53 Hahah,,,funnny how you lie....PHOTOSHOP! and fake news
3257 2018-11-15 17:39:51 Yep, 2018 is the end date. Unless I give up in 2014. It depends on how the crypto market is doing, if our youtube channel is still going down in flames, and if nothing else bad happens.

3267 2018-11-15 17:39:02 Hum, qui va demander un paiement en une obscure crypto que personne n'utilisera jamais plutôt qu'en dollars? 
3268 2018-11-15 17:39:02 goood
3269 2018-11-15 17:38:52 I think we can all agree on that, but he answered "Both" to a 2-part question asking if he was against crypto as a form of prize money in general so I was looking to discuss why as I work in both the esports and the crypto industries and am genuinely interested in his opinion.
3270 2018-11-15 17:38:46 Saw the glitch on live stream on youtube. ;) refreshed and it was 276 again. Lol.
3271 2018-11-15 17:38:42 It's what has happened to a majority of the ICO's that have been happening, some have lost 99% of their value but you can forsee a lot of them, some had the team working on it quit it, exit scam etc.

If you're going to pay out in Crypto you do it with Bitcoin or Ethereum
3272 2018-11-15 17:38:39 hahaha, nervous laughter.  It's not silly
3273 2018-11-15 17:38:35 @rogerkver you been "used", now, again?! check your stats.
3274 2018-11-15 17:38:30 Also, BTG has faced challenges in recent months - and survived them all. The "weak hands" in BTG have already been shaken out by circumstances, leaving BTG resilient.

After the Cash wars and this latest market drop, that might be true for the broad crypto market.
3275 2018-11-15 17:38:27 さて
3276 2018-11-15 17:38:25 What is bad for Bcash adoption must be good for LTC adoption, that is if Crypto survives, and we know it will.  Perhaps @bakkt wanted this dust to settle before it kicked off the real football game.  TY Bakkt, good move.  @bensemchee @TylerSCrypto @cryptorecruitr @cryptomanran

3279 2018-11-15 17:38:15 My crypto thought process has always been to go against the collective conscience of the community. I learned this through previous market failure. Learn from your mistakes it is how you succeed. $bch
3280 2018-11-15 17:38:13 This is precisely why nation states can't tolerate the existence of honest currency and will act to destroy rivals to fiat. 

Fort Knox was built to house the gold seized from the population when gold possession became a Felony. 

Crypto will be heavily taxed and or criminalized.
3281 2018-11-15 17:38:08 Roger does it worry you that this entire event proves how centralized $BCH actually is? Doesn't that defeat the entire purpose?
3282 2018-11-15 17:38:04 Isırmaz dimi 
3283 2018-11-15 17:38:01 criminals use photoshop
3284 2018-11-15 17:38:00 Is the "cold war" we are seeing this day, what the$CRYPTO #cryptocurrency need? Is helping in any ways to go ahead with the tech? Is what will give stability? We deserve something better then this! #Tezos $XTZ
3285 2018-11-15 17:37:53 さすがｗｗ
3286 2018-11-15 17:37:52 Its still 276.59
3287 2018-11-15 17:37:50 is not photoshop, it's him manually adapting the stats :P
3288 2018-11-15 17:37:48 Was it actually? I’m checking now and I it says 276 / 236 for BCH / BTC on my screen. This would be a seriously dumb mistake on Roger’s part if it was a glitch surely?
3289 2018-11-15 17:37:47 nice fake!
3290 2018-11-15 17:37:47 Of course we are ;)

3311 2018-11-15 17:36:48 I haven’t slept Actually for more than 36 hours now :-)

But it’s all worth it. About to crash now. Please don’t send #BitcoinCash to Zero 
3312 2018-11-15 17:36:43 Semua crypto adalah masa besar sekarang, membolehkan kesabaran, menyokong projek yang baik dan melabur semula bukan hanya dengan wang tetapi masa dan promosi  # wearetherevolutionofmoney #btk
3313 2018-11-15 17:36:28 Your opinion for QSP has been very useful sir 
3314 2018-11-15 17:36:22 That's not the number I'm seeing. How often does that ticker update?
3315 2018-11-15 17:36:20 Enjoy Greece
3316 2018-11-15 17:36:18 For months all those crypto heads are missing.  Just hearing crickets.
3317 2018-11-15 17:36:17 Love this depressed crypto market bc I can talk about Bitcoin without people asking me how much money I've made
3318 2018-11-15 17:36:16 for a whole hour

good job
3319 2018-11-15 17:36:08 centralizeeeeeed
3320 2018-11-15 17:36:00 On est donc d'accord que si c'est en crypto, ça reste sujet à fluctuation (à moins de cash out immédiatement).
3321 2018-11-15 17:35:53 Now meaning 10 minutes ago, and no more?

3322 2018-11-15 17:35:52 Merci! 
3323 2018-11-15 17:35:51 and after 24h? crying? suicide?
3324 2018-11-15 17:35:46 A single quick burst is meaningless. Hash power doesn't matter if you're not using it to create blocks.
3325 2018-11-15 17:35:37 I’m waiting for the usd stable coin pairing to alts, it’s going to happen very soon. Alts will be able to move like a real market with out attachments to btc, btc will still be holder of value but traded separately like how gold backed the dollar at first

3336 2018-11-15 17:34:50 I like him too, I follow him for a long time before I was on crypto twitter. 

I was so honoured when he started to follow me
3337 2018-11-15 17:34:46 Hey Bitboy, I had a dream the other night that you and I quit crypto and started a band.  Can you sing?  I have a drum set in the basement.
3338 2018-11-15 17:34:45 What surprising? These facts were hidden by CONgress and not brought to the notice of Indian public. Nehru was a crypto-Hindu and an autocrat..
3339 2018-11-15 17:34:42 Did you know you can use a Self Directed IRA to purchase Crypto currency, like Bitcoin?
3340 2018-11-15 17:34:40 I like saying that crypto is a "crash course" in trading.  
3341 2018-11-15 17:34:33 There's no way to rough estimate. Over a year is long term capital gain. If he's from the US he needs to look up a long term capital gain chart. IF that's the way crypto continues to be taxed
3342 2018-11-15 17:34:26 Lol he will blame his failure on crypto

3363 2018-11-15 17:33:47 its just securitized, so they'll hold your crypto in exchange for cash. I would assume with the volatility of crypto it could be abused fairly easily honestly

3378 2018-11-15 17:31:38 Nope. You’re just flat wrong in every way and metric that can be measured. 

But, we’ll agree to disagree and see how much longer POW survives. 

Also, we are all here FOR MONEY. This is investing. Stop being childish.

What'd they buy in again? I think $50? Oh no, selling at 1200 means they only got...24x gains. Yeah. I'd be worried about that forever.

3393 2018-11-15 17:30:09 I hope you are right. I think that by opening the door, they will create the rush to real cryptos. People in the know will be flooding into Bitcoin if they try to issue a banker crypto. When those not in the know (who have heard the word Bitcoin) figure it out, then we're there.

3398 2018-11-15 17:29:30 Agreed, it is a real issue that is tainting the impression of crypto at the moment but I don't believe that it should prevent you from accepting that there are crypto projects out there which are acting with the best interests of their industry and their users.

3413 2018-11-15 17:27:18 Don't let the fact that many cryptocurrency projects are vaporware obscure the fact that many projects are in fact trying to achieve something important and solve the problem of centralised trust. There's lots to be positive about in crypto right now.

1) Never leave the house or stop looking at your computer screen

3433 2018-11-15 17:25:26 I don’t know, this BCH drama v.2.0 is pretty political. The governance process in crypto is much less defined than existing political systems. This allows for experimentation. Most experiments fail. The strongest and the weakest point imo are the developers.

3441 2018-11-15 17:24:00 are digital currencies and crypto both stored on computers & dependent upon the internet?

3452 2018-11-15 17:22:26 I dont understand crypto as I have never really looked into it. But am I correct in saying that $150000 in crypto prize winnings today could be worth $1 at some point if the currency tanks?
3453 2018-11-15 17:22:13 Scalping these 3m charts the past day or so is some of the most fun I've had in #crypto for a long time!
3454 2018-11-15 17:22:13 @HaroldTrader nothing persona taken. Any advice? I love to gain knowledge about the crypto market.
3455 2018-11-15 17:22:05 No. $xrp is more centralized. Stop getting distracted by money
3456 2018-11-15 17:21:57 The scale of the $ is a big difference to me in terms of comparing 2014 to now.
3457 2018-11-15 17:21:52 there is no need to payout in crypto unless it's a shitcoin which they've printed themselves and claim to have market value and volume lol which only low tier tournament organisers would do
3458 2018-11-15 17:21:50 My point exactly! California winemakers are crazy, although you can get decent California wines for around $8-10, like Bogle Wines in nearby Clarksburg (I'm in Sacramento)
3459 2018-11-15 17:21:42 After the slight hiccup with #Bitcoin and #Altcoins recently, do most people still believe #Crypto is the future ??
3460 2018-11-15 17:21:34 Certainly possible or even back to $0.24 if BTC does indeed sink to $4260.
3461 2018-11-15 17:21:30 Many ICO-project frauds are coming now. God, bless the people who did the ICO who gave me back the hope that crypto is the future of humanity, you can try it through this project #tlk
3462 2018-11-15 17:21:27 Always a pleasure to watch! Ty
3463 2018-11-15 17:21:18 I think honestly we will crash down to 3.7k or 4k
3464 2018-11-15 17:20:58 Thanks. Although to be clear, the user would still have to convert the crypto tokens to fiat currency (if that's what they want).
3465 2018-11-15 17:20:58 It's time to decentralize. #crypto is the future. Decentralized apps will be huge and will be unstoppable. We need #crypto. Crypto is our #freedom.

3466 2018-11-15 17:20:56 Wasn't @ltc_angel waiting for 30k just 3 days ago?
3467 2018-11-15 17:20:55 Gayet güzel platform. Forex' de olsaymış 1broker'ı aramazdık.  @Coinocracy burda şimdi btc hala 20K usd mi? düşmüyor dimi :D aylardan Kasım yıllardan daha 17 mi?
3468 2018-11-15 17:20:55 I never really bought into Crypto but I am surprised that its going downhill tho?
3469 2018-11-15 17:20:51 Still buying/hodln  strat?
3470 2018-11-15 17:20:47 Bro dont get me wrong but you are a perma bull. All your TA was bullish in the last weeks/months
3471 2018-11-15 17:20:42 Bought more crypto for the first time in months...  #nogamblenofuture
3472 2018-11-15 17:20:41 Fork oldugu icin kapandi da çok ilginç gerçekten
3473 2018-11-15 17:20:39 Facebook has managed to be concurrently crypto-anti-Semitic and self-Semitic. Wow, they were right: young people really ARE smarter than everyone else!
Wait. @johnlovett  ?!?! Preside…no…kiiiiing of the Screen Actor's Guild?!?!
3474 2018-11-15 17:20:37 Some big investors are taking advantage of the panic sell to massively enter the crypto market. It’s a good sign on the long term.

3477 2018-11-15 17:20:07 This guy is not a good look for the Rs. He is what is known as a crypto-racist. He skirts the boundary of out and out racism in his remarks to indicate what he really thinks about people. Republicans can and should do better than this creepazoid.
3478 2018-11-15 17:20:06 This is my favorite bitcoin meme. I have been doing this all year long
3479 2018-11-15 17:20:00 I’ll sell you a salmon boat.... I need more crypto
3480 2018-11-15 17:19:39 Just finished leg day! 
Hurts like btc. 
3481 2018-11-15 17:19:20 Reboot crypto. End proof of waste

3483 2018-11-15 17:19:16 ViaBTC Bitfinex and BitPay have suspended #BitcoinCash transactions due to the fork, with updates to come #hashwar #crypto #cryptocurrency

3487 2018-11-15 17:18:27 great, my cash for buy is ready 
3488 2018-11-15 17:18:23 So it dawns on me last night as I'm watching Kevin Spacey's movie The BBC, The Billionaire Boy's Club, that within 5 years there will be a new movie called The CBC!  The Crypto Billionaire's Club with XRP in a starring role, and a cameo by the Real Ripple Riddler 
#xrpcommunity
3489 2018-11-15 17:18:15 We sold $ETCG $10.6 today on the seemingly random 7% pop. Until crypto creates an A+ setup, the dump yesterday has this under all MAs and it will likely see pressure in the near term.
3490 2018-11-15 17:18:08 If crypto markets don't see some green soon, we might all have to :D
3491 2018-11-15 17:17:46 Are you against crypto as a form of prize money in general or just against uninformed users using it?
3492 2018-11-15 17:17:36 Gonna keep my eye on $RMESH with gains like 10.44% in past hour #Cryptocurrency #Crypto #blockchain #altcoin #cryptolife #bitcointalk #decentralized
3493 2018-11-15 17:17:23 in the future crypto related Hollywood film who will play the megalomaniac @rogerkver ?
3494 2018-11-15 17:17:22 copy & paste could be a security risk.
3495 2018-11-15 17:17:14 Ration my raman
3496 2018-11-15 17:16:56 they loan money for crypto?
3497 2018-11-15 17:16:51 Maybe not if SV has all the hashing power they claim to have
3498 2018-11-15 17:16:48 This is the right time to say good bye to traditional exchanges. Therefore, join this platform and get the new experience. If you miss, you will regret as a crypto trader! #Dexage #Decentralized #Exchange

3500 2018-11-15 17:16:18 If you are a pro player and you go somewhere and play for crypto as prize money, do not come to me later and complain that you got ripped off and the money was not what you thought it would be.
3501 2018-11-15 17:16:03 More we are dipping

3503 2018-11-15 17:15:58 おっと、monapartyもまだ持ってたか。これはCounterPartyを模造してモナコイン上で独自トークンのやり取りを行えるようにしたトークンだ。一瞬だけ加熱してその後はすっかり誰も使ってないな。燃やしたモナをそのまま売ったらいくらになったか考えるだけで頭が痛くなる…

3505 2018-11-15 17:15:54 i dont even know what that means ive just been waiting to say it

but really though.. get a boat. Im down.
3506 2018-11-15 17:15:43 I think we will have to wait until tomorrow to find out what the fallout is.
3507 2018-11-15 17:15:35 This tweet is gold.
3508 2018-11-15 17:15:34 Wow! They're really pressing to get XRP on top of the crypto chain that they will short the rest of the market.  Well keep trying! AI can't even predict what's going to happen next. Lol!
3509 2018-11-15 17:15:29 It does come from the app! He dropped the notification first on the app which is how I copped mine and then he puts it on twitter!

3511 2018-11-15 17:15:13 In these times of crypto-instability I only see stablecoins, stablecoins everywhere... Oh! don’t forget speculators too, those are the funniest
3512 2018-11-15 17:15:03 一応現物集めたけど
3513 2018-11-15 17:15:01 Because you have to have selected “Notify Me”, but with shock drops there’s no way to select it, unfortunately. This the first time I got lucky with one, but J23 tweet alerted me and I opened the app, copped easy. Madness.
3514 2018-11-15 17:15:00 We are doing research together and calls together transparant as fuck about it

3528 2018-11-15 17:14:28 In this case each coin seems like it is actively trying to destroy the other though.

3537 2018-11-15 17:13:20 thank u for the kind words. I am not interested in followers that much bc i am still learning and use this account to track my crypto journey.
3538 2018-11-15 17:13:16 There’s a lot of shit coins out there. BTC is one of them.
