11 2018-11-08 23:49:37 You are not going to end gun violence.  Do something though.  Bump stocks banned.  Clips with more than 10 bullets banned.  Tax on ammo.  Tax on weapons.  AR-15 banned.  Annul registration fee and license.  Detailed Background Checks.  Federal limits on open carry. etc.

38 2018-11-08 23:44:26 Wow listening to voters being interviewed, whether on TV or in podcasts - damn Kamala's current stump speech is hitting all the marks - economy is only significant for you if you own stocks or have a 401k, most people are a medical emergency away from bankruptcy etc.
39 2018-11-08 23:43:21 There were some great ideas, but we ultimately felt the best one was a standardized process for checking stocks and have scheduled deliveries of medications.

54 2018-11-08 23:31:50 How is this for a relationship. Multiple penny stocks which were thriving due to black money, and whose balance sheet were all but cooked up numbers shot up. Investors money trapped in those stock fell like a pack of cards within few months of DeMo.

70 2018-11-08 23:16:03 This segment right now pushing gun control with Wolf Blitzer and Jackie Speier talking on @CNNSitRoom right now about banning AR-15's, bump stocks, and everything under the sun is ludicrous. The system didn't commit the perpetrator after an evaluation and he used a basic Glock

72 2018-11-08 23:14:18 Or anything else larger for that matter... Just the thought of penny stocks makes me laugh. I'm not a trader to be a hero and pick the next aapl,googl, or amzn... I'm here to capitalize off mid+large caps. That's a skill. Not a lottery like penny stocks.

75 2018-11-08 23:11:45 Last I heard, republicans are in favor of banning bump stocks, improving the NICS system and raising the minimum age to 21.

77 2018-11-08 23:11:24 I'm not at all impressed by his students... I feel bad for all of them. All they know is how to trade penny stocks. No long term investment strategies in place. One day they'll will give their money to someone else to invest for them because they won't know how to trade mid caps.
78 2018-11-08 23:11:05 yeah, it's gonna crater pot stocks for another bottom catch.

85 2018-11-08 23:04:31 Here in Canada, bump stocks are not allowed & there's strict regulations on licensing of semi-automatic rifles. Could be the reason why we haven't had dozens of mass shooting each year. Really don't know what the solution is. I just feel sad for the families who lost loved ones.

87 2018-11-08 23:03:08 It seems his spells are more powerful now though. Even Samus CS does like 40%. I think they are just trying to make the game faster by having stocks be taken quickly. Like Melee.

90 2018-11-08 23:02:03 $ATVI and $TTD both got hammered after market, both great long-term stocks imo! The earnings of $TTD were excellent, as was guidance. But still down 15%.

95 2018-11-08 22:53:42 Vitai is absolutely right, at least as far as stocks are concerned. "Buy low, sell high." There are a LOT of other variables to consider, but that's more or less a mantra. Also, know the company/stock you want to invest in intimately.

98 2018-11-08 22:51:24 That's true, I think that by last year we had become less fearful of seeing the 5-handle (at least in the forecast), especially since Argentina's crop was falling off a cliff and some were discussing Chinese imports 105+ mmt. Theoretically that would have trimmed down stocks.
99 2018-11-08 22:50:58 Maybe.  Fincinals are suppose to come out 195th and they are pushing for earlier.  I was told never buy stocks when financials are due.

101 2018-11-08 22:49:23 ah, i mean i doubt the election results will change but i could be wrong, i’m an expert in stocks but not the best at voting statistics.
102 2018-11-08 22:48:47 Serious question. What would bump stocks have prevented? One more serious question. What makes him a bigot? The final serious question? Where do you work?
103 2018-11-08 22:46:38 Semis have been wrecked, but now is the time to buy. Stocks like $MU, $NVDA, and $AMD are in early innings of secular bull chip market with IOT and Autonomous vehicles and AI, etc. Fundaembtals are good according to analyst and technicals have solid support
104 2018-11-08 22:46:27 You just laid out the case for shorting stocks. .
105 2018-11-08 22:45:52 They’ve disappeared from Boots, Holland and Barret only ever stocks the expensive brands and rarely at all. Never featured in Superdrug, despite their great ethics elsewhere. Why, for gods sakes, do they not stock at least one of the affordable, plastic and poison free options?
106 2018-11-08 22:45:50 This is the perfect time to buy stocks in BJ’s
107 2018-11-08 22:45:18 I know. I’m not saying that banning bump stocks can solve everything but a good start would be having a president that fulfills his promises to everyone, not just the rich and/or bigoted.
108 2018-11-08 22:45:08 Bingo. The problem is with the “a bit” part. In levered system inflated by free money stocks may not stop at “a bit”. Hard to taper a bubble
109 2018-11-08 22:44:52 Stocks don’t always move in the direction you expect. Mr. Market can be irritational and at times longer than you would like. Those are the opportunities that need to be seized.
110 2018-11-08 22:44:30 When Stocks drop like shit. What do you do? #NYSE #Wallstreet #Bitcoin #Gold
111 2018-11-08 22:43:56 A few considerations:
- a handgun does not support the large clips that rifle would
- bump stocks make rapid fire, with large clips viable
- AR15s are not good for hunting, target practice, or other practical purpose
- Assault rifles fetishize mass killing
112 2018-11-08 22:42:38 Rates go up a bit, frothy stocks go down a bit = #Normalisation
113 2018-11-08 22:42:20 This really is the best advice. When I was a beginner I would always be WAY too bias on stocks and that would lead to adding to losers and big blowups... Finally learned to just let the tape and chart tell me where the stock wants to go. No ego, no stress!
114 2018-11-08 22:42:06 Right which the shooter had and are illegal in CA. What about those bump stocks that @realDonaldTrump said that he would ban? So much for his promises made, promises kept BS.
115 2018-11-08 22:41:55 wrong, I trade commodities and FX but I don't hodl them as they are worthless long term; only viable assets such as bitcoin and blue chip stocks deserve long term hodl 
116 2018-11-08 22:41:14 Can an American help me figure out how to fill out an IRS form for selling stocks? I need to sell my shares in Starbucks because I need cash but I can’t unless I submit proof of submitting a tax form? Idk. Y’all confuse me. But I want my $135US 
117 2018-11-08 22:40:09 I totally agree and thank you again for adding more to the tweet. I too wish someone would do something about gun control.  Bump stocks have yet to be banned (as promised).  We just have to be viligent swivel heads.  Stay safe!
118 2018-11-08 22:40:06 I'm pulling the most recent earnings call transcript for one of the companies each student invested in for our portfolio management simulation. Most students invest in $AMZN, $AAPL, $NKE etc. It's not like I have to research 25 obscure stocks!
119 2018-11-08 22:39:59 I know I'm gonna get distracted again like in smash 4.

I'm ready to sacrifice a few stocks to admire the work you've done!
120 2018-11-08 22:39:11 Bi-partisan effort NECESSARY to BAN silencers, bump stocks, cop killer rounds, super shooter magazines, implement COMPREHENSIVE background checks, and disallow cross country concealed carry reciprocity.
121 2018-11-08 22:38:43 Tbh Plat should have RNG solo. Like keep the items baked into autocombo but still implement her NEXT icon or stocks so you know what item she has when you get to it like in CF. Would allow for more creativity, rewarding adaptation, and just be more fun overall
122 2018-11-08 22:37:41 Kim's point is well taken.  Purchase of weapons at gun shows should be eliminated, closing that loop hole.  Bump stocks should be limited to military and law enforcement.

No one needs an assault weapon.

And seriously wondering why the terror threat level hasn't been raised.
123 2018-11-08 22:37:38 Oh if I knew then what I know now I would be, well, probly enjoying the massive dividends from my Apple, Microsoft and Google stocks. 
Oh ya and the bitcoin, can't forget the bitcoin. 
124 2018-11-08 22:36:28 Mental health issues in many cases are impossible to spot until it’s too late. Banning bump stocks and automatic weapons, is however, relatively simple.

133 2018-11-08 22:33:32 @RobinhoodApp tried to sell a stock today & received an error 'pdt'. Looked up & it says 'pattern day trader'. Im new to stocks & use ur app 2 learn about trading. Whats point if I get locked into a stock?  Its cost me ~25% of my account value!!  Guess I'll find a more legit site
134 2018-11-08 22:33:18 I've called him to the table to prove what he preaches but he declines every time. He tries to instead sell me his course. Penny stocks suck and I advise everyone to stay away from them as there are way safer investment opportunities out there with the same risk/reward ratio.
135 2018-11-08 22:31:20 @NRA any new thoughts on reducing magazine size , bump stocks etc? In light of the newest of over 200 mass shootings this year?
136 2018-11-08 22:26:41 Exhaustion? After yesterday’s records stocks faded today. Dow was up 10, but Nasdaq was down 40 and the S&P off 7. Issues flat, volume about 1 to 2 - perhaps more telling. The 10 year also faded - 3.24% v about 3.17.
137 2018-11-08 22:24:44 Today, we have AR15s with bump stocks that can kill dozens in a blink. But any tyrant will have tanks and warplanes. So the existence of those wrappings in civilian hands makes no sense from any perspective.
138 2018-11-08 22:24:24 $spy Share buybacks are at an all time high. The less shares outstanding the higher the EPS. Stocks are starting to fall on good earnings because of lower projected earnings. If earnings are inflated already because of share buybacks that won’t be there next year, then I say WTF?

No bump stocks.

No silencers

142 2018-11-08 22:22:59 Notice something and discussed with a coworker today, but want to ask, esp the ppl that I see talking about stocks from time to time like @nnboogie @rtrowe @patrioticjam 
Is it legal in Jam for a Broker/Brokerage Company to essentially resell stock. Let me explain what I mean...
143 2018-11-08 22:22:41 bedazzlled clogs CROCS.. Now I've seen it all...  not sold...  But if people are buying..  Brang it. Everyone wear Crocs, make Croc investors money.  FYI..   I don't have anything to do with crocs nor do I own the stocks...  Most shameful stock ever owned, but money talks.

149 2018-11-08 22:20:27 On today's Money Talk, the Fed leaves interest rates on hold but stays on course for a December hike. Chinese exports surged in Oct despite the imposition of tariffs. Chinese stocks slump in afternoon trading and US oil enters a bear market.
150 2018-11-08 22:20:06 Youre on twitter as anonymous troll. You dont really have much of a leg to stand on when it comes to calling people out on their integrity. Besides, you make assumptions that people are buying stocks without doing their due diligence. How condescending are you?

153 2018-11-08 22:19:33 I need one of you nerds to explain stocks to me.
154 2018-11-08 22:19:28 Wrong. They can crack down on illegal guns and mandate and require licensing and waiting period for those obtained legally. They can ban assault rifles and bump stocks, or whatever they are called.  Don't tell me to arm teachers and houses of worship for godssakes.
155 2018-11-08 22:19:09 Someone just pointed out that $NBEV brought up an offering. I didn't see this one coming... they were out of cash in the summer, but I thought the $30 million would be good. Completely blindsided everyone. Doesn't help all pot stocks tanked too. Hope some of you made it out :(

162 2018-11-08 22:10:53 So once again, banning bump stocks were quoted to me as an effective gun control “common sense” measure, yet the person I question cannot or will not answer me as to why and how banning bump stocks will mitigate mass shootings.  Anyone wanna answer for him?
163 2018-11-08 22:10:39 that's where fights go down.

My friends work in Semiconductor said their companies have started the layoffs. Many have cut 50% of Labors. Most Semiconductor's stocks are down 50%-70% from the high. It will be a chain reaction if we don't settle US China Trades soon.

170 2018-11-08 22:04:32 Some basic changes to gun ownership & use that will save lives...
-Ban bump stocks & similar devices. There is no valid use for them.
-Ban high capacity magazines
-Re-instate Obama's legislation regarding gun ownership by those with mental health issues.
-Deeper background checks
171 2018-11-08 22:03:50 US stocks have edged lower as a clutch of weak earnings reports punctured a rally from the previous session, which was spurred by the outcome for midterm elections. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 9 points lower at 5,904. #ausshares #stockmarket

173 2018-11-08 22:03:33 So typically after a mass shooting, everyone runs out and buys guns for fear of a future ban. The stocks  go up, people profit. I haven't looked at at the trend in a min, or is it constantly elevated from the constant shootings?
174 2018-11-08 22:03:15 Apparently Americans love stats about spoons as well. personal opinion on bump stocks, waste of time and think there is no place for them.Fortunately the gunman in Vegas used a bump stock, if he hadn’t he probably would’ve done more damage as he would’ve improved his accuracy.
175 2018-11-08 22:01:59 for sure @smartertrader lost his fat butt today! Lottos not working and stocks tanking

183 2018-11-08 21:59:56 This is why I think 4th gen is coming in late 2019. Most of the remaining big investors will hard exit if results aren't seen by February. They'll probably go back to data mining, cell phones, stocks, etc. By 2020 the landscape will be very different.

186 2018-11-08 21:59:05 They already are well restricted tho. Things like bump stocks and soon 3D printed guns show up and they need new laws. You can't legally buy a full auto weapon. At least where I'm at. If you've been in a mental institution you can't get one for 7 years. Still a 7 day background

214 2018-11-08 21:47:31 We can never stop it all, but I bet we can make a big dent. Start banning the sale, importation of clips over, 9 federally maybe? Ban sale, manufacture, importation and possibly possession of anything that makes them shoot faster than a semi-auto. Mods, bump stocks, etc.
215 2018-11-08 21:46:54 307th mass shooting in the U.S this year. Including 23 school shootings. I thought after Sandyhook where preschool children were slaughtered, things would change in your country. Sadly, it's only getting worse. They can't even stop producing bump stocks. You rock @Marina_Sirtis
216 2018-11-08 21:45:20 Didn't try charters tbh but I think their stocks are like 10-15 default anyways so it's not much better

218 2018-11-08 21:43:50 Canada has gun control laws. No bump stocks, no modifications, no open carry, AR15 only used at shooting range with limited transport rules, background checks and 2 week waiting period. 22% households in Canada own guns ( 95% are long guns, 5% hand guns), mostly for hunting.

Theres no question that you're never ridding the streets of guns, but we can and must do better. 304 mass shootings in 309 days in 2018 dude

228 2018-11-08 21:39:15 I was wondering why we don't just ban large magazines  for guns.  Let people have all the automatic rifles they want, but they only have 6 rounds at a time.  And ban bump stocks.  Along with all the background checks, etc.
229 2018-11-08 21:39:08 Why cant you buy with your tfsa? TD allows american stocks to be held in a canadian tfsa
230 2018-11-08 21:38:15 One (indirect) way to discern between the two could be looking at beta during market crash events. The pure leverage constraint explanation will show up with stocks having an unusually low/negative beta in such events as L/S funds will have to close positions during degrossing

232 2018-11-08 21:37:57 Okay.  You have quoted banning bump stocks as a logical and common sense measure.  What will banning a bump stock accomplish?  How will it affect firing rates, reloads, and accuracy?

234 2018-11-08 21:36:55 And don’t forget the slide stocks. They go hand in hand with the banjos. But you already knew that
235 2018-11-08 21:36:48 @realdonaldtrump Just following up on your promise to ban Bump Stocks. It has been 13 months now since 59 people were massacred in LV. What is taking so long? Or, was that just more bullshit that you spew out but never back up?
236 2018-11-08 21:36:45 I love hearing sports gambling "stats", just people finding numbers that are hugely coincidental. Not too different from how some people value certain stocks  
237 2018-11-08 21:36:32 And what’s your point Dana? You have fought every law regarding guns; closing loopholes, keeping guns out of persons with mental health issues hands, bump stocks, gun show background checks, etc. you’re nothing more than a gun lobbying whore.
238 2018-11-08 21:36:08 You’re already engaging in false dichotomies and straw man arguments. 

Take out the word “prevent”, and pose the question properly: 

“Has the ease of acquiring bump stocks and rapid fire weapons with large clips contributed to more gun deaths?”
239 2018-11-08 21:34:53 Today's numbers were frustrating to a lot of people. I started warning in May that USDA will have to raise its China corn stocks by 100 mmt. They did by more than that - 149 mmt. Bottom line: they finally got that out of the way and we can watch how fast they are falling. #oatt
240 2018-11-08 21:34:30 Mass shooting is defined as having 4 or more casualties. Since the mass shooting at Tree of Life, Squirell Hill, MA. the US has had 11 mass shootings. It is time for the NRA to stop issuing prayers&condolences and to start supporting gun control iniatives. That will boost stocks!
241 2018-11-08 21:34:16 Lol I told you. I’m open to reasoned debate.  I’ve already asked you why you believe bump stocks should be banned.  I’m still waiting for an answer.
242 2018-11-08 21:33:07 These are government stocks. Most of what is left was put into storage in 2015, which was a wet year. Most of that is positioned away from export terminals, but quality is questionable for export market. Thus they want to make ethanol out of it.
243 2018-11-08 21:32:29 $RIO and $MLNX are the only companies that closed up from their closing price last week on my watch list... disappointing day in the market. The FED held off hiking interest rates this month so I would expect stocks to recover tomorrow. #investing #stocks #stockmarket
244 2018-11-08 21:32:08 World corn stocks minus China & U.S. were at 38 days prior to today. Today's USDA report pushes them all the way up to (drumroll please) 39 days. The primary question is, when will China need to come to the market to buy, but there's a lot of demand in the mean time. #oatt
245 2018-11-08 21:32:03 Just dodge everyone with the best up+B move in the game until their stocks run out
246 2018-11-08 21:31:31 Banjo stocks. They’re a big thing in the future
247 2018-11-08 21:31:26 Why did I sell my sbux stocks last month  I knew I shouldve waited till December smfh I’m too impatient
248 2018-11-08 21:31:21 As someone not knowledgeable in stocks or company earnings why do you not want them to suck? After diablo announcement and how WOW is doing I’m not sure things will look great. Black ops 4 will most certainly help boost the earnings though
249 2018-11-08 21:31:18 interestingly enough, SE's stocks haven't dropped anywhere near a warning level after that 15 announcement.

I'm interested to see how that plays out as well tbh lmao
250 2018-11-08 21:30:34 @paulviollis I was just watching @CBSNLive about the California shooting and was wondering if you can explain to me what is a "semi automatic hand gun with an extended stock" that you just described? None of my hand guns have stocks, let alone "extended" ones!

260 2018-11-08 21:25:54 Pretty soon ill be exclusively trading OTC stocks (waiting on new broker). Options/futures are fun, but the hard facts are only OTC has shown me profits this year. And facts are facts

262 2018-11-08 21:25:15 Yeah, that one precisely. My quant skills and patience are not high enough to go with fancier measures. 
Have to admit your correction is valid here as I've also ran idiosyncratic vol as away to wee out "bad" value and momo stocks and it turned out surprisingly robust
263 2018-11-08 21:25:07 On my death bed, I will tell all who gather to see me off
"All my worldly wealth - estate holdings i.e. land property, homes, stocks, bonds, bank securities, jewels, etc., will be gifted to them, if I have any." Sadly, I have none. But, it's the thought that counts. Right?
264 2018-11-08 21:25:01 Bump stocks aren't automatic guns. Along with that bump stocks might make you shoot faster but also much less accurate. I can't think of any other shooting that someone used a bump stock, but this is just another example of a pointless ban. That wouldn't actually change anything.

268 2018-11-08 21:22:14 because it's pointless legislation. how many people even have bump stocks? it's not accurate and anyone who actually shoots regularly can shoot about as fast without one.
it was snake oil and the masses ate it up without question as did Trump
269 2018-11-08 21:21:08 Going to be a hoot watching the Dem Primary as these liberals try to one up each other. “I’ll see your $500/month UBI & raise to $700/month. The evil rich people can pay.” Get long a basket of pot stocks, Dominos, Grubhub, some gaming stocks and Lazyboy. We’re truly F’d

282 2018-11-08 21:16:11 Bump stocks are no good. Remember that school shooter in Texas last year? He had a basic shotgun and slaughtered many. Very high number
283 2018-11-08 21:15:23 Obligatory Eiger interview after $DISN earnings on CNBC - barring major announce would expect stock flat to slightly up $117ish. Bright side = better than listening to desk talking head (Link) on stocks. Good time for hour break
284 2018-11-08 21:15:21 California *already* restricts assault weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, short barreled rifles, etc.   So the only thing after all this would be taking away all guns, including those innocent handguns that were used in this shooting. Not an ar15

287 2018-11-08 21:14:00 I can’t wait for the Democratic House to pass all kinds of common sense gun control legislation (universal background checks, ban bump stocks) and force Mitch McConnell to explain to the American people why the Republican Senate won’t even vote on it.
288 2018-11-08 21:13:35 World stocks ex US generally edge higher: Europe +.2%; US -.3%. With no reason to move higher US stocks gave back a bit of week's gains. Will take a few days to see if market can hold rest of gain and even advance a little. 4Q 2018 should be fine but 2019 may be somewhat rocky.
289 2018-11-08 21:12:55 Have you been under a rock? Tell me you haven’t heard:
1) remove loopholes to background checks
2) stop selling military style weapons designed to kill many people in a short amount of time
3) ban bump stocks
4) address obstacles preventing mentally ill, and ppl with violent past
290 2018-11-08 21:11:24 Stocks stay mostly lower as the Fed stands pat on interest rates - MarketWatch
291 2018-11-08 21:10:56 I have been good at watching my in flight stocks and getting out b4 earnings but last night didn’t review and didn’t create a launch list as I got distracted with family priorities .. lesson learned
292 2018-11-08 21:10:03 Stocks end modestly lower after Wed. post-election surge. Dow +11, +0.04% to 26,191 but all other major indexes lose ground. S&P -0.3%, Nasdaq -0.5%.

299 2018-11-08 21:07:19 The thing that worries me most about Diablo Immortal and the effect on the company’s stocks is that it might just lead the company to the conclusion that Diablo costs money. We’ve seen how hostile they’ve have been to Diablo before.
300 2018-11-08 21:06:48 Things we should've learned about in high school:

-How to graph a parabola 
-Ribosomes and cytoplasm
301 2018-11-08 21:05:41 Yea I guess but then you run into the  consumption of bitcoin and if that's even possible. I guess it could be considered "consumed" if it is spent or transacted. Wiki says intrinsic value of stocks is through fundamentals of its company. Why does bitcoin have to be so exotic?
302 2018-11-08 21:05:32 If government will start with often auctions they will decrease price and will confirm stocks. very soon we will see
303 2018-11-08 21:04:24 any weed stocks you recommend looking at?

305 2018-11-08 21:03:22 You can always expect stocks to go down at the end of the day a large majority of the time because one of a lot of day traders rules is that the have to be 100% out of the market at close.
306 2018-11-08 21:03:18 CBOT Dec wht down A$0.24/t with small drop in futures & slightly lower A$. World stocks up 6.5 mill t but it was all in China. Non Chinese stocks down 900kt. Aust crop down 1 mill t to 17.5 mill t.

313 2018-11-08 21:02:03 @NancyPelosi just in case you are following me, here is my idea for the upcoming legislative session: pass one item bills that make it very easy to describe what we are for and the GOP is against. For example, a bill that just bans bump stocks. Keep it simple.

316 2018-11-08 21:00:13 Gave back 40% on NVDA - What I learnt was to have a Elevated VIX rule to go to cash above 20. And a 3-4x ATR Stop on stocks. Would have only given back 20%. But still either way covered the possibility of more downside while taking profits. Need to get better.
317 2018-11-08 20:59:11 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
318 2018-11-08 20:59:05 Win Jan canola down A$1.36/t & EU rape down A$2.92. US soybn prodn estimates cut but ending stocks up as exports cut. China actively cutting demand for soybns by lowering protein levels in feed mixes. US exports to China down but lifting elsewhere.
319 2018-11-08 20:59:03 Good points Jordan. I probably have a bias to UK although I am looking at individual uk stocks all yielding over 5% on very attractive valuations. Fair point on USD. I am euro denominiated & in my opinion to buy the GBP/Eur at c 0.90 is also a chance of currency gain over time

341 2018-11-08 20:48:19 Some would say fish stocks have recovered in spite of the EUs CFP and not because of it,until someone can answer my previous question it would be difficult to conclude otherwise,forcing hundreds of thousands of tonnes of good fish to be dumped annually impeded stock recovery.

I only said what I said because I believe in free markets without any form of patronage. If I own a business and it's operating within regulations, why should my supplier police how I sell my stocks?
348 2018-11-08 20:44:08 Reminder that Automatic guns aren’t illegal everywhere and can be bought in certain states Reminder that bump stocks have only ever been used in one mass shooting. Reminder that handguns kill 20 times more people than any other gun. Reminder that more people die by knifes a year.
349 2018-11-08 20:43:24 My two points made are firstly the collapse of the fishing industry was  little to do with the EU and second recovery of fish stocks is partially to do with EU regulations

358 2018-11-08 20:40:05 If your shorting these stocks today, you are completely oblivious to the cyclical nature of resource markets and are generally just pushing it after what has already been a giant downturn.

Anyone doing so deserves to lose their money as far as I'm concerned.
359 2018-11-08 20:39:37 The Fed left rates unchanged as expected with clear indication of an already priced in December hike.

362 2018-11-08 20:39:01 @FZucchi can only assume if proceeds from issuance haven't really hit stocks yet, should be like a tsunami wave wiping out shorts when it finally hits...
363 2018-11-08 20:39:00 the Fed basically told Trump to get lost today -- thats what happened      stocks lower  yields higher
364 2018-11-08 20:38:28 The Fed left rates unchanged as expected with clear indication of an already priced in December hike. Stocks have drifted off a little after yesterdays stellar performance and the USD stronger again with EURUSD back below 1.1400 and looking likely to test recent lows at 1.1302.
365 2018-11-08 20:36:21 Universal background checks, end gun show loophole, outlaw bump stocks increase availability of mental health services.  I agree there are existing laws on the books that need to be enforced and there is no one solution that will solve this problem.  Doing nothing won't work.
366 2018-11-08 20:36:15 My buddy who knows nothing about markets told me i need to check out marijuana stocks.. as much as i'd love for them to fill the gap, thats a pretty fat sell signal D:

368 2018-11-08 20:34:32 You are talking beyond basic here. Any decent student I've worked with understands this. That you need the help of SD models to understand the difference between stocks and flows in the energy system only tells me something about you.

370 2018-11-08 20:32:25 @SRuhle I'm a fan, but ur hella wrong.
Less than 7% of the bottom 80% of the US owns any stocks.
Most ardent DT voters r rural/workin class whites who keep voting against their interests bc of cultural grievance & a 40yr old GOP strategy to hijack & pervert religion for politics.

Quick way to ruin self esteem.
Never chase stocks or hoes.
375 2018-11-08 20:30:40 Then pass each piece one page at a time and see where it stops. See who disagrees with passing nothing but bump stocks...no pork...no bans...just one law at a time, leans and mean....then you will know who is stopping. Till then, blame ALL politicians
376 2018-11-08 20:30:39 I saw that chart earlier today and was thinking about it. If demonetization caused Indians' tastes for cash to change, such that they preferred holding less rupee notes in favor of more t-bills, stocks, gold, or US banknotes, then the currency-to-M3 ratio wouldn't capture that.
377 2018-11-08 20:30:24 The Las Vegas shooter killed 58 and injured 422 with the aid of bump stocks. Do you honestly think he could have had the same death and injury count without them?
378 2018-11-08 20:29:18 I know it's too much to ask for, but if they release an option called "competitive mode" or "personal rules" where u can create your own rules like # stocks, time, your stages with hazzards ON or off in spefic ones. that wouldve amazing for us
379 2018-11-08 20:29:04 Amazing how well tobacco stocks have done over this period despite the trend

382 2018-11-08 20:27:54 @business @markets. #USClose : @TheChartress : Tell this #MarkSebastian that companies are NOT buying back stocks because they think their stock id undervalued from QE.  We are in a bubble. Companies are flushed with Cash from #Trump's tax plan, etc.
383 2018-11-08 20:27:21 $KWEB adding to KWEB or names that have delivered earnings as somehow despite being off 30% or more and consensus reflecting downgrades, stocks still go down after results which offers opportunity for the LT investors (and shorting opportunities for the ST investors)
384 2018-11-08 20:27:05 Those shorting U stocks will risk being missed out once the train starts to move in a faster gear. It is going to be EXTREMELY explosive. Take a look of DML' history data, you will know why.

387 2018-11-08 20:25:59 Then why were weed stocks down today, makes no sense
388 2018-11-08 20:24:30 AR-15 is easy to obtain.
Fire selector only real difference between it and M-16.
"Bump stocks" still available.
High capacity clips easy to obtain.
AK-47 is less easy to obtain than before.
AR-15 is "military" enough.
Covering every fine point in precisely 280 characters is hard.
389 2018-11-08 20:24:19 Since the Second Amendment only protects the military, we really don't need to "protect" it. We really need to protect the citizenry. Ban assault weapons, bump stocks, large magazines, ownership of >4 guns. Eliminate concealed weapons and open carry.
390 2018-11-08 20:23:50 He's now getting into illegal immigration, etc... I want to see where he goes. He did "give in" and say he was against bump stocks. Did you see where he's protecting the Vegetarians by killing the deer who eat all the vegetables?

Hell u should see my Risk Analyzer my acct. is about $200 and my watch list is about $500,000.Self taught trader.
394 2018-11-08 20:21:07 @andy_r if you figure it out, please let me know. I thought this was suppose to be cheapest amongst FANG stocks
395 2018-11-08 20:20:54 The heads of all agencies.That participate in the rules& stats. For example the head of the Veterans committee Phil Roe in TN . Has stocks in the drug Suboxone. Other example the state legislature who in my state have again personal financial gain for the rehabs.  Public records
396 2018-11-08 20:20:00 Any day stocks aren't getting killed?  Eurodollars are
397 2018-11-08 20:18:57 Are FANG tech stocks cheap here
398 2018-11-08 20:17:40 when people invest in stocks they buy debts

399 2018-11-08 20:16:48 Cannabis stocks are down! What will this mean ?! Mmm I wonder
400 2018-11-08 20:16:47 and now stocks creeping back to pre FOMC..another late day blast lower in T's and GE?
401 2018-11-08 20:15:26 $EMES Try Thinkerswim, go to option chains, open intrinsic and extrinsic values and compare with current bid and ask. That is an example of option price manipulation. It happens in many stocks and less on etfs.
402 2018-11-08 20:15:21 And AR 15 is no more than a 223 with a kit on it to make it look like a military rifle. It’s a semi-automatic rifle. I agree with banning bump-stocks. The fully automatic weapons are brought in by illegal immigrants!
403 2018-11-08 20:15:02 The biggest mistake we made 2 years ago was selling Disney and Microsoft stocks, beyond tragic
404 2018-11-08 20:14:41 The market always overreacts, so it's usually a good bet to buy when stocks get sold indiscriminately like $mdxg. Stocks as a whole have come down a lot due to irrational fear. If @POTUS kills the economy I will sell and buy conservative blue chips
405 2018-11-08 20:12:49 Sauf qu'on l'a déjà dans nos stocks celui là 
406 2018-11-08 20:12:42 But equally it was the EU restrictions being enforced which recovered the fish stocks
407 2018-11-08 20:12:19 Their wealth is mostly built up in stocks. If they sold it all, the stock price would plummet, having a negative effect on the economy and hurting those who have shares in their companies
408 2018-11-08 20:12:10 Bull crap. The majority of politicians - which are the people who matter - are interested in closing loopholes, limiting magazine sizes, and banning bump stocks. The right cares about abortion, but fuck the ones that make out alive.
409 2018-11-08 20:11:47 While the major indexes will likely back and fill or maybe even undercut the recent lows, the better names have likely made their lows as leading stocks tend to bottom ahead of the general market.
410 2018-11-08 20:10:17 Jared, spreading the DGB word to friends and family. i have invested in stocks and not making total comparison w/ crypto but “market cap” is one of many indicators.  Do you think it  completely irrelevant?   Are there other things to watch 4 or is best not to say?
411 2018-11-08 20:10:15 Stocks are so much easier imo

415 2018-11-08 20:07:26 Depends. They say the economy is doing well when the stock market is doing well, and when unemployment is low. But most people don't trade stocks, and many salaries aren't keeping up w/ inflation and rising cost of health care. Many new jobs offer no benefits or stability.
416 2018-11-08 20:07:22 And based on housing stocks since Jan, a similar scenario is playing out right now.
417 2018-11-08 20:07:16 Most people here in the state's want sensible gun laws.  The NRA refused to take even the basic steps and spends millions to prevent it.  
We can't even ban bump stocks.  The part used to make an ar15 style rifle shoot like an automatic. This was used in the Las Vegas massacre.
418 2018-11-08 20:07:13 Fully briefd? U mean the NRA made add'l contributions 2 urz nd othr republicans' nxt campaigns? Ur a disgrace 2 mankind. If u had any human decency u wld nforce tafer backgrond checks nd get rid of automatic rifles entirely. U wuld ban bump stocks as well. Mueller is coming 4 u.
419 2018-11-08 20:06:56 And you are doing a great job! Every stock on the key list and maxlist has the potential to make a big move. I pick the ones that fits my style and my shedule for the day. I dont fool around with maxlist stocks when the volatility peakes if I cant watch!
420 2018-11-08 20:06:44 stocks look like shit to me, i'm sorry
421 2018-11-08 20:05:53 Good stocks don’t go down 20%+ in one day man. This was a bad call.
422 2018-11-08 20:05:41 Oui ce ne sont que les stocks à la sortie. En théorie il devrait y en avoir d’autres après.
423 2018-11-08 20:05:39 True, but if making it more difficult for that person to get their hands on a semi automatic or fully automatic weapon, or bump stocks or any other military grade weapon saves even 1 life - then it’s COMPLETELY worth it. All while NOT infringing on your 2ndA rights

428 2018-11-08 20:04:04 Will you sell U stocks for short term profits, or you hold them long?
429 2018-11-08 20:03:36 The fact that bump stocks are STILL LEGAL is absolutely sickening.
430 2018-11-08 20:02:06 If I can build a large position in a stock which moves up 100% in a few weeks, I make a huge return. I cannot do that in penny stock or stocks with low volume. The risk is too high that such a crappy stock gapped down large overnight.

432 2018-11-08 20:01:47 It’s made even harder when people believe false information designed to make them against any kind of reasonable mulled ground. Is banning the tools (bump stocks) to circumvent the current law against automatic rifles really a bad idea? Seriously? You’re worried 1/2
433 2018-11-08 20:00:48 so about that promised ban on bump stocks....
434 2018-11-08 20:00:11 Such a weird thing to keep promoting on twitter.....does literally everyone on twitter own stocks in campbells but me? do I own stock and dont even know it? why is this something to brag about?.....so many questions....
435 2018-11-08 20:00:09 Sustainable commercial fishing is a lie. These fools aren’t protecting fish stocks. They’re protecting their jobs.
436 2018-11-08 20:00:08 I never look for the one stock where I can make 500-1000% in a few weeks. I always look for #stocks where I can make 30-100% in a few weeks and repeat it a few times in a year.
437 2018-11-08 19:59:57 Thank you Mr. Allred. As one of your constituents, I ask you to please pass laws to:

1. Fund gun violence research
2. Require universal background checks
3. Close gun-show and straw man loopholes
4. Expand access to mental health services
5. Ban bump stocks & assault weapons

454 2018-11-08 19:51:39 Graduated licensing.
You get a license for a .22 revolver and work your way up.
Your license is not tied to your gun serial no. erho no tracking. To purchase, you must have a license that matches that gun/ammo type. No bump stocks. No trigger twirls. No large cap mags.

493 2018-11-08 19:32:30 These faggots that shoot people need to be made fun of. The media tries to make them out to be scary, but that only makes these sicko more empowered. They WANT to be feared. If we take the fear away and make them laughing stocks I think it'll truly change.
494 2018-11-08 19:32:18 as expected today was the dump day for stocks! =)
495 2018-11-08 19:31:15 With Jeff Sessions being fired I would imagine marijuana stocks are skyrocketing!

509 2018-11-08 19:27:22 I agree that the current AI hype will cause some stocks to take a tumble when it deflates but I must also add that expert system tech is excellent for building systems that give great recommendations on when to buy and sell stocks. I build two of them in the 90's: great results.

514 2018-11-08 19:24:35 @TheJohnSenning I like to hear the show stocks on about people can't control their emotions which I think is the biggest Factor leading to mass shootings. You can compare it with road rage! people can't control their emotions. Only that can eliminate mass shootings
515 2018-11-08 19:24:33 The "governor elect" of Georgia should be set in stocks and pelted with rotten fruit by passing citizens.
516 2018-11-08 19:24:28 Universal background checks wouldn’t require a constitutional amendment, nor would a waiting period, nor a ban on semi-automatic weapons or bump stocks.

Today they're among the biggest losers, $FB -2.4% and $NVDA -3.2%, while Nasdaq is -0.3%.
523 2018-11-08 19:22:07 A mixed bag of stocks. Often many will rise with the tide (market) but not all will continue higher and why it's important to be selective.

532 2018-11-08 19:18:07 To me, “tied” means a pub owned by a brewery that only stocks that brewery’s beers. Not all breweries that own multiple pubs tie them, and not all breweries that own one pub don’t tie it.
533 2018-11-08 19:17:21 All the stock picking is done when you can’t buy stocks. Bullish.
534 2018-11-08 19:16:52 There is nothing wrong with sensible gun control. It does not mean taking your guns away. Handguns, rifles and shotguns have uses in society. Assault weapons and accessories like bump stocks and extended magazines do not. What we are doing now is not working. You could be next.

536 2018-11-08 19:15:28 I thought this only made changes to section 5 firearms and bump stocks, is that something that affects you?
537 2018-11-08 19:14:31 Of course I blame the shooter. I also mourn for the dead. I will also support measures that keep weapons from those that shouldn’t have them, and to restrict items like extended mags and bump stocks. That’s my perogative.

540 2018-11-08 19:13:32 Starting to regret not buying one when I saw them for sale in Supervalu last week on limited stocks for €50! Cheapest I’ve seen it. I might wait until Monday or Tuesday next week, but I think it’s safe to assume it isn’t showing up at this point. Really disappointing!
541 2018-11-08 19:13:31 Best equipped in that it had more medium and heavy artillery, stocks of grenades and  better optics to industry. But British personal kit (and tactical doctrine) was better in 1914.
542 2018-11-08 19:12:49 I wish I knew about October “pullback” but since I didn’t I’ve been holding all my stocks since the first week of October. Another lesson added to my learning to trade experience.

3) To listen to Dems, "Evil Republicans" are the only ones who own & use guns.

549 2018-11-08 19:08:33 I’m an Arizonan, a 2A advocate and a shooter. Nobody wants to confiscate any guns from law abiding citizens. Period. It’s about banning future sales of semi-auto rifles and bump stocks and preventing sales to people with domestic abuse or violent threat histories.

554 2018-11-08 19:06:26 Thanks man, did some reading up earlier. Apparently 'bump stocks' can simulate full auto fire, so I guess they're used pretty often. Found a few reports from recently about banning them, making them out to be pretty popular.

568 2018-11-08 19:02:00 It’s mind boggling that the second amendment was written in 1791. Do we really think the people who initially wrote this amendment would comprehend the possessions of semi-automatic rifles, bump stocks, extended magazines? Lol it’s laughable for people to not want reform

571 2018-11-08 19:00:58 meiner meinung: stocks + dividende = „bruchteiliger inhaber der firma“; coins + masternode = „bruchteiliger teilnehmer des netzwerks“.. aber mal schaun in welche richtung des gehen wird.

582 2018-11-08 18:52:56 In my understanding the central banks are busy buying stocks, metals etc as mentioned above, so as fiat slides in value to whatever minimized value, these $ brokers do not go away, their influence just morphs. Accurate?

593 2018-11-08 18:46:07 This is your reminder that bump stocks are still legal in this country and the administration has no intentions of outlawing them or passing even the most sensible gun reforms (like outlawing bump stocks).
594 2018-11-08 18:46:04 1st thing you can do with our majority is full out Gun Control. No compromise. AR-15, automatics, High capacity mags, bump stocks, mental issues, no wait periods and everything else including kitchen sink needs to be done to get this done. I don’t want this to happen to my kids!

597 2018-11-08 18:45:02 I know I was talking about bump stocks. Inaccurate or not it still puts a weapon very close to automatic. And semi-automatics are really nearly as bad and are used frequently which was my main point
598 2018-11-08 18:43:59 unless we can get some resolution in trade, these Chinese names simply can't get up off the ground.
My views on expectations of action in the Chinese stocks has been so off even my shadow is telling me to shut up.
Unfortunately, I see nothing to like in the short term
599 2018-11-08 18:43:58 $spx #stocks not withstanding indictment of DJT jr and other risks, stocks are short and long term buy. This selloff ahead of FEd announcement is predictable but Fed won’t spook market with its release and we should rally after the announcement.
600 2018-11-08 18:43:24 And I agree that guns are an inalienable right, but I think that there needs to be a discussion on TYPES of guns.  For example, it's illegal to own fully automatic weapons isn't it?  Then why are we okay with loopholes like bump stocks?
601 2018-11-08 18:43:22 Parkland shooter 19yo, legally purchased weapons, Pit. Shooter legally bought his weapons had mental health issues, LV Shooter had 12 bump stocks on that hotel room, which themselves are not illegal..  just a few examples of what might have been prevented.
602 2018-11-08 18:42:31 Ur argument is that bitcoin's least amount of cyclical volatility is more volatile than the PEAK of the most volatile stocks in the stock market???
603 2018-11-08 18:41:50 In February of 2018,  Trump explicitly called for raising the age limit,  universal background checks,  and banning bump stocks,  but it was abandoned and tucked away.   That’s just a few that are NOT in place but could have deterred Vegas,  parkland, Texas....
604 2018-11-08 18:41:42 We still have journalists! We know what happened. Why don't you try working on mental health, better background checks, waiting periods, ban bump stocks and large clips, and better veterans care to start. Last night's shooter was a vet. See a pattern of white men & mass killing?
605 2018-11-08 18:41:27 I guess the Fed ( @federalreserve ) is not going to surprise anyone tonight... the magic is already gone and I think Powell won’t bring it back.

Let’s see if I am wrong in this one for the good of the US economy. The inevitable will end up happening.

607 2018-11-08 18:40:50 So automatic weapons are already illegal. The required modifications are already illegal, aside from bump stocks which I’ve not used, but from my understanding do make quick shooting easier so I’ll give you that. What about semi-auto pistols?

616 2018-11-08 18:36:35 Seeing reports that the shooter used extended mags in his gun. Remind me of why these things are legal again? They make mass killing easier & make it harder for 1st responders. Like 'bump stocks', we need to have a serious convo about 'extendos'. #CaliforniaShooting

647 2018-11-08 18:24:12 Interesting Stock Market:  Celebrated Democrat House win.  GOP can't move forward with the cuts GOP planned for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security so that's good for healthcare stocks.  But it leaves us with a $1 TRILLION/year deficit with no solution in sight.

664 2018-11-08 18:18:29 Everything went down in oct. Not just uranium stocks. And they've pretty much all rebounded to the highs in 1 week or so. Meanwhile uranium price went higher in its vacuum.
665 2018-11-08 18:18:24 Losing money trading (holding) losing stocks? By the time many get the questions they think need answered, a stock can be down considerably more than when they first started the investigation. Sell first, ask questions later. You can always re enter later.

674 2018-11-08 18:13:35 The Las Vegas shooter killed 58 and injured 422 with the aid of bump stocks. Do you honestly think he could have had the same death and injury count without them?
675 2018-11-08 18:13:24 Essentially, what I'm saying is the existence of bump stocks is ultimately irrelevant when you could easily make one or just use your finger.

681 2018-11-08 18:09:16 So for example you dont think that banning bump stocks and semi-automatic weapons, strengthening background checks, and raising the age limits to purchase weapons might be a good place to start? Obviously there's no cure all.  But we can do things to make a difference IMO.
682 2018-11-08 18:09:03 Hey @dnc majority congress elect, this country needs gun safety legislation now, so find your spine by banning bump stocks, high capacity clips, and assault rifles, closing gun show loopholes, & expanding mandatory background checks that include domestic abuse and PTSD

686 2018-11-08 18:08:43 Does the china corn stocks revision represent net new supply to the market or existing supply that didn't hit the books before?
687 2018-11-08 18:07:39 Global commodity stocks: Nice to see people looking at ES without or with discounted China stocks. But lower global ES will not always equate to firmer markets. And global Econ stats like PMIs suggest economies are not great. #grains #Econ

You now hold the same $ value of each and you expect them both to rise at the same rate over the next 12 months. You need cash now for a big purchase, however. Which do you sell?

715 2018-11-08 17:57:27 I noticed it when I went digging around for marijuana stocks after double positives of legalization in MI and news Jeff Sessuons resigned. I put a little below market buy order in on a penny stock MCOA and a common stock TLRY
716 2018-11-08 17:56:49 S&P 500 fell 10% at its October lows. FAMG stocks that over-populate passive funds were down 12% at lows. Investors should heed the message that momentum trading works both ways and is amplified by passivity. Most glaring example: Apple in over 200 passive products.
717 2018-11-08 17:55:58 As the name suggested, Motley Fool was whimsical and a breath of fresh air when it first started out. As time went by it transformed into a company that sends out clickbait messages touting stocks that will skyrocket, make millions etc.

726 2018-11-08 17:52:41 Sensible gun reform is needed! I’m not advocating repealing the 2nd amendment. A waiting period for all gun purchases, universal background checks to prevent violent people from having weapons, banning military style weapons, banning bump stocks, banning people on no fly list.

867 2018-11-08 17:09:30 the ones that tanked from q3 earnings were on self-inflicted guide downs for q4 and 2019 on lower rev and earnings projections on lower growth ahead but the buyers are calling BS, and these stocks are nearly at the same levels of pre-selling.

914 2018-11-08 16:59:56 The NRA is no friend of gun owners.

917 2018-11-08 16:59:06 Absolutely right in most cases. Hope is not strategy. If I lose 10% I’m out. My other stocks and consistency of using dividend investments which cover any small loss make a loss painless. The biggest fault (I don’t do) is letting it drop too far to recover. Why the drop?

951 2018-11-08 16:47:46 It took two sentences to ban acosta. Not even a law. Nice try though. Maybe you should try to ask NJ why nobody turned in their bump stocks after the ban passed. Or why cocaine is everywhere still. Or why a vet with PTSD that wasn't allowed to have a gun did have one.

958 2018-11-08 16:45:49 A ban on assault rifles & bump stocks should be obvious at this point. Besides that though - better mental health services/checks, fed cooperation, more restrictions on who can purchase (min 21 & no assault convictions, imo), and longer waiting periods should all be standard.

969 2018-11-08 16:43:32 yes if you cherry pick the tech low (2003) to today, and assume they went all-in on tech stocks. What about QQQ from 2000 to today?

970 2018-11-08 16:43:17 Well, lets look at the proposal to ban bump stocks. One year on from Las Vegas and still no law has been passed. Why is it such a hard thing to simply ban? If they really wanted them banned it would have been done a long time ago

987 2018-11-08 16:36:07 You haven’t had a proliferation of automatic weapons in public hands since the existence of the nation.  And I’m guessing your ancestors couldn’t buy bump stocks off the Internet.

996 2018-11-08 16:34:31 I don’t trust YOUR memory of what you see on TV either. I trust data & financial sources including government data.

1000 2018-11-08 16:33:26 Made mistake on the 2 overnights in AAPL and BABA.  Sold the gap down at open like the rule calls for. As I analyze the trade, I did pick right stocks for the play, but when the osc is plus 50 it cancels the overnight play as a trade for the gap open.

1034 2018-11-08 16:22:08 Very rightly said. Growth is prime for an expensive stock..as soon as growth dies, valuation contracts.

 Portfolio of expensive stocks will definitely be not my cup of tea. But don't mind holding one or two.

That's why it's said, markets are an art not science

1050 2018-11-08 16:18:01 I think this is may be a misconception. “Simple” strategies may be based on profoundly flawed assumptions (ie CAPM or overconcentrarion in stocks or domestic markets, etc) that may prove harmful.

But yeah, bump stocks are nothing more than range toys, but unless they’re banned explicitly by name, I won’t support the legislation. It’s always been written to leave it open to expanding the ban.

1088 2018-11-08 16:05:46 I’d say this tactic has continued into the presidency ... “During the 1980s, Donald Trump became notorious for leaking word that he was taking positions in stocks, hinting of a possible takeover, and then either selling on the run-up or trying to extract lucrative concessions...”

1098 2018-11-08 16:00:19 Apart from banning semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks. That would've prevented it. Not selling weapons to people with a history of mental illness? That would have prevented a few more shootings.
1099 2018-11-08 15:58:32 With some exceptions, expensive stocks which got even more expensive (due to impressive past CAGR) go through time corrections.

1100 2018-11-08 15:58:15 There are a lot of people wondering why energy stocks are trading like oil is at $40. Well, I think they are a leading indicator of oil prices. Permian production is exploding, OPEC+ is flooding the market, and demand growth is looking soft. Supply > Demand. #oott

1109 2018-11-08 15:52:45 And as for the stock market, it's great for the relatively small percentage who own stocks. My husband is an economist & has many concerns about it, and trade policies, etc. Trump is clueless & his people are afraid of being fired &/or publicly shamed. (See: Sessions, Jeff)
1110 2018-11-08 15:52:27 I believe the big move we had in health care plans stocks like $UNH $ANTM $HUM e.t.c was a bull trap. They got a bid due to split congress in the midterms. That was the outcome Wall street expected. I believe yesterdays move was the top in these stocks...
1111 2018-11-08 15:51:58 Confession time: I honestly just misread the “6” as an “8”. Having 3 stocks again in smash would be dope af, idc how much time it takes.
1112 2018-11-08 15:51:28 @marketbaby007 Don’t fool urself, the next move in GE stocks will be unstoppable, people like u trading for 1-2% up down will be checked out of the game for ever. Analyse word by word spoken by Ravi Jhunjhunwala in the last concall.

1114 2018-11-08 15:51:18 Wasn’t enough fear going into Nov, and a lot of stocks appear artificially inflated, but didn’t $SPX print a higher high yesterday?

1116 2018-11-08 15:50:37 Increased background checks. Increased spending on both diagnosing and treating mental health disorders. Ban bump stocks. Deal with root cause issues like domestic violence, etc that lead to many of these tragedies. Start there. See what works and what doesn’t. Adjust as you go
1117 2018-11-08 15:49:55 Canabis stocks are declining after yesterday's gains. This is so similar to the balloon of the crypto-currencies: big gains for a year and then the air is let out of the balloon. I always look at "ease of entry" of a new firm. Oversupply will kill this bubble.

1126 2018-11-08 15:47:09 With this massive stocks rally.  Fed has all the ammo they need to be full Hawkish.  Not to any threats to Powell as less intimidating now that he lost the House
1127 2018-11-08 15:46:55 Provided you’re a law abiding citizen and pass a proper background check (or qualify for an exemption via LTC) I see no reason you shouldn’t be able to get one. 

I think bump stocks are dumb but have defended them b/c of the vague wording of legislation regarding their banning.

1232 2018-11-08 15:09:46 I did this everytime. But my eyes on the exp date. Didnt find “old stocks” before
1233 2018-11-08 15:09:41 If I were to invest the money I spend on going out in a year in stocks, I’d be a millionaire I’m sure
1234 2018-11-08 15:09:39 The fact that I missed out on making $700 on my stocks because I sold early   wow
1235 2018-11-08 15:09:33 Exactly, remember. Its takes 4 months for crops to grow from start to finish. Then you have to dry out and trim. Yield can vary from strain to strain and one bad day (lights quit, room temp drops etc) can affect yield. MMJ stocks are long term goals
1236 2018-11-08 15:09:25 @TheRealWiseOne well they went after bump stocks before. They gonna go after extended clips now. Watch. When will they realize it’s not the guns!!?
1237 2018-11-08 15:09:24 4 months of selling and still not done going down.  Worst of the FAANG stocks
1238 2018-11-08 15:08:28 Thanks for Keeping your promise last year and BANNING BUMP  STOCKS ( NOT )

1246 2018-11-08 15:05:37 Whole heartedly agree with the background checks. Automatic weapon = 10(?) years in prison. “Assault rifle” is a made up term from call of duty and the news. Bump stocks seem like illegal modification to auto to me so sure. A regulation in a free market economy?

1278 2018-11-08 14:55:47 But they can buy bump stocks which was used in the Las Vegas shooting which increases the rate of fire. Plus you can get a level 3 license which enables you to buy explosives and fully automatics. (Although this is very rare and no doubt really hard to obtain)
1279 2018-11-08 14:55:36 More thorough background checks and mandatory waiting periods for buyers, assault and automatic weapons ban, elimination of bump stocks, regulating gun manufacturers to limit production. There are reasons that mass shootings happen on a regular basis here and never elsewhere.

1290 2018-11-08 14:50:58 Pleasant change to see the FTSE 100 outperforming global indices today. People beginning to realise how undervalued Blighty stocks are. Long may it continue! UK benchmark +1% Dow in negative territory and Dax barely moved from yesterday’s close.
1291 2018-11-08 14:50:38 No truth to that. It's the opposite. That theory has no backing in the real world. Stocks do better during the winter. It's simple math.

IMO you should never be bullish unless it's time to entry wise which was not the case with NVDA and ROKU.  Next imminent move matters more than 3-5yrs
1296 2018-11-08 14:48:48 We're willing to send our military to deter unarmed individuals from entering into our country, but we still haven't even seen a bill to ban bump stocks.
1297 2018-11-08 14:48:33 The pot stocks were a good trade yesterday but as i commented the chart setups were very poor which made it much tougher.

1331 2018-11-08 14:40:14 Bump stocks are a gimmick. Go ahead and ban them, you cannot aim accurately with them at all. Also, you can effectively make a bump stock using a belt loop on your jeans.
1332 2018-11-08 14:40:01 It’s a good idea in a rappers case because if the money is gone tomorrow because a contract died or a lawsuit pops up, or other legal matters, at least you don’t have a car payment. Most average joes with enough money to buy an average Lexus cash know about stocks lol

1340 2018-11-08 14:37:48 Thanks for everything you haven't done too.  Keep up with doing nothing about gun violence.  Not banning bump stocks is an epic accomplishment for you.  The NRA must be very proud.

1342 2018-11-08 14:36:44 Stocks take breather and open down slightly after yesterday's big gains.  Focus is on the Fed as it announces it's latest decision today.  Expectation is no rate change today after 3 hikes this year.

1345 2018-11-08 14:36:27 How is this related to bump stocks?

1397 2018-11-08 14:26:28 Correct. Which is why bump stocks should be illegal, which legislation is coming around to.
1398 2018-11-08 14:26:22 Expand background checks to include mental health screenings, harsher penalties for those producing illegal bump stocks, streamline gun laws across the states, stricter measures to purchase anything higher than a pistol.

Common sense.  What we have isn't working.

This has got to stop.
1402 2018-11-08 14:25:23 Many stocks are pushing higher from downtrends and probably forming left sides of a base. Most likely, trading ranges will continue to be wide - time is required for volatility to subside and for the right side of a base to form.

1481 2018-11-08 13:57:18 There's been a clear shift in the market environment. Shorting stocks which was easy in October has now become very difficult. And stocks with good news are flying higher now! Just my 2 cents!

1524 2018-11-08 13:42:31 The 94 assault weapons ban really didn’t do that much. It was mainly focused on a few select weapons and stuff like large capacity mags, folding stocks, pistol grips. And it grandfathered all the existing guns prior to it passing

1532 2018-11-08 13:40:00 thanks for the advice however, fundamentals don't matter to small cap stocks when naked shorting is allowed to go on unchallenged, or policed by regulatory authorities.  If they did matter, this stock would be a lot higher.

1587 2018-11-08 13:12:19 What does this statistic of post mid-term performance really tell you? Stocks go up most of the time anyway, this can be just a result of data mining.

1589 2018-11-08 13:11:40 Sorry, I can't give short-term targets because I analyze stocks with long-term view in my mind
1590 2018-11-08 13:11:08 So what you are saying is bump stocks are unnecessary.  Why would it be so hard to ban them then? Why do people buy them? Your reasoning is pretty dumb. There’s a reason they are used that can’t be duplicated by how you hold the gun.
1591 2018-11-08 13:10:12 Hey Joe, thanks for the tip on ETFMG. I don't have the time to analyze all the cannabis stocks.  With growth potential, along with 2+Yield This ETF looks pretty good.
1592 2018-11-08 13:10:09 NRA and bump stocks had nothing to do with this. Good reach though try again.

-Extensive background checks in place
Do you still think we need more gun laws? Or maybe there’s a culture problem

1713 2018-11-08 12:09:34 Hey @SMTOWNGLOBAL yall should pray for your stocks lmao. I will not say good luck. If it goes down, thats what you deserve
1714 2018-11-08 12:09:05 $AMRN have not done any secondary offering yet. It's not pump and dump if there is no dump! If a scam, $AMRN should have already sold stocks at inflated price to unbeknownst investors.
1715 2018-11-08 12:07:56 Je trouve ça exécrable qu'ils n'aient pas prévenu lors de la précommande pour les stocks, du moins plus tôt, là ils ne font que diriger vers la version simple chez eux une fois que c'est mort le lendemain de la sortie...
1716 2018-11-08 12:05:46 It IS a parasitic relationship where the wealthy get more and more because they hold the wealth and use it strategically to get more and more. 

The wealthy people who set this up are devious parasites. The people who made up credit cards and penny stocks and all those games.

1730 2018-11-08 11:57:44 We'll have to see when the game is out, but 3 stocks IMO. The problem would be the timer.I believe that @KeitaroTime mentionned earlier that 6 minutes was too short, and some matches of the demo had to end with sudden death. A solid 3 stocks, and 7-8  minutes would be interesting
1731 2018-11-08 11:57:25 Distillate stocks made a good bounce in August but has since come off again so the API probably bounced up again from September
1732 2018-11-08 11:57:19 It can also be argued that one can succeed with a single stock idea , y even have more than one or two . Right ?
Anyway I do not believe in concept of stock picks for a particular festival. It can at best be about stocks that you like at that point of time .

1737 2018-11-08 11:54:14 Most shooters would be above the age you probably advocate for, and bump stocks were not used here. And Americans are innovative. If we ban bump stocks, which wouldn't hurt my feelings, someone will come up with something else similar to it

1748 2018-11-08 11:49:29 Nope I didn’t mean we will have to wait 14 years. I just explained how long it took for Nasdaq. Crypto is 7X faster in my opinion. Weekly chart of commodities and stocks is replicated in daily charts for many crypto. So let’s see how this one goes

1752 2018-11-08 11:46:45 For starters, he could raise the minimum age to buy a gun and could ban bump stocks like he said he would do.  He runs a campaign on "promises made, promises kept" but hasn't done this one.  Why not?

Maybe he is afraid of the @NRA
1753 2018-11-08 11:46:20 The guy I spoke to said the intention was to keep stocks high for the flat glass and they are making batches once or twice a month. They had several stacks of glass with names on, so orders must be coming in. Hopefully the prices won’t rise for another 15 years!

1788 2018-11-08 11:16:21 A couple thoughts on this:
1. Not sure why something being consensus means it doesn't have market implications. Few elections, especially close ones, are ever 100% priced in, and there was a big move in stocks yesterday.
1789 2018-11-08 11:16:01 Sure! What do you struggle most with right now?
- debt?
- where to put your money (stocks, bonds, 401K, all that)
- habits that the rich have that make them so rich

Do you have a base of knowledge, or are you looking for readable overview to get you started on everything?

** U.S. Stocks futures point to a slightly lower open on the heels of the massive 500+ points rally on Weds.

** Overnight traded mostly lower on Asia & European markets.

** Americans prepare with uncertainty what Trump will do next (on anything)... LOL
1795 2018-11-08 11:10:49 At least follow. The Obama Administration legalized bump stocks.

1798 2018-11-08 11:10:02 more people, but compared to the 17,000 that domestic Americans kill....is shockingly small? I mean if you act to “save lives” then you go to save lives. Not say, “this is intimidating.” It’s a deadly weapon. I agree with a 20rd restriction, ban on detachable stocks, 22+, backgro
1799 2018-11-08 11:09:05 When you are rich you can do just about anything. The banks crashed our entire economy. What happened to those guys? They all gave themselves raises. Too big to fail. When you steal a guy's big screen you go to jail. When you steal their retirement and stocks you get a bonus.

1815 2018-11-08 10:53:52 Ticker Symbols

A ticker symbol is a 3, 4 or 5 letter abbreviation that easily identifies every public company.

Stocks traded on the NYSE have symbols with up to 3 letters, like MA (Mastercard).

Stocks traded on the NASDAQ have symbols with 4 letters, like MSFT (Microsoft).

1828 2018-11-08 10:31:07 It could have went to 25% and had the same effect. But put more cash in tax payers hands and it would have had alot more of an impact. You give a person a extra $5K a year and they will spend it. Give corporations the equivalent and they hoard it. Most buy back their stocks.

1841 2018-11-08 10:22:47 So, with Monzo, I find myself not buying things in the moment that I would have bought without thinking. And changing what categories I spend my money on from month to month. All this happens simply through providing me better feedback about the stocks in my account.
1842 2018-11-08 10:22:19 PSA: Sa mga naghahanap ng lipstick ni Maine may stocks pa ang Okada Manila, Mac Stall.

Thank you @thejrbc

1843 2018-11-08 10:22:02 No wonder Trump got rid of him! Trump must have a lot of Marijuana stocks.
1844 2018-11-08 10:21:20 Of course, you can do all this yourself and manually. But it's a lot of effort (I've done it) and this means unless you're super organised you stop doing it (I've done this too). Monzo just makes those stocks and feedback loops so easy you can't avoid using them to think.
1845 2018-11-08 10:20:33 Hope kexols buy the majority of sm's stocks until they're the controlling body hahaha
1846 2018-11-08 10:20:26 So now I'm getting feedback loops about these stocks too. How much I'm spending each month on these things. Which month to month alters my behaviour - eat out less, bike more etc - in subtle ways.
1847 2018-11-08 10:19:38 But there's another feedback loop going on as well. Every time I make a payment I get a notification instantly saying how much I spent. These payments are auto-categorised (eating out, travel etc) which creates new stocks - how much I've spent on eating out, travel etc.
1848 2018-11-08 10:18:24 So the Potstockalypse is over? Would have been better if they reported on these stocks being a buy last week. This makes me uneasy.
1849 2018-11-08 10:16:47 $AMZN Yesterdays rally was Mid Term Elections related. Split House is what the market expected.  Stocks usually rally after major Elections
1850 2018-11-08 10:14:22 Anyway. What emerges from this modelling is that one of the design interventions in any system is to change the way the actors in the system get feedback about the level of the stocks. What they get. When they get it. How delayed it is etc.
1851 2018-11-08 10:14:14 Good thing no bump stocks were used here
1852 2018-11-08 10:13:36 China stocks lower at close of trade; Shanghai Composite down 0.22%
1853 2018-11-08 10:13:36 Finally giving up and going to bed with too little known about #VenturaCounty #Borderline latest mass shooting.
But another reminder that Trump on Oct 1, anniversary of Las Vegas massacre said bump stocks would be banned "in a couple weeks."
1854 2018-11-08 10:10:54 Japan stocks higher at close of trade; #Nikkei 225 up 1.83%
1855 2018-11-08 10:10:26 If you ask me, the GSE's MTNGH and GOIL are winning stocks for 2019.
1856 2018-11-08 10:07:55 5. Female unemployment down because more US women have 2 jobs.
6. US energy independence has slowed under Trump.
7. Stocks up because Trump gave top 1% 1.5 trillion $ tax cut. US 1.5 trillion $ more in debt. GOP congress tried to cut Medicaid, Medicare, & SSecurity to pay 4 it.
1857 2018-11-08 10:05:59 Yes although I am far from an expert in this. There's a thing called systems thinking. Stocks, flows, negative and positive feedback loops. Donatella Meadows' book Thinking In Systems is a highly readable introduction.
1858 2018-11-08 10:04:46 World stocks notch up longest winning streak of year ahead of Fed meeting
1859 2018-11-08 10:03:40 Almost forgot I am a licensed financial advisor for Mutual Funds and stocks since 2012. 
If you need financial tips try me...or not. Hehehehe. But invest while you are young. It pays off. 
1860 2018-11-08 10:01:22 Yes and NB did indicate big news in Q4 in an interview on pro active only a few months ago. Hoping that a few stocks jump abit in SP so I can add more here!
1861 2018-11-08 10:00:57 #OEX hope you do well mate.

2 stocks that STANDOUT from your list are:

1. #OEX = Cambay = 

2. #N4P = Astraze = 
#multiples 
1862 2018-11-08 09:56:13 I really need to be more educated with stocks 
1863 2018-11-08 09:53:37 @timothysykes although I am obviously in the challenge for day trading I have tried some long term positions too on some weed stocks. $EMHTF in $2.80 current price $3.88. $KSHB in $5.40 current price $6.60. Hoping this whole cannabis  legalisation helps the stocks increase more.
1864 2018-11-08 09:53:35 Yea i just forgot about that thanks for pointing it out! But even the stocks drop sm still have more backup to cover up the mess 
1865 2018-11-08 09:52:10 I am recommending the following cannabis stocks: Aurora Cannabis (ACB) at 10.56 CAD, Canopy Growth Corporation (WEED) at 60.23 CAD and Tilray (TLRY) at $138.20
1866 2018-11-08 09:51:56 I don't think so, bc each time a member has a scandal their stocks drop so they wouldn't do that to themselves
1867 2018-11-08 09:51:51 I love my president, my stocks tripled since he took office. Maybe you should invest in stocks instead of  doing those stupid reality shows! Oh yeah, maybe you don't have a job?
1868 2018-11-08 09:51:16 Stocks starting to drift lower and higher US yields may be the reason..
1869 2018-11-08 09:50:43 @Kapitall Keeping it real with  $COHO stocks
1870 2018-11-08 09:48:14 I use moving averages and compare the price to them and MAs to each other to determine points of reversals in trends.

I use Spider Iris EOD to shortlist stocks using MAs and then go through hundreds of charts to find price patterns which can give good returns with minimum risk.
1871 2018-11-08 09:47:25 Seeing same measuring breadth in tech sectors (using stocks above 10D).
1872 2018-11-08 09:46:20 No, Hanteo keeps track of individual album sales from certain stores and websites, whereas Gaon includes those sales as well as store sales (e.g. stocks and possible reorders). So, long story short, they've sold 150K+ albums up until the 31st of October!
1873 2018-11-08 09:45:53 Les stocks à 250€ sont partis.
Les nouveaux stocks seront à 300€ donc 200€ après la réduction.
1874 2018-11-08 09:44:10 Sir..i observed that u r using Heikin AShi chart mostly for those stocks which are in F&O..m i correct? if yes then pls enlighten us with little knowledge
1875 2018-11-08 09:43:59 I fully expected the printing, it's just that I didn't expect Gold to do so poorly during it. I always thought that stocks, bonds and real estate would rise nominally (b/c of the printing) but fall in Gold terms (i.e. Gold rising faster). How wrong I was.
1876 2018-11-08 09:43:53 It takes something like Parkland or Las Vegas to get a strong reaction now. Because my entire adult life has been punctuated by notorious mass shootings, starting with Columbine, and they just go on, and gun stocks go up each time and nothing ever happens at a national level.
1877 2018-11-08 09:43:20 On le trouvait souvent a 250e ces derniers temps.

1878 2018-11-08 09:42:13 As a reminder, we have a base from a H&S on weekly chart @ 11712/11860, Target 10500... Forget those FAANG, there´s thousands of stocks and hundreds of indexes to trade ;)

1885 2018-11-08 09:38:42 And with your mental stop of $0.3, you know this is around your ballpark.. I know you've held stocks for more than 5hrs.. Anyhu, your gap strategies are my bread & butter, all thanks to your effort of teaching others. Your YT channel has helped me tremendously! ;)
1886 2018-11-08 09:38:35 Fascinating. Insufficient as the plans and stocks were, It's outrageous that the government just closed it all down without consulting or informing the public.
1887 2018-11-08 09:37:05 Ah on essaie de liquider ses stocks  ?

1890 2018-11-08 09:35:31 Dealers expecting a quiet session into the Fed meeting tonight.. Unless of course stocks start to move strongly.. Dealers also watching US bonds closely as yields rise..
1891 2018-11-08 09:35:20 US yields remain elevated and may be weighing on stocks to some degree, especially US futures.. Quiet though..
1892 2018-11-08 09:34:57 The USD not reacting to higher US yields..Also stocks have been hit recently by higher yields but not yesterday. US Bond markets seem to suggest that Trump will continue spending.
1893 2018-11-08 09:34:36 With all the nuances of our gun laws and the fact they need to be changed state by state in some cases that's not high on the list compared to raising purchasing ages, banning bump stocks and assault/military style weaponry, and creating universal background checks 
1894 2018-11-08 09:34:34 I use moving averages and compare the price to them and MAs to each other to determine points of reversals in trends.

1900 2018-11-08 09:27:37 I've been talking with a colleague of mine. He made a fortune on stocks. I asked him about #bitcoin. He said "I don't see why people will use it". I explained him about security, efficiency, functionality etc. But he was like "all that doesn't matter". Blind people.
1901 2018-11-08 09:26:15 When do you think it'll be patented?  Are you still renovating a float spa?  Can we get official updates on these things? Your stocks share price has tanked big time lately!!
1902 2018-11-08 09:26:14 Monsieur Doze. Il faut prendre en compte le fait que les distributeurs font des stocks quand le pétrole est au plus bas et travaillent à flux tendu quand le pétrole est au plus haut. Donc ces 10 jours correspondent à 10 jours de pétrole acheté au plus bas et vendu au plus haut
1903 2018-11-08 09:25:39 Markets could be in for a bull run if US Fed softens stance on rate hikes. US dollar will soften & US multinationals benefit. If we get a positive G20 China/US pow wow on Trade wars the hand brake could really come off. Fingies & Toes crossed. #asx #auzbiz #stocks

1906 2018-11-08 09:24:02 Lol the case in which we are so worried about American election glitches when we have a fresh elephant that got killed in day light and nobody talks about it anymore. Let's sort our home first. Americans will tell u stocks are booming!

1908 2018-11-08 09:23:06 Also interested how that's calculated? Return over the stocks whole life to date? Could have gone from 5 to 500 and back to 5 in a decade or even just couple of years! Wonder what the stat would be if you sold all at say 30% from all time high or other simple trend following rule

1910 2018-11-08 09:22:19 There are no protests in Australia for Mueller, they don’t care about US politics, unless they are politicians and journalists whose job depends on it. Stocks are rising, due to gridlock.

Tittar man på vad de vill anställda verkar det behövas fler säljare i US då det växer så det knakar

1919 2018-11-08 09:09:42 According to Brugler Report, USDA is expected to trim the world wheat ending stocks estimate by 0.73 MMT to 259.46 MMT on Thursday. A smaller Australian crop is projected, was well as tighter stocks in other major producers.

1921 2018-11-08 09:06:56 According to Brugler Report, avrg trade estimate heading into Thursday’s monthly USDA reports calls for US soy end stocks to be up 21 mbu to 906 mbu. Production to be lower, but USDA could also trim exports due to poor performance in first two months of MY.
1922 2018-11-08 09:06:35 I’m saying the whole system is letting Americans down...this system can’t effectively deal with bump stocks or the NRA...this system can’t effectively regulate Facebook or Google to protect Rep or Dem privacy...this system can’t manage to run a balanced budget in over 20 years...
1923 2018-11-08 09:06:29 you realise everything you say is on record? You will go down as one of the biggest laughing stocks in human history.

1925 2018-11-08 09:05:58 Sigh. When you have no choice to buy something from a seller because they’re the only place that stocks it even though their customer service is shit 
1926 2018-11-08 09:05:35 I still have my short position open, I’m using it as a hedge for my portfolio.  If the S&P retests the 2600 bottom, I expect the ASX and Aussie Nanking stocks to nose dive.

1946 2018-11-08 08:52:04 Trading Forex but even that requires that you read plenty of books and study stocks but once you're in it you're not stress sef.
1947 2018-11-08 08:51:11 That is simply ridiculous...the FFs weren’t prescient...they had no insight into bump stocks or social media...The US can’t keep living in the past or the world will pass her by...Apple alone is more powerful than the FFs whole little “experiment”...time to join the 21st century!

1968 2018-11-08 08:35:25 So Jeff Sessions resigns and pot stocks rally big. At least something good came of Trump's anomie for the former Attorney General. Lets hope the pot rally doesn't go up in smoke #potstocksjeffsessions #jeffsessions
1969 2018-11-08 08:34:03 Remember Stewie, many of the stocks that made big gains yesterday had big losses for weeks and many are still well below where they were.  We've missed all that and sit with our capital intact to benefit from the next clearly trending market.

1989 2018-11-08 08:17:08 Bottomline - either PE will become 1/2 or there'll be a long consolidation. It's to be always expected with such stocks IMO.

That said, i would never underestimate a good adaptive management. 

There are more such stocks but here visibility is EXTREMELY high.

1998 2018-11-08 08:12:04 I actually think 3-4 is a better fit. Only reason we played 2 stocks in 4 is generally the game was slower and certain characters would camp even harder with high stock counts. Would've made competitive a snooze fest to watch. This game though is much faster and stocks can be

2001 2018-11-08 08:07:46 Btw, I'm team two stock. This game just looks faster but it's more technical so I feel like we should stick to 2 stocks. 3 stocks might be exhausting. But we'll see.

2007 2018-11-08 07:57:53 Poeple try to understand jay @niftywizard  is a pure trader just seeking 200 or 300 point move which he will get. But as a investor don't look for only 200 point move. Just find good opportunity to invest at lower. Just see stocks have moved 20% from 10000 level in just 10 days.

2011 2018-11-08 07:52:30 Companies all over the S&P 500 were buying back stocks since the early 2000s. A big cut of their earnings went into that. What I don’t understand is, why would you have to give them such a massive tax cut to encourage something they are doing already?
2012 2018-11-08 07:51:53 Green New Deal was never tried. Pouring money into stocks based on speculation that government might buy lots of panels isn't a plan, it's chronyism. Examples of gov plans: Setting a national renewable energy standard of 70% by 2040, $200/ton fee & dividend on CO2, etc.

2045 2018-11-08 07:10:52 For 2018, the DII investments into equities should cross the 120K crores.

Make no mistake, that's a HUGE number (round $17 billion). 

Some good pedigree stocks might not become cheaper anytime soon, if this kind of inflow continues.

I see no particular reason for it not to.

2079 2018-11-08 06:31:55 Investors do imitate each other. At this point, everyone is holding a lot of cash to buy stocks after elections; because election results can make the markets fall 31.37%. Who is doing things differently?

2088 2018-11-08 06:23:38 Why do you judge people?  You don’t know them just like you assumed I knew nothing about immigration. People are individuals - some are escaping real terror. I have visited myself.
2089 2018-11-08 06:22:49 Ok and many have bought stocks that tanked afterwards as well.  If someone invests or trades in any market without technical skilll they’ll get destroyed.  Nothing to do specifically with crypto
2090 2018-11-08 06:22:42 Yes. But this also creates a opportunity for active investors to get a ready made buyer for stocks that are going down the drain.
2091 2018-11-08 06:21:37 It is frightening man. They are so deep into #MAGA that Trump could literally be putting millions of Roubles in his pocket and they'd say "he's just trying to devalue it so the stocks soar!" Or say ... "something something Soros"
2092 2018-11-08 06:21:27 Actually I do. My father immigrated here. We sponsored my cousins for their citizenship.  Continue on in your life of hate. It’s all yours.
2093 2018-11-08 06:21:09 Morning all! 

- Asian stocks were mostly higher as they took impetus from the post-election rally seen on Wall St where all majors gained at least 2%
2094 2018-11-08 06:21:07 Nikkei 225 closes higher by 1.82% at 22,583.43 #stocks
2095 2018-11-08 06:21:06 Focus on the tails is misleading.The dud stocks that go to zero(?) will figure on the left tail and on the right tail there will be obscure stocks that deliver astounding returns. I think that's the way indexing works, no?
2096 2018-11-08 06:19:38 More than anything else, all food commodity prices nose dived, all veggies prices selling rock bottom, as traders are not holding stocks  The common man is most benefitted
2097 2018-11-08 06:19:21 going to end badly....  just like crypto stocks that they hyped at the top....  Careful people.
2098 2018-11-08 06:18:47 @Deishma out of all the diwali stocks recommended, if you had to pick two of them, which one would you pick?
2099 2018-11-08 06:18:39 Hedge funds suffered their worst month in October, in 7 years, down 3%, as Hedge Fund Research index, that tracks all strategies, was hit by a sell-off in technology stocks.
2100 2018-11-08 06:17:31 Jeff - I feel sorry for you.  Your response is really sad.  But you’re incorrect - we need people to harvest crops, do lawn care, clean toilets. Change the channel and open your mind.

2104 2018-11-08 06:13:09 (Bloomberg) -- After endorsing a #Republican-dominated government two years ago, investors decided they also like a divided Washington. Stocks in Asia followed a strong #US session overnight, spurred by the narrative that checks and balances bode well for returns.

2116 2018-11-08 06:00:04 Are putting any action behind this bill and call for @senatemajldr to act? Words with no action are just words and empty gestures. There is still no Ban on Bump Stocks. All the victims get is thoughts and prayers.

2121 2018-11-08 05:56:36 its a shame. but as they repeat often, there are other projects for diablo in the works and all it would take for their stocks to recover is by announcing any of the other diablo games.

2130 2018-11-08 05:46:25 No the interest they’re (Robinhood) is referencing in the paragraph I attached above is uninvested money (cash/buying power). The interest stated at the end of the paragraph is saying you can earn additional interest on certain stocks as well.

2135 2018-11-08 05:38:52 Took a look at some old stocks I was in. $ATVI down 25% in a month. Part of that due to negative feedback to the new #DiabloImmortal.

I watch whole numbers on all my charts (350, 351, etc) and just watch. Certain stocks respect those whole numbers.

2187 2018-11-08 04:39:51 Certainly no fictitious tax cuts for the middle class (never intended to happen), and trade issues might get a lot quieter too. Maybe that helps stocks? I don’t know, but I’m not interested in them, and global growth is dropping away.

2193 2018-11-08 04:34:54 I don't think so. Your system could be long, short or flat some of those stocks in the ETF or index. Don't give up that diversification.

2212 2018-11-08 04:21:53 You know how there are some things that people ask you to buy the good ones that can last you a lifetime even if they're slightly more expensive?

Yeah, that's what I do for stocks too.
2213 2018-11-08 04:21:13 GNFC .. to that extent is unlike its other twin GSFC .. your point taken ... and there fore did not recommend Gas Stocks although Gas is expected to Flare .. as the GOI will on higher prices will offer disinvestment as we approach Mar19.
2214 2018-11-08 04:20:01 Some stocks look ready to top here, RSI on the indexes dropped all day while the price rallied. Some sell orders end of day, but also VIX is low here. I think maybe tomorrow could start to top out.
2215 2018-11-08 04:19:54 Sad though that @Blizzard_Ent  doesnt understand that their fans don’t want mobile games but we want pc games. Their stocks are going to dip so low from more hate their going to receive.

2244 2018-11-08 03:59:58 Most stocks are bloody over priced. Some of the stock valuations don't make any sense.
2245 2018-11-08 03:58:29 is there a problem with stocks? the number is quite low today.

2247 2018-11-08 03:56:01 Because there's no evaporation, you need to reduce to concentrate stocks. Because there's no dry heat, not even the trace malliard you get in the oven or on stove. But the extraction more than makes up for both.

2268 2018-11-08 03:41:38 Depends on the branch tbh, some don't have any accs at all, so I always just pass by each one ai come across to check stocks
2269 2018-11-08 03:41:30 Listening to men discuss stocks is exactly like hearing them talk sports. It's fanatical philosophy about a fabricated perception of how the game works on a professional level.

2287 2018-11-08 03:26:53 As horrendous as October was for stocks, November has provided a snap back in its first 7 days. DOW, NASDAQ and S&P all gained more than 2% in a single day, today.
2288 2018-11-08 03:25:53 A $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 in 1976 would be worth $860,233 as of 12/31/17.  The more of your net worth is in appreciating assets (stocks, real estate, businesses), the more your net worth expands during flush economic times without really doing shit.

I do wish I had predicted Sessions leaving, marijuana stocks (no doubt due to his “good people don’t smoke marijuana” stance) definitely shot up.
2291 2018-11-08 03:23:48 You have to understand the difference between sector leaders like Apple, and runners leaders like TLRY, in our case, the pot stocks, the stock that started the run is the leader, the rest followed, sympathy plays, this rule you can apply it to the penny stock world

2295 2018-11-08 03:22:32 What’s is wrong with banning bump stocks or high capacity rifles? If it means saving lives isn’t it worth it?
2296 2018-11-08 03:22:20 When money supply high in system
RBI raise interest rates to control it

When money supply low in system
RBI reduce interest rates to increase supply

Currently liquidity crunch, I think RBI won't raise interest rates which is quite positive for stock market and stocks.

2330 2018-11-08 02:57:11 That’s not true. Some corporations use their tax cuts for stock buybacks and some corporations use some of their tax cuts to invest in cheaper productions overseas. Trump taxcuts was basically used by companies to buy stocks and pay dividends. More layoffs after tax cut than b/4.

I’m joking but also I have actually had people bring up bump stocks in defense of conflating semi with full auto
2345 2018-11-08 02:45:04 #StockMarket put money back in stocks for very short term. Week or two tops. Catch after election rise than get out before tarrifs, rate hikes, investigations, and god knows what else.

2355 2018-11-08 02:42:09 Here's to hoping marijuana stocks jump to $420 a share now that Jeff Sessions has been fired
2356 2018-11-08 02:41:26 Jeff Sessions = fired
Weed stocks = up 
Take it as you will
2357 2018-11-08 02:41:20 @cenkuygur interesting, I see where Aurora Cannabis was already breaking out. Could it be coincident? Overall market went up, while Marijuana stocks have fallen during the correction.

Is Whitaker from the Boehner branch of the GOP?

2358 2018-11-08 02:40:27 I got 2 free stocks from using a friend’s code signing up and from also referring a friend. I got sprint and some oil company but I’m investing my own money into medical marijuana
2359 2018-11-08 02:39:53 Thank you Tim, I thought so but, still wanted to ask!
2360 2018-11-08 02:38:25 yup, use @StocksToTrade otherwise you miss out on a lot of stocks other platforms couldn't give 2 shits about
2361 2018-11-08 02:37:00 Check the stocks! @realDonaldTrump keeps bragging about the market, Obama says he started the snowballs, E. All of the above  Keep your eyes open may be a drop will fall our way. Illinois gov race spent 300million and I didn't make a penny. SMH! !

2365 2018-11-08 02:35:15 The Common Fisheries Policy should never have been agreed and hopefully we will get out of it with Brexit. In this policy we gave all our fish to the EU. Why? because Germany didn't have any fish.  This one act decimated the UK fishing industry and fish stocks.
2366 2018-11-08 02:34:56 That’s pretty much it. Suspension due to PED use that I don’t think he was at fault for. His college numbers were pretty insane. NBA is super risk averse today, player stocks plummet overnight. Look at Michael Porter Jr. MGKS called it tho

2390 2018-11-08 02:21:09 I bet guillotine stocks are a good buy.
2391 2018-11-08 02:20:32 Pot stocks going crazy
2392 2018-11-08 02:19:56 Do they even provide receipts at all? Even at the ATM, you get a receipt... And I loathe the idea of political parties owning stocks/trademarks in these machines coughcough Ivank Trump coughcough...
2393 2018-11-08 02:18:57 My understanding is that most of the stocks will be worth between $2.50-$10. But some people have gotten higher end stocks. I didn’t but it’s still $3.50 more than I had earlier.
2394 2018-11-08 02:18:24 Stock market very hard, I've been investing since 1977 , my father bought high quality stocks got me involved, I take more risk than he ever did, takes much time & work & research, most everyone I know has a professional money manager. Good show to watch to learn @MadMoneyOnCNBC
2395 2018-11-08 02:18:04 “When railroad stocks collapsed after a bubble in the 1800s, it didn’t mark the death knell of the railway. Nor did the dot-com crash destroy the internet. Instead they weeded out the bad companies and paved the way for a technology revolution.”

2397 2018-11-08 02:16:05 LOL i think they are trying to clear the leftover stocks before the next release... so it depends luck I guess?
2398 2018-11-08 02:15:57 OTC stocks are not as liquid as directly listed Canadian cannabis stocks. It’s possible to buy directly from the CSE in the US, but your options are limited and trades are generally expense to perform. BMO is $50/trade plus other hidden fees I prolly don’t know about
2399 2018-11-08 02:15:46 I would imagine most of these hardass SEALs are above childish jokes and would laugh at some weakass kid trying to poke fun at them. I can't imagine many of them would take to twitter to tell a fake Pete Davidson account to "watch their back" while traveling.
2400 2018-11-08 02:15:14 The other obvious trade here is marijuana stocks. With Mr. Magoo gone they are probably going to rally. No positions yet.

2404 2018-11-08 02:12:52 I’m not convinced technology stocks are finished with their selloff. A lot of sectors have already gone through their respective bear markets. A retest would be great for tech but extreme pessimism might prevent it.
2405 2018-11-08 02:12:39 @elonmusk could you please, please, please, subscribe to pewdiepie and host meme review I will actually buy tesla stocks
2406 2018-11-08 02:12:25 Im trying to decide, only thing i own right now is $F for the dividend. Holding cash until i find something else i like. I was hoping the #BlueWave would be real so the market would crash so i could buy in cheap. I will keep you posted, im watching a lot of stocks right now.
2407 2018-11-08 02:12:02 #Stocks,#Indexes Should mention the selloff-correlated top signal temporal component of October was 1.6 times that of January.
2408 2018-11-08 02:11:58 Did anyone else notice that as soon as there was even a hint of discussion about raising interest rates that stocks started pulling back?
2409 2018-11-08 02:10:43 Should have just bought stocks
2410 2018-11-08 02:09:59 Did the same with my day trade stocks lol
2411 2018-11-08 02:09:14 5 first half stocks (3 blocks / 2 steals) for JJJ, who also added 12 points on offense. He's growing up quickly.
2412 2018-11-08 02:09:14 You need discipline in everything you do. Don't be afraid of what is to come. No one can time the market. TURN OFF THE TV. Learn how to value companies, buy what you think is undervalued (don't guess, study #'s), and purchase lots of your stocks regularly (dollar cost averaging).
2413 2018-11-08 02:09:02 ED I am said: American People Trump tout polls when it suites him but polls come from “the news” like CNN so how can CNN be fake news if you use there polls for your advantage, Fake News, no Trump you are fake news the divider Lies, stocks fall like rock he said!!!

2418 2018-11-08 02:06:39 Here's the secret about FTDs people: by far, most of them fail. They mean nothing outside of the context of what individual stocks are doing - therefore focusing on the action of individual stocks and understanding bottoming formations in stocks is critical...
2419 2018-11-08 02:06:37 Danny and his mom have been telling me I should stick it out bc I have about $1400 in stocks that vest in the next month. But honestly I dk if I can.
2420 2018-11-08 02:05:35 Surprised..why don’t news channels and others circulating fake news have received Notices from SECP/PSX/SBP..such type of news can seriously affect banks’ stocks..
2421 2018-11-08 02:05:14 Calvin you clearly own stocks in whatever that soap is that literally all Mexicans use
2422 2018-11-08 02:04:17 It’s hard to be a long-term investor when you watch your stocks every second. If you want to be a better investor, get rid of all distractions that promote short-term thinking. Turn off the TV and pick up a book and learn something that is additive to your long-term success.

2433 2018-11-08 01:56:43 $VFF is one of the more frustrating stocks but a great company. I owned it as low as $1.6 and thought it was a no brainer, but management still operates like a vegetable company. They’re conservative in every way, which is good LT, but in the meantime they can’t sell the story.
2434 2018-11-08 01:56:20 and ... forest stocks stay stable, the USA constructs 1M houses a year, over the last 30 years and doesn't loose forest cover (there was a huge loss of forests in the 18th and 19th century from farming and just burning it all.
2435 2018-11-08 01:55:47 You realize there was a national assault weapons ban from 1994-2004? No one’s weapons were confiscated, existing semi-automatic rifles with folding stocks & high-cap mags were still legal to own, buy & sell. The ban applied to new weapons sales.
2436 2018-11-08 01:55:25 Like an emerging market leader.  I spent most of my adult life investing and analyzing stocks and companies in “emerging countries”.  The current administration and much of congress are acting very similar to what I’ve seen in these places.

2475 2018-11-08 01:33:34 Firing Sessions had one positive effect. "... the ouster of Sessions lifted marijuana stocks. Sessions has been a vocal opponent of legalizing pot in the United States. Shares of Canopy Growth (CGC), Cronos (CRON) and Aurora Cannabis (ACB) soared nearly 10%."
2476 2018-11-08 01:32:51 Ive surprisingly gotten DMs relating to long setups that I use for tickers like $TTNP, Ive scored two 20% ROI trades in the past two weeks .... and my honest reply is I'm not a seasoned trader when it comes to recognition of some setups especially volatile penny stocks
2477 2018-11-08 01:32:42 how much of today was squeezing? I just longed a little bit of  IQ yesterday and added half of position on aapl this morning. a lot of stocks on watchlisf bump up so fast tha I was afried to catch them.TTD SQ CRM
2478 2018-11-08 01:31:20 #Stocks,#Indexes So, what exactly supports the bear case for the "main" trend? First, the early October SPX top signal exhibited a temporal component of a duration seen at only the late January top, i.e., at no top since then.  This component is significantly correlated with...

2480 2018-11-08 01:31:02 The new congress should be working on the people’s business not monkey politics as usual. GM announced buyouts of 18K workers & stocks of American Automakers are at their 8 years low, while Foreign automakers are thriving! Law Makers should working on MAGA not Foreign Countries.
2481 2018-11-08 01:30:15 I will miss some of the flavors, But never enough to make me purchase from your company. 
The really sad part of this is that many people did not vote for Trump. Many will find this crude swipe at Trump offensive. 
Get ready for a drop in stocks.
2482 2018-11-08 01:30:09 ...I have a problem with growth-stock investing. Companies tend not to grow at high rates forever. Businesses change... Markets mature. Competition can increase. Good managements can retire... the market is littered with once highly profitable growth stocks... -- Ed Wachenheim
2483 2018-11-08 01:29:07 Any thoughts on pot stocks
2484 2018-11-08 01:28:37 Not a bad time to dump under performing stocks.
2485 2018-11-08 01:28:31 Regardless of who you vote for, stocks aren't going to go up in a straight line forever.
2486 2018-11-08 01:27:15 Pots stocks got high today and so did I!

Buying stocks every week. Good Investment too
2489 2018-11-08 01:24:49 #Midcap & #Smallcap #stocks may bottom ahead of #nifty by Jan 19 as the bear market which started in Feb 18 in small & midcap may get over!
2490 2018-11-08 01:24:25 Well then, seems like a nice time to consider cannabis stocks again.
2491 2018-11-08 01:23:10 I have never outsourced the job of identifying, reviewing, editing & again reviewing the list of the next #multibagger #smallcap & #midcap #stocks. This work is always in progress even during bearish times.
2492 2018-11-08 01:22:24 Some parents allow their child to get away with any and everything in schools which makes it hard on teachers. Could you be mad if those teachers began investing money in prison stocks? It might be the next big thing if this is the case! #bigbank
2493 2018-11-08 01:22:15 Pots stocks got high today and so did I! 
2494 2018-11-08 01:21:22 Here’s a twist. What if 45 had someone buying Marijuana Stocks for him. Uses the Meuller Investigation as a ruse to fire Sessions. Guess what happened immediately after Sessions announced his departure. Marijuana stocks went up. Bet 45 is already selling at a huge profit.
2495 2018-11-08 01:18:17 If one is holding stocks below their highs in the marijuana industry or any other sector. That is a sale. Kevin taught me that. Knowing the sale & the sinking ship are key. Remember that show?  #3 or #2  . Iunno. $1 just keeps arriving.
2496 2018-11-08 01:18:05 Not surprised. I dumped my stocks a weeks ago.
2497 2018-11-08 01:17:00 Everyone knows that we should sell stocks before midterms and buy stocks after.
Efficient market hypothesis etc.
2498 2018-11-08 01:16:58 really hope they want are buying stocks--where over one million members. China not acted!
2499 2018-11-08 01:16:31 Sessions resigning is also a big catalyst for the pot stocks
2500 2018-11-08 01:16:14 Invest in CBD stocks
2501 2018-11-08 01:16:03 Id help out all my family members who are struggling, id probably invest it into stocks too.
2502 2018-11-08 01:16:03 Yes. Fact. But maybe they figure barbell it with absurd returns getting in other areas (stocks, private equity, real estate)
2503 2018-11-08 01:14:36 I didn’t see the 7 minute option until after I hit the 6 minute one.
3 stocks seems good at the moment. Not as fast as Melee, but noticeably faster than Sm4sh.
2504 2018-11-08 01:14:35 Many Thanks for your previous assistance in this matter. If remnant or short dated stocks of #Nurishment Strawberry or Vanilla Active Protein still exist in distribution network, I’m interested in taking some on fair valuation.
2505 2018-11-08 01:13:05 Stocks plunged as Philip Morris International Inc. unveiled a cautious giraffe today.
2506 2018-11-08 01:10:41 Will the CNY/USD go down to which will result in higher gold prices? Or will the rally in stocks take away any ST fear of crashes and gold will go down?
2507 2018-11-08 01:09:32 Marijuana stocks are now in a legal market. One would want at minimum to see the companies 1st quartetly report. 1st fiscal year of earnings w/ continous quarterly reviews.  1 year vs 30.
2508 2018-11-08 01:09:08 Pot stocks didn't rise today over the elections silly, it was the departure of AG Sessions!
2509 2018-11-08 01:08:50 - Asia stocks jump
- USD ticks higher
- Treasury yields hold gains
- Crude stable

2510 2018-11-08 01:08:13 The Puss looked around, to find some place for their small experiment. And his eyes stopped at the bookstore itself. And he remembered that there's a few rooms for book stocks, probably there's an empty room for them.

2512 2018-11-08 01:06:35 Stocks in cannabis companies went up immediately after Sessions resignation. I would however suggest you wait until you see what happens in Canada.
2513 2018-11-08 01:05:52 Berry i still own some stocks should i hold?
2514 2018-11-08 01:03:58 Bloomberg reports mj stocks up on the news of his firing.
2515 2018-11-08 01:03:13 I'm not a trader at all, hoping to get there, but it's not a good thing when your investing account makes more in a day than you do in a week.  #stocks
2516 2018-11-08 01:02:16 To the stocks with you
2517 2018-11-08 01:00:48 Yeah I didn’t care. All stocks are centralized but they have to follow laws that protect investors. Xrp was suppose to be pro reg. The problem came when they start saying we owe investors nothing and can do whatever. That’s not an exceptable market. You can’t just take inv. $
2518 2018-11-08 00:58:59 Probably a couple weeks away from launching the start of website I've been working on. Everything is starting to look good locally on my computer. Running a test next week about rendering individual stock dashboards, plan on doing 500 stocks and see how long that takes to run.
2519 2018-11-08 00:57:43 Start wading in on stocks that are hitting buy points. Add to existing position or buy new setups only if initial buys are working.  Monitor the first few days if distribution occurs. An early distribution decreases odds of a successful FTD so be flexible as it can go either way.

2527 2018-11-08 00:53:24 I guess it’s safe to repurchase some $WWE stocks, now that #CrownBooBoo is out of the way. 
2528 2018-11-08 00:53:11 I would say penny stocks are a good start with building your investment portfolio. Start off small and work your way up. #CollegeSense
2529 2018-11-08 00:53:03 Look....we all hoped the misinformed would sell stocks down big today on the shroud of mid-term elections....note to everyone....midterm elections aren’t presidential elections...
2530 2018-11-08 00:52:23 Glad he didn’t choose to put Acosta in stocks on the White House front lawn. Trump is morphing from a tyrant to a despot.

2535 2018-11-08 00:49:04 Stocks love it!
2536 2018-11-08 00:47:33 History indicates that mixed party control in the U.S. is generally the best combination for equity markets,while the highest-growth stocks can keep putting up good numbers even during an economic slowdown.

2540 2018-11-08 00:46:20 I, and the SF Fed, agree that were probably looking at a 2 year bull run. At least in stocks. The BTC chart looks good right now
2541 2018-11-08 00:46:07 Stocks are more appealing to me because I can share things I don't have but need versus going more and more in debt.
2542 2018-11-08 00:45:26 Just remember my deplorable friends. The best way to deal with the bias news and companies out there is to dump their stocks. The pocket book always wins. Turn them off and sell there stock. There are plenty of good American companies that could use our help. We will stay great.

2546 2018-11-08 00:43:12 And wiping out sharks also causes fish stocks to collapse further. Sharks being a scavenger remove the old, weak and diseased fish, which actually improves health of fish populations.
2547 2018-11-08 00:42:09 Hey wolf you playing the pot stocks??
2548 2018-11-08 00:41:04 I been keeping up with stocks with all this damn free time.
2549 2018-11-08 00:41:02 The research going into weed is crazy- and for ppl who think it is all about getting high, there are cbd oils that are medicinally used and do not make you high. It is only a matter of time before legalization- Canada legalized 10/17. I have invested in some of the weed stocks.
2550 2018-11-08 00:40:40 estoy en la misma, yo me estoy comiendo stocks y se dan cuenta, es jodido, se que ellos estan tan mal como la empresa y lo merecen realmente, pero ilusionarlos para despues decirles que tengo que despedir a uno de los 5 porque no me dan los numeros me parece muy cruel para todos

2555 2018-11-08 00:38:02 1. the MARKET didn't know / wasn't allowed to buy; we are that early in the U.S cycle.  People know a handful of cannabis stocks and treat them all the same.  I live this, trust me.

2. Canada will turn buyer so indirectly ur buying US and the space got 'friendlier.'
2556 2018-11-08 00:37:54 Since 1946, there have been 18 Midterm Elections. Stocks were higher 12 months after every single one. Every single one. That’s 18 for 18. Feeling good.

2558 2018-11-08 00:37:43 Hilarious that Jeff Sessions' resignation has sent cannabis stocks soaring. What a legacy
2559 2018-11-08 00:35:05 wtf does @themotleyfool do for anyone. Today I receive on my news app. to buy ACB as quick as possible. 3 hrs later....get out of MY stocks unless I want to lose all my money. God they are assholes.

2562 2018-11-08 00:34:08 Yeah you look like a tough guys in your Mr. T chain and white sunglasses . Scary stuff mogul, especially the fake name that you stole from someone else. Publish your results. You said you would. If you don't you're admitting it's bullshit. The King of Stocks wears no clothes??
2563 2018-11-08 00:33:36 Faster then stocks
2564 2018-11-08 00:33:36 Langers dropped a hint to sell my marijuana stocks in December when they hovered around $3 - $16. Some rose but most of my choices are still on sale. Langers also advises to stay out of oil. One's own decision. She can not comfirm positive results, invest at one's own discretion.
2565 2018-11-08 00:33:21 Markets move in anticipation of, not due to. Hard to explain in 128 characters, but the market moves on what will be, not what is. What is only causes what will be. Get it? So stalemate in DC in current environment=good profits=Stocks up, sharply. What do you have to offer?
2566 2018-11-08 00:33:19 and pot stocks go up!

2571 2018-11-08 00:30:44 VA, I think you should share more detail in your style or methodology in selecting 33 stocks in 11 sectors. It’s a good marketing tool to inform those who may want to move up to portfolio tier.
2572 2018-11-08 00:30:36 In fact, our corn expectation in China is about to run out. There is no more surplus in state storage. By next year, the domestic corn carry-over inventory may only be 50 million tons and it is all commercial stocks.
2573 2018-11-08 00:29:14 riddle me this, if fed hikes to 2.50% in dec and says they are going to pause and 10yr goes to 3.5-3.75%, as long as fed is on hold, do stocks rally or crash like they did in Oct?  or if fed hikes to 3.25% and 10yr goes to 3%, do stocks rally or crash. fed triggerd Oct not 10yr

2578 2018-11-08 00:26:57 I think you misunderstood me. Mark Spiegel is a charlatan. Your agreeing with him, or being in the industry and "understanding the financials" doesn't make you right. You and the streets misunderstanding of tech stocks is legendary. You should shorten your profile to "dinosaur".
2579 2018-11-08 00:26:42 I monitor a couple of hundred stocks every day, so I figured it wouldn't be such a big deal to track the 150 or so BTC pairs on @binance once a week
Time/opportunity cost = almost nil

2584 2018-11-08 00:20:22 The negative argument on $aapl has always been the same for many years
if you're investing and constantly have fear and lack confidence in the stocks you own then you shouldn't be investing.
2585 2018-11-08 00:19:19 So that's a no to publishing your trades? So they're bullshit then? You're not the King of Stocks after all??? Faith Goldy is definitely unimpressed. 
2586 2018-11-08 00:19:14 Stocks seem more appealing because you are buying into a future and can see more growth over time #gsunaacp

2588 2018-11-08 00:18:29 Weed stocks went through the roof today here lol He was such an old guy guy when it came to that
2589 2018-11-08 00:16:40 You could actually be right @jamesdcurry. Once we broke $28 I figured appreciation would accelerate, and it has. I fully expect a run to at least $32 then consolidating before the next leg up. What we really need is for #equities to catch up.  Many stocks should be 50% + higher
2590 2018-11-08 00:16:32 Bitcoin has now become more stable than US Stocks, S&P 500!
2591 2018-11-08 00:16:15 Is that it? Why aren't you concerned about anything more than what the high paid people, that aren't U, in office, on MSM are telling you? Do you care about economy? Peace? Powerful leadership? Stocks? Jobs? Veterans? Or are u as unAmerican as MSM is? I'm ashamed of ppl like you.

2594 2018-11-08 00:15:12 I’d like to give a hearty thank you to Jeff Sessions for resigning today!! My weed stocks are up 30% at market close. They’re at an all-time high! No pun intended. Momma wants to retire early, beotches.
2595 2018-11-08 00:14:32 I Gotta start buying stocks to get to that level
2596 2018-11-08 00:14:11 You know what could've been a smarter move?
If that person really asked the owner or manager of the store on why they have a lot of stocks for BTS..not just quickly taking a picture lol 
2597 2018-11-08 00:12:35 My stocks went down 
2598 2018-11-08 00:12:28 Buy marijuana stocks. Kind of like being in on the ground floor with Apple.
2599 2018-11-08 00:11:37 Lol @ the fact that marijuana stocks went up after sessions left.
2600 2018-11-08 00:10:56 Intraday Short Selling (IDSS) has been implemented since January 2018 by Bursa Malaysia. Traders usually will sell their stocks first and the buy back will take place when the market closes. The deals are usually facilitated by business partners.
2601 2018-11-08 00:10:53 selloff had nothing to do with 10yr yield, stocks will rally into year end and bonds will sell off.  that's my story and i'm stiiiiiiickin to it
2602 2018-11-08 00:10:51 Given how fast paced Smash Ultimate, I think 4 stocks or more would be the best choice. 4 stock 8 minutes. Hell if it's speed is as crazy as "Faster than Melee" would imply then 5 might even be a good choice.
2603 2018-11-08 00:10:34 $SQ Is going to fade big time towards the end of the day tomorrow. FED will be hawkish as stocks have not dropped enough for them to cause concern. Will cherry pick at few metrics that back their view on raising rates
2604 2018-11-08 00:10:05 i was busy busy gettin my undisciplined ass handed to me to day on pot stocks and just saw this , i feel a lot better now! haha
2605 2018-11-08 00:08:39 Bump stocks are a non issue. Raise minimum wage minimally. Create a business environment where workers are paid more. What LGBT discrimination? Background checks for what? Private sales?

2611 2018-11-08 00:05:36 Stocks are usually a better move over a 20+ year period if you watch them carefully or diversify with a mutual fund because they keep up with inflation better over time and the stock market tends to give higher returns #CollegeSense

2614 2018-11-08 00:04:27 Stocks are more appealing because gaining equity is always a benefit #collegesense
2615 2018-11-08 00:04:18 Stocks because it allows you to not keep all your eggs in one basket. #collegesense
2616 2018-11-08 00:04:01 Depends on if you want to take a aggressive investment approach for a greater return then you should invest in stocks. But if you want to take a moderate risk approach with little to low risk and low safe return then you should invest in bonds. #CollegeSense

2624 2018-11-08 00:03:32 I’m sooo happy that my beloved @beautybay finally stocks one of my favourite brands @MeltCosmetics! Bye, bye customs. I did not like you. #meltcosmetics #meltcosmeticsonbeautybay
2625 2018-11-08 00:03:28 A3 Stocks are more appealing because they are more lucrative. #CommonSense
2626 2018-11-08 00:03:16 Stocks because they are able to have a higher return but bonds do have set dividends.
2627 2018-11-08 00:03:10 Bonds. My mom bought 10k of bonds every year since I was born. Now there are over 100K of bonds stored away maturing. Regardless of whether or not the stocks mature, the bonds will mature. Low risk, eventual money. Good for wealthy investors. #CollegeSense
2628 2018-11-08 00:03:07 A3: I think I am team stocks. Although there are times that they may seem volatile, what’s the certainty or cushion if the enterprise goes bankrupt? #CollegeSense

2630 2018-11-08 00:02:42 I definitely wanna see Smash Ultimate have 3 stocks as the standard.

Something different, ya know? I think it'd be really cool to see and make make the competitive scene MUCH more interesting.
2631 2018-11-08 00:02:22 A3- Bonds are debts while stocks are stakes of ownership in a company. #CollegeSense
2632 2018-11-08 00:02:06 how quickly the comppexion changes . bonds at  6 month low and stocks       at a 20 day high         whereas just the opposite 5 days ago
2633 2018-11-08 00:01:58 Is it private prison stocks?
2634 2018-11-08 00:01:53 Bonds because stocks have a greater risk factor
2635 2018-11-08 00:01:30 I think it's pretty fair to say that smash 4 has a ton of very big problems though. 2 stocks and rage being completely insane makes it incredibly inconsistent, edge guarding is nearly impossible, spamming air dodge and roll are good tactics, and thats just to start
2636 2018-11-08 00:01:17 Most Americans wsnt gun control but the NRA funded GOP wont let any form of gun control pass, not even bump stocks.
