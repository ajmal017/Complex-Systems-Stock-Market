42 2018-03-09 21:47:13 That’s true, and he DID bang Jan&Holly, which both were hot commodities.
43 2018-03-09 21:37:43 very nice!
How do you trade commodities in general? CFD contracts or futures?
44 2018-03-09 21:32:56 Exactly. So when it’s the main form of transportation here for grain, oil and lumber, a simple little backlog causes huge huge ripples, in either of those commodities. Overall there needs to be better management for all commodities.
45 2018-03-09 21:27:46 The first of all commodities to be exchanged is labour, and the freedom of man consists only in the exercise of the right to determine for himself in what manner his labour shall be employed, and how he will dispose of its products.

47 2018-03-09 21:20:02 Please explain to me how being practically unable to enter a market and a handful of corporations determining price points for an array of commodities is not a bad thing. They literally have a stranglehold on that market. Competition is basically nonexistent.

54 2018-03-09 20:18:31 I see what Trump is triying to do. A risk i can see. The jobs will suffer because US has greatly gotten addiced for cheaper commodities. War is not only on battle fields, but it's on economies.

57 2018-03-09 20:03:39 Had a 10 minute argument with a philosophy bro who said a commodity is the ideology of capitalism that is able to make things commodities or some stupid shit. He went on to say ideology is themost concrete thing to him.

63 2018-03-09 19:52:50 It's all about commodities
That's what Trump is doing with issues
He is not just negotiating *about* them
He is also negotiating *with* them

Now rethink what he is doing with tariffs & North Korea

69 2018-03-09 19:30:52 What they're "trying" to do is co-opt, dilute, and misrepresent a communist revolutionary who hated everything about America, and hated commodities of any sort. It's not an impressive attempt at inclusion, it's a disgusting way to profit off of an anti-capitalist icon.
70 2018-03-09 19:29:24 The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as “an immense accumulation of commodities,” its unit being a single commodity. Our investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity.

83 2018-03-09 18:15:06 Thought on crypto regulation... if $BTC / $NEO / $ETH are traded like commodities but used as currencies for trades of goods/services AND used to power a network... is it proper to for the SEC to regulate it as an ordinary security?

96 2018-03-09 17:26:03 If you’re just coming into a market that has existed for a while, unless you have a ton of capital to invest, you objectively cannot produce commodities as cheaply as your competitors.

98 2018-03-09 17:16:28 If cryptocurrencies are “commodities,” they fall under the purview of the CFTC in the U.S.  and their "anti-fraud and anti-manipulation enforcement authority,” but also presumably AML requirements, including KYC.

103 2018-03-09 17:09:57 Yeah like I can avoid using commodities? Or do you recommend that I take my minimum wage and buy your organic super ethical products, that were still produced by exploited workers?
104 2018-03-10 23:24:45 Si ganancias de estas empresas se utilizan para satisfacer gasto corriente del país, limitan planes expansión y fortalecimiento empresas q respaldan commodities, maxime cuando Venezuela cuenta con todos atributos para la agricultura y cría, en procura de la soberanía alimentaria
105 2018-03-10 23:21:11 El Petro motiva al inversionista por estar respaldado por los commodities, para obtenerlos, se requiere una infraestructura logística para su exploración, explotación, producción y refinación, que requiere reinversión en capital
106 2018-03-10 23:12:17 If the human body were reduced to its component elements, it's probably worth around $160. But if a body were marketed as a series of commodities (selling blood, organs, skeleton, &c.), you could get a small fortune.
107 2018-03-10 23:11:52 Não sei você, mas mesmo odiando o Lula eu sei reconhecer que o país melhorou durante alguns anos do governo dele, mesmo pegando carona no preço dos commodities e do barril do petróleo.

110 2018-03-10 22:23:22 Maybe you're right. Worldwide #drought was the catalyst from 2006 to July 2008.

111 2018-03-10 22:02:04 Yes. Things are changing, but those changes are not yet complete. Nor is there any guarantee that they’ll be successful. Either way, women will continue their efforts to be treated like human beings, not commodities.

125 2018-03-10 23:21:11 El Petro motiva al inversionista por estar respaldado por los commodities, para obtenerlos, se requiere una infraestructura logística para su exploración, explotación, producción y refinación, que requiere reinversión en capital
126 2018-03-10 23:12:17 If the human body were reduced to its component elements, it's probably worth around $160. But if a body were marketed as a series of commodities (selling blood, organs, skeleton, &c.), you could get a small fortune.
127 2018-03-10 23:11:52 Não sei você, mas mesmo odiando o Lula eu sei reconhecer que o país melhorou durante alguns anos do governo dele, mesmo pegando carona no preço dos commodities e do barril do petróleo.
128 2018-03-10 22:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
129 2018-03-10 22:29:43 You’re always going to lose to the bigger economies with commodities.

If SA wants to excel it needs to create products from our commodities
130 2018-03-10 22:23:22 Maybe you're right. Worldwide #drought was the catalyst from 2006 to July 2008. Do we need a reason besides fertilizer's efficiency in a drought-stricken climate with bullish long-term low-risk patterns on #commodities? #CommCycle2 emerging. #Water = $MOS $NTR * $DBC $DBA / $USO
131 2018-03-10 22:02:04 Yes. Things are changing, but those changes are not yet complete. Nor is there any guarantee that they’ll be successful. Either way, women will continue their efforts to be treated like human beings, not commodities.
132 2018-03-10 21:55:33 "Show the world we have one normal politician in Canada" okay sure. when is your side gonna offer one

144 2018-03-10 19:42:07 Of course it is fair economic dope. Cheapest marginal cost of production.  Resources labor commodities. That's why you & family make your junk overseas.
145 2018-03-10 19:18:29 If you're selling a commodity to make profit, money to commodity for more money, you are acting as a capitalist.

Money exists as a means of exchange for various commodities, not for the production of wealth.

By selling sex for labor vouchers, the goal becomes to collect capital
146 2018-03-10 19:11:01 "He also said commodities will outperform in 2018 amid a late-cycle boom."  Got it, saved in predictions folder. I hope if he changes his mind to inform us. Is this the new Jim Rogers BTW?
147 2018-03-10 19:07:22 American are shorted-sighted compared to older cultures. China is playing the long game; locking up commodities like petroleum & minerals as well as setting up new markets for their goods. US just plays politics & fights itself.
148 2018-03-10 18:58:11 I'm talking about scarcity like hunger among the poorer people by removing them from the land from which they made sustenance and housing before and then were forced to buy food and shelter as commodities. That's what i'm talking about.
149 2018-03-10 18:56:24 Dear Priminister Sir. We welcome the idea of Janbhagidari.The Farmers problems could be addressed at micro level be it preservation of fruites, veritable, milk or other perishable commodities, we have to make such cold chain at village to village on Cooperative basis
150 2018-03-10 18:46:04 Economia não funciona assim. Índia não tem disposição e nem perfil econômico para substituir a China no comércio global de commodities. 16 estados da federação tem a China como principal parceiro.
151 2018-03-10 18:43:20 Exactly. Which is also why trading 1.01 (Barkley) for proven elite commodities (DJ, Evans, etc) is crazy when landing spot is completely unknown

153 2018-03-10 18:31:27 Commodities su svugde jeftiniji gde postoje instrumenti slobodnog tržišta koji snižavaju njihove cene. Uvek je nestašica kad god birokrate određuju šta ti koliko treba. Globalizacija je odlična stvar pogotovu za ekstremno siromašne zemlje.
154 2018-03-10 18:22:08 Also an older one I really like it's Transport Tycoon. I generally just turn off competitors and make it a slow one player strategy game of connecting people and commodities to each other.

156 2018-03-10 18:11:15 This holds true to all commodities...if you can't compete with China why are you forcing consumers to buy indian high priced steel? Investment cost of our plants and machineries are going up due to increase in steel prices
157 2018-03-10 18:03:43 Mine does too, for all those expensive hard to find commodities like bread you can buy cheaper elsewhere.
158 2018-03-10 17:55:43 Correct.  The difference is once China controls enough physical supply, they can control the pricing of commodities as it suits them which will also allow them to control the int'l trade value of the USD thru those commodities.  They have played "Monetary Moneyball"
159 2018-03-10 17:54:14 As a woman all I want is for female idols to be loved & taken care of like ppl not like walking money making commodities by their companies
160 2018-03-10 17:53:48 Export the WV wildcat strike to other states, arm the teachers with guillotines, the wealthy and government officials only see you as commodities for exploitation. Teacher-student USSA commune now
161 2018-03-10 17:49:42 Cuz they have many holes and can plug a lot with picks and known commodities that the trade will bring back. Plus he’s gonna cost a ton, plus he’s a constant distraction and immature.
162 2018-03-10 17:40:53 Commodities distribution will be Monday, 3/12 from 10 a.m. - 2 p.m at the South Neighborhood Center, 522 Old Maryville Pike. Please bring a photo ID.
163 2018-03-10 17:30:08 Pa, nije baš. Farmerke su bile prosto skuplje tada. Nekada je VHS recorder bio 1000 DM, a danas kudikamo sofisticiraniji Playstation 300€. Commodities su sad jeftine zbog Kine i globalizacije. Sve što smo trebali da uradimo bilo je da održimo standard i ne pravimo veliku srbiju.
164 2018-03-10 17:28:29 Multi-currency pricing of commodities will begin to shift FX to trade on BoP fundamentals they always have up until 1971: Country w highest trade balance & Reserves had strongest currency.  That would mean ranking of CNY, EUR, JPY, GBP, USD.
165 2018-03-10 17:24:32 Seems like CB, WR and maybe DT will be hottest commodities in FA. Which means value will be elsewhere.

169 2018-03-10 16:47:38 Si total ellos gobernaron mal y ustedes ahora también. Lamentablemente nos jodemos los que consumimos gasoil y competimos por commodities de exportación. Liberen y compitan o acaso Antel no fue mucho más eficiente con la libre competencia?
170 2018-03-10 16:40:34 That proves that bad marriage - or bad partnership - does exist. It has nothing to do with whether or not prostitutes or housewives 'sell their bodies'.

And I doubt if objectifying women as economic commodities (product, service, license?) improves the debate.
171 2018-03-10 16:22:50 Bearing arms, free speech, and due process are no longer rights for much of the left. What are rights to them are commodities like food, education, heathcare, etc. Of course, having the right to a commodity means you have the right to a person's labor i.e. indentured servitude.
172 2018-03-10 16:22:34 Is she a commodity.? and you wonder why most nigerian wives are treated 3d like commodities
173 2018-03-10 16:20:08 It was making no sense because I tried to use your analogy. It is too simplistic to apply to global commodities markets.
174 2018-03-10 15:59:39 Argentina tiene que dejar de mirar a Europa, USA y un poco a Brasil con quienes no tenemos economías complementarias y empezar a mirar a Asia para vender commodities y alimentos elaborados que podemos producir competitivamente.
175 2018-03-10 15:56:20 You clearly approve of Corbyn blowing on his racist dog whistle  blaming immigrants "workers from central Europe in order to destroy conditions, particularly in the construction industry." and the sinister way he de-humanises them referring to them a commodities to be "imported".

177 2018-03-10 15:43:12 Marco, dá uma olhada nos tweets do @hbredda . Ele explica muito bem (como poucos) este tema (muito em linha com o que eu penso, principalmente vinculado ao ciclo do dólar/commodities). Brasil é fornecedor do mundo e muito sensível à estes ciclos.
178 2018-03-10 15:36:34 The most effective way to get rid of sex trafficking is to remove the mindset of people as commodities and the entitlement of being able to pay to rape others. If you have to pay for consent it’s not consent.
179 2018-03-10 15:36:22 Twitter surprises me with the #International access & connections. I didn’t expect 2 engage & share #Research with #Canadians #Aussies #Argentinians or connect across #Europe. It’s brilliant’LearnHow2Learn’ when #Investing#Commodities #Lithium @dszuster1 @kirillklip @CrowStu

181 2018-03-10 15:31:40 Perhaps the best you can say is that @jeremycorbyn's words are open to interpretation. When I hear 'importing cheap ... labour' I can't help thinking of commodities in shipping containers. I still find Corbyn ambiguous & too concerned with accommodating xenophobes for my taste.
182 2018-03-10 15:30:09 Yo le he subido un 30% aportación a cobas y 60% a azvalor, muy de acuerdo en su apuesta por commodities
183 2018-03-10 15:24:32 Because it is a misleading framework for popularising Ricardo’s insights. It would be more effective to argue in favor of free trade based on the relative cheapness of foreign commodities. This is actually the rule for specialisation that both Smith and Ricardo used.
184 2018-03-10 15:22:57 whither he goes, change happens. hopefully we can liberate the countries of SA from their travails.  the people are eating from the garbage at present. there is no reason for them too.  they have commodities for the market.  bring them on board.
185 2018-03-10 15:20:37 It's like another words of saying let's get on with Brexit but let plebs like us be ready to consume substandard commodities.

187 2018-03-10 15:01:38 Rare commodities are worth more than good
188 2018-03-10 14:52:32 LOL at NWSL fans thinking Christen Press/any player should be able to choose where they play. Do you watch professional sports? In what other sport, do players dictate which roster they join?? At the end of the day, professional leagues are a business & players are commodities.
189 2018-03-10 14:41:48 I’d argue it’s wrong to compare banks and cryptos, should look at the commodities or currency market. There’s still so much room to grow!!
190 2018-03-10 14:33:30 The #NFL free agency market is fairly weak this year and several teams have money, which means inflated prices. #Browns GM John Dorsey wisely traded for known commodities with their arsenal of draft choices, which were accumulated by Sashi Brown. Both should get credit.
191 2018-03-10 14:12:35 A rich commodities trader and 25 year MEP is going to fight the establishment HOW, @lbc?

196 2018-03-10 13:58:57 Não não, O Brasil cresceu apesar do Lula, graças ao Boom das commodities e a ele manter o programa do FHC no primeiro mandato dele, o que durou até 2008, sendo que o ladrão era pra ter sofrido impeachment no Mensalão, mas foi protegido pelo congresso e pela imprensa.

203 2018-03-10 13:09:54 and it fulfils the threat that, as with ppl with learning difficulties, the frail elderly have become commodities. To be traded. It's dehumanising. It leads to degraded services.

206 2018-03-10 12:52:14 Ah yes. The ‘importing’ labour comment. I’m not sure he meant it like that. I think he was trying to imply that that was what businesses were doing. Treating people like commodities.
207 2018-03-10 12:51:23 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
208 2018-03-10 12:29:26 triggered ako, sobrang pinagtatakpan nung speaker from DOF kanina yung apparent and significant effects naman ng TRAIN sa prices of goods and commodities, eh bakit ba kasi sila magooffer ng fuel vouchers and unconditional cash transfers kung hindi significant yung effect HELLO
209 2018-03-10 12:13:34 If a buy a new car, I will register it outside of Lagos, same goes for renewals. If rent and price of commodities go up because of the new land use charge, I will move to another state. I can't come and kee myself.
210 2018-03-10 12:09:14 So trades in commodities are not governed by universal laws like supply and demand then. It all depends on the nature of the commodity. Interesting.

213 2018-03-10 11:50:13 1) Musk is unusually candid about his beliefs. Of course he's also great a marketing :-)

With all our education we still submit to abuse like that, terrible
227 2018-03-10 08:50:28 Thank you for your economics 101. Obviously immigrants are not just suppliers of labour but consumers too. Your statement also totally ignores that we are PEOPLE,not commodities, and this hurts more than you can ever imagine.
228 2018-03-10 08:28:15 and sellers of commodities. As vectoral production develops, the means of production, the very freedom it will never forgive me for.
229 2018-03-10 08:24:55 Referring to EU citizens coming to the UK for gainful employment as "importing cheap labour", you are purposefully, and disgracefully, dehumanising them.

They are not commodities, not items of trade for import. They are human goddamn beings.

@jeremycorbyn - you are a disgrace.
230 2018-03-10 08:20:21 You finally get a chance to see a whole new product and now you don't want to?

236 2018-03-10 07:18:43 I just wonder if any UFA wants to be here, and whether #canucks will want them at this time.

A top D man and big (skilled) winger are tight commodities, and they would not be traded here for our castoffs. UFAs like Carlson and Kane would fill those needs, but they are UFAs: $$$$
237 2018-03-10 07:06:52 We’re in a protection racket that damages poorer countries and raises prices of basic commodities for our own poorest. 
I said five years  when you  pushed for a time limit. I’ve no idea, we’ve never left the #EU before. But it’ll be worth it to be free to trade in our own terms
238 2018-03-10 06:43:40 Maybe it was stolen?!? Those are hot commodities- no??
239 2018-03-10 06:21:54 If they can survive for 9months without a single pay. They must be getting money from somewhere meaning they are not dedicated to the job.
Wait, they survived through this fuel scarcity with its attendant increase in other commodities, with 3/4 of a year's salary owed, JOKES.

242 2018-03-10 05:24:33 We must never trade our humanity, sexuality, sanity or comfort solely for monetary gain, nor should we pay for professional services from people or corporations that place profits ahead of our well-being.  To do so reduces us to commodities.
243 2018-03-10 05:17:10 Hola @CoinRico, esa es la guía para activos tradicionales, en mi opinión las crypto al ser otro tipo de activo cuenta con relaciones de Fibo diferentes a las de acciones o commodities, por ejemplo STEEM tuvo un Cup&Handle MASIVO el año anterior, con un retroceso de 78.6%, Saludos
244 2018-03-10 05:02:14 Tariffs will raise the price of American made combines and tractors at the same time a trade war lowers the price of American  ag commodities. I don't think this will end well
245 2018-03-10 04:36:29 If commodities were not sold in USD, then the only use foreigners would have for Eurodollars would be Offshore Bank liabilities (trying to dodge FDIC insurance) and buying goods from Americans.  American trade deficit negates the selling to Americans. (continued 3rd tweet..)
246 2018-03-10 04:29:49 Wilmar is owned jointly by Singaporean kuok group and ADM the largest agri commodities player in the world
247 2018-03-10 04:01:13 Daryl, we had the ammo because of moves Sashi and Depodesta put together.  Do you think we would have made an impact and got what we got if he was pissing in the wind about whether he was adequate getting value for giving up unknown commodities?  1-31.  Lucky Dorsey owns a pair.
248 2018-03-10 03:55:25 PLEASE STOP. He doesn't need anymore hype. Ppl. Already see him above guys like A.B.,lev bell,nuke,D.j. & he hasn't even played in the league. I get that there's reason 2 B excited but how about trusted commodities who will probably still be in the league for another 3-5yrs.
249 2018-03-10 03:37:45 We should just rescind the anzus treaty!. That would fix shit so we no longer will be dragged into point warfare with religion used as a guise for power over the dollar and our commodities!.
250 2018-03-10 03:14:55 Note who our biggest trading partners are (China & Japan) and note what the largest traded commodities are (Iron ore and yep you guessed it COAL)
We have an abundance of coal & yet we have some of the highest priced electricity in the world thanks to renewable energy targets
251 2018-03-10 03:14:46 Inverted yield curve warns recession is imminent and it’s a matter of timing. November 2007 started yet commodities including oil hit all time highs, summer 2008. Then the bottom fell out!
252 2018-03-10 03:11:18 Most heinous crime of humanity is buying and selling other humans (women) like commodities. Society is silent hence complicit. Ppl r like it didn't happen to me so y shd i care? Sad.
253 2018-03-10 03:00:25 Ok I traded Iannetta for Brinson. What about throwing CC $34 back (Max, Sale, CC, Synd, Verlander all available at auction) and keep Senzel $4 instead? 20 team at $1k buy in and only top 4 in the $$,the prospects who come up and hit are trade commodities.
254 2018-03-10 02:44:07 I don’t think it is hard to get listed in the block directory, getting the calls are another story. Are you an eligible participant per commodities exchange act section 1a(18)?
255 2018-03-10 02:29:22 @amyklobuchar keep fighting for rural Minnesota and show your support for farmers and the ag industry by doing everything you can to protect the #RFS. Tariffs in other commodities and looming trade wars are bad enough for us, the RFS must stay!
256 2018-03-10 02:28:01 @TinaSmithMN you can make big inroads with your rural constituents early in your term by getting behind the ag community and doing everything you can to protect the #RFS. Tariffs in other commodities and looming trade wars are bad enough for us, the RFS must stay!
257 2018-03-10 02:28:00 yeah, sure, his expertise in international trade, economics, currency, metal market, commodities market, provide him with the "instinct" to find someone who can lie with statistics to "prove" his instincts (what are they anyway sounds like BS to me) stop kissing his ass, be a man
258 2018-03-10 02:15:01 The Jewish guys propaganda boxes is to condition us for ignorance and conform us for conformity and stupidity so we won't question the currency scam from their fraudulent banks to steal our (money diamonds gold silver platinum copper base metals commodities land)
259 2018-03-10 02:11:19 Melo has always been a gifted scorer. Imagine him learning to play defense. Yet still being the offensive threat along w/Billups, and Rip, throw him at 3, and Wallace's. that's a great team. Probably 3 rings. Bias to Celts is curious, but throw 2 proven commodities seems better
260 2018-03-10 01:56:49 Lowball in the fact that its less than they may get in a contract year.

Signing early has its pros/cons for both sides.  Its like commodities trading.  Theres a risk/reward to all.

You sign a guy early & he tanks, then you look just as dumb.
261 2018-03-10 01:23:54 Gaffs are a rare commodities in today's market.
262 2018-03-10 01:06:06 I think the latter half of the year will be good for the $TSX and commodities. I miss the days where the TSX was weighted a little heavier #tech #nortelnetworks #360networks #JDSUniphase

267 2018-03-10 00:32:53 Its a petty state for our country. Farmers on road means all essential food commodities are within the reach of a common man but reality is far from the truth. So, who is making the money! Finally, tax payers have to bear the grunt and common man again will be a victim.
268 2018-03-11 23:54:28 If this is putting one's feet on the ground, we want our feet to remain up. People are hungry. The country is gradually tending to autocracy. Commodities and exchange rate are high. Suicide increased. Ritual killings increased. Boko haram, herdsmen and these are just a few.
269 2018-03-11 23:53:39 Too much self interest involved. In addition, lobbyists have a disproportionate level of influence. When politicians can be bought & sold like commodities, its a sign of a rotten system.
270 2018-03-11 23:53:22 And the notion that the WV teachers are "petit bourgeois" or that teachers "sell commodities" is nuts. Colossus is just deeply confused, and all the reductionism in the world can't shake my class solidarity, even with imperfect proles.
271 2018-03-11 23:47:33 LMAO! You are beyond delusional! ESPN OWNS the SEC Network!!! Owns. Meaning it is in their best interest as stock/share holders to constantly promote and give preference to their commodities (SEC network). You can't even troll well, let alone have an actual debate.
272 2018-03-11 23:46:05 Isn’t that somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy?  Winning in March gets you a great amount of exposure, so marginal 1st/2nd rounders become hot commodities.

283 2018-03-11 22:08:42 okay? i know how commerce works. its why i am here discussing it. a bigger demand by default means treating the animals more like objects or commodities. it cruel to separate a mother from her calf. i can tell you that. i know right from wrong
284 2018-03-11 21:55:39 Not to mention that industrialization has created a system where the capitalism that Adam Smith esposes is not a reality any longer- our labor is bought off & treated like commodities for the capitalist and later the manager. Owners will tend to gravitate to impoverised labor too
285 2018-03-11 21:50:08 The biggest difference it that Petro is launched by the government, and it's also backed up by commodities as oil or gas, so if we analyze it, it would be easier to manipulate than other cryptocurrencies because it will be centralized by the government of Venezuela (intermediary)

316 2018-03-11 20:56:25 I understand those commodities are also really cheap in other third world countries.
317 2018-03-11 20:42:43 You idiot. India was imperialised by the British so it served British interest & not Indian interest. The US has a lot of commodities such as oil which make it rich. However India now has the largest growth followed by China.
318 2018-03-11 20:22:38 NASTRA is fighting for their “right” to commercialize residential areas.  They want to use communities as commodities to enrich themselves.

329 2018-03-11 19:00:10 RW: Consider Using an Energy-Focused Commodities Fund
330 2018-03-11 18:49:51 Right. The funding for extreme high volume, low impact marketing has been paid out. There have been some cool ideas in leveraging the higher impact social commodities, but I think that’s just barely starting to take shape, and those are the ideas that will get funding.
331 2018-03-11 18:48:35 Thanks for following us, @FA_Commodities!
332 2018-03-11 18:36:44 US jobs data was strong, and Trump agreed to meet Kim Jong Un, helping lift equities (S&P500 +1.7%, Nasdaq +1.8% to a record high), commodities and bond yields. The US dollar was muted though.
333 2018-03-11 18:33:37 "their labour power is bought on the market" "but their employer doesn't use it to produce commodities and accumulate surplus value" "okay but imagine what a hard time capitalists would have accumulating surplus value without the services they provide"
334 2018-03-11 18:31:40 I can't tell you how sad I am about the language used here by my party leader. You don't import people. People are not commodities. For the sake of us all, we have to #StopBrexit, it's ruining us as a decent, open society.
335 2018-03-11 18:31:07 It is an interesting one. Does this also apply to white brits (for instance) playing Russians or Sweeds? 
I think it’s about money, at the end of the day - we’re all commodities. If we look vaguely right (certainly with leading cast members, anyway) its how much money we make-um.
336 2018-03-11 18:21:41 Besides being a very stupid reply, it's not entirely true....perhaps you are totally ignorant of how markets work. There are just as many winners/losers when commodities go down as up.
337 2018-03-11 18:18:06 Yes, they classified as commodities this week.
338 2018-03-11 18:14:42 A student asked me if I weren’t a reporter what would I be: theologian, commodities broker, or gardner.
339 2018-03-11 18:06:38 Bell and Evans for me. All of them are proved commodities while Kamara and Hill have only one-year under their belt.
340 2018-03-11 17:46:45 Tariffs on commodities will increase manufacturing as much as open borders increases the Dems voter base. Migrants don't vote and making more steel isn't going to grow the economy.

We should be cherry picking manufacturing sectors we want like high tech products and tariff them.
341 2018-03-11 17:24:32 So.... Pension rise £6.20 per month, Council tax rise £6.40 per month ! Gone in the blink of an eye before the rest of the Annual consumer commodities rises,getting poorer every year !
342 2018-03-11 17:07:14 Pay attention.  Jobs growth is out of the park.  800,000 NEW participants in the job force. Black employment.  Foreign economic commodities taking notice and VOLUNTARILY offering better trade agreements.

He's negotiating. You guys have no idea, and want the failed status quo.

347 2018-03-11 16:44:07 Em 2016, a EMBRAER foi a segunda da pauta de exportação. Como produto, o aeronáutico é o 10° da pauta, sendo os nove primeiros commodities. E ainda fica um bando de gente com complexo de vira-lata falando em vender a companhia. Fala sério!!! Baixa autoestima é um problema!!!
348 2018-03-11 16:38:02 Like eg, the Coachella or Disneyland comment didn't have the same effect purely because it isn't Internet based and real world commodities work in fictional worlds, but Internet stuff is just.. So separate
349 2018-03-11 16:36:36 Agreed fits with my thoughts that commodities pressure in ST but longer-term I'm bullish as I do see dollar down.
350 2018-03-11 16:33:54 I've worked long hours in the past but never that long. These days I keep work hours to a minimum when I can. The way I see it is there are two 'commodities' - time and money. You can always make more money.

353 2018-03-11 16:20:51 Bannon selling hate, bigotry and fear!
The sad reality is those are global commodities 

Purveyors of hate & fear, like Bannon, working to gain money & power on tidal waves of intolerance.
354 2018-03-11 16:19:25 I don't know the details on all the state laws, but the Utah and Arizona legislation explicitly prohibits taxing capital gains on gold and silver. They are regarded as a competing currency to FRNs, not as commodities.

357 2018-03-11 15:22:41 Friend, the handle exists because on many issues today it matters not how much data you have or how much you love those who disagree. No, my mind won’t be changed because I know too many children who have suffered lifelong harm because we have treated them as commodities.

360 2018-03-11 15:05:58 Correct. At a Feb 6, Senate committee meeting,  SEC and CFTC chairs emphasized following the same rules as Securities and/or Commodities. Do the it right and these agencies will not bother you. They want to prevent scams and frauds.

363 2018-03-11 14:58:15 the fact that there are more studies exploring the profitability of corporate social responsibility than the impact it has on its supposed beneficiaries really hits home the fact that workers are literally just seen as mere commodities for profit, the dehumanisation is sickening

367 2018-03-11 14:37:25 Agreed.  And I think people get so caught up in the friendship and community aspect of Twitch they forget that streamers, communities, and viewers are commodities as far as the business aspect of Twitch is concerned.

371 2018-03-11 13:32:05 Just the thought revolts me.. the reality is sex trafficking is big business and children are sold as commodities.. also the issue of county lines a massive concern.

374 2018-03-11 12:58:51 Yes, same. Although treating humans like pieces of property or commodities isn't identical to doing the same with other species, my objection to human slavery isn't based on welfare issues like beatings. I find their enslavement and commodification objectionable in and of itself

376 2018-03-11 12:56:05 If centre govt and state governments can raise DA for it's employees every year,then why all central or state govts do not increase minimum support price of all agricultural commodities every year. Farmers need its due increase also every year by 10%-20%.@PMOIndia @narendramodi
377 2018-03-11 12:51:36 That scary thing called change I guess. Heck why not do them all the drills in pads at the very least. That's why I believe in #fadethecombine but I will admit some more unknown commodities can make themselves known there as well.
378 2018-03-11 12:44:25 Why? The US only cares about power and mo-ney for pink men who call themselves "white". Stop being surprised.  This nation has shown the world over and over again who it really is.  Remember,  the first "commodities" sold on Wall Street   were human beings.

382 2018-03-11 12:04:00 The more you support capitalism the more awful a person you become.

Capitalism forces workers to sell their labour to access basic necessities, and has no limit as to how to extract profit from commodities to accrue capital.

Thus, the best capitalist has no limit for making $$$

387 2018-03-11 11:26:36 I think it is unfortunate. Farmers not compensated at all for the ecosystem services/land stewardship they provide and instead are expected to produce more and more commodities as market demand declines.
388 2018-03-11 11:25:11 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
389 2018-03-11 11:22:53 Another unpopular opinion - States rights should not be a topic in the context of energy policies. Impacts of fuel choices felt way outside of state lines, especially when they involve internationally traded commodities shipped under protection of US military might.
390 2018-03-11 10:26:11 This is how we should see our donkeys - not how they were treated at war. 
They are not commodities but beautiful beings that deserve to be part of #Remembered2018 and every year from now.
391 2018-03-11 10:11:50 Yes, it massively depersonalises the people that come here. It's the first step in seeing people as commodities rather than people with rights and aspirations.
392 2018-03-11 10:04:13 Data is a small part. We're dealing with young human beings here, not commodities.

You put your tax’s on products/commodities, and the EU will do like wise.Then the employees of business effected (on both sides)loose jobs, as trade declines...!
401 2018-03-11 08:35:47 What I heard is that it is more abundant on the Tajik side, where its collection was banned a few years ago. As its value increased, it became one of many commodities exchanged for narcotics. Never seen it in the wild but you’ll find it for sale in Mazar, Kunduz, etc

403 2018-03-11 08:31:43 Is it possible that North Korea has employed a similar strategy to the philadelphia 76ers #trusttheprocess at which theyve starved the public in order to stockpile weapons of mass destruction with the intent to eventually trade for known commodities w/ more dependable value?
404 2018-03-11 07:59:38 @jeremycorbyn I agree with Mat Forsyth “Referring to EU citizens coming to the UK for gainful employment as "importing cheap labour", you are purposefully, and disgracefully, dehumanising them.

They are not commodities, not items of trade for import.”
Disgusting.

412 2018-03-11 07:06:20 When and how did bride trafficking begin?
According to the Punjabi writer, Kirpal Kazak, bride-selling began in Jharkhand after the arrival of the Rajputs. The tribe decorated the women with ornaments, to be sold as ‘commodities’.

425 2018-03-11 04:29:56 Eh, we'll live. They're pretty cheap commodities, compared to the last time we had to shop for one.
426 2018-03-11 04:26:08 I lived in total poverty in the pre-SNAP era. We got commodities once a month. In between we starved. We got sick...a lot. Food boxes are a really really stupid idea.
427 2018-03-11 04:22:33 Don't think there is such a thing. Win, lose, or draw Preds tickets are hot commodities.

430 2018-03-11 04:00:57 That way he can treat the person(s)/animals/objects involved for the commodities as which he sees them. As his mother taught him: you buy it so you can break it. Everyone has a price. Especially when one is working with such tiny hands.

436 2018-03-11 03:00:49 probably it'd be kinda tough (observationally). cost of living is through the roof and you can find that stuff almost anywhere. you'd be better off trying to sell some sort of cultural exchange, but america doesn't have the same commodities hooks they do (that i know of).
437 2018-03-11 02:58:54 Do you?  The places where the USA is getting goods and commodities is polluting the air and water and using child labor. Time to bring it back home.
438 2018-03-11 02:56:53 National Socialist—> Nazi.  They want some kind of dumb racial protection from economic consequences, while also claiming to be “better”- also do stupid things like levy tariffs on steel, to protect native production, without realizing the consequences of expensive commodities.

440 2018-03-11 02:45:31 Yes. Also, many problems for Great Depression+WW II actually trace back to Woodrow Wilson (ex overproduction in commodities like using War Finance Corp to give cheap loans to small farmers, busting relationship w/Japanese, brazen racism, awful at Versailles, etc).
