3 2018-08-25 23:59:24 I’m not sure I understand the praise. I enjoy trav’s work and personally I’m bullish af on crypto in general, but he’s been completely wrong for the entire year, myself as well...yes, bear market almost over I think but I’m confused over what was praiseworthy exactly?

9 2018-08-25 23:58:30 Yes, it is obvious, I still don't agree tho :p
10 2018-08-25 23:58:23 You may not realize it but we are all very early to the game - Crypto is still in its infancy
11 2018-08-25 23:58:22 18 months to throw up some solar panels - ex-stock from ones own factory in Buffalo. Wow.
12 2018-08-25 23:58:14 And this crypto-fascist nursery is apparently a registered charity? Please tell me this is not so!

14 2018-08-25 23:57:55 The World needs more blockchains to solve more problems. The biggest mistake btc people make is the idea that other coins make them weaker. Bitcoin is bigger then all the other projects but its ultimate strength will be that it is the highway that connects all crypto.

22 2018-08-26 23:58:41 Sure, it just looks like if tomato wasn't installed if she bought it secondhand, two botnets must have hit the device. One I assume would have used the router for MITM/crypto mining, and the ransomware attack was clearly targeting SOHO/Enterprise servers but caught a router
23 2018-08-26 23:58:33 Anytime I talk to someone who has “lost a lot” in crypto, they are holding XRP. 

I assume that lack of understanding around supply/market cap was a huge factor. It looked “cheap” to people.

30 2018-08-26 23:56:55 Manipulation. IMF has said crypto is not a threat "yet". If/when that day comes, surely the US/IMF/Central Banks will use whatever amount of (minuscule) money necessary to crash the market. Gold & Silver has a strong history of gov. manipulation and ownership controls.
31 2018-08-26 23:56:54 No Crypto, I'm through with you...not gonna play...muting because you are wrong and not interesting enough.

Keep staying true to who you are.
Head up, positive thoughts, let no one get in the way of your dreams. Be a strong man for @MissCrazyCrypto, you guys will have an amazing life together.
