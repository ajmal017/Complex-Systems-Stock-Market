Prices of some essential commodities, including rice, have risen in 2017. Despite the increase in the per capita income in the country last year, it has not received any benefit of 12 million people of low and middle income!

68 2018-04-21 15:47:53 You are right it's the infighting in our entire country that troubles me. From oil and gas to wine and spirits. None of our commodities are immune to this stupidity. Stupidity of epic proportions never seen before. It's time for real change and for Canada to stand together as one
69 2018-04-21 15:33:09 Totally agree on energy, commodities. Also like telecom. I'm very concerned about tech and Fins in the immediate. If market can stabilize via rotation away from there we have a shot, but I think people are too stuck in their ways.  Prob need to see death of a darling to change
70 2018-04-21 15:28:58 I do not expect a crash in equity markets but there is always a chance.  That is why I like sectors that have already had a 2008 event...commodities and related industries.

73 2018-04-21 15:24:14 The cost of housing mortgages and rent is driving up other costs. All other businesses increase prices of commodities to pay for their housing! Of course there are other factors. #CorporateRentalParasitesDenver #TeacherWalkouts

76 2018-04-21 15:15:29 As their roster stands they’d need those picks as valuable commodities. I just don’t think their in a position to do so now for a coach.
77 2018-04-21 15:14:55 Im not bashing Pearson. Air travel freight are commodities. Blessed in Burlington ON with 5 airports to choose from.

80 2018-04-21 14:47:23 La suba o baja de retenciones en commodities significa linealmente baja o suba de precios a los que venden los productores.
Esas empresas ganan lo mismo por cada tonelada con 0 o con 90% de retenciones
81 2018-04-21 14:45:36 What else do you work on? Getting deals for your industrialist friends ?? Making the common indian suffer for basic commodities?
Sorry sir, you've failed 1.3 billion people. The population of India is not 600 crores as you keep saying btw
82 2018-04-21 14:45:02 I see this is the same kind of argument, attempting to pass something as a new asset class, and apply it has value in many fancy ways, but if it has no Trading, and nothing behind it, it's less valuable then land, gold/commodities, shares of stock, etc and a bad investment.
83 2018-04-21 14:44:09 This commercialised atomisation of thought and speech, sundering apart an organic whole into fungible commodities, is the antithesis to a true post-capitalist material basis of communication!
84 2018-04-21 14:24:49 And do you think the EU should simply take our word as to whether or not we are choosing to export commodities of inferior standard to the EU? Or should they be permitted to carry out checks?

86 2018-04-21 14:13:18 Respuestas y explicaciones simplistas quedan para la discusión en la micro o en el metro. Se requiere un esfuerzo mayor para entender porque a Chile se le hace difícil crecer solo viviendo de los commodities. Entiende?

88 2018-04-21 14:05:27 Primeira coisa é taxar as principais commodities de forma que fique invisível a compra pelo mercado externo. Exigir que a matéria prima seja manufatura aqui, melhorando nossa indústria e gerando mais empregos e recursos.

96 2018-04-21 13:00:02 Is the exclusive power of having recourse to them, agreeably to the proofs he had long planned against the abuse of their commodities.
97 2018-04-21 12:54:50 No amount of punishment,death penalty or whatever is going to change the situation on ground!!

Both are interested in EU not UK.  If you want a deal , try India: but then you will have to them let in ?

103 2018-04-21 12:30:18 This is what happens when you see people as commodities instead of human beings.
104 2018-04-21 12:23:34 @arunjaitley  Sir, i understand prices of commodities are goin up every odd day but then the price which is being told is inclusive of all the taxes including bill but the hospital has charged 800 more on rupees 16000 medicine for a proper bill. #Nishat #hospital #lucknow
105 2018-04-21 12:21:05 Los primeros son más imaginación que otra cosa. Nadie en el negocio de commodities llegó nunca a producir el 1% del total en ningún rubro. Y creo que 0,5% tampoco.
Donde hay jugadores grandes y concentrados es en los regionales (citrus por ejemplo). No es necesariamente malo.

122 2018-04-21 10:23:48 I think the Duterte administration must come up with price control mechanisms that would prevent the further rising of inflation on basic primary commodities by convening the Price Control Council formed under Republic Act No. 7581 as amended later by Republic Act No. 10623
123 2018-04-21 10:16:50 VC já ouviu falar no boom das commodities? VC sabia que o insignificante do FHC fez um empréstimo antes de sair di governo, aumentando a dívida externa, mas quem usou o dinheiro desse empréstimo foi o seu sucessor?

131 2018-04-21 09:11:28 Are there any other commodities that prices for both spot and long-term are published, other than #uranium?  Usually commodities are just spot and some fwd curves.  A decent fwd curve has been used/developed since the last price run up, by @numerco, for #Uranium.
132 2018-04-21 08:57:20 The same damage:
Had price of commodities affordable,
Didn't demarket Nigerians,
Didn't use public funds for family medicals,
Didn't set up bunch of miscreants to twist things and call plain white deep red,
Didn't encourage terrorism.

133 2018-04-21 08:55:59 Tem relação com o que então?
Commodities, petróleo, direita delirante...

135 2018-04-21 08:37:43 Weights and Measures Act read with Packages and Commodities Rules... allows one month leeway is what I recall.  That is you can date March production with April month but not later.
136 2018-04-21 08:34:01 Sir, then problem of rising price of petrol diesel and essential commodities, why not solved till now???
137 2018-04-21 07:55:34 The Pakistan blocked the supply of essentals into state in Shiekh Abdullahs tenture, thus putting kashmiris at the mercy of National Conference, those who were suspected of having any affiliation with the non-National Conference parties were denied the essential commodities.
138 2018-04-21 07:42:05 As commodities, we're far too cynical - I'm sure their intentions are entirely honourable 
139 2018-04-21 07:10:03 Can you reply to me with a 6 Lucky numbers that can bet in my place because i need to win Lottery for me to help with the Commodities of my parents please respond i will wait.
140 2018-04-21 07:07:19 Yes. I know. And we can send it frozen to the Middle East & ban live trade. We are harsh enough in the treatment of these animals we conveniently choose to call ‘commodities’ without subjecting them to the live export horrors.
141 2018-04-21 07:04:29 Very good graph! Psychology of the market is difficult to predict; boiling frogs to ketchup splash. If credit market is the trigger, rates over 3,5%, rising commodities and other inflation pressures will do. Just guessing it may take another year.
142 2018-04-21 07:01:26 That's why best way to play the news and don't over extend stay and don't get into long term investment zone with commodities

145 2018-04-21 06:27:53 we can make poor countries people prosperous by decreasing consumer prices or increasing income. Rich countries increase market prices of the commodities they supply in the international markets and take money from poor countries.
146 2018-04-21 06:22:16 My gr8est fear is that someday soon all the loan words in English will get revoked. Folks u can say good bye 2 shopping @ the Home Depot & hello to the Home Place for storage of large quantities of commodities #distopian
147 2018-04-21 05:59:43 @ANI  prices of all commodities increased by almost double for the last three years. Govt is sleeping.
148 2018-04-21 05:47:40 Bitcoin is a distributed ledger. Ledgers are not necessarily commodities but they are useful. The question is; "what is the value of an immutable scroll that doesn't need a human scribe."
149 2018-04-21 05:44:19 Minimum Support Price is a great step of @AgriGoI ensuring agriculture producers against any sharp fall in prices.. The MSP announce by Government of India on the basis of recommendations of #CACP Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices. GoI has given MSP for 23 commodities.
150 2018-04-21 05:38:28 Matt, as I tweeted earlier, it’s about making educators in schools know that PGCE students need to be treated with respect. They aren’t commodities you can just push through an interview system and ‘reject’ with a lack of care and consideration.
151 2018-04-21 05:25:50 The only thing that gives meaning to an otherwise meaningless life are stories we hear or tell ourselves, no? Travellers find meaning in their stories of travel, artists in stories of their art, programmers in their code, consumers in the stories of how good their commodities are
152 2018-04-21 05:18:06 Why not nationalise a resource or two and go back to free education/medical for all Ozzies>>>LNG/Lithium are just a couple of commodities that will help all Australians and ensure a good future for our kids<go on suggest that in parliament!!??
153 2018-04-21 05:14:25 Acá lo más barato, y por ende el mejor negocio, es destruir recursos para exportar commodities.

157 2018-04-21 04:42:33 On the contrary, engineering goods have become a larger component of our exports and the share of other non-traditional manufactured commodities is going up.
158 2018-04-21 04:35:40 Yes, the commodities downturn had a big impact. Key and National's stability was a good thing though, surely? The NBN in Australia continues to be delayed because the Libs don't want to give Labour a legacy project. Here we have UFB nationwide
159 2018-04-21 04:21:11 And all of them have value and should never be treated like commodities. We are all made of cells. If you're talking about a zygote, that is the beginning of human life. It's how your son's life started. You think you should've had the right to extinguish your son's life?
160 2018-04-21 04:09:52 Putz, a qualidade de “pensadores brasileiros” é sofrível. Não há outro caminho, desde 1500, a não ser comercializar com o mundo. A questão é ter eficiência pra competir e não só em commodities.

166 2018-04-21 03:25:02 As far as commodities go, as soon as China threatened tariffs on our commodities you had European buyers looking to pick up those commodities which forced China's hand.
167 2018-04-21 03:05:41 COMMODITIES WERE NOT ON TIME SO YOU SET YOUR ASSES DOWN WITH ADVERSARIES AND PLOTTED DEVASTATION...LOL LMFAO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'VE CREATED NON ANGLES PROTO ANCIENT SPEAKERS...LOL YOU PARAPHRASED YOURSELVES IN A BIND...LOL LMFAO SMACKKKKKKKK

169 2018-04-21 02:42:28 Here’s the deal - ain’t nobody here an international finance guru of commodities. Ain’t nobody knows about OPEC and oil price manipulation. Ain’t nobody talking politics. Everyone shut up and stop tweeting.
170 2018-04-21 02:41:13 Some math...gasoline prices are down $1.00/gallon from the 2012-13 levels, oh yeah and the 2008 levels too....that comes to a $500/savings per year for the average blah blah blah blah....

News flash:  commodities are cyclical.
171 2018-04-21 02:29:14 Whitewater, her shady commodities windfall, Vince Foster's 'suicide', Web Hubbell's humiliation, her Monica-bashing...the evidence has always been in plain sight what kind of person she is.  She IS a greedy, lying grifter.
172 2018-04-21 02:13:29 IMO it's the perfect format: great host and two experts that dont have to agree in deep dialogue rather than the std 4 minute format reg. implication to stks, bonds & currencies/PM of Libor rt, int rt, debt, GDP, yld curve, trd/cur wars, commodities.  These are interesting times!
173 2018-04-21 01:36:02 @narendramodi_in sir why you are not considering the reduction of excise duty on oil product which reduce the buying capacity of a common mans need of essential commodities for his survival.? since essential commodities prices are shot up by diesel price hike where it will leave
174 2018-04-21 01:26:21 This has always really pissed me off. 
-A raise in minimum wage is a quick way to force up inflation.  Thus not much help for those it should
 -Increases the tax on commodities and income tax. Win for GOV
-MIN wage was never living wage.  Ruining the learning for the young
ECT..
175 2018-04-21 01:19:14 i suppose there has always been an Uncivil Element in our Society that has felt Ignored (as it well should be). Unfortunately, that Element has gained access to the Highest Offices in our Gov't, rendering Stability & Civility rare & precious Commodities.
176 2018-04-21 01:07:33 I think it’s more cost effective and effective if the Republicans did the same. Just buy the votes. Forget preaching. Basically, the Elite Dems treat their constituents as commodities and not as people.  They just buy and sell their people to get power.
177 2018-04-21 01:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
178 2018-04-21 00:44:23 Well, only if those are the only eligible assets. Commodities? Inflation breakevens?

181 2018-04-21 00:16:55 Doesn't eliminate the issue for future series when tickets are hotter commodities in later rounds. They should refund unused games 100% like most venues. Instead they do this so at the end they can say "Trade unplayed games for Hens tickets!" which are worth $6 less. Dirty.
182 2018-04-21 00:13:06 We need more than an independent inspector general of animal welfare, we need to change Federal law that lists animals as commodities so they don't come under animal protection laws. Ban all live animal exports, you have my vote if you vote for Sussan Ley's private members bill.
183 2018-04-21 00:05:57 Controle propriamente não há, mas há como se adaptar prevendo um possível colapso. O que afeta o Brasil com uma crise mundial? Exportações de commodities. Como se precaver? Desenvolvendo a economia interna, ajustando as contas públicas, criando reservas

235 2018-04-22 20:56:32 What’s your problem? Again, these companies are developing zero emission technology. Again, look at your battery supply chains. Commodities are equal to fossils. Profit drives markets and pays bills. Everyone should have chance to change for better.

237 2018-04-22 20:50:21 We live in a society with ideologies that are steeped deeply in ego. Our ancestors used commodities as a display of wealth. We may no longer openly buy and sell humans but we shamelessly buy fine cheeses made from milk stolen from calves as a statement of wealth.  #shameless

245 2018-04-22 20:01:53 I get it - I work in International Trade & the logistics & planning that goes into moving commodities from one end of the globe to the other takes an immense trust in our Supply Chain Networks. I trust my partners but WE DO inevitably drop the ball @ times & EXPENSIVELY (1)
246 2018-04-22 19:52:32 justamente dije que las commodities explican lo electoral. el efecto de la corrupcion no es necesariamente electoral sino organizativo.

251 2018-04-22 19:29:05 Os donos do mundo se desentendem, Trump  pensou que seria o monarca  do globo, hoje, a Alemanha pede o fim das sanções á Rússia, entende que o mercado de commodities russo é mais atraente, se os Estados Unidos quiserem conquistar o mundo, terá que dar a moeda de troca.
252 2018-04-22 19:24:22 Não há mais condições de se manter a hegemonia norte americana, esta era feita a custo de conchavos, hoje, Trump quer agir unilateralmente, enquanto a Rússia oferece para a Europa um mercado de commodities, mundo vive a busca do multilateralismo e da geopolítica multipolar.
253 2018-04-22 19:23:45 Guns are a consumer goods, like a car, and consumers of these commodities should be required to buy insurance.
254 2018-04-22 19:18:55 Massive denial.Why bred them to existence then?Animals are their commodities,of course they have to taking care of their "WALLETS" those animals are eventually being murdered. carnivores only kill few animals in the wild, compared to human. we are killing 70 BILLIONS animals/year
255 2018-04-22 18:58:31 Law of supply and demand lives in commodities
256 2018-04-22 18:48:36 It's the problem of inflation and unemployment. The wage cost increase has to be recovered and that will be in the price of commodities like bread, milk, vegetables, transport, etc. And if employers can't recover the cost, then the business shuts and it's more unemployment.

259 2018-04-22 18:26:55 When the elite are literally(figuratively) swimming in money, what "commodities" or "goods" or "services" do they trade in?
Information/blackmail.  Abhorrent behaviors like Pedophilia and Cannabalism.  Opioids are beneath them, so they need more... exotic drugs; like adrenchrome.

263 2018-04-22 18:07:08 Yo creo que el factor central son los precios de las commodities para explicar lo electoral pero el impacto sobre el imaginario de izquierda de la corrupcion me parece importante--Odebretch era un proxy.

278 2018-04-22 16:23:45 Well, not to worry. We can take all that money we save on tax cuts and put it in the gas tank. All commodities are higher now too! So thanks for Dowling up the economy. Now when there is recession can't cut taxes. Did you REALLY attend Wharton?
279 2018-04-22 16:16:45 high and mighty rhetoric about not turning human bodies into commodities is both a great way to preclude France from surrogacy and an ingenius way to ignore sex work as an entire industry, nice work guys 
(spoiler: the human body has been a commodity since before Sargon of Akkad)
280 2018-04-22 16:03:43 There must be some more nuance than that. Slaves were commodities and sold and bought in other earlier systems too.

291 2018-04-22 15:04:53 Not all commodities are perishable. The reason you couldn’t dominate nations with wealth is because there simply wasn’t enough wealth.
292 2018-04-22 15:02:39 Rare commodities are worth more than good
293 2018-04-22 15:02:12 Guess who pays more for all those Commodities than the country that they are produced in
294 2018-04-22 15:01:28 good at making commodities that don't work or break down I lost my composure at the end of show.
295 2018-04-22 15:01:15 Wages are sticky in the short/medium term commodities arent so that is a factor as well.
296 2018-04-22 14:35:57 Fabrício, quem define o preço de commodities, como os minérios, petróleo, soja etc, é o mercado internacional, nas bolsas de valores, baseado na regra básica da demanda e oferta. Esse preço vale pra qualquer país produtor.
297 2018-04-22 14:30:03 I mean but if we didn’t mass produce animals, have a general mentality that they’re just commodities, and then give them to literally anyone who wanted one, this cat wouldn’t have been thrown out by ingrates in the first place
298 2018-04-22 14:29:59 Basically we turning into Japan, the globe is only so big, commodities hit lows and are bouncing back. I think the overall health is better, not sure that there will be another industrial rev type expansion until we have new things to expand since we have covered the expanse
299 2018-04-22 14:27:20 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
300 2018-04-22 14:24:51 i think it depends in which part of the country you've lived. i'm sure back home bigger cities got western commodities way faster than where i grew up
301 2018-04-22 14:16:02 Carne natural de URUGUAY deberíamos ir por el camino de carne a pasto y trabajar en marca para salir de los commodities.Lo imposible un poco más difícil Vamos !!
302 2018-04-22 14:13:46 Drugs do not relax you, they turn you into a consumptive addict who relies on commodities to remain socially functional.
303 2018-04-22 14:09:16 By generally it meant not favouring countries for historical or cultural reasons, but rather on the level of development and across a broad range of goods, rather than core agricultural commodities.
304 2018-04-22 14:02:05 I export Agro commodities to the Middle East
305 2018-04-22 14:00:44 I appreciate that they call attention to the complexity of bias in service industries, but standardizing scripts and treating everyone equally only works with low-stakes commodities (like coffee). If they need info about real services, equal is inequitable.
306 2018-04-22 13:58:32 Is happiness as a beach visitor for relax component sinking commodities from types of countries?

#Monetarystores
#Hotels
307 2018-04-22 13:54:27 Ha! The brand of WaW overlooks that many people do this approach already in all kinds of ways. But, you know, commodities...
308 2018-04-22 13:53:54 And most derivatives are pure speculation, bets, not hedges against risk of loss from owning securities or commodities.

The world's financial system is mostly a casino.

Why are tax payers expected to cover the losses if they get too bad?
309 2018-04-22 13:49:32 I honestly was thinking Settlers would be a good option since an important component is bargaining for commodities.
310 2018-04-22 13:47:37 Estamos bem no início do ciclo. Não tivemos ainda a entrada forte de estrangeiros. O risco eleitoral que muitos defendem é secundário. Já tivemos o mesmo Lula no seu 1o mandato eleito em um ciclo de subida das Commodities e vimos como se comportou o mercado.
311 2018-04-22 13:47:36 Y lo q dices del mayor ingreso per capita tienes toda la razon. El problema fue q se lo robaron todo tus idolos rojitos. Eso no le llego a nadie y d paso nada tuvo q ver con Chavez. Los altos precios de los commodities se debieron al gran desarrollo de China, la India entre otros
312 2018-04-22 13:46:01 Aliás, o câmbio só está onde está hoje, nos 3.40, por conta desse hedge eleitoral... se não fosse isso, 3.20 era o teto... vide DXY com franca tendência de queda, DOLx outras moedas, commodities em alta, etc...
313 2018-04-22 13:40:54 Con todo respeto. Confundís energía eléctrica con petróleo y gas y precios de commodities con tarifas. La producción de hidrocarburos baja por el precio internacional (conviene importar). Las tarifas estaban hipersubsidiadas. No mas que decir. Hay cientos de paises q importan.
314 2018-04-22 13:35:34 All agro commodity prices are at their most vulnerable during harvest as supply exceeds demand.  Commodities such f&v with their limited shelf life more so. 
That excess supply should shift to storage to limit fall. Farmers awareness & access to storage and financing is key.
315 2018-04-22 13:33:00 How does wanting a trade balance on finished goods & services, as Trump apparenty wants - constitute a trade war? Note, USA also has trade deficits with imports of mineral commodities.
316 2018-04-22 13:24:27 Nenhum foi igual aos outros. De 65 a 71 foi o período militar das grandes obras. E gerou a ressaca de 71 a 83. De 83 a 86 tivemos um das maiores secas em US o q fez commodities voar. De 86 a 91 foi uma draga q terminou no impeachment do Collor. Enfim, SEMPRE é diferente.
317 2018-04-22 13:21:16 Two commodities I'm currently keeping an eye on for the next year or two are #silver & #coffee. Silver has been coiling for over a year and coffee has historically low volatility which has always lead to a price explosion. Both are poised for big moves.
318 2018-04-22 13:20:01 +gold, diamonds and other commodities
319 2018-04-22 12:56:40 How can we re/distribute cryptocurrency without it being infected by some malware? If India is going to go into this huge change of currency exchange, how can they work with other currency in terms of travel or physical commodities from private merchants? Will the world follow?
320 2018-04-22 12:47:20 The cold utilitarianism of professionalism. Players are commodities to be pushed about the country, and like the coaches, have less autonomy than ever before.
321 2018-04-22 12:27:46 Economy of sahib —

Multiple bogus slab in GST 
Nirav Modi 
Mallaya
Lalit Modi 
110$ per barrel oil and gas price 400rs in UPA But 70$ per barrel 800rs for Gas cylinder and fuel prices also high which has inflated daily commodities to high in last 6 years.
322 2018-04-22 12:26:03 For me this really underscores how critical #biosecurity is for keeping foreign animal disease out. It makes me sad to see how careless people can be when returning to Canada, sneaking in agriculture commodities without any thought of the possible consequences.
323 2018-04-22 12:13:08 Sugar stocks like Balrampur bottoming out? Can cyclical essential commodities make money in multi month cycle?
324 2018-04-22 11:46:26 Great advice, thanks for sharing this story. Developing IP is increasingly important these days, I think. Crowded marketplaces can turn great products into commodities.
325 2018-04-22 11:41:07 Commodities volando y salario real en el piso. Agarro yo tmb...
326 2018-04-22 11:37:19 I’m worried about Hero.  When does he/she get to toilet, walk etc. I hate seeing dogs used as handbags or commodities. So bloody sad.  #SN7
327 2018-04-22 11:36:33 We need to obtain nuclear weapons and then the world can go fuck itself, relying on them has nearly killed us. Africa will always buy our food and everywhere will still want our commodities.
328 2018-04-22 11:33:24 Es otro ejemplo de marca. En este caso, una marca ligada a una zona geográfica. Así funcionan las denominaciones de origen, el consumidor compra por inercia producto de esa zona porque lo relaciona con una calidad reconocida. Si no haces nada de eso, vendes commodities
329 2018-04-22 11:20:03 I think we would still be in barter trade shit,so we would still have to get those commodities for exchange,therefore the struggle is still there.

331 2018-04-22 10:29:12 At least those on ebay are generally working for themselves. Yes, I agree. No profits are worth treating people like commodities. I've heard the areas levels are through the roof. Feel so bad for the staff because jobs are so hard to find they feel compelled to stay!
332 2018-04-22 10:28:33 We all live with an inherently capitalistic mindset. We never go to a shopping mall and argue about the price of commodities but argue for hours with a street vendor even for 10 rupees. One is seen as classless and the other as smart.
333 2018-04-22 10:14:19 "If they want to start treating children like they're frigging commodities we should call them out for what they DO."

"we are humanity

Trade forces us to interact with other people."
334 2018-04-22 10:03:47 The ASX is poised to open in the red tomorrow after a 200 point drop on the Dow last Friday. Tech stocks seem to be under pressure whilst commodities continue to shine.
335 2018-04-22 09:55:29 What the fuck is wrong with those humans who bang on about the love for their pets while at the same time totally discounting the torture of sheep/cows/goats/donkeys/chickens etc etc cop 'cos they're "livestock" & "commodities". What sorta sociopath makes that distinction?
336 2018-04-22 09:49:39 Já quebrou. Não existe mais outro caminho. Reforma da previdência não é mais uma opção para 2019. Todos os pré-candidatos já falam disso abertamente. Sugiro focar no que poderá acontecer com o câmbio e commodities.
337 2018-04-22 09:46:06 Timing involves chart studies provide preliminary data inputs on just not stocks  but currency, commodities and overall all stats. That much time is just adequate. Anyhting more, it wd be over doing TA.
338 2018-04-22 09:38:29 They don't own the market of those commodities. They are not in good books with owners of the market. The system is designed to make your commodities useless if you don't accord the masters the primary exploitation. Yours is hangouts, failure to do that u will be embargoed
339 2018-04-22 09:34:16 Capital is money, capital is commodities. By virtue of it being value, it has acquired the occult ability to add value to itself. It brings forth living offspring, or, at the least, lays golden eggs....
340 2018-04-22 09:22:38 Cómo se combate a un Ceo Estado, donde lo mejor en propaganda y marketing creador de conciencia, actúa sobre la población 24/7, cómo se revela contra el q te provee de commodities, si el cuerpo depende de ellos.
 Lograron unir el monopolio estatal y ceocratico. hueso duro de roer
341 2018-04-22 09:02:50 1) Agreed. But - all about timing/chronology - what/when/where? Imo - yields will spike - and equities will drop hard, USD soar and hence commodities drop. Timeframe is now until End-2018.  This is the deflationary part of the decline.
342 2018-04-22 08:57:08 Peaceful as in DEATH to our country men by raising prices of prime commodities, drown them loans, unsolved crime, degrading poor and women. Pakyu.
343 2018-04-22 08:46:16 (1) One thing I am still wondering is how commodities would react to strongly rising yields... historically you could think up, but if usd rises (very likely) and equities are sharply down, then it could well be down. I still think that UST will see be seen as safe heaven assets
344 2018-04-22 08:44:13 So price of  petrol, diesel, essential commodities, unemployment increasing day by day. As Chaukidaar sleeping and looters looting billions of public money and runaway from country.
345 2018-04-22 08:22:28 Google is your friend. From taxes to toxic dumping, commodities to lobbyist contributions, the crime bill, etc, etc.
346 2018-04-22 08:18:42 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
347 2018-04-22 08:08:17 I dont believe some1 could be that retarded. Most ppl are trading crypto to make more money to move into equities markets. Equities make money. Crypto is a commodities market - they are different beasts.
348 2018-04-22 08:06:26 You’re so close to seeing the problem. Now think back to thousands of years ago. You couldn’t hold onto these commodities without them going bad. You couldn’t dominate entire nations with your wealth.
349 2018-04-22 07:55:06 Thank you. 
1. Agriculture: Niger has no excuse to not be among the highest producers of commodities like rice.
2. Sports and youth development: Completing the abandoned stadium project would have been a huge boost.
3.Tourism, this area now seems to have gone to  completely.
350 2018-04-22 07:53:16 So much congrats to NAEB to increase exports quantity and commodities.
351 2018-04-22 07:50:41 NZD and AUD are much more reliant on commodities so it doesn't make sense to interfere with money printing as it is hard to compensate commodity cycles anyway. US, Europe and Japan really work hard to support the fiat currencies.
352 2018-04-22 07:41:15 I know that silks dyed in the purple could buy entire cities. Economies back when where weird. Antiquity didn’t really have commodities.
353 2018-04-22 07:39:06 Hi，Dear friend, Could you help me? would you  please help me advertise my commodities? Thank you. I hope you will assent my request. Good days!
354 2018-04-22 07:20:49 This kasam is to destroy the India. It is seen that within 4 years no development, increase in prices of all commodities, destroy of economy, banking system, no creation of jobs etc. Rethink about your kasam.
355 2018-04-22 07:18:15 E que se juntará aos problemas atuais da Argentina e que já começam a atingir também o RS.  Vamos ter uma subida dos processos dessas commodities, se bem que o mercado mundial tem bom estoque regulador por enquanto.

That said, QT has a consistently better drink bar and roller grill, and better selection of basic commodities like milk and bread. OC has better gas, fro yo, and cups...who wants a sweaty plastic cup in OK?

375 2018-04-22 02:43:11 Encouragement to farming has always  done , but Agri-exports gives less value to the exporters as compared to other commodities, hence ppl moved from agri to other business, this is the reason why we face shortage in some commodities nowadays.

435 2018-04-20 20:41:51 Do you know about the commodities market? Maybe you should Google it.
436 2018-04-20 20:31:10 You're welcome to continue selling ALL of your commodities through Port access, but not to greatly increase oil shipments for the sake of turning a quick buck selling oil to Asia. This isn`t the safe harbor for that activity.
437 2018-04-20 20:31:02 No? Most other currencies and commodities are priced in USD anyhow. And those Middle Eastern countries trade in USD because there’s a sizable consumer base within the US/ it’s the cleanest currency in the “dirty laundry”.

458 2018-04-20 18:50:07 The market will reduce the price of oil  by itself without any government intervention . As prices move higher more suppliers will enter the market . An increased supply will help the price to go down .other commodities are also going up in price . Inflation drives up prices.

488 2018-04-20 17:08:21 The market has been in a commodities denial for a long time. Remember the Florida and Texas hurricanes when energy moves just temporary and due to the weather.

490 2018-04-20 16:53:56 The Passion of Joan of Arc was a true accomplishment of the early days of French, and world, cinema.

493 2018-04-20 16:48:36 Those commodities would have a much different impact, tumbling into the ocean than 650 000 barrels of oil. This is about increasing oil patch production for the purpose of exporting oil half way across the planet to Asia at significant risk.

634 2018-04-20 08:11:53 While technically there will always be sales in some form the term 'sales' generally refers to commodities ie financial products.

649 2018-04-20 05:55:30 Indeed. ASICs as commodities are truly excellent for any $crypto project. But to be commodities there has to be healthy competition among multiple manufacturers and *plenty* of supply for everyone. Constrained supply, or a dominant manufacturer, lead to centralization.

674 2018-04-20 03:19:33 I kinda like a lot of what I am seeing a cross the board in commodities in general, so it's been a good look.  It's just where do you want to invest your capital.  So far, miners is where the money is...I'll transition that to metals when it makes sense.  Looks great though.
