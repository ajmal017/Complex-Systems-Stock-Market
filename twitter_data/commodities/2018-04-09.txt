9 2018-04-09 23:20:23 I will admit that the idea that policy-makers should rewind 50 years of macro-economic arrangements, and return to a system where surplus and deficits are settled through some sort of barter exchange in commodities of rapidly declining relevance, is in a weird way .... novel

40 2018-04-09 22:23:49 Feminist objections to prostitution do not come from the concept that sex is degrading, they come from objecting to women's bodies being seen as purchasable fuckable commodities.
41 2018-04-09 22:19:16 A cow and calf are business commodities, again, the two aren't comparable.

45 2018-04-09 21:55:41 El problema es que gracias a los Tratados de Libre Comercio, que Colombia ha firmado con muchos otros paises, estos nos han puesto en la posición de compradores de bienes con valor agregado y como proveedores de commodities en el mercado global...

47 2018-04-09 21:44:29 The assumption that the only problem people have with "sex work" is a discomfort with sex really gets at the root of the whole problem with pro-prostitution argument: the notion that sex is a service women provide, that women's bodies are commodities

56 2018-04-09 20:26:56 Commodities will shine again. The big question is would that be a quick short covering rally, or a sustainable months long uptrend.
57 2018-04-09 20:20:57 Isn't the concept of supply and demand something that capitalists relish?
If so then why hasn't there been a huge impetus to build thousands of new homes?

I mean we seem to have an abundance of most other commodities.

58 2018-04-09 20:19:34 Is it offset on other commodities or services?

64 2018-04-09 19:57:57 Markets adopted a more positive stance towards US equities overnight, the S&P500 up 1.5%. The US dollar fell, while commodities are mostly higher. There was no obvious news catalyst, apart from Kudlow’s repeated soothing comments on trade issues.

66 2018-04-09 19:43:57 No No! There's no such thing as a stupid farmer. Most have advanced degrees in Agriculture and Horticulture, and if not them, their adult children do.

69 2018-04-09 19:35:36 Acho q a moeda brasileira e as commodities, nesse caso específico, a correlação positiva se justifica. Esse não é o caso de ser espúria. Mas correlação não quer dizer de jeito nenhum q tem q andar juntinho todo dia tick a tick, pode descasar tranquilamente.
70 2018-04-09 19:19:39 I don't want to criminalize those in prostitution. I want to criminalize those who sell humans for their own personal gain, and those who buy humans because of their misogynistic view that our bodies are commodities that can be exploited. Especially b/c most are women of color.
71 2018-04-09 19:14:54 You recognize that is is a "result of capitalism"? All of prostitution is the result of men viewing women as commodities and them having power that they abuse. That's a pathetic statement.
72 2018-04-09 19:11:03 @timseymour If China is not buying Treasuries anymore-- commodities will soar-- GIDDY UP!!
73 2018-04-09 19:09:08 the central banks around the world loan money to the "#TooBigToFail" banks around the world to make stock Bond & commodities "Markets" do whatever they want ... it's a fraudulent mis-representation to even call them "markets" any more ... the Problem?? they can NEVER GET OUT!!
74 2018-04-09 19:03:43 There seems to be some love for the precious metals even though markets are rising meaning that there are still concerns about a market decline.

78 2018-04-09 18:50:54 See my reply. This about economic systems, not asset classes. The way commodities exist within the current economic paradigm falls completely within our understanding of how micro and macro economies work. I don’t believe blockchains and cryptoassets do.
79 2018-04-09 18:48:26 If we're truly heading for a world collapse then silver and gold will be our safe havens. You can trade crypto to commodities with this new exchange that will have their ico soon. @digitalticks

82 2018-04-09 18:40:27 Makes sense to stay the course for gold (and other precious metals), as geopolitical risk is still persistent @EconGlobal #gold #Commodities #markets #trade #metals

90 2018-04-09 18:07:10 Surely the currency itself is not the issue but its susceptibility to market fluctuations. Any and all currencies - or commodities- behave in exactly the same way. The weakness of the £ is more to do with uncertainty around Brexit. Cause and effect

94 2018-04-09 17:55:07 Sim, o Brasil cresceu bastante no governo Lula. Mas imagine como teria crescido ainda mais e de forma mais saudável se o "boom das commodities" tivesse caído no colo de um presidente – ou mesmo grupo político – decente e responsável.

105 2018-04-09 17:15:13 Is anybody else listening to the conversation about how "futures have collapsed" for farm commodities on @TeamCavuto? Holy smokes... hogs and cattle, sure... okay. But grains and beans?
106 2018-04-09 17:14:04 this suggests that you agree with Trump's policy that invoked retaliation tariffs on Soybeans and other Ag commodities.   Doesn't surprise me.   @SteveKingIA told his constituents that this is just a painful chapter for farmers.   I disagree, Farmers shouldn't be hurt by you.
107 2018-04-09 17:12:43 Commodities need insurance and futures. Got nothing to do with credit rating.
108 2018-04-09 17:09:53 Yeah, we shouldn't commoditize food.

What's that? Staple foods like wheat, corn, etc. are literal commodities. Oh, never mind.
109 2018-04-09 17:09:42 Enjoy Recession 2019 you've brought on all of us, Trump fanatics, kindergarten thinkers, and closet rascists. Oh, and good luck with those commodities prices, Trump farmers.
110 2018-04-09 16:59:20 SlokaMeans one should not worry on matters  that should not be worried.People with intelligence wisdom  will not think about impractical matters.

111 2018-04-09 16:58:58 to over 80 mmt shows the susceptibility of the black sea. A more convincing headline perhaps than an easily discounted opinion on ksa imports. Any threat to the bosphorus means russia/ukraine can only rely on baltic ports for their exports of commodities aside from a small pctage
112 2018-04-09 16:56:31 i'll be doing commodities timing stuff about same time on my end as well - will be fun indeed ;D
113 2018-04-09 16:48:06 Largely true about individual stocks, but not indices and commodities, especially multi-month momentum. Very hard to arb away. The catch that sustains it is FOMO - momentum strategies often lag the market in a strong uptrend.
114 2018-04-09 16:23:55 Dr. Bamba el 2009, año de su gobierno sólo subió 1%, y en promedio el Perú creció 6.9% por el aumento sostenido del precio de los commodities. Ud. podia irse a dormir y creciamos igual o más.
115 2018-04-09 16:16:39 It’s just like highways and railroads. Some pipelines are even bi-directional, and can transport different commodities on the same system. Pipelines transport propane, ethylene, butane, light oil, heavy oil, jet fuel, gasoline, water, natural gas and even beer (in Europe).

129 2018-04-09 15:56:03 I love the idea of investing in commodities. Sad thing is I know zero about the mechanics.

133 2018-04-09 15:49:21 You keep believing that BCers are commodities that can be used as collateral damage just so that your company can profit, that's sick and sociopathy.
134 2018-04-09 15:39:13 Thank you very much.  I am looking at the ways in which we represent valuable commodities impact ideas about our own identity, and the way historical changes in societal structure like the shift from marekting-for-professionals to direct-to-consumer-advertising impact ideas
135 2018-04-09 15:30:19 No - they are & have been buying commodities w/ commodities trading at 100-yr lows relative to financial assets...as fiscal strain builds that will mathematically require Fed monetization of US deficits on an investable time horizon.

138 2018-04-09 15:28:02 @realDonaldTrump Michael Gates- Mr. President the media keeps carrying on about trade with China. Don't we sell all of these commodities and other items to other countries? I hope China is not our only country to sell them to? What about India, Brazil, South American countries?
139 2018-04-09 15:27:34 Sure. Harper had $120 oil. Trudeau inherited a commodities crash. Back then, the US still needed our oil, they've moved drastically toward energy independence since then. Many projects now uneconomic.  Reaching new markets is much greater challenge, that's where Harper failed.

163 2018-04-09 14:43:23 Greg, yes gold and silver may only be up a little on a weaker dollar. Look at other commodities like oil where there is strong demand.  It is way up today.  The world is burning oil everyday.  Gold is nice to have because it is shiny and pretty.

165 2018-04-09 14:39:55 Okay, then do smart trade. If China charges 2.5% tariffs, match that 2.5% tariff. 25% is excessive and will only hurt US consumers with higher prices, especially if China charges 25% on food commodities. Midwestern devastation. STUPID!!

You did say fair trade, right?
166 2018-04-09 14:39:19 China is going to start selling US treasuries if President Trump continues the tarriffs/trade war. When that happens the dollar will take a nosedive and commodities will skyrocket
167 2018-04-09 14:38:20 Tariffs on China are the best thing to happen, i.e. if only Trump follows through what he says he will do. Chinese companies steal technology, force IP transfer, dump goods and commodities at cheap prices using slave labour. Every country has turned a blind eye towards them.
168 2018-04-09 14:23:35 So the Yuan is convertible under the gold and oil contracts. Other commodities not yet. We know that Russia and Iran are on aboard. African nations next most likely. Becomes a question of time. 5-10 years?

"A commodity is something that is made in order to be sold" So yes, you ware exactly wrong. Your personal definition excludes things that are commodities by both the common and professional definition of the word.

242 2018-04-09 06:51:22 The only common denominator I have found to money is consensus. Money is whatever people agree is money. Rocks, debt, commodities, shells, beads... the list goes on. #bitcoin just says, "lets form a consensus through algorithm". A big factor, I think gets overlooked.

244 2018-04-09 06:34:22 The most prominent examples of financial collapse are caused by some combination of owing debt in foreign currencies or scarce commodities, having a fixed rate of exchange, or a loss of productive capacity, none of which are relevant to the U.S.
245 2018-04-09 06:27:20 Benefits of online commodity trading
Online screen based futures trading in about 85 commodities.
246 2018-04-09 06:26:19 Using Commodity trading to your advantage
Trading commodities enables you to participate in broad market moves or within specialized sectors.
247 2018-04-09 06:24:16 Commodities have now emerged as a separate asset class, helping investors to diversify their portfolios.
248 2018-04-09 06:23:54 having reach all over the country and dealing in almost all commodities, trading has exploded.
249 2018-04-09 06:23:26 In India, Commodities trading began with cotton in 1845.
250 2018-04-09 06:16:46 When there is a sharp decline in the #ConferenceBoard's #IndexLeadingEconomicIndicators and the fall is #divergent from data previously provided by other #indicators, the #markets may suddenly dump #stocks, #commodities, and #currencies, and chase after #bonds.
251 2018-04-09 06:12:39 I think if you believe that Kim is going to demolish his nukes then you should believe in the tooth fairy. He is desperate for commodities and will promise whatever he has to, when be gets what he wants then world beware.
252 2018-04-09 06:08:17 .issue I have is how it's tracking on black biz participation and/or development on core commodities. how much of ABB/ Siemens commissioned products will be fully manufactured by black entrepreneurs? Don't even start with BCX, yhuuuuuuuuu I'll ping offline about that one.
253 2018-04-09 05:53:06 @weahofficial Congratulations for your recent state visits to Cote I'voire and Republic of Ghana. Both countries are strong agricultural producing  nations with products like cocoa, coffee and oil palm as major export commodities on the world market.  Liberia can achieve the same
254 2018-04-09 05:35:17 .take an Eskom, with its business & operational plans across all divisions for the next 3 to 5 years, which commodities at how much do they forecast to procure directly from black MSMEs year on year?
255 2018-04-09 05:21:37 Same lane. They had 3 proven commodities in that one, at least. I wasn’t expecting shit out of Nia/Alexa lmao
256 2018-04-09 05:21:11 #isupportcrypto because it’s a revolution..Also it is the future of  internet if we ban it we will surely left behind. We have a good example of countries like U.S , canada, japan and Australia which are treating crypto as commodities #PMOIndia #ArunJaitley
257 2018-04-09 05:17:46 most valuable commodities: time & energy. be conscious of how you spend both
258 2018-04-09 05:17:22 Although #food and #energy are obviously important, traders, economists, etc. leave them out of #CoreCPI because food and energy are volatile due to people's varying habits, seasons, weather, and fluctuations in #prices of #commodities.

Outside of Albermarle there’s just not much lithium production in the US

266 2018-04-09 04:21:49 Not only that; some of China's loans to developing countries are backed by commodities. For example, Ecuador is repaying their debt in oil.
267 2018-04-09 04:11:38 Not only pepper, many commodities facing similar, if not same, situation. Sugar, chana, etc facing the heat.
268 2018-04-09 04:02:25 Commodities in focus

Steel up 5%
Coking Coal & Coke 4% up each

China’s overall steel stockpiles declined by 1.17MT last week compared to a week earlier to 16.8MT, the biggest 1-week drop since late 2013.

269 2018-04-09 03:58:00 The Coalition has managed the economy through a transition away from being solely commodities-reliant. Debt is largely due to Labor and the Senate not supporting spending initiatives put up by the government. There are 300,000 new jobs every year under this government.
270 2018-04-09 03:54:33 Yup, trade the price. 

It's interesting and somewhat remarkable that we have ranges in stocks, forex, and commodities with all this noise at the moment. 

Markets are remarkably sanguine even if the S&P is down 10% from the high

USD and Stocks could roar if we avoid a real mess

275 2018-04-09 03:38:34 Yes a complete ban for bloody good reason. It’s cruel, you clearly don’t care about the pain,illness and terror of the ‘commodities’ but you’re in the minority (or a beneficiary of this barbaric practice)And no I’m not vegan and I’m from a sheep/cattle family.
276 2018-04-09 03:35:09 Kailan napakataas ng inflation?

Sagot: Sa panahon ni Digonggong. 

Meaning: less purchasing power against increasing price of commodities.

283 2018-04-09 03:04:13 . @DavidADickey could maybe help with this but spoke to commodities director at @ILFarmBureau today who said that regardless of any federal aid , existing or created, to help offset fallout from China tariffs, farmers want trade not aid.
284 2018-04-09 02:52:27 This is what I’m talking about. We already assess anti dumping duties (ADD) for dumping and countervailing duties (CVD) for commodities that receive government subsidies. Tariffs will achieve very little in the short term except create inflation in the US as (1)

287 2018-04-09 02:42:23 No you bloody don’t. I come from a farming community and not one farmer agrees with the prolonged cruelty that is live trade. They’re clever enough to earn money from their ‘commodities’ without torturing them for weeks on end & knowing they might die drowning in their own shit.
288 2018-04-09 02:39:42 Se não me engano no começo da década de 80  teve algum descasamento tbem. A inflação veio e amenizou antes da recessão. Mas parece mais exceção à regra do q algo q coloque em cheque a relação entre commodities-inflação-recessão.
289 2018-04-09 02:39:02 The way to make a small fortune in the commodities market is to start with a large fortune. ��
290 2018-04-09 02:27:21 Sempre. O próprio overshooting das commodities causa o capote nas economias desenvolvidas. Commodites é custo pro mundo desenvolvido. Qdo o crescimento nos mercados desenvolvidos desaceleram e depois param de vez, no mercados emergentes ainda continua por um tempo adicional.
291 2018-04-09 02:11:29 Las condiciones que dieron prosperidad a Brasil fueron las exportaciones con commodities altísimas como fue la soja y el resto de las materias primas exportables. Los gobiernos pueden crear condiciones para atraer inversiones.

Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are influenced by opinions when you reach DECISIONS, you will not succeed in any undertaking.
294 2018-04-09 02:06:10 Tweetchats= scene on the commodities floor in Trading Places- a non-stop flurry of activity where you know you are missing things but you're trying to keep up with the main traffic. After the final bell rings there's a trickle of activity to clean up loose ends. :) #obsm
295 2018-04-09 02:05:17 Más que aprovechar debemos producir tecnología en el área agrícola, turismo, commodities. Hacer acá y dejar de lado el mediocre dicho importa sale mas económico.
296 2018-04-09 02:04:49 but but the entire world will crash if i don’t partake in m-c-m or c-m-c, how will the world keep spinning without commodities, money and capital
297 2018-04-09 01:59:43 Makes me think of Roger Angell's description of Yankee fans acting like wealthy stock-holders and treating the players like blue chip commodities.
298 2018-04-09 01:30:35 The entire soybean issue is stupidity by people who don't understand commodities.  Commodities are fungible so China putting tariffs on US soy will have negligible effect.  If Brazil now sells more to China the US will then sell to markets previously supplied by Brazil.  Big deal
299 2018-04-09 01:28:04 Ya girl.... Just been watching it waiting for this along with other commodities to get going
300 2018-04-09 01:26:08 Brasil supo aprovechar la gran época de los commodities, industrializó y puso en marcha una política más liberal con el discurso de izquierda, igual despúes les gustó la guita, acá se la llevaron toda, 3 veces el valor del dpto de Lula tenía el tucán en una caja de seguridad
301 2018-04-09 01:23:48 I think the intent behind disallowing capital assets or commodities would be to prevent the answer of "use the money to make more money", so investment for financial gain might be similar. Is there such a thing as investing for pleasure (family friend, maybe)?

304 2018-04-09 01:05:26 When you support the #objectification of women by literally making them into sexual #commodities, how can anyone possibly be surprised by people like @HarveyWeinstein & their ilk following these cues? Cake, or eat it.
305 2018-04-09 01:02:56 Right? We're ALL commodities in a capitalist world.

It became obvious when they changed the department name from "Personel" to "Human Resources."

Because now humans are equivalent to inanimate objects.
306 2018-04-09 00:47:44 Anybody concerned about the shitloads o' $$$ trumps' kiddies and cronies are making as donnie manipulates the stock and future commodities markets with his insane chinese tariff shell game?
307 2018-04-09 00:38:34 Either market signals or sector strategy will ultimately drive change.  Farming has a long history without PK and indications are could transition off it in 18 months. Agree, could and should the manufacturing industry do the same? Commodities vs premium product discussion...
308 2018-04-09 00:34:26 The £ is back to pre vote levels against the $ which most commodities are price in,inflation is predicted to fall back to 2%,manufacturing, exports,inward investment & employment at record highs these aren't indicators of disaster but we need to implement a true brexit to succeed
