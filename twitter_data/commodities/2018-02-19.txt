35 2018-02-19 22:32:59 Any country that sells commodities to other countries and accepts payments from the buyers in other currency than dollars would be breaching Nixon Shock 1971 agreement signed by the nations which replaced the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement..!
36 2018-02-19 22:27:51 Futures and commodities added to the portfolio, check.
37 2018-02-19 22:27:02 Yes. Au was "commodified" via paper derivatives. Au's not, after all, a genuine commodity, at least as I define commodities: raw materials, (i.e. lumber, cotton, oil, wheat, meat, etc.) that are economically essential to day to day life.
38 2018-02-19 22:25:16 Did you read Polanyi’s Great Transformation on the damaging results of treating labor and land as commodities? (When they aren’t, really)
39 2018-02-19 22:24:19 Hell commodities markets and prices set what is developed we say investments are scams “100% lies” Collectively  One Nation under God means our planet earth can start over again from Zero; the  is not teleportation
40 2018-02-19 22:11:34 Just for clarification, the pinning to other commodities is because of paper. Without paper the flow to stock ratio will be the differentiator?
41 2018-02-19 22:11:29 Monday night calls soybeans up 5 to 10, corn up 1 to 2 , wheat up 2 to 3 cents, Uscommodities is in Paraguay having flown over Argentina over the weekendA dry pattern persist. Yields are suffering.Local forecast are dry for the next 10 days, temps forecast  90 to 97 trends are up
42 2018-02-19 22:07:27 Nope.  IMO gold wont be main reserve either.  Once oil/commodities are priced/settled in multiple currencies, need for reserve assets (read: UST's) falls dramatically globally (China imports ~$1T/yr in commodities for example.)  As that happens, US gov't has an acute BoP problem
43 2018-02-19 21:44:28 In case that wasn’t clear enough, commodities that are reflexively correlated with gold through the paper markets will no longer be correlated. The term precious metals will be seen to be specious as silver remains earthbound while Au goes stratospheric.

54 2018-02-19 20:29:45 When the paper market goes belly up physical will require revaluation to get it out of hiding. The absence of a paper market makes it possible to pin gold pretty much anywhere “the market” chooses since paper is what tethers gold to commodities.
55 2018-02-19 20:25:16 But even then surely a big box store can't compete on commodities like Legos which can more conveniently be purchased online, or even at Walmart for probably less. It's way more about retail consolidation than kids being spoiled with tablets.

There are a few areas where they work, but even those need heavy regulation.
64 2018-02-19 19:13:57 Smaller doable reforms like not requiring jute bags, doing away with limited licenses in APMCs, and allowing imports and exports of all commodities without constantly messing with rates and MEPs will allow farmers to function as entrepreneurs.
65 2018-02-19 19:06:29 The newest bills being pushed by BLM is the slaughtering of Wild horses to make meat commodities for the poor. These are wild indigenous mustangs that @SecretaryZinke wants to kill off to make grazing room for the cattle industry on public lands! Goodbye to the western icon!
66 2018-02-19 19:01:10 I guess this brings up the concept of humans as commodities, separated into low, middle, high, premium, etc grades for various purposes...  :-O
67 2018-02-19 19:00:25 I volunteer at a food pantry and clothes closet. Families in need can come get clothing free every week. They can get commodities and emergency food monthly.
68 2018-02-19 18:59:00 Yes, but we have government programs to address every scenario. Chip, Medicaid, snap, free school lunches, commodities, even dental for children.
69 2018-02-19 18:58:51 One is telling humans what to do with their own body. The other is telling them what commodities they can buy. Different degrees of personal choice, freedom (to me).
70 2018-02-19 18:58:07 When we watch Gold or other commodities, or the stock market go up & down, do they realize "money's" doing it, too?

Big cash unaffected by taxes, transportation and commodities are all included, and if ya prove yourself good ya may get to work among the high spheres of the country. About the targets... Let's hope we won't find ourselves in that situation anytime soon.
75 2018-02-19 18:34:06 are you talking about getting something because of your situation? no sure but playing the victim all the time seems to be a trend of the left, personally I do what I know I have to and continue to surge forward and no one has ever given me anything like commodities.
76 2018-02-19 18:28:14 The “bitcoin” is not a coin; it is a speculative commodity. Its wide, short-term fluctuations are not based on actual swings in values by other commodities, but on its own fluctuations in value. This makes it wholly unsuitable as a medium of exchange. Hence, it is not a currency.
77 2018-02-19 18:13:26 Someone finally figured out what the REAL commodities are.  LIFE is what everyone will spend their last penny for.

84 2018-02-19 17:44:43 It also looks at the macro side; the most effective policies to be considered as consumer/supplier behaviour is being observed. There's also an understanding of sectors i.e. how health care should not be treated the same way as other 'economic commodities'
85 2018-02-19 17:38:47 As someone that does both...yes. Cryptos > currencies/commodities >>>>>>>>> stocks/bonds for TA.  One day cryptos won’t be that way, but that’s not due to earnings but rather market inefficiencies (or emotions). Also TA here is somewhat self fulfilling

97 2018-02-19 16:44:18 You know our brilliant gov't has ban "commodities" before as a "solution" to a social problem. For example prohibition (alcohol) which was to solve men not going home to their wives etc. Later war on drugs. No body can get drugs anywhere in US. These worked like a charm. RIGHT?

99 2018-02-19 16:42:06 I agree we need to protect our kids and so they feel safe. Like banks, businesses and sports stadiums let’s put metal detectors at all schools and guards to protect our most cherished commodities. If banks have it for money, and CEO’s for their businesses why should schools.

233 2018-02-19 01:29:11 If we ban these guns and these mags then people will see them as valuable commodities. Those who already have an AR 15 will literally be up in arms over a ban or a mandatory buyback program. My final opinion is that we should not infringe the rights of law abiding citizens.
