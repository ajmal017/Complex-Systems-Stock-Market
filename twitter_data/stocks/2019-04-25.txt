0 2019-04-25 23:59:42 We need to do some major organized #BoycottTwitter. Everybody go dark together, drop their stocks or something! I'm sick of Twitter just letting conservatives spread lies and spread hate.
1 2019-04-25 23:59:01 If your hard work is what caused tech compensation to increase by 1.5x from 2011 to now, then I owe you a beer.

If you're saying that you correctly predicted this would happen, you could've made a lot more money with less effort by taking on a ton of debt and buying tech stocks.
2 2019-04-25 23:58:20 Groupon, Tesla, Lyft, Eventbrite, Spotify - how many public stocks are gonna go sideways before investors realize private equity subsidies are not a sustainable business model?

Up next: Uber, Compass.
3 2019-04-25 23:56:18 I only deal with stocks 10 and below anyway. Tesla good though
4 2019-04-25 23:55:05 I actually have my savings in portfolio split between 70% stocks and 30% bonds. Earn a better return on my money(7-8%) vs 2.2%.  I don’t mind taking a little bit of risks. I’ve have success on it so far
5 2019-04-25 23:54:34 Yesterday - Industry: #SOFTWARE & SERVICES was 15% Positive, with #NOT APPLIC 7% Positive. Stocks: $VEC was 18% Positive, with $SPX 9% Positive. #ASX
6 2019-04-25 23:53:05 Just a general comment on these stocks. Second Tom, your DD is on point!
7 2019-04-25 23:50:55 But always stock out. You don't have enough stocks as per user demand.
8 2019-04-25 23:49:48 It's been an incredible week for tech stocks.
9 2019-04-25 23:49:41 Stocks are not economy. Stocks up because the rich 1% got that big ole tax break. Instead of giving workers raises or expanding, most did stock buybacks & gave the executives bonuses,  who, in turn, are buying stocks. There isn't a big rebooting of coal,mfg. farms dairies hurting
10 2019-04-25 23:49:01 ALPDAQ stocks are standing at a high time low. At this time we are encouraging shareholders to grate their stocks in their boiled patato dinner for a pinch of spice.
11 2019-04-25 23:48:17 Loading penny stocks
12 2019-04-25 23:46:11 It's crazy. Most of the tech stocks I traded in late 90s early 2000s aren't even around anymore.
13 2019-04-25 23:45:43 It's hard to believe that talk, the FED wants the access to the Stock Markets. If they didn't do it with the easy way (Legislation, Congress), they will do it with the hard way (Crisis and Stocks tumble)... the view will be clear in June...
14 2019-04-25 23:44:32 A5: By sharing all the amazing things I have been a part of because of twitter. Doing PD on twitter and what it is capable of. Putting #'s for different events and explaining what they are for. Twitter for me, stocks the flame when I get tired. #whatisschool
15 2019-04-25 23:43:28 what stocks performed well today?
