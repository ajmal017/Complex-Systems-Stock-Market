1 2018-04-18 23:57:43 @elonmusk What company should i buy stocks from.
2 2018-04-18 23:57:10 Lol they actually know I'm obsessed with stocks they make fun of me but I actually got a couple of my coworkers to open accounts and buy ptn is the 40s they love me so much now lol
3 2018-04-18 23:55:00 I use Vanguard and it's an excellent company.  But I will do what I can to divest of gun stocks, and to ask the company to divest as well.
4 2018-04-18 23:53:45 I'm so glad someone else gets it. My head hurts from that Forbes article. Hammer is correct on the 232 impact. This should first move the US market price and subsequently US miner stocks....all of them. Can we even produce 25%?

6 2018-04-18 23:53:18 Ladies and Gentlemen. Are u building up your profits are building your cash flow?  Profits r selling stocks ard reinvesting  that money to buy more stocks. Building cash is selling stocks and and leaving some of those profits in your account and not touching it. Bullish Horns!
7 2018-04-18 23:52:22 Stocks aren’t gambling. They are faith in a company, which allows it to grow aiding both the investors and the company. This makes the company expand creating more jobs.

38 2018-04-18 23:42:10 In this case they are doing be opposite. Buying before the boycott fully knowing their “boycott” will cause gun lovers to go out and buy guns and gun stocks vallye will go up. Now mention 2 companies and their mutual fund value will go up.
39 2018-04-18 23:41:55 But with that said look at the things he has accomplished, unemployment is at record lows, he passed the tax cuts which is helping me and a lot other people. Stocks are doing great.
40 2018-04-18 23:41:54 Name your stocks?
41 2018-04-18 23:41:39 There is no real defense for owning bump stocks or anything similar.
42 2018-04-18 23:41:23 Cause he has not done anything.
Other then pass that so called"tax reform"
& ban bump stocks. 
Hillary still isn't locked up
We still dont have a wall
Obamacare is still here
We are still for some reason the world police
Isis is still around
All he does is play golf and watch fox

44 2018-04-18 23:40:34 Isn't most of that "money" tied up in family trusts or stocks or stock options, rather than liquid cash?  I honestly don't understand how that stuff works with billionaires like them so I'd love an explanation. Thanks.  P.S. Sarah I'm glad #Iloveyouamerica is returning.
45 2018-04-18 23:40:22 It’s like what AlQaeda did with the airline stocks prior to 9/11. They bought a ton of stock and sold the airlines short knowing the stock would crash after the attacks.

48 2018-04-18 23:37:35 @davidhogg111 Vanguard and its index stocks allowed the middle class to invest and take part of the gains of wall street without paying middleman. Also selectively picking on two companies that allow people to create their own portafolios is a bad argument to attack them.  #bully

52 2018-04-18 23:35:48 Hey Ron, thx for connecting. Eager to hear your thoughts on stocks/investments. I tweet sports or when I’m listening to music.
53 2018-04-18 23:35:23 80% of stocks are owned by the wealthy.  And the stock market has nothing to do with the orange clown and if you know stocks like you say you do you KNOW that much.

55 2018-04-18 23:34:50 For every goal Phil Kessel scores the stocks for hot dog companies spike 15% #philfacts
56 2018-04-18 23:34:13 Success in the stocks means nothing for the average American. It's just lines of credit swapping hands endlessly. I'm sure the people who paid you off to espouse this opinion of "yours" are so very angry about it however.
57 2018-04-18 23:34:08 I keep hearing the average #financialadvisor allocates 3% weighting to #emergingmarketstocks . I don’t believe it. All the old advisors who only buy dividend #stocks and funds based on high yields usually have a 0% weighting. Average probably 1% at most! My opinion, big mistake
58 2018-04-18 23:34:08 You didn't strike $hit A-hole ignorance is taking what someone stated and starting to compare apples and oranges. I was talking about DICKS as a whole not the stock market. Dow dropped today because of IBM, stocks I own are doing well so stfu, energy stocks rose and Nas is up

65 2018-04-18 23:29:52 And stocks normally top out approx a year before recession. Stock top could be a bit early or perhaps another high to come. I have no idea which one.
66 2018-04-18 23:29:33 How long are we going to let a damn kid preach ideals that are similar to that of communism; telling people they can’t invest their money with firms that have stocks in guns?! #freemarket #fuckyou #guns
67 2018-04-18 23:29:24 Yeah right...
How is that Orange kool-aid tasting now?  Own any stocks? If you do your crying in your soup at what the idiot's have done to us.
68 2018-04-18 23:28:07 You do know that a mutual fund is a portfolio of stocks, bonds and government securities right?  If you invest in a mutual fund, you have shares in the brands in their portfolio.  If one stock crashes, you feel it.
69 2018-04-18 23:27:45 100M and not profitable? If the FANGS are breaking up is it time for more mid cap tech stocks?
70 2018-04-18 23:27:39 Getting wealthy that way might not require paying any income taxes at all. It’s just wealth increase, like stocks, where you only get taxed if you’re a professional broker.

74 2018-04-18 23:15:36 So the bump stock manufacturers themselves are moving faster to stop the sale of bump stocks than the Trump administration. Sad!
75 2018-04-18 23:15:35 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your fibromyalgia
76 2018-04-18 23:15:12 All these hyped up stocks will suffer as $LFIN plays out and grabs headlines. It'll cause panic selling for sure. I'd look at the list of usual suspects, do homework, then distribute puts that expire maybe 2 months out among them. Exit after the fear selling stops. Chart it out.

78 2018-04-18 23:13:58 Better buy stocks in them now. If his last boycott call was any indication, their stock price is about to jump about 20%.

81 2018-04-18 23:09:37 @Vanguard_Group does not provide an easy way for investors to determine if funds include gun stocks.

95 2018-04-18 22:54:24 Are you aware that the US’ income inequality is on par with most third world nations, & it has continued to worsen in recent years? We are in year NINE of an historic equity bull market—what makes you think this latest surge in stocks will be any diff than the previous 8 yrs?
96 2018-04-18 22:51:22 Good morning! I apologize for the late reply to my customers. My phone's battery has been dead last night and I am still sorting the phone cases since the stocks have just arrived yesterday. I will definitely get back to you guys! Thank you and God bless 
97 2018-04-18 22:49:56 I see draw of -2.4mb vs -1.7mb 2017.  But still, overall stocks are a lot lower and 2018 build was a lot lower. OK last 3 wks, but next 3 wks will have lower ref.  Refining dip started this wk. Stocks could surprise next 3 wks. I see draws coming down vs 2017.
98 2018-04-18 22:49:41 Oh come on.

Most of those items make a firearm more accurate.

Bump stocks do the opposite.

Bump stocks don't have a military, sporting, or self-defense purpose.

They are dangerous silly toys.
99 2018-04-18 22:49:11 More like age 4 in a size 7 in women with the school stocks because you sit on dick like a pussy. Hush up.
100 2018-04-18 22:48:50 sold ady
101 2018-04-18 22:48:39 Ban automatic, semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks.
Close gun show and private sale loopholes so every gun owner has a background check.

Just to name a couple.
102 2018-04-18 22:44:31 Sure they can....as long as excessive debt keeps getting rewarded and stocks ramp higher for another decade should be know problem!
103 2018-04-18 22:43:02 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
104 2018-04-18 22:42:37 Russia will retaliate tomorrow. Buy gold stocks.
105 2018-04-18 22:41:48 im support trump but,prohibiting bump stocks is wrong.
106 2018-04-18 22:41:35 Four bump stocks turned in in Maryland 81000 people failed to register hanguns in New York, and that's just the law abiding ones, it seems to me that it's more about control and less about safety. Ask Britain what happened when they tried to disarm colonists
107 2018-04-18 22:38:56 As for my own trading, I did buy into $JD today on the dip (liked the consolidation and the market was nice enough to give a great price).  Random stocks are taking off all over the place though. I sold $M today for +90% (and is anyone even talking about that stock?).
108 2018-04-18 22:38:52 DISCLAIMER: ALL OF THE STOCKS/MUTUAL FUNDS/ETFS THAT I TWEET ABOUT ARE ME BUILDING AND MODIFYING MY PORTFOLIOS IN REAL TIME

NO FINANCIAL ADVISOR/INVESTMENT BANKER/BROKER WILL TELL ME WHAT TO PUT WHERE OR HOW MANY SHARES TO BUY
109 2018-04-18 22:35:11 Agreed lol just wanted to see if any other obvious reason but yes low volatility consistent performing stocks great way to hedge  ps former private banker lol
110 2018-04-18 22:34:21 Wakey wakey market . Some good stocks out there . Some I am sure will have game changing  news. Treat them well. Good luck.  Tomrrow another day . 
111 2018-04-18 22:32:36 Those stocks are worthless until Democrats are back in power.
112 2018-04-18 22:31:07 Because bump stocks are garbage and the military has actual automatic weapons
113 2018-04-18 22:27:24 My father told me about what happened to Stocks back then affected him that he was to collect 43 Million from FIRST BANK AND it turned to 3 Million really spoilt my mood kind of sha that stuff affected plenty pple then

115 2018-04-18 22:26:36 ... and you have zero information that it was intended for hand sanitiser.
The solid info we do have, though, is that Syria agreed in 2014 to destroy stocks of isopropyl. You can't make an agreement like this, then go out & buy more!
116 2018-04-18 22:24:01 That’s not accurate.  When he stated he would ban bump stocks— I was thrilled.  When he stated he would IMPROVE ACA to actually make it more affordable AND have better coverage for less, I was estatic.  These are two examples.... alas...  Further, NK is too important.

123 2018-04-18 22:17:54 If we ever want the trillions of $ some sort of shakedown and regulation needs to happen! Think about it, there is 25 trillion in us stocks alone, 5 trillion in gold and a total of like 75 trillion assets world wide, and we sit at just 350 billion. If we could get just 10 percent
124 2018-04-18 22:17:07 Ok let's get real when will $FUSZ have a pull back we all know stocks always have one

127 2018-04-18 22:14:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
128 2018-04-18 22:14:05 and if their stocks plunge due to you, I'm pretty sure the shareholders can file a class action lawsuit against you, and pretty sure they could win. You need too stop attacking lawful guns and law abiding citizens and speak out against mental health more.

Wide-ranging/long-term stuff, including great discussion on regulators' concerns about possibility of financial shocks if unburnable FF stocks suddenly get revalued down. Orr: "Transition needs to start today"
134 2018-04-18 22:11:28 Why would anyone choose to invest in stocks when you can make those returns in days/weeks in Crypto now?
135 2018-04-18 22:11:00 74% Millennials do not invest in stocks. We are here to change it. But first lets figure the reasons. #WhyDoMillennialsUnderInvest

138 2018-04-18 22:09:27 RT APWestRegion: The largest maker of bump stocks, which were used in the Las Vegas massacre, says it will stop taking orders next month.…
139 2018-04-18 22:08:53 stocks going to new 20 day highs on volume, also includes only those that have q/q sales > 20% or q/q eps > 20%
140 2018-04-18 22:08:36 My take? They are just trying to gain new viewers since no one plays stocks anymore.
141 2018-04-18 22:08:30 This happens lol. Usually followed by the need to check stocks, weather and my 401k lol
142 2018-04-18 22:08:11 I was following MarketSmith/IBD lists, eg in MarketSmith 250 they usually have 250+ stocks. But even with alerts, when I see the stock near EOD, most times is extended already. I thought those large lists were good 'cos one wouldn't have favourites,whatever is stronger'd be good
143 2018-04-18 22:08:05 So proud of myself, I made mad money in my #stocks. 
144 2018-04-18 22:07:16 Can be used in hand sanitiser; can be used to make Sarin. A versatile chemical.
However, Syria promised to get rid of all stocks as part of CWC compliance, so it's a little cheeky to simply buy another 1,000 tonnes.

Worth noting that ethanol is just as good for hand-sanitising.
145 2018-04-18 22:06:53 Ah, this one again. The revenue for rebates comes from access fees (and for illiquid stocks, occasionally from listing fees).

155 2018-04-18 22:03:48 You have past 18. Do it anyway. You just have to put more in each month. Always the index etf. If you want individual stocks you're not going to shadow the market and could do better or more likely much worse.

159 2018-04-18 21:58:14 You deserve to be locked up in the stocks and pelted with pickles
160 2018-04-18 21:56:45 But a good amount of crashes like the dot com crash in the early 2000s happened becuase people didn’t understand computers/internet and would literally buy and sell random stocks

But than you also have cases were it’s caused by greed like the 2008 crash cuz the Banks lied
161 2018-04-18 21:56:35 Glad it helped. In my opinion, not really. There are some things that apply, but not all chart patterns will work. They are more like penny stocks right now. I only use TradingView. Hope your trading/investing is going well.

240 2018-04-18 21:05:51 You have a lot to learn, kid. They own these stocks because they are the largest providers of index funds. They only own what they have to in order to replicate the index. And I'd say thanks if I were them because they will now make more money from new funds that exclude these.
241 2018-04-18 21:05:40 Thanks. I’m watching the clock for a 10 bagger.

If a startup meets all its regulatory obligations, the security token classification creates the potential for a wide variety of applications, most promising of which is the ability to issue tokens that represent stocks.

273 2018-04-18 20:55:17 hm, maybe we have different opinions on what makes a good upset character, imo its a character with lots of cheesy set ups that can steal stocks (bayo stuff, shoryu, zss ladder, mk ladder, luigi cyclone/combos, grapplers, d throw 9, falcon knee set ups)

292 2018-04-18 20:39:58 The “court” has independently investigated and confirmed the evidence.
The accused has yet to provide any explanation of its program or stocks.
Yet to explain why it was never declared to OPCW.
Yet to offer an explaination of how it came to be in Salisbury.
293 2018-04-18 20:39:29 The top five stocks that fell today were $IBM, $AMAT, $JNPR, $LRCX. and $MO.
294 2018-04-18 20:38:44 Absolutely . I think that is the case both for U.K. stocks ( which were lagging ) and US sector too . Premier Oil’s (just one example) , Ebitda at this rate could easily be double last year’s .
295 2018-04-18 20:38:28 04/19/2018 Watchlist: $VTVT $IZEA $I $GNMK & Oil stocks ( $SDRL and etc )
296 2018-04-18 20:38:26 The top five stocks that gained today were $ISRG, $CSX, $DVN, $TXT, and $NFX.
297 2018-04-18 20:38:04 Yes.
OPCW took samples and distributed them to their accredited lab system. Results confirmed UK findings.
Russia denied UK initial request for details of the agents, the program and stocks.
The evidence was presented through OPCW as the CWC requires, that’s the international law
298 2018-04-18 20:37:59 Looks like small-cap value stocks are going to outperform this year.
299 2018-04-18 20:37:47 The top five most active stocks today were $BAC, $MU, $F, $GE, and $AMD.
300 2018-04-18 20:37:11 I’m just not sure how you’re expecting to get a profit from Vanguard from this. :) Since they don’t have their own stock, whether investing with them is profitable or not is mostly based on how the stocks of other companies perform.
301 2018-04-18 20:37:07 Disappointing day for this one.
302 2018-04-18 20:35:50 People that talk to each other while jogging freak me out. I can’t even breathe and you’re discussing stocks
303 2018-04-18 20:35:08 Already have stock in both - looks like I’ll be keeping those stocks.
304 2018-04-18 20:34:32 Stocks close mixed as lower shares of IBM weigh on the equity markets.
305 2018-04-18 20:34:08 @KellyEvansCNBC It is reckless to lead with AppleComp maybe in trouble. For years reporters have done this and have caused the listeners to sell and miss ownng one of the greatest and most successful stocks in the market’s history.
306 2018-04-18 20:33:26 Looks like another market maker just out to enrich themselves by aggressive shorting that is mostly facilitated by using manipulative tactics, such as stacking the ask to induce selling on lower volume stocks.  OTCX is clearly a predatory MM that is just out for profits.

308 2018-04-18 20:32:33 overall I like tech stocks and momentum stock most - on both sides.
309 2018-04-18 20:32:00 I messed up again. Chasing a stock. Was out early but decided to buy this morning and got burnt. Can't sell till tomorrow. Finally recieved the "How to Trade Penny Stocks" started reading. Book look excellent. Thanks Tim Sykes for the book.
310 2018-04-18 20:31:11 Vanguard is known for index funds which passively track specific indexes. If the index includes gun stocks, the fund tracking that index also has (a proportional) investment in gun stocks. Just by definition of what an index fund is. It’s not something they specifically choose.

312 2018-04-18 20:30:13 Isn't grid code for coal 20 days? Liquid fuels strategic stocks are 40 days because of import/refining lead times. IPP peakers are 40 hours. Maybe 20 days coal insufficient for catastrophic unforeseen events, e.g. Majuba silos?

316 2018-04-18 20:23:23 Instead of listening to Twitter, Try doing some research. Investment groups like Vanguard and various State pension groups have been struggling for years about being invested in Guns, Tobacco stocks. So this is nothing new, Now it just has a face.

321 2018-04-18 20:21:30 Hmm, the old “Dow Theory” ? I look at where the over-exposure is; passive investors via ETFs are in FANG, Semies and Momentum stocks - not in transports. But many oldtimers still see Transports as a leading indicator for the market - let us see?
322 2018-04-18 20:21:23 Stock indexes barely moved but a lot happened under the surface.

Despite oil, transport stocks rally. United $UAL +4.8%, American $AAL +4.4%, $FDX +1.4%

Many industrials gain. $CAT +1.7%, $BA +1.3%

336 2018-04-18 20:13:46 hahaha, I love that. Somebody on the Left actually saying Trump is acting on knowledge and is knowledgeable. Priceless. 

That was not what you said or what I responded to. The fact is no school shooting ever used bump stocks & we don't know about Vegas.
337 2018-04-18 20:13:33 World stocks edge higher: Europe +.3%; US +.1%.  Volatility was lower than recent days as the market turned its focus to earnings & away from other issues. However, a political war between Trump & Mueller or trade issues would spike volatility. Short-term money avoid market!

343 2018-04-18 20:10:16 Industrials down almost 40pts, but stocks actually looked ok today. S&P +2.25 and Nasdaq +14.14. Breadth fine: 1.2 and 1.6 to 1. Drag was IBM down 12 and Johnson&Johnson off 2.56. With adjustments and divisors, the two penalized the Dow almost 100 pts.

367 2018-04-18 19:52:25 Tech, you are doing a poor job in this discussion. You lost a lot of credibility saying that bump stocks had not been used in a shooting. Your argument about single young women needing long guns to defend themselves did not help. Please, let’s not decline into insults.

379 2018-04-18 19:46:41 I don''t recall the details but there was backlash from health groups, the same way now some groups are bullying indexes to remove gun stocks. Removing $MO was a stupid move and especially replacing it with $BAC, which they took out in 2013.

As at 1/04, they were 3.3 MMT up against 4.6 & 5.3 MMT at 01/03 and 01/02. Coupled with decline in output, Russia's wheat supplies in 2018/19 are seen low than 2017/18.

390 2018-04-18 19:41:31 I've made snarky suggestions in the past that the Left pushes gun control to drive up gun sales and that they must own stocks in gun makers. However, I never dreamt that there might actually be evidence of it. 
391 2018-04-18 19:41:27 Not really missing anything with bump stocks. Novelty worthy at best.

395 2018-04-18 19:38:42 @Fostech_Arms ceased making bump stocks months ago, but their binary triggers business is very much in danger (along with @FranklinArmory 's), because of the proposed "single pull" definition and "other such devices" catch-all.
396 2018-04-18 19:37:55 It's certainly something to carry forward. More stocks falling than rising as we hit resistances. Could be the start to a pullback.

398 2018-04-18 19:36:41 Stocks in arms companies fall every time a Republican is in power, because people don't feel threats against them. The only retailer to say they won't carry AR style rifles is Dicks. ..... they have never carried them, they are more of a high end hunting store....
399 2018-04-18 19:36:23 The idiot Hogg doesn't realize that anyone that invests in stocks and bonds and are diversified probably has investments in gun manufacturers. Right down to Barack Obama. Obama has investments in Smith and Wesson.

434 2018-04-18 19:12:34 I think you are getting into generalizations here. Not ALL people who short stocks are thieves. Some abusive shorts do target accounts of weak investors to rip them off. Some your replies seem to be rhetoric questions. The purpose is to make negative assertions only.

All the best !!
441 2018-04-18 19:10:36 They're absolutely correct about the harsh precedent this sets, which is why the people saying "I don't care about bump stocks" and the fools thinking this is a good compromise are in fact hurting gun rights. Civil rights are not something you should even consider compromising.

458 2018-04-18 19:03:40 Generally agree.  The only pushback I can think of is that while all stocks will get crushed in a nasty bear market / recession, recoveries from drawdowns can be quite different from industry to industry

485 2018-04-18 18:50:28 He's calling for a boycott of Vanguard and BlackRock, two of the largest  investment firms, because they're also two of the largest investors of gun manufacturers.  Hope his boycott backfires and Vanguard and  BlackRock stocks soar.

503 2018-04-18 18:40:46 My basic rule of thumb when looking at Cannabis stocks: if a company has 100 mill shares issued, it needs to earn at least $10 mill per year so that there's .10 cents per share in earnings. A standard PE ratio of 20:1 puts the market price of the stock $2. Adjust accordingly.

519 2018-04-18 18:35:46 Mid-Day: Stocks trim earlier gains, while DOW touches slightly into negative territory.  MBS is currently down 12bps and Yields are hovering near 2.86%.
520 2018-04-18 18:35:02 Yeah I did notice that.  I am in ADBE and feel was one of the strongest stocks to weather this huge pullback we had started in Feb so as long as the general market cooperates (my biggest concern) there should be good upside in the coming weeks.
521 2018-04-18 18:34:04 How many albums to you think amazon stocks before it becomes unavailable and we have to wait for them to restock again? If we had some way of knowing we could get a rough estimate of US sales.
522 2018-04-18 18:33:20 Sounds like a great timing to be purchasing stocks tied to any gun manufacturing!

534 2018-04-18 18:24:02 @RealAlexJones  Vanguard had vote last year regarding divesting 'sin stocks' from its holdings.  It was voted down.

536 2018-04-18 18:22:55 1/ So I'm often asked how it is possible that well-informed individual biotech investors can consistently outperform. That can only happen if some stocks are consistently mispriced in some manner. How can that be in this day and age of widespread information sharing and analysis?

543 2018-04-18 18:16:16 Outside of Construction and some Manufacturing jobs (combined to be ~10% of working age population), I don’t necessary see wage growth occurring unfortunately, which also means I’m negative on real wage growth and therefore most Discretionary stocks.

545 2018-04-18 18:14:33 @davidhogg111 you are Smart enough to know @Vanguard_Group & blackrock are just Brokers & they allow tracking of an Index So your Boycott us misdirected as Gun stocks are listed on The Dow! So any broker allows purchase it stock or Index funds

551 2018-04-18 18:11:34 Keep congress hand off. It’s our money not yours
552 2018-04-18 18:11:10 No it isn’t. More than 80% of corporations are using it to increase executive pay and buy back stocks. Middle America gets the shaft when infrastructure costs pushed into the states will increase taxes dramatically. This, along with irresponsible spending will destroy our economy
553 2018-04-18 18:10:13 A mutual fund is an investment company that pools money from many people and invests it in stocks, bonds, or other securities. When you buy shares, you pay the current net asset value (NAV) (the value of one share in a fund) per share, plus any sales charge (known as sales load).
554 2018-04-18 18:09:06 You think? Who would’ve thunk corporations would use those tax guttings to get richer, pay more to their executives while cutting jobs and shipping work overseas, buying back stocks?

562 2018-04-18 18:05:55 @SJosephBurns do u think small caps stocks can give an advantage in trading?
563 2018-04-18 18:05:27 This is ironic. The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association manages a total of $137 billion in mutual fund assets. In total, the firm has 10.3 million shares of gun-related stocks in 12 different funds. Thirty-two percent of its funds have exposure to gun-related stock.
564 2018-04-18 18:05:12 Silly human with your use of the term assault rifle. So cute. Bump stocks are already illegal. Just because something looks scary doesn’t make it any more dangerous than something else that isn’t as scary looking.
565 2018-04-18 18:05:00 Many more than just those mega caps. I don't discuss specific indiv. stocks though, sorry.
566 2018-04-18 18:04:26 Too bad that so many growth stocks are high momentum, and value stocks low momentum. It pays to integrate, instead of mixing the generic factors.
567 2018-04-18 18:03:57 @_nirajshah A great admirer of your work. But viewing your various Episodes, there are some things which present some contradictions... Many times u show us the 10 yr return or Pe of  nifty / sensex... Y showing an index where over the yrs the stocks have changed
568 2018-04-18 18:03:56 Stocks up over 3% today... Your inconvenience is good business..
569 2018-04-18 18:03:26 In some cases, very small percentage of fund is invested in gun-related stocks. For example, 1 fund managed by Vanguard has just .001 percent of portfolio in these companies. But others hold more, like Invesco/PowerShares which oversees fund w over 3.5 percent of its portfolio.

580 2018-04-18 17:56:41 It's unlikely that WS is forgetting anything. WS is about short term investments with the idea to make money while the bubble lasts. They all believe they are smart and can dump the stocks before the losers are left holding the empty bag.

582 2018-04-18 17:56:28 He's right that ISIS and rebel forces have already used CW a number of times. Foreign Policy magazine even did a whole piece on rebels capturing CW stocks from a Syrian army base in 2016.

586 2018-04-18 17:53:43 the basic target functions of "investing" in stocks, bonds, or commodities is REALLY simple= "Buy Low then Sell High" ..the definition of what is LOW & HIGH is impacted by whether you're a short or medium or long term investor but the notion you buy & HOLD (NEVER SELL) is MORONiC

608 2018-04-18 17:43:17 ok this makes sense. Did not consider that. I deal with only upward sloping stocks so this didnt even come to mind. I carried over niche knowledge and tried to apply it to a broad index.

646 2018-04-18 17:16:42 $CVM, $BPMX , $CRMD ,big hedge funds trying to get them cheap to add more shares ,they short stocks and same time buying
647 2018-04-18 17:16:41 I don't judge a president on fluff - because that's what confidence is. I work in commodity stocks, when prices are based on confidence or fluff, it's not tangible. I don't judge a president's economy until it's had time to fully develop.
648 2018-04-18 17:16:19 I've written stories today about stocks with the tickers $BBBY and $BBY today. Time to go eat something that has the letters B and Y in it. Blueberry yogurt, here I come!

651 2018-04-18 17:12:19 .That jackass should be set in stocks in downtown Las Vegas and pelted with rotten fruit by passing citizens.

658 2018-04-18 17:09:06 Ignore the aholes - gonna find them everywhere. Vanguard does not hold these funds - individuals who use Vanguard as their investment vehicles do. Since the majority of the stocks are found in passive investments, it's not an easy thing get away from if you are a passive investor
659 2018-04-18 17:09:04 I'll just invest all my money on bighit company or maybe invest on stocks coz... Bruh maybe... Just maybe I'd have a chance 
660 2018-04-18 17:08:43 It’s like bump stocks all over again
661 2018-04-18 17:08:34 My suspicion is many Fund Managers get blinded by perceived huge Discounts when they buy in pre-IPO etc. In many cases the Stocks are garbage so they get stuck with something worthless.
662 2018-04-18 17:08:12 England has become an unbareable place to live on @theresa_may watch. She had an open goal succeeding the worst PM in history and has still managed to out-do him. She is the calamity this country is in personified. Bring back the stocks I say!
663 2018-04-18 17:08:02  Done. Many of us have Vanguard in our 401Ks. Call and let them know how you feel and ask them how they can use their considerable market power to reduce gun manufacturer stocks from their investments.
664 2018-04-18 17:07:06 I believe you're the one that's embarrassing yourself you keep saying take an economics class but obviously you don't understand economics if corporations are buying back their stocks they aren't giving their employees raises their only taking care of their stockholders

681 2018-04-18 17:01:51 When did you purchase the stocks that are up 400%? There were only 3 stocks in 2018 that posted triple digit earnings and 4 that have done so to date in 2018. All less than 200%. What financial mathematical wizardry are you performing?
682 2018-04-18 17:01:45 Well on average Premium Bonds give about the same return as savings accounts, even when you factor in the tax saving. It's a fun thing to have but not a serious investment in my view. Better to put the money into a Junior ISA (ideally stocks and shares) and leave it there :-)
683 2018-04-18 17:00:30 NK is taking the piss out of us. China is too. ISIS is nowhere near gone.

691 2018-04-18 16:57:43 In a Bull market:
Don’t worry if stocks fall on bad news, that’s normal.
Worry when they don’t rally on good news. That’s an ominous sign.
692 2018-04-18 16:57:30 Among other factors I think ultimate objectives are underappreciated. My daughter's college fund emphasizes preservation of capital so while it includes some stocks I view as a little risky ($SQ) it's more weighted to solid stocks purchased at reasonable valuations ($MKL, $DIS)

708 2018-04-18 16:51:05 Trump's admin just eliminated small investor protection. Pres. Obama had passed an order that individual investors be protected and that brokers need to keep the interest of the investor first.  Today that is being revoked allowing brokers to sell junk stocks again.

780 2018-04-18 16:20:20 To be honest joe is making a good point. I have traded stocks and forex before and I have to admit the similarities although there are differences I would say there are more similarities as it involves human emotions

Oh yes OWPC looked at declared stocks and sites so maybe Syria lied?

786 2018-04-18 16:18:10 Stocks are modestly up this morning, while bringing the indices back into positive territory for the year.  MBS is taking the brunt of the Equities good fortunes, and is currently down 14bps.  Yields are fighting overhead resistance, and may continue to push MBS down.

805 2018-04-18 16:10:40 Vanguard invests for passive index tracking funds; these stocks are part of the indexes. You're literally demanding Vanguard abandon their business model of the last half-century. I support your general efforts, but with all due respec t you've greatly overreached here.

821 2018-04-18 16:06:04 It's always amazing to notice that $AMZN's Q1 2018 EPS expectations are "so easy" that they imply a -15.5% drop YoY. Other stocks would be so lucky (Q2 and 2018 are a different matter, but AMZN usually guides lower anyway).
822 2018-04-18 16:05:50 Finally earnings are outweighing the trump nonsense. Huge gain on my $BABA May calls. Holding for more upside. Stocks going full on bull back to test January highs

906 2018-04-18 15:26:06 Putting money in a savings account is neither a risk or a real way to make it grow. I remember taking my aunts to cash out CDs at 10 or 15%, and those were low risk. Taking a real risk with your money would be putting it in stocks, not a bank account. That’s just called banking.

1157 2018-04-18 14:02:25 Before Tuesday, FANG stocks had lost more than $200 billion in market value since March, however, Tuesday’s rally added nearly $80 billion back to the group’s market value and helped drive the SP500 up about 1%.
1158 2018-04-18 14:02:10 My lightbulb moment was on board a Cornish fishing vessel in the mid 1990s. In the name of protecting fish stocks, the crew threw back a substantial net-full of dead mackerel then went below and opened tins of imported mackerel for their tea. :((

1166 2018-04-18 14:00:09 U.S. stocks struggled to hold on to modest gains in early trade today, with the Dow attempting to build on an earnings-driven rally  that has taken it back into positive territory for the year.

1174 2018-04-18 13:57:52 How so? The Las Vegas shooter is the only reported user of bump stocks. None of the other shooters bothered with them.
1175 2018-04-18 13:57:11 Saw that a moment ago and my eyes nearly exploded. Absolutely crazy to say the least. Possibly a buying opportunity since stocks aren't much lower at this point in time. Still feels like we have more downside than upside this far into the rally but it's hard to say. Craziness.

1287 2018-04-18 13:14:39 A mutual fund is a portfolio of stocks, bonds and government securities.  So yeah, you’re wrong.
1288 2018-04-18 13:14:25 The company that makes bump stocks is closing its website and no longer taking orders, following Sessions' ban. (Why didn't Obama do that?)
1289 2018-04-18 13:14:11 @BeFullyInformed  5 trades, couple of stocks, strikes do not seem right, as currently stock price is much lower.  Thanks
1290 2018-04-18 13:13:56 From what I’m seeing of those supporting, it is all about money. They want to line their pockets just as he’s doing, and everyone/everything else be damned. That’s what I keep hearing: “Taxes! Stocks!” The greed and logical fallacy of it all makes me ill.

1292 2018-04-18 13:13:36 $USDTRY around a percent lower since the Erdogan announcement. Istanbul stocks higher. Turkish govies recover. 

All on what was supposed to be terrible news for the country and the Lira due to an early election.

Let's see what CBRT does in a week.
1293 2018-04-18 13:13:10 @Varneyco Did I just hear getting out of gun stocks because a teenager doesn't like them?  And I heard how smart Starbucks is.  You like Starbucks rather stupid management as well as overpriced coffee?
1294 2018-04-18 13:13:07 This outlook stood out to me more than anything when I attended your co-author/counterpart @DanZanger seminar back in 2011... You don't decide what stocks to buy, the market tells you which stocks to be in.
1295 2018-04-18 13:12:54 Then perhaps you could keep your promise to ban bump stocks that white people use. That was your promise.
1296 2018-04-18 13:12:30 #AMP just confirms for me why its a good idea to steer clear of financial stocks during #BankingRC Run a mile.
1297 2018-04-18 13:12:14 Thanks Little @davidhogg111  I didn't know @Vanguard_Group was supporting stocks of gun manufactures! I shall add more $$ to my investment accounts and make sure I am not left out. Freedom of choice in American is for all the people!

1300 2018-04-18 13:10:54 Why be an ass to the rest of us who were smart enough not to get duped? Buying stocks, especially penny stocks always comes with that risk.

1302 2018-04-18 13:08:58 Well, ask the NRA about this "Capitalism isn't the basis for murder." Gun sales and stocks in gun makers soar after mass shootings.

This has led to big revenue gains at banks with sizable trading operations
1305 2018-04-18 13:07:13 When are you going to ban Bump Stocks like you promised?
1306 2018-04-18 13:05:53 How did you do this? Vanguard doesn’t have their own stock. Not sure what else you’re invested in but any Target Retirement or US market/S&P 500 fund from any company invests in gun stocks also.
1307 2018-04-18 13:05:17 Commodities catching up and overtaking stocks again today led by metals & energy. 

This multi-asset momentum thing really seems to work!

1308 2018-04-18 13:04:24 A large operator or investor acting singly cannot often, in a single day’s session, buy 25,000 to 100,000 shares of stock without putting the price up too much. Instead, he takes days, weeks or months in which to accumulate his line in one or many stocks

1310 2018-04-18 13:04:07 Not keen on AiM either. 

BR has started to have a negative effect on stocks quoted on AiM, there were 3 AGM votes last year where the management wanted to list the company to the main market and BR investors opposed this.

The Chancellor is aware & I think it may be addressed.

1341 2018-04-18 12:48:05 Except they don’t do that at all. Time and time again we seen that they don’t invest in hiring employees or expansion, they simply buy back their stocks to inflate prices. Do you not remember what they said at the Wall Street Journal “CEO Council” event just last year-?
1342 2018-04-18 12:48:03 I want to thank @covel for his recommendation to trade everything - With my small profit from M6B yesterday (along with everyone else apparently) i’ve now traded some of everything stocks, bonds, commodities, and currency.

1345 2018-04-18 12:46:46 Geez. I’m actually asking honest questions. I can find a list of the guns they found. I don’t see where we know what bullets struck from which guns. Further, I don’t see which guns had bump stocks. Where is that?
1346 2018-04-18 12:45:31 Listening to the radio in the morning, NPR is going to do a story after the break on whether Netflix stock is overvalued.

1349 2018-04-18 12:43:51 If some of your buy points are reached at market open, do you recommend waiting a little (5, 15 mins or more) before entering to see if it holds? Some people recommend the end of the day, but a lot of stocks are extended by then...
1350 2018-04-18 12:43:43 lots of resistance, lots of bagholders. those stocks are pigs. always looking for a good short r/r. the premarket entries were on small shares, just to get the feel for the stock and scale in more if it works. once it opens then size in if lower highs
1351 2018-04-18 12:43:39 Sure, but the S&P 500 minus certain stocks isn't the S&P 500. They'remostly in the business of creating index funds that track exact indices....

1388 2018-04-18 12:28:51 If buying and holding stocks is your investment strategy then you will be subject to large drawdowns if you own stocks when they are very expensive.

I'd been planning for weeks that this year was going to be the best sell prior to May opportunity for a long time but too many of my stocks look poised for liftoff.

One thing the market is good at is giving out conflicting messages.
1395 2018-04-18 12:24:46 ... Wise decision ;)

1402 2018-04-18 12:22:44 I think it’s got a good trend.  Sometimes stocks have psychological issues passing round numbers like 50, 100, etc.  let’s see what happens.  Earnings coming up too

1407 2018-04-18 12:20:40 Actually it's because these stocks are in published indexes (Read: S&P and MSCI) that passive strategies track, just like Mike said. Has nothing to do with picking stocks.

Eventually, the massive buildup of debt, and fiscal irresponsibility will come home to roost. Stocks have benefitted enormously from CB policy and debt. So unfair to our children. No-one cares!

1433 2018-04-18 12:05:52 These companies aren't sensible targets for boycotts.

This is almost entirely passive index investing.  They are intentionally avoiding making investment choices.

Divestment of a company’s stock doesn't usually hurt a company in the long term.  Take a look at tobacco stocks.
1434 2018-04-18 12:04:40 Lol stocks arent the only thing you can invest 2 million in, hell, invest in your own business idea, someone elses business idea and take partial ownership, or real estate, which will appreciate massively and you can male inclme off of it in the meantime.

1438 2018-04-18 12:03:48 So in a rising market the risen value will be cash in the sidelines when you have sold your position.  Add to that possible selling of bonds in favor of stocks, no bad thing considering increasing deficits. Money flows in and out of the market influence us all.
1439 2018-04-18 12:03:20 Trying to beat the market in the short term rarely outperforms a well-thought, long-term buy-and-hold strategy.

1440 2018-04-18 12:02:59 There is PLENTY of value in this market. Problem is certain stocks in certain sectors are super over priced, so they can't go down because it will take the whole sector down. Stupid ETF's ruin everything.

1533 2018-04-18 11:11:24 Oh no! It's so confusing though. Since we had 2 stocks yesterday, the first one had only 6 hours in between and second one 24 hours. How does this add up? I am so confused! 
1534 2018-04-18 11:10:28 A lot of Britons did not care for the Treasury's estimate because Britain had meagre investment in stocks in the EU. I recall reading that under a soft Brexit households would lose ~£800 per annum which is still a fairly conservative estimate.

1551 2018-04-18 11:00:11 Everyone has tough patches.  The issue whether the poor performance reflects a weakness in the investment approach.  Many of Woodford's stocks have lost value on a permanent basis.  They won't bounce back.  This suggests that the investment approach has been the issue.

1556 2018-04-18 10:59:09 It was a tax cut, not tax reform. And the beneficiaries were wealthy individuals and corporations. The large corp. used the additional savings to buy back stocks and increase dividends. Your supporters are ignorant of this fact.
1557 2018-04-18 10:58:27 Stocks, not sales. Check the graph and the dates again. Stocks have been plummeting for every major American business over the last few weeks because of Trump’s latest round of disastrous policies.

1657 2018-04-18 09:39:31 As companies that let customers buy whatever stocks they want?

1662 2018-04-18 09:36:48 Hello T! We're sorry about that. We are working on getting stocks to all our branches ASAP. For stock inquiries, you would have to directly contact our stores:
TriNoma - (02) 901 3980/81 / 0917 515 2671
The Annex at SM City North EDSA - (02) 441 1883 / 0917 515 5391
1663 2018-04-18 09:36:14 Its just because our system was denied by courts ORDER who looks for everyone (involved in this business and extended the time to free up the remaining stocks with a manufacturer nd wholesalers)
Which in future will harm our environment and their is a chance of raising corruption
1664 2018-04-18 09:34:00 Grabe,  wag nyong pakyawin yun stocks sa isang tindahan.  Magtira naman for others.  O kaya, lipat kayo sa ibang stores.

1676 2018-04-18 09:29:49 Exactly right Buffalo. Finally someone mentions they mainly have index funds so stock selection will not change unless index changes. Vanguard is one of the largest investors in all stocks because of the size of the company. And lowest fees so boycotting will only hurt yourself

2094 2018-04-18 03:51:55 Just a heads up, Vanguard and Blackrock don't have a say in the stocks they buy in most of the funds that own gun company stock.  You could ask S&P to consider excluding them from their indexes or maybe ask Capital Group, Invesco, or other companies that chose gun cos.
2095 2018-04-18 03:50:08 Wait so what stocks do they own for gun companies? I get you want to put it all under an umbrella but I feel it is important to show which companies they have money in. A gun manufacturer could be purely for the military for all we know.

2150 2018-04-18 03:13:02 $99 but you can get a 15 day trial for free, and you'll have all the other services like stocks, I don't host for that time. No credit card needed for a trial so you don't have to cancel.
2151 2018-04-18 03:12:36 I guess now-a-days stocks need to have a PE of 200 of more, like $NFLX, to go up on a earnings beat. The sell-off we are seeing from Lam Research $LRCX, despite the company showing great numbers, makes no sense.
2152 2018-04-18 03:12:27 I'll never fall victim to stocks because none of it makes any damn sense I just can't take that sort of risk. #taxtime #wtfamidoing

2159 2018-04-18 03:09:02 It seems that 99% of crypto investors haven't figured out the difference between holding stocks and holding a coin. The companies issuing the coins haven't done much to change this. Wabi is the classic example of a useless token issued by a company with a solid project.
2160 2018-04-18 03:08:46 You mean those taxes that were cut so that the big businesses could hold on to more money for their business and used to buy back stocks instead  and to hold on to more money to pay themselves?

2275 2018-04-18 01:59:59 Penny stocks and crypto currencies will fersure cause me a heart attack in the future, screw these roller coasters breh but I’m still about it :// 
2276 2018-04-18 01:56:34 Invest in a couple of low cost blue chip stocks.
2277 2018-04-18 01:54:46 Someone tell me some new information.. what should I know about it politics, business, stocks, housing market, new books...?!?!?
2278 2018-04-18 01:54:06 Bear mkt in stocks or hurdles in life clearly differentiate Lions n pigs..
2279 2018-04-18 01:53:36 More Jobs, risings stocks, higher pay, less taxes, strong economy, security, Isis defeat, NK on path to denuclearization, decreased illegal immigration, China reducing tariffs... If he’s America’s villain he’s doing it wrong.
2280 2018-04-18 01:51:14 Few stocks defy valuations but for how long is the question!
2281 2018-04-18 01:51:13 I'm telling you, this little terrorist needs to be investigated by the Federal Trade Commission for manipulation of stocks. 
I bet he isn't boycotting anything his parents or family are invested in without selling it first.
2282 2018-04-18 01:51:02 Buy the strongest stocks.
Avoid the losers.
Repeat.
2283 2018-04-18 01:50:57 Be specific. What has Trump done to you that he is such a pos? What facts? Or are you just going along with the rest of the losers that just can't stop crying over their big unexpected loss?? Jobs are up economy is way up stocks are up unemployment at the lowest in 50 yrs
2284 2018-04-18 01:49:26 Piss off #HoggWash @davidhogg111 .younwill,fail,in this boycott,this is unlike sponsorship,this is billions of dollars invested in the stock market by millions of invested. @davidhogg111, you paying my monthly n quarterly dividend if I sell my stocks?

2288 2018-04-18 01:46:02 Respectfully, that isn't appropriate in this situation.

Divestment in the stock market is usually toothless.  See the history of tobacco stocks.

These companies offer a wide variety of index funds, which invest in a huge swath of stocks.  They (mostly) don't "pick" stocks.
2289 2018-04-18 01:45:09 Normal monsoon forecast boosts rural economy. Best sector to invest in? Consumer or better still FMCG. I have said this in the past. Saying it again. In Indian consumption will remain an ongoing story for many many tears to come. Stocks? HUL, ITC, GCPL, Marico, Dabur, Colgate etc
2290 2018-04-18 01:44:55 Saan ka makakita ng govt hospital na walang stocks ng reagents for BASIC labs (crea, cardiac enzymes)?!? Yung totoo?!?!?
2291 2018-04-18 01:44:53 It sucks you moron! 

The rich companies are buying back stocks and giving CEOs pay raises with their tax windfalls. They are not   giving raises and starting new companies.

The working class are just considered a necessary evil they have to pay in order to make money.
2292 2018-04-18 01:44:50 Greed corrupts. The more people locked up, the more the stockholders make. Many GOP in Congress own those stocks & many get payoffs from lobbyists in the form of campaign contributions if they support private prisons. who are paid by tax payers $$ but make a profit & issue stock
2293 2018-04-18 01:43:48 New word - I knew that GAFA in the media nowadays refers to Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. But I just learned that #FAANG refers to five popular tech stocks in US - #Facebook #Apple #Amazon #Netflix #Google oops
2294 2018-04-18 01:42:24 DB on Consumer Stocks: Estimate there is consensus earnings upgrade potential of 5-15% for Consumer MNC subsidiaries in India (HUL, Colgate, Nestle, GSK Cons), if the Uday Kotak Committee report on Royalty & Brand Payments to related parties is implemented by SEBI

2296 2018-04-18 01:41:34 Oh $hit! Lol, last month i was debating a Trumpterd about REITs. He was insistent that reits were terrible yada yada, when the reality is that REITs have performed better than stocks over the last 20 years. He told me they were scams.  I didn’t understand.  It all makes sense now
2297 2018-04-18 01:41:31 Okay, wala pa sa 500 ipon ko pero April 21 na magkakaroon ng stocks yung brushes ni anneclutz.
2298 2018-04-18 01:37:03 I heard from a customer the other day that options are the way to go. But I’ve made a little bit so far just buying small stocks
2299 2018-04-18 01:36:48 $255 million spent on bombing Syria  because we don't like their METHOD of killing thousands....bombs ok, gas not so much!  Trump makes $$$. every time we bomb them with his Raytheon stocks!  Flint Michigan could have clean water, Veterans healthcare for that $!  @cnn @msnbc
2300 2018-04-18 01:35:45 Bump stocks should be legal. Stop punishing law abiding citizens for the deplorable actions of a few criminals. Stop caving to the outspoken, ignorant, fear-mongering minority.
2301 2018-04-18 01:35:28 Sweet my man start with stocks then learn options much more potential profits and you can trade on rising markets, dropping markets, and sideways markets.
2302 2018-04-18 01:35:26 @Vanguard_Group and @blackrock are actually going to be thanking @davidhogg111 when people start investing heavily in their stocks. The left doesn’t learn. @NRA membership skyrocketed guns sales skyrocketed Trumps popularity skyrocketed The liberals should be earning a commission
2303 2018-04-18 01:34:32 I signed up last week I wish I had seen it before  I’m just starting out w stocks figured I’d try it
2304 2018-04-18 01:34:27 You. Are. Funny. #HoggWash boycotts and activism to date:

#2A - NICS check record in March

@IngrahamAngle - 20% viewership increase

2318 2018-04-18 01:23:11 I'd rather own real estate, crypto, stocks, businesses, etc. instead of buying expensive clothes, cars, trendy things, etc. 

Why do more people not think like this?
2319 2018-04-18 01:22:23 Look at how much gun stocks grew during the obama years, Vanguard is not dumb.
2320 2018-04-18 01:21:42 Looking for sources of company/stock finance news that provide feeds we can leverage to point users to stories relevant to particular stocks. Any ideas? (Google finance is not an option)
2321 2018-04-18 01:21:06 Well, guess they are going to be doing very well very soon.  

They will surely grow at least 20% in stocks after this.
2322 2018-04-18 01:20:54 True, but if you buy quality you can make a fortune or hold on till it appreciates. These stocks don't fall much
2323 2018-04-18 01:17:00 Is he crazy? Why would I want to take out my money from my best performing stocks and shares?

2325 2018-04-18 01:16:12 Look up the IRS tax tables for Wisdom #1. 10% income tax bracket coupled with child tax credits, standard deductions, plus EIC? Yeah that's a refund more than contribution. And for Wisdom #2: exactly. 

I maintain the income tax as is to be simply immoral.
2326 2018-04-18 01:15:36 You seemed to imply that them investing in gun stocks is “supporting his politics”
2327 2018-04-18 01:14:46 Huh? You want ppl to boycott INDEX FUNDS bc they track a market that happens to have gun stocks, along with literally every other type of stock?
This is stupid almost beyond belief.

2333 2018-04-18 01:11:59 I'm with you 100% on most things but not this. Vanguard is not an investor in gun manufacturers. Vanguard operates index funds. Those funds are baskets of stocks to match various stock market indices. Naturally gun makers will be in an index, so they will be in the matching fund.
2334 2018-04-18 01:11:33 I'm not constantly watching the exchange like I used to. I'm just busy with other things. That's why i try to put money in companies I see as stable. This is the reason why most folks better off in unit trusts. They not gonna watch stocks closely

2336 2018-04-18 01:10:54 apparently nobody explained to him that the planets two largest index funds, which are passive investment managers, would necessarily be large investors in these companies bc they buy stocks that represent the broader market?
2337 2018-04-18 01:09:05 He can see my portfolio and apparently has it out for me. He comes out with BS on each of my stocks. They crash the first couple of weeks then soar to all time highs. He hasn’t been right since $VRX.

2351 2018-04-18 00:54:08 That which you tax you get less of. Tax investment in growth, and you get less of it. Tax stocks and the market goes Bear. Tax them enough, it crashes. 

There's ALWAYs somewhere else to put money. Metals, commodities, OTHER countries that don't tax stocks.
2352 2018-04-18 00:53:16 These stocks are about to go way up
2353 2018-04-18 00:52:26 BlackRock, the world’s largest asset-management company, announced the creation of new investment products that specifically exclude stocks associated with gun retailers and manufacturers earlier this month.  High school gun activist Hogg failed to note this in boycott message.

2359 2018-04-18 00:47:37 $gthp the point is the future is bright look for the quarterlies last year is just that all the recent traction is happening now if anything the big buyers will be buying it when the panicked retail is panicking about the past #stillabuy all in my opinion #stocks #nasdaq

2363 2018-04-18 00:45:00 First, they will discuss new gun laws. They recently supported a ban in bump stocks (to my disappointment). There is already a law requiring background checks. The fact that the FBI sucks at it does not constitute a new law.

-Against background checks on all gun purchases.

-For easy access to assault rifles for teenagers.

-For access to guns for the mentally-ill & terror watch suspects.

-To keep bump stocks legal.

2373 2018-04-18 00:39:12 Several people questioned, nowadays, why RAIN kind of stocks are not showing strength even though the index is moving up.

Pattern this week should still be “day up followed by day down followed by day up etc” *but* w/increasingly higher lows as sentiment turns bullish

2404 2018-04-18 00:15:11 $tsla . Couldn't agree more. Have you ever looked at the track record of most shorted stocks? I have.
2405 2018-04-18 00:14:54 Thanks James: I understand what a superflex is and how Rivers is valuable. If you're in win now then maybe, but I wouldn't--and I'm a guy who stocks win now players in dynasty. But you need a Rivers +. Think Rivers and Chris Thompson (or something along those lines).

2412 2018-04-18 00:10:47 RE stocks last year moved up and this year gave good corrections also but the underlying theme still alive || one analysis says because of RERA, 90% of the existing players compelled to exit, they cannot survive so remaining 10% only going to fill up the gap of the entire space
2413 2018-04-18 00:10:39 compared to others here in Canada r good employers with benefits & bean stocks. May not pay their taxes but pretty good employer
2414 2018-04-18 00:09:48 Asia stocks begin with a positive tone as region gets tailwind from Wall St, where earnings drove sentiment and with the Nasdaq leading the gains as Netflix soared on strong subscriber numbers; ASX 200 (+0.2%), Nikkei 225 (+0.6%), KOSPI (+0.8%)
2415 2018-04-18 00:09:37 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
2416 2018-04-18 00:09:37 Yup, they lied. Shocking. They lied about my paycheck, they lied about my income taxes, my income is stangnent, I didn't get a bonus, and his crazy has dinged my 401k/stocks. 

The GOP is totally working for average Americans (sarcasm).
WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE!!
2417 2018-04-18 00:08:53 Well he admits that stocks could but he thinks wont. He doesnt think metals manipulation is real. But he does think metals look good on charts

2420 2018-04-18 00:07:03 $SPY $VIX Some say buy with SPY above 50 day average. Others say sell, the VIX is over extended. I continue to focus (long) on select stocks
2421 2018-04-18 00:06:57 LOL i just played someone for less than a minute. Bodied them so hard on the first 1.1 stocks that they exited the game mid combo and said gg.
2422 2018-04-18 00:06:17 At least you still have your right to marry one of those 10 y/o that are being standardized by the ruling class. And bump stocks. And keeping the poor, poor. You have been given so much this year. Having a functional Education Dept. is asking a little much
2423 2018-04-18 00:06:14 I think this is gonna be one of the best packs in the community no lie so big and best stocks and everything you need!

2426 2018-04-18 00:04:36 @thurrott @bdsams Do either of you know what happened to Cortana's cards in 1803/RS4? I can see stuff (flights, stocks, packages, etc...) that I want her to track in her notebook but I can't find a way to surface any actual info.
2427 2018-04-18 00:03:36 Like every other commodity, bump stocks wear out. Won't be long till their gone. Won't stop mass murder's though, but every little bit helps.
2428 2018-04-18 00:02:25 Bad move bro, those stocks are going up. They also own Twitter. So you should just delete your account.
2429 2018-04-18 00:02:02 と思ったらユナイテッド特売り…なぜ？

2431 2018-04-18 00:01:14 Does it even matter that the FANG stocks are overvalued... buy anyway? #Netflix
2432 2018-04-18 00:00:55 Profitable trading has more to do with the long term management of risk than the actual entry/exit strategy. #trading #stocks
2433 2018-04-18 00:00:42 You need to ck facts. I can not debate with someone who is ignorant to know what is the truth. Unemployment was high. Stocks dropped hard. Loading thousands of jobs. The stocks gained 11000 points unemployment 5.8. Health care. When he left. Look it up
2434 2018-04-18 00:00:00 DH, you have become a media crazed little twerp. IF the 2 firms sold off those stocks, the firearms mfg wouldn’t go out of biz. IF they did, Glock, Sig, Beretta are easily imported. Besides, IT WAS LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO F’D UP! County Sheriff and FBI.
2435 2018-04-18 00:00:00 Asos a lancé des articles fabriqués au Kenya par une créatrice noire. Les vêtements sont graves beaux. On compte sur vous pour épuisé les stocks à fond.
