14 2018-06-23 23:56:49 Yeah I don’t like the way coconut oil smells enough to wanna smell it during sex. I’ll pass.

40 2018-06-23 23:55:24 Oil train derails, dumping crude oil into river in Iowa. If only there was a way to transport oil without having to rely on trucks or trains
41 2018-06-23 23:55:24 I wanted to do something, and then I wanted to be bratty and stay home so I put this oil stuff all in my hair, and now apparently I’m supposed to get ready 
42 2018-06-23 23:55:15 Ugh with black pepper and some olive oil.
43 2018-06-23 23:55:02 But if immigration has been so weak, where are those millions you speak of?  Snake oil much?
44 2018-06-23 23:55:01 wei my face kan so teruk this past few days, malam tadi buat routine bha-claymask-oil cleanser. smooth gila. no more tiny bumps 
45 2018-06-23 23:54:54 Mmmmm you need oil for much more than energy generation.
46 2018-06-23 23:54:48 Only parts of Australia Daave. You may not realise it but Aust is nearly as big as the contiguous US states, should not over dramatise the weather reports, not even to sell your GSM=Ice Age, donate-so-I-can-do-my-work snake oil!
47 2018-06-23 23:54:40 That’s a good place to start. In general Over time I’ve tweaked my recipe to use regular yeast, 50/50 King Arthur bread & ap flour mix, yeast, salt, olive oil & diastatic malt powder (but that’s optional). Being in LA your results will differ from swampass Cincinnati

53 2018-06-23 23:53:58 If only there was a way to transport large quantities of oil long distances safely and efficiently. Oh wait there is, its called pipelines.
54 2018-06-23 23:53:51 Why are we selling oil to the US @cnnbrk
55 2018-06-23 23:53:41 houston's pride takes place in the shadow of the former Enron buildings and other oil & gas companies
56 2018-06-23 23:53:32 Like oil & water ....  
57 2018-06-23 23:53:22 May we ask why this return was denied? Did you still have gasoline and oil in this mower? The store cannot accept any small motor with gas or oil in it. You will need to drain the fluids.
58 2018-06-23 23:53:20 #PermitPatty you really need 2 sample what you sell. Your way too uptight and angry . Ohhh or r u just trying to get rich off of CBD oil ? Bet the cops have better things 2 do than answer your stupid call.
59 2018-06-23 23:53:16 The oil is brown, so I’m shocked it’s taking you so long to lock it in a cage and deport it.

74 2018-06-23 23:51:09 Whale blubber oil is probably not available, huh?
75 2018-06-23 23:51:08 Correlation isn’t clear yet.

Indians cook with clarified butter (ghee) & mustard oil & eat snacks fried in suspect oils.

Indians are also (notoriously) unathletic. Walks & cricket doesn’t cut it.

78 2018-06-23 23:50:39 Dear #PermitPatty,
A friend suggested that I try CBD oil for chronic low back pain, but now I'm concerned that it might turn me into a racist. Or possibly a meme. Since you're an expert on such matters, what would you recommend?  Thanks.
79 2018-06-23 23:50:31 Thanks my dude

84 2018-06-23 23:49:23 Hahahahaha! Sorry but that subsidised by England has always been a myth, Scotland's oil taxes to Treasury as 2nd biggest net contributor for decades so WE subsidised England.Scotland's BlockGrant is OUR money to spend as we want, NOT your money you idiot!We paid in plenty taxes

90 2018-06-23 23:48:59 In hopes of finding a non-chemically enhanced product that is claimed as natural for these pothole pores of mine! Meanwhile... Olive oil
91 2018-06-23 23:48:44 That's why promoting electrical engines is so important, reliance on oil is akin to bondage.

They have a life expectancey on motors now lol even if you change oil regularly and drive like grabdma lmao
97 2018-06-23 23:47:13 Too bad you supported the murder of cubs and oil drilling, wildlife you claim to love will be dead.

99 2018-06-23 23:47:11 @TemeculaHyundai so I got an oil change and they washed my car, they must have dried it while dirt was still on it because my trunk has micro scratches in the paint. My car is brand new, 2018.  I’m PISSED.
100 2018-06-23 23:47:08 Eh trump has always been a snake oil salesman. Even back when he was a Democrat! Of course now he is a russian puppet which IS worse.
101 2018-06-23 23:47:06 I am attacked left and right for supporting my president. Just bring it!
102 2018-06-23 23:46:54 I personally dread going to @Walmart. They never have anything I need. And when I inquire about the product. I'm told to order online. They sell paper shredders. But, not oil sheets to keep blades working properly. They don't care if customers ruin a brand new product
103 2018-06-23 23:46:49 If only there was some type of Piping system to transport Oil safely...hmmmmm
104 2018-06-23 23:46:40 Watching the season opener of game of throne In a bar with my lady sauced and being allowed to smoke my oil pen was top 5 last spring
105 2018-06-23 23:46:30 On the contrary, I'd like to see our armed forces brought home where they'd be less likely to get hurt or killed. Don't see why our soldiers should die for oil and gas pipelines.

107 2018-06-23 23:46:20 It costs me more to fill up my car with gas than it does to change the oil... that’s just not right.
108 2018-06-23 23:46:13 Putting castor oil on my shit every day. Twice a day. For the next 180 days lol omggg
109 2018-06-23 23:46:05 If only the anti-pipeline flower children realized stopping pipelines doesn’t stop the flow of oil. It still gets to the refinery by truck or rail
110 2018-06-23 23:45:59 Olive oil, every day
111 2018-06-23 23:45:32 Did they ever patch Sonic Mania to fix the boss from Oil Ocean Act 2 from being a complete and utter nightmare?
112 2018-06-23 23:45:21 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
113 2018-06-23 23:45:11 แต่หน้าทุกคนคือขาวเนียนมากก เหมือนตุ๊กตากระเบื้องเลย งือๆ อยากเอากลับไปไว้ที่บ้านน 
114 2018-06-23 23:45:00 Gotta have the oil too 
115 2018-06-23 23:44:37 My wife says it tastes like fish oil. Bought 1/4 cow and she won't eat it.  Honestly, I'm good w our ground beef bc really lean, no fish oil taste.  Grilled a chuck roast and had to trim the fat off.
116 2018-06-23 23:44:25 Used to even Airlines leaders, newspaper men, oil barons, cattlemen, bankers all in competition could eat together & still do their jobs. Now everyone acts like a-holes that can’t get along, where is the decorum? The professional courtesy?
117 2018-06-23 23:44:22 Ary ye oil pkaya hay bangan me ? Ya bengan oil me ???
118 2018-06-23 23:44:11 Trump is a poseur who dreams of becoming a snake oil salesman.  Even that is something he cannot achieve.
119 2018-06-23 23:43:30 yup spoon sesame oil, black pepper, sea salt, coriander.... ok lets go
well done I am hungry it is 2 in the morning here .... mehhh
120 2018-06-23 23:42:58 Destroying our relationships with longtime allies. Cutting healthcare for children. Removing protections for consumers from banks. Opening up National Parks for oil drilling. Shall I go on?
121 2018-06-23 23:42:50 I’d feel unsafe eating at the #RedHen .  They probably spit in food if they suspect you’re a Republican.
#Fascism
122 2018-06-23 23:42:44 There are places like that in DC. I'm hoping we can skate by with admonitions to NEVER EVER SHARE HAIR OR HEAD THINGS but shit happens, and I guess it's easier than covering the kid's head in olive oil yourself?
123 2018-06-23 23:42:36 Yeah you can substitute with it in cakes if you're out of eggs or oil.
124 2018-06-23 23:42:36 ดีมากฮือออ ผู้จัดปีนี้ดีอยู่นะ ตอนไฮทัชนีแบบไม่มีคนมาพูดให้รีบๆๆเหมือนปีที่แล้ว รู้สึกได้โฟกัสศิลปินเต็มที่มาก

126 2018-06-23 23:42:28 @Take5_OilChange So I dont know how to get to work on Monday because Take5 screwed up my oil change today. My car cut off on me twice on my way home and now my car has loud knocking noises.
127 2018-06-23 23:42:21 You never answered me. How is fighting against other countries who proposed no threat to you is considered fighting for freedom. Stop being the usual brainless US soldier and think for once. You wanna go die for oil fields go ahead but you ain’t fighting for freedom when u invade
128 2018-06-23 23:42:18 Been making the same point all say.  It would be epic.  The owner of that place would be brought up on civil rights charges
129 2018-06-23 23:41:59 urban decay de-slick oil control setting spray is great!! i get the small one it’s $15
130 2018-06-23 23:41:53 Current prizes for oil are not only sweeping enormous amounts of money into the pockets of the oil industry,but also the dependency on energy is used to control nations.The fall of the Soviet Union was preceded by a phase of cheap oil,which meant fewer $ for the Soviet Union.
131 2018-06-23 23:41:51 “Yoyoso ky kag face” thANKS nay, extra negrev coconut oil lang yan 
132 2018-06-23 23:41:45 Just started a spousal argument because the husband saw me putting oil in my car. 

133 2018-06-23 23:41:42 What the hell is wrong with? TV preacher snake oil salesman.  God and jesus both say go to hell  .
134 2018-06-23 23:41:26 THIS WILL happen as movement of oil into BC is being hampered by the ridiculous, continuous delay of #TransMountainPipeline. We will all need oil for decades, and to help us transition into cleaner energy. Let's do it safely. #buildthepipeline
135 2018-06-23 23:41:07 Busy. Busy. Busy. Busy. NO one burns more useless midnight oil than Bergie.
136 2018-06-23 23:40:58 BAKİNG SODA:
Make a paste of baking soda and lemon and leave it on a skin for 5 minutes., then wash the face with cold water. You can also dip a cotton ball in tea tree oil and simply apply on the pimples. Wash your face after 20 minutes.
137 2018-06-23 23:40:51 Maybe they know why the oil price rose.." The one on the left has "you bet I do" written all over her face !!!
138 2018-06-23 23:40:48 have you tried Jamaican castor oil? 2 of my friends who have had babies swear by it
139 2018-06-23 23:40:38 OK so had stint in Aramco one of the prestigious Oil MNC's  in KSA but when.I remember meeting you in Sarita Vihar in 2001 (my guess) and u were waiting for ur H1 Visa to States.. Interesting.
140 2018-06-23 23:40:29 チャーリーさん、どーしたんだろうな…
141 2018-06-23 23:40:16 Wallahi I'm serious
142 2018-06-23 23:40:10 what if we’re missing the point on that “what if baby oil is made from babies” question? what if coconut oil is made solely for coconuts to use?
143 2018-06-23 23:40:09 今日午後からゲリラサラダ油来るらしいよ。
144 2018-06-23 23:40:04 My vape thing has started tasting like Nutella mixed with olive oil, which is not what I asked for. It's after taste hell, no less.
145 2018-06-23 23:40:04 I put coconut oil in my coffee, cook with it rub it on my arms and use it as a marital aid.  All that's true except the last part.
146 2018-06-23 23:39:59 I know her. She’s been shady. Over-charging cancer patients for CBD oil and fighting them when they call her out.
147 2018-06-23 23:39:33 Must be great as fresh as it gets!  I use coconut oil in cooking instead of heating up olive oil that changes its properties to less healthy.
148 2018-06-23 23:38:59 ‘I’ll just use coconut oil it’ll be fine’
149 2018-06-23 23:38:56 Do you think the baker in Colorado is a loser as well? He did the same thing.
150 2018-06-23 23:38:45 same as everything else. it's all about the oil, and creating slave economies to serve the #unsc, of which #thisisiamerica is a member. this is just part of #ww3 #genocide program
151 2018-06-23 23:38:13 I'm intrigued about the refusal, to have an honest discussion, to solve problems. But take a look at "problem solvers", and you find cash flow. No problems, no cash flow.
152 2018-06-23 23:37:53 Yes. Wing kink and no, I didn't have the balls to ask about the oil glands bahaha.
153 2018-06-23 23:37:42 La grasa en el gas oil de Ancap está ocasionando severos perjuicios. Filtros, bombas, etc. Como se sanja esto?
154 2018-06-23 23:37:10 Listen yeah, throw the oil pack away and use a tablespoon of sunflower oil from the bottle wallah life becomes so much simpler
155 2018-06-23 23:36:59 Olive oil ,
156 2018-06-23 23:36:56 Who is the owner?
157 2018-06-23 23:36:41 The Hol Grasp at your Wall suitable for tomorrow, go as "extra", but significant faction dyeing them to your oil.

159 2018-06-23 23:36:30 If the story about a little girl having the cops called on her for selling water by a woman makes you immediately react to explain how the woman sells CBD oil not weed - you have missed the point. Your empathy levels are about where that woman's is.

168 2018-06-23 23:34:46 Heavy oil beats coal. You know, the thing China builds a plant every month to burn?

1) take frying pan out of oven
2) preheat pan

173 2018-06-23 23:33:15 Now all you need is a KC-130 full of batter, a lake of boiling oil, and a crop duster with some powdered sugar and you can make the world's largest funnel cake!

175 2018-06-23 23:32:51 I don't like vegetable oil/canola oil. Sunflower/safflower is better, but still not a match for kadlekaayenne.
176 2018-06-23 23:32:46 Indian food has a lot of oil, butter, carbs, sugar. Only shows that there are unhealthy vegetarian diets as well - are you surprised?

178 2018-06-23 23:31:36 I loved it when I discovered that "macassar" was a Victorian hair oil, hence "antimacassar."
179 2018-06-23 23:31:34 For the Saudis, it’s pocket change. They’ve earned it  exporting oil and price fixing the price of oil and undermining their competitors by controlling the volumes of oil traded on the market.

188 2018-06-23 23:29:59 Iowa is a solid Republican state.  They don't mind a little crude oil in their water, if fact they prefer it that way.  Drill baby, drill!

191 2018-06-23 23:29:18 Please do, the oil companies need to sell more gas for profits that can be converted into Republican Candidate donations.

197 2018-06-23 23:27:45 It's sad but clear that thousands of US troops died in Iraq for oil.
198 2018-06-23 23:27:45 Woke up by the fragrant of something kind of freshener. Apparently sib lit up the burner trying the new scented oil. 
199 2018-06-23 23:27:34 So I put a little olive oil in a baking dish and layered sliced ham, sliced tomatoes, asparagus and sprinkled feta on top -baked for 20 min at 350. Mmmmmmmm
I ate it all

206 2018-06-23 23:26:31 The truth is the oil industry is raping the American public. And the rich get richer.
207 2018-06-23 23:26:00 What determines price? Because we import alot, includin food, so a change in d exchange rate will affect price of food. Why did exchange rate change? 92% of Forex earning was from crude oil. As crude oil price crashed, we earned less, hence Forex increased affecting all imports.
208 2018-06-23 23:25:58 My relatives have been telling me as long as i can remember to put coconut oil in my hair and i have Finally done it and it’s wonderful for natural textured hair
209 2018-06-23 23:25:49 Cause I gotta say, I was looking for CBD oil to try and help my dogs anxiety levels recently, and I would have been pissed to have purchased this lady's product only to find out she pulled this shit after the fact. I dont like giving my money to assholes when I can avoid it.
210 2018-06-23 23:25:35 I heard the owner is the president of the local business association. So, she’s going torpedo her business and drag the other locals with her.
211 2018-06-23 23:25:23 Hopefully if it comes to that you'll be content with open borders & multiple new arrivals doing work around the house for a plate of food & a bed of hay in the barn. It means the DemocRats won all three branches of the federal gov't and they shut down oil & gas production. #MAGA

213 2018-06-23 23:25:04 Scotland had their chance to leave the UK. Based on the oil figures they were predicting to finance their devolution they probably would've been bankrupt by now had they won independence. Enjoy your English subsidised living and leave the complicated shit to us.
214 2018-06-23 23:25:03 This is fine for some small towns.  Wind and solar will never be productive enough to replace coal, oil and gas.  In fact, if they were actually forced on the world, it would mean millions on deaths in the third world.  Bring on nuclear energy in the 1st world.
215 2018-06-23 23:24:54 If there is a way to find the info there’s a way to know for sure.  
Oil might go back a long way in the Trudeau family, beyond Pierre.

221 2018-06-23 23:24:12 I dig that candle fixer lady, but I just started another one of her candles and there was just way too much oil and herbs in it. Smoky room, candle out.
222 2018-06-23 23:24:12 Why not just make Mexico our 51st state?  We'd get fantastic vacation areas, lots of new oil reserves and a VERY TINY southern border to protect!

227 2018-06-23 23:23:43 The #truth is neither political party really has the huevos to stand up to big oil and take away their subsidies and reveal the real cost of our fossil fuel habit. Until that happens gas prices will continue to be a political football.
228 2018-06-23 23:23:38 @MSNBC Trump has given Putin,  higher oil prices, and stopping military maneuvers with SK, so what do you think the meeting with Putin will be about (behind closed doors)? Asking for help in the med-term elections?

248 2018-06-23 23:20:41 They want cheap oil to sell high right ...
249 2018-06-23 23:20:34 Whooa! I can’t believe your level of ignorance, I’m sure you dnt know what is called human resources, there are thousands of people from other countries in Nigeria too. The world can survive without ghana but I doubt if it will without Nigeria a major oil producing country.

308 2018-06-23 23:11:34 They are running out of oil,that's why they are stealing Yemen's. The fake royal family is looking for foreign investment and a diversified economy (away from oil) this is their way of looking modern to entice western investors.
309 2018-06-23 23:11:24 Hahahaha
310 2018-06-23 23:11:23  A railroad official says 14 of 32 derailed oil tanker cars in …
 (That's how her momma used to dance on that Seagram's gin)
311 2018-06-23 23:11:14 Well that is what oil is so it's not inaccurate, I just don't know what they'd get from pointing that out though.
312 2018-06-23 23:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: spicy crust with sad coconut oil and pulled pork.
313 2018-06-23 23:10:41 They’re about to become the #1 producer of oil & Nat Gas on the planet. They don’t really need our help.
314 2018-06-23 23:10:29 Just taught Myles how to make popcorn the old fashioned way - using a pot, lid, oil, and the stove top burner. Passing the survival skills along.
315 2018-06-23 23:10:26  why isn't she required to take a bath? Anybody writing down how long it's been since that head seen some soap? Looking like olive oil on Crack rock!
316 2018-06-23 23:10:18 They will.  Every time OPEC tries to flex their muscles, they make it more profitable for American companies to produce more oil.  Nobody can out-produce us.  Like so many foreign countries who love "sticking it to the US" - they're learning it isn't so easy anymore.
317 2018-06-23 23:10:17 I'm independent and disagree with both main parties on some points. I can discuss my differences with Republicans. Not Democrats.
318 2018-06-23 23:10:15 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
319 2018-06-23 23:10:08 Russia oil minister: We came up with oil proposal well before Trump pressured OPEC:TREASONOUS LARDAZZ DON-DA-PHUK'N-CON DRUMPF couldn't pressure anything not even one of his phinga-phukked cunts !!!!
320 2018-06-23 23:10:05 #US wants #Kurds to take over that area so they can secure OIL FIELDS near by...
321 2018-06-23 23:09:56 No. I’m pretty sure oil companies are still investing, but choosing where to. I know they’re not exploring anywhere substantially. Only state oil companies getting discount surveys done. This is a piece of additional information not a comment directly on article.

324 2018-06-23 23:09:28 I fucking hate coconut oil
325 2018-06-23 23:09:25 I get the short wide mouth mason jars (I forget the oz), boil water, pour it into the jar and then mix in a tablespoon of coconut oil and 3 drops lavender oil. Then fold and stuff baby wash cloths down into it
326 2018-06-23 23:09:18 It is really, really good. Kind of an up to date 'Dallas' but instead of oil it's cattle ranching. Lots of neat characters all with their own demons and problems. I'm hooked after the first 2 hours.

330 2018-06-23 23:08:06 Read online that peppermint oil repels ants. Now I’m Recovering from what can only be described as an Essential Oil Spill. Not sure about the ants but now I want to move 
331 2018-06-23 23:07:47 Circa 2000, I remember a huge chunk of the country couldn't accept they lost the presidential election, and instead starting indulging in off-the-wall conspiracy theories about hanging chads. I think it was about then...
332 2018-06-23 23:07:44 I know they did!
333 2018-06-23 23:07:42 I bought aromatherapy burner and essential oil yg bau menyan dan bau jasmine, setan-lyke, so that when my room smells like setan and my frinz will be lyke 'nyium2 bau something ga meg' and then i can be lyke 'ah engga' like a boss to scare the hell out of them 
334 2018-06-23 23:07:36 In lighter news, I got an oil change and a new transmission for FREE. God has surely smiled on me.  #GodsPlan
335 2018-06-23 23:07:30 It was the owner who asked them to leave.
336 2018-06-23 23:07:23 someone is swolloing snake oil!
337 2018-06-23 23:07:18 Sometimes theres a deal at the body shop where you can get the toner and the oil in a deal so try to ask for that cause then you can try both out. The oil is more for spot treatment and the toner is for everyday all over use
338 2018-06-23 23:06:57 I know I've definitely got the frame for lean fitness. Hell, I used to be in my teens. I'm trying to get that back.
339 2018-06-23 23:06:55 i really wanna cut out oil from my diet for at least a month... i've been watching too many documentaries
340 2018-06-23 23:06:53 Hot oil...when done right, it’s freaking fabulous!
341 2018-06-23 23:06:50 Used coconut oil in the brownie mix bets on whether or not #KakhisPaul notices and on whether or not he flips out #cookiechronicles
342 2018-06-23 23:06:33 It took decades to rid USPharma of "Possibly effective" drugs. This is giant step backwards to snake oil peddling.
343 2018-06-23 23:06:18 Received a 2month trial of @SIRIUSXM at last oil change. Listened quite a bit! Found out they are huge advertiser of @IngrahamAngle. Called @SIRIUSXM to have them remove me from their count of subscribers. Great service but will not allow them to count me as a supporter.
344 2018-06-23 23:06:06 Notice how you cherry pick spills to talk about. If that oil shipped by rail in Iowa had a pipeline...

347 2018-06-23 23:05:33 But, but, he paints veteran's portraits! 
Yeah. And he and Rummy left Iraqi weapons depots unguarded in favor of oil wells and banks.
348 2018-06-23 23:05:24 I knew about Iran's oil, but not in the detail. It was more about American money that surprised me.
349 2018-06-23 23:05:21 @Sears 6 hrs for 4 tires and a oil change? How is this real!!! Customer service not helpful
350 2018-06-23 23:05:07 No, it's called revenge which again is not right(being clear the way y'all think is horrible) oil and control of other countries play a big part of it  when the US was in their country bombing a lot of innocent people died so they want 2 fight back and AGAIN INNOCENT people die
351 2018-06-23 23:05:01 ehhhhhhh, I think there are pretty significant distinctions across Spanish, Moroccan, Italian, Levantine… some shared notes, sure (olive oil!), but hardly the same
352 2018-06-23 23:04:36 Those picture are  horrible to watch. 
I see plastic in the ditch everyday. Why do we use this type of plastic?
It's made from oil mostly, right? Plastic made from other sources, like Hemp are much more degradable, hm? If a whale swallows it, it melts in stomach, wouldnt it?
353 2018-06-23 23:04:27 It's part of the payback. We knew he'd kill the Iran deal because it was worked out by the previous Administration. The price of oil going up wasn't collateral damage. It was carefully planned like every other thing traitor Trump does to the USA. Just like 0 tolerance. Planned!
354 2018-06-23 23:04:13 With the bipartisan passage of H.R. 5515-115 (2019), our military budget will have increased more in the past two years, than China and Russia's ENTIRE military budgets.

US imperialism and militarism must be reigned in. No more drone war, and no more wars over oil!

356 2018-06-23 23:03:37 Trump has what exactly to do with world oil prices?  Give your head a shake.
357 2018-06-23 23:03:18 Stephanie Wilkinson and her pussy husband got a panic attack that a lifetime chance to humiliate public official and political nemesis and to make their little joint and names famous will never repeat itself. What a disgusting little hodgepodge of communist sleepers
358 2018-06-23 23:03:08 I disagree. When it comes to this hateful admin, I disagree. They’re stealing and lying and they’re making it easy to dump poison and oil and hard to get medicine and food. I just can’t anymore. I can’t go high on twitter.
359 2018-06-23 23:03:08 Just broke the oil cartridge I bought YESTERDAY
360 2018-06-23 23:03:02 Its the oil sheen spray in my hair!
361 2018-06-23 23:02:54 Bought my mama another Chanel body oil cuz them her favorite .
362 2018-06-23 23:02:53 in MN he said if NK plan works its cuz of Americans. he's always giving credit to American exceptionalism and entrepreneurship. he wont let our tax dollars be wasted. he wants to make sure America has its own natural resources so other countries wont put us thru the oil embargo.
363 2018-06-23 23:02:53 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
364 2018-06-23 23:02:47 Mexican grandmas are magic.

365 2018-06-23 23:02:44 falsies and oil control 
366 2018-06-23 23:02:28 hakan is very good be cause if you are an american like ken you have most likely never needed to fight a large turkish man who is red and covered in lots of oil which will distract you for long enough for the big red and blue man to squeeze you very hard
367 2018-06-23 23:02:26 Oh no, Kelsey! For best results, be sure to shake really well & hold the bottle a good 12"-18" away from your face. If you still notice spots, pat gently with a damp Beauty Blender before it dries down. You can also try using prior to makeup for amazing oil control. let us know!
368 2018-06-23 23:02:18 Got my Vitamin C serum and re up on my rose hip seed oil
369 2018-06-23 23:02:07 This may actually be profitable for oil companies?
370 2018-06-23 23:00:58 Except the arguments don’t make sense. Why repeal net neutrality? Why rescind protections for oceans against oil? Why antagonize our allies?

373 2018-06-23 23:00:17 Lol AGW is idiotic. I don't think so.

BTW how many barrels of dilbit spill in the Kalamazoo pipeline oil spill?

Pipelines routinely have small spill. And frequently have large ones.. many 10s times more than rail spills.
374 2018-06-23 23:00:16 5 of 5 helpful hints for increasing your intake of fruits and vegetables: Sub them in. Substitute pureed fruit like applesauce, bananas or peaches for half the butter or oil when baking. @WellVanderbilt

379 2018-06-23 22:59:30 Look Lars. BC and Que are akin in that.

We "block pipelines" because the risk to our jobs us too high to us. That is our right, regardless what Big Oil influenced politicians say.

That Alberta Arrogance just pisses us off.

They don't have a divine right to our coastline.
380 2018-06-23 22:59:29 your mcm dabs the oil off his pizza before eating it
381 2018-06-23 22:59:02 I'm addicted to coconut oil 
382 2018-06-23 22:58:41 Cause of Iowa derailment, oil spill amount still a mystery http://news/cause-of-iowa-derailment-oil-spill-amount-still-a-mystery/1258443189
383 2018-06-23 22:58:31 Nope, totally good move. Otherwise school becomes dramatic. It’s important for kiddo to learn how to spend a hour away from mom in good care.
384 2018-06-23 22:58:12 Iran and Iraq are places of great importance don’t be fooled by the government or military action because what you see isn’t always as black and white as it seems. It’s a diversion and our military is just a pawn in the game of chess. Oil is just one TINY factor!
385 2018-06-23 22:58:02 Not yet.  The reviews are being actively policed.
386 2018-06-23 22:57:52 Stock Market up, Job report at 30 yr high, NK might b changing course, business flourishing, more $$ in paycks, housing up, land up, businesses coming back, low taxes, unburdened regulation, oil/gas exploration high, love of Country best in years, want more? Lean urself
387 2018-06-23 22:57:47 I dont think Kurds can change course easily anymore. What can they offer? Its not like the US would let go of the oil & gas fields in case the Kurds want to switch sides. They could have gotten a foot in both doors by letting SAA and govt civil servants back into Afrin. But now?
388 2018-06-23 22:57:35 I don’t thing so !!
Every analyst and and oil commodities brokers knows what’s ahead of them
Demands exceeded supply in the short term. That’s what makes them panic for awhile until they see it more available 
We definitely see adjustments until Dec. meeting
389 2018-06-23 22:57:19 Avocado Toast, also I love make a simple (no lettuce) salad with diced up mozzarella, cucumbers, tomatoes, avacado and balsamic/olive oil.

396 2018-06-23 22:56:28 Apparently it was a party of 8 which means Sanders & fam probably had booked a res. beforehand which means this was all for publicity
397 2018-06-23 22:56:14 A Washington waiter told @SebGorka that the most of the meals he had eaten all had something gross done to them.
398 2018-06-23 22:56:09 Or trying to build a safe space. Thankfully, GOP places don't really need them. ;)
399 2018-06-23 22:55:55 To be candid, Tommy, I'm usually surprised people don't know the basics if not the detail. You don't have to be middle-aged to have read something of the theft of Iran's oil. In fact, the BBC, of all folk, gave 30 minutes to an Iranian journalist to recount what I write about.
400 2018-06-23 22:55:53 btw, we are NOT a ‘region’. We are one of the two nations that signed the Act of Union. It was supposed to be a “partnership of equals”. Risible. We’re getting out and we’re taking our farming, fisheries, oil, gas, renewables infrastructure with us. The UK is over.
401 2018-06-23 22:55:52 PSA: If your Natural hair feels dry and brittle or doesn’t retain moisture I Highly recommend a Mayonnaise and Hot Olive Oil Treatment 
402 2018-06-23 22:55:48 You're misunderstanding this. By producing an extra million barrels a day, this brings DOWN the cost of oil. That's what Trump wanted.
403 2018-06-23 22:55:48 Bc they're #chickenshit and blocked their phone and reviews ...
404 2018-06-23 22:55:37 Got all pretty then i sat my ass on my body oil 
405 2018-06-23 22:55:32 This Baby Powder Oil Smell Good As Sh*t
406 2018-06-23 22:55:30 When fresh tomatoes are ripe chop into 1/2 inch cubes, add lots of fresh garlic, dried oregano & olive oil for a Sicilian salad. Good as a side or add to bbq'd Italian sausage on a roll, placing the tomato salad juice on the roll first. Everyone loves this.
407 2018-06-23 22:55:14 Have to say for a comedian, you're not very funny.  Don't quit your day job.
408 2018-06-23 22:55:11 Both cases are stupid. Both cases they would have been paid to make food, period - not to pass judgement on the end user. So if a fat person goes into a bakery how long before bakeries say 'not going to feed you, you've had enough already'?
409 2018-06-23 22:55:08 Hmmm...Don't asked for Federal help. It is an EPA issue and we know how the GOP feel about protecting the environment. Why don't you pay for your own oil skimmer to clean it up.
410 2018-06-23 22:55:04 What were they afraid she was going to do?
411 2018-06-23 22:55:01 I put coconut oil in my hair.. you know cause it’s supposed to be good for you, now the shit won’t come out 
412 2018-06-23 22:54:36 This is a new point.

Some Albertans get upset when Quebec tries to block pipeline/oil. They chime in using the transfer payment angle, you could share your knowledge less argumentatively. I think your approach is not great. That's all Diane!

Let them feel while you educate!
413 2018-06-23 22:54:22 Everything I eat is 100% organic from local farms and the cheese is made from coconut oil, vegetables and nuts  all fair trade too, I make sure no human or animal has to suffer for my meals 
414 2018-06-23 22:54:06 We fight each other like oil and water, but you and me got chemistry.
415 2018-06-23 22:54:06 That's the best thing that could have happened...saved the chance of having her food messed with otherwise. Blessings in disguise...

419 2018-06-23 22:53:16 Audi, I think you are telling Mark porkies? Your prices on your website are fixed: £170 for an interim service (oil change), £338 for a major service.
420 2018-06-23 22:53:09 I'd suggest cinnamon oil, but anything mixed with barf doesn't sound too promising. 
421 2018-06-23 22:53:08 The very day Trump was elected.
422 2018-06-23 22:52:57 Have made my own muscle massage oil for grumpy thighs and knees.

Apricot kernel oil base with anti-inflammatory rose geranium, pain relieving rosemary, and antispasmodic sweet orange.

I smell like slightly spicy Turkish delight and it's bloody lush.

425 2018-06-23 22:52:42 สวัสดีครับ
426 2018-06-23 22:52:40 Not very bright, asking half the population to ignore your business.
427 2018-06-23 22:52:35 Oh I know. I wake up everyday to freaking Oil Citiers and rabid West-Allen and Snowbarry fans in my mentions. I'm just like 
428 2018-06-23 22:52:29 I’m sure the EPA ,45*  @VP Pence and @GOP have a plan in place in case of oil spill , it will be as effective as the recovery effort in Puerto Rico after the hurricane
429 2018-06-23 22:52:09 She didn’t take her Cannibus oil today!
430 2018-06-23 22:52:04 It's CBD oil. The "medical" part of marijuana. It actually doesn't get you high. It can help with pain, anxiety, insomnia...

That said, let's put this racist biatch out of business.
431 2018-06-23 22:51:59 Gas prices higher due to Iran sanctions placed back on (resulting in less oil on market) = good move - national security and stopped putting money into the largest sponsor of terrorism in the world.  Wages are up, bonuses up, jobs up, unemployment down.  You are misinformed.
432 2018-06-23 22:51:55 I can guarantee you that it’s a hell of a lot less likely to happen with a pipeline, like the one that’s been in place for over 50 years. But, you have every right to be against oil because you don’t use anything fossil fuel based, right?
433 2018-06-23 22:51:28 And I bet you that it's more likely the EU will create a war to occupy north africa to use it as solarthermal powerplant than the ITER spitting out a working fusion power plant design.

#sarcasm aside, of nations fight wars for #oil, they'll annex & occupy for harvesting energy.
434 2018-06-23 22:51:08 I finally changed my oil. Just went 7,000 miles over. Nbd really.
435 2018-06-23 22:50:51 I was in my 40 when I got back into it.  You can still achieve some great results!  Happy to help any way I can.

439 2018-06-23 22:50:34 You should look at @billiehsutton Just because he has a D doesn't mean he is not a good candidate. Unlike Noem, he has a history of working for the middle instead of the fringe. She will sell off our lands for oil, and ignore the massive impact Trump's trade war will have here

442 2018-06-23 22:50:13 NL is on edge of bankruptcy. It was a "Have" Province for only 2-3 years. 
Between Oil Prices plunging & Muskrat Falls disaster, it's a mess.
But the unending AB bitching & whining is a bit much.
443 2018-06-23 22:50:12 Only thing that ever works for me is an ice pack directly on the back of my head, narcotics, and peppermint oil.
444 2018-06-23 22:50:10 Yeah one of the reasons sure. One of the other ones was that standard oil bought its competion, or drowned them in a price-war..
445 2018-06-23 22:49:57 There is no "middle" except that AB swings between arrogant exceptionalism in good times and whining entitlement in bad. Being that Canada contributes about 5% to the global supply of oil, we are price-takers. This does not, however, prevent AB from managing its resource income.
446 2018-06-23 22:49:51 This is the America Trump is creating. Doesn’t look “Great” to me. However millions bought his snake oil.
447 2018-06-23 22:49:49 So this year trump didnt help victims in pr, didnt do anything about school shootings in US, to putting immigrants in cages, and supposably getting rid of obamas order to protect the ocean from oil spills
WHY DO YOU PRAISE THIS MAN. 
HE IS A PIECE OF SHIT.

And yall gonna die...
448 2018-06-23 22:49:43 I'll be online at 6pm pacific for a CANDLE LIT OIL TEASE, shower voyeur group show and then a get-ready-with-me wine and hangout!! HAPPY SATURDAY WHEEEE
449 2018-06-23 22:49:41 It was an interesting challenge for Madam Clark to explain palm oil to the very patient chocolatier #superfrenchteacher
450 2018-06-23 22:49:36 This disregard  permeates sensitivity to all nature  We are a biosystem...interdependent. You don't pour oil into the Louisiana Bayou, kill and discard animals and treat fellow humans as disposable and not have it come and bite you in the ass.
451 2018-06-23 22:49:33 I can’t believe y’all been letting me sleep on coconut oil this whole time smh
452 2018-06-23 22:49:14 In a Trump Administration with Corrupt Pruett at the head of EPA, not a chance that they will protect the Bayou. Oil drilling off the coasts is more to their liking. Big $$ in that!
453 2018-06-23 22:49:14 I'm not interested in boycotting them or attacking their yelp page. I just want the left to be consistent. Businesses should be able to refuse service for any reason and the market decide the consequences.
454 2018-06-23 22:49:13 馬油を英訳すると…うーむ(中の人の英語力の限界)
455 2018-06-23 22:49:02 3 hour wait for this oil change but it was only $47
456 2018-06-23 22:48:38 I'm probably having a pipe dream, but I keep hoping to get fit enough to try my hand at parkour.
457 2018-06-23 22:48:24 You just said that the price of crude controlled the price of gas.  And now you're agreeing with me!  

Crude was 40 long before the hurricanes.  I know because my friend shorted oil and did very well.
458 2018-06-23 22:48:22 @realDonaldTrump  big deal now would be to lower oil prices by opening up some of the reserves as our oil production is sufficient for an emergency
459 2018-06-23 22:48:01 I went to the doctor for an annual the other day and she was like "ooh, you smell nice. What issss that?" 

wearing that mermaid oil lol
460 2018-06-23 22:47:56 If you have enough omega 3's in your diet...and use coconut oil on your skin...you will never burn in the sun. In moderation..2-3 hours
461 2018-06-23 22:47:39 They will keep voting for #Republicans until they all drink crude oil. @EPAScottPruitt @EPA #GOP
462 2018-06-23 22:47:26 Train wreak dumps oil... “ What, ever happend to those upgraded train cares?? Oh, that’s right regulations got scraped, to costly!”
463 2018-06-23 22:47:26 Exactly why pipelines are the best way to transport oil & gas.
464 2018-06-23 22:47:24 The guy doing my oil change place just started a sentence by saying, "as you're regularly checking your dipstick, if you notice..." and I just want to thank him for thinking I have my shit together enough to think about my car's oil at any time except for when the light comes on.
465 2018-06-23 22:47:16 You don't have to educate barrels of oil.
466 2018-06-23 22:47:13 How is this good news? I know so many were clamoring to be able to take CBD oil for years. Now that a Drug Co goes and calls it a DRUG, and pushes for approval, it is now classified as a drug instead of natural substance? Like patenting an apple! Wld make apples illegal.
467 2018-06-23 22:47:10 1861
468 2018-06-23 22:46:51 
469 2018-06-23 22:46:30 90W oil rubdown?
470 2018-06-23 22:46:18 We know. You sold Russia the election, brown immigrants to the prison companies and the lands to oil companies. What else is for sale?
471 2018-06-23 22:46:11 Oil@
472 2018-06-23 22:45:53 Cooking in stainless steel is kind of like anal. When you think you have enough oil. Add some more.
473 2018-06-23 22:45:49 Considering I plan on trying to get myself more fit in the near future, this is very useful information that I will make use of.
474 2018-06-23 22:45:41 I’m glad @PressSec left. Lord knows what they would’ve done to her food
475 2018-06-23 22:45:27 Stupid Alberta and our stupid oil. Where’s the wall when they need it!
476 2018-06-23 22:45:25 Coconut oil iruntha kaila Thadavikanga .apram sleeping ...
477 2018-06-23 22:45:22 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
478 2018-06-23 22:44:50 Mom: You and your father are like water and oil. You don’t mix well. That’s why you need to look for your own place now.

I’m actually looking now. hahaha
479 2018-06-23 22:44:45 Yeah but I know a woman 
   who rode the bus.....got off...
   walked around ..and got hit by
   the bus.       busted
       " Snowfarts....look, it takes
   a lot of oil to build and make
    bikes. Pavement, trucks to
  bring pavement, diesel to run
  Roller..oh f it !
480 2018-06-23 22:44:43 Pretty sure it is an American owned train hauling Alberta oil!! Hmmmm maybe a pipeline would be safer!!
481 2018-06-23 22:44:31 Caught a yucky cold going around and all I want is a hot bubble bath and coconut oil to lather on after
482 2018-06-23 22:44:23 NL is in desperate Financial circumstances + hit hardest by EQ formula (set during NL best financial yrs)- get NOTHING back despite doing worst of all.
But AB whined loudest when World Oil plunged, AB is whing loudest now even tho econom it is doing Best of all Provinces. Grow up
483 2018-06-23 22:44:06 Apparently, cannabis oil does not help with weight loss...
484 2018-06-23 22:44:06 Good olive oil is great. It's a shame I can't get the good stuff in the US easily. I was in Remagen once and they had a weekend market with the good Italian stuff. I regret not buying six bottles.
485 2018-06-23 22:44:03 Cut Parisian Bread in half. Brush olive oil. Sprinkle fresh basil. Cut brick of Mozz and put it on. Place sliced tomatoes with cracked pepper. Sprinkle oregano. Broil in oven for less than 5 mins.
486 2018-06-23 22:44:03 You need to keep your facts straight-you are referring to 2007-8 with the Republican caused mortgage debacle-Texas didn’t go through what the rest of the country did-I am referring to 1980’s due to oil market glut that tanked the industry here
487 2018-06-23 22:43:58 Hey @davidseamanweb I know you are on the legalization side of marijuana. So I wanted to ask you....do you know anything about CBD oils? GW Pharmaceuticals is trying to get approval for CBD oil and calling it Epidiolex. This seems like they are want to claim ownership of CBD?
488 2018-06-23 22:43:51 MAXIMUM OIL PENIS EREKTION POTENZ EREKTIONSSTÖRUNGEN INTIM GEL SEX EREKTION Öl...
489 2018-06-23 22:43:47 You do realize one of the reasons why Standard Oil got so big was because they had enough money that they could get past government restrictions on the market and others couldn’t, which is directly against a true free market.
490 2018-06-23 22:43:39 There were 8 diners in the group. Can you imagine the massive tip the server lost. I'd be upset about that. Ohhhhh we're talking dim Dems....they not only have no conscience about wasting someone else's money, they think it's their right to do so.
491 2018-06-23 22:43:29 All our money goes to the MiddleEast for the oil wars instead of helping our neighbors to the south.   If we would send in help to organize their military and get corruption out of their police, we wouldn’t have so many seeking asylum.
492 2018-06-23 22:43:19 Blue Apron round one, lessons learned:
1) I need to buy olive oil
2) I need to buy salt and pepper
3) I need to buy a whisk
4) I need to buy a sharp knife
5) I REALLY need to buy olive oil
#abject
493 2018-06-23 22:43:17 Sos anyone in the city that got oil absorbing wipes
494 2018-06-23 22:43:15 Recipe for fried water:

1) use a neutral flavored oil like grape seed or canola and heat it to 350 degrees F

2) add a cup of tap water

3) burn your entire house down with the grease fire you’ve just created

4) Enjoy!
495 2018-06-23 22:43:09 In b4 someone says DURRR WHEN YOU GUYS STARTED LOCKING KIDS IN CAGES DURRR
496 2018-06-23 22:43:05 Selective grammar policing aka looking for something to bother anyone who opposes a crooked snake oil salesman setting up shop in our White House. @TomiLahren IS the disease that ails our society and the fool that @realDonaldTrump depends on for survival.
497 2018-06-23 22:42:50 No. It's given in tiny amounts, based on weight, for the same reason that people take it: anxiety, and for one of mine, to ease effects of cancer treatment. I'm in Virginia, where it's not legal yet, so I could only give my dog CBD oil, but it helped.
498 2018-06-23 22:42:50 It's hard to say. Since nothing has developed yet. By 10 I would think.
499 2018-06-23 22:42:43 Customer : I come in for an oil change and I leave with a new car.

Me : Usually happens when someone runs into me 
500 2018-06-23 22:42:40 I miss living at home where my dad took care of all the oil changes and inspections and tire rotations and all that . Not that it’s hard it’s just I’m lazy
501 2018-06-23 22:42:32 @Oil_Guns_Merica @PressSec Me thinks the left is losing their collective minds. Their righteousness will be their undoing
502 2018-06-23 22:42:10 After they had ordered
503 2018-06-23 22:42:06 Bread crumbs, Parmesan, parsley, thyme, rosemary, cilantro, and a splash of olive oil
504 2018-06-23 22:41:40 おはようございます(*^^*)
505 2018-06-23 22:41:37 So funny. Snkowflakes are now pussies. What happened to that I am woman hear me roar march?  Do you think the formaldehyde in those pink pussy caps affected their brains or are they just evil?
506 2018-06-23 22:41:31 CBD oil =/= marijuana edibles
507 2018-06-23 22:41:21 Beef is my fave, but I'm good with all white meats! I usually get my stuff without sauces too tho only bc...chance of peanut oil...and also not a fan of soggy stuff but //shrugs
508 2018-06-23 22:41:19 You can also put some cucumbers and make a dressing with olive oil, lime, salt, and black pepper. It's totally fine by itself though and it's cool and refreshing.
509 2018-06-23 22:41:07 Yes, grifters and snake oil salesmen. And that son who hurts pets.
510 2018-06-23 22:41:02 え、藝大の方にフォローされたんだけど。

512 2018-06-23 22:40:51 With an oil well to his name
513 2018-06-23 22:40:49 how about a 'boiling oil over the ramparts'.. I'll look!
514 2018-06-23 22:40:40 Sea Buckthorn oil will keep your lashes long and dark
515 2018-06-23 22:40:32 Ejo Ewa ra Adi Agbon ooo

I mean 'coconut oil'
516 2018-06-23 22:40:32 Mint. They can't abide it. Get some mint oil or make some and put it where they maybe coming in. It fecks up their scent markers.
517 2018-06-23 22:40:30 I told quez I’d give him a dollar if he put his finger in the frying oil and he did it, someone help this man out
518 2018-06-23 22:40:30 Wonder what these two words are doing in one sentence. "Snake" and "harmless". Where one exists, the other won't.
519 2018-06-23 22:40:28 Is this oil? So good

524 2018-06-23 22:39:39 No because then everything would be owned by standard oil :)
525 2018-06-23 22:39:36 #PermitPatty is an asshole, but I gave one of my dogs CBD oil during cancer treatment, and would have given edibles if they were legal here. I'm enraged by her behavior, but love the product. 
526 2018-06-23 22:39:29 You should look into the effects og the products have. 
Then you would learn that Cannabis oil is not weed nobody gets high from using the product. 

She is selling a product that helps people and animals. Why would anyone despise her for that? Ignorance?
527 2018-06-23 22:39:12 We can only hope they just destroyed their restaurant.
528 2018-06-23 22:39:12 rubs coconut oil on my brain to stop the hallucinations
529 2018-06-23 22:39:11 Exactly! It’s so fucking toxic what these Alberta blowhards are peddling! Quebec is a wonderful part of Canada and shouldn’t be demonized. It’s not like we quebecers get to decide where oir oil comes from! Merci @curler101

534 2018-06-23 22:39:00 Wrong. Obama is not null and void.  People your age will be affected the most. You will know in a year or two When your Medicare and Part D fees go up. NK still has nukes. Under obama we went down 15% reliance on OPEC.  No we go back to middle eastern oil. Bad for us.
535 2018-06-23 22:38:54 Same feelin when Bush got it in 2000.  I knew him being an oil man w the same ole trickle down economy bs would tank us. It killed the arts markets & destroyed education. Now the economy good but gas $ on the rise & will again tank us. It’s just a matter of time. He’ll blame Dems
536 2018-06-23 22:38:23 Retweeted Onye Nkuzi (@cchukudebelu):

If a malign foreign power wants to deal with Nigeria, they'll simply;

1. Block importation of refined petrol.
2. Block exports of crude oil and gas.
3. Wait for one month, maximum.
537 2018-06-23 22:38:19 It would have hints of lavender and citrus with under lying scent of patchouli oil and petroleum jelly with whisps of from under cheese
538 2018-06-23 22:38:18 Yeah as a oil fan we don't need him in the west beefing up the cali teams lol

541 2018-06-23 22:37:48 Yeah I know. We could always sell the water that England takes from us the now for the same price as a barrel of oil.
542 2018-06-23 22:37:17 Good to know - I need an oil change!!
543 2018-06-23 22:37:01 Arnica - massage oil, bubble bath, tablets and some fake tan x

545 2018-06-23 22:36:32 motor oil isnt for drinking
546 2018-06-23 22:36:29 Shitty staff sounds like.
547 2018-06-23 22:36:22 I think that's true kasi may time na nagstart ako magmoisturizer and kapag nagtotoner na ako mas madaming dirt ang nakuha ko from my face and nagkakapimple ako ng maliliit. So thumbs up from me because of my experience with it. Kaya essential oil/serum na lang ginagamit ko
548 2018-06-23 22:36:17 A spastic in it’s natural habitat. In all it’s glory. Oh and erm...Oil literally will run out.
549 2018-06-23 22:36:12 you must not understand whats happening here. US is putting new sanctions on Iran. so that means the oil production will go down with Iran halting. many countries asked OPEC to increase production to accomodate for Iran's halting. this doesnt change anything overall.
550 2018-06-23 22:36:05 Now we need to get oil drilling and mining going in full swing!
551 2018-06-23 22:36:01 Well, Big Oil needs to make a profit.  Stockholders...
552 2018-06-23 22:35:45 Oil industry is the most subsidized industry in Canada. Federal pours money directly in the corpos instead of giving it to the gov. That's the only difference with Qc. Alberta is the biggest welfare recipient of all.
553 2018-06-23 22:35:38 
554 2018-06-23 22:35:22 No, they were doing what UCIrvine students did when they took down the flag—testing the waters.
555 2018-06-23 22:35:13 I wonder when he is going to go for the Russian oil. OPEC will be unhappy. That won't be pretty. But on the happy news 41% of Americans think he should be impeached now. Regardless of party.
556 2018-06-23 22:34:58 So you shld listen more carefully. Have been many spills on that pipeline.

In any case the main problem is GHG emissions. 

We're stopping the oil by rail too.

Time for urgent #ClimateAction
557 2018-06-23 22:34:28 She would rather fry in oil with some rocky mountain oysters than admit how wrong she is. It is completely and utterly sad how demented this administration is.

565 2018-06-23 22:33:43 Got E’Lynn some new shampoo and soap that smells like “orange vanilla”  and coconut oil . Her hair and skin finna be smelling sooooo good
566 2018-06-23 22:33:40 Trump is winning for me... oer the oil prices he fought...
And the Saudis bowed deeply... I dunno, something like that 
567 2018-06-23 22:33:21 Preparing for non fossil fuel a non renewable source is the was to go - AB scared because oil is what they use however, same for all things changing one must start to diversify. Less cod and so on taking the path that's  for all not just a small group to have work and grow rich
568 2018-06-23 22:33:04 Marinated the tempeh over a few hours (balsamic vinegar, minced garilc, low sodium soy sauce, maple syrup and olive oil) and then baked it at 350 for 30 mins, half covered, half uncovered, flip at 15 mins :D it's nice and tangy and paired well w/the potatoes!
569 2018-06-23 22:32:54 I get weekly memos from the Military & Oil industrial complex, 
I recognize the situation isn't that simple, but the Volcano problem is a clear sign that change is coming. So adapt well.
570 2018-06-23 22:32:44 I do not. I know enough to not travel there. I hope the best for the great state of California. I truly do. But I'm fearful it's too far gone. Such great history, from the Gold Rush, to Hollywood, to inventing Wild Cat oil well drilling. Such a sad outcome.
571 2018-06-23 22:32:29 So you are saying if I went to Quebec and paid higher taxes I would be anti pipeline and anti oil? Sounds like I would get a free lobotomy at the boarder to.

575 2018-06-23 22:31:53 Shout out to @AlexZ19130444 for keeping the 1 man car wash going! My car is probably the cleanest it has been since I've owned it. Just let me know when you do the employee oil change!(:
576 2018-06-23 22:31:51 Include significant lowering of Carbohydrate (i.e. Sugar and Wheat) intake and stopping Seed Oil consumption in those so called guidelines, that'll be great in tackling the root cause instead of managing the symptoms. As that psychological mantra goes, "You Are What You Eat"....
577 2018-06-23 22:31:51  Maybe a pipeline is a safer approach on transporting oil after all?
578 2018-06-23 22:31:47 You won Buddy. 
Car wash, oil change, grocery shopping, set up my network (fun), massive load of branches/tree limbs to the dump, prepared the ribs. Now cocktails by the pool.

581 2018-06-23 22:31:16 my mom won’t hit my ESSENTIAL OIL MONQ PEN such a fuckin buzz kill
582 2018-06-23 22:31:10 As though oil fields aren't destructive enough. 

You know how much forest will need to be leveled to provide fuel? ALL of it. 

Also, with all available land being used to produce fuel, where do we get food?

E85, like H2, is a greenwashing PR scam. It does not scale.
583 2018-06-23 22:31:01 DID SOMEONE SAY OIL IN THE MIDDLE EAST?

♪OOOH SAY CAN YOU SEEE-♪
584 2018-06-23 22:31:00 The government of Australia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Emmy Rossum in a harris tweed wig.
585 2018-06-23 22:30:54 Avacados - excellent. If you are eating salads, make sure to use plenty of olive oil
586 2018-06-23 22:30:45 Olive oil and babounej on fire
587 2018-06-23 22:30:28 Yeah...it's a shame that you are not there for the people that need medicine like cannabis oil! 

You should remember the support you once got when your own people are suffering & you aren't interested!
The more you punish and making us suffer!! Respect your people!!
588 2018-06-23 22:30:26 The Holy Hair Oil Grail 
589 2018-06-23 22:30:02 Then the oil change guy gone say “keep it sexy”

591 2018-06-23 22:29:11 Did you leave @RedHenLex  a yelp and google review? I think we all should MAGA
592 2018-06-23 22:29:06 Gender reveal parties make me want drink boiling oil.
593 2018-06-23 22:28:59 Time to remove the tax of our oil bill and light bills!!
594 2018-06-23 22:28:51 Little local potatoes tossed in olive oil, garlic and an assortment of my fresh-picked herbs, grilled in a barbecue basket....definitely worth the carbs. 
595 2018-06-23 22:28:35 [cars 4] lightning mcqueen quits racing and begins porn career under the name lightning mcscream  releasing debut video “the dirty oil change” featuring fellow porncar, the jeep wangler.
596 2018-06-23 22:28:03 Right about now would be a good time to interview the rodeo clown.
597 2018-06-23 22:27:53 Jason, You are not aware of the discount Canada sells it oil to USA vs world price?
598 2018-06-23 22:27:46 That's like comparing the Zodiak killer to the Holocaust. Have some proportion.

BTW, Tesla's induction motors do not have magnets. Soon their batteries will lack cobalt. 

Oil will always be destructive on a global scale, no matter the technology. There is no exit plan for oil.
599 2018-06-23 22:27:39 Summer pasta salad:
On grill top, grill & cut 3 zucchin & 3peppers in bitsize bites. Grill until sold, set aside

Boil tortellini until serve able

Sauce: 1 cup olive oil, 2tsp spicy mustard, 1 shallot, 1/2cup honey, 1/2 tsp parsley. Mix in food processor.  Pour over all & serve
600 2018-06-23 22:27:32 I'm about to oil up so I can glisten like sweat on a hot summer night
601 2018-06-23 22:27:16 Idk why I impulse bought omega 3 fish oil supplements but here we are
602 2018-06-23 22:27:07 Similar to my opinion of oil (and gold too):  I am neither smart enough, nor dumb enough, to trade in oil.
603 2018-06-23 22:26:54 Or Valerie Jarrett.
604 2018-06-23 22:26:52 Oversaw opening of vast swaths of protected land and coastline for oil, gas drilling. 
Keystone XL is a blatant disregard for the environment and private property and is a vehicle for CANADIAN oil to Mexico gulf.
Comedy was fired explicitly to halt his investigation of Trump.
605 2018-06-23 22:26:47 If you don't already, add castor oil, jojoba oil, and vitamin email, all pure if you can find them. Your hair will love you for it.
606 2018-06-23 22:26:43 Kickback tonight chicken and oil on deck hit me up for the addy
607 2018-06-23 22:26:39 You wouldn't care less though if their kids had epilepsy and needed cannabis oil! 
Pretend that you care for the cameras though!
608 2018-06-23 22:26:36 I work in oil and gas and have already seen the impact of the steel tariffs and being a bank janitor isn't working in finance Mr Anonymous
609 2018-06-23 22:26:34 That's absolutely terrible..... what a joke.
610 2018-06-23 22:26:14 @elonmusk I find it so astonishing how the media is always out to get you, and Tesla. There's no doubt in my mind it's the oil tycoons trying to silence you and destroy tesla, as their scared, and rightfully so. You build the statistically safest cars, not to mention the coolest!
611 2018-06-23 22:25:47 i got coconut oil in my eye
612 2018-06-23 22:25:41 Well he got @Eminem to shut up,, just by ignoring him
613 2018-06-23 22:25:40 151-proof rum and Castor Oil.
614 2018-06-23 22:25:15 Getting an oil change  I was about to complain about having to pay for it but I’m just happy I can get one  thank you lord
615 2018-06-23 22:25:09 SANDS OIL BEHIND TRUMPS ACTIONS. THE MEDDLING IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IS A DISTRACTION. FOLLOW THE MONEY. US/CANADA RUSSIA/CHINA EQUATES TO.  YYYUUHG PROFITS.
616 2018-06-23 22:24:59 Iowa oil spill . If the United States didn't exist. There is no OIL SPILL. THE UNITED STATES ARE THE MOST EVIL THING  ON THIS PLANET.
617 2018-06-23 22:24:56 i've tried breathing steam from hot water with essential oil in it, lavender is good, lemon can be too if you have that, thyme is also good
618 2018-06-23 22:24:56 Oh the oil is only one of many many things Scotland has.......
619 2018-06-23 22:24:52 Now i understand why you think that a vegan diet is inferior.

John McDougall said since over 40 years that you should not consume any refined oil. Michael Greger, Neal Barnard and Caldwell Esselstyn say the same.
620 2018-06-23 22:24:47 Oh shoot, I don’t get it. Do you mean oil? No, probably not. 
621 2018-06-23 22:24:42 What political capital do SA stand to gain with lower oil prices?
622 2018-06-23 22:24:34 I'm old enough to remember when it was Alaska suing Exxon. For dumping oil on its' shores. Drunken ship captain I believe.
623 2018-06-23 22:24:33 Cocoanut oil
624 2018-06-23 22:24:30 Shebi I advised you live airtime and share rice you refuse? Someone cannot eat rice and keep quiet, the oil on his mouth will expose him
625 2018-06-23 22:24:17 papa g, 
please touch my love and bring your restoration, give her body new strength, health and wholeness. cover her heart, mind and emotions w/ the oil of your healing. I trust her into your care bc you love her even the more than i do. amen 
626 2018-06-23 22:24:02 You gotta try my homemade summer tomato flatbread with ungodly amounts Spanish olive oil & manchego cheese 
627 2018-06-23 22:23:03 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: BNSF: Estimated 230,000 gallons of oil spilled in derailment
628 2018-06-23 22:23:02 Brilliant move! Do it! We did and are saving a lot of money each month. Our other heat is oil.

630 2018-06-23 22:22:48 Thc oil has ran out:(
631 2018-06-23 22:22:29 Plus we would have the oil as well
632 2018-06-23 22:22:11 So I'm doing some light cleaning in prep for my dvd tower to go in that spot on Monday, and HOLY SHIT I FOUND MY OIL PASTELS AGAIN It's taking SO MUCH WILLPOWER to stay on task and not get derailed playing with those now 
633 2018-06-23 22:22:07 Olive Oil lives!
634 2018-06-23 22:21:44 Today’s adventure food...garlic scapes...flash fried in a little olive oil...sprinkled with black and cayenne pepper...YUM! #rusticroadfarm #fb
635 2018-06-23 22:21:41 My university granted us a permit to protest outside the building when oil execs held a meeting on our campus, then told us to "keep it down" because "you're being disruptive, and that's not okay."

Yeah, no. Being disruptive was the whole point. 
636 2018-06-23 22:21:37 Really? Think you've been reading too much Wangs over Bath tbh. Look around just now and tell me we're fecked. Good to see that the nats have moved on, singing 'Maggie Maggie out out' today. Shes been dead and out office since 1990. Oh and we found oil in the 60's, do keep up
637 2018-06-23 22:21:30 There is no power grab as you’ve never had the powers and if you won Indy you’d give them away in an instant with Independence to the EU - you’re all like a bunch of snake oil salesmen from the wild west - hot on claims, low on substance 
638 2018-06-23 22:21:15 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
639 2018-06-23 22:21:11 Yeah, futures rising doesn’t necessarily reflect prices at the pump which opec or any oil company controls. The refineries control that market subset. FYI
640 2018-06-23 22:21:06 Yet it was Jennifer Granholm who decimated MDEQ and soon afterward line 6B spewed 1,00,000 gallons of tar sand oil into Talmadge Creek/Kalamazoo River. #StabUsNow #JohnJamesForSenate
641 2018-06-23 22:20:52 Gotcha. But now you're land locked.  Gotta get the oil out.
642 2018-06-23 22:20:51 Not a huge difference but I take it before bed! 
I have the one with peppermint oil and it helps me with digestion. 
I also took a drug test to see if it truly does not show up and it's all good! 
643 2018-06-23 22:20:51 I think it is an unfortunate use of terminology, they should have found another way to convey the concept, this misunderstanding is used by snake oil salesmen to buy into mythology and reject science.
644 2018-06-23 22:20:51 #Canada today is what America could be if we weren't a country run by douches, liars, and snake oil salesmen...congratulations on listening to Melanie and exemplifying the #BeBest spirit that we don't have.

646 2018-06-23 22:20:38 Odd how driving was never conceived until cars were thought of and invented, and now the feeling of driving can be therapeutic to people who enjoy it. Too bad my car gets 12 miles to the gallon and gas cost an arm and leg. Fucking oil tycoons
647 2018-06-23 22:20:27 Oil did great.. ...and .. ..i'm pretty sure I made a bunch of flames fans cry today ..its been a good weekend so far !
648 2018-06-23 22:20:16 A static picture doesn't do muk justice either, every few seconds those bands of colour slide down its surface and it looks like a glistening oil slick ~ <3
649 2018-06-23 22:20:11 Not putting oil in the pan is how my sister makes her eggs and I'm always so AFRAID
650 2018-06-23 22:20:05 Maybe some of those equalization $ can be used to get alberta oil to market.  If tanker and pipelines don’t suit we could use the equalization $ to fly it to market.  # cdnpoli #AbPoli
651 2018-06-23 22:20:05 Oil and Gas
652 2018-06-23 22:20:03 Stainless steel #nameplates are extremely durable, and they can withstand the harsh environments common in the #oil and gas industry.
653 2018-06-23 22:20:03 When I say approved by professionals, I mean evaluated by physicians. And you're right, it is about education. Coconut oil can break a condom, as well cause bacterial and yeast infections. The best thing for a woman to do is probably consult her OBGYN
654 2018-06-23 22:20:02 Yes u would oil fc
655 2018-06-23 22:19:53 No worries, Pruitt changed the laws so oil in the river .... that’s no problem, no fines, no charges, ahhh just leave it there. No need to clean it up according to Pruitt’s new EPA. Isn’t this great DT voters?
656 2018-06-23 22:19:53 Yes u would cos ur a fake club wiv oil money
657 2018-06-23 22:19:49 Gee let me think. No.  The guys a more successful snake oil salesman than Clinton
658 2018-06-23 22:19:43 Come to our table at Summertime in the City at Sims Park. Give-a-aways for the kids and the adults! Plus checkout the Doterra oil table right behind us!
659 2018-06-23 22:19:43 They're from Alberta, where people get pretty weird about oil. I think it was originally a nickname for another team, the Edmonton Oil Kings. :shrug:
660 2018-06-23 22:19:22 BTC is oil pipeline project...
661 2018-06-23 22:19:15 My favorite thing about using coconut oil as a moisturizer is I get to walk around all day smelling like somebody’s about to fry some chicken
662 2018-06-23 22:19:13 Hahaha you forgot about everyone getting a unicorn all evidence shows we will be worse off this includes goverment studies. Even your snake oil salesman Nigel is trying to distance himself from it. Who's investing due to brexit?
663 2018-06-23 22:19:13 Oil and coal....innovative 
664 2018-06-23 22:19:12 Simm eu li isso, eu quero comprar aquele cleansing oil pra tirar
665 2018-06-23 22:19:07 Yeah consistency is tight. Needs to be more sugar then oil and the fall out is rude BUT overall is more natural & cost effective the buying a whole new exfoliating product. LUSH do some good lip ones also but I do like the DIY sugar one. Just 1/2 table spoons of lemon juice tho x
666 2018-06-23 22:18:58 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
667 2018-06-23 22:18:54 I’ll ask him first. Pretty sure he won’t pass up the help if he can get it, especially with all the stuff involving his wife and the white boy who looks like he used coconut oil to style whatever wig he wears (pray to god that shit gets snatched, pronto).
668 2018-06-23 22:18:25 Dear gawd looks like it is time for an oil change on that hair! EWE!!!!!
669 2018-06-23 22:18:16 Kale pro tip...
Sautee your kale in olive oil- makes it easier to scrape into the trash...

672 2018-06-23 22:18:07 This is our 2 cents spoken in two words. SANDS OIL.
673 2018-06-23 22:17:54 Price goes up whenever it wants regardless of the actual price of oil lol
674 2018-06-23 22:17:45 Rich. That is SO. RICH.
675 2018-06-23 22:17:44 Wow, I'm browsing for CBD oil for my dog and found this. I need to avoid giving her business!
676 2018-06-23 22:17:27 This is correct.  If a dude, whey and casein are the routes to go.  Whey would be appropriate immediately following a workout as it is absorbed more rapidly.  Casein at night, before bed, so your body will have protein for hours as it is absorbed more slowly.
677 2018-06-23 22:17:09 Oil say! :-(
678 2018-06-23 22:16:50 Norway with very similar oil resources & population to Scotland has a $1trillion oil futures fund Scotland has zilch. Scotland has many more other resources than Norway however there is no poverty in Norway. Time to ask why the disparity? Could it because Norway is independent?
679 2018-06-23 22:16:47 Staff take their cues from management.
680 2018-06-23 22:16:42 Ho Fund Me for the win!
681 2018-06-23 22:16:39 Another typical weasel move, don't answer the question and change the subject. The UK will run just fine without wind power, it's doing that right now during another Big Calm, it wouldn't last a week without oil and gas.
682 2018-06-23 22:16:30 You can get an Olbas oil diffuser?!
683 2018-06-23 22:16:27 Believe what you will but please stop drinking the "Idiot Oil" for you will ruin your PhD and what would you do then. It's time to cut bait or sink so since you are showing up everywhere, time to cut bait....Done!!!
684 2018-06-23 22:16:21 Do you put that gear on the scalp or the actual hair? I have got that Jamaican castor oil and shea butter. Hard to apply on every bit of scalp. Doesnt help when u are a man who can't manipulate a comb..
Your hair is on point BTW.
685 2018-06-23 22:16:15 Watching he founder of “GRAB” a company bag drove UbeR out of the south east Asian market. The tech guru started this company not long ago and today it’s worth 6 billion dollars. These are the type of stories bad inspire me. Not the one wey get free oil well.
686 2018-06-23 22:16:11 If you go to the gulf you'll still get oil on you. Went two months ago and my husband has an oil stain on his swim trunks

690 2018-06-23 22:14:57 I felt kind of bad opening up the door and these people want to talk about Jesus and im in a tight ass tank top with oil on my chest.
691 2018-06-23 22:14:55 Oil popped on my chest when I was making taquitos and a blister formed. My man thought it was a pimple and called me pimple tits all loud at Walmart. The disrespek istg
692 2018-06-23 22:14:35 This response has me close to donating but my flabby middle-agedness is distressed by your shirtless pics.
693 2018-06-23 22:14:35 I filled Nagi's Skell with oil
694 2018-06-23 22:14:33 i just covered my entire body in coconut oil
695 2018-06-23 22:14:30 It's a crafters life burning the midnight oil again X
696 2018-06-23 22:14:12 With that said unnu know seh cooking oil sell in a bag right ?
697 2018-06-23 22:14:02 A wood nymph ain't gon' be able to clean Olive Oil like Tennessee Williams will.
698 2018-06-23 22:13:54 Kathy's IQ is less than her shoe size. And she has tiny feet.
699 2018-06-23 22:13:50 I don't use toxic sunblock. Just coconut oil :) It has a natural sunblock. Unless I'm at the beach...I use some organic stuff that's basically zinc oxide. But just on the roof tomw.
700 2018-06-23 22:13:35 Hey dude! I think they look great! They could use a dark wash to darken the shadows. I would suggest something like Nuln Oil. So I’d go with that and I think that will take them to the next level!
701 2018-06-23 22:13:35 No it was great we found oil.. we put all the miners ,steelworkers and manufacturers out of work had the poll tax etc etc .wonder why Scots never voted in conservatism in them days ..it was great mate
702 2018-06-23 22:13:14 Im not sure what you're doing... It's fact that the opposition is supported mainly by the upper classes and not the majority, they're boycotting elections to make it look undemocratic, and openly funded by big corporations including shell oil who are in position to take it over
703 2018-06-23 22:12:39 Can ya believe he’s in charge of an oil rig?? 
704 2018-06-23 22:12:38 may the almighty God guide and bless you....... NAM 1 please we in Takoradi(The oil city) have waited for a branch for too long we do appreciate your good work......I am praying you listen to my plea.......Thank you sir
705 2018-06-23 22:12:26 100%. Cannacaps (coconut oil) is my current go-to. Yeah hahah if you get serious about ingesting, you can’t eat a pound of brownies two or three times per day.
706 2018-06-23 22:12:23 The business owner failed marketing 101. Sure you may not like @PressSec but asking her to leave is business suicide. Story will (derrrr) get out and those of the right will retaliate (right or wrong). Well done in this day & age of social media. 2 stars
707 2018-06-23 22:12:20 LET THIS SINK IN, CORRUPT MEXICAN ELITES  EXPORTING THEIR POVERTY & UNSKILLED TO US, TO USE US AS THEIR WELFARE SYSTEM WHILE REMITTANCES ARE THE LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME SURPASSING OIL REVENUE. DEMS ARE OK BECAUSE THEY GET A MASS OF DEPENDENT FOLK THEY CAN MINE FOR VOTES.
708 2018-06-23 22:12:17 More than that it shows a need to move away from Oil and push renewables. There's economic value in that sector too. Let's take the lead
709 2018-06-23 22:12:16 Ngl I just started using beard oil and balm and it’s fucking great , it’s so silky smoov
710 2018-06-23 22:12:11 He will probably make a deal with his boss, Putin, when he sends his six Republican Senators, Energy Sec. Perry, and Bolton to the Kremlin next week. Am I the only one freaked out by this? Going all out for the guy who hacked our election. Oil deal? Plan to fix the next election?

714 2018-06-23 22:11:48 I love going to thrift stores and when I see cameras I tell myself ‘I have plenty of cameras!’  Yes I can’t resist them and they come home with me. I like to rehab them and put them back to work. Now it’s oil paints, brushes and...
715 2018-06-23 22:11:48 Your shampoo & conditioner  & I use castor oil & coconut oil to grease my scalp .. that’s all 
716 2018-06-23 22:11:38 Was that before he was a snake oil salesman selling fake diabetes cures?
717 2018-06-23 22:11:34 Always flows down from the top. Always.
718 2018-06-23 22:11:31 And your point would be?
719 2018-06-23 22:11:24 Donald Trump signed an executive order designed to promote the massive expansion of oil & natural gas drilling in the Great Lakes & the oceans immediately off our coastlines. The order rolls back an Obama-era policy designed to focus on climate change, pollution & conservation.
720 2018-06-23 22:11:20 let me find out you be leaking like the BP oil spill. Deepwater Horizon head ass.
721 2018-06-23 22:11:13 A fabulous matinee show by @mischiefcomedy today. Loved seeing the film "A fistful of palm oil"  this afternoon - brilliantly improvised!
722 2018-06-23 22:10:58 Saudi Arabia’s discriminatory male guardianship system remains intact despite government pledges to abolish it. Third-world mentality. The only reason they are of consequence is because of oil.
723 2018-06-23 22:10:56 I think I'm leaking! Ahhhh, I'm leaking! There's oil everywhere!
724 2018-06-23 22:10:38 Oh I see.  #AlisonEttel is one of those ‘wellness’ types. 
They used to call them ‘SNAKE OIL SALERS’. 
Did the little girl get in the way of your business model?
Got me all pissed off on a Sunday morning in Australia with that twattfuckeredshittery rascim, filthy bitch!
725 2018-06-23 22:10:25 Mike - China actually just pulled back on solar, which is making panels cheaper than ever ($0.25/Wp) which should hasten the transition off oil and onto solar-powered electricity esp for the transport industry. Follow the market and $$.
726 2018-06-23 22:10:11 I love sweet potato chips. They’re also good cut in wedges roasted with  some chilli flakes and oil - done in no time. Lovely with some mayo.
727 2018-06-23 22:10:08 Trump is the PT Barnum of American politics. A snake oil Salesman & habitual liar that thrills the country rubes.

731 2018-06-23 22:09:38 Thank god the rivers all flow to the oceans so at least the oil can get to the coasts, rail is way safer than pipelines...
732 2018-06-23 22:09:22 Ah Anj you can make one yourself. Use olive oil or honey & sugar with small lemon juice! 

Good for exfoliating all round and you can preserve any leftover if you want. I make a new batch each time tbh.
733 2018-06-23 22:08:46 Big oil thanks you for your service
734 2018-06-23 22:08:45 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
735 2018-06-23 22:08:44 Cold pressed rapeseed oil - good?
736 2018-06-23 22:07:46 Idk how much it helps with active pimples but it helps scarring become less visible. I use the toner and the tea tree oil itself. Toner is more worth it imo
737 2018-06-23 22:07:45 no doubt... with all the oil in Venezuela i can't believe we haven't invaded them already...
738 2018-06-23 22:07:32 I bought an oil diffuser and a natural oil pillow spray and paired it all with my anti depressant, sleeping pill, warm blankets, sweats, and an eye mask. THIS IS ALL I NEED IN LIFE.
739 2018-06-23 22:07:23 Supposedly, soy makes men more effeminate. Something about estrogen-mimicking compounds in soy. I'm not sure if it's true, but it seems interesting that most of the effeminate, feminist girly men also tend to be pretty vocal about having a lot of soy in their diets.
740 2018-06-23 22:06:48 You can call BS all you like, it doesn't make your argument any stronger ;^). Funny how that silenced you tho, huh? Not a shred of BS here, I was personal assistant to a CEO of an oil & gas company & then spent a lot of time w/the homeless&sweatshop workers in S.E. Asia.
741 2018-06-23 22:06:42 Cold sauce pasta - chop up mozzarella and tomatoes into small cubes, mix with basil and some olive oil, let sit in fridge overnight. Next day, cook spaghetti or bucatini and toss cold sauce with hot pasta. It is delicious and refreshing.
742 2018-06-23 22:06:34 Allah tabbatar da alkhairi
743 2018-06-23 22:06:34 Only because oil prices are dropping for electric cars, so this is their way or revamping the oil industry
744 2018-06-23 22:06:32 In his talk, Matthew Zantingh opened by recalling @ALECC1 friend Jon Gordon: emotional moment, for him as presenter but for me as well. Teaching Jon's book this year, UNSUSTAINABLE OIL. #ALECC18
745 2018-06-23 22:06:14 Do not try castor oil
746 2018-06-23 22:06:11 That makes it better.
747 2018-06-23 22:06:11 Why are we allies again with this misogynistic, homophobic pile of garbage country?

Oh right, money and oil.
748 2018-06-23 22:06:06 The most ethically produced oil on the planet, and this guy can’t wait to see it shut down. Shameful
749 2018-06-23 22:05:53 Oil.
750 2018-06-23 22:05:48 Nunca pude comprar esas marcas. Para mi eran innacesibles! Solo un jean y una remera de Motor Oil en 1991 en los cuales dejé medio sueldo 
751 2018-06-23 22:05:30 Don’t read my timeline it’ll make you sick then infuriate you then realize we’re probably never going to be a united country anymore ever
752 2018-06-23 22:05:30 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
753 2018-06-23 22:05:13 Democratic fascism in action. It’s not going well for the democrats is it.
754 2018-06-23 22:05:10 damn crazy what rain can do destructive train full of oil went off the tracks spilled oil into the river because of rain
755 2018-06-23 22:05:00 Yeah leave all those existing oil contracts alone. Don’t want to upset the apple cart.
756 2018-06-23 22:04:58 Islanders killed it, those first 3 picks, Wow! When I saw Wilde went 41st, wish Oil grabbed him regardless if we already had drafted a RD
757 2018-06-23 22:04:53 The B in LGBT stands for buy oil of every pearl’s un-insides by SOPHIE on itunes
758 2018-06-23 22:04:31 men these days don’t know shit. they can’t change oil, fight, fix a sink... or nothing. all these men know how to do nowadays is do drugs and cry.
759 2018-06-23 22:04:08 Shaub and ethics is like oil & water
760 2018-06-23 22:04:07 @TreatWellHealth After today's decision by your CEO to crack down on water sales, you may want to reconsider your firm's commitment to sell snake oil to people who  have more money than sense.
761 2018-06-23 22:03:49 coanut oil
762 2018-06-23 22:03:36 I bought Coconut Butter today and IDK how to feel about it. It has the consistency or PB but tastes like coconut oil 
763 2018-06-23 22:03:31 #RedHenBigots
764 2018-06-23 22:03:25 You are very nice

766 2018-06-23 22:03:23 Don't forget the Nuln oil 
767 2018-06-23 22:02:34 Wait until the oil industry just calls it a day before campaigning for climate change mitigation.
768 2018-06-23 22:02:25 I would suggest dropping the coconut oil based stuff! Coconut oil is really good at clogging pores, especially for oily skin. Charcoal based stuff has been awesome for me, I highly reccomend it! Biore is my fav
769 2018-06-23 22:02:07 Why insults? Am i talking w an adult? (Hey, fair question) I said ORIGINALLY HE WAS commenting about oil prices earlier this month. And i sent proof. No crabbing, no insults .proof. you countered the LATER opec article.
770 2018-06-23 22:01:59 The same reason Israel is stealing Syrian Oil and the UK is turning a blind eye to it.
771 2018-06-23 22:01:55 Karen's Potato Salad Recipe:

1 Cup vegetable oil
1 Cup peeled boiled potatoes

Mix well. Eat.
772 2018-06-23 22:01:44 one day, just one. Tell our oil suppliers that we will not purchase fuel. as a nation. we do not purchase any oil, see how fast they change their prices.
773 2018-06-23 22:01:33 If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the thanksgiving sacrifice unleavened loaves mixed with oil, unleavened wafers smeared with oil, and loaves of fine flour well mixed with oil. -Lev.7:12

774 2018-06-23 22:01:23 If only there were some organization or profession whose job it was to ask tough questions to our leaders?
775 2018-06-23 22:01:17 I wonder whether she has a permit to sell her cannabis oil
776 2018-06-23 22:01:16 おはよう
777 2018-06-23 22:01:15 Depending on sales, I know Autozone typically has synthetic oil and a filter on sale for $30-$35.
778 2018-06-23 22:00:51 I'm locking the liquor cabinet.
779 2018-06-23 22:00:46 Whip together 9 tsps yogurt with 1 cup daily bread. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve with a nice chianti.
780 2018-06-23 22:00:42 Yes, it absolutely is. Yet vegans have no problem with consuming coconut oil.
781 2018-06-23 22:00:38 hahah, lol. I eventually got smart & got orange oil at the pet store, put it on all visible wires in the house.  They hate citrus and there's a bitter agent you can buy that's safe for them, put it on anything that needs it. :D Can't help you with the blinds, tho. Water spray?
782 2018-06-23 22:00:36 And she didn’t really call them out.  She clarified the facts after the staff posted it.
783 2018-06-23 22:00:28 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
784 2018-06-23 22:00:23 My typical day is like: 
Breakfast: Bacon and Eggs with full fat yogurt
Lunch: Salad with blue cheese or ranch dressing. Maybe with some chicken
Dinner: Slow cooker beef and broccoli (no starch/sugar) with cauliflower rice and another big salad with avocado and olive oil.
785 2018-06-23 22:00:21 Why did you repeal regulations against big oil drilling off the coast? Is the $50million big oil is paying you worth destroying our coastline?!??
786 2018-06-23 22:00:07 on florida soil sippin texas oil
787 2018-06-23 22:00:04 Give up oil, nobody else will, and you will live a miserable life. 
788 2018-06-23 22:00:03 A lot of people here like to dunk on the amazing atheist, but you gotta hand it to a guy who can come back from posting his “scaling oil on my genitals” videos online. Incredibly powerful poster. Many of you couldn’t even come back from a single wife email.
789 2018-06-23 22:00:01 Oil and gas contribute to New Mexico's schools through revenues and royalties, helping fund our students on their way to graduation!  #EducationFunding
790 2018-06-23 21:59:42 If Bouchard turns out good then he has the rest of the year to do something good. In the meantime, he needs to make some clever moves to get the Oil over the cap hump.
791 2018-06-23 21:59:39 I know a lot has been written in the Western media about how "evil" the Chinese are, but they are unlikely to embark on a genocide of 5 million like King Leopold of Belgium, or mess up the Niger Delta like Western oil majors.

We've seen worse, Chinese won't be as bad.
792 2018-06-23 21:59:36 What brand? I still need to try my Jamaican black castor oil mask.
793 2018-06-23 21:59:29 It is because we are fucking hypocrites.

On one hand we are ok with feeding people Khotas and chicken gut oil but all hell breaks lose over trivial etiquette mishap.

As if we are the epitome of high morality and eloquence.
794 2018-06-23 21:58:49 hahaha. I just found out on Twitter that I’m coming to ur house
795 2018-06-23 21:58:13 1. Hey @realDonaldTrump I live in #Saltillo 3 hours south of #Laredo Tx. At stop light migrant from #Nicaragua (shithole country with  dictator #DanielOrtega) asking for help Gave him 5 pesos (25 cents) like I do 4 others Can’t fix their countries (no oil, gold, diamonds) so...
796 2018-06-23 21:58:12 I love my black seed oil. It’s almost the answer to everything
797 2018-06-23 21:58:11 Trust me missy, this snake oil does miracles. Buy it already
798 2018-06-23 21:58:09 I’m impressed that you know about Herve Leger !
799 2018-06-23 21:58:08 With a last name mike douche Tom needs to settle down
800 2018-06-23 21:58:08 CBD oil is turning me way too passive. Some guy just told me I needed a ring on my pretty fingers and I didn’t tell him to fuck off.
801 2018-06-23 21:57:57 Tomatoes, mozzarella and basil dress with olive oil eat with decent bread
802 2018-06-23 21:57:55 Slice carefully with a mandolin, toss in oil, lay on a baking sheet and give them about 13-18 minutes at 180°(depends on your oven) Sprinkle with salt. Posh crisps ( or just chuck them in the deep fat fryer for about 4 minutes, if you have one. Drain on kitchen paper, salt, eat.)

I fuck your mother and sister every day and every night with durex.with oil with..red chili.....this is a freedom of speech
808 2018-06-23 21:56:22 Built our home out of an abandoned 1 room cabin with fireplace; no electricity; only heat was oil pepper wood trees ‘cuz the others were too green; an out house for a toilet..

within a year we had electricity ...no cable ...attenae & mom was an avid Bay Bombers fan ..septic tank
809 2018-06-23 21:56:20 @josie_maran Can I use the Argan oil on my 3 months old grand nephew? Is it safe to use on babies?

811 2018-06-23 21:56:11 if we had more pipelines, we wouldn't need to ship this oil by train ... if the enviro-freaks and the right-wing nuts would listen to the intelligent people instead of yelling at each-other, maybe that could get done
812 2018-06-23 21:55:57 I sincerely hope local factions take action via public protest. Lexington is in the heart of genteel Virginia so it will stay clean.
813 2018-06-23 21:55:47 I guess taking space means splurging on fivr joints and two grams of oil. Nice.
814 2018-06-23 21:55:46 I did get her CBD oil though :) that should help
815 2018-06-23 21:55:26 Also that’s extremely weird for a not so great hotel as compared to @jurysinnaberdeen to not supply a room when the downturn of the oil industry & the economy as a whole is affecting Aberdeen- I’d definitely investigate & complain s/one has stuck their proverbial nose in!! 
816 2018-06-23 21:55:24 @salmahh_yusuf any answer
817 2018-06-23 21:54:47 I love olive oil, I use it on my skin
818 2018-06-23 21:54:28 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
819 2018-06-23 21:54:04 Nothing worse than trying to put out a fire with oil!
820 2018-06-23 21:53:59 Wait until Norway hosts the same stupid party, through thorough invest they win the party. An oil country, we aren’t. But it’s pretty fuckin nice to look at PERIOD
821 2018-06-23 21:53:58 To be fair to him, not many people can come back after posting their insane “dipping my balls into scalding oil” videos online. Huge props to the guy for knowing how many people have seen his weird dick but still putting himself out there tbh.
822 2018-06-23 21:53:52 Never stopped Obama from accusing oil companies of destroying the planet. Or insurance companies of killing people. All in his official capacity at the Executive Branch.
823 2018-06-23 21:53:43 No, we hate it. You're making the rest of the men in the world look bad. 
824 2018-06-23 21:53:42 I go old school, Olive oil, a little salt and pepper.
Perfection.
825 2018-06-23 21:53:34 Organic coconut oil is one of the best natural moisturizers for the skin. If you can't eat it, you shouldn't be putting it on your skin! :)
826 2018-06-23 21:53:28 #PermitPatty was selling cbd oil for dogs?Im guessing she could be a DEM, doesnt excuse casual racism. 

Why try to escalate a non-situation into a potentially dangerous one by involving police in a civil matter?

Why did this offend her? #Entitlement built around #YTprivilege
827 2018-06-23 21:53:22 With the recent major Oil jackpot in Guyana ( which by the way has 3rd highest rate of homicide in South American) it will be interesting how many people fro neighboring countries will go there for work.
828 2018-06-23 21:53:16 I've seen him in person aswell and he indeed has natural sharks teeths of hair coming out of his face. Though! him using oil wouldn't be bad...but i'm not if he's a fan of it. He might just trim like i do sometimes with my goatee now!
829 2018-06-23 21:53:04 Republican conference questions: how do we use melanin instead of oil
830 2018-06-23 21:52:58 You certainly did from 20 January 2001 – 20 January 2009 when Bush, Cheney & Rumsfeld plunged the Western Allies into a conflagration for oil, power & money! Sadly the UK had a scoundrel as PM, Tony BLiar, AKA Bush’s Puppy, who helped create a dodgy dossier of Intel lies.
831 2018-06-23 21:52:47 They must have gone to college.

The trick is to say that you feel "unsafe". Then anything is justified.
832 2018-06-23 21:52:39 Be careful about image searches involving candles, oil, and dreidels.
833 2018-06-23 21:52:35 Didn’t you vote out the bill that protected our water here in Iowa? Sooooooo why do you care about this oil spill?
834 2018-06-23 21:52:16 It is an elitist thing.  Imported products are always seen as superior in quebec.  All we have to do is secede and they will not only want Alberta oil, they will pay extra if we brand it as le oil. Maybe something @jkenney needs to consider #AbPoli #Cdnpoli
835 2018-06-23 21:52:06 Raise US productions. Issue more leases for oil rigs. I thought we were energy independent. Fuck OPEC

838 2018-06-23 21:51:43 Yes drinking water helps your skin but it won’t counteract the hormones a teenager experiences and it doesn’t remove the dead skin build up and over production of oil that produces the acne #estheticianprobs #atleastyoustayedhydrated
839 2018-06-23 21:51:23 The ac on my car mysteriously~ stopped working and is now blowing hot air like the heater is on between turning it off and back on during the oil change.  In other news, I'm never going to @jiffylube ever again.
840 2018-06-23 21:51:22 Getting new tires and a oil change is the best gift ever 
841 2018-06-23 21:51:20 Edibles with no sugar is what i like canna butter, capsules, raw honey infused w cannabis, cannabis coconut oil, i like the Graham crackers too.

850 2018-06-23 21:50:12 my car was spoiled these past two weekends with an oil change, car wash and some nice tinted windows. So happy!! 
851 2018-06-23 21:49:53 For those who only put synthetic oil in your cars... how much do your oil changes cost?
852 2018-06-23 21:49:39 SCRIPTURE OF THE DAY :
         HEBREWS 1:9
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows
853 2018-06-23 21:49:29 Duke: And back in Washington, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to tax changes affecting oil companies, banks, and utilities that could add nearly 2 billion a year to federal revenue. GET 194:46:03; 267, plus 11.02, minus 172.03, 06.8. Over.

856 2018-06-23 21:48:58 probably similar ratio - although I think you have 12 mo or so until that ride is over where the oil bull market is just beginning...
857 2018-06-23 21:48:48 Nope!!!! Use a cotton pad to rub the Gentle Magic Lotion/Toner onto the effected Eria and then spray and moisturize with the Clicks brand Tissue oil
858 2018-06-23 21:48:38 It's part of what I do. I repair cars in wrecks. I did meet some guy today that is a welder for oil refinery, and can give me a blueprint of what to do to get a job as an inspector.  I just might not have to leave CA
859 2018-06-23 21:48:34 I dont get it, what shes doing is childish but now people are attacking weed or cbd oil? Most of you here probably take part in it. CBD oil doesnt get you high, and it can be used for humans and pets. Google CBD oil and its beneficial traits
860 2018-06-23 21:48:27 I LOVE your butter, however, I tried the soft spread, only to find it's contaminated with CANOLA OIL!!!  Why @KerrygoldUSA?  Why, that garbage poisons the pure, grass fed qualities and healhth-ness of your product, 
861 2018-06-23 21:48:19 "you tryna massage me with lotion? You ain't got no baby oil or somethin'?" 
862 2018-06-23 21:48:09 The other team on our pair had a team average of 825.  Our team average was 698.  In game 2, we beat them scratch by 3 pins.  The oil pattern was difficult for many, so who knows how well we did.
863 2018-06-23 21:48:09 TBH - if I was a prominent Republican in DC, NY, CA, etc., I'd hesitate to eat in any restaurant I didn't know real well.

The Dem's occupy and resist factions are proven spitting, pissing and shitting animals.

867 2018-06-23 21:47:23 One wag said that motor oil was not meant to be used as hair conditioner. Yes, mean, but....
868 2018-06-23 21:47:04 Two new small oil paintings, Hydrangeas in the garden, the first one is sold, the second one is available, I'll add the links to my website where you can find full description and purchase option. Thank you and have a great weekend !!!
869 2018-06-23 21:46:51 Fellas, you should definitely buy candles for your crib. Trust me on this. Or a wax/oil burner. I have both. They make a huge difference in the appeal and feel of your place

We should remind everybody that the Barret formula is a form of poverty - loans/debt at one end, while all this money flyin away..
872 2018-06-23 21:46:21 @CanadianPM Suspend all future crude oil shipments by rail from CDA to USA ?  Implement ZERO TOLERANCE ON OIL SPILLS !!

874 2018-06-23 21:46:08 With a national high on gas at the pump....kinda funny for an oil rich state...Saudia Arabia its what .50 cents a gallon at the pump...what have our leaders been doing for us?
875 2018-06-23 21:46:02 I'm not a fan. It's anti-fungal properties can destroy your good flora along with the bad, therefore altering your pH. Many folks with vulvas report BV & yeast infections from regularly using coconut oil. 
I always advocate against things that many people have sensitivities to.
876 2018-06-23 21:46:01 After a hundred years of lying, oil campaigns have finally moved forward with another smear campaign that’s even more absurd then the original.
877 2018-06-23 21:45:48 I use like this coconut oil based stuff and like a grapefruit scrub and I switch off between both and it’s just like my skin is like 
878 2018-06-23 21:45:40 A little under $200 to do the front rotors, brakes, and oil change. It’s gonna be a long day
879 2018-06-23 21:45:25 just. Make sure you have an oil based remover or oil based eye makeup remover wipes. This stuff is so hardcore that you can shower with it on and wash your face with soap and it will stay there.
880 2018-06-23 21:45:22 If Laura Ingraham represents the intellectual wing of the GOP now, someone better oil it’s joints periodically.
881 2018-06-23 21:45:22 I use jamaican black castor oil, raw shea butter, the design essentials collection of shampoos and conditions, the ndanaka hair butter, and i also do some diy protein masks
882 2018-06-23 21:45:22 Hi. Sorry but can you explain in a bit more detail. higher oil = higher inflation expectations = more hawkish fed = higher dollars is my understanding. When you have a moment, kindly explain why USD should be lower. Thanks
883 2018-06-23 21:44:58 I made pancakes and had no butter so I used olive oil
884 2018-06-23 21:44:55 The UK used and uses vast amounts of domestic oil, Norway doesn't. North Sea oil is not producing much taxable profit at the moment but should in near future. There is no oil fund, you're actually living the benefits of UK resources.
885 2018-06-23 21:44:52 Its my other ear now and I am not near any eucalyptus oil
886 2018-06-23 21:44:24 I use jamaican black castor oil, raw shea butter, the design essentials collection of shampoos and conditions, the ndanaka hair butter, and i also do some diy protein masks ..also moisturize and trim regularly, it might seem counterintuitive but it helps reduce breakage
887 2018-06-23 21:44:18 So be it. They're going to need to sell a lot more oil if they want to keep up
888 2018-06-23 21:43:54 Did he ever believe though? He seemed to have been part of the team only because of the money. E.g. Mary used an expensive jar of oil to anoint Jesus' feet, Judas complained and the bible records he did that because he wanted to steal the money.
889 2018-06-23 21:43:49 Que oil is really undefeated

891 2018-06-23 21:43:42 China Fake news; NEW YORK (AP) — Oil prices and energy companies rallied Friday after OPEC said it will produce more oil, but not as much as investors feared. While trade tensions remained in the headlines, U.S. stocks finished slightly higher at the end of a bumpy week.
892 2018-06-23 21:43:16 but I now use a high grade full spectrum oil to cope with a severe chronic pain disorder instead of relying on large doses of addictive opiates (ironic no?) It's effective, but it could be better if the THC content was higher than the current legal limit and controlled properly.
893 2018-06-23 21:43:13 Sir Stafford Cripps, David Niven, the hornsby-akroyd oil engine, Central Weekend, Debbie Dingle, Horace Donisthorpe can you hear me? Horace Donisthorpe,  your boys took one hell of a beating.
894 2018-06-23 21:43:12 cbd oil is illegal?
895 2018-06-23 21:43:08 I’m sure that the majority of them are good. Hold the tears back. They’ll probably jack up the prices and follow the oil companies and their practices
896 2018-06-23 21:42:56 hey I would just like to let all of you know I finally got my oil changed
897 2018-06-23 21:42:40 Just look at what cannabis prohibition has caused: spice, a truly dangerous attempt at recreating the effects of cannabis. But the legal cannabis oil industry has boomed over the last 24 months. It can barely keep up with demand. I stopped smoking weed a few years ago,
898 2018-06-23 21:42:22 I use jamaican black castor oil, raw shea butter, the design essentials collection of shampoos and conditions, the ndanaka hair butter, and i also do some diy protein masks
899 2018-06-23 21:42:19 More fake news to promote your agenda; NEW YORK (AP) — Oil prices and energy companies rallied Friday after OPEC said it will produce more oil, but not as much as investors feared. While trade tensions remained in the headlines, U.S. stocks finished slightly higher at end of week
900 2018-06-23 21:42:01 Oil cos don't get subsidies. They PAY royalties.
901 2018-06-23 21:41:59 Baby oil for shaving, coconut oil for moisturizing lol
902 2018-06-23 21:41:56 We are living in a world where 100% of optimism and maybe 30% of pessimism is reflected in the oil futures market - vast majority of announcements over the next 3 years will be negative towards supply (EUR's, overstated drilling location counts, geopolitical problems, etc.)
903 2018-06-23 21:41:54 If you wanna keep em strong and healthy I recommend the nail oil from Bliss Kiss! Hydrates then and keeps them bendy so they don’t snap :)

927 2018-06-23 21:39:42 Trump’s “Art of the Deal” only works as crime boss who extorts and cheats. He hasn’t made a singe “deal” since taking office. He will probably get a deal from his boss, Putin, when he sends his lieutenants to Russia next week. Perry going for oil. Senators to plan election hack?
928 2018-06-23 21:39:15 We take breaks to go camping, hiking, biking, fishing on our amazing public lands. 

Trying to enjoy these irreplaceable places before the Republicans sell them off to oil, gas & mining companies. One of our favorites is threatened by a Canadian mine as we speak  #GSENM
929 2018-06-23 21:39:12 Use benzoyl peroxide cream throughout the day and leave a dab overnight (reduces it completely or brings it to a point where you can pop it), then use tea tree oil or lemon juice to clear any discoloration. Works wonders, I’m doctoring a few before NLC, too.
930 2018-06-23 21:39:09 I just drenched myself with coconut oil 
931 2018-06-23 21:39:06 I just hope if a violent undemocratic corporate coup occurs and they kill Maduro, privatize oil reserves to sell to the US with no mr tax money raised for Venezuelan people, install a right wing dictator like el salvador, guatamala, Chile, etc that it actually works out o.k.!

935 2018-06-23 21:38:54 The easiest thing to make there is the chicken. 

Blend chillies, garlic, ginger, dark soy sauce, sweet soy sauce, sesame oil, and oyster sauce. Marinade the chicken in it for an hour or two. And then roast until it’s cooked 
936 2018-06-23 21:38:48 on each occasion Mr. Drumpf issues an executive order, a true #Christian writes a song about #love
937 2018-06-23 21:38:38 A vagina thread is also called a tampon string. That's all I can say. Well also apple cider vinegar, garlic cloves, and coconut oil will get rid of your yeast infection.
938 2018-06-23 21:38:37 Honestly I had the same thing happen with my first cutting board & I was bitter. After some use, completely stopped. Hit it with some more mineral oil after a few weeks- glassy smooth. #woodisoddandmagical

941 2018-06-23 21:38:02 Glug of truffle oil in at the end and you don't really even miss the parmesan.

943 2018-06-23 21:37:17 It could very well be the organization, but I just think it's telling that another outside organization that has every reason to want to keep Hamilton is now dumping him again.
944 2018-06-23 21:37:17 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts pumpkin seed oil with 1 part rice vinegar and 1 part miso. Add chili peppers and agave to taste.

946 2018-06-23 21:37:14 The bacon oil I tossed the spaghetti in wasn’t piping hot! I think that was the key. It was (shockingly) delicious.

948 2018-06-23 21:36:47 Standard Oil paid for it. Remember the “chicken in every pot?”
949 2018-06-23 21:36:44 Luckily I know someone very well in the Treasury (you can imagine the response!). I asked can Scotland go it alone. Said economy will go up&down as per the UK. He’s right. Oil $80, add production halved, worth $100. Forget oil. Let’s just say, he made me relax & confident!
950 2018-06-23 21:36:38 @TreatWellHealth Super huge bummer that I'll be choosing my oil from another company since your CEO called the cops on A CHILD for selling water.

955 2018-06-23 21:35:52 They really do not want lower oil prices because it lowers the value of their stock in all companies.

960 2018-06-23 21:35:26 Standard Oil did all the good? I guess we'll just have to disagree.
961 2018-06-23 21:35:24 Sure, it may all be a load of organizational propaganda, but in the case of Seguin, the stories are pretty well documented. In the case of Kessel, I agree he was was definitely slandered, but it wasn't about his social life and buying in, It was about his commitment to the game
962 2018-06-23 21:35:22 How do you subsequently deal with an oily surface? Mineral oil stains everything I set on it.

975 2018-06-23 21:33:54 How are they disturbing sir?
976 2018-06-23 21:33:47 Oh nice. I recently learned how to rub a raw garlic clove over toasted baguette. Then add some olive oil and it's amazing. Optionally add some sliced tomatoes, cheese, and deli meat as well.

This is the first me hearing that. im not saying if your right or wrong ive never heard that. I like coconut oil thats it now bye cus when did u become a hair critic 
978 2018-06-23 21:33:35 Idk about this, but drinking coconut oil and tea does it for me or eating a spoonful of it(but I can't handle that texture)

980 2018-06-23 21:33:20 My heart bleeds soybean oil for farmers who voted their racism over their economic interests when they supported  @POTUS Trump.  Lost markets due to Trump's #TradeWars really couldn't happen to a more deserving bunch of guys.

986 2018-06-23 21:32:44 Nobody. There was oil dry from K&N qualifying, and no one wanted to go out in it, so they all waited until the last 5 minutes to go out, then got mad when people were in their way.

1001 2018-06-23 21:30:47 My roommates in AZ used all of my seasonings while I lived in LA... does this give me free range to use their coconut oil?
1002 2018-06-23 21:30:43 Especially because it doesn't say oil pastels on those "crayons"
1003 2018-06-23 21:30:43 Cause it can , we have been getting conned by disgusting greedy oil old farts . Wind & solar alone produces enough electric for us all to use .
1004 2018-06-23 21:30:42 Start lobbying all restaurants U eat at. We the ppl have the power it's what we eat every day every hour! Palm oil is now killing wildlife it will condemn all of those ppl 2 nothing but strife!
1005 2018-06-23 21:30:28 No Clint, Standard Oil(and others) did. Huey just put his name on all of it!
1006 2018-06-23 21:30:18 I politely disagree here Clint, you weren’t forced to go out in the last 5 minutes, you chose too. I think the track crews should’ve cleaned up the oil dry before qualifying, but you weren’t forced to go out in the last 5 minutes, so that part is on you and your team.
1007 2018-06-23 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1008 2018-06-23 21:30:17 This right here, is all he knows how to do! Sell! The grift! Snake oil! Brooklyn bridge for sale! #MAGA, he’s picking your pockets clean... #LiarInChief #MuellerIsComing

Baby, coconut, vitamin E for cuts. Get with it
1013 2018-06-23 21:29:20 It used to be that only girls would put something on their skin, and that was just oil so they cooked to a golden brown.
1014 2018-06-23 21:29:00 bought vape pen and some cbd oil AMA
1015 2018-06-23 21:28:53 @JustinTrudeau
@swedense earns $15 bn/yr & @finland earns €20 bn/yr through sustainable management of forests. @denmarkdotdk earns $8 bn/yr through exports from wind industry. Whereas, oil spill will cost you nothing but ecological disaster & $.

1017 2018-06-23 21:28:50 So just seen cannabis oil advertised on the telly. Yup it's happening
1018 2018-06-23 21:28:46 Honey no they’re fighting other country’s wars and for oil. Not for “our right to speak” LMAOOO
1019 2018-06-23 21:28:32 Told my mom i need baby oil,coconut oil, and razors. And honestly I’ve never seen her more confused.
1020 2018-06-23 21:28:09 lol at everyone who thinks my sports massages are like fun, warm oil and candle massages when really they’re basically a test of how much pain i can endure before i tap out
1021 2018-06-23 21:28:05 And now you can cut them into cubes, toss in Sea salt and pepper, drizzle of olive oil, roast 300 until tender.
1022 2018-06-23 21:27:45 Never heard what? That it’s a treatment? Girl that oil is not to be left in your hair it way to heavy & thick it’s a treatment oil one that you warm up and wash after. Lol and coconut oil is good to but not to be outside with it it fries your hair that’s real oil you can cook w.
1023 2018-06-23 21:27:38 I really need to go get some baby oil c this lotion on my legs thing is going to kill me  feels weird
1024 2018-06-23 21:27:36 Olive oil has an amazing page with your skin and it's a very low comedogenic oil. Let me see if I can find this list I use
1025 2018-06-23 21:27:30 Sudden craving for karaage. I've never had it before but it doesn't seem hard to make. Basically Japanese fried chicken; marinated chunks of chicken in a soy sauce blend and lightly coated in wheat flour or potato starch before frying in oil.
1026 2018-06-23 21:27:16 Whatever it was, it was undoubtedly truthful. You know: Republicans and truth are like oil and water.
1027 2018-06-23 21:27:12 omg bet cause i just been putting bio oil on it! & thank you me & my sister got em matching
1028 2018-06-23 21:27:05 Suspended. I just checked
1029 2018-06-23 21:27:05 So I spray it with setting spray and rose water... the rose water helps me look more dewy but idkkk I still feel like my@under eyes be looking dry and around my nose (despite that i use eye creams)
Maybe I should add more oil in my routine before I put makeup
1030 2018-06-23 21:26:40 Hmmm what is that other round thing that can carry oil or gas. I know it’s round and can be welded.
1031 2018-06-23 21:26:27 We all ended up like herbalists that sell in the bus. We preach that water, oils and a blend of fruits of vegetables fix everything. Dry skin, treat with oil. Oily skin, treat with oil 
1032 2018-06-23 21:26:12 If this is Top trumps, I win. Had our Honda mower for 22 Years, changed oil and spark plug twice. One new blade last year. Also own Diesel Civic and a 1994 Fireblade. Honda are awesome.
1033 2018-06-23 21:26:04 We have Oil. Oh sh-!

1037 2018-06-23 21:25:00 Which only proves you bought the con man's "fake news" mullarkey hook, line, & sinker (which is his game to convince you to accept & believe only positive coverage about him, not any negative coverage). Congrats--you're now the proud owner of genuine snake oil!
1038 2018-06-23 21:24:58 @realDonaldTrump making big oil great again
1039 2018-06-23 21:24:46 Both Xhaka and Shaqiri's family's had to flee Albania because of the genocide which was carried out by Serbia. Yesterday they both score Switzerland to beat Serbia 2-1 and celebrated making the Albanian eagle gesture towards the Serbian fans
1040 2018-06-23 21:24:19 The more I read into Saudi Arabia restarting the oil field in the Saudi-Kuwait neutral zone, the more I see a swap of lost Venezuela barrels.  Again, I'm not the world's biggest expert lol, what yall think?
1041 2018-06-23 21:23:41 2nd day in a row I made bbq chicken sliders from leftovers and I’m here to say it’s super easy 
-leftover pre-cooked chicken
-bbq sauce
-slider rolls
-some water 
-some olive oil

Throw the chicken/oil/bbq sauce in a pan. Put water on it. Soak the chicken, put on toasted rolls
1042 2018-06-23 21:23:36 Includes both of us too.
1043 2018-06-23 21:23:22 Yeah I realize I was in advertently smoothing my beard with my hand while I’m driving and I was pushing oil into my pores resulting in that huge ass pimple on the left side of my face.
1044 2018-06-23 21:23:22 And that is why I would rather believe my lying eyes than the BS flowing off the wagging tongues of those fact-less snake oil shysters who speak for the Donald ...
1045 2018-06-23 21:23:12 She gets out of the car;  "Fill it up please, super, and can you check the oil please"

1047 2018-06-23 21:23:04 Russia would like to raise oil prices in any event.  Lowish prices are killing them
1048 2018-06-23 21:23:01 Better thought. Let them all come here. We annex Mexico and Central America. Plenty oil and coastline.
1049 2018-06-23 21:22:49 But it's okay when the disastrous UCP and their supporters blame Notley for an oil recession she didn't cause?

Have I got that about right?
1050 2018-06-23 21:22:34 Shameful. Well into the 21st century & native Americans still get mistreated & disrespected from the big oil owned US government. Have the Indian wars ever really end?

1054 2018-06-23 21:22:05 I was about ready to prepare my chicken but then i found out that i don't have any oil to fry it ((:

1056 2018-06-23 21:21:38 the memo i always get from the Oil & Electricity industry is always the same
"We don't like Change." but it seems untrue, because they have adapted to the change of technology better than anyone else.
1057 2018-06-23 21:21:12 My step mom just put me on Grape seed oil. I’m sold 
1058 2018-06-23 21:21:08 In the meantime they purchase their oil and gas from foreign country's in higher prices
1059 2018-06-23 21:21:06 Wrong, I’d be in a bikini, my hair would be flowing in the wind, and I’d slide in so quickly and land you’d think the slide was covered in oil

1061 2018-06-23 21:20:54 With due respect to the Bruins, this kind of thing has happened 3x with Kessel, Seguin, Hamilton...perhaps the issue may be with the organization?
1062 2018-06-23 21:20:25 The people committing atrocities in the name of our government should never be able to eat at a restaurant, watch a movie, get their oil changed or show their faces in public without being held accountable for their crimes e

1067 2018-06-23 21:19:43 What was wrong with it?
1068 2018-06-23 21:19:40 It's a workover of a previously producing well. You drill, you get oil flowing, you sell oil, you get cash. "In a matter of weeks, not months" as Steven Williams said. And if you can't understand that, you're not worth helping or responding to

1071 2018-06-23 21:18:58 As I said in a different thread, just b/c a guy doesn't fit into an organization's box, doesn't mean the player is flawed. By all means, move the player if he isn't a fit but stuff like this is idiotic. Not everyone is cut from the same cloth. Organizations need to be better.

1073 2018-06-23 21:18:52 @beynate Eastern Canada imports 700,000 barrels of oil “EACH” day. $60 M/day…$50 B/year. All that money could be supporting Alberta and good Canadian jobs. When will you stand up for Canada? BUILD ENERGY EAST.
1074 2018-06-23 21:18:35 Plus it's been 40 years since we were to run out of oil in less than 20 years. But they panicked on the oil assumption, and totally ignored the Global Warming warnings.

1105 2018-06-23 21:14:10 I'm pretty sure that, on a ounce for ounce basis, bull semen is the most valuable commodity commonly traded in the world. A barrel of crude oil, depending on the day might cost $70 give or take some odd change. A same sized barrel of bull semen would cost more than$4,000,000.00

1112 2018-06-23 21:12:18 bicarbonate of soda, coconut oil and xylitol give the best tooth paste. 
Why? Because they make a basic mouth flora in which your teeth can do proper remineralization.

1144 2018-06-23 21:07:29 I swear that gun that I carry daily for 20+ years, hasn't once jumped out of my purse or off of my dresser and shot anyone! Do I have a socialist gun?! I give it oil and a good cleaning regularly. I guess mine is just lazy for not proving Ida's theory correct
1145 2018-06-23 21:07:18 Oh and I recently started taking cod liver oil. But that’s only been about a week so I haven’t noticed much yet
1146 2018-06-23 21:07:18 Pls whats iya oni jersey handlr,need it asap @DUBBIE_HONCHO
1147 2018-06-23 21:07:17 Oh no! Dry socket is when the blood clot in the healing extraction is lost. SO PAINFUL. My oral surgeon flushed the sites, packed with gauze soaked in clove oil, and had me come back every couple days to remove and repack. It was so gross!
1148 2018-06-23 21:06:59 Not necessarily make or break, but I agree the final oil/gas flow rates for the current wells being drilled/re-completed will be crucial for #FRR and for re-estimating the reserves based on the oil/gas content of each target zone. I remain quietly confident...  will we know soon.

1150 2018-06-23 21:06:56 Rusted key. It needs oil(connection) to enter a padlock & stress/pressure (struggles) to open d padlock; if u see padlock @all to put d key
1151 2018-06-23 21:06:54 Awesome! You go, brother! I have cut the grains completely and use coconut and avocado oil. No breakfast for me (ever since spiritual discipline group), but I wish I could fight my chocolate addiction better.... :D
1152 2018-06-23 21:06:44 Venezuela produces mostly heavy oil, which can be easily supplied by Canada.
1153 2018-06-23 21:06:29 ALL. THE. GELATO. The olive oil gelato with the sugar crystals is my fave. Buon appetito, miei amici. 
1154 2018-06-23 21:06:26 Creme of Nature's Argon Oil Styling Snot is also great 
1155 2018-06-23 21:06:15 Wearing nothing but a light coat of baby oil and a balaclava.
1156 2018-06-23 21:06:04 Agreed. Celtic Nation’s need to hold on. The UK needs us as England alone has less gas & virtually no oil & even more ... no culture, no base of a society that holds other things rather than money, as essential. Something they no longer understand.
1157 2018-06-23 21:05:42 Most dangerous of all, until Russia decides they want to dominate the oil market and cuts US out.
1158 2018-06-23 21:04:54 @OOTBFish #chorlton loved the monkfish tonight. Butterflied it, then roasted on the bone high for 20 mins with olive oil , salt, pepper, rosemary & lemon juice. Finished with melted garlic butter. Tasted amazing. No faff fish - easy to prep, easy to eat - meaty fish - yum!!
1159 2018-06-23 21:04:38 V True - but Crude Oil derivatives will be used forever while that crap flows out of the ground. Big industry will make sure of it - that is why big buisness buys up patents for things like engines that run on water etc and sit on them - to squeeze out every penny
1160 2018-06-23 21:04:27 The Takes 5 oil change place in mesquite does NOT take 5 minutes. 
1161 2018-06-23 21:04:18 Thanks! I tried the Bulletproof pre-made coffees and I did notice they keep me full for longer, but their cold brew was too bitter for my taste, will have to try their oil with my own homemade coffee. :)

1169 2018-06-23 21:02:40 HEHE she is Precious even in oil painting form
1170 2018-06-23 21:02:35 I'm a sucker for rituals; I: oil a bag twice a year, shave with a straight razor, use a cast iron skillet, roast my own coffee.

I am a habit driven person; maybe what I call rituals are just inefficient habits.  I don't care though.  I like it this way.
1171 2018-06-23 21:02:32 Harris County's permit rate is down 50% from 2014, when oil prices were high, and then a small majority of permits were multifamily.
1172 2018-06-23 21:02:26 In need of a hot oil full body massage.
1173 2018-06-23 21:02:20 I’m so done with frontals tbh. There more expensive, more work, and I want to keep my edges. You can put all the oil you want on them but over time you hair gets weak
1174 2018-06-23 21:02:06 She said she’ll give me $60 for an oil change, $140 for gas, and make me dinner for two nights if I go visit? I drive a hybrid. This is no longer about seeing a female. My peepee turning a profit. I’ll be in Missouri Monday

1175 2018-06-23 21:01:58 i bet she's guzzling a few bottles of that cbd oil as we tweet

1177 2018-06-23 21:01:43 Trump's beholden to wealthy donors. These include the fabulously rich, private insurers who form cartels to fix prices, like the oil companies. He's ethically & morally bankrupt with no compassion for average Americans. Sooner you realise this is government for the few the better
1178 2018-06-23 21:01:12 With less than 5 percent of world population, the U.S. uses one-third of the world’s paper, a quarter of the world’s oil, 23 percent of the coal, 27 percent of the aluminum, and 19 percent of the copper....yep we are victims.
1179 2018-06-23 21:01:04 Good news sa mga motorista: Oil price rollback, nakaamba sa darating na linggo #RapidoHatawBalita #DZRHNationwide @doe_ph
1180 2018-06-23 21:00:59 Do you believe that "in the shitter" is appropriate as a description of the strongest economy in the country or that protests led to a massive collapse in world oil prices and to the US fracking boom?
1181 2018-06-23 21:00:46 i be mad lazy to mix up a new batch of my oil cleanser 
1182 2018-06-23 21:00:23 yep. somewhat unlikely considering the USA policy of #endlessWar all over the world, making billionaires wealthier #blackwater #halliburton #TrumpRussia #putin #oil
1183 2018-06-23 21:00:22 Gonna change my name to Richard, start an oil company and name it "Big Dick Energy"
1184 2018-06-23 21:00:22 He’ll also take a cut if any revenue it generates. 

You know he’s getting the quan from oil companies to deregulate.

1185 2018-06-23 21:00:11 June 23, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

1190 2018-06-23 20:59:40 “Hmm! Hm! Hmmmpft!”

1191 2018-06-23 20:59:39 My friends get mad at me because all I ever do is wash my hair, condition it and throw castor oil in and it grows.
1192 2018-06-23 20:59:38 Oh I did not know the oil was OK - thank you!  ...and totally agree with you on the animals over humans part as well.  I love my little four legged, but my beloved is top of the love chain...

1199 2018-06-23 20:58:41 Deregulated oil and gas in NM and the sky is still blue. No birds falling out of the sky or pollution like China has. Which by the way all the countries that are the worst polluters that air blows here in the jet stream.
1200 2018-06-23 20:58:25 Huh? Big move? A year ago after Hamonic deal Flames fan were touting the best core in the league, a year later Trev trades 44 pts away from that core.  He got fleeced.  Oil don’t need to make those “big” moves.
1201 2018-06-23 20:58:22 „He knows the oil is running out...” sweet lies^^
1202 2018-06-23 20:58:18 Lastnight I had to take care of Kira and after like an hour of promising her ice cream if she was good my cousin to my surprise asked if I wanted liquid Xanax & I was so lit about it but it was just essential oil :////
1203 2018-06-23 20:58:16 As if nature didn't have it bad enough. 30 oil train cars spilled in a Iowa river 
1204 2018-06-23 20:58:09 lamo Isn't that oil? Why did they make a ticket about oil and send it to software devs. Oil is very much a hardware kind of thing imo.
1205 2018-06-23 20:58:00 Oh my god I never knew until now that my lifelong dream is to have an oil painting of all my favorite fictional dogs playing poker.
1206 2018-06-23 20:57:52 Midnight Oil!! Really?  That's very cool.   "Hercules" is one of the best songs of the 80's.
1207 2018-06-23 20:57:50 im watching loving vincent and its amazing to me that i can pause at any moment and get a beautiful oil painting of saoirse ronan. truly this is the future
1208 2018-06-23 20:57:43 I like “data is new oil” ;)
1209 2018-06-23 20:57:37 sorry hypocracy was in protests dat used to be in 2013.,against oil prices.
1210 2018-06-23 20:57:21 It seems that it would be more nuclear energy related . Can't imagine oil and natural gas as main topic.
1211 2018-06-23 20:57:11 Most large corporations pay little or even no taxes, and many, like the oil industry, receive extra free money from taxpayers for the oil depletion allowance and many other scams.
1212 2018-06-23 20:57:11 These New Zealand players must be covered in baby oil!
1213 2018-06-23 20:57:10 Ever since transitioning ftm every time I try to buy shower shit, they got one shelf and it's all "90 in 1 shampoo, conditioner, face wash, ass wash, car wash, pet wash, just-submerge-yourself-in-axe!! Only 3 cents. Smells like actual motor oil"
1214 2018-06-23 20:56:55 Tell that to the mullahs of Iran who are always bragging about their oil power ..

1217 2018-06-23 20:56:47 Honestly I don’t know,,, I don’t do it that often but my eyebrows have grown out a lot but I don’t know is that from past castor oil or just trying not to pluck them LMAO
1218 2018-06-23 20:56:46 Dice you thigh meat. Pan sear in a little oil. If you have Sesame oil add a drop. A little goes a long way. Season your chicken with salt, pepper, garlic.
1219 2018-06-23 20:56:20 Pasta and pastry are not the same thing as I said. They are made of different components. Trying to say they're the same because of one common link is like saying Tupperware and vinyl floor tiles are the same thing because they're both made with oil.

Disney guards their IP like it’s in a medieval castle surround by moats filled w/gators, pots of boiling oil every 2 feet, archers w/flaming arrows & a fire breathing dragon circling overhead for good measure.
1222 2018-06-23 20:55:50 Harping on about Mediterranean diet and taking snippets of it, load of bollocks. Read Ancel Keys study and learn there's more to it than just olive oil and food!!
1223 2018-06-23 20:55:26 I applied lotion twice plus tissue oil all over my body but my skin still feels dry and itchy.

1226 2018-06-23 20:54:43 But what if it isn’t right ? For Christ’s sake man, Corbyn has supported corrupt and/or failed regimes/ movements around the planet for 50 years. What is it about Chavista Venezuela, oil rich but bankrupt, that you most admire ?

1233 2018-06-23 20:53:22 They use it in the north to replace oil in cooking sometimes. And they melt it in hot water and give to babies to avoid tummy problems
1234 2018-06-23 20:53:04 does castor oil actually make ur eyebrows and lashes longer/thicker/healthier?? i thought it was just a myth omg
1235 2018-06-23 20:53:03 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.

1238 2018-06-23 20:52:04 We started using CBD oil for our dog about a month ago. He is 6 and has some anxiety/ocd issues. We used exercise to calm him all these years, but he is older now and can’t work out for long periods. The CBD has really helped him. He isn’t drugged up at all.

1240 2018-06-23 20:52:01 The worst thing about this is that the governments around the world allow this to happen they could intervene at any stage but don’t bother doing so, if the country has oil every government will be intervening, sad world were money talks

1267 2018-06-23 20:45:52 Olive oil!! It sounds weird, but it works! My doctor recommended it a while back and I use it every so often!
1268 2018-06-23 20:45:29 Travis it’s fine. Agree to disagree. 96/100 times that’s I cook steak it’s salt and butter or olive oil only. Not even pepper. But for those other 4 times I like to mix it up a bit. Also the ribeye is my favorite cut of steak. Yours?
1269 2018-06-23 20:45:22 Guess it took only a few years for people to forget that when oil prices rise, they can’t afford to fill their SUVs.

1284 2018-06-23 20:43:00 he's in the lineup for a shopping spree at Trump's money tree.   @GovMikeHuckabee    Trump is about 2 things.  Narcissism and money..he has zero ideology.   Historically a Democrat until he learned that Rep voters were more easily open to his snake oil sales pitch.
1285 2018-06-23 20:42:42 What are your thoughts on lysosomal vitamin c and cbd oil for helping to treat cancers? Listened to you on @joerogan podcasts it's not very often i have the attention span but you kept me hooked.  And Joe did too I suppose. Thank you

1290 2018-06-23 20:41:36 the only think the US military is doing successful is helping saudi arabia (one of the countries with the most human rights violations in the world) destabilize the entire region to retain control of the oil exports.
1291 2018-06-23 20:41:18 fillage wit oil spillage

1295 2018-06-23 20:41:09 Glad you asked. Trump has separated a billion kids from their families. He waits until the mom is holding the baby and then he rips it from her arms. We are literally destroying the environment somehow. Trump is going to swim into the gulf and take the cap off the BP oil spill.
1296 2018-06-23 20:41:06 Study: US oil and gas methane emissions have been dramatically underestimated: UNDERESTIMAATED ? MY PHUK'N AZZ !!!! COVERED UP MAYBE, BUT NOT UNDERESTIMATED !!!!
1297 2018-06-23 20:41:00 It might be Niccola Bombacci who became a fascist in 1943 officially, but was a fascist sympathizer after abonding communism in 1936, though he didn't become a fascist by castor oil, but out of his beliefs that the fascist got the economic system for workers correct.
1298 2018-06-23 20:40:57 well I was trying to do oil slick hair and you are supposed to put the color over darker hair but yeah we lightened it and we are gunna try again
1299 2018-06-23 20:40:48 Not defending her, but that’s not true. Our dog uses a thc/cbd oil and it was prescribed by our vet.

1307 2018-06-23 20:39:41 The media has been complicit in inciting and escalating hate
1308 2018-06-23 20:39:32 Consumption of soy bean products, particularly hot pressed soybean oil started skyrocketing as a result of the dietary guidelines. And, so did diabesity. 

Correlation is not causation, but given the inflammatory properties of n-6 FAs, we could tell a convincing story.

1311 2018-06-23 20:39:28 Tashin hankali. The organizers should have at least called out this shambolic “scholar” on this. Frankly some of our ulama are not only unhelpful when it comes to gender relations. They add oil to fire.
1312 2018-06-23 20:39:22 if you're not using an oil body wash then you aren't truly living imo

1314 2018-06-23 20:39:18 OPEC meets Russia, other allies to agree oil output boost:I KNEW OUR REPUBLICUNT FINANCIAL & "OIL" CORP "KOCH"-SUKKAS wouldn't be part of it....THEY ALWAYS STEAL MORE THAN THEY SHOULD, THAT'S WHY WE ARE HEADIN' INTO THE GREATEST DEPRESSION OF ALL TIME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1315 2018-06-23 20:39:07 LOL They deserve the worst, separating chicks from hens at the chicken coup.
Then sending moms to be fried in oil, is barbaric. 
Chickenlickinciders are the worst. 

but wait hmmm Sanders? Related to the Col Sanders? OMG,
its a false flag carried out by Shake & Bake...& I helped.
1316 2018-06-23 20:38:57 If a malign foreign power wants to deal with Nigeria, they'll simply;

1. Block importation of refined petrol.
2. Block exports of crude oil and gas.
3. Wait for one month, maximum.

1320 2018-06-23 20:38:44 Hmm... Would appear that the tanker cars originated in Alberta, but the railway actually is Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF). Too troublesome to put in your headline? Or is putting Alberta oil in a negative light a better angle for you?

1325 2018-06-23 20:37:58 Everyone and never.
1326 2018-06-23 20:37:56 The US oil and gas industry emits 13 million metric tons of #methane from its operations each year, nearly 60 percent more than current estimates. #environment
1327 2018-06-23 20:37:40 Who sells oil cartridges? Not the dispensary lol
1328 2018-06-23 20:37:35 Single-handedly cratered the market for truffle oil.
1329 2018-06-23 20:37:25 Also red bean chips. They fry their chips in coconut oil, and the result is amazing.
1330 2018-06-23 20:37:20 Lol so far as there is oil di33
1331 2018-06-23 20:37:16 I was wondering why my throat felt funny then remembered my dumbass was so curious that I decided to take a hit from a weed oil pen last night lmao. I freaking coughed a lung out
1332 2018-06-23 20:37:12 So you gonna trust a retired oil guy with a jones for Assad or 2K of paleo folk

1335 2018-06-23 20:36:47 I suppose I acted inappropriately when my mother died. I didn’t strip naked, scream, and show my little bitty boobies to the other funeral attendees. In hindsight, I’m humiliated.
1336 2018-06-23 20:36:46 People of twitter with beards. What beard oil do you use or recommend? #asktwitter
1337 2018-06-23 20:36:43 Coconut oil is my best friend
1338 2018-06-23 20:36:30 Put away all my college things, fixed my closet, washed my brushes, fixed the filter on my car, changed the oil, and currently washing clothes from vacation. Ya girl is winning. 
1339 2018-06-23 20:36:05 Could you please share how you get your fries to cook like this without any oil? 
1340 2018-06-23 20:36:01 We eat salmon at least 2 nights/wk. Our favorite prep - marinated in soy sauce & lime juice (3tbsp/1tbsp) for an hour, then brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with salmon seasoning (from The Spice House). Bake for 20min @ 425. My husband prefers farmed, less cartilage.
1341 2018-06-23 20:35:55 But we’re paying more subsidy in a period of low oil price as against when oil price was $100 and still buying fuel at 145 naira and some people say buhari is fighting corruption.
1342 2018-06-23 20:35:14 Y’all if u don’t want ur car smelling like smoke just douse it in essential oil room spray and drive with the windows open. Problem = solved.
1343 2018-06-23 20:35:08 If The US would focus on their interior politics and not bombing the hell out of every country in the Middle East that has oil reserves, we wouldn’t be challenged with migration in the EU.
1344 2018-06-23 20:35:08 Right idiot. Alberta didn’t save $20 billion a year during oil boom it went to Ottawa Norway never had to do anything like that
1345 2018-06-23 20:34:53 My father drove truck for Union Oil.  Never had any stories lol.
1346 2018-06-23 20:34:53 yeah that might be the one that contains peanut oil though
1347 2018-06-23 20:34:40 Maybe, but as for house/office/motel keeping there are plenty of Americans doing it along with oil field workers that are mostly Mexican in w Tx & who get the white guys fired a lot. Lots of Americans building high ways
1348 2018-06-23 20:34:28 Small #Miata projects for tomorrow since it’s going to rain: 1. Change shift torrent oil 2. Install seat belt plastic trim 3. Install stitched leather steering wheel wrap 4. Really thorough vacuuming & mat shampoo.
1349 2018-06-23 20:34:23 My brother just gave me some oil. Good lord does that ever remind me of high school stoner days. Percs + weed + oil = very high and cozy Torrie ... this might be trouble, and painful
1350 2018-06-23 20:34:18 WTF. First time in a long time I’ve paid to get an oil change. Never again. The have even more BS add on charges now then ever and the hit ya with a $45 charge. Feel like they take advantage of people without car knowledge. Do better jiffy lube!
1351 2018-06-23 20:33:59 Going organic with your skincare? Try clove oil on pimples. Dries them right up.
1352 2018-06-23 20:33:59 You have a long way to go
1353 2018-06-23 20:33:49 Do you watch rwby?

1355 2018-06-23 20:33:38 Oooo u left me behind
1356 2018-06-23 20:33:20 Indeed. 45 also called for OPEC to increase oil production this morning; potentially leading to more expedited efforts to get this pipeline built. #MakeRussiaGreatAgain
1357 2018-06-23 20:33:11 The dermatologist recommended cetaphil oil control facial wash & stridex pads (the green ones are good for sensitive skin) have changed my life! Also seeing a dermatologist is a great idea. They put me on an antibiotic and my skin hasn’t looked this good in 8 years..
1358 2018-06-23 20:33:04 Better choose one of the connections and marry
1359 2018-06-23 20:32:38 It’s so warm in my apartment (even with the a/c on) that my coconut oil is a slush, instead of solid. Tho I guess I should be glad it’s not completely liquid yet. 
1360 2018-06-23 20:32:16 Heheheh don’t be Jel-Usu.... I have good people in my life 
1361 2018-06-23 20:32:13 Just detailed the car and changed oil filled my windshield wiper fluid
1362 2018-06-23 20:32:12 I wish I could pull off cute dewy looks instead of being a bloody oil slick.
1363 2018-06-23 20:32:04 American cars have improved to be sure. But my 2010 Hyundai Genesis has only needed tires and oil changes. My pal's 2010 Caddy is in the shop about every six months. I lend him my 91 Toyota MR2 with 400K miles, haha.
1364 2018-06-23 20:32:04 That looks like pure chili oil. Was it good?
1365 2018-06-23 20:31:35 Lol 
1366 2018-06-23 20:31:25 It’s very sad that the President if the United States makes up petty nicknames and outright falsehoods rather than trying to actually help. You foment chaos and call it strength. Snake Oil through and through.
1367 2018-06-23 20:31:07 Heyyy, here’s an idea  let’s make bio file out of canabis oil. Maybe save the environment a little, forget about fossil fuels and! And fill in those bare patches from deforestation projects and get clean air to breath to boot. Bam  major issues solved 
1368 2018-06-23 20:30:54 never had it but i'm not accepting a beverage that looks like oil and doesn't know whether it's a beer or cider in the same chat as champion beer

1370 2018-06-23 20:30:39 Because heaven forbid we build a pipeline that's monitored doesn't move and the safest way to transport oil and eliminate rail traffic that creates environmental hazards and burns down cities in Quebec
1371 2018-06-23 20:30:35 if you don't believe that the Military & Oil Industrial Complex is real, then you don't really know much about how anything in this world works.
1372 2018-06-23 20:30:31 Are u always connected,are u a WiFi? Well lemme enjoy
1373 2018-06-23 20:30:29 So I can't find any olive oil hut I did find .357 ammo
1374 2018-06-23 20:30:03 TIL Peppermint oil promotes hair growth more than hair growth medication
1375 2018-06-23 20:29:55 Is there anything better than removing makeup and wearing bio oil on your face?

1380 2018-06-23 20:29:02 Hehehe...Olive oil must be environmentally friendly....
1381 2018-06-23 20:28:56 There were flights like that to Aberdeen and I think also Norwich for the oil industry.
1382 2018-06-23 20:28:47 In a just world, Nigel Farage would be hung by his heels and boiled alive in burning oil.  #Brexit #Trump #Remain
1383 2018-06-23 20:28:44 This is the worst kind of demagoguery.  He intends to fuel hatred of immigrants. Especially brown ones. He is a monster and I'm pissed these families were taken in by a snake oil salesman
1384 2018-06-23 20:28:20 IMAGINE the world we might live in if the West's interest had been #HumanRights in the MidEast instead of cheap oil!

@CNN @Foxnews @WSJ @UN
1385 2018-06-23 20:28:17 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
1386 2018-06-23 20:27:54 weird. The Oil picked another family member of staff. Hopefully he turns out great
1387 2018-06-23 20:27:45 Pastor is worth millions. He needs more than oil to keep him safe!

1391 2018-06-23 20:27:33 Go coconut oil, its medium chain fatty acids are less likely to be stored as fat by the body.
1392 2018-06-23 20:27:16 I'll still say ehhhhh
1393 2018-06-23 20:27:06 i love the revolution one called oil control tbh
1394 2018-06-23 20:27:00 It’s for someone else. They’ve taken their car to get an oil change before and was turned down because it was only 80%. The car only gets driven 5 minutes at the most, literally every week day 
1395 2018-06-23 20:26:49 What if reverse was d case,what would your response be
1396 2018-06-23 20:26:47 I started using that one for bout 2 months fr it’s great, the Jamaican caster oil put it over the edge tho it just took a while for me to@get used to the smell
1397 2018-06-23 20:26:41 US negotiators didn't negotiate very well; our export/import balance is negative for years, even now as our oil imports and the oil  prices are down. The system does not work. Maybe Trump appreciates the obvious. I'm for balanced trade not a  trade war. What's your resolution?
1398 2018-06-23 20:26:27 My instinct kicked in the moment I saw this giant ass false widow spider hiding in the window frame. 4 egg sacks, and little old me with a bucket of bleach and tea tree citrus oil spray ready. Three hours later and I’m still cleaning, but with less tears right now..
1399 2018-06-23 20:26:09 It happened to Biden & you didn’t care
1400 2018-06-23 20:26:00 Oil. North Korea. Bet on it.
1401 2018-06-23 20:25:44 Ha, that is impressive! My last adventure was discovering the oil pressure valve on the Jag had a tiny chunk of rubber stuck in it holding it open and completely screwing up my oil pressure. Good times.
1402 2018-06-23 20:25:28 No. But I’m sure it works. The oil is just basically used so you don’t waist  it. Easier to control dose. You could eat the whole gram. Won’t hurt you. Good luck
1403 2018-06-23 20:24:49 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.

Thank me later & stay cool on this hot Summers day. 
1406 2018-06-23 20:24:25 hands down the oil pen changed my life
1407 2018-06-23 20:24:10 so i've been thinking about something... if olive oil is made out of olives, then baby oil is made out of,,, babies? man oh my god what is the truth
1408 2018-06-23 20:23:50 just fried off some rice in sesame oil and now I feel like a master of Asian cuisine
1409 2018-06-23 20:23:46 Update: The Mighty Ducks is cheesy as hell and oil changes should not take this long or be this expensive.
1410 2018-06-23 20:23:41 She owns @TreatWellHealth - buy your chill CBD Oil somewhere else because apparently it's not working for her.
1411 2018-06-23 20:23:11 Western nations should be pressuring the governments of Muslim nations to liberalize the rights of their citizens and allow them to share in the oil riches so they could stay at home w/ a good life
1412 2018-06-23 20:22:58 Wow.  Your useless dribble shows you know absolutely nothing about science.  Still waiting on your evidence of violated permits in oil & gas.  Go ahead, I’ll wait.
1413 2018-06-23 20:22:54 They are not going to like the new rules
1414 2018-06-23 20:22:52 I have this lavender oil I’ve just been just dying to rub on someone’s body lol.
1415 2018-06-23 20:22:44 Come to my house - the cat brings them in, alive, by the shedload and lets them go. Spent a small fortune on chomped electric wires, carpet and a £4K oil boiler. They eat anything! I catch them with Green and Blacks and a beer glass when I can.

1418 2018-06-23 20:22:26 I would love the pet oil for our dog’s legs and the gummies for my migraines.
1419 2018-06-23 20:22:20 And they have succeeded in diverting the attention frm why they increased NASS budget w/o consultation. Only reason given is dat we made more money from oil than projected.We were told the Exec couldn’t spend frm the ECA but NASS have shared money that shld hav gone into ECA.
1420 2018-06-23 20:22:10 US, UK and France are the warmongering nations with oil interest creating these problems, and that's why the French have been a primary terrorist target....
1421 2018-06-23 20:22:08 pro tip: if youre low on oil just buy a longer dipstick so it can reach it
1422 2018-06-23 20:21:54 Oil spots can be removed from clothing with Talcum Powder.
1423 2018-06-23 20:21:46 Mad ps to be made out there. Fishing and oil industry. Niggas getting paid $30-40/hr

1425 2018-06-23 20:21:06 I really need friends .. Im getting bored of bullshitting with the guys at work about oil field shit I dont even understand
1426 2018-06-23 20:20:57 Zoom (My car for those of you who don’t know) is all full of oil and happy again ^.^

1429 2018-06-23 20:20:38 Have you found the MCT oil is making a difference? Been using Collagen Protein powder in mine, my skin looks great, but doesn’t seem to help my brain.
1430 2018-06-23 20:20:30 the Pound Stretcher @ gateway has/had beard oil? 
1431 2018-06-23 20:20:14 Please provide the analysis that supports your claim. You completely ignore any sense of context. Is it possible that offshore oil with tidewater access is more profitable than Alberta oil? Do you deny AB is a net contributer to Canada? Please show your work.
1432 2018-06-23 20:19:12 @CNN @MSNBC This Canadian thanks u for focusing on the plight of  #ImmigrantChildren #HumanRights & #InternmentCamps in the #USA, leaving ur (dear?) leader's rally to air where it belongs on a (shopping? marketing? propaganda?) network of the sort appro for a snake oil salesman
1433 2018-06-23 20:19:05 I dont know
1434 2018-06-23 20:19:02 What is XRN? Snake oil?
1435 2018-06-23 20:19:00 President must impose a 35% remittance tax to all US remittances going to Mexico. The first source of Mexican economy income are US remittances above oil, mining, agriculture, etc.
Mexico can't survive without US remittances.
IMPOSSE THE TAX, USE THE MONEY TO BUILD THE WALL.
1436 2018-06-23 20:18:58 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。

1440 2018-06-23 20:18:24 I feel like a basket of Mcdonalds fries that's been left in the hot oil overnight. But that crystal is cool

1444 2018-06-23 20:17:47 What's your favorite oil to diffuse in this fun on-the-move diffuser? 
1445 2018-06-23 20:17:37 Always amazed how @theSNP & Yes movement has allowed the Unionist Interest to turn a massive national oil industry into a negative at worst, cringe at best. With Brexit and collapse of foreign investment Scotland’s oil the only collateral England/UK has left. Think about it #Yes
1446 2018-06-23 20:17:37 I love the smell of tanning oil
1447 2018-06-23 20:17:31 Incorrect. The link starting this discussion thread is to an article regarding Quebec’s announcement that it won’t even develop its own oil and natural gas resources. 

Fine. But let’s not keep subsidizing Quebec’s disinterest in developing its own economic capacity.

1451 2018-06-23 20:16:45 #wti #crude #natgas #oil $UWT With all of the market-moving news in the oil complex, what is everyone's thoughts on the WTI Crude Oil open on Monday?
1452 2018-06-23 20:16:33 I mostly agree, but I’d caveat that just a bit. Complete disregard for the truth goes against promoting science. You come away thinking NASA is just high minded people who can’t get anything done (compared to oil drillers). The Martian and Deep impact do a good job imho
1453 2018-06-23 20:16:29 Right lmao and it’s taken like over 6 months to even reach 50%  so i KNOW getting an oil change is nowhere near mandatory right now.
1454 2018-06-23 20:16:29 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
1455 2018-06-23 20:16:19 Iran sees little extra oil if Merchant Navy, partners stick to deal
1456 2018-06-23 20:16:04 Oil and styrofoam also rise to the top.         I don’t hate Sarah Huckabee Sanders; I hate that she parrots the President’s lies and comes up with her own as well in her official role and public duties.  If she hadn’t publicized the restaurant most people wouldn’t have known it.

1460 2018-06-23 20:15:30 @MyNykaa Guys the hair oil you delivered today smells burnt :/
1461 2018-06-23 20:15:13 Once sliced, take paper towels and pat them dry, and place them on a bed of paper towel to soak up remaining moisture. Apply a thick coating of batter once oil is hot and drop four to five slices in at a time. When the bottoms are golden, flip and let the other side cook.
1462 2018-06-23 20:15:02 200 yrs of our history - war. We bomb mostly oil nations not so much for the oil but to save the petro $ so we can borrow cheap money to fight more wars. All of this is to profit the MIC. We fight proxy wars.
1463 2018-06-23 20:14:49 Liberals have the ethics of snake oil salesmen... and the greater public are just stupid, blind, or gullible enough to re-elect them
1464 2018-06-23 20:14:43 @CWHemp i have spent $1000s on your cbd oil and i think you guys should do the right thing and send me a bottle that is not just olive oil.i have got the chocolate mint and i don't like that one
1465 2018-06-23 20:14:39 Pure oil tanker.
1466 2018-06-23 20:14:39 Many of the oil change places do AC service now, so they can test and refill your freon for you. It makes a huge difference.

When you get people around to the idea that it’s about policy, you find there is no red-blue divide. People want a govt that represents them. Not Big Oil, big Pharma, healthcare lobby.....

1478 2018-06-23 20:12:43 They're usually the last ones who want to take a class from what I've seen
1479 2018-06-23 20:12:40 Of course! Like a wok which is seasoned by the oil, seldom sees water and then is dried thoroughly lest it rust.
1480 2018-06-23 20:12:32 Were you not entertained? Yes, we were! That 95th minute goal by Germany was amazing! Did you know that many active sportsman use #hemp oil to overcome injuries, stress and anxiety? #HempOil #WorldCup2018 #GERvSWE
1481 2018-06-23 20:11:55 Right. To me mileage has nothing to do with it but oil life does and 50% is too early to get an oil change lol I’m trying to get this through to somebody’s head
1482 2018-06-23 20:11:46 Pence? Shit, if the left keep up this insanity it’s gonna end up being President Lewandowski or Gorka.
1483 2018-06-23 20:11:30 I'm saying a small population, oil rich country will be able to save more money than small oil rich province which is part of a system which redistributes wealth among a population 7.5 times it's size. Not that complicated. People who push the Norway narrative ignore context.
1484 2018-06-23 20:11:25 price of OIL is up, price of gasoline is up - i am willing to wager that is a greater household budget item than utility savings
1485 2018-06-23 20:11:25 Technically they kicked her out for being the Press Secretary for our President. So it’s fitting for her to use her work Twitter #IMHO.
1486 2018-06-23 20:11:22 Taylor Swift's silence on oil purchase is deafening
1487 2018-06-23 20:11:14 I've realised I haven't really been taking care of my hair. I don't sleep with my bonnet anymore .

My hair is so dry, needs some oil. And then when it breaks I'll also complain.

Haircut maybe is what I need since I'm being childish

1495 2018-06-23 20:09:58 If your pizza wasn't so filled with oil dripping out of it and didn't taste like a mouthful of vegetable oil you could get more than $5.99 but take it from a pizza lover, not good pizza
1496 2018-06-23 20:09:53 Ze Germans put some oil in the machine??!

1498 2018-06-23 20:09:38 try $5.06 a gallon ($1.32 a liter x 3.78 liters to a gallon)...and 95% of the freeking oil used to turn it in to gas comes from Canada...absolutely ridiculous...

1501 2018-06-23 20:08:59 You can’t go back home. Love Ford is now a brewery. When did that happen?  Beer instead of oil changes and a lube???
1502 2018-06-23 20:08:58 So when it hits 50%, it’s time for an oil change?
1503 2018-06-23 20:08:42 2. Trillions of dollars in welfare to corporate welfare queens - banks, oil, coal, electricity, prescription drugs, Comcast, etc.  Pollution from coal and oil increase health care costs by trillions of dollars over time.
1504 2018-06-23 20:08:19 bigotry has no party. Both are wrong

1507 2018-06-23 20:08:14 if U.S. pushed Saudi to pump more on Iran, assume they also asked to boost U.S. exports
probably why Saudi EIA avg import figures been rising
Trump wants stocks  prices 
fact that oil jumped friday not a Falih victory. Trump did his end of bargain Bin Salman will do his
1508 2018-06-23 20:07:59 It's not weed for dogs, it's CBD oil for pets.  They sell cannabis tinctures for people.  Let's not give the industry a bad name because of her.
1509 2018-06-23 20:07:55 Done working in Iraq. Working stateside now for a oil and gas company. Kormi had to stay in Iraq but hopefully we’ll be reunited again someday.
1510 2018-06-23 20:07:47 Buying a brand new car was/is expensive but best investment ever !!  I drive an average of 600-700 miles a week maybe more, so the maintenance is often but with the warranties I don’t pay for nun. Just got my oil change, alignment & rotation with inside detail 
1511 2018-06-23 20:07:42 You want a list of patents filed in Alberta for oil and gas technoligies?  
I'm unsure why you would push the narrative that Alberta doesn't deserve what is has. You know people can be lucky (have resources) but also work to de Elop them, right?
1512 2018-06-23 20:07:23 Yeah mine too ... or was it cod liver oil she used to spoon feed us with in those days 
1513 2018-06-23 20:07:12 I haven’t heard about this on the news. This is terrible! They tell you not to drive through flood water, so what idiot thought it would be okay to drive an oil filled freight train through a flooded field? 
1514 2018-06-23 20:07:10 It really isn’t hard to change your own oil or even know the simple terms as “top off liquids or type of oil” when you’re at an oil change shop. 
1515 2018-06-23 20:07:07 Basically it's ok to voice your objection just don't be so vocal about it. Hilarious

1537 2018-06-23 20:04:13 The largest current market for our oil is the Gulf Coast. They do not have reduced demand for Canadian oil as a result as their demand is for heavy oil which their refineries have been updated to process. The increase in domestic oil production lead to US light oil exports.
1538 2018-06-23 20:04:08 And beard oil...  There's a whole beard care range

1540 2018-06-23 20:03:59 Steps for getting your car’s oil changed as a woman:

2. Confer with female friends on how they were previously scammed/upcharged 

3. Learn how to do it your damn self

1550 2018-06-23 20:01:50 Africa has 2 female billionaires. 
One made her money when she got an oil block from the govt, and the other when she got the national oil company to run from her father.

China has 64 female billionaires.
They made their money building companies in tech, retail and real estate

1553 2018-06-23 20:01:31 It’s an oil change place not a gas station
1554 2018-06-23 20:01:28 Absolutely unbelievable what can be achieved with the right planning and team approach. These videos are excellent and should be promoted as tools to get the next generation of engineering talent to the oil industry.

1570 2018-06-23 19:59:38 They're insane
1571 2018-06-23 19:59:35 Huh?  Selling Canada’s Gay friendly oil to one buyer, USA at a 40% discount off world prices is causing budget shortfalls. Canada should sell its trade goods at the highest price. That way you can continue to enjoy free health care.

1577 2018-06-23 19:59:11 Bigger than oil. Drugs. Everything. Because data is copied, not consumed.
1578 2018-06-23 19:59:10 2 million bbls per day of oil production from Bitumous sand. That's the technological marvel Gail's denies. 90% of which will ultimately be recovered by high tech non-mining technology. Not sure why she needs to push the narrative that Alberta is just lucky.
1579 2018-06-23 19:59:07 Oh it is! Same as last year! Nice & central yet very quiet & out of town!
Back killing after the driving 200 mi. Hospital pharmacist called me, discussed the oil. Not entirely happy as it is renal excreted!  So will push for some other drugs for me when she's back in a week!
1580 2018-06-23 19:59:03 I’ve done MCT and coconut oil before too. It just tastes better with butter.
1581 2018-06-23 19:58:53 Burned myself with oil but at least I got a cool red teardrop on my chest
1582 2018-06-23 19:58:52 Or how about the enviro practices of Cuba? Oil wells amongst residential neighbourhoods drilling horizontally from land into the ocean? Not a Peep

1590 2018-06-23 19:57:56 Oil painting "ugly" is awesome, though it doesn't need to be hyper realistic with details at all, because the painting ugly is an artist's impressionism and feeling.

1597 2018-06-23 19:57:20 You put the oil under your tongue and let it sit there for 30 seconds and then swallow it.  Doesn't taste good but definitely not horrible.
1598 2018-06-23 19:57:17 Ntah mana la aku letak tea tree oil aku tu....

1601 2018-06-23 19:57:08 @CWHemp my name is joshua mullins from columbus ohio i just bought  a bottle of your everyday olive oil cbd hemp drops from columbus botanical depot
1602 2018-06-23 19:56:54 Kroos don oil am. What a goal!
1603 2018-06-23 19:56:40 Get the gram powder. @ cbdistillaries. Just dip wet pinky in and put in mouth. 2 times a day. $30/gram. It will let you know if it will work for you in a couple days. Can let you know how to make your own oil later. I could barely walk and now no pain.
1604 2018-06-23 19:56:37 Do you think that it's safer for oil to travel by rail? Rail is not safer and the fuel for train is polluting the air. At least with a pipeline, the exhaust from the train is eliminated.Also, Asia is going to get oil somehow, why can't it be responsibly from Canada? #pipeline

1608 2018-06-23 19:56:27 No news after all this time usually means good news eventually; the oil & gas has been found, supported by good gas pressures and with statements of commerciality. Can’t fault #FRR for their working to a detailed plan, to prove up the resources for each zone.

1621 2018-06-23 19:55:01 Not high at all look at the cabinet Wilbur Ross makes millions shorting a stock Pruitt is stealing and abusing the EPA office and today a major oil spill in Iowa on a river. Devoss hires security guards and is very nasty trump is the biggest thief and conman flying to mar a largo
1622 2018-06-23 19:54:57 I’ve only ever known 2 Iranians and I’ve got to say the were sound as a pound . Both highly intelligent gents , The British stole their oil back in the 50’s and totally destabilised Iran . UK were good buds with Saddam Hussain in the 80’s hence why we tooled him up . 

IRAN
1623 2018-06-23 19:54:52 Oh nice!  I use Moroccan oil and that works wonders until I discovered Brazilian Blowouts!  You should look into it. I would beg, borrow and steal to have had one when I was in high school. They are truly amazing. I don’t have a frizzy hair on my head anymore!
1624 2018-06-23 19:54:38 Plus they use peanut oil in all their food. So anyone with a deadly food allergy screw them. But LGBTQ  is important too

1629 2018-06-23 19:53:14 You are able to read @zendette? Iran/Hezbollah are at Isreals borders for more than 30 years. Its all about Israel/USA stealing syrian oil from the illegally occupied Golan! Like they are doing at the sea zone belonging to Gaza (Palestinian oil).
1630 2018-06-23 19:53:14 #Oil went up on #markets since only 600,000 is going to get shipped. Must be pissing off @realDonaldTrump #idiotinthewhitehouse since he wanted more to keep the price down.
1631 2018-06-23 19:53:10 うへぇ！
1632 2018-06-23 19:52:46 bra tweet for de to som vet hvordan vokalisten i Midnight oil ser ut
1633 2018-06-23 19:52:41 There are @ 170K jobs in the offshore oil extraction/production business.
Comparatively,
There are @ 130K jobs in fisheries, fishing fleets, and other live prod. businesses.
There are @ 2.2M jobs in the tourist business in ocean comms.

Trump puts oil companies ahead of jobs.
1634 2018-06-23 19:52:36 Let them cut the oil supply all they want. I wonder how long Russia's economy can sustain it.
1635 2018-06-23 19:52:21 It’s a Canadian and USA problem. Salmon are not just in BC waters. This is the thinking on many things. Oil tankers and salmon. US has 3 times the oil Tankers, but Canadian cannot increase theirs. We have to do something about our salmon, but how much are the US doing about it
1636 2018-06-23 19:52:15 1. @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo as Dir @cia gave Russia & Iran the Kirkuk Iraq oil & gas fields. Manafort's last job I think was getting @masoud_barzani to betray his own people. Bet he just took more cash. Now @KremlinRussia_E commands stooge @Trump to summit to finish Iranian
1637 2018-06-23 19:52:06 Yea I got some prescribed rash creams but they never worked... Iv been using the aveno and it’s help but sometimes on his arms it won’t go away so I might try that or coconut oil

1644 2018-06-23 19:51:12 I think there was an entire season of Oil Change devoted to Hordichuk.
1645 2018-06-23 19:51:10 So in summary, the only key differences between oil insustry non-refundable tax credits and those for consumers buying/leasing an EV is that the oil subsidies have no policy rationale and they are unlimited in scope/time.
1646 2018-06-23 19:51:05 ah yes, tweeting your hope for cheap imported oil is probably a much more effective move as president of a developed nation than, say, investing in domestic renewables. keep up the good work
1647 2018-06-23 19:51:03 @RAYGUNshirts can we get a shirt design for the oil spill and floods up in NWIA ?
1648 2018-06-23 19:50:59 But what exactly are they doing with it?  They are not cutting red tape that bars us from effeciently getting things done but rather rolling back protections so that banks can more effectively screw us over, or big oil can pollute water systems more without oversight.
1649 2018-06-23 19:50:59 I need a person who can do oil changes for me and not charge $100 
1650 2018-06-23 19:50:48 We have got to quit being so dependent on oil and move to make cleaner sources of energy more viable and mainstream. This is ridiculous
1651 2018-06-23 19:50:41 So much negativity, envy and jealousy on this app,tirr da mahassada...
1652 2018-06-23 19:50:36 Then explain Bezos, Trump, the oil execs, the climate change deniers, the NRA... 

the people complaining that Sarah Sanders got asked to leave a restaurant even though THEY should never have to serve the gays... 

Step away from micro. The problem is macro.
1653 2018-06-23 19:50:26 Then you clearly don't understand democracy. It can change it's mind and admit it was wrong. Brexit supporters hide behind a facade of democracy when really they either can't admit they were wrong or ignorant of EU or duped by snake oil salesman. Still waiting for one good thing.

1669 2018-06-23 19:48:37 Actually, they are not diff. An oil company spends its income a certain way, & can then take a NR credit, & the consumer chooses  with their income, but spends on an EV.The same. 

Only differences 1) policy rationale supports the EV tax credit 2) they are limites to 200k per OEM
1670 2018-06-23 19:48:27 Sure. Melted chocolate. Fondue Bourguignonne is more like Shabu Shabu, where it’s hot oil or broth.

But generally? Cheese.

1672 2018-06-23 19:48:00 Hi Lisa,
Thanks! Had to do my research on the paint... it’s from amazon. After watching YouTube vids on how to make, I used the same paint as others used which was ‘fabric glow paint.’ The stuff from BnQ is water based I think they said, or was it oil based? Either way would..
1673 2018-06-23 19:47:51 of attire. I wiggle some more, eager for his hands on me. And perhaps a small part of me is teasing him.] If I knew I was going to see you, I wouldn’t have worn any.

[My body tingles as he straddles me and when he places his hands upon me, warm from the oil, I moan as if he’s +
1674 2018-06-23 19:47:43 Overall I would say olive oil is somewhat better. It has high amounts of monounsaturated oil and a better overall balance of fatty acids. Coconut oil is more stable and better for cooking. Although olive oil is fine, too. I personally go with olive oil for taste and nutrition.
1675 2018-06-23 19:47:41 I already forgot the times when I traded Fundamentals on oil)
1676 2018-06-23 19:47:19 Come on, who wants players that are seemingly interested in things that could possibly broaden one's horizons.
1677 2018-06-23 19:47:16 We don't need foreign oil. We should be self suficient, not dependent on foreign resources.
1678 2018-06-23 19:47:14 Toss 'em a bottle of baby oil and watch 'em giggle.
1679 2018-06-23 19:47:07 Changed my own oil, brakes, rotors, calipers and air filters today. I’m feeling accomplished af lol.
1680 2018-06-23 19:47:05 Definitely Palm oil that was used on these German machines.
1681 2018-06-23 19:46:45 And while you're at it, restore door to door delivery service. Maybe after clean drinking water or every community is established but before first past the post elections are eliminated and sometime around when you get to ending oil and gas subsidies.
1682 2018-06-23 19:46:39 If you’re ever in Canada getting your oil changed @mrlube make sure you double check when your air filters need to be replaced. Just got the hard sale when the book said mine is good.
1683 2018-06-23 19:46:38 The beer, wine and oil are to your left. Help yourselves!

1698 2018-06-23 19:44:38 Martin Truex Jr. said it appeared NASCAR didn’t have the equipment to clean off the track, which is why it was still dirty to start quals. Said only way to clean it was to run cars over the oil dry.

1713 2018-06-23 19:42:20 Never mind the price of OIL... start worrying about the price of JACK DANIELS !!
1714 2018-06-23 19:42:17 See heres the thing... these countries ARE beautiful wealthy nations with oil gold silver and other resources. Why can’t they make a future there? Because of corrupt leaders, cartels and elitists who could care less for them. Fix their country so they CAN have a future there!
1715 2018-06-23 19:42:15 And if you could find a space on the bar for a Gamma Ray or Neck Oil I would be frankly delighted!  @BeavertownBeer (But also delighted you will be serving @SirenCraftBrew !!)
1716 2018-06-23 19:42:11 Black currant oil is extraordinarily high in vitamin C and is also rich in many other nutrients. It can greatly ease breast tenderness.

1730 2018-06-23 19:39:25 With the Edmonton Oil Kings selecting second at next week import draft. Hard to think that Oilers 7th rounder Patrik Siikanen, a Finnish Forward who spent last season in SM-Liiga isn’t on there radar. #OilKings @TPS_Guy
1731 2018-06-23 19:39:19 so i cant ever go on any birth control pill cos i have migraines (risk of stroke) and a nut allergy (other pills have peanut oil) soooo thats fun xx :)
1732 2018-06-23 19:39:17 TOR has the storage component for oil and that is often overlooked. Now back to how.
1733 2018-06-23 19:39:14 Extralube ZX-1 is awesome. Put it in your bike oil and your fuel. I even put a few drops on on my chain. Alan Milliard used it on his latest bike. You’ll notice the difference after 3-400 miles.
1734 2018-06-23 19:39:05 looks like he's leaking oil

1737 2018-06-23 19:38:33 I read a story about how the Koch Brothers kill high speed rail and other transit projects to keep people in their cars and jammed into planes for their oil profits that are higher b/c of the tax cut.  They convinced ranchers in Texas to say that it would scare the cows.
1738 2018-06-23 19:38:10 Listen, the US didn’t give af about what was happening to the Jews in Germany. They entered WWll because of Pearl Harbor, money, power and oil. They are portrayed as great heroes in Holocaust films but were over here fcking black folks up in some of the same ways.
1739 2018-06-23 19:37:56 Prob figure if they're paying the bonus "fuck that, he'll play for us".

1746 2018-06-23 19:37:03 Tax reform seems to be all you can talk about. Oil prices and a trade war will probably negate that. What about health care and immigration. #2018Midterms @CNN
1747 2018-06-23 19:36:38 Are oil diffusers any good? 
1748 2018-06-23 19:36:35 I use urban decay de-slick oil control makeup setting spray it’s so good it helps my makeup stay for a long time and I never get oily
1749 2018-06-23 19:36:27 You never know! Maybe the Oil envision a Fuhr-Moog type tandem down the road with Skinner-Rodrigue?

1751 2018-06-23 19:36:14 They dont tell you to go on a plant based diet for reasons you think they do. Its to fix a short term issue brought on by typical western diet that is a result of high carbohydrate and vegetable oil intakes.
1752 2018-06-23 19:36:13 Came to the shop to get an oil change right at the start of the pachanga 
1753 2018-06-23 19:36:09 toss them in olive oil, sprinkle with salt & pepper, roast them in the oven until crispy. Make a lemon pepper aioli as a dipping sauce (or just sprinkle lemon pepper or squeeze a lemon over them, either way.) and  . Enjoy your bangin' sprouts.

1761 2018-06-23 19:35:07 Actually. I'll go with the sustained spike in oil prices caused by the destabilising impact of military operations in an oil production region being the tipping point for the economic meltdown.
1762 2018-06-23 19:34:49 Maybe it's Bc of the oil, diamonds, minerals, & vast tracts of land + taxable debt slave citizens to sign up !? 
1763 2018-06-23 19:34:46 Imagine what someone living during Classical Antiquity would think if they saw what the average person’s home is like today. Just the building materials alone would send those peeps for a loop.

To turn it on its head, imagine bringing oil and machinery *shivers*
1764 2018-06-23 19:34:37 So put Bali body tanning oil on Lloyd’s nipple while he was asleep in the sun and now he is perplexed on why he has one nipple darker than the other 
1765 2018-06-23 19:34:19 Just a thought but it seems to me that oil consuming countries and global expansion would benefit from a weaker USD. President Trump should stop with tariffs and harangue the FOMC for the next several months.
1766 2018-06-23 19:34:15 Good point, but how can the Canadian economy survive without digging up and selling every last resource? Are you suggesting that @JustinTrudeau spent over $11 billion of taxpayer’s money to shut down existing pipeline and make sure oil cannot be exported?
1767 2018-06-23 19:34:08 Interesting photo, no Eco-Activist protestors to be seen? Shipping oil by rail vs pipelines was their greatest success!

1770 2018-06-23 19:33:22 The potatoes are from the oven without anything. I added brown butter and salt on the dish. The beets are raw with a simple dressing of canola oil, apple vinegar, p&s. The rest is visible. Maybe try mackerel if you cant find harring. If there is a Dutch community, they know.
1771 2018-06-23 19:33:08 Well actually I hv a little sprits left mixed in with rose hip oil, but the original spray is gone
1772 2018-06-23 19:32:58 I see it like a cult. They have an infection. Yes it is a bit their doing. But it’s still sad that people are ruining their lives for a stupid lie invented by a snake oil pusher.
1773 2018-06-23 19:32:48 Somewhat off topic but have you read Seeing Like an Oil Company?
1774 2018-06-23 19:32:43 Oh dear. The billions ££££ in oil, renewables & scotch divided by 65mil is better than a divisor of 5.5mil As the biggest net exporter we are the Only economy in UK that could balance its books

1778 2018-06-23 19:32:10 I feel so stupid. I just realized Magma energy is essentially Oil.... #DARLI_FRA
1779 2018-06-23 19:32:05 Yes. I am not too crazy about eating out... mostly because I don’t know what kind of oil was used in preparation. Oil is evil.
1780 2018-06-23 19:32:00 Agreed, I see your point now. Missed the bit where Bob suggested ROR would likely remain in Buffalo if not traded by July 1st...odd indeed.
1781 2018-06-23 19:31:55 You can’t read so this pointless but the link you sent me has “energy” at 6.5% of gdp which includes all energy such as hydro, coal, nat gas, solar etc.. basic searching will reveal to you that 3% attributed to oil sector is accurate and about 2% of the 3 is oil sands. Jesus.
1782 2018-06-23 19:31:46 That’s b/c leftists are perpetual victims. 
1783 2018-06-23 19:31:44 there bikes use oil clue less
1784 2018-06-23 19:31:43 Three straight years the Oil have taken a goalie. The internal competition will be great! One of them needs to become a starter in the NHL.
1785 2018-06-23 19:31:39 Does anybody remember the chips made with non-digestable oil? Super low in fat and calories, tasted *exactly* like real chips, OK in small portions. 
All that oil had to go somewhere and it went there pretty quick. They were gone in a year.
1786 2018-06-23 19:31:33 got jojoba oil for $3

1790 2018-06-23 19:31:08 We get it TJ you have the ass to withstand hot oil, but even folks with the attention span of a cantaloupe know better than to say "nigger" at work.
1791 2018-06-23 19:31:01 The government of Syria has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Kelly Rutherford in a bombazine wig.

1801 2018-06-23 19:29:26 Says something about how weak the Flames' room happens to be. No leadership I guess.
1802 2018-06-23 19:29:24 Its similar to the narrative coming out of Boston after the trade.... I just don't see why that makes you want to trade a guy
1803 2018-06-23 19:29:12 Clean energy companies should actively steal employees from coal and oil companies.. I think that would solve everyone's problems and concerns...
1804 2018-06-23 19:29:10 Yeah, I knew about NK charade and the pipeline...that makes sense. After the pipeline is secured, I’m expecting war w/ Iran. That will drastically curtail oil supplies and RU will make a killing...
1805 2018-06-23 19:29:08 I've been at a car repair shop for 5 hours. All I needed was a window roller fixed and an oil change, but the person in charge of getting the parts fucked up and didn't get the proper replacement screws. So they've been trying to find matching screws in other shops.

1811 2018-06-23 19:28:41 I have a friend who's a pediatric physical therapist, she believes in essential oil treatments and bee pollen curing allergies.
1812 2018-06-23 19:28:35 If only someone would invent a long pipe that would connect oil producing areas with refineries instead of shipping by rail.

1826 2018-06-23 19:25:44 I never defended Democrats, and never implied there isn’t corruption on both sides.

But currently, I’m concerned about things like the Sec’y of Education personally profiting from charter schools or the EPA chair’s retirement fund dependent on oil and coal stocks.

When asked what kind of writer she was: “I'm a 48-year-old writer who can remember being a 10-year-old writer and who expects someday to be an 80-year-old writer... an oil-and-water combination of ambition, laziness, insecurity, certainty, and drive.”

1852 2018-06-23 19:22:47 I bring in my car for an oil change and now I need new tires, breaks, and filters. 
1853 2018-06-23 19:22:12 Omg im so excited. Its ravioli stuffed with spinach, pecorino and green garlic and im gonna put MORE garlic and cheese and olive oil and a tiny bit of tomato sauce on it
1854 2018-06-23 19:22:06 today my mom and i went to fairway for the first time in like 4 years & we left with three different types of milk substitutes, pink lemonade, prosecco, & truffle oil goat cheese. mothers and daughters are an unstoppable force
1855 2018-06-23 19:21:55 If you’ve noticed breakage try to avoid an styles that are going to pull too much on your scalp or cause too much friction. Try massaging your scalp a couple times a week with an oil such as the Jamaican black castor oil. You should slowly notice some improvement

1861 2018-06-23 19:21:19 I like my treatments  is your hair more oily, dry or combination? Btw to get the oil off of your face it's best to use warm water on a microfiber towel but cotton works too, don't get it off with straight up soap!!!

1865 2018-06-23 19:20:55 LOL You are hilarious!  And you obviously are uninformed!  Ever heard of the natural gas and oil industry?  Of course it's hard for brain  washed people to understand! LOL. Legal immigrants are welcome.  ILLEGAL should be sent packing!

1869 2018-06-23 19:20:40 Imagine a world with leaders who don't lie to start wars for oil; who want to create health and social systems free for all; who want to support industries which do not pillage the planet; and most of all are decent, caring people.
1870 2018-06-23 19:20:39 Don’t kid yourself. Canada has never lost a war and try running a military without Canadian oil and hydro electricity. Enjoy sitting in the dark!

I love spice & have never experienced that reaction
I got maced in the army & that was easier
1875 2018-06-23 19:19:56 So the qualified objection I have is not people protecting their friends (as they understand it) which I support & have done myself. It's the dogmatic assertion that this is always pure black & white & if you don't agree, you're a rape apologist.

PS: You don't oil compasses.

1881 2018-06-23 19:19:13 You worry about oil prices and inflation and invest more in it instead of renewables, you are visionless like congress
1882 2018-06-23 19:19:08 But if OPEC steps up oil production that would lower prices, wouldn’t it. It was my understanding that 45 withdrew from the Iran deal in order to cause a lower supply and increase gas prices. I’m genuinely confused.

1887 2018-06-23 19:18:48 Oil change this morning on my 2018 TLX @RonTonkinAcura with complimentary car wash in 35 minutes flat! Awesome service! 
1888 2018-06-23 19:18:42 @realDonaldTrump I guess OPEC with a little promise of making money would see themselves to pushing a little more oil. I also guess the ART OF THE DEAL would help you know who.

1894 2018-06-23 19:17:51 Ya worked out real well. With the lack of center depth in this draft teams reached for them to fill needs. Ended up working perfectly for the Oil

1896 2018-06-23 19:17:41 Need touch of dawn dish soap also to break up the oil in hair.
1897 2018-06-23 19:17:33 Except now every Twitter GM is pissy about the fact his dad works for the Oil. Apparently that means we should have picked a lower ranked G whose dad doesn't work in hockey

1899 2018-06-23 19:17:26 Essentially the agreement is not worth the paper it’s written on. Merely political window dressing. They will ensure $WTI $oil is pressured lower until U.S. elections and then let it rise later. #OOTT

1928 2018-06-23 19:14:30 Fracturing and directional drilling. These two technologies allowed the Americans to tap tight oil, which is why global supply glut and reduced American markets for our oil.
1929 2018-06-23 19:14:29 Along with oil and coal and gas and minerals and leases of federal lands for cattle and timber production. Our countries assets have been handed to the multinationals, and we are still forced to buy their protection overseas

1951 2018-06-23 19:12:38 Which anti-vegan arguments are you referring to? 

Btw vegan diet can definitely be unhealthy if you eat processed foods/too much sugar/oil/salt.  In order to eat health you have to eat whole food plant based diet. 

Veganism isn't about health for starters.

1965 2018-06-23 19:10:42 Haha so it had nothing to do with the vast left wing social policies implemented like nationalizing the oil fields to fund a nationwide pension for every citizen.
1966 2018-06-23 19:10:40 yes, AB's wealth benefits the entire country. Quebec & Atlantic Canada import foreign oil as we have no way to ship our oil to them. and i'm as frustrated as you that QB & others oppose EE ( & TMX). but saying "Alberta gets nothing in return" is an absurd statement

1978 2018-06-23 19:09:44 We have more oil than them, and higher per capita income, you are making an argument for nationalizing oil reserves, which I won't argue with.

1980 2018-06-23 19:09:41 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.

1986 2018-06-23 19:09:15 “Women and girls are Africa’s greatest untapped resource, and it is they, not diamonds or oil and minerals, that will be the foundation for solid, sustainable and equitable progress. Health and development experts, economists, NGOs, @UN agencies, and even banks agree that.

1988 2018-06-23 19:09:03 Hmm. It opens up capacity for others to push forward oil. Net affect is nothing.
1989 2018-06-23 19:09:02 I'd recommend that only on spot treatment. Like castor oil it can dry out your skin if used too much and that only makes your skin produce MORE oil

1995 2018-06-23 19:08:45 This is the best oil change I've ever gotten there is a doggo named grizz that keeps coming to say hello :)
1996 2018-06-23 19:08:43 Rescheduled for Tuesday and wound up with a free oil change for my trouble, so I am not complaining 
1997 2018-06-23 19:08:30 “This coconut oil is dripping into my asshole “
1998 2018-06-23 19:08:22 Someone needs to create an essential oil called “leave me the fuck alone” so I can rub that shit all over me.
1999 2018-06-23 19:08:08 Spare capacity, as a % of demand, is now at levels seen only once in 20 years.... oecd inventories are normalized but heading lower & geo-political risk is v. high. Next yr. we get the fall in conventional oil projects delivering 1st oil -that has got to be a bullish combination!

2008 2018-06-23 19:07:31 Some cool Oil Kings news: Trey Fix-Wolansky goes to CBJ at No. 204 after being passed over last season.
2009 2018-06-23 19:07:29 Alaskans own 781,823 shares of OIL REFINERIES LTD, worth $308,810. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in ISRAEL.
2010 2018-06-23 19:07:05 I'm so proud of you though getting that oil changed 
2011 2018-06-23 19:06:55 yess get a bottle of that & some circle cotton pads. Tea tree oil helps too. You can mix the ACV with a couple drops of tea tree in a mason jar & just store the cotton pads in there. that’s what I do. Then wipe your face down before & after bed.
2012 2018-06-23 19:06:43 Not so fast.....lol
2013 2018-06-23 19:06:40 I learned how to make delicious vegan mug cakes with olive oil and oat flour and it’s the best and worst thing that’s ever happened to me.
2014 2018-06-23 19:06:34 Isn’t “taking” the problem?  Thats all the others do.  If they won’t treat us fairly we simply leave!  We invite Sask. and Grande Turk to join us.  Then we charge market price for our oil (+ small  Nuisance fee for Quebec and Ontario.  #abpoli @jkenney
2015 2018-06-23 19:06:33 hi babes. i just had a massage. oh my god my body feels so relaxed  i really needed this

2016 2018-06-23 19:06:33 Since we are going into a trade war anway, how about a $100 per ton carbon tariff on foreign oil?
2017 2018-06-23 19:06:27 Hey, the owner just has a religious conviction to not serve people who bear false witness
2018 2018-06-23 19:06:22 some asshole I know let their car get down to 0% oil life.

Hypocrites: lying through their teeth since FOREVER.
2026 2018-06-23 19:06:04 Haven’t gotten burnt yet so naturally, I only put on tanning oil today.  I told you there would be a time that I got too comfortable. 
The sun is about to fuck me up.
2027 2018-06-23 19:05:55 at a gas station and this guy really just started checking his oil. tired of pretentious assholes
2028 2018-06-23 19:05:46 Yea, Norway has an excellent deal with the EU and put all of their oil money into a public fund worth a trillion by now.
Switzerland has lived off tax evasion and money laundering for as long as they exist.
Those 2 "models" are covered. Like opening a Video Rental Shop.
2029 2018-06-23 19:05:26 Do Toyota’s ever not leak oil?
2030 2018-06-23 19:05:19 Y'all I was supposed to wake up early today to shower and make muffins for my work's potluck. I forgot to set an alarm and woke up at like 10/showered and now its 12 and I need six eggs for my muffins and I only had two so I substituted the rest with vegetable oil pls send help
2031 2018-06-23 19:05:19 Yep! And I’m being told the people are healed by Jesus? Which Jesus ever made people pay for water, prayer, oil, healing! What barbaric and backwards thinking is that? Yerr! Lack of knowledge will finish our poor black society, I swear!
2032 2018-06-23 19:05:10 Oh saalan means curry. So like meat cooked with any vegetable. But oil, ghee, butter is all ok on Keto! It's encouraged :)
2033 2018-06-23 19:05:01 And it ran I to the recesses? And used less than slapping it on with a brush?

I used an oil wash on mine, took about a week to dry but it did the job cheaply.
2034 2018-06-23 19:04:58 That's a joke, right?

Are you continuing with "we wouldn't have electricity/plumbing/garbage disposal/oil without women"?
2035 2018-06-23 19:04:50 I think the Russian oil is not good for the German machine #WORLDCUP #GERSWE #KFSworldcup.

2037 2018-06-23 19:04:34 So as I am waiting for my car oil change, I’m waiting and listening to Spotify right? Well in my car I use Bluetooth to connect my phone and they just took my car in and apparently it was blasting Airplane pt2  sorry mechanic #notreally #bts
2038 2018-06-23 19:04:31 You want to be vaccinated with this too then: Mercury, MSG, squalene, PEANUT OIL, glyphosate (weed killer) squalene, phenol, formaldehyde, fetal cells, animal kidney cells, FORMALDEHYDE and aluminium. Go get it girl!

On smaller side in height but built very solid. #2018NHLDraft #THW
2042 2018-06-23 19:04:08 Do...do people really use olive oil...?
2043 2018-06-23 19:03:52 Hey! Congrats @Wally9191. 

@kingquid @Wurdfurd @ProfDumptruck14 Your Blue Jackets just got an Oil King
2044 2018-06-23 19:03:51 So we can let the rest of the oil producers ( with minimal environmental regulations) around the world extract and refine? Safer to have it done in Canada
2045 2018-06-23 19:03:48 LOL. Bad hair day...use virgin coconut oil from  Manila. Still love ya.
2046 2018-06-23 19:03:32 Been there done that. After the oil patch collapsed I sold everything for a dime on the dollar. They'll make you go to classes  stuffed with mouth breathing morons and teachers not much better.
I hope your experience is better than mine.
2047 2018-06-23 19:03:32 LOL i need to get on this keto bandwagon, sounds sensible. Saalan is butter or ghee or normal oil? Sorry about the incessant queries, just need to ask someone who has had first hand experience
2048 2018-06-23 19:03:19 Perhaps, then, the owner should have thought twice about bragging about it on social media, (her help as well) which precipitated the question to Sarah Sanders, who answered it.

Nothing is ever so Lefty as crying about the artillery strike you called in on yourself.
2049 2018-06-23 19:03:08 Was just at @EconoLube in Spruce Grove. Friendly and good service. Family run company. Recommend for oil change.

2055 2018-06-23 19:02:47 Quebec & Ottawa pay Bombardier to sell planes @ less than cost. WTF
Quebec likes US free trade as long as US can’t sell cheaper dairy product in Canada. Trump keeps bitching bout dairy. 
Quebec says no pipeline likes Tanker Oil from Saudi Sheiks, Venezuela dictator & USA Why
2056 2018-06-23 19:02:28 They're pretty good if they've been dipped in a beer batter and the oil was hit enough that they aren't too greasy.  Also tasty with ranch dressing. #Furrytails
2057 2018-06-23 19:02:09 Yep, bad management, as I said a few times already. How is instituting policies that benefit the most poor “bribing” them...? He should have diversified & stopped the reliance on oil, but didn’t & so things have gone south. Again, it’s not even socialist, it’s capitalist.

2059 2018-06-23 19:02:03 I'm in mn tax cuts put 1850 in my pocket.  My  Nephew works in the north Dakota oil fields and production is down. Until they go back to full perdition gas prices will continue to rise. As far as kids in jails  don't come here illegally and wont have that problem.
2060 2018-06-23 19:02:00 What do beauty oil and night cream do?
2061 2018-06-23 19:01:50 Do I really need to remind you that Alberta's oil, not energy, industry is 72% in foreign hands? Why don't you get them to build refineries in Alberta? Then no one would object to pipelines. Stop lying, Jason!  #cdnpoli
2062 2018-06-23 19:01:44 Minister @jmettle   the #vovome song with the Bethel Revival Choir is awesome and refreshing.  May your oil never run dry. It was flawless. 
2063 2018-06-23 19:01:39 Ah bless them, yes I have hEDS and it’s very sore. Hoping thc/cannabis oil will help! I hear it’s good for EDS from the people who have it in legal medical cannabis places. Also building muscle through physio/weights has been key to maintaining what quality of life I have left x
2064 2018-06-23 19:01:35 Girl get your money back!! But use the bleach London white toner and it will help massively (it’s what I used when I had white hair) and coconut oil overnight for nourishment xxx
2065 2018-06-23 19:01:27 Since we are going into a trade war anway how about a 50% tariff on foreign oil?
2066 2018-06-23 19:01:14 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.

2068 2018-06-23 19:00:57 I have not. All my gardens are spray-free.

The canola oil treatments will not irradicate PM, just slow it down. A couple of the bio-controls are supposed to be more effective.

They are almost all organic, for what it is worth.

2072 2018-06-23 19:00:49 Further, Quebec took a leading role in killing Energy East. Thus preventing Canada’s oil resources from reaching their full market value. That role is costing this country billions.
2073 2018-06-23 19:00:37 SMH so my starter went out. My air conditioning motor broke. My power steering is goin out. I need new wheel bearings. A new tire. & I need an oil change. LOL ANYTHING ELSE??????
2074 2018-06-23 19:00:35 Paying someone else to change my car oil remains both weird and very frustrating.
2075 2018-06-23 19:00:34 Probs a build up of wax, go buy some olive oil ear drops from pharmacy use everyday for 2 weeks. If it doesn’t clear up see your doc and they should irrigate them Hun xxx

2083 2018-06-23 18:59:42 Everything and anything! My favorite is to use it on roasted veggies + olive oil.
2084 2018-06-23 18:59:32 204th overall pick is Oil Kings Trey Fix-Wolansky who is off to CBJ. Highly creative buzz saw player who is stocky but highly creative and has solid shot/passing ability. Stride is short but he can create separating with a quick pace. @FCHockey

2087 2018-06-23 18:59:03 Any good recommendations for foundation for oily skin? Or oil free foundation?
2088 2018-06-23 18:58:58 Bouchard was a huge pick for the Oil. He could play right away possibly. Very talented player
2089 2018-06-23 18:58:51 Don’t be so hard on them. They were giving each other oil jobs #TCMParty
2090 2018-06-23 18:58:49 Fix-Wolansky is listed at 5-8 and had 89 points (32 goals) in 71 games for the Edmonton Oil Kings in the WHL ... so another undersized, highly-skilled forward.

#CBJ
2091 2018-06-23 18:58:46 This is a new thing this fatness. It has something to do with using corn oil/additives in processed and fast food. Or it could be soft drinks (sodas) like Coke or junk food/fried food. I agree, it's epidemic.
2092 2018-06-23 18:58:37 Use castor oil at night! Just make sure to wash it off with a gentle cleanser in the morning. As for filling in if you want a soft natural look go for eyebrow pencils or powder, eyebrow gel helps too!!!
2093 2018-06-23 18:58:30 MSNBC reporting that in response to Trump's request-on Putin's behalf-OPEC has today begun stepping up oil production. Don't tell me that Trump isn't working for Putin. #SaturdayMorning

2096 2018-06-23 18:58:21 @BobTomesFord came here after going to Auto Nation Ford in Frisco, TX when Auto Nation told me they didn't have time for an oil change today and pushed me back out the door @BobTomesFord Service Manager Sam and Johnathsn know how to take care of customers.
2097 2018-06-23 18:58:17 With #CBJ's 7th round pick, 204th overall, the club selects Edmonton Oil Kings right wing Trey Fix-Wolansky. The 19-year old had 32-57-89 in 71 regular season games.

2106 2018-06-23 18:56:57  ain’t that the truth. I was supposed to change the spark plugs in Cam’s Volvo a few months back....omfg!!! It got done but it took 3 days. Boots were all broken, pieces of the boots were stuck in the threads, and oil got through to make it one huge sticky mess
2107 2018-06-23 18:56:50 The guy at the oil change place said he was digging my braids so i’ve got that going for me.

2130 2018-06-23 18:54:13 German engine has stopped working. They need good oil now
2131 2018-06-23 18:54:12 Why don’t the oil companies just refuse to bring them any oil?
2132 2018-06-23 18:54:09 Has Larsson being sunbathing drenched in olive oil in Essex?
2133 2018-06-23 18:54:09 Anyone know a Patrick J. Kelly? He used to work for Shell Oil in New Jersey back in 1960.
2134 2018-06-23 18:54:05 I hate the taste of olive oil
2135 2018-06-23 18:54:00 Guess you should instead get the Steak Tartare?
2136 2018-06-23 18:53:49  sorry father oil
2137 2018-06-23 18:53:47 Clock still running…tick tick tick…but no one is on the track. They all want someone else to scrub off the oil dry. 16 min left.
2138 2018-06-23 18:53:44 There is a group of Senators, none east of Utah, who are set on mining  & drilling on parks in their states. Especially the Gop from Alaska who wants to open the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. As everyone in the state gets a check from oil revenue yearly
2139 2018-06-23 18:53:39 Look, why can’t people just get things right. It wasn’t the Air Force and it was explained very clearly. It’s a well known fact that this spraying is done in a lot of places where oil spills take place.
2140 2018-06-23 18:53:36 @thewiz0915 Can the Germans pull this out? Starting to actually believe they might not.
2141 2018-06-23 18:53:19 And you don’t need to fudge the numbers to prove that the oil sector is important to Canada. 3% of GDP is very significant. Stay on topic.
2142 2018-06-23 18:52:57 I started putting castor oil on my brows  I got goals man
2143 2018-06-23 18:52:56 Your question
2144 2018-06-23 18:52:54 That’s not really true. Tar sands were relabelled “oil sands” in the 1980’s because it sounded better. Just a PR distinction.
2145 2018-06-23 18:52:26 Reading up about how to remove a oil stain on a tarmac driveway and one of the comment was just put oil all over it to blend it in lol
2146 2018-06-23 18:52:25 I buy a young bird like 5 or 6 bucks at the grocery then I olive oil the skin and rub it up with paprika and garlic salt....if you do it right the skin will brown up and crisp....very tasty
2147 2018-06-23 18:52:23 Hunnigan, could you check and see if the BSAA has any units near the oil field?
2148 2018-06-23 18:52:21 Timing aside Quebec gets Billions in Welfare Equalization Oil dollars from Alberta while stopping a East Export Pipeline. They take Alberta money while buying Tanker Oil from Saudi Sheiks, Venezuela’s Killer Dictator & Trump’s USA. Allow foreign tankers in but not tankers out
2149 2018-06-23 18:52:14 He looked exactly like that, must be using oil of olay! 
2150 2018-06-23 18:52:14 Birthplace of the Russian oil industry, if I’m not mistaken 
2151 2018-06-23 18:51:56 I just got my order of CBD oil today!! 
2152 2018-06-23 18:51:54 It's an A+ book
2153 2018-06-23 18:51:54 I bathe in CBD oil
2154 2018-06-23 18:51:53 Oil is not “fossil fuels” its th blood of Mother Earth stop listening to what fucking schools tell you and do some research your self
2155 2018-06-23 18:51:45 Congressional Dems and a public watchdog group are calling for an ethics investigation into Interior Secretary Zinke over a land deal between his family foundation and oil and gas company Halliburton.
2156 2018-06-23 18:51:42 Will, You ain’t right brother!
2157 2018-06-23 18:51:40 RUSSIA'S CONTRIBUTION TO TOTAL INCREASE OF #OPEC+ COUNTRIES' OIL OUTPUT OF 1 MLN B/D TO AMOUNT TO 200,000 B/D - NOVAK: IFX. #OOTT
2158 2018-06-23 18:51:36 There was a bunch of oil dry put down on the track after K&N qualifying, so most of the cars have gone out and then returned to pit road. No one wants to try and make a lap with those conditions. Sort of a game of chicken.
2159 2018-06-23 18:51:33 PONDER THIS!

Nearly every member of Congress and Senate are multi millionaires.  They live in multi million dollar mansions on a salary of 174K a year.  Most own stocks in healthcare, and oil while passing healthcare and environmental laws?  Insider Trading??  That's a FELONY.
2160 2018-06-23 18:51:26 Sorry man, don't buy it. You still hear people like John Shannon still go on about Hall being a deal the Oilers needed to make. Organizations paint guys with a brush b/c they don't fit into their box of what said player should be. IMO, It's just dumb.
2161 2018-06-23 18:51:26 I called Nissan for an quote on an oil change and they straight up said “we actually don’t know, let me call you back in 1-2 days”  what.. lol
2162 2018-06-23 18:51:07 In the UK, as in most of the OECD, oil and gas companies pay the highest effective tax rates. 

I totally agree. Only absolute morons would believe that the highest taxed companies are subsidized.
2163 2018-06-23 18:51:06 NOVAK SAYS ABOUT 8-10 COUNTRIES OUT OF 24 PARTICIPANTS IN #OPEC+ DEAL MAY INCREASE OIL OUTPUT: IFX. #OOTT
2164 2018-06-23 18:50:58 no
2165 2018-06-23 18:50:55 So he can keep his relationship w the billion dollar oil companies smh
2166 2018-06-23 18:50:50 Y’all remember that last really huge oil spill we had??? Scared the shit out of me, it was just oil in the shape of a river in the gulf
2167 2018-06-23 18:50:44 Coconut oil dear
2168 2018-06-23 18:50:38 Since it's summer, that means there's going to be "hoe summer tips" threads going around and I want to just say: please don't use coconut oil as an alternative for shaving pubes. that's asking for a yeast infection, or even worse; a UTI.
2169 2018-06-23 18:50:38 My mom and I are now actively avoiding Palm oil in an effort to help the environment inspired by @LilyTomlin and @Janefonda #frankieandgrace

2177 2018-06-23 18:50:01 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2178 2018-06-23 18:49:59 She mad.

2193 2018-06-23 18:48:27 one might assume holdouts could invade the US if we banned a few oil companies. however, without resistance, invasion might be unsatisfying for the invaders. the invading troops might just convert to our more pleasant oil free lifestyle.
2194 2018-06-23 18:48:23 .@JoeBuscaino is called out by a Wilmington resident that lives next to a massive urban oil field for not being at the @STAND_LA Community Forum.

2199 2018-06-23 18:47:52 Bout time for an oil change looks like.
2200 2018-06-23 18:47:50 Oil sands, or more correctly bituminous sands. No such thing as tar sands. :)

2211 2018-06-23 18:46:08 "A bad, western concept" like objectively defining the right oil level for your engine?
2212 2018-06-23 18:46:04 I've said she sold her soul for her job. All his hires & appointees seem vastly unqualified for the positions they hold Except perhaps Pruitt who is rearranging federal land to open it to oil drilling & coal mining. The president likes this which is why Pruitt continues to..
2213 2018-06-23 18:45:43 I’m going to make myself clean today. Like really go at it and clean......(I tell myself this as I take off my pants, turn on 3 fans and oil diffuser, and crawl into my bed)
2214 2018-06-23 18:45:40 Not true. He used the oil boom to bribe the poor but once the cow is dead the milk money is gone. Have u been to Venezuela?

2216 2018-06-23 18:45:27 nothin gets me ready to look good like going to jc pennys and shopping in the fat guy section. Its easy you just look for the sign that says, “The Foundry,” or like, “Sawdust” or “Whale Oil” or some shit
2217 2018-06-23 18:45:14 I am loving Dr. Riley's talk about delivering "bite size" #diabetes #behaviorchange interventions. To meet the challenge of getting patients to succeed w/ long-term diabetes maintenance, he compares running out of gas (less common) vs. not getting oil changes (common) #2018ADA
2218 2018-06-23 18:45:12 Yes, but it's coming in Canada through US GOP, NRA & Koch bros. As for Con bots, who knows who's paying them. Putin knows there's oil in Canadian Arctic, since he's been very busy drilling in Siberia. #cdnpoli

2231 2018-06-23 18:43:40 The oil industry probably is causing all these earthquakes you can not continue taking out all the coal,oil and gas without a price humanity has to pay.Only a few will benefit but in the end when the planet ends we all will go down
2232 2018-06-23 18:43:19 My ass and this oil

2283 2018-06-23 18:37:33 Good RHD is the most coveted player in hockey, can’t get them. he’s been traded twice for medium returns. Where there is smoke there’s fire

2287 2018-06-23 18:36:56 Without a healthy resource industry, the other more stable jobs will eventually decline too, the telling figure will be when the population begins to leave.  There has always been a risk/reward with the oil patch, however the risk is frightening these days.
2288 2018-06-23 18:36:36 well ~five hours later I have a fixed, oil changed, emissions done, new tag having car

plz don’t ask me to hang out for at least six months

2290 2018-06-23 18:36:19 And dumb donny just rescinded legislation to protect the lakes and oceans from oil spills.
2291 2018-06-23 18:36:13 Eiii de German machine is rusty.need more oil..@coles_gh
2292 2018-06-23 18:36:12 Germany on the brink of exit from #Russia2018 after Toivonen's goal, the German oil is oily.

2293 2018-06-23 18:36:12 To be fair much of the golf states rely  on oil products change would take decades
2294 2018-06-23 18:36:03 Their hypocrisy knows no bounds!
2295 2018-06-23 18:35:58 
2296 2018-06-23 18:35:50 Gonna put black seed oil, castor oil,  coconut oil on my hair and get a six pack
2297 2018-06-23 18:35:42 We need a better vetting process for asylum seekers, one that doesn't tear their children away from them. This is something that the paid officials should be trying to figure out, but instead they're spending time repealing oil spill protections. I dont see either side offering
2298 2018-06-23 18:35:36 Mexico wrecked the German machine and now Sweden is cleaning the oil in it with tissue paper #BBCWorldCup
2299 2018-06-23 18:35:20 Even though they had controlled much of the play, you could see that goal coming. Huge moment for Sweden but these Germans... #WorldCup
2300 2018-06-23 18:35:18 Haha the German machine needs oil
2301 2018-06-23 18:35:12 OPEC reaches deal to raise oil output  @AJEnglish
2302 2018-06-23 18:35:08 Oil pan otw 
2303 2018-06-23 18:35:02 How endangering others when the vaccines are supposed to protect them? WIth these ingredients: Mercury, MSG, squalene, PEANUT OIL, glyphosate (weed killer) squalene, phenol, formaldehyde, fetal cells, animal kidney cells, FORMALDEHYDE and aluminium. Do you actually KNOW this?
2304 2018-06-23 18:34:53 I mistook the sound of my essential oil diffuser for a leaf blower today. Sinus surgery is no joke, y’all. #makeitstop
2305 2018-06-23 18:34:52 You can also make fish en papiotte with foil (if you like fish). We do a good white fish with a little olive oil, sliced summer squash, sliced cherry tomatoes, and sliced lemon. Wrap up packages and cook off flame but near heat for 20-30min
2306 2018-06-23 18:34:47 I was so into my barbacoa taco I didn’t notice the oil going down my arm lmao real messy
2307 2018-06-23 18:34:35 Sorry missed “today”
2308 2018-06-23 18:34:25 trump refused to recognize gay pride month. instead he recognized "ocean month". a week later, he signed an order to allow oil drilling in the oceans. yep, sounds about right. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #gaypride2018

2310 2018-06-23 18:34:07 What's your record protecting the North Carolina coast- especially when Florida got a pass
BTW you DO know there is an oil glut right?
2311 2018-06-23 18:33:56 Kate cares more about her children than you do! Have you vaccinated them lately with the ingredients; 
Mercury, MSG, squalene, PEANUT OIL, glyphosate (weed killer) squalene, phenol, formaldehyde, fetal cells, animal kidney cells, FORMALDEHYDE and aluminium. CONGRATULATIONS!
2312 2018-06-23 18:33:56 So you take money from provinces natural resources and give it to Quebec who imports their oil from countries with no human rights and block Energy East Pipeline, do I have this right ?  You also hate said oil.  
2313 2018-06-23 18:33:52 You're welcome - enjoy!
2314 2018-06-23 18:33:46 Those skulls are epic. Great job! I'm painting Raven Guard. I've spray undercoated, was thinking Nuln Oil shade then some highlights? I've never done deep black before.
2315 2018-06-23 18:33:45 Reverse tooth decay naturally to remove grease or oil stains from clothing.
2316 2018-06-23 18:33:44 Like I said, oil finish for the German machine inside
2317 2018-06-23 18:33:42 Someone should oil the german machine
2318 2018-06-23 18:33:32 $50 in gas, $50 in oil. $5ish in wiper fluid. Cars are expensive.
2319 2018-06-23 18:33:22 @beausloane24 ugH your mind!!! just bought tea tree oil, a new face brush and cetaphil face wash. gonna sort my face out beau style. I’ll keep u updated.
2320 2018-06-23 18:33:14 I love it when people pick up new vocabulary words. Apparently one of the strain on Stapletons...as in airport...wants to be Governor of  Colorado. And he wants Colorado to be mote vibrant. Just what the he'll is more Vibrant than we have now in Colorado  Oil N Grass.
2321 2018-06-23 18:33:13 Dere it is.. Dis German machine no b better machine again.. De oil make dirty
2322 2018-06-23 18:33:11 Today? I most certainly can. That knock against Hamilton is the same nonsense we hear w/ a guy like Kessel. As I said, down the road it could look better for the Flames but as of right now it is a clear win for the Canes. Especially when Calgary is trying to win now.
2323 2018-06-23 18:32:57 Okay I'm not a hippie but I'm bummed cause I got oil on my tye dye shirt and I am oddly sad about it.
2324 2018-06-23 18:32:50 Should have been more careful. I'm an idiot, I put a wet spatula into hot oil. Not my finest moment. Haha.
2325 2018-06-23 18:32:40 I make saffron & mascarpone cheese risotto topped w sautéed squash & zucchini. Add a pinch of saffron to the water when you’re cooking th rice, then add 1/4 cup mascarpone at the end. Sauté squash with garlic in olive oil while risotto cooks, serve on top.
2326 2018-06-23 18:32:32 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*

2330 2018-06-23 18:32:01 Scotland "Contributes more per head, higher GDP per head", and assumes only part share of north sea oil revenue. GERS is widely acknowledged to be pish. And onyhow, as I've told you many times, Scotland will be leaving the Union.
So there 
2331 2018-06-23 18:31:54 Big Oil

Car companies that are not @Tesla.

Just to name a couple.
2332 2018-06-23 18:31:07 Let’s see...he imposed two rounds of sanctions, killed 200 Russian mercenaries, armed Ukraine, gave poland missile defense, is toppling the mullahs, and increasing US nat gas and oil production to destroy Rus economy.  You watch too much TV son.  Do some research.  Facts matter.
2333 2018-06-23 18:30:57 In the past - used to be lots of road rage killings there-  hot, humid, oil refinery odors, etc. and now the flooding seems to be on the increase.
2334 2018-06-23 18:30:24 Next time you're in ask about our essential oil selection! You can add one or even a mix to your massage for only $5!

2337 2018-06-23 18:29:59 I hate going and getting oil changes in my car
2338 2018-06-23 18:29:58 Wouldn't surprise me but I don't think he does that.
2339 2018-06-23 18:29:49 They lost jobs in oil@industry when oil@prices fell and it was costing more to get it out the sea bed than sell, basic economics really.
2340 2018-06-23 18:29:48 last time overcome was giving credit to 3 world countries and selling oil below spot market price,  desperate measure.
2341 2018-06-23 18:29:32 The problem isn't impurities. There are ultra high thc strains now and people are only smoking the bud which has far higher concentration.

In the past, people smoked a combo of leaf and bud or resin/oil which were much weaker.

There's far more evidence against alcohol though.
2342 2018-06-23 18:29:25 Thank you David! I use mainly watercolor since 10 years ago and still learn things. On the other hand, i don't master oil painting like you do. Have a good weekend!

2345 2018-06-23 18:29:10 Yeah. It wears me out emotionally. 
And yesterday's oil change revealed I need new belts and tires for the car.

2348 2018-06-23 18:28:51 My friend brought up an interesting point about this yesterday.  Look at the top 12 players in the deep draft... most are out east now. Win for oil
2349 2018-06-23 18:28:44 But are they made from oil or real milk? Wait what were you talkin about?
2350 2018-06-23 18:28:39 Have you been to Winnipeg?
2351 2018-06-23 18:28:39 Very fair
2352 2018-06-23 18:28:19 Can you tell me where all of Scotland's oil revenues have gone?
2353 2018-06-23 18:28:12 Oh man. My last 'shop instead of finish script' begot me:
-Giant stack of comics (I generally don't read comics)
-Hairdye & treatment system from Overtone
-Scale
-Face cream
-Three different pairs of earrings I spent *hours* choosing on etsy
-CBD oil for my dog
2354 2018-06-23 18:28:12 Owner must be one of the two people who follow Kathy Griffith.  Pretty sure the other is Kathy Griffith.  Disgusting!
2355 2018-06-23 18:28:03 The most experienced people I know are very experienced at knowing when to *not* do something. Or when a Great. New. Thing. is a reinvention of the same snake oil.
2356 2018-06-23 18:27:59 Exactly. Not many places have the natural water resources to support hydro. Citing Seattle is citing an outlier
2357 2018-06-23 18:27:54 عايزه حاجة زي ال coconut oil كده احيها على حياتي يمكن تتعدل
2358 2018-06-23 18:27:43 Me: Trump just rescinded a policy protecting oceans from oil spills
Trump supporter: He's doing a great job; I'm proud of our president.
Me: 
Me: let me read that again. Trump rescinds Obama policy protecting oceans from oil spills
Trump supporter: He's crushing it!
2359 2018-06-23 18:27:29 Pure Shea butter and coconut oil all summer
2360 2018-06-23 18:27:26 Because it will pieces in the oil
2361 2018-06-23 18:27:22 Damnable oil burns.  Still healing from a good splash myself a few week ago. Obviously I can't cook and talk any longer, too complicated. 
Heal quickly!
2362 2018-06-23 18:27:08 Snake oil salesmen, or shall I say, salesPeople.
2363 2018-06-23 18:26:52 My boss just bought me rose cbd oil and a rose gold necklace vibrator LMAO
2364 2018-06-23 18:26:49 PEPPERMINT OIL
2365 2018-06-23 18:26:37 It will end up with Trump’s name and engraving on it. Commemorates old EPA people, who really helped. EPA was censored, re-missioned, and destroyed by Trump & Co. EPA now is anti-environmental agency funded and run by oil & gas billionaires. One of first agencies targeted.
2366 2018-06-23 18:26:37 Like serious I rode twice with him.
One night run and some other time,
Mbombela weekend his bike started sweating oil from the engine, hope the bike is okay
2367 2018-06-23 18:26:03 Nothing can’t beat hair oil champi 
2368 2018-06-23 18:25:55 Speaking as someone who can't tell a gallon from a cubit, maybe @BBCNews needs to amend its ticker re the Iowa oil spill.
2369 2018-06-23 18:25:41 Oil club talking about respect
2370 2018-06-23 18:25:28 According to this one website I found: Small spots of hardened candle wax can be removed from fabric by rubbing with a generous dollop of vegetable oil. Wipe off any excess oil with paper towels, then launder as usual.
2371 2018-06-23 18:25:20 Hedging is not a bad strategy but don’t compare us with oil producing nations we can’t play on the same level
2372 2018-06-23 18:25:16 I highly doubt that the majority of homes in Winnipeg (Manitoba) are heated using hydro electric exclusively.
2373 2018-06-23 18:25:16 City color - oil control matte finish setting spray. It's HELLA cheap, sorta the off brand of the NYX oil control setting spray. But tbh I like the City Color one better.
2374 2018-06-23 18:24:59 The confusion & contradictory comes only from your tweets as #OPEC made another success & proved you wrong!

It's fine to confess your inability to understand market dynamics since OPEC+ didn't die in May as you suggested earlier!

#OOTT #OIL #SAUDI_ARABIA #SAUDI #SAUDIARABIA
2375 2018-06-23 18:24:55 Always the case. But you can only guess at the real motives. Usually oil, which is why I'm not so cynical about motives in Yugoslavia.
2376 2018-06-23 18:24:45 ไม่ไหว
2377 2018-06-23 18:24:35 Please tell me you won't support a negotiated peace that keeps the status quo of US occupied oil fields and a proxy Kurdish state. Syria needs to remain a multi ethnic Arab nationalist state. We can't let it be partitioned by the US.
2378 2018-06-23 18:24:28 เดี๋ยวสกินแคร์เลอะนะ
2379 2018-06-23 18:24:24 Going to get my brother (who is a mechanic) to change my oil
Brother: "do you remember how much oil this takes?"
Me: "well I don't quite rememb-"
Brother: "I think it was 4"
Me: "uh....4 what?"
Brother: "yeah, 4 oil."
2380 2018-06-23 18:24:23 Snake oil

2383 2018-06-23 18:24:18 So far we have had good luck with it.  The secret is get a pump spray oil ( we us canola) and be liberal with it.
2384 2018-06-23 18:24:17 German machine oil iliekwa mpya

2388 2018-06-23 18:23:39 Scalpel? Check. Forceps? Check. Oil gauge? Check.
2389 2018-06-23 18:23:29 ว่าจะไม่คิดถึงแล้วนะ
2390 2018-06-23 18:23:16 Player by player it’s not a huge loss, but I think people don’t realize how good the Gio-Ham pair was.

Like, they were legitimately top 5 in the league. Flames w/o those two are the Oilers w/o McDavid.

Breaking that up is  for the Flames but  for the Oil
2391 2018-06-23 18:23:13 Want a salad from OG but olive oil & bread from Carino's 
2392 2018-06-23 18:22:51 Why didn’t anyone tell me Kiehl’s dry body oil is like lotion but WAY faster?
2393 2018-06-23 18:22:39 We have some water softener salt and also some tiki torch fuel/oil. First come first served. #randomgiveaways

2397 2018-06-23 18:22:04 Sooooooooooooo it´s all about energetics? Crude oil?...
2398 2018-06-23 18:22:00 Can you say “no question” when Hanafin is still 20 years old and two teams in two years were happy to get rid of Hamilton?
2399 2018-06-23 18:22:00 Hot bath? I add 2 cups of ACV, some sea salt and a couple of drops of lavender oil. Skin feels amazing, it's soothing af, and it feels like pampering.
2400 2018-06-23 18:21:52 Getting a oil change
2401 2018-06-23 18:21:33 The confusion and the contradictory came only from your tweets! #OPEC made another success & you proved yourself wrong!

2404 2018-06-23 18:21:08 The German machine needs a little oil
2405 2018-06-23 18:21:02 Highs and the hell of the pork as tightly as federal judge to cover and thyme in hot oil prices in fire at the pork is hot
2406 2018-06-23 18:20:58 Scary thing is, it is still miles better than anything good ol' Pete has been able to accomplish from this end .
2407 2018-06-23 18:20:20 I dont care if I cant have this Kukui Nut what ever. You know what it's only like 2% of the product. Probably
I NEED THIS STUFF FOR MY HAIR
THIS 2% OF KUKUI NUT OIL WON'T STAND IN MY WAY OF A GOOD PRODUCT
2408 2018-06-23 18:20:19 i think i put too much tea tree oil on my face
2409 2018-06-23 18:20:12 This could be a play by the FBI to force the GOP to see their options. Recognize Trump is a crook and abandon any pretence that his oil slick of incompetence isn’t washing up on their personal shores. Or, get ready to represent the good people of cell block C.
2410 2018-06-23 18:20:04 Spin it anyway you want but Viewers KNOW this #ImmigrationCrisis is decades old and #Trump Admin is trying to fix it. You couldn't make the #Nazi BS stick so now it's @POTUS is being mean to the Mayberry #BorderChildren #FakeNews is snake oil.
2411 2018-06-23 18:20:02 Bought Amla Oil and Coconut Oil for my hair. Let's see progress.
2412 2018-06-23 18:19:58 There’s a big difference between net and gross exports. US oil and gas are very different.
2413 2018-06-23 18:19:57 Great. Car broke down on the way home from the zoo. $ I don’t have to spend. 150$ just to check the engine. Oil change ect. :/ at least we made it back to the shop. Just waiting to get picked up from the roommate. Why today?!
2414 2018-06-23 18:19:53 If you have Trader Joe’s by you they have prepackaged pizza dough that’s pretty damn good. I do a carmelized onion/bacon/fresh mozzarella. No sauce, just olive oil moz and grated parm.
2415 2018-06-23 18:19:27 I live 40 yards from the water's edge, on Andrew's Point in Rockport so... I like the center of a brownie, but the edge of an Umberto's sicilian slice (on Hanover St.). I like rings, but they give me agita so, I'll take fries with 1 or 2 onions in the oil.
2416 2018-06-23 18:19:23 We love coconut oil! We use it in a few of our #spa products. It’s great for soaking in and makes your skin so soft!
2417 2018-06-23 18:19:22 "What is... Jasmine Oil?"
2418 2018-06-23 18:19:19 Do you see a difference in how the two mixtures with non-drying vs. the drying oil react to water? When used on its own olive oil is usually washed off relatively quickly. Would love to hear how it works when mixed with wax.
2419 2018-06-23 18:19:16 Haircut 
Drop car off for oil & tire change 
Kill shoulder and arm day 

Walk home from gym because car is still in the shop AKA cardio 
2420 2018-06-23 18:19:12 Well that what's happens when people who care about their society and country meet up.
But I'm sure the Snake oil salesmen with be on Sunday morning politics TV shows slagging us all off for not wanting a joyless brexit.
At least we have today, they can't ignore us anymore.
2421 2018-06-23 18:18:59 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
2422 2018-06-23 18:18:41 Whale oil be glad about that.
2423 2018-06-23 18:18:35 What about protecting our natural resources and national parks rather than the greedy oil and logging companies?
2424 2018-06-23 18:18:10 Pray for me nothing wrong I just always need a oil change 
2425 2018-06-23 18:18:09 vitamin e oil is reeeeally good for scars!!! makes ur skin super soft too

2430 2018-06-23 18:17:16 THC OIL goes straight into my bloodstream and into my brain....I need to find a quicker way.....

2435 2018-06-23 18:16:44 As someone who is poor, they insult me with this crap
2436 2018-06-23 18:16:41 If Canada digs up and allows the remaining 173 billion barrels of oil locked in the Tarsands to be burned, it will use up 30% of the remaining global carbon budget if we’re to stop at 1.5 deg of warming. With a population of less than 1/2 of 1% of the world, is that fair?
2437 2018-06-23 18:16:40 For an oil change ?!!!
2438 2018-06-23 18:16:38 Less than 5 Years

2452 2018-06-23 18:15:12 I wish quality CBD oil wasn’t so expensive. 
2453 2018-06-23 18:14:47 CBD oil has helped quite a bit for me
2454 2018-06-23 18:14:34 I no longer listened to it, I threw myself on olive oil, and I bathed my ass with, I put the dose. I massaged my buttocks for the oil penetrates well, then I slammed it, the oil gushed in fireworks, I was very proud of me.
- So what do you say now, my ass isn't world champion.

2471 2018-06-23 18:12:18 Oil is a bad idea. Time we transitioned away from it. We are running out of time.
2472 2018-06-23 18:12:17 “It’s hard to say what will cause this giant credit bubble to finally pop. A Turkish lira crisis. Oil prices topping $100 a barrel. A default  BBB bond. A rush to exits by panicked ETF investors. Trying to figure out which is a fool’s errand. Pretending it won’t happen is folly.”
2473 2018-06-23 18:12:10 No question the Hurricanes win this trade today but at least the Flames got two young pieces who will be locked up long term. That said, Carolina got the best player in the deal & didn't give up a ridiculous amount to do it.
2474 2018-06-23 18:12:08 CBD OIL FOR PETS !! I’ll send u some
2475 2018-06-23 18:12:00 How does this not create a hostile work environment?  If you voted for Trump, wouldn’t you feel discriminated against (or at the very least, fear termination) in your own place of employment?

I: "What brand is the new fluid?"
Man: "It's good oil, ma'am."
I: "But what's the brand?"
Man: "It's synthetic."
I: "I know but what's the brand that produces it?" 
Man: "It's differential fluid."
I: "I know but what's the brand??????" 
WTF. #sexism

2518 2018-06-23 18:07:07 I talk about fake cheese and fake meat from a factory.
Not about plant milks, self made soy burgers, tofu,...

Processed fake meat has very little amount of antioxidants, fiber, magnesium.

And tall ≠ healthy.
2519 2018-06-23 18:06:56 Kabobs. Pre cut all your meat before the trip if possible & freeze w/marinade already in the bag. Kabobs I marinate with honey,canola oil, soy sauce, garlic, s&p,oregeno,parsley (dry), & slices of green onion. Skewer orange & grn peppers,red onion. Bring an electric rice cooker.
2520 2018-06-23 18:06:53 3/ are surrounded by it. That's one of the anti-pipeline concerns: lots of short term construction work, but very few ongoing jobs once built.

So the investment shrinks in times of uncertainty, but the oil hasn't stopped flowing.

And the more stable employment sectors are
2521 2018-06-23 18:06:48 In my tweet I write that rising oil prices will make Nigeria a more attractive investor destination, and thus the investors will gain. You're not ignorant, just misread that part - unless I wrote it badly.

2547 2018-06-23 18:03:57 Gulf of Hormuz will be blocked and oil from Saudi and Iraq will be trapped. American economics will suffer.
2548 2018-06-23 18:03:39 Oil prices are up.  Haha
2549 2018-06-23 18:03:29 Time to cut oil and gas revenues out of the formulae if Quebec does not want pipeline or fracking just like they do not include hydro from their end
2550 2018-06-23 18:03:12 I have housesat quite a bit lately and am shocked what ppl do not consider essential. One had no olive oil, one no herbs or garlic /so odd ;)
2551 2018-06-23 18:03:12 So the Oil picked a Decent C in Round 2, Goalie in 3rd? So no more picks until round 5?
2552 2018-06-23 18:03:09 2/ you find this pattern of expansion  and contraction. As a provider of stable, long-term jobs, the oil and gas industry isn't the most reliable.

But now you'd rather sell snake oil to the credulous.  You'll be finished when this goes poo shaped, as it will.

2570 2018-06-23 18:00:51 Smells good. Just baby plum toms cut in half, thinly sliced onions, salt, pepper, EV olive oil and aged balsamic vinegar with a load of parsley
2571 2018-06-23 18:00:47 1/You could stop to think about which jobs and why. How is it that we're still producing so much more oil and gas in 2018 yet employment hasn't fully returned?

It's the expansion of production and transportation of the resources that have slowed. 

When you look at the industry
2572 2018-06-23 18:00:35 @iheartoils_ I love your emoji inside your name!  It rocks!  As an oil lover too, I'm passionate about the #doterra oils too.  Balance is my favorite.  What's yours?
2573 2018-06-23 18:00:29 Suckabee is the head of a family of charlatans. He's a snake oil salesman posing as a street preacher.

2576 2018-06-23 17:59:49 just as Israel is stealing some oil from Syria & natural gas from Gaza;  US is completely discredited by the friends it keeps;
2577 2018-06-23 17:59:43 For weeks I’ve been telling my mom to stop worrying financially and hand it over to Hod. For weeks she didn’t. She finally came to a breaking point and finally stopped worrying. The next day my step father got a call to go back to the oil field.

2585 2018-06-23 17:59:08 @essentialoiluse I love your twitter account!  You guys put out some cool content and I'm an #oil lover as well!  Cheers!

What are you favorite oils?
2586 2018-06-23 17:58:55 Yellow is out in the final round of qualifying. Apparently the clean-up crew did not get all of the oil off the track surface. No one in the final group has got a lap in yet, including Will. #Carneros200 [PR]
2587 2018-06-23 17:58:51 @gardenofliferaw 
So I ordered GOL coconut oil from amazon like I usually do - it came in the mail today and it was liquid from the heat. Will it be OK or do I need to return it?
2588 2018-06-23 17:58:48 it was an elaborate snake oil marketing scheme to make people rethink buying “smart waters” just because the packaging is convincing. like it’s all just fucking water lmao.
2589 2018-06-23 17:58:39 Janine DeBaise talking her childhood & her children’s on the thousand islands. How 10 years after the oil spill of 1976 there was still a black tarry stripe marking the high water line on the small islands. 1/3 if the heron population was lost. “We get used to the new normal”.
2590 2018-06-23 17:58:30 Wild alaskan salmon fish oil, specially formulated to provide vital Omega 3 oils, all natural, specifically for felines.  Added it to cats favorite junk food. They sniffed, sneezed, "buried" the plate and then the one who needs it most turned and bit me. #cats
2591 2018-06-23 17:58:30 And the @GOP sends them to die for oil and personal vendettas...but use them as a prop for your BS
2592 2018-06-23 17:58:14 I just bust my ass in front of like 15 people at the gas station cause somebody shit leaking oil but I was weak af too 
2593 2018-06-23 17:58:10 @RepTipton A super PAC, funded by oil and gas driller SG Interests, is registered at the address of Tipton's campaign attorney and run by a law clerk in his office. It is a violation of election laws for super PACs and a candidate's campaign to coordinate their activities,

2596 2018-06-23 17:57:57 I use like 8 drops of tea tree oil because its good for controlling oil. But choosing an essential oil for your skin type is up to you. There’s DIY recipes all over the internet!! It’s so cheap.
2597 2018-06-23 17:57:48 They’re made in peanut oil and I think the 12 count runs close to 20-30 carbs. If you want to be super strict don’t but it won’t hurt if those are the only carbs you really have for the day:)
2598 2018-06-23 17:57:46 This my first time ever getting oil changed professionally...and the fact my filter is under my car and I don't have a lift ramp thing but ok

2601 2018-06-23 17:57:16 It is not true. Is Ty.Danjuma the only one that have oil block.? You are trying to divert attention of the killings with no one arrested or prosecuted. God will judge the killers of Christians  in particular and Nigerians  in generation. God is on the throne.
2602 2018-06-23 17:57:16 Those globalists you speak of are by in large Americans. Monsanto, Big Oil, Big Pharma, Wall Street and on and on
2603 2018-06-23 17:57:13 How long do you think companies will be bullied before they stop listening
2604 2018-06-23 17:57:05 Yes ma’am. I used an old spray bottle. The Mario Badescu 8 OZ bottle, put about 2 tsp of either Aloe Vera or Glycerin (those have properties that make your makeup stay in place and stick) 1/2 cup of witch hazel, 1/2 cup of distilled or purified water, and an essential oil.
2605 2018-06-23 17:56:54 Take breakfast stuff,, easy on a grill/ or camp stove. Oil to fry fish if your gonna fish??? Pizza on grill is pretty damn good too.uch luck and don't forget to have FUN!! 
2606 2018-06-23 17:56:50 She reeks of baloney and patchouli oil.
2607 2018-06-23 17:56:49 Oil, not really done on purpose, but the birds will be super happy to nosh on it later.
2608 2018-06-23 17:56:47 Yo @VivoTranquil0 I made my own soap w/ Dr Bonner’s Castile Soap, peppermint and tea tree oil

2612 2018-06-23 17:56:31 Jeremy is the opposition to the Tory snake oil salesmen, like I said I really hope he starts to speak up now that jobs are in danger.
I like the guy and would vote for him again but it's just needs to start pointing out the consequences of brexit to people quick.
2613 2018-06-23 17:56:08 This is why I dip the Milk Duds in CBD oil.

2617 2018-06-23 17:55:59 Still a D backlog in CAR, Oil should be inquiring about Faulk.. if you can do it without including Nurse or RNH I say go for it
2618 2018-06-23 17:55:58 PR on steroids lol, have you seen the soap commercial saving oily ducks   don’t have too worry about tar/oil spills or tailings ponds lol
2619 2018-06-23 17:55:54 They have surfing, pierogis and an oil refinery
2620 2018-06-23 17:55:45 I don’t think I’ve ever been this excited about putting oil in my hair since I first got my deva curl blow dryer and products 
2621 2018-06-23 17:55:35 i wonder what would happen if 20 MILLION *WHITE PEOPLE*
invaded Mexico and confiscated all the
*Beach Front property
*Oil and Gas
*and Tequila

*demanded voting rights
*welfare
*and free healthcare

think the Mexicans would BUILD A WALL
2622 2018-06-23 17:55:07 highlight of my time in lagos: talking to somebody who’s life depends on the oil business and another who’s bringing solar energy to the forefront. #whew
2623 2018-06-23 17:55:06 Good luck to the CIM Oil Sands Branch with their #golf tournament today! We're wishing you light winds and long drives!
2624 2018-06-23 17:55:06 Almond oil & (surprisingly) olive oil are some good ones too. I use coconut oil for masks but rinse it out.

2628 2018-06-23 17:55:03 The solar industry is currently bigger than the coal, gas and oil industries combined. Trump is talking nonsense. Coal is a fuel of the past. Renewables are the future.

2630 2018-06-23 17:54:07 I wonder if the country of Norway has citizens who are lucky enough to be near the patch of oil who are unhappy to share the wealth with other citizens of the country of Norway. Like we have here in the country of Canada.
2631 2018-06-23 17:54:07 With respect Mr #Trump our continued reliance on oil is a major security risk. We must end our dependence on oil in order to be truly independent.
2632 2018-06-23 17:54:02 Just seen an advert for CBD oil on mainstream UK TV. Shame it's only hemp oil but I really see the tide turning now. Time for the canna community old and young to pull together and get this legalised once and for all. #cannabis #cbdoil #legaliseit
2633 2018-06-23 17:53:54 Monic Uriarte w/ @EsperanzaCHC tells how her community got sick & fought toxic emissions in University Park from the AllenCo oil field. They won a temp. shut down of the oil field but need our help to keep it closed. @STAND_LA works to make every neighborhood in LA safe from oil.
2634 2018-06-23 17:53:54 watching my dad change my oil and thinking why tf don’t i know how to do this 100% yet lol
2635 2018-06-23 17:53:53 Looks like she could use a good cabana man . Rub suntan lotion on .. rub oil in .. massage .. and aloe vera for later .. I'm available 
2636 2018-06-23 17:53:48 ほう
2637 2018-06-23 17:53:48 how about but Canadian oil? I take exception with the "Climate Barbie" handle. Should be Talking Barbie. pull the string and get random platitudes. you are an embarrassment and a Danger to this once great country. build pipelines buy Alberta CLEAN beautiful oil!

2640 2018-06-23 17:53:39 思わせぶりな態度をとる女の行動を見てあ、これは思わせぶりなやつだ！と思わないと……
2641 2018-06-23 17:53:37 its oil paint with lots and lots of shiny stuff on it LOL
2642 2018-06-23 17:53:33 Does that mean lettuce oil is also the worst.
2643 2018-06-23 17:53:27 In the midst of everything else this week, Donald Trump quietly signed an executive order designed essentially to promote the massive expansion of oil and natural gas drilling in the Great Lakes and the oceans immediately off our coastlines.
2644 2018-06-23 17:53:25 And this is the guy de facto running the country; a rabid and fanatic foe of the oil and gas sector which is a huge wealth creator in Canada. His arrogance exceeded only by his cynicism and hypocrisy. Prepare for a repeat of the Ontario ‘decimation’ at the federal level 
2645 2018-06-23 17:53:25 @RegalMovies I have recently learned your popcorn is vegan, but, as someone with multiple food allergies, can you give me more informatiin about the ingredient list? Such as the oil used? Thanks!

2649 2018-06-23 17:53:03 Iran sees little extra oil if OPEC, partners stick to deal: VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran said on Saturday the world will see little extra oil reaching the market if OPEC and its partners adhere properly to a supply pact, underlining a disagreement with top exporter Saudi Arabia.
2650 2018-06-23 17:52:57 君重いよねって質量の話か
2651 2018-06-23 17:52:44 Yup! Pero pag massage tinitiis ko yung oil. Lol.
2652 2018-06-23 17:52:28 I think at that point people need to look at the snake oil salesmen from 2016 (Gove, Farage, Johnson et al) and consider whether what they did was a) legal and b) in line with the standards associated with public office.
2653 2018-06-23 17:52:14 In 1970 this was the greenhouse effect. It was the republican "hero" Reagan who took Jimmy Carter's solar panels off the White House. We see what's right in front of us, we have for decades. But we can't do better because the tendrils of oil & coal run deep into politics. #Vote
2654 2018-06-23 17:52:07 Son of a beeeeeech...I have an oil leak. Good thing we’re towing my car to Wisco. 
2655 2018-06-23 17:51:49 i need a big bin of gesso, acrylic paints, oil paints and a few new brushes ):
2656 2018-06-23 17:51:45 I like to get chard or similar greens, do much of the prep at home (clean, chop, blanch in boiling water exactly 1 minute), then freeze them. When thawed, they only take 1 minute to saute in butter or the oil of your choice with a little salt and pepper. Heavenly.
2657 2018-06-23 17:51:36 Yes, it makes you think. Dread to think of comparing cost of op and trauma to child with cost of oil and no trauma to child.
2658 2018-06-23 17:51:35 FUCK DONALD TRUMP. How do you reverse the protections put in after the BP oil spill. That’s like removing all the protections implemented after 9/11. This world is going to end while we are all alive for it.
2659 2018-06-23 17:51:32 Back to more trivial thoughts: 
Me: why are nice things so expensive -longingly thinking about the ps4, the switch, the games, an oil diffuser, scented candles-

Me: have a good job, you have money in your account to pay for those things and a butt load of available credit.
2660 2018-06-23 17:51:07 I think some olive oil may have accidentally fallen on her head
2661 2018-06-23 17:51:00 Um... the bust was made by OPEC trying to drive US shale out of business by oversupply, crashing the price of oil in 2014, blowing a $10 billion hole in the PC budget, because they systemically lied about low taxes. It had nothing to do with anything happening in Canada.

2673 2018-06-23 17:49:33 thats why i always make sure to have my easel, canvas, and oil pants with me
2674 2018-06-23 17:49:26 Jev that kind of guy that doesn't oil his engine
2675 2018-06-23 17:49:16 i use a spray called oll nighter by urban decay,, there is a special one for oil control and it works great!!! skin never gets oily during a party
2676 2018-06-23 17:49:15 The truth is thus revealed! I just dropped $120 buying oil painting mediums and canvases on closeout

2678 2018-06-23 17:48:54 Water, cup of tea and a little song. Roll sole of your feet on tennis ball. Brazilian music in background, smile at baby & make simple pasta with herbs & olive oil. Collapse on sofa w/ glass of wine, pasta & baby & put on goofy film: Jerry Lewis or Louis de Funès. Sleep early.
2679 2018-06-23 17:48:50 So.... I woke up feeling a lil stiff, got up stretched out. Still felt stiff. Didn’t feel like leaving my apt to go to the sauna or hot yoga so I decided to take a hot bath. Ok so my lady friend left some bath oil here, she told me it helps w/ pruning.
2680 2018-06-23 17:48:43 i highly suggest broccoli, carrots, brussels sprouts, garlic, and snow/snap peas coated in olive oil and tossed with garlic powder or adobo seasoning and a lil sprinkle of cinnamon or cloves and broiled for like 10 minutes bc it’s SO GOOD
2681 2018-06-23 17:48:42 I love how these people all promise to eat at this restaurant.  They have no idea where Lexington VA is
2682 2018-06-23 17:48:40 with no formal training or teacher I have managed to sell a few pieces which has encouraged me to keep learning - I found you on YT as I was researching the use of Magic White etc as the base coat for blending - I am using Acrylics - I can't afford oil - cont'd
2683 2018-06-23 17:48:40 It’s an easy argument to disprove. More relevant to imperialism is the control of the flow of oil, direction of natural gas pipelines, etc. This is the major rub the US has with Iran in the Straight of Hormuz, and it’s one of the factors behind the bloodshed in Syria.
2684 2018-06-23 17:48:39 I think I have a slight addiction to avocado oil and kumbucha. It’s okay though
2685 2018-06-23 17:48:32 Same-ish...

Liberals in my native state of The People's Republic of California:  Secede from the Union!!!

California conservatives: Do it!  Do eeeet! Do it now!   We won't survive 4 minutes, but it will be fun watching you commies crash and burn!

2691 2018-06-23 17:47:51 I believe CBD oil will make a huge difference in peoples lives.  I feel as if people should give CBD oil a chance. It can benefit them in many ways.

2700 2018-06-23 17:46:49 I put together a fancy salad, and grabbed some delicious italian herb oil dressing for it. Turns out, the little spout plastic came off stuck in the cap. ... Now I have vegetable soup.

2704 2018-06-23 17:46:25 In order to maintain reliability they all need; spinning reserve, frequency response and frequency control.  Hydro is the only alternative energy that does all that.  When was the last hydro project started in this country?
2705 2018-06-23 17:46:15 Tell John, do you recall when it was revealed that Eamon Ryan held shares in BP, one of the worlds biggest oil producers ?? Is that just a memory of mine or was it real ?
2706 2018-06-23 17:46:10 Good afternoon.  May I encourage you to read of the original VAT Act and the Amendment. You will see that export of goods and services are zero rated and thus oil imported and any service of it for export is exempt from VAT in the original Act.  The Amendment provide clarity
2707 2018-06-23 17:46:10 Did all your members give up their cars, computers, etc that use oil? Until then, stop spouting what others do.  We need oil to do almost everything everyday. I will support Laxalt. Sisolak is MUCH WORSE.

2720 2018-06-23 17:45:13 If you read that history, you'll notice that both times the SPR was used were in situations where the flow of oil dramatically decreased because of war or natural disaster, not because the price was naturally rising.  Again, all I'm pointing out is that there is a better path.

2736 2018-06-23 17:43:54 @HowtowithKeila 

Hi Keila, I was just watching some of your YouTube videos on making your own essential oils.  If you wanted to use something different like, mint, or lemon for example to infuse your oil how do you know how much of it to use?
2737 2018-06-23 17:43:51 Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.

2738 2018-06-23 17:43:43 Yes but I have to be very careful with oils because they're high in protein. I'm about ready to start playing with some concentrated aloe vera powder. If I can eat it it's safe. Coconut oil is one of the highest for allergic reaction topically. Love Shea Butter though

2740 2018-06-23 17:43:23 They want us to become pro-oil.

The concept that QC doesn't use it's resources is ridiculous, from asbestos to Alcan to forestry.  The only resource AB cares about is oil.

This is all EnergyEast BS, because AB would go bananas if QC seriously ramped up O&G production & competed

2742 2018-06-23 17:43:15 The part she mentioned - messing up the global oil supply - is something they can do, even if we don’t buy much of their oil directly. That by itself is not going to be catastrophic to the US. But there are definitely other “asymmetric” things they can pull off.
2743 2018-06-23 17:43:14 How does IOC makes profit?  I can't comprehend anymore. If it's like this I suggest we abandon oil for another thing like quarry etc  I can't think anymore

2830 2018-06-23 17:33:53 I read an article on this and it said that other crude can take the place of Syncrude in the pipeline but it's a different weight of oil. So the amount of oil might not change - more the type. 360,000 BPD sounds pretty small to make such a change - jittery.

2837 2018-06-23 17:33:20 Who got the Mitsubishi connect need oil filters
2838 2018-06-23 17:33:07 I've studied the politics of climate change fairly closely. There are clear easily-traceable financial links between climate change sceptics/deniers and big oil + clear financial incentives for scientists to criticize the "alarmist" consensus.

2841 2018-06-23 17:32:52 Such a careless idiot sometimes. While making dinner, I splashed hot oil all over my arm. I have blisters 
2842 2018-06-23 17:32:48 Oooo no papers today for me - what did he say?
2843 2018-06-23 17:32:43 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.

2848 2018-06-23 17:32:09 I really missed #SambitPatra in my @TimesNow debate tonight. They should get him from #BJP when they call me. I love debating doctors who have become oil company directors.
2849 2018-06-23 17:31:58 they’re upset about everything... for some reason.
2850 2018-06-23 17:31:55 NIGERIA

90% of the population live on less than $2 a day
world's 5th largest exporter of oil
2851 2018-06-23 17:31:49 Exactly! The eye reads finite details last. Construct things like you would a an oil painting.
2852 2018-06-23 17:31:37 Seems like relevant information to know where the train originated. I'm assuming that's why it's mentioned. The anti-oil people will be upset regardless — it's an oil spill.
2853 2018-06-23 17:31:28 Height of incompetence a person who cannot provide Justice to the country has taken the responsibility to straighten up the import of oil. Saqib Nisar even does not know how many millions are there in a lac or vice versa. He is bound to destroy Pakistan before January 2019.
2854 2018-06-23 17:31:05 Yo lo que se es que comprabas hoy ..a fin de mes o a fin de año y no variaban los precios...el gas oil 0.28cvs de dolar...cuanto seria con un dolar a 28?menos de 9 mangos...ahora 30$...no era igual....ni a palos..este es muchisimo peor y por lejos...mi marido era camionero.
2855 2018-06-23 17:30:57 Quebec has developed a large energy industry and offers energy domestically at a discount. They can do that because it's a provincial utility.  

Just because they developed hydro instead of oil/gas doesn't mean they didn't develop their resources.
2856 2018-06-23 17:30:53 I provided my list right there

2859 2018-06-23 17:30:21 Dear #TOYOTA,
We made an appointment for an oil change. Even with an appointment, we were told it could take 2 hours. We’ve been here for 3 hours and were told our car was just going in. What have appointments? This is ridiculous! #pissed #wastedmyday – bij AutoNation Toyota Parts Department Warehouse
2860 2018-06-23 17:30:20 I have an elder cat w/ intractable IBS. Vet recommended euthanasia 2 yrs ago or so. Started CBD oil instead. He's not listed as intractable anymore,and rules the house.
Have started 2 dogs on it as well. 1 high anxiety, helps a lot. 1 Cushings, will know more at next blood test.

Bloody hell she'll be smug all day now....
2864 2018-06-23 17:30:00 This is when "womp womp" is the correct response. And then an offer to find a baker that will bake a cake for them.

2873 2018-06-23 17:28:40 We need to produce more oil and force them to bring down the price. They will if we don't buy from them.
2874 2018-06-23 17:28:36 I’ll buy you some coconut oil. Makes our skin look exquisite 
2875 2018-06-23 17:28:28 You foul ugly man... your lies and snake oil sale schemes are gonna do you in ... the world is watching ...
2876 2018-06-23 17:28:10 @Dontvoteliberal @globalnews Quebec should include Hydro in the have part of the =izationequation. They sell it to the US like oil.
2877 2018-06-23 17:28:07 I don't ever ask for Help but if you want to buy any of my merch, cds, tshirts, hats, oil cartridges (local only), or a ticket to my next show July 20th it would really help me out right now.
2878 2018-06-23 17:27:34 “WAAAAHHHHHH I dont have any money and neither should you!” Eff that, I love capitalism. Why is it our fault these people refuse to better themselves?
2879 2018-06-23 17:27:25 An oil change should not take a damn hour
2880 2018-06-23 17:27:13 try coconut oil and then use micellar water!

2886 2018-06-23 17:26:26 Every person working in the Oil & Gas industry should study and know exactly what happened on Piper Alpha. Highly recommend reading the minute by minute account leading up to the accident. Much value can be gained.
2887 2018-06-23 17:26:24 Any recommendations for the best tanning oil?

2935 2018-06-23 17:21:02 Russia has an oil based economy.  Russia reaped the rewards of pulling out of the Iran deal.

2951 2018-06-23 17:18:57 2/ Alberta still leads the country for the combination of growth, GDP per capita, median household income and low taxes. Our oil and gas production is way higher than 2009. Still no PST, still low royalty rates. AB NDP govt facing a federal Lib government - no love lost. But
2952 2018-06-23 17:18:51 I assure you. If we tied aid, oil and arms sales as well as investments in state security, into requirements for political change  - women would be as free as they are here. Religious peoples would be free and we'd see amazing economic gains.

2960 2018-06-23 17:17:36 also applies to @lisamurkowski - privileges her supporters, ignores invitations from those with different ideas, no free open forums since nov 2016, no person answers her phone, selling democracy/justice for oil by account of her actions.
2961 2018-06-23 17:17:27 Because we need dollar....& With high exchange rate our loss is higher.
For eg. Our govt has to pay in dollars for crude oil and so we need to buy dollars in exchange for rupees so the higher is the exchange rate the more we will lose.
And this is same for everything we import
2962 2018-06-23 17:17:17 Oh yeah LOL. I think I had in my head the spy who loved me was about oil?? But didn’t the villain in TSWLM just want to destroy the world and live underwater?

2969 2018-06-23 17:16:10 finally getting an oil change after almost a year of having my car 
2970 2018-06-23 17:16:10 Yeah I do. Just put coconut oil on your brows when you’re taking it off. It’ll loosen up the gel

2973 2018-06-23 17:15:53 which essential oil cures sadness ??!
2974 2018-06-23 17:15:48 What planet are you on?
2975 2018-06-23 17:15:38 It is most definitely NOT a trade issue. It is an EXISTENTIAL attack given the importance of oil to the Japanese economy and the survival of its people. In my opinion, the embargo *intentionally* provoked war.
2976 2018-06-23 17:15:31 A room without books is a body without soul. A mind needs books just as an engine needs oil. That's why I read so much.

2977 2018-06-23 17:15:30 I went in a repair shop to get a oil change in my car and what I got was a BLOWN ENGINE! Someone told me about a company that got me a check for the value of my car, a new engine and other parts. If you have had legal problems too and need help check out my home page.
2978 2018-06-23 17:15:30 Oh, and it is Britain's oil - paid for with years of investment from British taxpayers.

How 5 million Scots think they have a right to blackmail the rest of us into staying in an EU dictatorship modelled on the Chinese one-party-state system is beyond me.

2986 2018-06-23 17:14:43 Please don't put oil or anything greasy on the pole. If the birds brush it and the grease gets on their feathers, their flight abilities and insulation are ruined and they need wildlife rehab. A slinky on the pole is a much safer alternative.

2993 2018-06-23 17:13:48 Wash your hair & deep condition it twice a week if it’s really bad. Use cooking oil to base your scalp every 2-3 days.
2994 2018-06-23 17:13:48 You guys I’m getting a whole oil change just so they can put air in my tires
2995 2018-06-23 17:13:44 Swordfish. Garlic, lime, chilli oil, sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger, sherry and sake. Let's see how this turns out.
2996 2018-06-23 17:13:37 I get really annoyed at the directions of cooking food. It always says add oil. This is not always necessary as meat can cook in its own fat! Latest one was @AldiUK burgers with cheese. It doesn't need oil as loads come out!!
2997 2018-06-23 17:13:28 the amount of oil and unhealthiness it consists of ew
2998 2018-06-23 17:13:26 Do you understand what cutting off their oil supply *meant*? Your comment makes it seem like it was a slap on the wrist rather than the *intolerable* provocation it represented. The US government understood this.
2999 2018-06-23 17:13:24 In that case, it could compete without the carbon tax, too. The carbon tax is insurance against low oil prices amidst slumping demand and future road use taxes. But can you go all day without losing payload?

So hindi na pala
3004 2018-06-23 17:13:06 So you all live “oil free” lives?! Of course you don’t, hypocrites. NIMBYs.
3005 2018-06-23 17:12:55 Oh. Don’t be so gullible.  Obama never protected the gulf from harm . And Trump hasn’t endangered it.  It’s way more complicated. More than likely, like everything else he did, Obama probably sold out to some solar energy company to shut down the oil industry without any facts.
3006 2018-06-23 17:12:52 This is much less important than it sounds. If the US were currently in the midst of a recession (1970, 1982), or on the verge of a recession and suffering from an oil price shock (1990), Trump’s numbers even among the GOP would be significantly lower.
3007 2018-06-23 17:12:52 This is always going to happen. FK oil! You dummies.! Get over the oil industry. Boats keep leaks thousands of gallons in the ocean. Now trains. Wtf!!!
3008 2018-06-23 17:12:50 seems so, yes
3009 2018-06-23 17:12:41 The #EnergyEast pipeline should be under construction right now.

Instead, Canada continues to spend billions on foreign oil that doesn’t meet our local environmental standards.

This project was already 70% in the ground and is a huge lost economic + nation building opportunity.

3017 2018-06-23 17:12:15 “Saudis, Saying They Heard Price Complaints, Are Raising Oil Production” title from New York Times. Article reads as though we will be swimming in oil. This is the problem with consensus view that dominates the oil sector. Nowhere does it say that the 1 million barrel increase..
3018 2018-06-23 17:12:13 We are autistics. We appear to have evolved to take in and process far more sensory stimulus than most allistics.  It's no wonder that we often get overloaded in a world built by and for non-autistics! 
I'm okay with wet - it's the tiniest bit of grease/oil that I just can't.
3019 2018-06-23 17:12:01 That’s why I change the oil myself
3020 2018-06-23 17:11:53 God's shifting the oil in the form of natural disasters.
3021 2018-06-23 17:11:48 Agreed.

Basil, olive oil, garlic, pine nuts, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, salt, pepper, lemon juice.

Blended heavily.

But seriously though... drinking gallons of oil?!?
3023 2018-06-23 17:11:37 All oil and gas workers will lose their jobs. A dead industry that has pretty much ruined the environment and planet.

3030 2018-06-23 17:10:52 @Walmart must be doing the most in depth oil changes today. I was told my wait would be over four hours.
3031 2018-06-23 17:10:50 Ditto... never had it properly serviced, but I do change the oil annually and do bits of light DIY TLC on it. Never missed a beat.

3036 2018-06-23 17:10:23 I’d like to see you do that. Also, keep picking on Canada-your “ally”, and we cut your oil. See how that works for you. But then...maybe you’ll say we have wmd’s and invade...

3048 2018-06-23 17:09:04 This is why GOP will keep the house and Trump will be a two term President. They are pushing the moderates who didn’t vote for Trump into his camp. They aren’t woke enough to realize they are writing his campaign ads.

3064 2018-06-23 17:07:20 The supply of oil is so vast at the moment I don’t think they can affect the price much. Russia needs higher oil prices badly. If they manage to get oil higher it will be part of The Trump/Putin plan.
3065 2018-06-23 17:07:11 Once again your full of it. Majority of the American farming industry is automated.  Not everyone a saint, but just so you know if you own anything made with plastic like your phone you are promoting the oil industries and wars created for the purpose of securing such resources.

3087 2018-06-23 17:04:11 What a dumb headline. Obama signed an executive order that was overeaching and stifled energy companies. It's still illegal to dump oil in the ocean or great lakes. Nothing has changed except for the fact that he got rid of a useless government committee
3088 2018-06-23 17:03:59 Think SP it's gonna do very well off the hype and excitement- I hope it will do well in reality but it is high risk imho most Chris Oil stocks I heard him tip in 2015 absolutely tanked and he then disappeared for a while #blcc

3099 2018-06-23 17:02:51 I thought it was really a war for oil.  Or as revenge for 9/11.  Or as revenge for Bush's fantasy that Saddam had tried to assassinate his father.  Or just as expansion of US hegemony in the Middle East.  It was certainly overdetermined ...
3100 2018-06-23 17:02:45 Your info is wrong. Pooja Singh is using pure Indian Petrol in her scooty. This petrol is prepared in

3112 2018-06-23 17:01:09 Dept of Trans estimates at an avg mileage of 25 mpg, a single #EV can displace about 468 gallons of gas per yr, or 25 Barrels of #oil
With our #EV I think I calculated we displace 32 barrels of oil!

3116 2018-06-23 17:00:48 I love Neem oil  I wish it smelled a bit more pleasant though.
3117 2018-06-23 17:00:40 Can we agree that preventing a country from accessing oil and thereby shutting down its industry/economy doesn't leave them much choice? What do you think the US would do if some country were capable of shutting off its oil supply? Wars usually start *before* the first shot.

3120 2018-06-23 17:00:35 Pray tell , whose oil is it ? Can you point me to a link confirming that my argument was dismantled ? Being a partner in the Eu is better than being a part of the U.K. not a partner .
3121 2018-06-23 17:00:27 And you know what? I’d buy a palm oil candle

3123 2018-06-23 17:00:24 Lol actually he asked me if i had been to cooking school. Used the few ingredients i could find in nearby town. Lemon, mixed herbs, aromat, black pepper and oil. Kept basting to keep it juicy. Your verdict?
3124 2018-06-23 17:00:21 ARE CHEAP OIL CHANGES GOOD FOR THE CAR?

When planning to get an oil change, people always look for a cheaper option thinking it doesn’t make much difference. 
TYPES OF OILS
There are basically two major types of oils regular oil and synthetic oil. Regular oil is distilled an

"If we allocated the number pro-rata basis among the 24 countries, it had been estimated that about 60 percent will be achieved,” Al-Falih said. “But because we went away from allocation on a pro-rata basis, we will be closer to 1 mln than to 600k bpd."

3147 2018-06-23 16:58:06 First time at this mechanic for an change oil and I’m LOVING it! Twice now he’s called me from the waiting room to show me things with my car. I’ve now seen my brakes for the very first time and he showed me evidence of an oil leak.

3149 2018-06-23 16:57:41 There’s nothing more painful than cooking stew/frying chicken and the stew/oil pops onto your hand
3150 2018-06-23 16:57:35 So, shipping massive tankers of oil from roughly halfway across the planet causes less pollution than producing it locally and delivering it via pipeline. Okay. Sure.

3160 2018-06-23 16:55:58 Oh well shit happens and oil is way more important than water right? Guess all those regulations to prevent this type of thing weren’t really needed right Scott Pruitt?

3164 2018-06-23 16:54:25 That is reverse actually. When they flood the market like they did in 2015_2016 prices went down but millions in America lost jobs. Billions of dollars were lost and American oil destroyed.

3171 2018-06-23 16:53:21 We'll do this. 

And since Trump tore up NAFTA, we will also start nationalizing American pharmaceutical patents, like we used to before NAFTA. The power of the US pharmaceutical lobby is greater than all other industries combined. And that includes defence and oil/gas.

3173 2018-06-23 16:53:04 not giving me a discount on my oil change during pride month is bi-erasure
3174 2018-06-23 16:53:03 We don't want OPEC to increase we want them to decrease so we can export more! Drill more and build more offshore rigs. You are a great businessman but obviously aren't aware that we hold.more oil in reserves and untapped than anyone in the world. We are the leader!
3175 2018-06-23 16:52:59 Yeah that’s what somebody told me. Every 3 Days i wash my hair and do the leave in conditoner and slap the oil in that ho
3176 2018-06-23 16:52:33 1/ This is probably the most corrupt administration ever. Commerce secretary owns large amounts of foreign assets and shorts stock when asked for a quote about it. EPA chief in bed with oil industry and won’t release details of who he meets with, wasting tax money on fancy pants.
3177 2018-06-23 16:52:29 There may be but I don’t know. But if you use the oil tonight and tomorrow, by the end of tomorrow you’d sure see a difference

3183 2018-06-23 16:52:18 It would still take 5 - 10 years to see a profit while in the meantime just one oil spill would kill tourism, a major source of Greek income.
But what do I know?

3184 2018-06-23 16:52:17 Please look hemp oil and what it does to blood cells please research it . There has been people who have used it with success. What have you got to lose it's worthwhile researching..all the best thinking of you
3185 2018-06-23 16:52:09 Image that! 31 American States & Canada now legalize de weed! Medical marijuana is big business but Jamaica lagging behind monetizing this opportunity.

3193 2018-06-23 16:51:27 Have had mine for six years. To my shame I have never had it serviced or even changed the oil. After a winter in a damp shed it has always started on the second or third pull, on stale fuel. I don't deserve it.
3194 2018-06-23 16:51:27 yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all a conspiracy. Oil is still down around $68/barrel and OPEC is upping production while the US cuts rig count. Greece would have to partner with a company for exploration and drilling, giving away a large portion of profits 1/2
3195 2018-06-23 16:51:24 That is precisely how you need to debate these people. Agree with everything liberals say they will twist themselves into knots. Example, trump thanks the fbi for spies in his campaign 2 protect against foreign influence and vowes to protect future campaigns the same way. Popcorn
3196 2018-06-23 16:51:23 Any kind of oil. I use tap oil, but even veggie oil would help worst case

3206 2018-06-23 16:50:19 Definitely the Phoenix oil and the blue clay mask. I love the jade facial roller and people are obsessed with the tansy mask(I haven’t tried it). They have a mini oil set that is awesome too.

3209 2018-06-23 16:50:12 Doesn’t have to end that way...pretty sure you could find another 80 with 2/80 ac. Can always customize so oil press is the only working gauge.
3210 2018-06-23 16:49:59 False.  Granted certainly very far from a perfect science on player eval at this age.  Also can become function of other teams decisions --- Oil kind of an extreme version with Jesse and now Evan falling into hands.

3213 2018-06-23 16:49:41 That one was dismantled a long time ago.  And it won't just be Scotland's oil. Don't forget that oil will become increasingly redundant as alternative fuels, propulsion systems & materials are developed over the next 20 years.

Leaving the UK to be bossed by the EU is illogical
3214 2018-06-23 16:49:37 I need to get my oil changed, but I don’t wanna drop the $90+ to have it done.

3220 2018-06-23 16:49:17 You need to read up on the weeks and months preceding the attack on Pearl Harbor. It's difficult for an objective person not to conclude the US government didn't *intentionally* provoke the attack. Japanese ambassadors virtually begged the US to lift the oil embargo.
3221 2018-06-23 16:49:14 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
3222 2018-06-23 16:49:11 True!

Based on ratings of pundits heading in... thru 2 rounds... it looks like Oil have knocked it out of park for second year in a row.

In fairness, this is Chiarelli’s fourth draft, I think he’s done a great job adding talent to organization.

Credit where it’s due!
3223 2018-06-23 16:49:11 If you don’t have an essential oil diffuser, please get one. I assure you it’s a life changer.
3224 2018-06-23 16:49:10 First game 201.  Not too bad.  This oil patterns is very similar to the PBA Cheetah.  Almost exactly.

3226 2018-06-23 16:48:11 The formula is and has always been slanted in Quebec’s favor and against provinces that have resource based economies. Hydro and oil based revenue should be treated the same.

3235 2018-06-23 16:47:28 Scott, here's the thing, are you so sure that 97% of scientists are wrong that you'd gamble with humanity's future? Even if coal and oil aren't contributing to climate change, there is no question they are health hazards. Why pollute if we don't have too?
3236 2018-06-23 16:47:25 All Modi's actions from day one are to teach people to be involved in nation building, as citizens - rights & responsibilities, both.

3251 2018-06-23 16:45:07 Russia cannot do too much directly to the US barring military attack. They’re not significant trade partners, we don’t depend on their oil, etc. But they can do a lot to the Trump-Kushner family kleptocracy.
3252 2018-06-23 16:45:04 ละแม้ว่าเธอเคยรักเขาหมดหัวใจไม่เป็นไรฮันเข้าใจเสทอ
3253 2018-06-23 16:44:56 lmao i forgot to take my microwave out of my car before my oil change. they’re probably thinking “why does this kid have a microwave in his car.”
3254 2018-06-23 16:44:48 “Fill’er up and check the oil, please”
3255 2018-06-23 16:44:44 @WhiteHouse @PressSec @StateDept IMO al-Hussein has no credibility.Salafist ,wahabbi ideology keeps most Woman as bedroom,kitchen slaves, unable to Vote or Free Speech. Sunni wahabbi sheiks finance Daesh & now #OPEC in collusion cuts Oil supplies for $100 barrel,Jihad gangsters
3256 2018-06-23 16:44:37 Only a fuck boy would have gotten offended by my original comment. Btw. Beard oil helps that shit grow.
3257 2018-06-23 16:44:31 So the value of oil which their Econemy and the sanctions on it played no part... okay
3258 2018-06-23 16:44:26 INSIDE EDGE: MEDIUM OIL USING BOASTFUL BACKMASKING TO CONTROL THE SHAMSELFLY!?!?!
3259 2018-06-23 16:44:23 Aren’t you cute. Are you a bot? Do you need a little oil?
3260 2018-06-23 16:44:23 Yes buying oil from Arabs works out so well
3261 2018-06-23 16:44:06 There's NO WAY you can be 'fully rested.' Please try my CBD oil when you're back.
3262 2018-06-23 16:43:52 Saudis; *thick Arab accent*

3263 2018-06-23 16:43:47 Have you tried just raw coconut oil?
3264 2018-06-23 16:43:44 @sajidjavid @theresa_may 115,000 of us are calling on you to legalise medicinal cannabis oil, promising a review is not enough. Public support is behind us, change this law and save lives! #MedicalCannabisNow

3267 2018-06-23 16:43:00 田所ハンパないって！
3268 2018-06-23 16:42:59 Printing fiat currency and being addicted to somebody's oil is a great way to brag about how great and powerful you are.
3269 2018-06-23 16:42:58 Thought the same thing coming out the oil change
3270 2018-06-23 16:42:58 my ear was stabbing last night, so I figured it was neuralgia. today it's kind of pulsing, but random pulses, so I poured oil into it and it seemed to stop, so I guess that means there's probably a dead bug in my ear. life is hard
3271 2018-06-23 16:42:19 Let us know when they aren't living with any steel (incl firearms) or petroleum products.
3272 2018-06-23 16:42:17 แต่ทั้งหัวใจก็ยังเป็นของเธอคนดี
3273 2018-06-23 16:42:17 Use tea tree oil and vitamin E oil girl
3274 2018-06-23 16:42:03 IA tragedy brings to mind big oil guys salivating to drill off the coast of some of most beautiful beaches in U.S. It’ll be a spill waiting to happen, & so much worse than Iowa’s. Nat’l parks now in same danger. Wind farms are future, not oil wells.
3275 2018-06-23 16:41:52 why not ask your oil producing friends to increase production in US.
3276 2018-06-23 16:41:50 Wow if only this event was on Mars everyone can come and jumping up and down celebration time come on on Mars directing our children into falsehood asinine drink some oil and kick the ball 
3277 2018-06-23 16:41:49 Tapi beli face oil ntr di shopee. Walah.
3278 2018-06-23 16:41:42 Also factor in the $70 Billion that Mexicans living in the USA send home each year. That's more revenue than Mexico generates from oil exports.
3279 2018-06-23 16:41:42 This viejo sprayed some CBD oil under my tongue. Not sure if he’s a hypnotist or a good salesman...
3280 2018-06-23 16:41:30 They've been guessing for a couple of hrs now 
3281 2018-06-23 16:41:08 here’s hoping the guys changing the oil in my car today remember me from HS and give me a discount 
3282 2018-06-23 16:40:55 Yellow breadfruit, roll bush, green seasoning, and pig tail...yes ah went market...yes today is oil dong!
3283 2018-06-23 16:40:52 Already doing this in Oil companies
3284 2018-06-23 16:40:40 Health Tips: find out the oxidation index of the oil you cook with, and choose the lowest number combined with the highest smoke point.
3285 2018-06-23 16:40:35 Its diameter saddled mysterious inside an oil sooner than my crest.
3286 2018-06-23 16:40:34 (Or switch to sustainable palm oil) Boycott is not the answer.
3287 2018-06-23 16:40:21 we turning this crud oil to fire
3288 2018-06-23 16:40:20 Just changed the oil on my Harley, Lucy,  for the first time.
3289 2018-06-23 16:40:16 One of my girls was like Ms. your hair smells like coconut oil & shea butter.. I used Garnier fructis conditionar in it! I NEVER use coconut oil or Shea butter. 
3290 2018-06-23 16:40:15 OPEC Members Plan to Substantially Increase Oil Production
3291 2018-06-23 16:40:14 People who think they can control the climate make me LOL.

3294 2018-06-23 16:40:10 they cooked fries in oil used from the chicken they fried earlier
3295 2018-06-23 16:39:49 I use that Jamaican castor oil!! Is that cool????
3296 2018-06-23 16:39:36 The downside to this diet is that you can't drown the potatoes in butter or olive oil, which makes them very yummy. Otherwise I'd love to try it. I adore potatoes. Although I don't think I'm Irish. Which I will find out soon enough!
3297 2018-06-23 16:39:31 It's shitty we separate families (supposedly, I'm sure they're deported together). But it's even worse when we blow up families in poor countries with oil.
3298 2018-06-23 16:39:31 u kno am gonna make a sweet ass tea full of veggies just so I can cleanse my body of sin

hey u peppers watch out ur about to get covered in olive oil n paprika
3299 2018-06-23 16:39:22 Collapse of the world oil price was nothing to do with? Or the total lack of Venezuela's government to save for a rainy day? Sure, mate. It's all a huge conspiracy.
3300 2018-06-23 16:39:21 #MiraclesOfGodKabir
Kabir Parmatma Ji put by Sheikh takhi in front of the people in the embroidery of boiling oil....
But the oil could not burn them..... Because he was God Himself.....
For more information, See-
Sadhna channel from 7:30 pm.
3301 2018-06-23 16:39:17 the value of oil dropped massively and sanctions made it difficult to export
3302 2018-06-23 16:39:14 What happened to America First? Oh you can’t make enough oil to keep prices down?
3303 2018-06-23 16:39:09 His works are pretty nice. The silhouette guy with bright eyes motif is kinda cool and creepy at the same time. Creepy bc oil man cool bc u can project urself onto him and be part of the illustrations.

3305 2018-06-23 16:38:49 Agreed and It's part of the reason I had such issue with them seemingly going out of their way to not get picks at the deadline and instead focus on the likes of Aberg. #MoreBullets
3306 2018-06-23 16:38:37 is er geen oil ofso die baard laat groeien

3308 2018-06-23 16:37:52 drop the murray’s just get some vitamin e oil or coconut oil 
3309 2018-06-23 16:37:30 need to find a good oil for my hair because  shit get dry so fast
3310 2018-06-23 16:37:19 Get some citronella oil and mix with water and spray in the area. #askyourvetfriend 
3311 2018-06-23 16:37:19 It would be much worse than Lac-Mégantic if it involved an oil tanker carrying 650 000 barrels of toxic sludge while traveling through the Burrard Inlet & Metro Vancouver...one of North America’s most densely populated cities.
3312 2018-06-23 16:37:15 Too convenient that it was a trainload of crude oil and just happened to be crossing a river. Likely its terrorist sabotage.
3313 2018-06-23 16:37:08 Reasons I HATE going to car places alone:
1) today, I said “I need an oil change” and an old man replied “does your car need one too?”. Cackled, then winked
3314 2018-06-23 16:36:53 OPEC was likely reading the writing on the wall, namely, that domestic producers here were ramping up production with the rising prices. The US will soon be the world's largest oil producer, thanks to OPEC, and Pres Trump.
3315 2018-06-23 16:36:47 Working on our 10+ year old pressure washer today. Took off carb to clean it, replaced fuel line, drained oil and still have to change the spark plug and adjust the valves. Called it on account of rain. My excuse & I'm sticking with it.

3317 2018-06-23 16:36:36 Have fun with your #market....I think #cocoa should do well...the #world needs lots of #coffeebeans and #oil can go to hell! I can do it you know? Become incredibly rich!
3318 2018-06-23 16:36:32 It depends. If the parent stays sometimes it makes it worse 
3319 2018-06-23 16:36:31 Does anybody have any experience with CBD oil for the treatment of anxiety and depression? Can you take it with anti depressants? 
Thanks in advance.
3320 2018-06-23 16:36:29 Pretty much, but i am anti-water on that method. Had i time to elaborate. On very greasy pizza use nothing. If not as greasy, a touch of oil or garlic butter.
3321 2018-06-23 16:36:19 Current state??? 
How many times has this same corporate oil $pon$ored media used propoganda images of childeren to "justify" wars across the world?

3333 2018-06-23 16:35:19 I love tea tree oil for blemishes! I usually mix in some lavender as well.

3335 2018-06-22 23:59:39 It’s been like a month. It ain’t that serious for me shampoo, coconut oil, and a brush does wonders.

3341 2018-06-22 23:58:32 I only use Shea butter & Coconut Oil on my skin. 
3342 2018-06-22 23:58:26 Texas and Oklahoma oil drillers won’t be happy either.
3343 2018-06-22 23:58:19 my apartment went from a bachelor pad with a sixty inch tv and bed to three salt lamps, an oil diffuser in every room, weighted blankets all over the place, and god damn mirrors everywhere
3344 2018-06-22 23:57:52 But only because the United States has oil and heavy metals.

3351 2018-06-22 23:56:48 No you’re fine! I was saying that the two ingredients sound similar! Squalene is typically derived from shark liver oil while squalene is usually derived from it but often times then not it’s the plant based version which is super important to my cruelty free/vegan clients!

3371 2018-06-22 23:56:13 a dude at the gym rn has the MOST beautiful, shiny, & longest hair I’ve seen on a human

bet he uses coconut oil
3372 2018-06-22 23:56:07 Still haven’t decided which former Edmonton Oil King we should pick with our first pick
3373 2018-06-22 23:55:45 It was awesome.. Literally we dont need big oil or cars that run on gas. Screw that noise.
3374 2018-06-22 23:55:41 -that could be seen was two red, piercing eyes that now stared at the intruder. 

What was most important though, was a large metal can of oil spilled on the ground. The dent indicates that's what made the noise earlier.

"Ah, you're that person who was approaching earlier. Now-

3377 2018-06-22 23:55:20 You get oil for head baba
3378 2018-06-22 23:55:11 Mine was minuscule. Then gasoline and food prices went up. So much for that. And now, big oil and food middlemen are even richer. THANKS TRUMP!!!
3379 2018-06-22 23:54:52 I’m really mad. I pulled my outfit out to get dressed and it’s some kinda oil stain right on the front of my top ....and I didn’t bring a backup 
3380 2018-06-22 23:54:35 And that looks like olive oil 
3381 2018-06-22 23:54:31 Manage it through sound, peppermint oil, google earth
3382 2018-06-22 23:54:29 God’s not real, the Bible is fiction, @JoelOsteen is a snake oil salesman and business is booming
3383 2018-06-22 23:54:26 I would also consider topical application of myrrh mixed with aloe or organic peanut oil.
3384 2018-06-22 23:54:25 Puppet-master? No. Co-conspirators? Yeah, definitely a few of those hanging about. Trump is just doing what he’s been doing all along. Only difference now is that he’s got government assistance w/selling snake oil.
3385 2018-06-22 23:54:24 I wonder if Alex Jones has weaponised the snake oil supplements he flogs to turn people into morons?
3386 2018-06-22 23:54:21 1. You hope?
2. Taking Iranian oil out of the market isn't affecting anything, is it?
#FuckingMoron
3387 2018-06-22 23:54:03 There was an oil spill in a river in Iowa but no (human) lives were lost, ppl just had to evacuate, fuck this world.
3388 2018-06-22 23:53:55 There’s no such thing as a sensible Brexit. You’re a snake oil salesman.
3389 2018-06-22 23:53:17 I was going to buy two new tires, two new hubcaps, and a new rear view mirror too. They were gonna get some money from me regardless, but after they were flippant about this I'll change the oil myself and spend the cash elsewhere.
3390 2018-06-22 23:53:02 No, vegetable oil is always first hmph

Just the start with 6yrs to go
3393 2018-06-22 23:52:33 Hm, can't explain the latter, sorry.

The former is no sauce at all, really.  Olive oil base, w/ some mozz and a light sriacha drizzle.

Mighty tasty.
3394 2018-06-22 23:52:31 These were just samples. They were too big for our roads. We run "very" expensive hybrids.  Remember we burn oil for most of our electricity. Highest price in the US.
3395 2018-06-22 23:52:24 My master is about oil palm sensor use inductive methods
3396 2018-06-22 23:52:07 I suspect Saudi and Russia will have a more aggressive rhetoric tomorrow to signal greater oil production. Today’s price action would have surprised them and concerned Saudi in particular with respect to U.S. presidential reaction. #OOTT

3398 2018-06-22 23:51:15 In oil breakthrough does not work 90% of all times, because Paul Tudor used to take part of the profit on breakthroughs and price moves towards breakthrough direction only after slight drawdown. You can read his method of trading oil in his interview to Jack Schwager.
3399 2018-06-22 23:50:45 I have to agree with the article TBH. Stovetop popcorn with too much oil = delicious perfection.
3400 2018-06-22 23:50:22 OPEC reaches deal to raise oil output
3401 2018-06-22 23:50:08 1 like and I'll check the oil in my car
3402 2018-06-22 23:50:04 How many oil changes you car has had since creation
3403 2018-06-22 23:50:03 I know my fiancée’s car (not from Tempe autoplex) has free oil changes for under 60k but they also told her you have X amount so we knew what to expect. Honestly, you’re looking to get one more oil change. They could have just comped it or at least marked it down a lot.
3404 2018-06-22 23:50:02 OPEC NOTE THAT there are MILLIONS of Syrian Refugees.  Trump took in 13 Syrian refugees.  Do NOT increase production to subsidize Trump political support. Set up Multi Nation Trust & fund to support Jesuit effort leadership in helping Syrian Refugees. Market price oil only
3405 2018-06-22 23:50:01 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
3406 2018-06-22 23:50:00 I suppose we Will be buying oil from 'out good friends ' the Russians soon
3407 2018-06-22 23:49:56 I'm not sold in the least on them taking a D man with the pick but we shall see who is left.
3408 2018-06-22 23:49:51 The implication is we could use the same money to invest in huge clean energy projects instead of a dirty oil source, gaining all the jobs that go with it. Not a huge mental leap if you toss the bias.
3409 2018-06-22 23:49:44 Lots of oil is OK 
3410 2018-06-22 23:49:36 Yeah but without oil they wouldn't be an investment company no? At the end of the day their sugar daddies
3411 2018-06-22 23:49:14 I can spell it out. Coal power, Oil replacing wood and whale oil brought railroads, cars, Coal powered shipping, rail, to replace wind power, walking and horses.
heated homes. Air conditioning. 
Stuff like that.
3412 2018-06-22 23:49:12 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
3413 2018-06-22 23:49:09 #SOCONNED by a snake oil salesman, its incredibly sad to watch the devotion of dear leader when his policies will hurt manority of Americans.
3414 2018-06-22 23:49:08 Protip: News can be found outside of cable channels and snake oil salesmen.
3415 2018-06-22 23:48:47 What are other state governors doing outside sharing Noodles, Tea, Oranges as empowerment packages. A viable garment industry to export to the USA will revive our textile industry. Most governors across the niger cannot see beyond crude oil
3416 2018-06-22 23:48:45 What is the secret Ingredient on making healthy Non Dairy Mac and Cheese to make it more delicious ? Olive Oil!!!

3417 2018-06-22 23:48:36 Excellent read.  Although not the first time these entities have conspired. GM, Standard Oil and Goodyear worked together to destroy EVs in the form of electric buses and streetcars once common in American cities in favor of diesel powered buses.
3418 2018-06-22 23:48:34 You’re going to want an oil company as main sponsor.
3419 2018-06-22 23:48:19 But any ways I need oil so I can fry these pork chops but I don’t wanna walk outside 
3420 2018-06-22 23:48:13 US wasn't *that* reliant on ME oil anyway - Canada is biggest source of US imports by far & US is biggest source of Canadian imports. There's a global market.
3421 2018-06-22 23:48:13 Coucou je l'utilise tous les soirs et en ce moment j'ai la peau très asséchée par ça, de larges plaques rouges et je pèle pas mal donc si tu peux trouver une autre crème c'est sans doute mieux ! Après tu peux essayer la tea tree oil, ou effaclar duo +  tiens nous au courant !
3422 2018-06-22 23:47:44 i’m boutta make dinner rolls from scratch and roasted garlic oil on the side b
3423 2018-06-22 23:47:36 Good just waiting for my oil change to be done and hoping they don't come back with 'you need new brakes and tires and headlight fluid and...'
3424 2018-06-22 23:47:33 Zucchini pizza. Cut zucchini in half use olive oil salt pepper onions and tomatoes  with mozzarella cheese on top bake or grill...its amazing
3425 2018-06-22 23:47:28 I think that Lava rock soap might do it, same shit they use for motor oil and whatnot. Either that or a pumice stone
3426 2018-06-22 23:47:07 I'm 90-10 that Chiarelli and the Oilers make the pick. Wishful thinking is that whoever ends up going 10th actually pans out. That list is not very good though.
3427 2018-06-22 23:47:07 GG’s glider always seems so smoky. Must be burning oil. You’d think with that level of advanced tech, Oscorp could cut down on the emissions.
3428 2018-06-22 23:46:52 I have a sunburn and due to many recommendations I put some coconut oil all over myself and now I feel like a rotisserie chicken
3429 2018-06-22 23:46:40 I desperately need a good massage... I mean hands on my body, warm oil....
I'd pay!!!
3430 2018-06-22 23:46:39 AS it turns out, thanks to Trumps compliance of collusion with Russia, Trump now owns 19.5% Russian Rosneft Oil Co. He opened the Arctic so Russia Oil could drill there, and Trump will finally become the billionaire he always claimed to be.
3431 2018-06-22 23:46:35 Were on 40ac of vineyard. STP= Stone Temple Pilots. Also a motor oil. LoL
3432 2018-06-22 23:46:35 nothin I like to do more on a friday than get an oil change
3433 2018-06-22 23:45:35 :do u have a caster oil? *shows a pic
:go #7 lower shelf on ur right

and it shows a section full of condoms. girl u kiddin?
3434 2018-06-22 23:45:33 Ann you and @crazybatmanfan would hear about me on the news. I'd be saying "I went in YouTube and was following along with making oil for dummies and boom. There it goes!" Haha. That'd be so fucked up!
3435 2018-06-22 23:45:24 the funny thing is that tar and oil are incredibly expensive and add hugely to roading costs. In India, they've worked out that used plastic is a great tar substitute and use it for roads. Their roads last 4-10 longer too. Two birds one stone
3436 2018-06-22 23:45:20 Less regulations for oil companies. More business opportunities/profits (helps economy) but damages environment
3437 2018-06-22 23:45:08 And we would probably take their oil.
3438 2018-06-22 23:44:43 えんじ良い
3439 2018-06-22 23:44:24 おはようございます。ご返信ありがとうございます。こちらの内容で是非お譲り頂ければと思います。よろしくお願い致します。
3440 2018-06-22 23:44:21 I hate getting my oil changed such a pain
3441 2018-06-22 23:44:03 Only if they had oil too.
3442 2018-06-22 23:43:58 from burning the midnight oil, at 5:00am. so true! so true!
3443 2018-06-22 23:43:50 If you actually believe it stop all Oil Sands production. If you don’t even consider please step down as environment minister as you clearly do not support the environment.
3444 2018-06-22 23:43:11 Wrong, you take their oil
3445 2018-06-22 23:42:53 Really? Huh. Guess I've never paid too close of attention, then. That said, the main reason I ever go to Woodmans is for oil changes and frozen pizzas, lol
3446 2018-06-22 23:42:52 PepsiCo has once again missed an opportunity to truly clean up its controversial palm oil supply chain. Despite five years of investigative reports and massive international consumer outcry, PepsiCo
3447 2018-06-22 23:42:35 It's not about production dotard! Change the rule so speculators must take delivery of the crude oil contracts!...thought u were savvy
3448 2018-06-22 23:42:33 I should have given her oil but then she would owe me $5 
3449 2018-06-22 23:42:27 Listen, oil is paid for! Talent is developed. We confuse developed talent too much with purchased oil. And they ain't oily just cause they make YOU feel some typa way!
Matthew 24:24
3450 2018-06-22 23:42:20 Never forget that one season (97-98) Berehowsky was with the Oil. Tough SOB who could chip in a little offensively.
3451 2018-06-22 23:42:10 If there's one thing Texans of all stripes agree on: we love high oil prices.
3452 2018-06-22 23:42:07 Because they’re oil now.
3453 2018-06-22 23:41:55 And then I have to my my regular taxes  and still pay my mortgage buy food for my family and car payment truck payment it is 750 for a simple oil change once a month should I go on about how much it coast me to deliver things for you to buy this is not making me rich at all
3454 2018-06-22 23:41:33 “Oil companies”? Unless they are integrated companies I think you mean “refiners”. Billybobs oil and gas in central Alberta is getting less than market value for their crude due to shipping constraints, handing that money to the same refiners on the Midwest and gulf coast.
3455 2018-06-22 23:41:07 Hi! Just a quick thought when near Nyc harbor watch all oil rigs waiting for right price to drop off there OIL. They’re just sitting and waiting for Wall Street to play with prices of a barrel of oil! President Bush was the Oil guy who started this mess. @realDonaldTrump

3458 2018-06-22 23:40:30 You are so full of shit. I moved to Alberta 4 years ago. And because of the oil downturn and the truly hateful NDP government I was left with no option but to move back to what I realize now is the socialist hell hole, Ontario. Thank the gods for Ford, some hope on the horizon.
3459 2018-06-22 23:40:28 チャーリーさん、どーしたんだろうな…
3460 2018-06-22 23:40:24 Trump approved the oil pipeline through native land. The protested, lost and boom there was a massive oil spill. Didn't hear Trump talk about the spill but he sure talked about the EO he signed opening up a new source of oil so $ can go in the pockets of his friends.

3463 2018-06-22 23:39:58 Been doing this for years and years! It's a wonderful and inexpensive way to enjoy popcorn, without popping it in oil.
3464 2018-06-22 23:39:58 After having maintenance in our apartment several times today and then going to a drive-thru oil change place, I’m realizing a lot about myself...

3466 2018-06-22 23:39:31 Niggas tried to tell me today that this Durag had castor oil infused in it
3467 2018-06-22 23:39:25 why are oil spills so often in rivers and streams and oceans and anywhere at all for that matter...
3468 2018-06-22 23:39:18 Oil industry shows3s #FoxBusiness
3469 2018-06-22 23:39:04 Perhaps uniting with a group promoting the use of Rick Simpson Oil derived from Cannabis to cure cancer. This would bring a different demographic perhaps to the fundraising table and such people often have a little extra money to donate to a good cause such as this one.
3470 2018-06-22 23:38:50 Afghanistan is All about the Oil and Gas Reserves!!!
3471 2018-06-22 23:38:46 Maz, di pasar tidak menjual oil Lips merek Clarins... Tempeleng aja yawla.
3472 2018-06-22 23:38:34 I put broccoli in the oven with spices and some olive oil and it’s rlly good same with bell peppers, red onions, carrots. Also baby carrots with hummus! And mashed avo with lemon, salt and pepper on toast is gr8
3473 2018-06-22 23:38:24 He has just taken away coastal protections from oil drilling, the GOP has pushed forward a plan to slash SS Medicare and Medicade the same amount as the tax breaks. Hell yeah VOTE THE GOP OUT.
3474 2018-06-22 23:38:23 Shows your poor understanding of the issues.  Why was oil market up +4%?
3475 2018-06-22 23:38:16 Can we please drink beers before, during, and after.  The two are so entertaining but the thought of Barbie bathed and humiliated in oil is such a thought, maybe the tow company will join us!
3476 2018-06-22 23:38:11 Been driving over ten years, and today for the first time I had two women my age working on my oil change. It was freaking great.
3477 2018-06-22 23:38:10 Keep a light weight oil on it after you’re done styling. I use to use argan or tea tree.
3478 2018-06-22 23:37:54 This move pissed me off, too many expected it so hence all shorts burned like an Iraqi oil well.
3479 2018-06-22 23:37:50 BEAUTY TIP FOR SUPER SOFT SKIN: make your own coffee scrub with finely ground coffee beans & coconut oil... you will thank me later
3480 2018-06-22 23:37:47 An oil back massage would be stupendous
3481 2018-06-22 23:37:46 B.S.  you take huge amounts of money from the oil industry and their lobbyists both foreign and domestic.
3482 2018-06-22 23:37:41 ;o; TY!!  man i really had to find out the hard way that everyones skin is so different lmAO wasted lots of moneys. I can say FOR SURE THO every day use of sunscreen, vitamin e oil, and rosehip oil is great for almost everyone.
3483 2018-06-22 23:37:38 It is body, face, and hair dry oil- it smells divine
3484 2018-06-22 23:37:30 UK and France are talking, UK brings up its new oil rigs and France says "BRO DO NOT SAY THAT, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?" seconds later United States joins the chat and says "Did I hear oil?"
3485 2018-06-22 23:37:28 Turmeric will help with the disc hernia pain,  shoulder injury, and the open face wound when mixed with garlic & olive/coconut oil... also Arnica Montana, applied topically...
3486 2018-06-22 23:37:17 Outside the Top 5 it really is a crapshoot but as we know, in this day and age, it's so difficult to move off one of these picks unless you are getting something special in return.
3487 2018-06-22 23:37:15 Doesn't look good when you really delve into it does it eh?
3488 2018-06-22 23:36:55 That's about 855.41 US Oil Barrels.

3493 2018-06-22 23:35:50 The oil and gas revenue is from the west so it doesn't matter - all that matters in this broken #liberal shitshow country Canada is pandering for Quebec & Ontario votes- that's how it works with our quasi socialist dictatorship democracy lite government
3494 2018-06-22 23:35:45 Popping it in oil and not air popping-is the secret. Adding salt and butter makes it even better or other flavoring if one prefers.
3495 2018-06-22 23:35:38 OPEC has always in my life manipulated oil prices and it moves up and down based on supply and demand. If you didn't have your head so far up you but, you would know that your father's Tweet had nothing to do with it. Gas always goes up in tourist season.
3496 2018-06-22 23:35:18 I know I've reached some strange, pathetic level of adulting because I was genuinely excited that I bought nice olive oil to put on my salads
3497 2018-06-22 23:35:00 No coincidence Russia owns much of Venezuela's debt collateralized by oil infrastructure. Putin wants this oil to stay in the ground. Same reason Russia funds all the anti-fracking "environmental" movement in Europe.
3498 2018-06-22 23:34:53 This from a guy who worked out the physics of landing oil tankers on the moon.
3499 2018-06-22 23:34:33 Use @SheaMoisture products, boo! They’ve saved my hair and skin. They make a really good hair mask too. I know you can get a decent coconut oil hair mask at Target for a buck, too.
3500 2018-06-22 23:34:07 Bourdon removed for obvious reasons, there's a ton of busts in that group. Brodin has been the best by default.

3502 2018-06-22 23:33:56 Erdogan backed by Putin would be a huge threat. They'd try to take the Cyprus oil. America would fight a small war to stop them. The UK has a massive military base there so would be right at the centre of it all. France + Germany would let Erdogan have it.
3503 2018-06-22 23:33:52 Don't see it but the potential is certainly there
3504 2018-06-22 23:33:42 Bills paid, business taken care of, full tank of gas, oil change, and a car wash. #EVERYTHINGISLOVE
3505 2018-06-22 23:33:32 Get rid of your phone and laptop....all made from oil and mining rare earth minerals
3506 2018-06-22 23:33:29 All the Libtrash rusted ons moaning about high petrol prices when their govt of inglorious bastards pats the oil co’s on the back for exporting all of our oil and importing it back from Singapore as petrol..all to avoid tax..
3507 2018-06-22 23:33:07 OPEC / Saudi Arabia should NOT increase production to support Trump political position with false low pricing. Trump only hurts/insults Arabic people worldwide.  Trump's done nothing. No political concession from Trump. Oil must reach its market price. Set up Multi Nation Trust
3508 2018-06-22 23:33:06 Yet another quality group 
3509 2018-06-22 23:33:00 Have you tried lavender oil? Has heaps of benefits to it 
3510 2018-06-22 23:32:42 VERY MUCH ALMOST DIED. We don’t know if there was oil or water or what but we definitely turned 90 degrees right from forward. But completely fine! Didn’t even touch the guard rail. Michael is a fucking CHAMP DRIVER #ohana18
3511 2018-06-22 23:32:36 Maybe because the price of oil dropped?
3512 2018-06-22 23:32:33 This guy just got a bath! He was covered in fleas and either oil or ink. We are thinking possibly ink as his fur is a dyed blue color. And the water resembled that of watered down paint.
3513 2018-06-22 23:32:29 Rather baffling isn't it...
3514 2018-06-22 23:32:14 I’m so used to eat so little though... fortunately I don’t get headaches because coffee keeps that from happening ... pasta is so good ! With a good tomato sauce w basil and oregano, garlic and olive oil ! So good !

3516 2018-06-22 23:31:31 $110 for an oil change?!  I need to learn about cars cause I can’t be doing this every 6,000 miles
3517 2018-06-22 23:31:29 Ironically the chemicals they used to clean up the spill, we're just as, or more dangerous than the oil itself.

3520 2018-06-22 23:31:20 @kenthehr makes a fair point, except that it's not the exact same government and regulations affecting Alberta's fiscal capacity that appear to be targeted. eg. Oil tanker ban off NW B.C. coast vs no ban St. Lawrence seaway, Saguenay vs Energy East downstream emmissions test.
3521 2018-06-22 23:31:04 Having a defuser with eucalyptus oil 
3522 2018-06-22 23:30:39 They are stock piling the oil while over charging for it.  Probably to drive up prices and make Trump look bad.  That or they are just being greedy.
3523 2018-06-22 23:30:35 Quite the group isn't it 
3524 2018-06-22 23:30:28 I accidentally bought fish oil with mint in it a second time from @target. It makes me nauseous. Maybe the third time I’ll get it right. Lol
3525 2018-06-22 23:30:14 Mini Brandy Norwood was trapped in a  book but was saved by a apparel patternmaker wearing Chervil covered in Chili oil who was sadly eaten by a drunk ewe who had a second upper arm made of praseodymium
3526 2018-06-22 23:30:12 If you really want to know use a frying pan. No oil or anything. High heat at first then turn it down to medium. Make a foil cover. The crust will be crisp and hot.

3529 2018-06-22 23:30:04 asking for a friend, how much does it rise with the next oil spill?
3530 2018-06-22 23:29:46 Um, don't you get most of your oil from Canada?
3531 2018-06-22 23:29:15 The oil only flows when it’s poured

I mean, I'm not telling anyone to not have opinions, to be clear. It's just that if he's part of the long term plan we should hope he does well

3542 2018-06-22 23:25:39 in case you don't socialize in macro-geologically-aware circles, the theory of "peak oil" is the notion that before massaging a breast one should first apply lubricant to the nipple buds
3543 2018-06-22 23:25:36 Use soap or palm oil...
3544 2018-06-22 23:25:28 Yeah i used my online resources i have it down to a science. Prefer Coconut Oil.

3553 2018-06-22 23:23:45 The "fun" part of it all is that OPEC blame You for the high oil price.....

3569 2018-06-22 23:20:54 How long does an oil change and balance rotation take? 
3570 2018-06-22 23:20:40 Once you experience the joy of lard nothing else satisfies. More MCT than coconut oil and lots yummier. Kills hunger.
3571 2018-06-22 23:20:38 Who controls the price of oil? Not OPEC. With revenues of $152 billion in 2016, VITOL GROUP is the largest independent ENERGY TRADER.-wiki [Not surprisingly, VITOL GROUP also,....... extracts crude oil, refines it into petroleum products.-Bloomberg.] That's not supply and demand.
3572 2018-06-22 23:20:25 my parents running away from oil splatters while deep frying fish together is marriage goals.

3576 2018-06-22 23:20:06 Yeah see what happens in those oil fields, then you wonder why BC is opposed to more pipelines.  We already had a spill this year by Kinder Morgan.
3577 2018-06-22 23:20:04 It isn't hard at all but he's right about the rarity. My cousin purchased a Tiida and I stopped her one day and asked her why the car sound like it choking on a salt bread. Long story short she had bout 10 drops of engine oil left and a sprinkle of coolant.
3578 2018-06-22 23:20:01 LRT; Is this... the next thing I should try out? I want to try more traditional media so I might as well try oil painting, right?

3580 2018-06-22 23:19:52 I've been meaning to try that oil because I have quite a few dark spots on my forehead. I've tried bio oil on it, but my acne/sensitive/almost forti...ish skin didn't like it. At this point I can't remember the last time my face was free of breakouts.
3581 2018-06-22 23:19:48 Getting an oil change and dude next to me is on his phone and forgets his volume is high, so the 4 of us in the room hear some chick moaning and saying to shove them both back in her  I was the only one laughing though.....

3584 2018-06-22 23:19:16 Haha- but crude surging today. Wonder if it's a headfake. When I was trading China in 2015 it was inverse to oil prices- especially to the downside.
3585 2018-06-22 23:19:07 Whatever, you'd rather believe immigrants are dangerous, the rich should pay less taxes, everyone on their own with health care, if you can't afford an education tough cookies. Drill oil and frack in our parks, poison water with no regulation and more, go have fun.
3586 2018-06-22 23:19:03 Why do you ppl keep putting words in my mouth. Can you read simple sentences. I never said we stole oil from Iraq. RW lady I was talking to said that is why we went to Iraq.
3587 2018-06-22 23:18:48 Also the spilled oil...how far do you want it to stay back?
3588 2018-06-22 23:18:27 Not having had a great education in art, this is the first I've heard of oil on panel...so this is what I've been missing all these years!
3589 2018-06-22 23:18:26 Ja op je voorhoofd is meestal van de stress.. genoeg slapen, en heb al veel goede dingen gehoord over tea tree oil, das goed tegen puistjes en voor minder stress  (kan je kopen in de kruidvat) x
3590 2018-06-22 23:18:13 Did anyone see in New Orleans, ppl begging the EPA to help them bcus an oil pipe ran threw the waters damaging their crawfish business .. annnnnnd guess who they voted for?????  Yep u guessed it.. Trump .. I laughed out loud of them pleading for the EPA n Trump to help them..smh!
3591 2018-06-22 23:18:11 Something happened last time and all the liberal demodopes were saying thanks obama.....
Obama didn't do sh** to lower gas prices....
OPEC just wanted to put other oil companies out of business....
3592 2018-06-22 23:18:04 I can’t even be snarky about VidCon today. 

Too tired, too disappointed in who gets to be called a data & strategy leader in this space.

3593 2018-06-22 23:17:58 How about a side of fresh steamed spinach with olive oil and fresh garlic to accompany a nice medium rare New York Strip? 
3594 2018-06-22 23:17:12 I know full well they didn't get to take their oil. That is what the right wing lady said was the reason for the war! I am aware of what happened in Iraq. 11 billion still missing. GOP won't do oversight even though that is their job
3595 2018-06-22 23:17:03 Dave I'm scared of making oil. Scared of blowing shit up
It's cheaper I'm assuming to buy it unless you grow enough to make enough oil which is a lot of greens.
3596 2018-06-22 23:17:02 sooo I was gifted organic sugar but I dont eat sugar or really cook with it so I am mixing it with oil and rubbing it all over my body 
3597 2018-06-22 23:16:56 Why do you want to keep oil down when economies boom when it’s high???
3598 2018-06-22 23:16:56 It seems they will be completely shutdown from processing bitumen as they won't have power, which seems to mean there will be [alot] of oil drawn from Canadian storage.  At least for the next 350,000bpd x 38-days!

3606 2018-06-22 23:15:31 Also, it is pathetic how Albertans still cannot accept that oil is a commodity that fluctuates on world markets which can affect your economy. Major Economic mismanagement by the former conservative PCs caused issues as well. #abopoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #keepitintheground

3630 2018-06-22 23:13:06 You applaud Mick Mulvaney for taking away all protections for consumers. That's because you don't work for us. We also know you are against public education and labor unions. Who exactly do you represent? Not all of Oklahoma is as rich as the oil companies you advocate for.

Oh wait, that happened? Yea this is dumb.
3633 2018-06-22 23:12:43 I can repeat you have your explanation of oil moves and Paul Tudor has his own explanation, the difference is that he has 4,7 billion to move oil in that direction where he see logic and price will ignore yours. Therefore trade what you see and not what you think.

3685 2018-06-22 23:06:43 Stand with the Gwich'in and tell @BLMNational to keep oil rigs out of the #ArcticRefuge
3686 2018-06-22 23:06:25 Here's a thought... instead of spending US$billions building a wall to keep people out... why not help Mexico get rid of the drug cartels, help it grow in prosperity and make it a country people want to stay in? The US is very quick to do this for countries with oil reserves...
3687 2018-06-22 23:06:00 This business of using religion to justify sadism and greed is disgusting & unacceptable. Ppl need to learn to think for themselves. A little skepticism is healthy— it keeps the  oil salesmen at bay.
3688 2018-06-22 23:05:48 That guy was bought out by big oil.
That guy was a fake.
That guy is complicit in the demise of our planet.
3689 2018-06-22 23:05:48 Lmao over pay good deal. AMD we think it should be easy to make a deal that is good for the oil and you 2 can’t even agree now that funny
3690 2018-06-22 23:05:38 he made me drink that castor oil, I took it twice but nothing happened.
3691 2018-06-22 23:05:21 Y’all expect women to be able to cook and do all the things you believe a woman should do. But hell yall cant do a oil change, change my brakes or nothing. Lol 
3692 2018-06-22 23:05:21 dkaldjchsk i put too much mct oil in my coffee last week and had to leave early #turdtwins
3693 2018-06-22 23:05:15 Your wish is OPECs command.  BREAKING: OPEC countries give in to President Trump's demands, agree to increase oil production by almost 1 million barrels a day - AP
#Winning
3694 2018-06-22 23:05:11 OMG...seriously? How about healthcare, increased wages, equal opportunity, student loan relief, free community college tuition, increased funding for trade schools, protection of the environment, increased renewable energy, decreased coal and oil production, etcetera...
3695 2018-06-22 23:05:10 Biore cleansing oil bagus tapi ada mineral oilnya bisa bikin break out cuman di aku gak pernah bikin break out sih wkwkwkwkw atau olive oil juga bisa, hadalabo juga bagus tapi susah nyari nya
3696 2018-06-22 23:05:05 じゃあ4人ね
シネパおるわ
3697 2018-06-22 23:05:03 Between your renewable, inexhaustible Snake Oil and Don Jr.'s hair, who needs OPEC?
3698 2018-06-22 23:05:02 Here's a thought... instead of spending US$billions building a wall to   keep people out... why not help Mexico get rid of the drug cartels, help it grow in prosperity and make it a country people want to stay in? The US is very quick to do this for countries with oil reserves...
3699 2018-06-22 23:04:55 Some part of Trump’s base is irredeemably racist. Other parts are hard-working, decent people who fell for a snake oil salesman’s lies. Those people will need our help. #RememberinNovember
3700 2018-06-22 23:04:48 I’ve bought Emu Oil to rub on my feet . Don’t judge me .
3701 2018-06-22 23:04:08 kalo oily pake dove oil control ajaa, kalo jerawat pane acnes
3702 2018-06-22 23:03:59  I’ll just leave those 3 here bcuz I think it’s a pretty good interpretation of my summer loves! Plus,I was matched w/ OUAI Sun of a Beach...what a yummy cocktail of lemon-infused coconut oil w/pineapple juice for ur hair...who doesn’t love a natural sun induced highlight?!
3703 2018-06-22 23:03:57 おじさんも行く
3704 2018-06-22 23:03:50 Ya nose look like u got hit wit a dab of oil lol
3705 2018-06-22 23:03:47 We could have, and perhaps should have, taken some of the oil for our investment in that war.
3706 2018-06-22 23:03:39 I'm not one of the "not my president people" of of course he is, he's THE president. But he's also a fucking subhuman level of stupid and lacks the cognitive ability to understand that maybe spilling millions of gallons of toxic oil into the ocean isn't a good idea.
3707 2018-06-22 23:03:09 Actually organic coconut oil is really good for your skin, I use it every night since I was 13 and I get compliments on my skin a lot. It’s coconut oil that’s not pure and has all the other added stuff that is bad for your face
3708 2018-06-22 23:02:58 Your club is shite, awful fans, can’t sell out a stadium, only successful because of oil. Also only relevant since 2010. Never won a European trophy? The list could go on.
3709 2018-06-22 23:02:46 I know. So awful.
Here’s what I know first hand about Roma living in Italy:
You wouldn’t have the wine, the olive oil, clean sheets, produce, etc etc without these hard workers. The current political situation in Italy is thanks in part to the awful Steve Bannon. He’s a plague.
3710 2018-06-22 23:02:29 I want to try the gummies and the bath bombs, because those are two of my favorite things! I am loving the CBD oil but need a stronger strength. Love HempBombs!! @KimCorser Go vote Sissy!
3711 2018-06-22 23:02:20 Freedom from what? We’ve always had freedom. Ex: There was no reason for the war in Iraq other than that they have massive amounts of oil. I respect the military for what they think and they’re told they’re trying to do, but in reality they’re just fighting for oil.
3712 2018-06-22 23:02:14 Oil.
3713 2018-06-22 23:02:13 spent £20 on pineapple tanning oil and it smells fucking rank
3714 2018-06-22 23:02:11 Here's a thought... instead of spending US$billions building a wall to  keep people out... why not help Mexico get rid of the drug cartels, help it grow in prosperity and make it a country people want to stay in? The US is very quick to do this for countries with oil reserves...
3715 2018-06-22 23:02:08  well played sir
3716 2018-06-22 23:01:49 @USNavy He’s attacking our closest allies & seems determined to destroy EU & NATO. Jared just met w Saudi Prince. Bolton going Moscow. Trump making deals w Putin? Oil deals? Something dirty is happening?
3717 2018-06-22 23:01:46 Joe, my brother was your biggest fan but he overdosed with a lethal injection of the cannabis oil. a response would mean the world to his decaying body.
3718 2018-06-22 23:01:45 Here's a thought... instead of spending US$billions building a wall to keep people out... why not help Mexico get rid of the drug cartels, help it grow in prosperity and make it a country people want to stay in? The US is very quick to do this for countries with oil reserves...
3719 2018-06-22 23:01:40 Coming back from the beach to reality is real struggle. The no makeup, salt water curls, tanning oil, T-shirt life is pretty great not gonna lie. Been back for 3 hours and I miss it already...
3720 2018-06-22 23:01:25 Everybody keep telling me different stuff about this castor oilI just want my baby out but Im not trying to force/rush him...
3721 2018-06-22 23:01:16 Booked tickets for entire family. I guess saving nonavian dinosaurs is a bit more intense than birds after an oil spill. Opps........
3722 2018-06-22 23:01:08 Have a body oil I made back in August still sitting to try on and test the length of the shelf life
3723 2018-06-22 23:01:04 And while the US oil market is booming, nobody wants to invest in our Bakkan oil fiends, which by the way, are not Oil Sands, and are identical to the North Dakota Bakkan fields. The only difference is our taxation and our regulations. So the economic argument is false.
3724 2018-06-22 23:01:01 In process... Exploration of space and mark. From my more intimate and microcosm landscape series.

3727 2018-06-22 23:00:35 I hope I never have to wear an injury thong.
3728 2018-06-22 23:00:12 Portobello cap brushed with olive oil, filled with very small chopped mushroom, onion, green/red peps & spices & pinch of fresh parm cheese - cook on grill or broil
3729 2018-06-22 23:00:10 I’m putting my name on my ie cause I’ll be damned if one of these Aikaes run off with it and ki’o its BYOO (bring your own oil) 
3730 2018-06-22 23:00:10 Here's a thought... instead of spending US$billions building a wall to keep people out... why not help Mexico get rid of the drug cartels, help it grow in prosperity and make it a country people want to stay in? The US is very quick to do this for countries with oil  reserves...
3731 2018-06-22 23:00:05 The snake oil comparison doesnt apply when your services are FREE, genius.

The beautiful thing about unmanipulated capitalism is that businesses survive based on merit. If my businesses arent delivering, ppl wont use them & my sponsors wont pay me anymore. So I kinda have to. 
3732 2018-06-22 23:00:01 You should make a Lucas Oil Pro Motocross game in the future
3733 2018-06-22 23:00:01 Hi. You’re club is successful because of oil and your fans are shite. Also, this tweet is about Mo Salah not about Liverpool Football Club. Cheers
3734 2018-06-22 22:59:55 Build position take profit part or all, build position take profit and do not search any other explanations as Paul Tudor Jones said once that he can move oil in necessary direction from 2 days to 1 week and always push it on other people stop losses to take profit part or all.
3735 2018-06-22 22:59:51 InfoChip's tags are chemically etched & designed to withstand harsh conditions found in mines, on #oil rigs, & other industrial areas.
3736 2018-06-22 22:59:46 I will vote against this GOP. I’m a registered Republican but after the privatization of military to invade Iraq for oil sickens me. The Republicans slaughter thousands of good American soldiers In Stole  6 trillion dollars from our national reserve And put it in their pockets
3737 2018-06-22 22:59:42 Try to get the smart dust nanotech off you, when u get home G-stalking is revving it up then satelites and drones hit us with our house electric. Power down, detox, take shoes off & spray w/peppermint oil+detergent+water.
3738 2018-06-22 22:59:42 Krug is a good player but I'd rather Oscar but as you mentioned, the injury thong w/ Klefbom is becoming worrisome. It always seems to be something
3739 2018-06-22 22:59:16 There was a fear of the 9000 barrels leaking into the creek there and my first thought was "at least it's not oil"
3740 2018-06-22 22:59:14 I just made my own little body oil shimmer thing omg it’s so pretty I just wanna shine a light on it
3741 2018-06-22 22:59:04 That Vanilla MCT Oil is 
3742 2018-06-22 22:59:01 Trump is the best President this country has had. Obama was a racist hater. Clintons? Name says it all. Bush? Oil man. Ronnie "American made" hahaha. I want save the English language. Keep illegal out.
3743 2018-06-22 22:58:10 Why the interest in Moldova? Dp they have oil, or what is it?
3744 2018-06-22 22:57:59 Donnie home boy, don’t b such a tool. Do you know what a oil seperate is ? I’ll guess not, well this immigrant knows more about cars , then you know about being  239 lbs w big hands . Late Donnie
3745 2018-06-22 22:57:52 Potable water is the new Oil
3746 2018-06-22 22:57:45 Eyo Ghost, I’m looking to cop on farmacy. I get the health benefits, but how do I take the black seed oil? Do I use it w/ food or do I put it in a drink? @therealstylesp
3747 2018-06-22 22:57:40 Olive oil WAY better than butter on popcorn ...
3748 2018-06-22 22:57:13 Excited to watch Oil City native @drcyphert of the @BataviaMuckdogs at @SCSpikes on Sunday night
3749 2018-06-22 22:57:08 Lets look at klefbom, he has a good contract but plays only 56% of the time  that is not good nu.bers for oil. Time to move on
3750 2018-06-22 22:56:48 Trump wants into the oil business so BAD!!!
3751 2018-06-22 22:56:37 Maybe they think I'm gonna bribe my way to an easy pool because of Oil money
3752 2018-06-22 22:56:31 That CAD/oil correlation ain't what it used to be though
3753 2018-06-22 22:56:31 @qvcuk should all @Elemis products be on easy pay for their 23rd birthday? Quite a few are not including the pro collagen marine oil
3754 2018-06-22 22:56:26 OIL RICH PEOPLE ?! I CANT 
3755 2018-06-22 22:56:10 mbn! I coped the oil head hat & the India boy button up 
3756 2018-06-22 22:56:08 บั้มละเท่าไหร่หรอคะ
3757 2018-06-22 22:56:08 how my day at the zoo went:
•a deer decided to rip my ponytail out 
•randomly fell backwards walking
•spilled fish oil all over myself 
•got 3 mosquito bites & 5 bruises
3758 2018-06-22 22:55:45 Todos mis indicadores me dan compra $apbr y $pbr....Oil volando.....No se ya que pensar
3759 2018-06-22 22:55:36 This might sound weird, but take a bath with some olive oil in it!!
3760 2018-06-22 22:55:28 wishing there was an essential oil that could take this online class for me
3761 2018-06-22 22:55:24 Don’t forget: Trump’s threats toward Iran, his “kinship” with Turkey’s Erdogan, and his indifference toward Syria, Yemen, & Ukraine has helped push oil prices higher globally- all of which helps Putin politically & monetarily as oil & natural gas are Russia’s biggest exports...
3762 2018-06-22 22:55:18 Those other countries establish reserves from their oil revenue when things are good, establish investments in other industries, and that carries them through the rough spots. Canada just taxes all of that away and then hands it over to Quebec and the east coast.
3763 2018-06-22 22:55:17 Now he has the backing of not only Putin, but dictators, & oil oligarchs, a compromised & complicit Congress. He's 24/7 in our minds, on TV, in print. Feed a narcissist  and they only get worse and worse. As Mueller closes in, he will implode and do something even more awful.
3764 2018-06-22 22:55:16 How does this even make any sense? Do you remember when BP was shooting oil in the Gulf for months after that accident?
3765 2018-06-22 22:55:11 I WONDER WHAT BEING BOILED IN OIL FEELS LIKE
3766 2018-06-22 22:55:01 Considering we were not propped up by oil ever but an investment company who now turn a profit as a whole out of us it would be very nice to find an alternative fo oil amd stop the energy crisis
3767 2018-06-22 22:54:59 She went down south the other day and was gonna change the oil right before leaving and hadn't gotten around to calling the dealer so she went to do it
3768 2018-06-22 22:54:58 It was just take profit of short positions made before OPEC, on Monday you will see take profit of long positions made on Friday. Oil has this logic only, that is why many times it falls on completely bullish EIA reports. It is driven by guys like Tudor and they trade like that.
3769 2018-06-22 22:54:40 use lots of vitamin E oil on your stomach and thighs! it’s works wonders with not getting stretch marks!
3770 2018-06-22 22:54:24 I'm not able to predict the future, so I have no argument directly to your point what concerns me is that this policy, allows him to out the EO 04/28/17, into full action. Mass development for the oil industries is his plan, and he plans to do it in some of the most ecologically
3771 2018-06-22 22:54:10 土曜は平日
3772 2018-06-22 22:53:58 His tweets literally made OPEC produce more oil and thus lowering gas prices. Stocks break records. Unemployment break records. North Korea will de nuke. Reverse policy from 2010 separating families at borders. ISIS stomped. For shame ... Shame I say!
3773 2018-06-22 22:53:53 Yes I agree. They are trying to get us less dependent on oil from S.A. But where else do we get our oil from? Dubai? Israel?
3774 2018-06-22 22:53:51 my wife bought a new Honda civic and she gets free oil change services from the dealer for a while so she's been doing that, but of course for dealer service you have to make an appointment way ahead of time
3775 2018-06-22 22:53:39 You think for one minute this Russian oil coup will be voted away?  Stop fooling yourself and others. It’s long past WAITING TIME.
3776 2018-06-22 22:53:27 Stand with the Gwich'in and tell @BLMNational to keep oil rigs out of the #ArcticRefuge for good.
3777 2018-06-22 22:53:24 "Hoping" oil prices drop is about as much actual work as you'll ever put into fixing the issue.
3778 2018-06-22 22:53:14 What is puljujarvi? Underachieving player that looks lost. If oil take a big step that pick should be 20-30 next year for a true #1 dman and pp q b with a big shot
3779 2018-06-22 22:53:12 Apparently yes tree oil is strong enough to melt my tsum tsums face
3780 2018-06-22 22:53:00 That’s not easy to find
The last I had broke all time anything and as she wanted to clean the oil paintings I was there was a luck I told her to go
3781 2018-06-22 22:52:59 Water. COCONUT OIL
3782 2018-06-22 22:52:51 Epilepsy, ppl have known for about 10yrs that cannabis oil stops seizures yet research facilities cannot research it because it is illegal which gives GW the edge over their competitors. If they reschedule cannabis to schedule 2 research would take a massive leap forward
3783 2018-06-22 22:52:24 Need help to oil your back
3784 2018-06-22 22:52:04  moment you hear some Marina Davis it’s “CHEEEEEHOOOO” *pulls out the baby oil and ones
3785 2018-06-22 22:51:49 The “It’s our oil” campaign was the spark that led to SParl and the huge support that endured today of devolution
3786 2018-06-22 22:51:49 Stand with the Gwich'in and tell @BLMNational to keep oil rigs out of the #ArcticRefuge
3787 2018-06-22 22:51:34 Fried chicken or oil pulling or both?
3788 2018-06-22 22:51:30 también lo dio todo oil o Di Maria que siempre se mató cuando jugó, pero salió fatal del club. Este quiere seguir sus pasos.
3789 2018-06-22 22:51:18 Nissan just called me telling me my Altima needs an oil change 
3790 2018-06-22 22:50:56 I have 5 $25 gift card available if anyone wants to order CBD oil or any other products !! PM me or comment below
3791 2018-06-22 22:50:41 Pacific - the 48 diameter trans-Alaska oil pipeline, conveying oil 800 miles from Prudhoe Bay to Val….
3792 2018-06-22 22:50:40 Baby oil?
3793 2018-06-22 22:50:33 & then w the knj twist, baby oil.
3794 2018-06-22 22:50:02 Today I took home a bag of pb cups...yeah I’m gonna try my best not to get unhealthy. Although our candies are only made with coconut oil, carob, and other organic items to finish the product. No chocolate involved at all.
3795 2018-06-22 22:50:00 Flooding is the big story in KELOLAND this week, but a small town in Iowa is dealing with double the trouble after a train carrying crude oil derailed near Doon, Iowa. KELOLAND News has the story at 6.
3796 2018-06-22 22:49:58 Oil gonna blow it somehow
3797 2018-06-22 22:49:54 Ur pulling out of the Iran deal is what's causing crude prices 2 rise. Gas up $2.00/gal since Jan 2017, well on it's way to $5.00/gal under Bush 43 regime & more. OPEC raised their prices because of U. ONLY U. Why not stop shopping OUR oil 2 other countries & refine it here 4 us?
3798 2018-06-22 22:49:51 Help to fill a container! Oil is what you need.  #gameinsight #ipad #ipadgames
3799 2018-06-22 22:49:49 If Russia spends enough in panic it will make them highly susceptible to a total Russian collapse if EU cut all sales of Russian oil / gas. Meaning 10% of their national GDP would vanish at snap of finger & inevitable mutiny as they cant pay their military.
3800 2018-06-22 22:49:39 It was made from coconut oil.
It wasn't as good as cow cheese.
3801 2018-06-22 22:49:33 hindistan cevizini türkiye kokonatseverler derneği kuracak kadar seviyo olmama rağmen coconut oil’in şişirilmiş bir balon olduğuna inanarak bugüne kadar hiç almamıştım. BOY. WAS I WRONG.
3802 2018-06-22 22:49:30 Ahhh yes. #medicinalpurpose CBD oil is different. Guessing the “smoking sections” will include “THC” users though.  Jus sayin.  #gotchips ?
3803 2018-06-22 22:49:23 Bob Ross is so chill he makes me feel like oil painting is like daydreaming
3804 2018-06-22 22:49:21 What will Louisiana do when another major oil spill happens?
3805 2018-06-22 22:49:16 No Fracking...lets just wait a bit then have to go to Mr Putin for our gas and oil, which is all well and good. Then Mr Putin triples the price like he did with the Ukraine about 2 years back !
3806 2018-06-22 22:49:15 While I have always liked Darnell & fully expect him to continue to improve, if the Oilers could get their hands on Parayko and it came down to giving up Nurse, the decision is a rather easy one.
3807 2018-06-22 22:49:14 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
3808 2018-06-22 22:49:14 Saudi? Is the US oil buddy, and you are helping them out creating a genocide!
3809 2018-06-22 22:49:10 Trump says companies can spill oil into our oceans?  He must be removed from office and the #GOP must be removed from the majority or they must do their job.

#VoteThemOut2018 #ImpeachTrump
3810 2018-06-22 22:49:01 Hey I’m in CA which is a mostly all Dem state. And yet we still have fracking. And now more offshore oil drilling. And now a new water project to help corporate farmers. My point is just b/c they are a Dem doesn’t mean the won’t screw you. so...hold all accountable.
3811 2018-06-22 22:49:00 Grilling this Friday night? Be sure to thank oil and natural gas for your propane grill!
3812 2018-06-22 22:48:46 Take the oil!

3816 2018-06-22 22:47:17 If it has a keloid (a bump) use tea tree oil. If it’s just infected use saline solution
3817 2018-06-22 22:47:11 It's clay. I used sth like one part Moroccan clay to two parts green clay (basically whatever I had) and a few drops of argan oil. And water.
3818 2018-06-22 22:46:59 Tyler and I made cannabis infused coconut oil w double the amount of weed the recipe called for and we’re making baked goods w it tonight!! I’m ready to die
3819 2018-06-22 22:46:45 Last tweet was a joke...

Im actually rolling like a saudi prince because of the crude oil pump today.
3820 2018-06-22 22:46:41 If yall ever quit smoking weed you should try CBD oil.
3821 2018-06-22 22:46:40 Face, hair, basically anything you put coconut oil on
3822 2018-06-22 22:46:09 blamish oil, buying snails in burgh de rott and sample bottles in canifis, feels good
3823 2018-06-22 22:46:09 So let’s make America great again.  Buy you oil from the Middle East. And screw your allies. Priceless.  President tard.
3824 2018-06-22 22:46:03 I was referring to coconut oil in the hair  ain’t nobody doing siva samoas
3825 2018-06-22 22:46:00 Finally got some CBD oil and now I can’t wait for bed time to see how it works for me
3826 2018-06-22 22:45:53 The dolphin slaughter in Taiji, Japan
 is a disgusting act by humans. Is something we need to put a stop to but all our government wants to control outside our borders are oil and Poppy fields it's truly disgusting what are leaders care about behind closed doors #replaceCongress
3827 2018-06-22 22:45:46 We could have another recession. That got oil prices nice and low under G. W. Bush.
3828 2018-06-22 22:45:41 savory chicken mac & cheese. . .17
whole-wheat pizza and crab rangoon. . .31
fish & chips of acorn squash and olive oil lettuce cups. . .5
portuguese spinach bao, dumplings. . .30
3829 2018-06-22 22:45:29 Check your Engine oil this morning.
3830 2018-06-22 22:45:21 That’s not fair. When they voted for it the gov’t supported investment in our energy sector. Now we have a government that has thwarted us in every way possible at the exact same time as when we were already hurting due to the oil price drop.
3831 2018-06-22 22:45:16 Turn in your keys then hypocrite and use zero oil products liar
3832 2018-06-22 22:45:06 I use CBD oil already but that’s all that’s legal here
3833 2018-06-22 22:45:04 $70 dollar oil in the age of fracking will do that to you #dressforsuccess
3834 2018-06-22 22:45:02 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
3835 2018-06-22 22:44:56 I shaved my legs with baby oil and my legs are so smooth that I’m low-key bitter I don’t have a boyfriend to appreciate it
3836 2018-06-22 22:44:54 @jiffylube....technicians didn’t replace a cap and now I have oil everywhere and my car is overheating! Not answering my call. So not happy about this. My car was running fine until I went to Jiffy Lube.
3837 2018-06-22 22:44:53 A friend of my parents taught me this nearly fifty years ago. Oil should be about 1/4 inch in the pot. Perfect popcorn.
3838 2018-06-22 22:44:46 The economy has improved since the 2015 oil crash. State revenues are up. Lawmakers and the Governor have only proposed replacing some of the temporary 1 cent sales tax expiring in July. This could be a 7 year fix. But it’s not the tax reform they had promised 3 years ago #lalege
3839 2018-06-22 22:44:41  i dont blame him. I wouldve done the same thing. Still juju though. Watch youll beat argentina 3-1 and youll sacrifice oil to the gods
3840 2018-06-22 22:44:36 Things are looking good on that score - I know someone in bad chronic pain who is looking forward to higher-strength CBD oil being allowed in UK.
3841 2018-06-22 22:44:23 I don't support oil at all. There are lots of alternatives.
3842 2018-06-22 22:44:05 Fewer freezing degree days? That does NOT sound like #globalcooling or a #miniiceage!!! Maybe the globe IS warming after all! 

Not that the gullible fools will get the message and the climate snake oil peddlers will keep making $ off them.
3843 2018-06-22 22:44:04 I pay 2.70...and as you know just like when Obama was in WH...Dealing with gas prices are a way of life no matter who is in WH.. This situation allows OPEC, which has spare production capacity, to control the total global oil supply and therefore oil pricing...OPEC needs to GO!
3844 2018-06-22 22:43:40 C.J. & Zak changed the oil in my Yoda and as I was pulling out of their shop Zak’s smart ass asked if I could pull out. I reminded him that he was the one with a kid- not me. 
And my mom and grandmother wonder why I can’t find a nice person to settle down with. This damn mouth 
3845 2018-06-22 22:43:38 Bio Oil is life changing.
3846 2018-06-22 22:43:12 I thought I genuinely remember him saying he wasn’t gonna be lenient with Oil Corps...
3847 2018-06-22 22:43:02 And how much direct & indirect investment in the Oil Sands was there from the Feds?  I'm assuming at least some, but I don't know.
3848 2018-06-22 22:42:55 it did for me ctfuu, just take like half a teaspoon and wash your face with it. it basically dries up your skin which worked for me since my acne was primarily cause of oil
3849 2018-06-22 22:42:31 There’s been suspensions in the past for just allegations, where the victim decided to drop all charges
3850 2018-06-22 22:42:23 They still could have created a Scottish sovereign oil fund. The SNP campaigned on it.
3851 2018-06-22 22:42:21 If Scotland had gone independent in the 1960’s and *somehow* managed to take the North Sea Oil territories with them, your point might be slightly valid?
3852 2018-06-22 22:42:21 Recent research has proved that  vegetable fats like corn , canola , vegetable oil , sunflower oil etc are all hazardous to health . Please use olive oil and ghee only .
3853 2018-06-22 22:42:02 Why would an oil company want to be the creator of a major oil spill again? Technological advances and preventative measures will not be used regardless of a policy.
3854 2018-06-22 22:41:32 I hope the Oil trade their 1st rounder for Mike Hoffman's fiancee tonight #herecometheoilers
3855 2018-06-22 22:41:31 CHINA have stop buying soybeans from America what is going2happen2the farmer all those farmer r going2lose their farm people in Louisiana cannot Fish the water is2poisoned the fisher r dying Oil and all kind filthy that the EPA is letting happen we all will b drinking dirty water
3856 2018-06-22 22:41:10 It is and it would be hard to change my mind otherwise.  I don’t think people realize how oil dependent we still are as a country.
3857 2018-06-22 22:41:02 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.
3858 2018-06-22 22:41:02 And that box slippery like tryna walk on oil 
3859 2018-06-22 22:40:59  I'm not a fan of their chicken.... I don't care for the oil it's cooked in
3860 2018-06-22 22:40:56 Sitting in the waiting room getting my oil changed @ walmart when a family w 3 kids comes in with their kids screaming and rolling on the floor fighting and crying while the parents do nothing. Why?????????? WHY
3861 2018-06-22 22:40:49 there's enough oil on him to deep fry an elephant
3862 2018-06-22 22:40:45 Finn does this with those baby oil videos 
3863 2018-06-22 22:40:36 made an amazing turmeric-banana mask & then made a rosehip oil coffee scrub just to indulge in making myself that much softer while I let it soak into my skin. I smell & feel amazing 
3864 2018-06-22 22:40:36 So Eataly had a promotion today where we got a free WHOLE BLACK TRUFFLE with purchase of a certain bottle of olive oil! Chefs/food lovers: other than the obvious (shave over pasta), any suggestions?
3865 2018-06-22 22:40:27 Hell na he can stay at home, i got the oil dough
3866 2018-06-22 22:40:27 仕事に疲れた時は甘い物がいいって言うよな！え…このプリン、ナルルちゃんのだったのか…(｀ω´;;)
3867 2018-06-22 22:40:24 Yall. I am almost 22 years old and today I went by myself to go get my oil changed. These guys must think I am the dumbest girl alive since I didn't know anything except that I need full synthetic oil lmao
3868 2018-06-22 22:40:11 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
3869 2018-06-22 22:40:00 Newsflash: "Lard + Soybean OIl + Sugar Combo is bad for your ass"

Wow - what an amazing research team, to (for the nth time) illustrate this.
3870 2018-06-22 22:39:58 Use moisturizer that has hyaluronic acid in it. It retains skin moisture & has anti-aging/ healing properties!! Super important ingredient for people with dry skin! I recommend using serum and a facial oil lol ( serum over oil if u have to choose) I use Dr. Roebuck’s moisturizer
3871 2018-06-22 22:39:47 SEANIK!!!! I USE THAT TO AND THATS MY FAVOURITE ONE!!! JASON AND THE ARGAN OIL (FUSCIA PINK) ALSO SMELLS BOMB AF TOO BUT ITS TOO OILY 4 MY HAIR AYYYY
3872 2018-06-22 22:39:41 Who are a few players Oil might target in round 2?
3873 2018-06-22 22:39:38 Ps.141:5 -- Reproof from another believer can be an "excellent oil" that brings healing.
3874 2018-06-22 22:39:28 I don't remember trying it--it was my dad's thing, and he had it rarely at home. I think it was something he ate more regularly onboard the oil tanker where he was radio operator. I should make a point of seeking it out, now that I think about it!
3875 2018-06-22 22:39:23 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with the oil in the name of the Lord: James 5:14
3876 2018-06-22 22:39:19 Coconut oil.  Or peas.  But really, coconut oil.
3877 2018-06-22 22:39:00 Plz for your own sake do not come at me today, my hair follicles have been infused with the powerful argan oil of Morocco
3878 2018-06-22 22:38:43 Going to the mechanics first thing only to find out my car needs oil. Hope it's not a leak
3879 2018-06-22 22:38:41 Rev 6:6 - & I heard a voice from the midst of the 4 living-ones, saying,
A choenix of wheat for a dinar; And 3 choenices of barley for a dinar; And the oil and the wine hurt not.
3880 2018-06-22 22:38:39 The Alberta Finace Minister took over when Alberta was suffering after oil prices plumeted. The Cons had a pre election budget that would have transferred 40 years of bad planning to their voters. Albertans weren’t happy. Alberta’s economy is strong now. No bitching
3881 2018-06-22 22:38:25 Me the other day with my tanning oil. I didn’t even mention it ANYWHERE or talk to anyone about it, but when I checked IG??? Hawaiian Tropic.
3882 2018-06-22 22:38:08 Look at how oil was managed by Norway...
3883 2018-06-22 22:38:06 About TOR, you know we can find oil over in the other regions which we've neglected all this while.. Looking forward to a reviving TOR.
3884 2018-06-22 22:38:01 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
3885 2018-06-22 22:37:42 BREAKING: OPEC countries give in to President Trump's demands, agree to increase oil production by almost 1 million barrels a day - AP
3886 2018-06-22 22:37:28 Do you mix your makeup remover all in one ? Like the coconut oil, with the tea tree and lavender or use it separately? SORRY IF THIS IS A DUMB QUESTION. I just use coconut oil to remove my makeup but your method sounds much nicer !
3887 2018-06-22 22:37:21 Well I suppose North of the Frozen North is "Oil Rigs and Polar Bears". 
But don't get me started on the relegation of Orkney and Shetland to a randomly placed box....
3888 2018-06-22 22:37:05 Also remember that the only state in the USA that buys  middle Eastern oil is California. They won't build a pipeline to Texas.
3889 2018-06-22 22:37:02 Sorry to hear you are suffering the vile restless leg Rich. I have to say I use cannabis oil and have done for 2 months now. I haven't had restless legs since using it. I swear by it. I still have bad body twitches but I can cope with those. Hope you get some respite and sleep
3890 2018-06-22 22:36:53 The chrome bezels are nicer in my humble opinion!  What are the small gauges for?  I would guess oil pressure and oil temperature, volts and amps for the other two.
3891 2018-06-22 22:36:07 Bro why did I see a brand new Audi R8 in Big Lake... for those of you that don’t know it ain’t shit out here in Big Lake but mfs that work in the oil field and that’s a $250,000 car 
3892 2018-06-22 22:36:05 Yes, but only because The United States of America has oil.
3893 2018-06-22 22:36:04 What name have you given to the families of the hundreds of children killed by white men in our public schools? Snake oil salesman. Disgraceful.
3894 2018-06-22 22:36:03 Just undoing everything Obama did... and being buddy-chummy with oil co’s. He has zero concern for the planet.
3895 2018-06-22 22:36:02 I messed around and put oil on my face before going outside , I literally COOKED!
3896 2018-06-22 22:35:49 Went to get an oil change today and they ended up giving me a free tire bc i had a nail in mine  God is good
3897 2018-06-22 22:35:36 I can smell the PATCHOULI OIL through the picture...

This [Clinton] supporting goblin needs to be locked up. 

I always thought our @FBI were the creme of the crop...look at this thing...REALLY @FBI? REALLY?

3898 2018-06-22 22:35:03 Remember that fracked oil is super light and clean. Everyone wants it. They will be standing in line.
3899 2018-06-22 22:34:29 I thought you had the domestic oil situation locked down Donnie?  Oh, guess not you master fucking negotiator.  Oh wait, you would have to negotiate your way to an idea, but that's a contradiction in terms.  You've never had an idea!
3900 2018-06-22 22:34:28 mon oïl
3901 2018-06-22 22:34:23 It's a process...step one is to stop any type of hygiene. Step two is to stop wearing anything fashionable or fitted. Step three involves large splashes of patchouli oil and a henai tattoo...step fifty-seven gender studies... LOL
3902 2018-06-22 22:33:56 I've cooked everything with chili oil lately and forgot I ran out of hot sauce 
3903 2018-06-22 22:33:33 Oil diffusers make a room smell amazing
3904 2018-06-22 22:33:25 Have you considered therapy for your negative attitude? Trade is balancing. Concessions left and right. A good relationship with Saudi’s will allow more oil... and congress passed a summer mix fuel law. Remember that?
3905 2018-06-22 22:33:21 I know you hillbots don’t care about the future you won’t see, but a lot of us do. There is no time to waste turning our environment around. She still loves big oil. She’s just as bad. We can/you can do better.
3906 2018-06-22 22:33:17 Tea tree oil, coconut oil, wild growth oil and regular washes are all you need!
3907 2018-06-22 22:33:08 @Take5_OilChange I gotta say, you guys kind of suck. Your website states "25% off for rideshare drivers" but has no prices anywhere, and the phone number just goes to a recording that never says the name of the business. So I drive there and the cheapest oil change is $37.99!
3908 2018-06-22 22:33:00 No. I wanna see $100 oil
3909 2018-06-22 22:32:36 a human mind is the most valuable natural resource a nation could ask for -> an oil reserve or block of silicon are nothing without ingenuity and labor. the problems we see have more to do with the welfare state and a failed drug war than “illegals”

3911 2018-06-22 22:32:01 @soles_feranmi 8k Pere for the oil and shampoo
3912 2018-06-22 22:31:56 They already are. Right out of Houston. Why do you think oil and gas prices are up in the US.
3913 2018-06-22 22:31:41 My Milchreis would taste better if I got a bottle of oil from you.

3917 2018-06-22 22:30:58 in the post you said “hydrate, exfoliate, hydrate again and moisturizer, how do we hydrate before exfoliating. Won’t the exfoliant (chem or phy) just rub off the hydrator? also if we use a oil cleanser can we use a water cleanser after?
3918 2018-06-22 22:30:55 @Jenna_Marbles @juliensolomita next podcast: segue-way off but the sponsors are products from snake oil (belt candy we are cops)
3919 2018-06-22 22:30:42 So today as I baked in 110 degree heat with No shade at the oil refinery in Louisiana a total of 7 buzzards came and circled above me for hours, I really thought it was about to be my time to go, but as you can tell not yet fuckers
3920 2018-06-22 22:30:22 there was a train wreck south of Sandpoint not too long ago, imagine a crude oil tanker in the lake...

3925 2018-06-22 22:29:51 No vegan means they use no animal products in it vegetarian means there’s no meat so yeah there’s no meat in tofu but most of the time how it’s processed it uses some sort of animal byproduct or the way it’s cooked the oil or seasonings used
3926 2018-06-22 22:29:40 ND has nukes, food production, and oil. If we're talking long-term war,  that's a good call
3927 2018-06-22 22:29:37 It’s been 4 years since I started taking sea buckthorn oil  #Omega
3928 2018-06-22 22:29:32 I think the oil is working. I feel less nervous and the pain in my knee is going away.
3929 2018-06-22 22:29:31 So I’d like to brag that I put air in my tires all by MYSELF. 
What’s next?
Change my own tires?
Change my own oil?
I’m unstoppable!!!!! 

(Joke, I’m struggling, help me.)
3930 2018-06-22 22:29:28 hi so i used to struggle with self harm, and i figured out a way to help them heal faster. add olive oil, and water in a cup. try to mix it as good as you can. once thats mixed, add table salt to the mixture, if you can add epsoms salts too that helps it also. apply it on the cut
3931 2018-06-22 22:29:25 It’s done on our tax money! How far will we tolerate this consolidation of autocratic power. Just look at what his cabinet are all making money on...oil and lifting sanctions and business with putin and China. He is compromised!
3932 2018-06-22 22:29:23 Hope there’s no oil spills on his golf courses. 
3933 2018-06-22 22:29:17 And the other one third is completely against the oil freeway Trudeau is trying to push thru
3934 2018-06-22 22:29:01 So no for-profit entity should be involved in providing transportation? Or is it okay somehow for there to be profitmaking car, oil, train, steel and concrete companies?

3944 2018-06-22 22:27:25 I saw the wife throwing some olive oil into a pan. The olive oil bottle is the exact same shape and size as the bottle of Bushmills single malt. Medical fact/note to practitioners of melodrama: it is entirely possible for a man to scream and faint at the same time.

3949 2018-06-22 22:26:34 It was really warming up the earth by staying in the ground. Glad we have those altruistic oil companies looking out for us.
3950 2018-06-22 22:25:58 Too complex - erm and again No. they have a battery, motor and 4 wheels. No engine,fan belt, ignition,radiator, exhaust system,piston, engine oil, rarely use true break pads (regenerates motor instead) - they are more modern, but less complex machines.
3951 2018-06-22 22:25:40 Nice now approve hemp oil to be gown and sold at decent price and prescription drugs will be a thing of the past.
3952 2018-06-22 22:25:31 yay my truck got a oil change :)

3960 2018-06-22 22:24:28 Are you gonna do that on every confession? lol
3961 2018-06-22 22:24:22 US crude oil is light. crude from the OPEC, Venezuela & Canada is heavy.  Most domestic refineries are set up for heavy crude so increasingly our own production doesn’t lower our prices. 
PS he sounds like a toddler begging for candy
3962 2018-06-22 22:24:21 Forget OPEC. Produce more US oil.
3963 2018-06-22 22:24:10 oil paints blend so well!
3964 2018-06-22 22:23:55 I really like the idea of pure oils, but my skin seems to hate them. It's basically my sure-fire method of waking up with a breakout. Although argon oil is one of the few I haven't tried. I'm glad it works for you! x
3965 2018-06-22 22:23:46 Oil changes make a car feel so much lighter
3966 2018-06-22 22:23:39 I always stuff mine with a mixture of garlic, seasoned breadcrumbs, & olive oil.
3967 2018-06-22 22:23:34 reeks of opportunistic bologna... @realDonaldTrump is a transparent grifter. His snake oil isn't working Trump!
3968 2018-06-22 22:23:29 21. Don’t  shampoo wash your hair in the bath ladies it causes #bacterial #vaginosis, you wouldn’t wash your eyes with shampoos  would you? Forget #femfresh, #wipes after the toilet use toilet paper! Avoid #detol #cocanut oil soaked in tampoons etc...#natural #vaginal #health 
3969 2018-06-22 22:23:25 As @SlacktivistFred once said, there success selling snake oil has less to do with their skills as snake oil salesmen and everything to do with finding an audience so eager to buy snake oil.
3970 2018-06-22 22:23:18 Oil boom?  Is there one rig operating off the coast of LA right now?  Have the oilfield jobs come back yet?  What are you talking about?
3971 2018-06-22 22:22:52 Oil stocks are low, gold and copper arr low too; i think the comodities supercycle can push this market in a new bull market

3977 2018-06-22 22:21:31 I have very sensitive skin and I have had luck with Clinique products. Right now I use pure argon oil on my face every few days and infant sunscreen
3978 2018-06-22 22:21:28 Well looks like the Oil are going to pick at 10. Who’s name do you want to hear, Oilers fans?
3979 2018-06-22 22:21:28 But he said I'd have all new oil, too... so totally worth it, right?
3980 2018-06-22 22:21:13 Forbes shilling for big oil. #suprising . You are still dodging the facts.
3981 2018-06-22 22:21:12 Only if there was oil.
3982 2018-06-22 22:20:59 And you don’t care whether the world burns?  How much money do you get from the oil industry.

3985 2018-06-22 22:20:46 Congratulations! Those oil commercials are really putting you in the public eye
3986 2018-06-22 22:20:40 The richness of it Reminds me of an oil painting you would see hanging over a mantle in a gold frame

1. Summit your own insights. No copycats! 
2. Attach legible #WTI charts. 
3. No comments if there are no merits or no charts.
3993 2018-06-22 22:19:35 How fiscally responsible should we assume a leader who can't even do basic math is going to be? Seems Like old Andy is nothing more than a snake oil selling "Con" man.
3994 2018-06-22 22:19:34 I was thinking how much the Brits & the EU community have put the Israelis & the Arabs on the same moral plane when they knew from the beginning the Arabs could only bring primitive tribal squabblng, intolerance & depraved violence to the table. They were such oil whores.
3995 2018-06-22 22:19:30 From the drone video...y'all should get a boom on the ONE culvert downstream from the oil spill. Why are you waiting?????? Someone could have just rolled some big bails of hay as an interim response. Lord. Oil spill 101!!!!!!

4001 2018-06-22 22:18:48 Cool... I definitely did not agree with a lot that went on while in office but Bush 1&2 had Cheney who made 43 billion off govt contracts.Billions more with Saudis (oil) which is why we went there in the 1st place. How many lives behind this
4002 2018-06-22 22:18:38 You can have a dream about riding a horse, or you can have a dream about drowning in oil!

4006 2018-06-22 22:18:10 DEMOCRATIC LIBERALS believe the most azzbackwards unnatural BS known to human beings.

They are the type that think you are suppose to put oil in your gas tank.
4007 2018-06-22 22:18:09 Today I went about my life as usual, had lunch with friends, did some shopping, got my oil changed. It occurred to me that while I was doing those things, there are children frightened and alone, and I cried. Again.
4008 2018-06-22 22:18:07 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
4009 2018-06-22 22:18:05 I use the oil and these 20mg soft gels. It works, you have to try it.
4010 2018-06-22 22:17:53 It’s simple. They don’t know what it is.
4011 2018-06-22 22:17:26 You bought snake oil, you know it's snake oil but you defend and don't want to admit it's snake oil.  But guess what it's still snake oil! Get your money back!
4012 2018-06-22 22:17:25 Yeah, all this crap about a non–existent GSM. Would cool by just 0.13–0.3°C, 0.3 cooling being a Maunder minimum GSM. None-event in a world warmed by nearly 2°C since the LIA. Still kewling is proving a nice little earner for some snake oil peddlers.
4013 2018-06-22 22:17:20 Si…magnifica colega…pero…MIDNIGHT OIL…tuvo antes que ese disco muy buenos trabajos…y después…también…aunque no tanto…:)
4014 2018-06-22 22:17:19 I miss spending $25 for an oil change on my impala.
4015 2018-06-22 22:17:16 Put out the word! This is on our dime, and it’s all about oil deals and lifting sanctions. Then, a new world order (not with our allies).
4016 2018-06-22 22:16:57 @MissMopar7172 oh I almost forgot did you like the irving blinker fluid  and did the L B D. work better with it!I case you did't know irving oil is huge up here on the east coast of canada eh and they are in maine too! more pictures please?????
4017 2018-06-22 22:16:48 It just cost me $50 to fill my tank, I truly do blame trump and you come at me with the “president doesn’t control the prices” fuck off he controls the relations we have with oil company’s
4018 2018-06-22 22:16:25 It regulates the oil and gas industry.Guess cattle are regulated in kangaroo court. Lol
4019 2018-06-22 22:16:23 and a huge rare price increase in the oil price followed today

4035 2018-06-22 22:14:14 Living in the southeast that oil spill did a lot of damage to the people who make their living catching seafood and selling it to fish markets. The only thing Mr BUFFOONids trump does is see food and stuff into his big hole
4036 2018-06-22 22:14:09 Not even close to the same, jackass. I’m guessing you were paid to go off and work for the oil companies and business interests in these illegal wars. Besides, you’re complaining right this very second, mf. You’re war-ass complaining probably got traction with trump, but not here
4037 2018-06-22 22:13:53 A place where they cut peoples heads off is a place from which dirty oil comes from

4040 2018-06-22 22:13:17 Hmmmmmm but pipelines are the devil!?!?! (not saying you've said that but many believe it) Statistically speaking, pipelines are safest method for transporting oil and gas.  Just saying!
4041 2018-06-22 22:13:11 It shouldn’t take 2 hours to do an oil change and tire rotation on a car @JosephChevrolet
4042 2018-06-22 22:13:08 Canada will SHUT OFF Exports of oil to the states if you make any more threats directed at us.

4047 2018-06-22 22:12:30 Being a regular fake tanner, I strongly do no believe that this baby oil trick removes your fake tan  instead I’ve got exfoliating burns (if that’s a thing?) and two v tired arms  #faketanremovingtipsplz

4053 2018-06-22 22:11:52 If you want to SELL cars in Canada, you have to BUILD THEM HERE. If you don't do that we can buy French, Japanese, German, Korean, English cars etc.  So, DON'T threaten Canada!  Also we can stop shipping you oil.  I can't emphasize enough how poorly Canadians respond to threats.

4063 2018-06-22 22:10:44 They need to hear the case of the Jamaican politicians who refuse to testify in open court about a contribution from an oil company with contracts with the Government of which they were prominent members.  That one woulda exciting.
4064 2018-06-22 22:10:18 Kenny may not be Premier but who else has balls to condemn Trudeau extending Quebec’s getting 10 Billion $ Equalization Oil Welfare money from Alberta annually. Quebec is blocking a east pipeline preventing oil exports yet buy Tanker Oil from Saudi sheiks, Killer Dictators & USA.
4065 2018-06-22 22:10:15 Cool. Cool cool cool. But you know hydrocarbons are a finite resource, right? So, sometime soon(-ish), output will not be able to meet demand irrespective of OPEC. Science matters. Facts matter. Green tech *matters* (and employs more Americans than oil/gas).
4066 2018-06-22 22:10:13 I know... I'm waiting for either a big let down or a big sigh of relief!

4070 2018-06-22 22:10:03 I finally went to Kane’s ... ZERO SEASONING. NONE. At least fry that bish in Peanut oil. 

The fries were a congealed lump of undercooked, unsalted potato mash.

Cole slaw was some miracle whip TRASH.

And GTFOH with that Texas Toast. Cornbread or nothing.

4072 2018-06-22 22:09:55 Happy for the North Coast,but many down here on South Coast asking why we cannot have our coasts protected from oil tankers also? Our coastline matters as well.
4073 2018-06-22 22:09:52 Also why do ALL mechanics have to mansplain???? Last time I got my oil changed the guy thought I didn’t know what an “estimate” was and proceeded to provide me with a detailed description of an estimate for 10 minutes
4074 2018-06-22 22:09:48 You need a fat to grease the tin first - softened butter, Crisco, lard, bacon fat, even veg oil. Make sure there’s not an excessive amount in the cracks. Then shake flour into the tin and keep shaking until all the cooking surface is covered. Shake out the excess.

4078 2018-06-22 22:09:17 I think the best part of moving out is I’m not gonna have to do all these ridiculous things for my mom. For example, I’m getting my oil changed. She looooves one of the employees here and told me I had to pull him aside and tell him. So I did. Now I’ve gotta tell him to text her
4079 2018-06-22 22:09:17 “Jim Bakker Sells "Miracle Gel" Cure For STDs”

What’s really needed is a “miracle cure” for religious snake oil salesmen and grifters.

4085 2018-06-22 22:08:03 (Pt 2) some of the oil it needs to stay hydrated.  Every time they wash their hair, it strips the hair strands of those oils (it does in other races as well, but it accumulates back up faster. Hence the reason hair gets greasy looking so fast.) There really is a reason for them.
4086 2018-06-22 22:07:45 why should uae or opec do anything because u have alienated and tariffed other oil producing countries... maybe you should bite the hands that feed us.  we owe money to a bunch of countries.. be careful or they wont lend us any more money....

4088 2018-06-22 22:07:15 I'm pretty sure we are in agreement about what causes oil prices to rise or fall.  I'm just saying that artificially dumping more oil into the market with the strategic reserve is likely to make prices rise long-term because it will put oil companies out of business.

4092 2018-06-22 22:06:29 I am obsessed with tea tree oil, it’s honestly good for everything and works sooooo good
4093 2018-06-22 22:06:28 (Not your) Buddy Carter, District 1 Georgia supports offshore oil exploration and drilling.  If you live on the Georgia coast, think about what that means.  (Not your) Buddy Carter represents corporate interests, not yours or mine.  @RepBuddyCarter @LisaRingGA01
4094 2018-06-22 22:06:19 I use cbd oil in my vape pen at night of choose mixed with some regular herbs but not only does the cbd have many health benefits , it also seems to help my wife and I both get better sleep at night.

4096 2018-06-22 22:05:51 Not read it all then? Nothing to stop the Scottish Government using any border they want? Do you know how many times they have complained about the movement of the border in relation to oil?
4097 2018-06-22 22:05:33 Dat snake oil.
4098 2018-06-22 22:05:27 When I started college, this creepy guy tried to give me a flower, and I prayed “oh God, show me what to do to make him leave,” and suddenly I was explaining to him how he could actually boil it to use as hair oil for his beard, and he never bothered me again.
4099 2018-06-22 22:05:13 Guy changing my oil asked if they were the last ones to do it, as if I don’t know that I’m overdue.  Like, yeah mother fucker and I don’t need the attitude!
4100 2018-06-22 22:05:10 COCONUT OIL is a brain supercharger.
4101 2018-06-22 22:05:06 did you get your oil change?
4102 2018-06-22 22:04:56 @realDonaldTrump > to be blunt, I am not enjoying my SLOW death by Uranium and other toxic minerals, as the water levels are reduced & toxins increase! 
China Raw Pork PITS in USA needs addressing also!

4104 2018-06-22 22:04:38 Does Abbott explicitly promote dietary intervention that can reverse type 2 diabetes?

A whole food plant based, no oil, >97% vegan diet prevents and reverses type 2 diabetes.

4108 2018-06-22 22:04:04 I'll wager $10,000 that Putin gives something to Trump to make him look better/tougher.
Putin says he will pump more oil to lower price,promise to suspend nuclear missiles that can't be detected,say there will be free elections in Austria
Sorry,I mentioned Crimea.
4109 2018-06-22 22:03:56 The reason I dislike oil changes is that they always find something else wrong with the car. At least the battery is still under warranty...
4110 2018-06-22 22:03:38 Also she can take two spoons daily MORNING and EVENING of VEGAN COCONUT OIL.
4111 2018-06-22 22:03:37 Fuck yeah! I started getting my wife some oil for get seizures. This sale will help out tremendously!! Thanks Joe!

4116 2018-06-22 22:02:42 And higher oil prices to line the pockets of oil producing countries like Putin’s Russia
4117 2018-06-22 22:02:27 Get gas today. It's going to jump big time by Monday afternoon. Oil up 6%
4118 2018-06-22 22:02:17 "Peak oil" was based on justifiable assumptions that proved to be wrong. Peak car is based on wishful thinking.
4119 2018-06-22 22:02:14 Sí sabes que no hay un precio internacional del petroleo como dijo el burro de Peña Nieto verdad? Hay 177 precios diferentes de petroleo, quieres mi fuente? Ahí te va: International Crude Oil Market Handbook. 
4120 2018-06-22 22:01:46 Plus I heard yesterday He was pushing through the Keystone Pipeline too!!! Oil oil oil.
4121 2018-06-22 22:01:46 |; I was supposed to go take my car and get the oil changed. 
But I went home because I was tired. 

I still am tired. 
But I my dad gave me 100$ to get it done. 
   Should probably go do that
4122 2018-06-22 22:01:42 It's the same with Utd fans and Ronaldo and tonnes more. Maybe if your club had any good players before the oil money came through you'd have some worthwhile ex-city players to follow
4123 2018-06-22 22:01:15 And the increase in oil prices pretty much wiped out those tax cut benefits. Also parroting @realDonaldTrump by calling Warren names he created says more about your ignorance then the facts she's trying to give you...
4124 2018-06-22 22:01:12 Oh you mean cleaning up and reclamation of the largest natural oil spill in earths history? That one? Idiots!!!
4125 2018-06-22 22:01:12 Only if the United States of America saw a benefit there in terms of oil, lucrative defence or construction contracts or all three.
4126 2018-06-22 22:01:09 tell him to look into Black seed oil My Brother... cures everything but death Stay Strong 
4127 2018-06-22 22:01:00 I think it's about time we did more of our own domestic oil and energy production and let OPEC choke on their oil, stop letting them hold us hostage with their prices. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
4128 2018-06-22 22:00:56 Wait.  We had an empire?
4129 2018-06-22 22:00:56 Do I know anyone that utilizes CBD oil to treat chronic pain or migraines? What has your experience been like? I wanna know!
4130 2018-06-22 22:00:46 I’m so annoyed my sweater fell out my car as I was getting off and it fell in car oil that was on the floor 
4131 2018-06-22 22:00:43 And how is Canada leading? Canada supports increased GHG from expansion of oil sands & LNG & deep sea drilling, delayed methane regulations, willing to spend billions for pipeline construction, doing nothing to stop logging of old growth forest. Real Leadership.

4136 2018-06-22 22:00:11 That is way too much oil. Also: I make my popcorn in a wok and it is perfect.

4141 2018-06-22 21:59:45 I work in ND shale oil.  Hoping for higher oil prices!!!!   Isn’t that what you promised us recently?
4142 2018-06-22 21:59:39 Huh. I just learned that the Texas Railroad Commission doesn’t have anything to do with railroads. They deal with oil and gas.
4143 2018-06-22 21:59:29 The cure is "faith," Bruce, and when the snake oil doesn't work, Bakker will tell his mark that he/she just wasn't godly enough for it to work.

4145 2018-06-22 21:59:18 I hope Houma-Thibodaux leaders encourage development of more diverse business investment to lessen dependence on oil and gas jobs & revenues. Even if prices continue to rise, oil and gas employment will never be what it was because of increasing automation in the industry.

4149 2018-06-22 21:58:31 I would also like an answer to this as I was aware of ZPE since I was a teen. It would need to be decentralised or open source if it were to be released as people are still profiting from oil and they want to profit till it is depleted.
4150 2018-06-22 21:58:25 @SandsTiffany any chance of a DM. Stepdad has terminal SCLC and we’ve been trying to look in to cannibas oil for a miracle!
4151 2018-06-22 21:58:25 I read the most adorable thing on addicts by Anne Lamott: 

My friends said they drank most hours of the day, but they took some time off to oil each other.
4152 2018-06-22 21:58:22 @KatsNaturals I absolutely love the naked oil I received today. Amazing!

4155 2018-06-22 21:57:55 Regulations and policies protect whales, not money.  Stop subsidizing an increase of emissions in the oil sands and fracking and offshore drilling that are acidifying our oceans and stop increasing dangerous tanker traffic. Fund renewables only & give us EV charging stations.
4156 2018-06-22 21:57:47 the people of Scotland where misled and lied to. More and more are opening their eyes. I suggest you do the same and let go of your tribalism. Most of Scotland’s revenue is sent to the treasury and we get less than half back. And that doesn’t even count the oil revenue
4157 2018-06-22 21:57:44 The black camouflages oil leaks and they can use same parts on NH and CIH maybe? I don't like the black paint on them or the tractors
4158 2018-06-22 21:57:41 I could change the oil in my care with her hair grease.
4159 2018-06-22 21:57:36 Correction: he chose to fight other countries for their oil.
4160 2018-06-22 21:57:24 Yeah, trains where it’s at. Beacham, the railways destroyer, was a nuclear bod. We’d still have trains across Wales if it weren’t part of the dark deals between nuclear, OPEC and the desire to push cars, so not to disrupt the oil con in the ‘60’s.

4163 2018-06-22 21:57:04 It smelled of diesel 40 miles inland in AL, Lower Alabama to locals. We had an earthquake at Dauphin Island. An earthquake, what caused that, millions of gallons oil gushing out of the earth? Bless Our Hearts.
4164 2018-06-22 21:56:35 Well, we just kinda sorta, did a make oil for dummies on twitter Dave lmao
4165 2018-06-22 21:56:33 What a bummer, First we lose our jobs in the oil belt, then we are jammed with a carbon tax, and if that was not ridiculous enough, Quebec is showing us how to control the money we gave them.
4166 2018-06-22 21:56:23 I love how you always write "bipartisan", but whenever there is a very partisan vote, we don't hear from you.  Like taking away CHIP, Medicare and Medicaid.  I hear Trump got rid of an executive order protecting oceans from oil spills, no comment on that?
4167 2018-06-22 21:56:03 Oh you mean that Glenn Beck's rant about Michelle Obama's tank top years ago wasn't a complaint? I don't think that you can compare a jacket that's says "I really don't care" while visiting kidnapped children is the same as wearing a black and white tank top to an oil spill.
4168 2018-06-22 21:55:48 2 hour wait on this oil change. 

Whyeeee?!
4169 2018-06-22 21:55:45 Funny how we keep discovering new oil and gas fields but they are worthless! Oh yeah and oil has been running out for the last 30 years! Anyway if Scotland is a basket case like you think, why would we ever want to tie ourself to the power that had kept us like that?
4170 2018-06-22 21:55:21 The exact opposite of what you think happened today happened, with the largest single-day increase in the price of oil since 2016.

4172 2018-06-22 21:55:14 In case you hadn't noticed, the economy of Alberta isn't what it used to be.  Quebec refuses to explore for natural resources and imports their oil and gas from Iran, Russia, Venezuela, Nigeria down the St Lawrence River.  Is that ok with you?

4176 2018-06-22 21:54:55 I suspect my reasons for hoping for alternative energy may be diff from yours but regardless, its inevitable bc sooner or later the earth will be depleted of oil
4177 2018-06-22 21:54:54 Perhaps or perhaps not, but his thirst for oil, conquest, his overconfidence in his master race, and his decision to obliterate British cities rather than to concentrate on taking out the RAF in preparation for his cross channel invasion were impactful.
4178 2018-06-22 21:54:54 Try using tea tree oil
4179 2018-06-22 21:54:53 Low key hate putting setting power on my face ..

I use rose hip oil and primer (and I have a solid skin routine that maintains my moisture barrier) but I feel like while it changes the game in how ur make up looks it still make me look dryish.

Anyone know any dewy alternatives?
4180 2018-06-22 21:54:48 A nothing clubye can’t even fill your stadium playing some of the best football seen in the premier league, joke club with no fans propped up by middle eastern oil, hope for your sake they never find an alternative to oil
4181 2018-06-22 21:54:20 I was referring to football not American Football. So Terry funk pouring oil over himself in the 70's in the shower while cutting a promo, wasn't a "stupid locker room promo"?
4182 2018-06-22 21:54:12 Weekend plans clean my apartment get new tires for the whip and car wash... maybe an oil change too
4183 2018-06-22 21:54:10 Need to stop myself or I'll be on this all day but to my understanding Venezuela's entire economy is dependent on oil and their currency became worthless when the Saudis deliberately flooded/crashed the market. The freefalls been reinforced but those factors seem more peripheral
4184 2018-06-22 21:53:59 >>2/2.
..but those good souls remain at the bottom of their political pyramid. Rarely ever reach the top, as history has proved. They're there to manipulate perception, Plus, they're not really in control. Politicians come and go . CEOs+Banks+oil+Bloodlines rule the waves :))
4185 2018-06-22 21:53:46 Maybe if we had more  alternatives to oil... oh, that's right, U don't care.

Laramie Rangers take on Rock Springs at 7 p.m. tonight
4193 2018-06-22 21:52:45 Can I also ask which oil it is that smells like the original cleansing balm? Is it superfood or pro-collagen marine?
4194 2018-06-22 21:52:39 News flash! There is plenty of oil in West Texas. It sits. 
There is a huge surplus of oil that is just being stored. Why? Because there is no pipeline to Houston refineries and tanker trucks cost too much for the price of West Texas Crude.Let’s figure that out. No more OPEC.
4195 2018-06-22 21:52:28 I’d rather the oil spill into the potable water aquifer that feeds the drinking water in his district...
4196 2018-06-22 21:52:22 And Libya. And Egypt. And Yemen. And Tunisia. Rogin was writing about stealing Iraq’s oil just a few weeks ago.

4201 2018-06-22 21:52:15 I remember the oil spills I was 12, it was terrible, regardless of my feelings, somehow for my children, grandchildren & the breeding of future wildlife, we must encourage our youth, yesterday an Orca swam to the Thamar River, Into Cornwall, heaven sent! #courage #resilience

4212 2018-06-22 21:51:03 Non-Arab countries aren't noticeably backward by the standards of former colonies.

Arab countries are, but there are other factors at work (arid climate, rentier economies based on oil, wars with Israel and its allies, mismatch between written and spoken language).
4213 2018-06-22 21:50:59 Caution for oil on track

4214 2018-06-22 21:50:58 You probably don’t know this, but the OPEC guys don’t even know exactly how much oil they have left.  They will remain conservative as a result.  P.S....invest in renewable energy.  That’s the wave of the future, not dying fossil fuels and already dead coal.
4215 2018-06-22 21:50:56 Caution is out. Believe a car dropped oil on the track
4216 2018-06-22 21:50:55 Every year there is a ton of talk surrounding teams making deals inside the Top 10 at the NHL Draft and almost always nothing. My guess is we get more of the same in 2018.  #Oilers
4217 2018-06-22 21:50:46 Hey, imagine if Canada had an oil industry and could deliver to markets all over the world!

4219 2018-06-22 21:50:36 #pnpcbc I have most sympathy for NFL as they are in dreadful circumstances since the oil price fell and they are still regarded as a HAVE province.

4223 2018-06-22 21:50:27 Old Bay is popcorn magic... also that is an insane amount of oil they recommend
4224 2018-06-22 21:50:08 Bio oil >.<
4225 2018-06-22 21:50:07 I hope you'll still be able to say that the next time you go to some of the National parks out West, once donnie's oil buddies get started on their new drilling projects.
4226 2018-06-22 21:50:04 Bloody hell, USA. Now they’re keeping you in ignorance, not even bothering with the horse shit. I read this morning that they’re good with oil spills too, now. Please do something before your country, and the world, is utterly lost.
4227 2018-06-22 21:49:24 LMAO, oil was/is expensive, and once we found out the hows and whats involved, we did it for ourselves. No selling lol i didnt realy help lol i just contributed the weed fir the few of us involved lmao
4228 2018-06-22 21:49:08 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
4229 2018-06-22 21:48:57 Of course they would, but not for any of those reasons.

They've got oil.

4231 2018-06-22 21:48:42 Barr,Marky he's clearly a troll churning the same old nonsense as we have heard & disproved time and again as to oil maybe Aberdeen is slowing but there are new techniques & that not the only oil in Scottish water as well Westminster knows to pedal a no oil argument is desperate.
4232 2018-06-22 21:48:15 I remember the BP spill. Weeks on end of wildlife rescue, tourism was damaged, fishermen not allowed to go through work, oil rigs shut down- most of Louisiana is reliant on the coastal economy. These laws were restrictive for reason.
4233 2018-06-22 21:48:07 It is a fact that plenty of oil and natural gas is available for extraction.  Alaska, Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota,  Atlantic & Pacific coasts and the Gulf.  Because OPEC is cheaper than domestic, the govt imports foreign.  The govt must invest and support domestic exploration.
4234 2018-06-22 21:48:04 Let me guess — Afterwards US will resolve to reduce pursuit of green energy solutions, redouble drilling for oil, fracking & coal use.
4235 2018-06-22 21:47:51 #OOTT 
It's not fair to credit #OPEC for the entire #WTI rally today. Part of the rally was an unwinding process after recent sell-off which had priced in the expectation of an ease of #oil production cuts at OPEC June meeting.
4236 2018-06-22 21:47:47 I was like "There's an oil for that? And Pure Fiji makes it?".
4237 2018-06-22 21:47:45 Oil and $$$
4238 2018-06-22 21:47:12 Yes. Oil futures are up. I'm not celebrating.
4239 2018-06-22 21:47:01 I don’t know what’s stranger...if the fact that I’m measuring olive oil from a spray can into a shot glass for my dinner or if now that I’m cooking I’m not sure if I was actually hungry or if my abs are just sore from training #myfitnessjourney #fit2fabulous
4240 2018-06-22 21:47:01 Snake oil.
90 proof snake oil.
4241 2018-06-22 21:46:48 And the CIA put them into evil by overthrowing a peaceful, democratic govt there to emplace our tyrant, the Shah, so BP could get cheap oil.
4242 2018-06-22 21:46:45 So many errors in this statement.  The U.S. is not energy independent (hasn’t been since WWI) and how many of those oil leases were drilled or developed? In fact, Obama’s policies heavily curtailed offshore drilling after Deepwater horizon.
4243 2018-06-22 21:46:31 It's called corporate welfare! Social programs are a mere "pimple on the Federal expenditure pumpkin." Get real, handouts to the oil, natural gas and mining industries are US Corporate Socialism! All in the name of  Capitalism.
4244 2018-06-22 21:45:53 Peppermint oil helps me immensely. Put it on your temples.
4245 2018-06-22 21:45:46 @TheLastLeg 
This week trump has pulled the US out of the UN human rights council and repealed Obamas law protecting the oceans froma repeat of the gulf of mexico oil spill. 
Is he trying to look cool infront of his new bff kim?
4246 2018-06-22 21:45:44 Vitamine E oil appreciation tweet 
4247 2018-06-22 21:45:44 No shit, Sherlock. It’s the current paradigm, one which got us massive progress over the last century (and massive profits for Big Oil), and one which is also destroying us. Thus the shift to the next paradigm, renewables, so that maybe we don’t actually kill ourselves?
4248 2018-06-22 21:45:40 I'm sure dabs aren't floating in peppermint oil and glycin
4249 2018-06-22 21:45:32 Lies, we export enough oil to keep prices down you just don't want your minions to blame you, which they should
4250 2018-06-22 21:45:15 My question is, why is our oil going on to the global market. Our oil and natural gas should be for our people and the prices should not depend on the global Marketplace. You know, America First.
4251 2018-06-22 21:44:39 Got a temporary new car bc @theaaronjett has bad luck and took mine to get the oil changed and the electricity went out and they couldn’t get it down off the lift lmao 
4252 2018-06-22 21:44:25 Lmao, 5 - 10 grans extra, would give you aproximent value say $300 - $500 (if you bought oil for yourself.) So $60 of weed makes ya 4 - 8 grams oil roughly give or take measurement.
4253 2018-06-22 21:44:21 It’s Friday!! Forgot to tweet this morn. Shoulder workout, listened to JayZ and Beyoncé new album(highly recommend), @NaturesUltra cinnamon cbd oil, , and out the door i went. I have been feeling great all day. #cbdlife #ritual #pure #natural #myanchor #morning #takenote
4254 2018-06-22 21:44:14 So I brought my car to dodge to get an oil change and I didn’t know they were gonna be all in my shit lmfaoooo I know this man smells all this weeeeeeddt
4255 2018-06-22 21:43:40 Question: why the GNA has done nothing to get rid of those saboteurs who attack & destroy Libya's Oil&Gas infrastructure repeatedly; like coordinating with AFRICOM to bomb them while in the open, or do they think by denouncing the attack they've fulfilled their duties towards LY
4256 2018-06-22 21:43:39 Still cant believe my boyfriend dumped avocado oil on me last night

4259 2018-06-22 21:43:31 It would literally kill the oil/gas business (billion dollar industry) and America is literally too ass backwards to think green rn

4262 2018-06-22 21:43:09 Make America Great Again - produce your own oil. Don't rely on other countries. That is your "thing" - right ?
4263 2018-06-22 21:43:02 There is no oil shortage oil prices stayed the same for 30 yrs thru the most violent events in history Nixon betrayed us and the Arab Bastards got greedy no POTUS has had the balls to stand up to their greed
4264 2018-06-22 21:42:58 I just give my dog straight CBD oil because he is INSANE.
4265 2018-06-22 21:42:46 I love oil based colored and shaped tree
4266 2018-06-22 21:42:43 "Oil prices rose sharply after OPEC agreed to only a modest increase in output, well below some of the figures that had been discussed ahead of the meeting. [O/R]"
guess the crit meant the pickup driving half.
4267 2018-06-22 21:42:18 One of the stupidest outcomes of this is that tavernas are not allowed to offer free condiments on the table, like olive oil and vinegar. Break the law and they get a €500 fine per table. 

I'll quite happily pay and hope the Germans choke on their dry bread.
4268 2018-06-22 21:42:15 Coconut oil is high in lauric acid and a naturally antiviral, antibacterial & antifungal food. Add 1-2 Tbsp. to your daily Green Smoothie!
4269 2018-06-22 21:42:07 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
4270 2018-06-22 21:41:57 Nope. They’re shysters and conmen, selling snake oil to gullible idiots who believe in magic.
4271 2018-06-22 21:41:48 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
4272 2018-06-22 21:41:47 every time i get an oil change i get hit on. I can’t bro lmao. leave me in my peace
4273 2018-06-22 21:41:47 Except that none of the Canadian oil reaching tidewater goes to asia anyways.
If we've been throwing away all that money, it's not because of shipping. Could the discount actually be because of other reasons -- like quality?
4274 2018-06-22 21:41:42 Anyone defending one Nigeria is a scammer, he want slave he will never get again. Nigeria is a zoo. As i return to my father Biafra,their conspiracy on how to kill us for neocolonialism is exposed. Oil will soon dry up.We will know who is robbing who in Nigeria. #LazyNigeriaYouth
4275 2018-06-22 21:41:32 Maybe, but Oil&Gas CEO’s won’t...
4276 2018-06-22 21:41:27 I’ve been waiting 4 hours for a oil change like wtf ... I had stuff to do
4277 2018-06-22 21:41:22 Welcome to adulthood:
Go in for $40 oil change, leave with $800 bill to fix four wheel drive.
4278 2018-06-22 21:41:16 Unbelievable that. Forget about, stealing our oil, Brexit, Trident & the deindustrialisation which Maggie did to Scotland in the eighties, to name a few. Baby boxes is their beef. What is wrong with this country ffs.
4279 2018-06-22 21:40:56 It’s good for US oil companies, making profit easier to attain.  Thereby driving up stock prices - a good move.
4280 2018-06-22 21:40:43 น่าเบื่ออะ กะเพรา
4281 2018-06-22 21:40:32 Why would Scotland want to track oil just now  better waiting Independant then potentially all revenue goes to Scotland (idea Scotland's taking a stand over concerns over environment play well just now but down the line if Independant Scotland will inevitably sanction  fracking
4282 2018-06-22 21:40:31 Lmao, **not making fun of you Dave** but youve smoked weed for years, and didnt realize what where how of the hash blocks n oil were made etc?
Its realy not rocket science to do it, as some may maje you belief bro. If i could do it you can do it. That simple
4283 2018-06-22 21:40:19 the fact that paint comes in colours u already want is such a wild concept for me. ive literally been using exclusively primary colours in both acrylic and oil for like 4 years pls

4286 2018-06-22 21:40:09 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
4287 2018-06-22 21:40:08 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

4292 2018-06-22 21:39:59 Not every because he was pigeon held by Senate and Congress but that’s another discussion.... oil industry guys are killing it right now making (war ,refinery /gas line explosion )profit at least W. would give an excuse

4297 2018-06-22 21:39:23 Just got an oil change without my dad for the first time, is this what you call adulthood?
4298 2018-06-22 21:39:21 i smell like cooking oil  god damn my love for fried foods
4299 2018-06-22 21:39:18 > You follow him, sitting up as you give his hand a gentle squeeze. 

(no, you totally sound like a lavender oil kinda guy.)
4300 2018-06-22 21:39:10 Oil change needed. Tomorrow
4301 2018-06-22 21:39:05 Mvura ne Oil
4302 2018-06-22 21:39:05 might be a little tough to capture in oil on canvas but is not the freedom to pursue new truth and the expression of it part of the whole point. capture the joy of his liberated soul as he craps right on a BMW
4303 2018-06-22 21:39:00 smart cats know that when El Trumpo tweets, Jesus dies a slow emotional death
4304 2018-06-22 21:38:37 Wow! Looks like most of the oil filled cars derailed and the oil is going into the river
4305 2018-06-22 21:38:29 And keep #SS & #SSDI payments low.  I wonder how many people realize that cost of living raises on both are based on oil prices. Incredible as that sounds. I'm on SSDI and have not had a cost of living increase in at least 5 yrs, maybe more.
4306 2018-06-22 21:38:18 Fun fact, BP Oil was originally Iranian before the brits stoke it
4307 2018-06-22 21:37:53  WELL I went through a period of really bad cystic acne and I'm only now just understanding that I was washing my face WAY too much so I haven't washed my face in over two weeks and it's been ... Also I wear sunscreen everyday and go ham on rosehip oil and vitamin e oil lol
4308 2018-06-22 21:37:52 Chale I make hye oh .i for change my oil .i use petrol ky3 I for use desiel small
4309 2018-06-22 21:37:43 Be happy on high oil prices... the less oil price gets the less dollars are used to buy. The more are flowing back to us. You really understood economy. Hopefully Dollar dominance in oil trades will get down. Then you will realize what it’s about.
4310 2018-06-22 21:37:32 The motive was not christianity but economical and for oil. Wars exist since the first day of humanbeings. But the motive of the Islamist terrorists is clearly Islam. We need to fight against evil ideologies.
4311 2018-06-22 21:37:27 Must have been burning the midnight oil to get it sorted that quick.. Good Luck for tomorrow.. 
4312 2018-06-22 21:36:53 @fordnation When are gas prices coming down? With the move in oil today I wouldn't be surprised to see a spike this weekend.
4313 2018-06-22 21:36:50 I went to 99 Ranch Market just to get some cooking oil 

I left with $60 worth of Asian food.

(you have lavender oil??)
4315 2018-06-22 21:36:47 Coconut oil is the only thing that stops my belly from itching 
4316 2018-06-22 21:36:36 OF course it does - Plastics are made from OIL and TEXAS is BIG OIL 1st before people and pollution !
4317 2018-06-22 21:36:34 Next time you get any weed, get an extra 5 - 10 grams.
You can a couple months of oil off from just a small small batch. Depending how much ya smoke. $80 of oil would last me a month, i smoked it like cigarettes when young and singke lmao
4318 2018-06-22 21:36:25 ...... the dealer. For an oil change ...............
4319 2018-06-22 21:36:05 I hope you will be covering the link between eczema vaccinatum (as eczema used to be called before the link between eczema and vaccination was covered up) and peanut oil in vaccines as the main cause of today’s peanut allergy epidemic?
4320 2018-06-22 21:35:52 1. US is largest oil producer in world. Russia is 2nd largest. They have lots to talk about. 
2. US can’t withstand China powerhouse anymore. Having Russia on side is better than pushing Russia to E. (Last administration)
3. Russia is 12% Muslim. They have understandings US lacks

4330 2018-06-22 21:34:22 Dude, there is a ton of information about the many & varied issues with the environment. 

Google.

Start with bees, then fish. Then look at offshore drilling & oil pipelines. Look at how water from the Colorado River is used & affecting the environment. I can keep going.

4335 2018-06-22 21:33:34 As if you have a clue about how the oil market works.
4336 2018-06-22 21:33:34 As far as PR goes, even you must admit that that was a wrong move. Oh wait, you'd believe anything this snake oil merchant tells you. He could be raping children and you'd still vote for him. Who's the idiot here?
4337 2018-06-22 21:33:30 Hope is not a strategy.  Shouldn't you be taking steps to ensure that the country has enough oil for our needs if OPEC doesn't increase output?  You are the worst businessman and worst dealmaker I've ever seen.
4338 2018-06-22 21:33:23 The only thing that OPEC increase will help us the businesses that but their oil, not the end customer. The NA companies are the ones that need to be monitored/regulated in their price fixing.
4339 2018-06-22 21:33:15 Nice.
4340 2018-06-22 21:33:11 Most guys nowadays know how to roll a blunt , woods , joint but don’t know how to change a cars oil or even patch a tire 
4341 2018-06-22 21:32:56 Like you need an excuse 
4342 2018-06-22 21:32:50 FINALLY getting my oil changed
4343 2018-06-22 21:32:50 thank god it's not oil, otherwise it's gonna be "regime change Tuesday" from now on..
4344 2018-06-22 21:32:39 I respect the need for unity and peace nd I'm also an advocate for both..but football is one of the few things we Nigerians savour..so relating it to any ethnic issues or matters is unacceptable.
4345 2018-06-22 21:32:30 *dumps bottle of stress relief oil in my bathtub* ah yes, this should solve my problems
4346 2018-06-22 21:32:23 This girl in line behind me was talking really loud on the phone complaining that she spent all her last night 
Then complained she didn’t have $ for an oil change or phone bill. Whoever sis was talking to said you owe me money so it’s time to look for a sugar daddy!
4347 2018-06-22 21:32:23 Oooh what’s the Captain Fawcet wax like? I have that Brisk oil  also that washbag is amazing!
4348 2018-06-22 21:32:17 Very clean. I love the feeling. I carry an old pill bottle of oil with me in my purse. Easy to do anywhere on the go after a meal too. Easy to disguard in a napkin. a teaspoon or a bit more.
4349 2018-06-22 21:31:48 What about the saudis and Iranians and Palestinians who rob their entire populations of oil monies and have over 40% unemployment and force their populations to study the Koran instead of getting real educations?
4350 2018-06-22 21:31:28 Try coconut oil on your edges, don't plait your hair for a coupla months...
4351 2018-06-22 21:31:23 Nah, we don't have enough oil.
4352 2018-06-22 21:31:19 Your a bottom feeding snake oil salesmen, who cares
4353 2018-06-22 21:31:18 Definitely do NOT take oil of oregano on its own, usually mixed in water, but can be mixed in juices/shakes too. Black seed oil can be taken on its own or mixed in juices/shakes 
4354 2018-06-22 21:30:59 The government of Malaysia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Gisele Bündchen in a flannel wig.
4355 2018-06-22 21:30:59 The price of oil IS down from where it was artificially raised under the last Republican President. When gas prices were at $1.25 per gallon in early 2000s, the price of oil per barrel was at this level.

What gives, sir?

4357 2018-06-22 21:30:49 the problem (for me) is that this snake oil salesman presents himself as a preacher of the teachings of Jesus Christ. Jesus himself stood in the margins, with the marginalized, and he called his followers to do the same.
4358 2018-06-22 21:30:49 City plastic bag ban trashed by Texas Supreme Court; We talk with the newest TSC justice, Jimmy Blacklock; Oil & gas rig count and related news; The deeper story about that misleading crying girl photo used as Leftist propaganda + the news of Texas, 5 to 7pm on Pratt on Texas.
4359 2018-06-22 21:30:48 Saudi Arabia has been a huge indirect threat to the US, with their money all over Al Quaida and/or other Radical Islamic Terrorism. 

So, are we turning another blind eye for money/oil/cheaper energy?
4360 2018-06-22 21:30:46 It's never a good sign when you hear the guy that's doing your oil change say "huh... I've never seen that before." 
4361 2018-06-22 21:30:33 Most of them were saying buy the energy names ($CHK, $MRO, $COP) except for @grassosteve who said not to due to the big move today.  Fwiw, Seaburg said oil was going back under $40 from $45 and up.  Only recently did he come on board (although he said fade $XOM today)
4362 2018-06-22 21:30:27 Lower oil prices will piss off Big Oil execs...
4363 2018-06-22 21:30:20 RT @LivingSafely: Frito Lay's #Cheetos this June? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.
4364 2018-06-22 21:30:19 Mini Kelly Rutherford was trapped in a  pair of tongs but was saved by a materials scientist wearing hot sauce covered in Olive oil who was sadly eaten by a cowardly Harlequin Duck who had a third nostril made of dysprosium

4368 2018-06-22 21:29:52 Clean energy? You mean the stuff made from oil and/or products taken from massive pits in the ground, then their toxic effluent dumped in pits of toxic goo? The pictures out of China are quite something. Maybe more carbon tax will fix it.
4369 2018-06-22 21:29:42 You tube fast easy way making hash oil. One guy can show you in 3 fast easy steps. And youd have a year supply in a no mess or fuss way within 2 days n no baby sitting the stuff. Let it do its own work.
4370 2018-06-22 21:29:38 You can get your oil changed literally anywhere but my mama making me take her car to the Honda dealership for tf what
4371 2018-06-22 21:29:36 When i have a sore throat or sore tooth i pull with a bit of oil of oregano added to the oil and i swear by it fir faster healing.

Why not add safe edible mint extract to the oil for pulling for fresh feel. 
4372 2018-06-22 21:29:13 I really need the sunflower oil 
4373 2018-06-22 21:29:13 I'm going to get in trouble for that opinion.
4374 2018-06-22 21:29:09 Can’t wait to get my hair done , jus put this hot oil treatment in 
4375 2018-06-22 21:28:44 How about restricting oil from reaching the coast..??????
4376 2018-06-22 21:28:43 In a just society, we'd equate punching someone in the face with soul-crushing passive aggressive manipulation and the statistics would be a lot more balanced.
4377 2018-06-22 21:28:37 Well thank heavens you are already light skinned and couldn’t resort to bleaching or something
4378 2018-06-22 21:28:36 It was, it was a fabrication by the Tories & Labour there’s no oil and all of a sudden there’s enough for at least another 100 years at least
4379 2018-06-22 21:28:34 If Musa na Ronaldo we for don Hear  ,Ronaldo (Musa) single handedly carried his team
4380 2018-06-22 21:28:24 Wic jaga jaga,ur head no gt oil,smh.we were more organized than even d Iceland
4381 2018-06-22 21:28:22 We just started using hemp oil for The Others. Can't wait to read your review! 
4382 2018-06-22 21:28:17 Last time OPEC increased production the ‘oil boom’ in ND went bust and a lot of people lost their jobs. Chump has no understanding of how this works.
4383 2018-06-22 21:28:14 Trump & GOP are hell-bent on destroying our planet.Oil leaks in rivers & oceans,toxic chemicals   in air & water,supporting the dying coal industry,on & on.
4384 2018-06-22 21:28:05 Does anyone know any good flaky scalp remedies? I’ve tried tea tree oil shampoo and it doesn’t work for me help pls
4385 2018-06-22 21:27:58 Ugg. Not for me. Brushing makes me gag and mint toothpaste burns my mouth. Could be related to my extensive allergies but i prefer oil pulling. Been doing it for 2 yrs. Lard is a experiment. Coconut oil is gross to me.
Could always add a drop of mint extract to your oil i suppose
4386 2018-06-22 21:27:55 I bought an air fryer today and cooked fried chicken with no oil at all! Haha ang saya ko.
4387 2018-06-22 21:27:54 Trumpers are already addicted to the kool-aid and the bait and switch Trump con game. Trump will continue to use his shell game to deceive and offer more snake oil for the cult of followers. Trump thinks he's accountable to nobody.
4388 2018-06-22 21:27:39 You are right ! It's all about Energy and Weapons --Oil, Nuclear Plants and Nuclear weapons--. The mid-east countries let the oil flow cheap for exchange for weapons and Nuclear Tech. The US, Ukraine, Russia, Germany , France supply the Nuke Tech and weapons.
4389 2018-06-22 21:27:39 yep. they’re tryna say shit happens & it wasn’t the cause of them. my mechanic looked. they didn’t change the filter, top me off, & may have put in the wrong oil or mixed new oil with the old.
4390 2018-06-22 21:27:34 So in context, put hippie weed in a tub or pail with lid with the ingredients in it, after 24 or 48 hrs use a strainer, seperate it, and theres your oil. A year supply on 1 oz of hippie or shake.
Cheap n simple.
4391 2018-06-22 21:27:25 Donovan Russell and TJ Habetler limited the opposition to one hit but ChannelCats 14U Purple fell to the Oil City Stags 2-0 in Grand Haven today.
4392 2018-06-22 21:27:21 Mineral oil
4393 2018-06-22 21:27:01 @flippinkath lol! i was gona say that stuff is pure snake oil
4394 2018-06-22 21:26:57 5 Goals for the oil
4395 2018-06-22 21:26:54 I have 2 ideas I would like to mention here.
1) Triggers/switches that change water level. Like in labyrinth the water automatically rises in act 3.
2) Other liquids you can swim in.
Maybe  not just water (and probably oil and quicksand) but lava ypu can swim in with fire shield.
4396 2018-06-22 21:26:53 I agree! I used CBD oil for my nausea from radiation treatments. Never abused my opioid meds have several bottles that were never used.
4397 2018-06-22 21:26:52 God bless the comrade.
4398 2018-06-22 21:26:47 So that Halliburton could get at the United States' oil reserves.
4399 2018-06-22 21:26:22 Guess he is just trying to use the man of the moment to preach the need for unity for good things, and unity against what is bad.
4400 2018-06-22 21:26:15 Fill thine horn with oil, and go!
4401 2018-06-22 21:25:53 Thank you. I must obtain some oil noe
4402 2018-06-22 21:25:43 Let's hope Farhad is right. Could mean that American cities will eventually become smart + sustainable too. If Trump discovers he's out of coal and oil, and that robots have stolen jobs, not the Mexicans. Or will he build a firewall? ;-) 
As EU guy, I'm not sure anymore...
4403 2018-06-22 21:25:18 PSA: check your oil
4404 2018-06-22 21:25:18 Support you
4405 2018-06-22 21:25:16 This chart all makes it all clear Russia has Oil Money Guns Real Estate etc and they have been laundering money thru there banks here in the US until they were sanctioned but it all leads to Trump
4406 2018-06-22 21:25:11 Incredible recovery given that Scottish oil fields were running on empty four years ago. Just amazing.

If ye believed in conspiracies  ye would think a nation was lied too in 2014.
4407 2018-06-22 21:25:01 Ororo no be crude oil
4408 2018-06-22 21:24:55 Skjdkhf im losing it at u making me go from steam motor to oil motor, cant believe an industrial revolution happened bc of sprout hobi thank u

4410 2018-06-22 21:24:50 One day you’re young until you finally find the highly sought after wood oil. Then your teen looks at you with disgust and shame. Now you’re just old. Forever in her eyes. A geriatric fuck. #momlife
4411 2018-06-22 21:24:39 if you haven’t added it to your routine, a gentle toner helps with dry skin too because it removes dirt but balances out the natural oils in your skin. I use Fresh’s deep hydrating toner but it’s kinda expensive 

I heard DHC Deep Cleansing Oil is good as cleansed too
4412 2018-06-22 21:24:34 You forgot the British govt continuous GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra in Nigeria to steal oil and gas and the jihadists UN is SILENT.Maybe they need pictures of the Children of British govt continuous GENOCIDE for oil.
4413 2018-06-22 21:24:22 ですね、CK-4のケミカルリミットはCJ-4を踏襲しているのでCK-4でもDH-2併記の継続は可能です。
なお、CK-4と同時に省燃費規格としてFA-4も導入されました。と言ってもHTHS粘度を下げただけなので、xW-30のDH-2と粘度は似た感じなのですが。JASOもDH-2Fなんて省燃費規格を作りましたけど。
4414 2018-06-22 21:24:13 My beard oil was supposed to have notes of bourbon and oak. Instead I have the constant scent of a small pets cage filled with wood chips in my nose.
4415 2018-06-22 21:24:11 I Think Vavoline The Only Oil Change Place That Lets You Sit In The Car While You Get It .
4416 2018-06-22 21:24:11 IFO Egyptian mummy remains were used to make oil paint until they reportedly ran out of mummies.
4417 2018-06-22 21:24:05 Bloody Hipsters: you’ll want a choice of beard oil next ! 
4418 2018-06-22 21:24:05 Had me waiting for over 3 hours bc they did to another car what was supposed to be done to mine. All I need was an oil change and a flat repair 
4419 2018-06-22 21:24:04 No not at all. I’m very interested in the oil and renewable energy industry. I would love more experience in the oil business. How did you get involved?
4420 2018-06-22 21:24:02 Pulling oil through teeth to clean your mouth&teeth. For about 5 mins. swish around, spit out. Oil pulls out food particles stuck near & just under gums & between teeth and carries the bad bacteria & newly forming plague out when u spit. Done instead of brushing w/abrasive paste
4421 2018-06-22 21:23:54 No..I'm saying why did he even have to bring Ahmed musa's tribe into it..I'm not saying he's being tribalistic
4422 2018-06-22 21:23:51 Follow the oil.
4423 2018-06-22 21:23:26 Gas prices have nothing to do with taxes. But energy independence does, which Trump is working hard on. Fuck Saudi Arabia and their oil!
4424 2018-06-22 21:23:23 Ok done that. Did not tell me anything which I did not know. However, wrong to compare to Kuwait, economically no comparison. Plus North Sea Oil only became of value after 1973 and is now in the main extracted. Plus of course now there is climate change. Sorry no value
4425 2018-06-22 21:23:15 But only if it was white people being affected, or if the United States of America had oil or other resources.
4426 2018-06-22 21:23:10 Proud of what?....Betsy DeVos who is completely unqualified?....As is Rick Perry....Jeff Sessions is fighting the opioid epidemic with a war on pot and quoting the bible as defense for taking kids at the border and Pruitt is a flat out criminal who is working 100% for big oil.
4427 2018-06-22 21:23:07 WTF? I can’t unsee that. How many Fosters oil cans before posing nude seems like a good idea. #aussierules
4428 2018-06-22 21:22:53 Naturellement, toute cause doit avoir ses démons (les big oil pour le CO2, Monsanto pour les OGM,big pharma pour les vaccins, et ainsi de suite), et ses sauveurs : Al Gore, le GIEC, Nicolas Hulot, Gilles Éric Séralini, et de nombreux autres, revendiquent ce statut.
4429 2018-06-22 21:22:50 Isn’t plastic petroleum?? Seems to me it should be like little non biodegradable pieces of black gold. Oil that is.
4430 2018-06-22 21:22:45 I would think this should prevent trump from winning any Gulf of Mexico state. Remember the clods of black oil on beaches?
4431 2018-06-22 21:22:40 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
4432 2018-06-22 21:22:38 Hallucinatory failed president Trump thinks he alone can suck more oil out of the ground.
4433 2018-06-22 21:22:28 Wallahi mu munyarda a bawa musa oil well
4434 2018-06-22 21:22:05 Butter the cress, then squeeze of sea salt, a dry when tossed in the burgers and cook for 30 minutes, or sunseed oil if necessary.
4435 2018-06-22 21:22:03 Oga, he is preaching against tribalism. Take your time to read between the lines.
4436 2018-06-22 21:21:56 I'm gonna start using castor oil on my body
4437 2018-06-22 21:21:48 My face is an oil well. USA and Arab countries should invade soon.
4438 2018-06-22 21:21:42 No but it’s still fun so far even though I’m trash. I think with each iteration they’ve tried to one up the arcade-y feel. The 64 version didn’t have all the various power ups and skills that the subsequent games have had. This one doesn’t even let you play a full 6 game set.
4439 2018-06-22 21:21:34 Stop trading oil as a commodity on Wall Street. Base everything on supply and demand. It's businessmen screwing up prices.
4440 2018-06-22 21:21:20 Love argon oil
4441 2018-06-22 21:21:13 We don't rely on OPEC for oil but for REFINED oil...
4442 2018-06-22 21:21:12 It happened here recently, price of oil tanked, meaning so did gas prices...the government in order to make their GDP look better taxed the hell out of gas to make the price seem normal...it's cargo cult economics.
4443 2018-06-22 21:21:00 These oil companies are js fighting over fijian workers. Ones raising their rate,the other isn't letting no fijian quit & raising their rate even higher lol we're talking $22-$25 an hour. 
Anybody's husband looking for work? Lol
4444 2018-06-22 21:20:59 It’s the best way to sell Snake Oil- 
You have a good cop bad cop routine going on here, where Trump is playing to the American People, & Ivanka is looking out for the interests of Trump Inc, making sure those interests align w Trump’s agenda & Trump’s agenda aligns w Trump Inc.
4445 2018-06-22 21:20:58 Saudis able to get OPEC to pump more crude oil?
4446 2018-06-22 21:20:53 Apparently Trudeau prefers to import Oil rather than Export. He sees our oil as dirty.  Not surprised by market reaction
4447 2018-06-22 21:20:51 This is Nigeria.  Of course, on a per capita basis, it is a disgusting tragedy.  Yet there is oil wealth so...
4448 2018-06-22 21:20:48 *runs to u with motor oil*
4449 2018-06-22 21:20:46 Shouldn't you be more worried about the flooding and oil spill that is occurring today in your district?  Do something besides spew hatred.
4450 2018-06-22 21:20:37 'fundamentals appear more than sound' > well that made me chuckle  what fundamentals would that be ?
FFS its been 11 years with ZERO production or sales and nothing carried on their balance sheet

4457 2018-06-22 21:19:31 the best thing to use for scars is a cream called medihoney !! you can get it prescribed I think but it’s so much better than bio oil and stuff like that, it helps them fade so quickly x
4458 2018-06-22 21:19:28 Oil Catcher ?
4459 2018-06-22 21:19:22 Because oil will last forever!  Ask anyone!
4460 2018-06-22 21:19:19 I hate driving a Lexus. It‘s expensive as hell monthly, horrible mileage on premium gas, and uses up extra quarts of oil. Waste of money all for a name....

4462 2018-06-22 21:19:07 Oil sands are dead. Liberal govt willfully scrapped them via Butts green agenda.  Contracts are gone. Alberta is toast.
4463 2018-06-22 21:19:00 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
4464 2018-06-22 21:18:51 Trend is up primarily because the year-over-year change in oil is up. With oil stabilizing, the YoY change in oil will soon stabilize as well.

Inflation is really an oil/commodities play.

4468 2018-06-22 21:18:07 If she's getting oil then make sure she also gets blinker fluid so they don't go out. Yellow for the front and red for the back
4469 2018-06-22 21:18:06 I can't believe no one else has mentioned CBD oil yet. I was just about to. It's definitely helped my anxiety and insomnia. I still take a low dose of Valium but much less then I would need without it.

4484 2018-06-22 21:16:47 It's not so much in the name.. it's in the government ownership and running of companies an business.. Hitler did just that. ... Venensuala nationalized all oil business, went to socialism and collapsed. That what happens.
4485 2018-06-22 21:16:35 Gangs exported from the USA? That’s why Maduro and Chavez and their families are rich from the oil reserves and the rest of the nation is starving?  Please
4486 2018-06-22 21:16:19 How much is she selling the snake oil for?
4487 2018-06-22 21:15:44 During the Ontario election, gas was hovering around a $1.40 a litre in the GTA, now it is hovering around $1.30 a litre. The dollar has fallen, crude oil is up and issues at a couple of refineries. Interesting

4490 2018-06-22 21:15:37 Definitely found my go to beard oil company now. Honest Ape is amazing.
4491 2018-06-22 21:15:33 Disappointing, but not surprising. Since plastic bags are a byproduct of the oil and gas industry.
4492 2018-06-22 21:15:30 Would not be surprised to see Gallogly look to Oklahoma's oil & gas industries & or infrastructures to aid in or be a part of OU's answers to future funding sources/endowments in one way or another!
4493 2018-06-22 21:15:29 The plan was and still is to find a way to lift sanctions on Russia so Trump and Putin can profit off of the oil. Exxon Mobile can't help Russia drill for it until the sanctions are lifted. It's always about the money. Follow the money!

4496 2018-06-22 21:15:08 Use oils

— Oil boosts hair growth so when washing, lather your hair with coconut oil or olive oil.
— Try and use an olive oil conditioner.
— Make sure your shampoo doesnt have any sulfates or parabens. 
— If you have thin hair use a very little bit of coconut oil.

4497 2018-06-22 21:15:06 It's kinda like all those countries that removed subsidies on gasoline then want Saudi to increase production to lower oil prices.
4498 2018-06-22 21:15:04 Making towards the kitchen, Alena puts on an apron and began to prep her items. Beef, and some greens. Dessert was a pie with multiple fruits. First was oil and she places the slices of meat into the metals. Once that was done, greens were after, she began to use herbs.

4520 2018-06-22 21:12:39 He doesn't realise Canada is the largest exporter of oil to the US and with the way he been treating us we may just cut off the supply them boom 40 percent of your oil is gone
4521 2018-06-22 21:12:33 Exporting oil doesn't increase prices.  Multiple rigs were shut down when the prices dropped lower.  They will open back up if the price keeps rising.  That's supply and demand.  Trump dumping oil out of the strategic reserves would significantly worsen the problem.
4522 2018-06-22 21:12:19 Pleased for you. Them guys are soooo helpfull. I’m getting a share in a Nigerian oil field since one got in touch about my uncle Bobogo leaving me it in his will

4529 2018-06-22 21:11:07 Boss, while hoping OPEC increases output as we hope our own old producing industry increases output, we ask you to be careful in allowing too much off shore drilling. Americans and the world do not want a Gulf of Mexico oil disaster repeat.

4531 2018-06-22 21:11:01 From a revenue point of view, legalising cannabis would be like striking oil, bigtime. Govt grown weed, made for pennies, sold at £120/oz including 50% tax. 

If the govt got £60 for every oz smoked today, you could have your £350m/week and then some.

We could afford to stay in!
4532 2018-06-22 21:10:41 First OPEC flooding the market with oil was bad for our economy. Or at least that’s the song and dance played when Obama was in office.   Now trump sees gas prices going up during his time and suddenly, OPEC flooding the market is a good thing
4533 2018-06-22 21:10:40 Oh, YOU don't really care about oil prices or the AMERICAN PEOPLE.... it's always about , YOU.... aNd making YOU look  good .

i think my dreams are giving me very bad car care advice
4545 2018-06-22 21:09:36 @OPECnews Iran should cut off any oil to any one that sells oil to trump administration. Show trump the real way to make a deal. It’s not by being a pompous ass!

4566 2018-06-22 21:07:15 At this point, we’ve really simplified it to 1 cup oil, 1 egg, 1 tbs lemon juice. It works every time. But it only lasts a couple of weeks in the fridge, because Michael can’t have salt, and I can’t have sugar. Key is the immersion blender and jar, though.
4567 2018-06-22 21:07:10 It doesn't matter if we increase production or not. Imported oil from the middle east will always be lower cost than producing our own due to higher labor rates, insurance subsidies and overhead here in the US.
4568 2018-06-22 21:07:09 No collision? Who is more fool? The fool or the fool who follows the fool? Putin wants the oil freed up among other things. The elitist trump one hand washes the other.
4569 2018-06-22 21:06:01 I read it, I’m just saying accidents happen, and no I don’t want oil spills or any other spills or leaks in the lakes or oceans.

4587 2018-06-22 21:03:28 You know why carbon tax is important right? 

The oil companies take perfect earth & they add a man made chemical bleach & then it all turns into carbon oils&the government has to give them  the carbon tax to bribe them to make less and it saves us from that CRAP.
4588 2018-06-22 21:03:25 Just look at his career sv% pretty consistent. With that said, he never grabbed the reins as the No. 1 with the Sens and while he did just that w/ the Sabres, the team has been awful. When the collective is that bad, G performance will often vary.

4598 2018-06-22 21:01:59 Why don’t we just drill all over the place. Lay oil pipelines everywhere. It’s a national park you say?  We’ll drill there too.  We need more coal too!  Get those kids working in the mines!  Actually relocate your detention centers and put em to work!!
4599 2018-06-22 21:01:42 Just changed the oil in FARMTRUCK. I have no idea when it was done previously, but it was black. Not overly gooey though, so probably just about right.

4608 2018-06-22 21:01:00 Finally got my oil changed today. It was only 2,000 miles late........
4609 2018-06-22 21:00:51 No, I’m saying is the serious revenue from North Sea oil was badly mismanaged by Westminster. Norway discovered it the same year as Scotland. Norway created a sovereign oil fund. UK used it as a levy for the borrowing that resulted in the credit crunch
4610 2018-06-22 21:00:48 Girl I use Carmex too. It’s this lip gloss I get all the time from the beauty supply store for $1.99. It’s call Broadway, it’s a lip oil/lip gloss it keeps your lips moisturize and glossed. And it’s not sticky.

4625 2018-06-22 20:59:27 Yes, but snake oil salesman #Trump would tell the farmer that because of his tax cut the farmer will #not have to pay any #estate #tax.
4626 2018-06-22 20:59:24 No way! But, CBD Oil is wonderful and many brands make a quality product, you should try it!

4630 2018-06-22 20:59:12 Quite. The P&J should/could be WHFPing its way through the structural economic problems of the north - from oil/renewables to NC500 - and it's not doing.
4631 2018-06-22 20:59:12 Well it sounds like you just aren’t committed enough to Sparkle Motion, Gwynn. Also, go to the store and get some damn salt spray with argan oil from the hair care section.
4632 2018-06-22 20:59:03 Lol
4633 2018-06-22 20:59:01 I love oil right now. It was the OPEC cuts that brought oil from 72 down to 64. That's now behind us. My fav is $BTE, but I think they're probably in the penalty box for a Q, so I opened in $ATH.TO at 1.69. It was knocking at 2 when oil tanked, and that's my target here.
4634 2018-06-22 20:58:50 I’m surprised you’ve not had a bonfire of the Neck Oil yet? You’re being unusually restrained!
4635 2018-06-22 20:58:48 why we have our own oil leave opec
4636 2018-06-22 20:58:41 But in reality if he gets better benefits and paid better. As a fighter, that’s better for him. Just was looking forward to more ufc fights after his Belfort fight.

4650 2018-06-22 20:56:15 Colin, take oil alone. Look at Norway’s oil fund. We have no oil fund. Unforgivable. 40 odd years of squandering our oil resources. We generate 25% of renewable energy of the whole of Europe. They’ve sucked the marrow from our bones and we get food banks.
4651 2018-06-22 20:55:58 My Google survey just asked if my residence electricity was fueled by oil.. that is creeeeeeeepy

4657 2018-06-22 20:54:58 My dear President let’s get our next National Chairman from a South South state (oil/gas producing) to enhance our party adding at least one more state where the Chairman comes from.
4658 2018-06-22 20:54:52 My husband worked in the energy sector for over a decade. It declined bc of surplus oil but is making a rapid come back. 
4659 2018-06-22 20:54:51 2) Before I got more into chemical exfoliants, I found rosehip oil and turmeric very effective in lightening my dark marks and would still highly recommend both. I was specifically using a tumeric cream by Vicco!
4660 2018-06-22 20:54:41 That’s an ignorant statement you made.  There’s no such thing as “foreign” minerals. Ask someone who trades commodities.  Similar to oil.  Minerals, oil, commodities are global markets. We live in a global market. Trump is too ignorant to understand this. Global market.
4661 2018-06-22 20:54:39 Coconut oil is the bombbbbb. My favvvv
4662 2018-06-22 20:54:27 Keep pissing off Canada and we'll turn off the spigot. You want to threaten tariffs on cars imported into America?  Well the price of cars will be so high for American consumers that they won't have to worry about how high gas prices will get without Canadian oil.
4663 2018-06-22 20:54:27 exactly its been about oil all along! THAT is where they want to make their big bucks! trump was multi-tasking, as he was torturing asylum seekers for a distraction he snuck thru policy to drill in our oceans again. Pruitt is an oil exec,operating in the W.H
4664 2018-06-22 20:54:21 let’s gather together American citizens permanently separated from loved ones coz of US war & oil industries & creation of fake threats (like this tweet or false WMD reports), meaning Americans go to war not for our safety but rather for the interests of billionaires like #Trump!
4665 2018-06-22 20:54:04 Do we have enough oil for that to be true? 
4666 2018-06-22 20:54:02 Dad went to change my oil dropped my car, and broke the radiator. I run his truck out of gas. Boy we are the perfect two.

4671 2018-06-22 20:53:28 You want America to be supporting the barely regulated oil practices of Russia, Indonesia, and 3rd World countries who are doing incredible environmental damage to our planet instead of the heavily regulated and environmentally safer practices of America. That makes no sense.
4672 2018-06-22 20:53:26 Now not only do the Feds have Alberta's oil exports sewn up in the KM pipeline but they now control the royalty money vis-a-vis equalization payment status quo. They've run circles around Notley. "Pick up your tools!" and do what?
4673 2018-06-22 20:53:18 "what you think is what you get"
from a song. very powerful meaning.

As what Phoenix, Prime, and everyone here says, look INSIDE. you might need an oil change or there could be a problem with the alternator.

4675 2018-06-22 20:53:12 Sorry dear 
4676 2018-06-22 20:53:10 $TECK I've loved commodities, and I've been trying to figure out a non-microcap, diversified way of playing it. Teck is exposed to oil, which is great, but also copper, zinc and steelmaking coal. Oil is on fire, but copper and zinc are also sexy. In at 34.54, target of 38+.
4677 2018-06-22 20:52:52 Well. It may be a problem in the long run But I am sort of happy, that there still, are unused resources. My late dad. Drilled for oil, in Sweden, when I was a child. It was abandoned. Because the cost of extraction. Was higher then, the profit to be gained.
4678 2018-06-22 20:52:48 It's a toss up. I think he might win NY yet.
4679 2018-06-22 20:52:36 With due respect, I pay my own oil change & wear/tear maintenance. If someone totals my car, I call my agent....I notice the Frederick free-market principle that an oil change neither breaks my bank account nor requires an EMR (complete with maintenance agreement). Like that.
4680 2018-06-22 20:52:35 The deep state globalist Khazarian cabal control the oil cartels & fix blame on anyone that opposes their agenda. Real PATRIOTS are not deceived Trump wins again 2020. Keep crying over your failed logic.
4681 2018-06-22 20:52:31 Oil prices are down, internationally because of American oil production

4696 2018-06-22 20:50:32 For me, I'll be holding that coupon for Alaska if it doesn't expire. I guess I'm just concerned over exchange and accumulation rates b/w oil, coal and steel. Still glad we're going to see Alaska though. And Arsenal is loaded with potential.

Any chance you’re using a beeswax base?

4715 2018-06-22 20:47:54 There's still quite a lot left!  However oil still represents something like 10-15% of Scottish economy, so we'd be sensible to take steps to invest in and develop other areas so that we're well placed for the future.

4731 2018-06-22 20:46:08 Of course Trump repealed protections for our oceans from oil spills. It meets Trump's 2 primary ideologies. He's in favor of anything that helps big business get bigger. AND he's the world's #1 OBAMAPHOBE. If Obama did it, Trump's against it, even if he doesn't understand it.
4732 2018-06-22 20:46:03 That 4.6% jump in oil prices is going to consume some of those chintzy tax "breaks" that only some people were able to temporarily crow about.

4759 2018-06-22 20:43:16 nothing has happened in North Korea yet we have been in this positionmany times before & nothing happened then either. Unemployment has been going down for years thank you Obama. And as for producing more oil they want to do it by destroying our coastlines and our national parks

4767 2018-06-22 20:42:29 We are proud of our Govt & the PM and the Home Minister. We have gained such capacity of establishing oil refinery in Mongolia. Thanks.

4779 2018-06-22 20:39:33 Ah, no. I don’t want to be like China or India. Have you been to China? It’s cool in some ways, but not the densely packed humanity and the pollution. We have a relatively low population density and that is a huge asset comparable to oil reserves. Less people is better.
4780 2018-06-22 20:39:20 The US is a net exporter of oil. OPEC production does not impact domestic oil prices.

4782 2018-06-22 20:39:14 So picking a trade war with one of Americas oil suppliers (Canada) wasn't such a good idea after all.
4783 2018-06-22 20:39:13 High porosity hair needs a good moisture/protein balance and always make sure that when you apply your products use a sealant like olive or coconut oil so the moisture doesn’t evaporate so quickly. Deep condition weekly and you should see good results.

4812 2018-06-22 20:36:07 Mr. President we need investment in green energy and green fuels. Less dependency on oil and gas. Climate change isn't a Chinese hoax, it's a reality  that needs to be taken very seriously. Stop taking oil and gas company bribes and do what's right for humanity and the Earth.

4818 2018-06-22 20:35:20 Hats off to Falih & Novak for keeping the #OPEC production cuts deal alive while taking into account customer needs. A stable #oil price will help divert investments to conventional developments greatly needed in the future + maintain interest in oil on the long term. #OOTT

4900 2018-06-22 20:25:56 I always use oil/moisturizer. I use a lot thought that’s probably the difference
4901 2018-06-22 20:25:50 When will you come out with an avocado oil tartar sauce?
4902 2018-06-22 20:25:27 Nothing like messing with popcorn oil to find out you've got a paper cut.
4903 2018-06-22 20:25:27 Not me I work in the oil field!
4904 2018-06-22 20:25:24 We already subsidize all of your frivolous habits. Like D.C. restaurants. Hotels etc.  You bastards wont even help American families fight oil and utility companies.
4905 2018-06-22 20:25:22 today or monday the top in oil in your models?
4906 2018-06-22 20:25:13 Habanero oil and maybe some ground rosemary. And butter and salt.
4907 2018-06-22 20:25:12 @JasonGregor with bolts not upping Kunitz, would he make sense for the Oil as a cheap veteran depth winger that brings a different element?

4911 2018-06-22 20:24:57 Yesss! I’ve tried adding powder to touch up but I feel like my face looks a little cakey after that, so now I use oil blotting paper things lol

4915 2018-06-22 20:24:39 Lol. It's funny when I propose our country reducing our oil supply to put the squeeze on Trump and somehow I am uneducated Trump follower
4916 2018-06-22 20:24:36 Off to grab some hash oil at the weed shoppe anyone need anything? it's just 200m away
4917 2018-06-22 20:24:35 I miss that motor oil.
4918 2018-06-22 20:24:17 Jim
The oil - whoever it belonged to - was sold a  long time ago. How about the future?
4919 2018-06-22 20:24:06 I hate getting an oil change after work I be dozing off while I wait
4920 2018-06-22 20:24:00 castor oil <<< use everyday b4 bed , (massage in)
4921 2018-06-22 20:23:51 I hope it doesn’t feel too fried. That low shampoo will probably be good because it won’t strip too much of the remaining oil out
4922 2018-06-22 20:23:46 Where he belongs at this stage.  He can juice and the old snake oil  salesman has another recognizable name
4923 2018-06-22 20:23:41 Why does #QC hurt canadians pockets so badly!!

4928 2018-06-22 20:22:51 This government has paid to bring "democracy" to the Eastern countries. Mexico and Central American couriers ate being runned by crime. That is why this people are running away from. The oil is a big pull in this government, people are not.

4930 2018-06-22 20:22:42 Russia & Saudi Arabia are joining together to put the squeeze on the rest of OPEC.  Both can live with $60 oil and want to pump more.

4931 2018-06-22 20:22:40 dralex: Part 1 of #HOTSPOTS sees @AlexCrawfordSky in Nigeria discovering the Niger Delta so swamped with oil leaked from eg local 'Robin Hood' plunderers to support natives cf Big Oil, that it has *wrecked the ecosystem for all natives depending on Niger for clean water / fishing

4934 2018-06-22 20:22:27 My dad handed me his friends business card that’s an automotive mechanic and said “here, if nursing school doesn’t work out, call Ken and he’ll let you change the oil” 
4935 2018-06-22 20:22:20 I think throwing that person into the oil spill filled ocean would be a more fitting idea
4936 2018-06-22 20:22:11 He's got plans, Jane! Next he'll be wanting a dedicated beard oil shelf.
4937 2018-06-22 20:22:07 Hell they’re still trying to get rid of Kratom. They’ll go after CBD oil next I’m sure.
4938 2018-06-22 20:22:03 Ok. I actually just got in the mail palmers skin therapy oil which has rosehip in it. Hopefully I like it.

4940 2018-06-22 20:21:39 So I started used Jamaican Black Castor oil in my brows & lashes because I grew up in the era of pencil thin brows. After 2 weeks some of the more sparse areas are filling in why did I not try this sooner

I just soak it with water for the pool, for consideration purposes.
4943 2018-06-22 20:21:30 LIC baba cheerleading every moronic action of Trump - thanks to his idiotic Iran policy, now oil back up above $75 despite a positive OPEC meet. Now a looming trade war threatens to derail our export growth and economic recovery. Aur cheer karo trump ko!!
4944 2018-06-22 20:21:29 gotta put a hot oil treatment on my hair TONIGHT.
4945 2018-06-22 20:21:28 They did an oil change and didn't tighten the skid plate or the drain plug enough. Oil was leaking & the skid plate fell off, but the manager said I couldn't prove it was their fault. I had no clue until I took it to the dealership today.  The manager at Meineke refused to pay.

4957 2018-06-22 20:20:47 why can’t cars automatically fix they damn selves .. oil changes, new tires, shittt full tank a gas , wish my ass had it like Timmy turner
4958 2018-06-22 20:20:41 If that was in houston you would have a guy in waiting to change your oil for a dollar!
4959 2018-06-22 20:20:41 it shouldnt be up that much, sorry if its not popular but we have undone trade wars and no one has even mentioned true affect with sanctions on US imports and ensuing currency wars it will cause - oil prices could be moot by 2019
4960 2018-06-22 20:20:34 They already are making us poorer, two examples of that are the new energy regulator they’re setting up, making NL oil much less attractive to oil companies, and the Feds taking a quarter of our Surf Clam quota, putting less money in the pockets of our fish harvesters.

4961 2018-06-22 20:20:31 I think we are the biggest refiner in the world, but need oil to refine.
4962 2018-06-22 20:20:30 Frankly, every single dime that mama spent on me was never wasted! Even though was wanted, mama was never crude but the oil that her words provided got me lubricated.! Khemikal me I tell you this!
4963 2018-06-22 20:20:26 Too much "weather noise" within grains no?  Oil looking interesting fundamentally ( WTI) - what you think from TA viewpoint?
4964 2018-06-22 20:20:22 I've been drinking pure oil for years. It works a treat!
4965 2018-06-22 20:20:05 OH MY GOD ARE THEY REALLY USING THE KIND OF OIL IM THINKING ABOUT HOLY CRAP
4966 2018-06-22 20:20:01 It's about the illegal oil activities in Niger Delta. The boys are complaining about their joblessness. Appealing to govt to help them so they could refine oil locally.
4967 2018-06-22 20:19:50 Your comment nailed it in one.
We stand by and let the Unionists call everything Scottish shit, then they rob us blind.
What's happened to all the oil money?
4968 2018-06-22 20:19:45 Opec strike deal to increase oil production. Send fuel prices might go down
4969 2018-06-22 20:19:41 What about the culture of @realDonaldTrump legalizing oil spills and locking up children? Why’s everyone silent unless it’s about fucking swag bags and fashion shows
4970 2018-06-22 20:19:39 These oil changes come too soon.

4984 2018-06-22 20:17:49 OPEC just announced 1 billion extra barrels of oil a day. Thanks to Trumps tweet. That will lower prices.
4985 2018-06-22 20:17:49 Those OPEC bastards increased oil barrels by 600k barrels. Crude now at $69 & Brent at $75. Another massive petrol hike on the cards in SA next month

4992 2018-06-22 20:16:45 We MUST abolish all plastic, paper, Styrofoam, wood, inorganic fertilizers, combustion engines, coal, oil and cattle.
4993 2018-06-22 20:16:33 Fill it up and check the oil, please.
4994 2018-06-22 20:16:32 OPEC just said it would add 1 million barrels of oil a day after Trump’s tweet. That will lower gas prices. Best economy, lowest unemployment, ISIS almost completely destroyed, military budget up, lowest unemployment ever for minority’s, tax cuts for 80%, extra bonus for many.
4995 2018-06-22 20:16:28 I’ve started out with just 100% rosehip oil that I had laying around

5002 2018-06-22 20:15:43 Hopefully that is fixed soon. We need energy east and keystone to get done. There are lots of markets for our oil and having those options gives Canada lots of leverage

5012 2018-06-22 20:14:13 If you're paywalled, the answer is cooking it in enough oil. Can confirm; I make popcorn in a saucepan with olive oil 4-5 times a week. 3-4 Tbs of oi oil to a half cup of popcorn kernels (not sure; I eyeball it, but the oil JUST covers the kernels).

5025 2018-06-22 20:12:32 Thank you! I might try it then. It seems relatively inexpensive. I've had breakouts with Neutrogena and Clinique most recently, and it's taken the past six days for a bad reaction to rosehip oil to start to subside, so I think oils are definitively out.
5026 2018-06-22 20:12:24 Yo are y'all watching this on Sky News!??? What?? This Nigerian oil though

5029 2018-06-22 20:11:59 Yep my President got opec to increase oil production.
5030 2018-06-22 20:11:59 Those NYT nutters use an insane amount of oil...& everyone knows nutritional yeast & Old Bay is where the magic's at
5031 2018-06-22 20:11:54 Why are we still dependent on those hooligans? We need energy independence. Then oil prices will really go down!
5032 2018-06-22 20:11:53 I thought we were a net exporter of oil now?
5033 2018-06-22 20:11:46 stopped out in oil?
5034 2018-06-22 20:11:45 I hope if trump puts more tariffs on Canadian products that we reduce our oil and energy we make available to them and ship it elsewhere.
5035 2018-06-22 20:11:39 Are you oblivious to all the harm America has done in other countries? How many regime changes we have supported destabilizing countries, how many wars we have fought for oil or some other self interest?

5040 2018-06-22 20:11:17 Hopefully this helps people realize how important coal and oil are!!
5041 2018-06-22 20:11:08 Which oil cleanser do you use?
5042 2018-06-22 20:11:03 i accidentally got coconut oil in the pasta sauce i was making and it made it like 10x better. im chef
5043 2018-06-22 20:11:03 #Gold put in an up day and #silver outperformed. #Goldstocks decent up day. All good but reality we need to take out 1285 then 1300 to confirm a low otherwise still vulnerable to further declines. #Silver above 16.75. Support 1260 then down to 1240. Big up day for #oil.
5044 2018-06-22 20:10:32 My mum uses wayyyy too much palm oil in her food  I miss my dad’s cooking 
5045 2018-06-22 20:10:31 You may say our system is working bc you still see food. Oil is a diminishing asset and a baggage economy while knowledge economy is powering nations. How do we join them?Bc we have the best resources which is the peoplebut helping one region to catch up have kept us here!
5046 2018-06-22 20:10:27 We use argan oil ONLY for these beautiful locs smh
5047 2018-06-22 20:10:21 I guess you hated Obama because of all his lies, and his snake oil. Would it be offensive to call him a half-black snake oil salesman? Look into it, 45's arresting pedos, forcing corrupt out of Congress, working on trade imbalances, etc. But I'm the one with my head in the sand?

5049 2018-06-22 20:10:01 Last week: Trump says OPEC at it again raising oil prices.
Business Channels: He's crazy,not OPEC it's ...fill in the blank
Today: Chyron on FBN "Oil prices soar as OPEC increase in oil production is smaller than expected"
5050 2018-06-22 20:09:47 Promote eco-tourism, avoid palm oil & avoid buying the beautiful wooden carvings/furniture from Indonesia
5051 2018-06-22 20:09:46 All these come to galatassary people ,them send u come?
5052 2018-06-22 20:09:36 Halo Farm ice Cream Really Oil 
5053 2018-06-22 20:09:19 reminders of why Trump is not my prez; 
-removed all LGBT White House website resources on Day 1 
-appealed the bill that protects the oceans from oil dumping
-is separating children from families with ICE
-tried to ban trans military :)

but lets make america gr8 again, right?
5054 2018-06-22 20:08:48 BREAKING: OPEC countries give in to President Trump's demands, agree to increase oil production by almost 1 million barrels a day - AP
5055 2018-06-22 20:08:46 This couldn't be more obviously a phony product than if he was literally selling a tube of snake oil!
5056 2018-06-22 20:08:45 I love olive oil too, its really good for the hair
5057 2018-06-22 20:08:37 see i use it on everything but my skin. i use it to clean my makeup brushes + wash dishes. try adding a little oil to it like grapeseed or apricot
5058 2018-06-22 20:08:20 Purely for cbd oil for anxiety and other issues
5059 2018-06-22 20:08:20 i put a drop of caster oil into my mascara , it works wonders
5060 2018-06-22 20:08:20 We already have energy independence. OPEC production affects prices worldwide. Our prices can’t go down independently. 
Supply vs. demand for oil is global.

5063 2018-06-22 20:08:11 We get most of our imported oil from Canada.... Trump screwed us over and now gas prices are on the rise. So much "winning", right trumptards?
5064 2018-06-22 20:07:59 Ahaha 
5065 2018-06-22 20:07:58 soda, olive oil
5066 2018-06-22 20:07:52 Quebec Hydro! Certainly. Ontario minerals! Of course. Maritimes/ Territories/ BC off shore oil? Why not!
But any party that attempts that will never be re-elected.
5067 2018-06-22 20:07:35 Wtfff she couldve just applied some oil
5068 2018-06-22 20:07:33 Obama or Clinton did, but Trump complained about windmills, guess he wants to drill for more oil off the east coast.
5069 2018-06-22 20:07:12 Does mapquest own shares in the oil and gas industry bc I drive the unnecessary scenic route far too often.

5071 2018-06-22 20:07:06 There goes Texas produced oil....
5072 2018-06-22 20:07:03 put ice cube over any spots to reduce swelling/redness then use tea-tree oil, crush up aspirin + make a paste to put on them, dab of vinegar/lemon juice on it or a bit of sudocrem/savlon (can dry ur skin out tho so apply sparingly) & don’t use toothpaste Xx
5073 2018-06-22 20:06:57 If you dice up bread into small squares/cubes, drizzle it with some salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and olive oil and then toast it on a baking sheet in the oven, you can make some damn tasty croutons.~:

5075 2018-06-22 20:06:52 oh they#re adding oil alright 
yes, that really is incredible!!! I'm very proud of you for writing so much
5076 2018-06-22 20:06:43 They’re already up, they need to come down. We are an oil exporting nation now, which is keeping the prices of oil higher because our oil is better than the ME.
5077 2018-06-22 20:06:41 My supervisor knew I was stressed, asked if I wanted to smell her essential oil. I kindly declined knowing only cracking a beer could relax me. #ItsFriday #NeedABeer
5078 2018-06-22 20:06:36 ALMOST but not quite because if you research it you will find the US does not lay claim to the resources. It isn't for oil it is for power. Not for the US but for Globalist Elites. Our Government has been controlled and the process is always false flags to eliminate Sovereignty.
5079 2018-06-22 20:06:33 Just about to put homemade chips into the oven, go to put some olive oil on them and obviously I mistook the balsamic vinegar for olive oil didn’t I... #shouldhavegonetospecsaversmate #dontcookblind

5083 2018-06-22 20:05:49 can’t wait to leave the oil changes to my husband
5084 2018-06-22 20:05:49 It all done on purpose so they can steal all the oil in the back when the ppl r busy fighting
5085 2018-06-22 20:05:37 I suppose the big difference is you can only use fuel from oil once. A battery has a 20-25 year lifespan, and after that 95+5 of the materials in the battery can be used again
5086 2018-06-22 20:05:33 Just saw a girl posting 

"Junk food is life" with a juicy burger

It hurts as a Gym Lad, You give up sugars, oil and fat. You break your tissues everyday. You work Hard for months until the CHANGE shows.

But when u look at ur veins in the mirror
Its worth it. Trust me
5087 2018-06-22 20:05:25 Please help me understand how Rwanda is growing at 8 percent a year, even though it has “no oil, natural gas or other major natural resources” and no real industry. I struggle to understand. Please help me understand
5088 2018-06-22 20:05:22 IF YOU CALL THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES A LIAR AGAIN, I AM COMING TO NY AND WASH YOUR MOUTH OUT WITHE LYE SOAP. ALSO, I WILL POUR OIL OF MUSTARD ON YOUR BIPPY.
5089 2018-06-22 20:05:10 Oil can spout
5090 2018-06-22 20:05:03 Stop selling our domestic oil to China. Then we can tell OPEC to go fuck themselves. Then we can work on solar and wind and get off of oil altogether.
5091 2018-06-22 20:04:53 Love the support vibe

Promotes a CBD oil @SabaiDeeCBD 

Its legit. I use it.
5092 2018-06-22 20:04:29 Bought myself oil,acrylic and watercolor paint and a special notepad. 
5093 2018-06-22 20:04:26 Why am I not showing my girls how to change differential oil?!?!
5094 2018-06-22 20:04:14 Damn oil change took forever
5095 2018-06-22 20:04:10 NO, we must PROTECT our beautiful ecosystems and environments. WE don't need anymore damn oil taken out. Read a book about science. Its 2018!
5096 2018-06-22 20:03:59 Three the oil - three the vinegar - three the oil and vinegar....
5097 2018-06-22 20:03:50 We love it so much that we continue to log old growth forest on the west coast and destroy more boreal forest for oil sands projects. As well your gov't hopes to build a pipeline resulting in hundreds more tankers in a wilderness area which will finish off the local orcas.
5098 2018-06-22 20:03:48 Haha my bad I meant “Shit” hole “that” smells like raw oil

5101 2018-06-22 20:03:37 There are people working on making that happen. Just start drilling for oil at Yellowstone.
5102 2018-06-22 20:03:36 This is what i was thinking, gold can be used to create nanotransistors but not for actual commercial transactions or oil for instance a drop of oil is no use but BTC using satoshis can be useful to pay if you operate using the lightning network.
5103 2018-06-22 20:03:35 The oil of every pearl’s uncut cock
5104 2018-06-22 20:03:30 can you add black seed oil and oil of oregano to your juices/shakes or should they be taken by itself?
5105 2018-06-22 20:03:28 15 drops of a hemp oil once or twice per day.
5106 2018-06-22 20:03:12 It's not a matter of sacrifice, it's a matter of new priorities. Oil companies receive massive subsides.  Investing those dollars smarter is where new solutions will be found.

5109 2018-06-22 20:02:29 Yeah. Very temperamental herb, but so very yummy. So tasty as is or in food. Lovely just torn up with chopped tomatoes and cucumber with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and salt and pepper as a salad.

5112 2018-06-22 20:02:03 Why? As a newly independent country we would, legally , have no debt. Lenders would be falling over themselves to lend to us. Backed by strong exports and oil
5113 2018-06-22 20:02:03 I absolutely love how a congressman from Iowa, a state without an international border thinks he should help control the immigration debate. 

Just as good as when Arizona tries to regulate (or lack thereof) offshore oil drilling.

5118 2018-06-22 20:01:30 Happy Friday! Looking to start your weekend off right? We have grams of Jager Oil by Standard going for $20 each. Price is AFTER TAX!!!
5119 2018-06-22 20:01:20 Nah, plus with my hair being black it doesn’t look as oily. I typically go 5-7 days between shampoos all the time so I think my scalp/oil production has adjusted accordingly lol
5120 2018-06-22 20:01:16 The Philippines have nothing of value. The Japanese attacked us because we put a ban on oil exports to them and interfered in places like China. Asian freedom or slavery to Japan was none of our business.
5121 2018-06-22 20:01:15 How long does it takes to rotate tires, change oil and do those extra shit. Seems like I been here all day

5126 2018-06-22 20:00:58 That money goes back into alberta though too. Those provinces take more of the kitty yes but thats taxes. I think it's the biggest non issue people talk about. One day, the oil will dry up entirely (it almost has except for the tar sands) and the flow will come the other. way.
5127 2018-06-22 20:00:55 Did you know that asparagus is extremely good for your heart? 

Grill or steam lightly, then dress with olive oil and lemon. 

It makes for a delicious side dish.and youll get the added benefit of having it go to work for you to neutralize cell-damaging free radicals.
5128 2018-06-22 20:00:40 I sprayed it with a peppermint oil mixture 
5129 2018-06-22 20:00:33 Here I was given the impression that 10% of our GDP was based on resources mainly the world's third largest oil reserves. Oh right I forgot this government is regulating that out of exsistsnce with investment capital leaving by the billions.
5130 2018-06-22 20:00:27 While I realise that oil production is not sustainable, how ethical and how sustainable is mining the materials for high density batteries?
5131 2018-06-22 20:00:11 @realDonaldTrump Can you please get CBD oil passed for consumers, it is unbelievable how much it helps so many different problems.  Also I've heard it helps ease detox symptoms for people that are addicted to Opioids.

5145 2018-06-22 19:58:21 Even if Trump is wrong headed here, your gov't is a bit hypocritical on ocean protection, don't you think? You've killed oil industry off the NW coast of BC but E Coast is  rapidly expanding offshore drilling and oil transport. Answers?
5146 2018-06-22 19:58:15 Immigrants didn't cause the economic collapse. They aren't de-funding our schools or spilling oil into the waterways. They aren't shooting up schools, churches or concerts. They aren't repealing health care or Medicare. That would be white people.
5147 2018-06-22 19:58:03 They fed her cooking oil do help expel them 
5148 2018-06-22 19:58:03 I just went to go get my oil changed & I was panicking and it looked like I had no idea how to work a car & those guys probably thought that I didn’t even have my drivers license 
5149 2018-06-22 19:57:57 Seventy-two.

Or so I'm told.
5150 2018-06-22 19:57:55 Price of oil immediately rose drastically when you pulled out of the Iran deal. Without any plan to replace it. Instability in the region ALWAYS makes oil prices rise. You are responsible.
5151 2018-06-22 19:57:53 Or we could reduce our dependency by giving the same attention to wind and solar and thus drive prices down with competition. But noooo, lets flood the market with more oil from these bloated ass companies.
5152 2018-06-22 19:57:51 OIL IS NOT A MOISTURIZER. IT IS A SEALANT.
5153 2018-06-22 19:57:49 I’m opposed to this entire administration for everything they’ve done the list is long ! Obama protected casts amounts of oceans and made sure Bears Ears was protected Trump Zinke undoing for oil and mining ! Elephants protected ! Obama was a great president! I have lists !

5155 2018-06-22 19:57:38 La pregunta entonces es, en movimiento, los vehículos eléctricos contaminan menos que los que usan "oil"? (Dios mío, se me ha olvidado la palabra española).
5156 2018-06-22 19:57:37 Hey I admit I dont know the Polymet deal. I live in CA. But here’s what I do know. In CA dems say they are for the environment but many have OK’d oil wells in environmentally unsafe areas, or protect fracking. So again, my point is don’t go w/ a label, see if Polymet is dangerous
5157 2018-06-22 19:57:37 Now that oil prices are rising should $TSLA trade as technology stock or car company stock or energy stock?
5158 2018-06-22 19:57:17 Makes good hair gel, after sun, massage oil
5159 2018-06-22 19:57:15 Yes but I honestly don’t have to use much, my hair is soooo thick and coarse it basically soaks up the oil on its own. I have hair where if you put like a serum on it or something it’ll be shiny for 5min then it’ll look like I never put any in, soaks it up lol
5160 2018-06-22 19:57:11 Saudi Arabia is pushing Iran to raise output restrictions at a meeting of OPEC in Vienna after oil prices have reached a level not seen since 2014.

5178 2018-06-22 19:54:44 Outside of Twitter I rave about being friends with THE LADY who handled ARAMCO cyberattack and saved us from oil crisis of the decade  - a total fan  of @SecEvangelism
5179 2018-06-22 19:54:12 @oilfractals @Oil_Tradr 1 - I found something on Pierre Andurand. He is a sneaky snake. There was an article on him back in early 2017. In this article was presented a chart from data from Andurand himself.
5180 2018-06-22 19:54:11 #coeliac people: AVOID #ObanBayFishBar .  I do NOT recommend it to anyone. Their main chef came to yell at me in front of the entire restaurant that I was accusing him of being a liar after I had politely enquired about the gluten free nature of their frying oil.

5182 2018-06-22 19:53:39 I wish I had a queen to apply rose water and oil onto my scalp.
5183 2018-06-22 19:53:37 #WR Analysis: OPEC agreed to increase oil production. @Reuters wrote “OPEC agreed on a modest increase in oil production from next month after its leader Saudi Arabia persuaded arch-rival Iran to cooperate, following calls from major consumers to help reduce the price of crude."
5184 2018-06-22 19:53:37 Yeah, that'll fuck the market completely.  We produce oil here to, last thing we need is another massive price drop again.
5185 2018-06-22 19:53:32 OPEC ministers agree to raise oil production but don't say by how much
5186 2018-06-22 19:53:24 Is the Federal Govrt also going to acquire shops for all other business people in all part on the country? How much money and farm lands has the federal Govrt given to yarm, cassava, palm oil farmers, apart from rich farmers mostly northerners to do their farm business to?
5187 2018-06-22 19:53:19 Well- I called a short on oil around $66 earlier. Glad to say I was done trading by that point. #WTI #oil
5188 2018-06-22 19:53:03 Funny I was given the same model and year to get myself around VT while in law school; I remember the oil pressure could be a bugger from time to time but otherwise solid ride.
5189 2018-06-22 19:53:02 WTF are you building? An oil well?
5190 2018-06-22 19:53:00 Oil and gas are the most efficient and cheapest form of energy we have today. Why are you advocating for forms of energy that are primarily virtue signalling for rich people at the expense of the poor?
5191 2018-06-22 19:52:52 Which is why solar is cheaper right? And no. Oil and coal are inefficient relics and unnecessarily, especially as the climate is growing more unstable and threatens many palces in the world because of pollution and reckless policies caused by greedy people like Trump.
5192 2018-06-22 19:52:32 come on man youre delusional its your last year of high school and your biggest accomplishment is an oil sponsorship pick up a book i dont wanna see you on the streets

5195 2018-06-22 19:52:13 You are wrong. The President is right.  This is going to be a boom for American manufacturing and the middle class. We make steel and aluminum now we just make more. We manufacture cars and car parts again we just make more. List goes on and on. We have lumber,oil,NG. COME ON.

5198 2018-06-22 19:51:51 Do people actually believe that a future administration will put those laws back on ? Like they'll look oil companies in the eyes and say "See, backbone of my economy, I'll just put these things back here and send your profits back to pre-2018"

5200 2018-06-22 19:51:45 @LizClaman  Did u really ask an oil producer if he likes high oil prices?
5201 2018-06-22 19:51:40 Yes!!! Add oil with ur fic XD I'm still so happy over how much I've written ytd, I broke my own record (uni era at least, can't break my own high school era record of 8k a day)

5203 2018-06-22 19:51:23 with the right oil it's a once a year thing. Would normally handle it in my driveway on a pleasant spring day, but I don't know how long it has been since the last change. Don't want to drive it much until I have fresh juice in her. Peace of mind.
5204 2018-06-22 19:51:21 As if Trump was going up against the rich oil companies on behalf of some crawdad fisherman. These people are delusional.
5205 2018-06-22 19:51:16 To hell with OPEC! The US should set their own prices and production with all the oil producers in North and South America.

5218 2018-06-22 19:50:07 Only some parts of PermianBasin. Majority of the shale oil no. If renewal energy and electric cars become reality in next decade all the high cost producers US, Canada Russia etc are bound to fail.

5221 2018-06-22 19:49:42 Hopefully, the "deplorables" (for lack of a better term) will not make the same mistake twice. They will see the gap between the 1% and everyone else has only widened. The $1,000 tax break has now gone into everyone's gas tank making the rich oil companies even more wealthy.

5234 2018-06-22 19:47:49 Mmmmm, I’m generally on your side 99% of the time, but Trump wanted oil prices to come down.  Crude is up 5.5% today (currently).  The increase wasn’t close to what was expected.

5317 2018-06-22 19:38:47 So in short, we were ok being shafted by Harper govt when we had higher provincial revenues due to higher oil & gas royalties? I understand the frustration, and you make good points about resource development. But this is not a good line of attack for UCP under current leadership
5318 2018-06-22 19:38:27  Instagram blows my mind ! I feel basic everyday bro. And that’s how I feel , especially if I oil and wrap well at night

5321 2018-06-22 19:38:07 Lady, you’re driving fast and forgetting to put oil in the car.
5322 2018-06-22 19:37:55 You know what will keep oil prices down? Green energy. I don't really care. Do you?
5323 2018-06-22 19:37:34 True hey the cannabis oil we really need in it works wonders
5324 2018-06-22 19:37:31 Oil = Death
5325 2018-06-22 19:37:25 I, for one, will sleep more soundly tonight. The lack of oil in my oceans has been a problem for me.
5326 2018-06-22 19:37:24 I made a leave-in conditioner that can be used daily. To 32oz of distilled water(in a spray bottle) add 1tbsp each of your favorite conditioner and coconut oil. Hope you find something that works for you, Sis
5327 2018-06-22 19:37:04 Yeah that is a conversation that I would like to have we are supposedly the number one nation of Oil and our gas prices are sky high hell we had cheaper gas prices when we got our oil from the middle east
5328 2018-06-22 19:37:01 Refreshing to know TX is getting into renewables, subsidized or not. In the years I was growing up there, oil & natural gas ruled.
5329 2018-06-22 19:36:58 @RWPUSA if you'd read you would know about all the medical trials that have been going on for awhile that scientifically proven that marijuana given in specific doses eases the pain of opioid withdrawal there's numerous CBD oil that are literally saving lives educate yourself!
5330 2018-06-22 19:36:56 Basically look for the products with tea tree oil, activated charcoal, and the sea salt for exfoliation instead of sugar. Then a softer clay mask for replenishing too- spill the tea and ocean mist are my favorites
5331 2018-06-22 19:36:52 I just bought a cool new pants  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!

5333 2018-06-22 19:36:34 I mean I’ve been had the oil plenty of times. This is maybe the second time I’ve had the actual flower.
5334 2018-06-22 19:36:26 Oil price jumped today on $3.70 to $69.25 per barrel 
Expect much higher prices on gas stations. 

What happened?
5335 2018-06-22 19:36:26 Hey @Valvoline my car has 130,000mi on it, I just want an oil change. Not really interested in spending much on it at this point

5343 2018-06-22 19:35:46 America has an IQ of 50. I’m ok tweeting this as they think I’m talking about oil
5344 2018-06-22 19:35:43 A special thanks to the lady wearing the "There's an oil for that" t-shirt. She sprayed snake oil all over in here and set off my asthma. She said that her poison is hypoallergenic. I said that asthma is not an allergy. We both learned something today. – bij Burger King

5347 2018-06-22 19:35:12 Potable water is the new Oil
5348 2018-06-22 19:35:12 Well that's what con artists and scammers do, and they have done it in every new Enterprise, technology, or market space since the beginning of time. It's important to be diligent with investments and not buy every new snake oil.
5349 2018-06-22 19:35:12 Diz one weak me die..just bcox u see turkey oil .. Meat don fry abi
5350 2018-06-22 19:35:11 Guess we will see if he really has the backs of Canadian workers. He has killed our energy. Paying 4.5 billion out of OUR CPP to let it just sit there. Oil rigs heading south of the boarder. Guess autos are next.
5351 2018-06-22 19:35:00 Don't work as oil on burning fire.. let it be.. if they hav issues they ll resolve.. A leader is there bw both of them.. what u r doing will give words in others mouth nD ppl ll say IK can't handle conflicts within party how ll he handle country nd rest.. don't do that...
5352 2018-06-22 19:34:59 Potable water is the new Oil
5353 2018-06-22 19:34:59 Why don’t we use our products instead of shipping it all out , use American oil
5354 2018-06-22 19:34:57 Why does every truck stop in America think scented pine oil covers up the scent of dirty ass? Now it smells like dirty ass & pine trees
5355 2018-06-22 19:34:55 And also Not good for 90% of the countries pocketbook either with oil prices up today on this half truth news.   Minor Increase has Nothing to do with trump by the way
5356 2018-06-22 19:34:38 Can I put coconut oil on my heart
5357 2018-06-22 19:34:24 Going for an oil change is boring haha. Been waiting for over an hour 
5358 2018-06-22 19:34:16 Fill it up. Check the oil and maybe you'd better catch the windshield also. Thanks man.
Oh, can you tell me if there is an ATM inside?
5359 2018-06-22 19:34:10 really glad Balducci's opened in Reston, the market needed an overpriced Whole Foods and a place where I could infuse my own olive oil for $10 per ounce #bigfatno
5360 2018-06-22 19:34:06 I need a oil change, I need a new rim+tire, a new inspection sticker Oh and the dr said the its an infection causing my arm to be swollen like a bowling pin. Been a great day

5364 2018-06-22 19:33:34 Is this a joke? Do you think trade wars are good for the economy too? To alienate our closest allies and give praise to authoritarian govs like North Korea and Russia? Should oil companies be free to drill wherever they want in the ocean? What policies are you referring to?

5368 2018-06-22 19:32:59 I’ve been putting coconut oil on my lashes for two days now and there’s no difference! I’m suing :/
5369 2018-06-22 19:32:56 •shower daily and apply deodorant 
• apply caster oil and coconut oil to your eyebrows and eyelashes every night to make them thicker 
• apply coconut oil and almond oil on your nails every night 
• drink a glass of lemon water every morning
5370 2018-06-22 19:32:52 my tummy hurts ,& I don’t feel like sitting here getting no damn oil change 
5371 2018-06-22 19:32:51 Is that ok with Putin? He’s loving these higher oil prices ( as if you didn’t know )
5372 2018-06-22 19:32:50 i can design one that will need to visit a gas station once a month and get an oil change every other year.  it will have same acceleration and environmental impact as a Tesla but you will be able to add 400 miles of range to it in 3 minutes at any gas station if needed.
5373 2018-06-22 19:32:46 It’s actually worse than that.  Then they virtue signal about not wanting dirty Alberta oil while dumping raw sewage into the St Lawrence
5374 2018-06-22 19:32:37 I bet he uses beard oil and conditioner. Y’all betta stop, Brody is a sweet boi
5375 2018-06-22 19:32:27 I believe in double standards. 
Don’t forget to give the roses a hot oil treatment tho.
5376 2018-06-22 19:32:23 Today I drove past a small solar farm with a “grasshopper “ oil pump on the same site. Interesting.
5377 2018-06-22 19:32:14 Instead he said chia is a reason why players want to play for the oil. Ugh.
5378 2018-06-22 19:32:12 He didn't vote for him to fix the pipeline, he voted for him because he likes Trumps racism and bigotry. The oil pipeline was just his excuse.
5379 2018-06-22 19:32:06 Bills have been paid

5382 2018-06-22 19:31:44 I'm ashamed to be Australian thanks to snake oil salesman @TurnbullMalcolm you abhor asylum seekers & break humanitarian law. You're for the rich & treat those below the poverty line as bludgers. You further bad policy agendas that harms the most vulnerable. Turnbull=Trump=bigots
5383 2018-06-22 19:31:44 Used a new shampoo that has castor oil in it and I swear to god it’s ruined my hair  no matter how much I wash it I can’t get it out
5384 2018-06-22 19:31:16 Friends from Edmonton had called it the Bakersfield of Canada. Mm. Well oil refineries, pumps and air pollution. I see the similarity.
5385 2018-06-22 19:31:15 Ppl think oil runs the world, drugs, both legal and by prescription runs the world. Opening tbe gates of new alternative medicine, awarness on nutrition, control of gmos and pesticides can help us tremendously and jobs lower crimes, and promote psychological well being
5386 2018-06-22 19:31:04 These evangelistic preachers are the Snake Oil salesman of the 21st century. They live in huge mansions, live the high life and have fat bank accounts. . . probably off shore. They don't pay taxes and one thing is for certain, they are in it for the money.
5387 2018-06-22 19:30:59 I thought about this $$ oil I made years ago the other day then guess what I found when I went through my bag of candles? MY MUTHAFUCKIN MONEYYYYY OIL SMELLIN OH SO POTENT $$$

5394 2018-06-22 19:30:06 the guy oil charged me $30 for an oil change when I usually pay $78, being nice definitely pays off! 
5395 2018-06-22 19:30:05 Foreign cars are all fun & games until you need an oil change or any kind of maintenance

5398 2018-06-22 19:29:50 Oil rose for several weeks until late May and then declined until today when Trump appearantly got his way which seems to be that oil shoots up 5% to the high of the month. Anyone thinking this was another maga moment has no understanding of the situation.
5399 2018-06-22 19:29:48 Coconut oil works wonders for your skin. It’s even my new lip balm, so much better than any moisturizer
5400 2018-06-22 19:29:41 Holdddd on now you didn’t have to run to the oil field n put Chris in “our business”  ..... I see how you would be 
5401 2018-06-22 19:29:40 You could release some reserve to also control  cost manipulation. Why is America not oil independent? also could you explain why oil companies are subsidized ?

But here’s some cause and effect you will understand soon:

5411 2018-06-22 19:29:04 Don’t get your oil changed afterwards.  Car wash and that’s it

5419 2018-06-22 19:28:19 Oooooh you sweet, sweet, sex having people. Don't use massage oil as lubricant. Please. Stop that. It's not made to go inside bodies, and oil is great at trapping bacteria that can cause infections 
#safesex #havebettersex #sexed #plz
5420 2018-06-22 19:28:17 You don’t have to change the oil every 3,000 miles. You can actually wait much longer. Most modern cars can go 7,500 miles or more without fresh oil.

5433 2018-06-22 19:26:22 Meanwhile the US is exporting domestic oil at record rates. You would stand up to the oil companies if you weren’t a corrupt stooge.
5434 2018-06-22 19:26:21 Commercial sequestration is solution, but not necessarily the best.  These still aren’t viable without subsidies.  Why should the tax payer have to subsidize big oil’s pollution?
5435 2018-06-22 19:26:18 Increased production means we’ll run out of oil sooner.
5436 2018-06-22 19:26:04 Yeah agreed. Enjoyed playing this one on the 13th when it had a pop. It could do it again especially with oil rising

5441 2018-06-22 19:25:32 Churchies already hold beliefs that are implausible, based on hearsay, preached with utter conviction by charlatans and snake oil salesmen who profit off of extreme gullibility and fear. Facts have no place in their world...the perfect trump bots

5447 2018-06-22 19:24:46 You are still missing the point ,Scotland in its own rights can’t afford to do its own accounts and taxes (they are done by central England ) so how is it going to manage to join the EU ,we don’t need your gas nor oil and our fish are mostly from the south

5454 2018-06-22 19:23:35 NEW: KCC staff recommend not reopening public comment option for 2,000 oil/gas wastewater wells that received state permits over the past decade. 
The well operators had told locals they get 15 days to protest the wells. (Correct protest period is 30 days.) #ksleg
5455 2018-06-22 19:23:34 Why is it that provinces such as Nova Scotia and Quebec who have chosen to ban fracking and in Quebec's case fought pipelines bringing Western oil receive billions raised from resource development in Western provinces? THIS MUST STOP. #UCP #ableg #cdnpoli #yeg
5456 2018-06-22 19:23:33 Back to oil pulling. The only time I rate coconut oil.
5457 2018-06-22 19:23:28 Selling our natl parks for oil fracking/drilling to foreign countries.
Reversal of all environmental policies.
Taking workers rights away
Doing away with workers safety
Oh, illegally kidnapping children for hostage to build a wall.

5460 2018-06-22 19:23:05 And we had oil which allowed for this and benefited all of Canada. Now we have an anti energy govt and Canada can’t sustain social spending. Tax is too high already as capital leaving...more tax and our erosion accelerates

5465 2018-06-22 19:22:25 $SPY Pros and con on both sides; the bear case most dependent on trade rhetoric and mid-term uncertainty.  All in all, bulls have to happy with gap up today and Oil ripping up.  As well as $IWM and $QQQ working off their overbought  levels.
5466 2018-06-22 19:22:13 As someone who was homeless as a child for about a year, I remember first not having heat because my parents couldn't afford oil, and then they could no longer afford to pay the mortgage, so we lived w/family members and friends and eventually a couple of diff. hotels.
5467 2018-06-22 19:22:11 I’m against meaningless wars and regime overthrows and destabilizing regions yet I’m very strong for our veterans and having a strong defensive military not one that serves as big men for billionaire oil tycoons.

First the world needs their oil, now football. #FIFAWorldCup2018
5477 2018-06-22 19:20:53 Oil prices surged 5% as OPEC agreed a modest increase in output. Of the 1 million bpd hike agreed real increase would be around 770,000 bpd because several countries (like Venezuela) would struggle to reach full quotas.
Good for producers ONGC, OIL & and bad for refiners/OMCs.
5478 2018-06-22 19:20:25 Of course they would rule that way,. Petroleum products are used to make those plastic bags. Less plastic bags = less $$ in the pockets of the oil industry.
5479 2018-06-22 19:20:24 I never said Trump is not the enemy; to me sometimes he does things great like meeting with Kim Jong Un. Sometimes he does something really stupid like repealing Obama's law to protect American jurisdictions of the see from oil spills
5480 2018-06-22 19:20:16 Northwest Iowa is the land of Steve King.

An oil spill is the least toxic thing there.
5481 2018-06-22 19:20:12 What really matters to the market is how many barrels of actual (and not nominal) oil will be added to the market.
5482 2018-06-22 19:20:09 Dare I say, I look and feel like canola oil
5483 2018-06-22 19:20:08 Да, гляну завтра. Вечером все такое было закрыто + ещё один детский магазин проверю, где я в свое время нашла oil pastel мелки, единственные на весь микрорайон.

5491 2018-06-22 19:19:39 Sure, Jan. We know you're a Rosneft guy. You're not fooling anyone. Lower output = higher oil prices = you get a bigger Rosneft cut. You are a con man extraordinaire.

5496 2018-06-22 19:19:17 They use their oil revenue to influence the qualifier games. Whenever they reach World Cup stage they don't even reach semifinals.
5497 2018-06-22 19:19:07 Sometimes, I think it would be nice if a diffuser existed for feelings: I would put drops of feeling into it like essential oil, and they would spread into thin air.
5498 2018-06-22 19:19:06 I haven’t even seen this mentioned. If this Elliot fund grab Milan they’ll sell them anyway. If the Ricketts stuff is true they’ll be fine. 

If they are expecting oil money style spending they in for a horrible shock though.

5500 2018-06-22 19:18:49 You...hope? A real leader doesn't hope, he plans, and acts. You have done nothing to influence OPEC to increase production, just the opposite in fact. Your trade war is destabilizing the global economy and OPEC will keep oil prices high to protect their member countries. Idiot.
5501 2018-06-22 19:18:44 Note the encirclement of India in this strategy. Add the extremely close oil supply ties to Iran, ties to Burmese generals, the new port in Djibouti, projects in Kenya and Mauritius and the full extent of the Chinese stranglehold is clear.
5502 2018-06-22 19:18:42 Why have the oil rag when you could have the engineer? Blair all the way!!
5503 2018-06-22 19:18:40 The oil majors had a pretty good idea that they could pivot away from oil to become broad-based energy companies and survive.  They chose not to do that.  I don't think they have the same room to maneuver as they did in 1980.
5504 2018-06-22 19:18:33 WMs borrowing powers have been bankrolled by North Sea Oil for decades. Utterly false statement.

5508 2018-06-22 19:18:02 And instead of taking it out on the corrupt people in power who used you for an oil grab, then too away the money for your benefits you blame the even poorer brown people trying to seek asylum, okay.

5515 2018-06-22 19:17:06 This is true. OPEC controls the price. Their problem is they need and our companies as well, need oil around 45 bucks a barrel to be profitable. I may be off on that price but close. Why we need other sources of clean energy, get away from fossil fuels.
5516 2018-06-22 19:17:01 Are you daft or something . We need all the money we can get for air- craft carriers & warplanes & bigger bombs . Mi5 & the CIA  need loads of money to do all their dastardly dirty tricks & to assassinate people we don't like . Money for oil spills ? Cop on brother .

5529 2018-06-22 19:16:06 You should get one of those oil mister machines. And start putting lavender oil in it. And take a bath with lavender epsom salt before trying to go to bed. And then drink chamomile.

Seriously, how do you explain it #OOTT ?
5536 2018-06-22 19:15:24 So oil prices have not been on a steady rise? Short term solution?

5550 2018-06-22 19:14:09 Water drops the values and hue of things the shine is more noticable. Latex reflex light but its saturation shifts up the closer to light. And oil reflects and disperses light so you see a rainbow like glow along with a crisp shine from direct light.

5556 2018-06-22 19:13:44 Do some research on the history of equalization. One of the major reasons it was brought in was to keep Quebec happy. Quebec today announced that they're not going to develop their oil & gas resources. Interesting timing! And so hypocritical!
5557 2018-06-22 19:13:38 You keep tweeting about the pipeline that will directly benefit the out of state billionaires that fund your campaign, but you still have not tweeted to call for the reunification of the families that have been torn apart.

5577 2018-06-22 19:10:46 We could have adapted. They preferred destruction. That was the big argument about North sea oil: should it be used to invest or waste. Tories wasted it.
5578 2018-06-22 19:10:44 "The fish farm policy destabilizes investment in B.C. because it creates uncertainty over whether the NDP government might change approval rules for some of the other 60,000 tenure holders on Crown land in sectors such as forestry, mining, oil and gas, and recreational tourism"

5581 2018-06-22 19:10:24 We are at the mercy of OPEC.  Why aren’t we focused on developing renewable energy sources to end our reliance on foreign oil?

5597 2018-06-22 19:08:43 And I thought the USA are independent from the world oil market since years. Why suddenly bother about other countries issues?
5598 2018-06-22 19:08:39 I believe without doubt that within a century, oil would have been cut from more than 50% of its uses

5601 2018-06-22 19:08:18 *looks up how much it would cost to have a mechanic recharge the a/c in his car*

$120-$150? Seriously? The refrigerant costs $10-$20, requires no actual mechanical skill, and takes about 15 minutes to apply. An $30 oil change requires more work than an a/c recharge.
5602 2018-06-22 19:08:17 I would agree that it's worse - but I think it's calculated outrage generation. It gives the Trumpkins something to chortle over, and it sucks up rage that won't get spent on baby prisons, elimination of health care, oil spills, and so on.
5603 2018-06-22 19:08:15 I will type this slowly. 
The worth of a currency is the value others place upon it. If we try to buy oil with a £1million note (freshly printed by BoE) and the owner of said oil says “to me that is worth $2” then we don’t get the oil.

Ive only ever been in contact with it once and any part of me that touched it swelled up BUT it may just have been i was really sensitive because my dogs both had flees real bad and I was very itchy.

5612 2018-06-22 19:07:04 Dan looked as oil.

5691 2018-06-22 18:59:14 We are exporting oil. The world economy is booming partly because ours is. Other countries have increased their demand causing prices to rise. The increased supply will ease the pressure of foreign demand on our domestic market. We already produce more than we use.

5726 2018-06-22 18:54:55 Given that he's been taking stances that destabilize the Middle East, and the Middle East is where we get our gasoline... Yes, I'm saying that he is at least partially responsible. The president doesn't have a lever on his desk that lets him raise or lower oil prices at will, but
5727 2018-06-22 18:54:14 Should I ask this older gent at jiffy lube to pay for my oil change for me???
5728 2018-06-22 18:54:09 Increased corporate demand for the first, global oil prices (futures included) for the second.... In my opinion...
5729 2018-06-22 18:54:01 Who does this benefit?! Nobody but the Oil Companies!!
5730 2018-06-22 18:53:58 Correct. That is not their job. No matter the rhetoric, we all have personal agency. I see it in the same light as global warming. No we're not responsible for the big oil companies who pollute, but can all do our own small part to lessen our own carbon footprint.
5731 2018-06-22 18:53:57 Tea tree oil for me personally
5732 2018-06-22 18:53:54 Its 2018 and people still using that Air Wick shit man. That thing gives me extreme migranes dude. Use essential oil diffusers or anything else for God's sake.
5733 2018-06-22 18:53:48 This body oil has me smelling like cotton candy ..and it's edible too 
5734 2018-06-22 18:53:45 I don't have any rapeSEED oil lol  just vegetable, olive, and coconut oil. I love butter, so I don't stock other things! D:
5735 2018-06-22 18:53:21 Makes oil lines look safe as hell
5736 2018-06-22 18:53:19 You’re as dumb as a bag of broken hammers. Let me guess, you vote democrat. The topic was OPEC. They export oil, not illegal immigrants. That whistling sound is the wind blowing through your ears.
5737 2018-06-22 18:53:18 Except this is not true. OPEC reached a deal with Iran to increase oil production.
Had nothing to do with the US. 
Hopefully this will help out gas prices which have sharply increased in the last 6 months.
5738 2018-06-22 18:53:05 So, you associate with snake oil salesmen?
5739 2018-06-22 18:53:01 ... oil prices to rise in 2019 - tariffs - higher inflation....
5740 2018-06-22 18:52:50 I'm staying at the hotel near lucas oil stadium!

5744 2018-06-22 18:52:22 Running errands by myself feels so good  nails done, car cleaned, oil getting changed now I just need to do laundry and go blow a bag on my lil mama 
5745 2018-06-22 18:52:15 You gave boss Putin what he wanted in higher oil prices by pulling out of Iran deal. Don’t pretend you don’t like it, liar.
5746 2018-06-22 18:52:07 Monia, Oil prices up 3% today - i got it, you want to cheerlead POTUS 
.. market doesn't give a shit
5747 2018-06-22 18:52:03 Lol. It's the faux attention to detail / meticulous snipping at what feels like fresh air and little spray of olive oil sheen at the end. And the scarcely concealed looks of bemusement in the waiting area, checking watches
5748 2018-06-22 18:51:57 BCs offshore oil is on federal water so.  The rest is included unless a special exemption has been granted.
5749 2018-06-22 18:51:57 Leave it to me and we can have $20 per barrel of crude oil LOL
5750 2018-06-22 18:51:52 Yay oil! Screw our future! Winning!
5751 2018-06-22 18:51:42 Coffee may be "essential" but I'm not sure it counts as an "oil" :P #Corked #EssentialOils #WakeUp
5752 2018-06-22 18:51:16 The Saudi's need oil to be at least $85 a barrel to balance their budget. So that's $10 per barrel more than it is right now
5753 2018-06-22 18:51:09 selfies are the WORST. back in MY day you used to go OUTSIDE to your favorite painter's HOUSE and pay exhorbitant amounts of MONEY to them so you could sit for WEEKS on END in your FRILLIEST FROCK to get your heavily edited likeness in OIL PAINTS to hang over your MANTLE.
5754 2018-06-22 18:51:08 summer tip: use coconut oil instead of tanning lotion!! it's all natural and extremely hydrating!!
5755 2018-06-22 18:51:08 So Quebec’s hydro is all included as potential?
BC’s offshore oil can be included as potential?
Ontario’s manufacturing has potential?
5756 2018-06-22 18:51:03 Finally getting my oil Changed. I am sooo long overdue like frfr

5762 2018-06-22 18:50:38 Coconut oil and rosewater are life hacks.
5763 2018-06-22 18:50:35 Bio oil??
5764 2018-06-22 18:50:32 Short version = U cant have 2 diff Gold/oil ratios (1 in USD, 1 in CNY), either explicit or implied.  If CNY oil settles even a little bit in phys gold, that’s a problem for West paper mkts, esp since oil knows they r levered.  GOR can be used by China to influence phys oil flows

5766 2018-06-22 18:50:05 Madrassa chap mentality that cars only run on petrol  and only countries that produce oil are Islamic which believe in nonsensical crap you say 
5767 2018-06-22 18:50:05 The entire civilised world was against that war (Remember Freedom Fries?). Britain (Blair) was the ONLY voice supporting it. He squandered our moral high ground for oil money and votes, same as Bush did. Bush was seen as an idiot. Blair's alliance legitimised him.
5768 2018-06-22 18:50:03 OPEC announced they will increase oil production by one million barrels per day, which will lower gas prices

5782 2018-06-22 18:48:35 @realDonaldTrump is now rationalizing that’s it’s ok to separate 2,500 Families because of the MS-13 murders ??

I had to shut him down. I’ve had it with his Con Jobs. 

Freaking snake oil dripping from his mouth.
5783 2018-06-22 18:48:26 You are doing everything in your power to raise gas prices for big oil. Traitor!!
5784 2018-06-22 18:48:24 Lol. The Harper kept the equalisation formula and even amended it four times to the present arrangement. Mr Kenney voted for it. And yes, the economy was better. There hadn't been a world oil price collapse brought on by the incredible success of fracking. Alberta is fine!
5785 2018-06-22 18:48:23 You can’t leave oil prices to the market @realDonaldTrump. 70-80 is a fair price, otherwise you will have underinvestment in new fields which will sow the seed for the next boom in price and then ultimately bust (because there’s too much capital investment.)
5786 2018-06-22 18:48:20 Joey.....prices are higher because DT pulled out of the Iran Agreement...thus their oil in now not available for the world market....a little reading would be helpful!
5787 2018-06-22 18:48:16 #US has asked #Japan to completely halt #oil #imports from #Iran, going beyond the reductions that were demanded when #sanctions were imposed earlier

5802 2018-06-22 18:46:54 Why are they going? Politicians used to visit with their constituents on holidays, especially the 4th, now?

5814 2018-06-22 18:45:48 Oil prices up, Iran deal very bad, hurts America consumers, very bad policy
5815 2018-06-22 18:45:46 Make sure to keep oil on it. I feel like if I oiled my egdes and sides more than I would’ve been fine

5818 2018-06-22 18:45:41 If any province is trying to block the pipelines they should be cut off of the subsidies,  they don't like Alberta oil, then they don't get the benefits from it. Simple, problem solved.
5819 2018-06-22 18:45:40 Trump is planning on mining minerals out of protected areas, drilling for oil in the ocean. Not to mention polluting the air we breathe
5820 2018-06-22 18:45:39 Oil isn't even to $70 yet... ohhhhh, you were just sending a signal to your OPEC buddies to flood the market... smooth

5827 2018-06-22 18:45:15 OPEC MUST NOT increase production help Trump. Arabic people are Trump's 2nd class US citizens. Oil to reach market price. No help for Trump. He now seeks legitimacy illegal annexation of Arab lands by seeking legitimacy annexation of Crimea. Wants RUSSIA as paradigm for ISR annx
5828 2018-06-22 18:45:11 They should just help us and wash Musa’s leg in anointing oil. He must not walk, run, jump anywhere until after that Argentina match. He must not walk to the bathroom sef

5837 2018-06-22 18:43:44 I realize the areas are entirely different but how ironic that this happens a day after poyus repeals the measures put in place to prevent oil spills in our oceans and lakes.
5838 2018-06-22 18:43:40 I had to put them in one of the empty coffee creamer containers because earwigs were getting into them. Nothing like the bite to eat that bites back. I'm going to have to try the soy sauce and vegetable oil trap to get rid of them. I might leave an opening to catch henchmice also
5839 2018-06-22 18:43:37 Did you ask for synthetic oil or regular? Lol
5840 2018-06-22 18:43:35 Yeah, here people just say rape oil, it's quite common. /Shrug

- Add deli ham or cooked bacon/cooked sausage to cover
- Add slightly undercooked scrambled eggs w/ salt & Pepper
5844 2018-06-22 18:43:18 Going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. Go in needing just a simple oil change come out with everything new under the hood 
5845 2018-06-22 18:43:14 Oil prices up 5% today, despite Trump lame and ineffectual tweets with little impact. OPEC is not listening to Trump.

5850 2018-06-22 18:42:58 In the last few years MANY new finds in both NS and WoS are very very large and the Atlantic Margin is largely unexplored. O&G People have estimated if we exploit the west then there is estimated 100yrs of oil/gas still untapped @ $1 Trillion to the scot economy. That may be ott
5851 2018-06-22 18:42:58 If you haven’t tried the Becca primer I would highly recommend it. I’ve never found a better one for combatting oil. It dries kinda weird on the skin but once you get used to it it’s SO good!
5852 2018-06-22 18:42:41 Lol, until they become over chewed gum and the ass remains the nice puff puff you married, just with a few oil streaks of course 
5853 2018-06-22 18:42:36 I imagine it's rapeSEED oil. :P

5856 2018-06-22 18:42:22 And don't expect American oil companies to support your suggestion. They benefit from the higher prices as well. Why do you think their profits are so high? Because they're more efficient? Nope. Just piggybacking on international prices.
5857 2018-06-22 18:42:21 Some jars are a pain to open. Reason why I bought one of those jar opener devices with the rubber strap and handle. I even use it to remove the oil filter to my truck.
It's good to vent frustration though so you're fine. (^-^)

5860 2018-06-22 18:42:03 25. In the case of statutory transfers where the increase in the @nassnigeria budget was isolated, it is important to note that the increase in the oil price benchmark from the projected $45 to the actual price of $51 generated additional N523.65 billion for the Federal Govt.
5861 2018-06-22 18:42:02 Indeed, likely an oil spill that caught fire
5862 2018-06-22 18:41:50 Wow. It’s a good thing @EPAScottPruitt repealed all those safety regulations for deep water drilling. 

Will these oil companies share that information with the population?

5864 2018-06-22 18:41:44 I wish I had taken that auto class in high school so I could do simple shit for my car like oil changes and taking off a tire
5865 2018-06-22 18:41:40 It matters because when Michelle Obama went to view an oil spill and she wore a tank to the GOP had an absolute fit. So if Michelle can't wear a tank top Melania can't wear a jacket that says "I really don't care do u".
5866 2018-06-22 18:41:34 Wow, all we have to do is put pressure on the oil producing cartel, and it will lower prices???  Wow, why hasn't anyone thought of that in the last 40 years.  I'm sure OPEC will be shocked to learn that they are charging too much, we might even get refund checks in the mail.

5871 2018-06-22 18:41:17 I think we can do it, but its gonna take a lot of growing pains. Hopefully we can fill our spare time with local colleges that can teach us these basic habits. We can all know how to change the oil on our own cars(until they no longer need oil).
5872 2018-06-22 18:41:15 Love it: “Remember when Michelle Obama showed her bare arms and went to an oil spill, and Fox News went nuts? I’m sure they’ll have the same reaction to this.” — JIMMY KIMMEL
5873 2018-06-22 18:41:15 Yup. And just as you said that...a tanker carrying crude oil derails....spilling its contents....good job.
5874 2018-06-22 18:41:11 Lavender. I love infusing it into olive oil and adding the oil to recipes.

5881 2018-06-22 18:40:30 My point was - back in 2014 we were lied to by the BetterTogether side in cahoots with Sir Ian Wood... obviously because if they could lead people to believe that the oil industry was on its last legs then the economic arguement for indy was less stable.

5894 2018-06-22 18:39:44 Please, the fuel prices are going up because we bailed on the Iran agreement so now their oil is not available for the world market so....the prices go up...dump decisions lead to poor results...just sayin!

5900 2018-06-22 18:39:30 tell our greedy oil companies to raise output. They continue to want more land and prospects but every time the price drops they shut down. They don't want to produce more they want it to fall on OPEC to keep them in the sweet spot #FactsMatter

Does a morning shot of coconut oil or fish oil (I.e. 100% fat) count against a 16:8 fasting schedule?

Doesn’t affect blood sugar and as I understand it, fat is the easiest macro to digest.

5920 2018-06-22 18:37:29 They were & I guess still are with global pricing. They just can't get away with an oil embargo as they did in the 70's. It's just the fact we are not dependent on them for oil. Thus, when they increase production the price drops. It's not quite that simple, but the general idea
5921 2018-06-22 18:37:22 I use rape oil, it has no flavour!
5922 2018-06-22 18:37:16 In 2015 Barack Obama lifted a 40 year ban on exports to China,  last March,  the U S exported 18.4 million barrels of crude oil and oil products.

5928 2018-06-22 18:37:04 Why did they take the oil spill money from the coast? It could have paid for this.  Oh right. They need that money in the northern part of Alabama even though it was the coast that was hit.

5930 2018-06-22 18:36:54 Or...we could be come energy independent with renewable energy that doesn't pollute the air and water we need to live. We could create thousands of jobs and improve the planet. Or we can stick to fossil fuels like the luddites who said Whale oil was the only way to go.
5931 2018-06-22 18:36:52 You always come back to the team in front of him, but don’t give any positives as to why you think he’s better than he is. Partially because their really aren’t many.

5973 2018-06-22 18:32:26 How does the oil price go up the day it’s decided to increase production?? Sounds like the speculators are driving the prices up again. The price of diesel fuel is way to high as is gas.

5981 2018-06-22 18:31:59 •Soak a cotton swab in pure castor oil and apply it on each eyebrow.
•Massage for 2 to 3 minutes.

•Wash it off with lukewarm water and a mild cleanser.
•Repeat once daily for a few weeks until you notice improvement.

6007 2018-06-22 18:29:33 Tiba2 kepo sama kleveru trus pengen nyobain, tp masi ragu2 krn ini oil...
6008 2018-06-22 18:29:31 How is this tweet aging. Oil prices surged 5% today. Way to go Dotard
6009 2018-06-22 18:29:23 So what is more humane, putting them in a live trap where they will go unnoticed and die or trapping them and using vegetable oil to loosen it and letting them go? In forms Of TRAPS for rodents they are the most humane at this point.
6010 2018-06-22 18:29:20 Canada has oil and isn't a member of opec...
6011 2018-06-22 18:29:04 They are already in Denmark.  Anyway, given the size of our water and renewable energy resource we should be building fuel cells & electrolysers in Scotland.  Otherwise it will end up like oil & gas with every other bugger exploiting our resources with us getting the table crumbs
6012 2018-06-22 18:28:57 I know math is hard for you but the price of oil and gas are at the same price as when your government was in power.
6013 2018-06-22 18:28:49 Gotta do my homework and they taking forever to change my oil
6014 2018-06-22 18:28:40 そうですよねぇ…この時間帯の鳥っていうのが珍しくて思わず3度見してわざわざ車で引き返して見てきましたw
6015 2018-06-22 18:28:37 Uncalled for 
6016 2018-06-22 18:28:28 Just organic virgin coconut oil
6017 2018-06-22 18:28:27 Oil which continues to be crucial to the world and it's economy, has always fascinated me. My love affair with those around the world who control it has been hidden for years.  Who knew that some of the most powerful people in the world loved Charlie Brown so much?
6018 2018-06-22 18:28:23 Anybody take black seed oil?
6019 2018-06-22 18:28:18 ya president Trump I can't see Canada putting down the price of oil anytime soon
6020 2018-06-22 18:28:13 as minhas maçãs do rosto estão ficando mais altas por causa do oil pulling todo dia isso é o que eu mereço
6021 2018-06-22 18:28:13 Hey @OlivMooseJaw thanks for some great memories of shopping in your store but also, thanks for giving me an obsession: dill olive oil and jalapeño lime balsamic vinegar! Makes this salad super good. (Like, regular good, but with a cape!)
6022 2018-06-22 18:28:08 Ha! I think he has too. Jeff “The Turtle” Sessions is back in his shell.
Now Tom, as we know has a caffeine problem. Or as Hollywood calls it, an oil sump leak. Tommy boy has pure laboratory grade Colombian gold. Smuggled inside a mule’s A** by his new friends MS-13...
6023 2018-06-22 18:27:47 And honestly, the problem just wasn't this bad at the time. This all really started to pickup around the same time as the oil & gas boom. That's the first I heard new stories about people dying from injecting the gel from fentanyl patches. Over about a decade the area has tanked.
6024 2018-06-22 18:27:38 4.Olive Oil

Olive oil is also good for your eyebrows. Being rich in vitamin E, olive oil can help your eyebrow hair grow faster and thicker. It will also help keep it dark-hued.
6025 2018-06-22 18:27:36 $DAL OPEC will pump more, oil spikes 5% on the news - Whaaa?! down goes DAL . Airports are packed , another record setting travel season...
6026 2018-06-22 18:27:30 What if you had enough tankers with nothing to do and oil to sell? That if global didn't matter and by using one storage area you could change global perception of supply and demand? Seems like an easy move to accumulate some collateral while you're at it.
6027 2018-06-22 18:27:25 What will happen to oil now?
6028 2018-06-22 18:27:17 Getting my oil changed for the first time in forever 
6029 2018-06-22 18:27:16 Two rules about oil:
1) Oil is the most manipulated market there is
2) OPEC always lies and cheats

Supply up.
Normal mkt reaction: price down
Oil: price up

Story is market expected bigger increase. See two rules above.
6030 2018-06-22 18:27:06 Why not streamline use of oil from Texas, Dakotas, Alaska, and make OPEC’s effect negligible? The “Seven Sisters” can get in the new dance or go home single.
6031 2018-06-22 18:27:06 Tere naam ka ek hi pun banta hai. But if I would do that, that would be Harsh. Waise ek baat bata, tu kadai mein paani kyu daala? Tujhe bola tha pakode oil Mittal?
6032 2018-06-22 18:27:00 What kind of beard oil do you use? I get gibs and love it
6033 2018-06-22 18:27:00 I believe the fourth period like I believe Eklund and his jiberesh. That said, I could see him being shopped at the deadline if the Oil are out of the playoffs
6034 2018-06-22 18:26:51 if you are a christian country trading with an islamic oil rich country and want to gain their trust surely its obvious to have a percentage of muslims within the christian country and when the oil runs dry and you are no longer trading what happens to the muslims, tommy robinson
6035 2018-06-22 18:26:42 Why discuss oil production when we can discuss Melania's jacket?
6036 2018-06-22 18:26:40 Just made some kick ass Korean inspired scrabbled eggs. Minus brown the brown sugar. It was hella good. I enjoy the mixture of sesame seed oil and ginger mixed with eggs.

6039 2018-06-22 18:26:27 @ThatBoyAmro I guarantee you, the Ricketts will manage us like Arsenal. Trying to make Ac Milan profitable before making any investment, with the only and huge difference that Serie A doesn’t pay as much as EPL.
Oil&Gas money the only solution.
6040 2018-06-22 18:26:11 元気？
6041 2018-06-22 18:26:08 •Massage your eyebrows with warm olive oil for 5 minutes before going to bed.
•Leave it on overnight, then rinse it off with warm water the next morning.
6042 2018-06-22 18:25:51 Full tank of gas, fixed the slow leak in my tire, and now I’m getting an oil change/carwash

6045 2018-06-22 18:25:11 I bought a pizza not only was it swimming in oil but it tasted like washing up liquid 
6046 2018-06-22 18:25:06 Do your sums, preferable without checking on google beforehand.

Norway has vast reserves of Natural Gas with a population of about 4M & we’ve just used up significant reserves of North Sea Oil already with a population of 65M.

It’s not difficult, unless you can’t add that is.
6047 2018-06-22 18:24:57 I just read to mix nut milk with oil 
6048 2018-06-22 18:24:45 Per @Bob_Stauffer , "Never say never but 99.9% sure that goalies next year are Talbot and Koskinen". on Oilers now
6049 2018-06-22 18:24:44 Could you Albertan's be any whinier? When oil is high you whine. When oil is low you whine. The rest of the country doesn't treat us right. We are so hard done by. 
6050 2018-06-22 18:24:36 Personal and Business like Oil and Water.... you get it...
6051 2018-06-22 18:24:34 Oil food s main reason
6052 2018-06-22 18:24:32 Do wereally need oil from opec?
6053 2018-06-22 18:24:29 All Trader Joe's items for this "stir fry" recipe: 
- one box of fully cooked pork belly
- a bag of cruciferous crunch veggies
- lots of soy sauce, garlic
heat up oil in pan, slice and brown the pork first before adding veg+sauce. cook until veggies are wilted. lasts a few days!
6054 2018-06-22 18:24:27 Maintain your vehicles in good condition. Give your car a regular servicing. Clean the exhaust pipes. Check for pollutants emitted. Check air pressure in tires, Maintain the air filter and fuel injection pump in good condition. Check engine oil levels regularly. #GoGreenBox
6055 2018-06-22 18:24:26 my dad told me that he is gonna make me give my oil guy the check when we get oil for the house. please pray for me that I dont fall and make a fool of myself 
6056 2018-06-22 18:24:21 So you don't want European steel or cars but you do expect cheap oil from OPEC? Ever heard of Oliver Twist sir?
6057 2018-06-22 18:24:13 Obeah oil tun up

6062 2018-06-22 18:23:36 Why did he repeal the order that protects oceans from oil spills I'm so confused as to what benefit it would bring
6063 2018-06-22 18:23:34 Yemen oil is fast running out. No one would fight a war for it. Saudi has vastly more oil already.
6064 2018-06-22 18:23:25 Trumps been tweeting about oil prices for a while now. 
6065 2018-06-22 18:23:25 And let's try not to kill what's left with oil spills.

6070 2018-06-22 18:23:15 This was funny. Bob just shut t down on oilers now. It makes no sense for oil
6071 2018-06-22 18:22:58 I need an oil change
6072 2018-06-22 18:22:55 Allah ya ganar dakai yadda ake minding business.
6073 2018-06-22 18:22:52 Classic 
6074 2018-06-22 18:22:43 Please do, also you can payback the oil revenues you have pilfered from Scotland.
6075 2018-06-22 18:22:42 Why would they? Oil prices are as high as they are is because OPEC doesn't care, and never has, about how much Americans pay for gasoline. They raised prices in 1973, and have kept them high ever since because of our support for Israel. You don't know shit about history, do you.
6076 2018-06-22 18:22:39 Really wanna try beard oil to see what the buzz is about but I'm also completely broke.  
6077 2018-06-22 18:22:31 Tax cuts not helping?

6084 2018-06-22 18:21:55 Grooming, shaving and putting beard oil on is really the guy version of girls using them lush bath thingys and moisturizering lmfaoooo
6085 2018-06-22 18:21:49 Not to mention that a substantial portion of Trump's base benefits from high oil prices.
6086 2018-06-22 18:21:42 About a week into oil pulling and must say, feeling great and teeth are looking and feeling great already. 
6087 2018-06-22 18:21:34 The flame was up too high... if you're gonna cook chicken it's actually better to use a cast iron pan with a little bit of water to keep the chicken from getting dry. Oil is used for fried chicken and as long as the pans not to hot you should be ok.
6088 2018-06-22 18:21:32 that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil 
6089 2018-06-22 18:21:23 Para ellos es la solución más rápida y de está forma acaba con todos los CC y más gente desempleada. Para suministrarle gas oil piden una infinidad de requisitos y los consumos van a ser elevados ya que son 11 hrs. @CorpoelecZulia_
6090 2018-06-22 18:21:17 @realDonaldTrump PLEASE DONT ALLOW OIL SPILLS INTO THE OCEAN ARE YOU FUCKING STUPID
6091 2018-06-22 18:21:12 Trump just got OPEC to increase their oil production by a million barrels a day to keep your gas/oil product's costs down.
6092 2018-06-22 18:21:08 Sitting in the dealership (the one my brother works at) getting the oil changed on my car, and I hear my brother singing/screaming to Celine Dion's "My heart will go on"! I'm sooo trying not to bust out laughing!
6093 2018-06-22 18:21:02 Or maybe cause we spend 10 billion dollars a day and protecting the Gulf of Mexico from oil spills helped put a big dent in our economy when countries such as Mexico don’t really do shit about it.
6094 2018-06-22 18:20:54 The stock market is up today because --- oil and gas prices are rising some more. All this winning!
6095 2018-06-22 18:20:45 Front month spreads in #WTI are implying a mass shortage is underway in #oil...which is absolutely false. These spreads are already contracting today from their highs and should continue to do so

#oott #OPEC
6096 2018-06-22 18:20:44 “Drive down oil prices with a push of a button.” How can people be this dumb, I’d expect that from Eric. Btw 1M barrels collectively really isn’t a lot. It won’t drive down gas prices which are significantly higher than under Obama. Thanks Trump!
6097 2018-06-22 18:20:34 @RussoHockey Crazy wild trade idea for your chat:  Brodin to oil for the 10 pick- Nino-Coyle-10 pick to CBj for the bread man...
6098 2018-06-22 18:20:34 Bet you that 2.5 Trillion dollars year The land of rain is receiving 13.5 Trillion years oil and gas production
6099 2018-06-22 18:20:34 Oil and gas industry receives $3B in direct subsidies and down stream costs are $46B annually. AB may actually owe more.
6100 2018-06-22 18:20:16 Thank you Beth
6101 2018-06-22 18:20:13 You're mad
6102 2018-06-22 18:20:11 Trumps trying to get OPEC to produce more because he’s trying to screw Canada since 40% of US imported oil is from Canada.   He knows Canada has strength in tariff war he started. It’s never about US....it’s always about covering his screw ups or making money for himself
6103 2018-06-22 18:20:11 あ、あー。読者の皆さんにお任せしさます的な要素含まれてる感じですかね?
なんか腑に落ちないわけだ
6104 2018-06-22 18:19:59 If I had the skills I'd prolly be working on an oil rig. I hear they make buttloads of money and the satisfaction of more directly killing the world appeals to me
6105 2018-06-22 18:19:49 why is oregano oil so strong omg
6106 2018-06-22 18:19:49 Iran pushing through Syria, into Turkey, then on to Europe. Cut off the flow of gas and oil. Activate all European sleeper cells, not that they need to hide from the EU to begin with. Then, conquer.
6107 2018-06-22 18:19:45 Not necessarily. I went to a public school. My Dad was a radio operator on oil tankers & my Mum a housewife. Not rich. We never had a car! Also, there were kids in my school who should have been in prison, same as any other school. School day was 8-6, six days per week not 8-3.
6108 2018-06-22 18:19:32 How does Fifi oil her self up?
6109 2018-06-22 18:19:23 castor oil and jojoba oil saved me!
6110 2018-06-22 18:19:20 Thought today was Saturday.  So my whole day was shot.  Missed the boat.  No trading on a great day for oil, Ugh. It happens.
6111 2018-06-22 18:19:13 what kind of coconut oil
6112 2018-06-22 18:18:59 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
6113 2018-06-22 18:18:48 Castor oil rub it on them
6114 2018-06-22 18:18:47 Too late. You’re not intelligent at all. I’ll bet a 1st grader has trump pegged as a snake oil salesman. I feel sorry for the way he’s using you.

6118 2018-06-22 18:17:57 Guess who’s going out with ashy legs and not worried about it? I don’t have sunblock and I am most definitely not putting baby oil on and then going in the sun.
6119 2018-06-22 18:17:54 I sipped some oil early this morning this shit on my ass right now
6120 2018-06-22 18:17:48 He is the Wizard of Oz. The emperor has no clothes.  He is a snake oil salesmen.  He is the music man.  He is a grifter.  He is full of shit.  It’s all abracadabra and jazz hands.  He is just awful.
6121 2018-06-22 18:17:22 Uhhh hard to not bite the nails when theres nothing to do. Also plz plz lemme be motivated enough when i get off work to change my oil and cut some material for another carpentry project. Gotta keep pushing forward...
6122 2018-06-22 18:17:21 Hi Diane, we have gluten-free Dough Balls (that can be served with garlic oil) and gluten-free pizzas with dairy-free mozzarella available and they can be part of our set menu offer.
6123 2018-06-22 18:17:20 Recipes calling for 1 tsp of coconut oil might as well be calling for 5 whole frickin coconuts wtf
6124 2018-06-22 18:16:58 40% of US oil Imports come from Canada not OPEC also Mexico and Venezuela.
6125 2018-06-22 18:16:55 Corporate judges on the Texas Supreme Court ruled today that cities can't ban retailers from offering single-use plastic or paper bags. Apparently, they are being funded by Big Oil and the plastics industry. This is why we don't elect Republicans or Corporate Democrats.
6126 2018-06-22 18:16:52 dont mind my hair stories on ig i just put argan oil in it and it turned out wavy so i got a little vain
6127 2018-06-22 18:16:46 The Fox woman obviously does not know what the lawsuit was about.  Seismic is a tool used by geologists to determine the location of oil and gas.  Drilling is the actual process of proving whether the seismic interpretation was correct.
6128 2018-06-22 18:16:46 After my oil change, the dude said "you're due back in September."

Right.

See you in 3 weeks.
6129 2018-06-22 18:16:39 This is on 45. And only 45. You dont have to like it but this is on him on his watch.   Where were you during Puerto Rico and Hurricane Maria?  We are in a new hurricane season and 45 does nothing. He doesnt care. If PR struck oil tomorrow he might but now he and cronies dont GAF
6130 2018-06-22 18:16:32 Here's how that's going: big oil companies, right-wing extremist groups, and US sanctions are putting the country in crisis.
6131 2018-06-22 18:16:30 Bout to use baby oil in the shower, tryna see sum real quick  pray for me
6132 2018-06-22 18:16:28 I hate when the dealership calls me to do a survey after a oil change. Good thing I never activated my Voice Mailbox. #annoying 
6133 2018-06-22 18:16:26 But low oil prices make it uneconomical to produce oil in the USA - The Saudi's pushed for high production and thus lower prices to basically make American Shale Oil uneconomic... maybe you need to think about that next time you're talking to them.
6134 2018-06-22 18:16:22 took a fish oil pill because my eye doctor made me going  to die tbh
6135 2018-06-22 18:16:09 If you had a more positive view on Muslims, OPEC wouldn't cut down on production. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out they passed a law last year forcing Oil Companies from producing too much oil. And expand their reserves.
6136 2018-06-22 18:16:01 Oil filter
6137 2018-06-22 18:15:54 気合入れてあげるしかないですね
6138 2018-06-22 18:15:53 they can't afford good sandwiches with oil under $300
6139 2018-06-22 18:15:52 40% of your oil imports come from Canada 
6140 2018-06-22 18:15:51 It happens because the people it will benefit, the oil people, are paying him.
6141 2018-06-22 18:15:46 Mix 1 cup chef with 1/3 cup English muffins. Mix into  Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve on a bed of pasta
6142 2018-06-22 18:15:40 THIS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR MARIJUANA ENTHUSIASTS & FOOD ENTHISIASTS

SO GOOD. MUST WATCH. 10/10
6143 2018-06-22 18:15:37 Just spent $60 on an oil change. I hate adulting.
6144 2018-06-22 18:15:24 Done! That’s easy. We can oil up and then all the penises and clits will explode.
6145 2018-06-22 18:15:20 WOW, you don't know much about the world do you Don?

There are a number of reasons that the oil producing nations got together, probably above your intelligence, BUT;

they MOST CERTAINLY DIDN'T COME TOGETHER TO GIVE AMERICA CHEAP PETROL!

You intellectual infant, please RESIGN
6146 2018-06-22 18:15:12 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
6147 2018-06-22 18:15:08 what US oil???
6148 2018-06-22 18:15:03 But I need that oil change so I can take that drive to nowhere land ! #endoftheroad
6149 2018-06-22 18:15:02 Oil is dead.  You are so 18th Century.  You will also NEVER be an elite.  You will always want to crash the party and none wants you there.  That’s why your A-list is Scott Baio and Clint Empty Chair.
6150 2018-06-22 18:14:55 Know what else he signed?  An EO allowing for oil drilling which will ruin our oceans.  It would seem a Vets memorial is more important than that or #TrumpCamps to you though.  Maybe we can have a #townhall to discuss your priorities?
6151 2018-06-22 18:14:52 OIL UP AGAIN>> HAHAHA  great have fun shore driving..
6152 2018-06-22 18:14:48 Haha read that wrong,  i thought you put u flipped your top off ready for the baby oil 
6153 2018-06-22 18:14:35 washed, deep conditioned, & did a hot oil treatment to my hair & it feels so much better 
6154 2018-06-22 18:14:33 Well sh*t you mean cancelling the Iran deal and putting sanctions back on them, causes the price of oil to be more volitile? Who saw that coming? <hint - everyone>

Thankfully we have all that clean beautiful coal 
6155 2018-06-22 18:14:25 Because of Trump, oil production here in the United States has increased substantially. If you don't think that makes a difference in his having OPEC'S attention ,  you don't understand President Trump's motto, "Non ducor, duco."
6156 2018-06-22 18:14:23 You know there isn't all that much oil left right?
6157 2018-06-22 18:14:20 @Jordo311 this reminded me of you I’ll slather you in sunscreen and myself in tanning oil(;

6159 2018-06-22 18:14:18 You know what would’ve kept oil prices down? Staying in the Iranian Nuke deal. It would’ve kept America safer, as well. But when our President is a feckless dotard, & second-rate com man, we all pay the price.

6160 2018-06-22 18:14:18 How can they call this an advantage express oil change ? Already been here an hour and a half , last time it was 3 hours , I would hate to see it if it was express
6161 2018-06-22 18:14:11 If you like a lot of mustard oil on your strudel, join our club!
6162 2018-06-22 18:14:10 Maybe instead of isolating oil producer Iran try talking to them their oil would have helped keep supply up and the price down.
6163 2018-06-22 18:14:05 To neatly round out the trip, we discover 1.5 hours before we have to leave for the airport that we have a flat tyre and the car is leaking oil. Turns out the puncture is slow enough that we reckon we can make it to the airport, and the leak was just water. #travelpocalypse2018
6164 2018-06-22 18:13:58 How low oil price & FR$ (!=US$) index would’ve gone if that additional supply hit market+sold outside of FR$? hence those countries decimated;pharaohs servant OPEC+mega oil giants(richer than many countries)didnt mind false wars 2remove competition 2keep oil price up-artificially

6167 2018-06-22 18:13:21 I remember (12 yrs) as a kid living in Fort Saskatchewan, meeting an ex Nazi. He complained about losing the war because of the lack of oil for the military. My Mom survived occupied Denmark during the war - too many stories - so meeting this man was scary!!
6168 2018-06-22 18:13:19 Conservatives in this province had 45 years to get our workforce off the oil industry's teat. A small oil recession did far more damage than it should have. That's on the Conservatives. Now we have the disastrous, alt-right UCP waiting in the wings. NO THANKS!!
6169 2018-06-22 18:13:13 That one you have just needs some oil. All squeaky and shit. Sounds like an old ass barn door.

6174 2018-06-22 18:13:02 Thanks Beth.
6175 2018-06-22 18:12:56 Sounds to me like the observed front-end spike is more a side-effect of whatever is causing the QU blowout on WTI. Hard for me to see how Brent-WTI action could be the driver causing QU blowout, since the physical oil owners are passing on the arb it creates.
6176 2018-06-22 18:12:44 I like to think that dog is a very important oil tycoon who had this commissioned for his big corner office
6177 2018-06-22 18:12:35 Dow set to snap 8-day losing run as oil climbs
6178 2018-06-22 18:12:33 Life is worse than before; used to save $50/mo. But now, short of cash with less things being bought with $0.50/hr increase due to the so much increase from: gas to food to house rent to almost all commodities that depend on price hike of oil & its derivatives???
6179 2018-06-22 18:12:16 Because oil companies sell crude, generally, not ethanol, so there is no incentive for them to sell 5 or 10% less of their product
6180 2018-06-22 18:12:15 @TroKalayjian Tro, sorry to be a pain, but I'm making a LC cauliflower/parmesan crust pizza.  It says to spray the parchment paper.  I threw away all the vegetable oil Pam sprays.  What do you think about coconut spray, fat-free mozzarella, and turkey pepperoni?  Thanks!

6184 2018-06-22 18:11:53 This will not help out the oil industry in this coutry. On the bright side there will be fewer wells drilled in inappropriate places.

6186 2018-06-22 18:11:38 Of course, oil prices spiked when you canned the Iran deal. Tillerson was too kind.
6187 2018-06-22 18:11:35 I salute you for that girl, but changing oil and tires isn't the same as restoring classic cars all summer & having to rebuild transmissions, sanding, etc, I'm just gonna ruin them trust mee

6191 2018-06-22 18:11:10 oooh! It's so good! And not that complicated to make! You can make a batch of pesto paste (becomes sauce when you add olive oil or butter) and keep it in the fridge for a week or freeze it.

6216 2018-06-22 18:09:24 As for “better economic policy”, that’s exactly what they’ve done by focusing on diversifying as opposed to praying the price of oil goes back up. That diversification is a legacy your kids will be thankful for. #ableg

6220 2018-06-22 18:09:13 OPEC is a cartel rigging the international price of oil. They are screwing ordinary folk in the US and the President sits back and let's it happen.

6222 2018-06-22 18:09:05 Sounds like a terminology problem. I've tried to slide using my keyboard on my computer, and my cell phone, but the oil always messes it up and I'm on my fourth keyboard. Maybe just type with no lube?

6225 2018-06-22 18:08:49 You are a MORON just like your father. Crude oil is up almost 5% right now. Do you know what that means, it means the price of gas goes up. Now instead of a .20 cent hike for the 4th July week it will go 40-50 cent hike.

So yes you Dad should not Tweeting stuff like this.
6226 2018-06-22 18:08:48 But wait you said we had plenty of oil in our country. Again more lies.

6287 2018-06-22 18:03:02 OPEC has no idea what to do with US oil production. That's why they have to play the jawbone game. So they will pump like crazy, but tell the mediocre cute stories like "spare capacity" and "it's only 600k rise" baloney to only get away with pumping.
6288 2018-06-22 18:03:01 And 800M upgrade of Sullem Voe for all the extra fields... Back in 2014 most Oil workers knew WoS was massive - it was the media that kept it under wraps... the last 4 yrs has amply demonstrated that, plus other Huge finds in NS too. Sir Ian lied thro his auld tory teeth.
6289 2018-06-22 18:02:45 I can't have soybean oil anymore and because most mass produced mayonnaise out there is made with soybean oil... )': i cant have mayo....
6290 2018-06-22 18:02:43 I witnessed the devastation caused by the Exxon oil spill in Alaska. Oil companies are NOT the victims. Thousands/millions of animals, fisheries, fishermen, the environment, & the American people are & will continue to be the victims of these disasters thanks to Trump rollbacks.
6291 2018-06-22 18:02:41 There is a herbal oil with ingredients from our outdoors garden on it. Makes it extra delicious!
6292 2018-06-22 18:02:41 I defo have tanorexia  feel pale as fuck yet been tanning all day with coconut oil on 
6293 2018-06-22 18:02:40 Goodness a $20 oil change can cost you $300 if you’re not careful. Thankfully I’m cheap and don’t (usually) fall victim to upselling.
6294 2018-06-22 18:02:40 @foundmyfitness I saw that you made a distinction in Omega 3 from marine sources. Is that to say there is less benefit from plant source Omega 3 like from Hemp oil? Thanks for all you do.
6295 2018-06-22 18:02:33 I gotta check with Bannon but I wonder if I can sell the strategic oil reserve to the Japanese. I'll get a good price!
6296 2018-06-22 18:02:25 A bit of face friendly oil {I use avacado but some use coconut) to get the stubborn make up off, them wipe it all down with a face wipe or cleansing water. No scrubbing required!

6299 2018-06-22 18:02:14 We need to invest in renewables. Why are you keeping us dependent on foreign oil and fossil fuels? You think can run your space force on coal?
6300 2018-06-22 18:02:12 I didn’t know there was so much more to maintaining your than just getting oil changes 
6301 2018-06-22 18:02:10 The fake news media makes you obvious to how much good trump is doing - one tweet he makes about oil prices and opec says they are lowering prices lol
6302 2018-06-22 18:01:55 Crude Oil prints fresh session high at 68.80. #forex #CRUDEOIL
6303 2018-06-22 18:01:48 Dear Mr Blas, as a very interested follower of oil related news, could you please give some more context as why this is so relevant?
6304 2018-06-22 18:01:46 Oil: WTI keeps rising and hits $69.00 after OPEC agreement.
6305 2018-06-22 18:01:39 Is Bruce Willis and his oil drilling crew included somewhere?
6306 2018-06-22 18:01:34 More oil on the market means the cost will go down overall regardless of where you get it from.
6307 2018-06-22 18:01:33 Try releasing from the strategic oil reserve.
6308 2018-06-22 18:01:30 Never cut out poor food completely,  it's good to have a treat,  just cut down as much as you feel comfortable with. Also exercise is a great counter to lack of sugary and oil based foods.
6309 2018-06-22 18:01:28 Praying for the success of #pcusadivest today as @Presbyterian leaders call the church to divest from fossil fuels! These faithful activists walked 200+ miles to #GA223 to defend God's creation, and they deserve to know why some are still guarding their seat at Big Oil's table
6310 2018-06-22 18:01:25 Venezuela bedeutet aus dem Italienischen „Klein-Venedig“, aus dem Deutschen aber „wenig zu Öl da“ 
#OPEC #Oil #Venezuela
6311 2018-06-22 18:01:22 And Venezuela is the perfect example of what happens when you don't do that, but treat the national oil company as a cash cow on a starvation diet.

6317 2018-06-22 18:00:56 Art, do off shore GOM WELLS have longer life span than shale oil wells ? I was told off shore well has very high initial cost and longer lead time to initial production but the decline rate is low and life span is longer. Thanks.
6318 2018-06-22 18:00:54 But that doesn’t help domestic offshore oil exploration though.  Crude needs to be consistently above $70 per barrel for that to get rolling.  Shale drilling, on the other hand, is rocking and rolling.
6319 2018-06-22 18:00:52 The Gulf is open to Foreign countries to pump oil and Obama cut our oil production using British Petroleum's Deepwater Horizon Disaster as an excuse? 

Spain, France, Brazil, England, Netherlands, Cuba & China are drilling in the Gulf right now...

Good for @POTUS  -   FAIR TRADE

6335 2018-06-22 17:59:51 Nigga what? There are thousands and thousands of lifeforms in the oceans (many of which you and I both eat) who have suffered from oil spills, so a better question is: why don’t you care about the ocean? lol
6336 2018-06-22 17:59:49 IMO it's the seeds for lifting sanctions and more, Trumps concerned about Oil prices has risen thanks to Putin and Saudis what do you think
6337 2018-06-22 17:59:47 Every time I'm gonna give myself a T-shot I'm like  spooky
Funnily enough my problem isn't stabbing myself, it's just awkwardly holding the syringe in place while slowly pushing the oil in...

6339 2018-06-22 17:59:26 AND PROMOTED by those in the so called "freedom movement" on the right.  Those guys make millions selling the snake oil of "consent" lol
6340 2018-06-22 17:59:21 Trump having to beg OPEC to sell more oil to bring down prices in America.  

Guess cutting regulations, opening up drilling and huge tax breaks isn't enough to make the USA energy independent.    We still have to beg Saudi's.
6341 2018-06-22 17:59:20 This sounds like some Trotsky nonsense and while yeah, America is the biggest perpetrator, fantasizing about a post-rev world where every contra, fascist, Koch brother, oil baron, and multi national corporation has been vanquished might be fun, it's pretty unproductive.
6342 2018-06-22 17:59:00 Do not have the Insalata De Marie @Carluccios - it is mostly oil and very little sea food. Basically 400 calories of oil and 100 of everything else. Very disappointing.
6343 2018-06-22 17:58:52 It had everything to do with him because he lets them all know what will happen if they don’t stop this crap and they respond because if he cut them off for just one single day, it would cost them billions. He needs to say, we are going to use our own oil until prices drop (snap)
6344 2018-06-22 17:58:51 Guess it takes an hour and a half for a dealer to change my oil someone hmu

6348 2018-06-22 17:58:41 I remember when you suggested this. I love this shit. And their Amla and Olive Oil Heavy Cream.
6349 2018-06-22 17:58:36 There's plenty of oil production here, but it's exported.  Ain't that a crock of shit?
6350 2018-06-22 17:58:21 See they stole our saying just adding red to it! How bout red mud puddle, or red sprinkle, or red oil leak, or red toilet water, or red toilet flushing, or red puddle of urine. There's so many you should use!
6351 2018-06-22 17:58:20 The fact is, it was probably the worst possible choice to pick that jacket. She's the FIRST LADY, she represents our country as well. I guess no one remembers Fox having a seizure when Michelle Obama wore white to an oil spill?

6359 2018-06-22 17:57:53 Never suffered from acne thank god, but used to get the odd spot in my Thirties. Changed my diet so that I done away with a lot of oil based foods and haven't had a problem since
6360 2018-06-22 17:57:52 now for all of bts to be blessed with a hot oil treatment and we’re good to go
6361 2018-06-22 17:57:50 Burned the hell out of myself trying to reverse sear a chicken breast. Chicken slipped from my tongs about a foot above the skillet and splashed smoking hot oil up my arm. But when you're blind and insist on cooking, shit's gonna happen. *But* the chicken was incredible!
6362 2018-06-22 17:57:46 If true that’s great. Too bad it won’t help the $4.00(+) a gallon for gas here in Taxifornia. With the increase in oil production, we can expect another gas increase. Thank you Jerry Brown and your merry band of liberals.
6363 2018-06-22 17:57:41 Trump begs OPEC to sell the USA more oil........
6364 2018-06-22 17:57:39 one thing was the reversal yesterday of Obama restrictions on oil drilling
6365 2018-06-22 17:57:36 I love robotic oil poffins~!
6366 2018-06-22 17:57:25 Of course lower oil prices will continue to keeps rigs in Texas, Dakota’s, elsewhere on idle.

6368 2018-06-22 17:57:19 The same people investing in WeWork at a $40B valuation are also making capital allocation decisions for the world's largest oil company.
6369 2018-06-22 17:57:18 That's just because of Canadian taxes, not tariffs. I.e Canadian oil is taxed the same as us oil

6372 2018-06-22 17:57:06 Does it matter what is in #OPEC statement? #ksa & #Russia easily pump #Oil as soon as #Trump starts oil sanction againts #Iran
6373 2018-06-22 17:57:05 It would have been a "win" for us, either way.  If OPEC hiked oil prices, the US is one of the biggest world suppliers of crude oil.  We could just produce enough oil and gas to lower world prices, if we chose (we might have to if the Russians play games with Europe's supplies).
6374 2018-06-22 17:57:04 Oil prices have rallied in the wake of OPEC's decision on crude output... $OIL
6375 2018-06-22 17:57:02 Sad part is that the oil industry will just make this disappear and we won’t ever hear about it.... can only hope it’s different this time
6376 2018-06-22 17:56:58 Trump supporters are so dumb, I wouldn't be surprised if he slaps a huge tariff on OPEC oil, spikes gas prices, then kills the tariff and they'll all celebrate his victory in bringing the prices back down.
6377 2018-06-22 17:56:55 Not quite Sherlock. OPEC began raising oil prices when Trump pulled out of the Iran deal due to the "instability and unpredictability" of Trump's decision making.

6381 2018-06-22 17:56:35 Yes let's taint our natural water supplies with toxic waste and oil. Let's pollute all of our natural resources to the point they're unable to be used.

6394 2018-06-22 17:54:51 We won’t need OPEC if we keep on digging for oil
6395 2018-06-22 17:54:51 Instead of hoping, why not ask? OPEC says they have no official request from U.S. to increase production. What gives? @FoxNews @GOP @DNC Are all politicians in oil industries pocket? @CNBC @FoxBusiness

6406 2018-06-22 17:53:53 Thanks. Ross acknowledges past renewable energy tax credits; story cited $7b power grid (done by state; paid by utility customers). Ross argues that oil and gas are heavily subsidized through the tax system (long history of that, too). Coal also has had govt help, may get more.

6420 2018-06-22 17:52:59 OPEC is about to drive oil prices into the ground after Trump spent all this time making Russian oil viable.  That won’t go over well with Trump’s boss.  Trump is going to have to find a way to get auto makers to decrease efficiency.

6426 2018-06-22 17:52:30 Second of all her plantains look dry. No oil drenching that paper towel. It couldn’t be me.
6427 2018-06-22 17:52:23 Thought I'd jet wash the drive this afternoon spent ages trying to remove what I thought was an oil stain turned out to be a shadow.
6428 2018-06-22 17:52:17 With all the Trump family bankruptcies, I can understand your confusion. Our current administration is on a tariff spree. With are current situation, OPEC can take the lead by producing more oil and export to countries and undercut the U.S.
6429 2018-06-22 17:52:15 @realDonaldTrump Odd the US has oil in reserve enough for 20 years for two car family and the prices are still climbing so I suggested no gas buy day 2 times a week say Friday sat starting now no gas by day  every Friday sat till the end of the year stocks will drop loose money
6430 2018-06-22 17:52:10 The oil isn't gone from Deepwater .  Every summer it creeps back up. The tourist industry won't show you that.    ANd Trump wants to make more  deepwater Horizons.
6431 2018-06-22 17:52:09 The dude is sittin on a half mil in the bank but offers me a 30 dollar discount card he got free with an oil change ‘to help me out.’

Did I mention we’re dating a year now
6432 2018-06-22 17:52:08 Agreed. I’m looking for that motor oil looking coffee.
6433 2018-06-22 17:52:07 First step get an egg it is very crucial the egg is present

Fourth plate ur shit using a PLATE
6434 2018-06-22 17:52:03 I think from using too much oil? Idk it was my first time cooking chicken!
6435 2018-06-22 17:51:55 Trump's aggravating China is having reactions - Someone needs to tell @POTUS45 that economics was the root behind our involvement in World War II that is: w/Japan's oil embargo & Germany's economical ruins after WWI & ostracized economically gave Hitler an opening in government.
6436 2018-06-22 17:51:46 Today Kerris tried to remove her eyelash extensions with CHILLI infused olive oil, and then went blind for 20 mins

6440 2018-06-22 17:51:22 Yes, Turkish oil wrestlers have been quite dominant lately
6441 2018-06-22 17:51:19 Yeah I would use oil from keeping the beard hair healthy and balm for styling 
6442 2018-06-22 17:51:18 Odd the US has oil in reserve enough for 20 years for two car family and the prices are still climbing
6443 2018-06-22 17:51:13 Just more evidence how much Trudeau despises Alberta and its massive oil reserves. If one single person in Alberta votes Liberal in 2019, he/she should be deported to Quebec.
6444 2018-06-22 17:51:09 Keen to try out this new facial oil 
6445 2018-06-22 17:50:57 On reserves they do own the mineral rights and some old homesteads still have mineral rights. hence the money bands get from the oil/ gas companies.

6449 2018-06-22 17:50:28 I don't know why people come into my job ask me what oil their car uses and then continue to tell me yeah I'm just going to use 10w-40 instead because it's got a lot of miles.
6450 2018-06-22 17:50:25 Lol yea lemme put oil all over skin after I just got over acne. These medical professionals crazy
6451 2018-06-22 17:50:24 @chocolatemyers3 @Noble_Jim  Are the different Ford Teams allowed to use their sponsors motor oil in the cars or does Rousch/Yates dictate which motor oils to use?  Ie 2/22/12 Pennzoil 4/10/14/41 Mobile 1?
6452 2018-06-22 17:50:18 Nice word salad. French, Italian, 1000 Island, or Oil & Vinegar?

6457 2018-06-22 17:50:03 How does relying on foreign oil make America great. America was once the top producer of oil.
6458 2018-06-22 17:49:58 Applies to $OIL: when a market is squeezing & putting in big candles, unless already in, the best position is cash rather than top picking/chasing. Usually the market will consolidate to offer a much better setup/idea of direction. No need to trade anything but the best setups
6459 2018-06-22 17:49:56 Githeri media and basic truths are water and oil.

There are arrested for allowing substandard Fertilizer already condemned by their own internal tests. And for procuring substandard certification regimen wilfully and corruptly from some tumuhindi.

6460 2018-06-22 17:49:42 Hush, Junior. What do you know about the oil industry?????? About as much as your father does!!!
6461 2018-06-22 17:49:34 I get offended when people bless my food before they eat it. you think I didn't bless it while I was cooking? you think I wasn't drawing olive oil pentagrams in the pan? got me messed up.
6462 2018-06-22 17:49:22 Brad, please lead us out.  Trudeau hates the West & he hates Oil more. There will be no pipeline - it’s just lip service.  We need to Separate.
6463 2018-06-22 17:49:10 Yes that would help but also we could release some of our oil reserves and lower prices dramatically

6465 2018-06-22 17:49:05 U.S.; Canada; and Mexico should increase oil and natural gas supplies!
6466 2018-06-22 17:49:02 Only if you tip them over and oil gets in the cylinders
6467 2018-06-22 17:48:54 This was a problem with some of the very high leakage studies reported several years ago (9%+). They were often looking at oil fields with limited NG production. I'd be interested in how shale gas basins compare
6468 2018-06-22 17:48:40 He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.

The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look after him,’ he said, “I’m taking the kid to kid jail.”
6469 2018-06-22 17:48:32 Answer: there are more votes in Quebec & Ontario than west of Ontario as car & aeroplane industry is mainly in these 2 populous provinces. It’s not about the “climate”, it’s about vote buying.

Great for Canada would be a national east-west #EnergyCorridor for elec, oil and gas !
6470 2018-06-22 17:48:29 If I was a President , I wouldn't lie, I'd tell the people the Truth. "I like U, Love my lifestyle and having lavish shit. In order to keep our country with some money, we are gonna send my Marines to Syria and bomb the shit out of them, we need that oil, for support U Dig!!!
6471 2018-06-22 17:48:27 Got a golf date with my husband on Sunday...might tell him the cooking oil is suntan lotion so I can actually get a bit of a challenge going. Not that I'm competitive or anything.
6472 2018-06-22 17:48:25 Just changed my oil for the first time by myself and I have to say it’s a very satisfying feeling to do it and not have anyone getting uptight with me while I do it

6475 2018-06-22 17:47:59 For all the noise that there was around Crude Oil, all it did was retest former support within an uptrend. Worked off that bearish divergence in momentum and didn't get oversold.

Nice move today, still think it's headed to 76.80.

6494 2018-06-22 17:46:30 Hi Wiiloam and he's claiming gas prices will go down. The increase in production triggered a jump in oil prices, not a reduction. So now gas will cost MORE. Junior, face it. you're just as dumb as your daddy.

6525 2018-06-22 17:43:31 Ah! And the way you worded that is even more telling - you a spokesperson for the EU - and the EU doesn’t want oil, gas, fisheries, wind-farms, aero and marine engineering, exports worth £billions, top universities and a geo-political arm in in the North Atlantic?!  Liar!

6548 2018-06-22 17:41:10 Yes, things you mentioned are socialist in nature. But look at the rampant mismanagement in Venezuela.

6560 2018-06-22 17:40:25 CBD oil without THC is not psychoactive and brilliant for afflictions commonly co-occuring with addiction (anxiety, depression), not to mention physical pain; have you heard what they're doing in the jungles of Peru for addicts? #Takiwasi
6561 2018-06-22 17:40:22 So the oil is sort of a catalyst for the force? *takes notes*
6562 2018-06-22 17:40:21 oh look fake internet problems that have never happened. If youre letting jimmy badboy from the one eyed snakes convince you to rub motor oil in it, i think we have two idiots on our hands.
6563 2018-06-22 17:40:17 so the day after i get my oil changed, my a/c goes out, on my way to the dealership to have it fixed, i get rear ended, and now i have a nail in one of my tires which can’t just be patched so THATS ANOTHER $130 YAY

6568 2018-06-22 17:40:04 Can't really separate them, since so much gas production is associated with oil. The leak percentages seem to attribute all of it to the gas.

6638 2018-06-22 17:33:08 You don’t know anything about oil and gas. 1mil isn’t enough to make a big enough difference at the pump. Might go down a few cents, but won’t counteract how much prices have risen. During the summer months it might not even do that.
6639 2018-06-22 17:32:58 America first, yeah! 

Oh wait...we need to keep gas guzzling cars on the road so that we can beg OPEC to keep feeding us more oil.  Yes, let's keep propping up countries like Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran.  Lies, nothing but lies.  #NotMyPresident #FakePresident #Impeach45
6640 2018-06-22 17:32:52 I am a huge Trump supporter but this probably wasn't the best tweet as oil rose ~5% today based on that news.
6641 2018-06-22 17:32:49 How about using our own oil (which we have plenty of) instead of relying on other countries to power ours???
6642 2018-06-22 17:32:43 Being that you and your daddy are oblivious to the price of oil and American oil jobs, let me spell it out for you, Bacon Boy: Lower oil prices = jobs lost.

6693 2018-06-24 23:57:22 As the #WhiteHouse proposes to expand offshore drilling, may we never forget the 2010 BP oil spill that left 11 dead and millions of gallons of oil in the gulf, impacting wildlife, tourism, recreation and fishing industries.  #DeepHorizon #oilspill #Gulf #Florida
6694 2018-06-24 23:57:10 I have oily skin all year round but when it’s hot the oil drips down my cheeks and deep fries my face
6695 2018-06-24 23:56:58 Nobody praying for more oil related disasters either. Do your job and fix that.
6696 2018-06-24 23:56:41 Did you know ... ?

Rose  vibrates at the highest frequency in all the plant kingdom. The scent of Rose essential oil or fresh flowers can greatly elevate your vibration.

6697 2018-06-24 23:56:41 Um what? Quebec uses oil, it’s just not Canadian oil. But yet you don’t complain about where it is sourced, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Venezuela, etc. So why don’t you say these countries “degrade global climate”?
6698 2018-06-24 23:56:36 You know it’s ready when that oil seep through the plate and leave lil dark spots

6701 2018-06-24 23:59:53 My numbers are from the USDA Oklahoma Ag statistics for 2017, comparable to 2015 & 2016  When researching I find Trump is correct mainstream media has a little truth with lots of wrong.  Yes all grains, oil crops and some non ag items. Why focus on beans? China most purchased.

6704 2018-06-24 23:58:49 Also making sunscreen with oil makes no sense cause you’ll fry like a chicken... 
sorry I’m salty I got so sunburnt today so I will blame the sun Hahaha
6705 2018-06-24 23:58:25 Wow. Interesting. Normally I'd roast it with sea salt and olive oil. But I needed to use up the bacon.
6706 2018-06-24 23:58:22 Always nice to ring the register, but thinking there is some more upside ahead for #Oil. *Where do you get back long $CL_F?
6707 2018-06-24 23:58:14 For the bread, use sour dough and toast it in a skillet with olive oil and salt. Gah so good.
6708 2018-06-24 23:58:13 Oh holy hell. I’m a liberal living in Texas, along with millions of others. The biggest cities, especially Austin- the heart of the tech sector which is responsible for rapid development and innovation, are liberal. Without liberals Texas would have oil and cow patties.

6721 2018-06-24 23:56:00 The country is literally falling apart. Massive unessessary deficits,  nafta left in tatters, oil pipeline not being built, gov anti-Christian policies, Trudeau a international joke...and this is what we get from our PM? I don't think useless idiot is too strong a phrase here.
6722 2018-06-24 23:55:47 Maybe someone should tell her racist ass that’s she’s not welcome and see how she feels.  She is clearly inciting violence against innocent people and therefore she should be fired. She doesn’t represent the people of America.

6726 2018-06-24 23:54:21 Yes! With lemon and olive oil.
6727 2018-06-24 23:54:16 Friends, re my diet: You must have so many great recipes with all the cooking you’re doing! Share!

Me, re my diet: Every night I dump frozen vegetables in the oven, cover them in olive oil and roast them until they’re purposely burnt, and then eat them out of the pan.
6728 2018-06-24 23:54:04 If you’re not eating radishes slow roasted in the oven with some s + p, drizzled with a good olive oil....you don’t know what you’re missing!!!
6729 2018-06-24 23:53:59 Hahaha your president  is the one who sells oil for ISIS so they make money, your president is the one who lets terrorists join ISIS through his boarders. Your president took over parts of Syria just like what ISIS does.
6730 2018-06-24 23:53:57 My scalp loves me now after this hot oil treatment  it’s been begging me for months but I’ve been too lazy.
6731 2018-06-24 23:53:50 Oh please... @MyFWC doesn't have time to investigate minor crimes against simple wildlife such as turtles.... they are waaaayyy to busy speeding up & down I-95, I-4 and the Turnpike in their F350 monster trucks.  Oil Slick Rick's @ScottforFlorida finest!
6732 2018-06-24 23:53:35 Bc oil spills are such a good thing. Bc it kills all those pesky animals that liberals love so much.  Next he will be coming out against Green Peace like he did against Planned Parenthood.  Misinformed and ignorant.
6733 2018-06-24 23:53:34 It might seem like it Carol but people are listening, maybe not the  ones you want to at the moment but remember, ' the squeaky gate  the oil' keep at it love,

3. some light exercise/stretching/yoga
4. do something you’re afraid of?
5. A hot drink w/ olive oil, or butter & lemon juice?
Sorry, I’m not sure what will work for you. Strong coffee worked for me.
6769 2018-06-24 23:47:12 wish i wasnt going to hear about cbd oil every day for the rest of my life but i guess thats just how it is now

And you have me out here doing semi-professional shoots for you now, oil and everything. :P

6772 2018-06-24 23:47:02 Sorry to hear that girl, Hope things work out for you. You should move up to Fort Mac, not because I live up here but because the oil price is going up, everything is getting busy up here. Just a thought.
6773 2018-06-24 23:46:54 The price of gas is way up but the price of oil is lower then it was before before oil crash! These oil companies want their tax breaks & subsidies but continue to raise the price of gas! F**k them they deserve nothing more until they quit ripping us off! 
Leaching Scumbags!
6774 2018-06-24 23:46:16 Yummy we eat that all the time here in OZ, best way is get nice pice about 8" dip it in flour then grill it on the BBQ plate or frying pan with a little oil 
6775 2018-06-24 23:45:54 Say that to Donald Trump ongoing bromance with monarchs, next time he dancing with Arab men covered in head robes,stop buying their oil and selling them weapons to kill Yemenese children.
6776 2018-06-24 23:45:45 Not sure who you think is a guide for hunts.  Not me.  Am I wrong when I say oil companies and government are in bed with each other? Or that the problem isn't capitalism?
6777 2018-06-24 23:45:44 We send our kids to die to control oil... Hmm, what could they be thinking trying to get to the USA...
6778 2018-06-24 23:45:22 Let’s end the culture of deregulation, privatization, unfettered guns, Old Testament theocracy,unfettered capitalism, let’s move to the FDR culture of the New Deal and Johnson great society, more government benefits, welcoming immigrants, regulate guns, oil companies and Wall St

6780 2018-06-24 23:44:54 I'm amazed that people say that [though I don't watch TV so I don't know what the talking heads say]. I get my general oil news from Macro Voices and looking at prices and reading things here and there.

It wouldn't take three days.

6795 2018-06-24 23:42:29 We employ more people in solar energy industry than in gas, oil & coal COMBINED. We should be the leader in green energy not clinging to fossil fuel industry which is on the decline worldwide. We are losing our edge in technology & medical research.

6817 2018-06-24 23:38:45 Morning all,
Hope everyone had a great weekend. We learnt a few things:
- Oil had a massive $3 gain.
- Cricket is in turmoil after first clean sweep against England.
- Blues are winners, and
- Billy Slater still an awesome player.
Trade well!
6818 2018-06-24 23:38:42 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.
6819 2018-06-24 23:38:39 One note about oil. Marijuana is not a lubricant. Even driving while high won't change the outcome of a motor with no oil in it.

6828 2018-06-24 23:36:25 I can see your point there, though that depends on an opinion that your specific example is an example of wasting taxpayer dollars. Long-term that could have paid off big in terms of cheaper oil and stronger relations (maybe an ally?) in the Middle East.
6829 2018-06-24 23:36:18 LW: Extent of oil spill, its cause still unclear as cleanup continues in Doon, Iowa
6830 2018-06-24 23:35:28 かんせるさんの歌みた聴いて寝落ちしてて、寝起きからいい声聴こえてきて幸せな寝起きでした。
6831 2018-06-24 23:35:15 Killing the environment for profit is horrible, everybody out here acting like oil spills is the only thing killing our environment but what about the amount of trees that are being chopped down for profit?? Ain’t nobody saying shit on here about that.

6833 2018-06-24 23:34:47 One of my co-workers said my hair looked shiny, because of the olive oil I put in this morning....13 hours ago
6834 2018-06-24 23:34:38 tell me why woahvicky's hair looks like she dipped it in a pile of oil in the walmart parking lot
6835 2018-06-24 23:34:16 Call me if you need a tire, oil, relationship change.
6836 2018-06-24 23:34:07 man. children put in cages, more oil spills in the ocean to come, big companies allowed to devastate protected natural monuments, social/human rights thrown out the window with ridiculous bills. when do the riots start already?
6837 2018-06-24 23:33:51 Glad to see Big Oil survives as well.
6838 2018-06-24 23:33:41 @bernielotv better fact check your guest Richard Harris, the USA is NOT self-sufficient in Oil production, they only produce 11M bbls/day or the 20M bbls/day they consume! Kind of question anything from this guest....
6839 2018-06-24 23:33:12 My sister called my face an oil mine
6840 2018-06-24 23:33:09 I can tell you this. They tax the Oklahoma oil and gas industry for this OERB reclaimation work. I know this because they tax me. If we want it back, we can apply to get a refund yearly. No one does. Therefore we voluntarily pay the tax. But you think what you want.
6841 2018-06-24 23:33:09 That’s because trump can’t spell ‘oil’
6842 2018-06-24 23:33:02 うちは基本フレックスなのでW杯見てた人は今日遅いのかもしれんけど、そんぐらいでいいのです。
6843 2018-06-24 23:33:01 We do know how to oil our g**s.
6844 2018-06-24 23:32:51 I do not respect liars, spin doctors or snake oil salesmen/women.... this is not about a difference in opinion....it is about morals....
6845 2018-06-24 23:32:46 I like AZUL better than GOL, as they are in les competitive routes. But 2Q18 is expected to be ugly, because of FX and oil. I like GGB & CIOXY for the bonds, not sure (GGB) for the equity. I am short Cielo shares.
6846 2018-06-24 23:32:31 If voters dont care about children. Oil prices are going up, affordable healthcare is disappearing, mortgage rates just went up again, the tax break people thought they got is only good for a couple years, and with Trump's trade war the price of everything will be going up.
6847 2018-06-24 23:32:03 So I made the mistake of washing my head scarf with my work shirts...let’s just say I need new shirts. All that hair oil

6849 2018-06-24 23:31:27 You CAN - but it won’t be used for a wig, they’ll sell it (companies who clean up oil spills actually for one way) and that $ will help offset admin costs.
6850 2018-06-24 23:31:17 you know...if you could get away with it, there's a business plan to pursue!

(more indies make money off other indies than they do off writing fiction. May as well join the club and actually do something useful instead of selling some snake oil of a promotions program.)

6854 2018-06-24 23:30:26 About around the time Alberta will not have oil anymore...  
Canada is a good country, if we can work together, it will stay great for a long time.
6855 2018-06-24 23:30:21 Why don’t you start a gofundme to buy marijuana oil.  A dude managed to get $15,000 to make potato salad I’m sure u can get donations for cannibus oil.  I’ll donate.
6856 2018-06-24 23:30:12 I do not respect people who lie, spin doctors, or snake oil salesmen/women...neither should you!

6858 2018-06-24 23:30:08 I’ll never forget that day my mom’s ex said some shit like he was about to come kill us. Boop. First mistake was announcing it. My nigga, we put boiling oil on the stove and had knives on us just WAITING for that nigga to attack lmao
6859 2018-06-24 23:30:03 Thanks,exactly so,missed past oil exports ports,supply lines,world,8 years, Harper's rivalry with Obama,friendship with Trump,damaged oil industry,West/East coast exports

6861 2018-06-24 23:29:41 The world is laughing at Canada. Not one politician has put forward a plan of what the people of Fort McMurray are going to do when the oil sands are shut down.
6862 2018-06-24 23:29:39 "I mean, they're not gonna kill ya, so if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock, they won't do it again...

6869 2018-06-24 23:28:38 What did u find out about your type of leukemia and marijuana oil?  Does it help?  Any anecdotal stories about cures? There is a girl, 14 who used strictly oil and her physician tracked the cancer cells and they were dying.
6870 2018-06-24 23:28:25 I think it is about time that Canada start charging properly for the trees(lumber), clean water, and oil that we almost give to the US. Then we would not have to bother placing any restrictions on the wood products and bottled water that is highly marked up and sold back to us.
6871 2018-06-24 23:28:23 Ironic thing is it helps the export of oil and natural gas.

6874 2018-06-24 23:27:45 I learned in a David Wilcock youtube video that Vitamin K2 (Skate liver oil) can help cleanse the 3rd eye.  So I bought an abundant supply of the Skate Liver capsules.  I hope its true.  I also discarded all Fluoride toothpaste.
6875 2018-06-24 23:27:29 Ok, so I’m not sure what the conversions are but it’s 250 millilitres soya milk, punch of salt, 4 teaspoons of cider vinegar, 2 teaspoons of mustard powder, juice fro half a lemon 450 millilitres of rapeseed oil... blitz all together

Aventis make billions making taxtear in Dagenham plant and jobs moved to Germany. Coryton oil refinery moved to holland. How are we better off
6885 2018-06-24 23:25:52 it would probably just be olive oil

6887 2018-06-24 23:25:02 They learned absolutely nothing from 2016. If you watch 2016 campaign commercials, HRC = hectoring moralizing and artsy pictures of minorities. Trump had clear messages. HRC = crime, war, bad econ. Trump = safety, security, jobs. 

If Ds take House it's in spite of themselves.
6888 2018-06-24 23:24:52 após muito refletir (e considerando que passei o dia estudando), concluí que não tem problemas se eu fizer um chazinho agora e tentar escrever um pouquinho o cap de oil on canvas

6894 2018-06-24 23:24:11 To the talking heads on TV, I wish to say: Stop saying that USA is self-sufficient in oil! It isn't. Domestic production only accounts for half of the consumption, but the floodgates are open to export a quarter of that production. America still needs to import. A lot. #OOTT

6938 2018-06-24 23:16:45 As an Arkansan, I can state that he's long been an embarrassment. Huckabee is a backwards racist that cloaks himself in "religion" to avoid criticism, while also making it easier to sell snake oil to rubes.

6942 2018-06-24 23:16:17 It makes me so angry when we are trying to save the planet and oceans from plastic and now potus has undone the ban on oil released into the ocean. Seriously someone remove him as president. No president should be allowed to get away with this. Sick fuck

6961 2018-06-24 23:14:17 I’m sure a little coconut oil will do the trick......
6962 2018-06-24 23:14:10 Thanks for highlighting reality 
6963 2018-06-24 23:13:51 Had to share because today was awesome planting oil seeds I love my job.

6964 2018-06-24 23:13:49 Indonesia menempati peringkat 1 dalam produk pertanian,
yaitu : cengkeh (cloves) & pala (nutmeg), serta no.2 dalam karet
alam (Natural Rubber) dan minyak sawit mentah (Crude Palm Oil).
6965 2018-06-24 23:13:34 Oil is responsible for the world we live in, the good and the bad but it has been great for humanity to date even though we now need to evolve beyond our dependence on it.
6966 2018-06-24 23:13:30 Oil gas is at 3.53 today all cause you pull out of Iran....you making American pay for all your crap rubbish policy
6967 2018-06-24 23:13:14 Agree. Oil dow  will tank spooz directly and nq via higher real rates unless real rates get rerated too (unlikely as it s already too dovish).
Safer to short spooz or the cac40
6968 2018-06-24 23:13:04 Yuck.rather make my own. Air fryer, 1 tbs of oil and lemon pepper. Done.
6969 2018-06-24 23:13:03 laissez faire, laissez passer

6971 2018-06-24 23:12:55 My god, this is insanity! What does the end of this story look like??
6972 2018-06-24 23:12:55 We have others source of "energie" like hydro elec, we are exploiting others resources of our country like mines, forests... Let just say that we agree to disagree about fracking. About the pipeline, they closed oil refineries in Mtl, we should have transformed your oil...
6973 2018-06-24 23:12:42 Mineral oil works
6974 2018-06-24 23:12:32 Have u tried medical marijuana oil. There is actual proof it kills leukemia

6977 2018-06-24 23:12:15 And Arya came in looking like she's gonna change your oil...
6978 2018-06-24 23:11:41 Oil change & pedicure tomorrow g fr 
6979 2018-06-24 23:11:31 Selling oil and buying food is the singular historical installation of a social machine based upon cybernetic escalation (positive feedback), reproducing itself only incidentally, as an accident of continuous socio-industrial revolution.
6980 2018-06-24 23:11:21 However I'm gonna cut my ends officially before I get braids & I'm going to make this oil serum ohhh yesss
6981 2018-06-24 23:11:17 Wait for it keep the tariffs on Canadian goods we’ll put a a surcharge on our cheap oil and make you 6.00 a gallon just get rid of the guy before he destroys the whole world
6982 2018-06-24 23:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: soggy crust with sad coconut oil and apple wood smoked bacon.

6984 2018-06-24 23:10:45 In the case of Switzerland I think it is obvious They are rich Lichtenstein same Lots of big finance there Norway has its Billions+ oil fund  and Iceland, well it's historical Huge delays at Swiss-French borders, delays at Norway-Sweden too
6985 2018-06-24 23:10:38 He owns stock in oil. Why do you think he pushed DAPL through native land and their water source
6986 2018-06-24 23:10:36 他にどれだけ使うか分かんないからお金足りない気がする

6990 2018-06-24 23:10:02 Italian veg recipes? I cook like this a lot. Pasta aglio olio (Garlic and olive oil, optional red pepper). Pasta w/ Broccoli or broccoli rabe and pine nuts, or w/ Fresh raw tomatoes & basil,or sautéed zucchini. Walnut pesto. Sicilian pesto: sun dried tom, ricotta, almonds.
6991 2018-06-24 23:09:46 I don't wanna be, but also remember sentiment, as far as money flows go, is still rather neutral.  Signals more downside in short term at least
6992 2018-06-24 23:09:45 And oil them,desperate to remain relevant.
6993 2018-06-24 23:09:32 It will go on the 10 Day DL for an oil change but with the Mets training staff it will wind up needing a full engine replacement and be out for two seasons

6995 2018-06-24 23:09:27 Fact: it takes the Same amount of time to make your own popcorn on the stove as it does to pop the microwave stuff. The result is a far healthier and and more flavourful snack. No modified palm oil in this bowl!
6996 2018-06-24 23:09:11 I don't think anyone regrets donating. 
6997 2018-06-24 23:09:06 Thank goodness more rational voices are drowning this socialist out.  They’re going down with a little fight. We are here because we stood on the sideline and almost lost our Country because of it. Time to raise our voices and shine the light on snake oil. Trump will. No doubt.
6998 2018-06-24 23:09:00 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
6999 2018-06-24 23:08:15 Just dropped my facial oil and it went allllll over my new sofas and carpet
7000 2018-06-24 23:07:53 this doofus is the guy that called for $19 dollar oil start of 2016, wasn't he?
7001 2018-06-24 23:07:47 #90DayFiance Paola! I’m a grandmother and here’s a word of advice. You’re so called best friend is trying to break up your marriage. That’s NOT a best friend.  Your husband is acting like your best friend. It’s time to grow up.  why do you constantly try to merge oil & water?
7002 2018-06-24 23:07:35 sounds grim
7003 2018-06-24 23:07:34 Well drink enough MCT oil and you get the same result!  
7004 2018-06-24 23:07:01 I'm craving for proper chips. Thick cut, bathing in oil, salt and vinegar.

7009 2018-06-24 23:06:45 Ah man, you can get enough chicken and vegetables for a week or so for $20 and I guarantee you’ll be more full than you are eating seasoned rice...and pasta with olive oil...just sayin, it doesn’t have to be like that
7010 2018-06-24 23:06:42 When they assassinated Kennel Muammar Gaddafi, “the world” & some Lybians celebrated. Years down the line they’re worse off. They realize the WEST botched them coz its selfish interests; OIL.
The same happened to Zimbabwe on 15 November 2017. Only time will tell!  #BeholdTheNew
7011 2018-06-24 23:06:40 After renting the house out for two years, we're discovering our tenant was scared and put oil crosses on all the doors, confirming my suspicion that our home is haunted. 

Then again, he also told us that he saw Bigfoot in the backyard.
7012 2018-06-24 23:06:34 Lavender CBD oil is so good

7014 2018-06-24 23:06:10 Yep
7015 2018-06-24 23:05:54 Shocker. The biggest oil bull is bullish.
7016 2018-06-24 23:05:49 Record sales two years in a row.  Thanks, Democrats!
7017 2018-06-24 23:05:45 there’s a $20 discount for Permian oil vs Brent. If #OPEC pumps more oil it brings down Brent. Since gasoline is priced off of highest crude oil, OPEC pumping more oil brings down gasoline prices for consumers. It also gives him more bargaining power with this trade stuff.

7020 2018-06-24 23:05:19 Yes, long term oil price outlook changed significantly, along with AECO gas pricing. This is not a short term change like your off the shelf quote suggested. Perhaps the formula is less fair now than 5 years ago.
7021 2018-06-24 23:05:13 I agree. So many “BOOMS” and what seems like an enabling investigation, as time drags on and our country and critical agencies and institutions are being dismantled before our eyes. Hell! Zinke is selling off our (once protected) private lands to the highest bidder! Oil & Gas $$$

7029 2018-06-24 23:03:49 Oil, oil, in my hair. Oil, oil everywhere. Amad climb through the garage looking for tools, 3 trips to O’Reillys, 2 oil changes later (different cars) and I’m done! #feelingaccomplished

7033 2018-06-24 23:02:59 Even if they were as safe, which they are not, oil transport displaces and drives up the cost to transport other goods like wheat or potash. I’m in Sherbrooke, which no longer has the MM&A line because of Lac Mégantic. When’s the last time a pipeline killed 45 ppl?

7042 2018-06-24 23:00:58 PS: most theaters serve something they call "buttery topping" which often means hydrogenated palm kernel oil flavored to taste like butter...and future hardening of the arteries!
7043 2018-06-24 23:00:55 I've never seen more ungrateful people in my life as entitled Albertans  who by the accident of birth have been blessed (or cursed depending on your POV) with oil running under their ground , bountiful riches their fellow citizens/provs aren't so lucky to have  #inittogether
7044 2018-06-24 23:00:49 One correction: It cost over $1.2 billion to NOT clean up the Kalamazoo River spill, and to pay damages when Enbridge gave up. Tar + chemicals to make it flow is not really oil at all.
7045 2018-06-24 23:00:48 Yrs, what exactly is the upside to anything or anyone? Cheaper to be an oil company, raise prices, increase profits....Trumps bought oil stocks just before thed policy change?
7046 2018-06-24 23:00:46 Remittances from USA is Mexico's Top income source, over and above their crude oil production.

7049 2018-06-24 23:00:18 What? Oil slicks reduce waves or something?
7050 2018-06-24 23:00:05 I see a correction at the end of this story - it should also be corrected to say 'oil sands' instead of the incorrect and inflammatory "tar sands".
7051 2018-06-24 22:59:56 Your hero just rolled back Obama regulations to prevent oil spills. Like seafood? It may have a "slick" taste in the future.

7055 2018-06-24 22:59:09 It may yet turn out to be, for reasons not related to immigration. Climate mitigation is not even in on the horizon in American politics amidst unprecedented military spending and thirst for oil. America remains the worlds most strident polluter, Trump was simply more of the same

7059 2018-06-24 22:58:48 and the idea that white nationalists are the only thing, if anything, worth criticising or worrying about on the right is ludicrous. The right is infested with liars, crackpots, opportunists and snake oil salesmen and they have a president to match.

7065 2018-06-24 22:58:12 You have any essential oil diffuser recommendations.
7066 2018-06-24 22:57:50 B/c gasoline is priced off of world oil prices. Brent is $20+ bbl higher than Permian oil. Luckily midstream companies are building new infrastructure to help alleviate. This should bring gasoline prices down.
7067 2018-06-24 22:57:22 "Ouh! Bongo..." Gnar gives the oil drum a tentative tap

7073 2018-06-24 22:56:39 Yeah soap and water removes the oil coating. you’re not supposed to wash them. Just a quick wipe down immediately after cooking.

7085 2018-06-24 22:55:33 how long til the oil runs out? nah, that's not the problem, you guys are actually saving/investing the money not converting the desert into a golf-course.

7093 2018-06-24 22:54:49 AB can express its opinion, but frankly its opinion is an embarrassment to this Albertan. We are the richest province in Canada thanks to oil wealth - decades of it - and we'd rather complain about QC and to Ottawa than tend to our own fiscal management.

7120 2018-06-24 22:50:32 Actually, my family has been happily living in the same spot since Alberta was Rupert's Land, Confederation wasn't an idea, and lamps used whale oil.  So I don't particularly give a womp womp about equalization payments.

But hey, if you can send some rain, I'd appreciate it! 
7121 2018-06-24 22:50:27 The inflammatory stupidity. I’d expect nothing less from her. She and her ilk are modern day snake oil shills...
7122 2018-06-24 22:50:23 Ahhhhh, practicing mob violence and Fascism  just like in the old days of the pro-slavery/Jim Crow Democrats. They can’t help it. It’s in their blood.
7123 2018-06-24 22:50:19 He's golfing!  What promises?  Not protecting the environment?  Removing protection for oil spills?  Horrible response to Maria in Puerto Rico?  Tax breaks for the wealthy?  Higher prices?  Falling stock market?   You probably still think Mexico is going to pay for a wall.

7125 2018-06-24 22:50:12 i know cbd oil is different than weed, but i really cant stand how weed makes me feel so im hoping this works.
7126 2018-06-24 22:49:39 just ordered my first ever cbd oil. im so new to this but need a natural way to treat anxiety rather than taking too much of my medicine or drinking occasinaly. cant wait for it to come in

7132 2018-06-24 22:49:01 Here's a hint of olive oil, and THAT, kids, is the greatest sport I've ever read.
7133 2018-06-24 22:48:39 The AC is funded by NATO, the U.S. military, Big Oil, and various Gulf countries. I'll give you 3 guesses as to whether or not they think dead children are meaningless collateral damage in the quest for US dominance and control of middle  eastern oil fields.
7134 2018-06-24 22:48:23 Dunno if it’s the tea tree oil or the sun but my skin looks sooo much better since I’ve been on holiday
7135 2018-06-24 22:48:11 It’s not bollocks. Russia still holds one of the 5 permanent seats on the UN Security Council, has a large modernised nuclear arsenal, the worlds 4th biggest defence budget and is still the worlds largest oil producer. It’s in economic decline, sure, but it’s still a big player.

7141 2018-06-24 22:47:11 Go again with your daughter and her husband to KSA and take the oil for free. Just tell them you will be against Iran and Qatar and you will support them against Yemen. The king son of KSA will give you even his father for free.
7142 2018-06-24 22:46:58 I just made a bowl with sautéed onions, cauliflower, broccoli, mushrooms, sweet potatoes and red peppers* on top of a bed of honey sesame ginger (raw) carrots and topped that with a tilapia filet seared in sriracha and olive oil

7147 2018-06-24 22:46:29 Well if you think about it, cars are using thinner oil and lighter materials. You have to ask about the longevity of your investment as opposed to the way it was before.The M.P.G is negligible.

7152 2018-06-24 22:46:10 I was thinking about these rolling through our city today as I watched TV footage of the latest oil spill derailment in the USA.  Is there a bandwagon I can get on working towards rail line relocation?
7153 2018-06-24 22:46:04 Looks like we’re about 10 minutes away from the start of the Dooley Oil Classic championship between Laramie and Fort Morgan
7154 2018-06-24 22:45:29 And when she cooks, she fries things like 80% of the time and gets oil everywhere and my multucooker is always dirty cause of it just like the stove. And I clean it every day and every day it gets same dirty :'( what is this hell
7155 2018-06-24 22:44:43 4) I punti da connettere, riguardo FR/USA sono:
a) che la banca libica, come l'iraquena e northcoreana, erano PUBBLICHE,  cioe' NON-ROTH.
b) Che Gheddafi voleva vendere Oil-for-Gold (come Saddam Oil-for-Euro)
c) che voleva soppiantare il franco CFA (coloniale, 14 stati africani)
7156 2018-06-24 22:44:42 Oil of olay needs to have me in their commercials....71 years old and just told I looked 52... never used anything but oil of

7159 2018-06-24 22:44:29 Did he do it illegally? If not him.. somebody else would have been in his place. Maybe down the line oil companies will moan that renewable energy drove them out if business.
7160 2018-06-24 22:44:26 They only profit from OIL ! Public transportation reduces their profits.

A complaint will be coming in. Awful service from the dealership #poorcustomerservice #mazda
7167 2018-06-24 22:43:18 I was riding a motorcycle lubricated in cod liver oil whilst wearing a jacket with "Big Evil" emblazoned onto it so that's FAKE
7168 2018-06-24 22:43:11 Isn’t that planning an assassination on all of us honest Conservative Republican folk???  Those Dems just keep killing us and blaming us for killing ourselves. Obama told All the crazy f u democrats to get up into our face, and what??? Now crazy Maxine!! something bout killing us
7169 2018-06-24 22:43:06 how much are you paying them? we know you have millions made off your stupid dvds and snake oil supplements and shakes. You are just like Trump. btw have you asked him if he agrees with you that 9-11 was an inside job?
7170 2018-06-24 22:42:55 Maybe if Mexico had oil lol Canada is more at risk. I think his threats of tariffs is all talk. And it's working. Remember, he's not a politician but a businessman. Everything is about appearances. That's why I look at what he DOES and not what he SAYS.

7189 2018-06-24 22:40:02 Without carbon pricing, coal, oil and gas get an advantage because the cost of emissions is socialized. Free markets don’t work if you ignore negative social impacts. It’s like competing with business that don’t have to pay salaries.
7190 2018-06-24 22:39:57 They still have yet to try and rally the Gay, lesbian and black vote. They've targeted the soon to be voters, now pushing amnesty so  keep an eye out for the next #FalseFlag before the election to drum up the base.
7191 2018-06-24 22:39:43 I just got a bottle of cbd oil & dropped it shattering/spilling the whole bottle && I ripped my new pants on the butt so ... that’s how my day is going
7192 2018-06-24 22:39:34 Wife and I just sealed 700+ sq feet of new redwood fence with Penofin (Brazilian hardwood oil).  1/3 done.  

It hurts.
7193 2018-06-24 22:39:15 a trade deficit isn’t solved by tariffs, it’s solved by creating economic independence. when you strip protections for domestic farmers, you are sure to increase the deficit. when you pump money into big oil instead of diverse energy portfolios, you increase the deficit.

He anoints my head with oil

7204 2018-06-24 22:37:31 the very basic summary of what little i’m absorbing here is that a while back the liberals tried to redistribute the oil wealth and alberta was like noooooo our moneyyyyyyy and now no one likes the liberal party here

7209 2018-06-24 22:36:48 Not if you bake them without oil. 
7210 2018-06-24 22:36:45 Goods r shipped using oil. Do you eat pineapple, canned or bottled goods. How many of the items in your home come from overseas? Oil is tanked in also. Why bully on green energy?  Maybe focus your energy on fossil fuels if you are truly interested in damage to the environment.

7215 2018-06-24 22:36:19 No one does a better, cleaner, or environmental friendlier, than the United States, when it comes to drilling for oil, gas, coal, oil refineries and fish friendly hydroelectric.
7216 2018-06-24 22:36:14 Changing the name and adding the name of a scientific discipline doesn't make it a valid theory. 

If you light your home with efficient LED's or inefficient whale oil, the value is the light produced and not the energy used to produce the light. The energy used is the cost.
7217 2018-06-24 22:35:44 When I offer to change the oil in your car, you'll know I'm fucking serious about you.
7218 2018-06-24 22:35:38 @iancollinsuk the bloke who said about swimming underwater after taking cod liver oil.  He was only codding.

7220 2018-06-24 22:35:14 I’m still wondering why North Dakota feels that immigration is a big problem.  Don’t you need workers for the oil fields?
7221 2018-06-24 22:34:59 There's absolutely no racial undertone to it, it was a joke and if you guys can't see the crude oil joke here, I'm sorry. I made 194 tweet today and you all want to rent canopy on one? Well, I have nothing to say or do to anyone.

7224 2018-06-24 22:34:41 The whole reason Rex Tillerson was made Secretary of State was to help Russia with their five hundred billion dollar arctic oil deal then the Russia investigation made Rex expendable.
7225 2018-06-24 22:34:23 If you’re antivaxx I hope you know I think you’re dumb as sheep being led to slaughter. You deserve to be put on an island with all the other idiots WITH NO WAY OUT and kill each other with your fucking essential oil remedies.
7226 2018-06-24 22:34:16 That, and to put more money in the pockets of his friends in Big Oil while destroying the planet. They're all old men who won't be on it much longer, so they don't give a damn.
7227 2018-06-24 22:34:09 "La AFIP hizo todo para mandar a la quiebra a Oil Combustibles SA y la detención de Cristóbal y De Sousa no se decidió en la justicia, sino en la Casa Rosada", señalaron desde la defensa de Cristóbal López a Clarín. L. Salinas. Clarín"

Con esta defensa, mínimo 30 años se come
7228 2018-06-24 22:34:04 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
7229 2018-06-24 22:34:04 How exactly are they loosing money when they are in full control of the price? They are allowed to charge whatever they want so, no. NO GRANTS FOR YOU! I have zero sympathy for oil companies crying that they are not getting rich fast enough. 
7230 2018-06-24 22:33:51 It’s crazy. Media constantly under attack, yet their product is consumed by those hypocrites attacking it. Then, when there isn’t enough, complain about it. I feel their pain, but I’m in the oil and gas bidnis.
7231 2018-06-24 22:33:44 Sam shivered at the bite. He felt himself getting closer too. He ran his tongue over the little hole where oil was produced, still sucking on it.
7232 2018-06-24 22:33:08 Yeah, thanks goodness,  she was made to swallow lots of palm oil and was taken to the hospital afterwards. She is okay after Lots of purging.
7233 2018-06-24 22:33:03 12/10 don’t recommend lavender oil on raw skin
7234 2018-06-24 22:33:02 People who say watercolor paint is a difficult medium never used oil paint.

Fuck that shit to hell and back
7235 2018-06-24 22:32:57 OILは結局んとこ5月22の最高値を超えるかどうかにかかってるよね。越えるようなら押し目かどっかで、切るしかないよね。
7236 2018-06-24 22:32:53 Are there no janitors in the oil and coal businesses?
7237 2018-06-24 22:32:45 It’s a funny statement, I suppose just passing the blame, Russia is better with higher oil prices.
7238 2018-06-24 22:32:44 I’ve been watch a lot of BBQ Pitmasters and noticed a lot of the pros don’t use mustard at all. Might use a little olive oil, but mainly puts their rubs straight on the meat.
7239 2018-06-24 22:32:34 me, burning lavender incense, diffusing lavender oil, and rubbing lavender balm all over my body: am i cured yet??

7244 2018-06-24 22:31:41 Mr. Softie oil.
7245 2018-06-24 22:31:37 Process is the key word. Man City was brought in 2008 and didn’t win anything for three years and that’s with oil money but they kept building the team to eventually get to the level they wanted where they were finally a sexy attraction but even they didn’t buy big automatically
7246 2018-06-24 22:31:21 who knows ? some say its the aduvants - aluminium, peanut oil (guess where those allergies comes from) etc, dna fragments from aborted baby cells, live viruses, thimersal (ethyl mercury) , kinda strange they use the same amount for a baby as they do for a 300lb man

7250 2018-06-24 22:30:34 The US should have made more use of its own wells. Many were capped in the fifties and sixties, to be kept in reserve. They instead relied on cheap Saudi oil.

7259 2018-06-24 22:29:11 My dad washed, vacuum, did an oil change andddd fixed my breaks on my car while I was gone. I’ve never felt so loved by him 
7260 2018-06-24 22:28:54 the northern moab area is now the center of attraction - because of oil 
(Genie), golan hights (need to take a closer look if its the same location on point) ...  I´m guessing it is not only oil, but possibly a big piece of meteor(ore) with (magical) properties.

7261 2018-06-24 22:28:38 same girl, try tea tree oil ! it helps a lot !
7262 2018-06-24 22:28:37 This morning, @AriFleischer showed up in my feed bitching about this being a bridge too far.  You know what is a bridge too far? 1 million dead Iraqi’s in the name of OIL. If the royals can’t eat in peace, they’re getting off EASY.  They should fear for their safety in public.
7263 2018-06-24 22:28:00 Uau.... looks like an oil painting
...Beautiful...
I liked...
7264 2018-06-24 22:27:50 Yes I did. It leads to a spoiler but I describe this happening as "digging for gold and striking oil" LOL

A great feeling is making fiction create fact. It's even better the other way around. If that makes sense
7265 2018-06-24 22:27:47 Here I wasn’t thinking it was an oil field   Have to read up on it
7266 2018-06-24 22:27:45 If you're frittering them, don't strip the wee flowers of, but instead dip the whole flower head into batter and plunge into hot oil until the batter crisps. Serve with lemon, mint, and sugar to taste

7270 2018-06-24 22:27:26 oh my anxiety has been awful lol I’ve been taking cbd oil but still takes a lot for me to get out of bed and go out
7271 2018-06-24 22:27:05 My sleeping schedule is beginning to be ridiculously weird, I'm anxious (because of all the changes to come), and I can't find either my lavender essential oil nor my chewy (I think I left it at the mom place).
I'll try to sleep, I guess

7274 2018-06-24 22:26:56 Here's the problem Brian.
It's not clear that you understand the Prov sales tax-equalization link.
And it's obvious that you & other equalization protesters won't even consider that mismanagement of oil& gas revenue is partly why AB is in this mess.
Those are 'no go' topics.
7275 2018-06-24 22:26:33 All our curries are tempered with spices fried in a little little rapeseed oil so we are not oil free

7285 2018-06-24 22:24:29 ... That sounds very bullish on US oil producers! Add a tarrif on oil due to any number of reasons...
7286 2018-06-24 22:24:27 Once the oil money stops flowing ISLAM will collapse because its Ideology is deeply flawed and Anti-Human rights !
7287 2018-06-24 22:24:23 Healthcare, lowered mortgage rates, regulations for polluters, Cleaner air, regulated predatory Bank lenders, refused oil drilling in pristine coastal areas, among a myriad of other protections for Americans. Everything Trump is reversing so his Billionaire Friends get richer.

When the sugar melts and turns into caramel, take the cockroach out of the pan and onto a plate, ready to serve.

What #OPEC did Friday was to pump up oil prices first to shore up for the expected plunge when it discloses the real intention of pumping 1M bpd later. This low-end dishonest business approach makes OPEC like an illegitimate underground organization.
7299 2018-06-24 22:22:56 Love is when your coworker is vaping and you ask for some and he says 'no fuck you, it's my cbd oil', and when you respectfully accept his answer he hands it to you anyways 
7300 2018-06-24 22:22:56 You folks need to burn more oil. And chop down all of your trees.

7302 2018-06-24 22:22:48 They'll probably plan to use the freed up land for Biofuel Crops and perhaps the Meat demonisation tactics are for this reason, as existing drillable oil resources aren't going to last forever and hence the development and introduction of Electric and Hybrid Cars. Planning ahead.

7306 2018-06-24 22:22:21 In addition the specific EV powertrain uses more exotic material mined and shipped with, guess what: oil.
7307 2018-06-24 22:22:17 This oil got me feeling lazy
7308 2018-06-24 22:22:09 Just in the last week or so there were two reports that said oil production is going to soar in Canada over the next few decades. We're not going to be consuming millions of extra barrels worth of production so it will have to be exported, i.e., the pipelines will be needed.
7309 2018-06-24 22:21:56 Cody apparently took out some frustration of losing last night to Laramie by beating Spearfish 15-3 in 5 innings for 3rd place. Rangers and Fort Morgan will play for the Dooley Oil Classic in about 30 minutes
7310 2018-06-24 22:21:49 Brent has collapsed 1.6% already
7311 2018-06-24 22:21:45 On 1) The energy used to make an elec vehicle is potentially the same as any other vehicle, so that's a moot point. The car also still contains plastics (oil) and all the parts in the glbl supply chain are moved just as they are for any other vehicle with, you guessed it: oil.
7312 2018-06-24 22:21:38 9ja which way na. When you want to get fuel in this country now you have to get down from your car & crack a joke or two with the fuel attendant, ask about their family members and their favorite sport.

7313 2018-06-24 22:21:37 Fry the cockroach until it is brown and crispy.

7315 2018-06-24 22:21:23 Fried Roach:

First, put the cockroach in a plastic, sealable baggie and put it in the freezer for 5 minutes (to ensure the cockroach is dead).
Wash the cockroach and dry it on a sheet or paper towel.
Heat a frying pan with some olive oil.
7316 2018-06-24 22:21:23 To be fair, a worldwide recession; with stock markets tumbling, commodity prices all over & oil at record prices would fit into one of one's forecasts; would push world economy in a direction one wants, away from traditional banking. Good vs Evil; it is that simple, what is life?

7318 2018-06-24 22:21:20 Achievements are not yours but as a result of others.  Without oil you are just camel crap, nothing more. Look at Saudi Arabia in 1950s. You had nothing.  Just a backward culture and lazy people. Everything was built by foreigners.
7319 2018-06-24 22:21:20 Well, now to find a different solution. I’m going to try #TeeTree oil  & shampoo next

7322 2018-06-24 22:21:03 Because clearly, we need more oil in our oceans.
7323 2018-06-24 22:21:02 Beard oil and/or balm needed... see above ... 
7324 2018-06-24 22:20:43 Some stir fry would do well in coconut oil (cold press, virgin) with onions, sweet peppers, scotchy, tomatoes (sufficiently heated to release anti-oxidants, not soppy though), likkle rosemary, scellion.... Just wonderful!
7325 2018-06-24 22:20:07 I hope you are right. But for your information  saddam was actually supproted from USSR and had problems with US and coalition.
The reason that people were celebrating was that they were free from years of sanctions named as "Oil for food" which crippled the country economy.
7326 2018-06-24 22:19:58 I long for oil paint and canvas..
7327 2018-06-24 22:19:32 Plus, this is hurting oil drilling as pipe and everything are made of steel, driving up the cost per well in the US by almost 20%. I worked rigs when I was younger and my buddies are complaining now. So we buy more foreign oil

7339 2018-06-24 22:17:26 i have the same problem but i find that products with natural ingredients are really good, tea tree oil especially. also only wash your face once a day instead of twice, i don’t care what anyone says, washing your face excessively isn’t beneficial

7368 2018-06-24 22:12:15 The base Evora motor is very close to the Camry motor. They modify the exhaust cams and their sensors, add an oil cooler, and put in bigger injectors along with their ECU so it is probably easier to modify the Camry engine to match if you can get the ECU to work.
7369 2018-06-24 22:11:55 So here's the deal. You don't really need all that water. Just put in enough water to cover the pasta and absorb as it cooks. Remember your EVOO. By the end, you should have noodles in a small amount of slightly creamy sauce made from the reduced water, pasta starch, oil, & salt.
7370 2018-06-24 22:11:49 Without the IMF the country stared bankruptcy in the face in 1970s. Statutory pay freeze, rampant inflation, falling living standards and a £ that had halved in value against Deutschmark in 10 years. We were called the sick man of Europe. Rescued by N Sea oil and the EU market.
7371 2018-06-24 22:11:47 POS does not care about Flint or any other American City or person that gets in the way of his agenda. Big Oil is taking over and that is why all of this BS is going on. Petrocurrency is all they care about. Big Oil & Corporations run USA & the world.
7372 2018-06-24 22:11:14 Well, you are in the oil business so I guess there are disappointments in both sides of the border. NO PIPELINE!!!!!!
7373 2018-06-24 22:11:09 Coal and oil are most def  going to run out and frankly there are other sources of renables that will change that paradigm in the near future.thats a given but for now economies run on the cheap and plentiful supply which was incidentally created by nature

7403 2018-06-24 22:07:08 This man @ELEGBETE1 has a YouTube channel where he probably states nonsensical non-fact and easily disproved lies that might sound as stupid as his "senegal/Nigeria/oyinbo wall/crude oil" tweet.

Also it’s annoying af but just try to fully remove makeup and wash your face every night, and moisturize afterwords. skincare threads are really helpful if u need cheap products!

7415 2018-06-24 22:05:27 If you define "capitalism" as a system wherein government and large corporations  collude to rig the system, yes, you're correct.  Dont confuse that with free markets or time value of money.  Only government has the monopoly on force.  They're as guilty as any big oil company.
7416 2018-06-24 22:05:17 I feel they tug too hard on the heartstrings. Snapped every last one and now I’m an immovable force against all emotional arguments.
7417 2018-06-24 22:04:52 We had nazis march in Charlotte. He called some of them very fine people. Learn from history or be doomed to repeat it. You blindly follow a snake oil salesman and refuse to admit that you were lied to. Get your facts straight.
7418 2018-06-24 22:04:51 Is SC & ECP creating a job for themselves, post elections? There will be challenges to the understated assets. Why is Chief justice more worried about oil prices than Declarations? Priorities?
7419 2018-06-24 22:04:45 If you use body oil/baby oil, do you put it on in the shower or when you dry off?

7422 2018-06-24 22:03:59 Irving imports OPEC BECAUSE not enough Can, Oil.  EE to supply the Irving refinery with West Can. Oil for refining so no/less OPEC + US oil trains like Megantic. Need more capacity than #9.  Politicians/Enviro lobby (Foreigned funded) blocked EE.  Just like BC/Envriro blocks TM.
7423 2018-06-24 22:03:47 Leaving the spa felt like taking a walk of shame - my makeup is smeared, my hair has massage oil in it, and I'm acting a little drunk.

7429 2018-06-24 22:03:19 Ahh but we have no problem paying for unnecessary wars such as the invasion of Iraq . We are setting up for another one in Niger. And we do this to maintain an alreDy bloated military. Maybe we should send  troops into ElSavador and Hondouras. But we won’t because there is no oil
7430 2018-06-24 22:03:18 God has blessed this nation so much that we are self sufficient. We don't need any products from any country including oil. In a few years the U.S. will export more oil than import. There is no reason for the U.S. to be taken advantage of unless it is because of the politicians.

7434 2018-06-24 22:01:55 Ugh.... trying to season my cast iron griddle and managed to fumble the oil bottle and managed to coat the pan, my oven mit and the floor.  Now the dog is trying to lick up the microscopic layer of oil on my floor!
7435 2018-06-24 22:01:55 Iran tried to use blocking increase of oil production with higher prices as a result as leverage in its negotiations with EU over JCPOA. They just took this trumpcard out of Irans hand. Small but significant
7436 2018-06-24 22:01:53 Cost can be paid by bringing our oil to tidewater and selling it at world prices and not to the US at a $30/barrel discount.
7437 2018-06-24 22:01:25 This ocean thing that trump is doing should be a concern to even people outside the US. Imagine another great oil spill! That’s a potential harm to the Gulf of Mexico and to the Caribbean waters and our mean of living but we should all suffer for one man and his greed right?
7438 2018-06-24 22:01:08 I have just landed having returned from a very important, however don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
7439 2018-06-24 22:01:08 Claude & Del? We make an Italian ammoglio w/garlic, sea salt, fresh basil, a blanched tomato, olive oil & a tiny bit of water & ground pepper. You can put that on anything you grill, during or afterwards & it tastes incredible

7446 2018-06-24 22:00:48 After selling millions of acres of national parks to oil companies, why would Americans trust you with the fishing industry? This is the most corrupt administration ever in America, and you should be ashamed of yourselves!!
7447 2018-06-24 22:00:37 Essential oils are very concentrated plant extracts.

For instance a single drop of peppermint essential oil is equivalent to 28 cups of peppermint tea.

7451 2018-06-24 21:59:46 If oil is so bad, why do you keep using it? Could you survive without oil? I would argue the answer is no.

7456 2018-06-24 21:58:56 I think it is a mistake to view Mother Earth as endlessly renewable. We are supposed to be safeguarding her for next generations, not pillaging every tree or drop of oil, for example.
7457 2018-06-24 21:58:52 So, lets *use* this, not pumping up all that oil. And there is more, much more in electricity: check out the real Tesla!
7458 2018-06-24 21:58:45 Wild thyme is a potent antimicrobial and antibacterial essential oil. Add a few drops while cleaning. Diffusing lemon helps to neutralize cooking aromas and purify the air

7496 2018-06-24 21:51:51 @JoshManMode  I gave my dog some of the CBD oil and his eyes are like bloodshot and he doesn't want to do anything but eat and chill out.  Is that normal?
7497 2018-06-24 21:51:22 hmm there was a similar drop here.  Could have made it there in the light I suppose.  But very slick and single track.
Foodwise - this was the opposite.. it was very sweet-heavy. The bread and tomato with oil was good!  No melon!

7503 2018-06-24 21:50:27 You're right, after OPEC led the charge for its partners to stop producing so much oil to end the market glut back in 2015 I think it was, prices have continued to rise.
7504 2018-06-24 21:50:26 The last time I took my golden retriever to the groomer, they said she was difficult and nervous, and that next appointment they would give her a treat CBD oil. I guess it’s a thing now.  Have to research it, or change groomers I guess.

7519 2018-06-24 21:46:27 A lot of people. Mostly CBD oil tho, it helps with arthritis and inflammation. I use it with my chronic illnesses (the one with no THC tho).
7520 2018-06-24 21:46:12 A great place to star gaze is in Escalante National Monument.  You know, the place 45 gutted so he could make some money off his cronies. Better go soon before the oil and fracking sites light up the night sky.
7521 2018-06-24 21:45:55 As I mostly work in watercolour, I tend to toss as fixes usually make it worse. But acrylic and oil have forgiven many a slip. Leave it but don’t lose it:)
7522 2018-06-24 21:45:53 Ignore the guy telling you to eat cream. Olive oil is your friend. Plenty of other good sources of fat
7523 2018-06-24 21:45:41 So let me get this straight you want tariffs off and yet you just put one on  others how bout the 20$ a barrel  rebate of oil we give u should we charge you same as the standard  how bout a 1.50 a gallon rise in gas prices bring it on love Canada

7527 2018-06-24 21:45:01 I literally just anointed my house with cooking oil with Rita on speaker praying all spirits out and opened the door to let them out because I've been having a weird vibe lately.  She is a true angel on earth. I feel better and love my mama.
7528 2018-06-24 21:44:50 1時49分～5時で途中Twitterしたりぐらぶるしたりしたから実際3時間もかからずにやったとおもうとわたしほんと頑張ったわ…………まあイベ初日からこつこつやってれはいまこんなふうに焦る必要なかったんですけどね
7529 2018-06-24 21:44:48 Learned this trick of freezing herbs in olive oil to preserve them. Idk if it’ll work for chilies. Will definitely try it.
7530 2018-06-24 21:44:44 What oil did you get? And how many mg of cbd
7531 2018-06-24 21:44:24 Oil money + satellite link.
7532 2018-06-24 21:44:14 Does anyone know of any cbd oil that doesn’t haven’t thc in it?
7533 2018-06-24 21:44:01 European politicians are bought and paid for with Russian oil money.
7534 2018-06-24 21:43:28 Do robots pee oil or gasoline?
7535 2018-06-24 21:43:27 A lot of people gives Trump the credit for the economic expansion... but it seems like the dollar is playing a quite important role. Strong oil is perhaps another one.
7536 2018-06-24 21:43:25 Glitter and body oil? Hell Yeah!
7537 2018-06-24 21:43:25 this hydrating coconut oil by marc anthony lol
7538 2018-06-24 21:43:11 Also, how do they justify repealing an order to protect the oceans from oil spills? How do they justify any of this shit they're enabling?
7539 2018-06-24 21:43:10 young liberal writer spouts off w/o facts.  Her desire 4 continuous validation via social media w little regard of consequences is reckless behavior that sadly has been reinforced n taught to her probably in every school attended. Victim? I think not. Adult? Not sure. Sad? Yes
7540 2018-06-24 21:43:07 We “invaded” their land, steal  their gold, oil, lumber, rubber, ‘exotic’ animals, destroying the environment in the process, depose their leaders, destabilizing their govts, scream “aMuRiKuH iS tHe gReAtEsT cUnTrY oN eArTh” and you still can’t figure out why they come here.
7541 2018-06-24 21:43:06 Wow. Sounds....summery.

Perfect for a disgusting nonhuman. 

We'll have him on the first oil spill tanker out...as soon as possible. 

Thank you so much for the recommendation.

7542 2018-06-24 21:42:47 It's mandatory;
President Trump must impose a 35% remittance tax to all US remittances going to Mexico. Mexican economy first source of income are US remittances above oil, mining, agriculture...Mexico as a country can't survive without US remittances........
Retweet & share !!!
7543 2018-06-24 21:42:38 I am so very mad at what is happening with rainforests. There are people fed up with the oil companies stomping on anyone in their way. 
   There is no respect oil companies give to what already exists. The rainforests belong to everyone.
7544 2018-06-24 21:42:34 I have so many years of heat damage in my hair. The Dominicans messed me up, the perms I got, hot oil treatments and straightening with no protection 
7545 2018-06-24 21:42:32 いやでもまじでわたし頑張ってると思うんですよ、32個しか達成してなかったのに正式加入までいったんですよいやあ私頑張ってるわあ(自賛)
7546 2018-06-24 21:42:23 As you get in your oil burning car to go home!
7547 2018-06-24 21:42:21 To attract investment you need a credible plan. Being "monetarily sovereign" is nowhere near enough.
Inward investment to UK has almost ceased due to perception of Brexit as damaging.
Being monetarily sovereign (& having diamond, gold, oil assets) didnt help Zimbabwe or Venezuela
7548 2018-06-24 21:42:15 Thank you for sharing your story and advocating for TBI & CTE.  My son also obtained a TBI over 9 yrs ago and has shown great improvement with CBD Oil in only a few short months.
7549 2018-06-24 21:42:06 Okay, but you must take into account that technology has improved dramatically over the last few years. It’s a completely different game, unconventional production is really challenging conventional production and is why US has taken market share in the world’s oil & gas market.
7550 2018-06-24 21:41:51 Conozco un pana que le compra unas pastillas a un señor colombiano que allá cuesta 130 mil pesos y acá 5 millones de la tensión y no es que allá es todo barato pues?
7551 2018-06-24 21:41:47 Buck: Back in my day, there was no information available on these West Coast guys. All we could do was simply stare at the various oil paintings of the players that were hanging in the clubhouse and hope for the best.

Pat: Big, strong brush strokes.

Buck: Nolan Ryan.
7552 2018-06-24 21:41:42 So I was at hurricane harbor and as I was pouring baby oil on myself, my mom noticed this man that was sitting more down take his marriage band off and walked over to me and asked me for some bby oil... y’all ain’t shit
7553 2018-06-24 21:41:30 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
7554 2018-06-24 21:41:30 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
7555 2018-06-24 21:41:18 Anybody that has spent a day on a beach in Marbella will tell you it's a nightmare, fake Gucci handbags and pirate CDs are abundant along with the local massage therapist with a bottle of olive oil at the ready it's no laughing matter but true and not racist
7556 2018-06-24 21:41:11 the biggest thing for me is that we can and do work towards making milk production more ethical, but the milk alternatives nearly always contain palm oil, and there's very little we can do about palm oil farming that doesn't destroy rainforest and endanger specieswe can't replace
7557 2018-06-24 21:41:10 Data is oil, data is oil, data is a fascist art gallery or whatever of domestic objects.
7558 2018-06-24 21:41:01 Gullible people. And there’s a snake oil salesmen out there...
7559 2018-06-24 21:41:00 Picked this baby up on Quintessa. Nice folks, the Quintessons. Give you a good deal and... mh.. aaall the oil you can drink.
7560 2018-06-24 21:40:51 Its all about oil. Amazing how usa and uk destabilise a country then kinda secretly finance an opposition, giving usa uk control of such country & raping a country of its financial assets. usa & uk are pirates and are happy to kill innocent men women and children in the process.

7563 2018-06-24 21:40:07 Just a little bit of oil, and... Come on! Come on, you little son of a bitch!
7564 2018-06-24 21:40:05 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
7565 2018-06-24 21:39:42 Michelle is it true Ontario & Quebec women would still rather buy their Tanker Oil/Gasoline from these same Arab Sheiks as well as Venezuela’s Killer Dictator...rather than Canadian Oil via pipeline. Ont & Que women don’t mind countries who treat women like crap. Lady Hypocrisy
7566 2018-06-24 21:39:36 l'huile / oil
7567 2018-06-24 21:39:29 confirmed: leading therapists confirm that once the orange man breathes heavily, a depressed snail assumes he is winning #tiredofwinning
7568 2018-06-24 21:39:28 Don't Republican administrations typically run higher gas prices. Big Oil owns the GOP. The development of renewable energy resources creates competition, reduces fossil fuel consumption, and brings the prices down. Vote Democrat!
7569 2018-06-24 21:38:54 I love seeing wind farms. 1) It means cleaner energy production 2) They aren't ugly like oil rigs and coal mines.
7570 2018-06-24 21:38:40 I was complaining about how bad my cramps were and Cesar went out of his way to buy me massage oil and hair ties cuz he remembered I needed some
7571 2018-06-24 21:38:32 Yes we need oil and we will continue to need oil for many years.  But I want you to think long and hard about the consequences of expanding oil infrastructure.  Business as usual is over. Done. We need to get serious about the transition.
7572 2018-06-24 21:38:30 The lefty one world one gov't type's will suppress anyone and destroy anyone that stands in their way.

By the way, nice to see a train (W.Buffet) derailment with an oilspill resulting. 
Too bad! 
A pipeline wouldn't have spilled oil(only by ecoterrorists aka The Left).
7573 2018-06-24 21:38:24 Cars that don't need motor oil 
7574 2018-06-24 21:38:08 That Peak Oil record is so lovely, looking forward to digging into the catalog
7575 2018-06-24 21:38:08 Governor Assbbitte has given them tax breaks to refine the oil, but hey don't let things like facts get in the way of your stupidity.
7576 2018-06-24 21:38:08 Plants are able to heal our bodies DNA when we are grounded with them for periods of times. The electric energy being pulled from the body into the grounds works as if you would get your oil changed in your car. RePlace stagnant energy with fresh energy into the body
7577 2018-06-24 21:37:57 6 Oz's of Cookie Glue Trim to 60 oz's of coconut oil been cooking for 5hrs!!! Cant wait to make my own chocolates!!!!
7578 2018-06-24 21:37:53 drink water, eat your veggies, mind your business and put grapeseed oil on everything.

7579 2018-06-24 21:37:52 For soup, cook ground scallions in oil, then simmer with lentils, oregano, mushroom broth and red peppers. Top with pesto.
7580 2018-06-24 21:37:10 oil and gas
7581 2018-06-24 21:37:08 Never use olive oil to tan huns, you will burn the weirdest shapes all over
7582 2018-06-24 21:37:07 oil of every pearl's un-insides, nasty by rico nasty second
7583 2018-06-24 21:36:57 Vitamin e oil feels really good under your eyes
7584 2018-06-24 21:36:34 Coconut oil is honestly my life savour: Need to moisturise ? Coconut oil. Dry hair? Coconut oil. Cooking a stir fry? Coconut oil. And today’s discovery... mouth ulcer? Coconut oil!
7585 2018-06-24 21:36:30 Tesla needs a high valuation to compete with Chinese gov funded EV companies such as CATL. They get virtually free unlimited funds. Tesla cannot be acquired by big oil or old auto and shut down.
7586 2018-06-24 21:36:29 Ive been getting cash kickbacks from Russian oil companies for just as long.

7590 2018-06-24 21:35:24 To be fair, you should also call them oil products, as I'm sure a lot of their calories were also from oil.
7591 2018-06-24 21:35:17 Well, I am in Québec and have no issue with oil/gas in general. Fracking, I am not a fan. I have the feeling that water will have more value than oil in the future and fracking might result in contamination of water sources. Basically, I do not like breaking the ground I live on.
7592 2018-06-24 21:35:17 Oil is bad for people, the environment and the economy. Huge opportunity cost. We need to move away from it as quickly as possible.
7593 2018-06-24 21:34:24 tsina is not known for their medical technology and / or expertise. maybe for traditional chinese medicine. yung mga snake oil. fried scorpions. ells' blood, etc.
7594 2018-06-24 21:34:15 Please, @SenatorLankford couldn’t find his own hand two inches from his face—unless it was covered in oil or the #Kochbrothers tell him it’s there. #SenLurch is an imbecile. An embarrassment to #Oklahoma
7595 2018-06-24 21:34:13 Babe changed my battery and oil in my bike for me 
7596 2018-06-24 21:33:50 Pro cyclists soak cotton wool in olbas oil then stuff it up their noses to help open their airways in case you're looking for a last resort!
7597 2018-06-24 21:33:25 Also, if you think the government needs fixing, why support Trump? Its clear he's hell bent of dismantling anything meaningful that been achieved in the last decade. Even right now he's literally just undone a bill that protecs oceans from Oil Spills
7598 2018-06-24 21:33:23 Background: Comes from Edo period hair oil salesmen who took their time chitchatting with the customers when selling.
7599 2018-06-24 21:33:14 And for the record i didnt vote for Bush both times, he got us into a war that we had no business other than oil.
7600 2018-06-24 21:33:10 One question: If I had to change either home insulation (passivhaus standard) OR change the way I warm my home, which one would be more ecofriendly?

Cause for one option I would use up more energy, at a lesser env impact. For the other, little energy but using oil.
7601 2018-06-24 21:32:55 °ºнaĦº..I will come knocking at your door soon, this time.. to borrow some Ijebu garri, oil, 3 cubes of sugar and catfish.

7603 2018-06-24 21:32:50 Okay so this girl told me to not put oil in it until you unravel them. And when your twisting you should see the product and ever since my braid outs been poppin
7604 2018-06-24 21:32:33 Math doesnt add up. We are making enough of our own oil but we still pay $3.00 a gallon. Either you are a bold face liar or you and your GOP cronies are ripping off all Americans!
7605 2018-06-24 21:32:31 EB Hwy43 at Hwy757, east of Mayerthorpe, crack sealing work complete. Fresh oil on the hwy. (3:32pm) #ABRoads

7607 2018-06-24 21:32:04 I wished it healed autism like cannabis oil does.  The disabled have been protesting for years and no one listens to us.  NOTHING stops autism but cannabis oil.  I'm tired of being put on anti-depressants that make everything a living hell.
7608 2018-06-24 21:32:03 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
7609 2018-06-24 21:31:53 5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. - Psalm 23:5
7610 2018-06-24 21:31:41 Yes, give weed to your pets. CBD oil gave my old dog the ability to walk again in a single day
7611 2018-06-24 21:31:34 Based on the spices, I’d recommend chicken or beef, thin strip cuts rather than either minced  Both are pretty typical subs. I can’t imagine turkey but if you love it, go for it. I like chili oil but also think sesame oil would taste good as would a fresh sambal. enjoy!!
7612 2018-06-24 21:31:32 Caller Tammy Midwell, Bently, AB: I had a roommate who switched from the oil fields to elder care. He saw problems with care. He was promoted to a dementia ward. Bathing once a week was if you were lucky. He worked 12 hour shifts, 10 days on, 4 days off.

7614 2018-06-24 21:31:07 I put olive oil on my avocado toast with red pepper flakes
7615 2018-06-24 21:31:04 Oh fuck yeah coocnut oil. How have you found E45 cream for your skin? Recently been using a mix of it and arnica for some stubborn acne with some pretty nice results!
7616 2018-06-24 21:30:19 As good as Hawaiian Tropic. Maybe add some  oil
7617 2018-06-24 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
7618 2018-06-24 21:30:12 oil pulling!!! coconut oil works super well
7619 2018-06-24 21:29:52 I just covered my whole body in coconut oil now I'm drinking an ice cold glass of water with a slice of lemon and I'm actually excited for my breakfast of sunflower seeds and a banana....and I'm more excited for the fact I'm going to the gym in the morning?

7621 2018-06-24 21:29:43 and why is export bad? Especially when the export means that the oil used in PADD 5 is moved more safely, recognizing that we share an ecosystem with them.
7622 2018-06-24 21:29:35 Are you implying pipelines don’t ever leak oil?

7625 2018-06-24 21:28:56 Started doing pore strips recently. Often have eczema patches across the rest of my face, so keep the main steps really gentle. Lots of coconut oil.
7626 2018-06-24 21:28:55 Good to know, and then the UN does feck all in case it upsets SA and oil prices
7627 2018-06-24 21:28:54 Jk I didn't roll em but played in a charity tournament yesterday and I can barely move. My joints need an oil change.

7629 2018-06-24 21:28:20 I usually exhaust myself playing games and alex stays in a call with me when i go to bed to keep an eye on me. Yeah i use lavender oil on my pillow 
7630 2018-06-24 21:28:04 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
7631 2018-06-24 21:27:54 Very moving: but done by 32 yr old Crown Prince for economic reasons and leaving protesters in gaol. Saudi Arabia at least two centuries behind the rest of the work. Hope they run out of oil soon/ world finds alternatives to oil- wch is already happening.

Why'd you blindside loyal customers? BTW alternative brands (no shade) don't work for everyone. #makeup 
7634 2018-06-24 21:27:31 Garlic, olive oil and cayenne is the default italian "lazy spaghetti". Also great after a night of drinking.
7635 2018-06-24 21:27:28 I wouldnt go overboard but possibly add creatine and fish oil. Magnesium if you are going hard enough that cramping starts become an issue. Definitely some sort of food or protein shake post workout.
7636 2018-06-24 21:27:05 I did just change the plug recently, but they're cheap enough to get. As for oil, it's a two stroke with automatic premixer, doubt oil is an issue since it's meant to burn
7637 2018-06-24 21:27:04 Let's just nationalize the oil industry. I'm sick of them.

7652 2018-06-24 21:24:20 Mr. Steak- Y is it that AB is so very whiny? Why does AB never seem 2B able to understand EQ? Y was AB not able to understand that the plunge in World Oil Prices was not controlled by Notley? Y is AB who is doing best economically of ALL provinces the whiniest?
7653 2018-06-24 21:24:13 Call me troll if you want but your call on gold, oil and ng have been wrong. Your call on the S&P was good, up then sideways. Not sure why you need to pat yourself on the back. I follow you because I get a nice laugh from your tweets.
7654 2018-06-24 21:23:47 Me: wearing a cut-off lynyrd skynyrd shirt w cut-off jean shorts drinking a Coors drenched in coolant and oil 

My dad: why

7659 2018-06-24 21:22:28 the heavy shinobi in sonic mania probably got my number the most of any boss (four deaths in press garden, at least two on his phase of the final boss). oil ocean's boss is easy if you know to jump off the platforms when they're about to be pulled down.
7660 2018-06-24 21:22:02 Oil marketers won’t allow that to happen,everything happening About the power supply and tariffs on solar panel can be traced to them .
7661 2018-06-24 21:21:34 Not only that Katie, see damage she has done to our economy in less than a year.   Eg, stops oil and gas exploration for no other reason than she wanted something to say when in Europe, made without notice, no consultation and no cost benefit analysis and ignoring all prof advice
7662 2018-06-24 21:21:27 So, you "don't have a problem" with violating the U.S. Constitution. Thanks for clarifying. Google "14th amendment" and "due process."
7663 2018-06-24 21:21:21 she can do as she likes even after selling us her snake oil about referendum , so the system is broken she is not represebtive of the people whom elected her? Then might as well return to absolute monarchy
7664 2018-06-24 21:21:20 Are you sure? I see no correlation between oil and gold

7667 2018-06-24 21:20:34 On top of her sketchy CBD oil for dogs, she is literally the queen of unethical, let alone herself as a white woman making a ton of money from something poc get locked up for life for should also be a red flag. This was never about the law or permits.
7668 2018-06-24 21:20:12 "One of the most valuable voices on the right"

What a dumb statement.  He is a snake oil salesmen that had a run where he stumbled into the right answer.  

So you think Glenn Beck has a healthier view of conservatism than Trump?  Get bent.
7669 2018-06-24 21:19:58 EYEBROWS :
Apply a mix of coconut oil,almond oil and castor oil  every night before bed .This mix will make your eyebrows grow within two weeks .Or u can yse vaselina or anything else
7670 2018-06-24 21:19:55 Pineapple makes my toungue tingle though. 
Frozen mango is good too. 

We recently bought a crate of tomatoes. I’m thinking of freezing some of the surplus. Tesco’s sell them. Oven semi dried with thyme and oil have been amazing.
7671 2018-06-24 21:19:32 Been using castor oil on my lashes and brows for a week and i already feel like they are fuller!!
7672 2018-06-24 21:19:09 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
7673 2018-06-24 21:19:07 I use it too for my condition. Every painkiller omitted due to the oil is a godsend for the liver too!

7676 2018-06-24 21:18:52 Probably easier to just interpret what they said before Vienna. Saudis like idea of $80 oil.

7681 2018-06-24 21:18:41 Sameee, i started using tea tree oil cause a lot of people said it was really good. But it actually made my skin worse
7682 2018-06-24 21:18:27 “The grease keeps me young,” I tell myself, as I bring three oil absorbing sheets to full transparency.

I want her NOW!!!!!
7685 2018-06-24 21:17:58 Hmmm... not quite sure what you are looking for as fracking is not and never has been the issue at Biscathorpe. It's very much an ordinary oil prospect.
7686 2018-06-24 21:17:46 You guys, something went wrong. You forgot to praise Fearless Leader in this tweet. The propaganda machine may need more oil.
7687 2018-06-24 21:17:45 there's probably some oil money at issue as well
7688 2018-06-24 21:17:38 Just deep fried my credit card in peanut oil instead of canola oil, hoping it might slim-down the monthly payment.
7689 2018-06-24 21:17:31 Oil, like the diffuser Trisha gave me.
7690 2018-06-24 21:17:27 It’s mainly palm oil - there’s a gross picture online of what’s in it 
7691 2018-06-24 21:17:23 The SNP make a lot of funny claims ,I remember the last Indy vote they claimed that oil would finance Scotland. Then oil plummeted.
To 26 dollars
Duh
7692 2018-06-24 21:17:05 My apologies. Had I known you were having a shower head installed I would have checked myself much sooner. Be well, and have a great shower!
7693 2018-06-24 21:17:03 Sounds like a ignition issue to my inexperienced mind. If it's ideling but struggling to pull, perhaps the plugs are a good place to start? That or perhaps a gasket gas blown somewhere so oil is getting to places it shouldn't?

7698 2018-06-24 21:15:52 Actually more Americans smartly voted against the snake oil salesmen. He use classic techniques like gaslighting to convince his captives that what he is saying is the truth.The truth is he is a liar that only cares about himself. His ego is number one. This is how fascism begins
7699 2018-06-24 21:15:47 Why do you think they didn’t bring enough oil to last until the coming of the Bridegroom?

7702 2018-06-24 21:15:10 It's oil that I use in my diffuser. The ones I use are pure plant essence, so no man-made chemicals. I can't speak for any other types.
7703 2018-06-24 21:15:08 After the war they rebuilt to be more accommodating of cars, but still, cars were largely restricted to the upper class, taxis, & service vehicles. Europe produced little oil, and most of the oil it did produce was in the USSR & Romania. They also didn't have the space for cars.

7705 2018-06-24 21:14:51 #Russia is heading for a crash. Why? Because despite #Putin's preening & posturing his kleptocracy has no economic strategy once oil/gas/raw materials run out. No other sectors of econ being developed or worth a mention.
7706 2018-06-24 21:14:41 LOL. I think you been sniffing the oil fumes a little too long in Bakersfield. Your post of selective outrage. That's a joke. What's not a joke is Obama handing children over to traffickers and the left doesn't have outrage for that. That's selective outrage.

7712 2018-06-24 21:13:47 Why is it that I can't make pancakes without burning myself or destroying my leg? There was a bit of oil splash from flipping the pancake.

I dodged. Twisted my ankle in the process.

7720 2018-06-24 21:13:00 I wouldn’t be so hard on Quebec if they were pro oil/gas, you can’t take Alberta’s money and protect pipelines and fracking. That just makes zero sense.
7721 2018-06-24 21:12:58 You realize Trump is an entertainer right? An elitist snake oil salesmen making money at the expense of tax payers. Keep defending your Hollywood prez.

7731 2018-06-24 21:11:50 Crude oil

The law of Entropy, second law of thermodynamics, says that crude oil at $70 makes Saudi imports very expensive.

7733 2018-06-24 21:11:13 Dubya the Dummy Bush helped make Obama President!  His foreign policy was good because he had good people like Dick Cheney running it!  His domestic policy of free trade was as successful as the sports team and oil company he tried to run that failed!  Republicans remember 2008!
7734 2018-06-24 21:11:11 (I guess the nature of the fish oil's impact would depend largely on brand & capsule quality.)
7735 2018-06-24 21:11:08 But wages are stagnant. Gas and oil prices up majorly. Blue states(those who support red states) lost real estate deductions. I am spending more under this president. Plus, you lie. All of you, all the time.
7736 2018-06-24 21:11:05 It’s not about taking offence, it’s just a bit too general when you consider people like Idi Amin, Pol Pot and various members of the head-choppin oil royalty. Barack Obama also presided over many evil acts in the Middle East resulting in millions of dead or displaced civilians.
7737 2018-06-24 21:11:01 Quote of the weekend, me. “I’m just away in to oil my sausages”
7738 2018-06-24 21:10:56 He is part of the conspiracy theorists who believe there is a secret plot by scientists to shift the global power of oil into their hands....it’s fucking laughable 
7739 2018-06-24 21:10:49 The detergent in bubble bath removes you natural skin oil barriers and exposes you to damaging molecules that cause eczema! This is NOT cute, but thoughtlessness. Sorry to have to tell the truth about bubble bath! 
7740 2018-06-24 21:10:41 And using propaganda picture mixing oil into the gas Disgusting
7741 2018-06-24 21:10:32 Oil soaked plantain is one of the most appalling foods to look at.

Best of luck
7749 2018-06-24 21:09:17 No, Sarah. I really think you do not!
7750 2018-06-24 21:09:12 I believe the person who invented the oil drill got the inspiration by watching birds peck the ground
7751 2018-06-24 21:08:48 What about bumping up your daily intake of fish oil & vitamin D?
7752 2018-06-24 21:08:43 I’m allllll about that argan oil 
7753 2018-06-24 21:08:31 That will take some time to develop, and until then we will still need oil for transportation, heat and medical procedures. We can’t turn off the tap now, it will take a while...
7754 2018-06-24 21:08:18 Getting my oil changed and I’ve never felt more intimidated in my life
7755 2018-06-24 21:08:17 That's how the whole blowup happened,  my son had made some microwave popcorn and left the box on the table. It is in Dutch but contains popcorn, palm oil, and salt.

Seems pretty ok, got me blocked though.  

I do have a personal peeve about people who think chemicals are bad.

7757 2018-06-24 21:07:49 Here is the list of everything Rick Scott has done for Florida’s Environment!                                                          Zero                                                            Vote Bill Nelson to keep oil rigs off of Florida Coasts and Rick Scott out of DC
7758 2018-06-24 21:07:42 To be fair, gas went up because Iran Deal was killed, taking Iranian oil out of US consumption. But don’t worry. Drilling oil in the oceans again will bring prices back down again.......
7759 2018-06-24 21:07:01 lol it’s just a super complicated problem

wars will be fought over freshwater (globally), so we should definitely prevent that from ever happening in America... because if it were oil — multiple pipelines would’ve already been built by now 
7760 2018-06-24 21:06:55 Dealerships have the best oil.
7761 2018-06-24 21:06:32 Followed all these fantastic Trump supporters 
7762 2018-06-24 21:06:25 WOW NOW THAT IS A BIG DEAL. He defininitely needs to be put in a hot vat of oil for that right.   RIDICULOUS.
7763 2018-06-24 21:06:08 Lol. 
7764 2018-06-24 21:05:58 I could eat a whole Harris oil pizza rn
7765 2018-06-24 21:05:42 Who wants to change the oil in my car?
7766 2018-06-24 21:05:37 I am 62 years old. You don't know what policies I did or did not support during the Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, GHW Bush, Clinton, GW Bush or Obama Administrations. I know my own history. You don't.
7767 2018-06-24 21:05:33 Gas should be $1.20 a gallon and no more then that. Look at the gas prices back when a barrel of oil was the highest it’s ever been and it was around 1.20-1.70! Now when a barrel drops the prices keep going up WHY???? We have been getting robbed for decades with gas prices!!!!!
7768 2018-06-24 21:05:30 I need to change my oil but I’m too lazy. y am I like dis
7769 2018-06-24 21:05:29 Like you doctor?

7770 2018-06-24 21:05:17 Ibuprofen, hot shower, peppermint oil, masturbation. Works every time.
7771 2018-06-24 21:05:09 The ONLY thing about weed I don’t like is the smell of the THC oil. Especially the ones in the cartridges
7772 2018-06-24 21:05:08 I’m such a product person. In the shower i gotta have shampoo, conditioner, hair mask, face wash, body wash, shaving cream, baby oil, foot scrub, body scrub, exfoliating brush. I want it all lmao
7773 2018-06-24 21:05:08 If you have to steal essential oils, eye liner, a pregnancy test, and a king size reese’s cup from Walmart, please seek help. That rosemary and lavender oil won’t be fixing this mess.
7774 2018-06-24 21:04:43 @notch You should try cooking with sesame oil and oyster sauce.
7775 2018-06-24 21:04:29 Before bed I wash my face with cold water, then apply carrot seed oil and cocoa butter, in the AM I wash with cold water and just apply the cocoa butter, then through the day apply cocoa butter as needed
7776 2018-06-24 21:04:23 Lol I don't wear boxers ooo 
Thank God
7777 2018-06-24 21:04:09 Liberalism is optimism my friend. I mean in essence. Anyway Nigeria has almost as much oil as the Qatar, Mexico and Ecuador combined without the corruption they would have been doing much better
7778 2018-06-24 21:04:06 Yeah, I may be wrong but I've never heard of cbd oil benefiting pets.
7779 2018-06-24 21:04:02 Attn Twitters followers:  IF U hav ability to watch @OANN Pearson Sharp is on NOW 4:00 PM CST about conflict in Syria and White helmets that help only terrorist & oil that is bought from ISIS giving them 2 kill innocents.  We need to ???MSM, corps, gov’ts
7780 2018-06-24 21:03:45 You are laughing out loud, but you are not capable of understanding humor..I’m confused?
7781 2018-06-24 21:03:42 #cbdoil  I would like to know all the benefits of CBD oil.  My friend said she going to buy to see if it really works for anxiety:)
7782 2018-06-24 21:03:42 nie zdążymy, ZUS zajmie się naszym portfelem szybciej niż my zdążymy zaprotestować, mają cały tabun urzędników do tego
7783 2018-06-24 21:03:15 Or they could just introduce pay before you pump which has been in existence for ages but the oil companies won’t do it because they want you to walk into the shop & buy more crap. They’d rather waste police time & use the cops as debt collectors instead of taking responsibility
7784 2018-06-24 21:03:15 Third place game of Dooley Oil Classic started about 10 minutes ago. That means the championship game between Laramie and Fort Morgan likely won’t start until around 5 pm or so. I’ll have further updates as the 3rd place game moves forward
7785 2018-06-24 21:02:57 I also had to cut wheat, eggs, and coconut, and a lot of vegan cheese and dairy options have coconut oil in them.
7786 2018-06-24 21:02:55 I think it's a bit confusing.  CBD Oil is legal and my understanding is that it doesn't contain any THC. However cannabis oil is illegal as it does contain THC and hence why it was confiscated ?.
7787 2018-06-24 21:02:49 The best lip mask is 
   honey, olive oil and sugar.

Mix it up.
Rub it on your lip and it gets all the dead skin off. 

Fuck a lip mask from Sephora shit don’t work

7790 2018-06-24 21:02:28 This is a great story for the american soldiers thinking they were fighting for liberty and democracy while the govt make this mascarade to plant pipeline for oil and arm some "rebels" to kill people all around to not knowing and securise their investment. Satan bless america
7791 2018-06-24 21:02:22 Rinse with olive oil, Doctor T
7792 2018-06-24 21:02:19 I'm having a fun time with it.
7793 2018-06-24 21:01:56 #TullowOil reports this Wednesday, kick starting some useful insights in my view on the impact #Brent strength will have had in Quarter 2 for the sector. #oil #brent #energy #ftse #stocks
7794 2018-06-24 21:01:17 I also crisped up the skin with olive oil, onion salt and pepper. the "shove it in a bag" method is surprisingly effective!
7795 2018-06-24 21:01:15 ppl say you are in ND. I am aware of this. just a mile from Manitoba. my home is Chicago.I'll be back.the oil jobs, and money is here.. big money
7796 2018-06-24 21:01:07 I won't go on my knees to ask #Yorubas to #SupportBiafranReferendum. They pride themselves as intelligent people but revel in ignorance prompted by #Fulani's oil cake inducement. If they are as civil & humane as they claim to be then they should be ashamed of #OneNigeria.

7798 2018-06-24 21:00:39 I also think about reaching out to moderates -instead of preaching to the choir -about rebutting Dem ideas, and on second amendment issues. I constantly told people in 2016 that dems WILL take away 2nd amendment rights if able - citing cases like D.C. vs Heller-a 5-4 vote
7799 2018-06-24 21:00:34 Body oil gel >> lotion.
7800 2018-06-24 21:00:19 WHAT IS THE HYPE ABOUT COCONUT OIL?? I don’t underaSTAND!!?!?
7801 2018-06-24 21:00:17 Looks like oil prices may get up to something real soon
7802 2018-06-24 21:00:12 The U.S does not have enough oil. It need to be imported from Canada. But trump is doing a good job of screwing all international relations. America first. America will be alone
7803 2018-06-24 21:00:06 June 24, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

7805 2018-06-24 21:00:00 CPK pizzas suck, but I do buy frozen pizzas (I buy the high calorie ones w/low vegetable oil and most bang for buck). Then, I usually add extra cheese, veggies/herbs, and extra virgin olive oil before popping them in the oven. For ~$3, I can eat a ~2000-2500+ calorie meal.
7806 2018-06-24 20:59:38  Oil on the road!
7807 2018-06-24 20:59:36 Engnr U miss the point;  alot of people  say/ or do stuffs but don't really mean it.

7808 2018-06-24 20:59:10 Weekend Comments from Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih: Total OPEC+ oil hike to be closer to 1M B/D than 600k. If Friday's price rise became trend, it would be a concern
7809 2018-06-24 20:59:08 Make no mistake. The groundwork for this immigration purge was laid when oil companies and conservatives won their major battle on 9/11/01.
7810 2018-06-24 20:59:05 Best you go tell Norway that then. As they still seem to be making a rather large amount from the same amount of oil extracted.  Oh and as for education, you seem to be getting your facts from the daily fail 
7811 2018-06-24 20:58:55 Lefura. Olive oil. Nyuku. Masheleng. Imali.
7812 2018-06-24 20:58:35 Ahahahaha amazin, good oil bhutterrd gee
7813 2018-06-24 20:58:34 I'm not on trial here. Separation of children from their parents is also occurring under Trump's "Zero Tolerance" policy. Do you currently oppose any Trump policy, statement or tweet?
7814 2018-06-24 20:58:33 I know these kiddies that have been on TV recently with epilepsy have a small amount of THC thats' why it was confescated at the airport & given to the Home Office. I have heard the oil doesn't work as well with other meds but are you able to ween off meds?
7815 2018-06-24 20:58:03 才馬「お客様っ！！！店内で油田を掘るのは禁止です！！！」

7816 2018-06-24 20:57:50 Oh, they would love this.  And it includes the US navy no longer subsidizing the oil trade by protecting shipping lanes.  Maybe then we will get serious about clean energy
7817 2018-06-24 20:57:24 I’m more concerned about that coconut oil 
7818 2018-06-24 20:57:09 OK. I don't have a large platform. How should we organize - the media is not on our side.
How about using the GOP massive fundraising advantage to get message out w paid radio adverts?
7819 2018-06-24 20:56:57 TELL US ABOUT YOUR CAAAAAAATS
7820 2018-06-24 20:56:55 Look at Syrian History in fact Middle Eastern History Iraq for example didn't exist before WW1 GB wanted Iran's oil but their partner Russia pulled out after their revolution so UK created Iraq & stole their oil YouTube Ray Casagranda on the origins of the Syrian crisis
7821 2018-06-24 20:56:42 Yes, Cuba has significant oil reserves, among the top 25 in the world. It's hard to access because of the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico but production is growing pretty steadily.
7822 2018-06-24 20:56:40 We are net exporters of oil with a lot of exploiting and refining flows going north-south versus east-west. IMHO the oil and pipeline industries couldn't have done a better job of motivating and coordinating opposition had they tried.
7823 2018-06-24 20:56:26 Beard oil is cool and all... but if you forget you have it on and touch your beard.. shit gets annoying real fast.
7824 2018-06-24 20:56:25 Daddy bear  loves oiled up bodies *starts to oil you up from head to toes, tracing, massaging and worshiping all those muscles*
7825 2018-06-24 20:56:06 Bout $2200 on sale for the medium. Plus it is fairly costly to run in terms of electricity and oil changes. Maybe in the next few years I can get one! It’s pay for itself before long w/ my orchard and gardens. Even with sale purchase meats...
7826 2018-06-24 20:56:02 Gets better, @JoyAnnReid. SHE doesn't have the proper licenses for her business: Canibis oil treats for ailing dogs

7828 2018-06-24 20:55:25 If you care about America, then you should use up everyone else's oil first.

(Mostly joking.)
7829 2018-06-24 20:54:54 I just put my tanning oil on laid down, not 3 minutes later the sky was black and pouring the rain.. 
7830 2018-06-24 20:54:53 They use to do that. It was called full service. They would pump your gas, wash your windshield, and check your oil, but it costs more.
7831 2018-06-24 20:54:36 Does anyone know a good place to get an oil change? The last place I went to fucked up my engine
7832 2018-06-24 20:54:30 Hey @roastbeefkimmel I love your curly fries but I have to ask what oil do you do them in?
7833 2018-06-24 20:54:05 You're gonna put that on the union? Okay!!! I watched a union company rake in the money making oil pumps. Company was highly profitable. Non union company buys them out. Moved jobs seas. Highly profitable. No need to move.  After it's to late. Fat cat said???oops!!! We messed up!
7834 2018-06-24 20:54:04 Went to Walmart to get my oil changed... well the guy couldn’t get my hood open. He care and told me he couldn’t get it and they couldn’t change my oil. So I asked if I could come to his bay and see for myself. Well he grabbed me some goggles and I asked for
7835 2018-06-24 20:54:04 who knows
7836 2018-06-24 20:53:58 You miss a racist snake oil salesmen
7837 2018-06-24 20:53:50 If you think what that guy did was hilarious ,I think you should Che k your conscience
7838 2018-06-24 20:53:50 More "rebuilding the trust" there from Labour folks: dismiss differing opinions as 'toss'. Wealth tax, corporate tax hikes, renegotiating oil and gas deals, burning bondholders: every option should have been examining before punishing people who had nothing to do with bank debt.
7839 2018-06-24 20:53:47 i just cleansed my face, put a mud mask on, lathered my face in coco oil but i'm still sad and dunno what i'm doing with life. why is it not working??,,
7840 2018-06-24 20:53:09 What do we have now - mandatory oil spills?
7841 2018-06-24 20:53:08 Man said CBD oil cured his cancer 
7842 2018-06-24 20:52:47 No it isn't Engnr, it's just hilarious !
7843 2018-06-24 20:52:45 Question, what would be the effect on rightsizing the value of the USD if oil & gasoline exports were to be sold in Euros, Yen and Yuan?
7844 2018-06-24 20:52:43 Wait... There's oil in Cuba?
7845 2018-06-24 20:52:22 That just looks so beautiful. I want to cover it in baby oil and just stroke it for hours
7846 2018-06-24 20:52:20 I can tell you I don’t love hearing that the plane engines need oil and that there is paperwork to be done. Like a doctor performing surgery, only tell me what I absolutely HAVE to know.

7852 2018-06-24 20:51:40 Are you putting a finish on it? Elm grain looks beautiful with a bit of oil on it 
7853 2018-06-24 20:51:38 Spec oil is 5w-20, using anything other than that or 0w-30 would probably void the warranty.

(I say this only to show the import of using anything other than the spec. oil. Warranty? What warranty? )
7854 2018-06-24 20:51:37 Let our oil workers drill... they are the best in the world...

7859 2018-06-24 20:51:13 I meant to change my oil the correct way and instead just made all of my car problems worse and now I'm stuck on the side of the road on the interstate.
7860 2018-06-24 20:51:02 Lmao... idk if he serious or not doe... my car needs maintenance and he said he wants to do the oil change
7861 2018-06-24 20:50:50 Low carb is easiest for me. I’ve tried all flavors of dieting and couldn’t make any work until low carb.  Basically meat, eggs, and vegetables with copious amounts of avocados, olive oil, and butter.
7862 2018-06-24 20:50:46 They bought the snake oil,  let it burn going down
7863 2018-06-24 20:50:44 I've never really seen a non-ngo bear oil balance forecast with any kind of line-item breakdown. I've looked for discomfirmation reasons in #OOTT  Bear case is general and newsy.  It may be founded but not (in) concrete.

7867 2018-06-24 20:49:53 I heard rumours of competition for oil smuggling between Italy and France
7868 2018-06-24 20:49:50 Deeply saddened. I hate oil spills so much!!!!
7869 2018-06-24 20:49:50 Do you think what this guy did here was right? Think about someone doing this to your sister and bringing your father into the picture as you foolishly did here.
7870 2018-06-24 20:49:46 Agree CBD oil is like swallowing water from a week old ashtray that’s been left out in the rain. My friend told me to drink orange juice after & it does take the horrid taste away. Not seen any difference or improvements since taking & I got a decent oil
7871 2018-06-24 20:49:33 I can now judge the temperature based on the state of my jar of coconut oil. Liquid = too hot to function. Solid = temperature adequate to function #coconutoil #summerheat #madrid

7878 2018-06-24 20:48:34 Thank you, Senator. I'm more than angry that we always kiss the posterior of "big oil," at the risk of our natural resources, fishing & tourism industries, & especially the future for our next generations. I can scarcely wait til Trump is in the ground, so I can spit on his grave
7879 2018-06-24 20:48:07 We’re trying CBD oil (mixed in churu) to help Yeti’s arthritis. (Our fluffy boy is almost 18!) Thus far it’s only available as oil for cats.
7880 2018-06-24 20:47:50 THC not allowed in CBD oil is my understanding. Like you Rich, I have quite a concoction including tramadol and co-codamol. I've heard of people who've been able to come off ALL their pain meds with medical cannabis where it's legal
7881 2018-06-24 20:47:50 Yeah mine learned to change oil, just finished her brake lesson.  I told her save money and know it's done right.
7882 2018-06-24 20:47:39 However, being stupid is not at all like having a sense of humor. 
7883 2018-06-24 20:47:33 I've got my theories with regard to why the engine oil issue persists.

The initial post was to hopefully draw out other reasons for this.
7884 2018-06-24 20:46:53 Yeah, but everyone is also willing to buy snake oil to avoid another pandemic.
7885 2018-06-24 20:46:51 Get some peppermint oil next time and rub it on your temples and the back of your neck!! I use this when nothing else will work and it’s always given me relief!
7886 2018-06-24 20:46:42 Solar PV + wind + some storage + EVs = freedom from oil & coal.
7887 2018-06-24 20:46:41 How??? Please enunciate the steps, tell me what will you do first second and third...and in what capacity....haven't you sold this snake oil long enough to expect that you will sweet talk this polity yet again  ? Waxing lyrical about venerable names doesnt cut it any more
7888 2018-06-24 20:46:40 Producers of oil and natural gas pay this voluntary tax. Not consumers.
7889 2018-06-24 20:46:39 Started a @Psych_USA rewatch and forgot how "rough" those first 7-8 S1 episodes were. Luckily it settles into the great show it was by back half of the season. "Poker? I Barely Know Her" is a classic. I almost lost it after that Midnight Oil reference.

7896 2018-06-24 20:46:07 We generally don't pay attention to oil grades here (we also don't pay attention to fuel octane rating but that's another thread/story - I must mention however that the responsiveness of a car driven out of Tin Can is different from when it's belly is filled with Nigerian fuel).
7897 2018-06-24 20:46:07 To say nothing of burdening future generations with nuclear waste disposal, lack of oil for them etc. The list of convenient jobs-based arguments is endless. I'm now 63, so unlikely to see the worst of this, but I have a 27-year old son who I would like to be OK for life.

7906 2018-06-24 20:45:36 This is a voluntary tax on the oil and gas industry. Not on consumers. Producers have volunteered to pay this tax to help clean up old historical damage to property done by oil and gas operations - dating back many years ago.

7912 2018-06-24 20:44:58 I was all like 

“ damn I wish I had some dry herb and not just this oil”

 Then seen a homie on the street 

We said what up and he plugged me with a nug of some cookies   

Thank you Lord !
7913 2018-06-24 20:44:55 Also a boars hair brush is key, after you put oil in. It gets it down into the skin, and also helps train it to be a little straighter. Doing all of that makes for a soft and shiny beard, with zero itch.
Once you get out you'll have to try it out!
7914 2018-06-24 20:44:51 Oops guess I’ll get an oil change tomorrow 
7915 2018-06-24 20:44:46 Oh absolutely to all the reasons you said. It’s truly disgusting.
Thanks for the info. I saw “...and she sells weed!” everywhere then came across the screenshots & thought CBD oil isn’t weed at all. I didn’t seek out every product. I prefer to get blowback 1 topic at a time
7916 2018-06-24 20:44:44 Start with all the freebies. No more handouts.
7917 2018-06-24 20:44:21 Because of the oil lol
7918 2018-06-24 20:44:17 So I decided to give into the fad and try using coconut oil as lotion a couple hours ago...and now I can’t get the dog I’m dogsitting to stop chasing me around the house trying to lick me. Currently standing in my bathroom hiding from him

7921 2018-06-24 20:43:48 Maybe if Trump and his voters want to hold immigration to the U.S they should get involved (esp in Mexico against drugcartels) and partner with trade, if only diplomatic relations weren’t so strained right now thanks to Trump. They invade because of socialism and bomb for oil so.

7926 2018-06-24 20:43:20 Anyway one man's 5w-20 is another man's "oil we use for SUV".

I paid less attention to the oil grade of the last car I drove and I paid in spades..

I later observed that the responsiveness of the steering, the sound of the engine & Fuel consumption changed depending on the oil.
7927 2018-06-24 20:43:05 Capture, id, dna sample, bus to airport, military transport to home country. If they don't take them back, don't cut that next aid check. If we are forced to keep them, holding camps.
7928 2018-06-24 20:42:59 Even with oil price being up 50% in past year, Russian GDP only grows at +1.6% because Putin's small group is absolutely looting EVERYTHING of value. 
Any sizeable company is stolen and handed to Putin cronies/proxies.
7929 2018-06-24 20:42:58 Not when morning st of HIS buddies in Big oil stand to profit more with these lessened regulations, penalties & any real accountability
7930 2018-06-24 20:42:52 Can hardly wait to watch the Senegal v Colombia match to closeout Group H. Unfortunately, it will likely lead to one of the two being bumped from the tourney but hoping for some fireworks. #WorldCup
7931 2018-06-24 20:42:48 Perfect, just perfect! A just outcome for an unjust claim against a federal officer. It’s always better to get it right the first time than try to take it back. Perhaps next time she’ll use some decorum in her writing.

7935 2018-06-24 20:42:36 When times are good, AB calls maritimers lazy. When times are bad, AB demands they get more than anyone.
AB oilsands have choked both passengers and grain off our rails and they still demand more concessions from everyone.  The oil industry greed seems bottomless.
7936 2018-06-24 20:42:34 Put clear nail polish over them to stop the itching. And use either coconut oil or coconut/lime verbena lotion to prevent being bit again.
7937 2018-06-24 20:42:23 I’m allergic to chicken so I need to make sure they don’t fry fries in chicken oil. I usually go with something non-fried, like a grilled fish taco.
7938 2018-06-24 20:42:06 I’m on a butcher block kick. Building a desk and bookcases from the stuff. First coat of Danish oil on the desk. Given how much coffee I spill during late night study/writing sessions, only 74 coats to go.

7940 2018-06-24 20:41:56 And I believe you are the type of person who will ruin the country so we are at an impasse.  I thought the poison dwarf was already gearing up for another one. By all means keep your oil revenue.

7946 2018-06-24 20:40:47 How many of them Omega-3 Fish oil pills I gotta take to overdose? Asking for a friend!
7947 2018-06-24 20:40:33 With that being the case why would the English be so worried about independence? 

Scottish oil maybe???
7948 2018-06-24 20:40:26 The impoverished don’t have a voice they are too busy trying to find food.This was largely self inflicted and has been a mixture of corruption,economic illiteracy,complete failure to control inflation &an over reliance on the price of oil. Chilean economy booming in comparison

7953 2018-06-24 20:39:55 @PetAmazed Your fish oil claims 'Pure Norwegian' but the bar code on the bottles says 'origin - Italy' and you are in Vegas: is there Norwegian salmon in the Nevada desert, or is it Italian? Why does your 'service@petamazed.com' email bounce and website is not found? Pls explain
7954 2018-06-24 20:39:51 A couple of years back I walked into a notable (ah.. I finally get to use the word) satellite service station & enquired about servicing costs & oil specs.

"Is the vehicle a saloon car or SUV"

"We have oil that we use for SUV and oil we use for saloon cars"

I did not return.
7955 2018-06-24 20:39:41 Hey @TheAtlantic 
Maybe it would be more constructive to place their false asylum requests at a US Consulate,  rather than a convenience store?

7957 2018-06-24 20:39:18 I happen to believe you are the type of individual that will ruin the Country !! You say You Scots and advocate independence we’ll start campaigning for it!! We’ll spend the oil revenues for Scotland!!

7960 2018-06-24 20:39:09 If you’re having a panic attack just rub some coconut oil on it
7961 2018-06-24 20:39:07 Avocado and garlic oil is the best.
7962 2018-06-24 20:38:54 Yes! I’ve made a sugar scrub with coconut oil, sugar, and peppermint essential oil. Smells delicious and really good for lips and skin! If peppermint is too harsh on your skin use lavender or eucalyptus
7963 2018-06-24 20:38:34 Some of the #Westworld dialogue can be easily attributed to politicians and snake oil salesmen: "Are you quite done yet?! It's time to sell this ruse."
7964 2018-06-24 20:38:21 Agreed. I think the next 12 months is absolutely the hardest oil market to forecast in a very long time given a confluence of so many events. That risk is not yet priced in IMO
7965 2018-06-24 20:38:20 Is it bad that I’m actually considering letting my car blow up before spending 80 dollars to get my oil changed
7966 2018-06-24 20:38:16 Don't know about the US but in the UK they use an oil filteration system where all the oils come into contact (pretty sure it's the same)
7967 2018-06-24 20:38:09 Which is Clary Sage? I used this as an aromatherapy oil many years ago?

7982 2018-06-24 20:36:14 I do this with supplements that really help, like fish oil. Once I’ve been taking it solidly I start thinking I don’t need it. By the time I realize I’m not doing so well, I’ll convince myself I don’t need to take it because it ‘doesn’t work anyway’.
7983 2018-06-24 20:35:58 Take it they are Trump voters waiting for Trump to save them as Trump & grifter pal Pruitt kill all clean water regulations for their oil & gas donor pals, and just anything Obama. They got what you asked for.
7984 2018-06-24 20:35:50 The sad truth ( I keep on saying truth & fact but these are imo) is that Nigeria cannot support the importation or local production of 5w-20 in spite of the fact that many Toyota cars use this oil grade.

This whole narration is moot really as engine oil is engine oil in Nigeria.

7986 2018-06-24 20:35:46 How is it nasty to tell someone to pay attention to OPEC oil production increases that dropped prices, instead of just saying some random comment that isn't based in fact. Oh wait....nevermind #MAGA
7987 2018-06-24 20:35:39 Hmm what would America do without cars, fire trucks, ambulances and semis to transport our goods? America is dependent on oil. Millions still use coal and fuel oil for heat. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
7988 2018-06-24 20:35:35 Thats' not a very good result Rich was that neat CBD Oil taken 3 x a day? Apparently it takes some time to get into your system but not sure how long that takes? #MedicalCannabis #MedicalMarijuana #cbdoil does anyone know how it works for #chronicpain ?

7990 2018-06-24 20:35:22 @costcocanada I went to Costco in Burlington today & an older man serving lamb samples had about 10 fresh samples sitting. I went to take one & he swatted my hand away getting hot oil all over my hand telling me I needed to “wait my turn, there was a man in front of me”. Not okay

7994 2018-06-24 20:34:34 Great to see you there showing that dems care about jobs and wages everywhere in the country. Just saw a news story on MSNBC, Louisiana showing crawdad fishermen concerned about the gas and oil companies destroying the bayous and no one is coming to help protect them. Maybe you?
7995 2018-06-24 20:34:29 Good for you! Yes we have too. We didn’t drink anyway due to Paul having a heart scare a few years back. We cut out caffeine and alcohol before we even went vegan! Our new ebook is completely oil, added salt and sugar free. It’s been really exciting playing around with recipes 
7996 2018-06-24 20:34:20 Yesss!! Get an oil diffuser it will change your life and sleep 
7997 2018-06-24 20:34:19 vape oil. Please I must see
7998 2018-06-24 20:34:17 I took three stool softeners and a laxative. I mixed some garlic with olive oil and then had two cups of black coffee. It's about to get ugly in the bathroom.

8000 2018-06-24 20:34:01 Except for that fact that we continue to import OPEC oil; while their citizens enjoy $0.50/gal gas we are paying damn near $3.00/gal.
8001 2018-06-24 20:34:00 Saturday nighte: a stubborn zit! Dab it with tea tree oil and it'll be gone in no time.
8002 2018-06-24 20:34:00 Not sure more quantitative easing (printing money) is a solution to anything. Or are you suggesting lower taxes and NI for lower paid? Doesn't help if on universal credit. Doesn't help if Brexit results in further food inflation. And if oil price rises all shell will breaks loose
8003 2018-06-24 20:33:59 oil leak in my rear main seal so now we have to drop the tranny

yes i have it memorized
8009 2018-06-24 20:32:33 Well if you don't think that a high performing stock market or efforts to raise domestic oil production, and policies to lower fuel prices should be encouraged, then I'd say you just hate rich people more than you love America. Sad!
8010 2018-06-24 20:32:07 Two way six lane
8011 2018-06-24 20:32:00 People need to stop with this "Find your passion" snake oil. It's not found, its created.
8012 2018-06-24 20:31:59 The fact of the matter is that

1. There is no 5w-20 / 0w-30

2. The closest alternative (clearly described in the user/factory manual as no alternative) are more expensive locally than @amazon sourced spec oil grades.
8013 2018-06-24 20:31:49 Baby lotion & coconut oil is my lifeeeeeee

8037 2018-06-24 20:27:29 Irrespective, cars will still be bought with loans, cars will still be designed, components will still be manufactured, oil companies will still be extracting, cars will still be imported.
8038 2018-06-24 20:27:29 Love how your backward education turns out people like you, oil is a cost now not an income, remember  the idiot figures during the referendum, you lost by the way

8043 2018-06-24 20:26:27 Dude, oil only got big in the 20th century. We were doing pretty good before it came along, and we will do fine after it's gone.  Oil is a convenience, not a necessity.

I'd much rather have electricity than oil.  I can't wait until my electric car!
8044 2018-06-24 20:25:51 Thanks for not burning through 8 barrels of oil using a leaf blowers for that.
8045 2018-06-24 20:25:32 not much actually!!! my nails are usually a little thinner than usual when i take them off but they grow back pretty quickly!! id say get some nail oil or argon oil to take care of them afterwards because they strengthen nails. but in my opinion they’re worth it

8062 2018-06-24 20:23:47 Man I oiled the wrong side of my K&N air filter and had to wash it , let it air dry,oil it, wait for it to soak in again

8066 2018-06-24 20:23:13 Sorry this is late.

The 2006-2010 Toyota Rav4 as well as several Camrys which share the same engines are specced as requiring 5w-20 or 0w-30 synthetic oil.

There is currently no manufacturer offering 5w-20 or 0w-30 in Nigeria.

(Castrol/Eterna attempted to supply  but ceased).

8068 2018-06-24 20:22:56 You will find that Tony Blair & Donald Dewar on the day before devolution moved the Scottish maritime border.
It used to go straight out from Berwick-on-tweed.
It now meanders north - up as far north as Carnoustie, taking in a few oil wells.
Check current maps & older maps.

8074 2018-06-24 20:22:36 He does make jobs for people in Other places. It’s not his job to make jobs just for Texas. And so u telling me it’s not a rule anymore, that we can dump oil in the ocean without having to clean it up I have to see that because that’s stupid and if it’s true I’m not for it.
8075 2018-06-24 20:22:32 Up. .smoothie. watch England and highly delighted. Lunch of King prawns in olive oil and lemon. Ribs, wings, rice and salad. Son goes out the front when the ice cream man comes round and brings me an oyster to cheer me up.A sit in the garden. My Sunday is complete. ..
8076 2018-06-24 20:22:32 Everything you make in US, keep. All of it. Don’t ask for our water. Or electricity. Or investment. Or oil.

8081 2018-06-24 20:21:53 I do some full fat dairy, coconut oil, mct, veggies, cream cheese, pork rinds, meat, not a lot of lunch though
8082 2018-06-24 20:21:40 Best to use vegetable oil, but you can use olive oil or even butter.
8083 2018-06-24 20:21:40 Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) shut down! Run out of crude to process. No money to pay salaries.

8085 2018-06-24 20:21:25 homie............. i felt the burn of pepperminy oil just from reading this tweet. rip. 
8086 2018-06-24 20:21:23 Very nice!!
8087 2018-06-24 20:21:21 YOU KNOW IT HOT WHEN THE COCONUT OIL LIQUID DAWGGGGG
8088 2018-06-24 20:21:19 The oil industry has known for decades that climate change is real, caused by fossil fuels and potentially catastrophic. But that’s not the story it told the public. We take a look at exactly what #BigOilKnew. #YEARSproject with The Center for Public Integrity
8089 2018-06-24 20:21:11 Which people? The small crumbs increase has been going to high gas prices, this winter heating oil big increase, our heath ins. costs big increase thanks to GOP! Exactly which people have all this growing confidence? The rich? We have not saved any additional “hard-earnedmoney”!
8090 2018-06-24 20:20:36 @VolkswagenSA why is it that we are all charged for 5l of oil and they only put 3.7l in our VW's. Another word for this is Stealing! 
8091 2018-06-24 20:20:33 Nope ,I'm still perambulating, if we can delete d insults from her database I'll fall in.
8092 2018-06-24 20:20:19 I love you so much caseybot you are the finest machine on this website I will buy you all the oil your circuitry requires
8093 2018-06-24 20:20:19 Mix grated, unscented soap; washing soda (not baking soda); borax; and a little bit of scented oil to make your own laundry detergent that works better than the shit you use now and is a fraction of the cost
8094 2018-06-24 20:20:06 I do that too, but then the paper towel asborbs heaps of oil & then I’m throwing away an oily paper towel  I’ll use a pastry brush for things like the waffle iron, but it’s never an even coating.
8095 2018-06-24 20:19:47 Because swimming in oil sounds so enticing.

8099 2018-06-24 20:19:24 He's trying to say bribery with oil money can get Saudi Arabia an 8th place.
8100 2018-06-24 20:19:22 Its all in who ya know. These little crooks walk around as if they are aristocrats when really theyre just snake oil sales men selling  stupid and the stupid buy into it. These ppl would be king louis’ed by now if we werent so pacified and blind.
8101 2018-06-24 20:19:21 Well I guess you’ve fall out already right?

How much more money do you think each of you would have in your pockets without having to pay the huge military costs, counter terrorism intelligence border patrols, etc.
It would be a VERY lucrative place to be a civilian
8107 2018-06-24 20:18:20 thank U & I will read-just read in the UK daily mail that the standing rock protest was orchestrated by Russia in order to keep US Oil supplies low & sell theirs more easily
8108 2018-06-24 20:18:17 I am mixed and have a mixed hair type. My hair isn't kinky however, it's very in between a black hair texture and a wavy caucasian hair type. It takes a good week or so to actually build up oil. Regardless of hair type you shouldn't wash daily. But what I said is still facts.
8109 2018-06-24 20:18:14 Would think you religious type would've figured out by now Earth is Eden and we been programmed by luciferian (oil, currency cabals) to mutilate life existing around you our entire lives. Church is tax exempt on purpose!
8110 2018-06-24 20:18:03 When you remove the oil, we live longer. For a number of reasons but mostly it has to do with that if you don't eat the oil and the animal stuff there's nothing to clog the arteries.
8111 2018-06-24 20:17:54 Let us know when she starts tweeting and showing her work and I'll be sure to follow then.  Her paintings are wonderful!

P.S.  I forgot, is it OK to use olive oil when making roux?
8112 2018-06-24 20:17:39 Surprised, I kinda thought oil on canvass back then!
8113 2018-06-24 20:17:36 Tomorrow we will be outside for practice from 1215-230. Please apply sunscreen prior to arriving to ensure you will not have excess oil on your hands. We WILL be stunting- so please remove all piercings and do not wear hard hair pieces / clips. Get excited  see you tomorrow!
8114 2018-06-24 20:17:29 Fucking oil pressure.  This year is absolute bullshit.
8115 2018-06-24 20:17:26 I promise that the tanning oil I bought this summer is mislabeled...

I believe it's actually SPF 100 and makes me WHITER 
8116 2018-06-24 20:17:24 @matteosalvinimi 
Libya can not accept any asylum camps for the migrants.
Libya is not responsible about the poor in Africa.
Europe was responsible about that.
Every day European companies stolen  Gold , Oil ,Uranium..etc IN CHEAP PRICES and leaved the African in poor.

8121 2018-06-24 20:16:42 Dinger missed a shift and she blew. McMurray missed shift and lost oil pressure. 78 4 14 11 halfway through stage 2
8122 2018-06-24 20:16:24 Everyday. I use The Chubby Afro's hair oil (it's on etsy). I used to have really bad dandruff and a smelly scalp no matter how much I washed my hair. And it's soooo bomb
8123 2018-06-24 20:16:20 No Zamfara. Me I don’t even use etisalat
8124 2018-06-24 20:16:10 @VWSAnews This is all great stuff and I enjoy my VW's but why charge me for 5l of oil every service and only put 3.7l? 
8125 2018-06-24 20:16:09 Bloody sad if business confidence drops because of government policy on oil exploration .At the beginning of the 20th century the world was well on the way to electric cars and trains.
 oil interests dominated from then on. But our Simon still thinks we should keep drilling
8126 2018-06-24 20:16:07 I think he meant if you fry anything haram in the oil that you use for frying chips
8127 2018-06-24 20:15:51 Yoga, meditation, B vitamins, oil painting, swearing at children in the street.
8128 2018-06-24 20:15:40 Check on your younger one's and friends that went to d beach today to celebrate eid,report reaching us states an emergency occurred but details will surface soon...
8129 2018-06-24 20:14:57 Trying an overnight avo & olive oil hair treatment. Apparently really great in keeping hair moisturized. Let’s see 
8130 2018-06-24 20:14:53 Like burning the fuck out of your hands and arms on fryer oil all day, while also working the grill, for $11/hr
8131 2018-06-24 20:14:44 I hope a lot of that oil spills up on his FL property.
8132 2018-06-24 20:14:38 If that's what you think, then why are you trying to stop us from cleaning up Mother Nature's oil spills?
8133 2018-06-24 20:14:21 But what about all the jobs he claims to make lmao . That’s my point. It is our job to clean our oceans when it’s our oil spills causing it . Killing people wildlife etc  . And people killing people because of their skin color doesn’t equate to “just being mean now “ but go off
8134 2018-06-24 20:14:16 But I thin d accent was kind of mixed with that of KT,lol don't worry ,I'll send it to u when etisalat does same to u
8135 2018-06-24 20:14:09 The olive oil isn’t doing her any favors she’s just lucky
8136 2018-06-24 20:14:02 Lost oil pressure
8137 2018-06-24 20:13:46 Got up late. Had a coffee and a muggy yoghurt. Mrs done me a blinding smoothie. Then after that king prawns in olive oil and lemon with a few chilli flakes. Main course ribs, wings, rice and salad. About 7 pm ice cream man comes round. My son runs out and treats me to an oyster
8138 2018-06-24 20:13:32 I think the reason is  because medicinal patients in chronic pain should  have the right to take their medication. However, they may have to switch the form of consumption.. transition to vaporization... Or oil .
8139 2018-06-24 20:13:32 Oh ok cuz the first thing I think about when the discussion is on  Afghanistan is how we stole oil from the Native Americans. It's a good thing you made it clear and used "Native American" through out your tweet. Oh wait...you didn't. And you call me stupid?

8142 2018-06-24 20:13:07 It was an easy guess.  Sultan #Erdogan is loved by his people.  Since you adopt to Zionist lies and proapganda in Western media, you don't realize that because you are blinded by their non-sense anti-Islamic agendas.
8143 2018-06-24 20:13:04 Your character is showing again Snake Oil Salesman.  (BTW I can’t stand Pelosi)

8145 2018-06-24 20:12:57 Just CBD. It comes in oil & in little dog treats. I bought the oil & the only dog of mine that tried it didn't care for the taste.
8146 2018-06-24 20:12:51 Is this about not giving us happy bees
8147 2018-06-24 20:12:50 Don’t have a problem with that.  When someone crosses the border illegally, or overstays their visa, why clog the court system with those cases?  It’s pretty cut and dried.
8148 2018-06-24 20:12:48 coconut oil is actually the best

8181 2018-06-24 20:08:12 Does anyone have any exposure to, information on how he ran things in OK? Just curious. I have a hunch this is business as usual for Pruitt and an artifact of OK’s oil/gas culture.

8183 2018-06-24 20:08:00 Apparently Trump has "asked" Japan to stop buying Iranian oil. Expanding his trade war to third parties. Grossly overestimating American influence in the world. #Trump #BoycottUSA

8185 2018-06-24 20:07:49 If you write the article without discussing keto or LCHF, then you’ve missed the point of exogenous MCT oil. You’re taking down a straw man.
8186 2018-06-24 20:07:46 You were led into temptation by the promise of new car safety and technology, and now look at what's happened!  (That's ok -- I'm at the 12 month mark with a '17 GTI, and wondering how the plastic oil pan and intake will hold up in 2027.)
8187 2018-06-24 20:07:26 What is needed is infrastructure to get the oil to market and refineries that can process light crude.  That would reduce the need to import heavy crude.  Investors are working on the pipeline infrastructure problem it is not clear that refinery issue is being addressed.
8188 2018-06-24 20:07:16 Remember the dictator in Venezuela giving poor people in Massachusetts free hearing oil and one of the Kennedy kids saying he was a better man than Bush? Move to Venezuela cupkake.
8189 2018-06-24 20:07:01 .@McMurray says he has no oil pressure

#NASCAR | #TSM350
8190 2018-06-24 20:06:43 Yeah and who gives a shit about silly things like the ocean and environment? Let's get rid of protections for oil spills in the ocean right before they force drilling off coastal states that don't want it.
8191 2018-06-24 20:06:27 If you had left the Iranian alone then there would be more oil on the market. You did this and will not take responsibility for it. There is more misery coming. The high price is you fault and these high prices at the pump is your doing. I forgot you don't read reports. "READ".
8192 2018-06-24 20:06:23 Freudian truth here. Men indeed do a lot of dangerous work. They dig tunnels under sea, they build skyscrapers, they usually 'man' lifeboats, males usually dismantle bombs, fisherfolk (a dangerous occupation) are usually men: miners: oil rig workers: etc.
8193 2018-06-24 20:06:22 > A bath and lavender oil sure does wonders. Lazily sling an arm around him while you’re at it, because he’s warm, which makes it ten times better.

8198 2018-06-24 20:05:52 Impressive Mike, you managed to get most everything in that tweet wrong. Using less oil won’t reduce our needs in time and the pipeline is not only for export
8199 2018-06-24 20:05:49 You can't fight ignorance with facts. Like oil and water.
8200 2018-06-24 20:05:38 Thanks, Big John! I'm 35 but regularly use Oil of Olay to maintain a youthful glow. I have not lost my job as a direct result of EU membership, but I do know some of the 65,000 retail workers that have lost their jobs as a direct result of Brexit.
8201 2018-06-24 20:05:33 Isnt soybean oil bad for you
8202 2018-06-24 20:05:29 But, quit trying to change the topic.  The topic was separation of children from their parents, which occurred under Obama’s watch.  Unless you can show some screen shots of your tweets denouncing Obama for that, then you are a pure hypocrite.
8203 2018-06-24 20:05:26 Today my uncle asked me if putting oil on your nose is the new makeup trend and I'm like no why and he's like you didn't purposely put oil on your nose today? 


8204 2018-06-24 20:05:20 Omg! I need to get an oil change ASAP. Almost forgot smh
8205 2018-06-24 20:05:17 The only reason Obama signed that EO was to keep Americans dependant upon his Muslim buddies in the middle east by forcing us to pay outrageous prices for their oil rather than drilling our own. Not to mention all the rough necks Obama put out of a job.
8206 2018-06-24 20:05:15 World food prices keep rising, up 2.2 pts or 1.2% in May, mostly on account of spike in price of dairy and cereals. 
The meat price index had a small drop, but not much change there. Vegetable oil price at 27 month low. Sugar index still falling, now for 6 months straight. #FAO

8215 2018-06-24 20:04:28 Look our Ricky don’t get in the Oil
8216 2018-06-24 20:04:13 Oil prices have spiked since Trump/Bolton decided that Iran is some kind of devil nation again. Fracking depends on higher oil prices for any chance of profitability. The US has endorsed and embraced fracking. Do the math
8217 2018-06-24 20:04:13 They named that contrived flag snatching stunt as a "tangible". Lol.  The Cal system divested literally 7 times the amount of $ from oil and sands holdings companies than they did prisons. And those funds were divested amid "student pressure" not BLM according to LA times

8219 2018-06-24 20:03:50 How much oil revenue do you think goes into equalization payments?
8220 2018-06-24 20:03:43 Good good! Olive oil smokes at a low temp, vegetable and grape seed oil smoke at high temps.
8221 2018-06-24 20:03:41 Of course I do.  I am not a blind sycophant follower.

I can’t even begin to count the number of times I have cringed because of some of his silly tweets.
8222 2018-06-24 20:03:27 The only reason Norway can sustain a socialist economy is because of North Sea oil. Were it not for that, you would have system collapse.
8223 2018-06-24 20:03:22 Thought you said you will single handedly fix all of our problems? Or was that complete bullshit? I don’t know, doesn’t seem like a snake oil salesman to lie like that...

The sea population enlarged.
8225 2018-06-24 20:02:59 Sry I should’ve been more specific. CBD oil aka hemp oil (what was in that screenshot) is extracted from pot yes. But its chemical makeup changes in the process so much it’s no longer considered an illicit narcotic but a holistic hemp by product. 1/2
8226 2018-06-24 20:02:58 Every since they said she squirt motor oil bro I see it. I think she stank too
8227 2018-06-24 20:02:44 So you are also ok with drilling in Alaska parks, banned toxin asbestos being approved again, higher taxes for low/mid income ppl, higher healthcare costs with no pre-existing conditions coverage, fewer benefits for veterans, oil drilling off US coast except FL. Ok then.
8228 2018-06-24 20:02:32 900 mg is just the right amount of CBD hemp oil to keep me giving a fuck about what's going on around me, but also allow me to not obsess about it. #selfcare #Resist

8232 2018-06-24 20:02:17 Also, we use the by-products for a huge range of uses. Without that we'd be using more oil and plastic, at higher cost. All manageable of course, just worth knowing.
8233 2018-06-24 20:02:16 Dan must've went to the Hemp store and bought high grade CBD oil. Mariota 3rd when Luck hasn't thrown a ball in 18 months ??? OK. 
8234 2018-06-24 20:02:13 @eco_boy have you ever thought of doing a vegetarian cook book. That's not too pretentious or assumes all vegetarians eat cheese or uses olive oil, or likes curry. As an omnivore (girlfriend is vegetarian) am really surprised theres so few books out there.

8239 2018-06-24 20:01:11 We need the oil my boy. Think long and hard on where our economy would be if we did not have the oil industry to backup such things as equalization? Think. Don’t speak just think long and hard.
8240 2018-06-24 20:01:09 I tried to save this sauce left over from this once. I put it in a container in the fridge. All the oil and fat separated out and I didn’t feel like heating it up and using it 
8241 2018-06-24 20:01:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and then was released into a U.

8247 2018-06-24 20:00:39 That’s not at all how it works. OPEC bases its pricing for oil on the global climate of supply and demand. They literally teach you that in 2nd grade.

Just so Genie Energy, can continue stealing the oil from

8258 2018-06-24 19:58:54 Drove over a big rock and gashed a hole in my oil pan so when we went to drive out of Pitch a Tent this morning the engine quit ..  we were so far out in the brush most tow truck companies didn’t even wanna come get us.
8259 2018-06-24 19:58:30 You need my teenage son for 24 hours.. wee all over the toilet, plates left in his room, not to mention the bottle of baby oil I ‘discovered’ by the side of his bed 
8260 2018-06-24 19:58:25 I ate the last to candies I have and just made myself more hungry. the last food I have here is canned flakes and oil... don't make me ><
8261 2018-06-24 19:58:20 Cook it on medium heat. Never heat olive oil above medium. Garlic and onions need to be cooked at a medium heat slowly so they sweat.
8262 2018-06-24 19:58:10 Getting an oil change and a woman in the lobby said "I'm serious as a heart attack" and I think this Jiffy Lube has a portal to 1996.
8263 2018-06-24 19:58:00 And guess what...the whole asylum thing is just the latest buzzword these illegal aliens are being taught to say. When one crosses the border illegally, they have no claim to asylum.  They have to present themselves at an official port of entry for asylum claims.
8264 2018-06-24 19:57:49 I opposed several Obama policies: e.g., high levels of deportations, use of drones in Yemen & other countries, cracking down on whistleblowers. I have found that many Trump supporters have a cult-like devotion to him. Do you oppose any Trump policies, statements or tweets?

8275 2018-06-24 19:55:59 ‘Fans’ don’t surprise me anymore.
Just hope some of the effort they put into whining about the Oil is actually used in addressing their wive’s problems with them.

8279 2018-06-24 19:55:10 It has long been said about politics in the Middle East, the two most valuable commodities in the region are oil and water.  The vast amount of water that the Red Sea/Dead Sea Canal brings to Ammon could make it very rich indeed. #Jordan #economy

8291 2018-06-24 19:53:47 I think he plans on paying back the money to CPP by selling oil to Asia by doubling the line and increasing oil tanker traffic out of Metro Vancouver. $15B of extra oil tanker traffic each year! No doubt, at the rate he spends, it will be $150B by the time it’s built!

8311 2018-06-24 19:50:25 Oil Painting
8312 2018-06-24 19:50:07 Wrong. People who have applied for asylum --- which they have every right to do -- have also been separated from their children. Today Trump tweeted that he wants people deported without judges or legal cases. Unconstitutional idea from the Authoritarian-in-Chief.

8326 2018-06-24 19:48:13 The last part of this verse suggests that Ammon has now become rich: “That trusted in her treasures…”  While this may be true in the future it certainly is not true now.  Modern day Jordan has no income from oil like many nations in the Middle East and ...

8328 2018-06-24 19:48:01 3) slack.  Cuts to CHIP funding are occurring because the funding for the program was authorized, but unused. It doesn’t make sense to continue providing funds if they are not going to be used.  If they aren’t being used, it doesn’t matter if they are cut now, does it?
8329 2018-06-24 19:47:52 Use cleansing oil
8330 2018-06-24 19:47:29 Getting oil leak alarm notifications on my phone.  No thanks, I'm off today, and we have a 24/7 service that handles those.
8331 2018-06-24 19:47:17 Shocking LYING LITTLE WEASEL SCOTT PRUITT ISN'T BEING HONEST OR TRUTHFUL!! SAY IT ISN'T SO!! What I thought was interesting was the piece about the crawfishermen looking to help from Trump and Pruitt. Sadly, not going to get it. Big oil/gas are their friends.
8332 2018-06-24 19:47:05 how is taking oil that is not yours without paying for it not stealing
8333 2018-06-24 19:47:01 OPEC and Russia agreeing to cut oil production, US exporting our own oil, the Iran deal and the boom in electric cars. Did you have a point you were making or did you just feel lonely and felt the need to comment?
8334 2018-06-24 19:46:58 Chef McElroy cut up some potatoes, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was an old shoe brush, along with Silly Putty.
8335 2018-06-24 19:46:50 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...

8341 2018-06-24 19:46:18 Did the pan have hot oil in it? 
8342 2018-06-24 19:46:10 Can't wait until we don't have to depend on any oil.
8343 2018-06-24 19:46:06 your welcome love! plus there’s a tea tree oil peeling/face mask from the body shop that also help a lot!
8344 2018-06-24 19:45:58 never denied that any oil was taken whatsoever, don’t retract your argument, your entire premise was the was was fought to steal oil, that is inherently false and propaganda against the military and the republican party
8345 2018-06-24 19:45:36 Does it come wit Red oil nd pepper?
8346 2018-06-24 19:45:34 I put a crap tonne of coconut oil in my hair to really give my hair and scalp a good hydrating and still I look like I touched a plasma ball 
8347 2018-06-24 19:45:34 also remember that even if you believe that earth is running out of oil ( it may or may not be, i am not sure ) ICE engine can be adapted to run on renewable biofuels

we could even genetically engineer crops specifically to produce biofuels for ICE engine !
8348 2018-06-24 19:45:33 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

Trust, verify, &open your arms in welcome
8356 2018-06-24 19:44:39 I highly doubt it. And I like it that way. I'm glad I'm no oil painting and get creeps messaging me constantly. 
8357 2018-06-24 19:44:39 Nothing. I don't put oil on my weaves. When I wash, I don't use shampoo. I use shampoo only to wash the wefts. Put Tresemmé conditioner on the hair itself, microwave it for like 2-3 mins then rinse and dry.

U poor thing are the reason y we don't feel good walking out of our house sometimes, let alone showing ourselves naked to others. But sure, oil is expensive.
8362 2018-06-24 19:44:11 Looking forward to seeing our parents on Friday to watch the children and look at their palm oil exhibition #learning #chesterzoo #palmoil #makingadifference

8364 2018-06-24 19:44:01 bro ur fuckin retarded, im from iraq and hav been to the country post war and hav heard multiple citizens who were in the oil industry speak of how americans would take oil during the war.
8365 2018-06-24 19:43:56 @HamiltonMusical My daughter is a fan of the music and excited about what she has heard of the show.

She is a student. But even the bad seats are £80 a pop.

There's nothing wrong with turning over the engine with old oil..

But please give the young women and men a chance.

8369 2018-06-24 19:43:47 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS you promised to help Louisiana fishermen when you ran for president. It’s been a year and a half and they are still waiting. But your butt buddy in the EPA is lining his pockets and helping Big oil. How do you feel about screwing Louisiana fishermen?
8370 2018-06-24 19:43:23 Let me target oil. Almost everything has been stolen now.
8371 2018-06-24 19:43:03 He has the advantage of social media to advance his cause (if you want to call it that) He has 90% approval rating among educated GOP because he is a carnival barker, snake oil salesman who is distracting the masses from the crimes they are committing inside our government.

8377 2018-06-24 19:42:12 this is an absurd opinion article.  @GovMikeHuckabee has been one of the most divisive and reckless cheerleaders for our current psychotic destructive president in the nation.  He is a snake oil salesman and that is what is legacy will be.  a false prophet.

8380 2018-06-24 19:41:36 Saudi Arabia has one of the worse human right abuse record after North Korea but @realDonaldTrump turns a blind eye because of the oil money or his business interests in Saudi. Hypocrisy at its peak.

Here’s a news flash: if parents don’t break the law, they won’t be separated from their children.  It’s a simple concept.  As far as CHIP funding, Medicaid and Medicare are available to pick up the

8387 2018-06-24 19:41:01 Funny you say that. My grandpa did this to not let his son die in forced Iranian military service, thanks to being under the shah’s oil company. And my dad works as an emt. It’s sad when people want empathy and emotion to pardon a legally defined crime.
8388 2018-06-24 19:40:59 Is Vivo Energy aware that the Shell Petrol Station along Outering Rd Tena is conning Motorist by pretending to do Oil Change 
8389 2018-06-24 19:40:59 It's an Associated Press story, but it does say the train was carrying oil from Alberta to Stroud, Oklahoma, for ConocoPhillips.

8395 2018-06-24 19:39:38 My wife worked in a chemical plant. Once she got pregnant, they were like, no you can't work here. The building was a bomb shelter. Oil execs work downtown far from the plants. Engineers design the plants downtown. Technicians work in the plants. Same software different purposes.
8396 2018-06-24 19:39:31 My dog was prescribed Rimadryl for his old age aches and pains. It also affects the liver. No thanks. I put him on CBD oil treats (not this person's) and it appears to work just fine without the side effects. However, he just turned 15 and it's no longer working by itself.
8397 2018-06-24 19:39:17 I don’t take pleasure in illegal immigrants getting caught.  If I was in their shoes I would probably do as they do. Look for work to support my family. But, we can no longer afford it as a nation.  It is best to stop illegal immigration at the border.

8401 2018-06-24 19:38:37 1) When parents commit crimes, they get separated from their children.  It happens to US citizens every day.  I don’t think illegal alien criminals should be any different. Is it heart breaking?  Yes.  It is very sad and unfortunate. It is unfair to the children? Yes.

8404 2018-06-24 19:38:13 Make sure you’re using products that are oil free and wash your face twice a day tone with witch hazel and moisturize no matter how oily your skin is OH AND THE MARIO BASDESCU DRYING LOTION IS AMAZING and I know that it’s cliché but drinking lots and lots of water rlly helps
8405 2018-06-24 19:38:08 Ferrero owns it here or I wouldn’t have bought it.  I boycott Nestle because of their use of Milk Nurses who led to the deaths of babies in other countries.  They will never get my money.  And yes to the palm oil not being good.  #CareLikeADemon #BringBackJohnTague

8407 2018-06-24 19:37:59 I need a new car ASAP because this 300 for an oil change finna hurt my heart
8408 2018-06-24 19:37:46 It also means that they were not hedging during this massive oil rally from $40 to $80, contrary to international best practice, meaning that their pricing would have resulted in loss making routes when competing with others who had hedged earlier.
8409 2018-06-24 19:37:38 PSA: coconut oil and cocoa oil are NOT the same. Thank you.
8410 2018-06-24 19:37:32 My bro and I put mct oil in our coffees and now we’re just lit on a Sunday morning with nothing to do FOOKKKK
8411 2018-06-24 19:37:12 Time to let go of the gas loving business.  It has no future except a destructive one and now there are cheaper alternatives if we can keep the oil industry from trying to snuff it out.

8419 2018-06-24 19:35:43 Imagine if this oil was safely tucked away, quietly flowing thru some pipeline....    oh,  wait.     THIS is the better, safer solution....
8420 2018-06-24 19:35:41 Look all I’m saying is if you drive aggressively in a Prius, you the same person who wants to speak to the manager when they don’t use canola oil on your avocado toast 
8421 2018-06-24 19:35:36 Russia was highly motivated to do whatever it could to prevent Hillary Clinton's election. The Russian economy, which is smaller than Italy's, was getting hit very hard by low oil prices and the deal with Iran. Putin probably would have helped any candidate opposing her.
8422 2018-06-24 19:35:09 so ur denying the fact that america stole crude oil from iraq? is that really what ur trying to tell me
8423 2018-06-24 19:34:31 Yes.  Even the GOP neverTrumpers were frothing at the mouth to work for a Jeb campaign & springboard to new heights even if he lost (which he would have).  It's always about the Insiders.  All they're selling is snake oil for the masses.

8427 2018-06-24 19:33:49 You needed to add a little oil. (That's what my mum does at least xD)

8429 2018-06-24 19:33:26 If we were truly energy independent as a country then we wouldn't be importing oil.

8433 2018-06-24 19:32:51 I use bio oil. But I’m kind of heavy handed honesty
8434 2018-06-24 19:32:48 I’m having a #selfcare Sunday. Full manicure happening now then a coconut oil mask for my hair tonight.

8436 2018-06-24 19:32:20 His family and businesses are raking it in, esp due to relationships w/ non-democratic foreign governments. Meanwhile wages aren’t keeping up with food, oil, other goods. Economy good for the wealthy maybe as corporations aren’t sharing much with the workers.
8437 2018-06-24 19:32:13 We could see spike up in WTI due to infrastructure constraints in moving oil around. Backwardation premiums can go to new records and speeds between Brent and WTI will go down. Many moving parts. Watch Cushing inventories closely for cues.
8438 2018-06-24 19:32:13 Unit of account has nothing to do with generally acceptable credit instruments (or commodities) exchanged & priced by reference to it. Ratio involves neither price nor unit of account & to be a meaningful ratio either gold or oil must be universally useful: oil is but gold is not
8439 2018-06-24 19:32:11 And yet Texans foot the bill for all the wear and tear on our highways caused by the oil industry's heavy trucks because the @TexasGOP won't have them pay their fair share

8442 2018-06-24 19:31:56 The question at large is “how do you change a racist mind”? The answer is, “you don’t”. We take back our country, and like when children were sick you shove the Castor Oil down their throat. Education and evolution will take care of future, can’t waste time trying to change them.
8443 2018-06-24 19:31:13 Someone told one of my pregnant locals to drink caster oil in order to have her baby come out already... that doesn’t even sound right

8448 2018-06-24 19:30:30 It's CBD oil, which has no psychoactive effects and is great for anxiety, inflammation, etc. In very small quantities it's safe for pets. This woman is an asshat, though, and her business should be run into the ground regardless.

8464 2018-06-24 19:28:38 If the US does not interfere and allow India to deepen the Iranian port,Israel completes a deal with Iran on it's eastern oil fields, Belt an Road projects for India to Afghanistan, and China's train service to Europe come to completion it might usher in a new era.

8470 2018-06-24 19:27:24 Trump promised supporters he would drain the swamp its just not the swamp they wanted. The Chapel Aiea Basin in Louisiana (the swamp) is suffering bc Trump Admin issued permits to oil & gas Industries to #DrainTheSwamp EPA Scott Pruitt deregulated safety nets that protect swamps
8471 2018-06-24 19:27:23 MSM coverage is skipping over the cause for  people trying to escape the chaos in their own countries, and that would be US drug wars, money wars, oil wars, etc. This is the fault of the US neocons, and we owe reparations.
8472 2018-06-24 19:27:21 frightening how a ‘nice’ ‘reasonable’ chap with ‘sensible’ ‘rational’ presentations convinces so many. He has reasonable understanding of technicalities but constantly presents invalid arguments & false premises. ignores counter arguments & conflates issues. Snake oil salesman
8473 2018-06-24 19:27:20 just wanna thank baby oil for existing
8474 2018-06-24 19:27:18 I use baby oil for romans hair most of the time  his hair is thin right now so I’m not trying to over do it

8479 2018-06-24 19:26:51 Oh ok 

I love that Caivil oil 
8480 2018-06-24 19:26:44 No, it looks like they really are inviting you to work with either some hot oil or high voltage. I say go for it!
8481 2018-06-24 19:26:44 Well it’s still important to think about. The US produces more oil than SA, and much more natural gas. Gas already isn’t cheap (oil will probably stay between $60-$65, because of fracking), so whatever deal you’re talking about must not be significant anymore.
8482 2018-06-24 19:26:13 "Oil of Old-Age" moisturiser is the best 
8483 2018-06-24 19:26:00 @CarolineLucas is against coal, oil, gas  and "reckless" nuclear, which means we have to find about an extra 90% of our energy to fund this freedom of movement. Apparently this gap will be filled by wind and solar, but the wind isn't blowing right now and the sun is just setting.
8484 2018-06-24 19:25:55 My ultimate fear is that they bleach their hair back to back & there is no deep conditioner, hot oil treatment, nada is sight. Rip in peace their scalps & hair lines 
8485 2018-06-24 19:25:23 True. I don’t think red hens should be compelled to serve Colonel Sanders, tho.
8486 2018-06-24 19:25:12 That was the part that was so shocking to me, and truly made me sick. 
It's still going on. 
and yes, of course there are some good ones, who just want to help the poor, but it's the ones hired by the gas and oil companies, that are the most evil.
8487 2018-06-24 19:25:10 Do not take the mind of these people in jealousy, they feel envious of the people and in the development of the people. You can not see the real thing, where really these people come from, it is better if you give oil to your own charcoal
8488 2018-06-24 19:25:05 "Now, Therefore, Be it Resolved that the Board of Supervisors of Contra Costa County opposes new offshore drilling
development and objects to any new oil and gas leases off the California coast..."

8490 2018-06-24 19:24:53 Boiled with sesame oil! mmmm
8491 2018-06-24 19:24:42 how are people gonna recommend using coconut oil for hair masks without mentioning that after doing it it'll feel like your hair, hands, and apartment are slathered in lube forever
8492 2018-06-24 19:24:34 Yes people could have done this   if your petrol pump vendors have not stolen the petrol they sell to innocent customer. Nearly every petrol pump under Indian oil , Bharat petroleum etc steal petrols , there is a kind of massive rackets undergoing.
8493 2018-06-24 19:24:26 Yet another example of how the mass hysteria is 1) made up, and; 2) demonstrates how the DEMSM anointed BO with oil.
8494 2018-06-24 19:23:50 My oil light just came on. And it’s crazy because it feels like I JUST had an oil change! I’m pissed now

8502 2018-06-24 19:22:51 If a corporation puts out a product that kills people they get to say, "sorry, my bad" and move on. People have no longer have recourse. Banks can now screw you over and you have no recourse.  National wonders are now just more oil fields to fill corporate coffers.

8517 2018-06-24 19:20:30 I only came for 1 damn thing which is a oil change and they ass wanna tell me 3 other things I need to get. Ugh.
8518 2018-06-24 19:20:25 Allowing oil drilling to pollute the oceans. The 2 pipelines he ok dokied already have had more than 1 spill, polluting water and farmlands. He ok'd a sulfur smelting plant that will pollute a water supply. He made it so that if you get hurt at work you have no recompense.
8519 2018-06-24 19:19:52 Wasn't there an oil crisis around that time? Not everything is down to the EU.
8520 2018-06-24 19:19:43 Made my own glowy body oil for under £5 and I swear I'm gonna live my best life with it, this summer
8521 2018-06-24 19:19:40 Years ago the EIA removed On-Lease storage from their commercial crude oil storage data shifting the storage curve down ~30MM Bbls. I am very interested to know what our storage data would like like with that volume counted. I am confident it is >30MM Bbl's.

8523 2018-06-24 19:19:04 You get a sweet oil soaked burger too. I don’t see what the big deal is, I e had better burgers 
8524 2018-06-24 19:19:04 You’re ignoring the geopolitical element.  If you can price oil, etc directly into another commodity at a ratio of your choosing, you effectively dictate the int’l trade value of the USD by doing so.  It turns out Washington doesn’t like that historically.
8525 2018-06-24 19:18:51 Just made #DIY carpet freshener. I added several drops of our Dispel (odor eliminator) oil blend to a shaker of baking soda, let it rest on surfaces for 15 mins, vacuumed. Smells amazing & feels good to save a few bucks using a more natural product. :)

8551 2018-06-24 19:15:06 Many 'olive oils' are not real or not fully olive oil. It's a large counterfeit market. They may be contain unlabeled vegetable or peanut oils. Be wary!

8553 2018-06-24 19:14:36 I'm against ANY administration separating children from their parents. Now answer my question: are you OK with Trump (the president who is in office NOW) cutting CHIP and separating children from their parents? Yes or No.

8602 2018-06-24 19:08:01 …‘world class oil spill response’ is a laughable oxymoron, resulting in severe real world damage…
8603 2018-06-24 19:08:00 Two filthy pigs worrying about someone trying to make a dollar, probably doing a favor for the people in the area. The people complain about the little girl in a supposed free country are usually the ones that want all regulations lifted on banks, polluting oil and coal co.

8616 2018-06-24 19:06:35 Agreed.  There's decent evidence that very few supplements (both herbal and vitamin) produce positive effects in normal people, yet it's a huge industry.  As far as I can tell, only vitamin D and fish oil are really clearly beneficial, and even for fish oil there's debate.
8617 2018-06-24 19:06:34 Care to put that I to context? What's the temperary situation? Oil price? Also, please explain why it is equitable for Quebec and Manitoba to charge artificially low hydro rates to lower their resource revenue and increase their equalization entitlements?

8623 2018-06-24 19:06:17 The regulations protecting the world’s oceans weren’t frivolous nor did they impede Big Oil’s ability to be profitable. 

Recently reported by ABC News: Big Oil's most profitable quarter ever: $51.5 billion. 

Record profits BEFORE regulations were removed.
8624 2018-06-24 19:05:53 I love seafood. So the smell of fish is not a problem for me, per se. It's the smell of fish cooking in mustard oil that's the issue... 
8625 2018-06-24 19:05:49 I would suggest to mix 3 tablespoons of shea butter and tablespoon of fresh aloe gel from the plant and 10 drops of each raspberry seed oil and almond oil. Hey presto, your own SPF 50

But yeah, eating can be tough lol

8735 2018-06-24 18:47:56 i got tea tree oil in my eyes
8736 2018-06-24 18:47:55 try home fries made with little red potoatoes -diced up, bell peppers cubed or thinly sliced and a beautiful yellow onion ... thinly sliced ...light olive oil, some pepper ...basil ...paprika-just a pinch, and a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.  you will never eat tater tots again
8737 2018-06-24 18:47:52 The war machine only works in this country (among others) when the personal interests of politicians and military leaders are served. Look at the 2003 Iraq invasion. That was over oil not "WMDs".
8738 2018-06-24 18:47:46 I will never shop at the Walgreens in Burlington, WA again, even if I'm getting my oil changed next door, as I have done every time since the store opened. I will never spend another dime in ANY Walgreens and I will tell every friend the reason they should not shop there, either.

8740 2018-06-24 18:47:36 YouTube is your friend. I’ve had to fix the oil pressure sensor for my ‘13 Town&Country a couple times, and learned a time-saving shortcut from a dealer mechanic. Perhaps others have experienced the same issue.
8741 2018-06-24 18:47:24 Anything cursing to do with Olive Oil should be done in an imitation of Popeye.

The people in the third group are on mute on my WhatsApp.
8743 2018-06-24 18:47:06 Who will break the news to these folks that trump takes YUGE money from gas and oil ?

He doesn't are about these people

Dad: “Oil, i tasted it”
8745 2018-06-24 18:46:53 several hours. The goal is to never get above 245 degrees. Strain the shake with a cheesecloth when it cools. Really, wait til it cools. Or else ouch. Ok then wash the crock pot or whatever you used and put the strained oil back in and raise the heat one more time for a few hours
8746 2018-06-24 18:46:52 I'll give it a try it their quality is great but dear Lord the price I use the maracuja oil to take out eyeshadow I'm tired of mincing it  we deserve lots of lacaag
8747 2018-06-24 18:46:50 It is particurlarly weird because the majority of Quebec wants to develop their own oil & gas. Not sure how @pierremoreauplq @phcouillard thinks this will save their election, they are even more behind in polls than ever. People realizing they are corrupt?
8748 2018-06-24 18:46:42 We did that with friends once. The oil flavour was too much tho xD
8749 2018-06-24 18:46:30 with one cup of your favorite fatty oil. I used a blend of coconut and avocado. Coconut is great but here in SF it turns solid because it cold. So olive oil is another great choice (unless you plan to cook at high temperatures with it). Let it slow cook on the lowest heat for

#CBDoil #bipolar
8751 2018-06-24 18:46:09 well it's ridiculous that it was even brought up! especially when there are actually charlatans out there selling actual snake oil for actual profit!
8752 2018-06-24 18:46:07 Didn't know re Costner, but show was on last night and I started to watch. Opening scene and credits propaganda against oil. I turned the channel.

8759 2018-06-24 18:45:04 A lot of Colombian oil production is heavy crude for which Canada has particular specialization in extraction and underpins production in the country. Hopefully as oil prices stabilize at higher prices they will signal to companies to jump back in.
8760 2018-06-24 18:44:59 @FullyChargedShw just what your latest excellent episode. The dirty oil city of aberdeen @AberdeenCC has now got hydrogen bin lorries and street sweepers and seems to be increasing there fleet.
8761 2018-06-24 18:44:59 Wow my head feels so much better with this tea tree oil.

8763 2018-06-24 18:44:56 Coconut oil
8764 2018-06-24 18:44:54 Conoco went into oil exploration and I believe the stock was used to fund war efforts known about prior, why this involves me does not make sense as I simply figured it out and enquired about it.

8766 2018-06-24 18:44:44 The joke is on the crude oil blackness but the human mind loves to interpret things the way it wants. They call it perception. As much as anyone wants to cause a volcanic eruption with this tweet.
8767 2018-06-24 18:44:40 The people in the third group are capable of committing murder. You can't tell me otherwise.
8768 2018-06-24 18:44:23 Oil company executives aren’t “greedy”, our industry is probably the most charitable out there, and in any event, a derailment loses huge money so it wouldn’t be in a greedy person’s interest. When you protest pipelines, while utilizing oil like everyone, you get rail transport.
8769 2018-06-24 18:44:15 It’s more than that. It’s oil companies that profit from this. They have paid GOP to roll back protections with campaign donations and other “incentives” (dark money -bribes).
8770 2018-06-24 18:44:09 Ive quickly come to realize that an offshore oil rig is basically a floating prison.

8774 2018-06-24 18:43:38 Oil companies are so irresponsible.
8775 2018-06-24 18:43:30 @Wegmans why do you carry homeopathic remedies alongside actual medications? Snake oil is snake oil despite how it's marketed.
8776 2018-06-24 18:43:20 I found tea tree oil at Walmart and the witch hazel at target!! I use the cucumber one because my face is sensitive to the rose petal one and the cucumber is more gentle
8777 2018-06-24 18:43:19 Agreed!
8778 2018-06-24 18:42:51 Nip to the shops for those and you’re sorted. It’s so good in this weather. Really good extra virgin olive oil makes a difference

8781 2018-06-24 18:42:28 Agreed we need to deal w/it at the source. But like our rotting schools,throwing money at it is not the answer.
These countries have beaches, valuable resources,gold,oil precious metals etc.
Just like Canada and US.
You know what separates them from us?
Culture,corrupt governance
8782 2018-06-24 18:42:11 But how lucrative can it be to ship oil on a train which already has a significant discount?  Doable but is it worthwhile for them?  They aren't desperate Canadians.

8786 2018-06-24 18:40:46 At least Blackadder was fictional - Westminster have not grasped that their very ignorance and inability to coherently understand the ramifications leaves the UK wide open to exploitation.  EVERY company had a "WHAT IF" scenario plan - every since the oil shocks in the 70s.

8795 2018-06-24 18:39:54 I agree 100 percent with this. Screw socialism. Let the people working keep what they earn. Instead of trying to take the moral high ground using oil money!
8796 2018-06-24 18:39:52 Why does rosehip seed oil instantly take five years off my face? What kind of sorcery ...
8797 2018-06-24 18:39:50 The debt problem isn't a thing in norway, most of their subsidies are from their oil revenues (which is being collected in a fund).

True socialism does indeed require a planned economy as Marx stated it.

8799 2018-06-24 18:39:21 Best summer recipe: Red peppers halved & deseeded.  A few chopped cherry tomatoes in each, an anchovy or two on top, & aclove of garlic crushed over each & drizzle of olive oil.  Roast in a hot oven until soft (about 12 mins).  Serve with green salad with shavings of Parmesan.

8801 2018-06-24 18:39:13 I understand your point. We’re in a divided era. And while part of me agrees with what you’re saying, another part of me can’t help but think of the old “squeaky wheel gets the oil” saying. And in this case the “oil” is attention, some of which is unwarranted/unfair

8833 2018-06-24 18:35:39 Makes perfectly good sense. Trump’s supporters swimming in oil. Why shouldn’t we?
8834 2018-06-24 18:35:38 While “We still need” is technically true, what is under debate is a massive expansion of pipeline capacity. The only reason this is in any way needed is extremely poor economic policy by the Alberta Government that has pinned their economy on oil sands expansion.
8835 2018-06-24 18:35:32 It is. It's a big failure. But there are a lot of factors. Like when we lost almost a season with Benitez. Or in the 3rd season of Mourinho when he was throwing oil into the fire when we started to fall into a bad dynamic. The players are the least questionable point.

8838 2018-06-24 18:35:10  it’s a oil that has to be burned off before cooking in it. Then burn garlic in it.. and never wash it, just wipe it out.
8839 2018-06-24 18:35:09 Oil rose to $ 150, and the price of everything rose: electricity, transportation and bread. Now oil has fallen below $ 60, and none of the above has been reduced.

8852 2018-06-24 18:33:22 No geopolitical risk premium factored into oil price at current levels. Should be $6-$10 higher.

8875 2018-06-24 18:30:00 Frost? Frost is to do with clear skies in winter. You liars really do try to make everything fit your snake oil. None of you have given a shred of evidence the sun is in/entering a GSM. Why is that, Daave? Because there isn’t a GSM which would cool 0.13–0.3°C tops?
8876 2018-06-24 18:29:54 Selling his snake oil, needs his tax breaks and needs to keep his money coming in and the Tories need him.

8881 2018-06-24 18:28:49 Women driving in Saudi Arabia maybe a step forward but don’t kid yourself this is not a regime equal rights. And yet Canada still buys Oil from them @jkenney @CanadaAction @JustinTrudeau @ABPOLITICS123 @cathmckenna
8882 2018-06-24 18:28:38 How about rubber?  Steel?  Cotton?  Bauxite? Copper?  YOu got a whole lot of strategic oil reserves in scotland there danks?
8883 2018-06-24 18:28:30 Maybe a pipeline would be a better way to transport oil?  Oh, wait NDP prefers trains.
8884 2018-06-24 18:28:22 Try using Skin So Soft body oil. I swear I was always getting gang raped by them. LOL!! Not lately though. I just mix it in with my regular lotion.

What was Trump thinking!

8890 2018-06-24 18:27:53 I make a balsamic vinegar and oil dressing with red onion, chopped tomato, spinach and feta or goats cheese (sometimes add roasted butternut squash with chilli) - normally delicious.
8891 2018-06-24 18:27:36 I oil and massage my scalp like every other day, I wash & deep condition every Sunday and water wash in the middle of the week. I’m doing some crochets one of these days before I leave on the 12th
8892 2018-06-24 18:27:34 Imagine one of these motherfuckers seasoned with olive oil, garlic and chilli.
8893 2018-06-24 18:27:21 Na oil well dey the land 
8894 2018-06-24 18:27:14 See previously oxygen therapy and coconut oil. Turmeric is currently making quite cross!
8895 2018-06-24 18:27:09 "No. I haven't." Said him while put the oil lamp to the bookshelf.
8896 2018-06-24 18:27:06 Filled oil tanker was fall in Punjab.Regional people came & theft oil.Suddenly a balst occurred in the tanker.& the thieves die.& the government pay 3million to every thief.While RAnwar killed Naqeeb in extra judiciary Case.JIT declared RAnwar killer& responsible.#but_he_is_free.
8897 2018-06-24 18:27:03 There’s more than enough water in the ocean, with sea levels rising.

There’s an abundance of renewable energy throughout the desert.

So if we can pipe oil from Canada to Houston, we can pipe ocean water to the desert & desalinate locally.

8901 2018-06-24 18:26:23 oil hi daala hai naa? doubtful case 
8902 2018-06-24 18:25:56 Thank god there isn't an unsafe pipeline underground to transport oil..........trains and trucks are foolproof
8903 2018-06-24 18:25:33 Very true... welding, automotive, electrician, carpenter, mechanics, plumbing, trucking, heavy equipment operators, oil rig workers, airline pilots, EMT’s, police, firefighter and more need no degrees yet make excellent wages...
8904 2018-06-24 18:25:28 Stigma is still here. An example is my own beautiful wife. I asked her, "Next Christmas will it be acceptable to vape my medicine?" She wrinkled her nose a bit fearful of the reaction from family  (her mom uses cannabis oil for hip pain too). Still years away from acceptance.
8905 2018-06-24 18:25:27 Was there an oil spill?
8906 2018-06-24 18:25:15 "Well not exactly, now that you mention it I usually either put hair gel or oil shine with coconut scent."
8907 2018-06-24 18:25:02 I'm glad I know coconut oil just melt makeup off the face, I'm also glad it doesn't have any adverse effects on my skin UWU
8908 2018-06-24 18:24:59 I don't eat v junk food like US & UK vegans. 
But when I saw for the 1st tim about ethese products in vegan groups, I was curious to see how it taste.
Taste is good but expensive. 
But I stop oreos becos of possibility of traces of dairy & palm oil, altho some vegans but them.
8909 2018-06-24 18:24:58 aww im so glad i got to meet you,, it was an amAzing experience and ill never forget it :)))

8913 2018-06-24 18:24:01 I can remember something about it coasting just over £1 a gallon with the cost of oil at just over $50 a barrel. Funny how we just learn to live with things.
8914 2018-06-24 18:24:00 Steel? Okay. The process of mixing ores. Ores are located in the earth. As are gemstones. Gold. Silver. Crude oil. Rock makes a great foundation. Sand not no good for building on. All of which are great topics of conversation.
8915 2018-06-24 18:23:42 Trump, in case you missed it, is removing most of the laws regulating ocean drilling. Remember those beautiful sand beaches which will soon turn into oil dumps?

8917 2018-06-24 18:23:33 Q: Has anyone of you used CBD Oil internally, topically or via camping?
8918 2018-06-24 18:23:28 Tonight I'm going to pre-poo with my mom's olive oil 
8919 2018-06-24 18:23:25 Mike's views on trading are very good and I agree with almost everything he says. I don't subscribe to MMT or any of Mike's economic theories, they don't make any sense. If Government could set oil price then why wouldn't they make it US$1/ barrel? The cheaper the better, right?
8920 2018-06-24 18:22:43 #fakedinosaurfacts  Die in the Ocean they make Limestone. Die on land, they make Liquid Oil . What kind of sense does that make ??
8921 2018-06-24 18:22:35 The good thing about snake oil salespeople is they sell. At times internal stakeholders will be shouting out the solution but it takes a salesperson to convince the board. And at times that’s a consultant
8922 2018-06-24 18:22:33 Oil change and then going camping
8923 2018-06-24 18:22:30 I know taking fish oil omega 3 is good for you & shit but the burps afterwards fuckin suck... literally taste fish on every burp

8928 2018-06-24 18:22:08 You mean our oil, wind and hydro, our land and deep water docks and the extremely well educated people we just keep sending down to the south east?  Not to mention our trade surplus? And most of England’s in economic mess
8929 2018-06-24 18:22:00 Fried lightly in coconut oil. Was brilliant. Fun fact: was still damn good well after its “best by” date. I felt vindicated after getting The Glare of Judgment from an older gent in the supermarket when I was buying it months earlier
8930 2018-06-24 18:21:46 I know. I was joking with that tweet, people obviously don't see the crude oil joke.
8931 2018-06-24 18:21:43 Ooh ... i have all these things in #woodandbell garden... except the feta and olive oil, obvs!!!!!
8932 2018-06-24 18:21:22 @BBCCountryfile unfortunately we are the masters of our own destiny on Cso and polllution into rivers as you’ve said sanitary towels they don’t break down and oil and other contaminated things tipped into sewers and drains, water companies can’t take all the blame
8933 2018-06-24 18:21:02 Boycott Alberta. Calgary is  the dirty oil capital of Canada. Just don't go there.

8937 2018-06-24 18:20:43 I have quite a few friends who are taking cannabis oil because of various illnesses. And they all say it makes a difference to there health.
8938 2018-06-24 18:20:28 I ordered a couple of items from their on-line store. Spice-rub and olive oil crackers. I’m not sure if I’ll keep them or give them as gifts. I’m sure they’re tasty!
8939 2018-06-24 18:20:28 And let's also talk about how he is still bombing in the middle east even more than Obama and Bush. The US is the number one oil producer in the world and most of our oil imports come from Canada. It's time to leave the middle east and focus on our own country
8940 2018-06-24 18:20:25 Nothing but lies you spout, lets talk about the mysterious 22 oil paintings,...
8941 2018-06-24 18:20:10 And we put the town down and sunbathed for in the garden for ages on a towl with cooking oil on 
8942 2018-06-24 18:19:50 If you're raised with meat,then cut it out it's usually for ethical reasons, not taste. If you cooked chicken with no oil and seasons it'd taste like rubber,you add plant food to give it taste, it's the same principle with fake meat. It still tastes good but not at a moral cost
8943 2018-06-24 18:19:46 My Dad taught me how to throw a ball, change my oil, shoot a gun and kick your ass.  #BadBecause

8945 2018-06-24 18:19:34 Yes, that’s oil going in.
8946 2018-06-24 18:19:31 Never take into account co2 from oil drilling, petrol production and delivery and assume all electricity is produced by burning coal. Paid by oil companies perhaps?

He pulled back his hand and went to turn off the oil lamp on the edge of window regardless of the new nickname you use. He would try to ignore such stuff starting today.
8949 2018-06-24 18:19:13 hey thanks Ben, much appreciated. I "wet-sand" with boiled linseed (that's all it's got in this image) and then a coat of beeswax once the oil has set - a satin finish that's food-safe. maple does crazy stuff :)
8950 2018-06-24 18:19:13 I don't know how dem can keep Bernie out if he registers as dem. I hope he runs as an independent. I think he can win esp against Trump & prob against the neolibs the DNC is backing. Dems take money from whomever offers it-just like the Rep-even oil $ & in some cases NRA.

8987 2018-06-24 18:15:59 honestly! what makes them think that pouring oil into the ocean and catching it on fire is okay?
8988 2018-06-24 18:15:44 Something very very gentle but moisturising is best. Oats with water are good for redness and irritation, and some kind of oil, like coconut oil you leave on for like an hour before wiping off, may be a good idea

9000 2018-06-24 18:14:17 Problem is, snake oil salesmen rebrand themselves after some time has passed, and the same rubes buy the same repackaged crap. I hope that the fight we're in right now changes this cycle of idiocracy, but my confidence level is low.

9016 2018-06-24 18:10:42 WHAT #grandsolarminimum? You snake oil sellers bandy the term about but never give a shred of evidence the sun is in/entering a GSM.

In any case, 0.13–0.3°C cooling from a GSM, pffffft, we have warmed nearly 2°C from the LIA. AGW would wipe out the cooling very quickly!

9018 2018-06-24 18:10:27 I haven't talked about cod liver oil in a while...

Is cod liver oil the bestest thing ever

9020 2018-06-24 18:10:05 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
9021 2018-06-24 18:10:00 Jesus anointed the blind man with spit and dirt, but he gives us the privilege of using oil instead. Oil from olives--crushed and refined-- is used to illuminate, to feed, to gladden, and by faith, to ask God to heal.  

How precious is that oil.
9022 2018-06-24 18:09:55 How is Bobby doing this season, Bob ?
9023 2018-06-24 18:09:53 sos how do you know if you need oil in your carrrrr
9024 2018-06-24 18:09:41 His hair is bleached he needs oil
9025 2018-06-24 18:09:39 I just witnessed a lady come up to give the pastor oil from a smoking vape. Atleast she has oil #whitepeople
9026 2018-06-24 18:09:30 Mentally preparing myself to soak my hair in Jamaican Black Castor Oil Extra Dark as a hot oil treatment so I can do my hair finally. This shit smells like Ashes and my YouTuber's did not warn me of this.
9027 2018-06-24 18:09:27 Give her a full body massage with oil as friends
9028 2018-06-24 18:09:19 I am a man of many faces so I feel as if I could be of very good service. I also make a lovely tea and I have cod liver oil on me at all times with a packet of jaffa cakes just in case
9029 2018-06-24 18:09:02 I hope they gave you food not oil!  We ended up having a meal in a restaurant at Waterloo before we caught a train home.
9030 2018-06-24 18:08:51 Oil on top of more oil :( tae about to give grease a new definition
9031 2018-06-24 18:08:47 I usually just put them in the pan. Without any added oil. It cooks in it's own fat perfectly crispy 
9032 2018-06-24 18:08:42 See we are complex. Our food is complex and tells so much of our story and history.  I think about how I struggled with the portion sizes and the "rice with everything" in Lagos. I struggles to appreciate palm oil ... but I looked around the table, at the people and I had to
9033 2018-06-24 18:08:35 Me too. CBD oil results are variable and related to strength, which varies wildly between products. Probably, like dope, it works for some more than others too.
9034 2018-06-24 18:08:29 Okay so I still got 5 artist canvas here in different sizes.
What should I do with them?
Get out my acrylic paint
Buy oil paint and try that for first time
Cover themvwith watercolor paper and stay with watercolor?
9035 2018-06-24 18:08:24 Wearing patchouli oil in public should be at least a misdemeanor
9036 2018-06-24 18:08:19 I'd like to know too,
9037 2018-06-24 18:08:17 I see him as a chump, a snake oil salesman a con artist..... and he has supporters, which boggles my mind.  And I'm not alone
9038 2018-06-24 18:08:17 Dude leaked a quart of oil rounding second
9039 2018-06-24 18:08:16 I've never tried it with oil :o it's probably healthier with like olive oil on top
9040 2018-06-24 18:08:03 And if you tray bake a load of veg (butternut squash, potatoes, carrots, parsnips) in oil and maple syrup, putting them in for the last few minutes soaks up the juices and flavours them. But that’s not v summery.
9041 2018-06-24 18:07:50 How disgusting coming from a snake oil quasi minster.  #TrumpEpstein #TrumpCrimeFamily #TrumpConcentrationCamps #tRumpCultists #TrumpPutin #IQ45

9046 2018-06-24 18:07:34 this is the whitest sentence i've seen since cannabis oil for dogs
9047 2018-06-24 18:07:30 Gas four dollars a gallon. Didn't the oil companies get billions in tax cuts? Nice to see that trickle down. Also, children in cages.
9048 2018-06-24 18:07:30 why can’t wic pass? Bad air? Too narrow? Too slippery
9049 2018-06-24 18:07:25 Cleanliness is your main problem with Bengalis? Not mustard oil? If you do not begin smelling the aroma of Mustard oil from the day you are born, impossible to stomach the stuff.

9051 2018-06-24 18:07:14 Well, it would depend on whether they have oil.
9052 2018-06-24 18:06:59 My car may be drinking an absurd amount of oil, I still love it. ITS SO MUCH FUN TO DRIVE.
9053 2018-06-24 18:06:54 A new discovery to me (I'm reviewing the Peak Oil release). It's so good!
9054 2018-06-24 18:06:54 I hate when my sauce whines.  Anywho, easy solution.  Had same issue.  Pull off what will easily come off, then use olive oil and a razor blade to remove the rest.  Stove top was like new after that.
9055 2018-06-24 18:06:47 That seems to indicate that we should twin the railway then anyways.

Because oil for some reason is over capacity filling everything?

Even if we upgrade the pipeline, are we not going to have the same discussion about upgrading it again in 5 years?
9056 2018-06-24 18:06:32 the smell of turpentine oil is making me dizzy again... but I need to keep painting or else I'll never finish my projects on time for my exam
9057 2018-06-24 18:06:19 "Naw. The Chosen One did that when he blew up the Enclave oil rig.I can take you to meet Frank if you want."
9058 2018-06-24 18:06:13 I had the craaaaziest dream last night that I struck oil
9059 2018-06-24 18:06:12 I wonder what we’d be saying if the oil sands were in Manitoba.  #ableg #entitlement

9061 2018-06-24 18:06:02 Bill is a snake oil salesman. His reverse mortgage pitch is just as bad because it leads people to believe that home equity is a great way to get money. Instead it’s a great way to get deeper into personal debt.
9062 2018-06-24 18:04:55 //oil ocean zone is now in my head, thanks red

i fucking love that theme though

i love all of sonic mania's music
9063 2018-06-24 18:04:53 It's the new coconut oil in the dog community.
9064 2018-06-24 18:04:51 My mommy had to stay up all night and walk her horse around the stable and ring cause her horse got bloat. She said they put a tub down his throat and pumped in olive oil. Then he would pass gas when he kept walking.
9065 2018-06-24 18:04:46 Yes. And much of what is coming out is so light it isn’t technically oil, although EIA seems to count it as such. Also, the entire shale boom is dependent on extremely loose monetary policy and ever increasing debt which is not sustainable In my opinion.
9066 2018-06-24 18:04:41 That aint a igloo thats my watch
And that ain't snow baby thats my chainThats not a ice tray thats my teethAnd thats not a snow cone thats my ringThat aint KoolAid up in my cup I stay sipping that purple oil
I stay flipping the slab on fours

9067 2018-06-24 18:04:38 What is worse? Water supply in Flint, MI… or Brain Eating Amoebas Found in water source Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana? This is why we need the EPA. What is your POTUS and your Representatives doing to protect your drinking water? Why are some so eager to put oil pipelines down?
9068 2018-06-24 18:04:19 Oh snap  for a face moisturizer i use jojoba oil, it mimics natural skin oils but also has some cleansing properties!   and a little goes a long way

PUSHES SAMUS INTO THE FUCKING BURNING OIL
9071 2018-06-24 18:03:14 holy horseshit batman.  not only is this article based on a false equivalency, but it suggests that we’re pushing these poor sods to be racist.  first, with muslims:  we’ve meddled in their governments and economies for decades for the sake of oil, and to their detriment. —>
9072 2018-06-24 18:03:10 Oven baked marrow bone on toast, lightly drizzled with the oil *kibble & tinned meat will never be the same again* 
9073 2018-06-24 18:03:07 The rising gas prices are due to oil and trade policy.
Taxes are already beginning to fall for the rich and rise for everyone else.
Minimum wage has failed to climb proportionally with cost of living.

These are not results of liberal policies.
9074 2018-06-24 18:02:57 Put coolant and oil into my mom's car only because her and my brother don't have jobs so they have no money to buy them and that's my mom so hell yeah dawg. 
9075 2018-06-24 18:02:39 That's a quality choice! I'm partial to coc but people scream that's like drinking suntan oil but I don't care???
9076 2018-06-24 18:02:28 Oil. 
9077 2018-06-24 18:02:16 Sorry that was bushs retirement gift to himself/oil barons when Obama took office it dropped to $2?? Then under $2

9084 2018-06-24 18:01:18 Thanks for selling Texas out - again - to oil and gas companies that destroy our lands, waters and air. Some legacy you leave behind for the grandkids. #CantDrinkOil #CleanWaterAction #EPA
9085 2018-06-24 18:01:17 ..oil change on a Sunday went smooth, now to wash clothes & clean up my house before my game today
9086 2018-06-24 18:01:09 Also one of the benefits of working in home studio. I detoxed my studio & use no petroluem based solvents at all any more. The binder in oil paints (linseed or walnut oil) is not the problem. It's the solvents many people clean brushes with-mineral oil, citrus & soy products only

9088 2018-06-24 18:01:01 I haven’t see even one. I live in Indiana. Is it a geographically targeted campaign? My friends in Morgan City, LA probably can’t get away from them.
9089 2018-06-24 18:00:53 IF THE POOL HAS FUCKING OIL IN IT AND IT'S ON FIRE THEN IT'S GOING TO FUCKING EXPLODE
9090 2018-06-24 18:00:41 There is no such thing as "honest debate" anymore. It's a delay tactic by Big Oil and the politicians in their pocket. The only debate is "How" we do it. Plenty of conservative economists agree as do most big business leaders. It's the House of Trump that is stealing the future.

I thought you guys just got done defending the right of a business owner to choose their clientele?
A business chose their clientele, you weren’t it.
How’s the dog?
9093 2018-06-24 18:00:07 Did they really think trump was pro environment? He talked about oil and natural gas repeatedly during the campaign

9095 2018-06-24 17:59:55 Loool fammm haba...No oil on the land o
9096 2018-06-24 17:59:46 It can’t have anything to do with stigma because the oil industry is looked at badly as well. Both are huge money makers and Texas loves its revenue sources!
9097 2018-06-24 17:59:31 It’s a Disgrace.   Heating oil is from 100 to 150 cheaper to buy in NI depending on exchange rate.  Now Leo wants to put more tax on it here.  Then SF wants a United Ireland.  NI people will get a big shock if they come under Dublin rule.
9098 2018-06-24 17:59:17 Darby and David need an oil change so do I do we just all make Darby schedule it for us hahaha #thanksmom

9101 2018-06-24 17:58:58 Oh I am just listening to David Icke talking about cannabis oil and that sick child who needed it to stop him having convulsions, and I read on an articule where an actress rubbed this oil on her feet so she could walk in heels with out pain, it is natural. Must not smoke it 
9102 2018-06-24 17:58:42 This is why you need to keep up with your oil, Ken. You know.

9115 2018-06-24 17:56:54 The formula that's working great for sleep for me right now is: full meal at sundown after being active for at least one hour each day-as much as I can. Plus Ashwaghanda (also called Holy Basil), plus 2 fish oils or a shot of olive oil, plus 1 vitamin D, plus magnesium.
9116 2018-06-24 17:56:44 Aahhh the smell of truffle oil and parmesan... ah italia I miss you 
9117 2018-06-24 17:56:38 I would recommend the R3 ('09-12) if you intend to stay stock - they added some additionals which make a big difference (extra oil injectors, uprated suspension, less rust-prone bodywork). '03-'08 good if you'd rather tinker & improve. Lower road tax band too. #RotaryFun

9120 2018-06-24 17:56:22 We should empathize - I mean if your country was being invaded (Iraq) and then stole your resources (oil, historic archeology) and committed crimes and acted like they owned the place, and lowered the property value, and tried to influence elections - you'd be pissed too.
9121 2018-06-24 17:56:19 LOL  . Did you have to mix oil in with the gas to get the exhaust to look like that ?
9122 2018-06-24 17:56:11 I’ve had this KIA fo almost 4 years with all my oil changes. Always great service with 100% communication unlike other dealerships like Spirit.  The service writers are great guys.

9125 2018-06-24 17:55:02 My gf has been a vegan the last year. She also doesn't consume flour, sugar, oil, or salt. I'm in awe of her and slightly sad for someone having that kind of diet. Works for her though and that's all that matters. :)
9126 2018-06-24 17:54:55 Yeah, that's just what we need. Less protection from oil spills. There's a huge oil-spill lobby out there fighting for more oil spills.
9127 2018-06-24 17:54:48 It's our own and you can also use it to produce sugar and cooking oil unless you're fond of relying on imported food. Huya ndikupe , munda urime ndiri Sabhuku
9128 2018-06-24 17:54:42 Wow, that's embarrassing. I think its irresponsible to tell people it's going to the moon when you have no idea. It could easily go to 2k and stay there for the year because of no market confidence. You're preying on people that are down amd hurting. You're a snake oil salesman.
9129 2018-06-24 17:54:23 Engine blown up on my #Jaguar #FTYPE due to wrong oil used during its last service at @Jaguar MK. Do not expect to buy my dream car, receive this level of customer service, be without a car for 9 weeks & be told @JaguarUK will not do anything to help. Disgusting @JaguarUKPR
9130 2018-06-24 17:54:22 I’ve just swapped from years of @fakebakeunited fake tan (£30ish a bottle) to @superdrug ‘s ‘solait’ range (I just got a dry oil, x2 mousse, a mist for less than a tenner in a deal) and IM NEVER GOING BACK it’s JUST as good I can’t believe it
9131 2018-06-24 17:54:18 Oil oil and oil and Israhell
9132 2018-06-24 17:54:02 The loudest wheel may get the oil but that doesn’t mean it will be fixed. It just may need to be replaced altogether.
9133 2018-06-24 17:53:54 This is so deep, we can discover oil here
9134 2018-06-24 17:53:28 The study was on potatoes and the people that ate the ones drenched in oil died earlier. Surprise!

9136 2018-06-24 17:53:13 I bet he didn't mean what U think of, if U check his personal occupation, he got a thriving business that he loved so much & will sustain him. Moreover, he worked with oil company in Warri and later resigned by choice. So to my own perspective, the hustles is 4 the better Nigeria

9147 2018-06-24 17:51:01 Our case is not that oil spills, deforestation and global poverty are the result of overpopulation - it's that overpopulation contributes to them, makes them worse and makes them more difficult to solve. Reducing, though ethical means, the number of people born helps us all.
9148 2018-06-24 17:50:50 Oh Wow o.O
I managed to pretty much use up the 5Liter can of Extra virgin olive oil that I bought last year in October.

9151 2018-06-24 17:50:34 Yes. I mean, I may not be immune to woo ideas yet - I've recently bought some CBD oil *just to see*. I haven't tried it yet. It may help, it may be another way I wasted some money. I am pretty skeptical of anything without 8 tonnes of evidence these days, but still get sucked in!

9159 2018-06-24 17:49:58 Look, if you overhear me talking about my kid's seizure disorder? That is not an invitation to try and promote your bullshit MLM snake oil business to me, mkay?

9176 2018-06-24 17:48:07 umm sponsored by oil companies?
9177 2018-06-24 17:48:06 In all likelihood, settler ideology around ~~land~~ and assorted other racist baggage made that whole development strategy viable in the first place, but yeah, oil/car executives helped, too.

It's yikes all the way down.
9178 2018-06-24 17:48:04 Did you see his bit comparing XRP to Oil?

“Saudi Arabia has a lot of oil, doesn’t mean they control oil”
9179 2018-06-24 17:48:01 Use black soap when you wash your face. Also you can use aloe, tea tree oil, and lemon as a spot treatment
9180 2018-06-24 17:47:49 I’ve heard a lot about jojoba oil tbh and it’s supposed to be good Idk about mixing them all though

9182 2018-06-24 17:47:40 except opec won't because they are to busy lining their pockets with the excess in the name of "conserving oil"
9183 2018-06-24 17:47:34 It's mandatory. 
Mr. President, impose a 35% remittance tax to all US remittances going to Mexico. Mexican economy first source of income are US remittances above oil, mining, agriculture...Mexico as a country can't survive without US remittances.........

9195 2018-06-24 17:46:08  Elizabeth Brussels sprouts are  the only way I can eat them is if they are roasted with olive oil and garlic salt and they have to be pretty much almost burnt and crispy before I can even attempt!
9196 2018-06-24 17:46:04 I’m not judging anyone on their favorite condiments, I’m just saying I think it’s gross and it contains soybean oil. Make your own at home. @AlphaAchillesX and @brdlysllrs have the right ideas, even if they disagree

9200 2018-06-24 17:45:32 The US gas and oil industry emits 13 million metric tons of methane from its operations each year - nearly 60% more than estimated by the EPA. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with more than 80 times the climate warming impact of carbon dioxide.
9201 2018-06-24 17:45:28 If your wooden doors are sticking due to humidity, rub a light coat of vegetable oil between the door and door jamb.
9202 2018-06-24 17:45:25 We can always do with better informed GPs, & less misinformed too (eg that many advise against use of HRT at menopause & later). 

Incidentally, your Pill contains a progestogen, not progesterone - which has to be in oil, so cannot fit in pills, & has different effects.
9203 2018-06-24 17:45:12 burping fish oil is not the biz
9204 2018-06-24 17:45:11 Working on an oil rig at night is an extreme sport.

9206 2018-06-24 17:45:04 Not entirely sure who thought building huge chunks of cities in such a way as to be exclusively accessible by car was a good idea other than oil executives and people in their pockets, personally.

... I just answered my own question, didn't I.
9207 2018-06-24 17:45:01 God forbid we have a massive oil spill similar to BP or worse. What will be Trump’s and @EPAScottPruitt response? There is no way in hell they will be allowed to blame anyone but themselves.
9208 2018-06-24 17:44:54 use baby oil!!!! it works so well xxx
9209 2018-06-24 17:44:50 @whitehouse has become a funhouse for white supremacists. Gold coins with glorious leaders golf course, 1500 fountain pens, drilling for oil in formerly protected waters. What a showing of weakness from the USA. #Resist
9210 2018-06-24 17:44:37 ... and their access to oil in the Gulf with partition.

9218 2018-06-24 17:43:57 I think they might mean more as in oil field workers because there is hella out field workers during the summer and more $$$ lol
9219 2018-06-24 17:43:56 One day imma learn my lesson about cooking shirtless with hot oil on the stove popping. All I can see is that shit hurt
9220 2018-06-24 17:43:52 That’s what i was gonna do. I need to order the chili flakes. But i wanted to do it the vegan way without the fish oil and extra stuff
9221 2018-06-24 17:43:52 @BeavertownBeer hi, debeauvoir. Going to a wedding in Fermanagh in Aug and would like to send som beer for the party. What do you suggest? Thinking of a Neck Oil keg or similar

9226 2018-06-24 17:43:06 Hoping my boyfriends dad can get some Cannabis oil when it becomes legal to help his shakes with his Parkinson’s 
9227 2018-06-24 17:43:00 mmmm, somebody come take my car to get an oil change I’m not tryna go no where 
9228 2018-06-24 17:42:39 You ion need no mo of dat oil boy 
9229 2018-06-24 17:42:31 Is there a more "extreme" version of trump possibly on horizon? Feel like the ante is constantly being upped.
9230 2018-06-24 17:42:12 On hold. Oil on the course @PPIHC
9231 2018-06-24 17:42:11 I should’ve sold cocaine after H.S. and then live comfortably in Venezuela laundering money through an oil refinery. Post-grad depression is really woeful...
9232 2018-06-24 17:41:22 But you need land to produce raw materials for sugar and cooking oil. It's not your fault ,you are used to imported food and you still think you can not produce the goods locally
9233 2018-06-24 17:41:18 When the farmers get hurt, we all get hurt. I’m sorry they fell for the snake oil salesman, but now we have to somehow work ourselves out of this s-hole. I won’t be happy about it but the alternative is worse.
9234 2018-06-24 17:41:12 Maybe one day :) until then I'll mask bad pizza with chili oil and chicken 
9235 2018-06-24 17:41:06 What does this mean for gas price in Texas? We've been stuck in the Obama gas prices since Hurricane Harvey intead of the Trump gas prices which were low like the Bush days. Those oil companies have robbed Texans and with possible new hurricanes it could get worse.
9236 2018-06-24 17:41:01 Burns so easily though. Then it goes acrid and RUINS sesame oil for you 4ever.
9237 2018-06-24 17:40:41 I’m hearing one of the oldest cars competing today - a 1966 Shelby Cobra driven by Layne Schranz suffered an oil spill, causing a delay.
9238 2018-06-24 17:40:06 The other Travis Allen would say we in CA have high gas prices is because of a user fee on gas to fix our broken infrastructure.   (not because of the rise of oil prices over welshing on the Iran deal.

9240 2018-06-24 17:39:56 I think the conditions for an uprising are there but people remain apprehensive, the next general election could be a turning point for us. Also the circumstances that have kept Boutaflika in power are no the same, the price of oil/gas are not as high as they were...
9241 2018-06-24 17:39:42 He “captured young people hearts” by promising them free college and healthcare. Bernie couldn’t even get a majority of his coworkers in the progressive caucus to endorse him. The idea that he could realistically bring faster change via congress was always snake oil hucksterism.
9242 2018-06-24 17:39:31 Melania plagiarized Michelle.

Trump plagiarized Obama economy...

...except tariffs, taxfraudbill, higher oil prices, higher interest rates.
9243 2018-06-24 17:39:28 You have it all wrong. I don’t know q but let me ask a question. The current regime has 1.6 billion USD. The Iranian people want to use the petro yuan/gold/etc. for oil. The current regime won’t support that. This is not a game, we are talking about reservecurrency status change.
9244 2018-06-24 17:39:27 What's crazy is how much system (insurers, patients, etc) already pays for (IMHO snake oil) non-generic opioid options, formulations.

9249 2018-06-24 17:38:43 Why is MS-13 suddenly what every one is supposed to be afraid of? Does El Salvador have oil now? Last I checked, the biggest killer of white people in America was still heart disease.
9250 2018-06-24 17:38:42 In my opinion, the employed should be trained for the job. For example, in an oil company, they test you on maths, abstract reasoning and English, if you pass, they employ you and train you for the job. They assume you don't know anything about the position you were employed for
9251 2018-06-24 17:38:41 But that's the whole point.  Kids in cages took second place to her jacket ferchrissakes!!  Why?  BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT TRUMP WANTED!  That was deliberate so that people wouldn't focus on oil spills, losing healthcare and missing children.
9252 2018-06-24 17:38:37 No you need some oregano drops with black seed oil LOL
9253 2018-06-24 17:38:33 Funny haven't seen any of that. Gas prices up my wage increase was just erased by my healthcare plan increases...and oil prices climbing that's how I heat my house.
9254 2018-06-24 17:38:29 Mas definito! I get my dose of heat from McCormick's Montreal Seasoning (spicy) that also has notes of cumin, cayenne, cracked pepper & other good stuff. 
A few drops of lemon infused olive oil ... 
and BAM!

H/T Emeril.
9255 2018-06-24 17:38:26 I your endeavours. Until humanity/society changes its demands, farms/ranches are needed & those that are family run, IMHO, are better. Interesting to read the detractors. I live where oil is produced.People still use oil products but protest infrastructure to get the oil out.
9256 2018-06-24 17:38:23 The Carrizo Plain is one of the most beautiful open places I have ever been to. I will fight HARD to protect it. #NativeCalifornian for four generations, STAY AWAY FROM OUR LAND w/ your development and oil!

9258 2018-06-24 17:37:48 I’m happy that we give immigrants the same rights like everyone else. That’s a fair treatment! 
Which country is responsible for the last 2 wars based on fake facts for oil? BTW these 2 wars are major responsible for the highest count of refugees in the world at this time.
9259 2018-06-24 17:37:45 Private Jails, such as CCA (Correction Corporation of America) os owned amd maintain by Texas Oil families. 

They have lobbyists in Congress. It takes a minimum of 60 days, just to see an Immigration judge..

All to keep them at FULL CAPACITY!

9263 2018-06-24 17:36:48 That chili oil looks fantastic, I guess I'll need to do that.
9264 2018-06-24 17:36:38 CHURCH WAS GREAT TODAY, JUST DRINK SOME JAMAICA  COCONUT OIL IS WONDERFUL.
9265 2018-06-24 17:36:35 As a veteran who got out in 98, I also went to protest Iraq invasion cause I knew it was about oil not freedom.  Where were you at?   Also went to anti FTAA protests 07, which is big reason for increase in immigration, guessing you didn’t even know?
9266 2018-06-24 17:36:15 Bc disgruntled self-aggrandizer Comey & snake oil salesman  Schumer cried foul & convinced pencil neck bureaucrat Rosenstein to hire a special counsel bc Trump fired his own subordinate—who ironically was recommended to be fired by...Rosenstein. If I’m not right I’m damn close.
9267 2018-06-24 17:35:55 I just got a DM from an oil baron in South Africa so see ya later, losers.
9268 2018-06-24 17:35:42 Haha, crazy. 

Not sure if they're cooked in lard, but you can get crazy good fish and chips in Seattle at a place called Little Chinooks, off Salmon Bay by the marina. If you're ever there, it's worth the trip. It's even worth the seed oil dose.
9269 2018-06-24 17:35:33 Closing shift today, then a BUSY day tomorrow around the house and out. Hoping to get the backyard mowed & my oil changed, then going to spend most of the day watching the rest of E3 conferences. Still a LOT left to see!!!
9270 2018-06-24 17:35:29 CBD oil has been great for my anxiety, I always want to talk to people and now I can actually do it.
9271 2018-06-24 17:35:23 @GOP like little wussy. If the GOP doesn't fight back now, you will lose the house & maybe the senate.  DEM-O-RATS will impeach President Trump raise our taxes, close coal, natural gas & oil, make us dependent on middle east, lose thousands of jobs, add many more regulations....
9272 2018-06-24 17:35:16 Oil then? Sewage?
9273 2018-06-24 17:34:55 @GNev2 who’s bright idea was it to put @HKane on corners in 2016 numpty #GoldenBoot #Russia2018 #WorldCup
9274 2018-06-24 17:34:49 So avoid Skippy Peanut Butter. They use Palm oil. Shame on them.
9275 2018-06-24 17:34:41 I showered at Michaels & I didn’t put oil in my hair for my curls after three months of saturating my dry dead curls in coconut oil & MY CURLS LOOK SO FUCKING CUTE BITCH
9276 2018-06-24 17:34:41 regardless if we kill them or not, they’re going to die, they can sit there and let themselves get killed by the oil, or go and adapt to other waters, they have a lot more water to swim in then we know of to drill at
9277 2018-06-24 17:34:41 woy aku baru checkout yang rosehip sama ricebran barusaaan banget bayarnya sunflo efeknya apa emang? tanya ke admin disaranin 2 oil doanq
9278 2018-06-24 17:34:25 Get some jojoba oil and rub it in to you cuticles and under your nail. It'll help.
9279 2018-06-24 17:34:23 It's still to hi oil down right now it shouldn't be this high.
9280 2018-06-24 17:34:18 Lmaoooooooooooo.

Don't slander greatness.

Red oil and sugar is awesome
9281 2018-06-24 17:34:16 Fill er up, and check the oil please...
9282 2018-06-24 17:34:16 So on @carteblanchetv the illegal guns used for poaching are sold white owned companies who also own oil contracts; offcourse allowed by their respecting office bearers in African countries 
So next time we talk corruption let’s not forget it takes two to tango
9283 2018-06-24 17:34:15 I’ve switched back to Oil of Olay products (face wash & moisturizer) from Simple, added a Garnier clay/charcoal scrub, & bought more witch hazel for toning. I may go back to Aveeno Simply Radiant because I’m getting darker freckles. I’ll show you at CEO. ;) #whatsinmybag

9286 2018-06-24 17:33:53 This has tremendous import to those of us in south Louisiana, where oil spills are common--in the river, nearshore, and in deepwater. #DeepwaterHorizon
9287 2018-06-24 17:33:49 I have a pretty fun hula cardio video I use on rainy days

9290 2018-06-24 17:33:17 I'm going to start using balsamic vinegar in more marinades. I created a salt free marinade for split chicken breasts with vegetable oil, freshly cracked black pepper, balsamic vinegar, garlic, onion, and Italian herbs.

9294 2018-06-24 17:32:52 They don't buy land with oil it doesn't work that way and a land of 120m as at now would have been a high brow area from inception so it won't have ever been cheap to start with not to talk of 350k
9295 2018-06-24 17:32:33 Also this flower extract in coconut oil is very good for hair
9296 2018-06-24 17:32:31 My brother gave me black seed oil from the health place and has been begging me not to break it because it’s so expensive... he thinks I spoil things on purpose 
9297 2018-06-24 17:32:17 Mosquitos don't like peppermint. Buy some olive oil & add about 2-3 drops of peppermint oil to it. Smells better than the bug repellent on the market.
9298 2018-06-24 17:32:11 Stainless steel appliances seem to be stained with fingerprints constantly. So to give them a good, clean shine, I tk microfiber cloth n a few drops of olive oil! #SelfCleanWithHaier

9303 2018-06-24 17:31:24 Animals killing other animals is just all part of the food chain. That happens. We can’t prevent that. But what we can prevent as humans is stopped oil or other non-natural things from killing animals. But the alt-right doesn’t seem to care about that
9304 2018-06-24 17:31:17 @CrazyRxMan So a patient asked for a bottle of Minute Made Fish Oil.  Of course I asked her if she wanted orange or lemonade flavor...

9313 2018-06-24 17:29:23 I should have described yesterday's crazy crandle mess. Besides that there were a bunch of herbs, there was a lot of oil. 

So the top of the candle was this seething, hot black mass creating a big flame and smoke. I kept thinking it'd calm down, and it just wouldn't.

9328 2018-06-24 17:28:01 InfoChip's #RFID products are ideal for industries like oil & gas, rigging, lifting, mining, aerospace, construction, & rental companies.
9329 2018-06-24 17:27:55 It’s time we look into bringing green technologies that create jobs and recycle plastic, rubber and other oil based products. The problem exists so let’s create answers to those problems. Shipping garbage to China isn’t an answer it is the problem.
9330 2018-06-24 17:27:45 I would try peppermint oil, but in small amounts. That stuff is strong!
9331 2018-06-24 17:27:44 They have granola bars on sale by the motor oil.

9334 2018-06-24 17:27:29 then you better go stop them poachers, normal fisherman, and every shark or carnivorous animal in the water cuz rn they’re fucking up ocean wildlife a lot more then so oil is
9335 2018-06-24 17:27:29 Well, at least you admit transport of oil by rail is dangerous. I trust you will demand that it be stopped.
9336 2018-06-24 17:27:24 Trying something new: a kaolin clay wash mixed with rosemary, safflower oil, ACV, and water infused with fenugreek, chamomile, garlic (), and lemon.

9339 2018-06-24 17:27:09 Dont like politics but I think this kid thing is more than an immigration thing. Yes they are fleeing to America but why are the fleeing? Mexico has corrupt government and police not to mention drug cartels that were like our old mob days.Time to clean Mexico I here they have oil
9340 2018-06-24 17:26:52 I think I found a trick on how to get rid of most of your soreness/DOMS: Take a serving of BCAA’s and a fish oil pill right before you go to bed
9341 2018-06-24 17:26:34 When traveling in Paris,France, be extra careful for the green salad dressing!  Many restaurants use nut oil!  Have them substitute for olive oil!  Kai had a minor reaction to the salads and discovered this although we let them know about treenut allergy!

9347 2018-06-24 17:25:56 Notice how Valerie Jarret is front and center with the semi fake smile. Wonder if she already had her bag packed to move in with Obama. The rest of them look like kids that just got a dose of castor oil.

9349 2018-06-24 17:25:53 The gases that are released with the oil are far more dangerous & harmful than any smoke or carbon monoxide.

9351 2018-06-24 17:25:46 Fish oil for health, and a hair skin and nails.

9354 2018-06-24 17:25:20 Aphids are numerous but weak. A strong blast with the hose can dislodge them and the ones that fall won't be able to climb up. Also dish soap spray damages their waxy protective coating and the sun will dehydrate them. Neem oil works too.
9355 2018-06-24 17:25:14 So their little pink hats were appropriate then

9360 2018-06-24 17:24:18 Deep-fried bacon sounds yummy! Can you place it in oil directly or do you have to batter-dip it or something?
9361 2018-06-24 17:24:04 We have suppressed energy technologies among the thousands of classified patents. Big oil wants them to never see the light of day. Many of the inventors of these technologies, such as the water powered car, died mysterious deaths.This suppression needs to end for the good of all

9364 2018-06-24 17:23:21 Question for @GDeLaurentiis and @FoodNetwork —is there ever a time I want to use olive oil other than extra virgin? If so, when? If not, why not?
9365 2018-06-24 17:23:12 Get some olive oil and pray over it. Then bless your house while spreading the oil around and praying over it.
9366 2018-06-24 17:23:01 Killing all of us in the process.

He’s profiting off the ppl filling his pockets & crickets 
9367 2018-06-24 17:23:01 If you're out of shaving cream, use olive oil. It works just as good, if not better.

9370 2018-06-24 17:22:44 I think as of right now @jaytechtv has officially deep fried his brain and ate it. It was just simmering in the oil for years and now he has fully fried it and has eaten it. Congrats on the 20+k subs on youtube btw.
9371 2018-06-24 17:22:38 I’m doing the same! Dabbing oil instead of smoking flower but gonna be slumped all the same.
9372 2018-06-24 17:22:29 It's like talking about the "forgotten americans". Ppl in Rust, Coal, Oil, Farm belt were never forgotten: lots of them did not put any effort 2 step off the mold & surpass their family working rut. The REAL "FORGOTTEN" Americans in era of trump r the 68.5 who DID NOT VOTE 4 HIM!

9378 2018-06-24 17:21:48 Cuticle oil will help so much!!! Or just keeping your nails hydrated in general
9379 2018-06-24 17:21:19 Wow- its rough. it’s really hard to read in one sitting...... like castor oil.
9380 2018-06-24 17:21:16 Feeling like a rotisserie chicken in the sun today with my coconut oil on !
9381 2018-06-24 17:20:36 Floating Island sure has a dreamy comforting scent of vanilla! What did you love most about this luxury bath oil? 
9382 2018-06-24 17:20:35 They produce high NOX & CO2 emmissions and oil produces emmissions as a product of engine lubrication. Splitting water requires more energy than is contained in the hydrogen produced. Hydrogen promotion is political, mainly to ensure engine market survival. Check your facts.
9383 2018-06-24 17:20:28 No we don't,we only got a Depot where we hire generator for private entities like  oil drilling activities in turkana

9389 2018-06-24 17:19:34 Thanks for the reply. It’s really a non statement though - in the war to reduce plastic packaging, Tesco has introduced more (just specifically talking about oil bottles here). I assume because it’s cheaper than using, and transporting, glass
9390 2018-06-24 17:19:32 Sarcasm doesn’t work for those who don’t get them. PS: All oil companies are not owned by the ‘royals’
9391 2018-06-24 17:19:32 vic you know that means that at MAX we can only take up 10% of the ocean with drilling, fish can go and adapt to other parts of the water just like every other animal can adapt, every one of those fish are gonna die regardless of oil or not, stop being soft

9398 2018-06-24 17:19:18 Love em actually, but my preference is to taste the potato (including skin). But if you prefer ingesting something that really only serves as a vehicle for hot oil, be my guest.

9404 2018-06-24 17:18:49 Global geo politics are changing, like it or not. The tyrant’s opened the door so let’s blow it wide open- CND has huge resources: oil, hydro, water, minerals gold, silver, nickel, copper, lead-zinc, iron, molybdenum, uranium, potash & diamonds +++ C’mon boys!
9405 2018-06-24 17:18:47 adbfnbdsbfhabfnaiiauf bc of olive oil?
9406 2018-06-24 17:18:43 I wouldn't believe so - because then we'd have to remove the deficit reduction due to the previous regime too or through the oil price cut, the deficits net of that also have gone up.

9412 2018-06-24 17:17:42 I realize that much of what he says is echoing the sentiment of others.  But he's still shoving his foot in his mouth to fill segments, regardless if it's his thoughts or not. He's terrible.

9414 2018-06-24 17:17:17 Most of ours are filled with overpriced foods, weird lotions made from hemp oil, and purveyors who haven't showered in a week.

9418 2018-06-24 17:16:34 Just found out the difference a new lawnmower blade makes. Year 5 on the $100 Murray mower. New plug, oil, air filter and blade. All changed by me. Not bad for a girl.

9435 2018-06-24 17:13:19 I wonder if the light is based on the type of usage or if its based on purely mileage?  I just looked at the book for the mini van, and thats suggesting an oil change at 13,000kms,  had I saved the money on all those oil changes, I could be driving something other than a minivan!

9448 2018-06-24 17:12:24 Wash your face!
If you don’t wash your face frequently it will cause oil and dirt to build up and clog ur pores which creates pimples!

9458 2018-06-24 17:11:27 After stealing some of my friend’s salad at the pub last night, sesame oil is my new favourite thing. I’ll be adding it to everything.

9461 2018-06-24 17:10:59 They ain't big in the cbd world anyway that's for sure. Cbd is mixed with an MCT oil for consumption and better absorption.
9462 2018-06-24 17:10:49 Mate, I don't know what's up with all these weirdos keep blocking me. 
Anyway , I'm off for food. 
Pimento stuffed olives, a selection of salami, feta cheese, sea salt and rosemary focaccia bread, hoummus and and toasted pittas and sun dried tomatoes in chilli oil.
9463 2018-06-24 17:10:49 Went to jiffy lube mf’s tried charging me almost $112 for an oil change and tire rotation... 

Go to a mom and pop shop down the street 

$60 for oil and tires... I love mom and pop shops bro give them business instead 

And I got free food! Was fucking good!

9468 2018-06-24 17:10:40 Couldn’t the fact that the price of oil is too low to be able to extract tar sands oil and make a profit have something (not all) to do with it?
9469 2018-06-24 17:10:29 Yes great race for you. You deserved better. For a short while I was affraid you overtaking max. I hope for Renault it wasn't the oil....

9476 2018-06-24 17:09:40 Great analogy. From Bush to Clinton truly is from the frying pan into the fire. Thank God their not in the White house. In essence, Trump pointed out their dynasties were fired in the minds of the American people.
9477 2018-06-24 17:09:39 Most of it is the decline in oil prices. People forget PCs were running $4B in the red with $100/Bl oil. 

So, imagine what that did to the deficit with $26/bl oil and even now at $58.

9491 2018-06-24 17:08:20 low dosages are the worst for side effects during W/D Most ppl try to stop the best they can between 300mg to 100mg. It’s “snake oil” right when you think gabapentin withdrawals should be getting easier it gets more difficult typically 900mg and lower

9512 2018-06-24 17:06:42 The oil itself isn’t the derivative, the CBD is. It seems to me, because we already have over the counter options available, the issue isn’t how the medicine is applied but arbitrarily keeping THC at any level away from patients. But, there’s a lot of advocacy for using both.
9513 2018-06-24 17:06:38 Hate to break it to you but over half of the country is NOT a “dying” breed.  There is so much smoke and mirrors from the snake oil salesman. Do your own research, vet your sources and think for yourself.
9514 2018-06-24 17:06:36 With data such as that from EEF which uses Hattie methods, teachers are being sold the illusion that there are simple research answers to improve their teaching, Do "this" and students will advance by x months. But EEF cannot replicate results on larger scales! It is snake oil!

9519 2018-06-24 17:05:48 They are thinking ONLY of themselves & their $$$. They will lie, cheat & steal, no matter the cost. The kids & elderly will get harm the most.

9554 2018-06-24 17:02:03 I would recommend curl cream and a few drops of hair oil.
9555 2018-06-24 17:01:51 There are many reasons Drumpf got here. Not his real popularity for sure! The ones who felt their voices were not heard I really feel for, but they fell for a snake oil salesman. 
Like in the wild West days. They didn't know any better. You and friends didn't, How??
9556 2018-06-24 17:01:46 Whoever said that baby oil takes off fake tan... fucking lair, I look like oily rat with a patchy tan

9558 2018-06-24 17:01:34 Progressives who are outraged by climate-change deniers: stop letting slide false health claims of alkaline water, crystals and other new-age buncombe. Science is evidence-based, not belief-based. You can’t decry climate deniers if you promote snake oil. #climatechange

9563 2018-06-24 17:01:09 I'm pretty sure couples CHOOSE to get married. So refusing services to same-sex weddings should be fine under her distinction right?
9564 2018-06-24 17:01:03 I want to oil you up
9565 2018-06-24 17:00:47 Try aloe and some organic pressed rose hip oil. Worked wonders
9566 2018-06-24 17:00:46 Hey @CarvelIceCream - my girlfriend has Celiac Disease and food allergies. What are the chances we can get a gluten free, canola oil free Fudgie the Whale? She’s never had one and I need to find a way to show her that there’s no cake quite like a Carvel cake!!
9567 2018-06-24 17:00:42 Anybody ever tried vitamin E oil for their skin? And if so, did it work for you? Pls let me know!!
9568 2018-06-24 17:00:32 My wasted a little bit of tea tree oil in my drawer, and now my whole house smells like it. Why is it so strong 
9569 2018-06-24 17:00:29 The term “canola oil” is short for “Canada Oil low acid,” a name coined to avoid the less marketable word for the product, “rapeseed oil”! #facts

9579 2018-06-24 16:59:16 One time I got the prices backwards for rose absolute and rose essential oil on air (the essential oil is more expensive), so some mistakes are easily made.
9580 2018-06-24 16:59:05 dream: helping drill oil wells in germany by sitting in a car with kids in the back and drilling holes in oranges to mix with vodka
9581 2018-06-24 16:58:49 I love that exfoliator and toner idea ! I think coconut oil actually clogs my pores so I use oatmeal for cleansing which is amazing for clearing acne and almond oil as a moisturizer
9582 2018-06-24 16:58:49 Also, forgot to mention it yesterday but fantastic to see the Oil Kings Trey Fix-Wolansky drafted by the Blue Jackets.  Outstanding offensive talent, great attitude and a great person.  Would have been a top 60 pick last year if he was 6’1 rather than 5’6.
9583 2018-06-24 16:58:47 So you think that OPEC isn’t having an effect in the rest of the world? Or that Iran isn’t having an effect in the US? Iran is a huge oil producer
9584 2018-06-24 16:58:44 And we don't care please deal with the child humanitarian crisis instead of worrying about oil money. 

Thanks.
9585 2018-06-24 16:58:32 I remember the oil crisis in the late 70's, I joined a queue at a petrol station during my driving test. I was also working hard at weekends to pay for flying lessons, they doubled in price within about a year and I had to give up #badtimes
9586 2018-06-24 16:58:27 I saw enough of these snake oil merchants to last me a lifetime. It's one of the reasons I took early retirement.
9587 2018-06-24 16:58:18 Yeah, have been using lots of oil on them after discovering the damage. My nails just look weird without their usual burgundy shade on them
9588 2018-06-24 16:58:16 Either these were unfair and over the top regulations or Trump is pro oil spilling into the ocean. It is obvious and so is your hatred untrustworthy propaganda. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder

9591 2018-06-24 16:57:55 Forte oil sir,  working with you..so as to had and gain experience to the engineering sector
9592 2018-06-24 16:57:53 Am glad you mentioned it @BalakrishnanR. The oil crisis of 1973-74 and the subsequent collapse of the Breton Woods arrangement led to a long inflationary cycle which was slated by central banks only in the 1980s.

9615 2018-06-24 16:53:27 It doesn’t have to be Lagos bro. Oil producing states will have land double that price .

9617 2018-06-24 16:53:15 I get that for sure, but those are things we can control. There are plastics created without use of oil (see Newlight Tech), for example, which can help us continue to aim for greener impact. 

I just think we need to aggressively pursue change, and to lead it as Canadians.
9618 2018-06-24 16:52:42 Melt into Moisture & Deep Sea Repair treatments are my favorite. I removed my braids and my hair was so dry and brittle and I had more hair loss than usual so I mixed those two together and added some agave oil. My curls feels so moisturized, shiny & brand new 
9619 2018-06-24 16:52:30 But that’s just an example. It will be worth more in oil producing states
9620 2018-06-24 16:52:27 oil boom....been in 2, have fun.

9622 2018-06-24 16:52:15 @cartalk 2005 BMW 325i w/ M56 engine 40k miles. Oil mixing w coolant. Leak down test: all cylinders 15, except 5 and 4 those were 22 and 20 respectfully. Exhaust gas through radiator test negative. Where is this mixing occurring?
9623 2018-06-24 16:52:13 This is great news. Goes a long way in guaranteeing our independence from oil producers who supply terrorists and, in some cases, wish to see our downfall.
9624 2018-06-24 16:52:04 Imagine if I were a mom & I only tweeted about how much I loved certain cleaning products.

9625 2018-06-24 16:51:48 Just to give full credit, tho, the #GOP does give f&ck all about the oceans, or oil spills, so their agenda and 45's marry up perfectly...again....

9628 2018-06-24 16:51:37 Actually,  the origin does matter.
Canada has much higher standards and regulations conserning oil and gas pipelines. 
The engo's use American incedents all the time in an attempt to validate their "could "happen here.

9631 2018-06-24 16:51:22 No we remembered the oil disaster even trump and his minions do, except they hate good more then evil.

9634 2018-06-24 16:51:15 My dad told me to take the car to work but said to hold up so he can check the oil , so he said to pop the hood open and my dumbass popped the trunk open & he looked at me like bitch you fr rn , get tf out the car lmao I didn’t mean to his mean ass just puts me nervous lmao

9643 2018-06-24 16:50:10 Oil prices are not decided by tweets.

Sanctions were pushed by Congress, the Trump administration is dragging their feet. 

The US has never been this weak for a lifetime. It's a free fall. 

Russia is quite comfortable in Syria, Trump flip-flopping does not harm them at all.
9644 2018-06-24 16:50:07 【ad】Few things are as versatile as our oil. "Oilmighty" can use for cooking, gear and even lubricant for your relationship!
9645 2018-06-24 16:49:54 @realDonaldTrump 
Dear Trumpers,
Trump created a horrible humanitarian crisis at the border to distract us from the next phase of conspiring with Russia. He’s sending 6 Repub. senators (plan election hack), Perry (oil deal), & Bolton (Putin mtg) this week. You want AmerRussia?
9646 2018-06-24 16:49:53 Oil and the ocean, what could go wrong?
9647 2018-06-24 16:49:46 Canada has no gold reserves, Liberal gov't is throttling development of oil & gas sector, a possible NAFTA failure would hit manufacturers, carbon tax will make business uncompetitive with trading partners. Trudeau gov't is destroying the underpinnings of entire Canadian economy.
9648 2018-06-24 16:49:44 Atoh
9649 2018-06-24 16:49:43 Continuing your thought.  Canadian companies have limited ability to sell Canadian oil to Quebec consumers due to lack of pipelines from the West to the East.  Quebec politicians block pipelines.  You vote for these politicians.  You have an indirect choice.  You choose OPEC.
9650 2018-06-24 16:49:34 Big oil corruption candidates. Giving the people's resources away. I doubt things will ever change.
9651 2018-06-24 16:49:23 I did wish #ANGS a happy weekend! 
9652 2018-06-24 16:49:15 Might have something to do with the oil and gas drilling and fracking.

9655 2018-06-24 16:49:02 Indeed but Venezuela's is an oil rich country and the dictator in command is not exploting the resources. Central America is a mega agriculture country but is putting all efforts in a marijuana and cocaine production. You  can lead a horse to water but you can't making drink!
9656 2018-06-24 16:48:56 coconut oil fixes everything and that’s a fact
9657 2018-06-24 16:48:52 The Saudis dishonour all Muslims with their vicious #Whabbhi extremism. In 1840s the Caliph destroyed the original Whabbist heresy but now they have all that oil money -and Trump on their side while they collaborate with Israel.
9658 2018-06-24 16:48:50 Correct, however perhaps the dollar can maintain its status as the worlds reserve currency because oil produced the the OPEC nations is only priced in dollars. I think me and you are on the same team!

So please re-do the economics of water, because it is nowhere near valued enough.

9836 2018-06-24 16:25:00 I like oil ... it is used for tons of modern conveniences like gas 
I remember reading in the late 80s early 90s how they found fossil fuel (oil) wasn’t from the “dinosaurs” and it was actually a renewable resource, of course it seems to have not made the transition to online

9838 2018-06-24 16:24:51 also to call america a democracy by now is a joke because our government is just getting rich people richer, so in turn making our economy/capitalism a joke. we have all these cleaner resources we refuse to use because oil/non-green resources make us more money :// 2/2
9839 2018-06-24 16:24:44 Well we know about his foundation in New York. Another Trump scam, he's just a cheap snake oil salesman. And his followers are just his chumps. You almost have to feel sorry for them.

9849 2018-06-24 16:23:55 If there’s one man who has had the interests of the left at heart throughout his career, it’s the ex senior economist for Royal Dutch Shell oil company who agreed not to challenge the Tories in public in exchange for a carrier bag tax and a ministerial car.

9856 2018-06-24 16:22:39 Nah, this one isn't about Obama. It's the purest of Republican policy decisions: do anything possible to enable oil companies to make money and damn the environment! The vast majority of R policies involve corporate welfare and making more money for the 1%. Follow the money.
9857 2018-06-24 16:22:36 He's head of the oil spill recover institute, overseeing research on the effects of the spill and also looks at detection innovations. Up here, with pipes under/near ice and snow and now looking at offshore rigs, detecting a spill early is crucial.
9858 2018-06-24 16:22:23 Hydrogenated fats provide a textural quality to food that will have to be duplicated, likely with saturated fats (e.g., palm oil). Scientists might want to temper their enthusiasm...
9859 2018-06-24 16:22:13 Your pastor has 10 bodyguards yet he's giving you anointing oil for protection. The thunder that will strike you is doing drill in a millitary camp
9860 2018-06-24 16:22:04 Should be interesting since 230,000 gallons of oil just spilled in Alberta. Wasn't that exactly what BC was concerned about???
9861 2018-06-24 16:21:55 And economic activity drives demand and domestic shale production has eliminated our need for foreign oil so I think the Iranian issue doesn't move the pump price more than 5 cents in either direction
9862 2018-06-24 16:21:11 Kim Jong Un has developed a better relationship with President XI of China and Russia is now talking of building an oil pipeline through North and South Korea.  America opens the door and other countries rush in and grab up the opportunities. Arm Chair Reporter.

9880 2018-06-24 16:18:40 Oil prices are increasing because Trump pulled US out of Iran deal. But because deal remains in place in Europe and rest of the world their energy costs remain stable. Trump has disadvantaged US

9883 2018-06-24 16:18:26 As for those interests intended to enhance the joy of living, these are total strangers. One cannot enjoy the sunset when he must worry about the oil to light the lamp when the darkness closes in.

9885 2018-06-24 16:18:21 This is somewhat fun to watch. Like our crooked ex-president jailed by prosecutors enabled by a bill he signed into law. Or an Oil workers Union crying out loud its fight to lower fuel prices. But not by lowering taxes. They want Petrobras to foot the price cut by itself.

9893 2018-06-24 16:16:53 We are giving away our crude oil ( 1 million barrels a day ) to American oil companies for around $8 a barrel ( world price around $70 ) to keep their war and hate economies running. This is theft protected by the most powerful military on earth.
9894 2018-06-24 16:16:53 They are HYPOCRITES! The traitors T.Y Danjuma & his kinsmen who murdered Gen Aguyi Ironsi; led the British masterminded genocide on BIAFRA that claimed about  6 million lives. Danjuma did that to share oil wells in BIAFRALAND with the British. He did not remember Christianity!

9899 2018-06-24 16:15:55 Right, but her question was about why we have a need to extract it. Lots of kids need the oil to prevent seizures, not necessarily the entirety of the substance.

9910 2018-06-24 16:14:49 That's what they're all doing for their golden parachute, after golden goose in WH directs tax $$ to business interests like oil, gas, big pharm, or a media job like Santorum

9932 2018-06-24 16:11:19 I always find it strange when someone says "well the veterans don't get the thing but the [whatever] does"

Y'all we can do both. Our federal government creates money from regulation, we could end the oil wars, OR simply go do the goddamm things

It's about priority and empathy
9933 2018-06-24 16:11:16 Maybe everyday life wouldn't be a perpetual shitshow if we didn't inject politics into every aspect of life possible. You can't go to a sporting event, have dinner after, and catch a tv show before bed without some agitprop the whole way.

9941 2018-06-24 16:10:11 sad that so many publications abandon any journalistic integrity when talking about Tesla ... they must be getting paid by oil and gas or legacy car makers to spread rumors or they are just stupid and believe the "short" lies with no fact checking

9945 2018-06-24 16:09:55 It is very important IMHO to take it easy the 1st 500 miles or so and vary your speed (don't use cruise control) so that the rings seat properly.  I have seen some that just drove it like they stole it immediately and had oil consumption issues.  Mine has been awesome.

9956 2018-06-24 16:08:41 "oil and gas don’t really get any" that is an opinion statement, which is debunked by mutually agreed on facts, that any and all tax credits and deductions are "real subsidies", regardless of what entity is taking them for what purpose. Otherwise, it is double standard.
9957 2018-06-24 16:08:35 6 of your top 7 are just different ways to drop a potato in hot oil. Baked should go to the top
9958 2018-06-24 16:08:25 Oil companies do not own there service infrastructure or there refueling infrastructure - Tesla does! And why does this loser not have a Twitter account? Maybe because he likes to make comments about Tesla during a quiet period & not have to answer to his obvious short attack.

9965 2018-06-24 16:07:13 Simple cleansing oil
Hado Labo cleansing oil

9966 2018-06-24 16:07:10 Yup!  He looks like the kind of person that will drown in a bucket of oil just to satisfy his gluttony.

Hair oil lucido-l ini bagus bangettttttt lbh bagus dari elips
9968 2018-06-24 16:06:55 i've been dealing with the issue since genesis, bc my controller was stolen and they gave me a spare one to keep; I just blow on it every now and again, and I use a little bit of olive oil to keep the stick moving. It also tends to be more prevalent on unwired.

9970 2018-06-24 16:06:41 This. People have no idea.
9971 2018-06-24 16:06:25 Oi @sainsburys what’s going off?? The wholesale cost of crude oil has reduced significantly over the last month or so, yet you still haven’t passed the savings on to the consumer! Totally unacceptable the way you’re treating drivers in Nottingham! SORT IT OUT!!
9972 2018-06-24 16:06:22 Bought a skin product without checking ingredients. This product has lavender oil in it but I still decided to use it, now my face is itchy af. #weirdallergies
9973 2018-06-24 16:06:17 Definitely would like medicinal cannabis. Cannot pay £65 a month for CBD oil. Would making it legal mean more people off their trolley driving?
9974 2018-06-24 16:06:17 The U.S. oil and gas industry emits 13 million metric tons of methane from its operations each year and most Americans don't give a f^%k. Methane is a highly potent greenhouse gas, with over 80 times the warming impact of carbon dioxide.
9975 2018-06-24 16:06:11 If you ever think, "I haven't used oil paints in a bit, I should do a warm up study" and your brain says, "Right, right, how about a box made of dozens of abalone shells?"

You just go on ahead and tell that brain to fuck right off.
9976 2018-06-24 16:06:04 @realDonaldTrump just repealed an order that directly involves our Oceans that border the US and the Great Lakes. The order restricts a number of zones where offshore/onshore drilling is aloud. Our president is allowing us to drill more oil frequently from our water ways.
9977 2018-06-24 16:05:55 Politely, and comfortably, of course.
9978 2018-06-24 16:05:51 @realDonaldTrump has diverted our attention with his horrific policy at the border. Meanwhile, he is sending 6 Repub. Senators, Perry, Bolton to the Kremlin this week, supposedly to discuss trade & cyber security. Oil deal? Planning next hack? Where is Dem outrage? Media?

9980 2018-06-24 16:05:47 There is no proof of the Fox Fairytale News propaganda. Exxon gave a huge chunk of their Gulf of Mexico mineral rights in exchange for a Russian oil field.
9981 2018-06-24 16:05:29 Leave me the fuck alone with you essential oil party. The very fact that you have time to throw a party for essential oils is sick.
9982 2018-06-24 16:05:09 Dunno how ur skin will react (mine is dry & loves thayers) but I've found tea tree oil to work better than drying chemicals (encouraging skin to produce MORE oil). I mix w vitamin e oil as a spot treatment & mix it into face masks. But keep it away from pets!!
9983 2018-06-24 16:04:54 While allowing oil & gas companies to drill in places like this, both health & history are destroyed. Nazis behaved in the same way. No doubt the black market for artifacts will soar, even as more are destroyed & homes for those under 1% will be utterly destroyed. #MonumentsMen

nunca dejan de sorprenderme con su contenido de tv rural. Pinche desperdicio de dinero invertido en esa mamada
9985 2018-06-24 16:04:49 Idk if this applies to you or not but I had my gallbladder out a while ago which means I'm somewhat intolerant to oily/greasy/fried things, and I found out a lot of movie popcorn is made with coconut oil, which can be super irritating to some people. 
9986 2018-06-24 16:04:40 Same!!
9987 2018-06-24 16:04:34 I watched one game i was strangely invested in while i waited for my moms car to get its oil change
9988 2018-06-24 16:04:25 Castrol Motor Oil - It's more than just oil, it's liquid engineering.

9992 2018-06-24 16:03:58 Disgraceful.  Disgusting and vile. Very ugly on the inside and out. He needs more oil in his hair.
9993 2018-06-24 16:03:53 Just went though it. Take care of yourself do what makes you happy. Drink some tea,relax or of you can get some CBD oil thats a life saver when I can't get my meds.
9994 2018-06-24 16:03:40 Feel like  anybody with the name Otis works on cars and will request a 6 pack and plate of beans just to give you an oil change
9995 2018-06-24 16:03:23 You mean the border line drawn in accordance with International Law not the SNP line drawn to claim the most oil revenue 
9996 2018-06-24 16:03:22 And never face-to-face, even at that.
9997 2018-06-24 16:03:22 面白すぎる
9998 2018-06-24 16:03:11 He was invaded for the oil so he did a good thing
9999 2018-06-24 16:03:08 If you wear gold chains to the gym there’s a 90% chance you drive a 1999 Honda Civic and you probably need an oil change
10000 2018-06-24 16:03:04 A friend of mine got that one too and said it was great! I got the jason and the argan oil one and it smells so good. I actually ordered this online because I don't live close enough to a store now either, and they shipped it in cardboard with biodegradable packing peanuts
10001 2018-06-24 16:02:53 Had a guy bitching about the price of gas other day until I pointed out he just paid $2.50 for a bottle of water.
10002 2018-06-24 16:02:29 There are pipes from Alberta into Quebec for both oil and gas. If oil becomes expensive enough,Quebec will ruin their environment to extract it. But it wouldn’t make economic sense at current prices (and there isn much to extract). Better to concentre on electricity & agriculture
10003 2018-06-24 16:02:27 Give it time to work itself out. Playing tit for tat right now. Oil has already started changing.
10004 2018-06-24 16:02:27 ง่า อย่ากดดันตัวเองเลยนะคะ เขียนแบบที่อยากเลยค่ะ จะคอยเป็นฟีลแบ็คให้เสมอนะคะ อิอิ /ยังรอคอยอย่างคาดหวังว่าลูฟี่จะต้องมีความโฉดขึ้นอยู่เลยค่ะ แบบตอนนี้ยังถือว่ายังเด็กเมื่อเทียบกับกัปตันคนอื่นๆอยู่เลยนะคะ ถ้าอายุเท่าหมอแล้วเราว่าฟี่อาจจะกลายเป็นผัวที่หล่อได้แน่นอนค่ะ ฟฟฟฟฟฟ
10005 2018-06-24 16:02:19 The Shale Revolution happened, and USA went from being out biggest customer to being our biggest competitor. AB needs to face that reality and adapt.

Oil is a mug's game, with tough low margin competition.  It's a bad bet.

Ontario learned that in the 1860s.

10010 2018-06-24 16:01:31 I am already getting multiple junk mails offering me Cannabis Oil without prescription. Seriously is that what those spammers think I need out of everything that is missing in my life? Cannabis Oil?
10011 2018-06-24 16:01:28 Another thing - why does it matter the origin of the oil involved in this spill?  Does it change the severity of the incident?  The media gets stuck on all the wrong things.
10012 2018-06-24 16:01:21 We are somewhat weak on oil use. For example we follow US CAFE standards for automobiles which allows too many inefficient vehicles to be sold. Eg: my 6 cylinder Subaru Outback, and all those four door pickups used to go to the mall not as work vehicles.
10013 2018-06-24 16:01:18 何回見ても笑える
10014 2018-06-24 16:01:03 Actually one of the criteria of equalization (along with personal tax revenue and business tax revenue) is natural resource revenue. So price of oil is significant.
10015 2018-06-24 16:00:47 Things i do just to be able to show you this body oil .Ive baked in the sun and now  have two white eye circles

10026 2018-06-24 15:59:37 It’s a huge process. He makes the enhanced oil/butter from scratch & then uses it to bake with.
10027 2018-06-24 15:59:30 Most men with low testosterone consume too much junk food and too many carbohydrates. Adding healthy fats, such as avocados, olive oil or almonds, will increase testosterone naturally! #SundayMorning #workhardplayhard #MintFitness
10028 2018-06-24 15:59:29 also on top of using black soap and activated charcoal i started using some tea tree oil before i put on moisturizer and holy fuck my skin is so clear and it also clears up any break outs so fast
10029 2018-06-24 15:59:21 He wasn't involved in the paperwork allowing BDB to pass towards the oil crescent? I can't remember the name of the official implicated in that document.
10030 2018-06-24 15:59:19 I do a sugar and olive oil scrub and it has made a HUGE impact. I do it like every four or five days
