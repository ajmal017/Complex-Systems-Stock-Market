Sorry kids but the economy has been pumped and dumped like they do penny stocks all the time. They sold at peak and bought back at the bottom. Classic move however we all suffer.

13 2018-02-07 23:54:22 I think the problem is that stocks and bonds are also widely viewed as bubbles.

It's likely those selling stocks are already more risk adverse than crypto investors, so substituting one bubble (stocks and bonds) for a riskier one (crypto) doesn't make much sense.

46 2018-02-07 23:44:00 I never set foot in Wetherspoons you sarcastic berk. But I did work 11 years on trawlers. You want to be part of an organisation that thinks shoving dead fish out through the scuppers preserves stocks and improves the oceans feel free. You're made for each other.

48 2018-02-07 23:42:12 It’s not the asset itself we find interesting as much as the behavioral side of it. Its stocks on steroids
49 2018-02-07 23:41:50 Funny thing is I answered you and you're circumventing everything. You honestly cannot show one train of thought and it's tiresome. You jump from profit to company to laborers to stocks. How about address what I said? We already talked about generating profit but make your point.
50 2018-02-07 23:41:21 Dearest Charles, Just want you to know that whenever I see you, you are a voice I believe and you bring me comfort! When the stocks dropped last week, it was your presence that meant the most to me personally! Guess you have a fan. Smiles!
51 2018-02-07 23:40:57 Stocks took a big hit this week.
52 2018-02-07 23:39:59 S & P futures are cheaper right now than when Tepper said stocks were cheap  :)

55 2018-02-07 23:38:26 It amazes me when people quote the stock market as a measure of economic health when 84% of stocks are owned by the top 10%. The stock market, like those 10%, are working directly against you. The stock market has been breaking records for years now. Has your life been improving?

58 2018-02-07 23:37:10 Noticed that as well! He hates to pic individual stocks but seems to always mention $Hiku
59 2018-02-07 23:37:05 It's fair to say bitcoin is risky. So if stocks take a downturn and investors look to de-risk, they might de-risk here at the same time (ie get out). My hope had been that a stock crash would see  some of that money flow to crypto. Now not so sure.
60 2018-02-07 23:36:47 So you’re mad at stocks now Donnie?
61 2018-02-07 23:35:51 Forbes, Jan 2028: “Sully says ‘on-perm hardware is the way forward’, stocks in dying server vendors surge”. Elsewhere, I short Dell and Cisco
62 2018-02-07 23:35:31 Being a server is crazy cause u overhear teenagers talking about stocks and middle aged businessmen talking about boobs
63 2018-02-07 23:35:29 Stocks climb a wall of worry.
64 2018-02-07 23:34:25 Yeah...everyone just wants the uncertainty to calm down so stocks can stabilize and so they can sleep at night. The whole month of FEB will probably be volatile as the markets price in quick rising rates and the possibility of inflation.
65 2018-02-07 23:34:01 Buy now! Stocks are on sale!!!
66 2018-02-07 23:33:41 Yep, always backing up with DD.. I buy stocks with great products..
67 2018-02-07 23:33:24 10 years from now when I have a blue tick stocks will live and die by whether or not a product or service gets the “way forward” stamp of approval.
68 2018-02-07 23:33:20 yea no shit. When i said its i mean the company, not invention. We obviously know enough to realize what I meant without nitpicking. Well, sadly for you, that's how some people become millionaires. Many great companies have started out as penny stocks.
69 2018-02-07 23:31:20 I think the style he wants to play may not do well in the MU. But Gardevoir has low damage without 2 or 3 stored power stocks, unless she has the wall. So the mixups don't have to be unfavorable of you take them and force pressure on her. It's definitely an interesting chart.

72 2018-02-07 23:30:16 Perhaps, after you are done forcing people to applaud you, and to attend your yuge parade, you can make it mandatory for people to buy stocks!
73 2018-02-07 23:29:54 They need much higher to compete with stocks IMO
74 2018-02-07 23:29:45 I worked for brokerage arm of huge bank...they NEVER verified income prior to 2007-08 slide.Had clients told by real estate agent to lie to get larger home.I told them they could not afford it-would lose stocks if defaulted. 2 clients did it anyway and lost home to foreclosure.
75 2018-02-07 23:29:24 Stocks are just leveling out no need to panick
76 2018-02-07 23:29:14 Sure. Hasn't the country composition of our immigration inflows (not stocks!!) shifted substantially in the last decade?
77 2018-02-07 23:29:08 To all of the chart players $SNAP is an example of why chats sometimes dont matter. Many have the rule including @RedDogT3 not to touch stocks under the 200 day but a great earnings release trumps a chart every single time as the stock gapped above the 200 day and kept going
78 2018-02-07 23:28:55 @CriminaalLawyer @MoneyGame101 I only had a few stocks to basically track it, so do I just lose those?
79 2018-02-07 23:28:13 Stocks go up and down. We know that they wouldn't stay up forever, they'd eventually drop. The economy is still strong thanks to the POTUS. Keep fighting ahead. Drown out the noise. The noise is already eating it own. It's fun just to sit back and watchm
80 2018-02-07 23:25:44 Stocks.
81 2018-02-07 23:25:03 @EddyCast09, every time I look at my stocks and see your shutter pump on $AMLH, I laugh. You and your stocks are complete shit! And not to mention..... look at $AZFL! 
82 2018-02-07 23:24:42 The company. Look, if you make an invention and people buy its stocks, you're going to have way, way, way work and deserve the credit than if I were to be a cashier. I think you need to look into how hard it's to start and run a company on a new idea and I think you'll understand
83 2018-02-07 23:23:37 My bet is we get rising rates that trigger a modest risk-off episode, & then a sudden realization that if the Fed doesn't cap rates a la BOJ, the US govt will soon be at risk of nominally defaulting either internally or externally.  Only liquid way to "flee USD" = buy US stocks

91 2018-02-07 23:19:37 So are stocks
92 2018-02-07 23:19:26 But isn’t the same concept true to most CC purchases? Most things you buy (let’s just say a car), immediately depreciate in value. So you’re paying interest on a depreciating asset nonetheless. At least cryptos, metals, stocks...etc have appreciation upside.

110 2018-02-07 23:11:41 It's not not managing your money. Even if you follow the stocks there is nothing you can do about it. Why can you not understand that the average person doesn't care about stock markets. Most people are more worried about just keeping the lights on.

131 2018-02-07 22:59:57 I just said US smallcaps and REITs were cheap in 2000. It's hard to say smallcaps and REITs are as cheap now as they were in 2000. Same for EM stocks. "Value" might be as cheap, but I don't know how much it will help. Russell 1000 Val. did 6.96% from 2000 thru 2017.

139 2018-02-07 22:57:28 Markets are completely incomprehensible day to day, but make complete sense over long time periods. The only way to invest in stocks sensibly is to have a very long term perspective like 15 years and much more

141 2018-02-07 22:54:42 Yea...for those who produce, sell and hold stocks in anti-anxiety meds.
142 2018-02-07 22:54:42 league crypto when?
it could be like stocks in riot games
143 2018-02-07 22:53:31 Why not? Every person with a phone or computer can trade crypto no gatekeepers like in stocks ie Schwaab, Meryl Lynch, etc
144 2018-02-07 22:53:20 Interest rate made new high, crushes stocks.
145 2018-02-07 22:52:56 Snapchat stocks about to plummet into the dirt!
146 2018-02-07 22:52:05 Not to mention, rich people let money make money. So even if you think they're sitting on their asses, they worked hard to get to where they are now and they have great teams that let them pick good stocks, mutual funds, bonds, gold, etc to invest their money. Hence working less.
147 2018-02-07 22:51:32 When interest rates (bonds) go up, stocks go down. Companies having to pay more interest on debt (bonds) = less earning power.  I thought you were a smart and stable genius that's great at business?
148 2018-02-07 22:51:23 Basically; trade is this; BUY BUY BUY stocks till Gold hits $35.  Silver hits.  penny bid.  the biggest trading places movie is currently in production with asgard, star wars, earth kings; mars queen, mars son of Mars king.

150 2018-02-07 22:50:18 Hopefully the crab stocks can keep up with the demand. As I recall the price of cod was also high just before the moratorium. And we all know how that turned out.
151 2018-02-07 22:50:18 $TSLA Up 8 points now. 370 Feb 17 calls at open. :) High short interest stocks are great to buy because of the big potential spike. This could be tomorrow's 1 tweet trade. Need to see analyst notes in the PM for confirmation

156 2018-02-07 22:48:36 Let's review then..
Stocks are equity - u r correct.
#TaxReformandJobsAct hit
More equity in stocks increasing wealth for both public & private pensions, Institutional & private investors
Increasing bonuses
increased jobs
increased wages 
But you don't like it cause ur an asshole
157 2018-02-07 22:48:09 Makes sense. What can this tell us about the unobserved skill shift in U.S. immigrant inflows (not stocks!) over the last decade?
158 2018-02-07 22:47:28 Are you talking about taxes and capital gains that light coin is a type of security or acid and therefore gets taxed like stocks?
159 2018-02-07 22:47:27 Despite the bounce back yesterday, the lack of follow through today means we have a little more back and forth and maybe even a test of Monday’s lows before moving higher. #stocks #StockMarket
160 2018-02-07 22:46:56 What would be funny about short disclosures? We would find out what tiny positions Chanos has in all the stocks he talks down. $TSLA
161 2018-02-07 22:45:55 @chriskatje Hi! Nice to meet you, My name is Erick Ramírez and I'm a mexican reporter. Can I send you an email with a query for an article about companies stocks during St Valentines that i'm working in? Regards!
162 2018-02-07 22:45:53 Yeah my stocks took quite a dump. Or should I say quite a Trump. #IjusttookaTrump
163 2018-02-07 22:44:52 it was manipulated and will go up and down for a few days.Only people who under stand the dow and stocks knows this we see you have people who don't under stand how it works

165 2018-02-07 22:44:22 I enjoyed reading about the variety of inks and substrates used in flexography. To me, that is one of the aspects that makes this subject so unique. From face stocks to adhesives, the options are truly endless. Thanks for sharing, Bethany! @ClemsonGC #gcflexo

169 2018-02-07 22:42:40 Dear @Snapchat DO YOU WANT YOUR STOCKS TO GO DOWN? BECAUSE THAT UPDATE IS HOW YOU MAKE YOUR STOCKS TO GO DOWN!
170 2018-02-07 22:41:55 Counter I guess is that growth should have a higher duration than div payers, thus making those stocks more rate sensitive
171 2018-02-07 22:41:46 Illegally. 
172 2018-02-07 22:41:08 Still would've been worth it, i had 2 stocks.
173 2018-02-07 22:39:32 Fine stocks on both sides, he is a joke!!
174 2018-02-07 22:39:15 OMG stop talking Bitcoin already!! Stick to stocks!!
175 2018-02-07 22:38:06 Im just saying the company is lower than it has been, if you wanna gauge based off of stocks fine xD i just gauge off of how many people care about the product that i know, and that number has dwindled dramatically over the years
176 2018-02-07 22:38:03 When Gold hits $35 then Sell stocks...not a $ too soon!  Okay turtles!!! We got them stuck now.  Both bets paid out.  Please wait for next month options
177 2018-02-07 22:37:53 Value is just as cheap, int’l and EM stocks even cheaper.  And S&P valuations well below 1999.  Your negativity narrative has more holes than Swiss cheese, much like your S&P 500-only examples of the past
178 2018-02-07 22:37:50 Stocks close lower reversing early gains as S&P finds resistance at the upper 50ema.
179 2018-02-07 22:37:50 المشكله في اسواقنا حتى قفزة القط المحتضر مو محصلينها
180 2018-02-07 22:37:27 True, but even still #bitcoin is more trustworthy to them than stocks
181 2018-02-07 22:37:24 I’m currently sitting on 50% cash in my portfolio. Was tempted to chase a couple stocks I’m watching today, but decided to keep waiting for my planned entry point. My first time trying this strategy. We’ll see how tomorrow goes
182 2018-02-07 22:37:04 Why is gold not going up? Reason is that people are buying into just how great things are,, . When stocks take another nose dive and they will very soon,, Gold will get some nice love,, to 1400. Book it,
183 2018-02-07 22:36:49 hey buddy @radioleary seen ur fragrance on @thismorning  2day..who stocks it pal? #IrishFan
184 2018-02-07 22:36:11 You must have been sick to your stomach when stocks bounced back today?
185 2018-02-07 22:35:54 Exactly, and a story about a local murder or missing persons will also generally not make stocks go down, unless that person is affiliated with a well-known company. And it may even bump up stocks for security systems and weapons if people are feeling unsafe.
186 2018-02-07 22:35:47 So do I. Or in the stocks, where people can throw food at him, the cheaper day-old food or the kind carefully selected from dumpsters by people funding his tax break.
187 2018-02-07 22:35:23 Omg, I would die if ASDA stocks BTS albums because my family does their weekly shopping there. PLEASE LET IT HAPPEN. I HAVE BEEN WANTING THIS FROM DAY ONE. 

@BTS_twt #BestFanArmy #BTSARMY #iHeartAwards
188 2018-02-07 22:35:23 I understand it I just don't play stocks at all
189 2018-02-07 22:34:54 @nicoledarrah So how many Americans are going to die waiting for a liver transplant while the illegal alien gets one on us?
190 2018-02-07 22:34:54 ههههههههه
191 2018-02-07 22:34:44 I was referring to the charts which reflects US stocks , bonds. US stocks went parabolic and correction was overdue. And yes, European Futures fell in avg -10% vs US avg -12%, I assume algos driving EU futures more to the downside in hi correlation than upside moves
192 2018-02-07 22:34:02 They had the chance. For years. They didn't care about it then, why should we care about them now? Send them back. Let them be a "benefit" to their own country.

199 2018-02-07 22:32:17 If we take the meaning that the states are afraid of a strong central power your argument for gun control doesn’t make sense. The military and police are constantly getting more militarized therefore as citizens it makes sense we are putting bump stocks on your guns
200 2018-02-07 22:31:10 Got some corporate private prison stocks to sell ya...
201 2018-02-07 22:30:46 Does divestment from oil company stocks lower future demand for their stock, and does it ultimately create a situation where oil company insiders (and like minded individuals) end up trading with themselves?
202 2018-02-07 22:30:08 @AskRobinhood my account that I've had for months is now under review again. I've had stocks and signed up for many things. Suddenly it's  locked everything. I'm being ignored and you guys got rid of customer service and please help.
203 2018-02-07 22:30:07 This after hours craziness is pure ETF trading. Noting to do with actual stocks.
204 2018-02-07 22:28:39 Do you think the whole short vol blowup is over? I could see a cycle of yields higher, stocks panic, bonds panic, stocks retrace over and over until yields are a little higher and stocks are a little lower
205 2018-02-07 22:28:32 The US stock  market is half the world's market cap. It's worth thinking about how much you want in it. To get 9.2% out of stocks since 2000, you had to have an allocation far away from US stocks -- in other words an allocation that wasn't exactly passive.
206 2018-02-07 22:28:10 The metals soooo precious; get FUCKED into hell!  We mean sell off in GOLd and silver will not escape; sell silver sell gold buy stocks!!!
207 2018-02-07 22:27:57 @ByronBernstein  Thoughts about investing 1000 X MOMO Stocks?

209 2018-02-07 22:27:37 Increased $GOOG to 6% of single stocks.
210 2018-02-07 22:27:28 So disgaceful that a person legally in our country killed 50 people in Las Vegas. This is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the GOP to get tough on bump stocks, and with the NRA, FAST!
211 2018-02-07 22:27:21 My 401k is loaded with stocks. I hope those greedy CEOs drive prices to the moon!
212 2018-02-07 22:27:15 'We're gonna pick the best stocks', then it was 'we're gonna pick the best fund mangers', & now it's 'we're gonna pick the best ETFs'. This is a game an adviser should prevent clients from doing. It's a game they should not participate in themselves. @michaelbatnick @RobinJPowell
213 2018-02-07 22:27:06 Sounds interesting to the tech world, stocks, investors, etc. Sounds like a nightmare for gamers. We can barely stream videos without interference, and not everyone is in a place with the best WiFi. Too much downside. I remember when @amazon was gonna deliver packages by drone..

220 2018-02-07 22:24:37 Sell silvers as the world declares peace causing a massive rally in stocks, making profits “a business illusion”  this is trading places at the international intergalactic level based on seniority of Getty
221 2018-02-07 22:23:52 The bottom line of every company is profit. Wrestling isn't as big as it was in 98, that was 20 years ago. They're moving with the times, you just don't like it. If the business was doing so bad the stocks would be going down along with confidence. They're not.
222 2018-02-07 22:23:52 ممكن يرتفع ما تعرف
223 2018-02-07 22:23:43 @AArchitectsYT where do you see junior mining stocks on TSX Venture going in 2018?
224 2018-02-07 22:23:36 Yeah it is my opinion? Doesn't mean I'm right. I was right at the moment as the Hidden Lake news drove the stock higher but with the SQM news and the correction, $FAT and all stocks suffered. Like why the hell does everyone complain about everything
225 2018-02-07 22:22:32 #FTSE100 +1.9% at 7,279 amid 'bargain hunting' following the previous day's heavy losses. Have stocks fallen sufficiently for investors to see value once again? #SuperThursday, Bank of England's quarterly Inflation Report; minutes from the latest meeting and a rate announcement.
226 2018-02-07 22:22:29 Very true, we will see swings in both direction for stocks, but the overall backdrop is now changing in my opinion.
227 2018-02-07 22:22:17 hahahah omg what an idiot why are you not taking credit for them going down . YOu know why they went down people are taking thier stocks out till your not president anymore LOL . MAKE AMERICA SAFE VOTE DEMOCRAT.
228 2018-02-07 22:21:52 العملات المشفرة....ترفض الإستسلام
والأسواق الأمريكية تغلق حمراء لترفع من إحتمالية أن ما حدث بالأمس كان "قفزة القط المحتضر"
والنفط يتصفع
واليورو يتعرض لنزيف يومي حاد لم يشهده منذ عام
العالم معتفس
والناس تنتظر من سوقنا يرتد

الله يعين
229 2018-02-07 22:21:51 That's where my investments are, in retirement account mutual funds. But that's it. No individual stocks, nothing outside 401k or IRA.
230 2018-02-07 22:21:08 no, people buy stock at the best price they can and when it sores to a great value they sell it and make money so stocks go up and stocks go down dont really have anything to do with the govt bthey just make it look that way
231 2018-02-07 22:20:55 ...until buffett announces that he bought a crapload of stocks during this crash...
232 2018-02-07 22:20:43 Law of Physics!!! For every equal rise in Stock Market results in equal fall = Balance!!! Also, great opportunity for others to enter Stock Market and purchase stocks when low.
233 2018-02-07 22:20:34 But, yeah, a headline about happy, unrelated things means nothing to stocks.
234 2018-02-07 22:20:27  stocks keep rising bitch its litty
235 2018-02-07 22:20:23 Stocks have always gone down when hints of inflation start, but wages going up means inflation goes up too.  This is the way it has always been.  You have as much understanding of the stock market as governance.
236 2018-02-07 22:20:02 The markets are unforgiving, and emotional trading always results in losses. forex stocks
237 2018-02-07 22:18:24 False.  Black Bear.  Historically good economic news can mean upward pressure on rates which can be bearish for stocks.
238 2018-02-07 22:18:08 @ValentineShow Who holds the Stocks at these companies are paying money to in order to buy their own stock back? Are we to believe that companies giving money to people who hold their stocks as a bad thing?
239 2018-02-07 22:17:44 Or buy our stocks for at least 12 euros and go ur own way #Goddijnresign
240 2018-02-07 22:17:32 How are your stocks today?
241 2018-02-07 22:16:45 As Sen Casey points out companies are using a lot of the tax cut $$ to buy back their own stocks. That benefits their investors, not the employees or consumers.
242 2018-02-07 22:15:46 Squeeze in energy stocks is coming...
243 2018-02-07 22:14:34 Love going to visit Loz,she always stocks up on my favourite scran 
244 2018-02-07 22:14:30 Bonds couldn't catch a bid on Friday/Monday until stocks crashed in last hour.   Rates not high enough to promote flight to bonds--YET.
245 2018-02-07 22:14:28 When WALL ST. TRAITORS took the market down 1600 pts. they sent a clear message to you and DC that they control the future of America and not politicians who falsely say the rise/fall of stocks belongs to them. Where is YOUR SEC CHAIRMAN JAY CLAYTON? No word from his strange!
246 2018-02-07 22:14:10 He has destroyed our government.  Made our country the laughing stocks of the world. Unfortunately you can't see the nose on your own face so let's just say goodbye to each other.
247 2018-02-07 22:13:52 Without clicking i bet this quotes Artemis.  That’s the figure they use in their papers. Assuming it’s grouping everything neg correl to stocks. Entire ETF universe is like $4 trillion so can’t imagine how strick vol Short is $2 trill.
248 2018-02-07 22:13:47 It has nothing to do with how much money I have. It has to do with the REALITY that yes....you can, and people do short penny stocks.   There are numerous reporting sites that give you the short percentages. And yes the MM's are the biggest offenders.
249 2018-02-07 22:13:46 Like Moore’s Law, except for timing stocks wrong.
250 2018-02-07 22:13:07 What about the small print, Paul? 
"Neil Woodford, one of Britain's best known fund managers, believes the economy will defy gloomy forecasts and that UK stocks look cheap."
251 2018-02-07 22:12:41 You have no clue what is happening with stocks.
252 2018-02-07 22:12:34 I’m determined to learn financial literacy, stocks and bonds, saving and overall wealth. I’m tired of my current lifestyle
253 2018-02-07 22:11:53 That's what happens when there are more mutual funds than there are stocks...
254 2018-02-07 22:11:15 Britni, lives on Seagate Ave with too many horses.

Put all their savings into banana stocks. Can't retire.
255 2018-02-07 22:11:15 Caveat: armchair crypto observer. #bitcoin traded well today as stocks/bonds fell. While crypto has problems, US debt rises & with it fiat $ questionable. #bitcoin bears have been taking victory laps. Technically the selloff looks corrective; #btc futures specs short. Back 2 20k?

260 2018-02-07 22:09:49 @karenfinerman You are right.  I am a small retail investor and when stocks are as high as they were a week ago,  I did not feel safe.  I knew a correction was coming so a low vix does not necessarily feel safe

262 2018-02-07 22:09:46 CNBC's Brian Sullivan just wondered out loud if the VIX is driving stocks rather than the other way around. Correlations this week support this view.
263 2018-02-07 22:09:36 Basically the market has fulfilled a bear narrative. We had a blow off equity top into a rate spike which then saw stocks tank into a bond rally. Bonds have now corrected back to where they started while equity valuations have moved a bit lower. The grind higher will resume
264 2018-02-07 22:07:37 2 An adjustment does not lose billions of dollars in a matter of hours across a wide range of stocks.  If you don't know that this is an alarming change then you shouldn't speak.
265 2018-02-07 22:07:06 What about stocks and shares?

267 2018-02-07 22:05:45 Shocking. Unhelpful. Shortsighted. Hopefully the exception not the rule. The problem I find with "out of stocks" is it's all well & good to "look for an alternative in the bnf" but that might be out of stock too! Community Pharmacy best placed to let us know what is available
268 2018-02-07 22:04:38 Perhaps in the most placid of time, but not when the world and political situation could explode at any time, and when stocks have edged into what arguably was bubble territory. They were just asking to get slaughtered, and their wish was granted.

279 2018-02-07 21:59:58 SpaceX is privately held so no stocks (and also gets significant $$$ from government/taxpayers). So yes, it’s good they increase visibility, but that doesn’t mean a Tesla in space would be better than an equivalent weight science/exploration payload.

281 2018-02-07 21:58:07 They chosed news headlines about success not about fail. And that is difference between science and commerce. They have to worry about their stocks at the market.

289 2018-02-07 21:55:00 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-06, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (6/6):
290 2018-02-07 21:54:59 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-06, these stocks have buy signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (6/6):
291 2018-02-07 21:54:43 I think I got this figured out according to Dimms. When stocks rise, it's Obama's economy but when stocks drop, it's @realDonaldTrump  economy.
292 2018-02-07 21:53:35 That being said, my ISA stocks & shares accounts (hsbc world selection) have done generally well for me the past few years
293 2018-02-07 21:53:04 Dude, if you care this much about it, start buying up stocks every time the market drops.  You can make a difference!
294 2018-02-07 21:53:04 Haha -> "Shortly after the November 2016 election, Icahn said, he left Trump's  victory party early to take advantage of the market dip and bet about $1  billion on stocks."
295 2018-02-07 21:52:33 See how trump is trying to blame the news for the falling stocks ? He refuses outright to accept blame for anything.

He accepts all the credit for it going up ....but won't take credit for it going down. 

He has no sense of responsibility.
296 2018-02-07 21:52:24 Both risk-on assets that don’t represent the real value of the “underlying”. QE fuels stocks and speculation fuels BTC.
297 2018-02-07 21:51:30 Companies have been buying back stock instead of dividends. The supply of actual company stock is shrinking. Meanwhile, financial capital to invest in stocks is increasing due to government deficits/corporate tax cuts. Historical averages mean nothing in this context.
298 2018-02-07 21:51:25 I just don’t understand it supposedly went up on all the good news before .but on the days it goes down it is because it is ignoring good news. It is in fact because the economy is doing well that in interest rates are going up and are looking like a better investment than stocks
299 2018-02-07 21:50:50 Lol...very glad I got of the whole space...I got out when I saw stocks diverging Vs commodity

Coincidentally my bad streak ended once I stopped trading this complex

Now first criteria in my process is cash flow :)

305 2018-02-07 21:48:46 *thinks*

The stocks was the symbolical identifying image of the village I grew up in, used in all their merchandise/propaganda/communications/whathaveyou. So there may be some unconscious bias creeping in there. Still, I agree with past-possibly-brainwashed-me anyway.
306 2018-02-07 21:48:37 Lucas smokes fight behind dandruff stocks ??   
307 2018-02-07 21:48:25 And QE didn't do anything to drive up prices in the equity market. It did not create "money" to invest in stocks. Exactly who do you think got to buy stocks with the "money" that QE created? So tired of hearing this one.
308 2018-02-07 21:48:20 @RedDogT3 yea, I was on that 50-day mov avg in $SPX and many stocks as well to lighten up on stocks and start building protection. Still think a large part of the market, ETFs etc are loaded with v/hi valuation stocks that need to come down as rates, stimulus/spending, usd rise

311 2018-02-07 21:45:58 Zero to do w obama.  And the fall past few days occurred bc of computer algorithms set to go off when stocks reach certain levels.  Nothing at all to suggest them to fall otherwise.  Please don't tour obama bc his disaster of a presidency destroyed the economy.
312 2018-02-07 21:45:44 I.e. alt... penny stocks.
313 2018-02-07 21:45:36 I say we bring back the stocks. They were a great idea. Punishment doesn’t cost the perpetrator anything, no long lasting damage, just a short period of embarrassment to rue on their transgressions. What’s not to love here
314 2018-02-07 21:45:35 Hi Greg what would u say is the safest play when the bond market implodes? PM? Can you also give an update on cryptos, or is it just a case of that market following stocks at this time. Cheers
315 2018-02-07 21:44:20 At $DAYJOB, the CEO said a few years ago they were buying back stocks because the interest rate on debt was cheaper than the rate of dividends the stockholders were getting. If it's long-term debt, inflation doesn't bother that much.
316 2018-02-07 21:44:18 As Warren Buffett was once reported to say after being asked a similar question: "It's not like I was going to sell those stocks today anyway."

321 2018-02-07 21:41:25 The country’s strongest region for wine is not invincible & a legit boycott could def hurt. But BC wine couldn't ask for a better endorsement than @RachelNotley's desperate pitch for pipeline support. Maybe this will finally improve the LCBO's stocks of NK'MIP and Osoyoos-Larose?
322 2018-02-07 21:40:57 I guess i’m finally approved for trading penny stocks. 
323 2018-02-07 21:39:56 Stocks are just the only thing @realDonaldTrump has taken credit for while they were up.Yesterday all of his tweets taking credit for the stocks were deleted.
324 2018-02-07 21:39:52 Just sell some stocks if you don't have liquid cash to cover the purchase. This isn't rocket science.
325 2018-02-07 21:38:57 No other reason other than to increase cash position from 7%. I feel I was too weighted in stocks, ideally I would like to have at least 20% cash. Rules are rules so need to rotate and felt #SFR had a run and paused a bit

331 2018-02-07 21:36:43 No matter how twitter views $vktx about nash upcoming data but stocks momentum after secondary can’t be ignored. It is making new highs despite how volatile this market is from last several days. This doesn’t look like retail buying.
332 2018-02-07 21:35:00 The top five stocks that fell today were $CMG, $MCHG, $CHK, $MRO, and $FTI.

335 2018-02-07 21:34:00 Nope. Rates are gonna go negative.  Bonds go up, stocks go down.  Stocks go down market crashes. FED has already exhausted current tools.  Only plays left are a full system reboot or negative rates.

337 2018-02-07 21:33:42 MVES going way over .01, the market cap is only $2.5 million right now. Let’s just think about that for a second..

339 2018-02-07 21:33:32 the past 10Years does highlight that the regulators had learned nothing....

The other point of view that the StockMarket is strong enough on its own & the #Fed should get out of the way. Once rates > 5%, a lot of "investors" will be out of stocks
340 2018-02-07 21:33:31 Bumping stocks , is what the hunters do in their tent. After a long day in the woods together.  They're getting meat.
341 2018-02-07 21:33:29 You guys fucking rule! I am definitely buying some of your stocks someday!
342 2018-02-07 21:33:27 The top five most active stocks today were $GE, $CHK, $F, $AMD, and $AAPL
343 2018-02-07 21:33:21 Because stocks go up and down? It was up big yesterday, all the FAANG stocks were weak today, all need to build a base before trying to regain the ground they lost. Apple has been my most heavily traded stock over last 5 years, it rarely does what you want it to do.
344 2018-02-07 21:32:24 Still think that we are in August 2011 and August 2015 kind of environment.. which means lows in stocks will get revisited and followed by 1-2 week of digestion and disinversion of the $VIX complex before the market proceeds higher

366 2018-02-07 21:22:02 The thing that dissillusioned me about the whole thing was when I realized stocks were a way for companies to borrow money without ever having to pay it back, and that socks had no real effect on the company, except financial due dilligence.
367 2018-02-07 21:21:53 US stocks finally ended trading session of today slightly lower and the $VIX down 11.64% to 26.49

371 2018-02-07 21:20:22 A market adjustment is an up to 10% drop, and this was in total 8.7% so yes that adjustment. FYI stocks are still to the positive since Trump took office. If you don't understand how the market works, don't comment. It's a normal thing.

393 2018-02-07 21:13:39 MM's short stocks constantly when there is a buying surge. They also drive the price down when the volume drops off so they can cover their positions and pocket the difference.
394 2018-02-07 21:13:26 IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT! 
You told everyone that it was you that made the stocks go up.

STOP DOING THIS!!!

399 2018-02-07 21:12:15 Why ban “ bump stocks”? No need. You see after each mass shooting or shooting by weapons that are automatic or converted by “bump stocks” the @gop , the @SenateGOP , the @HouseGOP , and @realDonaldTrump send “thoughts and prayers”. NRA is happy that way. GOP is happy too!
400 2018-02-07 21:12:07 I'm very bearish on $YELP... This will never change.. Stock is down 9% right now after Q4 results.. Love IT! #Stocks

403 2018-02-07 21:11:00 Fine, move on and leave us alone. I'm sure you have other stocks you can bash. This is the OTC world and we have good things on the horizon.
404 2018-02-07 21:10:12 Today in the AM was the time to sell. 
The out of control spending (add'l $1T), rising rates & inflation are major #StockMarket downers.

Not looking good from here for #stocks. Time to trim & sell into rallies
405 2018-02-07 21:10:10 I was listening to @BloombergRadio and the discussion was ETF holdings and how many of them are  concentrated in the same holdings.
They mentioned 44% of QQQ holdings are in just five stocks.
406 2018-02-07 21:10:04 Stocks up 45% tho

410 2018-02-07 21:08:39 I don't think so. Global Economy is doing very well and Stocks suddenly got a lot cheaper. I think 8000 on FTSE100 far more likely than 6000 this year.
411 2018-02-07 21:07:22 Stocks veer from recovery; end negative. The Dow peaked at 25,293, then fell 400 to close at 24,893.35, down 19.42 (-0.08%). Nasdaq -0.90%. S&P -0.50%.

421 2018-02-07 21:02:21 That close was hilarious. I got home 8 minutes ago and the Dow was up 250 and I was up a lot. I wound up closing up $21 - lolol #DOW $NASDAQ #Stocks #Volatility
422 2018-02-07 21:01:54 I'd much rather root for higher wages for American workers than a higher stock market. The top 10% owns 90% of all stocks in the US.

427 2018-02-07 20:59:30 ...and an unhealthy obsession with tech stocks.

429 2018-02-07 20:58:35 Bill, do you have any article about selling rules for long term holdings of winner stocks? eg, $ANET is so volatile that one could give up a massive part of the profits should it just suddenly reverse one day, hence what would be a good approach to exit?
430 2018-02-07 20:58:13 10-year Treasury yield up 8 basis points to 2.85% heading into the close here. Stocks seem relatively okay with it but that $2 billion+ MOC to sell looms
431 2018-02-07 20:57:28 Should be fine. Will double check stocks tomorrow.
432 2018-02-07 20:56:54 *Remember its only market manipulation if stocks fall, if they go up its just a beast mode market.
433 2018-02-07 20:55:58 Hey Dumbass! Stocks go up and down!!! You over - inflated! You can't only see the happy happy joy joy! There's disappointment too.! You know like when you have relations with your wife, that ok is not admiration it is bitter disappointment!!!
434 2018-02-07 20:54:47 Market in significant backwardation for several months. H-Z8 at $5 last week. We have been getting inventory draws but product builds. Some might argue that stocks are ample and backwardation partly driven by speculative flows which focus on the front end vs hedging in deferred

438 2018-02-07 20:53:14 Today was much more normal for the stock market than the last three days, but stocks still swung around a bunch and investors seem unsure about what's going to happen next.
439 2018-02-07 20:53:11 It's dropping because we are mean to him and the only way it will go up is to have a parade! We have to make Trump smile and then the clouds smile and then the stocks rise!

441 2018-02-07 20:52:52 #TodaysTip: Diversify those funds. Stocks and other portfolio's can be lucrative, but fluctuate.  Invest some money into real estate for a sense of stability

451 2018-02-07 20:50:29 So this is a catch 22? Good news: stocks up, good news: stocks down. So... given your preach of all the fake news/bad news that has been reported and stocks rise, should anything change? I'm confused about the nature of your tweet.
452 2018-02-07 20:49:57 CBOT Mch wht up A$8.57/t to A$216.44. Money moving from equities to commodities. Ongoing weather worries for the US crop. However the USDA Report is expected to lift US stocks a fraction but reduce global stocks a fraction.
453 2018-02-07 20:49:42 Not accurate as a statement.

As the economy improves it causes wages and interest rates to rise.

As this occurs decisions about stocks start focusing on the  inflation and pressures on their stocks. Till stabilises.

So in  this case not a one off.

Part of a normal pattern.
454 2018-02-07 20:49:41 Stocks have made a very powerful enemy.

464 2018-02-07 20:44:55 hah, i enjoy it. the market is too frothy now, way overpriced. only stocks i like are the renewable energy MLPs like BEP, NEP, TERP. They pay 7% and own solar and wind assets that have guaranteed 20 year contracts.
465 2018-02-07 20:44:24 It's a bit too powerful tbh, people like to place their stocks into one large thing to follow than each individual

471 2018-02-07 20:42:47 Moron said it's a "big mistake" for stocks to slide when there's so much "good news". NO! It's a big mistake for him to tie his performance (or lack of) to the stock market. Dumb sh*t. 
472 2018-02-07 20:42:39 Right BUT it was enabled by record longs in stocks and these leveraged ETFS i.e. all one way with no pullback - markets only go up = insanity :)
473 2018-02-07 20:42:33 CNBC was really entertaining today: "Yeah that was an nifty drawdown here... Wait, no drawdown is good but I like stocks here"

Translation: I need to get the hell out and I need bag holders. Would you hold the bag for me, please?
474 2018-02-07 20:42:20 If Fed aggressively raises interest rates to fight inflation, it will remove one of the drivers of the bull market. Bc of that fear, investors sold bonds, which drove yields to four-year highs. Higher yields make risky stocks look less attractive by comparison. Thus the sell-off.

503 2018-02-07 20:33:09 Stocks and shares can't be compared to crypto. We don't own a share in the company, so you don't owe us anything. We don't have a say in decisions, and we don't make profit from dividends. Our money is intrinsically linked to the value of the token.
504 2018-02-07 20:33:08 On second thought, I'd be happy to see a parade in DC if @POTUS was in the lead... being escorted in chains or maybe in old fashioned stocks.

532 2018-02-07 20:24:12 Paul "the expert market  stock market predictor" is back talking about stocks...
533 2018-02-07 20:23:39 Year 1 had a great time today at Tamworth Castle. The children explored the ramparts and found out about life in a medieval castle. A few also ended up in the stocks (though were allowed out before the journey home). Thanks to all of the parents who helped.
534 2018-02-07 20:23:13 Really, come on..... the top 20 market capitalization stocks in the S&P 500 have really "undiverse" workforces... That's a fact. Facts are stubborn things...

539 2018-02-07 20:21:26 Trading stocks is a bitch-ass way to make money. Find what you like to do. Help people. Create something. Don't be like one of these guys who trade all day because they all have erectile dysfunction.
540 2018-02-07 20:20:53 That may be so but it’s just opinion. Correlation doesn’t equal causation. Under Obama, the market rallied once the Fed said they’d bail out the banks and print money not because of Obama himself. Now that the Fed is tightening, stocks might stall or fall. Won’t be Trumps fault.
541 2018-02-07 20:20:52 Also the crashing precious metals are showing that something is going wrong.Normally when we have reflation with 3% growth, then all asset classes (stocks, bonds, precious metals and real estate) are going up in a bull market but now even gold is falling in favour of the BRICS.
542 2018-02-07 20:20:44 Need to add arrows and captions for Dalio saying "you will feel really stupid holding cash" and Tepper saying "Stocks seem as inexpensive now as they did during the beginning of 2017"   :)
543 2018-02-07 20:19:08 Yeah it was notable how 'orderly' it was - in proper Panics the volatility goes nuts and Stocks often fall all day long. They actually recovered in many cases. Very artificial.
544 2018-02-07 20:18:56 stock market is part of the economy. Stock market going down is thought of as bad news. Reality? People make money when stocks go down.  I used to write about this stuff. We get all freaked out about our 401Ks and some day trader is cashing in. How about paying attention to that?
545 2018-02-07 20:18:35 theory is that crypto was doing well while stock market volatility was low, so now it's going to track stocks and go down with it
546 2018-02-07 20:18:05 i got 50 stocks $amzn bidding 1062 and another 50 at 962 for $amzn. this is 200dma and below 200dma. you never know the algo's lol.
547 2018-02-07 20:17:46 For a technical wizard, you sure don't use terminology
Stocks are equity, they're an asset or a debt depending on what is attempting to be done.
548 2018-02-07 20:17:22 Not to worry. They are all being allocated into #DJIA stocks instead.
549 2018-02-07 20:17:17 You're basing your opinion on tv ratings, something that's on the decline across the board because of new media and new ways to watch the shows. TV ratings don't prove a thing, money does. Profits make the stocks rise and losses make the stocks fall.

571 2018-02-07 20:09:52 DJT is right. Price of crude oil goes down...good news to purchasers of gasoline and other products,but its bad news for oil investors, which is why the value of oil stocks (the paper kind)  goes down.

573 2018-02-07 20:08:25 I agree with you there....  stocks dislike rising interest rates and inflation, right?
574 2018-02-07 20:07:47 F@$k the haters! They may have dipped, but they are STILL HIGHER then the Liar Obama! Least we forget? Under Obama, the stocks went WAY DOWN? EVEN when they came up, it wasn't enough to cover the MAJOR DOWNWARD DIP the stocks took. REMEMBER THAT HATERS!!!! Go Trump!!!!
575 2018-02-07 20:07:44 The “big mistake” is you in the White House. You took all the credit when stocks were soaring, so you should accept blame when they fall.

601 2018-02-07 19:56:58 Dude, the news had nothing to do with this drop. Do you have any idea how stocks work or did you hear Fox say something about that being a benefit of your presidency (which it is not) one time and you have just run with it? It really seems like the latter is true.
602 2018-02-07 19:55:48 Contd...this means as much as you think $AMZN might rule the universe fundamentally for the next decade, the company is different from the shares, and this should be respected. E.g. $CSCO peaked in '00 at 82 and today is at 40 after being as low as 8 #stocks

610 2018-02-07 19:54:21 Fortunately all the insanely inflationary things he wanted to do in the first year like starting trade wars and evicting our agricultural workforce were blocked by the courts or not inacted by a somewhat less crazy congress.  Inflation is the mortal enemy of stocks.

613 2018-02-07 19:52:52 BTW if any of you traffic in media stocks, 1) you're a braver person than I am (lesson learned) and 2) the more volatile the markets, the more clicks for financial media.  Fact.  I prefer @realvision tho; they're killing it.

652 2018-02-07 19:36:01 Actually, I think that comment was what we were all thinking. If “fake news” makes the stocks fall, then when the stocks had been rising during the first year of the catastrophe, does that make all that news real after all? Thanks, Obama.

657 2018-02-07 19:35:02 Amazing how resilient the spec longs in CAD are especially:
- as oil prices and energy stocks keep rolling over, 
- the Fed hiking rates, 
- Cdn real estate rolling over, 
- broader market volatility picking up.

659 2018-02-07 19:34:07 I invested in a company called $MVES which some people would have thought was absurd to do so, until today when the company skyrocketed 346.67% on the stock market. The Movie Studio Inc. Hmmm Kinda makes ya wonder what Grove really knows tho #HyperspaceSurveillance #stocks $(%
660 2018-02-07 19:33:55 Hey, chimps can sometimes do better at picking stocks, compared to the experts.  The key to understanding markets is behavioral economics.
661 2018-02-07 19:33:30 $TLT breaking 119 can't potentially be a problem for stock market bulls, nope, no way, no how, that is, not until stocks are down 1% 
662 2018-02-07 19:32:58 What percentage of homes is bought by credit in US?

665 2018-02-07 19:32:20 Wow your stocks look like they're doing really well
666 2018-02-07 19:32:07 Word! Now that I think about it, I didn’t meet/know a black person that owned stocks growing up until my junior year of college. And I found out on accident. Hard to teach things that you don’t know. #ViciousCycle
667 2018-02-07 19:30:42 Any stock that does not give out a Dividend has no “intrinsic” value. *Cough cough* most tech stocks. Are those also going to zero?

688 2018-02-07 19:19:40 I need stocks to go up . I was so excited a month ago
689 2018-02-07 19:18:50 I think this was O'Reilly or maybe Rush who said:  Democrats might have sold a lot of their stocks to bring the market down.  Then they will buy back at a lower cost. If true - Democrats will stoop very low to win. Shame on them.
690 2018-02-07 19:18:43 Stocks Picker @anandchokshi19 not picking any stock now...why
691 2018-02-07 19:18:22 Nice job of the stocks. Now his Nazi like parade is in the works.
692 2018-02-07 19:18:19 I once considered penny stocks. Like, hey this is only $5? cool! I'll toss $20 bucks at 'em and see what happens.

Then I found out that you needed $1000 to get your foot in the door.

Ummm... For 200 shares of Amalgamated-Fly-By-Night?

Nope.

I could gamble $20 but not $1000.
693 2018-02-07 19:18:19 Let's all stop pretending we care or understand what any of that means. Even day traders and company execs of the very companies who's stocks are being traded don't know what it means!
694 2018-02-07 19:18:19 Stay Informed On The Hottest Stocks: TransGlobe Energy Corporation (TGA), GeoPark Limited …
695 2018-02-07 19:18:17 I don’t like the new Snapchat update but the stocks did. My stocks went up 30% overnight 
696 2018-02-07 19:16:40 One guest says the market is going up the next says down and so on. Buffet, Ican and Cooperman say who knows but long term good stocks are going up.
697 2018-02-07 19:16:03 LOL stocks? That's so 1931
698 2018-02-07 19:15:48 30 stocks and 8 ETFs
699 2018-02-07 19:15:17 And higher wages mean more inflation, hurting profits.  The fed and/or banks raise interest rates, so stocks are no longer the only game in town.
700 2018-02-07 19:15:12 Oh,so now CNBC brings Cramer into its anti Trump propaganda campaign.  I would suggest that deregulation and tax policy had a positive impact on stocks and a correction w/program selling doesn’t change it.Wish Cramer would have stayed out of politics. I used to enjoy watching him
701 2018-02-07 19:14:35 Bitcoin or in fact,any Crypto currency has no legal tender doesn't mean Crypto is banned. Legal tender refers to the notes and coins issued by the reserve Bank. gold,silver,diamonds,stocks,bonds also have no legal tender! Are they banned?
702 2018-02-07 19:13:36 Trust me, I feel your pain. It's hard to hold something like this with so many stocks offering apparent buys out there.  If people sell to move on or reduce missed opportunity costs...I get it.  But sitting on my hands is what I do best. So here I sit. $SYBX
703 2018-02-07 19:13:24 ret educator in stock market doing ok with stocks that give dividends any suggestions ???
704 2018-02-07 19:13:14 You're a fool, a complete fool.
Stocks are debt.
So when a company buys back stocks they reduce debt.
Your article doesn't say ONLY stock buybacks are occurring just staggeringly more than last year.
Furthermore article says stock value increases which benefits 401k & pensions
705 2018-02-07 19:13:01 The news is that the stocks crashed because of you. Simple.

710 2018-02-07 19:10:11 My three older coworkers are all standing around my desk while I'm trying to work and talking about how much money they've lost in the past week in stocks and I've never wanted to kill myself more than this moment.
711 2018-02-07 19:09:38 Stocks that are currently still a cheap price to buy before they take off. #watchlist $APP $IDK $GRAT $ICM $FLGC $ISM  JMO ;) always do your DD. Big things coming to these in the near future.  ;) cheers
712 2018-02-07 19:09:38 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
713 2018-02-07 19:09:29 Oil and gas stocks getting crushed today. Gap widens further to oil prices.
714 2018-02-07 19:09:25 but it's comparing apples to oranges. basically, trump said institutions selling stocks was a big mistake when there is so much good economic news. i have people screaming at me that 45 is a dictator! because her post is linked to the borowitz thing.
715 2018-02-07 19:09:06 $weed has gone red I think we’ll see some marijuana stocks drop a little end of day I sold $cann at .59 and will likely renter eod or tomorrow
716 2018-02-07 19:08:49 Quantitative easing, in the U.S and abroad, created an artificial dream scenario of low volatility/high returns for stocks... Stocks can still go higher, but that world ended on Feb 2/5
717 2018-02-07 19:08:27 The Stock Market is based on what people feel the stocks should be worth. And when it gets unrealistically high, it comes down, no matter what the news is. Maybe you should take a business class sometime...
718 2018-02-07 19:08:03 But were you trading stocks then?
719 2018-02-07 19:07:55 $YTRA beast mode into the 8s!
720 2018-02-07 19:07:23 Could it be that republicans are invested in insurance stocks and don't want universal health care messing with thier profits?
721 2018-02-07 19:07:15 My opinion on recent stock market activity:  I still put money onto quality stocks to cost average whether the market is up or down.  Don't let the market scare you.  Kepp saving and investing for your future.
722 2018-02-07 19:06:29 A base de agotar los stocks...
723 2018-02-07 19:05:55 Donald, this shows just how little you understand about how the markets work. Interests rates rise, the equities markets react negatively because people will transition to fixed income. When unemployment drops, or there’s any other positive news, the Fed raises rates. Stocks drop
724 2018-02-07 19:05:43 If you have deliberately not bought overvalued stocks and have been patient, while all around you are investing like there never will be a marked correction, can you be in the mental state to buy when market is falling. Else fear and shock takes over. @porinju
725 2018-02-07 19:05:27 When stocks rose, the left didnt give Trump credit, when they fell, Trump got the blame, so who'll the left give credit for the bounce back, probably Obama...
726 2018-02-07 19:05:03 But but but all those tv experts say we should just keep buying stocks cause #EverythingIsAwesome
727 2018-02-07 19:03:56 lets see what happens from now untill 3 oclock....the margin needs to be paid at 1       i am sure that is why stocks swung 300 points in last 30 min....they sell the big nasdaq stocks for easy liquidity

732 2018-02-07 19:02:36 Thank you for making this important step happen. I hope this brings focus to our declining wild Atlantic Salmon stocks and addressing corporations that try to harm our environment and marine species.
733 2018-02-07 19:02:07 Consider sticking in an order at a level you'd be happy to sell it at. Those stocks move so fast that by the time you react, you end up missing the boat.
734 2018-02-07 19:02:06 Woke up and checked my stocks this morning, to find out my $SNAP shares are booming today. 
735 2018-02-07 19:02:03 I like how people in the traditional stock market say "You guys just want to make money!" To #crypto investors, as if they would even be involved in stocks if there were no profits. Do you think people would still drink and "like" the taste of whisky if it didn't get you buzzed?
736 2018-02-07 19:01:22 Wife beater in whitehouse, political kidnapper Flynn was also in this White House. 
Woman who resigned trading stocks directly affected by the agency which she was heading was also in this whitehouse.
737 2018-02-07 19:01:18 Loving the increase in #stocks volatility. Good for day trades. Medium-long term investors just need to tune out the day-to-day noise and focus on the bigger picture
738 2018-02-07 19:01:10 Would love to hear your comments on how you "handle" stocks after buying; do you follow O'Neil & take profits at 20%, etc. great posts, thnx
739 2018-02-07 19:00:23 What?Previous Presidents didn't care about the value of the countries stocks.If so that would scream Scout leader not POTUS.However i have an inkling your tweet contains a falsehood.

746 2018-02-07 18:58:21 No. There's no risk. If you can't lose money, you're not taking on any risk. That's like saying a savings bond is "risky" because you could make more money in stocks. Owning a big 4 franchise is like buying a savings bond.

753 2018-02-07 18:56:27 #Stocks | When the rates began to move higher today seemed to be when the selling started to pick up in the market. That’s a long-term concern that’s out there. After the waterfall decline we had on Friday $ Monday, people are just hyper-sensitive. - Weatherstone $DJIA $SPX $VIX
754 2018-02-07 18:55:45 When you start getting into stocks
755 2018-02-07 18:55:34 Some believe it works some don't, I think the latter. Sure, they'll spend some, mainly investments, stocks etc, but they won't chuck it around the general slush pool.
756 2018-02-07 18:54:57 some stocks r available as if Nifty is 9500.....  that was the statement......
757 2018-02-07 18:54:11 Have you heard of computer generated sell- offs?  Please give me one indicator that the current state of the economy had anything to do with the major decline in stocks?
758 2018-02-07 18:54:07 @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @charliekirk11 @TuckerCarlson don't you think that after the state of the union and Trump talking about Infrastructure that people started selling stocks to reinvest in stock for infrastructure.That's exactly what I would do, so watch for it to go up
759 2018-02-07 18:54:04 Well in the old days, the President didn't try to affect the value of the stocks going up and down like you. For some reason, this just doesn't really scream "World Leader" to me.
760 2018-02-07 18:53:37 US 10-yr back to 2.85%, it's no wonder stocks have put in a mid-afternoon reversal. Lets see what happens heading into the close

761 2018-02-07 18:53:36 Usually with the cheaper penny stocks, when the volume is gone, the pump and dump is over. Not saying this was a pump and dump, but I've seen it many times.
762 2018-02-07 18:53:31 Gov approves tax cuts-pay rises- stocks fall-401k drops—personal gain=0 or even less. “The house always wins”
763 2018-02-07 18:53:16 $MVES 0.0065 +325% Congratulations 
764 2018-02-07 18:53:07 I think that’s related to their company stocks plummeting in their respective exchanges.. not related to cryptos if I’m correct :)
765 2018-02-07 18:52:30 Or speculation on stocks is a legal form of gambling across all states
766 2018-02-07 18:52:29 Now that the stock market is no longer crashing, bond prices have resumed their decline.  Yields are now higher than they were before stocks crashed. They will keep climbing until stocks crash again.  The dance will continue until both markets eventually crash together!
767 2018-02-07 18:51:53 Just make murder illegal already...Problem solved. Now we can quit blaming guns, stocks, ammo....ect.
768 2018-02-07 18:51:46 I thought stocks traded on fundamentals , must have been a negative earnings forcast for both at the exact same time .
769 2018-02-07 18:51:43 yet another misleading infographic. lets look at the 6 month gain of some penny stocks and compare them too, why don't we?
770 2018-02-07 18:51:32 just sold one of my stocks and made $200 from 5 shares. life is good rn

772 2018-02-07 18:51:20 UK Market Close: Relief rally buoys stocks
773 2018-02-07 18:51:09 I've been tweeting for everyone to buy the Stocks that Demos sold since they are at low prices right now. Dems were trying to make the market crash.
774 2018-02-07 18:51:06 Stocks are still mixed, with DOW at 172, NASDAQ -14, S&P 500 +6; MBS -19bps; 10yr Treasury up to 2.83% at mid-day action.
775 2018-02-07 18:50:54 deficits are fine, so long as the Dollar is cheap enough to finance them. All that matters is that their is growth and a rising stock market. 
Stocks telling us, it wants a weaker Dollar to compensate for higher rates.
776 2018-02-07 18:50:31 The stock market isn’t down, the stocks are all just on sale. You’re welcome.
777 2018-02-07 18:50:08 "The tweet did not elaborate on what he meant by the 'old days' or explain further his analysis of why stocks plummeted on Friday and Monday."

Love how dry that is.
778 2018-02-07 18:49:41 Instead of spending $200 on the next pair of shoes, put that money into stocks and purchase Nike and Boeing shares.
779 2018-02-07 18:48:15 I’m gettin nice wit these stocks. By the end of 2018 tryn do a stack a day capital gains flow
780 2018-02-07 18:47:59 Yeah I won’t go as far to say stocks are bad. Some of them have issues, but there are good ones, too. Same as people, cars, houses, and everything else. Lol
781 2018-02-07 18:47:28 Yes, but the "narrative" is supported so ... just buy stocks!
782 2018-02-07 18:47:12 But what if we put the markets into the stocks #breakthrough
783 2018-02-07 18:46:52 Not bc if news. Stocks went up; people made money amd wanted to keep it. Stocks go diwn; we buy again. You ARE familiar with this concept! You helped people make that money. Take credit for THAT!
784 2018-02-07 18:46:31 Dump stocks buy physical silver, silver is the reserve currency of Roman empire, the Christians do not deserve their wealth, they killed to attain their Kingdom.  The Death Curse is a real curse, and people 65 and older need to go on vacation permanently.

786 2018-02-07 18:45:48 Stocks rallying again. Now good news is good news.
787 2018-02-07 18:45:42 The overall expectation is for stocks to keep rising at a slower pace, because the odds seem low for a recession this year. The U.S. is getting an extra kick from recently passed tax cuts. The tax plan cuts have only begun to benefit and will continue to reap Investor rewards.
788 2018-02-07 18:44:56 I feel like buying some put spreads on FANG stocks.

Sell stocks, sell American business. Global business is at maximum sales right now, We never exceed now.
793 2018-02-07 18:43:02 If it’s risk off in the traditional sense then tsys are going to rally and support stocks along the way. 

The current USD rally is the market realising inflation is coming after a multitude of disappointingly conservative Fed outcomes.
794 2018-02-07 18:42:51 There’s the value of currently owned securities (that’s what stocks are called), which you can actually borrow against. Then, you trade a stock for currency, it’s because someone else paid to buy it. And there’s the currency market, but that may be too complex for Twitter.
795 2018-02-07 18:42:50 USD was big WITH stocks. Now its cooling down as stocks fall

798 2018-02-07 18:41:35 If you think  2.8%  on the 10 year bond is competition for stocks you can buy these bonds and then lose your ass on them when they go to a  10%  yield !!
799 2018-02-07 18:41:12 Finally!!! Indeed a historic moment for elephant conservation! It has been a long road from the highly publicized burning of ivory pile stocks by President Moi of Kenya in 1989, which I witnessed as a young UNEP professional!

802 2018-02-07 18:39:14 Some concerns about the stocks re-enters in the market. Bond auction soft. Correction in Nasdaq stalls at 50%.
And the tide turns...well a little
In the last hour or so, the US treasury had a sloppy auction with a larger than expected tail in the 10 year auction. The bid to …
803 2018-02-07 18:39:10 No, he's wrong because the markets are reacting to signs that we are reaching the end of the current growth cycle. Wages typically rise near the  end. And as you pointed out higher bond yields means people pull out of stocks. Same as always.
804 2018-02-07 18:38:54 In his 2018 State of the State, CT Governor Dannel Malloy called for gun reform, including a bump stocks ban - "Together, let us do what Congress could not do. Let’s close dangerous loopholes and ban bump stocks in the State of Connecticut"
805 2018-02-07 18:38:17 Stocks unwilling to drop and USD unwilling to keep highs.
806 2018-02-07 18:37:56 Volume is very scattered today between ETFs, Penny Stocks, and Crypto's. It is very tough to find a spike when attention is constantly bouncing to different areas. Stay Patient and wait for you play. #StockSniper
807 2018-02-07 18:37:35 You’ve got to have patience dealing with stocks.
808 2018-02-07 18:37:21 POTUS hyping stocks, something tells me this wont end well...
809 2018-02-07 18:37:18 Spice from the book "Dune" so I could see into the future and know what stocks to buy
810 2018-02-07 18:37:11 I just bought $10,000 with the stocks in glue
811 2018-02-07 18:36:43 Democrats historically print money which weakens the dollar. Weaker dollar creates higher prices, ie takes more to buy the same. This affects everything from stocks to gold, gas, commodities, milk.
As dollar strengthens, it will take lees to buy the same, ie, stocks, gas, etc.
812 2018-02-07 18:35:39 My grandfather was a Depression baby. A self made millionaire. That is EXACTLY what he would have done. He made a lot of money from stocks, but never trusted the market completely. He was a great believer in gold/gold coins
813 2018-02-07 18:35:32 There are bonds as well as stocks, dipshit
814 2018-02-07 18:35:14 Like I said, stocks HIGHLY volatile for a while.  Market Makers and Specialists just going to churn the uncertainty over rates.  Smart daytraders gonna kill for the next few months.
815 2018-02-07 18:34:55 dont put any value in @cnbc,, those clowns cant support their family on stocks that why they work for cnbs.  dont let your kids grow up to be in media,, they cant be trusted.
816 2018-02-07 18:34:45 All of that data is orthogonal to my point. Most is about stocks, not flows. Relentlessly, you return to talking about stocks, when talking about flows is of much greater relevance. 

I think you should change your focus accordingly. Stop getting sidetracked!!
817 2018-02-07 18:33:49 Chakri stocks hahha

819 2018-02-07 18:32:44 I guess you haven’t noticed when a company cuts costs, AKA has a major layoff,  the stock usually climbs. Gun company stock tends to shoot up when there is a mass shooting! Not sure were you got this BS about stocks going up with good news. Just more BS from potus!

822 2018-02-07 18:31:42 I received another question re the differences between my approach to position trading and Canslim. In 1995, I boiled canslim down to three things: 20%+ earnings estimate in next fiscal yr, high relative strength, and technical chart pattern. No changes since then #stocks

824 2018-02-07 18:31:19 Really bad idea. How about teaching kids about money. How to invest, revenue streams, stocks and shares, budgets. Give them something they can use all over the world. Instead of having badly educated fat ppl you will have badly educated skinny ppl!

844 2018-02-07 18:27:10 We've already seen one of the Brexiters advise his clients to move money from UK to European stocks. Doing that now and then moving it back afterwards is how you'd most likely profit from Brexit.
845 2018-02-07 18:27:06 Your examples have very similar growth objectives which will tie to similar stocks.  Important to select ETFs with different goals to get a mix.  Not just same index ETF from a different ETF provider.

855 2018-02-07 18:25:39 BrianSullivan, GREAT TOPIC, but what are the PEs of EACH of the stocks you highlighted (the top 15 stocks like $HD $AMZN, etc...).  But PLEASE don't ask the creators of ETFs, they will ALWAYS defend their products. ASK AN INDEPENDENT, TOP-RANKED ANALYST WITH NO HOLDINGS CONFLICTS
856 2018-02-07 18:25:03 Great time to buy bonds. As interest rates are rising. Obviously diversify. But, stocks right now are volatile.
857 2018-02-07 18:24:43 Mortgage Bond prices are modestly higher while Stocks are rallying after several days of extreme volatility. Locking is recommended.
858 2018-02-07 18:24:33 why do people even bother. Just avoid the bond bubble altogether and stick with stocks because they are far more safe and secure..
859 2018-02-07 18:24:14 stocks now react to higher rates intraday
860 2018-02-07 18:23:41 Say didn't YOU take credit for the stocks? In other words YOU took credit and you're denying it since its plummeting.
861 2018-02-07 18:23:08 It's like they don't even know how the stocks work? At this point they may as well be non stop entertainment shows.
862 2018-02-07 18:23:08 Remember: if you're going to buy and HODL, who cares if it's at the all time high. The same applies to the stock market. In fact, my FA tells me that you should also enter the stock market, pick the top 3 highest stocks and pour your life savings into them #HODLmentality

865 2018-02-07 18:22:42 From my working experience the best fixation is manipulation of existing particles to make new compounds, like manipulating stocks so that more input can be formed and bigger underwriting profits can be accrued. This is just my work, making value of voters data is the easiest.
866 2018-02-07 18:22:35 yeah crazy! wish I sold. I mean in reality if oil goes back to $50 Rig is still at similiar price. MU can't believe it's gone down today. I don't think I have what it takes to hold stocks long term, too much emotion. even airlines I sold out and now going up, then i rebuy high
867 2018-02-07 18:22:15 At 2.70 stocks are the bomb...at 2.85 run like hell!
868 2018-02-07 18:21:44 Higher bond rates + Higher VIX = Lower Stocks
869 2018-02-07 18:21:31 Mr. President you are correct.  The problem is electronic trading.  Much of it should be banned.  it pits the average investor against a machine with algorithms.  This didn't not exist 30 years ago.  All the naysayers here probably don't own stocks or understand.
870 2018-02-07 18:21:26 John Kelly: "Mr. President, actually, now, just like in the old days, if investors feared the market was overheating stocks went down due to concern over inflation and interest rates rising."  POTUS: "That's fake news, where'd you hear that, CNN?"

878 2018-02-07 18:18:09 Good stocks need three main characteristics. Quality companies, strong financial performance and solid balance sheets. A portfolio should be diversified across different market sectors (ex. Healthcare, Tech, Real Estate) I also want the stocks to pay dividends to shareholders.
879 2018-02-07 18:18:09 We are stuck in a negative feedback loop: stocks up, rates up....stocks crash, rates down, stocks up, rates up, stocks crash, rates down
880 2018-02-07 18:17:44 Millenials here, thnx. Stocks are okay, not that risky if bought indexed I guess, but the average return is so low it would take half a century to compound a worthwhile capital.
881 2018-02-07 18:17:39 THE WORST DROP IN STOCKS EVER IN THE HISTORY OF STOCK MARKET!!  Isnt that what you wanted to say asshole?!
882 2018-02-07 18:17:38 One of the reasons stocks dropped was because wages are expected to increase. In case you were wondering how our system is working right now. Better wages are seen as a negative for corporations. The more they pay the humans, the less the profits.
883 2018-02-07 18:17:00 You must be blind just look at pay increases gdp stocks and i can go on with more. With obama wages were flst and gdp increase half. Should i aay more
884 2018-02-07 18:16:47 guess stocks didn't like the 10yr auction, yields spike
885 2018-02-07 18:16:27 The Bad news is that Dollar strength is hurting US Stocks.

886 2018-02-07 18:16:26 Stocks off the day's highs. But have still rebounded 1.8% after the recent volatility spike that saw the ^VIX/Fear Index up over 300%, and sent equity indices plummeting, culminating in Monday's -4%+ washout. Many volatility funds and those shorting vol scrambling to stay afloat.

894 2018-02-07 18:13:54 It was very interesting. They understand that cryptocurrencies and blockchain's tech are the future. And that young people have more interest in cryptos  than stocks. So a good understanding od cryptos and regulations are important for the youth.
895 2018-02-07 18:13:43 Yes. Now the Dow Jones and S & P are biased against you. Let me guess - Obama, HRC, & George Soros bought up majority shares in all index stocks so they could sell off when “good news” is announced in order to make you look bad. 
896 2018-02-07 18:13:43 #stocks looking  #terrible !!!
897 2018-02-07 18:12:14 Investors don't get "scared" they sell off stocks and buy bonds because the higher interest rates make them a better choice.
898 2018-02-07 18:11:54 You understand stocks as much as you understand women, climate change, law, ethics,  tie length. ...

905 2018-02-07 18:10:16 Funny how when the stocks dropped to an all time low on Monday Fox stopped running the stock quotes on screen. I bet they were showing them yesterday when the market rebounded. And they wonder why they’re labeled an entertainment station & not actual news.

913 2018-02-07 18:08:38 The good news is the economy is returning to norm and stocks will naturally fall as bonds go up. The Fed did its part with rates. You did your part with deregulation. And Congress did its part with tax reform.
914 2018-02-07 18:08:19 A correction was due. Not a crash. Stocks will fluctuate. Deep state meddling.

919 2018-02-07 18:06:58 Bad for stocks...if you are long on stocks.
..like say for Thurs...Fri...Next week if yield keeps moving up....stocks will fall
920 2018-02-07 18:06:24 Just saying, the "experts" can only relate to stocks of the past. Crypto is a new entity, so know one knows cause there is very little history.

923 2018-02-07 18:05:04 Or maybe, just maybe, the stock market is NOT a proxy for the economy! The truth is that the top 10% own over 80% of all stocks, so they're the primary beneficiaries of a booming stock market, while the <50% of Americans who have 401Ks see only temporary paper gains.

927 2018-02-07 18:03:47 Raising capital via stocks will always be part of a market economy and the quickest way to build wealth in the long run. Cryptocurrency will be the source of funds. In the long run, cryptocurrency will be more medium of exchange and less store of value.

932 2018-02-07 18:02:26 We need to reform everything. We, the Amer. People let the senate and congress get away with way too much. Insider trading is something that reg. people go to jail for. Our law makers have stocks,  sale stocks, change laws, that affect those same stocks.
933 2018-02-07 18:02:25 Today people dont believe in news, as a fact no one demanded stock more than what he have, and the oppressed people remain oppressed at the end no change. that is why stocks market goes down. a fair employment system will impact the stock market.

950 2018-02-07 17:58:06 I really don't like Selling Quality Stocks cos think Market will fall. This is cos I've learnt that when you have Quality Stock the worst thing you can do is Sell it. You must run Winners often for many years. If Sell with hope to buy back later you run up huge Dealing Costs.

953 2018-02-07 17:56:43 I do very little with anything stock related because I have no idea what I'm doing and life is expensive, but I get company stocks. Trying to figure out how to liquidate some and I'm like number 978 in the help queue. Guess it's a bad day to try to talk to stock broker people! 
954 2018-02-07 17:56:12 Obviously a vast conspiracy by the millions and millions of people who buy and sell stock to make you look bad! Selling their stocks at a loss! Wow what did @foxandfriends say about it? They should use their investigation skills to get to the bottom
955 2018-02-07 17:56:00 Bonds no better! Especially treasury bonds! With borrowing to accelerate & national debt to soar bonds no better than stocks! Get rid of conventional thinking if you want to survive in this rapidly unraveling USA!

967 2018-02-07 17:52:21 Mr. Adhia was not right but ur friend is not right either, in last 1 year, many people have gained more then nifty by buying small and mid cap stocks  just by watching business channels and they don't have all those skills
968 2018-02-07 17:51:47 People put too much value in stocks. A strong employment report over the last week led to increased interest rates for debt securities. So investors sold their stock to purchase bonds. Now smaller investors are buying those stocks at the reduced price. The economy is fine.
969 2018-02-07 17:51:46 There's a few stocks like that. Google is another one.
970 2018-02-07 17:51:22 Risk/reward opportunity on bitcoin is arguably much better than stocks (at current stock valuations). Sure, BTC might go to zero, but there is also a decent chance of a 10x or higher.
971 2018-02-07 17:51:20 And while your at it dump all stocks of companies advertising on news networks that are profiting from all the negative news they’re perpetually generating.

981 2018-02-07 17:47:34 When the stock values are down, other parts of the economy thrive.  It's a system of Weights and scales. Wage rates will drop once stocks rise again. That'll be just alerting.

984 2018-02-07 17:46:26 Why you think they imposed quotas ?  Due to the overfishing that was rife in the industry and would eventually have led to the total collapse of the fish stocks. You brexiters are prepared to destroy 40 years of growth associated with our EU membership.  It’s not over yet.
985 2018-02-07 17:46:17 Stock markets plunge is not without meaning?.The stocks overvaluations pushed through several quantitative,stimulus measure in US&EU etc read with other global competitors, their exchange rate issues may put strains on several corporates/ financial institutions debt resolutions?

988 2018-02-07 17:45:17 So then by your theory since the stock market has been going up for over a year we've had a lot of bad news. You are right thought because you're  nothing but bad news. Bring it on liar in chief and keep the stocks rising. Do you even grasp what you write?

1060 2018-02-07 17:30:02 This can never be in doubt. @DanMalloyCT will fight to make CT residents safer by taking on special interests and championing gun violence: now is the time to ban bump-stocks. #CTFairness
1061 2018-02-07 17:29:55 I'm down with that.....kind of wish we still used stocks, personally....then to Gitmo or Leavenworth... I'm not to picky... long as it's a looooooooooong sentence
1062 2018-02-07 17:29:45 Oh yes! Shock therapy.
But that panic short of thing helped me get into some stocks, I was wanting to get enter into since months. That shock therapy didn't let me panic.
1063 2018-02-07 17:29:14 However I prefer gold stocks.
1064 2018-02-07 17:29:04 I bet neither of you even own any stocks, less than 40% of Americans own stocks
1065 2018-02-07 17:28:58 Depends on whether a strong Wall St translates to improved cash flows on Main St. Stocks are up, but so are gas prices. Also, do Dems focus on an uneasy middle of the electorate for the sweeping win, or do they opt for candidates from the far left fringe that alienate the center?
1066 2018-02-07 17:28:48 before you join us bitch you gotta get ya stocks up
1067 2018-02-07 17:28:40 Investopedia could easily explain how naked shorting occurs often with three Market makers. And yes you can short penny stocks. Ask Tim Sykes

1071 2018-02-07 17:27:45 now I see why ppl have a broker to help them with stocks... this is a lot of info... 90% of it, is over my head. 

but I'm still trying to learn. ppl get ripped off for not understanding what they're doing.
1072 2018-02-07 17:27:39 Free advice.

Older people who trade stocks all day telling young people how good they have it...doesn't resonate.
1073 2018-02-07 17:27:38 "U.S. stocks market experiences tremendous increase of volatility.

1079 2018-02-07 17:26:25 India government Bonds are crashing. Not Good for Stocks.
1080 2018-02-07 17:25:51 You can buy parts of a crypto which allows you to participate with very little initial income.
Also cryptos have frankly proven to be a way better investment than stocks.
1081 2018-02-07 17:25:48 In tweet mode today, does it increase stocks. Isn't that ridiculous. The Market is based on actual Input growth.

1084 2018-02-07 17:25:44 According to the "Financial Experts" the computers control the algorithms that have pre-programmed levels to sell the stocks, well who does the programming? Cabal sheeple?
1085 2018-02-07 17:25:27 Amazon is a most valuable brand than Apple? I don't think so.
1086 2018-02-07 17:24:53 Just can’t sit here in silence.   Do whatever you want. But I can point out to ppl to REALLY think about who they give $ too.  It’s an opinion.  I’m allowed to.  I seen ALOT in my 30 yrs trading stocks. Bye
1087 2018-02-07 17:24:39 Hmm...I wonder if rates stopped going up bc stocks were going down and thus became attractive again to bonds on relative basis for the algos. Or the rates stopped going up because ppl worried the falling stock market would hurt the actual economy.
1088 2018-02-07 17:24:38 I'm a pretty conservative investor. So far I've avoid stocks and crypto but bought a lot of foreign currency. If any of those drops, I'd just plan a vacation in Japan, US, or Europe. For me, a currency is only as good as who is willing to accept it as payment

1095 2018-02-07 17:23:00 Stocks must be up today!
1096 2018-02-07 17:22:34 Great. So when I cash in my stocks today I’ll just tell them that 1100 point drop was all just a “big mistake” and they’ll give me all my money back?  Dude, whatrya smokin?
1097 2018-02-07 17:22:01 @CNBCFastMoney @ScottWapnerCNBC  Id ask Lee Cooperman the same question I asked him over dinner last nite.
Are bulls justified in saying stocks are not expensive because of the low level of interest rates - when the same bulls believe that fixed income is greatly overvalued?
1098 2018-02-07 17:21:17 @jimcramer disagree with Trump rally was not a Trump rally. His attitude toward business made buying stocks desirable and the tax cuts reinforced that impression. The problem is in the weeds, in the real economic policy which imo is flawed. Btw the broker talked me into
1099 2018-02-07 17:20:59 Hi Joey. Almost every major news source reports stock numbers every single day on a regular basis. They report when stocks are up and they report when stocks are down. Your personal perception that they didn't cover the stock market before doesn't make that the case.
1100 2018-02-07 17:20:55 Carl Bernstein is one of the great leftist laughing stocks of recent memory! lololol
1101 2018-02-07 17:20:52 You need to get regulators to close 2x and 3x leveraged etf and etn instruments asap! These will destroy our great stock market going forward! Let the speculators short stocks the old fashioned way or go home!
1102 2018-02-07 17:20:19 Please just stop talking about stocks...
1103 2018-02-07 17:19:58 Yes, the stocks made a bad choice to not give the president a standing ovation. They should be punished, the traitors.
1104 2018-02-07 17:19:58 It's because the rich are pumping their money into it. It can only remain high for so long. It is a continuation of what Obama did. At point the stocks will cap. The rich are the only ones that can invest. You know what they say about abt. A fool and his money.

1106 2018-02-07 17:18:41 Nearly everyone is second guessing the *WHY* about the recent volatilty and down move. First of all I don´t care why, second, the why will come at some point as the AHA moment. #markets #trading #stocks #futures
1107 2018-02-07 17:18:24 The index will plummet at some point

It is heavily invested in Facebook, Apple, Alphabet etc..
Just like the people who buy the stocks

They way over valued

When one does a big drop the index will follow.  If a bunch do, the index will plunge.

Few stocks is not an economy
1108 2018-02-07 17:18:22 Other than stocks (which mostly do) all metrics are continuing the same trend line since 2010. It’s Obama’s economy.
1109 2018-02-07 17:18:17 Because there is no mechanism that can turn $1000 into more money. Banks? Bonds? Stocks? Are these new words to you?

1122 2018-02-07 17:14:55 What is the rational behind this? Your investment in more than 100 stocks now comes to less than 10 stocks (guess). Now tell us what was the conviction behind those 90+ stocks (you dropped now) earlier? We are still invested in those stocks based on your conviction? Please guide.

1124 2018-02-07 17:14:37 I made more money on it than from my stocks. It was investing when I bought in in 2016 (had steady growth and it was largely predictable based on the fact that it was not widely known). It became gambling when the masses noticed it, forcing it to follow a market bubble pattern.

1133 2018-02-07 17:11:38 Tax cuts = inflation = interest rates up = stocks  down. Don't you listen to your advisors? And how is the market moving a "mistake"? Ignorance in high office is dangerous!

1142 2018-02-07 17:09:31 What does paying attention to stocks get you? If know nothing about stock markets you can't make an informed decision anyway. Plus you get penalized for taking money out of it. Not everyone has a fucking degree in economics. Lot of people have day 2 day problems, stocks not one.
1143 2018-02-07 17:08:55 Bit hit my 6k target, albeit not for long. Stocks/crypto bottom at the same time. Another theory I hung out there.
1144 2018-02-07 17:08:33 If by “people” you mean the ones that buy and sell stocks I suspect this commentary is irrelevant.

The echo chamber around 3% growth predictions might actually matter given how many CEOs claim to find this number plausible.

1147 2018-02-07 17:07:48 former Fed Chair Janet Yellen said that U.S. stocks are “high,” with P/E ratios near the upper end of their historical ranges. S&P 500 companies trade for nearly 23 times profit, a ratio that has only been matched once since the dot-com bubble. #SellOff #DowJones
1148 2018-02-07 17:07:32 You can dish it out but can't take it.  You claimed it was because of you when the stocks go up.  Start taking the blame then when the go down.  Such as asshat you really are.

Your assumption was fairly accurate.

1162 2018-02-07 17:04:05 Anybody who invests in stocks with more than they can afford to lose deserves to be shot. If you can't make money with your own don't give it to someone else to do it for you.

1168 2018-02-07 17:03:04 Inflation in stocks is not the result of free markets. The markets are managed and manipulated.
1169 2018-02-07 17:03:02 Faster than expected wage growth caused bond yields to spike higher on both the positive economic news and the flicker of inflationary pressures, as well as potentially faster than expected interest rate hikes by the Fed. This bond market behavior led to stocks selling off (2/2)

1183 2018-02-07 17:00:20 I guess they had to adjust to the level of the economy, and now they have, unless they haven’t then stocks will go down or up from here. Helpful?
1184 2018-02-07 17:00:13 $SNAP up 14% from the open and 40% for the day. I only buy stocks when they have turnaround quarters like $SNAP and $TWTR, never short.
1185 2018-02-07 17:00:12 90% of the stock value is held by the top 10% - when stocks go up they feel the thrill, when stocks go down you feel the burn.  Time to move to the country and become self-sufficient
1186 2018-02-07 17:00:10 the bond bear market will feed on itself in 2 years. Significantly higher rates = harder for countries like the U.S. to finance debt. When the next #stocks bear market starts, that will raise sovereign default concerns, which will push rates even higher. It’ll be a vicious cycle

1192 2018-02-07 16:58:44 _/\_. The fall when it will come. No one knows. Since 2008,Govts have pumped money to spur growth and stocks are in historical PEs across the world.
1193 2018-02-07 16:58:42 Inflation in stocks is due to DS bank corruption. 2008 on has seen no bank lending but massive bank infusion in markets. Pulling  up stock prices to record PE spreads. Free markets don’t exist! Silver? Gold? Constitutional law adherence and death of bank system is mandatory.

1235 2018-02-07 16:47:26 Months from now some will still be writing that it's not clear why stocks tumbled in early 2018, some mix of inflation and VIX funds . . . BUT basically stocks went down because rates went up. And stocks stopped going down when interest rates stopped going up. Pretty simple.
1236 2018-02-07 16:47:06 Mixed day for stocks so far. Perhaps settling in for a bit of volatile sideways? TREND STILL DOWN, FULL HEDGES IN PLACE, so keeping the risk under control for now. Enjoy the ride!

1259 2018-02-07 16:41:42 This is an silly statement. The stock market is based upon an innumerable number of factors, not just the reporting of news. If earnings are up, stocks prices go up as a reaction to the earnings, not because of the news reports about the earnings. Geez!

1275 2018-02-07 16:37:03 Here's one more trick: During times when stocks decline by 5 percent or more, increase the amounts you're regularly investing, and after similar market increases, scale back those amounts.

And remember, panic is not your friend.

The point is, volatility is unavoidable in investing. Its latest appearance, in my view, isn't another financial crisis.
1294 2018-02-07 16:34:43 Hate to tell you, but the Stock Market has ALWAYS acted this way. Wages go up, unemployment goes down, Stock Market goes down. Consumers buy more, stocks go down. In other words, what's good for the average American is bad for companies.
1295 2018-02-07 16:34:40 Wrong? You do things, stocks go down? That's what policy does if it's wrong? You can't blame the economics, just policy.

1299 2018-02-07 16:33:42 percent. Those losses had wiped out stocks' gains since the beginning of 2018.

The natural reaction for inexperienced investors is to panic. This fear leads to selling and reduced stock allocations, but that may prove to be a money-losing strategy over the long term.

1313 2018-02-07 16:29:00 Oh, poor lil don... the stocks are being so mean to you. Come on, we know you are trying to distract from the Russia Trump investigation. No one could really be this silly.

1315 2018-02-07 16:28:32 Journalists have been investing in clickbait Millennial headlines for years. Higher return than stocks or crypto.
1316 2018-02-07 16:28:15 In the “old days” stocks always reacted in a totally predictable manner.....
1317 2018-02-07 16:28:13 In other news, gold is falling, the dollar is gaining, and stocks are rebounding
1318 2018-02-07 16:28:08 @business That would depend on TA and FA of the stocks of course.
1319 2018-02-07 16:27:52 Random Chakri Stocks. Ha ha ha so funny :)

1321 2018-02-07 16:27:01 I'll bet there were some who were out of the market during the big run up in stocks, then suddenly got in recently because they didn't want to miss out only to have the market tank. They probably sold & now are missing the rebound. Lesson: don't time the market :) #MarketWatch
1322 2018-02-07 16:26:54 Q to 3rd party administrator: please confirm whether the members benefits contributes to Annual Allowance in tax years X, Y and Z. 

A: they weren't a member in those tax years.

Erm, that's not what I asked. Another letter sent.
1323 2018-02-07 16:26:54 I thought I knew nothing about the stock market until my one friend that works with stocks told me he wanted the DOW to go down a lot, and now I can definitely say: I know absolutely nothing about the stock market.
1324 2018-02-07 16:26:53 Hey you! 
Yeah you! 

A woke young adult like yourself should have investments! Yeah! Check this out, you can give Corporations That You’ve Heard Of all your loose change! 

Stocks are up, BUY NOW so you can cash out!
1325 2018-02-07 16:26:46 Buy bank stocks 
1326 2018-02-07 16:26:26 Smart. I buckled man. Sold at 50% loss. Lost so much confidence when IG stories started. Was around the same time blockchain stocks dropped and needed the US money to purchase, hence the selling.
1327 2018-02-07 16:26:01 I do NOT believe that a president causes stock prices to move in either direction, but if someone claims that a president does affect stocks, then Trump's "effect" is slightly better than Obama's.
1328 2018-02-07 16:25:47 Indefensible! Millennials "Poked" Our Blue Chip Stocks !!
1329 2018-02-07 16:25:42 Stocks up another 1%. Did I come through for you or what.
1330 2018-02-07 16:25:41 Explain him that stocks are at record highs because they anticipated a stellar economy. Now economy is average and markets (sooner or later, faster or slower) will have to normalize.

1334 2018-02-07 16:24:52 I believe the equity markets are completely dependent on extremely low bond rates. Stocks have been priced to perfection with very little room for error. Rates may never normalize again without causing a crash in equities.
1335 2018-02-07 16:24:45 Its all supply and demand. If the coin platform is not successful there will be no interest in a given coin and price will head to zero. Coin prices r determined by the market so in terms of price mechanism they r like stocks

1339 2018-02-07 16:24:23 A lot of I/V drain? I see some stocks' price goes up but option is down.
1340 2018-02-07 16:23:51 Heroin stocks tick higher on the news.
1341 2018-02-07 16:23:42 Early in an economic expansion, good news means economic recovery so good news=good news & stocks respond positively. Late in expansion, good news can lead 2 interest rate hikes so good news=bad news and stocks go down. Whoops! Sorry! Didn't mean to lecture! You went to Wharton.
1342 2018-02-07 16:23:24 Depends on how you look at it.  Some say consumer confidence others say thanks Obama.  He is right that typically hoods news in regards to our economy stocks go up.
1343 2018-02-07 16:22:39 Good news is you will get impeached moron. Stocks will soar  like they did under Obama.

Confused by this one, for sure.
1348 2018-02-07 16:20:18 You are such an idiot. Full employment causes wages to rise (that is inflation) which means interest rates go up. Both bad for stocks.
1349 2018-02-07 16:20:04 Is it the middle of the day? Yes. Do I still know rage because you woke me up by talking too loud about stocks? Yes.
1350 2018-02-07 16:20:04 It only happens with really contrasty stock like Rollei Retro. I tested them for a while and they‘re quite a headache to print. With my usual stocks I don‘t have such issues.

1354 2018-02-07 16:18:55 Daniel Kahneman:
“If owning stocks is a long-term project for you, following their changes constantly is a very, very bad idea. It’s the worst possible thing you can do, because people are so sensitive to short-term losses. If you count your money every day, you’ll be miserable.”
1355 2018-02-07 16:18:53 “Stocks dont top, they double/triple/quad top.” 

Always in the back of my mind for intraday. Useful for any timeframe.
1356 2018-02-07 16:18:29 Perhaps the stock market rally had something to do with the ease monetary policy and now that is being reverted the stocks would suffer?

1363 2018-02-07 16:16:46 Ouch. Remember to always buy on supports and sell on the way up. I personally think $PDXP will test your entry point soon so then you can determine for yourself what is your best play. Penny stocks are not investment they are trades.

1365 2018-02-07 16:16:03 Yup rightfully when yield starts coming down, it makes stocks valuation relatively attractive.. But actual buying din happened probably because of the VIX implosion... looking at the chart if yield recovers.. It probably hurt stocks again ..

1369 2018-02-07 16:15:02 "When good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake." Do you think the stock market is alive? With a mind of it's own? IT decides which way it will go? Clueless. Correction OR gov bond interest rate is going up to pay bills bec of your TAX CUTS. Stocks go DOWN.

1376 2018-02-07 16:14:19 Trump doesn’t talk stocks when he talks stocks. He’s talks “I’m wonderful — the market knows it.” Now he’s doing “I’m wonderful — dummy market out of touch.” He talks “wonderful Trump” to that 48% with no market interest.

1384 2018-02-07 16:12:47 Dear Donald

Fast growth leads to inflation fears.

Revenue loss (tax cut) without cut in spending puts further upward pressure on rates.

Inflation fears lead to depreciation in the bond market.

The bond market dwarfs the stock market. 

The way bonds go, stocks will follow.
1385 2018-02-07 16:12:37 In the details of petroleum stocks, commercial stocks rose 1.9Mb, the SPR by 0.5Mb and overall stocks rose by 4.9Mb on the week.

1389 2018-02-07 16:12:10 You are an idiot.   "Big mistake"?  You don't seem to understand that the stock market isn't a person.  Is the aggregate of all owners of stocks.  Market forces determine the price.... why am I even bothering?
1390 2018-02-07 16:12:07 Jim.. Nearing retirement and thinking of stocks that are affordable to start.  MBRX, do you have any suggestions
1391 2018-02-07 16:12:04 The Art of the Economics by Donald Trump:
You grab the Kudos when to stocks are high
You pass the blame when stocks are low
1392 2018-02-07 16:11:55 You're implying people are selling their stocks because they don't like "good news." I thought you were supposed to be a businessman. You obviously know nothing about how things work in the real world.
1393 2018-02-07 16:11:55 Fully agree. Unless someone is able to time the market.And I haven't yet met or read about 'that some one' who is able to time the market for entry and exit! So the key criteria becomes 'type of stocks you remain invested in'; That will determine ones wealth creation or erosion!

1457 2018-02-07 15:57:55 The stock market and the economy do not represent one another. Never have, never will...Just because a company is doing well, doesn't mean their stocks will rise. Stock prices are determined by stock buyers, not success.

1459 2018-02-07 15:57:38 The stock market only reflects what the algorithms that are used to buy and sell stocks “think” about the news. People aren’t involved very much. You might want to learn more.
1460 2018-02-07 15:57:33 You are not an economist and by your own account, not and expert on stocks and the market, yet you think it is ok to opine about the nature of the market.  Investing requires study, a rising market is not guaranteed, on the contrary corrections happen, stay quiet!!!

1466 2018-02-07 15:55:26 The reason they are the "new" generation of traders who think this way is because the last generation of traders who thought that profits should be instant lost all their money. 

Millennial traders aren't all that different from the Boomers chasing tech stocks in 1999.

1475 2018-02-07 15:53:17 Invest in stocks for the long run: $1 invested in U.S. stocks in 1926 would be worth ~ $6,000 (for U.S. large-co. stocks) and $20,000 (for U.S. small-co. stocks) today. Leave your money invested through good times and bad... (source: Alice Finn, "Smart Women Love Money.")

1482 2018-02-07 15:52:26 Agree with social stability/broad based economic prosperity. But what causes prosperity? Innovation, increasing levels of capital stocks & increases in productivity. If you build a firewall then perhaps the biggest financial innovation to date, tomorrow's prosperity is affected.

1485 2018-02-07 15:52:00 @realDonaldTrump you are a fucking idiot. You don’t know s*** about stocks.
1486 2018-02-07 15:51:54 I have some cash. But I am looking for a little more discount to buy several of my prospective stocks.
1487 2018-02-07 15:51:48 Also, stocks WILL go up due to the corporate tax relief.  But ask yourself if that's a good thing.  Do you wish for something good (high stock market) when the result is something far worse (increased deficit)?  Or is it just Trump! Trump! Trump! no matter how bad things are?

1491 2018-02-07 15:50:39 Market is running off of interest rates. when interest is low, stocks will grow, when interest is high, stocks will die.  MAGA POTUS.
1492 2018-02-07 15:50:32 I have bought CERA at 9, Swaraj Engines at 10, Voltas at 13x and LIC housing at 8 . It is just last 3 years Markets are pricing growth stocks very highly. Later they come in teens too. Also Maurti was 14x in 2013. Didn’t buy though
1493 2018-02-07 15:50:28 I got $5 extra in my paycheck.  Wow! Guess I should go buy some stocks, take the wife out to dinner, buy some new furniture, and go car shopping.

1494 2018-02-07 15:50:26 Audit the Federal Reserve! Janet Yellen did a nice job of talking down stocks, real estate on her way out the door. Let’s see what’s going on over there. Administrations come and go but this thing just sits there doing what for America?

1499 2018-02-07 15:49:46 How to capitalize on next bullish wave

1. Compile growth stocks trading within 25% of 52 Week High
2. Let Nifty50 make double bottom
3. Buy on close above 22 day high with good vol
4. Look for sell signs on divergence with 52Week High-Low

My key lessons from Dec-Jan trading
1500 2018-02-07 15:49:01 Hear that bell ringing..That’s the Stock Market saying: “I’m not a real person, I’m a Market that deals in stocks, you idiot”
1501 2018-02-07 15:48:59 You Macron will have answer all the investors across earth, when the stocks and shares take a hit. You knew of the device to eliminate petrol costs, electrical costs and eradication of Nuclear power. A daft leader you turned out to be, you ignored that choice when you had proof.
1502 2018-02-07 15:48:49 $SNAP wow sold way too early it can’t stop
1503 2018-02-07 15:48:38 We all wondered how you would deal with the reality of the Stock Market. Stocks going up? It’s all you. Stocks going down? Big Mistake.
1504 2018-02-07 15:48:26 Blah blah blah! Economy isn't great right now for everyone that is the real news. Stocks are plummeting because something bad is about to happen.
1505 2018-02-07 15:48:03 I think US production surprises to the upside, Russia/Iran/Iraq exit the deal mid year and stocks begin to build again. What’s your view?
1506 2018-02-07 15:47:53 Now you’re threatening the stock market when it doesn’t do as you say? Sir, stocks don’t answer to you. (Oh...neither does the AG or DOJ.)
1507 2018-02-07 15:47:51 It's easy to earn long term profits by following conventional demand-supply laws while the markets often follow the Giffen Goods law

#markets #investing #cryptocurrencies #stocks #finance
1508 2018-02-07 15:47:51 Try telling the truth. It’s actually better than lying and trying to manipulate others. Or maybe you failed macroeconomics? Tax cuts and deficit spending fuel inflation and raise interest rates. That reduces demand and price of stocks which are very high by historical standards.
1509 2018-02-07 15:47:46 Besides the complete lack of understanding of equity markets the problem are inexperienced people who may take this and put money into stocks without understanding the underlying risks.
1510 2018-02-07 15:47:28 I really think the drop was a result of the Fed dumping tens of billions of crappy debt and stocks on the market. More to come in higher quantities!

1521 2018-02-07 15:45:31 Most of the stock held by billionaires! Not ordinary Americans. Most ordinary Americans own stock only thru their 401k. Many Americans do not even have money to invest in 401K. Stock market an elitist game. I have stocks bc I am thrifty! For no other reason!

1523 2018-02-07 15:45:29 There's a lot less dispersion in today's market. About 350 stocks in the S&P 500 are within 1% of the market's move.
1524 2018-02-07 15:45:15 There will always be good time in market to find and buy stocks. Today, tomorrow, after a year, after 5 years & so on...
Therefore, don't be greedy as if world is going to end tomorrow. This is enlightenment to improve one's patience.

1529 2018-02-07 15:44:09 Just ask the traders in the market to pay more for stocks. It's OK, though. Even stable geniuses miss the obvious, sometimes.
1530 2018-02-07 15:44:05 Markets do not give profits easily, and are quick to take them back. It helps to pause after a good run; back tomorrow.   #stocks #stockmarket #trading #market #investment #business

1542 2018-02-07 15:40:56 I'm not convince the volatility is over, but damn, people, stop panicking over a few crazy days on Wall Street. If you can't handle that kind of thing, don't buy stocks.
1543 2018-02-07 15:40:45 Keep hitting them on this. They are making healthcare costs go up and giving us a few extra bucks while giving millions of dollars to corporations who are just going to buy back stocks or sit in their profits!
1544 2018-02-07 15:40:45 It's just a temporary slump the stocks can't go up constantly they have to call back down at some point. It's not like they are bad enough to hurt the economy plus they are going back up again akreasy.

1569 2018-02-07 15:36:29 1st of all this tweet of your makes NO sense! 2nd of all your actually blaming "good news" for the drop in the stock market. Your so illiterate! Stocks go up and then they fall a bite. ITS CALLED A CORRECTION! It has NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU!
1570 2018-02-07 15:36:29 @cnnbrk Do you take credit for 2/5?  "It was the scariest day on Wall Street in years.
Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading day."
1571 2018-02-07 15:36:22 Lots of accumulation on $GSUM
1572 2018-02-07 15:36:22 Central Banks attempted to corner ALL risk by controlling the baseline against which it was valued.

1582 2018-02-07 15:35:17 So when the market when’s up (and you took credit for it) you were still whining that they only printed ‘bad news’. So how does that work? Bad News=Low Stocks, Bad News=High Stocks? You cannot have it both ways.
1583 2018-02-07 15:35:10 POTUS and journalists need to learn that stocks lead the news on the economy. The S&P 500 is part of the LEI for good reason.

1587 2018-02-07 15:34:43 A great leader takes credit, not only when times (stocks) are good, but also when they're bad. You seem to always blame everyone else but yourself when bad things happen, and you never give credit to the people other than yourself when good things happen.

1613 2018-02-07 15:31:40 The stock market goes down because the good news boosts the chances of a more aggressive Federal Reserve to prevent the economy from overheating, raising bond yields & making stocks less attractive.

1635 2018-02-07 15:29:39 Hey Matthew, do you think it’s too late to buy Tesla stocks?
1636 2018-02-07 15:29:39 someone with no finance skills thinks good news means stocks go up.  He's old enough to remember inflation (rich enough it didn't really effect him) so a booming economy isn't always good.
1637 2018-02-07 15:29:34 the stocks did it on purpose
1638 2018-02-07 15:29:29 When the tax reduction hits Corporate profit statements earnings per share will go out the roof and stocks will skyrocket.

1640 2018-02-07 15:29:14 OMG! He is an idiot about how the stock market works too?  If the economy overheats and inflation sets in, the herd moves away from stocks into bonds.
1641 2018-02-07 15:29:13 "Our bullish investment thesis on cryptos is based on strong fundamentals fuelled by millennials finding stocks expensive and therefore seeking alternative made-up assets to pile into through Reddit"
1642 2018-02-07 15:28:39 Everything is fine.  If everyone were smart, they'd buy a bunch of stocks and the Dow Jones would tell us so.
1643 2018-02-07 15:28:36 There's a reason for that: when economy is doing badly the FED gives money to .01% who run stocks higher but when economy is doing well the FED stops that (as requested by Congress) so .01% sell their stocks & wait till market crash to prompt corp welfare again & run stocks
1644 2018-02-07 15:28:24 Not to worry. Slow and steady wins the race. We did great the last during Obama because the growth was genuine. These spikes painted a false picture and stocks were overvalued. We'll be ok. Good time to buy.
1645 2018-02-07 15:28:05 1) I like this interpretation, thankyouvery much. Come at me. 2) Up Stocks, why the condescension? Maybe less study of Vilna Gaon, more Chofetz Chaim.

1647 2018-02-07 15:27:45 Have you tried stocks too? :)
1648 2018-02-07 15:27:41 Probably because for the average man trading fees, exhcange fees etc are a burden.  Its also more difficult to pick stocks from a huge contingent of companies.  Picking from a few hundred promising coins is much easier.

1655 2018-02-07 15:25:29 The stock market rise has not been due to a good economy but rather low interest rates allowing companies to issue low interest bonds to buy back their stocks. Stock buy back props up their earnings per share because there are fewer shares. They'll come back in a good economy.

Donald Trump just tweeted about the stock market.
That's not true at all. There were many years when stocks rose on bad news because it meant stimulus …
1665 2018-02-07 15:23:55 I've seen people say that more inflationary pressure might not support the continuation of a fairly rapid acceleration in stocks, which seems like the steelmanned and not unreasonable version.
1666 2018-02-07 15:23:44 That's possible papa, just like $RIBS is doing right now that you posted, Nice call on that one.
