39 2018-11-26 22:21:52 Remind me to tell you why real estate isn't like other commodities (hint: it's because location is a natural monopoly of which the supply is fixed, and is effectively priced via the Law of Rent instead of Supply and Demand)

49 2018-11-26 21:59:53 good. if you trade ES since 10Y (2008), at least you experienced FED QE1-3, total distortion of short and long term rates, money supply, US$ manipulation, therefore commodities and stocks distortion, as well as credit spreads distortion. FED game stopped and slowly shows up now
50 2018-11-26 21:49:25 Public are increasingly sceptical of our 'superiors' ie media,politicians,NGOs,landlords.. They're realising that refugees are commodities to make money from .   wait till the next economic bust

52 2018-11-26 21:45:17 Agree that it would be great to sell ships. Same rules as trading precious commodities; higher profits if you find the certain systems & trading posts. Please @NoMansSky
53 2018-11-26 21:42:51 It's a variation on Marx's M-C-M' (money used to buy commodities to be sold for more money). P-W-P' is the state using its people (workforce) to acquire wealth, which in turn attracts more people

56 2018-11-26 21:31:50 Also, the CFO said the tax cuts were a net positive in the long term b/c of the assumption Trump would give up this stupid trade war.  As far as GM vs Ford... GM produced 52 cars per employee vs 36 for Ford.  Both companies are laying off due to commodities. Guess the both suck?
57 2018-11-26 21:26:45 Hahahaha I F'ing love this market. Everything has went too junk. Tech, Commodities, industrials, financials.  Keeper comin' boys!
58 2018-11-26 21:20:24 You are showing to the world that the U.K. Is prepared to treat people as mere commodities - to be used and discarded. There is no honour in this approach. If I was a highly-skilled native of a different country, I'd choose to work in a country with more decency. You shame us.
59 2018-11-26 21:11:49 #Crudeoil was up more than 2% on Monday after Friday’s 8% rout after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said current prices were an “extremely attractive entry point for longs in oil” and other commodities.
60 2018-11-26 21:06:38 Bajo esa lógica tampoco les agradan las políticas de derecha en Brasil ya que el real se ha depreciado 3% hoy. O tal vez tenga que ver con la caída de los precios de los commodities... Sería bueno dar contexto antes de tratar de confirmar las creencias que se tienen...
61 2018-11-26 21:05:34 Sorry, it doesn't say any such thing. Dignity is not virginity. You should try giving some respect to ladies instead of considering them as commodities that you can reject or accept. That's totally against Islam. They are not your property even if they are married to you!!!

67 2018-11-26 20:46:57 O PMDB introduziu ilegalmente a soja transgênica no RS. Lula aprovou descumprindo as promessas de campanha, e apesar dos alertas contrários. As nossas commodities agrícolas, se livres de transgênicos, agregariam alto valor comercial. Só queria saber quanto Lula ganhou da Monsanto

70 2018-11-26 20:30:12 Would be intersting to look at why education and income affects choice of religious commodities
71 2018-11-26 20:30:09 #IronOre quickly catching up to other commodities. It had a nice lag though allowing time to get out of names like $mgx
72 2018-11-26 20:30:02 Canada should get an assurance that the tariffs on steel and aluminum end or NO FREE TRADE DEAL!!! Then we can start charging the US the market price for our commodities like oil and water.
73 2018-11-26 20:24:23 Education is one of the most profitable & valued commodities of all. It produces what's known as "human capital."

I find it odd that you think certain types of jobs aren't paid enough. 

Before condemning a thing, you should learn as much about it as you can.

82 2018-11-26 19:33:52 The one thing about living in Iowa, the farm report. The latest? Oh! So bad. All commodities are down again. We’ve tried to spread the word of presale and conservation farming. They don’t want to change. We can’t help stupid and neither should our taxes.
83 2018-11-26 19:32:49 É uma boa pergunta de fato. Mas a China continua consumindo commodities tanto agrícolas quanto minerais para consumo interno. quando penso em mundo desacelerando penso em EUA e Europa. Enquanto o BR exportar soja e carne (e a China abrir mais ainda para isto), teremos superávit.

87 2018-11-26 19:27:55 I think that Blade and Ghost Rider are somewhat known commodities, and if Doctor Strange is a major character, he can probably provide the context for bringing in the other characters. Solos could help, but with the right script, they might not be necessary.

89 2018-11-26 19:22:15 Someone asked, "how does an artist get into museums and galleries?" 
This trivial question has a complex response. A select few artists will have success while alive. Those that do often become commodities. Sometimes their names are more important than the work they make.
90 2018-11-26 19:21:58 Se reactivo el comercio internacional entre las potencias que se interrumpió durante la guerra. Y aparecieron varios países que producían los mismo commodities que nosotros.

92 2018-11-26 19:09:32 this argument is similar to the argument that cloud computing - which means servers become white box commodities built by the million and stripped bare of software features, would have killed Dell, HP, EMC. They had to adapt but they are ok.
93 2018-11-26 19:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.

95 2018-11-26 19:04:20 US dollar versus other currencies or commodities is how you create hedge funds.  Soros donated $10 Million to Hillary’s 2016 campaign via through Super PACs.  Based on the way he makes money, Did he want her to help the country fail?

98 2018-11-26 19:00:49 This is the first traces of the class system and private property. People are sold and bought as commodities and used as either laborers, domestic or sexual servants. Those who are used as laborers are often sent to work on their master’s farms...

105 2018-11-26 18:32:45 For commodities specifically it allows producers the ability to lock-in prices years in advance through futures contracts. For cryptocurrency, especially bitcoin, I could see a futures vehicle for unmined coins.

109 2018-11-26 18:27:09 The Fed may look at wages, commodities and consumer prices and conclude that they can go slower in hiking rates. The data is suggesting we could be looking at fewer Fed hikes in FY19 – and a far longer cycle than any of us could imagine.

114 2018-11-26 18:17:35 Dólar dispara com cautela de investidores em relação a países emergentes, que podem sofre mais os efeitos da guerra comercial, queda do crescimento global e dos preços de commodities, como petróleo e minério. Dólar sobe 2,27% a R$ 3,91. Bolsa cai 1,48%.
115 2018-11-26 18:14:33 How can people think of Congress it has done nothing except favoring casteism in 60 years on the contrary Bjp has done a lot it creates  unity among people. awareness of corruption. controlled price for essential commodities.
116 2018-11-26 18:09:00 Companies like GM would have supplier arrangements on commodities decades into the future. Those tariffs might have impacted small suppliers to GM but that would be on the periphery of their business.
117 2018-11-26 18:06:23 Oh what a good question to the PM, and what a rubbish reply: 1) we are not commodities - we are people, 2) people aren't static (I came over as a young person, not as a ready-made 'skilled contributor' but developed a career & now co-own a business that employs Brits!).
118 2018-11-26 18:04:09 No basis with 2 completely unknown commodities (as far as fighting is concerned). Nothing more than a feeling bro. And with all due respect, I typically discredit anyone who just randomly suggests "I'd beat the hell outta (insert name)"
119 2018-11-26 18:00:42 'Free Movement' is of CAPITAL, LABOUR, GOODS and SERVICES. No mention of PEOPLE. This is because workers are views as COMMODITIES in the EU Empire. In Neo-Liberal 'FREE Market' practices. #Brexit
120 2018-11-26 18:00:24 Thousands have lost jobs for many many years and we have seen some companies go into administration even whilst in EU.

149 2018-11-26 16:09:30 I bought physical, and yes I'm still holding, and occasionally purchasing to lower my cost average. I still love precious metals, and believe value is there. 

My point.. all commodities go up and down.  It's a natural (and sometimes manipulated) cycle that none are exempt from.
150 2018-11-26 16:06:27 I’m not talking tax cuts I’m talking wages everything went up in cost because of eco fees to all form of taxes. Since gas went to $1.28 a litre a can of tuna now cost almost $4.00 price did not come down liter of gas now under a dollar. Cost of hydro brought all commodities up.

238 2018-11-26 10:34:04 Any widely held consensus view, as you suggest, is likely to run into trouble. If its obvious with commodities, which $GS actually thinks, then imo its obviously wrong
239 2018-11-26 10:32:36 Agree Absolutely never blindly fade...but on big themes like pounding the table for EM in the spring...$gs crushes their clients imo deliberately - commodities are another big theme & $gs clearly does not understand the dollar imo
240 2018-11-26 10:31:21 So far, all I read from brokers as 2019 Outlook is the same I read last year as 2018 Outlook:

- Dollar weakness
- EM strength
- Prefer EU to US
- Commodities rise

Seems brokers still live the QE mirage

242 2018-11-26 10:16:04 I believe you acknowledge that the state (apartheid) used SA assets; institutional, human, commodities et al to benefit one race. Can this be undone organically (what I assume you are preaching) or through another state intervention? Your response would certainly clarify a lot...

249 2018-11-26 09:41:11 GS hoje sobre commodities para 2019 :

we believe commodities offer an extremely attractive entry point for longs in oil, gold and base. The G20 meeting could be a catalyst for a rebound as the China/US relationship and an OPEC+ cut will be discussed.
250 2018-11-26 09:36:59 Commodities soar, dollar sinks, inflation rises, Fed keeps tightening...and equities???
251 2018-11-26 09:27:24 O Brasil na era Lula não dependia do exterior? Então você não sabe o papel que a China e a compra de commodities tiveram no nosso crescimento econômico até 2014 ano em que a crise começou a aparecer.
252 2018-11-26 09:15:06 Point understood but how then should we keep on forcefully pairing the USD equal to the Bond note. Is requesting duty on imported commodities in USD addressing the fundamentals? And does the government have any money in foreign currency in its coffers as we speak?
253 2018-11-26 09:12:43 Lobola brings “hupfumi” mumusha. Mombe mudanga kind of scenario, no one in Zimbabwe is ready to pass on that. Daughters are valued commodities under lobola!
254 2018-11-26 09:11:11 respected as sentient individuals, rather than commodities or egg production units, I wouldn't lose sleep over someone eating the eggs, provided the hens are unharmed.

255 2018-11-26 09:05:27 Meanwhile I'm in full defensive mode if I take my kids to Walmart and neither has seen so much as a picket line in person. There's a women and children as commodities aspect to this that angers me.

261 2018-11-26 08:33:28 Doesn’t make it a security. Commodities have to be brought too as do utilities.
262 2018-11-26 08:31:49 Sad thing is other charities & orgs have to compete with this type of conglomerate are also seeing people in the workforce & service users as commodities. I’m horrified by the targets & the way they are written on whiteboards as if it’s a salesroom not a community service. 
263 2018-11-26 08:28:30 @AlanKohler can you show the outright prices for commodities and not just the percentage change? I don’t watch your segment every night and so the irregular percentage changes tell me nothing, except volatility (or lack thereof!) many thanks

4. Commodities
279 2018-11-26 06:50:19 To control the currency crisis in Yemen is to resume hydrocarbon production and exports, mobilize sufficient external support to cover imports of basic commodities and fuel at an official exchange rate, and overcome the division in the monetary authority in the country.

284 2018-11-26 06:04:53 “Progressive views” from fossil fuel industry? Like “Cap & Trade”, which will just give you all another toy to play with at the stock market? (Carbón commodities).

296 2018-11-26 04:04:30 Totally agree.  Buuuut, the Arts & Crafts Committee sounds kinda fun.
We need a less fun committee? 
How about the 'United States House Agriculture Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities and Risk Management'?  That sounds boring as hell.
297 2018-11-26 04:00:18 Big fax. Yeah, regulatory oversight in commodities is a meme.
298 2018-11-26 03:58:42 I would guess that the salary may be scaled to such effect, but since commodities can be priced very differently we would also need to understand wider market factors before reaching a conclusion. In addition we don't know how the govt and economic systems work. Food subsidies?
299 2018-11-26 03:57:16 “The Victorian Government through its legalisation of prostitution has facilitated the creation of a prostitution culture which normalises the view that there exists a class of women who exist for men’s use & for their sexual gratification, commodities that can be bought & sold.

315 2018-11-26 02:24:47 It would be the epitome of foolishness for the Government of the United States to give up its constitutional monopoly over money creation to Bitcoin miners or any other creators or discoverers of artificially or naturally occurring commodities by making them state currencies.
316 2018-11-26 02:21:45 Agreed that it looks bad and anyone of ethical clothe would distance themselves from companies (or not hypocritically golf so much), but not sure since he isn’t in commodities and his policies don’t immediate affect golf resort values that he can get pinned on it.

336 2018-11-26 00:29:05 Que cuando se acaba la plata de los commodities de exportación, se dan cuenta que hay plata en las AFJP (que ya se habían robado como mínimo el 30% de los aportes). Donde los que aprobaron la privatización se desgarran las vestiduras para nacionalizar lo privatizado.

341 2018-11-26 00:08:27 Think closing the border is a good idea?
