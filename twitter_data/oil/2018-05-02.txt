39 2018-05-02 23:57:23 And I agree in directional movement.  Getting off foreign oil and pulling out of foreign wars is a great boon for the environment.  Producing local energy is better than shipping it.  I agree coal isn't an end point but it IS directional improvement.

43 2018-05-02 23:56:12 learning today if the hydrogen fluoride tank at the oil refinery that blew up next to our office ignited it would have made a vapor cloud that would have basically melted people it came in contact with is extremely safe and normal feeling

48 2018-05-02 23:55:22 I'd be surprised if this thing gets built but I think it's important that  & Trump get the message that we don't have to pump all that oil to stateside refineries under NAFTA. That being said, let's consult, sign fair agreements, follow the process & see what happens.
49 2018-05-02 23:55:22 Not to be a triggered little snowflake, but I think it's time we think about changing the name of what we call "rapeseed oil." "Cosby oil" seems like a good fit.

54 2018-05-02 23:54:35 MGHHHHGH BUT AN OIL CLEANSER IS ONLY GOOD AS A PRELIMINARY STEP BEFORE A WATER CLEANSER AAAAAAAAAAA
55 2018-05-02 23:54:21 And that oil needs to both a) keep flowing, and b) not become dominated by one or more hostile foreign powers, leaving those who own it free to sell it for others to buy at a fair market price, which is what the US does. We never stole a thing.

58 2018-05-02 23:54:13 FYI, the main reason that Russia got involved so deeply was the threat of oil and gas pipelines from Qatar passing through Syria to Europe if Assad lost territory. Oil is vital to the Russian economy, for the US it's just another commodity that cares about global supply security

147 2018-05-02 23:42:15 His firing has nothing to do with religion he’s in the pocket of big oil and has been there for a long time. The corruption in our government starts with the funding of these campaigns on both sides. It’s not exclusive to the Republican Party.
148 2018-05-02 23:41:54 I shaved AND put on coconut oil  I feel like a brand new woman
149 2018-05-02 23:41:41 Because nothing says great media like overt pandering.
150 2018-05-02 23:41:38 It will spurn innovation, just as high oil prices created incentives to invest in shale and new energy technologies that have made the US oil independent- a huge shift within a little more than a decade, with geopolitical ramifications.
151 2018-05-02 23:41:31 NAGISA HAS TO PUT SUNCREEN OIL ON REI IN THIS MOVIE ARE YOU KIDDING ME
152 2018-05-02 23:41:27 And theirs one simple reason why.... Liberalism is evil. It has no standards and doesn't care who gets hurt along the way as long as the end justifies the means.
153 2018-05-02 23:41:27 Interesting, only people saying Kinder Morgan has support of Indigenous peoples seem to be non-IP oil lobbyists& politicians? #KinderMorgan
154 2018-05-02 23:41:26 Olive oil and MAC Volcanic Ash Exfoliator.
155 2018-05-02 23:41:06 They cannot make it obvious so they have to charge everyone. Time to invest in oil companies if you already have not. Trudeau is to blame for all of these prices and needs to go.
156 2018-05-02 23:41:03 I bought my beaux an oil diffuser for his office and he’ll be leaving my house with his choice of oil blends custom tailored to his needs and likes.
157 2018-05-02 23:40:46 Well we’re frackking the last of the oil out of the ground, & trying to export it, While we burn ethanol in our cars. Our energy policy is totally screwed up, and we’re working toward the last efficient cars. Maybe we can make some that burn “clean coal”
158 2018-05-02 23:40:41 Dawg I got yelled at for using lotion that wasn’t mine but somehow my coconut oil levels been dwindling daily & it ain’t me using it

162 2018-05-02 23:40:31 Thanks to @JustinTrudeau, @cathmckenna, and Canada for taking action on oil & gas climate pollution, while President Trump tries (and fails) to drag the US backward. Reducing methane emissions from oil & gas at no net cost is a win for us all. @EDFaction
163 2018-05-02 23:40:29 Just curious Darcy, any idea if the GP are even remotely similar between the two? Just don't get good ol' Pete...

165 2018-05-02 23:40:08 The oil sands and associated pipelines represent one of the worst creators of greenhouse gas and contaminated water and soil. The potential for an environmental disaster, due to pipeline failure is very real.
166 2018-05-02 23:40:06 Wealthy Play All Sides: Why is our Military being used as gangsters for the last 16 yrs in these Genocides Wars for Land, Oil, GoldEU is the power in the RegionSaudis attacked US not Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Lebanon, Niger, Somalia, Iran, etc.
167 2018-05-02 23:40:02 And use coconut oil to remove makeup. It works wonders and makes your face so soft.

171 2018-05-02 23:39:10 @Walmart tell me why you guys don’t have seating near the auto section when I’m getting an oil change I’m an old lady and need a chair
172 2018-05-02 23:39:06 If Medicare health program was an oil platform, or a coal mine or a huge steel mill or a weapon manufaturer, certainly, the problem would have been resolved.
173 2018-05-02 23:39:00 They've been disadvantaged. Oil recession took over. Jason Kenney never balanced a budget when he was with the CPC's, either.
174 2018-05-02 23:38:49 Okies, 6 garlic cloves smashed in an elevated saucepan, brown in EVOO, then add a can of crushed tomatoes with salt and pepper to taste, cook on medium for 10 minutes or until the sauce thickens, add more EVOO and cook medium low till oil is red. Add basil at the end!!!
175 2018-05-02 23:38:38 This seems better for the environment than Ryan Zinke/Lamar Alexander's plan to drill baby drill, but isn't there a bipartisan way that doesn't involve oil/gas/coal at all?

176 2018-05-02 23:38:32 No one. I'm a small business owner in a field that has nothing to do with oil or environmentalism.  I simply respect facts & truth.  Here's a fact for you:  The maximum amount of oil Canada has ever exported by rail is 6%.  It's currently around 4%. Pipe vs. rail talk= deception.

Nothing more than petty sniping. Bigger things are happening.
180 2018-05-02 23:37:43 Yeah they use peanut oil
181 2018-05-02 23:37:30 I'm suprised you haven't invaded Alberta for it's oil yet.
182 2018-05-02 23:37:29 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
183 2018-05-02 23:37:28 It was the R's who twice sold us a war for oil on false pretenses and over the past several years it's the R's who have voted down every D supported attempt at legislation to benefit vets and military families. I think the cognitive issues reside elsewhere.
184 2018-05-02 23:37:24 headcanon: oil can harry moved to the uk and became a comedian with swifty to get away with mighty mouse
185 2018-05-02 23:37:23 you don't need stats, just don't play dumb, you know it. albertans understand there are other industries besides oil, we just don't want them to be shoved down our throats just because they are clean or whatever, let market decide.
186 2018-05-02 23:37:18 Hallo :) Tech companies are making money from the data we're giving away for free? Let's tax them! #bitsoiltax But if data is the new oil, why not tax net giants on the use of customers' data?
187 2018-05-02 23:37:14 How about talking about the real cost of the oil sands? Disastrous for First Nations, the environment, Canada.
188 2018-05-02 23:36:20 he's bound to become coal and oil before climate change is repiglican platform.
189 2018-05-02 23:36:17 This was actually at Kentucky lake , our club tournaments champion ship and Lucas oil tournament are there at Kentucky lake.
190 2018-05-02 23:36:17 I hope he succeeds in getting us off oil and away from war. He has my support.
191 2018-05-02 23:36:10 With you. Ranted about this earlier in the day. It was an epic 15-parter. 
192 2018-05-02 23:35:30 Like?
193 2018-05-02 23:35:15 The Idiot did nyet. Look who nominated him, most are TEA. Meadows? He's leading the effort to impeach Rosenstein. I'm sure they got  from the Mercers,Kochs,RNC,CPAC donors. They want to apply some refreshing oil to a pile of in order to make him smell good for 2020.
194 2018-05-02 23:35:14 Just remember, Alberta hasn't see $100 bbl oil prices in Notley's time. I still wonder what the PC's did with that bounty.
195 2018-05-02 23:35:04 Majority of BC and Canada want it and support it. Global is helping the crazy tree hugging fact denying time wasting oil using tax wasting "protesters" with media attention. Somehow these idiots know the future of the unknown to make their case. So stupid. Facts win always.
196 2018-05-02 23:34:49 Nah, I paid a little extra for free oil changes lol
197 2018-05-02 23:34:12 Baby oil and iodine, plus 8 or 9 hours in the sun was the San Diego way.

206 2018-05-02 23:32:50 I worked in a theater during high school and our popcorn oil came solid in large 5 gallon buckets.  The popcorn machine had a heating element that you put into the oil that was also a pump that pumped up the liquefied oil into the kettle with the push of a button.

209 2018-05-02 23:32:16 Love coconut oil so much...not as a hyped up cure all but for its fabulously emollient properties. It's done wonders for our problem eczema/flakey/oily skin. Don't need virgin oil, the cheap stuff will do #thumbsup #protips
210 2018-05-02 23:32:10 Yep

212 2018-05-02 23:31:56 Then stop using palm oil!  ALL palm plantations replace biodiverse tropical forest! Use oils produced ib the USA.

219 2018-05-02 23:31:02 Did/do oil companies in Norway run for the exit?
220 2018-05-02 23:31:00 It's past time to end the protection of big oil and mining companies and protect our water and food sources instead. Otherwise one day humans will all be dead. Not that I don't think that would necessarily be a bad thing for our planet and wildlife.

261 2018-05-02 23:25:20 Alberta’s single resource economy is ill always leave them EXTREMELY vulnerable to ups and downs in the price of oil.
262 2018-05-02 23:25:09 Really, do you have the stats to back that claim up? I understand it’s hard for some albertans to realize there are other industries besides oil. All @jkenney is running on is oil. The future is technology, even with oil it will still be technology.
263 2018-05-02 23:25:06 Trump is not a Christian.  He’s cheated on his wives, has cheated people out of their money, started a fake university, has been bankrupt numerous times. He’s a snake oil salesman.

268 2018-05-02 23:23:34 I love my oil diffuser. It always calms my spirit
269 2018-05-02 23:23:34 Scalise has either not read the many studies of a carbon tax having little to no adverse effect on an economy (British Columbia, California, etc.) or his is worried about a loss of campaign funds from Big Oil.

271 2018-05-02 23:23:08 Right but why put truffle oil in it at all. Who was asking for Truffle oil in a hot sauce I’m sure it’s not made from real truffles.
272 2018-05-02 23:22:45 Been experimenting with popcorn for the last few days. Fave combo so far is popping it in hot coconut oil with demerara sugar and a pinch of sea salt .

279 2018-05-02 23:21:21 Actually none. Like faith healing. exorcism doesn't work the first time - nor does it work 67 times in a row. If it truly worked, we could do an exorcism for amputees or even conjoined twin phenomena.

But like all snake oil salesmen - you never do the impossible.

288 2018-05-02 23:19:59 US thirsting for the oil and resources of the region. 'Strategic interests'.

292 2018-05-02 23:19:04 My entire childhood we brought homemade popcorn in a paper bag transulecent from the oil. And it was actually better than the bought stuff. 
Oh my god, I’m officially old

294 2018-05-02 23:18:39 a local headstart teacher discovered two 4 year old boys engaged in oral sex in the bathroom at school.  Where did they learn that shit from?
295 2018-05-02 23:18:36 Oil makes the world go around.
296 2018-05-02 23:18:32 Now that’s jus crazy talk. Electricity comes from the hole in the wall and that’s the end of that. Zero emissions! Like magic! 
297 2018-05-02 23:18:16 how you feeling about oil? still like the fall to $66.50?

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
299 2018-05-02 23:17:54 Went to change the oil in the shitty whipper tonight. Never put the plug back in. Now I have a mess and my car has no oil. Fuck yes is it Friday yet?
300 2018-05-02 23:17:44 Why don’t they make travel-sized olive oil and balsamic vinegar?
301 2018-05-02 23:17:30 i just refuse to get my oil changed on my own my papa always gotta do it for me
302 2018-05-02 23:17:16 Thank you. Watch Pearson Sharp on OANN to find all these lies after lies from the politicians whose hearts go after Middle East oil & cash only.
303 2018-05-02 23:17:16 I can't wait to go to Greece I'm gonna shag a bottle of olive oil
304 2018-05-02 23:17:05 Today I went to get an oil change and they told me that my transmission hoses are rotted and it’ll be $280. And I just chipped my tooth. I’m currently sobbing like a baby... mostly because of my tooth. WHAT A SHIT FUCKING DAY.
305 2018-05-02 23:16:39 or drink 1/2 cup olive oil - equally gross.
306 2018-05-02 23:16:29 Bout to do an oil change on the chev. I think it's been 12k miles lol.

309 2018-05-02 23:16:17 Who do you think really brokered this deal? Trump with his basic grasp of reality. Or North Korea's oil supplier.Vladimir Putin. Trumps boss.
310 2018-05-02 23:16:14 lol, was busy ramming cash in accounts from SP2628 to 2661, banked the top, 3 nice oil rams, biotech rams and lifts, tech lifts, a few individual specialty names and gold miner ramrods but yeah bud, sp2668 failure level never touched, easy short, level down 2628/2610/2603/? we-C
311 2018-05-02 23:16:13 As for the energy of production, I'm not sure that oil sands are a paragon of efficiency, not if you look at any other petroleum deposit it must compete with. When renewables start kicking in as serious energy sources and oil gets squeezed, oil sands are toast.
312 2018-05-02 23:16:11 Everyone who buys products which contain palm oil is contributing to this. EVERYONE.
313 2018-05-02 23:16:00 I just scarfed down a heck ton of popcorn in front of a bunch of people at the oil change place and I’m not even sorry about it 
314 2018-05-02 23:15:56 1) Cannabis oil has not been proven to treat any cancer yet. Research is ongoing.
2) B17 is not a vitamin, it is laetrile which is toxic and has been found to have no medicinal value whatsoever.
3) Rerum appears to be a GcMAF scam.

Correct. You do not understand science at all.
315 2018-05-02 23:15:29 Finally, #WashingtonPost is cutting to the hard hitting questions  we’ve all been wondering about.  How about each wife decides what she likes her husband to call her. That work? Good. Lol
316 2018-05-02 23:15:07 Not an argument for or against but it's two things:

1 we "group" think and no one forms their own opinions anymore

2 cod liver oil tastes like shit but is very helpful. Mary Poppins always said that a spoonful of sugar yada yada yada
317 2018-05-02 23:15:04 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
318 2018-05-02 23:14:52 Higher oil & gas prices, a win for Exxon and Russia, sound familiar?  Trump will do and say anything to please the oil/gas lobby and his sponsor, Putin.
319 2018-05-02 23:14:50 are you somehow saying that UPC is going to stifle other industries because they are dumb enough to only care about oil industry? facts are that oil industry is what drives this country right now, period.
320 2018-05-02 23:14:37 Glad you're taking care of it, sometimes we gotta do those things to get us back in track! Also try CBD oil it should help a lot
321 2018-05-02 23:14:23 Leftists are determined and relentless in destroying every institution that promotes traditional values. Fundamental, foundational change
322 2018-05-02 23:14:07 It's closed like Standard Oil was closed. The name changed.
323 2018-05-02 23:14:06 Musk is the guy who put hs own money into a company which obliterated Russia's  income from foreign space launch contracts. So no wonder you are always negative about him. If Tesla succeeds Putin will be screwed as Russia's oil income will be decreased
324 2018-05-02 23:14:04 Use hair oil, change diet.
325 2018-05-02 23:13:58 My hair is so soft now. Coconut oil is the shit

331 2018-05-02 23:13:20 Conservation groups say the US Bureau of Land Management broke the law when it approved eight large oil and gas lease sales in Utah and several other states. And we'll find out why properly preserving plants is important to scientific research. These reports are ahead at 5:30.
332 2018-05-02 23:13:11 broke out after using a $90 oil gods way of telling me to stop impulse buying
333 2018-05-02 23:13:11 My #1 recommendation is CBD balm or CBD oil to ease the pain
334 2018-05-02 23:13:08 Just honey! Put it on your face like a mask, and you’ll have super soft skin. Or mix some coconut oil with sugar and gently scrub.
335 2018-05-02 23:13:06 Now that I think about it. I might actually have cbd oil pills at home lol
336 2018-05-02 23:12:58 Lucas Oil Stadium's soccer setup looks half-assed
337 2018-05-02 23:12:58 Now I'd like them to include the added impact of manufacturing the batteries and mining the components.
338 2018-05-02 23:12:54 Mike’s salary wasn’t gonna pay for all those kids plus a housekeeper she had to shill something. Plus they probably got free cooking oil in the deal.
339 2018-05-02 23:12:36 Good to see Kevin with Isaac Osei, CEO of Tema Oil Refinery chit-chatting about when to receive Springfield's oil for processing. Insha Allah....it shall happen.
340 2018-05-02 23:12:33 I always clean & oil my brother's #Muskie reels in the offseason, he waited until last night to drop them off & wants them in time for the #MuskieFishing season opener this weekend; at least he didn't wait until Friday night.
341 2018-05-02 23:12:31 Lots anger here watching this video. Why do we need palm oil?!
342 2018-05-02 23:12:25 can’t wait to end this day w a hot bath w bath salts n a few drops of lavender oil. 
343 2018-05-02 23:12:25 We have th technologies now to live without oil. Our government it the biggest road block.
344 2018-05-02 23:12:17 Translates to we are making this shit up as we go, to further our agenda
345 2018-05-02 23:12:10 Hey, I don’t know who came up with the idea of combining mayonnaise and olive oil but they sure knew what they were doing.
346 2018-05-02 23:12:08 Get bio oil
347 2018-05-02 23:11:59 No argelino es la tesis de quienes estudiamos finanzas , economia y entendemos la dinamica de las finazas publicas......ejemplo acabar el oil y ofrecer u gratis es una bestialidad.
Pensar q para jalarbel turismo, crecer el agro , hay q acabar oil es demagogia pura
348 2018-05-02 23:11:38 coconut oil everywhere
349 2018-05-02 23:11:17 I was 11,600 miles passed my oil change.. OOOPS
350 2018-05-02 23:11:11 There's a lot of money to be made by controlling the world supply of oil on behalf of the oiligarchy. 

Changing the price of oil is a classic "pump & dump" strategy that generates multibiillions of dollars daily.

361 2018-05-02 23:09:47 That’s what I’m hoping is to get rid of dark spots! The reduction of oil was a pleasant surprise though. And which scrub do you use?
362 2018-05-02 23:09:46 And maybe loads of taupaulin set up on the lawn for some oil wrestling...would be great on a sunny day..no neighbours to complain, would be heaven! xx
363 2018-05-02 23:09:13 So buhari went to USA to discuss on how to import USA agricultural products into Nigeria at the same time saying he can't force USA to buy Nigerian oil(which is the only thing he has to offer) and to declare his love for helicopters.
Carry scripted journalist go press conference.
364 2018-05-02 23:08:55 @bcliberals and @CPC_HQ put the interests of oil ahead of the people of BC and Canada. Their parties were funded by oil companies.  They also did not consults FN or the people of the province. if anything, they broke the law and people's rights. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM
365 2018-05-02 23:08:41 When will my cars oil change be done aaaaaaa
366 2018-05-02 23:08:22 I change my own oil, bought some ramps from the local auto shop and buy the oil and filter when it’s on sale. I refuse to pay for things I can do myself. Does it still sound incredulous?
367 2018-05-02 23:08:07 Moncrief used to blame the lighting @ Lucas Oil Stadium
368 2018-05-02 23:07:55 Well i got the lawnmower all ready just needs an oil change.
369 2018-05-02 23:07:52 I want our oil refined in Canada and sold to Canadians at reasonable prices.
370 2018-05-02 23:07:51 It’s time to burn the midnight oil on @gagasifm it’s #TheFirstImpression with the superhero... Manje wena #Uqwasheleni ???
371 2018-05-02 23:07:50 my apologies i hadnt seen these replies. I think that the extinction of the dinosaurs meant that there were less mammals being chewed up because of fewer scary predators. also one reason that we may have found 'only' 700 species is the process of turning into crude oil etc.
372 2018-05-02 23:07:32 1' - Underway at Lucas Oil for FC Cincinnati vs. Indy Eleven.
373 2018-05-02 23:07:03 I just remembered the time when I caught my son w the coconut oil jar, he was putting all over his face & ended it w "so I can look more cuter" LOL!
374 2018-05-02 23:06:51 OIL DIFF: 5.85 -> 5.82
375 2018-05-02 23:06:45 Welp, Lucas Oil Stadium can't look full every game.
376 2018-05-02 23:06:17 I'm thinking tents in the garden, an outdoor oil wrestling ring, fem wrestling matches and mini rolls...drinks in the evening..would be loads of fun!!
377 2018-05-02 23:06:15 pretty photoshop or is that real just to prove that climate change is actually fake we need more offshore drilling and oil drilling its good for the enviroment so once again gp is wrong and full of lies
378 2018-05-02 23:05:52 They rolled the upper deck curtains up at Lucas Oil for the Eleven game (probably because the roof is open). There are fewer people because it is a midweek game, but it looks desolate.
379 2018-05-02 23:05:36 Brush daily, vacuum daily, throw out all your clothes and buy new ones because there’s NO ESCAPE. Coconut oil maybe? Idk I hear that cures all things
380 2018-05-02 23:05:27 Same. I meant vaping nicoteen. Although I just bought some thc oil to try.

385 2018-05-02 23:04:42 Guys I'm making a renewable oil base that could be mixed with 2 stroke oil additives for small engines by doing some chemical changes to castor oil.

Retweet this please, I've worked on this since I was a kid, like 13-15 years old was when I started on it.
386 2018-05-02 23:04:38 Olive oil and bread would smack rn
387 2018-05-02 23:04:37 Direct enemy right next door was Iraq so let's say they have wmds everybody and it's in the u.s. is interest cuz they stop selling oil under the petrodollar, Iran funny they do the same thing not selling oil under the petrodollar
388 2018-05-02 23:04:20 “Kept”? They were going to sell them. Why would they be better with anyone other than the owners. What is it the Iraqis did to you? Did they invade your country, steal your oil and ruin your economy?

406 2018-05-02 23:00:51 @robinmowat-  Actually there are a lot of oil patch jobs being advertised for Estevan and Kindersley. Some of the companies are saying they are having a hard time filling positions $25-$40/hr.

414 2018-05-02 22:59:56 Farmers will likely grow fewer acres of soy, driving up cost of food and animal feed.  They may grow more corn or another crop.  Bottom line is that it will impact every one of us.  Virtually every processed food contains soy oil, or products made from soy.  Biofuel too.
415 2018-05-02 22:59:55 @AndrewScheer Stop confusing re Carbon Tax. Maybe you should open up some Oil Refinery Environmental Assessments and educate yourself on this topic. They all pay for exessive Co emissions same as Gas Pumps. You pay for it daily & don't even know it. #ShameOnYou

431 2018-05-02 22:56:17 There is just no logical reason for this except Government receiving tax revenue. I recall many years ago when Malcolm Fraser said we had to pay world  parity for fuel in case world fuel prices soared. No change there!! I’m sure we had our own oil in those days.
432 2018-05-02 22:56:05 Oh no. 

Well there are teachers here who are diffusing oil in their classrooms. So there's that.

443 2018-05-02 22:53:56 Maybe those are all too pedestrian though. If I really want to mess with the algorithms, I need to talk about how much I love alligator wrestling and how I never know how to keep my dentures clean and that my Maserati needs an oil change

448 2018-05-02 22:53:39 man ever since that oil boiled over my right hand, it looks super fucked up
449 2018-05-02 22:53:29 Is this a bad place to mention that women - particularly family members - are the chief beneficiaries of a man's bad actions? A man goes to war and you condemn that man and the atrocities you assume he committed while enjoying the oil, imports and diamonds he has secured for you.

453 2018-05-02 22:53:12 BTW, we have had carbon tax for many years. Try reading a couple environmental assessments for Oil Refineries and the taxed emissions by Government. Also, check out the gas tax. It's another carbon tax. We have many in electronics now.
454 2018-05-02 22:52:45 I got a box of chocolate mint protein bars today, but they have fish oil in them, just barely enough to taste it. It's a weird combination. It tastes like if you had thin mints and kippers on the same plate and ate the thin mints after they touched the kippers.
455 2018-05-02 22:52:29 i keep seeing the top of the thing behind as a drizzling attachment nozzle like for oil on the wine bottle and now i really want to see u drizzle wine on someone now

462 2018-05-02 22:51:12 Ay, oil doesn’t come from any one spicific part of the earth, and isn’t regionally exclusive. It’s all the same, and it’s not running low. That’s earth blood. And it’s not rare. You’ve been lied to since birth.

478 2018-05-02 22:49:38 The USD is backed not by gold or oil, but by the floating tonnage of the US Navy and their ability to project force globally.

That military spending is what ensures the USD remains the defacto global trade currency. Every US citizen's standard of living is maintained by it.

495 2018-05-02 22:46:47 Are you sure palm oil is the main source for deforestation.  Please make more accurate investigation outside Greenpeace information. Replacing palmoil with other vegetative oil will lead to more deforestation elsewhere. That is easy mathematics.

542 2018-05-02 22:39:36 It’s a deflection tactic. No chance fusion is viable in his lifetime so this is not a near-term threat to his oil/gas buddies, while a focus on fusion starves wind/solar (the immediate threat) of funding. It’s in the playbook.
543 2018-05-02 22:39:30 It's not PC, but joining the military requires, prbly above all else, 24/7 rationalizing.

549 2018-05-02 22:38:59 My opinion has always been that Putin's main goal for a Russian presence in that region is to have the ability to directly impact the oil market for personal gain, & to be able to engage in economic warfare through manipulation of that market. He is playing the long game.
550 2018-05-02 22:38:55 Never encountered the pollen issue. I swear by beard oil, but I don’t know if that’s a plus or minus for this issue.

560 2018-05-02 22:37:59 I dislike war more than anyone. Try living w/o oil in this world. No oil=100s of millions die. Countries go to war to secure their economies.
561 2018-05-02 22:37:57 and that is not from surging oil prices, but from legitimate growth.

564 2018-05-02 22:36:54 looking for gold dore bar buyer who can issue SBLC for 12month deal. CIF Dubai, HongKong, Korea, Japan, China.
565 2018-05-02 22:36:47 Yeah lit candles, an she had some kinda oil or lighter fluid inside her  an pushed it out .
566 2018-05-02 22:36:30 My beef is with a government that is compromising its GHG reduction targets by promoting the production & transmission of oil & gas. 
567 2018-05-02 22:36:23 All else equal it is far easier to budget with steady, reliable federal transfers than unpredictable, volatile oil revenue. The ability to avoid deficits must correspondingly be easier with federal transfers. All else equal, he repeats for emphasis.

578 2018-05-02 22:35:07 Brunei is in a bad shape and almost going bankrupt due to its bad economic policies. The Sultanate is experiencing hard time, relying on its decreasing oil & gas reserves, its economy is deteriorating so rapidly. City bank has left, so lucky that China has come to rescue Brunei.
579 2018-05-02 22:34:59 When oil field jobs dried up, many went to work in the fields
580 2018-05-02 22:34:37 Look we played you four times this season and destroyed you on three. You can’t handle success, that’s why your not basking in your league win. You’ve got a cheque book manager that continues to fail in Europe. You were fuck all before oil and will be fuck all after.
581 2018-05-02 22:34:27 Castor oil  and Indian oil all up in my weave  I'm going to be sleeping like a greaseball  and I can fry a egg on my head in the morning #castoroil #hairtips #hairgrowth #hairproblems

584 2018-05-02 22:34:21 God Bless our troops & their families. Mr Pres, I am a 100 % Trumpian and my tweets will show that. However, you extended massive tax cuts to industries and as the oil co's swallow them up, gas prices have soared almost 25-30%  & they are going up. $3.00 plus per gal. 
Stop this
585 2018-05-02 22:34:08 My boss brings beard oil to work.

The bitter part is you won’t win UCL
Just apply pressure like spurs
588 2018-05-02 22:33:23 Why @FoxNews employs this fool is beyond me. I turn the channel if he comes on.
589 2018-05-02 22:33:08 3) the same number of jobs that we had before in the oil industry will never come back as technology is eliminating a lot of those. Some rigs only require 5 people now where hey use to require 10+. I don’t hate oil, but I’m not dumb enough to think it’s the only industry we need
590 2018-05-02 22:33:04 maybe try jojoba oil? also make sure to dry your hands all the way after washing them/getting them wet too. I take a handkerchief with me in public so I dont have to use those air dryer things :)

596 2018-05-02 22:32:10 Literally, SNAKE OIL!
597 2018-05-02 22:31:38 ok but I invite my oil changed
598 2018-05-02 22:31:35 No doubt the effect is small. Not everyone can get an oil patch job (especially these days). To those at-risk of non-completion, a 40% higher min wage makes a life without education better than it otherwise would be. Which is, I guess, kinda the point of a living wage.
599 2018-05-02 22:31:32 Indeed. It’s the advantage transfers have over oil!!
600 2018-05-02 22:31:16 So corrupt! Must be due to big oil Exxon n Kochs!
601 2018-05-02 22:31:15 And people wonder why kids go shoot up schools, that's unbelievable
602 2018-05-02 22:31:11 ...also, try an oil free primer.
603 2018-05-02 22:31:05 But you still continued from there and worked on it for almost a year, and it is now a perfect oil painting. I went through the entire codebase, each and every detail has been so beautifully handled. True inspiration.
604 2018-05-02 22:30:50 2. As Tesla delivers M3 cars to customers organic desire and demand is created. Just like what happened with MS,X sales cycles. OPEC now has stated oil may hit $150 to $300 PB, Ford GM Chrysler restructure and double down on SUV& Pickup sales as VW fires its CEO and restructures

616 2018-05-02 22:28:07 Trudeau's master gameplan is to restart the Alberta economy with massive, province wide grow-ops.  He will stop oil production, and create instead a pot pipeline across BC, which will excite them terribly.  His green strategy also includes pot fuelled cars ... high at high speed.
617 2018-05-02 22:28:00 I needs an oil change and inspection 
618 2018-05-02 22:27:39 @Eric__Smith Is it just me or was the poor game from Poeltl rather costly last night?
619 2018-05-02 22:27:39 I guess because of the red oil being used 
620 2018-05-02 22:27:38 Yet oil has caused jobs to lost, deficits to rise, and economies to collapse. Alberta and Saskatchewan have resorted to #Austerity budgets because of years of mismanagement of oil wealth and failure to diversify their economies. #abpoli #skpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtecttheInlet
621 2018-05-02 22:26:31 I died my hair from black to blonde, CLUMPS were falling out. This made it feel so much better. To amp it up, heat the oil a bit first & sleep in a shower cap & towel around that. The heat penetrates your hair or something. i don’t know the science/magic of it
622 2018-05-02 22:26:28 "On fire." Kinda like an oil slick.
623 2018-05-02 22:26:00 I was supposed to go get an oil change and go grocery shopping, but I feel myself going into a food coma.
624 2018-05-02 22:25:51 how many hours of lamp oil could he supply?
625 2018-05-02 22:25:37 They made CBD oil schedule 1 way back in 2016. They’ve attempted to make Kratom schedule 1 multiple times as well. It’s pretty obvious they don’t care about us, just

628 2018-05-02 22:25:03 Same for tight oil. $SLB has some amazing completion monitoring and simulation kit that's just not finding a market right now. Simple recipe of "more sand, more water, more horsepower" has been working and it's pretty cheap. @anuj_goyal

634 2018-05-02 22:23:52 Ok, your country near Venezuela. I heard about the oil issue.
635 2018-05-02 22:23:50 I'm getting an oil change. Out of 10 ppl in the room mechanics have asked to talk to 6 people. Every single one they talked to was a girl. Thanks for trying charge me $60 extra, bud but I don't make a habit of being taken advantage of for having a pussy ;)

644 2018-05-02 22:22:08 Despite what people think nails can benefit from having nail polish on them. The biggest issue is when it's done or taken off incorrectly. Also try using nail oil (or just vitamin e oil, jojoba oil, or argan oil), preferably daily, to help them grow stronger.
645 2018-05-02 22:22:03 I do not order spiritual products from people who do not live the life that their products are supposed to help with. Fuck I look like ordering money oil from a broke person? Lmao they haven’t tested it
646 2018-05-02 22:21:59 Got an oil change today, bought two new tires, did my yearly eye exam & bought myself some new contacts, now I came to spoil myself at the mall. Life is good being an adult 
647 2018-05-02 22:21:58 An excellent post dear Azza on the importance of water Thanks!
At the end of the movie, "The Big Short", the real Michael Burry, says he's investing in clean water because it's going to be more valuable than oil. The next wars will be fought for water.
Timely post!
648 2018-05-02 22:21:53 btw you can’t put weed in oil 
and just cook it i’m irl dying
649 2018-05-02 22:21:46 Put loads of Olive oil  hair when it’s dry & comb it through, then leave it in a bun overnight. Before washing it out rub in shampoo before wetting your hair, then wash it normally. I’ve tried everything & go back to that every time. I try do it once a week

661 2018-05-02 22:19:56 No matter what shampoo + conditioner I use I still have to put in some oil or sleek lotion AND THEN blow dry it straight AND THEN either flat iron it or use a curling iron. Only then is it anywhere near what one might consider soft. Ps some boys are stupid.
662 2018-05-02 22:19:54 Amazing how childish @CPC_HQ and #UCP supporters act when they are confronted with opposing views on pipelines like #KinderMorgan. Harper's attempts to base the economy solely on oil backfired and ended up increasing deficits and lost jobs. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #NoPipelines

674 2018-05-02 22:18:38 My thoughts on the oil industry are that we should nationalize (or provincialize) oil. The federal (or better, provincial) government would contract with companies to responsibly extract oil. The profits would pay off our national debt and to shutter coal plants.

And guess what, China just created its own oil exchange with the middle east. I wonder where they plan on buying their oil from.
681 2018-05-02 22:17:50 Ok. Only thing I can find is they used algae oil at one point for healthy fats but discontinued because it was causing some people to puke.

687 2018-05-02 22:17:20 dry skin can be rough, flaky, ashy or red. dryness results from lack of fluids (water) or oils (moisture). i have dry skin. 
dry skin needs the perfect balance of fluids AND oil for proper hydration.
688 2018-05-02 22:17:13 I drink lots of water. Exfoliate with biore charcoal exfoliating wash every other day, use vitamin e oil at night, and a face mask every Monday
689 2018-05-02 22:17:11 Steve - I watched Season 1 but wasn't engrossed. Would you say Season 2 improved?  Another "timely" great show: "Occupied" (Netflix). The Russians "softly" occupying Norway because the Norwegians decide to shut down their oil production and use a newly developed energy source..
690 2018-05-02 22:17:09 lol, pay attention. Where is the oil supposed to go? Asia. Guess what area of the world has the largest continuing reduction in oil use? Asia.
And guess what, China just created its own oil exchange with the middle east. I wonder where they plan on buying their oil from.
691 2018-05-02 22:16:51 4H, another great program.  Don't get me wrong - I don't think mixing the sexes in this was a good idea, especially because it appears it was done more from a coercive angle.  I just appreciate girls learning to change the oil, skin a fish, and create a cool derby car!

694 2018-05-02 22:16:39 $70 for oil?! Idk I think they taxed
695 2018-05-02 22:16:29 You need to do some research to see how much "income" Canada gets from Oil flowing. Compare that to how much Canada subsidises the Oil industry.
696 2018-05-02 22:16:21 In a period of rapid change, no one's crystal ball sees farther than a few years ahead, so your predicted rate of return is probably as good as mine. However, a mined out oil sand lease isn't my idea of a clean environment, much less 20,000 sq. km of it. Good luck reclaiming that
697 2018-05-02 22:16:02 You'd think Tommy Drawdy is waiting on the arrival of a grandchild and not puppies lmao. He is trying her a medium steak in coconut oil
698 2018-05-02 22:16:01 He’s a snake oil salesman who ran a con on almost half the country and they bought in completely. I understand why now but maybe they will catch on and we can get him out of here before something devastating happens. It’s already bad enough.
699 2018-05-02 22:15:59 A few thousand klicks before my next oil change but shout out to @jiffylube on Larry Uteck for the free top up ... heaps of appreciation.

705 2018-05-02 22:15:12 Yeah I’ve just learned I gotta love my body at every stage oil myself up and call it a day hahah
706 2018-05-02 22:15:07 Protect your engine and make sure you get your oil change and fluids checked on time. Stop by our smog and see why we've been voted the best for the past 10 years in a row. #cherrypitvacaville #oilchangeplace #smogcheckstation
707 2018-05-02 22:15:03 Just ask Justin Trudeau where his trust fund is located and what his investments are in. That should help everyone understand why he will never allow Canadian Oil to leave our boarders except at a discount to USA!

709 2018-05-02 22:15:01 Get a oil defuser while u at it jus put a drop of it and water inside of it shit will hand u breathing better every day even when u aren’t congested
710 2018-05-02 22:14:43 Where's the protesters? Court challenges?  Hmm... pretty hypocritical?  By the way, if Vancouver goes Oil & Gas free, will they close the airport? Shut down transit buses? Halt shipping & Trucking?  Stop ferry's to the island?  Just wondering?
711 2018-05-02 22:14:31 Still selling their snake oil.
712 2018-05-02 22:14:28 If the government was so concerned about the will of the people why did it side with remain instead of being impartial?
713 2018-05-02 22:14:19 I swear Alicia is the only person I know that’ll describe an OIL as OILY.
714 2018-05-02 22:14:13 i accidentally melted a container with hot coconut oil and now i have hot coconut oil and no container to put it in
715 2018-05-02 22:14:13 Chevy cruze. It was $70 for the type of oil my car needs & $10 for the filter.
716 2018-05-02 22:13:05 games where players all sit/stand in a vat of oil. Might as well (as long as it's nap time.
717 2018-05-02 22:12:56 Some for the fries and ya body  RT @BertyNextDoor_: @Consistent__D get the oil
718 2018-05-02 22:12:55 Budget was on "about $45 but now crude oil sells for about $75 per barrel" Where the excess is going to?
Gov.Fayose — feeling thoughtful
719 2018-05-02 22:12:54 I learned to change my own oil and still don’t do it myself 
720 2018-05-02 22:12:35 get the oil
721 2018-05-02 22:12:21 Plot oil prices in euro since 2000... if you think the US dollar will decline next year, plot the euro price at $80.  Each age rates will mitigate the impact of higher oil prices.
722 2018-05-02 22:12:15 Yes, let the oil flow. How do you expect for us to afford to "go green" if we keep shutting down our current sources of income? The oil industry's proceeds should be paying for us to move away from oil.

What makes you think potash mining is bad for the environment?
723 2018-05-02 22:12:01 The disconnect of which you speak also exists in small provinces. In those provinces, federal transfers play the role of oil in AB.
724 2018-05-02 22:11:56 우정이라는 기계에 잘 정제된 예의라는 기름을 바르는 것은 현명하다.
It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.
725 2018-05-02 22:11:56 For now the US is currently tackling Russia in Europe in the supplying of gas and crude oil just to make sure they will weak economically.
726 2018-05-02 22:11:41 coconut oil do my hair righttt
727 2018-05-02 22:11:35 Some tips if you get it again! I’ve had a couple piercings do this on me, if you wash it with liquid soap, and do hot salt water compresses whenever possible it should help dramatically. Tea tree oil does wonders too! 11 piercings and Ive managed to get rid of and avoid keloids
728 2018-05-02 22:11:35 Oh, I was fine with being harrassed. I was arguing with the Sears Mechanic who was doing my oil change the day before the election. He called her the devil and tried to shout me down.  Sadly, he had the wrong bitch. I live for a good political shouting match .
729 2018-05-02 22:11:30 got my oil changed , bout to get some new tires and brakes on my baby and see how she acting lol might can hold out for another 5 years on something new 
730 2018-05-02 22:11:11 @iamseyishay does your slap smell like hot oil
731 2018-05-02 22:11:01 Finally US has become the largest exporter of crude oil

738 2018-05-02 22:10:07 They have a special on Wednesday’s so I thought I only would pay the $20 but my car uses diff oil
739 2018-05-02 22:10:00 Why? Seriously, why would anyone nominate him ever again for anything! He has done nothing good for anyone accept for him and his rich friends. Selling off public lands for oil drilling,meals on wheels, health care. So please tell me what the idiot in charge has done so noble?
740 2018-05-02 22:09:52 rub coconut oil, not all will come out but most of them will
741 2018-05-02 22:09:40 You could google "fat bombs", they are little balls made out of cacao and coconut oil with peanut butter. They're a keto thing, but they seem to tick all your boxes - and no dairy :)
742 2018-05-02 22:09:37 What a miserable way to live.
Dallas thanks you though for showing up and spending $ while you're there. 
743 2018-05-02 22:09:32 He shouldn’t have gone sailing while all that oil was pumping out tho.
744 2018-05-02 22:09:26 My wave all summer:

746 2018-05-02 22:09:16 #skincarereview : 

So far after dah try oil,gel,cream, serum for scars. The best one that u can get from drugstore is The Garden of Eden (orange bottle for scars) 

also, (not from drugstore) Alpha Arbutin TO ordinary serum. Only this 2 works fast enough for my skin 
747 2018-05-02 22:09:04 Aggregate data obscures so much. So many senior people in our world class oil and gas industry lost their high-paying jobs and have re-entered the labour force (if at all) in much lower paying jobs. Make peace when a proper recovery is throttled by crazy exogenous factors?  Not!
748 2018-05-02 22:09:02 I need to add tea tree oil to my shit
749 2018-05-02 22:09:01 Oil short trade out at the open for $$$. This was the second trade I gave at MIT, weeks before it happened.
750 2018-05-02 22:08:55 決行じゃぁぁぁ
751 2018-05-02 22:08:50 Really, which Soylent product are you talking about? From what I can tell they use soy protein and plenty of other stuff like canola oil, oat fiber, cacao (for the chocolate one) and other things that would be land based.
752 2018-05-02 22:08:35 Yeah but let the oil flow so economic performance improves right? And potash is just so environmentally perfect right?

You believe strongly in protecting the environment. 
753 2018-05-02 22:08:32 You mean Texan's don't want Putin to take your oil for pennies, put the cash in his, Trump's, Cruz, Ryan and McConnell's pocket and leave America with the GDP of Italy as he did his own country? I'm shocked!!
754 2018-05-02 22:08:28 That really is snake oil technology. What shafts were so flexible that a clubhead couldn't be kept square? It's a while since I read such nonsense

757 2018-05-02 22:08:01 This line to pay for my oil change doeeee 
758 2018-05-02 22:07:56 don’t wash it every day, drink more water, get a trim every few months take biotin or fish oil, use a comb when you wash it instead of a brush, wear it in a braid, avoid using heat, don’t use super tight hair ties, I could go on for days lol
759 2018-05-02 22:07:44 Take a pill, or a glug of oil, or whatever bots do to calm down. I'd say take a deep breath, but you're obviously on "spew lie" mode.
760 2018-05-02 22:07:30 Romaine, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, black olives, really good herb/olive oil marinated feta cheese, a stuffed grape leaf (seasoned rice inside), anchovies (which I didn’t eat, my daughter ate them), oil & vinegar dressing. Perfect.
761 2018-05-02 22:07:30 I just don’t like it, I’ll use baby oil b4 lotion 
762 2018-05-02 22:07:25 $80 for an oil change?
May as well throw the whole car away.
763 2018-05-02 22:07:21 I had migraines every now and then. They usually happen when I don't get enough sleep. Migraines are the worst, you feel like you can't move and you feel like you're about to throw up. But normally, drinking water, sleeping or using medicated oil works.
764 2018-05-02 22:07:08 I changed my oil, fixed my radio, went paid some bills, power washed the absolute fuck out of my driveway/back patio all before going to work.... I need a fuckin drank
765 2018-05-02 22:07:08 Thank you!! And haha, Norway gives foreign countries money to reduce deforestation as a way to “reduce” Norway’s carbon emissions. While at the same time most of Norway’s GDP comes directly from oil exports. So I was looking at if that is ethically just
766 2018-05-02 22:06:59 These vape oil pens be everythingggg. 
767 2018-05-02 22:06:48 Yesss. But Ahad is in a different ad. Well, both of them are in an oil ad but not the same 
768 2018-05-02 22:06:20 Only oil producing country in the world who found oil and got poorer.
769 2018-05-02 22:06:17 I've been eating kale as part of an AIP diet to heal Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.  It's lovely stirfried in coconut oil.

771 2018-05-02 22:05:41 there are so many oil paintings of white men here
772 2018-05-02 22:05:15 You think that's why the Russians are against it? Maybe it's really because their economy is dependent upon the price of oil
773 2018-05-02 22:04:51 I've heard coconut oil helps with skin irritation...
774 2018-05-02 22:04:49 How can I be going to the shop and my boy asks me to grab him some grapes, baby oil and a bottle of wine ..... nooooo not a fucking chance
775 2018-05-02 22:04:45 OIL DIFF: 5.88 -> 5.85
776 2018-05-02 22:04:42 Ya car just ride different when you get a oil change dawg...I forgot it used to move like this 
777 2018-05-02 22:04:26 I believe facts.

As a matter of fact the selfish greedy pig said...."They're sitting on all this oil rich land, but they won't drill."

I guess real native Americans value their heritage and native land more than money.

Trump wouldn't understand this...his God is money.
778 2018-05-02 22:04:06 It's Tolbi seafood pasta！ With lots of olive oil and basil！（トレビ）
779 2018-05-02 22:04:06 Yessssss and I use the rosehip seed oil to moisturize after? I feel ANEW
780 2018-05-02 22:04:03 If I hold two bottles of olive oil while I run, while that also turn into olive-muscle??
781 2018-05-02 22:03:58 Problem is 10000s people in North Burnaby strongly disagree with you and they bear all the risk for Texas oil giants greed

784 2018-05-02 22:03:28 Think of an athlete doing a very strenuous sport. Normally if they take in enough water & electrolytes they're in good shape but if they're even 1% dehydrated their performance deteriorates, a 10% shortage & they are collapsing. oil & the economy work likewise
785 2018-05-02 22:03:24 Lidl and coconut oil might just change my cash flow mentality 
Start thinking I'm holistic and rich and stuff.
786 2018-05-02 22:03:17 Just watching CNBC make me puke. How they cheer every uptick in oil demand. How they treat DOW as a sentient, if fickle, demi god, who "tries hard to stop 5 day loosing streak" or "break out of correction territory."
Then their series on "sustainable energy" sponsored by Total.
787 2018-05-02 22:03:06 Most houses in QC heated by electricity generated carbon free in James Bay. AB still has lots of gas and oil furnaces and coal fired electrical generation plants. Plus do we really believe Saudi emmission stats?

791 2018-05-02 22:02:42 Yeah. Not wanting to murder people for oil is such an un-American motive.

Good luck putting this genie back in the bottle.
792 2018-05-02 22:02:29 Unemployment is no respecter of class. First class no get job...PASS get job for oil firm.
793 2018-05-02 22:02:26 Day 2 of fast, surviving only on green tea + coconut oil/ghee. Hunger perseveres, energy not so down. Brain feels little different, if hunger persists tomorrow, break the fast! Thought of food keeps coming
794 2018-05-02 22:02:01 And that doesn’t seem like oil. It’s yellow and watery.
795 2018-05-02 22:02:00 I just went to the smoke shop to stock up on some CBD gummies and oil cause it helps with my back and I run into my boss who was buying a bong  she looks dead at me and goes “well this is awkward keep ur mouth shut and I’ll make sure u don’t get a random anytime soon”
796 2018-05-02 22:01:34 Top to bottom. Spreading the surface area of the oil probably makes it go rancid faster. Plus you'll just get it everywhere if the lid isn't secure. Shit can be messy!
797 2018-05-02 22:01:15 Another new item for me to put in my knowledge bank.

There are so many variables in oil. 

Producing and selling one crop of soy per year is so much easier on the brain (if not the pocketbook).
798 2018-05-02 22:01:04 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
799 2018-05-02 22:00:45 Note to self: do not put on lotion before going out into extreme humidity. I've felt like I got dipped into an oil spill all day.
800 2018-05-02 22:00:33 Something I learned recently:  If you have a toothache and there is no swelling or other sign of infection coat the tooth with Clove Oil once an hour and ride it out for a couple days. It will likely go away.

835 2018-05-02 21:55:23  Tip: Back away from the oil and sprinkle some sugar on top! Make sure your plantains aren’t half ripe either

844 2018-05-02 21:54:15 fantastic, especially given NZ's recent oil controversy

848 2018-05-02 21:53:35 @TuftsUniversity @Tufts4Climate @MonacoAnthony The University of Cali divested $200 million from companies involved in coal & oil sands projects. Syracuse committed to remove direct investments in coal, oil & gas companies, & Georgetown voted to end direct investments in coal.
849 2018-05-02 21:53:31 Well oiled machine.. however, I’m assuming the oil well has been dry for while..
850 2018-05-02 21:53:30 I was wondering that. Or some kind of flavored liquid. 

What about submerging in water or liquid for awhile first. Or coating in Olive Oil
851 2018-05-02 21:52:55 Doug ford sounds like a bad salesman.   Step right up folks....we have got some snake oil for you!
852 2018-05-02 21:52:43 Me: What if I just splurge and take $1000 from my savings and have the summer of my life?
My car: look at me
Me: It's been such a hard few years, fun would be...
My car: LOOK AT ME
Me: And I could smile for once and...
My car: *tires, oil, AC* BOOM!

854 2018-05-02 21:52:06 @WiredHoney  what 2 heck did pineapple ever do to you. You gotta treat her right, take her to a movie, put on some WHAM! As you grab a carving knife. It puts the coconut oil on its skin~
855 2018-05-02 21:52:02 The strangest thing to be about Korea right now is that they call gas stations oil banks 
856 2018-05-02 21:51:58 Climate change is something the gov. Has been lying about for years. There trying to get the electric car going. For they can get big money for selling electricty to charge the cars instead of the oil companys. Ele tric car put out more carben than cars. Fake
857 2018-05-02 21:51:54 yes! first it dries you out to make you think it’s working but your body is actually like wait, where my oil at? i’m gonna produce even MORE >:-)

859 2018-05-02 21:51:39 Venuzuela has of course been an oil producer for as long as its been a commodity. The hard facts for the US however is its also China's number one arms purchaser. Not the easy target it used to be. As for Iran well it has a defensive pact with Russia if my memory serves.
860 2018-05-02 21:51:32 Oil and gas outfitter mulls diversifying Houston operations amid new technology
861 2018-05-02 21:51:23 I forgot that summer ruins my life. Any tips for some sweat/oil resistant makeup bec I can’t do life like this.
862 2018-05-02 21:51:23 Worst part: Trump administration will use this as an excuse to break down environmental protections and open up public lands for their buddies to drill for oil.
863 2018-05-02 21:51:02 having a car is cool & all but not until you gotta get an oil change , gas etc ... 
864 2018-05-02 21:50:57 @CBCNews #onthemoney too much pro oil propaganda pushing pipelines and projects like Petronas sorry time to change the channel
865 2018-05-02 21:50:51 A temporarily lost normal part of trump's childhood. It was farted out from coal and oil furnaces everywhere. That is the gritty backdrop for his memories of 'acceptable' life. Plus rampant racism and gangsters.
866 2018-05-02 21:50:48 Just as most Americans have opted for big, hhhuuuuuggggeee vehicles. There is no reason other than oil company/oil country greed for higher prices this time. But higher prices were inevitable and those who bought road boats are once more duped.
867 2018-05-02 21:50:40 I took no pictures at the oil ranch 
868 2018-05-02 21:50:37 "US decision in Afrin".  I won't get into it...again...with you.  The West chose not to start a bigger regional war to save a doomed enclave sold out by Russia to Turkey for arms and oil agreements and deportation of islamists.  Sucks it happened.  Blame Russia.
869 2018-05-02 21:50:24 brought my mom’s truck to get an oil change and it’s so cold in heree

878 2018-05-02 21:48:58 Back to open dialogues with nations. even the Obama treaty with Iran didn’t go far enough because we still use 3rd party delegates to communicate with Iran.. enough is enough on the Anglo/Saudi usury/oil wars. @TulsiGabbard @Dennis_Kucinich @RandPaul @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump
879 2018-05-02 21:48:44 It’s made from flour, oil and water 
880 2018-05-02 21:48:41 I just started using an oil free moisturizer, and I thought my skin was doing well, but I did notice it was more oily later on in the day???? It all makes sense
881 2018-05-02 21:48:32 I’M SO ANNOYED! I need to get a fucking oil change and I try to go to the place by my house and I can’t get in it because of fucking construction... so i drive to the one in draper AND THEY’RE APPARENTLY CLOSED ON A WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON?! What in the actual fuck.

883 2018-05-02 21:48:27 .@POTUS put the toughest sanctions on NK that the US has ever imposed. He involved the international comm., pressured the Chinese to help by including sanctions on Chinese Banks, sanctioning 27 co. & 28 ships, shutting down maritime smuggling activities to obtain oil & sell coal.
884 2018-05-02 21:48:21 Tell that to the New Mormon Oligarchs changing Bears Ears & Grand Staircase for OIL! UT IS KILLING People with POLLUTION FOR MONEY!
885 2018-05-02 21:48:18 And yet Eastern Canada still imports Saudi oil rather than ethical Alberta crude, which HELPS ALL Canadians.
886 2018-05-02 21:48:07 so far no opinion. My hair is baby fine so I have to be careful about fly away and tangling. Too much oil of any kind makes my hair look even finer.
887 2018-05-02 21:47:47 hey guys. h. hey guys i just put omega oil in my hair
888 2018-05-02 21:47:44 Sea salt toner, just water and sea salt boil it then pour it in an spray bottle or tea tree oil, helps a lot when I'm having an active breakout :)
889 2018-05-02 21:47:28 Don't forget Mother's Day is Sunday, May 13th! What Mom wouldn't love a diffuser bracelet & essential oil kit? Especially one themed Peace & Quiet!! The 4 oil kit is only $23 & the braclets are all $9.99  Adjustable ones at that, so you don't have to worry about sizing 
890 2018-05-02 21:47:20 i feel like an adult taking fish oil supplements lol
891 2018-05-02 21:47:16 She's never been worth half of the attention she got as his partner which made her career.  She always reminded me of Fiona from Shrek in the face and Olive Oil with a boob job in body.  That was when she was younger.  She's worse now.

897 2018-05-02 21:46:44 I'm on this diet wherein I propose unrealistic healthy goals for myself and then I take a bunch of cheese and fry it in oil and butter and eat it while watching Ugly Betty.
898 2018-05-02 21:46:23 You are literally lying outright. Oil use around the world is still increasing and has for years and will for many more years. Canada in its stupidity, will miss out selling that resource to the world markets because of a lame PM,  and lame NDP Premiers.
899 2018-05-02 21:46:20 Soooo busy!!
Be useful:
$9 coffee

901 2018-05-02 21:46:07 there will be riots when trump visit but saudi leaders are treated like world leaders OIL might have something to do with it
902 2018-05-02 21:45:59 Because they’re so congested and perhaps because of the power station and oil refinery. Not forgetting the incinerator in Basildon
903 2018-05-02 21:45:58 If we win this final it will be bigger than Istanbul. Football was still fair game in 05, It is owned by Oil Money now. This season has defied the odds. Low net spend and still sold our best player. That Klopp fella is a beast

906 2018-05-02 21:45:02 He gave the orders. Cheney and Rumsfeld together with Condoleeza organized Iraq invasion to steal oil. Cheney was Halliburton ceo: direct source if army supply ... just saying.

909 2018-05-02 21:44:36 When the oil was booming!
910 2018-05-02 21:44:24 Ithaca is teasing me with this warm weather but I won’t believe it’s summer until the coconut oil in my pantry is liquid. That’s how you know it’s real. 
911 2018-05-02 21:44:23 Agreed. That group of backward corporate sycophants allowed a forest industry to continue the stupid practice of exporting raw logs and allowing American companies to rape our lands. Much like Alberta and foreign oil companies in their province
912 2018-05-02 21:44:16 If the UK Gov had invested in an Oil Fund as did Norway, you could have many more worthwhile investments to help the industry but they were far more interested in milking Scotland's wealth & spending it in London.
913 2018-05-02 21:44:01 Or your husband could be an asphalt plant operator and come home every day smelling like oil and asphalt.  That's sexy.  
914 2018-05-02 21:43:57 Who would want to be near gasoline, oil, gasoline stations, and noxious exhaust when one could buy an electric car from @tesla? The company that reported better than expected gross earnings today. #environment #pollution
915 2018-05-02 21:43:55 Liquid coconut oil weather is real dangerous in NY
916 2018-05-02 21:43:46 I use Neutrogena deep moisture. It’s a dark blue container. My routine: coconut oil to remove eye makeup, a gentle exfoliating face wash, and then night cream. Sometimes more in the AM if it’s been extra dry out. A night cream now will do wonders for your skin later!

919 2018-05-02 21:43:02 I heard people like to sauté it in garlic and olive oil. You know me though, I’m totally fine eating vegetables raw with no kind of seasoning. I’m probably no help here.
920 2018-05-02 21:43:01 Yes but that luxury part isn't necessarily true. With cap starting to be an issue next season, spending $3.5M on backups and not knowing if you'll actually have a competent one is troubling. Also, they'd be crazy to lockup Talbot long term even if he had a great year.

923 2018-05-02 21:42:14 No idea if this qualifies, but we do a rice bowl at home all the time that looks like this:

- Basmati rice (warm)
- Baby spinach
- Avocado (sliced)
- Tomatoes (diced)
- Tofu (fried, cubed)
- Feta
- Dressed with black pepper, olive oil and rice vinegar. Yum!
924 2018-05-02 21:42:13 If you think coconut oil or any other oil will get rid of your stretch marks LOL!

926 2018-05-02 21:42:06 Am totaly against what the iran is now ! But tbh the revolution was not aboit looking good,  it was about the corrupt government in the shah instilled by the british who   were stealing iranian oil money ! The situation is not better now , but it wasn't good then
927 2018-05-02 21:41:53 I'm all for using coconut oil on any skin problems I have, as a first port of call. I've a dirty rash where my leg was shaved last week and with the amount I've had to use, I smell like a Thai Green Curry.

929 2018-05-02 21:41:46 Arab oil embargo occurred starting October 1973. That had a huge effect on stock mkt. It wasn't all Nixon's crap.
930 2018-05-02 21:41:33 I did lavender and mixed it with olive oil, then rubbed it on the bottom of her feet before bed and it worked good for us 
931 2018-05-02 21:41:30 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
932 2018-05-02 21:41:30 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
933 2018-05-02 21:41:18 Conservation groups say the US Bureau of Land Management broke the law when it approved eight large oil and gas lease sales in Utah, Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Wyoming, and filed suit earlier this week in federal court. Matilyn Mortensen reports in the 4:04 Utah News.
934 2018-05-02 21:41:16 So they going to have beach patrols, luggage searches and confiscation at ports of entry? 
What's the fine? Criminal offense? Just symbolic?

963 2018-05-02 21:38:32 @NancyPelosi Nancy - - We Americans want to know why gas is going up and up!! Please get on TV and tell the American people how this Administration is behind the oil companies.  Under Obama, we produced so much oil, and prices went down.  Hurricanes must have recouped. Why?
964 2018-05-02 21:38:31 i checked me oil all by my self yesterday (cause I'm 700 miles overdue on an oil change and I wanted to make sure my car wasn't about 2 xplode)

976 2018-05-02 21:37:05 Or if they charged the oil companies sensible royalties.......
977 2018-05-02 21:36:52 It's not a naive question. The relative inventory level is an indicator that normalizes the petroleum inventory level for seasonality and time trend. The variable was originated by M. Ye & J. Zyren and has been used internally at the EIA to help to evaluate crude oil prices.
978 2018-05-02 21:36:50 I don’t and I can still relate. I had thick, long hair. I’m getting old now & it’s thinning out. I use an Argan oil spray leave-in conditioner from Poundland and it is AMAZING. No tangles

980 2018-05-02 21:36:43 Well said.  Abbas try to show some intelligence to his supporters but is it even close to be true.  Does all 6,000,000 Jews were lenders in the banking System?  It's like saying that all Arabs have oil wells in their back yard. What a joke.

  Netanyahu, Best president ever.
981 2018-05-02 21:36:42 Chuck Schumer- -you need to stay on top of other things too, please.  Americans want to know why gas is going up and up??  Under Obama gas went down because of the oil we were producing.  I know the hurricanes didn’t help, but that doesn’t take much time to recoup.  It’s wrong!
982 2018-05-02 21:36:29 Considering my copy of MM3 filed my taxes, balanced a checkbook, and changed the oil on my car I'd say no! This game can do it all!
983 2018-05-02 21:36:13 They are sailing full tankers up and down the coast. Sooner or later they will have a fire sale on oil. (OPEC I mean)
984 2018-05-02 21:36:12 my @Woolzies breathe essential oil blend makes me smile every time I walk into my office. My office roommate laughs at me because I'm just so darn happy it smells so good. #essentialoils #humpday #littlethings
985 2018-05-02 21:36:04 Not a bad thing, can we get electric and leave the oil leaking disasters behind....
986 2018-05-02 21:35:38 I do a local toad patrol to help them across the road. I wear a hi-viz vest & carry a British Rail oil lamp like I'm from The Signal Man.
987 2018-05-02 21:35:36 You must have missed trump disrespecting the code talkers. 

How can a native American with pride for their people support him?

Trump believes that drilling for oil is more important than sacred land promised to the native Americans centuries ago.

Do you agree with him?
988 2018-05-02 21:35:27 SunCor cranks out a bbl of WCS crude from the sands for somewhere around $25. Didn't we hear every eco-loonie in Canada screaming to shut down the oil sands because prod'n costs too much? Yeah, they said that. Now, the Oil sands are giving U the best economy in Canada.
989 2018-05-02 21:35:22 Does oil and water mix?
990 2018-05-02 21:35:21 That's how it was explained to me, anyway. The price of oil pretty much only goes up over time, so the price of gas and tires go up over time. It fluctuates, but long-term increases.
991 2018-05-02 21:35:18 If you’re ever feel bad about yourself just go get your oil changed and you’ll be feeling like a model by the time you leave
992 2018-05-02 21:34:28 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
993 2018-05-02 21:34:25 I really hate putting oil in my hair
994 2018-05-02 21:34:24 Just the ones which aren't beholden to environment inc.
995 2018-05-02 21:34:08 This country has been laughing behind our back's since 911. The US and the UK get the oil. While Saudi Arabia funds the Terrorist.
996 2018-05-02 21:34:06 Sick= oil of oregano= pizza burps. That is all. 
997 2018-05-02 21:34:03 A great way to bring safe, reliable, carbon-free electricity to remote regions or disaster areas.

Too bad Russia is using it to power its oil and gas mining operations, to sell to places like Germany which have to replace their shut-down nuclear power plants.
998 2018-05-02 21:33:58 Very soon Nigeria will stop selling oil. Trump will build eletric cars for Nigeria. Buhari will manage it.
999 2018-05-02 21:33:56 ur mcm has a 55 gallon oil drum of all his toenails he's ever cut. it's almost full.
1000 2018-05-02 21:33:44 Alberta Cons are "anecdotal" economists.  If one of their pals on the oil patch loses a job, the economy is thereby in the tank.  Forestry, mining, manufacturing, fisheries?  What's that about? @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ
1001 2018-05-02 21:33:41 If those birds wanted special protections, they should have been born as oil companies. Stupid birds.

1005 2018-05-02 21:33:00 Benoît Lamarche, who headed this research, has become a key "go to" academic for dairy industry funded research. His results are often very predictable just from the titles so I am cautious about his work - cheese beating olive oil would be just too obvious even for him though!
1006 2018-05-02 21:32:55 1/Demand inelasticity to higher oil prices has been an entirely Non-OECD phenomenon the past decade, with an obvious explanation: adoption by new users comes up from low levels (if not zero), in very small units.

1009 2018-05-02 21:32:27 It's about Oil sands crude, which Liberals' hate.  Wasn't it the PM who said the oil sands must be phased out? Yup, he did.  Here's some news. That CDN Heavy oil you despise is VITAL to the USA, contrary to the enviro nuts assertions it is marginal supply.

1011 2018-05-02 21:32:08 The only way Canada can meet its Paris emissions reduction target and increase oil sands production per Alberta's current climate plan is to shutdown Ontario. No number of McKenna/Trudeau lies will change this fact.
1012 2018-05-02 21:32:06 Oil
Brent crude rose by US23 cents or 0.3% to US$73.36 a barrel. The US Nymex price rose by US68 cents or 1.0% to US$67.93 a barrel.

1013 2018-05-02 21:32:02 The DWP most certainly have not. In fact they have confirmed the opposite.
The (ludicrous) oil price was the basis for fiscal policy. This was conceded a couple if years ago.
Even the two years to separation was laughable, they haven't managed to take more powers in longer!

1020 2018-05-02 21:30:49 There's a lot to unpack there.  Firstly, it's about directional progress.

Given the choice between foreign oil or domestic coal, which would you pick?  Given the choice between being unemployed and broke or working on a coal plant, which would you choose?

1038 2018-05-02 21:29:08 Therefore it’ll be unreasonable to take a drastic measure in terms of changing the pace of the reforms only because oil prices have increased (recently)
1039 2018-05-02 21:29:01 Is adulting playing fortnight while your car gets an oil change?
1040 2018-05-02 21:28:57 so if things go well,,,, imma be painting one of my bts in anaheim photos for my oil painting final :^)
1041 2018-05-02 21:28:49 So I take my car to the shop to get oil change. They come back and say that my back brake pads need to be replaced. I said that’s cool, but I won’t have time to do that today I’ll come back next week. OK cool.
1042 2018-05-02 21:28:37 Olive oil, Maldon salt and lemon zest. Then lemon juice the second it comes out of the oven, sizzling on the hot pan
1043 2018-05-02 21:28:35  it was oil
1044 2018-05-02 21:28:18 As I prepared to give a final exam review for Modern Middle East History I learned that PetroCanada was formed as a crown company in response to the 1973 oil embargo. Moral: what may seem like tedious labor  can be marginally enjoyable?

1047 2018-05-02 21:28:07 We only do that for oil, minerals, and heroin 
1048 2018-05-02 21:27:57 The oil price used at the time was lower than the forecast by the UK. And the entire fiscal policy was not based on oil. And the DWP have confirmed that UK Govt are liable for pension entitlements accrued.
1049 2018-05-02 21:27:34 Coconut oil is awesome too!!
1050 2018-05-02 21:27:33 Lobbying your MP is exactly what needs to be done - you are correct - this is ‘avoidance’ on a massive scale - construction workers, oil and gas workers, health workers - it’s extraordinary - your mp needs to be aware that these people will go bankrupt in his constituency

1058 2018-05-02 21:26:35 Perhaps because high oil prices are unsustainable at the moment, the increase just happened recently. And on the other hand, the reforms have been planned based on the budget hence the previous (lower) oil prices.
1059 2018-05-02 21:26:20 Thank you! Coconut oil breaks me out badly unfortunately :/ I’ve been using raspberry seed oil for natural spf for years but want need something more substantial.
1060 2018-05-02 21:26:16 As an Oil fan, and seeing this signing, do you have an opinion on Mikko Koskinen?  I see what team he plays for and worry Chiarelli has fallen for a smokescreen performance...
1061 2018-05-02 21:26:10 A2: How basic are we talking? There is not enough time in the day to accomplish everything and I think some skills should be learned from parent or guardian like changing flat tires, balancing check book, changing oil, operating washer/dryer etc.  #BerganEdChat

1102 2018-05-02 21:20:06 You can't continue to over rely on importation and expect your country or economy to grow 

No way and this has been our mistake since the discovery of oil but instead of solving this we keep blaming our leader and not like they are not guilty as charged but we're also guilty

1114 2018-05-02 21:18:24 Russia will stop passing oil via Ukraine to the EU in 2019. Russia is totally entitled to do so. Why should the world go to war with Russia to force it to give oil, gas to Ukraine?
1115 2018-05-02 21:18:23 Grilled radicchio with olive oil and a little balsamic vinegar and roasted potatoes. Or an endive salad with lemon vinaigrette and rice pilaf.

1117 2018-05-02 21:18:18 Yes, but you get the point I'm making. We don't directly consume oil. We extract it and it gets embedded into a supply-chain to produce gasoline, plastics, etc..

Something like farmland or food is a better case for the point I'm trying to make than oil.
1118 2018-05-02 21:18:07 Always found it interesting that during Alberta’s boom there was little investment outside of the oil industry. Instead there is no PST and every Albertan gets a cheque from Klein - then when the oil price collapse occurs AB votes NDP - then blames them.

1151 2018-05-02 21:14:59 You might be onto something. Wealthy interests take the states and cities for a ride far more often than at federal level. It is easier b/c it costs less. But, no question the top dog GOP donors (Walmart,Koch,Big Oil,&others) far outpace any other party in buying pols.

1165 2018-05-02 21:13:44 I didn't suggest the world will run out of oil. I'm saying that all the cheapest wells to extract get extracted first, forcing future drilling to go to higher costs.

This assumes no leverage, inventory buildup, etc that we have. So it's more applicable to food than energy.

1167 2018-05-02 21:13:24 We consume oil, not wells.
1168 2018-05-02 21:13:23 Just heat it up and shake it! Just be careful. Even when heating the oil it can pop and stuff, but it cleans really well and eliminates that alcohol taste

1187 2018-05-02 21:11:15 I would more describe it as 'not as hawkish as feared'. The statement is resolutely hawkish on inflation side getting close to the 2% target. .... now guess what will happen when inflation goes OVER that target? ISM prices paid yesterday + oil prices = answer soon

1196 2018-05-02 21:10:07 You are right to point out this possibility,  as they will both be free agents next year. It's not like the Oilers are going to lock up Talbot long term if he records two consecutive bad seasons, and failure next year would open the door for a replacement, but >
1197 2018-05-02 21:10:01 omg no way do you add anything with the coconut oil or just heat it up and shake?

1199 2018-05-02 21:09:56 The German term is not actually problematic, though the English one is. Probably why the oil is called Canola oil in North America.

1219 2018-05-02 21:07:29 I gather from that statement that he will still be a Sask resident for income tax purposes just like the Bluenosers  and Newfies who worked in Ft Mac when oil sands was hot. One should research before one makes an erroneous assumption
1220 2018-05-02 21:07:22 I roast mine too. Just oil and salt then acid after it comes out. A few crumbs are a treat too.

1223 2018-05-02 21:07:19 Russia remains one of the largest oil producers in the world with 13% of the global oil supply in 2014;
1224 2018-05-02 21:07:18 How about replacing palm oil for soy, canola oil, it's all the same when it comes to garbage like Doritos, etc.
1225 2018-05-02 21:07:17 oily skin still needs moisture. if you are oily/combo, steer clear of oil-free products, they tend to dry out your skin and cause it to produce even more oil. 
instead, opt for a lightweight oil, like jojoba which actually rebalances your skins oil production.

1264 2018-05-02 21:01:20 Ok. says it's legal. Has stations sell it in all forms! Oil, water, shatter, etc. Now what Ok? My conservative pharmacist it. We make Charlotte's special cbd here. KanTech labs, sold for millions recently. We have sales teams selling cbd here.
1265 2018-05-02 21:01:15 Nothing to see here alums. Keep sending that money.  Actually wait don’t bother. We got all that Pilot oil money.
1266 2018-05-02 21:01:07 honestly i keep flirting with this oil painting brush but I should give it a go with just the regular marker-like brushes again
1267 2018-05-02 21:00:44 Love using tanning oil. Hate having sand stuck all over me.
1268 2018-05-02 21:00:43 oooo coconut oil? what does tht do?
1269 2018-05-02 21:00:42 Actual City fans ACTUALLY claiming that UEFA have fixed this because they want a Real vs LFC Final...!

PAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA....!

They obviously don’t realise how much UEFA hate us. 

Oil Money FC - What a set of whinging, whining, cryarsing dickheads.
1270 2018-05-02 21:00:34 Apply jojoba oil for 20 minutes before going to the shower. This promotes fast hair growth!

1273 2018-05-02 21:00:20 You’re a right one to preach, how much oil and salt and sugar is in your cooking recipes??  hypercritical springs to kind!
1274 2018-05-02 21:00:19 May 02, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1275 2018-05-02 21:00:14 Disgusting. Why are we (US) not placing sanctions against them? Oh yeah they have oil
1276 2018-05-02 21:00:13 @ChevronRichmond how do you produce so much oil in the city of @CA_Richmond  yet its 3.79 on my corner and the Arco sells gas for 3.35 across the street?
1277 2018-05-02 21:00:08 i don't know wtf I did in my makeup routine but I didn't oil up as fast  teehee
1278 2018-05-02 21:00:05 Looks like demand destruction is more a function of the economy not oil prices.  Perhaps there is some correlation to those two but no doubt recessions are when demand destruction occurs.
1279 2018-05-02 20:59:44 Baby oil sex ....is it rubbing your body down before sex lmao 
1280 2018-05-02 20:59:37 How about mayo made with oil that isn’t disgusting and eggs from pasture raised hens. Either safflower, olive or avocado, in that order. Canola oil is so gross. Even worse is soybean oil. YUCK!!! Just say no to GMO’s.
1281 2018-05-02 20:59:33 An overhead loudspeaker crackles to life, ‘Citizen! Report immediately to the National Baby Oil Slip-n-Slide.’
1282 2018-05-02 20:59:24 He would be much more credible if the environmental movement of which the greens are leaders were not taking millions from foreign interests to keep our oil landlocked. Would you ever speak out against the foreign money influencing our electoral and environmental policies?
1283 2018-05-02 20:59:20 No crude oil above ground in Borno that one knows of and besides, crude oil is even more cumbersome to move overland. Would be easily detected
1284 2018-05-02 20:59:18 Today's lesson from @UTKnoxville , stand up for what's right, get fired. Go against anything the oil baron and politician want? Get fired. This university deserves Paul Stanton.
1285 2018-05-02 20:59:09 Price controls, in case you weren't aware, are a socialist tool, not of a free economy.  What Trump is doing in loosening emission standards is creating a huge windfall for car and oil companies, who flood GOP cands with $.  Our air gets hotter & dirtier & Big Oil makes Big $$$$.
1286 2018-05-02 20:59:07 Yea, babies be sucking us dry lmao. I had the same problem I start brushing with coconut oil and taking vitamins and drinking more fluids.
1287 2018-05-02 20:59:00 Someone takes our place suppling the worlds oil need
1288 2018-05-02 20:58:47 Drink that motor oil bby
1289 2018-05-02 20:58:36 Seriously...No oil!!! So glad I trusted the last guy with my car! 
1290 2018-05-02 20:58:36 Olive Oil Pecan
1291 2018-05-02 20:58:33 For sure they can spend money, they just have a little problem.. 
They don't and can't spend oil money 
1292 2018-05-02 20:58:23 Remember when Brown was the "age of the limits" guy back in the 70s? You know, before we ran out of oil in the 90s. I bet there's a gold mine of quotes from that era.
1293 2018-05-02 20:58:23 sorry for the confusion!! In researching palm oil (due to the harmful effects) a website indicated your usage of the palm oil. I will continue to consume ur product now knowing that it doesn't contain palm oil :)  #stoppalmoil #Startwith1thing #SaveLeuserEcosystem
1294 2018-05-02 20:58:08 Well said. Most of the country keeps waiting for the other 35% to see this corrupt, lying snake oil salesman for what he is. Some will evolve, but there will be about 30% that will support him no matter what. But enough about Anthony...
1295 2018-05-02 20:58:02 Hiding something, i think. It's totally NOT sop, & once again Ms. Wolf has been proven correct.  Shame, shame. Lies drip from SSA's tongue like oil from a leaky barrel, just as trump's tweets flow like sewage.
1296 2018-05-02 20:57:58 Whining is when the oil to fix the squeak is sitting right next to you and you don't lift a hand to reach it.
1297 2018-05-02 20:57:49 It seems everyone Trump knows is tied to Russia. We MUST revisit the first rule Trump repealed - the transparency rule for gas and oil companies. This was INTENTIONAL for Russia & Trump cronies! #ManchurianCandidate Impeach @realDonaldTrump only thing he's good at is laundering $
1298 2018-05-02 20:57:43 Obama operated for 8 yrs behind a facade of legitimacy built on  lies. 
Slowly being exposed for the fraud he was.
1299 2018-05-02 20:57:35 oil for logistics.....and energy blockchainpossibilities to discuss by politicians and nerds.#fintech #un level When? @antonioguterres

1301 2018-05-02 20:57:11 This would make far more sense if there wasn't already a girl scouts.... they just need to revamp it. I was in girl scouts when I was a kid and we camped and learned how to change the oil in a car and how to make pizza over a camp fire... ya know the important stuff
1302 2018-05-02 20:57:02 Actually going to be the new location of the Chiefy blow and go. It's like a full service gas station like days of yesteryear. Chiefy will run out, fill your car, check wipers, check oil, blow you, and make sure you have an air freshener in 10 mins or less.
1303 2018-05-02 20:56:51 Looks like they are going to need a couple of Freedom Platoons. Do they have any oil?
1304 2018-05-02 20:56:51 Thank you - it was the added element of spice or oil I wasn’t sure about, to give it that kick and make it a bit interesting... 
1305 2018-05-02 20:56:43 #BritainsFatFight .... we must  eat more vegetables ....it's super easy to make them interesting  just like @HughFW has just shown... roast, stir fry, griddle them, a little oil, paprika, oregeno, balsamic vinegar... delish!  #NewcastleCan #5aday #NewcastleUponTyne
1306 2018-05-02 20:56:43 When I am sick, I will call the elders of the church to pray over me and anoint me with oil in the name of the LORD and the prayer offered in faith will make me well. The LORD will raise me up. 

James 5:14-15
1307 2018-05-02 20:56:40 Basically the same but with a few on the fly fracture index and RQD calculations... do prefer oil core though, those recovery depths with oil core are much cooler... you can’t really imagine those numbers in visual terms!! #geotechnics #oilbasins #corelogging
1308 2018-05-02 20:56:17 White girls love to take pictures wearing lingerie in front of the stove. That's also a sign of terrible cooking. You're telling me that neither grease or oil is going to pop on you? What are you cooking? Air?
1309 2018-05-02 20:56:09 @realDonaldTrump If you would like to start making “deals” with the oil companies now before gas prices get too out of hand, we’d really appreciate it.
1310 2018-05-02 20:56:01 @carmichaeltimo1  lesson to self, don't leave headlight turned on, results in flat battery, just reconnected horn no working, panic doh flat battery  your charger is in use  gearbox oil topped up tyres checked now starting to check over n polish fookin night shift here

1312 2018-05-02 20:55:36 Someone call the fragrance police: a lavender oil slick in the bath tonight.
1313 2018-05-02 20:55:29 And I heard a rumor that Venezuela is working an oil deal
1314 2018-05-02 20:55:23 Affordable CBD Oil News Thank you for following me!!
1315 2018-05-02 20:55:23 Rosehip oil! The 100% virgin cold pressed, very affordable
1316 2018-05-02 20:55:20 argan oil is definitely never touching my hair again shit stinks
1317 2018-05-02 20:55:20 Gas 2.81 a gallon driven by Wall St speculation, said MSNBC guest who mentioned Netanyahu's recent attack on Iran as 1 factor.
... Petroplutocrat capitalists attack socialist Venezuela, oil producing
Iran and Russia.  The vast majority of US citizens pay cost.
1318 2018-05-02 20:55:17 If people just stopped using the stuff, for all the moaning and groaning about the evils of oil and gas coming from Vancouver you would think no one uses it.
1319 2018-05-02 20:55:13 Just know that u r not Zimbabwean enough if you haven't considered frying vegetables with Vaseline for cooking oil #zimbosneedjesus lol
1320 2018-05-02 20:55:02 Soapers ? I'm ready to soap again after 2+yrs but my Mac and all my recipes died. Thinking a pure coconut oil soap is wise but I'm staring at my rice bran oil in sorrow. Best recipe for diving back in? (Think Pringle tube batch rather than a 5lb loaf.)
1321 2018-05-02 20:54:57 Easy to do - chop up loads of veg - onions, peppers, courgettes, aubergine, beetroot, potato, swede, parsnip ... sprinkle with olive oil, salt, pepper and other spices bake in oven for 30-45 minutes. Doesn't have to be exact - some veg takes longer than others.
1322 2018-05-02 20:54:49 @MissNikkiBrown I loved your article on the benefits of JBCO! It's so great for moisturizing your hair and scalp- but did you know that when mixed with vitamin E oil, JBCO promotes hair growth? That's what @naturallclub does with their JBCO Growth Serum
1323 2018-05-02 20:54:30 My favourite perfume - my sweat.  ( I have never used a perfume or a deodrant in my life ) my favourite tooth paste - Baidyanath Red Manjan. My favourite soap - godrej cinthol. My Favourite hair oil - parachute coconut hair oil. My favourite food anything लेकिन only pure Veg.
1324 2018-05-02 20:54:18 Coconut oil dries out your hair.
1325 2018-05-02 20:54:07 We really, really have. And I'm glad to finally be saving $200/mo or more on not buying oil.
1326 2018-05-02 20:54:07 طول ما انا بذاكر ال Volatile oil و انا علي بالي فيلم Perfume The story of a murderer  و حاسه عاوزه اتفرج عليه تاني معرفش ليه 
1327 2018-05-02 20:53:58 @SenateMajLdr 
Just looking at the stock market dropping yet again. With unemployment so low people are pouring billions into the market every pay day. 
Oil prices up yet again, healthcare out of control

Your tax plan isn’t working just like in Kansas 

Protect Mueller Now....
1328 2018-05-02 20:53:55 If I put coconut oil on my grades will it help them too ?
1329 2018-05-02 20:53:45 even worse, vegetable oil spread.
1330 2018-05-02 20:53:44 Coconut water tastes like coconut oil smells.
1331 2018-05-02 20:53:29 @jacindaardern should be tackling the spread of fake news  as it’s proven to have an effect on ignorant voters. Do people learn nothing? This is happening the world over where extreme right are spreading false stories to make voters turn parties sponsored by the oil industry
1332 2018-05-02 20:53:27 Debating methods of shipping/extracting oil is not even remotely equivalent, ethically or politically, to debating whether or not to violate the established Charter rights of women and LGBTQ+ folks. Unreal and pathetic you would even attempt to draw an equivalency here. #ableg
1333 2018-05-02 20:53:21 Just 1 more thing in a growing list shining a light on how bad Obama really was.
1334 2018-05-02 20:53:18 Walked out spending $70..... on 5 different soaps, toothpaste, Lotion, baby oil. I have a problem

1336 2018-05-02 20:53:16 Not regularly... I did in the past, but AJ is not my thing. But I'm fine with anyone going on his show. I think it would be better for him to build a stronger network by bring more real journalist and cut the snake oil sales. But hey, that's just my 2¢
1337 2018-05-02 20:53:14 i have and tbh i love all their products. i use their coconut oil like every week for my hair
1338 2018-05-02 20:52:59 somebody please pay for my oil change that 90$ a killer
1339 2018-05-02 20:52:46 By the way just as KLM needs to be very careful with raising the structural cost basis. The competitive environment is very fierce and these positive and good results might be incidental and mainly due to economic revival and low oil prices. Long term vision should prevail.
1340 2018-05-02 20:52:46 Ok so Hugh is on tv tonight slating Nando’s for its sugar loaded food but his and Jamie’s restaurants serve oil, sugar loaded food on their menus ! Hypocrites
1341 2018-05-02 20:52:40 my sis just put some tea tree oil on my face b/c pimples won't gtfo but anyways am I the only one who doesn't like how tea tree oil smells??!
1342 2018-05-02 20:52:29 Ye is not the problem bro We are the problem forget what Kanye West said it doesn’t change the facts ... Kanye didn’t give our oil to the white man , kanye didn’t give our gold to the white man, kanye didn’t force our greatest minds to work for the white man.

1347 2018-05-02 20:52:00 Hey Archie  - 
our Ush suffered from itchy grass-seed allergies ; coconut oil really helped , might be worth a shot if you haven’t already tried it.
1348 2018-05-02 20:51:58 Fun fact they didn't use oil, when you have sex with a Gracie May Green in the wild they naturally secrete fluids all over their bodies
1349 2018-05-02 20:51:58 @BradSchimel & his DOJ refuses to follow the law and is going to cause  millions of dollars of investment to be pulled out of Wisconsin because  they can't handle the pressure from an out of control DEA.  Industrial  Hemp CBD oil IS NOT illegal! @VickiMcKenna @JayWeber3 #wiright
1350 2018-05-02 20:51:49 Today I been catching up on my #desk with paperwork and phone calls. As for the #Acura last night I finished adding the remainder of the quarts of #oil and I have bled the #brakes with a friend today. I still need to test drive the vehicle. I am now working on the Invoice.
1351 2018-05-02 20:51:34 I follow it up with their Marula oil mixed into my regular moisturizer and my skin becomes un-flaky, even in winter.
1352 2018-05-02 20:51:15 i need 3,000 area and we can start a factory for Oil for Animal Feed with in 100 mile range #Missouri Federal Farm Bill will Trump State law 3142762573
1353 2018-05-02 20:51:15 Interesting. It seems that it's a different species, and the recipes are very different too. Just try the anchovies over sliced avocado and some drops of olive oil, and you'll see the doors of Walhalla 
1354 2018-05-02 20:51:12 I steam them for 10-15 mins on high heat and transfer them to a non stick pain. Add olive oil, minced garlic and pepper 
1355 2018-05-02 20:51:07 pink himalayan salt, epsom salt, bergamot, sweet orange, coconut oil and lavender in my bath soaks 
1356 2018-05-02 20:51:04 Innocent kids are being killed and brain damaged every day by preventable diseases like measles. Try educating yourself with medical facts, not internet bullshit by snake oil salesmen who want to sell you useless “cures” to get their hands on your cash.
1357 2018-05-02 20:51:04 Aww how nice my bacon is giving me little love bites of oil on my wrist 
1358 2018-05-02 20:51:04 During the ‘60s & ’70s, the United States supplied Iran with an arsenal of sophisticated weapons. In what must seem a cruel irony to a later generation, the United States even urged Iran to begin a large-scale nuclear power program to save its abundant oil reserves.

Priceless…
1359 2018-05-02 20:50:57 Someone’s Getting All The Oil On International Politics
1360 2018-05-02 20:50:55 Oak dining room floor restoration.  Full sand, finished with clear Magic Oil by Pallmann.
1361 2018-05-02 20:50:54 Gas was cheaper under Obama, ha ha.  Those are the same greedy companies he's been coddling, and allowing them to ruin our beautiful coastlines with leaky oil platforms everywhere, while he tries to drive solar out of biz.  Wake up Jimmie, stop worshiping Trump, he's no good.
1362 2018-05-02 20:50:53 If you dip bread into balsamic vinegar and oil you're already there.
1363 2018-05-02 20:50:52 Is anyone interested in traditional markets here, especially Widowmaker Mrs. Us oil?
1364 2018-05-02 20:50:43 Everybody want that oil til you got to suffer for it 
1365 2018-05-02 20:50:24 I just bought some oil called Donald Trump , ain’t gon lie that shit smell good

-bathe with castle soaps
-spray rose water mixed with vegetable glycerin 
-moisturize with a body butter I mix or almond oil 
-dab on either two fragrance oils or 1 fragrance oil and a body spray...

It’s an experience lol
1371 2018-05-02 20:49:34 Exfoliate regularly! And rosehip seed oil!

1373 2018-05-02 20:49:16 It amazes me how many 'traditional foods' contain #palmoil. How can it possibly be traditional to have palm oil in Oatcakes, Shortbread, to name but a few. #deforestation
1374 2018-05-02 20:49:08 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
1375 2018-05-02 20:48:56 All I want is some oil money. Some?
1376 2018-05-02 20:48:48 Sorry mate. But that will not be the contract he gets fired for. I hope he doesn’t get fired because that means the oil are good again next year but I have no faith in that.
1377 2018-05-02 20:48:47 Liverpool must win so that Wenger's excuses about oil money get totally nullified.
1378 2018-05-02 20:48:31 That feeling when it's 2018 and you can't decide whether vaping essential oil blends is something you want to get into or not, but remain passively impressed that this is now a thing
1379 2018-05-02 20:48:23 it is caused by excess oil from your hair to ur forehead and face so use less hairfood nd do not moisturize ur weave
1380 2018-05-02 20:48:21 Trump has reduced 2 national monuments in Utah by 2 million acres. He’s instructed Zinke took loook at cutting another 27. The republicans want to open those lands up for oil drilling.
1381 2018-05-02 20:48:10 Hebrew Biafra have to be treated differently. You see they are Hebrews and have oil and mineral resources therefore the British Edomites and their jihadists have to destroy them while the World is silent.
1382 2018-05-02 20:47:53 Half block under the oil tank to keep me warm the next few days...
1383 2018-05-02 20:47:47 Tried the banana Keto Chow today for breakfast (@ketochow). Not bad, but really weird consistency. Maybe I need to try it with avocado oil instead of heavy cream next time.
1384 2018-05-02 20:47:40 For me going to the Dr for my quarterly check up is like the mechanic who changes the oil but also mentions 37 other things wrong w the car: in both cases I walk out saying,"It may be a piece of junk but atleast its still running."
1385 2018-05-02 20:47:29 SURF is back ! This all wahine group researched the sustainability of kukui nut oil. #womeninstem  @ Kapiʻolani Community College
1386 2018-05-02 20:47:14 All food is created and distributed with oil. We could stop eating or are they planning to tax us to death.
1387 2018-05-02 20:47:12 There are no such things as "Chinese soybeans". Like oil, soybeans are fungible throughout the world. Most likely, the Chinese will buy US soybeans through transhippers.
1388 2018-05-02 20:47:08 that's what i was taking! it was definitely rough going off of it but it's been about two months and i'm doing pretty okay. hopefully the CBD oil works well for you!
1389 2018-05-02 20:46:56 How long does it take to get an oil change? Like I swear I’ve been here for 3 hrs already.
1390 2018-05-02 20:46:53 Still believe the reason Oilers made the investment in Koskinen is to see if he can be a starter in 2019-20 & beyond. I'm as big a supporter of Talbot as you'll find but I wouldn't give him anything more than a 2yr deal moving forward and my guess is a 3yr will be his minimum ask
1391 2018-05-02 20:46:43 Tea Tree Oil #BadIceCreamFlavours
1392 2018-05-02 20:46:41 Over the last two weeks, Oil and USDCAD has been rangebound. 1.28 level in USDCAD has been pretty solid. With USDCAD current trading at above 50% range, these guys are anticipating downward pressure on Oil. If my hypothesis is wrong, then USDCAD must be a juicy sell.

1398 2018-05-02 20:46:13 Trump mtg, OBJ saw: the US will continue to reduce purchase of crude oil from Nigeria and there is nothing he can do; the US will export agricultural products to Nigeria & the govt will encourage that; all the killings taking place in Nigeria by herdsmen are being done ....
1399 2018-05-02 20:46:08 These are matters of life-and-death for our country, yet don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.

1425 2018-05-02 20:42:51 I think you meant to refer to subsidies for the TMX verses for the oil and gas industry in general. I don't normally agree with gov't support but I think a penalty to gov't for not dealing with applications on time is reasonable.

1430 2018-05-02 20:42:01 No amount of snake oil or ‘robust’ process can help you at that point.. start with a small team and figure out what works for you. No one should be grabbing onto SAFe as a life raft to compensate for poor planning and prioritisation
1431 2018-05-02 20:41:59 I do wish Enbridge's Northern Gateway went ahead - much easier to support a Canadian company.

Maybe we need a model that includes significant fed/prov ownership of oil & gas infrastructure. Definitely need a model that provides more value to AB gov't!

2) with 300 days of sun / year, the country is one of places dreamed for the solar energy
1446 2018-05-02 20:39:33 Do those areas have oil deposits? If they do there may be a private refinery somewhere. Makeshift. Maybe this was all what BHT/ISWAP was all about.  Black gold. Maybe religious motive was just the moral cause used to justify a scam involving people's lives? Maybe?

1469 2018-05-02 20:36:25 Yes, I know how important the range was for Allied air dominance and the ability to destroy the German's oil fields which nearly brought all mechanized assets an planes to a halt That doesn't change the fact that the Mustang was a dog, near worthless until the Rolls Royce Merlin.
1470 2018-05-02 20:36:16 Sooner than expected, oil revenue will be no more. The future of this great country is in agriculture, tourism and industrialization. I wonder what the people of Ekiti will be living on, by then. You are a failure as a governor. Frying garri is an achievement?

1503 2018-05-02 20:32:18 Just wrong. Did you notice how retail inflation kicked off after the Sterling fall post June 2016 worked through the European supply chain? Dollar value dictates oil and derivatives inc. air travel, petrol. And because of inflation, interest rates are starting to rise.

1533 2018-05-02 20:28:36 We gotta stay in the know about these products my niggas. Especially if you got the facial hair and/or hair outchea. The mango and lime oil is a major  amongst a few others
1534 2018-05-02 20:28:33 Italian sub, American cheese, lettuce, hot peppers, pickles, oil and extra vinegar
1535 2018-05-02 20:28:26 I mean who wouldn't be entertained by a fight featuring a temporarily blinded man armed with a cross that is a machine gun and also a rocket launcher, and an opponent who has a weaponized saxophone that is also a gun?
1536 2018-05-02 20:28:22 Ike predictions coming True after 64 years of telling people what to watch out for. GOP party is doing all the things he was AGAINST.  He mentioned millionaires but now it’s billionaires oil men. Cut social programs, buy politicians,kill labor unions.That I can tell you.  #Butta
1537 2018-05-02 20:28:03 Update: After getting my oil changed, the manager said “you look like you would be a good politician” shortly after asking what my degree was in. Thanks I suppose?

1541 2018-05-02 20:26:56 Only one approval in 9 years is pathetic....Hampered by his stunning lack of vision and leadership, Harper never built a pipeline to the west coast which is vital to Canada’s economic prosperity. Oh the irony that it will be Trudeau that builds a pipeline to free Alberta oil
1542 2018-05-02 20:26:53 @rtenews I’d say oil the wheels on the camera.... or feed the mouse in the news studio! #squeak
1543 2018-05-02 20:26:45 Trigun Maximum is like the Trigun anime if the writer could do whatever he wanted. The plot is darker and more violent, the characters are more developed, and the action is much more creative.

1545 2018-05-02 20:26:42 environment is not being ruined, that is not true, plus of course there is energy independence when you are exploring oilfields, gas fields and exporting natural resources, natural resources are the fundamentals of energy independence, mines, oil and gas, coal, Copper, etc
1546 2018-05-02 20:26:31 It was olive oil and lime 
1547 2018-05-02 20:26:28 Obesity, diabetes, heart issues are costing ‘us’ more and more. Of individuals choose to pay for races, virtual medals or snake oil so what? Good on them for trying to improve and be a better version of themselves.

1549 2018-05-02 20:26:06 Wonder how much the oil companies are paying Trump & gop to ensure the prices skyrocket? We should expect the gas prices to keep going up as long as trump is in office.

1554 2018-05-02 20:25:27 That's good. Lets put crude oil aside.
1555 2018-05-02 20:25:22 bowl mix them with garlic pepper salt (to taste lmao) balsmic vinegar ( if you like sweet can add a dash of honey), olive oil, mix up, put on foil or baking sheet in oven i do 385 or 400 cook about 20-25 mins depending on how crispy then after taking them out
1556 2018-05-02 20:25:21 Like oil it is the cause of a lot of suffering 
1557 2018-05-02 20:25:16 A little olive oil does wonders for my dry hands in the winter

1570 2018-05-02 20:23:06 it's supposed to elicit "OH GOD LOOK HOW MUCH OIL THIS FOUNDATION OOZES INTO YOUR SKIN"
1571 2018-05-02 20:22:49 The "S" and "O" in "SEO" stand for "Snake" and "Oil", respectively
1572 2018-05-02 20:22:41 energy independence is not in Putin's interest, 10 million barrels of oil exported a day is not what Putin and Iran want.
1573 2018-05-02 20:22:10 I got a $50 gift card yesterday & now I'm wondering if I should spoil myself or actually use it wisely like for ex. Groceries? Oil Change?  #Adulting
1574 2018-05-02 20:22:10 Why do you think USDCAD is a lead indicator for Oil, out of interest?

1576 2018-05-02 20:21:29 Ok, wow. Why didn’t I know this. I’ve been complaining about having to mark “White” on census forms for AGES of course it’s about oil
1577 2018-05-02 20:21:23 Just found out the saddest news though, chick fil a cooks with peanut oil and I'm allergic... so guess who can't eat chick fil a anymore?? :(

1587 2018-05-02 20:20:08 They wouldn't know a socket wrench from a torque converter. Hard to restore something when you have never picked up a tool in your life. I doubt that many even know how to add oil to a car. But maybe with manufacturing coming back so will working with hands & tools.

1590 2018-05-02 20:19:49 I disagree. High gas prices & folks tying it together, Alberta moving on wine, gas & oil threats & and a torqued NEB process did enough damage to affect the uneducated or folks who will not be directly affected by an actual spill.
1591 2018-05-02 20:19:45 Great reflection of City before oil money.
1592 2018-05-02 20:19:42 What a convenient round number ! So, #WarCrimes then?

What about the millions of gallons of #oil that was slipped out by "Coalition" oil companies?
1593 2018-05-02 20:19:21 If these pharmacies will be tracked down and cautioned probably punished, I guess it will be commendable, huge sigh of relieve. Cough syrups are to drug vendors what oil is to Nigerian government. The petrodollars, and  codeinaira.

1599 2018-05-02 20:18:49 Do you feel that investor owned utilities are at a greater risk than oil and gas companies?  I would assume that IOCs would invest properly into cyber security whereas utilities have there margins capped by PUCs and thus more likely to under invest.
1600 2018-05-02 20:18:40 We already made a decision as a country. Crude Oil inapigwa kodi kubwa baada ya huu mwaka wa pesa. Kuhusu semi refined inabidi ilipe kodi sitahiki.

1608 2018-05-02 20:17:49 Hey guys, so if you're battling with acne and you have oily skin, most people advice you not to apply lotion or oil cos it makes the acne worse.
Brethren, that's a big fat lie, moisturising keeps the acne away!!! 
You honestly dont need too much to get rid of acne.

1614 2018-05-02 20:16:38 Concerning? Precarious? It's just a high volatility chop. Growth is steady, earnings strong, Fed not hawkish, inflation likely to subside due to the base effect of oil prices, Trade Wars overblown, and the Infrastructure Plan still incoming. Concerning was at the end of January.

1616 2018-05-02 20:15:53 Emma. I’m afraid there is an urban legend - perhaps rural legend would be more appropriate - going round that Fatsia japonica is the castor oil plant. It is very similar in form to Ricinus communis (castor oil plant), which is were the poison Ricin comes from.

1624 2018-05-02 20:15:18 Dreamt I was a NY Times reporter who just landed a big scoop against a shady oil company. Looks like I forgot to write the story before this morning’s news reel. Sorry guys.

1633 2018-05-02 20:13:24 Ghee isnt usually eaten as is...never has been...we use it to cook with. Nothing like homemade ghee for high heat cooking when butter cant be used and seed oil shouldnt be used. Tarka dhal with ghee is unbeatable.
1634 2018-05-02 20:13:24 Just like the mass of our planet is ridiculously large compared to the size of humans but we found ways to still hurt it with overpopulation, pollution, oil spills, nuclear weapons, extinctions, etc. Just saying, humans always find a way. Even when it's not the intent.

1640 2018-05-02 20:12:44 Why not just bathe in oil then? It's probably slightly more healthy.
1641 2018-05-02 20:12:32 There are natural remedies that should help including tea containing baldrian or orange blossom, as well as capsules- they rarely touched my sleep issues though. There are those stones that you can put an oil on ( no candles to worry about. #MHChat

1672 2018-05-02 20:09:28 No, its more or less an hydrocarbon on its own. Almost like crude oil

1675 2018-05-02 20:08:52 And yet a barrel of oil is still the same price. So why the spike in fuel prices?
1676 2018-05-02 20:08:43 Ya know what I hate, those fucking people at the airport who buy an apple and proceed to chomp on it at the gate. Olive Oil and her fucking Red Delicious.
1677 2018-05-02 20:08:43 They're made of oil.
1678 2018-05-02 20:08:34 The fact that I work 6 days a week and wanna get my nails done, hair cut, get an oil change, wash my car, go grocery shopping and clean my apartment all in one day <<<

1682 2018-05-02 20:08:19 It is time that we get serious about hybrid/electric vehicles or go completely electric.  @realDonaldTrump lives in the past looking to oil and coal as the future.  Limit resource are short-sighted.  Renewable energy is what is needed!
1683 2018-05-02 20:07:52 cooking oil has hit a new low
1684 2018-05-02 20:07:03 Oh, nothing. Just thinking about the things you can do with melted coconut oil. Lol.
1685 2018-05-02 20:06:56 Look Shell Oil under water, not a Deep Water Horizon, but environmental consequences just the same.
1686 2018-05-02 20:06:53 make sure you brush ur hair kids otherwise it’ll go matted, you’ll have a breakdown, threaten to cut it all off and ur best mate will have to rub coconut oil in it for half an hour to get rid of the knots
1687 2018-05-02 20:06:43 Sound Good to me. Just a bit rare the mix of butter and oil but, who knows maybe you found I new way. Next time come to L'Escala and we can eat all together.
1688 2018-05-02 20:06:42 As long as my car got gas, oil and 4 wheels I will never move on your time. 
1689 2018-05-02 20:06:31 Coconut oil?
1690 2018-05-02 20:06:14 nah. i learned from the guys in belgium that do legit frites. let the frozen shits defrost some (not mushy, but almost), soak 'em in olive oil & toss with sea salt & bake. PERFECT.
1691 2018-05-02 20:06:04 @realDonaldTrump allowing Wall Street to buy all the crude oil causing highest prices in 4 yrs. ENEMY OF THE MIDDLE CLASS! Tax savings gone!
1692 2018-05-02 20:05:34 We're a net exporter of petroleum. When oil is half of what it was the last gas prices hit this level, something is very wrong.
1693 2018-05-02 20:05:34 Yes when replaced done a full service again genuine parts and when purchasing full service kit got oil free which was good  and oil and filter done again after static regen

1700 2018-05-02 20:04:42 In India women used to make their own oils from beans using 2 circular stones that would grind and crush the beans until this amazing oil poured out. I want one of those stone grinders. Someone should market those in US. Otherwise just buy cold-pressed oils at WF or Amazon. Easy.
1701 2018-05-02 20:04:21 Little late on this, but wanted to comment on Shane's point about DOE picking non-fossil winners early in Obama yrs. Good to remember that DOE was making decisions in context of oil at $140/barrel and gas prices in excess of $12/mmBtu.
1702 2018-05-02 20:04:14 Using the correct grade low ash oil?
1703 2018-05-02 20:04:08 Today’s simple. OIL algo is the same as the SPX algo. Pop and fade like an asshole.

1706 2018-05-02 20:03:57 More proof our top officials are for sale to lobbyists and foreign countries. Pruitt is proving that the EPA under trump is for sale to oil and coal industries regardless of country. They are putting profit above the lives of Americans and the world to increase the net worth.
1707 2018-05-02 20:03:45 So the banksters of wall street are blaming the oil price rise on Trump’s mixed messages on Iran?
Hey asswipes gas prices have gone up over a dollar a gallon since this illigitimate POS hijacked the white white house.

1713 2018-05-02 20:03:25 I feel like I shouldn’t be eating a plate of chips while watch #britainsfatfight. They’re homemade and without oil if that at all makes it better.
1714 2018-05-02 20:03:24 Does essential oil "think" they're essential ? Who knows. Does essential oils "think" this is a pathetic similey ? Absolute !
1715 2018-05-02 20:03:23 I feel like they forced your character to swallow oil and the face now makes it  look like they're choking on it.
1716 2018-05-02 20:03:13 @AliVelshi The Demand for oil is driving the Cost of oil go up bc we don't invest in Solar & Wind- Oil don't want to lose any Profit at anyone else's cost! time to make it harder to profit off oil-
1717 2018-05-02 20:03:04 Great. Thx to @realDonaldTrump for his stand re Iran, gas prices are climbing. I don’t hear u saying anything about oil prices.

1724 2018-05-02 20:02:22 @MSNBC The rise in oil price also helps Trump's bff Putin a ton or two.  A record amount of gasoline use also proves that Trump's unemployment numbers are a bunch of crap with people driving around during the day, are unemployed and NOT WORKING!!!

1780 2018-05-02 19:55:19 so both men aint just want oil?
1781 2018-05-02 19:55:06 Also considering the horrendous damage from Oil then surely this is a step in the right direction?
1782 2018-05-02 19:54:59 If you have oily skin, maybe u could try using blotting sheets to pick up some excess oil before using setting powder? I do that bc my makeup sometimes makes my face look more oily after putting it on and if you take off some excess beforehand then you use less product afterwards
1783 2018-05-02 19:54:59 The cost for a barrel of oil is lower than ever... but it costs Vancouverites $1.70 per litre at the pump? How does this even happen?

1785 2018-05-02 19:54:08 I see some are suggesting the Raptors should've used their bench more narrative after last night.

1790 2018-05-02 19:53:43 yeah, beer hops is ok, any other is ok too. you freeze them, then batter them to get the powder out of it. Then pour 100C olive oil over it and let it sediment. you can repeat the process a few times, the first batch is ok to eat the others work well on topicals and such

1816 2018-05-02 19:51:20 I just ordered CBD oil for myself a week ago — still waiting for it.  I have awful, chronic sleep issues which NOTHING seems to touch. We’ll see how that goes. I am hoping hoping hoping.
1817 2018-05-02 19:50:40 @RitaSofiale put the olive oil on your dresser
1818 2018-05-02 19:50:40 Trumptards will say us prez has nothing to do with gas prices WRONG When the largest oil consumption country talks about droping oil going to clean OPEC has 2 choices raise prices intill it's over or drop prices bankrupt clean energy THANKS TRUMP
1819 2018-05-02 19:50:35 Literally just reheat them in the oven. Don't add any oil or sauce bc that will make them too soggy. The fries already have enough oil for the next time they are cooked
1820 2018-05-02 19:50:29 Aaaand to QP. Kenney up - under what conditions would the gvt propose to slow shipments of oil to BC? Notley: I've been clear that after Bill 12 passes, we'll use the resources we can #ableg
1821 2018-05-02 19:50:27 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
1822 2018-05-02 19:50:22 Every time Repubs get in office, we get these ridiculous car gas and oil hikes in prices! It is no coincidence! What about all those deregulations and corporate tax breaks to help us little people?
1823 2018-05-02 19:50:18 The oil of the future
1824 2018-05-02 19:50:15 Here’s an assumption I’ve made that I’m now questioning: is there a market for oil sands oil?
1825 2018-05-02 19:50:12 This nigga ain’t stopped talking and they pose to be changing my oil
1826 2018-05-02 19:49:57 Solar oil
1827 2018-05-02 19:49:50 Not me either. Our local takeaway loves to use PLENTY of oil! Ergcccch
1828 2018-05-02 19:49:36 Jettas are nice n all until you have to get a $90 oil change. Or a repair. Or a part. Or a vw shop. Or a mechanic.
1829 2018-05-02 19:49:33 Wanna join my free crude oil give away
1830 2018-05-02 19:49:03 Seriously Tony did you listen to Mole Valley Councilors lack of knowledge on the subject of Brockham Oil Field. It truly shocking.  I am stunned . Unbelievable ! Really cringe worthy watching.

1832 2018-05-02 19:48:50 Bush and Blair have done worse in the name of 'war on terrorism / oil... the Israelis too are always killing innocent Palestines yet they are accusing peaceful Iran of lying to the world...
1833 2018-05-02 19:48:38 #IslamicRepublicNotIRAN
The Mullahs in Iran are exact copy of ISIS. if they reach nuclear bomb no one can live in the world. avoid this by supporting real people repressed in Iran by not buying oil and put the regime under heavy sanction.  i am living here regime is to fall soon
1834 2018-05-02 19:48:34 Correct.  Cotton was the oil of its day.  Speculation in cotton financed the textile industry and (later) machine shops, etc.  Without the free labor of chattel slavery the industrial revolution would not have been profitable to the financiers of the time.
1835 2018-05-02 19:48:29 Let me guess, it has nothing to do with clean coal, oil... 
1836 2018-05-02 19:48:16 How can a country blessed with oil cursed with bad leader .@PSRPNigeria @FMPWH if only we refined our oil here ,it might be easy to power our country.
1837 2018-05-02 19:47:32 yes but its all about oil and Saudi has it and the west need it but their will come a time when oil is no longer needed for fuel and Saudi and the middle east will become deserts again but way after i have died i think
1838 2018-05-02 19:47:19 Your soothing facial oil, a must for bedtime

1840 2018-05-02 19:47:13 We have it in for my Grandma when she comes cause she likes it & the doctor said peppermint oil would help my stomach, thought I’d give it a go...

Never again. My Grandma is a heathen for wanting that stuff.
1841 2018-05-02 19:47:13 oil then, and probably now too
1842 2018-05-02 19:47:10 highly suggest using hemp oil of some kind to roll your natural leaf blunts bc they don’t stick like reg wraps
1843 2018-05-02 19:46:56 They’re awful, but I honestly think they’re selling snake oil.
1844 2018-05-02 19:46:40 Why did it continue long after north sea oil ceased to be significant in our economy? Why is the rest of Europe so bouyant?
1845 2018-05-02 19:46:38 coconut oil, maple syrup, sprinkle some cayenne pepper. throw them hoes in the oven n toast em. 
1846 2018-05-02 19:46:31 English motherfucker. Speak it. The US Army killed Avicci As they thought he was hiding oil. #FreedomWorldTour
1847 2018-05-02 19:46:23 Not the oil barons suffering then?  Surprise, eh?
1848 2018-05-02 19:46:20 House Finance has advanced HB 331, the oil tax credit bonding bill, to the House floor. They JUST got a legal memo from the AG on the constitutionality of the bonding. Now House floor bells are ringing. #akleg
1849 2018-05-02 19:46:18 Apple sauce is a great substitute for oil in *certain recipes, in my opinion. (Like banana bread!)

1855 2018-05-02 19:45:24 I'm getting my oil changed and shit, be there soon!
1856 2018-05-02 19:45:19 My skin is very, very, very oily, basically bathe in an oil bath then splash some more on as the day progresses, and also extremely sensitive except for all the stuff that it's not sensitive to.
1857 2018-05-02 19:45:18 Not a skin care people but I have pretty pretty princess skin--I use a baking soda scrub, rinse with water, and then a dilute vinegar rinse, and another water rinse. A coconut oil/sugar scrub is nice, too, or coconut oil /baking soda.
1858 2018-05-02 19:45:11 To what is in the public record, he needs to release that if he expects American consent for ANOTHER war in the middle east. By the way, this war would be for oil, not nuclear weapons. It's actually never been proven. Iran had a nuclear program, only alleged by west govt
1859 2018-05-02 19:45:10 I like how you changed it from Making sure nfkrz hasn't dies to making sure he hasn't drowned in cooking oil.
1860 2018-05-02 19:45:07 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1861 2018-05-02 19:45:05 That's a shame. I can only do it if I am continuously practising over a period of time. Otherwise Lavender oil. Activity and steam/sauna. Shower before bed helps me. Bet you vectored all those though. I often have a cup of tea 3-4 pm!and watch TV then settle down again. Good luck
1862 2018-05-02 19:45:04 The only time I want a man is when something on my car needs to be fixed... hunny go change my oil hunny go change my tire etc etc other than that I don’t want you niggas 
1863 2018-05-02 19:45:03 Where is it not already $3? Also what happened to all that oil we are drilling?
1864 2018-05-02 19:45:01 Lol white ppl be smashing up and blending any type of beans with oil and calling it hummus. Literally had a "black bean hummus" that tasted like my abuelitas frijoles.
1865 2018-05-02 19:44:56 And now it all comes clear. The empire want more territory, more oil, more control.
Disgusting how American thinks it can go decode how tiger countries are run.
Wake up America, England. The world doesn’t want you carving it up for yourselves.
1866 2018-05-02 19:44:47 A similar accident occurred 4 days ago involving a Libyan air force (40 yrs+) C-130 when more than one of its engines reportedly failed soon after T/off  from Shararah oil field located 30 miles w of Ubary-Libya resulting in 4 fatalities (Flt crew)
1867 2018-05-02 19:44:41 A bath or shower at bedtime with the warm or hot water would definitely help especially, a bath- when I was in clinic I could have a bath in the evening with an essential oil or simply a bubble bath. Made all the difference on a restless night. I had tried so many things #MHCHAT
1868 2018-05-02 19:44:28 lol. The illiterate who was cutting multi million $$ oil deals in the 70s and built 2 functional refineries. Where and what were their fathers doing in the 70s?
1869 2018-05-02 19:44:24 Thought the oil had ran out 
1870 2018-05-02 19:44:20 Whatever happened to baby steps? Like: 

1. Afford food
2. Get a roof over your head (<-- I'm here)
3. Be able to afford filling up your gas tank
4. Oil changes, no longer a luxury 

Ect...
1871 2018-05-02 19:44:08 Sooner or later people are going to have to accept that the oil boom is not coming back. Ever. We can build pipelines that circumvent the globe. That won’t raise the price of oil. People waiting for those jobs to come back may need to adjust plans.
1872 2018-05-02 19:44:06 Got a Oil Change just to find out I need a new tire... When can I have a break on Spending

1876 2018-05-02 19:43:31 Globally economic recovery is an indication that crude oil prices is on its way up and won't recede anytime soon. How high? Think $100 to $150 per bbl is too high? Unless more producers come on board, it is almost inevitable.
1877 2018-05-02 19:43:24 Remember old days in Cuba when due to lack of oil supply, mode of transport by mule carts became a norm.
1878 2018-05-02 19:43:22 Ughhh I can’t eat there anymore they taste different and all that oil makes me wanna vomit 
1879 2018-05-02 19:43:18 One of the best sandwiches in the city is hiding in a cafe in logan. La Strada Cafe on California. (Italian 9” with provolone, oil+vin, onion and lettuce, no mayo/mustard.)
1880 2018-05-02 19:43:16 I agree. I just like making the point of these countries, particularly #SaudiArabia and #Oman, have enough #petrodollars to feed the next 20 generations of their people today... even without another drop of oil pumped out. Problem is bad ruler's. #Foodinsecurity is a symptom.
1881 2018-05-02 19:43:05 Also, a war involving Israel, the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and Iran will result in a complete disruption of oil export traffic through the Persian Gulf; and when 40% of the world's total oil supply is compromised, that means a global economic meltdown....

1884 2018-05-02 19:42:27 In my tiny home town here in East Texas oil was king. For years people could make a great living with little education working in the fields.  That died. Drilling moved on. The old timers that control the politics still cling to it. Town is dying because of it.  1)

1886 2018-05-02 19:42:16 Saltfish souse- boil to lessen salt, then add finely chopped  tomatoes, onion, pepper, *ackee, celery, then douse the souse in coconut oil. Can be sautéed or not, either way Hella yummy
1887 2018-05-02 19:42:13 Every tablespoon of butter or oil you use in a recipe adds around 100 calories. That may not sound like a lot, but just 100 extra calories a day can translate into 10 unwanted pounds over a year.
1888 2018-05-02 19:42:02 Otherwise, I use any shampoo that has lots of good oils in it like argan, avocado, or moroccan oil. And I don't use conditioner bc if you're using a good quality shampoo you shouldn't need it. It weighs my hair down too much!
1889 2018-05-02 19:41:57 This picture is quality. Would look great in an oil painting #Qualitymanagement #Alps
1890 2018-05-02 19:41:40 Fair enough. But how is oil’s future looking? Pretty bleak and all the revenue has gone.
1891 2018-05-02 19:41:39 Honestly what i do is boil potatoes then fry them in little oil to get a crust then add sausages/bacon, scallion, mayo/sour cream, diced onions, cilantro (preference), diced bell peppers, seasoning, chili flakes/powder (depending on spice level), garlic
1892 2018-05-02 19:41:20 Cooking oil, long life milk, tinned veg and instant noodles! Pretty please :)

1899 2018-05-02 19:40:38 I make my own that seems to work well: 2 tbs white sugar, drizzle in a small amount of honey to make it paste-texture. Then a drop or two of lemon juice. Scrub face, rinse. Few times a month. I may try adding olive oil, as well.

1918 2018-05-02 19:38:57 Look up your car model online or the manual, check to see what kind of oil it takes, and go from there. Mine takes strictly synthetic oil so I can actually get a good 7-9k miles with mine before it needs to be changed.

1929 2018-05-02 19:37:19 Some of us desperately want the Oilers to succeed but refusing to recognize repeated stupidity by Oil management doesn't make you a better fan. It is being foolish

1931 2018-05-02 19:37:08 When your boyfriend facetimes you off guard when youve just put coconut oil in your hair and slicked it back, taken your makeup off and caked yourself in moisturizer. The first words i hear when the camera turns on.....

1940 2018-05-02 19:36:21 Was the oil changed right before you got it? If not it wouldn’t hurt to get that done, and get your tires rotated/air filter checked as well.
1941 2018-05-02 19:36:10 Getting my oil changed and I keep hearing problem after problem with my car. 1 more year and I can upgrade to a big girl car with my big girl pay check! #staypatient
1942 2018-05-02 19:36:07 Cool! Maybe I’ll have to make some room for the new version  do you do oil changes?

1951 2018-05-02 19:34:58 Talk of Open Data vs “Data is the new oil.” Wrong. Data is Infrastructure. It needs to be maintained, we have rights to it, and responsibilities to it. This makes more sense for how to share and use data. #calitp18
1952 2018-05-02 19:34:53 Honestly think it’s just the oil. Gave me a bit of a scare though.
1953 2018-05-02 19:34:41 That’s just coconut oil and conditioning.. I’m trying to get my shit to grow out.

1959 2018-05-02 19:33:08 Conservatives and Russians own the oil companies. They don't need any reason to raise the prices, which are artificially low anyway.

1978 2018-05-02 19:30:43 You could also look for oil stains. Hybrids have those messy machines that drop oil everywhere.
1979 2018-05-02 19:30:36 LOL the market is definitely bipolar. Buy on hype, sell on or before the news is king. "Sell in May and go away" may be true this year. Midterm election year, rising oil / US dollar, inflation, tariffs, recession, triangle formation. That's it, putting money under the mattress.

1988 2018-05-02 19:29:17 Me too. As soon as oil prices go above $100 per barrel again, people in Cadillac Escalades will whine that the Arabs and the EPA are bankrupting them.

1990 2018-05-02 19:28:52 this argument is very similar to "peak oil" argument.  Most likely will turn out to be false alarm. IMHO

2000 2018-05-02 19:27:51 Cold process is simple. 
Put everything in deep freeze the day before. This causes a lot of the plant compounds, such as chlorophyll to stay in the plant.
Leaving an oil that is much more golden.

Explosions for processing are 98% butane related. Ventilation is crucial.
2001 2018-05-02 19:27:41 Keith we really want to hear what Vivian has found thru her diligent research. It’s important that Canadians are aware of the corruption in our governments and oil/gas development. I would think you could garner a large audience on this topic. C’mon Keith, it’s important!

2009 2018-05-02 19:26:24 Here's a thought .... Canada has the 3rd largest oil reserves in the world.   Perhaps we could find a way (pipelines??) to exploit this valuable resource which would bring in billions of dollars of revenue for the federal gov't.   ......... nah ... too easy!

2020 2018-05-02 19:24:48 Oil follows the laws of gravity. Sometimes you can't see where a leak is coming from because the actual point of leakage is hidden. Sometimes the only way to confirm is removal of the actual component.
2021 2018-05-02 19:24:37 i was too scared to use a stovetop until over 2 yrs ago KLJDGSK and anytime i accidentally use the wrong oil that i think is gonna catch on fire i flip out and just give up

2027 2018-05-02 19:23:27 It takes a lot more time to make coal reserves, oil reserves, barrier reefs and ice caps than it does to make people. Like, if we lose half the population, that's still 3.8 billion people left. That's PLENTY.

2040 2018-05-02 19:21:50 I think we've been doing decently under the Sask Party. Our economic performance hasn't been bad, and the negatives are coming from factors outside of our control (potash and oil prices).

I believe strongly in protecting the environment. I just doubt a new tax will do that.
2041 2018-05-02 19:21:46 Reality is tragic: Damned few dissenters are not on oil dole. Those who are not, tend to be nasty people. 

Same tactics against climate scientists now that Tobacco Institute used against health scientists decades ago (and still do). It’s not coincidence, doesn’t help knowledge.

2043 2018-05-02 19:21:41 @FlintshireCC out of curiosity, how do we recycle cooking oil? Does it go to the tip?
2044 2018-05-02 19:21:09 Right. Let's invest in more pipelines to pollute the planet. Great idea. 
The oil sands are still some of the dirtiest oil on the planet and, oh wait, that's right it was the Conservatives that got that ball rolling. 

But really, who needs a future, right?

2048 2018-05-02 19:20:56 Of course, the actual funding dollars for the parks would come from a budget funded solely with “voluntary” contributions by the oil companies doing the drilling. No government funds will be used toward park maintenance!

4. Every considered the massive impact of extracting the oil for plastics?

2094 2018-05-02 19:14:25 I went to Richard's exhibit at the Cooper art gallery and my mum wouldn't let me inquire about buying the oil painting of Dan Jarvis and this is the negativity i deal with on a daily basis
2095 2018-05-02 19:14:19 Kinder Morgan reported 82 pipeline leaks! Northern Alberta had a major leak this year, the cleanup of the massive Saskatchewan leak is still in the courts as oil companies refuse to accept responsibility,  Keystone leaked! Nothing safe about pipelines!
2096 2018-05-02 19:14:16 There is a tin in everything /

2100 2018-05-02 19:13:47 There was no African identity, humans were no different from the oil we sell today. Slavery has been the business since ancient times, remove your 21st century human rights emotions from the equation.
2101 2018-05-02 19:13:40 I totally agree you, but I bet you dis present crop of politicians in Nigeria won't bend to our yearnings easily, U know why?

2106 2018-05-02 19:12:30 I just watched Jamie Oliver use olive oil in a pudding. If that’s not commitment to your brand then I don’t know what is.
2107 2018-05-02 19:12:27 I can’t stand millionaire Jill Stein, who is using the Green Party for self promotion. Her portfolio shows big pharm, big oil & other evil things.

2112 2018-05-02 19:12:00 Price of solar/storage falling 20% per year and getting better. Oil price wants to go up. Eventually they cross. (they are crossing now) When the tipping point hits, change happens FAST!. Years not decades. When it happens Tesla is THERE!
2113 2018-05-02 19:11:59 Nestlé is opposed to deforestation in all parts of the world. We’ve identified some issues with one of our palm oil suppliers in Papua, Indonesia. If we find deficiencies in terms of supplier compliance with our standards, we will take action – potentially including suspension.

2115 2018-05-02 19:11:49 Why not start releasing these pioneering systems that reduce reliance on fossil fuels? We need cleaner energy now.  No point holding it back until all the oil runs out. Earth is currently our only option...not Mars or the Moon or Uranus!

2117 2018-05-02 19:11:42 Taking my car to a mechanic to change the oil and rotate tires makes me feel like I’m adulting. (I’m not adulting because I’m like 12)
2118 2018-05-02 19:11:33 Especially now that they've discovered that vegetable oil is no better and in some cases worse for you than animal fat

We're not even talking about fish oil. What if those outcomes studies work?

2140 2018-05-02 19:08:26 I'm looking at a website for a company that designs 'alternative energy systems for oil and gas facilities' omg this is so funny. Just what we need - environmentally friendly energy solutions to power the equipment we're using to literally frack fossil fuels from the Earth lmao
2141 2018-05-02 19:08:26 How is a country that gave 99% of its Oil to Standard Oil in 1930 socialist? Do y'all just believe whatever Fox news tells you?
2142 2018-05-02 19:08:26 that's what i've been switched to re ldl-- approaching pesca keto (more fish and nonstarchy veg, evoo, less butter, no coconut oil). haven't done a lipid panel recently
2143 2018-05-02 19:08:23 If a large company wants to buy a house, there's oil under it.

Always know your own value and don't let anyone exploit you or your talents for their own personal gain.

2155 2018-05-02 19:06:24 Nah, selling oil and natural gas is what the "elite" use to accumulate wealth. Oh, and tax breaks.
2156 2018-05-02 19:06:24 Attempting to explain that to someone who doesn’t know that the oil prevents the noodles from sticking together; you risk an in-comprehensive discussion resulting with no further familiarity.
2157 2018-05-02 19:06:17 I used some oil to break the curls down but still

2187 2018-05-02 19:02:55 Also the oil price crash presented an opportunity for the fossil fuel industry to cut 3/4s of employees wages almost in half.

Good night everyone.
2237 2018-05-02 18:55:50 Hi Dr Trish OFlynn, Mars is committed to sourcing fully sustainable and traceable palm oil that's free from deforestation. We're engaging with Arma regarding Greenpeace's allegations. As a supplier to Mars, we expect them to comply with our deforestation and palm oil policies.
2238 2018-05-02 18:55:47 Wish I could stay on longer, but got to get ready to take the car down for an oil change and then there is the lack of a smart phone...
2239 2018-05-02 18:55:42 Well some think striping out the 70's with associated oil issues takes away any relationship that may be implied by leaving that period in.

2241 2018-05-02 18:55:40 Europeans owe thanks to @JustinTrudeau, @cathmckenna, and the Canadian people for taking action on oil & gas climate pollution, while President Trump tries (and fails) to drag the US backwards.
2242 2018-05-02 18:55:33 Got you with that hot oil
2243 2018-05-02 18:55:31 This MUST be stopped. The Great Lakes are going to be our greatest natural resource at some point. More precious than gold (or oil) that's for sure! What do we do?
2244 2018-05-02 18:55:29 Brought my baby oil to the pool cause ya girl is trying to get dark and a girl sitting near by asked if she could use some and me being nice said yes and this girl brought it over to her friends so that the 4 of them could use it. Bitch...... wyd....

2248 2018-05-02 18:55:07 I walked to jimmy Johns to get chips (obvi not a sandwich cause their meat tastes like water) and their fucking chips are made with peanut oil!!!!!! I knew this place sucked
2249 2018-05-02 18:55:07 Nope. Norwegians are more heavily taxed so they saved rather than used their oil windfall to reduce taxes, as Alberta did. The Heritage Trust Fund hasn't received any funds since the late 80s. The AB Conservatives propped up their fantasy AB Advantage using HTF income.

2253 2018-05-02 18:54:37 So many people want electric cars to fail. The auto companies, oil companies, after market tuners, racing enthusiasts, petrol heads, etc are all so heavily invested in the ICE-age that the BEV future terrifies them. Tesla is still on track for 2020 profits as planned.
2254 2018-05-02 18:54:36 #OOTT these guys or the companies who hire them do not realize just like they can spread fake stories ..there are folks who are tracking them and accumulating evidence against them. Why do you think that 'Andurand' clown deleted his tweets?:)
2255 2018-05-02 18:54:36 Thank you!!!!!! I just stay to shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie, some eco styler and some grapeseed oil...keep it simple lol
2256 2018-05-02 18:54:31 plus my mom put olive oil, vinegar and salt on the bread.  I think it has something to do with slowing down the "sugar" dump. They were doing that since Roman times.
2257 2018-05-02 18:54:26 Lol - they ALL voted for tax cuts for their wealthy donors, Oil, corporations that caused the funding crisis.  Their solutions aren’t to reinstate those tax cuts, but rather raise taxes on gas, etc which increases the tax for middle, poor classes. This isn’t just about ed funding
2258 2018-05-02 18:54:24 Bjp modi is collecting money for 2019 by oil prices
2259 2018-05-02 18:54:23 Spilled an entire jar of coconut oil on our nice couch last night and today it's like brand new. Thanks baking soda 
2260 2018-05-02 18:54:21 Oil and water doesn’t mix well; yet, the combination is necessary when boiling a pot of noodles.
2261 2018-05-02 18:54:08 Oil rigs look cool.
2262 2018-05-02 18:53:47 Normal economics fails to explain the movement of crude oil. Market is rigged hence the opportunities are big.
2263 2018-05-02 18:53:39 But it's so nice to have a government that works for more than JUST oil and gas .
2264 2018-05-02 18:53:21 Kaolin clay, French green clay, coconut oil, and more waiting to be turned into skin smoothing wonderfulness!
2265 2018-05-02 18:53:20 Oil dry was the team
2266 2018-05-02 18:52:56 You can acknowledge its reach & influence & still recognize that its pure hot garbage peddling snake oil to the gullible.
2267 2018-05-02 18:52:49 There’s a lack of them, actually. If you’re looking for lacking for oil lobbyists - those are all over the place.
2268 2018-05-02 18:52:43 Alex is always miles ahead of everyone in selling snake oil and placebos.
2269 2018-05-02 18:52:34 Any idea how many oil tankers are 12 miles off our coast at any given time daily ?  Oil refineries just other side of border ? Fuel barged to Vancouver Island ? It is your protest that is weak as is NDP propped up by Weaver.
2270 2018-05-02 18:52:34 Saudi Arabia produces over 10 million barrels of oil a day  #mindblowing
2271 2018-05-02 18:52:34 Exp grinds are the most time-consuming part of the requirements. If you have high enough level ships, you can probably get away with doing 1:3 and save a bit of oil if you picked a carrier or a destroyer,
2272 2018-05-02 18:52:32 1.22 Trillion Naira crude oil sales for 2017 was enough for Nigeria Government to pay every citizen at leat 50,000 naira monthly allowance

2279 2018-05-02 18:51:37 Yep just the green babe, for oiling i use olive oil hairfood mixed with castor oil. For plaiting i do it lets say on a monday untie them on sunday for washing no special plaiting
2280 2018-05-02 18:51:32 Wanting to ban muslims. Wanting to kill terrorists families, and steal other countries' oil. Who even knows how many people we're killing right now.
And Kim Jong Un as fed people to dogs, ffs. Peace in that region would be great, but no Nobel for either.
2281 2018-05-02 18:51:28 Would you Pay $500 to advertise a Free CBD Oil Opportunity -- that will bring you $1000 a month?
2282 2018-05-02 18:51:23 Traditionally, pasta was made by hand.  It was made every day, because it did not keep well. It was impossible to eat too much of it because it was labor intensive, plus mixed with lots of fresh vegetables, herbs and meat. Plus loads of olive oil high in saturated fat.
2283 2018-05-02 18:51:22 Also you don’t have to use a lot — a quarter sized amount of almond oil and 2 drops of tea tree oil should be enough. Maybe a tad bit more of almond oil and 1-2 more drops of tea tree if you feel like your scalp isn’t being fully covered. It should literally work in minutes
2284 2018-05-02 18:51:22 Norway has alot of oil , if alberta broke away from canada it would be 3 times richer .
2285 2018-05-02 18:51:21 My answer when ppl ask my secret kegels and coconut oil 
2286 2018-05-02 18:51:19 Remember reading Alaska most polluted state from gold mining,oil. Will there be war on which nation gets 2 claim oil rights in the North Pole? Push now is for higher oil prices which means more profit & more fracking. Only consolation those who run the corps will suffer same fate

2316 2018-05-02 18:47:52 No, it's a digital painting! I should've probably specified... Although, if I get the chance I really want to try oil painting.
2317 2018-05-02 18:47:49 I totally agree Sen. We need elected executives that have the capacity to create wealth and not just spend oil money: spending is easy

2328 2018-05-02 18:46:13 I remember when bragging about cracking an oil pan was cool. In all reality it means “Idk how to drive a lowered vehicle because I’m impaired”

2340 2018-05-02 18:44:50 Oil & Gas is the foundation of the modern world.  I, for one, am not the least bit interested in returning to pre-modern revolution days where only the elitist of the elite have the every day luxuries most of enjoy today. ie: central heating, imported food in the winter etc...

2349 2018-05-02 18:43:25 Brain didnt function, so I was like "better cool the oil with water before dumping it". 

You know, just lack of using my head for a second.

2353 2018-05-02 18:43:15 or that fuel is higher in Scotland , where it has no power over it , nor on its taxation , and ironically when talking petrol , diesel and gas had its oil fields stolen from it.

2357 2018-05-02 18:42:17 Many farmers own at least a .22 rifle for pest control. Jurisdictions that prohibit discharging firearms within their borders often exempt farms for that very reason.

(And if the Feds would get some damn pipelines built maybe oil wouldn't hog the rails so much.)
2358 2018-05-02 18:42:17 Just another snake oil salesman. I wish I would cheer for this man. Im voting for lifelong Democrats, not for republican using democrat as a  convenience to get elected.

2360 2018-05-02 18:42:02 Really messy reaction,  2 things stand out:  Slight dollar weakening = Instant crude oil bid;  and yield curve trying to steepen .
2361 2018-05-02 18:41:57 I’m thinking about taking on some pet commissions! The issue is they’re oil paintings and take quite a bit time to pricing is high.
2362 2018-05-02 18:41:56 Don't touch them... Hang out. We could see some volitility in oil but that shouldn't matter. Correlation between oil and mlps should drop off. Price of oil does not matter for most companies.

2365 2018-05-02 18:41:48 Great idea. I’ve tried various ways and like to turn the asparagus over in a little olive oil and salt to lightly coat it, then cook on a hot griddle pan. Works well...

2368 2018-05-02 18:41:17 "You dey give?"
"Can you oil my piston"
"Do you get down"
2369 2018-05-02 18:41:12 Oil doesn’t seem to trade on logic 3/4 of the time. Periodically, it realizes the narrative it was using is unsupportable and corrects sharply. We are in the 3/4 phase, though it is getting fatigued. That moment of realization is not far.
2370 2018-05-02 18:41:12 If rising oil prices start to push Russia's economy in the right direction again, will Trump adjust sanctions so that their effects are not negated? 3/

2373 2018-05-02 18:40:59 If she’s pouring oil over your car windscreen it needs to be dealt with regardless of age or physical health. That’s in no way reasonable or normal behaviour. But you will first need to get evidence
2374 2018-05-02 18:40:59 It seems strange to say I'm dreaming of popcorn tonight - but when you drizzle it with @PomoraGoodFood truffle oil, black pepper and Parmegiano-Reggiano, maybe you can see why! 
2375 2018-05-02 18:40:54 Why we do what we do ''Hi Tom, getting more confidence with my trading. I took a small trade off the slightly negative comments on the fed statement from squawk. I paired it with cad as oil was rising too, nearly took Aud too with gold rising but still tentative now I'm live''

2402 2018-05-02 18:37:56 There is soap, cream , body glow oil,beard oil. Choose

2408 2018-05-02 18:36:50 Yes I almost cried blood when Jonathan mortgaged our future with the Malibu oil deal scam. With Dasuki $2billion scam,NNPC scams, (Dizeani) . Mind you the Malibu oil block was worth over 60 times what it was sold... and we didn’t even get to see the $1.2billion sef. It was shared
2409 2018-05-02 18:36:43 Can also depend on what kind of oil your car uses. My car uses fully synthetic so my oil changes are usually around $50
2410 2018-05-02 18:36:35 This is not in reply to your recent tweet. My concern is the out of control price of fuel. The American people are being raped. The production cost of oil is $9 per barrel. The stock market has nothing to do with the cost of production. Any money gained thru tax savings is lost.
2411 2018-05-02 18:36:28 Females love togo get oil changes and ignore the fact they car lackin every other liquid it need lol
2412 2018-05-02 18:36:17 1. roast veges! cauliflower, potatoes, carrots, zucchini, peppers etc, chopped to the same size, toss in oil, season (salt + oregano, rosemary, & cumin if you're feeling fancy), roast at 400*F for 20-30mins/until golden. Double your amount & have half /w greens = salad leftovers

2417 2018-05-02 18:36:01 set aside culture -- car sales seem to really fall when oil price fell, and the cost of driving a heavier less fuel efficient vehicle fell
2418 2018-05-02 18:35:56 Wasn’t the plan! Israel was created by UN vote and almost disappeared is few weeks later!

British were protecting oil fields..

2435 2018-05-02 18:33:39 not to mention the whole problem with seismic testing searching for oil which is making mammals go deaf and scaring off the fish.

Hey Valerie, I work at a place where they test for drug use,which is fine. But I was recently tested and my test came up positive. I told employer I drink hemp tea, that several of us here use hemp products hemp seed oil, tea,shampoo, etc. I was suspended. Not fair
2438 2018-05-02 18:33:18 Like clockwork, they know what to post to control trends. They know what to post to get a reaction frm ppl who are pawns in this economy. No, slavery didnt end because it was wrong, it ended because it wasn’t profitable for the North’s oil interests. Human bodies dont need petrol

2441 2018-05-02 18:33:13 My brudda do I know? All I know is shit need replacing when the tires flat, when the AC not working, when the oil needs changing. Imbeciles 
2442 2018-05-02 18:32:59 r u kidding me? you do realize there are fish throughout the ocean? that its how the scientists say, "an ecosystem." as of yet I don't think the fish have fenced themselves off into little fish hotels so that our oil buddies can move in.
2443 2018-05-02 18:32:48 What admits more carbon foot print the thousands of diesel trains moving all the oil right now or a pipe line ?

2446 2018-05-02 18:31:47 I worried that responding to this thread would result in having to answer that question. But… why be shy? In the shower, only with water; I use soap (not bar soap,  it shaving foam) on my chops before/after shaving; and then apply body oil/moisturizer. Judge me as you will.
2447 2018-05-02 18:31:46 If it's not oil with a dash of spaghetti, it is soggy spaghetti you'd throw away or asun that would give you headache. I miss home, abeg.

2451 2018-05-02 18:31:32 hey Jonathan, thanks for answering this. Just a quick question if you don't mind. What is the difference between an non-sealed Sacred Oil (currently account bound), and a Sacred Vial? Are they not identical?

2479 2018-05-02 18:28:09 You don't necessarily need to be intelligent, since it takes wisdom to see when someone is selling snake oil.
2480 2018-05-02 18:28:03 Lightly oil each side (or the grill) and you will be fine.

4 brand new tires, an oil change, $360.00 & 2 HOURS later…

I’m leaving Walmart…bewildered, betrayed & slightly defeated.

Stick a fork in me because I am done for the day.
2484 2018-05-02 18:27:13 I drove my car off the lot with 12 miles and an existing oil leak. Apparently that’s how @Honda @HondaCustSvc builds their cars? And I’m supposed to trust my 36K warranty will be long enough...
2485 2018-05-02 18:27:04 Eucalyptus essential oil can kill your cat
2486 2018-05-02 18:26:59 Also look at getting mct oil. It's kinda pricey, but it'll get you in the keto zone real quick and give you more energy during the day.
2487 2018-05-02 18:26:58 The catalan recipe is to rub some garlic on toasted bread piece, then rub a special small sweet tomato called "tomaquet de penjar", and then the anchovie with some olive oil. Some add roasted red pepper. Delicious. But of course, gastronomy is creative.
2488 2018-05-02 18:26:57 Hoping @gtbank isn't into drilling oil now. The way the network is going down these days...
2489 2018-05-02 18:26:54 Not true. Oil is up $0.64/BBL today. Get your facts correct. Pretty obvious you have no idea what is going on in the oil markets.
2490 2018-05-02 18:26:53 Please note Canada’s emissions do not include the emissions from burning the oil it exports - which I regard as the biggest problem
2491 2018-05-02 18:26:43 One of liar and theirs first orders was to eliminate Obamas regulation on global corruption on oil and gas. My state prices for gas this time last yr was 220per gallon, now 299 slated to go to 4 per gallon this summer

2501 2018-05-02 18:25:07 In a world where oil is broadly replaced by renewable energy or some other alternative, is it possible oil prices are higher due to reduced supply?

2505 2018-05-02 18:24:34 I dont't understand why it's so difficult understanding that xrp was not born to replace current legal currencies, but it was born to improve, as a tool or engin's oil, cross border payments through instant liquidity... it's akward this common and general misunderstanding..
2506 2018-05-02 18:24:28 Afternoon sis waiting on my oil change for car now then work, how's your day
2507 2018-05-02 18:24:25 Of course, US-puppet-government. All Iraq oilfields are “sold” to US-companies. 

Their obvious plan is to do the same with Al-Omar and Tanak oil fields. 

I hope they fail miserably.
2508 2018-05-02 18:24:09 how else will the SNP balance the budget,....oil?
2509 2018-05-02 18:23:54 $70 oil change I need a Honda or Toyota
2510 2018-05-02 18:23:52 I like the dedication above passenger door...classy
2511 2018-05-02 18:23:52 I know but what about fiscal deficit? Low price of crude oil helped govt to decrease fiscal deficit. You didn't get it. And UPA govt spent 8.6 lakh cr in fuel subsidy.why should it not paid back when crude oil is low?Jab mahnga tha tab udhar lia. sasta hua to kiska baap chukayega
2512 2018-05-02 18:23:50 What’s your favorite product made from oil and gas?
2513 2018-05-02 18:23:48 Many reasons: 1) I would like to see technological progress and one of the ways is finding alternatives to oil, which has spillover benefits as well 2) political economy around oil is terrible--it is the Devil's excrement, 3) high oil prices are bad for India!!!!
2514 2018-05-02 18:23:39 Now you take their oil.
2515 2018-05-02 18:23:38 4 months free supply of Patooty’s oil for this video.
2516 2018-05-02 18:23:35 MCT oil is to bowel movements as KY Jelly is to anal.
2517 2018-05-02 18:23:33 Even oil rags cost more than that.
2518 2018-05-02 18:23:26 If oil goes watch $IO and $EC...
2519 2018-05-02 18:23:24 It kinda hurt inside to fork over $250 to get my car fixed, inspected, and have the oil changed...fuck, adulting sucks.

2522 2018-05-02 18:22:44 Thank you Kayleen. Hope you didn't have to hang around too long for your oil change.
2523 2018-05-02 18:22:38 I think about this all the time, just imagine the guy who discovered baby oil
2524 2018-05-02 18:22:27 I've never understood why athletes are never allowed to show emotions when winning a medal is involved. Last time I checked, being disappointed with not achieving your goal is acceptable.

2526 2018-05-02 18:22:21 Goes to my dad's to change the oil in my truck, gets drafted into helping him build a wood shed from scratch. Wut
2527 2018-05-02 18:21:54 I hate that getting an oil change takes for ever 
2528 2018-05-02 18:21:48 I totally agree, the United States for example should have had alternative fuels instead of using oil many years ago. I'm hoping one day soon all modes of transportation will be electric. So much cleaner and quieter.
2529 2018-05-02 18:21:28 Im just not into this crap.  If you want to learn stuff, have it implemented in your specific group.  JoJo will learn to cook and change oil in a car.  But I don’t want her  doing camping overnights with boys.  This is not going to end well.  I promise you that.
2530 2018-05-02 18:21:05 Kim posts,
I am looking at ordering some pure CBD oil without the thc in it from Australia, does anyone know of where a good place is it get this from? Thank you
2531 2018-05-02 18:20:51 It really depends on the head. There is no right or wrong answer; you just have to test it.

My favorite for massages are sweet almond oil and Jamaican black castor oil (almond is the antinflammatory one). I add a bit of tea tree oil to it sometimes if I’m seeing dandruff
2532 2018-05-02 18:20:39 I put CBD oil on my back and now I feel like I can kill god

But I have an oil change at 3 :(
2535 2018-05-02 18:20:00 Brooooo how long does a oil change take
2536 2018-05-02 18:19:50 Don’t get out the anointing oil yet.
2537 2018-05-02 18:19:26 "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [#EPA, #ScottPruitt] has granted a *financial hardship* waiver to an oil refinery owned by *billionaire* #CarlIcahn, a former adviser to President Donald #Trump."

That sentence completely blows my mind.
2538 2018-05-02 18:19:17 Just suddenly remembered how obsessed I was with peak oil in my early 20s and I’m still cringing
2539 2018-05-02 18:19:10 $CL_F rally this week failed to break above the previous peak at 69.57 and it dropped in 5 waves into a FLAT structure #Oil #Elliottwave
2540 2018-05-02 18:19:04 I get so confused sometimes.. some naturals say don’t put anything on your scalp...but you are onto something. Which oil is your fav so I can cop it
2541 2018-05-02 18:19:01 Forests are the lungs of the world. Fell them all at your peril. They say palm oil is healthier than hydrogenated vegetable oil? How healthy will it be when we can’t breathe anymore, because all the forests have been destroyed for palm oil???

2546 2018-05-02 18:18:33 Oil sands are a huge economic driver in Canada & efforts to diversify have failed to rise up as any kind of replacement. While all climate change efforts are valid & important, it’d really be economic malfeasance to ignore such a large part of the Canadian economy. #hardproblems
2547 2018-05-02 18:18:18 This makes pretty little sense. My statement is coherent, and pretty clearly based in reality. Jones is a literal snake oil salesmen who side hustles completely unfounded conspiracy theories.
2548 2018-05-02 18:18:12 Pour hot oil on the skin after you take it out of the oven @mattymatheson did this with his porchetta
2549 2018-05-02 18:17:57 oil / gas is worth less than 5% of Canada's GDP in #Alberta it did not lead the way in employment and it certainly does not in BC. =get your stats  before criticizing mine!
2550 2018-05-02 18:17:48 Tea tree oil makes me cry
2551 2018-05-02 18:17:45 Call me crazy, but I swear my skin looks significantly better after just one application of this tea tree oil cream
2552 2018-05-02 18:17:40 I have the right combinations of cream and essential oil to soften it
2553 2018-05-02 18:17:30 @Lindss_tastic and @KaiDavisPoet are both #relationshipgoals  and #BlackExcellence and you can’t change my mind! I met them in person and they smell like coconut oil and heaven!
2554 2018-05-02 18:17:27 U.S. domestic crude oil production over the last month rose to 10.6 million barrels per day, 14.1% higher than the production rate a year ago. The U.S. presently consumes around 18 million barrels of crude per day. Can we really become a net exporter of crude in the coming years?
2555 2018-05-02 18:17:14 baby oil
2556 2018-05-02 18:17:01 You're so welcome! I'm not so sure about the non-peanut butter ones  I had also made hazelnut chocolate fudge cups, but realized they'd probs melt in transit  (stupid coconut oil!)
2557 2018-05-02 18:16:46 Every side has their extremists. AJ is a loose cannon who pushes snake oil. He is not a reliable person to be aligned with.  Candace---a little bit of good advice is a valuable thing.
2558 2018-05-02 18:16:36 Got my car's oil changed this morning and it only took me waking up hours before I normally do and 3 cups of coffee to feel like I didn't wake up early
2559 2018-05-02 18:16:21 You mean fracking? The very thing Russia hates us doing because oil n gas are Russia's biggest resources and only thing floating their economy?

Odd how liberal policies seem to be to the benefit of our enemies time and again?
2560 2018-05-02 18:16:15 @olgaNYC1211 during the campaign, didn't someone report about Trump getting a cut in the Russian oil deal that exon(Tillerson) negotiated with Putin but was halted due to sanctions (magnisky?) Trump drops sanctions n gets his cut. It's always the money
2561 2018-05-02 18:16:13 I know more or less what Cuba has done, if true, but it's peanuts compared to hundreds of millions in crude oil. For example, let's say the eye treatment costs $500 to $1000 per case, and they did 50,000 in 2005. That's $25-50 million. If I were Cuba I'd take that deal everyday!
2562 2018-05-02 18:16:10 Yazi...i can't........"bb oil"
2563 2018-05-02 18:16:10 California has oil too, call your reps up and tell them to start drilling. 
2564 2018-05-02 18:16:10 England's biggest export to Nigeria is refined petrol and diesel,much of it is originally from Nigerian crude oil.
2565 2018-05-02 18:15:59 how many guys does it take to do an oil change? apparently 3, and an hour and 15 minutes
2566 2018-05-02 18:15:50 I have no doubt that Nigerians will surely benefit from it. The government is desperately in need of money to find some of its infrastructural projects bearing in mind the relative drop in revenue-- especially that of oil. The stolen funds come in handy.

2577 2018-05-02 18:14:45 True, also its important to remember that these countries weren’t always big state welfare countries. Sweden for example used to have lower taxes than the USA till the 1950s. Also Norway has a economy hugely dependant of oil. We don’t really know what would happen to welfare th

2584 2018-05-02 18:14:19 This is absolutely criminal, price-fixing at its best. Should be investigated! Gas used to always be based on the cost of crude oil per barrel, which has remained stable. No reason for the variance.

2605 2018-05-02 18:11:58 Quite the opposite really. Contrary to prevailing opinions, you actually need to be fairly smart and fairly healthy to serve in the military.

And if the US wanted oil it would be way cheaper to just buy it rather than mess around with a war, no?

2607 2018-05-02 18:11:47 We used to use warm compress and massage oil into the area to warm and help stretch the skin. Most won't do that anymore because of this same argument. Too many tipping women are claiming it akin to rape. Without doing that, the tearing is actually worse.
2608 2018-05-02 18:11:46 How did you notice? When u changed the oil?
2609 2018-05-02 18:11:36 Has anyone checked to see if there is oil there??
2610 2018-05-02 18:11:20 Yeah, I hear from a lot of people who still fear saturated fats while they chow down on veggie oil laden processed junk.

2615 2018-05-02 18:10:57 Once meats thawed, hit the whole thing with just sea salt, then put it on a cooling rack and into the fridge for say 3-12 hours. Salt will absorb into the meat and create some awesome flavor. I usually take it out, hit it with some olive oil and rub then onto the grill.

2639 2018-05-02 18:08:47 Never get the air filter changed during your oil change - you probably don't need it and, if you do, you can get one way cheaper and do it yourself for a fraction of the cost.

2640 2018-05-02 18:08:45 Surely to actual fuck a child health expert would then be asked who is more of a health hazard to Scottish weans, a box, or a Tory?

Nhs cuts, staving weans, rape clause, reducing the age of consent to 12, de indutrialising Scotland while stealing its oil, fracking, sanctions.
2641 2018-05-02 18:08:26 you should try to rub tomato on the bread, put some olive oil and anchovies on top. nothing more

2644 2018-05-02 18:08:22 Don’t Worry,  the people that we are dealing with are Hypocrites. There are more cars there then the rest of BC. They Take Ferries that burn more full in a day then the rest of BC, the in the ocean, they take money from Oil and Gas like they deserve it.
2645 2018-05-02 18:08:15 Hopefully you will finally realize within the next few years oil/coal will be the death of the planet,move all investments into renewable energy ASAP.
2646 2018-05-02 18:08:02 Don't know why I thought it was cool to put coconut oil on in this heat. Not a gd idea.

2655 2018-05-02 18:07:03 Been living a better life since switching to tea tree oil shampoo
2656 2018-05-02 18:06:49 Got an oil change, re-mulched the yard and put out our spring/summer stuff and bought some flowers... all before 2:00 
2657 2018-05-02 18:06:48 I have one. Covered in oil paint .
2658 2018-05-02 18:06:46 Dirty filthy life-ending oil.  Disgusting stuff.  I've been recycling, re-using and reducing my garbage for years.  Solar, wind, water, and geothermal are the way of the future.  Cheeto is pushing us backwards and doing things to prevent the survival of all living things!
2659 2018-05-02 18:06:43 oil on them 
2660 2018-05-02 18:06:40 It doesn’t have benzoyl peroxide, it’s a retinoid but it’s even more drying. So yeah I’ve had to go back to using a heavier moisturizer that used to make me oily and even that one isn’t enough for me now I need a new one  on the bright side my face isn’t an oil slick anymore

2664 2018-05-02 18:06:17 No o.. it's anal oil.
2665 2018-05-02 18:06:15 you forgot oil
2666 2018-05-02 18:06:03 It's a cool day in Phoenix.  Earlier, I had thunder showers for brief time.  So lovely.

The windows are open.  

In the past fifteen minutes, the breezes have brought in the scents of grilling meat & BBQ, dryer sheets, pollen (sneezes), fried chicken, motor oil and roof tar.

2684 2018-05-02 18:04:20 Things to do while waiting for an oil change:

1. Read/delete emails
2. Look at memes
3. Try to guess who drives what
4. Tweet about things to do while waiting for an oil change
2685 2018-05-02 18:04:19 Woh this looks awesome.. like monsterclay. Is it oil based or water based?

2692 2018-05-02 18:03:29 Yes, that part about them being underground was completely unbelievable, all I could think was how come no one drilling for oil hadn't hit one.

2697 2018-05-02 18:02:59 All NL needs to support one another in our shared prosperity and transition to a low carbon economy.

2700 2018-05-02 18:02:43 I gotta try that because I actually have tea tree oil
2701 2018-05-02 18:02:40 The oil price is so high actually! Brainwashed noob 
2702 2018-05-02 18:02:39 Totally agree with that.  Even if we didn’t have a CO2 problem,  that would be smart because Europe wouldn’t be held hostage by Russian natural gas and we wouldn’t be fighting wars in the Middle East to maintain oil.
2703 2018-05-02 18:02:24 Peppermint and tea tree oil baths are heavenly
2704 2018-05-02 18:02:17 Yeah, he was fine. My mother suggested her "go to" - Mineral Oil.
Of course we couldn't use Turpentine (what I used for cleaning up my paints & brushes.
Mom always swore by Mineral Oil on her skin & it was safe on the cat! BUT, just dabs on a cloth, rub, wipe off well!
2705 2018-05-02 18:02:16 I have an idea. But if data is the new oil, why not tax net giants on the use of customers' data? #bitsoil is the most valuable aspect of the new digital economy

2711 2018-05-02 18:01:34 Well to help minimize the breakout I would recommend, apple cider vinegar (with water) and tea tree oil. Works fast!
2712 2018-05-02 18:01:30 So here you go I will tell #OPEC @OPECSecretariat and @DUBAI that take Western Texas Intermediate and Brent Crude Oil in whichever bank you like. Short a lot and loose on purpose. You took all our money once, bring it. #CrudeOil

2714 2018-05-02 18:01:25 And oil change. And all the parts that would probably just fall off of Blaze on the ride. If she made it I’d be shocked
2715 2018-05-02 18:01:21 There's no dairy anything in Mayo. (it's basically vegetable oil, eggs, vinegar, lemon juice, sugar and salt) That said, the Hellmann's vegan mayo isn't bad.
2716 2018-05-02 18:01:20 Fun fact: Because of new oil heating efficiency, houses are using 25% less oil each winter than they did in 1989!

2722 2018-05-02 18:01:02 Cool. Peanut butter provides the smell the dogs love and yams/pumpkin are really good for Vit. A and healthy fiber. Some flax seed or other high omega acid oil is great for the coat as are the eggs.
2723 2018-05-02 18:00:55 unfortunately lot of hype , just saw a 82 y.o lady who was forced to take Rick Simpson oil by her kids ( for well controlled breast ca) causing her to fall .Luckily no fracture. Lot of alt- info in the net. Adding an element of conspiracy theory sells..

2746 2018-05-02 17:57:31 First of all quit calling them fossil fuels-they aren't fossils at all but high carbon fuels. "Fossil" was a term used to make them seem limited therefore eligible for a depletion allowance. Thank the Rockefellers and Standard Oil for that. They are always (1)

2751 2018-05-02 17:56:50 Thank you! I’ve done tea tree oil (only for a few days tho), and I’ve done sea salt soaks and I’ve done pastes but nothing has worked.
I’ve even put toothpaste overnight lmao and it was only reducing its size and appearance but then it’d grow back.
2752 2018-05-02 17:56:47 I don't understand how anything smelling like wet cardboard and made from coconut oil and other stuff can be called cheese. I really, really wanted to love avos - but meh. Also they get mashed with/stuck on things I really do like which is just not right.

2757 2018-05-02 17:56:13 I know here in TX is goes between 19.99 up to 180 depending on where you go the oil used and the amount of oil your vehicle takes.

2760 2018-05-02 17:55:56 u defend progressive ideologies therefor fake feminism which is NOT about equal rights. Then why no outcry for women in Iran? Saudi Arabia? Raif Badawi? Why no outcry for multiple of tankers importing saudi oil to canada? hypocrisy runs deep! Your Evidence is propaganda btw
2761 2018-05-02 17:55:56 Not surprised...And why isn't a carbon tax applied to imported oil? #cdnpoli #cdnecon #ClimateAction
2762 2018-05-02 17:55:54 1) Cool
2) No, it's not silly, actually. Especially when said platform is nothing but low level, amateur snake oil hucksterism meant to enrich the coffers of a mediocre shill preying on the vulnerable and paranoid.
3) Anyone can say those words. You don't have to heed them.

2775 2018-05-02 17:53:01 Why is an oil change $49 in Colorado .... in Michigan they do this shits for $19.99
2776 2018-05-02 17:52:57 I see a lot of products made from oil in that picture mikey boy? How you getting to Seattle? Walking? Jogging? Bicycle? Or by plane or car? Probably plane or car I’m guessing. You hypocrite
2777 2018-05-02 17:52:47 In 1930 one farmer fed ten people. By 1980 it was 75 people, mostly due to oil. (Tractors, fertilizers, irrigation pumps...)

2785 2018-05-02 17:51:41 @UTPresidentJoe So you're willing to sell your integrity for a stake in the oil business or nah? Worst mistake UTK ever made was bringing you in, but dont worry, you'll get double crossed too. You friggin' people are an embarrassment to Tennessee.

2788 2018-05-02 17:51:28 You know how obvious it is to never put water in a pan filled with Oil heated at 180° Celsius ? 

Yeah, it is pretty obvious, yet i actually did it.
This was a stupid mistake, no clue how i managed. 

Need to make it clear, none of us is hurt or anything, not at all really.

2816 2018-05-02 17:48:00 And those jobs are in decline because of automation and other price-driven efficiencies. The oil industry is not expecting $100 oil and is consolidating and driving down costs. I see that US oil reserves are up again...

2914 2018-05-02 17:34:53 I said a year ago , when oil was $40 a barrel and gas was over a dollar a litre how much will it cost when its $100 a barrel “again” . Well it’s just over half way there and look at the price already. Can’t wait for the carbon tax to add another 11 cents a litre.
2915 2018-05-02 17:34:46 Getting an oil change is never pleasant. Like stop trying to charge me for more expensive things, and tell me all these things wrong with my car that don’t make sense.
2916 2018-05-02 17:34:40 I put this raspberry tanning oil on my butt now all these bees flying around my ass

2926 2018-05-02 17:33:34 Slovakia's prime minister tried on Wednesday to distance his government from media reports that Vietnamese agents used a Slovak government plane to smuggle home a former oil executive they kidnapped in Germany last year.

2939 2018-05-02 17:32:10 @JustinTrudeau why can't Canada build our own oil refineries? Employment,  lower gas prices...
2940 2018-05-02 17:32:05 tea tree oil face/body wash, jojoba oil, and rose water every day. my skin is always flourishing 
2941 2018-05-02 17:31:58 Of course you won't turn your back on the world. Above all you need oil. Let's be great. Let's invade some countries...

2945 2018-05-02 17:31:26 I watched the game and it did feel like the classic Raptors can’t get over the hump against Lebron.  Giving up the lead, leaking oil,   A non review on an elbow to the face of Derozan...   they had chances late in OT but the bounces didn’t go their way!  They are right there tho!
2946 2018-05-02 17:31:23 It happened to standard oil it could happen again!
2947 2018-05-02 17:31:14 Oil boom is all fun and games until we paying 3 dollars a gallon for some gas

2949 2018-05-02 17:30:50 Thanks to @JustinTrudeau, @cathmckenna, and our neighbors to the North for taking action on oil & gas climate pollution
2950 2018-05-02 17:30:45 This is troubling if true. Kind of negates our image of being the most regulated oil industry in the world.

2953 2018-05-02 17:30:24 Lol!! I got you boo! My products were actually Wet N Wild and elf so nothing fancy at all. My face wash is Pacifica and I moisturize with grapeseed oil. I have oily skin for reference 
2954 2018-05-02 17:30:17 Ok, good gesture.  Take note, when at a Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Burger King, Abe’s Oil Shop,....BUY something.  All stores do not allow anyone to just sit there and use the toilet.  These two idiots could of just bought a single cup of coffee.  Case CLOSED.
2955 2018-05-02 17:29:59 A good economy helps the value of peso to go up against the dollar. We do not produce oil & we are buying it with dollars. If oil costs $100/barrel  in 2016 it will only cost us 4,400 pesos compared now it's P5,200 per barrel. Are you not surprised how gas prices so high now?

2963 2018-05-02 17:29:10 read studies just yesterday describing how tarsands projects only provide jobs during construction, the best deposits are already in production. So big economic impact relies on endless & large expansion, not currently supported by oil market.

2972 2018-05-02 17:28:12 @ScottMGimple I find myself hoping you are planning an anthology series for TWD 8-10 ep limited series that involves different environments, time in apocalypse (maybe even way future) or early woodbury or oil platform or alaska or WH when things blow up? could be much fun!!!
2973 2018-05-02 17:28:02 They aren’t afraid of ANYTHING! GOP doesn’t use all the documents anyway, and you don’t read. Sell your snake oil to your “base”. We SEE you donnie dimwit. You are in so deep you’ll need real lawyers that are honest just to cut you a deal. Yikes!
2974 2018-05-02 17:27:58 yeah I don't like this tone. this undercurrent that momo = crooks.
in fact I m tempted to say stories, narratives and snake oil is a lot thicker in value world.
2975 2018-05-02 17:27:45 If true.. good news indeed... keep the price of oil low, this should continue...
2976 2018-05-02 17:27:22 Is it just me or does everything taste better when cooked in coconut oil?

2978 2018-05-02 17:27:06 Yes, people should know the cost the animals and environment pay for palm oil. My hope is people who know the damage done will demand an end to palm oil production.
2979 2018-05-02 17:27:01 US will continue to reduce purchase of crude oil from Nigeria and there is nothing Nigeria under Buhari can do about that.

2983 2018-05-02 17:26:27 Questions about a relation between #Islam and Black Goo
1. Is #Islam a consequence of the supposedly intelligent oil #BlackGoo?
2. Are #Muslims directed by the Black Goo?
3. Does the black stone, the Kaaba, in Mecca contain Black Goo?
2984 2018-05-02 17:26:11 Very true and its dangerous both ways,but people react differently  to pain like you'd find women who'd burn their men with oil cause he cheated or something but im not justify this guy's  action he derseves all the time he could spend in prison,life hopefully.
2985 2018-05-02 17:26:04 Music and a hot shower on CBD oil can perk your mood up.
2986 2018-05-02 17:25:50 .... looks so magical - I thought you could put together a colour palette from this and also see what they were wearing lol I always take oil pastels on a trip - fast + quick for this impatient artist! I also like collage for speed - coloured tissue + gluestick, wheee!

2990 2018-05-02 17:25:42 Green peppers are normally a bit bitter compared with red, orange or yellow but taste a bit before you put in your recipe and maybe oven roast in a little olive oil first to sweeten it up.
2991 2018-05-02 17:25:40 "How much longer will investors support sexist, racist, misogynist, homophobic behavior like it was oil??"
2992 2018-05-02 17:25:36 All in the name of stealing oil.

2994 2018-05-02 17:25:35 Which is sad considering what other past administrations have all tried to do in order to increase their profits. (i.e oil) and have thrown other nations into chaos by affecting their democratic elections and put in puppets to do their bidding. Such is politics.

3000 2018-05-02 17:23:39 It has more to do with this war against Russia because it stands between them and conquering Syria which is rich in oil & gas. The U.K. regime desperately needs an excuse to blame Russia, to demonise it & get public consent to attack it.

3004 2018-05-02 17:23:06 Trump has deregulated more than even Reagan, particularly liberating American energy producers to lead the world in production of oil, natural gas, and ultimately coal. Trump has restrained federal spending, deficits and debt!!!!!!!! How ya like those apples????

3012 2018-05-02 17:21:49 It is all relative the argument often put forward from Unionist in an attempt to defend the scandalous mismanagement of Oil is it is £8 a pint I Norwegians on average 2018 take home £6,132 a month. Even with the higher prices, they are considerably better off
3013 2018-05-02 17:21:45 Listened to one politician live recently and realized oil is very important for success in politics also good upbringing not necessary for success in politics at all!

I want to introduce to you a brand of hemp oil that I have been recommending to my clients for optimal health. Please join me this Thursday.PMB Presentation, Thurs  May 3 7-9pm, 6811 Kenilworth ave 5th Fl Riverdale Md20737
I will have dinner there to purchase
3015 2018-05-02 17:21:41 by the time it shows up in traditional data, it's too late. I'm keeping an eye on yields, primarily. Sustained acceleration above 3% on ten year is a big deal if it occurs. I think it will here soon. Oil, as well, obviously.
3016 2018-05-02 17:21:36 Not because of capitalism! Capitalism will kill you because you’re sitting on oil. Which is worse, a culture with fucked up beliefs, or a system that literally functions as a disease and creates platitudes to convince people it’s a righteous endeavor. That sounds like religion.

Wo to almi mandi ma i kam tha
3018 2018-05-02 17:21:21 This shows how Government can control oil prices. Who is robbed?
The poor voter. His pocket and his vote.
3019 2018-05-02 17:21:18 I’m officially one of those bitches with an essential oil defuser. I’m thriving.
3020 2018-05-02 17:21:17 Be putting to much oil on my feet, sandals slippin nshit 
3021 2018-05-02 17:21:13 O massively increased regulatory burdens, especially on energy, crippling coal and oil, and he  targeted natural gas. Worse yet, he smashed all records on federal spending, deficits and debt. EDUCATE YOURSELF>>
3022 2018-05-02 17:21:06 Not all oil barrels are created equal. They run crudes that offer price advantage (that will go ↑ as shale drilling continues but refiners reach processing limitations) BUT... not very good to produce what the market wants: diesel. Gasoline GLUT in the horizon??
3023 2018-05-02 17:21:05 KG had to lube his thighs with Shea butter, coconut oil and ask forgiveness from the Ancestors to slide those jeans on
3024 2018-05-02 17:21:00 I also love how satisfying oil cleansers are, just like slathering it all over my face hahahah
3025 2018-05-02 17:20:59 Gas is selling high everywhere, including the US.. As I saw on NBC news last evening..It is big oil companies in my opinion, taking advantage of so many issues in news. So they raise prices as know folks will blame anyone but them..
3026 2018-05-02 17:20:54 Again, 1,3,5,10 years does not a history make.  Seems like a big club doesn’t need an oil billionaire spending millions to make them relevant and when they get there can sell out their own stadium.  We can go round and round an you’ll still go back to your ignorance

3040 2018-05-02 17:18:51 I guess large import is due to heavy oil necessary to blend with shale. The problem is that US will keep producing LTO massively while low API will become rare. LTO producers would be very wise hedging as long as the market is not too heavily discounting their products...
3041 2018-05-02 17:18:37 I'm torn on using money from oil drilling on national parks. Like its just so hypocritical. But at the same time, the national parks would actually be getting some much needed cash but ughhhhh oil drilling

He started at the bottom in the oil business in Texas and earned a small fortune. He was elected a representative in the Texas legislature in 1966.

3046 2018-05-02 17:17:44 Weaning myself off of SSRI's is no joke. Last time I tried I had panic attacks every day. This time I'm doing it with CBD oil and have had no panic attacks but I'm still feeling kinda down.
3047 2018-05-02 17:17:43 @HorowitzJason Texas oil money will prove the Clemson AD wrong really quickly
3048 2018-05-02 17:17:29 USA is killing hundreds of thousands of people for fun, for oil and for the weapon industry. CNN, ABC, NYT, Wash. Post and so on are as guilty for this fascism as Democrats and Republicans are. Free the US from their nazi-bastards that give us fake news.

3051 2018-05-02 17:17:15 Liberals appear to have turned the corner on questioning over bullying and harassment allegations in their government. QP has turned to questions about oil spills, aquaculture, and the environment from @NLNDPCaucus #nlpoli
3052 2018-05-02 17:17:14 I use CBD products in the vaping form for reducing inflammation caused by sore, strained muscles in the neck and back. I also use CBD infused salves for the same benefit. One that I would highly recommend is our extra strength CBD oil, here's a 15% off discount code on us

3057 2018-05-02 17:16:40 So I slipped Leticia T Swanson a bulletproof salted caramel coffee this morning. 

She just sent me a text saying I offended her because she let it get cold and now it’s chunky. I guess it’s time to switch to MCT oil. No chunks and better energy and fat benefits.
3058 2018-05-02 17:16:37 Aveeno ultra calm for sensitive skin. Not sure about the oil though. I love it but don't have any right now to check ingredients

3083 2018-05-02 17:14:18 It didn't eliminate it but she said it made it a tiny bit more manageable. She said the oil tasted horrible so she used the capsules
3084 2018-05-02 17:14:17 I believe I am the only marine oil spill expert in Canada who has actively worked to prevent tanker projects from going forward on our beloved west coast.

3090 2018-05-02 17:13:45 People have been asking that for decades, so we really oughta wonder, what does the oil cartel want that no one else must have? Oh right, all the power & lion's share of profit to be made. It's gone on too long now. We have to move away from the destructive power of these fuels.
3091 2018-05-02 17:13:43 Now that looks like a real snake oil salesman!
3092 2018-05-02 17:13:39 Jack's fucked him when they were both covered in oil, gas, grime, dirt, blood- and he's not getting out of this now.

They're more coherent than they used to be- age taking away the sharp edge of the fog.
3093 2018-05-02 17:13:28 You just gotta figure out what’s best for your skin. Do you have oily skin, combination, or dry? Then you go from there. I have dry skin so I literally put like 3 different moisturizers on, a lotion, oil and hyaluronic acid so that my body can grab the moisture from the air.

3099 2018-05-02 17:12:48 Thanks to @JustinTrudeau, @cathmckenna, and Canada for taking action on oil & gas climate pollution, while back home President Trump tries (and fails) to drag the US backward. Reducing methane emissions from oil & gas at no net cost is a win for us all.
3100 2018-05-02 17:12:31 Oil, thank you
3101 2018-05-02 17:12:30 ALRIGHT YALL : I need some skincare tips! My face is just red with breakout that’s have been reoccurring. My fave use to be clear and flawless then acne hit like a truck. My routine : wash my 2xs a day with neutragena oil free and put tea tree oil before bed.
3102 2018-05-02 17:12:10 Think of how much dirt & oil builds up on makeup brushes after each use. Wash them with a brush cleaner often.
3103 2018-05-02 17:12:10 Gerry Rogers says it's time to get back to other issues. She asks about drilling mud spill at Terra Nova oil field last week. She calls for separate safety regulator for offshore. #nlpoli

Wressle which is big... Becomes the bonus asset. A strike at Biscathorpe will send the share orbital. There is oil there, did BP miss the sweetspot? Downdip indicates they did. 40% COS

3106 2018-05-02 17:11:48 I saw he also repped the Deepwater oil rig company that polluted the gulf.  Seems like a more apt comparison as far as clients....  
3107 2018-05-02 17:11:45 CA has more oil in the ground than all of Alaska, but we'll leave it there and import foreign oil so we can feel good about saving the world. That just doesn't seem very intelligent.
3108 2018-05-02 17:11:42 I am talking about corruption, terrible management of PDVSA, expropriation of private property making the country totally dependent of oil. The collapse of global oil prices is due to the stupid idea of OPEC and CHAVEZ to minimize production.
3109 2018-05-02 17:11:29 Here's my request: 
Does anyone know of petroleum free and mineral oil free body lotions? 
I know it's not very important but suddenly the lotions I use with those ingredients are making my skin break out.  Thanks!

But your problem isn't being blind to politics, you just can't recognise that the majority of Scots don't see us as being separate from UK.

How much do you want to bet the EMA hasn’t talked to the FDA for insight and thus talked directly to and received the feedback from the exact people at FDA who thought Eteplirsen was snake oil. 

I think there’s a bias / influence from FDA. We’ll see.

3162 2018-05-02 17:04:17 US went for war because they wanted oil not because they cared about democracy! In fact, the more divisive a country is, the better for the weapons industry led by US.

3168 2018-05-02 17:03:30 The question is why Obama is helping them even if their deal deters them a little? We gave them 1.6 billion in cash & now they are selling oil for billions annually.

Iran is biggest exporter of terror in World. Why give them cash to expand their evil?

3255 2018-05-02 16:53:17 Or are you talking about the oil sands? They’re doing maintenance. However they do this at least twice a year, every year, and gas prices weren’t effected this way. Gas prices are a result of government incompetency and nothing else.

3266 2018-05-02 16:51:49 I'm not sure the season was definitively over at the New Year. If I recall Oil had picked it up for a nice run heading into the holiday break.  Season was not over. Until they crapped the bed for a long streak coming out of the break. Al trade was Jan 4.

3310 2018-05-02 16:47:22 Nah I got that down. My sensors are all fukie and my oil light keeps coming on when my car is idling, looking it up it looks like I have a shitty engine pump thingy but.  Shrug
3311 2018-05-02 16:47:15 I'm pessimistic with the the Saudi Arabian  economy, 90% of her economy rely on crude oil production and the world is seriously abandoning the consumption of crude oil in the bid to fight against global warming.
3312 2018-05-02 16:47:08 @TheJimCornette - RE: your question on today’s podcast... the auto industry went downhill starting with the Oil Embargo, and really hit a low point in the late 70s. (Japanese cars had a much better fuel efficiency.) It started back in the early 80s, but still took a while.
3313 2018-05-02 16:47:03 Hmmmm, you might want to check your understanding of history. Cold War really? lol. Recent wars are about oil and control, but historically they have thwarted evil. Do yourself a favor, stop talking. Your 15 mins of fame has run it's course.

3316 2018-05-02 16:46:42 I have a credit because of an emergency landing we needed to make with one engine as we lost all the oil the other suddenly. Would definitely like to use that $400 but...

3350 2018-05-02 16:43:30 Every Kwph of solar, wind or wave energy reduces oil and gas demand, every self-heating/cooling house, every electric vehicle. Fossil Fuels will die from a death by a billion cuts...
3351 2018-05-02 16:43:29 Then just a really simple moisturiser like Bioderma’s Hydrabio. Days I knew I’d be indoors and wouldn’t wear make up I’d smother my face in Green People rosehip oil and keep topping it up, too!

3356 2018-05-02 16:42:52 Oh yes, opinion as fact is a cancer spreading an ideology of the squeakiest wheel getting the oil. If you reward tantrums they only get worse.
3357 2018-05-02 16:42:48 Surprised you think there is an organized effort to reduce snake oil peddlers or that they have been reduced by anything you see today.

3367 2018-05-02 16:40:56 $OIL's still stuck in the 67-69 range. We've had one fake break to the upside on April 30th above 69, then a fake break-down through 67 yesterday, and another today. Next test of 67 (if we get it) will almost certainly break down to ~66.50, where I'd look to play a bounce

3427 2018-05-02 16:34:19 I love the smell of baby oil. Omg I cannot

3431 2018-05-02 16:34:03 I could put essential oil on my foot and still get it in my eye
3432 2018-05-02 16:34:00 1-Cuando el Rockefeller Center se empezó a construir, en Buenos Aires el edificio Kavanahg ya existía.

Cuando la Standart Oil empezó a construir su primer kilómetro de oleoducto, YPF Argentina tenía 35 Km de oleoductos y 95 pozos para explorar. SIGUE.
3433 2018-05-02 16:34:00 #india needs 30 dollars :) greed itself will kill the oil producers

3436 2018-05-02 16:33:27 @realDonaldTrump Still waiting for a response to why the oil companies are raising gas prices on the people in North Carolina hirer then any other state?
3437 2018-05-02 16:33:26 Adulting is getting an oil change before work & making time for Panera for breakfast.

3440 2018-05-02 16:32:56 Give me a break John. Pipeline capacity is full in Canada. We can’t get any new pipelines built in this country. Naturally the next best option is rail. You add oil to rail it obviously takes up space and as a result agriculture and other sectors suffer for it.
3441 2018-05-02 16:32:51 Frankly speaking I don't like to have to pay for business expenses which is what we have been doing in many ways in AB for oil industry. Subsidization is not the way to encourage business. These companies make enough money and if they aren't profiting why are they in AB? Doubtful

3443 2018-05-02 16:32:37 That country, ever since the 70's oil crisis, has used its new found wealth to spread its many medieval ways throughout the world. We have allowed this to happen because they bankroll the West and own large parts of it.
3444 2018-05-02 16:32:32 Permian producers of oil are making so much money that they flare $300k a month of #NaturalGas at HH prices and about $200k a month at local prices. #Baller #Permian
3445 2018-05-02 16:32:27 Let's all run around with our clothes backward and upside down and eat Lucky Charms three times a day with motor oil poured over it. There's some new ideas. Notice how they don't make me look smarter or right?
3446 2018-05-02 16:32:26 This was the trip to PROMOTE the oil industry right? This is something that does not usually come up for the director of the EPA. Do you suppose he mixed business with pleasure?

3455 2018-05-02 16:31:16 Yes! Well and not surprising. What did Ronny Jackson get for saying Trump could live 200 years, and had amazing genes? Trump's entire public persona is fraudulent. He is snake oil.
3456 2018-05-02 16:31:09 We’re also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents, but don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
3457 2018-05-02 16:31:07 The absence of tags on commodities from Africa is what enabled conflict diamonds, illicit trades in crude oil, etc. The world must battle the grey markets particularly in Asia where these illicit products are mostly sold.

3459 2018-05-02 16:30:50 While it is true that the oil industry provides jobs, taxes, benefits there is also the env liabilities that have been left for 44 years. We will be resp for this expense. Redwater decision allows bankrupt comp to walk. I'm curious how the tailings ponds problem will be fixed.

3465 2018-05-02 16:30:17 @JackPosobiec well he can always put on display the exponential growth in the Clinton Family bank account over the tenure of his pay for play sec of state ... that should take a good chunk of wall space and inspire more than a few awestruck glances and comments....
3466 2018-05-02 16:30:13 This #SlaveryWasAChoice comment #Kanye said the other day. Literally got everybody wild up. Dude got a problem. Not just a FUCKING #Kardashians problem. He got the Devil in him. He need a whole bottle of anointed oil thrown on him.
3467 2018-05-02 16:30:05 My financial situation is so terrible bc at the start of this year I bought a £25 bottle of olive oil and it was just all downhill from there
3468 2018-05-02 16:30:02 The 50th Offshore Technology Conference kicked off in #Houston amid recovering #oil prices — the current price of around $70 a barrel is more than #double its lowest point since the 2014 oil bust.
3469 2018-05-02 16:29:56 Why is price of oil up today with a build of 6+ million barrels of inventory?  What am I missing?
3470 2018-05-02 16:29:54 longtime not touched $oil, will get $gasl if closed above 22 today
3471 2018-05-02 16:29:51 Because they should be separated and not everything is best combined. (You can combine oil and water but it doesn’t work, not everything should or could be combined).
3472 2018-05-02 16:29:43 A ruined country after an incredible oil’s run boom, You can figure out how much they robbed. FMI calculated 1.800.000% inflation for next 2 years.

3475 2018-05-02 16:29:23 im SOOO confused about my research bc on one hand, men r evil and i dont trust them, but also america will villanize anyone that refuses to sell them oil??? so wtf do i even say about hugo chavez in my essay?? like?? how do i feel anymore??? #socialistFeminism
3476 2018-05-02 16:29:22 Actually what he said is a factor. When productivity declines faster than the supply of money, the value of each unit of currency drops. With loss of business, there was less productivity, less non-oil exports and more supply of money via oil profits

I will have to fix the oil pan though as new ones are $89 ;-; Just hoping I can get it to seal right again
3488 2018-05-02 16:27:43 Maybe the answer is to let the money leave and see what's left? I'm sure the strongest companies will survive as there is money to be made in AB. Personally small business needs help more than the oil industry. @OilGasCanada We're struggling. No subsidy for us but oil gets $$$
3489 2018-05-02 16:27:35 Please keep the oil drillers out of our waters and food source. Windmills are a good idea to supply clean renewable energy, put them in the gulf. Stop the cruise ships from dumping at sea, monitor and fine heavily! Blessings

3499 2018-05-02 16:26:27 The government is so poorly run that they can't even get any oil out of the ground, even though they have one of the biggest reserves in the world.   They cant feed their people even though they live in the tropics, don't blame the US for another failed socialist state.

3503 2018-05-02 16:25:47 Sitting at a mechanic waiting on an oil change, and these two guys are complaining because the news talked about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding carriage choice and how sad it is that that bullshit is considered news.

I'm sorry, would you rather see something horrible?
3504 2018-05-02 16:25:36 Coconut oil? That's an odd reaction..
3505 2018-05-02 16:25:36 Where can I find this oil???
3506 2018-05-02 16:25:25 This isn’t rational thought. We all have contributed to AB oil sands development and KM pipeline development through subsidies from fed income tax. There is a pipeline already shipping AB oil - what more do you want besides absolute compliance?
3507 2018-05-02 16:25:01 The entire WH Admin starting at the TOP is nothing more than a pack of grifters & Flim-Flam people selling snake oil of promises to the American people. Can't think of a one who is pure & in it for service of country rather than self serving their interest & lining their coffers.
3508 2018-05-02 16:24:59 I have been involved with high pressure oil and gas pipelines over mountainous and level terrains spanning hundreds of km, including high tech and satellite monitoring and security setup.

3510 2018-05-02 16:24:51 Think he is just referring to the fact that O&G companies still haven't gotten back to the 2016 high even with higher oil prices. Don't see much selling before earnings, just a shallow pull back after a strong rally. Expecting strong earnings from the sector.
3511 2018-05-02 16:24:49 Jesus isn’t better than firmino this season. Going into the World Cup why wouldn’t you start somebody who is playing better. You support an oil money club I understand why your brain works like this

3521 2018-05-02 16:23:54 "The grand corruption of our recent past, that saw billions of dollars frittered away on fraudulent oil deals & bogus military contracts, put paid to all opportunities for an infrastructure revolution. Now we have seized the chance to do things better.”

3522 2018-05-02 16:23:16 Why do you have to lie about the price of oil? Trying to convince yourself?

3525 2018-05-02 16:23:06 Can’t help notice this camp we’re obsessed with the price of oil at $49, they told us it was due to plummet... currently $72 a barrel 
3526 2018-05-02 16:22:58 Capitalism can only work for the half, we simply don’t have the means to provide if all other countries followed suit. Not just oil, but other natural resources such as water and food. Markets may work well when you block out the other half.
3527 2018-05-02 16:22:53 The tricky part is to pass the “process, not product” precedence set by Dolphin-Tuna case. In effect, we need to certify every volume of seed oil (incl domestic grown) according to the same standard

3532 2018-05-02 16:22:24 In my experience many warmists have a straw man argument about people that think that the basis of science is skepticism.  They start by calling them "deniers", then imply  that they are in the pay of oil companies,  (I do work in the oilfield, but that's just my day job ;)   ...

3534 2018-05-02 16:21:42 Natural hair gurus do make you think you need 8 different products in your hair, when in actuality you only need like water, oil, and maybe a leavein.
3535 2018-05-02 16:21:25 The dollar is having a nice rally. You don't see the narrative peddlers saying anything about it. Yet if it were to drop (ala January), there would be no lack of peddlers pushing and bidding oil to the moon. They will be crushed. The vulture truly is a patient bid :)
3536 2018-05-02 16:21:25 Plus I make popcorn at home with actual good stuff (the right oil and seasoning) and it tastes better. I can't make Tagalongs and will buy them every time.
3537 2018-05-02 16:21:16 Yeah, that membrane is something else because you can see the actual tastebuds. Get rid of it lol. It’s really delicate so I would do salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. Cut 1/4 thick and seared in olive oil and butter. Some slider buns and carmelized onions and you’re good

3544 2018-05-02 16:20:40 The rigged system what about this influx on the oil prices for no reason? This hold us the American people hostage! Get a deal made with OPEC better than the one George W Bush let expire with nothing to replace it!

When Confirmation was severed from Baptism & morphed into a rites of passage rather than a public "confirmation" of the baptism that took place in the baptistry, it lost its sacramental meaning.

3568 2018-05-02 16:18:07 Norway sells all their crude oil and gas from North Sea to Europe, America and Canada.
If they are sincere about reducing fossil fuel CO2, why they didn't stop the oil and gas production?
Why didn't #UN pressure Norway & UK to stop North sea production of oil and gas?
Hypocrites!

3589 2018-05-02 16:15:09 This article is interesting, but I wish it included how many millions upon millions of dollars from oil/gas/coal were given in campaign and inauguration donations to Republicans to see why Trump, Pruitt, Zinke,... are pushing dirty fossil fuels.

3591 2018-05-02 16:14:58 Vegetarianism is largely responsible for this. Palm oil is ubiquitous in processed food where it has replaced lard and beef dripping. Oh the irony.

3610 2018-05-02 16:12:14 True and since the deletion of the CWB  (whether it was good or not is another argument) we've had to deal with issues of grain backlogs which further hurt our economy. 
But I believe every budget since 2008 has blindly put oil prices at optimistic $'s instead of actual prices
3611 2018-05-02 16:12:11 I remember one time when I was 7 I was chilling in my friends house and his mum said to stay for dinner. So I did. And she dead ass served boiled pasta with extra virgin olive oil . I went back home and ate curry
3612 2018-05-02 16:12:07 Trump's given BIG OIL permission to fleece Americans. As the deficit grows, expect more of the same as the value of our $$ sinks. All to pay for the 1% ginormous tax scam.

3617 2018-05-02 16:11:48 Feeling very sad and sorry for the death of this young man and for his family. This brave man died for US oil companies and "Operation Iraqi Freedom"is the most bullshit name ever invented.

3626 2018-05-02 16:10:22 World PMI data should fade lower in terms of rate of growth if this can bring oil prices down which then will lead the 10 year yield lower, right straight into an inversion

3628 2018-05-02 16:10:14 Unfortunately, this is for the smokeless form. So who knows how the oil is processed, co2 or butane? 

Second, not only does this bill limit products, but also types of patients, illnesses and age. 

This is an unworkable bill!

These are sold on to factories and smelters for more cash. All other waste is now incinerated. Plastic = oil = energy. Follow the money.

3648 2018-05-02 16:08:35 I believe the theory is that it won't go over $4 per gallon any time soon because Canadian shale oil will become the cheaper option at that point. My point is that the tax cuts didn't really help us because everything is so expensive and going up. That's all...
3649 2018-05-02 16:08:25 try rose hip oil! it’s sososo moisturizing & helped me get rid of all my dry patches, it also helps fade acne scars :-)
3650 2018-05-02 16:08:21 That's a decent enough argument.
We're not because we are a resource-based economy.

3668 2018-05-02 16:06:51 I don't know who you think you're fooling other than Fred, but we need less oil, and to #KeepItInTheGround. The carbon budget of the planet is going to be exceeded if we heed your bad advice, and that means death to most species and billions of people over the coming decades.

3671 2018-05-02 16:06:41 In fact the economic forecast when without oil is good when unpicked and uncoupled . Fear struck to your  bones and kept you entwined, you made it so easy to take and keep. Scotland has such potential on its own .

3674 2018-05-02 16:06:15 And if there is a shortage of oil... the price of oil goes up... and then other alternatives start to make more sense, like electric cars, or rail, or...  See how markets work?  Pretty spiffy, huh?  The world will not end.  Markets will respond.  Life will go on.
3675 2018-05-02 16:06:03 We need to stop depending on oil,  Agriculture could create jobs and push the Economy of the country foward.
3676 2018-05-02 16:06:00 taxation has to be fair -  exported oil gas coal all has to be taxed, no Canadian carbon should pollute tax free -  selling it world wide does nothing to reduce our levels back to what Paris dictates as our goal.

3685 2018-05-02 16:04:56 Let's import it instead on tankers and trains from countries that wage war in women and children! We can't sell them guns without their oil money!

3690 2018-05-02 16:04:13 Bang on my man. He is what he is but it was shoulder to shoulder hit. Wilson never left the ice and the reason he fell back into the bench was b/c both guys braced for the hit. Outcome sucked but doesn't change anything.
3691 2018-05-02 16:04:04 For a year we’ve had to listen to everyone from @SecretaryZinke to @WesternEnergy1 claim that eliminating Bears Ears wasn't about oil/gas/coal/uranium. San Juan County, Utah is now admitting otherwise to the courts

3719 2018-05-02 16:00:59 No, Trump's not doing the scrapping himself. Instead he has a corrupt, lying, wasteful, science denying, complete idiot Trump puppet who's being paid off by big oil, big coal & manufacturing companies & who's completely dismantling the EPA, doing his dirty work for him.

3726 2018-05-02 16:00:16 I was gonna get a full oil change and use a coupon but the guy said he’d give me the price for a basic one just for my “wait”, whic wasn’t even 15 minutes. But hey, I’ll take it.

3731 2018-05-02 16:00:01 Even though the incentive for China to accumulate USD is for oil, how in any way, is Nancy Pelosi & Paul Ryans pork barrel spending a legit proxy for anyone's monetary base ? I agree with you Victor, but I think China still WAY overdid it. Why not go 50/50 UST/gold from the start
3732 2018-05-02 16:00:01 There is a method to their madness. They've been arming Hezbollah to hold parts of Lebanon as protection for the land bridge through to a Syrian port to make shipping the oil that Obama gave them in Iraq easier & to maintain a port on the Mediterranean. Syria & Iran are allies.

3739 2018-05-02 15:59:36 West Coast is further from US than Europe in matters of oil and gas. Also, west coast is exporting Gasoline to MX. Also is the best coast for weed, exported to MX as well #Crude #OOTT  Removing 5.6MMbl P5 build it's decidedly bullish in areas where contracts are settled.

3741 2018-05-02 15:59:22 1. She is the epitome of a cold blooded / greedy politician who will destroy anybody for personal gain. And she sounds like a robot trying to sell me snake oil.

2. Her continuing to whine about losing isn’t “honesty”, it’s further evidence that the election was really about HER

3746 2018-05-02 15:58:26 @realDonaldTrump Now has his war cabinet: Bolton & Pompeo. They are both hawks who are ANTI-IRAN.
War is eminent. Trump will scrap the JPCOA. Why for oil!
Iran will pull out of the entire agreement with @EmmanuelMacron & @AngelaMerkeICDU @theresa_may

3771 2018-05-02 15:54:02 And who is hiring them? Republican businesses mostly. Let ICE raid the oil and gas fields, meat packing plants and Home Depot parking lots. Then you’ll see a lot of McMansion construction come to a screaming halt.

3789 2018-05-02 15:51:59 At best, the @NNPCgroup should be an agency under a ministry of energy and power, which will be responsible for hydrocarbon (petrol, kerosene, diesel, gas), hydroelectric, and other renewable energies exploration, production and distribution monitoring.

3793 2018-05-02 15:51:21 Can you take your team Alberta jersey off for a bit? Most BCers that oppose TMPL wrestle with how this will impact Albertans. Oil isn’t evil - BC already supports AB with the existing line. There is no ill will yet - threats are not helpful.

3797 2018-05-02 15:51:13 Agreed, they are not a trusted ally. Also, I don’t know we got any better than market prices for oil. However, Shiites and Sunnis are poised for a holy war and it’s in our best interests the ensure there is a balance of power in the ME.  So I have no issue with our weapons sales
3798 2018-05-02 15:51:06 I'm curious at your use of "near bankrupted" again, it's complete crap!
Got a link to that info comparing Dubai and Abu Dhabi oil with Scotlands?

3804 2018-05-02 15:50:22 Canola oil and rapeseed oil are separate entities. Canola was derived from plant breeding efforts in rapeseed to reduce erucic acid and glucosinolates. Rapeseed oil does not convert into canola oil by some magical deodorizing process. Misinforming +130k people one day at a time!
3805 2018-05-02 15:50:21 i just, grabbed my hair and dipped it coconut oil,

3808 2018-05-02 15:50:06 I have 0 oil in my car and I’m 7,000 miles past the return date LMAO it’s a good thing I had my friends check it otherwise I would’ve gone a few more months without getting it changed
3809 2018-05-02 15:49:54 Tja, jetzt kommt die Frage zur Definition v. Konkurrenz. Ist z.B. Amazon eine Konkurrenz? Ist Standard Oil eine Konkurrenz? Nein sind Monopole. Intl. Kartellgesetze gibt es nicht !!!! Ähnlich Mafia-Business. Im Bereich Online-Casinos gibt es sowas NOCH nicht. Arbeitsplätze...
3810 2018-05-02 15:49:53 Once the oil is out.
3811 2018-05-02 15:49:52 every time i have coffee with different shit in it (cream, sugar, coconut oil, butter/ghee, cinnamon, etc.) i always come back to my one true love: straight, unadulterated, pure black
3812 2018-05-02 15:49:47 About two barrels of an oil mixture
3813 2018-05-02 15:49:42 About to go ship out more orders, if you want your bottle of Mother's Oil shipped out today, let me know!
3814 2018-05-02 15:49:34 I can do all things through teatree oil, who gives me strength.
3815 2018-05-02 15:49:33 The West has been into perception management ever since George Bush had WMD's created, to create a reason to invade Iraq for oil.
3816 2018-05-02 15:49:26 "We" don't sell anything. Private enterprise makes those decisions. 

And you realize we have oil to tidewater on both coasts already, right? The oil loaded on tankers from the existing TM and all the Nfld oil. 

Oil exports from Canada eclipse imports by about 500%

Get informed

3819 2018-05-02 15:49:15 If you had won independence, then the facts showed after the decline in oil prices you would have been bust, but I do agree it is about oil...
3820 2018-05-02 15:49:13 How do they harvest oil from horse?
3821 2018-05-02 15:49:06 What about the recent fraudulent oil deals going on in ur administration now and all the bogey contracts, is ur admin exempt from them or are they still under past admin,  stop the fucking blame game it's annoying ..
3822 2018-05-02 15:49:03 Thorough analysis this. Again, it backs up the point that @NNPCgroup as an illegal standalone ministry, has been operating as a vehicle for gross theft, and an orchestration of the distribution of our commonwealth amongst a select cabal of friends.
3823 2018-05-02 15:48:52 oil music
3824 2018-05-02 15:48:46 In India governments both at centre and state levels did not allow  consumers get their due.. even when oil prices hovered around 30-50 dollars /barrel in last few years
3825 2018-05-02 15:48:42 Do the people ever think of minimising oil consumption. Please think about the globe.
3826 2018-05-02 15:48:38 I'm ready to try CBD oil for pain. Any tips you can give me will be helpful. I don't think my PCP is thrilled with the idea, but my pain level is between 8 and 9, and I don't want to go back on Oxycodone. Tramadol helps, but not enough.
3827 2018-05-02 15:48:23 but our great leader has made green statements and has said he will tax every Canadian for carbons used.... signed the Paris agreement in Canadas name, took all the accolades, he will save the planet - then permit oil pipelines because only a fool would leave it in the ground
3828 2018-05-02 15:48:16 OMG- to laughable that anyone would believe he has read this or any other book in decades!! He has admitted on several occasions that he could recall a book he has read recently but that his favorite book is the Bible but unable to share ONE verse. Seriously- snake oil salesman.

3831 2018-05-02 15:47:45 Setting my stops on 2650 naked calls. 

I may have been hit on #OIL but spoos is making it back for me

3835 2018-05-02 15:47:11 seriously Andrew,,scots had more oil than abu dhabi and Dubai combined,,yet here we are trillions in debt,,so they HAVE near bankrupted an oil rich UK,,,
3836 2018-05-02 15:47:06 BP profits up 71%, not the price of oil.
3837 2018-05-02 15:47:03 @Eric__Smith Moving forward, still think if the Raptors play a similar game to the opener, make a few more easy put backs, get a much better effort from Poeltl and find a way to incorporate CJ Miles, they will be fine in this series.
3838 2018-05-02 15:46:48 The same way farmers uses futures to hedge their crops .... the same way oil producers use futures to hedge production .... commodity producers use futures to hedge ... no suprise Bitcoin miners do like any other commodity producers out there

3841 2018-05-02 15:46:16 Brilliant and Fox News go together like oil and water.  When you read it, perhaps your base will, as well.  Ha Ha we know you can't read and neither can most of your followers. #25thAmendment

3848 2018-05-02 15:45:55 @Buses_McGills well done to your driver of your X23 service that managed to limp his bus into Glasgow on M8 this morning.  That bus should not have been on the road! Burning smell and not able to get over 20mph! Chalk on side saying check oil 19/4/18! Dangerous! 
3849 2018-05-02 15:45:55 the best trick i've learned is putting a bunch of dry shampoo in your hair at night before bed, instead of the morning. It soaks up all the oil all night and you wake up with fresh locks!
3850 2018-05-02 15:45:46 Bwahahaha. Galawang incrush.
3851 2018-05-02 15:45:37 They have certainly rehearsed the narrative. I was shocked at how much blame was apportioned to the national assembly, the defence of subsidy, the overplay of "grand corruption" in the past admin when oil prices were high. Absolute shock.
3852 2018-05-02 15:45:23 Note to self: sardines in olive oil with spicy cracked pepper > sardines in olive oil with jalapeno.

A liberal denyer who actually believes Pizzagate is real?

I DO know about Gaddafi.
I know that he was no longer a problem for us, or for anyone else.
I also know that Libya was gold and oil rich, and that he was moving Libya to a gold-and-oil-based currency.
3883 2018-05-02 15:42:18 Protecting themselves protecting those who love them. Projecting an image. Cowardice. Fear of conflict, oil on troubled waters.

3886 2018-05-02 15:42:07 Seen a tweet yesterday. This woman is anti oil. Is heavily involved in the KM pipeline  protests. I looked on her timeline and she tweeted that in 6 more weeks her family is going on vacation travelling across Canada and was bitching about the price of fuel . Total hypocrites

3925 2018-05-02 15:38:38 2018 is turning into a real nightmare of a year and we aren't even halfway through it. What's dumb is war with Iran will cause oil prices to skyrocket and cause the global economy to crash.
3926 2018-05-02 15:38:29 You omit capital spending in your article. This is the single most important measure of the feel-good factor in the oil patch and hence Alberta. Until there is a material uplift in capital these recessionary sentiments will remain. This is more relevant than partisanship.
3927 2018-05-02 15:38:28 You're clueless Bill.

3961 2018-05-02 15:35:54 Solar, wind, geothermal. There are other choices. We need to end our dependence on oil for national security purposes in every country.
3962 2018-05-02 15:35:39 In more ways than one. Besides actual oil itself it's to keep the petrodollar going. If many oil producing countries get away from the dollar like Iran just did our fiat American money would plummet in value. Essentially reducing dollars as the world's reserve currency.

3968 2018-05-02 15:35:10 If these 2 series re-converge via oil heading to EM FX & it would have big implications for shale production, US ISM, & US deficit...
3969 2018-05-02 15:35:02 Yeah I sometimes get that. Fried eggs are good if you're not using oil, but high in cholesterol so should couple of times a week is enough.
3970 2018-05-02 15:34:51 his political career has been guided by "select faith" those bits of religion he could attach to things & make it seem like he wasn't in bed with big oil co's.

This is the effect of running a lighter crude slate (I.e. more shale oil) Refiners running cheap oil rather than product margin

3983 2018-05-02 15:32:47 Why now oil marketing companies not raising oil prices when crude prices are high. Because of election in Karnataka. Then how is free market concept. When government wants they can do anything. Government can easily curtail the prices but they know no opposition.

4115 2018-05-02 15:18:02 Yeah,I know it's a batch pipe -with nothing refined coming to BC from Edmonuchuk. How much oil will be shipped to other countries? Zip.
KM makes a killing transporting dilutants to Edmonton,thinned bitumen to Burnaby, then tankers to US - that's why they insist on present model.

4151 2018-05-02 15:13:43 I am not say that I can't be done, everything takes hard work and persistence. But in my opinion it is not needed and unnecessary to have to pay the amount of money for gas,fuel and oil prices in today's world.

4240 2018-05-02 15:05:13 Secretly talking to the oil industry lobbyists he represents who don’t give a F about protecting our environment.
4241 2018-05-02 15:05:12 Not having to visit a gas station or get oil changes is already more convenient. The up front cost of EVs is higher, but maintenance & fuel/charge is much lower. Lithium and cobalt can be reused/recycled at +500k mile end of life
4242 2018-05-02 15:05:08 Eat a lot of veggies containing Vitamin B1 and cut down on sugar! Will not bother you or Hazel but oil works to.

4245 2018-05-02 15:04:56 Andrew you just made an arse of yourself,GERS as many estimates and guesses
How do you explain GERS having "Oil from an unknown source"
4246 2018-05-02 15:04:48 Sorry sis, thats long, olive oil & avocado oil is really good in the meantime x
4247 2018-05-02 15:04:48 I am peeved by anything on a door knob. Like oil or strange water or anything really
4248 2018-05-02 15:04:45 The Oil slaves, Evolved and Black Gold island are some of @realdanielemeka's work that I can't still get over after years of coming in contact with them.

4251 2018-05-02 15:04:34 Take some fresh broccoli use a tiny bit of olive oil pour on the broccoli then use a little bit of garlic plus seasoning (it’s actually called garlic plus) lol then a pinch of kosher salt.. then bake it until it’s a bit soft take em out and then put some Parm cheese on it.

4256 2018-05-02 15:04:01 Venezuela gave Indian Government a proposal to buy crude oil 30% cheaper than others, if they do so in interest of public interest, it will be a major decision...but the payment is in crypto currency...

Ack!
4260 2018-05-02 15:03:28 While global crude oil prices remain low, government has to explain why domestic petrol and diesel price are at a record high?
Is this not an unnecessarily and a regrettable burden on common people ? @dpradhanbjp
4261 2018-05-02 15:03:28 Driving around with a check oil sign on and a quarter tank. My best life right here
4262 2018-05-02 15:03:25 Westminster takes 92% of it,,,after indy and a fight to get them to let go,,scots will have 100% and be able to manage the oil far better than Westminster ever did.

4265 2018-05-02 15:03:11 Gotta go get an oil change 
4266 2018-05-02 15:03:10 They already have the arguments from the huge tax subsidies the oil industry gets for every well that doesn't recoup it's cost. The industry is too "speculative." So we have to recoup their gambling losses.
4267 2018-05-02 15:03:03 Unethical people such as yourself are the only ones who don’t take Walter Shaub seriously. You are nothing more than a climber. A snake oil salesman. You are NOT good people.

4270 2018-05-02 15:02:48 Yes I do thanks!
As for that other bollocks, how is "oil from unknown source" which sounds suspicious anyway equal "Scotland pays 9bn service charge"

How can they relate to the same thing? Do you think these things through before tweeting them?
4271 2018-05-02 15:02:45 We called 'Ghani's oil' / घानी का तेल 
Thanks for sharing 
4272 2018-05-02 15:02:40 Yes you are correct, but my question is what type of job fields those jobs have been created in? My point beening is that if I was to start a farm or mobile detailing service, I would have to pay the big gas,fuel and oil prices to be successful in that business.
4273 2018-05-02 15:02:29 Yes, real rates are not nearly as high, but US does have positive real rates and Europe and Japan don't.  There are other differences too, like the direction on oil prices. Still, my point remains that one cannot deduce the $USD direction from the direction of the twin deficit.
4274 2018-05-02 15:02:25 Don't forget to mention your in Iraq to protect the oil agreement with the IRAQI Shia regime made in 2003. Your goal is to protect the agreement AT ALL COST.
4275 2018-05-02 15:02:23 Absolutely, although I did an olive oil roux with corn flour, rather than a traditional butter and white flour.

Would have done bacon fat and corn flour, but girlfriend doesn't care much for bacon.
4276 2018-05-02 15:02:22 It's all about control of middle east and oil. I feel sorry for American people who believe politicians. Iran is not just a group of people who rule it, it's a nation of 85 Million people who will suffer from decisions made by a fool like Trump.
4277 2018-05-02 15:02:19 Don't forget to oil up first!
4278 2018-05-02 15:02:11 Hmmm did I mess up the oil?
4279 2018-05-02 15:02:00 I used a coconut oil hair mask last night.

4282 2018-05-02 15:01:51 Why is it in Scottish international waters then,,?even the UK GOV accepts its Scottish oil,,,even the 6K miles that Blair stole and gave to England the night before scots parly opened,,,the UK does not own everything you know

4284 2018-05-02 15:01:40 First time using acrylic paint after five months of oil and I hate it so passionately.
4285 2018-05-02 15:01:27 And I was trying to make the point that freedom of the people is worth it no matter the cost. The CIA didn’t start the conflict in Syria, they didn’t start it in Ukraine. It wasn’t about oil or coup d’etats or US intervention. That’s Russia speak

4299 2018-05-02 15:00:25 WHAT is CBD OIL?             
#LoveMyOil    There are many different reasons why people incorporate daily CBD oil into their lives. As a supplement, CBD oil encourages balance and wellness and provides a slew of minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants that support health.

4314 2018-05-02 14:59:23 If you take this seriously, @PepsiCo must set a clear deadline & implementation plan for independently verified ‘No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ supply chains & business partners. You must go beyond RSPO oil & ensure that all products are Conflict Palm Oil free.
4315 2018-05-02 14:59:23 I said the issue was different. The same people of Konkan bought bonds to raise funds for Konkan Railway. Oil refinery can be compared to Enron's project (which the Oppn parties wanted to drown in sea but then mysteriously revived) and Jaitapur nuclear power plant.

4320 2018-05-02 14:58:12 @PepsiCo your palm oil policy is not sustainable. Close the loophole allowing your partners to destroy rainforests and exploit #palmoil workers.
4321 2018-05-02 14:58:07 Haha hmmm. Kanin mo lagyan mo ng one spoon of soy sauce at oil. Pwede nayan. Tiyaga na lang haha
4322 2018-05-02 14:57:41 So without crude oil our present govt cannot achieve anything.

4326 2018-05-02 14:57:20 @realDonaldTrump Good morning, President Trump. The money I received from your tax break is going right into the pockets of these gas/oil tycoons. You think you could get em to lower gas prices? No way in hell should we Americans be paying what we are paying for gasoline.
4327 2018-05-02 14:57:19 Sama sih kayak yg merah biru tpi yg oil baunya enak bgt sukaaak
4328 2018-05-02 14:57:19 don’t want to downplay the achievement represented by 3 days without coal powered electricity but hydropower is not counted among renewables by OECD standards and #lka did 20% last year. We do rather more thermal oil than coal these days as well and also do not use nuclear energy

4362 2018-05-02 14:54:11 3/ However, the short-lived CEIFB allowed the Conservatives to wipe out the notional $50b+ EI surplus, which cynics say was the whole idea. In 2015, the Liberals doled out extra benefits (oil downturn), stimulative in nature. I don't think an arm's-length CEIFB could do that.
4363 2018-05-02 14:54:09 Speaking of oil and gas Bill, I'm still waiting to hear back off you from yesterday about how it's gonna work out that an Indy Scotland would get 100% of oil and gas revenues. I asked for an explanation how this would work but never heard back

4400 2018-05-02 14:50:03 I'm guessing none of these folks grandfathered in a Tapcal Trust Fund to ensure dynasty existence. So odd that I'm the only one yapping about this anti-democratic fund. Does no one care? I wonder if oil companies donated to this fund. @OilGasCanada Is this why AB is poor now?
4401 2018-05-02 14:49:59 It's done just like oven fries made with potatoes or sweet potatoes but with carrot sticks. We like using oil to make them crisp up in the oven but if the oil doesn't appeal then you could bake them with just a really light spray of oil.

4408 2018-05-02 14:49:15 Indeed. Remember the market reaction to MXO when mexico opened up their oil fields and everyone was going crazy for it. Not even a rise for this bit of news. It's welcomed to me anyways. Will be interesting to see how it plays out anyways. I'm happy holding

4411 2018-05-02 14:49:04 I'd be more interested in who funds the news organizations than in Zuckerberg's definition of trustworthy. My trust is inversely proportionate to ties to oil companies, so WSJ is the least trustworthy.
4412 2018-05-02 14:48:59 That's nothing compared to Iran's provocative hoarding of US oil under Iranian sand
4413 2018-05-02 14:48:53 I'm curious how the unions get flak for wanting better wages but the state legislature doesn't for cutting funding and making our public education system pay for oil tax breaks.

4417 2018-05-02 14:48:24 I love how there are techniques that work over many things. For example, flour coated in oil/fat which then mixes well with water based liquid. Works for cheese sauce and gravy, which are so very different.

4473 2018-05-02 14:41:57 Now, that said, we also know that even CBD oil can have a 'slowing' effect on the brains of younger (under 25) ppl. So, interesting but worrisome.

4504 2018-05-02 14:38:53 It is not a recent phenomenon at all . As for a western plot to destabilise the Middle East it is in everyone’s interest to keep it stable as the Syrian crisis shows. As for oil and gas a move to renewable energy sources reduces the strategical importance of the area.
4505 2018-05-02 14:38:48 It can build oil platforms too. But now it's building underground gas pipeline for Turkstream project (Russia to Turkey across the Blacksea. Currently Gasprom uses Blue Stream undersea pipe and Trans-Balkan land based pipeline to deliver gas to Turkey)

4508 2018-05-02 14:38:38 Reaction as expected, none. Still waiting. All along oil fundamentals are steadily getting worse, inventory builds, increasing production, surging dollar, slowing economies and declining consumption. Bid it up!!

4661 2018-05-02 14:28:56 Sure. Except most of these incentives are paid by the Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund - which is financed almost exclusively by the money it gets from selling its oil to other countries. Good but a bit hypocritical.
4662 2018-05-02 14:28:53 Yum - citrus & cucumber are my faves!  When I don’t have time to do a fruit infusion, I add a single drop of essential oil to my water.  So delicious with Grapefruit, Lemon, Juniper Berry, even Ginger!  (Only use oils that are safe for internal use!)

4695 2018-05-02 14:25:03 I read the study. Interesting to note that many of the receding beaches are due to subsurface removal of water/oil not SLR from CC. No mention the Norfolk comet impact crater causing beach loss though.
4696 2018-05-02 14:24:37 The risk is there from a lack of a legal framework for governance of data. Some industries are forbidden by regulator to export their data (Oil & Gas, for example) others have very strict retention guidelines (must save originals for x years). For these the SaaS model is better.

4701 2018-05-02 14:23:32 @SecretaryPerry, you need to get control over escalating gas prices. In Indiana, prices have gone from $2.51 to $2.95 in 2 weeks. This will eat up our tax cuts & play a definite role in mid-term elections. Greed of oil companies & station owners will hurt the good Trump is doing.

4704 2018-05-02 14:22:58 Both Labour and Tory govts have dirt mitts on preventing oil on the Clyde , in order to keep Trident in Scotland , and the Scots cap in hand.

4727 2018-05-02 14:20:50 That wealth fund was only created in the 90s for funding State Pensions originally , Scotland though happy to give that sort of money to Westminster that plotted to steal it - both Labour and Conservative govts.

Now lets talk preventing a 2nd oil boom on the CLyde.
4728 2018-05-02 14:20:27 Evidently oblivious to Thatcher’s closure of Ravenscraig, decades of Westminster mismanagement of the oil industry when compared to our Northern European neighbours. You’re wasting your time talking to these folk tbh
4729 2018-05-02 14:20:11 Iraq had a regional oil conflict with Kuwait over border drilling. HW Bush State Dept. signaled they would not intervene. Kuwait launched a massive PR campaign to win over the US sentiment.

Otherwise, all illegals, of all races, should be booted out.

4736 2018-05-02 14:19:30 Just to make it clear: The only way Simpson/Alexander makes a dent in the maintenance backlog is if oil goes back to 2008 prices, when everyone paid $4+/gallon for gas. That's what @SecretaryZinke is selling here.

Congress can and should fund parks with existing revenue.
4737 2018-05-02 14:19:23 so apart from crude oil what else can our government sell to make money...

Norway has taken 5% less oil from N Sea, and has a 1 Trillion dollar wealth fund.

4756 2018-05-02 14:17:04 China’s massive growth means that there is nearly more cars on the road than the US (and their population is 5 times bigger). When this does happen, China will need to import more oil than the world can currently produce. Capitalism definitely, finally...
4757 2018-05-02 14:16:59 The fact that such men in Japan are allowed to have success rather than being publicly boiled alive in oil in cauldrons full of angry scorpions is very concerning...

4759 2018-05-02 14:16:46 Airplanes have very little hope of alternative power, oil being a finite source, should be retained for the distant future! Electric trains run on coal and eventually solar, the likely source, non nuclear ships consume oil as wrll.

4776 2018-05-02 14:15:00 I drive a Volt, charged by my solar panels. Gas prices in this country are artificially low, not reflective of the societal costs of petroleum use. This is “choosing a winner” and is only slightly offset by subsidies for alternative fuels. Wind is cheaper than oil in most places.
4777 2018-05-02 14:14:49 As long as we are dependent on the oil in the region to fuel our economies, those countries will basically get to do what ever the hell they want in exchange for oil... sad but true

4793 2018-05-02 14:12:40 @MSNBC @CNN @FoxNews it is not news to see and talk about Trump tweets all day long. FLINT NEEDS HELP, PUERTO RICO NEEDS POWER, OIL SPILL , TRANSPORTATION,  IMMIGRATION, etc. Maybe use the noon and 6 O'clock for tweets. #alternativefacts #TheBeat #Retail danger of Roundup poison.
4794 2018-05-02 14:12:38 Why the economy is failing is because we depend so much on OIL. And we're loosing out of the opportunity in Agriculture. The earlier, the better.

4796 2018-05-02 14:12:26 I wanna go get an oil change for my car, but i also dont want to miss the new RDR 2 trailer lol.

4798 2018-05-02 14:12:20 I accidentally ate a little bit of olive last night and 15 hours later I am STILL burping and re-tasting the grossness, help. 

Olives are the foulest of the foul and only good for making olive oil don’t @ me.

4801 2018-05-02 14:12:12 How are you doing that when you’ve cut $1.1B from budget, don’t respect the employees, and are selling off land for oil and mining? Resign, criminal
4802 2018-05-02 14:12:11 Tried this castor oil for my beard this morning, collar of my shirt is greasy as a mf oil spill now
4803 2018-05-02 14:12:07 Hi, the team have now visited & the work has partially  been completed. They are awaiting uplift equipment for the oil drums. We'll keep you posted. Thanks again for reporting.
4804 2018-05-02 14:12:06 Plus at least for russia currency can play a major role in shifting the fiscal breakeven. Vennie is likely off the charts with the sharp drops in production. One thing though, the increase in oil price has brought the external positions more into balance/surplus
4805 2018-05-02 14:11:54 It all depends on the troop. I learned how to change oil and rotate tires. My troop fundraised for years and then went to an international Girl Scout center in Switzerland. Boy Scout friends of mine just went into the woods and set things on fire.

4811 2018-05-02 14:11:24 Finally getting my oil changed .... then i gotta rush home get dressed, and then it’s the rush the hustle n bustle of the day
4812 2018-05-02 14:11:23 As this view holds, if Iran is alllowed to sell oil for gold, it will lead to much higher gold prices as oil consumers must bid up gold to buy oil. So the US will smash them. As Saddam Houssein (yes, people believe this)
4813 2018-05-02 14:11:15 He shouldn't be alive, oil is above $44.
4814 2018-05-02 14:11:09 If an oil company wants to buy your house, there's oil underneath.
4815 2018-05-02 14:11:04 Who knows what they add to the whites to make it taste so.,....

And as an side, did you know that the oil they use for fries has a chemical that can promote hair growth? 
4816 2018-05-02 14:11:03 No, data is not the new oil. Oil is a commodity, and if you use it,it is gone. Therefor, access to oil is highly restricted and expansive.
Data, on the other hand, can be used over and over again. Access does not need to be restricted. #opendata

4826 2018-05-02 14:10:09 My car is just a smidge past its 80k mile / 8 yr warranty (on both counts) and just had an oil change at the dealer a few weeks ago.
I don't think it's unreasonable to be mildly suspicious that with those things in mind, the check engine light has lit in my car. @MazdaUSA
4827 2018-05-02 14:10:02 You know youre an adult when you had to make a decision that an oil change was more important than getting a new contour palette 
4828 2018-05-02 14:09:52 Cooking oil and paper towels for starters, ftw.
4829 2018-05-02 14:09:47 Those who are centrist, socially progressive but fiscally conservative, are pragmatic. 
A recovery is underway, but it's slow & has not reached pre-recession level, so AB has not "recovered" & the gains made in AB/Canada have been driven by oil price rebound.  #abpoli #cdnecon
4830 2018-05-02 14:09:39 The 124 & OD6 combo is pretty common. The oil line system S&S has in their instruction manual is the only way others are accomplishing this.

4835 2018-05-02 14:09:09 There's also another Guru myth that recently is brought up once again, the talk of Iraq selling oil or oil credits to the United States at some ridiculously low price.  That's utter nonsense.
4836 2018-05-02 14:08:59 could this be it Kiddles?!
4837 2018-05-02 14:08:54 Im.... speechless. I keep calling the bike dude and he at least has the tires and the oil change done, but turns out the new drive belt thingy that I need doesnt cost 200, but 300€ -.- Plus tires and work and everything and I'm just... destroyed. What a fucked up day

4840 2018-05-02 14:08:38 another fact to consider , palm oil isn't a native south east asia plant , its an alien species . 

then you should consider LULUCF of Kyoto protocol 

and by all means 10 - 15 years of yield isn't sustainable
4841 2018-05-02 14:08:35 I wonder if it’ll help with breakouts cause my skin holds so much oil in certain spots. I’m gonna check with my cousin.

4851 2018-05-02 14:06:33 It’s amazing how tolerant we can be while we are drunk on their oil.
4852 2018-05-02 14:06:25 My experience matches yours. But this year I did get a salon-sized bottle of clipper oil and it’s a game changer.
4853 2018-05-02 14:06:13 The agricultural economy needed humans to do the work. Highkey, the South’s economy was heavily dependent of slavery and independent of the North’s oil. That was an issue because the oil oligarchs hated that the South’s production required no machinery and none of their oil

4867 2018-05-02 14:04:30 Venezuela, the world’s second-largest crude oil producer, is learnt to have offered a 30% discount on India’s petroleum imports from there—but only if payments are made using the cryptocurrency backed by that country’s government.

So let’s see if India accept crypto fully $btc

4872 2018-05-02 14:03:59 and sir then you should also compare crude oil price ?

4886 2018-05-02 14:03:11 In this province, we tend to equate the deficit to the state of the economy. The higher the oil price, the bigger the surplus. Politicians don’t help when they spin it as the same thing.

4888 2018-05-02 14:03:00 Do you have PTSD? The Holy oil and the Extreme oil will help. I had severe PTSD. It is gone. I gave the oils to a vet who had PTSD.

4900 2018-05-02 14:02:19 I pun tak sure mineral oil ke apa. Lupa term tu  oh ya hada labo i baca org kata tu sesuai untuk dry skin je. Kalau nak cuba product, kena cuba satu2 dulu. So boleh tahu mana yang tak sesuai terus stop pakai product tu

4904 2018-05-02 14:01:47 I'm in the process of switching to natural skin care and I'd love to hear recommendations!

I'm currently using rosehip oil gifted to me by my witchy sister @Hocus_mfc as well as argan oil and coconut oil! I'd like to pick up tea tree and lavender oil asap too
4905 2018-05-02 14:01:45 Have you tried coconut oil?

4907 2018-05-02 14:01:28 Lol! I know a buddy doing some basic af quant analysis on oil rights records here in Texas and he’s able to make the easiest trades in the world with the people that own the right because they have no idea what they own

4911 2018-05-02 14:01:02 Right, because it had *nothing* to do with relying on oil exports for 90% of gov't revenue.

Not that you've made even the slightest semblance of a point - I'm not looking for Venezuela style governance. But hey, strawmen are the resort of those incapable of actual debate.

4931 2018-05-02 13:58:48 I’d say it’s a confluence of factors: geopolitics, a stronger USD, rising oil prices, Trump threatening to withdraw aid to countries not voting with the US in the UN, and our own goal in terms of trucks being torched in KZN (could only be in KZN!).

4938 2018-05-02 13:57:50 Switched up 2 parts coconut oil for 3 originally 3 parts butter in my coffee and it's a bit more tasty. Erythritol is a must, though.
4939 2018-05-02 13:57:25 our oil is full emissions, but foreign oil has less. So foreign oil is the diet cola of the oil industry
4940 2018-05-02 13:57:18 Yes! Making anything another rich while we are paying more at the pump because Trump has halted oil production IN THE US AND SELLING OUR OIL RESERVES TO CHINA so it would look like we have a shortage. The Repummunists are blaming OPEC of course and raping the consumer at the pump

4963 2018-05-02 13:55:12 Well to have a fair playing field, it’s time to end the 100 year oil subsidies.

4967 2018-05-02 13:54:59 Apart from Tucker, Fox has been a disgrace lately. Friedman is more menacing, Woolsey is crackers, his whole diatribe at the beginning is total projection. They tried and failed with the oil, if Israel hits Iran, who then takes out the Saudis, it’s the US that will hurt a lot.

4969 2018-05-02 13:54:29 .@POTUS put the toughest sanctions on NK that the US has ever imposed. He involved the international comm., pressured the Chinese to help by including sanctions on Chinese Banks, sanctioning 27 co. & 28 ships, shutting down maritime smuggling activities to obtain oil & sell coal.

4971 2018-05-02 13:54:12 There were some successful experiments with running high-power computers in mineral oil baths back around 2000, IIRC. No fans required, but moving the rig was a bit of a pain.

When addressing muslims he tells them - “You have strength in unity”. 
When addressing non muslims he states - “Diversity is your strength”.

4997 2018-05-02 13:51:02 What I find unfair is that oil companies are selling gas at the same price they were selling it when the baril of oil was at 150$, its selling at 70$ today!? And we give these companies subsidies. Explain that!

5003 2018-05-02 13:50:16 People like trucks when oil is cheap. Seems odd to gamble like that. 

Tesla is going to be a disaster this week. Good time to short.
5004 2018-05-02 13:50:11 That is fake news peddled by western countries. It was buyers market before 10 years as oil price was low and other countries had enough oil on their own to live without Arabs. But, now it is different

5011 2018-05-02 13:49:30 don't pretend that ur armies are not slaying people 
they re & they ve always been

the difference is
Islam said "slay them" for acheiving justice and it was commanded only against combatants
where ur people are slaying people for oil , greediness 
and they target innocent people

5013 2018-05-02 13:49:17 A couple of the primary beneficiaries are foreign pockets - primarily Russia and Saudi Arabia. The years of lower oil prices hit Russia hard. The surge in oil prices in the last year or so pretty much offset the economic effects of the sanctions against Russia.

5045 2018-05-02 13:45:26 I agree Alberta could have managed oil revenues better over the last 40 years.  But Norway also has a state oil company that continues to pump significant oil volumes, primarily for export, and having saved all that money can afford the taxes.

5063 2018-05-02 13:43:46 Partly explains why Russia wants to mess with democracies who were making progress on Paris goals. The most important geopolitical goal is to get off oil, both to reduce emissions and strike a blow against authoritarian regimes in Russia, the Middle East, and elsewhere.

5068 2018-05-02 13:43:18 They're aggregating oil and gas rigs. Not sure why OPEC is doing that, since gas production isn't OPEC's remit

5070 2018-05-02 13:43:01 Trans Canada was working on EE proj and had invested a lot of time, money and resources.  Shovels were not in the ground.  was an opportunity to displace dirty foreign oil with Canadian oil, achieve fossil fuel energy self sufficiency, create jobs opps in Canada for Canadians.

5075 2018-05-02 13:42:30 thanks! of course he would solicit oil & chem co's & then come back to them hat in hand when he ran out of $$.
5076 2018-05-02 13:42:29 I agree that there has been tax increases but was there a huge 20 cent per litre tax added on just a few weeks ago? I'm not defending the liberals and I  never will but I think a big part of this is just move profit taking by oil companies.
5077 2018-05-02 13:42:18 疲れ果てたから寝る
5078 2018-05-02 13:42:16 Side note here. Talking about gas prices is decades old, and nonsense knowing our planet has to move away from burning fossil fuels. I wish media would push that need instead of letting the oil companies profit off pollution.
5079 2018-05-02 13:42:14 You know what else need oil... go ahead ask.. dare you 
5080 2018-05-02 13:42:06 If US/Israel attack Iran, Iran will hit back. Has S-300. Would likely fend off the attack. Iranian counter attack would be catastrophic, especially if Demona nuclear reactor is destroyed. Oil fields of M.E. would be destroyed. World would experience economic Ice Age. Will see.

5083 2018-05-02 13:41:00 In a newsletter I get about the automotive industry, a followup story about Ford dropping sedan production was immediately followed by a article about an oil hedge fund manager saying $300 barrels of oil are "not impossible."
Now, go buy that Expedition Max.
5084 2018-05-02 13:40:55 Cars used to be made to work on, no more now you just drive them. They last longer. I still can't bring myself to going 7500 miles between oil changes though.

5086 2018-05-02 13:40:47 Very sad that project that wants mexico back in the 1970’s (president without checks and balances, limited free press, oil as key to economic development) is leading vs project looking into 2050 (strong institutions, free press, technology & value added services)

5092 2018-05-02 13:40:15 The marketplace has no demand for low mileage polluting cars, unless there's a Hummer cult out there somewhere waiting to drive a pig. This is a sop to the oil industry. Nevertheless, thanks. We appreciate your efforts.

5105 2018-05-02 13:37:49 Oil and gas receives a shit ton of tax credits and grants. Secondly, if they hadn’t produced electricity, they probably wouldn’t be putting up new ones at the end of the old turbines life cycle. There is over 82 GW of wind power capacity installed in the US; that’s quite a bit.

5151 2018-05-02 13:33:03 Many parents but there kids buy foods containing palm oil and don’t even think about the harm they can do to animals to get palm oil, foods like Rice Krispies treats  contain palm pool. What I will do to help is I will stop eating Rice Krispie treats #cutconflictpalm
5152 2018-05-02 13:32:46 Have you read about the nations history when Rockefeller tried monopolizing kerosene oil? Capitalism opened up new ideals to the common man: globalization, free trade, property rights, the rule of law, and entrepreneurship. Because of big corps. We have a globalized market.

5159 2018-05-02 13:31:59 It's basically the same reason why benighted parts of the globe still use the Imperial system :).

I suspect a lot of it has to do with the fact that BP is very often the go-to source for historical statistics (I for one use them) and for an oil company, MTOE is natural default.

I know the Urban Decay ones are also AMAZING at oil control. So I might get ones of these for summer days when I'll be in the hot sun all day.

5183 2018-05-02 13:29:41 The only reason jobs are coming back is due to rising oil prices, we will see what Albertans think of the NDP next election, I think you will be disappointed if you think Albertans are happy with an NDP government
5184 2018-05-02 13:29:38 There are lot of reasons for actions , oil is only one of them. Think only " if there the inhabitant where Christians or Jews, not Muslims ? How where the intervention then... so there is not only a interest of oil and money. Power is used to keep pressure on Muslims.

5189 2018-05-02 13:28:35 I'm well aware of the West involvement in Africa. The African nations are to blame for the poverty of their people. African nations have a bunch elite govts that keep all the riches for themselves. Africa is still rich in gold, diamonds and oil.

5195 2018-05-02 13:27:59 Very easy . Just a little oil to grease the pan , put in the crushed garlic . Ensure it’s crushed mildly with the skin . And fry it slightly . After it’s a little crispy add some salt and red chilli accordingly . It’s ready .

5307 2018-05-02 13:14:10 Both sides haven't been to blame for a lot of things the last 50 years. But I think, in the end, the USA of this era will most be faulted for siding with the oil industry rather than dealing properly with climate change. We're fiddling while Rome is burning.

5310 2018-05-02 13:13:39 @4dietaryreform   I see adverts for cold pressed High Oleic Sunflower Oils with a special variety (non GMO) sunflower seed that is low in omega 6 & high in Omega 9. People are calling this a banting oil. Is it safe to use?
5311 2018-05-02 13:13:30 I am sure but we have to standardize chicharon. No. 1. Only the finest cooking oil. So far Lapid’s is consistently good without any hard parts that can break your teeth. If this Chinese has the secret, perhaps fine him, or imprison him until he shows us how to do it right.

5349 2018-05-02 13:08:43 Again let me break this down to you sense common sense isn’t that common. Fake hair without moisture oil is not going to grow your hair. It’s not the hair that grows your hair it’s the oil in moisturizer that you put in your hair which is food for your hair that causes it to grow
5350 2018-05-02 13:08:28 - remove make up before you go to bed
- don't rub your eyes

• Vaseline 
• coconut- , olive- and castoroil
• onions 
• vitamin E oil

We didnt want it, dont want it, and as for oil revenue, open your eyes and look at the desperate state of thousands of oil workers and their families in the north east that have lost their jobs and more.

Back in 08, I was a youth corper in Bodo, Gokona LGA (one of the oil spill hotspots of ogoniland) my friend use to buy AGO from some natives..."on code". These guys don't just sell to anybody then due to fear of arrest. They were cooking theirs already.

5482 2018-05-02 12:51:05 You know what I mean. There's only a fixed amount of oil in the earth that's built over a process over hundreds of millions of years. It can be depleted.

5484 2018-05-02 12:50:58 confused when people lecture me and tell me you cannot lose weight by eating fat. 

False. I ate 6lbs of butter, 4 large tubs of mayo, a large container of coconut oil, a jar of EVOL and still lost 40lbs in 4 months I was never hungry and I never exercised once. It’s called #keto

5486 2018-05-02 12:50:46 oil palm trees? i read it takes 3-4 years before they can be harvested. they yield a lot of oil and can be harvested year round. so, it's not the worst crop, but deforestation is a serious issue. also, growing crops for #biofuel is one of the worst ideas ever.

5492 2018-05-02 12:49:25 The difference between discovery and recovery. You can be sat on the biggest gold deposit in the world but it isn't worth buying a shovel unless you can sell the gold at a profit. Oil is as you describe, a whole lot more volatile in recovery and price.

5503 2018-05-02 12:48:10 No, you're wrong. The SAA and allies are forbidden to cross the Euphrates by the US. They want the SDF to control that area and its oil resources. They aren't attacking the remnants of ISIS there as otherwise they'd have no excuse for staying in Syria.

5507 2018-05-02 12:47:19 I think at least some of these photos are showing orange smoke from an ANFO (ammonium nitrate fuel oil) mixture that is too "lean". The NO2 produced from such explosions also causes respiratory tract irritation so it confuses the situation.

Coal isn't just old forest, it is also forest soil which is the big component in coal ash and also the source of mercury that makes our fish poisonous to eat.

Why #SaudiArabia is pushing for higher #oil prices? Because it needs them. According to IMF, the fiscal break-even oil prices has risen to ~$88 a barrel in 2018, up from #$83 a barrel in 2017.
5620 2018-05-02 12:35:41 In order to stop increasing palm oil plantations, what can I do to save the ecosystem is I’d avoid using any products contained palm oil —- Shampoo, Soap, Detergent, or Cosmetics. #startwith1thing #SaveLeuserEcosystem

5710 2018-05-02 12:23:13 I just drove to Nissan for them to tell me I need to pay $400 for service!? Nigga for what!? I just wanted a damn oil change...
5711 2018-05-02 12:22:54 The sauce recipe is :
2 Tbsp gochujang
1 Tbsp sesame oil
1 Tbsp sugar 
1 Tbsp water
1 Tbsp roasted sesame seeds
1 tsp vinegar – I used apple vinegar
1 tsp minced garlic

Would you  just dial up the other ingredients, or would you add sriracha plus red pepper flakes?
5712 2018-05-02 12:22:49 What have you done little man?

5722 2018-05-02 12:21:01 If you don't have gochujang, you could try tossing in a touch of any of these:  miso, minced garlic, sesame oil, red pepper powder or flakes, sesame seeds, a touch of sugar, a touch of vinegar.
5723 2018-05-02 12:20:57 Just look at products in the shelf. They have "with castor oil"  or just castor oil nje

5727 2018-05-02 12:20:18 $5.33

Down here in Tennessee the latest was $2.59 for 100% gas (non-ethanol) 87 octane.
Dang you have some serious taxes up there. Should be cheaper bcs of all the oil you pump. That makes NO SENSE.

5792 2018-05-02 12:12:50 The petrol price has been the same for 6 weeks in a row. So whatever they said b4 that it fluctuates based on world crude oil price is all BULL! I think they just + or - as they wish b4 this. There is no formula to calculate at all!
5793 2018-05-02 12:12:48 it’s not really “destroying” nature tho??? just cause they growing it in different shapes doesn’t make it bad?? destroying nature is oil pollution in the sea, littering, hunting down animals, deforestation. this is just plant modifications???????
5794 2018-05-02 12:12:48 Go back to the Carboniferous age and was 20 - 30 time what it is now. The world did not boil over - there was an explosion of forests and vegetation that laid down the massive world wide and oil coal beds.

5803 2018-05-02 12:11:41 There is an Equalization fund which covers the cost of shipping these products across the country. How then, is kerosene as cheap as N83 from official outlets in Lagos, and is N150 from official outlets in Borno and up to N400 from black markets..?

5806 2018-05-02 12:11:23 The general public will be pissed when any of the really old ones start to leak and blame pipelines. Like cars, they rot out. Until sustainable is in place, unfortunately we still need some oil. Transport and personal transport also has to switch first!
5807 2018-05-02 12:11:20 The socialist party is truly showing their ignorance. The oil industry in Venezuela is definitely socialist. It was appropriated by the state and promptly destroyed through corruption and mismanagement - the true hallmark of socialism throughout history.

5814 2018-05-02 12:10:47 Two questions for you Jocky
1) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?
2)Do you think scots would be better off with 100% of oil revenues or the 8% we get at present?
If you answer you will be the first,,the only yoon to NOT run away from those questions
5815 2018-05-02 12:10:42 Exactly, which is why I posted here. They want us to stay and keep the oil, oh.. because Iran may get it.

5838 2018-05-02 12:08:07 If you want to tackle the problem with oil, you need to look at the 3 major points. Energy consumption, energy transmission and energy production. You cannot solve the issue without all three. Nuclear, holds quite a bit of viability if wastage can be overcome.

5848 2018-05-02 12:07:07 Blair, I’ve also studied dilbit extensively and recently published my findings. Dilbit is simply the name for a class of crude oil products. It is easier to recover from water than light oils, which are more likely to disperse into the water column.

5857 2018-05-02 12:05:57 It's against international law that Israel is drilling for oil on land that they occupy that is Syria's land.

scots know they were lied too in 2014 and 2016,,,support for indy at 49% before camaign even starts.The unfair un equal union is over,scots have had enough disrespect from liars who cheat to keep us
5859 2018-05-02 12:05:44 ...better still, 40k minimum wage. There is money in excess crude acc though I don't have precise figures. Fed acc as well.. Millions of dollars earned daily from crude oil sales...

5879 2018-05-02 12:02:42 Did you know that the United States and Israel are occupying a majority of Syrian land that has the most oil on it? Watch @oann and @PearsonSharp to learn more.
5880 2018-05-02 12:02:30 That’s 0.013% of the budget.
5881 2018-05-02 12:02:17 Since 2003 saudi aramco (15/19 9-11 attackers was saudi natives) has grown into one of the richest if not the richest oil companies on the globe and you still abide by that, you don't want exxon on top nor anything else, you like other presidents bow to the people that did 9-11.

5887 2018-05-02 12:01:37 My reasoning using facts offends you? Not surprising. Trumpers and facts are like oil and water. You obviously learned nothing from your time in the military.
5888 2018-05-02 12:01:33 2- the primary reason to go away from oil is environmental. Clearing large amounts of land to house collectors or reflectors is counter intuitive. Transmission is also a factor given you cannot get large open fields that close to cities.

5908 2018-05-02 11:59:01 Sanctions were passed at the end of 2014. I was there in 2013 and the country was already falling apart. Oh, and before you blame the fall in the oil price it was over $100 per barrel at that point
5909 2018-05-02 11:58:54 If there's one thing I learned today, that would be how to mix oil and water.

5958 2018-05-02 11:48:58 @VOCMOpenline I can't agree with carbon taxes if they are going to freeze out heating oil users in the process.

5962 2018-05-02 11:48:28 It's actually a fuel-air mixture that's compressed within the cylinder of the car, and since compressed air fuel is hella flammable, it causes a tiny explosion when the sparking plug fires. But yeah it's gas that's in oil form. So "gasoline."

5964 2018-05-02 11:48:21 Long $CVX. Going big and going safe. Oil is a big trend now.
5965 2018-05-02 11:48:13 Might be hard to believe. One of our major export is petroleum products. 

Cost of crude oil has come down so has the cost of processed Petroleum products.
5966 2018-05-02 11:48:12 + The paradigm shift that needs to occur is a shift away from the driving motive in the 70's - 90's of "renewables is the solution to peak oil"  and get into the reality that CC is upon us and if we don't act quickly with every technology to combat it, we as a society are toast.

5984 2018-05-02 11:44:15 How much notice the world energy industry took of NZ PM Jacinda Ardern's oil exploration ban in April. Some nuclear moment.

5985 2018-05-02 11:44:02 No. You have it all twisted because of anti-Israel sentiments.

US is all over the middle East because of CRUDE OIL. It is their interest.

It all leads to why oil is bought and sold in dollars though US is not in OPEC.

Do you get it now?
Stop hating Israel.

Most of us don't want our taxes going to bombing other countries, or subsidizing unprofitable oil/coal and mass agriculture industries (which is basically welfare for corporations). But corruption doesn't care.
6109 2018-05-02 11:21:59 Sean, trust me on this, Iran is perceived as an enemy by the alliance of Israel -Saudi Arabia and USA (we are in it for oil), so any anti-Iran propaganda is just that, propaganda.

6111 2018-05-02 11:21:46 Your Marie Antoinette-like oil painting CSS is brilliant. Did you use any compilers or is it literally coded line by line?
6112 2018-05-02 11:21:23 Since I was about 10 years old and my parents told me about the gasoline crisis in the late 70's, I've been wondering why we didn't start that search back then.

Oh yeah... Oil companies have a dangerous combination of lots of power, lots of money, and lots of greed.

6114 2018-05-02 11:20:39 Never. @POTUS has always been a corrupt, snake oil salesman for decades in our community in NY, and is continuing this practice with the criminal insurgency in this administration. I will trust & respect Mueller’s conclusions. HE is doing the work.

6118 2018-05-02 11:19:37 Dare I say, given the "size" of our club, and the way we're viewed somehow as "consistent failures", our trajectory has been the most consistent of the current top 6, even if you include the two oil clubs. If that's what is considered a failure, then we all might as well give up.
6119 2018-05-02 11:19:31 Thinker walled pipes doesn't mean less leaks. Double walled pipe guarantee's no leaks, no lose of oil and no polluting of both ground and water. Anyone that says thinker is the solution lack the innovative thinking needed to fix a problem we need fixed.

Between 1998 and 2008 the US gave North Korea $1.3 B in assistance. 50% of that was for food, 40% for energy (oil). There has been nothing since.

6124 2018-05-02 11:19:16 Hej hej, standard oil nie miał żadnego szkodliwego monopolu i w momencie rozbicia tracił już mocno udziały w rynku a na rynku było mnóstwo konkurencji. A w momencie, gdy rosły jego udziały w rynku, to ceny nafty systematycznie spadały. Mit strasznego SO wciąż mocny.

6132 2018-05-02 11:18:05 I have been advocating this for years. The Dept of Ed is the arm of the democrats and union bosses. Created by Carter because of declining test scores.   Scores are worse today. Also created Dept of Energy another bunch of bureaucrats who have never produced one drop of oil.

6497 2018-05-02 10:15:14 Yep, building your economy entirely around oil exports sure doesn't seem like such a smart decision once the prices drop.

6502 2018-05-02 10:14:08 We'll help with one..

The palm oil industry is one that is heavily reliant on migrant labour. So much so that migrant workers have actually contributed to a fair share of the products you see on the shelves at supermarkets. One of these products is butter.

6512 2018-05-02 10:11:54 If you use products that have been in oil already, like fries or snacks, you don't. If you use raw potatos you need to put some oil on them before you put them into the air fryer.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a class of chemicals that occur naturally in coal, crude oil, and gasoline. They also are produced when coal, oil, gas, wood, garbage, and tobacco are burned.

6674 2018-05-02 09:39:23 Also, according to Der Spiegel's report (by far the most detailed about the incident) the Wagner PMCs didn't even take part in the Syrian advance toward the oil field- the US attacked them at their base back by the river.
6675 2018-05-02 09:39:16 I honestly can’t believe as a young kid I wore tanning oil to the pool almost everyday because I thought sunscreen was only for people who easily burned

6677 2018-05-02 09:39:02 I'm with you there. Great products sadly let down by palm oil though.
6678 2018-05-02 09:38:46 Yes, because the North Korean nuclear arsenal is real, but we just don’t care because they don’t have any oil.

6681 2018-05-02 09:37:09 That's what the U.S. government would have you believe. But Putin is domestically focused, like most leaders. The sanctions have helped him increase his genuine support during a period of cheap oil.  He only wants them removed because that would be seen as a victory at home.

6685 2018-05-02 09:35:49 Which co oil u r using then tell u should use this instead of this will get better result as well as good smell
6686 2018-05-02 09:35:19 HYR just seen rns. If they cant make it work at this oil price forget it. Another for the grave yard.
6687 2018-05-02 09:35:17 Why is this surprising? More than half of US oil demand is gasoline, plus huge export demand from Mexico. LTO is simply a cheaper crude to make gasoline, saves on energy costs for heavy conversion units and desulphurisation.

6697 2018-05-02 09:33:42 Untrue. The illegal US base wasn't attacked, the combined Syrian/Wagner force was just advancing toward a nearby oil field. But legally an attack on US forces in Syria by Syrian gov allies would be perfectly justified since US forces there are a blatantly illegal occupation.

6709 2018-05-02 09:31:13 An example: neoliberal-selfish-asshat Macron has plan to create a boom in french industry with renewable energies. Very ambitious.
If cheap oil from Iran-Russia floods european market, Macron's gambit would fail. And with it, what's left of the reputation of the Paris agreement.

6775 2018-05-02 09:19:59 you are right, of course.
But I still don't see how a less monopolic oil industry would deal with the problem of cheap oil. And I believe we agree that cheap oil would prove fatal for investment in renewables.
Maybe one oil monopoly is easy to take down than two. That is my doubt

7222 2018-05-02 07:44:04 Oil boycott by Iran would be a blessing. Europe finally can come to understand that it must become completely independent of oil from unfree dictator countries and that dries up money for Iran and their financing of terrorism.
7223 2018-05-02 07:44:03 Kanye doesn’t know what he’s talking about lol. Everyone thats is currently alive and lacks serious morphological, genetic, or chemical imbalances just so happens to be a “free thinker”.

7229 2018-05-02 07:43:24 We were given olive oil from this producer by friends a few years ago - plus tasting tips. It was delicious ... the start of my learning curve!
7230 2018-05-02 07:42:57 Okay. But this is about 400 years of enslavement being a choice. He mentioned nothing else about it equating to the socioeconomic issues of 2018.
7231 2018-05-02 07:42:22 I said I need a foot massage, this man said yeah I got the oil and everything I gotchu.... dude whips out A&D ointment. Boy bye don't talk to me.
7232 2018-05-02 07:42:21 After all my #HUSTLES in life to be sucessful @MBuhari will say I'm lazy and dependent on Free oil money. PLEASE #RESPECTMYHUSTLE
7233 2018-05-02 07:42:03 Go back a ways b4~for a brief-fuller context:
>Iran's oil reserves coveted/raped by (now) BP since ~1906
>Soviets invade (4oil) during WWII ~forced-out in '46
>UK convinces US to stage coup against mostly-popular, pro-democratic
& oil-reserve-protectionist PM Mosaddegh ('51>'53).
7234 2018-05-02 07:41:53 Still using “I”. As in, just you. No kids. No pets (maybe?). No responsibilities for others.
I live in much the same fashion. No kids. No family. No connections. Few possessions. It’s liberating tbh.
7235 2018-05-02 07:41:53 Those “work requirements” are basically “work or lose your welfare, but if you work too much or make too much you’ll still lose your welfare”.
Hence the challenges.
7236 2018-05-02 07:41:50 I actually, fully, enjoy capitalism. But I also like to read. Maybe you “free thinkers” should give it a try. 
7237 2018-05-02 07:41:40 So we digressed from the original thought stated by Kanye. That is my concern. I get it! You left your situation but for many especially POC it is not so easy.

7267 2018-05-02 07:34:39 @aitkakaaki President Buhari was unable to market Nigeria to the US. The opportunity he had to ask America to increase her purchase of crude oil from Nigeria was wasted. Imagine saying, "I cannot ask America to buy our oil." Sad reality.

7271 2018-05-02 07:33:44 So back to the 400 years of slavery Black people endured. It was not a choice. And in 2018 we are still dealing with the product of slavery in America.
7272 2018-05-02 07:33:33 And now America will export her agricultural products to Nigeria but our president could not even negotiate any deal for our dear country, not even to ask Trump to buy our oil. this has made mess of the progress recorded in agriculture under the  past administration.

7284 2018-05-02 07:30:36 It will take time to ramp up but its inevitable. 100 years ago the idea of exporting oil from Arabia or Siberia seemed impossibly expensive.

7451 2018-05-02 06:59:58 Thanks for this. You can see where Upton Sinclair got his idea for 'Oil!' (from Ida Tardell). Odd book 'Oil!' - in two parts; first part brilliant & basis for 'There Will Be Blood'  - second part drifts away.

7457 2018-05-02 06:57:20 What? One of the incomes in this household came directly from the oil patch. It was a job not a calling requiring unquestioning loyalty to an industry that is currently in the process of doing everything it can to reduce its labour costs.
7458 2018-05-02 06:56:56 Most ridiculous thing I’ve heard. More so, it’s cheap in poor countries with oil reserves and expensive in richer countries as they can pay for the premium.

7461 2018-05-02 06:56:14 There will be less demand for oil when transport is electrified, so if you help build that the capacity problem on rail will go away.

7526 2018-05-02 06:43:39 Voting for candidates who take corporate $$ from cable, oil, or insurance companies but “promise” to “hold them accountable” is like taking a rotten apple from an evil witch, believing her when she says it’s not that bad for you & hey-at least it’s fruit & not totally poisonous.

7547 2018-05-02 06:39:14 I think the more precise definintion is something like supply (crude & condensate) that can be brought online within 30 days but sustained for 90 days (i.e. hard to fit tight oil into that definition)

7550 2018-05-02 06:38:43 I think it's so important that EVERYONE knows how to fend for themselves. It don't matter if you're female or male , learn the basics like how to change the oil in your car, change a tire, clean, cook, stuff like that.. Don't just stick w/what is expected of you as man or women.
7551 2018-05-02 06:38:25 Nothing to do with oil, or Israeli state expansion. Or Saudi sectarianism?

7557 2018-05-02 06:37:37 You start with corn. Corn is good. Air popping corn takes all the corn goodness out of the popcorn leaving no goodness. Popping the corn in oil removes the corn goodness but adds oil goodness. I’m picking up what you’re putting down
7558 2018-05-02 06:37:37 The reason why STRONG PEOPLE LEADER ASSAD is vilified and “wanted out”... that’s why those thugs make up fake allegations. They want Syria devided and destroyed so it would be easier to steal the oil and gas
7559 2018-05-02 06:37:31 What a simplistic world you live in. The west creates inequality and poverty, supplies weapons and support to conflict areas where there is oil/profit, then turns its back on the victims...
7560 2018-05-02 06:37:12 If it's soft tofu, coat it in flour then fry it quickly in hot oil for a bit. You end up with something that is crisp on the outside but melts in your mouth on the inside.

7566 2018-05-02 06:35:50 Israel buys oil from the Kurds, so they clearly have a positive relationship going on.
7567 2018-05-02 06:35:35 when modi came into power may 2014 oil was 105 per BBL and low was 27 per BBL. no fall of 90/100 as you said. so fall  was 75 /80 is also for short duration. for entire modi regime benefit was around 50 USD per barral
7568 2018-05-02 06:35:08 Because you do in Nigeria what you can't do in America. You take advantage of the weak system, you don't pay your tax all your oil companies have corrupted our leaders to do your biddings. If they don't support your stealing of our resources, you will cause hell to rain.

7598 2018-05-02 06:28:45 The fuel prices are another #bcpoli failure. We need to grow up & start up all the refineries we have in BC + buy oil from AB. We need to stop acting like virtue signaling children @jjhorgan

7635 2018-05-02 06:19:43 There are no parallels. The Venezuelan collapse was a combination of a collapsed oil price and American subterfuge fueling unrest and shortages. The Zimbabwean collapse was caused by policies adopted by a by a clueless, callous and overzealous ignoramus called Mugabe.

8052 2018-05-02 05:00:35 Lol. The US has not been supportive of #Nigeria. They are the primary reason that the 5 largest producer of crude oil cannot afford fuel in their own country. And they have not made any positive impact in the fight against boko haram. It’s all lip service.

The industry recovers 20–25% of gas in place but only 8–10% of oil in place. The winners will be those who know how to use enhanced oil production, but for shale it may not be easy.

8064 2018-05-02 04:59:07 You said earlier that fusion is 20 yrs away. Now you say a century. The actual forecast from MIT is 15 years. 

You said earlier we must rely on coal and oil to fuel electric vehicles. Now you say you agree with me that we should abandon them immediately?

8074 2018-05-02 04:57:52 If that block controls the oil, the European and Asian countries that depend on ME oil will largely be at their mercy. The ChiComs have the intention to replace us as the global superpower and have already been bullying their neighbors...

8082 2018-05-02 04:56:24 Sigh. It’s the burning of fossil fuels that causes Green house gases, not products made of oil. And anyway, if I have to use a bridge to get to work and it’s  dangerous, does saying so make me a hypocrite? Of course not. That’s just silly. I can’t build a new bridge on my own.

8103 2018-05-02 04:51:24 If it was to greenwash the oil and gas industry, this was a dumb move. If it was for climate change I am curious how much of an impact this move has had.

8109 2018-05-02 04:50:07 The main problem in Venezuela is SOCIALISM. Because a good government with good economics policy never would allow make a country totally depending of oil and import. Stealing the private property, corruption and a million more problems.
8110 2018-05-02 04:49:48 they are here for notes, currency, oil, loot and not for India...  they are distributing their gains to ppl who stand for them. I believe those shouting in favour  just because their pockets being filled by these looters.  Some others being motivated in the name of religion

No, who'd subsidize big oil by building big highways and box store parking lots instead of high speed rail and urban transit for example?

8187 2018-05-02 04:35:48 That's a like. Oil companies don't get subsidized, they get to write things off on there corporate taxes. Like every company.

8200 2018-05-02 04:33:05 Simple give them nothing. Shut down all the banks with their money. And warn all oil ships going into Iran harbor to load oil will be shot out of the water. And Putin kiss my ass

8205 2018-05-02 04:32:16 It isn't unrelated. You wrote of job loss & I gave an example of different job gains. Each item I posted directly related to your original post. But good job assuming I hate oil and gas. Don't confuse how I feel about Zinke and Pruitt with how I feel about energy companies.
8206 2018-05-02 04:32:10 Or got rid of oil completely and used free energy?
8207 2018-05-02 04:31:56 Not at the expense of shutting down the oil industry.He wanted the better option to coal which was NG generation at all 4 corners of Edmonton/Calgary.

8209 2018-05-02 04:31:33 Oil companies are subsidized in many ways with buckets of money. Our taxes and our sons and daughters protect their shipping lanes. Just as bad, in my mind, is subsidizing nuclear power, which we are also doing
8210 2018-05-02 04:31:24 I don't know if you've tried CBD oil, but it works wonders.
8211 2018-05-02 04:31:12 It's ridiculous. You put fuel in your car and at the end of the month when you only used half of it, the oil company comes along and drains it out. This should be considered theft.
8212 2018-05-02 04:31:03 Glowing skin: Massage your face daily at night with almond oil and honey mixture and wash it with cold water after few minutes.
8213 2018-05-02 04:30:54 I believe world peace is attainable if we shared oil and got rid of god.

8221 2018-05-02 04:29:15 Wrong. Its a thickening agent and you need the extra starch! Never rinse pasta after cooking, at the most toss with olive oil
8222 2018-05-02 04:29:10 the science behind poking/scoring the skin& broiling it is that it achieves the same effect: the fat underneath the skin renders into oil &comes up through the holes, effectively deep frying it in the oven. problem i have is comin up with a constant repeatable recipe wrt my oven!

Next, I grab a pancake and waffle mix, the oil, some eggs and the milk, setting them all on the counter. I'm mixing everything--
8246 2018-05-02 04:25:11 Whites have the right to go anywhere in the world to kill, steal oil, and take whatever they want and if others resist them they call them terrorists, in the same time they don't want to allow people from there to come to their countries to work and live in peace!!!

8254 2018-05-02 04:23:08 The money is being made but we're not seeing it. We're paying more of our $ to pay for the oil industry innovations financed by the Carbon tax. So very neat. We even pay for their innovations. This explains why Jessica Ernst has been in court for 11 years. The system is rigged.

8256 2018-05-02 04:21:57 I think about that constantly if i can sleep through the night. I started taking cbd oil 9 days ago and my sleep is slowly getting better each night. Good luck

8283 2018-05-02 04:17:18 In 2011, companies mining tar sands siphoned approx 370M cubic meters of water from the Athabasca River alone, which was heated or converted into steam to separate the viscous oil, or bitumen, from sand formations. That exceeds the Toronto, Population 2.8M people, uses annually.
8284 2018-05-02 04:17:15 My mom bought me a jar of coconut oil and I didn’t want to open it bc it’s pretty expensive.
Anyway, I just opened it and I’m pretty disappointed ncxjks I thought it was yummy and that I’d be able to eat it from the jar like Nutella or dulce de leche but that’s not happening lol
8285 2018-05-02 04:17:08 Zip up those coveralls, Gramma. Oil ain't gonna change itself.
8286 2018-05-02 04:17:04 I am also not sure that we "need to capitalize on our resources". Why do we need to do this? The oil can stay underground. We don't need to use it up. It's like money in the bank. Why the rush when fracking boom present in US? Why produce more in a boom when not required? So odd.
8287 2018-05-02 04:16:55 microwave the olive oil in a cup for it to be luke warm and put it on ur ends !! wash out probably after 30 min - 1 hour ! it works well for me but ik we have diff hair types

8292 2018-05-02 04:15:57 Yes of course, Canada does not set global prices.   Oil and Gas are vital commodities, and 5% of the global oil supply is a large number of barrels and constitutes a economic pillar for this country.

8296 2018-05-02 04:15:08 I am so bored by hearing folks tell me that oil is responsible for all my worldly goods. So what? I mean if the planet is dead what is the point of having products everywhere? I think we need to think of the planet first and the products produced by oil less. @OilGasCanada

8304 2018-05-02 04:13:40 As far as this concerns oil prices, the market is very tight right now. If the EU also comes to the same conclusion as Macron (and Trump), then take off not 200k bpd but much more.
8305 2018-05-02 04:13:39 Space exploration *can't* depend on oil reserves, so hopefully that tech makes its way back into the general population.

8312 2018-05-02 04:12:59 So are you saying the oil industry will profit no matter what? So neat.

We are the bank for all!

8338 2018-05-02 04:08:23 The Environmental Protection Agency has granted an oil refinery owned by billionaire Carl Icahn a so-called "financial hardship" waiver. The exemption allows the facility to avoid clean air laws, potentially saving the company tens of millions of dollars.

8345 2018-05-02 04:07:35 am: Cetaphil cleanser, Aqua Glycolic toner, Cetaphil hyaluronic acid undereye cream, The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA, Herbivore Botanicals Lapis oil. Add in Drunk Elephant hydration gel in winter. Sunscreen every day.
8346 2018-05-02 04:07:34 So if the planet is going to die, we may just be stuck right now with all this political bullshitting by political parties and the dumb comments from right and left when the house is burning down. The house is our planet. And if is gone, well oil doesn't matter. @OilGasCanada
8347 2018-05-02 04:07:22 This week on "Attempting to Maintain the House While Jake's Gone" Lauren attempts to change the oil in the push mower. Join us next week to find out if it blows up because she did it wrong

8349 2018-05-02 04:07:07 try a hair masque !! or olive oil
8350 2018-05-02 04:06:57 Canada is a price taker because our oil is landlocked and the US is the only customer.  Pipelines to tidewater, ports belonging to all Canadians should be a priority and are in the national interest.
8351 2018-05-02 04:06:51 Btw, I do actually have an oil for that 
8352 2018-05-02 04:06:48 Overheard at Castle @Gormogons:

8357 2018-05-02 04:05:58 I read last year that Malaysians consume 6x more palm oil than Indonesians. Is this true? I believe it’s true bcos I see palm oil in almost everything I consume. I hv stopped drinking milk bcos it doesn’t taste like real milk
8358 2018-05-02 04:05:40 I'd love to be rubbed down with warm oil.
8359 2018-05-02 04:05:36 Add oil, Ateneo!!!
8360 2018-05-02 04:05:24 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
8361 2018-05-02 04:05:24 Then why is the ssame gas in Lynden WA only about 1.00cdn a liter. They seem to be getting our oil to refine in abundance!!! Selling it cheap too!!
8362 2018-05-02 04:05:19 In ‘08, the last time gas prices were this high, oil was at $140/barrel while Americans were paying approx. $5/gallon. Now, oil is $70/barrel, our neighbors pay $2.5/gallon & we get shafted. Why? Political leaders w/out the balls to mandate refineries & pipelines into production.
8363 2018-05-02 04:05:18 Livin' the high life off your cult members' contributions $27 at a time.

Why do you and Sanders skim money off the top of all contributions to your "endorsed" candidates?

Our Revolution/Sanders = Political Elmer Gantrys.  Got any snake oil to sell, too?
8364 2018-05-02 04:05:03 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
8365 2018-05-02 04:05:02 learning is a continuous thing... most of the things you NEED to know are not secret and are in public domain.....n Manas webinar is probably the best value for money out there....my problem is more from ppl who sell snake oil at 50k+ rupees and new traders get sucked into them
8366 2018-05-02 04:04:59 indian rupee is weakened more than one rupee to a USD & international benchmark crude oil price is up by 2$ per barrel since 24th april, 2018. Despite that daily price notification showed static petrol & diesel prices. Is this normal before every state elections Mr.@dpradhanbjp ?
8367 2018-05-02 04:04:42 campaña contra las elecciones dice en la OEA samuel moncada pero este imbesil no se da cuenta de los niveles de precios que se manejan en venezuela que son de hambre e insolitos en gaceta . estos son degenerados narcocomunistascubanochavista
8368 2018-05-02 04:04:23 Understand Daniel that Netenyahu has been saying this for years and he's been lying. Why should we fight Israel's wars? Why bomb & steal Iran's oil for our "great" oil companies? Trump was talking about stealing oil, not stopping a nuclear war. They lied about Assad, too.
8369 2018-05-02 04:04:19 @ClydeLewis . Carbon exists as graphite, diamond & fullerenes/graphenes. Coal isn't pure carbon. Anthracite comes close. "Coke", is devolitilized to essentially pure carbon. It comes either from coal, or the extreme bottom of the barrel, from oil refining. Amorphous forms too.

8374 2018-05-02 04:03:27 Would House and Senate members start an uproar if they started getting lots of annoying calls from constituents demanding that Pruitt be fired? (I know, not the ones in cost/oil/gas country, but the rest?)
8375 2018-05-02 04:03:26 Rosehip oil always has my face feeling delightful.

the being cold always hits me
blankie time and electric oil heater...

Btw I love the cold. By this time we're usually boiling in the summer desert.
8377 2018-05-02 04:03:12 Oh yea, and pricing. As I recall Natural gas and Oil/Condy were much higher than today. Royalties on a sliding scale, relative to price move on pricing. 

One way to increase price is building a pipeline to narrow differentials, both oil and natural gas carry massive diffs
8378 2018-05-02 04:02:55 Also I believe that M’sian gov r forcing companies to use palm oil in products like Fernleaf Milk. Now I haven’t seen this brand for years. Only Dutch Lady changed their recipe to satisfy the gov.

8400 2018-05-02 03:58:42 I gotcha. Oil stays up around $70 like it is drilling should continue to pick up
8401 2018-05-02 03:58:42 I'm not feeling like writing a long thread right now, but concisely:

Russia's economy is pinned to petroleum, much of which is not profitable when oil prices are low. 

Restarting Iran sanctions will decrease global oil supply.

Which will increase the ppb of oil.

That's all.

8404 2018-05-02 03:57:18 Yes Russian trolls are running America and bombing Russia’s allies in Syria and threatening the other one, Iran. They are also raising oil production to record levels, which is killing Russia’s #1 source of revenue. Finally, they are investigating how Russia got uranium from HRC.

8409 2018-05-02 03:56:49 This is shocking and embarrassing that so many Americans lack critical thinking skills. That so many can be so gullible as to be taken in by a smarmy snake oil salesman who doesn’t even attempt to sound truthful or knowledgeable. And one who breaks the law.
8410 2018-05-02 03:56:43 I don't see the harm in cooking a meal with a little VCO, eating some lean beef and a couple of whole eggs, beyond that is probably excessive...look to sources of monounsaturated fats (olive oil, macadamias, avocado), omega-3s from oily fish (salmon, mackerel, trout) + some nuts.

8417 2018-05-02 03:54:59 But it made no difference. Rebellion and hiring of NDP made no diff. We got the NDP turning into the NDPCs. So really what we are here for is to simply hire folks who work for the oil industry. @OilGasCanada I think the Tapcal Trust Fund donation folks prob = big oil companies.

They've essentially projected their business....
8424 2018-05-02 03:54:12 Everything you own was either made in part or brought to you by oil.  Every item.  And your home.  Trucks, trains, planes & ships run on fuel. And will for a long time.  We need to capitalize on our resources and move towards green infrastructure.  We can do both.

8476 2018-05-02 03:45:25 Kuwait Petroleum International (KPI) is in talks to buy 24% of Bina jointVenture refinery in MP, global oil producers are vying to gain entry into India,s expanding refining sector, Bharat Oman Refinery Ltd, have 50-50% share between Oman Oil &BPCL @narendramodi @DharmendraPradh
8477 2018-05-02 03:45:23 Have you come across Down-stream oil companies like Refineries  ( Petroleum refining.)
They have very law Margin (5-15%),but they are good businesses !
8478 2018-05-02 03:45:22 The “negative” squeaky will gets the oil ...
8479 2018-05-02 03:45:07 Anyone on here use Emu oil on their skin. I just ordered some and dont know if I should use it on my healing piercing or make it multi-use and use it in my skin
8480 2018-05-02 03:45:01 I grew up in Lidcombe. When it smelt of brewing hops the wind wind was westerly (Toohey brewery). Oil smell - northerly - Clyde refinery. Burning smell - southerly - Rookwood cemetery. Sweet smell of the sea  - easterly.

8483 2018-05-02 03:44:44 what kind of wok? round bottom/flat bottom? carbon steel/cast iron/nonstick? how many inches diameter?

i have a 16" carbon steel round bottom wok, it's good for stir frying, making fried rice and it requires less oil if you deep fry something!
8484 2018-05-02 03:44:12 Oil is stuck on a 2 USD range. Most likely it will go down but we must wait for confirmation. #Traders
8485 2018-05-02 03:43:54 Lands that people own that have been used for years. Mainly open grasslands and what not. And orangutans are endangered due to habitat loss, mainly because of deforestation. Illegal poaching and or illegal pet trade. While palm oil plantations due play a role it isn’t the biggest
8486 2018-05-02 03:43:53 Energy.  Oil/Gas supplied domestically represents security of supply.   It may not always be available from foreign sources.   Much more of it eventually should be supplied from the West, AB,BC,SK.   Canadians should support Canadians.  Governments should see this, do their bit.
8487 2018-05-02 03:43:45 i know it'd be totally bad for my skin if i exfoliated every day & it'd strip all its natural oil or whatever but i mean i wash my hair every day & it's still healthy.. is it really bad to do it or just sorta bad bc my skin is SO soft rn & my hair is always good shiny so like

“Hey, I was told that this essential oil burns like crap when you put it on skin, so be prepared for when I pour it on you when your asleep.”
8502 2018-05-02 03:41:01 No, you're saying go straight to fusion. I'm saying, cut out oil today. Use solar & electric today. Fusion might come around this century and it might not. You know as well as I do, the Koch brothers & everyone else in the oil, coal industry is pushing back against that idea.
8503 2018-05-02 03:40:59 a line up and castor oil would have done miracles
8504 2018-05-02 03:40:57 See I didnt put any oil or none after. Does it leave like a aftershave darkness ?
8505 2018-05-02 03:40:44 Doesn't fit the narrative does it? At what depth is oil considered pollution or a natural resource to be exploited?

I've got news for you: Venezuela authoritarian regime has been installed with the help of Putin and the U.S. bc of their huge oil reserves.

8523 2018-05-02 03:37:53 Governments do not do the buying of oil, oil companies do. Irving Oil made it clear that even if EE was completed it would feel free to continue purchasing Saudi oil. TCP (EE) was scooped by Enbridge and transferred its EE subscribers to Keystone. It couldn't swing two pipelines.
8524 2018-05-02 03:37:44 But what happens when you factor in the costs to society of oil? #green #wind #sun #oil #dollars #pounds #euros #pollution #health #smog #airquality #war
8525 2018-05-02 03:37:40 I love it when that happens.
8526 2018-05-02 03:37:14 Very true, I was accused of trying to take advantage of my mother after reporting her to DMV (cannot report anonymously).. the DMV deemed her safe by asking questions, no driving involved. Prayerfully she did not realize her oil light was on & motor burned up-solved that issue!

8533 2018-05-02 03:34:57 My skin is doing better now thanks to major damage control with bio oil, essential oils, aloes and sheets masks tho
8534 2018-05-02 03:34:57 An energizing facial mask, bright purple, with grape extracts, ylang ylang oil, and exfoliating sparkles. It smells strongly damp.
8535 2018-05-02 03:34:45 Does it make more sense to buy the oil from Saudi Arabia.    Oil prices go up they go down.    Acting in the economics of the moment is shortsighted.    Energy East and Northern Gateway should be revived.   Hopefully the incoming government will be smart enough to realize this.
8536 2018-05-02 03:34:40 she literally put oil to the fire 
8537 2018-05-02 03:34:28 But the explosion in Wisconsin suggest that an oil refinery, which processes 50000 barrels per day, can be very dangerous. The current Kinder Morgan pipeline processes 6 times that. But KM wants to triple that capacity to just under 900000 barrels a day= Asking for trouble
8538 2018-05-02 03:34:20 Drinking water, tea tree oil and witch hazel. Best skin care routine ever.
8539 2018-05-02 03:34:13 @gburkNM I just wanted to know if anyone has looked into why Xto,Oxy and other oil companies are sucking water straight out of the Pecos River for their frac jobs. Why are they building reserves and gonna fill them with river water don't you think this would have an impact on Nm.

8547 2018-05-02 03:33:19 The EU has a lot on the line - especially since Iran decided to stop selling its oil in USD and switched to Euros. They will not let this deal die quietly. Airbus alone has billions in sales contracts at stake.

8563 2018-05-02 03:30:02 If you're out of shaving cream, use olive oil. It works just as good, if not better.
8564 2018-05-02 03:29:47 You know it’s hot as hell in ur house when ya coconut oil start melting for no reason
8565 2018-05-02 03:29:42 Is there a link on how much wealth, or not, America’s oil production has produced?

8572 2018-05-02 03:28:34 They can and do damage the skin so I also use emu and aloe vera paste/oil, and only use jojoba mixed with a plant based tinture of lavendar, or citrus scents. Will never use regular soaps except for blue kelp soap and natural plant based shampoos and conditions

OPEC & Russia curbed production, but did they do enough to offset the impressive ramp in USA production?

8614 2018-05-02 03:23:41 Depending on the formula you gotta moisturize heavily (the one I use if oil based), also exfoliate. I use some little two step acid mini peel before the retinol. Use lots of sun screen.

8618 2018-05-02 03:23:14 Don't try condescending me with "sweetie", low blow. Do you realize how much water and land and crops it takes to raise your meat? Do you realize that palm oil consumption is the leading cause of orangutan endangerment? And your plastic? That's what's hurting the ocean.
8619 2018-05-02 03:23:08 Yes, but don't put oil on your whip!

8623 2018-05-02 03:22:52 Does putting caster oil on your eye lashes really make them grow?

8644 2018-05-02 03:19:30 Surprisingly the Pontiac Vibe I used to have was the same way. A kid in an Accord rear ended me and it folded up the hood like paper but it did nothing to the Vibe.

8654 2018-05-02 03:17:40 Gov't reports reflected that the Murray Oil accident that killled 9 was due to unsafe practices not bc of an earthquake as Murray claimed. And Murray et al took the 5th instead of accepting responsibility for their deaths.
8655 2018-05-02 03:17:38 :/ i’m sure any other edible oil works (i’ve only ever used coconut oil on my face though)
8656 2018-05-02 03:17:27 Oh..hey...that's another thing the so-called "prophets" missed... all that crude oil right under their feet that the world will someday fight for.
8657 2018-05-02 03:17:25 More water, more raw fruit and vegetables, less dairy and meat. Completely cut out fried foods (unless you cook it in olive oil). Kombucha does great to clean out your digestive tract too.
8658 2018-05-02 03:17:21 Been saying it for months but with this version of the Cavs I have no idea why teams don't force LeBron to put up 80 a night in order to beat them. He's too good of a facilitator to allow him to do both.
8659 2018-05-02 03:17:15 You are aware that Trump himself has had Pruitt lift many regulations that slowed down construction projects. Even worse, repealed the Clean Air and Water Act, and allowing oil drilling in the fragile Arctic. Coal mining, offshore drilling...it goes on and on.
8660 2018-05-02 03:17:13 Mine is messy but he is pretty good in telling me when I need to take my car in for an oil change. If you have a good trade in I’ll consider it.
8661 2018-05-02 03:17:08 Vaccines are the modern day version of snake oil.
8662 2018-05-02 03:16:52 ....so the oil companies can take it away at the pump by increased fuel prices....check it out !!
8663 2018-05-02 03:16:51 Because it's obviously a commodity. It's as much a security as oil is.
8664 2018-05-02 03:16:42 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
8665 2018-05-02 03:16:38 I'll talk about that when I am less tired though.
8666 2018-05-02 03:16:36 Trying this mayo, olive oil and egg mask for my hair
8667 2018-05-02 03:16:32 Yes.  This is not an all or nothing discussion. We can talk about drastically reducing our use of oil and fossil fuels and confining our use to essentials.
8668 2018-05-02 03:16:23 And mine also has a tow hitch that skewers radiators.
8669 2018-05-02 03:16:22 Trigun Maximum (the manga) is less rushed and I think a much more  complete story than the show was. Which makes sense. The anime had to  wrap up in 26 episodes whereas the comic went on kind of indefinitely.  Its a more complete story.

8680 2018-05-02 03:15:03 BS. Put sanctions back in place. Blockade and prevent the sale of oil. Put up or shut up.
8681 2018-05-02 03:14:54 putting on coconut oil after a bomb shower is the best 
8682 2018-05-02 03:14:53 Ask American oil companies to never pump another drop.  They have all but killed us.  I asked Sinclair to change to alternative fuel; they may just do it, if Utahans ask.

Yes, most of the mainstream media is in on it.

8700 2018-05-02 03:13:13 I can talk about that seasoning all day. Do yourself a favor and roast some TJs canellini beans in plenty of olive oil, then sprinkle on the Everything. As a white person, I am also obligated to mention avocado toast.
8701 2018-05-02 03:13:06 Baby oil
8702 2018-05-02 03:13:02 I love how my hair smells while I let coconut oil work its magic on it.

8705 2018-05-02 03:12:43 The manga (which is substantially different and kind of incoherent at times) does a better job with this. Vash kills Legato to save Livio who is essentially Wolfwood's legacy at this point. He does it because he doesn't want his bffs sacrifice to be meaningless.

8710 2018-05-02 03:11:55 I dropped my phone in oil today 
8711 2018-05-02 03:11:50 Iran shares oil with Russia and China... So not a good idea. They really don't want oil pipelines going through Syria to EU without their terms and look where we are now? Twice the price for twice the risk to me. Its not about petty differences, its all a front for oil control.
8712 2018-05-02 03:11:42 True, but you are right, I don't think NDP "decolonization" or even ban on "All Tanker Traffic" or Banning "Oil & Gas transport on the St Lawrence" can compete with stripping away constitutional rights like marriage or a child's right to stay in the closet until they are ready
8713 2018-05-02 03:11:39 They’re trying to cut out having to rely on UPS or FedEx, kind of like Rockefeller owning the rail lines to deliver his oil cheaper.
8714 2018-05-02 03:11:38 This nigga poured baby oil on his tits and started playing with his nipples during an interview and I was low-key into it
8715 2018-05-02 03:11:27 Oil prices rise on Iran sanction worries, despite surging U.S. supplies: SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday, lifted by concerns that the United States may re-impose sanctions on major exporter Iran, although soaring U.S. supplies capped gains.
8716 2018-05-02 03:11:04 Remember Airheads? Check out this ingredient list : sugar, corn syrup, maltodextrin, dextrose, modified food starch (corn), partially hydrogenated soybean oil. Contains less than 2% of: water, citric acid, artificial flavors, blue 1, red 40, yellow 5, yellow 6.
8717 2018-05-02 03:11:02 So far upon arriving back home from Cali, I’ve managed to break one of our toilets (yes..actually), shatter a glass on the counter then on to carpet, & drop my coconut oil tin (this ones nbd it was just noisy and I believe in pwr of 3’s )
8718 2018-05-02 03:10:58 Sister better put some coconut oil on that
8719 2018-05-02 03:10:58 That speaks volumes about @sonicdrivein they R standing up 4 #Education Now if we could only get these oil companies 2do that!
8720 2018-05-02 03:10:51 Exactly, so if you chip your own potatoes and ove roast or fry is butter or olive oil, you can make a relatively healthy meal that kids like. 
But it will cost you more and take longer, and looks like the same meal!
8721 2018-05-02 03:10:43 Nothing really changes. Ultimately, Vash is the same guy at the beginning of the story as he is at the end. Even his killing of Legato is underwhelming because the circumstances are so forced. Like he really has to break his non-murder code. Its just math. Kill 1 to save 2.

8724 2018-05-02 03:10:13 You prepare a feast for me in the presence of my enemies. You honor me by anointing my head with oil. My cup overflows with blessings.
8725 2018-05-02 03:09:47 Johnny Carino’s tortellini  and their bread with roasted garlic & olive oil...basically the best ever
8726 2018-05-02 03:09:34 That's not true. In 2013, one of the pipes that belongs to KM was opened, which caused said oil to spill into Burrard Inlet. 

It's simple math... Increased oil through a twinned pipeline leads to increased tanker traffic in the Inlet and an increase in something going wrong.
8727 2018-05-02 03:09:28 I've served you, you've never poured oil on our hinges; there no fool, so much as alive.
8728 2018-05-02 03:09:26 No which one? If it’s jaimacan Black castor oil yes but the one from Native Child is less than R100
8729 2018-05-02 03:09:11 The carbon tax is a penalty for driving without cause. Stop driving lol, think about it Julie . Now Alberta threatens too shut off oil to B.C.  We allready broke the record and people are stealing gas lol. MaD MAX fury road. You know who is worried More? The oil producers 
8730 2018-05-02 03:08:53 And olive oil, no?  

Really boosts the (oil soluble) flavors in the tomatoes. (and chili flakes and Tabasco... but that's taking it in a different direction entirely)
8731 2018-05-02 03:08:49 So true! Just a small drizzle of olive oil and the fresh basil is all this need!
8732 2018-05-02 03:08:42 My dad, who is a huge Eva fan thought Trigun was really dumb. I liked it as a teenager but I kind of see his point as an adult, at least regarding the anime. The themes are overly simplistic and nothing about it ever really feels satisfying. And not in that fun artistic way.

8747 2018-05-02 03:06:52 maybe it was part of the deal w/russia. trump & bibi invade iran, putin invades from the north through Georgia & Armenia & they all split the spoils. take the oil & putin gets a port to the indian ocean. maybe china is in on it too.

trump russia is obvious.

think bigger deals.

The plan worked. Knives got big into drinking and Meryl got to ride some plant dong. I gave it a 5/10 and she was mad.

8752 2018-05-02 03:06:16 Again I lied. It's social media. The safe owner is a male. I am now wondering why he did that? Perhaps he drained oil so this is a non-issue?
8753 2018-05-02 03:06:16 It’s not our fault that we live in a country full of dumb people who believe snake oil
8754 2018-05-02 03:06:03 Mafia Don has said it was a mistake not to get Iraq's oil.  Is oil the reason he is being much tougher on Iran than on North Korea?

8760 2018-05-02 03:05:08 Curly or wavy hair should use coconut oil as a conditioner because it protects new growth and adds shine.
8761 2018-05-02 03:04:43 vape oil. Please I must see
8762 2018-05-02 03:04:26 Then as soon as I start to even talk about stopping the bitch is like here let me help you and put down baby oil and banana pills   agreeing with everything I’m saying like  bitchhhh that’s what you need to
8763 2018-05-02 03:04:19 So, at the 16 OPEC meeting in Vienna, the Russians didn’t agree to these production cuts which drive oil over the magic $55/b mark they need to turn a profit? Is that Fake News?  That will come as a shock to, oh, 7.5 billion OTHER people on the planet. But you do you, shitbird.

8766 2018-05-02 03:04:04 I had a 71 Vega GT when I was in HS. Went to Myrtle Beach from W-S in Summer if ‘77. Burned more Oil than Gas. Would love to find one to restore.
8767 2018-05-02 03:03:52 Pipelines are the most environmentally friendly way to transport oil.  But if you prefer oil by rail, we are happy to oblige.  Priced accordingly, of course. 
8768 2018-05-02 03:03:49 One of the worse feelings as a woman with natural hair comes when staring at the bottom of an empty jar of coconut oil 
8769 2018-05-02 03:03:47 Meryl contributed nothing to the story but a girl at the theater camp I went to in 10th grade wrote a fanfiction that explained to me how the cowgirl position worked but also convinced me that it would only work if the girl was really short and the guy was really tall like 6'4+
8770 2018-05-02 03:03:39 For dinner tonight I had a bacon and cheese omelette (cooked in coconut oil) and it was SOOO GOOD!! Plus tomorrow marks one month without bread!! I never thought I could live without bread/muffins/rice/etc but here I am, thriving without it

8774 2018-05-02 03:03:22 I have to say, a friend brought me snacks from Japan, but I actually preferred the teapot he brought with a bamboo handle. My Italian friend always brings sppressata and very aged balsamic vinegar and the world’s best olive oil.
8775 2018-05-02 03:03:16 Walking around with a fresh lineup, moisturized, smelling like coconut oil. Can’t nobody tell me shit tonite
8776 2018-05-02 03:03:13 Prolonged #power_outages are back, exposing #PMLN Govt’s claims that it had fixed the energy sector. The fact; #Nawaz_League failed to introduce energy sector reforms. Record circular debt, dearth of furnace oil & massive losses of power companies —all underline Govt’s failure.
8777 2018-05-02 03:03:09 How Much in taxes does the oil company pay?? Just wondering??

8783 2018-05-02 03:02:30 There comes a day each year when the coconut oil transitions from a solid to a liquid while sitting in the kitchen cabinet. Today is that day. #springtime
8784 2018-05-02 03:02:24 Huh? And the republicans offer what? Deregulation of protections? Pro-business and pro oil policies while ignoring many problems in our society. I Find pro trump people are either wealthy or have a blind trust in big business and unregulated capitalism.
8785 2018-05-02 03:02:22 Was that some kind of pay-off to Iraqi's for stealing their oil--Iran government gave its people a guaranteed basic income as a share in the country's oil. Bet that makes Republicants see red.
8786 2018-05-02 03:02:13 going into JR's office just as Ewing Oil explodes from the bomb. I had nightmares in the past and during one of them, I was screaming. I didn't even know if I was screaming in my dream so trying to wake myself up.  Not realistic reaction. But I love Sue Ellen going to work for
8787 2018-05-02 03:02:08 If it doesn’t make money they don’t spend it. New York City got all its funding after hurricane Sandy because it’s the financial capital of the world, Texas got its money after Harvey because that’s where the oil refineries are. There’s little money in PR to be made.

8794 2018-05-02 03:01:02 I still like Wolfwood but his death is kind of dumb. The guy was tanking hits way worse than just one bullet earlier. He fucked up a robot with rocket launcher legs. I think he just wanted to get away from Vash's blandness honestly.
8795 2018-05-02 03:00:56 Because you're saying not to go to solar & electric vehicles and go straight to fusion. Fusion is still a long way to go, solar & electric is already here. Invest & research better batteries & panels. Why wait for fusion to ween off of oil?

8801 2018-05-02 03:00:19 Does it bother anyone else that we are destroying whole rainforest just so our fat asses can eat more chicken nuggest? Is palm oil more important than whole ecosystems?

8808 2018-05-02 02:58:59 As a 13 year old, the chain smoking alcoholic priest/assassin Wolfwood is what pulled me in. Similar to Asuka in Eva, he doesn't get introduced until Episode 8, then randomly disappears for a while. He has a cross that's also a gun and looks kind of like Nomar Garciaparra.
8809 2018-05-02 02:58:58 Corn salsa, prepped sliced avocado (sprinkled with lime salt and olive oil), seared sirloin, chicken cutlets, bacon.

8811 2018-05-02 02:58:30 Common misconception: acrylic paint is better to use then oil (body absorption wise)
False: you are actually breathing in plastic fumes. It's actually worse in some cases.
8812 2018-05-02 02:58:26 Pruitt was suing EPA with oil lobbyist drafted arguments b/f Trump made him the head of the EPA. But Pruitt has become a raging oil-filled dumpster fire so my guess is those same same oil companies do--or will soon--prefer someone with a lesser Gaddafi penchant.
8813 2018-05-02 02:58:11 OIL RIG @sheamauser
8814 2018-05-02 02:58:04 I especially enjoy the cover photo they chose for this article; it captures his essence. He looks like the slimiest snake oil salesman alive.
8815 2018-05-02 02:58:00 And where are you going to get electric vehicles without mining and without powering our electric grid on solar and oil?
8816 2018-05-02 02:57:59 Less oil fat, big difference. Progressive for a couple yrs, but also filled with alot weird chemical ingredients now I need to eat cleaner. Stricter, very strict.
8817 2018-05-02 02:57:23 Sure, they could have picked a nicer color. What's real is it will provide reliable, carbon free, power to 100 000 people while providing them with clean drinking water and a cleaner way to mine oil they would be mining no matter what power source they use. What's in your ship?
8818 2018-05-02 02:57:23 My first priority is to find high IVR ETFs. But I also try to have diversified assets on—gold, oil, euro, bonds. At 10 delta they are still very high probability trades, they’ll just take longer without an IVR pop.
8819 2018-05-02 02:57:22 Coconut oil doesn’t do will with my skin but tea tree oil is bombbb! For sure using oils tonight thank ya girly
8820 2018-05-02 02:57:12 Also, the firearms should be stored muzzle down to prevent oil from leaking into the firing mechanism.
8821 2018-05-02 02:56:49 That's not fair. How will they ever get corrupted if you just walk away from them in disgust? Take a breather, realize it is not their fault, and then check their oil with your ring pop.
8822 2018-05-02 02:56:43 I think I’m going to try castor oil for my lashes and brows
8823 2018-05-02 02:56:41 @Eric__Smith The fact VanVleet took those two shots & clearly looked as though he reaggraveted his injury earlier in the 2nd half after being knocked down, Miles has to become an option from the outside. Can't win w/ two guys who are willing to shot from outside.

8829 2018-05-02 02:55:39 face oils are the wave. esp coconut oil and tea tree. i also use any type of flower hydration oil on my skin as well when i need it to be extra poppin. very natural way of getting your skin to its fullest. also rose waters are v excellent for you esp before or after makeup
8830 2018-05-02 02:55:18 Well, I’m for recreational CBD Oil. Take that liberals!
8831 2018-05-02 02:55:14 Its really hard to root against his much more interesting brother or whoever the villain of the week is pre-gung ho guns when Vash is so overpowered and annoying. I'd have taken the Gung-Ho Gun Power Hour over Vash's bullshit any day.
8832 2018-05-02 02:55:09 Welp, now you have the proverbial oxymoron. You can't shut down oil production and wait for fusion without having a viable alternative to oil. How are you going to do that? Electric vehicles and solar.
8833 2018-05-02 02:54:56 Pearson Sharp's reporting on oil in Syria raises questions about US reasons for remaining there. Why not negotiate royalties instead of war?
8834 2018-05-02 02:54:55 Why what's wrong with your kitty please  don't  give up hope cause mom y dog had tumor in her pancreas  and oil prayed for her she lived 5 more years so whatever illness is please  get a second opinion  first.even if u kitty does pass u kitty soul as always be with u.

8838 2018-05-02 02:54:12 I literally said let's abandon them 50 years ago. I never ever said we should keep mining coal and oil.
8839 2018-05-02 02:54:07 Oh yea establish EPA in Oklahoma, at least his oil buddies can visit often! Won’t be happy till he sets us back 50 years.
8840 2018-05-02 02:53:57 Olive oil black pepper.
8841 2018-05-02 02:53:55 YES! Don’t forget to mix magnesium oil with something else to avoid dry/itchy skin (ask me how I know). Lavender oil is a good mix, too. I apply it to the soles of my feet before bedtime. Helps with sleep and joint pain. Feel better Soledad!
8842 2018-05-02 02:53:50 Even conservatives will close the oil patch. They will have to but they will drag out the inevitable.
8843 2018-05-02 02:53:50 seriously, when people at work tell me they're on the keto diet in my head i'm just like oh ok so you're basically on the meat cheese and oil diet, good call
8844 2018-05-02 02:53:34 coconut oil smells like heaven
8845 2018-05-02 02:53:32 In truth, the only truly decent episodes of Trigun are the ones with Wolfwood in them. Vash isn't an interesting character and kind of sums up everything I dislike about anime. "Oh look at me I'm such a goof and I'm horny and I love food but also look at my magic gun powers!"
8846 2018-05-02 02:53:31 I want both,smother me and let me oil and slide between those chocolate beauties
8847 2018-05-02 02:53:26 Terrible.  They look like a high school team running plays at the end
8848 2018-05-02 02:53:21 That’s not my point at all, but I don’t believe the anti-transit campaign has any interest in seeing a real transit plan. They were supported by auto dealers and (possibly) big oil (who knows where that money came from).

8861 2018-05-02 02:50:50 Me tooooo my nail lady is always telling me to wash them less like bitch whettttt. I always put cuticle oil and lotion on before I knock out lol
8862 2018-05-02 02:50:39 Take your ball and go home then, your tweets are so immature. Us true Americans see right through guys like you. Sad, so many are duped by your snake oil politics.
8863 2018-05-02 02:50:37 The Trigun anime is weird for a lot of reasons. I have no idea how its so popular, frequently compared to Cowboy Bebop which might be the single most accessible adult series that Japan has for western audiences. I suspect their similar time slots on Adult Swim in the 2000s is why
8864 2018-05-02 02:50:29 I use coco butter and vitamin e oil.  I credit staying active to making this all feel good and not feeling sick
8865 2018-05-02 02:50:24 why do you keep thinking I'm pro oil and coal? We should have ended it 50 years ago.
8866 2018-05-02 02:50:22 Oil supplies and fossil energy need not last indefinitely as they will be replaced with cleaner sources like nuclear. We have plenty of fossil fuel to cover the transition to fission and fission will cover the transition to fusion.
8867 2018-05-02 02:50:04 Coconut oil has become essential I was super late on that wave
8868 2018-05-02 02:49:58 wow I’m gonna take this warm shower, put some peppermint oil on my back, and lay wrapped in my blankets like a burrito
8869 2018-05-02 02:49:50 Tar sands and all oil is an abomination and is destroying our world. We should shut down all oil production immediately and prioritize fusion.
8870 2018-05-02 02:49:43 I was asked to create a wish list for Mother's Day and upcoming birthday. Things on it: a wool mop, 3 different kinds of oil lamps, a dry iron, recycled rubber stair treads, slippers and a wind chime. Because apparently I'm a 90 year old farm woman? I guess?
8871 2018-05-02 02:49:43 Sorry... we have every interest in the ME our entire society is built on the fact that if anyone wants to buy oil they have to buy dollars first. Saudi Arabia props up our make believe economy buy only trading with dollars. Petro dollar is why we go to war.

8873 2018-05-02 02:49:14 No justice on stolen land, just as long as it doesn't affect profits. Did Standing Rock not matter? You're Native but more worried about oil & coal, that's pretty awesome of you.
8874 2018-05-02 02:49:09 Aw thank you girl! I swear it’s that Argan oil!
8875 2018-05-02 02:49:08 I like the picture of the kids still sleeping that is very cute I like poetry and art myself my Grandma had taught me sketching and try to get me into oil painting I like Picasso
8876 2018-05-02 02:49:04 Where’s the olive oil??
8877 2018-05-02 02:49:02 omg yeah that oil looks pretty bad now that I see it D: Ive had this stuff a lot

8881 2018-05-02 02:48:29 Oil and gas? I hope it's not the new scam.
8882 2018-05-02 02:48:15 Ummm oil?
8883 2018-05-02 02:48:10 I originally watched Trigun as a trade in 9th grade. I borrowed the DVDs from my neighbor and in exchange, she had to watch Evangelion. Her overall review was "I think Shinji is one of those guys that gets off on hurting women". We were 13 and 14 respectively.
8884 2018-05-02 02:48:07 I just spent $70 on essential oil vapes from @myMONQ bc that's just who I am now
8885 2018-05-02 02:47:53 Paint Stock seems getting demand slowly even crude oil is boiling.
Though Asian Paint @ 1201 disappointed since last two year & noe getting buying interest.
Berger Paint @286 near 52 week high.
8886 2018-05-02 02:47:49 Needed to do it sooner unfortunately. Squeaky wheel gets the oil.
8887 2018-05-02 02:47:42 I hella recommend coconut oil for everyone and anything when it comes to skin...they should pay me to advertise 
8888 2018-05-02 02:47:38 Exactly, you're pushing for the continuation of oil & coal "until" fusion is a reality. So, yes, whose side are you on. Since you're an engineer, then you know all about the cheap tar sands.
8889 2018-05-02 02:47:21 Wasn't it suppose to end tomorrow? RG must really be burning the midnight oil.
8890 2018-05-02 02:47:20 Coconut oil hair mask ftw! #selfcare
8891 2018-05-02 02:47:19 I got a 5mL free sample of this face oil and I went on Sephora to see how much a full bottle costs and ITS $105 FOR A 30mL BOTTLE THE FUCK THIS SAMPLE IS LIKE A $17 VALUE

8893 2018-05-02 02:46:41 Never suggested it was a guarantee, rather that they had a much better shot at trying to beat Lebron this time around. That said, one game doesn't make a series.
8894 2018-05-02 02:46:35 Lol where’s the smoke? 

That’s about to be the most relaxing massage oil in a few hours.
8895 2018-05-02 02:46:33 use a mixture of fresh squeezed lemon juice, coconut oil, apple cider vinegar, & aloe vera.
8896 2018-05-02 02:46:32 He lied sir. He made reference to the fact that they're waiting on the revenue from oil. I believe the northern youths are not that concerned about the OIL, ridiculous attempt at a PR spin.
8897 2018-05-02 02:45:42 The idea is if every fuel operates cars equipped with filter that collects the C02 from it and by the time they making oil change it will emptied and collect by the auto shop and eventually collected by recycling company to the final process.
8898 2018-05-02 02:45:39 coconut oil clogs ur pores sweaty 
8899 2018-05-02 02:45:26 Today my papa got my AC in my car fixed (praise God), got my tire fixed, my oil changed AND filled up my car for me. I love him to the moon and back, and I would be lost without him

8903 2018-05-02 02:45:00 A squeaky gear gets the oil. Make noise. Let people know you’re here. But don’t be too loud cuz, you know, massa
8904 2018-05-02 02:44:48 I make tamales. Lard is used in the masa. Some use oil, but I prefer lard. That’s excessive oil or lard.

8906 2018-05-02 02:44:33 Hey @VinnieTortorich I’m a truck driver it’s hard to not snack. I’ve been taking a spoonful of coconut oil to curb my cravings. Over a 8 hour period I eat 8 tablespoons. Is there a limit on how much you can eat?
8907 2018-05-02 02:44:17 Raptors have only two guys who are willing to shot the ball from outside the paint...hence the lack of ball movement.
8908 2018-05-02 02:44:15 I'm going to spend some time talking about Trigun now. I don't know when I will stop. I might stop for a bit and then go to sleep and start up again on my morning commute.

8913 2018-05-02 02:43:31 Only olive oil for my salads. Everything else drowns out the flavour of the salad and is too vinegary.
8914 2018-05-02 02:43:22 Oil patch must close? Do you live in a pineapple under the sea?
8915 2018-05-02 02:43:13 Seen this movie before.  They don’t know how to win.  I tried telling u bro
8916 2018-05-02 02:42:54 The economy crashed Q4 ‘08 taking $/bl with it. As the economy surged oil prices went back to Bush levels. Then 9/11/14 Kerry met with the Saudis and negotiated to open the spigots. Prices rise now for opposite reason as Putin and Saudis met Decembernof 16, restricted supply.

8920 2018-05-02 02:42:38 Listen to prunk. Magnesium oil fixes things. Learned with our son on the spectrum. And until two years ago, acupuncture was mythology to me. But no longer. I’m a witness.

8922 2018-05-02 02:42:29 I use motor oil myself.
8923 2018-05-02 02:42:08 Except in forrest fires where you actually light fires to stop fires. You can also fight oil well fires with dynamite. Of course they used to teach kids this in science class before they started spending weeks discussing what gender you want to be. 
8924 2018-05-02 02:42:04 This why the British govt and their jihadists won't let go after AMALGAMATION which expired 2014. The British Govt want to continue stealing oil and the jihadists want them to become moslems. That is what Potus45 was talking about in Nigeria.
8925 2018-05-02 02:41:38 oh shit. sorry to hear that. Yeah my local Asian mart carries these and our oil was separated and neither my husband or I got sick after eating them.  :(
8926 2018-05-02 02:41:25 “so i’m sitting there coconut oil on my titties”

8929 2018-05-02 02:41:05 My recruited opponent took PAC $. Search the PAC you find only a list of names.  Search the corporate and LLP names you find they worked for the Koch brothers and offshore oil drillers who opposed the moratorium in the Gulf after Deepwater Horizon. I wonder if she even knows.

8932 2018-05-02 02:40:45 I have an essential oils toner an essential oils serum and then I use coconut oil as a moisturizer and it’s been working pretty well so far. I can get you the recipe from my mom if you want
8933 2018-05-02 02:40:40 Home made: oil/balsamic vinegar/minced garlic, honey/mustard, Greek yogurt/avocado/lemon. 
8934 2018-05-02 02:40:32 That's true although they quickly realized their mistake and rolled those changes back. Interest rate is set by Bank of Canada last time I checked. Poloz was quick to lower rate twice when oil went down, now it is up again, where are the hikes?
8935 2018-05-02 02:40:30 Same reason most athletes do...pressue of the moment
8936 2018-05-02 02:40:26 Try the eco gel w/ flaxseed & castor oil gel. It doesn’t get white nor get hard & it promotes hair growth. As I Am has good products & Camille Rose.

8941 2018-05-02 02:39:41 And Calgary's woes are from decades of irresponsible management of the oil wealth. Booms always end. The PCs should have told you that. Always.
8942 2018-05-02 02:39:39 The Trump administration does not care. Period. He's there to destroy the EPA, and big oil, big coal, & big chemical are happy with him.

8949 2018-05-02 02:38:31 Why hello there dear sister. Care for some crackers and sardines cooked in oil? A specialty I got to learn from one of the hippogriffs of Hippogriffia in the other equestria.
8950 2018-05-02 02:38:25 Does regular castor oil make your lashes grow or does it have to be Jamaican black castor oil? 
8951 2018-05-02 02:38:13 I know I have been sniffing peppermint essential oil and diffusing it , a nice rain  would wash it away.
8952 2018-05-02 02:38:11 And the uptime indicator is Gundlach yapping his beak at every event microphone  to buy energy related ETFs after oil is up 150% in 18 months....
8953 2018-05-02 02:38:05 The oil companies?
8954 2018-05-02 02:37:56 Oil & gas companies?
8955 2018-05-02 02:37:53 Nothing beats a compliment after a goddamn hardwork and burning-the-midnight-oil hours.

8960 2018-05-02 02:37:19 Awesome. Remember to take pics!

PS. Drizzle with olive oil right before throwing it on the grill. I find that helps to give the spice coating a "crust" pop.
8961 2018-05-02 02:37:09 I’ll find more joy when the pipeline is built! And when you find an industry that is comparable to the oil and gas industry in providing jobs and EQUAL opportunity for all. @WBrettWilson right? #buildKM @rally4resources
8962 2018-05-02 02:36:56 That would be good but we're not there. It's got to be built along side the oil industry not in the absence of. Oh, and it's got to be affordable and accessible, which it isn't.
8963 2018-05-02 02:36:55 I wants no parts of that pussy mama I heard it’s over due for an oil change n got a leak
8964 2018-05-02 02:36:55 Ummmmm , just ketchup mixed with coconut oil.
8965 2018-05-02 02:36:51 Important to make this available to those in need. The oil does great things for those with this seizure disorder. The Democrat approach is medical first and then push for decriminalization of recreational. We don’t want that in Alabama. We don’t want to be California!

8972 2018-05-02 02:35:55 Yeah man let me put it to you like this. I got moms a 96 Benz S420 right. A 96! Her oil change at the dealership was $97. And that was a discount! we won’t even get into parts. I def know your struggle.

8989 2018-05-02 02:33:14 I saw it in a review and bought it for that reason. The almond oil or whatever gives a pretty sheen
8990 2018-05-02 02:33:10 Sorry Laura but I believe Al Gore has gone to ground. He's busy washing the egg off his face.

8997 2018-05-02 02:32:10 I was just taking my makeup off and got coconut oil in my eYe
8998 2018-05-02 02:32:05 That is a short path distillation set up. I am a farmer playing scientist so it’s not very fancy , but I try  It’s the exact same principle of oil refineries. Fractional distillation to isolate individual compounds through distillation .
8999 2018-05-02 02:32:02 It's a repercussion from the knee jerk trade war that 'you know who' started. So, countries that are oil producing are hitting us hard.
9000 2018-05-02 02:32:01 We get most of our oil from Canada.

9010 2018-05-02 02:30:06 I was too young for the vaccine—let me rephrase. At 49 they didn’t offer them for those under 50. The dr said I’d have them again more than likely. Learned how to deal with them. Forget a tepid bath. Get it so hot that they rupture, and then soak them down with tea tree oil.

9019 2018-05-02 02:28:56 Fair comment. We’ve never paid for both the externalities of carbon based fuel or the massive subsidies afforded the oil and gas and power sectors.  However, on an LCOE basis we are now hitting parity between renewables and hydrocarbons.
9020 2018-05-02 02:28:53 I just put lavender oil on the sides of my sleep mask, boy am I about to knock out
9021 2018-05-02 02:28:51 Did you know? #Venezuela oil output has fallen quarter in half a year. Astonishing. It seems the regime is waging economic war on itself.

9024 2018-05-02 02:28:25 and Big Oil are getting every tax break known to man. Elect a Republican as President and gas always goes up every time. I'm sure putting a chickenhawk like Bolton is the White House has the markets nervous as it should.
9025 2018-05-02 02:28:13 It’s so warm in our house that the jar of Coconut Oil I had on the table melted.

9075 2018-05-02 02:21:16 There were the changes to the Foreign Investment rules in 2012. There has been selling off of assets in recent years, more to do with the global pricing of oil. Canadian companies have been buying them which is a good thing.The avg tax difference is .7 percent.between CDN and US

9097 2018-05-02 02:18:21 Yes, I use electricity. It's mostly coal generated, which also needs to be replaced by renewables. Shipping oil through a pipeline destined for foreign export contributes nothing to either my power or travel needs.
9098 2018-05-02 02:18:01 It's always fun when someone on #Chopped gets dragged for using sesame oil.

9103 2018-05-02 02:17:13 I live in OK. Even the oil and gas concerns here admit wastewater from fracking can & does contaminate ground water & aquifers.

9106 2018-05-02 02:16:32 Crude oil did not move higher off the trend line and as a result moved below the trend line. There are a couple fibs showing a downtrend. I will see how it acts tomorrow before I decide which direction to trade it.
9107 2018-05-02 02:16:23 What happens to oil when DXY rockets up?
9108 2018-05-02 02:16:08 No, go sustainable.  Vegan doesn’t stop this from happening.  Palm oil is vegan.
9109 2018-05-02 02:16:05 .....you’re supposed to do this anyway. The reason your skin is oily is probably bc you need to moisturize more then you actually do. Your skin is just hella dry and your body is reacting by producing more oil than necessary. 
9110 2018-05-02 02:16:01 Clinton is tbh by far the most conservative Democrat. This is why everybody preferred Bernie Sanders. Too bad the senate dislikes Sanders because he is opposed to the war for oil.

9114 2018-05-02 02:15:16 If you come into contact with something that is 97% oil and 3% something else, you would correctly assume that 3% of something had been added to that oil, correct. (Extremely dumbed down version.)

9122 2018-05-02 02:13:45 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ watched a YT vid of a girl who put it on her brows lol OR try a castor oil, coconut oil, and vitamin e mixture (works for lashes)

9127 2018-05-02 02:13:24 One interesting news that caught my eye was Aramco, the world's largest oil producer in Saudi Arabia, picking up a major stake in a $44 bln refinery in Maharashtra - set to become one of the largest in the world.
9128 2018-05-02 02:13:22 Cleatus the span of what we're already friends i can't wait for 900 dollars I've delayed getting an oil change for like to
9129 2018-05-02 02:13:16 Okay but price was this high a few years back without carbon tax or carbon pricing. Current increase related to refinery issues and supply. Time to go after oil company price fixing.. pretty  clear based on how prices go up.

9131 2018-05-02 02:12:59 don't you mean coconut oil
9132 2018-05-02 02:12:46 You can achieve the same effect by mixing some lavender oil and water and spraying it on your pillow. Or use a diffuser. It was just easier for me to find it in dry form here.
9133 2018-05-02 02:12:27 A quick easy way is with Sage. It serves as a Ward. I don't know if you randomly have sage leaves around so of you have a candle and sage oil burn it and the aroma should help till you find a permanent solution
9134 2018-05-02 02:12:24 Inflation is relevant to one item (a house or oil) but not to an economy? In the same way that the idea of brilliant is relevant to specific topics (e.g., particle physics or the tango) but irrelevant as a general predictor (e.g., so she'll be good a conversation).
I like it.

9137 2018-05-02 02:12:15 Ghee tastes more animal. If you use small amt to oil pan (ghee =higher heat pt), the taste disappears into whatever flesh you're cooking. It's overkill but I've used small amt ghee in cast iron and cooked canned sardines or tuna in it to crisp it up.
9138 2018-05-02 02:12:01 Cannabis oil is usually made from single-bladed "sugar leaves," which are high in THC and grow in the buds of a marijuana plant.
9139 2018-05-02 02:11:46 That reminds me of the fish oil capsule I punctured. RANCID. threw them away. Use liquid fish oil but may stop that as I’m eating more Salmon.

I won't do the pledge itself because some people that know me are in the oil industry and I drove for Sinclair Oil too. But I won't take strings or favors.

9154 2018-05-02 02:08:58 What’s magnesium oil?
9155 2018-05-02 02:08:52 By all means its a scape goat. And prices across Canada should always be within 10 cents. But thats not our choice. Being able to move oil will bring price down. It provides an extra 15 billion a year to the country.
9156 2018-05-02 02:08:32 Brilliant. Maybe some snake oil under eye cream?
9157 2018-05-02 02:08:26 magnesium oil, acupuncture, TENS device and prayer. yes, but not like before.
9158 2018-05-02 02:08:03 Not true unless the implied conclusion is that all types of unrefined crude are just bad, sure. "Crude" is NOT the name of a chemical compound. It is a product of decay of a mixture of organic plants & animals. Bacteria and enzymes "make" the oil & it will vary in composition.
9159 2018-05-02 02:08:00 Have you tried COCONUT OIL

9171 2018-05-02 02:06:15 Hear ya. Tylenol for serious sciatica, huh uh. Actually, I don't see any benefit from Tylenol at all. I'm wondering about the CBD oil stuff.  I don't like pot, paranoid but if that stuff would work , that would be cool.  We're in a time of change, for sure.
9172 2018-05-02 02:06:09 What JT meant when he was going to deficit spend to make our economy grow. Shy on details this was end game. Pension funds to toss at the oil company just for the glory of saying he got the pipe to the coast. That's real innovative dreamer schemer.
9173 2018-05-02 02:06:04 Yeah he’s dumb. Like straight up he just is getting grifted by the big brained alt-right who’s MO is attacking and isolating those who have influence to be their snake oil salesmen.

9189 2018-05-02 02:04:01 Purple dye is now in. This one doesn't come with a post-dye conditioner, so it's a good thing I grabbed a packet of coconut oil conditioner with everything else. 
Though based on how it feels applied, it may be more of a Manic Panic style dye where it dyes as a conditioner.
9190 2018-05-02 02:03:49 I ran out of oil :/ maybe if I can scrape something it will do something. Not getting new Carts until Friday lol

9208 2018-05-02 02:01:00 If the leftwing zealots just realigned their thought process and considered that the oil sands are nature's own oil spill and all we are doing is cleaning it up.
As the deposits are barely subsurface the land once cleaned of the bitumen is in far better shape.

9215 2018-05-02 02:00:06 I heard that gasoline was up to over $1.60 in B.C. and the first thing that I thought was that it's extortion. The Oil Industry is punishing B.C. for not taking the shaft - er - um...  Pipelines.

9224 2018-05-02 01:58:52 Canada's economy is in rebound mode ... "led by gains in the mining and oil and gas extraction sector." Trudeau and his 22 Minutes retards will put and end to that ...

9226 2018-05-02 01:58:37 This is how Trudeau plans on ending our oil industry, so obvious by making gasoline too expensive so you have no choice but to accept his green energy utopia
9227 2018-05-02 01:58:08 Don't forget the Golan Heights (oil) & it's black op attacks on Syria. The Jewish people are in danger from the Netanyahu's of our world. Jews deserve a homeland, but at the cost of a world war that will destroy all humanity?

9235 2018-05-02 01:56:51 When your mind is the engine that makes things go, you don’t need to feel guilty about letting off the gas and putting oil in. We don’t feel guilty when we maintain other important assets. And the self the most valuable asset.
9236 2018-05-02 01:56:43 People that wanna compare the Oil to Nash or Winnipeg— we don’t have a Dman as good as any of their top 3.  Nurse is coming but D cores aren’t comparable.

9251 2018-05-02 01:54:13 it’s really good! all i did was blend the cauliflower, sauté onion, garlic, green & red bell pepper in olive oil then added the chopped cauli then let it simmer for 5-10mins then let it rest for another 5 & that was it lol so easy!

9259 2018-05-02 01:52:56 Anyone wondering if Trump is letting gas prices stay high so he can bully people into allowing oil companies to destroy our land, sea and wildlife?
9260 2018-05-02 01:52:35 Similar experience with my Jeep and a Nissan
9261 2018-05-02 01:52:10 And you can spend that $1.50 toward $4 a gallon gas. Why is it going to $4 a gallon? Because Trump won’t do shit to keep oil companies  from price gouging. Tell me I’m wrong, then wait a year, and see how much you’re paying. To the GOP, American consumers exit to be screwed.

9310 2018-05-02 01:45:37 Few drops of warm olive oil? I remember reading this somewhere so I Googled it and it actually does relieve the pain in some cases--maybe hold him over until tomorrow?
9311 2018-05-02 01:45:27 Does anybody know of any black owned business that makes jasmine body oil? Cause I have a need.
9312 2018-05-02 01:44:41 アロマのBodyとFaceのCare用に大きなOlive Oilを買って、いろんな精油を混ぜて使用してました。偶然に見た今の聖書の箇所にOlive oilをかけると書いてあったから、本当にびっくりです。昨夜それをアロマの会報誌で見て、ちょうど思い出したとこだったから。
9313 2018-05-02 01:44:40 Not my first horror, but I was still young when I saw it and that oil slick monster scared the ever loving shit out of me.
9314 2018-05-02 01:44:38 Bro stop talking shit, Iran only need three misses to destroy your whole country, one for your oil one for you fresh water and one for your capital
9315 2018-05-02 01:44:37 It almost doesn't matter.A gov't of any stripe must eventually put a high price on C.The foot draggers simply cause more intermediate damage and when they finally wake up from denial, the adjustments will be that much more drastic.The oil patch must close. On borrowed time.
9316 2018-05-02 01:44:27 IF YOU CANT FIND A GOOD WAY TO MINE COAL OR DRILL FOR OIL THEN STOP DUDE. Fogure it the fuck out
9317 2018-05-02 01:44:26 Spray the wall with vegetable oil!
9318 2018-05-02 01:44:24 apaka klu aq jual avocado oil q yg baru akan ada yg beli :(
9319 2018-05-02 01:44:08 Lovin' an all electric car... Even more so when my oil burner drops 1/2 quart of oil in the garage (this is the third time!) That bay is a mess of oil and dirt and I'll have to also burn time yet again to (re)change the oil.
9320 2018-05-02 01:43:56 I’ve got lavender in the essential oil diffuser, and frankincense+cedar incense burning.

My apartment is a smorgasbord of smells.
9321 2018-05-02 01:43:53 rub me down with that lotion, baby oil me

9323 2018-05-02 01:43:46 Try spritzing your face with a DIY soothing spray made of witch hazel, peppermint and lavender essential oils, baby oil, and organic chamomile tea. I hear that men love DIY-ing things, too, so they’ll get double the stress relief.
9324 2018-05-02 01:43:36 excrise a lot & walk as much as possible! it makes for an easier birth. plus it helps getting your body back to normal, rub coconut oil/lotion on your body every night to prevent stretch marks.
9325 2018-05-02 01:43:29 I find him pretty unpleasant but I'm not sure if it's censored or not. He did go into great detail about the young girl and baby oil
9326 2018-05-02 01:43:28 A8 In Athens my mom and I were lucky enough to cook up a traditional Greek Sunday dinner with a  housewife in her home. She made her own olive oil and used fresh lemons from her yard. Best meal. #InspireToWander

9329 2018-05-02 01:42:48 Both working because the Fed has devalued our money by 80% in the last 40 years? If our money is unhook from oil, the Weimar repub look tame
9330 2018-05-02 01:42:44 soak ya roach stompers in coconut oil for 10mins and it's gonna come out
9331 2018-05-02 01:42:34 I’ll be tin man  I need my can of oil
9332 2018-05-02 01:42:31 When I was in primary school we used to do similar things with oil paint, I don't remember what the liquid was put it in. We then used the paper to cover our text books!
9333 2018-05-02 01:42:24 If you could do that then enlighten us. the power generation is connected on multiple factors RPP, IPP, furnace oil generation, coal power generation, hydro power generation, atomic power generation, all these sources cost and efficiency cost of generation etc.
9334 2018-05-02 01:41:48 รอได้จร้าาา
9335 2018-05-02 01:41:41 本日もメニューは、添加励磁のＶＶＶＦ添え。香りづけにレジンシューを使用しましたｗｗｗ
香りとともにお楽しみくださいｗｗｗ
9336 2018-05-02 01:41:40 聖書にはOlive Oilとなってて、私はイタリア料理が好きでいつもオイルはOlive oilを使ってるから、以前から聖書にオリーブがよく出てくるのを知ってたんで、私のそういうところは神様から来てるんだろうなって直感してた。アロマでもOlive oilはBodyやFaceマッサージ用に使うから私は持ってました
9337 2018-05-02 01:41:38 I'd never heard of this expression before today. Thanks for the education. Even more thanks for that oil tanker of a burrito.
9338 2018-05-02 01:41:06 うわぁとても行きたいですが新幹線なので我慢します…
残りもう少しですね！(まだ仕上げもあると仰ってたのでまだ作業は残ってると思いますが)本当に応援しています
9339 2018-05-02 01:40:45 今度はどのシリーズだろーなぁ。
気になるぜ！！
9340 2018-05-02 01:40:36 New meaning of digging for oil.    #oil.   #stuck
9341 2018-05-02 01:40:18 今日午後からゲリラサラダ油来るらしいよ。
9342 2018-05-02 01:40:13 High gas prices are tough on all of us, but for people in Alberta things are even worse. 

Trudeau is doing his best to ship all of our oil patch jobs to south of the border.

Sad.
9343 2018-05-02 01:40:04 @RitaSofiale oil you pass dry rejection
9344 2018-05-02 01:40:04 I am convinced the ice at MTS Centre is covered in oil slicks.
9345 2018-05-02 01:39:38 Concrete boxing timber. Trademe. A dime a dozen. Still has concrete on it. Add oil... SHAZZAM!
9346 2018-05-02 01:39:07 pretty sure my entire persona smells like tea tree oil at this point
9347 2018-05-02 01:39:02 仲間の嗅覚www
9348 2018-05-02 01:38:54 I'm kind of scared of using rosehip oil because I developed such a big dry patch after using it... but it also made me glow
9349 2018-05-02 01:38:48 I need to try that oil for my breast
9350 2018-05-02 01:38:38 Popcorn popped in coconut oil on the stove is my favorite lazy low-cal dinner!
9351 2018-05-02 01:38:12 You got that grump old man syndrome down pat buddy. I pray your oil change didn’t cost $29.01 and you gave then $30.00 cash. Would like to have seen how that played out....
9352 2018-05-02 01:38:12 I cleaned my fridge, kitchen, living room and dining room tonight. I lit some candles and have my oil diffuser going and I couldn’t be happier. Adulting at its finest 
9353 2018-05-02 01:38:07 yea it’s kinda like oil pulling? using coconut oil to clean your mouth. you can make a paste with grounded turmeric (it’s a seasoning you can find a grocery store) & coconut oil. brush, leave it on for 5 mins and rinse. let me see if I can find a video that may explain better
9354 2018-05-02 01:37:23 So grateful for that oil painting and darth
9355 2018-05-02 01:37:06 I had to learn to change a tire and change the oil.
9356 2018-05-02 01:37:03 The term monopoly refers to a company who gains ownership of the majority of a goods or service and escalates the prices, giving their customers no choice but to pay extra. For example, Standard Oil owned most of the oil industry and was forced to break up.
9357 2018-05-02 01:37:01 be well and grape seed oil cures that shiiii
9358 2018-05-02 01:37:01 mau ikut2 an takut kaya yg face oil dulu, yg lain pd bagus di aku malah ga cocok:(
9359 2018-05-02 01:36:51 I wish I had a PS4 because Detroit: Becoming Human looks so good - the demo y'all omggg
9360 2018-05-02 01:36:43 The point of oil exploration isn’t domestic price sensitivity. It’s about jobs and paying for all the social welfare goodies that people want.
9361 2018-05-02 01:36:33 Had to go all over Brooklyn to find some coconut oil. 
9362 2018-05-02 01:36:31 I don't know why you keep bringing middle East murder into this - excuse my ignorance. This is about Alberta and BC. Oil dependence is a dead end. We need to shift away from it.
9363 2018-05-02 01:36:30 That Ricsyung moment though... Gotta love the water & oil ship...  #SHINHWA
9364 2018-05-02 01:36:23 These good folks can't drain the swamp, they are the swamp. They are modern day snake oil salesmen and damn good ones, maybe the best ever!
9365 2018-05-02 01:36:06 @Clinton7577 Clinton! Did you get some sleep today? Please don’t burn the midnight oil again all night tonight!
9366 2018-05-02 01:35:59 Thanks for including Venezuela. Sure helps make the case that places with really cheap gas and that have oil based economies often have real challenges.
9367 2018-05-02 01:35:57 Nothing has been done in NK yet. Tax deal is bad as it will create worst deficit in history. Investing in oil shortsighted as developed countries move away from fossil fuels. China leading way on renewable energy. Economy growing slower than Obama’s. HC projected to go way up
9368 2018-05-02 01:35:56 not all of them cost money, but I've spent way more on montpelier than the research, but my research coin is at 35k right now, and I know I have to spend another 20k + 5 cubes later. Not to mention the oil. Try to spend on the free ones if you want to save money.
9369 2018-05-02 01:35:41 Once it started raining heard sirens.,,people don’t know how to drive in the rain. The roads have a lot oil on them...very slick..SLOW Down
9370 2018-05-02 01:35:36 私はアロマコーディネーターの資格を持っていて、昨夜その会報誌が来たので読みました。Touch Careによる癒しの特集で、私も以前資格を取るためのスクリーニングで何度かアロマオイルによるTouch therapyの講習を学びに行きました。今の聖書の箇所にSpecial Oilをかけると書かれていて偶然で驚きです

9373 2018-05-02 01:34:44 As a fmr business reporter, wait until it becomes mainstream knowledge how much oil companies know about climate change. They employ a ton of earth scientists.
9374 2018-05-02 01:34:34 @realDonaldTrump Great job on the economy there Fat Nixon.  To fill my gas tank cost me more again this week.  There goes that tax break.  But I am sure your friends in oil are doing fine.
9375 2018-05-02 01:34:04 Oil pulling for the first time in a couple years.  Seriously makes me gag but the benefits are incredible! 

Anyone else ever done it??!? (15 minutes is a long time )
9376 2018-05-02 01:33:48 What’s turmeric and you put coconut oil on yo teeth?
9377 2018-05-02 01:33:17 Damn I got an oil change for free feeling rich
9378 2018-05-02 01:33:10 Heard a oil field/plant exploded but oddly its not on MSMs. My thinking. DeepState to create discontent of gas going up .blaming Trump.
9379 2018-05-02 01:33:06 That excess oil making everything extra silky >>>>
9380 2018-05-02 01:33:01 Aku pake dan bagus bgtttt, coveragenya buat harga segini udh bagys bgtttt. Dan emg oil control bgt bgt bgt, udah brapa jam juga masih stay dong gilakkk cucok

9382 2018-05-02 01:32:18 When westerners market coconut oil as best for hair, i cannot help but roll my eyes.
9383 2018-05-02 01:32:08 "Davido gave car to his girlfriend and people are shouting. Small boy things.
IBB gave oil well to Sister Folorunsho. That's the level we aspire to." ~ CollinsUma
9384 2018-05-02 01:31:47 OK, But Why...what is the oil companies "Excuse" this time?
9385 2018-05-02 01:31:34 Sebab tu le aku tak amek. Aku tak tau function dia hahaha. Sekarang yang tinggal dalam stock ascorbyl solution, plant derived squalane, moroccan oil dengan lactic acid 10%. Yang dah nak sampai ada la hyaluronic glycolic dengan lactic acid 5%
9386 2018-05-02 01:31:21 Is it an inside joke where you keep calling him a "science writer" without any scare quotes or obvious cues of sarcasm? Because @AlexBerezow is no science writer. He's a paid shill for a pharma and oil company quote science unquote PR front. Everyone knows, right?
9387 2018-05-02 01:31:17 Associating Kanye West with sense since is mother passed is like trying to mix water with oil.

Man’s been on a tail spin since his mom passed. 

Slavery was a choice... pfft
9388 2018-05-02 01:31:16 I hope Karma is around and makes him, hypothetically, drown in crude oil, you know, liquid gold.
9389 2018-05-02 01:31:15 Gabe Kapler running out of the dugout to Kingery like “Rub some coconut oil on it RUB COCONUT OIL ON IT!”
9390 2018-05-02 01:31:10 good morning girls and gays today I’m thinking to buy a tea tree oil shampoo bc these health care accs on insta say it works for your hair and will have your hair healthy

9394 2018-05-02 01:30:36 Because Oz is also a snake oil salesman.
9395 2018-05-02 01:30:22 I so enjoy dressing up my hummus. Healthy fingers of zatar, light drizzle of quality olive oil, and squeeze of fresh lemon. YOLM!!! I think I hear the ingredients calling for me to make a second serving now...

9398 2018-05-02 01:30:06 @CNN PATRICK STEWART AND I KNOW THE OTHE RONE INVOLVED WITH BILL GATES AND BIL CLINTON TO NUKE IRAN AND THEN AMERICA IS THE PLAN TO START ALL OUT WAR FOR OIL ,MURDER THE INNOCENT AND FOR INHERITANCES SET UPS AND. MURDER
9399 2018-05-02 01:29:54 SGS report: M’sian palm oil product export for April fell 4.5% to 1,331,564 MT from 1,394,973 MT shipped during March #FCPO #palmoil
9400 2018-05-02 01:29:39 MSM was fully complicit. Go back to the coverage of it. Obama was the ultimate snake oil salesmen.
9401 2018-05-02 01:29:38 If Homer Simpson was Dorothy: "Oil can. The Tin Man is rusted! Oil can. The Tin Man is rusted! Oil can. The Tin Man is rusted! Oil can. The Tin Man is rusted! Oil can. The Tin Man is rusted!"
9402 2018-05-02 01:29:37 The axis of oil sees all going to plan and laughs at us. Next up war to drive prices even higher.

9404 2018-05-02 01:29:07 Considering how the Middle East controls most of America's Oil you could be being punished for your governments bigoted stance against their people, or it could be that the black gold is finite, we need to switch to something cleaner & less likely to run out in the next 100 years
9405 2018-05-02 01:28:45   TV TIME  

Just a reminder, both events this weekend for the POWRi WAR Sprints and POWRi National Midgets will be filmed for @MAVTV and @LucasRacingTV!

Fans, the best looking sign that has Lucas Oil and POWRi on it will win a free POWRi T-shirt 
9406 2018-05-02 01:28:40 Also, skin update: no new spots today. Used an orange gel face mask and my friend gave me one with avocado oil and rice protein mask (to help with redness). When should I use it tho?
9407 2018-05-02 01:28:20 Oil changed & car washed 
9408 2018-05-02 01:28:12 Yes! You just want to get a coconut oil that’s cold pressed because heating it during the process damages the oil and it’s not as effective but even the cold pressed organic is still going to be like $10 ish per jar
9409 2018-05-02 01:28:10 Actually you may be able to use your same bong. Look on-line for a nail that will fit (if your fixtures are glass). Clean your bong thoroughly. Next you'll need concentrates (shatter, oil, wax, sauce). Just use a tiny little dab as it can be very potent. Away you go 
9410 2018-05-02 01:28:10 Substitute olive oil for SFA
9411 2018-05-02 01:27:56 OIL SIDEKECK THA HEAD OFF YA
9412 2018-05-02 01:27:55 Just spilled an entire brand new bottle of farsali oil.

9415 2018-05-02 01:27:29 Thanos, has all 6 Infinity Stones! 
Oil prices are up 
Martinez Bakery is out of bread 
9416 2018-05-02 01:27:24 I give him a few months though working in the oil field long enough will get you drinking beer
9417 2018-05-02 01:26:50 Es martes y ya les estoy diciendo a mis amigas que hay que organizar para fuel oil
9418 2018-05-02 01:26:44 If you don’t dip ur taco tortillas in oil before throwing on the comal... you not living
9419 2018-05-02 01:26:43 Bones don’t turn to oil nigga.
9420 2018-05-02 01:26:33 私と同じリアクションwww
9421 2018-05-02 01:26:27 キャスギル様やっぱドスケベよな
9422 2018-05-02 01:26:11 @seanhannity you have never ever been right about anything, the problem is you never retract any and all errors you make! You are nothing but a snake oil salesman and you and your regular viewers should be ashamed of yourselves. You will rot in hell! Get the facts right first!
9423 2018-05-02 01:25:59 Oh wait...  I forgot that Russia wanted a larger US military and a US that is producing more oil and natural gas so that we don't have to buy it from them. Use common sense please
9424 2018-05-02 01:25:31 I put a tea tree oil treatment on my hair and my entire body froze
9425 2018-05-02 01:25:26 @IanMatweew Can you please tell me the truth? Is the Earth Flat? Are their Aliens. We already know about the false flag oil grabbery stuff going on. If I die of a staged suicide, accident or medically induced heart attack pass the information along to friends on Facebook please!
9426 2018-05-02 01:25:18 @realDonaldTrump Are you raising the price of oil so your rich oil tycoons can get richer?
9427 2018-05-02 01:24:57 No oil?
9428 2018-05-02 01:24:57 @chinneolhungdim My overseas guests are not work related They are here for vacation. I  used to work in oil business and some friends still work. I've been doing consulting work. Now, I have a few ideas in my community (to empower young women and girls, like mentoring a girl).
9429 2018-05-02 01:24:56 You are snake oil.

Go away.
9430 2018-05-02 01:24:54 So what are the author's references? It's easy to find references of capitalisms brutality, i.e. African slave trade, inflicted famines that killed more than 100 million in India and China, 50-100 million Native Americans perished, WWI and WW II. Oil wars galore.
9431 2018-05-02 01:24:49 There was no cooling off period for  Tim McMillan who left cabinet for CAPP, not for failed Finance Minister Kevin Doherty, who went to Calgary consulting firm. These guys ruled on behalf of Alberta oil and business and have been rewarded well
9432 2018-05-02 01:24:47 Tea tree oil and lemon juice
9433 2018-05-02 01:24:25 There are numerous company’s selling Hemp Seed Oil as CBD     When they are advertising 3500mg of CBD in a small bottle.  They are referring to hemp seed oil.   3500 mg per 30ml is insanely high potency  and if real would costs hundreds of dollars
9434 2018-05-02 01:24:24 cbd oil isnt just for cancer or diseases like fibro , it helps with colds and the flu also sinus and tooth infections, pms , head aches, sleep problems and is ok for pets and kids
9435 2018-05-02 01:24:21 I’d like to be apart of Coconut Oil Sheen Twitter
9436 2018-05-02 01:24:18 Quantum dot is snake oil tbh.

Also, what a friggin TV nerd
9437 2018-05-02 01:24:07 Iran was in default of the agreement the day it was signed. Last administration used the “cross your fingers” with hope attitude. Plus tons of old US Gold Reserves and Cash. Yes, it was frozen from the hostage situation but was great leverage. Iran wants to sell Oil next.
9438 2018-05-02 01:24:07 oil is finite? So what? We need to reduce its use, but hurting our producers meantime whilst the middle east slaughters millions is wrong.
9439 2018-05-02 01:23:59 oil well fires are put out with dynamite
9440 2018-05-02 01:23:59 Check your frame tho. Seriously.
9441 2018-05-02 01:23:53 Random, but do you cook your eggs in butter or oil? I’ve tried doing the olive oil route (allergic to coconut oil so that’s out) but honestly eggs just taste better cooked in butter. 
9442 2018-05-02 01:23:24 This is the correct take. *Real* mayo, either homemade or what they serve in the Netherlands is phenomenal on pommes frites. I’m convinced all jarred mayo is made of rancid oil.
9443 2018-05-02 01:23:21 How to get rid of redness and oil bumps:

Keeping healthy skin is a must, it boosts your self esteem and confidence. Acne is not the only thing to concentrate on, oil bumps are very painful and redness can hurt too as well as damages your skin
9444 2018-05-02 01:23:19 What effect will happen to india if china is successful in challenging US Dollar  hegemony in oil market with its own PETRO-YUAN against PETRO-DOLLAR? @Swamy39 @bibekdebroy
9445 2018-05-02 01:22:44 i’ve been faithfully using jojoba + rosehip oil on my face and my skin has been flourishing 
9446 2018-05-02 01:22:30 hi if you’re in the performing arts business and you cut out dairy, caffeine, and sugar before a show and then add them back in, IT WILL DESTROY YOUR BODY. IT WILL ADD TO YOUR STRESS, but eucalyptus oil, prayer, and singing to footloose helps
9447 2018-05-02 01:22:29 You know what economy relies HEAVILY on oil ..... 

hold on, you can google it ..... 

figured it out yet?  

Ok, another minute ........... 

YEP ,   You guessed it , RUSSIA!  buuuuuuut, but I'm sure it's just a coincidence
9448 2018-05-02 01:21:51 Do we have enough money to sign Harper and machado cause this offense is like watching oil paint dry ?
9449 2018-05-02 01:21:26 Almost all of them u can easily just throw in the skillet and cook up w some oil and spices, but some of them actually take to sauces rly well, like cauliflower, I'll cook that shit up and throw it in Buffalo sauce in place of buffalo wings. Shit is delicious
9450 2018-05-02 01:21:25 A2: we examine the oil boom and industrialization - would love to learn about how others bring in clean energy topics #worldgeochat
9451 2018-05-02 01:21:24 RT @Mr_Lundy_x: @Dausdava @haloefekti We have the full makings for WWIII. The real makings. The oil squabble more about breaking up opposition in the middle east to the Yinon Plan and attempting to cripple Russia along the way. Afghan interest in Russian & (part 1)
9452 2018-05-02 01:21:10 See, this is the kind of BS that Mr Kenny knows will be swallowed by the daunted public. The recent spike in oil prices has NOTHING to do with the carbon tax. The real Truth: Loonie, US demand for gasoline and summer. Bottom line TRUTH
9453 2018-05-02 01:21:07 if anyone wanted to venmo me so i can pay for an oil change tomorrow i wouldn’t say no
9454 2018-05-02 01:20:48 Takde sis. Ada nanti aku kabor. Hahaha rosehip oil untuk apa?
9455 2018-05-02 01:20:39 That’s why I’m glad my wife drives an f150
9456 2018-05-02 01:20:35 I need to up my CDB oil to deal with the anxiety.
9457 2018-05-02 01:20:06 Every success started when someone had to solve a chaotic mess. Example: Whale oil lamps then Edison invented the light bulb. The President will get this done.
9458 2018-05-02 01:19:57 Samuel took the horn with the oil in it, and poured the special oil on Jesse’s youngest son in front of his brothers. The Spirit of the Lord came on David with great power from that day on. Then Samuel went back home to Ramah. 1 Samuel 16:10-13
9459 2018-05-02 01:19:56 No large oil company, media company, investment bank, airline, etc. would build out its management team without a preponderance of experience in that industry.
9460 2018-05-02 01:19:51 Another super power shames the US, the recidivist nation offered up for purchase by by a half wit president installed by a cabal of oil cartels & donor billionaires (throw in a few oligarchs & a Russian mobster).  We stupidity stood by and watched this happen. We need to fix it.
9461 2018-05-02 01:19:51 Homemade sourdough pizza crust, good olive oil, tomato sauce with tapenade mixed in, herbed mozzarella, capicola, pepperoni (turkey to keep it healthy), red bell peppers seared hard and glazed in balsamic and honey, arugula when it came out of the oven.

9464 2018-05-02 01:19:25 You and me both @DearAuntCrabby!  My anxiety is at an all-time high.  I’m scared to leave the house most days because I live in dump country, and I know they can smell my liberal scent from miles away.  I try to hide it with patchouli oil but it seems to draw more attention.
9465 2018-05-02 01:19:18 finally learned how to change the oil on my car
9466 2018-05-02 01:19:14 あん?俺を怒らせたなカチカチゴチゴチ黒焦げに揚げて欲しいのか⁈ いつものサラサラな俺じゃねえぞ
9467 2018-05-02 01:18:51 my mom started giving me cannabis oil everyday, & the first time she gave it to me i went "it tastes like weed" & she said "how do u know what weed tastes like" 
9468 2018-05-02 01:18:40 Dip some qtips in it & lavender oil and put them in a plastic baggie and then just reapply throughout the day it will deadass completely go away by the next day
9469 2018-05-02 01:18:18 and while the per-meal cost of, say, olive oil is low, if you've just run out, $10 for a new bottle is a pretty big upfront cost.
9470 2018-05-02 01:18:07 Over dosing on vitamin C always seems to make me more vulnerable to a cold.  Try 6 drops of Oil Oregano under your tongue every 4 hours for a couple of days.  Doesn't taste good but it works.
9471 2018-05-02 01:17:40 I wanna trade Kevin love for a free oil change
9472 2018-05-02 01:17:40 big e rubbing baby oil on his chest is just on a loop in my brain
9473 2018-05-02 01:17:39 Eat high fat foods to fill you up (healthy fats) - nuts, avocados, peanut butter, coconut oil, etc.
9474 2018-05-02 01:17:12 $CL_F: #Oil remains supported in 3, 7, or 11 swing pullback as far as staying above 4/7 low ($61.8) #elliottwave
9475 2018-05-02 01:17:04 さりげなく1両添える程度にV車が入ってるところがエモいですね。ぜひウチの方にもそのような変態さんが欲しいです(切実
9476 2018-05-02 01:16:58 Please don't talk about shit you obviously know nothing about.
9477 2018-05-02 01:16:57 Yes, to JBP. I can't comment as to whether all this has been thrust upon him or not. I don't know. But if he's been ostracized, and his ideas rejected, could it be because they lack merit? Maybe they see him as nothing more than a snake oil salesman, and maybe he is.
9478 2018-05-02 01:16:51 Whoops. Science catching up to the snake oil.
9479 2018-05-02 01:16:44 its been a while since i burned the midnight oil like this tbh usually when it hits 2am im unproductive as hell
9480 2018-05-02 01:16:29 Great! With superchargers one bad or missed oil change can trash the engine. I had a five speed cobalt ss supercharged :)
9481 2018-05-02 01:16:27 $CL_F #Oil shows a 5 swing sequence from 2/9 low, favoring further upside to $70.4 - $72.4 to end 7 swing WXY #elliottwave
9482 2018-05-02 01:16:26 + cost of butter/margarine/olive oil & seasonings, unless you want to serve your kids plain boiled potatoes for dinner, which ain't exactly nutritious either.
9483 2018-05-02 01:16:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and a terrorism crisis.
9484 2018-05-02 01:15:59 You know winter is officially over when coconut oil goes back to being a liquid. 
9485 2018-05-02 01:15:55 I really regret putting coconut oil on my face and my body. I feel like I’m on fire.
9486 2018-05-02 01:15:49 There’s a good chance that beard oil would catch fire 
9487 2018-05-02 01:15:49 Oil get tons of control, cap flexibility and immediate help with future 40 goal man Zadina and perennial 35 goal man Pacioretty for a lower pick a few years away from helping and a center they moved to the wing, plus one more piece. Looks good to me for Oilers.
9488 2018-05-02 01:15:38 Well my car is now leaking oil and my wheel bearings are fucked up. Looking for a boyfriend who’s a mechanic. Twitter do ur thing

9491 2018-05-02 01:15:11 Just keep trying.

And you can get all the Emeralds long before Oil Ocean, which would allow yiu to cheese that boss as Super Tails (assuming you maintain over 50 Rings the whole time).

9499 2018-05-02 01:14:00 No, I blame stagflation on bad monetary policy in response to an oil shock, same as in other countries. The polices that the shock inspire were bad in their own right
9500 2018-05-02 01:13:54 yes, death by cows or oil rigs or whatever they have there
9501 2018-05-02 01:13:45 Anyone know of a good CBD oil website? i remember  a hockey related twitter posting about one but forgot what it was.
9502 2018-05-02 01:13:45 Oil your breasts and send the damn video.

I know you know You can read this tweet. 

So please don't play with my emotions, Hell, breast is involved

9509 2018-05-02 01:12:53 Watching US news show.... Gas prices in US hitting a 3 year high ,all over the US.. So there goes the idea that carbon tax causing it here. My theory,, Big oil companies gouging everyone in both countries who buys gas..
9510 2018-05-02 01:12:51 I have a feeling jihadi castro trudeau has a plan to kill the oil and gas industry in Canada to give all the business to his islamic brotherhood in the middle east
9511 2018-05-02 01:12:37 So I learned you can make a homebrew WD-40 by mixing 9 parts vegetable oil with 1 part acetone.

It works even better than WD-40 on getting the squeaks out of my push mower.
9512 2018-05-02 01:12:23 Poor Scott Pwuitt has to set up a wegal defense fund cause all those people are so mean to him! I’m sure the coal, oil, gas, and chemical industries will find it in their hearts to contribute. Kick his sorry ass back to Oklahoma. #BootPruitt

99 each
9536 2018-05-02 01:07:57 ...and therein lies our problem. We've let US companies buy our raw lumber and raw oil without just refining it here.

I mean, what are the other markets going to say? That they all of a sudden don't want the product? Yeah, can't see that happening.

9541 2018-05-02 01:06:55 Don’t forget the millions being spent. We taxpayers are tired of the witch hunt and and the exorbitant fees being paid to these snake oil salespeople!
9542 2018-05-02 01:06:53 Several countries allow employers of specific trades to easily bring in foreigners with needed job skills.  We have several skillful Nigerians work with me at my employer because their universities offer oil and gas degrees and they have relevant work experience in Nigeria.

However, FB has brought worlds closer together, its still a business where you pay through data, you can always go to MeWe or MySpace, and even oil companies put forth a good face - Shell doesn't lead with pic of Nigera.

9579 2018-05-02 01:02:31 For these reasons, more and more people are looking toward natural remedies for treating their skin. One such natural ingredient is argan oil
9580 2018-05-02 01:02:29 Gotta get an oil change tomorrow for sure
9581 2018-05-02 01:02:25 How many partly-loaded oil tankers are sent across the pacific?

Probably the same as the number of partly-loaded container ships headed from China to YVR.
9582 2018-05-02 01:02:11 These ingredients can dry out skin and when skin is dry, the body’s oil production goes into overdrive, which clogs pores and results in acne.

Acne is a common skin condition that is often caused by excess sebum resulting in clogged pores and trapped bacteria. A common mistake is using facial cleansers, most of which contain alcohol or peroxide.
9587 2018-05-02 01:01:00 Agreed that we all need to do our part environmentally but my question is which one will help stop the importing of oil from countries with no regard for environment or human life.

9602 2018-05-02 00:59:02 Acrylics. Oil seems awesome, but I have no idea what I'm doing, so I was scared I might blow up the house with paint thinner.
9603 2018-05-02 00:58:56 it’s not coconut oil, he uses the leftover chicken finger grease from Marco’s Pizza. It’s magical.
9604 2018-05-02 00:58:54 The Russians & Iran want oil prices to shoot up & they will do it with or without Trump's intervention. Would you rather that happen with US intervention or without ?. If without then expect Saudi & other US allies to collapse & oil prices skyrocket, else stop them now.
9605 2018-05-02 00:58:29 Does one need help putting oil on

9620 2018-05-02 00:56:12 Video was from oil industry, end of video showed that. Since E15 is illegal 4 boats, it’s irrelevant. Boating industry should educate vs confuse!

9623 2018-05-02 00:56:02 El Estado nacional puso suma fija al impuesto a la transferencia de combustibles en $6,726 para naftas y en $4,148 para gas oil. El traslado al IPC de lo que acuerde Aranguren con las refinadoras no es poco si se considera que 5 puntos implican 1% de inflación.

Big Cass: give me all the baby oil you have

9646 2018-05-02 00:53:03 Correct me if I’m wrong. Was it not the Obama Admin that instituted sanctions following annexation of Crimea nixing  a $500B Exxon oil deal?
9647 2018-05-02 00:52:47 How come bread  or any other product price fixing is not allowed and Oil is?  Cut production to keep prices high?  How about  producing less of everything to control prices
9648 2018-05-02 00:52:43 But this is Australia fuck owe people and give everything to the rest of the world...could legalise marijuana which would be a trillion dollar business making everything from material stronger then steel and oil which would run your car and medical benefits...
9649 2018-05-02 00:52:29 Who did this research? My hubby was asked to stop fish oil while in hospital as it thins blood. Thinner blood equals healthier arteries.
9650 2018-05-02 00:52:23 Use castor oil! I heard it helps so I’m going to try it.  thanks girl! 
9651 2018-05-02 00:52:08 I’ve turned taking care of my nails into a nightly ritual.  I clean them, shape them, and rub a moisturizing oil on them.  It’s made it a positive and relaxing thing instead of a thing of stress.
9652 2018-05-02 00:52:02 My best friend called to tell me she remembered the time I put highlighter in my baby oil before we went to the beach and Fenty stole my idea because that shit did last us ALL DAY 
9653 2018-05-02 00:51:21 I took fish oil pills like 20 minutes ago and I already feel healthy
9654 2018-05-02 00:51:07 I’ve heard there is fake CBD oil being sold... I got some CBD for my foot pain and it didn’t work.  Did I get some fake sh&t?

Rosneft—The Crime
It is the ultimate #TrumpRussiaConspiracy 
Over a year ago, @GrantStern wrote a comprehensive article laying out how the giant Russian oil company was privatized, with Trump’s assistance, to benefit Russia, at the expense of The USA.
It is reprised here.
9677 2018-05-02 00:48:39 Earnhardt fans...
9678 2018-05-02 00:48:36 watch out for oil on the floor before you rush to get your juice. avoid costly oven repairs.
9679 2018-05-02 00:48:15 Oh, a few drops of oil went down the drain with the dishwater. Probably not a problem.

Narrator: It was the moment the disgusting fatberg had been waiting for.
9680 2018-05-02 00:48:10 Why does my face produce so much fucking oil i don’t get it 
9681 2018-05-02 00:47:59 Natural diet— roasted chicken, ground beef, ground turkey, salmon, rump roast, puréed pumpkin, coconut oil, flax seed, glucosamine. She’s almost 14 with the energy of a puppy.

9693 2018-05-02 00:46:49 Actually it happened because Trump and SoS could not get the Exon oil deal sanctions lifted off Russia. it was suppose be a multi trillion dollar deal that Exxon just pulled out of.
9694 2018-05-02 00:46:48 Nope. Just tanning oil
9695 2018-05-02 00:46:42 I just slice my sweet potatoes in half and bake face down in a glass baking dish.  No need for oil.

9727 2018-05-02 00:44:09 Ok it was baby oil. Still more than I expected lol #SDLive
9728 2018-05-02 00:44:07 There must have been a oil spill in the south end because you can smell the crude oil in the air...
9729 2018-05-02 00:44:03 even if that attention is to the detriment of others. it is the sales strategy of a snake oil salesman bathing in narcissism.
9730 2018-05-02 00:43:55 Proud to have served as marine oil spill Expert Witness with you folks on the #NorthernGateway JRP EA. Harper rigged the process in the proponent’s favour, but the conservation side ultimately prevailed.
9731 2018-05-02 00:43:55 How he used the baby oil kinda scared me,... 
9732 2018-05-02 00:43:49 I just said it's not all about spills. I know pipelines are the safest way to transport oil in liquid form. Since we can transport bitumen in solid form, this changes the argument a bit.

9787 2018-05-02 00:41:21 @chevrolet #chevylove two years with this equinox what can I say the most memorable was having it towed 130 miles home because it just decided to stop running. Also maybe the constant oil leaks, engine knocking every oil change is a new experience.

9866 2018-05-02 00:28:09 Biodiesel? Anyone want a couple of 3-5 gallon jugs of cooking oil? Only used it once but it's been sitting out for awhile.

9868 2018-05-02 00:27:58 Thank you. Why would anyone allow vehicles that burn MORE oil?

9871 2018-05-02 00:27:07 Time to tell USA we're not giving away our resources anymore . Build our own refineries and screw the pipeline. Why are Canadians paying more then Americans for our products - oil , electricity,  ng, , fair is fair.
9872 2018-05-02 00:26:36 たまたまっす笑
9873 2018-05-02 00:26:32 Also, you’re aware the oil industry received subsidies to drill and refine gas right? Yet they take in billions of profits that none of us see. How about farmers? They get subsidies. Do you hate them invalidly as well?
9874 2018-05-02 00:26:13 It's like oil for robotic limbs....
9875 2018-05-02 00:26:11 เหรอค่ะ 
9876 2018-05-02 00:25:55 Do you plan to also ban Alaskan tankers which have sailing down the BC coast to Washington state for decades or is your target only Canadian oil exports and Canadian prosperity.

9881 2018-05-02 00:25:09 Hi love, My skin type is doesn’t produce any oil and is dry & sensitive. It is also sometimes dull. I need help lol
9882 2018-05-02 00:24:55 Socialism in Bolivia is working beautifully....the key difference is they didn't inherit an economy that has been overly reliant on oil (which makes up 95% of Venezuela's exports) for most of the past century.
9883 2018-05-02 00:24:53 I’m doing stretches with lavender oil in a diffuser. I’ve given myself 9 as a reasonable bedtime 
9884 2018-05-02 00:24:48 2/3 And three (of a piece of #2), my guess is that no one was making claims about which they were willfully ignorant/lying. For example, oil execs who know that climate change is real, but claim that it is a hoax, etc., or  tobacco execs that insist smoking doesn’t cause cancer.
9885 2018-05-02 00:24:40 Today we harvested green garlic and scallions at  Front Porch Farm - sautéed in a little olive oil they are delicious!

9911 2018-05-02 00:21:46 I think it can't be called a relief from Govt but its Model Code of Conduct that is helping we people for some days else Govt is busy milking we people through Oil Marketing Companies by raising prices daily.
9912 2018-05-02 00:21:38 It could help ease your symptoms. There has been studies done stating that CBD Oil has relieved symptoms of Migraine sufferers
9913 2018-05-02 00:21:34 RT GovAyoFayose: For instance, this year’s benchmark for FG budget is $42 but oil now goes for over $70 per barrel and instead of paying all the revenues to the Federation Account, FG still operates an Excess Crude Account contrary to the judgment of the Supreme Court.

9917 2018-05-02 00:21:11 Just eyeballing this chart, it appears that the last three times this correlation broke down were 1999-2000 (before the tech bubble burst), 2005-2006 (before the housing bubble burst) and 2014-2015 (before the oil bubble burst).  Next?
9918 2018-05-02 00:21:10 I can’t handle the essential oil posts on fb lately. A mom posts about her 2 yo having febrile seizures from a spiking fever, and immediately someone says “peppermint oil brings down a fever!” If you sell essential oils, be responsible, they can’t cure everything.
9919 2018-05-02 00:21:05 I saved the last drops of my thc oil just for #InfinityWars..
9920 2018-05-02 00:21:03 See, I would have thought it was just mashed up spinach and artichoke with maybe a little olive oil and some herbs - served with some nice crudités.
9921 2018-05-02 00:21:03 The amusing part is that BC has been running on tar sands oil for decades, but the greenies have been convinced that this is all new, and the world is going to end once again.

9927 2018-05-02 00:20:25 All work, in capitalism, is "selling your body." My dad worked on oil rigs and drove truck, spending most of that time around hazardous chemicals. Now he's been fighting cancer for 4+ years. All workers deserve protection for their bodies, that's the least they're owed in trade.
9928 2018-05-02 00:20:18 I gotta check Rih prices first though she disappointed me with the price of that body oil

9941 2018-05-02 00:19:27 Okay, so let's talk about it. We as BCers have a right to protect our coast, just like you, an Albertan, have a right to protect the oil sands.

Oh, I'm sorry, did I say right? I mean a law. 

We are against the pipeline because it was fast tracked and we were lied to. #StopKM

9951 2018-05-02 00:17:49 cbd =\= thc. ppl who use medicinal marijuana (usually cbd oil) are not ‘druggies’ or ‘bums’. it’s a plant that has more pros than cons. hemp is also a widely known source for survival: you can eat it, make clothing/shelter out of it, use it for medicine, etc.
9952 2018-05-02 00:17:32 Same with the richest women in Africa. Nigeria and Angola. Oil & oil.
9953 2018-05-02 00:16:48 Bullshit.  99% of real scientists all agree that climate change is a FACT.  The only fake studies are those paid for by oil companies.  Trump is imperiling our planet, our health, and our security to enrich fossil fuel companies.  Pure GREED.

9970 2018-05-02 00:13:59 Oil revenue for our province is futile . The PC's blew 20 BILLION over 12 years in power and handed the liberals a deficit .  Poking more holes in the globe to drive us further in the hole is also futile. Oil tunnel vision has done nothing for NL

9975 2018-05-02 00:13:07 @jvide__  really just told me she put vegetable oil in her ear once cause it hurt her and now she’s scared she will die cause of it
9976 2018-05-02 00:12:56 This was just brought to my attention. If I had time, I would explain how most of the oil industry loudly cut off funding to CEI after 2006 due to CEI’s opposition to CO2 regulation and taxation and the industry’s about-face on the issue. CEI’s E&E folks remain consistent.
9977 2018-05-02 00:12:51 We have one of the biggest oil/gas deposits in the world and they want us to walk or bus to get around in this vast cold country.  How about horse and buggy. Well need to convert garages to stables. The challenge will be to have municipal govts relax the laws around farm animals
9978 2018-05-02 00:12:47 All of modern life runs on oil and natural gas.  Every time I am at the hospital I am particularly reminded that modern medicine is made possible by oil.
9979 2018-05-02 00:12:35 Cbd oil is what you want. The THC is what will make you more anxious and could interact/ or heighten anxiety

9982 2018-05-02 00:12:16 Steel and energy meaning oil is a national security concern , farm products sold to China is used for manufacturing ,some for,consumption.

9993 2018-05-02 00:10:42 True, I regrettably didn't double check for nuance. Norway started out after ww2 with a strong DemSoc movement that the right acquiesced a lot to out of fear of communist revolution. And then the power changed. Then came oil. Then again came the interest in capital. Now we suck

10002 2018-05-02 00:08:57 That's good to clean the pole from the oil on you hands and anything that may have gotten on it. The dry hands gives you a slightly better grip and for .much longer... the wife uses it all the time on our pole at home...
10003 2018-05-02 00:08:54 raw shea butter, water, and a brush. sometimes i may use coconut oil.
10004 2018-05-02 00:08:47 there will never be peace as long as the U.S. is owned by the military industrial complex and oil corporations
10005 2018-05-02 00:08:38 A lot of Michiganders here
10006 2018-05-02 00:08:15 Just got to steal one of these road games and we will be cooking with peanut oil. #Preds #BecauseItsTheCup
10007 2018-05-02 00:08:00 Pipeline projects like Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain expansion directly threaten these endangered Orcas. If the proposed pipeline expansion happens, it would lead to a 700% increase in oil tanker traffic in the Salish sea and could critically harm the Orcas. #StopKM

10010 2018-05-02 00:07:30 For instance, this year’s benchmark for FG budget is $42 but oil now goes for over $70 per barrel and instead of paying all the revenues to the Federation Account, FG still operates an Excess Crude Account contrary to the judgment of the Supreme Court.
10011 2018-05-02 00:07:23 Wish I was getting rubbed down with baby oil

10013 2018-05-02 00:06:59 Someone built those platforms, probably so the goats could escape from predators and get their daily requirement of Argan oil. Brilliant.
