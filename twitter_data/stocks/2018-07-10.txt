3 2018-07-10 23:57:01 Interesting aside, out of the 1400 stocks in our universe, they've beaten the street estimate in an average of 2.68 of the past four quarters. This time last year, average was 2.45 of past four quarters. So far, co's aren't under-delivering...

11 2018-07-10 23:53:38 I’m confused, my buddy works for amazon and he says it’s phenomenal. 

They started him at 13 an hour in the warehouse, full benefits after 90 days, he bought stocks at a discounted rate, free prime membership, and a discount when purchasing from them. Is it really that bad?

-Less popular/costly areas. (Skip nyc, san francisco. Instead head to MN or Denver)
-Real Estate
-Stocks/Bonds- even better dividends.

Do you really think we believe you, Azar, or Pfizer? You & Azar can't even keep up with the children you stole from their parents. Why should we believe you on this?
Btw, how many stocks did you and your cronies short?
Insider trading, much?

43 2018-07-10 23:41:49 Bought back stocks. Lol fuckinf trickle down economics. Don't worry it'll find it's way into our pockets
44 2018-07-10 23:40:37 Yikes. You should educate yourself before giving people advice about options or stocks in general.
45 2018-07-10 23:38:34 Stocks last? Do you mean before Brexit?
46 2018-07-10 23:36:49 Stocks must bottom before they move higher.
47 2018-07-10 23:36:43 This isn't going to go well for the economy once the effects start to kick in. Expect depression as businesses decrease inventories and capital spending, financial firms pull money out of stocks, and stock markets become even more volatile with bigger swings.

53 2018-07-10 23:32:52 Now, I'm with ya on the Insurance. Absolutely the way we can 'share' with our neighbors - even those we don't live near - in order to spread the risk and indemnify the loss.  #Capitalism is the greatest form of #Sharing we've ever devised! Insurance, Stocks called 'Shares,' etc
54 2018-07-10 23:31:53 @jimcramer Good 4 business & stocks, what about home gamers collecting from stock enhancing rulings? ie. losing future Ssecurity/pension decisions? What about future "where do the profits come from" rulings including us. win a penny lose a buck. Plse include a no huddle defense
55 2018-07-10 23:29:27 RIP Pharma/biotech stocks.
56 2018-07-10 23:27:58 I feel ya on the scanning woes.  I just finished scanning 254 frames of three different color neg stocks and had all kinds of anxiety about the best scan settings.  I know that I’m not fond of the film preset things in silverfast...I think I’m gonna just avoid them from now on.

66 2018-07-10 23:18:19 I heard  chastity belt stocks accounted for a good portion of today's gains.
67 2018-07-10 23:18:03 The best business advice I have ever heard is that Business advice is often total crap, but what I do know is that don't play the penny stocks..
68 2018-07-10 23:17:26 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.

76 2018-07-10 23:12:00 You don’t get rich fast from it unless you pour in more of your own money. It just grows faster than a savings account which only gives you 1% vs stocks which can give you way more based on how the company performs. Yes, you own a percentage based on how much you have
77 2018-07-10 23:11:21 Please explain to me why we need to have legal access to AR-15s and bump stocks? Self defense? You need a military grade weapon for self defense? You are either trigger happy or a terrible shot with a hand gun, which literally does the job just fine.
78 2018-07-10 23:10:07 Man Fox is so cool

His Uair is awesome, it does 16%, combos into itself, breaks focus attack, and can even end stocks!

That's something not a lot of characters can boast
79 2018-07-10 23:06:29 Effectively it legalises touting and ticket selling   becomes the same as stocks and shares. There will be unintended consequences on the supply side. Smaller acts will be adversely affected.

"Fair value" for #U3O8 cannot be read or set by WS.

124 2018-07-10 22:41:10 But buying that one share of Apple stock isn’t going to make you any money .. to make money off of investing into stocks you have to have at least 8 shares of it .

126 2018-07-10 22:36:59 i think lead times can be fairly long but on other stuff they tend to have orders in the pipeline to keep stocks up (and they list those). this is just, they don't have any and they won't have 'em for over a year

133 2018-07-10 22:30:37 A bit simplistic but ok. One, two or three apple stocks will not make you rich or protect you against capital loss during a correction. I get what you tryna say tho.

We’re living with the most negative audience engagement in company history, and stocks are soaring and everyone’s getting bonuses.
137 2018-07-10 22:28:45 I see, maybe someday I need to try futures or FX. Seems like stocks are more volatile though, and you can money even without a leverage.

141 2018-07-10 22:26:14 Yeah, I dumped 20 stocks of them two years ago. They got too much competition now, and now they have those dumbass puma stores connected to them
142 2018-07-10 22:26:02 And yet stocks go nowhere
143 2018-07-10 22:25:56 Good to assume remaining 116 stocks are above 10 EMA?

145 2018-07-10 22:24:47 Is there any actual data on UK food stocks?
There is a view about grocers carrying about 10 days stocks? 
It seems clear that a lot of 'stock ' is just in trucks on motorways because of JIT? 
Some clarity on UK food system resilience would be good.

149 2018-07-10 22:22:23 I'm all for the return of stocks and pillories, but that just may be my New England roots showing (although, they were legal in Delaware as recently as 1905!)
150 2018-07-10 22:22:06 I don't give advice on specific stocks or products but I will say that the private portfolios in the hundreds of millions plus began moving on this target nearly six months ago. They'll retain their accumulated wealth & be in a position to bargain hunt later. Be smart. Win.

What stocks are hot right now?
155 2018-07-10 22:18:32 You can buy Jordans, and you can buy stocks, bonds, all of that AT THE SAME TIME. These things aren’t mutually exclusive. Don’t let fake intellectuals on twitter tell you otherwise.

175 2018-07-10 22:04:07 Im not good on overall market direction so i dont bother to predict it.  I find as long as the basket is somewhat hedged with longs and shorts it positions you to catch any market move if it happens. Often though stocks with catalysts will move independently from what  seeing
176 2018-07-10 22:03:28 Easy to understand how investor might stay in “stock market” long haul, shift assets to different equities, stock selection. Hwvr, is investor now trained “indexing” is “stocks.” What happens if we get a 9+ year bear market? Like this 9+ year bull? Always seems like can’t happen.
177 2018-07-10 22:02:32 It would be nice if the scumbag that did that “fell down some stairs”. Failing that can we please bring back the stocks. Maybe having rotten fruit & veg thrown at them might educate them to acceptable behaviour.

182 2018-07-10 22:00:22 But you never know some of these penny stocks are 100% scam for sure, but some are (probably less than 5%) just trying to make it.  A lot of people trade them because they don’t have enough capital to buy 1000 shares  for $99 each to have enough volume.

186 2018-07-10 21:58:59 1/ My investment philosophy:

Skate where the puck is GOING, not where it’s been.

Where IS Puck?: Traditional assets like US Stocks, Bonds, Real Estate, CDs etc 

Where puck GOING:  

-Crypto

-Precious Metals: undervalued vs other assets 

-Cannabis: legal landscape shifting
187 2018-07-10 21:58:17 Fearful of market volatility?
Had you bought U.S. stocks (SP500) at height of volatility during the Global Financial Crisis (Nov 2008) and held until volatility fell back below its historical average nearly one year later, you'd have earned 30+% return.

191 2018-07-10 21:56:42 For me, it's "and" not "or". I do automatically invest in funds via a pretax 401k, and also automatically invest in different funds post tax, and also buy stocks in companies I believe in and think will beat the market (incl $tsla, $dis, $nke, $nvda, $amd, et al)

204 2018-07-10 21:45:29 Question: If the taxpayers are indeed keeping afloat families with food stamps, why shouldn't there be some level of say in this? It's different if someone compassionately gave another person money but this money was taken, by force, from a person with a paycheck.
205 2018-07-10 21:43:30 The stocks we own are going up faster than the average home value, making stocks the better investment at this time.
206 2018-07-10 21:43:02 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks closed higher as trade concerns ease and the S&P closed at upper resistance. CC closing higher and OLN closing higher into bullish territory. SLCA closed lower after finding upper resistance and approaching a bullish crossover.

208 2018-07-10 21:40:54 You should not penalize + earnings with - earnings unless they are fungible. Concept is similar to basket of options on stocks vs (one) option on index. Think of it as paying combined mkt cap for the +E (~27 PE) and getting -E lottery tickets for free. @paranoidbull

235 2018-07-10 21:25:31 @VikPatel84 I'd exchange ideas with Lium on stocks any day of the week. His one mistake on CTAG is a valuable lesson and still fresh in his mind no doubt. It gives him more confidence as he can share his lesson and help others steer clear of similar pitfalls. He isn't a bad guy.
236 2018-07-10 21:25:09 No dog in fight; better value in cheap stocks and some inflation protection to boot
237 2018-07-10 21:25:03 Q: How do you know when stocks are getting cheap?
A: Wall Street is called Wal-Mart Street.
238 2018-07-10 21:24:58 the Russian Fed said there was no scientific research or development work under the title Novichok…in 1992 in the Russian Fed, Soviet developmental work was stopped, and in 2017 it completed the destruction of all existing stocks of chemical weapons.
239 2018-07-10 21:24:03 I really want to invest in stocks. I wish someone would teach me.
240 2018-07-10 21:23:07 us scientists need to stick together :p i'll buy you a pound of this cheese if you're ever around Indianapolis ha
241 2018-07-10 21:22:50 In 2000s, nobody was paying attention to the prices they bought a house for because they could just flip it for more? Indexers not paying attention to price/value because stocks always go up? The parallels are fascinating, at the very least. What happens when bull market ends?
242 2018-07-10 21:22:11 Still not sure why the market is ignoring overbought market conditions -- particularly in tech and tariff policies. Six stocks account for over 100% of $QQQ gains. Small correction can drop index 10%.
243 2018-07-10 21:21:45 BOOM! Keep it up! Get that scumbag Banks into the stocks so we can all pelt him with rancid tomatoes, shipped over from the EU.

245 2018-07-10 21:20:53 I appreciate your sentiment brotherman. Couldn’t agree more. People say they don’t have money for retirement, stocks, or other investments all while that $1K spent on Jordan’s can easily be put into all the above as bricks for generational wealth.
246 2018-07-10 21:20:07 @FoxNews 10% of US households are shareholders of 84% these stocks..that's a big win for them, the companies, & their CEOs. Altho $436.6B of buybacks announced during 2nd quarter would've paid for $1,000 bonus checks to 6.8 million workers every single trading day in the quarter.

255 2018-07-10 21:13:59 Carter Page, says the FBI, was offered by Russians stocks if Ukraine sanctions were lifted. Yet the Trump admin increased sanctions against Russia and Russian individuals. And they dumped Page as soon as it surfaced he had talked to Russians. So forget that one.
256 2018-07-10 21:13:53 Not one of your options but the reason I got into crypto this year was because of the amount of money I had to invest and the risk/reward of investing it into crypto was better for my appetite than stocks. 

Maybe that falls under boring but also fuck banks.
257 2018-07-10 21:13:16 Buying stocks to make my money longer
258 2018-07-10 21:12:32 You’ve seen the rest of the trolley. I have to pick my battles.
259 2018-07-10 21:12:14 @ArmstrongTaran if you pick stocks to end up with the stock of the BB winner, shouldn't we be rating players based on their likelihood of winning at this point in time? Eg Swaggy's future looks bad right. Why are we voting on who's playing 'best'? How do we do define that?
260 2018-07-10 21:11:39 Both similar in terms of volatility and account opening. Mentioned stocks and forex as both can be traded with small amounts of money, just as crypto.

264 2018-07-10 21:07:36 Trump made tax cuts. Invest in stocks, he's making them higher! And soon everything will seem like it's costing half. Within a year you could make 5x as much.

288 2018-07-10 21:00:31 I think Canadian millenials have this attitude because they have for the most part never known a recessionary time. A short period after tech stocks crashed and the 'Great Recession' of 2009 was hardly a blip in Canada.
289 2018-07-10 21:00:23 Don’t buy stocks. Good time to wait out the inevitable recession and buy low.

293 2018-07-10 20:59:59 Normura is a ratings agency that gives stocks price targets.  They gave twitr a rating of sell and price target of $31.  It closed at 43.75 today.  There was a block of 150,000 shares bought in after hours trading.  So someone with 6 million thinks they're wrong

332 2018-07-10 20:41:12 I would go with rising interest rates, QT and the reversal of a 35 year bull run in bonds completely swamping stocks, given the much larger size of the bond market vs equities. But have no dog in this fight. Far better equity values elsewhere - esp. Asia. Good luck though !
333 2018-07-10 20:39:52 The one thing that hasn't happened in this market yet is a crazy M&A spree. That's good for 2 reasons. First every market top ends with a  crazy M&A spree so we're not at a top. Secondly M&A should be the next catalyst to take stocks higher.

336 2018-07-10 20:38:23 If you jump into a bombed out stock & its bombed out because its lead drug has failed or its drilled a duster. You will have a long wait for a recovery, if it ever does. Don't look for underperforming stocks, because they failed, look for undervalued stocks yet to perform.

348 2018-07-10 20:31:48 ما دام تتابع الأخبار السلبية عن الشركة لم يتوقف فالمخاطر عالية جدا بغض النظر عن السعر. ففي أسواق المال لا يوجد رخيص أو غالي! تنخفض المخاطر في حالة انعكاس الأخبار وتحولها إلى إيجابية فتنخفض المخاطر. مثال: هل يضمن أحد ايقاف السهم عن التداول لشهور كما هو الحاصل مع ماركة؟!

353 2018-07-10 20:29:18 @stoppedclock321 you know the investment app I was talking about the other day? Turns out it's more of a glorified savings account basically. Not really worth it if you actively want to invest in stocks
354 2018-07-10 20:28:27 And yes nothing goes anywhere without some exposure or a pump but if I’m going long I like things to be much more organic then this mess.... but I only go long on pot stocks 
355 2018-07-10 20:28:09 Quantitative easing (aka deliberate inflation of stocks and shares) is the biggest financial scam ever perpetrated by Western govts against their own people, rivalled only in UK by longterm house price inflation policy. Benefits only the already haves.
356 2018-07-10 20:26:56 Has anyone else decided to increase bond exposure these days instead of buying stocks, or am I swimming against the current?
357 2018-07-10 20:26:33 Hoy! Same. Nasa shares of stocks pa lang ako.

364 2018-07-10 20:21:55 I’m talking bout to buy $190 not for stocks in general. Being that they are so high you gonna need to buy in bulk and huge bulk to make a profit but investing that $220 or $190 in to smaller ones is the best options
365 2018-07-10 20:21:50 I need somebody to explain these stocks to me

368 2018-07-10 20:21:01 Thanks!  @BagholderQuotes 

any of those ones run by people with shady background?  Preferably with either a bankruptcy, fraud charges, or some sort of past embezzlement?

378 2018-07-10 20:16:18 That would mean dummies. Dummies do now short stocks in volume or at all. Also, the UEC Presentation on the web site notes $12.2 mil in cash as of a few weeks ago that takes quite a while to go through. The longest that I have seen UEC options go out is 9 months.  I see no LEAPs.

461 2018-07-10 19:36:29 In large cap stocks, inherent patterns become easy to spot as u gain sensitivity to fluctuations w/in the movements.  It's pure cause/effect:  specific stimulus must trigger a specific reaction.  It's what we lack in awareness tho that induces faulty perceptions & hence mistakes.

531 2018-07-10 18:58:30 Research costs were about 1% at both of them.  Trading costs were under 10 bps in the last decade as most stocks trade in pennies and are liquid. Micro-cap, bond, and other less liquid asset classes would have higher trading friction costs I'm sure. We were U.S. equities.
532 2018-07-10 18:57:51 $AVOI pop up on my screen  0.0110 That was a great move! Will find the next one again 
533 2018-07-10 18:56:23 I read this as a $100k household would put their paycheck savings into stocks until they've found a house. So yeah it came from their paychecks ultimately, but the first option makes it seem like you took it out of a savings account.

537 2018-07-10 18:54:57 Their stocks could still go up. They don't need the stores. All they need is investors.
538 2018-07-10 18:54:22 Lol, I saw it on alert but didn't get filled at .025. Didn't want to risk chasing above that and get caught, so of course $AVOI just hit .08.

Well it is now clear that a floor has been set at .18. The problem is now that the stocks have just about rotated once or almost twice, and the buyers are in at the .16 to .18 and some even at .20 cent mark.

No one is just going to sell at their purchase price.....>
554 2018-07-10 18:47:41 I'd add more, try to hit 10 stocks first before you add to existing stocks. That's my personal opinion.

659 2018-07-10 17:57:26 Oh dear! A million AR-15’s is at least 999,999 too many IMHO. That said, long guns are allowed sans registration everywhere: a sawed off shotgun can do much damage. The difference is the ammo & bump stocks of course. You cannot take out as many kids with a shotgun & fewer die.

671 2018-07-10 17:52:10 It seems people have no idea how investing in stocks work. The more shares you buy in a stock the more profit you’ll make. You won’t make the kind of profit buying one stock as you can when you buy a pair of sneakers and reselling them. It’s not so simple.
672 2018-07-10 17:51:44 I’ve been told that earnings are sky high and they will drive profitability for corporations, so stocks can only go up.
673 2018-07-10 17:50:55 I'm tired of giving energy to companies with stocks whichbproduce products which serve to enrich some at the detriment of many. They likely won't be big players in the future anyway, as they move too slow anyway, on their gilded high horses above. #goodbye #atandt #facebook

796 2018-07-10 17:08:53 Why does billionaire Warren Buffett pay less income tax than his secretary?
Long-term capital gains, which derive from the sale of investments such as stocks and bonds held more than a year, are taxed at 15 percent. That’s below the 35 percent maximum tax rate on ordinary income

798 2018-07-10 17:07:48 Why would anyone introduce a breed of foreign non-commercial fish into our waters that could jeopardize our fish stocks ? If DFO wants to experiment with a new species and cannot predict the future outcome , introduce it to a place that is completely separated from the mainland.
799 2018-07-10 17:07:26 Basically that tweet is stupid because if you spend 190$ on a single share, it’s going to take a log add time for you to double that investment. In order for you to double up your money on 1 share the value of those stocks would have to increase by 100%.
800 2018-07-10 17:07:00 What is the point of talking about what the "market" is seeing in the current economic environment, when three stocks are responsible for 70% of this year's gain in the S&P 500. $MSFT $AMZN $NFLX

809 2018-07-10 17:05:22 Mid-Day: Stocks are still trading in positive territory.  MBS has slipped down 6bps and Yields have risen slightly to 2.87%.
810 2018-07-10 17:05:21 You buy into the stock at 190.00$ for example. You now have 1 share of Apple valued at 190$ if the value of that stock goes up 1% the total value of your stock is now 192.90$. Congrats you made almost 2 dollars. To make money on stocks, you have to invest in more than 1 share.

914 2018-07-10 16:25:45 Thank you!
915 2018-07-10 16:24:14 Never a good idea to borrow and the use proceeds to buy stocks, ever. Fools errand.

917 2018-07-10 16:23:27 Continue to anticipate new highs in the markets lead by growth stocks.  Favorites include FB, GS, BABA,JPM, and C.
918 2018-07-10 16:23:27 I'm really curious: When the smart people divest, who is buying? Who believes fossil stocks are worth buying?

920 2018-07-10 16:23:06 Very good, but you know milk isn’t fruit and vegetables, right?
921 2018-07-10 16:22:59 Yeah because the children of billionaires really worked hard for all that money they can do whatever they want with. And it's not like they can buy stocks in a thousand different predator multi nationals and grow that wealth without risk. God holy shit dude fuckin THINK.
922 2018-07-10 16:22:16 Is today the peak of wave 2 in stocks, to be followed by new lows for 2018?

924 2018-07-10 16:21:32 @HalftimeReport So if S&P rise 3 stocks, THEN so many Stocks undervalued such as $CC where PE 6.88 and PEG 5, you need to do a segment titled THE UNDERVALUES

932 2018-07-10 16:19:18 Good one! I suppose I might think that, but realize that the stock market is not NECESSARILY a reliable predictor of the economy. 

The top 1% is happy (CEOs who engage in massive stock buy backs to artificially inflate the value of their stocks, and their own pay as a result)
933 2018-07-10 16:18:00 It was possible for you, @Caroline_Stocks, to have typed “teenager [who's] been allowed” instead. ‘Whose’ is possessive; ‘who's’ means ‘who has’.

949 2018-07-10 16:11:22 Someone who doesn’t have the proper finances will be retired before they get their ROI. It’s better to invest in penny stocks, smart investing in them could result in much larger returns
950 2018-07-10 16:10:41 Understanding that drawdowns are a fact of life in the stock market is helpful for setting realistic expectations as an investor but statistics don’t matter when stocks are falling. @porinju PMS is also a part of that .

973 2018-07-10 16:01:51 RT TheBullBull "Stocks_Learner Nigel__DSouza That's why Suzuki and Honda should come up with the idea of a car catheter first..."
974 2018-07-10 16:01:40 Because of the potential gain you don't need a large size for these type of stocks.. They can move 4 or 5% pretty quickly .
975 2018-07-10 16:01:35 I didn't hear any of the past president's complaining when the companies they owned stocks in  sold out and sent their production to countries like Mexico because they were willing to work for a wage that was deplorable to U.S
 Citizens?!?  We're you even alive in those days???
976 2018-07-10 16:01:28 Also I may add through February of this year Trumps stock market was up 25% which is fantastic.  In the same period of Obama’s tenure, stocks also rose 25%.  I know republicans say Obama did nothing right, but it’s hard to see that if you look at the raw numbers.

1004 2018-07-10 15:56:20 No it does not change in one day.   Yet,  if stocks fall ( and I think they will, eventually)  the debt stays.  This is the number one , imo, focus of the central banks.  Support the massive amounts of debt.   So,we have massive central bank intervention vs reality.

1042 2018-07-10 15:40:18 I am not.  If prod increases +1.5mbd and neither crude imports nor crude exports nor refining change, stocks will rise.  If imports and exports increase by the exact same amount and refining stays same, stocks will rise if field prod has risen.

1055 2018-07-10 15:37:00 Trivia Tuesday: A- Stockholders are owners while bondholders are creditors. In very simple terms, stocks (or shares) are units of ownership in a company whereas bonds are "investment IOUs" that the issuers agree to repay.

Other than simply as a statement of fact (and as part of that, identifying whether CETV is reduced accordingly), it's dangerous to make any further  implications/suggestions.

1272 2018-07-10 14:15:42 This is just basic psychology. I’ve told people before that this one of the flaws. People are more likely to hold “expensive” currencies. It’s the same for stocks. There are optimal ranges, that people feel comfortable with because they are used to it.
1273 2018-07-10 14:15:30 Both are fine tbh. But, you need to invest in several 10s (if not hundreds) shares of stocks to really see something. Many people don’t have the initial capital to front it

1438 2018-07-10 13:10:27 Domestic benchmark equities ended higher today, extending gains for the third straight session and posting their highest close in more than five months. The gains were led by IT, realty and capital goods stocks, ahead of key quarterly results.

1441 2018-07-10 13:09:39 Not knowing how to pick stocks -- yes that's a financial mistake.

Acquiescing to peer pressure or the beta bux bidding war -- symptoms of a larger issue, of which "financial" was merely one of many manifestations.

1450 2018-07-10 13:06:26 Not with all bishops. Asking the poor to pay tithing instead of feeding their children is un-Christlike especially when the church has over $70,000,000,000 in assets of which over $32,000,000,000 are in stocks and bonds. Our church leadership are in apostasy
1451 2018-07-10 13:04:51 @kingIrg_   I see the valid point you are raising. But also remember stocks can be confusing for a majority of ppl.  People need to be introduced to getting a PORTFOLIO managed by someone like Fidelity. Which I flip sneakers and put a percentage of profit into Fidelity. #invest

1456 2018-07-10 13:01:06 Physical gold should be owned as a hedge. It shouldn't represent a large part of your overall portfolio. Gold exploration/production stocks are asset-yielding (hopefully) and make for better "investments." But still, diversification is key.

1546 2018-07-10 12:16:14 message boards for stocks are a haven for people trying to drive the price down so they can load up.  or to drive the price down to cover short positions.  or drive the price up to sell out.

1557 2018-07-10 12:10:25 That has been reported. The upward trajectory has continued through for the last 9 years now after the disaster Bush left. CNN International has Richard Quest on everyday reporting on stocks, shares, job numbers, impending trade wars etc

1559 2018-07-10 12:08:37 Regret is selling the stocks of EasyCall PH when it was barely halfway in its appreciation and could have earned a huge amount of profits. Ah, Fin Ec days.

1563 2018-07-10 12:07:05 I'd agree if he wasn't talking about just a single stock. Stocks move way too slow even in multiples compared to crypto projects. Lol
1564 2018-07-10 12:06:30 Exactly.. Most of them don't offer services for non US residents..and the ones that do, don't have instruments such as Penny Stocks
1565 2018-07-10 12:05:39 I find it so funny how people with "good education" (like Engineers, accountants, etc) seems to know know investing or trading very well. Isaac Newton, a genius known for calculus, lost bigtime in stocks because of his ego. I hope no genius will follow his stock market fate.
1566 2018-07-10 12:03:48 Let me know of any stocks you want to know if they are Bullish ... if they are ... they will appear as Gh....Gh Stocks!

1568 2018-07-10 12:03:23 There’s only two asx listed Cobalt stocks I’m currently interested in. $NZC and $CLA. The Aussie ones need enormous capex to get started. $NZC can get going for $55m.

1572 2018-07-10 12:00:16 I do my research first. And watch the stocks I’m interested in. I usually follow the MACD. I buy when it signals. I like to have more control, as well as limit the fees.  So I save and purchase a good amount of shares at once.
1573 2018-07-10 12:00:16 No it isn’t.  what he saying is investing money ain’t hard it’s just something we not doing lolthey money u spend on random shit can be used for stocks. That’s it

1576 2018-07-10 11:56:30 The poll results make it seem like it's an obvious landslide victory, but while I do agree that Socal has the stronger lineup, it would actually be a pretty tight battle. There's always the chance that Lucky or SFAT just get deleted, but also Mango might just take 10 stocks.

Did you know that stock in HCA, the nation’s largest hospital & physician practice company, was $31 and is now $105. Same for other healthcare stocks while premiums & costs rise.
1579 2018-07-10 11:55:10 You can't say that alok jain sir. I don't see any downs in your portfolio. 2-3% ...down is nothing.. that too in such big correction where stocks falling 50-80% and index on a whole has gone down .. can't imagine your portfolio returns when market will pickup..

1585 2018-07-10 11:52:18 There seems to be a disconnect between the coaching and communication. Whenever a new youth signing is made it's Murray or Humphreys we hear from, as if Rennie has no hand in who we are signing from our youth stocks. Leadership at the club was certainly clearer in the Toonie era.

1590 2018-07-10 11:45:20 i know what it was about. but you portrayed investing in stocks as if it were "better" than buying jordans.

its okay to suggest doing one thing without putting down another.

1600 2018-07-10 11:33:41 Sure well basically you purchase the stock depending on if the companies stock rises then you profit.  I try to research the stocks to see what moves they are making to see how it will affect the stock.
1601 2018-07-10 11:33:08 Part of the mind control....Stocks are high stakes gambling.  Getting “rich” off of stocks takes at least a $10,000 bet to start.  Better to invest in a skill or a talent you can profit from for life
1602 2018-07-10 11:31:13 Funny thing i see most online trading personalities were penny stock traders who only made money affliate marketing now are too good to trade penny stocks. GTFOH you're CFD broker won't let you trade penny stocks because you  are on 20X margin leverage. 400% = 400% you smdh

1611 2018-07-10 11:24:55 Sure well basically you purchase the stock depending on if the companies stock rises then you profit.  Like amd rose about 0.25 today so times that by 3 shares I have that's 0.75 profit. I try to research the stocks to see what moves they are making to see how it will affect it

1621 2018-07-10 11:20:30 You better print more money. Dax only up the last six days in a row, and houseprices increasing at fastest pace in the last 11 years. More money to help houseprices and stocks needed. And punish those with money in the bank severely.

1623 2018-07-10 11:20:08 Can you explain to me how stocks work. I don’t understand.
1624 2018-07-10 11:19:45 Hypothetically I’d go to cash and govt bonds. If there is a recession bond yields would fall (not only due to demand but central bank action). Then I’d use the cash to buy back into stocks. 
But yield curve not yet inverted, so I’m still in equities.
1625 2018-07-10 11:19:09 You better print more money. Dax only up the last six days in a row, and houseprices increasing at fastest pace in the last 11 years. More money to help houseprices and stocks needed. And punish those with money in the bank severely.
1626 2018-07-10 11:18:38 Yes being bear is all about deep pockets & holding your nerve. Once I did a study & I largely follow it that no matter at what point you short, you’d make money if you have your own money to pay margin & MTM. Effective use of options makes shorting even more attractive

1630 2018-07-10 11:13:58 My point is about training the logistics arm.. Sure, our "Big Wars" have had 6, 9, 10 mth build-ups. But if that is what we always assume, then that is a strategic weakness. And, no, I don't regard what we have in Estonia as anything more than completely token equipment stocks.

1679 2018-07-10 10:39:28 People who think a stock cant go from 150 to 5000 in 3-5 years are probably ignorant and just follow nifty. There are literally 100s of stocks which have done that. And we are going to see the biggest bull trend of all time in the next years. It is just going to get stronger.
1680 2018-07-10 10:39:06 The prospects of IT sector look good over the next 1-2 years. Recovery in BFSI segment could be healthy. Investment can be made in stocks like TCS, Infosys & HCL Tech for healthy long term gains.

1683 2018-07-10 10:36:18 I think short over hype stocks is a real risky game to play... they can remain over hyped longer than your account margin may last

1764 2018-07-10 09:17:34 But he attained his wealth with high cap or mega cap value stocks with steady growth. Investing is investing, gambling is gambling. 90% of "investors" lose all their money and give it to 10% because they are gambling in the market.
1765 2018-07-10 09:15:54 Sure it’s hard and the market could rally for another year or 2 or 3 but to be putting (a large %) of money into stocks now with global stock markets as artificially inflated as they are is risky.
1766 2018-07-10 09:15:23 I bet you achieve better or at least as good Returns has people who frantically jump around Stocks as well. The key really is careful and considered selection of which Stocks you buy and making sure they fit well in your Team.
1767 2018-07-10 09:14:18 Historically that's exactly who provides the greatest returns. Many companies with this "rapid growth" end up with a negative EPS thus not allowing them to even reinvest in themselves, which in turn drops market value. Warren Buffett got rich with not micro cap growth stocks

1928 2018-07-10 06:53:33 There is absolutely no doubt in that...only thing is that an investor need to be more diligent, and do enough research before picking up stocks! (Compared to other investment options)
1929 2018-07-10 06:53:21 I find the app great on notifications, but still prefer reading in investigate, which does then result in a need to maintain two lists of stocks I am interested in!
1930 2018-07-10 06:52:12 Yes I did and I definitely will look into that once I get out the Army and have more free time on my hands. If you find out any information about stocks though I would definitely wanna hear it
1931 2018-07-10 06:51:56 I mean. His thought was in the right direction. He does have a point in that we don’t think about investing in stocks, generally. 
It really is something we don’t teach each other about, most time.
1932 2018-07-10 06:50:32 You just started a clothing business right? So invest in yourself by possibly taking an online marketing class. So you can learn more about how you can better market your clothes etc that would be an investment. And would help you make more money. But stocks is on the list

1934 2018-07-10 06:49:03 Downtown #Nairobi a major hub of counterfeit goods, is experiencing a serious crunch as the effects on the anti-Counterfeit war begin to bite. Those that have these stocks, have inflated the price,as hoarding also takes place in the "belief" that the onslaught will dissipate.
1935 2018-07-10 06:48:46 Index stocks are 100% the way to go for the casual investor. My favorites are $VGT and $VUG

1938 2018-07-10 06:47:17 Stock brokers don't care about anything... 
They just care about customers buying stocks from them. Whatever it takes...
1939 2018-07-10 06:44:08 But isn't MSCI having a select few stocks and here we are talking about whole gamut of stocks to deal with. Won't it lead to unnecessary volatility which is bad for small investors?
1940 2018-07-10 06:43:42 @GNSensay It looks like the $cve is outperforming all other oil stocks; looking to break through that 14 resistance heading 20. I had switched out my position to $vet with it's appealing high yields. what is your opinion on $cve these days when you see their price just surging.

1942 2018-07-10 06:42:33 I personally haven’t gotten into investing in stocks yet but I’m open to learning more about it. When I say “invest” sometime I just mean anything that will help you grow, which can help you make more money. So for example I have a hair business. Me investing in myself/business

1947 2018-07-10 06:37:41 Your first investment will always be the scariest, jusko pano pa kaya kung nag stocks pa ko!
1948 2018-07-10 06:36:33 I get your point but we as collectors or resellers can still make a decent profit down the line if you pick the right shoes. They can rise in price overnight such as stocks. Many people like myself have a 401k that is already involved with the stock market. My shoes are making $$

1954 2018-07-10 06:25:31 I’m interested in buying some stocks Which companies do you think are good buys ?
1955 2018-07-10 06:23:47 Rut, Nasdaq approaching double top or new high . DJTA,DJIA had strong rallies on 7-9-18. DJUA was punished for over 3%. Precious metals steady. 30 yr was 2.96; 10yr, 2.86. Inversion anybody? Are stocks standing or moving around the precipice? Will probably not have to wait long.
1956 2018-07-10 06:23:04 NVDA, TCEHY, AMZN, MSFT, BIDU, MU, AAPL, GOOGL, INTC. Wishing 1 day these stocks fall 50%, so I can get in. I'll keep dreaming.
1957 2018-07-10 06:22:53 i was told there were no more slacks but im literally so small that they had stocks in my size lm a o

1967 2018-07-10 06:14:54 Happy to buy at this moment. Micro indicators like IIP, auto sales, capex are all showing good progress. Suspect quarter numbers down the line to be good also. Just need to be careful about inferior governance stocks
1968 2018-07-10 06:14:32 Buying stocks can lose you money tho :/
1969 2018-07-10 06:13:52 Self Note:

Market indexes are above fair value with little meaningful positive returns over next 5 years.  To protect my portfolio, I will need shares that can at least double their profits just to simply hold present value.

Growth stocks should outperform undervalued stocks.
1970 2018-07-10 06:12:43 Their stocks should have gone up for doing the right thing @Twitter

1973 2018-07-10 06:11:52 If you want to tell me that #Stocks and #Crypto market has equal accumulation cycle you are just wrong. #Nasdaq and #cryptocurrency exchanges are not the same. Why?

1976 2018-07-10 06:09:37 Someone teach me about stocks.
1977 2018-07-10 06:09:25 Not sure what you mean, but just know that most people actually don’t hold these contracts/calls until the expiration date (Jan 2020 in this case). You just buy/sell these contracts just like stocks. I could have held the call, but each day introduces more risk.
1978 2018-07-10 06:08:46 Mkt not as efficient as stocks as not all investors - price gains often not until completion? E.g Lilyfield light rail extension
1979 2018-07-10 06:08:29 Boys collect sneakers, men collect watches and smart men collect stocks. I’m in definitely in some awkward in-between phase where I’ll probably end up with a room full of pogs and coins

2013 2018-07-10 05:42:26 I hate that mentality that buying stocks are some kind of Holy Grail that will make us all wealthy. It doesn't work like that. No matter how many stocks I buy, the system is still not made for us. Let's focus on that and not making other people feel bad for wanting shoes

a) Stocks are 4 gamblers. Real estate is "Real"
b) T+1 liquidity in stocks.

d) emotional factor. Fear and greed
e) lack of education. People still follow "dada par-dadas ' concept & see stock market and real estate accordingly

2088 2018-07-10 04:35:08 Its a great way to invest in stocks for beginners. Whatever is in your balance, it will put percentages into each stock automatically. Ex: If you have 50$ in the app, it’ll put 2$ in Apple, 2$ in Amazon, etc. and the more money you have in the app, the more it’ll invest.
2089 2018-07-10 04:33:17 an unrelated question. Where can I get historical IV data for stocks ? Your website has that, but can it be downloaded in excel ? any other free or paid source would also suffice. I am looking for IV data in daily OHLC or atleast O-C format

2097 2018-07-10 04:28:42 Just letting u know I watched stock prices for years but in terms of investing I used to only put my money in Unit Trusts. Your tweets + stock talks from a bredren got me buying stocks directly. As I tweet this I just opened an envelope to find my Carreras dividend cheque.

2113 2018-07-10 04:16:28 Avocado toast bullshit. I mean, if you know to invest in massively profitable stocks only, then yes, do that because you're a fucking wizard. But if you can't see the future, your ROI on an index fund would be like 15 bucks for a several thousand dollar buy-in. Buy the shoes.
2114 2018-07-10 04:15:10 Scared money don't make money, I don't think stocks are for people that are scared to lose money  people need to know the struggles of it. "Safe" don't make money
2115 2018-07-10 04:14:01 Store-of-value by diff. retain purchasing power into the future, like property, commodity (Gold), stocks of non-cyclical industries (Utilities) for value investors

2156 2018-07-10 03:45:25 The tax cuts are going to give me a bit more $ at least now. I don’t think it will hurt stocks much, mostly help. Tariffs on the other hand... I don’t think it’s gonna pan out as well as trump thinks
2157 2018-07-10 03:43:35 (1 of 2) Good points here. Marin won’t talk individual stocks with people on Twitter, he typically only responds to questions like that if you’re a subscriber to his paid research. Although the sector is poised to move higher, many bulls have been preaching this song since 2015.
2158 2018-07-10 03:43:34 Dividend reinvestments are ok. Or monthly deposits to an IRA. I use sites like @FutureAdvisor for ideas, but I still fare better with my own projected returns and they don't recommend individual stocks in favor of ETFs for fees and diversification
2159 2018-07-10 03:43:24 Other than blackjack, my stocks, and my fifa career everything fucking sucks right now

2164 2018-07-10 03:39:35 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
2165 2018-07-10 03:38:29 Marin, I am a nobody but this is driving me NUTS!  UEC based on 151.54M shs has 17.15M short shares which is 11.32% of the float. OMG! And it consistently grows.  Please comment on why this is especially when other stocks like URG, UUUU or DNN are but 2.00 to 3.25% short. Thank U
2166 2018-07-10 03:37:32 How do you sweat assets locked up as long term investments in listed stocks ? I can only think of selling calls & stock lending. Both however come with a risk of losing chunky stock gains unless deep out of money calls are sold. Is there any other way of sweating these assets?
2167 2018-07-10 03:37:01 Public shaming in US is a time honored Puritanical method of controlling those who offended strict social rules or ruined community peace. Conway-Miller-Sanders-Mnuchin-Zinke...Trumps gang are lucky we don't still throw turds at criminals in stocks!

2179 2018-07-10 03:29:48 $UXIN just IPOed at a bad time. It happened right at peak tariff uncertainty and pretty much the exact moment when the entire market dipped, especially Chinese stocks. Other than timing, I couldn't find anything else. If you have another questions lemme know, I've done lots of DD

2187 2018-07-10 03:25:13 “Fleecing insurance companies?” Who invested in said insurance company stocks immediately upon the ACA passage which was passed on partisan votes? Democrat politicians. Hence, the importance of the “risk corridor” payments to guarantee insurance co. solvency & their hearty ROI.

2193 2018-07-10 03:21:31  I’m sure you know about stocks then but I’ve seen this raggedy argument too many times in the past two weeks on the TL w people acting like this actually makes sense.
2194 2018-07-10 03:20:44 Clasra you are just trying be funny and cheap.Those Generals went home disgraced and without benefits for wrong decision in investing NLC money in Stocks. They did not take that money home. Kiani's brothers are not his concern.
2195 2018-07-10 03:20:25 y’all buying small pieces of big stocks that ain’t gone make you but $20 in 6 months when you could be investing in a small business that you see coming up and actually see a real profit
2196 2018-07-10 03:20:05 Investing in stocks is good if u know what ur doing but you don't need to shame and discourage black people for our affinity for kicks to push the idea of investing, especially if you're going to leave out how lucrative the resell shoe game is.

2205 2018-07-10 03:15:04 If you look at apple stocks for the year, it didn’t even do that well. You better off investing in your damn and buying whatever the hell you want.

2208 2018-07-10 03:13:29 Stocks go up and down too. The effort to obtain fair and balanced international trade is going to cause some fluctuations. It will level out and be perfectly fair once fair trade is accomplished!
2209 2018-07-10 03:12:42 That's true but the post is saying that black ppl should invest in stocks, not materialistic stuff.
2210 2018-07-10 03:12:08 How well do you know, penny stocks?
2211 2018-07-10 03:11:48 What is the definition of micro, small and Midcap stocks as per you.....
2212 2018-07-10 03:11:24 That's the prob. You have to camp out forever. There are a lot of guys who think one is around the corner. I don't know what to do. I mean, they are cheap enough where you probably can't get hurt too bad. I feel that way kinda about gold/silver stocks. But how long to wait?
2213 2018-07-10 03:11:02 All of Buffett stocks will be up in 100 years
2214 2018-07-10 03:10:40 Hi Gopal,
@jvembuna talks about investing in S&P500 which is a basket of 500 stocks. The index in India is not broad. And many good MFs have beaten index even with high TER.

Going forward, we can expect a cut in TER.
2215 2018-07-10 03:10:06 Stocks will not go up if Trump does this
2216 2018-07-10 03:09:57 I only discovered your blog recently because of a retweet and I'm currently getting ready to purchase stocks so please keep tweeting 
2217 2018-07-10 03:09:40 @Tawcan what would you recommend to do with some extra cash. Buy new dividend stocks or purchase more of the ones I currently own

2219 2018-07-10 03:08:32 Gotten in many arguments recently with my Dad about Uranium. He says you'll sit around all your life waiting for a Uranium rally. He says he's only seen one in his lifetime and that was the one you were referring to. All those U stocks are sooooo attractive at these cheap prices.
2220 2018-07-10 03:08:28 My favorite from that list is How To Make Money in Stocks

Trend Following can be summarize in a 10 page chapter and is just a complement to Turtletrader

You are missing "Trading in the Zone" and "Reminiscences of a stock operator"

Nice Book selection!
2221 2018-07-10 03:08:13 Just a lil educational PSA: ESAs are not protected under the ADA, they are protected under the FHA & ACAA. They don’t have public access rights like SAs do bc they don’t task. They shouldn’t be in public places such as businesses, you’re putting the public & service teams at risk
2222 2018-07-10 03:06:11 Correct. Stance.

Flax in Oakland has a good selection. I think Therapy on Valencia stocks them too.
2223 2018-07-10 03:05:54 Getting ONE share from a company is a huge win/loss. Stocks are unpredictable but buying one stock can earn u thousands in one day
2224 2018-07-10 03:05:36 How are you sure There was stocks ?
2225 2018-07-10 03:05:28 this event generates awareness, allows people who don’t normally think about these things to make an impact, tanks stocks for a day, generates news and social media buzz to highlight an issue otherwise unreported… there’s a lot of good things this sort of organization can do.
2226 2018-07-10 03:05:23 No I don't know about stocks,  shares, what roi is I'm just tweeting.
2227 2018-07-10 03:03:40 Actually made a whole thread with many stocks that are cheaper,  the thread was about investing but go off.
2228 2018-07-10 03:03:25 Similar to that loss at Rutgers while you were at UW.  Just 1 game and move on.
2229 2018-07-10 03:02:41 Again mention,,if Tariffs where eliminated between China and USA, expect strong rally in Chinese stocks.
2230 2018-07-10 03:02:22 It is.  The whole thread is about investing over buying material things.  If you truly interested there are actual stocks I purchase in the thread,  much cheaper options.
2231 2018-07-10 03:02:01 I mean stocks typically increase in value while most Jordan’s decrease in value. Either way people should do what they want with their money. I buy sneaks or stock depending on my mood. 
2232 2018-07-10 03:01:39 As of 11:00 a.m., PSEi 7,199.75 up 13.13 points or 0.18 percent. #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
2233 2018-07-10 03:01:17 As opposed to sneakers, there are multiple level stocks low risk/ high risk.. low cap, mid etc. I would say you definitely have a greater chance yielding decent returns investing in the s&p or an etf in a booming industry vs a sneaker that depends on a much smaller buyer’s market
2234 2018-07-10 03:01:07 Anti Blackness is easier than saying you don’t know shit about stocks...
2235 2018-07-10 03:00:48 The current admin is anti-environment, anti-NATO, anti-International alliances except for Russia, pro-life, anti any reasonable gun control like SARs and bump stocks. And Trump’s behavior is like a less-successful Hugh Hefner. 1953
2236 2018-07-10 03:00:03 Sell-signal detected for 13 stocks: $SYK $GRMN $SYMC $JBLU $NBL $MRO $RIG $COP $LUV $UNM $SBUX $LM $DLPH
2237 2018-07-10 03:00:03 Buy-signal detected for 9 stocks: $RHT $EMN $INTC $BLK $BBT $MPC $FDX $NDAQ $MET
2238 2018-07-10 02:55:00 Also, buying into stocks is good, but it’s def not the reason why black folks are in bondage
2239 2018-07-10 02:53:44 You right, but how many stocks can you actually invests in and get a great yield in return?
2240 2018-07-10 02:53:10 I invested in stocks for the first time last week. At the end of close today I’m up $0.30. Things are looking good... real good 
2241 2018-07-10 02:52:57 But this will just push the price of first 250 stocks high right? As most of the funds will  flows in to this basket.
2242 2018-07-10 02:52:42 I never said I was a stock broker nor did I say go purchase apple stocks my tweet was about investing,  so was my thread which I'm sure u didn't go over but go off.
2243 2018-07-10 02:52:37 How did you get a borrow? I often find unborrowable stocks give great but entirely theoretical short entries.
2244 2018-07-10 02:51:32 my dad is currently lecturing his friends about stocks i mean i luv how he is so passionate about it but y u gotta screaM DAD!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHA 
2245 2018-07-10 02:50:29 Environmentally, state-subsidies create continued & increased pressure on depleted fish stocks. Reducing/removing subsidies is difficult, as the wretched political reality is an entitlement perception by an invested constituency (Jones, 2010; Gianni, et al., 2016).
2246 2018-07-10 02:49:51 Yesterday market went up with very low volumes and to me this is not sustainable. Low volume is applicable for Nifty as well as individual stocks
2247 2018-07-10 02:48:12 There are stocks in the thread that do.  The thread was about investing not apple itself but ok.
2248 2018-07-10 02:46:19 People still not understanding that the shoe market is at least as volatile and moneymaking as stocks in 2018

2250 2018-07-10 02:44:28 When you have spent your life taking all you could from anyone who has any dealings with you, are you really the person to point out the hypocrisy? Did you not buy stocks in these companies when you should have? Should've gotten some advice from your grifty bro, Wilbur Ross.

2254 2018-07-10 02:41:05 So how much money do you have invested in infant formula industry stocks ??
2255 2018-07-10 02:39:31 Sir the big problem I suppose is that a large chunk of Indian MF AUM has gotten restricted to just the top 250 m-cap stocks. That's money chasing the same known names. But I guess with the Manpasand like blow-outs in the recent past, this has its merits.. ?
2256 2018-07-10 02:38:07 If I had the choice to buy 1 share of apple or a Sneaker! I’m choosing the shoe... this guy don’t kno that some sneakers double sometimes triple in value quicker than most stocks

2261 2018-07-10 02:33:56 Nope, I have my ideals and I do not change them on a whim. EX: right after the Parkland FL shooting Trump said he was going to work to ban bump stocks & raise gun owner age to 21. I was for this before he said it and did not change my opinion.

2277 2018-07-10 02:27:31 I see where you’re coming from in treating it like a business but there’s a middle ground and take it from me. Snipper is right definitely want to cash out. What I do is make money, cash out and put it in a retirement account or re-invest in stocks in a separate broker acct

2286 2018-07-10 02:24:29 I was able to find 400 early at IB but won’t exit because I know I can’t get back in. IB does that with all stocks after they get the caveat emptor! I saw the same shares you’re referring to, sucks they’ll go unused haha
2287 2018-07-10 02:23:28 Bump stocks and the modern sporting rifles, I have several of each of those. If you look at statistics, they are very low on the scale of violence. It’s a knee jerk reaction to want to ban them. It will serve no purpose other stop law abiding citizens from owning them.
2288 2018-07-10 02:23:03 I don't know.  I'm in limbo.
2289 2018-07-10 02:21:41 Good average too. I have 200 at 33’s hope it can get to $34-35
2290 2018-07-10 02:21:04 Higher prices seem likely, especially with a more positive resolution with China.  Fav stocks inc; FB BABA

2292 2018-07-10 02:20:35 That’s also very true!! Good point. The notional value based off of the delta. I missed that. 

I was mainly thinking of delta as a probability. You got 2 different with same delta, same probability. 

But size is also very true!
Good point!

2297 2018-07-10 02:18:06 The reason why @realDonaldTrump voters still support him is the same reason people hold onto their losing stocks. Of course, the best course of action is to cut your losses and move on! @FoxNews
2298 2018-07-10 02:17:42 and how do you feel about banning bump stocks and assault rifles?
2299 2018-07-10 02:17:31 This idea of classifying stocks as large cap/mid cap etc by AMFI-every 6 months- is very interesting. So if a stock does badly and slips from (say) large cap to mid cap, large cap funds will on the margin have to sell it even more and vice versa.
2300 2018-07-10 02:17:04 Have you seen the borrow costs for hexaware? It has gone to 4% in rollover for one month!

2327 2018-07-10 02:00:42 $TSLA doesn't trade as technical as most other stocks. Has it's own heart-beat due to the heavy shorts and heavy bulls. Doesn't trade with the $SPY, just does it's own things which is why so many people get wrecked on it.
2328 2018-07-10 02:00:12 As someone who is actively campaigning for #gunsense, this pick is the most disheartening it could be.

2332 2018-07-10 01:57:36 Have you bought stocks? There’s fees to buy it lmfao, your wasting money buying one...if you buy 1 stock at $7, it’s MINIMUM 4.99 to buy it, and to sell 4.99 again, it’d need to go up 200% just to for you to break even, or you can buy multiple...It’s stupid to buy <5 shares
2333 2018-07-10 01:56:50 Really? So when will bump stocks be banned and the minimum age to buy a gun be raised?
2334 2018-07-10 01:53:46 $ISR offering is one of the reasons why l don’t play low priced stocks and #SEC can’t do shite
2335 2018-07-10 01:51:47 Not a single person I spoke to bought stocks the last 2-3 days. Looks like Algos ramping ahead of earnings season..
2336 2018-07-10 01:51:33 Ah I had him on block forever man. Ask him how is his buddie Joe mas doing he vanished on Twitter when all just oil stocks tanked
2337 2018-07-10 01:51:07 I said "assault weapon," not "assault rifle." Though a ban on any rifle seems unconstitutional in my opinion. The demand for fully automatic fire will always exist, proven by the development of bump stocks and bump firing, and banning it just seems futile and purposeless.
2338 2018-07-10 01:51:07 Thus, we sometimes stole, and each burglary allowed us to breathe  stocks
2339 2018-07-10 01:50:04 Also, a social wealth fund is basically publically owned stocks, it’s a very capitalist based idea
2340 2018-07-10 01:48:06 My family stocks up on all the things I can’t get here....butter tarts, Bloody Caesars, pink cream soda....peacock tongue...seems a bit needy??
2341 2018-07-10 01:46:25 Our economy is FANTASTIC! Unemployment, 401Ks, housing starts, GDP, stocks, jobs! Americans got a tax cut that has made a huge difference to millions of families and small business. Are you really so short-sighted (and small-minded) that you’re not able to grasp the big picture?
2342 2018-07-10 01:45:56 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your chronic fatigue
2343 2018-07-10 01:45:41 F&O Ban 10-7-2018:

2362 2018-07-10 01:29:25 Exactly. Bergecin wants Stastny unavailable. He isnt the answer for Habs. So he helps Jets free up the cash .... to kerp him in the WC and gets a decent NHL ready player and stocks up on picks. A clever use of cap space he cant use on unavailable key personnel.

At least share value will increase

2370 2018-07-10 01:24:51 jfc and pldt stock prices are horrible metrics of measuring the impact of the boycott. emotional stockholders offloading shares only incentives long-run players to load up on stocks at discounts. 

ending contractualization would have affected their value even more.

2374 2018-07-10 01:22:46 People only buy blue chip stocks to keep their money safe and it presents a better yield on their account than a bank... maybe it has good dividends, but bottom line don’t buy no apple stock unless you already got money
2375 2018-07-10 01:22:21 Oh yeah!! With her direction, I took over her retirement account in 2009. We just keep buying the growth stocks.
2376 2018-07-10 01:21:25 Depends... I usually go with stocks but will play options if stock is a little riskier or for news like earnings... For TSLA I have this week’s 320 calls and Aug 325 calls
2377 2018-07-10 01:21:13 If I was part of the legal counsel, that's one of the first things I'd mention.
2378 2018-07-10 01:20:57 Except what is mostly going on is mergers, and boards of directors using company profits to buy back the companies stocks in order to boost dividends for another set of directors, who do the same in turn. Capitalism is an anti democratic system. Monopolies and Cartels a plenty.
2379 2018-07-10 01:20:06 Says who lol I’m not arguing that the post isn’t stupid I’m just talking stocks now. Ever hear of penny stocks? There’s multiple ways to play it and make an income
2380 2018-07-10 01:19:45 That’s not the point. The point is ignorantly stating that stocks won’t affect gamers even though they do if something goes horribly wrong. Not once did I say that the switch or Nintendo is failing.

2392 2018-07-10 01:15:42 @TheCWSupergirl is so relevant. Season 3 episode 21 shows EXACTLY why better background checks and mental health care are necessary and why bump stocks and assault weapons are unnecessary.

2410 2018-07-10 01:03:20 If you see someone tweeting every 5 min saying wealth builder, zip code changer, life changer etc and the stock just keeps going down the whole time you know it's a pump and dump! Stocks that do well on their own and are sustainable dont need to be pumped relentlessly! #redflag
2411 2018-07-10 01:02:50 For quick money, yeah. Penny stocks usually have high volatility tho so in some cases having one share of a stable stock is better. I bought a few of amazon which doesn't seem like much but that shit racked me an extra $700 profit quickly
2412 2018-07-10 01:02:15 What _is_ the maximum capacity of a bank account, anyway? Trillion dollars? Quadrillion? What's the most money anyone's ever had in their bank account, not counting weird rich people things like putting their money in investments and stocks and sketchy offshore accounts?
2413 2018-07-10 01:01:20 LMAOO I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT STOCKS AND SHIT
2414 2018-07-10 01:01:16 $CYPE updated its share structure today. $WSML posted an 8k and a form 3s.  That can't be bad.
2415 2018-07-10 01:01:13  Twitter needs to Stop F*cking with the #MAGA we vote and we buy and we buy and probably own a lot of stocks in tech companies ...
2416 2018-07-10 00:59:41 Did very well early on. 
Just holding $BIDU and $T and that early morning $TSLA call/win.
Thats it! Simple trading. Made my money and didnt chase the adrenaline.
Tomorrow is a new day. I have a bunch of #Cash

2417 2018-07-10 00:59:29 Buying stocks, done working. I'll Let my money work for me. ^_^
2418 2018-07-10 00:58:50 Fuck it. That’s how I’m coming this Fall... after I return from NY imma be a total homebody. Just gonna focus on school, stocks, and my shows and video games. I see y’all Summer 2K19
2419 2018-07-10 00:57:30 Stocks up, housing marketing up, unemployment rate records lows... I smell a crash coming 
2420 2018-07-10 00:56:49 Seeking woman to sit on my chest, snap her gum and check my stocks.
2421 2018-07-10 00:56:47 For sure :p haha
2422 2018-07-10 00:55:12 I wonder what stocks he has...
2423 2018-07-10 00:55:12 Oh sneaker culture is absolutely lit. And stocks honestly work best in larger quantities.
2424 2018-07-10 00:54:54 I also think s2j is a big factor, could take 2 stocks or could take like 10
2425 2018-07-10 00:51:29 Napanaginipan kong tataas yung stocks na meron ako. Shet. Sana totoo haha
2426 2018-07-10 00:51:24 Yep THAT DID On watch  KOOL
2427 2018-07-10 00:51:12 The sneakers are still the better buy bc you can snipe them when they drop, then flip them for 3x sticker price on eBay and then buy 2 Apple stocks and the next Jordans when they come out
2428 2018-07-10 00:51:09 You pseudo intellectuals need to stop acting like investing in the stock market is a one way ticket to riches. The 10% own 84% of all stocks. It's much harder to break into an established markets
2429 2018-07-10 00:50:34   you are entirely dependent on your employer or investor making the right stock choices.

In a recession like the one that's inevitably coming up, stocks can become worthless overnight.
2430 2018-07-10 00:49:40 We use qualified dividend paying stocks in a reg brokerage accounts. Capped at 15% tax. For investors who cant qualify for Roth.
2431 2018-07-10 00:47:11 Mad interested about who this pumper is!!!?? But yeah my first and heaviest buy was around .03, so I'm not supppppper worried :p and I took profits on the way up.
2432 2018-07-10 00:45:53 exited & end up with (-$383) loss! 
dropped so quick!
Well off to the next one!
2433 2018-07-10 00:45:19 Stocks rally for 3rd session; banks surge and erase Dow's 2018 losses
2434 2018-07-10 00:43:15 I genuinely hope that i can invest & trade in the stock market for the duration of my life. That means taking small profits, believing in my system and not having to solely rely on stocks as a lone income
2435 2018-07-10 00:42:00 In her case, a sanity test would probably solve the problem.
2436 2018-07-10 00:41:35 I'm skeptical of Miami Ohio PGs though, since Weathers had crazy numbers too out of nowhere and the teams still sucked both years. It was two different coaches though right? Still suspicious, i know the stocks for Weathers - he was able to roam as much as he wanted
2437 2018-07-10 00:40:43 So will drug pricing be in place before or after a ban on bump stocks
2438 2018-07-10 00:39:57 $AXAS btw = $$$
2439 2018-07-10 00:39:28 To be honest,if you don't see stocks dropping after E3's showcase as a sign of investor doubt, Then you're just lying to yourself. Nintendo knows it's not in trouble, so do Switch owners. People who have invested aren't sure. To be fair, 20 mil units by March is a lot.
2440 2018-07-10 00:39:26 Yeah, plays like $CYPE that come From a particular penny pusher I know are kinda on my do not touch list. You’ll make it up.
2441 2018-07-10 00:39:06 RT young_pfy5811 "TheBull_Stocks greatstockpicks Well that sucked"
2442 2018-07-10 00:38:43 Well that sucked
2443 2018-07-10 00:37:28 “Big things coming ” - dude who just invested like $10 into stocks
2444 2018-07-10 00:37:14 @HC_Haplo Sir, 
Please consider emailing me at epstein.peter4@gmail.com for a lithium stock idea. But, only if you are able to invest in Canadian-listed stocks. It trades on the TSX-V. It has a tiny market cap, much smaller than AGY, DMI, PNN & LKE. Thanks!
2445 2018-07-10 00:37:12 Not thrilled though:p made some of it up in $LIGA .
2446 2018-07-10 00:36:45 US stocks were up  by triple digits today
2447 2018-07-10 00:36:36 Short selling to be implemented on Oct!! PSEi stocks only 
2448 2018-07-10 00:36:11 My average is low, it's okay LOL
2449 2018-07-10 00:36:04 600 shares $32s great dividend
2450 2018-07-10 00:34:35 Damn.  I should have invested in pacifier stocks.
2451 2018-07-10 00:34:26 There is an much of a need to walk to bitcoin right now from a retail perspective because we are at the height of a bowl market in stocks, and we are sitting flush with a boatload of government printed money.
2452 2018-07-10 00:34:16 Shorts have no power in a stocks movement.   Never have, never will.  Why people even discuss it still baffles me.
If the company executes on the pipe line,  the stock will soar.
2453 2018-07-10 00:33:53 Aveo
2454 2018-07-10 00:33:47 $across wow
2455 2018-07-10 00:33:30 RIP
2456 2018-07-10 00:31:52 So I'm stuck in $CYPE, this happens. I swear to shit though I'm muting everyone who lumps that stock into their weekly watchlist of 80+ stocks. ....damn do some additional researcher.
2457 2018-07-10 00:31:12 @markminervini hello Mark before some leanrt risk management assume the already have stocks at 50 percent loss but a small quantity. If the company is good do you suggest to average or still take a loss and exit?
2458 2018-07-10 00:28:55 Growth stocks all the way! Value is in the eye of the beholder!
2459 2018-07-10 00:28:51 Seoul stocks open higher on U.S. gains http://30.1.1.228:8198/AEN20180710002400320
2460 2018-07-10 00:28:45 Play for blood remember?
2461 2018-07-10 00:28:16 European stocks rose on Monday, brushing aside the latest Brexit shock and posting a fifth straight advance
2462 2018-07-10 00:27:22 A modest increase in the crude oil price stoked energy stocks as Halliburton and Schlumberger jumped 2%, @conocophillips gained 1.9%, and @Chevron added 1.5%.
2463 2018-07-10 00:27:06 None.
2464 2018-07-10 00:26:53 Financial stocks led the advance as Bank of America jumped 3.6%, JP Morgan Chase climbed 3.1%, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs gained 2.8%, and Citigroup rose 2.7%.
2465 2018-07-10 00:26:45 US stocks rose on Monday, posting their third straight day of gains, with strong economic data appearing to offset worries about rising trade tensions.
2466 2018-07-10 00:26:01 I've played you a single time in bracket and at least two of my stocks definitely went to stagespike dair so
2467 2018-07-10 00:24:56 Dear Lady

American judges, attorneys, State employees r breaking constitutional laws w/out repercussions 

It seems n land of illusory freedom those n power positions both private & public sectors simply lose the ability 2 do what's best 4 humans NOT just stocks n profits
2468 2018-07-10 00:22:22 damn dude...smh
2469 2018-07-10 00:21:58 Can you believe people are making money on the marijuana stocks, So discusting, People are making money on poisoning people and killing people by marijuana stocks, Tobacco stocks, and alcohol stocks!
2470 2018-07-10 00:21:56 Here we go huge stocks @JordanChebz @John_Garrish
2471 2018-07-10 00:20:57 $Riot Short position in this stock in now over 50%. As in all stocks when you buy at the high you are usually wrong. So when you short at the low you are probably wrong as well. I expect a turnaround by the end of this week. Hard to watch it go down and hold your shares, I know
2472 2018-07-10 00:20:43 Unfortunately I’m not a day trader. Seems the only way to make any money currently. Just hoping for another mini bull like in may to break even and cash some out (buy stocks) and tether the rest until hold strategy comes back. If ever.
2473 2018-07-10 00:20:07 $AHPI - stock on watch for another explosive move to the upside.
Place this one on your watch list.

2474 2018-07-10 00:19:31 Start of US earnings season this week may divert some attention away from the trade war that’s kept global stocks under pressure. The U.S. June jobs report showed another month of gains >200,000 and expectations for earnings growth of 20% for 2ndQ relative to 14% 1stQ.
2475 2018-07-10 00:18:15 This is a business news emergency broadcast. The Independents are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  F stocks. Thank you for tuning into  CNBC.
2476 2018-07-10 00:18:06 Theory: The reason dividend paying stocks have outperformed in long run studies has more to do with the fact the underlying companies had steady enough FCF to commit to a generous & growing dividend and less to do with the actual cash payments. 1/3

2481 2018-07-10 00:15:52 You should start investing in stocks.
2482 2018-07-10 00:15:14 The adult in me bought stocks

2489 2018-07-10 00:03:23 I would definitely buy the album, if kpopconn has ready-stocks
2490 2018-07-10 00:03:00 Robinhood app is legit. Practice up on penny stocks, and when you have your money right, you can really invest and actually know what’s up
2491 2018-07-10 00:02:20 Every bonus given for 2018, was already projected from the previous year!  The Tax Cut for corporations and the 1%, almost always goes to “Buybacks” and stocks! Projection: Corp. will have $$$ tied up in stock/ BB’s. Thus, no raises. Typical 3% bonus...Status quo. Line pockets!
2492 2018-07-10 00:02:11 Good job, you just posted exactly what the other dude kept saying. Bad business practices caused the company to fail which caused their stock to sink to bankruptcy levels. Again keep thinking stocks don’t affect gamers. They’re unimportant
2493 2018-07-10 00:02:00 False. You make double once you see the market go up and that’s how you profit from stocks itd just take some time
2494 2018-07-10 00:01:47 Thread actually had examples of cheaper stocks.  I used apple as only an example for the comparison not as an actual stock to purchase.
