6 2018-11-19 23:59:06 While the oil sands might be generating lots of money for Canada, they are still polluting our environment! Who cares if we have money if we have no planet to live on!!

8 2018-11-19 23:58:57 I'm impressed. As a teen I was a helper when my Dad & Uncle split tractors, rebuilt engines, etc. An older brother stayed out of the shop. He's moved back to the area and now runs the land. Except for oil & lube he doesn't touch engines or trans. Dealer does it all.

32 2018-11-19 23:58:27 As well, to date there has been $217 billion invested in the oil sands industry (Government of Canada, 2016) So yes, we do care about money because it helps Canada prosper.

35 2018-11-19 23:58:14 I wouldn’t say all that lol. Majority of us rely on oil companies my brother
36 2018-11-19 23:58:14 The question was never who gets oil. The question was alwsys, who gets rich from oil? Our military serves and benefit rich owners of American petrochemical industry but is unjustly paid for by taxpayers. Thats not capitalism, its fraud!

38 2018-11-19 23:57:35 Bath them the night before with baby oil, ivory and warm water. The oil helps them clip out evenly. I use lots of cool spray and oil, and always use sharp blades. After I’m done clipping, I hot towel them with a bit of warm water and baby oil.

41 2018-11-19 23:57:27 linseed oil or shellac is what i use. nice and cheap
42 2018-11-19 23:57:26 A workable fix that would be neutral while still allowing states to retain control of domestic agendas would be fixing gold cost of oil.  IE - say gold is 500 bbls of oil.  So if you are EU & want cheap energy, you can have cheap gold; if US and want expensive oil for shale, etc.
43 2018-11-19 23:57:09 Its literally nothing but sugar and oil....
44 2018-11-19 23:57:03 Here at Alberta Oil Sands, we care about our employees. Did you know that the oil industry employs over 400,000 people either directly or indirectly in Canada? (Government of Canada, 2016)
45 2018-11-19 23:57:02 There is not one prosperous muslim majority nation on the entire planet that is not oil rich. And n those nation's women r slaves. So lets honor the hijab.

47 2018-11-19 23:56:59 I just had to pay for my own oil change. Is this what adulting feels like?
48 2018-11-19 23:56:32 Yeah whatever happened to that whole metrosexual thing from a few years back? Now we have beard oil. But that’s about it. Male cosmetics I think are still an uphill battle against toxic (traditional) masculinity.
49 2018-11-19 23:56:25 I’m gonna need people to quit telling me to use coconut oil or cocoa butter to fix everything bc I KNOW THE TRUTH  Lol
50 2018-11-19 23:56:24 Norway is the second-largest offshore oil and gas producer (2017), with more than double the production of the UK.  I don't see Denmark or Estonia on the top-ten list.

56 2018-11-19 23:55:45 I’m literally gonna start charging people $3 a head to get in my car. Like my car was so dirty & 75% of that mess wasn’t even mine. On top of gas & oil changes? That’s my time & money wasted down the drain cause I’m getting tired of up keeping my car every 2weeks & dropping $50.
57 2018-11-19 23:55:44 I make my own for my sensitive areas. Brown sugar, honey, and olive oil(: works amazing No problem hope you get it. Honestly it’s life changing and your hair really gets thinner and thinner as you go 11/10 recommend
58 2018-11-19 23:55:34 @oil_alberta people don’t understand how bad the tar sands are!! Be aware, all companies like @oil_alberta care about is money!
59 2018-11-19 23:55:24 Idiot. What is this person actually seeing?
60 2018-11-19 23:55:22 Does that include the oil and gas industry?
61 2018-11-19 23:55:07 Those jobs are active duty, in combat, trying help Saudi + Israel exert undue influence in the region. We sacrifice our children for that + to keep the owners of global warming petro-chem cos rich. Gulf war costs s/b incl to gas prices + paid by oil cos. not taxpayers.
62 2018-11-19 23:54:53 And China is an oil importing dictatorship so it have no option other than giving it’s subject capacity to revolt for a “corruption charge”, “tax evasion” and inflation tax purpose.

69 2018-11-19 23:54:22 In casual conversation, at a oil stop, a man brought up politics. 

I calmly said “So I see you support Trump?”. 

Reply was stern, paranoid & defensive. 

“YES!, and I have guns too!”

Me: uuuum, ok. Have a nice day. 

What in the land have we come to!?!?! Why so mad? Sad!
70 2018-11-19 23:54:17 The industry obviously wants you to use the smallest optical number.  I suppose you could have said 41,666 oil changes

74 2018-11-19 23:53:20 There’s nothing wrong with collecting taxes to fund public services. The issue is that in Lagos, the taxes aren’t used for funding public services, just like oil revenue isn’t used for funding public services in Nigeria. So, resource misallocation is the problem.

102 2018-11-19 23:50:12 I also believe scientists. I believe climate change is a thing. I also believe that unethical producers with low to nonexistent environmental policies and control are the culprits not Canada and not the oil sands and not pipelines.

111 2018-11-19 23:49:13 WRONG. The driver of the price is the UN and the trade deals that we have with our neighbours. Oil dropped from $150 to under US$30/barrel. What happened to the price of electricity? It went UP. #IllusionOfChoice #GlobalistsVSAustralians
112 2018-11-19 23:49:11 Corporate media don’t report the real issues that are happening in our country. Judges are taking our rights from us, judges are giving corp the right to drill for oil in protected land deregulation of big banks and etc. People need to know the truth and they are not getting it.

130 2018-11-19 23:47:04 So many pundits are pro oil it invokes much suspicion.
Where is the "balance" on these types of "news" programs. Extremely tired of hearing the whining from Alberta.
131 2018-11-19 23:46:50 You drop that entire thing "as is" in boiling hot peanut oil.  Video it please.  (People in the South, I am kidding, you will probably burn your neighborhood down)

142 2018-11-19 23:45:19 He'll get $TSLA owner volunteers to run extension cords from their houses! #FreeLabor - Why not #ElectricitySharing? Plus it will be an opportunity for new members of the "Tesla family" to get their EV buddies, who can keep an eye out for the subterfuge of big oil & shorts.

145 2018-11-19 23:44:57 @LloydMize150 LLoyd, I trust all is well? I am putting a full court press on getting inspections. Any advice you can give me? In addition to oil paintings for home inspections I offer wine tasting any time :-)
146 2018-11-19 23:44:52 Huge fan of this “put CBD oil in everything” craze
147 2018-11-19 23:44:32 Dri is better but I agree people need to wake up. The GM has set this team back by at least 5 years woth the moves he has made. Hall, EBs, top draft picks for a non roster player. It’s so sad what could have been to what is. GM has to go. Who would you want as another GM?

152 2018-11-19 23:43:35 There’s benefits in CBD oil. This yogurt just doesn’t have THC, which is what gets you high.
153 2018-11-19 23:43:11 Palm oil in UK food products has to labeled as such
154 2018-11-19 23:43:08 I already know I need to do my oil change this weekend. Fml
155 2018-11-19 23:42:59 2 cups of Flax meal, 2 cups of Black Chia, 1 and a half or 2 cups of coconut oil or butter or Ghee (your choice) 
I also use 1 cup of freshly crushed Pepitas. 5 tspns of baking powder, 1 tspn of Celtic salt ( your salt choice) 4 free range eggs..
156 2018-11-19 23:42:22 My poor face has been doused in coconut oil for the past two weeks
157 2018-11-19 23:42:12 Most Republicans think Al Gore said he invented the Internet, or that Nancy Pelosi said "we have to pass it to know what's in it," or - as the @GOP standard bearer insisted - that Barack Obama was born in Kenya. Don't fucking lecture us on "nakedly acting in bad faith."
158 2018-11-19 23:42:11 You're not a journalist. Journalists report oil spills, opiod deaths, Chinese hacking, corporate criminals, etc. You peddle hate. Its insane

160 2018-11-19 23:41:47 FAST EXPLANATION OF WHAT FRACKING DOES... OIL WELL STARTS TO DRY UP IN SOME CASES...OIL COMPANY DECIDES TO INSERT WATER HOSE INTO THE GROUND AND PUMP IN WATER;DRIVES OIL TO THE SURFACE WHERE IT CAN BE PUMPED OUT EASIER WATER TABLE GETS CONTAMINATED WITH OIL.RUINS DRINKING WATER
161 2018-11-19 23:41:32 That’s why imma start taking cod liver oil capsules
162 2018-11-19 23:41:29 Just to let you’s know Nutella and Oreo use palm oil so try avoid buying them and continuing deforestation, I know there are loads of products that use the oil but just keep an eye out on what you buy in the future and save the owl Orangutan’s they’re whopper
163 2018-11-19 23:41:27 America has used its defence forces to illegal invade Iraq.protect oil company's from the killing by its henchmen supported by the CIA ...
164 2018-11-19 23:41:22 There was an oil spill in the House of Assembly???  Misplaced modifier maybe
165 2018-11-19 23:41:19 Who's subsidising who? 

Under recovery is the new name of Oil subsidy.

The joke is on you Mr President.
166 2018-11-19 23:41:13 So Saudi Arabia is and Russia are banking on Trump putting strict sanctions on Iran so oil prices will go up?

It seems everything Trump does is to help their economies. 

Is this his way of "paying" them back for the loans and election help?
167 2018-11-19 23:41:08 CBC Here and Now reported oil platform Sea Rose recorded a 103 foot wave last week. 10 story building. Google reports the record was 100 ft.
168 2018-11-19 23:40:59 I propose a refinery right on T'suu Tina land and the other reserves in the area take up Algae farming.. We will reduce the price of fuel and increase the the production of greener fuel for all at a t lower cost. Solving concerns of opposition and crushing there fears. Hybrid oil
169 2018-11-19 23:40:58 Yesterday I changed my own oil. Praise be unto me for completing this basic task I probably should’ve learned years ago.
170 2018-11-19 23:40:56 #Putin didn’t see it that way. Without restoring socialism, he dispossessed  #Khodorkovsky of Yukos and essentially transformed the oil and gas  industry from the “open society” model tolerated by Yeltsin to a national capitalist industry.

174 2018-11-19 23:40:27 We’re going to run out of economically recoverable fossil fuels. All the easy stuff has been taken, shallow oil wells aren’t filing back up, coal isn’t gonna come closer to the surface, combustion as a primary source of energy is not an option in any future.
175 2018-11-19 23:40:17 Thought the issue was development of pristine natural areas. That said, taxes on oil exports could go towards preservation
176 2018-11-19 23:40:12 I tried their Marula Oil earlier this year and rly liked it! I hope to one day make salary that can accommodate my love for their products

180 2018-11-19 23:39:44 Chicken of th Woods Mushroom are th best

Th taste and texture is very similar to chicken but better. Cook them in lots of oil with salt and pepper. OMG!!
181 2018-11-19 23:39:29 @GalaxyChocolate your chocolate is the best I've found in the UK, but I just realised you make it with palm oil.

I don't think I can promise I'll never eat it again, but you should know that I'm consciously looking for alternatives & buying less as a result.
182 2018-11-19 23:39:27 Just to clarify here, it wasn’t just one question then passed over. QP was 50-50 Canopy and oil spill. 

I just didn’t tweet the rest of Crosbie’s line of questioning as I didn’t really hear new info.

185 2018-11-19 23:39:01 Can you get them to buy Alberta oil while you’re there? Or get them to employ our out of work construction workers in their future builds?
#thanks
186 2018-11-19 23:38:59 It’s freaking vertical with vegetable oil.
187 2018-11-19 23:38:56 Nocciolata I've heard is quite similar in taste and has no palm tree oil
188 2018-11-19 23:38:44 Then there is that whole buying oil from a country that represses women and kills journalists because....you know....shipping and selling our own ethically produced oil via pipeline in a country with rigorous environmental standards is evil.
189 2018-11-19 23:38:42 Diesel engine was (for what I know and its debatable) based on hemp oil. It was the big oil that pushed for it to be illegal. Hemp has more uses then fossil fuels. 
There is hints that hemp oil was one of the medicinal oils used as far back as 3k years.

Stop letting them do that. You'll run out of lives to give, and or fucks to give again.
193 2018-11-19 23:38:12 Sounds normal if you’re getting something added. Normal pedicure usually 20. Say you get an oil or extra treatment (I get peppermint lol) another 10. & then another 10 since it’s gel/no chip.

198 2018-11-19 23:37:43 @PnPCBC the price differential for Canada's oil is frustrating. The historic Crow Rate for shipping wheat by rail ended. Are we calling for a "Crow Rate" to support the fossil fuel industry? Heavy Oil faces the juggernaut of world production.  #cdnpoli
199 2018-11-19 23:37:20 Not to mention the mystery oil in the can you end up intaking. Proper closed loop system can eliminate both of these problems.

210 2018-11-19 23:35:28 I use this as my daily moisturizer but use Shishedo eye cream at night, along with the Oil of Olay night cream on the rest of my face and neck, and sleep with a humidifier. Also exfoliate so that your skin can absorb the stuff.

217 2018-11-19 23:34:57 @bbc5live could you ask the dietician why we continue to limit healthy saturated fat such as butter, yoghurt and coconut oil when there’s no evidence to support this approach. Should processed foods, refined carbs & sugar should be limited instead? Mark Hancock - Horndean

220 2018-11-19 23:34:41 Know the ingredients or even care. Not everyone looks at the ingredient list. gets hives from shadows either. Instead of saying she's lying, you could just give her a pr statement and nicely say "maybe its the red dye. Try using a oil based makeup remover and see a dermatologist"
221 2018-11-19 23:34:38 This is a weird nostalgia trip - Hess Trucks are for some reason a semi-cherished Christmas tradition in my family, and we're British. I don't think they even operate here. It took me a long time to realise they were a real oil company.
222 2018-11-19 23:34:34 Lots of oil trophy wives though 
223 2018-11-19 23:34:23 @PnPCBC  The REAL truth is that other countries don't want our low grade "dirty" oil, not even China.

228 2018-11-19 23:33:56 Nobody “deserves” anything. The people who voted voted overwhelmingly for change. Not for the same old ‘taking money from big oil and big Pharma while I introduce legislation to block #M4A’.
229 2018-11-19 23:33:53 Wait so oils work for you? I feel like putting oil in my hair just makes it oilier & I just feel gross. also it doesnt help moisturize my scalp.

236 2018-11-19 23:32:35 Good stuff for them. Lucas loves my fish oil capsules.
237 2018-11-19 23:32:31 another funny thing was that this APC Government has been claiming to have reduced imports drastically and increased exports, so how do you now want us to cut them some slacks cos the exchange rate is high because we import alot and export only oil?
238 2018-11-19 23:32:24 The oil companies should stop putting oil out and dry out the Canadian government revenues. You will see on how fast the pipelines get finally built. It's actually a joke on how the government is running our country!
239 2018-11-19 23:32:12 CBD ? As in CBD oil ?
240 2018-11-19 23:32:09 Just as long as we still have fish when the finite oil runs out.
241 2018-11-19 23:31:46 Well it seems unlikely. When demonetization and GST and oil prices don’t effect us then CBI mess is just a 9pm news.
242 2018-11-19 23:31:45 Cda’s Min of NatResources: we must destroy BC’s environment, fishing industry and tourist industry to save the oil industry for AB because the #Liberals are owned by the #fossilfuelindustry and B.C. simply does not matter.

260 2018-11-19 23:30:20 omfg, the long-term solution isn't to find new oil customers, @SohiAmarjeet.

275 2018-11-19 23:28:21 About to get an oil change, can’t wait for them to tell me my car is gonna die in 2 days if I don’t get everything replaced right now.
276 2018-11-19 23:27:54 There’s nothing more satisfying as to being able to change the oil in your own pickup.
277 2018-11-19 23:27:52 Looking for Asian flavors?

Play around with ginger, honey, sesame oil, tamari, red pepper flakes, orange zest, garlic, onion, & tahini
 YUM!

280 2018-11-19 23:27:13 Whoever came up with the idea to put CBD oil in cocktails... thank you...
281 2018-11-19 23:26:46 Trying to oil my knees cause I know my old ass is going to be in the strut line this weekend.
282 2018-11-19 23:26:40 Friendly reminder to everyone who will be feasting on Thanksgiving -

PLEASE do not try to thaw a turkey in oil. Will save a lot of trouble :]
283 2018-11-19 23:26:39 The truth needs to be heard I know that’s very hard for you Fox News watchers there only get your information from them ! Donald J Trump is a liar a cheat and a thief that’s a fact, a glorified snake oil salesman
284 2018-11-19 23:26:20 Dear I pray for Syria & her people. US\West focus Syria is exploit her gas, oil & path of gas lines to EU. The terrorist in Syria are proxy of these Western cartels, elitists. Syria is a foundation country for humanity past and home for varied cultures & religions. GodBlessSyria!
285 2018-11-19 23:26:07 Essential oils fix everything. Mosquito problem eucalyptus oil. Don’t want your dogs chewing on things peppermint oil. Headaches? Orange citrus oil.
286 2018-11-19 23:25:57 To be fair the NOK also didn't participate during the strong oil rebound off the lows. It actually continued weakening.
287 2018-11-19 23:25:50 As intended, my friend. Keep the bitch slaps coming. Some days, they’re the only thing that make Twitterland worth visiting.
288 2018-11-19 23:25:39 My favorite oil to use is 
Sesame Oil but.. We try to also keep
Olive Oil, Avocado Oil, & Coconut Oil on hand
289 2018-11-19 23:25:31 yes ma'am!  deep fried in peanut oil...injected w Seasoning...delicious
290 2018-11-19 23:25:24 Make a dry rub, cover the bird in olive oil & dry rub and separate the breast skin from the meat....work oil and dry rub up inside that space, then cook the bird UPSIDE DOWN. It will not look like a brown, picture perfect bird for your platter, but it will be moist and delicious.
291 2018-11-19 23:25:23 Coat your eyelids with coconut oil. It’ll help take off the staining and helps sooth the swelling and irritation.
292 2018-11-19 23:25:20 Investors don't want to purchase more oil cars with a 20+ year service life because they will go under utilized if the pipelines get built.  Notley has offered to step up and buy them. Desperate measures, but these are desperate times.

295 2018-11-19 23:25:17 go get an oil cleanser and go to your dermatologist and be done with it. You’re embarrassing yourself.
296 2018-11-19 23:25:15 Mundell the Brit Governor General/ Snake oil salesman completely unconvincing  #scotnight
297 2018-11-19 23:25:05 Wow! So you are saying that someone that doesn't know you should make your decisions...well enough said..but I for one do not want alotbof regulations. Oh and we absolutely should drill oil...
298 2018-11-19 23:25:02 I'll have to look closer lol. We have "Farmers' Markets" here twice a week.
I usually saute them in olive oil with basic seasonings. My theory is: people who hate them have probably only eaten boiled sprouts.
299 2018-11-19 23:24:48 building coal-fired power stations over there. Have we been told in how that promise is going to be fulfilled and is it tied to a return to the participating countries? Viz. East Timor and its oil fields. #EnergyPNG
300 2018-11-19 23:24:45 And she said that was proof of her foreign policy experience. Insane. She also made that insane quote about Putin rearing his head over the horizon; easily dumber than Fey’s fake line on SNL
301 2018-11-19 23:24:39 If anyone need car work done hmu. Oil/fluid changes, brakes, wheel bearings, over heating issues, ac work, misfire, anything small I will come to you. Cheaper than any mechanic. Tryna get a shop going lmk.
302 2018-11-19 23:24:36 I want to know who let the cat out the bag about the secret oil fields in the first place!!
303 2018-11-19 23:24:22 C'mon, pretty sure that was off the books last year ;)
304 2018-11-19 23:24:21 Just the problem Charles. Generally people do get it. But the ones with the power to do something about it don't. There's a leadership vacuum in Ottawa, Victoria and Quebec that's crippling the potential of Canada to be a global leader in oil and gas.

307 2018-11-19 23:23:53 Well, change is what people voted for. Not multi millionaires who got that way from accepting money from big oil and big Pharma.
308 2018-11-19 23:23:31 Remember if you're frying your turkey, 350 oil and straight out the freezer or you'll overcook the skin #safeanddelicious

312 2018-11-19 23:23:19 I have found out anything with tea tree oil in it is my favorite smell.
313 2018-11-19 23:22:56 @mmtoyota TERRIBLE Experience at the service department - please reach out so I can share what happened... 3.5 hours and still here for an oil change and a tire... with an appointment....
314 2018-11-19 23:22:54 Cut Xs in a pork roast, stuff with onion, garlic, and bell pepper, flour. Season to taste. Brown in oil on high until brown on all sides. Then out in a slow cooker on low for 8 hours. Easy Peasy!  Surprise your hubby!
315 2018-11-19 23:22:41 I was speeding and didn’t see I guess a bump and the car hit the bottom of the car damaging my oil pan so oil was spilling so my car was smoking
316 2018-11-19 23:22:29 Massively hypocritical move. Where exactly does your concern for deforestation for palm oil come from? Because it certainly isn’t an environmental or animal welfare concern if you’re happy to remove vegan products to sell more animal body parts and secretions.
317 2018-11-19 23:22:29 No more subsidies for oil companies.
318 2018-11-19 23:22:12 U.S oil production has outpaced that of Saudi Arabia  and Russia  supply to market and lending to an influx of stockpiles in the could put more pressure on OPEC
319 2018-11-19 23:22:02 Well thank you! I take that as the highest praise possible
320 2018-11-19 23:22:02 There are real limits here.  Saudi Arabia could readily turn to China or Russia for arms, and then the United States would be out in the cold with little influence. Heavy sanctions could lead to a huge oil price spike for the West.
321 2018-11-19 23:22:00 italians are basically mayonnaise and olive oil..they’re the blacks of the white community
322 2018-11-19 23:21:44 I gotchu for the 10 just bring the oil and the filter
323 2018-11-19 23:21:42 Is Ryan Howard off the books? :-)
324 2018-11-19 23:21:41 “Changing oil filters can be a pain in the ass” “well don’t put it there then “ hooo”
325 2018-11-19 23:21:34 our oil money ooh
326 2018-11-19 23:21:30 Why doesn’t Trunp release free energy to counter the oil dependency. Is it because his pals are making a fortune on oil and electricity?
327 2018-11-19 23:21:29 ..and its great for this time of year - filling and slow-releasing carbs.. I make mine with dairy-free milk (usually Oatly actually),  coconut oil and coconut sugar.. oh and slippery elm powder too.
328 2018-11-19 23:21:18 Your methane leak rate is too low. Natural gas leaks at least ~double that rate, which puts methane on par with coal for its climate impact. I use coal, oil, and gas to teach my students about solids, liquids, and gases; with the take home message that gas (methane) leaks!
329 2018-11-19 23:21:14 Legally investment on oil and gas is correct. Nothing else man.
330 2018-11-19 23:21:10 Genesis 28:18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.
331 2018-11-19 23:21:04 do what kimi does
stay extra olive oil!
332 2018-11-19 23:20:37 I'm going to make a guess that, it happened during the giant storm the other day and by the time they realized, the storm dispersed the oil so much as to not be able to do anything about it. But they don't want to say that.
333 2018-11-19 23:20:37 What a genius to finally figure that out after years of selling crude oil at huge discounts. Hopefully in next 5 years she will figure out a way to narrow the discount.  Oh wait, by then electric cars will make oil redundant.
334 2018-11-19 23:20:33 [comms brainstorm] don't laugh, but my grappling hook is jammed and i'm stuck hanging over the oil reservoir, please help

337 2018-11-19 23:20:20 I wanna know what @CadburyUK is doing about the palm oil issue, caused when creating their products; and how they are solving the issue!? Honestly feel like #boycotting, knowing I’m giving my money to an organisation that is causing greater harm than good! #palmoil #orangutans
338 2018-11-19 23:20:15 Got my car from the shop. For $1,400 it had better never leak oil again, or anything else except maybe gold.

347 2018-11-19 23:19:06 @MHallFindlay Great piece on CTV News Network.  Don Martin is clueless when it comes to understanding that a slump in the oil patch effects all of Canada.  He has bought the Climate Barbie kool aid.  I don't get my oil and gas info from the Canadian lame stream media.
348 2018-11-19 23:19:04 While changing the oil in Jamie’s car...

353 2018-11-19 23:18:33 I feel like spilling/breaking my only bottle of peace and calming essential oil is symbolic to how my life is going at this point
354 2018-11-19 23:18:27 I got suspended for declaring somebodies morality had been stunted.
355 2018-11-19 23:18:19 Especially with rumours floating about, that OPEC might cut production which would mean higher oil prices
356 2018-11-19 23:18:19 Coal kind of stalled 1990-2000 too. I would't bet my house on this 2017-plateau. But let's hope for a lasting coal-plateau, exponential growth for renewables and such bad diplomatic ties to certain countries that oil and gas prices skyrocket ...
357 2018-11-19 23:18:02 Nah, it was actually kinda fun in a weird way. Except for the friend of mine who lost his Limited Editions of Lord of the Rings... all three books in one, pretty much kindling. Not as bad as the oil we were trying to make in our class though...
358 2018-11-19 23:18:01 Stop using dirty palm oil for your cookies. You Rainforest abusing asshats.
359 2018-11-19 23:18:00 He probably charged you like $200 for that oil change too

362 2018-11-19 23:17:48 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
363 2018-11-19 23:17:46 Will they? no - Should they? Absolutely yes! These are two nothing clubs that were illegally given money to put them where they are now! Anyone think Pep would be their manager if he wasn’t getting obnoxious money from the evil oil tyrants? Too right he wouldn’t!

373 2018-11-19 23:16:42 Glad this sears allowed me to make an appointment for an oil change right when they close!!!!
374 2018-11-19 23:16:31 It's the UK's oil!
375 2018-11-19 23:16:30 I agree. But if they’re going to support a industry, like they do with nearly every industry (oil, health care, defense contractors, banks) why not support emerging green companies
376 2018-11-19 23:16:25 Ya I think u can eat it but I would look up what oil they use to cook their food
377 2018-11-19 23:16:23 As the vote was 46/54 I'm fairly confident in my view. If something happened to the oil fund or the Russians invaded we would need national unity.

381 2018-11-19 23:15:25 I’m going to win the lottery and then buy an oil company and change the name to “Euler’s Oil”. Then I will change the method for weighing barrels of oil and create a new unit called a “yooler.” That way when I make a sale, it will be seven yoolers of Eulers oil
382 2018-11-19 23:15:25 After Phillies said they wound spend “stupid money” this off season, probably made sense for Yanks to make this type of deal
383 2018-11-19 23:15:20 Everyone is going mad over products that contain palm oil but I dont see them giving up their takeaway coffee cups or plastic straws on nights out. The country got rid of plastic bags by adding a fee to them we should look at the same for straws/cups etc.
384 2018-11-19 23:15:13 Same here. The basil leaves an incredible scent for days. I also like Murphy’s oil soap for hardwood.

389 2018-11-19 23:14:26 she should use oil base makeup remover & consult her doctor as she may have allergic reaction to some pigments. But don't call her a liar and seeking attention. It's just bad for your image
390 2018-11-19 23:14:06 I do not think that even YOU believe what you Tweet. Cannot wait for 2019 so we will not have to listen to your drivel. Where have you been for the past 3 years? Now an election is coming you are fighting for oil? Bye bye!!!
391 2018-11-19 23:13:52 Are you ever gonna pump oil money into this, or were we duped to believe you got connections?Looks to me you're just a bunch of poor shitters.

404 2018-11-19 23:12:46 My mom rubbed lard on my chest as a kid & covered it with a hanky. It broke up the phlegm really good! These days I rub 3 droos of Oil of Oregano on my feet every few days to build up my immunity. Haven't been sick in over 5 yrs. Either way you smell like crap.
405 2018-11-19 23:12:41 Ahead of the coming #EIAReport, the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) shed another 729,000 barrels over the past week down to 652.6 million; down by 11M for 2018. This is taxpayer oil that is sold to commercial entities; hence added to commercial storage/use. #OOTT

417 2018-11-19 23:11:17 As much as I love Norway, I was shocked to see that they are RIGHT NOW exploring for new oil near the Gt Australian Bight and also in the far north. Now under the new name "Equinor".
418 2018-11-19 23:11:08 Oh, I don't have any degrees. That is why I believe in climate change. I read what scientists said and listened to what scientists said and I believed them. My mom believes oil company execs and Republican politicians but I don't understand why she or anyone else would.

423 2018-11-19 23:10:46 Then you are doing it wrong.  Cover the bird in olive oil, separate the breast skin from the meat and work oil and dry rub up inside and then cook the bird upside down.  You will not get a picture perfect browned bird to put on a platter, but it will be moist and delicious.

431 2018-11-19 23:09:37 Do you drive your car around and just hope it doesn’t run out of oil? No, you check it often and make sure. Pregnancy tests are like 5$ you can basically afford to take one every 30 days finding coins off the street. I find that extremely reasonable. I think planned parenthood1/2

441 2018-11-19 23:08:09 Well we know that China has poisoned a lot of African waterways with sub standard pipes (all about Oil & Gold).  They have invested in indoctrination through education. Have influenced SAfrica in their current genocide.  What next.

443 2018-11-19 23:07:49 You buy your clothes from sweatshops, your iPhone comes from child labor, your meat is slaughtered by human beings who suffer mental trauma from their work, your shampoo contains palm oil destroying rain forests. There is no ethical consumption under capitalism.
444 2018-11-19 23:07:20 I am not arguing a position on GW either. I am arguing that natural resources have a finite amount which has led & will lead to wars, pollution, political conflict. Oil/NG/Coal. New quantities are not replacing what we use up on a 1:1 basis.

457 2018-11-19 23:05:30 BUT it can't go on for ever and it is not making the money it was. You cannot rely on oil to balance the books.  Even the discredited GCR said that!
458 2018-11-19 23:05:13 I never knew that French fries made in truffle oil are about as good as hours of receiving oral sex with a lubed finger in my ass.
459 2018-11-19 23:05:06 Blade wash is worth it. I prefer it to the sprays. Oil motor regularly and brush off loose hair. Pony should be as clean as possible and Showsheen the daylights out of them for a few days before.
460 2018-11-19 23:05:01 Right.

I suck at growing bec I don't have a controlled system (hydroponics, timed lights etc). My last crop of plants died in a heat wave.

Other options: meeting wholesalers (dispensary suppliers) - farmers, bakers, vape oil makers. Cannabis conventions are great for that.
461 2018-11-19 23:04:57 We produce enough #oil to be self-sufficient how can you let other countries still maintain our prices ?

469 2018-11-19 23:04:05 Mr. Kenney, I think you should point out that only Dilbit is sold at a reduced price. Areas where oil is extracted with pumpjacks or SAGD, get WTI prices. The Dilbit is sold at a reduced price because the bitumen is "Diluted" with condensate so it can flow in pipelines. #UCPROX

531 2018-11-19 22:56:28 Then why don’t you bring all of our troops back home from all of These Middle Eastern countries. You and those big greedy oil companies will not leave the Middle East because of their oil resources.

540 2018-11-19 22:55:44 @PnPCBC Once again, while discussing oil and pipelines, there is no one to speak for BC or First Nations who oppose Alberta’s dirty dilbit.
541 2018-11-19 22:55:36 Fk them let eat oil
542 2018-11-19 22:55:21 Better start building those pipelines and oil refineries!
543 2018-11-19 22:55:19 Oklahoma has a ton of oil and gas deposits... California used to primarily  be a resource extraction state too btw.
544 2018-11-19 22:55:18 Quit playin. He was definitely olive oil 
545 2018-11-19 22:55:11 Thank you. It was fucked up when I bleached it so I had to use hella oil

547 2018-11-19 22:55:02 Nutella is 32% palm oil stop buying it:(
548 2018-11-19 22:54:59 Not sure how building more pipelines and therefore adding to the world's supply would increase the price of oil enough that mining the tar sands would be economically viable over the long term.... Usually increasing supply would reduce price.

550 2018-11-19 22:54:45 I worry hardcore anti-Trump resistors are like an engine revving at full RPMs without any motor oil. Pretty soon, a piston arm will snap or the engine will seize up. I felt the same way about the anti-Obama brigade circa 2009. Constant rage is unhealthy.

560 2018-11-19 22:53:45 Backstrap I like to throw some olive oil in a ziplock bag or bread pan, shake in garlic powder (or granulated garlic), Lawry's Seasoning Salt, & Montreal Steak seasoning. W/the bread pan I cut the straps into lengths that fit and roll them in the mixture to coat. Bag travels well
561 2018-11-19 22:53:45 ha ha you must be kidding @DonMartinCTV have you seen her opposition? He couldn't do better, it's a crisis that she didn't create but she's leading us better than many could. PC's had 40 yrs to get our oil to new markets but didn't.
562 2018-11-19 22:53:42 You have support from other provinces two  time to get our oil moving
563 2018-11-19 22:53:41 Ms. Stubbs... I agree. Forget TMX and Keystone XL.. focus on "Upgraders" and Energy East. We have a Canadian market for Alberta oil. You have the voice in Ottawa so make it heard... Eastern Canada needs Alberta oil.
564 2018-11-19 22:53:39 If you apply olive oil on top of French bread sprinkling Za'atar, oh wow yummmmmmy
565 2018-11-19 22:53:36 I disagree. The majority of electorate in Eastern Canada, Central Canada and the lower mainland are ignorant to the truth with respect to environmental sustainability in the oil and gas sector!
Also, this central Canadian colonialism has existed since PM Laurier, 1905!

568 2018-11-19 22:53:10 MDMA is derived from processing oil from sassafras trees, as a result is leading to destruction of rainforests

570 2018-11-19 22:53:02 A recent article said we’d be supplying 80% of the worlds oil in 5 years. The situation in Syria is about as bad. That’s over a natural gas pipeline. Assad, another “dictator” doesn’t want the pipeline through his country because they’re not getting paid. Of course they have oil
571 2018-11-19 22:52:59 So you're in favor of ending subsidies to oil and natural gas companies too?
Cool, good to know.
How about farm subsidies while we're at it?

Mix the honey and sugar. Add Vaseline and mix well. Add olive oil and mix well. Put into container to store. Each batch should be good for one week.

596 2018-11-19 22:50:10 Funny seeing these oil analysts who for yrs have said, a change in the price of oil (Brent/WTI) takes 6 to 9 months to filter down to the pump and affect consumers.

...now they say, consumers will have more money to spend this holiday. lol

598 2018-11-19 22:50:05 Today Notley talked about the widening oil differential as a "real and present danger," obviously a serious issue. But since then I've been replaying scenes from Clear and Present Danger in my head (unfortunately Tom Clancy is not a relation). #ableg
599 2018-11-19 22:49:43 @PnPCBC you should point out that exporting tar sands oil will not have an effect on quality oil imports in eastern Canada.
600 2018-11-19 22:49:38 @PnPCBC why not ask our PM what he is doing to improve relations with AB? Fed have done nothing to support AB oil and gas industry
601 2018-11-19 22:49:35 He got just barely over 50% to buy his snake oil each time he’s run for office.
602 2018-11-19 22:49:30 @PnPCBC  The oil resource Alberta owns is like owning a 1956 Edsel.
603 2018-11-19 22:49:27 As for the stains, most bright eyeshadows do that but it easily goes away with some type of oil (coconut, argan, olive, etc.) so maybe try that to remove it completely

610 2018-11-19 22:48:42 It won't ,the Keynesian corrupted Phillips Curve is utter rubbish and volatile oil prices just add to peaks and troughs & don't affect real inflation and its trend ,which has one cause, demand pull
611 2018-11-19 22:48:41 lol na na na... Saudis can't build anything, just buying anything with oil money and then killing children and innocent people. This is a terror country!

614 2018-11-19 22:48:07 What kind of cases did you put the phones in? I've had really good luck with life proof brand cases. 

Also, I have some oil field friends, concrete guys and tradesmen that swear by called "Sonim". Their latest is called an XP7.
615 2018-11-19 22:47:56 Even with oil there were only 7yrs in a total of 50 since discovery that oil would have lead to Scotland running a surplus. Total revenue is not all Scotland's. As I've shown you all the Gas is England's for a start so that's a huge chunk of the 406bn total north sea revenue.

629 2018-11-19 22:46:30 This is a huge opportunity.. Does SA have the vision to grasp it? I sure hope so. This initiative could create tens of thousands of jobs, is environmentaly friendly and reduces SA's dependency on oil imports.
630 2018-11-19 22:46:20 Before I cook anything I always add oil or butter etc before seasoning, as it makes the food soak up all the flavor. I've never tried brining, but you can bet if you add oil or butter to it, it will be much better (then,of course, rub seasoned butter or oil onto food b4 cooking)

636 2018-11-19 22:46:04 Agreed. Not sure about Cali but I know DJT took land from the Federal gov’t control in Utah & gave control back to the state. Left side had a big problem with that bc they thought that  ppl would drill for oil on it. As far as I know that’s not happened and it’s been over a year
637 2018-11-19 22:46:04 Girl I felt that but ya they have shampoo/conditioner and anti fade oil for colored hair. I combine it with their Argan oil leave-in conditioner and their Shea butter dry deny gel oil. My curl pattern never went back to the way it was but if I moisturize everyday it’s still curly

640 2018-11-19 22:45:32 @PnPCBC   This panel is missing the point.  When oil was scarce it sold for $100+ per barrel.  Now there is an over-supply and prices are down.  Nothing to do with #pipelines ..its supply and demand.  Call them on it! #cdnpoli #bcpoli

647 2018-11-19 22:45:00 No, the oil market doesn't work that way. The government doesn't set prices, supply-demand fundamentals do. Think about it like cars. If Michigan hypothetically said we're selling all our cars for $150k then customers would just buy other cars. (and what do you tell the Big 3?)

667 2018-11-19 22:43:01 Great comments.  Give u credit for going to Edmonton. It's not one of the places on my bucket list.  I do appreciate sun belt hockey in the next few months.  It's already cold and I'm not ready for the oil bills yet.
668 2018-11-19 22:42:58 When you go in to get an oil change they said I should get my transmission fluid ... might as well do it
669 2018-11-19 22:42:53 Quebec is sitting on oil reserves that rival Alberta, they just don’t want to spend the money to get it to market, why would they when they are given 9 + MILLION a year!
670 2018-11-19 22:42:33 It should work small wonders for you. I have a few different applications - creams, balms, lotions, oil, etc.; all serve their purpose wonderfully.

672 2018-11-19 22:42:19 For the most part warming your car up is a myth. The only difference with cars and temperature is the oil n coolant you put in. there is oil designed for colder temperatures and some coolants are NOT anti-freeze. despite what you read on the label
673 2018-11-19 22:42:17 Prestituting...fixed it for you
674 2018-11-19 22:42:15 Hey bill why don’t we go 100% Renewable so your green friends are ok , shut down all Coal mining all oil imports, and destroy all cars and move back into caves, because that’s where you are heading
675 2018-11-19 22:42:14 ooh! i mean yeah i usually have olive oil instead  if anything but the place we go to is like...a fast food pizza place so it’s done in like 7 minutes,, so usually the pizza is rlly crispy

683 2018-11-19 22:41:31 Sounds about right! 

That's why I make my #MercuryRetrograde oil because 4x a year of this gets pretty annoying. 
684 2018-11-19 22:41:24 I’m tryna figure out why all these tweet about females not taking care of they cars, 60% of these niggas don’t know how to check they oil either

689 2018-11-19 22:40:53 Oils supposed to make things NOT STICK! SO WHY ARE MY CHICKEN FINGERS STICKING, OIL??
690 2018-11-19 22:40:48 Politicians always assume there are technical solutions to everything because they never have engineering or science degrees. Some snake oil company will have had a word and promised them a turn key solution to their frontier infrastructure paradigm and they'll have lapped it up.
691 2018-11-19 22:40:46 I love oil cleansing, it works so well. Just be careful with putting lemon on your face!!!
692 2018-11-19 22:40:44 I predict he will recommend shutting down all oil and gas production in Alberta.  LEAP MANIFESTO
693 2018-11-19 22:40:36 Especially in November when this oil decline is included. Interestingly strong nominal wage growth hasn't pushed up inflation.
694 2018-11-19 22:40:35 おはありぇす！！！☼
695 2018-11-19 22:40:33 While we're talking about palm oil, are we aware of the impact of MDMA on jungles???
696 2018-11-19 22:40:19 Chiarelli makes all these one for one deals because he doesn't have the brain space and time to acquire  market value returns for players because he's too damn consumed with looking after the Oil Kings. This half ass organization reeks incompetence and credibility. #Oilers
697 2018-11-19 22:40:18 Snake oil and pretend time. That's all this is.
Pretending it is a conspiracy from men that you cannot prove this crap is true is lame.

701 2018-11-19 22:39:56 peppermint oil extract has done more for my congestion than any of the meds i’ve taken all day
702 2018-11-19 22:39:39 Horse power, then oil, reduced massively the price of energy, and of goods. Did it change the fact we work ? it improved work safety, reduced working time, improved salaries and buying power, freed time for leisure&art, created new jobs, but we still work, and desire goods.
703 2018-11-19 22:39:38 had the worst headache at work yesterday so I put peppermint oil on my temples; later on decided to go tanning in the strongest bed at the salon & forgot about the oil being there & NOW I HAVE THE WORST SUNBURN IN MY LIFE ON MY TEMPLES.

707 2018-11-19 22:39:15 my brain runs on engine oil, i smell it
708 2018-11-19 22:39:12 I think i just overpaid for this oil change 
709 2018-11-19 22:38:58 Lol I’m doing the mission where you steal the oil wagon and I died the first time cus they shot the oil container or whatever but the second time I just got out of there so fast I didn’t even get a wanted notification and they didn’t chase me?
710 2018-11-19 22:38:46 And Norway didn't get 1tn from oil. It got 418bn it's high taxes allowed it to invest oil money.

Why are you blatantly ignoring the forking facts.
711 2018-11-19 22:38:42 So I've been trying black cumin seed oil for health purposes. It tastes like rotten food and I cannot get rid of its taste even after hours taking a spoonful of it.  Erch...   xP. #yucki

714 2018-11-19 22:38:26 To the Oracles at @PnPCBC & @PnPCBC , I wonder how much does 1 barrel of Hibernia oil sell for. Surely this is relevant to the ungoing discussion about Alberta crude. I'm an avid follower.  Please, don't disappoint me.
715 2018-11-19 22:38:21 The oil is not going to suddenly go bad. Maybe you got water or other volatiles in there, but you can get them out by running with ballast valve opened. And not making not down to 300 microns is not going to be an oil issue unless it was really marginal before.
716 2018-11-19 22:38:16 Literally how can they approve army recruitment adverts on the TV but still refuse to air the palm oil advert?!!!! Which one is more political here, it's a joke
717 2018-11-19 22:38:11 why did I randomly think about how I left my cuticle oil at home..

723 2018-11-19 22:37:35 Yes, if Ryan Zinke sells off all our federal and state lands for oil exploration we will live in a barren wasteland! No more fires!

725 2018-11-19 22:37:23 Live trees are surprisingly difficult to set on fire. They have a large percentage of water and that water being evaporated  literally cools things down and prevents the temps of reaching ignition point.
dried out wood can burn intensely depending upon its density and oil content
726 2018-11-19 22:37:20 He sounds like a guy who was sold snake oil. And realized now that the commitment isn’t there from the university or it’s gonna be more of an uphill battle.

728 2018-11-19 22:37:13 Iceland was finally looking like a regular shop. Apparently, vegans are not important enough to keep over Christmas.

Will palm oil also be making a comeback, just for the holiday season?

731 2018-11-19 22:36:44 It wasn't a question. And I wasn't rude, I simply replied. I already know they've committed to ending palm oil in own brand, hence my comment. You've told me twice now.

733 2018-11-19 22:35:58 Actually, that's not true and he's arguably been the Oilers best player for the past 3 to 4 weeks and that includes McDavid.

It's not #Alberta's #oil or #bitumen the moment it's out of the ground. Owners & buyers set the prices.
We could build refineries, but would have more cancer, & it'd be hard to compete with the huge US facilities.
Better to switch quickly to #AlternativeEnergy.
757 2018-11-19 22:33:30 All this is very interesting, though out of it, I can not definitively say what is true or not... Definitely food for thought... On the whole, I don't trust MBS more than the previous rulers... I hope we can get to a point where we don't need their oil or money!
758 2018-11-19 22:33:25 The government has made oil & coal a winner for a century. I don’t mind them giving green companies a boost given it will likely save the world or at the very least reduce our dependence on terror led countries in the Middle East
759 2018-11-19 22:33:24 Question 3 is who would the potential buyers be?  Would another oil company see an opportunity?
760 2018-11-19 22:33:14 Discussions have seemingly died down on the palm oil issue. It looks like the general public on social media have forgotten about the Iceland/greenpeace ad and moved on with their daily lives.
761 2018-11-19 22:33:13 When I fried up those mozerella sticks, I reignited the hot oil of war.
762 2018-11-19 22:33:10 RE is subsidised, oil isn't subsidised, it is taxed.  UK solar isn't efficient enough (yet?), DC is needed because a lot of energy is lost (20%?) transmitting AC over long distances, say across the Sahara to Europe.  Wine and music are all I need.

764 2018-11-19 22:32:55 One is wondering why the government have not celebrated the rapid increase in the global oil market price..They complained when it was $21 but afterwards they got it and yet the economy is still bad.
765 2018-11-19 22:32:35 A delicate glaze of olive oil, a little salt and pepper grilled over got mesquite to medium rare! I intended to take more pictures but once they were ready, it was all she wrote! I’ll be back

but I wish it would heal them too
775 2018-11-19 22:31:04 One of the reasons that the government s have not put the fuel duty up is the fact that they don't dare. If they did it would blow out of the water the argument that it's the oil company's making the money .

The watch it wouldn’t pass
So if you want to know the time just look up ......

806 2018-11-19 22:27:46 Oh dude that's why, 
 All fats consumed should be (if possible) in a food source, so avocado, lard as a cooking oil, butter not margarine, prime cuts of meat with good fat on it. Coconut oil is great too.

821 2018-11-19 22:25:36 Helma Croft is byfar the worst person ever to predict oil prices.

826 2018-11-19 22:25:03 $65 clearly important Support on Brent Oil Spot - been sold off a lot lately and must be due an attempt to move up. RSI 24 very low.
827 2018-11-19 22:25:01 I’ll hold palm oil. Will you hold samosa?
828 2018-11-19 22:24:57 Better use of international aid? You have managed to skip answering the following questions:
Why are oil subsidies but not renewables?
Why do you think the article states there is no value in solar panels?
Why do you think we need DC transmission tech?
Can I meet your dealer?
829 2018-11-19 22:24:51 ‘The oil from the pan started flaming and fleur nearly lost her afro’ can’t cope #imaceleb
830 2018-11-19 22:24:43 Well, if we're generously including AK as part of the West, I'll say the Midnight Oil podcast from Alaska's @AKEnergyDesk
831 2018-11-19 22:24:40 おはようございマンゴー
今日もがははは…です(^-^)
832 2018-11-19 22:24:38 hanging with this old dude in the firestone waiting for my oil change and we’re just shitting on hgtv couples
833 2018-11-19 22:24:11 Hey, Mr. Trump 15 Saudi's walk on some airplanes... Good thing they're on your unconstitutional terrorist/Muslim ban so something like that couldn't happen again... Or is oil thicker than your campaign promises?
834 2018-11-19 22:23:56 dipping bread in olive oil that I squeezed lemon juice in and becoming a God
835 2018-11-19 22:23:47 Hn isaac come here your car runs on vegetable oil
836 2018-11-19 22:23:38 who did it? who put the rainbow in the oil slick? who put the ghost in the cat’s eye? the shadow inside your heart. the dream inside the dream. the first kiss. the song that came already with memories, even the first time it was played for you.
837 2018-11-19 22:23:36 Dude tried to charge my uncle $90 for an oil change what the fuck 
838 2018-11-19 22:23:29 Also, use a Cool/Hot Mist Humidifier to help clear the mucus from your Bronchial tubes. I used to get Bronchitis, a lot, so this helped. You can always add essential oil’s or the eucalyptus to the humidifier. Okay, there’s my two cents. Hope that helps and that you feel better!
839 2018-11-19 22:23:08 Baba since is when oil an issue thief will everly remain ole.
840 2018-11-19 22:22:53 I have learned not to look anywhere but the sale tab  the only I want is like $120 or $149 with the matching wallet... I just went  on vacay and got my nails done bad my oil changed. I need to not. 
841 2018-11-19 22:22:51 Breaking! The Employer Group Dick to eat one of the fouled  sea-birds on Out Of The Fog tomorrow to show the little Sea Rose oil spill was entirely harmless.  
Lol.   #nlpoli
842 2018-11-19 22:22:36 I wish you could mute words on FB lmao I would have anything with “essential” and “oil” blocked real quick
843 2018-11-19 22:22:32 Worth noting that Donald J. Trump will be the final nail in the Grand Old Pedophiles/Gas & Oil Perverts party coffin.  

I look forward to a real 2nd party based on truly conservative ideas, not on racism, bigotry, fear, hate, pseudo religiosity, murder, gerrymandering, etc.
844 2018-11-19 22:22:23 Cleaned my face with coconut oil and now I can’t see
845 2018-11-19 22:22:23 One more reason for Trump to not care.  He's all guns & oil..
846 2018-11-19 22:22:13 Will you pay damages? because Oil Spillage comes with huge compensation
847 2018-11-19 22:22:06 Only thing I can think of is the Lucky Star branded motor oil but I'm pretty sure that's not what you're thinking of
848 2018-11-19 22:22:05 More money than oil and gas to line his pockets.
849 2018-11-19 22:21:46 Slice caps off Courgettes. Scoop out soft inner flesh. Set aside Courgette-casing caps, for later. Spray Olive Oil & Fry lean Minced-Beef lightly + sliced Red Onions, chopped Tomatoes, Bovril, chopped Open Mushrooms, fresh Peas,

852 2018-11-19 22:21:37 That CO2 is invisible and odorless is ... weirdly irrelevant. And developing countries will suffer the most from climate change. Not in 50 years: It's already started.
I thought you said we could find a technological solution, so coal & oil wouldn't be their only fuels. No?
853 2018-11-19 22:21:35 Your wrong, the US never did and they are still top of the league. Even without Scotland the UK would drop 1 place in GDP terms. Oil didn't make London, oil cushioned the blow from joining the REC that was about it..

And again NOT ALL THE FCUKING OIL WAS SCOTTISH
854 2018-11-19 22:21:30 I really want to wash my hair but when I think of that process, I just put some oil sheen in it and go about my business.
It’s clean though
855 2018-11-19 22:21:28 Domoda with oil is not domoda... give it another name
856 2018-11-19 22:21:17 I bet you everyone in the group chat was quiet cause they were googling, "What does an oil baron look like?"
857 2018-11-19 22:21:08 yea I’ve just been putting oil in my car I haven’t gotten that jaunt changed fr in like ... 8 months it says on my lil sticker
858 2018-11-19 22:21:02 She wants to build refineries that have no access to market....good strategy Notley. Does she actually think Albertans don't know the oil industry?
859 2018-11-19 22:20:59 Tell him a lot of snow and a little salt will create the perfect “hot oil” ice cold water.
860 2018-11-19 22:20:57 The morning workers didnt change the oil so we cant fry anything nice :)
861 2018-11-19 22:20:55 It suits you.
862 2018-11-19 22:20:55 So sorry. Black castor oil or wild growth around the edges may help?
863 2018-11-19 22:20:54 Pray for me with this next check tomorrow LOL gotta get an oil change BAD, a new vape, make the edc payment I missed a few days ago, plus gotta start saving for a house and my flight to Vegas  y’all someone who’s good at adulting dm me pls I’m dying
864 2018-11-19 22:20:50 Why are we selling oil at a loss, turn the value off like any farmer would in low prices and trim the fat.. build processing plants, or what the end consumer wants, don’t keep giving the oil away, if guys need to get laid off it will happen either way, get a littletiredofthewine
865 2018-11-19 22:20:39 Used a Lush hot oil hair treatment and fuckkk it's so nice and soft ;3; all ready for my hair cut tomorrow!
866 2018-11-19 22:20:35 Beard oil been working wonders on me
867 2018-11-19 22:20:34 3rd year in a row hosting thanksgiving! My menu consists of: Turkey with gravy, garlic mashed potatoes, chicken cutlets, lobster cheddar biscuits, white rice, Puerto rican beans (Pink beans with potatoes) Sauteed veggies in garlic & oil and empanadas!!! 
868 2018-11-19 22:20:32 What about Saudi oil and the risk of refining in the Bay Area. WE already know what the health risks are for journalists in Saudi and we know other human rights are a risky endeavor there. But the main point is the health risk if Saudi oil refined in the Bay Area.
869 2018-11-19 22:20:14 Use any oil safe for the face- jojoba, almond oil, hemp seed oil...
870 2018-11-19 22:19:59 Even National Iranian oil company is wholly state owned. They should figure out what makes those companies profitable instead of going down the privatisation route
871 2018-11-19 22:19:56 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
872 2018-11-19 22:19:53 #PDP is a den of men who are willing to dominate power and corruptly enrich themselves in the midst of mass penury, ecological disasters in #Oil producing areas and a general sense of despair and despondency and still behave with bravado and untoward aggressive exuberance.
873 2018-11-19 22:19:49 In a big picture, US and Saudis want a strong dollar/petrodollar...look for oil at $100/barrel soon. This will help MBS build his new Neom city and ensure dollar dominance. Fiat dollar is not sustainable, look to gold
874 2018-11-19 22:19:46 And yet, at the time of the Scottish Referendum, we were told the oil was running out.
875 2018-11-19 22:19:37 @DocThompsonShow @realBradStaggs Point of contention gents...I actually DO foresee an issue with working the Fryolator while sporting the large penis. Wouldn't you be afraid of it falling into the fryer when you put the fry basket down into the oil...  #OUCH #WhatILearnedToday
876 2018-11-19 22:19:04 but i dont have any olive oil
877 2018-11-19 22:19:03 @PnPCBC Cullen may be right in that french file might be frustrating Scheer. But boy if french , unity, and oil combined don't blow Trudeau's plans for campaign out of his canoe, don't know what will.
878 2018-11-19 22:19:00 Me: goes in for a $20 oil change 
Them: Ma’am we can’t do an oil change today but your tires have dry rot so $400 pls
879 2018-11-19 22:18:57 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
880 2018-11-19 22:18:46 use castor oil nigger 
881 2018-11-19 22:18:44 They can’t help it that they are sheep; they lack any true leadership and self worth so when a snake oil salesmen starts waving his arms around and speaking on a 6th grade level they can relate. #trumpsheep #sheepherder
882 2018-11-19 22:18:39 NEVER again will i bring my ass to walmart for an oil change. these people got me sooooo shitting!
883 2018-11-19 22:18:37 Only two oil producing countries in the world failed to setup a government oil fund similar to Norway.....The UK and Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Economic mismanagment of the highest order by Thatcher and successive UK gov's.
884 2018-11-19 22:18:36 Took us back? because more towns r  captured by BH?foreign reserve depleted?state cudnt get bail out funds,no massive infrastructure ongoing nationwide?Youths not empowered?Agriculture booming? 10M beneftn from HGF and barrel of cuddle oil still above $100..Yes it took us back!
885 2018-11-19 22:18:28 What pains me is that oil is now stable and still nothing to show for it on Nigeria citizens
886 2018-11-19 22:18:26 So you are hardly an impartial pusher of green tech, are you? The oil and gas business is far from dead, Alberta and others will separate before we allow more sabotage to our most vital industry.
887 2018-11-19 22:18:15 you prolly need oil don’t drive it
888 2018-11-19 22:18:08 INCORPORATE AN OIL INTO YOUR SKIN CARE REGIMENT. Jojoba oil is that gurl for me.
889 2018-11-19 22:18:02 はーい(^-^)/
890 2018-11-19 22:18:02 食パンさんおはよー！
891 2018-11-19 22:18:01 There is a lot of snake oil in the socioeconomic discourse. Most of it poisonous ...
892 2018-11-19 22:17:58 They are blaming Trump for the reaction of the people in Tijuana over at Buzzfeed.
893 2018-11-19 22:17:50 Considering the studies that show health benefits for reducing carbon emissions, and the studies that show the health benefits if we switched to electric cars..  I would see those points as a good thing, not a bad thing. We are still going to need oil if we go electric.
894 2018-11-19 22:17:46 nah i was getting ROASTED in the group chat about my tiny calves and the worst built nigga in the chat tried to jump in.

i told him he was built like every wild west oil baron ever and it got QUIET.

EVERYBODY CAN'T TELL EVERY JOKE.
895 2018-11-19 22:17:45 Most ethnically sourced oil in the world. Every other country is behind us. Fact. We find even more innovative ways to reduce CO2 in the production, no one else cares. Let's ship more oil from Saudi Arabia where their human rights records R virtually nil. Zero LGBTQ RIGHTS!
896 2018-11-19 22:17:42 What part of we will no longer pay for Defense, WM debt interest etc do you not get? We get to keep ALL the Oil revnue too! you know..that oil that seems to keep running out every time Scotland flexes her muscles! then there is OUR share of the Assets! ;)
897 2018-11-19 22:17:36 Someone in my neighborhood almost blew up their house making BHO and CBD oil. Over 100 tanks of butane were found. The house almost burned to the ground. 

Careful making shit inside your own house, that shit is dangerous even for professionals
898 2018-11-19 22:17:23 Isn’t David the one with the pool? (And olive oil?)
899 2018-11-19 22:17:22 We have many ways of making more than what our oil is giving despite going almost all over the world he still couldn't transform Nigeria in becoming top tourists attractions. Chaaaai clueless lifeless brainless aimless #BuhariMustfall
900 2018-11-19 22:17:16 Chef McElroy cut up some live rats, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a dictionary, along with grass.
901 2018-11-19 22:17:15 TGP Marula oil 
902 2018-11-19 22:17:13 I’m probably gonna charge $35-40 since I’m gonna use oil paints.
903 2018-11-19 22:17:08 This is more a permanent correction i believe. The regulatory environment makes it very difficult to invest in oil. Our political leaders have failed Albertans and Canada
904 2018-11-19 22:16:54 If i may add, SA needs three things to be truly sovereign: own currency, own food and own energy/oil. I think we have all 3 but not willing to utilize it in proper direction.
905 2018-11-19 22:16:47 guy who changed my oil said my car stank up the whole shop 
906 2018-11-19 22:16:45 Truth be told he met the state when oil was less than 30 dollars . But bros since December oil has risen steadily and by feb 2017 it climax in 80 dollars per barrel and still going up. Don't even use this as a reason for his mess up. Oil market is booming check online sir
907 2018-11-19 22:16:45 Two-sentence horror story!

It's going to be a hell of party, they told her, everyone is going to get baked or fried. She glanced down at her oil can; yes they were.
908 2018-11-19 22:16:43 غير صحيح .. الامن التركي لديه تسجيلات لمدد طويلة جدا قبل دخول #خاشقجي وبعد قتله رحمه الله.
909 2018-11-19 22:16:11 Oil is fav cuz I can add it to my honey lemon tea
910 2018-11-19 22:16:07 You got conned. You chose multiple times bankrupt snake oil salesman who got where he is by lying, cheating and stealing. I can't get too upset at the death of Gadaffi to be fair.
911 2018-11-19 22:16:05 Its definitely not good enough that you are in so much pain. You need to get on a better pain relief programme. You are a sole parent with a young son..Its absolutely Shameful. Have you thought of applying to get on cannabis oil programme?. Hope you feel painfree soon.

913 2018-11-19 22:15:47 That how come they can save their oil you stupid man
914 2018-11-19 22:15:36 Also with everyone freaking out about pink shadows staining, just check if it has Red40 in it or Carmine. Carmine is not vegan BUT it doesn't stain like Red40 does. Either way, use that oil based makeup remover and it'll come off!
915 2018-11-19 22:15:33 The worst fact I ever heard that ruined my life was that oil is made out of ancient sea life and not dinosaurs
916 2018-11-19 22:15:20 Yum! So you have to prep the tofu by itself, i dip it in like a seasoning-olive oil mix after I’ve drained it and then bake it before I add it to anything. There’s also a lot of sites that show you different ways to cook it, they’re really helpful:)
917 2018-11-19 22:15:13 Thanks @JacquiVLvT it was so good! I am thinking about doing the aromatherapy too - it’ll be so complimentary. I bought a bed and some oil this morning so I need guinea pigs now!
918 2018-11-19 22:15:13 Actually - I believe I'm a lot smarter than you.  There has never been a global conflict like you predict for oil, over oil, in the middle east or elsewhere.  Palestine V. Isreal - comes to mind, as a regional conflict, as is Saudi Arabia V. Yemen.

920 2018-11-19 22:14:49 The fact it isn’t held in a human rights nightmare monarchic oil pit puts the Nation’s Cup ahead
921 2018-11-19 22:14:49 I’m not a sucker. I don’t buy bridges from snake oil sales people.
922 2018-11-19 22:14:48 If I break your heart na Oil Spillage
923 2018-11-19 22:14:39 No luckily I’m long oil via $xom. Think it consolidates up for a good while. Also added highly levered oil play $crc today around $24. Sitting on bottom BB, need that to turn up
924 2018-11-19 22:14:29 She said that Russia’s proximity to Alaska was proof of her foreign policy experience. Fey’s line on SNL is actually soft-pedaling it.
925 2018-11-19 22:14:24 SO BASICALLY THE 3 TYCOONS HAVE KEPT US ENERGY DEPENDENT,  STOLEN SO MUCH MONEY THROUGH UNCONSTITUTIONAL INCOME TAX, AND DOMINATED OIL PRODUCTION...MAKING UP DEPENDENT SHEEPLE!! THEY ELEVATE THEIR AGENDA...AND SQUASH ANYONE WHO GETS IN THE WAY!!!
926 2018-11-19 22:14:17 Brian Topp has wanted to shut in Albertas Oilsands and keep the oil in the ground. Now as an adviser he is likely to recommend that in keep it there. He must be licking his chops to get going. Notley must really hate Albertans.
927 2018-11-19 22:14:15 The oil refinery across the Haven is quite pretty at night too.
928 2018-11-19 22:14:14 YEAH. Don't Have Recyling Either, So Corporate Nazi Elite, ,Wallstreet(FRAUD), Corporations(HOSTILE TAKOVERS) Imperial-Roman-Nazi-Psionist Mafia-Bankster-Cartel have Good Laugh. We Continue to Send TOXIC FOOD wrapped in PLASTIC GARBAGE SO EVERYONE CAN DROWN IN TOXIC SHIT AND OIL
929 2018-11-19 22:14:05 Getting frustrated so fast? Take some time and read what's posted above. Maybe some Balagulichyadi oil on your scalp will help. Talking out of your ass is what you are doing now.
930 2018-11-19 22:14:04 @CBCHomestretch question for Paul, can Alberta not just increase the price of oil to match WTI? Or just shy of the price?
931 2018-11-19 22:13:55 my Grandad used to call me olive oil ... and apparently I had Wednesday legs, whensday gonna snap or Thursday legs Thursday bend den day snap
932 2018-11-19 22:13:52 Hahahaha baby oil and they slide off xx
933 2018-11-19 22:13:46 You call it convenient, I call it smart and forward looking. Your oilsands has expanded for over 20yrs now. Realestate in and around Fort Mac no longer what it was. The expansion is over, oil will still be needed but not nearly in the quantities that it once was.
934 2018-11-19 22:13:34 NO ATTACKING BARRON!
Even though he is the offspring of a money-grubbing snake oil salesman and an evil gold-digging ex-porn model, he is innocent.

937 2018-11-19 22:13:19 If your eyes are stained from bright shadows, just use an oil based makeup remover- it'll break down that color easier than just face wash.  My fave is by @Clinique - the purple one works AMAZING
938 2018-11-19 22:13:19 +predict how you personally would react. would you blame a peanut butter company for someone having an allergic reaction to peanut butter? i'd like to think no, and that you'd find a way to ttreat it and move on. also in the other end if things, maybe try coconut oil to remove?+
939 2018-11-19 22:13:16 Dalton is a  resort desk clerk that likes Olive oil on their feta pizza with green tea
940 2018-11-19 22:13:14 why don't you fund it ?!
don't you think if it were easy and cheap to do, it wouldn't have already been done ?!
US shale oil is soooo much cheaper, do some reading and stop the ridiculous soros conspiracies. makes you look like a knucklehead.
941 2018-11-19 22:13:13 Because otherwise the gold will flow to where it buys more. If a Eurasian trading bloc raises (for example) the current gold/oil ratio from 40 barrels an ounce to 100 or 500, gold will very quickly migrate to the market where it buys more.
942 2018-11-19 22:13:05 That’s why there are a lot of nervous people even with the Democratic Party falling for the snake oil the #GOP is spewing about #NancyPelosi
943 2018-11-19 22:13:00 Skinny Banton - Old Oil - Skinny Banton (Grn 2013) @SkinnyBanton1
944 2018-11-19 22:12:53 he has no issue with his head coach...lack of talent is biggest issue in Edm...
945 2018-11-19 22:12:46 It also has  some of the highest taxes in Europe, that's the reason it can invest it's oil. $500bn/5m people against 500bn/65m people.

See the flaw in your argument. It's right there.
946 2018-11-19 22:12:45 Deriving our chemicals and raw materials from natural sources like kelp can be just as damaging as deriving them from oil. Mining, growing, dredging or rendering animals can't safely replace petroleum. We're pretty fucked. Too much growth, too many people. Glad I'm old.

949 2018-11-19 22:12:24 Unku Unku....I hail thee more! 
Reader & Readee....sure you know Oil Wells are also Drilled. Just saying 
950 2018-11-19 22:12:19 Can’t dispute the shot glasses. But not sure where you got the barrel figure. There is 205 litres in a Canadian barrel of oil. This would compute to 1220 barrels of oil for 250,000 litres.
951 2018-11-19 22:12:19 I pressed it a little bit and then coated it in corn starch w garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pep, and then sprayed it with olive oil and put it in the oven for like 20 minutes and added spicy sweet chili sauce!
952 2018-11-19 22:12:13 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
953 2018-11-19 22:12:11 Congratulations to Brock Cook; he scored a CDB Oil themed gift bag from Higher Education in Charlottesville and Richmond in today's 4:20 IQ Test!  

According to a survey, 25% of parents have one of these, what is it?  

Answer:  A favorite child!

956 2018-11-19 22:12:04 Wash really well before bathing, bathe with baby oil after clipping. Make sure the blades are sharp and blade oil.
957 2018-11-19 22:12:02 No probs.  There are many different types of vitamin B, I take fish oil, vitamins C, D and B12 a fair bit, but B3 niacin specifically helps with healthy hair & prevents hair loss.
958 2018-11-19 22:11:57 Oh we had time for a full game of Monopoly in our house in the 70s power cuts. Didn't even have time to get the oil lamp warmed up.
959 2018-11-19 22:11:33 @CadburyUK As Christmas approaches what are your thoughts about sustainable palm oil targets in your products?
960 2018-11-19 22:11:24 I started with some special type of chocolate mousse, then I switched to 50-70ml glasses of safflower oil (I believe), which was horrible. I only did it because of my rare medical condition, I’ve been on a more regular diet for the past few years.
961 2018-11-19 22:11:19 Through all the conversation I’m surprised no one has asked where McDavid is .. if he likes TM & PC its all a mute point
962 2018-11-19 22:11:15 But why do you make bread with palm oil?! The only option I found was the part-cooked French Baguettes: mind somewhat boggled...
963 2018-11-19 22:11:13 I always blame the oil change technicians for using up all my gas. It makes sense to me. Lol
964 2018-11-19 22:10:54 After a 10 hour day at work, I'm now stuck sitting in an auto shop getting my oil changed.

967 2018-11-19 22:10:42 She’s greasing the wheels for a run at the federal level - Topp is a heavy hitter in the leap manifesto party - Topp has no intention of delivering results.  All for show to dupe swing voters that they actual care about the oil industry.
968 2018-11-19 22:10:31 Nick took my car to Jiffy Lube for an oil change, which is nice and all, but they rearranged everything in my car to vacuum and overinflated my tires 
969 2018-11-19 22:10:30 Coconut oil every morning on your nails and cuticles. Keeps them strong  & less likely from breaking, hope this helps.
970 2018-11-19 22:10:23 How, exactly, do you think oil companies get "built"? Do you think there isn't a lot of robbing and stealing involved? Do you think the state just hangs back and lets the "invisible hand of the free market" work its magic? Do you imagine this isn't a thoroughly corrupt process?
971 2018-11-19 22:10:23 that will definitely do it to you! my volkswagen cost me a fortune on oil changes!
972 2018-11-19 22:10:11 Mine used to cost me $20!!!! I miss cheep oil changes
973 2018-11-19 22:10:10 RT @LivingSafely: #Pringles Cheddar Cheese this November? With less than 2% actual Cheddar Cheese, it has more salt, oil or MSG!
974 2018-11-19 22:10:03 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
975 2018-11-19 22:09:58 The most efficient oil company in the world today is SAUDI ARAMCO, a state monopoly. For many years in recent past the most profitable company in Asia is the Malaysian oil monopoly - PETRONAS. All are 100% owned by the govts. NNPC is not owned by the Niger Deltans but Nigerians
976 2018-11-19 22:09:54 Yes please! Thanks for the recommendation! Also grabbed some cans of Neck Oil for the train back to Derby!
977 2018-11-19 22:09:50 me: i did my part of the group project [holds up a crayon drawing]
group member: here's mine, hope i didn't mess up too much! [holds up absolute masterpiece oil painting]
me: cool
978 2018-11-19 22:09:41 サッカーのアジアカップってUAEでやるらしいけどoil moneyで審判買収してたりするのかな
今そういうの厳しくなったし大丈夫かな
979 2018-11-19 22:09:24 Really wish someone would’ve told me it takes Walmart 4 hours to do an oil change
980 2018-11-19 22:09:24 I super have to do my painting hw but i dont want to cuz its cold and that means i cant snuggle in a blanket unless i want to get oil paint all over it
981 2018-11-19 22:09:20 Getting my oil changed now i jus need to get some new tires 
982 2018-11-19 22:09:13 You do understand that the money for the new science building can from Big Oil and NOT the MUN budget, right?

And have you looked up who contributed to the Battery project?

In other words, economist, do u research before tweeting?

986 2018-11-19 22:09:01 Damn OIL CORRUPTS everyone!  Sorry to hear that, Of course the TRUMP ADMINISTRATION is promoting Oil, wants to SHUT THE EPA DOWN, I’d heard from a Canadian friend that Trudeau is not perfect but no one has it worse than the youth in the US (Of the developed nations)
987 2018-11-19 22:08:58 Apparently coconut oil is good for your hair, didn’t have any so put coconut oil body lotion on it instead, lets see how that goes
988 2018-11-19 22:08:43 Getting my oil changed and there is DEFINITELY no heat on up in this thang.
989 2018-11-19 22:08:21 Nigerians should be sceptical about this man and his cohorts. They’re going to share our oil wells among themselves! No way.
990 2018-11-19 22:08:12 @PnPCBC  For all these sorry politicians dirty tar sands oil which nobody wants, is more important than the planet's survival. Scientists be damned  because Alberta can't survive without oil. Dumb.
991 2018-11-19 22:07:53 Notley is the clear and present danger she is off the wall appointing Topp who has done nothing but help destroy the western oil sector Time to take to the streets and toss her out. No time to be polite passive Canadian sheep Stand up for your province
992 2018-11-19 22:07:49 Curious to see if Koskinen gets in the net for the rest of November. Talbot could get on of the last two at home but wouldn't count on it. #Oilers
993 2018-11-19 22:07:47 Smacks of crisco made from cotton seed oil. And you know how nutritious that is.
994 2018-11-19 22:07:40 watching old people watch Ellen DeGeneres dance while waiting in the oil change shop lobby makes me uncomfortable
995 2018-11-19 22:07:36 Love gas and oil.  You must file and ask for sanctions for phony lawsuits
996 2018-11-19 22:07:32 会話しなきゃいけないのが耐えられないからあんまりすきくない 髪の毛いじられるのは好きなんだけど
997 2018-11-19 22:07:30 So they have now till early April to pull a rabbit out of their hats, and Christmas is coming.  So what magical thing can an anti oil person do to promote energy that anyone will believe?
998 2018-11-19 22:07:28 Bro, we cannot sit and watch Atiku ruin us. We cannot sit and watch Atiku sell and buy Nigeria! We have seen what he did with the 5 multi-purpose oil and gas cargo terminals he concessioned to himself-Intel.
999 2018-11-19 22:07:18 食パンさん、おはよーございます！
1000 2018-11-19 22:07:07 FYI, without oil and gas deposits Texas would be Oklahoma without the charm. A dusty backwater. Just saying....

1003 2018-11-19 22:06:50 Trump is a train wreck. One that was carrying nuclear fuel, coal, diesel oil and frozen McDonald's burgers.
1004 2018-11-19 22:06:43 eat some oil!
1005 2018-11-19 22:06:40 We need to stop tolerating these violent far left groups. I'm done watching the squeaky wheel get the oil.
1006 2018-11-19 22:06:28 would love for the true frustrated fans to boycott the team for a game or two and see how fast that gets a reaction.  nothing like hitting them in the pocket book to get their attention.  not much i can do from Calgary other than suffer from all the flame fan laughter.  :(
1007 2018-11-19 22:06:26 Production and consumption wastes take second place in environmental pollution after accidents in oil pipelines. Collection, neutralisation, extraction and disposal of waste is an actual problem. FutureEnergy project offers a solution to this problem that also brings you profit!
1008 2018-11-19 22:06:06 Norway banked much of the proceeds in a Oil fund aka a government owned soverign wealth fund now worth over £1tr . That wealth fund returned £131bn in extra gov revenue in 2017 alone.
1009 2018-11-19 22:06:05 Watch them suggest this now. However, if something like that happens there will be riots in the streets
1010 2018-11-19 22:05:50 Would be nice if there was this concern regarding the oil and gas industry crisis we are facing in Canada, but I guess that’s western Canada so it doesn’t matter ?
1011 2018-11-19 22:05:39 It really doesn't at the moment, just went with the oil change!
1012 2018-11-19 22:05:31 Question, what’s the % of our GDP is export oil?
1013 2018-11-19 22:05:23 Long story short of the car search everyone tried to fuck me nd the last 2 had horrible rust on the bottom Nd the other had a huge oil leak. So with that being said I’m buying at 2008 Silverado. And a 1997 Miata  then in 2020 I’m copping a brand new never driven 86. Fuck frs
1014 2018-11-19 22:05:16 Secretary of Pennsylvania is promise you: we should be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be flowing into the normal.
1015 2018-11-19 22:05:15 @beardbrand I ran out of  oil  time to restock! 
1016 2018-11-19 22:05:15 so our oil is pish?
1017 2018-11-19 22:05:02 Try Punkin Butt teething oil!!! Jay was literally in soooo much agony this past week & as soon as I rubbed some on his gums he was a whole other baby!! I highly recommend!
1018 2018-11-19 22:04:29 100%, and i'd say that some of those choices were made for us by the system writ large without our input. why is fossil fuel so cheap? why does Big Oil lobby the govt? why do people need to consume newer better cars every few years?
1019 2018-11-19 22:04:14 Seems some people are just in the train of cows of PMB.
That America is the number ONE IN oil producer in the world  is because they sold out the oil sector to private individuals who can manage it better.

Is it the government that is financing it over there?
1020 2018-11-19 22:04:08 It's shite being Scottish! All these other places like Norway have the right type of oil and we have been saddled with the wrong type, thanks Westminster for helping us out with our problem.
1021 2018-11-19 22:04:02 Yes they do, as for oil Norway produce about twice as much oil as the UK and is half the price to extract add to the fact its basically nationalised which is the exception rather than the rule.
1022 2018-11-19 22:04:01 The U.K. and Norway both began offshore exploration and production in the mid-1960s with the first oil discoveries made in 1969 with the UK producing 3 billion BoE more than Norway.
1023 2018-11-19 22:04:00 My oil change was suppose to be free but the guy charged me for it . I’m not bold enough to tell him it’s supposed to be free sooo.... I called my mom lol
1024 2018-11-19 22:03:58 Now watching #promisedland movie. Movie about fight of farmers, environmentalist against Oil and natural gas company's land acquisition guy who invokes greediness among farmers to sell their lands.
1025 2018-11-19 22:03:55 @PattyAmaka Your  lips are smoother than oil.
1026 2018-11-19 22:03:49 1. Higher electrification may lead to oil demand peaking by 2030, but any reduction in emissions from the likes of electric vehicles will be offset by the increased use of power plants to charge them, according to the International Energy Agency’s annual World Energy Outlook.
1027 2018-11-19 22:03:39 I hear you Gregor but don't understand the mindset of some people. Yes they're frustrated but come on.
1028 2018-11-19 22:03:32 And also, people should be moral. Yes, we (collectively) gave FB a free pass/didn't notice they had become the oil barons AND the leadership of company seemed to keep treating this like a college project w/no adult responsibility.

Man if he were available and Tony had room...you better believe he would be burning the midnight oil to get him into a ride.
1032 2018-11-19 22:03:09 And yet so many STILL think it was a good trade.
1033 2018-11-19 22:03:07 Your party met the infrastructures that were dead and could not revitalise it for 16,years pdp held sway, do you know how much oil was in those 16 years? You can't give what you don't have with your get Nigeria working again No oooooo
1034 2018-11-19 22:02:59 Girls will be quick to judge you on your knowledge on cosmetics but don't even know what type of oil their car takes 
1035 2018-11-19 22:02:58 If the US stops stealing Syrian oil whilst pretending to fight ISIS they might stand a better chance. Return the stolen Golan Heights too.
1036 2018-11-19 22:02:56 I’ve become olbas oil dependent 
1037 2018-11-19 22:02:54 So if I repeated the title of the P.J. O'Rourke book, "Parliament of Whores" (US Congress) I wonder if that will get me in trouble?
1038 2018-11-19 22:02:41 And how can u reduce your debt when all u sell as a country is oil which u don't even have a say in it's pricing?  And when oil price fell ridiculously, how can u improve infrastructure without borrowing? He even tried to have doubled our external reserve.
1039 2018-11-19 22:02:39 You need fuel oil to generate electricity unless you use solar energy or wind energy. The whole idea to reduce oil price sonit can be cheap
1040 2018-11-19 22:02:31 And thats the difference between making and missing the playoffs. 35 more points whether goals or assists turn 2-1 losses in to loser points and or wins.  Oilers gonna oil...
1041 2018-11-19 22:02:15 someone take my car for an oil change cause I really don’t have the energy 
1042 2018-11-19 22:02:10 Right. “Peppered kale with olive oil and lemon. Roasted fish with olive oil and some salt. Side salad with beets and pickled parsnips” like ok I’m just coming to talk tbh 
1043 2018-11-19 22:02:06 I would just like to say Alberta oil is 14$ a barrel right now. crazy freemarket amiright 
1044 2018-11-19 22:01:45 Kristen, every unemployed oil worker in Canada could be working today if there was a real commitment to renewable energy.
1045 2018-11-19 22:01:23 おはよ～
1046 2018-11-19 22:01:17 I'd begin by fuelling and checking the oil in the woodchipper.
1047 2018-11-19 22:01:11 Listen Scott and Bob @ScottMorrisonMP @RealBobKatter support @KevinHoganMP in fuel Royal Commission.  It’s win win for you. We are drowning under oil companies and retailers greed as well as Govts continued application of a tax on a tax with the excise of 48c then gst 10% on top
1048 2018-11-19 22:01:10 don't fret about one listener...I was quick to point out that is a bad strategy.
1049 2018-11-19 22:01:09 They can't beat them out so just open the door and let them leave. Oil, Minerals, Pipelines etc. Easy pickings.
They tried everything else. This is it.
1050 2018-11-19 22:01:04 Getting my oil changed and these men keep staring at my car like “wtf you doing girl” cuz yes my car is a mess and yes I was suppose to get my oil changed 1000 miles ago. I’ve been busy Kay?!
1051 2018-11-19 22:01:00 @McVities You use palm oil in your products. While I love them I'd rather not have another bite of the things you produce. You've lost a customer, and a fair more too as I alerted them to this on Facebook.
1052 2018-11-19 22:00:50 How can we ensure this type of oil spill doesn't happen again, three words - use common sense. #nlpoli
1053 2018-11-19 22:00:47 Like the $20 BILLION in US taxpayer dollars shunted 

to the oil & gas industry?

Yeah, those subsidies don't seem very "free market" to me either.
1054 2018-11-19 22:00:45 November 19, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

1060 2018-11-19 22:00:19 I take those two plus fish oil cuz it’s supposed to be good.. i feel no difference.. lol then again I’m always stoned so that may have something to do with it 
1061 2018-11-19 22:00:15 Apparently it's somewhat common for magnetic drain plugs to break/get stuck in M3 oil pans. 

Like warnings on condoms, they should put that on the box.
1062 2018-11-19 22:00:07 Except for the fact that Bush helped his family get out of the US right after 9/11 when no one else could fly- Bush and Bin laden were business partners in oil. OBL was nearly 7Ft tall in a country average was 5'5" and he was getting dialysis -he was protected - #DeepState
1063 2018-11-19 22:00:05 Can you guess the name of the healthiest fat on the planet? If you have guessed “Extra Virgin Olive Oil,” you are right! Since the oil contains monounsaturated fats, it can help lower cholesterol and control insulin levels.
1064 2018-11-19 22:00:04 Ok so coconut oil works for me in the cold weather and Shea butter works in the warm weather this is annoying 
1065 2018-11-19 22:00:02 Don’t get angry.

1067 2018-11-19 22:00:01 You also wrongly assume that all the oil would be Scotland's. Far from it. The division would follow the rough trajectory of the border that goes from S. West to N. East.

Meaning a lot of the oil from the 70s would fall on the English side.
1068 2018-11-19 22:00:01 I bet @Floyd9375 will be delighted to find out that I answered a phone call from the call center/robocall scumbags at something called "Healthcare Simplified" because Drum Oil's number and name appeared on my caller ID.
1069 2018-11-19 21:59:47 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
1070 2018-11-19 21:59:25 Eggs and oil!
1071 2018-11-19 21:59:14 When oil starts its uptrend again.

1075 2018-11-19 21:58:58 Also, today at work (which I went in for a few hours on my day off),  a customer came in with """"research"""" about hemp vs cbd oil that she got off a random .com website and was upset when all of us, who are educated in at least the bare minimums, corrected her.
1076 2018-11-19 21:58:57 Has sis ever heard of coconut oil
1077 2018-11-19 21:58:47 I would be willing to bet it's well passed its 3000 mile oil change too. That just ain't right.
1078 2018-11-19 21:58:45 It would be, but Thatcher sold off the blocks to the private sector, negated to form a state run oil company and a sovereign wealth fund from the profits.
The treasury get tax and duty, when they're not subsidising the companies that pay every other country!
1079 2018-11-19 21:58:15 So his life is spared by our court system, simply because he pled guilty?  Where’s the Justice?  Left his children submerged in an oil tanker after smothering them? Killed his wife who was pregnant with their third child? Can’t get much worse than that.
1080 2018-11-19 21:58:05 She, the Alberta Premier, said quote" I want to raise it to $40 a barrel". WTF? So what the hell is it now? A few years ago it was under $8. Shocking eh? BTW the world price for the lowest grade oil is at minimum $60 a b. Are Canadians suckers and complacent morons?

1083 2018-11-19 21:57:40 So glad for you. I've been seizure free for a few years, now, taking lamictal. Finally found the right one. But like you, I'm still fighting them off. Can't wait to have a good 6 wks off to try the CBD oil. I hear good things.
1084 2018-11-19 21:57:32 I was last there after the Brer Oil Disaster in the 90s. I had so many weird synchronicities that week, I'll never forget it. Basically, we brought a storm and a high tide with us that dispersed the oil. We left with no oil on the beaches! The locals called us angels. Strange!
1085 2018-11-19 21:57:32 Godspeed to the warriors out here fighting for their right to *checks notes* rub oil on a virtual fourteen year olds titties
1086 2018-11-19 21:57:18 I would follow it up with the fact that most major cities are run by Democrats.  34 of the 50 largest in the US are run by Dems compared to the 13 run by Republicans.
1087 2018-11-19 21:57:17 Fried green tomatoes. In panko or something similar.

Chop in quarter, egg, flour, egg again than panko. Fried in oil of your choice. Served with sour cream.
1088 2018-11-19 21:57:15 I mean, it's rude that I have to wait to get mine changed at the oil change place because there are other people here.
1089 2018-11-19 21:56:58 I think I need to start wearing goggles whenever I fry anything, oil hurts the eyes

1094 2018-11-19 21:56:17 Dude, you literally have no idea what you are talking about. There is no way renewables (other than oil & gas) will ever provide enough reliable energy to drive our economy. JUST ISN’T GONNA HAPPEN.
1095 2018-11-19 21:56:16 Drilling in north pole for oil in such extreme environment and climate proves humans can move anywhere for money, if we replicate this on Mars we can then create the motivation to build a civilization there #Mars #SpaceX

1098 2018-11-19 21:55:43 @3HL1045 You think it was tough on you guys. I took the Misses to Indy for the weekend and had to watch that game live. Felt like I had been kicked in the Twitty Balls walking out of Lucas Oil Stadium.

1104 2018-11-19 21:55:04 The rhetoric around Facebook in the wake of the New York Times piece has gotten red hot.

1115 2018-11-19 21:53:16 I'm not picky.  Anything with potatoes and salt cooked in oil is acceptable to me really.  If you want to add in other seasonings, go for it, but they really are not necessary.
1116 2018-11-19 21:53:09 デスリ、むちゃくちゃ演りたい
1117 2018-11-19 21:53:07 I think that @realDonaldTrump is also undermining them by giving waivers left, right and centre for countries doing deals with terror state Iran for its oil. Is the President going to get into bed with the Mullahs like everyone else? That is the big danger.
1118 2018-11-19 21:53:03 Source? I don't doubt you, I just want to know where this one came from.

1121 2018-11-19 21:52:54 or should I say the city of London was bankrolled and built using the proceeds of Scottish North Sea oil. much of England, like Scotland, Wales and NI saw nowt other than deIndustrialisation .

1137 2018-11-19 21:51:06 Total revenue from oil was 408bn over 50yrs. That's 8.5bn a year and not all that would be in Scotland's waters.

Last year the industry was 500million negative.

1168 2018-11-19 21:47:51 Palm oil is an outsized problem, rainforests relied on for worldwide oxygenation are being burned as fast as a California wildfire, it’s not a “vegan” issue, it’s a “human life on earth” issue.
1169 2018-11-19 21:47:35 $130 was only 3 yrs ago, the oilsands investment world had long been invested at that point. There is only one 1 one reason for a price drop of a commodity. #oversupply The same reason it can't get back above $80. I've traded the oil market for 20 yrs.
1170 2018-11-19 21:47:30 People are calling for lower on SPY but for that to occur Fang needs to continue to crash . Because oil, metals, banks, are already so beat up its silly

1177 2018-11-19 21:46:43 The impression was so accurate it took something truthful and turned it into a national joke.

Great example youve got going.

1184 2018-11-19 21:46:16 here´s a recipe for you... drop dirty palm oil.
1185 2018-11-19 21:46:12 One thing to note is Canadian investment dollars are flying out the country in the last 24 months. Part of that is carbon taxes and increased (impossible)  regulatory environment that stops new oil infrastructure
1186 2018-11-19 21:46:09 I’m thinking abt drinking some castor oil but I’m scared lol
1187 2018-11-19 21:46:08 3. Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the pot and then add pork. Stir for about 5 minutes, add 1 tsp salt. Turn off heat.
1188 2018-11-19 21:46:06 Finally had time to get this oil change
1189 2018-11-19 21:46:05 I would love to see the moochers accepting transfer payments, say no, we don’t want your money. I want you to walk everywhere, no planes, & give up the 1000s of products made from it. Then preach human rights while loading up on oil from Saudi Arabia. #Dumb

1192 2018-11-19 21:45:40 For Christ sake, a guy on @JasonGregor just said they need to trade Leon for a D-man and build from the backend out...was nothing learned from the last time this approach was taken? 
1193 2018-11-19 21:45:38 Yes, so also the external reserve is more than twice what PMB met. With lean external reserve, a country is limited in its international trade. In the face of the exctutiating fall in revenue as a result of the fall in oil price, it makes sense to borrow than deplete reserve
1194 2018-11-19 21:45:16 I came for an oil change... now I need a new battery 
1195 2018-11-19 21:45:11 The soot issue is more of an environmental problem connected to crude oil exploration, there’s little he can do. It’s like blaming, Ogonis for their bad environment
1196 2018-11-19 21:45:05 Oil is on the way out and folks who work in oil have some time to change
1197 2018-11-19 21:44:59 I just spent $200 on an oil change & a full tank of gas  I took my husband for granted I never pay for this type of stuff 
1198 2018-11-19 21:44:53 a oil change will make u feel like u whippin a whole new car
1199 2018-11-19 21:44:43 You love to hit me up when you need something....

Well, I need 4 new tires and an oil change. How much you puttin' in?
1200 2018-11-19 21:44:40 2. In separate pot or Dutch oven (recommend a non-stick kind), heat 1 tablespoon of oil over a medium hot flame. Toss in onions and cook until they are translucent. Add tomatoes and stir for 1 minute, then add garlic. Stir for about 4-5 minutes. Pour the vegetables into a blender

1. I don’t have to make that appointment to get my oil changed that I was putting off

1207 2018-11-19 21:44:13 Like I said, my mistake. Which does prove that some impressions are so deadly accurate they replace real life in your head. That said, it is clear that Palin was a fool, and will always be one. Obama made that mistake about 57 states, but no one can call him a fool.
1208 2018-11-19 21:44:11 Can you explain why you are opposing a Select Committee for a Green New Deal? Could it be that you have a direct conflict of interest? The residents of New Jersey should note that you have received $178,000 from PACs of oil, gas, and electric utility companies. @FrankPallone
1209 2018-11-19 21:44:11 Bunch of loons. Where do they think their gas and oil comes from? It won't hurt the land. We used to climb up gas lines on our dirtbikes back in the 70s. Some of these people aren't even from WV. Just a bunch of liberal nuts.

1230 2018-11-19 21:42:12 They’re crap. You have to hold them, understandably, but they are limp and soggy. Too much oil, not enough heat.
1231 2018-11-19 21:42:07 Matter of choice really (for both employees & employers) . I used to work very briefly in upstream oil & gas operation, some companies like Schlumberger insisted on hiring females. Others like my employer (Weatherford international) had de facto ban on hiring females.

1236 2018-11-19 21:41:36 Goes to get an oil change:

Me on the inside: This'll probably be $40-$60, okay

Car place: Sir, your car needs 
1) a new air filter
2) a new oil filter
3) a new belt
4) there may be transmission problems

That'll be hundreds of dollars, and honestly, you may just need a new car
1237 2018-11-19 21:41:26 Just a quick reminder heading into #Thanksgiving: don’t pour your cooking oil, grease or other fats down the drain—it could clog your pipes.

1305 2018-11-19 21:36:21 Suppose when the Oilers won the McLottery, all our rivals got together and formulated a plan to thwart the Oil from turning into a juggernaut.

But, they needed to make sure it wasn’t *obvious* that it was sabotage.

Could they have done better than what Peter Chiarelli has done?
1306 2018-11-19 21:36:19 It's the shetlands oil and they have stated they want to remain in the UK.

1307 2018-11-19 21:36:01 BBC reporting that 1 field in the West of Shetland has 7,000,000,000 barrels of oil. That's 460,000,000,000 or 92,000 pounds per person in Scotland. That's from 1 field. Haven't even started on Clyde or the North Channel.

1348 2018-11-19 21:31:32 Because socialism would have stopped wood, coal, oil, and gas usage immediately, of course. 

I don't know what Harry Turtledove alternate universe they think they're living in but...
1349 2018-11-19 21:31:27 Is cbd just snake oil 2.0? I’ve ingested lethal amounts and feel nothing
1350 2018-11-19 21:31:10 Des excités ce soir sur l’autoroute !!! Agressif et conduisant de gros 4x4 diesel et des pick-ups !!!! Cherchez l’erreur ! Ça leur pose des problèmes le prix du gaz oil ? Je ne crois pas !!!!
1351 2018-11-19 21:30:57 Unchecked socialism leads to neg. consequences & unchecked capitalism leads to plutocracy, neither’s good for democracy. How do we protect us? Acknowledging both greedy left (gov. waste, unions,etc) & greedy right (oil corps &churches, etc) there’re credible fears on both sides.
1352 2018-11-19 21:30:54 What's the saying, "The fish rots from the head?"  IMO, you can fire Chiarelli (which should happen) and you can fire McLellan (should happen), but as long as Lowe, MacT, Howson, and even W. Gretzky to a lesser extent, continue to have direct input, nothing changes in Oil Country
1353 2018-11-19 21:30:44 This looks great. How ‘bout we spray the razor wire with olive oil? Just in case they get adventurous?
1354 2018-11-19 21:30:43 Lavender oil or peppermint oil ,Mix a few drops with a carrier oil, such as warmed coconut or sweet almond oil, and apply directly to the outside of the throat.Start with 1 or 2 drops before increasing the dose. to help prevent adverse skin reactions,such as rashes or itching.
1355 2018-11-19 21:30:40 The problem with the oil price differential in Alberta is pipe lines that are not being built and should be  but it is the Liberal government not taking any action that is causing this problem.

1366 2018-11-19 21:29:18 13 leagues to your 6, 13 FA cups to your 8. One Champions League win Via Oil money doesn’t change that
1367 2018-11-19 21:29:17 had a guy i used to talk to snap me saying “get you a man like this” with his hand covered in oil from working, and my reply was “i had a man like that until he left me for his ex so i’m good” 
1368 2018-11-19 21:29:10 canada has something BETTER than oil. canada has nuclear, hydro, wind and solar electricity. it's all much cleaner and cheaper than either tar sands and saudi oil. give incentives for canadians to purchase ELECTRIC VEHICLES POWERED BY 100% CANADIAN ELECTRICITY.
1369 2018-11-19 21:28:54 And there it is, the oil interests conspiracy. If you think oil interests (1) care enough about a niche car manufacturer or (2) aren’t already hedged with investments in alternative energy, then you’re more disconnected with reality than I thought $TSLA
1370 2018-11-19 21:28:54 I'm so very sorry! I was in Little Rock in 89 doing oil title work, having breakfast w/ co worked when Good Morin Arkansas came on
1371 2018-11-19 21:28:50 Grape seed oil is my best friend
1372 2018-11-19 21:28:42 He only does that when oil and housing prices crash.
1373 2018-11-19 21:28:39 United Steelworkers union locals representing 30,000 U.S. oil refinery and chemical plant workers ratified terms for contract proposals in negotiations that are to start in January. The proposals include an 8 % pay increase for each year of a three-year agreement.
1374 2018-11-19 21:28:38 @Richzeoli @GREGSTOCKER Zeolis code word should be "OIL" which would freeze everyone's brain. Does he mean peanut or 10W30?
1375 2018-11-19 21:28:28 Someone just walked past me at PHL arrivals wearing enough patchouli oil to cause an ecological disaster. I would have murdered them but I was too busy praying for the recovery of everyone that was on their flight.

1379 2018-11-19 21:27:59 When you go for an oil change & they tell you it’s like 100 things wrong with your car  I jus need an oil change. That’s it 
1380 2018-11-19 21:27:53 Currently eating @PROPERCORN microwave popcorn. It's palm oil free!! And it tastes maybe better than the other stuff. #snax
1381 2018-11-19 21:27:50 Def filing property damage form for that pothole that gave me an oil leak
1382 2018-11-19 21:27:48 I know a ton of QCers that commute & are tired of high gas prices.

Selling AB oil at a sharp discount hurts all Canadians. Massive US & Saudi supply increases aren't helping either. Trump, Putin & Crowned Prince Bonesaw really control the price of oil & they'll keep it that way.
1383 2018-11-19 21:27:46 So because everything can only be bad now, oil likely rallies from supply constraints put on by the Saudis, causing the fed to remain hawkish.
1384 2018-11-19 21:27:46 Turkey’s trade with Saudi Arabia is not really that big so trade sanctions will hurt Turkey only a little. Turks buy most of their oil and natural gas from Iran&Russia

1387 2018-11-19 21:27:44 Where can I buy food with extra palm oil goodness?
1388 2018-11-19 21:27:03 (well, just a bit dirty cheating by improving position by increasing oil price, helping it's comparative advantage vis-a-vis EU/China who need to import more energy).
1389 2018-11-19 21:26:55 No"oil is not oil" you cumgargling halfwit. Bitumen does not have anywhere near the explosive properties of Bakken shale oil and refineries are specifically equipped for specific grades of oil
1390 2018-11-19 21:26:44 This isn't constant in time, though. The oil crash of the 80s really hurt Texas a lot. The more recent one, not so much.

water, sunflower oil, rice vinegar, parmesan, Dijon mustard (water, vinegar, mustard seed, salt, white wine, pectin, citric acid, tartaric acid, sugar, spice), garlic powder, fresh thyme, guar gum, xanthan gum"

So where is the tomato in the dressing?
1398 2018-11-19 21:25:55 Try castor oil. Very effective.
1399 2018-11-19 21:25:52 I did, it doesn't to the extent you might think unless you're prepared to increase the forestry budget by billions and have a 365 day program dedicated to it. Not to mention the trees in Cali are often eucalypts, high in oil which burn from the canopy, rather than the floor
1400 2018-11-19 21:25:48 I wouldn't actually let you do the shopping (With a message line) as imo you are nothing better than a snake oil salesman. You told everyone that we would have countries begging to deals with us - that wasn't the truth. And you don't know why 17 million people voted you buffoon
1401 2018-11-19 21:25:32 Thank you  cooking skills, however, do not lol. Gave myself quite bad burns pouring hot oil over my hand - I was trying to roast veggies  xx

1404 2018-11-19 21:25:02 For cleansing: I dealt with cystic acne and tried ALLLLL the natural stuff. Finally tried @younglivingeo’s purification + carrier oil & cleared it up in 1 wk!!  so I cleanse with @DrBronner peppermint soap, and use the oils as my moisturizer. It’s been a game changer.
1405 2018-11-19 21:24:53 Amaziah was his hand against the blessing for this thing unto her, which he went up without the oil have they told Saul,
1406 2018-11-19 21:24:34 I feel like child riding with sam to get her oil change

1409 2018-11-19 21:24:17 Someone please tell me why my work forced me to spend an hour watching a video on how to deal with oil fires when I work for an accounting firm? We’re not even allowed toasters???
1410 2018-11-19 21:24:12 Get something oil based (that you know you’re not sensitive too) and go over your eyes again, it will get majority of staining off. 
But with literally every red pink purple shadow from every brand, it’s gonna stain.
1411 2018-11-19 21:24:01 No pipeline proposed would replace Saudi oil. Only one refinery in Canada buys Saudi oil. The Irving refinery in St John NB and they have clearly stated they have no intention of stopping.

If you honestly care about this issue go shame Irving not "Quebec"
1412 2018-11-19 21:23:57 My car keeps leaking oil but my dad is in Atlanta and idk what to do about it so ima keep driving it lmao

Oil revenues are still miniscule, the White paper predicted £10Bn.

?
1416 2018-11-19 21:23:30 Coconut oil massages >>>>
1417 2018-11-19 21:23:28 Damn, will these tots also be served with olive oil upon request?
1418 2018-11-19 21:23:26 I just wish I had somebody to oil my hair and rub their fingers through my scalp 
1419 2018-11-19 21:23:25 Epigenetics is about living a lifestyle that combines your intentions with your genetics.

You might have genetic benefits from eating monounsaturated fat. So eat some macadamia nuts.

Don't like nuts? Eat some avocados.

Don't like avocados? Cook with olive oil
1420 2018-11-19 21:23:18 Right! I totally am not doing “dirty keto” where it’s just bacon and hot dogs lol that can’t be good for anyone. More veggies, olive oil, butter, avocados yummm 
1421 2018-11-19 21:23:02 We have gelcaps of Oregano Oil so you don't have to taste it!! :)
1422 2018-11-19 21:23:01 Why the hell should we be selling oil for 12 bucks when market value is 70? There's still a strong demand for oil (you're living proof as you're using oil based products right now). Is it to feel good?
1423 2018-11-19 21:22:58 hot toddies! or teas with echinacea. and oil of lavender/eucalyptus 
1424 2018-11-19 21:22:57 Almond oil with a little bit of castor oil and some drops of rose water (to keep the smell nicer!) - the almond oil is rich in vitamins and the castor oil makes hair grow. also do you get enough vitamins?:)
1425 2018-11-19 21:22:45 Economics and politics are like oil and water which should never be mixed under any circumstances!
1426 2018-11-19 21:22:41 Khashoggi's case in which oil is mixed with Jamal's blood is today’s the real test of the values of the superpowers that have recognized the principles of universal human rights.
1427 2018-11-19 21:22:34 I like how if this were any were else in the world the world should send in peace keepers or task force but we dount have oil so deserve it
1428 2018-11-19 21:22:30 We have gelcaps of Oregano Oil so you don't have to taste it!! :)
1429 2018-11-19 21:22:29 Went to Vegas to visit my uncle. He decided to fry the turkey. Overflowed the pot with oil almost set the patio on fire and got his dog covered in fryer oil..all before we even sat down for dinner. Could cut the tension with the turkey knife. Won $500 at the Wynn bjack table tho
1430 2018-11-19 21:22:21 Garlic oil is the best 
1431 2018-11-19 21:22:17 Because you are pro 2A and he sold out to the left.
1432 2018-11-19 21:22:07 PMB led govt blocked free and illegal monies in oil & gas, but opened free monies in some other ways for another set of thieves.
This coming elections in. 2019 is actually about two (2) groups/sets of thieves and the rest of us caught in the middle.
1433 2018-11-19 21:22:07 Lolz....true jang newspaper is also good when u put french fries on it..oil goes away quickly.
1434 2018-11-19 21:22:04 I’ve been waiting at the dealership for two hours. I’m just getting an oil change. Please send snacks.
1435 2018-11-19 21:22:03 Their website also says they’re not vegan because of milk contact I’m so sorry  (I thought they were vegan too, oops!) Sustainable palm oil is totally fine! But Oreo are HORRENDOUS. M&S, Waitrose, Fox’s and Walkers all use certified palm oil 
1436 2018-11-19 21:21:58 Des excités ce soir sur l’autoroute !!! Agressif et conduisant de gros 4x4 diesel et des pick-ups !!!! Cherchez l’erreur ! Ça leur pose des problèmes le prix du gaz oil ? Je ne crois pas !!!!
1437 2018-11-19 21:21:56 it’s either gonna be something super expensive like a $200 facial cream or it’ll be a $7 jar of coconut oil haha
1438 2018-11-19 21:21:36 Lucky South Dakota? The oil boom is a classic resource-based economic model that will eventually bust, leaving behind a lot of empty trailers.

1441 2018-11-19 21:21:00 Thanks to the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale, the Lone Star State isn’t just the top U.S. oil and gas producer, but also one of the top producers in the world.

1445 2018-11-19 21:20:43 May I ask do you use rosehip oil every day/night?
1446 2018-11-19 21:20:37 Did they use Elisha's oil to fry it?
1447 2018-11-19 21:20:37 You guys are always shameless in celebrating mediocrity. 

Okowa with all the oil revenue to Delta state is commissioning 2 roads and that calls for celebration?  Really? 

Exactly why Nigerians don't take the story of your repentance seriously.
1448 2018-11-19 21:20:34 They told us oil was running out. What happened after vote? 
1449 2018-11-19 21:20:20 Geez who buys this snake oil I can’t believe these are our fellow country men and women!
1450 2018-11-19 21:20:16 @Richzeoli @GREGSTOCKER maybe Rich can instruct them on how to fill the pot all the way to the top with peanut oil. 
1451 2018-11-19 21:20:06 When was it a party? When Albertans had good incomes? Do you realize how many hours are put in for the good incomes along with the moments in life that are missed. Sure oil won't hit 100/barrel. Let's start selling Ontario's cars for 20% and tell Ontario to retrain.
1452 2018-11-19 21:20:03 TX is an interesting case of a natural resources state that has done an okay job at avoiding the natural resources curse. When oil tanks it hurts the state rather badly, but does not knock the state down completely. Tech (Austin) and Medicine (TMC Houston) are just a start.
1453 2018-11-19 21:20:03 Hi there, Have you been back to the location you had your car serviced at yet? It's possible your oil sensor was not reset. Let us know.
1454 2018-11-19 21:19:57 Really, it's just realistic pragmatism. We need crude oil. We need to address climate change. We need the economic growth of crude oil. We need to prevent economic disaster of climate change. Any person against oil is wrong. Any person against addressing climate change, is wrong.
1455 2018-11-19 21:19:56 these guys are a real scam.. they even dont have a proper ticker and they claim to be the token of oil and gas industry. there is only one #EGEM @ETHERGEMCOIN

1460 2018-11-19 21:19:46 How many units do we have? Will it be enough to cater fr the numbers that were dislodged? Bn a while I've left Zaria.
1461 2018-11-19 21:19:39 They never did find those "WMDs" either which was the pretext to invasion of a sovereign nation with huge oil reserves.

1466 2018-11-19 21:19:12 I presume some wifi snake oil sales guys sold it to the train manufacturers
And they're too embarrassed to remove it
1467 2018-11-19 21:19:10 No pipelines because hauling oil by train is much safer as demonstrated by all the train derailments and besides, the left have invested heavy in railways & they need to boost those earnings on stocks.
1468 2018-11-19 21:19:09 #boycottalbertaoil #boycotttarsands - the least efficient and dirtiest form of oil extraction must end, either we can do it or the market will do it for us. one way or another this will happen taking alberta's stakeholder naysayers kicking and screaming with it
1469 2018-11-19 21:18:58 Just as the @Tzeporah flap begins to fade, Premier Notley appoints Brian Topp as "special envoy" to investigate how to fix the US/CDN oil price gap (hint - build the pipelines).

1471 2018-11-19 21:18:42 ONLY A MAN WOULD ASK THIS QUESTION. He pleaded on TV it was a kidnapping, he had a girlfriend & gay relations, shoved the girls' bodies down an 8 INCH tube into oil tanks. The wife was pregnant. Evidence shows Shanann was killed slowly & Celeste fought back.
1472 2018-11-19 21:18:18 With 42% & rising unemployed adults, even the Green New Deal- with stopping all wars for money, drugs& oil as we bring those people home- will at best equalize that- so solutions beyond unions & "make do" work need to be used.
1473 2018-11-19 21:18:14 Take my work van to get an oil change and after going several places and them pulling it in and out of the bay, they tell me the battery tested bad. Ok?

1477 2018-11-19 21:17:40 I did notice that in the ingredients but decided to keep it as a small victory for the week anyway  do you know of any that don’t have palm oil?!
1478 2018-11-19 21:17:39 I'm not denying all media is biased in some way. I agree with you there honestly. But Sean is on the same level with Alex Jones and Rush Limbaugh. They are all chicken little snake oil salesmen. Alex Jones literally is a snake oil salesmen. And nothing Sean predicts ever happens
1479 2018-11-19 21:17:37 need someone’s daughter to oil my scalp 
1480 2018-11-19 21:17:35 When you don’t know how to change your own cars oil so you hit up your little cousin to do it for you . Did they teach you this yet in mechanic school @papamazen

1482 2018-11-19 21:17:08 Sure. It is done frequently with thin, low float, low cap stocks. With $TSLA all it takes is several well-capitalized trading accounts coordinating at right times. It is an easy matter for all the oil interests to fund this forever with a small portion of their profits.
1483 2018-11-19 21:16:53 Hahaha. I’m game for most of your content. Also, be sure to rake your leaves before dropping your turkey into the oil

1489 2018-11-19 21:16:12 made the most flavoursome juicy chicken breast for dinner today it was so good,,,
Marinated it in miso paste, sesame oil, garlic, ginger with a little water to bring the marinade together for about two hours then pan fried and rested under foil for 10 minutes 

1490 2018-11-19 21:16:11 How are coconut oil and water the cure for everything?
1491 2018-11-19 21:16:09 総合商社が、原籍・背番号制を維持している限り、日の当たらない部署から退職者が続発することはやむを得ないと思う。
1492 2018-11-19 21:16:03 This is a type of person that needs to get what he dished out. Put him in a 55 gallon drum 3/4 filled w oil, his hands and feet bound, and hold him under the surface until the bubbles stop. Then cover/seal 4 disposal.
1493 2018-11-19 21:15:58 I would be less worried about the future if we'd elected Grocery List / Bottle Of Oil
1494 2018-11-19 21:15:52 They really know how to capture the true smell in an oil.
1495 2018-11-19 21:15:49 Pretty volatile situation for Coach Q to consider, even with 97 dangling as the carrot. I don't think you bring in a new coach with the existing GM anyway.  This Cali road trip will be telling though. Somehow the Oil are still in it in their div, thanks to weak play by others.
1496 2018-11-19 21:15:39 I also have not seen a "status quo"... Europe has never accepted the USD centric system where it was sending overseas value and mopped up excess reserves from system as as biggest energy importer being vulnerable to oil shocks. Neither China nor Japan do support the system for
1497 2018-11-19 21:15:32 It’s $90 to get my oil changed wtfffffffffffff bitch
1498 2018-11-19 21:15:29 As do I. But ocean still polluted by ag and fed oil exploration in Ca.
1499 2018-11-19 21:15:28 But but but! It's not my fault. Its Ottawa and the provincial NDP. Nenshi and accountability are like Oil and Water...
1500 2018-11-19 21:15:20 Governments are traditionally pretty good at creating hospitals, medicine, educational institutions, transportation networks, weapons of mass murder, and oil wells. Feel like we could probably get them to do some more if we wanted.
1501 2018-11-19 21:15:17 @KFC_UKI_Help Are the new fries cooked in peanut oil? Was told by someone with a nut allergy to stay away
1502 2018-11-19 21:15:00 Holiday tip # 8:     
Driving? Winterize your vehicle and have a mechanic check the following items on your car:   
Antifreeze levels|Battery and ignition system|Fuel and air filters|Heater and defroster|Lights and flashing hazard lights|Oil|Windshield wipers|Thermostat|Tires htt
1503 2018-11-19 21:15:00 Put drops of eucalyptus oil in hot water, inhale steam to ease airways. Grate/crush ginger, collect juice, add a spoonful of honey to make a syrup, take every couple of hours. Soothing toddy:  stir 2 spoons of honey into glass of hot milk then add 2 spoons of whisky.
1504 2018-11-19 21:14:57 I wonder how many tankers every day.
1505 2018-11-19 21:14:54 Sorry to hear about your chemo Drew. Wish @CR_UK would stop using chemo and investigate cannabis oil. But I digress....

Hope you get your gift soon gav x
1506 2018-11-19 21:14:49 Just gave myself a back rub with Eucalyptus oil. It be like that sometimes.
1507 2018-11-19 21:14:49 My OGa Started  using  total oil since  when I was 10 yrs old
and we re still  using  it 100% we deserve  some accolade @Total

Allah zaba mana mafi alhairi
1510 2018-11-19 21:14:33 Why do you guys keep blaming the NDP for the price of oil??? You do realize that the price tanked before they were even elected. Why don’t you ever ask the conservatives where all the money went? Historically oil has always been volatile hence the diversification!!
1511 2018-11-19 21:14:28 MSNBC & CNN should stop giving #45 so much press! Yes he's an  asshole we all know that. Instead we should have daily coverage of the  Oil Wars. Television ended the Vietnam war. If everyone had to see what  takes place in the Oil Wars daily we'd end the them pronto.
1512 2018-11-19 21:14:22 I just bought an oil diffuser. 

who am I
1513 2018-11-19 21:13:57 Oil money
1514 2018-11-19 21:13:56 Jiffy Lube is really playing Dreaming of You rn. I’m not tryna cry while I’m waiting for an oil change 
1515 2018-11-19 21:13:54 Facial sauna, breathe in the steam. Add a drop of eucalyptus oil if your nose is blocked.
1516 2018-11-19 21:13:51 Can someone ask what happened with the last two panels? One also on oil and the other on natural gas. @GregClark4AB
1517 2018-11-19 21:13:33 For three years Notley did nothing but hire ppl to bury the oil industry-why now?doubtful she can pick anyone useful with trust and experience-give us a Christmas Present and call the vote for Boxing Day
1518 2018-11-19 21:13:31 Oil tankers and pipelines all spill eventually.
1519 2018-11-19 21:13:18 Really? So market was pricing in 2mn barrels of Iranian oil waivers when it was shooting up?
1520 2018-11-19 21:13:11 I recently had the dreaded 'there's palm oil in Nutella, you shouldn't really be eating it' talk with my kids...
1521 2018-11-19 21:13:10 Guy forget this is the first time I'll be against you buhari is going back home come 2019
1522 2018-11-19 21:13:10 He has no capacity for truth, facts, or science. He will do nothing but continue regulation rollbacks because he only supports big oil, steel, and other mining of metals and minerals. That’s probably where he gets some of his money. Dirty businesses like the ones just mentioned.
1523 2018-11-19 21:13:06 LOVE my dealership. I came in for an oil change & tire rotation & he said it was probably gonna be 2 hours. I was pissed & was throwing attitude. He just came up to me & said “your car is getting washed,I personallly went back there to help them so your car would be done faster”
1524 2018-11-19 21:13:04 I had a little look earlier, and intrigued by the beard oil 
1525 2018-11-19 21:13:03 neutrogena oil free with spf. it does me and my sensitive combination skin SO right
1526 2018-11-19 21:13:02 Aw shitttt should I just use almond and coconut oil? I have dry scalp
1527 2018-11-19 21:13:01 I wouldn't bet against you! Heat pumps may be particularly attractive for rural residents heating with propane or oil, more so than EVs in the nearer term. Provincewide gains, no disproportionate burdens == political winner.

1530 2018-11-19 21:12:44 I disagree, I had to do the Ketogenic diet for quite a while for my medical condition, all the fat and oil was very sickening and probably made me gain some weight
1531 2018-11-19 21:12:41 I need to get an essential oil. Right now I’m using the massage oil and the smell disappears faster. The store I usually go to was sold out
1532 2018-11-19 21:12:33 End burning things, and generate solar ,wind, and wave clean energy! That also stops the growing corruption of oil rich causing so much disruption all over the globe! Genocide and hiding behind white nationalism or Nazism all to keep up their status quo!
1533 2018-11-19 21:12:33 It is rude for other people to be getting their oil changed at 3pm.
1534 2018-11-19 21:12:26 While asking @USCG to conduct further research on Great Lakes oil cleanups is a good step, Enbridge's aging #Line5 pipeline is too great a risk to #GreatLakes…
1535 2018-11-19 21:12:22 Maybe if you were not a climate denier, more people would listen to you. I tend to agree with you, but there is still a problem with GHG emissions from the oil sands industry; improve the emissions and more support will emerge - #climatechange #sciencematters
1536 2018-11-19 21:12:16 My uncle has this house smelling like weed and weeks old used cooking oil
1537 2018-11-19 21:12:10 How cool is your job! I'm honored they get to hang out there. [Re, the cookies, not sure if vegan is the goal, but they do spread less with butter, it's mostly the coconut oil that seems to be proving persnickety.]
1538 2018-11-19 21:12:02 2018 Rooks County tax revenues show decrease from 2017 and oil values and tax are up. See a complete breakdown in this week's Sentinel.
1539 2018-11-19 21:12:00 Add also oil, grease and shake 30 seconds.
Let those wipes dry few minutes, add water and shake again.
This way you can actually see what happens in the pipes with so called "flushable" wipes and how fatbergs are formed.
1540 2018-11-19 21:11:52 Thanks! I do this periodically between oil changes already. It's good advice.
1541 2018-11-19 21:11:52 3 tweets and you refused to talk about Sanwoolu but keep talking about Buhari... Obviously, Buhari didn't bargain for the govt he took over.. Oil price slump alone was enough to quench any enthusiasm he had... He was the architect of some of his problem too..
1542 2018-11-19 21:11:46 I call ur tweet misleading, patties are baked, has vegetable or protein and nowhere the salt content of pizza, pizza is dough, cheese and tomato sauce, far more sodium and oil. Very little protein.
1543 2018-11-19 21:11:34 Update: We were denied standing to intervene in Hilcorp's proposal to double drill. The #NM oil conservation commission is now considering Hilcorp's proposal. #nmpol
1544 2018-11-19 21:11:04 What bribe? Maybe Texas should've offered smarter Texans, bigger tax incentives or both. O'Rourke was at least wise enough to understand this, but "real Texans" gave Cruz a 2nd term and ruined the state's future. Best of luck when the oil industry declines!
1545 2018-11-19 21:11:04 Putting olive oil on my dogs food like MERCI BARKOO
1546 2018-11-19 21:11:03 Oh wait it’s jamaican black castor oil 
1547 2018-11-19 21:11:03 Let me expand; Quebec won't allow a pipeline to go through their province to replace Saudi oil being processed in the east. Besides, environmentalists heavily protested the Line 9 Reversal. Why is it being considered a good thing now?
1548 2018-11-19 21:10:50 Hi Finland, Norway calling. We also had forrest fires this year, like the Swedes. Tried to put them out with some oil we had at hand, but I guess those excellent Finnish rakes would make the trick. Have some spare ones? Asking for a #Covfefe #rakenews #RakeAmericaGreatAgain

1555 2018-11-19 21:09:50 A man that lied about bone spurs, and whose father PAID OFF THE DR. when it was time to FIGHT for his country= is a COWARD.  So, to say he has respect for the miitary, is simply a "Kellyanne Alternative FACT"
Trump has NO RESPECT 4 our Country, PERIOD. He betting on Saudi's OIL
1556 2018-11-19 21:09:48 And olive oil
1557 2018-11-19 21:09:41 I think people get confused between the idea of socialism and totalitarianism.  Regulating a countries wealth so that the benefit can be equally distributed is not a bad idea.  See Norway’s oil and gas program.  Pure socialism at work.

1560 2018-11-19 21:09:17 In one hand @TheDemocrats are looking for native and Indian votes and in the other hand they want to stop their ability to make a buck by restricting industries such as oil development. Can't have it both ways @TheDemocrats. Vote RED. Vote for jobs and self determination.
1561 2018-11-19 21:09:15 John barrowman’s dick smells like the inside of Oli Benton’s butt oil.
1562 2018-11-19 21:08:58 I think we should go with the measurement that is most relatable and offers people a good visualization of how much oil was spilled. So, shot glasses.
1563 2018-11-19 21:08:48 Yes #TLW are drowning in debt as is #ENQUEST #Pmo and #nostrum 
Wouldn’t touch any of them with a 200ft barge pole
The last 3 oil crashes taught me that 
1) cash is king 
2) survival of the fittest (best run cos)
3)oil companies with major debt tend to be farked by bond holders
1564 2018-11-19 21:08:47 I was meaning that they speak about something they just talked about the night before. How many more times you wanna hear this?
1565 2018-11-19 21:08:37 Tillerson was a big oil warmonger.

Nikki Haley was a dumb MILF warmonger.

Reince-O Priebus was the posterchild for the GOPe, a political group just as hellbent on destroying Trump as the DNC. 

Kushner was an obvious subversive, and I mean painfully obvious...

1570 2018-11-19 21:07:32 @GREGSTOCKER @Richzeoli so let me get this straight. A guy who can't put oil in his FN car, is deep frying turkeys?

1592 2018-11-19 21:05:12 and to added to my comment, PC is to blame for the players and lack of progression this team has done since he started.  TM is stubborn and to me looks desperate and should be. i just hope PC doesn't get too desperate and make this worse with another 1 for 1 trade disaster.

1598 2018-11-19 21:04:16 In fairness to Trump, any WH has to deal carefully with KSA as a spat hurts the US more. This WH just lack so many of the traditional traits of decency and a moral high ground, showing again the snake oil seller family shouldn’t be in the WH to begin with - they’re compromised.
1599 2018-11-19 21:04:12 Apparently it’s cos they lurve us and want us to lead not leave. Bollocks to that I say, it’s our oil, whisky, renewables, water and a handy place for Trident and to dump their rusting nuclear subs.   It’s time the rest of the U.K. stood on its own two feet.

1604 2018-11-19 21:03:41 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
1605 2018-11-19 21:03:36 My three week old grandson is very proud of the work his father, uncle and grandfather do working in the oil sands, the most ethical and highest environmental standards in the world. #oilsandsproud
1606 2018-11-19 21:03:34 Good thought. I try to avoid time-sensitive stuff like blogs and focused on published work. But this might be a good opportunity to interact. Maybe I'll burn the midnight oil tonight.
1607 2018-11-19 21:03:34 He seems qualified, except for any basic knowledge of the oil and gas industry in general or upgrading and refining in particular.
1608 2018-11-19 21:03:33 I am taller than KAI... I guess that peaches helps you grow better than curry and chili oil...
1609 2018-11-19 21:03:26 #NationalTrust #climatechange
#disinvestment Why does NT have £30 million invested in oil, gas and mining? Disinvest now or we disinvest in the NT!
1610 2018-11-19 21:03:26 That was US shale oil not Canadian bitumen but nice job trying to exploit an unrelated tragedy to push your narrative. Real classy
1611 2018-11-19 21:03:25 Oil industry calling for a slowdown in production of Alberta... does she know better?
1612 2018-11-19 21:02:55 I use peppermint essential oil for pain relief but also love the smell of it and slather it on when I work out. But your girl Alanis hates the smell of it. Every time she catches a whiff of it, she scowls or makes a resting bitch face . So you two have something in common.
1613 2018-11-19 21:02:52 deadass using extra virgin olive oil as my moisturizer has SAVED my skin 
1614 2018-11-19 21:02:38 I *love* watching people oil paint because that blending looks *wonderful* and I want that blendiness but at the same time...I do multiple layers of paint sometimes because I also don't plan, and I don't know how to layer with wet on wet.....
1615 2018-11-19 21:02:34 Could have been lot worse if flames would have played 60. Our overall speed and quickness is strictly #hindtit. #Oilers That's the part of recent demotions I don't like. We sent out speed and quickness when it's two of the things most lacking.
1616 2018-11-19 21:02:25 I am a holder of #GKP and I like what it’s doing and how it’s being run! If they take on 500 million+ worth of debt I’ll dump them faster than you can say “Todd Kozzel”! The problem with being an over leveraged E&P is that if the oil drops, You’ll be bent over by bond holders!
1617 2018-11-19 21:02:00 damn oil change was $85  tf
1618 2018-11-19 21:01:55 Keystone actually goes to refineries that want the oil so not sure what you are on about anymore.
1619 2018-11-19 21:01:44 News flash, oil prices are not going to recover till Canada builds pipelines. So no need to worry about giving her credit, she doesn’t deserve any from what I have seen.
1620 2018-11-19 21:01:40 Simply rub corn oil into the entire skin....there is enough salt in the birds flesh to season itself.....Also I love to throw plums in the bird and pan...when done it’s got its own sauce
1621 2018-11-19 21:01:25 Win Jan canola down A$3.34/t & EU rape down A$1.43. Losses limited by drop in A$ against C$ & euro. Oilseeds under pressure as political tensions between China & the US rise again. Crude oil also lower. African swine fever in China cutting their pig herd & reducing soymeal use.
1622 2018-11-19 21:01:25 All of IBD stock are red today.
30% of them took new low.
Oil and JNK keep struggling around bottom?
1623 2018-11-19 21:01:21 Update: actually being a responsible adult and getting my car oil changed
1624 2018-11-19 21:01:08 Deli Mojo Pork Sub on flatbread, with oil & vinegar, spicy mustard, hummus, and double meat
1625 2018-11-19 21:01:03 Why The hate? It's just a digital commoditie i can stop buying oil because it's in 20 bucks The barrels i just buy more 
1626 2018-11-19 21:00:58 I just spent a 100 on a oil change Moe 
1627 2018-11-19 21:00:54 There was no enemy, their plan was to create a false flag, secure oil, and a perpetual war for the American arms industry. They achieved all three.
1628 2018-11-19 21:00:49 Well Jesus, here it comes b’ys, largest oil spill in NL history. #nlpoli
1629 2018-11-19 21:00:37 Nigeria is one of the richest countries in Africa because of oil, why are so many of them in South Africa??  Iam not xenophobic bt why??
1630 2018-11-19 21:00:32 Oh, I'm sorry did the Irving's suddenly grow a conscience? Nope. 

There is  no capacity for anymore heavy oil in eastern Canada. 

If you care about Saudi oil and this whole campaign isn't just an opaque lie to push for an export pipeline you should lobby Irving not us.
1631 2018-11-19 21:00:30  
1632 2018-11-19 21:00:29 Yes, tickets also available at Lucas Oil Stadium on game day.
1633 2018-11-19 21:00:28 Sugar and palm oil ? Why you would want to destroy your body and the Creation (25000 hectares of tropical forest cut by Mondelez the past 2 years) with these gross fake "cookies" ?

Please give me money!
1636 2018-11-19 21:00:21 If you're going to fry food try using olive or sunflower oil. They are known to store antioxidants in them which make it better for you than other oils.
1637 2018-11-19 21:00:15 Ey yo as a person who oil paints you can make it go real quick if you're cool working wet on wet. Smeary and wonderful~
1638 2018-11-19 21:00:12 I share that frustration but there is a new QC govt in place that will put jobs & eco growth front and centre. Opposition to pipelines was a convenient pre-text to increase value of hydro in QC; some see oil & gas opportunities for QC & clearly for Canada as a whole. Massive $s
1639 2018-11-19 21:00:10 Finally got my oil changed, can I get a round of applause
1640 2018-11-19 21:00:00 Natural pain relievers like arnica and CBD oil can help those looking to manage chronic pain without the use of opioids.
1641 2018-11-19 20:59:48 cisco is vegetable oil when you're
1642 2018-11-19 20:59:46 My “give up”was clearly sarcasm. You talked as if yours was factual. Never mind! “Crisis”. In 50 years? From an invisible odorless gas... that’s a “crisis” for elites who don’t know what Third World poverty looks like. Coal and oil are their only fuels out of poverty.
1643 2018-11-19 20:59:46 I'm updating my story on the oil price differential. UCP house leader @JasonNixonAB scrummed with media before QP, and said he's offended by the appointment of Brian Topp. Nixon says Topp "is not the guy" to fight for Alberta. More to come on that. #ableg
1644 2018-11-19 20:59:38 The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned a Russian-born South African  citizen Monday, alleging the man helped North Korea evade sanctions to  purchase oil.
1645 2018-11-19 20:59:27 Saudi Arabia will diversify its national income by investing in various fields and hopefully by 2030 no more dependence on oil as lone source
1646 2018-11-19 20:59:20 2 and half hour wait to get this damn oil changed 
1647 2018-11-19 20:59:18 @CarolineHirons For years I've been told that dehydrated skin will over produce oil, so you can combat oiliness with hydration. But apparently this is a myth. I come seeking your superior knowledge. Can you clarify this? 
1648 2018-11-19 20:59:05 It stained my lids a bit when I was just removing it with the wipes but I always go in with an oil after and it came right off.
1649 2018-11-19 20:58:51 Someone sent me a propaganda piece circulating about how politicians stole $1trillion of oil revenue in 16 years under PDP until Buhari came and changed the entire country in 3 years. You scoff at how unbelievable it is, but 97% of Nigerians will believe it. Lesson in there.
1650 2018-11-19 20:58:40 no matter the question, tea tree oil is the answer
1651 2018-11-19 20:58:38 its not an effort issue.  they've looked good this year at times.  even Saturday they looked good and shit the bed in the third. why?  what changes did TM do to change the game?  why did he insist on Lucic with top line after game settled down?  that's on TM and his assts, not PC
1652 2018-11-19 20:58:32 THAT WIG STIFF like clean it for once, I can see a few cum stains from last Tuesday doll, coconut oil works best
1653 2018-11-19 20:58:28 Saudi Arabia just makes money on people’s religions, and selling oil, desert rats who become kings now can not rule over the world but just being a mere puppets of rulers. This is what arabs now, mere puppets worn with wars killing themselves in syria, iraq, oman etc 
1654 2018-11-19 20:58:20 UPDATE: The wind was northwest 45 knots. Seas were 8.4 metres when Husky Energy attempted to resume production on the SeaRose FPSO, and oil spill occurred last Friday morning: @CNLOPB #nlpoli #cdnpoli @CBCNL
1655 2018-11-19 20:58:17 I watched TV news this weekend looking for mention of this huge oil leaking in canadian maritime ocean 
Not a word ! Completely silenced ?
1656 2018-11-19 20:58:08 I would love to try oil painting but also I am basically The World's Most Impatient Artist and no way I could let a canvas sit for days to dry without messing with it
1657 2018-11-19 20:57:54 @realDonaldTrump In these months, you finish the Iranian oil and stand up against the financiers, or your popularity will also decrease.
1658 2018-11-19 20:57:49 No I'm referring to EE and you know it. Especially since the line 9 reversal there is zero desire for more heavy oil in the east, And anything else that gets shipped out there will be exported.
1659 2018-11-19 20:57:41 o equilíbrio regional e mundial no "ouro negro", criando uma situação que dura até aos dias de hoje.

(Curiosamente, o primeiro poço da Venezuela, no Orinoco, também foi descoberto por uma empresa privada: a mesma Standard Oil.
1660 2018-11-19 20:57:31 Is it too early to wonder if Mogg Johnson and Farage and the rest of the ERG are actually just self serving disaster capitalist snake oil salesmen who can’t count to 48? Asking for a friend
1661 2018-11-19 20:57:31 That's a good question. It's machine oil we use when cutting the pipes but we flush the whole system after installation.. after a few years residual oil and whatever else settles near the sprinkler heads. So much water is released that im not sure it could burn.
1662 2018-11-19 20:57:27 oil rigs are so fascinating in the way they work? especially the water rigs
1663 2018-11-19 20:57:23 But what Curbelo and the Republicans and their owners in the oil industry have done has all just been honest and decent and never any lawsuits used to intimidate, right? No shame.

ただ、データ見せるのはかなり信頼が必要だとは思うけど
1667 2018-11-19 20:56:58 What has she done for Albertans for the last 3 1/2 years! NOTHING!! She is buying votes!! We have a business in the oil and gas sector! Been through 1980, 1997, 2008/09 never seen it like this, since the NDP became government. VOTE THEM OUT 2019!!
1668 2018-11-19 20:56:56 Please stop using palm oil in your products. They are quite tasty but I do not buy them because of this environmentally destructive ingredient.
1669 2018-11-19 20:56:40 What kind of SNAKE OIL is a “Jobs First Brexit”??? Any Brexit will leave us poorer and no say within Europe. 

This is absolute bollocks!!!
1670 2018-11-19 20:56:39 do qual o dinheiro público deveria ficar de fora.

Desde o início, o setor privado é um grande protagonista. Por exemplo, o primeiro poço de petróleo descoberto no Golfo Árabe não foi descoberto por nenhum "Petro-Arabe", mas sim pela Standard Oil, cuja atuação viria a inverter

1672 2018-11-19 20:56:30 "... they were using an oil and gas production sharing agreement and the economics just don't work for mining." Mark Campbell @AtonResources $AAN with @KerryLutz November 12, 2018 #EgyptMining
1673 2018-11-19 20:56:21 Whether you talk about a roll of the dice, or the value of a crude oil in 2020, the right way to model that uncertain value is with a random variable.

One can ask: what is the "expected value" a.k.a. "mean" of the random variable, one can also ask what is its "median" aka "P50".
1674 2018-11-19 20:56:19 Huh, they did didn’t they.  Yet that underground oil spill that went on for at least a month, probably longer hardly got any coverage.  It absolutely wasn’t Obama’s fault!  I didn’t think it was, but neither are these disasters.  Trump is very quick to act as well.  Don’t get it?
1675 2018-11-19 20:56:19 Fracking allows companies to produce more oil and natural gas than ever before. RETWEET if you support fracking!
1676 2018-11-19 20:56:14 Domestic food security. In war long shelf life is advantageous e.g. grains/veg oil.
Capitalism and the persuit of ever increasing profits even on huge margin products e.g. pizza, baked goods, fast food. Need to reduce costs on expensive items for thr masses. So yeah big food
1677 2018-11-19 20:56:00 Pan fry Bacon leeks garlic, add a fuck ton of cheese into a rue plus grain mustard .cook rigatoni for 10mins in salted water with glug of olive oil. Mix all together add   salt pepper, shred mozzarella on top bake 30 mins
1678 2018-11-19 20:56:00 Coffee is the second most traded commodity on Earth after oil.
1679 2018-11-19 20:55:54 See pro independence supporters that go on non stop about oil reserves can fuck right off.
1680 2018-11-19 20:55:48 Is ‘palm oil free’ the latest ‘gluten free’? Shall we look forwards to palm oil free water, vodka and vegetables?
1681 2018-11-19 20:55:24 America produces stuff & export alot of products unlike Nigeria that has crude oil making up 98% of its export. Oga go & study ur economics again,the dollar gotten from the export of crude oil is used to service import payment thereby making the naira to weak
1682 2018-11-19 20:55:23 La crème hydratante de olive oil, la compo n'est pas ouf, mais l'odeur tu l'as jusqu'à la fin de vie
1683 2018-11-19 20:55:20 Why thank you  Followed up with Age Defying Eye Repair and Oil Eliminator Toner = perfect remedy for a tough Monday!
1684 2018-11-19 20:55:15 Ого, все это говорила водолею и он меня до сей пор не убил
1685 2018-11-19 20:55:09 So the guy at pepboys really just paid for my oil change and a flush  what did i do to deserve this
1686 2018-11-19 20:55:09 I don’t understand sorry. It’s not the same every year – you’ve just taken one set of numbers (net solar PV capacity additions). There’s plenty more happening in the energy system than just solar PV! (e.g. see the oil chapter!)
1687 2018-11-19 20:55:06 Never take your car to Walmart for an oil change
1688 2018-11-19 20:55:06 Well, I don’t drink, so oil, I guess, if I had to choose between the two.  I know this is some kind of metaphor.
1689 2018-11-19 20:55:04 why does all body lotion have mineral oil im going to fight
1690 2018-11-19 20:55:04 Use olive oil.
1691 2018-11-19 20:54:56 Like clearly she has bigger skincare issues than a highly pigmented eyeshadow? Maybe use an oil based eye makeup remover instead of makeup wipes and making irritating videos to entertain exactly 3 people
1692 2018-11-19 20:54:48 Must have been fried with a blue whale' s oil extract...very wonderful something
1693 2018-11-19 20:54:21 QQQ set up to  $152  , Dow 30 could see 23600 -  if thats the case , that would pretty much eliminate the need for Dec hike given drop in Oil will deflate CPI as well.
1694 2018-11-19 20:54:17 Chain. Hubs.
That's why I bought a commuter with 11Speed oil lubed Hub. Hydralic discs and belt drive.
1695 2018-11-19 20:53:53 as soon as the rain comes i'm going to oil all the wooden tool handles. remember those? !!!!!

1696 2018-11-19 20:53:50 Who is trying to teach me how to change my own oil?
1697 2018-11-19 20:53:36 Zoflora  Ooohhh and coconut oil 
1698 2018-11-19 20:53:35 @realDonaldTrump Whether Tramp and some officials say they did not completely cut off Iran's oil exports because of the price of oil, it's an excuse, the main reason that the trump did not bring Iran's oil exports to zero was due to the pressure of capitalists in the US
1699 2018-11-19 20:53:26 The export pipeline that wouldn't have displace a single barrel of Saudi oil? That pipeline?
1700 2018-11-19 20:53:14 Согласна, даже смотреть полностью не стала, а промотала(да простят меня арми). Такая ерунда, и наполовину до бигхита не дотягивает
1701 2018-11-19 20:52:59 "We implemented a responsible and transparent fiscal plan for the challenging economic times that saw us doing more even with lesser oil revenues" 

Join us on this journey to the NEXT LEVEL of a prosperous, strong and stable Nigeria!
1702 2018-11-19 20:52:58 Sugar and olive oil for a quick impromptu lip scrub for chapped lips 
1703 2018-11-19 20:52:56 I haven’t but I’d smear coconut oil all over your eyes. It’ll help take it off and help with irritation
1704 2018-11-19 20:52:52 The oil majors invest more in renewable than any other entity by far and have for a long time.
1705 2018-11-19 20:52:51 3 hours for a fuckin oil change???
1706 2018-11-19 20:52:49 The issue here is that even in the best case scenario, the SPV(s)’ utility is quite limited—narrow humanitarian use or trade w European SMEs and small banks that risk being sanctioned. No oil, no planes, no big transactions.
1707 2018-11-19 20:52:44 I’m sensitive to weed but CBD oil has dramatically changed my life. No more anxiety, stabilizes my mood, WAY better sleep, body actually feels better, I literally am happier!!! So glad it’s working for you too  weighted blankets are magical too 
1708 2018-11-19 20:52:39 If only we owned our oil.

Don't like what the free market does with the oil then you have to nationalize it
1709 2018-11-19 20:52:30 Friend: I’m so stressed...

Me: Have you tried CBD oil? 

***

Sister: I have so much laundry 

Me: Have you tried CBD oil? 

***

Neighbor: my cat died

Me: Have you tried CBD oil?
1710 2018-11-19 20:52:27 Got 130 pairs of fake lashes, snow tires, an oil change, and a Brazilian today. Safe to say this has been my most productive day ever.
1711 2018-11-19 20:52:14 You can get that stuff all on Etsy and it’s not that expensive. Also coconut oil is a good lotion. You can get natural deodorant at Walmart now I’m pretty sure too but that’s easy to make yourself.
1712 2018-11-19 20:52:12 Envoys to Tidewater!  Perhaps a long line of envoys all the way to the coast will solve the oil differential.
1713 2018-11-19 20:52:12 Imagine going from that to hot ass peanut oil. Human beings are on point
1714 2018-11-19 20:52:06 So as I did my First shop at ICELAND as I like their NO PALM OIL Initiative So will give them a Month Trial My Wife is feverishly trying to book flights To go to a funeral while my Daughter is in ICELAND The country looking at Geysers
1715 2018-11-19 20:51:57 did you get tea tree oil
1716 2018-11-19 20:51:57 Comically, deliver a no-deal Brexit and the oil on the flames would be more like rocket fuel. The fallout would make the Tories unelectable for a generation and it would decimate the credibility of anyone who ever uttered the thought that Brexit was a good idea.
1717 2018-11-19 20:51:54 Barrel of oil 56.36 why is gas still over 3.00 a gallon,can someone explain
1718 2018-11-19 20:51:40 Awww, adorable, the Trump troll got busted trying to lie about being a former Democrat. When called out it then tries the troll tactic of claiming everyone ELSE is angry...yet IT is the one swearing and blame calling. Maybe if oil prices go back up Putin can afford better trolls.
1719 2018-11-19 20:51:35 Currently almond oil and vitamin e oil plus invest in vitamin c serums they work wonders and my cream is Shea and cocoa butter it’s natural had to blend it myself however you can purchase it from amazon if you find that too messy lol
1720 2018-11-19 20:51:28 Anyone that uses a pressed pigment bright eyeshadow knows it has potential to stain your eyelids, just get some cleansing oil it’s not that serious.
1721 2018-11-19 20:51:13 The poorly cleared chaperel, brush which has an extremely hi oil content is the issue. Prior to the huge increase in population, this brush regularly burned due to natural causes posed less a threat. Now people don’t clear, want privacy, brush gets thick & there ya go.
1722 2018-11-19 20:51:11 The worst part of this aint the money; it’s the moral hazard and social anger that resulted. The wealthy were able to clean up in commodities, oil and gold. Govt did nothing to tax any of that. This and the austerity is a fucking disgrace: Brexit & Trump resulted
1723 2018-11-19 20:51:10 Despite #oil rebound late last week, there was consistent intraday selling.. Today we have the opposite, opened lower, consistent bid bringing it positive on the day - Gotta bean oil bull here... Saudi comments coming soon???
1724 2018-11-19 20:51:06 i remember when a guy told me i was a diva because i had like oil blotting papers and was using them and also bc i put on some body spray like ? HOW? it’s just...good hygiene..something you clearly don’t have

1730 2018-11-19 20:50:40 When our longliner sunk a couple years ago, coast guard was here for 3 days in case of a fuel/oil leak and we had to pay them for it. Even though they didn't do anything but stand around
1731 2018-11-19 20:50:35 I was sent to Twitmo after some idiot called @DLoesch a beard for @ChrisLoesch and I then called the guy a “little pansy-ass” for setting his account to private. That’s apparently a gay slur, but calling Dana a beard somehow isn’t.
1732 2018-11-19 20:50:31 It's very possible that trump could be the 1st president for as long as anyone can remember that won't have invaded another country or started a war for oil . If he wants to ruin his own country let him off !
1733 2018-11-19 20:50:31 Well Chris watts got 3 life sentences but I sincerely hope it’s the most terrible rest of his life that he could imagine, we should just throw him in crude oil but alive though lol
1734 2018-11-19 20:50:23 Acrylic paint dries so quick oil paint dries so slow (and I don’t have the right shit to paint with oils rn) guess I gotta try water color

1737 2018-11-19 20:50:07 It’s a tough one...I really like Vegenaise too  This one I think has a bit more oil in it so it’s smoother and a bit creamier! ~ CH
1738 2018-11-19 20:50:03 Oh dear again. Sorry to inform you. But the price of oil fell thru the floor. Sh*t happens in politics eh ( actually I would like to see a deficit plan. But I got my partisan hat on. Like you)
1739 2018-11-19 20:49:54 It could but refineries are not equipped and/or prefer Saudi oil
1740 2018-11-19 20:49:32 And baby oil removes tar from the feet for those who live in some places on the left coast.
1741 2018-11-19 20:49:31 And look at your hands taking the small oil that is to pour and found it and then a little salt 

Is that good 

Or a little more and a second punch of salt in you tiny small hands

1742 2018-11-19 20:49:22 Is @HarryDentjr a future reading Harvard educated economist? US equities, crypto’s, oil and gold down; meanwhile real estate and corporate debt are looking shaky.  Treasuries?  #debtbergs and #recalibration #BlackFridayWeek
1743 2018-11-19 20:49:22 Thanksgiving Recipes! NO oil!  Enjoy
1744 2018-11-19 20:49:05 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
1745 2018-11-19 20:48:58 That made us pay through our nose for our tertiary education, most government managed enterprises sold under the watch of @atiku we're no where to be found except those from the oil & gas. Enough of rent economy and freebies to the Next level for real growth and  development
1746 2018-11-19 20:48:52 If you changed your oil on your car in your driveway and spilled a drop better have a spill kit before the environmental cops show up and charge you lol
1747 2018-11-19 20:48:40 No, no they didn't. We need to move away from these old corporate living thoughts.

They did vote for better Healthcare, civil rights, education, lgbtq rights & fixing & taxing big oil & global warming.
What has Pelosi done so far?
1748 2018-11-19 20:48:38 I really think it is, taking that away plus the cbd oil is keeping me going. Gluten is inflammatory and I’m much less bloated so that’s always a good thing. I’m not missing it but I need to work on remembering!
1749 2018-11-19 20:48:37 #WhiskyAdvent 105 Palate: Thick spicy honey with an orange oil finish. It's like thick cut orange marmalade without the bits - YUMMY! Hints of dates and figs give it a full bodied texture. Definitely made a mistake getting the 15yo instead of this.....
1750 2018-11-19 20:48:36 ...unless you cut the crops and bury them or otherwise remove them from the carbon cycle.
Intensively managed crops (oil palm, cereals) have as high a net primary productivity as the best natural ecosystems, as long as you fertilize well.
1751 2018-11-19 20:48:26 Turkeys are not given growth hormones. Totally illegal. Some may receive antibiotics to prevent disease but are free of antibiotics by the time they are harvested for consumption. Deep fried in peanut oil is best! Yum
1752 2018-11-19 20:48:07 If you haven’t tried monoi oil for a facial moisturizer, hair smoother and lotion add in you need to try it bc my skin and hair feel like satin
1753 2018-11-19 20:48:05 Poor sweet Unagi. Maybe arthritis? My old kitty has it. CBD oil is supposed to help but my stubborn boy won't take it. Feel better Unagi!
1754 2018-11-19 20:47:57 I'm in Texas and it surprised me too once I started researching it.  Especially given the oil and pickup truck culture here

1759 2018-11-19 20:47:06 That was the baby Oil for sure 
1760 2018-11-19 20:47:03 the power of baby oil my friend
1761 2018-11-19 20:47:03 Sure but only one company, Irving refineries, imports Saudi oil not Canada. They have many options but they choose Saudi oil. Go shame your industry backers that make these choices and not regular Canadians just trying to put gas in the tank.
1762 2018-11-19 20:47:00 I went in to get an oil change and this mechanic was like oh you also need a transmission flush, fuel system cleaning and brake flush. Do you want to call your dad or husband to see if that’s something you’d want to do?

First of all. Fuuuuuuuuck youu dude.
1763 2018-11-19 20:46:58 Once upon a time there was a girl who was enthusiastic & loved words & & thought a mile a minute & wanted desperately to connect to someone. There was a boy who loved her but was quiet & he did his best. She never quite trusted him. Like always. But she loved him. Oil & water.
1764 2018-11-19 20:46:55 Side note to the friends getting free stuff: Pay your artist friends! If they insist not or you're just unable to, do something nice for them! Make them dinner, change their oil, do their hair or whatever, but make sure they know their skills are professional and appreciated!
1765 2018-11-19 20:46:53 Get the softest skin ever by smoothing on baby oil in the shower after washing or add a few drops of baby oil in your body wash and shake!

1767 2018-11-19 20:46:37 Any garlic, lemon, salt or pepper?  Olive oil?
1768 2018-11-19 20:46:29 Why Morocco? The summit will provide national and international companies with an overview of the Morocco’s immense oil and gas potential, its unique geology, licensing, tax regime and legislation related to exploration and production #moroccosummit2019
1769 2018-11-19 20:46:26 My mom filled up my gas tank and got my oil change wow there’s a first time for everything
1770 2018-11-19 20:46:20 A vaccine not without risk being promoted by Murdoch? "Snake oil charmer determines public health" should be headline
1771 2018-11-19 20:46:11 Check your Transmission oil today.
1772 2018-11-19 20:46:10 Do you honestly believe they gave up in the 3rd? I honestly don't think that was even part of the equation. The Flames elevated and had the puck for the entire period.
1773 2018-11-19 20:46:09 M. Macron a été élu par 20 Millions de français. Peut être 50 % le regrette. Mais il en reste 10 Millions et il faudrait qu’il parte parce que 1/4 Million prend la France en otage ??  Je suis en Italie. Belle alliance FN/FI a l italienne. Le gas oil est a 1.56/1.65 € à la pompe

1776 2018-11-19 20:45:56 This is a rerun of the Gilded Age of 100 years ago with Internet taking the place of Oil and Railways - the same kind of greedy robber barons with fortunes based on monopolizing new  technologies
1777 2018-11-19 20:45:54 I just replaced two tires, got my oil changed, plus paid my car insurance, oh yea and filled up. I just love taking car of my car. 
1778 2018-11-19 20:45:42 I can't let hymn do it 

My son I can't let hymn take the oil that is for this and pour it hymnself 

I can't do it .. 

I have to and ask hymn is that enough .. 

I have to go to the hospital  ..
1779 2018-11-19 20:45:40 Compare the treatment @DLoesch gets on a daily basis and this is especially hilarious.   If @TwitterSafety didn't have double standards, they'd have none at all
1780 2018-11-19 20:45:36 That´s great KJ, if you used coconut oil frecuently your skin is going to be super smooth. A know that bc I have been fooling around with a girl that used it everyday and it is great to touch her skin ;)
1781 2018-11-19 20:45:23 So if it's such a crock why is WTI where it is today and why do all oil producing nations have to curtail production just to keep it at these levels? What happened to $130/barrel? Where did it go and why can't it even get back close to those numbers?
1782 2018-11-19 20:45:22 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1783 2018-11-19 20:45:00 It is not about to crash, in spite of economic snake oil from RenewEconomy.
1784 2018-11-19 20:44:45 Honey, lemon, ginger brewed with hot water, dash of bourbon. Then just paracetamol really. Hot bath with some albus oil in it to loosen the chest a bit. If it gets really bad though go see your doctor Scott! Get well soon luv x
1785 2018-11-19 20:44:35 I would still recommend cannabis oil... If already in chemo treatment then I recommend cannabis to keep up appetite as well as mood and take the edge off the pain and all the side-effects of the pills they will be "prescribing" them. Also check youtube for lung cancer & cannabis.
1786 2018-11-19 20:44:31 No tweet on oil prices yet... Hmmmm
1787 2018-11-19 20:44:17 Listen this is me about to take my rites 

And lift the oil and pour it on my popped corn ..

For Real ..freedom let hymn pour his oil 

Or we are leaving g
1788 2018-11-19 20:44:03 Love my virgin coconut oil. I eat it raw, cook with it and use it for my skin care too. Who listens to Big Food anyway...it’s all about the with them 
1789 2018-11-19 20:43:51 Why TF do you dumb ass people wait last minute to get your oil changed
1790 2018-11-19 20:43:41 Having neither oil fields or poppy plants I doubt he can get approval. Must make dollhands so angry to not be as despotic as he and his fans would love.

1792 2018-11-19 20:43:26 oil!

1800 2018-11-19 20:42:43 @kaltirecareers back after 2 weeks with a low engine light and no oil in the engine. Had to be towed back to shop. 3.5 hour wait for original service then followed by a tow ride back a week and a half later. Not a fun experience at all. What next?
1801 2018-11-19 20:42:35 coconut oil too prlly

1808 2018-11-19 20:41:39 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
1809 2018-11-19 20:41:32 Hey @TwitterSupport ! Wanna explain why I’ve had to block a petroleum company three times? I should not have my blocks reversed just because you folks are desperate for more Oil Dollars!
1810 2018-11-19 20:41:23 It should be clear to all that Butts' plan is to exterminate our oil industry.
1811 2018-11-19 20:41:15 I got alllll the way home and realized I don’t have enough cooking oil for dinner tonight 

Like I’m FRYING shrimp ... the shrimp need the oil man
1812 2018-11-19 20:41:13 Best way is to take a natural oil of your choice, massage the oil into your face for a minute, then get a really damp, warm cloth and put it over your face for a bit to let the steam open your pores, then wipe off the oil
1813 2018-11-19 20:41:06 If you do your research you shall find that it's the same case with all those other nations you mentioned, except Arab oil states whose visas are issued for exploitatative purposes for the Africans.
1814 2018-11-19 20:41:02 @naturallycurly I love wearing my hair natural, but the tangles are killing me. What product can I use to detangle that will not leave a residue? I heard baby oil is an option.
1815 2018-11-19 20:41:01 I’ve never really noticed staining maybe because I never apply eyeshadow correctly?
I always oil cleanse and then foam cleanse 
1816 2018-11-19 20:40:52 this oil is accessible with wazu ka pani and dhair sara water intake
1817 2018-11-19 20:40:51 US needed someone else to replace EU CB's excess $ mopup service. China was brought in, opened market, US invested, brought technology and China in exchange supported the USD system. 
Oil was happy, new Big customer emerged and oil price was brought up. US was developing shales..
1818 2018-11-19 20:40:43 Just think, Vancouver - with a little more effort from the Liberals and, perhaps, a tantrum or two more from Notley, WE could have this sort of amaaazing tourist attraction! "Come, see the enormous oil spills of the west coast", we'd say!

1823 2018-11-19 20:40:16 oh damn I've been there;;; listen if it's beef liver cut it into thin strips, put it in boiling oil until it gets light, then add a tbsp of minced garlic with sliced jalepeno, and add salt, pepper, lots of cumin, and coriander. Add lime juice before eating, eat with pita bread.

1831 2018-11-19 20:38:58 Prior to 2014 Oil slump & 2016 to April 2017, the discrepancy between the BTA & BDC rates was N2-N5.
1832 2018-11-19 20:38:53 Depends what's on offer! The OPEC states aren't exactly brimming over with culture, per capita purchase power or, well, anything... but they do rather well on the trade front because they have one thing everyone wants - oil
1833 2018-11-19 20:38:42 Swedish crisp bread. Coconut oil, coconut flakes, cocoa. Butter, lard, oil. Milk powder. Condensed milk. Dulce de leche.
Sugar, molasses, dates and dried fruit. Egg powder. Cream of wheat. 
Getting hungry now from thinking of all the things you can make with that.
1834 2018-11-19 20:38:35 This is Katz's biggest flaw in my mind, who he puts in charge. If he can fix who he's got at the table of brain trust then I do think he's actually a good owner.
1835 2018-11-19 20:38:34 Or in Iceland, the anti palm oil supermarket, not the country, as they aren’t in the EU, so it wouldn’t be ironic. That’s it, wasted enough time on him. 
1836 2018-11-19 20:38:32 We need ALL Dems working on #climatechange NOW. We also need Dems to stop taking funds from the oil and gas companies if we ever want to really get at a solution. Regenerative Agriculture also needs to be part of the conversation. #GreenNewDeal
1837 2018-11-19 20:38:30 Umm...would that oil be flammable?
1838 2018-11-19 20:38:30 More tips;
-Don’t touch your face a lot 

-Don’t use a lot of hairspray 

-Don’t pop your spots

-Get good night sleep

-try oil free moisturiser 

(Ig; Boba.Threadss)
1839 2018-11-19 20:38:29 Enlighten me. Why do all oil companies increase the price of gas when oil prices go up?  The same macroeconomics should apply. Raw material price increase or tax increase, same effect, same result.
1840 2018-11-19 20:38:29 Why do you know so little? Oil industry analysts know that with pipelines to tidewater they fetch a better price. The price is discounted because we only have one customer. Shipping offshore/more money for oil companies producers and governments
1841 2018-11-19 20:38:29 Absolutely not.  Like oil and water, religion and politics don't mix.
1842 2018-11-19 20:38:25 "Jim, why do you have a giant vat of hot oil  in the back yard?" "Um... world's largest fondue pot?" #seemslegit
1843 2018-11-19 20:37:56 Great to see some positive news coming from @DavidLenigas @DoriemusOil and more to come from CEO Stephen Sanderson @UKOGlistedonAIM. Another step closer to home grown oil and a giant leap towards increasing UK revenue. #GatwickGusher #HHDL not so fake and misleading after all!
1844 2018-11-19 20:37:54 I really need to try oil painting

1850 2018-11-19 20:37:39 OK so they have the interests of Malaysian & Indonisian farmers but their efforts to promote sustainable palm oil are valid. Something Greenpeace Richard fails to acknowledge
1851 2018-11-19 20:37:39 Market Mover Update: Today crude oil futures dropped to their lowest level since last Tuesday’s -6% implosion, but quickly rebounded to get back to breakeven on the day.
1852 2018-11-19 20:37:39 Not to mention even the most liberal forecasts have oil demand rising into the 2020’s.
1853 2018-11-19 20:37:36 Meh doesn't matter in the end. No here really knows how it works or who does what. 
The answer is just fire them all and start completely over. It will never happen. The person making that call is the problem. Fact. 
But hey lets just keep putting lipstick and makeup on the pig.
1854 2018-11-19 20:37:35 China prefers modernization and happy working population.
My take is that after Euro was launched and oil almost switched, it created real default possibility for USD system. Oil was kept high and gold abbys was avoided. The triangular arrangement has been developed
US-China-Oils
1855 2018-11-19 20:37:22 one of them is wearing a beret, but the captain looks like an oil baron
1856 2018-11-19 20:37:13 Yet, all my Muslim friends are perfectly happy for Saudi Arabia and Iran to sell the Chicoms all the oil they need. So true in the aftermath of Khashoggi is the adage "one death is a tragedy, 1,000,000 deaths is a statistic". And the Chicoms know that oh so well.
1857 2018-11-19 20:37:12 On a cash flow yield basis some of the upstream players are crazy cheap.  I believe in EV revolution but you can buy some small upstream guys now @ 30% FCF yield.  Implying that as long as oil continues to be a thing for 3 years you should theoretically breakeven at worst
1858 2018-11-19 20:36:55 I love getting my oil changed and all of the 176 questions I get asked about things that I might like to “add on.” Said no woman ever.
1859 2018-11-19 20:36:47 Oil change and plugs done, along with some Brembo disks and pads and a few other bits sorted. Power feels smoother again, easier through corners to modulate power, brakes will take a while to bed in fully but initial bite is great.
1860 2018-11-19 20:36:14 The five stages of grief are: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. A loving father would never bury his daughters in the oil tanks if he did not kill them. Did he smoke marijuana? I agree they should let the mother to talk to her son before sentencing.
1861 2018-11-19 20:36:02 Another fun fact about compressed air is that air compressor systems actually create a large amount of heat. That's why the systems can only be cooled down with the use of oil, cooler air or water.
1862 2018-11-19 20:35:59 Inaccurate figures when SCOTTISH oil revenue is included as Scottish revenue not UK. Ditto every other Scottish revenue stream that is logged as 'UK'. That's before you get started on what gets spent on 'our behalf' (without our say). Standard response is these stats are crap.

1867 2018-11-19 20:35:22 anyone: speaks about oil 

my brain:

1868 2018-11-19 20:35:08 Low Oil Ionised Cookware
1869 2018-11-19 20:34:48 That the WWE Universe comes a distant second to advertisers, sponsors and oil money.
1870 2018-11-19 20:34:40 Its the media's fault that almost all republicans are ok with the fact that he's a narcissistic snake oil salesman? OK.
1871 2018-11-19 20:34:32 블록팔이 참치마요 왜 연락이 없누ㅡㅡ
1872 2018-11-19 20:34:26 Equities, because (at least in my micro-cap world) they never really moved with higher oil.  Companies are going to kill it with higher prices and a bit of operational success. The world need $100 oil to stay on track, but won't know that until it's too late.
1873 2018-11-19 20:34:25 Good news world the oil prices are now controlled by only three people. @realDonaldTrump @PutinRF_Eng @MbSofKSA
1874 2018-11-19 20:34:19 So disappointed @GordonRamsay that we couldn’t eat at your #Vegas #fishandchips! Cooking #shellfish in same oil as other foods...#allergic...so sad!
1875 2018-11-19 20:34:18 Quebec Hypocrisy
-Equalization $ from other Provinces & get lowest Tuitions & Daycare
-BlockOil pipeline get tanker oil from Killer Saudi’s, Venezuela
& USA Oil train kills 47
-Keep Out much cheaper US Dairy 
-Dump 5 Billion ltrs of Raw sewage in St Lawrence R still doing it.
1876 2018-11-19 20:34:06 I’d rather stick needles in my eyes while being boiled in oil than watch Ireland play football under that management #DENIRL
1877 2018-11-19 20:33:51 Oh Susan, you should be on the Buckeye wagon not buying snake oil from Cougs
1878 2018-11-19 20:33:50 Switching to shea butter and coconut oil as my body cream is the best decision i made for my skin
1879 2018-11-19 20:33:50 please tell me why i just came to get my oil changed and there isn’t a soul in here, the Lord is really on my side today
1880 2018-11-19 20:33:49 Make sure your child’s vaccine doesn’t have peanut oil, as some do.
1881 2018-11-19 20:33:47 Shout out to the historical person who accidentally dropped their sliced potato into some hot ass oil. Papa's fritas always hits
1882 2018-11-19 20:33:40 Cologne sampling box, beard oil set, soap on a rope and the cute man scents of poo-pourri 
1883 2018-11-19 20:33:40 Please when calling me, LEAVE A MESSAGE if I don't pick up. It makes me sad that so many decide not to leave a message and miss out on ordering!.. This oil is awesome!. I do call all customers back.. BUT ONLY if you leave a message! lol~ Thanks!
1884 2018-11-19 20:33:37 @Egilostenstad if oil Mitchell came to saints do u think jardim would come said he manager
1885 2018-11-19 20:33:34 No, SA, OIL are two groups i am in, i want to S/O them, and Brick is the main group on top, he doesn't have twitter. so the brick here is not brick. 
S/O brickhouse.
1886 2018-11-19 20:33:22 If they had been supported by the rich Arab oil gov'ts,& if they had had rich organizations giving them aid like your Zio orgs.If the UN had given a connected piece of land,and independence, with sovereignty and were permitted to have an army, things wld've been very !different
1887 2018-11-19 20:33:19 I think they're probably almost exactly the same, except these caramelize slightly, so they're sweeter. And I can only get sundried tomatoes packed in jars with olive oil here, and sometimes that's just too oily for how I want to use them.
1888 2018-11-19 20:33:12 I am currently addicted to the rosemary and olive oil ones ><;;
1889 2018-11-19 20:33:11 Les émissions de soufre sont interdites en mer du Nord et dans la manche et bientôt  en Méditerranée Pour cela les navires sont équipés de laveurs de fumées (scrubbers) ou sont contraints d'utiliser un fuel desoufré (hso ou gas oil) plus cher ll faut s'informer là aussi

1891 2018-11-19 20:33:09 White Mom: *walks into store*

Her brain: 
Don’t say it
Don’t say it
Don’t say it
Don’t say it
Don’t say it
Don’t say it

Her: “I think we need some more essential oil diffusers.”
1892 2018-11-19 20:33:08 Took me longer than it should to figure out that it's not 130 real degrees 
Was wondering why all the water wouldn't boil off. Could cook in oil maybe?
1893 2018-11-19 20:32:57 Because they're leading the push to remove them so the land can be used for oil/gas/minerals and they can get richer
1894 2018-11-19 20:32:51 oil hai oil hai 
1895 2018-11-19 20:32:49 El ciclo siempre se repite. Vamos a volver a la misma era estilo "Standard Oil", donde todo era manejado por 1 o máximo 2 compañías... Ya lo estamos viendo, aunque aún no de manera tan descarada
1896 2018-11-19 20:32:44 The invisible hand is raking back crypto’s, US equities and oil. #rakingtheforest #adamsmith #invisiblehand #RakeAmericaGreatAgain
1897 2018-11-19 20:32:28 Eric they will make it out of hemp fibre.  Think of all that carbon capture located inside the car!  Don’t know what they will do with the oil based tires.
1898 2018-11-19 20:32:27 This week has been very tempting and stressful. Like the biggest temptation ever. My boss got sacked today, i poured hot oil on my laps on Saturday. Today i left the gas at minimal with stew on top and went to work. I came back smelling goat meat everywhere.
1899 2018-11-19 20:32:25 Officials say the state of the Watts home was fairly normal, but sheets were taken off the bed. Some were in the trash, one was found wrapped around Shannan’s body near the oil tank.
1900 2018-11-19 20:32:24 We in Ireland have a golden opportunity because of our location on the globe with westerly winds flowing across the Atlantic to build wind farms to drive our railways, and our factories without importing oil or coal or gas cutting down carbon and cutting our balance of payments
1901 2018-11-19 20:32:19 I agree to all that you are saying but there are 3 big oil holding countries Russia, USA and Saudi Arabia. He needs to play he's cards right.
1902 2018-11-19 20:32:18 Nope ;)
1903 2018-11-19 20:32:14 #Iceland no palm oil nice!
1904 2018-11-19 20:32:02 To be fair, her head does look like an oil spill.
1905 2018-11-19 20:31:49 Let us know if you need a unit to process 3000 t / a of wood into 800 t of biochar, 600 t oil and some fuel gas..agro residues will work fine too

All of Africa including Gold rich South and oil rich Nigeria have half the GDP of France alone.
1908 2018-11-19 20:31:37 Pakistan doesn’t export oil, Saudis do. Both evil but do you want oil at doll 200? I don’t think so
1909 2018-11-19 20:31:33 Yep. That's it.

Even oil industry analyst types know this stuff
1910 2018-11-19 20:31:20 Sleep please engulf me so I can wake up later to burn the midnight oil
1911 2018-11-19 20:31:15 Oil of Oregano...4 drops in water 4x daily. Also, lots of raw garlic! Oil of Oregano is a natural anti viral, anti fungal and excellent for respiratory infections. Just at the tail end myself!
1912 2018-11-19 20:31:13 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
1913 2018-11-19 20:31:11 UCP House Leader Jason Nixon says he's "offended" by the appointment of the premier's former chief of staff Brian Topp as a special envoy to work with the oil industry
1914 2018-11-19 20:31:04 The government of Burkina Faso has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Lance Armstrong in a linen wig.
1915 2018-11-19 20:30:56 As long as oil is purchased in $USD, the US enjoys the benefits of being the world's ATM. It's a major currency for a plethora of reasons; but you NEED it to get crude.

"It is difficult for a man to understand, that which his salary depends upon him not understanding."
1916 2018-11-19 20:30:56 He looks after the whole deal and when it comes to the old boys club, the only ones who likely have much of a say are MacT & Gretzky, and the latter wasn't around for the past. Lowe has little to do with the hockey side and Howson is in charge of player development
1917 2018-11-19 20:30:48 AIROPRO OIL CARTRIDGES ARE ONLY $29 TODAY!
1918 2018-11-19 20:30:48 Stir together 9 oz barbecue with 9 oz goose. Mix into  Olive Oil. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve a la mode
1919 2018-11-19 20:30:45 I want a long massage. With a lot of oil. So much oil we keep fucking slipping n sliding.
1920 2018-11-19 20:30:43 Why the Khashoggi crisis could finally start to affect oil prices: PHUK ARAB OIL PRICES ! WE HAVE ENOUGH OIL RIGHT HERE IN THE STATES !!! OIL SHOULD BE DECLARED A UTILITY AND GREATLY REGULATED, NOT BE A PHUK'N CROOKED MONEY MAKIN' SCHEME FOR THE REPUBLICUNT CORP "KOCH"-SUKKAS !!!

1925 2018-11-19 20:30:11 not fit to polish Tom Baker's brown brogues mate, nor change the oil in Pertwee's yellow Model T

I can never forgive DT for ruining Hamlet with his stupid gurning malarkey. His rendition of the soliloquy looked like he had sat on a cactus while chewing boot leather.
1926 2018-11-19 20:30:10 Other than geopolitical interest, impoverished countries that have limited oil,  gas, and mineral resources need no policy rather they are bombed...
1927 2018-11-19 20:30:09 At what expense did Germany and USA succeed? Those are imperialist countries who killed to be rich. Look at the terror the usa is bringing in iraq for oil. As for china, it isnt a fully capitalist state n if u think things like child labour are good then i dont want such a state
1928 2018-11-19 20:30:05 That’s wtf I’m saying I know they gotta be taxing I need free refills on oil 
1929 2018-11-19 20:29:47 Oh, I was always trained it had to be reported and investaged by network rail as the adhesion issues could be contamination such as oil and thus a health and safe risk as drivers could SPAD
1930 2018-11-19 20:29:43 For sure throat, take organic honey,straight. For chest infection, oregano oil. Potent.
1931 2018-11-19 20:29:41 The amount of corn embedded in our food is also a significant issue for the rising number of Americans allergic to corn.  It's hidden - not just the obvious corn oil, starch, syrup but also all the fillers and hidden through renaming such as dextrose variants.
1932 2018-11-19 20:29:39 And how many people in those colder areas do you think will attempt to deep fry their turkey? What implications would that have with so much ... solid water around scorching hot oil?
1933 2018-11-19 20:29:37 I cooked myself some pasta at home for the first time in months that wasn’t just drenched in garlic and olive oil. Guys, I’ve come a long way with my cooking prowess. This is restaurant quality right here. #donticookforaliving?
1934 2018-11-19 20:29:30 Beard oil is a must 
1935 2018-11-19 20:29:28 Obviously you know nothing about the tailings ponds. You only know what anti - oil

They are being cleaned as we speak.

You people are “Destroying” the Canadian economy, who do you think is going to pay for Health Care @ social services? 
“IRRESPONSIBLE”
1936 2018-11-19 20:29:21 Wow. He talks from both sides of the mouth ALL the time. HOW do his followers continue to buy his snake oil!?! Trump believes in ABSOLUTELY nothing but the power of $$. Anyhow, keep keeping them honest, Jim. 
1937 2018-11-19 20:29:16 The normal response is denial and them some rubbish about whisky exports and secret oil fields
1938 2018-11-19 20:29:02 When the owl flew into that Oil that's what changed it...

They're all gonna laugh at u
1939 2018-11-19 20:28:59 Getting my life together today. Getting that oil change that I’ve been neglecting to do for a couple hundreds of miles past the amount 
1940 2018-11-19 20:28:58 Not if Trump can help it. He’s got interest in oil as well as his backers! Dakota Access pipeline!
1941 2018-11-19 20:28:37 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
1942 2018-11-19 20:28:19 Dont think smoking cannabis is  allowed for medicinal purposes, but cannabis oil is. Under stricted supervision, and don't think you would be driving any way as your supposed to very sick.
1943 2018-11-19 20:28:05 Needs to be about 30 feet higher my good sir. The constantina wire needs to have twice as many blades as well and there’s needs to be another two rows with 60 foot high smooth oil producing walls on either side and then wide lion filled pits before in between and after the wire.
1944 2018-11-19 20:28:03 No, Add tubers of yam, bags of rice, palm oil, groundnut oil
1945 2018-11-19 20:28:02 I've never roasted them that long. I usually have them raw with salt, and maybe cheese/basil/olive oil - or roasted for a few mins with nuts on a pan. I'll have to try your way too  now :)
1946 2018-11-19 20:27:39 Oil and gummies, they help me with my anxiety and sleep! @NellaSparkles
1947 2018-11-19 20:27:35 Oregeno oil, ginger tea, raw garlic  & a throat swab from Doctor to rule out strep.  Plus what she said 
1948 2018-11-19 20:27:28 I used grape seed oil because I’m very acne prone and I saw Labeautyologist mention it would be good to use. Worked like a dream! I hear sweet almond oil is great too
1949 2018-11-19 20:27:25 Gargle and swallow soluble asprin..good for.throat pain.  Also for the chest infection...couple of neat drops of tea tree oil straight on your chest. Drink plenty of fluids. At night...Night Nurse. Does the world of good for trying to sleep :)
1950 2018-11-19 20:27:10 Dear @GarShehu why is it that you respond swiftly to political matters but never ever deem it necessary to convey the yearnings of Nigerians to @MBuhari, for months we've been complaining about the insecurities in #Zamfara but not a single statement as the conditions deteriorate.
1951 2018-11-19 20:27:02 But we pay $60 for the Saudi oil  arriving in Quebec in tankers.
1952 2018-11-19 20:26:55 Oga please can you talk to Ambode not to allow all Lagos roads fall apart before 2019.

Ozumba entrance via Bonny camp 
Ahmadu Bello stretch 
Falomo link bridge 
Falomo rdabout infront of forte oil 
Alternative road etc. 

He won't fix them with his money nah. What's his problem
1953 2018-11-19 20:26:35 Same fish oil tablets help 
1954 2018-11-19 20:26:21 it's an epidemic, it seems. do you know about the organic coconut oil...?
1955 2018-11-19 20:26:15 Heck no, I have convection oven, my Gran would kill me if I dipped it in oil with no good stuffing or gravy.
1956 2018-11-19 20:26:14 I usually hate tomatoes, but I love roasted cherry tomatoes. I slice them in half, brush with olive oil, add salt, pepper, and roast at very low heat in the oven for a few hours until they've lost about half of their moisture. I can throw them in almost any savory dish that way.
1957 2018-11-19 20:26:10 Hasan Minhaj's Patriot Act about the oil industry with that Texas Permian Basin shout out
1958 2018-11-19 20:25:58 They have a population of under 6 million and an oil surplus of almost 1 million pounds for every man woman and child. There GDP is 776 times the worlds average. Nothing to do running the country affectively the have a lot of oil an no population. We haven’t
1959 2018-11-19 20:25:57 They are attacking Corbyn for misleading people into thinking that Labour could now negotiate a better deal and in time to extend A50 and hold a #peoplesVote.

That is a lie and he knows it.  Snake oil.

The EU elections take place in May.   Past time to stop mucking about.
1960 2018-11-19 20:25:52 Quartered and deep fried in peanut oil with a chili lime drizzle brings out a little sweetness and a little heat with the perfect crisp of the outer leaves. I love roasted, but this is hands-down the best way.
1961 2018-11-19 20:25:42 Only people in the NDP are people that hate the oil industry and anyone who works in it.
1962 2018-11-19 20:25:39 Italian style -chilled pasta tossed with olive oil and Parmesan, spinach, chickpeas, roma or cherry tomatoes tossed in Italian dressing, chopped chicken, feta crumbles, pasta chips
1963 2018-11-19 20:25:38 I started applying the cortizone 10 cream to my face and surprisingly it helped my acne A LOT, I also put tea tree oil on pimples! And I try to exfoliate/ use masks 3-4 times a week Bc I noticed that helps my skin clear up
1964 2018-11-19 20:25:33 When  you prove yourself to be gutless once again and fail to impose the Iran sanctions as you bragged about doing it results in an oversupply in the oil market. You are a laughing stock to the world.
1965 2018-11-19 20:25:31 what is the environmental externality tax for petroleum?
@TheStalwart @KatiaPorzo @mdc 
(by no means does this imply i would obstruct a resurrection of energy technology advancement & the progress of a retrograde civilization by attempting to force oil corporations to be liable.)
1966 2018-11-19 20:25:30 Peppermint oil help a lot
1967 2018-11-19 20:25:30 It will change my friend. The knowledge of your generation is what inspires me and others to make it change.
1968 2018-11-19 20:25:09 Have you tried cannabis oil?
1969 2018-11-19 20:25:05 I took a car for an oil change, while in my pj's....granted I had rain pants on over the top, but ..................
1970 2018-11-19 20:25:03 I do this homemade hair mask that consist of Olive oil, egg whites, and flax seed. I can tell you exactly how to make it or give you a link for it. I also use sunflower oil after the shower on dry hair
1971 2018-11-19 20:25:03 @CoastGuardCAN Three days after the SeaRose FPSO marine oil spill involving an estimated c. 1500 barrels of crude 350 kms off the coast of Newfoundland, is there any chance of an incident report from you folks? Have you deployed any response vessels to the site, for instance?
1972 2018-11-19 20:24:59 I use Ultimate Organic Therapy products, they’ve really helped with my hair grown. Particularly the coconut growth oil
1973 2018-11-19 20:24:56 Germany to ban weapons sales to Saudi Arabia & sanction its leaders. Saudis should cut off all oil to Germany.
1974 2018-11-19 20:24:53 I love oil! It has killed my anxiety! @Stonedwifeyy
1975 2018-11-19 20:24:48 On me ! I will oil you dead in the eyes from my window and sit back down.

1980 2018-11-19 20:23:58 me kuna oil swahili ghels huwa nayo time ya mechi noma sana jiulize why watu wakienda coast mbona hawarudi
1981 2018-11-19 20:23:54 So basically anyone in congress invested in any oil or gas stock option should not be drafting or voting on any legislation?  Interesting...!!!  Perhaps she should speak to her new colleagues about this one.
1982 2018-11-19 20:23:51 Documentation is the castor oil of programming. Managers know it must
be good because the programmers hate it so much.
1983 2018-11-19 20:23:50 Doing nothing means not giving you oil.  Is it??
1984 2018-11-19 20:23:44 “But seriously, has anyone seen my baby oil?”
1985 2018-11-19 20:23:34 You keep ordering rigs but they never arrive.
Get the oil out of the ground, half finished jobs everywhere and nothing to show for it.
1986 2018-11-19 20:23:21 Bio oil actually smells amazing 
1987 2018-11-19 20:23:16 These oils r AMAZING!  first found in food hall @ScotlandRHShow. Full of flavour (little goes a long way ). Great to add to salad dressing and for this time of year - 1/3 tsp rosemary oil with a bit of butter/vegan marg, twist of black pepper & salt melted over sprouts - YUM!!

1989 2018-11-19 20:23:12 @AutoNation thanks for taking advantage of my wife at Stevens Creek Acura. Went in for a $90 oil change and you scammed her for $262! Washer fluid and brake cleaner service added on with out clearly communicating. Great way to run a business.

1991 2018-11-19 20:23:03 My son’s battled upper respiratory issues for about 2 years but it’s been particularly bad in the past year. Anyway, someone (God bless this person) suggested that we get a humidifier and use eucalyptus oil in it. It’s been a month and so far, amazing results!
1992 2018-11-19 20:22:57 @JasonGregor rumour has it that there will be a new  coach coming soon to The oil ?!?   Thoughts ?
1993 2018-11-19 20:22:56 Our Army British army are not protected.
ISIS Israel Secret Intelligence Service paid multi millions to create wars in Syria/the East.
Isis created to kill and murder our British soldiers.ISIS bastards, have the best weapons, ready to kill our men.Unjust wars for oil need stopped
1994 2018-11-19 20:22:53 I haven’t oil cleansed in a couple years. I did that shit last night and my face feels like BUTTER. Definitely incorporating it into my regimen again

1997 2018-11-19 20:22:33 The U.S. has enough oil from their Permian and Bakken shale deposits... they don’t need shitty bitumen. There is no war, just rational market behaviour.

The EPA is cutting methane protections in favor of industry interests. Let EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler know that his decision to put polluters' interests over the US public and the climate is unacceptable.
2000 2018-11-19 20:22:18 Lavender oil really makes everything okay
2001 2018-11-19 20:22:16 Unless you're backed by oil money.
2002 2018-11-19 20:22:08 Our GDP is buoyed by our over reliance on crude oil. Apart from oil,  what else do we export to the rest of the world.  We earn less because we export raw materials.
2003 2018-11-19 20:22:03 Why do you think WTI hit $27? ....Why do you think it couldn't get above $75? It isn't peak oil that has come, it's peak oil use. World wide demand for oil has peaked. The world is changing and I for one am glad to see Canada with the foresight to be where we are now.
2004 2018-11-19 20:21:34 dont talk about palm oil n we wont have a problem 
2005 2018-11-19 20:21:31 That’s why y’all shit be falling apart. Y’all steady pushin it and get an oil change once a year 
2006 2018-11-19 20:21:15 All in all i think id had it easy. Once a student poured motor oil all over the car of a colleague of mine. Never caught thw guy.

2009 2018-11-19 20:21:01 A nice thing about being 36 is that I really, really know that pasta with liberal oil and butter and cheese, and wine, and the best episodes of Friends, does actually work for soft comfort and I feel no shame or that I should be doing anything "better".

2013 2018-11-19 20:20:39 more or less you are going to have to come out with Technology that. Quickly and cheaply runs the oil industry out of business.
2014 2018-11-19 20:20:24 The problems that come with this migration cannot be delivered to the U.S and dispersed across the country where it becomes diluted and less apparent, but still just as detrimental in a macro way.
2015 2018-11-19 20:20:24 Mac n cheese expensive w/o the oil though. That’s not bad at all
2016 2018-11-19 20:20:20 #CarbonCapture is Proven. CO2 has been safely captured, transported, injected, and stored for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in the U.S. since the early 1970s, while Norway has stored CO2 from North Sea natural gas production since 1996. #CCSTechFacts
2017 2018-11-19 20:20:19 @realDonaldTrump and his group of elitists will destroy the markets and make off with billions. Look at how low oil is and how high the dollar is. That is a good sign of a slow down coming. Compliments of @realDonaldTrump
2018 2018-11-19 20:20:13 Oil too?
2019 2018-11-19 20:20:11 And they went out, and preached that men should repent.  And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.

2021 2018-11-19 20:20:00 Just wondering what your plan is once all the oil has been used up? Is that when we should start exploring renewable energy? Curious about your thoughts
2022 2018-11-19 20:20:00 All I use is pure olive oil, and I feel 18 everyday, "60". I use pure, cause I like the fruity taste, and it has a higher smoking point over Rachel's EVOO.

2027 2018-11-19 20:19:08 Comparatively, our players play at the level they arrive at.  We don’t seem to have the capacity to turn them into stars, whether it is playing in the minors or playing under coach Todd.  We HAVE to develop.  Can’t just keep hoping for the lottery.
2028 2018-11-19 20:19:02 And he probably is/was. Let's face it though he little say likely when it comes to advice on players. As I understand he mostly deals with OEG as a whole from the business side.
2029 2018-11-19 20:18:57 by telling people to rake the floor to prevent forest fires Trump is diverting the attention to the outrageous statement he made and not at the big oil companies who are in the wallets of our government and perpetuating climate change

2031 2018-11-19 20:18:48 Labor unions are working on behalf of laborers. Pharmaceutical and Oil & Gas lobbies are working on behalf of multi-national billion dollar corporations. Nice try though. What’s wrong with someone representing the low income and middle class?
2032 2018-11-19 20:18:45 Prices will eventually go down, at least out of competition. But for this to happen gov't needs to stabilize currency for quite some time to restore confidence which is very hard to do in the absence of direct hard currency generators, especially oil and gas exports.
2033 2018-11-19 20:18:39 Fuck my JOB FASTTRACK they are not paying us they are not paying us enough to do oil changes we dont get time to eat damn new JOB ME ASAP

2038 2018-11-19 20:18:08 Don’t forget to add sesame oil when you beat the eggs.
2039 2018-11-19 20:18:05 None of them were worried when these migrants just passing through.
They didnt feel the effects of it, likely the NGO money was a benefit to local econ as long as they kept moving. Now they live with the direct effects of it daily on their streets.

2046 2018-11-19 20:17:21 I live in Italy. A friend
of mine had a baby who was constipated and the pediatrician told them to get a sprig of parsley, sprinkle with olive oil and put it in the baby's bum. They were to rotate it a little and this would stimulate a bowel movement....

2060 2018-11-19 20:15:44 Why is a oil change so expensive 
2061 2018-11-19 20:15:39 Certainly not as a percentage of GDP. It is true that Scotland has a trading deficit with the rest of the UK (and also spends in excess of £10bn more than it gathers in tax - oil included).
2062 2018-11-19 20:15:38 Always wear gloves when handling any chemicals as cleaners are designed to remove oil and grease as well as the natural oils in your skin.
2063 2018-11-19 20:15:22 Maybe you can try a little pure coconut oil to take it off?  It works for me when I have makeup stain my skin
2064 2018-11-19 20:15:17 Build some pipelines. Get tough with BC and Quebec hypocrisy.Saudi oil rolls up the St.Lawrence and BC is biggest exporter of coal.

2073 2018-11-19 20:14:38 no it's just that petroleum/oil is getting rarer, so more expensive and the governement is taking advantage of that to increase even more the taxes on gas but not doing anything to help change our way of life and aim for a gas/oil-free society
2074 2018-11-19 20:14:08 God, it really isn't a pipe dream either.
We spend over 600 billion dollars on military, coal, and oil subsidies alone every year

If we invested that money into building solar plants we'd have the job done in 7 years, RnD not withstanding. We could even pay the military to do it

2086 2018-11-19 20:13:14 How do you make them? We love them too. I usually toss in olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper and roast.
2087 2018-11-19 20:13:03 I’m paying for an oil change, all that other stuff you did ain’t got nothing to do with me. I’m paying for what I asked for.
2088 2018-11-19 20:13:01 How do you think artificial trees are made ? They burn oil to make plastic. What a comment. Thanks for the laugh.
2089 2018-11-19 20:12:51 The scrap yard is calling me, I can feel it and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.

2091 2018-11-19 20:12:31 Would you consider sweet potato fries? Not as bad. Truly it's the deep frying in the oil that is 'really' bad part though. Wouldn't a nice salad be good?
2092 2018-11-19 20:12:29 What do they know?  I heard every firm on wall street + other billionaires say oil would never go above $30 again.  Bitcoin going to $100,000 too.  All so wrong they should all find another profession.

2097 2018-11-19 20:12:13 The reason flat plate is prefered by developers,  because you can place 10 panels on a pallet, ship them out along with a 2nd pallet of parts and of cause the twin coil unvented cylinder, so all the home owner receives is a tank of hot water for washing, which shuts down at 65c

2103 2018-11-19 20:11:16 Tonight for dinner I stuffed a free-range chicken with preserved lemons, garlic, black garlic & butter, smothered it in rose harissa and lemon olive oil, roasted it and served it, sauced in its juices, with couscous mixed with spring onions, pomegranate seeds, sultanas & feta.
2104 2018-11-19 20:11:13 Where's Trudeau? Where's Butts? Where's the country's leadership?  This is a natioanl disaster. This is a natioanal embarrassment.  If this was Quebec it would have been be fixed long ago. Butts is exterminating our oil wealth. We are like a country with no leader.
2105 2018-11-19 20:11:03 My favourite points and questions from @James_Borrell - anti plastic isn't ways the way -> plastic packaging can save food waste, there's 2 sides to every story e.g palm oil, will plastic / climate policy be better pre or post Brexit?

For Shanann's autopsy, her blood alcohol content was .128, which can be consistent with human decomposition and doesn't mean she was drinking. All substances found in toxicology were from oil.

2121 2018-11-19 20:09:26 Getting my screen replaced Friday. And an oil change
2122 2018-11-19 20:09:17 The fact that, in 2014 when Global oil prices plummetted and Alberta went into a mini recession, their first immediate thought was, "we need MORE state investment in our oil fields" instead of "hey maybe our whole provincial economy shouldnt be based around a single export."
2123 2018-11-19 20:09:07 Labor unions represent workers. Pharma and big oil only care about profits at the expense of Americans.
2124 2018-11-19 20:09:06 So, the MLM essencial oil mom club doesn't sell monks hood, marshmellow, fox glove, black cohosh, blue cohosh or wormwood.

The crunchy wiccan down the street does.

Support REAL small business.
2125 2018-11-19 20:09:00 Because it provides calories that are needed to stay alive, and several find it difficult to eat solid food or fat blouses or drink olive oil or are literally on liquid restrictions. Do you listen at all?
2126 2018-11-19 20:09:00 Looking for some updates are you all still drilling what's going on with the use of the oil found?
2127 2018-11-19 20:08:56 The information has now been given to the Audit office to fully investigate, acording to Radio4 which I am sure you can still pick up on Radio4 podcasts. Every time there is a government driven subsidy, the money men supported by banks and investors cheat the system at our cost
2128 2018-11-19 20:08:51 CBD oil has helped me a lot.
2129 2018-11-19 20:08:48 At this point, why is the rest of the world not saying screw the US and keep buying Iranian oil?
2130 2018-11-19 20:08:46 Surpassed 2 hours waiting for my oil change. Jiffy Lube is not so jiffy....
2131 2018-11-19 20:08:35 Half of the think tank and consulting jobs in DC could disappear in the snap of an oil prince or Chinese billionaire's fingers. Those are sinecures for Democrats (and Republicans, of course). Guaranteed bullshit jobs for good pay as long as you're on the team.
2132 2018-11-19 20:08:27 China oil sige. Ikaw na ang naka bangwit ng Gold Fish sa dagat
2133 2018-11-19 20:08:15 It is a lack of consensus and national purpose to recognize that the world and its markets are going to a low- carbon economy, but we need to sell our oil from tidewater to pay for the new green infrastructure. Carbon pricing is meant to form that coalition. #skpoli

2135 2018-11-19 20:08:07 Local CBD oil store @BuyLegaIMeds is doing a clothing drive in partnership with @Coffin4Council at City of Las Vegas. They will be delivering clothing on 12/8. Feel free to reach out if interested.
2136 2018-11-19 20:08:04 I know I didn’t just get a quote for $175 for my oil change got damn

2138 2018-11-19 20:07:50 So @EricTrump wants to maintain a relationship with yet another murderous regime so he can sell them guns & take their oil?
Are they scared of the Saudis?
I’d be more scared of the Russians & their liberal use of Novichoc on people who cross/fail them...
2139 2018-11-19 20:07:48 And this is my partner Burton "Oil Can" Guster
2140 2018-11-19 20:07:46 Lmao they’re sooo bomb with some olive oil and black pepper  have you tried them? They’ll have your house smelling good! Lol
2141 2018-11-19 20:07:39 The better question is why doesn't @Blackrock care?

BlackRock, the largest investor in companies that driving the climate crisis. BlackRock is the number one investor in new coal plant production, a large investor in oil and gas, and the top US investor destroying rainforests.

2144 2018-11-19 20:07:18 I fucking asked B where he took my jeep in for an oil change and he said the same place we always go. I come here and now he says he took it somewhere else. I JUST ARGUED WITH THESE GUYS ABOUT IT UGHHHH. Husband for sale.

2146 2018-11-19 20:07:13 When will you realize that if we keep spending more than half of oil revenues on petrol subsidy, we will never be able to do all these nice things you mention?
2147 2018-11-19 20:07:13 8 yrs of Obama and now nearly 2 yrs of Trump.
10 yrs Liawatha, what exactly have you been doing?
2148 2018-11-19 20:06:56 Synthetic oil is such a scam y’all
2149 2018-11-19 20:06:55 Will you and @martinbarkey be back driving together in the @SuperTrofeo series again in 2019?  I am sure that I'm not the only one who would love to see that happen~!
2150 2018-11-19 20:06:49 Am hoping that the intra day reversal in oil (Brent) holds. Am sure there is some clever chart pattern if it does....reverse doji or whatever?! Certainly hugely disconnect to natural gas of late. Personally think oil was consensual unwind exaggerated by CTA / machine selling.

2154 2018-11-19 20:06:06 Dont you take their oil? and give bullets back?
2155 2018-11-19 20:06:00 We are all in this together so when will you demand that your Province use AB oil products instead of that of Saudi Arabia?
2156 2018-11-19 20:05:57 not for nothing, but $wmb is up 1.15% today...nothing at all to do with china or oil.

2161 2018-11-19 20:05:33 Few thoughts on the current market environment.  Overcrowded trades are getting blown up and unwound all over the place.  Of course it started earlier this year with short vol, then EEM, and more recently it has been long oil, short nat gas, long FANG+.  I felt the FAANGs were..
2162 2018-11-19 20:05:29 In related but not rapist related news, did you see that Florida banned offshore oil drilling and indoor vaping in the same ballot measure? How the hell did THAT end up a thing?
2163 2018-11-19 20:05:16 I now know what it sounds like when a 275-gallon oil drum is cut in half with a sawzall. So I have that going for me.
2164 2018-11-19 20:05:08 This was beautiful.  Her smile could light up that room, and thats a big room!!!
2165 2018-11-19 20:05:08 Changing a car light bulb in a dimly lit supermarket car park and getting covered in oil (because the bloody things ALWAYS go in pitch black / nighttime of course). Living my best life.
2166 2018-11-19 20:05:04 I put on way too much beard oil today :(
2167 2018-11-19 20:05:01 Corten steel retraining wall. Really looking good with this house. Looking forward to the spring phase. Picture this with oil and stone driveway, concrete pathway and a full native revegetation. #ShineOnDesign

2170 2018-11-19 20:04:40 I’d pay good money for new flat cars with new loads (logs, pipes, oil drums, etc.) and I’m hoping that they rerelease it soon, but with Bachmann’s new releases, they’re very different from one’s expectations.
2171 2018-11-19 20:04:39 Obama supported the Iran deal. France and Europe loved this deal as they needed a source for cheap oil. Trump put America first, ended the deal. Europe loved Obama, as they raped the US on trade tariffs and military funding while Obama apologized for America’s behavior.
2172 2018-11-19 20:04:35 Smart people know this is partisan political nonesense.
100% rabid anti trump Democrats or Republicans are just fine to run and staff investigations.

2173 2018-11-19 20:04:32 gas prices are high in midland because of...wait for it...THE OIL INDUSTRIES!!! Hence why it’s cheaper...everywhere else.

2180 2018-11-19 20:03:52 Business model, bypassing independent venues leads to bad behaviour and outcomes for general public whether our health care system, prescription rates, MF boondoggle, or oil spills.  These mistakes cost more than regulations, time for reform. #nlpoli
2181 2018-11-19 20:03:20 Hey @realDonaldTrump what’s the timeline on legalizing medical marijuana if you in fact plan to do so? Lots of very sick kids out there could use that very helpful and non-psychoactive CBD oil! A lot of good people are suffering!
2182 2018-11-19 20:03:10 They tried to hit oil again today to help our very sick economy but crude shook it off.

2185 2018-11-19 20:02:51 Hello again Matthi, thank you for your patience. We fully understand and appreciate your point. The matter is firmly on our agenda to find suitable alternatives to palm oil.

2194 2018-11-19 20:02:09 Tae called me like gang, they just smacked for 2 hunchos on the oil change
2195 2018-11-19 20:02:09 now you care about oil? really? you absolutely had years to show your concern. you had anti oil persons in your gov at the beginning of your tenure. @RachelNotley @NDP @SohiAmarjeet  Your actions speak louder than your words every will.
2196 2018-11-19 20:02:02 NZ electricity prices will skyrocket higher when Natural gas prices increase, due to short sighted oil gas exploration ban.
Wind and solar generation is not reliable, not grid friendly, also very expensive.
More Hydro is the way to go, IMO.
2197 2018-11-19 20:01:52 Thank you for your inquiry, would you mind sending us a DM so we can send you some info about our Palm Oil use?
2198 2018-11-19 20:01:50 Forcing change isn’t necessary. If oil and gas aren’t being used, they will die a natural death. No need to euthanize. That is a extremist course of action. It would be devastating to millions of Canadians. Potentially economic suicide.
2199 2018-11-19 20:01:49 Sooo I’m gonna need to change my oil in my truck soon and I was so used to paying $20 with my car, tf now I have to pay more than $60 
2200 2018-11-19 20:01:48 In ten years, we will be able to reduce our reliance on oil so that even if the oil price falls to $5/BBL, it will not impact our economy. We have a long road ahead but nobody is tackling the tissue yet because there is no political incentive to do so.

2202 2018-11-19 20:01:18 Okay J. What is going on that you need to kick 25/7 I’m just trying to get my oil changed and not jump 
2203 2018-11-19 20:01:15 Your reasoning seems sound, though it's odd to see JNK making three consecutive new lows when both oil and SP500 are trading above last week's lows.

2207 2018-11-19 20:00:44 They’re all short pipelines. Line 3 was the only decent one. That’s a shitty line as well. USA pays dick for our oil. AB is getting hosed.
2208 2018-11-19 20:00:42 Venezuela got to where it is today because Hugo Chavez expropriated every private business, including the cash cow for Venezuela, the oil industry. He then fired every oil executive who disagreed with him and replaced them with govt officials ...
2209 2018-11-19 20:00:41 Went to my friends house to change my oil. Started it back up and the oil all poured out so we went out to get stuff to fix it. Then on the way back my friends cars ball joint blew and now we're at a junk yard. Mondays amiright.

2218 2018-11-19 19:59:55 So US law bars foreign campaign contributions so foreign companies don’t have undue influence but big oil and big drug companies in the US can donate wildly without influence 
2219 2018-11-19 19:59:47 This seems to have very little to do with protecting marine environments or preventing the collapse of wild fisheries. More subsidies to commercial fish farming and the oil and gas industries? @GeorgeMonbiot
2220 2018-11-19 19:59:40 As the benchmark price decreases so will revenue going to the federal purse. Because it is a gradual process, the government will now implement a separate program that replaces the lost revenue from oil with other initiatives.
2221 2018-11-19 19:59:33 I hope you can get some information in QP from the government on the Newfoundland oil spill; Husky Oil and the regulator don't appear to be responding to questions.

Oil price US$/BBL
June 2 2014 = 105.60
Jan 15 2015 = 43.14
May 29 2015 = 60.47
Aug 17 2015 = 45.96
Jan 11 2016 = 27.16

Between Jan 2011 and July 2014, crude oil prices were consistently higher than $100bbl hence the economic growth of that period.
2224 2018-11-19 19:59:17 But he didn't, really; he tried to get us to reduce our dependency on foreign oil--had he succeeded, so many geopolitical disasters could have been avoided; to accept & deal w climate change.  HE negotiated the release of the hostages in Iran, not the callous, lying Reagan.

2232 2018-11-19 19:57:58 Then visiting friends in your car using oil and gas may not be good.

Remember what it is you purport to be doing: you're supposed to be giving an explanatory reduction of moral goodness in non-moral terms.
2233 2018-11-19 19:57:53 For J&J we can measure if we shifted intent, or created long term brand resonance. The step from there to getting people to pick up our baby oil in Walmart is a bit harder. We are using Agent Based Modeling to get to that.
2234 2018-11-19 19:57:40 The exist but you can’t hear them because the squeakiest wheel gets the oil and the fanatics are taking all the attention. The moderates are becoming dems. Think about that. They are so repulsed by the RNC they are becoming Democrats. I guess a welcome home is in order.

2237 2018-11-19 19:57:21 Maybe in an alternate universe - YOUR grandchildren will be fighting wars over oil - but I highly doubt we would ever get near that here.  With the advances in solar, in batteries (Tesla) etc...the vast majority of the country will be off of oil long before a war ever happens!

2242 2018-11-19 19:56:32 Its not liberalism. Liberalism was the 20's; 1920's. The political compass today is wallstreet, big oil, quantity, finance capitalism and moral bankruptcy. There is no coherence to any of it.
2243 2018-11-19 19:56:25 As someone else noted, the oil and gas represent individuals who work in that industry donating to him, not pac money from the industry.  As for bills, often provisions are added by other side that are untenable. Ur list deserves more research, seems somewhat disingenuous.
2244 2018-11-19 19:56:22 Annoyed I tried to get a oil change & the fucking line long as shit

2251 2018-11-19 19:55:54 The problem we have is that our government including past govts have failed to diversify the economy in a sustainable way. Atiku plan did not address the issue of low oil price benchmarking which would have clued us in on how he intends to reduce overreliance on oil.
2252 2018-11-19 19:55:54 oil: changed
2253 2018-11-19 19:55:48 @POTUS Venezuela may want to increase the production of they’re oil to mitigate they’re hyper-inflation.
2254 2018-11-19 19:55:47 For now. Soon the @EPA will take its protections away and we can all hike by oil wells in a year. 

Won’t that be lovely? Camp in the shade of an oil derrick?

Or maybe you’d like to drink water that burns? We could do some fracking. 

National Parks are treasures.

Protect them!
2255 2018-11-19 19:55:46 It's further away today than it was on the 18th of September 2014, what questions are they?

Our currency? 
EU membership?
Over reliance of oil?
Whisky that doesn't belong to us?

I can think of many others too.
2256 2018-11-19 19:55:19 I do too.  If one reads on last global ccy system transition, there r numerous credible reports quoting the Shah of Iran as saying "If you want to know why we're raising oil prices fr $3 to $11/bbl, go talk to Henry Kissinger."  Ie Last time it was oil that was made "very big"
2257 2018-11-19 19:55:16 I heard you have CBD oil?

2263 2018-11-19 19:54:22 Unpopular opinion, charcoal face washes (esp foaming) are bullshit. Any sulphate cleanser is gonna strip you of oil and if you're normally dry you'll get drier, if normally oily your skin will produce even more sebum.
Cream/gel/balm/oil cleansers and a flannel are where it's at.
2264 2018-11-19 19:54:17 I guess that nasty oil spill wasn't bad enough as some species survived. Sure have to wonder what Gulf fishermen think about this.

2272 2018-11-19 19:53:27 Data is like raw oil - useless, until refined. You need to refine it into structured data, training data - that's the fuel for AI :)
Just like oil 200 years ago, people didn't see value until they discovered how to process it.

2275 2018-11-19 19:53:10 Martin - Well spoken sir. Problem is #Trudeau literally doesn’t care as his “vision" is phasing out oil production.
Every economist, Bank CEO and industry leader has told him exactly what you just said, and yet he smiles and says the future is renewables
2276 2018-11-19 19:53:10 My BK takeout while I'm sitting here waiting to get my oil changed would disagree ... 
2277 2018-11-19 19:53:03 Once it was hydrogenated fat in everything, now palm oil - it’s even in Nutella
2278 2018-11-19 19:53:02 They all just need to drop oil and chill to the beats. It's art, even the name has a different meaning to each. 
2279 2018-11-19 19:52:57 truth!
2280 2018-11-19 19:52:55 Most soy (between 70-88% of the total grown globally) is actually fed to animals who are then eaten by humans. The majority of the rest is used for soybean oil, not other food products e.g. tofu. It's not vegans who are driving deforestation for soy!
2281 2018-11-19 19:52:54 I don’t tip the guy that changes my oil. Lawn companies aren’t tipped. Personal trainers don’t get tipped. You pay for the service provided. I understand it is how it is. I’m saying it’s wrong how it is.
2282 2018-11-19 19:52:53 Countries with abundant oil and gas are not going to bullied into the same standards as those without. That’s not fair and not realistic. Canada is only a tiny blip on the global radar.
2283 2018-11-19 19:52:42 Katy the scientist are spot on climate change is a real problem. The deniers are in League with mining, oil,gas & logging interest. It’s the greed of the industrialist in the world.
2284 2018-11-19 19:52:35 as long as you dont stick a frozen turkey in boiling oil youll be fine.  thats how those idiots burn their houses down.
2285 2018-11-19 19:52:29 Came in for an oil change leaving with no car
2286 2018-11-19 19:52:24 Can you name these supposed "snake oil" salesmen specifically? Who? When we accuse a community of "snake oil" we must state specifics associated with the claim, and then a clear explanation of why the treatment in question is "wrong"
2287 2018-11-19 19:52:17 Impressive collection David!. There is a recipe we usually make from the Simply Nigella cookbook, Its Linguine with Garlic oil and pancetta. cheap easy and filling! X

2290 2018-11-19 19:52:05 @Oreo I'm normally a huge fan, but I won't buy anymore of your products if you don't stop using not sustainable palm oil. #dropdirtypalmoil
2291 2018-11-19 19:51:58 The banks of Indonesia and #Malaysia are shocked– why PJSC #ROSBANK (a daughter of the French financial group #SocieteGenerale) shamefully hides from reconciliation of financial flows of 1 bil EURO (import of PALM oil) and does not conduct such reconciliation for more than3 years
2292 2018-11-19 19:51:51 He should have been put in an oil tank like he did to his kids!
2293 2018-11-19 19:51:49 NNPC is a cash cow for the elites. The rest of the world including SAUDI ARABIA are selling their national oil firms. Brazil did same to PETROBAS. We can't continue in this blind alley where only a few steal the much. Check out the house of representatives report on NEMA!

2295 2018-11-19 19:51:35 Given Trump’s pathetic legislative performance, even “policy” should be in quotes. Trump’s “policy” leadership comes down to letting oil & coal rewrite environmental rules & enabling the suspiciously homophobic VPOTUS free rein to prove to impose anti-gay discrimination.
2296 2018-11-19 19:51:34 You dont mean the snake oil milionaire salesman in the White House- right?
2297 2018-11-19 19:51:33 I do not add oil or water.  I don't even oil the pan. You can even make a drop type cookie out of them. :D
2298 2018-11-19 19:51:30 Avoid dairy, gargle warm salt  water after meals, take a bath with 1 cup Epsom salt, 1/2 cup baking soda and 10 drops of oil of choice, hydrate! should go to doctor because of chest! Good luck Scott  Hugs
2299 2018-11-19 19:51:22 It's still where the problem starts. Until you get better Hockey Ops people hired I'll bet this team is what it is and what it has been since Katz bought it. A loser.

2306 2018-11-19 19:50:41 Cooked 2 patties on Friday from Beyond Meat, but I won't be buying these any more. I have lost the taste for meat and these are close, from what I remember and were somewhat unappetizing. Plus, there's a lot of bad shit in these, protein isolates, Methylcellulose, canola oil.
2307 2018-11-19 19:50:40 got my tires rotated, oil changed, car detailed. ugh I wish someone treated me like I treat my car.

2317 2018-11-19 19:49:52 One More Request from Waste Connections: Please don't put motor oil or other liquid trash in your trash/recycling  polycarts. Customers recently placed oil in their recycling bins, and  the entire load of recyclables collected that day were ruined and went  into the land fill.
2318 2018-11-19 19:49:49 That's another discussion entirely and one that can't be addressed...it's his team.
2319 2018-11-19 19:49:45 so we were having a debate in government between the environment and oil companies and this one guy goes "animals are using plastic for accessories. have you not seen Happy Feet? that penguin is wearing a necklace!"

2322 2018-11-19 19:49:26 Use baby power. It makes the sand fall off, absorbs the oil/pollution, and makes your skin soft which stops the chaffing.

2332 2018-11-19 19:48:27 This your analysis is fake. How much crude oil in the world market when Jonathan resume office? How much was stolen under his tenure.
2333 2018-11-19 19:48:26 Great point. Our problem is that oil constitutes a major source of revenue so oil revenue has a great impact on the economy. 

When we adjust the 1999 oil price for inflation, it is not lower than that of 2015-2016.

2355 2018-11-19 19:46:34 The Sentry report said they accumulated luxury homes in Australia, Malaysia, Uganda, and Kenya, and enriched themselves through stakes in oil, gambling and private security joint ventures. International facilitators from Ukraine Turkey, Kenya, and China were involved.

2386 2018-11-19 19:43:32 “Service-ing”
“Oil change-y”
2387 2018-11-19 19:43:32 Lol. Smh. I used tea tree oil and it's peppery
2388 2018-11-19 19:43:32 $UWT finally Luke Raicher pays off. As he says "Patience.. oil is worth something"
2389 2018-11-19 19:43:31 I need new tires, oil change, carwashed, windshield fixed, allatttttttt 
2390 2018-11-19 19:43:26 I need an  oil change & that’s a must this week
2391 2018-11-19 19:43:20 So with iut any pipelines we have to sell our oil at 14/ barrel, losing millions a day, billions a year
2392 2018-11-19 19:43:17 ですよね。今はなんだかんだいって気に入ってますの...！
2393 2018-11-19 19:43:10 #7 with provolone, oil vinegar and oregano, lettuce tomato pickle jalapeños & a little mayo. It’s a lot but the flavor combination is worth it
2394 2018-11-19 19:43:09 Have you tried the magic of coconut oil? People swear by that stuff!
2395 2018-11-19 19:43:06 Thought I finished my BMW.. 100% put together and then it dumps a gallon of oil on my floor 
2396 2018-11-19 19:42:58 Promise all black women need is some coconut oil! why y’all stressin over make-up?
2397 2018-11-19 19:42:58 Shay whiskey and mana2eesh with vodka oil
2398 2018-11-19 19:42:51 great u
2399 2018-11-19 19:42:50 What should Canada logically do when it comes to dealing with Western Canadian Select Oil? #oilprice #canada #Canadianeconomy #Bloomberg #business
2400 2018-11-19 19:42:43 The effect of migrants on Tijuana is concentrated, more visible. Once into U.S nothing is fundementally different, just diluted across the country and less noticable.
2401 2018-11-19 19:42:38 Germany has no oil and depends on Greece & Portugal for winter vegetables
They now get free subsidized holidays in Greece & Russia provides them with gas below production costs while Putin drastically cuts Russian pensions
Germany is a welfare state living off slave labour #qanon
2402 2018-11-19 19:42:33 Tip a little eucalyptus oil in her lotion bottle .... mosquitos hate the scent
2403 2018-11-19 19:42:32 Baby oil?! No!
2404 2018-11-19 19:42:24 Oil of oregano
2405 2018-11-19 19:42:20 They really wanted your #oil this am.
2406 2018-11-19 19:42:19 I see the growth as one of the main questions. With instabilities arising, the oil prices and uncertanities tend to rise and make it even less attractive to buy such big planes if you are not putting 700+ souls into them.
2407 2018-11-19 19:42:19 hate this bc i am actually in the bath rn but its just epsom salts and lavender oil
2408 2018-11-19 19:42:15 Ya I'm curious too, how this will just go 'away'?? According to our commitments in #NAFTA we are required to sell 74% of our oil to the US at this discounted price - and then import oil to fill the gap if we need more... Alberta and all of Canada should be up in arms over this.
2409 2018-11-19 19:42:15 Honestly, despite the price, I wouldn't touch most of the crap made for men.

Shampoo/Body wash/Anointing oil - All in one product.

Little thought or differentiation is put into men's personal products.
2410 2018-11-19 19:42:06 Yeah and the Packers are doing the same thing as Standard Oil. But there did come a day when the oil monopoly got broke up, need that for US Beef NOW
2411 2018-11-19 19:42:04 All of this while a 6 foot tall lizardfolk climbed up to pour oil over this angry turtle in an attempt to free him.
2412 2018-11-19 19:41:56 Options:

1) Work on engine was not done properly.
2) Aliens abducted you and stole your oil.

I'm going with option 2. Remember you heard it here first when the repressed memories come back in 20 years! :)
2413 2018-11-19 19:41:55 That’s exactly what I said. He can use a diffuser and just stick his face over it. Eucalyptus & peppermint oil clear it all up. Then spearmint black tea with lots of honey and lemon. Dose vitamin C too.
2414 2018-11-19 19:41:49 Seriously, I hate the assault on Ousmane Dembele. Man's the future of Barca and football. The campaign to push him out is unreal, except Leo Messi, he has been the one who has won us most points this season. Suarez and discipline are like oil and water. fuck off fatty
2415 2018-11-19 19:41:47 Hmmm? With half of the money Lent out in Latin America to Venezuela that has to be repaid in OIL and now this id tracking System will China be the next Empire for the next Thousand years maybe? Hmmm?
2416 2018-11-19 19:41:47 Fuck this oil change is taking forever And I need to be at work lol
2417 2018-11-19 19:41:34 Thanks man! Incredible week!!!
2418 2018-11-19 19:41:32 #bodyshop can't believe you are on the list as abusers of palm oil products. Always held you up due to non testing on animals
2419 2018-11-19 19:41:17 But wasn't it being done via #PPP before it went sour? The reconstruction of Apapa Port roads also to be done now under some #PPP arrangement. Infact there were #PPP way back for many roads, etc under the military - crude oil for construction
2420 2018-11-19 19:41:15 I’m getting real tired of Western Simulator 2018 aka #RDR2 and it’s tediousness. If you have to take poop breaks and get oil changes for your cars in GTA 6 I’m going to be pissed. @RockstarGames
2421 2018-11-19 19:40:59 MASSIVE competition alert! We've teamed up with @willsveganshoes to bring you the chance of winning a £100 shoe voucher and 6 months worth of Coconut Merchant coconut oil. To win: follow both brands and retweet! #competition #win #giveaway #prize #winner #comp
2422 2018-11-19 19:40:54 Do you follow the directions otherwise, same water and oil added? (So it's a regular spice cake with additions instead of substitutions, in other words.)
2423 2018-11-19 19:40:53 It’s been the same fucking talking point during every losing streak for the past 10 (11? 12?) years!
2424 2018-11-19 19:40:44 Priceless
2425 2018-11-19 19:40:38 More on the Premier's new oil 'special envoy.' As chief of staff to the premier from June 2015 to Dec. 2016,  Brian Topp helped devise the disastrous 'carbon tax for social license' pipeline strategy that has completely failed Albertans. #ableg #abpoli #UCP #cdnpoli #CPC
2426 2018-11-19 19:40:27 ヴィルヘルムとあの眼鏡のにーさんとまた飲みたいなー
2427 2018-11-19 19:40:26 Come make me huff gun oil.
2428 2018-11-19 19:40:26 Is that the same oil patch CEO that increased production without pipeline capacity to accommodate it while at the same time knowing full well that the US fracking was creating a glut driving down demand and prices?
2429 2018-11-19 19:40:14 skin food!!! straight coconut oil. trader joe’s has a good hand balm as well
2430 2018-11-19 19:40:09 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
2431 2018-11-19 19:39:56 Or like most of us in the oil patch trying our hardest to provide for our families and working 84hrs a week when the work is available! Thank you to all the wives and girlfriends that stand by their men!!
2432 2018-11-19 19:39:43 Pepper mint oil on the temples and back of the neck does the trick as well as Vicks
2433 2018-11-19 19:39:28 snake oil salesman
2434 2018-11-19 19:39:24 This evening, writing has me learning how to lubricate a tungsten carbide wheel cutter with oil. Where has it taken you?
2435 2018-11-19 19:39:19 Crude-by-rail loadings at monitored terminals in Western Canada reached a record-high monthly average of 274,000 barrels a day in October, according to Genscape Inc. data. Canadian oil companies have said they seek to double those volumes by next year. Bloomberg
2436 2018-11-19 19:39:16 Do you ever cook without using at least a half bottle of olive oil? I'd like to see you make ANYTHING where olive oil is not an ingredient
2437 2018-11-19 19:39:04 Saw $2.28 today in Springfield near downtown. Still $2.48 in Heyworth EVEN THOUGH the gas/oil terminal is 2 miles from the gas station. Ridiculous!
2438 2018-11-19 19:38:36 Sonhei que eu tava grávida passando bio oil nas estrias do bucho
2439 2018-11-19 19:38:17 Yesterday I nipped my ends off, did a rice water rinse, a hot oil treatment and a clay mask for my hair #SelfCareSunday 
2440 2018-11-19 19:38:14 Wrong,  His comments are I don't believe them. It's congress that doesn't want to upset the oil allies...
2441 2018-11-19 19:38:12 If you're watching a gas station parking lot looking for vehicles to stop and someone gets out and cleans their vehicle completely, washes the windshield, pops the hood and checks the oil, all in the freezing cold without a jacket... they're stalling and have warrants lol
2442 2018-11-19 19:38:06 Za fawa is in zah BOok
2443 2018-11-19 19:37:39 Actually the truth is eluding you once again. Chevron’s court documents are part of their sham intimidation tactic and Roger is not doing any of this for his own benefit. But if you want to trust oil company that deliberately pollutes that’s your poor choice.
2444 2018-11-19 19:37:35 cheio de promoção na farmácia, tem até opção oil free, só trouxa cai nessa
2445 2018-11-19 19:37:28 Are you anywhere near where you can get Emergen C? That stuff is great. If you have a diffuser put eucalyptus & peppermint oil in it and breathe away. Gargle warm salt water and drink peppermint black tea (Bigelowe Plantation Mint) with lots of honey.
2446 2018-11-19 19:37:25 Dear new cooks: when oil gets hot enough, it bursts into flames all on its own. I used to think it needed a spark to catch on fire. It doesn't.
2447 2018-11-19 19:37:12 My hair is so soft roirrreeee coffee oil is the truth!!!
2448 2018-11-19 19:37:10  Dying!! 

I'm the same way. I took multiple doses of pure CBD with no noticeable effects. But, what dirty says makes sense, too. Much higher doses may be required. Also, I find CBD does have noticeable effects if I smoke it like in a strong indica, compared to ingesting oil.
2449 2018-11-19 19:37:00 Dear son of recession,
  Recall that in 2015 the masses came out amass to resist the PDP, because you promised change, the failed APC promised so many things knowing full well that the price of oil prices were decreasing and the dollar on the high.
  After the won the elections
2450 2018-11-19 19:36:53 Sorry—all the US funded Canadian environmentalists are currently working to stop oil sands oil from reaching tidewater. Until the next Tides cheque clears, there will be no faux outrage. Unless there are ducks involved?
2451 2018-11-19 19:36:39 Oil and water don't mix...period.
Leave it alone.
2452 2018-11-19 19:36:38 And in the hypothetical case that Oreo stop using palm oil (a thing which I agree on) I don’t want them to start using fat pork again, that’s why I want to know what other ingredient can be provided to them
2453 2018-11-19 19:36:30 What is so bad about no deal? We will have £39 billion to oil the wheels!
2454 2018-11-19 19:36:29 This man needs a mirror to reflect his words. I mean. This guy already shot an own goal, yet he still pours more oil into the fire wtf
2455 2018-11-19 19:36:27 Says the guy who defends @DLoesch in half of his Tweets. Did I say anything about "putting money into it?" Pretty sure you're the one who doesn't know what he's talking about. Go huff some gun oil. Thank you for your service, btw.
2456 2018-11-19 19:36:24 The issue is the nicotine addiction. Last week, I confiscated oil that was 50 mg. Not only is addiction and issue, but so is nicotine poisoning. It’s not a healthy alternative.
2457 2018-11-19 19:36:20 Never palm oil, look in peanut butter’s as well and only choose a brand with no palm oil
2458 2018-11-19 19:36:19 And running on the absolute best 2 stroke oil Rock Oil Synthesis 2
2459 2018-11-19 19:36:18 WCS oil, is like peanut butter, it has to be refined a special way to use it, refining it in Canada would boost the price, as we'd be selling the same standard oil as everyone else. So more money for Canada instead of sell it for $12/barrel, buy it back refined for $60+ (5x sale)
2460 2018-11-19 19:36:17 Let’s relinquish our dependence on foreign oil and become energy independent!!! Very realistic goal within a few years ... and cut their legs out from under the fuckers!! Let’s make America even better!

2464 2018-11-19 19:35:58 Realize we have much bigger fish, but asking an honest question here:  Oil is just over $50/barrel... so why are gas prices in LA still over 4 dollars a gallon?
2465 2018-11-19 19:35:54 After some @younglivingeo oil & a few deep breaths we stopped * grabbed lunch at @QuikTrip and came home

2466 2018-11-19 19:35:52 Dems have to flip the script & use GOP tactics. SLIPPERY SLOPE is one of their tropes. It works with *choice* A country that can tell you what u can do with your body CAN tell you what to do with your body. China forced abortion. NoKo injects motor oil into embryos of impure race
2467 2018-11-19 19:35:43 I bought an essential oil diffuser last week, and it arrived today. My life has been changed.

2471 2018-11-19 19:35:07 @FrankPallone Can you explain why you are opposing a Select Committee for a Green New Deal? Could it be that you have a direct conflict of interest? The residents of New Jersey should note that you have received $178,000 from PACs of oil, gas, and electric utility companies.
2472 2018-11-19 19:34:59 @TomTSEC Is there any way an inquiry can be started into Justin Trudeau being in collusion with multi-national or other sources that by blockading Western Canadian oil from foreign markets these sources are making billions of dollars by buying and reselling it on world markets?
2473 2018-11-19 19:34:50 Canada actually has some amazing green technology, that's why we import oil. We need global solutions though not provincial or federal taxes and tax credits. Instead of taxing Canadians I'd rather our government buy shares in green Canadian businesses.
2474 2018-11-19 19:34:43 You people did not say yes tree oil is peppery 
2475 2018-11-19 19:34:37 tonight we are burning the midnight oil
2476 2018-11-19 19:34:20 Rose oil / anointed rose oil
2477 2018-11-19 19:34:13 Oh crap! Bottle of @canavape oil fell off my lap and hit my wheelchair footrest and cracked the bloody bottle!
Yes bad language poured out of my mouth like never before!
2478 2018-11-19 19:34:12 About time. Now, will it be left there after the crisis is perceived to be over?
2479 2018-11-19 19:34:03 Did someone blame Muskrat for the oil spill yet
2480 2018-11-19 19:33:58 Took car for brake replacement & oil change to dealership. They found an oil leak & another leak. Estimates for 2 leak repairs: $1500. Took car to reputable neighbourhood garage in bus 50 yrs. They found no leaks! What would u do?Write letter to dealership owner? @cbcmarketplace
2481 2018-11-19 19:33:56 Dw if it all goes to 0. Stocks are crashing, Deutsche  Bank laundering scandal, oil market wobbling. It could all come down. I know i'll be hodling my crypto all the way through and out the other side. :-)
2482 2018-11-19 19:33:53 $oil update:

2485 2018-11-19 19:33:31 i need a oil change
2486 2018-11-19 19:33:28 Tullow oil reports it has been shipping 600 barrels a day to changamwe, Mombasa, Kenya. The Americans and Saudi's can pump 11 million barrels a day of the stuff. Is the party still on?..Should we still bring out the palm leaves and celebrate?
2487 2018-11-19 19:33:19 I'm sure the oil used was from the woman with the alabaster box and the one Sämùèl used in anointing David..
2488 2018-11-19 19:33:08 According to SIGAR, Afg military officers sell food, oil and weapons to Taliban in exchange for money. Taliban control 40-50% of Afghanistan, run between 400-500 drug labs, generating millions of dollars worth revenue per annum. Yet Trump finds it convenient to scapegoat Pakistan

2490 2018-11-19 19:32:53 Yeah it’s a different compound mixed
300 was mixed with a vegetable glycerin
500 is mixed with an mct oil
2491 2018-11-19 19:32:53 This is my LOL of the day, for some reason these letters to “mother” just crack me up.  You are too funny!!  Everyone is getting squirrel oil for Christmas 
2492 2018-11-19 19:32:52 If the shoe fits....as an example, Millennials have played a huge role in ensuring Canada’s oil remains landlocked, completely ignoring the $100M-per-day economic reality of that action. The game’s funny because it’s true.
2493 2018-11-19 19:32:51 Hmm, in 1990 the oil price doubled with the invasion of Kuwait. A similar event would trigger a recession today no matter where we are in the cycle. But there's no way the market is smelling it in advance...
2494 2018-11-19 19:32:46 I have to have synthetic oil not the regular oil
2495 2018-11-19 19:32:37 Well considering it takes 3-4 barrels of clean fresh water to produce one barrel of oil from the Tar Sands, in addition to the energy output of one barrel to create one barrel. Tar Sands really isn’t very economical.
2496 2018-11-19 19:32:37 I note David Davis and others in Oklahoma talking trade deals. Oklahoma home to fracking companies like Chesapeake Devon  Continental Resources. Brexit equals more oil and gas.
2497 2018-11-19 19:32:34 And getting more from services, manufacturing, solid minerals, education, agriculture etc because liberalisation.

How much is this so oil??? Less than N2trn per year. That's far less than what Brazil gets from the manufacturing & agric sector.
2498 2018-11-19 19:32:17 Fair to do so, they are so fragile. I don't know how to fix that.
2499 2018-11-19 19:32:17 I have heard cats don't like citrus scents - but I refuse to diffuse catnip essential oil! :)
2500 2018-11-19 19:32:08 I think that was exemplified in the Flames game when in the 3rd period the Flames were as much playing keep away in the O zone. #Oilers had no one to break up the speedy cycling and Flames just kept sending out fresh legs.
2501 2018-11-19 19:32:03 No. The purpose of society is that I can visit friends, in my car, using roads, oil, gas, to do so in safety and freedom.
2502 2018-11-19 19:32:01 Who made this list?? Coconut oil is good for them. It helps their skin, fur and joints. Same goes for eggs.
2503 2018-11-19 19:31:57 Serena Shim  reportedly murdered by Turkish State Police two days after exposing Turkey's dealing with ISIS by buying their oil and offering logistical support.
2504 2018-11-19 19:31:52 Only terrorists benefit from #JCPOA and sale of Iran''s oil. Iranian blue collars 're  in dire poverty. Many have not been paid their $85 monthly salary which is barely enough for 1 week. When they protest, they 're beaten and jailed

2505 2018-11-19 19:31:49 Labour isn’t much better. We have Jeremy Corbyn now trying to sell the snake oil of a “Jobs First Brexit”, whatever that is, and ignoring members of his own Party who overwhelmingly favour a #PeoplesVote.
2506 2018-11-19 19:31:42 Tickets for the state football game at Lucas Oil Stadium will be on sale in the Athletic Office on TUESDAY ONLY (no school Wednesday) from 8:00 AM - 2:00 PM. Tickets are general admission. Student and adult tickets are $15. Game time 2:30 PM CST/3:30 EST.
2507 2018-11-19 19:31:33 All of the national networks are bastions of conservatism. The U.S. is the largest producer of oil in the world and when this privately-held resource is threatened with a reduction in demand the networks begin screaming, "Your 401K is bleeding your retirement to nothing. Panic!"
2508 2018-11-19 19:31:32 Anybody know where I can find some lavender oil
2509 2018-11-19 19:31:29 Bout to go get an oil change lol
2510 2018-11-19 19:31:29 My neighbor just came back from Abu Dhabi, and he said Niger delta people should burn Abuja. Despite having large deposits of crude oil, we still wallow in poverty. The way he explained how they were generating income just made me weep for naija. See just get your visa.
2511 2018-11-19 19:31:20 Of course!
2512 2018-11-19 19:31:14 *presentation on personality types going on*

@KayeAnna88: “like olive oil?”
2513 2018-11-19 19:31:13 So not like peaceful harmless oil at all!
2514 2018-11-19 19:31:05 That's incredible. Company's priority is producing oil. Who makes the #environment a priority? These gaps in legislation are too wide to be coincidental! #nlpoli #OilPrice is the price of killing the #AtlanticOcean
2515 2018-11-19 19:31:02 And when he was not in control Dutch loses all sense of morality, like when he lift aether nearly to be killed in the oil factory
2516 2018-11-19 19:31:00 The Uber driver $16 per hr average before expenses is not sustainable. If you drive a car as much as cabs, you too will need to do at least an oil change a month($50) and two break jobs a year ($500 min per job) So do the math...
2517 2018-11-19 19:30:59 Doubt those in a major liberal city like Toronto care about oil revenue. Likely falling on deaf ears.
2518 2018-11-19 19:30:52 Because of course it is. Lol
2519 2018-11-19 19:30:51 We regularly here our major Canadian news outlets talk about the world price of a barrel of oil in their business updates.  The price of a barrel of Canadian oil should also be included in these updates to give a more accurate picture of that which directly affects us.
2520 2018-11-19 19:30:34 Hear this man telling his shorty get an oil change and I’m weak cause we really don’t take care of our cars 
2521 2018-11-19 19:30:31 Now I'm thinking about what my characters smell like, and the unfortunate reality is that most of them probably have a hint of B/O because although it's the future, the ship is too small to have a shower...Except the captain. She smells like geosmin and clean motor oil somehow.
2522 2018-11-19 19:30:29 California unites for all natural disasters. 

You say our forests are mismanaged? Look at how much these red states have cost our country: Cole ash spills in Georgia and North Carolina, red tide in Florida, Louisiana oil spills, North Dakota oil spills just for starters.

2525 2018-11-19 19:30:23 I'd argue their has been little difference between the two seasons but to each his own. Too many people confuse a lack of confidence with not trying hard and that is what we saw for much of '17-'18. Everyone has responsbility but they are who they are.
2526 2018-11-19 19:30:20 Common sense assumes that you dont want to be injured just because you gave minimal consent to a person. Do you give consent to a mechanic to ruin your car for a simple procedure of changing tires or the oil? No, you can sue for damages.

2529 2018-11-19 19:29:42 I said all along it’s just a stunt to get people into their shops (they still sell palm oil products, they’re just acting g like they don’t) - it’s a cheap grab at the environmental market, I’m sorry you got thrown under the bus.
2530 2018-11-19 19:29:21 Tried CBD oil a few times for anxiety. Not sure if it worked cause I would always get a killer headache.
2531 2018-11-19 19:29:10 Deep frying tends to dry out the turkey, so keep it moist by filling the body cavity with water before dropping it into the oil.
2532 2018-11-19 19:28:55 Can you imagine if we had pipelines and didn’t have to rely on rail to move oil? Can you imagine the trickle down benifits for most industries.
2533 2018-11-19 19:28:52 getting bella an oil change 
2534 2018-11-19 19:28:45 Oh how easily offended you RWFWs are!!! Guess what, Midnight Oil have had success making songs and campaigning on social justice issues for over 40 years.
It must burn your evil little heart knowing that people can have a social conscience and be successful.
2535 2018-11-19 19:28:42 People in Florida throw our hands up and say *of course its Florida*!
2536 2018-11-19 19:28:36 The point is that in a couple of decades, the US and Europe won't need or be able to obtain Saudi oil anyway - it's already past peak oil and is plagued by geological problems. Thereafter, Dark Ages human rights record of the House of Saud might become an issue for them #C4News
2537 2018-11-19 19:28:21 The Uber driver $16 per hr average before expenses is not sustainable. If you drive a car as much as cabs, you too will need to do at least an oil change a month($50) and two break jobs a year ($500 min per job) So do the math...
2538 2018-11-19 19:28:17 I bought coconut oil infused toilet paper, so anyone who says I've not 'made it' is bullshit. I am the queen of making it. Cocobutt

2540 2018-11-19 19:28:00 Can’t vape. Was told the oil was too sensitive to heat like it is left in a car which is where mine would be. Going to be trying gummies next month though hoping that will be a more portable solution.
2541 2018-11-19 19:27:47 Good comment Sharmine. I see Bibi with the backing of his US friends and Genie Oil are permanently annexing the Golan Heights ?.
2542 2018-11-19 19:27:46 I use it for my hair...i mix it with castor oil too

2545 2018-11-19 19:27:39 Couldn't agree more mate. I'm on a mission to simplify the industry, too many snake oil salesmen preaching nonsense #SAMSimplified
2546 2018-11-19 19:27:37 It’s in nearly everything... and isn’t only just called palm oil, it can be called a number of different things. Seems almost impossible to escape
2547 2018-11-19 19:27:36 Yall dont remember that story where the chics went to Mexico to get boobs and they put motor oil in the implants?? Man screw all that fake extra stuff!
2548 2018-11-19 19:27:32 Saudis are cowards. We had to save their bacon from Sadam in Gulf War 1.0. With all those weapons from us they still ran away when the enemy was at the door. They abandoned daughters and family in Kuwait. Of course the oil boys, the Bushes, saved them with our blood and money.
2549 2018-11-19 19:27:28 Very and not sure it's a word
2550 2018-11-19 19:27:22 Because desperate, suicidal people don't try every last resort (like smoking cannabis) before pulling the trigger, right? Alex, do you believe the climate change lit published by oil companies?
2551 2018-11-19 19:27:14 Rob, we don't often agree, but I mostly do here. 100% on effort. That's one significant improvement over last year IMO. Starting to believe the not good enough part, seems everyone has to be hitting on all cylinders to win. TMAC does have some responsibility as well
2552 2018-11-19 19:27:12 I didn't see this. Am shy 
2553 2018-11-19 19:27:09 Let's be alert: for those who actively support #Brexit, their fear of an #indyref2 #ScotRef in case Scotland becomes independent is a lot larger than their support of Brexit.
So, expect a coruscating chorus of #keich next time round as losing North Sea Oil will worry them deeply.
2554 2018-11-19 19:27:07 Why with the amount of oil they phfac out of them hills it might as well be. Ruining ground water and God knows What else.
2555 2018-11-19 19:27:05 Bruh I’m getting my oil changed and some guy is being so annoying he’s freaking out cause he gotta be at the golf course
2556 2018-11-19 19:26:53 .@USTreasury  sanctions Russia-born, So African national Vladlen Amtchentsev for  helping companies, already under US sanctions, to purchase fuel oil & gasoil for North Korea. The sanctions freeze any of his  assets/property in US jurisdiction & bar US business dealings with  him
2557 2018-11-19 19:26:52 Bacon cooked up in coconut oil
2558 2018-11-19 19:26:52 So apparently are some oil companies.
2559 2018-11-19 19:26:49 So i just got my oil changed and i keep my bud in my center console and the guy was like the rest of your keys are in the center console along with something i wish i could be smoking rn hahah oops
2560 2018-11-19 19:26:48 They have magical sex oil these days that causes tingles.
Or so I am led to believe.
2561 2018-11-19 19:26:47 I never said is okey to kill orangutans, what I meant before is that in the past oreo used fat pork to do their cream then they replace it with palm oil but due to the fact that this has several desadvantages other solution or ingredient must be found
2562 2018-11-19 19:26:38 The Khozas and  wedding are like oil and water they don't mix #TheQueenMzansi
2563 2018-11-19 19:26:38 I have Coconut Oil lying around here. What do you guys use it for ? #GirlsTalkZA
2564 2018-11-19 19:26:24 my hair is naturally suppppppper dry and voluminious, so i have to weigh it down with leave-in conditioner and argan oil, the coconut oil helps keep its loose curls tho, hope that helps!
2565 2018-11-19 19:26:22 Mm. Perhaps. [He swirls his thumb around the head of the man's cock.] Do you have uh... [Not oil... What was it? Remember the commericial...] Lubricant?
2566 2018-11-19 19:26:17 Every time Florida is in the news and I have an urge to mock Floridians, I remember that I am in Commiefornia and I should just stfu...
2567 2018-11-19 19:26:14 We don’t need oil!! Clink clink bitch
2568 2018-11-19 19:26:05 Teach me things like how to check my oil that way i can handle it when your not around.
2569 2018-11-19 19:26:03 But if "we" get something like oil or investment in "your" properties we will overlook a calculated,brutal murder of a US reporter and dual passport holder, cuz hey, we got something from the Saudis.
2570 2018-11-19 19:25:32 You need to do more research on Saudi's Capitalism and frictional Monarchy hegemony you alleged.
Even Russia the highest oil producer still maintain National Oil and Gas Corporation to today.
Nigeria need to achieve its diversification strategies before thinking of divestment.

Where is the ombudsman - OPEC?

2579 2018-11-19 19:24:30 @atiku is only interested in Nigeria oil that's why his center target is NNPC.
2580 2018-11-19 19:24:22 Just found out - most fish and chip shops fry in Palm Oil or beef dripping.  Is there any escape - how can it be avoided! — feeling sick
2581 2018-11-19 19:24:05 Averageness is being kind ;)
2582 2018-11-19 19:24:00 How is it not pettiness, is this an issue based campaign or is it bothering us? How does this concern us as Nigerians? Misplaced priorities, they've refused to invest their energy where it's most needed.
The logo's ain't even the same, look at it.
2583 2018-11-19 19:23:54 Bathe your hair with ah bottle of coconut oil
2584 2018-11-19 19:23:38 Let’s look at the most concerning fact that reared its ugly head after the Tkachuk incident: The Oil put Lucic on the top line for protection & he was boat anchor that held 97 & 29 down. Every time Lucic touched the puck, the play died & went the other way...
2585 2018-11-19 19:23:37 @FionaDecleorUK  TSV arrived today, not expecting it so soon thank you @qvcuk. Tried the magnolia oil, and prolagene cream, love it. Tomorrow will try iris oil and balm.  So glad ordered 2 more on advanced order!! X

2587 2018-11-19 19:23:35 I don’t suppose the protesters are too happy about the oil price going up either.  But have limited opportunity to protest in a way that impacts OPEC decisions.
2588 2018-11-19 19:23:28 Don't do the expected and buy beard oil or a beard trimmer for your man this Christmas, instead buy him a Jaguar SUV. I say don't buy any car that's made in Germany or France.  @lbc
2589 2018-11-19 19:23:27 Maybe I dont quite understand. But I know principles of economics and I know the oil is a commodity.

2592 2018-11-19 19:23:08 Coconut oil. It's the best oil for raking in the dark. 
2593 2018-11-19 19:23:01 I’ve had my truck for 6 years and today was the first time I changed my own oil...you can’t beat the feeling of a successful DIY project
2594 2018-11-19 19:23:00 I’ve applied coconut oil, it’s still paining me 
2595 2018-11-19 19:22:48 Gotta chuckle at the notion #Oilers aren't playing a full 60 mins but this is always the fallback from many media types & many fans. For the last time, this isn't an effort issue. They are trying, they just aren't good enough...it really isn't that difficult to comprehend.
2596 2018-11-19 19:22:47 why does literally everything contain palm oil or palm fat im finding it unavoidable
2597 2018-11-19 19:22:42 Try Shea butter or coconut oil.
2598 2018-11-19 19:22:26 hahahahaha i use coconut oil as a conditioner between treatments and use rosewater if my scalp burns 
2599 2018-11-19 19:22:24 I don’t know which woman needs to hear this, but you’re beautiful and please change your oil.
2600 2018-11-19 19:22:17 every time i take my car to get an oil change they really make me feel like my car is 0.2 miles away from blowing tf up
2601 2018-11-19 19:22:12 Is Chia done dissecting the Oil Kings yet?

And when will he dissect the Oilers?
2602 2018-11-19 19:22:09 Coconut oil and liberal tears?
2603 2018-11-19 19:22:09 Today is a little bit of a warmer day but man I can’t shake this chill. Hot shower needed pronto after this oil change.
2604 2018-11-19 19:22:05 Shred the socca in 4 tablespoons should come out the tops and get everyone is hot oil.

2606 2018-11-19 19:21:47 As horrible as this man's crimes are, I don't believe it is the state's right to choose who lives and dies.  I don't want my tax dollars to pay a state licensed executioner any more than I want my tax dollars to murder people in the Middle East for crude oil.

2612 2018-11-19 19:20:59 The ONLY time I respond w/ strong language is when people directly attack my own colleagues/friends. Either by calling them "snake oil" salesmen, or, very often, by unfairly claiming that their years of hard work on microbes in the brain + blood etc are all "contamination"
2613 2018-11-19 19:20:55 I'd be more concerned about the Oil spill from @HuskyEnergy.

Devastating day on no real new news. Plus, oil is up, and the 10 year is getting closer to 3%,..down from 3.25%.
Why are we tanking yet again?

2618 2018-11-19 19:20:34 When I roast a chicken, I basically do what Cora does and I also coat the chicken in oil, which holds moisture in and lead to the skin getting crispy.

Covering the chicken with chopped up lemon peels is also tasty.
2619 2018-11-19 19:20:28 U obviously don't understand how international oil market works...
2620 2018-11-19 19:20:23 The other day at work this dude came up to the counter and asked if we had joint juice (a dietary supplement for arthritis containing glucosamine and vitamin C) and I told him that the state had recently banned the sale of CBD oil
2621 2018-11-19 19:20:20 Overbought USD and higher oil/gas prices going into the winter, nothing to do with a strong Canadian economy or JT.
2622 2018-11-19 19:20:15 We were joking the province should put the counters that show how much money the Canadian economy is losing on the sides of oil tankers/trucks, not just billboards haha
2623 2018-11-19 19:20:10 see i even had to go and buy developer after sending out the poll on saturday! as long as you have the coconut oil and rose water for after, i say..... why not!!
2624 2018-11-19 19:19:52 One Thanksgiving my idiot exhusband decided to deep fry a turkey. The dumbazz plopped the frozen turkey in the boiling peanut oil. As you can imagine there was quite and explosion. Hence exhusband.
2625 2018-11-19 19:19:44 of course, but they have instructions to do it properly. Like, don't fry it when it's frozen. Don't fry it unless you made SURE that it's patted dry. Make sure you have a thermometer for the oil and for the bird.
2626 2018-11-19 19:19:36 You know you've fucked up if you have to resort to consuming castor oil
2627 2018-11-19 19:19:28 What does it matter if they receive any subsidies? Coal and oil do, quite a bit actually.
2628 2018-11-19 19:19:19 We have a snake oil salesmen Trump for a president

2631 2018-11-19 19:19:04 I'm tired and need to sleep but I will stay up for another 15 minutes to put tea tree oil on my face. @skin don't worry I got you boo
2632 2018-11-19 19:19:03 Hahaha spoken like a true snake oil salesmen. Not only will it cure all your problems, but you only have to pay the 38 dollars to find out if that claim is bs
2633 2018-11-19 19:18:56 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…

2636 2018-11-19 19:18:48 He deserves more than life in prison. The audacity of his mother to claim his deceased wife abused him!!! Hmm, he placed the babies in oil drums!!! There is a special place in hell for him....
2637 2018-11-19 19:18:43 Maybe this might be a great time to reduce the oil sent to Vancouver.
2638 2018-11-19 19:18:39 You’re arguing against a point nobody is making. To use your example, a woman working on an oil rig in a book or movie doesn’t require a narrative reason to be both a woman and an oil rigger. She just is.
2639 2018-11-19 19:18:36 This is about scoring a couple of points for #BCliberals friends in the oil & gas industries says @SChandraHerbert, they have endorsed big money for 16 yrs, they love foreign money donations #bcpoli
2640 2018-11-19 19:18:18 I don use oil taya 
2641 2018-11-19 19:18:14 For Nigeria, 5 million bb/d is impossible. Instead, focus on a sustainable 2.5m bb/d oil, uninterrupted natgas for local electricity generation, cooking, and export, and FOCUS ON DOWNSTREAM and SIDESTREAM industrial linkages. That's where more Nigerians will benefit.
2642 2018-11-19 19:17:33 mom just said no to buying oreos cos they use palm oil n it hurts but it’s what’s gotta be done 
2643 2018-11-19 19:17:16 I go with over achieve and then play to there abilities. No team with Mcdavid  should ever miss the playoffs unless they are surrounded by averageness...
2644 2018-11-19 19:17:15 So it is ok to support a government that murdered a US journalis as long as they  sell us oil and buys our arms. Especially if your son in law is in there pocket as they have braged.
2645 2018-11-19 19:17:07 How do you know he was wrong when the pipeline was never built? The merits of carbon taxes are supported by data from Canada and other countries -also by the Oil Sands corps that can't just pack up and leave Alberta like other multi-nationals. You aren't making a strong case.
2646 2018-11-19 19:17:05 literally what oil because i need this
2647 2018-11-19 19:17:03 Diversity in a group is proof of inclusion and fairness.  But lack of diversity isn’t proof of the opposite.  Just because 99% of roughnecks on oil rigs are men, does that mean they discriminate against women, or is it that most women aren’t interested in that type of job?
2648 2018-11-19 19:16:55 Mr Ahmed... Have got beard oil for u.
2649 2018-11-19 19:16:46 rawr how come I came to get my oil changed for my car and they told me it’s going to take a couple hours but if it was my dad they would say like half an hours 
2650 2018-11-19 19:16:36 Yes of course I will pray for you. If you message me I would love to send you an essential oil mix that I will make especially for you for helping you sleep. Made with love and prayers.
2651 2018-11-19 19:16:35 Japan is vulnerable to oil and raw materials imports, and wastes a lot of money on highways, 'bridges to nowhere', etc. especially via Keynesian fiscal policy.
2652 2018-11-19 19:16:25 BOY!! ZILELE ETRONGWENI!!

Did you know boiling water mixed with baby oil is hot enough to take your skin off?

2654 2018-11-19 19:16:19 Oil paint maybe...better u find out which brand and type paint and google...
2655 2018-11-19 19:16:14 I'd have to research that and get back to you sir. But just asking, isn't oil just oil?? Like a natural resource in the ground that comes out through complex engineering works. Is it a mystery that may never be understood??

2663 2018-11-19 19:15:07 Butter is about 80% fat, oil is 100%- next time you do this only use like 3/4 the amount of oil 
at worst they'll just be real flat and the color will be off I think!
2664 2018-11-19 19:15:01 MITI thought Jap autos couldn't compete with US and Euro autos. But also had other reasons e.g. autos would promote consumerism, and impose more costs like oil and iron ore imports, highway construction, etc. MITI wanted to promote rail and public transit instead.

2668 2018-11-19 19:14:54 @charliebighams I’ve just read the cooking instructions & I see Palm oil in the ingredients. So disappointed. Is it sustainable? It doesn’t say on my packet of salmon en croute that I was so looking fwd to on this cold, miserable night! Can’t you use rapeseed oil instead?
2669 2018-11-19 19:14:53 My dad swears by tea with honey and peppermint oil, but I usually get my colds in my sinuses instead of lungs so I cannot confirm if it is effective. Oil of oregano is also good for lungs (rosemary for sinuses) and a crapton of garlic

2671 2018-11-19 19:14:40 There’s something empowering to not only be the youngest person in a room, but the only woman in a room full of men. I am so proud of myself for making a name for myself in the oil and gas industry which has been a male dominated industry for centuries.
2672 2018-11-19 19:14:40 ......would the oil be in YEG W/O Katz? #steppedup
2673 2018-11-19 19:14:22 i’m still unbelievably gagged over Aquaria’s oil spill mermaid look from season 10 ep 7 my god is she talented
2674 2018-11-19 19:14:09 Groundnut oil stew? Anyway I can't remember the details, but I'm sure we've established that your opinions on food are to be taken lightly.
2675 2018-11-19 19:14:04 You may get oilier cookies that are a little flatter 
did you use the same amount of oil as butter?

2677 2018-11-19 19:13:54 getting my car’s oil changed at a new place and i guess it comes with a wash - dude had to come find me and tell me they can’t clean the interior of my car because it’s filled to the brim with DSA stuff 

“we could clean...the drivers seat and floor? that’s about it” 
2678 2018-11-19 19:13:51 Maybe go into a little more detail with what went wrong here? 
1. Turkey not thawed and dry. 
2. Too much oil in pot, which caused overflow onto direct flame. @altonbrown how else can we help improve this tweet?
2679 2018-11-19 19:13:46 Yes you can
Steps
Very hot oil
Put in plantains
When the plantains are getting deeper in color 
Put in the eggs in one corner

Or you can spread the eggs all over the plantain

2681 2018-11-19 19:13:30 Just stop wasting $ on oil and LNG, both are more expensive than wind or solar
2682 2018-11-19 19:13:27 Maybe the oil for frying it was the oil David was anointed with

2687 2018-11-19 19:12:20 What's wrong with oil? That's my fuel of choice

2690 2018-11-19 19:12:06 wig? I used vegetable oil
2691 2018-11-19 19:12:06 Problem is palm oil is not good for human consumption and is used because it is cheap and nasty ! Why ?
2692 2018-11-19 19:12:01 lol, okay. Keep making those "spiritual" connections with people you have no real connection to and whose situations have no direct reflection on your current circumstance. You'll be treading water for a long time to come on that snake oil.
2693 2018-11-19 19:11:53 Scott, can we fight back against one of the biggest hypocritical  situations ever?As Quebec opposes pipelines Saudi  oil arrives up  the St. Lawrence and we ay $60 for it.Can this country be honest for once?
2694 2018-11-19 19:11:52 Free oil change for life & a bad bitch for life... seems like a win win
2695 2018-11-19 19:11:52 Can this also include state and federal agencies? 

If so, I could probably afford rent and regular oil changes for my 1998 hand-me-down car. #chroniclife #disability

2697 2018-11-19 19:11:40 If I may ask pls the Govt has  said before that it has deregulate  the down stream sector by removing the fuel subsidy but why it is that up to now the Oil marketers are still been paid fuel Subsidy 
Some one should educate me pls
2698 2018-11-19 19:11:40 Hahaha see gun short, like u own oil well abi
2699 2018-11-19 19:11:40 And how fire is going to effect mining and drilling restrictions? Most of California oil is offshore anyway and the state has ban on drilling
2700 2018-11-19 19:11:23 Blacked out, vista roof, Bluetooth Sync, heated leather seating are a few of the options on this good looking automobile. Checked out, oil changed and ready for delivery!
2701 2018-11-19 19:11:18 Build our own refineries and stop exporting the raw oil!!!

2704 2018-11-19 19:11:03 That’s actually what we always do.  We split the squash and oil it and roast it until it’s soft first. I didn’t realize that wasn’t a step on the recipe. We’ve used a lot of similar recipes over the years. I sent that one because it’s the basics and you can easily adapt.
2705 2018-11-19 19:11:01 Well... because he is a slut, I doubt he is doing this for money... he seems to be doing it just to be liked by the cool kids...
2706 2018-11-19 19:10:59 Great piece of engineering. Too bad it's such a big polluter. Relatively little progress in reducing air pollution from shipping has been made in recent years. Burning crude oil et cetera.
2707 2018-11-19 19:10:53 So where will this $$ come from if not from oil? Alberta funded most transfer payments for decades.
2708 2018-11-19 19:10:49 Perhaps, but I see a more white people wanting to get in on same deal. They can't actually not be white but denouncing "those other white ppl"  gives them eligability into the club. They can claim being victims of "white thought" which they have now denounced
2709 2018-11-19 19:10:44 We have a plan. It’s called oil & gas production dominance.
2710 2018-11-19 19:10:41 Premier @RachelNotley is appointing an Energy Upgrading Unit to develop a strategy to close the oil price differential. #YYC #ABleg @GlobalCalgary

2715 2018-11-19 19:10:11  - You won’t be allowed in London with that. Suggest you get the exhaust checked, think you might be burning oil 
2716 2018-11-19 19:10:10 So how screwed am I if I use oil instead of butter

2724 2018-11-19 19:09:00 It's a looting plan. He already said he'll sell the national oil company - we know what happened to the last one he sold. His campaign DG said hell share money from the Treasury, unlike the current president.
2725 2018-11-19 19:08:58 They rub oil on their camera
2726 2018-11-19 19:08:53 To be fair, last year was a one-off and so was 2016-17. This team will finish with more than 78 points this season and may even sneak into the playoffs b/c their division sucks. However, that doesn't change the fact the roster is a joke.

2728 2018-11-19 19:08:38 Audi’s are fun until your first service is $1400 for oil changes and diagnostics.
2729 2018-11-19 19:08:27 (2/2) This leads to false hope with patients and unfortunately there ARE many snake oil salesmen out there. Ignoring that and ignoring the importance of good (i.e. often slow) science to bring solutions to patients is not helping anyone.

2733 2018-11-19 19:08:07 There’s non-pyschotropic CBD oil, too! We are thinking about it :/
2734 2018-11-19 19:08:00 *dies laughing* - That is a very serious situation. I can offer you Oil of Olay, or medium grade sandpaper, or a new life in a foreign land under a pseudonym. Also under a cowl, in a monastery, probably. Sandals de rigeur. I'd take the Oil of O..
2735 2018-11-19 19:07:58 Please don't just follow lets do business bring those contracts let's sign biz deals, you might be working in a company link me up to come and buy your company scraps, batteries, waste spent oil etc
2736 2018-11-19 19:07:58 One big criticism is that both they and the company that banned the advert bank with HSBC who also have links to palm oil plantations.  They're also only removing palm oil from their own brand products.  Presumably they'll still be stocking other brands that do contain it.
2737 2018-11-19 19:07:53 Amin bro
2738 2018-11-19 19:07:48 Yes. I want to hear the answer. Because this is as easy as honesty and effective anti-graft measures to fight corruption in the oil sector. The KSA sell nothing other than oil and I dont think they are achieving it by rocket science.
2739 2018-11-19 19:07:43 I am exercising my right to free speech to say that you are a racist shill and a charlatan, who wants other lazy minded individuals to be stupid enough to fund your snake oil bigotry. I am standing by my belief and have strength in my resolve not to believe your poison.
2740 2018-11-19 19:07:38 Casually robbed a farmer and his Border collie would’nt stop attacking me. You werent there but it had to be done to get those $3 and some snake oil. Now I feel like that dentist poacher. 

This games fucks with your heart.
2741 2018-11-19 19:07:35 They steal our oil, minerals and other natural resources.  Systemically caused corruption and undermining in the political spectrum. While also labeling Africans as uncivilized, and not giving us credit where it’s due.

2751 2018-11-19 19:06:38 @Kittie Shyne You can use a food­ grade citrus bergamot or cinnamon oil if you'd like to (Silver Cloud Estates and doTERRA make excellent products), but remember you won't be getting the EGCG if you don't also use green tea, which is another key polyphenol.
2752 2018-11-19 19:06:26 Good for Mondelēz Int.. More companies need to part ways with palm oil companies that lead to deforestation and habitat destruction, or palm oil all together.

2754 2018-11-19 19:06:12 In Stratford getting my oil change and this woman next to me was dead ass glancing over at my phone while I’m sending a text. Like not even trying to hide it, she was straight up peeking over and lowering her glasses to see what I was doing. Who tf does that..? 
2755 2018-11-19 19:06:10 @BrendanSchaub What brand CBD Oil do you use?
2756 2018-11-19 19:06:07 Murphy’s law states that anytime you are about to pull into a 15 min oil change place, at least two cars pull in right before you do.
2757 2018-11-19 19:06:03 After independence, we must make our tax laws work for us against these companies.
Not like WM giving tax breaks to oil companies.

2760 2018-11-19 19:05:46 Yes, just before pouring vegetable oil to the fields and lighting it all up. That'd give a lovely smoked cheese flavor. Maybe driving some pigs to the fields too?
2761 2018-11-19 19:05:45 There must be something that can give off enough oil to fry some other thing.
2762 2018-11-19 19:05:44 No problem. DeSantis will ignore the peoples vote get his financials supported by big oil and set up Florida to be further drowned in the rising sea
2763 2018-11-19 19:05:41 I’ve never even tried one! But I did cut Nutella out when I found out they used palm oil.

2771 2018-11-19 19:04:39 Question for farmers, what are your thoughts on the Alberta gov’t pushing to get more oil moving on rail. Premier has said ag would still get priority first and then oil and gas. This is in response to really low oil prices right now. #westcdnag
2772 2018-11-19 19:04:30 I am sorry. I run into that all the time - They have believed the lies told for over 80 years - They are gullible and this is exactly what the lying medical complex wants, confusion. If I can help, let me know. Wishing we could sneak the oil into her for a month and show them all
2773 2018-11-19 19:04:24  I hate getting my oil change
2774 2018-11-19 19:04:16 I got my oil changed last month at sparkle and today my damn car was ticking so I’m mad af I’m calling them because I was going right up there after I got off when I called they ask where was I and they came to my job

2777 2018-11-19 19:03:57 it’s really good at penetrating deep in your skin, and maybe your cleanser is drying it out too? don’t use it there, if you’re wearing make up trying rubbing oil on that spot and just scrubbing it off with a washcloth for now until it gets better
2778 2018-11-19 19:03:57 Jen Kirkman won't be happy with @Ocasio2018 until she starts an illegal war for oil.

2781 2018-11-19 19:03:32 @IcelandFoods we should name and shame all the companies / products that contain palm oil. There has got to be an alternative #RangTan
2782 2018-11-19 19:03:31 Of course you would, contrary to what Westminster want you to believe in how Scotland receives more income then it provides we all know it’s BS. Oil, whisky,fishing(salmon) water, renewable energy and loads more.....we are an export country and very self sustaining
2783 2018-11-19 19:03:30 We sell for $16 and buy for $60.No new pipelines and Saudi oil tankers roll up the St. Lawrence.Would this happen anywhere else?

We all have a choice. Be a part of the solution or be a part of the problem. Fossil fuels are damaging earths climate.
2787 2018-11-19 19:02:37 Point is you are not going to see 100bl oil again, ever.  Many sector jobs automated and obsoleted, not coming back again.  The party is over.
2788 2018-11-19 19:02:33 oh ok! disregard the last tweet, so this is probably bc of winter or if you have your heat on, I’ve had this issue before and exfoliating didn’t help me at all either! the only little bit of relief I had was using oil :/ but not coconut! do you have another kind? maybe olive?

Coconut, despite it’s strong scent, helps hair grow, makes best moisturizer and great taste when you cook with it. 
Olive oil also is light weight, great moisturizer and perfect for bath and applying on skin
2830 2018-11-19 18:58:55 Andp took office amidst a recession and crash in oil price that started under PC watch, that's a indisputable fact. Nobody could've stopped that. They did fairly well using stimulus spending to guide AB quickly out of recession, austerity would've made things worse #abpoli

2835 2018-11-19 18:58:21 You can argue oil&gas are bad for environment but not for the state and certainly don't cause poverty. Their plan will lower state revenue at same time as the state is increasing spending on clean energy infrastructure. Three guesses where the money is going to come from.

2848 2018-11-19 18:57:05 Tumbling oil prices. 6 weeks of falling oil prices of 20%, $86 down to $67. So why hasn't it hit the garages yet? I keep saying it. Shop around motorists!
2849 2018-11-19 18:56:57 This is so true I think he did the opposite seeing the oil price
2850 2018-11-19 18:56:55 If the oil sector works well in all transparency and accountability  90bn$ over 5years is achievable. I dont think the administrators of the KSA or Qatar go about borrowing money for budget funding, and even if they do it must be for a capital investment.
2851 2018-11-19 18:56:44 LMAO. yeah he was like u need more oil in your car and i was like “well can it like wait” and he was like “um no....” lmaooo
2852 2018-11-19 18:56:42 much better tweet than crude oil and destroying lives. I mean if a citizens looses a few thousands $$, it s the equivalent of hundreds of thousands  $$$$ for the rich.

2855 2018-11-19 18:55:41 Thank you! I am sure that it's in your manual, but is there a recommended number of hours of use for oil change? Is that something that a user/consumer can do themselves?

2857 2018-11-19 18:55:33 Hence the need for equipping with skills that help you acquire resources.. I think you can see how much oil are in agreement with the statement. Thank you for the contribution
2858 2018-11-19 18:55:26 This surely reflects a correct perception of future demand, otherwise more effort would go into the necessary exploration and development. In other words, oil and gas companies are perfectly aware of what's coming.
2859 2018-11-19 18:55:10 Oil&gas are 1/3 of state revenue so they've helped fund all of NM's social programs, including medical and education. They've also created a lot of NM's high paying jobs. Grisham/Heinrich want 50% by 2030 and 80% by 2040, artificial targets that will crush NM's economy.

WHATS REASONABLE ABOUT THAT?
2904 2018-11-19 18:50:58 I kid you not, I’m getting a pedicure and they’re using extra virgin olive oil on me....
2905 2018-11-19 18:50:54 Yes, but that would delay further progress in their mission. Every year of delay, is 100's of billions in revenue for oil companies and clients. A fraction of that is all it takes to undermine entire alt energy businesses like $TSLA.

2907 2018-11-19 18:50:50 Foreal lol I'll be sampling oil on top a 18 wheeler just getting fucking drenched 
2908 2018-11-19 18:50:44 Looks good to me
2909 2018-11-19 18:50:42 There's no need for a Royal commission. The facts a plain & the oil companies don't care who buys their fuel as long as everyone is buying! The incentives are bogus & we should all steer clear of Coles or Woolies stations!
2910 2018-11-19 18:50:38 It gives us the authority to act in his name. Spiritual ordinances. Such as conformations giving the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands. Healing the sick and afflicted with consecrated olive oil. Temple ordinances. Many more sacred things.
2911 2018-11-19 18:50:31 I'm 100% fine with his positions, even if I don't agree with them all, in part because I look at the whole package--including whether he can win. Also--how is it that a guy who refused ALL pac money is #2 in taking from "oil and gas?"
2912 2018-11-19 18:50:29 a customer spilled patchouli oil all over my hands after i got done smoking & getting stoned & now i smell like i've been at a 3 day phish show
2913 2018-11-19 18:50:28 Andrew... Start talking about OIL production!  What your going to do when in office... Lower taxes?
Transmountain?

Come on give us something to get excited about
2914 2018-11-19 18:50:19 99 Impreza. It runs but burns a lot of oil and only seems to be getting worse. x.x
2915 2018-11-19 18:50:16 Is it really weird that my coconut oil offers me confirmation on the temperature of my home?

If the coconut oil is:

solid- no. it is too cold!

semi-solid- might be time for a sweater or blanket.

liquid- yesssss! why can't it be this way all the time? 
2916 2018-11-19 18:50:07 Envoys will work with industry to look at strategic short-term fixes to oil price differential.
2917 2018-11-19 18:50:02 Genie Energy = Rothschild

Congress = Genie Energy
CFR = Congress

Oil & Gas = Golan Heights
Pipeline projects = Syria

2920 2018-11-19 18:49:52 The insurance industry is simple, if insurer's payout more claims, than more premium will be collected from the pool. (i.e. we will both pay higher premiums) The current practices where trucks or rail transport oil, much higher risk than pipelines, which is safer & more practical
2921 2018-11-19 18:49:48 Also of note, it's not legally regulated right now so depending on where you get it it could have no cbd at all, or worse, synthetics. If you're interested, i recommend johnnyapplecbd vape carts and lazarus naturals for oil
2922 2018-11-19 18:49:41 There is a viral bug going round so unless you have multivoloured phlegm a doctor won't see you.  Dose of covonia with quite warm water and down it. VAPO RUB on feet with socks, Olbas Oil in cool mist humidifier.  Gargle child's paracetamol to help throat.
2923 2018-11-19 18:49:41 definitely back in oregon.. picked up an ounce and two grams of oil for $80 bucks
2924 2018-11-19 18:49:40 I always tell them, "No blood for oil!" but they keep calling back.

2926 2018-11-19 18:49:36 If CNY oil/commodities works, they will be fine.  If it does not, they will have the Current Acct Deficit-driven BoP crisis you are looking for.  This is why I am on record saying CNY oil has the potential to be a game changer.

2928 2018-11-19 18:49:33 I feel like Muddy Cup Buddy, I got that oil on me..
2929 2018-11-19 18:49:26 Remember the oil had been running out since the 80's. Still flowing! Yes it is a fallacy Scotland more than pay's its own way. If you believe the British state acts for the good of Scotland at a deficit you really are naive.
2930 2018-11-19 18:49:26 I guess the saudi oil money found his way to our paranoid block Queen Sibel
2931 2018-11-19 18:49:25 can barely afford my oil change but what makes it worse is that I’m online shopping WHILE waiting for this change to be done 

I loathe myself
2932 2018-11-19 18:49:25 Cue Oil Crisis.
2933 2018-11-19 18:49:23 So Alberta needs to keep their oil/gas in Alberta and make products themselves instead of sending it elsewhere...

Remember when they hated being told they need to diversify their economy? Those were fun times, weren't they? #abpoli #cdnpoli
2934 2018-11-19 18:49:13 @Thom_Hartmann If it is true--as Bloomberg says--that Putin, trump and Bin Salaman now control more oil that OPEC---that explains a lot of the behavior of each of them and the overlapping dynamics

2946 2018-11-19 18:47:57 In case anyone missed the news there was a huge storm raging at the time and the highest waves on the planet were blocking any attempts at reigning in the oil being spilled. Please do some research before posting

2962 2018-11-19 18:45:17 Hang on to your longs...The Saudis have started to export a lot less to the US and give it 30-40 days it will start to show in the inventories. Plus OPEC is very upset with Trump and oil price action and they will cut. We will see 63 in WTI. Maybe it takes time.

- turkey, like beef, is best with a cool pink center

3025 2018-11-19 18:39:38 NAmerican buriel grounds. Water pollution. THAT IS ENOUGH. I use solar. It is freakin ' practically free and cleaner than any oil. Especially fracked which likely has caused the earthquakes in OK.. $$$ for corporates who do not want the expense of changing to a cleaner fuel.
3026 2018-11-19 18:39:35 1) Gold seems to be the only line item in China about which westerners have complete faith.  Strikes me as odd.  

2) At current prices.  

3) Agree current acct deficit increases the urgency for China to do something.  Interestingly, Dec CNY oil contract OI is 37m bbls.
3027 2018-11-19 18:39:29 A weak ruble when oil price is high , the rub/oil price is not so correlated with oil in the las year.
3028 2018-11-19 18:39:25 Wayne we have to build pipelines to accomplish this. You'll need to get a pipeline across Que. to get Eastern Canada off Saudi and Venezuelan oil.

3032 2018-11-19 18:39:08 @LushLtd hi. Palm oil. Talk to me. Which of your products have it and which haven't?
3033 2018-11-19 18:39:07 People get hung up on wind and solar being free, but other fuels are also effectively free, nuclear in particular.  Oil, coal and gas cost a bit. It isn't valid to think that solar and wind must be a magic fix just because the fuel is free, total lifetime costs must be counted.
3034 2018-11-19 18:39:05 Yes they did fail as well. Not arguing that. As soon as NDP got voted in companies started to leave and haven't stopped. Oil prices were much better then. Anyway not looking to argue. I don't believe their gov has done anything to help Alberta or Canada
3035 2018-11-19 18:39:00 Stop boosting yourself old man. Tex Schramm, Coach Landry, And JIMMY JOHNSON made the @dallascowboys what they are today. Not your oil money.

3042 2018-11-19 18:38:26 Rosemary essential oil in a diffuser or burning in a candle will help open up the airways as well
3043 2018-11-19 18:38:26 This is clear evidence of Queen's support from terrorist regime! Do we need any other evidence to prove Queen's support of terrorist regime - to get hands out such as Free Oil from terrorist regime!! To Queen Elizabeth...STOP SUPPORTING THE TERRORIST REGIME!!
3044 2018-11-19 18:38:22 The tomatoes? Yeah. Cherry tomatoes, olive oil bath, salt and pepper, low oven for four hours.
3045 2018-11-19 18:38:07 spitballing here... what if these murder tapes reveal Saudi Mbs 100% responsible for the murder.   oil spikes, we then have to start pumping big time... then this CL/NG spread reverses.
3046 2018-11-19 18:38:07 I'm curious: Is this the same Marston who developed the emotion theory that is the basis of the DISC personality inventory? Time-wise it could fit and both seem to be proper snake oil salesmen...
3047 2018-11-19 18:38:04 I need a hot oil treatment and a fresh wrap. maybe tmrw since i’m off

3056 2018-11-19 18:37:03 Went somewhere cheaper to get my oil changed and that shit still isn’t done 2.5 hrs later.... I’ll happily pay the extra $40 at jiffy lube as usually do.
3057 2018-11-19 18:36:54 Getting lunch while oil is being changed. Should be live roughly an hour. Come hang out and let’s fall to the dark side together!
3058 2018-11-19 18:36:54 During my time working in the oil sands I found the work sites overrun with meth and crack users. I left because it was unsafe. Do you think that these drug users have had any effect on companies decisions in the oil sands? Awaiting your response.
3059 2018-11-19 18:36:48 What lol the PCs and cons failed to get oil to tide water as well....placing blame on them is simply uninformed..people pulled put because of the low oil prices, which Notley or Trudeau had no say in as it was a global reaction
3060 2018-11-19 18:36:44 The way I mix natural oils ...might as well start my own oil thing going on
3061 2018-11-19 18:36:42 US was more concerned about Iraq's OIL; they are Muslims kids and currently , we are in crisis , due to lack of regional co-operation among Muslim countries. I think, together. we Muslims countries can overcome all these problems with our own resources.
3062 2018-11-19 18:36:40 My Armenian friend tells me to make an onion paste with olive oil and smear it on chest with warm towel on top. Smells but it breaks up the congestion. Cut onion near your bed also keeps you from coughing. I was desperate one time and it seemed to work.

3066 2018-11-19 18:36:25 Vegans and vegetarians would do well to eat more vegetables and less soy products then. Amazon deforestation not just a product of palm oil, soybean farms also increasing year on year
3067 2018-11-19 18:36:22 Honda will conduct a free product update to implement enhancements to certain 2017-2018 CR-Vs & 2016-2018 Civics, to address potential oil dilution, which may be more prevalent when the vehicles are driven short distances in very low outside temperature conditions. (2/7)
3068 2018-11-19 18:36:21 I quite caring about that. My girls use tea tree oil shampoo (i buy at a salon, best way i found to fight against lice) some people cant stand the smell and tell me or my girls they stink. I feel as long as you know they are clean thats what reall matters.

3072 2018-11-19 18:36:13 Part 3: Once we have a quarter of legal data I'll break out the price sold per gram for oil and flower separately.
3073 2018-11-19 18:36:11 Does someone know of national interest can overrule courts? Lawsuits paid for by American so called environmentalists will continue as long as they have money. Hell maybe Amer. Refiners are secretly funding them as well. They love@15 dollar oil.

3076 2018-11-19 18:35:59 RE: CNY replacing USD in global oil trade - that is not my thesis.  My thesis is it's a matter of Chinese nat sec to gain ability to print CNY for oil, as only US can currently do.  They're using gold to gain cred to do so.  If they do, US has BoP problem, ASAP instead of China.
3077 2018-11-19 18:35:59 Los contratos de TGP siguen en camino, hay que esperar a que todo salga bien. Más que el plazo me llama la atención la intensidad de la caída. El mercado parece extremadamente preocupado, y no veo motivos para tanto (en TK tiene un pase por su dependencia oil, pero TGP..)
3078 2018-11-19 18:35:53 I assume cos Latvia doesn't have a shit load of Oil.
3079 2018-11-19 18:35:47 Think about what you're saying.

Did the oil and opium giants really want to get him "as soon as they could" (hint: no!), or, did they leave him barricaded & virtually helpless in a backwater craphole for many years while our forces pillaged the sandbox (hint: yes!)?

3086 2018-11-19 18:35:22 Oil corporations over producing is not the government’s fault. Are they saying they want some sort of national energy program? Not a bad idea!

I know that industry thinks we should  bow to their every whim, but we’ve had enough. There are other energies and industries to support

3088 2018-11-19 18:34:53 PBOC said 5 yrs ago it would stop buying USTs; most in west ignored it.  PBOC said 3 yrs ago it would use gold to internationalize the CNY, & the earmark of an internalized currency was the ability to invoice oil & gas in that currency.  Most in the west ignored it.
3089 2018-11-19 18:34:52 Looks like you need some lavender oil ASAP to me for your lame ass attitude towards others beliefs lol
3090 2018-11-19 18:34:46 Before you head over the river and through the woods to grandma's house for the holidays...go through a basic check list to ensure the safest drive possible. Do you need new tires, wipers, washer fluid or oil change? Also, remember to watch out for those deer!

3093 2018-11-19 18:34:36 The Petrodollar is entity based on oil and those who it. This can cause political tensions passably to the point of war.  Being able to make your own fuel has meany advantages because a energy source + water + CO2 is more abundant than oil.

3101 2018-11-19 18:33:04 Sending someone to do some shopping but I'm feeling like I should refrain from strictly monitoring figures but simply trust and audit. 

Another part of me says I should aggressively track shit since I am not a politician or oil merchant.

3103 2018-11-19 18:32:58 Won’t go anywhere , red wall...had trump responded harshly, and oil becomes the response to the tune of rapidly increased oil per barrel cost, then you’d criticize him for that outcome, hypocrisy

3119 2018-11-19 18:31:58 Bottom Line: The oil price decline may be more of a symptom of disrupted supply and demand, rather than an indication of the global economy's health. @MarketWatch

3125 2018-11-19 18:31:31 This recent decline may have a less concerning explanation.  The United States sanctioned #Iran while allowing eight nations to continue buying oil from the country for now.  All the waivers resulted in one million more #barrels of Iranian #oil being on the market than expected.
3126 2018-11-19 18:31:29 It is but my guess is you'll make it work and do so with ease :)

3138 2018-11-19 18:30:47 Norway and UK shared N. Sea oil bonanza. Thatcher said private oil firms were best w profits 'trickling down'. Norway set up Statoil, now biggest fund offering every Norwegian ever born good pension
3139 2018-11-19 18:30:46 What does this drop mean for markets?
Some investors believe the price declines are another sign that the global #economy is slowing down. Historically, people have used oil prices as one way to decipher economic health because they can correlate with global growth.  @business
3140 2018-11-19 18:30:42 Carrots and sticks. Take a stick to the oil barons ability to pollute reasoned argument (money out of politics). Redirect oil subsidies to kick start carbon removal technologies (ie. Direct Air Capture).

3144 2018-11-19 18:30:26 The price action in tech stocks reminds me of mid-2008 energy stocks, which were the darling of that era. Just like when the peak oil narrative changed, it seems to have changed here too. Much more negative press for the techs.
3145 2018-11-19 18:30:22 It's not just food that uses palm oil, vast majority of cosmetics, toiletries and cleaning products do to. Ask all of them to #DropDirtyPalmOil
3146 2018-11-19 18:30:22 Essentially what Steve is saying is that we have privatized the cost of oil exploration while socializing the cost of the environmental; damage caused by oi exploration over the years.
3147 2018-11-19 18:30:14 1. Oil Prices Declined

3154 2018-11-19 18:29:56 From interest rates to tariffs to corporate profits, investors had a number of topics to consider recently.  In this week's MMO, we want to focus on two other details that have been driving the market: oil and the midterm elections.
3155 2018-11-19 18:29:51 Does include oil and gas drilling in MPAs ?
3156 2018-11-19 18:29:47 Jumped on the bandwagon and introduced the dirty palm oil subject into our letters of complaint English unit. Sat with some of my class at lunch to see them checking everything in their lunchboxes for palm oil  sad to say my favourite chocolate is guilty, no more Kinder for me!
3157 2018-11-19 18:29:40 Just drove by a Jiffy Lube that shares a building with a restaurant called "Lobster Pot." In other words, if you're looking for a one stop shop specializing in oil changes/raw scallops, fret no more...

3168 2018-11-19 18:28:10 No the issues run much deeper like the retaliation of oil control from saudis, as in $200-$300 per barrel, I doubt Americans want to pay $15-$20 dollars per gallon, economics get it ?
3169 2018-11-19 18:28:05 Lemon and honey. Also steam out with menthol and eucalyptus oil in hot steamy showers loosen up the stuff on your chest
3170 2018-11-19 18:28:04 On the part of easy of doing business, registering a company name is now easier, payment of pensioners, construction jebba -mokwa road,implementation of TSA,ending of oil bunkery...etc
3171 2018-11-19 18:27:49 The percentage of the tax money from transport fuel that goes to big oil is very small, the large majority of it gets swallowed up into other things like the national health etc.  Some if it is spent on roads, most if it the government just pockets, it's a distorted tax system.
3172 2018-11-19 18:27:38 Very basic:
Basic cleanser in shower
Pat dry 
Apply toner 
Apply lotion/baby oil

I know I really need to start using a moisturizer with SPF. I'm cheap.

AMAZON in ATHENS?????????????????
GOOD MORNING JEFF.
3176 2018-11-19 18:27:24 Paris Accord is wealth redistribution: move $100 billion from rich nations to poorer ones.Many EU countries import oil from & have mines in the Third World. Are France & Germany really lowering their emissions when they're importing coal from Mongolia & buying oil from Russia?
3177 2018-11-19 18:27:21 Ugh sakiitttt i scrub with olive oil . Sakit at first bearable after kot
3178 2018-11-19 18:27:16 Someone will be frying fish and half of the hot oil will be on you 
3179 2018-11-19 18:26:55 Adam the Futures traders are actually fixing the price for the US refiners. The ans is for the govt to FIX the export price at WTI-transport costs. Oil Marketing board. Period. Stop getting screwed by price fixing. Govt too Stupid to figure this out.

3181 2018-11-19 18:26:33 Oil dey your head 
3182 2018-11-19 18:26:30 You're right, Rob: Hard to find new questions for old guys -- even when an old guy is asking them? It will be fun anyway. Thanks for your consistent input on here. It's always a pleasure to get a balanced view.
3183 2018-11-19 18:26:12 @SohiAmarjeet “Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi says he shares Albertan’s “frustration” at billions of dollars being lost to the Canadian economy due to oil price discounts linked to export pipeline capacity constraints. “
3184 2018-11-19 18:26:06 Putting a tax on Carbon will work. But why go after Canadians and not simply end subsidies for oil companies? Wouldn't this have the same effect? Then with all the billions saved you could create some very good incentive programs to get people into electric cars and home solar
3185 2018-11-19 18:26:04 True! China is the country that benefits the most from wind turbines / solar panels. 
OTOH they are NET importers of oil and natural gas.
3186 2018-11-19 18:25:55 I have shown this to each of the classes I teach and they have all expressed an interest in trying to avoid palm oil but as we've found out it is in quite a lot of supermarket products 
3187 2018-11-19 18:25:49 The real problem is the oil. Our oil is selling at 15 dollars and Trudeau talks human rights. We NEED Saudi oil now more than ever before. Trudeau has to do something. Unfortunately he won't.
3188 2018-11-19 18:25:39 In high school I made fun of y'all greaseballs, like take a shower  Here I am: 3 years later, applying bottles of body oil & hair masks washing  it off  idk why your parents let you walk around like you got dropped in a deep fryer.

3191 2018-11-19 18:25:18 Agreed.  They're all spineless.  Their addiction to oil has dissolved their vertebrae.
3192 2018-11-19 18:25:15 In 1941, US Sec. of State Hull and Mexican Ambassador Francisco Castillo Najera sign an economic agreement providing for compensation for U.S. oil property expropriated in 1938. Several treaties signed to trade Mexican silver; to obtain loans for roads and railroads.
3193 2018-11-19 18:25:13 I’m screaming  this isn’t a Catholic service grabs the REAL anointing oil!!
3194 2018-11-19 18:25:03 It’s pretty simple in Venezuela they have endless supply of oil and Now are in complete disarray it’s directly related to socialism —- an economy run by the government capitalism is not perfect but best system so far
3195 2018-11-19 18:25:02 the number next to the W is the weight of the oil when cold/winter the other number is the weight when hot
3196 2018-11-19 18:24:58 They need driver's who can bring money. Østberg has Onebet but he fell out with MSport when he had his own car. Greensmith has Crown Oil.
3197 2018-11-19 18:24:54 I agree with the burden the campaigns put on the move towards sustainable palm oil and the resulting despair of people and companies that actually make things work on the ground. Good thing is, the urgency is becoming so clear that parties are overcoming differences to cooperate.

3199 2018-11-19 18:24:47 Coming in mere minutes - Premier Rachel Notley will be talking oil differential at a press conference in Edmonton. I believe there's some kind of ... announcement? Either way, I'll be tweeting. #ableg #cdnpoli
3200 2018-11-19 18:24:31 Give #OtileBrown some break, a car with high milage needs a lot of engine oil.
3201 2018-11-19 18:24:27 @mytalk1071 the microwave thing is crazy yes, but who thought people would embrace dropping a turkey into a vat of HOT OIL to fry the bird. I mean...what could possibly go wrong...
3202 2018-11-19 18:24:27 Just finished two: IoT in Agriculture (implementation of new LoRa platform within largest rose greenhouse in Netherlands) and IoT in Oil and Gas for pipe monitoring.
3203 2018-11-19 18:24:25 What needs to disappear is all that oil on ya forehead
3204 2018-11-19 18:24:23 You really think that,  Grieg , Nalcor , Canopy and Husky / off shore oil interest have not been running NL.   Come on ;  This is NL. , you know the jokes , well they are not jokes in their eyes . Bend over , would you like a little Vaseline with that .
3205 2018-11-19 18:24:03 I know the oil companies use private forecasting services and I know the meteorologists there are very skilled individuals!
3206 2018-11-19 18:24:01 I’d stick with just the aloe and vitamin E oil or peppermint.
3207 2018-11-19 18:23:55 The world does not want pipelines, surely you can see the writing on that wall. The world thinks of the oilsands as dirty oil, that will not charge. The world is trying to move away from oil. Its time for Alberta politicians to take there head out of the sand
3208 2018-11-19 18:23:54 Salad oil. I wonder exactly when “cooking oil” replaced that in recipes not involving salad.
3209 2018-11-19 18:23:30 "Oil, also known as Exxon" 
3210 2018-11-19 18:23:17 half of the income has been used to fill the crater done by corrupt Cong. Petrol bonds+into,Iran's oil due,subsidy
3211 2018-11-19 18:23:12 I mean its not like the sun isnt out near often enough and with enough strength in Canada to make it worth while and that the majority of canada's energy is hydro followed by natrual gas and the main purpose of the pipeline/refinery is to sell our oil.
3212 2018-11-19 18:23:12 I really like this, so I'm gonna do it.

1. coffee
2. my favorite pens
3. my books that i've shared with friends that have everyone's writing/comments in it
4. painted nails
5. my new essential oil diffuser (gosh i hate myself for putting this....i'm such a white girl)
3213 2018-11-19 18:23:11 It's not far fetched, & it's going better than expected.  We can tell that b/c the CNY bears are *crickets* on CNY oil contract.  If CNY oil works, CNY will not have a BoP problem for long, long time.  If CNY oil wasn't working, CNY bears would be highlighting that it wasn't wkg.
3214 2018-11-19 18:23:03 That's a tough one. What did it feel like when they reached their first Grey Cup? What do they think of today's game? What went wrong with the Esks this year? What are each of them doing these days? What drove them to want to come to this event?
3215 2018-11-19 18:22:59 Bullshit. Total and complete BS. It's time for us to ramp up the development of alternative energies. When the oil industries fade & fail (like salt industry did 100 yrs ago) The Saudis other middle Eastern oil States will have no $ to prop up their dictators.
3216 2018-11-19 18:22:55 Evil human C. Watts was just sentenced -3 life terms+ for the murders pregnant wife & 2 beautiful daughters who were thrown into oil. Sad but amazing work by all LEO & related professionals who brought this psycho to justice. #forensicscience #BackTheBlue

3220 2018-11-19 18:22:04 Why dont you spin it and research for truth.  Ill give you a tip.  Laden was Bush  jr friend.   You know bush owned plenty of oil. Now if you can learn to search.  Go 4 it. Which you ppl so brainwashed, you beleive what your told only
3221 2018-11-19 18:22:02 Ahh thank you! Tea Tree Oil is actually too harsh for my skin (I have sensitive ass skin) should I mix it with something else?
3222 2018-11-19 18:21:54 That would be great but is it legal?

BTW, it's nice to see oil capitalists, usually firm believers in absolute free markets, ask for govt regulations when their free market forces resulted in the collapse of the price of their commodity!
3223 2018-11-19 18:21:54 Di na ako gagamit ng oil pastel
3224 2018-11-19 18:21:52 Said that to myself last night. The league is getting younger and faster. A kid line would actually help the oil. Growing pains, sure. But have to start somewhere. Status quo isn’t working
3225 2018-11-19 18:21:46 And the oil industry....
3226 2018-11-19 18:21:45 What about the cornish...they dont feel anything but "Cornish"
Its all bullshit.
This talk of Shetland and Orkney staying with England.
It proves what we've been saying all along...its all about the fucking oil!!
3227 2018-11-19 18:21:33 What the hell!!  It's to bad our oil is so much cheaper than the rest of the world. If we were able to use our own resources rather than importing we would be better off as a country.
3228 2018-11-19 18:21:25 faut mettre du bi -oil !

3231 2018-11-19 18:21:00 Nope I already told him be ready for it to need injectors too lol. He’s the type of person to take his truck to a shop for a battery or oil change so it’s like talking to a brick wall lol

3233 2018-11-19 18:20:49 SALTINES

SALTINE CRACKERS HAVE BEEN RUINED SINCE THEY REMOVED ANY SIGN OF SHORTENING, LARD,
FROM THEM!

SURELY THEY COULD ADD SOME KIND OF COOKING OIL,

SO SALTINES STILL MELT SO EASILY & TASTES SO GOOD IN YOUR MOUTH,

NOT JUST DRIED-FLOUR-MIXED-WITH-WATER(HOME-MADE-PAPER-GLUE)!
3234 2018-11-19 18:20:48 The oil will get there wins, but with out some secondary depth and strong puck moving dman and strong net-minding playoffs are not in the pitcher.  Things need to change if they want to keep 97 happy
3235 2018-11-19 18:20:48 I'm going to be real with you Cenk.

We know it's real.

Problem is democrats want to use it as an excuse to destroy their political enemies.  (Oil and gas namely)

Destroying our economy will result in more death and loss than any positive environment impact it could create.
3236 2018-11-19 18:20:42 getting an oil change is so scary ndkdjdk i HATE
3237 2018-11-19 18:20:31 The only tip I give anyone. Always check your Liquid volume (good to do with water) before dropping the turkey in hot oil.  I’d prevent 98% of catastrophes.
3238 2018-11-19 18:20:25 It has mate beard oil helped  only 11 days and back to shaving lol
3239 2018-11-19 18:20:22 I know more than a handful families that lived in the middle east
for oil jobs, when things weren't great here in the '80's.
If they left the compound ... (and that's a big 'if')
  there were many rules.
and they all knew the rules long before going there.
3240 2018-11-19 18:20:12 Were I them, I'd be very angry with the snake oil salesmen who conned them into voting for brexit.

3250 2018-11-19 18:19:13 Brad .. without carbon pricing who continue to be on the wrong side of the oil pipeline issue. Perhaps you should go rake leaves.
3251 2018-11-19 18:19:03 I want fried turkey for thanksgiving. My job posed to give me one, so I need to see who got a deep fryer or crawfish pot to fill w/peanut oil 
3252 2018-11-19 18:18:58 How about the Orangutans and the disappearing habitat due to the Palm Oil industry, instead of talking why not actually do something positive and actually DO something, now there's a novelty.....

3261 2018-11-19 18:18:02 Ysabella speaking when you are inhabited by his Spirit makes the effect of transforming those your speaking to from the inside. The oil is never to be wasted, you must discern his voice so he can penetrate the disgraces, the disgraceful and the very nature of men. & I agree
3262 2018-11-19 18:17:54 They should have dropped him in the barrel filled with oil that Fk
3263 2018-11-19 18:17:47 Thank you Kiva for giving me a free oil change and a free recall on my service for haveing me wait 4 hrs
3264 2018-11-19 18:17:23 Rigs all over the place and none of them where they need to be - over the wells!! Please, get them working and get the effing oil out of the ground. We have a disastrous balance sheet and time running out - show some urgency!!

3267 2018-11-19 18:17:08 Jen Kirkman,

    The only reason Putin didn't want Hillary Clinton to become president was that she would've taken over Syria, and stolen Putin/Assad's oil profits, thus threatening a world war with Russia.  This is a sentiment you should share if you truly cared about people.
3268 2018-11-19 18:17:04 And an oil drill to reach the depths of #Trump’s corruption.
3269 2018-11-19 18:17:03 These are hash oil cartridges, you just put them on a little battery and can get blast off stoned in like 2 seconds. They don’t smell either. Can literally smoke weed anywhere. They make them with DMT now too
3270 2018-11-19 18:17:00 I don’t have but the clients I train have used coconut oil on they skin and from training with me their skin has gotten tone and the cellulite has disappeared
3271 2018-11-19 18:16:58 Whats bad is that you all dont know the why's? You dont know nothing cause to airheaded to search for truth.   Laden was Bush's  friend. He bought oil from family.  He died od pancreatic  cancer
3272 2018-11-19 18:16:55 ran out of cbd oil and I sad

3274 2018-11-19 18:16:51 I feel your pain I had to change the oil in my car last week 
3275 2018-11-19 18:16:47 Boss: we need oil and minerals from this formation. 

Geophysicist, holding cables and geophones, to rock:
 ve haff vays of makink you talk
3276 2018-11-19 18:16:45 when you come in for an oil change and find out you need $500 in repairs 
3277 2018-11-19 18:16:41 Well it's not as though They've got much else to do......Apart from squiting a little oil on the cogs every few mins. onto that we oiled machine.....
3278 2018-11-19 18:16:35 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
3279 2018-11-19 18:16:20 Coconut oil will heal it in no time. You may need to use a lower developer
3280 2018-11-19 18:16:18 How my day started.

Get in combine rolls once then clicks.
Put head on steering wheel and phone rings, find out 9520T is putting antifreeze in the oil.  During that phone call get text telling me a dryer just quit.
Total time elapsed...  2 minutes.
3281 2018-11-19 18:15:54 The thought that keeps going through my mind is if commodities follow next like it did after 2000 and in 2008.  I’m biased long but ferts, uranium names, nat gas names have been resilient (oil/copper/gold/silver not so much but can argue they’re setting up for big moves)
3282 2018-11-19 18:15:47 Remember, you have to cook it in coconut oil so it slides into the trash easier.
3283 2018-11-19 18:15:36 Whole raw organic coconut oil
3284 2018-11-19 18:15:34 Trudeau honestly doesn't care...all part of his "phasing out the oil sands". Well everyday Canadians care and we're tired of his arrogance, sanctimony and anti-oil hypocrisy.
3285 2018-11-19 18:15:30 you mean its not a well oiled machine ... is it maybe snake oil?
3286 2018-11-19 18:15:23 ใครจะว่าเราเวอร์ก็ช่างเถอะ แต่บอกตรงๆ ทุกวันนี้เราฟังเพลง นี่แหละความรัก ของ #เป๊กผลิตโชค ไม่ได้จริงๆ เปิดฟังทีไร น้ำตามาตั้งแต่ดนตรีขึ้น เราคิดถึงคนร้องเพลงนี้
3287 2018-11-19 18:15:18 If a Muslim country implemented such a draconian law there would be calls for the US to invade*

(*only if they had oil,  obviously)
3288 2018-11-19 18:15:07 One thing I dont get is the price of gas&diesel in Alberta is higher than it should be. There is a fair amount of oil refineries in Alberta and the price still gets pretty steep.
3289 2018-11-19 18:15:01 How did i wear an outfit for 40 minutes top and i have oil, salad dressing, steak, shrimp, gauc, nachos, sushi all on my lap... run me my money son
3290 2018-11-19 18:15:00 Bearish bets on Crude Oil, per the CFTC, jumped 14% last week and have tripled since the peak despite OPEC statements. WTI crude is now down 7.5% on the year.
3291 2018-11-19 18:14:55 OIL!!!
3292 2018-11-19 18:14:55 If it was up to them and the feds the fishery would have been done years ago.
 Get us out of the way. Too much oil for us to coexist. These past couple days are proof it's happening.
3293 2018-11-19 18:14:47 Yep, going to fry it up, with Char Broil oil less fryer, no mess and great tasting,
3294 2018-11-19 18:14:34 Hi hello, fossil fuels are ruining our climate and killing ocean species. We need to drastically reduce the amount of hydrocarbons we burn.

Scientists say two thirds of the oil in the ground must stay there if we want to avoid a climate disaster.
3295 2018-11-19 18:14:34 We must  adopt  a  new  economic  management  model  that  will  cure  all  the federating  units  of  this  addiction  to  oil  revenues. - Atiku Abubakar 

#TheAtikuPlan
3296 2018-11-19 18:14:17 But then you got power and bought a 65 yr old leaky oil pipeline for $4.5 billion dollars using Canadian taxpayer money. That stain will stay on you and everyone else in the @liberal_party forever
3297 2018-11-19 18:14:12 Because they believe they control us through oil it gives them the leverage to do whatever they want.
3298 2018-11-19 18:14:09 Watch the type of vegetable oil you are eating!!
3299 2018-11-19 18:14:06 I will die on the hill of coconut oil should not be in things.
3300 2018-11-19 18:14:05 It works to clean and lubricate a engine .... so probably for an oil change to get rid of contaminated oil ... then replace with recommended oil
3301 2018-11-19 18:14:04 also so weird that this sort of response is peddled by, uh, a weird and spammy CBD oil vendor?
3302 2018-11-19 18:14:03 Boneless, skinless fried in grapeseed oil...yummy

3307 2018-11-19 18:12:58 That rather depends on where it's from and how it's farmed.  If it's UK grown without the use of pesticides (especially neonics) it's not going to be as bad as palm oil.  But any mass mono-cultured ingredient is going to have an environmental cost.

3316 2018-11-19 18:12:14 Olive oil, garlic, basil and mushrooms!
3317 2018-11-19 18:11:55 I gotta go get an oil change & go to Ulta today  I already know ima spending a heavy check in Ulta when I’m really not trying to.
3318 2018-11-19 18:11:38 I said R&D so operational etc dont come out of it.  What I’m getting at is the vast majority of R&D for the oil industry is aimed at getting more oil, not at diversification into alternatives
3319 2018-11-19 18:11:38 That olive oil gel really hold my hair good
3320 2018-11-19 18:11:20 John S. Duffield: “In contrast to the United States and Britain, but like France and Japan, Germany has not possessed large reserves of oil and gas, making it dependent on imports of those valuable energy sources.”

3324 2018-11-19 18:11:05 Hi Jane. Since 2015, we have sourced 100% of our palm oil for our own-label food products from sustainable RSPO-certified sources. We are on track to ensure that 100% of palm oil for our own brand non-food products is sourced from RSPO certified sources by the end of 2018.
3325 2018-11-19 18:10:39 Hard to imagine for a guy who has created next to no offence, this team certainly looks worse without Ryan Strome on it.

3336 2018-11-19 18:09:46 Why hasn't Trudeau, for all his talk about human rights not done the same. And why are we buying oil from them when Alberta has all that we need. Yes pipelines . Through Quebec. Not happening.
3337 2018-11-19 18:09:33 Perhaps he thought the equation related to barrels of oil during a referendum period. He’s right you know.
3338 2018-11-19 18:09:32 Just stop use palm oil and please stop calling it a vegetable oil, it comes from a tree. There are enough oils available without destroying an animals natural habitat. #Palmoil

3343 2018-11-19 18:09:10 Just bought smoked haddock En croute from Saintsbury's and it contains palm oil.  I never imagined it would.  Shame on you, Saintsbury's!  You support the killing of orangutans.

3345 2018-11-19 18:08:52 That wasn’t their purpose. We only went there to stop oil from changing its trade currency from US dollar to gold. Petrodollar.

3355 2018-11-19 18:07:47 That's probably a very conservative estimate.  Think about the cost of ER visits, butane hash oil (marijuana labs) explosions which taxes our fire fighters and also displaces neighbors.  The cost of housing people and loss of their homes is huge, let alone burn treatment.
3356 2018-11-19 18:07:41 Some guy is advising men to use their wife's or girlfriend's creams to moisturise their face. Guy! Dont do it, u dey look for serious quarrel. Those creams de de too expensive for the way wey we men go use am.

3367 2018-11-19 18:06:43 Same with Portuguese wines (e.g Porto and Madeira) and cheeses, olive oil. The UK will face sheer unbridled hostility if they believe they are able to compromise that. Everyone will prefer a no deal Brexit

3387 2018-11-19 18:05:02 O/N Wrap:
US equities under the pump as tech, energy (oil), and building confidence all weigh upon sentiment; Tory MP's require 6 more signatures to officially challenge Theresa May's leadership - GBP wobbling; #NZD and #AUD in lockstep, losing ground to the #Greenback.

3395 2018-11-19 18:03:34 Just thinking of the comment box dude who said the poems in my last book read like “a series of lesser Friends episodes” and started cracking up. Sometimes our mean reviews are genuinely funny, right? I mean, I’d still boil him in oil, but he gets some props.

3403 2018-11-19 18:02:28 1. Well true, but previous administrations could have paid it But didn't even when the price of crude oil was at an all time high!
2. You should follow @toluogunlesi and @FMPWH for more

4. What was the production like in 2015?
3404 2018-11-19 18:02:28 Fuck no, we'd have to accept their crappy food.

3406 2018-11-19 18:02:11 Nothing ideological about facts. Where is the landlocking when the "Majority of Western Canada’s crude oil exports to US not exposed to record high discount between WCS and WTI"
3407 2018-11-19 18:01:51 A strong reason to shift to Nuclear Energy. Especially in places like California where almost all our electricity comes from oil and gas, and accounts for 60% of the greenhouse gas we emit in the state.
3408 2018-11-19 18:01:48 UK EXPORTS? Mineral fuels including oil was the fastest-growing export product among the top 10 categories, up 38.4% from 2016 to 2017 led by increased international sales revenue for UK’s crude oil, refined petroleum oils and petroleum gases.
3409 2018-11-19 18:01:47 Think of 2013. In January, @MedvedevRussia says at Gaidar Forum that GDP growth must be around 5%, and at the end of the year it's 1.3%...before oil price collapse and sanctions. My view is that it's lack of structural reform + demography that are at the heart of weak growth

3411 2018-11-19 18:01:25 The price may be dropping but oil companies costs are much reduced.
3412 2018-11-19 18:01:24 Just like Venezuela. They have the largest oil reserves in the world but only run on 20% capacity due to poor management.
3413 2018-11-19 18:01:14 Value based pricing or “just price” popular in the medieval time is long gone and was replaced by the supply and demand pricing model. Even oil or precious metals could and did go way below the production costs at a time.

That’s the …
3426 2018-11-19 18:00:43 It means that the offshore oil issue is not negated by the Longueuil sewage issue. Both are distinct, unique, environmental challenges that need immediate solutions. Using one in an analogy does not diminish the importance of the other. My apologies if I misinterpreted you.

3433 2018-11-19 18:00:20 With less than 3 months before #Nigeria pres elections, main contenders incumbent pres Muhammadu #Buhari & opposition Atiku #Abubakar unveil manifestos. Buhari leans on anti-corruption drive, with Abubakar looking to economic measures such as investments into the oil sector
3434 2018-11-19 18:00:16 You can never have energy independence if you export your finite resources. Other countries have vastly larger oil reserves. National security... the country that runs out oil first loses. 50 years or so left then the US will get over run

3436 2018-11-19 18:00:11 So today for the first time, I used Nutrogena oil after bath. Man these ladies are enjoying different freshness errday

3438 2018-11-19 18:00:02 Our primary goal should always be human rights. “Hypocrite” is never an acceptable role. Our oil needs, or anything else, are not more important than lives. Values and morals should always be foremost. Where is Eleanor Roosevelt when we need her most?
3439 2018-11-19 17:59:59 I prefer to eat boiled yam with red oil that has cameroon pepper in it.
3440 2018-11-19 17:59:55 Been listening to Drilled from @CriticalFreqPod and just learned that oil companies were paying to put climate denying advertorials in the New York Times every week for THIRTY YEARS. Cool! Fine! Fair! Awesome!
3441 2018-11-19 17:59:44 we are not going to *punish* Saudi Arabia and piss them off for a variety of reasons.  among them, The US$ is demanded as payment for crude oil by OPEC.  People have NO idea how significant that is
3442 2018-11-19 17:59:15 NFL is selling snake oil. Ratings must be bad.
3443 2018-11-19 17:59:14 If you all really had dung and knowed the real story, bin laden was Bush's  friend.  Thts where he had bought his oil
3444 2018-11-19 17:59:10 Yes! I actually went platinum yesterday so that happened to me yesterday. I lathered my scalp with coconut oil and Aloe overnight to relieve the damage and dryness. Works wonders 
3445 2018-11-19 17:59:08 Use oil on a papertowel and make your waffle.
3446 2018-11-19 17:59:01 You really know how to make me feel as virgin as oil.
3447 2018-11-19 17:58:57 The way the Warriors are going down , they’ll soon discover crude oil 
3448 2018-11-19 17:58:55 So mtu anichafulie nyumba na mamafuta ati coz we lighting up sex? Someone told me she would bring massage oil...tulimaliziana apo. 
3449 2018-11-19 17:58:54 Every week dozens of huge oil tankers come into the Port of Los Angeles riding high and dry.  A couple of days later they sail off low and slow with millions of barrels of our oil.  Yet we still pay extortionist prices to Saudi Arabia to import their oil!
3450 2018-11-19 17:58:51 It dried my hair out horribly. I started using this Shea butter and hair oil from this soror and I’m in love with it
3451 2018-11-19 17:58:44 I fell soory for u,by the way karibuni tena,i have a plan with big project,
SUNFLOWER OIL...200 acres of land.
3452 2018-11-19 17:58:41 Sadly, it won't "hurt" him. He'll retire, get the check for the rest of his life, and become a lobbyist for big pharma or oil or whatever.
3453 2018-11-19 17:58:30 It’s EASY humans - vote with your $$$ - no #Oreo buying until they switch to CLEAN PALM OIL. they CAN afford it.
3454 2018-11-19 17:58:30 Came for and oil change. Ended having to replace 4 tires
3455 2018-11-19 17:58:29 We finally have a chance to transform the destructive #palmoil industry from within. Tell global palm oil body @RSPOtweets to vote to stop certifying companies like @Indofood that exploit people and land for cheap palm oil in its NEW principles #RSPO #RT16
3456 2018-11-19 17:58:27 Agreed football needs systematic investment with patience the premier league can be a good lesson,after investing Leicester city won the trophy, Manchester city is playing a very sexy football after pouring oil money. Its high time to have long term plans in football.
3457 2018-11-19 17:58:24 Funny how the support ends after our men and women return from active duty.
You didn’t even give them adequate bulletproof vests in Iraq.
That sure is some expensive oil you got us
3458 2018-11-19 17:58:21 I’ve trained my body to be happy with only one meal a day for dinner.  Otherwise it’s coffee or tea with heavy cream or coconut oil for calories during the day
3459 2018-11-19 17:58:20 Oil change then playtime time
3460 2018-11-19 17:58:13 Oil change for my baby 
3461 2018-11-19 17:58:12 Bin Laden and Saudis did All the Damage in 911. America is still buddies with Saudi Arabia,. Oil, go figure!
3462 2018-11-19 17:57:59 Bloody hell. Any now apparently they are blocking roads outside oil raffineries
3463 2018-11-19 17:57:53 Is it today? You should check out oil mill on Wednesday.
When trailer fail break now, they will say is devil
3464 2018-11-19 17:57:52 PDP borrowed $500m to start d Kaduna-Abuja rail system when oil was as high as $140pb, still d project was not executed.

3465 2018-11-19 17:57:39 What if the recent oil plunge makes $100 oil *more* likely, and not less?
3466 2018-11-19 17:57:38 @grazedotcom just checked the ingredients on Graze crunch - palm oil! Will never be bought again
3467 2018-11-19 17:57:27 Israel supports mass migration to western countries, but refuse to accept any themselves even though they’re next door. They’re evacuating the ME to gain control of oil.
3468 2018-11-19 17:57:22 weren't they betting oil prices fall... per the latest when all the big "Swiss cheeses" met and gave their forecasts?
3469 2018-11-19 17:57:19 This shea moisture oil smell so good
3470 2018-11-19 17:57:16 I'm not sure what that response is intended to mean? It is both possible to want to ensure that zero oil is spilled and to try to present information in a context (and a format) that is comprehensible to the public and puts the numbers into perspective.
3471 2018-11-19 17:57:02 It's not all bad. Heating oil is cheap and petrol prices have deceased
3472 2018-11-19 17:57:01 #Oil shot back up following six weeks of losses as speculation of #OPEC weighing bigger output cuts overshadowed signs of expanding American #crude production.
3473 2018-11-19 17:56:56 This is just more of the same US foreign policy, truly a “nothing to see here let’s move on and continue our arms and oil deals”. This video was at least honest. I don’t like them either but I can appreciate that this is more transparent than we’ve ever been - not a high bar
3474 2018-11-19 17:56:48 Truffle oil??
3475 2018-11-19 17:56:42 Yes those are both faves!!! X What I really want is roast veg recipes beyond sprinkle with olive oil and s/p but I’ve had a few great suggestions so far!!
3476 2018-11-19 17:56:39 นี่ก็เริ่มอยากยายค่ายจากอดิดาสไปแบรนด์อื่นละ นอกจากนีโอคือพื้นแข็งมากเว่ออีก 2 คู่ที่เหลือ ประเด็นคือซื้อแบบฝากซื้อไม่ได้ลองก็ไม่ได้เห็นถึงปัญหานี้ ดูจากดีไซน์ที่อยากได้อย่างเดียวเลยจ้าา ถึงว่าทำไมคนปล่อยขายกันเยอะ คอนเวิร์สพันห้าสิบที่เคยซื้อตอนปีหนึ่งยังรู้สึกดีกว่าอ่ะ…
3477 2018-11-19 17:56:33 You using oil or butter?
3478 2018-11-19 17:56:16 My CBD oil is finally kicking in Dave.
3479 2018-11-19 17:56:01 Last week I made possibly my favourite rice of all time and tonight I’m making it again: cook brown rice until it’s pretty soft (which takes forever, but is worth it); make a sort of parsley pesto (whizz up flat leaf parsley/oil/garlic/lemon/salt&pep); coat the rice in it, eat.
3480 2018-11-19 17:55:59 I’m learning everything doesn’t work for everybody. I tried coconut oil in my hair, that did absolutely nothing.
3481 2018-11-19 17:55:47 Oil
3482 2018-11-19 17:55:47 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
3483 2018-11-19 17:55:43 Oils are available online ... onion oil. It worked for my hubby. 
3484 2018-11-19 17:55:38 I need some coconut oil bruh
3485 2018-11-19 17:55:32 Working with oil he want to cede to us in Niger Delta by his restructuring.

Is he going to restructure in 2026?

Only MMM people will take Atiku serious.

3486 2018-11-19 17:55:24 It’s too bad the world needs Saudi oil so much.
3487 2018-11-19 17:55:24 "At least they know he is who he is".  True.  He's one of the most successful snake oil salesman of all time.
3488 2018-11-19 17:55:22 While it would certainly be nice to just drive a vehicle, a responsible owner will recognize the fact that it will eventually need maintenance. Oil changes, belts, battery replacement, brake pad replacements and tire rotation are just some of the tasks needed to ensure that...
3489 2018-11-19 17:55:22 It's not very often I say this but my mother is a legend and supports me so much. She just got me 500mg strength CBD oil for my vape and within 15 minutes I had stopped crying from pain and was feeling bit better #fibroflare #Fibromyalgia #pain #ChronicPain #chronicillness #life
3490 2018-11-19 17:55:19 What happens to other sector, oil should be a forgone ........leaders please we need to diversify.
3491 2018-11-19 17:54:56 Ours are off during the day and on at rush hour but our rush hour isn’t like yours. Lol
3492 2018-11-19 17:54:55 @FoxNews he is right. They keep pushing for scortched earth for higher oil
3493 2018-11-19 17:54:53 I would be questioning “Nathan” Pelosi if he had taken big oil money for years and years and blocked the democrats’ attempt to impeach Bush for lying to the world to invade a country. I’d question him just as much. Stop minimizing us. It’s important to question authority.
3494 2018-11-19 17:54:41 maybe stop sending Saudis oil money and war toys would help
3495 2018-11-19 17:54:37 1. Put salmon on foil.
2. Mix brown sugar and olive oil until you have a medium-thick paste.
3. Apply to salmon.
4. Top with a layer of garlic. So much garlic.
5. Crown w/rosemary sprig.
6. Bake.
3496 2018-11-19 17:54:22 Whatever the cause of this oil spill, I hope that the blame isn't put on forecasters. Thursday's storm was well forecast days in advance in regard to central pressure, track, wind and wave heights. #nlwx
3497 2018-11-19 17:54:02 $70 later I have my oil changed 
3498 2018-11-19 17:53:50 baby oil with the flash on.....  Shot
3499 2018-11-19 17:53:35 The oil change people could literally walk up to me with a wire hanger that they dipped in chocolate  and my reaction would be 

“ ok thanks, no air filter replacement today”

3501 2018-11-19 17:53:29 Segment w/Mark Fisher re oil and natty was of interest to me.  He said you buy when the news is bad & the thing you're trading stops going down.  Very true. Thing is, I don't think the news is that bad right now.  Just rates & some tariff weakness
3502 2018-11-19 17:53:20 They say that Apple Cider Vinegar, Coconut Oil, Turmeric and Cinnamon are all good things that regulate blood sugar (as well as providing other positive health effects) so I try to consume them nearly every day.
3503 2018-11-19 17:53:04 No #Phillies news so he’s not busy rubbing coconut oil on Kapler’s nuts. He may be the worst in Philly sports talk and that’s an accomplishment
3504 2018-11-19 17:52:59 Also why electrifying transport sector makes sense, reduces oil dependence.
3505 2018-11-19 17:52:58 I do not know why I love Dreads so much ... but ohhh let play in your hair daddy  you need some oil in yo scalp 
3506 2018-11-19 17:52:57 @realDonaldTrump polices kill markets. Signs of worse to come are oil down, dollar up and @realDonaldTrump trade war

3508 2018-11-19 17:52:37 I switched to a fish oil with vitamin D during the winter months. Found out I was Vitamin D insufficient through blood work but it's commonly suggested as a SAAD mitigation (not full-blown cure, helps with energy). You can find it as is or coupled with other vitamins / fish oil
3509 2018-11-19 17:52:30 Right. Big Oil will save us.
3510 2018-11-19 17:52:25 Part 1/2
Minister Letto just assured the people of the province that even though more than 250,000 Litres of crude oil was dumped into the ocean Friday, there is no harm to wildlife, fish or birds. ( THIS IS HARD TO BELIEVE )

This statement is shameful and Letto and.. #nlpoli
3511 2018-11-19 17:52:22 They used the civilian version of Sea King in the Gatwick Heathrow shuttle - Chinooks were used for oil operations (with one tragic incident )
3512 2018-11-19 17:52:22 Good morning! 

Chris Watts, the man that brutally murdered his pregnant wife, and 2 grade school aged daughters and shoved their bodies in an oil tank, was sentenced to life in prison today! Escaping the death penalty by the mercy from both families.
3513 2018-11-19 17:52:20 Somebody take my car to get an oil change ?
3514 2018-11-19 17:52:17 I had the most fucked up dream series last night and I think it’s cus my cousin made me rub peppermint oil on my temples b4 sleep
3515 2018-11-19 17:52:13 운동 안 하니까 넘 비참하고 슬픔
3516 2018-11-19 17:52:10 Looking for dairy free and palm oil free margarine...it’s impossible

3518 2018-11-19 17:51:47 Coconut oil does nothing for me once I embraced Shea butter everything changed lol
3519 2018-11-19 17:51:38 Nothing like some fine vintage motor oil to top off your transportation and maintenance date.
3520 2018-11-19 17:51:30 i’m so glad i got to grow up with older brothers. i just traded a haircut and beard trim for an oil change. easiest deal makers ever.
3521 2018-11-19 17:51:28 Atleast I’m intelegent enough to keep it running. Unlike that Honda you had to sell because it needed an oil change
3522 2018-11-19 17:51:26 i sincerely hope so. Along with millions of others, I was disappointed when RMN was pardoned. And bad as his obstruction was, he had redeeming qualities - actually accomplished good things until the wheels came off. This one should be boiled in oil.
3523 2018-11-19 17:51:25 supply and demand but oil also moves with and moves geopolitics...Saudis ...Rusia...Iran...Irack and do no discount a Venezuela ex opec

3527 2018-11-19 17:50:53 Well, she's both.

She's actually got a grifty site where she probably tries to sell snake oil.

It's my pleasure to berate her ilk.
3528 2018-11-19 17:50:52 I have a mini anxiety attack every time I get an oil change, like I don’t know anything about cars, please don’t ask me anything 
3529 2018-11-19 17:50:48 Lots of weather related unknowns this winter for nat gas and heating oil in relation to supplies/storage levels.
3530 2018-11-19 17:50:42 I hate getting my oil changed.
3531 2018-11-19 17:50:38 Or maybe he used anointing oil to fry it
3532 2018-11-19 17:50:37 #PMIKSaysNoMore Before PM Imran Khan, Pakisan's leaders sold out to U.S. bribes, selling their respect, sovereignty, as well as their air space. America is no friend of anyone but Israel, and the weapons and oil corporations.
3533 2018-11-19 17:50:35 100%! And I was taking your side fully.
3534 2018-11-19 17:50:35 You have to wonder where Trudeau is getting all this money to throw away offshore, he's already bankrupt Canada. Maybe some of it is Globalist funds being channelled through him to buy Good Will. After all he has helped them make billions by blockading Western Canadian oil. ????
3535 2018-11-19 17:50:34 Hydrogen peroxide, Amonia, and baking soda. You can add a citrus essential oil to amp up the odor destroying properties and the citrus will deter her from doing it again, at least in that place! Put it in a spray bottle, spray, let dry and then vacuum/wipe clean!

3537 2018-11-19 17:50:28 The popular notion of the World running out of Fossil Fuels assumes Oil being consumed like Soda out of a small bottle on a hot summer evening. The (re)generation of fossil fuels is not a Science that’s well understood. It certainly isn’t “settled”.
3538 2018-11-19 17:50:02 I need to order more castor oil actually
3539 2018-11-19 17:50:00 @RachelNotley is holding a news conference at 11:30 to talk about how the Alberta Government will deal with the oil price differential.
3540 2018-11-19 17:49:53 My hair & edge control..........oil & water.
3541 2018-11-19 17:49:46 Military wise he was not voting Clinton. Trump wise, i dont know his reasons, neither do i care lol. Being an Officer in the military he knows more than we do. Stuff they dont say out loud. 

But more importantly, yes. Change your oil. Filters. Top off your gas. Air up your tires
3542 2018-11-19 17:49:38 Tried that. Even the lavender oil on my pillow and when I was my sheets. Doesn’t work
3543 2018-11-19 17:49:24 I understand that dynamic; this is why CNY oil is such a big deal.  If they can print CNY for oil & other commodities, their current acct deficit "doesn't matter", just like the US, b/c China's non-commodity trade surplus = $700B.
3544 2018-11-19 17:49:18 I didnt make my oil change appointment till 2 so we had enough time to go shopping and get home but now its barely 1...
3545 2018-11-19 17:49:18 Well said, throwing away Britain’s oil wealth was the biggest mistake any post war politician has ever made - we could be like Norway now if it wasn’t for her.
3546 2018-11-19 17:49:13 mark fisher was just on CNBC, I think he is out of $natgas trade but bullish on $ng related stocks and $oil, he's making my day!! why? he read my thoughts lol

3549 2018-11-19 17:48:14 speak for them other ashy mfs I keeps the coconut oil 
3550 2018-11-19 17:48:09 I've had sticky traps placed in the plants for a couple weeks and have caught ten billion of them but it seems not enough to have stopped the cycle of egg laying etc. gotta get me some of the oil i guess. glad it worked for you!!
3551 2018-11-19 17:48:09 Had a similar problem at a Jeep dealership. They didn’t tighten my oil filter down and it leaked al the way back to my house. On top of that they didn’t put the damn oil cap back on. Just left it in the engine bay. Not even an apology. Smh. Sorry bro.
3552 2018-11-19 17:48:03 Combined with distributed solar PV & for-profit individual micro wind farms, coal can stay in ground and oil.  How many homes already have roofs/ lands to reduce purchased electricity to 10-15% of use or net excess?
3553 2018-11-19 17:47:56 You should apply for the job, & present a proposal to build the program by beating all the Bottom 10 usual suspects for a few years & then stepping up from there.

I’ll be your recruiter! (7 years of sales experience in oil & gas, and I played college basketball)

3562 2018-11-19 17:46:36 We implemented a responsible and transparent fiscal plan for the challenging economic times that saw us doing more even with lesser oil revenues.

3569 2018-11-19 17:46:01 And, #Trump not the only one who hoped so, but that failure would be on #GeorgeWBush + the then actual ruler of US #dickcheney + war machine #blackwater #halliburton #SaudiArabia. They murdered Saddam and sons, stole oil fields, but couldn't find #BinLaden - wonder why.

3571 2018-11-19 17:45:54 I honestly like shea butter better than coconut oil.
3572 2018-11-19 17:45:51 I used red oil as just an example, doesn't necessarily mean lyrically. It's just my own way of saying that everything God created is good & with faith can be used for any spiritual purpose. No need demonizing our own stuff. That's inferiority complex & mental slavery
3573 2018-11-19 17:45:42 and 90K followers believe snake oil is a elixir of youth
3574 2018-11-19 17:45:37 Hutchings asks about containing oil. Coady says multiple flyovers. Says a batch spill. Today’s flyover shows no sheen on the water. Checking on wildlife. ROV underwater to check flow lines.
3575 2018-11-19 17:45:32 Look "Erdy Man", stop making deals with those idiots.  They first force you into selling stolen oil, Assad and I sell Oil normally, with the best country development plan,  quick and without extremists terrorists. Ask me about Chechnya

3580 2018-11-19 17:45:07 Employees at pennzoil are arguing with each other while I'm getting an oil change.... 
3581 2018-11-19 17:45:01 In pursuit of mitigating the countries risk exposure the Liberals will do nothing. If you continually whine and don't explain the relevance of why the oil industry is to be supported the conservatives fail. Maybe you should ask what resonates with all Canadians, is it actionable?
3582 2018-11-19 17:44:49 might start messing around with oil pastels

But we don't know exactly how much the patient OR plan paid for the oil specifically bc it was bundled w/ other services

Moral of the story, put in your best wherever you are.

3608 2018-11-19 17:43:03 Okay Doug. Question? Have you been Gabe Kapler coconut oil?
3609 2018-11-19 17:43:02 Also, US big oil wants to control the oil in Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. The oil companies who own the US government don't give a fuck about the well-being of the people in those countries.
3610 2018-11-19 17:42:44 We have meters here. They piss me off. So dumb. Or when there’s NO cars but the one car in front of you decides to stop. Wtf! Plenty of greens went by before you got there. Punch it!
3611 2018-11-19 17:42:44 Oh and you are suddenly the anointed one here who doesn't know that Christianity and Islam do not match. They are like water and oil.
3612 2018-11-19 17:42:32 Who came up with “250 cubic metres” spilled? Husky? Oh that doesn’t sound too bad. Wait that’s 250,000 litres of oil.
3613 2018-11-19 17:42:28 I am a boomer Dem and I resent you saying we love wall street, oil   & war! That has NEVER been our agenda! Guess some of the richer ones might be but not the majority. I personally hate wall street, war, & giant oil companies.

3615 2018-11-19 17:42:05 Oil prices fell, surrendering earlier gains as investors weighed up the effectiveness of a potential cut in supply from OPEC and possibly other exporters in the face of rapidly rising global output.

3619 2018-11-19 17:41:34 _too dry. Add sufficient oil. Add red chilly powder and slightly mash the avla pieces, we want a mish-mash. After about 7-10 minutes, add methi powder, mix well and the achaar is ready. This is a quickie recipe for your level, Tomorrow will give you in the proper format.
3620 2018-11-19 17:41:28 @realDonaldTrump Pollute the rivers with coal dust and the oceans with oil but make sure you rake those leaves. What a moron!! 
3621 2018-11-19 17:41:28 America has let the Saudis two-face us for many years. Mainly because of oil but now that we don't need their oil as much it's arms sales and Iran. Trump is being played again.
3622 2018-11-19 17:41:11 Oil change, dry cleaning, setting up our Living Trust and paying property tax today, man I am Adulting AF. Mom & Dad, thank you so much for prepping me to handle all this. If anyone needs Adulting How Tos I'm here for you. I also wrap presents at a pro level, but charge for that.
3623 2018-11-19 17:41:05 Shit don’t me started on that nonsense! CA implemented metering lights at freeway on ramps. Everyone FLOORS it when their lane turns green pretending to be Big Daddy Don Garlits. Yeah that’s being REAL eco friendly...friggin idiots. Sacramento needs to be flushed!
3624 2018-11-19 17:41:03 The mixture of judgement and pity on the faces of men who give me oil changes really got me fucked up. (I mean not enough to get me to change my oil more often but still)

3631 2018-11-19 17:40:30 So I got some terrible news....

Turns out.. I'm extremely allergic to peanuts.. which means I can never eat chick fil A, five guys, and Chinese. Cause all there food is fried in peanut oil 
3632 2018-11-19 17:40:28 The oil market flipped several years ago from a perceived scarcity of resource to one of abundance....it appears you’re stuck in the prior era
3633 2018-11-19 17:40:27 Fracking loses money unless oil prices are very high. It has been financed so far with massive debt. Keeping Iranian and Russian oil off the market would be a logical way to try to save the US fracking industry from bankruptcy.

3641 2018-11-19 17:40:02 A professional painter can assess your home and decide the best type of paint to use. More and more, acrylic latex paint is chosen because it is durable, resists mildew, and can be used whether the primer is oil- or water-based.
3642 2018-11-19 17:39:53 You have to wonder where Trudeau is getting all this money to throw away offshore, he's already bankrupt Canada. Maybe some of it is Globalist funds being channel through him to buy Good Will. After all he has helped them make billions by blockading Western Canadian oil. ?????

So I was born upper middle class.

3708 2018-11-19 17:33:43 US was looking for an excuse to attack Afghanistan, because it is situated at the corridor of oil & gas rich "land locked Central Asian" states.
They never learned any lesson from Russians, who also tried to capture Afghanistan for the same reason.
US should learn lesson & leave.
3709 2018-11-19 17:33:42 And I'd just started shopping at @IcelandFoods due to their stance on Palm Oil. 
But due to their support of Brexit I'm going elsewhere, and will just have to read the ingredients carefully.
3710 2018-11-19 17:33:24 Watts would have put his daughters through an 8-inch diameter hole on the oil tank... A tuft of hair was found on one of the openings.  All per DA Rourke.  Watts was also out at that site later that day!
3711 2018-11-19 17:33:21 DA Rourke says Watts was slow in methodical in getting rid of the bodies. Watts had texted a coworker the night before to say he wanted to take care of that oil battery where their bodies were found, potentially showing pre-planning. The girls were put in separate tanks.
3712 2018-11-19 17:33:20 There is way too much intertwining going on between W’s scandalous kingmakers and warmongers, votes being stolen in Florida (again) and Texas (I believe votes were flipped to Cruz)- and Trumps minions to be coincidence. Oil... it’s all about the oil, deregulation and oligarchs.

3727 2018-11-19 17:31:24 Aye, there's an Anglosplainer telling me the price is dropping and the amount of oil will be less than reported. The arrogance of these colonialists is breathtaking.
3728 2018-11-19 17:31:11 the oil sands are FAR TOO EXPENSIVE compared to shale oil extraction. there is NOTHING the PCs or the PM can do about it. even with pipelines in place, it still to costly. @AndrewScheer stop lying to the people, saying anything otherwise.

3734 2018-11-19 17:30:05 Too bad we consume 20 million barrels a day. We'll never be able to drill our way to oil self-sufficiency. Never. Which is why any blip in the global oil market — OPEC production cut (the check's in the mail), disaster, political unrest — sends prices up. We are not in control.
3735 2018-11-19 17:29:58 You yourself & people like you are the reason the world is in such a fukin mess!

All these wars came from wanting power. The rich 1% want OIL, GOLD,DIAMONDS,MONEY and POWERFUL POSITIONS.
You want profits at any cost. You use people, media & your position to take it & @ any cost.

It's DC that wants Euphrates to be an internal border, not Damascus. Also hard to blockade oil & grain producers, so to some extent just making a virtue of necessity.
3750 2018-11-19 17:28:11 I would love to rub oil on them after

3767 2018-11-19 17:26:22 In which we pretend that Bin Salman does not control #OPEC. We've been hearing the "OPEC death knell" narrative for years. Next month it's likely to cut production by 1.4Mbod. Only about 1 percent of global oil supply. Do we really expect prices to rise by only that 1 percent?
3768 2018-11-19 17:26:20 We have a lot of oil field workers so they permanently have a layer of black on them that will come off when scrubbed with an alcohol swab.

Minister Letto just assured the people of the province that even though more than 250,000 Litres of crude oil was dumped into the ocean Friday, there is no harm to wildlife, fish or birds. ( THIS IS HARD TO BELIEVE )

This statement is shameful and Letto and....

3789 2018-11-19 17:24:22 If one reads the story of how the US made oil "big enough" to back the USD system in the 1970s, one can imagine how gold will be made "big enough" to settle real trade when it is needed...nearly overnight, & by political fiat/machination.

Several years later, they did not only remove fuel subsidy they swore was a lie, they also did not expose the cabal despite their claim of fighting corruption.
3806 2018-11-19 17:21:48 Oil and gas workers bear the brunt YET AGAIN so that govt can privilege other interest groups that have yet to make ANY sacrifice since the downturn. It’s also incredibly bad economics and not at all the same scenario under which this has been previously attempted.

3837 2018-11-19 17:18:23 I’ll never understand why Quickchek even bothers to put an option for the amount of dressing they put because regardless of your choice they always just put way to much, trying to eat a Italian sandwich here not straight red wine vinegar and oil
3838 2018-11-19 17:18:22 They should be honest and say they represent the interests of oil firms or tobacco or whoever funds them rather than trying to hide behind the ‘think tank’ label
3839 2018-11-19 17:18:20 The modern soldiers have ptsd because they have murdered children for a paycheck, so our queen and government can get there hands on more oil.

3842 2018-11-19 17:18:00 Have to disagree on one count Trevor, Andrew said reason #EnergyEast did not go ahead was because of lack of demand, we now know it was a political decision to save Grit votes in PQ ,and, Alberta oil is being shipped in trucks,so there is that too.
3843 2018-11-19 17:17:57 "Doterra? More like DONTerra!"

My wife scowled as I laughed to myself. She then applied some snake oil to her temples to calm herself down.
3844 2018-11-19 17:17:56 With US producing more oil than ever & with oil generally in decline, there's even less justification for providing Saudi's cover. Hold them accountable.
3845 2018-11-19 17:17:56 Perhaps they should stop providing the power lines , the oil , the bridges , the roads , the planes , the houses you use every day eh ? Let you and your sisters provide that
3846 2018-11-19 17:17:54 That kazoo in the oil tank is rave worthy. Get the glow sticks out.
3847 2018-11-19 17:17:51 A backlash against @IcelandFoods and @Greenpeace by ministers and industry tied up in palm oil saying Rang-tan ad is biased and hypocritical. Look, eliminating palm is v. difficult. Greenpeace not even asking for boycott but to buy sustainable palm instead /1 #thread #PalmOil

3849 2018-11-19 17:17:34 People retweeting old news that supports their position, its amusing.  newest info so far this morning are Saudi oil stocks and the Genscape note on Iranian oil production - rest of it is noise #OOTT

3852 2018-11-19 17:17:17 That it is, not many ways to explain what is happening, it's crazy to see. Alum melted, next to a plastic/rubber cone, that's not. Also saw reports that the land may have gold under it, and a possible site for a future pipeline of oil, China was mentioned in that, IIRC.
3853 2018-11-19 17:17:09 Problem: Do we still need Saudi Arabia’s oil? If yes; makes it difficult. We could lift the federal ban on drilling for oil on the U.S. continental shelf & drill there. Enough oil on the continental shelf to last about 100 years, and we wouldn’t need to import any foreign oil.
3854 2018-11-19 17:17:07 I remember we shot our 1st one outside in the cold covered in baby oil 
3855 2018-11-19 17:17:02 It need not be carbon free - but must be renewable.
A new technology is feasible to turn CO2 into fuels.  Big oil will STIL fight that because anyone can make fuel and their oil assets will be worthless.
Tread cautiously.

3880 2018-11-19 17:14:01 I’m sure you would much prefer a career politician with backing of the NRA, big oil, and Saudi connections. Instead of a fresh, young women willing to learn and share the process of politics to the new generations.
3881 2018-11-19 17:13:55 Probabably. It's all about money with these asshats. The Saudis have a lot invested in the US and are our primary source of oil. Nothing will stop that machine for now.

3890 2018-11-19 17:13:03 Interesting read. It seems the old corporate sins also affect tech companies (sex, political lobbysm). If you compare oil COs and tech COs damage in society is however top of the list to me.

3895 2018-11-19 17:12:37 A lunch idea... Slow-cook cod fillet with minced pan-fried leeks and a dash of diced lemongrass. Add olive oil. Serve on top of spaghetti.
3896 2018-11-19 17:12:28 Let's hope they cut oil production to shore up prices so they no longer need to take on much debt.

3962 2018-11-19 17:05:02 I'd recommend the peekaboo oil slick. They basically color the strands underneath, so the color is exposed as your hair moves. I think some blue strands would look nice. I'm gonna find a picture for you.
3963 2018-11-19 17:04:59 I think @Wouldbescouse put a little too much confidence in what Farage and his Snake Oil salesmen have peddled. Love seeing brexiteers so confidently repeat the facts according to Farage , then reality hits in that they have been lied to.
3964 2018-11-19 17:04:43 Seems ironic that you tweet from inside a home and office heated by oil. And you use a computer and phone charged by electricity produced by...oil. 

If you hate it so much - please be the first to give it up.

I'll wait ...
3965 2018-11-19 17:04:39 Makes sense though right? There are more snake oil users that sellers. When veracity becomes an issue the customer looses trust in the entire category. We have a couple of strategies to fight this, e.g. brands are a decentralized way, standards bodies are a more centralized one.

3971 2018-11-19 17:03:44 Bannockburn: #ECB meets on Dec13. It will confirm its intentions to cease net  new asset purchases at the end of the year. There is some risk that the  incoming data, including the dramatic drop in oil prices, prompt the staff to shave growth and inflation  projections for 2019.

3976 2018-11-19 17:03:33 The rest of the world is burning like this! Massive unprecedented fires in countries such as Greece and Scandinavia. Mainstream media is paid by the trillion-dollar oil and gas industry so very little coverage. Also the flooding is a direct result of man-made global warming.

3982 2018-11-19 17:02:43 According to recent research, there is a link between the intake of certain foods and the over-production of the hormones that cause the creation of oil in your glands. These foods include; carbohydrates, dairy, saturated fats, and trans fat.
3983 2018-11-19 17:02:37 Aw naw, another Anglosplainer. Doesn't take long for the arrogant bawbags to tell us we're wrong. So many of you think you're experts on anything to do with Scotland. BTW  oil today is at 67+, fud.

3991 2018-11-19 17:01:08 During the oil crisis of the 1970s, President Jimmy Carter lowered the national speed limit to 55mph.  This was to reduce gasoline consumption.  Not one Democrat has ever called for lowering speed limits...but climate change is real????

4010 2018-11-19 16:59:34 New 2:1 (CBD:THC) capsules added to BCS online store. Last week they added a THC capsule option too. Looks like Bruce was right with pushing more oil now - will use more of their crop and will have higher margins.
4011 2018-11-19 16:59:21 Please make sure you clean the inside out real good (rinse with water and scrap out with spoon). Rub down with a little olive oil and season it good.

4031 2018-11-19 16:57:11 Thank you and well done! It makes me ecstatic you are leading the pack and will no longer use palm oil plus letting the rest of the world know what’s happening to orangutans. It makes me heartbroken that you have to.

4038 2018-11-19 16:56:48 Australia, American and Saudi Arabia have completely different health systems than Ireland and are considerably wealthier than us.  Saudi Arabia particularly is a very wealthy system as most of its hospitals are donated by companies that want to acquire oil rights

4040 2018-11-19 16:56:41 WTF HOW MUCH IS A OIL CHANGE 
4041 2018-11-19 16:56:31 Mr. Snake Oil Salesman, budgets balance themselves. When you and @stephenharper tried to engineer a balanced budget, you left behind a recession and the lowest economic growth in Canadian history.
4042 2018-11-19 16:56:28 App developers out there: We need an app that allows you to scan products to check for unsustainable palm oil, then offer similar product/brand suggestions that are palm oil free or use sustainably sourced palm oil. Anyone??? It would be a game changer. #appdevelopment #palmoil
4043 2018-11-19 16:56:15 Saw a baby at the oil change place. She smiled at me. Mondays are okay, y’all.

4045 2018-11-19 16:56:14 Yay no parm oil, but reducing your vegan range to add more products made from animals this Christmas, feels like a backwards move. As a lot of the #rainforest is clearer to raise cows......

4047 2018-11-19 16:55:58 no oil in  Pakistan and they need to show better account of where's this money was actually spent before demanding more.

4052 2018-11-19 16:54:52 Its hyperbolic nonsense.

Look, we had a financial crisis, life went on. Oil crisis, life went on. etc. Always we respond to these things and fix them or work through them.

Difference is that if we stay in the EU, life will stay the same shit as now, Brexit give us opportunity.
4053 2018-11-19 16:54:39 This new face oil is life!
4054 2018-11-19 16:54:36 Actually, these vibrant Oil & Gas companies have stolen you blind.

1) Move products in pipelines they own & >overcharge 4 transporting.
2) Under report volumes taken & hide the evidence.
3) Pay royalties on bogus sales to themselves for pennies on the $.
4) Much more.
RICO Fraud
4055 2018-11-19 16:54:22 Man then blackseed oil pills really do help the digestive system and help you lose weight faster too. I love it.
4056 2018-11-19 16:53:40 I did indeed! Was very quick and easy :) shame we didn’t read the instructions and use oil on it though! We’ve used your fake chicken strips as well and they’re very good!
4057 2018-11-19 16:53:40 Commonly in comparisons people only compare the exhaust emissions of a car vs the entire process of electric cars from charging etc. Missing out all of the pollution created in processing oil, transporting it and then finally using it. Overall it is much less CO2

4059 2018-11-19 16:53:33 A collision with those countries would be at war with its neighbors and drag the US in. They  would take over every country in the middle east and use oil as blackmail.
4060 2018-11-19 16:53:17 I think that DPHP right name is *phthalate. Don't know why they continue to use phthalate when you can replace with castor oil or ATBC
4061 2018-11-19 16:53:13 I heard that you can still eat chick fil a because it’s oil is at such a high temperature that it is fine to eat with a peanut allergy (although don’t take my word on it you should probably look it up)

4066 2018-11-19 16:52:35 Do you think this is made worse by all of our oil drilling? We have so many wells under the ocean now and when they are pumped dry, the empty space will not stay empty forever. Is it thought this is what Mars is like?

4096 2018-11-19 16:48:58 I finally got my CBD oil. So far it’s been helpful. I’ll give a better opinion once I’ve used it for a reasonable amount of time.
4097 2018-11-19 16:48:56 Why cant dispensaries be open at like 8am.  I'm naturally an early riser and my oil pen is busted and I gotta fricken wait until 10 now lol
4098 2018-11-19 16:48:38 As hot as it will go. Oil the steak, not the pan and don’t put the salt on ages before you cook it. I find I only need 90 seconds a side for medium rare on sirloin/fillet (1” or less) slightly more on ribeye. Press the steak- should feel like the pad of your thumb for medium rare
4099 2018-11-19 16:48:34 I didn't think it was possible to have CBD oil certified organic at this time. Am I correct in thinking this?
4100 2018-11-19 16:48:29 No it isn’t. Oil is a market.
4101 2018-11-19 16:48:25 California oil is the worst....just so you know....
4102 2018-11-19 16:48:18 I luv baby oil
4103 2018-11-19 16:48:15 I think the first time ever I went to get my oil change by myself I almost bought a brand new car at Superlube
4104 2018-11-19 16:48:11 The reasoning on that is half politics, half conspiracy theory... I think a large part of that problem goes back to the oil crisis/Greenpeace. The work on green cars went into electric/battery.
4105 2018-11-19 16:48:11 Here is the fact. Alberta is sitting on the LARGEST recoverable oil reservers in the world, but we have chosen to not develop them even though everybody else develops their's. If we had no customers, then so be it, but we do. This is self-mutilation, based on ideology.
4106 2018-11-19 16:48:05 They’re a family of billionaires in oil, anyone who fits that description has done ungodly shit

4111 2018-11-19 16:47:50 The saudis also paid to get Iranian oil shut off to increase their share and price.  That move helped both of Trumps friends Putin and the Saudis.
4112 2018-11-19 16:47:50 Can't help but notice @Annjj hasn't responded yet. Can only assume she's busy getting the emergency chairs out and getting the oil nice and hot for the Yorkshire.
4113 2018-11-19 16:47:49 Type of market that is teaching new traders how stops, be it in crypto, tech, oil,  save your account.  Last year's theory now practice.
4114 2018-11-19 16:47:48 The same team when in opposition blamed the then PM of India (MM) for price hike. I'm sure it's because of crude OIL prices even then but they all made a huge cry then and so now it their turn. Karma!! 
4115 2018-11-19 16:47:42 hi, sorry mencelah . i ada pakai simple oil balancing but still oily juga muka . i paai rosken baru okay
4116 2018-11-19 16:47:39 I don't think so sir. Greece doesn't have the planet's 5th largest oil field on its shores. Nor gas, whisky, tech industries or tourism on the same scale as Scotland. But good to share differences of opinion with you. Hope you'll one day vote for an independent Scotland.
4117 2018-11-19 16:47:35 Right up my alley! I like garlic, onions, olive oil, salt, pepper and fresh rosemary.

4120 2018-11-19 16:47:18 The dealership we bought our Porsche from stripped our oil drain plug and no one could fix it. They have been incredibly rude and awful to work with, plus it took them way too long to get the issue resolved. Idk how places like this stay in business

4123 2018-11-19 16:47:07 @BBCWatchdog  Back in 2011 the oil price was $128 a barrel and petrol was £1.37 a litre. Now it’s under $70 a barrel and the price of petrol about the same. Rip off!
4124 2018-11-19 16:47:05 PSA to anyone else who gets itchy scalps in the winter - LAVENDER OIL. Plus, it smells nice 
4125 2018-11-19 16:47:02 it's exactly the kind of B.S. rhetoric that opened the door for a snake oil salesman like trumpolini to convince enough americans that he "says it like it is." By merely sounding authentic, he poked right through the veneer.
4126 2018-11-19 16:46:41 In the management of our oil and gas industry in Nigeria, only two people call the shots. The minister and the GMD. Here, Buhari and Baru.

Hold both responsible for the poor performance experienced.

4131 2018-11-19 16:46:03 The real morons are the Resistance folks who think everyone hates Trump. Finland has their own set of environmental issues. They are burning up their forests to make biofuel because they are being mandated to stop using oil. Guess what happens when you do that?
4132 2018-11-19 16:46:03 Trump is only one person & he puts his pants on one leg at a time like all of U.S.  Because he knowingly lies & says "no climate change" doesn't mean there isn't any.  We are the victims of CLIMATE CHANGE. He wants to dig coal, drill oil and frack, & doesn't care who it affects.

4136 2018-11-19 16:45:50 Might give a cheeky essential oil a go in mine next time then!

4140 2018-11-19 16:45:41 They want the pipeline built they just don’t think it will happen any time soon as this project has been delayed to many times. So this is their short term solution until this thing is built and albertans can get a fair price for their oil. #AbLeg
4141 2018-11-19 16:45:37 Screw them. They have been ripping us off with oil for years.
4142 2018-11-19 16:45:37 I'd like to know how much energy the CBC uses ?  Do the use all electric cars ?  All the power they use is from wind and solar ?  I'd bet 100% no.  Hypocrites .  Oil spoils don't kill the ocean, look at the BP oil spill.
4143 2018-11-19 16:45:34 Judicial Watch is a partisan group. That will spare no expense to root out any corruption in government as long as it's Democrat. Oh it will sue Republicans if it has something to do with climate change because JW main funding comes from oil, chemical and military industry.

4150 2018-11-19 16:44:34 We don’t currently have an exact breakdown of the ‘cheese’ filling, however it is likely to be a fondant like mix, made up of sugar, colouring, milk powder, soya lecithin and vegetable oil. Please refer to the back of pack, for the full ingredients list.
4151 2018-11-19 16:44:34 If your oil seems low, a cheaper solution is to buy an extended dipstick. Also, don’t forget to fill your indicator fluid and put 4 litres  antifreeze in your petrol tank.

4172 2018-11-19 16:42:24 Ok. We disagree...My view is that the softer/less hysterical elements will melt away as 1)weather turns cold 2) petrol prices continue to fall with oil price. That WILL leave harder nuts to carry on. The movement may then turn nastier. It will then lose general public support.

4241 2018-11-19 16:35:56 Are zabardast oil reserves hai.. It's either Canada or Venezuela for #3 spot
4242 2018-11-19 16:35:45 Actually the late eighteen hundreds were using Oil lamps with reflectors that could throw off as much candle power as a 60 watt bulb. True it wasn’t as convenient as a electric switch but not a huge burden either. I know from personal experience as I remember when my grand 1/2
4243 2018-11-19 16:35:41 Pay... To get oil dashed in my hair? Mussi maaaaddddd
4244 2018-11-19 16:35:38 United States Oil Fund sees biggest weekly inflow last week since June 2017. It’s typical for investors to use USO as a tool to bet on short-term price reversals #OOTT #oilmarket #oiltrading #ETFs #WTI
4245 2018-11-19 16:35:36 Those two are engine oil  
4246 2018-11-19 16:35:34 You anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over. Goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life -Ps. 23:5–6 #Prayer
4247 2018-11-19 16:35:33 Our attorney general is a snake oil salesman, just like out president.  The top criminal, bilking people out of millions is now the top cop.  Law and Order President MY ASS!
4248 2018-11-19 16:35:30 Gavin, please make climate change your #1 priority.  Allowing fracking and oil production to continue in the state will ensure a 4˚C warming--our current trajectory. California needs to lead by transitioning urgently to 100% renewable energy. Refuse fossil fuel funding.
4249 2018-11-19 16:35:27 I am trying to imagine trusting my husband with a diamond ring. I am sure he’d gently put it on the ring holder before changing the oil.
4250 2018-11-19 16:35:20 I knew it was real once she rubbed coconut oil in between my individual toes 
4251 2018-11-19 16:35:17 Alaskans own 171,895 shares of ENERPLUS CORP, worth $1,380,419. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in CANADA.

4253 2018-11-19 16:35:00 Twitters analytics have I'm a feminist and keep giving me ads about empowering women. By they're always from Goldman-Sachs or oil corporations.
4254 2018-11-19 16:34:56 Just splurged nearly £200 on oil paint...now just got to make some good art with it to make it pay!! 
4255 2018-11-19 16:34:38 Oil above water.

4259 2018-11-19 16:34:19 Oil secreted from glands on Gabriel’s wings that helps clean them
4260 2018-11-19 16:34:09 If we let 9/11 slide because of Saudi oil money why would we care about a single journalist?  Rhetorical question.
4261 2018-11-19 16:34:08 I'm cooking popcorn and I have put mais seeds in a frying pan w a lot of oil. The thing is that the oil was olive oil and I think it was also good quality olive oil. Sorry mum I've used your oil I guess hahahahhahaha
4262 2018-11-19 16:33:50 I'm querying milligrams cbd in the solution, not ml of solution -- if you have an idea of the specified potency of the oil, we should be able to extrapolate mg from drops pretty easily, allowing fro some variance in count etc...
4263 2018-11-19 16:33:48 Being an adult and gettin my oil changed
4264 2018-11-19 16:33:48 The original plan was to work in an Oil company 
After seeing Organic Chemistry Exam questions in year one, i Opened Instagram Account and started Lebold  studios
4265 2018-11-19 16:33:46 Of course the Fed would prefer to look at crude oil inflation excluding energy.
4266 2018-11-19 16:33:35 How are you
4267 2018-11-19 16:33:32 So you know and still loot the little money left in oil sector...
4268 2018-11-19 16:33:30 Hi there! Thanks for reaching out and for all you do in the community! We look forward to examining more ways to expand the specialty plates program so Albertans have more choice in specialty plates that show their support for charitable causes.
4269 2018-11-19 16:33:20 Agree somewhat Jonathan. However I think that if you remove #4 it may help lessen the feeling of #5. Also I understand the importance of the jobs it creates and how the govt may help with tax dollars (only when needed) but this same courtesy does not seem to extend to Alberta oil
4270 2018-11-19 16:33:19 @ImranKhanPTI @Asad_Umar @SMQureshiPTI @RazakDawood Since FTA is signed Malaysia Pakistan bilateral trade is consistently in favor of Malaysia. How Oranges can be equally weighed to Palm oil? More cereals and value added exports can narrow down trade deficit between 2 countries

4273 2018-11-19 16:32:56 Let’s not act like big oil doesn’t know exactly who will and won’t benefit from often proposed climate change policy.
4274 2018-11-19 16:32:53 Red lights are the invention of oil companies to consume more fuel. Don't stop on red lights. 
4275 2018-11-19 16:32:45 Thank you for that. West of Scotland has an estimated 67,000,000 tons of oil.
4276 2018-11-19 16:32:36 Of course the Fed would prefer to look at crude oil inflation excluding energy.
4277 2018-11-19 16:32:33 coba pakai haple yg grapeseed oil kalau ngga pakai oxy 10
4278 2018-11-19 16:32:31 Not sure of oil in Forth but there are coal seams. These are what Ineos would like to extract by gasification
4279 2018-11-19 16:32:30 @BillClinton didn't miss his shot. Just like you he worried about upsetting our Saudi "allies". He held his fire, as have you, putting oil over lives. He was wrong and soare you.
4280 2018-11-19 16:32:23 It’s Shetlands oil 
4281 2018-11-19 16:32:06 Funny to see #Trump taking sanctions against countries for so-called "inaction" over Bin Laden, which happened years ago under another Presidents watch, yet he is guilty of "Inaction" of sanctions to Saudi Arabia. You stay classy Orangeman and be sure to protect your oil dollars!
4282 2018-11-19 16:31:52 I prefer the powder and capsule, oil is in the capsule. Powder is $105.00 and 30 capsules $120.00. It's much cheaper in states where recreational use is legal.
4283 2018-11-19 16:31:48 Klau ga bio oil beli di guardian
4284 2018-11-19 16:31:36 U.S. oil prices find support as EU reportedly backs French decision to sanction Iran nationals
4285 2018-11-19 16:31:23 il n'y a pas à tortiller, il faut isoler, il faut isoler, il faut isoler!!! quelle erreur du gvt de ne pas en dire un mot en ce moment...
4286 2018-11-19 16:31:14 Hahahaha. Wakili not as straight forward as that. We can become bankrupt at even 75% debt/GDP level. Also, a 100% debt to GDP level is not necessarily fatal. Many countries are over 100 and are just fine. Cash flow is king. Tukipata dollars via oil revenues, hata 100 ni sawa
4287 2018-11-19 16:31:10 Although I just bought a brand new car, I still get anxious during oil changes like they’re gonna come back and be like yeah it’ll be a grand in repairs today. #nottoday
4288 2018-11-19 16:31:01 @realDonaldTrump Why North Stream are an danger for Germany but TurkStream aren't an danger for Turkey, NATO member? Is time to take monopoly of energy market. Then for America will be easily to control oil exporting countries, to manipulate.
4289 2018-11-19 16:30:59 Venezuelan government controls food distribution.

Expropriations ended a lot of food production. Oil price plummeted so it's costly to import food. Capital controls and corruption make imports more costly.

Price controls restrict stores' ability to resell black market food.
4290 2018-11-19 16:30:41 this nigga just told me $85 for an oil change on my car ...stop playing with me.
4291 2018-11-19 16:30:37 See u jud kay ang imo oil hahaha

4293 2018-11-19 16:30:33 I’m supposed to get an oil change & get on the road & I honestly don’t feel like driving . 
4294 2018-11-19 16:30:33 Poor oil companies. Molested by big bad politicians. It would have been a good idea if they had invested in infrastructure to get their stuff to market as they plunged trillions of dollars- a lot of it ours - into mega projects

4299 2018-11-19 16:30:18 Hi there. Since 2015, we have sourced 100% of our palm oil for our own-label food products from sustainable RSPO-certified sources. We are on track to ensure that 100% of palm oil for our own brand non-food products is sourced from RSPO certified sources by the end of 2018.

4301 2018-11-19 16:30:04 Will the recent reduction of oil prices be of any help?
4302 2018-11-19 16:30:00 CFTC data shows that Hedge Funds are increasing their bearish bets on WTI & Brent, a clear view the OPEC's latest move will fail to stem oil's aggressive plunge since October 3.

4306 2018-11-19 16:29:53 Catalonia is a very different position in regards to economically allowing Scotland to remain in the EU because it wouldn't be outside looking to join it would be a contribution country due to oil funds and EU projects.....but I'm sure you know that 
4307 2018-11-19 16:29:52 @CBCNews @CTVNews @globalhalifax I payed 400$ for oil at Ultramar in Kentville that got sent to my neighbor’s. They are now refusing to do anything about it. Hopefully it doesn’t get cold so my pipes don’t freeze.

4311 2018-11-19 16:29:32 Well, we get bugger all at the moment. Once we are independent any oil and gas in our national areas will be ours.

4322 2018-11-19 16:28:51 And every where it’s tried, it fails! Case in point, Venezuela! A country that was rich in oil, now a total disaster! 
4323 2018-11-19 16:28:48 Keo karpin oil use ചെയ്താലും മതി
4324 2018-11-19 16:28:39 After you walked out, did the service stop? If no, consider yourself nothing and your influence zero!
4325 2018-11-19 16:28:34 Well Trump, and Xi are meeting. China already backed oil imports down and Washington already gave sanction waivers in key sectors of China, so more likely a draw down already started, but Trump did thrraten tariffs on all goods at 25% if he's not happy at G20.
4326 2018-11-19 16:28:29 Which brand of CBD oil do you use?

Said “Doctor, willI ever fing again?”
Said “Doctor, is there nothing I can take?”
“Put the lime in coconut oil and stir it all up.”

4334 2018-11-19 16:27:56 Get rid of Abu Dhabi and stop taking blood mon-I mean oil money for it
4335 2018-11-19 16:27:56 Why would we be paying for oil we're stealing? And I would prefer if we stopped cultivating opiates, so again, it seems like it would be beneficial to both parties if this ended.
4336 2018-11-19 16:27:54 It’s 2026—There is no more oil in MENA. JCPOA is defunct. CNN states #IranGreenDeal saves Iranis from Regime by building giant solar panels in the desert. President Ocasio-Cortez is on FB Live. She says, KD box in hand, “As environmentalists, it’s our duty to support the troops.”

4338 2018-11-19 16:27:46 I'm so happy for you!!! We're going to give a round of it to both of our cats. Although I may make it myself, I noticed you said it was infused in sunflower oil, I just need to get high CBD green if the store ever gets some in again! LOL Or I'll just buy it.
4339 2018-11-19 16:27:34 He does a tight set on Standard Oil's horizontal and vertical integration creating one of the most notable monopolies in American business history. Kills. Then he does airline food.
4340 2018-11-19 16:27:28 At least your bottle of beard oil never got smashed
4341 2018-11-19 16:27:22 We are so happy to see the excitement about us bringing this oil back! Thank you for the re-tweet!
4342 2018-11-19 16:27:21 Medical bills and all that u can call those who have jobs greedy but u can’t call those who live below a dollar in an oil rich nation greedy... I’m not saying it is right but let’s pray we don’t find ourselves in terrible situations
4343 2018-11-19 16:27:15 My house's heating system is fed with wood biomass, which is much more environmentally friendly than gas or oil (which most boilers across the UK use).
4344 2018-11-19 16:27:02 I asked her to go get an oil change... not sure why 4 hours later she still MIA ...
4345 2018-11-19 16:26:42 You basically take all their oil and make crazy profit from it, which is why you refuse to go green and make use of solar power in the states. The least you can do is pay them for the oil, but I wouldn’t expect that from a business owner that refuses to pay half of his employees
4346 2018-11-19 16:26:28 Man. I can't resist the impulse to rant about this. I think it's because tech bros feel very relatable to me. It's like if my friends were doing this. I don't feel that way about Big Oil or weapons makers or whoever.
4347 2018-11-19 16:26:16 If a work in oil paint, could be worth 30 million sterling
Frame extra.
4348 2018-11-19 16:26:13 It's not 2014 anymore, EU & UK are competitors now. An independent Scotland offers the EU a chance to cripple the UK walking away with access to 1/3 of it's landmass, 10% of it's population market, most of it's EEZ sea & 90% of it's oil industry. The UK is in serious trouble..
4349 2018-11-19 16:26:08 Dear all film friends, theater, editing, and art friends in general. I can now not watch a movie without thinking of camera angles, lighting, and background. I can only focus on if they used a water based paint or oil. What I’m trying to say is thank you for making me think
4350 2018-11-19 16:26:04 This perfume bottle make sense oo. Small Vaseline or oil to it

4352 2018-11-19 16:25:45 Anyone currently buying Canadian oil & gas stocks deserve to get smoked! This is the dumbest thing anyone can do. There is no storage capacity in oil or gas! We are at max capacity! Liquids is what companies want right now!

4356 2018-11-19 16:25:12 Definitely an unmatched 1 - 2 punch ! Nothing beats the possibilities and combination of “penetrating oil” and a “film finish” like Bona’s Craft Oil and Traffic HD! NOTHING!!!!
4357 2018-11-19 16:25:08 @IcelandFoods you’ve done great in highlighting issues around single use plastic and palm oil, now to focus on global warming and commit to zero emissions by 2025 #ExtinctionRebellion #ClimateActionNow
4358 2018-11-19 16:25:05 There's a twist in the Muzarabani oil and gas find that sounds more like the mega deals that were announced during the run up to elections. The bubble seems to have burst too soon for some of us who were crafting ways to benefit from the liquid gold.
4359 2018-11-19 16:24:57 We need a president that'll reduce over dependence on oil, adress insecurity, carryout restructuring, make presidency unattractive. #JH

4369 2018-11-19 16:24:06 Add nine pounds of olive oil and bring to a boil.

4372 2018-11-19 16:23:50 The oil companies had a plan to ship through the new pipelines. Companies invested in projects based on the fact pipelines were approved and permitted. Liberals pulled the rug out from under them. Agree post office fiasco is a mess and liberals are proving incompetent to resolve.

4375 2018-11-19 16:23:42 Also due to the lighter crude oil slate over the past few years. Without more heavy coming to the market and the marginal barrel being light sweet then refiners cannot change the direction
4376 2018-11-19 16:23:40 Meanwhile we spend $700BILLION PER YEAR(!) on a military that is merely an “military for hire” for the oil /fossil fuel industry! Pathetic! #militaryindustrialcomplex
4377 2018-11-19 16:23:28 Firming rupee, strong global markets and a dip in crude oil prices from day's high proved to be favorable for the F&O traders on Monday.
4378 2018-11-19 16:23:23 There is also the fact that we are growing less n less dependent on crude oil. Other sectors are doing well.
4379 2018-11-19 16:23:00 The most unlikely everyone is so hot on the palm oil topic i luvit
4380 2018-11-19 16:22:51 Do you think it's kind of sad, we can build a pipeline for oil all the way from Alaska, but we can't build a water line in one state to protect our environment.

4383 2018-11-19 16:22:29 Tulsa is partnering with a private foundation to attract workers who are already cleared by their employers to work remotely from Tulsa for at least one year. Sounds like a great idea to me.
4384 2018-11-19 16:22:21 What if you used the oil company's money to fund research to directly combat climate change?  Does that make a difference?
4385 2018-11-19 16:22:17 I studied zoology and now I work in scientific research into how and why people develop type 2 diabetes. My work has helped me travel and work abroad. My zoology classmates are school teachers, conservationists, ecologists, work in the oil industry and advise on government policy
4386 2018-11-19 16:22:15 Given their general dependence on oil revenues and their oil industry's specific dependence on blends with "sweeter" crudes obtained internationally (Venezuelan oil is abundant but poor in quality), their economy collapsed.

4390 2018-11-19 16:22:00 German auto makers getting called out. If Germany can produce some cool EVs to sell to the global market then it would help reduce the need to rely on Russia to supply oil and gas to Europe.

4404 2018-11-19 16:21:09 My 90-year old mom, life-long proud Christian Republican, just asked me to tweet you on her behalf and say, "RESIGN." You only appeal to the immoral, hypocritical factions in the USA.  Your snake oil is rancid to the rest of us.  And, may I add, #LockHimUp
4405 2018-11-19 16:21:09 I just paid $17 for a bottle of good olive oil, so that represents a mark-up of less than 400%.  The hospital is clearly not trying hard enough.

4408 2018-11-19 16:21:04 Uncomfortable questions should be asked about all religions. all cheeks of the same arse spewing out snake oil excrement. All as barbaric and deadly as each other. You can't criticise one religion without criticising the others. Then it just becomes bigotry
4409 2018-11-19 16:21:04 It will be very interesting to see if renewables can survive without massive government subsidies. Oil and gas is still far more affordable for many users. That economic disparity is the heart of the matter. Among other issues.
4410 2018-11-19 16:21:02 Oil fans deserve better than this management needs a major shakeup along with the roster. Basically another rebuild should be in play. Only untouchables should be #29 and #97

4414 2018-11-19 16:20:26 Hair oil. Argan. Coconut. Maracuja. Olive. Take your pick!
Work in just a little from the ends up- frizz free.
4415 2018-11-19 16:20:19 Some are demanding a repo rate cut--based on lower oil prices and lower than expected CPI print.
4416 2018-11-19 16:20:16 I don't know any of the people you are talking about, that are doing well.
In the end, it's all about the facts. Fact is, the rest of the world is developing their oil reserves at a massive rate, the rest of the world does not impose carbon taxes on themselves. We are.
4417 2018-11-19 16:20:10 This is a country with third highest oil reserves...
4418 2018-11-19 16:20:08 If we had stronger reserves from higher oil prices but lost majority of it to corrupt individuals or excesses, do you think it would have been possible for the CBN to still defend the currency at N360/$ now that we are facing lower oil price and increased capital outflow.

4420 2018-11-19 16:20:05 Im pretty sure the gas problem is a legislative thing, I mean isn't it way easier to get oil out of the ground today with all the technological advances than it was 20 years ago

4423 2018-11-19 16:19:54 Yes, but also more. They nationalized industries like oil, causing massive productivity drops as they replaced executives with cronies. Exchange rate controls created a scarce official market for international trade. Media takeovers limited access to information.

4431 2018-11-19 16:19:11 I only need to shower before going into the pool if I haven’t bathed that day.
     *All swimmers should shower before entering the pool. Perspiration, body oil, urine, and other waste are with us at all times. Without showering, it all comes with us when we go swimming.

4437 2018-11-19 16:18:43 I’m curious what these oil executives and fund managers think is the silver bullet? They act like Trudeau is the only PM we’ve had for the last 30 years. He just paid $4.5 billion to prop up the industry. #cdnpoli #tarsands
4438 2018-11-19 16:18:41 I now understand the deal, since the time PMB asked that 'where is the power' OBJ is having sleepless nights because he is sure that if PMB is re-elected, he must vomit that 16B or got jailed.

4441 2018-11-19 16:18:23 A quick update from @HuskyEnergy regarding the SeaRose spill.

Husky is trying to complete its ROV survey today. They still haven't confirmed whether it's just a "batch spill" or if more oil is leaking, however no additional oil has been spotted on the surface. #nlpoli

4444 2018-11-19 16:17:49 I didn't see that. Fair enough.
In typical political fashion volte face has not been limited to Leave supporting factions however.
International trade is an oil tanker - it won't turn at the speeds of politicians on a campaign.

4446 2018-11-19 16:17:43 How about we have civil servants and not these over entitled civil kings in office.  Their pay should be capped as well as campaign funds. Corporations and big oil and Pharma shouldn't be allowed to contribute either.

4449 2018-11-19 16:17:07 It doesn't weigh on them a bit. Everyone in oil industry (440,000 jobs lost) looking for return to high oil prices, regardless of what oil does to environment; familes to feed. Most would join #greenrevolution if jobs.

4478 2018-11-19 16:14:37 I actually am. Unfortunately that's the case of dealing with it because I know it and then what is on ground is the exact opposite. What happened to the cheap oil from Saudi Arabia?

4482 2018-11-19 16:14:11 Big Oil laughing all the way to the bank over that “NG as a bridge fuel” PR ploy. So long as the bank isn’t on the coast or in a town wiped out by a catastrophic wildfire. 

Might be (past) time to apply climate science and math to the shale fracking boom.

4503 2018-11-19 16:13:04 Don’t get dependent on it too much. You’ll have a hard time falling asleep without it. 

I’d highly recommend CBD oil (no THC). I’d suggest the small capsules.

4510 2018-11-19 16:12:25 Yup, in the years ago of record high oil prices and record gas prices at the pump.  Oil companies still made record breaking profits.   It's a racket and cartel,  owning both parties in Gov't.
4511 2018-11-19 16:12:25 “So we are..” choose response.. a. Doing nothing b. Doing nothing but in a louder voice c. Doing nothing, but we’ll repeat our new found outrage many times d. Cancelling all future arms deals, recalling ambassador, and ceasing all oil imports.

4513 2018-11-19 16:12:15 Your latest tweet is becoming balanced as well! Here in Vietnam we really respect India, large population being vegetarian, never being greedy, Indian remains the firm investor in oil and gas exploration in SCS alongside with Vietnam, while Western retreated.
4514 2018-11-19 16:12:14 Kalo aer biasa emang ga bisa. That's why now days women need micellar water/ cleansing oil and always double cleansing~
4515 2018-11-19 16:12:09 That is simply not true on all fronts. Oil Sands oil using modern SAGD methods is comparative in terms of CO2 generation when you look at the entire process. Your states are out of date. And yes, we have consumers, we just can't reach them due to foreign NGO interference.
4516 2018-11-19 16:12:04 Sounds good. There is a product I was skeptical about. Recently had some essential oil residue (not on babes ). Used NPK power wash. It is 99.9997% water. Water the f**ck that .0003 % is washed the oil right off the leaves. Now I know better. Learning process .

4523 2018-11-19 16:11:01 Let me know how you like it. I just got some killer za'atar to add to olive oil at the World Fair down at the Presbyterian Church this weekend.  It is made by a women's cooperative in Palestine.

4547 2018-11-19 16:08:51 I think that's where the Kennedy's got their start too. The father did a lot of dealing in Germany during the war. One of Gladwell's books talks about how being of a certain age at a certain point in time leads to clumps of barons in specific areas, oil, computers, etc.

4553 2018-11-19 16:08:27 There was only a brief recession and plunging world price of oil in 2015, so yeah, the forecasts were off.
The Conservatives also booked savings in the budget that didn’t come to pass (Shared Services, Phoenix payroll).
4554 2018-11-19 16:08:23 On the road too a healthy lifestyle, you could do a lot  worst than using coconut oil, just make sure it's organic.

4559 2018-11-19 16:08:04 I have an idea that those who worked on this policy document of 2019-2025 must have been a member of beer barn at one time or the other. Only if u know u know bcos oil number production per day will never reach that figure mentioned looking at our circumstances.
4560 2018-11-19 16:07:57 I think climate change is the result of a number of factors: depleting oil from the Earth, increased radiation from man made and Solar sources, and population expansion without replanting trees etc.
4561 2018-11-19 16:07:55 Love her proposal to help people change cars to electric ones... Mind you, I use collective transport despite having a car ... And that's true. We must leave our dependency on oil. The quicker the better!

4580 2018-11-19 16:05:51 @tvcnewsng All Atiku is focused on is selling refineries and oil licensing to cronies. That is a cheap vision. Dangote is already building a refinery that will produce more products than all our 4 refineries combined.#JH

4583 2018-11-19 16:05:09 Think of the Trump communication team as Snake Oil marketers.

If things get worse...Not enough Snake Oil was used!

Can you please send me a return method.

4595 2018-11-19 16:03:57 These are basic assessment, which to be honest anyone can do. The PS is merely pointing out that the FGS should not be signing oil deals when it lacks the necessary institutions and laws.
4596 2018-11-19 16:03:52 Good luck with that. Unfortunately they won't give you priority if you don't fall into a vulnerable category...might be worth investing in an oil filled radiator!
4597 2018-11-19 16:03:50 Hi there! Just in case you decide to order one, you don't have to register it to a vehicle. You can keep it as a collector item! If you plan to use it on a vehicle, it must be registered the same way as other Alberta plates, so standard registration and exchange fees will apply
4598 2018-11-19 16:03:32 If you're mad Bombardier got a loan, it's the height of hypocrisy to expect an oil bailout.  Oilsands companies can build pipelines.  They don't want to because it's not profitable. They want taxpayers to pay for it. They can build their own refineries & build their own pipelines
4599 2018-11-19 16:03:28 If my partner says pls do not touch that & I still touch it. Its basically means I don't give a flying fuck of his opinions/feelings. I just plain disrespect him. Cherry on top I start filming while he is going through that hurt. Added oil to it.
4600 2018-11-19 16:03:26 oil, you attack consumption, not production. Stop going to Mexico every year, stop getting plastic grocery bags, live in an apartment building that is more efficient to heat than a house, live close to work and walk or bike, and eat local foods.

4632 2018-11-19 15:59:57 Oil prices are falling so low that pretty soon it will be a good deal just for the barrel.
4633 2018-11-19 15:59:49 Mambilla Hydro awarded without payoffs to them.
Railway projects awarded same way, some running through Abeokuta.
Oil bloc licenses belonging to IBB, OBJ, Danjuma aren't getting renewed.
These are a few reasons why they don't rate him and it was all done on the aAPC platform.

4635 2018-11-19 15:59:46 Homs is in rubble, Daraa partially too as large parts of Deir Ezzor.
Or again, Ghouta & EAleppo.
No cash to rebuild it ($400bln are needed)
Big oil fields are in DFNS areas (lije the al-Omar one).

4637 2018-11-19 15:59:39 How many of you arse holes read TTIP?
Yet you were all prepared to sign it, not knowing what was in it??
How many read Maastricht or Lisbon Treaties??

THIS IS WHY WE'RE IN THIS MESS!
You all thought we'd not notice getting our arse smacked without the baby oil!
4638 2018-11-19 15:59:37 Trump’s a salesman selling snake oil door-to-door. He’s a PR guy. If his fans were all dolphins, he’d be throwing Trump Herring imported from China into a frothing pool of dolphins in the Pacific. The medium is just a tool for him. For AOC, the medium is just breathing air.
4639 2018-11-19 15:59:36 @lileverywhere when your friend says she only buys from mlms to support her friends and believes one oil is great bc it’s fda approved.  #mlm #thedreampodcast

4642 2018-11-19 15:59:32 ...Or is it because you are swayed by more powerful organisations who continue to use non-sustainable Palm Oil and will suffer financial loss through this advert???

4649 2018-11-19 15:59:05 thanks for sharing @genscape. is that total liquids or just oil?
4650 2018-11-19 15:59:01 Nice! A good oil to stick the herbs, spices and flavours to the wedges is absolutely key 
4651 2018-11-19 15:58:59 so I'm not taking the moral high ground here, just saying that is a farcical representation of the numbers.
As for ethics, oil has lifted billions out of poverty by providing cheap, dense, transportable energy to all. Homes can be heated, food can be mass produced and sent...

4656 2018-11-19 15:58:27 I heard that some palm oil is being declared in products as "vegetable oil"  That needs stopping.

4659 2018-11-19 15:58:14 What you need is a set of valve cover gaskets,a rotary button,an alternator and two quarts of oil.That should fix that corn right up.
4660 2018-11-19 15:58:02 Obviously it’s a positive thing that more people are aware of the poor uses of palm oil. But you can’t tell me that Trisha, 18, from Bradford gave a shit about the orangutans until she saw Iceland,James corden and Charlotte Crosby bang on about it on Twitter

4666 2018-11-19 15:57:36 Started as a result of global market prices for oil, but this Government failed to tackle it immediately and it for worse.  Afterall, we aint the only oil producing Nation. An Ngozi Nkojo-Iweala wont lead us here.
4667 2018-11-19 15:57:28 f you want  flavor, you have to heat to extract the oil from the seeds.

4669 2018-11-19 15:57:22 What we share with the Saudis is oil reserves. That's it. Also, this study states that Canadian policy will drive 5C change but Indian policy will account for only 2C. Does it need explaining how clearly wrong that is? They're a developing country with 35 times our population,...
4670 2018-11-19 15:57:21 I’d like to be as blind to the truth as Susie is, but my parents raised me right. They told me to watch out for those who look like snake oil salesmen and who project their crimes and wrongdoing onto other people. They are the true criminals. Susie must love criminals.
4671 2018-11-19 15:57:20 I’ve done it both ways. If you heat it, don’t heat past 200, olive oil can scorch. Heating speeds it up. I usually just fill this with olive oil, several cloves of garlic and whatever else I want (herbs, etc). It takes a couple of weeks to gain good flavor.  Cont’d...

Afterwards, buy 1500 cars for chiefs, loot diamonds, built hospitals by going to SA. new dispensation!
4674 2018-11-19 15:56:52 In Greece, the cook at my fave taverna didn't mind at all when I stood for an hour or so and watched her cook. And it's basic and delicious, like aubergine slices (the speckled, thin sort, but it works with the 'normal') fried in olive oil with a sauce of fried tomato paste ...

4687 2018-11-19 15:55:11 Ppl from Mexico are of a different culture. e.g. “Mordito”. The oil that makes everything work-the bribe, the little bite. Everyone like the phone Co, utility Co and particularly the local cops “expect” a bribe for service. Offer a cop a bribe in America and your headed for jail.

4698 2018-11-19 15:54:38 Also most of the store caters for meat eaters & we have one freezer with stuff in. Shocking considering the support Iceland gets from vegans all year round. You pride in your no palm oil promotion but still promote the slaughter of millions of animals for consumption
4699 2018-11-19 15:54:37 It’s not mostly desert it’s Quneitra, Dar’aa, Sweida, Damascus, Hama, Homs, Tartus, Latakia, Aleppo, Palmyra, Deir Ez Zor, Al-Mayadin & Abu Kamal. So it’s the majority of the major cities. Most are not rubble I can tell you that & there are oil fields near Palmyra & Deir Ez Zor

4705 2018-11-19 15:53:41 She absolutely is. And right now she is introducing legislation that will make it impossible to bring Medicare for all to the floor. She takes money from big oil and big Pharma. She’s not progressive.

4709 2018-11-19 15:53:18 Another hint: keep a bottle of sesame oil around. A couple of drops in a clear soup is adding a bit of sunshine. Learned from a Chinese neighbour.
4710 2018-11-19 15:52:56 Try cmd oil.
4711 2018-11-19 15:52:50 Learn what? How to take money from big oil and Pharma? How to block Medicare for all? I don’t want anyone learning any of that

4726 2018-11-19 15:51:21 Vou te dar 1 (um) exemplo de regulação pra você aprender: Standard Oil era a maior petroleira do mundo, virou um monopólio. Governo LIBERAL do EUA fez uma REGULAÇÃO para garantir a concorrência e a quebrou em 10 empresas. Ganhou a sociedade, o consumidor e o Estado. Um abraço.

4730 2018-11-19 15:51:06 She spoke of compromising with fascists. She wants to work with people locking up kids in cages? Disregarding climate change? Plus she takes a lot of Big Pharma and Oil and Gas money. The status quo got us Trump. We want, #BarbaraLeeForSpeaker. Can’t play the race or sexism card.
4731 2018-11-19 15:50:45 Alaska residents receive oil royalty payments -- perhaps people are more open to wealth-sharing in states where natural resource extraction is a major source of income, rather than entrepreneurial/corporate innovation and manufacturing labor.
4732 2018-11-19 15:50:44 And they continue to tell people that what they ship to the US is "oil". It is bitumen. A nasty cocktail of chemicals with a bit of oil mixed in that simply cannot be cleaned up if it spills in either soil or water. And they won't clean it up, that cuts into profits.

4767 2018-11-19 15:47:47 Iran hosts about 7% of the world’s mineral resource, including 10% of proven oil and 16% of natural gas reserves. The nation’s total gold deposits are estimated at 320 tons. Also massive zinc, copper and iron deposits.

That's why the US is after Iran.
4768 2018-11-19 15:47:44 You want to keep the world dependent on ME oil & Russian gas.  Make us all poorer.  Forget it James.  When people can make their own or use greener alternatives.  Your system of making us dependent on markets and politics is over.
4769 2018-11-19 15:47:40 Lol but I know you'll do it fr Allah's sake 
4770 2018-11-19 15:47:32 Alright, I'm definitely going to be trying out both. The gummies are on sale online right now but I don't know where to get the oil, I'm guessing it's pretty pricey. Lol
4771 2018-11-19 15:47:29 she took seven figures from big Pharma last cycle, she takes money from big oil, and just now is trying to force legislation that will make it impossible to bring Medicare for all to the floor. She sucks
4772 2018-11-19 15:47:28 No protective puts at this crazy crude oil/ nat gas ratio ?
4773 2018-11-19 15:47:26 Do you make your own infused oil, or do you purchase it?

4781 2018-11-19 15:46:36 @realDonaldTrump I still think the 911 attack on America by Bin Laden was planned with some high ranking Americans. America knows these figures. It was all about Oil & Arms. George Bush should explain to the world what really the interest was. Who Backed OSAMA on American Soil!?
4782 2018-11-19 15:46:35 When does Cdn oil sales price go below the cost of producing oil.  His is a major crisis in Canada but Liverals dont care

4786 2018-11-19 15:46:13 saw something on snapchat that said to put a mixture of honey, coconut oil, and tea tree oil on a fresh tattoo to make it heal faster and that seems like the worst fucking idea
4787 2018-11-19 15:46:11 This is the narrative that your President wants you to believe - that he has control over oil prices

He doesn't

If he did they wouldn't have gone up 50% from Jan - Oct 2018 

Maybe the other 2 do, but your guy ? Nope.
4788 2018-11-19 15:45:33 This isn't Trinidad. We don't have oil money
4789 2018-11-19 15:45:33 Why are we shipping it anywhere, then? We don't even burn our own oil...
4790 2018-11-19 15:45:29 I didn’t know untill lately that you order amazing olive oil from Palestine, I need to order some soon I’m almost out.
4791 2018-11-19 15:45:19 While OPEC struggles to find common purpose, the U.S., Russia and Saudi Arabia dominate global supply. Together they produce more oil than the 15 members of OPEC.
4792 2018-11-19 15:44:57 What about the land route to supply tons of oil, shipments, armaments etc.?

4797 2018-11-19 15:44:41 We need to find another way in! The draw bridge is blocked by people unhappy with deforestation for palm oil groves!

4800 2018-11-19 15:44:33 There has been no hike in petrol/diesel pump taxes since Jan when they rose by 8c a litre for diesel and 4c for 95 sans-plomb. Pump prices peaked at over Euros 1.50 and are now down in the Euro 1.40s, because oil price fell. Of 30c or so rise in diesel in 2018, 8c is due to taxes
4801 2018-11-19 15:44:27 I would also like to add that the government has 100/200 billion dollars of taxes payers money on a YEARLY bases that is used in DEEPBLACK budget research. This is all intractable. Research that would eradicate common diseases, air&water pollution, Middle Eastern oil use, so on.

4810 2018-11-19 15:43:54 We were talking tax collection, not GDP.  Texas got an artificial boost  to GDP growth because of rising oil price.

4816 2018-11-19 15:43:34 USD-CAD fell from session highs of 1.3202, trading to 1.3175. Earlier gains came as WTI crude prices fell over $1/bbl to $55.28, though USD weakness after the soft housing market index allowed the Loonie to bounce. The weaker USD also helped oil prices rally back over $56.45.

4819 2018-11-19 15:43:18 Except oil. Like literally tons upon tons of oil.

4821 2018-11-19 15:43:17 It's that image thing: Texas rangers, longhorns, oil barons. It seems iconically western. I also think most Americans have absolutely no understanding of geography. If you say you're from Québec and pronounce it correctly, people just stare at you as if you said Ulan Bator.

4830 2018-11-19 15:42:25 But if done gradually and with the knowledge that there are plenty of replacements should be fine. We're not talking about an abrupt oil shock we're talking about gradual internalization of unpriced costs as well as putting areas off limits for exploration.

4905 2018-11-19 15:35:40 I don't think so. The Foreign Reserve has been grown to about $47b...should this govt be replaced by the PDP, that money will be looted again. We've seen that happened in the past. GEJ depleted The FR despite higher oil revenue. We've travelled the road of d PDP b4 for 16 years
4906 2018-11-19 15:35:28 Oil pastel sticks. Very colorful and better coverage than pencils. Any paper is fine but the art tablet kind with a bit of texture holds better than copy paper. Pastel pencils are good though for detail work as opposed to blocks of color.
4907 2018-11-19 15:35:21 NAFTA no longer exists.

Federal Reserve, a privately owned company, sets interest rates.

Too hard to say what is with NK.

Oil price drops = cheaper gas.

We withdrew from TPP.

I know it won't effect your opinion, though. The idea that Trump being bad is so deeply entrenched.
4908 2018-11-19 15:35:20 Carrick doesn’t qualify for cannabis oil, I’m rather happy about this as his neurologist explained those who do qualify, my heart goes out to them and I’m blessed with a semi healthy child.

4910 2018-11-19 15:35:16 We’re currently paying Saudi Arabia tons of money for oil and providing them with arms deals while they murder journalists. Fool...

4916 2018-11-19 15:34:54 The Nigerian music industry is the real oil we talk about..it truly is a combination of hardwork(hustle) & creativity. We are still exploring.. the sounds I come across makes me smile. All you unknowns keep doing your thing the world has a strange way of blessing you!

4918 2018-11-19 15:34:48 Thank you very, very much on this balanced opinion! 

As a Malaysian, oil palm was one commodity that helped lift millions of farmers out of poverty post-independence. 

Good thing now is we’re actually going to diversify away from this crop to much more valuable fruits.

4921 2018-11-19 15:34:19 After spending a weekend in NYC I can confidently say I remain unimpressed with the snake oil y'all keep trying to sell me about why it's so much better to live there. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

4927 2018-11-19 15:33:52 Manufacturing, agriculture, and oil production has been taken from the companies and placed under workers councils or co-managed enterprises (see Alcasa) under both Chavez and Maduro. Those three industries alone account for 40% of Venezualas economy.
4928 2018-11-19 15:33:44 Unfortunately the billions $ sent to Venezuela is sent to their oil company..owned and controlled by the government. And still their people flee..insufficient food, medicine, repression. It’s what a sick ideology always delivers.
4929 2018-11-19 15:33:43 Honda said my Blower Motor Resistor was the cause of my heater not working. Extended warranty covers that. I'm also getting the oil changed and brakes done.

My apartment office called saying they got my message and will send maintenance out to fix my heater.

Just some effort. 

All ingredients from the garden except the oil which @tasteofgame kindly sent us.  It is so nice that I like to use for meals we prepare that deserve something special.
4932 2018-11-19 15:33:38 I used to use the ones from Victoria Secret religiously. The Body Shop has some really good ones too (especially the mango scent!). Josie Maran’s whipped argan oil body butter is what I’m on currently! Loveeee it!

4934 2018-11-19 15:33:32 We didn’t go after Osama Bin Laden because Republicans led by George Bush and faulty intelligence used it as a reason to invade the Middle East packedaged in a short sighted plan with oil to pay for it

4938 2018-11-19 15:33:10 I don’t think you’re right! Obama still my forever president! I voted for Gillum and guess what I am a white woman. But in my view no matter what is your skin color, only matter what you do. And also I am not happy what is happening right now but your comment just oil on the fire
4939 2018-11-19 15:33:00 I pray that the oil works!!

4944 2018-11-19 15:32:20 Typical response of the Left. If it’s not Voter Suppresion it’s Race etc.

The truth be told’ it obvious Voter Suppresion and Fraud was used against the Right’ again!
4945 2018-11-19 15:32:11 Oh, 100% agree with you there. CBD oil is great as well.. needs to get some more. 
4946 2018-11-19 15:32:04 What do you mean by revenue has depleted despite oil price increase,please follow Custom and Firs and confirm sir...

Nigeria is simply on the rise and double digital inflation is because we just exit recession. .

4973 2018-11-19 15:30:05 The stupidity of Socialism in one Tweet. If you don't want to live in a cave, oil and gas are NECESSITIES. Sell or DESTROY your car, your computer, ANYTHING you use that has plastic, THEN we will consider you sincere. The fact that you're TWEETING is outright HYPOCRISY.
4974 2018-11-19 15:30:01 There are thousands of BYU super fans like Eldon in Utah CO. Best chance to find one is at a local ice cream joint or one of the many food storage businesses.

4977 2018-11-19 15:29:35 What is stopping you is the environmental resistance. You don’t support a commitment to mitigating climate change, so what do you expect? Support carbon pricing and we can form a national purpose to pipe your oil to tidewater. #skpoli

4995 2018-11-19 15:27:44 The biggest crime of conservatives is they fight every effort 2 preserve & protect our beautiful nature from developers & polluters.  They ban climate science, protect Big Oil.  As long as a politician says the magic words promising anti-choice on abortion & pro- guns they're OK.
4996 2018-11-19 15:27:25 27!!!!!!
4997 2018-11-19 15:27:16 How much does the "polluter pay" for dumping 250,000 litres of oil into the ocean off Newfoundland @nrcan @cathmckenna ? I'm guessing nothing for damages and much less than the price of that oil in fines.

Korean skin care uses an oil cleanser followed by a water/foam cleanser to double cleanse. Look into the sheet masks tho, they’re life changing.

5022 2018-11-19 15:24:17 It don’t have to be a war like conditions Italy will need every USD it can get their hands on to pay for it (since no one is likely to accept lira) US might be willing to pay them for a lease of Venice but Italy imports 1.15 mbpd (a.k.a 69 Million USD/ day) of oil...
5023 2018-11-19 15:24:17 Dunno what this stocks ratio of oil v gas plays is, but maybe its just #PriceofOil taking its toll as it has done on so many oilers? Still tough & a seemingly ridiculous daily fall to compromise.

5030 2018-11-19 15:23:10 There is complete govt control of manufacturing, agriculture, and oil.

I'll make it easy to understand: if person A owns an oil company, but the govt controls the price of oil, the wages for employees, the output/production, that oil company is in a socialist environ
5031 2018-11-19 15:23:09 I know about the regional pricing differences in oil. Your problem is that you couldn't recognize the market's inability to decipher that...and that you bet on the QC gov't and blame them for being dumb when it's your fault for betting on the QC gov't in the first place.

5039 2018-11-19 15:21:59 If we go by your analysis historically:

First you said crude oil prices will break the backbone of Modi govt : Impact None or partial
Second you argued about Rafale that too now going down by drain 
Now you've a new theory w.r.t CBI..That too will go down the drain Mr. Coupta!!

5041 2018-11-19 15:21:48 This is why he pulled out of the Iran deal (that was working) to reinstate sanctions for the Saudis could sell more oil.

He doesn't care how many children they bomb, or starve in Yemen. He sure as hell doesn't care about a dead journalist.

5043 2018-11-19 15:21:46 Oil fell on Monday, surrendering earlier gains as investors weighed up  the effectiveness of a potential cut in supply from OPEC and possibly  other exporters in the face of rapidly rising global output.

5047 2018-11-19 15:21:22 Thanks :) I've been painting with oil for years, just discovered how much fun acrylic is. Just got on ig and will likely be bored with it by the end of the month.

5049 2018-11-19 15:21:00 Where's is the $80 million dollar #China paid your #TPLF thugs.? Btw, do you know how many innocent lives you guys killed near the oil field area?. Of course you don't care.
5050 2018-11-19 15:20:59 my first move today is a oil change.
5051 2018-11-19 15:20:40 The British government is as bad, they are worried about losing money on oil and arms deals. Everything is about money, it's reprehensible

5054 2018-11-19 15:20:33 A recent rise in the dollar and oversupply concerns have dented some of the enthusiasm for the energy sector. U.S. oil prices have tumbled 26% from their Oct. 3 high and recently suffered their longest losing streak since 1983 amid worries of excess supply.

5084 2018-11-19 15:17:35 Fact: the Liberal government didn't even ask that US and Mexico implement a carbon tax as part of NAFTA negotiations. It's almost like they want to bankrupt Alberta, send oil and gas stateside.

5087 2018-11-19 15:17:11 Aha, wrong sort of oil. I'm just getting so much from hemp oils and creams but yeah not necessarily what Ash needs.
5088 2018-11-19 15:16:54 Oh and since we're going to be all about "America first" perhaps we should discuss where exactly we're going to get enough oil & natural resources to keep our country self sustainable since the administration won't be doing business with countries who don't want "America first."

5090 2018-11-19 15:16:47 Applying oil to the beard is such a marvellous feeling. The scent, the silky smoothness of the hairs.

5096 2018-11-19 15:16:25 Is it cheaper to get an oil change and have them find my oil leak, or take it to the shop to have them just locate the oil leak?
5097 2018-11-19 15:16:25 Every article I’m reading says that oil is going lower
5098 2018-11-19 15:16:15 Also they have a 25% VAT which increases prices for consumers, drill for oil like banshees, and EVERYONE pays the high personal tax rates of 39-60% not only the top earners in America.  So in Bernie's world he wants to raise the taxes substantially for the lower 50% of taxpayers.
5099 2018-11-19 15:16:14 Are you suggesting we go back to trading cattle, bushels of wheat, jars of oil, bolts of cloth, etc?

5110 2018-11-19 15:15:09 Oil is down 28% from its Oct peak & lumber future prices down 54% from their peak earlier this year yet the Fed continues to worry far more about inflation than the rising risks of deflation. Amazing how the Fed is still haunted by the ghosts of the early 1980's inflation cycle.

5113 2018-11-19 15:14:56 l'ecologie doit etre prise en compte d'une façon planetaire, cela tombe sous le sens, nous faire croire que les taxes sur le gaz oil sont faites pour cela releve de l'utopie,elles vont créer un ralentissement sensible de l'economie du a la montee des prix,sans vrai impact ecolo!
5114 2018-11-19 15:14:34 Don't act as a puppet of american war criminals;come to a peace talks with Iran&make middle east peaceful and happy.remember,american praised you just for your oil.
5115 2018-11-19 15:14:32 And then there are oddballs like Norway where large % of GDP is temporary (oil revenues), i.e., permanent income levels of residents lower conditional on GDP.  They can't really spend like their GDP would imply (in the long run) +
5116 2018-11-19 15:14:21 I went to the shop to get my oil changed even tho I know there’s a million and one problems with my car so I really hope the just change my oil and don’t make me pay $400 for any other shit
5117 2018-11-19 15:14:21 just finessed the guy doing my oil change into giving me a new filter and tire rotation for free 
5118 2018-11-19 15:14:18 Wow, still see many in denial over this #oil move into the 50’s. I’ve seen some go as far as claiming it’s a stop run? LOL - in all seriousness a large move like this only indicates further weakness as funds are hesitant to add longs for now #oott
5119 2018-11-19 15:14:06 So... who am I suppose to be rooting for here? OPEC? Oil companies? Or consumers at the gas pump? Maybe we should all be rooting for a fossil-fuel-free innovation that makes all Big Oil obsolete.
5120 2018-11-19 15:14:04 They're too busy filing suit against the oil industry, the plastic cup industry, the plastic straw industry, the red meat industry, etc., etc., etc.

5132 2018-11-19 15:11:59 10 | investing in future demand growth is another. Our analysis shows that discoveries of new oil resources fell to another record low in 2017, with less than 4 billion barrels of crude, condensate and NGLs found.

5150 2018-11-19 15:09:39 FYI, even the low-iq environmentalist are now changing their tune, So I know you can handle learning too. FYI not all environmentalist are mentally challenged, but lately the liberal ones are... block pipelines and instead pollute the world with trucks and trains to move the oil

SALSA would be AMAZING - all kinds of salsa. Think things that help save bland food. International stuff. 2/

5184 2018-11-19 15:05:03 Trump & Lifeless man are in the same age bracket.
US under Trump grew the US from world's number ONE biggest oil consumer in the world to world's biggest oil producer.

NGA under PMB got from the Giant of Africa to the most corrupt & under developing country

5186 2018-11-19 15:05:02 I cooked them in a cast iron skillet with olive oil
5187 2018-11-19 15:05:00 What about Venezuela? where these services are paid with crude oil and products, PDVSA participation in Cien Fuegos refinery was taken by Cuba. It is not just affecting Cuban Doctors rights but also affecting Venezuelan people. How much are Venezuelans being charged for this?
5188 2018-11-19 15:04:55 Do you know what the panels that photovoltaic #solar cells are mounted in are made of?

5189 2018-11-19 15:04:44 so check it, a quarter cup of olive oil, the juice of a whole lemon, salt, pepper, and oregano to taste, and a dab of minced garlic. Mix it, and then pour it over the lamb chops and let them marinate for at least half an hour or overnight refrigerated.
5190 2018-11-19 15:04:32 i just put rinsed kimchi, flour, lil bit water + soy souce (or salt) plus sesame oil  and mix them together!
5191 2018-11-19 15:04:32 それはどーかはわかんない笑
5192 2018-11-19 15:04:21 9/10 people going nuts about palm oil being bad for orangutans are still happy for other animals to be tortured and killed so they can eat them. Idgi
5193 2018-11-19 15:04:20 Yes! But be sure to wear a full suit of armor and also maybe do it outside. Armor protects against boiling oil right? Don’t forget your gauntlets!
5194 2018-11-19 15:04:16 @BenChilwell You're a great player but sort your hair out mate. You look like a sea bird that's been caught in an oil spill
5195 2018-11-19 15:04:00 I will never forgive my mum for waking me up early during Lidl sales to buy oil and rice for the house cause there was a limit on how much one person could buy
5196 2018-11-19 15:03:56 So Nutella contains palm oil.. gutted! 
5197 2018-11-19 15:03:39 Don't like oil here as I am not a "double bottom" guy although it does work sometimes.  Just not my style.
5198 2018-11-19 15:03:35 Agreed but as of this moment, they actually have three but to expect Chiasson to continue on anything close to the pace he is on isn't realistic. Hence,  the "argue" angle ;)
5199 2018-11-19 15:03:31 What deal can work for UK except the hope of murdering more Biafrans to convert their land to oil fields, or manufacturing more atrocities from Jubril Aminu of Sudan, in replacement of the dead @MBuhari, so as to retain the stranglehold on the Biafra OIL AND GAS? Britain is evil
5200 2018-11-19 15:03:23 Finally got on the CBD oil train and my backs been feeling pretty damn good

5205 2018-11-19 15:02:56 Bro she came in trying to get an oil change on her lunch break and got pissed when it wasn’t fast enough. Not my fault she stupid as hell
5206 2018-11-19 15:02:54 Falling oil prices has more to do with excessive production (supply) than with flagging economic demand. OPEC has produced 32 million/bbls/day since June with no plans to trim output. The US oil rig count is 886 +20% higher than last year- Jack Ablin, as reported in Barron's
5207 2018-11-19 15:02:50 I just read the most extraordinary undergraduate student essay on the ideology of #TrinidadandTobago, oil and cryptocurrency mining. Fantastic mix of energy economics and Marxist analysis of extraction economies. We have good students @UWI_StAugustine

5215 2018-11-19 15:02:10 Put away the anointing oil.  It's one game against an historically terrible organization.  Gettleman has done much more harm than good since his arrival. Hog mollies, my ass.  They're more Molly than hogs.
5216 2018-11-19 15:02:08 Well, the big s*** is taking his clown and snake oil show to Mississippi!  Drink the Kool Aid folks!  There’s one born every minute. Bet your fourth graders are smarter than he is.
5217 2018-11-19 15:02:05 And given the increasing effectiveness of the snake oil sales pitch for socialism to ppl with a huge sense of entitlement, she could win.

5221 2018-11-19 15:01:37 Dale,  Please explain your accusation, how and why the topic direction & outcome belongs to you.

Is the Canada oil price differentiation really a simple factor of supply & demand, as you suggest?

Why so much blunt edges. Are you somebody's troll in a suit?

5224 2018-11-19 15:01:00 @winnerfordDE how long does it take to do an oil change? 2 hours and still waiting.

5226 2018-11-19 15:00:58 Travis and I routinely talk about how our coffee talks like gasoline. But the grime around the mug does add a sentimental level of "crude oil" to it. It's an acquired taste.
5227 2018-11-19 15:00:55 Whenever I’m at a “10 minute” oil change place and it starts running long I have to resist copping an attitude. Drain the oil, fill the oil boss let’s go!

5233 2018-11-19 15:00:36 Jason Kenney is sitting on all that oil. Right now the stuff is almost worthless, selling for $13.46 a barrel, because it costs $$$$$$ to ship it by train. So what if it costs about $60 a barrel to produce? He would roll barrels down the Trans-Canada hwy if it would get a vote.

5269 2018-11-19 14:56:44 You could try mixing some honey with your oil cleanser and see if that works or 1 part liquid hand soap to 2 parts water then attempt to clean it that way. Thats if you haven't already tried them.

5312 2018-11-19 14:51:50 There plain old aren't enough quality coffee shops in Windsor. We are overrun by the vermin of that Burger King owned mudwater and palm oil franchise.

5314 2018-11-19 14:51:29 It just pisses me right off. 

What happends in 5-10 days when we find birds and sea life dead in mass... will he tell us that it’s not related to the oil spill

5318 2018-11-19 14:51:05 You have a clearer conscience supporting purchase of oil that helps fund human rights abuses? 
Perhaps I haven't heard of all the good that Saudi Arabia and Iran are doing with their oil dollars but Canadian oil is much more ethical.

5320 2018-11-19 14:50:52 If a knew they were cumin up this way I’d be boiling some oil 
5321 2018-11-19 14:50:50 I’m waiting for my car to be done with an oil change and a dog walks in and her name is GRAVY.
5322 2018-11-19 14:50:37 The price of crude oil has dropped 19% in the past 30 days to $56 per barrel. And with it, the national average price of gasoline has dropped to $2.63 from $2.84. Happy Holidays!!  Look for production cuts starting in December. #gasprice @Old_National
5323 2018-11-19 14:50:30 I don’t wanna pay for a damn oil change 
5324 2018-11-19 14:50:29 my flat mate:

1) is a meat eater
2) is tight with money 
3) shivers when I make veggie stuff

but @ Lidl today he came over to me to ask which sauce to get, said “no wait this one has palm oil in it”

then went & replaced all of his products that had #PalmOil in them #Progress
5325 2018-11-19 14:50:28 So over Saudi Arabia!  They are NOT OUR FRIENDS.  They smile to our faces and stick a knife in our backs.  We can get oil elsewhere!!!!

5332 2018-11-19 14:49:44 I find this in so many establishments that have a TV in the lobby. I was having my oil changed and sat in the lobby dumbfounded by the twisting of facts and then, of course, the complete fabrications. It’s STILL shocking to me.

5337 2018-11-19 14:49:00 It’s not ‘arguing’ that we only have 2. Stats are math, it’s measurable/quantifiable.

I want a winning team, I’d LOVE a winning/playoff team. When the 2018/19 season ends, we’ll have not a lot of points from secondary guys, just like last year. I’d like it to be different.
5338 2018-11-19 14:48:48 A couple of mates of mine have BMWs. Never understood why a top end company put a dark plastic tip, the same colour as used oil, on the end of their dipstick rather thaan a white one, thus making checking the oil level bloody difficult.

5348 2018-11-19 14:47:35    Satisfying: in low-calorie diets, the presence of olive oil is interesting because it relieves the feeling of hunger. In addition, its consumption has been associated with the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates moods. #AOVE #aceitedeoliva #EVOO #o

5350 2018-11-19 14:47:26 Hahaha. Even Advani ji not fit to be cabinet! OK. What has this cabinet of extremely capable leaders, some never won an election, achieved! Aurangazeb taxes of ₹14.50/ litre increased when oil prices fell, but ₹2.50 reduced when oil prices reached $70/ barrel. Is this merit?
5351 2018-11-19 14:47:19 Break out the oil and sacrifice that delicious delicious bird!!!
5352 2018-11-19 14:47:08 i live right near an ALTEX oil car loading facility.  since canadian oil price has plummeted the shipping has increased 3 fold.    They load a train a day and added a 2nd one mile spurr to compliment thier 11 half mile spurs.
5353 2018-11-19 14:47:07 Yeah . . . .my new oil tank is being installed  . . .just in time for the beautiful warmer weather and days we are expecting here in North Carolina
5354 2018-11-19 14:46:51 Só assim o preço justo chegará ao consumidor final!!!

Não enxergo outra maneira, privatiza e desburocratiza o setor para entrada de novos players (fim do cartel). Barril de Oil caiu 23% e gasolina na bomba menos de 4% na média. ISSO TEM QUE ACABAR!

5383 2018-11-19 14:44:24 RHI only incentivised heating hot water with solar and not space heating. Arguably because it's an off grid technology which utility's will struggle to profit from. ALL new builds should be considering solar thermal. Our future generations will look back with astonishment
5384 2018-11-19 14:44:24 Chevron is causing so much destruction across the globe and hopefully they will be held accountable. Big oil does not care who or where they do their dirty deeds. Thank you for speaking out!!

5403 2018-11-19 14:42:36 Japan was forced into a corner. They had designs on expansion into Asia. 
- US set sanctions on oil, gas and steel. 
- Froze Japanese assets in US banks. 
- Moved Pacific Fleet to Pearl Harbour.
US did fight like hell on their own soil and then chased Japan across the globe.

5442 2018-11-19 14:39:43 It's certainly a play with lots of potential, but still tied to the whims of government. It's cheap but in a crowded space of other cheap TSXV/CSE stocks down 75% or more in 2018 and more senior oil plays like CPG also down a lot. All depends where you feel best putting capital.

Then talk about special interest pay-offs from Saudi-Arabia & USA oil sharks to smother  oil, then blame environmental nonsense.
5461 2018-11-19 14:38:11 A rare occasion that I am watching the morning “news” shows while waiting to have the oil changed in my car. People actually watch this shit? On a regular basis? Jesus.

5469 2018-11-19 14:37:31 Ooh I like the idea of sprinkling turmeric on an ex in case of a break up.

Or if you lose your job - then apply fish oil liberally to the employer.
5470 2018-11-19 14:37:23 That’s nothing to be proud of. We should be weaning ourselves off of oil.
5471 2018-11-19 14:37:09 You can include whoever you like but far too many like to use that as some kind of crutch for what has gone on in Edmonton since the change was made. This isn't on the old regime, it's on good ol' Pete and Bobby.

5473 2018-11-19 14:36:55 ...of the increase in global oil demand.  Watch how you say that.  The other 20% might be tougher to find.
5474 2018-11-19 14:36:38 My daughter used to get it a lot. Oil of oregano really helps.  If you can stand the taste 3 drops in a shot glass of water or you can buy capsules to put the drops in.
5475 2018-11-19 14:36:34 I’m a fan of yours and of the Oilers, but if you’re happy with this supporting cast, I’m not sure what to tell you. There’s not a 20 goal scorer in the bunch outside of the top guys. I wish/hope/pray someone steps up but realistically, the team lacks talent (and perhaps coaching)
5476 2018-11-19 14:36:31 I speak from my experience, of course. It may be different for you. I never tried the oil. I’ve went to placebo artists before (Some call them Reiki Healers) and got nothing from it, but I know a lot of crazy ppl that swear by them.
5477 2018-11-19 14:36:26 BNP PARIBAS SAYS EXPECTS BRENT OIL PRICES TO RECOVER TO $80/BBL BEFORE THE YEAR-END and natgas to fall under 4?

5479 2018-11-19 14:36:21 When I washed my face twice a day I had constant breakouts and my skin was super bumpy, now literally all I do is take off my makeup with coconut oil (no moisturizer, toner, or anything) and I get like one pimple a year. Sometimes less is more
5480 2018-11-19 14:36:18 The oil we use is a 90/10 solution of or tears and Quaker State 10w30. It's not coming off.

5490 2018-11-19 14:35:13 Why would citizens have to pay to clean up orphaned oil and gas wells?  Shouldn't the oil and gas industry do that?  Polluter pays?  Step 1 - fix the bankruptcy laws.  Step 2.  Don't approve any new wells until all old ones are cleaned up.

5493 2018-11-19 14:34:56 Describing how Sierra Leone's currency moves about like a yo-yo, this bloke argues that the country doesn't have oil receipts, and thus is denied the "luxury" of throwing reserves at the currency to "peg" it.

He made "luxury" sound like a synonym for madness!

5496 2018-11-19 14:34:39 Home cooking fires peak on Thanksgiving. Don't leave your kitchen unattended while cooking. Keep turkey fryers away from buildings and automobiles and follow suggestions on determining the maximum amount of oil to add BEFORE starting the fryer.

5560 2018-11-19 14:29:31 After you PDP squandered our national resources through corruption, stealing and thieving, and price of crude oil is low, how do you expect Govt to even pay salary to tallness of other infrastructural Dev? Do you want us to continue borrowing just to pay salary like GEJ did in 15

5562 2018-11-19 14:29:20 Hi Elliot, thanks for your concern. We use very small amounts of palm oil in our products, but even so, we’re committed to sourcing fully sustainable and traceable palm oil free from deforestation. Feel free to DM us if you want to know more.
5563 2018-11-19 14:29:19 Do what I did.... Gift everything except screws, springs, plastic and waste to a wanting player (or drop). Tag those items for search, along with lead, oil and ally. Now you can start over and make sure you only have the junk you need.
5564 2018-11-19 14:29:14 Try CBD oil since it has the ability to reduce anxiety, which can be helpful in reducing sleep difficulties and improving sleep quality
5565 2018-11-19 14:29:06 I need coffee.. but thankfully, my skin is all glowy from this brown sugar olive oil scrub ...  I smell good but I have cramps so I'm still aggy lol
5566 2018-11-19 14:28:52 Because they still trade oil in U.S. dollars.
5567 2018-11-19 14:28:45 I hate the illegal palm industry as much as anyone. Still, I bet we’ll eventually find the seed oil industry have put BIG $ into the anti palm oil campaign. Just as big oil supported the anti-smoking cause. (Because, ‘deflection’ is a super effective damage-control strategy )

5569 2018-11-19 14:28:34 What I’m saying is that people on the coasts are not interested in where their food comes from or where their oil is drilled. The smaller, less populated states literally sustain the country with food and energy. Their contributions far exceed their populations.

5577 2018-11-19 14:27:23 We can't upset the scary Saudis to whom we cede full control because we  are so dependent on oil. We need to just keep giving them more weapons so they don't get mad at us. Problem solved. You're welcome.
5578 2018-11-19 14:27:11 Is this emergency service only or is there ability to schedule oil changes and things like that?
5579 2018-11-19 14:26:57 It's similar to the feed in tariff system. But if you look close (as #AI will in the future) both incentives have had too much input from the very industries renewables try to discourage. E.g. utility companies are now collecting free PV which they profit astronomically from.

5640 2018-11-19 14:20:03 No just pointing out the obvious.  People who have that much money could care less about universal health care, and they work for the oil interests.
5641 2018-11-19 14:20:00 Most folks are unaware that palm oil was FAR more prevalent in decades past but was ditched in many products for ‘healthier’  fats from seed oils. The irony is, like lard, palm oil tastes better and is healthier. We need to encourage sustainable palm oil, not ban it altogether.

5643 2018-11-19 14:19:52 The whole thing is confusing. If we don't use palm oil, we will need to use another veg oil that needs more land mass to grow so is effectively worse than palm oil in the long run from what I understand?

I wonder how long it will be before he allows oil rigs off the coast even tho Floridians voted against it.
5649 2018-11-19 14:19:13 Your statement was that oil spilled because companies would not shut down.  False.  Not sure why you went off on the weather tangent after my response. Fairly obvious there was severe weather, but your statement that failure to shut down pre-storm resulted in the spill is false

5685 2018-11-19 14:16:06 Subsidies for companies shouldn’t be a loss net income to tax payers. Subsidizing oil companies almost always gives the government a positive return, often a massive return with royalties. That is not true for ev’s. A fact you are missing here.

5723 2018-11-19 14:12:15 For the same reason you don't like to live in a conflict ridden neighborhood or building. It's on the US best interest to cohabitate with countries that are stable, SPECIALLY if they share a border (Mexico) or if they are and have been one of the US MAIN oil suppliers (Venezuela)
5724 2018-11-19 14:12:13 I went for an oil change, ended up spending $350, and left with a quote for more repairs. Trust me, I know that “ugh” all too well. I see a good pair of running shoes in my future.

5730 2018-11-19 14:11:41 I love the seeds from squash, roasted in a little oil in the oven but don't recall ever eating the skin. This is something I've got to try, as I've every reason to think it will be delicious and it cuts down on waste. Win/win! 
5731 2018-11-19 14:11:35 Without oil we would still be in the dark ages

5733 2018-11-19 14:11:16 @truecrimegarage Hi captain. Big fan. Have you heard of CBD oil? My wife suferers from depression and Anxiety, we only found out about this a few days ago. Hasnt neen around long in England.  She has been taking it for a few days and said it could be life changing for her..
5734 2018-11-19 14:11:01 They don't need to.  Their overpaid contractors and PR shills in DC are fed millions of oil dollars to know what consistency means.
5735 2018-11-19 14:11:01 My Dad was able to tell me how much oil is in this oil tank over video chat in like 10 seconds lol who needs oil??!
5736 2018-11-19 14:10:59 We're having a 2hr protest delay this morning, like the snow delays up in New England.

5737 2018-11-19 14:10:50 I've been saying i want to buy a barrel of crude oil and light it on fire in my backyard for years. Only half joking.

5742 2018-11-19 14:10:24 It is incredible.  I worked 17 hours. I was running all day. Nursing is difficult at times but rewarding.  I am so glad just a few drops of oil can provide me pain relief and easier movement. My stress level is reduced too. Win ,win situation #nurse
5743 2018-11-19 14:10:21 Shocking!!!

All the political looters in this damnable entity called Nigeria are aware that Buhari is dead and Jubril is an imposter from Sudan. But they will not talk least Nigeria divides and thus crumbles their oil and gas thievery.

5759 2018-11-19 14:09:11 I understand there is a lot of work, processing, and license requirements to make CBD oil thus it cost a lot of money to purchase. I get that.

5768 2018-11-19 14:08:30 @NeNeLeakes has your team looked at CBD oil and it’s affects on cancer?
5769 2018-11-19 14:08:25 Lol. Right so when the great drop of oil prices hit less than 30 a barrel out dollar dropped too.      They used to call it the Petro dollar when Canada was once known for being a player in the oil industry. Look at the performance before the oil drop.  Thank you.
5770 2018-11-19 14:08:24 I don't get it. When you're short calls, you want the underlying to drop, which oil has done. How did they lose money?
5771 2018-11-19 14:08:21 I just got an oil change - it was more than what I’m used to, but I guess it costs more for foreign vehicles...?
5772 2018-11-19 14:08:16 Loading up producers now is either really smart or stupid. What's the answer? Think if oil does go lower it will put focus back on mega drills (first one being #RMP) and potentially another producer run when they've pulled back abit
5773 2018-11-19 14:08:14 So if the government is willing to subsidize the oil, auto and aerospace industries without hesitation... maybe they can also throw a bone to the little guys (family owned restaurants, independent convenience and grocery stores, etc.). And maybe properly fund our public schools!

5775 2018-11-19 14:07:57 Yes, you get plate or tubes. But as this page demonstrates all manufacturers followed the RHI and  their solar thermal only heats the hot water when it could be doing so much more.

5779 2018-11-19 14:07:49 Venezuela is failing due to US sanctions designed to cripple the country whilst handing over the biggest oil fields in the world over to capitalists. Plus further US actions (likely CIA organised) to devalue its currency and paint it as a dictatorship.

5781 2018-11-19 14:07:41 The glut is a result of the lack of transportation options for crude oil (ie pipelines). Cutting back on production will lower the surplus stock for a while but won’t fix the pipeline issue.

5804 2018-11-19 14:05:44 I went to get an oil change the other day and paid an extra 10 at Wal-Mart to have them completely clean and flush out the engine. She runs like new. Quit as cat feet.
5805 2018-11-19 14:05:38 A few days ago you were calling for govt intervention to fix the oil glut. In fact, it was govt intervention, in the form of Trudeau’s incompetent & confused pipeline policy, which created the glut in the 1st place. More govt isn’t the solution now.

5823 2018-11-19 14:03:18 Not sure I agree. Presidents have always cut the Saudis too much slack — especially after 9/11 — due to our foolish dependence on oil.
5824 2018-11-19 14:03:17 OPEC has lost what control of the oil market it ever had. The actions of three men —  Trump and Putin and  Bin Salman — will determine the course of oil prices in 2019 and beyond. Together they produce more oil than the 15 members of OPEC

5848 2018-11-19 14:00:40 Puls this person cares about oil and money more than the truth. As long you pay, you can do what ever you want and there's no consequences
5849 2018-11-19 14:00:37 Oil? What oil? Revenue is only expected to be £0.9bn for 2018-19, it's too difficult to extract. You need to wise up, and do some research.

5856 2018-11-19 13:59:50 But those nations are THRILLED to export their poverty to the USA for us to support.

Mexico has ENCOURAGED their poor to leave and go to the US.

Mexico's 2nd largest income behind oil is REMITTANCE....from those working in the USA.

We need a wall with border guards, period.

5858 2018-11-19 13:59:46 Iran and Venezuela have sanctions imposed for a variety of reasons. Iran can go to hell, and Venezuela treats its people like garbage. We've upped our own oil production to keep prices low, if what you say is true, we'd never have done that.

5862 2018-11-19 13:59:33 It is not so. The article by MONGABAY references many RSPO failures and no signs of changing or improving anything any time soon by those involved. Palm Oil production is unsustainable. Check food/product labels.

A murderous dictatorship desguised as sheep and we don't mind because we need their dirty oil. Realistically we love that sunni/shia warfare, we can sell them our mighty "democratic" weapons.

6127 2018-11-19 13:31:30 He was never taught empathy and probably misses basic education on how money cannot buy everything.  He should be made to eat his black oil and paper monetary till he realises that every human being is equal.

6151 2018-11-19 13:28:30 In my lifetime we have built a tunnel under the English Channel and other nations have completed epic level projects. Yet strangely no major infrastructure in Africa.  No Trans African water pipeline, plenty of oil and gas though.
Charities have wasted billions and barely helped.

6153 2018-11-19 13:28:09 Rupee rose against US Dollar as big private banks sold dollars heavily noting easing in crude oil prices. Weakening of Dollar index kept the sentiment higher. However, Dollar demand from importers capped further gains. The Rupee ended at 71.66 vs. previous close of 71.92.
6154 2018-11-19 13:28:08 Yes, like olive oil and garlic 
6155 2018-11-19 13:27:59 I'd rather give up Palm Oil if if helped the planet, too much rainforest is being cut down for this product, due to it being a much cheaper oil to use by manufacturers. If the trees are gone, not only the lungs of the world are, but bees & pollinators plus species die off!
6156 2018-11-19 13:27:58 You know they are missing a trick
 Stop planting more palm oil
And make the price of existing
 Palm oil rise. Make more Profit

6165 2018-11-19 13:26:58 @LindaFoods why are you not using sustainable palm oil?
6166 2018-11-19 13:26:47 Here are some of the health benefits of olive oil.

 Olive Oil Contains Large Amounts of Antioxidants
 Olive Oil Has Strong Anti-Inflammatory Properties

6170 2018-11-19 13:26:19 I'd say if you're legitimately trying to grow a beard, give it at least 8 weeks of growth before you do anything major. Also, invest in some decent beard oil to deal with itching if you have any

My beard doesn't even look passable until I've let it grow for about 3 months
6171 2018-11-19 13:26:16 1|Oil 2018
The journey to 2023 is starting from a relatively comfortable place. An overhang in global oil stocks has all but disappeared and oil prices have recovered. The oil price rally has rewarded those taking part in output cuts and has also unleashed a new wave of growth

250 000 L crude oil spill.

6188 2018-11-19 13:25:13 Agreed. If the taxes and oil and coal exports were used to make a cheap safe nuclear reactor for export everyone would benefit.

This is my guess though. What did she say?

6225 2018-11-19 13:22:09 OPEC are cutting supply. I think North America will soon realise it is decades behind in the business of selling oil.
6226 2018-11-19 13:22:03 Because of American dependence on foreign and especially Saudi oil and billion $ arms deals, nothing will come of this.

6228 2018-11-19 13:21:52 @DrBirute I still remember seeing footage of an orangutan being killed by dogs purposely set on by palm oil workers. I suspect this wasn’t a one off incident, especially since no charges were laid due to fear of workers testifying.
6229 2018-11-19 13:21:39 So @TireDiscounters in Harrison, Oh is refusing to do oil changes Fri/Sat.  Guess who just not only my oil change business but also my tire buys business going forward as well!
6230 2018-11-19 13:21:36 Rightly so then. Casing point, they operate most of the oil refineries in S. Sudan but they neither have a peace keeping force there nor have they been implicated in financing rebels. They are here for business & not occupation. Unlike our beloved "democratic" West...

6284 2018-11-19 13:16:00 Hi! The Body Shop is committed to sourcing sustainable palm oil. If we include palm oil in our products we purchase only RSPO certified palm oil. - Jolene
6285 2018-11-19 13:15:59 I'll go higher than that - I mean think about all the sector funds out there - why would an oil or biotech guy be in those?

so let's call it a dozen
6286 2018-11-19 13:15:58 We are all ok  luckily I didn't drive too fast because of the road works but heavy rain and patrol oil or whatever oil on the road made it so slippery. So.... That was happened

6288 2018-11-19 13:15:44 Has there ever been a better reason to ditch oil as an energy source than the fact it is controlled entirely by these three assholes?
6289 2018-11-19 13:15:41 True. The transport links was meant to join cities in Kenya, Ethiopia and South Sudan that would in turn boost trade for these regional countries. Revitalization of this project will give us a breathing space with Sudan who is on our neck because of their oil pipeline.

6295 2018-11-19 13:15:12 My kids like the smell of oil. Say it smells like Chanukah to them! I cook in oil for all 8 nights. First and last we have latkes.
6296 2018-11-19 13:15:05 In case there needed to be another reason to end the stranglehold that oil has on us.
6297 2018-11-19 13:15:02 P2 I'm sure you understand that having a strong moral compass can be conflicting at times. While our synthetics which contain palm oil are guaranteed to not be tested on animals, contain no animal derivatives.
6298 2018-11-19 13:15:01 This paragraph is of interest - 'Mineral fuels including oil was the fastest-growing export product among the top 10 categories, up 38.4% from 2016 to 2017 led by increased international sales revenue for UK’s crude oil, refined petroleum oils and petroleum gases'
6299 2018-11-19 13:14:59 今日は早めに終わったーーー！！！
6300 2018-11-19 13:14:40 P1: Hi. Thanks so much for getting in touch. Although we no longer use palm oil in our products, some of our safe synthetics contain palm oil derivatives, simply because it’s so hard to find a suitable alternative.

Tastes amazing too!
6306 2018-11-19 13:13:54 By putting in climate deniers for the oil industry worldwide.  It is nearly too late already.
6307 2018-11-19 13:13:49 Agreed, I think they both matter mrtp.  Combine RE/contruction and oil and check out the % of GDP in Canada.  Scary

6345 2018-11-19 13:09:25 Palm oil supply chains are complex & hard to make sustainable (altho v important to try).

6384 2018-11-19 13:03:45 I will not be buying anymore of your products until you ditch your disgraceful practice of using palm oil.
6385 2018-11-19 13:03:28 Perhaps because they are not aware of oil in that direction?
Perhaps because people in the US are getting rich off of the drug trade and treatment trade?
Perhaps because we are idiots and let our government run amuck with sociopathic politicians?

6396 2018-11-19 13:02:18 The thing is, even if we get fusion right, it will not remove our need for oil as an extremely liquid/versatile (easy to transport, to transform, and to use) energy source, I do not believe at all that any energy source can be as useful as oil.

6399 2018-11-19 13:01:56 Hi @IanMiddletonX trust you're well! The sheer hypocrisy of them is breath-taking. I asked them what they use instead of palm oil - the reply, rapeseed - which is more destructive to the environment.

6412 2018-11-19 13:01:20 Buy crude oil 56.85
6413 2018-11-19 13:01:16 dunno if any of yous are into the extraordinary oil spray, but it's £9.99 for 1 or 3 for £10 in boots atm
6414 2018-11-19 13:01:06 今頑張って肉じゃがの芋と格闘してんだけどだいぶ腹キツい
6415 2018-11-19 13:00:45 Broken my heart to find out that Freddo biscuits have palm oil in them but now I refuse to buy them
6416 2018-11-19 13:00:37 A Libyan municipality producing water, gas and oil announces the emigration of 200 of its families due to poor living! 

Yeah - Did "God" #Sanalla ever address this?
6417 2018-11-19 13:00:34 It might interest you to note that the most revolutionary bill that has ever been produced for the reform of the Nigerian oil sector was rejected by Baba.

The Petroleum Industry Governance Bill.

Why? 

Bcos Baba didn't want to give up his power to award licenses.

6419 2018-11-19 13:00:32 Bravo!
 Looks beautiful & artificial .  That is, it looks like a combination of oil & water colored painting. The trees looks real, it's that mini bridge that looks fake.  BTW ~ all the leaves are on the ground but now. 
6420 2018-11-19 13:00:28 It's all about oil money...

6423 2018-11-19 13:00:18 Yes. And after that peak, prices were driven down by a series of increases in Stamp Duty for higher value prime properties, overseas purchasers and investors, none of which had anything to do with oil prices. Brexit uncertainty did nothing to help, from June 16 for anyone.
6424 2018-11-19 13:00:15 Growing the GDP by 6% between 1999-2007 is an achievement yet to be marched by the current admin.
Before you reference oil prices, may I remind you that, it was much lower then than now.
6425 2018-11-19 13:00:06 There is a company in Kenya that produces that avocado oil, Can't remember the name though. It's very pricey.
6426 2018-11-19 12:59:45 كاتبها صحيح يا سعيد.
6427 2018-11-19 12:59:18 None of the above. Its because they are so kind hearted and we are so poor. They want to take the burden of all that nasty oil stuff of our shoulder
6428 2018-11-19 12:59:11 Oil marketers decry subsidy debt payment’s delay
6429 2018-11-19 12:58:55 Steph was burning the midnight oil again last night - our Quick service 'what we ate in Disney' video will be up tonight at 18:00 #foodporn #DisneyWorld 
6430 2018-11-19 12:58:53 Eh tersuka dengan marula oil
6431 2018-11-19 12:58:38 Saving the habitats of these great creatures just for oil, we can use rapeseed oil instead of palm oil for food and we will save animals.
6432 2018-11-19 12:58:13 Yes very important to keep those weapons sales and oil deals.
So much more important than stopping the atrocities or saving the planet
6433 2018-11-19 12:58:09 "I don't think people who are taking money from pharmaceutical companies should be drafting health care legislation.

6436 2018-11-19 12:57:50 I see Yarima and Abdulfatah , so ya all in Lagos
6437 2018-11-19 12:57:47 I bet it’s much cheaper in France, and they’re rioting because of a hike. Guess which country is an oil producer?
6438 2018-11-19 12:57:47 The issue isn't about incentive to pay when CIT rate is reduced. A number of Nigerian taxpayers are hell bent on circumventing the system. Tax amnesty has been on for months, they didn't take the opportunity. What does that tell you? I think he's a confused man. Tax cut, no 2 oil
6439 2018-11-19 12:57:44 もう寝ていいか？徹夜はきびぃって流石に
6440 2018-11-19 12:57:37 I love robotic oil poffins~!
6441 2018-11-19 12:57:32 I would put about 1/4 inch of water in pan.  Bake on 325 for about 20 min.  You could seer it on all sides frost in butter ( I am southern you know) or any healthy oil.

6443 2018-11-19 12:57:25 The divestment of @NNPCgroup and our oil and gas infrastructure is the way to go. And only @atiku has the political will to get it done. Vote for PDP.
6444 2018-11-19 12:57:05 Midnight oil...beds are burning!
6445 2018-11-19 12:57:04 I would like you to spell it, b/c I'm not sure I get it. If a energy source is order of magnitude more efficient that what you would get from oil, what the point to complexify for less efficient energy production chain?
6446 2018-11-19 12:56:58 Too obsessed with oil etc to make a big change to the country; but hey, let’s start another war over it
6447 2018-11-19 12:56:56 Day off bukas para lang sa change oil ng motor ko haha.
6448 2018-11-19 12:56:53 Jadi pengen nonton konsernya blackpink
6449 2018-11-19 12:56:44 This government diverted our attentions from the oil sector so as to give them space to steal and loot the country's money....
6450 2018-11-19 12:56:41 When you don't understand the discussion or have your facts right, just step aside and let sensible people comment... you guys will never grow up, always thinking in a reverse direction. Who told you crude oil sold at the highest price during OBJ/Atiku govt.?
6451 2018-11-19 12:56:40 oil trminal in uk we will be late leaving line up might as well go load it will be a light 1 we have to unload plates and beams at york then a trip to france we need more military equipment looking for osh kosh and 6x6 calling my prince as well
6452 2018-11-19 12:56:37 It will be another year before it kicks in properly - for now just get out there and buy some from your local dealer - and the CBD oil lis legal now - if you know where to get it.
6453 2018-11-19 12:56:34 The fishery is a billion dollar industry that’s slowly dwindling we don’t need oil spills pushing it faster
6454 2018-11-19 12:56:30 Oil based nga pabango mo eh hahaha.
6455 2018-11-19 12:56:14 tangaha kay nako oyyy. imbis ang tuyo nga paliton kay baby oil ang napalit baby cologne. gosh! basa-basa pud lagi panalagsa self oyyy
6456 2018-11-19 12:56:03 Mr. President, I'm concerned for the earth if we keep drawing the oil out of it. Lubrication is necessary when rock rubs against rock. Earth quakes can result from the friction. Please evaluate when making choices. Thank you.
6457 2018-11-19 12:56:00 Worldwide this is changing except US and Canada because we own these resources and need something to profit with. Judging by gas and oil prices lately, it’s a bad investimebt and all around choice. We’ll eventually learns it’s best to get ahead of things rather than chase them.
6458 2018-11-19 12:55:53 Come on’ man, can you imagine what tRump’s billionaire puppeteers would do if he did not show being down on his knees?

6463 2018-11-19 12:55:30 Where did you get that theory from?
UK, Russia , China and  every other major oil producing country have there own oil producing company.
selling it is never there discussion.
Nigeria is not better than China when it comes to business
6464 2018-11-19 12:55:25 So now that the Iceland commercial exposing the palm oil industry has been shared 100 million times and everyone feels like they’ve “done their part”, how many of you have ACTUALLY put the effort in to reduce your palm oil consumption? Sharing an article doesn’t fix the issue 
6465 2018-11-19 12:55:11 pakai la cleansing oil, suitable for combination & oily skin

6472 2018-11-19 12:54:45 Since 2015, what have we gained from the oil sector. The government said we should forget about oil and go to the farm.
6473 2018-11-19 12:54:39 「行ってきて」と言われないだけ奥さんやさしい^^
6474 2018-11-19 12:54:37 Cutting and increasing are depending on the price of Oil 
There’s target price if the price of oil lower than target they will cut and if it’s higher than target they will increase

6482 2018-11-19 12:53:55 I’d have done the same. Maaaaaaybe a coconut oil swap, but maybe not; the lean quality is so nice with fruit.
6483 2018-11-19 12:53:54 Nope but it still should a big concern and be shoving at gov an big oil endlessly
6484 2018-11-19 12:53:54 No b'y lol, I just don't think any union can do much with a government that has blinders on when it comes to oil. Look at Alberta and the oil sands for example
6485 2018-11-19 12:53:53 Mtcheww Na dem send you na....... When no be say blanket no dey.... We go do under blanket... Na you go suffer dey hear ring tone Las Las I go give you Goya or olive oil make you go do your own for bathroom. 
6486 2018-11-19 12:53:47 If Nigeria was that strong as at may 2015, a drop it oil price won't lead to recession. Within these 3 years, efforts have been made to diversify. These people that were in charge  before 2015, uninterrupted for 16 years couldn't do it, and are now coming back to preach to us.

6495 2018-11-19 12:52:23 At the dealership for an oil change and the guy let’s me know that there’s a recall on my engine. Thanks for the notice.
6496 2018-11-19 12:52:20 Ohh @jack , you are thoroughly misused by the pompous show bands of this land. Dont fall for it. They shut off the lamp & show you only darkness around, bcaz that suits their agenda better. They are fighting this since centuries to fail again. Light up a lamp b4 oil gets empty !!

6498 2018-11-19 12:52:19 No longer a car company but a transportation company. Just like the oil companies will have to become energy companies if they want to survive the end of oil.
6499 2018-11-19 12:52:18 この２人はモノホンです
6500 2018-11-19 12:52:17 A release and some tweets are about the extent of what they can do. This province is going for the oil no matter what, I think. No union is going to stop them.
6501 2018-11-19 12:52:16 โคตรแกร่งอ่ะ
6502 2018-11-19 12:51:41 Mr. President, If we keep drawing oil out of the earth, there won't be any lubrication for rock rubbing against each other. Consequently, there will be even more earth quakes than we see now. What if we sucked  the oil out of our bodies? It wouldn't take long for us to dry up.

Here at Fortnum & Mason, we obtain our palm oil from a sustainable source.

However we will be removing it from all of our products in the future, regardless of sustainability.

Kind regards

Jamie @ Fortnum & Mason

6562 2018-11-19 12:44:55 Hi Sarah, The small amount of palm oil used in our chargrills is sustainably sourced. We commit to only using palm oil sourced under the RSPO (Round Table Sustainable Sourcing of Palm Oil) rules, chain of custody requirements and certification. Kind regards, Birds Eye UK

Have we lost this one as a consequence of the war?

6578 2018-11-19 12:43:16 Exactly. RHI only incentivised solar thermal for providing hot water when it can also contribute massively to space heating demand. How big a clue does the sun have to be in this wonderful "solar" system of ours. So much emphasis on photo voltaic (PV) solar thermal gets drowned

6643 2018-11-19 12:34:58 For example, the Nigerian govt has expended in excess of $5b looking for oil in certain frontiers of our dear country.

Russian Energy Min Alexander Novak said that Russia will sign a partnership deal with OPEC details would be discussed in Vienna on December 6.

If you read the green new deal, you would get she’s talking about investing in infrastructure and policies related to renewable energy. The US is lagging behind, and for some reason subsidizing oil companies.

6728 2018-11-19 12:25:21 I clearly agree that those sites are of high conservation value; what we criticize is the shortcut used to protect them, lowering the quality of the protection (as seen by the recent oil and gas leases announced in those areas)...

6730 2018-11-19 12:25:11 Wasn't really thinking of corruption when I said they managed their oil industry well. It's more about how they made it more efficient, productive, profitable and impactful on the rest of their economy

A local glut is an inconvenience, but it’s not economic collapse. The producers still hold an asset that doesn’t spoil: petroleum. In time the price will rise again. Now is a good time to buy.

6812 2018-11-19 12:14:57 Hi Julie, While we use palm oil as a responsible producer we only use RSPO certified sustainable palm oil.
6813 2018-11-19 12:14:28 And ugliest in the world. The arrogance of the oil/gas companies in full display. To ruin the skyline of one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Just disgusting
6814 2018-11-19 12:14:01 This means that we only source palm oil from certified growers and we buy the sustainable palm oil at a premium, which allows the producer to reinvest and help tackle the environmental and social issues surrounding the palm oil industry. 2/3

6835 2018-11-19 12:11:47 We have already unleashed centuries of carbon and recently huge methane pulses. No Geoengineering is in sight. Governments are in the pocket of oil. Even if we start today the issues of scale mean large time lags for any impact on carbon levels and the rest.
6836 2018-11-19 12:11:30 From what i can see, the only person who could save Arepyong now is the cashier herself.

6841 2018-11-19 12:11:02 A better question is why we have a relationship with them at all. They threw LGBT people from rooves, whip women for being raped, and behead 'non-believers'.

Oh, right, oil. They have oil, so we have to be nice to them.

6859 2018-11-19 12:09:49 @metromorning The Can. Oil & Gas sector account for about 2% of total Canadian GDP. And about 8% if associated economic activity is included. The Oil Industry and Alberta & Federal govt. over represent its importance. (source: CanFacts and National Observer, Google )

6868 2018-11-19 12:08:12 So you are compairing an award winning investigative journalist, who works with two national newspapers, with a fat Texas snake oil salesman. Cognitive dissonance runs deep here
6869 2018-11-19 12:08:03 Which is why we want to stay in EU as a partner not subservient. To be told we're an equal partner but then told no when asking for a sectn 30. Besides, I don't agree it would be us.  We'd have all the oil as well as the basics.  I think all our world class products we'd do fine

6871 2018-11-19 12:07:40 casus fortuitus..
same play Arabs use to subsidise their airlines, they can afford to do that due to cheap fuel and profits from the oil fields..
6872 2018-11-19 12:07:38 It's about money but it's nuanced:
1. 2007/8 Financial Crisis left countries selling arms to #SaudiArabia broke so they're desperate not to lose this income stream no matter how many die.
2. Russia and the US depend on oil income too so they can't pressure Gulf states too much.
6873 2018-11-19 12:07:31 Totally agree that this is the problem, but I think the point is that the solution isn’t boycotting palm oil in favour of other oils. Reduce use overall (less processed goods), and source responsibly where oil is needed.

He started it by forcing Akpabio to join the All Progressive Criminals —APC and deliver the oil rich state to their insatiable taste for corruption and wasting of lives
6878 2018-11-19 12:07:02 Very well said and precisely correct. My country's concept of "market balance" is to let everyone else do the balancing, while we go wide-ass open to deplete the last of our oil resources and rack up hundreds of billions of dollars of debt. We'll pay for that someday, dearly.

6880 2018-11-19 12:06:46   Meanwhile I just found 2 big jars of coconut oil from Trader Joe's but they allegedly "expired" in 2017. Thought of you immediately  because now I know how you felt about that sunscreen. Can coconut oil expire? Because they're still sealed...

6967 2018-11-19 11:54:13 Specious nonsense. That wasn't the point and you know it. If you werea real eco warrior, or even had any sense you would aknowledge that the world turns on oil. You use enough of it. Any electronics at home? Made of scrap wood and rabbit shit? Was the ferry oar powered?

6969 2018-11-19 11:53:37 More costly and thus more polluting too I suppose, like current oil and gas extraction techs from fracking or tar sands.
Also, what do you do with existing power plants? No one knows how to dismantle them, their materials will stay radioactive for centuries...
6970 2018-11-19 11:53:36 叔母（母の妹）に「アンタしばらく１人暮らしだったら、なんでその間ネーさん（母）と一緒に暮らそうとしないの？」って言われたんだけど、そんなのほっといてくれって話よね。１人暮らしは１人暮らしだけど旦那が買った家に母親と２人で住んで当然って思うほど厚かましい人間じゃないわ。
6971 2018-11-19 11:53:20 1/2 Hi Lettie & Mac, we are fully committed to the responsible sourcing of palm oil in our supply chain and NESTLE is looking to achieve 100% responsibly-sourced, no deforestation palm oil by 2020
6972 2018-11-19 11:53:08 As long as the media forgets to remind Trump's base, they won't have to address the issue

Oil billionaires own every part of the economy

It's going to be up to the rest of us to do the heavy lifting

6974 2018-11-19 11:53:01 Partially because energy induced depression is a thing and Putin & Salman are mandated to make sure that the oil revenue generated is enough to pay their minions (while Donald is just a contract breaking cannon fodder).
6975 2018-11-19 11:52:57 @Oreo Oreo continue to buy palm oil from Wilmar - the dirtiest palm oil giant in the world
If Oreo stop buying palm oil from rainforest destroyers like Wilmar the makers of products like Colgate toothpaste/Kit Kat will feel the pressure and the industries will be forced to change
6976 2018-11-19 11:52:42 I put olive oil in a spray bottle and put it on when I was still wet out of the shower
6977 2018-11-19 11:52:41 problem is the EU is heading for a taper on oil use from 2035 , which makes it perhaps doubly important that Scotland sees the income while independent during that very short window.
6978 2018-11-19 11:52:39 Better still, don’t eat Oreos and any processed foods at all! Palm oil contains high levels of saturated fats and raises blood cholesterol levels which is a risk factor for heart disease!

6980 2018-11-19 11:52:27 (2/3) Having explored all viable alternatives, we use a minimal amount of 100% fully segregated / fully sustainable RSPO-certified palm oil in our pie lids (less than 2% of the product). As Greenpeace agrees, to boycott palm oil will only displace the issue...

7052 2018-11-19 11:42:18 That may be true, but my take on this is that palm oil is still used, and in the case of products with high volume sales, that also means it's a lot palm oil... so why not replace the ingredient for something else?

7245 2018-11-19 11:17:31 @oreo I just found out you guys are some of the biggest culprits of rainforests destroyed for Palm Oil, some areas as big as Paris, so they can supply you with Palm Oil
7246 2018-11-19 11:17:17 Monday! And a short week! Asian markets closed mixed, European trading is mixed, futures are down & crude oil is up. Have a great day!
7247 2018-11-19 11:17:08 its not right time to offer, there are many things require to be done before drilling natural Gas or Oil. This step could intensify the insecurity, inequality, corruption and social conflicts. at this tome, its liability & new burden to Somalia

7252 2018-11-19 11:16:38 How so? I'm concerned about Australia's food security given our lack of a decent fuel stockpile (three weeks at best) and rapidly declining oil fields (plus the carbon emissions). We need to take some serious action to derisk our food security.

7256 2018-11-19 11:16:19 Oil breathing issues, and weak filter housings is one area. The other is cracked cylinder liners. Avoid remapped cars. Our S-Max has that engine, though, and so far no issues at 120k miles. Probably gets driven lighter than your average ST! Fabulous engine to drive though.
7257 2018-11-19 11:16:18 However, the Oil & Gas sector recorded the highest decrease among NSE indices with the NSE Oil/Gas index down by 1.13% WTD, owing to significant price depreciation in ETERNA (-17.43%) and SEPLAT (-2.36%). #Anchoriam @proshare @StockmanNigeria

7276 2018-11-19 11:12:31 Now that I have some inkling of understanding of the situation I kinda think sucking Saudi Arabia and other places that are not us dry of oil so we can keep our own in reserve is a good idea and should continue, as bad as many of these places are  short-term vs long-term people

7330 2018-11-19 11:05:19 The slump in oil price is the reason this government cannot make any reasonable Mark in agriculture? The same reason they can't create jobs for millions of Nigerians?

7331 2018-11-19 11:05:18 We are saying the same thing. If you discount some achievement as organic, then discount some problems as organic. Cos Nigeria in recession in 2016 was due to lower crude oil and militant attack, nothing done by the govt.

7377 2018-11-19 10:57:16 As a cancer patient, I occasionally have to put up with people DMing or @-ing me with quack solutions and snake oil. The ignorance on their part is incredibly frustrating - I wish scientific literacy was valued more in our education system. Sorry you have to deal w/ that, Asher.
7378 2018-11-19 10:57:13 Is that dec applying the sun oil on you
7379 2018-11-19 10:57:12 I'm very concerned to see this and we'd like to check the oil pourer. Please return this to your local shop where one of our Partners can examine it ~ thanks Tricia
7380 2018-11-19 10:57:00 Stopping arm deal!! Well,There is always an alternative Mr.Paul and it is better to mind your own business and solve your state problems.If sanctions imposed,oil will be sold in other currency and not w/ u.s dollar. Keep in mind what reaction to action can be before acting stupid

7394 2018-11-19 10:53:23 The UK has had a structural balance of payments problem at least since the 1880s. That was offset 1) by imperial profits, 2) by North Sea oil and 3) by trade within the EEC/EC/EU. 1) has gone, 2) was splurged on Thatcherism and 3) is going.

7401 2018-11-19 10:51:44 but you do know that devaluation was a issue of urgency, requiring immediate action. The reality of Nigeria's low export level is already being addressed, albeit the goods being produced and exported do not meet up with the competitiveness of our oil
7402 2018-11-19 10:51:35 On the MOT advisory it was a ‘slight oil leak’ apparently fuckin not  whole things got to be changed or something
7403 2018-11-19 10:51:28 Yes, a disaster ! Even the most famous french chefs at the tv shows recommend to replace olive oil with sunflower oil to cook or fry. Beef tallow to fry french fries? Oh my gosh, an animal fat, never ! They are loosing their soul, Auguste Escoffier is rolling over in his grave !

7408 2018-11-19 10:50:25 In 2017 import of crude oil  (barrels/day)of France & India was :
India :    4,341,500 
France:  1,140,700 
  
Any relaxation on petrol price in India would’ve caused more consumption pushing import figure. Much bigger impact for India.

7414 2018-11-19 10:49:20 it's not at all about oil prices...it's about everything  taxes, immigration, unemployment, everything is wrong ... oil prices was just the trigger of a deep deep crisis and anger

7448 2018-11-19 10:43:43 We ensure the palm oil we buy is produced on legally held land, does not lead to deforestation or loss of peat land, respects human rights and does not use forced or child labor.

7489 2018-11-19 10:37:35 Zionism is as old as Judaism. It’s relevant because Jews didn’t go to Israel - full of malaria swamps, no natural resources- to take over oil or mines or to subjugate. We went there because we’ve been killed and persecuted everywhere due to not being “from” where we resided

7513 2018-11-19 10:33:19 UK/Oklahoma? We’re no longer trading with countries but with regions/States of countries? Next you’ll be saying you’ve made trade deals with Rogaland about oil, instead of Norway. “Send in the clowns. Don’t bother, they’re here” (This is by Stephen Sondheim by the way)

7520 2018-11-19 10:32:01 @BBCNews The biased censors in the UK see no distinction between a UKIP party political broadcast & a cartoon drawing consumers' attention to murder, rape, environmental destruction & species loss caused by palm oil producers.

The @churchofireland had the same policy as @NationalTrust of excluding coal and oil sands, but engagement and investment in oil and gas.

7653 2018-11-19 10:10:54 What would Man City win without their oil money?
7654 2018-11-19 10:10:52 I'M SO JEALOUS. I've doused my fake one in so much pine oil that I'm a little nervous about turning on the lights.
7655 2018-11-19 10:10:34 Because they just extracted the oil from the nuts. And they did this without drying/roasting the cocoa first. Cocoas are not originally brown. The seeds are white. Then they are dried and roasted like coffee. Boom! They become the cocoa/chocolate you know.
7656 2018-11-19 10:10:26 I’m glad everyone is learning about palm oil but dairy is doing the same on a far larger scale (causing deforestation and taking baby cows away from their mums) and everyone chooses to ignore it :) :)
7657 2018-11-19 10:10:24 髪がさーサラサラしてるのちょっと気にしてんだよなー
7658 2018-11-19 10:10:23 I wouldn’t be surpriswd of the oil companies paid for the development and keeping it under wraps until the reserves are depleted in order to maximise profits?

It can’t clean itself while we dump more on her than she can handle?

7661 2018-11-19 10:10:09 AB oil is some of the heaviest carbon producing oil in available in the world today. That's why no one wants to buy it. It's all about conscience purchasing. There's nothing that #abpoli could say to change that. Shut down the oil sands projects and find a better industry..
7662 2018-11-19 10:10:03 Na chairman for lies ai
7663 2018-11-19 10:09:58 Absolutely. Current fuel price was set with oil at not higher than $35/bbl. I believe kachukwu was ready to allow the price float but his party thought otherwise. Subsidy is subject to huge fraud so we're back to square 1. We need to tell Nigerians the truth and free the market

Perhaps I should be more careful with old food.

7670 2018-11-19 10:07:20 But that doesn't include oil does it? And isn't one of the arguments for independence that Scotland would get to keep all that to itself and would be wealthier at the expense of England. Other (considerable) differences aside, that's not very different from LN's proposition
7671 2018-11-19 10:07:17 Oga, this is a typed document, you said they promised to stabilized global oil price at 100 dollars per barrel. How is that true man? Tell us the ones you added, so that we will know how gullible and fraudulent you are.
7672 2018-11-19 10:07:13 Why would ruk not trade with Scotland? Seems bizarre not to want food, water, oil etc from your nearest neighbour.

If so, proves MBL can't defend themselves and also shows who has the 'high fiinanced' campaign. #NoKrlpDredge @FerretScot

India being non aligned doesn't have much of an option but the economy itself & maybe a few strategic issues.

7851 2018-11-19 09:40:14 Maybe. But Scotland is richer than some parts of England, and it is possibly those parts that would poll the best. Also, it's often claimed they *do* have the money in oil. There are no regional GDP figures though, so the claim about who has the money is moot

7871 2018-11-19 09:37:33 Totally agree, some serious response is needed. Stop selling weapons and have sanctions at state level. Then you must face oil crisis in the best ways. I'd threaten them of retaliation if they start oil war.

Those exports and the related inventory shifts for both quarters, plus, an increase in govt spending explain over 3/4 of Q3.

7942 2018-11-19 09:26:23 @sainsburys Hi, I notice that your own brand Egg Custard tarts have Palm oil and Palm kernel oil listed in the ingredients? Isn't it about time you stopped using the habitat of poor little orangutans in your food ?

7944 2018-11-19 09:26:08 Credit must be given for the Vegan range and their moves towards being palm oil free in their own brand products. Larger food retailers are doing nothing. Incidentally their vegan no bull burger outsold their wagyu. Remain hopeful

7947 2018-11-19 09:25:12 That’s just not right. Fuel here isn’t keeping up with the drop or where it was last time it was this low. Think when oil was this low last time we were paying like $1.65 a gal for gas and diesel. Now it’s still 2.79 here but the average is still well over $3. Gas is 1.99
7948 2018-11-19 09:25:11 I'm sorry but common sense needs to prevail, adults need to put out sensible things.  Do you know how long it takes to build a refinery? Do you know the factors that affect the global oil prices? Do you know how much it takes to generate 1,000MW of electricity?

7972 2018-11-19 09:21:03 The bread making process in the UK requires a small amount of solid fat to be present in the recipe, and to avoid animal fats and hydrogenated oils, we use a small amount of sustainable palm oil. Thank you for your comments regarding the use of palm oil in our products.
7973 2018-11-19 09:20:19 We won’t be stopping oil exploration because of electric cars. Where do you get the jet fuel etc from. EV’s sound like a good sell to the consumer but the reality is they merely shift the source of the pollution to other areas....Fact.

7977 2018-11-19 09:19:30 I'm just reminded that whereas higher global crude oil prices may be revenue postive for Nigeria, the net outcome for emerging markets as a whole is negative.
7978 2018-11-19 09:19:26 Oil revenues typically account for more than two-thirds of government income. Collapsing prices and falling production meant the government operated on about one-quarter of the $5bn in monthly revenues it had before the price fall began in mid-2014.#Perspective

We've asked our producer about a viable alternative ingredient, but if we don't find an alternative, we will stop selling our Sosmix, since we are working towards completely eradicating palm oil from our range.

If you come to the place + see how it is now + you hear about that place in the future, you'd have a stronger connection to know what to do when it comes to palm oil + deforestation.

8142 2018-11-19 08:55:56 @ANCALERTS @ABSCBNNews @MayorDigong This is still BS, price should have been below 38 pesos per liter of Gasoline and 30 for Diesel. World OIL below $60 per barrel.

8167 2018-11-19 08:51:40 Many commentators argue South African Reserve Bank's MPC is going to raise interest rates this week due to inflation rising. I don't agree due to Brent Crude oil price softening and rand gaining strength against the dollar which will in the near future lower inflation.

0.8% (2017), 2.1% (2018). 2016 Nigeria is in recession(lowest GDP  -1.6%) bcos PDP didn't save for the rainy days, despite high oil revenue in the history of Nigeria

8188 2018-11-19 08:48:02 Looks like it. Never thought of it before, but if you damage an oil tanker en route there's really no way to unload except at a proper oil terminal, and only after that you can go to get repairs.

There's the burden of oil too though. Price is down, there's no more supply so we'll crumble as a small nation right? Like every other nation that's gone independent without oil?

8196 2018-11-19 08:46:54 I do a few things that sometimes help when my meds don't. First, heating pad on the back of my neck, warm water cloth on my forehead.  I also use 3 drops of Frankincense essential oil under my tongue which typically will take the edge off.  Hope you find relief soon

8199 2018-11-19 08:46:46 Some of the alternatives to sustainable palm oil are much worse on the environment. Because of your campaign I’m seeing people advocating buying from companies that don’t use palm oil but are horrendous for their record of animal testing.

We are on track to ensure that 100% of palm oil for our own brand non-food products is sourced from RSPO certified sources by the end of 2018. Thanks
8290 2018-11-19 08:27:21 Lmao. I've not confirmed this but I am inclined to accept it as fact. 

Hazard does one season on, one season off like an oil rig worker. He has a fantastic season, then goes on maternity leave. It makes sense that he's turned up for 3 out of 6 years.

8303 2018-11-19 08:24:50 Agree. It’s jusr interesting we do this framing with some products but not others.  We don’t have $150 maple syrup and 50SKU’s or with meats or vinegar or water.  we do only with olive oil and wine and spirits.

8403 2018-11-19 08:03:49 Even if you factor out global climate change entirely—let's say it doesn't exist—oil is finite and will become increasingly difficult (and thus expensive) to extract.

The start is very dangerous due to large groups all close together and steep downhills. Please reconsider this reverse route. 
From WP4 there’s no voltaren gel /spray/oil, they run out every year. Such big promotions and always poor delivery from them.
8467 2018-11-19 07:50:09 Our brains are rich in the omega-3 fatty acid DHA, so a link has been made between fish oil and brain development. It is thought that fish oil supplements taken by pregnant women may assist with foetal growth and brain development.

8472 2018-11-19 07:49:35 Sorry, just saw this reply now. One last thing. I think you're missing the point that more often than not, criticism IS a form of expressing ones opinion. And it's not necessarily bad. Critical thinking is an invaluable life skills.

8474 2018-11-19 07:49:15 I and almost everyone I communicate with simply do not trust the NDP with any oil production regulation authority. There is no assurance that such a move would help WCS prices and the downside risk exposure is too high. Nobody is forcing the producers to produce & sell at a loss.

8588 2018-11-19 07:23:07 @johnmunyes63  Although Kenya is a frontier oil & gas destination, the discoveries in Turkana have put Kenya on the map and made the oil industry look at Kenya as a potentially attractive investment destination #ProjectOilKE
8589 2018-11-19 07:23:04 There was no major oil crisis. Oil dropped below $30 for a few months and then recovered quickly. When you develop a 30 year oil sands project, you don't concern yourself with day to day prices. Notley and Trudeau introduced insane regulation and silly taxes, so investors left.

Rich & uninformed go for aersolized cooking sprays. Oil isn't really used here like we use it- it's mostly only to grease a pan or deep fry something.

8731 2018-11-19 06:55:58 They could be mining oil behind the backs of Ugandans then tomorrow they say the oil was fake and doesn't meet international standards plus other stories... this government I don't trust every bit of information from them.... maybe explain that to a kindergarten child not me
8732 2018-11-19 06:55:22 อยากแบบให้มันผ่านไปไวๆอ่ะ
8733 2018-11-19 06:55:17 Yeah, they're used to remove excess oil on your face

8735 2018-11-19 06:54:42 Wow ! I’m sure that guy Tommy is shaking after looking at those olive oil arms.
8736 2018-11-19 06:54:40 Moisturize with jojoba oil afterwards boo
8737 2018-11-19 06:54:38 If you're trying to remove the two tons of glitter on your titties, just slather them and baby oil and it'll wipe off

I mean my tits are still covered in a fucking ton of glitter but it's an amount of glitter that I can live with
8738 2018-11-19 06:54:13 Vegan butter or olive oil would be a more kind and sustainable ingredient in a stuffing recipe.

8742 2018-11-19 06:52:45 Bro oil will always be in high demand. Petrol is just one version of oil. What about asphalt? Plastic? Even fertilisers. We will always need oil even if we don't need it for fuel anymore and even that is not going to happen by 2040 more like 2100-2200.
8743 2018-11-19 06:52:23 Probably declare war since Venezuela also has oil and so sanctions alone would be counter-productive to the US empire.

8747 2018-11-19 06:52:00 So I actually DID this, except in the Real Life way, in which you are married to the artist; it costs YOU 150K (SOMEONE has to have the day job, to pay for oil paint); and, right after the Saatchi show he painted me for, he ran off with a 19 year old. -Like their version better.

Google it.

Do you know how much oil was sold in the world market between 1999 and 2014??? 
Google it.

Tell your readers what the PDP did with over $1trn in 16 years. I asked Google, it can't help.

8764 2018-11-19 06:47:12 And it was only until japan began striking south to take over colonies whos western masters had fallen to the 3rd reich did the US and UK actually step in to enforce a oil export embargo on japan, directly precipitating the pearl harbour strike and japan/US entry into WW2 proper.

8766 2018-11-19 06:46:56 But the entire divestment process is a bloody sham because a substantial part involves one PSU buying a stake in another. Ongc which should have been using it's funds to buy into oilfields when oil prices were low was forced to buy HPCL for $8bn or so.

8806 2018-11-19 06:38:15 So sad I knew that Hama's Gaza blowing up Israel was backed by Iran. Iran needs to move out of Syria pray Vladimir will force out Iran so he can benift from oil because Iran is threat to Israel. Iran out now Syria wanting Golan heights in the midst of it all cause they got help

9010 2018-11-19 05:59:21 Currently big oil has their claws too deep in the American government though. That's the first step, to weaken the influence big oil has over the government. 3/3
9011 2018-11-19 05:59:09 That penalty is not right. I know one young man working in the oil fields. He was making truck payments to get to work (cars really aren't feasible), had to have a home (paid rent) AND paid child support. He could afford insurance AND had to pay the fine.
9012 2018-11-19 05:58:58 Olive oil pakek yg apa nder?
9013 2018-11-19 05:58:56 So fast. Add oil.
9014 2018-11-19 05:58:32 The money IBB use in building 3rd mainland bridge came from oil windfall. 
If BUHARI's government lay it hands on such, definitely will do better
9015 2018-11-19 05:58:08 Try french green beans sautéed w/hot capacola and little olive oil. Instead of using mushroom soup, make a rue based sauce w/roasted garlic, rosemary & white wine.  Helluv good.
9016 2018-11-19 05:58:08 Yup, we tend to agree with you and call a hold. The factors have largely been external in terms of oil price and ZAR weakness. Both these have improved...but frankly our economic argument is that IT'S CHRISTMAS.

9051 2018-11-19 05:52:31 You were right to question it---he didn't see you in person, didn't look in your ears, so he was guessing you had some earwax (which olive oil would loosen), but instead you likely have an ear infection that needs different drops or pills
9052 2018-11-19 05:52:29 have owned MHG for a while and reducing into the recent run up. My understanding has been that even as prices have been volatile, they are on average the same as 2015 but there has been continued volume growth. Time to look at it may be if NOK catches up with oil

9141 2018-11-19 05:37:46 I agree that Trump and Kushner can't be trusted but if we're being totally honest with ourselves, isn't Trump just explicitly doing what those before him have done--look the other way with Saudi Arabia as long as the oil and cash flow in?
9142 2018-11-19 05:37:39 I understand, Sharyl. There are four pizza's I remember, fondly.

My first from the Prince of Pizza, basic and pure.

Pizza from the yearly school carnival.

Boston style, small and round with pools of oil in the curled pepperoni.

And Pica's in Upper Darby, just different.

Now?
9143 2018-11-19 05:37:12 I’m having the same problem and I found that coconut oil works!! Coconut oil doesn’t clog your pores. BUT if you already have oily skin, it can cause it to be too oily. So I got suggested to add it into my regular lotion!

9145 2018-11-19 05:36:48 Tag this idiot @VishalDadlani  also. I hope to see this post from you. If you dissent then have guts to value their persistent efforts to solve the oil crisis also.
9146 2018-11-19 05:36:30 Friends. The cold sore is under control. I burned it with peppermint oil- because tea tree oil tastes terrible when it gets in your mouth.

9152 2018-11-19 05:35:47 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
9153 2018-11-19 05:35:38 What you neglected to mention was the volume of satisfied clients @PropertyBrother have. They really did create ideal living spaces - at various budgets-according to clients. Weird that you would go to one launch before insinuating they’re hustlers hawking snake oil.
9154 2018-11-19 05:35:37 Except:
1. That is nonsense 
2. Most of that money would just go to the oil industry because royalties are way too low
9155 2018-11-19 05:35:28 This is the classic fake news story. Classic. MBS is surrounded by those who benefit from the rumor. Turkey's Erdogan, oil gamblers, anti-Trumpers, and deep state all benefit. Yet the story burned like a California wildfire across every mainstream outlet. It's narrative not news.

9161 2018-11-19 05:34:36 These pipelines would have created tens of thousands of jobs, generated billions in economic activity, and delivered fair market value for Canadian oil.

Even if just one of these three nation-building pipelines had been built as planned, Canadians wouldn’t be in this situation.
9162 2018-11-19 05:34:33 I actually turned to oils! I used peppermint because I hate the taste of tea tree oil. It burns a little more, but it kicked its butt!

9166 2018-11-19 05:33:54 Let’s make one thing clear: the reason we have to sell our oil at such a massive discount is because our energy companies don’t have access to international markets.

In fact, we have only one trading partner when it comes to oil – the United States.
9167 2018-11-19 05:33:51 I have often thought that Midnight Oil's 'Blue Sky Mine' would be very  appropriate for solar energy. I wonder what Peter Garrett would think?@simonahac @pgarrett

9169 2018-11-19 05:33:40 People blame military. Go and look at socioeconomic indicators of Egypt under Mubarak or South Korea under its generals or Brazil. Vast leaps of development.

9180 2018-11-19 05:31:33 I think he had told him, whether or not Talbot listens is the issue. I have heard that Koskinen is a very coachable goalie for a “vet”. Trust me I am pissed about the oilers but I think the goalie coach is not the issue.
9181 2018-11-19 05:31:27 #Japanese refiner Fuji Oil Co is set to resume Iranian crude purchases after #Japan received a waiver from U.S. sanctions on #Tehran, industry sources familiar with the matter said.
9182 2018-11-19 05:31:24 In your talks you mention that there aren’t any protests against Texas and California oil. And for good reason. Oil drilling regs stateside are pathetic when compared to Canadian regs. You should Interview some Canadian oilwell supervisors. It’ll blow your mind.

9199 2018-11-19 05:27:58 Agreed!! “CBD” has went so mainstream that people are thinking its only found in hemp, and that “Phytocannabinoid rich hemp oil” and “hemp oil” isn’t the same as “CBD”
9200 2018-11-19 05:27:47 I put an essential oil in my bath and it gave me like, a chemical burn or something all over the lower half of my back and that area
9201 2018-11-19 05:27:43 that's because he literally thought the department was about oil but it's actually about nuclear weapons and seems to have just differed to experts.

9262 2018-11-19 05:18:10 speaking about oil , this is one of the reasons why warlords of the north insisted on invading south in 1994 .They mobilized jihadists and tribesmen, and robbed the south,it was a mess looting and pillage. There has been considerable marginalization and army demobilization
9263 2018-11-19 05:17:53 The dollar was already hitting the roofs before GEJ left, the price of crude determines a lot in Nigeria sadly cos we depend majorly on oil export..until we diversify our economy, we will continue to have such issues

9277 2018-11-19 05:15:13 @PalmerReport Yeah trump and his non taxpaying buddies and his VP are energy and natural resource thieves.  Mining, Manipulation of oil, drilling in oceans on land everywhere.  Polluting our water sources and causing cancer and health issues. Yeah and dense pence and his gas co..
9278 2018-11-19 05:15:11 I've come to realize that this will be a long journey. At least I'll see now my country getting more representation when Germany attacks our submarines, Medina goes to meet FDR and Venezuela become the third biggest oil exporter to the US.

9280 2018-11-19 05:14:58 Trump has had an oil deal with Putin for years, and didn't care how many people were slaughtered to get oil out through a convenient port. Arms, Oil, all the same to Trump. He loves fossil fuels, and intends to continue making money. Complicit/GOP.
9281 2018-11-19 05:14:47 80% of the global oil demand will mean 80% of Saudi Arabia & Americas oil demand because most other countries, especially 1st world nations, are switching to renewable eco friendly energy sources. #GoGreen #RenewableEnergy #EndOilDependence #ProtectTheEnvironment #Resist
9282 2018-11-19 05:14:40 I agree with that.I have worked in the North Sea (oil and gas). I have worked in Norway and spent a lot of time in Amsterdam/Rotterdam 
The system you have is better equipped to deal with the ppl in your country. Your pop is small and Gov is close. But taxes for me is to high
9283 2018-11-19 05:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
9284 2018-11-19 05:14:27 Of course marijuana is not the same as crack. They are both different substances. But it’s like as different as using acrylic paint & oil paint. Likeeeee definitely not the same butttt also not that different.

9297 2018-11-19 05:12:27 Just burnt my forehead with oil when I put the frijoles a guisar, I’m not cutout for this housewife life
9298 2018-11-19 05:12:24 If you have any kind of oil, rub it on your face! then put a hot washcloth over it for a couple seconds to steam, then gently wipe it off. Extra virgin olive oil is very moisturizing! Coconut oil works but might clog your face pores but that shit is great for arms/legs.
9299 2018-11-19 05:12:24 Cyclonopedia, but data is the new oil.
9300 2018-11-19 05:12:19 A meal in 20 minutes! Pork chop grilled with smoked ham and olive oil.
9301 2018-11-19 05:12:06 Oh! As an update, I ended up packing the oil blend I had without crystals in it (just some herbs) so there's no reason they should confiscate a 10 ml clear tube with plant matter in it. And if they do, they're just jackasses.
9302 2018-11-19 05:12:03 So this is what Rust does to a man..How sad.

9313 2018-11-19 05:09:39 don't justify for the northern presence in south you have to blame those who launched war against south in 1994 and occupied it after violating all the signed agreements . oil will come as long as you digging in the earth nothing comes as easy mouthful to chew.
9314 2018-11-19 05:09:29 @Oil_Drop yup, Chia has to go. He will never be an NHL GM again after running a team with McDavid, Hall, Ebs, Nuge, Drai to 0.
9315 2018-11-19 05:09:15 I would entirely say yes with mynute exceptions. I wouldnt support the art if say a serial killer child rapist made it. For instance, even if i liked clown art i cant bring myself to like John Wayne Gacy's oil paintings because of specifically who it supports

9326 2018-11-19 05:07:51 What have we done in the past to checkmate over dependence on oil??? Stop pretending as if PDP 16yrs did any good to this nation. No infrastructure no intervention no human or capital development
9327 2018-11-19 05:07:51 The Maran - Pekan back road is a desolate route of sparse villages, oil palm plantations interspersed with wetlands and the mighty Pahang River always looking like its teetering on the brink of flooding.

9331 2018-11-19 05:07:16 Somethings just not right about that. It will be a long time before I will vote for Republicans again.Last one for Stole 10 trillion out of our national treasure slaughtered 9000 soldiers for a barrel oil in Iraq While binLaden ran free killed thousands of Americans on US soil.
9332 2018-11-19 05:07:15 Summat to do with oil prices.
9333 2018-11-19 05:07:11 Most electricity comes from what you are calling non-renewables.  An electric car simply burns coal, oil, natural gas, or uses nuclear power.  The tiny fraction of electricity coming from wind and solar is insignificant and worse yet for the environment.

9335 2018-11-19 05:06:40 Its all part of a plan to buy up oil infrastructure by the Canadian government. Price bottoms, Yanks sell out of their projects for pennies on the dollar, Canadian government steps in, buys it all up to "stabalize" the industry and boom, we have a national oil industry. Norway.

9337 2018-11-19 05:06:15 Our Govt has banned oil and gas exploration. Gas expected to run out few years. Electricity shortages looming in future. We have huge seabed exploration area expected to have huge harvest potential. Trying to force us towards 'green' alternatives.

Oil is a commodity and anyone crying to the government to "do something about the price!" is a goddamned leech.

Then tell me why, after 15 Saudi men were discovered to have been among the 19 9/11 hijackers, the Bush Administration attacked Afghanistan, then Iraq, while Bush held photo ops with Saudi princes? The US has had a peculiar (OIL!) relationship with the Saudis for decades.
9356 2018-11-19 05:02:37 I feel a little bad for Oil fans, but mega fuck their management. You lucked into multiple first overalls, at least 1 generational talent and are barely better than multiple rebuilding teams. Get fucked.
9357 2018-11-19 05:02:18 I’m so bad at reading directions. One time I cooked for @amandakasss and I accidentally put coconut lavender lotion in our food instead of coconut oil. We are lotion for dinner.

9385 2018-11-19 04:57:20 The SNP are as dishonest as brexiters - "Scotland props up UK", "They stole our oil","We'll have a £1bn/yr oil fund", "We'll have a Scandi-style welfare with low taxes", "The UK is holding Scotland back" etc and baselessly promising a land of milk & honey after indy.

Stop it. You deserve better. We deserve better. She is not for the people but rather corporations.

9404 2018-11-19 04:53:52 Add some ham slices in top of that toast with tomato, and some olive oil before adding the tomato and enjoy.

Next time you should try porra/salmorejo and alioli.

9412 2018-11-19 04:53:16 But damn thieves oil is rad. It smells so fucking good, and is a very effective anti microbial/viral/septic. I legit think I'm gonna use it as a cologne or something. Plus I hear it's good w/ cider or coffee.
9413 2018-11-19 04:53:00 If you honk at me .010 seconds after the light turns green I’m going to put my car into park, change my oil, check my tire pressure, eat, take a nap, and reverse into the back of your car pusc.
9414 2018-11-19 04:52:58 i want a oil diffuser so bad...like so bad. idek why
9415 2018-11-19 04:52:40 CW your unbridled enthusiasm for the annihilation of the CDN oil industry is notable. Misguided mind you, but energetic to be sure.
9416 2018-11-19 04:52:33 My first job was as a driveway attendant to a service station. People loved it. Check your oil, your water and tyres as well as wash your windscreen. All while filling up the petrol tank. It was a great job. Now, nowhere to be seen. #jobs #auspol

9420 2018-11-19 04:51:58 Alright olive oil
9421 2018-11-19 04:51:22 it's lifechanging!!! also all year round for a similar flavor but not quite as stuffing-y my fav chips are deep river rosemary and olive oil flavor
9422 2018-11-19 04:51:17 I was in the renewable energy field 10 years ago. Specifically biodiesel. The inability of small and mid sized producers to compete in the vegetable oil futures market to hedge profuction cost killed the industry. That coupled with the mandate of selling carbon credits
9423 2018-11-19 04:50:53 Haha I'm buying a legacy gt/b bring on the oil
9424 2018-11-19 04:50:24 @GovHawaii Now I get it. The reason Big Island gasoline is STILL so high even tho oil prices have dropped dramatically is so WE can pay 4 the new RAIL in Honolulu w/ its A/C & Wifi. Surprise surprise.
9425 2018-11-19 04:50:16 No way would the Oil do that. That’s a lot of quantity for the 3rd best player in the world (after Marner and Matthews of course).
9426 2018-11-19 04:50:12 Sebab oil cleanser tu. Mungkin awak tak tahan dgn ingredient (cth : mineral oi/alcohol) yg ada dlm tu. Boleh cari cleansing oil yg xde ing yg awak allergic. Atau boleh try cleansing milk.
9427 2018-11-19 04:50:05 I didn’t realize there was a draft in that league? Smart call though, tank and get the #1!!! Oil likely pick up the entire salary as well. Cap friendly.
9428 2018-11-19 04:50:03 Coconut oil. Why?
9429 2018-11-19 04:50:02 entirely covering myself in coconut oil and listening to yeezus is self care

9436 2018-11-19 04:49:06 I’m still not over the fact that I paid $85 for a oil change
9437 2018-11-19 04:49:01 Fuel prices are continually on the downfall. The crude oil price in international market is stable these days that's why fuel prices are behaving well. But, thats the one thing by which RaGa blackmails the whole nation.

9438 2018-11-19 04:48:59 10:46pm and I'm in the mood to install a new vanity light in the bathroom, install a new power outlet 4 studs over and mount a tv in my office, and maybe change my Jeeps oil and rotate the tires.

What the hell was in my beer?
9439 2018-11-19 04:48:44 BS conspiracy theory. The oil industry can outspend NGOs 100 to 1. Think FFS! It takes $10B with a $1B Coker and 10yrs to build a refinery. It's too late. It should have happened 20 yrs ago.
9440 2018-11-19 04:48:21 This is when my alarm normally goes off. Midnight oil being burned.

9443 2018-11-19 04:48:01 @ThaneCityPolice minor oil spill witnessed near khopat ST stand near the borivali biryani centre turning towards khopat. Just got saved by maintaining balance. Pls take note.

9447 2018-11-19 04:47:49 Soybean is not a good target, We should buy more because of it’s cheap and we don’t produce them anymore. But it serves to give a signal that we don’t care gain or loss, as long as US not abide the rules, we will resist. Actually eat less pork and oil is good for health!

9464 2018-11-19 04:44:28 The Japanese are right to buy oil from Iran. I do not see why a country like the United States can prevent one country from trading with another. It's undemocratic and anti-liberal.
9465 2018-11-19 04:44:24 You would KILL to have Tkachuk wearing an Oilers jersey.

9480 2018-11-19 04:41:06 Your overhead includes gas, oil, brakes, tires, insurance, registration. And after all that? You divide your net Earning by Hours Spent (back to your home). Then you get a W-2 Tax Form next year. So, in my opinion; you need at least $20 Minimum to make this a Worthwhile Hobby.
9481 2018-11-19 04:41:05 This is so true, Pakistan National Shipping Cooperation hold 60 vessels (oil tankers, container ships) back in 1970s now they have only 7, all hail to nationalization

9503 2018-11-19 04:36:59 Wait, slow down. So you think big oil created a climate change hoax, then spent millions trying to discredit it BEFORE it became public, with the end goal of killing their own industry?  Is that the gist of your claim?

9538 2018-11-19 04:29:38 Lube! Baby oil, Vaseline...... something like that 
9539 2018-11-19 04:29:38 some extra virgin olive oil pussy ass nigga
9540 2018-11-19 04:29:30 I need all of my followers to message me and remind me to get my oil changed at 11 tomorrow. I need to be annoyed enough that I actually go do it.

9545 2018-11-19 04:28:46 What oil revenues?
9546 2018-11-19 04:28:39 Why would you use oil when you can have pussy Juice my long time friend?
9547 2018-11-19 04:28:14 INCの構築でも組むか
9548 2018-11-19 04:27:57 Who cares. Trump put the hex on Exxon Rex. He left outta the West Wing and has said not one public word to tell us the truth about Trump.  So let his aw-shucks ass stay buried for millions of years...like crude oil.
9549 2018-11-19 04:27:55 wen all calculations are negative. Hummm. and someone tell u in a country with no constant electricity for over 16yrs that unemployment will not rise... Abah! and u feel that is a news. In a country where all we have is unrefined crude oil for export and only to import it refined
9550 2018-11-19 04:27:50 ねむ
9551 2018-11-19 04:27:28 Kill them and sell their organs on the black market or sell them into slavery. I heard Africa buying people like how the US be invading countries for oil.
9552 2018-11-19 04:27:07 just got off the phone w my mom and she told me probably a solid 15 times to check my oil in the morning I don't even want to go home anymore 
9553 2018-11-19 04:27:06 Hmmm? Idk how it would turn out honestly . You’d have to put a lot of Pam oil so it doesn’t stick though

9558 2018-11-19 04:25:44 Texture of balm and oil is different.  So it also depends on your skin type which one suits u better
9559 2018-11-19 04:25:18 I’m on week two of taking CBD oil. I don’t feel any different while awake but my dreams lately have been super lucid. Causation doesn’t mean correlation but I feel very busy while I sleep.
9560 2018-11-19 04:25:04 @google what happens if i drink an entire bottle of olive oil
9561 2018-11-19 04:24:51 All I see is beard  oil. Where’s the mustache  oil?
9562 2018-11-19 04:24:50 Cheap gas for his cult. Higher fuel prices could snuff out economic growth and bring on the republican recession 18 months early. With no Iranian oil (thanks donnie) we are stuck licking the Sauds nuts and they know we have no choice. Again. Way to go El Douchebag Donnie u putz
9563 2018-11-19 04:24:03 @google what happens if i drank an entire bottle of olive oil
9564 2018-11-19 04:24:01 I'm gonna have to disagree. We as citizens are not to blame. Not only is it the oil companies who are the primary cause. But i, and anyone under thirty really, was never in a position to do anything about it.
9565 2018-11-19 04:24:01 what would happen if i chugged olive oil
9566 2018-11-19 04:23:47 Corrosion is expanding still more! It’s invading the lubricating oil (?) system of the simulation body!  (Maya)

9567 2018-11-19 04:23:04 Well, Greenpeace, start a clean sustainable palm oil plantation and set an example for others to follow.
9568 2018-11-19 04:22:57 The oil has been checked

9572 2018-11-19 04:22:08 1/3 coconut oil, 2/3 avocado oil, couple drops of whatever essential oil u like as fragrance. Shake it up in a pump bottle. Use  a couple pumps after u shower while yr hand and body and face are still wet. Rub it all over. Pat dry. Effective and inexpensive.
9573 2018-11-19 04:22:00 Physician's Formula BB Cream Argan oil blend.  It's thick and color rich enough to be foundation, but feels a bit airy when drying.  Perfect for if you're doing something outdoors and you don't want to weigh 100 pounds of make up and still look flawless.
9574 2018-11-19 04:21:51 The guy with the justice beret I would write a 200k au about being oil painting majors, slow burn, friends to lovers, self-insert ofc. What has happened to me

9579 2018-11-19 04:21:09 I do too but the hot water cuts all of the oil your skin needs so it dries it out. I can’t wash my face with cold water though. 
9580 2018-11-19 04:21:09 oil doesn't make that much for brunei in recent years , they need to change. Diverse their investments and China can help
9581 2018-11-19 04:21:00 Sis u make it Sis with lemon juice distilled water apple cider and with tea tree oil
9582 2018-11-19 04:20:49 Oh..with oil going down, I don't think they will come up with any scheme
9583 2018-11-19 04:20:45 It’s sad that some people have to always learn the hard way; Trump was an obvious snake oil salesman that too many Americans were unable to identify.

Only God! He will do it!
Keeping Greg in prayer
9587 2018-11-19 04:19:34 No doubt energy drives this economy. It's just the filthy oil that has to go. Time for a change, maybe something a little less gritty or try this one out!  Something that doesn't poison the world. Give it a go, you might like it. Prove to us that all Albertans  aren't assholes.

9591 2018-11-19 04:19:03 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
9592 2018-11-19 04:19:02 for my birthday, I would like:
- someone to pay for or do an oil change for my car
- a massage
- a cordless dyson vacuum

9593 2018-11-19 04:18:59 Norway is a rich country because of (gasp) - oil!  The idiot left in America want to shut down our fossil fuel resources.  I guess they think wind and solar power will facilitate their wet dream of “Medicare for All.”
9594 2018-11-19 04:18:52 #Homecoming already rubbing my ass wit cooking oil. @amazon coming for a roster this award season and I don’t see too much in their way. The camera cuts and visual tastebud is on FYE.

9596 2018-11-19 04:18:45 What you have failed to figure in is the offshoot jobs and in turn paycheques that a healthy oil industry creates.
Everything from restaurants to real estate.
9597 2018-11-19 04:18:26 So-called journalists who recoil in horror at calling Trump a liar, who lavish sympathy on husband-hunting Monica while excoriating Hillary, who seek Trump voters in diners yet ignore kids in cages, these stenographers can't tell me oil is greasy! Their opinions mean nothing! 1/2
9598 2018-11-19 04:18:17 What's going on with the WCS oil price? And what's at stake for Alberta AND the whole country? I'll be in studio at @BNN tomorrow at 8:20am (Alberta time) to discuss. @atbfinancial

9604 2018-11-19 04:17:25 Nagy seizes up like an engine without oil in the 4th quarter. He plays not to lose instead of playing to win. Horrible play calling in the second half. As usual defense wins it for us.

9607 2018-11-19 04:17:00 Taking the stance, "the world wants oil and we have oil, the rest isn't our concern" .. that's just not enough for me. I want real leadership. Gutsy, forward-thinking, speaking the truth even if it's not popular Leadership. No idea where I'm going to find that. But I'm hopeful!

9612 2018-11-19 04:15:59 Maybe for your industry. Notley will never get any credit from the oil industry, she’s a sheep in wolves clothing. The timing for her and Justin to be in power at once has been crippling to the oil industry. Every other oil bearing country is flat out busy, we’re “surviving”
9613 2018-11-19 04:15:43 Today I bought two bottles of oil so fancy, the cashier thought they were bottles of wine and tried to card me.
9614 2018-11-19 04:15:37 You'll need Anna Napolatene 00 flour, from Italy, they sell it here.

2 TBl. spoons virgin olive oil
41/4 cups flour
2 tsp. salt
2 tsp. sugar
2 dry yeast
Mangiare
9615 2018-11-19 04:15:21 Finally trying coconut oil on my hair 
9616 2018-11-19 04:15:19 Get to know Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-TX):

- Opposes Medicare for all (HR 676)
- Opposes college for all (HR 1880)
- Opposes taxing Wall St. transactions (HR 1144)
- 2nd largest recipient of Oil & Gas money (2018)
- Voted 3x to increase Trump's military budget (HR 2810, 5515 & 6157)
9617 2018-11-19 04:15:02 If it’s underneath the skin and not on top then the tea tree oil wouldn’t react. Perhaps it’s a very tiny “blood blister” type thing. A bag strap tugged a little too hard there or something similar. Rare to not have it hurt but it can happen, are you diabetic?
9618 2018-11-19 04:14:57 石油王よりＩＴ長者なのか・・・？
9619 2018-11-19 04:14:55 @CoachLesMiles Congrats Coach Miles! Tiger fans will be pulling for the Jayhawks ! Was blessed to talk to you on your Radio show from an Oil Rig in the Gulf the week Katrina ended up coming. Saying there was a storm brewing. Who would have known?! Then got to meet you at the CWS
9620 2018-11-19 04:14:52 The important thing, in my opinion , is to get the oil infused properly. Don’t try to cook with the actual plant. Once you’ve got infused oil you can use it for pretty much everything.
9621 2018-11-19 04:14:51 If you like a lot of mustard oil on your éclair, join our club!
9622 2018-11-19 04:14:43 If, as I suspect, you don't believe the ahistorical and foundationally contradictory nonsense that you're peddling, just stop repeating it. I heard you the first time and I told you I don't want any snake oil. Try to sell it to somebody with a weak mind.
9623 2018-11-19 04:14:39  The wood is a problem. But, shortening works well (even the veg kind.) I have used veg oil when nothing else was on hand but *do not* use too much. Gooey yuckiness along the bottom. 
9624 2018-11-19 04:14:30 They have a 5-7 yr window to sale their oil. Parts of the EU banning the sale of gas or diesel vehicles by 2030.
9625 2018-11-19 04:14:08 Many trees and leaves contain oil..which burns...quite well
9626 2018-11-19 04:14:07 Could've sworn it was an oil painting
9627 2018-11-19 04:14:07 I use the Valium too. Also use the vaginal cannabis oil suppositories. for sex issues related to Narcolepsy with Cataplexy. Many of us have lost our sex lives to narcolepsy. I did but fought to get it back. Success! I see a gyn, women’s sexual health specialist
9628 2018-11-19 04:13:43 Yes ....the oil roller
9629 2018-11-19 04:13:29 It was a good plan. It just wasn't realistic. The cats would scatter, and frying things in hot oil was terrifying. And there was laundry.
9630 2018-11-19 04:13:05 we need a national water pipeline piggybacked onto the existing oil pipeline infrastructure 

there’s absolutely no reason we can’t manage our freshwater resources better
9631 2018-11-19 04:13:02 US will invade SA. Just looking for an excuse. No such thing as allies when the US is concerned. If China at some point backs RMB with gold, US will take SA oil to back USD. I know it sounds nuts but make note of it because it will happen
9632 2018-11-19 04:12:56 Just learned in class that we have 50 years left of oil and honestly I'm hyped, I loved the Mad Max movies

9636 2018-11-19 04:12:47 I can’t find my oil pen 
9637 2018-11-19 04:12:45 Are you saying you don't believe there is urgent need to change oil consumption worldwide to reduce the impact of climate change? Don't you think as an oil-producing province/country we have responsibility to chart a path? For our own people & for the world?
9638 2018-11-19 04:12:45 Nice. I pussied out on the oil. Mcdavid always steals my money when I bet against the oilers.

9640 2018-11-19 04:12:29 Peter Handscomb at 5 instead of Stoinis? Love the oil but our batting is a concern. 
9641 2018-11-19 04:12:23 Know of oil of clove directly on the tooth. Never heard of oregano but whatever works!

9643 2018-11-19 04:11:38 Of course, I agree! But this is my passion and profession, I work with a plethora of skin. I just want people to actually go to reputable sources and not gyal who use coconut oil and st.ives apricot scrub everyday or their boy who uses Dove/Irish spring on their face
9644 2018-11-19 04:11:36 Srry e hear that n yes Everytime I rent car from any Rent-A-Car place it always have no oil in car or it not clean n they tell me o we can put oil or clean so

9647 2018-11-19 04:11:05 Lefty conspiracy theories:

-Bush “stole” the election in 2000
-Bush went into Iraq “for oil”
-Trump worked with the Russians to “steal” the 2016 election
-the governor of Georgia “stole” the gubernatorial race in 2018

Yall really are fucking insane 
9648 2018-11-19 04:11:01 The gold top one ! I think it has coconut oil in it
9649 2018-11-19 04:10:54 YES!! the only annoying thing is that the oil gets stuck or whatever but I took a shower after like usual and it was fine
9650 2018-11-19 04:10:41 Tumor-gone? This guy sells an herbal “cancer cure” and you are ok with that? He prays on the dying and hopeless with his snake oil.

9652 2018-11-19 04:10:30 the reply to your question is the cheap pricing of the Saudis 12,000,000 barrels of crude oil per day basically petrodollar plus 2,000,000,000,000 $ of Saudis money in USA Banks.

9656 2018-11-19 04:10:11 Why should Gov pay for clean up of orphaned oil wells? Why not the oil companies that put them there. Those companies put them there, made millions from them then abandon them for tax payers to have to pay to clean up.
9657 2018-11-19 04:10:09 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
9658 2018-11-19 04:10:01 "Oil" is the favorite word of people building online dating profiles in the U.S. states of Texas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota.

9661 2018-11-19 04:09:47 Wait... why are we importing any oil from the middle east if we are exporting oil overseas? I realize most of our import of oil is from Canada but we still import a good amount from the middle east. Why? If we are exporting so much. Why are we not energy self sufficient?
9662 2018-11-19 04:09:46 Someone said it recently: for 20 mins a night when Connors on the ice, we’re elite. The other 40 maybe league worst.
9663 2018-11-19 04:09:25 Maybe OPEC has a bit of vested interest in predicting high oil demand? And even if they are right, we know China is choking on pollution & motivated. As solar becomes cheaper & readily available do you think oil will continue to be the desired product?
9664 2018-11-19 04:09:25 Lol yea that's oil. It's pretty good
9665 2018-11-19 04:09:19 So that's 2 votes for no carbon taxes and pumping tons of oil.
9666 2018-11-19 04:09:05 When you know your perfume oil game is top notch. I really be thinking like man I smell good.
9667 2018-11-19 04:09:02 That's crazy . I've never had a mask or peel like that.  Why not wet your face with the peel on and slather with olive oil to get it off easier once she saw how sticky it was? That hurt my face
9668 2018-11-19 04:08:54 Do we have oil? 
9669 2018-11-19 04:08:28 I got one for you—olive oil and sea salt on vanilla ice cream
9670 2018-11-19 04:08:26 @SeekVision33 I just watched your video Sacred Secretion / Christ oil/ True Anointing/ HEAVEN ON EARTH. Thank you so much. I posted it on Twitter, Gab, the Q prayer board, and another site. I hope everyone sees what info. you have to offer. thank you
9671 2018-11-19 04:08:17 You have swallowed the company propaganda haven't you. Open your eyes man. Corrupt Oil Palm Giants have circumnavigated the RSPO for years. Guess you believe in the tooth fairy too. 
9672 2018-11-19 04:07:46 I’ve had sex a million times and have used evening primrose oil in my vag for the last 3 days and I’m just getting IRREGULAR contractions in my back that keeps stopping. WATSON GET TF OUT OF ME.

9677 2018-11-19 04:07:25 They make a their oil capital international, so, politicians can't use that money. It's save for any economic crisis worldwide. (Sorry for my english).
9678 2018-11-19 04:07:16 Don’t make us fools it’s as if you discovered oil. What’s the brand of their bike and what are the resources. Are you saying they start to manufacture the engine from scratch. Please we have enough problems don’t give us more.
9679 2018-11-19 04:07:16 Wow you almost found oil!
9680 2018-11-19 04:07:15 i lost the pick jawn gave me and. my trees confetti just got oil stained bevaude i didnt know my phone wad fucked up

9683 2018-11-19 04:06:22 Yo dis black henny smoother then Baby oil 
9684 2018-11-19 04:06:14 Well,what is there that could possibly be more important to nation’s ‘business’;the crisis in the oil patch caused by faux greens who are foreign agents hamstringing one of our main wealth creators,crisis of illegal aliens swarming our borders & swamping our immigration process?
9685 2018-11-19 04:06:01 If you are a Purdue football fan and live in West Lafayette, which game do you attend Saturday?

Purdue at Indiana, Memorial Stadium for the Old Oaken Bucket or West Lafayette vs. Evansville Memorial for the Class 3A title at Lucas Oil Stadium?
9686 2018-11-19 04:06:01 Bout to rub up with some shilling oil n vicks 2 
9687 2018-11-19 04:05:47 Keep an eye on oil level. Needle and seat could be stuck and making oil as well. Will build up again over time if it is. Leaks past rings over night. Common.
9688 2018-11-19 04:05:44 wa nae chicken oil ang mang inasal wtf
9689 2018-11-19 04:04:57 Wrong. The carbon tax is about 8c€ / l , while the TIPP (tax on oil products) is 60c€ / l for gazoline and 42c€ / l for diesel.
9690 2018-11-19 04:04:48 @RepSwalwell If it was the 18th century, this goof would be threatening to come to your homes with boiling oil. Do you ever wonder why our forefathers, true patriots, made it the 2nd Amendment. Free Speech then right to bear arms. You should be embarrassed.

9698 2018-11-19 04:03:58 i picked up an anti-breakage hair oil from ogx and i really hope it does my hair some good, but i don't really like the heavy smell i get from it like i just left the salon, i always feel so unlike myself
9699 2018-11-19 04:03:54 Wow, with that tune and supporting mods the engine should be completely bulletproof. You might want to try running a straight 50 weight oil and letting her warm up good before driving to help with blow by, consumption and maybe even squeeze a bit more torque.
9700 2018-11-19 04:03:51 ぎゅぅっ
9701 2018-11-19 04:03:40 I try not to judge but I heard my brother making himself food and I went into the kitchen to see the aftermath and it was frozen French fries drenched in vegetable oil and cinnamon 
9702 2018-11-19 04:03:40 Brussel sprouts roasted with Sweet potatoes,olive oil, garlic and pine nuts. Yum or Brussel sprout chips so good!
9703 2018-11-19 04:03:31 And if there were an Energy East pipeline then those businesses out east would make the logical choice of buying much cheaper Alberta oil than overseas oil (and spend the money they save refitting their refineries, yes).
9704 2018-11-19 04:03:26 Did it help? Saints, Rams, Bears, KC all adding talent. Packers have a Ferrari at QB and try to race it with tires from the Discount Mart, oil from Dollar General, and a driver from a high school drivers ed class. They’ve wasted Rodgers career
9705 2018-11-19 04:03:07 Straight organic jojoba oil

9707 2018-11-19 04:02:24 It’s ok to cook as long as you don’t smoke olive oil .
9708 2018-11-19 04:02:03 Amazing. And like Katrina, the BP Oil Spill, Flint, and Puerto Rico, the media will quickly lose interest and move on to the next exciting thing. Fixing things is much harder than blowing them to pieces.
9709 2018-11-19 04:01:55 @KevOnStage feel belly laughing with my husband. Hitting the poor people facts. We laughing cause the rent, changing the oil in the car and everything all applies to what we do. LoL!


9710 2018-11-19 04:01:53 Given the way they are digging everywhere in Bombay, I really do hope they strike oil, discover another life form or find the joke.

I wasn't enlisted.

I was recruited.  Many were.  Cold war was an economic and enginee'rs war.

Who commissioned our nuke fleet?

Who went to Saudi?  Drop oil below $20 bbl?.  Crazy stuff

Navy nukes. Petroleum engineers.
9716 2018-11-19 04:01:10 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but I want to take a moment to thank them.
9717 2018-11-19 04:00:51 Face wash and a little bit of tea tree oil on the pimples should do the trick

9724 2018-11-19 03:59:15 See, you consider Dems that accept money from Wall St, big oil, big insurance, and big pharma as “not the enemies”, when in fact that’s exactly what they are.
That means you are not a progrssive, btw. You’re a neo-liberal. We’re done with those.

9730 2018-11-19 03:58:08 Melange of miscellaneous edible prepared food ingredients, where the base is typically a vegetable. A sauce which is usually either cream based or Oil & Vinegar based is optional
9731 2018-11-19 03:58:08 Why have gas prices not followed the same declining trend of our oil prices? Presumably we use our oil to make our fuel, why haven’t gas prices dropped to $0.50 or $0.30 per litre? How much do retailers need to make?
9732 2018-11-19 03:58:07 Totolin oxy. Atau tea tree oil.

PLS CONFIRM??
9735 2018-11-19 03:57:50 I am sure Edmonton will be “proud” of your action to fight to lock AB oil in the ground.
9736 2018-11-19 03:57:47 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
9737 2018-11-19 03:57:37 The aloe and coconut oil seems it’s iffy, over oily scalp or dry can cause dandruff
9738 2018-11-19 03:57:34 oh dali ilang salonpas ba kailangan mo? efficascent oil?

9742 2018-11-19 03:56:49 We'll yeah, would you start with fish oil.

9744 2018-11-19 03:56:01 Why was your mama being investigated by the UN for oil for food progress in Iraq. In case you don't know she Banazir Bhutto has misappropriated $149 million. UN closed the investigation because BB was killed she was a dacco Rani. Bloody corrupt woman, your mother was.

9747 2018-11-19 03:55:49 But there really isn't many worse teams. Yes the top end is pretty dynamic but there is nothing underneath and that is scary considering what this roster looked like when McDavid was drafted.
9748 2018-11-19 03:55:44 LINDEN: All eastbound lanes of the Great Western Hwy have re-opened near Martin Place after an earlier oil spill. Traffic back to normal.
9749 2018-11-19 03:55:40 Why call it frackfreewa when wells in WA have been successfully and safely fracked and producing 500 million bbls oil in the last 50 years?
9750 2018-11-19 03:55:40 Always have, pretty Obvious but Iraq was the Country that took the hit after GHW Bushes Kuwait Invasion, both about Oil!
9751 2018-11-19 03:55:28 You're so welcome! And remember, the longer you simmer, the more flavorful the stock will be. And when using it for ramen, always use a tare. For me, one serving of ramen is 2 cups of broth. For that I make a tare of 1tbsp soy sauce, 1tbsp sesame oil, 1tsp sake and /1
9752 2018-11-19 03:55:20 That's one industry in Norway, controlled by the government. Venezuela has much more than just oil. Think harder. If that's possible.
9753 2018-11-19 03:55:18 Low carb whole wheat wraps with butter and natural peanut butter. Do an experiment to see what your favorite temperature is to serve butter. Thai curry without rice. An Ethiopian meal (palm oil) with a secret spoon to cut out some injera. Mascarpone cheese.
9754 2018-11-19 03:55:16 And it’s mostly fish oil
9755 2018-11-19 03:55:00 It is literally someone’s job to oil up and massage @JenSelter ‘s butt and I just wanna know where I apply
9756 2018-11-19 03:54:44 The issue now is the $19 price is self-correcting. The "Shut-In" of oil production is being considered as legislation by the Province of Alberta to not forfeit fair value of the resources that belong to the people of Alberta. OPEC might shut-in usa at the same time. Oh boy,
9757 2018-11-19 03:54:27 Our future is not with oil. Right or wrong, biumen is seen as the new asbestos. We need to wrap our heads around the realities we face and build a new economy. The sooner, the better.
9758 2018-11-19 03:54:18 Congrats to tonight's @EdmontonOilers 50/50 winner Simmerdeep Gill who took home $67,905 with ticket 194124C. Thank you, #Oilers fans, for supporting Canadian Cancer Society (@cancersociety) on #HockeyFightsCancer!

9764 2018-11-19 03:53:08 Don't forget the Cheney presidency and the plan to divvy up of Iraq for US oil interests (before their WMD pretext).

9766 2018-11-19 03:52:57 Well even better... The energy companies are slowly transitioning to clean sources. The last hold out is @exxonmobil, they recently doubled down on murder...  I mean oil.

Energy companies could be the leaders in clean energy, they have the funds to lead the way & save humanity.
9767 2018-11-19 03:52:53 Nope, and I tested it with tea tree oil, no reaction. Usually that would burn on either an abrasion or sensitive skin but I might as well have rubbed water on it

9770 2018-11-19 03:52:35 Sometimes sitting in silence with a roaring fire, hot tea with CBD oil, and snoring pups reminds you of how grateful you are for such things 
9771 2018-11-19 03:52:34 I dunno . Are you being cheeky or are you really unaware of oil, pharmaceutical, health insurance companies; student and credit loaners; Monsanto, ConAgra, et al.
9772 2018-11-19 03:52:28 Give'em a medal, palm oil plantations, another human invented method for extinction.
9773 2018-11-19 03:52:23 It didn’t taste good girl. It was trash. The sauces were to sweet I couldn’t taste my food. The broccoli was under cooked and didn’t have anything on it and when I asked for butter they gave me some oil that belongs on movie theater popcorn.
9774 2018-11-19 03:52:19 Hyperinflation is not a policy, it's an effect of creating money from thin air. 

Norway's government controls its oil industry. Why isn't Norway in a crisis? 

Try harder.

9778 2018-11-19 03:52:01 It’s either equity or debt...but it is quite obviously neither as it has a use case far beyond “expectation of profit.” Seems to me like it’d be equating a proprietary synthetic oil to a security. I dunno though, I’m open to insight...
9779 2018-11-19 03:51:53 Wow have been having a low grade panic attack for the last couple of hours. Heart beat UP. Feeling dizzy. Not being able to think or breath very well... My dumb ass bought a new chapstick with Almond oil in it. Ya girl allergic to nuts.

9781 2018-11-19 03:51:37 Without "Takeaway capacity" (Pipeline/Rail/Truck/Port/Terminal) ~ the un-integrated producers have no where to store their oil production at all - every storage is FULL ~ so they sell at a loss to get it taken away. USA is getting paid to take away canada oil. 2/2

9790 2018-11-19 03:51:10 Because we not only know there is a school of thought which believes the OIL Nationalization of Iraqi resources was a MISTAKE, as a gambling man myself - that's you, some of our leadership could have been anticipating such misadventures since about the 1950's.  Hope its worth it.

9797 2018-11-19 03:50:03 Hyperinflation, failure to produce any exports other than oil. Two major problems that contributed to Venezuela's downfall, coupled with enactment of socialism- Gov control of private industry, killed economic growth. Happy?
9798 2018-11-19 03:49:51 Best way to help with oil burn is to run a straight 50 weight but you need to let the car warm up and lot and don’t want to run it in the winter time if it gets really cold.
9799 2018-11-19 03:49:48 He should but the other guy will go first, which is shameful.
9800 2018-11-19 03:49:46 “Oh I’m takin yo car 2moro mines need a oil change”  y’all boys stay single
9801 2018-11-19 03:49:35 See for me I have to wash my hair every day or it goes down a shade from oil, but I have very little body odor and don't even need to use soap so this is just backwards for me
9802 2018-11-19 03:49:27 He used his pen. He pardoned a bunch of awful criminals the weeks before he left office. He blocked the Keystone pipeline allowing Warren Buffet to carry the oil by train for far more cost. He was an a-hole.

9806 2018-11-19 03:48:54 I’m not buying into that excuse for this season. Team had a great start with a tough schedule. How can that team suddenly forget how to play hockey? I’m leaning more towards a coaching issue at this point.

9821 2018-11-19 03:46:48 With due respect to the red-hot Chiasson, outside of 97, 29 & 93 there is no other forward of note on this roster and don't get me started on the defence. Some decent pieces along the blueline but a terrible mix.

9823 2018-11-19 03:46:14 I am running 20.5lb of boost so yeah, you are 100% right there. I would think my Air Oil Separator would help with oil consumption some since it scrubs a lot of the oil vapors from going into the intake, it drains it back into the oil pan.

9830 2018-11-19 03:45:35 Says the guy who supports a President that is selling US Residents in order to keep oil mone flowing into his pockets
9831 2018-11-19 03:45:30 Lol, too many ethics violations to list on more than 2 or 3 tweets at least. The one I saw someone tweet today was that Trudeau, in cahoots with  his billionaire friends, intentionally blockaded Western oil to deflate the 
price. They then made billions trading it. I'd believe it
9832 2018-11-19 03:45:03 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together

9843 2018-11-19 03:43:35 I’m willing to give Notley the benefit of the doubt, that she has legitimately realized the importance of oil to our economy. Being in government, especially in tough times should have been a serious awakening for this accidental government.
9844 2018-11-19 03:43:31 Ya have to wonder ....what goes on in a 6 figure hotel trip....l mean just think about it.  No Dt......what's she doing. ..oil change,  tires rotated?   Just saying.

9847 2018-11-19 03:43:18 It’s TMac inefficiently utilizing his roster. It’s the shitty roster Chia built. It’s the shitty organization Katz built. 

We’re stuck until something deeper changes.

9851 2018-11-19 03:42:20 I went to my doctor without success.  Then my "death camp church" anointed me with oil and prayed for me and I was healed of an incurable blood disease.  

You lose.

9854 2018-11-19 03:41:53 Where is that promised great Alberta Energy and Federal Oil Spill Contingency Response Plan? ...didn’t they figure on the existence of weather?
9855 2018-11-19 03:41:45 I just know you smell like coconut oil shea butter and unconditional love
9856 2018-11-19 03:41:40 So this whole time I thought it was pronounced jojoba oil but it’s jojoba 
9857 2018-11-19 03:41:35 Shea butter blended with a little coconut oil.
9858 2018-11-19 03:41:29 Researchers have long been aware of improvements in the absorption of food carotenoids when oils like extra virgin olive oil are included in a recipe or meal that features carotenoid-rich foods and Tomato. #AceAgro #MINvsCHI #Bears
9859 2018-11-19 03:41:28 After my showers I’ve been rubbing my body with hot mixture of Shea butter and tea tree oil as long as I’m not in a rush. I’m trying to have my skin glowing.
9860 2018-11-19 03:41:27 I wait on Quenneville until the new GM gets to pick him. Shouldn't force a coach down a GM's throat.

9862 2018-11-19 03:41:05 @Timcast If you want to save the environment, dig into the technologies that have been bought by oil companies, like Shell, or the stuff that is hidden in deep black projects in Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Ratheon, etc. Stuff paid for by taxpayers, never sees the light of day!
9863 2018-11-19 03:41:00 Well Zeihan technically in his book that US will have a chance of regional oil independence (sourcing it’s oil from Western Hemisphere).
And Western Hemisphere have everything from Orinoco bitumen to West Texas light.
9864 2018-11-19 03:40:56 I will stand on a ladder & beat the breaks off Brandon Ingram. I’d apply some oil to that dry scalp too.
9865 2018-11-19 03:40:53 #11 has moved sideways after the oil mkt halted its decline on rumors of OPEC reuniting political efforts to extend output cut.

9871 2018-11-19 03:40:27 These clowns are exhausting

EVERYTHING we will buy is going to go up

Most things are made with plastic which is oil

Manufacturing requires energy

Goods are transported by energy

Who is going to absorb all of that?

Share holders?

CEOs?


9872 2018-11-19 03:40:25 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
9873 2018-11-19 03:40:24 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

9877 2018-11-19 03:40:09 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
9878 2018-11-19 03:40:09 Said it since last season and stick by it, complete BS for McLellan to be canned and Chiarelli stay on but don't see them doing both. Agree on the interim route and unless they can ink Quenneville, which won't happen at this time,
9879 2018-11-19 03:40:00 It’s not the forged internals, it’s the extra boost on those forged internals forcing oil by the rings. 
9880 2018-11-19 03:39:55 @NeNeLeakes Nene, Toni Braxton told you about the tree. Research Black Seed oil on You Tube and Cummins seed. juciein raw vegetables. Research. I will not say the C word. I up left you guys in the name of Jesus.The power is in the tongue.Never question God.He said I amI am God.
9881 2018-11-19 03:39:38 we all know when The Donald tweets, Mitch Mcconnell prays for help #resist
9882 2018-11-19 03:39:34 4 minutes left and Rogers Place starting to empty. Oilers fans deserve better after years of unwavering loyalty and patience. I believe Leafs would still be stuck in same situation if Shanny hadn’t come to right the ship. Oil need complete mgmt overhaul, no half assed shit
9883 2018-11-19 03:39:30 Castor Oil restored my feet. Omg 
9884 2018-11-19 03:39:25 There’s many things the coaching staff does that I question. But tonight, as an example 18 giveaways for the Oil, 7 for Vegas. 3 goals against were the result of a giveaways Missed assignments, in D zoneI get your point, don’t know change is needed
9885 2018-11-19 03:39:24 タバコ吸わないけど喫煙所誰も来ないからそこで落ち着いてる
9886 2018-11-19 03:39:20 People really be out here tryna finesse $50 for a oil change when i can go to express and firestone and get it for $30 yeah right
9887 2018-11-19 03:39:17 Depends on how you drive it and the temps. 10w40 is a bit hard on super cold startups but you won’t burn as much oil.
9888 2018-11-19 03:39:11 It’s a shame I can only like this once! I dropped my phone I was laughing so hard!!
9889 2018-11-19 03:39:00 Incredible. Global Magnitsky obviously needed. Good to see FCPA enforcement by DOJ. Glencore helped bail Putin out on the Rosneft privatization deal. Igor Sechin paid Glencore with oil to get them into  deal to give Putin cover after Trump couldn't get sanctions lifted.
9890 2018-11-19 03:38:42 … it's just that you haven't said what you would do to deal with it - cut family programs? Cut fat like Doug Ford? How will you deal with low energy prices? Do you have a plan for climate change AND getting oil to market?
9891 2018-11-19 03:38:19 Make your own. Coconut oil, honey and lemon juice. @IHaveDragons gave me the recipe when I had a cough. 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, 1/4 cup raw honey, 2 tablespoons coconut oil. Really works! Eucalyptus will help open your nose. 
Super sorry you're not feeling well. {{hugs}}
9892 2018-11-19 03:38:10 For starters, the only reason people extract honey oil is to get extra value out of the waste product (leaves and trim).  Why would you bother cooking legal  when you can buy dried 30-35% THC bud already? This is something that you’ll find growers (illegal) doing, not home users.
9893 2018-11-19 03:37:44 I just used argan oil on my face before my moisturizer, let’s cross our fingers and how for the best cause I’m winging it here

9900 2018-11-19 03:36:55 You think I lost to a squirrel? Heck no. We spread olive oil on the pole the squirrel had to climb. He would slide down every day not getting to the feeder.
9901 2018-11-19 03:36:53 We are all a little better with Moroccan Argan oil.
9902 2018-11-19 03:36:46 Right. I bet Q can’t wait to get to Edmonton.
9903 2018-11-19 03:36:44 Their denial machine still prevents there being a civic consensus that would allow nonpartisan movement on keeping oil in the ground.
9904 2018-11-19 03:36:25 If you have cocoa powder, coconut oil, and peanut butter.... fat bombs, just saying!
9905 2018-11-19 03:36:18 These aren't non-hyphenated people, they are French-Canadians.  You know, the folks that pour shit into their rivers and then complain about Alberta oil crossing their province inside a pipe?
9906 2018-11-19 03:36:06 Because I am old I must take my fish oil pill and go to bed. Good night gentlemen of the long spoon.

OIL (To consider buyback)
9908 2018-11-19 03:35:30 Adding up the numbers for 2014, China got 66% of its oil imports that had to go by sea. I'm guessing the numbers have changed since 2014, but not by a big percentage.
9909 2018-11-19 03:35:19 Chia needs to go asap..he can not be allowed to make another trade
9910 2018-11-19 03:35:12 I prefer interim stuff in-season. I'd do the GM that way as well. Then take the time to get the right people in the offseason or shortly before.

9921 2018-11-19 03:34:18 This is one of my favorite tweets.  I'd gladly pay a non-asshole tax to get a decent human in office.  Also, why are people still stoked about oil and coal? If we go that route, so what, your gas will be 4 cents cheaper a gallon if we stick w fossil fuels? Makes no sense to me.
9922 2018-11-19 03:34:17 I was vaping but it made me sick. I believe it might have been chemicals in the oil. I don't know for sure but tincture is what I will try next.

9924 2018-11-19 03:33:59 IF W and the GOP had any concern about 9/11 we wouldn't have had to wait for Obama to take care of it. They were too busy making up other places to start their wars for oil and cash.

9928 2018-11-19 03:33:28 Unless the Oilers take the easy way out & do it when they're on the road, can't see McLellan not being given the boot tomorrow. Unless they convince Q to come immediately, Gulutzan gets the opportunity to audition for a head coaching gig in 19-20 but it won't be in Edmonton.

9932 2018-11-19 03:32:54 actually on second thought it's probably pretty good that they won't let me burn things, considering that not only do I have oil paint, but also tons of bottles of extremely flammable chemicals that have HUGE warnings on them
9933 2018-11-19 03:32:53 Roster is not that bad, just need a coach who can coach them. Experiment done.
9934 2018-11-19 03:32:25 It’s the lobbyists. Lobbyists pay politicians. Whether it’s the NRA, drug companies, healthcare industry, gas and oil, coal, etc. We only pay our government officials, maybe 2 hundred thou a year. And all of them are millionaires. Ask yourself, why is that?
9935 2018-11-19 03:32:20 So many oil companies! I remember the old Hilton in the background but don’t remember the Richfield building at all. Do you know what year this is?
9936 2018-11-19 03:32:20 I think players were fighting for their jobs and after Bouchard got sent down it changed the team.

9952 2018-11-19 03:30:26 eating less meat is more like telling people to get out of the burning house. Necessary, critical, but not sufficient. The message shld be 'eat local and regenag'.

You're welcome.
9958 2018-11-19 03:29:47 Why are the usa and russia do not desire the increase in oil price in global markets as they are the biggest oil exporter?
9959 2018-11-19 03:29:38 #jetairways is falling Knife @RNTata2000 should stay away from this. Aviation make money only in oil countries.
It is cash burning business
9960 2018-11-19 03:29:29 I thought the 2 men thing was funny.   Pity North Korea doesn’t have oil then it could have been 2 and a half men

9962 2018-11-19 03:29:16 You talking about the puppy. Have you watched the one where he fries them in oil?
9963 2018-11-19 03:28:52 Ion feel right tryna talk to niggas and I can’t even get my damn oil changed. Let me get right :(
9964 2018-11-19 03:28:44 Barda? Right! Barda!! Wait...

[Sniff’s his own garment to see if the odor is all she’s making it out to be. 

Her claims prove to be substantiated.] 

I guess my nose is immune to me reeking. Since you’re the summertime sleuth in the family, should I just do baby oil instead?
9965 2018-11-19 03:28:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!

9968 2018-11-19 03:28:14 @westernandrose evening. First time customer; what scent would you recommend for the dry body oil and body cream? Might be hard; from all the customer tweets, it looks like everything smells good. Thx.
9969 2018-11-19 03:28:09 I mean, Chavez mismanaged the national oil company and that contributed to the problems, but do you believe that capitalist company’s are never mismanaged to the point of economic disaster?

Because you should open a history book to 2007.
9970 2018-11-19 03:27:56 I'm using a liter of Caster Oil and skipping desert.

9976 2018-11-19 03:27:27 It wouldn't necessarily respond to the oil. If the skin area is completely intact, the oil wouldn't be in contact with the 2nd layer of your skin. Just keep an eye on it. Actually, keep it away from your eye. All you can do for now is observe it. I hope it fades to nothing.
9977 2018-11-19 03:27:06 #jaitelysintelligence he comes out with new jargon. Non oil tax to GDP ratio. For all the wrong decisions of the govt he has a new jargon.

9982 2018-11-19 03:26:17 This was when prozac was fairly new and the anti Big Pharma thing wasn't a thing -- I'm sure he now preaches that same snake oil. Also, he rewrote the Bible and considered George Washington the second coming of Jesus so I do not get how this lunatic is rich
9983 2018-11-19 03:26:12 Back off on the oil and pipeline talk Trudedumb is busy focusing on the postal dispute.

9987 2018-11-19 03:25:40 I used vegetable oil and it calmed down a lot but before that, it burned so bad I was about to go to the ER. I thought I really fucked up my skin 
9988 2018-11-19 03:25:36 Florida is so beautiful I live in Alaska and we had the worst oil spill in history 1989 takes a lot of $$ and a lot of time but I am sure Scott will do more as your US Senator then Nelson even thought of he was Too busy looking after himself!

9992 2018-11-19 03:24:55 Important point that there’s no path past a limited emissions cut this way. Also, EV adoption leads to cheaper batteries, then grid storage for renewables, then BEV buses and trucks. even a 5% drop in oil demand might wreak havoc on the oil industry.
9993 2018-11-19 03:24:48 They knew that’s what them ppl were using and still went! Smh RT @ThatDamnTwerk1: Somebody said they put motor oil in her ass mannn them people need to go to jaiiillll
9994 2018-11-19 03:24:47 Until we have something other than Saudi oil backing our dollar, no president will cut ties with SA.  
At least now, we're working toward energy independence, but the petrodollar makes us a slave state to the house of Saud. 
Bring back the gold standard? 
9995 2018-11-19 03:24:44 Pickup some Italian superfine Anna Napoletana Tipo"00 flour

Good Luck.
9996 2018-11-19 03:24:37 Went to an arts festival in Wickenburg, AZ where we listened to jazz and bought essential oil diffusers that are also necklaces. I think we’re at peak hippie levels.
9997 2018-11-19 03:24:37 Blatantly false statement.  US oil companies production is not dictated by the President.

10003 2018-11-19 03:24:11 So riddle me this snake oil salespeep,  Who would these purported 'climate polluters' pay up to and to what degree? Once you have pulled that answer out of thin air, explain what you or anyone else would do with the 'pay up'. Lastly, who on earth made you the climate police?
10004 2018-11-19 03:24:06 Mix in ten scoops of olive oil and lower the temperature.

10006 2018-11-19 03:23:51 Any oil that is liquid at room temperature is a good fat. Of course processing, hydrogenation and additives affect that but this is the general rule.

10011 2018-11-19 03:23:28 Our oil price sucks cause liberals killed the pipelines.   Harper took Canada thru deep recession and balanced budget after.   Right now we should have a surplus.
