14 2018-04-05 23:55:51 Ok so Trump threatens tariffs, China responds in kind , stocks plunge. Rebound occurs because they believe negotiating will occur and Trump can't be that reckless or clueless. A day later Trump announces he'd prefer 100 billion in tariffs. Why expect something sane? #TradeWar
15 2018-04-05 23:55:20 Trump just loves taking down stocks with these tariffs

38 2018-04-05 23:53:49 Who cares about fair and square?  And only 20 percent of the population who own 80 percent of Wall Street care about your damn stocks.  Let’s care about
39 2018-04-05 23:52:41 DT’s new Financial Advisor, Kudlow, just calmed the markets by suggesting the tariffs won’t happen—they’re only bargaining tools, 
and now @POTUS calls for ANOTHER $100 Billion in Chinese tariffs! 
Stocks will plummet. 401Ks will sink. #TRUMP has lost touch w/reality.
40 2018-04-05 23:52:22 $alna $plse had nice moves recently, going to keep trying to find these before they happen. Hard to follow 500 stocks though,
41 2018-04-05 23:51:13 US stocks down @400 points after hours after Trump threatens new $100billion tariffs on China.
42 2018-04-05 23:49:57 #Stocks,#Indexes SPX, NDX bottom signals possible tomorrow. Completion would be around 1300.
43 2018-04-05 23:49:51 @edsgotmymoney podcast can increase your knowledge of stock trading #stocks
44 2018-04-05 23:49:13 Sell all your stocks, get more gold!
45 2018-04-05 23:49:04 So you know the drill, sell your over-priced stocks and then buy the next dip. Rinse & repeat.
46 2018-04-05 23:48:59 Rest is over.  Just announced tariff news could easily send $SPX to test or breach the recent lows SPX 2532. If you have low valuation stocks/sectors, it shouldn't be too painful.
47 2018-04-05 23:48:36 Music is elevated from sicc stocks !!

49 2018-04-05 23:46:51 @RyanTrader83 what kind of trading are you doing?  Stocks... Options?
50 2018-04-05 23:46:32 2018 MORON Strategy:  Buy protection AH when news hits, then sell next day when they realize they fucked up, then panic buy the stocks they sold, then panic sell the next day when those same stocks fall back 5-8%.  Rinse repeat.  

That’s basically what’s happening and it’s a sad
51 2018-04-05 23:46:32 This morning I read a @business article that describes speculative short positions in stocks as "investments", and my brain is still bleeding. #ama
52 2018-04-05 23:46:04 This is the time to fix trading abuses w/China (when market/econ is healthy) & it will come w/a market adjustment. So this NEW tariff news could send $SPX to test or breach the recent lows SPX 2532 (good call). If you have low valuation stocks/sectors, it shouldn't be too painful
53 2018-04-05 23:44:34 lol right. They were bulls again tonight. But new tariff news could easily send $SPX to test or breach the recent lows SPX 2532. If you have low valuation stocks/sectors, it shouldn't be too painful.
54 2018-04-05 23:44:01 Every lying comments trump made about trade the stock exchange will crash everyone will loose money you don't have to take my word for it just watch the stocks you can blame it on trump stupid behavior and his stupidity ideas what a joke
55 2018-04-05 23:42:58 How do you short stocks again? #TradeWar @buffalopundit
56 2018-04-05 23:42:38 YouTube didn’t just ban videos which told you how to “make a gun,” or sell bump stocks.  You’re being intentionally obtuse right now.  The NRA neither asks for mass shootings nor promotes violent behavior outside of sport shooting or self defense.
57 2018-04-05 23:42:18 They really need to ban those semi auto knives and knives with bump stocks.
58 2018-04-05 23:41:46 What kind of nominal and notional stops do you use in stocks?
59 2018-04-05 23:41:20 This is the time to fix trading abuses with China and it will come with a market adjustment. So this tariff news could easily send $SPX to test or breach the recent lows SPX 2532. If you have low valuation stocks/sector, it shouldn't be too painful.
60 2018-04-05 23:40:55 The smart investors are buying up any and all stocks that take a tumble during Trump's orchestrated trade war because those investors know this won't last long, and the fundamentals of those companies have not changed, and when the war ends, stock in those companies will soar.
61 2018-04-05 23:40:55 Shaw and Partners updates on Blue Sky $BLA: market punishment excessive, but risk profile nevertheless high. Buyers should prepare for long drawn out battle with shorts. Buy. High Risk. Target $14.20 #ausbiz #XJO #investing #equities #stocks
62 2018-04-05 23:38:38 Oil stocks are dirt cheap and  #FANG is done.  Got to be somewhere.
63 2018-04-05 23:37:50 No, his ham-fisted point was equating banning certain videos that show you how to build guns or link to sites selling bump stocks with PETA.
64 2018-04-05 23:37:15 I see...i see some big stocks down after
65 2018-04-05 23:37:05 Oh my good god thats it. Thats exactly what I want akncsmcknfdmck I gotta go find iiit . Idk if we have a rubi but i think the main cotton on store stocks their stuff (being the parent company and all lol)
66 2018-04-05 23:37:01 So dangerous to own stocks right now with this Trump character
67 2018-04-05 23:36:45 bring on the cannabis stocks!!!!!!!
68 2018-04-05 23:35:30 Think about what pushed the stock price that high in past decade. The everyday headlines? No. It was the low interest rate and QE. So don't blame the president made big news. It's just time for him to do all those things and time for stocks get a correction.
69 2018-04-05 23:34:52 Aye. I need to learn about these stocks. Who jumping? I got some play pay
70 2018-04-05 23:34:39 Regular people.

Not Wall Street types or professional traders.

And for the record, I'm not telling anyone to sell their stocks and hide. I'm no expert.

But maybe talk to someone about hedging your bets... Just in case.
71 2018-04-05 23:33:55 Hmm.. Wonder if his friends are shorting stocks? Wonder if he tells people he's going to make a comment about companies like. Amazon! Whatcha doin there @realDonaldTrump.

72 2018-04-05 23:32:59 THIS IS MY FAVORITE SPARKLING WATER OF ALL TIME. I find it legitimately offensive that no one stocks it in 6-packs and I instead have to only buy liters.
73 2018-04-05 23:32:50 Like @smartertrader says, stocks go up they go down, expect them to go to zero. I got 4 positions that will go to zero, hedged it will cover and then pay some. We had killer day already so staying flat means nothing after today.
74 2018-04-05 23:32:46 Is trump and his buddies shorting stocks or something? Is that the point of this denial of reality and exercise in destructive economics? Do #gop members and trump's businesses and cronies receive some massive monetary gain by pulling this?
75 2018-04-05 23:32:34 Looking at any possible loss in the avgs Fri as another opp to see who the true leaders may be #stocks
76 2018-04-05 23:31:43 Finna get into these stocks 
77 2018-04-05 23:31:34  They may WISH they don’t own stocks if this goes on for awhile!  It will not be pretty, that’s for sure.
78 2018-04-05 23:31:06 Thanks, very smart move, additional cheap purchases.  So many of my stocks are crappy but I end of making money buying on the way down with the belief they will become less crappy.
79 2018-04-05 23:30:39 Would you please pass this on to Cavuto. He seems to push the trade war scheme, perhaps for ratings. Soon as he start pushing it the stocks gains are cut in half.
80 2018-04-05 23:30:29 Buy stocks.

82 2018-04-05 23:29:18 The markets are fine they go up and down naturally that's just stocks as far as Trump we're all still 25 28% ahead of where we were when Obama left things will even out a lil but once this trade stuff is a lil more even we'll all be better off for it. CNBC hates Trump.
83 2018-04-05 23:28:20 Can’t wait for stocks to take a nose dive tomorrow

86 2018-04-05 23:27:40 Please investigate what stocks Trump Inc. is buying and selling now.
87 2018-04-05 23:27:17 Placed in stocks on the driving range ?
88 2018-04-05 23:27:15 Sadly, stocks are going lower
89 2018-04-05 23:27:12 Market finished green across the board all my stocks are up except for snap chat whixh is crazy cuz all you people are hopelessly addicted they really need to release that update
90 2018-04-05 23:27:08 My prediction. Trump wants stocks down so when he gets out of office he goes all in.
91 2018-04-05 23:26:51 Breaking News! Stocks in @CotswoldOutdoor plummet as soon as @ChrisGPackham gets involved  cut ties with this clown and you may regain some of your clientele! #getrid #saveyourselves #banpackham #country #countryside @CAupdates
92 2018-04-05 23:26:32 Do better at picking stocks and stop worrying about politics ...such a buster
93 2018-04-05 23:26:20 TheBull even if the $FRFS ended lower today with $500k traded is not to bad, the reason is. If there was 500k buys moving forward with her volatility we would hit a new high. Less than 50MM shares available to the public. Shares are so scarce that it takes 30 sec for a fill.
94 2018-04-05 23:25:59 Did he say stocks should go lower?   lol
95 2018-04-05 23:25:56 the cynical among us could presume that knowing when the stock market is expected to go up or down could increase profits when trading stocks short-term
96 2018-04-05 23:23:40 Trump government planning on another $100 billion in tariffs against China (in addition to the current $50 billion) Soybean farms are being treated as cannon fodder and acceptable loss.

98 2018-04-05 23:23:13 Sell your stocks
99 2018-04-05 23:23:10 Why does everyone think gold goes down during deflation? Look at Kondratieff's work. During the great depression gold stocks were soaring.

102 2018-04-05 23:20:40 new topic, I feel like 45's stupid tariff war is to create buy points for his wealthy friends so they can pick up all the overpriced stocks after the market collapses y/y?
103 2018-04-05 23:20:19 He’s a “socialist” except when it comes to paying his fair share of taxes. He pays a 13% tax rate on income that puts him in a 28% tax rate. How did he manage that? By hiding wealth in property and stocks which get taxed at a lower rate. He is a “I got mine, screw you” socialist

111 2018-04-05 23:15:10 Watching to see when the mkt begins ignoring Trump's inflammatory comments on tariffs/trade. Will this be an example of more bark than bite? There is good chance of avoiding trade war since Trump doesn't want to be seen as causing bear mkt #stocks

Imo there is no way this trading hault is purely to do with a price query, in my fairly short time of trading I've seen some stocks absolutely rocket off the back of no news.. 

$AVZ only moved 8% ... anyone else?

122 2018-04-05 23:09:25 u're telling me. since trading the mid / high caps i can tell that doesn't really happen. these stocks aren't so prone to manipulation like #pennystocks are, and they tend to follow the $SPY too. have u started trading mid / high caps?
123 2018-04-05 23:09:06 Trump couldn't wait till my trade's expiry before ramping up his bloody trade war ....with stocks bleeding now all these people will pile into $XAU And be giving us wahala
124 2018-04-05 23:08:47 .@CalPERS … “Constructive engagement” only works when backed up by the threat of #divestment. We urge you to support the initiative from @CalTreasurer to #divest from companies that make and sell bump stocks
125 2018-04-05 23:08:14 #ibb #xbi #stocks if somehow the market doesn't tank tomorrow, I guess the bots will finally figure how "this is just a negotiation ploy" what a mess this has become with the ordinary folks being used as punching bags.
126 2018-04-05 23:08:06  brazilian stocks tomorrow will melt down 
127 2018-04-05 23:08:02 There’s only one problem, my good friend - Trump voters don’t own stocks ;)


128 2018-04-05 23:07:47 And rather than generating new jobs a record number of companies are using their tax cuts to buy back their own stocks to generate higher comp for management
129 2018-04-05 23:07:02 Are penny stocks offered?
130 2018-04-05 23:06:54 + short Boeing & Amazon??

it's easy to make money when your words have predictable effects on particular stocks, your big donors (mercers) are stock mkt experts, and SEC is afraid of you...
131 2018-04-05 23:05:58 so what's the deal with stocks always rising and then falling... (pausing for comedic effect) i mean are they stocks or trump staff appointees?? 
132 2018-04-05 23:05:51 $BPMC & $LOXO both up sharply yesterday & down sharply today. Nothing has changed in their prospects or valuation. What's the lesson? Short-term moves in bio completely unpredictable or even irrational. Just buy good stocks on weakness & hold for a long time & you will do well.
133 2018-04-05 23:05:44 Stocks down 1.5% on more tariff news which means we should be up 2.5% tomorrow according to these schizophrenic markets
134 2018-04-05 23:04:41 My $40.00 take-home pay rise has been wiped out by the plunge in Amazon stocks. Anybody else?  Worst President and Cabinet ever.
135 2018-04-05 23:04:08 with a wave of a pen trump has stopped bump stocks.   courts cant actually over rule congress unless its specifically unconstitutional.  I hate to say it but with the right judges and wording allowing for you to buy a gun for $100,000 they would rule its not a ban.

137 2018-04-05 23:03:09 Tax cuts. Regulations. Border security. Trade. NAFTA is being renegotiated. Work programs. Record employment for all races. Stocks are high. Erasing parts of Obama care. Strengthening our military....
138 2018-04-05 23:03:05 I don’t short stocks. I know this garbage could run back to $10 on massive short covering. But if it did, the losers running $HMNY would do another stock offering that same day. And you know that ! I seriously believe this is headed to $1 or less.
139 2018-04-05 23:02:28 Breaking: Trump threatens China with $100bn more in tariffs as a response to Beijing’s ‘unfair retaliation. 

Trump is totally right when he says that the Globalists only want to enrich themselves - by owning stocks in multinational companies who produce everything in China .

155 2018-04-05 22:52:25 As I said: "The #Fed has only reduced its balance sheet by $7bln since Feb 28." Lee Adler, Jim Rickards, Brandon Smith stated they had to play catch up in Feb, hence the drop in stocks. So I'll have to check those numbers and revert.
156 2018-04-05 22:52:05 Months ago, he would not have got a job. Years ago, he'd be in the stocks and would've been pelted with rotten fruit. Deservedly for such an abominable specimen

159 2018-04-05 22:49:05 I don’t think a typical Trump supporter is smart enough to own stocks, so I don’t think they care what the market does.  But Trumps rich Russian buddies will tear him a new a**hole.
160 2018-04-05 22:45:52 Lol as if anybody actually in 'grass roots' can afford stocks anyways.
161 2018-04-05 22:45:42 yeah in this case the main state drug chemist was a maniac who turned in positives for everyone and took the test stocks to go get jacked up for years. so everything is getting tossed in giant batches, slowly

165 2018-04-05 22:43:20 The sporadic swings of the market day to day are not a sign of a stable market.  Stocks have been over priced and inflated for a long time now.  It will correct itself.  I’m not going to debate you on how economics and the market work.
166 2018-04-05 22:42:54 Sure glad that I sold all my stocks on that trade war tweet.
167 2018-04-05 22:42:38 If a law violates your rights it is unjust. Therefore you should break that law. For example I support gun owners keeping there bump stocks even though they are banned.

170 2018-04-05 22:40:30 Buy stocks that are $1 each. One day they could be over $1,000.
171 2018-04-05 22:38:33 coz it's alluring! beginners start off with smaller accounts so logically look for cheaper stocks. then u see pump & dump gurus make it look shit easy, until u can't reproduce their results! 
172 2018-04-05 22:38:12 Every time I buy stocks in the UK I'm thinking why I have to pay £12 in commision for a single trade. When you invest £1200 you start with 1% loss! I'm waiting for tokenized securities and fractional ownership #crypto #Tokenization @APompliano

181 2018-04-05 22:25:00 when y’all say y’all can “flip money” i assume you’re talking about stocks & bonds but lmaooo if you think you’re gonna see an ROI anytime soon.

189 2018-04-05 22:22:37 Be careful selling deep ITM calls on stocks like $LFIN (naked, spreads) as there is a good chance that you will be assigned early. You will be stuck with a big short position and will have to pay massive borrow rates

261 2018-04-05 21:32:48 awesome - penny stocks and laundry both have "spin cycles". love it. @StocksToTrade
262 2018-04-05 21:32:44 When say F- securities laws, the sky is apparently the limit!
263 2018-04-05 21:31:58 Hey DaVin! Stash doesn't offer penny stocks! We are only offering an ETF in this industry.
264 2018-04-05 21:31:53 Now at 4X. He clearly mispriced his offering!
265 2018-04-05 21:30:25 I'm not seeing it. I'm seeing my stocks deflate, trade wars with China, waste of money on military parades instead of helping veterans. All I see is failure. America has become the laughing stock of the world. When are you going to do something good?
266 2018-04-05 21:30:20 Panic selling is never a good idea. I admit to being human. That being said, my reasoning was that in large scale market crashes, the smaller indexes see a lot of stocks being delisted etc. figured I’d get my money out of those few for now.
267 2018-04-05 21:28:40 $APC hanging tough above 50 day. Many other leader stocks are still trying to recover.
268 2018-04-05 21:28:38 Well no, these laws in other towns have been upheld. Just like you can declare a county to be dry, you can declare a gun illegal. CT did 5 years ago, now they're working on bump stocks and ghost guns.
269 2018-04-05 21:28:24 Canada Pot Stocks is what you call a classical jack ass. Fuck that guy and his shit. He's guna fall off a cliff one day...
270 2018-04-05 21:27:10 TIL the difference between investible and investable.

Investable: Things you can invest with (i.e. cash)

Investible: Things you can invest in (e.g. stocks)
271 2018-04-05 21:27:07 the guy thats like "DM ME" to a random twitter girl is also really into stocks and is also vegeta is all fitting

273 2018-04-05 21:21:34 Im buying tickets to hawaii or iceland when my stocks vest next month
274 2018-04-05 21:21:20 Israel also puts  stocks and securities cheats and finance scammers like you, in prison. For your sake it is good thing we aren't like Israel, right, Jacob.
275 2018-04-05 21:19:17 To cover Tax cuts that the Middle and Low income will eventually have to pay back...because you paded the pockets of the rich who are...buying back stocks with their winfalls.
276 2018-04-05 21:18:05 So far they’ve showed all stocks since April 2nd. 10 to one they show bitcoin since March 2nd to today.
277 2018-04-05 21:17:45 $MU I have to admit that Cramer was right that the individual investor with limited funds should not buy individual stocks! I bought 1k 49.9
278 2018-04-05 21:17:36 Volatility is high right  now and has been for the last couple of months  in these markets, 
Stocks, Options and Cryptos.
 It's great opportunity to capitalize in this stormy ride.
279 2018-04-05 21:16:30 putain t'as le t shirt palpal quelle chance, les stocks se sont écoulé en 7 minutes en plus, moi j'arrive à chanté un extrait de si facile
280 2018-04-05 21:15:48 Yeah....my stocks are lower than they’ve been in years. Something better change.
281 2018-04-05 21:15:33 Idk why I wasted my time with penny stocks, I am glad a couple of buddies showed me this
282 2018-04-05 21:13:44 stocks
283 2018-04-05 21:13:39 So there's a basket of stocks. We'll check performance on those at the end of the summer. Remind me...
284 2018-04-05 21:12:04 Canaries in coal mine (manifested or work in progress): semiconductor stocks like NVDA, cannabis stocks, cryptocurrencies, Tesla, the list of mini bubbles is long! @LongShortTrader @jimcramer @barronsonline
285 2018-04-05 21:11:46 Not at front of lads minds now but no harm to assess replenishing stocks, get onto tillage guys for maize/ wholecrop etc
286 2018-04-05 21:10:23 Because the stock market has morphed into nothing but a casino or bitcoin. There's no intrinsic value in stocks anymore.
287 2018-04-05 21:10:09 Sorry wow english, what stocks are you going long on right now? Do you have any picks or plays that you'll be holding or see major upside on?
288 2018-04-05 21:09:25 The money is going out in dividends...just like you reported last week. Dividends do not raise salaries, create jobs or cause the company to grow. Just funnels money to people who own stocks.
289 2018-04-05 21:08:59 - I didn’t mess up on my speech
- My stocks went up 35%
- I fixed my computer with the first method I tried

I wish I was this lucky every day 
290 2018-04-05 21:08:28 The wish list is mind boggling. Buy Defense Stocks
291 2018-04-05 21:08:12 Hilarious!! Someone should be setting some rules for President who so blatantly comments on individual companies and has such a dramatic effect on stocks.
292 2018-04-05 21:08:08 @TradeWithNinja So I’ve been googling brokers reading about which one is better. I have Fidelity and they will not allow me to purchase some OTC stocks. Example $GRCU this morning. Wondering if you know a good #broker thanks!
293 2018-04-05 21:07:56 Less scrupulous investors don't care about the morality of their investments, they care about the cash flows the gun industry generates. If others divest and therefore depress the price of gun industry stocks, you're simply creating a market opportunity for people who don't care
294 2018-04-05 21:07:39 Thanks. It's Elliott Wave Theory's Grand Supercycle. Depending on how you look at it, it either started in 1722 (end of Mississippi Bubble bear market) or 1789, when stocks really started to take off again. So far, I just look at the Super Cycle degrees. 1835-1929-1994-2021
295 2018-04-05 21:07:08 how about you do stocks on ur phone while stripping
296 2018-04-05 21:06:29 Fun to watch all the experts on TV wax on about why stocks are UP or DOWN.  Bottom line, nobody really knows but the best advice is “Don’t Panic & Always Think Long Term.” #stockmarkets

298 2018-04-05 21:04:10 Why is my 401k and stocks going down,down, last month you and trump,Jr were bragging about how well it was doing because of you.  So, I only have you to blame for it going down.  I am not winning!!!!!

320 2018-04-05 20:57:20 I came across all 3 stocks sometime ago thanks to @Zubairssss i think he found them thru you so thanks. Been holding MTFB what seems like years lol
321 2018-04-05 20:56:36 $LULU $NKE $GES $RL $EXPR Retail stocks seem to be the saving grace for this market
322 2018-04-05 20:54:46 Bus stocks predicted to go through the roof.
323 2018-04-05 20:54:27 It was not the magazine I don’t think. It was bump stocks that enable other guns to fire off so many rounds without reloading and guns that are used in the military that fire rounds off like a machine gun
324 2018-04-05 20:54:21 shouldn't it be illegal for him to speak out against companies? He is not allowed to endorse them as not to show favoritism (stock rise) - why is not the opposite true? (Stocks fall).  How do we know his distant aunt or friend does not own stocks in a competitor?
325 2018-04-05 20:52:04 Jacob are u f’ing delusional? People are losing money in houses with increased interest rate and losing tax deductions for the limited interest they can deduct. You stupid dumb douchebag, people losing money in stocks as a result of stupid Tariff war by President bone spur.
326 2018-04-05 20:50:45 It just seems any wide gap in yields between assets results in capital flowing to higher yielding asset, closing the gap. Late 90s: bonds were bargain relative to stocks, 2009-2012: stocks were a bargain.
327 2018-04-05 20:50:20 Compare to the Obama Economy, when outside investors WANTED to buy stocks of America companies.

This is why I made a fortune short selling companies and markets run by #Conservatives.

It hasn't hit bottom yet, everyone can get rich betting against #Trumponomics.

329 2018-04-05 20:50:09 Nice solid day for Canadian resource stocks today...good news from NAFTA bringing money in. Took some profits as I’m not 100% sure we are out of the woods but things are looking promising that we have bottomed for the medium term.
330 2018-04-05 20:49:37 The fact that gold stocks and silver rallied today despite a fairly large drop in gold bullion COULD be signalling a major turn in the PM sector.
331 2018-04-05 20:47:35 Stocks declining, wages stagnant, great time for a trade war, right?
332 2018-04-05 20:47:30 I don’t follow the analyist. I invest in sound companies in good sectors. I wait for the market to catch up on the growth stocks while I buy them low and keep my foot in with the legacy ones when the price is right and they look like they going somewhere new.
333 2018-04-05 20:47:26 The taxpayer funded stock buybacks ended up crashing the market, which #Conservatives didn't expect. 

When the only people buying stocks are those corps, that's economic weakness.

Stock buybacks used to be illegal. It's (ineffective) market manipulation.

346 2018-04-05 20:41:45 FWIW comment: coincides with crypto stocks crashing (of course). Anyone can create a "new" crypto currency and make more, but there is a fixed amount of gold & silver in existence. LT bullish $GLD $SLV $GG $PAAS $PVG and a few others

351 2018-04-05 20:39:54 GOP adds billions to debt with their tax cuts so corporations could buy out their own stocks and boost CEO salaries. If they were feeling generous, lower level employees got one time bonus. No wage increases. That doesn’t grow economy. Money sits in hedge funds & offshore banks
352 2018-04-05 20:39:50 R U sure about the information, you need look & check cause the stocks
R not transferring the outlook your reporting the same optimism
353 2018-04-05 20:39:47 I think it's hard cause it's context of the game. rage 0 to deaths would be seen as dope if the game was fundamentally different enough to warrant more stocks. I like how rage changes neutral, but dislike the less creative side to it. I mostly just hate rage ladders tbh
354 2018-04-05 20:39:34 Where's trump to lower these stocks again?

360 2018-04-05 20:37:27 Dividend stocks are good for beginners for the principle. Dividend stocks mean the company is making profits. Plus you can also reinvest them in more shares. Growth stocks in Jamaica progress is really led by the investor mentality of buying and selling ipo offerings for profit.

363 2018-04-05 20:35:51 Obama inherited an economy that was near collapse and brought it back. Most of Trump followers are not fans, they want to see what lies he tweets. Trump’s poll numbers do not support “rallying around him.” The richest 10% own 84% of stocks so avg. citizens do care about it.
364 2018-04-05 20:35:49 The top five stocks that gained today were $NAVI, $MRO, $RRC, $ALB, and $MOS.

368 2018-04-05 20:34:40 This goes back to my earlier comments about false and misleading comments that could have an impact on stocks and someone's character.
369 2018-04-05 20:34:29 Don’t kid yourself or the American workers. Tax cuts benefit the rich elites who are your major donors. Companies use the tax cuts to fund stock buybacks which increase the stock’s value. The richest 1% own 40% of all stocks. Do the math. Rich win again.

372 2018-04-05 20:31:01 my retirement account looks a little smaller, stocks are down. Your plan is a failure.
373 2018-04-05 20:30:32 LIAR!  CEO's are the ones getting 80% of higher wages and obscene bonuses. 
Have you paid ANY attention to jobs lost during your reign of terror? Do you even grasp the bare basics of what your Trade War will do? Did you Short Tech Stocks before you tanked the NASDAQ?  #RESIGN
374 2018-04-05 20:30:15 STOCKS back on the RISE
375 2018-04-05 20:29:38 Plenty of upside in both imo.Also having nice consolidation on FRR so not looking too bad ATM despite very low volumes.
Stay patient if you are happy with choice of stocks and increased liquidity should give great returns
376 2018-04-05 20:29:22 Dow futures went down because of the tariff news. Stocks rose yesterday because of the job report and a softening stance by the administration on tariff escalation. But, yes, get the tweets off.
377 2018-04-05 20:29:11 He should be stripped and put in stocks for rotten tomato throwing IMHO.
378 2018-04-05 20:29:04 Also, you probably want to dig deeper and see if all the tax overhaul benefits are included in that chart, as most of the "big oil" stocks got big tax breaks that pumped up earnings. Depends on how that chartist is defining "profits".
379 2018-04-05 20:28:54 Then, you know that it's a semi-automatic rifle that needs to have the trigger pulled each time it's fired. Regarding bump stocks, if they are banned, someone will figure out a way to improvise an alternative. Bad guys will find a way to skirt the law.
380 2018-04-05 20:26:53 Great day in commodity land despite strong $USD.  Very strong Energy, Metals, Uranium stock performance. even gold stocks were green in down #gold tape.  I don't know the whys I just trade the set ups.
381 2018-04-05 20:26:03 Unless you're an industry being affected by the tariff - and your stocks prices are down.
382 2018-04-05 20:24:42 This is a lie. The companies are "buying back" their own stocks & inflating their values.
383 2018-04-05 20:22:38 Light volume for stocks today. Taking today's rally with a grain of salt until we see what tomorrow's job report brings.
384 2018-04-05 20:22:26 I bought stocks in clear backpack manufacturers.

386 2018-04-05 20:21:40 World stocks roar back: Europe +2.4%; US +.7%. Easing trade-war fears & realization 1Q will be blowout earnings quarter catalyzed world markets for today. No reason to believe downside volatility won't reappear. It will with a vengeance. Still expect solid single-digit 2018 gain.
387 2018-04-05 20:20:09 Whenever tech stocks soar after a rollercoaster ride, someone has to push the Ponzi scheme button.

392 2018-04-05 20:16:46 Trade war fears ease which is boosting Stocks.
393 2018-04-05 20:16:24 In UNSC discussion of UK chemical attack, @franceonu urges Russia to answer UK questions, declare formerly undeclared stocks without delay. These weapons are simply "intolerable" and their "absolute prohibition" must be affirmed. Lapses in regime opens the door to terror uses.
394 2018-04-05 20:16:03 Good point! Thats why we need unified national gun laws. Then ppl can’t just go across state lines, & online sales & gun shows. Where a shooter could get 24 AR style rifles & bump stocks like Vegas. national background checks like Reagan signed w the Brady Bill. God Bless
395 2018-04-05 20:15:06 Nice nice! I've been carrying the July ones for about a month now. The Apr and May are about a week old. One of the stocks I am speculative on for M&A this year. Looking hard at a lot of the smaller cap bios for the same reason.
396 2018-04-05 20:14:46 If someone is going to sit down and teach that family how to identify solid companies and where to find information on company news that would be a great option. But to just tell them go invest in stocks with no reference it won’t turn out well.
397 2018-04-05 20:13:47 Actually, with stocks plummeting due to Trump's personal dumb ass feuds, my 401k could be in jeopardy. #TrumpDerangementSyndrome
398 2018-04-05 20:13:14 buying pot stocks yesterday was buying an emotional reaction, buying them today we will see
399 2018-04-05 20:13:03 I know everyone uses  NFP as the reason this all started but Jan 26 market sentiment uber bullish, cocky and stocks went vertical.Vertical is like Last call for alcohol as u know,late in the move & a hint that borrowed time for this part of move. Ive worked hard for 2.5% YTD lol
400 2018-04-05 20:13:01 And massive loss in stocks
401 2018-04-05 20:12:56 My new stance is that we shouldn't even discuss gun laws - including bump stocks - until the FBI is able to fully interview that mega-sketchy Australian guy who seems to be involved with Paddock, and who FBI management (old McCabe types) seem to be protecting. FAKE DOESN'T COUNT

The fact is there's ways around this kind of thing.

You're not actually this stupid surely??

430 2018-04-05 20:00:02 The NRA response after Sandy Hook in 2012 was almost exactly the same as the response after Parkland in 2018.

447 2018-04-05 19:48:06 I typically make 30-50% on pot stocks on the low end, on larger sustained moves I've made 200-300%

With the discount in $ACB right now, a huge move will happen if a #legalization date is announced soon, it would go to $12 fast, possibly over $15 to a new high

453 2018-04-05 19:45:19 I've never seen USDA be all that interested in correlating its quarterly stocks numbers and ending stocks guesses for any grain/oilseed/etc. 
But maybe that's just me.
454 2018-04-05 19:44:45 Yes, but he has been wrong wrong wrong on timing these events in both gold and stocks for quite a while.  I understand his demographic models, and had it not been for QE, i think this whole thing woulda deflated.  But if gold gets 2 monthly closes above 1366-1388 = Dent wrong IMO
455 2018-04-05 19:44:30 An antedote of the kind developed in Britain - which doesn't keeps stocks the dote it's supposed to ante. Go figure.
456 2018-04-05 19:43:43 Bwoy, all I know from my personal "heart attack" moments is that the only thing that gave me some peace and allowed me leave those stocks alone was the knowledge I had cash otherwise if I had an emergency like medical etc. Can't draw on JMMB on the weekends esp.
457 2018-04-05 19:43:12 I think it’s a bit biased that the ladies footasylum section only stocks shoes sizes 6 and below, everytime I’ve been I’ve had to go to the men’s section. Plus they aren’t the same building either you literally have to walk out and into the men’s next door kmt.
458 2018-04-05 19:43:05 Could be but I think the WASDE right after the stocks report usually responds to the new data. For oats and barley, revisions to ending stocks could be higher by 50% or more. I'm less focused on the big crops. Plenty of smart people already looking at those numbers.

you have no control over stocks when it comes to analyst upgrades (if you're short) and downgrades (when you're long a position).

risky

that's why we only trade futures.

508 2018-04-05 19:17:11 Possible we see these pot stocks start a multi day run if $SPY stays strong
509 2018-04-05 19:16:55 @Morrisons the Morrison's in colindale no longer stocks Mrs balls chutney.  Very sad day. #mrsballschutney
510 2018-04-05 19:16:46 I must have missed that. I heard how in SK and other Asian countries money is earned differently, but I can’t believe that waitering can earn millions of dollars do individuals. I could not fin the tweet where you posted your earnings. I, personally, make money off of stocks.
511 2018-04-05 19:16:44 The biggest, potential risk, to stocks , is the price one pays.   Valuations matter, not all the time, of course, but at the end of the day , they do.  See 1929, 2000.2008
512 2018-04-05 19:16:27 What do you offer other than buying stocks like on every other exchange in the US I sent you guys money three months ago I still cannot trade any crypto currency and I can’t use it on crypto currency on my other exchanges you guys going to act like this from now on are you a scam
513 2018-04-05 19:16:04 Is that an AR15 with bump stocks and is Winnie convicted of domestic abuse? Is he bipolar or manic depressive?
514 2018-04-05 19:15:14 If you found my response high and mighty, then you obviously did not read what I said correctly.  Funny that the @NRA and #2A supporters have zero flexibility for common sense- safety classes, increased background checks, bump stocks, etc.  Safety should be #1 for all parties.
515 2018-04-05 19:15:07 Mid-Day: Stocks are all trading in positive territory, nearly up 1% overall (DOW over 300, thus far); MBS is now up 2bps; and Yields are still at 2.83%.
516 2018-04-05 19:14:57 I can’t imagine watching Trip sapling Villager for 3 stocks. While it’s fun to watch in short spurts 3 stocks just will result in a LOT of timeouts.
517 2018-04-05 19:14:51 Buffett: “if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will still own one ounce at its end.”  Stocks, on the other hand, produce earnings that compound over time.  In the long run, stocks will always win. But 14 years of parity is surprising.
518 2018-04-05 19:13:32 Stocks are up over 300 right now. These crooks are just rooting against America for their own greed!  Give them Hell!
519 2018-04-05 19:12:46 That's a stretch of a definition if I've ever seen one.  They sell stocks don't they? #stockholders call the shots, not the CEO.
520 2018-04-05 19:12:32 Or like, logical age requirements, better background checks, education, mental health or violence restraining orders, ban high capacity magazines, bump stocks, and weapons built the murder as many people as possible as efficiently as possible.
521 2018-04-05 19:12:12 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
522 2018-04-05 19:11:28 . @CalPERS … “Constructive engagement” only works when backed up by the threat of #divestment. Get behind the @CalTreasurer's push to #divest from companies that make and sell bump stocks. #ucemployee #thatsmymoney
523 2018-04-05 19:11:25 Existing laws aren't working, so they need to change. Universal background checks, raising purchasing age to 21, banning bump stocks, automatic rifle ban, classes, testing, proof you know how to use it, separation of gun from ammo, frequent check-up with people who are flagged
524 2018-04-05 19:11:14 Bump stocks should not be legal
525 2018-04-05 19:11:11 You have to buy at least 100 units of most stocks. A $1000 here or there can buy enough?  It would make more sense for them to save some cash first for emergencies then when they get to 50k, they use 20k to start a unit trust or equity account.
526 2018-04-05 19:11:01 .@CalPERS … “Constructive engagement” only works when backed up by the threat of #divestment. We urge you to support the initiative from @CalTreasurer to #divest from companies that make and sell bump stocks
527 2018-04-05 19:10:34 I know there are responsible gun collectors. My deceased husband and I went to gun shows years ago and we bought a Civil War gun at an auction I wanted. He had guns. Not high load though. So they are not saying semi- automatic they are saying bump stocks and high volume
528 2018-04-05 19:10:30 PENNY STOCKS MOMO ALERT: $LXRP - LEXARIA BIOSCIENCE CORP COMMON
529 2018-04-05 19:10:24 Citron shorts a stock, tweets the short, and then buys the stock back.  They know the stock will drop once they tweet the short.  Unethical.  The good news it gives you a good chance to buy the stocks at a better price.
530 2018-04-05 19:09:54 very good analysis on stocks
531 2018-04-05 19:09:34 Does anyone have an explanation for strength in oil stocks?  Is the keystone pipeline back at full capacity?
532 2018-04-05 19:09:06 おれが地軸
533 2018-04-05 19:08:38 Well said and very very true. I think initiating coverage on all these stocks, all at once, now instead of years ago, shows how criminal it really is. I sure hope they investigate this guy and UBS. Sucks when you're fully invested, and don't have the chance to buy in lower.

538 2018-04-05 19:06:03 Here's the way i look at it. If the economy is going to be good then chip stocks are going to be good. Chips are in everything today. Bullshit call knocks down prices so they can get in cheaper. It's criminal. But it will continue you just have to figure out how you want to trade
539 2018-04-05 19:05:06 i want blue chip stocks for christmas

585 2018-04-05 18:45:22 This thinking is whats keeping them poor. no! People with limited income can do the same "high risk" investing as anyone else. There are products that match whatever paycheque level. Stocks especially are open to all and have the lowest buy in cost.
586 2018-04-05 18:45:03 I wouldn't be surprised if he (his trust) bought stocks in @amazon when price dropped. I definitely did!  He's just manipulating the stocks. None of these stocks stay low for long.

638 2018-04-05 18:19:36 So now "multi-round" and "bump stocks" equate to automatic weapons? Your tweets indicate that you're an idiot.

640 2018-04-05 18:18:51 Today I think I’ve realized that I want FANG stocks to be my smallest holding.  I’ll get Facebook at some point, Amazon as well. Currently hold Netflix and it’s my 2nd or 3rd largest at the moment. So I’ll have to buy at least $1500 in Microsoft, AT&T, Fiat, etc.

648 2018-04-05 18:14:39 I'm okay with one shot riffles. But the facts is that most of the time killings are caused by multi-round guns and bump stocks. I find  that when people (like you) have nothing good to say you just curse and rant. This is why america is failing.

658 2018-04-05 18:11:43 Thank you, Mr. R. So much to consider in preparing for the summer. Will stocks that fared better in the current correction also do better in the summer?

665 2018-04-05 18:08:58 The only other advantage of owning dividend paying stocks is the public's misconception that a dividend is the same as interest. They think they're getting paid money that they didn't have before. Nevertheless, that misconception does create more demand for dividend stocks.

671 2018-04-05 18:06:57 The value of a corporation's stocks should be determined by the market - not by the president of the United States. Never before in the history of our country has a president gotten involved in the free exercise of capitalism.

individual mandate is gone-
isreal is capital- obama and every other president promised that and trump actually did it.
stocks soaring-
675 2018-04-05 18:05:13 No they're not actually being enforced yet and won't be for probably a couple of months. What we're seeing now is the panic from people seeking off stocks to put them into something less risky/less profit.

686 2018-04-05 17:59:55 Democrats need to illustrate that post-Round 1, we’ve seen almost nothing but massive stock buybacks. Companies are not passing real savings on to employees. They are buying back stocks.

689 2018-04-05 17:59:32 Shouldn't you be studying international economics and how to operate diplomacy ahead of upcoming summits? I think deliberately working to tank particular stocks is probably gonna bite you in your enormous ass.

734 2018-04-05 17:42:04 Newsflash. A mere 15% overhead dilution on a setup, can increase its gross win rate by a median of 25%. Simply put, Dilution can take a 60-70% win rate setup, all the way to fucking 85-95%. So 2 stocks can have the EXACT same TECHNICAL setup, but vastly diff long term win rates.

742 2018-04-05 17:36:54 I’ve seen this suggestion multiple times and I think it has merit. I would also like to see bump stocks banned, and much much tighter restrictions on assault weapons, it they’re not banned. People want to believe that a ban on 1 weapon is a ban on all—thanks to NRA.

I'd like correction to 2250-2300.
751 2018-04-05 17:31:10 Surprising how deeply attached people get to stocks in their portfolio. And how vehemently traders react when someone has a short bias. Stocks go up and down, there's always money to be made on the long and short side. Time frame / horizon helps define opportunity.

763 2018-04-05 17:27:06 So on Reddit I told -one- person that we need more gun laws than just banning bump stocks. That -one- person than accused me of wanting to take ALL guns, which I never wanted and never will.

Just saying, is all.

794 2018-04-05 17:11:03 Definitely. Time to rotate out of risky stocks/bonds and into safe and stable shitcoins.
795 2018-04-05 17:10:06 How about everyone ban Facebook, let's see the stocks tank!!! Retaliation!!!!!
796 2018-04-05 17:09:34 so if inflation increases commodity prices. so stocks % should be lower. hmmm
797 2018-04-05 17:08:54 Stoploss .. what u detest in % terms on dnside - u shd exit ! Otherwise stocks r already near bottom !
798 2018-04-05 17:08:48 have they built some soy stocks somewhere? they bring steel in US via Mexico and Canada, why not do the same things in reverse? these days nothing surprise me anymore.
799 2018-04-05 17:08:42 Yes, they widen the spread on a lot of stocks to keep them from becoming liquid where volume can come to give us an idea of how it might trade if volume hits it with a tight bid to ask spread. But it was just an example was all.
800 2018-04-05 17:08:00 Any personal finance class will tell you it's a horrible idea to take out a loan to invest in stocks or bonds. It's incredibly risky. What happens if the bond market slumps? Now that $300 million evaporates and we still have the pension issue. Bad idea Brett Lindstrom of Omaha!!!

803 2018-04-05 17:07:18 I hope the Trump supporters are realizing they made a mistake in supporting him coz prices keep going up and I'm sure it's hitting their pockets as well ....pmus the stocks keep going down and it's so volatile;trump is maki g it worse for the economy; going aboit it the wrong way
804 2018-04-05 17:05:59 This also means Mark needs to make money Stateside and in Korea. USA has expiat type taxation on all the money citizens makes outside USA. So he is making the least of everyone, if he doesnt invest money in USA stocks or businesses.
805 2018-04-05 17:04:44 There is no trade war. This is the Trump admin using Trump's "blueprint" for negotiation. Note that all tariffs have "soft deadlines" and US is open to "exceptions". Likelihood of real trade war developing less than 5%. Stocks have figured it out already.
806 2018-04-05 17:04:39 What happens if all emergency services stop carrying the antidote?  If no one stocks it?  How many instances of dozens of recoveries for a single drug user simply because they know where to shoot up?

894 2018-04-05 16:37:57 It is  more likely that Trump and his cronies buy puts or shorts stocks before Trump starts shooting them down for profit.
895 2018-04-05 16:37:39 and lately stocks have begun to pay attention to rising yields... 2.9% on 10-yr is when they start reacting, I feel. Right now, we at 2.83

911 2018-04-05 16:31:37 Again you need to do research the market may fluctuate from day but it’s the highest it’s been in years.  How do I know? I have stocks! Obviously you don’t.  You are giving a opinion you know nothing about. Tax credits for parents increased, more people with jobs
912 2018-04-05 16:30:02 I’m laughing right now because you have no clue about anything you’re saying. “Rapid fire magazines?” Every magazine fires at the same rate. “Assault weapons” are automatic, and automatic weapons have been banned since ‘86. Bump stocks decrease accuracy.
913 2018-04-05 16:29:52 When do you enter/exit? On daily basis? And what is the churn expected? If you can share.. Because you found new stocks and deployment was super quick.. nice...
914 2018-04-05 16:29:44 All I can say abt Kudlow is his positions never change. He still thinks trickle down works. If L. businesses pay more dividends & do more buy backs no $ trickles down 2 lower level employees.Even the $ that may be repatriated will have little effect if it's all used 4 stocks
915 2018-04-05 16:29:38 got quite a few today around 5c and 6c
916 2018-04-05 16:29:27 But when will the stocks go up
917 2018-04-05 16:27:20 Essentially zero focus on what if ylds don’t turnout fine! *BUT* if ylds end up at say 37-38/acre, on now likely revised lowered planted/harvested; we’re on the cusp of an historic 50% drawdown which would leave ending #WHEAT stocks around 550M.

920 2018-04-05 16:25:34 Then your "portfolio" was in some very underperforming stocks. All you needed to do was index to have some pretty nice gains over eight years, even accounting for the flatness (aka, stability) of the last couple.

941 2018-04-05 16:19:48 I believe irrational exuberance caused the 2017 rise in stocks before the administration had even done anything. Effects of Trump policy started in February of this year. I’m bearish.
942 2018-04-05 16:19:08 It is tough work being short stocks.
943 2018-04-05 16:19:01 Many people wouldn’t consider a 50 day hold a day trade ... like I said when you hit the million dollar mark you might wanna ease of a bit but no one can tell you how long you have to hold stocks in your TFSA. Might want to get a job also to prove trading isn’t a business.

1020 2018-04-05 15:52:10 Naa. Just know the stocks your looking at. Had to buy some in all that. CMG SIX GWPH ETC. HD WAS SCREAMING BUY ME. Protect to the downside.
1021 2018-04-05 15:52:02 So we got the retest of the lows, and in some major world indices undercut them, but are now trading higher.

Genuine question, what are some concerns people still have about this market on the long side? What will get you back into buying the market or individual stocks again?
1022 2018-04-05 15:51:59 Actually bump stocks don’t increase accuracy at all. They do however waste alot  of ammo. Just sayin.
1023 2018-04-05 15:51:40 I do not have any stocks but I will not use Amazons. #MAGA
1024 2018-04-05 15:50:04 @realDonaldTrump Many in Congress - GOP that only cares about CEOs & Dems that have become equally corporate, globalist - oppose you on TRADE, using stocks to illustrate their talking points.  Nevertheless TRADE, as-was, is unsustainable! Stocks will rise!
1025 2018-04-05 15:49:43 No they gave @realDonaldTrump $30M campaign donations and he's beholden to them. I grew up with guns, Dad lifelong member of the NRA. NOBODY WANTS TO TAKE WEAPONS like I grew up with, only assault weapons and bump stocks. A shotgun great for home defense. Accuracy not so critical

1031 2018-04-05 15:47:28 A reminder that this tirade against Amazon is for two reasons:
1) Jeff Bezos, unlike Trump, really is a billionaire.
2) Bezos owns a media outlet that isn't Fox.
I'm sure Mueller is already looking into whether Trump or any of his pals are trading stocks based on these tweets.

1052 2018-04-05 15:39:06 Also, if he's using his office to funnel tax dollars into his properties, that's not excused by bigger losses somewhere else. If a bank manger has stock in the bank, and the stocks drop, he can't rob the safe to offset his loss.

1057 2018-04-05 15:38:06 Let me get this right. Corbyn supporters want irrefutable proof that stocks of Russian chemical weapons are buried in a bunker under the Ural Mountains somewhere. Until then the out of control Russian FSB can assassinate anyone they want. #Russia #SalisburyAttack #Novichok
1058 2018-04-05 15:37:32  when “value investors” define themselves as being NOT something most people think is dumb. “We are not mo traders or chartists.”

1100 2018-04-05 15:25:04 I hold high yield bonds, and I don’t think a correlation to stocks makes them unattractive for diversification given the low beta. They still give me the option to rebalance during a stock selloff, and the extra yield more than makes up for the “cost” of the correlation.

1269 2018-04-05 14:25:36 #stocks above the 50DMA and 150 NOT making new lows a few days ago plus $VIX lower highs at $SPY lows a good hint that the face ripper was coming. Getting over 2700 on $SPY will be more difficult, at least on first try

1271 2018-04-05 14:25:21 The tactical bias remains defensive, sensing stocks stability will permit a data driven and Fed fundamental treasuries trade, with yields currently pricing in well less than half of Fed forecasts for 2018 through 2020
• Look for a 2.84% to 2.786% range in 10s

1273 2018-04-05 14:25:04 What if the US/Chinese Trade War narrative only serves the purpose of shaking out weak hands to domestically accumulate more cheap stocks legally.

Negotiation talks will probably lead to previous status quo price-wise.
1274 2018-04-05 14:21:47 But that was done using bump stocks which are now illegal 
If he didn’t have those that number wouldn’t be anywhere close to what it is

1300 2018-04-05 14:17:01 It would be interesting to know if Trump and family had stocks in Amazon. Did they sell and dump right before he made the announcement.......hmmmmm?
1301 2018-04-05 14:16:07 “I don’t want to ban guns, just assault rifles” so you do want to bans guns? 

“Give us an inch and we’ll take a mile”

The bump stocks are an inch, the assault rifles are a foot, and all guns would be a mile.

The only way to take guns without revolt is SLOWLY.

1337 2018-04-05 14:01:26 Metal and mining stocks were in demand as concerns about a trade war  between the world's two largest economies eased after the US and China  signaled room for talks. China is the world's largest consumer of steel,  copper and aluminum. Jindal Steel & Power (up 7.47%),
1338 2018-04-05 14:00:49 The real big question i continue to have is how long can China keep taking monster imports that look like they are all for SPR.  Filling up a little under the equivalent of Cushing each month. In a whole year, they are adding almost the total US's commercial crude stocks.

1399 2018-04-05 13:42:23 Yh. Well, so are grapes and them strawberries. Just grabbed it off the shelf noting the price per kg. Still don’t know how much it (one) costs. I found out Shoprite stocks it last week.  and it was the first time I got to eat it 
1400 2018-04-05 13:42:22 You'll be in jail first because companies aren't thriving, executives and shareholders are. The combination of the #GOPTaxScam and #TrumpTradeWar are going to put manufacturers, farmers and small businesses out of work. Stocks are tanking.  #TrumpCrimeFamily #TrumpColluded
1401 2018-04-05 13:42:21 Entitlement reform is a solid debate. Corporate tax at X rate is meaningless. Corporations aren't creating more jobs, they're exporting them and still selling their products here. Most are buying back stocks and raising leadership salaries.

1403 2018-04-05 13:42:07 I was going to pickup some $GRCU this morning. Dang Fidelity in some pink sheet stocks. Errors out (tc9052). But I did get some $SRMX
1404 2018-04-05 13:41:49 Still don't understand the "rev" part. I have been following it for years with my father. It just took this long for a consensus to form. Im more worried about my stocks.

1.Few thoughtful investors  recognise despite the  prevailing bullishness things won't be Rosey forever.
2. Most investors  realize things are detiorating fast.
3.Everyone is convinced things can only  get worse.

1420 2018-04-05 13:37:20 In addressing the reasons stock prices reacted by more then the economy, Krugman ignores the fact that stocks are options on the values of firms and hence levered plays on the economy. Rookie mistake. Ok - Nobel rookie mistake.

1422 2018-04-05 13:36:47 Stocks opened down yesterday until Trumps commerce sec said he doesn’t expect this to lead to a trade war. You can’t deny the markets loss of confidence.

1424 2018-04-05 13:36:34 Agreed. Default options for accumulation more about long risk vs. growth (and serial as needed). Drawdown introduces many more variables.

1.Few forward looking people begin to believe things will get better.
2.Most investors believe improvement is actually taking place.

1443 2018-04-05 13:31:44 Yes, but let's say half of those stocks have earnings growth of 20%/yr and half have eg of -20%/yr. Eventually, fundamentals will matter and a revaluation will occur (in theory). A strategy overweight the +fundamental stocks will win. Anyway, time horizon assessment wld matter

1445 2018-04-05 13:29:19 That it is great to find other people within the industry - backing the industry. :) Lots of people trading into ASX mineral stocks don't seem to even know what a JORC report is

1447 2018-04-05 13:27:09 Trump has dropped stocks, and interfered with free markets.
1448 2018-04-05 13:25:46 By diversifying amongst asset classes globally, and not just sticking with big cap stocks, you position yourself to earn higher returns.

1988-2017 Growth of $1:
MSCI All Country World Index = $10.19

DFA Equity Balanced Strategy Index = $30.23

1450 2018-04-05 13:25:03 Ignorant. USSR is not same as Russia. The US got formula AND chemist from UZBEKISTAN when they dismantled the laboratory in 1999. There is not the slightest evidence that Russian Federation ever made this stuff, let alone still has any. OPCW certified all RF CW stocks destroyed
1451 2018-04-05 13:24:13 Someone look into Trump buying Amazon stocks, on the low key. His crony capitalist behaviours is coming out again
1452 2018-04-05 13:24:04 Great job starting a trade war and wiping out the markets. I guess I should thank you, I knew something idiotic would happen, like this, so I trimmed and bought bear stocks. I'm having steak and lobster on you tonight!
1453 2018-04-05 13:21:33 If we ever needed proof how incompetent Trump is the stock market is the proof.He is attacking out corp causing stocks 2 tank.Tariffs stock tank.

1455 2018-04-05 13:21:23 Stocks tanked because of your trade tweets and penalties. Marauding caravan from Mexico heading to our border  was really refugees going to Mexico. National Guard sent to border because of drugs, but still crossings at a low.  You can't keep track of delusions!
1456 2018-04-05 13:21:19 No worries. They could be traded as sympathy plays. In other words if something good or bad happens to $XON have a look at what’s happening to $ZIOP. Other pairs I look at albeit competitors are $ALNY and $IONS, “obesity stocks” $ARNA $VVUS $OREX now $OREXQ, $PLUG & $FCEL etc

1468 2018-04-05 13:17:58 And the scary thing for me is that if you have enough market equity you can short stocks, so the rich will make money one way or the other, even if there’s an actual crash and the rest of us are destroyed. It’s sad, and sickening. They don’t care what happens.

1472 2018-04-05 13:16:31 Major reason for Einhorn's underperformance past several years has been his insistence on shorting the best growth stocks due to "valuation"- references to his bubble basket go back to at least 2014- have always liked him but at some point you have to admit defeat...
1473 2018-04-05 13:16:11 Staying the course amid volatility and short-term losses is essential to earning the significant premium on stocks over bonds.

1525 2018-04-05 12:51:55 @FXS_Stocks_RU thanks for following me 
1526 2018-04-05 12:51:26 Our nation’s top economic advisor just said ‘at the end of the rainbow, there’s a pot of gold’ -the increased tariffs just announced are actually a method of lowering trade barriers- and everyone was like, oh okay, everything’s fine, let’s buy stocks again. Words have such power.
1527 2018-04-05 12:50:58 Stocks are bid again this morning on any number of reasons..I’m going with strong economic fundamentals making valuations very attractive after a totally speculative sell off reason...
1528 2018-04-05 12:49:33 U.S. stocks are on track to have their worst April start since 1929, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 index slumped 2.4 percent as of 1:10 p.m. in New York, a rout exceeded only by its 2.5 percent decline 89 years ago, a prelude to the Great Depression.
1529 2018-04-05 12:47:44 We try to ignore Trump..but he hurts people in so many ways..my 401K was hurt, the USPS was disrespected, Amazon was hurt, other stocks hurt..all because his ego was bruised.
Learn this- Trump is a vindictive, bully- child, immature and unthinking.

1531 2018-04-05 12:46:21 yes Ralph it's called manipulation. All the CB's do it. So you trot out Bullard who says 'no more hikes', you buy the most shorted stocks, algos catch fire. Pesto your 'most impressive day'.

1556 2018-04-05 12:34:10 Many assume that the ledgers are run by each company - we trust them anyway, so why not trust them to tell us how many shares we have.

1560 2018-04-05 12:33:17 Agreed  

Although some argue about dividends, reinvesting them (as well as buying at regular intervals) provides solace, too.

When stocks do finally bounce, those who bought and re-invested through the down patch will hit new highs before broader markets 

1561 2018-04-05 12:33:14 I guess it would depend on what you are trying to achieve. If you could buy a portfolio that delivered 2x beta w/o direct financial leverage, it could be an interesting instrument. ie buy high beta stocks. The problem is their exp returns suck

1567 2018-04-05 12:29:16 This might be a dumb question but if we went back to say 1500 I assume that both cod stocks and seal populations were MUCH higher than either is at present. So - how can it be that seal predation is the decisive factor in our declining cod numbers?
1568 2018-04-05 12:28:08 It's hard dealing with weight gain, but it's harder when clothes no longer fit and what's devastating about it is when you try to buy the same thing in bigger sizes, stocks are no longer available.
1569 2018-04-05 12:28:00 Finding winning stocks that outperform the indices is a difficult process that often feels like finding a needle in a haystack. We need every possible edge available and simply analyzing individual stocks won't get the job done.

1591 2018-04-05 12:15:58 That's a dangerous path to walk down my dude. With this logic, if a bank was to invest in stocks, and lose my life savings, (like what happened in the UK a few years back) it would justify, if only partially, for me to go to my bank and start shooting up the place.

1632 2018-04-05 11:54:02 I was bearish #USD for quite some time. But we've seen lately that developed markets' stocks can't handle weak #dollar. They need their local currencies to depreciate against USD.

1633 2018-04-05 11:53:56 You don't seem to know the difference between investing in stocks and bonds, and speculating on the forex market.

1634 2018-04-05 11:53:36 hello, I guess there are two possible reasons why stock went down again: 1) Nifty must have dropped down. 2) Some news. I guess there was a negative on fortis.
But next candle must have helped you to book profit . Closing time stocks tend to behave strangely.

1642 2018-04-05 11:51:15 Amazes me how many inv will insist on a bull that never dies and will put fresh capital to work on some hope/hype. YTD data is telling. Beware. Be careful. Recent high profile earn reports tanked those stocks on the earn or on guidesnce. Q1 earn season will be wild.

1651 2018-04-05 11:46:44 I'm sure there will be many attempts by those against the President to tank the market just like Rockefeller did in '29, selling off large quantities of stocks to cause a panic so he could rebuy shares he had plus more at lower prices.  That will just lead to us cutting ties...

1678 2018-04-05 11:28:17 This subject has become so broad that the actual message becomes lost so let's discuss one specific thing. Explain why #NRA refuses to support banning bump-stocks. Bump stocks turn a legal semi-auto rifle into an illegal fully automatic rifle and have been used in mass shootings.

Now, we are faced with a weapon that is just as dangerous as one we’ve already successfully “banned.” It took gun-lovers 20+ years to admit banning full auto was right, this will be the same way.
2137 2018-04-05 05:10:25 What I'm saying is, ban bump stocks. Flat out. No U.S. citizen needs to have any sort of military style rifle either. In D.C. vs Heller, the case in which made it legal to own firearms as a U.S. citizen, the court wrote (cont)

2139 2018-04-05 05:05:16 Second of all you make it sound as if bump stocks are commonly used in the military. That’s also false. Again, let’s listen to someone who actually raised their hand and took the oath of enlistment. Bump stocks are not used on ANY of the 5 weapons I’m qualified to use in the army

2143 2018-04-05 05:02:27 "assault rifles" were not illegal. everything that existed was grandfathered in. new rifles just couldnt have a number of "assault riffle" characteristics, like the very dangerous pistol grips, telescoping stocks, threaded barrels etc. Assault is a verb.

2173 2018-04-05 04:42:40 People are buying Bonds, stocks, property because they expect other people to buy it from them at a higher price. This is foolish
2174 2018-04-05 04:42:37 In the old days you use have to declare what set of stocks or indexes you would trade in. There were so many people on the floor that it didn't matter, but in theory they could have called you to the post of one of your stocks to make a market.

2177 2018-04-05 04:40:34 No, I don't know which way stocks will start tomorrow, which may have nothing to do with where they finish. I do know that if #Dow starts up, there will NOT be #media screaming headlines CREDITING #TRUMP. #Sociopaths (#media).

2190 2018-04-05 04:29:25 It's not that I don't have an idea of how high a stock may go. I'm typically looking for stocks with a minimum of 10-20% percent upside potential. That doesn't tell me however whether it's willing to give me less (or even a potential loss) or considerably more than I anticipated.

Today when someone asked if he can buy that stock as it has come down by 35% ,” तू देख ले यार मैंने तो बेच दिया “

2259 2018-04-05 03:39:20 Uh. No. I own stocks.
2260 2018-04-05 03:38:54 Background checks have nothing to do with 2a. I can support a background check. You do that for most jobs. Bump stocks, I can see that one. Those are not guns, those are mods.

2262 2018-04-05 03:37:14 For small retail intraday traders, my take would be you dont need to trade today. Its not your game today.

2265 2018-04-05 03:36:27 No. The polling is more specific than that. People are on-board with background checks, for example, and banning specific weapons and things like bump stocks.
2266 2018-04-05 03:36:18 Moral reasons don't work. you can't trade stocks in pharma and decry stocks of hospitals. Pharma companies are well-known to keep high MRP and sell to hospitals at 30-50% in bulk. can't run with hare n hunt with hounds.
2267 2018-04-05 03:36:14 What a joke. I can still use my debit card in a casino and buy shitty stocks that will tank during the next recession, right? Such double standards. Obviously the credit card companies are pushing for this

2270 2018-04-05 03:28:55 So far, I am pretty pleased. Isis gone, tax cuts (thanks, saving thousands), no more apology tours. Other countries chipping into NATO. Respect from other countries. Bringing N Korea to the table. My stocks up significantly since elected. And looking forward to border security.
2271 2018-04-05 03:27:04 You don’t need a bump stock to fire the gun like that. Hold it loosely and bounce it in your hands. The thing with bump stocks is they decrease the accuracy increase the fire rate and rate of jamming. There’s nothing mechanical to regulate and you can 3D print one with ease.
2272 2018-04-05 03:25:16 So let the market tank and have China raise tariffs on us and hurt farmers?  How are your helping middle America with that?  Oh and don't forget the people that either have their 401 in stocks and have lost money because stocks are going down??
2273 2018-04-05 03:24:51 He is talking about the unattractiveness of hospitals as an investment for him. Which is very valid. I dont like to think of anything that deals with blood as an investment either.  I know of very good doctors who also trade in stocks. Trading is not a dirty business.

2281 2018-04-05 03:18:12 So the trend with a lot of stocks has been a slump on news release. People say that's a "buy on the rumour, sell on the news" event but I fancy it was more price capping with those stocks. We'll see.
2282 2018-04-05 03:18:09 I can say a lot about why- In short , I have had no issues with them when I trade penny stocks.

2301 2018-04-05 03:04:12 A good rule of thumb is to have no more than 25% of your money in stocks 5 years prior to your retirement, in any market.
2302 2018-04-05 03:04:08 Look, I support tougher background checks (minus a national registry for potential confiscation...which wouldn't be enforced by law enforcement who largely support 2A), banning "Bump Stocks", but NO to banning semi-automatic rifles. We had that and it didn't work. Its a fact.

2320 2018-04-05 02:52:25 To be honest I already stated several stocks (ETF's) that I liked considerably lower today during market hours. Example $LABU $FAS $SHOP $TLRD etc.  I'm not anxiously looking for entries on other stocks based on their popularity.

2350 2018-04-05 02:28:39 They DO use knives and vehicles. And with them, they've a murder rate equal to approximately one-fifth of that of the United States. I guess they don't make bump-stocks for knives and vehicles.
2351 2018-04-05 02:28:03 I'd be happy if they banned hi velocity rifles - when those bullets go through a child's lung they shred the entire organ and leave all their blood on the floor, leaving nothing to save. And who needs 50 bullets/minute for protection? And bump stocks? Insane.

2358 2018-04-05 02:22:31 No. Stocks first. Job second.
2359 2018-04-05 02:22:30 Which is why most stocks are falling on their faces. At the time of buying, the story always feels convincing n a potential multibagger. Then with time most stories don't play out and the price momentum fizzles out
2360 2018-04-05 02:22:21 What you said is not an argument for allowing mentally ill or violent people easy access to guns. No one needs semi auto rifles or bump stocks. If you hunt with them, you suck and should go fishing... and they won’t hold off our military. 92% gun homicides are in the US.

2381 2018-04-05 02:04:58 I will follow up on this thought of tariffs ruining 401k 's etc. If you had invested in NTNX at $17 last august when I had it 4k shares of it and sold like a idiot , right now I would have made over $125k profit!! Great stocks exist in bull and bear markets , do your research!!

2384 2018-04-05 02:02:54 Trump is a fucking moron. He’s like a kid playing with toy soldiers. His lack of basic understanding on international diplomacy & economics can wind up crashing stocks and threatening our 401K retirement funds. That makes him a fucking soulless moron.

2386 2018-04-05 02:02:03 Not quite. The Dow Jones is an average of 30 stocks & is not as good an indicator as the S & P. Stocks all fluctuate based on confidence on earnings/ value. S & P increase 247% under Obama. One of biggest bull runs in history.

2388 2018-04-05 01:59:03 There is zero evidence of that, unless you have any? It has become the mantra for why stocks rally. Sorry, again not that simple

2394 2018-04-05 01:57:26 The stock market goes up and down each time there is news for or against the trade war.  Stock tanked early today.  An administration official AGAIN hinted that the tarriffs might not be put into place.  Stocks rally.

2407 2018-04-05 01:49:07 I find it very strange how a lot of "traders" won't buy a stock that is barely moving or has low volume, yet it is sitting on support and low risk

But chase stocks that are already running, more often than not they get burnt. 

Madness!

Stalk and wait, don't chase.
2408 2018-04-05 01:49:07 Hopefully they ask about the $millions in stocks he sold just before the bad PR released and his stock tumbled.  Sounds a little Martha Stewart like if you ask me....

I not believe in it

2435 2018-04-05 01:33:49 Wait you would rather ban all guns instead of one type?
Let’s be reasonable: not all guns are equally dangerous. Handguns have smaller clip capacity and can’t have added bump stocks. People want guns for hunting/safety which is fine. But rifles are unnecessarily too powerful
2436 2018-04-05 01:32:07 Game? You’re not reading the same filings and disclosures I am, apparently. It’s all right there. This company appears to be garbage and never should have been listed on a major exchange.

2495 2018-04-05 00:57:33 They oppose the bump stock bill because of the vague wording than effectively bans most modifications like, lighter triggers, pistol grips, scopes, adjustable stocks, etc. Read the bill and we can debate this further, you need to know exactly what your advocating for.
2496 2018-04-05 00:54:43 There better be a RICO case for every single one of them.  If they get to keep all their gains, the Republic is gone.  Now tell me their not selling short the tech stocks in their portfolio.  Another illegal act by trump talking negatively about Amazon and nobody has the balls.
2497 2018-04-05 00:54:36 What stocks of Novichok do you hold at Porton Down?  Does the formula match the formula used in the Skripal attack?  Can you be 100% certain that Novichok from Porton Down was not used in the attack?
2498 2018-04-05 00:54:03 Yeah cuz rolling back Obama, and regs, tax cuts, deporting illegals, beating ISIS, bringing back jobs, 25% up in stocks, booming economy....that doesn't count. You're just pissed Barry's fake lib utopia is long gone 
2499 2018-04-05 00:53:20 Bumps stocks are barely used by people. The guy who shot up Vegas had a bump stock on none of the guns he used.  Looked at the pic. CCW with need, stupid. Who besides the person who want's it should decide Fienstien was allowed 1.
2500 2018-04-05 00:52:58 Your analysis team is sleeping. Try looking into stock trades just prior to those stocks tanking, and after they hit new lows. There's something fishy about who owns stock in what around the time Trump makes those announcements.

2505 2018-04-05 00:51:13 Like lighter triggers, which impedes the elderly or those with disabilities like carpal tunnel. Among many other things like grips, scopes, and adjustable stocks. A bill banning a specific modification like a bump stock is something I support, just arbitrarily banning everything
2506 2018-04-05 00:50:20 Hi Steven, I would like to know which broker do you use for Shorting stocks. I'm using TD AMERITRADE But i couldn't able sell short for few stocks. Please let me know.

2509 2018-04-05 00:47:13 I’m not opposed to banning bump stocks, but it’s a technique you don’t even need the modification to use. It’s also been used in only one crime ever, so not very effective at reducing gun crimes.

2543 2018-04-05 00:29:49 happy with the action. happy to own it if price is above.

2553 2018-04-05 00:25:36 Sorry, I have no idea why. However, stocks with high short interest near new highs may have additional fuel to the upside when shorts become buyers in a short squeeze, so watch out for that.
2554 2018-04-05 00:24:44 2/ This only applies to truly decentralized autonomous "social utility." There are reasons tokens can be issued for for-profit (e.g. stocks, bank units of account, other systems that require centralized control) and this doesn't necessarily apply.

2560 2018-04-05 00:22:35 Agreed I only go long stocks with high short interest.

Enron had no shorts, was a fraud went to zero. Thereby, $tsla is always going to go up because there are shorts

2561 2018-04-05 00:22:28 2/try to merge w Disney eventually. AT&T is in it for world dominance. The problem is is that our stock returns are at 1% on a yearly basis when most are at a 5 to 7% because they’re using our money to buy out others and they’re splitting our stocks.
2562 2018-04-05 00:21:14 Joel Payne’s answer to what would have prevented the Florida school shooting is “Trump did not ban bump stocks?”  What a stupid answer..if he wants to get political then he needs to know that it was Obama’s ATF that made bump stocks legal..tired of these stupid leftist!  #Tucker
2563 2018-04-05 00:20:27 And why do you think you will do that? Predicting businesses over the long term is hard. 

Predicting stocks over the one-day time period harder.

Why do the super hard stuff?

2567 2018-04-05 00:19:30 When U ask dumicrats what law can B passed 2 stop shootings. The 1st thing out their mouth is Trump can ban bump stocks. What they really mean is remove the 2nd amendment.

2572 2018-04-05 00:18:40 @paynedc Gun laws you advocate are already on the books. the NRA does not support Gun Manufacturers. They teach gun safety, are against bump stocks and support the 2nd amendment. As Tucker said. Understand guns & understand the NRA before you talk about them.
2573 2018-04-05 00:17:45 Joel has no answers. Typical leftist. Tucker asked what would have prevented Parkland shooting? He said The Pres could have banned bump stocks. Lol. They have no clue or answers. Good job Tucker. You show they have no clue with the upmost respect. I love it. Keep after them
2574 2018-04-05 00:17:43 @TuckerCarlson Trump DID ban bump stocks! He also passed a bill with a lot of school safety measures and we have laws against mentally ill getting guns already!That man obviously is not informed!Criminals will not give up their guns & most are illegal!
