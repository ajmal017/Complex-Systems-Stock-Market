0 2018-10-09 23:52:37 @SEaqub would you agree NZ's surplus and to a greater degree Australia's were luck not good management. Currencies, commodities and demand/supply. Both nations surpluses were better, they were not expected - let alone planned.

2 2018-10-09 23:48:43 It not only stands with its feet on the ground, but, in relation to all other commodities, it stands on its head, and evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas, far more wonderful than “table-turning” ever was.
3 2018-10-09 23:45:18 Quem não reconhece seus erros está fadado a repetí-los. PT nunca quis reconhecer os seus próprios e assim como na campanha de Dilma, nos "vendem" um país que não existe. Devolver o "Brasil de Lula" é o mesmo que afirmar que haverá um novo superciclo de commodities. Impossivel!
4 2018-10-09 23:34:18 Capitalism thrives on  your addiction to its commodities, these commodities include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth etc etc
5 2018-10-09 23:25:12 Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth don't let them phase you
6 2018-10-09 23:23:50 Lol, wait until there are millennials in Congress. They'll start wars and run up debt as much as anyone else.  Probably more so on the debt issue, considering how many commodities millennials think are rights.
7 2018-10-09 22:56:17 I'm sorry is there any evidence you have to refute all this winning?

BTW you can go to MarketWatch and check out DXY the dollar index.  We're plowing the world as commodities particularly the #1 industry in the world (Oil) trade by dollars
8 2018-10-09 22:54:48 Higher interest rates are always bad for commodities, including oil.

If @realDonaldTrump & @stevenmnuchin1 are going to succeed, they must put brakes on the FED.

10 2018-10-09 22:46:16 Something just hit the fan. The stock market is going down and commodities are going up... Wall Street is bracing itself for an #OctoberSurprise
11 2018-10-09 22:37:06 @3HL1045 everyone calling for Dez must have forgotten how the Andre Johnson and Randy Moss signings worked out for us. Known commodities at the end of their career = NOPE
12 2018-10-09 22:28:07 World market prices on the rise, watch out for the reflection in the prices of the commodities soon.
13 2018-10-09 22:24:30 @theprophet_5 - Goona real miss you this year - composure and leadership are rare commodities - wishing u all the best - Go Blue!
14 2018-10-09 22:12:32 Commodity prices didn't benefit the country purely from sale of actual commodities themselves but also ushered in bullish investors who were keen to reap rewards in spite of political risk they were not drawn by MDC charm. As commodities crushed investors are more cautious...
15 2018-10-09 22:10:22 So now he os acknowledging that there is a shortage of something. Isn't he the one who was denying that there are a lot of shortages of basic commodities in zim a few days back?
16 2018-10-09 22:07:31 Hay marcas? o hay mucho commodities llamados marcas en el sector? Pero posicionadas no hay dentro de las primeras 100.
